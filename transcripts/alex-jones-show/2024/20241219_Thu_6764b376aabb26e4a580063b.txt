[00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.950]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.710]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the Infowars.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.700]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.539]  What you see in the distance is the Chizos mountain range and then Mexico.
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:55.359]  And flying above Mexico is what appears to be a large passenger jet throwing off ice crystals behind it from condensation off the wings.
[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.219]  Now, that's normal.
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.460]  Condensation trail.
[00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:02.100]  Contrail.
[00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.219]  Been observed.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.060]  You know, going back since aircraft went higher up in the atmosphere in the 1930s.
[00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:10.459]  Okay?
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.819]  And it's flying, you can see it.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.420]  35,000 feet or so.
[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.819]  Okay?
[00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:26.019]  You look at modern cities and you look at the United States, Europe, where it's the worst.
[00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.519]  You'll see, quote, condensation trails at a few thousand feet in the summer.
[00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:33.140]  You'll see them at 5,000 feet in the summer.
[00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.219]  That's impossible.
[00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:36.200]  Then they dissipate.
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.599]  And we know they're adding aluminum salts Bury a whole bunch of other crap in these aerosol sprays.
[00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:46.780]  Radioactive isotopes, you name it.
[00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.040]  And they form nuclei in the atmosphere.
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.280]  They get dispersed by the jet engines.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.319]  There's patents on it.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.260]  I've been covering this for 30 years.
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.799]  And this really started 30 years ago.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.400]  Some of these researchers were telling me when I first got on air about how they were adding stuff to jet fuel midpoint to weather.
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.140]  And I was like, really?
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.480]  And I didn't know it was true or not.
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.620]  Now it's all declassified.
[00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.060]  The former CIA director, when he was CIA director, admitted it all.
[00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.930]  Brennan, as you know, anybody just type in CIA director on geoengineering.
[00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.969]  But what's frustrating is, it's still the general public.
[00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.590]  They don't know it.
[00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.729]  They think it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.169]  Corporate media told them.
[00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.650]  It's kind of like when they put fluoride in the water in 1946, they knew it caused cancer and infertility.
[00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.229]  There was a big debate about it.
[00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.569]  The toxicologists and scientists spoke out.
[00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.710]  The government just said, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:38.629]  And now, of course, the FDA admits, okay, it causes brain damage, lower IQ, infertility, cancer.
[00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:42.409]  So, this is just a fact going on.
[00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.330]  Like the secret space program.
[00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.870]  And then the publisher goes, no, it doesn't exist.
[00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.030]  They just keep you in the dark when so much of it is already on record.
[00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.889]  So, beautiful day.
[00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.889]  See that passenger liner going off into the distance.
[00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:59.569]  It's going.
[00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.349]  Kind of southwest.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:13.580]  And you notice those crystals are dissipating because they're not finding enough water vapor to form bigger nuclei that would form clouds and then rain.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.840]  And then, oh, Bill Gates wants to control the weather by adding some of the jet fuel to give the Earth sunscreen to stop global warming.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.020]  Oh, but if you notice it, you're bad.
[00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.560]  But it's not stop global warming.
[00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:25.219]  It's terraforming.
[00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:26.939]  It's playing God.
[00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.479]  So they always go, you're dumb.
[00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:30.599]  That's an ice crystal.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.099]  That's an ice crystal.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.400]  No, that's not the big formations you see everywhere.
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.319]  Big difference.
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:50.120]  One that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI. A method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:58.120]  Bill Gates is backing the first high-altitude experiment of one radical climate change solution, creating a massive chemical cloud that could cool the earth.
[00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.680]  It's called solar geoengineering, and it's highly controversial.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.680]  Everything I do is climate conscious.
[00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.689]  You can spray something into the atmosphere to change, okay, okay.
[00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.310]  Spray pollution.
[00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:13.949]  You could actually spray sulfuric acid into the stratosphere, 20 kilometers over our head.
[00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:20.310]  Thousands of planes would fly very high and use nozzles to inject millions of tons of light-reflecting particles into the stratosphere.
[00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:26.430]  It would create a thin chemical cloud of those particles around the whole planet, blocking some sunlight from reaching the surface.
[00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.870]  It would mimic a giant volcanic eruption, which we know cools the Earth.
[00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:38.629]  And it's so obvious when they do this in Austin, Texas.
[00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:42.870]  Now it's so predictable what's gonna come next.
[00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.990]  You see myself, Rob Dew, others posting on X about it.
[00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:48.329]  I say it on my show.
[00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.750]  It's like, oh, they just chemtrailed us today.
[00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.269]  It's gonna rain the next 24 hours.
[00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.129]  And then it does and you don't see the sun for two days.
[00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.569]  But you're a conspiracy theorist just for pointing that out, just for seeing that, just for having eyes that work and believe your own lion eyes.
[00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:03.579]  All right, folks, we got big breaking news.
[00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.819]  What is their next plan to sabotage the Trump administration?
[00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:07.660]  We've got it.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.459]  It's Thursday, December 19, 2024. I'm taping this and uploading it to X at 1040 Central Standard Time.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.360]  This is a maximum tyranny alert.
[00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:27.680]  The Democrats, as I predicted, are announcing emergencies in different cities and counties, including California, declaring an emergency over bird flu.
[00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:30.540]  I'll be on the air with Owen Schroyer at 11 a.m.
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.339]  in just a few minutes breaking all this down.
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.319]  It coincides with other pandemic rollouts in areas of Europe, Australia, and more.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.899]  This is the globalist move.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.120]  They admit it's their move.
[00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:47.180]  They've bragged it's meant to block the global populist Victories in Canada and the UK and Germany.
[00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.199]  We are taking the planet by storm.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.480]  The Great Awakening is here now.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:06:03.879]  But inside Congress, in this continual resolution mass spending bill that Trump and Musk and Vance have decried, there is the most tyrannical medical tyranny you've ever seen.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.279]  Forced lockdowns, forced injections, quarantining of people against their will, including political dissidents.
[00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:13.240]  Everything that's in the UN treaty that they couldn't get passed is in this.
[00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.649]  And of course, it's been Biden and his people that actually wrote the UN treaty that's come out.
[00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.209]  So this is huge.
[00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:24.769]  They're making their move with Disease X right now, saying it's in the milk, saying it's in the chickens.
[00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:27.230]  It's all made up crap, saying there's human cases.
[00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.990]  You read deep, it's all made up crap.
[00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:35.060]  We're good to go.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:55.899]  They're using the last pandemic law Congress passed for secretly injecting kids in public and private schools and not telling their parents in seven states.
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.160]  Supreme Courts have said they can inject your kids illegally without your consent, and they don't get in trouble.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.879]  This is a medical power grab.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.660]  This is tyranny.

[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.220]  I've filed a detailed report of all of this and more.
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.660]  Join us now and share this report and the live feeds at realalexjones.
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.000]  The mall's in your court.
[00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:18.360]  Don't fucking let them win.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.160]  Don't let him get away with this, dammit.
[00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:21.240]  This is disgusting.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.939]  Lockdowns, masks, forced injections, all of it.
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.079]  Don't let him do it!
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.019]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:41.439]  We are now live inside the Infowars World Headquarters on this Thursday, December 19th, 2024. And let me explain how some things work here.
[00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:50.509]  Before I lay into this stack of news, and then we have more special reports from Alex coming up.
[00:07:51.209 --> 00:07:59.889]  You hear him shouting at the end of that short video clip, and I will tell you there is nothing fake about that.
[00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:17.060]  Now, I host the War Room here at 3 to 6 p.m., and I don't normally We're good to go.
[00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:33.710]  And I lay that out because when I'm doing the War Room, I'm completely in charge of that.
[00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.230]  Alex doesn't tell me what to do.
[00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:40.990]  But when I'm hosting his show, he'll give me a call before and he'll say, what are you going to be covering today?
[00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.049]  Here's my big story.
[00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:43.649]  I'm going to be filing special reports.
[00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:48.710]  Do you think you can hammer, can you hammer this in between my special reports?
[00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.950]  I say, yeah, what are you, what are you going to be your lead today?
[00:08:53.049 --> 00:08:53.750]  And he says...
[00:08:54.730 --> 00:09:02.009]  They're going to push this pandemic and they're going to use it instead of on the back end of Trump's term.
[00:09:02.309 --> 00:09:04.929]  Now they're going to use it to sabotage the front end.
[00:09:06.809 --> 00:09:08.690]  I'm going to be filing some special reports.
[00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:15.029]  Can you do a longer segment kind of hammering it all out and laying it all out in between my special reports?
[00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.409]  But no problem, boss.
[00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:16.929]  You got it.
[00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.009]  So I say, what are the telltale signs?
[00:09:22.169 --> 00:09:28.120]  What will people be able to look at And see, okay, this is what they're trying to do.
[00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:39.919]  I'm going to read for you dozens, probably over 30 headlines, and I'll tell you the source as well so you can see it, so you can get full spectrum here.
[00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:48.279]  All the mainstream news, this is all in the last 24 hours, telling you another pandemic is coming.
[00:09:50.809 --> 00:09:56.889]  We're going to intertwine that into what was in the continued resolution bill yesterday that is now dead on arrival.
[00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.190]  They didn't even get a vote on it.
[00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.110]  Speaker Johnson is removing himself from political events now.
[00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.210]  It's a complete disaster.
[00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.710]  Democrats are bitching and whining.
[00:10:06.149 --> 00:10:07.149]  We'll have all that.
[00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:11.909]  But it intertwines with that because they had pandemic response in there.
[00:10:12.049 --> 00:10:13.230]  They had mask mandates.
[00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:14.990]  They had vaccine mandates.
[00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:25.190]  They had the medical tyranny cooked into this bill that would have Ushered in all the pandemic tyranny that they're now promoting in the mainstream news.
[00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:31.029]  So you see, it was the two-pronged attack before Trump even gets into office.
[00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.809]  Boom, you hit them all with the pandemic.
[00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.750]  Boom, you hit them with the continued resolution that brings in the legislation for the medical tyranny.
[00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:43.009]  Then his term begins, then the pandemic begins, and then they just crush.
[00:10:43.169 --> 00:10:45.769]  They don't even let him get his feet on the ground.
[00:10:45.909 --> 00:10:47.470]  They just crush everything before it even starts.
[00:10:48.289 --> 00:10:49.629]  We cannot let this happen.
[00:10:49.789 --> 00:10:55.950]  And if you look at how we had a huge victory stopping this continued resolution yesterday, we can have a big victory on this as well.
[00:10:56.289 --> 00:10:57.970]  But it has to be heard.
[00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:08.809]  It has to be heard by the same millions of Americans that voiced their opinions loud and clear yesterday that stopped this bill from being passed.
[00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.909]  And then we're going to close the door.
[00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.909]  And this is where it gets even more eerie.
[00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:21.470]  With Peter Hotez saying, day one of Trump's administration, there's going to be a pandemic.
[00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.409]  And we all remember the Simpsons clip.
[00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:26.929]  Somehow the Simpsons predicts all this stuff.
[00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:30.450]  I don't know if Matt Groening has a time machine or what it is.
[00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:38.370]  But if you remember in that clip, there was a certain thing that they said specifically was going to cause the next pandemic.
[00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:43.259]  Well, guess what's in the headlines I'm about to read?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.340]  That exact thing.
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.360]  So, here we go.
[00:11:47.659 --> 00:11:58.779]  I'm gonna tell you the source of these headlines, and I'm gonna read for you probably two, three dozen headlines right now, all in the last 24 hours, telling you there's a pandemic coming.
[00:12:00.599 --> 00:12:07.440]  And remember, as you're hearing this, they were supposed to pass this continued resolution that had all the medical tyranny cooked into it.
[00:12:07.539 --> 00:12:16.200]  So it would have been, here comes the pandemic, here's the medical tyranny, Trump's administration begins, pandemic begins, medical tyranny takes place, they crush him before it even starts.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.620]  But we're gonna get ahead of it and we're gonna stop it.
[00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:20.250]  Here we go.
[00:12:20.549 --> 00:12:21.649]  Washington Post.
[00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:25.789]  USC's first severe case of bird flu in Louisiana.
[00:12:25.789 --> 00:12:27.350]  This is all last 24 hours.
[00:12:27.529 --> 00:12:28.269]  Okay, Washington Post.
[00:12:28.429 --> 00:12:29.330]  Bird flu, Louisiana.

[00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:43.950]  Okay.

[00:17:22.519 --> 00:17:26.579]  The bird flu makes the presidential transition problematic.
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.000]  How perfect.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:29.759]  Perfect.
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.700]  First time the timing was perfect.
[00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:37.619]  Right up before the election to crush the economy and cause social distress.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.900]  Blame it all on Trump.
[00:17:39.579 --> 00:17:40.720]  Steal the election.
[00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:41.859]  Perfect timing.
[00:17:42.539 --> 00:17:48.880]  This go around, they're just going to do it right before his inauguration and just crush his incoming administration before it even starts.
[00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:51.079]  That's their plan here.
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.960]  Unless we can stop them.

[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.299]  And then The Guardian.
[00:18:12.599 --> 00:18:16.559]  Two California house cats die from bird flu as three more appear to be infected.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.740]  So let's do this.
[00:18:19.349 --> 00:18:23.890]  I just ran through all the mainstream headlines all the last 24 hours telling you bird flu pandemic is coming.
[00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:32.430]  We have the clip of Peter Hotez saying, oh, on January 21st, there's going to be a wave of pandemics.
[00:18:32.609 --> 00:18:33.670]  It's going to hit the Trump administration.
[00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.730]  Oh, how convenient, because that's how science and viruses work.
[00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:40.589]  They just pick a date and they say, we're launching on this date.
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:46.599]  Or maybe they say, hey, there's new incoming administration, so let's cause a pandemic then.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.880]  I mean, that's what viruses are doing, running around scheming like that, according to Peter Hotez.
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.400]  But hold on a second.
[00:18:54.859 --> 00:18:57.099]  Cats could spark the next pandemic?
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.420]  House cats dying from bird flu could cause the next pandemic?
[00:19:02.519 --> 00:19:04.819]  The Simpsons, famous for predicting things.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:11.809]  We thought that they were predicting it in 2020, but Maybe we were just five years early.
[00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.250]  Here's that famous Simpsons prediction.
[00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:16.569]  Little reminder, one more time.
[00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.650]  I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.
[00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:32.230]  We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong and dark rooms glued to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials.
[00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:33.470]  Well, I think...
[00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.150]  NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.
[00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.569]  I think we should go with the good old-fashioned public health scare.
[00:19:41.059 --> 00:19:41.940]  A new disease.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:42.859]  No one's immune.
[00:19:43.019 --> 00:19:46.400]  It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.359]  And instead of summer, it's all the time.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.160]  Now, I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.819]  He loves being that guy.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.240]  But, Janice, we do have standards.
[00:19:57.579 --> 00:19:59.059]  This can't be a made-up disease.
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:03.799]  The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.420]  We do have something we've been holding onto, but it hasn't been tested.
[00:20:07.759 --> 00:20:10.640]  Get over here, NBC. Oh, well...
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.839]  Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I... Oh!
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:16.980]  Wow!
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:17.900]  Wow!
[00:20:18.059 --> 00:20:18.859]  Oh, yeah!
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.880]  So, we've got our deadly disease.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:28.160]  Now, we just have to blame it on something that's in every household, something that people are a little bit afraid of already.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.839]  House cat flu is coming, people!
[00:20:31.019 --> 00:20:38.519]  The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some degree of probability that the house cat flu might spread in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern.
[00:20:40.109 --> 00:20:45.970]  So Petter beware, that warm body on your lap just might be ready to destroy your tender fiddles.
[00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:59.730]  So, mainstream media meets in secret, says we're going to launch a pandemic and blame it on the cats.
[00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.670]  That was the actual Simpson prediction.
[00:21:02.849 --> 00:21:05.349]  Now that's what the mainstream media is doing today.
[00:21:05.349 --> 00:21:13.769]  So maybe we were just five years early to the Simpsons predicted it in 2020. So that's a little more fun.
[00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.190]  The good news is we control our destiny now.
[00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:21.210]  The crooks, the propaganda agents, the deep state, they used to control our destiny.
[00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:22.329]  We're taking it back.
[00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.529]  Yesterday, defeating the continued resolution is a very important part of that.
[00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:26.910]  And it all actually...
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:28.940]  Plays into this as well.
[00:21:29.119 --> 00:21:31.440]  But okay, here's something less funny.
[00:21:32.299 --> 00:21:44.380]  Here's vaccine pusher, big pharma shill, quite strange individual, Peter Hotez, saying, oh, yep, soon as Trump becomes president, there's going to be more virus outbreaks, because that's how science works.
[00:21:45.299 --> 00:21:55.279]  Here's the reason why we need to care about this stuff, Nicole, is that we have some big picture stuff coming down the pike starting on January 21st.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.640]  Mr. Bloomberg mentioned H5N1. That I'm really worried about.
[00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:05.339]  It's all over wild birds on the western part of the United States and going up in the north.
[00:22:05.339 --> 00:22:06.680]  It's getting into the poultry.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.299]  We're seeing sporadic human cases.
[00:22:09.299 --> 00:22:12.440]  No human-to-human transmission yet, but that could happen.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.259]  It's in the cattle.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:14.019]  It's in the milk.
[00:22:14.299 --> 00:22:15.400]  And that's just the beginning.
[00:22:15.579 --> 00:22:19.279]  We have another major coronavirus likely brewing in Asia.
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:29.039]  We've had SARS in 2002, SARS-2 COVID-19 in 2019. And we know these viruses are jumping from bats to people thousands of times a year.
[00:22:29.369 --> 00:22:30.789]  But there's still more.
[00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:45.910]  We know that we have a big problem with mosquito-transmitted viruses all along the Gulf Coast, where I am here in Texas, or expecting dengue and possibly Zika virus coming back, or Apuche virus, maybe even yellow fever.
[00:22:46.109 --> 00:22:46.950]  And there's more.
[00:22:47.109 --> 00:23:02.359]  Then we have all this sharp rise in vaccine-preventable diseases going up because of, in part, the anti-vaccine activism that's so We have a five-fold rise in pertussis cases, whooping cough over the last year, 15 measles outbreaks this year.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.700]  We've got polio that's been in the wastewater in New York State.
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.940]  All that's going to come crashing down on January 21st on the Trump administration.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.460]  We need a really, really good team to be able to handle this.
[00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:20.049]  Oh, it's all going to come crashing down day one of the Trump administration, and it's the vaccine skeptics that are the problem.
[00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.789]  They're causing it.
[00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:24.250]  You see the narrative that they're setting up here?
[00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:27.269]  With all the headlines, all the predictions.
[00:23:28.609 --> 00:23:35.849]  And then, in the continued resolution, multiple instances here of...
[00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:49.250]  We're good to go.
[00:23:52.970 --> 00:24:03.569]  You also have an entire section, pandemic and all hazards, preparedness and response with all kinds of medical tyranny in there, masks, vaccines, lockdowns.
[00:24:03.869 --> 00:24:08.349]  And then you add 12 grants for 12 new bio labs as well.
[00:24:08.579 --> 00:24:15.039]  They had new bio labs that they were going to fund and run, which is, of course, where the first virus and pandemic came out of that they lied to you about.
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:27.900]  And by the way, that Russian general that got killed in Moscow a few days ago, he was the original Russian general and scientist who was calling out the Ukrainian bio labs and sent in the Russian military to shut them down.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.519]  So, hmm, you got that going on, too.
[00:24:30.619 --> 00:24:35.079]  Now, I got these other headlines where they're warning about COVID, but that's kind of just inside.
[00:24:35.259 --> 00:24:37.019]  They really want to scare you with bird flu.
[00:24:38.569 --> 00:24:42.250]  Wreck the incoming Trump administration day one, declare a pandemic.
[00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:52.529]  Now, the real threat is they could release a deadly virus and not just do a total fear mongering scam like they did in 2020. They could release a real virus and that could be worse.
[00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.329]  But they wanna get ahead of this next incoming administration.
[00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.190]  They don't wanna wait for Trump to get in office.
[00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:01.170]  They wanna do it now and all of the proof is in the pudding.
[00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.690]  Every single mainstream news outlet telling you the pandemic is coming.
[00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:11.410]  All their COVID-pushing, vaccine-pushing scientists, doctors, psychotics telling you it's gonna happen day one.
[00:25:11.589 --> 00:25:15.049]  Cooking it into the continued resolution bill, the tyranny, it's all there.
[00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.190]  Here's Alex Jones with the latest report.
[00:25:19.009 --> 00:25:29.150]  It is Thursday, December 19th, 2024. We are 32 days out for President Trump being inaugurated.
[00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:42.329]  And as I warned you, as I predicted hundreds of times, the deep state was going to launch a new pandemic hysteria power grab and lockdown starting in the blue states and blue cities.
[00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:46.950]  Governor Newsom has declared a state of emergency over bird flu in California.
[00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:49.750]  It's all based on fraud on the PCR test.
[00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.289]  It is all a lie, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:53.859]  We can stop them.
[00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:55.319]  The public is awake.
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:00.460]  We have broken their backs when it comes to the censorship, and the truth is getting out.
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:12.559]  Coming up in the next segment, I am going to break down all of this in detail with the documents, the clips, the research, all of it, and how we are going to stop them.
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.380]  Also, we've got other incredible developments.
[00:26:15.619 --> 00:26:26.869]  As I told you weeks ago and as we confirmed two days ago, They are now confirming in Trudeau's own party that they're going to vote him out and that he is about to be removed if he doesn't resign.
[00:26:27.089 --> 00:26:35.130]  Also, Keira Starmer just canceled elections because he has less than a 16% approval rating and so does his party.
[00:26:35.329 --> 00:26:51.329]  These are all WEF globalist stooges, but they are going to try the new plandemic The new lockdowns, all the tyranny, all the assaults, all the water cannons, all the masking of kids, all the poison shots for the bird flu,
[00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:59.109]  all of it based on the fraudulent PCR test that the inventor of it said was a fraud when they turned it up.
[00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.390]  So this is incredible.
[00:27:00.569 --> 00:27:05.289]  That's why these criminals need to be exposed for their past crimes so they can't do it again.
[00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:10.750]  We're about to lay it out today, but the globalists are in free fall, populists are being elected everywhere.
[00:27:11.559 --> 00:27:21.559]  Trump is coming roaring into office and they need these new lockdowns and new hysteria and fear to continue to shut down the economy and block the recovery.
[00:27:21.799 --> 00:27:32.720]  This is a war for the future of civilization and that's why Infowars is so critical because we are the most accurate when it comes to analyzing the globalist plans and stopping them dead in their tracks.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.900]  We'll break it all down coming up right now.
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:45.200]  Optimal Human is the strongest, best, superfood, green drink you're going to find anywhere.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.599]  One little scoop in water.
[00:27:46.839 --> 00:27:48.660]  The energy, the focus, the clarity.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.079]  It is the best green food out there.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:51.880]  People love it.

[00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:09.059]  The U.S. trustee's still been left there, though it was over.
[00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:13.509]  The judge said you're actually gonna sell it to who actually offers the most money.
[00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:19.289]  We're gonna work on that with outside groups that won't censor us, but who knows what Soros and Bloomberg are gonna do.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.900]  But regardless, we continue on.

[00:30:01.309 --> 00:30:02.509]  Merry Christmas!
[00:30:06.509 --> 00:30:07.309]  It's official.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.359]  The globalists are now trying to launch a new pandemic hysteria.
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:17.119]  Lockdowns, forced injections, a completely collapsed economy.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.819]  We have the facts.
[00:30:19.099 --> 00:30:20.200]  We know what the criminals are trying.
[00:30:20.599 --> 00:30:27.799]  We've got to get the word out and we can stop them before we go through this nightmare hell again and tens of millions are killed.
[00:30:42.289 --> 00:31:00.859]  Just as I have predicted hundreds and hundreds of times in the last year, as soon as President Trump was president-elect in those 76 days between him being inaugurated on January 20th, next month, They would launch a new pandemic hysteria.
[00:31:01.619 --> 00:31:19.019]  Then their new globalist spokesperson, he's been a spokesperson for a long time, but he's the top guy now in the US. Dr. Peter Hotez came out two weeks ago and said Trump will have a new pandemic come crashing down on him and it will take control basically of his agenda.
[00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:37.289]  And now Governor Newsom yesterday declared a statewide emergency in California because one new first severe case in a human in Louisiana above 65 with pre-existing conditions has severe bird flu.
[00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.869]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is ridiculous.
[00:31:40.869 --> 00:31:57.950]  The same stuff they pulled with COVID. People with multiple comorbidities, cancer, other serious diseases, and then saying that COVID was killing them, then denying people access To medical clinics and hospitals for the regular flu or colds,
[00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:07.269]  then they would die and they would say, oh my goodness, it's because of COVID. You better take this shot that actually then turns off your immune system.
[00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:11.569]  Now they've got all the dead and dying from that, and they're gonna start saying, it's bird flu.
[00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:14.869]  We have predicted this hundreds and hundreds of times.
[00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:31.630]  We're about to lay it all out now, right now, and how we stop Here's the reason why we need to care about this stuff,
[00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:38.950]  Nicole, is that we have some big picture stuff coming down the pike starting on January 21st.
[00:32:39.369 --> 00:32:43.309]  Mr. Bloomberg mentioned H5N1. That I'm really worried about.
[00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:49.009]  It's all over wild birds on the western part of the United States and going up in the north.
[00:32:49.009 --> 00:32:50.349]  It's getting into the poultry.
[00:32:50.529 --> 00:32:52.970]  We're seeing sporadic human cases.
[00:32:53.109 --> 00:32:56.109]  No human-to-human transmission yet, but that could happen.
[00:32:56.109 --> 00:32:56.930]  It's in the cattle.
[00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:57.710]  It's in the milk.
[00:32:57.849 --> 00:32:59.109]  And that's just the beginning.
[00:32:59.589 --> 00:33:02.230]  People ask me, how are you able to predict all of this?
[00:33:02.589 --> 00:33:04.390]  The UN's been saying for decades.
[00:33:05.309 --> 00:33:20.490]  That they're going to use the fear of disease X, any new disease or any new virus they release or any new hype of an even non-existent virus that they promote to scare people into submission to bring in a world ID,
[00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:30.309]  a global vaccine passport, which again will be used as the internet ID, which will be used to track and control with a social credit score everything you do.
[00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:33.970]  So right on time, they're doing this.
[00:33:36.309 --> 00:33:40.849]  This is how the big financial interest want to shut down a Trump recovery.
[00:33:41.759 --> 00:34:06.200]  The private owners of the BlackRock Vanguard State Street System that control over 80% of world assets have openly said they're using these hyped up pandemics, these psychological warfare operations to shut down economies, make the general public go bankrupt and be poor because the central banks didn't loan the government's individuals fiat money and get them deeper into debt for social control,
[00:34:06.579 --> 00:34:07.900]  for domestication.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.219]  They don't want you to be independent.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:20.980]  And so we knew that they would use racial division, civil uprising to try to destabilize Trump once he got in, and a new pandemic, or pandemics, or plandemics.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:28.500]  And now they're doing it, and they're basing it all on a PCR test that the inventor of it explained, if you turn it up any, it'll give you false positives.
[00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:37.539]  Well, they turned these up 30, 40, even 50 times, and now they're pointing them at cow's milk, they're pointing them at chickens, and saying that they have it, and forcing them to be slaughtered.
[00:34:37.869 --> 00:34:40.989]  To also further shut down the economy.
[00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:51.289]  So this is a major assault on the Renaissance, on a laissez-faire, wealthy world, wealthy people, wealthy individuals, the general public being upwardly mobile.
[00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:56.610]  This is war against the population and we can stop it if we understand it.
[00:34:56.789 --> 00:34:59.570]  So the new pandemic hysteria is here.
[00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.250]  The main counter to Western civilization for the great reset.
[00:35:03.969 --> 00:35:07.750]  To collapse civilization and on its ashes, build the globalist technocracy.
[00:35:08.369 --> 00:35:13.429]  They are following a script, whether it's Australia, Germany, the United States, Canada, it doesn't matter.
[00:35:13.909 --> 00:35:32.309]  They are all being directed by the WEF and the UN, and you're gonna see more blue states and blue cities start shutting down, creating hysteria, When there are deaths from the cold and flu, and for people that have had their immune systems erased by the poison mRNA shots,
[00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:38.670]  which is at record levels, they will attribute that to the bird flu by setting the PCR test fraudulently.
[00:35:38.889 --> 00:35:41.250]  And we're supposed to just all go along with this.
[00:35:41.789 --> 00:35:46.949]  And with it, Facebook and Google will of course censor again and suppress the truth about what's happening.
[00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:50.289]  But thank God for X. Thank God for InfoWars.
[00:35:50.369 --> 00:35:51.230]  Thank God for Rumble.
[00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:52.510]  Thank God for all of you.
[00:35:52.769 --> 00:35:56.789]  We can get the facts out and expose this because our enemies have been arrogant.
[00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:58.090]  It came out.
[00:35:58.579 --> 00:36:13.860]  That right before they released COVID in 2020, they had their tabletop exercise event 201 and others bragging about the power grab and how they would create the fear and how they would have six feet separation and the mask and all of it.
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.019]  It's admitted they got caught.
[00:36:16.219 --> 00:36:17.519]  They lied about everything.
[00:36:17.699 --> 00:36:20.300]  And then of course the shots didn't work, didn't project you.
[00:36:20.539 --> 00:36:25.900]  Thousands of studies now confirming you're way more likely to quote, get COVID if you've had the shots or anything else.
[00:36:26.579 --> 00:36:27.760]  So we have to come together.
[00:36:28.039 --> 00:36:29.340]  We have to be very vocal.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.739]  We have to speak out now and get ahead of this.
[00:36:32.139 --> 00:36:33.980]  At InfoWars, we've already been way ahead of it.
[00:36:34.059 --> 00:36:34.760]  You've been way ahead of it.
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:38.500]  But now we've got to get the general public ahead of it to stop it because it's one of their main agendas.
[00:36:38.719 --> 00:36:46.000]  World War III to stop liberty, new pandemics to bring in tyranny and stop liberty, racial division to stop it as well, economic collapse.
[00:36:46.179 --> 00:36:48.500]  All of this goes together, but we can stop it together.
[00:36:48.619 --> 00:36:52.000]  This is a total fraud and Newsom is a complete criminal.
[00:36:52.239 --> 00:36:53.940]  He is the tip of the spear of their operation.
[00:36:54.539 --> 00:36:55.719]  Again, it's up to you.
[00:36:56.559 --> 00:37:02.699]  The left are using social engineering, psychological warfare systems on the public.
[00:37:03.079 --> 00:37:07.099]  Only by being aware of their larger operations can we stop them.
[00:37:07.519 --> 00:37:14.159]  When people realize that the choice is tyranny and absolute Medical oppression versus liberty.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.000]  It's an easy choice to get informed and say no.
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:27.079]  They're bringing back the mask, the lockdowns, the fake testing, all the hysteria as a system of total social control.
[00:37:27.099 --> 00:37:33.280]  And it's all based on the lie of the supposed bird flu and all this other garbage.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.900]  They were saying a few weeks ago, oh my God, a new hemorrhagic fever, a new Ebola in the Congo.
[00:37:38.699 --> 00:37:41.019]  And the new, quote, Disease X was malaria.
[00:37:41.519 --> 00:37:45.900]  They're liars, they're frauds, and their power has been greatly dissipated.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:52.880]  But the only thing they have in their tool shed is new pandemics, World War III, racial division.
[00:37:54.659 --> 00:38:03.380]  Please get this report out to everyone you know, and let's say no to the rollout of this new mass psychosis, this new mass hysteria.
[00:38:03.519 --> 00:38:11.159]  And let's start moving forward as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to do, as President Trump has pledged to do, prosecuting Big Pharma, prosecuting Fauci.
[00:38:12.759 --> 00:38:24.179]  Prosecuting the heads of the Global EcoHealth Alliance and all the rest of them because they're going to continue to launch these operations, Ted Rose, the head of the WHO and others, until they're brought to justice.
[00:38:24.519 --> 00:38:30.000]  We're not just doing this for all those they killed and maimed with the poison shots and the rest of it.
[00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:33.500]  We're doing it so they can't keep doing it again in the future.
[00:38:33.739 --> 00:38:35.679]  You are under globalist assault.
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:36.380]  Admit it.
[00:38:36.699 --> 00:38:41.900]  Stand up for yourselves and say hell no to your fraud, hell no to your lies from this globalist death cult.
[00:38:42.269 --> 00:38:44.670]  The ball is now in your court, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:46.050]  Now take action.
[00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:48.309]  You are the Paul Revere's, you are the resistance.
[00:38:49.550 --> 00:39:01.230]  It's also critical to understand that the Biden administration wrote the UN pandemic treaty that literally takes over the national sovereignty of any country that signs on to it.
[00:39:01.389 --> 00:39:10.630]  And that now in the continued resolution or the HR, that they are trying to pass this giant bloated spending bill that Trump, Elon Musk and others are opposing.
[00:39:11.679 --> 00:39:24.679]  It actually gives them all these new pandemic powers for forced injections, lockdowns, quarantines, even political dissenters, similar to legislation that New York is trying to put in, as well as California.
[00:39:24.679 --> 00:39:26.400]  So this is real tyranny.
[00:39:26.559 --> 00:39:30.800]  It's being standardized all over the world through the WF and the UN. This is massive.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.579]  So it's the perfect storm right now.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:40.980]  Of the globalist system needing to use viruses as the threat of viruses for their world government plan, just as their own documents show.
[00:39:41.079 --> 00:39:42.920]  So we've got to kill this legislation.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.519]  We've got to call Speaker Johnson.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.980]  We've got to have pressure put on him.
[00:39:47.179 --> 00:39:48.900]  This is a major power grab.
[00:39:49.039 --> 00:39:51.219]  I mean, beyond just bankrupting our economy.
[00:39:51.449 --> 00:39:53.210]  $37 trillion in debt and growing.
[00:39:53.469 --> 00:39:55.010]  This is insane.
[00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.250]  It's posted on Infowars.com.
[00:39:57.409 --> 00:39:58.769]  Grok's done a boil down to the bill.
[00:39:59.409 --> 00:40:02.170]  Rob Dew's on it right now, cutting out the sections, double checking it.
[00:40:02.269 --> 00:40:02.869]  It's all there.
[00:40:02.989 --> 00:40:05.269]  It's so tyrannical, I can't even believe it.
[00:40:05.309 --> 00:40:08.849]  But I guess I do, because the system is desperate and they're making their move.
[00:40:08.969 --> 00:40:11.110]  So get this information out now.
[00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:15.630]  One last key point in the information war.
[00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:21.960]  It is vital That you support outlets like InfoWars and my broadcast.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:40.250]  It is vital that you take these articles and videos and share them on your email list, your text message and repost them everywhere including on still controlled censorship platforms like Facebook because every person we reach is so vital in this fight The system is desperate.
[00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:42.469]  The globalist tyrants are falling apart.
[00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:43.610]  They're badly coordinated.
[00:40:43.869 --> 00:40:48.329]  And they're gonna be very easy to beat if you take action, which I know you are.
[00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:52.889]  Please also support our sponsor to keep us on air, thealexjonesstore.com.

[00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:34.590]  But whatever you do, again, take this report and share it like our collective futures depend on it because they do.
[00:41:35.809 --> 00:41:40.429]  All right, we're now back live in the Infowars World Headquarters here in Austin, Texas.
[00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:42.050]  And we got all kinds of breaking news.
[00:41:42.289 --> 00:41:46.230]  You know, believe it or not, things are actually more chaotic when Alex is on the road.
[00:41:47.509 --> 00:41:52.710]  Because he's sending us things and running the show a lot of times from the road instead of right here in studio.
[00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:57.929]  And as news is breaking, he's sending it to me, he's sending it to the crew, and our heads are spinning here.
[00:41:58.869 --> 00:42:05.650]  So I've got top COVID lawyer exposes spending bill as pandemic power grab framework.
[00:42:05.989 --> 00:42:07.489]  This story just went live.
[00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:09.289]  I've got...
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:20.699]  A story from PBS from back in the summer where they were already awarding vaccine contracts, anticipating there was going to be a pandemic as soon as Trump took office.
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:26.900]  And then you've got this news where they might nominate Elon Musk to be the next Speaker of the House.
[00:42:27.019 --> 00:42:30.920]  So I got all this coming up, but this is why Infowars are so important.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:46.489]  As I'm sitting here in the break, I'm getting messages from top doctors and analysts and everything that are watching the show and tuned in, and they're just sending me more intel, and they're sending me their intel, and they're saying, hey, here's this angle, here's that angle.
[00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:59.489]  So, I mean, this is the mothership of we the people, information distribution, pushing back against the deep state narratives, the fake news media propaganda, and that's why they have to have this place shut down, is because it really is powerful.
[00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:01.949]  It really is.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:22.880]  Now, I'm not going to pontificate on that anymore, but just like the continued resolution failed, if we can stop this next pandemic before it starts, that will be another huge victory for humanity, another huge victory for team freedom in taking our destiny back.
[00:43:23.059 --> 00:43:27.480]  Now, the one fear that I think we could all reasonably have is...
[00:43:29.079 --> 00:43:31.699]  They could just cook up a real deadly virus and release it.
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:44.519]  Not like COVID that was really only deadly if you were extremely unhealthy or had coexisting conditions, but like a hemorrhagenic fever where you're bleeding out of your eyes and your ears and I mean really scare the people.
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:52.800]  It's kind of like whatever that operation they were doing in China with people just passing out, dying on the streets, loading them up into trucks to kind of get that fear mongering going.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.820]  This would be literally people bleeding out of their eyes and their ears.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.179]  But maybe they're not that powerful.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:00.039]  You know, I don't know.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:09.139]  But that'd be the real fear is they're not just running the propaganda and a scamdemic, a plandemic, but they actually do release a deadly deal.
[00:44:09.619 --> 00:44:15.480]  And then they kind of have us in a Boy That Cried Wolf situation and we're like, no, you ran this on us last time.
[00:44:15.599 --> 00:44:17.619]  It really wasn't that deadly for most people.
[00:44:17.739 --> 00:44:19.000]  You killed the people in the hospitals.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.539]  You killed the people with the protocols.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:21.599]  You know what?
[00:44:21.679 --> 00:44:22.400]  We're not falling for it.
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.880]  But then they release a real deadly thing and they say, oh, see?
[00:44:26.769 --> 00:44:28.050]  So these are the crooks we're dealing with.
[00:44:28.489 --> 00:44:34.510]  And that's part of the problem with people like Anthony Fauci and Peter Hotez still running around controlling things.
[00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:36.469]  I mean, Fauci should be behind bars.
[00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:39.889]  But see, they're still out there.
[00:44:39.989 --> 00:44:41.949]  And now they're trying to fund new bio labs.
[00:44:42.369 --> 00:44:44.550]  They put new bio lab funding in this bill.
[00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:47.730]  The general, the Russian general, who's also a scientist...
[00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:53.849]  Who was the first to discover the biolabs in Ukraine that the State Department lied about.
[00:44:53.989 --> 00:44:55.030]  Victoria Nuland lied about.
[00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:55.949]  Then they got caught.
[00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:57.010]  They had to testify under oath.
[00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:58.789]  They were like, okay, yeah, we did have them there.
[00:44:58.869 --> 00:44:59.590]  We were running them, yes.
[00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:05.530]  And then people found the government website that said they were running them.
[00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.269]  And then they removed it from the website.
[00:45:07.429 --> 00:45:09.769]  But you can go back in time on the internet and you can find it.
[00:45:09.849 --> 00:45:10.489]  It was there the whole time.
[00:45:11.769 --> 00:45:12.769]  These are the crooks.
[00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.309]  These are the creeps we're dealing with.
[00:45:16.599 --> 00:45:22.460]  And I don't want to, again, I don't want to get too much into this because we got Grok's analysis of this bill pumped out.
[00:45:22.599 --> 00:45:26.420]  We got Elon Musk, could he be the next Speaker of the House with Marjorie Taylor Greene pushing for this?
[00:45:27.159 --> 00:45:38.539]  But folks, the reason why the Russians were so ticked when they went into these bio labs, and some of this is a mystery because the Russians and the Ukrainians are virtually genetically the same people.
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:49.090]  But you heard about how they were making bio weapons based off of DNA. They went into these labs, the general that they just killed, probably a CIA operation.
[00:45:50.449 --> 00:46:01.510]  They went in and they found they were doing biological weapons so that they could just kill Russians with some sort of a biological agent, DNA-based attack.
[00:46:02.409 --> 00:46:04.349]  So they were real pissed off.
[00:46:04.889 --> 00:46:09.190]  And that general who discovered that, who is a hero in Russia...
[00:46:11.159 --> 00:46:12.599]  See, you don't get this from the Western media.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:19.719]  They just blew him up in a bomb outside of his home.
[00:46:23.079 --> 00:46:24.800]  So these are the crooks we're dealing with.
[00:46:27.219 --> 00:46:29.380]  And they had another pandemic planned.
[00:46:29.699 --> 00:46:30.639]  They were cooking it up.
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.059]  They've been cooking it up.
[00:46:32.739 --> 00:46:39.659]  And they've got everything ready, and they want to blame it on Trump, and they want to shut everything down, and they want to destroy his incoming administration before it even starts.
[00:46:40.059 --> 00:46:41.360]  These are the crooks we're dealing with.
[00:46:41.579 --> 00:46:46.059]  But they tried to shove a continued resolution down our throat, and they failed.
[00:46:48.239 --> 00:46:50.000]  And we stopped them.
[00:46:50.139 --> 00:46:52.000]  And so maybe we can beat them with this, too.
[00:46:53.619 --> 00:46:56.900]  Now, in the break, the new rumor around Trump.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:06.320]  The House, and I've got obviously my congressional sources, things are changing so rapidly now I can't even keep up.
[00:47:06.699 --> 00:47:11.860]  And I've been here hosting the show and getting ready for the show, so I don't have the latest dirt, but it's starting to come in.
[00:47:13.659 --> 00:47:16.840]  You can nominate somebody from outside to be the Speaker of the House.
[00:47:17.679 --> 00:47:19.900]  Elon Musk could be the next Speaker of the House.
[00:47:20.739 --> 00:47:23.400]  And apparently this is what some Republicans are going to be pushing for.
[00:47:23.559 --> 00:47:28.659]  And what I find funny about all this, because he's getting attacked by the Democrats left and right.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:41.139]  Like Democrat Representative Jim McGovern and Becca Balint saying, oh, Musk isn't elected.
[00:47:41.139 --> 00:47:44.019]  Oh, we can't have billionaires influencing politics and all this stuff.
[00:47:44.159 --> 00:47:45.380]  Oh, that's funny.
[00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.690]  That's funny.
[00:47:46.809 --> 00:47:47.929]  You mean like George Soros?
[00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:53.849]  You know, the difference between Elon Musk and George Soros is that Musk stands right up on the front lines.
[00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:57.130]  He doesn't run shadow money campaigns.
[00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:59.449]  He doesn't run shadow campaigns.
[00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:01.809]  He doesn't keep his face out of it, his name out of it.
[00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:05.409]  Elon Musk steps right up to the front and says, Hi, I'm Elon Musk.
[00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:06.889]  I'm funding politics.
[00:48:06.889 --> 00:48:07.750]  Here's my policies.
[00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:08.769]  Here's my...
[00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:10.969]  Here's my agenda.
[00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:18.070]  Where Soros sits back in the shadows and just funds every dark money thing and doesn't want you to know who he is, what he is, what he's doing.
[00:48:19.769 --> 00:48:21.969]  The average person doesn't know who George Soros is.
[00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:23.809]  The average person knows who Elon Musk is.
[00:48:24.329 --> 00:48:25.750]  So that's the difference here.
[00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.829]  But Musk is actually backed by populism.
[00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:34.670]  So Musk actually has the support of the people or he's with the people now.
[00:48:35.639 --> 00:48:43.059]  Soros is the shadowy figure, James Bond villain, that you're not supposed to ever know his name or see him or hear him.
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:49.039]  But no, now they don't like billionaires and big money controlling politics.
[00:48:49.039 --> 00:48:50.659]  This is the left of the party of big money.
[00:48:51.039 --> 00:48:57.599]  This is the Democrat party that has spent billions of dollars on their last three presidential election cycles.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.539]  But now they got a problem with Elon Musk.
[00:49:02.489 --> 00:49:10.150]  Who puts his face out there, steps right out there, goes to Butler, Pennsylvania, where they tried to shoot Trump in the head, and just does it all publicly.
[00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:12.469]  But oh, now they got a problem with it.
[00:49:14.849 --> 00:49:27.309]  And what I've noticed here is, you know, we're so used to Republicans being spineless cowards.
[00:49:28.769 --> 00:49:31.530]  But what I saw yesterday was a major sea change.
[00:49:32.429 --> 00:49:34.309]  And it's nowhere near where we need to be.
[00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:44.269]  But normally, Republicans would just go along and just vote on the bill and just say, let's just put out this fire.
[00:49:44.469 --> 00:49:45.429]  Let's not talk about it.
[00:49:45.469 --> 00:49:46.510]  Let's not make a big thing of it.
[00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:48.230]  Just vote on the bill.
[00:49:48.329 --> 00:49:49.070]  Let's go home for Christmas.
[00:49:50.389 --> 00:49:54.349]  The Democrats are gonna blame us for not funding disaster relief.
[00:49:54.469 --> 00:49:56.530]  The Democrats are gonna blame us for not funding the military.
[00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:59.090]  The Democrats are gonna blame us for not funding the farmers.
[00:49:59.329 --> 00:50:01.130]  The Democrats are gonna blame us for a government shutdown.
[00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.809]  Let's just vote.
[00:50:01.949 --> 00:50:03.010]  Let's just get this thing over with.
[00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:04.730]  It'll pass and let's just get home for Christmas.
[00:50:05.949 --> 00:50:09.869]  That's the normal spineless Republican Party that we're so used to.
[00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:11.829]  That didn't happen yesterday.
[00:50:12.989 --> 00:50:15.070]  The normal tactics did not work.
[00:50:18.579 --> 00:50:21.079]  I guess Elon Musk has some role in that.
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.539]  But this isn't just about Elon Musk.
[00:50:23.659 --> 00:50:24.840]  This is about we the people.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.480]  This is about the mandate that the people gave for President Trump.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:39.329]  This is about the fact that now you're a sitting representative and you're getting a thousand calls a day Let's just look at yesterday.
[00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:47.070]  You're getting a thousand calls, you're getting a thousand emails, and every single one of them says, do not vote for this bill.
[00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:55.610]  So now, if they have political survival instincts, they're saying, oh, I can't support this.
[00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:00.750]  So the whole game has changed.
[00:51:01.469 --> 00:51:03.250]  The entire game has changed.
[00:51:04.789 --> 00:51:06.409]  And we're moving the ball in our direction.
[00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:07.849]  Look, politics is dirty.
[00:51:07.989 --> 00:51:08.289]  It's corrupt.
[00:51:08.429 --> 00:51:08.829]  It's nasty.
[00:51:08.929 --> 00:51:09.610]  We got a deep state.
[00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:11.070]  We got geopolitical problems.
[00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:13.809]  We got foreign influence, special interest groups.
[00:51:13.969 --> 00:51:17.289]  I mean, our system is so broken and corrupt.
[00:51:17.449 --> 00:51:19.449]  It's like, I mean, we are royally screwed.
[00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:26.829]  But we've got our hands on the wheel now and are starting to turn it in our direction.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.420]  So I've got an update on this.
[00:51:34.599 --> 00:51:35.920]  Again, Alex just sent me a thing.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.679]  I don't have it in front of me, guys.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:55.940]  So if you just want to bring that to me whenever you have it, I send it to you on X. We also have Grok's analysis and list potential executive concerning or wasteful spending in this latest bill that was dead on arrival.
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.639]  So we're going to give you all of this.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.400]  Could Elon Musk be the next Speaker of the House?
[00:52:03.539 --> 00:52:07.380]  Boy, look at what Mike Johnson has done, and you just have to wonder why.
[00:52:10.599 --> 00:52:12.480]  Mike Johnson was not very popular.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:31.630]  But then he starts currying favor with Donald Trump and Elon Musk and the incoming administration, and he's flying around on Trump Force One, and he's Going to the UFC fights and the football games and he's photobombing and he's in all the pictures with all the cool kids and you're like,
[00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:36.650]  okay, well, Trump's leveraging the speaker, you know, trying to get him on his side.
[00:52:36.769 --> 00:52:37.329]  All right, whatever.
[00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:47.769]  And then yesterday hits, Johnson is going on television, multiple interviews, pushing this bill, saying it has to be done, it has to be done, breaking his promise.
[00:52:47.769 --> 00:52:49.530]  He said he wouldn't do it, he did do it.
[00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:54.510]  Then lying to the American people, again saying that we have to do it when we don't have to do it.
[00:52:57.469 --> 00:53:02.389]  Wholeheartedly rejected by the American people, wholeheartedly rejected by the Republican representatives.
[00:53:03.449 --> 00:53:06.090]  The only support he had was from Democrats, beautiful.
[00:53:08.329 --> 00:53:09.730]  So why would Johnson do it?
[00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:14.829]  Why would Johnson blatantly lie to the American people multiple times?
[00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:22.869]  Why would he stab in the back politically, turn his back politically on the very people he's been currying favor to for the last two months?
[00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:31.469]  And why would he virtually at this point, I don't know if he would resign, but I don't see how he becomes Speaker of the House again.
[00:53:33.199 --> 00:53:34.679]  Why would he do all this for this bill?
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:39.260]  Why would he sacrifice whatever was left of his public image?
[00:53:39.519 --> 00:53:43.239]  Why would he sacrifice whatever was left of his chances to become speaker again?
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.960]  It's all done.
[00:53:45.199 --> 00:53:48.699]  He sacrificed all of it for this bill.
[00:53:49.099 --> 00:53:50.219]  Why did he do that?
[00:53:50.699 --> 00:53:52.039]  Who told him to do that?
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:57.219]  Corruption, scandal, blackmail, cowardice, all of the above?
[00:53:59.849 --> 00:54:04.829]  So Alex Jones is going to explain why he supports Elon Musk for Speaker of the House.
[00:54:04.969 --> 00:54:08.429]  Marjorie Taylor Greene is leading this movement right now.
[00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:12.409]  And of course, the Democrats are just completely panicked over this.
[00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:13.769]  They don't know what to do now.
[00:54:13.929 --> 00:54:14.809]  They've lost the people.
[00:54:14.949 --> 00:54:15.670]  They've lost everything.
[00:54:15.989 --> 00:54:17.449]  This is a vital transmission.
[00:54:17.449 --> 00:54:19.550]  We are reaching tens of millions of new people a day.
[00:54:19.989 --> 00:54:23.530]  We are one of the most devastating operations of the globalists thanks to your support.
[00:54:25.559 --> 00:54:26.400]  We need to stay on air.
[00:54:26.559 --> 00:54:28.000]  I make it easy for you to do that.
[00:54:28.139 --> 00:54:31.980]  Do your Christmas shopping at thealexjonesstore.com and at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:54:32.159 --> 00:54:37.019]  And I told you, we're not just going to have patriot gear and great supplements that are amazing at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:54:37.739 --> 00:54:40.980]  We're going to have made in America, designer knives, collectibles.
[00:54:41.099 --> 00:54:42.579]  We've already had that, but limited supplies.
[00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:50.429]  There's a huge Black Friday Cyber Week sale going 30 to 40% off on top of the big discounts right now.
[00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:52.349]  Do your Christmas shopping with us.
[00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:55.809]  But some amazing new products just came in.
[00:54:56.809 --> 00:54:58.730]  And when I say amazing, I'm excited.
[00:54:58.949 --> 00:55:00.849]  I know these are going to go quickly.
[00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:07.760]  Unfortunately, This will solve all our problems, but they only made $2,000 in this limited edition.
[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:13.880]  But it'll go a long way towards our lawsuits and funding our operations and the new network and everything else and keeping InfoWars on it.
[00:55:14.019 --> 00:55:14.699]  That continues.
[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:15.699]  Look at this bad boy.
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.559]  The 1984 versus 1776 coin.
[00:55:18.739 --> 00:55:19.360]  I designed it.
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:25.780]  There's only 2,000 of these bad boys at TheAlexJonesStore.com and they are a fundraiser.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.280]  They are a piece of history.
[00:55:27.579 --> 00:55:29.280]  They are pure silver.
[00:55:29.699 --> 00:55:32.219]  They are minted here in America.
[00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:34.550]  2,000 of these.
[00:55:34.809 --> 00:55:36.969]  I predict these sell out in just a couple days.
[00:55:37.369 --> 00:55:41.369]  This is a great Christmas gift, a memento that you stood for the Republic at a critical time.
[00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:42.610]  They are incredible.
[00:55:42.909 --> 00:55:49.389]  Get the 1984 versus 1776 coin at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:56.460]  And the store is not owned by me, so even if the globalists come after us, We're good to go.
[00:55:57.639 --> 00:56:09.539]  We're good to go.
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:14.360]  9.95 and 14.95.
[00:56:14.679 --> 00:56:17.800]  When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.
[00:56:18.059 --> 00:56:19.579]  And on the other side, it's got the Gadsden flag.
[00:56:19.719 --> 00:56:20.420]  Don't tread on me.
[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:22.739]  1776, another one with Alex Jones.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:23.519]  Yours truly on it.
[00:56:23.639 --> 00:56:26.559]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 with the Gadsden flag.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:29.099]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God on the other side.
[00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:34.119]  And there's some other great challenge coins as well at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:36.480]  Now, this is even more exciting.
[00:56:36.699 --> 00:56:37.719]  They surprised me with this.
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:38.820]  I just learned this morning.
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:45.530]  So it's in the mail from Arkansas where their factory is and Their shipping department and all that, the big lead that owns and runs the AlexJonesStore.com.
[00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:50.670]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump on a Stomp, 1995. Everybody loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:53.750]  This is Trump on a Stomp Christmas figurine.
[00:56:53.869 --> 00:56:55.769]  Oh, my daughter loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:56:55.929 --> 00:56:57.570]  We play with them, do all sorts of stuff.
[00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:59.670]  Catapult them around the house, play with them.
[00:56:59.989 --> 00:57:00.610]  Cats play with them.
[00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:02.869]  We've probably got 15 of those Elf on a Shelf.
[00:57:02.949 --> 00:57:04.349]  Book a little elf village in the backyard.
[00:57:04.349 --> 00:57:05.190]  We have a lot of fun.
[00:57:05.409 --> 00:57:07.030]  She puts Christmas tree lights in these little...
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:09.099]  Little trees we got in the backyard.
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:11.239]  Oh my gosh, I've got to have this.
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:12.059]  And I already called him.
[00:57:12.179 --> 00:57:14.199]  I said, I want 10 set aside for me.
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:15.179]  So that means there's...
[00:57:16.699 --> 00:57:18.579]  1,900 and something of these.
[00:57:18.739 --> 00:57:21.260]  And I'm telling you, this is going to sell out today.
[00:57:21.619 --> 00:57:23.679]  Why they didn't get 20,000 of them, I don't know.
[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:24.960]  All my problems would be solved.
[00:57:25.099 --> 00:57:26.159]  We would have plenty of fun.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:27.920]  This baby is amazing.
[00:57:28.099 --> 00:57:33.280]  Everybody needs to have this original Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:37.179]  Celebrate Christmas with the Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:40.539]  The ultimate conversation starter for your tree or mantel.
[00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:48.610]  Poseable and ready to take on the globalist, this festive figure can be positioned in any stance from bold and defiant to perfectly perched.
[00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:56.769]  Whether you're decking the halls or making a statement, this patriotic decoration will keep the spirit of 1776 alive all season long, right into Trump getting inaugurated next month.
[00:57:56.969 --> 00:57:58.570]  Get your Trump on a stump now!
[00:57:58.809 --> 00:58:06.829]  Ultimate CMOS, Patriot gear, amazing hoodies, Christmas sweaters and more, and fun the second American Revolution worldwide at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:58:16.079 --> 00:58:29.940]  Moments ago, Marjorie Taylor Greene posted a poll on X. Would you support Elon Musk for Speaker of the House?
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:49.260]  Now, I bet you can imagine how that poll is going on X. The House controls policy and appropriations, spending, control the purse, and can cut programs, departments, agencies, as well as make new laws like term limits and pass a balanced budget amendment.
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:52.559]  Doge could become a legislative branch.
[00:58:55.639 --> 00:59:01.280]  You know, let's try to look at this from a political science aspect.
[00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:05.750]  Money controls our politicians.
[00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:10.030]  I'm not breaking any new news here, right?
[00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:13.130]  Money controls our politicians.
[00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:30.670]  Foreign interest groups, special interest groups, some of the most controlling groups in Washington D.C., foreign interest groups, APAC, and then special interest groups, big pharmaceutical money, military weapons contractors.
[00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:41.349]  That's why you look at both sides of the aisle, and there's always support for certain things, certain countries, wars, you name it, because they fund both sides of politics.
[00:59:43.289 --> 00:59:45.570]  You look at the left, and they've got George Soros.
[00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:47.210]  He funds all these political campaigns.
[00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:52.989]  He funds all these local races, district attorneys, house representatives, all this stuff.
[00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:57.829]  So that's how politics works.
[00:59:58.250 --> 00:59:58.730]  And...
[01:00:00.719 --> 01:00:07.760]  Then they, to a certain degree, extend their funding of your campaign to the control of your vote.
[01:00:08.179 --> 01:00:12.340]  Your execution of policy.
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:19.219]  Now, I don't think it's as dirty with Elon Musk, because again, he's leading from the front.
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:20.619]  But it's the same concept.
[01:00:22.179 --> 01:00:27.639]  Elon Musk is pouring money into politics on the Republican side of the aisle.
[01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:37.070]  Elon Musk has started a super PAC, the America PAC, that's already had victories that it can point to in the 2024 election.
[01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:50.969]  So, yeah, now the Republicans are sitting here saying, oh, okay, I can get my campaigns funded by the America super PAC or Elon Musk.
[01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:56.650]  And I can be holding to the values that I mostly agree with.
[01:00:57.210 --> 01:00:58.130]  Populist values.
[01:00:58.710 --> 01:01:00.090]  Pro-America values.
[01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:11.150]  So now, yeah, I mean, yeah, Elon Musk has kind of taken over Congress because your Congress is bought and paid for, and Musk is the richest man in the world.
[01:01:12.269 --> 01:01:13.989]  It's not exactly a good situation.
[01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:15.789]  It's why our government's so corrupt.
[01:01:15.989 --> 01:01:18.230]  But I mean, that's what's going on here.
[01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:22.510]  So now, Musk is basically getting Congress to bend to his will.
[01:01:23.949 --> 01:01:27.110]  Whether you think it's good or bad, that's what's going on.
[01:01:27.789 --> 01:01:32.570]  So, Musk is now going to get support.
[01:01:32.769 --> 01:01:34.010]  Let's see how viral this goes.
[01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:37.510]  Musk is now going to get support to become Speaker of the House.
[01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:40.630]  Anything at this point is better than Johnson.
[01:01:42.579 --> 01:01:43.280]  But why not?
[01:01:45.519 --> 01:01:56.139]  Look, I don't want to sacrifice my values, but at the same time, when you're in a war, you know there's a chance you're going to get hit with a bullet.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:12.190]  So it's like, okay, well, Elon Musk is going to go in there and try to stop all the government spending and Slash the federal government, cut regulations, cut taxes, get rid of the waste, get rid of the fat.
[01:02:12.389 --> 01:02:13.869]  Wow, this is great.
[01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:16.929]  I don't really like big money in politics.
[01:02:17.309 --> 01:02:22.230]  I don't really like people coming in and controlling Congress with money.
[01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:28.550]  Just like I don't really like running into battle and getting hit with a bullet or walking over a landmine.
[01:02:30.449 --> 01:02:32.010]  But I'm in a war here.
[01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:36.610]  And at least right now, I know Musk is on my side.
[01:02:37.849 --> 01:02:46.389]  And quite frankly, I find it refreshing that we're finally getting results and that we're finally getting a populist nationalist movement.
[01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:55.670]  I mean, defeating this continued resolution bill yesterday was a massive victory for the American people and a defeat of big government.
[01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:56.690]  Huge.
[01:02:56.969 --> 01:02:59.070]  And Musk had a huge role in that.
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:02.500]  So yeah, that is a major change.
[01:03:02.639 --> 01:03:08.639]  So there's all kinds of evidence the deep state has been planning this next pandemic attack against Donald Trump.
[01:03:09.679 --> 01:03:23.840]  You had California and likely the next Democrat nominee, Gavin Newsom, declaring a state of emergency dealing with the bird flu the exact same day this continued resolution was supposed to pass.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.360]  I'm telling you, they did not anticipate that bill not passing.
[01:03:28.059 --> 01:03:29.599]  They were betting on that bill passing.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:33.260]  They were betting on the medical tyranny being in that bill and they were betting on it passing.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.239]  They failed.
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:36.760]  That was a major blow to the deep state.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.679]  Major blow.
[01:03:41.079 --> 01:03:56.000]  It was not a coincidence that the same day they're signing state of emergency declarations with the next Democrat nominee Gavin Newsom The same day they were supposed to pass that bill.
[01:03:56.179 --> 01:04:00.119]  The same day they're writing dozens of headlines telling you another pandemic's coming.
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:02.500]  None of that's coincidence.
[01:04:02.739 --> 01:04:03.579]  It's all by design.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:13.159]  Instead of disrupting the Trump administration on his way in his last days of his first term in 2020, this time they're going to bring in the pandemic.
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:15.000]  They're going to disrupt it, destroy it day one.
[01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:21.710]  But they took a major blow yesterday, and now we the people are pushing back against this before it can even get started.
[01:04:22.269 --> 01:04:26.989]  Now, these are psychotic killers that we're dealing with.
[01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:28.809]  So they could release a real virus.
[01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:41.429]  And because we didn't make an example of it the first time made in a lab, nobody went to jail for it being made in a lab, nobody went to jail for pushing the vaccines that have killed a bunch of people, they're still out there running wild.
[01:04:43.969 --> 01:04:45.590]  But there's even more evidence here.
[01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:59.349]  With what the Biden administration has been up to, U.S. government will pay Moderna $176 million to develop an mRNA bird flu pandemic vaccine.
[01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:01.949]  So they've been planning for this.
[01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:06.969]  They've been planning for the bird flu pandemic.
[01:05:07.329 --> 01:05:08.730]  That's their next big deal.
[01:05:08.869 --> 01:05:12.010]  And then they'll say it gets to cows, and then they'll say it gets to cats.
[01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:15.369]  They claim it has a 50% mortality rate.
[01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:25.829]  As they fund all the bio labs, as they fund all the gain-of-function research, and then cover it up and lie about it and then cause pandemics.
[01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:36.989]  And then hit you with a vaccine, which may or may not work, but then gives you the blood clots and the cancer and the paralysis and everything else.
[01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:39.929]  So they've been planning for this.
[01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:55.840]  Here's former CDC director, and this is all coming from the CDC now, Listen to what former CDC director Robert Redfield said about the bird flu months ago.
[01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:57.500]  It's like they knew it was coming.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:58.460]  Listen to this.
[01:05:58.619 --> 01:06:07.619]  I remember you told Chris not long ago that the bird flu could make COVID look like a little pandemic, which was quite alarming.
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:09.420]  I mean, is that really the case?
[01:06:11.449 --> 01:06:22.610]  Yes, Brian, I really do think it's very likely that we will at some time, it's not a question of if, it's more of a question of when, we will have a bird flu pandemic.
[01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:32.949]  And as you mentioned, unfortunately, bird flu has, when it does enter humans, has a significant mortality.
[01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:37.789]  Probably somewhere between 25 and 50% mortality.
[01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:39.710]  So it's gonna be quite complicated.
[01:06:39.949 --> 01:06:48.250]  Once the virus gains the ability to attach to the human receptor and then go human to human, that's when you're gonna have the pandemic.
[01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:51.409]  And as I said, I think it's just a matter of time.
[01:06:52.769 --> 01:06:54.429]  It's just a matter of time.
[01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:59.050]  It's a matter of when, not if, when it can attach to the human receptor.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.320]  Oh, they're researching it right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.739]  In their dastardly little labs.
[01:07:08.679 --> 01:07:22.500]  They're researching right now, gain of function probably, attaching to human receptors, bird flu, H5N1, just like they were doing with COVID. The same research.
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:28.500]  And then they just claim, their argument is...
[01:07:29.389 --> 01:07:30.869]  And this was in the last bill.
[01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:32.289]  This was in the continued resolution.
[01:07:33.489 --> 01:07:36.210]  We're doing this as a proactive measure.
[01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:40.789]  Oh yeah, we're doing gain-of-function research.
[01:07:40.949 --> 01:07:47.969]  Then it's like, oh well, we are doing gain-of-function research, but that's just as a proactive measure so that, you know, we can have a vaccine ready.
[01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:52.190]  Which is actually a strange admission because most people don't understand this.
[01:07:52.329 --> 01:07:57.340]  When they go get the flu vaccine, This couldn't apply to anything else.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.719]  This is how corrupt Big Pharma is.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:06.159]  If you go to the grocery store, can they sell you a gallon of expired milk?
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:19.079]  If you go to the grocery store and you look at a gallon of milk and the expiration date was last month or last year, are you going to buy that milk?
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.159]  Can they legally sell you expired milk?
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:30.859]  What if the milk is a year expired and they cross out the expiration date and just write a new date on it?
[01:08:31.039 --> 01:08:31.800]  Would that be legal?
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:33.079]  Of course not.
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:34.319]  You can't do that.
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:37.880]  But with vaccines, green light.
[01:08:39.539 --> 01:08:48.500]  When you get a flu vaccine, which I hope you don't, but when you go get a flu vaccine, it's already expired.
[01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:52.789]  This is why they do the gain of function research.
[01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:54.789]  It's virus roulette.
[01:08:55.970 --> 01:09:09.310]  When you put that injection into your arm, the flu vaccine, it's for a flu that has already mutated, already evolved, and that vaccine is expired.
[01:09:09.909 --> 01:09:16.010]  So you're getting a flu shot for a flu virus from last year.
[01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:19.189]  It's not even doing anything.
[01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:21.250]  It doesn't give you any immunity.
[01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:24.250]  The flu has already mutated.
[01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:27.670]  The vaccine you're getting is for an older version of the flu.
[01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:30.869]  It is an expired vaccine, and they give it to you.
[01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:33.390]  But this is their mind.
[01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:34.430]  This is their concept.
[01:09:34.810 --> 01:09:46.329]  So then they take things like COVID, bird flu, probably dengue fever, and all these different things out there, and they put it in a lab.
[01:09:47.649 --> 01:09:48.789]  And they mutate it.
[01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:53.010]  And they mutate it a hundred times.
[01:09:53.010 --> 01:09:54.569]  It's called gain-of-function research.
[01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:55.890]  And they make it more powerful.
[01:09:55.890 --> 01:09:57.609]  And they mutate it a hundred different rays.
[01:09:57.810 --> 01:10:01.970]  And they say, okay, let's just take a guess.
[01:10:03.289 --> 01:10:05.770]  This is going to be the mutation it takes in nature.
[01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:08.930]  And of course, it's basically a zero percent chance that they ever get it right.
[01:10:09.109 --> 01:10:09.989]  It's virtually impossible.
[01:10:11.289 --> 01:10:15.909]  To think that they're gonna mutate it perfectly in a lab the same way it would mutate in nature.
[01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:27.010]  So these psychotic freaks, at the least, if not mass murdering criminals, these psychotic freaks Take viruses into a lab.
[01:10:27.250 --> 01:10:34.449]  This is what their 12 grants, they had 12 new bio labs they were going to fund with this continued resolution that failed yesterday.
[01:10:34.609 --> 01:10:35.550]  12 new bio labs.
[01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:43.449]  And they take viruses into a lab, they do the gain of function research, they manipulate and evolve them, and then they guess.
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:47.800]  And they say, we think this is going to be the mutation it takes in nature.
[01:10:47.899 --> 01:10:49.720]  We'll put out a vaccine for this one.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.479]  And they have a virtually 0% chance of getting it right.
[01:10:53.619 --> 01:10:57.359]  And then they force you to take a vaccine that will have no effect at all.
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:05.859]  Now, of course, they've had vaccines that are effective with polio and other such things, but they rigged those up too.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.140]  Just ask the people in Africa.
[01:11:11.739 --> 01:11:20.460]  But that's all part of the eugenics programs that they run, like Bill Gates and Margaret Sanger and others, that just, I guess, want black people dead.
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:20.920]  I don't know.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.119]  Margaret Sanger was really into that.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.739]  You can go look her up.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:26.340]  You know, your loving founder of Planned Parenthood and abortion.
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:32.380]  So, now they have labs doing the same thing with bird flu.
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:38.840]  And he says, well, if it can ever communicate with the human receptor, well, golly gee!
[01:11:40.739 --> 01:11:42.680]  What do you think they're doing in these labs, folks?
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:48.880]  How do you think they take a bat virus and make it communicable to humans?
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:51.720]  It's called lab research.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:55.279]  And now they're doing the same thing with the bird flu.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.079]  But they say, this is just a proactive measure.
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.800]  We have to do this so we can make a vaccine.
[01:12:04.569 --> 01:12:08.510]  In case organically and nature it's able to do it and now we've got the vaccine.
[01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:10.970]  So no, they make the viruses in the lab.
[01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:20.890]  They cook the viruses up in the lab and then they leak or get released intentionally and now it's out there.
[01:12:21.109 --> 01:12:23.609]  And now it's loose.
[01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:25.149]  Now it's free.
[01:12:26.289 --> 01:12:37.279]  But don't worry, they've got the vaccine ready to go and they've got all the legislation to force you to take it And if you don't, you don't get any freedoms.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.300]  These are the sick freaks that run our government.
[01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:50.159]  And I'm supposed to sit here and be upset because Elon Musk wants to get involved?
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:57.800]  The same people that have done the most dastardest deeds ever to this country?
[01:12:59.770 --> 01:13:00.970]  Like Anthony Fauci?
[01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:04.829]  That is a diabolical man.
[01:13:06.670 --> 01:13:07.590]  Oh yeah.
[01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:13.729]  How do you think Fauci feels about Elon Musk posting on X that Fauci needs to be prosecuted?
[01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:18.670]  How do you think Fauci feels about RFK Jr. in the incoming administration?
[01:13:19.109 --> 01:13:24.869]  RFK Jr. literally wrote the book about Anthony Fauci's diabolical activities.
[01:13:28.609 --> 01:13:34.130]  Yeah, it's about time the real demons that walk among us, like Anthony Fauci, start to sweat a little bit.
[01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:39.069]  Not you because you want to go to the grocery store without a mask on.
[01:13:40.069 --> 01:13:44.890]  Not you because you want to be able to go to work without taking an experimental injection.
[01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:50.710]  No, not you sweating because of some government tyranny, some medical tyranny.
[01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:52.789]  Them that make viruses in a lab.
[01:13:52.949 --> 01:13:55.489]  Them that force you to take an experimental injection.
[01:13:55.949 --> 01:13:59.909]  Them that force you to wear a damn mask on your face so you can't even fucking breathe.
[01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:01.270]  Those freaks!
[01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:03.050]  Maybe they need to sweat a little bit.
[01:14:05.949 --> 01:14:08.590]  Oh yeah, how do you think they feel about Elon Musk?
[01:14:08.649 --> 01:14:14.710]  How do you think they feel about RFK Jr. getting into this next administration and having a role in politics?
[01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:16.130]  Oh, they're sweating it for sure.
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:21.279]  Some people think Pelosi, she had a hip injury in Europe.
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:23.180]  I don't think she's traveled back.
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:24.180]  She's going to have to have surgery.
[01:14:24.539 --> 01:14:28.560]  Some people think she's on the lam.
[01:14:29.539 --> 01:14:35.779]  Some people think she's afraid to come back because maybe it has something to do with that healthcare CEO killing.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.819]  Maybe it has something to do with Biden now.
[01:14:41.039 --> 01:14:43.300]  Biden has been in Congress.
[01:14:43.319 --> 01:14:45.859]  He's been in Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
[01:14:46.770 --> 01:14:50.329]  And now he comes out and he wants to ban stock trading from Congress.
[01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:52.609]  Well, you've been here how long now you want to do it?
[01:14:53.069 --> 01:14:54.489]  Folks, why do you think he's doing that?
[01:14:57.369 --> 01:14:59.170]  It's to get even with Nancy Pelosi.
[01:15:01.289 --> 01:15:02.229]  That's all it is.
[01:15:04.729 --> 01:15:09.270]  Pelosi's family has made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:15:09.789 --> 01:15:13.229]  It's, everybody knows it.
[01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:16.970]  Biden calls for ban on congressional stock trading.
[01:15:17.529 --> 01:15:20.470]  Biden finally breaks silence on congressional stock trading.
[01:15:20.670 --> 01:15:22.989]  I don't know how you can look your constituents in the eye.
[01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:25.130]  Good point.
[01:15:25.789 --> 01:15:27.189]  And look at Newsweek.
[01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:31.970]  Look at the Newsweek headline because everybody knows Nancy Pelosi with the insider trading.
[01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:44.850]  I think the only person that does better than Nancy Pelosi is Dan Crenshaw, who isn't very popular either, who went on Lunatic diatribes last night, by the way.
[01:15:45.829 --> 01:15:48.810]  He's had a complete psychotic break, Dan Crenshaw.
[01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:55.350]  Newsweek headline, how Nancy Pelosi would be impacted by congressional stock trading ban.
[01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:56.909]  Everybody knows it.
[01:15:57.010 --> 01:16:02.590]  It's like the big open secret that Pelosi and her husband make hundreds of millions of dollars on stock trades.
[01:16:03.739 --> 01:16:04.880]  They have apps.
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:08.779]  Again, the only person that might do better than Pelosi is Crenshaw, so you might want to ask him what he knows.
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:10.279]  They have apps.
[01:16:10.359 --> 01:16:12.180]  It's like automatic trading apps.
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.319]  It's crazy.
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:34.029]  I mean, if I didn't have any ethics, I would do it, but I'm not some greedy, grubby, money-hungry person, but they have automatic trading apps where you can basically just put money in, And this app will automatically do whatever trades Pelosi does.
[01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:36.569]  And it's like 98% success rate.
[01:16:40.289 --> 01:16:41.569]  Everybody knows it.
[01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:46.409]  They do whole reports about congressional stock trades.
[01:16:46.529 --> 01:16:48.130]  They all make millions of dollars.
[01:16:49.069 --> 01:16:50.489]  How do they do it?
[01:16:51.329 --> 01:16:53.670]  What does Nancy Pelosi know?
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:59.960]  So yeah, Joe Biden talking about banning congressional trading, that's a direct shot to Nancy Pelosi.
[01:17:00.159 --> 01:17:01.199]  Everybody knows it.
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:04.899]  A big open secret about the Pelosi's making hundreds of millions of dollars on stock trades.
[01:17:08.039 --> 01:17:10.079]  Just a big open secret of corruption.
[01:17:10.239 --> 01:17:13.539]  So Biden, Pelosi runs the coup on Biden.
[01:17:13.739 --> 01:17:16.960]  She was part of the coup to remove Joe Biden.
[01:17:17.119 --> 01:17:23.140]  So Joe Biden, in a final blow to the Democrats that couped him, installs Kamala, who is a total loser.
[01:17:24.659 --> 01:17:29.699]  And then says maybe we should have bills banning stock trading in Congress as a big fat middle finger to Nancy Pelosi.
[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:37.260]  By the way, speaking of Kamala Harris, the Democrats are trying to buy her out of politics for good right now.
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.539]  This is what a disaster she is.
[01:17:41.659 --> 01:17:49.680]  If you've ever had any doubt about how phony Democrat Party politics are, and you kind of feel bad for the people that believe it, they are truly the dumbest among us.
[01:17:50.939 --> 01:17:52.199]  That they can't see this.
[01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:56.750]  Surely you saw the headlines.
[01:17:56.890 --> 01:18:00.810]  Kamala Harris campaign, $20 million in debt.
[01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:09.670]  They spent a billion dollars and then they owed some vendors and I think some performers a couple million bucks, $20 million in debt, the Harris campaign.
[01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:12.189]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, they have the Democrat Party.
[01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:16.649]  They could go to the urinal and leak out $20 million.
[01:18:17.369 --> 01:18:20.130]  They just spent over a billion dollars on this last campaign.
[01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:22.630]  They spent hundreds of millions of dollars on house seats.
[01:18:23.770 --> 01:18:25.229]  $20 million for the Democrats?
[01:18:26.050 --> 01:18:26.529]  Please.
[01:18:27.810 --> 01:18:30.270]  And they act like, oh my gosh, she's $20 million in debt.
[01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:36.989]  Folks, if the Democrats wanted to keep Kamala Harris around, they could easily pay that debt.
[01:18:37.390 --> 01:18:42.390]  She's got lawsuits coming against her, her campaign, because they can't pay staff.
[01:18:43.630 --> 01:18:49.109]  The Democrats could easily pay the $20 million Kamala Harris campaign debt overnight.
[01:18:49.369 --> 01:18:50.710]  They don't want to.
[01:18:50.989 --> 01:18:55.050]  They don't want Harris anywhere near Democrat Party politics ever again.
[01:18:55.770 --> 01:18:57.069]  That's how bad she was.
[01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:59.350]  Probably the worst presidential candidate of all time.
[01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:02.350]  Cringe factor of 100. They want her out.
[01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:03.270]  They want her removed.
[01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:06.770]  But she's kind of an arrogant bitch herself, so she really doesn't want to go anywhere.
[01:19:06.989 --> 01:19:08.569]  It's kind of a trend with Democrat women.
[01:19:08.689 --> 01:19:10.130]  It's like Hillary Clinton won't go away either.
[01:19:11.409 --> 01:19:12.789]  So Harris doesn't want to go again.
[01:19:12.989 --> 01:19:14.029]  Or she doesn't want to go away.
[01:19:14.109 --> 01:19:14.890]  She wants to go again.
[01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:17.390]  But the Democrats are saying, no, you're $20 million in debt.
[01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:18.069]  We're not paying it.
[01:19:18.189 --> 01:19:18.770]  Get the hell out.
[01:19:18.869 --> 01:19:23.250]  So now they're basically bribing her, is what I look at this as.
[01:19:23.869 --> 01:19:29.090]  Kamala Harris set to receive a whopping $20 million from book publishers...
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:34.520]  For a chance to peek into the skeletons in the Biden White House.
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:37.640]  Oh, a $20 million book deal.
[01:19:37.819 --> 01:19:40.899]  The exact same number she was in debt.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.199]  Oh, yes.
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:45.000]  I'm sure that's just a coincidence.
[01:19:45.399 --> 01:19:45.560]  No.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:55.939]  Everybody knows about the book deals and tell a lot of the corrupt members of Congress and members of media get paid off is through book deals.
[01:19:57.609 --> 01:19:58.909]  Oh, I'm sure it's just a coincidence.
[01:19:58.909 --> 01:20:04.149]  The exact number her campaign is in debt is the exact number they're offering her on a book deal.
[01:20:04.409 --> 01:20:05.810]  Oh, it's just a coincidence.
[01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:07.630]  Folks, they're trying to buy her out.
[01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:08.789]  They want her gone.
[01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:14.750]  They want Kamala Harris out of the Democrat Party, out of running for office, gone for good.
[01:20:15.829 --> 01:20:19.569]  I don't think she's going to go away silently, but that's what this is.
[01:20:19.630 --> 01:20:21.130]  This is them trying to buy her out.
[01:20:26.729 --> 01:20:27.329]  Alright.
[01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:33.649]  By the way, they're trying to run the same gambit on the American people.
[01:20:33.789 --> 01:20:34.390]  It's not working.
[01:20:37.229 --> 01:20:39.550]  Democrat Senator Mark Warner.
[01:20:39.789 --> 01:20:49.090]  Hard to imagine anything more heartless than shutting down the government and leaving disaster victims out in the cold just days before Christmas.
[01:20:49.449 --> 01:20:50.750]  Absolutely outrageous.
[01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:52.329]  This is even a possibility.
[01:20:52.529 --> 01:20:53.250]  Well, it's not, Warner.
[01:20:54.010 --> 01:20:56.510]  You guys could have a single issue bill on disaster relief.
[01:20:56.670 --> 01:20:58.890]  You could have a single issue bill on farmers.
[01:20:58.989 --> 01:20:59.689]  You could.
[01:20:59.869 --> 01:21:03.970]  You don't need a 1,500 page plus bill with all your pork in it.
[01:21:04.069 --> 01:21:05.010]  You could have a single issue bill.
[01:21:05.170 --> 01:21:05.729]  You don't do it.
[01:21:05.869 --> 01:21:12.970]  And then you sick bastards say, oh, we can't give money to the disaster relief because you won't pass the pork bill.
[01:21:14.210 --> 01:21:15.649]  No one's falling for it.
[01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:28.420]  By the way, the same people that give hundreds, hundreds of millions, It's actually billions to non-citizens, illegal immigrants.
[01:21:29.659 --> 01:21:30.859]  But ah, yes.
[01:21:31.539 --> 01:21:34.159]  Speaking of the illegal immigrants, here's Nancy Pelosi.
[01:21:34.359 --> 01:21:36.380]  She put her staff to task.
[01:21:36.579 --> 01:21:38.739]  Excuse me, Nancy Mace, not Nancy Pelosi.
[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.119]  Here's Nancy Mace.
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:44.640]  She put her staff to task.
[01:21:45.949 --> 01:21:56.369]  To look into the criminal aliens that were brought in by the Democrats, committed violent crimes, and then released back onto the streets by the Democrats, what she found was shocking.
[01:21:56.630 --> 01:21:58.449]  Look at this in clip six.
[01:21:59.890 --> 01:22:02.350]  I just got something from ICE that I haven't shared with you.
[01:22:03.789 --> 01:22:04.689]  What's what we're talking about?
[01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:13.869]  ICE? ICE. Yeah, so we just got this spreadsheet of every criminal alien that Kristen Graziano released.
[01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:15.670]  Oh my gosh, slow down, let's see.
[01:22:15.789 --> 01:22:17.770]  Yeah, so this is the country of citizenship.
[01:22:18.449 --> 01:22:18.789]  This is...
[01:22:18.789 --> 01:22:19.390]  Oh my gosh.
[01:22:19.529 --> 01:22:20.689]  This is part of our...
[01:22:20.689 --> 01:22:21.609]  This was a part of our request.
[01:22:21.609 --> 01:22:22.510]  Our document request?
[01:22:22.649 --> 01:22:24.210]  These are the crimes that they committed.
[01:22:24.409 --> 01:22:25.310]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[01:22:25.670 --> 01:22:28.270]  We have domestic violence beating up women.
[01:22:28.979 --> 01:22:29.500]  I said, no.
[01:22:29.979 --> 01:22:32.039]  We have cocaine possession.
[01:22:32.039 --> 01:22:33.500]  You wanna get high and you're illegal.
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:34.119]  You're not.
[01:22:34.319 --> 01:22:35.239]  No, that's not happening.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.560]  A lot of assault, burglary.
[01:22:38.239 --> 01:22:39.300]  OMG. Hang on.
[01:22:39.659 --> 01:22:41.000]  That wasn't the August one.
[01:22:41.159 --> 01:22:41.420]  Okay.
[01:22:41.939 --> 01:22:42.979]  Are these different people?
[01:22:43.159 --> 01:22:44.579]  Are these the same person?
[01:22:44.699 --> 01:22:45.859]  This could be the same person.
[01:22:46.079 --> 01:22:46.199]  Okay.
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:47.140]  So.
[01:22:47.689 --> 01:22:50.090]  You know who else she let out on the streets of Charleston?
[01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:50.789]  Guys?
[01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:53.649]  Sexual exploitation of a minor.
[01:22:53.829 --> 01:22:55.149]  That is some sick shit.
[01:22:55.489 --> 01:22:58.569]  That is our former sanctuary sheriff.
[01:22:58.850 --> 01:22:59.590]  I just can't even.
[01:22:59.710 --> 01:23:03.489]  She was letting pedophiles, alleged pedophiles, out on the street.
[01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:04.250]  That's pretty gross.
[01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:05.350]  Homicide?
[01:23:05.829 --> 01:23:10.909]  She let a murderer back out into the streets of Charleston.
[01:23:10.989 --> 01:23:13.989]  A guy who was here illegally and murdered someone.
[01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:14.850]  Rapists?
[01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:15.869]  Are you effing?
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:19.340]  Kidding, she let rapists back, she let rapists.
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.159]  I'm gonna throw up, this is disgusting.
[01:23:21.439 --> 01:23:24.060]  Yeah, drug, what do you do, drug manufacturers?
[01:23:24.319 --> 01:23:26.680]  Not like, you know, some Tylenol.
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:30.920]  We're talking about meth, methamphetamine, drug traffickers.
[01:23:31.239 --> 01:23:34.159]  I wonder if that was a cartel member, Graziano.
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:39.020]  A lot of domestic violence, a lot of rape and sex offenses, domestic violence.
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:43.119]  Holy cow, my gosh, there is so many- vehicular manslaughter.
[01:23:43.529 --> 01:23:47.829]  Criminal domestic violence people on here and rapists.
[01:23:48.489 --> 01:23:53.670]  Someone who is committing voyeurism, someone who is filming people naked without their knowledge or consent.
[01:23:54.090 --> 01:23:59.529]  Guys that were drinking under the influence and on the streets, on the roads, who could have killed somebody.
[01:23:59.630 --> 01:24:02.149]  In fact, some of these people on this list actually did kill people.
[01:24:03.019 --> 01:24:03.579]  Murderers.
[01:24:03.659 --> 01:24:04.819]  That is disgusting.
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:06.699]  How many cases?
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:08.520]  So these aren't all people.
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:10.520]  These are just the criminal charges.
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:16.659]  Okay, so a total of almost a hundred people who are here illegally.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:24.939]  Criminals that were raping women, raping kids, pedophiles, murderers, guys that were beating up their partners or wives.
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:33.760]  You were here illegally from Brazil, the Bahamas, Colombia, Cuba, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Venezuela.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:37.979]  Thank God she doesn't have any reign of power.
[01:24:37.979 --> 01:24:47.340]  So this is just in Charleston, South Carolina, where they're releasing rapists and killers onto the streets, pedophiles onto the streets, just your loving Democrats.
[01:24:48.659 --> 01:24:56.319]  When we come back, we're going to look at An analysis of all the excessive wasteful spending in this bill that's failed.
[01:24:56.619 --> 01:24:58.600]  But you know, we haven't even mentioned this today.
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.720]  It kind of gets lost in the sauce.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:09.939]  Georgia appeals court disqualifies Fannie Willis and her team from Trump election interference case.
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:17.439]  Well, keep in mind, they lied and said they didn't have any contact with the White House.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.939]  And then it turned out, I mean, of course, there's White House record.
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:24.680]  And then Nathan Wade had to admit that, yes, they did have communication with the White House.
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:33.479]  So, Fannie Willis and the Georgia case, now also dead in the water.
[01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:37.329]  Democrats are losing left and right.
[01:25:37.489 --> 01:25:39.949]  The deep state taking big losses.
[01:25:40.409 --> 01:25:46.229]  Two new incredible products just came in to the warehouse in Arkansas and they are top of the line.

[01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:41.640]  You heard it here first.
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.979]  We told you last week, Trudeau's set to resign.
[01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:45.520]  Now it's all over the news.
[01:27:45.739 --> 01:27:48.420]  And Keir Starmer just canceled the elections in England.
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:52.220]  They're both top WEF globalist puppets.
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:28:01.920]  They're both poster boys for Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the UN. And they're going down in flames as the global awakening, the great awakening, accelerates.
[01:28:14.949 --> 01:28:25.270]  As you know, the WF slash UN BlackRock Crime Syndicate's been very public about the fact that they've penetrated the cabinet and taken over half of the Western governments.
[01:28:25.810 --> 01:28:50.739]  But because of this broadcast and others exposing it, because of you exposing it, the world is waking up to these tyrants whose official policy Is to have massive carbon taxes, global vaccine passports, and total control to make you absolutely poor so they can dictate every facet of your life and dictate the terms of our collective surrender to their transhumanist death cult.
[01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:58.840]  Now, we've seen Klaus Schwab say that Trudeau of Canada is the model of their world government.
[01:28:59.449 --> 01:29:07.390]  What we are very proud of now is the young generation, like Prime Minister Trudeau, that we penetrate the cabinets.
[01:29:07.850 --> 01:29:21.489]  And I know that half of this cabinet, or even more half of this cabinet, are actually young global leaders of the world.
[01:29:22.329 --> 01:29:28.630]  And he is incredibly unpopular, but via parliamentary manipulation has been able to stay in power.
[01:29:28.890 --> 01:29:31.569]  He has less than a 20% approval rating, so does his party.
[01:29:32.090 --> 01:29:52.880]  But now, in the last few days, as we predicted last week, The deputy head of his party and others have come out and said that he needs to resign or in the new year they're going to have a no-confidence vote and remove him because he is destroying their party and their other coalition parties because of the agenda of shutting off the economy and creating inflation at the same time,
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:58.000]  which is the WEF plan to again have the Great Reset.
[01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:01.680]  Right now, Canadians are struggling with the cost of living.
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:03.060]  I hear it everywhere I go.
[01:30:03.159 --> 01:30:05.659]  People cannot find a home that they can afford.
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:07.279]  They can't buy their groceries.
[01:30:07.479 --> 01:30:16.340]  And on top of that, we have Trump threatening tariffs at 25%, which put hundreds and thousands of Canadian jobs at risk.
[01:30:17.130 --> 01:30:21.649]  And instead of focusing on these issues, Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are focused on themselves.
[01:30:21.949 --> 01:30:24.289]  They're fighting themselves instead of fighting for Canadians.
[01:30:24.529 --> 01:30:28.029]  And for that reason today, I'm calling on Justin Trudeau to resign.
[01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:29.109]  He has to go.
[01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:32.810]  Will you declare no confidence in the Liberal government as soon as possible?
[01:30:33.149 --> 01:30:36.489]  All tools, all options are on the table.
[01:30:36.909 --> 01:30:40.989]  People are hurting, people are struggling, and so all options are on the table.
[01:30:41.890 --> 01:30:47.229]  Just to clarify, you're calling for him to resign, but you are not willing to vote no confidence in his government?
[01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:49.609]  How do those two things connect?
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:51.420]  All options are on the table.
[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:52.779]  All options.
[01:30:53.899 --> 01:30:56.659]  What does this mean for your support with the liberals, though?
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:31:00.880]  How can you say he needs to resign, but then you're not telling us what you're gonna do for non-confidence?
[01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:02.880]  Telling you that all options are on the table.
[01:31:04.539 --> 01:31:06.600]  Will you support the Fez?
[01:31:06.699 --> 01:31:11.479]  And also, are you willing to continue to support the liberals if there is a different leader aside from Trudeau?
[01:31:11.979 --> 01:31:13.180]  Right now, that's not in front of us.
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:15.560]  There's no votes in front of us, but we will take each vote.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:17.340]  And right now, literally, everything's on the table.
[01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:20.670]  So this is really, really great news.
[01:31:20.829 --> 01:31:27.069]  We also now have Keir Starmer, the incredibly unpopular British Prime Minister, canceling the future election.
[01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:29.729]  Oh, like Zelensky's done in Ukraine.
[01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:31.310]  This is tyranny.
[01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:38.510]  This is totalitarianism because he has less than a 15% approval rating and his party less than a 20. It's like an 18 right now.
[01:31:39.069 --> 01:31:40.149]  Think about that.
[01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:45.750]  So this is very exciting, and it's happening all over the world right now.
[01:31:45.949 --> 01:32:01.869]  So here's some clips of what's coming out right now, and I'll come back and give you the rest of the story, but humanity's on the march, but that's what makes the globalists so dangerous, and why they wanna use a new pandemic and new state of medical emergency, which is now being rolled out, and World War III as the political distraction,
[01:32:02.109 --> 01:32:03.789]  because if they don't, they're done.
[01:32:03.949 --> 01:32:04.909]  It's over for them.
[01:32:05.890 --> 01:32:10.050]  The last pandemic blew up in their face, and that's the main thing that's accelerated their collapse.
[01:32:10.250 --> 01:32:12.090]  We'll lay it all out straight ahead.
[01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:14.989]  Now, it shouldn't be that way.
[01:32:15.109 --> 01:32:16.609]  It wasn't supposed to be that way.
[01:32:16.789 --> 01:32:22.609]  We were supposed to be on a steady, if difficult sometimes, march towards progress.
[01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:31.930]  And yet, just a few weeks ago, the United States voted for a second time to not elect its first woman president.
[01:32:33.009 --> 01:32:39.770]  Everywhere, women's rights and women's progress is under attack, overtly and subtly.
[01:32:40.050 --> 01:32:44.890]  I want you to know that I am and always will be a proud feminist.
[01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:48.390]  You will always have an ally in me and in my government.
[01:32:48.779 --> 01:32:51.000]  You've sold us out to globalism.
[01:32:51.199 --> 01:32:53.399]  You are not working for Canada.
[01:32:53.819 --> 01:32:56.899]  You are working for your globalist partners.
[01:32:56.899 --> 01:33:00.340]  I wonder how much they're paying you to betray Canada.
[01:33:00.579 --> 01:33:03.760]  What do we do with traitors in Canada, Mr. Trudeau?
[01:33:03.899 --> 01:33:05.039]  We used to hang them.
[01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:06.779]  Hang them for treason.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.500]  And you're doing that very same thing to us now.
[01:33:11.229 --> 01:33:14.789]  Departure is so important a lie.
[01:33:15.369 --> 01:33:23.369]  Minister of Finances, Vice First Minister, Prime Minister, is the end of this government.
[01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:46.479]  And that at the latest in the beginning of 2025, the Prime Minister should go to the General Governor and ask for the dissolution of the Parliament in order for Quebecers and Canadians to compose a new Parliament that will have the mandate to deal with the real crisis at hand,
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:53.819]  which is the most important crisis in terms of diplomacy and trade between Canada and United States in recent history.
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:58.380]  Somebody needs a mandate and it goes through a new Parliament.
[01:33:58.859 --> 01:34:01.180]  King Trudeau, what gives you the right to continue?
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:03.359]  What gives you the right to stay in office?
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:05.300]  You failed Canada.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:06.859]  You've ruined our country.
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:08.020]  You're done.
[01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:09.020]  Walk away.
[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:11.100]  You don't have an ounce of your father's integrity.
[01:34:11.279 --> 01:34:12.479]  At least he walked in the snow.
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:14.960]  You've ruined this country.
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:17.500]  Everyone around you is running from you.
[01:34:17.699 --> 01:34:18.600]  They're abandoning you.
[01:34:18.699 --> 01:34:21.020]  Chrystia Freeland, Sean Frazier, they've all left you.
[01:34:21.239 --> 01:34:22.439]  It's time for you to go.
[01:34:22.659 --> 01:34:24.479]  It's time for Canada to have an election.
[01:34:24.819 --> 01:34:25.920]  You're not the king.
[01:34:27.029 --> 01:34:29.970]  Yeah, but you said there's gonna be confidence votes in February and in March.
[01:34:30.130 --> 01:34:43.810]  Does that mean if Justin Trudeau is still the prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party in February and March, does all options on the table mean the NDP will vote no, vote non-confidence in the government in those two months on that timeline?
[01:34:43.970 --> 01:34:56.350]  If we're talking the end of February and the beginning of March and Mr. Trudeau has not stepped down, hasn't he did that call from his own caucus, from his own cabinet, from all the opposition parties, then yes.
[01:34:56.350 --> 01:35:04.350]  So of course that would mean if we're coming up to a straight up non-confidence motion the end of February, early March, that's one of the tools that we have.
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.399]  So there's no doubt about that.
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:08.520]  Jagmeet Singh was very, very clear.
[01:35:08.779 --> 01:35:13.979]  My concern really, David, isn't just late February, early March.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:14.939]  It's right now.
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:17.119]  People need the social supports.
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:21.020]  We need a government that actually is functional and is putting those supports into place.
[01:35:21.199 --> 01:35:27.220]  And we need all hands on deck in terms of the Trump tariffs, which threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs.
[01:35:27.579 --> 01:35:33.159]  So this idea that the Liberals can play out a drama over the course of the next few months, simply not on.
[01:35:33.529 --> 01:35:36.789]  And the NDP, I think Jagmeet Singh was very clear about that.
[01:35:36.909 --> 01:35:41.149]  There's a level of admiration I actually have for China.
[01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:54.909]  Because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say, we need to go green as fast as we need to start investing in solar.
[01:35:55.409 --> 01:36:03.750]  I mean, there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about of having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted that I find quite interesting.
[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:07.659]  Right now, Canadians are struggling with the cost of living.
[01:36:07.859 --> 01:36:09.039]  I hear it everywhere I go.
[01:36:09.159 --> 01:36:11.640]  People cannot find a home that they can afford.
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.260]  They can't buy their groceries.
[01:36:13.479 --> 01:36:22.319]  And on top of that, we have Trump threatening tariffs of 25%, which put hundreds and thousands of Canadian jobs at risk.
[01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:27.649]  And instead of focusing on these issues, Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are focused on themselves.
[01:36:27.930 --> 01:36:30.250]  They're fighting themselves instead of fighting for Canadians.
[01:36:30.529 --> 01:36:34.029]  And for that reason today, I'm calling on Justin Trudeau to resign.
[01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:35.090]  He has to go.
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:38.800]  Will you declare no confidence in the Liberal government as soon as possible?
[01:36:39.159 --> 01:36:42.500]  All tools, all options are on the table.
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:47.000]  People are hurting, people are struggling, and so all options are on the table.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:53.239]  Just to clarify, you're calling for him to resign, but you are not willing to vote no confidence in his government?
[01:36:53.239 --> 01:36:55.619]  How do those two things connect?
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:57.420]  All options are on the table.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:58.779]  All options.
[01:36:59.619 --> 01:37:02.640]  What does this mean for your support with the Liberals, though?
[01:37:02.819 --> 01:37:06.840]  How can you say he needs to resign, but then you're not telling us what you're going to do for non-confidence?
[01:37:07.439 --> 01:37:08.859]  Telling you that all options are on the table.
[01:37:10.399 --> 01:37:17.460]  Will you support the FES and also are you willing to continue to support the liberals if there is a different leader aside from Trudeau?
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:23.340]  Right now that's not in front of us, there's no votes in front of us, but we will take each vote and right now literally everything's on the table.
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:32.420]  The young generation like Prime Minister Trudeau, half of this cabinet are actually young global leaders of the world economy.
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:34.739]  So we penetrate the cabinet.
[01:37:35.770 --> 01:37:37.609]  The change is not just happening.
[01:37:38.250 --> 01:37:42.590]  The change can be shaped by us.
[01:37:42.949 --> 01:37:45.750]  We have to prepare for a more angry world.
[01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:50.510]  How to prepare to take the necessary action to create the feral world.
[01:37:53.170 --> 01:37:55.329]  I see the need for a great reset.
[01:37:55.590 --> 01:38:02.989]  So people assume we are just going back to the good old world which we had and everything will be normal again.
[01:38:03.449 --> 01:38:06.189]  This is, let's say, fiction.
[01:38:06.529 --> 01:38:07.569]  It will not happen.
[01:38:07.930 --> 01:38:11.729]  There is only one way this pandemic is going to go.
[01:38:12.189 --> 01:38:15.649]  It's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:18.350]  Pay insufficient attention.
[01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:34.140]  To the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack, which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[01:38:35.300 --> 01:39:05.510]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber We are back now live inside the Infowars World Headquarters
[01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:07.069]  in Austin, Texas.
[01:39:07.529 --> 01:39:23.430]  And I want to show you what is being revealed inside of this bill that was rejected on its face, has resulted in a major political shift of the Republican Party,
[01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:29.170]  and now even has support for Elon Musk to be the next Speaker of the House.
[01:39:30.439 --> 01:39:34.579]  Pretty much meaning Mike Johnson's time is all but guaranteed up.
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:37.119]  First, you have this.
[01:39:37.319 --> 01:39:42.199]  Top COVID lawyer exposes spending bill as pandemic power grab framework, and it's all in there.
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:53.720]  The bill expands powers for mask mandates, vaccine passports, emergency health powers, gain-of-function research, and legal immunity.
[01:39:54.670 --> 01:39:57.489]  For mRNA gene therapy vaccine manufacturers.
[01:39:57.789 --> 01:40:03.569]  And of course Biden already granted that through 2029. Which just shows you.
[01:40:04.569 --> 01:40:06.710]  How much control Big Pharma has.
[01:40:07.289 --> 01:40:08.310]  And now.
[01:40:08.569 --> 01:40:11.210]  All of the vaccine injured people can't even sue.
[01:40:11.489 --> 01:40:12.930]  Thanks to Joe Biden protecting them.
[01:40:13.069 --> 01:40:18.930]  So this was an analysis from Grok's AI. On top of what we already see.
[01:40:20.170 --> 01:40:21.390]  From this bill.
[01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:28.439]  Analyze and list potential excessive concerning wasteful spending.
[01:40:28.439 --> 01:40:32.579]  Authorization of appropriations for recycling and composting accountability.
[01:40:32.859 --> 01:40:43.279]  Authorizes $4 million annually for fiscal years 2025 through 2029 for the Recycling and Compost Accountability Act.
[01:40:44.029 --> 01:40:53.930]  While environmental initiatives are important, the effectiveness and necessity of such a large allocation for administrative and reporting purposes might be questioned without detailed performance metrics or outcomes.
[01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:58.210]  No, it's just a slush fund to pay all their friends in the green economy.
[01:40:59.510 --> 01:41:03.149]  Funding for the recycling infrastructure and accessibility program.
[01:41:03.329 --> 01:41:04.430]  They actually did a study.
[01:41:04.569 --> 01:41:07.949]  Most of the recycling actually does more harm than good.
[01:41:08.590 --> 01:41:09.689]  That's another story.
[01:41:11.590 --> 01:41:18.989]  Drinking water infrastructure risk and resilience, diesel emissions reduction act reauthorization.
[01:41:18.989 --> 01:41:21.069]  They want to basically make diesel illegal.
[01:41:21.250 --> 01:41:23.250]  And they say, no, we're not making it illegal.
[01:41:23.250 --> 01:41:23.970]  Well, they are.
[01:41:24.069 --> 01:41:25.329]  They're pricing you out of it.
[01:41:25.369 --> 01:41:27.850]  So they're not technically making it illegal.
[01:41:28.010 --> 01:41:32.510]  They're going to make it so expensive to use with taxes and regulations that it's virtually illegal.
[01:41:37.230 --> 01:41:39.289]  General concerns across sections.
[01:41:39.489 --> 01:41:41.829]  Lack of sunset clauses or performance reviews.
[01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:43.229]  So this stuff just goes on forever.
[01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:44.489]  There's no audits.
[01:41:44.609 --> 01:41:45.750]  There's no performance reviews.
[01:41:45.989 --> 01:41:47.729]  Nobody knows what's going on with it.
[01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:53.949]  It's all cooked into this bill that thankfully failed.
[01:41:54.430 --> 01:42:04.470]  They want to give federal land back to Washington, D.C. and then federally fund it to use and build a new football stadium.
[01:42:05.439 --> 01:42:08.500]  They want to build a new football stadium with taxpayer dollars.
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:12.199]  You know, a league that generates billions in revenue.
[01:42:12.359 --> 01:42:17.500]  Owners that are worth billions of dollars, but they need your taxpayer money to build their playhouse.
[01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:18.880]  Yeah.
[01:42:20.479 --> 01:42:21.579]  That makes sense.
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:27.100]  Funding for music tourism.
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:31.300]  The American Music Tourism Act funding.
[01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:32.720]  Okay.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:33.119]  Okay.
[01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:35.829]  Music Tourism Act.
[01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:42.630]  General administration overlap.
[01:42:43.149 --> 01:42:46.989]  Just redundant government administration costs.
[01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:49.170]  Well, yeah, you gotta pay the government employees.
[01:42:49.170 --> 01:42:51.350]  They're so great at their job.
[01:42:51.649 --> 01:42:54.510]  Of course, Congress giving itself a raise.
[01:42:56.130 --> 01:42:58.189]  Because everybody believes Congress should get a raise.
[01:42:58.810 --> 01:43:00.270]  They do such a great job.
[01:43:03.289 --> 01:43:06.050]  Maybe they should all have to crowdfund their salaries.
[01:43:06.329 --> 01:43:08.529]  So then it's, you know, do people like you or not?
[01:43:09.210 --> 01:43:10.130]  Crowdfund your salary.
[01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:11.050]  See how that goes for you.
[01:43:13.529 --> 01:43:16.670]  So this is all part of a grok analysis.
[01:43:19.409 --> 01:43:21.770]  We'll post the whole thing at Infowars.
[01:43:23.409 --> 01:43:24.649]  Luckily, this has failed.
[01:43:26.029 --> 01:43:26.850]  You know, just...
[01:43:28.109 --> 01:43:33.409]  They want to pass it and hold it over your head right before Christmas and say, hey, you know, we got to fund the emergency relief.
[01:43:33.409 --> 01:43:34.350]  We got to fund the military.
[01:43:34.409 --> 01:43:35.510]  We got to fund the farmers.
[01:43:36.710 --> 01:43:38.270]  So just pass this thing before Christmas.
[01:43:38.289 --> 01:43:43.750]  And you say, well, that's like four pages of a 1,500-page bill.
[01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:45.250]  Can't we just remove the other pages?
[01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:46.590]  No, we got to do this now.
[01:43:46.590 --> 01:43:48.750]  And if you don't vote for it, we're not going home for Christmas.
[01:43:48.850 --> 01:43:49.729]  Well, then shut the government down.
[01:43:49.869 --> 01:43:51.149]  Well, you can't shut the government down.
[01:43:51.210 --> 01:43:51.630]  Well, why not?
[01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:55.340]  Other things in the bill.
[01:43:56.159 --> 01:43:59.180]  $850,000 for a gay senior home.
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:04.119]  The gay seniors need a special place, so they get about a million dollars for a gay senior home.
[01:44:04.859 --> 01:44:08.279]  $15 million to pay for Egyptians' college tuitions.
[01:44:10.119 --> 01:44:16.079]  I know you're thinking, when you're paying your taxes, if I could just fund Egyptians going to college, wouldn't that be great?
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:22.420]  $400,000 for a gay activist group to teach elementary kids about being trans.
[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:25.779]  Oh, a little grooming, a little sexual grooming of the youth.
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:30.000]  A little leftist, liberal, pedophile grooming for kids in the bill.
[01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:30.560]  Very nice.
[01:44:31.079 --> 01:44:34.939]  Half a million dollars for a diversity, equity, and inclusion zoo.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.180]  I don't even...
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:38.880]  What?
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:43.840]  What, nobody white is allowed to work there?
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:44.760]  Or it's like...
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:47.020]  Deformed zoo animals?
[01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:52.640]  Not sure what the diversity, equity, and inclusion zoo is, but they get half a mil.
[01:44:54.079 --> 01:44:59.680]  $400,000 for a group to give clothes to teens to help them hide their gender.
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:00.279]  Oh!
[01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:02.619]  Help them hide their gender.
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:09.619]  So you have the chest binders, you have the little male genitalia smashers.
[01:45:09.779 --> 01:45:10.720]  That's nice.
[01:45:10.859 --> 01:45:11.340]  That's good.
[01:45:12.279 --> 01:45:13.800]  So glad we got funding for that.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:21.739]  You know these sick perverts actually make products that they want to shove down your daughter's pants?
[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:23.560]  Sorry for being graphic here.
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:25.359]  I know it's absolutely disgusting and despicable.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:26.159]  No, they do.
[01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:32.439]  Liberals make little male genitalia parts and they want to put them in your daughter's pants.
[01:45:33.539 --> 01:45:35.899]  Called itty bitty backers.
[01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:39.260]  They're going to fund a little bit of that in this bill too.
[01:45:41.210 --> 01:45:43.850]  Liberals will do anything to reach down your kids' pants, apparently.
[01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:48.670]  It's all about diversity, equity, and inclusion.
[01:45:48.670 --> 01:45:50.329]  It's all about trans kids.
[01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:52.670]  So they just want access to your kids.
[01:45:52.729 --> 01:45:54.350]  They want access to their minds, their bodies.
[01:45:54.449 --> 01:45:55.310]  They want to chop them up.
[01:45:55.409 --> 01:45:56.590]  They want to put things down their pants.
[01:45:56.689 --> 01:45:57.470]  These are sick freaks.
[01:45:57.770 --> 01:46:00.109]  And they're putting it in their spending bills, too.
[01:46:01.529 --> 01:46:08.890]  You know, they love Obamacare so much, but it's strange because this bill exempted members of Congress from Obamacare.
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:13.979]  So that great Obamacare that they all love so much, they're exempt from it.
[01:46:14.079 --> 01:46:16.020]  They don't even have to use it because they don't want to.
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:18.640]  Very nice.
[01:46:20.779 --> 01:46:23.880]  It had an extension for the Global Engagement Center.
[01:46:24.119 --> 01:46:29.880]  Of course, the Global Engagement Center was part of the censorship apparatus.
[01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:37.439]  Censoring you if you said something that they didn't like about COVID or vaccines or masks.
[01:46:37.659 --> 01:46:41.460]  Censoring you if you said something about the Hunter Biden laptop or the Biden crime family.
[01:46:42.579 --> 01:46:43.699]  You would get censored.
[01:46:43.819 --> 01:46:45.880]  Oh, we're going to fund that in this bill.
[01:46:47.359 --> 01:46:48.880]  They want to change...
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:50.880]  This is about as liberal progressive as it gets.
[01:46:51.359 --> 01:46:57.260]  They want to change government document text, legal text...
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  Striking the term offender and inserting justice-involved individual.
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:17.020]  In the matter preceding subparagraph A, by striking offender and inserting justice-involved individual.
[01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:20.479]  So you're no longer an offender, you're a justice-involved individual.
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:24.340]  Well, you know, that's kind of open for interpretation.
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:25.960]  Justice-involved individual?
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:27.560]  That kind of actually has a positive light.
[01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:31.810]  Oh, I see here you're a justice-involved individual.
[01:47:31.890 --> 01:47:38.069]  Wow, what type of activities did you engage in to help the community achieve justice?
[01:47:38.489 --> 01:47:40.430]  Oh, I'm just a rapist and a murderer.
[01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:42.430]  Oh, you mean you're an offender?
[01:47:42.689 --> 01:47:43.609]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[01:47:43.710 --> 01:47:45.409]  You can't call me an offender anymore!
[01:47:46.130 --> 01:47:47.270]  Didn't you see the bill?
[01:47:48.729 --> 01:47:50.229]  I am no longer an offender.
[01:47:50.350 --> 01:47:52.750]  I am now a justice-involved individual.
[01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:54.310]  This sheds me in a positive light.
[01:47:55.890 --> 01:47:57.590]  Very loving, very liberal.
[01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:03.079]  They're trying to cover up the crimes of the January 6 Committee.
[01:48:29.850 --> 01:48:36.569]  For a House office, if compliance with the legal process would require the disclosure of House data of the House office.
[01:48:36.729 --> 01:48:45.270]  So this is literally all about the January 6th committee covering up their evidence, deleting evidence.
[01:48:45.289 --> 01:48:47.550]  It's destruction of evidence, tampering of evidence.
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:58.560]  It's the same reason why they're asking for preemptive pardons from Biden.
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:08.119]  The members of the January 6th committee want a preemptive pardon because right before the The Republicans were about to take over the committee.
[01:49:08.539 --> 01:49:21.779]  When Republicans took over the House in 2022, they were set to take over the January 6th committee, giving them access to all the documents and all the evidence and everything that the previous January 6th committee had.
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:30.600]  And right before the Republicans took over the chair and the new Congress was sworn in, the January 6th committee erased evidence.
[01:49:30.779 --> 01:49:31.819]  Oh, I'm sorry, they lost it.
[01:49:31.899 --> 01:49:33.319]  Apparently it's a glitch, a technical error.
[01:49:33.439 --> 01:49:34.500]  They just lost all their evidence.
[01:49:36.269 --> 01:49:37.390]  So, no.
[01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:38.350]  They committed a crime.
[01:49:38.350 --> 01:49:39.449]  They deleted the evidence.
[01:49:40.149 --> 01:49:44.750]  And now they want this portion of the bill to protect them.
[01:49:45.590 --> 01:49:47.289]  To protect them.
[01:49:48.069 --> 01:49:49.970]  So that's basically an admittance of guilt.
[01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:52.289]  So begging for a pardon and admittance of guilt.
[01:49:52.810 --> 01:50:03.529]  Begging for this to be in the bill saying, hey, can we put some legal framework in this bill to protect us from any charges since we committed crimes on our way out?
[01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:05.859]  Another admittance of guilt.
[01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:09.479]  Crazy stuff in this bill.
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:10.960]  Now, I don't know what comes of it now.
[01:50:11.479 --> 01:50:13.039]  Hopefully they just shut down the government.
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:20.899]  It needs to happen because then people can also see, oh, they keep saying shut down the government and I'm supposed to be scared of it.
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:23.600]  And then the government will shut down and people see, oh, my life didn't really change at all.
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:24.800]  Maybe it's not so bad after all.
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:26.159]  Maybe we should shut down the government.
[01:50:26.899 --> 01:50:28.239]  But the whole thing is just a mystery.
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:29.420]  They don't know what's going to happen now.
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:31.800]  Supposed to vote on it last night, totally scrapped.
[01:50:31.899 --> 01:50:32.920]  The bill is dead on arrival.
[01:50:33.199 --> 01:50:34.859]  The Republicans want nothing to do with it now.
[01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:36.460]  They want nothing to do with Mike Johnson.
[01:50:36.699 --> 01:50:40.140]  They either get single-issue bills, or I don't think they get anything, quite frankly.
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:43.439]  And then you put it on the Democrats.
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:48.439]  The Republicans will vote right now on a single-issue bill for disaster relief.
[01:50:49.289 --> 01:50:50.069]  They could pass it.
[01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:55.149]  The Republicans will vote right now for a single issue bill for the money for the farmers.
[01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:56.430]  That would get passed.
[01:50:56.670 --> 01:50:58.390]  They could do single issue bills.
[01:50:58.569 --> 01:50:59.890]  Those are the two most important bills.
[01:51:00.770 --> 01:51:07.890]  They could do a single issue bill on both of those things, at least to fund it for another month before the incoming administration.
[01:51:11.239 --> 01:51:14.159]  And they could pass those bills immediately with the Republican votes.
[01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:17.680]  And then if the Democrats don't vote for it, now you've embarrassed them.
[01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:21.140]  You've shown America what the Democrat Party is really all about.
[01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:24.899]  And this whole bluff about shutting down the government is them wanting to shut it down.
[01:51:26.010 --> 01:51:27.489]  Unless they get this pork barrel bill.
[01:51:27.989 --> 01:51:29.090]  So that's the move.
[01:51:29.210 --> 01:51:30.689]  But the whole thing is a mystery now.
[01:51:30.949 --> 01:51:31.890]  We'll see what happens.
[01:51:32.029 --> 01:51:33.029]  I say just shut it down.
[01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:35.930]  It's really unfortunate, but it all needs to be exposed.
[01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:37.529]  The Democrats funded illegal immigrants.
[01:51:37.670 --> 01:51:39.050]  They gave all your money to illegal immigrants.
[01:51:39.210 --> 01:51:40.970]  They don't want to fund the disaster relief.
[01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:42.550]  They don't want to help the farmers.
[01:51:42.750 --> 01:51:43.949]  They need to be exposed.
[01:51:44.210 --> 01:51:45.550]  They shut down the government.
[01:51:45.810 --> 01:51:46.729]  They're the corrupt ones.
[01:51:46.909 --> 01:51:48.390]  That's how you play politics here.
[01:51:49.109 --> 01:51:52.050]  Christmas ornaments, drywall and Jerry Epstein.
[01:51:52.909 --> 01:51:55.189]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:51:56.470 --> 01:51:58.729]  There are three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:51:59.149 --> 01:52:02.310]  Drywall, Christmas tree lights, and Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:52:02.689 --> 01:52:05.369]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in free fall.
[01:52:05.470 --> 01:52:07.350]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[01:52:07.770 --> 01:52:13.810]  Trump is officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal human trafficking and sex slavery.
[01:52:14.250 --> 01:52:17.090]  We're going to take control January 20th, and people are going to be held accountable.
[01:52:17.310 --> 01:52:18.529]  We're going to be very transparent.
[01:52:18.729 --> 01:52:19.630]  We're going to get behind.
[01:52:19.810 --> 01:52:23.050]  What did the United Nations have to do with the open border crisis?
[01:52:23.250 --> 01:52:24.789]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[01:52:24.899 --> 01:52:29.060]  We're going to be very transparent American people, and we're going to tell them the truth of what happened on this border.
[01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:30.539]  Again, by design.
[01:52:30.699 --> 01:52:32.199]  And so much more is happening.
[01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:33.239]  This is an exciting time.
[01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:35.420]  But the globalists are striking back.
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:39.520]  That's why it's important to keep our operation on air now more than ever.
[01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:41.479]  And we can't do it without you.
[01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:42.460]  So we make it easy.
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:52.560]  Go to thealexshonestore.com and get the most amazing, widest selection of patriot apparel anywhere to spread the word, to meet like-minded people, and support the InfoWard.
[01:52:52.699 --> 01:52:53.100]  Now...
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:53:02.020]  The folks at Bigly that power the AlexJoeStore.com have come out with some amazing limited edition Christmas hoodies and sweaters.
[01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:03.659]  And I personally love this one.
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:07.359]  I'm not usually into wearing a shirt with myself on it, but this one's really cool.
[01:53:07.539 --> 01:53:09.819]  And the family and friends will have so much fun.
[01:53:09.939 --> 01:53:11.140]  It's a great conversation piece.
[01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:13.100]  And this will horrify.
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:18.020]  Leftists, and then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall shaking in fear when you're walking on the street.
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:18.699]  Say, it's okay.
[01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:23.800]  Alex Jones doesn't bite, though it kind of does look like I'm Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.
[01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:30.420]  There's so many other great limited edition shirts, hoodies, sweaters right now.
[01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:33.800]  And then, of course, there's the Darth Sidious hoodies.
[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:36.180]  Trump won, I'm afraid.
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:43.369]  While you're there, believe me, If you love our information, you're gonna love the supplements like Ultimate Seamoss.
[01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:45.189]  That is the ultimate super food.
[01:53:45.449 --> 01:53:47.630]  It's the strongest, one of the strongest out there.
[01:53:47.829 --> 01:53:49.710]  We get it from a top supplier.
[01:53:49.710 --> 01:53:50.550]  It's private label.
[01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:51.510]  It is super strong.
[01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:54.010]  Equivalent of 40 grams per serving.
[01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:55.470]  That's two capsules.
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:59.399]  Of sea moss with the very best organic iodine, the very best vitaminerals.
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:03.119]  It's a superfood of superfoods for a reason.
[01:54:03.279 --> 01:54:05.760]  Get your ultimate sea moss discounted and a lot more.

[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:02.680]  And I looked at it, and I was like, oh my god, this is the superfood other than maybe hemp.
[01:55:03.289 --> 01:55:04.689]  But it does other effects than him.

[01:55:30.689 --> 01:55:32.949]  Pretty dangerous for me and Trump, but we wouldn't be anywhere else.
[01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:35.390]  Thanks for keeping me and President Trump in the fight.
[01:55:35.630 --> 01:55:36.670]  God bless and good luck.
[01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:38.310]  Oh, and I almost forgot.
[01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:41.210]  Merry, Merry Christmas to everybody.
[01:55:41.369 --> 01:55:44.250]  That's so triggering to the left, but I also love Christmas.
[01:55:44.649 --> 01:55:47.989]  And a Happy New Year with President Trump about to come into office.
[01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:50.390]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer here.
[01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:53.630]  My time on The Jones Show for today is about to come to an end.
[01:55:53.789 --> 01:55:56.189]  We're going to be handing the reins over to Dark Journalist.
[01:55:56.250 --> 01:55:57.829]  I'm going to introduce him here in...
[01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:03.720]  Just a few short seconds so you can understand what he is about to get into today.
[01:56:04.619 --> 01:56:06.699]  And I want to close something up here.
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:11.220]  And I'm going to explain this.
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:15.640]  I'm going to record a segment for the War Room coming up later on today as well.
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:18.260]  But this is the strategy.
[01:56:18.399 --> 01:56:20.619]  We, the people, have had a major victory.
[01:56:21.539 --> 01:56:24.939]  We stopped this spending bill from happening.
[01:56:24.939 --> 01:56:27.000]  A total defeat of big government.
[01:56:27.890 --> 01:56:30.850]  Now, the job is not done, and there's two paths forward as I see it.
[01:56:30.949 --> 01:56:32.130]  But we have a say now.
[01:56:32.250 --> 01:56:32.989]  We have a will now.
[01:56:33.130 --> 01:56:34.310]  We have our hands on the wheel now.
[01:56:34.510 --> 01:56:35.829]  We can control our destiny now.
[01:56:36.829 --> 01:56:43.390]  And that's why calling out their planned pandemic 2.0 to disrupt the Trump administration again is important.
[01:56:43.869 --> 01:56:48.489]  But it's also important to put out the winning strategy here so that they can run with it.
[01:56:48.789 --> 01:56:49.810]  To me, there's two options.
[01:56:49.970 --> 01:56:52.970]  One, if you're the Republicans, you say, screw it, we're done, shut down the government.
[01:56:53.010 --> 01:56:53.550]  We're done.
[01:56:54.890 --> 01:56:55.949]  You had your chance.
[01:56:57.380 --> 01:56:59.079]  And you wouldn't give us single-issue bills.
[01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:03.939]  And you gave us 1,500 pages to read in two days.
[01:57:04.180 --> 01:57:06.039]  You violated the 72-hour rule.
[01:57:06.279 --> 01:57:07.319]  Shut down the government.
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:09.300]  And I would own it, too.
[01:57:09.539 --> 01:57:11.800]  Say, the Democrats want to blame us for shutting down the government?
[01:57:11.939 --> 01:57:13.000]  Well, really, it's their fault.
[01:57:13.079 --> 01:57:13.539]  But you know what?
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:13.859]  Good.
[01:57:14.039 --> 01:57:15.880]  We think it's a good thing to shut down the government.
[01:57:15.979 --> 01:57:16.600]  The government's corrupt.
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:17.260]  It's out of control.
[01:57:17.539 --> 01:57:18.140]  Shut it down.
[01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:19.939]  And then just own that narrative.
[01:57:21.699 --> 01:57:26.619]  Or, and you probably do this first, you come out with two bills.
[01:57:28.029 --> 01:57:36.350]  That will fund the government for a month for disaster relief and for farmers until Trump gets sworn in.
[01:57:37.770 --> 01:57:42.590]  And you say, two bills, one page each, disaster relief and farm aid.
[01:57:43.710 --> 01:57:52.909]  And if the Democrats don't want to sign it, then you go right back to plan two, which is, okay, you're shutting down the government because you don't want to fund the bills unless you get all your pork.
[01:57:54.029 --> 01:57:55.289]  So we're going to shut down the government.
[01:57:55.409 --> 01:58:01.229]  But if you want to blame us for the government shutdown, we'll actually take that as a compliment because the government is corrupt.
[01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:02.449]  The people are sick of it.
[01:58:02.590 --> 01:58:03.369]  It's out of control.
[01:58:03.590 --> 01:58:05.649]  It spends too much money, and this is total proof.
[01:58:05.829 --> 01:58:12.970]  So fine, even though it's your fault because you wouldn't pass the spending bills, we'll take the blame because we actually think the government needs to be shut down.
[01:58:13.090 --> 01:58:13.569]  It's out of control.
[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:21.119]  And then you can deal with what you want to do in the next Speaker of the House when the next Congress gets sworn in at the beginning of next month.
[01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:23.840]  But right now, that's what you've got to do with this bill.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:30.500]  I'd just say, okay, two pages, single bill issues, take it or leave it.
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:31.300]  Oh, you don't want it.
[01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:32.399]  Okay, shut down the government.
[01:58:32.619 --> 01:58:33.100]  Merry Christmas.
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:39.140]  Total victory, and then people will see, oh, the government shut down, and then their lives won't change at all.
[01:58:39.619 --> 01:58:43.560]  They won't even notice a difference in their life, and all the fear-mongering will go away.
[01:58:45.859 --> 01:58:54.779]  So that's a big strategy, but getting out ahead of this fake pandemic is, or maybe a real pandemic, maybe they release a real bioweapon, I don't know, getting out ahead of that is going to be very important too.
[01:58:54.979 --> 01:58:57.560]  Keeping our eyes on the Fauci's of the world and others is going to be very important.
[01:58:57.739 --> 01:59:04.199]  So, Dark Journalist is about to take over the show now, and a lot of this does have to do with continuity of government.
[01:59:05.029 --> 01:59:12.090]  And I know you're going to be getting into the latest dealing with the UFOs and the drones and everything that's going on with that.
[01:59:12.210 --> 01:59:21.630]  But a lot of this massive funding and government bureaucracy redundancy that we see here, a lot of that is continuity of government.
[01:59:21.729 --> 01:59:28.270]  They want to create this massive governing body so that they get oversight and regulation over everything.
[01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:33.510]  And there's no transaction in your life that is free from government intervention.
[01:59:35.870 --> 01:59:36.310]  Exactly.
[01:59:36.689 --> 01:59:41.510]  Owen, any emergency power will do to activate those types of controls.
[01:59:41.710 --> 01:59:42.310]  That's the key.
[01:59:42.590 --> 01:59:51.789]  So whether it's a bird flu, whether it's the UFO file, whether it's a cybercom attack, whatever it happens to be a nuclear event, all of them are capable of it.
[01:59:51.829 --> 01:59:54.069]  The question is, what gets the job done?
[01:59:54.289 --> 02:00:00.050]  And I think they're gathering data on all different types of scenarios, like the things you've been laying out here in the first two hours.
[02:00:00.579 --> 02:00:03.939]  Well, and it's, of course, convenient that they have all of this going on, right?
[02:00:04.159 --> 02:00:08.579]  Just months ahead, just days ahead of the incoming Trump administration.
[02:00:08.939 --> 02:00:17.840]  I think their plan is to sabotage in a much more aggressive way the beginning of his administration, not with kind of the political stuff like the fake Russian collusion and Spygate.
[02:00:17.979 --> 02:00:22.859]  They want to do what they did on the back end, pandemic, UFOs, whatever, throw things into chaos.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.260]  So hopefully he's ready for that.
[02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:26.279]  You're going to be laying it all out.
[02:00:26.819 --> 02:00:29.359]  Taking over The Alex Jones Show in 90 seconds.
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:30.760]  Owen Schroer signing off for now.
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:34.199]  I'm gonna have a quick update on the War Room later, and then I'll be back and I'll see you tomorrow.
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:35.659]  Fantastic, everyone.
[02:00:36.060 --> 02:00:42.779]  I am dark journalist Daniel List, and I'm here guest hosting The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:45.489]  For InfoWars and just fantastic.
[02:00:45.930 --> 02:00:52.789]  When I was on the show last week, I mentioned to Alex that I always considered him an architect of the independent media.
[02:00:52.949 --> 02:00:55.670]  So it's a great honor to be here with you.
[02:00:55.989 --> 02:01:07.949]  And after hearing all these things about emergency powers in the first two hours, I have to emphasize that the whole drone scare that we witnessed for this whole period of the last couple of weeks, say three weeks, heavy.
[02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:10.590]  And it's been ongoing a lot in the background.
[02:01:11.060 --> 02:01:16.319]  Is all about the same exact issue, which is emergency powers, emergency powers.
[02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:21.659]  When you hear them activate that emergency powers, it gives them a whole different slate of controls.
[02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:25.020]  And that's what we're going to get into here as well.
[02:01:25.710 --> 02:01:34.050]  And it's great also, I have to say, we can get into the UFO file and deal with issues of this depth and go that deep on them.
[02:01:34.649 --> 02:01:35.689]  It's very exciting.
[02:01:35.869 --> 02:01:39.489]  So for Alex to let me host the show is a great honor and I appreciate it.
[02:01:39.810 --> 02:01:45.250]  One of the things I want to mention as well, there's been a lot of talk about continuity of government.
[02:01:45.449 --> 02:01:48.930]  The thing about continuity of government is not very well understood.
[02:01:49.590 --> 02:01:51.609]  And I'm going to get deep into it tonight.
[02:01:51.609 --> 02:01:58.909]  We've put a number of shows together at The Dark Journalist Show, putting together and outlining what continuity of government is.
[02:01:59.069 --> 02:02:12.869]  So we're going to become very familiar with some of these acronyms, COG, UFO, UAP, SSP. These are very crucial, and going into them, even PSYOP is again an acronym.
[02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:17.369]  So we're going to expand the meanings of what they are and how this all works together.
[02:02:17.369 --> 02:02:29.869]  But there's no question that we're in a moment of constitutional crisis when you see these things happening just before a new president-elect is sworn in on January 20th.
[02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:40.909]  Now I have some breaking news in relation to this, which is the FAA has just announced that they are banning drones and authorizing the use of deadly force against drones.
[02:02:41.399 --> 02:02:42.619]  Over New Jersey.
[02:02:42.859 --> 02:02:45.220]  Now, this is a major breaking story.
[02:02:45.359 --> 02:02:46.180]  It just came out.
[02:02:46.579 --> 02:02:51.500]  And the FAA bans drones over parts of New Jersey, threatens deadly force for imminent security threats.
[02:02:51.619 --> 02:02:53.420]  So the FAA has got on board with it.
[02:02:53.479 --> 02:03:01.539]  The strange thing here for me when we're looking at this is that this gets rolled out, but it only lasts until January 17th.
[02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:11.770]  Now, it is major because it's the first major acknowledgement that the UFO file is active here and that this drone threat, they're finally acknowledging it.
[02:03:12.710 --> 02:03:20.789]  I've seen a lot of things going on around the mainstream media kind of getting us out of the zone on this story in terms of the truth.
[02:03:20.970 --> 02:03:27.989]  And the independent media has missed the boat in a way because they keep going along with this idea that, oh, they're planes or whatever.
[02:03:28.270 --> 02:03:34.850]  Well, I'm going to show you some examples as we get into this today of some of these drones that really look like planes.
[02:03:34.989 --> 02:03:36.289]  They're designed to look like planes.
[02:03:36.430 --> 02:03:44.550]  But when you see things as big as an SUV hovering over New Jersey, people from every walk of life look at that and say, I've never seen anything like that.
[02:03:44.789 --> 02:03:47.590]  We have multiple witnesses in relationship to this.
[02:03:47.909 --> 02:03:55.789]  So then we have to ask ourselves, what is the relationship of these emergency powers from continuity of government to something like a drone swarm from the skies?
[02:03:56.340 --> 02:04:26.449]  What I'm going to lay out for you today is that we've seen this for a long time in the background being set up, which is a maximum threat from above and using a UFO threat narrative, which is something that the Central Intelligence Agency with the NSA and the NGA have been working in the background on to give us that threat narrative since 2017. And a funny little story that came out in the New York Times in 2017 that gave us this whole threat piece with whistleblowers who
[02:04:26.449 --> 02:04:30.189]  turned out to all be undercover counterintelligence agents.
[02:04:30.609 --> 02:04:32.970]  So that was not a very open process.
[02:04:33.130 --> 02:04:42.750]  And what you have when you get into this, you have to get really deep and say, you have the UFO file, the real thing, and then you have the false CIA narrative.
[02:04:43.199 --> 02:04:49.100]  The CIA narrative about the threat from the sky is what they're gathering and doing data mining on now.
[02:04:49.279 --> 02:04:56.859]  So we're going to get into that today as well as SSP. And SSP, that acronym is the Secret Space Program.
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:03.220]  And even to imagine that they've been building a secret space program in the background seems quite fantastic.
[02:05:03.439 --> 02:05:09.760]  And yet, we have not been back to the moon since 1972. Well, that's a little unusual, don't you think?
[02:05:09.979 --> 02:05:15.399]  I mean, the whole program was built to set us up and put us into space, and now it's all privatized.
[02:05:15.399 --> 02:05:21.560]  And we have the likes of these independent groups going into space and NASA sort of standing there in a sideline role.
[02:05:22.199 --> 02:05:25.159]  These are all very unusual pieces as we get into this.
[02:05:25.319 --> 02:05:36.159]  And so when we look at groups that control this aspect and when we see what they're doing with the UFO threat, then we start to see, ah, they've been planning this in the background for a very long time.
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:43.899]  One of the things I want to mention about NORTHCOM and COG and their relationship to the UFO file is there's a division.
[02:05:43.899 --> 02:05:45.319]  I'm going to reveal this today.
[02:05:45.579 --> 02:06:00.810]  There's a division here right inside the continuity of government program called BLUE. That program, Blue, inside of COG is the UFOphile, and this is an unlimited access,
[02:06:01.050 --> 02:06:02.229]  special access group.
[02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:07.029]  They go in and they work with the whole UFOphile threat aspect.
[02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:25.109]  This is absolutely crucial because When you get into the constitutional issues around this, you're looking at a group like NORTHCOM, for example, which didn't even exist until the emergencies of September 11th, and it wasn't called into being until 2002. There's a good reason for that,
[02:06:25.130 --> 02:06:38.949]  because in the Constitution and in our laws in America, we have something called posse comitatus, which says the feds can't run the people in the United States, that it's a police-oriented thing, and you can't bring in the military.
[02:06:40.039 --> 02:06:44.800]  So those laws have been standing up there since just after the Civil War and Reconstruction.
[02:06:45.060 --> 02:06:50.500]  So violating those laws becomes kind of their major goal in the middle of all this.
[02:06:50.640 --> 02:07:00.640]  So when we hear about things like martial law and totalitarian takeover and things, there's an actual process that they've built in with NORTHCOM on how to do that.
[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:03.859]  So we're going to get into how that rolls out.
[02:07:04.220 --> 02:07:05.560]  Who are the players involved?
[02:07:05.779 --> 02:07:07.560]  What's the historical aspect around it?
[02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:22.199]  And how it plays into current events here, which we're seeing on the ground in real time, live, And the drone threat, I can tell you from the things that I've heard from a number of different people on the ground, they have never seen the likes of this.
[02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:33.920]  So this becomes very important for us as we get into these various sightings and what they're doing with the UFO file, which, remember, is the highest secret in the national security state.
[02:07:34.100 --> 02:07:37.779]  And that was a physicist named Robert Saarbacher who put that on the record.
[02:07:37.939 --> 02:07:42.720]  And he said the secret aspect of this threat was above nuclear.
[02:07:44.170 --> 02:07:58.510]  So, their secretive aspect and the groups that they have in place, one of those groups I refer to as XProtect, they will apply lethal force, they'll destroy reputations, they'll change news stories, they'll put up front companies, whatever it takes.
[02:07:58.979 --> 02:08:05.039]  To keep that secret of the advanced exotic technology residing inside the UFO file.
[02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:17.159]  It's a crucial aspect in the mix and the drone story and the incredible arrogance of the people that are launching the drones through our skies gives us an opportunity to put an excellent spotlight on this with perfect timing.
[02:08:17.539 --> 02:08:23.399]  With the Trump administration coming in, there's no question that these two things are in fact related.
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:26.520]  I want to mention something else here.
[02:08:27.250 --> 02:08:36.090]  In relation to Infowars and all the coverage that Alex did around the shootings and the attempted assassinations of President Trump.
[02:08:36.890 --> 02:08:41.229]  Assassinations are a very interesting part of our American history, of course.
[02:08:41.470 --> 02:08:50.409]  So the JFK assassination is something that researcher Professor Peter Dale Scott refers to as the first deep state revolt against the White House.
[02:08:51.010 --> 02:08:58.409]  This is very important because we need to understand why that deep state needs that control and why assassination is their crucial weapon.
[02:08:58.609 --> 02:09:08.510]  In the case of the JFK assassination, we also need to see that there's been a UFO file aspect hiding beneath that story for 61 years.
[02:09:08.710 --> 02:09:16.140]  That's why those records have been so Sat on by the intelligence agencies and they have not wanted them to come out.
[02:09:16.359 --> 02:09:23.800]  This is the crucial aspect of it because, of course, they were ordered in 1992 by Congress to release them in 25 years.
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:32.460]  That would have been October 26, 2017. When we look at the JFK assassination, we can see the outline of what was going on here.
[02:09:32.659 --> 02:09:49.649]  They were building an entire infrastructure for controlling things on the ground And a big kind of wedge in their plans is Kennedy comes in with all this knowledge around the UFO file, and he is someone who through,
[02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:58.689]  for example, Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, fellow Catholic and his best friend who actually brought him to Berlin after the war.
[02:09:59.909 --> 02:10:01.930]  He's controlling the MJ-12 file.
[02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:17.590]  So, you know, the whole aspect there of Forrestal controlling that and then sharing that with Kennedy, of course, he shared a fate very similar to JFK, but it happened in 1949. Remember, Forrestal was the first defense secretary.
[02:10:17.590 --> 02:10:27.149]  He was logged into Bethesda Naval Hospital supposedly for depression and unfortunately ended up flying out a window there, 13th floor.
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:42.800]  It's very important to note that when you get around the UFO file, the list of mysterious deaths reads just like the list of mysterious deaths around the JFK assassination or some of these other deep events like 9-11 and others.
[02:10:43.079 --> 02:10:50.260]  Of course, even Watergate and the Epstein aspects, all of them have their various death lists.
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:53.979]  And this is a way of removing witnesses who may get you into trouble.
[02:10:54.350 --> 02:10:59.449]  Later, when it comes down to any type of DOJ action.
[02:11:00.409 --> 02:11:18.210]  I do think that it's important for us to note in this period of time that the pledge by Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with President Trump in August when he joined the campaign and through his entire support behind Trump, which is a crucial, crucial moment in this campaign and for 2024 in general.
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:28.739]  When that took place and they got up there and pledged to release the JFK files, this was a huge earthquake and the ripples went straight back to the deep state.
[02:11:28.979 --> 02:11:43.380]  And this is a real problem for the deep state because they're looking at this and they're saying, there's Trump with his deep knowledge and his attempt, remember, during Trump 1, the first administration, to create the Space Force.
[02:11:43.579 --> 02:11:48.340]  And people still don't quite grasp just how important that Space Force development was.
[02:11:48.939 --> 02:11:58.340]  But ever since the days of Eisenhower, this advanced technology UFO file has been out of the hands of the executive branch.
[02:11:58.500 --> 02:11:59.439]  And there have been attempts.
[02:11:59.619 --> 02:12:03.960]  Kennedy made an attempt by dissolving the CIA, which was what he was trying to do.
[02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:10.619]  That was an attempt to pull that secret information back under the executive branch where it belongs.
[02:12:11.719 --> 02:12:22.560]  And instead, we've had a succession of presidents, and the only ones who've gotten anywhere close to it, I'd say, are Carter and Reagan until Trump with the Space Force.
[02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:36.760]  And I think one of the important things that they did with Trump is they recognized very early on, and this may be why all of the trouble, sometimes you have to look for what's the root of the trouble in relation to these political battles.
[02:12:37.079 --> 02:12:44.319]  Because we've seen political battles in the past, but we've never seen anything like the kind of vitriol that they've had for President Trump.
[02:12:44.479 --> 02:12:45.340]  Well, why is that?
[02:12:45.659 --> 02:12:51.239]  Well, is it because he's a loudmouth political guy, a real estate boss and TV personality?
[02:12:51.779 --> 02:13:09.109]  Or is it because in his own background, we have, again, this signature of exotic technology and the UFO file through the figure of his uncle, John Trump, Professor John Trump at MIT. I remember going over to MIT,
[02:13:09.350 --> 02:13:13.850]  which is close by here, and getting the files on John Trump.
[02:13:14.170 --> 02:13:17.829]  And it's quite interesting because most of that information is gone.
[02:13:18.069 --> 02:13:24.909]  But John Trump was a very key player, deep, deep in that American establishment of black projects.
[02:13:25.329 --> 02:13:33.329]  And very often, you know, it's mused about, why is Trump talking about his Well, there's a good reason.
[02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:59.880]  It becomes the untold story in the background of Trump and the various issues that are going on there.
[02:14:00.079 --> 02:14:05.800]  So when you were looking at Tesla's information, he's developing this X technology in the background.
[02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:08.340]  And the government is tapping in.
[02:14:08.439 --> 02:14:10.680]  And they're saying, what's going on with this information?
[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:11.939]  We need to track this guy.
[02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:21.520]  And when he dies suddenly, they want to send in somebody that they can really trust on the inside who's familiar with the advanced exotic technology program.
[02:14:21.619 --> 02:14:22.640]  Well, that was John Trump.
[02:14:23.159 --> 02:14:30.899]  And the person who sent him in, that figure, Vannevar Bush, not only was he the dean of MIT, but he was in charge of the UFO file.
[02:14:31.479 --> 02:14:33.880]  So John Trump was his protege.
[02:14:34.100 --> 02:14:36.460]  So there's no question that there's a connection there.
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:39.680]  That's something that we brought forward a number of years ago.
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:48.779]  And one of the reasons I bring it forward is I think it's a crucial aspect when you're looking at Trump because this technology has gone underground.
[02:14:49.399 --> 02:14:55.079]  And it represents an amazing leap for all of the different industries in America, including energy.
[02:14:55.319 --> 02:15:02.439]  But in particular, the things that they were looking at with Tesla's information was weaponry.
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:07.579]  And when it comes to the UFO file, there's something deep, deep in that UFO file.
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:09.939]  There's a property called apotheum.
[02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:11.119]  I'm going to spell it out for you.
[02:15:11.279 --> 02:15:23.840]  It's A-P-O-T-H-E-U-M. That apotheum is what you hear about whenever there is a UFO sighting or an encounter.
[02:15:24.119 --> 02:15:26.039]  You have all these people reporting things.
[02:15:26.140 --> 02:15:26.800]  What do they report?
[02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:29.140]  They report missing time.
[02:15:29.659 --> 02:15:31.439]  Well, time goes missing.
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:35.560]  Well, some of them report that the aspects get really deep.
[02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:41.420]  And I remember speaking to Professor John Mack over at Harvard, who was a leading advocate around this.
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:51.489]  And he died mysteriously in 2005. But before he did, he told me that there were a number of things associated with the UFO file.
[02:15:51.789 --> 02:15:55.750]  When people would be abducted and things of this nature, they would go through things.
[02:15:55.789 --> 02:15:57.770]  Well, that defies physics completely.
[02:15:57.970 --> 02:15:58.930]  So does missing time.
[02:15:59.270 --> 02:16:06.050]  Another aspect, of course, around the UFO file is when these crafts land, nothing anywhere will grow for miles around.
[02:16:06.979 --> 02:16:08.079]  That's very unusual.
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:11.899]  So what it is, you have a reality distortion physics.
[02:16:12.140 --> 02:16:15.340]  That's the thing that they're tracking deep there in the background.
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:19.479]  That's why Professor Trump was involved with Tesla's papers.
[02:16:19.739 --> 02:16:22.159]  That's the same technology resides in the same place.
[02:16:22.300 --> 02:16:24.399]  And that is in the deep UFO file.
[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:39.809]  And I'm going to show you how that file has occasionally been brought to the surface at times as these breakaway groups that have the technology now sense the need To break back in and to come back and reintroduce some of this technology,
[02:16:39.809 --> 02:16:45.370]  but with a story, which is, oh, you know, we've been fighting this UFO threat for you, but don't worry.
[02:16:45.549 --> 02:16:47.690]  We need those emergency powers to do that.
[02:16:47.870 --> 02:16:51.069]  So that is the nature of it.
[02:16:51.229 --> 02:17:06.340]  And I'll tell you, when it comes to John Trump, the last thing I'll say around this is now we have President Trump And RFK Jr., they're both in the government and both have the deep knowledge and the deep background on a family level.
[02:17:06.860 --> 02:17:08.200]  With that UFO file.
[02:17:08.639 --> 02:17:10.600]  So there's no question about it.
[02:17:10.799 --> 02:17:13.280]  That is the biggest threat to the deep state.
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:21.760]  So the idea that we have even the hint of a threat from the skies aspect before these guys get in is absolutely telling.
[02:17:22.139 --> 02:17:29.520]  And there's no question in my mind that when we get into this Trump-Kennedy overlay, it is that connection.
[02:17:29.739 --> 02:17:33.200]  Because remember, President Kennedy came in very much like Trump did.
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:34.579]  He was independently wealthy.
[02:17:35.149 --> 02:17:37.030]  He had the connections on his own.
[02:17:37.149 --> 02:17:40.909]  He didn't need the connections of that deep state system.
[02:17:41.350 --> 02:17:47.229]  And he also had a vision of freedom, and he also had great knowledge behind the UFO file.
[02:17:47.469 --> 02:17:55.610]  It's funny because I mentioned Secretary Forrestal, who had taken Kennedy under his wing and shared this information with him.
[02:17:55.709 --> 02:18:00.670]  Well, there's a number of different aspects when it comes to Kennedy and Trump that overlap in this department.
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:02.719]  That's the nature of the trouble.
[02:18:02.959 --> 02:18:12.100]  And I know that there have been a lot of speculations about the JFK assassination relating to the mafia and Cubans and things of this nature.
[02:18:12.219 --> 02:18:23.500]  I just want to say, the idea of having no answer from the government 61 years later, except the ridiculous lone gunman aspect, is very important about the type of reality that we're living in.
[02:18:23.780 --> 02:18:27.399]  Because that is a fragmented, disconnected piece.
[02:18:27.659 --> 02:18:32.040]  The question is, what could be so terrible that you would hide it for 61 years?
[02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:35.940]  The answer is, this is an aerospace group.
[02:18:36.299 --> 02:18:42.239]  And their plan all along has been to control things from above with advanced technology.
[02:18:42.719 --> 02:18:46.819]  That's where you get a big response from someone like Trump with Space Force.
[02:18:47.340 --> 02:18:53.260]  And that development of that space program in the background is something Kennedy warned about.
[02:18:53.870 --> 02:19:09.530]  That's when, and the actual program was called Blue Gemini at the time, and that's when Kennedy actually sent people directly to NASA. It was Defense Secretary McNamara, and he said to him, look, go in there to NASA and say, we don't have two programs, a public one and a private one.
[02:19:09.610 --> 02:19:11.309]  We have one public space program.
[02:19:11.489 --> 02:19:16.290]  I don't know what this other thing is, but if you don't get rid of it, I'm gonna kick it back to the military.
[02:19:16.850 --> 02:19:24.290]  That's a document that came out in 2014 without a lot of fanfare, because I don't think people understood the nature of the secret space program.
[02:19:24.729 --> 02:19:28.709]  Because there's been a lot of fluff and there's been a lot of science fiction about these types of things.
[02:19:28.930 --> 02:19:35.409]  But in fact, the secret space program does exist and recalls a whistleblower.
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:38.780]  Who came forward, the NASA hacker, Gary McKinnon.
[02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:47.260]  One of the interesting things, if you go back to that story, it's from 2003, right around the time of all the incredible repression of 9-11.
[02:19:47.879 --> 02:19:56.940]  But McKinnon is very important because he is from the UK, and he hacked into NASA, and he saw a series of different files.
[02:19:57.200 --> 02:20:02.239]  And one of those files said, off-world officers' lists, and it was related to the UFO file.
[02:20:02.379 --> 02:20:10.120]  So he had a group of officers who Not astronauts, nothing we've ever heard of, but an off-world officers list.
[02:20:10.600 --> 02:20:11.659]  So it was very interesting.
[02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:13.180]  The United States said, we want to get him.
[02:20:13.219 --> 02:20:14.299]  We want to extradite this guy.
[02:20:14.500 --> 02:20:21.020]  And there's actually a very famous press conference of Prime Minister Cameron with President Obama.
[02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:22.340]  And it gets brought up.
[02:20:22.739 --> 02:20:24.620]  What's going to happen with this guy, McKinnon?
[02:20:25.579 --> 02:20:26.819]  What are you going to do with him?
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:30.600]  And Obama is like, we'll go through the right channels, but we're going to get this guy.
[02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:32.760]  And it was very much an Assange situation.
[02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:34.180]  They didn't end up getting him.
[02:20:36.430 --> 02:20:40.530]  As a result of Asperger's, they weren't able to extradite him.
[02:20:40.590 --> 02:20:43.629]  So it's just a fluke that they didn't get their hands on him, but they wanted to.
[02:20:44.059 --> 02:20:51.200]  This guy released something which is a very major secret inside of the national security state, and that was the secret space program.
[02:20:51.440 --> 02:21:04.760]  This private development of space completely off the books, a part of a black budget program, is a crucial missing aspect in our understanding of geopolitics and plays directly into the continuity of government program.
[02:21:04.899 --> 02:21:10.020]  In the next segment, I'm going to go into that COG Northcom development and how we got into all this.
[02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:24.450]  I also want to say that These developments around the public airing of the whole UAP thing in Congress are very controlled and don't give us the real story around the UFO file at all.
[02:21:24.690 --> 02:21:29.889]  As a matter of fact, you have a lot of Congress people sort of hanging out there who don't know anything about the subject.
[02:21:30.270 --> 02:21:31.629]  That's the nature of the problem.
[02:21:31.829 --> 02:21:40.930]  And then they can have these counterintelligence agents come in and just flim-flam them with every kind of different story and saying, I have 30 whistleblowers over here, 40 guys over there.
[02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:48.700]  But in fact, when you dig into the history of the people who were supposedly the whistleblowers, they're still counterintelligence agents working for the government.
[02:21:48.940 --> 02:21:50.459]  This is the nature of the problem.
[02:21:50.680 --> 02:22:00.180]  That aspect, if the right transparency is brought to it, will be a complete upheaval, a gigantic volcano in the middle of this political situation.
[02:22:00.399 --> 02:22:01.780]  It's starting to happen.
[02:22:02.100 --> 02:22:07.299]  The word is starting to get out, but the public still only understands a fraction.
[02:22:07.680 --> 02:22:09.979]  I think?
[02:22:24.370 --> 02:22:27.729]  There was this program called Immaculate Constellation.
[02:22:27.969 --> 02:22:35.229]  Well, that program turned out to be a complete farce, but they stood up there before Congress, and Congress made a big deal out of it.
[02:22:35.309 --> 02:22:39.450]  So the CIA will make up things to mimic and caricature the real thing.
[02:22:39.610 --> 02:22:51.209]  And in the next segment, I'm gonna go into what the nature of the BLUE program is, that's the real UFO secret space program, and how that relates to all the strange things that we're seeing going on here.
[02:22:51.540 --> 02:22:55.579]  It's a pleasure to be here with the InfoWars audience for The Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:55.719 --> 02:22:58.079]  And we're going to go to commercial when we come back.
[02:22:58.360 --> 02:23:00.579]  Northcom, Northcom, and more Northcom.
[02:23:01.159 --> 02:23:03.379]  And I'm very much looking forward to it.
[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:06.319]  Of course, I put together some images up there.
[02:23:11.500 --> 02:23:24.219]  Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow patriots, it's December 2024, and that means it's Christmas at InfoWars, and our big president, President Trump, about to be in office in just a few weeks.
[02:23:24.360 --> 02:23:29.200]  Now, let me show you some of the amazing designs that are limited edition right now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:23:29.399 --> 02:23:30.260]  Talk about fun.
[02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:32.540]  Talk about a conversation piece.
[02:23:32.680 --> 02:23:36.180]  Talk about a way to trigger liberals and find fellow patriots on the streets.
[02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:42.620]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the Alex Jones Rampant Christmas Sweater.
[02:23:42.739 --> 02:23:46.239]  Ah, then of course there's the Darth Sidious Hoodies.
[02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:48.420]  Trump one, I'm afraid.
[02:23:49.229 --> 02:23:53.870]  Now, out of the hundreds of amazing designs at theologshownstore.com, I knew this would be popular.
[02:23:53.989 --> 02:23:55.870]  It turns out it is one of the top five bestsellers.
[02:23:56.129 --> 02:23:59.229]  Trump, 2024. Better coverage than Verizon.
[02:23:59.270 --> 02:24:00.649]  Can you hear us now?
[02:24:00.850 --> 02:24:03.930]  And theologshownstore.com has brought back a fan favorite.
[02:24:03.989 --> 02:24:06.090]  We haven't had this shirt for five, six, seven years.
[02:24:06.250 --> 02:24:09.670]  It's the classic InfoWars because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:14.729]  And then we've got the alchemy of the deadly chemical accuracy bending our genders and the frogs' genders.
[02:24:14.909 --> 02:24:17.430]  The frogs go through the prism and they come out.
[02:24:17.530 --> 02:24:18.889]  Well, you know the rest of the story.
[02:24:19.250 --> 02:24:25.590]  And who can forget the chart that saved President Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania when he turned his head on the right wing of the chart?
[02:24:26.170 --> 02:24:27.270]  Everybody's got to get one of these.
[02:24:27.469 --> 02:24:28.770]  I predict it'll be a bestseller.
[02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:32.649]  Donald Trump reborn as a Jack Daniels bottle.
[02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:34.430]  This is going to be a bestseller as well.
[02:24:34.549 --> 02:24:36.649]  If you're blown away by these designs, it's just a few of them.
[02:24:36.829 --> 02:24:39.790]  There's over 200 designs right now at theauctionstore.com.
[02:24:40.110 --> 02:24:41.709]  Get them, spread the word, and keep us on the air.
[02:24:41.889 --> 02:24:42.750]  God bless you all.
[02:24:42.750 --> 02:24:43.690]  Have a wonderful Christmas.
[02:24:46.219 --> 02:24:47.219]  Ho ho ho!
[02:24:47.540 --> 02:24:48.879]  Merry Christmas!
[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:16.959]  I've got a question and also a comment here for dark journalist Daniel List.
[02:25:17.459 --> 02:25:20.799]  Daniel, you nailed it about this being a War of the Worlds 2.0.
[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:23.200]  Psychological operation.
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:33.299]  And after we did our shows and after I issued an emergency warning to Trump to get a briefing on this and find out that it indeed was the Pentagon under Biden's orders, that they would start backing off the hysteria real quick.
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:38.879]  And as soon as Trump did that, we saw Kirby from the Pentagon and we saw Biden and others come out and say, okay, this is no big deal.
[02:25:38.959 --> 02:25:39.600]  We know who they are.
[02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:40.420]  We know where they're coming from.
[02:25:40.659 --> 02:25:41.500]  They're not dangerous.
[02:25:41.719 --> 02:25:45.879]  When they had said, we don't know where they're coming from, but it's not foreign governments, but it's not us, but it's not dangerous.
[02:25:46.159 --> 02:25:55.479]  We really saw about a 170, not a pure 180 on that, because they never answered Okay, well, you don't know who they are, but now you do know who they are, but they're not a threat.
[02:25:55.860 --> 02:25:58.360]  Well, then why are they harassing U.S. military bases?
[02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:02.180]  That's clear compartmentalization, so there's a bigger story there.
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:10.120]  But just notice that since we really exposed this, the fact that you don't use drones to snoop for radiation, that's ground-based systems, are the best.
[02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:20.500]  And since all the experts came out and agreed with that, they've now kind of pulled back on this, at least for now, and have moved on to the new pandemic and the declarations of emergency and all the rest of it.
[02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:27.120]  It's also in their different WEF globalist documents, how they use viruses and the threat of viruses to bring in their global corporate government.
[02:26:28.329 --> 02:26:36.649]  My big question is, how big was it when Trump came out and called their bluff last week and then earlier this week?
[02:26:36.809 --> 02:26:40.069]  And what do you expect the deep state and the different factions to do now?
[02:26:40.709 --> 02:26:49.870]  And just your response to how amazing it was, in my opinion, when they did that 170 just as soon as Trump came out and called them on their crap.
[02:26:50.030 --> 02:26:50.229]  Thanks.
[02:26:53.090 --> 02:26:54.770]  Wow, an excellent question.
[02:26:55.209 --> 02:27:09.809]  And I have to say that Alex nailed it there, which is there was a huge tone shift as soon as President-elect Trump came out and said, the government knows exactly where these things are, where they're being launched from, and they were returning to.
[02:27:10.270 --> 02:27:13.409]  And he said, I can't imagine it could be the enemy.
[02:27:13.649 --> 02:27:21.629]  So therefore, it pointed it directly back to the government itself as being the ones who were launching this.
[02:27:21.940 --> 02:27:28.399]  Now, I think that there was a lot of data mining taking place in the advent of the first few weeks of this.
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:37.399]  However, a story that goes all the way back to December of 2023 came out in the Wall Street Journal as late as November of this year.
[02:27:37.420 --> 02:27:41.159]  And it was all about how these drones had swarmed for days.
[02:27:45.130 --> 02:27:58.629]  We're good to go.
[02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:08.799]  I think we're good to go.
[02:28:22.370 --> 02:28:23.770]  Yeah.
[02:28:43.450 --> 02:28:55.389]  So suddenly, you saw the guys at the top of Space Force and the guys at the top of NORTHCOM, and they all had this signature in their background of having this background of closely associated with the UFO file.
[02:28:55.569 --> 02:28:57.729]  And it also goes for General Guillo.
[02:28:58.010 --> 02:29:05.149]  In Guillo's case, he has addressed the UAP thing saying, oh, there are thousands of incursions at our border every year.
[02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:06.649]  Well, that seems quite extraordinary.
[02:29:06.649 --> 02:29:11.690]  I guess NORAD or NORTHCOM isn't doing their job if there's thousands of incursions.
[02:29:12.609 --> 02:29:22.270]  We also have to remember this takes place under this umbrella of a kind of a fantasy that NORAD doesn't know is flying in the skies, just like with the Chinese balloon.
[02:29:22.850 --> 02:29:28.809]  And General Van Herc with the 509th Roswell connection was in charge at that point.
[02:29:28.850 --> 02:29:32.629]  And he rambled up to the microphone and said, well, it could be extraterrestrial.
[02:29:32.629 --> 02:29:33.709]  We just don't know.
[02:29:34.049 --> 02:29:37.030]  That was, again, setting in these subconscious layers.
[02:29:37.309 --> 02:29:42.989]  And he put that out there on purpose, and all the newspapers picked up at the time, all the websites, everything picked up.
[02:29:43.270 --> 02:29:49.270]  This is what the NORTHCOM commander had to say, that this could be extraterrestrial.
[02:29:49.549 --> 02:29:53.149]  And it's very easy for him to dance with that statement and say, well, it could be.
[02:29:53.229 --> 02:29:54.329]  Well, it could be anything, right?
[02:29:55.270 --> 02:30:00.149]  But this idea that they're suddenly just discovering how to look at balloons or drones is ridiculous.
[02:30:00.430 --> 02:30:09.770]  We've had the most sophisticated air defense system anywhere, ever, especially since World War II. This idea that balloons could get away with floating in our skies.
[02:30:09.989 --> 02:30:15.729]  Well, there are military laws on the books that don't allow balloons anywhere near the coast of the United States.
[02:30:15.889 --> 02:30:23.190]  And that dates back to the Japanese floating over poisonous bombs and actually killing people in the Pacific Northwest.
[02:30:23.850 --> 02:30:25.629]  So they have rules against that already.
[02:30:25.809 --> 02:30:29.170]  They don't need to adjust their sensors so they can start to see things.
[02:30:29.629 --> 02:30:33.790]  This entire structure was set up to fight a nuclear war.
[02:30:33.969 --> 02:30:36.649]  Do you think they're going to let things in their skies that they don't know what they are?
[02:30:36.909 --> 02:30:44.840]  Especially something like a drone, which has the capacity of the size of twice an SUV. No.
[02:30:45.020 --> 02:30:46.260]  So this is all fantasy stuff.
[02:30:46.280 --> 02:30:54.719]  And when Kirby comes up to the microphone and says, oh, there's nothing illegal going on, those are all very, very gaslighting statements.
[02:30:54.719 --> 02:30:59.120]  But they show you a kind of level of danger involved in this.
[02:30:59.239 --> 02:31:11.299]  And it's very interesting because now what we have more than them flying over regular metropolitan areas like they were doing heavily for three or four weeks, now what you have is specifically military bases.
[02:31:12.149 --> 02:31:16.510]  So they just, over Dallas, there was one mysterious drones reported.
[02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:21.729]  This story just came out this morning over a major military base there.
[02:31:22.030 --> 02:31:28.549]  When we look at these different incursions over time, they would never be allowed, but here they are, you know, swarming around.
[02:31:29.479 --> 02:31:37.600]  There's a very interesting genesis when you get back on this, which is there are a series of nuclear bases that had UFO incidents.
[02:31:37.739 --> 02:31:41.760]  And this goes back 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, you name it.
[02:31:42.040 --> 02:31:48.319]  And the ability of the UFOs to turn off the missiles is on record.
[02:31:48.319 --> 02:31:51.799]  And a number of the people who worked at the bases have come out about this.
[02:31:52.000 --> 02:32:01.020]  In fact, it is a general chance they're From the Space Force, the commander of the Space Force, who was at one of these bases for five years.
[02:32:01.159 --> 02:32:04.319]  He worked at that Montana base where this took place.
[02:32:04.639 --> 02:32:16.379]  So when we first got the first reports around the Chinese balloons and the things that were happening there, that was all related again to Montana.
[02:32:16.799 --> 02:32:19.200]  And so Montana was a central piece of this.
[02:32:19.319 --> 02:32:22.899]  Montana and Oregon We're good to go.
[02:32:49.989 --> 02:32:53.889]  To the CIA director, John McCone at the time, because he had fired Dulles.
[02:32:54.049 --> 02:33:03.790]  And he said, what I want you to do is share with me all the high threat UFO cases because I want to prepare to share them with Khrushchev, the leader of the Russians.
[02:33:04.270 --> 02:33:09.610]  And at that point, you can see that this is the bridge too far with President Kennedy.
[02:33:10.110 --> 02:33:24.309]  But there's a strange crisscross here with our deep state and what goes on around the UFO file because whenever our leaders get around the situation where they want to deal with the Russians one-on-one about the UFO file, they run into all kinds of strange obstacles.
[02:33:24.809 --> 02:33:29.670]  And that tells us a great deal about the groups that are stopping them from getting together.
[02:33:30.030 --> 02:33:34.469]  Never mind our antagonisms with Russia or whatever it happens to be.
[02:33:34.770 --> 02:33:37.350]  Those leaders getting together is a crucial thing.
[02:33:37.489 --> 02:33:43.209]  So if Trump and Putin can sit down and work this out, well, they can work out a number of things on the world stage.
[02:33:43.370 --> 02:33:51.850]  However, if they get together and they talk about the UFO file, that deep state structure goes bananas because they're losing that control over it.
[02:33:51.930 --> 02:33:54.190]  So you'll notice there's a series of different...
[02:34:03.479 --> 02:34:19.799]  And in Reagan's case, when he was there with Gorbachev, Gorbachev tells the story in 2014 at the New York Press Club that Reagan sits him down, looks straight in his eyes and says, there's a UFO threat.
[02:34:19.799 --> 02:34:22.239]  If they attack us, will you help us?
[02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:24.860]  And Gorbachev said he was absolutely serious.
[02:34:25.340 --> 02:34:37.899]  And the people in the room who were State Department officials and Charlie Rose, people like that, are absolutely gobsmacked when Chairman Gorbachev says this.
[02:34:38.299 --> 02:34:41.340]  Gorbachev went on the record with it because he knew it was crucial.
[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:48.280]  Because they decided at a point in the 1980s to have this SDI Star Wars defense in America.
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:52.840]  And they needed to explain it to the Russians as, no, this isn't something where we're going to come and bomb you.
[02:34:52.940 --> 02:34:55.000]  This is our UFO defense system.
[02:34:55.389 --> 02:35:06.229]  Now it's interesting because President Trump has talked about installing a missile shield exactly like SDI because in Reagan's era they couldn't do it.
[02:35:06.860 --> 02:35:20.780]  In fact, they did have some successes with this in the Reagan era, and Reagan himself was taken aside by a deep black project scientist named Norm Berggren, who wrote a book called The Ringmakers of Saturn.
[02:35:20.959 --> 02:35:26.360]  And they showed him various video of these craft hovering in the rings of Saturn.
[02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:35.260]  And once they showed him that, then Reagan starts peppering all of his speeches with, we need to get together because there's an alien threat, how much that would unite us and all the rest.
[02:35:35.479 --> 02:35:50.379]  If you look into Colin Powell's autobiography when he's talking about working with Reagan, he says, you know, the amount of times I was the guy who rubbed out and erased all those comments that Reagan made about the UFO file and aliens during these speeches, and I missed that one.
[02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:54.680]  So he sort of chides himself on the book for missing that particular thing.
[02:35:55.329 --> 02:36:12.569]  There's another famous incident, of course, with Reagan, which I always found fascinating when he's sitting there with Steven Spielberg in the White House, and Spielberg shows him the movie E.T., and then Reagan stands up afterwards after everyone's seen the debut of this movie and says, we all know in this room that this is not fiction.
[02:36:12.750 --> 02:36:13.909]  This is real life.
[02:36:14.290 --> 02:36:33.229]  So Reagan was very clued in on this, but I think what they did on the CIA side is they profiled him As they had profiled other presidents before him and said, you know, this guy, we need to give him the, it's for America, that these things are a threat and we need to build up the secret program in the background.
[02:36:33.610 --> 02:36:37.329]  That gave them the ability to create a secret space program.
[02:36:37.709 --> 02:37:00.510]  And Kennedy's program, which was still surviving through the Challenger, We're good to go.
[02:37:11.470 --> 02:37:14.290]  And all that takes us into Artemis.
[02:37:14.610 --> 02:37:19.209]  And Artemis is the program that NASA is launching to put people back on the moon.
[02:37:19.870 --> 02:37:21.729]  Well, hey, it's 52 years later.
[02:37:21.729 --> 02:37:22.610]  What did you do in between?
[02:37:22.610 --> 02:37:23.829]  What was going on?
[02:37:24.270 --> 02:37:28.469]  And I always hear, whenever there's historical breakdowns of this, they're terrible.
[02:37:28.690 --> 02:37:34.770]  You know, the Neil deGrasse Tyson types are just completely uninformed on it, or they've been fed pablum.
[02:37:34.850 --> 02:37:38.530]  But what happens is, they'll say, well, they didn't have the money for it.
[02:37:38.549 --> 02:37:40.430]  Look, look into the history of Apollo.
[02:37:40.690 --> 02:37:44.030]  The next three missions all through 1976 were paid for.
[02:37:44.129 --> 02:37:45.049]  They were already funded.
[02:37:45.229 --> 02:37:53.309]  They already had spent the money on the personnel, built up the apparatus for it, and they were going to the moon regularly at that point.
[02:37:53.469 --> 02:37:57.170]  So when we think about this, those explanations don't make any sense.
[02:37:57.290 --> 02:37:58.629]  So what happened to the space program?
[02:37:58.790 --> 02:38:01.170]  It went into a covert space program.
[02:38:01.409 --> 02:38:03.909]  That's what the whole SSP aspect is.
[02:38:04.049 --> 02:38:06.530]  And then you got these guys privatizing.
[02:38:07.500 --> 02:38:11.299]  And Bigelow Aerospace was a major piece of this.
[02:38:11.459 --> 02:38:18.360]  And it's very interesting because Bigelow is sort of like a space trump in a way because he's a guy who has all these hotels and things.
[02:38:18.459 --> 02:38:21.000]  He wants all of this tourist spots in space.
[02:38:22.500 --> 02:38:29.040]  But he's also right in the heart of Las Vegas and his organization is majorly involved in the political scene.
[02:38:29.139 --> 02:38:36.889]  He was one of the top funders In the 2024 Republican primaries, and he was funding DeSantis from Florida.
[02:38:37.290 --> 02:38:39.409]  So these people move.
[02:38:39.549 --> 02:38:47.430]  There's UFO money throughout the political system, and the more we put those things together, the more we're going to get a clearer vision of the truth.
[02:38:48.049 --> 02:38:57.309]  I always say one of the major problems is that the people who understand the deep state don't understand the UFOphile because they regard them all as fringe or whatever they happen to be.
[02:38:57.469 --> 02:39:02.229]  And the UFOphile people don't know how to research on the level that the deep state people do.
[02:39:02.370 --> 02:39:05.950]  The deep state people understand government assassinations.
[02:39:05.950 --> 02:39:08.129]  They understand the background on these things.
[02:39:08.290 --> 02:39:11.030]  They know how to look at the various geopolitical influences.
[02:39:11.729 --> 02:39:17.170]  And that's something that the UFO... What researchers don't know how to do.
[02:39:17.370 --> 02:39:18.829]  They're just lacking in that one regard.
[02:39:19.270 --> 02:39:22.950]  But I would say this, that the UFO researchers have one huge advantage.
[02:39:23.190 --> 02:39:24.829]  They know there's a UFO file.
[02:39:25.450 --> 02:39:27.290]  And that is the breakaway technology.
[02:39:27.290 --> 02:39:30.690]  It's the X technology sitting in the middle of all this.
[02:39:30.829 --> 02:39:32.549]  There's a reason why it's called SpaceX.
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:38.680]  By the way, because this whole definition of X came about through Guy Bannister.
[02:39:39.059 --> 02:39:48.819]  And Bannister, in fact, was the person who worked in the FBI hunting down all those cases in the Pacific Northwest of crafts that had crashed down.
[02:39:49.299 --> 02:40:00.239]  So it's a weird thing when you see the overlays of history because Bannister shows up very deep in the UFO file later around the JFK assassination, and he's running Lee Harvey Oswald in New Orleans.
[02:40:00.500 --> 02:40:01.959]  So it's very interesting.
[02:40:01.979 --> 02:40:14.420]  If you go into the history of people like Jim Garrison and others who prosecuted the JFK assassination, they're looking at some of these people and they're saying, what is this about NASA and the UFO file that has anything to do with this case?
[02:40:14.559 --> 02:40:15.719]  They don't understand it.
[02:40:16.030 --> 02:40:18.250]  And they start to get suspicious after a while.
[02:40:18.469 --> 02:40:19.229]  And it's very interesting.
[02:40:19.370 --> 02:40:33.389]  If you read some of the bios around Jim Garrison, his ultimate conclusion that it was the aerospace wing of the military industrial complex that took out Kennedy and for the reason of they were protecting something.
[02:40:33.709 --> 02:40:37.350]  And the thing that they were protecting is this exotic technology piece.
[02:40:37.450 --> 02:40:39.450]  And I tell you, we haven't moved the needle one bit.
[02:40:39.879 --> 02:40:50.440]  From those 61 years between the Kennedy assassination, other deep events like Watergate, Iran-Contra, and Northcom's takeover after 9-11.
[02:40:50.659 --> 02:40:55.020]  We're still behind this secrecy, this wall of secrecy.
[02:40:55.139 --> 02:40:58.340]  That wall of secrecy is not cracked, except on a few occasions.
[02:40:58.340 --> 02:41:12.750]  And I think, again, that that handshake between Kennedy Yeah, I think that's what I'm saying.
[02:41:13.149 --> 02:41:14.170]  Then this is dramatic.
[02:41:14.370 --> 02:41:23.930]  And I do want to say this on the historical record in terms of JFK. A lot of people have said to me, well, look, you know, the CIA would never leave anything that's incriminating to them in their own records.
[02:41:24.069 --> 02:41:26.149]  Come on, you know, those records don't mean anything.
[02:41:26.590 --> 02:41:29.170]  No, there's a reason that they've sat on those records.
[02:41:29.309 --> 02:41:42.129]  I'm going to tell you what it is, which is the records in the Kennedy case were originally handled and set up four hours after the assassination by Robert Kennedy, the attorney general.
[02:41:42.530 --> 02:41:43.389]  This is crucial.
[02:41:43.610 --> 02:41:50.510]  He called John McCone in to meet him at a farm in Virginia and said, I'm installing this piece into your reporting on it.
[02:41:50.569 --> 02:41:54.389]  If it ever comes out, it's gonna ring all these bells and whistles off in the Justice Department.
[02:41:54.729 --> 02:41:57.930]  So there's something sitting in those files.
[02:41:58.149 --> 02:42:08.709]  And remember, famously, when Trump was supposed to release them in that period in 2017, October 26, which was the 25-year deadline set by Congress.
[02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:10.920]  He was not able to release them fully.
[02:42:11.020 --> 02:42:17.799]  He came out with some of the biggest, he divulged some of the biggest secret files, but he did not let them out fully.
[02:42:18.219 --> 02:42:22.040]  And part of that reason was Mike Pompeo came to him and said, you can't do this.
[02:42:22.659 --> 02:42:26.920]  The leader of the CIA. And he was giving him all these different various reasons.
[02:42:27.180 --> 02:42:28.799]  And so Trump didn't do it.
[02:42:28.879 --> 02:42:36.739]  And at the end of his administration, Judge Napolitano, of course, that libertarian judge that people know so well and has a lot of integrity.
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:39.780]  He had a relationship with Trump.
[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:41.239]  It was kind of a back and forth relationship.
[02:42:41.239 --> 02:42:44.420]  But he called him after the assassination.
[02:42:45.299 --> 02:42:49.559]  No, no, after the election loss in 2020 and said, why don't you release the records on the way out?
[02:42:49.620 --> 02:42:50.260]  You said you would.
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:52.719]  And Trump said, no, I can't do it.
[02:42:53.100 --> 02:42:53.959]  I can't do it.
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:58.299]  And Napolitano, the way he tells it, it's very interesting.
[02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:01.100]  And this is something we've highlighted on my show.
[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:02.579]  He said, well, why not?
[02:43:02.659 --> 02:43:04.540]  You can't treat the American public like children.
[02:43:04.620 --> 02:43:05.719]  Why wouldn't you let this out?
[02:43:05.819 --> 02:43:06.280]  It's crucial.
[02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:08.840]  The assassination of a president, it's 60 years later.
[02:43:09.260 --> 02:43:11.920]  And Trump said, Andrew, you don't understand.
[02:43:12.139 --> 02:43:15.920]  If you saw what was in those files, you couldn't let them out either.
[02:43:16.379 --> 02:43:16.959]  Do you understand?
[02:43:19.789 --> 02:43:22.149]  Napolitano said, I don't know what it was.
[02:43:22.430 --> 02:43:28.430]  And Trump also said, I'll tell you at some point, but not when there's 30 people listening to me like there are in this phone call right now.
[02:43:29.629 --> 02:43:30.690]  So Trump knew.
[02:43:30.870 --> 02:43:35.629]  He understood that there's a deep state secret hanging there deep in the background.
[02:43:35.629 --> 02:43:45.530]  He may have even used it as a card in some of his deep state poker matches that have gone on here, including them trying to land him in prison, kill him, or otherwise.
[02:43:46.020 --> 02:43:55.399]  One of the other things I want to mention about the deep state activities is I consider it a deep event, the raid on Mar-a-Lago and the things that they were looking for.
[02:43:56.440 --> 02:44:07.479]  Now, there are these stories back there that one of the things that they sent John Trump in was to get this actual device, advanced device that Tesla had developed.
[02:44:07.799 --> 02:44:16.559]  And the way that John Trump tells it at the end of his life in one of his own video And I have about 12 hours of video of him.
[02:44:17.100 --> 02:44:21.540]  What he says is, well, the FBI, they weren't looking for a death ray, actually.
[02:44:21.780 --> 02:44:30.719]  What they sent me in there for, they were looking for an object, a device that Tesla had created, which took down flying objects at a distance.
[02:44:31.440 --> 02:44:38.579]  So when we think about this and think about the whole thing about unidentified flying objects, this was in fact kind of the UFO killer.
[02:44:39.329 --> 02:44:53.709]  And that's the thing that they wanted because they were already being bedeviled by the whole aspect of the UFO file, both the UFO file on the inside and then this other stuff that they're looking at on the outside that they don't know what it is or how to deal with it.
[02:44:53.969 --> 02:45:03.909]  And again, when you're dealing with the UFO file, you could be dealing with an extraterritorial group, a group that's developed this technology here, or you could be dealing with something off-world.
[02:45:04.530 --> 02:45:13.969]  Or you could be dealing directly with this breakaway pattern inside the government that has some kind of quasi-corporate political move.
[02:45:14.090 --> 02:45:19.950]  You have to look to those sources, and you can't get locked in too dramatically to any particular thing.
[02:45:20.030 --> 02:45:22.770]  Once in a while, I hear people say, well, it's not aliens.
[02:45:22.770 --> 02:45:23.549]  It's just all us.
[02:45:23.649 --> 02:45:24.870]  It's the government trying to scare people.
[02:45:25.129 --> 02:45:30.290]  Well, the government is aware more than anyone about the UFO file.
[02:45:30.510 --> 02:45:33.889]  They've been collecting that data for, I think, 100 years at least.
[02:45:34.430 --> 02:45:38.110]  And the information goes back all the way into our own ancient history.
[02:45:38.290 --> 02:45:40.290]  This is a major, major problem.
[02:45:40.290 --> 02:45:55.149]  And the idea of handing over the reins of the human origin story, as it were, to the Central Intelligence Agency or DARPA or people of this ilk is not a good, healthy idea because they will just spin it out as their version of history.
[02:45:55.149 --> 02:45:59.030]  And this gets us into a deep, deep aspect around all this.
[02:45:59.270 --> 02:46:04.309]  Which I'll get into in the next segment, which is how old and how advanced is the technology?
[02:46:04.829 --> 02:46:19.190]  And I'll ask the guys here to show a couple of the things that I posted up on my X account, which are interesting graphics that might give us some idea of what it is exactly that we're talking about in relation to the UFO file.
[02:46:19.309 --> 02:46:27.309]  Of course, you're watching us Here on InfoWars, and this is Daniel List from The Dark Journalist here, speaking to you on The Alex Jones Show.
[02:46:27.430 --> 02:46:35.110]  A great honor to be here, and of course, I highly recommend everyone's support, Alex Jones and his mission here.
[02:46:35.250 --> 02:46:47.250]  I've always considered Alex a great architect of independent media, and now so much of that independent media has become part of the mainstream, although they've been fighting it and trying to co-opt it in different ways.
[02:46:47.610 --> 02:46:59.370]  And, you know, there's great voices out there around all of this, like Joe Rogan or Tucker Carlson or whatever, but Alex has been there doing it the longest, and he really is the architect of all this.
[02:46:59.770 --> 02:47:04.809]  Get behind him and get behind the work, especially since his work has been so persecuted.
[02:47:05.370 --> 02:47:10.270]  There, Exhibit 1, I've got, I think, 15 different ones up there.
[02:47:10.370 --> 02:47:11.329]  This one's very important.
[02:47:12.020 --> 02:47:18.200]  That is actually NorthCom headquarters, which right in Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado.
[02:47:18.700 --> 02:47:27.979]  And it's very interesting because you have a piece, one of the beams of 9-11 of the Twin Towers right there and around it.
[02:47:28.139 --> 02:47:29.120]  It's very interesting.
[02:47:29.379 --> 02:47:31.500]  It's one of the beams going through a globe.
[02:47:32.819 --> 02:47:45.920]  Interesting imagery that they put together here, and the fact that they merged NORTHCOM in with all their space operations and NORAD and all that, all comes out of the 2002 Cheney-Bush aspect.
[02:47:46.260 --> 02:47:51.899]  This was the ultimate goal that they had after all, which was controlling things on the ground from space.
[02:47:52.360 --> 02:48:16.280]  And the vehicle, as it were, the destruction during 9-11 gave them the ability to create NORTHCOM. NORTHCOM gave them the ability to create a COG combatant commander who would hold the reins of NORAD, NORTHCOM, and COG. That's the big play if you go back in that history and you look at the piece along here because we look at Rumsfeld as well.
[02:48:16.420 --> 02:48:21.719]  And his big obsession was developing a weapons platform in space that could deliver weapons here.
[02:48:22.219 --> 02:48:33.040]  With pinpoint accuracy, and that included the so-called Rods of God technology, which can deliver incredible devastation and leave no after effects, no fallout.
[02:48:33.159 --> 02:48:33.879]  This is crucial.
[02:48:34.639 --> 02:48:37.600]  For how they do things and how we look at all of this.
[02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:42.159]  Now, I hope that a nuclear weapon or rods of God or whatever it happens to be never gets used.
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:49.600]  But I think it's important for us to understand the stakes and the potential blackmail that goes on in relation to this.
[02:48:50.020 --> 02:49:04.569]  And one of the things that we know between Russia and NORTHCOM, there is this kind of push-pull because Russia itself, with its great satellite technology, They know a great deal about what took place, for example, during 9-11.
[02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:08.829]  And we're going to get into that in the second half of the program here coming up.
[02:49:09.010 --> 02:49:11.329]  It's great to be here with you on InfoWars.
[02:49:11.530 --> 02:49:14.209]  And again, we're going to have a great time in the next half hour.
[02:49:14.659 --> 02:49:20.219]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting to stop World War III. We are battling to get Trump into office.
[02:49:20.379 --> 02:49:21.659]  He's only president-elect right now.
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:23.559]  We are exposing the globalists.
[02:49:23.659 --> 02:49:26.600]  We are reaching 60, 70, 80 million people a day.
[02:49:26.739 --> 02:49:28.500]  We're back in the Infowars studios.
[02:49:28.799 --> 02:49:30.840]  The purchase was fraudulent.
[02:49:31.219 --> 02:49:33.340]  There's emergency hearings in court coming up next week.
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:39.180]  But regardless, I'm gonna stay on air at the Alex Jones Network even if this shuts down.
[02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:44.639]  So when you go to our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, that's not owned by me.

[02:49:53.340 --> 02:49:56.700]  They will not get the Alex Jones Network because I don't own it.

[02:50:20.770 --> 02:50:21.469]  It's insane.
[02:50:21.610 --> 02:50:23.209]  Get that and other supplements and then...
[02:50:23.629 --> 02:50:27.290]  There's over 200 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies now there.
[02:50:27.450 --> 02:50:33.809]  These folks that own it bigly were already one of the top producers of Trump and Patriot gear.
[02:50:33.909 --> 02:50:34.750]  They had the best designs.
[02:50:35.170 --> 02:50:36.889]  All of the new Trump One gear.
[02:50:36.969 --> 02:50:39.370]  There's more than 40 shirts and hoodies and ball caps there.
[02:50:39.729 --> 02:50:41.010]  These designs are incredible.

[02:50:47.590 --> 02:50:48.170]  Here they are.
[02:50:48.389 --> 02:50:49.129]  Look at this one.
[02:50:49.290 --> 02:50:53.190]  That famous meme of me coming out of the tunnel with all the Alex Jones clones.
[02:50:53.450 --> 02:50:55.229]  We are all Alex Jones.
[02:50:55.389 --> 02:50:56.389]  You've got to get that.

[02:50:59.030 --> 02:50:59.649]  Oh my goodness.
[02:51:00.069 --> 02:51:03.270]  What a way to wake folks up about all the poison in the water that's now mainstream news.
[02:51:03.829 --> 02:51:06.670]  1984 is not an instruction manual.
[02:51:07.090 --> 02:51:08.290]  Team Humanity.
[02:51:08.510 --> 02:51:09.969]  Oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[02:51:10.090 --> 02:51:12.309]  Launched that over a year ago with Elon Musk.
[02:51:12.469 --> 02:51:14.229]  And then, Dale Grebel.
[02:51:14.639 --> 02:51:19.860]  Oh, warns you about the government was right the whole time.
[02:51:20.260 --> 02:51:21.200]  Darkest Hour.
[02:51:21.459 --> 02:51:22.680]  Me is Winston Churchill.
[02:51:22.940 --> 02:51:27.780]  And so much more at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:51:27.840 --> 02:51:29.920]  Now, we don't make a ton off the t-shirts.
[02:51:30.489 --> 02:51:35.309]  We don't make a ton off the supplements because there's not a lot of markup in those, but we do sell a lot.
[02:51:35.450 --> 02:51:47.930]  But where we do get major funds is the marked up classic Alex Jones Infowars red on navy blue shirt and a few other fundraiser shirts that aren't 25 or 30 bucks, they're 50, so we get real money in.
[02:51:47.989 --> 02:51:51.649]  Because these t-shirts are high quality, printed right here in Arkansas in the United States.
[02:51:52.079 --> 02:51:55.399]  And so an extra, extra, extra large is like $16, $17.
[02:51:55.700 --> 02:51:56.719]  A small is like $15.
[02:51:56.940 --> 02:51:58.059]  The printing costs money.
[02:51:58.200 --> 02:51:59.479]  The sponsor gets part of the money.
[02:51:59.600 --> 02:52:00.819]  We get part of it to operate.
[02:52:01.440 --> 02:52:04.020]  We're making like $6, $7 on the average t-shirt, which is great.
[02:52:04.159 --> 02:52:05.000]  And they spread the word.
[02:52:05.120 --> 02:52:05.760]  You meet like-minded people.
[02:52:05.860 --> 02:52:12.139]  But when you get the marked-up shirts, only two of them are marked up to $50, we get some real money in to the operation.
[02:52:12.219 --> 02:52:15.399]  So if you really want to support, get the fundraiser shirts.
[02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:26.420]  Also, The posters, limited edition, back-to-back-to-back Trump win, all those are marked up where they cost us six, seven bucks to print them and to put it in the tube.
[02:52:26.579 --> 02:52:29.020]  So we make like 40-something bucks off that.

[02:52:47.649 --> 02:52:53.690]  We have put all the stuff they did and the bid rigging and everything in these lawsuits and court filings.
[02:52:53.969 --> 02:52:55.170]  We're going to win this thing.
[02:52:55.290 --> 02:52:58.909]  But regardless, we've got to have money to continue to fight them and stay on air.

[02:53:11.290 --> 02:53:12.489]  Thank you so much for your support.
[02:53:14.149 --> 02:53:14.590]  Hi, everyone.
[02:53:14.670 --> 02:53:20.489]  It's great to be back with you here on Infowars and for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:20.569 --> 02:53:21.209]  Just fantastic.
[02:53:21.590 --> 02:53:27.610]  We're going deep, deep now into the UFO file in a way that you don't hear anywhere, even in independent media.
[02:53:27.809 --> 02:53:35.930]  This is deep, and you're learning about what could be in relation to the UFO file and the continuity of government program.
[02:53:36.129 --> 02:53:42.780]  How do those emergency powers get rolled out And the street legend name for this was always Bluebeam, as it were.
[02:53:42.840 --> 02:53:52.079]  And there are real details around Bluebeam that go back to a particular person inside the UN who was seeing them develop these scenarios.
[02:53:52.319 --> 02:53:57.360]  And I have a number of think tank documents where they game out the scenarios of what would happen if...
[02:53:57.879 --> 02:54:05.239]  We're good to go.
[02:54:14.140 --> 02:54:19.659]  This is an intergenerational wave, and we have our own relationship with these mysteries as well.
[02:54:19.780 --> 02:54:24.399]  Remember, that has nothing to do with the government and what they choose to tell us or not tell us.
[02:54:24.459 --> 02:54:29.659]  That's crucial because there's a great deal of information that independent researchers have brought forward.
[02:54:30.200 --> 02:54:32.379]  And humanity, it's an interesting thing.
[02:54:32.379 --> 02:54:50.260]  I've noticed this as well, which is, for example, if someone out there has seen a crashed craft with a dead alien in it, and he's a general somewhere, and he thinks he's keeping it super secret, On some subconscious level, we're all connected up and we all know the same thing.
[02:54:50.479 --> 02:54:58.459]  And it's very interesting if you get into some of the deeper mystical aspects around this, you know, we're all sort of plugging into these different towers.
[02:54:59.069 --> 02:55:02.770]  And we can all ping that information that they've seen as well.
[02:55:02.870 --> 02:55:07.409]  So it's not just about what the government will disclose, which very often is not the real thing.
[02:55:07.889 --> 02:55:12.770]  One of the things that I wanted to show is just how far back this goes.
[02:55:13.209 --> 02:55:19.090]  And one of the things that I posted on X, and I put it in my documentary.
[02:55:19.309 --> 02:55:26.030]  The documentary is called JFK The Final Speech, and it's all about the Antarctica UFO file and apotheum.
[02:55:27.390 --> 02:55:31.729]  One of the things that I put in there was this painting by an artist.
[02:55:33.290 --> 02:55:42.569]  Charles Delshow, he came from Germany, in fact, and he came over here to spy in the 1850s on a group called the Sonora Aero Club.
[02:55:43.110 --> 02:56:09.829]  And a group in Germany who was dealing with aeronautics early on, before the Wright brothers, before all this, put this painting, Delshow put this painting together, which was uncovered and it's been in galleries now since the 1970s, but he drew it He painted this in 1903 and right in the middle of it we can see clearly it shows amidst his drawings of these various air vehicles,
[02:56:10.049 --> 02:56:15.110]  the arrows as he called them, we see the name Trump dead center there right above that.
[02:56:15.370 --> 02:56:30.920]  And then in the right hand corner we see the number 45 and then 99. What's quite fascinating because of course Trump was the 45th president Of the United States now will be the 47th president.
[02:56:31.139 --> 02:56:40.219]  But here we have Trump, 45, in a painting from over 100 years ago by someone who was looking at the very early aspects of these aero groups.
[02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:47.239]  So the idea of this aerospace piece being connected intergenerationally is very important.
[02:56:47.500 --> 02:56:49.719]  I also would say there's a predictive aspect.
[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:59.780]  That goes on here because here we have them rolling out that they know Trump will be the 45th president and somehow related to the airship idea and aspect.
[02:57:00.100 --> 02:57:06.040]  And of course, we've had Trump who developed Space Force and now is working with SpaceX and others.
[02:57:06.200 --> 02:57:08.379]  So he's very deeply connected with that.
[02:57:08.520 --> 02:57:14.819]  But his uncle, directly now a protege of Vannevar Bush.
[02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:17.479]  And Bush was the top.
[02:57:17.829 --> 02:57:19.670]  On the UFO file, he managed it.
[02:57:19.809 --> 02:57:23.629]  So if John Trump was his protege, he knew all about the UFO file.
[02:57:23.889 --> 02:57:28.069]  There you can see the 45 and the 99 is after it.
[02:57:28.329 --> 02:57:29.729]  The 45 is clear what that means.
[02:57:29.829 --> 02:57:32.969]  The 99 opens up a greater mystery, in my opinion.
[02:57:33.510 --> 02:57:36.110]  But Trump and 45, it's undeniable.
[02:57:36.370 --> 02:57:42.469]  The various ships that they drew, it's kind of unusual fashion of painting as well.
[02:57:42.549 --> 02:57:46.750]  It's almost like Some of the stuff are things that he's seeing that he's trying to bring to light.
[02:57:46.909 --> 02:57:48.729]  And Del Shau is an unusual character.
[02:57:49.049 --> 02:57:55.930]  There's a whole group of people and authors who look into his work and are trying to sift out and bring forward that information.
[02:57:56.569 --> 02:58:00.909]  One of the things I will say about this is the next segment, we'll get deep into it.
[02:58:01.030 --> 02:58:03.049]  And we'll see you around the other side.
[02:58:03.370 --> 02:58:08.469]  Well, we're going deep, deep today to see what these emergency powers are all about, really.
[02:58:08.909 --> 02:58:10.389]  I'm Daniel List, the dark journalist.
[02:58:11.239 --> 02:58:23.260]  Going deep here with you on the Alex Jones Show, we were looking at some arrows there that were drawn by Charles Delshow predicting Trump coming in as the 45th president.
[02:58:23.420 --> 02:58:24.120]  It's quite unusual.
[02:58:24.700 --> 02:58:30.360]  There is a fascinating, and I mean fascinating, Correlation to this.
[02:58:30.500 --> 02:58:32.940]  And again, when you get around aerospace, there are these incredible predictions.
[02:58:33.299 --> 02:58:39.059]  But one of the very interesting ones comes from the father of our rocket program, Wernher von Braun.
[02:58:39.600 --> 02:58:45.020]  And in his Mars Project, which was a scientific book that he put out, there's two different ones.
[02:58:45.180 --> 02:58:47.620]  There's Project Mars and the Mars Project.
[02:58:47.989 --> 02:58:53.030]  But there are these sci-fi tales that have people going into different planets and all the rest.
[02:58:53.549 --> 02:59:04.729]  Von Braun in there indicated that when we colonized Mars, what happens is we set up something called these different leaders that take over and serve 10-year terms.
[02:59:04.930 --> 02:59:07.850]  And the leader that he referred to was called Elon.
[02:59:08.209 --> 02:59:13.090]  Now, that's in a book in 1948. From Wernher von Braun.
[02:59:13.350 --> 02:59:24.989]  And then we have this obsessed with Mars and, you know, the owner of X and SpaceX and all the rest of it, Elon Musk, with that kind of unusual name, I would say.
[02:59:25.270 --> 02:59:26.370]  How do we put that together?
[02:59:26.610 --> 02:59:29.370]  There's a predictive aspect, again, when you get around aerospace.
[02:59:29.370 --> 02:59:32.090]  You're not just dealing with nuts and bolts.
[02:59:32.090 --> 02:59:39.110]  And that's why you see people as diverse as Aleister Crowley, L. Ron Hubbard, and...
[02:59:39.879 --> 02:59:46.700]  All these different kind of occult figures over time, over and over again, they are showing up very unusually in the middle.
[02:59:46.979 --> 02:59:55.239]  And in the case of Jack Parsons, who is a student of Crowley's, who was really the original father of our rocket program.
[02:59:55.639 --> 03:00:06.540]  Parsons is setting off rockets, and he's going to, of all places, in 1932 Roswell, New Mexico, with Goddard and his different funders, setting off these rockets.
[03:00:08.270 --> 03:00:20.930]  And it's quite fascinating to me because when you look at the influence that Crowley had on him, Crowley was our master, and I mean our master, black magician in the 20th century.
[03:00:21.090 --> 03:00:22.690]  There's no getting around it.
[03:00:22.750 --> 03:00:39.129]  And the fact that Parsons was so close to him and that space was so important and the occult signature of space was so important gives us again the hint that you're dealing with something more than just this kind of, you know, Oh, how much g-force does a UFO carry?
[03:00:39.270 --> 03:00:40.290]  Those things are fascinating.
[03:00:40.450 --> 03:00:41.409]  There's no question about it.
[03:00:41.489 --> 03:00:43.590]  And they can outperform anything that we have.
[03:00:44.629 --> 03:00:45.870]  There's no question about it.
[03:00:45.989 --> 03:00:50.909]  If we recover craft along this line and we try to redevelop it, it's still kind of difficult.
[03:00:51.110 --> 03:00:53.569]  As a matter of fact, I have a picture up on Twitter.
[03:00:53.670 --> 03:00:54.610]  Maybe they can pull it up.
[03:00:54.750 --> 03:00:56.950]  That is the Kelvin UFO out of Scotland.
[03:00:57.549 --> 03:01:01.530]  This is a very important picture because it was released, and I have the negative of this.
[03:01:01.610 --> 03:01:03.110]  There's no chicanery around the picture.
[03:01:03.629 --> 03:01:18.979]  It was released by the Ministry of Defense and it was captured in 1990 and suppressed until 2022. This picture which shows a plane Tracking a huge,
[03:01:19.200 --> 03:01:22.200]  and I mean a huge UFO, is quite remarkable.
[03:01:22.500 --> 03:01:37.879]  And the story behind this that I've been able to get and glean from different whistleblowers and others is that what you're actually seeing taking place there is the plane trying to guide and direct this UFO because we still, at that point in 1990, did not have complete mastery of this technology.
[03:01:38.299 --> 03:01:47.260]  And they were trying to figure out how to fly these things without this major apotheum effect taking place, which would cause missing time and all the rest of it.
[03:01:47.489 --> 03:01:48.549]  It's quite fascinating.
[03:01:48.549 --> 03:02:00.389]  If you go into some of the original cases where there's still good info around the UFO file, you're going to find that what they had going on were these scientists going into these crashed craft at different times in history.
[03:02:00.629 --> 03:02:05.229]  And they would be experiencing very, very ill side effects.
[03:02:05.530 --> 03:02:09.629]  So they figured out you can only have a scientist in there for 20 minutes at a time.
[03:02:09.920 --> 03:02:21.940]  That's very crucial information, because what happened, if you read some of the stories, is that you actually would get scientists going in there, and not only would they get physically ill, they would start to experience a kind of otherworldliness.
[03:02:23.809 --> 03:02:28.729]  Relatives who had passed on, for example, they would experience a whole range of psychic phenomena.
[03:02:28.909 --> 03:02:35.590]  They would have beings come to them and instruct them about how they've lived their life wrongly and need to improve it and how they're going to destroy the environment.
[03:02:35.770 --> 03:02:40.510]  All these unusual things would happen to them when they're just going in there to do this kind of crash retrieval.
[03:02:40.629 --> 03:02:44.670]  So you're dealing with a totally different set and a type of technology.
[03:02:45.069 --> 03:02:52.870]  And in the background, what we've had is a secret program around setting up psychics to work around recovered UFO technology.
[03:03:05.510 --> 03:03:12.989]  And some of the best remote viewers like Ingo Swann and others, they gave us the most details about what was going on with the UFO file.
[03:03:13.430 --> 03:03:18.209]  And there's a guy from that program, Russell Targ, who's been on my show on a number of occasions.
[03:03:18.549 --> 03:03:24.690]  He set up that program and Von Braun and other psychics like Uri Geller were involved with it.
[03:03:24.870 --> 03:03:31.549]  And what happened was they had a very interesting guy who was a sheriff on the West Coast.
[03:03:31.690 --> 03:03:32.770]  His name was Pat Price.
[03:03:33.299 --> 03:03:35.700]  He's also one of the greatest psychics of all time.
[03:03:36.219 --> 03:03:42.579]  And Pat Price, what he was known to do was to look at a mug book and be able to read out which criminal did which case.
[03:03:42.700 --> 03:03:46.540]  And over and over again, they found these remarkable results that he would be correct.
[03:03:47.550 --> 03:04:03.409]  So his program, this remote viewing program, heard about him and they recruited him and he was doing all these things, including the fact that the Psychic Spies Network they developed for this remote viewing program saved a State Department diplomat by pinpointing his location so they could go and rescue him.
[03:04:03.590 --> 03:04:07.389]  I mean, this is extraordinary things that they did that we know about.
[03:04:07.610 --> 03:04:09.270]  So much of it has been held undercover.
[03:04:09.750 --> 03:04:13.989]  But Pat Price also had a Scientology connection.
[03:04:14.729 --> 03:04:23.190]  And when he was talking to his mentor in Scientology, he let things slip about his research into the UFO file.
[03:04:23.389 --> 03:04:28.409]  And they were starting to realize he had too much of a curiosity about the UFO file.
[03:04:28.549 --> 03:04:31.229]  And Pat Price turned up mysteriously dead.
[03:04:32.549 --> 03:04:47.659]  Now, it's very interesting because Stansfield Turner, who was the CIA director Carter actually churned out this very unusual quote at a certain point where he said, yes, he was asked a question about, are you using psychic remote viewers?
[03:04:48.100 --> 03:04:55.040]  And he answered very casually and said, well, apparently there's some rumor that one of the psychics died.
[03:04:55.729 --> 03:05:00.250]  And we think that he's just gone so remote in the remote viewing that we can't find him.
[03:05:00.370 --> 03:05:04.709]  It was this weird flip thing about what they'll do with the psychics who go too far.
[03:05:04.850 --> 03:05:17.829]  But they're in the background recruiting psychics on a regular basis through university programs and being able to figure out who it is that can perform these different activities with the psychic interaction with advanced craft.
[03:05:18.279 --> 03:05:23.559]  Now, that's an exotic technology, but it's something they've been working on for a great deal of time.
[03:05:23.719 --> 03:05:31.239]  And we have things about psychics, it's kind of like a pop culture piece, which is a punchline very much at times.
[03:05:31.459 --> 03:05:34.399]  But what does the deeper research look like?
[03:05:34.540 --> 03:05:46.059]  Well, if you go back and you look at some of the major forces around that, people like Edgar Cayce, for example, we still look to that information to say, how can this guy be so right over a period of time?
[03:05:46.540 --> 03:05:52.280]  Well, one of the things that the remote viewing group picked up was that Casey could do all these health readings.
[03:05:52.459 --> 03:06:00.760]  So he would pinpoint somebody, they'd give him the address, and he would float in his mind over to Miami and pinpoint this guy and diagnose him at a distance.
[03:06:01.399 --> 03:06:08.959]  So this psychic diagnosis at a distance was something that they found interesting, and so they started to develop their own program about how to do this.
[03:06:09.379 --> 03:06:22.399]  And what happened with Cayce is quite fascinating because he not only could go into the future, in his mind he could go into the past, and he would read something called the Akashic Chronicle, which holds all of the history of humanity.
[03:06:22.870 --> 03:06:26.870]  And it's very interesting with Casey because of his accuracy.
[03:06:27.190 --> 03:06:30.969]  So you might think about, well, this psychic, that psychic, whatever.
[03:06:31.190 --> 03:06:34.809]  But Casey had a demonstrated 40-year program around this.
[03:06:34.889 --> 03:06:40.309]  And this is what happens when you look at the mystery school aspect in relation to this.
[03:06:40.530 --> 03:06:52.489]  There's a point and a position, say, right around the 1920s where these groups were coming in and giving this information out because they saw the incredible things that were headed in for humanity.
[03:06:52.739 --> 03:06:57.159]  So suddenly we had all of these mystery school teachers like Rudolf Steiner.
[03:06:57.379 --> 03:07:02.440]  And it's interesting, and I had an image of what Steiner had carved.
[03:07:02.440 --> 03:07:04.020]  It's actually X-12.
[03:07:04.280 --> 03:07:08.000]  If the guys are out there paying attention, I appreciate it.
[03:07:08.420 --> 03:07:11.940]  That image could be really great to show.
[03:07:12.159 --> 03:07:13.920]  This is a very fascinating image.
[03:07:16.180 --> 03:07:20.780]  Because X-12 is a photo of Ahriman.
[03:07:20.979 --> 03:07:21.420]  There it is.
[03:07:21.479 --> 03:07:22.639]  Wow, I really appreciate it.
[03:07:23.979 --> 03:07:27.719]  And did you notice the graphics today have been fantastic, everyone?
[03:07:28.440 --> 03:07:29.639]  Give these guys a hand.
[03:07:30.180 --> 03:07:30.600]  Unbelievable.
[03:07:31.120 --> 03:07:32.239]  Well, look at this.
[03:07:33.420 --> 03:07:39.760]  This is a carving that Rudolf Steiner, who became the leader of anthroposophy – this guy was no slouch, by the way.
[03:07:39.840 --> 03:07:45.000]  He's one of the greatest geniuses that Europe ever churned out – And he developed eurythmy.
[03:07:45.120 --> 03:07:46.700]  He developed biodynamic farming.
[03:07:47.200 --> 03:07:51.959]  And he had a particular aspect, which is he could view into the future.
[03:07:52.100 --> 03:07:59.180]  And when he viewed into the 21st century, all these different people around him were saying things like, hey, humanity is going to have this wonderful future.
[03:07:59.420 --> 03:08:02.659]  Everyone's going to be in this kind of age of Aquarius type thing.
[03:08:02.879 --> 03:08:05.200]  And Steiner was like, yeah, but not so much.
[03:08:05.299 --> 03:08:06.319]  There's a problem first.
[03:08:06.719 --> 03:08:14.899]  And the problem was, in Steiner's world, this Aramonic, in his cosmology, this Aramonic force coming through technology in the 21st century.
[03:08:15.079 --> 03:08:21.159]  Now, this is very interesting to me because of the accuracy of what he was developing.
[03:08:21.159 --> 03:08:28.700]  If you really look at it, virtual reality, AI, our space program are all contained there in the work of Rudolf Steiner.
[03:08:29.030 --> 03:08:39.829]  But this character, Ahriman, which he developed, and he actually sculpted this, and he said while he was sculpting it, he had this impression of being in immense concrete.
[03:08:40.770 --> 03:08:44.850]  So he felt heavy, and the whole thing was weighing on him, as it were.
[03:08:45.170 --> 03:08:52.389]  It's quite fascinating because the character Ahriman, and people have made claims of seeing this even around 9-11, this figure.
[03:08:53.719 --> 03:08:54.479]  It's very interesting.
[03:08:54.819 --> 03:09:00.520]  Aramon, if you look into the history of it, is actually the name of a Persian devil, as it were.
[03:09:00.899 --> 03:09:08.559]  And, you know, it's Aramon versus Ahura Mazda, and they're twins, and they fight it out, the light force versus the dark force.
[03:09:09.020 --> 03:09:14.639]  Well, it's very interesting to go back and look at Steiner, because he's saying, look, what Aramon's going to do is develop an eighth sphere.
[03:09:15.170 --> 03:09:24.629]  And the eighth sphere is basically a virtual reality realm in the 21st century, and it will interrupt humanity's spiritual evolution.
[03:09:24.909 --> 03:09:31.350]  So that evolutionary path will get interrupted, and people will sort of fall into this eighth sphere.
[03:09:31.469 --> 03:09:37.229]  So it's the idea of a false reality, AI, you know, these different things, your avatar, whatever it happens to be.
[03:09:37.970 --> 03:09:45.370]  And that's because in those schools, they understand the different things about the astral body, the etheric body, the causal body.
[03:09:45.549 --> 03:09:49.190]  These are the various things that they've already understood and explored.
[03:09:49.409 --> 03:09:54.950]  So the eighth sphere is something that they see as kind of an artificial version, because humanity has all that.
[03:09:55.469 --> 03:09:59.110]  When we dream, we go into the astral realm, we do all these different types of things.
[03:09:59.479 --> 03:10:05.479]  But Ahriman, in developing the eighth sphere, is basically a high-tech version of this.
[03:10:05.620 --> 03:10:21.899]  And when you hear a lot of these scientists on the inside talk about the singularity and things of that nature, what they're really getting into is that they see the Tree of Life, which goes back to a lot of these things, all the way back to Egypt and the Kabbalah and other sources.
[03:10:22.350 --> 03:10:38.590]  But the Tree of Life, at a certain point, you have to advance along the line and go up that and become – you assume a whole identity of achieving a full spiritual human communion, and that is the Tree of Life.
[03:10:38.590 --> 03:10:41.590]  But what they want to do is kind of short-circuit that, basically.
[03:10:41.909 --> 03:10:52.709]  And they take the idea that we will take the animal aspect of ourselves and merge it with the mineral, which is the technology, which is the deep chips, which is the augmented human.
[03:10:52.950 --> 03:10:54.670]  All of these different aspects.
[03:10:55.899 --> 03:11:03.979]  It is interesting when you get around some of these people because you look at somebody like Musk, for example, and he's very deep, deep, deep in that system.
[03:11:04.319 --> 03:11:10.200]  And it's kind of fascinating with the other things that he's saying about, well, we need freedom of speech, we need all these other things.
[03:11:10.319 --> 03:11:14.280]  But Arman is part of this whole chipping of humanity aspect.
[03:11:14.819 --> 03:11:19.780]  So there's a crossover here that we have to really look at when you get into it.
[03:11:20.319 --> 03:11:34.819]  One of the other things I want to mention, since we've kind of looked at this a little bit, is that if you look at The Casey work and the Casey psychic work, the thing that he was able to bring forward in that mystery school tradition was the Atlantean records.
[03:11:35.260 --> 03:11:42.600]  And this whole aspect of a hall of records that these various groups have been looking for is not so far out as you might think.
[03:11:43.469 --> 03:11:53.829]  I found out, and I have the file here in my studio, of the Central Intelligence Agency launching a program to find Edgar Cayce's Hall of Records.
[03:11:53.989 --> 03:12:06.030]  And what they did is they took the Edgar Cayce organization, the Association for Research Enlightenment, and they put in, they actually placed people inside of it who were CIA operatives because they wanted information properly.
[03:12:06.059 --> 03:12:17.319]  This is what I call archaeology wars, and it's the control of humanity's story from beginning to end, which is why there's been so much resistance to the Atlantis story.
[03:12:17.620 --> 03:12:20.159]  But Cayce's version of it shows up this way.
[03:12:20.340 --> 03:12:21.180]  There are two groups.
[03:12:21.319 --> 03:12:22.780]  One of the groups is the Aemilius group.
[03:12:22.899 --> 03:12:24.340]  The other group is the Belial group.
[03:12:24.540 --> 03:12:32.440]  The Aemilius group develops incredible technology and uses it to interact with what he called the outer spheres, the saintly realm.
[03:12:33.179 --> 03:12:36.440]  And they set up these various people to interface with it.
[03:12:36.739 --> 03:12:50.739]  And so inside of Atlantis, the Belial group takes that information, they copy it, and then they realize, oh, hey, not only can these guys interact with the saintly realm, but we can use this as lasers and a power grid and all the rest.
[03:12:50.879 --> 03:12:53.760]  And so there a battle is staged and plays out.
[03:12:54.090 --> 03:13:04.290]  Casey gave this information over the period of three decades, and if you look at it in over 14,000 readings, there are 900 readings dealing with Atlantis.
[03:13:04.610 --> 03:13:07.629]  It's an extraordinary journey, and they're incredibly consistent.
[03:13:07.809 --> 03:13:17.950]  And what he's doing is he's going back and he's looking at that period, the last great period of human achievement through the technology where ultimately everything got blown to smithereens.
[03:13:18.399 --> 03:13:24.159]  And the idea that Casey developed was that it was something called a two-eye stone.
[03:13:24.420 --> 03:13:30.760]  And the network around the two-eye stone, which was a large-scale power system that did this.
[03:13:31.219 --> 03:13:36.059]  And two-eye is T-U-A-O-I. It's an unusual word that came directly out of the Casey readings.
[03:13:36.280 --> 03:13:39.579]  I do have a picture of this because what happened is...
[03:13:39.579 --> 03:13:41.299]  Let's see where we have it.
[03:13:42.420 --> 03:13:44.200]  What happened was...
[03:13:45.239 --> 03:13:53.399]  There's a NASA scientist, very interestingly enough, who decided, you know, this is getting too interesting.
[03:13:53.879 --> 03:13:55.399]  Casey talking about this two-eye stone.
[03:13:55.540 --> 03:13:56.860]  I want to see a model of this.
[03:13:56.979 --> 03:13:58.760]  Let's go through and find the model.
[03:13:59.340 --> 03:14:05.040]  And what he did was he developed an actual image of what the two-eye stone would look like.
[03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:10.579]  And that NASA scientist, for seven years, built different models of the two-eye stone.
[03:14:11.319 --> 03:14:16.079]  But the idea of the Hall of Records and the Two-Eye Stone, that all comes from the Casey readings.
[03:14:16.319 --> 03:14:24.239]  And somebody, when you're talking about space and advanced technology, you might think, well, what does the Mystery School or some psychic have to do with this stuff?
[03:14:24.500 --> 03:14:25.579]  Maybe a great deal.
[03:14:26.139 --> 03:14:31.020]  Because, you know, we love to entertain and you see programs about ancient aliens and things like that.
[03:14:31.200 --> 03:14:33.700]  But what if it, in fact, is human technology?
[03:14:33.700 --> 03:14:34.959]  That's advanced technology.
[03:14:34.959 --> 03:14:41.739]  We reached a point which is far beyond our own civilization back then, and that civilization destroyed itself.
[03:14:41.860 --> 03:14:45.100]  And so we're coming back in and facing up against it.
[03:14:45.600 --> 03:14:46.739]  Oh, and there you have it.
[03:14:46.840 --> 03:14:53.659]  That is the actual drawing by a NASA scientist of Casey's reading of the Toy Stone advanced technology.
[03:14:53.760 --> 03:14:55.399]  This was the power grid.
[03:14:55.790 --> 03:14:56.850]  In Atlantis.
[03:14:57.290 --> 03:15:06.649]  And it was amazing because this particular NASA scientist, when he looked at it, said, this is such erudite information coming from these guys' readings.
[03:15:07.270 --> 03:15:14.049]  We could be using this thing to launch propulsion for different space vehicles and things of this nature.
[03:15:14.399 --> 03:15:22.219]  So we're looking at that crisscross there about where we get information and how, in general, that information is siloed.
[03:15:22.239 --> 03:15:34.559]  So you have people over here who look into things that have to do more with, you know, the kind of spiritual woo, psychic aspect, and it's completely segmented away from the people who are doing this hardcore thing.
[03:15:40.649 --> 03:15:52.629]  Well, it's a great lack because if you can combine those things, you get an incredible potent force of knowledge and information.
[03:15:53.110 --> 03:15:55.149]  That's what they have behind the scenes.
[03:15:55.290 --> 03:15:56.790]  That's why they have remote viewers.
[03:15:56.989 --> 03:16:02.190]  That's why they have CIA programs to infiltrate the Casey Institute of all places.
[03:16:02.530 --> 03:16:06.290]  That's why you had the looting of the Baghdad Museum.
[03:16:06.770 --> 03:16:11.770]  And they were looking for these various ancient devices for things.
[03:16:11.930 --> 03:16:15.229]  It has to be an aspect that gets considered around it.
[03:16:15.329 --> 03:16:24.489]  I'll tell you another interesting piece related to this is when we look at that whole Nazi Arthurian piece back there.
[03:16:24.889 --> 03:16:27.090]  Well, the Nazis were obsessed with it.
[03:16:27.170 --> 03:16:31.950]  As a matter of fact, they say the entire Anschluss of taking over Austria...
[03:16:32.110 --> 03:16:40.610]  It was just so he'd go into this one museum where he could get this sort of power that had pierced the side of Christ during the crucifixion.
[03:16:40.770 --> 03:16:43.649]  So this thing runs very, very deep.
[03:16:43.790 --> 03:16:56.450]  And when we get around the early versions of the mystery schools, there's these secret societies that break off from the mystery schools, and they do something totally different with the information and the knowledge.
[03:16:57.380 --> 03:17:11.280]  And one of the things I'll mention about Steiner is he said that at that point in 1920, when he was writing about this, that the secret societies and the mystery schools operated about 85% of the politics in America at the time.
[03:17:12.340 --> 03:17:14.340]  Their influence could have only increased since then.
[03:17:14.600 --> 03:17:19.040]  So these people are all involved either with a mystery school or with a different secret society.
[03:17:19.200 --> 03:17:24.260]  The question is, we have two different sides of that, you know, the right path and the left path.
[03:17:24.420 --> 03:17:27.760]  And those are not political designations by any stretch of the imagination.
[03:17:28.120 --> 03:17:34.979]  But we have to understand where these people come from, where their beliefs are, and how does that relate to what we're seeing on the ground?
[03:17:34.979 --> 03:17:44.090]  For example, why are you seeing the biggest black magician in history being behind the founder of NASA? You know, Jack Parsons, as we mentioned earlier.
[03:17:44.430 --> 03:17:59.690]  These things are incredible crossovers, and if you don't think that's enough of a crossover, then look to Scientology, where you see L. Ron Hubbard, and he's the same guy who's working with Parsons during that period, and they're sharing everything, they're living together.
[03:18:00.229 --> 03:18:07.329]  And, you know, so Parsons working hand in hand with the leader of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard.
[03:18:07.960 --> 03:18:17.020]  You have to put together, because how much influence and impact has L. Ron Hubbard had, for example, on Hollywood, on the intelligence agencies, and other places?
[03:18:17.319 --> 03:18:20.120]  You have to be able to look and see those crossovers.
[03:18:20.219 --> 03:18:21.459]  That's what I call dark journalism.
[03:18:21.959 --> 03:18:27.500]  And I'll tell you, you don't need any fiction when you get into that level, when you look at some of these people.
[03:18:27.559 --> 03:18:40.819]  And another thing I want to say about Hubbard, which is quite fascinating, is he wrote over He's one of the most prolific writers in history for the amount of science fiction books that he wrote.
[03:18:41.059 --> 03:18:56.270]  So this guy was extraordinary, and he mused to Parsons at a certain point that if he could develop a religion— It would be the greatest benefit because he could take all of his ideas and funnel them into a religion,
[03:18:56.270 --> 03:18:58.809]  and also he could sort of be independent.
[03:18:59.870 --> 03:19:12.770]  Now, he also, I would say this other thing about Hubbard, which is he understood that the whole black magic aspect that Parsons was dealing with was the key to developing the system of Scientology.
[03:19:12.770 --> 03:19:16.149]  So it comes out of that OTO organization itself.
[03:19:16.190 --> 03:19:18.829]  Of Parsons and Crowley.
[03:19:18.989 --> 03:19:30.190]  And it's very interesting because there's a letter on record where Crowley is writing to Parsons and he says about our friend, L. Ron Hubbard, look, you know, stay away from this guy.
[03:19:30.309 --> 03:19:34.329]  Hubbard, you know, he's a dark personality and he's immoral.
[03:19:34.549 --> 03:19:38.750]  Well, if you've got Aleister Crowley calling you immoral, how bad off do you have to be?
[03:19:39.170 --> 03:19:41.829]  So, these things do go a lot deeper.
[03:19:41.829 --> 03:19:47.569]  And I think when we include the psychic and the mystic aspect in this, you're opening up a tremendous veil.
[03:19:47.870 --> 03:19:54.090]  Now, you know, understandably, there's a lot of resistance because you have occult aspects involved.
[03:19:54.110 --> 03:19:56.569]  But remember, there's esoteric and there's occult.
[03:19:56.959 --> 03:20:03.819]  And the occult aspect tends to be locked in or locked up very often with the black magic aspect.
[03:20:05.379 --> 03:20:08.059]  But how does this all play out in the power structure?
[03:20:08.200 --> 03:20:18.979]  Our great knowledge on behalf of the American public and beyond about how these groups work and what their foundations are is only gonna open things up for us to understand how the geopolitical scene works.
[03:20:19.379 --> 03:20:23.379]  And these people are centered and hanging out there right in the middle.
[03:20:23.579 --> 03:20:24.840]  We're going to be back in the next segment.
[03:20:24.979 --> 03:20:26.799]  I've got more for you on NorthCom.
[03:20:27.020 --> 03:20:31.319]  And it's great to be here with everyone on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:31.459 --> 03:20:33.000]  Of course, support Alex and his efforts.
[03:20:33.340 --> 03:20:37.020]  And we, of course, are very psyched to have InfoWars up and running.
[03:20:37.379 --> 03:20:39.200]  And it's a great pleasure to be here.
[03:20:39.319 --> 03:20:40.559]  I'm Daniel List, dark journalist.
[03:20:41.259 --> 03:20:47.860]  My dad is chemistry background, also a retired doctor, but he came in to help me run my supplement division 13 years ago.
[03:20:48.360 --> 03:20:49.659]  The deep state sued the hell out of him.
[03:20:49.780 --> 03:20:51.100]  We're going to our guest in a moment, but I gotta do this.
[03:20:51.180 --> 03:20:51.520]  Thank you, sir.
[03:20:52.100 --> 03:20:55.680]  And they basically almost destroyed my parents.
[03:20:55.819 --> 03:20:58.319]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family.
[03:20:58.690 --> 03:21:02.229]  That my dad was at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits the Democrats filed.
[03:21:02.409 --> 03:21:06.229]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are $316 million yesterday.
[03:21:06.649 --> 03:21:09.190]  They filed before they spent $80 million suing me.
[03:21:09.450 --> 03:21:11.010]  We spent $16 million fighting them.
[03:21:11.170 --> 03:21:12.870]  My dad spent $2 million fighting them.
[03:21:12.950 --> 03:21:14.049]  And we're finally winning.
[03:21:14.250 --> 03:21:25.569]  Not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnationals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request I ask you to support him because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[03:21:25.690 --> 03:21:28.209]  He was giving everything to InfoWars.
[03:21:28.399 --> 03:21:34.639]  And then, personally, going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me.
[03:21:34.719 --> 03:21:35.739]  Because that's how dads are.
[03:21:35.959 --> 03:21:37.239]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[03:21:37.379 --> 03:21:42.280]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office.
[03:21:42.420 --> 03:21:43.520]  And I got pissed.
[03:21:44.120 --> 03:21:51.260]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[03:21:51.989 --> 03:21:52.969]  The supplements are there.
[03:21:53.149 --> 03:21:53.770]  They're great.
[03:21:53.950 --> 03:21:55.129]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[03:21:55.209 --> 03:21:56.049]  He's put everything into it.
[03:21:56.090 --> 03:21:56.489]  He has.
[03:21:56.569 --> 03:21:57.129]  They're incredible.
[03:21:57.389 --> 03:22:07.090]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, that I don't want to belabor this.
[03:22:07.090 --> 03:22:08.389]  We have important topics to cover.

[03:22:32.780 --> 03:22:39.219]  Literally took a loan last week to be able to buy the product that's coming in finally next week.
[03:22:39.420 --> 03:22:41.500]  Turbo Force, things like that that are popular.
[03:22:41.700 --> 03:22:44.200]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[03:22:44.760 --> 03:22:48.719]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[03:22:49.020 --> 03:22:50.360]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[03:22:50.500 --> 03:22:51.139]  He's a fighter.
[03:22:51.260 --> 03:22:52.100]  Hell, he's my dad.
[03:22:52.260 --> 03:22:53.219]  I think I'm a fighter.
[03:22:53.440 --> 03:22:54.879]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[03:22:55.510 --> 03:23:03.049]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[03:23:03.229 --> 03:23:05.889]  But this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[03:23:06.030 --> 03:23:06.989]  It's about my parents.
[03:23:07.569 --> 03:23:13.110]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's what the enemy targeted them.

[03:23:36.389 --> 03:23:39.389]  So thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:23:39.469 --> 03:23:40.969]  I'm going to shut up at the balance of this hour.
[03:23:41.170 --> 03:23:42.090]  Well, it's so great.
[03:23:48.790 --> 03:23:52.809]  We're good to go.
[03:24:13.180 --> 03:24:16.159]  You know, they raise this, they get that impression.
[03:24:16.379 --> 03:24:32.059]  One of the key things I think that we've seen is during that period of the pandemic, when they brought in all of this COVID operation, they were rolling out these videos and things of UFOs that were brought forward by counterintelligence agencies.
[03:24:32.489 --> 03:24:35.989]  And the different agents had supposedly smuggled these things out.
[03:24:36.129 --> 03:24:42.729]  Well, let me tell you, the government doesn't work like that, and these guys sitting comfortably and having television shows and stuff.
[03:24:43.280 --> 03:24:44.399]  There's no question.
[03:24:44.780 --> 03:24:50.940]  And there were a lot of DOD billionaires in the background putting these guys forward and doing that whole bit.
[03:24:51.420 --> 03:24:58.399]  One of the things I think that's important about the Chinese balloon story is it relates, it's like a back end directly to the drone story.
[03:24:58.540 --> 03:25:03.760]  And as we've seen now, the FAA has said, oh, we're going to use deadly force to shoot down drones.
[03:25:03.920 --> 03:25:07.540]  There's a huge shift in position from denying that anything was going on.
[03:25:07.680 --> 03:25:13.100]  And I really want to deliver this message to independent media around the world.
[03:25:13.350 --> 03:25:19.649]  Which is get on board with finding out what is behind that and pressure the government to say exactly what's going on here.
[03:25:20.049 --> 03:25:23.450]  Don't get lazy and say, oh, it's people imagining planes or something.
[03:25:24.149 --> 03:25:26.049]  I mentioned Judge Napolitano earlier.
[03:25:26.049 --> 03:25:30.610]  It's quite interesting because he said they were hanging out over his farm.
[03:25:31.309 --> 03:25:34.510]  How would you like that, just to have these drones hanging out over his farm?
[03:25:34.569 --> 03:25:38.309]  He said at a certain point I was looking at them and they seemed like they were just looking back at me.
[03:25:38.469 --> 03:25:41.969]  It's very, very unusual things that are going on.
[03:25:42.190 --> 03:25:43.989]  People have been honest and on the ground.
[03:25:44.270 --> 03:25:47.549]  Sure, there are misidentifications here and there, but this is a massive wave.
[03:25:47.549 --> 03:25:49.889]  I can tell you, I've been studying this for decades.
[03:25:50.049 --> 03:25:53.909]  This is very unusual, highly unusual, and is a rollout.
[03:25:54.069 --> 03:25:55.090]  It's a test.
[03:25:55.090 --> 03:25:59.530]  And the question always is, when you get around these tests, will the tests go live?
[03:25:59.629 --> 03:26:00.450]  That's the question.
[03:26:00.750 --> 03:26:06.750]  Now, one of the things that I wanted to put out there, actually, is about this Doomsday Network issue.
[03:26:07.010 --> 03:26:12.750]  And the picture is actually X3. If we can put that up during the segment, that would be super.
[03:26:13.110 --> 03:26:24.829]  One of the things that's very interesting about this is the Doomsday Network is something now that was designed to survive a nuclear decapitation of the government at that point.
[03:26:25.329 --> 03:26:33.370]  Truman and Ike had put these things together, and this was the early version of COG that was going on and had a very legitimate purpose, if you think about it.
[03:26:33.690 --> 03:26:38.290]  What's very interesting and often missed in this development is Moon Township.
[03:26:38.569 --> 03:26:48.389]  Moon Township is in Pennsylvania, and for me, it is actually the original Area 51. And the things that go on, it's a very nice town, by the way.
[03:26:48.530 --> 03:26:49.690]  The people there are great.
[03:26:49.829 --> 03:26:55.750]  But the military development in the background is some of the deepest black projects that you can possibly imagine.
[03:26:56.090 --> 03:26:57.530]  That is the airport.
[03:26:57.889 --> 03:27:02.069]  It's Pittsburgh International Airport designed after an X for a reason.
[03:27:02.229 --> 03:27:06.110]  It's relating directly to that X technology we've discussed in the background.
[03:27:06.430 --> 03:27:11.270]  The exotic technology development in Moon, Pennsylvania, this is something I suggest.
[03:27:11.270 --> 03:27:14.549]  I call it ex-geography because we need to shift things around here.
[03:27:14.670 --> 03:27:20.129]  They've kept us so focused on places like Nevada, saying, well, Area 51 and all the rest of it.
[03:27:20.309 --> 03:27:23.729]  You know, the word is generally, once you hear that the stuff is there, it's gone.
[03:27:25.209 --> 03:27:26.469]  This is the nature of it.
[03:27:26.569 --> 03:27:29.110]  But Moon, I think, is particularly interesting.
[03:27:29.370 --> 03:27:32.229]  And let's talk about this Doomsday Network and how it was rolled out.
[03:27:32.629 --> 03:27:50.780]  So at a certain point, this network was designed to survive a nuclear catastrophe, which was a legitimate Thank you.
[03:28:08.360 --> 03:28:13.200]  I think we're good to go.
[03:28:24.340 --> 03:28:26.840]  I think?
[03:28:41.110 --> 03:28:43.190]  And Eisenhower selected him particularly.
[03:28:43.629 --> 03:28:46.790]  They didn't only want political and military people.
[03:28:46.950 --> 03:28:47.950]  They wanted other people.
[03:28:48.129 --> 03:28:59.510]  So when you see people floating around out there like Oprah Winfrey and others who are just so in with the various plans of the deep state and all the rest, it doesn't seem to make any sense.
[03:28:59.510 --> 03:29:00.950]  Because you're like, well, they're entertainers.
[03:29:01.030 --> 03:29:03.489]  Wouldn't they stand up against this or stand up against that?
[03:29:03.829 --> 03:29:07.010]  Why are they all walking in lock, stock, and barrel?
[03:29:07.170 --> 03:29:08.149]  It doesn't make any sense.
[03:29:08.350 --> 03:29:09.850]  Well, there's a good reason for it.
[03:29:09.909 --> 03:29:12.030]  They've been promised a place inside the bunker.
[03:29:12.809 --> 03:29:14.629]  And this is the nature of the problem.
[03:29:14.889 --> 03:29:19.370]  The Doomsday Network, it's been traced through these various events.
[03:29:19.629 --> 03:29:31.110]  Even in the Kennedy assassination, it was utilized by a Secret Service agent named Winston Lawson, who for some reason was using the COG communications during the heart of the assassination.
[03:29:31.720 --> 03:29:33.159]  Now, it's very interesting.
[03:29:33.159 --> 03:29:46.180]  If you go further along through history, you're going to find in Watergate that John Dean had just, when he was working for the assistant attorney general, that he was just out of working for the continuity of government group.
[03:29:46.340 --> 03:29:57.040]  While you go along a little further, you're going to find Oliver North, who's running all these missiles to Iran and Getting them back to Central America so they can fund these contras and all that stuff in the 1980s with Reagan.
[03:29:57.379 --> 03:30:01.479]  Well, that's Reagan and Cheney and Bush and all this group.
[03:30:01.739 --> 03:30:03.459]  They are using what?
[03:30:03.620 --> 03:30:04.000]  What was it?
[03:30:04.059 --> 03:30:05.340]  It was determined that he was using.
[03:30:05.360 --> 03:30:07.579]  He was using the COG Doomsday Network.
[03:30:07.879 --> 03:30:10.040]  Well, why do they call it the Doomsday Network?
[03:30:10.260 --> 03:30:10.979]  It's quite interesting.
[03:30:11.219 --> 03:30:13.459]  They used the Doomsday Network on 9-11.
[03:30:13.860 --> 03:30:17.620]  They activated continuity of government for the first time during 9-11.
[03:30:17.780 --> 03:30:18.739]  That's the crucial aspect.
[03:30:19.549 --> 03:30:25.969]  And that's admitted even on a federal level, and even the media admits that yes, COG was activated.
[03:30:26.090 --> 03:30:28.329]  So we know of one occasion where it's actually been activated.
[03:30:28.549 --> 03:30:31.690]  The question is, are we in COG light?
[03:30:31.870 --> 03:30:39.770]  We are in fact in COG light because we're still under the September 11th emergency, which is signed onto by every president.
[03:30:40.319 --> 03:30:44.020]  Every president since Bush, W. Bush.
[03:30:44.280 --> 03:30:48.139]  And it's very interesting because the NDAA attaches it.
[03:30:48.239 --> 03:30:55.920]  And that National Defense Authorization Act, they've used to railroad the public and attach things into it that the public would have no interest in.
[03:30:56.120 --> 03:31:04.280]  Well, what they do is, since it's a trillion dollars in funding for various military expenditures, you're holding up a whole lot of money if you stand up against it.
[03:31:04.719 --> 03:31:17.520]  So presidents from Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden all signed the NDAA, which reauthorizes the COG program under the September 11th emergency.
[03:31:17.840 --> 03:31:27.200]  But the thing is, it was so well crafted by Rumsfeld and Cheney during that period that you have to look into the history of Rumsfeld.
[03:31:27.280 --> 03:31:31.520]  You have to look into the history of Cheney because they were there working for Ford.
[03:31:31.719 --> 03:31:36.719]  Remember the That, in fact, Rumsfeld was the youngest defense secretary in history working for Ford.
[03:31:37.139 --> 03:31:40.139]  And then he shows back up as an older defense secretary.
[03:31:40.139 --> 03:31:41.100]  And guess what?
[03:31:41.200 --> 03:31:45.020]  They're both developing in between that continuity of government program.
[03:31:45.280 --> 03:31:53.180]  So the COG that was designed by Rumsfeld and Cheney had one crucial link different from what was developed by Eisenhower.
[03:31:53.500 --> 03:32:00.420]  It changed the version of, to survive in nuclear emergencies, we'll call in this martial law.
[03:32:01.100 --> 03:32:02.620]  And we'll do all these various things.
[03:32:02.799 --> 03:32:05.420]  It took that off the table and said for any emergency.
[03:32:05.840 --> 03:32:10.059]  And then there was an update in 2007, which is crucial.
[03:32:10.059 --> 03:32:17.219]  And I think what we're seeing now in relation to the UFO file aspect of this and the UFO threat being pushed by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[03:32:17.459 --> 03:32:28.360]  In 2007, what they said was any event, any event that causes us to go into an emergency can trigger off continuity of government.
[03:32:29.010 --> 03:32:46.030]  So this is the update, and it's interesting because if you go into those different files, one of the things I want to point out is that in 2023, I pointed out after doing a lot of deep research and talking to a lot of people on the inside, that the program was actually called BLUE,
[03:32:46.149 --> 03:32:52.030]  and that's the program that we've been developing over time that relates to the emergency aspect of the UFO file.
[03:32:52.520 --> 03:33:00.040]  I.e., if you encounter a UFO threat, the ability of the government to counter that threat by calling in martial law.
[03:33:00.440 --> 03:33:02.139]  The program is called Blue.
[03:33:02.420 --> 03:33:03.399]  That was the development.
[03:33:03.620 --> 03:33:17.260]  And it goes all the way back to Project Blue Book, the things you hear about Blue Beam, this whole thing about Blue Gemini under the Kennedy administration, and Blue Berets, who were the ones who were set up specifically to get crash retrievals if a UFO crashes.
[03:33:17.629 --> 03:33:19.229]  And the military need to go in there.
[03:33:19.409 --> 03:33:21.629]  They need to secure the area and silence all the witnesses.
[03:33:21.829 --> 03:33:33.829]  That was the basic protocol until they recently changed it in 2018. Now, one of the things that they do with the Blue program is we put it on the record and all kinds of weird things started to go on in the background.
[03:33:33.850 --> 03:33:39.549]  I started to notice all these stories coming out about a whistleblower is going to come forward and say this and that about the UFO file.
[03:33:39.690 --> 03:33:45.409]  And some of them reached out to me directly and they said, how did you get the name in your program?
[03:33:45.670 --> 03:33:46.850]  Where did you get the name from?
[03:33:47.859 --> 03:33:50.360]  So that raised some red flags for me.
[03:33:50.500 --> 03:33:53.620]  And then the government came out and said, yes, we have a blue program.
[03:33:53.879 --> 03:33:58.340]  It was set up to do crash retrievals of these UFOs, but it never recovered any.
[03:33:58.500 --> 03:34:00.299]  So just forget about it.
[03:34:00.520 --> 03:34:04.379]  And the version of it that we're willing to talk about is Kona Blue.
[03:34:05.059 --> 03:34:09.180]  And so there was a code associated with Kona that had to do with these previous crashes.
[03:34:09.479 --> 03:34:13.840]  Well, what I found out when I studied the COG aspect was that...
[03:34:15.090 --> 03:34:19.629]  Blue is one of the color designations of the COG group.
[03:34:19.770 --> 03:34:22.690]  So when they take over, they have these military designations.
[03:34:22.690 --> 03:34:25.149]  You have the combatant commander, which is Gregory Gio.
[03:34:25.409 --> 03:34:27.569]  And I have a picture of Gio.
[03:34:28.350 --> 03:34:34.250]  Gio's picture would be Northcom commander X4. Gio is quite interesting because...
[03:34:35.370 --> 03:34:45.370]  He now would be the person who would become the total ruler of the United States in the event of a UFO emergency, or a drone emergency, the drone swarm emergencies, whatever you want to call it.
[03:34:45.670 --> 03:34:52.690]  Certainly, it comes under the UFO designation, or UAP, as they like to do the marketing around that.
[03:34:52.850 --> 03:34:56.190]  Now, here's the interesting thing, and what I think is crucial to put across.
[03:34:56.370 --> 03:34:57.450]  This is General Guillaume.
[03:34:57.930 --> 03:35:02.850]  Guillaume is now in charge of NORTHCOM, NORAD, and his COG combatant commander.
[03:35:03.180 --> 03:35:19.659]  If, through the drone swarms, you triggered off a UFO threat narrative, and you could say the United States at its military bases is under siege by these drones, we don't know what they're doing, then we need to call in the emergency forces of COG. He would become the complete ruler of the United States,
[03:35:19.680 --> 03:35:21.079]  and the president could take a powder.
[03:35:21.239 --> 03:35:23.899]  In this case, we wouldn't be missing much with President Biden.
[03:35:26.130 --> 03:35:28.430]  I think?
[03:35:51.670 --> 03:35:56.469]  So, this situation rests there.
[03:35:56.489 --> 03:36:05.610]  Now, I'm not saying that they will call emergency powers and COG, but that they have the ability through that UFO threat emergency to do so.
[03:36:05.809 --> 03:36:08.350]  Therefore, we don't know anything about that program.
[03:36:08.549 --> 03:36:10.670]  You can imagine the things that go through their mind.
[03:36:10.950 --> 03:36:15.090]  This guy, Guillaume, is being told, you're gonna found a new civilization if this happens.
[03:36:15.090 --> 03:36:21.270]  You're gonna be the person who designates what the different groups, how to repopulate the Earth and all these things.
[03:36:21.409 --> 03:36:24.829]  That's the place that these people are in, in their mind.
[03:36:25.159 --> 03:36:35.620]  And there's a famous example of this, actually, and it goes back to the Kennedy administration, and it's a movie called Seven Days in May, where literally a COG commander takes over.
[03:36:36.139 --> 03:36:43.159]  And the whole movie is about the COG commander attempting to take over because he thinks the president is weak in relation to the Russians.
[03:36:43.700 --> 03:36:45.520]  And Kennedy did all these things.
[03:36:45.620 --> 03:36:46.479]  He cleared the White House.
[03:36:46.600 --> 03:36:48.799]  He let the director, Frankenheimer, use the White House.
[03:36:48.899 --> 03:36:51.719]  He said, people need to know how things actually work.
[03:36:52.310 --> 03:36:56.170]  And that's a very early shot across the bow there, that movie.
[03:36:56.350 --> 03:37:01.170]  And there's so many interesting things, but it's the first real admission of COG being involved.
[03:37:01.329 --> 03:37:04.010]  Now, how does the UFO file relate to that?
[03:37:04.170 --> 03:37:07.709]  If you look, actually, in the movie, this has been called out before.
[03:37:08.010 --> 03:37:16.469]  In the movie, over the back of the general, who is the COG commander taking over, you can see on a map Roswell, New Mexico.
[03:37:16.629 --> 03:37:19.010]  And I'm going to tell you how unusual that is.
[03:37:19.340 --> 03:37:24.360]  In 1947, when the crash happened, there was a story that went around the world about Roswell.
[03:37:24.520 --> 03:37:29.780]  But in fact, the story of Roswell disappeared because once they said it was a weather balloon, it was cleared out.
[03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:38.739]  The intelligence officer, Jesse Marcel, who found the wreckage, in 1980 came out and said, yeah, I found all this stuff covered in hieroglyphics.
[03:37:39.219 --> 03:37:42.180]  On this guy's ranch and we couldn't do anything with the metal.
[03:37:42.340 --> 03:37:43.700]  It was like a strange memory metal.
[03:37:43.899 --> 03:37:44.680]  We couldn't burn it.
[03:37:44.760 --> 03:37:45.399]  We couldn't bend it.
[03:37:45.459 --> 03:37:46.739]  There was nothing that we could do with it.
[03:37:46.920 --> 03:37:49.739]  And he said the debris field was for miles.
[03:37:49.819 --> 03:37:51.879]  So they cleaned up that whole debris field.
[03:37:52.319 --> 03:37:57.819]  But he came out with that story in 1980. So people in 1964 didn't know anything about Roswell.
[03:37:57.959 --> 03:37:59.879]  It was a buried story in a local newspaper.
[03:38:00.670 --> 03:38:17.770]  So therefore, the knowledge of the person who put Roswell behind the COG commander shows maybe Kennedy is tipping him off and saying, by the way, this is where the basis of this is and comes from, which is the UFO technology advances our technology program.
[03:38:17.930 --> 03:38:21.889]  It gives them the ability to say the advanced technology is too important.
[03:38:22.069 --> 03:38:27.290]  Remember Robert Sarbarker, who, as I've pointed out before, has been rubbed out of history, basically.
[03:38:27.530 --> 03:38:29.850]  You can't even find a Wikipedia page on this guy.
[03:38:30.149 --> 03:38:34.409]  Sorry, Barker was just as big as, you know, you can imagine.
[03:38:34.610 --> 03:38:36.389]  They had the movie Oppenheimer last year.
[03:38:36.549 --> 03:38:37.569]  This guy was just as big.
[03:38:37.670 --> 03:38:54.309]  He was on Time Magazine, Saturday Evening Post in that period, and he was involved with Thomas Townsend Brown, who was a deep, deep black projects scientist who wanted to share the information with the public and actually set up UFO groups in the 1950s for that purpose.
[03:38:54.309 --> 03:38:58.409]  I actually spoke to his daughter and family members on many occasions.
[03:39:00.190 --> 03:39:07.450]  That she told me is that he had developed something, an advanced piece of technology called the acoustic fan.
[03:39:07.649 --> 03:39:16.469]  And the acoustic fan basically created an orb, and it would show a person the outline of their life in the future and all the things that they would do.
[03:39:16.629 --> 03:39:19.049]  And that he demonstrated this acoustic fan.
[03:39:23.440 --> 03:39:25.319]  We're good to go.
[03:39:49.729 --> 03:39:58.629]  I like to split these groups up, actually, as the group inside the government that holds the technology on the UFO side is called XProtect.
[03:39:59.000 --> 03:40:01.260]  The other group is called X-Share.
[03:40:01.399 --> 03:40:04.399]  So it's a much smaller group, but they want to share the technology.
[03:40:04.600 --> 03:40:08.819]  And I think that that X-Share group was in touch and worked with President Kennedy.
[03:40:08.979 --> 03:40:14.579]  And I think throughout the ages, we can see these moves for disclosure that happen.
[03:40:14.739 --> 03:40:21.959]  And there's this piggyback operation where they take the legitimate disclosure and they try to use it for some military purpose.
[03:40:22.079 --> 03:40:24.680]  This is what we're seeing with the CIA threat narrative.
[03:40:24.930 --> 03:40:27.950]  It's undeniable what's taking place in relation to that.
[03:40:28.090 --> 03:40:32.190]  And the drone swarm is directly related to that UFO threat narrative.
[03:40:32.350 --> 03:40:37.409]  As a matter of fact, it's one of the things that we've been tracking on the Dark Journalist show for quite a while.
[03:40:37.729 --> 03:40:47.530]  And that pattern that you can read so obviously relates to the fact that that technology is a higher secret, according to Sarr Barker, than the atomic bomb.
[03:40:47.969 --> 03:40:50.709]  So this is extraordinary when you think about it.
[03:40:51.530 --> 03:40:53.930]  The other thing I want to say about this...
[03:40:54.620 --> 03:41:01.159]  If you think about the technology and the aspects around it, look, Russia is saying we have hypersonic missiles.
[03:41:01.500 --> 03:41:06.639]  You guys, you know, you won't put nukes on our doorstep and all the rest of it.
[03:41:07.219 --> 03:41:13.860]  1987, Reagan and Gorbachev proposed to eliminate the entire nuclear arsenal.
[03:41:14.459 --> 03:41:17.299]  How on earth could you eliminate the nuclear arsenal?
[03:41:17.500 --> 03:41:19.780]  You must have something else.
[03:41:19.959 --> 03:41:21.040]  It's a different weapon.
[03:41:21.239 --> 03:41:25.000]  And they like to talk about kinetic weapons and things of this nature.
[03:41:25.219 --> 03:41:37.040]  The idea of a particle beam weapon or rods of God weapon or something advanced that they've developed out of this technology would give them the ability to launch a UFO threat narrative.
[03:41:37.239 --> 03:41:38.040]  Here's the thing.
[03:41:38.579 --> 03:41:39.780]  The UFOs are obvious.
[03:41:39.959 --> 03:41:40.379]  They're real.
[03:41:40.500 --> 03:41:41.639]  They've been here throughout history.
[03:41:41.639 --> 03:41:46.280]  There's no question, but they've never shown any signs of threatening the public.
[03:41:46.379 --> 03:41:59.260]  But the idea and the fear that exists in the subconscious can be exploited by these groups inside the intelligence agencies, rolling out false whistleblowers through counterintelligence programs, through Congress, as we've seen.
[03:41:59.340 --> 03:42:04.819]  And you have guys up there, like Congressman Tim Burchett and stuff, and They want answers.
[03:42:04.819 --> 03:42:06.799]  They just don't know anything about the UFO file.
[03:42:06.959 --> 03:42:08.879]  So this is the nature of the problem.
[03:42:09.040 --> 03:42:10.459]  They'd like to get to the bottom of it.
[03:42:11.500 --> 03:42:15.719]  Anna Paluna Luna, she would like to do it as the congresswoman from Florida.
[03:42:15.959 --> 03:42:25.860]  You just don't have enough background on the UFO file so you can be easily bamboozled, which is what happened to Nancy Mace, the congresswoman, during the last UFO hearing.
[03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:28.079]  Because the CIA runs the tables on that.
[03:42:28.360 --> 03:42:40.819]  Once I heard the Department of Homeland Security was the venue for the UFO hearings that took place before that, you cannot have things like DHS and the CIA involved on that level because you're not going to get the truth from them.
[03:42:41.059 --> 03:42:48.239]  Actually, counterintelligence agencies of what they do and the agents that are involved are the best liars on the planet.
[03:42:48.600 --> 03:42:55.000]  Now, sure, most counterintelligence agents do that for patriotic purpose, and I salute their efforts and their work.
[03:42:55.459 --> 03:43:03.739]  But I also know that counterintelligence agents around the UFO file are going to spill the best lies, and that's what we've been getting, the absolute best lies.
[03:43:03.899 --> 03:43:20.829]  This all relates because the continuity of government program and the illegal structure of NORTHCOM set up after 9-11 gives them the ability to We're good to go.
[03:43:31.829 --> 03:43:35.090]  Take advantage of the idea of the drones forms of the airports and the military bases.
[03:43:35.489 --> 03:43:37.989]  This gets us into a very deep angle.
[03:43:38.170 --> 03:43:41.729]  We need the answers before the full-on emergency takes place.
[03:43:42.209 --> 03:43:45.909]  That's the thing that you need to press out of the government in relation to this.
[03:43:46.010 --> 03:43:58.010]  And the other aspect is you have to have the greatest possible tracking of the UFO aspect in relation to this, which means you have to take the UFO technology aspect seriously regardless of where you think it's coming from.
[03:43:58.190 --> 03:44:01.389]  And that's what I think that sets the difference in terms of geopolitics.
[03:44:02.130 --> 03:44:11.110]  So we're in a very tricky scenario because the person that we have coming into office, the president-elect, is somebody that the deep state does not want in there.
[03:44:11.729 --> 03:44:15.790]  Under any circumstances, look at all the different things they did to stop Trump.
[03:44:16.090 --> 03:44:22.250]  And I'm not saying Trump is perfect, but you can see clearly he's not deep in that gang.
[03:44:22.409 --> 03:44:24.090]  He has his own power base.
[03:44:24.750 --> 03:44:41.360]  It's very well known that there's a whole Fortress America idea, which is different from the globalist We're good to go.
[03:44:46.620 --> 03:44:51.620]  And it's all about the foundation of America, the Constitution, and all the rest.
[03:44:51.760 --> 03:45:01.899]  So even regardless of the different problems you might have with this or that person in the administration, this is much more aligned with constitutional principles than the freak show we've been living under for the past four years.
[03:45:02.360 --> 03:45:11.659]  So, you know, they're moving into, which is, it becomes common to the idea of them getting rid of free speech, the definition of a woman, whatever it happens to be.
[03:45:12.079 --> 03:45:15.319]  These are aspects that are prepping the narrative.
[03:45:15.319 --> 03:45:22.860]  And then when you bring in, it's not divorced from all that, it's right in the heart of it, the UFO technology aspect.
[03:45:26.829 --> 03:45:30.829]  We're good to go.
[03:45:50.010 --> 03:45:51.549]  I'm looking at the UFO file.
[03:45:51.549 --> 03:45:55.110]  I'm looking at the psychic mystical aspects involved with this, because they are.
[03:45:55.850 --> 03:46:00.129]  And I'm also looking at the deep geopolitical deep state actors.
[03:46:00.430 --> 03:46:06.229]  So you need to start to look at how they're prepping the narrative, and you need to use all those different levels.
[03:46:07.350 --> 03:46:16.430]  And I do feel like, you know, when you're looking at this, one of the greatest examples, of course, I think I have it here.
[03:46:24.709 --> 03:46:27.090]  Welcome to my show.
[03:46:41.829 --> 03:46:47.010]  That picture right there was drawn by the most famous abductee, and it is called Junior.
[03:46:47.309 --> 03:46:55.209]  This is the being that abducted Betty Hill, and she had long conversations, telepathic conversations with this while she was being examined.
[03:46:55.389 --> 03:47:04.209]  This is another part of the apotheum that takes place, and all the missing time that was involved in that case when she got around this being, all these hours would disappear.
[03:47:04.370 --> 03:47:05.610]  They'd land back in their car.
[03:47:06.489 --> 03:47:10.989]  Well, there are all these reports out of New Jersey that all the people watching the drones are losing time.
[03:47:12.049 --> 03:47:17.110]  You know, there's all the reports about flickering lights in all these states where the drones go over.
[03:47:17.309 --> 03:47:18.989]  Is that an apotheum effect?
[03:47:19.149 --> 03:47:21.250]  Are they working aspects of that apotheum effect?
[03:47:21.430 --> 03:47:22.750]  These are the crucial questions.
[03:47:22.750 --> 03:47:25.829]  So we're going to get into it more on the show, of course.
[03:47:26.010 --> 03:47:26.829]  I'm a dark journalist.
