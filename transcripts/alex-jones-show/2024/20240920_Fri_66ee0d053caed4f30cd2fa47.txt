[00:00:19.028 --> 00:00:26.772]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, September 20th, 2024, and all hell is breaking loose.
[00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:27.673]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:00:30.186 --> 00:00:30.946]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:35.447]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:40.709]  45 days, 14 hours, 59 minutes, 40 seconds.
[00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:42.069]  The most important election in world history.
[00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:43.689]  It is Friday, September 20th, 2024.
[00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:45.970]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.890]  Okay, folks.
[00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.052]  Senator Josh Hawley has come out with a Secret Service whistleblower who works at Mar-a-Lago saying they stood down default
[00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:57.190]  It's an inside job.
[00:00:57.751 --> 00:01:00.814]  I mean, it's just insane beyond even what we saw in Butler.
[00:01:02.035 --> 00:01:03.116]  All right, that's coming up.
[00:01:03.217 --> 00:01:05.499]  And I'm going to play a report from him on Fox News talking about it.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:14.709]  Then Matt Gaetz got a DHS warning, and so did Trump, that there are five hit teams inside the U.S., three foreign, two domestic, actually trying to hunt and kill the president.
[00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:20.582]  Then we've got just so much more today.
[00:01:21.643 --> 00:01:27.125]  Evidence mounting was a laser attack on Trump, but he was up in the lights with his pupils closed.
[00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:29.726]  People back in the dark got their eyes fried.
[00:01:29.746 --> 00:01:34.327]  It's either that or chlorine gas, but things are pointing towards it being lasers.
[00:01:34.387 --> 00:01:35.128]  It's all coming up.
[00:01:35.188 --> 00:01:36.808]  First, Senator Josh Hawley on Fox.
[00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.569]  Senator Josh Hawley joins me now.
[00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:44.131]  Senator, what are you hearing now from people that are speaking to your staff?
[00:01:46.277 --> 00:01:52.379]  Well, what we've heard, Jesse, from new whistleblowers who've come forward about this second assassination attempt on Donald Trump's life.
[00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:53.780]  And here's what they have told us.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.002]  That golf course that the president was playing, Secret Service have guarded that course many, many times.
[00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:07.665]  And what the whistleblower says is, protocol calls for Secret Service to station agents along the places in the course that are known vulnerabilities.
[00:02:07.705 --> 00:02:08.445]  I want to emphasize
[00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:10.665]  The service has guarded this course many times.
[00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:12.806]  They know where there are vulnerabilities.
[00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:19.727]  They normally station agents there ahead of Trump's appearance on the course, but they apparently did not do that this last weekend.
[00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:22.208]  And the whistleblowers tell me that's strange.
[00:02:22.288 --> 00:02:23.468]  That's out of protocol.
[00:02:23.548 --> 00:02:24.448]  It's not even clear.
[00:02:24.488 --> 00:02:27.949]  Secret Service swept the perimeter before Trump took to the course.
[00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.549]  Also a broach, a breach rather, of protocol.
[00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.890]  And they want to know why, and so do I. I think the Secret Service deserves to give us answers.
[00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:40.553]  We're hearing conflicting reports about who fired off those rounds at Ruth.
[00:02:40.954 --> 00:02:47.523]  Was it a guy sweeping the perimeter during the round, or was it the advance team who was a hole ahead?
[00:02:47.824 --> 00:02:50.027]  Do we have any understanding of what the truth is there?
[00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:52.776]  I don't think we do yet.
[00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:53.797]  Certainly I don't.
[00:02:53.837 --> 00:02:57.500]  And again, the Secret Service, the FBI, DHS have not been forthcoming on this.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.523]  Jesse, I want to emphasize we are over two months, of course, since Butler.
[00:03:01.563 --> 00:03:08.608]  Do you know that the Secret Service still has not given congressional investigators the documents and evidence we have been asking for for two months?
[00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:11.471]  Two months since Trump was shot in the face.
[00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:18.773]  Now he has been shot at, or nearly so, again, and still Secret Service is stonewalling right down to this hour.
[00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:20.934]  I mean, what is going on here?
[00:03:21.394 --> 00:03:26.255]  They need to level with us, they need to level with the American people, and they need to tell us what in the world is happening.
[00:03:26.275 --> 00:03:32.177]  I mean, even your colleagues, pretty partisan colleagues on the left, Blumenthal, even he's just had it.
[00:03:32.977 --> 00:03:42.381]  So, we're also hearing, and this is new, tell me if you've heard this as well, that the Secret Service told the locals in Butler, oh no no, we got the roof, don't worry about the roof, we got it.
[00:03:42.841 --> 00:03:43.781]  Is that what you heard too?
[00:03:43.801 --> 00:03:44.902]  Because they didn't get it.
[00:03:45.382 --> 00:03:58.127]  You know, I saw this in Senator Grassley's recent report and I can tell you, Jesse, I can confirm that local law enforcement in Butler, local whistleblowers, have told me in my office that Secret Service
[00:03:58.667 --> 00:04:04.912]  was indeed the one that took, of course, the planning lead on the day, and that Secret Service was supposed to be in charge of securing that location.
[00:04:05.393 --> 00:04:05.993]  And they didn't do it.
[00:04:06.013 --> 00:04:12.018]  And I tell you what, local law enforcement has been extremely upset, to put it mildly, for months now, that they've been blamed.
[00:04:12.078 --> 00:04:16.942]  That Secret Service went public, blamed the locals, and the locals say, it wasn't our responsibility.
[00:04:17.342 --> 00:04:18.563]  Secret Service was supposed to do it.
[00:04:18.603 --> 00:04:23.748]  Jesse, the local police even offered Secret Service drones on the day in Butler.
[00:04:24.268 --> 00:04:25.109]  Secret Service said no.
[00:04:26.615 --> 00:04:33.075]  Do you believe in your heart that the Secret Service is just incompetent or they're compromised?
[00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:47.222]  You know, all I can say is, folks, look, for two months, you won't answer questions in public, you won't give congressional investigators any documents or evidence, you won't comply with the most basic requests for information.
[00:04:47.282 --> 00:04:47.942]  He lied to Congress.
[00:04:47.962 --> 00:04:49.284]  There's a lot of troubling questions.
[00:04:49.464 --> 00:04:51.686]  It's a stonewall, Jesse, that's all there is to it.
[00:04:51.746 --> 00:04:53.227]  Our country is in a state of war.
[00:04:53.327 --> 00:04:57.952]  I don't know why they're stonewalling, but it can't be good, and it's time for them to come clean.
[00:04:58.132 --> 00:04:58.892]  It's unacceptable.
[00:04:59.113 --> 00:05:02.595]  And again, great job with your office communicating with these whistleblowers.
[00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:04.616]  It's the only way we're getting the truth out there.
[00:05:04.716 --> 00:05:05.716]  Thank you, Senator Hawley.
[00:05:06.517 --> 00:05:07.497]  All right, we'll be back.
[00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:09.098]  It's all at infowars.com.
[00:05:09.138 --> 00:05:09.518]  Share it.
[00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:12.800]  Global domination is the name of the game.
[00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:25.027]  There are three major power blocs, the Communist Chinese, the Russians, and the Anglo-American establishment, that is, the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe.
[00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:30.361]  And the particular dominant group is the Anglo-American establishment.
[00:05:30.381 --> 00:05:32.203]  That's what they call themselves, what the Russians call it.
[00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:34.645]  Goes back 900 years.
[00:05:36.066 --> 00:05:39.489]  This long-term fight that has continually been going on.
[00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:47.154]  And the end of the old financial system is happening now.
[00:05:47.315 --> 00:05:51.258]  They want to launch the new global system right now.
[00:05:53.118 --> 00:05:57.862]  And quite frankly, all the major power blocs are pushing the same casual society control grid.
[00:06:00.305 --> 00:06:08.192]  Now, we have so much insane news today, with only 45 days left for the most important election in world history.
[00:06:08.212 --> 00:06:12.556]  And we've got the 76 days when President Trump is President-elect.
[00:06:14.217 --> 00:06:19.322]  So let me tell you what is coming up here today.
[00:06:21.018 --> 00:06:31.001]  We have the head of Rasmussen polling, which is one of the most respected polling groups in the world, joining us at the start of the next hour.
[00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:36.582]  Mark Mitchell's their head of polling, their vice president.
[00:06:37.182 --> 00:06:40.003]  He's one of the top pollsters in the world, the most accurate on record.
[00:06:41.003 --> 00:06:46.104]  And Kamala is collapsing in all the battleground states, particularly Pennsylvania and Georgia.
[00:06:46.705 --> 00:06:48.025]  That makes them even more desperate.
[00:06:49.403 --> 00:06:53.646]  He's going to go through all this breaking news in 53 minutes from now.
[00:06:56.527 --> 00:07:00.110]  Now, let me tell you what we've got for you.
[00:07:03.952 --> 00:07:09.816]  Jack Posobiec, Mark Mitchell, Mike Adams, myself, Jay Dyer.
[00:07:11.377 --> 00:07:11.737]  Okay.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.361]  We're in a war.
[00:07:16.621 --> 00:07:17.341]  We're peaceful.
[00:07:17.802 --> 00:07:23.366]  We're in information war with the truth and justice and common sense and prosperity and security and love of God and country and family.
[00:07:25.788 --> 00:07:28.730]  We're selling delicious ice water in the Sahara for free.
[00:07:29.531 --> 00:07:31.833]  They're selling cyanide in the Sahara.
[00:07:33.674 --> 00:07:35.295]  We're handing out coats at the North Pole.
[00:07:35.676 --> 00:07:36.696]  They're trying to take people's clothes.
[00:07:36.897 --> 00:07:38.518]  I mean, it's that cut and dry.
[00:07:38.538 --> 00:07:39.759]  The globals want you to eat bugs.
[00:07:39.799 --> 00:07:41.120]  They want you to own nothing and have nothing.
[00:07:43.063 --> 00:07:45.524]  They believe it's their right to rule and dominate and have full power.
[00:07:46.444 --> 00:07:56.987]  And there's nothing more frustrating than knowing the enemy plan, reading their books and articles and white papers, and watching their meetings, and how public they are about the future is non-human, everybody will be sterile by 2040s.
[00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:07.570]  I can play you the clips, WFUN, world government, we own your bodies, you're gonna be nanotech, we're injecting you with nanotech, and then they deny they're doing it when we say don't do it.
[00:08:13.083 --> 00:08:13.804]  We're in a war.
[00:08:13.984 --> 00:08:15.805]  The globalists are not just at war with us.
[00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:22.591]  They're at war with every population, every family, every individual over your freedom, over your right to control your own destiny.
[00:08:22.611 --> 00:08:26.974]  They want you to be a cog in their machine while you're useful as they slowly kill you.
[00:08:29.637 --> 00:08:40.846]  So, to talk about the war front and all these top Democrats saying ban free speech, put Trump supporters in jail for their speech, Gavin Newsom signing laws to do it,
[00:08:53.038 --> 00:08:57.363]  You have to understand that the enemy's losing and they know they're losing.
[00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:00.946]  So here's what we've got on the plate today.
[00:09:02.668 --> 00:09:07.193]  Matt Gaetz comes out yesterday afternoon and says DHS briefed him.
[00:09:07.233 --> 00:09:07.874]  That's Mayorkas.
[00:09:10.219 --> 00:09:12.060]  Just as bad as the Justice Department, two peas in a pod.
[00:09:12.681 --> 00:09:17.544]  That there are five hit teams confirmed in America, three foreign, two domestic.
[00:09:18.185 --> 00:09:19.546]  You know, those are all globalist cutouts.
[00:09:20.046 --> 00:09:22.408]  They can just fund a group that thinks they're working for Iran or Russia.
[00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:23.328]  They really work for the globalists.
[00:09:26.591 --> 00:09:28.412]  What's the plot of every James Bond movie?
[00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:34.176]  There's a terror group that's about to carry out a terror attack and blame somebody else or start a war.
[00:09:35.897 --> 00:09:36.778]  And who wrote those books?
[00:09:36.838 --> 00:09:39.039]  Ian Fleming, the deputy head of OSS and then MI6.
[00:09:41.254 --> 00:09:44.235]  And he gave speeches and wrote articles saying this is the kind of stuff we saw really happen.
[00:09:49.198 --> 00:09:51.539]  What's Vault 7 that Snowden released?
[00:09:51.579 --> 00:09:54.020]  It's all the CIA spoofing hack attacks.
[00:09:54.941 --> 00:09:58.763]  Spoofing death threats posing as somebody else.
[00:09:59.163 --> 00:09:59.783]  False flagging.
[00:10:02.625 --> 00:10:04.906]  Hillary said when she was running in 2016, if there's one
[00:10:06.932 --> 00:10:08.493]  Cyber attack will nuke Russia.
[00:10:08.553 --> 00:10:09.494]  Well, you can spoof that.
[00:10:09.514 --> 00:10:11.476]  You can frame that so easy.
[00:10:12.757 --> 00:10:14.478]  And we have the CIA documents where they do it.
[00:10:16.219 --> 00:10:22.044]  I've had the Feds plant child porn on our computers and then do discovery to find it and try to claim it's me.
[00:10:22.064 --> 00:10:24.145]  But even the FBI came out and said Jones is the victim of this.
[00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.827]  It was planted on the computers.
[00:10:26.847 --> 00:10:29.930]  Of course it was.
[00:10:31.792 --> 00:10:33.153]  So there's some good people in the government.
[00:10:33.173 --> 00:10:34.134]  It's a lot bad.
[00:10:34.594 --> 00:10:35.134]  It's a war.
[00:10:35.194 --> 00:10:37.356]  It's a civil war between good versus evil.
[00:10:37.936 --> 00:10:41.178]  They're trying to make it a civil war, white versus black.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.321]  No, it's the people against the establishment.
[00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:47.203]  You know, I got clips of Petey saying, we're in a Trump's evil.
[00:10:47.243 --> 00:10:49.504]  We're going to have a black against white race war because of Trump.
[00:10:49.784 --> 00:10:53.047]  Trump's just trying to empower the country and unify us.
[00:10:55.168 --> 00:10:56.029]  So here's what's going on.
[00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.492]  Just today, just the last 24 hours, five
[00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:18.838]  Hit teams, three foreign, two domestic, we're told, by DHS has been standing down and all the rest of it at these Trump assassinations, saying confirmed, not speculation, not chatter, five hit teams with 45 days left of the election are in the U.S.
[00:11:18.858 --> 00:11:19.638]  trying to kill Trump.
[00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:25.961]  Then Senator Josh Hawley released this last night.
[00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:27.779]  I had the letter.
[00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:29.181]  He's been on Fox talking about it.
[00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:38.147]  A Secret Service agent came to him, and I've got his letter right here, and said, we've been there at Mar-a-Lago for years.
[00:11:40.729 --> 00:11:41.490]  They stood down.
[00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.211]  They always do sweeps of the woods.
[00:11:43.992 --> 00:11:48.875]  When he plays golf, they put people basically right at the spot and other spots where you can come to the woods and shoot Trump.
[00:11:50.616 --> 00:11:51.577]  And there was a stand down.
[00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:56.461]  And it appears the Secret Service was working with the shooter.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.701]  That's kind of a big deal.
[00:12:02.763 --> 00:12:23.199]  Then, we've got a week and a half after it happened, two Sundays ago, Trump's in Tucson, and 20 of the people, that's all there were, it was 20 to the left, 20 to the right, on the corner of the stage behind him where he came in and where he left,
[00:12:27.133 --> 00:12:28.895]  Some of them still can't see.
[00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:30.096]  Their retinas have been burned.
[00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:40.265]  Their eyes have been burned, and that could be chlorine gas or some other type of gas, or it could be an infrared laser, which you can't see with the naked eye.
[00:12:40.285 --> 00:12:53.977]  You can put a certain type of dust into the air that does reflect it, and then you'll see it shimmer, but you don't see an infrared laser.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.922]  It's like you can't see infrared in sunlight.
[00:12:59.183 --> 00:13:06.168]  There's a full band of light in sunlight, and the infrared is in the not visible light spectrum, but will burn you.
[00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:11.873]  They've got infrared lasers they use to work on electronics and finish microchips.
[00:13:13.414 --> 00:13:20.699]  If you've seen the movie Elysium, when he works the robot factory, type in robot factory accident Elysium, it'll come up.
[00:13:21.039 --> 00:13:21.560]  Matt Damon
[00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:26.061]  Robot factory accident.
[00:13:27.722 --> 00:13:38.667]  Our Matt Damon gets fried in Robot Factory, and you notice it's a high-powered laser slash, also radiation, that they fire into the chips.
[00:13:38.687 --> 00:13:40.807]  But the point is, is that you don't see it.
[00:13:44.469 --> 00:13:49.011]  And that's a perfect weapon, and the Russians have it, the Chinese have it, the UK has it, the US, they all have it.
[00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:50.931]  We've got ships with it, everything.
[00:13:51.052 --> 00:13:54.513]  We've had US ships and aircraft hit with infrared lasers.
[00:13:59.997 --> 00:14:02.617]  And again, that's what's the light in the sunlight that burns you.
[00:14:03.998 --> 00:14:05.258]  So, there's that.
[00:14:05.278 --> 00:14:22.201]  And I was saying, you can put two tablets, the type of chemicals you need, in a bottle of water, close it, have the tablets in your pocket, have the bottle of water, go into the rally, pop it in, release it, and then that gas rises up and burns your eyes.
[00:14:22.281 --> 00:14:25.901]  But it's even better, you can have something that looks like a light, because it is a light.
[00:14:25.921 --> 00:14:28.622]  That's what a laser is, direct to different type of focused light.
[00:14:30.583 --> 00:14:33.144]  Or you can have it even look like a camera and it's aimed right at Trump.
[00:14:34.225 --> 00:14:36.006]  You ask, why wouldn't his eyes be burned?
[00:14:36.026 --> 00:14:39.988]  Well, they might've been Trump's just acting like he's tough and isn't affecting him.
[00:14:40.948 --> 00:14:45.871]  I didn't notice he's been squinting a lot lately and looks like he's not too happy.
[00:14:49.413 --> 00:14:54.135]  But the people directly behind him got fried from the angle.
[00:14:57.077 --> 00:14:57.277]  So
[00:14:59.557 --> 00:15:00.597]  I think Mike Adams is right.
[00:15:00.637 --> 00:15:01.318]  He's an engineer.
[00:15:01.418 --> 00:15:02.418]  This looks like laser.
[00:15:03.758 --> 00:15:05.399]  Hospitals are saying these people can't see.
[00:15:05.679 --> 00:15:06.319]  Their eyes are burned.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.060]  So, we've got that.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.381]  That just illustrates for you how crazy everything is.
[00:15:15.422 --> 00:15:23.824]  And remember what I said back on the 13th of July, what I've said since then, what I said this week, what I said last week before they tried to kill him again in Palm Beach at his golf course outside Mar-a-Lago.
[00:15:25.973 --> 00:15:30.615]  I said, for every assassination attempt you know about, I guarantee you there's three or four you don't.
[00:15:30.675 --> 00:15:31.536]  That's an exact quote.
[00:15:32.496 --> 00:15:49.784]  Now we learn five professional hit teams, not one, not two, not three, not four, five hit teams are inside the United States with a mission to kill Trump, and they won't say who.
[00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:50.285]  Well, you know.
[00:15:50.765 --> 00:15:53.006]  They're gonna say the Iranians.
[00:15:53.646 --> 00:15:54.907]  They're gonna say Hamas.
[00:15:56.698 --> 00:15:57.599]  That's being done
[00:16:20.433 --> 00:16:34.908]  So that when they kill Trump, they can blame it on the Iranians or the Russians, which I've been saying before they tried to shoot Trump last week and before they hit him in the ear, grazed him two months and eight days ago in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[00:16:38.888 --> 00:16:45.974]  I said they will start blaming Iran for the next assassination attempt, and three days later they did it on the 16th.
[00:16:46.654 --> 00:16:47.295]  Black clockwork.
[00:16:47.975 --> 00:16:49.316]  That's all I do is wargame this.
[00:16:49.877 --> 00:16:51.378]  I see all the pre-programming that's already there.
[00:16:55.441 --> 00:16:56.182]  You can see it as well.
[00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:58.524]  Everybody else can see it.
[00:16:59.444 --> 00:17:04.849]  And now you got senators going, yeah, they stood down in Butler, they stood down in Florida.
[00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:05.950]  Of course they did.
[00:17:06.755 --> 00:17:10.157]  This is the human trafficking demon Mayorkas and Kamala.
[00:17:10.177 --> 00:17:12.359]  I mean, they won't even give Trump regular Secret Service.
[00:17:14.841 --> 00:17:16.542]  President gets hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[00:17:16.962 --> 00:17:18.543]  His stupid wife gets hundreds.
[00:17:19.484 --> 00:17:22.646]  Trump usually has about 15 Secret Service agents now.
[00:17:24.847 --> 00:17:28.250]  But they've got all the cops wanting to help him, but they won't even work with them, we now learn.
[00:17:29.504 --> 00:17:33.705]  Under default orders of Ronald Rowe, who lied to Congress, says he doesn't know who stood down.
[00:17:34.005 --> 00:17:34.925]  He doesn't know what happened.
[00:17:34.945 --> 00:17:38.586]  Turned out he took full control of Butler and ordered everybody off the site.
[00:17:39.006 --> 00:17:40.046]  Wouldn't put people on the roof.
[00:17:42.287 --> 00:17:44.927]  Wouldn't let them sync their radio channels, which is standard.
[00:17:47.188 --> 00:17:51.329]  That's like a bank manager leaving the door open and the vault open when he leaves at six o'clock at night.
[00:17:52.386 --> 00:17:58.449]  And then the cops look at the surveillance camera and go, the front door's open, the vault's open, let's look at the surveillance cameras and see who left it open.
[00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:07.615]  And the cops zoom in, the FBI zooms in and notices, wait, the vault managers just acted like he hit the code on the vault and locked it.
[00:18:07.655 --> 00:18:08.015]  He didn't.
[00:18:08.035 --> 00:18:09.055]  They go check the computer record.
[00:18:09.496 --> 00:18:10.336]  You're indicted, buddy.
[00:18:10.356 --> 00:18:11.977]  And then they get his information.
[00:18:11.997 --> 00:18:17.160]  They find out off geolocating with a cell phone and that he's been meeting with the bank robbers for two months.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.901]  You're going to the pen, buddy.
[00:18:20.851 --> 00:18:21.712]  It's the same thing here.
[00:18:22.612 --> 00:18:25.794]  They opened the gates, they did it all, it's right there.
[00:18:26.094 --> 00:18:29.416]  You have to do mental gymnastics not to see how that's happened.
[00:18:31.097 --> 00:18:36.620]  So they're laying the groundwork to truck bomb or drone attack or missile his airplane out of the sky.
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.962]  Ooh, super professional, five groups, three foreign governments.
[00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:43.084]  They're here, they're gonna kill Trump.
[00:18:44.301 --> 00:19:01.275]  So that when they have a more professional, not just some brainwashed leftist that they wound up and protected and trained, just like the Butler shooter, or trained in Ukraine and under CIA, like the Florida would-be shooter.
[00:19:05.438 --> 00:19:09.822]  No, now they're gonna bring in their professional teams and say, oh, the Iranians did it.
[00:19:10.745 --> 00:19:15.509]  And then Americans will get so pissed when Trump's dead, some of them will believe it and go, that's right, let's nuke them right now!
[00:19:20.914 --> 00:19:24.056]  That's 45 days out.
[00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:27.699]  45 days out, and this is what we're dealing with.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.504]  And we've got all these Democrats passing laws to ban free speech in California.
[00:19:33.524 --> 00:19:38.969]  Hillary's saying arrest Trump supporters for their quote, disinfo, that she decides what's disinfo while she lies constantly.
[00:19:45.086 --> 00:19:54.073]  And you got Kamala coming out with a video last night saying, I've never wanted your guns, and Tim Walz doesn't want your guns, and if somebody breaks my house, I'm gonna kill them.
[00:19:55.394 --> 00:20:01.319]  Meanwhile, we've got a huge compilation of her saying she'll ban the guns, but she says in the same speech, though I do want to ban semi-autos.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.463]  I'm not gonna ban your guns, I'm just gonna ban most guns, there's, you know, that's the semi-autos.
[00:20:07.104 --> 00:20:14.190]  And then, just to give you a little flavor of where we're at, because any other talk show host would be talking about this non-stop, and
[00:20:16.288 --> 00:20:22.583]  I'm going to hit this now and then get back into all this and give you breaking inside intel with Jack Posobiec coming up here in 10 minutes.
[00:20:25.896 --> 00:20:27.957]  But I want to show you this first for your TV viewer.
[00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:33.438]  People have been asking me what's going on for 11 weeks since the Feds tried to shut us down illegally without a court order.
[00:20:34.239 --> 00:20:41.721]  The judge found out that the Justice Department appointed through the court, because they wanted to come into my case, this is very rare, a U.S.
[00:20:41.761 --> 00:20:49.723]  trustee, ordered this place shut outside law, and the judge fired her and fired the CRO that I've been dealing with for a year and a half, sabotaging the hell out of this place.
[00:20:50.464 --> 00:20:51.284]  What broke last night?
[00:20:52.858 --> 00:20:53.819]  People hear this like, really?
[00:20:53.839 --> 00:20:55.640]  No court order?
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.060]  Ready for this?
[00:20:58.601 --> 00:21:01.083]  Wall Street Journal, New York Times, all over the news right now.
[00:21:01.543 --> 00:21:01.963]  Bloomberg.
[00:21:03.504 --> 00:21:08.667]  Alex Jones bankruptcy trustee sales efforts challenged by the DOJ.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:16.612]  Now, it's very cut and dry that the assets of free speech systems, the website, the equipment,
[00:21:18.902 --> 00:21:33.987]  The shopping cart, all that can be sold, and they know full well that there are a bunch of Patriot buyers, and then the operation continues on, and the Sandy Hook Democrat Party front group, run by the CIA on record, it's come out, and FBI, in court, the FBI ran the whole thing, in court!
[00:21:35.327 --> 00:21:36.888]  During the fake trial, the Bureau of Authority found guilty.
[00:21:38.488 --> 00:21:40.289]  They said, we don't want money, we want him shut down.
[00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:47.794]  And they plan to own my name now in filings and any social media even though the president says they don't.
[00:21:47.834 --> 00:21:48.474]  They're going to try.
[00:21:48.534 --> 00:21:49.054]  I've got to fight them.
[00:21:52.116 --> 00:21:53.117]  So here's Bloomberg.
[00:21:54.938 --> 00:21:57.900]  Alex Jones bankruptcy trustee sale efforts challenged by DOJ.
[00:21:58.661 --> 00:21:59.561]  Info wars for sale.
[00:21:59.601 --> 00:22:02.103]  Alex Jones assets again debated in bankruptcy court.
[00:22:03.244 --> 00:22:03.864]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:22:05.905 --> 00:22:09.768]  So you heard back in June personal assets to be sold but company bankruptcy dismissed.
[00:22:11.064 --> 00:22:12.245]  I'm in personal bankruptcy.
[00:22:12.405 --> 00:22:13.506]  I own free speech systems.
[00:22:14.787 --> 00:22:23.833]  Under most of the precedent, I'm able to agree to that with the new trustee, who's been fair and nice so far, and not gotten in our way, let us keep operating.
[00:22:24.234 --> 00:22:25.755]  So now we're actually in the black some.
[00:22:29.926 --> 00:22:37.610]  But yes, if there is an LLC, you can't force its sale even in bankruptcy, but I'm in bankruptcy, so you can.
[00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:41.331]  But the federal government has come into my bankruptcy.
[00:22:41.351 --> 00:22:42.572]  I told them they've been involved in the whole thing.
[00:22:42.872 --> 00:22:47.454]  They come to the depositions and threaten me and say, if you say one thing wrong, you're going to jail and read U.S.
[00:22:47.494 --> 00:22:50.136]  codes to me, trying to scare me, as if I've done something wrong.
[00:22:50.296 --> 00:22:51.296]  I'm literally a Boy Scout.
[00:22:52.617 --> 00:22:54.097]  All I've had is mainline accountants and CPAs.
[00:22:54.157 --> 00:22:55.118]  I don't even touch the money.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.203]  They lied and said hundreds of millions of dollars, I was going to go to jail.
[00:22:58.223 --> 00:22:58.864]  Remember that?
[00:22:58.884 --> 00:23:01.207]  Now, New York Times, Alex Jones had meager assets.
[00:23:01.527 --> 00:23:02.128]  We were wrong.
[00:23:02.309 --> 00:23:04.011]  Yeah, he's made all that stuff up.
[00:23:05.313 --> 00:23:12.543]  So, what I do have is a giant audience and kick-ass listeners and activists and amazing researchers and we're fighting the new order.
[00:23:12.563 --> 00:23:13.184]  That's what we are.
[00:23:18.504 --> 00:23:20.346]  So everybody hears, oh, it's shutting down.
[00:23:20.426 --> 00:23:22.127]  It's in the news that it shut down 10 weeks ago.
[00:23:22.328 --> 00:23:23.088]  And then it didn't happen.
[00:23:23.108 --> 00:23:24.710]  People are like, what's going on?
[00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:32.497]  They illegally, outside of law, vigilantes from the Justice Department came in here and ordered the place shut down with private security coming in.
[00:23:32.517 --> 00:23:33.598]  And I told them, I'm calling the police.
[00:23:33.618 --> 00:23:34.118]  You can't do that.
[00:23:34.479 --> 00:23:36.681]  Had basically a standoff for three days.
[00:23:37.682 --> 00:23:38.743]  People at first, like, is he kidding?
[00:23:38.763 --> 00:23:39.884]  People, our government doesn't do that.
[00:23:40.124 --> 00:23:42.967]  Oh, the government doesn't ban speech in California and felonies?
[00:23:45.373 --> 00:23:47.795]  Hillary didn't get on TV and say she wants to put us in jail for her speech.
[00:23:47.815 --> 00:23:48.795]  You're damn right they are.
[00:23:49.115 --> 00:23:50.716]  You're damn right they're trying to kill Trump.
[00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:52.798]  We are not in Kansas anymore.
[00:23:53.558 --> 00:23:54.479]  We are in a war.
[00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:55.880]  The new world order is coming down on us.
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:56.840]  They've dissolved the border.
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:00.122]  They're human trafficking children and sex slavery and slave labor.
[00:24:01.983 --> 00:24:02.644]  The sky.
[00:24:02.784 --> 00:24:04.185]  They're starting World War III with the Russians.
[00:24:04.205 --> 00:24:05.245]  They already started it.
[00:24:05.906 --> 00:24:06.686]  The sky's the limit.
[00:24:10.028 --> 00:24:11.069]  So what have they filed?
[00:24:11.849 --> 00:24:14.091]  Well, the feds filed they don't want the bill to be sold.
[00:24:16.704 --> 00:24:17.965]  And they just want it closed.
[00:24:20.566 --> 00:24:21.547]  And they want it closed.
[00:24:21.827 --> 00:24:24.149]  You can't make this up in the first week of November.
[00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:30.553]  What are they going to do in that 76 days that they want the real Alex Jones on X?
[00:24:31.633 --> 00:24:34.355]  My personal thing I've had for 17 years, nothing to do with them.
[00:24:34.735 --> 00:24:36.577]  I promote InfoWars on it, but it's mine.
[00:24:37.317 --> 00:24:38.598]  The terms of service say they can't have it.
[00:24:38.618 --> 00:24:39.799]  There's no court cases they can get it.
[00:24:40.299 --> 00:24:44.782]  They don't care because they want me off air with whatever they're going to pull.
[00:24:47.483 --> 00:24:51.946]  So, just like when they tried to do this 11 weeks ago, I said, they're getting ready to kill Trump.
[00:24:51.966 --> 00:24:52.666]  This isn't about me.
[00:24:52.746 --> 00:24:54.227]  The orders have come.
[00:24:54.347 --> 00:24:55.488]  They had the Justice Department.
[00:24:56.909 --> 00:25:06.694]  When I first filed for bankruptcy and free speech, send a letter to the lawyers we had that got scared and quit, big ones, saying, this comes from the president.
[00:25:07.275 --> 00:25:08.976]  He will not be afforded the bankruptcy system.
[00:25:12.418 --> 00:25:13.078]  I had witnesses.
[00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:14.279]  They had the emails.
[00:25:15.879 --> 00:25:16.539]  They're so arrogant.
[00:25:16.559 --> 00:25:17.179]  They send emails.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.200]  This ain't America, buddy.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:19.981]  You don't get any freedom.
[00:25:21.581 --> 00:25:23.742]  So that's where we are.
[00:25:24.842 --> 00:25:25.563]  So here's the deal.
[00:25:25.803 --> 00:25:29.224]  Without getting into all the minutiae, I need your support.
[00:25:29.644 --> 00:25:31.645]  I need your aid, like Travis at the Alamo.
[00:25:33.205 --> 00:25:34.066]  I need your support.
[00:25:34.106 --> 00:25:37.527]  I need you to go to our sponsor, drjonesnaturals.com, and get great products that are amazing.
[00:25:37.547 --> 00:25:44.630]  I need you to go to m4warstore.com, and I need you to go to thealexjonesstore.com and get amazing Patriot t-shirts.
[00:25:45.569 --> 00:25:49.272]  So that we have the funding and sponsors and everything to go into the future.
[00:25:49.312 --> 00:25:52.955]  Regardless, it is beyond critical.
[00:25:52.975 --> 00:25:56.658]  We're going to show you some B-roll here of the new t-shirts that have come in.
[00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:00.941]  Now these are best sellers already and those are great.
[00:26:03.423 --> 00:26:06.285]  But I tell you what, those are the t-shirts that came in a few weeks ago.
[00:26:06.305 --> 00:26:06.985]  They're great too.
[00:26:07.025 --> 00:26:09.707]  You just go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:26:09.727 --> 00:26:11.569]  We'll punch up the actual website on there.
[00:26:12.625 --> 00:26:13.706]  You can see the newest.
[00:26:13.726 --> 00:26:14.466]  Now look at those, look at those.
[00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:19.388]  Look at that, look at that royal blue with the classic join or die.
[00:26:19.628 --> 00:26:20.509]  I designed that baby.
[00:26:20.529 --> 00:26:22.089]  I mean, that's, I said, that's what I want.
[00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:23.590]  And it says join or die.
[00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:27.432]  And then it says realalexjones.com.
[00:26:28.733 --> 00:26:30.053]  A site we'll be hearing a lot about in the future.
[00:26:31.034 --> 00:26:37.096]  Then we've got the fourth anniversary for 2020 of Space Force being officially launched.
[00:26:38.037 --> 00:26:40.018]  The Classic Tierney Response Team is back.
[00:26:41.423 --> 00:26:44.845]  And a classic shirt I designed more than 15 years ago.
[00:26:44.885 --> 00:26:46.106]  We haven't sold for over a decade.
[00:26:46.506 --> 00:27:00.195]  A big old jointer die on army tan green olive drab with the snake starting at your down at your stomach on the right up to your over your heart to the left.
[00:27:01.616 --> 00:27:03.117]  The don't snack on me shirt.
[00:27:03.817 --> 00:27:08.840]  Now more than 50 incredible original designs at the alexjonestore.com.
[00:27:09.981 --> 00:27:10.121]  Now,
[00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:13.542]  The enemy wants this shutdown for a reason.
[00:27:14.123 --> 00:27:18.666]  And believe me, I'm running around, got a lot of stuff going on I'm not going to tell the enemy about because they're watching too.
[00:27:19.506 --> 00:27:29.212]  But if you want to put your money where it has the biggest effect against the globalists and stops them, you need to flood us with support at thealexjonestore.com.
[00:27:30.868 --> 00:27:36.053]  DrJonesNaturals.com and InfoWarStore.com.
[00:27:36.753 --> 00:27:37.954]  I've fired the bat signal.
[00:27:38.094 --> 00:27:39.275]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands.
[00:27:39.736 --> 00:27:42.018]  I respectfully am asking for your aid and comfort.
[00:27:42.318 --> 00:27:44.160]  Will you give it to me in our time of need?
[00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:46.970]  I'll never back down, but I could give out.
[00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.971]  I need your help now.
[00:27:48.391 --> 00:27:52.032]  This bad boy is the number one seller at thealexshownstore.com.
[00:27:52.312 --> 00:27:55.152]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:27:55.612 --> 00:27:56.213]  Folks love it.
[00:27:56.413 --> 00:27:56.833]  I love it.
[00:27:56.933 --> 00:28:04.454]  I love wearing this out in public, and it also lets the globals to let us know we are standing up against them, and we know who they serve, and we know who we serve.
[00:28:04.615 --> 00:28:14.857]  The black rock globalist controlled left, from academia to the media, is obsessed with bullying you into silence because their ideas are illegal and unpopular.
[00:28:15.117 --> 00:28:16.998]  And if you simply speak up, it's game over.
[00:28:17.298 --> 00:28:21.060]  So stop thinking it's just Alex Jones or Tucker Carlson or Donald Trump to save the world.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.340]  It's all of us together.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:25.282]  And wearing t-shirts in public that promote freedom is key.
[00:28:25.502 --> 00:28:26.922]  It doesn't just show our enemies who are awake.
[00:28:27.343 --> 00:28:30.604]  Other people see it and realize how popular freedom is.
[00:28:31.044 --> 00:28:32.865]  So ladies and gentlemen, it's a win-win.
[00:28:33.165 --> 00:28:39.168]  Get great shirts at thealexjonesstore.com, fund the operations, we fight the tyrants at point blank range, and
[00:28:39.548 --> 00:28:42.489]  Meet like-minded people and spread the word of the third dimension.
[00:28:42.529 --> 00:28:45.290]  Take action now and don't let the left silence you.
[00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:46.570]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[00:28:48.411 --> 00:28:54.113]  Make no mistake, all this crazy stuff's happening because the globalists are losing control very quickly.
[00:28:56.333 --> 00:29:04.716]  And even if they're able to take out the leadership of the liberty movement here in the United States and other countries, it's a pyrrhic victory because they will be destroyed in the process.
[00:29:06.058 --> 00:29:10.483]  I would tell the globalists they need to back off, they need to surrender, they need to sue for peace, and they need to capitulate.
[00:29:12.525 --> 00:29:19.292]  Now, Jack is stuck in traffic, he's almost home, he'll be on with us in a few minutes.
[00:29:19.552 --> 00:29:25.078]  Jack Masovic's got a bunch of big intel on the apparent laser attack on the Trump supporters.
[00:29:26.069 --> 00:29:30.832]  A week and a half ago in Tucson, Arizona, on the five professional hit teams here to kill Trump.
[00:29:31.152 --> 00:29:33.333]  DHS, this is confirmed.
[00:29:33.353 --> 00:29:36.215]  Of course, it's their cover for getting ready to kill Trump.
[00:29:37.115 --> 00:29:41.177]  Josh Hawley in the Secret Service whistleblower on the stand down at Mar-a-Lago last Sunday.
[00:29:43.298 --> 00:29:45.180]  That's only six days ago.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.700]  Seems like six years ago.
[00:29:48.641 --> 00:29:49.882]  And so much more here.
[00:29:50.022 --> 00:29:54.505]  But I want to get into Kamala and her next level gaslighting.
[00:29:55.345 --> 00:29:56.666]  It's spectacular, quite frankly.
[00:29:56.686 --> 00:29:57.767]  Just like, I'm not for fracking.
[00:29:57.787 --> 00:29:58.367]  That's insane.
[00:29:58.407 --> 00:29:58.848]  You're nuts.
[00:29:59.488 --> 00:30:02.110]  There's no Haitians doing anything wrong in Springfield.
[00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:03.071]  You're crazy, Trump.
[00:30:04.272 --> 00:30:07.254]  There's no Venezuelan gangs taking over apartments.
[00:30:07.334 --> 00:30:08.395]  There's no moon in the sky.
[00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:09.676]  There's no sun in the sky.
[00:30:09.796 --> 00:30:11.698]  There's no fish in the ocean.
[00:30:11.798 --> 00:30:12.418]  Freaking nuts!
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.641]  There's no hot dogs at baseball games.
[00:30:19.224 --> 00:30:20.565]  There's no meow in the kitty cats.
[00:30:21.926 --> 00:30:23.147]  There's no boom boom in the gun.
[00:30:24.684 --> 00:30:26.485]  There's no bam-bam in a boxing match.
[00:30:27.746 --> 00:30:29.267]  There's no hut-hut in a football game.
[00:30:30.607 --> 00:30:31.628]  There's no white on rice.
[00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:34.950]  There's no sting in a bee.
[00:30:37.111 --> 00:30:38.131]  There's no flirt in a date.
[00:30:41.713 --> 00:30:43.194]  There's no punch in an ass-kicking.
[00:30:45.495 --> 00:30:46.316]  It just goes on and on.
[00:30:51.138 --> 00:30:52.879]  But first, I never get to this type of stuff.
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.961]  And Trump is known for this very quietly.
[00:30:56.001 --> 00:30:56.862]  He never talks about it.
[00:30:56.882 --> 00:30:57.943]  He got it from his dad.
[00:30:59.104 --> 00:31:05.448]  They were so rough in business with big companies or the mafia they would push around or just any of it.
[00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:13.754]  But people they knew, people they didn't know, when they had tragedies, the Trumps just do this.
[00:31:13.794 --> 00:31:14.394]  It's what they do.
[00:31:14.895 --> 00:31:17.196]  And I've experienced it just a little myself.
[00:31:18.577 --> 00:31:20.659]  And when I got married eight years ago,
[00:31:22.421 --> 00:31:31.404]  Trump gets my wife's cell phone number, calls her, she says, Trump, she's just talking to him like, you know, eight, nine minutes.
[00:31:31.424 --> 00:31:32.624]  I was like, hey, I want to talk to him.
[00:31:33.064 --> 00:31:34.144]  I'm like grabbing the phone away.
[00:31:35.425 --> 00:31:39.626]  And he's just telling her what a great guy I am and what a patron, how lucky she is and blah, blah, blah.
[00:31:39.646 --> 00:31:41.206]  It was just a nice thing to do.
[00:31:41.807 --> 00:31:42.807]  He does that all day long.
[00:31:43.867 --> 00:31:49.149]  So here's a video of the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of dollars at the time they gave this family.
[00:31:50.014 --> 00:31:53.517]  When Trump was going to private school in his primary school.
[00:31:55.098 --> 00:32:01.343]  And here's the father talking about when he was a little kid, what happened when his dad died and what Trump's dad did.
[00:32:01.383 --> 00:32:01.663]  Here it is.
[00:32:02.469 --> 00:32:14.457]  I have an amazing story to tell you real quick about what President Trump's father, Fred Trump, did for myself, for my brother, for my sister, for my mother.
[00:32:14.477 --> 00:32:16.699]  1974, my dad suffered a major heart attack.
[00:32:17.099 --> 00:32:20.101]  I went to the same school as Donald Trump, the Pew Forest School.
[00:32:20.561 --> 00:32:26.745]  Three days after my father's burial, there was a knock on the door one school morning, 7 a.m.
[00:32:27.366 --> 00:32:28.226]  I answered the door.
[00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:29.807]  It was a distinguished gentleman.
[00:32:29.847 --> 00:32:30.808]  I was 10 years old.
[00:32:30.888 --> 00:32:31.889]  My father just died.
[00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:34.811]  Gentleman said, kid, call your mom.
[00:32:35.151 --> 00:32:36.913]  I called my mom from upstairs.
[00:32:36.973 --> 00:32:37.633]  She came down.
[00:32:38.434 --> 00:32:42.398]  Gentleman said to my mom, I am Fred Trump, Donald's father.
[00:32:43.362 --> 00:32:46.124]  And my mom says, yes, I know Donald went to the Kew Forest School.
[00:32:46.544 --> 00:32:51.187]  And Mr. Fred Trump said to my mom, yes, Mrs. Ratton, very sorry about Joseph's death.
[00:32:51.848 --> 00:32:56.171]  And what you don't know is I'm still on the board of trustees at the Kew Forest School.
[00:32:56.631 --> 00:33:12.762]  And this morning, I let headmaster Mr. Philip Rogers know that from this day forward, myself, Fred Trump, out of my own pocket, is going to pay for your three children's tuition because I don't want the kids have to go back into the public school system.
[00:33:15.583 --> 00:33:24.325]  And the tuition in 1974 was $2,500 per child, $7,500, which is about $80,000, $100,000 in today's money.
[00:33:24.785 --> 00:33:28.226]  And who would do that except the President Trump's father?
[00:33:28.527 --> 00:33:32.848]  The fruit doesn't fall far from the tree, and they give the Trump family grief.
[00:33:33.228 --> 00:33:37.629]  The Trump family is a wonderful family, the entire family, sorry.
[00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:39.190]  And who else?
[00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:43.111]  Can you picture Joseph Biden or Kamala Harris doing that?
[00:33:43.291 --> 00:33:44.571]  So, there you go.
[00:34:13.795 --> 00:34:17.378]  And I didn't put in a call to have Trump call when I got remarried.
[00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:21.120]  He just found out about it and that's the kind of stuff he does.
[00:34:21.901 --> 00:34:22.601]  It's crazy.
[00:34:24.983 --> 00:34:26.644]  And he's totally loyal to you, you're not loyal to him.
[00:34:29.206 --> 00:34:32.528]  And that's where we are.
[00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:37.672]  So, it's well known that Hillary, Gavin Newsom, it's in the news.
[00:34:37.772 --> 00:34:38.593]  They never give tips.
[00:34:40.145 --> 00:34:50.590]  When we cover Bilderberg around the world, from Istanbul to England to the U.S., we always get into the hotel a few days before they close it.
[00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:53.711]  We talk to the bartenders and people, and they say, hey, they're going to be really rude and mean.
[00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:56.093]  I know you won't give us info now, but just give us your number.
[00:34:56.673 --> 00:34:58.194]  When you see how horrible they are, you're going to call us.
[00:34:58.214 --> 00:34:59.514]  They go, oh, my God, they're really rude.
[00:34:59.534 --> 00:35:00.235]  They don't give us tips.
[00:35:00.255 --> 00:35:01.395]  They tell us not to look them in the eyes.
[00:35:02.816 --> 00:35:04.617]  We've got these documents in the trash can.
[00:35:04.637 --> 00:35:05.097]  Do you want them?
[00:35:05.117 --> 00:35:06.117]  We'll get the documents.
[00:35:08.138 --> 00:35:09.279]  It's the same thing at Davos.
[00:35:10.543 --> 00:35:11.263]  They hate you.
[00:35:11.283 --> 00:35:14.524]  It's not that they don't care about you, they want to kill you.
[00:35:16.145 --> 00:35:22.647]  They are the most monstrous, evil, greedy... Who wants to cut the energy off and make people poor?
[00:35:22.807 --> 00:35:23.167]  They do.
[00:35:23.867 --> 00:35:27.588]  Who wants to increase taxes on tips and overtime?
[00:35:27.748 --> 00:35:28.428]  They did that.
[00:35:28.728 --> 00:35:29.609]  Trump's gonna get rid of it.
[00:35:30.629 --> 00:35:31.389]  They're jerks.
[00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:34.690]  They're beyond jerks.
[00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:37.911]  They are just... The most horrible thing you can imagine, it's worse.
[00:35:40.134 --> 00:35:56.222]  Get that through your heads, and I know most of you understand that, but I mean, really, we're up against, I mean, the Republicans passed in the House, the Democrats said they're gonna vote against it, they may beat it in the Senate, to deport someone convicted of rape who's an illegal?
[00:35:58.743 --> 00:36:00.484]  The Democrats almost voted to a person?
[00:36:00.504 --> 00:36:04.406]  I have the articles in newsclips, I have the vote, I have video of the vote on C-SPAN.
[00:36:04.726 --> 00:36:05.266]  You wanna see it?
[00:36:07.427 --> 00:36:08.568]  Post it on X, you can watch it.
[00:36:09.571 --> 00:36:10.312]  Yesterday afternoon.
[00:36:13.715 --> 00:36:15.857]  They won't deport rapists?
[00:36:16.277 --> 00:36:17.078]  Convicted?
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.562]  They're, folks, they're villains for real.
[00:36:25.826 --> 00:36:27.627]  And then Kamala, oh, I'm not for fracking.
[00:36:27.707 --> 00:36:29.549]  Dozens of videos and sets policy.
[00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:31.351]  Oh, I'm the best border czar.
[00:36:31.411 --> 00:36:32.171]  I was never the border czar.
[00:36:32.191 --> 00:36:33.052]  Oh, I was a border czar.
[00:36:33.092 --> 00:36:33.933]  Oh, I built the wall.
[00:36:33.993 --> 00:36:35.795]  I mean, the whoppers.
[00:36:38.715 --> 00:36:39.795]  That these people tell.
[00:36:42.676 --> 00:36:47.798]  And we catch so many of the COVID heads in England, the U.S., behind the scenes laughing, oh, it's all fake.
[00:36:48.418 --> 00:36:49.279]  Your immunity's great.
[00:36:49.919 --> 00:36:50.939]  I wouldn't take that shot.
[00:36:50.979 --> 00:36:53.160]  Ha ha ha, we locked everybody up while we had orgies.
[00:36:55.661 --> 00:36:57.702]  You're like, wow, what scum!
[00:36:58.322 --> 00:37:01.023]  And they're giving orders, and they follow the orders, and they get money.
[00:37:01.963 --> 00:37:04.484]  So when you look at this trash, they are the mercenaries.
[00:37:06.425 --> 00:37:07.105]  So here's Kamala.
[00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:15.753]  On Oprah, if somebody breaks into my house, they're going to get shot and then dovetail it with a new video she released, clip four.
[00:37:15.773 --> 00:37:16.333]  So two and four.
[00:37:16.693 --> 00:37:19.534]  Kamala Harris is now branding herself as a staunch Second Amendment supporter.
[00:37:19.554 --> 00:37:22.776]  And then we're going to play what she actually stands for.
[00:37:22.816 --> 00:37:23.096]  Here it is.
[00:37:23.936 --> 00:37:25.277]  I'm a gun owner too.
[00:37:25.417 --> 00:37:26.818]  I did not know that!
[00:37:28.598 --> 00:37:30.859]  If somebody breaks into my house, they're getting shot.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.040]  Yes, yes.
[00:37:33.681 --> 00:37:34.201]  I hear that.
[00:37:34.361 --> 00:37:34.841]  I hear that.
[00:37:35.021 --> 00:37:36.402]  Probably should not have said that.
[00:37:38.891 --> 00:37:44.032]  My staff will deal with that later.
[00:37:44.052 --> 00:37:46.933]  I and Tim Walz are both gun owners.
[00:37:47.213 --> 00:37:49.314]  We will not take anybody's guns away.
[00:37:49.854 --> 00:37:53.915]  We also need to have reasonable gun safety laws.
[00:37:54.335 --> 00:37:56.656]  I believe that we need an assault weapons ban.
[00:37:56.896 --> 00:37:58.517]  We need universal background checks.
[00:37:59.257 --> 00:38:00.557]  We need red flag laws.
[00:38:00.577 --> 00:38:01.437]  I'm a gun owner.
[00:38:01.497 --> 00:38:02.278]  Tim Walz is a gun owner.
[00:38:02.298 --> 00:38:03.178]  I didn't know that!
[00:38:05.054 --> 00:38:07.296]  And somebody breaks in my house, they're getting shot.
[00:38:07.516 --> 00:38:09.317]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:38:09.897 --> 00:38:13.300]  So, it's like she's on Sesame Street or Mr. Rogers.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.440]  She's got a cue card up here.
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.862]  Radio listeners, subscribers, viewers just saw it.
[00:38:18.343 --> 00:38:19.544]  But let's decide what she said.
[00:38:19.844 --> 00:38:20.705]  Oh, I'm for your guns.
[00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:23.286]  I just want to ban assault weapons.
[00:38:23.306 --> 00:38:25.208]  That's all semi-auto, including handguns.
[00:38:26.642 --> 00:38:29.623]  And of course, I want universal background checks, that's registration.
[00:38:30.143 --> 00:38:34.505]  When you give your wife or husband or 18-year-old son or daughter a gun, or grandpa dies.
[00:38:35.486 --> 00:38:40.528]  So it's ban all semi-autos, register guns, and it goes on from there.
[00:38:40.888 --> 00:38:42.008]  They've already done that everywhere.
[00:38:42.288 --> 00:38:45.730]  They did that in Australia, Canada, you name it.
[00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:47.150]  Very hard to own a gun now.
[00:38:48.371 --> 00:38:49.331]  Banned in most parts of the world.
[00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:51.432]  The same formula, the same steps, they do it.
[00:38:52.858 --> 00:38:54.939]  But we put together a little compilation here.
[00:38:55.199 --> 00:38:57.840]  You know, I told McBrain to make it a minute long, but he couldn't help it.
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:58.681]  It's like three minutes long.
[00:38:58.721 --> 00:39:06.724]  The Japosovets coming on with all the big news and all the assassination attempts and the insanity and the whistleblowers and the five hit teams and the laser attacks.
[00:39:06.744 --> 00:39:09.545]  And it's just getting, it's not getting, it's total bonker land.
[00:39:10.366 --> 00:39:14.267]  Like they say in Ghostbusters, end of the world type of stuff.
[00:39:14.327 --> 00:39:15.308]  Wrath of God.
[00:39:17.129 --> 00:39:18.609]  Dead rising from the grave.
[00:39:18.649 --> 00:39:19.950]  Dogs and cats living together.
[00:39:21.889 --> 00:39:22.589]  It's not funny though.
[00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:26.110]  Here's a short compilation of where she really stands.
[00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:28.751]  I and Tim Walz are both gun owners.
[00:39:29.011 --> 00:39:31.131]  We will not take anybody's guns away.
[00:39:31.671 --> 00:39:35.713]  We also need to have reasonable gun safety laws.
[00:39:36.133 --> 00:39:38.473]  I believe that we need an assault weapons ban.
[00:39:38.713 --> 00:39:40.334]  We need universal background checks.
[00:39:41.054 --> 00:39:42.374]  We need red flag laws.
[00:39:42.514 --> 00:39:43.254]  I'm a gun owner.
[00:39:43.294 --> 00:39:44.095]  Tim Walz is a gun owner.
[00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:44.975]  I did not know that!
[00:39:46.866 --> 00:39:49.086]  If somebody breaks in my house, they're getting shot.
[00:39:49.106 --> 00:39:50.547]  Sorry.
[00:39:50.587 --> 00:39:51.267]  Yes, yes.
[00:39:51.927 --> 00:39:52.447]  I hear that.
[00:39:52.587 --> 00:39:53.087]  I hear that.
[00:39:53.267 --> 00:39:55.448]  Probably should not have said that.
[00:39:55.848 --> 00:39:58.948]  You wanted mandatory government buyback programs for assault weapons.
[00:39:59.008 --> 00:40:00.829]  Now your campaign says you don't.
[00:40:01.389 --> 00:40:02.889]  Tim Walz and I are both gun owners.
[00:40:02.909 --> 00:40:04.550]  We're not taking anybody's guns away.
[00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:06.990]  So stop with the continuous lying about this stuff.
[00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:15.952]  California Senator Kamala Harris says if she becomes president, she will take what her campaign calls executive action to combat gun violence.
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:25.545]  Upon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws.
[00:40:25.605 --> 00:40:29.147]  And if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action.
[00:40:29.648 --> 00:40:40.894]  We, who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence, and that's why we will work to pass universal background checks, red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban.
[00:40:44.342 --> 00:40:49.966]  It is reasonable to say that weapons of war have no place on the streets of America.
[00:40:49.986 --> 00:40:53.548]  And by that, I mean assault weapons.
[00:40:53.588 --> 00:40:56.851]  Weapons of war.
[00:40:57.251 --> 00:41:01.254]  They were literally designed to be weapons of war.
[00:41:01.474 --> 00:41:03.575]  This business about taking everyone's guns away.
[00:41:03.595 --> 00:41:05.677]  Tim Walz and I are both gun owners.
[00:41:05.697 --> 00:41:07.318]  We're not taking anybody's guns away.
[00:41:07.378 --> 00:41:09.720]  So stop with the continuous lying about this stuff.
[00:41:10.777 --> 00:41:15.542]  I believe in the Second Amendment, but I also believe we need to renew the assault weapons ban.
[00:41:15.862 --> 00:41:18.584]  I'm also in favor of the assault weapons ban.
[00:41:18.805 --> 00:41:26.672]  Look, we have 5 million assault weapons on the streets of America, and we have 5 million assault weapons on the streets of America.
[00:41:27.733 --> 00:41:29.274]  And assault weapons have been designed
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.701]  An assault weapon is designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly.
[00:41:35.641 --> 00:41:40.022]  They are weapons of war, and there is no place for them on a civil society.
[00:41:40.063 --> 00:41:43.863]  There is no reason why we have assault weapons on the streets of a civil society.
[00:41:43.904 --> 00:41:44.924]  They are weapons of war.
[00:41:45.204 --> 00:41:47.564]  They are designed to kill a lot of people quickly.
[00:41:47.705 --> 00:41:56.627]  An assault weapon is designed to kill a lot of human beings
[00:41:57.742 --> 00:41:58.162]  Quickly!
[00:41:58.722 --> 00:42:01.523]  We don't have any, we have to get these guns off the street.
[00:42:02.343 --> 00:42:13.465]  But I also, you know, I have faith in the American people to know that, you know, that we want to comply with our laws and that I know that to be true.
[00:42:13.725 --> 00:42:19.327]  We want to ban assault weapons and they want to ban books.
[00:42:19.987 --> 00:42:25.988]  And Congress needs to have the courage to act and renew the assault weapons ban.
[00:42:27.845 --> 00:42:29.326]  We need an assault weapons ban.
[00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:31.386]  These are reasonable things to do.
[00:42:33.667 --> 00:42:40.849]  There is no reason that we have weapons of war on the streets of America.
[00:42:41.169 --> 00:42:44.811]  We need reasonable gun safety laws.
[00:42:44.871 --> 00:42:49.692]  It's something I'm so passionate about and so looking forward to being president to address.
[00:42:49.972 --> 00:42:51.233]  We've got to deal with this.
[00:42:51.333 --> 00:42:53.714]  How mandatory is your gun buyback program?
[00:42:54.094 --> 00:42:54.734]  It's mandatory.
[00:43:00.615 --> 00:43:10.738]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Jack Posobiec is with us, investigative journalist, former Naval Intelligence, and some of the best sources out there as private investigators on the ground investigating both the attempted assassinations of President Trump.
[00:43:11.178 --> 00:43:16.039]  He'll be doing a big briefing with myself and Tucker Carlson in Reading, Pennsylvania on Monday.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.920]  It looks like it is going to sell out, but tickets are still available.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.122]  Hope you find all of that at tuckercarlson.com forward slash events.
[00:43:23.342 --> 00:43:27.343]  Okay, Jack, so much here, limited time.
[00:43:28.433 --> 00:43:29.354]  Totally insane.
[00:43:29.535 --> 00:43:35.944]  Rasmussen pulls the most accurate we know, showing she's crumbling in all the major swing states, particularly Georgia and Pennsylvania.
[00:43:36.264 --> 00:43:39.328]  Head of Rasmussen joins us next hour, their head pollster.
[00:43:39.809 --> 00:43:43.674]  We have Matt Gates, think DHS told him five hit teams, three foreign, two domestic.
[00:43:44.215 --> 00:43:47.157]  That looks to me like cover for when they try to kill Trump to blame it on Iran or something.
[00:43:47.877 --> 00:43:57.864]  We have Senator Josh Hawley with Secret Service whistleblowers saying that they stood down last Sunday, six days ago, there outside Mar-a-Lago at the Palm Beach golf club that Trump owns.
[00:43:58.564 --> 00:44:05.789]  We have now more evidence mounting that some type of infrared laser was used a week and a half ago, two Sundays ago, almost two weeks ago in
[00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.211]  Arizona, they're in Tucson.
[00:44:09.671 --> 00:44:14.655]  This is just insane that all of this is going on and unfolding.
[00:44:15.675 --> 00:44:18.897]  Jack, the country is in a fight for its life right now with 45 days to the election.
[00:44:19.738 --> 00:44:21.879]  Let's get into the DHS information.
[00:44:21.899 --> 00:44:23.380]  Give it to Congressman Matt Gaetz first.
[00:44:24.036 --> 00:44:24.577]  That's right, Alex.
[00:44:24.617 --> 00:44:25.918]  Thanks so much for having me on.
[00:44:25.938 --> 00:44:28.481]  So, Charlie Kirk and myself, we're at Penn State University.
[00:44:28.501 --> 00:44:31.844]  We were conducting a Get Out the Vote event yesterday there.
[00:44:32.284 --> 00:44:32.705]  3,000 students.
[00:44:32.725 --> 00:44:34.066]  We brought 1,500 hats.
[00:44:34.106 --> 00:44:36.309]  We had doubled the amount of students co-op.
[00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:37.830]  We didn't even have enough hats there.
[00:44:38.331 --> 00:44:47.280]  And then Matt Gaetz came on my program and he just dropped this absolute bombshell that he had a source, he said, came into his office
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.802]  And I've talked with Matt off air as well.
[00:44:49.822 --> 00:44:54.386]  We're going to see if this person is interested in filing a whistleblower report or not.
[00:44:54.726 --> 00:45:00.791]  That being said, what he told Matt, again, five assassination teams and that, by the way, this is key.
[00:45:01.192 --> 00:45:05.355]  These five teams and supposedly now this is the information that was given.
[00:45:05.675 --> 00:45:11.760]  So we also have to assess whether or not this information was given to Gates as a
[00:45:12.568 --> 00:45:12.788]  I don't
[00:45:36.457 --> 00:45:42.004]  Expecting that the assassination attempt would be successful, but it was not.
[00:45:42.124 --> 00:45:43.085]  And that was so obvious.
[00:45:43.185 --> 00:45:45.007]  I called it three days before they did that.
[00:45:45.208 --> 00:45:47.811]  That's how obvious it was.
[00:45:48.071 --> 00:45:54.659]  The question is then, are we dealing with a situation where there are multiple cover stories that people trying to put out?
[00:45:54.919 --> 00:45:56.401]  Are there multiple situations?
[00:45:56.721 --> 00:46:00.222]  Where you have cover stories that are being planted with media.
[00:46:00.462 --> 00:46:04.564]  You've got shooters that are taking pot shots at Trump, it seems, almost left and right.
[00:46:04.584 --> 00:46:11.046]  You've got rallies where people are experiencing these chemical-related symptoms, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:46:11.066 --> 00:46:12.607]  It sounds to me like CS.
[00:46:12.887 --> 00:46:16.368]  I actually have a source from Secret Service on that.
[00:46:17.049 --> 00:46:25.992]  And what we're hearing, though, as well, and again, it came out on Human Events yesterday, regarding these five teams, was that this, and this is key, by the way, Alex.
[00:46:26.564 --> 00:46:34.108]  What the source said was that this information was known to the Department of Homeland Security prior to the Butler shooting.
[00:46:34.409 --> 00:46:37.911]  So just understand, the information, here's the timeline on this.
[00:46:38.511 --> 00:46:47.216]  The source goes to Gates's office prior to the Trump International Golf Club incident.
[00:46:47.436 --> 00:46:50.898]  So prior to 9-15, Gates has told this just
[00:46:51.889 --> 00:47:01.974]  Recently, right before basically it happens on that afternoon last Sunday, but supposedly DHS had information of a threat report that was coming down from their channels.
[00:47:02.254 --> 00:47:07.216]  We don't know, but what it seems to me is that this information was coming from what?
[00:47:07.816 --> 00:47:09.997]  Another intelligence agency.
[00:47:10.298 --> 00:47:12.038]  So this is what happens in the IC.
[00:47:12.258 --> 00:47:15.440]  One agency generates a report and then they disseminate that report
[00:47:15.811 --> 00:47:16.732]  Through their partners.
[00:47:17.192 --> 00:47:24.056]  So you're looking at DHS got the report obviously Secret Service would have had to have this report as well because they're under DHS.
[00:47:24.317 --> 00:47:30.821]  So then the question is who originated this report because DHS isn't going overseas and running all this stuff.
[00:47:30.861 --> 00:47:39.586]  No, we know that domestic intelligence and domestic threats are supposed to are the purview of the FBI and international is under CIA.
[00:47:39.626 --> 00:47:41.928]  So the tip off here Alex the tip off.
[00:47:42.236 --> 00:47:57.103]  To say that there's three assassination teams that are foreign, that means that that report more than likely, more than likely was associated with the Central Intelligence Agency, which has the primary responsibility of focusing on foreign threats.
[00:47:57.343 --> 00:47:58.103]  So you get what I'm saying?
[00:47:58.464 --> 00:48:03.426]  This information likely came from FBI, CIA, was filtered down to DHS.
[00:48:03.706 --> 00:48:05.867]  Someone says, wait a minute, this doesn't make any sense.
[00:48:06.047 --> 00:48:08.929]  They go to Gates to blow the whistle to say something's going on.
[00:48:09.229 --> 00:48:12.030]  But the question, of course, is where did the story get started?
[00:48:12.489 --> 00:48:12.589]  And
[00:48:29.855 --> 00:48:33.777]  For our book, Bulletproof, The Truth About the Trump Assassination Attempts.
[00:48:33.817 --> 00:48:43.502]  And then, of course, you and I will be delivering a more formal briefing on Monday evening, Reading, Pennsylvania, with Tucker Carlson, right up there in PA.
[00:48:43.582 --> 00:48:48.084]  Because there's so much information that's coming out, it's really raw at this point.
[00:48:48.144 --> 00:48:57.089]  And of course, as it develops, we are working with our sources and working with our independent investigators to try to put this all together to make the picture make sense.
[00:48:57.651 --> 00:49:05.514]  Now, let's be very clear and say it again and then move into Senator Josh Hawley's bombshell with the new Secret Service whistleblower that's worked at Mar-a-Lago and is saying they always patrol that.
[00:49:05.795 --> 00:49:07.735]  They always have people there, even with less folks.
[00:49:07.755 --> 00:49:11.077]  This was a stand-down from the default that's been going on for many years.
[00:49:11.157 --> 00:49:14.879]  Obviously, he was actively the president for four years there as well.
[00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:18.320]  We know that Ryan Routh is connected to the CIA.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:25.923]  We know that's who runs these foreign brigades and groups for the Foreign Legion from the U.S.
[00:49:25.943 --> 00:49:26.784]  and other countries there.
[00:49:27.744 --> 00:49:35.552]  And we've been clearly saying looks like they'll probably try to use some cutouts out of that area of the world.
[00:49:36.093 --> 00:49:43.360]  That's just standard procedure, just like they used Operation Mongoose trying to kill Castro to then kill Kennedy here domestically.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.761]  But that's when I saw this break yesterday and saw you guys break it.
[00:49:46.781 --> 00:49:54.662]  I instantly thought the same thing you're saying is they're trying to get ahead of this because they know it's going to go to foreign connections, but it's not foreign governments.
[00:49:55.042 --> 00:50:01.423]  It's the CIA classically working outside the nation or other intelligence groups or corporate mercenary groups to then come back.
[00:50:01.803 --> 00:50:05.464]  And so they may be going to frame Russia or Iran or somebody else.
[00:50:05.724 --> 00:50:08.744]  And it looks like they're going to then, if they're doing that, try another attack.
[00:50:08.984 --> 00:50:11.625]  And they're already pre-programming it that it's a foreign group when they do it.
[00:50:12.105 --> 00:50:16.728]  Even though they tried to blame Iran previously, but how did Iran have the Secret Service stand down?
[00:50:17.068 --> 00:50:29.697]  These foreign governments don't have the motive, but you also have Iran behind the scenes, caught working, hacking- Well, Alex, and Alex, but here's one of the twists here, because we're told Iran, we're told Pakistan, but wait a minute, Ukraine was one of the countries that was mentioned.
[00:50:29.797 --> 00:50:38.403]  So wait a minute, if Ukraine is one of the countries that's mentioned, which of course is the country that's blamed for the Nord Stream 2 strike, when we all know who was really behind that,
[00:50:38.823 --> 00:50:39.444]  We're almost out of time.
[00:50:39.464 --> 00:50:40.445]  What about Senator Hawley?
[00:50:57.242 --> 00:50:58.723]  And look, Senator Howley, of course.
[00:50:58.803 --> 00:51:00.744]  Senator Howley has the information.
[00:51:00.764 --> 00:51:02.205]  We're going to be working with his office.
[00:51:02.425 --> 00:51:04.066]  We're working with Senator Johnson's office.
[00:51:04.086 --> 00:51:05.346]  We're working with Gates's office.
[00:51:05.526 --> 00:51:06.867]  We're putting it all together, Alex.
[00:51:07.027 --> 00:51:14.031]  By Monday, we are going to have the biggest and most in-depth briefing that anyone has given yet on the Trump assassination attempts.
[00:51:14.851 --> 00:51:18.733]  And it's going to go out to tens of millions of Tucker supporters, because after the event, Tucker will put it out.
[00:51:19.174 --> 00:51:19.854]  It is so huge.
[00:51:19.874 --> 00:51:21.315]  I don't even got to do your own show coming up.
[00:51:22.075 --> 00:51:22.595]  60 seconds left.
[00:51:23.056 --> 00:51:23.556]  Other intel.
[00:51:24.881 --> 00:51:34.412]  Look, the biggest other intel I've been told is that the Secret Service knows about biochemical threats to Trump rallies, and they've been putting out biochemical scanners next to the magnetometers.
[00:51:34.452 --> 00:51:35.994]  They look like a little black box.
[00:51:36.315 --> 00:51:37.937]  They look like something that sits on the ground.
[00:51:38.177 --> 00:51:43.944]  But this is something the Secret Service did actively know about even prior to the Tucson rally.
[00:51:44.204 --> 00:51:59.065]  So something is going on where they know that there are people who are experiencing these chemical related symptoms and now this situation where you've got a group of people that were together experiencing the same symptoms is something that actually the Secret Service has been tracking and is looking for in their threat picture.
[00:51:59.265 --> 00:51:59.986]  What about lasers?
[00:52:01.933 --> 00:52:07.978]  Lasers could be something else, because again, you know, this guy was able to get a rangefinder right up to a Trump rally in Butler, so who knows?
[00:52:08.018 --> 00:52:12.342]  It doesn't look like the Secret Service has been letting in many different devices.
[00:52:12.942 --> 00:52:20.749]  But a handheld laser can burn somebody's eyes out in a matter of 30 seconds, and you can't see infrared lasers.
[00:52:21.009 --> 00:52:22.770]  Jack Moselbeck, thank you so much for the time.
[00:52:23.091 --> 00:52:25.453]  Talk to you soon, and I will see you in Reading, my friend.
[00:52:25.913 --> 00:52:26.594]  See you on Monday, Alex.
[00:52:27.214 --> 00:52:28.975]  All right, Rasmussen-Polster coming up.
[00:52:29.776 --> 00:52:31.578]  Mike Adams coming up on the lasers.
[00:52:31.638 --> 00:52:32.139]  Stay with us.
[00:52:32.379 --> 00:52:32.879]  Second hour.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.222]  Today's conspiracy theories.
[00:52:35.582 --> 00:52:36.683]  Tomorrow's truths.
[00:52:36.703 --> 00:52:41.629]  Some of these conspiracy theories have turned out to be true.
[00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:43.450]  Which ones?
[00:52:44.127 --> 00:53:12.514]  The Trump-Russia witch hunt, Jeffrey Epstein, JFK assassination, the misuse of the Patriot Act, the Iraq War, the weapons of mass destruction, the war in Ukraine, the bombing of the Nord Stream Pipeline, the open border migration caravans, the climate change scam, Kim Trails, and HARP, and 9-11 being an inside job, and the Internet of Things surveillance grid, and PFAs, and chemicals in the water turning everyone gay, and the 2020 election being stolen, and January 6 being filled with undercover feds, and Bilderberg, and Bohemian Grove, and global government, not to mention gain-of-function research, and the threat of China,
[00:53:12.774 --> 00:53:14.715]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[00:53:38.371 --> 00:53:42.196]  But it's an adventure to wear any of these shirts, but particularly this one.
[00:53:42.737 --> 00:53:46.722]  Get this design and so many others, they're limited edition, at thealexjonesstore.com.

[00:53:56.413 --> 00:53:57.793]  I love fighting the globalists.
[00:53:58.194 --> 00:53:58.934]  This is what I do.
[00:53:58.974 --> 00:54:00.955]  We've had such a huge effect together.
[00:54:01.395 --> 00:54:14.362]  So I want to thank you all for your past support and encourage you now to go to thealexshowstore.com and be sure to enter for the free truck and $10,000 and buy more product, support the broadcast, and get entered five or ten times, depending on the day, each time you buy a product.

[00:54:22.946 --> 00:54:25.387]  And almost forgot, most of these shirts come in multiple colors.
[00:54:29.228 --> 00:54:34.111]  All right, coming up in about five minutes, the head of Rasmussen polling with devastating news for Kamala.
[00:54:34.931 --> 00:54:40.613]  The Battleground States is coming up on this live Friday, September 20th, 2024 transmission.
[00:54:42.574 --> 00:54:43.655]  Now, I'm about to cover
[00:54:44.665 --> 00:54:46.546]  Sorry, my earpiece just popped off my neck here.
[00:54:47.086 --> 00:54:47.506]  Fix that.
[00:54:47.526 --> 00:54:55.270]  About to cover something absolutely critical to everyone, not just this operation.
[00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:58.651]  I want you to listen to me very, very carefully, please.
[00:54:59.452 --> 00:54:59.692]  All right?
[00:55:03.273 --> 00:55:06.815]  Ladies and gentlemen, 11 weeks ago,
[00:55:08.578 --> 00:55:09.118]  The U.S.
[00:55:09.158 --> 00:55:20.863]  Justice Department trustee assigned to my case, personal and business bankruptcy, ordered without a court order or any reason, the doors of this facility shut.
[00:55:20.903 --> 00:55:24.305]  They lied and said it would just be for three days and they admitted the security.
[00:55:24.325 --> 00:55:26.225]  It would be for a month or permanently.
[00:55:27.186 --> 00:55:32.328]  The judge in Houston, Judge Lopez, had nothing to do with it.
[00:55:34.036 --> 00:55:35.577]  Then it hit the news they were going to close us.
[00:55:36.177 --> 00:55:42.621]  No judge's order, no nothing, just the Justice Department, who'd been involved in the case harassing me from the beginning for over a year and a half.
[00:55:43.821 --> 00:55:44.822]  People were blown away by it.
[00:55:45.082 --> 00:55:46.242]  I refused to go along with it.
[00:55:46.262 --> 00:55:47.403]  I said I'd call the police on them.
[00:55:47.763 --> 00:55:48.524]  They didn't have any orders.
[00:55:49.639 --> 00:55:50.179]  They backed down.
[00:55:50.199 --> 00:55:52.621]  Then they went to court two weeks later and said, we want him removed.
[00:55:53.022 --> 00:55:54.803]  The judge listened to him and said, you're all fired.
[00:55:55.484 --> 00:56:01.969]  The CRO, who had been appointed by the court, and the Justice Department appointed person that the court had let into it.
[00:56:02.089 --> 00:56:04.270]  And they had a Justice Department committee, all this stuff.
[00:56:05.892 --> 00:56:07.773]  Now, I'm in personal bankruptcy.
[00:56:07.873 --> 00:56:16.660]  I agreed to sell the assets of Free Speech Systems, the website, the shopping cart, the equipment, and there was going to be an auction on the 24th of October.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:17.341]  Then they moved to the 30th.
[00:56:20.162 --> 00:56:24.204]  The Democratic Party running all this, the FBI, CIA, it's all come out in the news.
[00:56:24.804 --> 00:56:25.464]  Didn't want that.
[00:56:25.484 --> 00:56:29.246]  They want me off the air by early November.
[00:56:29.646 --> 00:56:30.607]  This is in the court filings.
[00:56:30.627 --> 00:56:31.407]  They said, we don't want money.
[00:56:31.447 --> 00:56:32.027]  Want him shut down.
[00:56:33.868 --> 00:56:35.789]  And the judge said, no, it's going to, it's going to sell.
[00:56:35.889 --> 00:56:38.030]  There's buyers out there that are patriots that I'd work with.
[00:56:39.391 --> 00:56:40.291]  They'd have to outbid that.
[00:56:40.391 --> 00:56:41.232]  They don't want to do that.
[00:56:43.052 --> 00:56:46.394]  So they announced, and I knew this two days ago, it hadn't announced it yet.
[00:56:46.434 --> 00:56:47.655]  It hit Bloomberg, AP Reuters.
[00:56:47.675 --> 00:56:48.455]  We'll put Bloomberg up.
[00:56:50.981 --> 00:56:53.202]  That the Justice Department is intervening.
[00:56:53.322 --> 00:56:56.682]  Alex Jones bankruptcy trustee sale efforts challenged by DOJ.
[00:56:58.043 --> 00:57:01.604]  They rarely get involved in bankruptcies, but they got involved in mine.
[00:57:02.904 --> 00:57:06.925]  They're unable through just pure vigilantism to shut us down 11-12 weeks ago.
[00:57:07.805 --> 00:57:09.566]  Got egg on their face and now they've come back.
[00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:15.067]  They want us shut down and just closed and don't even let them sell the assets.
[00:57:17.199 --> 00:57:17.759]  You heard that.
[00:57:18.159 --> 00:57:19.480]  So it's a gamble, but we were doing it.
[00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:20.900]  Only move we had left.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:26.001]  And they obviously got our phones tapping stuff and know some better is coming.
[00:57:26.261 --> 00:57:27.681]  They're going to have an issue on their hands.
[00:57:29.122 --> 00:57:30.722]  And they don't want to do that.
[00:57:31.462 --> 00:57:33.003]  They've got big billionaire backers they claim.
[00:57:33.023 --> 00:57:34.163]  They've even told that the court.
[00:57:34.463 --> 00:57:35.123]  We'll see what happens.
[00:57:36.344 --> 00:57:37.224]  But I'm not going to give up.
[00:57:39.544 --> 00:57:42.085]  Alex Jones, bankruptcy trustee, sell efforts challenged by DOJ.
[00:57:43.939 --> 00:57:48.121]  That's because they're getting ready to try to take Trump out, and once he's president-elect, they don't want us on air during that fight.
[00:57:48.282 --> 00:57:49.242]  They don't want us telling the truth.
[00:57:49.322 --> 00:57:51.323]  We're reaching tens of millions, conservatively, a day.
[00:57:51.724 --> 00:57:52.924]  Some days, 50, 60 million now.
[00:57:53.965 --> 00:57:55.186]  I can't do this without funding.
[00:57:55.346 --> 00:57:55.926]  I'm out of money.
[00:57:56.706 --> 00:57:59.448]  They took all my money, and it wasn't a lot during the bankruptcy.
[00:57:59.568 --> 00:58:05.772]  I am literally on empty myself, and I have to pay for the legal challenges of all this in court.
[00:58:06.977 --> 00:58:09.798]  And I have to fight them, and that's an hour-long story right there.
[00:58:09.818 --> 00:58:13.078]  They're trying to take my physical name and say they own it, trying to take my social media.
[00:58:13.278 --> 00:58:14.539]  This is a critical fight.
[00:58:14.979 --> 00:58:24.101]  So I need you to go to thealexjonestore.com, that's separate from Free Speech, but there are advertisers here, big supporters, and get Alex Jones t-shirts, Patriot t-shirts.
[00:58:24.121 --> 00:58:25.061]  There's new great designs.
[00:58:25.081 --> 00:58:26.222]  We'll put some on screen for you.
[00:58:28.662 --> 00:58:32.983]  And go to thealexjonestore.com and get the ball caps, the t-shirts, all of it.
[00:58:33.363 --> 00:58:35.864]  You can get Enter to Win for the big pickup truck at $2,000 cash and all that.
[00:58:37.947 --> 00:58:43.650]  And then, contest is over on the 30th of October, strangely enough.
[00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:45.011]  We need the funds.
[00:58:45.051 --> 00:58:46.012]  These are great t-shirts.
[00:58:46.112 --> 00:58:46.832]  I need your aid.
[00:58:46.952 --> 00:58:51.875]  Go to thealexjonestore.com right now and support that sponsor.
[00:58:51.895 --> 00:58:53.236]  That's the critical place to support.
[00:58:53.496 --> 00:58:55.257]  Thealexjonestore.com.
[00:58:55.317 --> 00:58:57.659]  Stand with us and support our outside sponsor.
[00:58:58.439 --> 00:59:02.501]  DrJonesNaturals.com and the InfoWars store, the products are ready to ship, you'll get them.
[00:59:03.001 --> 00:59:10.544]  InfoWarsStore.com, the InfoWars MD, the gummies, the CBD tincture, the nitric boost, it's all there at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:10.584 --> 00:59:11.084]  Now go now.
[00:59:11.384 --> 00:59:21.248]  They wouldn't be trying to kill President Trump and having the Secret Service stand down, Senator Hallie S. Whistleblowers from Mar-a-Lago in the Secret Service, if they didn't think Trump was going to win.
[00:59:22.352 --> 00:59:24.734]  He won by a large margin, all the numbers show.
[00:59:25.155 --> 00:59:27.277]  There was still a lot of fraud, but we overtook it.
[00:59:27.597 --> 00:59:30.740]  The wave was big enough to get over their seawall of fraud in 2016.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:32.141]  He did not have as big a win.
[00:59:33.322 --> 00:59:34.423]  In 2020, they were able to steal it.
[00:59:35.724 --> 00:59:43.772]  Our win was so big in the midterms, they mitigated the big win, so it wasn't a landslide, but we still won back the House and a little bit of the Senate.
[00:59:45.693 --> 00:59:48.156]  Now the numbers I see on the ground from people everywhere
[00:59:50.057 --> 00:59:56.300]  And the issue polls show this as well, show a bigger win for Trump, bigger turnout than 2016.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:58.661]  Now, I'm not a pollster.
[00:59:58.761 --> 01:00:00.421]  I just study the news and talk to the people.
[01:00:02.002 --> 01:00:06.504]  But I've been on air 30 years and Rasmussen is the top polling agency.
[01:00:07.825 --> 01:00:10.886]  Most of the time it's in the top two or three, but I think they've been the most accurate.
[01:00:12.598 --> 01:00:15.721]  And Mark Mitchell is their head of polling and their vice president.
[01:00:16.262 --> 01:00:24.490]  He has a long history and background and experience in operations, finance, venture capital, private equity, the strong foundation in mechanical engineering.
[01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:27.393]  Mark has held leadership positions in various notable companies such as
[01:00:27.913 --> 01:00:30.677]  Walmart, eCommerce, Jet.com, and JPMorgan Chase.
[01:00:31.138 --> 01:00:38.007]  Rasmussen Reports is a nonpartisan independent electronic data company specializing in the collection and publication of public opinion polling information.
[01:00:38.387 --> 01:00:42.313]  Mark underscore R underscore Mitchell or RasmussenReports.com.
[01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:44.928]  He's a very busy man.
[01:00:44.948 --> 01:00:54.056]  He's very gracious to join us with the new data he's getting on the swing states and post-debate and all of it, what he's seeing.
[01:00:54.096 --> 01:01:03.565]  And from what I've seen from the polls, looking at it myself, but he's the expert, he can correct me if I'm reading him wrong, this does not spell good news for Kamala, 45 days out.
[01:01:04.145 --> 01:01:06.668]  So, Mark, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:09.271]  Really happy to be here.
[01:01:09.511 --> 01:01:10.191]  I love your show.
[01:01:10.431 --> 01:01:14.694]  The name is perfect because I think we are in peak info war.
[01:01:15.175 --> 01:01:18.437]  And really, just in the last couple of years, it seems like the tide is turning.
[01:01:18.937 --> 01:01:23.020]  Really, I think nobody, the country can't thank Elon Musk enough.
[01:01:23.601 --> 01:01:30.866]  Because that town square two, three, four years ago, they would just kick you off if the narrative was going the wrong direction.
[01:01:31.246 --> 01:01:32.687]  Look at the NPC memes.
[01:01:33.088 --> 01:01:34.409]  That was really dangerous to them.
[01:01:34.529 --> 01:01:36.991]  And the government forced Twitter to shut it down.
[01:01:37.591 --> 01:01:46.177]  And now I really do think like the cat memes is a really good benchmark of how things have changed in a way that all the spinmeisters have no control over.
[01:01:46.197 --> 01:01:48.799]  And I think that's affecting presidential race as well.
[01:01:49.654 --> 01:01:52.197]  I want to get your take on the subject I'm about to raise.
[01:01:52.217 --> 01:01:54.860]  You can go to this first or go to the huge poll data that you've got.
[01:01:55.686 --> 01:02:02.251]  But we've got Newsom passing a law that's on its face, unconstitutional, that if they decide it's deceptive, you go to jail.
[01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:05.333]  Literally calling it AI, but it's just memes.
[01:02:05.373 --> 01:02:10.517]  And the ones he uses as examples that Elon reposted are obviously a joke and are satire.
[01:02:11.357 --> 01:02:14.520]  And then he said in a press conference yesterday, yeah, they're looking at targeting Elon.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.822]  You've got Brazil, the EU, Australia coming after Elon.
[01:02:17.842 --> 01:02:19.603]  I mean, this is just naked
[01:02:20.504 --> 01:02:21.044]  We're good to go.
[01:02:44.668 --> 01:02:45.388]  No, that's great.
[01:02:45.448 --> 01:02:46.889]  And I have numbers to back it up.
[01:02:47.049 --> 01:02:53.970]  I think everybody should be absolutely 100% suspicious about this paradox of public opinion.
[01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:55.971]  Listen, her polls are not good.
[01:02:56.571 --> 01:03:01.432]  Everybody has talked about the leaked internal polling and how they don't match the public polling.
[01:03:01.732 --> 01:03:03.313]  Our numbers show Trump plus two.
[01:03:03.393 --> 01:03:06.133]  That was the big poll we put out just yesterday.
[01:03:06.353 --> 01:03:08.294]  The race is kind of rock steady.
[01:03:08.654 --> 01:03:12.135]  And listen, even if we're one point or two points to the right,
[01:03:12.695 --> 01:03:15.477]  It's still unwinnable for Kamala Harris.
[01:03:15.858 --> 01:03:19.721]  But here's the thing, if she wants to win, she has to win independence.
[01:03:19.841 --> 01:03:30.309]  And the debate, let me tell you, in general voters think that she won, but it didn't move the numbers at all because I think they know who Biden and Kamala Harris are versus Trump and they've made up
[01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:32.130]  We're good to go.
[01:03:49.131 --> 01:03:51.293]  And these numbers, like, weren't even last week.
[01:03:51.333 --> 01:03:54.054]  They were, like, a month after the events.
[01:03:54.495 --> 01:04:03.061]  And independents, only 37% of independents back in 2020, even then, believed that Trump was talking about fine people, you know, who were Nazis.
[01:04:03.581 --> 01:04:08.324]  And only 34% of independents a month after the bloodbath, folks, believed it, too.
[01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:14.889]  So she goes on and she talks about those things in a way that very clearly is not reaching out to independents.
[01:04:15.609 --> 01:04:22.234]  I think everything everybody has seen is that debate had absolutely no impact on how the independents plan to vote.
[01:04:22.934 --> 01:04:24.455]  Why is that?
[01:04:24.475 --> 01:04:28.018]  Why, when you're losing, will you not reach out to new voters?
[01:04:28.058 --> 01:04:43.549]  And I think people should be very suspicious about why the regime, it is a regime, it's got its feelers into the media and all different levels of the government, why they don't seem to want to play into this democratic process.
[01:04:43.609 --> 01:04:44.410]  It's very strange.
[01:04:45.819 --> 01:04:47.339]  I want to get into battleground stages.
[01:04:47.399 --> 01:04:50.460]  I've seen some of your numbers there, and I want to make sure I'm not interpreting those wrong.
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:52.841]  It looks like she's really starting to slip even faster.
[01:04:53.421 --> 01:04:54.121]  Let's get into that.
[01:04:54.181 --> 01:05:00.542]  And then are you going to pull on her going out on Oprah and releasing TV ads as well that, oh, she's a gun enthusiast.
[01:05:00.562 --> 01:05:06.104]  She doesn't want any of your guns, even though in her policy papers, she wants to ban all semi-autos, register all guns.
[01:05:06.164 --> 01:05:07.804]  It's always the prelude to confiscation.
[01:05:08.224 --> 01:05:09.864]  I mean, I'd love to see pulls on that.
[01:05:09.904 --> 01:05:12.305]  I mean, how is that dog hunting?
[01:05:14.766 --> 01:05:17.387]  I think that most people don't think that she's credible.
[01:05:17.448 --> 01:05:21.831]  We did numbers on the border, and quite frankly, I don't think I could pull them up fast enough.
[01:05:22.511 --> 01:05:26.794]  I don't think, directionally, they were so uninteresting they weren't worth remembering.
[01:05:26.834 --> 01:05:30.957]  But people don't believe that she planned on putting any border control in place.
[01:05:31.077 --> 01:05:35.560]  And that's because, as we also asked, they think that she did horrible, as the borders are, 49%.
[01:05:36.901 --> 01:05:41.025]  So people do tie Kamala Harris to the Biden regime.
[01:05:41.425 --> 01:05:52.354]  We had really damning numbers that showed that basically when asked whether she deserves blame for Biden's failures, independents overwhelmingly say yes by a majority.
[01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:59.341]  And whether she deserves credit for Biden's successes, the independents say she doesn't deserve a lot of the credit.
[01:05:59.781 --> 01:06:04.325]  And overwhelmingly, independents by like a 20 point margin think that the Biden campaign
[01:06:05.234 --> 01:06:08.876]  Administration was a failure and not a success.
[01:06:09.116 --> 01:06:14.758]  So listen, the gun, like all the Trump was shot this weekend and it doesn't look like it moved the numbers.
[01:06:15.158 --> 01:06:19.260]  I don't think anything coming out of her mouth is going to either, quite frankly.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:32.286]  And that's why when I released our weekly numbers yesterday, that's why we titled it act of God, because I really do think at this point and not just our numbers where you just put up the pollster accuracy.
[01:06:33.115 --> 01:06:34.256]  That can you put that back up?
[01:06:34.376 --> 01:06:35.277]  That's incredible to me.
[01:06:35.497 --> 01:06:40.421]  But I do think at this point me and some other pollsters agree that she is winning.
[01:06:40.962 --> 01:06:42.503]  He is winning the national popular vote.
[01:06:42.543 --> 01:06:42.903]  There you go.
[01:06:43.223 --> 01:06:45.125]  In a way that he never has before.
[01:06:45.385 --> 01:06:48.628]  And everybody's locked in and there's no way she's going to get it back.
[01:06:49.128 --> 01:06:50.549]  So, you have Trafalgar.
[01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:53.290]  At the top of that was Atlas.
[01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:53.931]  We're there.
[01:06:54.391 --> 01:07:00.895]  All those people at the top, and this is just one way to measure pollster accuracy, but this is 538's 2020 polling accuracy.
[01:07:00.935 --> 01:07:01.955]  We're pretty good.
[01:07:02.015 --> 01:07:03.276]  It was a hard election to poll.
[01:07:03.916 --> 01:07:09.299]  All those people at the top, if you look at their polls right now, they all show the race tied or Trump winning.
[01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:14.202]  But the bottom, all of the people with the bigger polling inaccuracy,
[01:07:14.924 --> 01:07:15.825]  Show Harris winnings.
[01:07:16.225 --> 01:07:18.026]  Like, it's literally that clear.
[01:07:18.066 --> 01:07:25.411]  There's like a break point one third way down the chart, and then everybody that did horribly in 2020 shows Harris winning right now.
[01:07:25.771 --> 01:07:26.412]  That's incredible.
[01:07:26.572 --> 01:07:27.933]  Now listen, you know, a lot could happen.
[01:07:27.953 --> 01:07:34.577]  I think everybody is very, very correct to be concerned about fraud, 100%.
[01:07:35.558 --> 01:07:38.159]  But here's the other thing people have to know about polling, right?
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:43.403]  In my opinion, you're not going to look at our final call and say, wow,
[01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:45.513]  Rasmussen really nailed it.
[01:07:45.593 --> 01:07:55.432]  They got the race correct because I've put out so far seven or eight weeks worth of data of Trump versus Kamala Harris and we're going to all the way up to election day.
[01:07:56.147 --> 01:08:06.853]  The thing that I'm trying to do and that I'm being honest and putting out my numbers correctly is so that you can see all the other scumbag liars in the industry that are trying to create false narratives.
[01:08:07.154 --> 01:08:14.398]  Everybody watching this right now has probably seen headlines in the last month about all this incredible Kamala Harris momentum.
[01:08:14.978 --> 01:08:19.962]  And how she is now, you know, turning things around for the Democrats and is running away with the race.
[01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:26.347]  If you put my daily overnight results up there, you can see, like, there really just hasn't been that much movement.
[01:08:26.927 --> 01:08:28.448]  Trump was beating Biden by five.
[01:08:28.868 --> 01:08:30.470]  She entered the race and narrowed some.
[01:08:30.930 --> 01:08:32.971]  And it looks like a two to three point race right now.
[01:08:32.991 --> 01:08:35.473]  And it looks like she hit a ceiling at 47 percent.
[01:08:36.114 --> 01:08:39.356]  You know, even if we're two points wrong and she hits a ceiling at 48 percent.
[01:08:39.376 --> 01:08:39.496]  Right.
[01:08:41.312 --> 01:08:44.193]  Enough when Trump overperformed in every swing state in 2020.
[01:08:44.613 --> 01:08:47.094]  And you wanted to ask about the swing states yet.
[01:08:48.235 --> 01:08:49.835]  We pulled in the middle of August.
[01:08:49.895 --> 01:08:51.816]  Every single one of them was a statistical tie.
[01:08:52.436 --> 01:08:54.757]  We think we're probably a point or two to left.
[01:08:55.017 --> 01:08:59.779]  But actually I stayed up till one o'clock last night pulling the trigger on our big swing state.
[01:09:00.279 --> 01:09:01.860]  So we will have numbers back next week.
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:02.900]  We just don't have them yet.
[01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:11.112]  I put some really awesome questions in there that I think are going to help people understand really the state of what's going on.
[01:09:11.512 --> 01:09:13.833]  Questions like, who's America's biggest enemy?
[01:09:13.913 --> 01:09:18.015]  Iran, Russia, China, the Democrats or the Republicans?
[01:09:18.675 --> 01:09:20.816]  Are you better off than you were four years ago?
[01:09:21.076 --> 01:09:22.657]  Will your children have a better future?
[01:09:22.777 --> 01:09:23.497]  Even things like,
[01:09:24.017 --> 01:09:29.101]  Which candidate most closely represents your values when it comes to things like gender identity?
[01:09:29.361 --> 01:09:31.662]  So there's like 30, 40 questions.
[01:09:31.682 --> 01:09:34.024]  We're going to get them back on 10 different states.
[01:09:34.184 --> 01:09:35.705]  People have been begging for Virginia.
[01:09:35.725 --> 01:09:39.948]  And I expect to see movement towards Trump.
[01:09:40.088 --> 01:09:47.853]  I expect to see, based on just looking at where my national numbers went, that he's probably now going to be winning four to six of those swing states.
[01:09:48.233 --> 01:09:49.254]  And, you know, that's
[01:09:50.012 --> 01:09:57.295]  Not a narrative that Morning Consult, CNN, MSNBC want to get out right now.
[01:09:57.775 --> 01:09:59.556]  And they really seem to be fighting hard.
[01:09:59.576 --> 01:10:07.279]  It's like some of these guys have like Harris up six in Pennsylvania when they put out polls that were 12 points off in the last two cycles.
[01:10:07.559 --> 01:10:11.060]  The amount of just inaccuracy and lying is incredible.
[01:10:11.983 --> 01:10:17.508]  Well, what I'm mentioning here, and I was looking at the polls, is you were talking about the numbers you're seeing as you can pile these, kind of give us a first look.
[01:10:17.528 --> 01:10:20.931]  You told Benny Johnson yesterday, it's looking really bad for Kamala Harris.
[01:10:20.971 --> 01:10:24.533]  Our new polls in Pennsylvania might even start to change the betting odds.
[01:10:24.834 --> 01:10:27.436]  The narrative will be that Kamala Harris is starting to lose.
[01:10:27.476 --> 01:10:28.597]  Can you elaborate on that statement?
[01:10:29.848 --> 01:10:33.972]  You know, everybody right now is all knee-jerk reaction to this poll.
[01:10:34.032 --> 01:10:40.477]  I think Suffolk dropped one in Pennsylvania, and then I think Nate Cohn at New York Times put one out, too.
[01:10:40.497 --> 01:10:42.218]  I haven't looked at the Real Clear Politics page.
[01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:42.678]  I'll bring it up.
[01:10:43.199 --> 01:10:46.241]  But, you know, they all show Harris wins.
[01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:52.486]  But then what happens is, like, you get things like New York Times shows a tied race right now.
[01:10:52.546 --> 01:10:54.428]  They had Trump plus one, like, two weeks ago.
[01:10:54.748 --> 01:10:56.910]  They showed a tied race nationally.
[01:10:57.511 --> 01:11:03.606]  And then they put out like numbers that show Harris winning by like four or six points in Pennsylvania.
[01:11:03.806 --> 01:11:06.774]  And that just doesn't make sense when you compare how the states
[01:11:07.373 --> 01:11:07.893]  We're good to go.
[01:11:30.963 --> 01:11:41.428]  Um, you know, swing state polls that show things way left and listen, like what's changed in Pennsylvania in the month since we've been in the field and showed that it was a tie.
[01:11:42.408 --> 01:11:45.329]  How about things like the teamsters union endorsement, right?
[01:11:45.749 --> 01:11:51.572]  All of a sudden you got a million blue collar workers that have shifted over the last four years, 20 points towards Trump.
[01:11:52.242 --> 01:11:53.603]  Where do those people live?
[01:11:53.644 --> 01:11:54.544]  Right?
[01:11:54.845 --> 01:11:56.006]  It's not in Alaska.
[01:11:56.446 --> 01:11:58.869]  They live in states like Pennsylvania.
[01:11:59.529 --> 01:12:07.758]  And so you're just seeing this constant pressure in the industry to show leftward movement in the places that matter for Kamala Harris.
[01:12:07.838 --> 01:12:09.880]  And that's why so much focus is on Pennsylvania.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.762]  It's a must-win state for her.
[01:12:12.482 --> 01:12:16.545]  And it's just crazy to figure out what's going on behind the scenes.
[01:12:16.625 --> 01:12:18.646]  Why didn't she pick Shapiro?
[01:12:19.247 --> 01:12:26.372]  What do they think their strategy is if they're really not believably convincing people that they're going to be pro-energy?
[01:12:27.392 --> 01:12:31.255]  We are asking a lot of energy questions in this poll as well.
[01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:33.636]  And that's it, right?
[01:12:33.696 --> 01:12:38.880]  How are you appealing to independents with the same canned stuff and regurgitating the hoaxes?
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:41.762]  People aren't watching CNN and MSNBC anymore.
[01:12:42.361 --> 01:12:44.623]  They're begging for our content, right?
[01:12:44.923 --> 01:12:47.025]  Let me ask you this.
[01:12:47.706 --> 01:12:47.906]  Yeah.
[01:12:48.106 --> 01:12:51.028]  I mean, I've seen Trump and people saying, oh, even New Jersey.
[01:12:51.048 --> 01:12:54.471]  So you've got states that really aren't swing states or any closer swing states.
[01:12:54.952 --> 01:12:59.075]  Is it from what you've seen, is New Jersey really in play?
[01:12:59.295 --> 01:13:05.040]  And what, you know, almost purple states could be swing states from the numbers you're seeing?
[01:13:07.685 --> 01:13:14.928]  Yeah, I'll text you guys the results to our Virginia state that I should have done processing over the weekend.
[01:13:15.168 --> 01:13:16.529]  I didn't go into New Jersey yet.
[01:13:17.069 --> 01:13:20.691]  I don't think it's right to poll in New Jersey necessarily when you haven't
[01:13:21.638 --> 01:13:25.741]  Convinced yourself internally as a pollster where Pennsylvania lies, for instance, right?
[01:13:26.161 --> 01:13:30.003]  There are reasons to think that Pennsylvania has shifted largely right.
[01:13:30.023 --> 01:13:33.025]  You know, Chittorally did pretty well in 22.
[01:13:33.306 --> 01:13:38.949]  But, you know, it's when those late blue precinct returns start to get a little dicey.
[01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:43.132]  But also people weren't really happy with what Murphy did with COVID.
[01:13:44.613 --> 01:13:48.795]  And I will say, like, I've met some of the local I'm in New Jersey.
[01:13:48.855 --> 01:13:51.017]  I've met some of the local Republican Party folks.
[01:13:54.488 --> 01:13:55.948]  I just don't think they're there yet, right?
[01:13:56.028 --> 01:14:05.254]  I don't think there's symmetry yet in the party machines in the state in a way that maybe the polling will show right where we're moving, but I just don't see it going there.
[01:14:05.394 --> 01:14:05.974]  Where's Georgia?
[01:14:06.014 --> 01:14:08.476]  I was watching CNN today with their poll saying it's a dead heat.
[01:14:10.737 --> 01:14:12.018]  What are your numbers on Georgia?
[01:14:14.285 --> 01:14:17.431]  I had Georgia plus five in July against Biden.
[01:14:17.732 --> 01:14:24.944]  We didn't get to pull Georgia in August, but where the other states stacked up, pretty sure it would have been a plus two or plus three.
[01:14:25.996 --> 01:14:31.921]  And because of that, I'm expecting next week to probably see a plus three plus four, but I can always be surprised.
[01:14:32.782 --> 01:14:39.968]  You know, I think it's listen, you know, if Arizona is going Trump plus two to five, Georgia is definitely going to also.
[01:14:40.748 --> 01:14:43.331]  And by extension, we're also going to have North Carolina numbers.
[01:14:44.231 --> 01:14:46.313]  Yeah, really sorry I wasn't able to get all those things.
[01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:46.933]  Oh, you're incredible.
[01:14:46.953 --> 01:14:56.439]  Let me ask you this, just as a citizen and just your general opinion, because it's all just stalled in the day, kind of a dead reckoning when you look at all the numbers, because we're not God.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:03.804]  I see fear in the statements and desperation from the Democrats trying to ban speech, openly saying they want to ban speech.
[01:15:03.844 --> 01:15:08.367]  We're talking Communist China level statements and actions by Newsom.
[01:15:09.008 --> 01:15:11.189]  That to me does not signify confidence.
[01:15:11.529 --> 01:15:12.690]  You got Kamala a few weeks ago
[01:15:16.393 --> 01:15:18.874]  Georgia, they're in Atlanta saying, hey, don't believe the polls.
[01:15:18.915 --> 01:15:19.735]  It's really, really close.
[01:15:19.775 --> 01:15:20.556]  I'm sure you saw that.
[01:15:20.896 --> 01:15:22.177]  What does that look like to you?
[01:15:23.755 --> 01:15:35.058]  I mean, yeah, I think it is desperation, not even from the mouths of the politicians themselves, but the type of discourse that's palpably happening on Twitter now just absolutely blows my mind.
[01:15:35.518 --> 01:15:43.561]  You know, three or four years ago, these are people that in a discussion with you would get super pedantic about all the scientific details about a virus, right?
[01:15:43.921 --> 01:15:49.862]  And about how, you know, vaccine science and all of these organizations, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?
[01:15:50.543 --> 01:15:51.603]  Now, when I put
[01:15:52.304 --> 01:16:00.626]  But like stuff out there like that chart I showed you that shows that the polling error in the polling industry leans Democrat.
[01:16:01.066 --> 01:16:04.286]  And I asked for people to engage in real conversation.
[01:16:04.846 --> 01:16:11.387]  What I get is just a bunch of anti-science, dismissive, unobjective thinking from lefties.
[01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:14.708]  And it must be a horrible place for them to be right now.
[01:16:14.768 --> 01:16:16.268]  But listen, I'm a content creator.
[01:16:16.328 --> 01:16:17.008]  You are too.
[01:16:17.609 --> 01:16:19.749]  You can feel what people want from
[01:16:20.650 --> 01:16:21.351]  Their content.
[01:16:21.551 --> 01:16:26.856]  And do your followers want a comfy warm blanket and to be told everything's okay?
[01:16:26.936 --> 01:16:28.937]  Or do they want objective truths and facts?
[01:16:29.118 --> 01:16:30.799]  That's what my viewers are hungry for.
[01:16:30.819 --> 01:16:37.525]  And listen, I'm not going to lie to you and tell you, put my thumb on the scale for Trump at all.
[01:16:38.185 --> 01:16:42.109]  If I don't have the integrity to put factual data out there, that's what people are craving for.
[01:16:42.429 --> 01:16:45.372]  And right now, I just look at the debate, right?
[01:16:45.392 --> 01:16:45.972]  It's crazy.
[01:16:46.052 --> 01:16:46.673]  Those people
[01:16:47.393 --> 01:16:51.815]  Wanted to see a comfy blanket and I got debate numbers back and they're absolutely insane.
[01:16:52.315 --> 01:16:53.975]  Guess who watched the debate?
[01:16:54.255 --> 01:17:02.638]  And again, these numbers in general show that it was like slightly a Kamala Harris win and most of the Trump supporters didn't even watch the whole debate.
[01:17:03.078 --> 01:17:05.599]  But who watched the debate more than anybody else?
[01:17:06.099 --> 01:17:08.660]  Who said that they watched all of it?
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:09.260]  80% of them.
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.761]  It's Joe Biden's strong approvers.
[01:17:12.481 --> 01:17:14.243]  Those are the people who watched the debate most.
[01:17:14.783 --> 01:17:17.826]  And then we asked, how would you rate the job done by the debate moderators?
[01:17:17.886 --> 01:17:22.129]  Now, anybody with a brain can look at those people and say, you know, it was a three-way debate.
[01:17:22.249 --> 01:17:23.370]  They were getting hostile.
[01:17:23.991 --> 01:17:29.996]  Joe Biden's strong approvers rate the debate moderators 90% excellent or good.
[01:17:31.737 --> 01:17:32.237]  That's nuts.
[01:17:33.689 --> 01:17:34.970]  I mean, it's nuts.
[01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:40.392]  Looking at these numbers, it was like some kind of public humiliation performance event.
[01:17:40.832 --> 01:17:43.814]  It was not an event to convince independents.
[01:17:44.054 --> 01:17:45.815]  It was an event to try
[01:17:46.926 --> 01:17:49.568]  And have a public whipping of Donald Trump.
[01:17:49.608 --> 01:17:50.309]  That's what the debate was.
[01:17:50.349 --> 01:17:54.293]  It was a digital attempt at lynching, but it worked a little bit not as much as they hoped.
[01:17:54.313 --> 01:17:55.013]  I think he still won.
[01:17:55.433 --> 01:18:01.879]  Let me ask you this, since you mentioned that graph showing what pollsters predicted last time versus this time, and that's so powerful.
[01:18:01.899 --> 01:18:04.561]  For people who don't understand this poll, or maybe didn't poll, explain.
[01:18:05.422 --> 01:18:11.609]  You're showing who was accurate last time and what they're saying this time versus who was way off last time and what they're saying this time.
[01:18:11.649 --> 01:18:17.335]  And the worst polling agencies are the most wrong are all the ones saying she's going to win by the biggest margin.
[01:18:17.576 --> 01:18:20.519]  The ones that have a history of being right, like you, are saying the opposite.
[01:18:21.809 --> 01:18:22.289]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:22.349 --> 01:18:27.112]  This is the stack ranked average polling error as calculated by Nate Silver.
[01:18:27.552 --> 01:18:30.913]  And I'm not sure exactly how he does it, but I think it's directionally correct.
[01:18:31.033 --> 01:18:34.195]  We did, I think, pretty well in 2020 considering how hard it was.
[01:18:34.535 --> 01:18:37.997]  What this doesn't show is what direction the average error was.
[01:18:38.077 --> 01:18:43.620]  And believe it or not, everybody might say, well, you're a right-wing pollster and all your results leaned right in 2020.
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:46.561]  And actually on average, I'm pretty sure we're leaning left.
[01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:51.263]  But the point I want to make here is that if you go down to the bottom, it might be cut off.
[01:18:51.443 --> 01:18:53.864]  Look, ABC News Washington Post is down there.
[01:18:54.524 --> 01:18:58.485]  FiveThirtyEight currently rates them as the number two highest best quality pollster.
[01:18:59.145 --> 01:19:02.826]  But just four years ago, their polls were on average seven points off.
[01:19:03.666 --> 01:19:09.967]  That means when Biden got a four percent, they were showing Biden plus 11 nationally.
[01:19:10.427 --> 01:19:11.708]  And then look at Quinnipiac.
[01:19:11.968 --> 01:19:12.508]  Dear Lord.
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:17.229]  Quinnipiac has still been cherry picked by the mainstream media this cycle.
[01:19:17.856 --> 01:19:21.417]  You're the fourth most accurate, but it's easy when you're small polling groups to do a lot less.
[01:19:21.437 --> 01:19:23.477]  You guys are super prolific.
[01:19:23.497 --> 01:19:27.619]  So I bet if you crunch those numbers, you're actually number one, because the more you do,
[01:19:45.404 --> 01:19:49.749]  You know, even if you're Babe Ruth, he plays more games, he's going to have, you know, some also bad days.
[01:19:50.050 --> 01:19:51.612]  So that would probably put you guys at number one.
[01:19:52.597 --> 01:19:53.297]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:53.357 --> 01:19:56.018]  We're putting out more polls than anybody on this list right now.
[01:19:56.038 --> 01:19:58.538]  And to me, that's one of the big stories about public opinion.
[01:19:58.558 --> 01:20:06.200]  I would love to get the right to a place where it believes polling again, because I'm not lying to you, and public opinion is important.
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.560]  Not just the election match-ups.
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:11.141]  Like, I love combating fake narratives, and I hate lying.
[01:20:11.261 --> 01:20:12.841]  That's why we put our election stuff out.
[01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:16.702]  But not a single human being polled on vaccine-averse events.
[01:20:16.922 --> 01:20:21.043]  Like, literally nobody, and not a single news media source, cared about it, period, whatsoever.
[01:20:21.587 --> 01:20:23.308]  Who's holding these people accountable?
[01:20:23.328 --> 01:20:26.789]  Because all of science, the medical industry, the government regulators, nobody cared.
[01:20:27.169 --> 01:20:29.810]  Not the insurance industry, not any independent.
[01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:33.392]  I think there are a few independent journalists that cared about vaccine injuries.
[01:20:33.592 --> 01:20:34.832]  Not a single other person cared.
[01:20:35.353 --> 01:20:43.336]  And so that's why I think the right, who in my opinion right now, are the people consuming objective thoughts, having open dialogue.
[01:20:44.082 --> 01:20:49.808]  of debating things based on their merit, not hiding behind credentials, need to do a heck of a lot more polling.
[01:20:49.828 --> 01:20:56.755]  But what happened, I think, is after 2020, because all of those people beclowned themselves, the entire industry has been destroyed.
[01:20:57.136 --> 01:20:59.498]  And every single one of these pollsters has had their budgets cut.
[01:20:59.618 --> 01:21:00.600]  I think that's what happened.
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:05.485]  Like New York Times has put out like four monthly national matchups, period.
[01:21:06.065 --> 01:21:07.146]  That company is huge.
[01:21:07.206 --> 01:21:10.008]  It's got a billion-dollar, multi-billion-dollar revenue.
[01:21:10.188 --> 01:21:11.949]  Well, you guys are bigger than ever, and you're right.
[01:21:11.989 --> 01:21:13.070]  It's tomorrow's news today.
[01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:14.211]  It's about being accurate.
[01:21:14.231 --> 01:21:15.291]  It's about getting it right.
[01:21:15.311 --> 01:21:16.492]  It's about wanting to get it right.
[01:21:16.532 --> 01:21:19.714]  Mark Mitchell, you guys are doing it, and it's Trump's to lose.
[01:21:19.734 --> 01:21:21.455]  We've all got to be super engaged because of the fraud.
[01:21:21.495 --> 01:21:25.958]  RasmussenReports.com, onX, Mark underscore R underscore Mitchell.
[01:21:26.259 --> 01:21:28.140]  Mark Mitchell, come back and join us again soon.
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:28.720]  You're very busy.
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:29.481]  We really appreciate you.
[01:21:30.635 --> 01:21:31.216]  No, I'd love to.
[01:21:31.276 --> 01:21:32.639]  We'll talk about those swing state results.
[01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:49.277]  Now a lot of you will recognize this bad boy because it was a limited edition bestseller years ago.
[01:21:49.297 --> 01:21:52.899]  We've updated it and brought it back due to your demanding it.
[01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:54.641]  And it is a conservation shirt.
[01:21:54.661 --> 01:21:56.242]  It's a great conversation piece.
[01:21:56.723 --> 01:22:03.188]  Atrazine is literally sterilizing and killing frog populations and bending the gender of our young boys and giving our girls cancer.
[01:22:03.288 --> 01:22:05.029]  So this is a real conservation shirt.
[01:22:05.069 --> 01:22:12.055]  You can serve our operation, keep us on air, and stand up for amphibian life that are being poisoned by the chemicals that are turning the frogs gay.
[01:22:13.838 --> 01:22:17.160]  I love this shirt as well because the left's always acting like they're the mavericks.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:18.501]  They're the trailblazers.
[01:22:18.541 --> 01:22:19.221]  They're the outlaws.
[01:22:19.861 --> 01:22:23.203]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we are the rebels against the globalists.
[01:22:23.703 --> 01:22:24.584]  We are the resistance.
[01:22:25.144 --> 01:22:30.427]  And I'm voting for the outlaw.
[01:22:30.627 --> 01:22:36.190]  Fight the tyrants at point blank range and meet like-minded people and spread the word of the third dimension.
[01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:39.371]  Take action now and don't let the left silence you.
[01:22:39.411 --> 01:22:40.332]  TheAlexJonesStore.com
[01:22:43.832 --> 01:22:45.295]  Alright, we are back.
[01:22:45.515 --> 01:22:48.480]  Mike Adams on the assassination attempts of Trump.
[01:22:49.505 --> 01:22:56.950]  DHS telling Congress that there are five hit teams in the U.S., three foreign, two domestic, a total cover for them getting ready to kill Trump.
[01:22:57.430 --> 01:23:00.452]  Jack Posobiec concurs with that, and his sources inside the government agree.
[01:23:01.173 --> 01:23:02.053]  This is really bad.
[01:23:02.073 --> 01:23:03.374]  It's not like I'm just saying that now.
[01:23:03.895 --> 01:23:08.458]  I said it in the days after they tried to kill Trump and Butler, that they would blame Iran.
[01:23:08.478 --> 01:23:09.438]  Three days later, they did.
[01:23:09.458 --> 01:23:16.423]  And I said, when they start pre-programming that it's foreign hit teams, you know they're about to go with missiles, surface-to-air, truck bombs, drone attacks.
[01:23:18.033 --> 01:23:27.219]  They can just put ammonium nitrate bomb in a building right by where his motorcade's going and blow his ass up that way.
[01:23:27.239 --> 01:23:31.982]  I mean, this is total insane asylum danger.
[01:23:32.322 --> 01:23:40.267]  And then you have Josh Hawley, the senator with the Secret Service whistleblowers, that they stood down in Mar-a-Lago last Sunday as if we already needed them to tell us that.
[01:23:41.107 --> 01:23:43.668]  This is so dangerous.
[01:23:44.148 --> 01:23:45.929]  We are living in such historic time.
[01:23:46.409 --> 01:23:52.031]  I cannot believe that I'm even sitting here calmly talking about all of this on air right now.
[01:23:52.091 --> 01:23:55.332]  I mean, this is just pinch yourself crazy town.
[01:23:56.193 --> 01:23:59.994]  And I feel frustrated or guilty, like I'm not saying enough.
[01:24:00.094 --> 01:24:02.195]  I'm not being hardcore enough.
[01:24:02.235 --> 01:24:07.797]  I mean, what do I need to do to kind of take a big highlighter to what I'm saying and just emblazon it like the sun?
[01:24:09.133 --> 01:24:17.817]  I know you're in the same position as well, but we all have this normalcy bias that there's still checks and balances, we're still in a free country.
[01:24:17.857 --> 01:24:25.060]  They've erased the border, they're child trafficking for physical slavery, slave labor, and sex slavery.
[01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:35.744]  They've already started World War III with the Russians, and they're going to begin raining heavy missiles down on them, and Russia says they'll declare war on us, that that's a declaration of war.
[01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:43.063]  They're taking over all of women's sports with men.
[01:24:44.283 --> 01:24:46.924]  They're arresting people that misgender someone.
[01:24:47.104 --> 01:24:49.565]  They're passing laws to put you in jail for memes.
[01:24:49.605 --> 01:24:52.546]  Hillary's on TV saying, we're gonna put Trump supporters in camps.
[01:24:52.626 --> 01:24:59.128]  And Schmidt of Alphabet and Google says we need the UN to come in and take over America with NATO and silence Americans.
[01:24:59.208 --> 01:25:04.789]  And Hotez and the head of the WHO, Tedros.
[01:25:04.829 --> 01:25:06.830]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:25:07.090 --> 01:25:09.731]  Out in the open, mask is off insanity.
[01:25:11.243 --> 01:25:12.303]  And then total lying.
[01:25:12.404 --> 01:25:13.444]  The Haitians are perfect.
[01:25:13.784 --> 01:25:14.584]  Nothing's happening.
[01:25:16.205 --> 01:25:17.966]  The Venezuelan crime gangs are wonderful.
[01:25:18.006 --> 01:25:18.806]  Nothing's happening.
[01:25:19.406 --> 01:25:20.247]  We don't want your guns.
[01:25:20.267 --> 01:25:21.187]  We're just going to ban them.
[01:25:22.308 --> 01:25:23.548]  Nobody wants to ban fracking.
[01:25:23.568 --> 01:25:26.389]  We just already banned it in many areas and swear we'll ban it all.
[01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:28.770]  There is no inflation.
[01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:29.811]  Ask Kamala last night.
[01:25:29.831 --> 01:25:30.651]  I got the clip coming up.
[01:25:32.412 --> 01:25:33.252]  What do you do about inflation?
[01:25:33.292 --> 01:25:34.753]  She says, I'm going to make things inexpensive.
[01:25:34.793 --> 01:25:35.793]  I'll make the items cheaper.
[01:25:36.334 --> 01:25:38.214]  It's like saying, how are you going to fly?
[01:25:38.234 --> 01:25:39.435]  Well, I'm going to flap my arms.
[01:25:41.403 --> 01:25:44.245]  I'm just, no policy, just, oh, I'm going to make everything cheaper.
[01:25:44.465 --> 01:25:45.365]  How are you going to lower the prices?
[01:25:45.385 --> 01:25:46.206]  I'm just going to make them lower.
[01:25:46.226 --> 01:25:54.651]  It'd be like if I was standing there butt naked in a jail cell with no tools, and somebody walked over and said, Alex, how are you going to make a Swiss watch?
[01:25:54.831 --> 01:25:59.294]  I'm just going to make one right in here with my bed sheets, maybe the toilet water.
[01:26:01.815 --> 01:26:09.140]  No, you've got to have engineers, precision designers, factories that can make very tiny devices, incredible metallurgists.
[01:26:12.108 --> 01:26:13.269]  You gotta have the power supply.
[01:26:13.289 --> 01:26:14.169]  You gotta have it all.
[01:26:14.189 --> 01:26:19.673]  You know, you don't just pull a Swiss watch out of your ass unless you're in the movie Pulp Fiction.
[01:26:21.154 --> 01:26:23.156]  She didn't say, I'm gonna cut energy prices.
[01:26:23.176 --> 01:26:24.597]  I'm gonna have incentives for jobs.
[01:26:25.037 --> 01:26:26.158]  We're gonna cut spending.
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:29.881]  We're gonna increase investment.
[01:26:32.262 --> 01:26:35.024]  We're gonna take the controls off mining and things like that.
[01:26:35.164 --> 01:26:35.465]  No!
[01:26:35.525 --> 01:26:37.006]  She just said, well, I'm gonna make it cheaper.
[01:26:39.141 --> 01:26:45.983]  It's like asking somebody that doesn't know how to swim, how are you going to compete next week in the college state championships for swimming?
[01:26:46.743 --> 01:26:48.223]  You go, I'm just going to go win the race.
[01:26:48.784 --> 01:26:49.724]  Well, tell me how you swim.
[01:26:52.224 --> 01:26:55.065]  Tell me how fast you can do a 200 in the butterfly.
[01:26:55.345 --> 01:26:56.185]  What's a butterfly?
[01:26:57.766 --> 01:26:58.786]  Tell me how to do a flip turn.
[01:26:59.566 --> 01:27:00.027]  What's that?
[01:27:01.567 --> 01:27:02.487]  But they give you a gold medal.
[01:27:03.727 --> 01:27:04.628]  It's insane.
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.102]  How dare you say I want guns?
[01:27:09.302 --> 01:27:11.785]  I just want to ban all the semi-autos and register everybody.
[01:27:13.767 --> 01:27:15.889]  So this is what we've hit.
[01:27:15.949 --> 01:27:19.833]  So I'm going to hit this now a little bit more time to get into all the rest of the news that Mike Adams is coming on.
[01:27:20.194 --> 01:27:21.555]  But I want to just say something to listeners.
[01:27:25.479 --> 01:27:29.464]  Gosh, now it's like almost 12 weeks ago in early June.
[01:27:31.997 --> 01:27:34.557]  I'm here at the office and I see more security people here.
[01:27:34.998 --> 01:27:37.418]  We have uniformed, bonded, armed security.
[01:27:38.318 --> 01:27:39.018]  We normally have two.
[01:27:41.999 --> 01:27:44.259]  And I see more arriving.
[01:27:45.219 --> 01:27:47.740]  And I'm leaving at like 5 o'clock on a Friday.
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:50.580]  And I go, what's going on?
[01:27:52.001 --> 01:27:54.221]  We were just told tonight something might be happening at 9 o'clock.
[01:27:54.701 --> 01:27:56.742]  Just when everybody leaves we gotta... So I call.
[01:28:00.347 --> 01:28:02.888]  Up my bankruptcy lawyer and I go, have you heard about what's going on?
[01:28:03.089 --> 01:28:04.609]  I just learned five minutes ago.
[01:28:05.250 --> 01:28:07.631]  They're going to close the doors at nine o'clock tonight, but they can't.
[01:28:07.651 --> 01:28:08.412]  There's no court order.
[01:28:08.712 --> 01:28:09.152]  Who is?
[01:28:09.612 --> 01:28:10.853]  Well, the CRO and the U.S.
[01:28:10.893 --> 01:28:12.174]  trustee appointed by the Justice Department.
[01:28:12.334 --> 01:28:17.417]  Again, most bankruptcies, maybe one out of a thousand, have the Justice Department decides to come in.
[01:28:18.197 --> 01:28:19.217]  And I don't play victim here.
[01:28:19.237 --> 01:28:34.382]  I mean, I've been in a whole bunch of depositions where there's one or two Justice Department lawyers, and then I've been in Skype meetings with them and Zoom meetings when they're at the Justice Department with a room full of people, and the Justice Department seals behind them, and they read to me the U.S.
[01:28:34.442 --> 01:28:45.045]  Code, and two different code parts, and if I say anything wrong, and basically they read you your rights, and they say, if you say anything wrong, we're going to charge you, you're going to spend 10 years in federal prison.
[01:28:47.932 --> 01:28:57.119]  And I learned when we declared M4's bankruptcy two years ago and my other year and a half ago, the first lawyers quit because they sent him a email from the U.S.
[01:28:57.139 --> 01:28:59.081]  Trustee's Office of the Justice Department in D.C.
[01:29:00.422 --> 01:29:02.603]  saying, this comes from the top.
[01:29:03.224 --> 01:29:08.328]  He got on the phone and they said, the president, from Biden, you will not be afforded the bankruptcy system.
[01:29:08.408 --> 01:29:09.088]  You're not going to do it.
[01:29:09.128 --> 01:29:09.709]  We're shutting you down.
[01:29:11.778 --> 01:29:13.938]  My lawyers in Austin didn't quit, but the ones we got and did.
[01:29:13.958 --> 01:29:16.919]  They're like, we're not messing with the Justice Department.
[01:29:17.139 --> 01:29:19.020]  Are you Lex Luthor or something?
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:25.921]  I mean, imagine, you don't hear about the FBI calling up even John Gotti's lawyers and saying, you're not allowed to represent him.
[01:29:25.961 --> 01:29:27.521]  That's John Gotti, an actual criminal.
[01:29:29.002 --> 01:29:31.482]  They treat me like I am Hitler, okay?
[01:29:32.162 --> 01:29:35.203]  And I literally am a freaking Boy Scout, okay?
[01:29:36.291 --> 01:29:37.192]  And I've been honest about it.
[01:29:37.232 --> 01:29:39.714]  I've drank too much in my life and I like women, but that's it, man.
[01:29:39.794 --> 01:29:41.715]  I don't even speed in my car anymore.
[01:29:42.796 --> 01:29:45.518]  So, I've got outside accountants, top rated, all that stuff.
[01:29:46.579 --> 01:29:47.640]  As I've always known, I was a target.
[01:29:47.660 --> 01:29:49.442]  They had me audited two years ago.
[01:29:49.542 --> 01:29:50.142]  Took them a year.
[01:29:50.162 --> 01:29:51.583]  IRS was up here a whole bunch.
[01:29:51.643 --> 01:29:52.504]  Tore through everything.
[01:29:52.664 --> 01:29:53.405]  Cost all this money.
[01:29:53.745 --> 01:29:54.826]  They said, well, this rarely happens.
[01:29:54.866 --> 01:29:57.008]  Here's $4.3 million back, Mr. Jones.
[01:29:57.328 --> 01:29:58.209]  You overpaid your taxes.
[01:29:59.229 --> 01:30:01.651]  I got a photo of it in my phone.
[01:30:01.671 --> 01:30:02.412]  $4.3 million check.
[01:30:02.692 --> 01:30:04.814]  I was in bankruptcy, went right into the bankruptcy system.
[01:30:06.374 --> 01:30:09.956]  Well, I mean, so yeah, I get tax returns of 4.3 million.
[01:30:09.976 --> 01:30:13.057]  Because the way this is all being run, I'm the sole owner.
[01:30:13.777 --> 01:30:17.579]  The accrual and all that, we overpaid over four years, over a million bucks a year.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:28.284]  Because I tell people just, I know I'm a target, I know this is all BS, just do not even cut any corners, don't even use, you know, just my mission is what matters, not the money.
[01:30:30.162 --> 01:30:34.266]  They also said in court, remember, we know you kept that 9 million in Bitcoin, which I could have, it was going to be personally.
[01:30:34.727 --> 01:30:36.609]  You just lied in here, they said, remember, in Connecticut.
[01:30:37.049 --> 01:30:38.391]  I think the FBI will be interested in that.
[01:30:38.851 --> 01:30:40.693]  Came out in court, everything I said was true on the stand.
[01:30:40.713 --> 01:30:43.016]  You think I'm going to freaking lie to these people, want to put me in prison?
[01:30:43.036 --> 01:30:43.997]  I wouldn't lie anyways.
[01:30:44.998 --> 01:30:45.919]  I ain't got nothing to hide.
[01:30:45.939 --> 01:30:48.242]  So you're going to get the new information now.
[01:30:49.943 --> 01:30:51.065]  All this has gone on.
[01:30:52.492 --> 01:30:53.533]  And people saw all the news.
[01:30:53.593 --> 01:30:55.354]  Infowars is shut down for two weeks.
[01:30:55.434 --> 01:30:57.435]  And then, oh, AP Reuters is typing in.
[01:30:58.195 --> 01:31:04.119]  Sandy Hook Families, he's the FBI, CIA that runs the operation, has come out in court, want to take over Alex Jones' social media.
[01:31:04.139 --> 01:31:05.340]  They're going to close him immediately.
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:08.402]  He's going to close this Thursday, June 14th.
[01:31:09.943 --> 01:31:10.703]  Didn't happen, did it?
[01:31:13.085 --> 01:31:14.605]  Because the judge isn't corrupt.
[01:31:14.625 --> 01:31:16.206]  He's done us no favors, but he's not corrupt.
[01:31:16.246 --> 01:31:16.807]  Point about Trump.
[01:31:17.647 --> 01:31:18.508]  Judge Chris Lopez.
[01:31:19.943 --> 01:31:24.587]  They were dumb enough to come in with a transcript of me criticizing them, trying to close us illegally.
[01:31:24.607 --> 01:31:25.308]  He goes, what's going on?
[01:31:26.810 --> 01:31:28.031]  He goes, I don't want this.
[01:31:28.071 --> 01:31:29.132]  This isn't a real transcript.
[01:31:29.192 --> 01:31:30.793]  It doesn't have the transcript company's name on it.
[01:31:30.813 --> 01:31:32.755]  You've got a real transcript of this, don't you?
[01:31:33.196 --> 01:31:34.637]  They went, actually, sir, we do.
[01:31:35.117 --> 01:31:37.720]  They pull up this huge eight inch stack.
[01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:41.203]  He goes, we're going to take a long lunch for an hour and 45 minutes.
[01:31:42.765 --> 01:31:43.686]  I'm going to read this.
[01:31:45.179 --> 01:31:46.480]  He comes back, he tells the U.S.
[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:47.641]  trustee, you're removed.
[01:31:47.681 --> 01:31:49.041]  He tells the CRO, you're removed.
[01:31:49.061 --> 01:31:50.442]  Mr. Jones has always been the head of this company.
[01:31:50.723 --> 01:31:51.923]  You're not allowed to do what you did.
[01:31:52.304 --> 01:31:55.746]  The last action you were to do is to give him back his company bank accounts.
[01:31:55.926 --> 01:31:57.087]  Do you understand that, Mr. McGill?
[01:31:57.347 --> 01:31:58.648]  McGill goes, I'm the head of the company.
[01:31:59.468 --> 01:32:03.070]  And the judge goes, that's not true, Mr. McGill.
[01:32:05.532 --> 01:32:07.293]  I mean, these guys are backed by the Justice Department.
[01:32:07.553 --> 01:32:09.094]  Mad dogs.
[01:32:09.935 --> 01:32:10.055]  Okay?
[01:32:12.742 --> 01:32:14.242]  They say they own my name.
[01:32:14.743 --> 01:32:15.503]  Totally insane.
[01:32:16.523 --> 01:32:19.304]  That's in New Firelinks too, again, to take all that stuff.
[01:32:19.324 --> 01:32:22.004]  The reason I'm telling you this is, I'll get to the key here in a moment.
[01:32:23.225 --> 01:32:38.189]  So then I got a call two days ago, or I guess three days ago, it was Tuesday, from my lawyer, and she goes, yeah, the Justice Department just filed to block the sale of the assets, the website, the shopping cart, the equipment.
[01:32:39.599 --> 01:32:40.479]  Because they got all our phones tapped.
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:44.621]  And they know, there's patriot buyers, okay?
[01:32:45.821 --> 01:32:57.786]  And they've said we don't want him on air, they've said at the courthouse, the judge department that runs the whole suits and had judges default me and had the HBO script, it was all just scripted, totally fake, on record.
[01:32:58.926 --> 01:33:00.147]  Violated every law you can imagine.
[01:33:00.167 --> 01:33:03.588]  Because this is civil, but what they did is criminal.
[01:33:06.499 --> 01:33:07.620]  Total lawfare, just like Trump.
[01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:08.380]  Total test.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:09.441]  They admitted that on MSNBC.
[01:33:09.501 --> 01:33:10.301]  It's a test for everybody.
[01:33:12.523 --> 01:33:15.644]  They said, we don't want him to stay on air.
[01:33:15.684 --> 01:33:16.425]  We don't want money.
[01:33:16.465 --> 01:33:17.325]  We want it closed.
[01:33:18.906 --> 01:33:21.468]  The judge said, well, I'm not going to do that on the June 14th hearing.
[01:33:21.868 --> 01:33:22.969]  But Mr. Jones is in private.
[01:33:23.806 --> 01:33:26.148]  Bankruptcy too, and he owns free speech systems, so he can liquidate.
[01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:27.950]  And the law's clear you can do that.
[01:33:27.970 --> 01:33:32.475]  There's some law saying you can't sell an LLC, but it's not even in bankruptcy.
[01:33:32.875 --> 01:33:34.377]  I am the sole proprietor.
[01:33:34.517 --> 01:33:35.158]  I'm allowed to.
[01:33:35.878 --> 01:33:42.085]  So, first people saw this yesterday when it broke and said the Justice Department's on your side trying to keep them from selling your company?
[01:33:42.245 --> 01:33:42.645]  No!
[01:33:44.246 --> 01:33:45.326]  Free speech goes away.
[01:33:45.627 --> 01:33:46.767]  They still have debts against me.
[01:33:46.827 --> 01:33:47.727]  I don't care about the money.
[01:33:47.967 --> 01:33:48.648]  There's a new owner.
[01:33:48.728 --> 01:33:49.508]  I can work for them.
[01:33:49.868 --> 01:33:51.729]  Under the law, you can't seize somebody's paycheck.
[01:33:51.889 --> 01:33:52.549]  I stay on air.
[01:33:52.789 --> 01:33:53.689]  Cruz stays employed.
[01:33:54.029 --> 01:33:54.710]  We go on.
[01:33:56.350 --> 01:34:05.654]  So now the Justice Department wants the sale to not be allowed so it can be kicked into Judge Guerra-Gamble's state court.
[01:34:06.054 --> 01:34:08.174]  And she already put an order out three months ago.
[01:34:08.234 --> 01:34:09.375]  The judge blocked federally.
[01:34:10.755 --> 01:34:14.177]  To send in the constables and close the doors then.
[01:34:16.418 --> 01:34:17.798]  We had an emergency hearing.
[01:34:18.779 --> 01:34:25.022]  He took it back into federal court and said that the lawyers that did that probably violated bankruptcy law.
[01:34:27.063 --> 01:34:28.623]  So I'm not making a big deal out of this.
[01:34:28.643 --> 01:34:31.605]  99% of the show we don't talk about me, do we, or this operation.
[01:34:32.045 --> 01:34:33.406]  I have to now because we're at the crossroads.
[01:34:33.446 --> 01:34:34.006]  I can now tell you.
[01:34:36.616 --> 01:34:42.422]  They've tried to have the Justice Department without any warrant, document, shut us down without a piece of toilet paper.
[01:34:42.442 --> 01:34:44.224]  They didn't even give me a piece of toilet paper to wipe their ass with.
[01:34:44.484 --> 01:34:45.225]  Not even a birdcage liner.
[01:34:46.326 --> 01:34:49.689]  Total brazen, vigilante, Yosemite Sam.
[01:34:50.951 --> 01:34:52.432]  I'm the roughest, toughest hombre.
[01:34:52.753 --> 01:34:57.798]  I'm the roughest, toughest hombre east of the Pecos or south of the Rio Grande.
[01:34:58.879 --> 01:34:59.800]  I hates freedom.
[01:35:01.755 --> 01:35:02.736]  So we go through that.
[01:35:03.296 --> 01:35:10.061]  We go through the Travis County that's as blue as Obama's butt or Hillary's butt.
[01:35:10.101 --> 01:35:11.582]  I mean, it's more common than you can imagine.
[01:35:13.663 --> 01:35:14.464]  Try to shut us down.
[01:35:14.484 --> 01:35:15.584]  The judge blocked it there.
[01:35:17.205 --> 01:35:23.029]  And now they've got a hearing Monday while I'm up with Tucker Carlson in Houston where they're going to say, we just want it shut down again.
[01:35:23.049 --> 01:35:24.190]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:35:24.250 --> 01:35:25.071]  It's in God's hands.
[01:35:25.091 --> 01:35:26.031]  It's in the judge's hand.
[01:35:27.773 --> 01:35:27.933]  But
[01:35:29.238 --> 01:35:34.822]  I'm telling you the Justice Department's doing this and what's AP, Reuters, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal, look at the headline right here!
[01:35:34.842 --> 01:35:40.226]  I couldn't believe when this first happened, listeners are like, nobody's trying to shut you without a piece of paper.
[01:35:40.686 --> 01:35:42.167]  There's no warrant, there's no order.
[01:35:42.227 --> 01:35:44.609]  Jones is crying wolf!
[01:35:44.849 --> 01:35:46.811]  You ever heard me cry wolf on purpose?
[01:35:47.171 --> 01:35:50.994]  Have you ever heard me get up here and try to give you a bucket of bullshit?
[01:35:52.116 --> 01:35:52.456]  Damn it.
[01:35:53.497 --> 01:35:57.719]  I want to be just like Rasmussen with a 97% accuracy rate.
[01:35:57.739 --> 01:35:58.360]  That's what they've got.
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:35:59.861]  I've got about that or a little bit higher.
[01:36:00.521 --> 01:36:01.802]  That's what I'm looking for.
[01:36:02.142 --> 01:36:03.022]  That's what I want.
[01:36:03.142 --> 01:36:04.103]  I'm the real McCoy.
[01:36:04.243 --> 01:36:04.863]  I'm genuine.
[01:36:05.064 --> 01:36:10.607]  I'm a real American, real Texan, and I know you're real Americans, real humans as well, and damn it, that's where we are.
[01:36:14.009 --> 01:36:15.169]  So, look at these headlines.
[01:36:15.249 --> 01:36:19.132]  Alex Jones bankruptcy, trustee sale, Everett's challenged by DOJ.
[01:36:19.152 --> 01:36:20.232]  That's the Department of Justice.
[01:36:20.252 --> 01:36:21.253]  Same one's trying to kill Trump.
[01:36:22.841 --> 01:36:24.602]  I'm not talking about these people themselves, but their bosses.
[01:36:25.022 --> 01:36:25.963]  Info wars for sale.
[01:36:26.023 --> 01:36:26.863]  Alex Jones assets.
[01:36:27.604 --> 01:36:29.044]  Again, debated in bankruptcy court.
[01:36:29.084 --> 01:36:29.785]  Wall Street Journal.
[01:36:31.045 --> 01:36:32.186]  This is him back in June.
[01:36:32.326 --> 01:36:35.348]  Alex Jones' personal assets will be sold, but company bankruptcy dismissed.
[01:36:35.408 --> 01:36:35.748]  AP.
[01:36:36.728 --> 01:36:39.070]  Shanigan families want to seize Alex Jones' social media accounts.
[01:36:39.090 --> 01:36:40.650]  Believe me, my personal one, real Alex Jones.
[01:36:42.912 --> 01:36:45.153]  Alex Jones creditors want his social media taken from him.
[01:36:48.535 --> 01:36:48.715]  So.
[01:36:50.489 --> 01:36:51.430]  There it is for you.
[01:36:51.770 --> 01:36:52.671]  This is going on.
[01:36:52.711 --> 01:36:53.932]  It's about getting your rights.
[01:36:53.952 --> 01:36:56.193]  They gotta get through me to get to you, just like Trump says.
[01:36:57.214 --> 01:36:58.175]  Till his mouth bleeds.
[01:36:58.535 --> 01:36:59.415]  Till your ears bleed.
[01:37:00.897 --> 01:37:01.157]  So.
[01:37:08.242 --> 01:37:10.283]  I don't know what's gonna happen at next Monday's hearing.
[01:37:11.004 --> 01:37:11.444]  The 23rd.
[01:37:17.773 --> 01:37:21.254]  We can conceivably, if the judge does what they want, be closed in a week.
[01:37:22.655 --> 01:37:23.755]  Hope we get to come back and say bye.
[01:37:26.076 --> 01:37:33.499]  If you follow past examples of the judge, he does me no favors, but he does not violate the law or let the Justice Department sit on me like an 80,000 pound gorilla.
[01:37:34.739 --> 01:37:36.560]  And he said that in the 14th hearing.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.141]  He went on, you know, he hardly talks.
[01:37:39.281 --> 01:37:41.142]  He went on for like 30 minutes excoriating them.
[01:37:41.162 --> 01:37:44.063]  And he said, you guys have had this guy in bankruptcy for over a year and a half.
[01:37:44.163 --> 01:37:46.164]  You got me to fund off our money.
[01:37:47.671 --> 01:37:57.017]  Three different outside accounting firms to fine-tooth comb over this guy, and you never filed an objection or a suit because he was found to be innocent.
[01:37:57.838 --> 01:38:00.279]  I'm comparing myself to Christ, but it was like Pontius Pilate.
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:01.921]  He literally says, this guy's done nothing.
[01:38:02.641 --> 01:38:04.642]  You said he had hundreds of millions of dollars hidden.
[01:38:04.903 --> 01:38:06.384]  You claimed he was stealing all this money.
[01:38:07.204 --> 01:38:08.325]  Oh, I forgot that part of the story.
[01:38:09.406 --> 01:38:09.546]  So,
[01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:14.291]  They bring in like five pages of transcript, and it's just regular computer paper.
[01:38:14.311 --> 01:38:15.831]  And he goes, this isn't an official transcript.
[01:38:15.932 --> 01:38:16.812]  I want the whole thing.
[01:38:16.832 --> 01:38:19.974]  30 minutes later, they go, sir, we actually have it right here.
[01:38:20.314 --> 01:38:22.495]  They had it off one of the side rooms they have with lawyers.
[01:38:23.175 --> 01:38:23.816]  It's this thick.
[01:38:23.896 --> 01:38:25.437]  Judge goes, all right, I'm taking a long recess.
[01:38:25.457 --> 01:38:26.317]  Go enjoy a large lunch.
[01:38:26.597 --> 01:38:28.058]  He comes back, comes back pissed.
[01:38:28.078 --> 01:38:30.759]  He walks in, he goes, all right, you're all fired.
[01:38:30.839 --> 01:38:33.421]  And this is his company, and I've never seen anything like this.
[01:38:34.701 --> 01:38:35.342]  And wow.
[01:38:36.798 --> 01:38:47.565]  Because they gave him a transcript of that Saturday show I did where I laid it out and played audio McGill when he filed a secret report that I was a criminal stealing money.
[01:38:47.585 --> 01:38:52.728]  And even though we'd already filed with the court months before and it was all made up and the judge knew it was all true.
[01:38:54.722 --> 01:39:06.950]  And then they filed the Sunday show and the Monday show, and the judge sat there and read every word I'd said in transcripts of audiotapes of these people, and me saying I got a lot more, which I do.
[01:39:08.151 --> 01:39:10.472]  This guy comes to my office a few months before that happened.
[01:39:11.152 --> 01:39:11.693]  He goes, Alex,
[01:39:14.972 --> 01:39:16.853]  I don't care if you just keep some money on the side.
[01:39:16.893 --> 01:39:17.674]  Why don't you do that?
[01:39:17.774 --> 01:39:18.814]  And I said, I don't do that.
[01:39:18.834 --> 01:39:19.455]  I go to jail.
[01:39:19.475 --> 01:39:20.675]  I don't care about it.
[01:39:20.735 --> 01:39:21.195]  It's all right.
[01:39:21.215 --> 01:39:21.836]  He worked with me.
[01:39:22.516 --> 01:39:24.037]  You can just keep all the money you want.
[01:39:24.297 --> 01:39:25.798]  I said, I gotta go to the bathroom real quick.
[01:39:25.818 --> 01:39:28.019]  I wouldn't go in the bathroom.
[01:39:28.079 --> 01:39:28.900]  I was, bloop!
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:30.180]  Bloop!
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:32.061]  Why don't you say that again?
[01:39:32.101 --> 01:39:33.002]  He was drunk in my office.
[01:39:33.022 --> 01:39:34.543]  Just like he was drunk on the telephone I recorded.
[01:39:35.343 --> 01:39:35.563]  Bloop!
[01:39:37.404 --> 01:39:39.065]  See, I'm a good person.
[01:39:39.305 --> 01:39:40.286]  I'm a nice person.
[01:39:40.306 --> 01:39:41.307]  I have a good family.
[01:39:41.367 --> 01:39:41.847]  Look them up.
[01:39:42.247 --> 01:39:43.548]  I don't come from garbage.
[01:39:46.781 --> 01:40:00.135]  So, we let them fill their hand, we gave them a lot of line to run out, and I've been really busy trying to stop them killing Trump and start World War III, but I told these people, before they shut us down,
[01:40:01.363 --> 01:40:02.564]  That I'm going to expose them.
[01:40:02.865 --> 01:40:05.547]  So I've got to spend some, it'll probably take me a day.
[01:40:05.728 --> 01:40:07.930]  I'll do it on a Saturday and a Sunday very soon.
[01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:10.613]  Maybe I'll do it tomorrow before I leave to Pennsylvania tomorrow.
[01:40:10.633 --> 01:40:13.556]  I'm playing speak with Tucker and others at this event.
[01:40:14.276 --> 01:40:16.098]  I'll just go ahead and put it all out on you.
[01:40:16.639 --> 01:40:18.260]  I'll put out the whole story of what happened.
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:20.002]  Then I'll put out the recordings for you.
[01:40:20.202 --> 01:40:21.384]  We'll see how you like that.
[01:40:24.166 --> 01:40:24.347]  So.
[01:40:29.633 --> 01:40:32.275]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but I've told you people a lot.
[01:40:32.295 --> 01:40:34.296]  If you want to fight, you came to the right place.
[01:40:35.717 --> 01:40:37.077]  You came to the right place.
[01:40:37.277 --> 01:40:37.758]  You understand that?
[01:40:38.758 --> 01:40:41.840]  Because I can't be bullied and I can't be bought and I can't be pushed around.
[01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:43.641]  And I'm real nice till I'm not.
[01:40:46.903 --> 01:40:49.785]  So you get that through your stinking brains.
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:53.480]  America's sick of the bullies.
[01:40:53.841 --> 01:40:55.381]  We're sick of our occupied government.
[01:40:55.401 --> 01:40:57.282]  We're sick of the Justice Department pedophiles.
[01:40:57.562 --> 01:40:59.922]  We're sick of the child slavery, the sex slavery.
[01:41:00.082 --> 01:41:01.403]  We're tired of the World War III.
[01:41:01.643 --> 01:41:02.743]  We're tired of the inflation.
[01:41:02.923 --> 01:41:04.364]  We're tired of you trying to kill the president.
[01:41:04.624 --> 01:41:06.324]  We're tired of you!
[01:41:08.345 --> 01:41:09.025]  And we're done!
[01:41:10.563 --> 01:41:26.724]  And you're so stupid, you think you'd give a judge hundreds of pages of me talking about them, and he'd learn every bit of it, and all the pieces he knew from the record were true, so he knew I was telling the truth, and you just exposed yourself, you dumb bastards!
[01:41:36.041 --> 01:41:37.542]  You're the crooks.
[01:41:38.583 --> 01:41:40.164]  You're the schemers.
[01:41:40.765 --> 01:41:43.727]  You work for the evil people that have hijacked this country.
[01:41:45.389 --> 01:41:46.730]  And everybody knows it.
[01:41:49.952 --> 01:41:50.733]  It's got a brain.
[01:41:53.275 --> 01:41:59.760]  So, without getting into the inside baseball, I'm gonna tell you and I'm gonna shoot you straight.
[01:42:00.741 --> 01:42:02.303]  I've been on air 30 plus years.
[01:42:02.423 --> 01:42:03.303]  I've had Infowars for 28.
[01:42:04.824 --> 01:42:05.945]  We've changed the world together.
[01:42:06.906 --> 01:42:11.612]  And in my 30 years, nothing we've ever done comes close to as important as what we're doing now.
[01:42:13.093 --> 01:42:18.039]  And they want us off the air, and we're also a symbol, like a standard for a Roman legion they want to capture.
[01:42:20.026 --> 01:42:21.207]  We're doing our best work ever.
[01:42:22.067 --> 01:42:23.348]  I need you to support us.
[01:42:23.468 --> 01:42:24.669]  I need you to share our reports.
[01:42:24.789 --> 01:42:25.729]  I need you to back us.
[01:42:25.889 --> 01:42:30.372]  I need you to go to drjonesnaturals.com and infowarstore.com.
[01:42:31.172 --> 01:42:33.113]  And I need you to get the products that are great.

[01:43:00.092 --> 01:43:02.073]  Don't snack on me with a kitty cat.

[01:43:49.315 --> 01:43:50.675]  America's fighting for our lives.
[01:43:50.856 --> 01:43:53.797]  If we just admit we're under attack and what we're up against, we'll win!
[01:43:54.777 --> 01:43:56.138]  But you gotta give me the ball.
[01:43:57.378 --> 01:43:58.659]  You gotta give this crew the ball.
[01:44:00.116 --> 01:44:01.437]  All we want to do is keep fighting.
[01:44:01.777 --> 01:44:02.237]  We love it.
[01:44:02.337 --> 01:44:03.397]  We love fighting tyranny.
[01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:05.298]  And we love you, but we need your backing.

[01:44:19.963 --> 01:44:21.904]  Two and a half years ago, he figured they were going to shut me down.
[01:44:21.924 --> 01:44:22.464]  He didn't even tell me.
[01:44:22.484 --> 01:44:23.464]  He went and set up a warehouse.
[01:44:24.744 --> 01:44:25.865]  Came up with even more supplements.
[01:44:27.267 --> 01:44:30.710]  And the globalists went after him and have been suing him for two years, cost him over a million and a half dollars.
[01:44:30.750 --> 01:44:31.611]  He's completely out of money.
[01:44:32.031 --> 01:44:34.353]  That's why you see the products are almost all sold out there.
[01:44:34.373 --> 01:44:42.100]  So he's taking every bit of money he's got and put in orders for products to start coming in in 10 days and then more in about 15 days.
[01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:44.522]  And then in 30 days, he's got six new products.
[01:44:45.243 --> 01:44:48.526]  Well, Turbo Force is coming back in and one other is coming in.
[01:44:48.606 --> 01:44:50.748]  Four new products and two originals coming back in.
[01:44:51.028 --> 01:44:54.171]  In the next month, he put in everything he's got.
[01:44:55.353 --> 01:45:01.334]  And my dad doesn't feel bad that they ran him to ground, and he used to be a guy with a couple million bucks in the bank, very successful dentist and businessman.
[01:45:02.495 --> 01:45:05.695]  My mom's proud, he's proud, but they've run my dad to the wall.
[01:45:06.536 --> 01:45:07.636]  They've run me to the wall.
[01:45:07.736 --> 01:45:09.156]  I don't have any more money.
[01:45:09.776 --> 01:45:16.278]  I've got lawyers that I can't pay right now that are gonna fight them in the bankruptcy court, and fight them when they try to take my name.
[01:45:17.358 --> 01:45:19.379]  And the lawyers say, we trust you, you'll pay us, we know.
[01:45:19.699 --> 01:45:20.199]  Well, listen.
[01:45:21.403 --> 01:45:23.684]  I need your support at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:45:24.364 --> 01:45:26.205]  They run my dad and mom to the wall.
[01:45:26.265 --> 01:45:32.528]  They bet everything, put their last savings in to buy the products that are coming in, to get back on their feet, and we'll keep fighting and we'll never stop.
[01:45:32.748 --> 01:45:34.289]  But we're literally down to empty.
[01:45:34.329 --> 01:45:36.029]  We're in a war, crushing globals.
[01:45:36.930 --> 01:45:39.651]  Winning, but the gas is going doot, doot, doot, doot, doot.
[01:45:40.431 --> 01:45:41.872]  Alert, alert, alert.
[01:45:42.372 --> 01:45:44.313]  Energy, energy, energy levels at
[01:45:45.848 --> 01:45:46.809]  Dissipation point.
[01:45:47.489 --> 01:45:48.810]  Energy, energy failing.
[01:45:48.930 --> 01:45:50.271]  Energy system's about to fail.
[01:45:50.452 --> 01:45:54.495]  Alert, alert.
[01:45:55.035 --> 01:45:57.457]  And you're all gonna freak out when we get taken off the air and they defeat me.
[01:45:58.197 --> 01:45:59.759]  Oh, then the support's gonna just flood in.
[01:45:59.959 --> 01:46:02.241]  But they're gonna be blowing stuff up and killing people by then.
[01:46:02.481 --> 01:46:03.241]  Martial law!
[01:46:03.421 --> 01:46:04.903]  They want us off the air before then!
[01:46:05.243 --> 01:46:06.844]  They wanted us off the air months ago!
[01:46:07.004 --> 01:46:08.886]  They want us off the air right during the election!
[01:46:10.677 --> 01:46:13.158]  They're not coming after me, they're coming after you!
[01:46:13.198 --> 01:46:14.118]  So spread the word!
[01:46:14.178 --> 01:46:14.458]  Vote!
[01:46:14.538 --> 01:46:15.238]  Pray to God!

[01:46:19.239 --> 01:46:19.999]  Buy the products!
[01:46:20.019 --> 01:46:20.619]  Just do it!

[01:46:34.445 --> 01:46:35.726]  The products that are left are amazing.
[01:46:35.786 --> 01:46:36.427]  Some of the best ones.
[01:46:36.447 --> 01:46:37.849]  Next Level Financial Energy about to sell out.
[01:46:38.249 --> 01:46:39.270]  Colloidal Silver, all of it.
[01:46:39.991 --> 01:46:48.520]  Infowarstore.com, the Nitric Boost and the Infowars MD Gummy Bears and Thousand Milligram Tincture, $40-$50 less than the leading competitor because we brought a label from them.
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:49.441]  It's all there.
[01:46:49.581 --> 01:46:50.702]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:46:51.721 --> 01:46:55.747]  The United States is like one of the top or most sick countries in the world.
[01:46:55.787 --> 01:46:57.629]  We spend more than anybody else per capita on
[01:47:06.601 --> 01:47:11.186]  All I have discovered that I can do is try to get things into the hands of patients as much as possible.
[01:47:11.206 --> 01:47:13.669]  That includes medication, that includes information, that includes awareness.
[01:47:27.485 --> 01:47:30.848]  And we have to help people navigate the system.
[01:47:30.908 --> 01:47:37.414]  I, unfortunately, Alex, I think where it's going to go is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.
[01:47:37.874 --> 01:47:40.116]  Explain what the wellness company does.
[01:47:40.877 --> 01:47:43.799]  And again, it's a lot bigger than just COVID or monkeypox.
[01:47:44.159 --> 01:47:45.861]  I mean, you're talking about a, you know,
[01:47:46.421 --> 01:47:50.582]  People, I think, are fearful of getting healthcare because it's going to be terribly expensive.
[01:48:11.207 --> 01:48:17.830]  The reality is you can deliver health care for the vast majority of your needs extremely effectively.
[01:48:18.170 --> 01:48:18.990]  We can do it.
[01:48:19.110 --> 01:48:20.831]  We can get cost-effective.
[01:48:20.871 --> 01:48:22.251]  We can get medication in your hands.
[01:48:22.571 --> 01:48:28.634]  What you guys are doing is getting people directly in touch with doctors, nurses, practitioners, and others and everything that they need.
[01:48:28.954 --> 01:48:32.555]  That's why I'm so excited about the wellness company and onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:48:32.735 --> 01:48:36.037]  Everybody needs to mark that down and get ahead of this in these uncertain times.
[01:48:36.277 --> 01:48:36.877]  If you don't
[01:48:37.097 --> 01:48:37.577]  All right.
[01:48:58.148 --> 01:48:59.108]  Link to use is onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:48:59.208 --> 01:48:59.448]  One word.

[01:49:00.488 --> 01:49:01.069]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:49:01.089 --> 01:49:01.749]  Appreciate it, Alex.
[01:49:01.769 --> 01:49:02.569]  Thank you so much.
[01:49:02.889 --> 01:49:03.969]  Well, that was a great interview.
[01:49:03.989 --> 01:49:06.490]  And again, he's one of the most prominent doctors in the world.
[01:49:24.753 --> 01:49:30.975]  And you could say, you know, kind of more mainline or whatever, but even he has come a long way and he's been standing up for free speech.
[01:49:31.396 --> 01:49:33.036]  And so the Wellness Company are awesome folks.
[01:49:33.056 --> 01:49:33.957]  They're a huge sponsor.
[01:49:34.237 --> 01:49:41.319]  These folks are the one-stop shop, and they've also got their spike protein detox on the site as well.
[01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:46.041]  So be sure and visit right now, onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:49:46.241 --> 01:49:47.882]  Onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:49:47.902 --> 01:49:50.003]  Again, I want to thank Dr. Drew for coming on.
[01:50:01.972 --> 01:50:02.934]  Take a look at what happened.
[01:50:06.139 --> 01:50:11.088]  Most importantly, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Trump is a threat to this nation.
[01:50:12.441 --> 01:50:13.201]  Assassination.
[01:50:14.102 --> 01:50:15.703]  You know what's interesting about assassination?
[01:50:16.283 --> 01:50:23.388]  Well, not only does it change those popularity polls in a big f***ing hurry, but it's also interesting to notice who it is we assassinate.
[01:50:23.408 --> 01:50:24.348]  You ever notice who it is?
[01:50:24.428 --> 01:50:25.949]  Stop to think of who it is we kill.
[01:50:26.309 --> 01:50:30.592]  It's always people who've told us to live together in harmony and try to love one another.
[01:50:31.072 --> 01:50:37.396]  Jesus, Gandhi, Lincoln, John Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, John Lennon.
[01:50:37.636 --> 01:50:39.678]  They all said, try to live together peacefully.
[01:50:39.698 --> 01:50:39.978]  Bam!
[01:50:40.738 --> 01:50:41.619]  Democrat, good morning.
[01:50:41.859 --> 01:50:44.001]  We let this man, Trump, destroy America.
[01:50:44.622 --> 01:50:48.286]  And I look at it and say, well, these two people had to step up and take that shot.
[01:50:48.726 --> 01:50:50.187]  I made it through, nothing to lose.
[01:50:50.988 --> 01:50:53.711]  I'm sorry, Willie, you're not advocating violence, are you?
[01:50:55.066 --> 01:50:56.507]  Not violent.
[01:50:56.627 --> 01:50:58.007]  I'm defending my country.
[01:50:58.468 --> 01:51:01.549]  A second apparent attempt on former President Trump's life.
[01:51:01.689 --> 01:51:04.971]  This time, the incident on his own golf course in Florida.
[01:51:04.991 --> 01:51:06.031]  They're trying to kill my father.
[01:51:06.071 --> 01:51:07.992]  They're trying to kill the 45th president of the United States.
[01:51:08.012 --> 01:51:09.093]  Five assassination teams.
[01:51:09.113 --> 01:51:10.293]  Are they all targeting Trump?
[01:51:10.333 --> 01:51:11.294]  Is it other officials?
[01:51:12.134 --> 01:51:13.254]  No, I should have been clear about that.
[01:51:13.594 --> 01:51:25.278]  Five teams that we know are targeting Trump, and so that raises real questions about why certain teams were being pulled off of the Trump deal detail and put on, for example, the Jill Biden detail.
[01:51:25.298 --> 01:51:31.380]  Was the Secret Service aware of these assassin teams before July 12th or before this past Sunday?
[01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:32.500]  They were.
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:42.104]  Yes, so the person was informing me of this information because the Secret Service was aware of the threat profile around President Trump.
[01:51:42.204 --> 01:51:52.189]  We were relieved to hear that you are doing your own independent investigation in Florida concerning the second assassination attempt on President Trump.
[01:51:53.729 --> 01:51:54.650]  My question to you tonight,
[01:51:56.331 --> 01:52:00.172]  Are the feds being cooperative with your investigation?
[01:52:00.192 --> 01:52:04.275]  Are you concerned that you're not getting the information you need?
[01:52:04.675 --> 01:52:05.755]  The answer is no.
[01:52:05.815 --> 01:52:06.896]  They're not being cooperative.
[01:52:06.936 --> 01:52:07.836]  Yes, I am concerned.
[01:52:07.876 --> 01:52:10.198]  I mean, for example, we were rebuffed.
[01:52:10.258 --> 01:52:13.579]  Our investigators were rebuffed just going to the fence line.
[01:52:13.659 --> 01:52:17.341]  Breaking reports indicate there may have been a third attempt on Trump's life.
[01:52:17.421 --> 01:52:20.103]  Approximately 20 patriots attended Trump's
[01:52:20.903 --> 01:52:25.646]  High-energy rally in Tucson are now reporting having to go to the ER immediately after the rally.
[01:52:26.227 --> 01:52:30.129]  The attendees all suffered from symptoms like blurry vision and swelling.
[01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:34.993]  Serious concerning reactions that all came on shortly after the rally ended.
[01:52:35.813 --> 01:52:41.537]  All of the affected were seated right by the stage where Trump made his entrance.
[01:52:42.478 --> 01:52:45.100]  Yeah, it wasn't the whole stage, it was right where he came on behind him.
[01:52:45.848 --> 01:52:50.372]  Now, that's why the police really think something happened, obviously, because they're not making this up.
[01:52:50.392 --> 01:52:55.236]  The doctors say, no, their eyes are full shut and they're very sick and headaches, nauseous.
[01:52:56.017 --> 01:52:57.718]  Right after the rally, they were reporting it.
[01:52:57.778 --> 01:53:02.222]  Thousands of people came out to hear former President Donald Trump speak last week.
[01:53:02.242 --> 01:53:07.306]  There was a group of 48 people allowed to sit on stage behind Trump throughout the event.
[01:53:07.326 --> 01:53:10.409]  They were split into two groups on each side of the stage.
[01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:12.451]  One side seemed to walk away without
[01:53:12.931 --> 01:53:15.994]  As soon as we left and I stepped outside, I started feeling like my eyes were burning.
[01:53:31.707 --> 01:53:33.429]  At first, she thought it might be allergies.
[01:53:33.669 --> 01:53:34.710]  She lives near Phoenix.
[01:53:34.770 --> 01:53:38.593]  By the time she got home, it was so bad she decided to go to the emergency room.
[01:53:38.633 --> 01:53:47.621]  Her initial thought of allergies went out the window when she heard from several others seated next to her at the rally that also ended up seeking medical attention with the same symptoms.
[01:53:47.801 --> 01:53:49.183]  It kept getting worse and worse.
[01:53:49.263 --> 01:53:50.864]  My eyes started watering a lot.
[01:53:51.364 --> 01:53:52.606]  My nose started running.
[01:53:53.246 --> 01:53:58.511]  Then I started feeling my face get really flushed and then my neck felt like it was on fire.
[01:53:58.931 --> 01:54:00.152]  It was all focused on my eyes.
[01:54:00.212 --> 01:54:02.933]  I mean, my eyes were red like hell, you know what I mean?
[01:54:02.973 --> 01:54:06.094]  It's like, it's just like unbearable.
[01:54:06.354 --> 01:54:08.515]  You just couldn't, I couldn't handle it.
[01:54:08.855 --> 01:54:09.715]  I just couldn't handle it.
[01:54:10.196 --> 01:54:10.456]  U.S.
[01:54:10.516 --> 01:54:16.018]  officials say there are now 130 suspected victims, mostly CIA operatives and U.S.
[01:54:16.078 --> 01:54:20.380]  diplomats being treated for brain injuries, debilitating headaches and vertigo.
[01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:24.241]  The targets they believe of a directed energy microwave weapon.
[01:54:24.501 --> 01:54:36.184]  There's a mysterious direct energy weapon that is being used and it is causing, in some cases, permanent traumatic brain injury.
[01:54:36.244 --> 01:54:39.385]  New indications suggest the incidents go as far back as 1996.
[01:54:40.885 --> 01:54:47.747]  Two individuals working on the NSC believe they were targeted in 2019 and in 2020, just after the election.
[01:54:47.767 --> 01:54:48.787]  That's him leaving.
[01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:52.570]  Probably whoever did it again had already left.
[01:54:53.951 --> 01:54:55.331]  She had a look a couple minutes before.
[01:54:56.491 --> 01:54:56.891]  Wow!
[01:54:57.711 --> 01:55:00.472]  I want you to listen to me very, very carefully.
[01:55:01.572 --> 01:55:13.714]  Back in early June, when the Justice Department ordered their agent outside of federal court order or any documents, not even a piece of toilet paper, to shut down InfoWars, they did that at the orders of the Biden administration.
[01:55:13.754 --> 01:55:14.354]  It's now come out.
[01:55:15.774 --> 01:55:18.495]  The judge blocked them and then fired them in a hearing two weeks later.
[01:55:19.366 --> 01:55:21.226]  The federally appointed U.S.
[01:55:21.266 --> 01:55:21.666]  trustee.
[01:55:21.686 --> 01:55:22.567]  The judge fired them.
[01:55:23.347 --> 01:55:24.587]  They are now back in the news.
[01:55:24.627 --> 01:55:38.169]  The Justice Department, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal, Justice Department is asking the judge at a hearing on Monday to close us and not allow the assets to be sold because they're worried we're going to have buyers, which we do, that are patriots.
[01:55:38.289 --> 01:55:38.909]  Overhead shot.
[01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:43.550]  Alex Jones bankruptcy trustee sale efforts challenged by the DOJ.
[01:55:44.250 --> 01:55:46.391]  Translation, the DOJ wants us shut.
[01:55:46.431 --> 01:55:47.591]  They've been behind it the whole time.
[01:55:48.592 --> 01:55:50.213]  Who's behind the Trump assassinations?
[01:55:50.493 --> 01:55:51.993]  Mayorkas, Garland.
[01:55:52.694 --> 01:55:55.895]  We now have Senator Hawley with a whistleblower from the Secret Service.
[01:55:57.156 --> 01:55:59.136]  They stood down at Mar-a-Lago last Sunday.
[01:55:59.477 --> 01:56:03.598]  Now they say there's three foreign hit teams, two domestic hit teams to kill Trump.
[01:56:03.638 --> 01:56:06.259]  That'll clearly be the cover when they do kill Trump, if they're able.
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:08.880]  I predict they would try to blame Iran before they did.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:09.721]  Now they're trying.
[01:56:11.442 --> 01:56:14.623]  We know Iran's working with the Democrats, hacked into Trump's servers for the campaign.
[01:56:15.981 --> 01:56:18.124]  This country is in a state of civil war already.
[01:56:18.164 --> 01:56:19.385]  The people against the globalists.
[01:56:19.405 --> 01:56:20.687]  They want to make it black versus white.
[01:56:22.029 --> 01:56:23.090]  This is so serious.
[01:56:23.110 --> 01:56:24.472]  So it's a lot bigger than Infowars.
[01:56:25.994 --> 01:56:29.839]  Them trying to kill Trump, them trying to take us off the air as vigilantes outside of a court order.
[01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:32.602]  Just order private security to come in here and do it.
[01:56:33.717 --> 01:56:35.459]  That's a canary in the coal mine.
[01:56:35.559 --> 01:56:38.821]  Like I said back when it happened in early June, and people said it can't be real.
[01:56:38.841 --> 01:56:41.083]  Then they were in the news the next day saying, yeah, we want it shut.
[01:56:41.404 --> 01:56:42.404]  Yeah, we tried to close the doors.
[01:56:42.465 --> 01:56:43.886]  Don't worry, we'll close on the 14th.
[01:56:44.086 --> 01:56:45.127]  They asked the judge to close it.
[01:56:45.287 --> 01:56:46.188]  The judge fired the U.S.
[01:56:46.208 --> 01:56:47.209]  trustee and the CRO.
[01:56:48.370 --> 01:56:50.732]  The Justice Department intervened in my case when we first filed it.
[01:56:51.012 --> 01:56:52.193]  They come to my depositions.
[01:56:52.213 --> 01:56:53.354]  They threaten me with U.S.
[01:56:53.374 --> 01:56:55.576]  code, saying, you say anything wrong, you're going to prison.
[01:56:56.732 --> 01:56:58.153]  They don't read your rights, remain silent.
[01:56:58.193 --> 01:57:00.074]  They say, we're going to catch you in something.
[01:57:00.294 --> 01:57:00.895]  And they didn't.
[01:57:00.915 --> 01:57:02.576]  And the judge said that on the June 14th thing.
[01:57:02.936 --> 01:57:07.139]  Three outside accounting firms, they sent in to try to destroy me and find something illegal.
[01:57:07.419 --> 01:57:14.584]  And they sent in the IRS and the IRS gave me a huge refund check of $4.3 million and said, we hardly ever see this.
[01:57:14.824 --> 01:57:20.628]  You overpaid taxes last four years over a million dollars every year because I was running everything to the company and putting it all into the company.
[01:57:21.108 --> 01:57:23.030]  I got a $9 million Bitcoin contribution.
[01:57:23.070 --> 01:57:23.810]  Put it in the company.
[01:57:24.350 --> 01:57:26.392]  Kept on air because that's the mission.
[01:57:28.078 --> 01:57:31.960]  At this critical time with 45 days left, we were supposed to already be off when they tried to kill Trump.
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:34.281]  Now they want me off before the election.
[01:57:34.501 --> 01:57:36.182]  And I raised this not about me.
[01:57:36.643 --> 01:57:38.483]  I'm a sentry on the parapet at night.
[01:57:39.084 --> 01:57:40.505]  And there's woods 100 yards away.
[01:57:40.905 --> 01:57:41.705]  And I see movement.
[01:57:41.845 --> 01:57:43.706]  And all of a sudden, the sentry next to me gets hit by an arrow.
[01:57:44.066 --> 01:57:47.168]  And I ring the alarm and I light the torches and say, we're under attack.
[01:57:47.208 --> 01:57:50.690]  And then 10,000 men, barbarians, rush out and put their
[01:57:52.642 --> 01:57:53.803]  Ladders up to the walls!
[01:57:53.843 --> 01:57:55.404]  They're climbing up the walls!
[01:57:55.464 --> 01:57:56.425]  That's the metaphor!
[01:57:57.025 --> 01:57:58.266]  That's... I'm a sentry!
[01:57:58.526 --> 01:57:59.427]  I'm a Paul Revere!
[01:57:59.467 --> 01:58:01.548]  They're literally flaming arrows are coming by my head!
[01:58:03.049 --> 01:58:07.072]  Mike Adams, NaturalNews.com, an incredible best-selling author, researcher, scientist, engineer.
[01:58:08.433 --> 01:58:17.820]  I was saying, probably took a bottle of water in Tucson a week and a half ago, when the only one group behind him in the stage, 20 people got sick, not the others on the other side, where he came in and where he left.
[01:58:18.851 --> 01:58:27.215]  You can take a bottle of water and the two chemicals you need and have the two tablets there and then put it in the water, put the top on once you're already in, then unscrew it, release chlorine gas or other things on people.
[01:58:27.815 --> 01:58:30.916]  But then it's the eyes and it's uniform.
[01:58:31.396 --> 01:58:36.439]  That would be a certain type of laser that's not visible to the eye that we know the Russians and Chinese use against our sailors.
[01:58:36.799 --> 01:58:38.320]  We know the Pentagon uses as well.
[01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:39.940]  Mike Adams nailed it.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.121]  It went viral last night.
[01:58:41.901 --> 01:58:43.742]  Most people are now leaning towards laser.
[01:58:43.762 --> 01:58:45.043]  The police say their eyes are burned.
[01:58:45.063 --> 01:58:45.904]  The doctors confirmed it.
[01:58:46.484 --> 01:58:47.745]  Mike Adams is here to talk about that.
[01:58:48.005 --> 01:58:50.027]  But first, all the rest of the news.
[01:58:50.467 --> 01:58:55.010]  What do you make of this announcement by the Justice Department wanting to shut us down openly, nakedly?
[01:58:55.710 --> 01:58:57.051]  The desperation is insane.
[01:58:58.252 --> 01:59:08.419]  And then the five hit teams, DHS warning Congress, the Secret Service whistleblower to the Senate saying there was a stand down.
[01:59:09.710 --> 01:59:13.613]  The enemy's moving forward, but everything they're doing is collapsing as people are asleep.
[01:59:13.653 --> 01:59:14.213]  Now they're awake.
[01:59:14.253 --> 01:59:14.854]  You agree with that?
[01:59:14.934 --> 01:59:17.456]  Naturalnews.com, the one and only Mike Adams.
[01:59:17.496 --> 01:59:21.719]  We'll get into the lasers and more, and your analysis of what's coming up in the next critical 45 days.
[01:59:21.739 --> 01:59:22.079]  Mike Adams.
[01:59:23.689 --> 01:59:48.878]  I think history will write about this collapse of this failed criminal cabal empire, and what they did to you will be one of the key chapters of the collapse of the rule of law, the complete abandonment of due process, in addition to the open borders, in addition to the massive out-of-control money printing, and also in addition to the weaponization of the US dollar all over the world, which
[01:59:49.298 --> 02:00:00.041]  Instead of creating more friends and allies, it pushed all the other countries into the BRICS currency system, which will go live strongly throughout 2025, more and more countries adopting it.
[02:00:00.541 --> 02:00:08.503]  And when that happens, Western civilization will find itself essentially economically blockaded by 80% of the world's population.
[02:00:09.063 --> 02:00:26.332]  And when that happens, we're going to go into something approaching Weimar-style hyperinflation, and the American people will find themselves absolutely impoverished and homeless, and losing almost all their assets as their homes are taken over by migrants that are flown and bused in and given their homes.
[02:00:26.793 --> 02:00:30.054]  So the Great Replacement has begun.
[02:00:30.074 --> 02:00:33.056]  There is no law remaining at the federal level.
[02:00:33.736 --> 02:00:45.641]  And if people want to survive this, they need to get to a red county in a red state with a constitutional sheriff and a reasonable district attorney who will prosecute criminals instead of prosecuting patriots.
[02:00:46.342 --> 02:00:47.002]  Absolutely.
[02:00:47.962 --> 02:00:52.584]  Give us your 35,000-foot view, one of the most accurate, you know, analysis I know out there.
[02:00:52.604 --> 02:00:53.945]  I watch your show almost every day.
[02:00:54.565 --> 02:00:58.867]  Big picture, then let's zoom in on the latest assassination attempts and all the intel that's coming out.
[02:00:59.918 --> 02:01:04.959]  Well, what Representative Matt Gaetz said about the five kill teams, there's no question that there are even more.
[02:01:05.559 --> 02:01:14.181]  I am going to repeat my public warning here because of my intel sources that there are surface-to-air missiles in possession of some of these kill teams.
[02:01:15.202 --> 02:01:19.683]  I think these may be even shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles.
[02:01:19.703 --> 02:01:24.464]  You know, small range, but they could take out potentially Trump's airplane.
[02:01:24.944 --> 02:01:28.209]  And I agree with what you said yesterday or the day before.
[02:01:28.670 --> 02:01:31.133]  Trump needs to, at this point, hunker down.
[02:01:31.454 --> 02:01:34.518]  He needs to just do live streams and interviews from a safe location.
[02:01:35.199 --> 02:01:39.966]  They're going to use increasingly dangerous area effect weapons.
[02:01:40.627 --> 02:01:41.388]  You've got the floor, sir.
[02:02:03.863 --> 02:02:26.489]  I like you I at first I thought maybe it was a chemical attack and then you know I used to live in Arizona and I've got a lot of contacts there I spoke with some key people yesterday the the victims of this directed energy weapons attack they they had sunburns essentially or you know something like sunburns on their exposed skin the redness of the eyes the some of them
[02:02:27.302 --> 02:02:28.343]  We're good to go.
[02:02:45.511 --> 02:02:46.732]  A directed energy weapon attack.
[02:02:46.752 --> 02:02:48.314]  And show what I have here.
[02:02:48.334 --> 02:02:53.478]  So this is the size of the device that could be used to achieve this.
[02:02:53.838 --> 02:02:57.221]  And what's really critical about this, now, the one I have here is IR.
[02:02:57.241 --> 02:03:02.005]  This is an IR illuminator, typically used by, you know, Mil-Spec or Hunters or whatever.
[02:03:02.485 --> 02:03:09.131]  But apparently you can get these in UV wavelengths, which would be somewhere between 280 nanometers to roughly 315 nanometers.
[02:03:12.589 --> 02:03:15.130]  Those wavelengths are, of course, invisible to the human eye.
[02:03:15.490 --> 02:03:20.891]  They also cannot be detected by night vision optics or video cameras.
[02:03:21.591 --> 02:03:37.635]  And they cause extreme damage to the eye, understanding, Alex, that in an indoor environment, the pupils are dilated and the optics of the eye act as a gain enhancement to the incoming photons.
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:44.315]  So because the pupils are more dilated indoors, where you're constricted outdoors because the sunlight is very bright, right?
[02:03:44.656 --> 02:03:46.060]  But indoors, it's not that bright.
[02:03:46.713 --> 02:04:05.262]  So your pupils are wide open and in that moment, an assailant, a malicious actor in the audience using nothing but one of these, they could fire this and they could wave it around and try to blind people who wouldn't even know they're being blinded in that moment.
[02:04:05.342 --> 02:04:06.762]  And I want to show you this.
[02:04:07.082 --> 02:04:09.043]  This device is powered by nothing but a 18650 battery.
[02:04:11.070 --> 02:04:16.012]  So with something this small and compact, somebody could have carried this out.
[02:04:16.052 --> 02:04:17.612]  And I believe that's what happened, Alex.
[02:04:17.692 --> 02:04:20.273]  I think there was a UV laser assailant.
[02:04:21.253 --> 02:04:23.034]  I doubt it was a state-level actor.
[02:04:23.154 --> 02:04:25.474]  I doubt it was the CIA or anything like that.
[02:04:25.854 --> 02:04:35.417]  Probably a lone actor, a lone person who was driven to hatred by the corporate media propaganda that's always saying that Trump is bad and Trump's a threat to democracy.
[02:04:36.077 --> 02:04:37.818]  So the good news is that
[02:04:38.624 --> 02:04:42.925]  There's an easy way to block this, and it's to wear sunglasses, even indoors.
[02:04:43.865 --> 02:04:48.946]  I mean, sunglasses block UV, and the effect on your skin is not going to kill you.
[02:04:49.386 --> 02:04:51.807]  But you've got to protect your eyes at these events.
[02:04:51.887 --> 02:04:57.047]  So right now, I got this information through other people to Trump's security team.
[02:04:58.108 --> 02:04:59.188]  They are reviewing this.
[02:04:59.768 --> 02:05:04.689]  I'm sure they're going to be now looking for people in the audience who might have devices like this.
[02:05:05.487 --> 02:05:14.771]  Especially if somebody is trying to, let's say, aim down the linear axis to aim it, because it's invisible, so it's hard to aim if you're a malicious actor.
[02:05:15.191 --> 02:05:24.794]  So if someone were to mount or glue sights on the top of a device like this, and then if they're trying to aim down that, that means they're trying to blast somebody.
[02:05:24.834 --> 02:05:27.495]  They're weaponizing a directed energy weapon.
[02:05:27.715 --> 02:05:28.816]  And I believe that's what happened.
[02:05:28.916 --> 02:05:34.038]  Let me ask the big question, and I think I know the answer, but I'm going to get your take on it.
[02:05:34.918 --> 02:05:37.800]  Why would Trump not have the same problem?
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:39.962]  They're obviously trying to hit Trump.
[02:05:40.502 --> 02:05:42.644]  It's hard to aim.
[02:05:42.984 --> 02:05:45.666]  These people are behind him at the same level.
[02:05:46.346 --> 02:05:49.148]  Obviously, then you look at the angle of what hit those people.
[02:05:49.168 --> 02:05:52.490]  So it was probably from the side or an angle not straight on.
[02:05:53.551 --> 02:05:56.234]  I think the answer is Trump is under the white lights.
[02:05:56.254 --> 02:06:01.059]  If you look at the footage of it, they're back kind of in the shadows with their eyes open.
[02:06:01.139 --> 02:06:07.345]  He's being blasted by bright lights, and so his pupils would be more closed, so he would get a lot less of it.
[02:06:07.365 --> 02:06:08.326]  Is that an accurate statement?
[02:06:09.067 --> 02:06:10.008]  You're exactly right.
[02:06:10.208 --> 02:06:12.911]  Also, Trump speaking is moving more.
[02:06:13.562 --> 02:06:18.264]  So he's moving around, just as you and I move around when we speak, whereas the audience members tend to be more still.
[02:06:19.225 --> 02:06:25.368]  Even then, it is absolutely possible that Trump could have been partially exposed to this and would not have known it.
[02:06:26.448 --> 02:06:28.189]  He would have just thought he had a hell of a headache.
[02:06:28.209 --> 02:06:33.512]  And just to back you up, my dad, when he was 14, won a statewide science fair.
[02:06:34.252 --> 02:06:38.357]  They got got tapped by UT to go to plan to he was 14 to UT.
[02:06:38.978 --> 02:06:41.541]  The next thing is they gave him a project a whiz kid project.
[02:06:41.901 --> 02:06:49.350]  They shipped to his ranch when he was off in the summer, a 18 Wheeler with a big grant from.
[02:06:50.541 --> 02:06:51.261]  Union Carbide.
[02:06:51.541 --> 02:06:52.682]  And I've seen photos of it and stuff.
[02:06:52.802 --> 02:06:53.902]  It's actually in a book he's got.
[02:06:53.942 --> 02:06:55.103]  I'm gonna bring it on here so I can show it.
[02:06:55.803 --> 02:06:58.764]  And he built a large ruby laser.
[02:06:59.504 --> 02:07:01.345]  Guys, type in a Union Carbide ruby laser, 1960s.
[02:07:01.425 --> 02:07:03.085]  It'll pull up their rubies.
[02:07:03.566 --> 02:07:07.147]  But he puts it on a capacitor on it, made it a particle beam, and then won another award for it.
[02:07:07.547 --> 02:07:10.268]  But he wore three pairs of sunglasses, but it wasn't enough.
[02:07:10.908 --> 02:07:13.851]  And it wasn't until he went to bed at night that he woke up and was blind for a week.
[02:07:13.931 --> 02:07:17.614]  They put bandages on, weren't sure it would come back, but his eyes were always damaged.
[02:07:17.634 --> 02:07:21.397]  And they went, they were so burned, they went from being blue to yellowish green.
[02:07:21.537 --> 02:07:28.683]  My dad has yellowish green eyes from the one laser accident from building the Union Carbide Laser as part of that Defense Department program he was in.
[02:07:28.943 --> 02:07:30.705]  But, I mean, that's just an example right there.
[02:07:31.746 --> 02:07:32.546]  Well, you're exactly right.
[02:07:33.427 --> 02:07:37.931]  The optics, I mean, the scarring of the retina can be permanent.
[02:07:38.756 --> 02:07:45.801]  And, you know, the people who were attacked in this case in Tucson, there's no question they will suffer some form of permanent damage.
[02:07:46.362 --> 02:07:49.864]  And I believe there will be an investigation.
[02:07:49.964 --> 02:07:52.746]  It's no doubt already begun to try to locate this individual.
[02:07:52.806 --> 02:07:54.467]  And also, I would imagine the U.S.
[02:07:54.487 --> 02:08:05.255]  Secret Service is checking online records for who has purchased relatively high-powered lasers or laser diodes within the range of nanometers that I set out there.
[02:08:05.695 --> 02:08:07.857]  But I do want to mention that typically
[02:08:08.337 --> 02:08:08.818]  We're good to go.
[02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:30.392]  You could call this a dual-use technology, right?
[02:08:30.692 --> 02:08:44.060]  So you could use it to sterilize a surgical room or a hospital room, but then somebody who's a malicious actor could also work it into a handheld device with specific optics and turn it into a weapon to try to blind people.
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:51.786]  So this is a whole new threat that we need to be aware of and understanding what Matt Gaetz said that there are going to be probably other threats.
[02:08:52.167 --> 02:08:52.927]  I'm very concerned.
[02:08:52.967 --> 02:08:59.453]  I know you are as well about the possibility of truck bombs or area effect weapons being deployed
[02:09:00.033 --> 02:09:09.138]  By the deep state or even foreign actors, Matt Gaetz mentioned possible groups from Pakistan or Iran or even Ukraine might be involved.
[02:09:09.438 --> 02:09:11.339]  And what kinds of weapons would they resort to?
[02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:13.300]  Would they blow up an entire building?
[02:09:13.601 --> 02:09:19.484]  Would they have access to a suitcase nuke with, you know, like a 10 kiloton warhead or something?
[02:09:20.428 --> 02:09:24.334]  Maybe a fraction of Hiroshima, but still absolutely devastating, could blow up city blocks.
[02:09:24.615 --> 02:09:32.888]  I mean, we are in an extremely dangerous time right now and this UV laser attack is probably the most mild attack that we're about to see.
[02:09:34.187 --> 02:09:35.188]  I totally agree, Mike.
[02:09:35.228 --> 02:09:39.211]  I mean, that's what I keep pinching myself, and I'm not lecturing listeners.
[02:09:39.372 --> 02:09:43.015]  I have trouble wrapping my mind around the historic point we were in.
[02:09:43.775 --> 02:09:45.997]  It's not a civil war because it's globalist against America.
[02:09:46.037 --> 02:09:48.099]  They're billing it as a civil war, an information civil war.
[02:09:48.119 --> 02:09:49.540]  They're openly calling for the arrest of everybody.
[02:09:49.781 --> 02:09:50.982]  They're passing laws in California.
[02:09:51.002 --> 02:09:53.264]  Hillary's saying arrest people for disinfo that she defines.
[02:09:53.924 --> 02:09:55.706]  That, to me, shows serious desperation.
[02:09:55.746 --> 02:09:58.668]  How would you define the time we're in with 45 days left?
[02:10:00.836 --> 02:10:05.178]  Well, we are in the last chapter of a U.S.
[02:10:05.258 --> 02:10:11.440]  empire that has been on a suicide path for quite some time, financially and otherwise, geopolitically.
[02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:17.382]  And I do want to say, even if Trump is sworn in in January,
[02:10:18.601 --> 02:10:21.383]  That cannot stop history from playing out here.
[02:10:21.403 --> 02:10:40.634]  The warmongering neocons and the assassins and the color revolution leaders of the American empire that have been basically operating this since the assassination of JFK, they are on their last legs and so they're in desperation mode and there's nothing they won't do at this point.
[02:10:40.654 --> 02:10:42.815]  There's no limit to the number of even Americans
[02:10:43.496 --> 02:10:43.616]  It's
[02:11:02.094 --> 02:11:17.288]  A seemingly imminent attack on Lebanon, even with US assistance, is highly questionable whether Israel's efforts can continue to be sustained without Israel suffering devastating economic consequences that are already well underway.
[02:11:17.548 --> 02:11:24.655]  And Western Europe's economy has been absolutely devastated by the lack of energy due to the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines that you've covered.
[02:11:25.295 --> 02:11:26.275]  Quite substantially.
[02:11:26.676 --> 02:11:27.596]  So the U.S.
[02:11:27.676 --> 02:11:32.117]  empire has not created global freedom and prosperity, and the U.S.
[02:11:32.177 --> 02:11:46.842]  empire can no longer lecture China about human rights when FDA agents are organ harvesting children in America in order to do genetically altered humanized mice experiments, and when you have peaceful protesters
[02:11:47.182 --> 02:11:47.783]  We're good to go.
[02:12:04.075 --> 02:12:10.057]  In other words, Yemen has more advanced cruise missile technology than does the entire United States military?
[02:12:10.417 --> 02:12:11.838]  The answer to that question is yes.
[02:12:12.378 --> 02:12:12.718]  Yes.
[02:12:13.118 --> 02:12:14.219]  Let me just pause you there.
[02:12:14.239 --> 02:12:20.881]  Let me pause you there because everybody's giving attention to Israel capturing the shipment of walkie-talkies and pagers and bombing tens of thousands of people, a lot of them innocent.
[02:12:21.961 --> 02:12:24.102]  And it's wrong when Hezbollah does terrorist stuff or Hamas.
[02:12:24.142 --> 02:12:25.023]  It's wrong when Israel does it.
[02:12:25.043 --> 02:12:25.983]  I call this a terror attack.
[02:12:26.423 --> 02:12:26.964]  We're good to go.
[02:12:45.709 --> 02:12:47.370]  The issue here is it's not getting any coverage.
[02:12:47.851 --> 02:12:59.159]  There are now, as you pointed out, hypersonic missiles fired in the region into Israel that are getting through the Iron Dome and blowing up train stations, buildings, military bases, and it's barely getting on the news.
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:00.861]  That is a big development.
[02:13:00.981 --> 02:13:05.804]  Israel really is, which I don't even like, folks, because they've got nuclear weapons that are going to escalate to the Samson option.
[02:13:06.265 --> 02:13:07.206]  Israel's losing this.
[02:13:09.567 --> 02:13:13.771]  And I would add that what Israel just did with the pagers and the two-way radios in
[02:13:15.187 --> 02:13:18.210]  This is causing panic among the telecommunications industry.
[02:13:18.570 --> 02:13:21.633]  The economic impact of this will be long-term and devastating.
[02:13:22.454 --> 02:13:29.800]  Even insurance companies will drop companies that import electronics that even touched Israel in any way whatsoever.
[02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:32.523]  And by the way, as you were about to say, more bombs went off today.
[02:13:33.523 --> 02:13:40.690]  They've moved on from phones and pagers to other devices, and now it's clear that they're hacking into solar arrays and burning people's houses down.
[02:13:42.146 --> 02:13:56.511]  Yeah, look, I would say to the audience, wherever you stand on the Israel issue, Google and Apple have spent billions of dollars trying to convince people to keep their electronics in their pockets and in their hands and close to their faces and eyeballs at all times.
[02:13:56.971 --> 02:14:08.775]  And now, people are realizing that electronics that are distributed for consumer consumption, that those electronics can explode, they can be remotely detonated by a government if that government does not like you.
[02:14:09.355 --> 02:14:16.966]  Now, what Israel just demonstrated is what many Americans have long feared, that are these devices rigged against us?
[02:14:17.326 --> 02:14:24.817]  Could the United States government literally send out a detonation signal that is selective to the metadata profile of conservative
[02:14:25.797 --> 02:14:39.485]  In other words, could there be a widespread, simultaneous detonation of all iPhones or Google Android mobile phone devices that are used by conservatives or Trump supporters or Christians or gun owners?
[02:14:39.886 --> 02:14:43.428]  And that question might have seemed like science fiction a week ago.
[02:14:43.828 --> 02:14:44.848]  No longer science fiction.
[02:14:45.409 --> 02:14:48.951]  Or what about, can they detonate home appliances that are connected to the Internet?
[02:14:49.291 --> 02:14:50.932]  Can they detonate electric vehicles?
[02:14:52.054 --> 02:14:54.558]  I was about to say, electric vehicles are the real bombs.
[02:14:54.738 --> 02:14:56.681]  And again, they don't need to put explosives in these.
[02:14:57.182 --> 02:15:03.592]  A lot of these devices, like electric cars or solar panels, they can give them an order that makes them feed back.
[02:15:03.912 --> 02:15:04.633]  And you're an engineer.
[02:15:04.673 --> 02:15:06.196]  Explain how these become so explosive.
[02:15:06.957 --> 02:15:14.484]  Well, just very high amperage drain on lithium-ion batteries will push their temperature to the point of spontaneous combustion.
[02:15:15.025 --> 02:15:22.832]  So, all lithium-ion batteries are effectively explosives that have to be tightly controlled by the onboard circuitry to limit the drain.
[02:15:23.544 --> 02:15:31.867]  But, and for electric vehicles, all firefighters and emergency responders know that once that lithium-ion fire begins, you can't put it out with water.
[02:15:31.927 --> 02:15:33.987]  You can't put it out with almost anything.
[02:15:34.408 --> 02:15:36.448]  And that's why EV fires are so devastating.
[02:15:36.728 --> 02:15:47.872]  But can software or a hack be used to initiate a high-drain event that leads to the spontaneous combustion of an electric bus or electric car, electric vehicle or truck?
[02:15:48.616 --> 02:15:49.157]  Absolutely.
[02:15:49.457 --> 02:15:50.899]  The answer is absolutely yes.
[02:15:50.979 --> 02:15:54.563]  If you're driving an EV, you're driving around on a ticking time bomb.
[02:15:55.003 --> 02:16:02.531]  And almost all the EVs, at least that I can think of, are connected to the car manufacturers via satellite or other means.
[02:16:02.892 --> 02:16:04.814]  So you're driving around on a bomb.
[02:16:05.579 --> 02:16:06.559]  There's no other way to put it.
[02:16:07.060 --> 02:16:10.581]  I would much rather have a diesel truck with diesel in the tank.
[02:16:10.601 --> 02:16:11.861]  Diesel's hard to combust.
[02:16:12.342 --> 02:16:13.942]  It's not connected to the internet.
[02:16:14.482 --> 02:16:18.944]  I can store fuel safely with diesel, and it doesn't tax the power grid.
[02:16:18.964 --> 02:16:21.545]  And if the power grid's down, I can still refill the diesel.
[02:16:22.105 --> 02:16:23.306]  Diesel truck, all the way.
[02:16:23.346 --> 02:16:28.908]  You can easily put a 500-gallon tank at your farm or wherever, and you're going to be fine when everything's down and use the car to recharge everything.
[02:16:29.568 --> 02:16:35.875]  Since you raised this, I want to get into Ford when we come back and then into the big picture with the assassination teams and what you think they're going to pull next with Mike Adams.
[02:16:37.034 --> 02:16:37.975]  NaturalNews.com.
[02:16:38.015 --> 02:16:45.522]  But Ford is being investigated by the FBI for listening to people for years inside their cars with embedded microphones.
[02:16:45.562 --> 02:16:47.003]  Well, what's an Alexa?
[02:16:47.223 --> 02:16:48.705]  What's your phone?
[02:16:48.765 --> 02:16:52.648]  The CIA director said 12 years ago, you know, we're listening to you in your house through your appliances.
[02:16:53.229 --> 02:16:58.974]  And so we need to understand why are they now admitting this is going on and acting like—I'm not defending Ford, by the way—why Ford
[02:16:59.855 --> 02:17:03.199]  He's the bad guy for doing stuff that's been going on for at least 20 years.
[02:17:03.259 --> 02:17:09.545]  Naturalnews.com, brighteon.com, where are the other best places where we'll find the incredible work of Mike Adams?
[02:17:10.186 --> 02:17:16.913]  Well, I'm on Health Ranger on X now that Elon's put me back on there, so I'm posting every day.
[02:17:17.808 --> 02:17:18.288]  Stay there.

[02:18:32.529 --> 02:18:34.070]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:39.675]  I'm gonna just take a few deep breaths here on air.
[02:18:39.695 --> 02:18:51.184]  And just sit back intellectually, coldly,
[02:18:52.506 --> 02:18:53.327]  And look at where we are.
[02:18:54.788 --> 02:18:57.990]  And then emotionally drive myself once I've made the cold decisions.
[02:18:58.010 --> 02:18:58.530]  That's what I do.
[02:19:01.312 --> 02:19:07.576]  Because the emotion, you're supposed to make a decision, not an emotion, but then use the emotion to drive you through the cold decision you've made.
[02:19:08.757 --> 02:19:09.597]  That's my worldview.
[02:19:10.358 --> 02:19:14.060]  And we have a learned helplessness, we have a normalcy bias, a mass Stockholm syndrome.
[02:19:14.141 --> 02:19:14.881]  I have it as well.
[02:19:15.782 --> 02:19:16.662]  Not as bad as some.
[02:19:17.763 --> 02:19:20.265]  But what I'm telling you is something I'm telling myself that I'm not preaching at you.
[02:19:21.403 --> 02:19:30.886]  That it's hard to gauge just how bad things are, but that's not a negative in the final equation, because you've got to admit the position you're in to get out of it.
[02:19:33.206 --> 02:19:40.428]  So make no mistake, you're living in the crossroads of the future destiny of the world, and humanity is rallying.
[02:19:40.448 --> 02:19:41.669]  A lot of good things are happening, but
[02:19:42.455 --> 02:19:48.438]  The corruption, the things that were set up decades ago, the evil of people in control should not be underestimated.
[02:19:49.179 --> 02:20:00.445]  And what they'll do to stay in power, I mean, announcing last week they're going to start bombing Russia with US and NATO, UK storm shadow missiles, which is an act of war, which is a declaration of war.
[02:20:00.685 --> 02:20:02.066]  In Russia, that's a declaration of war, you do that.
[02:20:02.986 --> 02:20:06.388]  And then this giant ammo depot blows up and they claim it's a drone, probably a storm shadow.
[02:20:06.968 --> 02:20:08.709]  Biden even said, well, we're not going to take credit for it.
[02:20:08.749 --> 02:20:09.990]  Well, when these go off, they're going to know.
[02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:23.457]  Just that alone, you look at the human sex trafficking and the slave labor and the testimony in Congress by senior border patrols saying, yeah, they order us to cover up the kidnapped kids and stop the DNA testing.
[02:20:24.522 --> 02:20:26.904]  To a lot of the public, I mean, they are at war with us.
[02:20:26.964 --> 02:20:28.646]  They are gutting the country right now.
[02:20:29.206 --> 02:20:34.010]  So, I mean, I don't even have words to describe how bad it is, but you've got to admit you're in a crisis.
[02:20:34.911 --> 02:20:44.139]  Now, I want to get into the attacks on the First Amendment, more on the technocracy and how they can drive your driverless car, your car, most cars already have remote control, they don't tell you that, or the planes off a cliff.
[02:20:45.387 --> 02:20:53.112]  They can blow up basically any appliance they want that's got capacitors in it, some of them explosively, you know, very spectacularly start fires or worse, explosions.
[02:20:53.972 --> 02:21:01.957]  And they're now just bragging how they're, it's not just a social credit score that turns off your credit card or fires you or takes your bank account if you don't let Junior get his Johnson cut off.
[02:21:02.557 --> 02:21:07.040]  It's that they can literally tell you what you can eat, what you can do, where you can go.
[02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:10.462]  I mean, this is a communist or totalitarian or fascist dream.
[02:21:11.923 --> 02:21:18.026]  So, Mike, I want to walk through some of that with you here and get into forward listening to people over microphones, which is, again, everywhere.
[02:21:18.046 --> 02:21:18.726]  It's not just forward.
[02:21:18.766 --> 02:21:19.907]  I'm not defending them, as I said.
[02:21:21.267 --> 02:21:23.708]  But a lot of people just don't feel up to this.
[02:21:23.728 --> 02:21:24.349]  I want them to know that.
[02:21:24.849 --> 02:21:30.331]  If you're not consciously aware and already ready, how are you ever going to start doing the other things to get ready physically?
[02:21:31.072 --> 02:21:32.712]  So don't feel overwhelmed.
[02:21:32.852 --> 02:21:35.774]  Realize that there should be great opportunity in this as well.
[02:21:36.929 --> 02:21:42.311]  And that we're going to be looked to, those of you that have warned people ahead of time and have done some preparation, as the leaders of the future.
[02:21:42.571 --> 02:21:43.791]  And yeah, I know you don't want to be a leader.
[02:21:43.811 --> 02:21:45.611]  Neither do I. I'm just a private guy.
[02:21:45.631 --> 02:21:50.053]  But you're going to have to be a leader if we're going to beat this and if you're going to survive.
[02:21:50.813 --> 02:21:52.493]  So, this can run from bad to worse.
[02:21:52.533 --> 02:21:57.635]  Mike, you're really good at this and one of the best at taking off the gloves and getting rid of the candy coating.
[02:21:59.429 --> 02:22:00.811]  Define the situation we're in.
[02:22:00.831 --> 02:22:02.112]  You already defined the end of an empire.
[02:22:02.152 --> 02:22:03.213]  I agree that's what's triggering all this.
[02:22:03.233 --> 02:22:14.245]  But the situation we're in, if it runs from bad to worse, what's the spectrum of a controlled crash landing we culturally, economically, physically survive versus how bad it could get in the worst scenarios?
[02:22:14.305 --> 02:22:14.706]  Mike Adams.
[02:22:15.754 --> 02:22:18.637]  This is ultimately, of course, a spiritual war.
[02:22:18.697 --> 02:22:25.002]  There's a satanic takeover of the institutions of our world, especially of Western civilization.
[02:22:25.643 --> 02:22:28.706]  And I assume you know this, Alex.
[02:22:29.166 --> 02:22:32.830]  Me, personally, I'm transitioning out of the world of commercial.
[02:22:33.090 --> 02:22:35.212]  My new church goes live in November.
[02:22:36.170 --> 02:22:43.636]  And I'm teaching a hundred Bible sermons, all non-commercial, just about nutrition as part of the spiritual war.
[02:22:43.937 --> 02:22:49.821]  And this is why I strongly recommend that people go to your store at drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:22:49.841 --> 02:22:50.702]  Is that the right URL?
[02:22:51.483 --> 02:22:51.743]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:51.763 --> 02:22:52.243]  I think that is.
[02:22:52.464 --> 02:22:54.065]  I think that's, yeah, drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:22:54.545 --> 02:22:55.006]  Here's why.
[02:22:55.906 --> 02:22:56.707]  Leviticus, chapter 17.
[02:22:58.689 --> 02:23:01.231]  The life of the flesh is in the blood.
[02:23:02.125 --> 02:23:17.570]  What that means is that you cannot win a spiritual war if your blood is filled with contaminants and pollutants and toxins, which is what the establishment is trying to feed us all the time through what I call their shadow food, their shadow medicine, their shadow pharmaceuticals.
[02:23:18.190 --> 02:23:20.570]  And you've got to purify your blood.
[02:23:20.670 --> 02:23:31.332]  That is done through God's natural molecules, which are found in things like turmeric, and like grapes with resveratrol, and like, you know, everything.
[02:23:31.852 --> 02:23:32.413]  Cumin seed.
[02:23:32.453 --> 02:23:33.373]  I mean, you name it.
[02:23:33.593 --> 02:23:36.053]  All the herbs and foods that are mentioned in the Bible.
[02:23:36.513 --> 02:23:40.014]  The figs, the pomegranates, and the extracts of those.
[02:23:40.094 --> 02:23:41.494]  These are all God's molecules.
[02:23:41.934 --> 02:23:45.735]  I call it, from Ephesians 6, the nutritional armor of God.
[02:23:46.275 --> 02:24:02.286]  You're putting on the armor of God when you are taking in nutritional supplements and superfoods that contain those molecules, and it is then at the blood level beginning to purify your body so that you can fight the spiritual war at the next level.
[02:24:03.343 --> 02:24:11.795]  In other words, nutrition, Alex, and I know you know this, nutrition is a critical and necessary element for us to fight and win the spiritual war.
[02:24:12.275 --> 02:24:16.361]  You can't win this war, even the PSYOP war, the fifth generation warfare,
[02:24:17.046 --> 02:24:29.593]  If your mind doesn't work because, you know, if somebody's out there smoking crack all day or abusing drugs all day or they have all these toxins or all these jab nanoparticles and these foreign alien proteins in their blood.
[02:24:29.974 --> 02:24:32.095]  That's why the vaccines attack the blood, Alex.
[02:24:32.395 --> 02:24:42.721]  It's a satanic agenda to contaminate the blood and make it so that people cannot achieve the level of purity that God required in the Old Testament for people to even enter the tabernacle.
[02:24:43.317 --> 02:24:45.638]  You can't enter the tabernacle unless you are purified.
[02:24:46.018 --> 02:24:50.680]  You can't be purified if you keep taking these jabs and keep eating the shadow food and the shadow medicine.
[02:24:50.700 --> 02:24:56.922]  So the Mark of the Beast is not just worship the beast, follow all its orders under a social credit score, and then have a digital face scanner, palm print.
[02:24:57.482 --> 02:25:02.684]  It's a digital tattoo, literally, that begins to take over your body and make you a new creature.
[02:25:04.341 --> 02:25:04.982]  Yeah, absolutely, 100%.
[02:25:05.962 --> 02:25:14.410]  And what I know you communicate to your audience is how this war for human survival has to be fought on every single level.
[02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:17.772]  The good news is that God gave us the tools to fight this.
[02:25:17.832 --> 02:25:19.614]  God gave us consciousness, free will.
[02:25:20.094 --> 02:25:23.397]  And for those who still have a backbone, you know, God gave you your backbone, right?
[02:25:23.757 --> 02:25:29.382]  But God also put all these plants and herbs, including, you know, CBD or cannabinoids.
[02:25:29.502 --> 02:25:32.485]  Why does the body have an endocannabinoid receptor system?
[02:25:32.905 --> 02:25:35.947]  Why does the body have nicotine receptors on most of its organs?
[02:25:36.407 --> 02:25:42.350]  Nicotine, not smoking, but just nicotine, is actually... Oh yeah, that's my new song, God is With Us.
[02:25:42.390 --> 02:25:43.330]  I just put that out today.
[02:25:43.570 --> 02:25:46.592]  But nicotine prevents infections.
[02:25:46.952 --> 02:25:48.933]  Nicotine builds strength.
[02:25:49.253 --> 02:25:49.714]  We're good to go.
[02:26:05.988 --> 02:26:06.569]  We're good.
[02:26:26.871 --> 02:26:27.212]  Absolutely.
[02:26:27.332 --> 02:26:33.577]  Looking at Trump and the numbers and what these assassination teams, the minute I saw that yesterday with Congressman Gates,
[02:26:55.379 --> 02:26:59.422]  I don't want to imagine that possibility, but I believe that God already intervened and saved Trump once.
[02:26:59.442 --> 02:27:00.102]  God needs to use Trump.
[02:27:25.419 --> 02:27:31.440]  In the way that he used many characters throughout the Bible, some of whom weren't all pure, perfect people, right?
[02:27:31.900 --> 02:27:33.260]  God doesn't require perfection.
[02:27:33.660 --> 02:27:34.721]  God requires obedience.
[02:27:35.401 --> 02:27:36.681]  And God can use Trump.
[02:27:37.241 --> 02:27:40.422]  I believe God saved Trump so that Trump can help save this republic.
[02:27:41.082 --> 02:27:44.722]  And so I believe God has protection around Trump.
[02:27:44.782 --> 02:27:48.503]  And that's why there have been so many failed attempts to assassinate him.
[02:27:48.743 --> 02:27:50.323]  So I don't believe they're going to succeed.
[02:27:50.604 --> 02:27:53.184]  I think the real test is going to be what happens after Trump wins.
[02:27:54.295 --> 02:28:12.045]  That's the real test because, you know, for what is it, eight weeks or ten weeks or whatever it is before he's sworn in, the radical leftists are going to thrust America into absolute chaos with revolts, with wars, with detonations, false flags, anything that the radical left can do to bring America to its knees.
[02:28:12.605 --> 02:28:16.027]  And I was just interviewing a contact yesterday in my studio.
[02:28:16.047 --> 02:28:16.788]  I haven't aired it yet.
[02:28:17.348 --> 02:28:22.411]  But he confirms there are explosive vests that have been brought into the US.
[02:28:22.451 --> 02:28:24.893]  There are radiological dirty bomb explosive vests.
[02:28:24.913 --> 02:28:29.136]  So suicide vests with dirty bomb material embedded in the vests.
[02:28:29.536 --> 02:28:30.656]  Those came across the border.
[02:28:30.997 --> 02:28:33.458]  The US State Department knows that these exist.
[02:28:33.718 --> 02:28:36.060]  They know that there are storage facilities across America.
[02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:44.627]  And the reason they gave phones to so many of these military-age males coming across the border is because they told them, your phone, you're going to receive instructions.
[02:28:44.927 --> 02:28:45.788]  GPS coordinates.
[02:28:46.068 --> 02:28:47.449]  You go to this storage facility.
[02:28:47.730 --> 02:28:48.610]  You pick up mortars.
[02:28:48.671 --> 02:28:49.591]  You pick up night vision.
[02:28:49.611 --> 02:28:50.812]  You pick up ballistic armor.
[02:28:51.133 --> 02:28:53.635]  Then, boom, here's your next task.
[02:28:53.875 --> 02:28:54.656]  GPS coordinates.
[02:28:54.916 --> 02:28:55.957]  You go take out that bridge.
[02:28:56.237 --> 02:28:57.998]  You go mortar that refinery.
[02:28:58.319 --> 02:29:00.841]  They're going to commit sabotage across America.
[02:29:01.041 --> 02:29:03.024]  They're going to take out power grid substations.
[02:29:03.325 --> 02:29:07.050]  They're going to take out ports, highways, water supply systems, power grid systems.
[02:29:07.691 --> 02:29:09.895]  They're going to be given the coordinates to do it, Alex.
[02:29:10.436 --> 02:29:12.940]  This has all been planned by Mallorcas.
[02:29:13.593 --> 02:29:17.094]  I mean, our country has been ruled by absolute traitors.
[02:29:17.475 --> 02:29:19.595]  They built the invasion camps in Panama.
[02:29:19.935 --> 02:29:23.337]  Michael Yan and Ann VanderSteel and others have thoroughly documented this.
[02:29:23.357 --> 02:29:25.498]  You've had many guests on your show that documented this.
[02:29:26.098 --> 02:29:36.282]  We are going to face a total kinetic eruption and internal domestic sabotage operation that was planned by our own illegitimate government.
[02:29:36.842 --> 02:29:38.082]  It's going to be unleashed against us.
[02:29:41.129 --> 02:29:42.289]  What do you think I ought to talk about?
[02:29:42.309 --> 02:29:51.693]  Because having written notes yet, when I'm on Tucker's podcast, not just the big crowd, in tens of thousands in Redding, Pennsylvania next Monday, what do you think I ought to get into?
[02:29:52.113 --> 02:29:53.894]  What do you think the message should be?
[02:29:54.434 --> 02:29:55.274]  Not just for this show.
[02:29:55.294 --> 02:30:05.198]  If you had five minutes to talk to the American people on national television, or five minutes to talk to Trump, what would that five minutes be?
[02:30:07.048 --> 02:30:22.903]  I would focus on breaking the sorcerer's spell, which is the fake mainstream media narratives, the lying polls, all the sources of disinformation that are designed to mesmerize people and to make you lose hope.
[02:30:23.757 --> 02:30:26.320]  You've got to break the sorcerer's spell.
[02:30:26.921 --> 02:30:33.688]  And the real support for Donald Trump across this country is almost certainly 70, 80 percent.
[02:30:34.008 --> 02:30:36.771]  Some people put it as high as possibly even 90 percent.
[02:30:37.811 --> 02:30:40.712]  And even in states like New York, Trump is well above 50%.
[02:30:40.972 --> 02:30:43.653]  Trump can win New York in an honest election.
[02:30:44.213 --> 02:30:49.535]  But too many people, members of Congress in particular, they operate out of a sense of fear.
[02:30:49.915 --> 02:30:53.596]  Well, what happens if the news writes a mean story about me?
[02:30:53.916 --> 02:31:01.238]  Or what happens if somebody criticizes me for shutting down the government because we want to put the SAVE Act in place and stop illegals from voting?
[02:31:02.639 --> 02:31:03.339]  We're done with that.
[02:31:03.759 --> 02:31:05.440]  No more lukewarm politicians.
[02:31:05.960 --> 02:31:06.640]  We're done with that.
[02:31:07.623 --> 02:31:14.108]  It's time to stand for principles peacefully, but with discipline, with dedication.
[02:31:14.888 --> 02:31:17.310]  And there are people who are willing to do that.
[02:31:17.470 --> 02:31:21.953]  Thomas Massey, Matt Gaetz, Senator Rand Paul, for example.
[02:31:22.493 --> 02:31:29.758]  I interviewed a congressman in Texas, Congressman Cloud, who told me many of the same things that I'm saying to you.
[02:31:30.339 --> 02:31:31.960]  And he's a pastor, by the way.
[02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.962]  His future, I mean, his past was with a church.
[02:31:35.623 --> 02:31:36.163]  He gets it.
[02:31:36.644 --> 02:31:50.954]  And there are people ready to serve this nation, but the top people in charge right now, they are mesmerized, they are hypnotized by the sorcerer's spells, which is the PSYOP fifth-generation warfare agenda.
[02:31:51.555 --> 02:32:03.063]  And Alex, the reason that they want to shut you down so badly is because you and I and Owen Schroyer and Harrison and everybody there and Chase Geyser, you know what we all are?
[02:32:03.563 --> 02:32:04.464]  We are spellbreakers.
[02:32:05.259 --> 02:32:06.400]  We are spell breakers.
[02:32:06.800 --> 02:32:10.842]  We break the spells and people shake their heads and go, whoa, why didn't I see that before?
[02:32:11.323 --> 02:32:12.363]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:32:12.743 --> 02:32:16.506]  It's funny you just said that because before we came into the segment, I was going to say, we've got to break our condition.
[02:32:16.526 --> 02:32:17.606]  We've got to come out of the trance.
[02:32:17.766 --> 02:32:22.609]  I was going to say towards Simpatico, it's a trance, a willful trance.
[02:32:22.629 --> 02:32:23.950]  You've got to admit you're being lied to.
[02:32:23.970 --> 02:32:28.813]  You've got to literally ask God to come into you, give you the Holy Spirit to give you discernment, to lead God and direct you.
[02:32:28.873 --> 02:32:30.033]  And that's really what they hate.
[02:32:30.173 --> 02:32:33.575]  They hate the show because of the guest and the history of the 30 years.
[02:32:34.980 --> 02:32:37.983]  They picked it first to demonize and go after as a beta test.
[02:32:38.003 --> 02:32:40.585]  They've admitted that in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, CNN.
[02:32:41.145 --> 02:32:46.890]  It was just that we were chosen because we have everybody on air and because it's been one of the biggest broadcasts for decades.
[02:32:47.351 --> 02:32:52.355]  And I'm very honored to be in that position, but we can also look at what they're afraid of, knowing that's the answer.
[02:32:52.675 --> 02:32:59.741]  Just like they'd have radar in World War II, or at least, you know, out in the aircraft, the British had it towards the end, their, you know,
[02:33:00.942 --> 02:33:03.785]  On their shoreline, but they had it during the Battle of Britain.
[02:33:03.805 --> 02:33:07.410]  The point is they didn't have it deployed, but they need to go where the flag was.
[02:33:07.730 --> 02:33:13.717]  When you're over the target, you're getting the flag and people have to understand you're going to lose everything if you're trying to keep everything.
[02:33:14.137 --> 02:33:16.680]  If people live in fear and are scared what the media is going to say,
[02:33:17.461 --> 02:33:20.482]  I mean, Trump's still like, wow, independent media is almost as big as mainstream.
[02:33:20.542 --> 02:33:21.903]  No, it's been way bigger for a long time.
[02:33:22.263 --> 02:33:23.623]  Stop caring what they say.
[02:33:23.783 --> 02:33:24.664]  Fully break with it.
[02:33:25.004 --> 02:33:27.305]  Look at how popular Trump is not caring about the system.
[02:33:27.485 --> 02:33:28.745]  Everybody has to adopt that.
[02:33:29.026 --> 02:33:31.606]  And I'm seeing something very exciting myself as a bellwether, as a test.
[02:33:32.707 --> 02:33:34.328]  All the big podcasts now want me on.
[02:33:34.708 --> 02:33:36.128]  All the Congress people will come on.
[02:33:36.308 --> 02:33:43.051]  All the big, you know, big pollsters, all will come on now because they realize it's cool to be a rebel in a time of evil when you're a rebel against tyranny.
[02:33:43.993 --> 02:33:45.274]  Yeah, you're exactly right.
[02:33:45.854 --> 02:33:49.656]  And the battleground of this current war is right here.
[02:33:49.777 --> 02:33:50.397]  It's in the mind.
[02:33:51.017 --> 02:33:52.678]  This is the battleground that they are targeting.
[02:33:53.018 --> 02:33:54.419]  It's all fifth-generation warfare.
[02:33:54.579 --> 02:33:57.221]  Jeffrey Prather talks about this, the PSYOPs.
[02:33:57.761 --> 02:34:00.963]  And by the way, this is why the government is attacking the church.
[02:34:01.784 --> 02:34:02.844]  Constantly attacking the church.
[02:34:03.004 --> 02:34:03.265]  Why?
[02:34:03.545 --> 02:34:03.765]  Why?
[02:34:04.125 --> 02:34:07.547]  Because faith makes you immune to fear.
[02:34:08.408 --> 02:34:10.209]  Fear is the control tool
[02:34:10.982 --> 02:34:18.250]  To push people into self-immolation through vaccine jabs, or giving up their power, giving up their rights through fear.
[02:34:18.611 --> 02:34:24.337]  If you have faith in God, you have nothing to fear, and you can't be controlled by the Satanists in the system.
[02:34:25.166 --> 02:34:26.388]  That's why they attacked the church.
[02:34:27.169 --> 02:34:40.625]  And also, Alex, I have been informed by various sources, attorneys and so on, that the FDA has launched a massive wave of assaults on small businesses and manufacturers like us.
[02:34:41.406 --> 02:34:41.707]  I don't know.
[02:35:03.488 --> 02:35:04.629]  This is the victory lap for America.
[02:35:04.649 --> 02:35:05.089]  I mean, RFK Jr.
[02:35:05.109 --> 02:35:09.132]  joining Trump is one of the most historic events that we will ever see in our lifetimes.
[02:35:33.147 --> 02:35:33.988]  And if RFK Jr.
[02:35:34.008 --> 02:35:47.098]  gets in as head of HHS, we are going to see such dramatic and positive reforms for this country that I dare say, Alex, please don't criticize me for saying this, but I think that RFK Jr.
[02:35:47.599 --> 02:35:52.022]  gives many people a much stronger reason to vote for Trump than Trump himself.
[02:35:52.042 --> 02:35:52.503]  I totally agree.
[02:35:53.564 --> 02:35:54.264]  Yeah, seriously.
[02:35:56.252 --> 02:35:58.874]  The FDA is at war with America.
[02:35:58.934 --> 02:36:01.336]  The CDC is at war with humanity.
[02:36:01.756 --> 02:36:08.381]  The NIH has been at war with the people, and they've waged science as a weapon of war against we, the people.
[02:36:08.882 --> 02:36:15.047]  Trump plus RFK can turn that around, and I don't agree with everything that Trump talks about.
[02:36:15.607 --> 02:36:18.249]  Not 100% alignment, but it's okay.
[02:36:18.809 --> 02:36:19.250]  It's okay.
[02:36:19.910 --> 02:36:20.671]  I'm voting for Trump.
[02:36:21.397 --> 02:36:22.318]  And RFK Jr.
[02:36:22.478 --> 02:36:29.202]  and JD Vance, we're going to get them into office, and then we're just going to have to deal with the war that the left is going to unleash against us.
[02:36:29.462 --> 02:36:29.942]  And you know what?
[02:36:30.322 --> 02:36:34.785]  With God on our side, and our preparedness, and our intelligence, and our dedication, we are ready.
[02:36:35.145 --> 02:36:40.128]  We are ready for that war with strength in our communities, strength with our local constitutional sheriffs.
[02:36:40.588 --> 02:36:44.951]  We can handle that attack, and we will push back the zombies to their blue cities.
[02:36:45.251 --> 02:36:48.673]  If they want to commit suicide in their own blue cities and take themselves out,
[02:36:49.233 --> 02:36:53.499]  That's their choice, but we're not going to let them take out the rural communities across this nation.
[02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:54.821]  Powerfully said.
[02:36:54.841 --> 02:37:06.316]  I mentioned this earlier, so in the few minutes we have left, Newsom's horrible anti-free speech law, Hillary saying arrest Trump supporters for their speech, that's pure desperation, but it's so naked.
[02:37:07.366 --> 02:37:08.947]  Massive incompetence, arrogance, pompousness.
[02:37:25.868 --> 02:37:33.095]  They are literally stupid people who never earned the power that they have usurped.
[02:37:33.596 --> 02:37:41.464]  In other words, when you have a DEI system, you don't have a meritocracy, so the most capable people don't rise to the positions of power.
[02:37:42.145 --> 02:37:48.970]  The only way that Kamala got to where she is today is because she was picked over other people who were far more qualified.
[02:37:49.530 --> 02:37:51.592]  She is not an intelligent person.
[02:37:52.172 --> 02:37:55.715]  Sadly, there's one or two members on the Supreme Court that were picked for the same reason.
[02:37:56.195 --> 02:37:57.576]  Literally, not that bright.
[02:37:58.377 --> 02:37:59.758]  But we can change this.
[02:37:59.918 --> 02:38:02.380]  We can change this peacefully at the ballot box.
[02:38:02.780 --> 02:38:04.982]  We can put America on a new course.
[02:38:05.242 --> 02:38:06.683]  It's not going to be an easy course.
[02:38:07.634 --> 02:38:11.458]  But it's the only option we have if we want to have a constitutional republic remaining at the end of this.
[02:38:18.536 --> 02:38:21.817]  Ford applied for patent to listen in and target ads in your car.
[02:38:21.857 --> 02:38:25.639]  Turns out for at least five years, they've been listening illegally to people and selling the data.
[02:38:25.659 --> 02:38:27.459]  We know phones have been doing that for 20 years at least.
[02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:28.940]  Surveillance on wheels.
[02:38:29.020 --> 02:38:32.201]  Ford patent to record conversations, display personalized advertising.
[02:38:32.641 --> 02:38:33.502]  Now they admit they do it.
[02:38:33.522 --> 02:38:34.522]  The FBI is investigating.
[02:38:34.542 --> 02:38:35.602]  Well, I mean, they're all doing it.
[02:38:36.463 --> 02:38:38.924]  Future Fords might detect speeding and report you to the cops.
[02:38:39.364 --> 02:38:40.164]  That's Fox News.
[02:38:40.684 --> 02:38:44.746]  Why do you think they're talking about Ford doing this now when this has been going on for decades?
[02:38:46.658 --> 02:38:54.921]  Well, Ford is a globalist corporation that has supported LGBT agendas and climate lunacy.
[02:38:54.941 --> 02:38:58.443]  I would never buy another Ford product again in my life.
[02:38:59.421 --> 02:39:01.902]  Although I had in the past, but forget Ford.
[02:39:02.902 --> 02:39:13.805]  And I also, look, can I give a shout out to Robbie Starbuck here because of the extraordinary work that he has been doing, exposing all the DEI agendas among these corporations, you know, originally, like Harley-Davidson and so on.
[02:39:15.325 --> 02:39:20.627]  Robbie Starbuck is a one-man wrecking crew for woke corporations.
[02:39:22.207 --> 02:39:27.389]  That man has done extraordinary work, and it just shows you the power of passion and dedication and truth.
[02:39:29.312 --> 02:39:31.314]  Everybody can do something like that that matters.
[02:39:31.955 --> 02:39:41.545]  And we, the people, we have to choose with our dollars what kinds of corporations we're going to support, what kinds of products we're going to support if we choose to buy them.
[02:39:42.086 --> 02:39:45.149]  And we've got to get all of these spy machines out of our lives.
[02:39:45.489 --> 02:39:47.672]  So never buy another Ford again.
[02:39:48.532 --> 02:39:54.994]  I don't like what John Deere did either, and Robbie Starbuck exposed John Deere with their culture war against America's farmers.
[02:39:55.594 --> 02:39:57.355]  I used to collect John Deere tractors.
[02:39:57.695 --> 02:39:59.935]  I will never buy another John Deere tractor again.
[02:40:00.055 --> 02:40:03.576]  That's right, and the good news is a lot of big corporations are backing off that agenda now.
[02:40:03.616 --> 02:40:05.637]  Of course, Anheuser-Busch is one of the biggest examples.
[02:40:05.697 --> 02:40:06.817]  We've got to punish them.
[02:40:07.558 --> 02:40:10.118]  Money, where we buy, what we do, it's all part of the fight.
[02:40:10.138 --> 02:40:11.999]  It's what they want, the whole social credit score.
[02:40:12.679 --> 02:40:14.140]  To totally dominate us and control us.
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:15.440]  Naturalnews.com.
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:18.001]  Mike, you've done a lot of great interviews, but this one was particularly powerful.
[02:40:18.341 --> 02:40:19.022]  It's live right now.
[02:40:19.042 --> 02:40:20.422]  We'll be posting it to X and everywhere else.
[02:40:20.682 --> 02:40:22.883]  Everybody, please share this like your future depends on it, because it does.
[02:40:23.243 --> 02:40:24.204]  Mike Adams, talk to you soon.
[02:40:24.224 --> 02:40:25.484]  You're going to be co-hosting some next week.
[02:40:26.184 --> 02:40:26.444]  All right.
[02:40:26.464 --> 02:40:26.965]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:40:26.985 --> 02:40:27.365]  God bless.
[02:40:27.685 --> 02:40:28.545]  There goes Mike Adams.
[02:40:28.565 --> 02:40:32.267]  He'll either be co-hosting with Owen a little bit Monday or Tuesday while I'm off with Tucker Carlson.
[02:40:33.746 --> 02:40:35.008]  It's an important event, so I'll be there.
[02:40:35.208 --> 02:40:36.429]  Okay.
[02:40:36.490 --> 02:40:39.513]  Jadar is always loaded for Baird, does a great job with the Global Stone documents.
[02:40:39.533 --> 02:40:40.475]  That's coming up next hour.
[02:40:40.515 --> 02:40:43.418]  Then Owen Schroer in about an hour and five minutes with the War Room 3 p.m.
[02:40:43.438 --> 02:40:43.779]  Central.
[02:40:44.580 --> 02:40:47.704]  Talking about supplements, we need the funds, plus their great products.
[02:40:47.724 --> 02:40:50.487]  95% Humanoid, two different brands, both have 95%...
[02:40:51.288 --> 02:40:51.729]  We're good to go.
[02:41:06.479 --> 02:41:10.021]  Curcuminoid at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.

[02:41:14.743 --> 02:41:16.364]  That's all still discounted, though it's selling out.

[02:41:49.548 --> 02:41:55.249]  They're all still in stock and discounted at drjonesnaturals.com, but they're selling out.

[02:42:02.690 --> 02:42:03.610]  We need your support.
[02:42:03.650 --> 02:42:04.511]  Plus, they're great products.

[02:42:47.720 --> 02:42:51.362]  We are in the critical part of the battle right now, and we need your support.
[02:42:51.402 --> 02:42:52.202]  Plus, these are great products.
[02:42:52.242 --> 02:42:53.042]  Take action now.
[02:42:53.382 --> 02:42:55.083]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:42:55.143 --> 02:42:56.243]  Jay Dyer, straight ahead.
[02:42:57.524 --> 02:43:00.225]  I'm asking viewers to just sit back for a moment.
[02:43:01.252 --> 02:43:04.595]  And really think about the success InfoWars has had.
[02:43:05.156 --> 02:43:08.459]  And InfoWars isn't just me, it's not just the crew, it's not just our guests.
[02:43:09.420 --> 02:43:14.705]  It's all of you, the viewers and listeners that give us intel, that spread the word, that support the broadcast.
[02:43:15.426 --> 02:43:19.470]  In the 30-year history of me being on air and 27 years of InfoWars,
[02:43:20.050 --> 02:43:25.712]  We have changed the world, and because we researched the globalist-owned documents, we knew their game plan.
[02:43:25.832 --> 02:43:29.093]  I didn't learn all this stuff out of some Palantir crystal ball.
[02:43:29.213 --> 02:43:42.937]  I did it by reading the books and publications that these creatures put out, because they communicate with each other and are very honest about their diabolical plan for world government, depopulation, transhumanism, total robot control.
[02:43:43.477 --> 02:43:45.058]  And I believe in humanity.
[02:43:45.559 --> 02:43:50.943]  I bet on you because I was betting on myself and I know that it's always darkest right before the dawn.
[02:43:51.724 --> 02:44:04.694]  And so now in 2024, so close to this election, it is more critical than ever to not just keep InfoWars on the air, but to not take the reports and the videos and the articles and the interviews and to get those out to everybody you know.
[02:44:05.335 --> 02:44:06.596]  I understand that's really stating the
[02:44:06.596 --> 02:44:07.097]  We're good to go.
[02:44:24.819 --> 02:44:30.884]  Now, a critical part of InfoWars continuing on, and hopefully even expanding into the future, is your support.
[02:44:30.944 --> 02:44:32.205]  And we make it so easy.
[02:44:32.585 --> 02:44:39.751]  We bring you the very best products that are out there that will empower and enrich your life at very competitive, affordable prices.
[02:44:40.351 --> 02:44:41.792]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:41.852 --> 02:44:47.016]  Read the five-star reviews for the great InfoWars MD line and the other great supplements as well.
[02:44:47.316 --> 02:44:48.357]  They really are incredible.
[02:44:48.517 --> 02:44:53.381]  They're the very best that the supplement industry has to offer, and they really work.
[02:44:53.681 --> 02:44:54.402]  That's why people
[02:44:54.502 --> 02:44:54.802]  Love them.
[02:44:55.042 --> 02:45:04.150]  The fastest growing industry in the United States other than AI is supplements year after year for 30 years because people are seeing the incredible effects.
[02:45:04.511 --> 02:45:09.875]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, there are more than 15 products under the InfoWars MD line, and they're all amazing.
[02:45:10.115 --> 02:45:11.717]  But some of my favorites are
[02:45:12.037 --> 02:45:20.344]  The Nitric Boost that cleans out the blood, the cardiovascular system, and has a lot of great side effects that men will particularly notice.
[02:45:20.725 --> 02:45:22.026]  You need to check it out for yourself.
[02:45:22.066 --> 02:45:25.168]  You hear the callers talking about it all the time without me even prompting them.
[02:45:25.529 --> 02:45:26.570]  It is amazing.
[02:45:26.910 --> 02:45:30.893]  Then you've got Joint Relief Max that is a natural pain reliever.
[02:45:30.954 --> 02:45:32.915]  Works really, really well in a healthy way.
[02:45:32.935 --> 02:45:33.796]  You have turmeric 95, 95% curcuminoid.
[02:45:36.118 --> 02:45:38.980]  This is where we get the Turmeric for Bodies Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:40.320]  They're both excellent.
[02:45:40.420 --> 02:45:41.341]  Info Wars MD.
[02:45:41.701 --> 02:45:45.703]  We've got the full spectrum CBD gummies.
[02:45:45.924 --> 02:45:46.464]  25 milligrams.
[02:45:46.564 --> 02:45:47.845]  Great anti-inflammatory.
[02:45:48.165 --> 02:45:52.567]  Isn't a downer, isn't a depressant, but makes you very relaxed and focused.
[02:45:52.627 --> 02:45:55.089]  It's almost like a stimulant in a weird way, but...
[02:45:55.769 --> 02:45:56.250]  It's different.
[02:45:56.630 --> 02:45:59.433]  And then, of course, we've got other great products for women and men.
[02:45:59.533 --> 02:46:00.455]  Ageless Vitality.
[02:46:00.675 --> 02:46:02.217]  Just high-quality collagen.
[02:46:02.597 --> 02:46:04.259]  All of this funds our operation.
[02:46:04.279 --> 02:46:06.421]  And, of course, these are 25 milligram gummies.
[02:46:06.441 --> 02:46:06.942]  They work great.
[02:46:07.302 --> 02:46:10.005]  We have 1,000 milligram tincture.
[02:46:10.966 --> 02:46:16.190]  That is made by one of the top manufacturers in the country who sells it at retail for twice the price.
[02:46:16.450 --> 02:46:17.691]  We sell it, then they discount it.
[02:46:17.992 --> 02:46:22.995]  Even at the discount, we're selling it for about 50% less than the actual manufacturer does.
[02:46:23.236 --> 02:46:25.597]  There's not as much profit, but it's a great deal.
[02:46:26.318 --> 02:46:30.201]  1,000 milligrams CBD oil, InfoWars MD, that's the tincture.
[02:46:30.461 --> 02:46:35.164]  Then we've got all these other amazing products from InfoWars MD as well.
[02:46:35.945 --> 02:46:38.166]  They're excellent, and it funds the operation.
[02:46:38.186 --> 02:46:43.287]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com today and check out the InfoWars MD line.
[02:46:43.547 --> 02:46:47.889]  While you're at it, get a high-quality water filtration, get storable food, get books, get films, get t-shirts.
[02:46:48.109 --> 02:46:51.030]  All of it will enrich your life, inform your mind, and keep us on the air.
[02:46:51.230 --> 02:46:52.130]  That's critical right now.
[02:46:52.450 --> 02:46:53.890]  I humbly thank you for your support.
[02:46:54.171 --> 02:46:55.431]  Now please go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:47:03.370 --> 02:47:06.592]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:23.880 --> 02:47:30.346]  How are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump?
[02:47:30.806 --> 02:47:49.302]  Even if we were to have a resounding blue wave come through, as many of us would like, putting it all back together again after we've gone through this MAGA nightmare, and re-educating basically, which that sounds like a rather
[02:47:51.716 --> 02:47:52.997]  A re-education camp.
[02:47:53.157 --> 02:47:54.978]  I don't think we really want to call it that.
[02:47:55.338 --> 02:47:59.261]  Newsom has signed three anti-free speech bills yesterday.
[02:47:59.281 --> 02:48:15.451]  One of them says if prosecutors decide, in their own opinion, that you were trying to deceive with a deep fake, and they use examples of things that are clearly jokes, that you will face many years in prison after they've signed laws
[02:48:16.795 --> 02:48:20.640]  That if you rape a child as young as 12, you get two days in county jail.
[02:48:20.660 --> 02:48:22.141]  What's up, guys?
[02:48:22.422 --> 02:48:25.966]  It's your lovin' Govan, here to drop some nah about Prop 83.
[02:48:26.907 --> 02:48:33.635]  Prop 83 is a spending bill designed to make new investments in a freakin' butt-ton of underfunded sectors in our great state.
[02:48:34.096 --> 02:48:35.758]  Like renewable energy.
[02:48:36.883 --> 02:48:39.748]  Kali leads the nation in solar power, which is rad.
[02:48:40.208 --> 02:48:41.390]  But what about lunar power?
[02:48:42.131 --> 02:48:46.618]  I believe the moon is capable of so much more than just controlling your Aunt Diane's ovulation cycle.
[02:48:46.858 --> 02:48:48.040]  Ooh, take it, take it, take it, take it.
[02:48:48.841 --> 02:48:49.302]  Thank you.
[02:48:50.063 --> 02:48:51.465]  Let's put the moon to work for us.
[02:48:52.026 --> 02:48:55.247]  You know we crush it when it comes to whatever bra, drug laws.
[02:48:55.647 --> 02:49:03.209]  But Prop 83 hits different, allowing Californians to keep up to seven ounces of hallucinogenic toad venom for personal use.
[02:49:03.649 --> 02:49:09.751]  Plus, two gallons of synthetic peyote and rando Guatemalan lab s*** bought with crypto off the dark web.
[02:49:13.824 --> 02:49:17.506]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, anybody can tell when something is AI.
[02:49:18.186 --> 02:49:21.788]  It can instantly, if people are confused, they can find the actual clip.
[02:49:23.149 --> 02:49:25.850]  They just want another way to convince everybody to go after free speech.
[02:49:26.250 --> 02:49:28.852]  And that ties into Hillary saying arrest people for disinformation.
[02:49:29.565 --> 02:49:41.174]  The UN and WHO have announced, along with the WEF, massive plans to start criminally charging people, which is already happening all over Europe and Australia, for their speech in Canada.
[02:49:41.734 --> 02:49:47.699]  That is a huge, vital stack, as the system goes, openly, nakedly, Communist Chinese style.
[02:49:47.759 --> 02:49:54.622]  There has to be a responsibility that is placed on these social media sites to understand their power.
[02:49:55.342 --> 02:50:03.925]  They are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level of oversight or regulation.
[02:50:04.165 --> 02:50:05.186]  And that has to stop.
[02:50:05.646 --> 02:50:12.374]  But I also think there are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda.
[02:50:13.375 --> 02:50:21.924]  And whether they should be civilly or even in some cases criminally charged is something that would be a better deterrence.
[02:50:21.984 --> 02:50:25.188]  I don't feel at home with people who believe in censorship.
[02:50:25.248 --> 02:50:26.770]  I think it's disqualifying.
[02:50:32.706 --> 02:50:36.827]  It's antithetical and inconsistent with democracy.
[02:50:38.048 --> 02:50:46.911]  And we had Hillary Clinton yesterday making this extraordinary statement endorsing
[02:50:48.041 --> 02:50:50.984]  Endorsing this censorship of speech in our country.
[02:50:51.024 --> 02:50:54.306]  We have Kamala Harris saying that free speech is a privilege.
[02:50:54.426 --> 02:50:55.187]  It's not a right.
[02:50:55.207 --> 02:50:58.870]  And Tim Walz saying the same thing.
[02:50:59.831 --> 02:51:05.135]  And I think that that is disqualifying for anybody who wants to be President of the United States.
[02:51:07.133 --> 02:51:08.815]  They've been brainwashed, Joy.
[02:51:08.895 --> 02:51:13.599]  I really believe that they have been brainwashed by this misinformation campaign.
[02:51:13.739 --> 02:51:16.882]  So how do you de-radicalize these people?
[02:51:17.503 --> 02:51:24.550]  Once we educate them, we coach them on how to interact and empower the person to start thinking for themselves.
[02:51:24.950 --> 02:51:27.072]  I think a lot of people are going to have to be deprogrammed.
[02:51:27.092 --> 02:51:32.617]  We had a program addressing white supremacists.
[02:51:32.997 --> 02:51:41.585]  We had programs, federal programs, that went towards funding organizations like these that deradicalized people.
[02:51:42.385 --> 02:51:44.968]  And President Trump pulled the plug.
[02:51:45.128 --> 02:51:48.691]  I mean, this is, on a scale of censorship, it's very high.
[02:51:48.731 --> 02:51:49.432]  I mean, this is just
[02:51:50.467 --> 02:51:50.907]  Wild.
[02:51:51.047 --> 02:51:54.430]  But I mean, when you're smuggling 325,000 admitted missing kids.
[02:51:54.750 --> 02:51:56.251]  Welcome to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:56.271 --> 02:51:57.592]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[02:51:57.612 --> 02:51:58.352]  I'm Jason Allison.
[02:51:58.372 --> 02:52:02.214]  We're going to be talking about the Diddy revelations.
[02:52:02.815 --> 02:52:12.761]  If you remember, we talked about this about seven months ago at length, multiple podcasts, multiple fourth hour Alex Jones installments where I covered
[02:52:13.604 --> 02:52:22.506]  What was mounting to be a pretty epic breakdown to show that really pop music, especially the rap genre, it's all fake and gay.
[02:52:23.086 --> 02:52:25.086]  We've been saying it was fake and gay for a long time.
[02:52:25.126 --> 02:52:27.306]  That was considered to be a pretty wild conspiracy theory.
[02:52:27.346 --> 02:52:42.069]  But if you remember some years back, maybe 10 years ago, and Alex reported on this at the time, it had come out in various leaked business meeting transcripts and stories that the founders of MTV had actually helped to craft
[02:52:42.924 --> 02:52:55.571]  The notion of gangster rap and that you could have this kind of thuggish lifestyle as a social engineered package deal to sell not just to black kids but also to white kids and then to sell it
[02:52:56.466 --> 02:52:59.467]  As an aesthetic, as a way of life to the whole world.
[02:52:59.787 --> 02:53:04.288]  And now you can see that some form of hip-hop and rap has really been adopted all over the world.
[02:53:04.328 --> 02:53:26.112]  I'm not saying that the music style itself is anything bad or evil, but the whole engineering project of selling people on a drug-based lifestyle, drug-selling lifestyle, all of that, glamorizing it, kind of in the vein of the way that Hollywood prior to that had glamorized the idea of organized crime and the mafia lifestyle.
[02:53:26.832 --> 02:53:29.474]  So we have evidence of that.
[02:53:29.675 --> 02:53:36.461]  I think Alex has mentioned people like Sunder Redstone and others who were really at the heart of this idea.
[02:53:36.481 --> 02:53:44.268]  We have also the story of people like Rick Ross, Freeway Ricky Ross, who, not Rick Ross the rapper, I think he's named after Freeway Ricky Ross, but
[02:53:44.728 --> 02:54:03.174]  You know, he discussed how high-level intelligence operatives and agencies were behind the importation of crack cocaine and essentially the whole coke importation of the 1980s, especially, was directly connected to key members of the intelligence apparatus and operatives of the CIA.
[02:54:03.214 --> 02:54:07.555]  People like Barry Seale, who was flying it in if you've seen the Tom Cruise movie American Made.
[02:54:08.336 --> 02:54:11.597]  You can think back to situations like Mino, Arkansas.
[02:54:11.637 --> 02:54:12.317]  You can think about
[02:54:13.418 --> 02:54:17.724]  Uh, the reporter, Gary Webb, who was suicided over this.
[02:54:18.225 --> 02:54:22.152]  And so you'll notice their key connection to Arkansas on the time of the Clintons.
[02:54:22.873 --> 02:54:26.038]  That's going to be relevant because the Democratic Party plays a key role in this.
[02:54:26.098 --> 02:54:27.881]  Of course, I'm not saying it's only a Democratic thing.
[02:54:28.522 --> 02:54:39.271]  Many of the Republican establishment obviously have also been part of this longtime Deep State Uniparty, which has always been attached at the hip to the pop culture music arena.
[02:54:39.331 --> 02:54:40.812]  They've always had this overlap.
[02:54:41.412 --> 02:54:47.217]  And this last week I did a pretty in-depth interview with Sammy the Bull Gravano on my YouTube channel.
[02:54:47.237 --> 02:54:48.098]  You can go watch that.
[02:54:48.618 --> 02:54:50.399]  And he's the most famous living gangster.
[02:54:50.860 --> 02:54:52.161]  He's the most famous living hitman.
[02:54:52.921 --> 02:54:54.463]  He was John Gotti's underboss.
[02:54:55.283 --> 02:54:57.305]  We had a long discussion about his life.
[02:54:58.052 --> 02:55:01.173]  And again, he sort of also backs this up from his perspective.
[02:55:01.213 --> 02:55:07.654]  Of course, there's always been this overlap between organized crime and the music industry, organized crime and intelligence agencies.
[02:55:08.174 --> 02:55:10.774]  Think back to situations like Operation Underground.
[02:55:11.314 --> 02:55:22.356]  This is where the mafia was recruited back at World War II and even prior to that to utilize the drug networks to fund black operations that the mafia controlled.
[02:55:22.377 --> 02:55:24.757]  The Sicilian mafia had control of a lot of opium lanes.
[02:55:25.297 --> 02:55:28.820]  It's not just a Sicilian mafia, obviously other mafias had a role in this as well.
[02:55:29.481 --> 02:55:31.082]  Other intelligence agencies had a role in this.
[02:55:31.122 --> 02:55:36.427]  The French had a role in these various drug lanes, Golden Triangle and all that.
[02:55:38.529 --> 02:55:48.979]  But what's unique, I think, about the music realm is that it's really collapsing and it's being exposed as identical to the other scams.
[02:55:49.539 --> 02:55:50.340]  So if you think about it,
[02:55:51.007 --> 02:55:54.349]  You might think of all these domains and all these areas as disconnected.
[02:55:54.389 --> 02:56:03.093]  You might think, well, over here is the secret societies and their occult networks and how they operate with mind control or whatever.
[02:56:03.233 --> 02:56:18.520]  And then over here, you've got the intelligence agencies and they operate over here in this domain with their, you know, with their aspects of black ops and, you know, off the books funding and assassinations or whatever we typically think of, you know,
[02:56:18.925 --> 02:56:21.107]  Intelligence is doing James Bond type stuff.
[02:56:21.647 --> 02:56:26.451]  And then there's government over here with their public elected officials, supposedly, and their corruption.
[02:56:27.352 --> 02:56:33.417]  And really, you know, and then there's music industry over here and Hollywood, and they're doing their, you know, degenerate party things.
[02:56:33.697 --> 02:56:36.880]  But really, a lot of these elements at the top overlap.
[02:56:37.781 --> 02:56:42.665]  And so it's not that there's necessarily one gigantic massive conspiracy where everyone's in on it.
[02:56:43.411 --> 02:57:08.938]  I was watching clips of Matt Walsh this week when he was debating with Joe Rogan on a recent appearance where they were discussing various large-scale conspiracies and Matt Walsh with this typical sort of normie perspective and I guess the daily wired mandates you can't believe in anything conspiratorial even though we've seen the last four years one of the biggest gigantic coordinated global conspiracies in everyone's face namely the COVID nonsense that they tried to foist upon the whole world.
[02:57:10.516 --> 02:57:18.122]  No, you have to believe that it's really impossible because there couldn't be large scale conspiracies because it requires everyone being in on it.
[02:57:18.142 --> 02:57:22.306]  Well, if you think about the Manhattan Project, the information was compartmentalized.
[02:57:22.426 --> 02:57:26.990]  Not everyone was in on the totality of what the pieces and the parts that they were making.
[02:57:27.617 --> 02:57:28.098]  fit into.
[02:57:28.118 --> 02:57:29.319]  They didn't know they were making a bomb.
[02:57:29.339 --> 02:57:37.467]  They didn't know what this gigantic TVA project was that helped to, you know, fund and give the energy to the Manhattan Project out of Tennessee.
[02:57:37.887 --> 02:57:39.288]  They didn't know what all this was about.
[02:57:39.308 --> 02:57:42.872]  They only knew their little compartmentalized piecemeal operation.
[02:57:43.846 --> 02:57:47.448]  And so likewise, the structure of military works this way.
[02:57:47.948 --> 02:57:50.110]  The structure of intelligence agencies works this way.
[02:57:50.210 --> 02:57:51.090]  Need to know basis.
[02:57:51.250 --> 02:57:56.213]  That's why they have clearance and all that for more detailed information that you don't have access to.
[02:57:56.833 --> 02:58:01.376]  The secret societies operate on the same tiered basis of need to know.
[02:58:02.037 --> 02:58:03.077]  You're compartmentalized.
[02:58:03.097 --> 02:58:09.640]  For example, Albert Pike in Morals and Dogma says that the lower degrees are not told the secrets of the higher degrees of masonry.
[02:58:10.220 --> 02:58:15.122]  So all secret societies, all groups, all mafia organizations, guess what?
[02:58:15.202 --> 02:58:16.342]  They're based the same way too.
[02:58:16.762 --> 02:58:18.383]  It's a cell structure with tiers.
[02:58:19.605 --> 02:58:23.187]  Everybody would have to be in on it or else they couldn't do it.
[02:58:38.042 --> 02:58:40.443]  Again, this is basic military stuff.
[02:58:40.523 --> 02:58:46.645]  I'm not a military historian, but I've read several military historians who talk about, of course, you compartmentalize the information.
[02:58:46.665 --> 02:58:50.166]  You don't tell everybody in the army what the secret plans are.
[02:58:50.206 --> 02:58:50.967]  This would be foolish.
[02:58:51.427 --> 02:58:56.168]  So likewise, the government and the military is structured on the basis of compartmentalized information.
[02:58:56.629 --> 02:59:04.291]  So this idea that no conspiracies on a large scale are possible because everyone would have to know it or that it would come out is not true.
[02:59:04.331 --> 02:59:05.892]  And by the way, eventually,
[02:59:06.585 --> 02:59:10.806]  Information does come out and large-scale conspiracies do get exposed.
[02:59:11.086 --> 02:59:15.347]  For example, it is declassified and no one doubts anymore Operation Northwoods.
[02:59:15.948 --> 02:59:24.530]  That was one example of a document where a large-scale conspiracy was being planned and it's universally admitted as a declassified valid document nowadays.
[02:59:24.590 --> 02:59:32.432]  It included false flags, it included staged newscasts to blame the event on the Cubans, Castro, etc.
[02:59:33.715 --> 02:59:41.839]  It included commandeered radio-controlled drones or jets or planes, staged bodies in the plane if it crashed, etc.
[02:59:42.179 --> 02:59:48.102]  All of this stagecraft, for example, in the case of Northwoods, is admitted and undeniable.
[02:59:49.383 --> 02:59:52.144]  Many other instances in history have been admitted to false flags.
[02:59:52.165 --> 03:00:02.730]  We've done entire fourth hours of Alex Jones, where the world's various intelligence agencies and governments have given at least 42-plus examples of admitted
[03:00:03.581 --> 03:00:13.523]  False flag operations, again, from government and intelligence sources, Turkish intelligence, Israeli intelligence, Lebanese intelligence that are admitting we believe this event was a false flag.
[03:00:13.543 --> 03:00:18.524]  But now remember, in the mindset of the normie conservative world, that still doesn't exist.
[03:00:18.564 --> 03:00:19.464]  It's not a thing.
[03:00:20.224 --> 03:00:28.606]  That's the realm of conspiracy people, even though everybody who's been in the military for any amount of time or who studies military history knows there's such things as false flags.
[03:00:28.646 --> 03:00:33.267]  In fact, most wars begin with false flag operations, like the Gulf of Tonkin.
[03:00:34.708 --> 03:00:44.114]  And even more recent conflicts, like the Maidan coup, that began with a black ops sniper operation, which set off a coup, set off a riot.
[03:00:45.415 --> 03:00:48.397]  So even in present day situations, we know that this is going on.
[03:00:48.497 --> 03:00:52.880]  We know that militaries lie on a large scale on any side of a conflict.
[03:00:53.581 --> 03:00:58.784]  So the idea of people like Matt Walsh or people at the Daily Wire who believe that there's no such thing as conspiracies.
[03:00:58.804 --> 03:00:59.965]  You shouldn't talk about that.
[03:01:00.025 --> 03:01:00.846]  It doesn't exist.
[03:01:00.906 --> 03:01:01.886]  It's crazy.
[03:01:02.387 --> 03:01:04.148]  It's just simply historically false.
[03:01:05.706 --> 03:01:12.990]  Now, to go to the music industry again and to Hollywood, this is something that I've focused on in my graduate work.
[03:01:13.591 --> 03:01:15.872]  A lot of people think that it would be schizo.
[03:01:15.892 --> 03:01:28.459]  It sounds crazy to think that there could be an overlap between people in Hollywood or the music industry and operations relating to the FBI or to the CIA or to compromise at a high level.
[03:01:29.240 --> 03:01:31.621]  And yet, what did we lecture through pretty recently?
[03:01:32.482 --> 03:01:34.723]  I did a whole fourth hour here on this topic of
[03:01:35.672 --> 03:01:38.173]  The vast history of sexpionage.
[03:01:38.593 --> 03:01:40.913]  This is a classic mainline history book.
[03:01:40.933 --> 03:01:41.954]  This is not a conspiracy book.
[03:01:41.974 --> 03:01:46.195]  This is a mainline history book on the history of sexual espionage.
[03:01:46.855 --> 03:01:50.036]  And what we saw there was that this is not an exception in history.
[03:01:50.556 --> 03:01:52.936]  This is the norm in history.
[03:01:52.996 --> 03:02:03.139]  In fact, we saw multiple cases like the Russo-Japanese War, where sexual compromise played a key role in deciding the winners of the conflict.
[03:02:04.108 --> 03:02:07.650]  Other military campaigns and operations have also been decided in history.
[03:02:07.730 --> 03:02:14.653]  In fact, some of the World War II victories were determined on the basis of intel gathered from brothels.
[03:02:17.514 --> 03:02:29.439]  Churchill commandeered certain brothels where he got information on German generals through the brothels and through the pillow talk secrets that were leaked at that time.
[03:02:30.094 --> 03:02:35.317]  So if this is the norm in history and warfare, why are we still acting in the media and especially an alternative?
[03:02:35.417 --> 03:02:40.640]  I understand why mainstream media acts like none of this exists, because they are completely controlled.
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:42.881]  They're there to lie and prop up the system.
[03:02:43.241 --> 03:02:53.447]  But to have all of the so-called alternative conservative media still acting like the neocon normie conservative media of 20 years ago is mind-boggling to me.
[03:02:54.469 --> 03:03:02.193]  Now, as all of these cases come out, imagine after Epstein, and now after the new Epstein, Diddy, he's basically Black Epstein.
[03:03:02.834 --> 03:03:03.534]  He's Blackstein.
[03:03:04.675 --> 03:03:10.338]  How are we not admitting that this is what really goes on at the levels of the power elite?
[03:03:10.858 --> 03:03:12.979]  Why are we still buying into the Normie narrative?
[03:03:14.740 --> 03:03:21.404]  If we look at the history of P. Diddy, for example, we're going to see that the structure, it appears, this is what we said seven months ago.
[03:03:22.404 --> 03:03:28.066]  And it's not necessarily confirmed yet, but it looks like that's where it's going, and that's what seems to be the case in these arrests.
[03:03:28.386 --> 03:03:37.868]  It seems to be tied to a lot higher-level criminal actions and criminal activities that do involve high-level government and intelligence operatives.
[03:03:39.149 --> 03:03:40.209]  But this is nothing new.
[03:03:40.849 --> 03:03:44.650]  Think back to the most famous Satanist of the last century, Aleister Crowley.
[03:03:45.362 --> 03:03:46.843]  Dr. Richard Spence has a book.
[03:03:46.883 --> 03:03:49.045]  We've interviewed him on this book, Secret Agent 666.
[03:03:49.625 --> 03:03:52.567]  He knows how Crowley was brought into British intelligence.
[03:03:53.288 --> 03:03:56.990]  He was involved in putting out propaganda for British intelligence.
[03:03:57.210 --> 03:04:06.677]  He was involved in various operations, including the operation to get Rudolf Hess to fly into Scotland, because Hess listened to occultists and esotericists, right?
[03:04:06.697 --> 03:04:08.438]  So this helped determine that conflict as well.
[03:04:10.154 --> 03:04:11.215]  And Crowley's not the only one.
[03:04:11.275 --> 03:04:15.516]  It looks like people like Madame Blavatsky were also in some way intelligence operatives or spies.
[03:04:15.536 --> 03:04:17.797]  So these are the top occultists of the last century.
[03:04:17.837 --> 03:04:31.043]  They just happen to have high-level connections to espionage and it looks as if Blavatsky, at least most people, scholars today, we covered this when we did the Cambridge Companion the other day, it's believed, scholars believe that she was a spy.
[03:04:32.805 --> 03:04:37.248]  If we think about even the religious realm, it's not any different there either.
[03:04:37.388 --> 03:04:44.873]  We're noticing the same patterns, the same structures of how these scams, how these compromise operations, how these Ponzi schemes are structured.
[03:04:45.313 --> 03:04:48.215]  It's no different than it is in things like Gladio.
[03:04:48.255 --> 03:04:58.702]  Remember in Operation Gladio, we saw that the entire Italian government, including the Cardinals and the Church of Rome during the Gladio Cold War operations, many of them had been compromised.
[03:04:59.142 --> 03:05:09.654]  They were on the CIA's payroll and take because they had been to Bunga Bunga parties where they participated in occult ritual orgies that were very much Eyes Wide Shut style stuff.
[03:05:10.695 --> 03:05:18.984]  And so they were on board totally with what Licio Gelli and other members of the organized crime structure
[03:05:20.126 --> 03:05:20.146]  I
[03:05:40.543 --> 03:05:41.003]  Puff Daddy.
[03:05:41.043 --> 03:05:41.863]  I still call him Puff Daddy.
[03:05:41.883 --> 03:05:43.604]  I don't know if it's P. Diddy.
[03:05:43.624 --> 03:05:46.644]  Puff Daddy had 1,000 bottles of Johnson & Johnson, which itself is gross.
[03:05:46.684 --> 03:05:51.845]  I mean, it's not just a bunch of petroleum seed oil stuff, but it's just beyond that.
[03:05:51.865 --> 03:05:52.305]  1,000 bottles?
[03:05:52.485 --> 03:05:53.885]  How many people are coming to these parties?
[03:05:54.365 --> 03:06:08.728]  And essentially, to be recruited into the rap world required this initiatory process, this humiliation and compromise operation where you would be filmed doing all kinds of gay sex acts or other types of stuff.
[03:06:09.722 --> 03:06:19.745]  That is now, again, coming out in multiple people's accusations, and this has led to the arrest, and Diddy's being charged with things like human sex trafficking and so forth.
[03:06:20.385 --> 03:06:23.806]  So, you'll notice these patterns here.
[03:06:23.866 --> 03:06:25.306]  What does this look just like?
[03:06:25.767 --> 03:06:27.667]  It looks a lot like the Epstein model, doesn't it?
[03:06:28.467 --> 03:06:30.708]  Now, I don't know if there's a direct connection between P. Diddy and Epstein.
[03:06:30.748 --> 03:06:38.130]  There could be, but if you read Whitney Webb's book on Epstein, the volume two of her blackmail book, she does make a lot of connections between
[03:06:38.932 --> 03:06:48.816]  The people like Diddy, people like in the black organized crime structure that's out there, that they have obviously a deep, deep connection to the DNC.
[03:06:49.156 --> 03:06:55.339]  They have deep, deep longtime connections to the Clinton operation, to people like Oprah.
[03:06:55.739 --> 03:06:57.099]  Think back to John of God.
[03:06:57.159 --> 03:07:03.662]  Again, other human trafficking cult operations like John of God, the cult that was engaged in human trafficking.
[03:07:04.282 --> 03:07:11.967]  Also, heavily promoted by Oprah to all the wine moms and the Oprah moms out there in America.
[03:07:12.607 --> 03:07:14.708]  Now, oh, it turns out he's a human trafficker.
[03:07:14.768 --> 03:07:16.269]  Oh, well, it turns out there's another one.
[03:07:16.770 --> 03:07:24.274]  So this structure of especially more so the Democratic Party, I mean, I think there's plenty of corrupt rhino people too.
[03:07:24.334 --> 03:07:28.016]  So I'm not excluding the Republican fraud establishment either.
[03:07:28.737 --> 03:07:32.619]  But this seems to be really the Democrats that are the most locked into Hollywood.
[03:07:33.584 --> 03:07:33.904]  All right.
[03:07:49.884 --> 03:07:51.445]  Spirit cooking style operations.
[03:07:51.485 --> 03:07:54.946]  Think about Marina Abramovich and her spheres, right?
[03:07:54.966 --> 03:08:03.550]  She's training Lady Gaga to do this, these Krolian style rituals and putting your magical intentionality into your performance art and all this.
[03:08:04.110 --> 03:08:08.773]  Again, very consciously, explicitly Krolian and occultic stuff.
[03:08:08.873 --> 03:08:10.473]  Now, again, remember, this doesn't exist.
[03:08:10.633 --> 03:08:12.914]  We're told still by the mainstream media, this all made up.
[03:08:13.635 --> 03:08:13.935]  What is it?
[03:08:13.975 --> 03:08:14.695]  Atlantic Magazine?
[03:08:14.715 --> 03:08:17.777]  There's no such thing as Epstein and child trafficking.
[03:08:17.817 --> 03:08:18.537]  It's all made up.
[03:08:19.335 --> 03:08:25.601]  And they'll say that because they'll put out fake stories of people going to the extreme, the QAnon nonsense.
[03:08:26.082 --> 03:08:28.324]  And so they'll say, look, here's what these people believe.
[03:08:28.364 --> 03:08:29.365]  Therefore, it's not true.
[03:08:29.665 --> 03:08:33.830]  Well, that stuff's put out on purpose to make people talking about it seem absurd.
[03:08:34.530 --> 03:08:35.191]  But it is real.
[03:08:35.451 --> 03:08:37.113]  There's absolutely human trafficking.
[03:08:37.648 --> 03:08:39.030]  There's absolutely all this stuff going on.
[03:08:39.110 --> 03:08:52.304]  Alex has been down to the border and documented it in the last couple of years with the completely open borders and the various NGOs and foundations that are supported and are down there running this stuff, right?
[03:08:52.424 --> 03:08:53.505]  Israeli connected NGOs.
[03:08:54.548 --> 03:09:03.032]  Soros connected, Roman Catholic connected NGOs, all working together to do this mass importation and connected to, guess what?
[03:09:03.612 --> 03:09:07.554]  Similar style operations to Boys Town and the Franklin cover-up.
[03:09:08.114 --> 03:09:09.375]  Look into the Franklin cover-up.
[03:09:09.675 --> 03:09:14.917]  You'll see that Boys Town, the largest Catholic organization at that time, I don't know if it still is, for orphans and so forth.
[03:09:15.342 --> 03:09:29.208]  Oh, actually turns out it's a human trafficking cover, and that they're trafficking boys to the White House, Republicans at that time, to be engaged in all kinds of sex acts, which were also Epstein-style compromise operations.
[03:09:29.268 --> 03:09:36.832]  Craig Spence, the lobbyist, was at that time compromising people through cameras behind mirrors, all the same stuff that you would expect.
[03:09:37.532 --> 03:09:38.032]  Oh, guess what?
[03:09:38.112 --> 03:09:41.914]  Turns out Diddy has cameras in every room to compromise people.
[03:09:42.734 --> 03:09:44.135]  Now, Diddy didn't think this up.
[03:09:44.950 --> 03:09:52.798]  All right, he didn't come up with all this because he's some sort of like mega mogul rap genius, you know, Blofeld character.
[03:09:52.858 --> 03:10:01.046]  No, he at some point was probably brought into a co-op that I know he's had a series of arrests and so forth and investigations back in the day.
[03:10:01.367 --> 03:10:04.350]  And if we look into his history, it's a pretty wild history.
[03:10:05.511 --> 03:10:06.151]  Diddy was
[03:10:07.418 --> 03:10:11.461]  Raised in a family who his father was very close to the black gangster Frank Lucas.
[03:10:12.061 --> 03:10:17.144]  So he always kind of had a pretty close connection to black organized crime groups.
[03:10:18.585 --> 03:10:20.767]  I believe his dad ended up dead.
[03:10:21.767 --> 03:10:26.851]  And then his mom took him to try to get out of that lifestyle and they fled to the suburbs.
[03:10:27.711 --> 03:10:35.156]  At some point he ended up close to the figure of Clive Davis, who's a famous rap or mogul, I guess you could say, of music.
[03:10:36.377 --> 03:10:39.357]  He is, I believe he's the grandfather to Merrick Garland.
[03:10:40.175 --> 03:10:50.339]  P Diddy then begins his rap career, his hip-hop career by bringing in a lot of people who would become the next face of rap music at that time.
[03:10:50.359 --> 03:10:57.142]  He would kind of grow to become the mogul of the period back when it was like the late 90s and Def Jam Records.
[03:10:57.242 --> 03:11:04.745]  So you had people like Craig Mack and you had people like Mase, all the rappers that were getting really popular on MTV in the late 90s.
[03:11:05.525 --> 03:11:06.366]  Notorious B.I.G.
[03:11:07.631 --> 03:11:16.135]  Well, what was interesting was that you started to notice, and other people were noticing this even back at the time, a lot of people around the circles of Diddy were dying.
[03:11:16.295 --> 03:11:19.216]  Even famous people were falling into comas.
[03:11:19.957 --> 03:11:21.077]  They were suddenly dying.
[03:11:21.497 --> 03:11:23.558]  Other rappers were meeting their demise.
[03:11:23.618 --> 03:11:27.140]  Heavy D. Let's see.
[03:11:27.160 --> 03:11:29.661]  I'm trying to remember the other guy who ended up in a coma.
[03:11:32.162 --> 03:11:32.642]  One of the 90s...
[03:11:36.994 --> 03:11:43.675]  Like, R&B guys ended up in a coma because he was threatening to write a tell-all book or something like that.
[03:11:45.156 --> 03:11:48.116]  I forget all the details, but it was Al B. Sure, that's right.
[03:11:48.136 --> 03:11:52.737]  Al B. Sure ended up in a coma because he was talking about writing a book, a tell-all book.
[03:11:53.717 --> 03:11:57.438]  And we had this phase of Uptown Records, Bad Boy Records.
[03:11:58.238 --> 03:12:03.839]  A lot of the people at this early stage were, again, ending up dead.
[03:12:05.117 --> 03:12:11.338]  And this is because when Diddy marries Kim, this ends up in a situation where he has her phones tapped.
[03:12:11.378 --> 03:12:15.819]  He's asking her apparently to be involved in a lot of sexual operations.
[03:12:15.859 --> 03:12:20.100]  He's bringing in other guys to be engaged in sex, sex with her, recording it all.
[03:12:20.800 --> 03:12:23.841]  And not just her, but him as well.
[03:12:23.881 --> 03:12:27.401]  So this is turning into a lot of gay sexual compromise.
[03:12:29.122 --> 03:12:34.683]  And this happened, I guess, so many times that people really started thinking that
[03:12:35.655 --> 03:12:36.515]  It's time to call him out.
[03:12:36.555 --> 03:12:38.756]  It's time to go out publicly about this.
[03:12:39.356 --> 03:12:40.596]  But Kim ends up dead.
[03:12:41.836 --> 03:12:48.158]  He ends up paying $250,000 a month to another woman who threatened to come out and talk about all this.
[03:12:49.198 --> 03:12:52.038]  The FBI investigated Diddy in his past for certain crimes.
[03:12:52.078 --> 03:12:56.859]  That could have been a point when he was brought in to do something or run some kind of operation.
[03:12:57.280 --> 03:12:59.360]  The rapper Heavy D was in these circles.
[03:12:59.380 --> 03:13:01.760]  He ends up suddenly dying because he was going to write a tell-all book.
[03:13:03.801 --> 03:13:04.081]  Anyway.
[03:13:05.388 --> 03:13:13.834]  So again, and as this is coming out now, people are going back and digging into all of the people at a high level that Diddy was very, very close to, like Oprah.
[03:13:14.515 --> 03:13:19.378]  And you can better, you better believe, and you might want to save that stuff because they're probably going to scrub all of that.
[03:13:20.659 --> 03:13:23.782]  But it's not just Oprah, it's also a lot of people in the pop world.
[03:13:24.302 --> 03:13:28.565]  He was very close apparently to, or fairly close I should say, to Taylor Swift.
[03:13:29.426 --> 03:13:33.489]  So what we're starting to notice is that the music industry is really kind of a big club
[03:13:34.755 --> 03:13:38.578]  Of sex operatives and compromise and you ain't in it, right?
[03:13:39.519 --> 03:13:43.382]  Well, I don't want to be in it because this turns out that it was all fake and gay the entire time.
[03:13:45.023 --> 03:13:49.047]  And again, this is nothing new because this is the same structure and model.
[03:13:49.067 --> 03:13:50.228]  Are you noticing a pattern?
[03:13:50.548 --> 03:13:51.268]  Boys Town.
[03:13:52.709 --> 03:13:53.350]  Saville.
[03:13:53.910 --> 03:13:54.511]  Elm House.
[03:13:55.031 --> 03:13:55.992]  Sexual compromise.
[03:13:56.032 --> 03:13:56.793]  Cameras everywhere.
[03:13:57.874 --> 03:14:00.676]  The Boys Town Franklin cover-up.
[03:14:01.256 --> 03:14:01.937]  Craig Spence.
[03:14:02.877 --> 03:14:03.378]  Lobbying.
[03:14:03.928 --> 03:14:04.709]  Cameras everywhere.
[03:14:05.529 --> 03:14:06.350]  Gay GOP.
[03:14:07.991 --> 03:14:08.691]  The gay OP.
[03:14:11.713 --> 03:14:13.134]  The Diddy operation.
[03:14:13.635 --> 03:14:14.415]  Cameras everywhere.
[03:14:14.616 --> 03:14:15.316]  Filming all of this.
[03:14:15.816 --> 03:14:19.459]  Adnan Khashoggi's yacht comes up in the first chapter of the Epstein book.
[03:14:20.316 --> 03:14:36.369]  Adnan Khashoggi was some kind of sex operative compromiser too, as well as a weapons trafficker, because he was using his yacht, bringing in Pakistani prostitutes and compromising people on his orgy yacht parties, if you read chapter one and two of Whitney Webb's book.
[03:14:36.609 --> 03:14:38.951]  So again, this is a constant theme that we're seeing.
[03:14:39.832 --> 03:14:46.077]  And when we come back, we're going to talk about more of the sex compromise operations, Diddy, and how the system works.
[03:14:46.894 --> 03:14:47.474]  All right, folks.
[03:14:47.554 --> 03:14:55.018]  I did not intend for this plug, but Kyle Rittenhouse was just here, and Harrison gave him some Rainforce about an hour ago, and he wanted to say something about it, so why not?
[03:14:55.419 --> 03:14:56.659]  Yeah, I was sitting here.
[03:14:56.719 --> 03:14:59.541]  You went to the bathroom on break, and I was like, I'm going to try some of these.
[03:14:59.901 --> 03:15:02.162]  Took two of them, and, wow, am I awake.
[03:15:02.262 --> 03:15:03.403]  But it's clean energy.
[03:15:03.783 --> 03:15:07.545]  I'm not, like, jittery or anxious or sweating.
[03:15:07.705 --> 03:15:08.146]  I'm just awake.
[03:15:08.186 --> 03:15:10.187]  We're not going to give him the dog, are we?
[03:15:10.607 --> 03:15:11.588]  We're not going to give Milo any.
[03:15:11.628 --> 03:15:13.889]  I don't know if that would be good for him.
[03:15:14.474 --> 03:15:17.336]  Brother, tell us of the group you're working with in Texas as their outreach coordinator.
[03:15:17.696 --> 03:15:20.137]  Yeah, I'm the outreach director for Texas Gun Rights.
[03:15:20.177 --> 03:15:23.259]  We're the largest no-compromise gun rights group in the state of Texas.
[03:15:23.319 --> 03:15:24.059]  And they find them where?
[03:15:24.459 --> 03:15:26.400]  You can find them at texasgunrights.org.
[03:15:26.460 --> 03:15:28.041]  Alright, very exciting, brother.
[03:15:28.241 --> 03:15:28.962]  So good to see you.
[03:15:28.982 --> 03:15:29.642]  Thanks for coming in.
[03:15:29.742 --> 03:15:30.402]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:15:30.703 --> 03:15:32.343]  Alright, and thank you, Milo.
[03:15:34.229 --> 03:15:35.029]  What a good dog.
[03:15:35.049 --> 03:15:35.730]  All right, folks.
[03:15:36.130 --> 03:15:42.953]  You can find BrainForce at InfoWarStore.com and BrainForce Ultra and TurboForce coming back in stock.
[03:15:43.173 --> 03:15:44.393]  Karl Rittenhouse, thank you so much, brother.
[03:15:44.413 --> 03:15:45.113]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:15:45.133 --> 03:15:45.514]  God bless.
[03:15:46.394 --> 03:15:48.035]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:48.055 --> 03:15:52.196]  I want to remind you that I'll be live at the Brohemian Grove event.
[03:15:52.256 --> 03:15:53.577]  Elijah Schaefer will be there.
[03:15:53.677 --> 03:15:55.157]  Leonardo Joni will be there.
[03:15:55.398 --> 03:15:59.759]  The Nephilim Death Squad guys will be there, as well as a host of other people, perhaps Shane Cashman.
[03:15:59.779 --> 03:16:03.681]  I just did a great interview with Shane Cashman over on his channel the other day.
[03:16:04.521 --> 03:16:07.263]  From Tim castle shout out to Shane a really cool guy.
[03:16:07.283 --> 03:16:26.617]  We're all gonna be performing and doing various types of things I'll be harassing the audience with singing my cringe core songs and Perhaps other interviews and so forth and we'll have books as well today event October 25 26 if you head on over to my Twitter if you scroll down a little bit you'll find the tickets that are there and
[03:16:27.157 --> 03:16:28.137]  I'll also have the tickets.
[03:16:28.657 --> 03:16:31.278]  Actually, I'll repost the tickets at the top of my Twitter today.
[03:16:31.298 --> 03:16:32.878]  I forgot about that, to get those.
[03:16:32.918 --> 03:16:35.339]  October 25th to 26th in Florida.
[03:16:36.239 --> 03:16:38.419]  It's going to be a great, fun two-day event.
[03:16:39.039 --> 03:16:42.380]  And I'm sure this topic will come up because we're going to be talking about all kinds of stuff there.
[03:16:42.660 --> 03:16:53.682]  This whole idea of recruitment into secret societies, recruitment into sex cults, recruitment into the music industry in Hollywood.
[03:16:54.464 --> 03:17:03.918]  And if you think about the profile of people that are susceptible to these is another element that we could we could mention because who would be susceptible to this?
[03:17:04.665 --> 03:17:14.328]  Well, many pop stars, many actors, they oftentimes, as you can imagine, have probably a little bit or a lot of it of narcissism.
[03:17:14.508 --> 03:17:20.129]  And so if you are a narcissist individual and you are promised the world, you're going to be made a star, all this kind of stuff.
[03:17:20.609 --> 03:17:31.873]  Well, that would certainly appeal to people that have a need to find validation and approbation through large audience sectors to try to get fame and fortune.
[03:17:31.893 --> 03:17:32.733]  I think the
[03:17:34.224 --> 03:17:38.546]  The personality who craves that enough is willing, probably, to do anything.
[03:17:38.586 --> 03:17:46.410]  And this is precisely why a lot of the pop stars, I think, are put through these grades of humiliation rituals.
[03:17:46.430 --> 03:17:49.332]  And I think, again, it's very similar to what you see with organized crime.
[03:17:49.372 --> 03:17:56.015]  I mean, you have to make your bones, right, in the world of the mafia, the organized crime, or even gangs outside of the mafia.
[03:17:56.055 --> 03:18:00.918]  You know, other criminal organizations require you to do something to prove your worth, to prove
[03:18:01.630 --> 03:18:08.853]  Your merit to prove that they have something on you so that you won't go against the gang or the criminal organization.
[03:18:09.333 --> 03:18:17.776]  And so in the same way, I think pop stars, musicians, they're probably required or asked to do certain things to make sure that they're on board.
[03:18:17.796 --> 03:18:29.800]  I think this might partly explain a lot of the humiliation rituals that we see with a lot of pop stars where they're asked to go publicly doing really shameful, bizarre, degrading things.
[03:18:30.629 --> 03:18:33.310]  Yes, there's an element of they're doing it for shock value.
[03:18:33.330 --> 03:18:34.270]  They're doing it for attention.
[03:18:34.390 --> 03:18:36.671]  They're trying to get viral advertising and all that.
[03:18:36.711 --> 03:18:38.311]  Yeah, but there's more than just that.
[03:18:38.371 --> 03:18:42.173]  If you read, for example, the third installment of C.S.
[03:18:42.213 --> 03:18:58.958]  Lewis's Space Trilogy, when he's writing about the organization called NICE, which is a stand-in for the Tavistock Institute, the Royal Society, and its scientism worldview, you'll notice that NICE operates in the same way, where they have a degradation ritual.
[03:18:59.890 --> 03:19:12.562]  They actually put you through these really degrading, humiliating, disgusting actions to make you kind of lose your moral compass and so that you have really no taboo at all.
[03:19:12.742 --> 03:19:13.943]  There's nothing that's taboo for you.
[03:19:14.684 --> 03:19:15.825]  There's a process to that.
[03:19:15.845 --> 03:19:22.832]  They do it on purpose and it's actually very similar to if you read about the history of certain KGB or NKVD sex schools.
[03:19:23.502 --> 03:19:24.683]  They would do the exact same thing.
[03:19:24.723 --> 03:19:34.289]  They would take people who were recruited into KGB sex operations, swallow operations, and that would actually degrade them and get them to do the things that they thought were really gross.
[03:19:34.970 --> 03:19:38.853]  And so whatever you found to be too gross to do, you had to do that.
[03:19:39.453 --> 03:19:42.195]  And the purpose was very cunning, very precise.
[03:19:42.215 --> 03:19:43.896]  It wasn't just that they were a bunch of pervs.
[03:19:43.936 --> 03:19:52.502]  This was actually to make sure that you could be an operative willing to engage in anything that was needed at the time, that your handlers wanted, to compromise whoever they needed to compromise.
[03:19:53.062 --> 03:20:11.795]  And so if you're a sex operative and you find, I don't know, you know, gay sex offensive, you have to be put through that so that you might have to go, you know, compromise some high level dignitary, somebody that maybe you need, you need to be used to compromise somebody at an embassy who happens to have gay proclivities.
[03:20:11.835 --> 03:20:14.396]  You don't like it, but that it doesn't matter.
[03:20:14.436 --> 03:20:15.457]  You serve the state.
[03:20:15.557 --> 03:20:18.319]  You're going to be gay for the state, whether you like it or not.
[03:20:18.699 --> 03:20:22.562]  Again, everything is spanking gay, as we've been saying for a long time.
[03:20:24.705 --> 03:20:32.030]  And again, you can think of other cults, other examples that point to, uh, not necessarily the gay stuff, but I mean, elements of sexual compromise.
[03:20:32.090 --> 03:20:39.734]  If you think, for example, about the process church of the final judgment and Manson, this has a tremendous amount of overlap with Hollywood, the music industry.
[03:20:39.894 --> 03:20:42.316]  Think about the beach, the beach boys and all that.
[03:20:42.856 --> 03:20:54.263]  Brian Wilson, the overlap with Manson, Manson, uh, and his now disclosed, uh, you know, CIA connections via the Tom O'Neill book, which many people had been discussing for a long time anyway, before that book.
[03:20:54.878 --> 03:20:59.463]  Well, now we kind of know that there is this element to Manson.
[03:20:59.583 --> 03:21:04.408]  There is the same element with British Intelligence and the Process Church and the CIA, these overlaps.
[03:21:05.368 --> 03:21:13.777]  And so we don't know all the exact details, but we do know that with these kinds of cults, there oftentimes are these overlaps of mind control.
[03:21:13.857 --> 03:21:18.842]  It does appear that Manson was, you know, definitely brainwashing the girls at the Spahn Ranch.
[03:21:19.733 --> 03:21:20.753]  as well as other people.
[03:21:21.174 --> 03:21:37.599]  You have this overlap, too, with Kenneth Anger, The Rolling Stones, Lucifer Rising, all the avant-garde filmmaking that was going on there, which was, again, a lot of the same sorts of gay sexuality way ahead of its time in terms of what was acceptable on a social level.
[03:21:38.679 --> 03:21:49.183]  And so what was happening in the background of Hollywood and these cults and these intelligence agencies in the 1960s really just spilling over into the mainline culture decades later.
[03:21:50.160 --> 03:21:57.423]  And it's not, I don't think it's accidental that people like Harry Hay, who was a key member of the OTO, he was a part of Crowley's group.
[03:21:57.443 --> 03:22:01.485]  I think he played the organ in one of the California OTO lodges.
[03:22:01.525 --> 03:22:09.129]  Harry Hay becomes one of the founders of, co-founder of NABLA, and also one of the co-founders of the modern gay rights, gay marriage movement.
[03:22:12.070 --> 03:22:18.973]  These situations oftentimes overlap because there's a deep connection between Hollywood as the new Babylon.
[03:22:19.522 --> 03:22:26.488]  In fact, they even made a movie with Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie called Babylon, where Hollywood is really presented as this.
[03:22:26.888 --> 03:22:27.889]  If you think back to D.W.
[03:22:28.049 --> 03:22:47.745]  Griffith and his famous movie Intolerance, the sets that they built where you have basically Babylon and Hollywood as Babylon, they were put up to be the entranceway into where that giant mall is in downtown Hollywood, even to this day in downtown L.A.
[03:22:48.045 --> 03:22:49.146]  So Hollywood is Babylon.
[03:22:50.077 --> 03:22:52.978]  And Hollywood has been for a long time presented as this and pictured as this.
[03:22:53.798 --> 03:22:56.399]  Uh, that's why Kenneth anger wrote the book, Hollywood Babylon.
[03:22:56.419 --> 03:23:03.001]  And if you, if you're interested in that topic, I would say you can go read my books because I also wrote two books, very similar to that topic.
[03:23:03.041 --> 03:23:11.744]  Esoteric Hollywood wanted to, you can get signed copies at my website, Jason analysis.com in the shop where I go into a lot of depth about all of the topics you're going to discuss today.
[03:23:11.784 --> 03:23:13.164]  That's why Hollywood has been so
[03:23:13.951 --> 03:23:16.031]  Esoteric and occultic for so long.
[03:23:16.431 --> 03:23:17.652]  I'm not saying everybody's evil.
[03:23:17.672 --> 03:23:18.992]  I'm not saying everybody in Hollywood's bad.
[03:23:19.012 --> 03:23:20.492]  I'm not saying all movies are bad.
[03:23:20.532 --> 03:23:23.533]  I'm just saying that there is this deeper element.
[03:23:23.873 --> 03:23:25.413]  This is going on in the background.
[03:23:26.273 --> 03:23:33.434]  And, you know, when we were calling attention to this many, many years ago, it was less known, even though it was there, you would see this pop up in a lot of music videos.
[03:23:34.395 --> 03:23:41.876]  And there was even famous cases in Hollywood history of like the Black Dahlia and so forth, where there was this obvious satanic element to it.
[03:23:42.518 --> 03:23:49.343]  It's almost like they gradually just sort of uncloaked and revealed themselves in our day, especially in the last 10 years.
[03:23:49.443 --> 03:23:51.565]  It's just sort of totally uncloaked.
[03:23:52.145 --> 03:24:03.393]  You had famous people in Hollywood like Sammy Davis Jr., other, you know, starlets that were interested in Jane Mansfield, they were members of the Church of Satan with Anton LaVey.
[03:24:04.073 --> 03:24:07.956]  David Bowie famously was interested in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.
[03:24:07.996 --> 03:24:10.358]  He was very into ritual magic for a while.
[03:24:11.781 --> 03:24:13.203]  I mean, at a somewhat serious level.
[03:24:13.223 --> 03:24:19.109]  I don't just mean that they're doing it for, you know, their persona or for their brand.
[03:24:19.950 --> 03:24:23.855]  But I think that to some degree, many of them have been actually interested in this.
[03:24:24.781 --> 03:24:26.662]  But also keep in mind Jay-Z too, right?
[03:24:26.682 --> 03:24:29.803]  Jay-Z and Beyonce for a long time have publicly promoted Crowley.
[03:24:30.243 --> 03:24:34.424]  They wear Crowley in, like, propaganda.
[03:24:36.305 --> 03:24:38.465]  Do what thou wilt with Crowley on the t-shirt.
[03:24:38.505 --> 03:24:40.386]  A lot of occult imagery throughout their videos.
[03:24:41.586 --> 03:24:46.828]  And, you know, now we've had certain pop stars like Ye, who's talked about this.
[03:24:47.308 --> 03:24:50.709]  He seems to have kind of gone off into back and forth and flip-flopped.
[03:24:51.514 --> 03:24:51.774]  I think so.
[03:25:07.581 --> 03:25:08.722]  Other people were saying this, too.
[03:25:08.762 --> 03:25:22.214]  Cat Williams, for a long time, has been saying that this is going on in the music industry, that rap is fake and gay, that they have rituals that they do to initiate you into the club, and it's basically just compromised gay sex.
[03:25:22.254 --> 03:25:29.441]  But he specifically used the term ritual, which I thought was accurate, which was relevant, because
[03:25:30.279 --> 03:25:34.924]  That adds more of a religious component to even to the to the ditty stuff.
[03:25:35.204 --> 03:25:38.407]  So I don't know that that's actually come out yet in any court documents.
[03:25:38.547 --> 03:25:39.128]  It could be.
[03:25:39.148 --> 03:25:50.920]  I've not read through all these court documents yet, but the religious element could be a key sign here because again, a lot of these people get into Crowley, which is largely a lot of gay sexuality in terms of
[03:25:51.440 --> 03:26:00.645]  Religious theology, they have a very vast religious symbology and meaning to gay sexuality and Corleonism and that sect.
[03:26:01.546 --> 03:26:07.169]  Other groups, it doesn't have to be that group, there's other satanic sects and groups and cults that do the same types of stuff.
[03:26:08.690 --> 03:26:11.692]  And so you can see how very basic
[03:26:12.429 --> 03:26:16.091]  Human passions, the desire to have sex, is kind of something that's a very basic need.
[03:26:16.591 --> 03:26:24.135]  These groups prey on the basic needs that we have, and the CIA has used Maslow's studies of the hierarchy of needs.
[03:26:24.776 --> 03:26:33.220]  Humans, you know, require acceptance, love from other human beings, they require, you know, food, they require, and they require sex.
[03:26:33.641 --> 03:26:39.004]  I'm not saying they require gay sex, I'm just saying they require sex, and so what happens is that cunning and
[03:26:40.632 --> 03:26:56.044]  Smart people can prey on this need and lure weak people into these kinds of operations and into these kinds of settings because they already have a proclivity of seeking approval, seeking attention, seeking fame.
[03:26:56.705 --> 03:27:08.995]  All of that need for acceptance is the weak point at which they can be brought into these cults, these circles, these groups, and then co-opted and compromised, groomed, so to speak, into these operations.
[03:27:10.069 --> 03:27:13.570]  Now think about the Dan Schneider stuff with Nickelodeon.
[03:27:13.850 --> 03:27:16.151]  Another situation very, very similar.
[03:27:16.171 --> 03:27:18.471]  I'm not saying that it's a total sexual compromise thing.
[03:27:18.511 --> 03:27:26.173]  I'm just saying it's another situation where we have, you know, pedo type stuff going on in children's entertainment.
[03:27:27.073 --> 03:27:28.974]  All of this stuff is completely degenerate.
[03:27:29.494 --> 03:27:33.475]  It's just a bunch of pervs and weirdos and creeps running these operations.
[03:27:34.461 --> 03:27:44.265]  And they get higher and higher in these structures because they have no scruples and because they're compromised and they're working together with other degenerate compromised people.
[03:27:45.226 --> 03:27:48.707]  And so it's a system that perpetuates itself over and over and over.
[03:27:49.968 --> 03:27:54.350]  And it is based on certain esoteric philosophies.
[03:27:54.930 --> 03:27:57.951]  Not everybody in these systems necessarily has to believe in all that.
[03:27:57.971 --> 03:28:01.453]  They don't have to know all the ins and outs of the esoteric philosophies.
[03:28:02.102 --> 03:28:13.685]  But one of the patterns that we're starting to notice and what is being promoted throughout the pop music is this tendency towards the gay stuff, the tendency towards the trans stuff.
[03:28:13.745 --> 03:28:14.325]  Why is that?
[03:28:15.026 --> 03:28:19.167]  Because most or many esoteric philosophies worship bafflement.
[03:28:19.607 --> 03:28:27.709]  They have this idea that the true God is non-binary or above all binaries or is both.
[03:28:28.829 --> 03:28:30.710]  Because that's a higher, better position somehow.
[03:28:31.309 --> 03:28:38.390]  And we covered that when we lectured through basically the entire, almost all 500 pages of the Cambridge Companion.
[03:28:38.490 --> 03:28:40.091]  This is academia saying this.
[03:28:41.371 --> 03:28:43.471]  It's not me coming up with this, making this up.
[03:28:43.491 --> 03:28:48.212]  This is actual academic history and philosophy.
[03:28:48.932 --> 03:28:50.313]  And again, other books do cover this.
[03:28:50.933 --> 03:28:57.394]  In fact, there was a recent book written on how the entire modern world is kind of built on people like John Dee.
[03:28:58.095 --> 03:28:59.576]  The famous occultists.
[03:28:59.596 --> 03:29:04.079]  There's John Dee and the Empire of Angels, Enochian Magic, and the Occult Roots of the Modern World.
[03:29:05.180 --> 03:29:10.243]  Other books are back in print, too, that have been out of print for a long time that I've been looking at that reminded me of some of these issues.
[03:29:10.884 --> 03:29:21.131]  Now, this is kind of old because it was written in 2002 or 2003, but one of the first books written about the sexual abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church
[03:29:22.000 --> 03:29:22.480]  I don't know.
[03:29:47.347 --> 03:29:50.010]  It's not relying on a lot of conspiracy theorizing.
[03:29:50.070 --> 03:30:03.122]  It's really relying on public news stories of the rampant satanic ritual abuse that was going on in the Roman Catholic Church, which is an element of the pedophile priest story that's oftentimes covered up.
[03:30:05.044 --> 03:30:06.606]  They don't always discuss this.
[03:30:09.537 --> 03:30:12.699]  We've seen pop bands like the Jonas Brothers, for example.
[03:30:12.719 --> 03:30:26.686]  The Jonas Brothers have been seen, I know they're not as popular now, but they were shown with t-shirts of Aleister Crowley promoting just pure satanic stuff, Gnostic Satanism to kids.
[03:30:26.806 --> 03:30:28.727]  I mean, this is not accidental.
[03:30:28.767 --> 03:30:35.550]  It's not an accident that all these Disney pop stars and Disney kids end up suddenly getting into Aleister Crowley.
[03:30:36.531 --> 03:30:38.432]  There's a long history of pop stars
[03:30:39.494 --> 03:30:47.621]  Again, getting connected to or doing public high profile rituals that we've talked about so often.
[03:30:48.482 --> 03:30:57.750]  We talked about, for example, remember Pink back in 2009, she did a ritual, high profile ritual, which was all based on the initiation into the Masonic Lodge.
[03:30:58.379 --> 03:31:01.260]  She did the entered apprentice ritual on stage.
[03:31:01.661 --> 03:31:05.622]  In 2001, the VMAs were a giant satanic service.
[03:31:06.043 --> 03:31:09.804]  Lady Gaga, 2009, she did a human sacrifice service.
[03:31:10.284 --> 03:31:11.785]  We've seen the London Olympics.
[03:31:11.845 --> 03:31:14.406]  We've seen the opening ceremonies of the Goldenberg Tunnel.
[03:31:15.407 --> 03:31:17.168]  That was all openly satanic.
[03:31:17.308 --> 03:31:24.371]  We saw the Olympics a few months ago, all openly satanic, anti-Christian.
[03:31:25.259 --> 03:31:30.582]  Jacobin, a luminous symbolism all throughout the Olympic ceremony.
[03:31:31.243 --> 03:31:38.167]  And you'll notice as this keeps coming out, and as we've written over and over about this for, I mean, I started writing about this topic in 2011.
[03:31:39.388 --> 03:31:45.231]  My first essay critiquing occultism and esotericism in Hollywood was 2011.
[03:31:46.112 --> 03:31:47.393]  Now, I knew about it before that.
[03:31:47.493 --> 03:31:49.514]  I first encountered this idea in about 2004 or five.
[03:31:52.018 --> 03:31:54.319]  But I didn't know enough about it at that time, really, to write about it.
[03:31:54.339 --> 03:31:57.039]  And I think I was listening to Alex at that time, too.
[03:31:57.099 --> 03:31:58.079]  I first heard Alex in 2003.
[03:31:58.119 --> 03:32:03.060]  So I was listening to Alex regularly, and he would talk about, you know, the symbolism in movies and stuff like that.
[03:32:03.080 --> 03:32:07.181]  And that kind of got me interested in going deeper into this in the realm of film.
[03:32:07.201 --> 03:32:08.262]  But it's not just film.
[03:32:08.282 --> 03:32:11.902]  You'll find that, oh, wait a minute, this is actually also in Hollywood.
[03:32:11.922 --> 03:32:18.904]  It overlaps very heavily into what we see in music as well, the music industry.
[03:32:19.742 --> 03:32:22.344]  And it didn't begin with today's pop stars.
[03:32:22.364 --> 03:32:26.706]  When you go back to Madonna, you find out why is Madonna promoting Kabbalah?
[03:32:27.286 --> 03:32:29.308]  In fact, you go back to old videos.
[03:32:29.348 --> 03:32:38.253]  We went and watched recently Madonna's video for Die Another Day, the Bond movie from 2003 or somewhere in there, 2002.
[03:32:39.133 --> 03:32:43.776]  And if you watch the video, the Madonna video for Die Another Day,
[03:32:45.408 --> 03:32:51.331]  It's all about mind control, the fractured psyche, she's being abused, she's being tortured, electroshock, etc.
[03:32:51.851 --> 03:32:55.652]  She's tied down, she's presumably raped as well, in the video I'm saying.
[03:32:56.272 --> 03:33:00.194]  And she then utilizes Kabbalah in the video.
[03:33:00.354 --> 03:33:12.839]  You can see the Hebrew text, she wraps the Teflon around her arm, she starts presumably chanting Kabbalistic prayers, and this is what frees her supposedly from the mind control and the
[03:33:14.921 --> 03:33:15.541]  The abuse.
[03:33:16.302 --> 03:33:19.583]  And I mean, it's just wild to think about.
[03:33:19.603 --> 03:33:30.948]  I mean, I don't, most of us didn't know, you know, 2003, uh, what Kabbalah was or whether Madonna was into Kabbalah that really became popular much later, 2008, nine, 10.
[03:33:31.048 --> 03:33:35.990]  She was promoting the Kabbalah center in LA and publicly about, uh, all about that.
[03:33:36.010 --> 03:33:41.752]  Um, but it turns out, no, actually, uh, Madonna was pushing this stuff and into the stuff, uh, much earlier.
[03:33:42.640 --> 03:33:44.241]  We just had the VMAs recently.
[03:33:44.261 --> 03:33:48.482]  I don't know if, I mean, does anybody even watch MTV anymore or tune into this stuff?
[03:33:48.502 --> 03:33:52.904]  I had not watched anything like this in maybe 15 years.
[03:33:52.964 --> 03:33:54.545]  I don't remember the last time I watched MTV.
[03:33:55.805 --> 03:34:03.709]  I mean, I think the last time I've seen anything from MTV was like Flavor Flav and A House Full of Hoes and Bridget Nielsen was there.
[03:34:03.969 --> 03:34:06.250]  So I don't know if that's like 2003.
[03:34:06.670 --> 03:34:07.610]  I don't know when that was.
[03:34:07.670 --> 03:34:08.631]  Maybe that was VH1.
[03:34:08.831 --> 03:34:09.211]  Who knows?
[03:34:09.975 --> 03:34:12.397]  But I just remember Flavor Flay was trying to marry a bunch of hoes.
[03:34:12.417 --> 03:34:14.178]  That's the last thing I've ever seen from MTV.
[03:34:15.819 --> 03:34:18.521]  But apparently it still exists and they still do the VMAs.
[03:34:19.442 --> 03:34:25.326]  And they gave a, like a Lifetime Achievement Award to Katy Perry, which is like, it's odd.
[03:34:25.366 --> 03:34:31.611]  I mean, usually Lifetime Achievement Awards are when you're like 60 and you're, you know, Roger Moore after 30 years of movies or something.
[03:34:31.631 --> 03:34:35.093]  But no, Katy Perry got some kind of Lifetime Achievement Award and she gets up on stage.
[03:34:35.453 --> 03:34:37.835]  She doesn't really do anything occultic, but now she's just straight up
[03:34:38.436 --> 03:34:52.081]  Implied like sort of pornography when her whole performance There's other people that I wasn't even familiar with I don't know any of the pop stars anymore today, and I'm proud of that I feel like my a boomer now, or am I just like?
[03:34:53.162 --> 03:34:56.143]  immune to the degeneracy
[03:34:57.085 --> 03:35:01.186]  But what I'm getting at is that there's not, is there anything really even edgy anymore?
[03:35:01.407 --> 03:35:10.910]  Because once we've gotten to Lil Nas X and he's like gay humping Satan in a homosexual relationship with Satan, I mean, what else is there?
[03:35:10.930 --> 03:35:14.611]  There's no other, I mean, I guess technically, yeah, we could get more degenerate.
[03:35:14.631 --> 03:35:20.373]  There's, there's things worse than that, but, uh, but I mean, here we are, and this is by design.
[03:35:20.393 --> 03:35:20.873]  That's the point.
[03:35:20.913 --> 03:35:25.855]  Like we, when you get into this idea of cultural degeneracy,
[03:35:27.199 --> 03:35:31.102]  Even in warfare, this kind of stuff is utilized to demoralize.
[03:35:31.162 --> 03:35:37.065]  Remember when we did the sex espionage analysis from the Donald Boer book?
[03:35:37.926 --> 03:35:52.795]  We saw that famous military tacticians and generals, they were perceptive enough a long time ago, even at the time of the British versus the Chinese, or even the Japanese versus the Chinese.
[03:35:54.364 --> 03:36:07.530]  The famous guy we talked about, Kenji Doihara, he had figured out that he could spread throughout China brothels, and the brothels were also places where you could buy opium.
[03:36:07.971 --> 03:36:09.831]  So it wasn't just the British that were doing this.
[03:36:09.872 --> 03:36:13.553]  Kenji Doihara also probably adopted this from the British model of the opium trade.
[03:36:14.754 --> 03:36:21.617]  And he figured out that he was demoralizing vast provinces of China through his vast network of brothels,
[03:36:22.079 --> 03:36:29.485]  The hoes were also spies, and they were also selling heroin and getting everybody hooked on heroin.
[03:36:30.626 --> 03:36:40.514]  So drugs, culture war, and toxic degeneracy spreading is a great way to demoralize a people.
[03:36:41.654 --> 03:36:48.180]  And this is what I'm trying to say to the normies and people like Matt Walls, who doesn't think that there's any organized motivation behind this.
[03:36:49.113 --> 03:36:52.015]  It's all organic and it's just happening and who knows why?
[03:36:52.035 --> 03:36:52.576]  We don't know.
[03:36:52.956 --> 03:37:01.582]  Even though this has been studied by militaries and it's a strategy, it's a known technique for centuries to promote degeneracy as a part of culture war.
[03:37:02.603 --> 03:37:07.867]  It's just like, I mean, warfare is not just fighting with swords and guns and tanks.
[03:37:08.307 --> 03:37:09.488]  There's economic warfare.
[03:37:09.808 --> 03:37:10.609]  There's culture war.
[03:37:11.649 --> 03:37:15.172]  And all of these are used to demoralize the population.
[03:37:15.572 --> 03:37:16.173]  Well, guess what?
[03:37:16.713 --> 03:37:18.094]  All of this satanic psyops
[03:37:19.104 --> 03:37:19.825]  It's being used on us.
[03:37:21.667 --> 03:37:27.775]  And one of the reasons that we never really are able to stave this off, I'm not saying it's not possible.
[03:37:27.855 --> 03:37:28.796]  We can stop this.
[03:37:28.856 --> 03:37:29.477]  It is possible.
[03:37:29.757 --> 03:37:31.439]  We don't have to go down this route.
[03:37:32.240 --> 03:37:38.068]  I mean, Alex has been talking about this, especially the last couple of weeks since assassination attempt number two.
[03:37:39.604 --> 03:37:43.366]  By the deluded Boomer Gen X guy who believes the mainstream stories, right?
[03:37:43.446 --> 03:37:51.550]  He's the perfect example of a person completely brainwashed into what the mainstream media wants a person to believe about Trump and Mog and all this.
[03:37:51.630 --> 03:37:53.170]  It's completely delusional.
[03:37:55.051 --> 03:38:00.253]  And so they're acting according to the perfect mind control of the mainstream media, right?
[03:38:00.654 --> 03:38:02.374]  We don't have to go down that route.
[03:38:03.395 --> 03:38:08.037]  But it's going to require people figuring out that we're up against more than just
[03:38:08.740 --> 03:38:12.101]  The idiots in Washington and throwing the boobs out.
[03:38:12.982 --> 03:38:14.562]  I'm not speaking against Trump here.
[03:38:14.602 --> 03:38:16.543]  I think Trump has to be elected.
[03:38:17.463 --> 03:38:21.025]  Uh, not, I mean, Kamala will basically destroy the country.
[03:38:21.265 --> 03:38:22.125]  We have to have Trump.
[03:38:22.265 --> 03:38:23.446]  There's just no doubt about that.
[03:38:24.166 --> 03:38:31.309]  And I have criticisms of Trump, but look, Kamala will literally, I mean, just her capital gains stuff will destroy the country, destroy the economy.
[03:38:31.429 --> 03:38:32.669]  It's already half destroyed anyway.
[03:38:33.830 --> 03:38:36.651]  So what I'm saying is like, if you understand this,
[03:38:37.543 --> 03:38:39.264]  And how dire the situation is.
[03:38:40.184 --> 03:38:43.765]  And that's what the conservatives cannot understand.
[03:38:44.346 --> 03:38:47.707]  And they're really the main reason that things keep getting worse.
[03:38:47.727 --> 03:38:52.349]  I mean, we know of the left, and we know the Democrats, and we know they're committed to pure evil.
[03:38:52.829 --> 03:38:53.629]  That's who they are.
[03:38:54.449 --> 03:38:56.650]  And God even says, I would rather you be right.
[03:38:57.931 --> 03:38:58.631]  Don't be lukewarm.
[03:38:58.851 --> 03:38:59.451]  Be hot or cold.
[03:39:00.152 --> 03:39:02.393]  Well, they're at least wicked, and we know they're totally wicked.
[03:39:02.933 --> 03:39:04.373]  Totally depraved.
[03:39:05.474 --> 03:39:05.894]  But it's the
[03:39:07.145 --> 03:39:10.066]  Weak conservatives that are really the end of the country.
[03:39:10.106 --> 03:39:13.688]  They're going to be the reason that this country is destroyed.
[03:39:14.568 --> 03:39:15.549]  Because why?
[03:39:15.569 --> 03:39:23.332]  They refuse to recognize what's really going on, that there are conspiracies, that it's way further down the line than we thought.
[03:39:24.193 --> 03:39:27.974]  And they keep propping up the battles of 20 years ago.
[03:39:28.655 --> 03:39:33.457]  And then they'll just concede that battle from 20 years ago and adopt the liberal position from 20 years ago.
[03:39:34.344 --> 03:39:37.849]  That's why conservatism of today is the Democratic Party of 20, 30 years ago.
[03:39:38.069 --> 03:39:38.750]  It's always that way.
[03:39:38.951 --> 03:39:39.171]  Why?
[03:39:39.652 --> 03:39:45.400]  Because nobody has a fixed, actual, hard worldview from which they can predicate truth and falsehood, right and wrong.
[03:39:46.164 --> 03:39:52.589]  It's all about playing politics, constantly compromising, constantly giving ground, because everyone is just defending liberalism.
[03:39:52.649 --> 03:39:54.610]  Everyone has various forms of liberalism.
[03:39:55.171 --> 03:40:01.435]  No one can find true conservatism, which can only be grounded in some kind of theistic Christian worldview, first and foremost.
[03:40:01.975 --> 03:40:09.521]  And it's not going to be found in a bunch of fake non-denominational churches or in Pope Francis's new church, where he says that all paths lead to God now.
[03:40:10.515 --> 03:40:11.576]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:40:11.596 --> 03:40:15.737]  Be sure and head on over to the Infowars store and buy those products to keep Alex on the air.
[03:40:15.757 --> 03:40:16.598]  This is the tip of the spear.
[03:40:16.918 --> 03:40:18.699]  Today's conspiracy theories.
[03:40:19.059 --> 03:40:20.200]  Tomorrow's truths.
[03:40:20.760 --> 03:40:25.122]  Some of these conspiracy theories have turned out to be true.
[03:40:26.382 --> 03:40:26.923]  Which ones?
[03:40:27.608 --> 03:40:56.029]  The Trump-Russia witch hunt, Jeffrey Epstein, JFK assassination, the misuse of the Patriot Act, the Iraq War, the weapons of mass destruction, the war in Ukraine, the bombing of the Nord Stream Pipeline, the open border migration caravans, the climate change scam, Kim Trails, and HARP, and 9-11 being an inside job, and the Internet of Things surveillance grid, and PFAs, and chemicals in the water turning everyone gay, and the 2020 election being stolen, and January 6 being filled with undercover feds, and Bilderberg, and Bohemian Grove, and global government, not to mention gain-of-function research, and the threat of China,
[03:40:56.249 --> 03:40:58.211]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[03:41:21.864 --> 03:41:25.689]  But it's an adventure to wear any of these shirts, but particularly this one.
