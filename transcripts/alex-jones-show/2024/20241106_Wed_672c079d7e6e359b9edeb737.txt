[00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.950]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:12.689]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the Infowars.
[00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.769]  Well, you know what time it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:22.710]  Yeah, it's the war.
[00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.210]  We just won a big battle, but the war is far from over.
[00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.109]  You know, I can't do it on command of my own.
[00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.009]  I only do it when the angel stands right behind me.
[00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.950]  Tells me to do it to show people.
[00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:50.350]  God told me to do it a few times to Tucker Carlson.
[00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.149]  That's why he calls me the most extraordinary person he's ever met.
[00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.170]  But it's not me.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.479]  Last night, we were predicting when Trump would give his victory speech long before they'd said even won.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.980]  And I said, 127.
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.219]  And I just saw the number 127 was told to say 127.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.760]  And I literally sat there and went, am I supposed to say that?
[00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:19.000]  Okay, said it's never wrong.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.019]  And I've told you a lot about that on air.
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.939]  I'll say, get up.
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.219]  I leave my cell phone in the bathroom.
[00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:26.519]  I turn it on.
[00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:29.159]  Don't have a clock in my bedroom.
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.280]  So does that little travel alarm clock that's in the drawer.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.620]  Sometimes I turn that on, but God will say, okay.
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.879]  I don't want you looking at the clock in the drawer.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.700]  I don't want it to be digital atomic.
[00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:44.760]  Get up and walk in the bathroom.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.239]  Hurry up.
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.799]  Turn it on.
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.560]  It's going to be 4 a.m.
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.680]  4 a.m.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.959]  Okay.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.599]  Now start counting down 14 seconds and it'll be 4 a.m.
[00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:52.700]  I know, God.
[00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.180]  I know you're there.
[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.680]  It's exactly on the second.
[00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:54.939]  Okay.
[00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.959]  But last night, I do this all the time.
[00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:58.700]  I mean, you see it on air.
[00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.159]  I said what time he would come out to the second he would speak.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.900]  And I just saw...
[00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.830]  127, I wasn't sure if it was Central or Eastern.
[00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.430]  It was Eastern.
[00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.370]  So my point is, that's how powerful God is.
[00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.789]  So people make fun of Tucker Carlson talking about the demon attacking him.
[00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.330]  He told me about that a long time ago.
[00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.509]  That's when he really woke up and knew God was real.
[00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.750]  And I told you my story.
[00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.569]  It's only happened once.
[00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.629]  And...
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.560]  It happened.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.479]  Because the metaphysical is real.
[00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.560]  It's just stuff we can't see.
[00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:43.879]  But you know you can't see cell phone radiation.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.680]  You can't see cyanide gas in the air.
[00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:52.919]  It's there.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.919]  If somebody puts it out.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.659]  So they can stick a wire into your optic nerve into your eyes.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.419]  A little chip, and then you can see the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
[00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:11.379]  Simple surgery.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.400]  They were doing it 50 years ago.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.300]  And people see all of it.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.740]  They go, whoa, I didn't know you could see this.
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.560]  Well, your brain tunes it out.
[00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:22.000]  This is too much.
[00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.080]  So we have governors.
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.219]  And I just thought I'd start the broadcast with that today.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.080]  And I'll play the clip.
[00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:28.960]  It's not about me.
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.699]  Because...
[00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.310]  I'm just a channel that comes through.
[00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:52.289]  Like my mother's grandmother, who was not in the books or anything, but was pretty much the most famous with the establishment, psychic.
[00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.490]  For quite a while, presidents came and visited her in Dallas to channel her.
[00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.810]  And I wasn't even told about that until, I think she died when I was about eight years old.
[00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:04.669]  Very nice lady.
[00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.009]  But a great oil painter too.
[00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:09.849]  She liked to drink Jack Daniels.
[00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:16.250]  But, you know, that's that.
[00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:27.360]  Of course, her ancestors created the first rebellion in Texas and hired Colonel Travis.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.540]  Of course, then raised his son when he got killed.
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.060]  Good people, strong.
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.660]  You go back to her ancestors, they were in the old English house that fell about 300 years ago.
[00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.199]  They created the stock market and things like that.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.980]  Very interesting people.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.740]  God's given us gifts to use them.
[00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:51.970]  Alright, we'll be right back on the other side.
[00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:53.430]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.550]  We've got a lot to talk about today.
[00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.829]  While everybody's celebrating, the enemy's about to strike back.
[00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:00.050]  You want to really beat them?
[00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.589]  This will be a day long remembered.
[00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:05.930]  It is Wednesday, November 6, 2024.
[00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:24.810]  Just hours ago, from Mar-a-Lago, Florida, the 47th President of the United States, after braving unprecedented attacks to his name, his family, his wealth, To his very life, backed by an American people that are reawakening,
[00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.850]  took humbly to the stage.
[00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:35.639]  Now, the real work is to begin.
[00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:42.019]  My inbox, my phone, everything is full of leftist-throwing fits and super entertaining stuff, and I'm sorry.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:50.600]  If you tuned in here today to make fun of the mind-controlled victims of the New World Order, you found the wrong show.
[00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.829]  And believe me, I like doing it just as much as you do, probably more.
[00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:07.050]  But I'm going to explain something right now, and I know we have millions and millions and millions of new listeners right now and new viewers who are actually saying, well, we better go and actually see what this guy's all about.
[00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:11.110]  And I just want you to know what I'm really all about.
[00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:14.050]  Civilization, security, freedom, justice.
[00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:15.569]  Not the things you've heard.
[00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:27.389]  And To the great activist listeners, I know most of you don't need to be told this, but for some people, I want to communicate to everybody.
[00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:29.910]  And it's just this.
[00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:47.569]  When we won the election, despite massive election fraud, eight years ago, today, because the announcement of the victories were on the 6th and not the 5th, when that happened,
[00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:53.290]  Roger Stone is very smart and did predict Trump would win last night.
[00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:56.370]  He said he'd probably be announced in the early morning hours.
[00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:59.389]  He said it Sunday, so Roger nailed it.
[00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.170]  I mean, I really can't remember when he was wrong.
[00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:08.529]  He said to me privately, Trump's going to lose four years ago.
[00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:10.509]  And I go, what do you mean?
[00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:13.730]  He goes, well, he's going to have a narrow victory and they'll steal it.
[00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:21.050]  He tells you the truth on air, but it's for political consumption, so he holds back bad news.
[00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.769]  But privately, he's the best there is.
[00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:25.810]  That's why they want him in prison.
[00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:37.709]  And he told me a month ago on the phone, he said, don't tell anybody this, I'm going to tell you now.
[00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:42.750]  He said, no, he's winning about 10-15 points.
[00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:50.610]  And Roger looks at all the polls, the internal stuff, the big data systems that corporations have that are much more accurate.
[00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.670]  But we knew we had to have about 10% extra to override their fraud.
[00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.170]  And we had it.
[00:07:58.509 --> 00:08:00.209]  But something else big happened.
[00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.990]  There were the RNC under Trump's control...
[00:08:05.529 --> 00:08:12.589]  Did a excellent job compared to the zero percent job that got done four years ago when they stole it.
[00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:26.370]  And so all over the country in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, the trucks arrived at one in the morning, all places on TV, but the news was all waiting.
[00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:27.990]  Independent media was there for a project.
[00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:33.230]  The different projects like O'Keefe Media Group were all there.
[00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.909]  Crowder's people were there.
[00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.029]  Those key states.
[00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:45.129]  And when the big trucks pulled in with the ballots and the police and everybody were staring at them, they couldn't do the steal.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:09:10.080]  That's kind of like if you have a canary and you got a cat and the canary's in a high cage and the cat doesn't try to get to the canary when you're home, but you go to church or whatever and come back and somehow the cat has climbed all the way up on top of the drapes and then jumped 15 feet out in the middle of the room and knocked the birdcage down and the canary didn't get eaten,
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.700]  but it's up in the rafters.
[00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:13.840]  That actually happened about five years ago.
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.600]  My daughters convinced me to get two canaries.
[00:09:17.059 --> 00:09:18.940]  And I said, we've got two cats.
[00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:24.899]  And I said, they'll go after them.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.759]  And because I knew that because I wanted a canary when I was a kid, my mom had a cat.
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.580]  And my dad had put it in a big cage about six feet up in the middle.
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.679]  And the cat still found a way in a big room to get somewhere and get on top of it.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.700]  Sure enough, the canaries were there.
[00:09:39.899 --> 00:09:41.779]  We actually went to for about a week.
[00:09:42.419 --> 00:10:00.279]  And then one of the cats, I'm not sure which one, got up on the 20-foot tall ceiling in my living room and Got up the huge drapes, obviously climbed them, and then jumped at least 20 feet out in the middle of the room and knocked it off its stand.
[00:10:01.019 --> 00:10:03.240]  And then the birds got out and were up there.
[00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:05.840]  That was a fiasco, getting them back down.
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.720]  And then they both died of stress.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.299]  But I don't mean to go off on a side story.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:09.919]  You're not too near for that.
[00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:12.039]  The point is, it's the same thing.
[00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:18.360]  The cat couldn't get the canaries last night because everybody was watching.
[00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.730]  So, that's what happened.
[00:10:28.409 --> 00:10:42.549]  And it shows when we're motivated, when people take action, and people aren't naive and admit there's fraud and don't let them gaslight you, then evil's done.
[00:10:43.289 --> 00:10:55.179]  Thomas Jefferson was asked, Why does evil seem to take over most countries over and over again in history?
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.879]  And he said, because good men and women do nothing.
[00:11:00.019 --> 00:11:02.460]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is good men do nothing.
[00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:05.240]  And that's really the moral of this whole broadcast.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.440]  We've been brought up to be spectators.
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.200]  We're set in front of a TV in our diapers.
[00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:12.980]  And your brain gets trained to think everything's just entertainment.
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:18.279]  I mean, 50 years ago, 30 years ago, there was a car wreck or something, everybody pulled over to help.
[00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:19.740]  Now, most of the cars just drive on by.
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.240]  You see, China, it's even worse.
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.399]  Somebody will be dying in the street for days, no one helps them.
[00:11:25.299 --> 00:11:28.340]  And the more totalitarian a country is the less people help you.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.820]  And what kind of world is that?
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.039]  Where nobody renders aid, because then nobody's going to care about you when you're being screwed over or you're hurting.
[00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:37.919]  And that's our big problem.
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.980]  And I go back to this a lot before I lay out the big news here.
[00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:52.830]  Is that as populist, as people that just don't want World War III, Christians, capitalists, common sense people, folks that aren't suicidal.
[00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:54.070]  I mean, that's basically who we are.
[00:11:54.129 --> 00:12:01.330]  We'd like to not blow the planet up and eat bugs and be giving poison shots, self-replicating nanotech, and then we're the bad guys.
[00:12:01.549 --> 00:12:06.049]  We don't want some fat pedophile to teach our five-year-old that they're really another sex.
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:15.879]  I mean, we just don't want fentanyl killing hundreds of thousands of people a day and giant human kidnapping of children and weird, crazy, creepazoid leaders.
[00:12:15.879 --> 00:12:16.879]  I mean, just please.
[00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:23.899]  Who have an appetite to do horrible things because it's evil.
[00:12:25.669 --> 00:12:31.190]  And I've been around some people before when they finally uncloak and they go, I just like to do bad things.
[00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.490]  Well, I just want to get away from you.
[00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:38.409]  And if you won't get away from me and you try to hurt me, I'm going to hurt you.
[00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.149]  And I'll do it with information and with legal issues.
[00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.590]  And if it gets physical, I mean, I'll kill you.
[00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.870]  I will kill you.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:47.799]  Just like that.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.179]  I'll break your neck so fast.
[00:12:50.379 --> 00:12:51.659]  I'll bash your brains out so quick.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:52.879]  I'll gouge your eyeballs out.
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.059]  And it's not because I'm a mean person.
[00:12:55.059 --> 00:12:56.320]  It's my head screwed on straight.
[00:12:57.779 --> 00:13:01.600]  See, I haven't had my human instincts God gave me bred out of me yet.
[00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:03.480]  I'm like my ancestors.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.340]  And so are you.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.740]  But you really need to reawaken who you are and stop letting people push you around.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.100]  Because it's not work to fight tyranny.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.620]  It's what you're designed to do.
[00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:14.159]  Just like...
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.200]  Getting on a Stairmaster or lifting some weights or stretching or Pilates or yoga.
[00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:21.059]  At first, you're not doing it a lot.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.700]  It feels terrible.
[00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:23.759]  But later, you get addicted because it's good.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.700]  It's like saying, I don't want to breathe.
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.720]  I want to be on a respirator.
[00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:27.600]  It's so hard to breathe.
[00:13:28.059 --> 00:13:29.759]  It's a luxury to be paralyzed.
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:30.860]  Well, no, it's not.
[00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:35.539]  But that's an extreme example of what we're becoming on one end.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.200]  So the moral is...
[00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:55.889]  The existential danger, the red flashing lights, the just out of control megalomania of the establishment, finally got a majority of people, through self-preservation itself,
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.039]  To say, whoa, and break with the trance.
[00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:03.779]  Because they were always making the propaganda more ridiculous, more insane.
[00:14:03.919 --> 00:14:05.419]  There are no XY chromosomes.
[00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:06.440]  Two men can have a baby.
[00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.000]  They know that's ridiculous.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.039]  They're not crazy.
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:17.000]  They're trying to break your will in a cult to tell you not to ask questions and to believe whatever they say, which the New York Times says, don't ask questions.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.340]  Kids' school books say, don't ask questions.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.259]  Believe what you're told.
[00:14:21.129 --> 00:14:22.210]  That's the opposite of science.
[00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.409]  They say science is not asking questions.
[00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:25.809]  Science is asking questions.
[00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:27.669]  It's literally the definition of it.
[00:14:30.009 --> 00:14:40.269]  So it has to be this incredible wall of lies because what they're going to do goes against logic, common sense, and self-preservation.
[00:14:40.269 --> 00:14:55.220]  So they need to make it bizarro world and have a bunch of weak people That are domesticated, who'll go along with it, who'll then try to bully you to go along with it, and they tell the slaves, oh, things will get better for you when you make those other people comply.
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.960]  That's when we get to the promised land.
[00:14:57.139 --> 00:15:01.139]  No, you don't get to the promised land by complying with King Charles and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates.
[00:15:01.299 --> 00:15:02.320]  You get to hell.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:14.720]  And when you're for Kamala Harris, and when you're for Tim Walz, you are literally for the global New World Order that on record says, quote, the future isn't human.
[00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:20.090]  And Elon Musk hangs out with the heads of Google, and they tell him, we're sick of you defending humanity.
[00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:20.990]  Humans are bad.
[00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.269]  Why should we even have humans?
[00:15:22.669 --> 00:15:23.889]  The future isn't human.
[00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.149]  And he names names.
[00:15:25.529 --> 00:15:26.809]  Sergey Brin, Larry Page.
[00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:30.629]  And I've been around those type of people.
[00:15:31.129 --> 00:15:33.309]  I mean, right up at their level, at the top.
[00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:37.309]  I haven't met them, but I've met the other big names that invited to big meetings.
[00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.029]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:40.570]  In places with 100-foot ceilings.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.159]  Marble ceilings.
[00:15:44.059 --> 00:15:45.460]  Black marble ceilings.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:47.740]  And...
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.360]  They just look at you like a damn bug.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.840]  And when you act like a bug, you are a bug.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.399]  Well, I'm here to tell you, I didn't come from bugs.
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.120]  I don't want to be treated like a bug.
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.639]  And to get out of this, I gotta get you to wake up.
[00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:07.779]  So when I'm trying to get you to wake up and be free, that's because that makes me free.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:08.840]  Comprende?
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.259]  So...
[00:16:11.799 --> 00:16:18.000]  The big takeaway is people started to get up off their ass some, and you see instant victory.
[00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:25.669]  Now, obviously, the real work It's now beginning.
[00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:32.950]  Going back to Roger Stone, I got digressed talking about him calling the election, sort of thinking about him and thinking about his prediction came true last Sunday.
[00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.149]  But finishing up, Roger was just euphoric.
[00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:37.809]  You know, 3 a.m.
[00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:38.470]  when he got off the air.
[00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.049]  He took an Uber at like 7 and went to the airport.
[00:16:41.149 --> 00:16:41.649]  We didn't sleep.
[00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:51.710]  We were sitting around having a drink in the conference room at about 6.30 and his Uber was coming.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.179]  And he was smoking a cigar.
[00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.159]  I was smoking a cigar.
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.960]  We were having martinis.
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.360]  And we both like martinis.
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.220]  Dirty martinis.
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.160]  And he said, man, you're really down.
[00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:10.539]  I know you're tired.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.539]  I said, no, Roger.
[00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:14.799]  I said, they're coming after all of us now.
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.140]  We've just gotten a beachhead.
[00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:21.460]  And if Trump doesn't understand that the people around him are going to lie to him, and if he gets any globalist in there...
[00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.390]  They're going to accelerate their plan, and they're going to put us in prison or kill us.
[00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.950]  He said, no, no, Trump will clear that out.
[00:17:28.029 --> 00:17:29.430]  This is going to be great.
[00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:31.630]  I've been in other transitions, Reagan and others.
[00:17:32.069 --> 00:17:33.130]  We're going to do it.
[00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:34.829]  And I said, I don't think so.
[00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.309]  So Trump calls me the next day.
[00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:45.930]  And I said, sir, you better have people vetting who's around you, because they'll lie to you, and they're going to sabotage you, and they're going to come after you.
[00:17:46.769 --> 00:17:51.369]  And you're being spied on, and I said, already I see these people being listed.
[00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:53.150]  And then...
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.900]  Other stuff started happening.
[00:17:57.319 --> 00:18:00.339]  So Trump would call me or have his people call me and say, who's this person?
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:00.920]  Who's that person?
[00:18:01.019 --> 00:18:02.599]  And I started telling him, well, this person's bad.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.920]  This person, I don't know.
[00:18:04.099 --> 00:18:05.319]  This person's good.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.859]  And it wasn't that I was so smart.
[00:18:08.059 --> 00:18:12.299]  No one else that was good wanted to tell Trump because there were more bad people.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.839]  They would gang up on the good people and kick them out.
[00:18:14.859 --> 00:18:16.279]  So the good guys would hide in their offices.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.779]  And they still got kicked out.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.579]  Flynn didn't hide in his office.
[00:18:20.039 --> 00:18:21.160]  Bannon didn't hide in his office.
[00:18:21.319 --> 00:18:22.259]  So you saw what happened to them.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:23.900]  That was it.
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.519]  Bannon and Flynn.
[00:18:29.259 --> 00:18:32.980]  So now, everything is who Trump gets in.
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.720]  But that's still the next step in 76 days.
[00:18:38.759 --> 00:18:40.819]  Or you can say 75, 74.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.960]  Until January 20th, 21st.
[00:18:47.619 --> 00:18:49.960]  So, that's the next step.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.220]  The current one, after securing the victory as president-elect...
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:09.059]  Is they will, will, will, will, will capital W ILL try to kill Trump again.
[00:19:09.819 --> 00:19:19.039]  And again, this is not some movie or entertainment show or John Wick and all that stuff.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.940]  This is not fantasy land.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.740]  This is the real world.
[00:19:23.339 --> 00:19:30.099]  So I told you the week before they tried to kill Trump in Butler, I said, it's imminent.
[00:19:31.859 --> 00:19:33.039]  Because they were apoplectic.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:33.759]  Nothing was working.
[00:19:33.859 --> 00:19:34.740]  Everything was backfiring.
[00:19:34.859 --> 00:19:36.079]  The convictions were backfiring.
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.660]  They had the internal polls.
[00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:38.720]  They knew a landslide was coming.
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:46.079]  They knew that Trump had the poll watchers and the lawyers everywhere and that they weren't going to be able to get away with massive steel on the day.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:53.539]  So they pre-baked it in, but the landslide was so big that it overrode it, like I told you.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.220]  So, we could change the future right now.
[00:19:57.559 --> 00:19:59.119]  Trump needs to rest.
[00:20:00.539 --> 00:20:02.599]  He needs to take a breath.
[00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:04.420]  He needs to then get the right people in.
[00:20:04.779 --> 00:20:12.000]  And he needs the aircraft with the anti-missile flares.
[00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:15.839]  And he's to now limit the speeches.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:16.960]  Damn it.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:25.480]  Because he could have done just as good, doing more podcasts than the rallies, and sticking his neck out there.
[00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:26.980]  But whatever, he did it.
[00:20:29.539 --> 00:20:29.980]  And...
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:35.619]  We need to pray for Trump, because this is the real deal.
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:38.660]  Now...
[00:20:39.869 --> 00:20:41.289]  They're going to attack from all sides.
[00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:44.109]  And I want to walk through some of the different things that are going to happen.
[00:20:44.269 --> 00:20:47.809]  But I think you've figured out that I know what I'm talking about.
[00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:49.509]  But I've had to open the calls up.
[00:20:49.809 --> 00:20:51.789]  The listeners all bring up even better points than I do.
[00:20:51.869 --> 00:20:54.269]  We all get it, this audience of activists.
[00:20:54.690 --> 00:21:03.950]  The question is, how are we with this giant audience we have right now going to properly make sure that this information gets out to the public?
[00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:17.069]  And I'm talking about the Majority of America that supports Trump and supports common sense and supports not being suicidal as a civilization.
[00:21:18.839 --> 00:21:22.099]  So I'm going to go through incredible clips, analysis, all of it.
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.220]  Owen Schroer's coming in to go over the latest numbers in the House and Senate.
[00:21:25.339 --> 00:21:26.019]  It's still ongoing.
[00:21:27.259 --> 00:21:30.059]  But Trump, right now, it looks like he's going to have the trifecta.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:35.920]  But I've seen past elections where Republicans are heading the House and then we're not watching and they steal the last few.
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:44.359]  And then the FBI indicts some more of the Republicans in the House so they go to jail.
[00:21:44.599 --> 00:21:45.799]  I mean, it's...
[00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:51.190]  It's important that we watch all that.
[00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:59.170]  And then there's another big facet, and I really want to create a list, a bullet point for everybody, because I know you all get this, but we kind of need a thing to hang on the refrigerator door.
[00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:07.589]  When you call and talk radio or call Congress or talk to your friends or put something on X or wherever, and we really get this out there in the information war, and that's how we affect the future.
[00:22:07.769 --> 00:22:08.670]  We have the power.
[00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:09.230]  We use it.
[00:22:09.349 --> 00:22:10.410]  We're taking our country back.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.619]  But we have to keep him alive.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.960]  He's got to get the right people in the government.
[00:22:22.039 --> 00:22:34.259]  And then all at the same time, we need to be unifying and magnanimous to the victims, the brainwashed zombies of the MSM cult.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.259]  Some of them are pure evil, but most of them are just delusional, think they're the good guys, think they're on the winning team, think they're intellectual, think they're smart.
[00:22:45.079 --> 00:22:46.380]  They're not street smart for sure.
[00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:54.269]  We've got to be nice to them and let them know that they've been in a cult.
[00:22:54.509 --> 00:22:55.549]  They've been brainwashed.
[00:22:57.109 --> 00:22:59.089]  And everything's a cult.
[00:22:59.309 --> 00:23:00.029]  Everything's a tribe.
[00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.029]  They can join, you know, the classic Americana.
[00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.410]  Everybody around the world saw it and wasn't perfect.
[00:23:05.569 --> 00:23:07.109]  Boy, it was the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:08.849]  Come on back to America.
[00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:10.430]  Come on.
[00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:17.170]  Now, that said...
[00:23:21.589 --> 00:23:30.170]  We have to, because justice demands it, not out of vengeance, and because the globals will continue to hurt innocent people.
[00:23:30.769 --> 00:23:33.650]  If we don't, it's like having cancer and only cutting part of it out.
[00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:54.039]  The globalist leadership and the people that executed the operations, like Brennan and Clapper and Comey, Need to be given a fair trial and put in prison.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:10.960]  And that corrupt, arrogant political class that's done so much against us needs to be taught a lesson that you can't act like this, and you can't terrorize people, and you can't stage terror attacks, and you can't spy on presidents, and you can't leak lies,
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:15.380]  and you can't start World War III, and you can't smuggle, kidnap...
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.799]  I mean, I want Mayorkas under the prison.
[00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:21.170]  I mean, that is a...
[00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:22.450]  That's Lex Luthor for real.
[00:24:22.569 --> 00:24:25.170]  His actions are evil, but you just look at him.
[00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:26.950]  I mean, my skin crawls.
[00:24:27.089 --> 00:24:28.970]  That is a bad man.
[00:24:29.289 --> 00:24:30.450]  I mean, woo!
[00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.690]  That is evil!
[00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:39.250]  That man shines.
[00:24:44.269 --> 00:24:44.750]  Yeah.
[00:24:46.089 --> 00:24:47.390]  That's an entity right there.
[00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:48.890]  That's a walking...
[00:24:51.339 --> 00:24:51.839]  Demon.
[00:24:53.779 --> 00:24:54.920]  And so is Hillary.
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.380]  So is Alexander Soros.
[00:25:01.319 --> 00:25:03.160]  The father is a reanimated corpse.
[00:25:05.559 --> 00:25:09.460]  So, they have to be dealt with.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.380]  I mean, we just can't let them assault us.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.880]  And yeah, I'm the one that said, other people aren't, so they'll come after me more.
[00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:19.599]  That's fine.
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:20.240]  That's why I'm here.
[00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:30.529]  I'm just an instrument that God's using, a vessel, an impure vessel, imperfect, but I'm not a coward.
[00:25:31.569 --> 00:25:36.569]  And I will execute my mission to the best of my ability, faithfully, until the end.
[00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.509]  So, that's what we have to do.
[00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:51.730]  And we have won the greatest battle in the history of the globalists the last, really, hundred years, this current configuration of corruption.
[00:25:54.779 --> 00:25:57.279]  The corporatized British Empire merged with America.
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.700]  Empire, that's what the globalists are.
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.299]  And they hate us.
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:10.720]  This is the greatest defeat by 50 times.
[00:26:14.059 --> 00:26:18.279]  I mean, early on, Trump just had the idea of taking on the New World Order.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.200]  And that was some people in his camp.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.819]  But that was kind of like the flavor.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:23.680]  There was some of that.
[00:26:24.019 --> 00:26:25.660]  Now it's 100%.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:35.720]  And just the fight to get him in has been a death blow to their system.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.900]  Not even Grievous.
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:38.880]  They're bleeding out.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:40.420]  Yeah.
[00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:40.680]  Yeah.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.039]  They'll never come back.
[00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:51.619]  I mean, they might crawl around for a while, but they'll never come back.
[00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:54.579]  I mean, we basically slit their throat.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:59.079]  And it's the political time it'll take for the carotids to spray out the blood.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:08.579]  I mean, they'll be dead in 30 seconds, and then political time, a couple years maximum, unless they blow us all up and overturn the chessboard.
[00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.069]  So, they're on the ground bleeding out.
[00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:17.529]  And I would just advise everybody that's still on their back.
[00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:20.690]  You know, it's your little satanic mommy right around the back of it.
[00:27:20.769 --> 00:27:21.549]  I'd get off.
[00:27:22.289 --> 00:27:24.269]  Because the maggots are going to consume that really quick.
[00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.430]  And if you're down there on the corpse, you're going to get eaten.
[00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:30.789]  I'm telling the New World Order right now, you need to surrender.
[00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.869]  We know what's best for you.
[00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:32.390]  We'll be right back.
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:39.720]  I respectfully ask you to pay attention to what I'm about to say because it is critical in three important ways.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.319]  It'll keep my broadcast on the air.
[00:27:42.579 --> 00:27:54.990]  It will get you the highest quality, amazing CBD that's so good for your whole body, inflammation, joints, You name it, and you're getting the best deal you're going to find anywhere.
[00:27:55.309 --> 00:27:58.210]  I've been promoting and selling CBD for more than 20 years.
[00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:02.650]  Everybody knows how amazing it is, but not all CBD is equal.
[00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:16.049]  This is a high quality, made in Texas, very strong CBD, thousand milligram tincture that has been put in nanoparticles, so it's eight to nine times stronger than regular CBD that already gives you great effects.
[00:28:16.859 --> 00:28:26.640]  On top of that, we private label it from a top company that sells it to a bunch of other companies that sell it from between $140 to $90 to $76.
[00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:33.519]  This is the lowest price you're going to find on CBD of this quality anywhere in the market.
[00:28:33.859 --> 00:28:36.519]  The industry just massively marks it up.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:43.000]  There's still some good margin in here for our sponsor to support their operation and support us.
[00:28:43.099 --> 00:28:44.799]  And then that savings is passed on to you.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:51.579]  So if you want to get great CBD and keep the broadcast on air, visit JonesCBD.com.

[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.019]  All right, 74 days.
[00:29:32.019 --> 00:29:34.640]  We count Inauguration Day 75 to Target.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.920]  Get Trump in.
[00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:38.099]  Major battle won.
[00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:45.750]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, this is the greatest battle in the history of the fight against the globalists by light years.
[00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:56.930]  We've now got to protect Trump, make sure the right people get in there, and we have to go on the offense, legally and lawfully, and in the information war, to keep the globalists on the defense.
[00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:03.630]  We have to put their leadership in prison, not out of vengeance, but so it can't reconstitute an attack.
[00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:09.190]  I mean, you know, if you catch a king cobra in your house, you don't, you know, put it in your neighbor's yard.
[00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:12.710]  So that's what has to be done.
[00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:22.009]  And we got a lot of issues to deal with and a lot of things to stabilize and Trump's being handed a complete disaster zone, as you know.
[00:30:22.509 --> 00:30:26.170]  We got to let the globalists know if you release another virus, we know you did it.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.420]  We've got to just absolutely fight for our very existence.
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:34.259]  And yeah, we made it past this level.
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:39.339]  But I saw a lot of people in 2016, when I told you the war had just begun...
[00:30:41.329 --> 00:30:42.529]  Saying, oh no, we've won.
[00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:44.690]  And you saw where that got you.
[00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:47.130]  Now, the war has not just begun now.
[00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:49.849]  In the last nine years, the globalists have been drawn out.
[00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:51.269]  The whole world's turning against them.
[00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:53.009]  Populists are being elected everywhere.
[00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:58.329]  The war is about 80% won right now.
[00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.829]  That doesn't mean there's some better roses and cupcakes on the other side.
[00:31:00.869 --> 00:31:01.609]  There's some utopia.
[00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:04.230]  We just won't have a global strategic...
[00:31:05.259 --> 00:31:13.440]  Power Elite Array, there's always going to be Power Elites, that is literally anti-human, anti-prosperity, eugenics death cult.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.880]  But hey, I'll take it.
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:16.500]  So...
[00:31:18.179 --> 00:31:24.660]  You saw people get up off their derrieres and go out and be watching.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:33.599]  And as Owen said, and it's now completely clear and it's proven, they pre-packed the election fraud early instead of having early in the middle and after.
[00:31:33.779 --> 00:31:37.279]  Last time, everybody was watching when the trucks arrived in the battleground states at 1 a.m.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.819]  And all the media was there and all the independent media was there.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.460]  And they just said, it's over.
[00:31:43.019 --> 00:31:44.400]  That's why they kept holding off.
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.279]  But the cavalry came.
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.660]  Well, sorry, everybody's watching this time.
[00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:51.910]  So, this is a great exercise in victory.
[00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:55.029]  It is a blueprint for the future.
[00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:57.430]  And I will just say this right now.
[00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:06.490]  On the scale of effectiveness of this broadcast and the listeners spreading the word and the amount of listeners we had, no exaggeration.
[00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:10.970]  I can't even count it all up on X alone, but on the radio stations here, everywhere.
[00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:13.910]  Just the clips we put out yesterday...
[00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:19.450]  Had, on our channel alone, over 60 million.
[00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.930]  Then I saw a bunch of other copies of it everywhere without even...
[00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:24.049]  I was not looking for it.
[00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:29.509]  I saw another 200 million this morning on other people's channels.
[00:32:29.809 --> 00:32:33.490]  I mean, 20 million, 12 million, 18 million, 16 million, 22 million, 21 million.
[00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:34.049]  I mean, it's just...
[00:32:34.049 --> 00:32:35.609]  I can't even keep up with it.
[00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:40.630]  That is a hole-in-one, grand slam, royal flush...
[00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:44.309]  Victory for the listeners of what you did.
[00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:46.130]  We've all been instrumental in this victory.
[00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:46.549]  Okay.
[00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:54.750]  On the scale of funding, we did a F- yesterday.
[00:32:55.630 --> 00:33:00.049]  And I know what's going to happen if InfoWars gets shut down next week.
[00:33:00.109 --> 00:33:01.349]  And it's up for sale.
[00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:04.150]  Good chance it will be shut down by the 14th.
[00:33:04.289 --> 00:33:05.049]  The sale's the 13th.
[00:33:05.089 --> 00:33:06.150]  And the bad guys get it.
[00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:09.910]  They say they're shutting it down when the wire clears.
[00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:10.569]  Okay.
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.799]  And they're saying they've already pre-done it where it's ready and approved.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.359]  So they want us instantly off.
[00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:18.160]  Everybody's gonna go crazy when we get shut down.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.380]  Oh my God, we didn't know it was real because we've survived so much.
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:25.480]  It creates a cry wolf thing, but we're not crying wolf.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.460]  All the shutdowns, the attempts were in the news.
[00:33:27.559 --> 00:33:29.960]  They admitted we just survived it by the grace of God, your support.
[00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:38.970]  So it's like Muhammad Ali's now in the 12th round, and he's been knocked down, and he's knocked down the other guy a few times, and we're exhausted and bleeding, and you're like, well, he'll be fine.
[00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.630]  No, we haven't won the fight yet.
[00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:44.150]  And there's nothing more frustrating, and I'm not complaining.
[00:33:44.349 --> 00:33:45.849]  This is what God's plan is fine.
[00:33:48.009 --> 00:34:04.059]  If I don't get a bunch of money, and it's not even that much in the fight, if I don't get a ton of money, I mean, to me, individually, it would be a ton of money, and In the middle of this transition, in the middle of them trying to kill Trump,
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:17.480]  in the middle of us trying to identify bad guys if they slip in, which is our real work, not just on air but off, I will be handicapped and will not be as effective.
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.019]  All right?
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:26.659]  So, and regardless, any extra support comes in if we roll into the info war if we do continue on.
[00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:29.010]  So I'm going to be very clear right now.
[00:34:29.329 --> 00:34:30.949]  And I want to thank those that do support.
[00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:32.469]  And I get the economy is in the crapper.
[00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:34.550]  But you've got to decide, hey, this is a pretty important outlet.
[00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:40.530]  I'm still going to apportion your political defense fund for yourself and your family.
[00:34:41.809 --> 00:34:43.849]  You're giving to some church that does absolutely nothing.
[00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:47.110]  We do more to expose the devil and abortion here than those fake Christian churches.
[00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:52.750]  I would like folks to tithe to freedom and to this operation.
[00:34:53.269 --> 00:34:56.510]  And I will say, I think we're doing a lot better than 99% of the churches.
[00:34:57.389 --> 00:34:59.329]  So I think you consider that a tie to this operation.
[00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:02.489]  It's not tax-exempt and all that because we're not under the government's control.
[00:35:03.309 --> 00:35:13.309]  So, we try to make it easy with incredible game-changing supplements, great patriot apparel to meet people, spread the word, exercise your First Amendment that's critical, let the bullies know they don't control it.
[00:35:13.389 --> 00:35:20.650]  We got a bunch of Trump One stuff at the Alex Jones store, a lot of great Trump hats, Alex Jones, Infowar stuff.
[00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:22.130]  It's a fundraiser.
[00:35:22.809 --> 00:35:29.019]  And I gotta tell you, I need funds for the legal ongoing fight.
[00:35:31.019 --> 00:35:36.219]  And I can stay on the air perpetually unless they just pull the internet kill switch or start World War III, which might happen.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.300]  It's not a probability now.
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.099]  It's a possibility.
[00:35:39.099 --> 00:35:41.360]  It was a probability just 24 hours ago.
[00:35:42.559 --> 00:35:49.849]  So there's nowhere you can spend money better Nobody's got better pro-human patriot apparel.
[00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.230]  Nobody's got better supplements than the AlexShieldStore.com.
[00:35:53.369 --> 00:35:54.130]  So it's a win-win.
[00:35:54.630 --> 00:36:01.510]  And quite frankly, you're not defending yourself and your family and common sense and just your very life.
[00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:04.110]  If you're not supporting InfoWars, you're crazy.
[00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:06.570]  I mean, we reached...
[00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:10.130]  I mean, let's not exaggerate.
[00:36:10.349 --> 00:36:17.969]  I saw on X... Without even trying, I started counting it up this morning.
[00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:18.710]  I said, well, that's a lot.
[00:36:18.809 --> 00:36:19.150]  That's a lot.
[00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:19.769]  So I sat there.
[00:36:19.849 --> 00:36:24.550]  I probably spent 30 minutes I shouldn't have, not researching news, but just wanting to give you this number.
[00:36:24.989 --> 00:36:25.769]  Let's be conservative.
[00:36:25.969 --> 00:36:31.849]  I saw like 260, 270 million views on the deals.
[00:36:34.039 --> 00:36:34.980]  That's pretty good.
[00:36:35.139 --> 00:36:36.079]  I think we're doing a little...
[00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:37.900]  That's kind of a nice fight the enemy.
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.719]  No one's doing that but Elon Musk and Trump.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:42.880]  And Carlson.
[00:36:44.199 --> 00:36:44.960]  And Rogan.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.159]  So that's it.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.219]  And Rogan's got plenty of money.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:51.780]  That's great.
[00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:53.980]  And Musk has got it and Trump's got it.
[00:36:54.119 --> 00:36:54.519]  So...
[00:36:56.139 --> 00:36:56.980]  We need support.
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.500]  We're just as effective, in fact, more hardcore.
[00:37:01.019 --> 00:37:04.340]  We create the talking points and the deep analysis that everybody else adopts.
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:11.360]  And I need folks to go to alexjones.live.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.980]  That's the subpage at alexjones.network.
[00:37:15.019 --> 00:37:18.360]  You can see where the shopping carts are, where the sponsors are, where the Vimeo is.
[00:37:18.679 --> 00:37:19.619]  You can subscribe to Twitter.
[00:37:20.579 --> 00:37:24.800]  If you want to support us, it's free, but you can be a subscriber and backer.
[00:37:25.719 --> 00:37:27.300]  There's a Bitcoin there.
[00:37:28.699 --> 00:37:34.619]  And if you're not donating to your own defense, that's what this broadcast is, I don't know what you're doing.
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:36.380]  So it's really simple.
[00:37:36.579 --> 00:37:39.380]  Another great sponsor is drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:37:39.519 --> 00:37:41.920]  Really high quality, low cost, 40% off.
[00:37:42.099 --> 00:37:47.659]  Corsetin and CoQ10 that everybody should be taking during the winter, but year-round cleans out your cells, makes you feel great.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.380]  Super antiviral, does so much for your brain, your heart.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.519]  Those who are there at drjonesnaturals.com finally came into stock.
[00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:57.550]  We've got the ultimate...
[00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:01.210]  ...sea moss.
[00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:02.650]  People go, oh, sea moss.
[00:38:02.849 --> 00:38:03.889]  Is that the bottom of your boat?
[00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:07.409]  No, it's Irish sea moss that is the superfood...
[00:38:08.909 --> 00:38:15.710]  Per milligram, it is well known to have the most organic, high-quality iodine and other key minerals and cofactors.
[00:38:15.849 --> 00:38:17.110]  It's the way the vitamins and minerals are together.
[00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:19.389]  And it just does insane things for your body.
[00:38:19.929 --> 00:38:23.750]  And all the globalists and the Hollywood folks are all gobbling it for years.
[00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:28.150]  And it's really high quality from a top manufacturer that lets our folks private label it.
[00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:31.789]  We've got capsules and gummies.
[00:38:31.889 --> 00:38:33.269]  The capsules are twice as strong as the gummies.
[00:38:33.369 --> 00:38:33.670]  It's there.
[00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:35.190]  Just go check out the supplements.
[00:38:35.389 --> 00:38:36.429]  Okay, I'm going to stop there.
[00:38:36.929 --> 00:38:40.889]  I mean, it's like, wow, we need to get poll watchers and get Republican lawyers to stop the fraud.
[00:38:40.989 --> 00:38:41.309]  We did it.
[00:38:41.369 --> 00:38:41.710]  We won.
[00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.929]  Hey, you better support.
[00:38:44.429 --> 00:38:45.150]  InfoWars is going to shut down.
[00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:45.809]  He's got products.
[00:38:45.909 --> 00:38:46.269]  He needs help.
[00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:49.690]  Eh, well, that guy, you know, we wouldn't be here without InfoWars.
[00:38:49.809 --> 00:38:50.630]  We're just not going to support it.
[00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:51.610]  Okay, I understand.
[00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:55.610]  And I guess you're going to let your three-year-old play in the expressway traffic, too.
[00:38:55.769 --> 00:38:59.349]  I mean, to me, it is an absolute no-brainer.
[00:38:59.469 --> 00:39:02.010]  And we have our most important work coming up.
[00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:16.190]  And just quite frankly, I have to sit here five, ten minutes, an hour just to be able to operate at a third of capacity.
[00:39:17.989 --> 00:39:21.329]  I mean, we could be destroying the globalists.
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:25.300]  We just have more support because I wouldn't be on air talking about this so much.
[00:39:26.019 --> 00:39:28.840]  And I'd have more reporters, people on the ground, and doing a lot more.
[00:39:29.239 --> 00:39:40.940]  So if you want me to fight for you, and I mean, we've proven we're the best there is, because your support, we're hands down, recognized by the bad guys and the good guys, the best there is.
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.340]  That makes us a big target.
[00:39:43.639 --> 00:39:47.420]  All I'm asking is for your aid and comfort in this war, that we're winning.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.059]  So now is the time to fight through, to press the attack.
[00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:56.570]  To fight through the objective, as General Flynn said, and to support the broadcast now.
[00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.289]  You went out and you voted.
[00:39:58.409 --> 00:39:59.409]  You went out and exposed the fraud.
[00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.269]  You supported Trump.
[00:40:00.449 --> 00:40:01.690]  That is good.
[00:40:01.789 --> 00:40:02.829]  That is great.
[00:40:03.369 --> 00:40:16.849]  Now, apply it to the original system That through our listeners launched the current global awakening we are in.
[00:40:17.769 --> 00:40:20.429]  And I always talk about this.
[00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:21.510]  God told me this.
[00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:22.210]  I saw the paradox.
[00:40:23.789 --> 00:40:25.750]  Okay, well, you're going to help launch the whole thing.
[00:40:25.889 --> 00:40:26.389]  It's going to trigger.
[00:40:26.889 --> 00:40:28.849]  It's going to get really bad that it's going to get a lot better.
[00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:32.530]  But then evil is going to strike back down the road, but that's all part of God's plan.
[00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:33.949]  That's down the road.
[00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.329]  But this is all part of God's plan.
[00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:42.469]  But then you're, at some point, will become obsolete because there'll be so many people that understand it.
[00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:44.869]  It just won't be, you know, you at a prominent level doing it.
[00:40:45.809 --> 00:40:48.630]  And a lot of other great people were doing it for me, but they weren't very prominent.
[00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:50.929]  We popularize reality.
[00:40:52.329 --> 00:40:57.079]  And You know, then your job will be done.
[00:40:57.199 --> 00:40:58.780]  But I know my job's not done.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.219]  God's telling me my job's not done.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:00.800]  Not yet.
[00:41:01.599 --> 00:41:06.179]  So, if you want to keep me in my mission, the crew on our mission, make the decision now.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.320]  Go to the AlexShillStore.com.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.360]  Go to DRTroats.com.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:09.780]  And it's so easy.
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.360]  It's just an action and you get great products.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:21.320]  But I understand that this world of fantasy and world of watching things, people are just so paralyzed that even if they like something, it's to get out and do it just seems like it's impossible when it's so easy.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.420]  And I want to thank those that have been supporting.
[00:41:24.539 --> 00:41:28.500]  Maybe I shouldn't harp on those that are on the fence and whatever, and just thank those that have been supporting.
[00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:31.519]  You're the reason we're still here, so you know they're great products, so thank you.
[00:41:31.719 --> 00:41:32.559]  All right, I'm going to stop there.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:33.340]  I'm done.
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.659]  I'm not going to even plug next hour.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.840]  Martin Armstrong's coming on The Great Economist and more.
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.199]  I made a lot of accurate predictions.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:44.280]  I wanted to bring Owen Schroer in here, and he'll be popping in throughout the broadcast, staying on his own show, 3 p.m.
[00:41:44.739 --> 00:41:47.199]  He was up here until, you know, 2 in the morning with me or whatever.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.179]  It was 2.30 last night.
[00:41:49.579 --> 00:41:51.599]  But, Owen, you did a great job last night.
[00:41:51.619 --> 00:41:52.659]  Everybody really was impressed.
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:58.139]  Not just our listeners, but millions of others were like, wow, this is better than the other analysis on the channels, getting up there, going through the numbers.
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:04.599]  We called it before everybody accurately, but we've still got serious situations in the House and Senate.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.019]  There have been three gain in the Senate, three gain in the House, but that could...
[00:42:08.449 --> 00:42:09.250]  Move back and forth.
[00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:10.909]  A lot of races are still open.
[00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:18.469]  And if you look at the past, when everybody starts not watching those days and weeks later, that's when we almost lost the house last time and they took a bunch of seats.
[00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:27.730]  So again, we won this big battle, but there's still skirmishes going on in the last battle that secures the future battles for winning the war.
[00:42:28.369 --> 00:42:31.369]  Owen, give me your reflections on last night and let's get to the latest numbers.
[00:42:32.659 --> 00:42:34.260]  Well, we got the trifecta.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.659]  That's pretty much a done deal.
[00:42:35.659 --> 00:42:38.719]  It looks like the House is going to be a slim majority.
[00:42:39.039 --> 00:42:43.159]  I mean, when you're talking, let's say, four, maybe eight max seats, it could be...
[00:42:43.159 --> 00:42:44.539]  That's a slim majority.
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.400]  Senate, you're going to have three-seat majority, maybe more.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.480]  So that's a strong majority in the Senate.
[00:42:50.519 --> 00:42:52.139]  But yeah, I hope that these...
[00:42:54.259 --> 00:43:03.440]  We're good to go.
[00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:30.630]  The elephant in the room is that the fraud of 2020 is now clear and present when Joe Biden gets 81 million votes and Kamala Harris is going to get at least 10 million less, maybe even 15 million less.
[00:43:30.909 --> 00:43:32.469]  We'll see when the final numbers come in.
[00:43:32.949 --> 00:43:34.710]  So these are impossible numbers.
[00:43:34.949 --> 00:43:37.170]  And when you go and you look, well, where...
[00:43:38.019 --> 00:43:39.179]  Where was the fraud coming in?
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:43.619]  Well, Harris did not perform well in the rural areas.
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:47.599]  She did not perform well in the major cities.
[00:43:47.599 --> 00:43:52.239]  She was not getting nearly the same numbers as Joe Biden in the major cities.
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:56.099]  So I think what we're going to see is There was a very small...
[00:43:56.099 --> 00:43:58.460]  Well, there was a big enthusiasm problem.
[00:43:58.659 --> 00:44:02.920]  There was small enthusiasm for Harris, specifically in the rural areas and in the downtown areas.
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:11.699]  But I also think when we get the final numbers, we're going to really hone in on, as if we didn't already know, how they rigged the 2020 election.
[00:44:11.699 --> 00:44:13.679]  And it's going to be the exact cities we expected.
[00:44:14.119 --> 00:44:17.699]  Milwaukee, Detroit, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Phoenix.
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:34.239]  Because the numbers there are where Harris sees the drop-off That in a close election, like we saw in 2020, you only needed 10,000, 20,000, whatever the final number ended up being, to put Biden over the top in those cities.
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:37.500]  So Harris really had a disastrous performance, though.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:43.219]  And I think when you look at Trump's numbers, they're really close to what he did in 2024.
[00:44:43.219 --> 00:44:44.940]  He actually might get less votes.
[00:44:45.139 --> 00:44:49.239]  Again, just showing what an absolute fraud the 2020 election was.
[00:44:50.039 --> 00:44:53.360]  I do think Trump did have a little bit more enthusiasm in 2020.
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:45:01.300]  That might just be because of COVID and people were just itching to do anything and go out and do a boat parade, a truck parade, a flag wave, a rally.
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:07.719]  I think it also could be Trump maybe softening his stance on abortion and some other issues.
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:12.460]  But Trump's numbers are going to be pretty consistent with what we saw in 2020.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:17.019]  So Trump remained where he was, I think, overall when you look at it, consistent.
[00:45:17.239 --> 00:45:21.039]  Probably going to come in right around 75 million, maybe even a little less, actually.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:27.840]  But the drop-off from Biden to Harris really shows that there was a lot of voter fraud issues in 2020.
[00:45:28.099 --> 00:45:30.179]  It shows that it was a stolen election.
[00:45:30.539 --> 00:45:34.219]  And the funny thing is, it's the Democrats and some of their big...
[00:45:35.179 --> 00:45:51.320]  We're good to go.
[00:45:53.099 --> 00:45:58.059]  If you zoom in on the areas, you'll see that Harris, she just did not get the votes.
[00:45:58.179 --> 00:46:01.719]  She did not get the votes in Phoenix to win Arizona.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.219]  She did not get the votes in Philadelphia to win Pennsylvania.
[00:46:05.579 --> 00:46:08.340]  She did not get the votes in Atlanta to win Georgia.
[00:46:08.539 --> 00:46:11.880]  She did not get the votes in Milwaukee and Detroit, where Biden has to vote.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.239]  Let's do this.
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.280]  The crew's in there.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.300]  The crew did a great job last night.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.480]  Can we do what we did yesterday?
[00:46:16.719 --> 00:46:17.900]  Can people pull up the...
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:21.760]  Maybe we need to go stick in the other studio so we can show people or put whoever was in there running out here.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.440]  She did a great job.
[00:46:22.599 --> 00:46:25.420]  You won't be able to go into the county level on these Google Maps.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.659]  You'll have to go either to CNN or the New York Times, whichever one.
[00:46:30.079 --> 00:46:30.960]  Let's do this then.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.099]  I guess I lost in translation.
[00:46:33.099 --> 00:46:35.079]  I said I wanted you to do today what you did yesterday.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.800]  And I guess we're not going to be able to do it in the studio.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:38.940]  That's just how the studio is.
[00:46:40.219 --> 00:46:43.000]  So I got Martin Armstrong coming on.
[00:46:43.159 --> 00:46:44.360]  Do you want to come on at 1230?
[00:46:45.059 --> 00:46:46.199]  Because you did a great job.
[00:46:46.199 --> 00:46:47.139]  I'd like to repeat that.
[00:46:48.179 --> 00:46:49.099]  You want us to go over there?
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:51.480]  I don't think they'll be able to pull anything up in there, no.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.019]  That's just how it works in there.
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.139]  So, I mean, you can go show them what you want.
[00:46:56.199 --> 00:46:56.980]  It's just not going to happen.
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.380]  I mean, it was great what you don't...
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:01.000]  There we go.
[00:47:01.059 --> 00:47:01.320]  Go ahead.
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:14.380]  So if you go into Philadelphia County and the greater Philadelphia area, you're just going to see that compared to 2020, Harris's numbers are nowhere near where Biden got.
[00:47:14.539 --> 00:47:16.420]  In fact, guys, let me actually, if you can...
[00:47:17.059 --> 00:47:18.400]  Logo's in the way for me there.
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:21.800]  Yeah, I can't.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:22.300]  There you go.
[00:47:22.719 --> 00:47:28.559]  Yeah, so that's 70,000 votes down from what Biden got in 2020.
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:29.579]  70,000.
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:35.639]  And when you consider how tight the 2020 race is, that would be a difference maker right there.
[00:47:36.119 --> 00:47:38.199]  Now, Trump's big...
[00:47:42.909 --> 00:47:59.230]  We're good to go.
[00:48:02.829 --> 00:48:04.150]  How are they going to strike back?
[00:48:04.289 --> 00:48:04.989]  I've got how they are.
[00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:06.869]  They're openly saying the deep state's going to go completely ape.
[00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:08.429]  Critical clubs coming up next hour.
[00:48:08.829 --> 00:48:12.409]  But we need to get them on the defense.
[00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:14.590]  We need to make sure they don't kill Trump.
[00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:16.889]  But also, you're really good at looking at the numbers.
[00:48:16.949 --> 00:48:17.630]  I've got them here, too.
[00:48:18.369 --> 00:48:21.289]  When are we going to find out what's happening finally in the Senate and the House?
[00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:22.369]  Particularly the House.
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:28.119]  Well, that's kind of an interesting bag because those are all local elections.
[00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:33.059]  And so all you can do is just monitor those counties as they're coming in.
[00:48:34.289 --> 00:48:36.670]  I mean, right now, I think it's pretty settled.
[00:48:36.849 --> 00:48:40.570]  I mean, I would say it's safe to say Republicans are going to maintain the House.
[00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:43.250]  It's just going to be a slim majority.
[00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:44.469]  I'm thinking maybe four.
[00:48:45.329 --> 00:48:54.510]  So just, you know, if any of those seats flip in the next 24, 48 hours, then those campaigns will have to be monitoring that and find out what happens.
[00:48:55.369 --> 00:49:00.530]  But yeah, those are all smaller races and they are in these smaller districts.
[00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:03.010]  So we just got to monitor that.
[00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:12.769]  But I think, again, though, it's safe to say at this point the Republicans are going to complete the trifecta and get the Senate and the House.
[00:49:13.489 --> 00:49:15.650]  So I don't think they got it, Alex.
[00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:16.610]  I don't think they got it.
[00:49:17.309 --> 00:49:19.409]  I think that the Republicans are watching.
[00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:25.030]  I hope that they're continuing to watch with the RNC these smaller elections.
[00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:27.570]  Because yes, we have seen that before.
[00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:30.269]  But I just think they don't have it.
[00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:32.289]  I think that they've run out of gas.
[00:49:32.329 --> 00:49:33.630]  I think that they've run out of momentum.
[00:49:33.949 --> 00:49:36.710]  I think they're deflated today, quite frankly.
[00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:40.849]  And so this election is a done deal.
[00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:43.150]  Yeah, I want to make a point on that.
[00:49:43.889 --> 00:49:50.769]  And we had the clips of them saying it, but even the New Yorker magazine last week said if they don't win this, the entire power structure is done forever.
[00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:51.710]  Globalism is dead.
[00:49:51.809 --> 00:49:52.590]  The New World Order is dead.
[00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:57.269]  Yuval Harari, all these big globalist executives in Hollywood and corporate media.
[00:49:57.750 --> 00:50:01.769]  And they said if we can't control the public and pull this off, it's over for us.
[00:50:01.929 --> 00:50:02.449]  We're dead.
[00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:04.130]  They said Main Street Media is dead.
[00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:05.230]  No, it's been dead a long time.
[00:50:05.389 --> 00:50:06.429]  It's been zombied.
[00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:08.570]  It's been reanimated.
[00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:09.590]  It's been propped up.
[00:50:09.849 --> 00:50:17.429]  And so then you've got all these weak-minded people that did follow it, but those are only the very, you know, most mind-controlled, stupid people.
[00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:18.809]  And then I've got all these clips.
[00:50:18.929 --> 00:50:22.349]  Let me just read the headlines from the clips, and we have the video of this coming up next hour.
[00:50:22.889 --> 00:50:26.389]  Jake Tapper and Anderson Cooper, this is the greatest comeback in history.
[00:50:27.199 --> 00:50:27.800]  It is.
[00:50:28.039 --> 00:50:34.739]  The entire most powerful evil empire in the world, the globalists that run our country, threw everything at the American people and Trump and it backfired.
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.159]  And all the fraud and all of it, it is.
[00:50:37.239 --> 00:50:43.840]  And this is the biggest political victory ever without violence against the most evil force in history, the globalists.
[00:50:44.119 --> 00:50:51.280]  I mean, you cannot historically find anything else like this except the colonies beating the British Empire that nobody had ever beaten.
[00:50:52.039 --> 00:50:58.920]  Okay, so this, and the world was a lot less populated and didn't have nuclear weapons then, so that was historically important for us now.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:09.320]  It's all one continuum, but on that timeline, this is like, if points of liberty and events against tyranny are mountains, this is...
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:20.639]  The highest peak in the world right now we're on, other than Jesus Christ's way above that, but in American history and modern history, and since the Renaissance, this is Mount Everest.
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.199]  I mean, this is the top.
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:23.360]  This is...
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:27.519]  And we've got to look from here now how they're going to strike back, and we need to...
[00:51:28.519 --> 00:51:40.619]  Basically use this energy to jump and to launch even further and not sit here and think we've won because we just handed the baton in the relay to the last runner.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.400]  We've not finished the race yet.
[00:51:42.559 --> 00:51:43.300]  Look at some of these headlines.
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:49.599]  This election is something of an indictment of the political information complex.
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.420]  The story that was portrayed was not true.
[00:51:51.619 --> 00:51:53.280]  We just ignored the fundamentals.
[00:51:53.719 --> 00:51:59.409]  That's on CNN. Of course, the little globalist here.
[00:51:59.809 --> 00:52:02.309]  Trump-hating pundit Chris Wallace.
[00:52:02.469 --> 00:52:04.130]  This is not just his party.
[00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:05.210]  This is his country.
[00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:06.349]  You mean it's our country?
[00:52:06.449 --> 00:52:07.909]  Taking it back from you, you little scumbag?
[00:52:07.969 --> 00:52:08.730]  You bet on the wrong team.
[00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:10.510]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:13.309]  We've got the deep state pledging.
[00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:24.489]  And I've got those clips here where they are pledging that they are going to get Trump and that the deep state, here it is, we've got the clip coming up as well.
[00:52:25.269 --> 00:52:33.369]  NBC questions whether a Democrat coup against Biden was right move as Harris election odds went down the toilet.
[00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:38.389]  And then we've got other reports where they promise that the deep state is still going to get Trump.
[00:52:38.769 --> 00:52:40.670]  Rachel Maddow, I mean, oh, this is wild.
[00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:44.150]  Yeah, I think they don't have the strength.
[00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:45.570]  I gotta be honest.
[00:52:45.809 --> 00:52:46.969]  I think they may try to make it.
[00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:48.170]  They may try to make that lift.
[00:52:48.289 --> 00:52:49.969]  They might try to make that push.
[00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:50.750]  I think they're gonna fail.
[00:52:50.949 --> 00:52:52.809]  I think this was a deflation last night.
[00:52:53.329 --> 00:52:54.869]  They don't have the public support.
[00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:56.250]  We have the mandate.
[00:52:56.469 --> 00:52:57.210]  We have the country.
[00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:58.590]  We have the populist movement.
[00:52:58.969 --> 00:53:00.750]  Any move they make, I think they fail.
[00:53:00.849 --> 00:53:02.110]  I think the weight falls on their head.
[00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:07.909]  If we execute and exercise the power, We'll be right back.
[00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:08.630]  Stay with us.
[00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:11.150]  So, I'm just asking you to keep me in the fight.
[00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:17.449]  And we got great t-shirts and incredible blow-you-away supplements and everything, and our great sponsor, yellowstonestore.com.
[00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:31.130]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction, and I, because I hadn't really, you know, there's other folks on this, other folks that are great run this, the folks at Bigly, great patriot backers, total patriots, jsexers, you name it.
[00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:34.369]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:38.329]  So when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:49.150]  So if you're a member of the Alice Jones VIP Club at alishjonesstore.com forward slash VIP, or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation.
[00:53:49.719 --> 00:53:51.960]  We don't know what the future holds for the operation.
[00:53:52.199 --> 00:53:56.400]  The following information I'm about to relay to you is imperative so we can stay in touch.
[00:53:56.579 --> 00:53:59.619]  You can get great products and keep me on the air one way or the other along with the crew.
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:01.219]  Monthly member credits.

[00:54:07.139 --> 00:54:08.280]  Did you hear what I just said?
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:08.739]  That's right.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:12.420]  It's like money in your pocket with the best products on the planet.
[00:54:12.869 --> 00:54:16.750]  So you pay 30 bucks to be a VIP, and then you get 40 bucks free.
[00:54:16.889 --> 00:54:17.829]  That's $10 you make.
[00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:28.690]  All the Alex Jones products at the best prices, we're talking about 10 to even 40% off the already existing sales, so sometimes it becomes lost leaders, in the store 24-7, 365 days a year.
[00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:32.610]  This is an unbeatable pricing you'll never find anywhere else.

[00:54:42.259 --> 00:54:44.760]  The winner of the sweepstakes will be announced the 30th this month.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:45.760]  You want to win?
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:46.920]  I know you do.
[00:54:47.119 --> 00:54:49.659]  Because the VIP will get double entries in every single giveaway.
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:52.300]  No effort, just double your chances just like that.
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.519]  Exclusive VIP-only giveaways.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.440]  This is where it gets big, folks.
[00:54:56.559 --> 00:55:00.059]  VIP members get entered into their own exclusive giveaways every month.
[00:55:00.159 --> 00:55:01.800]  Nobody else is allowed in these.
[00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:04.590]  Early access to products, promos, and giveaways.
[00:55:04.909 --> 00:55:09.869]  VIP members get first access to new products, promotions, and giveaways before anyone else.
[00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:11.090]  You're in the know.
[00:55:11.489 --> 00:55:13.329]  Oh, and did I mention orders over $99?
[00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:14.530]  Free shipping.
[00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:17.710]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[00:55:17.869 --> 00:55:19.110]  It just goes on from there.
[00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:26.230]  So, theallocshownstore.com forward slash VIP. Orders at the top of theallocshownstore.com, you see the VIP button.
[00:55:26.619 --> 00:55:28.559]  We're fighting the new world order.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.460]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[00:55:30.599 --> 00:55:35.159]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.599]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:38.320]  Yellowshowstore.com.
[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:44.599]  It's up to you whether you want to back The number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:53.920]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[00:55:54.099 --> 00:56:01.159]  And I just don't know why I'm such a lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:03.320]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:06.260]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[00:56:06.739 --> 00:56:07.539]  We've already...
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:09.460]  Just devastated them.
[00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:12.619]  I mean, world government, the dual orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:14.179]  The whole world's turning against them.
[00:56:14.699 --> 00:56:18.480]  They're super dangerous as they're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:29.170]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've ever understood, that I should let these Criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[00:56:29.489 --> 00:56:30.949]  So, again, I don't give up.
[00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:33.829]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[00:56:34.050 --> 00:56:37.469]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.929]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:41.409]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:50.130]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control overs with a social credit score and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[00:56:50.289 --> 00:56:58.500]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:00.980]  I mean, it's just...
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:02.340]  This is a joke.
[00:57:02.639 --> 00:57:03.780]  This is ridiculous.
[00:57:04.199 --> 00:57:05.340]  We're changing the world.
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:08.340]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[00:57:08.699 --> 00:57:13.460]  Well, we only have regular guests on that have the highest rate of accuracy in their predictions.
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.219]  And there's a lot of those folks.
[00:57:15.219 --> 00:57:16.480]  You still see them in mainstream media.
[00:57:16.659 --> 00:57:18.760]  Even though Martin Armstrong's been all over mainstream media.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.719]  Mainstream media is no longer the media.
[00:57:21.629 --> 00:57:26.409]  This is the media, and he's going to be joining us coming up in about five minutes when a bunch of stations join us.
[00:57:26.769 --> 00:57:28.650]  But Owen, you're going to be back in the third hour.
[00:57:28.909 --> 00:57:33.690]  You'll be back in there with the big board with all the numbers because there's still House and Senate races ongoing.
[00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:38.449]  This is when they do try to pick a few things off in 2018, 2020, 2022.
[00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:39.489]  They're going to try it again.
[00:57:39.610 --> 00:57:44.789]  So this battle that we've won the main battle, but they could still steal some of the gains.
[00:57:44.989 --> 00:57:48.230]  So talk about the latest, and then we'll go to break it up with Martin Armstrong.
[00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:52.210]  Well, we're going to zoom in on these House races that are still up.
[00:57:52.349 --> 00:57:55.829]  We'll also crunch the latest numbers in the Senate races as well.
[00:57:55.949 --> 00:58:04.889]  But I think that when you look at Trump's victory, it pulled these senators, these Senate candidates, over the finish line.
[00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:08.489]  I mean, that's how big Trump's victory was last night.
[00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:13.349]  It pulled, I think, probably three seats across the finish line in the Senate as well.
[00:58:14.639 --> 00:58:19.320]  We'll break all that down with the numbers when I rejoin on the big board in the third hour.
[00:58:20.059 --> 00:58:23.599]  The House races are a little more interesting.
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.500]  In fact, it's a bit of an anomaly.
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:28.380]  I think that there's two factors at play here.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:37.219]  One, just the way the districts broke down, it favored the Democrats in this cycle for some of these seats.
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:39.940]  Just the way the districts that were up broke down.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.980]  And so we can look at that.
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:46.739]  But I think also what we're seeing here is...
[00:58:46.739 --> 00:58:48.300]  Republicans...
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:51.139]  I look at the Carrie Lake campaign, and this is an anomaly to me.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:57.440]  By the way, I think Carrie Lake is probably now the number one option for Trump to be press secretary.
[00:58:58.099 --> 00:59:03.480]  But you look at a Carrie Lake and you think, why can't she win an election?
[00:59:03.739 --> 00:59:07.880]  And maybe you point to the past race and you say, well, it was stolen from her.
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:08.539]  It was fraud.
[00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:23.949]  Or maybe we need to look at some of these other races, some of these local races and some of these Senate races and find a way to rebrand conservatives, rebrand Republicans, find a way to...
[00:59:30.329 --> 00:59:46.030]  We're good to go.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:53.579]  Even in the other states that Trump was winning, these Senate races were tighter in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, in Michigan.
[00:59:53.719 --> 00:59:56.739]  The Senate races were tighter than the presidential races.
[00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:09.079]  So, Republicans need to find out, why did Trump perform better than these down-ballot candidates in the Senate and in the House?
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.280]  So I think that it's something that needs to be studied by the GOP in order to have more success in the future.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:26.300]  Because even though I do still believe you're going to come out of this election with the House and the Senate and the White House, you feel like it could have been more.
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.539]  You feel like you left a little bit on the field.
[01:00:28.559 --> 01:00:30.119]  You left a little bit on the table.
[01:00:30.619 --> 01:00:33.119]  And I think that we need to figure out how that is.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:39.179]  So we're going to dig into these House races because it's important that we continue to monitor these as the days go on.
[01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:46.429]  Because in the past, specifically, actually after 2016, we saw it every election cycle, 2018, 2020, 2022.
[01:00:47.469 --> 01:00:51.369]  And they would flip a House seat in the third, fourth, fifth day.
[01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:54.070]  They would flip a Senate seat in the third, fourth, fifth day.
[01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:56.230]  So we're going to continue to monitor this here.
[01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:59.809]  I hope the GOP and the RNC are monitoring these things too.
[01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:00.510]  I get it.
[01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:08.250]  The big Trump victory kind of has a bunch of gravity that can distract us from these smaller races that might feel inconsequential, but they won't be.
[01:01:08.639 --> 01:01:12.179]  No, I mean, we have to have the trifecta to destroy the globalists.
[01:01:13.539 --> 01:01:15.760]  Well, I do think the trifecta will happen.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.519]  But there's no doubt, whatever energy...
[01:01:18.519 --> 01:01:21.519]  I mean, let's say Trump's evil, like they use a bad analogy, I'm not saying he is.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:22.960]  Sauron needs the ring.
[01:01:24.059 --> 01:01:30.239]  Whatever energy they have left, they will put into what races are still on the table, I'm sure.
[01:01:30.679 --> 01:01:36.219]  And I assume that Watley and Lara Trump are at least monitoring these things.
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.719]  We've got to get Sauron the ring.
[01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:39.610]  We're going to get the three.
[01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:40.789]  We're going to get the trifecta.
[01:01:40.909 --> 01:01:41.550]  We're going to get it.
[01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:42.849]  We are the ring race.
[01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:43.869]  We're going to get in the ring.
[01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:44.949]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:45.409 --> 01:01:46.210]  That's how the left sees it.
[01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:46.710]  I'm just joking.
[01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:47.489]  Kinda.
[01:01:47.789 --> 01:01:48.349]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:51.309]  Alright, I've got a bunch of incredible guests.
[01:01:52.179 --> 01:01:59.440]  We're good to go.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:12.380]  We're good to go.
[01:02:13.619 --> 01:02:19.699]  And greatest defeat of the globalists ever and just celebrate because we just won a huge strategic battle.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.880]  It'd be like if the Russians in World War II beat the Nazis at Stalingrad and then just quit.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:29.900]  Yeah, they're beaten if you keep pressing the attack and fight through the objective.
[01:02:30.739 --> 01:02:32.760]  So, I would use the Stalingrad analogy.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.280]  We just fought Stalingrad at great cost.
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.880]  We just won Stalingrad.
[01:02:38.159 --> 01:02:42.219]  Now we gotta roll in to Germany proper.
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:44.619]  And that's where we are.
[01:02:45.019 --> 01:02:48.460]  And so, put the...
[01:02:50.239 --> 01:03:01.360]  Put the gear on, folks, and get ready and take the gloves off because the New World Order is, and after Martin leaves us, I got a bunch of clips, CNN, MSNBC, you name it.
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:03.500]  They say, oh, the deep state, save us.
[01:03:03.539 --> 01:03:07.059]  They actually say, yeah, the deep state's real and agencies, governments, save us.
[01:03:07.139 --> 01:03:17.380]  No, we elected him to stop you criminals starting World War III and running the country on the ground and human trafficking little kids, you damn lunatics, and your frickin' lockdowns and all of it.
[01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:19.909]  I mean, look, you know you're in a real war.
[01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:23.010]  You're the ones who want to throw us all in prison and want to be totalitarians.
[01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:25.030]  You know what happens to people that try this crap?
[01:03:26.449 --> 01:03:28.210]  I mean, you know what happens, right?
[01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:31.449]  Most of the time, you're going to get in big trouble.
[01:03:32.469 --> 01:03:32.789]  Okay?
[01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:37.269]  So I'm going to warn the establishment, and a lot of them already figured it out.
[01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:38.469]  Back off!
[01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.389]  Yeah, we were asleep before.
[01:03:41.389 --> 01:03:43.230]  You could sneak in like a vampire and drink our blood.
[01:03:43.389 --> 01:03:44.489]  We're not asleep now.
[01:03:45.130 --> 01:03:45.650]  Okay?
[01:03:46.269 --> 01:03:49.610]  And there's the light of the midday sun of awakening.
[01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:52.530]  You guys can creep around in the dark all you want.
[01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:54.570]  Get your hands off of us.
[01:03:54.769 --> 01:03:55.550]  You understand?
[01:03:57.650 --> 01:04:00.989]  You think all your bullying and harassment does anything but pisses us off?
[01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:02.889]  You think that stuff works on us?
[01:04:03.050 --> 01:04:04.150]  How's it working out?
[01:04:06.769 --> 01:04:10.090]  If you know what to do, roll over.
[01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:11.150]  Surrender.
[01:04:11.489 --> 01:04:12.469]  Like Zuckerberg.
[01:04:14.079 --> 01:04:14.559]  All right.
[01:04:15.139 --> 01:04:20.619]  Martin Armstrong is a very respected economist and one of the most accurate statisticians out there with his computer models.
[01:04:20.739 --> 01:04:22.059]  He's well known everywhere.
[01:04:22.059 --> 01:04:22.860]  He does an introduction.
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:23.440]  He's here.
[01:04:23.519 --> 01:04:25.639]  We appreciate him on the...
[01:04:27.019 --> 01:04:28.320]  Morning of this great victory.
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.840]  He's here on election and taxes and the future.
[01:04:31.019 --> 01:04:33.579]  Putin has come out and said he's ready to seriously talk with Trump.
[01:04:33.719 --> 01:04:38.719]  He takes Trump seriously and wants to end the beginning of World War III before it gets too out of hand.
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:40.539]  We got the clips of that.
[01:04:41.079 --> 01:04:45.840]  Martin, 35,000 foot view and then just drill into can Trump stabilize things?
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:47.699]  What would you do?
[01:04:48.079 --> 01:04:49.920]  I know you're advising some of the Trump folks.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.539]  Is he really about to drain the swamp?
[01:04:52.699 --> 01:04:54.000]  And if so, how do we support him?
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.480]  Martin Armstrong of armstrongeconomics.com.
[01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:56.880]  Thank you, sir.
[01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:59.409]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:06.530]  I think people have to understand, the first time he was there, they picked everybody to go in the cabinet.
[01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:14.210]  And what you had was that they were then, basically, every one of them was stabbing you in the back.
[01:05:14.489 --> 01:05:16.369]  You know, like John Bolton, for example.
[01:05:16.809 --> 01:05:17.349]  Yeah.
[01:05:18.679 --> 01:05:20.219]  He started firing those people.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:23.599]  This time he's bringing in his own people.
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.679]  There is a transition team, etc.
[01:05:27.619 --> 01:05:29.059]  Now he knows the game.
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:31.760]  So it's a little bit different this time than the last time.
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:37.940]  But if you look at, we've published a chart on our site.
[01:05:38.219 --> 01:05:39.920]  You can pretty much Google it.
[01:05:40.179 --> 01:05:50.280]  We've just taken up and allocated all the seats between the House and the Senate, the Democrats and those to Republicans, and plotted it out.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:58.380]  If you look at it just like a normal market, You'd have to see that the Democrats are in a bear market.
[01:05:58.619 --> 01:06:01.980]  The peak was with FDR the first time.
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:07.320]  Every high that they have made ever since is lower and every low is lower.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.139]  Our computer was projected that Trump would win this time.
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:17.000]  And it's never been wrong.
[01:06:17.519 --> 01:06:19.960]  It just goes by the economics.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:23.179]  We're not pulling anybody and it's not my personal opinion.
[01:06:27.069 --> 01:06:33.429]  It's really just basically people will vote on their economic situation.
[01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:41.730]  And look, 40% of the people will always vote Democrat, 40% will always vote Republican.
[01:06:42.110 --> 01:06:46.389]  So it's that slice in between that really makes the difference.
[01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:47.789]  Well, that's right.
[01:06:47.849 --> 01:06:50.929]  I should have gotten the clip, but there's just so many predictions that you make that come true.
[01:06:51.110 --> 01:06:55.530]  You were on, what, two months ago, and you said Trump's going to win 100%.
[01:06:55.530 --> 01:06:56.150]  Yeah.
[01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:59.710]  Look, it's not my opinion, okay?
[01:06:59.769 --> 01:07:07.489]  It's just the computer puts it out, and sometimes I've been surprised, but I think I did a...
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:18.619]  A podcast with Craig Hunter, you know, a week before, I said, look, it's showing the gap is too big for them to fix this time.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:28.059]  So, you know, it's likely to get a clean sweep, or a trifecta as you're calling it.
[01:07:28.599 --> 01:07:34.579]  And Trump had also thrown out Eliminating the income tax.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:39.440]  As you know, I worked on Capitol Hill with Dick Armey and all those down there.
[01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:44.159]  I even debated Steve Forbes at Princeton University and the whole thing.
[01:07:45.219 --> 01:07:47.039]  Couldn't get it through back then.
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:50.480]  But income tax is no longer necessary.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:56.300]  It was necessary when money was physical coins, gold and silver.
[01:07:56.929 --> 01:07:59.650]  The king had to get some back in order to spend it.
[01:07:59.949 --> 01:08:01.309]  Now, we just print.
[01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:04.610]  Why do we even bother with this?
[01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:08.050]  It's not necessary on a federal level.
[01:08:08.809 --> 01:08:10.969]  States fine because they can't create the money.
[01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:17.069]  So, you know, I was very encouraged that- By the way, let's just glaze over that.
[01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:19.010]  I don't want to just glaze over that.
[01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:38.250]  This is a fact that since the 70s, you can even say earlier, I think?
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:52.460]  It is a bowling ball tied to our legs in the middle of the ocean, and it needs to be removed.
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:57.300]  So when they claim Trump will destroy the economy with his economic plan, it is pure horsemen.
[01:08:57.359 --> 01:08:57.960]  Correct, Martin?
[01:08:59.229 --> 01:09:02.989]  Look, I mean, I testified before the House Ways and Means Committee on this.
[01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:06.550]  Why did everybody go to Hong Kong?
[01:09:06.649 --> 01:09:08.630]  Because they had a 15% corporate rate.
[01:09:08.890 --> 01:09:12.289]  I mean, I've advised more multinational companies, I think, than anybody.
[01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:13.470]  I know what moves it.
[01:09:13.930 --> 01:09:23.590]  And I basically said, look, if you eliminate the income tax in the United States, all right, every major corporation is going to try and come here.
[01:09:24.210 --> 01:09:28.010]  And it's a fallacy that we even have a trade deficit.
[01:09:28.109 --> 01:09:35.970]  If you allocate trade according to the company's flag that it actually flies, you'll see the U.S. has a trade surplus.
[01:09:36.649 --> 01:09:44.430]  When you had income taxes in the 60s up to 94%, I mean, you drove everybody offshore.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:49.119]  And, you know, so that's the way it really is.
[01:09:49.239 --> 01:09:54.520]  I mean, if you eliminate that income tax, all that money is going to come pouring into here.
[01:09:55.170 --> 01:09:56.470]  Well, let's quantify that, sir.
[01:09:57.010 --> 01:10:15.050]  The income tax is an internal tariff by the elites against the people because then the general public can't operate any big businesses and then only globalists that are offshore can and make a deal with China and make a deal with other developing countries and then you impoverish and control the American people.
[01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:16.649]  It's a form of economic siege.
[01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:24.689]  But what they also do is the DOJ uses income tax to threaten the media.
[01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:28.369]  You will say what we want you to say or kill this story.
[01:10:28.569 --> 01:10:32.550]  Otherwise, they will end up personally investigating that person.
[01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:35.189]  And it's usually income tax.
[01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:39.430]  Look, Al Capone, how did they put him in?
[01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:40.310]  Income tax.
[01:10:40.829 --> 01:10:44.689]  They couldn't get him on any of the so-called mafia stuff.
[01:10:44.689 --> 01:10:45.750]  It was income tax.
[01:10:46.289 --> 01:10:50.670]  I mean, this is their catch-all phrase.
[01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:55.250]  And basically, they can't put you in prison for not paying the tax.
[01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:57.590]  They put you in prison for not telling them you owe it.
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:08.100]  And to be clear, for those that don't know, and this has been done by all the major financial publications, where they do 30 different CPAs, 50 different CPAs, 30 different tax lawyers.
[01:11:08.279 --> 01:11:13.560]  You all get different answers because it's written so they can put you in prison if they want.
[01:11:13.699 --> 01:11:18.439]  It's a maze that if you're not part of the establishment, they can say you're a criminal.
[01:11:18.619 --> 01:11:20.159]  I mean, no matter how much you pay them.
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:23.979]  Yeah, I mean, look, we advise...
[01:11:25.489 --> 01:11:27.710]  A lot of different governments and central banks.
[01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:30.590]  I don't take any money from any of them, period.
[01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:32.130]  Not even our own.
[01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:40.289]  Reason is because they have a law that says if I take money from any government, then I have to register as an agent for them.
[01:11:42.529 --> 01:11:47.170]  So we don't accept money from any government, period.
[01:11:48.109 --> 01:11:49.310]  Not even our own.
[01:11:50.959 --> 01:12:02.199]  So they have all these different little rigs and clauses when it comes to income tax, and it is detrimental to the economy.
[01:12:07.579 --> 01:12:12.300]  Was basically to eliminate the income tax, eliminate the debt.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:22.800]  You take the debt, you issue coupons, then you would take the coupon, go to Merrill Lynch or whoever, and then you invest it in shares or corporate bonds.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:26.199]  They then take the coupon, go back and redeem it.
[01:12:27.479 --> 01:12:32.500]  Basically get rid of the national debt, governments barred from ever borrowing again.
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:36.699]  Even that theory is pre-Bretton Woods.
[01:12:37.039 --> 01:12:44.340]  It was like, you know, if the money supply cannot increase, then it's less inflationary to borrow than it is to print.
[01:12:44.869 --> 01:12:52.109]  Sure, Martin, most of our audience is very informed and gets it, but we have a lot of uninformed, educated, idiot liberals listening.
[01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:57.130]  For those that don't know, because I've been told not just it's in the news, I've talked to the Trump people.
[01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:59.630]  I know you've been advising Trump for a long time.
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:06.699]  The bottom line here is the big announcement is we're very close to Trump initiating this.
[01:13:06.819 --> 01:13:07.680]  He says he will.
[01:13:07.939 --> 01:13:09.380]  And so that's the big announcement.
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.020]  We're close to getting rid of the income tax.
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:16.239]  We need to get behind that, educate the public on why it is good, why it's a no-brainer, why there's no debate.
[01:13:16.359 --> 01:13:17.699]  That's basically what you're doing here.
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:25.359]  So for the new liberals, and I'm not being mean, it's true, who really are economically ignorant, will you just talk to them like they're five years old?
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:29.880]  Will you explain to them how this works and how it's going to help them?
[01:13:31.069 --> 01:13:37.750]  When you borrow money, all right, up to 70% of the interest that we pay goes offshore.
[01:13:38.289 --> 01:13:42.250]  It's not stimulating the domestic economy, all right?
[01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:50.149]  It's no longer necessary when we don't have physical money, all right?
[01:13:50.289 --> 01:13:53.569]  Why are we borrowing paper dollars that we print anyhow?
[01:13:53.909 --> 01:13:55.210]  I mean, it's nonsense.
[01:13:55.630 --> 01:14:01.220]  Our interest expenditures this year We'll be a trillion dollars more than defense.
[01:14:01.439 --> 01:14:04.760]  Within five years, it's going to consume everything.
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:06.020]  All right?
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:08.380]  You can't constantly keep rolling this.
[01:14:08.699 --> 01:14:12.600]  Now, if we eliminate this, as I'm saying, what happens?
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:18.760]  Interest rates will come down because the government is competing with you for a mortgage, basically.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:23.840]  You're going out to get a 30-year mortgage, and you have to pay more than the government.
[01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:30.949]  All right, so if we eliminate government borrowing at that level, long term interest rates will come down.
[01:14:31.170 --> 01:14:34.010]  They're competing against the private sector for money.
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:40.399]  Well, Martin, I'm not being mean, but it's impossible for you to dumb it down.
[01:14:40.619 --> 01:14:43.819]  So I'm going to dumb it down for you, and then correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.800]  The left thinks everything comes from the government.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.039]  They don't understand that big central banks want us to collapse to fully own us and control us.
[01:14:51.079 --> 01:14:52.340]  We're using it as an economic weapon.
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:53.840]  We're coming to the end of the cycle.
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:58.659]  We have to either get off of it or totally collapse in the globalist great reset and be permanently impoverished.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.180]  You'll own nothing and, quote, be happy in their own words.
[01:15:01.279 --> 01:15:07.199]  A very dystopian Forced austerity, quote, to save the earth but really just to put us under feudalism.
[01:15:07.319 --> 01:15:19.199]  So for the left that wants to have their debts forgiven and their student loans and all this crap, you do that by not having an income tax and basically eliminating most taxes on working people.
[01:15:19.539 --> 01:15:26.340]  And then the middle class explodes, and then diversity in the economy explodes, and then that creates the prosperity.
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:33.180]  Just like Kamala's saying, I'll just make companies sell food for cheaper prices as if they're the ones that cause the inflation.
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:35.579]  And these people hear this like...
[01:15:36.079 --> 01:15:37.100]  We're good to go.
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:58.979]  We're good to go.
[01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:05.270]  A lot of people are just simply brainwashed.
[01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:06.890]  They don't think about it.
[01:16:07.109 --> 01:16:12.869]  If you look at it, 40% of the people will always vote Democrat simply because maybe that's what their parents did.
[01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:15.050]  And they don't ask questions.
[01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:23.100]  Like I said, if you look at Most of the presidents are elected 51, 52, 54%.
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:27.039]  You know, only three presidents ever got 60% or more.
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:29.579]  And that was FDR the first time.
[01:16:29.739 --> 01:16:32.380]  That was Johnson after Kennedy was assassinated.
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:35.220]  And Nixon when he said he was going to take us out of Vietnam.
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:42.739]  So most of them, you know, it's less than 10% of the population that decides who is the president.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.819]  Because they're not looking at issues.
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:50.479]  It's that maybe 20% to give it enough room.
[01:16:51.619 --> 01:16:54.060]  Look at the real facts and make a decision.
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:55.359]  The rest of them do not.
[01:16:56.659 --> 01:16:58.000]  I'm going to tell the left again.
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:02.460]  I think?
[01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:26.090]  Look, this has been going on for thousands of years.
[01:17:26.329 --> 01:17:30.810]  It's even in the Ten Commandments, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods.
[01:17:31.029 --> 01:17:34.409]  So it's been outlawed for a very long time, but they still do it.
[01:17:35.109 --> 01:17:44.970]  I mean, just ask anybody from Eastern Europe or in Russia or China, do they want to go back to communism?
[01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:47.170]  And absolutely no way.
[01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:55.729]  I mean, the propaganda, that's why Putin was so popular, because he wasn't an oligarch and he wasn't a communist.
[01:17:56.170 --> 01:17:58.829]  The people did not want to go back to communism.
[01:17:59.670 --> 01:18:09.430]  And the oligarchs, like Barostinovsky at the time, was just trying to sell everything Russia had to the bankers in New York for the cheapest deal.
[01:18:10.930 --> 01:18:14.750]  Well, Martin, let's get into that because I know you're a geopolitical expert as well.
[01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:17.770]  Putin's reaching out saying he thinks Trump is genuine.
[01:18:18.090 --> 01:18:21.569]  I mean, you have said he thinks Trump's genuine, but they'll just kill him if he does try to end the war.
[01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:23.869]  But the globalists aren't all powerful.
[01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:28.109]  How would you advise Trump on how he should handle the Ukraine situation?
[01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:33.890]  Basically, I mean, I would cut them off, you know.
[01:18:35.869 --> 01:18:42.689]  The problem is NATO is the one that is the retirement home for neocons.
[01:18:42.869 --> 01:18:49.210]  So they've all been moving over there anticipating a possible Trump victory.
[01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:55.810]  And so you had NATO out there trying to raise 100 billion, which didn't go over very well.
[01:18:55.989 --> 01:19:00.409]  And they were calling it to Trump proof to keep the war going against Russia.
[01:19:02.619 --> 01:19:03.420]  They will try.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:21.279]  They're the ones that said, well, we should give the long-range missiles to Zelensky and let him attack Moscow itself so that maybe then Putin will attack anything in NATO. And then they think they can invoke Article 5 and force the United States to go into it.
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.920]  Article 5 is not absolutely mandatory.
[01:19:26.039 --> 01:19:29.279]  You and, you know, Trump can back out of it.
[01:19:29.529 --> 01:19:33.229]  So, I mean, NATO should have been shut down a long time ago.
[01:19:33.909 --> 01:19:38.630]  It was formed basically, you know, when Khrushchev, we will bury you sort of thing.
[01:19:39.449 --> 01:19:42.970]  The days of empire building are long gone.
[01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:48.050]  And you have NATO trying to open up offices in Japan.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:20:02.720]  You know, they're trying, in all honesty, what I've heard from real live sources is that this whole one world government thing with the UN that, you know, Schwab and those are behind.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:08.920]  The IMF and the World Bank would basically form the monetary unit.
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:15.079]  And NATO was to replace the United States as the Department of Defense globally.
[01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:18.649]  This is why they're trying to expand into Asia.
[01:20:18.930 --> 01:20:23.850]  Well, they've officially want NATO as the army of this new one world government.
[01:20:24.050 --> 01:20:25.350]  And you just dropped major hits from people.
[01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:29.420]  People don't know that Stalin kicked the Trotskys out.
[01:20:29.579 --> 01:20:33.079]  The Trotskyites ran to Mexico in the U.S. They took over part of the Republican Party.
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:33.899]  They're the neocons.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.180]  That's mainstream history, folks.
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:42.140]  And then a lot of them are from Ukraine, and they literally are retiring back there with a lot of the stolen money that's being sent there.
[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:48.340]  And they're actually leaving and then trying to put laws in for five more years of funding.
[01:20:49.090 --> 01:20:51.510]  For Ukraine, regardless of where that goes.
[01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:54.510]  And so talk about in a sick way.
[01:20:54.630 --> 01:20:58.310]  That is a victory, though, that actually the neocons are leaving the United States.
[01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:02.539]  Look, I hope they go.
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:06.359]  I know some of them, as you know, I've had dinner with them.
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:08.939]  You do not see a warm light when you look in their eyes.
[01:21:09.039 --> 01:21:09.779]  You just don't.
[01:21:11.319 --> 01:21:15.779]  I know Bill Kristol even spoke at one of our conferences back in the 90s.
[01:21:15.939 --> 01:21:17.979]  His father is the one that started this.
[01:21:19.039 --> 01:21:21.260]  I had arguments with Bill back then.
[01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:30.380]  He said if we remove Saddam Hussein, Assad from Syria and Qaddafi, we would bring peace to the Middle East.
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:32.319]  And I said, you're completely out of your mind.
[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:36.100]  But they're always into this regime change.
[01:21:36.659 --> 01:21:40.479]  As you know, I went head to head with them.
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:48.159]  They wanted me to put in $10 billion back in 2000 to take over for regime change in Russia.
[01:21:49.869 --> 01:21:53.229]  Most people don't realize, but they blackmailed Yeltsin.
[01:21:53.430 --> 01:22:07.869]  They were trying to force him to step down with $7 billion that he took from the IMF. And then you had the communists at the same time filing a motion for impeachment.
[01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:09.909]  That's why he turned to Putin.
[01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:12.130]  Because Putin was neither side.
[01:22:12.329 --> 01:22:15.890]  And his last words to him were, you know, protect Russia.
[01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:18.329]  That's why he was so popular.
[01:22:18.329 --> 01:22:19.850]  He had over 70%.
[01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:20.970]  He's not a dictator.
[01:22:21.149 --> 01:22:21.550]  Sure, Angel.
[01:22:21.630 --> 01:22:23.390]  People don't understand, Martin, like you do.
[01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:24.890]  People are afraid of communism over there.
[01:22:25.369 --> 01:22:25.630]  Sure.
[01:22:25.670 --> 01:22:31.689]  For people that are, I know most listeners get this, but a lot of new listeners are historically and geopolitically illiterate.
[01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:36.149]  The neocons are literally out of Ukraine and Russia.
[01:22:36.409 --> 01:22:37.729]  They got kicked out by Stalin.
[01:22:37.890 --> 01:22:38.529]  They hate Russia.
[01:22:38.689 --> 01:22:40.630]  They tried to go back and take over with the oligarchs.
[01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:41.409]  Putin kicked them out.
[01:22:41.609 --> 01:22:44.029]  Now they started the war in Ukraine in the last decade.
[01:22:45.170 --> 01:22:48.470]  And it's the neocons that are driving all the wars.
[01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:51.329]  They basically run the foreign policy of the Democrats.
[01:22:51.329 --> 01:22:52.850]  That's why Liz Cheney is their darling.
[01:22:53.109 --> 01:22:56.600]  And so when you're identifying them, you're We're not just talking about some old Republicans for no reason.
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:04.800]  You're talking about the brain trust, the evil, quote, geniuses, the Straussians that we're dealing with, and you're identifying them.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:09.140]  I think what I'm getting from you is the neocons are coming to the absolute end of their power.
[01:23:10.699 --> 01:23:11.880]  I hope so.
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:18.220]  They're not going to go out, you know, just quietly into the sunset.
[01:23:18.579 --> 01:23:20.640]  I mean, they have been...
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:24.680]  Look, in the Biden administration, look at what you have.
[01:23:24.739 --> 01:23:36.260]  You have Garland, who claims to have family ties also to the Ukrainian area, saying that Russia persecuted his family.
[01:23:36.939 --> 01:23:39.800]  Victoria Nuland, same thing, okay?
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:51.739]  I mean, and Blinken, all three of them have uniquely ties to that area with their heritage from their family.
[01:23:51.859 --> 01:23:52.680]  Stay there, Martin.
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:53.579]  I want to get more into this.
[01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:55.460]  How did three of them end up in the Biden administration?
[01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:57.050]  Martin, stay there.
[01:23:57.109 --> 01:23:58.170]  Let's do a few more minutes on the other side.
[01:23:58.270 --> 01:23:59.569]  Finish up on this and then end the economy.
[01:23:59.670 --> 01:24:00.770]  What else do you think Trump should do?
[01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:02.090]  What do you think the bad guys are going to pull?
[01:24:02.210 --> 01:24:03.250]  What we can be looking for?
[01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:05.010]  The markets here in the United States.
[01:24:05.289 --> 01:24:05.930]  Stay right there.
[01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:07.510]  But he just nailed it.
[01:24:07.869 --> 01:24:11.289]  I mean, you know, like, a bunch of the administration are Ukrainians.
[01:24:11.409 --> 01:24:13.489]  And they go back to Trotskyites.
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:14.619]  Okay.
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:18.359]  And then a bunch of them also go back to Nazis before that in World War II. You can't make this up.
[01:24:18.359 --> 01:24:26.920]  And you got the vice prime minister up in Canada, who's the co-chair of the WEF. She is the daughter of a top Ukrainian Nazi.
[01:24:27.119 --> 01:24:28.699]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[01:24:28.779 --> 01:24:31.399]  I mean, they act like villains because, I mean, they're villains, folks.
[01:24:31.579 --> 01:24:32.199]  We'll be right back.

[01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:35.649]  Alright, I say this because people need to recognize it.
[01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:42.380]  We're good to go.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.979]  The Tea Party was get rid of the Federal Reserve, have low taxes, control the border.
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:25:57.979]  I'm all for that.
[01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:07.319]  But we educated about the neocons, the New World Order, and the plan for the global government, the plan for the UN to take over our lives and have a global vaccine passport decades ago.
[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:08.560]  It's been on the drawing boards.
[01:26:08.659 --> 01:26:09.539]  Now they're trying it.
[01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:12.149]  And so I was like, well, the Tea Party's great people.
[01:26:12.289 --> 01:26:16.310]  I'll just wake them up to the New World Order, and then, boom, you see what happens.
[01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:19.930]  So Ron Paul did the economics in areas.
[01:26:20.649 --> 01:26:23.409]  He recognizes that by the enemy publications.
[01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:25.369]  There's literally college courses taught on this.
[01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:25.770]  Look it up.
[01:26:26.409 --> 01:26:28.470]  Like a double-headed dragon is how they see us.
[01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:29.329]  They see us as bad guys.
[01:26:29.489 --> 01:26:32.970]  And then I'm over here about the globalists, the New World Order, and the technicals, and their master plans.
[01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:40.489]  And then you've got all the great economists like Martin Armstrong and others out there exposing and educating leaders, both corporate and governmental.
[01:26:41.149 --> 01:26:45.569]  And so, and I say this not about credit, it's so people understand game time.
[01:26:46.149 --> 01:27:02.569]  I would probably have more viewers today and listeners if I just showed clips of the left throwing fits and freaking out and acting like babies and attacking people and You know, just going crazy and them crying last night when Kamala did a Hillary and hid,
[01:27:02.810 --> 01:27:04.250]  which isn't even getting covered.
[01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:06.689]  That's unprecedented other than Hillary doing it.
[01:27:07.989 --> 01:27:10.489]  That's all fun and games, okay?
[01:27:11.229 --> 01:27:27.529]  We're talking about the neocons that are the brain of the left that are setting up the police state, setting up the UN takeover, setting up the biomedical tyranny, setting up World War III, getting the executive order signed for martial law and calling the military out that Trump didn't do,
[01:27:27.670 --> 01:27:31.449]  that the current administration with 74 days left inauguration has set up.
[01:27:31.489 --> 01:27:33.550]  They didn't set all that up for no reason.
[01:27:34.050 --> 01:27:39.149]  They could stage some major false flags and still try to keep Trump from getting in by doing false flags and blaming his supporters.
[01:27:39.850 --> 01:27:42.949]  So, if you think we're out of the woods, folks, you got anything coming.
[01:27:43.029 --> 01:27:50.470]  So, I'm not going to sit here and make fun of the left, and those are their zombies.
[01:27:50.609 --> 01:27:52.210]  Those are the victims of the mind control.
[01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:56.289]  Those are victims, fellow countrymen that fell to this virus, this mind virus.
[01:27:56.810 --> 01:27:57.170]  Okay?
[01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:57.670]  Okay.
[01:27:58.529 --> 01:28:02.329]  I'm trying to get to you, the most active, smart people, to understand.
[01:28:02.489 --> 01:28:04.090]  I know most of you get this, but some don't.
[01:28:05.630 --> 01:28:09.250]  We just won a major battle, but the war is not won yet.
[01:28:09.649 --> 01:28:14.689]  Now, the enemy is starting to build backups and move to bunkers.
[01:28:15.489 --> 01:28:17.789]  Big tech, the neocons, that's all good.
[01:28:18.029 --> 01:28:19.970]  They're showing signs they know they've lost.
[01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:25.989]  But they are still entertaining global crises to try to catapult themselves back into power.
[01:28:25.989 --> 01:28:32.409]  If they're not identified, if they're not exposed and their plans spotlighted, they will try them.
[01:28:33.670 --> 01:28:37.390]  Now, exposure, from my experience, they don't like.
[01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:41.689]  Because then their own people get decompartmentalized who aren't completely evil and then blow the whistle.
[01:28:41.930 --> 01:28:44.710]  So our enemies are very...
[01:28:46.239 --> 01:28:55.699]  Weak right now, they are off balance, and I suggest we finish them politically, culturally, by totally exposing them and then ostracizing them.
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:00.819]  We don't need to run around and hang them upside down like Mussolini in the middle of Rome.
[01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:07.890]  Going back to Martin Armstrong, Martin, you're just dropping major historic bombshells here, but I think for some people they kind of glaze over it.
[01:29:08.050 --> 01:29:09.569]  What do you think of what I just said?
[01:29:09.829 --> 01:29:11.810]  How do we stop the neocons?
[01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:14.069]  As you know, they're the brain trust of the neoliberals.
[01:29:14.949 --> 01:29:20.229]  What is your advice to Trump and his supporters about what we should do to secure this victory?
[01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:23.630]  Do you have my same concerns of the bad guys doing Hail Marys?
[01:29:25.289 --> 01:29:39.270]  Well, I think our computer, which has been really phenomenal, it's showing that we are going to have rising civil unrest, particularly going through December into January.
[01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:47.270]  I don't think these people are just simply going to walk away into the sunset and say, okay, fine, you won.
[01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:51.789]  This has been an unprecedented election.
[01:29:52.029 --> 01:30:02.189]  They've called Trump supporters everything from deplorables, Nazis, and then what Biden called as the last one was garbage.
[01:30:03.010 --> 01:30:06.729]  You can't insult half the country like this.
[01:30:07.409 --> 01:30:15.409]  But they've been staging this coup and they think that they can Force their agenda upon everybody.
[01:30:15.829 --> 01:30:21.250]  And that's just not the way democracy is supposed to work or civilization.
[01:30:22.210 --> 01:30:30.689]  Civilization functions only when everybody benefits, not when one side says it's now my turn to oppress the other.
[01:30:30.909 --> 01:30:32.289]  I mean, this is absurd.
[01:30:32.489 --> 01:30:55.390]  But I am concerned that we're going to be looking at very significant Civil unrest, what I have heard is that they are trying to plan a staged protest in Washington in January that would be so outrageous that they were forced to be calling in the National Guard.
[01:30:55.789 --> 01:31:01.029]  And then they want to turn and say, see, Trump is, you know, he's a dictator.
[01:31:01.489 --> 01:31:03.670]  I mean, so they're going to keep this up.
[01:31:04.189 --> 01:31:10.489]  They're going to try and do the same thing they did during his last administration, block every single action he takes.
[01:31:10.710 --> 01:31:15.310]  But if we have the House and the Senate, that's going to be much more difficult.
[01:31:15.869 --> 01:31:27.729]  So they have been focusing more on NATO and to basically take NATO to create World War III over there and try to drag us in on that basis.
[01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:32.489]  But these people are...
[01:31:33.819 --> 01:31:34.659]  I don't know.
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:37.899]  Like I said, I know some of them.
[01:31:37.979 --> 01:31:47.260]  I just think that they got psychologically damaged from the 50s when we all had to hide underneath our desks for air raids and stuff.
[01:31:48.939 --> 01:31:49.739]  I don't know.
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:56.399]  I guess maybe it just psychologically really affected those people because it's just...
[01:31:57.229 --> 01:31:59.449]  They've been obsessed with Russia.
[01:31:59.750 --> 01:32:01.949]  You can look on YouTube.
[01:32:01.970 --> 01:32:05.149]  You had Robert McNamara before he died.
[01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:07.210]  He did a video and a book.
[01:32:07.529 --> 01:32:09.489]  And he took us into Vietnam.
[01:32:09.949 --> 01:32:15.989]  And he said, look, we went into Vietnam because he thought Russia was there.
[01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:20.789]  And then he apologized and he said, sorry, you know, we were wrong.
[01:32:21.149 --> 01:32:23.630]  OK, but it's always been about Russia.
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:26.619]  So this is what we're looking at.
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:28.760]  And I would be very concerned.
[01:32:28.979 --> 01:32:36.779]  We're not out of the woods yet because they're just not going to walk away into the sunset peacefully.
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:43.420]  They have created an awful lot of people that have just...
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:45.520]  This has been a hate fest.
[01:32:46.159 --> 01:32:50.899]  I know one person here in Florida who was the campaign manager for...
[01:32:53.599 --> 01:33:03.100]  Luna, you know, the local, you know, representative here, and she was just standing in line at a pole and she was, you know, physically attacked by someone.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:06.960]  You know, it's just, this is just not acceptable.
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:13.119]  But you have people who have been completely, I think, mentally attacked.
[01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:30.170]  And Martin, let me just back up what you say, because everything you say, I've done deep research, you're just saying, and I know it's all true, that the Democrats, run by Senator Blumenthal, have put in a bill that's sitting there that when President Trump is president, he will be barred from calling out the military domestically,
[01:33:30.170 --> 01:33:31.590]  which is a legislative...
[01:33:35.859 --> 01:33:39.720]  We're good to go.
[01:33:51.390 --> 01:33:59.930]  And then all they need is some false flags, like this latest FBI plot where they tried to get this lunatic white supremacist to shoot up, you know, black people and blow up a power station.
[01:33:59.930 --> 01:34:02.029]  And they admit they handled the guy, they wound him up.
[01:34:02.630 --> 01:34:06.590]  Well, I mean, I would expect more of that to be the excuse.
[01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:09.289]  And it's the OC, Trump supporters, or Hitler.
[01:34:11.029 --> 01:34:11.590]  Oh, yeah.
[01:34:11.729 --> 01:34:13.630]  I mean, look, I mean, this is...
[01:34:13.630 --> 01:34:16.989]  It's all a campaign to paint it in that direction.
[01:34:18.569 --> 01:34:19.890]  You know, the whole...
[01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:27.029]  As you know, I mean, I was involved in the attempted coup of Russia back in 2000.
[01:34:27.069 --> 01:34:29.029]  They tried to drag me into that.
[01:34:29.470 --> 01:34:35.430]  And that's why Hillary said that, you know, she lost the election.
[01:34:35.649 --> 01:34:43.170]  She claimed that, oh, Putin interfered because she thought that was retaliation because that's what they were doing to Russia back in 2000.
[01:34:43.850 --> 01:34:44.329]  Yeah.
[01:34:45.029 --> 01:34:50.090]  You know, when she was asked, oh, well, why did Russia, did Putin interfere?
[01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:52.449]  Oh, because I had said he rigged some election.
[01:34:52.710 --> 01:34:54.550]  You know, that was nonsense.
[01:34:54.810 --> 01:35:04.590]  It was that, you know, it was, I was asked to put in $10 billion and they were going to stick in Boris Barisnovsky to replace Yeltsin and would have controlled Russia.
[01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:06.289]  That's what they were- Absolutely.
[01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:08.210]  And then yesterday- It's the same thing today.
[01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:15.430]  And then yesterday, if the gas brakes or the election machines in conservative areas don't work in Arizona, the Russians did that.
[01:35:15.609 --> 01:35:18.069]  And even the FBI would admit no evidence of that.
[01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:20.449]  They just, if you slip on a banana peel, the Russians did it.
[01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:30.189]  Yeah, look, I mean, this is, you know, they want to basically present that because Trump is anti-war.
[01:35:31.359 --> 01:35:39.600]  I mean, look, I was pushing RFK to join Trump because I knew also he was anti-war.
[01:35:40.279 --> 01:35:42.039]  But most people didn't know.
[01:35:42.239 --> 01:35:47.800]  But back in 2016, Trump had offered him a commission on vaccines.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:50.600]  And he took it.
[01:35:50.699 --> 01:35:53.300]  So I knew there was a connection between the two.
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:36:10.399]  But I also knew that Pfizer and the rest of them, from what I believe took place, was that they were threatening people in Congress to cut off any funding from them if this commission went through.
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:15.039]  So it was shut down about three to six months before the COVID vaccine.
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:20.779]  So, you know, that's why I was pushing the two of them to get together.
[01:36:21.239 --> 01:36:22.399]  I mean...
[01:36:22.399 --> 01:36:23.159]  Absolutely.
[01:36:23.239 --> 01:36:25.039]  It came out the UN had meetings.
[01:36:25.739 --> 01:36:27.399]  The UN had meetings in Helsinki.
[01:36:29.319 --> 01:36:37.760]  Right before that, saying that the world was waking up to them and they needed something to get people back on board, and then of course they provided it, but now that's blown up even bigger than their face.
[01:36:37.939 --> 01:36:39.420]  In closing, what do you see?
[01:36:39.619 --> 01:36:41.539]  Obviously the markets are way up on the Trump victory.
[01:36:41.899 --> 01:36:44.000]  What do you see short-term, mid-term, long-term?
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:45.239]  Where is the world economy?
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:54.619]  Because it looks to me like even though Trump's got good policies, he's being handed a pretty bad situation, isn't he?
[01:36:56.549 --> 01:36:57.069]  Yes.
[01:36:57.310 --> 01:37:01.170]  I mean, look, globally, we're looking at a recession into 2028.
[01:37:01.970 --> 01:37:05.510]  That's going to be much worse in Europe than here.
[01:37:05.649 --> 01:37:10.029]  Trump, I think, can limit any kind of downside here.
[01:37:10.109 --> 01:37:16.710]  And I would push basically for the whole thing as far as tax reform here.
[01:37:16.770 --> 01:37:23.029]  If we can do that and get that actually through, if we have a majority of both houses, we've got a shot.
[01:37:24.689 --> 01:37:31.350]  But, I mean, like I said, I worked on that with Dick Armey and everybody back in the 90s.
[01:37:32.170 --> 01:37:36.909]  But it was difficult to get, you know, Bill Archer was for a retail sales tax.
[01:37:37.149 --> 01:37:39.170]  Dick Armey was for the flat tax.
[01:37:39.869 --> 01:37:40.350]  And...
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:45.560]  You know, Dick, I was sitting in his office and he said to me, he says, look, you know cycles.
[01:37:45.939 --> 01:37:51.899]  If we, you know, can't repeal the 16th Amendment, when the Democrats get back, we'll have both.
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:54.000]  And I said, you know, Dick, you're absolutely right.
[01:37:54.859 --> 01:38:06.760]  So we need something different than just simply, you know, we're not going to be able to repeal the 16th Amendment because that requires You know, every state to also ratify.
[01:38:06.939 --> 01:38:08.420]  You're not going to get that.
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:14.699]  I'm sure you know that if we do a con-con, they can put a bunch of other bad stuff in at the same time.
[01:38:14.819 --> 01:38:15.659]  Con-cons are dangerous.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:23.119]  Yeah, we're going to have to, you know, look at this seriously and try and push it.
[01:38:23.199 --> 01:38:25.279]  And I think we have a good shot that...
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:30.380]  You know, we can hold on to this type of a position.
[01:38:30.579 --> 01:38:37.060]  If the economy does well, then we can hold on to it in 26 for the midterms.
[01:38:37.619 --> 01:38:39.600]  That's basically what I'm looking at.
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:44.640]  But expect, you know, civil unrest to rise, particularly going into January.
[01:38:44.979 --> 01:38:46.359]  They're not going to give up.
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:49.939]  We're going to have to defend these victories.
[01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:56.869]  But like I said, if you look at the charts we published, The Democratic Party is in a decline.
[01:38:57.470 --> 01:39:03.569]  And our computer projects that it will most likely completely collapse.
[01:39:04.590 --> 01:39:15.510]  This agenda of Marxism, you know, it was the first time it got FDR elected, but it has been dwindling ever since.
[01:39:15.770 --> 01:39:19.010]  And plus, Russia and China have fallen on that theory.
[01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:23.609]  So, you know, the Democrats are going to have to come back and redo this.
[01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:36.930]  I mean, that's our model, which showed strikingly this time, you know, two of them were at 61% and 59%, which is the first time I've seen that, and I've been running this model for 40 years.
[01:39:37.609 --> 01:39:43.949]  So it showed that we had a good enough lead that it was too big for them to fix this time.
[01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:49.229]  Martin Armstrong, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:39:49.869 --> 01:39:51.890]  ArmstrongEconomics.com, what a historic time.
[01:39:52.050 --> 01:39:52.750]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:39:53.630 --> 01:39:56.090]  Well, thank you for inviting me, and take care, Alex.
[01:39:56.689 --> 01:39:56.989]  Take care.
[01:39:58.109 --> 01:40:02.390]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am very sober, as you can notice.
[01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:04.170]  I get it.
[01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:05.409]  People deserve to be celebrating.
[01:40:05.609 --> 01:40:08.590]  I'm not judging people that are celebrating.
[01:40:08.689 --> 01:40:12.909]  We just heard Martin Armstrong, and he's a very respected economist and really historian.
[01:40:13.890 --> 01:40:17.010]  And a lot of world leaders listen to him, and he just told you what I'm telling you.
[01:40:17.770 --> 01:40:19.850]  They are getting ready to stage false flags.
[01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:36.199]  We're in the 70-something days, and they are getting ready to try to have an uprising, as Carvel said, and as others said, and they are so deflated, and all of their election fraud didn't work.
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:44.000]  They mitigated the win in the House and Senate, but It's a paradox.
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:46.399]  Yes, we have crushed them.
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:47.279]  You know, Owen was...
[01:40:47.279 --> 01:40:56.720]  I'll answer Owen's question that he's going to be getting to when he comes up in the last half of the next hour with all the graphs and the House and Senate, mainly House fights that aren't over yet.
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:58.979]  We've got to watch so carefully because that's where they really...
[01:40:58.979 --> 01:41:06.539]  In the last few midterms and general elections, you do some stealing there at the end and the Republicans lose a lot of their majority in the House or lose the House completely.
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:09.520]  I'm not saying that's going to happen, but Owen's like...
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:10.979]  We've got to ask, why did Trump...
[01:41:12.619 --> 01:41:15.560]  Do better in these states than the down-ballot candidates.
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:18.479]  And...
[01:41:18.479 --> 01:41:34.020]  That's because a lot of people were just checking to see if they had Trump checked and then those ballots got manipulated later because they know there's less attention on those.
[01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:37.619]  And there was a lot of election fraud going on.
[01:41:38.319 --> 01:41:39.000]  So...
[01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:50.609]  Again, this was a giant landslide, but the wall of fraud, the seawall of fraud, the blue wall, was a big seawall.
[01:41:50.710 --> 01:41:53.010]  So this giant tsunami comes in, but only part of it went over.
[01:41:53.170 --> 01:42:01.510]  And you could call it a decent win, a baby landslide, but it was a big landslide in reality.
[01:42:01.689 --> 01:42:05.590]  And Trump got the popular vote and the Electoral College.
[01:42:07.530 --> 01:42:09.090]  So, this is a mandate.
[01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:11.369]  This is a major repudiation.
[01:42:12.670 --> 01:42:15.810]  And it's like a child that you love.
[01:42:16.289 --> 01:42:19.329]  And your wife's pregnant, nine months, have the baby, take care of it.
[01:42:19.409 --> 01:42:21.250]  Now the child's five years old.
[01:42:22.289 --> 01:42:27.470]  And maybe your child got really sick when they were three and almost died, but it got better.
[01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:33.770]  And so you won that battle, but let's say your child, God forbid, at five is in a car wreck.
[01:42:35.039 --> 01:42:36.720]  That's another crisis.
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:38.159]  That's another issue.
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:41.539]  Because life is a war.
[01:42:42.739 --> 01:42:44.319]  And everything is a struggle.
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:45.920]  That's what makes us strong.
[01:42:46.279 --> 01:42:50.300]  And this is the biggest victory since 1776.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:54.460]  Since we won that war, years after that.
[01:42:56.319 --> 01:43:08.199]  But for the whole world now, it's way more important because of the geopolitical issues and the globalists that have captured America using American power to set up this purely evil, anti-human global government.
[01:43:08.359 --> 01:43:11.000]  So this affects the entire planet at a massive level.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:11.939]  And I know you know that.
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:21.640]  But with Elon Musk saying the UN's criminal and unelected and the WF's criminal and elected and the New World Order's bad and global government's our enemy, that's the big corporations.
[01:43:22.319 --> 01:43:23.260]  That's BlackRock.
[01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:30.300]  That's the people that are programming the culture and that want to break up the family and make us weak and control our bodies and poison us.
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:35.119]  So this is a big deal.
[01:43:35.319 --> 01:43:38.819]  And again, I know most of you get that, but for the new listeners...
[01:43:39.949 --> 01:43:58.729]  If you had any, and I'm talking about leftists out there, I know you watch, if you had any real economic, cultural, historical understanding, if you were not illiterate, you would understand that we're trying to just save ourselves and you along with us.
[01:43:58.869 --> 01:44:01.050]  I mean, I'm not Hitler.
[01:44:01.329 --> 01:44:02.090]  Trump's not Hitler.
[01:44:02.909 --> 01:44:05.869]  I'm a liberal, like Thomas Jefferson.
[01:44:06.619 --> 01:44:09.439]  Now, that's the opposite of what you are.
[01:44:09.619 --> 01:44:10.840]  You're not a liberal.
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:18.619]  Liberals are for more freedom, maximum human freedom and mobility.
[01:44:18.739 --> 01:44:21.539]  You guys want to control what everybody does.
[01:44:21.539 --> 01:44:22.319]  You're a cult.
[01:44:22.939 --> 01:44:25.199]  You're the one censoring, not us.
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.399]  And that's the reality.
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:43.460]  And your assault on reality is no longer working and not facing the fundamentals of the global political realignment and just turning the BS up even higher just took it to cartoon-esque levels.
[01:44:44.979 --> 01:44:58.979]  So we have an opportunity here, not with the really bad guys because they're never going to stop, but with a lot of their minions and people and even some high-powered ones to say, listen, Why don't you just join Team Humanity?
[01:45:00.239 --> 01:45:02.979]  Why don't you try getting on your knees to God and repenting?
[01:45:04.359 --> 01:45:09.939]  If there's still good left in you, I want you to know that I don't want to enslave you.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:10.840]  I don't want to kill you.
[01:45:11.239 --> 01:45:12.739]  I don't want to run your life.
[01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:14.979]  You can do what you want in your life.
[01:45:15.119 --> 01:45:16.539]  Just don't do it in mine.
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:17.739]  You understand that?
[01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:20.359]  Stay away from my children.
[01:45:22.439 --> 01:45:25.020]  Stay away from my freedom.
[01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:31.619]  And understand that I'm sorry that my culture is the best.
[01:45:31.979 --> 01:45:33.979]  I'm sorry that my ideas are the best.
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:40.699]  I'm sorry you feel like losers and hate everybody, and so you want to bring society down with you.
[01:45:40.819 --> 01:45:43.380]  We're just not going to let you do it without a fight.
[01:45:43.779 --> 01:45:47.840]  And if you keep turning the heat up, you're the ones that are escalating with this stuff.
[01:45:48.199 --> 01:45:51.279]  I have no desire to smash you.
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:53.079]  But we will.
[01:45:53.659 --> 01:45:58.920]  And I think you figured out by now, I'm talking to the globalists themselves as well, that we're not playing around.
[01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:01.020]  Alright?
[01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:04.159]  I fundamentally believe in humanity.
[01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:05.600]  I've bet on humanity.
[01:46:06.260 --> 01:46:13.340]  And I am simply pointing out who we really are and asking people to stand up and be who God made them.
[01:46:13.579 --> 01:46:14.680]  And we will win.
[01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:22.079]  And you look at the people that follow Satan, you look at the satanic system, I mean, these are a pack of losers.
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:23.520]  Come on, people.
[01:46:23.659 --> 01:46:24.340]  Stop serving it.
[01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:25.439]  It's gonna destroy us all.
[01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:28.500]  Now, we're gonna go to break.
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:30.560]  I've got all these clips, all this insanity.
[01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:33.479]  I mean, these are incredible clips.
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.380]  I should have got to it right at the start of the show, but I haven't.
[01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:36.960]  I mean, I've got like dozens of them.
[01:46:38.539 --> 01:46:39.560]  This is all wild.
[01:46:39.739 --> 01:46:40.640]  It's all very important.
[01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:44.800]  A lot of it's them capitulating, and then the other one's just saying, no, we're in our restaurant.
[01:46:44.819 --> 01:46:45.960]  The deep state will save us.
[01:46:47.279 --> 01:46:48.420]  I'll get you next time.
[01:46:49.779 --> 01:46:50.399]  Villain stuff.
[01:46:51.239 --> 01:46:53.199]  So, this is important.
[01:46:53.319 --> 01:46:54.100]  It's all coming up.
[01:46:55.260 --> 01:47:04.430]  Now, you really want to go to thealexjonesstore.com Because we've got all the new Trump One shirts.
[01:47:05.409 --> 01:47:12.869]  And unlike other companies and other places, when the Alex Jones store says they've got it, it's not going to be made in two weeks.
[01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:18.729]  Like with InfoWars, we'd put something up and say two-week wait because we didn't own the factory.
[01:47:18.890 --> 01:47:20.149]  These guys have the factory.
[01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:21.789]  It's all being made in Arkansas.
[01:47:23.229 --> 01:47:26.710]  And so when it goes up on the site, I mean, I asked for a hat.
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:33.000]  Monday, no, no, yeah, no, Sunday, and Tuesday morning, it was on my desk.
[01:47:33.119 --> 01:47:35.260]  This one right here, Trashy American.
[01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:41.899]  I said, I want a red hat, red and white hat, trucker hat with Trashy American in this font, white font with a black line around it.
[01:47:41.979 --> 01:47:46.500]  It was on my desk Tuesday morning when I got here at 8 a.m., I mean, boom.
[01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:49.020]  So I said, hey, I want a hat with fluoride.
[01:47:49.119 --> 01:47:50.039]  There's poison in the tap water.
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:53.239]  We put this out before Trump came out and said he's going to ban it.
[01:47:53.699 --> 01:47:54.920]  Great to educate people.
[01:47:55.159 --> 01:47:56.000]  Great looking hat.
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:47:58.159]  We've got all the murdered out MAGA hats.
[01:47:58.500 --> 01:47:59.880]  And Make America Great Again.
[01:48:00.279 --> 01:48:01.899]  These are really kick-ass hats.
[01:48:02.539 --> 01:48:03.279]  Go get them.
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:11.920]  They're at thealexjonesstore.com and there's a lot of new amazing t-shirts.
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:25.520]  The Trump 2024 shirts, the Trump Rocky shirt, back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back champ.
[01:48:25.699 --> 01:48:27.180]  That's right, he won all three times.
[01:48:27.579 --> 01:48:28.859]  They just stole the middle one.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:35.680]  The ultimate comeback, celebrate it, wear it, back-to-back, back-to-back, Trump champ.
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:37.680]  Trump won, that's a really good-looking shirt.
[01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:41.699]  And then you spread the word about the broadcast at AlexJones.com.
[01:48:41.979 --> 01:48:43.739]  I love that red one, Trump one.
[01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:46.460]  I mean, these are with the American eagle up there.
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:48.920]  I guess you'd say the eagle rampant.
[01:48:50.119 --> 01:48:53.159]  Today is your Independence Day, 11-20-25.
[01:48:54.399 --> 01:48:56.220]  Oh yeah, that's the real date right there.
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:58.239]  The battle was won.
[01:48:58.340 --> 01:49:02.640]  Now the war will be, for that phase of it, won on the 20th.
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:05.159]  They're all there at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:49:05.779 --> 01:49:08.399]  And boy, look at that new red Trump one hat.
[01:49:08.619 --> 01:49:09.739]  That is good looking.
[01:49:09.739 --> 01:49:12.699]  I'm going to call them and say, hey, please put that in the mail to me.
[01:49:13.239 --> 01:49:15.680]  That is, ooh, that is sexy.
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:17.960]  That is classy.
[01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:21.569]  Goodness gracious, Jiminy Crickets.
[01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:23.229]  Landslide, the definition.
[01:49:23.569 --> 01:49:25.510]  An overwhelming majority of votes.
[01:49:25.930 --> 01:49:26.949]  Yeah, put that back up.
[01:49:27.050 --> 01:49:27.430]  Show me that.
[01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:28.109]  That was amazing.
[01:49:28.810 --> 01:49:31.970]  So, perfect time these coming in, because we need the funds.
[01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:34.529]  Infowars will be shut down by next Wednesday.
[01:49:36.010 --> 01:49:37.770]  And we need your support.
[01:49:37.770 --> 01:49:41.130]  So, remember, they take over Infowars and all the rest of it.
[01:49:41.149 --> 01:49:43.270]  You'll find me on X at Real Alex Jones and at...
[01:49:55.579 --> 01:49:56.939]  They're coming after everybody.
[01:49:56.939 --> 01:49:57.899]  They're coming after Trump.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:58.720]  They're coming after Kennedy.
[01:49:58.979 --> 01:49:59.859]  We need your support.
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:00.859]  And you don't even come here and do this.
[01:50:00.970 --> 01:50:02.329]  Alex, first of all, I want to thank you.
[01:50:02.409 --> 01:50:03.409]  Give it to Alex Jones.
[01:50:03.609 --> 01:50:08.770]  I don't want this guy to have to be like wearing a symbol and we're all going to say, you know, the truth teller formerly known as Alex Jones.
[01:50:08.869 --> 01:50:10.029]  Let's not let that happen.
[01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:11.789]  Well, they're trying to make an example out of me.
[01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:14.770]  I'm not that important, but I've become a rallying point.
[01:50:14.930 --> 01:50:17.130]  I've become like a Roman standard they want to capture.
[01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:17.789]  Explain that.
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:27.220]  Look, I mean, if we don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the First Amendment, if, you know, media, which is, look, it never said only newspapers or the media.
[01:50:27.399 --> 01:50:36.239]  It was anyone that wants to challenge government, anyone that's willing to put the feet to the fire of corporate interests of your government, that is supposed to be free.
[01:50:36.439 --> 01:50:37.420]  Electronic soapbox.
[01:50:37.619 --> 01:50:37.619]  Yeah.
[01:50:37.659 --> 01:50:41.640]  In the end, if you lose, Alex, we all lose.
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:47.640]  We will all lose the ability to do tough stories, to take risks, to plant flags where we think there's an issue.
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:48.880]  Sometime we'll get it wrong.
[01:50:49.039 --> 01:50:50.939]  I said before, you do a daily show.
[01:50:51.119 --> 01:50:52.840]  It's impossible to nail that to the wall.
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:53.880]  I do a weekly show.
[01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:55.420]  I spend more time vetting it.
[01:50:55.539 --> 01:50:56.420]  They're two different animals.
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:57.399]  They can't be compared.
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:58.939]  They also take stuff out of context.
[01:50:59.119 --> 01:50:59.579]  I'm exaggerating.
[01:50:59.819 --> 01:51:00.920]  Absolutely, that's true.
[01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:09.579]  You know, one of the things that makes you so spectacular, Alex, is long before any of us were here, You were starting to talk about this deep state.
[01:51:09.779 --> 01:51:21.159]  You were talking about this, you know, a government that was supposed to be of, for, and by the people that was being robbed from us by corporate interests, by special interests, by globalists, long before anybody else ever did.
[01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:26.680]  And to imagine you sitting here in this moment, we are in that impactful moment.
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:28.960]  And in many ways, not enough people are listening to you.
[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:44.560]  And I want to say that, you know, I think the vaccine, and we've talked about this before, that was the tip of the spear of the final death blow, which was, if we can inject you and own your bodies, and own the bodies of your children, and pass laws that say that, you know, because of vaccinations,
[01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:46.539]  we've decided that we own your children.
[01:51:46.699 --> 01:51:47.539]  We make your decisions.
[01:51:47.579 --> 01:51:48.979]  That's a revolutionary takeover.
[01:51:49.010 --> 01:51:57.770]  It was a revolutionary takeover, and so people like me got alarmed by that, and we joined forces with people like you that have been really talking about it for a long time.
[01:51:57.909 --> 01:52:00.829]  But I would say that we're at the very last stage.
[01:52:00.890 --> 01:52:04.930]  I was just speaking publicly, and this woman said, things don't happen that fast, Dale.
[01:52:05.050 --> 01:52:05.909]  You're being really dramatic.
[01:52:05.909 --> 01:52:08.270]  I don't think this election matters that much.
[01:52:08.409 --> 01:52:12.810]  I was like, that's because you're looking at this over the last year, maybe two years.
[01:52:12.989 --> 01:52:23.109]  There's people like Bobby that's been fighting the corporate establishment for four 40 years as a lawyer that watched his father when he was 13 years old be killed for exactly this battle.
[01:52:23.210 --> 01:52:23.750]  And his uncle.
[01:52:24.130 --> 01:52:26.029]  And his uncle when he was 10 years old.
[01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:38.130]  So depending on what window you look at this, we're really at the end stage of a takeover and destruction of the one thing that stands in the way of globalist thinking, which is the Constitution of the United States of America.
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:40.500]  They're doing all these lawsuits trying to take my name.
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:41.319]  People say they can't do that.
[01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:42.319]  Well, I gotta defend those.
[01:52:42.479 --> 01:52:43.119]  We're gonna win.
[01:52:43.239 --> 01:52:43.720]  We're already winning.
[01:52:43.819 --> 01:52:44.899]  The judge shut them down last week.
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:48.859]  That took high-powered lawyers and that, you know, 50 grand right there to have those briefs ready, okay?
[01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:50.159]  This is total war.
[01:52:50.380 --> 01:52:51.199]  We make it easy.
[01:52:51.279 --> 01:52:53.380]  Great supplements, great t-shirts, great everything.

[01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:02.430]  Incredible supplements, the ultimate CMOS, superfood.
[01:53:02.489 --> 01:53:04.750]  It's all there at the Alex Jones store.
[01:53:05.409 --> 01:53:06.250]  Thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:08.829]  My dad's great supplement company, drjonesnatorals.com.
[01:53:08.930 --> 01:53:10.590]  That's how we're funding this operation.
[01:53:10.729 --> 01:53:14.329]  Separate from InfoWars, you go there, you get t-shirts, you get ball caps.
[01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:15.270]  You spread the word.
[01:53:15.409 --> 01:53:16.369]  You meet light-minded people.
[01:53:16.449 --> 01:53:17.609]  You're a walking billboard for freedom.
[01:53:17.649 --> 01:53:18.470]  It's a great adventure.
[01:53:18.710 --> 01:53:20.170]  And you know you're funding our operation.
[01:53:20.289 --> 01:53:20.930]  We need funds.
[01:53:21.010 --> 01:53:23.090]  And I'll go on the offense and just hope the money comes in.
[01:53:23.149 --> 01:53:24.090]  But we're going on the offense.
[01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.949]  We caught them.
[01:53:24.989 --> 01:53:25.710]  We got the documents.
[01:53:25.810 --> 01:53:28.050]  I told you I'll sue the CIA and FBI. Get ready.
[01:53:28.289 --> 01:53:29.550]  First steps start this week.
[01:53:29.590 --> 01:53:30.350]  And the enemy already knows.
[01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:31.550]  I'm just...
[01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:33.149]  But I need money to do it.
[01:53:33.210 --> 01:53:35.189]  And look, I don't even think about my life or any of that.
[01:53:35.250 --> 01:53:35.770]  That doesn't matter.
[01:53:35.829 --> 01:53:36.510]  I'm on this mission.
[01:53:36.529 --> 01:53:37.069]  I love it.
[01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.609]  This is great.
[01:53:37.890 --> 01:53:40.109]  But I need funds to fight a war.
[01:53:40.789 --> 01:53:41.590]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:53:42.369 --> 01:53:43.189]  DrJonesNatural.com.
[01:53:43.470 --> 01:53:45.369]  Those are the coordinates of the resistance.
[01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:53.590]  It's all there, and it's great products at great prices, highest quality, and it funds the fight against the New World Order that's coming out on us with both damn feet.
[01:53:53.710 --> 01:53:55.510]  But at least we're in the fight, and we're starting to win.
[01:53:55.909 --> 01:53:57.109]  If you want to win...
[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:11.979]  Listen to God and if you've never got on your knees for an hour straight alone and just don't ask God for anything.
[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:17.460]  Just say touch me.
[01:54:18.659 --> 01:54:19.920]  I want to know you.
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:20.920]  Tell me your will.
[01:54:21.699 --> 01:54:22.840]  Thy will be done.
[01:54:22.979 --> 01:54:25.319]  Thy kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.260]  And I've told the crew about this.
[01:54:33.439 --> 01:54:42.380]  And I have done it a couple times for my wife and a few times for my children.
[01:54:45.039 --> 01:54:48.060]  But I only do it when the Spirit tells me to.
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:54.359]  And I just have to clear my mind and then I'm given the answer.
[01:54:55.159 --> 01:54:59.380]  And this happens in a lot of things in a lot of ways.
[01:55:02.209 --> 01:55:16.810]  But when God chooses to do it, and if you'll notice, I've done this other times here and there on the air, I go ahead and say it, and then I'm never wrong.
[01:55:17.949 --> 01:55:22.310]  Sometimes I can interpret it a little bit off, but just a little bit.
[01:55:22.569 --> 01:55:34.050]  So last night, I literally, just like other people described it, You feel a demonic presence, like your skin crawls back, your hair and your neck stands up.
[01:55:34.170 --> 01:55:36.189]  You feel the angel, which is always there.
[01:55:36.989 --> 01:55:39.229]  It's like a warm feeling right behind you.
[01:55:40.130 --> 01:55:45.810]  And then I'm like, oh, it's always there, but God's like saying through the intercessor, okay, I want you to pay attention.
[01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:54.689]  And then when I've not been listening to God because I'm so busy or distracted or get back to thinking I can do it myself subconsciously, God will...
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.439]  I told you about this six months ago.
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:55:59.920]  We got to find the club.
[01:56:00.819 --> 01:56:03.000]  And I just share it so you know how real God is.
[01:56:03.979 --> 01:56:05.619]  Even though I can attack for it.
[01:56:07.159 --> 01:56:09.779]  And this usually happens every few months.
[01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:11.000]  It's been happening to this little kid.
[01:56:12.439 --> 01:56:13.859]  And I know what it was at first.
[01:56:14.899 --> 01:56:16.500]  But I'll wake up.
[01:56:17.489 --> 01:56:23.289]  Or I'll be outside watering plants or something and haven't looked at the clock in hours.
[01:56:24.109 --> 01:56:31.590]  And it's like a direction goes, go in the house and look at the clock.
[01:56:31.810 --> 01:56:33.289]  It's going to be this time.
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:35.800]  And it's always right.
[01:56:36.279 --> 01:56:38.020]  And then I go, what is this?
[01:56:38.159 --> 01:56:39.159]  Why am I being told this?
[01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:40.600]  Because you're not listening.
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:43.399]  And if I can show you that, this is important.
[01:56:44.399 --> 01:56:46.300]  I'm getting your attention that I'm here.
[01:56:46.619 --> 01:56:51.119]  So it's kind of like in Interstellar.
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:53.560]  In fact, it's not kind of like that.
[01:56:53.659 --> 01:56:54.260]  That's what it is.
[01:56:55.359 --> 01:57:04.159]  And, you know, God's been telling me to be more open about this and just to get your attention.
[01:57:05.529 --> 01:57:13.250]  And so last night, I feel the warmth, and I just sit back while Owens and the N.C. are talking to him and I go, okay, what am I supposed to do?
[01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:19.510]  I ask Owen to predict what time Trump will come out and declare victory to the minute.
[01:57:20.949 --> 01:57:22.869]  And I'm like, okay.
[01:57:23.029 --> 01:57:24.449]  And I don't even think about what the next thing is.
[01:57:24.529 --> 01:57:28.409]  And I go, uh, Owen, if you're saying he needs to come out, when do you think he will?
[01:57:30.539 --> 01:57:31.500]  No one's like, I'm not sure.
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:33.840]  And then I just go, well, let me, and you watch it on here.
[01:57:33.899 --> 01:57:34.640]  I'll put the clip and come back.
[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:39.000]  I go, I didn't say four or five numbers.
[01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:41.939]  I said, 127.
[01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:45.239]  He will come on the stage and speak at 127.
[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:50.340]  And then I was like, and they were talking as it was going on.
[01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:51.420]  I was getting more.
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:55.319]  I was like, Eastern, Central?
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.140]  And then we kind of went on to the next thing.
[01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:02.239]  And then, of course, to the second he did that.
[01:58:03.239 --> 01:58:08.060]  Now, I just showed you what I've told you about a lot of other times, but that wasn't just at the time knowing the time.
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:10.460]  That was into the future.
[01:58:12.479 --> 01:58:15.020]  Only that could have been done if it was fake is I talked to Trump when we did that.
[01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:15.760]  That's not what happened.
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:17.079]  You see?
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:18.460]  This is real.
[01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:23.680]  And, of course, I blew Tucker away to his face doing things like that.
[01:58:24.630 --> 01:58:25.170]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:25.949 --> 01:58:29.170]  So the crew or an archivist of the public can find it.
[01:58:29.289 --> 01:58:32.609]  I'm just asking for this now because it would be important to show people this.
[01:58:33.710 --> 01:58:39.350]  It was about, as I talked about it right after it happened, it was about five, six months ago.
[01:58:40.210 --> 01:58:55.310]  And four times in one week, I was awakened in the middle of the night by the Holy Spirit and And sat up,
[01:58:55.829 --> 01:59:02.750]  turned the light on, feet on the floor, sitting in the bed, in my underwear.
[01:59:04.210 --> 01:59:07.689]  And I'm like, I mean, I don't just wake up for no reason.
[01:59:07.689 --> 01:59:08.390]  I feel it.
[01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:09.829]  I'm like, okay.
[01:59:11.010 --> 01:59:14.210]  And it's, go to the bathroom.
[01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:28.220]  It's going to be 4 a.m., And there's, again, a little portable alarm clock a lot that I keep in the dresser.
[01:59:28.279 --> 01:59:29.279]  I don't usually need an alarm clock.
[01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:30.279]  I wake up at like 5.30 always.
[01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:33.960]  But it's there sometimes if I stay up really late working and I turn it on.
[01:59:34.039 --> 01:59:35.020]  But there's no clock in there.
[01:59:35.039 --> 01:59:36.739]  I don't like ticking and noises and lights.
[01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:41.119]  And I get up.
[01:59:43.739 --> 01:59:46.260]  And I walk into the bathroom to my sink.
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:48.159]  And I like to turn the phone off.
[01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:55.180]  When I'm in the house around the family, because it is a surveillance device, and it's my privacy.
[01:59:57.239 --> 02:00:07.539]  And so I get up every second, walk, and it's like, hurry up, turn it on.
[02:00:09.689 --> 02:00:10.970]  And so I turn the phone on.
[02:00:11.050 --> 02:00:13.289]  This was the fourth time that week.
[02:00:13.689 --> 02:00:14.989]  But this was down to the second.
[02:00:15.369 --> 02:00:16.649]  And I'm sitting there peeing.
[02:00:17.170 --> 02:00:17.989]  Get up the counter.
[02:00:19.949 --> 02:00:21.289]  I'm kind of taking it for granted at this point.
[02:00:21.369 --> 02:00:22.449]  I know God's going to be right.
[02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:23.670]  I'm like, this is crazy.
[02:00:23.869 --> 02:00:25.770]  Of course, I try to be able to observe this.
[02:00:25.869 --> 02:00:26.250]  I'm not going to believe it.
[02:00:26.510 --> 02:00:27.250]  Phone boots up.
[02:00:28.270 --> 02:00:31.810]  And it's 4-0-0.
[02:00:32.819 --> 02:00:38.279]  And then God goes, and you're thinking that this is crazy.
[02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:42.979]  Even though I've shown you four times this week, this is the fourth time, and it's 4 a.m.
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:47.159]  And God goes, it's now 14 seconds to count down 14.
[02:00:47.279 --> 02:00:47.800]  It was instant.
[02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:49.800]  Count properly.
[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:52.260]  It was just in one message.
[02:00:52.439 --> 02:00:53.699]  14 seconds, count properly.
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:57.899]  14, 13, and I'm singing out loud.
[02:00:58.199 --> 02:01:11.159]  12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 401.
[02:01:11.739 --> 02:01:12.779]  And I was done pissing.
[02:01:12.979 --> 02:01:15.340]  That's an exact true story.
[02:01:16.199 --> 02:01:16.920]  So...
[02:01:19.329 --> 02:01:22.550]  Holding my, you know what, with my left hand, holding the phone in my right hand.
[02:01:23.289 --> 02:01:25.090]  God talking to me, just what's going on.
[02:01:25.229 --> 02:01:27.310]  And I'm just like, I know, thank you.
[02:01:27.409 --> 02:01:28.250]  What do I do?
[02:01:28.850 --> 02:01:30.449]  Because the message is, you're not listening.
[02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:34.970]  So I go, get some coffee, sit down, everybody's asleep.
[02:01:34.989 --> 02:01:36.090]  It's like 4.10 in the morning.
[02:01:37.010 --> 02:01:41.770]  I'm sitting at the kitchen breakfast table in my underwear.
[02:01:44.130 --> 02:01:44.489]  And...
[02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:48.880]  I go, what is it I'm not doing right?
[02:01:49.539 --> 02:01:51.500]  Well, they're going to try to shoot Trump.
[02:01:51.579 --> 02:01:52.720]  You got to get on the air and say that.
[02:01:52.819 --> 02:01:54.100]  They're going to try to declare martial law.
[02:01:54.659 --> 02:01:57.000]  They're going to try to use a service-to-air missile.
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:01:59.359]  He's got to get off the golf course.
[02:01:59.979 --> 02:02:02.119]  And then you can find that show.
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:03.960]  I just remember this today.
[02:02:04.119 --> 02:02:06.659]  I remember the story, but I remember the tales now.
[02:02:06.819 --> 02:02:07.720]  And then this is on air.
[02:02:08.399 --> 02:02:11.239]  And then I go on the air that day.
[02:02:13.740 --> 02:02:26.100]  Tell the story, and then say, God's worried they're going to blow up his, or tell him they're going to blow up his plane, bomb inside, disguised as a battery, in a computer or phone, service to air missile, kill him on the golf course.
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:28.359]  He needs to stop having big rallies.
[02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:34.000]  And you can say, well, God protects him at the rally.
[02:02:34.159 --> 02:02:36.819]  Well, I mean, God works through us in free will.
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:39.840]  God could do it himself, obviously, but God wants us to do it.
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:43.000]  So that's God kind of putting his finger on the scale.
[02:02:43.279 --> 02:02:50.300]  And so then I'm just like, I told that story back then, and it's happened some since then, infrequently, because I'm listening.
[02:02:50.779 --> 02:02:52.060]  That's just God showing me.
[02:02:53.539 --> 02:03:02.079]  And then last night I'm sitting here, and God goes, all right, tell him the time he's going to walk on the stage.
[02:03:04.399 --> 02:03:05.340]  And I just go, okay.
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:05.939]  Okay.
[02:03:07.399 --> 02:03:08.880]  And everybody's talking to me.
[02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:10.960]  Literally, you see me on air, I go...
[02:03:12.980 --> 02:03:14.119]  Okay, yes sir, 127.
[02:03:14.539 --> 02:03:14.939]  Okay.
[02:03:15.659 --> 02:03:18.000]  And I should have said, time zone?
[02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:18.699]  Literally.
[02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:21.100]  And it's just, it's there.
[02:03:22.579 --> 02:03:23.460]  It's wild.
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:25.399]  I mean, that's how real this is, folks.
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:27.399]  And you have these abilities as well.
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:29.119]  And the globalists know that.
[02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:31.779]  But you have to open up to it.
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:37.159]  And then you can't deny that I told that story, said what they were doing to Trump, they tried it.
[02:03:38.430 --> 02:03:47.970]  After I tell the story that God's telling me this, and then it happens, and then now I do it live on TV for you, so it's not just me claiming I went and did this, I'm telling you.
[02:03:49.149 --> 02:04:04.489]  And I tell that fourth time that week, because it didn't just click that it was the fourth time, and it was four o'clock, it's just God showing you over and over and over and over again, listen to me.
[02:04:09.770 --> 02:04:15.250]  So we got all this incredible news and all this incredible information, but I'm sitting there with Tucker Carlson at his dinner table.
[02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:18.250]  And it's a private story.
[02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:19.789]  If Tucker ever wants to tell it, he can.
[02:04:22.729 --> 02:04:29.590]  And God tells me.
[02:04:30.890 --> 02:04:33.229]  Yeah, Tucker, so did this happen to you?
[02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:39.319]  Did anybody try to lay hands on you or something, not Christian, ask you to go in a room with them?
[02:04:40.319 --> 02:04:42.439]  Oh, let me guess, it was like a throw in the middle of it?
[02:04:44.319 --> 02:04:47.680]  And when they laid their hands on you, did it send a serious sexual energy through you?
[02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:52.720]  And he goes, he totally freaked out, he goes, yeah, that's exactly, how the hell do you know this?
[02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:54.380]  And I said, no, it's not me.
[02:04:55.220 --> 02:04:56.100]  God wants you to know that.
[02:04:58.710 --> 02:05:00.710]  That's why he says I'm the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[02:05:01.069 --> 02:05:04.430]  I mean, God told me, show Tucker Carlson how real God is through me.
[02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:06.609]  Because he needs to know that.
[02:05:06.710 --> 02:05:09.350]  He already knew, but now you see where he's at.
[02:05:09.590 --> 02:05:11.310]  All the way, fully committed, on fire.
[02:05:12.369 --> 02:05:17.029]  So, the Lord works in mysterious ways, but this goes on.
[02:05:18.529 --> 02:05:28.310]  And I told you, over a year ago, I know prominent people, not just him, that didn't believe in God but were doing good work, but they weren't protected by Jesus because they had to ask God to protect them and the Holy Spirit of their heart.
[02:05:31.970 --> 02:05:42.369]  And they'll be sitting there in their bedroom, wake up, and a black shape comes and attacks them and just scratches their back, their arms, their face.
[02:05:46.930 --> 02:05:50.010]  Sometimes there's a bleh, that noise.
[02:05:52.270 --> 02:05:53.750]  And it's happening more and more.
[02:05:55.130 --> 02:05:57.810]  And let me tell you, they get Jesus real fast.
[02:05:57.930 --> 02:05:59.930]  And you say in the name of Jesus, be gone?
[02:06:02.159 --> 02:06:03.319]  Can't even attack you.
[02:06:07.319 --> 02:06:08.600]  And it's real.
[02:06:09.199 --> 02:06:12.100]  You call it a space alien, whatever it is, okay?
[02:06:12.159 --> 02:06:12.920]  It's real.
[02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:14.000]  All right?
[02:06:15.060 --> 02:06:24.920]  So, and just like the Bible says every culture also says, there's the big guy that made it all, and then he's got entities that work for him.
[02:06:25.020 --> 02:06:25.600]  Those are the angels.
[02:06:25.739 --> 02:06:27.020]  Those are the good guys.
[02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:29.739]  And then there's the bad guys, like everything else in the universe.
[02:06:31.279 --> 02:06:32.920]  I really want to be with the good guys.
[02:06:36.460 --> 02:06:42.239]  God gave us all this consciousness, all this beauty, all this success, all this incredible adventure and free will.
[02:06:43.739 --> 02:06:46.399]  And the devil just wants to destroy it all.
[02:06:46.619 --> 02:06:49.579]  So why would you want to serve the thing that hates you?
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:56.279]  I mean, I know there's a thrill.
[02:07:00.119 --> 02:07:00.560]  I've...
[02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:04.779]  Unintentionally dabbled in evil.
[02:07:06.039 --> 02:07:11.460]  I have been in the deep end without knowing it.
[02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:25.260]  Got tempted by well, the way the real bad guy does it.
[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:33.260]  I've talked to the experts and That's a story for another day.
[02:07:34.359 --> 02:07:37.180]  But I've met the devil at the crossroads and didn't make the deal.
[02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:42.979]  But it didn't mean that some of the devil didn't rub off on me.
[02:07:43.979 --> 02:07:45.899]  But that was God as well.
[02:07:47.220 --> 02:07:53.979]  Because you look at a lot of people that God rises up against the devil have unintentionally been running with the devil.
[02:08:01.789 --> 02:08:02.789]  I've been running with the devil.
[02:08:04.930 --> 02:08:09.270]  And I can tell you the devil's real in the pale moonlight.
[02:08:11.189 --> 02:08:13.609]  And I can tell you right now, you better choose God.
[02:08:13.609 --> 02:08:14.590]  You don't want to be with the devil.
[02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:17.789]  So...
[02:08:17.789 --> 02:08:23.569]  That's why the globalists hate me so much, is...
[02:08:24.869 --> 02:08:36.850]  They look at me and they go, he looks good and he puts off the energy of the guy we hate, but he also kind of looks like the boss.
[02:08:38.569 --> 02:08:39.670]  What is that?
[02:08:40.489 --> 02:08:42.489]  And I've talked about this phenomenon.
[02:08:43.329 --> 02:08:51.050]  Trump flickers with Holy Ghost energy and then you'll see a little devil there.
[02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:53.529]  But see, our spirits are reflective.
[02:08:56.199 --> 02:08:56.920]  Light.
[02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:58.899]  But like a glowing mirror.
[02:08:59.399 --> 02:09:00.800]  But multi-dimensioned.
[02:09:01.659 --> 02:09:04.779]  And so all of us stare into the abyss.
[02:09:04.899 --> 02:09:06.340]  We become partly abyss.
[02:09:07.039 --> 02:09:25.020]  And so the resonance of these Satanists is so low and they're so weak that when they see someone who's a powerful spiritual entity they are Very lustful for it.
[02:09:25.899 --> 02:09:29.420]  And they don't have the power that Trump has.
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:31.819]  They don't have the power that I have.
[02:09:31.979 --> 02:09:35.279]  And they don't like the power you have.
[02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:36.880]  A husband and wife.
[02:09:37.100 --> 02:09:38.079]  The power of your children.
[02:09:38.359 --> 02:09:40.680]  The power of what we can do together.
[02:09:41.739 --> 02:09:43.859]  And God is where the power comes from.
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:52.819]  The devil is just a facsimile twisted of it with pride and the exhilaration of domination.
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:09:59.779]  And it's not even in the same universe as God's power.
[02:10:00.119 --> 02:10:15.659]  God's power is total completion, absolute purity, and I'm just sad for people who have been turned totally over to Satan because they think the power that they access,
[02:10:16.119 --> 02:10:19.920]  which I have accessed, is the power.
[02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:28.779]  And I can tell that the Satanists, I've accessed satanic powers you couldn't even imagine by the time I was like 13 years old.
[02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:30.479]  You don't know anything about it.
[02:10:30.779 --> 02:10:32.140]  You're fools, you're slaves.
[02:10:32.500 --> 02:10:36.960]  And I'm telling you, I've seen what the devil has to offer and it's nothing.
[02:10:37.859 --> 02:10:38.340]  You understand?
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:39.739]  They know it's true.
[02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:45.140]  So, here is the little prediction last night.
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:57.079]  I am projecting, which is about a 95% prediction, I am predicting that at 1.27, Trump comes out on the stage.
[02:10:57.260 --> 02:10:58.260]  1.27.
[02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:01.560]  And then, like, Job had it all given.
[02:11:02.359 --> 02:11:03.619]  Another headset just went out.
[02:11:23.890 --> 02:11:25.630]  Go to President Trump live right now.
[02:11:25.789 --> 02:11:27.770]  I love how my headset went out right when he went up.
[02:11:27.869 --> 02:11:28.229]  Here it is.
[02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:39.739]  And they have the atomic clock in there when he said, thank you, there was two seconds left in the atomic clock, 1.27.
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.439]  In the time zone he was in.
[02:11:46.199 --> 02:11:48.880]  That's the power of God.
[02:11:49.939 --> 02:11:54.659]  And the ethereal is just the energy forces of the universe and all the dimensions bleeding together.
[02:11:55.439 --> 02:11:57.319]  It's just the power cables.
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:06.060]  And so people that don't get in alignment with God, they think the wiring is the power.
[02:12:06.060 --> 02:12:08.220]  They think the world is the power.
[02:12:08.380 --> 02:12:09.939]  They think the devil is the power.
[02:12:10.199 --> 02:12:17.520]  And that's just a one potential conduit through which the energy comes through.
[02:12:18.699 --> 02:12:26.000]  But when you get your power from the devil, it is a twisted, distorted, toxic conduit.
[02:12:31.750 --> 02:12:36.729]  Interdimensional reversal of God's power.
[02:12:38.250 --> 02:12:39.529]  And it cannot build.
[02:12:40.029 --> 02:12:41.149]  It can only destroy.
[02:12:41.630 --> 02:12:43.810]  It is not regenerative.
[02:12:45.449 --> 02:12:48.069]  So there are some of the big secrets of the universe.
[02:12:49.409 --> 02:12:53.590]  And if God keeps telling me to do it, I mean, I guess if I get the order, I'll do it again.
[02:12:53.729 --> 02:12:55.189]  I mean, just tell me.
[02:12:56.079 --> 02:12:57.319]  God, I mean, you want me to do...
[02:12:57.319 --> 02:12:59.560]  God wants me to do it 50 times a day for you.
[02:12:59.619 --> 02:12:59.960]  I'll do it.
[02:13:01.159 --> 02:13:04.640]  I mean, God's like, how much has God got to show you?
[02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:10.460]  But God wanted me to work on Tucker Carlson.
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:15.159]  I mean, I'm just sitting up here one day and I go, he will be fired within one month, 29 days later fired.
[02:13:15.859 --> 02:13:17.020]  Tucker Carlson goes, did they tell you?
[02:13:17.079 --> 02:13:17.420]  How'd you know?
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:18.460]  And I just said, I just...
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:19.479]  God told me to say it.
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:19.979]  I just...
[02:13:21.079 --> 02:13:25.380]  The night of the shooting in Vegas.
[02:13:25.739 --> 02:13:27.359]  It was the Sunday show.
[02:13:27.739 --> 02:13:29.039]  The last 10 seconds.
[02:13:31.079 --> 02:13:32.359]  We can find that.
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:36.119]  And I just said, randomly, I don't remember saying it.
[02:13:36.479 --> 02:13:41.760]  And they'll probably shoot up a major music concert at 10 o'clock at night tonight.
[02:13:42.159 --> 02:13:55.979]  And then the next day, the FBI hostage rescue team Through an individual I know here locally.
[02:13:57.260 --> 02:13:59.140]  Comes to my house.
[02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:03.479]  About 7.30, I'm drinking coffee, about to leave.
[02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:08.119]  Comes in, he goes, yeah, this is such and such on the phone here.
[02:14:08.159 --> 02:14:08.779]  I know this other guy.
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:11.000]  He goes, my buddy from the Army, he's on the hostage rescue team.
[02:14:11.579 --> 02:14:14.300]  Look, they don't think you're involved, but can you just tell?
[02:14:14.979 --> 02:14:15.659]  I said, sure.
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:16.600]  I said, I'll tell you.
[02:14:17.199 --> 02:14:18.460]  Do you remember what you did last night?
[02:14:19.569 --> 02:14:21.649]  And I said, no, on your show.
[02:14:22.930 --> 02:14:24.890]  And I said, no.
[02:14:25.810 --> 02:14:27.270]  Well, you know about what just went on.
[02:14:28.930 --> 02:14:29.609]  And I said, yeah.
[02:14:29.689 --> 02:14:30.770]  And they said, you don't know?
[02:14:30.970 --> 02:14:34.909]  You said there'd be a shooting at a music concert at 10 o'clock at night?
[02:14:36.170 --> 02:14:37.170]  Just at the end of your show?
[02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:38.510]  And I went, I didn't remember that.
[02:14:38.949 --> 02:14:40.130]  And sure as hell, I went back.
[02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:42.840]  And we can go dig it up.
[02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:43.659]  And I just...
[02:14:43.659 --> 02:14:46.619]  What the hell is that?
[02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:47.680]  Excuse me, Lord.
[02:14:48.079 --> 02:14:49.140]  You know what I mean?
[02:14:49.279 --> 02:14:50.460]  It's just...
[02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:51.659]  Oh, my God.
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:54.199]  I mean, look, I just feel like you guys need to know this.
[02:14:54.220 --> 02:14:56.039]  You need to understand how the universe really works.
[02:14:58.199 --> 02:15:02.260]  And the FBI guy goes, yeah, that's what we figured.
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:08.119]  Well, if you ever want to work for us, we'll offer you a lot of money to do that.
[02:15:09.010 --> 02:15:11.970]  And I said, I don't control it.
[02:15:12.149 --> 02:15:12.890]  It's not me.
[02:15:13.449 --> 02:15:15.430]  And he goes, yeah, that's what we, yeah, we figured.
[02:15:15.630 --> 02:15:16.250]  Yeah, we understand.
[02:15:17.170 --> 02:15:19.050]  Because you don't think they don't look into all that stuff.
[02:15:19.090 --> 02:15:20.130]  You don't think they don't see stuff.
[02:15:20.449 --> 02:15:27.770]  You don't think the famous detectives in history just happen to know where everything is and all that stuff.
[02:15:27.869 --> 02:15:31.109]  You think they just, you know, they can just imagine that they know.
[02:15:31.590 --> 02:15:34.750]  Because this is a real thing, people.
[02:15:35.289 --> 02:15:36.770]  So I'm going to move on from this.
[02:15:38.020 --> 02:15:40.840]  And I've got all these clips now, and no one's got the latest on the disputed elections.
[02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:49.500]  It's epic, it's huge, it's historic, it's massive, but now it makes winning the war even more important because I don't want to win this battle and then lose the war.
[02:15:50.779 --> 02:15:52.319]  The stakes are even higher now.
[02:15:52.319 --> 02:15:53.039]  It's incredible.
[02:15:53.039 --> 02:15:54.260]  I don't blame people celebrating.
[02:15:54.399 --> 02:15:54.960]  You deserve it.
[02:15:56.079 --> 02:15:59.859]  I think you should go to the AlexJonesStore.com and get, I think, the best Trump gear out there.
[02:16:00.729 --> 02:16:02.329]  And you support free speech.
[02:16:02.430 --> 02:16:03.789]  You put it in the face of the bad guys.
[02:16:03.789 --> 02:16:05.890]  You exercise your freedom that they're not bullying you.
[02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:08.149]  You normalize loving America again.
[02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:09.550]  It's a very important action.
[02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:11.050]  And it keeps us on the air.
[02:16:11.369 --> 02:16:12.149]  And it's there.
[02:16:12.270 --> 02:16:13.609]  And I need money to keep the fight up.
[02:16:15.989 --> 02:16:21.829]  I just realized I haven't been praying for rich people to come help us.
[02:16:21.909 --> 02:16:23.029]  I don't really ever even do that.
[02:16:24.020 --> 02:16:25.800]  God's like, well, maybe you should ask rich people.
[02:16:25.899 --> 02:16:26.579]  Maybe that's the answer.
[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:29.279]  Usually some strings come with it.
[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:31.239]  That's why I've never gotten big funding or anything.
[02:16:32.639 --> 02:16:36.280]  But if somebody wants to make another Bitcoin donation, we sure need it.
[02:16:36.879 --> 02:16:39.280]  Go to alexjones.live, alexjones.live.
[02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:44.680]  It's got the donation pages and all the shopping carts all listed on one page at alexjones.live.
[02:16:45.799 --> 02:16:46.840]  I'm going to stop there.
[02:16:54.090 --> 02:16:55.829]  Yeah, exercise your free speech.
[02:16:56.450 --> 02:16:57.909]  And together we can do a lot.
[02:16:58.430 --> 02:16:59.530]  Alright, let's start going to the clips.
[02:16:59.770 --> 02:17:00.909]  These are all so important.
[02:17:00.989 --> 02:17:03.049]  I don't even know which one to go to first.
[02:17:04.229 --> 02:17:07.989]  This is that little demon Wallace.
[02:17:09.309 --> 02:17:12.889]  Let's play both Wallace clips here back to back.
[02:17:13.729 --> 02:17:14.770]  Here is Wallace.
[02:17:15.250 --> 02:17:17.129]  This is not just his party.
[02:17:17.510 --> 02:17:19.030]  This is his country.
[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:26.159]  And then he goes on to elaborate on that.
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:30.600]  Let's just, we'll get back to Wallace later, but let's play the first one.
[02:17:30.860 --> 02:17:31.440]  Here's Wallace.
[02:17:32.710 --> 02:17:34.690]  And, you know, this is his party.
[02:17:34.889 --> 02:17:37.270]  This is, these, these voters...
[02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:37.770]  It's not just his party.
[02:17:37.950 --> 02:17:38.309]  What?
[02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:39.770]  It's not just his party now.
[02:17:40.069 --> 02:17:41.190]  No, it's his country.
[02:17:41.350 --> 02:17:43.549]  I mean, again, we have to be careful.
[02:17:43.549 --> 02:17:49.209]  We haven't called it yet, but Pennsylvania makes it extremely tough for Kamala Harris.
[02:17:49.409 --> 02:17:52.149]  And that's one of the things, I mean, that the Trump side...
[02:17:52.149 --> 02:17:54.270]  I mean, these people are all just mercenaries.
[02:17:55.190 --> 02:18:00.430]  That are dumb enough to think working with the establishment when it's imploding is a smart move.
[02:18:00.530 --> 02:18:03.829]  I mean, don't work with them because they're evil, even if they can give you all the money in the world.
[02:18:05.790 --> 02:18:08.909]  Again, if somebody gave you a billion dollars, would you give them your eyeballs?
[02:18:09.170 --> 02:18:09.409]  No.
[02:18:13.430 --> 02:18:14.190]  Your soul?
[02:18:14.870 --> 02:18:16.750]  I mean, it's stupid.
[02:18:17.950 --> 02:18:18.750]  Here is...
[02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:23.770]  Clip three, Jake Tapper and Anderson Cooper.
[02:18:23.969 --> 02:18:25.489]  This is the greatest comeback in history.
[02:18:25.629 --> 02:18:27.290]  And finally, for once, CNN is telling the truth.
[02:18:27.450 --> 02:18:27.649]  Here it is.
[02:18:28.129 --> 02:18:35.129]  And Anderson, it is hard to think of a political comeback that is actually more significant than this one.
[02:18:35.229 --> 02:18:40.750]  I'm tempted to say Richard Nixon, but that really falls short of what Donald Trump has achieved.
[02:18:41.430 --> 02:18:48.790]  Yeah, I mean, winning not just the electoral votes, but the popular vote as well.
[02:18:50.199 --> 02:18:53.319]  Yeah, you guys aren't just on a sinking ship.
[02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:54.760]  You're bad.
[02:18:55.219 --> 02:19:01.139]  Your people control you with pedophilia and other illegal crap and sick stuff.
[02:19:02.079 --> 02:19:08.200]  And all your BS and all your theft didn't work.
[02:19:08.559 --> 02:19:12.780]  And now you know your bosses are going to try to get you to go along with a civil war?
[02:19:13.219 --> 02:19:18.979]  And now you want to start a fight with people that are way more numerous and motivated than you?
[02:19:20.510 --> 02:19:22.190]  And you're trying to start a nuclear war with Russia.
[02:19:23.229 --> 02:19:27.170]  Let's go pick the most dangerous nuclear power and let's just get a fight going with them.
[02:19:27.250 --> 02:19:28.129]  That always works out well.
[02:19:30.170 --> 02:19:30.870]  You're crazy.
[02:19:32.350 --> 02:19:33.610]  You're absolutely crazy.
[02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:56.530]  And I'm telling you, as long as we trust God and keep fighting, God is going to give us the discernment to lead God and direct us And God is going to turn on the gifts and turn up the gifts that he's given all of us that are fighting evil.
[02:19:57.229 --> 02:20:05.889]  I mean, quite frankly, my abilities as the evil intensifies just get stronger exponentially.
[02:20:06.149 --> 02:20:07.809]  And I know you're seeing it within your own lives.
[02:20:08.610 --> 02:20:16.190]  So, they can't win in the end unless they convince us to surrender, which is not going to happen.
[02:20:16.969 --> 02:20:18.969]  We've got some even crazier ones here.
[02:20:22.819 --> 02:20:32.239]  And I've got another clip here where they're saying that the deep state's going to come after Trump and don't worry, they're going to stop him.
[02:20:33.299 --> 02:20:35.020]  I mean, this is just wild.
[02:20:35.860 --> 02:20:37.860]  So we know what they're going to do.
[02:20:40.059 --> 02:20:45.520]  And the key is stop being naive and going, oh, that's not really that bad.
[02:20:45.659 --> 02:20:45.879]  No, no.
[02:20:46.219 --> 02:20:48.799]  They're as bad as you can imagine.
[02:20:48.940 --> 02:20:49.700]  You know, there's Chris Hayes.
[02:20:49.780 --> 02:20:50.280]  Oh, don't worry.
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:51.319]  The deep state will crush him.
[02:20:51.579 --> 02:20:56.139]  Well, CIA will deal with this rabid of scum immediately.
[02:20:57.620 --> 02:21:00.639]  God sees him, sees him.
[02:21:00.819 --> 02:21:05.700]  Well, how dare you stand against our royal power?
[02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:19.909]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I say I'm excited about bringing you the ultimate gut cleanse, exclusively available at thealexjonesstore.com, I'm not joking around.
[02:21:20.129 --> 02:21:23.389]  We don't sit there and shoot in the dark.
[02:21:23.690 --> 02:21:34.129]  We go out and we find what are already the best-selling, highest-rated products in the country, and we say, hey, we'd like to private label it, but we'd like you to make it a little bit stronger for us so it's proprietary.
[02:21:34.709 --> 02:21:35.989]  You got it right here.
[02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:37.780]  The ultimate gut cleanse.
[02:21:37.899 --> 02:21:39.479]  This is not just a gut cleanse.
[02:21:39.799 --> 02:21:40.979]  It's not just a detox.
[02:21:41.239 --> 02:21:44.280]  It doesn't just have natural ingredients that gently get rid of parasites.
[02:21:44.559 --> 02:21:45.600]  Oh, it's got that covered.
[02:21:45.899 --> 02:21:50.000]  It's then got a whole bunch of stuff in it like saw palmetto that's good for all your glands.
[02:21:50.239 --> 02:21:52.959]  And even the government admits great for men's prostates.
[02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:55.180]  And it goes on and on.
[02:21:55.379 --> 02:21:56.860]  I cannot read all the ingredients.
[02:21:56.959 --> 02:21:58.040]  They're concentrated.
[02:21:58.219 --> 02:21:59.100]  They're incredible.
[02:21:59.399 --> 02:22:04.559]  You want to get it right now at thealexjonesstore.com for between 30% and 50% off.
[02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:07.899]  50% off for you to the combo and get it with the Ultimate Probiotic.
[02:22:09.250 --> 02:22:16.290]  All right, Roger Stone and General Flynn are coming up in the fourth hour and a lot more than Owen Schroer is going to have a jam-packed broadcast 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:22:16.370 --> 02:22:16.590]  today.
[02:22:17.129 --> 02:22:24.090]  Despite the fact that I basically haven't slept in three days, I slept two hours last night, about an hour and a half the night before, about an hour the night before.
[02:22:25.469 --> 02:22:33.649]  I'm going to continue on because this is too historic and the audience is too huge right now with too many new listeners who have never heard this information before.
[02:22:34.129 --> 02:22:37.270]  Now, I've been talking big picture and what we need to do.
[02:22:38.579 --> 02:22:39.399]  Protect Trump.
[02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:42.219]  Know they're coming with riots and civil unrest.
[02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:42.940]  That's confirmed.
[02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:44.819]  All sorts of false flags.
[02:22:44.940 --> 02:22:45.440]  Be aware of that.
[02:22:45.540 --> 02:22:46.500]  Be exposing it beforehand.
[02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:47.860]  Get in their face.
[02:22:49.860 --> 02:22:51.379]  Discredit it immediately when they pull it.
[02:22:53.420 --> 02:22:55.659]  Make sure his administration gets full of patriots.
[02:22:56.920 --> 02:23:00.139]  And then we've got to prosecute the globalists because they're going to continue committing their crimes.
[02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:00.799]  We don't.
[02:23:01.260 --> 02:23:05.040]  And case in point, it's not policy of the Justice Department.
[02:23:05.200 --> 02:23:19.340]  It's federal law That criminal prosecutions of the president have to be dropped because the other sectors of government, the other branches, legislative and judicial, would become dictators and remove the executive anytime they wanted.
[02:23:19.639 --> 02:23:25.719]  The check on the president is impeachment or not being re-elected.
[02:23:26.579 --> 02:23:27.799]  So there are checks.
[02:23:27.879 --> 02:23:29.059]  He can't just do whatever he wants.
[02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:32.879]  And there's that.
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.219]  But now the feds have dropped...
[02:23:36.219 --> 02:23:48.280]  I've announced they're dropping the federal cases against Trump, but Letitia James came out, literally ran, funded by George Soros, literally is a fellow of his group, works for him, on putting Trump in prison.
[02:23:48.739 --> 02:23:55.540]  She is vowing to bring more state charges because Trump can pardon himself from the other conviction.
[02:23:56.040 --> 02:24:06.620]  So we'll unpack all of that after Owen gives us a very important breakdown on the ongoing races that are so critical, because in 2018, 2020, 2022.
[02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:12.020]  Remember, the Republicans had four or five each time extra seats in the House.
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:15.479]  And it looked like they were winning.
[02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:22.280]  And then they'd lose seats in the next week or so in these races when no one was watching.
[02:24:22.479 --> 02:24:27.760]  Then the feds would go and indict a bunch of others to get rid of the Republican majority.
[02:24:28.579 --> 02:24:30.780]  They'd threaten and blackmail others to resign.
[02:24:31.459 --> 02:24:33.780]  So we need a bigger majority in the House.
[02:24:34.690 --> 02:24:37.069]  So that is a big deal.
[02:24:37.250 --> 02:24:41.709]  So with numbers on the Senate, numbers on the House, of course, in case you missed it, final numbers on Trump.
[02:24:42.229 --> 02:24:43.549]  Harris has said at 3 p.m.
[02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:47.389]  Central, oh, it'll carry it live when the war room starts, an hour and 25 minutes.
[02:24:48.270 --> 02:24:50.309]  Her concession speech, so good for her.
[02:24:50.430 --> 02:24:51.510]  Hillary never gave one.
[02:24:53.950 --> 02:25:03.469]  But, and she was supposed to give one last night, so she's still cut and run, but I guess they've explained to her that it's just too embarrassing if she puts her tail between her legs.
[02:25:04.049 --> 02:25:07.729]  So they're going to give her, I guess, a teleprompter, and she's going to waddle out there.
[02:25:08.709 --> 02:25:20.090]  But the big issue is, we were watching, we had the poll watchers, we had the lawyers, Trump did a good job, you supported Trump, you did a good job, took a lot of money, hundreds of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions.
[02:25:21.039 --> 02:25:21.840]  Just on an election.
[02:25:22.020 --> 02:25:23.799]  It was over almost 200 million election integrity.
[02:25:24.299 --> 02:25:25.239]  Takes money to win a war.
[02:25:26.340 --> 02:25:28.840]  And they did a pretty good job.
[02:25:29.059 --> 02:25:30.260]  A lot of the fraud got caught.
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:31.379]  It mitigated it.
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:32.180]  And we won.
[02:25:32.260 --> 02:25:33.459]  And the trucks, that's a whole other story.
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:38.840]  We have videos from James O'Keefe and a bunch of others in Georgia, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania.
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:56.399]  While they were holding off announcing them at midnight and everything, huge trucks pulling up full of ballast, and people just went, and people from California license plates walking in with the reinforcements.
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:01.079]  But then the bosses went, no, they got lawyers in here.
[02:26:01.239 --> 02:26:03.959]  We can't kick everybody out like last time and cover up the windows.
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:05.659]  Dog don't hunt.
[02:26:07.620 --> 02:26:08.719]  It's like, we're here.
[02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:12.250]  We got the ballots, and of course, these are just carriers.
[02:26:14.069 --> 02:26:15.250]  It's all compartmentalized.
[02:26:15.329 --> 02:26:16.489]  It's like, hey, just carry these ballots.
[02:26:17.950 --> 02:26:18.670]  Here you go.
[02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:24.149]  So, day late and a dollar short for them, but don't think they're not going to strike back.
[02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:28.350]  We've got Owen here, who did, again, incredible crew.
[02:26:28.629 --> 02:26:30.329]  Everybody, amazing job last night.
[02:26:30.430 --> 02:26:31.729]  Thanks to the listeners for supporting us.
[02:26:31.809 --> 02:26:33.049]  We can have an amazing crew like this.
[02:26:33.969 --> 02:26:35.569]  We could be shut down in five days.
[02:26:35.729 --> 02:26:36.530]  Just don't forget that.
[02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:38.670]  Owen Schroyer, give us the latest.
[02:26:40.110 --> 02:26:48.649]  Well, Alex, we've already seen what looked like two Senate seats that were going to go red last night flip to blue overnight.
[02:26:48.649 --> 02:26:50.430]  We're witnessing this in real time.
[02:26:50.430 --> 02:26:55.989]  In fact, they've already declared Wisconsin for Tammy Baldwin, the incumbent.
[02:26:56.780 --> 02:27:01.520]  Looks like she's gonna finish with about a 30,000-vote victory there.
[02:27:02.180 --> 02:27:10.440]  Last night, as soon as Trump took the lead there, Hobday was ahead all night, and then we wake up this morning, Tammy Baldwin has the lead.
[02:27:11.079 --> 02:27:12.479]  Based off of...
[02:27:12.879 --> 02:27:26.719]  The numbers, these margins are so thin all over Wisconsin, but it looks like most of her votes were picked up in North Wisconsin and South Wisconsin, and it looks like there was a lot of crossover there.
[02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:40.520]  Baldwin, perhaps with the incumbency power, was able to We're good to go.
[02:27:41.020 --> 02:27:51.360]  We're good to go.
[02:28:00.149 --> 02:28:03.969]  Took the lead and then ultimately was able to win the state.
[02:28:04.250 --> 02:28:07.290]  But again, these numbers are so thin.
[02:28:07.610 --> 02:28:16.850]  I mean, we're talking about maybe a couple hundred people, maybe a thousand in some of these other districts that voted for Trump and then voted for Slotkin.
[02:28:17.270 --> 02:28:20.190]  Try to work your mind around why that might have been.
[02:28:20.370 --> 02:28:21.610]  Maybe these were women voters.
[02:28:21.610 --> 02:28:22.430]  I don't know.
[02:28:23.049 --> 02:28:35.760]  But it wasn't really a situation where it was Detroit We're good to go.
[02:28:57.229 --> 02:29:05.809]  McCormick is still ahead by more than 30,000 votes with 97% in, but they're saying too close to call.
[02:29:06.370 --> 02:29:08.829]  This is one we might want to watch.
[02:29:08.969 --> 02:29:14.149]  As we know, they said they still had 50,000 ballots that they arrived last night.
[02:29:14.750 --> 02:29:17.489]  And there's going to be another 40,000 that arrives today.
[02:29:18.010 --> 02:29:26.530]  And so if this thing flips and Casey defeats McCormick, probably those bonus ballots, Alex.
[02:29:26.829 --> 02:29:34.049]  But the good news is, as you said, and we've heard from multiple Republicans today, they do have lawyers on the scene.
[02:29:34.110 --> 02:29:36.370]  They are monitoring the scene here.
[02:29:36.510 --> 02:29:44.030]  I hope that they continue to monitor and Project Veritas continues to videotape because we need to watch out for this.
[02:29:44.299 --> 02:29:50.840]  Because this is, even though the Republicans do already have the majority in the Senate, it'd be nice to have 53 instead of 52.
[02:29:51.100 --> 02:29:54.620]  So if we zoom back out here, we'll take a look at the map.
[02:29:55.100 --> 02:29:59.600]  Flipped West Virginia, flipped Ohio, should flip Pennsylvania.
[02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:04.639]  We'll see if they play any shenanigans in the final moments here at the buzzer for the Democrats.
[02:30:05.430 --> 02:30:10.370]  Had Wisconsin and Michigan flipped last night, now it flipped to Democrats this morning.
[02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:12.889]  Montana was your highest odds for a flip.
[02:30:13.329 --> 02:30:16.110]  Sheehy wins with a pretty good majority there.
[02:30:16.670 --> 02:30:19.389]  Now, again, Nevada is tight.
[02:30:19.629 --> 02:30:21.850]  I mean, this deal is neck and neck.
[02:30:21.850 --> 02:30:25.909]  We're talking about 1,000 votes right now, Brown versus Rosen.
[02:30:26.090 --> 02:30:30.610]  This would be a huge, huge victory for Republicans to flip that seat.
[02:30:30.829 --> 02:30:33.250]  But the problem is the Supreme Court there ruled last Monday...
[02:30:34.049 --> 02:30:35.329]  That what did they rule?
[02:30:35.450 --> 02:30:39.930]  That they can count unpostmarked ballots for three days after, meaning they can make up whatever they need.
[02:30:41.489 --> 02:30:49.469]  Well, certainly the case, and so we'll monitor what happens in Nevada, but that would be huge to flip that seat and beat that incumbent.
[02:30:49.750 --> 02:30:51.129]  You know, that's another interesting thing here.
[02:30:51.190 --> 02:30:55.950]  The incumbency power saved the Democrats in Wisconsin and Michigan, but maybe not in Nevada.
[02:30:55.950 --> 02:30:57.649]  But we're continuing to watch this, Alex.
[02:30:57.750 --> 02:30:58.469]  This one is tight.
[02:30:58.670 --> 02:31:03.450]  The truth is the Democrats just didn't get the numbers in Nevada.
[02:31:03.709 --> 02:31:06.010]  Trump did very well in Nevada, even the blue areas.
[02:31:06.110 --> 02:31:11.600]  When you look at these blue areas, the splits here for Democrats, Not that good.
[02:31:11.799 --> 02:31:12.600]  Not that good.
[02:31:12.719 --> 02:31:15.819]  Not even getting a majority of the vote in Clark County.
[02:31:15.819 --> 02:31:17.739]  I think they might have had it in Washaw.
[02:31:17.959 --> 02:31:19.379]  No, couldn't even get it in Washaw either.
[02:31:20.959 --> 02:31:23.139]  But this thing's coming right down to the line.
[02:31:23.219 --> 02:31:24.700]  These splits were tight across the state.
[02:31:24.819 --> 02:31:26.579]  Now, the last one to look at here is Arizona.
[02:31:26.739 --> 02:31:31.379]  Now, Carrie Lake has been down in Arizona since the beginning.
[02:31:31.760 --> 02:31:33.059]  Her numbers have not been good.
[02:31:33.239 --> 02:31:37.299]  In fact, guys, let's zoom out to the big board first, just to look at the broader numbers here.
[02:31:38.299 --> 02:31:45.059]  So Gallego, now, Lake has kind of closed the gap, but yet still behind by more than 50,000 votes.
[02:31:45.200 --> 02:31:46.420]  Gallego has been leading all day.
[02:31:46.559 --> 02:31:48.299]  You do only have 63% in.
[02:31:48.540 --> 02:31:51.520]  Now, Carrie Lake is insisting she's still in this race.
[02:31:51.819 --> 02:31:53.500]  She's made multiple public statements.
[02:31:53.760 --> 02:31:55.620]  She's claiming she's still in this race.
[02:31:55.780 --> 02:31:57.559]  So we'll continue to watch that.
[02:31:58.909 --> 02:32:01.329]  But again, there's no real surprises here.
[02:32:01.450 --> 02:32:09.190]  The Democrats did really well in Maricopa County and in the areas that they normally win, Pima County as well.
[02:32:10.250 --> 02:32:18.290]  But again, what's strange when we look at these numbers, and Arizona is still probably the least number of votes have been counted in Arizona.
[02:32:18.290 --> 02:32:20.809]  I don't know why they can't figure out how to count votes in Arizona.
[02:32:20.809 --> 02:32:22.450]  Seems to be a problem they have in that state.
[02:32:22.889 --> 02:32:25.629]  But Trump does well.
[02:32:25.889 --> 02:32:27.469]  They're still counting even the presidential votes.
[02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:29.040]  I just don't understand.
[02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:33.979]  It's a bit of an anomaly why Trump could win Arizona or at least perform better than Lake.
[02:32:34.340 --> 02:32:38.739]  You'd think that would be a race that Trump could carry Lake across the finish line in.
[02:32:39.219 --> 02:32:42.360]  But as of right now, the numbers do not favor carry Lake.
[02:32:42.520 --> 02:32:45.159]  Well, the Democrat Party sees another potential Trump in her.
[02:32:45.239 --> 02:32:51.020]  She's really smart and very well-spoken and a good-looking woman on top of it.
[02:32:51.139 --> 02:32:53.719]  And so they're scared of smart, powerful women.
[02:32:53.860 --> 02:32:55.120]  I mean, let's get that straight.
[02:32:55.949 --> 02:33:05.190]  Well, should Carrie Lake end up forfeiting this race and not contesting it, I think that she becomes the number one candidate to be Trump's press secretary.
[02:33:05.409 --> 02:33:06.989]  Quite frankly, they have a pretty good relationship.
[02:33:07.149 --> 02:33:08.649]  So let's zoom back out here.
[02:33:08.729 --> 02:33:10.129]  Let's take a look at the big board again.
[02:33:10.889 --> 02:33:14.209]  Republicans plus two in the Senate right now.
[02:33:14.879 --> 02:33:20.059]  I think it's fair to say, I mean, Nevada or Pennsylvania, let's just split the difference, Alex.
[02:33:20.319 --> 02:33:27.000]  If they get one of those, it's a 53 seats for the Republicans in the Senate.
[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:33.459]  It looks like they are going to successfully overcome the deficit they had in Michigan and Arizona.
[02:33:33.459 --> 02:33:38.159]  I just haven't seen anything good that indicates that Carrie Lake will end up on top of that race.
[02:33:39.290 --> 02:33:40.690]  She's saying they're still counting.
[02:33:40.790 --> 02:33:42.069]  She still seems to have faith.
[02:33:42.250 --> 02:33:46.809]  But it looks like I'd say 53 will probably be the number at the end of the day.
[02:33:46.809 --> 02:33:49.969]  If we're lucky for the Republicans, it will be 54.
[02:33:50.309 --> 02:33:53.229]  So that's what's going on in the Senate for now, Alex.
[02:33:54.229 --> 02:33:55.170]  What about the House?
[02:33:56.610 --> 02:33:58.510]  All right, guys, let's pull up the House map.
[02:33:59.010 --> 02:34:03.430]  So I believe right now, if you would scroll up for me real quick, guys, we can get a number total.
[02:34:04.530 --> 02:34:09.829]  I believe right now, I mean the total number of confirmed Republicans we have in the House.
[02:34:09.950 --> 02:34:10.469]  It should be up.
[02:34:10.569 --> 02:34:10.930]  There we go.
[02:34:11.209 --> 02:34:12.469]  So we're at 207.
[02:34:12.590 --> 02:34:14.250]  You need 218 for the majority.
[02:34:14.409 --> 02:34:15.190]  All right, 207.
[02:34:15.329 --> 02:34:17.030]  So guys, let's scroll back down to the map here.
[02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:19.149]  Let's just try to go one by one if we're running out of time.
[02:34:19.229 --> 02:34:22.110]  If you go to Maine, I believe the Democrats have this one pretty much locked up.
[02:34:22.479 --> 02:34:23.239]  Yeah, okay.
[02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:24.440]  That main district, too.
[02:34:24.540 --> 02:34:26.959]  That's probably going to be a Democrat, so you're not getting anything there.
[02:34:27.340 --> 02:34:28.959]  Let's try to move fast here, guys.
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:31.680]  New York, not looking good there.
[02:34:31.799 --> 02:34:34.020]  It's a tight race, but probably going to go for the Democrats.
[02:34:35.219 --> 02:34:36.219]  Yeah, just keep going.
[02:34:36.420 --> 02:34:38.299]  Now, Maryland, this race is crazy in Maryland.
[02:34:38.639 --> 02:34:39.739]  Look at this split.
[02:34:40.149 --> 02:34:42.870]  We are talking about a couple hundred votes.
[02:34:43.010 --> 02:34:43.989]  You almost can't even believe it.
[02:34:44.709 --> 02:34:47.430]  So you could say this thing is still up in the air.
[02:34:47.549 --> 02:34:49.389]  Just a couple hundred votes separate the two.
[02:34:49.569 --> 02:34:51.850]  85% in in Maryland District 6.
[02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:54.989]  That's probably a toss-up, but I don't think we can count anything.
[02:34:55.430 --> 02:34:57.329]  Guys, I think there might be one more here that we missed.
[02:34:59.850 --> 02:35:02.569]  Yeah, okay, so Virginia District 7 not looking good.
[02:35:02.569 --> 02:35:03.770]  Let's continue to go down.
[02:35:04.149 --> 02:35:07.129]  Actually, this Pennsylvania District, I think the Republican had a lead here.
[02:35:08.739 --> 02:35:11.860]  Yeah, so it looks like, okay, so there's your 208.
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:14.319]  Again, unless shenanigans.
[02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:17.719]  I mean, you've got 99% in, Alex, so I don't know why.
[02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:19.799]  I don't know what we're waiting for.
[02:35:19.899 --> 02:35:20.940]  Let's pay attention to that.
[02:35:21.079 --> 02:35:23.920]  You're talking about 6,000 votes, 99% in.
[02:35:24.159 --> 02:35:27.340]  This should be done, so let's pay attention to that.
[02:35:27.459 --> 02:35:28.479]  That should be 208.
[02:35:28.579 --> 02:35:30.219]  Let's look at North Carolina here, guys.
[02:35:31.769 --> 02:35:35.549]  That's an unfortunate result right there for the Republicans.
[02:35:35.770 --> 02:35:38.250]  All right, let's continue to go down the list here.
[02:35:38.389 --> 02:35:39.969]  Florida locked up, all these other states.
[02:35:40.129 --> 02:35:41.690]  Hold on, we got one here in Ohio.
[02:35:43.309 --> 02:35:45.629]  That's an unfortunate result, but that one is tight.
[02:35:45.969 --> 02:35:54.270]  I mean, again, you're talking just a couple thousand votes there, but that one with 94% in probably not going to flip.
[02:35:54.430 --> 02:35:59.889]  So you're looking for where can Republicans pick up these seats Iowa, okay.
[02:36:00.149 --> 02:36:02.969]  Now maybe you're thinking you're at 209.
[02:36:03.209 --> 02:36:04.569]  Even this one is tight.
[02:36:05.069 --> 02:36:06.250]  99% in, though.
[02:36:06.389 --> 02:36:08.309]  I think you're probably looking at 209 at this point.
[02:36:08.430 --> 02:36:10.010]  Let's continue to roll down here, guys.
[02:36:12.170 --> 02:36:14.309]  Louisiana, that's going to go for the Democrats.
[02:36:16.090 --> 02:36:19.030]  Let's kind of try to move as fast as we can here now, guys.
[02:36:19.350 --> 02:36:21.930]  Let's look at Nebraska right here.
[02:36:23.659 --> 02:36:24.520]  That's looking good.
[02:36:24.639 --> 02:36:27.920]  Okay, so now you're looking at 210 if you're the Republicans.
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:32.420]  It looks like Flores is going to lose her race down there in Texas.
[02:36:33.379 --> 02:36:34.340]  That's unfortunate.
[02:36:34.940 --> 02:36:37.399]  Okay, so let's just keep going down the line here.
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:41.219]  Okay, you're not getting Colorado District 8.
[02:36:44.399 --> 02:36:51.100]  Okay, now you're looking at maybe 210 on your map here in Colorado District 3.
[02:36:52.219 --> 02:36:54.979]  That's an unfortunate result in Arizona.
[02:36:55.020 --> 02:36:57.780]  So, I mean, you're scrapping right now if you're the Republicans.
[02:36:58.479 --> 02:37:00.399]  Okay, now you're looking at 211.
[02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:02.079]  That looks like it's going to be a good result.
[02:37:02.819 --> 02:37:06.079]  Now let's look at California here, guys.
[02:37:06.239 --> 02:37:07.340]  Or did we go to Nevada yet?
[02:37:08.219 --> 02:37:09.079]  Yeah, we did.
[02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:10.360]  Okay, so now let's go to California.
[02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:11.100]  Okay.
[02:37:13.119 --> 02:37:13.479]  Two.
[02:37:13.479 --> 02:37:14.920]  I think that that's probably safe.
[02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:15.680]  You're at 212.
[02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:17.899]  Let's continue to go down here.
[02:37:19.799 --> 02:37:21.040]  Not going to get that.
[02:37:23.579 --> 02:37:25.180]  It looks like 213.
[02:37:25.680 --> 02:37:26.319]  Guys, go down.
[02:37:26.379 --> 02:37:28.219]  I think there's another district or two over here, too.
[02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:30.680]  Down here.
[02:37:32.479 --> 02:37:34.799]  Okay, let's just make sure, because these things are so choppy.
[02:37:36.700 --> 02:37:39.100]  I think we're at 213 now, though, Alex.
[02:37:39.260 --> 02:37:40.959]  All right, let's continue to go up this coast here.
[02:37:44.219 --> 02:37:45.739]  That one looks like a done deal.
[02:37:45.959 --> 02:37:50.280]  And then up here, that one, unfortunately, we can't get Joe Kent in.
[02:37:50.399 --> 02:37:51.540]  So, I mean, I don't know, Alex.
[02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:52.840]  This thing is looking...
[02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:56.420]  We should pick up Begich in Arkansas.
[02:37:57.989 --> 02:38:00.010]  Yeah, or excuse me, in Alaska.
[02:38:00.250 --> 02:38:00.610]  Pardon me.
[02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:02.250]  So this thing is tight.
[02:38:02.430 --> 02:38:04.329]  I mean, we're right on the razor's edge.
[02:38:04.430 --> 02:38:13.370]  The Republicans are going to be scrapping just to, it looks like at this point, just to even draw even strength in the House.
[02:38:13.569 --> 02:38:22.750]  So we're going to continue to monitor these races as the numbers come in and some of these tight races that are literally split just by a couple hundred or a couple thousand votes.
[02:38:23.540 --> 02:38:32.979]  But it's really a strange thing to see that the Republicans might win the Senate and the White House and then lose in the House.
[02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:35.299]  Very strange thing to witness this.
[02:38:36.319 --> 02:38:42.559]  And the numbers are still coming in, Alex, but that might be the situation we're looking at in 24 hours.
[02:38:45.140 --> 02:38:56.700]  So, and I'm looking at the mainstream media, they're not really even saying the Republicans could lose the House, and I'm not saying you're being a pessimist, but the margin was still razor thin.
[02:38:58.579 --> 02:39:07.600]  The mainstream media is reporting that they might gain a few seats, but like you said last night, they've done this before, that makes us go to sleep, and then they can provide the ballots in the key areas.
[02:39:07.870 --> 02:39:12.950]  Then they'd be able to have all their fake investigations and derail a lot of Trump's economic agenda.
[02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:17.090]  Are you saying it's looking like we might not get the House?
[02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:20.379]  I'm saying the fight is still on.
[02:39:20.500 --> 02:39:25.760]  And when you look at some of these seats that flipped, they weren't expecting a seat in Texas.
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:27.840]  They weren't expecting a seat in Alabama.
[02:39:28.239 --> 02:39:29.780]  I don't think either.
[02:39:30.020 --> 02:39:34.920]  You know, even in New York, where Trump overperformed.
[02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:40.540]  So, I mean, I think that there were some shockers here that ended up flipping.
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:42.360]  And...
[02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:44.559]  I'm just saying this deal is tight.
[02:39:44.799 --> 02:39:46.319]  That's all I'm saying, Alex.
[02:39:46.579 --> 02:39:52.280]  Again, it's so much harder to deal with these House races because there's so many different ones.
[02:39:52.760 --> 02:40:01.299]  And it doesn't really act like the Senate, where usually the presidential candidate can carry the House candidate across the finish line.
[02:40:01.739 --> 02:40:03.659]  These are much more localized races.
[02:40:03.659 --> 02:40:07.680]  They usually have a more intimate relationship with the voters.
[02:40:07.700 --> 02:40:12.600]  And so this is more about ground game than it is necessarily about party politics.
[02:40:13.090 --> 02:40:16.430]  And so I think we're going to find out what happens here.
[02:40:16.549 --> 02:40:17.649]  But yeah, I'm not...
[02:40:17.649 --> 02:40:22.190]  I mean, you know last night I thought for sure that the Republicans would maintain the House.
[02:40:22.709 --> 02:40:26.829]  But right now I'm saying there's still a lot of results that need to come in.
[02:40:26.829 --> 02:40:28.209]  It's hanging in the balance.
[02:40:29.950 --> 02:40:35.290]  Yes, Politico is reporting GOP trifecta on the line with House control and limbo.
[02:40:35.989 --> 02:40:44.309]  The majority in the chamber is expected to be slim no matter who wins, meaning a call on house control could take days or weeks.
[02:40:44.469 --> 02:40:46.590]  So basically saying the same thing you're saying.
[02:40:47.090 --> 02:40:52.569]  And this, you know, just came out basically.
[02:40:53.469 --> 02:40:56.790]  So that's what we said last night.
[02:40:57.350 --> 02:41:02.430]  We need a decisive victory, and this has been happening a lot.
[02:41:02.790 --> 02:41:12.059]  They almost, what, in 2022, This is just disgusting.
[02:41:12.500 --> 02:41:13.739]  We need the trifecta.
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:19.200]  What's so strange, and again, this is something I think the Republicans really need to study for the future.
[02:41:20.159 --> 02:41:26.420]  It shows that Trump is more popular than some of these Senate candidates and some of these House candidates, right?
[02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:28.760]  I mean, so Trump is the one carrying the ticket.
[02:41:29.319 --> 02:41:31.139]  Trump is clearly the populist candidate.
[02:41:31.559 --> 02:41:43.680]  And so maybe they can look at some of these issues and Maybe they can look at some of the campaign strategies, but that's something the Republicans definitely need to look at.
[02:41:43.879 --> 02:41:50.979]  How is it that Donald Trump can't carry our Senate candidates across the finish line in these states, assuming everything is fair and equal?
[02:41:57.030 --> 02:41:58.229]  Certainly could be money.
[02:41:58.590 --> 02:42:08.729]  And I also think that maybe the GOP and the RNC were so focused on Trump getting over the line that maybe they ignored some of these races that they should have been focused on.
[02:42:08.930 --> 02:42:12.149]  I mean, you shouldn't lose a House race in Alabama.
[02:42:12.569 --> 02:42:14.389]  I mean, you just straight up shouldn't lose that.
[02:42:14.750 --> 02:42:25.770]  And even in a state like New York, where Trump was outperforming other Republican candidates, you'd like to see your House candidates do better there.
[02:42:36.889 --> 02:42:41.930]  I don't like 99% in.
[02:42:42.370 --> 02:42:44.350]  You're up by almost 1,000.
[02:42:44.450 --> 02:42:45.569]  I know it's razor thin.
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:48.860]  I just don't like that they haven't called it yet.
[02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:51.219]  That's why I'm sitting here today.
[02:42:51.219 --> 02:42:53.440]  I understand what you're saying, and that's how it works.
[02:42:53.540 --> 02:43:00.920]  That's why all over the country, the Democrats say, oh, we're going to count for days after, and we don't need postmarks, and we just pulled these out of our butt.
[02:43:01.860 --> 02:43:11.040]  We're good to go.
[02:43:25.309 --> 02:43:27.930]  Even in 2020 and 2022.
[02:43:28.250 --> 02:43:28.989]  Oh, it's closed.
[02:43:29.170 --> 02:43:29.889]  We're not tabulating.
[02:43:30.090 --> 02:43:31.030]  Cover up the windows.
[02:43:31.270 --> 02:43:33.590]  Then the Republicans sue and get the footage.
[02:43:34.430 --> 02:43:37.190]  And they're cramming the same ballots over and over again in the machine.
[02:43:37.489 --> 02:43:39.350]  And then Giuliani talks about it.
[02:43:39.430 --> 02:43:40.989]  And they have a rigged trial.
[02:43:40.989 --> 02:43:43.049]  And he loses 80-something million dollars.
[02:43:44.649 --> 02:43:46.690]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:43:47.049 --> 02:43:49.090]  It's absolutely nuts.
[02:43:49.590 --> 02:43:52.969]  The good news is everybody knows about the fraud.
[02:43:52.969 --> 02:43:54.250]  And there's more and more heat on it.
[02:43:54.370 --> 02:43:58.950]  And Trump has pledged when he gets into the White House that he's going to try to go to paper ballots.
[02:43:59.110 --> 02:44:01.250]  That is really paramount, isn't it?
[02:44:01.750 --> 02:44:04.629]  It has to be done, and you have to get rid of mail-in voting.
[02:44:04.889 --> 02:44:11.110]  You have to have a nationwide mandate to purge the voter rolls of ineligible voters.
[02:44:11.270 --> 02:44:17.370]  I mean, really, it's probably five things you can do to really sure up the faith and the integrity of our elections.
[02:44:17.729 --> 02:44:20.629]  Guys, give me Northern Ohio here real quick, too.
[02:44:21.229 --> 02:44:22.430]  You know, this is another one.
[02:44:22.569 --> 02:44:24.530]  Again, it's so tight here.
[02:44:25.069 --> 02:44:27.290]  We're talking about just over a thousand votes.
[02:44:27.469 --> 02:44:28.110]  It's so tight.
[02:44:28.450 --> 02:44:29.370]  Owen, stay there.
[02:44:29.590 --> 02:44:31.750]  You're on an hour and five minutes.
[02:44:32.649 --> 02:44:33.290]  Doing your show.
[02:44:33.450 --> 02:44:35.569]  And we've got General Flynn and a bunch of other folks coming up.
[02:44:35.590 --> 02:44:37.290]  And I've got to get to them dropping the charges.
[02:44:37.489 --> 02:44:38.950]  But then promising to bring more.
[02:44:39.409 --> 02:44:39.989]  Coming up.
[02:44:40.069 --> 02:44:41.290]  A lot of big developments there.
[02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:42.030]  Stay there.
[02:44:42.110 --> 02:44:43.010]  We'll do five more minutes with you.
[02:44:43.090 --> 02:44:44.569]  Then I'm going to get into all these clips I didn't get to.
[02:44:44.649 --> 02:44:47.590]  And the Democrats promising to launch the deep state on Trump.
[02:44:47.629 --> 02:44:48.389]  And that's their savior.
[02:44:48.510 --> 02:44:49.590]  Admitting they're against the people.
[02:44:50.290 --> 02:44:57.709]  We've got people on CNN blaming black men and Hispanic men for being racist for Trump getting elected.
[02:44:57.709 --> 02:44:58.489]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:44:58.649 --> 02:44:59.510]  That's all coming up.
[02:45:00.239 --> 02:45:02.040]  Next hour, jam-packed.
[02:45:02.079 --> 02:45:04.139]  Then Owen Schroyer, the war room today.
[02:45:04.700 --> 02:45:05.500]  We'll go to break.
[02:45:05.739 --> 02:45:09.379]  Listen, InfoWars is up for sale on Tuesday.
[02:45:09.659 --> 02:45:10.979]  The bad guys say they're going to buy it.
[02:45:11.079 --> 02:45:12.139]  I don't know if we'll be here.
[02:45:12.260 --> 02:45:13.360]  I don't want to jinx it.
[02:45:13.659 --> 02:45:15.100]  I think it's still up in the air.
[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:19.000]  I currently have a bad feeling.
[02:45:19.579 --> 02:45:23.059]  All I'm saying is you want to have all us on the air.

[02:48:03.700 --> 02:48:04.620]  It's a post-workout.
[02:48:04.739 --> 02:48:08.399]  You've got to go read all the ingredients that are in this bad boy.
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:18.340]  And then look at the insane low prices between 30 and 50% off depending on how many canisters you get of Ultimate Hydro Force.
[02:48:18.620 --> 02:48:25.200]  Now again, go look at the ingredients for yourself and the quality of the ingredients and the amount of the ingredients.
[02:48:25.459 --> 02:48:27.540]  This baby is next level.
[02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:33.520]  This is beyond anything out there at anywhere near this low price.
[02:48:34.149 --> 02:48:44.569]  As you know, I always seek to bring you the very best supplements possible so you get a great response, great effects, and you want to come back and get them again.
[02:48:44.569 --> 02:48:47.090]  Like a restaurant wants to have tasty, good, delicious food.
[02:48:47.149 --> 02:48:48.530]  So there's a line out the door.
[02:48:48.850 --> 02:48:57.030]  Well, I've got to admit some false advertising, and next time we reproduce this, or my sponsors do, we're going to probably have to change the name.
[02:48:57.329 --> 02:48:58.610]  And why is that?
[02:48:58.729 --> 02:48:59.309]  Well, it's simple.
[02:48:59.409 --> 02:49:03.290]  This is called Ultimate Hydroforce Electrolyte Drink Mix.
[02:49:03.899 --> 02:49:07.520]  But it's really a superfood post-workout, pre-workout.
[02:49:07.659 --> 02:49:11.360]  That's why it's Ultimate HydroForce and more, I guess you'd say.
[02:49:12.340 --> 02:49:17.959]  Hydration, energy, vitamins, minerals, health, immune system.
[02:49:18.319 --> 02:49:21.319]  Get your HydroForce exclusively at TheAlexShowStore.com.
[02:49:31.670 --> 02:49:32.969]  Alright, we've got a compilation.
[02:49:33.090 --> 02:49:34.129]  I can't help it.
[02:49:34.370 --> 02:49:36.870]  I'm like, we're not going to show the left blowing up and melting down.
[02:49:37.389 --> 02:49:38.510]  But these are victims.
[02:49:38.510 --> 02:49:40.809]  But we are going to show how dangerous and crazy they are coming up.
[02:49:40.889 --> 02:49:41.690]  And then all these other clips.
[02:49:41.870 --> 02:49:43.149]  And then General Flynn at the bottom of the hour.
[02:49:43.270 --> 02:49:44.729]  Roger Stone's meeting with Trump right now.
[02:49:45.489 --> 02:49:47.010]  So he should be joining us after that.
[02:49:47.129 --> 02:49:49.030]  Or if not, he's going to give you the update with Owen.
[02:49:49.629 --> 02:49:53.030]  So that could be coming after her press conference at 3 or her speech.
[02:49:53.030 --> 02:49:54.389]  I think it'll be a speech where she...
[02:49:55.430 --> 02:49:58.989]  She didn't do it last night, but I think they know it looks really bad, so she is.
[02:49:59.569 --> 02:50:01.610]  But Owen, you've got the next five minutes.
[02:50:01.709 --> 02:50:05.209]  Host this segment and finish up with your views on how we fix this and what's coming next.
[02:50:07.719 --> 02:50:13.559]  Alright, so I'm looking at some of these races and I'm just thinking to myself, what went wrong for the Republicans?
[02:50:13.559 --> 02:50:14.899]  Did they not put enough money?
[02:50:14.979 --> 02:50:16.100]  Did they not put enough focus?
[02:50:16.700 --> 02:50:30.520]  Why did Trump do better in some of these areas than the House candidates, like in a northern Ohio or in an Alabama or in some of these other seats that the Democrats were able to flip, even in New York?
[02:50:31.799 --> 02:50:37.520]  You know, Iowa, maybe you can understand with Des Moines there, but it looks like they will hold on to that seat.
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:38.899]  We'll have to keep an eye on that, folks.
[02:50:39.040 --> 02:50:44.659]  I mean, one dump of mail-in ballots tomorrow at midnight can flip that to the Democrats.
[02:50:44.659 --> 02:50:54.280]  So we're really going to need to watch that Iowa District 1 and this Maryland district over here, too, that is literally 50-50 split.
[02:50:55.040 --> 02:51:00.500]  I mean, it's almost impossible to even believe that these numbers are possible.
[02:51:00.700 --> 02:51:01.719]  It looks like we've been...
[02:51:01.719 --> 02:51:02.860]  Yeah, okay, so there it is.
[02:51:02.940 --> 02:51:08.979]  I mean, we're talking about just a couple hundred votes separating these two candidates.
[02:51:09.639 --> 02:51:13.459]  And again, these are districts that Republicans really...
[02:51:17.659 --> 02:51:21.780]  We're good to go.
[02:51:46.159 --> 02:51:51.100]  We're good to go.
[02:52:01.049 --> 02:52:08.950]  But you should be getting similar victories, I would say, in northern Ohio and in Alabama in these areas that you lost.
[02:52:09.829 --> 02:52:16.610]  So I think something needs to be looked into for the Republicans to figure out what went wrong in these areas.
[02:52:16.610 --> 02:52:19.409]  But the House is on the balance.
[02:52:19.610 --> 02:52:27.739]  It is hanging by a thread right now for the Republicans to And I just hope that the RNC is watching these races closely.
[02:52:27.739 --> 02:52:30.000]  Now, here's the big story.
[02:52:30.120 --> 02:52:34.159]  If we have the presidential map, we should pull that up.
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:39.020]  It looks like when this is all said and done, you're going to have...
[02:52:39.020 --> 02:52:45.020]  I mean, basically you already have the same result from 2016.
[02:52:45.659 --> 02:52:51.340]  This is virtually what we have on the map, the same result as the 2016 presidential election.
[02:52:51.340 --> 02:53:00.280]  And when you look at the votes, Trump, it looks like, is either going to get about the same amount of votes or even less than he got in 2016.
[02:53:00.979 --> 02:53:03.540]  Harris is on pace to get maybe...
[02:53:04.719 --> 02:53:09.520]  Ten or more million less votes than Joe Biden.
[02:53:10.280 --> 02:53:19.760]  And so you already have big Democrats at the DNC, Hillary campaign staffers and all these other people, former staffers.
[02:53:19.860 --> 02:53:22.319]  They're all saying, oh, something's wrong here.
[02:53:22.440 --> 02:53:23.739]  What happened to the Harris votes?
[02:53:23.979 --> 02:53:26.139]  They haven't decided how to approach this yet.
[02:53:27.219 --> 02:53:28.319]  They don't know how.
[02:53:28.479 --> 02:53:29.639]  Are they going to blame Russia?
[02:53:29.639 --> 02:53:31.079]  Are they going to claim a stolen election?
[02:53:31.260 --> 02:53:36.739]  They don't really know how to approach this yet because they're the ones that have been saying, oh, it's a conspiracy.
[02:53:37.079 --> 02:53:38.260]  There are no stolen elections.
[02:53:38.559 --> 02:53:43.659]  So I don't know what they're going to do here, but this is your big elephant in the room right here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53:44.510 --> 02:53:47.569]  That's your big elephant in the room, and it's either one of two things.
[02:53:47.809 --> 02:53:59.149]  Either it's the total proof that it was voter fraud that got Joe Biden in, or the Democrats have to look themselves in the eye and say, was Kamala Harris really that bad of a candidate?
[02:53:59.149 --> 02:54:01.850]  Why did we go with her instead of Joe Biden?
[02:54:01.889 --> 02:54:07.969]  And why did we all jump on board for the worst ticket in the history of a presidential race?
[02:54:08.629 --> 02:54:10.250]  And the results here...
[02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:14.780]  Alright, I've got a ton of really interesting, informative video clips that I haven't gotten to.
[02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:16.180]  So I want to start...
[02:54:17.520 --> 02:54:18.180]  Going to those.
[02:54:18.299 --> 02:54:23.219]  But these first clips I played in the second hour, the beginning of it, I want to play those again.
[02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:34.379]  I just want to go to all of these because it paints a picture of what I already know they're up to, that you know what they're up to, but it's just them basically in between promising to come after everybody and we're not done yet.
[02:54:34.500 --> 02:54:35.659]  The deep state's going to get you.
[02:54:35.959 --> 02:54:36.799]  Play Chris Hayes first.
[02:54:37.139 --> 02:54:37.760]  Haven't played that yet.
[02:54:37.940 --> 02:54:40.719]  And then I want to show other globalists being very honest.
[02:54:41.100 --> 02:54:42.780]  This is not Trump's party.
[02:54:42.860 --> 02:54:43.799]  This is Trump's country.
[02:54:43.959 --> 02:54:45.079]  Well, it's the American people's country.
[02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:45.700]  We're taking it back.
[02:54:46.090 --> 02:54:48.610]  CNN trying to cope with the Trump win.
[02:54:48.790 --> 02:54:49.870]  Jake Tapper, Anderson Cooper.
[02:54:50.090 --> 02:54:51.670]  This is the greatest comeback in history.
[02:54:52.670 --> 02:54:53.829]  CNN's Scott Jennings.
[02:54:53.969 --> 02:54:57.450]  This is revenge of the working class American.
[02:54:58.329 --> 02:55:03.989]  Then we've got other leftists saying, no, no, everyone's really just racist.
[02:55:04.649 --> 02:55:07.670]  The Hispanics and blacks are now racist against themselves.
[02:55:08.370 --> 02:55:10.489]  It's just wild.
[02:55:10.750 --> 02:55:13.229]  But here is Chris Hayes first.
[02:55:17.059 --> 02:55:18.459]  The House, we're not going to know for weeks.
[02:55:18.540 --> 02:55:24.620]  But it's possible that Donald Trump and the Republicans will have a trifecta, as they did in 2016.
[02:55:25.159 --> 02:55:41.280]  In which case, the bulwark against whatever overreach there could be, and whatever those depredations might be, and I think you're going to have a tendency to overreach if they do, is the kind of thing that's democracy between elections.
[02:55:41.540 --> 02:55:43.500]  Which is the work of civil society.
[02:55:43.659 --> 02:55:44.760]  It's the work of the fourth estate.
[02:55:44.959 --> 02:55:45.879]  It's the work of institutions.
[02:55:45.879 --> 02:55:46.920]  It's the work of citizens.
[02:55:47.780 --> 02:55:49.459]  All that super important stuff.
[02:55:49.620 --> 02:55:50.420]  We've seen it before.
[02:55:50.879 --> 02:55:52.899]  And, you know, this is his party.
[02:55:53.340 --> 02:55:53.879]  This is...
[02:55:53.879 --> 02:55:55.620]  These voters...
[02:55:55.620 --> 02:55:55.959]  It's not just his party.
[02:55:56.139 --> 02:55:56.520]  What?
[02:55:56.639 --> 02:55:58.000]  It's not just his party now.
[02:55:58.299 --> 02:55:59.399]  No, it's his country.
[02:55:59.440 --> 02:55:59.879]  I mean...
[02:56:00.450 --> 02:56:01.790]  Again, we have to be careful.
[02:56:01.950 --> 02:56:07.450]  We haven't called it yet, but Pennsylvania makes it extremely tough for Kamala Harris.
[02:56:07.670 --> 02:56:10.430]  And that's one of the things, I mean, that the Trump side...
[02:56:10.430 --> 02:56:17.170]  And Anderson, it is hard to think of a political comeback that is actually more significant than this one.
[02:56:17.270 --> 02:56:22.850]  I'm tempted to say Richard Nixon, but that really falls short of what Donald Trump has achieved.
[02:56:23.389 --> 02:56:30.829]  Yeah, I mean, winning not just the electoral votes, but the popular vote as well.
[02:56:31.149 --> 02:56:32.049]  This is a mandate.
[02:56:32.930 --> 02:56:38.870]  He's won the national popular vote for a Republican for the first time since 2004.
[02:56:40.090 --> 02:56:41.270]  This is a big deal.
[02:56:41.569 --> 02:56:43.610]  This isn't backing into the office.
[02:56:44.290 --> 02:56:47.889]  This is a mandate to do what you said you were going to do.
[02:56:48.610 --> 02:56:52.270]  Get the economy working again for regular working class Americans.
[02:56:53.209 --> 02:56:58.790]  Fix immigration, try to get crime under control, try to reduce the chaos in the world.
[02:56:58.930 --> 02:57:01.590]  This is a mandate from the American people to do that.
[02:57:01.809 --> 02:57:11.469]  I think I'm interpreting the results tonight as the revenge of just a regular old working class American, the anonymous American who has been crushed.
[02:57:15.610 --> 02:57:19.510]  We're good to go.
[02:57:40.290 --> 02:57:46.149]  I mean, we've been sitting around here for the last couple of weeks, and the story that was portrayed was not true.
[02:57:46.989 --> 02:57:49.629]  I mean, we were told Puerto Rico was going to change the election.
[02:57:49.909 --> 02:57:53.389]  Liz Cheney, Nikki Haley voters, women lying to their husbands.
[02:57:53.629 --> 02:57:56.409]  Before that, it was Tim Walz and the camo hats.
[02:57:57.129 --> 02:58:05.290]  Night after night after night, we were told all these things and gimmicks were going to somehow push Harris over the line.
[02:58:05.569 --> 02:58:07.649]  And we were just ignoring the fundamentals.
[02:58:08.409 --> 02:58:12.959]  Inflation, People feeling like that they were barely able to tread water at best.
[02:58:13.479 --> 02:58:15.120]  That was the fundamentals of the election.
[02:58:15.780 --> 02:58:22.180]  And so I think that both parties should always look at the results of an election and figure out what went right and what went wrong.
[02:58:22.680 --> 02:58:36.020]  But I think for all of us who cover elections and talk about elections and do this on a day-to-day basis, we have to figure out how to understand, talk to, and listen to the half of the country that rose up tonight and said, we've had enough.
[02:58:38.319 --> 02:58:39.360]  And they're speechless.
[02:58:41.739 --> 02:58:44.319]  Now, here's the big question.
[02:58:44.459 --> 02:58:49.139]  If Trump doesn't get the House, it's always the same.
[02:58:50.059 --> 02:58:55.299]  They keep it open for days or weeks, and they get whatever ballots they need so that they get the House.
[02:58:56.540 --> 02:58:57.500]  And it's the fraud.
[02:58:58.219 --> 02:59:07.010]  But people are so awake to it, and now the process of exposing it, and the eyes on it, and the money being spent to fight it, Is we're going in the right direction.
[02:59:07.190 --> 02:59:10.590]  So as negative as this is, at least we're in the fight now and not asleep.
[02:59:11.549 --> 02:59:14.090]  So that's good, and that's the beginning of end of them.
[02:59:14.149 --> 02:59:24.569]  But here's Chris Wallace again, draining the energy from the CNN studio, announcing Trump may soon have the chance to reshape the U.S. government.
[02:59:25.110 --> 02:59:27.110]  Well, yeah, that's what this is all about.
[02:59:27.110 --> 02:59:27.709]  Here it is.
[02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:44.079]  I mean, let's talk about the significance of a Republican Senate if, and I repeat, if Donald Trump is elected president, it means that they can We can confirm without any Democratic votes, any appointment he makes to his cabinet,
[02:59:44.360 --> 02:59:48.500]  to the government, to the Supreme Court should there be a vacancy.
[02:59:48.680 --> 02:59:52.260]  It's an enormous advantage to a president.
[02:59:52.500 --> 03:00:01.899]  And at this point, we haven't talked about it much, but in the House, although that hasn't been decided yet, the Republicans have flipped three Democratic seats.
[03:00:02.409 --> 03:00:19.149]  The Democrats haven't flipped a single Republican seat, so there is the possibility here of a complete united Republican government with Donald Trump as the president and with a Republican House and Senate, which means that in terms of appointments, in terms of immigration policy,
[03:00:19.309 --> 03:00:25.569]  economic policy, environmental policy, you name it, he could have pretty blank checks.
[03:00:25.850 --> 03:00:27.829]  And now he does, partially.
[03:00:29.110 --> 03:00:32.670]  But none of it doesn't get the House, but the confirmation of the Senate is big.
[03:00:34.090 --> 03:00:35.510]  Now, I want to play a clip here.
[03:00:35.809 --> 03:00:40.510]  NBC blamed Biden for Kamala losing because he dropped out too late.
[03:00:41.010 --> 03:00:52.370]  So, she got less than 2% in polls, never stood at the primaries, was the most unpopular Democrat candidate I've ever heard of, who was, you know, in the debates.
[03:00:53.250 --> 03:00:53.729]  And...
[03:00:55.690 --> 03:00:57.829]  The more they saw her, the more they hated her.
[03:00:58.049 --> 03:01:00.170]  So it would have been worse if she...
[03:01:00.170 --> 03:01:02.270]  If he'd have dropped out a year ago.
[03:01:02.469 --> 03:01:03.629]  I mean, that's a no-brainer.
[03:01:03.909 --> 03:01:07.370]  So here they are not admitting to themselves what they really did.
[03:01:07.489 --> 03:01:10.790]  But on NBC, Jen Psaki was on there.
[03:01:11.670 --> 03:01:17.110]  NBC questions whether Democrat coup against Biden was right move as Harris' election failed.
[03:01:18.290 --> 03:01:19.770]  So, yeah.
[03:01:21.149 --> 03:01:21.670]  Absolutely.
[03:01:21.670 --> 03:01:23.530]  As horrible as Biden was...
[03:01:24.340 --> 03:01:25.520]  And he's a super creep.
[03:01:25.760 --> 03:01:29.360]  I mean, he's a 9.5 on a scale of 1 to 10.
[03:01:29.399 --> 03:01:32.079]  And Harris and Walls together are 100.
[03:01:32.319 --> 03:01:33.760]  I mean, it's not even an 11.
[03:01:33.899 --> 03:01:35.799]  It's like a joke.
[03:01:35.959 --> 03:01:37.020]  It's like hell opened up.
[03:01:37.459 --> 03:01:43.340]  They're so freakish and fake and disgusting and reviled that it's like...
[03:01:43.340 --> 03:01:44.940]  And then her husband.
[03:01:45.219 --> 03:01:47.360]  And then Walls' wife.
[03:01:47.540 --> 03:01:49.399]  I mean, where do you find these people?
[03:01:50.260 --> 03:01:54.920]  I mean, they are the most disingenuous, revolting people I've ever seen.
[03:01:54.920 --> 03:01:58.940]  And that's emblematic of the devil's people.
[03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:04.319]  But it's just mind-blowing.
[03:02:04.500 --> 03:02:06.059]  Here's NBC blaming Biden.
[03:02:07.239 --> 03:02:25.040]  That's what makes the timing, I think, of President Biden's decision to step down after the debate something that if she does in fact lose will be under a microscope because of course there was so much discussion even over the summer about potentially having an open primary and having that fight play out within the Democratic Party.
[03:02:25.299 --> 03:02:28.579]  So I think it's one of the big questions moving forward.
[03:02:28.780 --> 03:02:35.540]  Jen, has the conversation begun yet about Joe Biden and about the decision to ask him to step aside?
[03:02:35.940 --> 03:02:36.860]  It will begin.
[03:02:37.180 --> 03:02:38.979]  It will begin depending on the outcome.
[03:02:39.479 --> 03:02:42.200]  And obviously, there hasn't been a race called yet.
[03:02:42.360 --> 03:02:46.180]  If this is not a Harris win, that will certainly be part of the discussion.
[03:02:47.219 --> 03:02:50.260]  She's run a campaign over the course of 107 days.
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:52.680]  That is not something we've seen in history.
[03:02:53.239 --> 03:02:58.459]  And there'll be lots of questions about exactly that, the timing and the impact of that.
[03:02:58.590 --> 03:03:06.209]  Well, Chuck was bringing up the history, I mean, in terms of vice presidents trying to win the presidency with an unpopular president.
[03:03:06.209 --> 03:03:09.409]  He said it's bordering on politically impossible.
[03:03:09.649 --> 03:03:15.489]  And this gets- Their tyranny is out in the open.
[03:03:16.629 --> 03:03:18.110]  And that's a very positive thing.
[03:03:18.569 --> 03:03:22.729]  I mean, tyranny's not a good thing, but if you're going to have it, you might as well admit it's there and get rid of it.
[03:03:22.909 --> 03:03:31.829]  And admitting it's there is the first step, like admitting that the poison mRNA shots are not vaccines and are designed to erase your immune system and slowly kill you.
[03:03:32.590 --> 03:03:36.530]  And it's killed over 30 million people, according to Global Insurance Actuaries.
[03:03:37.889 --> 03:03:46.809]  And Trump told Kennedy, RFK Jr., that he is going to release the government databases that are secret, but that we know are there.
[03:03:47.209 --> 03:03:51.030]  Because they're studying what the shots do, and that's come out.
[03:03:51.149 --> 03:03:53.090]  And the other governments do it as well.
[03:03:53.569 --> 03:04:07.229]  They're euthanizing the old people while mitigating and creating sterilants that don't sterilize everybody, but lower fertility in everybody and destroy it in some, depending on your genetics.
[03:04:08.039 --> 03:04:09.540]  And your predisposition.
[03:04:11.520 --> 03:04:11.940]  So...
[03:04:11.940 --> 03:04:14.620]  These people see us as cockroaches.
[03:04:14.799 --> 03:04:16.459]  And they tell you there's too many of you.
[03:04:16.719 --> 03:04:18.420]  And then they say they want to do it.
[03:04:19.700 --> 03:04:21.020]  And so...
[03:04:21.020 --> 03:04:24.299]  My job would be so easy...
[03:04:24.299 --> 03:04:27.540]  If people would just study what the globalists say.
[03:04:27.559 --> 03:04:29.040]  I mean, we played on Monday...
[03:04:29.899 --> 03:04:31.540]  Yuval Noah Harari came out.
[03:04:31.600 --> 03:04:32.540]  Find that again, please.
[03:04:32.979 --> 03:04:33.700]  40-second clip.
[03:04:33.959 --> 03:04:37.079]  And he's the high priest of the WEF. I mean, what he says is what they all say.
[03:04:37.340 --> 03:04:39.440]  You can watch their forums, and they all say it.
[03:04:39.600 --> 03:04:40.719]  The future's not human.
[03:04:40.860 --> 03:04:41.600]  People are bad.
[03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:43.379]  The elite are about to become gods.
[03:04:43.620 --> 03:04:45.360]  We swear allegiance to the world government.
[03:04:45.540 --> 03:04:49.459]  And he's like, you know, these nationalists, they just won't swear allegiance to their global government.
[03:04:50.180 --> 03:04:52.239]  And that's why, you know, humanity's doomed.
[03:04:52.239 --> 03:04:53.959]  While they shut down humanity.
[03:04:54.819 --> 03:04:57.219]  And then you got New York Times articles, Alex Jones is crazy.
[03:04:57.219 --> 03:04:59.559]  There's no such thing as the new world order in the global government?
[03:04:59.959 --> 03:05:08.000]  No, they're just setting up the world currency and the NATO is the world army and world censorship bureaus and saying they want to use UN troops during the next lockdown.
[03:05:08.500 --> 03:05:10.500]  The head of the WHO, the...
[03:05:11.520 --> 03:05:17.840]  Fauci's mini-me, the head of Alphabet that controls Google and everything, Eric Schmidt, played the clips.
[03:05:18.079 --> 03:05:26.159]  He was at Stanford two months ago, and he's like, yeah, we need to use NATO and the UN to censor people during the next pandemic and maybe even arrest them.
[03:05:26.860 --> 03:05:27.600]  I mean...
[03:05:31.340 --> 03:05:45.420]  I know it's the State Department of Random 7277's public law, and I know they've always planned to disarm the people and the police and then bring in UN peacekeepers, but even I would look at that from the 60s and say, okay, that is a U.S. law.
[03:05:45.540 --> 03:05:46.219]  That's still there.
[03:05:47.930 --> 03:05:49.610]  And the UN goes around and takes over countries all the time.
[03:05:49.670 --> 03:05:51.149]  But I'm like, really, UN troops?
[03:05:51.690 --> 03:05:53.549]  Instead, it's just UN policy we live under.
[03:05:53.709 --> 03:05:56.489]  And then our bureaucrats follow the UNESCO treaties.
[03:05:56.909 --> 03:05:59.450]  And Trump pulled out of most of those when he's about to do it again.
[03:06:00.370 --> 03:06:02.069]  And Musk is saying, just get out of it completely.
[03:06:02.069 --> 03:06:02.829]  I totally agree.
[03:06:03.030 --> 03:06:04.250]  And that's how far we've come.
[03:06:04.409 --> 03:06:13.489]  But imagine an unelected world government, the totalitarian nature of which is incredible, whose official UN small arms board...
[03:06:13.510 --> 03:06:20.930]  Now, UNIDIR, look it up, for the year 2000, says they want to have an abolition of civilian firearm ownership, period.
[03:06:21.290 --> 03:06:27.149]  And they say any civilian ownership of firearms threatens a legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[03:06:27.329 --> 03:06:28.030]  That's a quote.
[03:06:28.409 --> 03:06:30.190]  I haven't shown that UNIDIR document in years.
[03:06:30.270 --> 03:06:31.049]  I'm sure somebody can find it.
[03:06:31.329 --> 03:06:32.170]  Guys, type in...
[03:06:34.340 --> 03:06:38.000]  UNIDIR, that's a UN conference on blah, blah, blah, small arms.
[03:06:38.120 --> 03:06:46.200]  I forget the exact, what the acronym stands for, but it's the UN global body and it puts it out and then the member states say they'll adopt it because they're signatories via a treaty of that.
[03:06:46.520 --> 03:06:49.639]  It's like all those UN treaties, like UNESCO over education.
[03:06:49.780 --> 03:06:52.319]  You wonder why the education is the same in Australia, it's the same here and the same in Germany?
[03:06:52.659 --> 03:06:55.440]  Teaching five-year-olds how to, you know, get blowjobs?
[03:06:56.579 --> 03:06:56.940]  Um...
[03:06:58.060 --> 03:07:06.159]  It's the UN. And then the UN rules go to the ESG through the banks in BlackRock, and they tell corporations, you'll promote this, or you won't get a good corporate credit score.
[03:07:06.299 --> 03:07:10.600]  And then now they'll have your personal one that China already has, and then they'll punish you if you don't.
[03:07:11.579 --> 03:07:16.719]  So if you don't take your kid to be brainwashed by the pedo cult, you will be downgraded.
[03:07:17.159 --> 03:07:21.239]  If you own a car, somehow, you'll be downgraded.
[03:07:21.659 --> 03:07:23.819]  I mean, this is admitted.
[03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:30.420]  I mean, Larry Fink said last year, we're going to control behavior with a global ESG and then implement it on the general public as a social credit score.
[03:07:30.719 --> 03:07:37.459]  And they're going to make everybody so poor that you'll be begging for the universal basic income with all the strings that come attached with that.
[03:07:39.319 --> 03:07:40.059]  Yeah, there it is.
[03:07:40.260 --> 03:07:45.139]  Compliance and Enforcement in WMD-related Treaties.
[03:07:46.420 --> 03:07:51.780]  And they call Civilian Firearms WMD. And that's a unit here.
[03:07:51.899 --> 03:07:57.020]  The United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research.
[03:07:57.379 --> 03:08:02.920]  And it runs the gamut from nuclear weapons to chemical weapons to palacers to fighter jets to cruise missiles to...
[03:08:03.639 --> 03:08:05.700]  And then right down to your grandpa's shotgun.
[03:08:06.379 --> 03:08:09.479]  They got a bunch of documents, but let me tell you the exact words of the document.
[03:08:10.079 --> 03:08:25.440]  Just type in UNIDIR UNIDIR CONVENTION UNIDIR And you just type in,
[03:08:26.239 --> 03:08:32.639]  civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[03:08:32.799 --> 03:08:41.180]  And it's a resolution they passed to the full UN that passed and the Security Council signed off on as official UN policy.
[03:08:41.879 --> 03:08:45.059]  And if you're a signatory, you're supposed to do what they say, but we haven't done that.
[03:08:45.120 --> 03:08:45.799]  Everybody else did.
[03:08:45.940 --> 03:08:47.059]  To take your guns.
[03:08:47.180 --> 03:08:48.920]  I guess us in Switzerland haven't done it.
[03:08:49.999 --> 03:08:52.379]  So, I mean, the world government isn't coming.
[03:08:52.600 --> 03:08:53.159]  It's here.
[03:08:53.620 --> 03:08:55.239]  And that's 24 years ago.
[03:08:56.239 --> 03:08:57.979]  So, yeah, they want your guns.
[03:08:57.979 --> 03:08:59.059]  It's their official policy.
[03:08:59.180 --> 03:09:00.059]  And they want to own your body.
[03:09:00.239 --> 03:09:03.719]  And they're saying, oh, all those COVID camps we built?
[03:09:04.200 --> 03:09:07.579]  Well, when the next pandemic comes, we're going to lock you up for your speech.
[03:09:07.579 --> 03:09:09.860]  And then now New York's trying to pass a law to do it.
[03:09:10.200 --> 03:09:11.420]  And so is California.
[03:09:11.659 --> 03:09:12.639]  Do you get it yet?
[03:09:14.120 --> 03:09:16.319]  They're going to try to launch this takeover.
[03:09:17.840 --> 03:09:26.260]  They say at the UN for decades, we'll use a global pandemic to bring in the world government and the world ID. And then they've openly said, oh yeah, COVID was a drill to do that.
[03:09:27.139 --> 03:09:31.020]  I know most of you know that up one side and down the other, but this is real.
[03:09:31.500 --> 03:09:34.379]  And now we've got Elon Musk talking about it.
[03:09:35.139 --> 03:09:39.639]  We're close because what they're doing is totally illegal, absolutely tyrannical.
[03:09:40.399 --> 03:09:46.200]  They admit they're going to make everybody poor and sterilize us and make us eat bugs and we'll own nothing and be happy.
[03:09:46.299 --> 03:09:53.850]  B.S. I mean, I am promoting the most common sense, decent proposals.
[03:09:55.309 --> 03:09:57.670]  And then they sit there and say, I'm a devil.
[03:09:58.350 --> 03:10:07.510]  Well, then look at what I support, what I'm pushing, what I'm exposing, and then ask yourself, do you want to support me or Klaus Schwab?
[03:10:07.530 --> 03:10:08.729]  You're like, well, I'll just stay out of it.
[03:10:08.870 --> 03:10:10.149]  You're not going to stay out of it.
[03:10:12.430 --> 03:10:13.750]  They're coming for you.
[03:10:13.809 --> 03:10:16.350]  You already experienced they launched their pandemic operation.
[03:10:16.729 --> 03:10:18.110]  People go, how did Jones predict it exactly?
[03:10:18.290 --> 03:10:19.770]  Because it's in their documents.
[03:10:20.989 --> 03:10:31.770]  Operation Lockstep, the Rockefeller Foundation, John Hopkins, and the WHO, they tell you everything they're going to do.
[03:10:32.170 --> 03:10:35.690]  2004, in the BioShield, federal law, was it $10 million?
[03:10:37.200 --> 03:10:44.420]  It's more than that, but it was like 6 billion, then 8 billion, then a bunch of packages to, quote, build bio-research labs to stop bio-attack from the country.
[03:10:44.680 --> 03:10:47.959]  And they actually built more bio-weapons labs under that.
[03:10:48.479 --> 03:10:51.139]  And then they built them over in Ukraine and everywhere else.
[03:10:51.219 --> 03:10:57.659]  And then they created millions of packages for FEMA. I think it was like, I forget how many millions.
[03:10:57.760 --> 03:10:59.500]  It was like 27 million or something.
[03:10:59.559 --> 03:11:00.040]  You look it up.
[03:11:01.520 --> 03:11:17.079]  Rodney Howard Brown actually still had one in his church he'd kept, thinking it was weird in 2004 when FEMA gave a bunch of the church, and it's a package, and it's got a mask and some gloves, and it tells them stay six feet apart and, you know, wear your mask and don't leave your house.
[03:11:18.600 --> 03:11:20.819]  And they already had that on the shelf.
[03:11:22.979 --> 03:11:25.239]  And I remembered it, and then I was telling Brown about it.
[03:11:25.319 --> 03:11:26.420]  He goes, wait a minute, I got that.
[03:11:26.879 --> 03:11:28.479]  And then he goes and covers it on air.
[03:11:31.010 --> 03:11:33.629]  Notice they didn't launch the attack though in 2004.
[03:11:34.870 --> 03:11:36.750]  They launched it in 2020.
[03:11:37.370 --> 03:11:41.430]  So we're just sitting here waiting for them to launch the next attack.
[03:11:41.629 --> 03:11:43.530]  Are you going to just sit there and take that?
[03:11:44.969 --> 03:11:46.750]  And now we got Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[03:11:46.909 --> 03:11:47.629]  who's going to be in the administration.
[03:11:48.170 --> 03:11:49.469]  They got a big problem.
[03:11:49.469 --> 03:11:51.270]  But we can't just hold them off.
[03:11:51.409 --> 03:11:58.649]  We've got to discredit them, defund them, and defeat them.
[03:11:59.799 --> 03:12:02.659]  Because they are the global government that's trying to totally take over.
[03:12:02.780 --> 03:12:04.319]  They are the exterminists.
[03:12:04.399 --> 03:12:05.120]  They are the death cult.
[03:12:05.239 --> 03:12:06.879]  They are the bad guys.
[03:12:09.139 --> 03:12:11.340]  So, I mean, this is my life.
[03:12:11.860 --> 03:12:13.260]  I don't want to be locked down.
[03:12:13.440 --> 03:12:16.780]  I don't want to be bug proteins already being put in most of the processed food.
[03:12:18.940 --> 03:12:21.840]  I don't want my children growing up in this world.
[03:12:24.250 --> 03:12:28.389]  I don't want to have World War III. I mean, this is just self-preservation.
[03:12:28.829 --> 03:12:30.290]  This isn't a show.
[03:12:30.590 --> 03:12:32.950]  This isn't some genre of politics.
[03:12:33.229 --> 03:12:49.969]  There's a global corporate government that wants to depopulate the earth, that believes they're going to become superhumans, that are just out of their minds, wanting us to pledge allegiance to a world government that's in the official UN plans and congressional testimony in the 60s and 70s.
[03:12:51.510 --> 03:13:11.260]  Arthur Spangler testified, In 1966, to the US Senate, and said everyone must take an allegiance to the UN and their world government,
[03:13:11.479 --> 03:13:13.959]  or they'll have to be eliminated.
[03:13:14.159 --> 03:13:15.700]  That's basically the exact quote.
[03:13:16.899 --> 03:13:18.180]  These people aren't...
[03:13:18.180 --> 03:13:19.440]  Did you hear what I just said?
[03:13:19.659 --> 03:13:21.719]  Look up Arthur Spangler UN quotes.
[03:13:22.180 --> 03:13:32.639]  And back when I was learning all this, when I was, you know, 18, 19 and really got into researching it, I would go to the UT library because I wasn't just going to believe the New American magazine.
[03:13:33.399 --> 03:13:35.819]  And every damn thing they said was true.
[03:13:36.200 --> 03:13:37.340]  And I got...
[03:13:38.129 --> 03:13:38.930]  The records.
[03:13:39.549 --> 03:13:40.870]  You've seen it in my films.
[03:13:41.270 --> 03:13:43.469]  Film of the microfilm.
[03:13:43.729 --> 03:13:46.729]  I didn't just believe David Rockefeller said Mao Zedong's great.
[03:13:46.870 --> 03:13:48.190]  We need to live under that here in America.
[03:13:50.489 --> 03:13:50.969]  1976.
[03:13:51.430 --> 03:13:54.850]  I went and got it at UT. Put it in my movies.
[03:13:57.010 --> 03:14:00.110]  And I'm like, Mao Zedong is good?
[03:14:00.389 --> 03:14:02.670]  He killed 80 million of his own people?
[03:14:08.420 --> 03:14:09.280]  Here's a compilation.
[03:14:09.500 --> 03:14:14.600]  It's up on X. I suggest you share it with Rollins Jones of the left completely flipping out with the Trump victory last night.
[03:14:14.860 --> 03:14:15.540]  Here it is.
[03:14:16.100 --> 03:14:17.360]  When did we get here?
[03:14:19.270 --> 03:14:20.649]  How did we get here?
[03:14:21.329 --> 03:14:25.290]  What in the Alice in Wonderland nightmares is going on right now?
[03:14:25.450 --> 03:14:29.610]  All I can say is how dare you.
[03:14:29.950 --> 03:14:39.870]  If you voted for that man, if you voted for anybody other than Kamala and you live in one of the states, that it was, you know, close.
[03:14:40.850 --> 03:14:42.170]  Or if you didn't vote.
[03:14:50.969 --> 03:14:52.790]  I chose family.
[03:14:53.049 --> 03:14:53.889]  I chose women.
[03:14:54.149 --> 03:14:55.250]  I chose America.
[03:14:55.709 --> 03:14:56.850]  I love you.
[03:14:57.129 --> 03:14:59.389]  How the is this still happening?
[03:14:59.709 --> 03:15:02.930]  All I've ever known politically is hatred.
[03:15:03.250 --> 03:15:03.829]  I'm done.
[03:15:04.370 --> 03:15:05.270]  I'm done.
[03:15:05.450 --> 03:15:06.010]  I'm done.
[03:15:06.530 --> 03:15:08.030]  I'm done with you.
[03:15:08.510 --> 03:15:11.409]  I'm done with you and your mother and your sister.
[03:15:11.709 --> 03:15:13.969]  I'm just done with all of this.
[03:15:26.399 --> 03:15:33.780]  If this guy does end up winning again, all of the people who voted for him will be like happy and they'll just be celebrating.
[03:15:34.180 --> 03:15:38.420]  And everyone else, everyone who feels threatened by him is fucking scared.
[03:15:38.739 --> 03:15:41.040]  Like we're scared for our lives.
[03:15:41.180 --> 03:15:42.340]  We're scared for our friends.
[03:15:42.459 --> 03:15:43.700]  How dare you?
[03:15:44.049 --> 03:15:52.049]  Put this man into office for another four years, knowing damn well what it means for our country, what it means for us as a people.
[03:15:52.350 --> 03:15:59.649]  To know that there is that much ignorance and that much hate in this country, it's so terrifying.
[03:16:00.690 --> 03:16:02.129]  It's so terrifying.
[03:16:02.729 --> 03:16:06.629]  How the are we back in this same situation again?
[03:16:08.870 --> 03:16:11.790]  Who the is voting for him?
[03:16:12.309 --> 03:16:12.950]  Genuinely.
[03:16:13.959 --> 03:16:17.139]  I don't want to hear about how shitty your life gets under his policies.
[03:16:22.319 --> 03:16:23.500]  Live with that decision.
[03:16:23.799 --> 03:16:24.399]  Sit with it.
[03:16:24.639 --> 03:16:26.180]  Let it make you uncomfortable.
[03:16:27.920 --> 03:16:28.360]  you.
[03:16:39.450 --> 03:16:46.030]  I respectfully ask you to pay attention to what I'm about to say because it is critical in three important ways.
[03:16:46.290 --> 03:16:48.629]  It'll keep my broadcast on the air.

[03:17:01.569 --> 03:17:04.549]  I've been promoting and selling CBD for more than 20 years.
[03:17:04.729 --> 03:17:08.989]  Everybody knows how amazing it is, but not all CBD is equal.
[03:17:09.540 --> 03:17:22.360]  This is a high quality, made in Texas, very strong CBD, thousand milligram tincture that has been put in nanoparticles, so it's eight to nine times stronger than regular CBD that already gives you great effects.
[03:17:22.959 --> 03:17:32.950]  On top of that, we private label it from a top company, That sells it to a bunch of other companies that sell it from between $140 to $90 to $76.
[03:17:33.569 --> 03:17:39.850]  This is the lowest price you're going to find on CBD of this quality anywhere in the market.
[03:17:40.069 --> 03:17:42.829]  The industry just massively marks it up.
[03:17:43.010 --> 03:17:49.299]  There's still some good margin in here for our sponsor To support their operation and support us.
[03:17:49.459 --> 03:17:51.100]  And then that savings is passed on to you.

[03:18:36.110 --> 03:18:45.450]  General Michael Flynn, America's general, one of Trump's top advisors and a man for the last four years that worked tirelessly across the country for voter integrity.
[03:18:46.049 --> 03:18:49.350]  Undoubtedly, if it wasn't for his work, we would not have had this victory.
[03:18:50.100 --> 03:18:58.739]  Last night, and he was the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, former top national security advisor, one of the most respected generals in modern history.
[03:18:59.340 --> 03:19:07.659]  And he can give you the 35,000 foot view right down to the one inch breakdown of what we're facing.
[03:19:08.260 --> 03:19:13.649]  And he's one of the few voices, and that's not a good thing, It's prominent.
[03:19:13.870 --> 03:19:24.870]  There's a lot of little folks out there that are great that are understanding we just won the biggest battle against the globalists in history and the biggest comeback in history.
[03:19:25.510 --> 03:19:27.049]  And they are off balance.
[03:19:27.170 --> 03:19:31.270]  They are desperate right now, but they are going to strike back.
[03:19:31.430 --> 03:19:38.370]  And I played clips earlier of different globalist pundits saying, oh, don't worry, the deep state will get him.
[03:19:39.020 --> 03:19:40.899]  So, we've got to protect the president.
[03:19:40.959 --> 03:19:42.000]  We've got to get him in.
[03:19:42.079 --> 03:19:43.059]  We've got to get good people in.
[03:19:43.139 --> 03:19:45.000]  And we've got to go on the offense against the bad guys.
[03:19:45.319 --> 03:19:47.860]  We've also got to turn the economy back on.
[03:19:47.959 --> 03:19:49.260]  We've got a tall order here.
[03:19:49.940 --> 03:19:51.020]  But we can do it.
[03:19:51.079 --> 03:19:51.920]  But I want to explain.
[03:19:52.180 --> 03:19:56.600]  We have to, as he said last night, we have to fight through the objective or press the attack.
[03:19:57.760 --> 03:19:58.159]  Okay?
[03:19:58.420 --> 03:19:59.819]  If we let up now...
[03:20:00.840 --> 03:20:04.520]  We'll be right back where we were when his first term, and they will overwhelm us.
[03:20:04.639 --> 03:20:06.040]  We have to go on offense.
[03:20:06.340 --> 03:20:09.079]  To explain that is General Flynn.
[03:20:09.379 --> 03:20:10.780]  General, thank you so much.
[03:20:11.040 --> 03:20:12.579]  You came on three times yesterday.
[03:20:12.579 --> 03:20:15.840]  I know you didn't get any sleep like I did, but I can see you're back at home.
[03:20:15.959 --> 03:20:18.760]  I'm going to try to give you the floor for the 25 minutes we have left.
[03:20:18.979 --> 03:20:20.100]  Sir, thank you so much.
[03:20:21.280 --> 03:20:23.739]  So, Alex, appreciate it.
[03:20:23.920 --> 03:20:35.920]  And I put something out this morning on my X post about fighting through the objective, and I gave an analogy of sort of the Normandy beach invasion, right?
[03:20:36.000 --> 03:20:41.100]  The European invasion of World War II, where, you know, it was D-Day, the D-Day invasion, very famous, right?
[03:20:41.260 --> 03:20:43.739]  And I say we're at D-Day plus one right now.
[03:20:44.329 --> 03:20:47.510]  We have not achieved victory over Europe yet.
[03:20:47.770 --> 03:20:56.069]  And the metaphor or the analogy is where what we're really facing is still an uncertain path ahead.
[03:20:56.129 --> 03:20:58.590]  We know who our leader is.
[03:20:58.690 --> 03:21:00.290]  We know what our formations are.
[03:21:00.409 --> 03:21:01.889]  We know what our resources are.
[03:21:02.010 --> 03:21:03.770]  We've sort of gathered our troops.
[03:21:03.889 --> 03:21:05.049]  We've fought through this major battle.
[03:21:05.690 --> 03:21:06.670]  D-Day invasion.
[03:21:06.909 --> 03:21:08.030]  We got the beachhead.
[03:21:08.309 --> 03:21:11.750]  We won a massive, massive, monumental victory.
[03:21:11.870 --> 03:21:24.229]  Without this victory that we got last night, over the last 24 hours, let's say, we could not now stand back up and begin to move forward and to achieve an even greater victory.
[03:21:24.309 --> 03:21:26.209]  And that's what I mean by fighting through the objective.
[03:21:26.469 --> 03:21:30.950]  So we can't just take a pause and everybody high-five.
[03:21:31.530 --> 03:21:33.770]  What I'm telling people is get some rest.
[03:21:34.290 --> 03:21:36.110]  You know, maybe take a day.
[03:21:36.489 --> 03:21:44.809]  And for those that are going to continue in this fight, and I know that there are a few of the big influencers out there, I call them, you know, the world of digital soldiers, right?
[03:21:44.950 --> 03:21:46.229]  I mean, this is a big, big battle.
[03:21:46.370 --> 03:21:47.590]  It's a big battle for information.
[03:21:48.049 --> 03:21:50.149]  And I think information dominance.
[03:21:50.530 --> 03:21:51.409]  And we won.
[03:21:51.790 --> 03:21:53.510]  We won that initial battle.
[03:21:53.709 --> 03:21:54.930]  It is a major victory.
[03:21:55.290 --> 03:22:04.950]  But going forward, One of the things that we always talk about in the military, and from my perspective, we always say the enemy has a vote.
[03:22:05.190 --> 03:22:06.329]  The enemy has a vote.
[03:22:06.450 --> 03:22:07.190]  So what does that mean?
[03:22:07.389 --> 03:22:19.190]  What that means is that the powers that we're up against, the globalists, the establishment, And the establishment is that swirl that operates inside of D.C. that is really politically aligned.
[03:22:19.309 --> 03:22:20.489]  And then you have the bureaucracy.
[03:22:20.489 --> 03:22:28.069]  And then you have the various institutions that are infiltrated by, in many cases, by the CCP, Chinese Communist Party.
[03:22:28.350 --> 03:22:39.209]  And then you have all of the other domestic challenges that we face, the illegal invasion, the drugs on the street, you know, rise of fentanyl, rise of crime, the border invasion, all these other aspects.
[03:22:39.469 --> 03:22:44.379]  So they still have And I mentioned this, I think, last night.
[03:22:44.440 --> 03:22:46.780]  I mentioned the idea of branches and sequels.
[03:22:46.959 --> 03:22:50.559]  A branch is a slight diversion off of your current plan.
[03:22:50.719 --> 03:22:57.659]  So if I'm on their team and I'm planning to counter this victory that we just lost, right?
[03:22:57.760 --> 03:22:59.260]  I mean, I'm looking at it from their standpoint.
[03:22:59.479 --> 03:23:02.840]  So I might have some diversions that I put into place.
[03:23:03.040 --> 03:23:05.979]  Or a sequel, I might have an entirely different...
[03:23:07.950 --> 03:23:09.610]  We're good to go.
[03:23:10.829 --> 03:23:13.969]  We're good to go.
[03:23:13.969 --> 03:23:34.510]  We're good to go.
[03:23:36.430 --> 03:23:41.250]  You know, fall back on their heels or fall back on their laurels and say, okay, we roll over, we give.
[03:23:41.450 --> 03:23:41.809]  No.
[03:23:42.290 --> 03:23:47.790]  And, you know, there's been all kinds of talk about, you know, the unification, and I'm all for that.
[03:23:47.950 --> 03:23:56.670]  I want to unify this country, and I actually think that the majority of this country is actually unified and focused on the kinds of things that Trump has been talking about.
[03:23:56.729 --> 03:23:59.209]  That's why he won with such a huge, huge mandate.
[03:23:59.770 --> 03:24:08.250]  But there is still an element out there that is this opposition force, and they're in control of our government still, so we still have about two and a half months to go.
[03:24:08.670 --> 03:24:24.450]  One of the things that I, and I keep saying this, and I hate to even raise it again, but one of the challenges that we have as a nation right now, because they've already tried it twice on Trump, is for Trump to stay alive during this period of time,
[03:24:24.489 --> 03:24:26.739]  and then of course going into the White House.
[03:24:27.059 --> 03:24:31.860]  So Trump is going to have to really take a hard look at his own personal security.
[03:24:32.020 --> 03:24:34.559]  I think his family needs to take a hard look at their security.
[03:24:35.219 --> 03:24:41.659]  Now, the types of enemies that we are facing, some are overseas, some are internal, some may be even working together.
[03:24:42.500 --> 03:24:49.219]  Some of this is just speculation on my part, but we already know that there was two attempts on this man's life in the last six months.
[03:24:49.459 --> 03:24:53.379]  So this is not speculation without experience, right?
[03:24:53.639 --> 03:24:57.360]  So that's one aspect of something that I do firmly believe.
[03:24:58.660 --> 03:25:11.520]  That Trump must be prepared for and must continue to push his people that he has around him, not just the staff, but the security structure and the security forces that he has around him.
[03:25:11.579 --> 03:25:13.700]  It's really, really imperative that he does that.
[03:25:13.950 --> 03:25:21.569]  And General, just to interrupt briefly, because I know he listens to you, and he got behind the bulletproof glass.
[03:25:21.569 --> 03:25:23.850]  He did get into more indoor areas.
[03:25:23.969 --> 03:25:28.469]  Now that we've won, and I understand he had to press the attack and roll the dice like he did.
[03:25:28.489 --> 03:25:29.190]  He has a lot of courage.
[03:25:29.370 --> 03:25:37.430]  I think he needs to now go into more of a bunker mentality, do a lot of digital media, a lot of press conferences, things like that, where he's protected.
[03:25:38.030 --> 03:25:39.430]  And then...
[03:25:41.390 --> 03:25:46.989]  We're good to go.
[03:25:58.389 --> 03:26:01.290]  And that's obviously the next move from the globalists.
[03:26:01.389 --> 03:26:02.850]  It's a no-brainer, show-show.
[03:26:03.350 --> 03:26:13.629]  Poisoning, service-to-air missiles, smuggling a bomb that looks like a battery, replacing it on some staffer's phone while they're in their hotel room.
[03:26:13.909 --> 03:26:16.610]  I mean, we could walk through all of that.
[03:26:17.110 --> 03:26:18.709]  What would your advice be to the president?
[03:26:18.850 --> 03:26:19.709]  Because this will get to it.
[03:26:19.790 --> 03:26:22.250]  In fact, give the president a few minutes and then get back to your points.
[03:26:23.010 --> 03:26:29.590]  Yeah, so I think one of the things he has to do, I don't want, I would never advise a bunker mentality.
[03:26:30.510 --> 03:26:42.270]  I think what he has to do is he's going to have to continue to expose himself to the, not just to the American people, but to the world, because he's got to show strength, and he's got to continue to show strength.
[03:26:42.409 --> 03:26:50.040]  But it's got to be done very smartly, and it's got to be done in ways that, you It's like a commander who maneuvers on the battlefield.
[03:26:50.219 --> 03:26:52.620]  He's always exposing himself to some level of risk.
[03:26:53.360 --> 03:26:57.860]  You're never going to get completely away from that, but it's got to be done in a much different way.
[03:26:58.020 --> 03:27:08.940]  But my bigger advice is to really start to hone in on and let the American people know the actions that you are planning to take on day one.
[03:27:09.450 --> 03:27:10.530]  I'm not talking about...
[03:27:10.530 --> 03:27:12.909]  I don't want to know what your 100-day plan is.
[03:27:13.069 --> 03:27:13.149]  Okay.
[03:27:13.989 --> 03:27:18.569]  Some staff, some transition staff will give us a 100-day plan of all the things they want to accomplish.
[03:27:19.010 --> 03:27:23.690]  I mean, we're not going to have that much time going forward.
[03:27:23.829 --> 03:27:27.549]  So four years, it's really three because you go into another election cycle, all this stuff.
[03:27:27.790 --> 03:27:29.309]  So I want to know...
[03:27:29.879 --> 03:27:34.540]  And what I would advise is to tell the American people, here's what I plan on doing on day one.
[03:27:34.620 --> 03:27:40.239]  And I know one of those things that he's planning on doing on day one is immediately starting in on this deportation plan.
[03:27:40.899 --> 03:27:46.299]  I think that's first and foremost because that's a promise that he made and a promise that I know he'll keep.
[03:27:46.880 --> 03:28:00.799]  There's also some efforts, and this is where some of the advisors around him, like Elon, who will get in there, and I know Elon's going to be looking at a task force of sort of government efficiency, and everybody's saying, well, he's got to get rid of 80% of the government.
[03:28:00.940 --> 03:28:07.219]  I actually think that there's 100% of some of the aspects of the government need to be eliminated.
[03:28:07.639 --> 03:28:19.729]  So I want Donald Trump to be Focused and to start to talk to the American people about some expectations that they can see and they will feel on day one.
[03:28:19.909 --> 03:28:20.469]  Day one.
[03:28:20.649 --> 03:28:37.940]  And then all of those have to have some structure of a team behind them to continue to push that effort, whether it's to shut down the Department of Education, whether it's to completely revamp the Department of Justice, whether it's to do things like Start looking at,
[03:28:38.319 --> 03:28:48.920]  you know, I want, for me, you know, advising him, I want a list of all commutations, all pardons, all dismissals that I want from things like the J6, right?
[03:28:49.059 --> 03:28:51.979]  I mean, because what we have learned about J6 as an example.
[03:28:52.079 --> 03:29:01.399]  So those are, that's an example of things that I want, and those are things that I will, you know, execute, or I would advise him to execute on day one.
[03:29:01.559 --> 03:29:07.920]  So all of a sudden, people begin to realize, okay, He is absolutely for real.
[03:29:08.040 --> 03:29:09.299]  He means what he says.
[03:29:09.459 --> 03:29:19.819]  And what this begins to do to the people that are still opposing him, and they will be opposing him when he gets into government, and these are people in government right now.
[03:29:20.420 --> 03:29:27.299]  People I don't think realize, but the Washington, D.C. voting tabulation, I think it was 95 or 97 percent, went for Harris.
[03:29:27.700 --> 03:29:31.559]  So that tells you everything you need to know about the opposing forces.
[03:29:31.700 --> 03:29:32.840]  So day one.
[03:29:32.979 --> 03:29:45.780]  And then I think Trump needs to, you know, come back to the American people and fairly soon and say, look, In the first 90 days, these are the top three priorities that I am going to achieve.
[03:29:45.940 --> 03:29:47.840]  And I mean, these are major, major tasks.
[03:29:48.840 --> 03:29:52.799]  Number one, it should always be the safety and security of the American people.
[03:29:52.899 --> 03:29:54.280]  That's making America first.
[03:29:54.459 --> 03:30:00.120]  So what are the subtasks to keeping the safety and security of the American people?
[03:30:00.659 --> 03:30:02.500]  Getting out of these damn wars overseas.
[03:30:03.350 --> 03:30:11.530]  Taking any money that's supposed to be going overseas and stopping that nonsense and flowing it back into places that matter in this country.
[03:30:12.250 --> 03:30:14.610]  So that would be a big priority.
[03:30:14.750 --> 03:30:22.170]  A second priority is the continuation of this deportation campaign, because this is going to be a campaign, and it's not going to be able to just happen on day one.
[03:30:22.309 --> 03:30:24.909]  But day one, we begin, and then updates.
[03:30:25.069 --> 03:30:26.069]  Here's how we're going to do it.
[03:30:26.129 --> 03:30:28.629]  Here's the task force I'm putting together for that.
[03:30:29.030 --> 03:30:43.909]  The third thing that I think, and these are all kind of top priorities, and this gets to what I've been engaged with in some conversations with Bobby Kennedy and watching what Bobby Kennedy is talking about in some of his interviews, is this making America healthy again, right?
[03:30:44.090 --> 03:30:45.610]  This is a big, big deal.
[03:30:45.829 --> 03:30:54.110]  We've got to rip the pharmaceutical lobby, and probably pro, but lobby out of the, like a cancer, just...
[03:30:54.530 --> 03:31:02.829]  We've got to rip it out of the body of America and get control of the health system in this country.
[03:31:03.069 --> 03:31:05.129]  And I mean, like, right away.
[03:31:05.329 --> 03:31:12.260]  So this is where, you know, Bobby Kennedy, and I know he'll start right now and he'll Bring together the right minds.
[03:31:12.420 --> 03:31:23.280]  And they'll start looking at, you know, CDC, FDA, Health and Human Services, and all the other components of our health system and start to say, okay, we're going to eliminate these things.
[03:31:23.420 --> 03:31:31.319]  We are going to get rid of these impositions of, let's just say, vaccines that go back to, I think, I think it's like 1987 or something.
[03:31:31.440 --> 03:31:34.180]  There's some rules that go back then.
[03:31:34.820 --> 03:31:53.180]  Another area that needs to be looked at, and I mean right now, starting day one, and I know that there are some people looking at these, but every single regulation, Trump mentioned it last night, and he's mentioned it a couple of times, and I think this is a real big issue for our economic health in this country,
[03:31:53.239 --> 03:31:54.000]  and that's Energy.
[03:31:54.280 --> 03:31:59.219]  And I'm a big proponent of all kinds of, all types of energy resources in this country.
[03:31:59.340 --> 03:32:17.780]  And I've told people that we have enough energy in the geology of the United States of America, and particularly in the contiguous 48 states that we have, as well as the waters around us, we have enough energy capability and resources to take care of the rest of the world for the next 500 years,
[03:32:18.040 --> 03:32:18.479]  minimum.
[03:32:18.979 --> 03:32:33.219]  So that energy resource, you know, And the capabilities that we have, there are so many regulations where people in places in this country can't even stick a shovel in the ground without going back and getting a federal mother mayot.
[03:32:33.659 --> 03:32:34.500]  It's insane.
[03:32:34.739 --> 03:32:41.819]  So the elimination of regulations, and he ought to be telling the American people, here are the things that I'm going to eliminate.
[03:32:42.000 --> 03:32:48.600]  So the moment, the second that I become president of the United States, all these regulations are going to be done.
[03:32:48.739 --> 03:32:49.420]  They're going to be gone.
[03:32:49.579 --> 03:33:12.549]  So You people down at the local level, you people down at the state level, you can start to re-energize the kinds of business processes, the type of businesses that we can create in this country immediately because energy is a commodity that the United States has in abundance and that can bring wealth to so many other components,
[03:33:12.750 --> 03:33:16.250]  manufacturing, You know, just the whole innovation...
[03:33:16.250 --> 03:33:20.430]  I mean, just to be clear, the globalists admit they're cutting off the energy to make us poor to control us.
[03:33:20.530 --> 03:33:21.090]  It's clouded and pivotal.
[03:33:21.290 --> 03:33:21.610]  Absolutely.
[03:33:21.969 --> 03:33:25.010]  So we just get out of the UN treaties and just going back for a moment...
[03:33:26.100 --> 03:33:32.639]  Trump has talked about the 325,000 kids so far in the Senate report a few months ago that were brought in that Kamala didn't lose.
[03:33:32.799 --> 03:33:33.520]  They got rid of them on purpose.
[03:33:33.780 --> 03:33:47.799]  We've had the whistleblowers on that testified to Congress in the studio where they were being given three-month-old babies on planes with no diapers or formula, and then just giving them to people, in some cases with no paperwork, found in slave labor, found in sex slavery.
[03:33:48.100 --> 03:33:50.659]  Not just say, we're going to stop that.
[03:33:50.680 --> 03:33:52.299]  He needs to go after the NGOs.
[03:33:52.299 --> 03:33:53.840]  He needs to go after Mayorkas.
[03:33:58.290 --> 03:34:01.090]  I think?
[03:34:16.250 --> 03:34:19.930]  That did this and ended the DNA testing to see if a kid was really with their family.
[03:34:20.149 --> 03:34:23.010]  I mean, this is the smoking gun, General Flynn, as you know.
[03:34:23.170 --> 03:34:27.290]  And that's the way to first attack the Democratic Party.
[03:34:27.569 --> 03:34:33.489]  With that, bring down Mayorkas, I mean criminal charges, after they go into this.
[03:34:33.930 --> 03:34:49.149]  Get control of the Justice Department, fire all the U.S. attorneys, put his people in, and then directly, not target some little scandal here or there, go right into the human trafficking and the UN NGOs and these charities, instantly smoking gun info.
[03:34:49.290 --> 03:34:50.270]  We already have all the witnesses.
[03:34:50.909 --> 03:34:54.729]  And then that brings down the Democrats as the human smuggling pedophile party.
[03:34:54.850 --> 03:34:55.930]  That is my proposal.
[03:34:55.989 --> 03:34:56.590]  What do you think about that?
[03:34:57.170 --> 03:34:59.270]  Yeah, so you're exactly right.
[03:34:59.450 --> 03:35:08.709]  So when we say the deportation campaign, the deportation campaign should have a series of phases and subtasks, right?
[03:35:08.950 --> 03:35:19.049]  And I mean, not to overcomplicate this thing, but this idea about going after what you just described, which is, I think it's 350 or 400,000 missing children, right?
[03:35:19.149 --> 03:35:19.870]  Quote, unquote, missing.
[03:35:19.989 --> 03:35:21.409]  They know what happened to them.
[03:35:21.489 --> 03:35:23.049]  They put them into slave labor.
[03:35:23.190 --> 03:35:31.329]  We're talking about two Three, four-year-old children, babies, right up to teenagers, but babies that are out there being sex-slaved.
[03:35:31.469 --> 03:35:32.530]  This is sickening.
[03:35:32.629 --> 03:35:41.670]  And so this has got to be like sort of a first priority within this campaign because that's part of what we as Americans should do.
[03:35:41.709 --> 03:35:46.270]  If we want to say we maintain the moral high ground, We should immediately go after this.
[03:35:46.670 --> 03:36:03.649]  You know, a component of all this is, of course, to go after these criminals that we know came in with the illegal invasion, the terrorists that we know that came in that are on the books right now of the FBI and the CIA and all these other agencies and clearly under DHS. These people know this.
[03:36:03.770 --> 03:36:10.170]  And we have people inside the government right now, some of whom are whistleblowers who are ready to go to work for us.
[03:36:10.190 --> 03:36:14.610]  And there's others that I know that are in the government that have been crushed.
[03:36:14.709 --> 03:36:17.590]  When they have risen their heads to talk about this kind of stuff.
[03:36:18.030 --> 03:36:20.129]  And General, let's go back because this is the key to everything in my view.
[03:36:20.170 --> 03:36:20.809]  You just said it.
[03:36:20.809 --> 03:36:21.309]  You're the expert.
[03:36:21.409 --> 03:36:22.110]  I know you know more than I do.
[03:36:22.170 --> 03:36:24.690]  I just want you to elaborate so we can get this done.
[03:36:25.250 --> 03:36:32.190]  As you said, go after the serious criminal gangs so the public sees it's the right thing to do and that Trump's protecting them.
[03:36:32.329 --> 03:36:34.850]  It legitimizes everything else he's doing that's the right thing to do.
[03:36:35.030 --> 03:36:36.370]  Go after the criminal gangs.
[03:36:37.290 --> 03:36:38.729]  Go after the terrorists.
[03:36:38.930 --> 03:36:43.709]  And that's the war right there that's That's real and unifying and right.
[03:36:43.950 --> 03:36:45.290]  People totally get behind him.
[03:36:45.389 --> 03:36:56.590]  Then the human trafficking at the same time, which goes right to the Democrats and the NGOs, and then that is the domino that's the right thing to do as well that brings them all down.
[03:36:56.889 --> 03:37:02.750]  And so, I mean, to me, this is the thing to hit and also stopping World War III. Please continue.
[03:37:03.379 --> 03:37:15.139]  Yeah, and because you've hit on NGOs a couple of times, and I think people need to understand that the NGOs, there's a lot of churches, a lot of faith-based organizations that are involved in this kind of stuff.
[03:37:15.280 --> 03:37:30.360]  So this has got to be one of these—and I don't use the word ruthless— But there's got to be a ruthlessness to the campaign that this undertakes, because some of these NGOs are directly involved,
[03:37:30.399 --> 03:37:31.639]  and we know exactly who they are.
[03:37:31.819 --> 03:37:37.180]  Some of these are faith-based organizations that hide behind that, and we know exactly who they are.
[03:37:37.440 --> 03:37:41.239]  And I will tell you, I keep a list right here.
[03:37:41.440 --> 03:37:43.520]  I'll show you this right here, okay?
[03:37:43.520 --> 03:37:49.340]  This is my enemy terrain, and many of them that are part of that.
[03:37:50.139 --> 03:37:53.840]  This is something that I have been focused on for a long, long time.
[03:37:53.959 --> 03:37:59.680]  You have a lot of different NGOs and the Arabella Advisors.
[03:38:00.940 --> 03:38:09.959]  I'm showing this on your show here because there is a scheme to the enemy terrain and to the enemy disposition on a battlefield.
[03:38:10.180 --> 03:38:13.440]  This is the disposition of our foes.
[03:38:13.620 --> 03:38:21.479]  And a lot of these Their ultimate goal is what I describe as global power and a weak America.
[03:38:21.719 --> 03:38:29.899]  Well, we just won a major victory last night, and that victory has to be sealed by us continuing to fight, like I say, through this objective.
[03:38:30.299 --> 03:38:49.540]  And on this map are a series of non-governmental organizations, a number of faith-based organizations that are directly, directly involved in the illegal invasion that this country has been experiencing, even going back to Obama, but clearly during the last three and a half years under the Biden-Harris administration.
[03:38:49.819 --> 03:38:51.760]  And I'm telling you, these exist.
[03:38:52.049 --> 03:38:53.010]  We know where they are.
[03:38:53.110 --> 03:38:54.790]  We know exactly how they operate.
[03:38:55.010 --> 03:38:59.409]  And we need to go after every single one of these and dismantle this formation.
[03:38:59.409 --> 03:39:01.190]  We have to dismantle a lot of this.
[03:39:01.629 --> 03:39:03.709]  And then they organize the illegals to vote.
[03:39:04.270 --> 03:39:05.809]  I mean, it's all in that.
[03:39:05.989 --> 03:39:07.670]  And that's the UN plan they said 50 years ago.
[03:39:07.729 --> 03:39:08.610]  We'll use NGOs.
[03:39:09.149 --> 03:39:12.590]  We'll do reverse colonization with the third world and conquer the first world.
[03:39:12.729 --> 03:39:14.170]  This is replacement migration, General.
[03:39:14.959 --> 03:39:15.219]  Yeah.
[03:39:15.399 --> 03:39:17.139]  And who funds a lot of this?
[03:39:17.280 --> 03:39:19.719]  I mentioned the Arabella Advisors.
[03:39:19.920 --> 03:39:23.319]  I mean, this is a George Soros construction, okay?
[03:39:23.600 --> 03:39:28.799]  A construction type of organization.
[03:39:29.100 --> 03:39:30.959]  And what they've done is they've created...
[03:39:31.620 --> 03:39:51.979]  They've created for-profit organizations, and then under them, they have these non-profit organizations, and then they have these non-governmental organizations that tie directly into the U.S. government and get grants, I mean, to the tune of millions and millions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to be able to go and do these kinds of tasks that we're talking about right now.
[03:39:54.219 --> 03:39:55.420]  Yeah, yeah, they do.
[03:39:55.620 --> 03:40:01.739]  And some of them work directly for elements of the U.S. government, namely Department of Homeland Security.
[03:40:01.940 --> 03:40:08.600]  Some of them work for or underneath the USAID. So these are things that I know.
[03:40:08.680 --> 03:40:13.020]  These are things that there are others like me that I know we can depend on.
[03:40:13.550 --> 03:40:21.069]  That we can go in there and systematically and structurally, because this is not just about building a wall and closing the border.
[03:40:21.229 --> 03:40:23.690]  We have this all over the country right now.
[03:40:23.850 --> 03:40:31.110]  And a lot of these NGOs, they not only operate at Eagles Pass, Texas, but they also operate Operate in St.
[03:40:31.209 --> 03:40:36.309]  Louis, Missouri, or they operate in Chicago, Illinois, or they operate in Boston, Massachusetts.
[03:40:36.670 --> 03:40:45.149]  These NGOs are spread and sprinkled all over the map to be able to function as sort of enemy forces, if you will, on the battlefield of America.
[03:40:45.350 --> 03:40:53.110]  And what they're doing is they're ripping us off and they're destroying the lives of, in many cases, children.
[03:40:53.629 --> 03:41:01.750]  Because when we're talking about, initially, A year and a half ago, I think it was 90,000 was the number that was reported to Congress that were missing children.
[03:41:01.989 --> 03:41:12.930]  And then all of a sudden, like six months, eight months later, that number jumped up to 350,000 when people inside, who we know, they came out and they said, this is a lie.
[03:41:13.149 --> 03:41:14.229]  Our government's lying.
[03:41:14.670 --> 03:41:15.549]  DHS is lying.
[03:41:15.690 --> 03:41:16.549]  Mayorkas is lying.
[03:41:16.729 --> 03:41:18.709]  It's not 90,000, which is bad enough.
[03:41:18.870 --> 03:41:19.530]  One is terrible.
[03:41:20.079 --> 03:41:22.260]  But it's more like 350,000.
[03:41:22.520 --> 03:41:25.000]  So this is a big issue.
[03:41:25.139 --> 03:41:27.159]  Once we start to tackle this, and this is...
[03:41:27.159 --> 03:41:36.280]  So I think that not the entire battle plan that will be developed needs to be exposed to everybody because we don't want...
[03:41:36.280 --> 03:41:39.899]  We've got to keep some of these people off...
[03:41:39.899 --> 03:41:42.120]  We've got to keep them on their heels a bit.
[03:41:42.280 --> 03:41:47.760]  But we've got to start talking to the American people about the types of things that we're going to need the American people's help with.
[03:41:48.229 --> 03:41:49.489]  Oh, it's the right thing to do.
[03:41:49.670 --> 03:41:53.530]  It'll unify everybody and it will bring them down and they're involved at the top.
[03:41:53.649 --> 03:41:55.450]  It's the UN's always being caught in human trafficking.
[03:41:55.829 --> 03:41:57.069]  We can bring them all down with this.
[03:41:57.229 --> 03:42:01.750]  General Flynn, how do people find your incredible work, your books, your material, everything you do?
[03:42:02.590 --> 03:42:09.229]  Yeah, they can go to FlynnMovie.com, FlynnMovie.com, and rent the movie, or get the movie.
[03:42:09.370 --> 03:42:09.930]  It's $3.99.
[03:42:10.430 --> 03:42:16.270]  The other thing is, on GeneralFlynn.com, I put out a newsletter a couple of times a week, actually.
[03:42:16.270 --> 03:42:20.110]  I love to write and get my thoughts out there on stuff like we're talking about right now.
[03:42:20.489 --> 03:42:21.510]  GeneralFlynn.com.
[03:42:21.670 --> 03:42:27.049]  And also on X, follow me at Jen Flynn, and I'll put my thoughts out there on a daily basis.
[03:42:27.430 --> 03:42:30.889]  And I really, really appreciate you, Alex, and everything that you've done for this country.
[03:42:31.049 --> 03:42:31.270]  I appreciate it.
[03:42:31.290 --> 03:42:31.829]  Appreciate you.
[03:42:32.030 --> 03:42:32.629]  It's history.
[03:42:32.629 --> 03:42:33.270]  It's happening.
[03:42:33.409 --> 03:42:34.229]  We have the beachhead.
[03:42:34.329 --> 03:42:35.389]  Now we've got to press the attack.
[03:42:35.569 --> 03:42:37.049]  God bless you, sir, and Godspeed.
[03:42:37.209 --> 03:42:38.290]  Thank you for your gracious time.
[03:42:39.350 --> 03:42:39.909]  Thank you.
[03:42:40.409 --> 03:42:40.729]  All right.
[03:42:40.809 --> 03:42:41.909]  Owen Troyer takes over.
[03:42:41.989 --> 03:42:43.190]  I'll be doing special broadcasts.
[03:42:43.250 --> 03:42:43.989]  Follow InfoWars.
[03:42:44.110 --> 03:42:45.229]  Follow me at ReloxJonesOnX.
[03:42:45.469 --> 03:42:46.530]  We're going to win the war.
[03:42:46.690 --> 03:42:49.190]  God bless you all, and God bless President Trump.
[03:42:49.590 --> 03:42:55.190]  What I'm about to break down can benefit you in multiple ways, three different ways.
[03:42:56.840 --> 03:43:11.860]  Number one, it will keep this transmission against the globalists that they absolutely hate on the air and will keep a broadcast and news information system that is credited by the most evil people on earth as being one of the main thorns in their side.
[03:43:12.079 --> 03:43:18.000]  So you keep us out there fighting for you, fighting for ourselves, fighting for our future when you get this product.
[03:43:18.219 --> 03:43:20.219]  Now here's the other two big benefits.
[03:43:21.389 --> 03:43:32.950]  Everybody knows that CBD from the hemp plant is absolutely incredible, anti-inflammatory, great for mental clarity and focus, but also being relaxed at the same time.
[03:43:33.309 --> 03:43:36.709]  Just so good for your immune system, all your cells, your whole body.
[03:43:36.850 --> 03:43:38.129]  It is a gift from God.
[03:43:38.329 --> 03:43:39.750]  So everybody knows that.
[03:43:40.010 --> 03:43:41.889]  Hell, medical doctors are prescribing it everywhere.
[03:43:43.010 --> 03:43:46.549]  But then here's the other part, and this is the part you may not know.
[03:43:48.139 --> 03:43:59.440]  When you see the high-end 1,000-milligram CBDs out there, and they're retailing at 120 or 140 or 150 from your doctor, these are the discounted brands for $75.
[03:44:00.079 --> 03:44:02.379]  That's about the market rate.
[03:44:03.379 --> 03:44:05.879]  That's a good deal compared to 120 or 150.
[03:44:06.459 --> 03:44:09.739]  But, ladies and gentlemen, there's a ton of markup in there.
[03:44:10.139 --> 03:44:19.260]  One of the top manufacturers in the country that has scores of companies private labeling their highly rated product is owned by a listener.
[03:44:19.860 --> 03:44:30.440]  And so I've been talking to them really for over a year, but in the last six months we got serious with one of my sponsors for them to go and private label them from them and for us to be authorized.
[03:44:31.399 --> 03:44:42.579]  To bring you the lowest price you're going to find anywhere on high-quality CBD. So I want to introduce to you JonesCBD.com.
[03:44:44.079 --> 03:44:45.379]  JonesCBD.com.
[03:44:45.600 --> 03:44:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this 1,000-milligram concentrated nano-tincture, which means it's way more highly absorbable, Could easily retail for $120 and sell all day.
[03:44:59.100 --> 03:45:00.719]  And some people will pay more because they think it's better.
[03:45:00.940 --> 03:45:01.280]  No.
[03:45:01.639 --> 03:45:09.100]  This same CBD is sold by different people that probably label it from $140, $120, $75.
[03:45:09.860 --> 03:45:12.819]  Nobody, even when they discount it, is going below that.
[03:45:13.399 --> 03:45:15.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing Ultra Green.
[03:45:16.239 --> 03:45:23.180]  This is a 1,000-milligram, high-end, nano-process, so it goes into the cells.
[03:45:23.420 --> 03:45:25.079]  Much better at the statistics here.
[03:45:25.100 --> 03:45:25.819]  It's on the website.
[03:45:26.059 --> 03:45:28.639]  And this is all documented, all certified.
[03:45:29.260 --> 03:45:35.500]  This is the best steel you're going to find anywhere, and it's only $47.95.
[03:45:35.719 --> 03:45:39.010]  And when you combo it, It's even less.
[03:45:39.129 --> 03:45:41.489]  So let me read some of the facts off here.
[03:45:42.149 --> 03:45:48.690]  It's nano-sized bioaventability, supercharged, delivering eight to nine times the absorption of standard formulas.
[03:45:49.010 --> 03:45:54.409]  If you're done with watered-down, underpowered products, UltraGreen is here to bring you the real deal.
[03:45:54.909 --> 03:45:55.829]  Demand the best.
[03:45:56.069 --> 03:46:00.909]  Grab Ultra Green Nano CBD at jonescbd.com today.
[03:46:01.270 --> 03:46:05.409]  And then there's another great product that's even less, $39.95.
[03:46:05.409 --> 03:46:12.889]  And it's got the Nano CBD in it and then a whole bunch of other known concentrated herbs that give you deep, restful sleep.
[03:46:12.889 --> 03:46:16.309]  And the CBD does that as well.
[03:46:16.549 --> 03:46:19.729]  So I don't have to sell you on CBD. I don't have to sell you on supporting the broadcast.
[03:46:20.110 --> 03:46:22.850]  All I'm asking you to do is to try this.
[03:46:23.719 --> 03:46:24.799]  And what do you have to lose?
[03:46:24.920 --> 03:46:25.920]  You've funded the broadcast.
[03:46:25.920 --> 03:46:26.719]  You're fighting tyranny.
[03:46:26.840 --> 03:46:38.340]  And when you get a great response from this CBD and you take it and it works better than CBD that costs twice as much or more, you're going to say, Alex Jones did not steer me wrong again.
[03:46:38.620 --> 03:46:43.319]  I didn't bring a silver or gold sponsor on until about 13 months ago.
[03:46:43.620 --> 03:46:45.540]  I've been in silver and gold for 30 years.
[03:46:45.780 --> 03:46:49.559]  For 12, I haven't promoted it because the silver and gold market was down.
[03:46:50.979 --> 03:46:52.760]  And most of the dealers were overcharging.
[03:46:52.899 --> 03:46:54.959]  So I didn't promote silver or gold for 12 years.
[03:46:55.360 --> 03:47:09.569]  When I knew it was going to explode, and I was sure of it, with all the indicators, because I read the economists' work across the board every day, I got a sponsor that's highly rated on, and Silver, since he came on, is up almost 50%.
[03:47:09.569 --> 03:47:11.010]  Gold's exploded as well.
[03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:13.989]  So, I don't steer you wrong.
[03:47:14.409 --> 03:47:24.229]  And when I tell you that if you already like CBD, and most folks do and know how great it works, this is high-end, high-quality, at the lowest price you're going to find.
[03:47:24.229 --> 03:47:27.969]  This is just some of the products that are at JonesCBD.com.
[03:47:28.190 --> 03:47:43.899]  We are very excited about this, and it is helping fund The Alex Jones Network at AJN Live on X and the studios, the satellite uplinks for radio and TV, the crew, the legal, everything we're doing.
[03:47:44.100 --> 03:47:45.459]  So it is a match made in heaven.
[03:47:46.399 --> 03:47:58.879]  All you've got to do is go to jonescbd.com, buy the product, you support the broadcast, you win right there, you get it, and you take it, and you get a great experience.
[03:47:58.879 --> 03:47:59.899]  It works great.
[03:48:00.079 --> 03:48:01.399]  Believe me, I use it all the time.
[03:48:01.559 --> 03:48:02.760]  My family uses it.
[03:48:03.379 --> 03:48:06.159]  And Then I want you to do something else.
[03:48:06.299 --> 03:48:09.040]  If you've not known how good CBD was, you're going to go, this is great.
[03:48:09.159 --> 03:48:10.000]  You're into CBD now.
[03:48:11.340 --> 03:48:17.040]  Go out and get one of the other brands that's even more money and then just see if this doesn't work better or just as good.
[03:48:17.280 --> 03:48:18.739]  Because this is high-end.
[03:48:19.280 --> 03:48:24.819]  The same company we're getting this from, people sell it for twice as much or more all day long.
[03:48:25.040 --> 03:48:29.780]  Now again, if you are a CBD person, you'll know immediately when you take it that is high quality.
[03:48:30.000 --> 03:48:34.180]  Now can you pay three times as much and get 3,000 milligram and even more concentrate?
[03:48:34.479 --> 03:48:36.399]  Yeah, but it becomes overkill.
[03:48:36.559 --> 03:48:40.399]  So instead of taking, you know, Four or five drops of the super strong stuff.
[03:48:40.579 --> 03:48:43.959]  You take six, seven, eight drops of this, and it's just as good.
[03:48:44.059 --> 03:48:44.739]  You got a lower price.
[03:48:45.100 --> 03:48:48.379]  And again, 1,000 milligram is very high on the spectrum.
[03:48:48.540 --> 03:48:49.299]  It's already very strong.
[03:48:49.399 --> 03:48:51.760]  But to be honest, there's stuff even stronger out there.
[03:48:51.840 --> 03:48:52.600]  But this is high quality.
[03:48:52.879 --> 03:48:53.579]  It's nano.
[03:48:53.860 --> 03:48:55.020]  It funds the operation.
[03:48:55.360 --> 03:48:59.940]  This is, hands down, the best deal there is out there.
[03:49:00.399 --> 03:49:06.520]  So please visit jonescbd.com today and keep this transmission on one way or another.
[03:49:06.700 --> 03:49:08.100]  I humbly thank you.
[03:49:08.239 --> 03:49:16.840]  I respectfully thank you for what you've done because I can't do this without you and we are funding our operations against the globalists of retail sales.
[03:49:17.530 --> 03:49:24.690]  And as you know, it's been all over the newspapers, have spent close to $80 million of lawsuits and garbage trying to shut us down the last seven years.
[03:49:24.889 --> 03:49:29.049]  And because of your support, we have been able to fight them off and stay on air.
[03:49:29.170 --> 03:49:35.930]  But now is our most critical time to ensure that this new system is able to stay on air, regardless of what happens to Infowars.
[03:49:36.069 --> 03:49:37.889]  So this is a time for action.
[03:49:38.250 --> 03:49:39.809]  And you don't just vote for Trump.
[03:49:40.459 --> 03:49:44.819]  You also support the independent organizations that are exposing the globalists.
[03:49:44.979 --> 03:49:50.200]  That's why they're obsessed with censorship because with the truth getting out there, their lies cannot stand.
[03:49:50.399 --> 03:49:59.680]  So get a great deal, empower your body, reduce inflammation, have a better immune system, enjoy all the great benefits of CBD and more.
[03:50:00.020 --> 03:50:04.639]  Get a great deal and keep us on air all at jonescbd.com.
[03:50:04.760 --> 03:50:05.559]  Thank you so much.
