[00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.950]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.669]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the Infowars.
[00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:30.920]  It's Friday, November 22nd, 2024. Trump is now meeting in Mar-a-Lago in a secret global peace summit with the head of NATO. InfoWars.
[00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.640]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:47.960]  58 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, 17 seconds till the inauguration of the 47th President of the United States, Donald John Trump.
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:59.359]  It is Friday, November 22nd, 2024. I am your embattled host, Alex Jones, coming to you from Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide.
[00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:00.840]  All right.
[00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.009]  Massive news.
[00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.510]  I don't know why the corporate media is unable to ever break anything.
[00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.049]  This stuff is easy to figure out.
[00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:13.329]  But I guess they're not dialed into the Trump administration or don't even know how to follow geopolitics.
[00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.510]  I told you yesterday in a global exclusive...
[00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:26.930]  That Trump has been holding, really for the last two weeks, a secret global peace summit off and on at Mar-a-Lago with Putin, Zelensky, other world leaders.
[00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:41.530]  And I told you yesterday that we could hear some major announcements within the next 48 hours and that Trump was in direct communication with NATO. That was all covered in the first 15 minutes of yesterday's show.
[00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:42.049]  You missed it.
[00:01:43.189 --> 00:02:02.370]  Now it is breaking today that the Secretary General of NATO is in Florida, and my sources tell me that he is reportedly already at Mar-a-Lago, and that there are other leaders that are going to be arriving there as we speak.
[00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.109]  So this is a big deal.
[00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:13.229]  I've been saying since Tuesday when England and the United States, first the U.S., then England, started bombing inside Russia.
[00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:26.949]  This was an insane escalation and that it would soon be called the beginning of World War III. Now we've got all these different world leaders and military leaders saying World War III began when the West began to bomb Russia.
[00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.270]  And that is Western leaders that are saying that.
[00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.849]  The Russians said if the missiles were used, they would be at war with us.
[00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.270]  But that was a month ago.
[00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.789]  They've not made that statement officially yet.
[00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.110]  But we broke that two days ago.
[00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.650]  I said World War III has already begun, that within 48 hours they would start announcing it.
[00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.710]  Now they have, within 36 hours last night.
[00:02:48.050 --> 00:03:06.110]  I also said Putin would, in the next few days, yesterday, or two days ago at the start of the show, that Putin would test an ICBM And prove that it could evade anti-missile defense systems,
[00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:07.409]  which he then did yesterday.
[00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:20.150]  I then said he would make an announcement in the next 48 hours that it was a successful test of evading defenses and that the missile could easily be loaded with hydrogen bombs instead of conventional weapons.
[00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.449]  I didn't know that 15 minutes after I said that, he would go live to the world saying exactly what I said.
[00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:32.409]  This isn't about me saying, look how smart I am when you actually study doctrine and governments and systems and follow it.
[00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:37.620]  18 hours a day like I do, you know what's coming next almost every time.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.800]  And I point out the credibility of my analysis that is the best out there in the public.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.180]  It's not like the Pentagon doesn't know the stuff either at the top when they're paying attention, unlike Lloyd Austin and others that are literally asleep at the switch.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:04:02.099]  It's to point out that when I tell you that we're the closest to nuclear war we've ever been in like two seconds to midnight on the doomsday clock, that's where we are.
[00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.289]  So, this is extremely dangerous.
[00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.409]  People have a normalcy bias that life's going to go on.
[00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:18.269]  But it's not just individuals that can go to work and die in a car wreck or get struck by lightning or die in a fire or in a gas explosion.
[00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.509]  It's society's camp.
[00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.709]  And now we've got all these Atlantean weapons.
[00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.110]  Whether Atlantis existed or not, supposedly some energy system they had blew up their island.
[00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.509]  Well, whether that's a fable or not, we're now in the position of where the fabled Atlantis was.
[00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.050]  We're still just regular people, but we've got godlike powers.
[00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.889]  And the question is, will we all blow each other up?
[00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.089]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.790]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:43.410]  Stay with me.
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.480]  We are unified by our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.259]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of information.
[00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:04.170]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:07.410]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:10.009]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.029]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.730]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:24.089]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the new world order and BlackRock.
[00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.709]  They've declared war on us and we accept the challenge.
[00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:36.540]  We're taking the AlexJones.network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.680]  Infowars can be shut down in just a few weeks.
[00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:47.379]  But regardless, the fight continues at AJNLive on X, the Alex Jones Network.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.279]  If the globalists think they're going to shut us down, we've got another thing coming.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.740]  The Second American Revolution continues on at AJNLive.
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.180]  Follow me there now for news updates and critical intel as we restore our republic.
[00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:17.850]  I wanted to air that public announcement from three weeks ago that we just aired here on this live Friday, November 22nd, 2024 transmission, because what is old is new in this paradox we live in.
[00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:25.329]  On May 31st, the Justice Department, without a court order, tried to close the door, sent private armed security to do it.
[00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.750]  I said, where's your warrant?
[00:06:26.829 --> 00:06:27.389]  Where's your court order?
[00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:28.689]  They said, you're right, we're not doing it.
[00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:29.750]  I said, you bet you're not.
[00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.970]  Then last week, the new federal trustee came in here, lied and said the place had been sold.
[00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:39.610]  I said, you're in a lot of trouble.
[00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:43.509]  They cut the internet so we couldn't broadcast from here.
[00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:50.189]  At the internet service provider level, I went to the Alex Jones Network, got back on air to tens of millions of viewers, over 100 million tuned in that day.
[00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:54.050]  The broadcast and the clips of the show, just on X alone.
[00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.290]  And I was back in the studio the next day.
[00:06:59.329 --> 00:07:01.050]  And I've been here now for over a week.
[00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:16.930]  And there's a court hearing on Monday, but that is a status conference just to tee up a full day trial or longer that the judge will set, I don't know when, probably after Thanksgiving, of the U.S. trustee and what he did.
[00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:33.509]  Now, this is emblematic of the wild-eyed corruption of In the deep state, in the government, and it's come out in court that orders came down when I went into bankruptcy two years ago to destroy me in the process and to find crimes.
[00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:36.009]  They did not, obviously.
[00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:45.769]  If I'm anything, when it comes to business and operations, I am like Ward Cleaver level.
[00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:48.920]  So, and that's just how I operate.
[00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:50.120]  I don't even do it on purpose.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.740]  That's how my family is.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.300]  But these people have been trying to throw me in prison, and I'm sick of it.
[00:07:56.439 --> 00:07:58.279]  And I have sued the hell out of them.
[00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:00.639]  The Justice Department trustee, all of them.
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:06.959]  But I can't operate without your support, and I'm in the most important fight of Infowars 30-plus year history.
[00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:09.620]  I've been calling the show and had the website since...
[00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:15.180]  1997, but I've been on air for 30 plus years.
[00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:19.000]  And in the history of our broadcast, we're reaching the most people.
[00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:20.439]  We're dominating.
[00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:26.879]  I'm way more informed and learned and experienced and seasoned and battle-hardened than I ever was.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:37.240]  I am 10 times more aware and sharp than I was when I was 20 years old, first getting on the air.
[00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:37.860]  And I was...
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:50.539]  I could hold my own with some of the top political talk show hosts in the world by the time I was 22. And I'm not bragging, I'm just saying I was informed and learned then more than most political pundits that are 70 years old on the national news today.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.220]  But now, I am the master.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.120]  And that doesn't mean I know everything.
[00:08:56.779 --> 00:08:58.460]  Aristotle said, I know that I know nothing.
[00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:00.340]  The fool thinks he knows everything.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:07.419]  But that said, compared to basically anybody else involved on the air in geopolitics, I am the master.
[00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:16.990]  This broadcast is the most informative, the most accurate, the most cutting edge, team humanity transmission in the world.
[00:09:18.169 --> 00:09:21.909]  And I say that because it's a fact, and we can't lose it.
[00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:29.970]  So I have to battle for Infowars, and if they're able to get that, which it looks like they won't, but it takes money to fight them, even if that happens, we go to the Alex Jones Network.
[00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.669]  And that means funds.
[00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:38.120]  So I need you to go to thealexjonesstore.com and get incredible Patriot gear, amazing supplements, and more.
[00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:38.799]  I'm going to stop there.
[00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:41.320]  But that is critical.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:46.940]  I want to thank those of you that have kept us on the air over the years, but now is the maximum time of our need.
[00:09:47.259 --> 00:09:49.480]  I need you to come to my aid, come to your own aid.
[00:09:49.559 --> 00:09:50.500]  We're fighting for you.
[00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:52.100]  I can't do it without you.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.259]  All of our success is because of you.
[00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:58.700]  If I didn't have you backing me in this war, we wouldn't have got any of this done.
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.600]  All the success and all the victory goes to you, temporarily.
[00:10:04.759 --> 00:10:07.220]  And that means on this planet, humans, you.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.440]  God, of course, is the author of it all.
[00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:12.200]  And our master and commander.
[00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:18.059]  Alright, that said, let me be very clear now.
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.179]  I do not come on air every day now.
[00:10:29.009 --> 00:10:37.509]  Multiple times an hour and tell you exactly what's about to happen days or hours before for no reason.
[00:10:38.490 --> 00:11:00.490]  I do it so that people can understand that I have an extreme grasp on the compendium of knowledge and information and the modus operandi of the different players and I know how the bad guys are going to strike back.
[00:11:02.309 --> 00:11:09.809]  And so I don't make all these predictions that come true so that people think, wow, that guy's smart.
[00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:21.470]  I do it so we can start making the predictions and have enough people listen to me in government, in the general public, in the corporations, in the...
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:31.679]  In the systems of human activity so that we can get ahead of things that the globalists are planning and stop them.
[00:11:33.919 --> 00:11:44.659]  And I said decades ago, I know when I lay out all this horrible stuff that's going to happen, some people will listen to the documents, look at the information, and will know it's true.
[00:11:47.690 --> 00:12:03.409]  But once they really launch the New World Order in 2020, which they said they would, they'd go from beta to operational, from Agenda 21 to Agenda 2030, it's going to get so hellish and so evil and so out in the open with the anti-family,
[00:12:03.549 --> 00:12:24.179]  pedophile, open border, world government, banning range stoves, banning fireplaces, banning family farms, attacking the family, transgenderism, that when this whole satanic agenda really goes into high gear, We would have already warned so many people that I knew instinctively that all those reports,
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:39.000]  those books, those films, those materials that had already been seen by billions of people translated into so many languages, if you thought it was powerful then, it wouldn't just be evergreen in the future.
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.220]  Meaning...
[00:12:48.909 --> 00:12:49.909]  Still pertinent.
[00:12:51.289 --> 00:12:54.370]  It would be ultra green.
[00:12:55.029 --> 00:12:58.090]  Meaning it gets better with time.
[00:12:58.269 --> 00:12:59.889]  Because you're not living in the prediction.
[00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.049]  You're living in its...
[00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:06.870]  Culmination.
[00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.289]  You're living in it coming true.
[00:13:09.549 --> 00:13:10.470]  It's fulfillment.
[00:13:11.309 --> 00:13:12.070]  So...
[00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:22.480]  I told you 48 hours ago that within 48 hours, major world leaders and military leaders would start announcing that World War III has begun.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:32.840]  I have stacks of articles and stacks of leaders saying it last night, 36 hours after I said it, at the start of the show, Wednesday.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:51.820]  I then went on air yesterday at the start of the broadcast saying, And I said, Trump is having a global secret peace summit via video link and teleconference with Putin,
[00:13:52.059 --> 00:13:57.379]  Zelensky, NATO, Keir Starmer, Macron, all of them.
[00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:06.340]  And I said within 48 hours they will announce that there's been an ongoing global peace summit since he was president-elect.
[00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:17.230]  On November 6th, in the middle of the night, and now it's becoming to come out in the news that indeed that's been happening, and that's good.
[00:14:17.429 --> 00:14:19.470]  So people have been, where is Trump?
[00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.370]  He has said nothing.
[00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:32.789]  That video we played that got 120 million views on Exelon, Tuesday, when the U.S. started bombing Russia with the Tacums, was him a year ago saying it's going to lead to World War III and it needs to stop.
[00:14:34.779 --> 00:14:36.440]  And people still wouldn't listen to me.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.019]  They went and found out for themselves it was old.
[00:14:39.799 --> 00:14:41.879]  Because folks wanted to hear from Trump, and I get it.
[00:14:42.139 --> 00:14:48.399]  And I said, Wednesday, I said, we better hear soon from Trump.
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.580]  But I knew he'd been working on peace deals.
[00:14:51.779 --> 00:15:00.799]  Then I made some calls and told you yesterday morning at the start of the show that indeed there is a secret global peace summit and that world leaders...
[00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.549]  We're on their way to Mar-a-Lago.
[00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.649]  Now that is confirmed this morning.
[00:15:12.409 --> 00:15:13.590]  So that's good.
[00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:22.889]  Trump is trying to stop World War III. So we'll go over that and then I'm going to tell you what I believe is going to happen next.
[00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:26.029]  And I want to be very clear on the current trajectory.
[00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:29.490]  We have a chance to affect this.
[00:15:30.789 --> 00:15:32.149]  But this is a big deal.
[00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:48.029]  Again, I tell you what's going on years, months, weeks, days, hours before exactly what I say happening so that you'll understand that when I tell you what I think's coming next,
[00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:52.350]  I'm not talking out of class.
[00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.330]  I'm not talking out of my ass.
[00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.789]  I'm talking out of my mind.
[00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.250]  So, What else did I tell you yesterday at the start of the show?
[00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:15.470]  I said, I expect Putin in the next few days, even sooner, will say this ICBM test was a test to show we can evade your anti-ballistic missile defense systems, and Ukraine is an armed camp of that.
[00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:27.649]  One of the biggest concentrations of that in the world, other than like D.C. or London or Moscow or Beijing.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:34.539]  And that he would then explain that it evaded it and that they could easily put hydrogen bombs on the missiles.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.919]  Within 15 minutes of me saying that, Putin goes live and word for word says the same thing.
[00:16:42.559 --> 00:16:43.100]  Hypersonic.
[00:16:48.129 --> 00:16:49.690]  Evade your defense systems.
[00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.490]  That's easy to know.
[00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.230]  The difference is, no one else was saying it.
[00:16:54.549 --> 00:16:57.710]  They were all going to just sit around and say, well, that didn't do much.
[00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.850]  Sure, it blew up a couple military factories.
[00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:00.570]  What's the big deal?
[00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:01.669]  Okay, got past us.
[00:17:02.289 --> 00:17:05.369]  It's a nuclear attack test that was successful.
[00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:23.369]  And just like when the Russians learned that their older, slower missiles in the 80s and early 90s could be shot down with space-based Gatling guns.
[00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:30.809]  Because again, you shoot a Gatling gun on the ground a mile away, the bullet falls even quicker.
[00:17:31.109 --> 00:17:32.450]  It doesn't have it in space.
[00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.529]  There's almost no friction.
[00:17:37.049 --> 00:17:41.309]  They've got Gatling guns up there that literally shoot.
[00:17:41.829 --> 00:17:45.589]  The word is similar to a.22 caliber bullet.
[00:17:48.269 --> 00:17:53.609]  And one of those going 30,000 miles an hour hitting a satellite or a missile can take it out.
[00:17:55.109 --> 00:17:58.890]  And it just shoots them down.
[00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.190]  But they've already done tests.
[00:18:01.349 --> 00:18:08.950]  You can't shoot one down going Mach 10, Mach 15. Even with the best computers.
[00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.089]  And this is not footage of a missile.
[00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:15.470]  People are saying that.
[00:18:15.529 --> 00:18:16.329]  I mean, it is a missile.
[00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:17.569]  It's the Russians sending a...
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.900]  Cargo payload into space from one of the space stations.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.880]  So, continuing.
[00:18:34.359 --> 00:18:35.440]  That's where we are.
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:42.779]  So, let me go over the articles, and then we'll go to the different scenarios that will unfold in the next...
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.559]  48 hours as well, probably sooner.
[00:18:47.099 --> 00:18:50.039]  Alright, on the current trajectory, it's like, where are we going?
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:19:03.180]  You know, all the pieces, it's as plain as the nose on your face, or that I'm wearing a red shirt, or that I got blue eyes, or this is a black microphone, or I got a stainless steel watch on, or I got water in this cup.
[00:19:04.119 --> 00:19:05.579]  It's a fact.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:07.460]  Alright?
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.720]  So the fact is, we're the closest nuclear war we've ever been.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:24.779]  The fact is, the globalist, new world order corporate banking system is coming to an end if they don't launch their new global government, cashless society, unified ledger system that takes full control of everything you do, everything you own.
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:33.759]  They take control, they monitor it all with AI and live time, and then penalize you if you don't behave exactly the way they want.
[00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:35.779]  So that's coming to an end.
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.460]  They need their total control.
[00:19:38.359 --> 00:19:39.839]  It's not going the way they wanted.
[00:19:40.119 --> 00:19:41.339]  Populists are getting elected everywhere.
[00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:42.960]  Anti-globals are getting elected everywhere.
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.740]  The world's awakening fast to them.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.039]  And so they want to bring in a global crisis to totally change the subject.
[00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:56.200]  We're going to have an excuse for austerity and lockdowns and rationing.
[00:19:56.319 --> 00:20:06.380]  And that would be a long conventional war with Russia or a limited nuclear war or a full nuclear war, which the Pentagon and others have been talking for years about how survivable one is and how it's not a big deal.
[00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:13.220]  And the Russians do simulations of nuking us back, and they're like, oh my God, the Russians are threatening us.
[00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:14.359]  The Russians are going to kill us.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:25.509]  When the Russians are putting out a deterrent and showing this, And firing ICBMs and hitting military targets saying you can't stop us as a deterrent.
[00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:26.569]  That's what Putin said.
[00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:31.789]  And I said he would come out and announce this was a deterrent nuke test, delivery system test of a nuke.
[00:20:31.869 --> 00:20:34.670]  And then he would say this is not a threat, it's a deterrent, please stop.
[00:20:34.869 --> 00:20:36.609]  Word for word said that 15 minutes later.
[00:20:36.809 --> 00:20:46.410]  Again, this is just real geopolitical military doctrine policies.
[00:20:47.849 --> 00:20:50.390]  That's what's frustrating, is this is so simple, actually.
[00:20:50.589 --> 00:20:55.990]  But you tell people, even in government this stuff, like senators and people, they think you're talking in Martian.
[00:20:56.809 --> 00:21:07.390]  Because the average person in government, and even the top generals, plays golf, they do nothing, they know nothing, they're lazy, they're stupid, they act official, they act informed, they act smart.
[00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:13.049]  They are people that inherited the system from great people.
[00:21:14.349 --> 00:21:23.730]  When there was a meritocracy in this country, and at least two generations in government and the military at the top, are the scum of the earth in the West.
[00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.970]  The actual globalists, you're talking five, six, seven generations of scum.
[00:21:30.019 --> 00:21:34.380]  Oh yeah, they had great grandpas and people that were really evil, but were competent.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.859]  These people now aren't.
[00:21:36.259 --> 00:21:37.839]  They thought Trump could be defeated.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.059]  They thought we'd buy the COVID lies.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.579]  At first we did, but it backfired.
[00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:44.720]  So all their old tricks aren't working anymore.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.900]  So, here we are yesterday.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.720]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:56.329]  World War III exclusive, a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia is secretly being negotiated behind the scenes by President Trump and Elon Musk.
[00:21:56.509 --> 00:22:02.970]  Plus, Russia successfully simulated a nuclear attack that could evade NATO defenses with their ICBM strike on Ukraine.
[00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.569]  That was all out before the show and is all confirmed now.
[00:22:07.839 --> 00:22:09.380]  Here's my post on X at 11 a.m.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:09.700]  Central.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:18.099]  World War III exclusive, a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia is secretly being negotiated behind the scenes by President Trump and Elon Musk.
[00:22:18.279 --> 00:22:24.279]  Plus, Russia's successfully simulated nuclear attack that can invade NATO's defenses with their ICBM strike on Ukraine.
[00:22:26.369 --> 00:22:30.690]  Now today, NATO boss Mark Root in Florida to visit Trump.
[00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:40.309]  And when you read the articles, they are discussing a ceasefire deal that wants Trump that would be done now or soon, the next few days or week.
[00:22:40.529 --> 00:22:45.329]  And then that would then lead in 56, 57 days to when Trump was put up.
[00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:46.269]  How many days is the election?
[00:22:46.509 --> 00:22:48.369]  I mean, to him being inaugurated.
[00:22:49.650 --> 00:23:02.650]  And then they would have a We're good to go.
[00:23:19.319 --> 00:23:24.960]  And you can read the articles where they are there to discuss the actual peace deal and get the agreement.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]  NATO's route visiting U.S. President-elect Trump.
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.700]  He is reportedly at Mar-a-Lago already.
[00:23:34.519 --> 00:23:37.019]  Or at least his advance team went in there about an hour ago.
[00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:41.599]  NATO chief to meet with Trump for talks on Ukraine.
[00:23:43.049 --> 00:23:44.009]  Washington Post.
[00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.630]  Right here, the media reports that Trump plans to focus on ending the war.
[00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:54.269]  One possible scenario includes freezing of hostilities and the creation of a buffer zone with military forces of European countries.
[00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:57.730]  Estonian foreign minister goes on.
[00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.849]  All right.
[00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:05.430]  Putin reportedly opened his ceasefire talks with Trump but demands Ukraine drop out of NATO, give up land.
[00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:06.750]  Same thing you just heard.
[00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:10.210]  So, there is all of that.
[00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:25.470]  We'll come back with more of this and then tie it into all the political news and the attacks on Trump's nominees, what's happening in the economy, what's happening in the Senate, and a bunch of other really vital information.
[00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:45.269]  Also, we're going to announce in the second hour today, and he's here, a retired Air Force veteran, won the AlexJonesStore.com Dodge Turbo Diesel Super Off-Road Godzilla truck and $10,000 cash.
[00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:50.589]  That's $146,000 value.
[00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.970]  And he's a supporter of InfoWars, supporter of thealexjohnstore.com.
[00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:56.650]  And he is the winner.
[00:24:56.809 --> 00:24:59.470]  And there is a new super awesome Ford Ford.
[00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:01.710]  Off-road truck.
[00:25:02.069 --> 00:25:04.430]  They asked me a month ago, well, what should the next truck be?
[00:25:04.509 --> 00:25:07.029]  So I poked around and said, I like this big Ford truck.
[00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:08.450]  I like this package.
[00:25:08.609 --> 00:25:09.849]  I like what's in it.
[00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:15.029]  I said, if I had the money to get a new Ford truck, my Ford truck is 12 years old, nothing against it, but I'd like a new one.
[00:25:15.329 --> 00:25:22.710]  This is probably what I'd get because it's a little less I mean, I just...
[00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:26.410]  I can't see spending $136,000 on that.
[00:25:26.509 --> 00:25:28.470]  I mean, this is still an expensive truck, but it's...
[00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:29.569]  That's the truck I'd like.
[00:25:29.829 --> 00:25:31.410]  So that's the truck I'd be driving.
[00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:37.950]  So anybody that buys anything on the stores put in 10X... In the sweepstakes.
[00:25:38.509 --> 00:25:53.529]  But separately, you really want to go to the AlexShoneStore.com, not just to keep us on air, even if InfoWars shuts down, because the AlexShoneStore.com is not owned by me, the Democrat Party, Everytown National Gun Control Group that is actually behind the onion and now admits they're behind the lawsuits,
[00:25:53.589 --> 00:25:59.490]  already told you that, to shut us down for the last seven years, and now reveal themselves, so we're suing all those groups.
[00:25:59.869 --> 00:26:01.069]  The suit's been filed.
[00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:06.650]  If you just simply go to the AlexShoneStore.com, And get the ultimate sea moss.
[00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:08.490]  It is the known ultimate seafood.
[00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:12.750]  Iris sea moss is a super concentrator.
[00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:21.250]  The equivalent of 40 grams of sea moss in each serving.
[00:26:21.589 --> 00:26:23.730]  And sea moss is full of the best form of iodine.
[00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:26.029]  All of these key vitamins and minerals.
[00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.069]  There's so many minerals that they say aren't essential.
[00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.630]  They really are.
[00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:29.690]  It's got...
[00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:32.009]  What is it?
[00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.869]  90 plus of the 100 plus that you need.
[00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:37.190]  So it's got almost everything.
[00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:38.950]  It's totally insane.
[00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:44.549]  And it is available right now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.349]  I tried to read to you all the benefits of it.
[00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:50.809]  It would obviously make your head spin.
[00:26:51.009 --> 00:26:57.849]  But you want Ultimate CMOS. It's up to 55% off and you get three bottles.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.720]  50 when you get two, 40 when you get one.
[00:27:01.859 --> 00:27:04.019]  There's so many other great supplements there as well.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.339]  The HydroForce is like vitamin, mineral fusion, but with electrolytes as well.
[00:27:08.079 --> 00:27:11.039]  And these are all private-labeled, already best-selling products.
[00:27:11.319 --> 00:27:14.359]  The other top producers make that we private label, and it keeps us on air.
[00:27:14.539 --> 00:27:22.160]  Go there now and get the Ultimate CMOS, HydroForce, the Energy Gummies, the Sleep Gummies, and so much more at the AlexShieldStore.com, and it keeps us on the air.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.000]  Take action now.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.740]  We'll be right back with all the news.
[00:27:25.359 --> 00:27:31.900]  I respectfully ask you to pay attention to what I'm about to say because it is critical in three important ways.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.519]  It'll keep my broadcast on the air.
[00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:47.190]  It will get you the highest quality amazing CBD that's so good for your whole body, inflammation, joints, You name it, and you're getting the best deal you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.410]  I've been promoting and selling CBD for more than 20 years.
[00:27:50.609 --> 00:27:54.829]  Everybody knows how amazing it is, but not all CBD is equal.
[00:27:55.349 --> 00:28:08.230]  This is a high quality, made in Texas, very strong CBD, thousand milligram tincture that has been put in nanoparticles, so it's eight to nine times stronger than regular CBD that already gives you great effects.
[00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:18.829]  On top of that, we private label it from a top company that sells it to a bunch of other companies that sell it from between $140 to $90 to $76.
[00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:25.710]  This is the lowest price you're going to find on CBD of this quality anywhere in the market.
[00:28:26.039 --> 00:28:28.700]  The industry just massively marks it up.
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:36.980]  There's still some good margin in here for our sponsor to support their operation and support us, and then that savings is passed on to you.

[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:28.740]  Rising from the ashes of censorship, it's Alex Jones.
[00:29:29.019 --> 00:29:34.559]  All of us together are going to lift the curse off of this country, and we're going to send the globalists to prison.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.779]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:29:39.059 --> 00:29:42.599]  First they come for Alex Jones, and then they're gonna come for us.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.000]  And they try to bankrupt Alex Jones or try to put Alex Jones in prison.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:53.019]  The demonization of Alex Jones should be of profound interest to everybody all across the board, even progressives.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.680]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:29:54.839 --> 00:29:57.799]  Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago.
[00:29:58.019 --> 00:29:58.480]  Listen!
[00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:04.420]  I don't know how all this is gonna end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one!
[00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:15.650]  The Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:23.849]  All right, we're back.
[00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:41.750]  So I just spent the first 30 minutes of the broadcast covering the fact that it's now breaking, that Trump's been having a global secret peace summit off and on for weeks at Mar-a-Lago, talking to the dictator of Ukraine's Zelensky,
[00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:54.829]  talking to the strongman of Russia, Vladimir Putin, talking to Xi Jinping, talking to Keira Starmer of the UK, talking to all the other world leaders and NATO to try to get a peace deal.
[00:30:55.589 --> 00:30:58.470]  And now, the head of NATO is at Mar-a-Lago.
[00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:04.130]  Told you that a few days ago, told you yesterday that was about to happen.
[00:31:06.339 --> 00:31:21.900]  I told you that I thought Putin would fire an ICBM to test the evasion of anti-missile ballistic systems, anti-missile systems, and then they did that,
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.960]  and then I said that Putin would come out and point that out.
[00:31:24.099 --> 00:31:25.400]  This is all simple, actually.
[00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:32.789]  I then said that soon they would be, within 48 hours, saying World War III has begun.
[00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:41.650]  And now we've got all these publications like the New York Times and the Hill and the Financial Times and others in the New York Post.
[00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:43.029]  Here's the headline.
[00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:47.150]  Ukraine's former military commander-in-chief delivers a chilling message.
[00:31:47.349 --> 00:31:49.210]  World War III has begun.
[00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:50.490]  The former head of their military.
[00:31:52.609 --> 00:31:55.329]  There's a lot of others saying it as well.
[00:31:58.279 --> 00:32:06.819]  We have Biden a couple years ago saying if we give them heavy weapons, it will start World War III. I mean, this is just known doctrinal information.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:13.019]  So when we get up here and say don't cross more of Putin's red lines, he's done having those crossed.
[00:32:13.839 --> 00:32:16.039]  He invaded Ukraine almost three years ago.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.299]  We hear from NATO, no, he'll back down, he'll bluff.
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.720]  We hear that from the Secretary of Defense.
[00:32:21.079 --> 00:32:24.700]  We hear from all the usual neocon suspects.
[00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:30.170]  Like John Bolton.
[00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:40.869]  So now we should talk about the possibilities of what can happen.
[00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:55.470]  Because it was easy to predict that when the Democrats were lame ducks during the time that President Trump was president-elect, that they would start bombing with the Tacums and Storm Shadows because that would destabilize things and give Trump a giant crisis.
[00:32:56.839 --> 00:33:01.200]  And let them continue to pump hundreds of billions of money that they launder large portions out of.
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.059]  And of course, they did that.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:11.400]  I said months ago, they'll probably start the bombing if Trump wins while he's president-elect.
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:11.940]  Easy.
[00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:14.279]  No one else was really saying it.
[00:33:18.779 --> 00:33:22.920]  So now we have to ask, will we get peace?
[00:33:23.119 --> 00:33:24.819]  Well, A, great job, Trump.
[00:33:25.609 --> 00:33:35.170]  We know why he hasn't made any announcements, why he hasn't said anything since the bombing started And again, I know there's that video out there from a year ago.
[00:33:35.349 --> 00:33:36.349]  Guys, you did it yesterday.
[00:33:36.589 --> 00:33:45.769]  Get the exact date of when Trump posted that on Truth Social and put it on screen from the original posting so people can put that baby to bed that he has not made a statement yet.
[00:33:46.309 --> 00:33:51.430]  His son said the military industrial complex wants to start World War III before my dad takes office.
[00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.049]  He said that Tuesday night.
[00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.930]  I totally agree with that.
[00:33:54.309 --> 00:33:55.430]  That's not Donald Trump.
[00:33:55.589 --> 00:34:02.660]  That's Don Jr. So I started saying three days ago, well, we know he's been doing behind-the-scenes peace stuff.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.839]  That's already been admitted.
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:05.960]  I made some calls.
[00:34:06.059 --> 00:34:07.940]  They said, yeah, there's basically a summit going on there.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:10.440]  This is what he's doing most of the time.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:21.519]  He's basically even distracted from the nomination fights and things because he's focused on this peace deal and trying to stop World War III. And I told you about that yesterday.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:25.079]  Now the head of NATO is in Florida, reportedly there.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.219]  At least a motorcade of NATO people were there about an hour and a half ago.
[00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:29.579]  That's my sources.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:30.380]  I'll stop there.
[00:34:32.579 --> 00:34:35.199]  So, this is a big deal.
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.699]  Good job, Trump.
[00:34:37.539 --> 00:34:47.599]  That's what we elected you to do, was to stop the conflicts and certainly stop the Ukraine disaster fiasco that is already in a new world war.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.219]  It's got all the ingredients of it.
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:51.420]  It's not a proxy war anymore.
[00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:57.019]  We were one millimeter from it when Biden started the bombing Tuesday.
[00:34:57.019 --> 00:35:12.159]  When England joined in the next day, that's multiple world powers together attacking another world power that is allied with China, North Korea, and Iran,
[00:35:12.179 --> 00:35:21.460]  who all have defense PACs, That if Russia's under attack, or one of them's under attack, and they call for aid, the other country must come into the aid.
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:34.340]  So now you've got all these powerful geopolitical countries with all these weapons, and you've got multiple powers on one side in a proxy war, and then now bombing inside the other country.
[00:35:34.739 --> 00:35:38.159]  That's the start of a new world war.
[00:35:39.219 --> 00:35:56.710]  Now technically, the CIA, declassified in 2006, That they and the Pentagon had been calling the entire Cold War World War III an asymmetrical, so they said a new global war would be called World War IV. So technically,
[00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:06.690]  this is the start of World War IV. People think of a World War, World War III, as nuclear.
[00:36:06.949 --> 00:36:10.909]  No, that's where it goes if it continues to escalate.
[00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:14.949]  Like a house on fire, if you don't put it out, it burns completely down.
[00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:16.570]  The house is on fire.
[00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:19.409]  It's in one room right now.
[00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:20.929]  The house is burning.
[00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:22.869]  We're in a world war.
[00:36:23.429 --> 00:36:29.190]  But if the fire department gets there in a couple minutes, it's just a fire in the kitchen.
[00:36:31.219 --> 00:36:34.119]  It hasn't burned through the ceiling yet into the second floor.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.760]  It hasn't got out of the kitchen yet.
[00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:37.460]  But soon it will.
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:45.219]  So every day, every hour, every minute really counts here.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.440]  So let's talk about the different players.
[00:36:49.699 --> 00:36:52.739]  Russia just wants to stabilize NBA players.
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:58.440]  Exporter of not just fertilizer and energy.
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.500]  They do not want conflict.
[00:37:00.679 --> 00:37:01.639]  They do not want to be an empire.
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.880]  But they do want their sphere of influence to be protected.
[00:37:05.619 --> 00:37:11.699]  They want economic success and conquest via the laissez-faire model.
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:35.519]  The Communist Chinese want to economically dominate the world through earth minerals and manufacturing, but also broke their deal with the globalists that they signed back in the 70s about 15 years ago, but the globalists broke with them about 12 years ago to the China pivot because China totally double-crossed the big Western financiers,
[00:37:35.659 --> 00:37:46.469]  the private central banks, That own the West and control the West and are the dominant force on the Earth, the globalist Anglo-American establishment, New World Order, transhumanist death cult.
[00:37:47.969 --> 00:37:56.969]  China was a giant laboratory experiment for them of all sorts of scientific horrors and one-child policies and social credit scores, and it still is.
[00:37:59.949 --> 00:38:10.170]  It's just they're not taking direction From the globalists now, as we saw in World War II, Hitler and Stalin, for the first two and a half years of the war, were allies.
[00:38:11.869 --> 00:38:22.010]  And then Hitler had intel that Stalin, Mr. Steele, was planning a sneak attack.
[00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:25.230]  So whether that was really going to happen or not, there's a lot of evidence it was.
[00:38:25.789 --> 00:38:27.530]  Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa.
[00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:28.889]  And then you know how that ended.
[00:38:29.769 --> 00:38:32.230]  Upwards of 50 million dead Germans and Russians.
[00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:45.269]  So, you look at the way humans behaved in the past and how they behave now, and there's too many data points to go in to explain it all, but most of you I know are very smart and probably know more than I do in many ways.
[00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:50.530]  When I say I know more than anybody on air, no one's going through all this detail on air.
[00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:51.369]  It's very frustrating.
[00:38:52.909 --> 00:39:08.719]  So, We've got leaks out of the UN, we've got leaks out of the military national complex, we've got public statements about the neocons, and the French leader, and the British leader, and all of them, other than Trump,
[00:39:09.079 --> 00:39:12.940]  Republican leaders, Democrat leaders, they want war, they want heavy bombing.
[00:39:16.599 --> 00:39:21.199]  Republicans, you know, shoot their mouths off about, kill Russians, you know, Lindsey Graham, blow up Moscow.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.280]  You do that, World War III for sure.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:28.289]  That's suicidal, megalomaniac, Just Satanism.
[00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:42.750]  And the big central banks and the private owners of those, they're willing to have wars, but they really don't want a total nuclear war either.
[00:39:43.570 --> 00:40:03.820]  But then their politicos and their operatives and their strategists, this is the way wars get out of hand, continue to incrementally ratchet up every time the West fails against Russia Until by successive approximation,
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:19.780]  you find yourself in World War III and the rapid, out-of-control gasoline fire of escalation.
[00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:36.969]  So, there have been a lot of groups before us and a lot of empires that try to have limited wars and if they go on long enough and then both sides won't give up, it always escalates into total war.
[00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:48.170]  And when you had total war 5,000 years ago or 500 years ago or 80 years ago, there weren't giant stockpiles of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
[00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:52.010]  And cyber attacks and all the rest of it.
[00:40:52.190 --> 00:41:10.110]  So one empire or one group would get destroyed and the other a lot of times would kind of wander off more often than not and collapse 10 years, 20 years, 30 years later because they had actually destroyed their own empire in the victory and that's called a Pyrrhic victory.
[00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:26.820]  So even if the globalists could win this war in its final destination if it continues on its path on its It would be a clear Pyrrhic victory for the globalists.
[00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:51.510]  And they would inherit a planet with an unlivable surface of the earth, even if they survived The billions that would die in the first day of the nuclear war and then all the different actuaries and estimates are about 90% of the survivors would starve to death and kill each other in the next year.
[00:41:53.429 --> 00:42:00.929]  And so you're talking about a couple hundred million people left and they're going to know where the goodies are.
[00:42:03.409 --> 00:42:05.449]  And they're going to get into those underground bases.
[00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:20.190]  And so you'll have these City-state warlord things on the surface that'll rise up.
[00:42:21.909 --> 00:42:25.610]  And they'll undoubtedly get a bunch of nukes that were cached here and there.
[00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:37.030]  And then they will immediately go to war, because that's what megalomaniacs do, with the globalists in their mineshafts.
[00:42:42.909 --> 00:42:45.730]  And there's a good chance no civilization will ever emerge out of that.
[00:42:45.869 --> 00:42:50.070]  It'll just completely collapse back into a mutant hellscape.
[00:42:54.409 --> 00:42:54.889]  So...
[00:42:58.519 --> 00:43:11.340]  The question is, will the different establishments understand that and get out of this compulsive, degenerate gambler scenario where everybody loses in this war?
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:17.099]  Just like the 1980s movie War Games where the computer finally plays through its nuclear war game and says, what a strange game.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.639]  The only way to win is not to play.
[00:43:21.659 --> 00:43:23.280]  And this is really simple.
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.159]  It's logical.
[00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:25.989]  Makes sense.
[00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:34.449]  You go into the complexities of it and then militarily, historically, economically, culturally, spiritually say, yeah, here's all the reasons you shouldn't do it.
[00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:36.389]  You could write a trillion books on it.
[00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:37.909]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:39.230]  Unending.
[00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:50.769]  But there are all these interests that want more conflict because it gives them political power and more control over the economies and money.
[00:43:54.329 --> 00:44:01.230]  And they are just betting that Russia will just continue to back down.
[00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:10.989]  But the problem is Russia backed down for 20-something years, and then Putin said, I'm done backing down in February three years ago, almost three years ago.
[00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.010]  And so that's not where we are.
[00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:18.650]  And even if he backed down again and again and again, NATO just keeps expanding.
[00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:22.849]  This started with Clinton.
[00:44:24.889 --> 00:44:39.650]  Years after Russia tried to come in and join NATO and give up its weapons and reform themselves with the Clintons bombing Serbia and handing a bunch of the country over to the Muslims.
[00:44:42.289 --> 00:44:44.969]  Serbs have been fighting Muslims for over a thousand years.
[00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.429]  First time they lost.
[00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:49.210]  Third of their country, give it to the Muslims.
[00:44:49.389 --> 00:44:50.090]  How would you like that?
[00:44:56.149 --> 00:45:01.590]  So, the Russians have been watching this for almost 30 years, and they're done.
[00:45:02.389 --> 00:45:04.409]  And anybody can look at that and see that.
[00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:07.369]  But even if they capitulate, well, when's they going to stop?
[00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:11.010]  They keep trying to internally, with color revolutions, overthrow the Russian government.
[00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.630]  And they call Putin unpopular.
[00:45:14.969 --> 00:45:18.590]  They've done international polls by agencies, scientific ones.
[00:45:18.869 --> 00:45:20.670]  Putin's got like 85% support.
[00:45:20.889 --> 00:45:23.150]  He'd have 90% if he was more warlike.
[00:45:23.409 --> 00:45:25.389]  The Russians want more war.
[00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:30.730]  And would you want war if you were in Russia's place and all the stuff the West has done to them?
[00:45:30.869 --> 00:45:31.610]  You bet you would.
[00:45:32.449 --> 00:45:37.389]  But Putin's a realist and knows, okay, you guys don't understand all this.
[00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:39.030]  You don't want a nuclear war.
[00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.989]  Okay, just stop it.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.539]  So they keep saying, hey, we can really hurt you.
[00:45:45.119 --> 00:45:48.460]  In response to the Secretary of Defense, everybody's saying, oh, Russia doesn't have good weapons.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.119]  They don't have any good nukes.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:54.880]  It's like, okay, well, I'll just show that you can't stop our missiles, and of course we have nukes.
[00:45:57.039 --> 00:46:00.099]  We've got more than you got, and better ones, and that's a fact.
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:05.280]  So...
[00:46:10.119 --> 00:46:15.820]  England, not the people of the UK, but their government is the old main global empire.
[00:46:16.239 --> 00:46:18.300]  And they still have the attitude that they run everything.
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:25.119]  And they're just basically part of the American empire, but they're right at the center of policy.
[00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:28.219]  Like a brain within a brain.
[00:46:29.679 --> 00:46:39.099]  And all the weakening of the public and the transgenderism and the laziness and the welfare state, it's all designed by them on record to control people and make us weak and stupid.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:44.239]  And Keira Starmer with the parliamentary manipulation got, what, like 17% of the vote?
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:46.420]  He doesn't have a mandate.
[00:46:50.079 --> 00:46:54.380]  But the way they wrote the rules, their party gets more seats per vote than anybody.
[00:46:54.539 --> 00:46:55.460]  I mean, it's totally rigged.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:09.960]  And they're the ones that really made sure when Russia invaded three years ago that no peace deal was done.
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:18.519]  And so, you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know that they want full war with Russia, but they want to be the good guys.
[00:47:18.679 --> 00:47:21.420]  So what would they do now while Trump's very close to getting a peace deal?
[00:47:21.699 --> 00:47:22.380]  Very close.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.860]  Because most of even Biden's advisors said, don't give him the missiles.
[00:47:27.019 --> 00:47:35.639]  You know, years ago, he's like, oh, we can't give him F-16s and Abrams tanks, that's World War III. And then, a year and a half later, he's giving them way worse stuff than that in the escalation ladder.
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:57.949]  So, Almost all of the advisors that are actually smart are telling Keir Starmer and Macron and Schultz and NATO, Stoltenberg and Rutt to stop it.
[00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:05.210]  Henry Kissinger, six months into the war, two years ago, came out in the New York Times and said, we need to make a deal and stop this.
[00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:06.230]  It'll lead to nuclear war.
[00:48:06.869 --> 00:48:07.389]  He's...
[00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:15.289]  Was not a good guy, but he said this is a stalemate and a nuclear stalemate is the end of the world.
[00:48:16.449 --> 00:48:24.050]  This is going to strengthen Russia, move away from the dollar, drive China and Russia together.
[00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:26.710]  And he was the guy that split them apart with Nixon.
[00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:28.650]  He said it needs to stop.
[00:48:28.789 --> 00:48:33.710]  He got put under so much pressure that he reversed himself three months later.
[00:48:36.179 --> 00:48:38.920]  So Henry Kissinger is saying what I said, okay?
[00:48:39.159 --> 00:48:41.760]  This is not playing with fire.
[00:48:43.719 --> 00:48:47.559]  This is pouring gasoline all over the world and striking a match.
[00:48:47.739 --> 00:48:50.699]  This is psychotic.
[00:48:52.579 --> 00:49:02.679]  So the question is, will people in the establishment that just want to live stop this, or will the people in the system stop?
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:19.500]  That are so used to having whatever they want and aren't really informed of the facts that they've convinced themselves that they're a bunch of white shoe lawyers that they can play soldier and do this.
[00:49:19.719 --> 00:49:21.980]  Because the Pentagon's telling them don't do this.
[00:49:26.579 --> 00:49:28.159]  So that's where we are.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:48.909]  And the obvious next move Is for a private corporation, a mercenary group, a global corporations, to detonate a nuke in Ukraine so they can cover up who did it,
[00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:59.630]  blow up some NATO ships somewhere with a small nuke, or blow up a nuclear reactor and blame it on Russia.
[00:49:59.789 --> 00:50:01.010]  Zelensky's already tried that a bunch.
[00:50:02.389 --> 00:50:07.670]  So if a peace deal gets reached, I think there's a very good chance of it.
[00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:14.610]  And people will get mad at Trump when he does a Marshall Plan and sends even more money to Ukraine.
[00:50:16.449 --> 00:50:27.110]  Trump has to understand, and he does, that the globalists will back down because they know all the facts are against them, but they want to feel like they win.
[00:50:27.789 --> 00:50:37.769]  So if Trump doesn't give Ukraine some big deal to rebuild them, which means a lot of the money will go to the corrupt people, they will not take the deal.
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:40.719]  So let's just get ahead of that now and know that.
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:46.480]  I'd rather give Ukraine a bunch more money than at World War III. And I'm just guessing what Trump's going to do.
[00:50:46.679 --> 00:50:47.900]  I'm not guessing he's going to do that.
[00:50:48.639 --> 00:50:50.079]  Because he's got to get him to do it.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:51:02.159]  And then it'll be off limits to prosecute the Democrats in the deep state for what they did.
[00:51:02.219 --> 00:51:03.420]  And that's what you do at the end of a war.
[00:51:03.579 --> 00:51:03.940]  You've won.
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:08.599]  You let the enemy capitulate so that they don't Turn over the chessboard.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:14.659]  And that's why you see a bunch of top Democrats like Mayorkas are, quote, planning their exit.
[00:51:14.659 --> 00:51:15.480]  I sent that to you.
[00:51:15.559 --> 00:51:16.300]  I didn't see it in my stack.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.380]  It's a headline.
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.800]  Mayorkas negotiating his exit so that he won't be prosecuted.
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:21.820]  Well, how does he do that?
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:29.840]  Well, the higher-ups in the globalist system say, fine, we'll roll over and let Trump come in, but you're going to have to leave us alone.
[00:51:30.599 --> 00:51:31.980]  Now, is that the right move?
[00:51:33.889 --> 00:51:36.409]  Morally it's not, but what are they doing?
[00:51:36.869 --> 00:51:44.630]  The globalists have a nuclear gun to the world's head saying, let us go, or we're going to blow your head off.
[00:51:48.989 --> 00:51:56.989]  And the only reason Trump could get a deal like this done is if he says he makes a deal with them, he will stick to it.
[00:51:57.050 --> 00:51:58.730]  And I'm not endorsing that deal.
[00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:01.670]  This is a show for grown-ups, okay?
[00:52:04.239 --> 00:52:05.900]  And all the different groups Trump's got to deal with.
[00:52:06.699 --> 00:52:08.599]  I understand why Trump's going to do it.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.039]  It's the only sure path out of this.
[00:52:11.519 --> 00:52:21.539]  Now, Trump could break his rule, why everybody wants to work with him around the world, of always telling the truth in deals and double-cross the globalists.
[00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:23.000]  And I think that's the right thing to do.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.280]  Look, they're too dangerous to be left operational.
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:29.860]  And they've committed too many crimes.
[00:52:31.059 --> 00:52:34.440]  And I don't double-cross people.
[00:52:37.059 --> 00:52:40.460]  I'm just like Trump, except when I double-cross him.
[00:52:40.739 --> 00:52:44.860]  At historic, key moments like this.
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:49.760]  And I probably shouldn't even be giving you Trump's mind, but I know Trump's mind.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:50.900]  Because I know.
[00:52:52.239 --> 00:52:54.800]  So, just give Trump leeway.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:53:06.440]  He's trying to stop World War III. I think the globalists will start infighting with each other, even if Trump makes a deal with them, and they'll destroy themselves and start robbing each other, because they all know where the money's hidden.
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:11.800]  And so I don't think Trump will even need to go after them.
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:17.260]  And in fact, Trump will wait till they break the deal, and then he will get them.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:19.780]  But that's the cart before the horse.
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:26.659]  So that's next level information.
[00:53:28.269 --> 00:53:30.570]  Because I respect you and I'm going to tell you what's really going on.
[00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:33.070]  And I know most of you can figure that out for yourselves.
[00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:35.170]  For those that can't, you just got the real scoop.
[00:53:35.329 --> 00:53:35.690]  We'll be right back.
[00:53:35.769 --> 00:53:36.150]  Hour number two.
[00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.690]  Please stay with us.
[00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:41.489]  The major central banks of the globe are owned by a handful of families.
[00:53:41.969 --> 00:53:54.050]  That's why the head of the private Federal Reserve last week, Jerome Powell, pledged to try to block Trump's agenda and said that even if Trump tries to fire him, he won't leave because he is above the law.
[00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:55.849]  They are a private agency.
[00:53:56.150 --> 00:54:00.369]  Some of the president-elect's advisers have suggested that you should resign.
[00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:03.130]  If he asked you to leave, would you go?
[00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:03.949]  No.
[00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:10.670]  Can you follow up on, do you think that legally you're not required to leave?
[00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:11.369]  No.
[00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:24.590]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically that there is no other agency of government Which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:54:24.789 --> 00:54:31.869]  But Congress created the private agency of the Federal Reserve and can revoke their charter and abolish them.
[00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:53.010]  And that's why it's so exciting to see former Congressman Ron Paul coming in to advise the administration And President Trump is striking right now.
[00:54:53.099 --> 00:54:56.099]  At the heart of it, going after their predatory loans.
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:55:03.480]  Now, in closing here, InfoWars is set to be sold at auction Wednesday, coming up in less than 48 hours.
[00:55:03.619 --> 00:55:06.320]  If good guys don't buy it, we will be shut down.
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:11.139]  But regardless, backups are being set up, new systems are in place with the Alex Jones Network.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:20.460]  And your sponsorship, supporting us at thealexjonesstore.com with great supplements, great Patriot apparel, like this great shirt, is what is going to keep us on air.
[00:55:21.519 --> 00:55:27.440]  We came out with three great limited edition fundraiser posters that are very, very popular.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:37.960]  And I decided a few days ago to design a new one, another limited edition that just came out today and has now been printed in Arkansas and is ready to ship to you.
[00:55:38.219 --> 00:55:39.079]  Here it is on screen.
[00:55:39.699 --> 00:55:40.260]  Iconic.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:50.800]  Takes the meme of what we predicted Harris would do trying to steal it, but that Trump would overpower the fraud, which is exactly what happened on the day of the election.
[00:55:51.510 --> 00:56:02.530]  On the eve of the election, on November 4th, on that Monday, last week, I posted that meme and I said, this is my prediction for the election and that's exactly what happened.
[00:56:02.849 --> 00:56:12.300]  So now it's that image, posterized, beautiful, striking, with Three simple words at the bottom.
[00:56:12.679 --> 00:56:14.380]  Back to back to back.
[00:56:14.579 --> 00:56:15.380]  That's right.
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:18.500]  He's the only president to ever run three times.
[00:56:18.699 --> 00:56:23.239]  And he's the only president to ever win in reality three times.
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.360]  He won in 16. He won in...
[00:56:26.029 --> 00:56:31.449]  2020 and he won in 2024, but this time the landslide was so big they could not stop him.
[00:56:31.769 --> 00:56:33.349]  This is historic.
[00:56:33.489 --> 00:56:37.570]  We've won the battle, now we've got to win the war to get him into office and drain the swamp.
[00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:43.869]  And to do that he's got to have folks like Infowars reaching 60, 70 million people a day right now.
[00:56:43.989 --> 00:56:49.150]  The most reach we've ever had thanks to you supporting and spreading the word and the world waking up.
[00:56:49.289 --> 00:56:53.949]  Everybody wants to hear what myself and the crew and the other reporters and our guests are saying.
[00:56:54.090 --> 00:57:01.010]  And to make sure we stay on the air, even if InfoWars shuts down, go to thealexjonesstore.com right now and get started.
[00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:02.690]  The Trump Patriot apparel.
[00:57:02.909 --> 00:57:03.809]  Get the posters.
[00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:07.570]  There's limited edition, and that will ensure we stay on the air.
[00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:10.449]  So for myself and the entire crew, history's happening now.
[00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:11.690]  Thanks for your support.
[00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:13.150]  God bless and good luck.
[00:57:13.369 --> 00:57:17.369]  Now go to thealexjonesstore.com and get these limited edition posters.
[00:57:17.610 --> 00:57:18.289]  Thank you so much.
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:42.559]  You think the United States would let Russia overthrow, say, Mexico or Canada and then station troops on our border and aim missiles at us?
[00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:45.820]  Would they accept firing the missiles into the United States?
[00:57:46.219 --> 00:57:47.420]  We're in their backyard.
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.300]  The globalists started this.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:53.480]  It's not Russia running around the world invading 20-something countries in the last couple decades.
[00:57:54.099 --> 00:57:55.699]  It's our criminal government.
[00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:58.860]  It's not Russia cutting off the Keystone Pipeline and oil drilling licenses.
[00:57:59.099 --> 00:58:04.280]  It's not the Russian government shutting down huge amounts of the farms in England.
[00:58:05.679 --> 00:58:13.619]  In the Netherlands, in Germany, in France, in Ireland, in Sri Lanka, and saying it's the Great Reset.
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:21.179]  We're getting rid of farming because, quote, particularly, quote, John Kerry, the London Guardian.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:22.179]  I'm not joking.
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:22.840]  This is not a joke.
[00:58:23.639 --> 00:58:25.360]  Organic farming is the worst.
[00:58:25.599 --> 00:58:26.239]  John Kerry.
[00:58:27.449 --> 00:58:34.309]  Farming is the third largest source of greenhouse gases that are part of the planet's atmosphere and are good, part of the life cycle.
[00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:35.409]  Didn't say that part.
[00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:39.650]  And we need to get rid of half the farming on Earth.
[00:58:39.789 --> 00:58:41.269]  You want to see the videos from this year and last year?
[00:58:41.389 --> 00:58:47.570]  And now they've cut off over a third of the fertilizer being produced in Europe.
[00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:54.789]  The Europe, counting Ukraine, is the largest producer of fertilizer in the world.
[00:58:56.139 --> 00:58:58.820]  And you cut a third of it, last time I checked, I think it's more now.
[00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:01.300]  What happens when you cut the fertilizer?
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:03.280]  That cuts the food yield.
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:09.760]  And so, London Guardian headline, organic farming is the worst for the environment.
[00:59:10.059 --> 00:59:13.460]  I mean, that's like saying, taking cyanide is good for your health.
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:15.280]  So...
[00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:18.659]  Yeah, there's Kerry saying, we gotta restrict the farms.
[00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:19.699]  We gotta cut the food.
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:23.199]  And he goes on to say, or people will starve.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:37.820]  So what they do is they pump out propaganda that's meant to be pure crap, but with authority to just get people conditioned to accept anything, like two men can have a baby, or there's no X and Y chromosomes, or we're gonna let men be in women's sports, including boxing, and beat women up.
[00:59:38.019 --> 00:59:43.239]  Yeah, there's the MIT. Sorry, organic farming is actually worse for climate change.
[00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:46.059]  So, And the headline's everywhere.
[00:59:46.179 --> 00:59:48.800]  London Guardian, AP Reuters, New York Times.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:50.159]  It's also in all those publications.
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:51.280]  Humans are bad.
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:52.159]  We should get rid of all humans.
[00:59:52.239 --> 00:59:53.059]  The future's not human.
[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:54.539]  Looking forward to the end of humans.
[00:59:54.719 --> 00:59:56.039]  Why the future doesn't need us.
[00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:57.460]  Why we don't need a human future.
[00:59:57.639 --> 00:59:58.699]  Just type in everything I said.
[00:59:58.840 --> 00:59:59.699]  You'll pull it up from them.
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:02.739]  Do those sound like good guys to you?
[01:00:04.409 --> 01:00:11.090]  How organic, how more organic farming could be worse for global warming, PBS, the NewsHour.
[01:00:11.329 --> 01:00:13.190]  So did Vladimir Putin do that?
[01:00:13.429 --> 01:00:25.570]  No, he announced eight years ago that Russia's main initiative when he cut defense spending by 40% was to put the money into organic farming and for Russia to be the leader in organic farming and good food in the world.
[01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.710]  Make the world healthy again.
[01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:33.090]  That would not be Maha, but would make the world healthy.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.440]  Healthy again, what would that acronym be?
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.760]  Organic food could be worse for the environment.
[01:00:38.019 --> 01:00:43.500]  More land and use to grow crops, which emits up to 70% more carbon.
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:46.280]  Dun, dun, dun.
[01:00:47.579 --> 01:00:49.320]  You know you're a carbon-based life form.
[01:00:49.519 --> 01:00:53.900]  You know you're the carbon the globalists want to reduce, right?
[01:00:54.059 --> 01:00:54.420]  You know that.
[01:00:54.539 --> 01:00:55.340]  Bill Gates has said that.
[01:00:55.559 --> 01:00:58.719]  So, and Elon Musk says, look, I think we should have more kids.
[01:00:58.719 --> 01:00:59.599]  Here's the actuaries.
[01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:01.960]  We don't have 2.1 kids for every two adults.
[01:01:03.139 --> 01:01:12.980]  For every family, for every marriage, for every men and women that get together and procreate, reproduce, in all the numbers, it's a fact, you have a civilizational collapse.
[01:01:14.179 --> 01:01:17.380]  Well, Italy's at 1.3, Japan's at 1.2, if I could go on.
[01:01:17.599 --> 01:01:23.400]  The U.S. indigenous population, whether they be black, white, Hispanic, American citizens born here, is about 1.7.
[01:01:23.579 --> 01:01:27.519]  So then you're told we need replacement migration with a bunch of brainwashed third world populations.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.300]  So that's where we are.
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.539]  And Russia's not doing any of that.
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:33.400]  Is Russia funding drag queen story time?
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.440]  Will convicted pedophiles with your children?
[01:01:36.599 --> 01:01:42.019]  Is Russia opening the border up and doing giant human trafficking for slave labor and sex slavery?
[01:01:42.139 --> 01:01:42.860]  Oh, no, not Russia.
[01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:46.710]  Did Russia get all our troops killed in all these funny wars?
[01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:47.030]  No.
[01:01:48.369 --> 01:01:50.469]  Maybe Russia attacked us in World War II? No.
[01:01:51.329 --> 01:02:09.630]  The West attacked Russia, British intelligence on record, put the Bolsheviks in in 1917. And then our own establishment, it wasn't Rosenberg's, our own government gave them the atomic secrets.
[01:02:12.329 --> 01:02:18.050]  Because Russia was a captured, globalist, leftist, Jacobin, satanic command base.
[01:02:19.289 --> 01:02:21.409]  And now Russia's gotten free of that.
[01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:26.889]  And the globalists are so incredibly angry about it.
[01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:31.269]  So we have a kinship with the Russians because they have the same enemies as us.
[01:02:31.389 --> 01:02:33.010]  We are now into hour number two.
[01:02:33.130 --> 01:02:37.750]  It is Friday, November 22nd, 2024. I'll be going through the entire four hours until 3 p.m.
[01:02:37.869 --> 01:02:38.389]  Central today.
[01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:42.090]  Then Ellen Schroyer will be hosting the War Room 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:46.409]  from the Infowars studios that we were kicked out of by the Justice Department illegally with no court order.
[01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:49.269]  Last Thursday, we were back in Friday.
[01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:51.070]  Where's the national news?
[01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:52.789]  The judge said the auction didn't happen.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:03:12.519]  We're good to go.
[01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:15.369]  The globalists will try to sabotage that.
[01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:16.909]  We'll be talking about it.
[01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:24.550]  I'll open the phones up to balance the broadcast and cover all the other news and the appointment fights and what's happening in the economy and more.
[01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:27.690]  But something very exciting is happening today.
[01:03:27.849 --> 01:03:29.309]  If you remember going back two months ago...
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:40.860]  We're good to go.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:56.059]  The Alex Jones Network at AJN Live on X. And we did when we got shut down just for a day last week.
[01:03:56.179 --> 01:03:57.380]  Before that, we'd done test broadcast.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:01.980]  Those broadcasts, that broadcast Thursday from there.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.699]  And we were still there Friday, even though we could get back in the building.
[01:04:04.719 --> 01:04:07.840]  We were already set there, so we did another day from the Alex Jones Network.
[01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:14.980]  We were able to tie into our studios here and stay on all the radio and TV satellites and reach tens of millions that way.
[01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:22.329]  We reached over 140 million people on X alone last Thursday and Friday.
[01:04:22.809 --> 01:04:24.670]  That's delivering the truth to the people.
[01:04:24.969 --> 01:04:37.309]  That's what you invested in when you go to thealexjonesstore.com and get incredible patriot apparel to spread the word and meet like-minded people when you get some of the most incredible supplements and fundraiser posters and more.
[01:04:37.469 --> 01:04:39.309]  You are at the tip of the spear.
[01:04:39.469 --> 01:04:39.929]  Not me.
[01:04:40.329 --> 01:04:45.929]  You are at the tip of the spear with me fighting the globalists with the key analysis and key guest.
[01:04:46.479 --> 01:04:49.559]  And reports that they absolutely hate.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.679]  So, Bigly's been around for a long time.
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:55.480]  They're some of the big sponsors of some of the top Patriot shows out there.
[01:04:55.599 --> 01:05:00.380]  They're, I think, the best designers and one of the top selling designers of Trump and Patriot gear.
[01:05:00.639 --> 01:05:02.300]  And they've been trying to work with me for a while.
[01:05:02.739 --> 01:05:04.539]  And I was just so busy not focused on it.
[01:05:04.599 --> 01:05:07.260]  But I did because I knew Infowars could be shut down.
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:12.019]  And so we needed a backup system, and they were a lot of folks we talked to and looked at.
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:18.239]  They were the best folks to work with, and they got their factories making knives and everything up in the t-shirts up in Arkansas.
[01:05:18.239 --> 01:05:19.960]  We wanted that to help American workers.
[01:05:20.159 --> 01:05:21.519]  They got a lot of veterans that worked there.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:31.820]  And they said, you know, we've done this for Crowder and a bunch of other people, over 100 hosts, giveaways of trucks and cars and off-road vehicles and all sorts of other cool stuff.
[01:05:32.159 --> 01:05:33.059]  We want to do it with you.
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.480]  They said, what type of truck do you like?
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:35.440]  And I said, well, this is a cool truck.
[01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:37.349]  And they said, okay, so they got it.
[01:05:37.409 --> 01:05:37.909]  Then I drove it.
[01:05:37.969 --> 01:05:39.030]  I was like, my gosh, I'd love this.
[01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:40.690]  It's so smooth, so amazing.
[01:05:41.369 --> 01:05:42.650]  $136,000 value.
[01:05:43.429 --> 01:05:47.690]  Just the baddest turbo diesel off-road package basically there is.
[01:05:48.389 --> 01:05:49.610]  It's just insane.
[01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:54.190]  I'm not knocking my 12-year-old Ford truck, but man, it is a rattled trap compared to this.
[01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:55.949]  Of course, the new Fords are super smooth as well.
[01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:59.530]  So this is not your granddaddy's pickup truck or even your pickup truck.
[01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:04.510]  And so anybody that bought product there on the site got entered to win.
[01:06:04.829 --> 01:06:06.809]  You didn't have to buy something.
[01:06:06.889 --> 01:06:09.170]  You can also put your email in and get entered once to win.
[01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:14.750]  But when you bought product, you got entered 5, 10x, depending on the day, it varied every day, into the sweepstakes.
[01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:22.849]  And so I also added on, I said, well, let's, so that's $136,000 truck, $138,000 truck at $2,000 cash.
[01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:27.650]  I said, let's add getting the winner here to Austin, Texas as well.
[01:06:27.809 --> 01:06:30.650]  So what a wild card.
[01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:36.449]  Who knows who the winner would be of tens of thousands of people that go buy products, and we have the winner here.
[01:06:36.929 --> 01:06:39.150]  And you guys are obviously Patriots.
[01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:40.130]  You're really...
[01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:41.949]  I watch your videos all the time, guys.
[01:06:42.489 --> 01:06:45.030]  Nate Hughes and Colin Sanders.
[01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:48.630]  But I just met Chris Delaro today.
[01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:52.170]  Learned he was the winner a few days ago.
[01:06:52.369 --> 01:06:56.150]  He's an Air Force veteran, a Patriot, but he came down to Austin, Texas.
[01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:57.070]  You guys flew him down.
[01:06:57.269 --> 01:06:59.650]  The folks at the AlexJoneStore.com.
[01:06:59.769 --> 01:07:01.409]  So very, very exciting.
[01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:04.230]  And it turns out he's been listening for a long time.
[01:07:04.969 --> 01:07:05.409]  Very...
[01:07:06.459 --> 01:07:12.219]  Interesting story, how he found the show, and it's just great to have him here.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:17.239]  So, Nate Hughes, Colin Sanders, you want to start first and tell us about this?
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:22.119]  This is a lot of fun, and I also can't wait, whether we're in these studios or not, this is going to continue on.
[01:07:22.579 --> 01:07:28.380]  In a few months, we'll have the new winner, and if they want to come here, they'll be here, and I can't wait to buy you lunch, brother.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.980]  I hope you can go on the other shows as well.
[01:07:31.139 --> 01:07:32.260]  So, who wants to start first?
[01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:33.110]  I can go.
[01:07:33.929 --> 01:07:41.929]  Yeah, Chris is the first official winner of the Alex Jones store giveaway, the first truck giveaway that I believe you've ever done, correct Alex?
[01:07:42.110 --> 01:07:42.269]  Yes.
[01:07:42.489 --> 01:07:46.590]  Yeah, first ever vehicle giveaway, $136,000 value giveaway.
[01:07:46.869 --> 01:07:47.889]  Chris is the big winner.
[01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:52.210]  I think you bought two t-shirts, was it two t-shirts, Chris?
[01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:53.289]  Two t-shirts, yes.
[01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:56.750]  Yeah, two t-shirts, so I think a $75 order.
[01:07:57.730 --> 01:08:06.989]  We've returned $136,000 truck, $10,000 in cash, and you get to come down here, be on the show with Alex, meet Alex, and we're going to eat some food here in a little bit.
[01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:09.849]  So I think it's awesome.
[01:08:10.349 --> 01:08:16.949]  Congratulations, and thank you, Alex, for allowing Bigly, myself and Colin, and our 100 employees back home in Arkansas.
[01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:21.250]  Thank you for giving us this opportunity, and we're just excited to be here and do this giveaway.
[01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:23.430]  Well, I want to go to Chris now, but I wanted to say this.
[01:08:24.449 --> 01:08:25.449]  I want to thank the listeners.
[01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:28.390]  They're all the winners and so are we.
[01:08:29.369 --> 01:08:41.710]  Hands down, 100%, we would not be on the air right now if you guys hadn't pestered the daylights out of me for over a year before and pestered my crew because I just get so busy and I'm not even really focused on money.
[01:08:41.869 --> 01:08:43.630]  I'm focused on the show, but I need money to fight.
[01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:47.350]  So we try to come up with things that are great people like so they get it and keep funding us.
[01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:55.180]  But I'm so glad we got to working with you because we wouldn't be here right now We're barely here right now.
[01:08:55.739 --> 01:09:02.600]  I'm having to sue the Democrat operatives, the gun control group, the Onion people, the U.S. trustee from the Justice Department for what they did.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:03.060]  We're winning.
[01:09:03.659 --> 01:09:04.979]  It takes a lot of money to do that.
[01:09:05.119 --> 01:09:05.720]  This is a fight.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:11.880]  The globalists are coming after me as a symbol of liberty, and they're going to keep harassing me and my family, but I'm a big boy.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.079]  I knew what I was getting into, but...
[01:09:14.079 --> 01:09:20.020]  We're good to go.
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:27.500]  We're good to go.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:32.560]  This is history.
[01:09:32.779 --> 01:09:34.260]  You are the reason we're here.
[01:09:55.779 --> 01:10:01.020]  Sung your praises extensively, which was completely appropriate, and I just would like to dovetail on that.
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:14.380]  You've made me a lot smarter person, and I don't mean to be obsequious, and it's a big word for sickeningly respectful, but I am sickeningly respectful, and this is a great moment in my life.
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:31.119]  I've had children, marriage, great careers, and this is pinnacle right here to be with someone who's Just restored truth, and it's just been a big part of my life, and I never imagined this.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.060]  Wow, this is incredible.
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:35.159]  What was the question?
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:35.800]  I'm a little nervous.
[01:10:35.859 --> 01:10:38.140]  No, no, Chris, I wanna be 100% clear.
[01:10:38.319 --> 01:10:38.840]  I am.
[01:11:02.619 --> 01:11:03.640]  It's you.
[01:11:04.150 --> 01:11:05.529]  Oh, I understand that completely.
[01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:08.909]  Let me tell you, those two guys right over there are incredible.
[01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:11.770]  I just got to know them with texting and phone calls.
[01:11:11.890 --> 01:11:12.890]  Yeah, thanks for harassing me.
[01:11:13.090 --> 01:11:14.390]  Absolutely, that's what we're here for.
[01:11:14.609 --> 01:11:14.670]  Thanks for the opportunity.
[01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:16.630]  They're for real.
[01:11:16.829 --> 01:11:25.869]  For us, it's a good versus evil fight, and we feel blessed to fight with the InfoWars team, and no matter what happens, we're here, and we'll keep Alex around for sure.
[01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:28.210]  Me and Nate are dedicated to that, so thank you.
[01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:30.109]  Nate's even had Lettis come attack his house.
[01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:30.369]  Yeah.
[01:11:30.579 --> 01:11:31.039]  Oh, yeah.
[01:11:31.239 --> 01:11:32.420]  And our business, damn it.
[01:11:32.659 --> 01:11:33.619]  They rated our business?
[01:11:33.979 --> 01:11:34.579]  Oh, yeah.
[01:11:34.739 --> 01:11:39.319]  Yeah, they rated me for J6 at the office, right in front of the office.
[01:11:39.399 --> 01:11:40.960]  They staked it out for two years, which is crazy.
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:47.159]  Then, yeah, I had a guy two weeks ago come tear down my Trump sign and cut down my American flag off my property.
[01:11:47.159 --> 01:11:48.880]  And he's the son of a Democrat state rep.
[01:11:48.979 --> 01:11:49.500]  That was a setup.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:50.819]  Yeah, wasn't that crazy?
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.039]  I think they were trying to get me to do a reaction with that.
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:53.220]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:58.399]  But, I don't know, I've become smarter than that over the last two years, I feel like.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.560]  I'm kind of retarded.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:03.579]  And tell them for J6, because I've seen someone handed you a shield and you set it down.
[01:12:04.039 --> 01:12:06.359]  Yeah, so, yeah, J6 was wild.
[01:12:06.539 --> 01:12:14.800]  So, the big thing that I'm in trouble for over J6 is there was a riot shield that was passed over the head of a person in front of me, and I passed it behind me.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:21.409]  Now I'm convicted of Felony civil disorder and felony impeding police and blocking the entrance to a Capitol.
[01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:25.170]  And I thank God every day that President Trump won this election.
[01:12:25.489 --> 01:12:39.449]  And I pray to God that he's going to free us and free all the rest of the political prisoners from the J6ers to the people that prayed in front of the abortion clinics to Tina Peters who outed election fraud in Colorado to, I mean, shit, Edward Snowden.
[01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:40.390]  You go down the line, right?
[01:12:40.609 --> 01:12:40.710]  Yep.
[01:12:40.810 --> 01:12:41.369]  Yep, there we go.
[01:12:41.829 --> 01:12:42.750]  There's the action shot.
[01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:43.750]  Yeah, 100%.
[01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:45.829]  And tell everybody what you're facing.
[01:12:46.409 --> 01:12:50.170]  You know, Trump winning literally kept you free, but tell everybody what you're facing.
[01:12:50.369 --> 01:12:58.449]  So five to eight years in prison is what they want from me, while a leftist Antifa protester can go burn down a whole damn city block.
[01:12:58.819 --> 01:13:00.199]  And they get their charges dropped, right?
[01:13:00.279 --> 01:13:00.739]  It's crazy.
[01:13:00.979 --> 01:13:02.260]  It's political persecution.
[01:13:02.439 --> 01:13:06.460]  They're coming after people that are against the system, and this is not right versus left.
[01:13:06.539 --> 01:13:09.279]  It's the people versus the establishment, the corrupt system.
[01:13:09.579 --> 01:13:12.680]  And we took a W on November 5th.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.359]  And Chris took a big W with one in this truck.
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:16.579]  It's all positive energy, right?
[01:13:16.739 --> 01:13:19.319]  We just got to keep the positive vibes going, and we got to keep...
[01:13:19.319 --> 01:13:20.340]  We've got the initiative.
[01:13:20.579 --> 01:13:21.159]  We're winning.
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:22.199]  We got the momentum, so...
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:24.779]  Chris, you were talking about how you found the show.
[01:13:25.079 --> 01:13:28.699]  I was talking before the show, you're an eloquent guy.
[01:13:29.659 --> 01:13:31.460]  What do you want to talk about here to the millions of viewers?
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:32.880]  Wow.
[01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:38.659]  Well, I was telling the gentleman across the table that I think we need to have...
[01:13:39.789 --> 01:13:40.930]  How did I phrase it?
[01:13:41.909 --> 01:13:43.109]  Sound mind doctrine.
[01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:43.750]  Yeah.
[01:13:43.869 --> 01:13:45.609]  Well, first, let me say what my dentist told me.
[01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:50.529]  He said, we need to have an amendment to the Constitution where we have health freedom and we can reject shots.
[01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:51.149]  Absolutely.
[01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:52.149]  We go that far.
[01:13:52.329 --> 01:13:53.270]  He's a great doctor.
[01:13:53.890 --> 01:14:00.949]  He's very, but a sound mind doctrine, meaning it's okay if you want to take drugs and be happy to go out the door and live your life.
[01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:06.210]  But if you are presiding over anyone's future, you need to take a blood test every couple weeks randomly.
[01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:07.489]  A blood test, not a urine.
[01:14:08.150 --> 01:14:12.850]  And if you fail for any psychotropic drugs, you're out.
[01:14:13.210 --> 01:14:14.670]  Anyway, that's a good point.
[01:14:14.789 --> 01:14:19.029]  They say something like half of Congress are on speed and antidepressants.
[01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:19.529]  Yeah.
[01:14:19.770 --> 01:14:35.350]  There was an article that you put out where I get truth, and it was a pharmacist in the basement of the Capitol, and he said, I'm giving these people strong drugs, and they're taking a lot of them, and they're making laws and running the government.
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.000]  And that was alarming.
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.100]  And then you never heard from him again.
[01:14:38.239 --> 01:14:39.699]  They said, well, let's just quiet that down.
[01:14:39.779 --> 01:14:40.600]  I don't know what happened.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:40.960]  Right.
[01:14:41.479 --> 01:14:43.060]  But it's alarming.
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:50.680]  And as I was mentioning to you guys in Revelation 18, 23, by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.800]  And if you touch sorceries and get to the concordance, pharmakia.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.300]  I'm sure this has been gone over many times.
[01:14:55.439 --> 01:14:55.800]  Drugs.
[01:14:56.119 --> 01:14:56.479]  Pharmakia.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:58.760]  Pharmacy is the root word.
[01:14:59.159 --> 01:14:59.819]  Well, exactly.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.619]  Sorcery means basically take drugs.
[01:15:01.739 --> 01:15:05.319]  Yeah, so they deceive the entire world there, so that has taken place.
[01:15:05.319 --> 01:15:09.340]  So the prophecy of the Bible is quite accurate, of course, as you know.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:10.239]  No, you're dead on.
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:12.260]  No, I'm glad you raised that, because we don't raise that enough.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:13.859]  So tell us about yourself.
[01:15:13.859 --> 01:15:14.579]  You're an interesting guy.
[01:15:14.819 --> 01:15:16.140]  Well, I'm a family man.
[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:16.819]  I'm retired.
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:19.060]  I've had a good career, and...
[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:24.699]  My wife and I, we're gonna be living in Monte Carlo.
[01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:29.000]  But 1979 Monte Carlo, it's up on blocks.
[01:15:29.279 --> 01:15:30.340]  Got a big back seat.
[01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:31.720]  All right, that was a little joke.
[01:15:32.119 --> 01:15:34.180]  No, we're gonna now be living in the truck.
[01:15:35.779 --> 01:15:37.439]  Alright, thank you for the courtesy chuckle.
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.880]  I thought you were really moving to Monte Carlo.
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:48.079]  I know, it's like a Johnny Cash song where I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die, so ultimate arrogance.
[01:15:48.359 --> 01:15:52.100]  And when I hear that whistle blow and I hang my head and cry, it's the ultimate humility.
[01:15:52.699 --> 01:15:54.920]  I hang my head and cry.
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:58.380]  You go from the finest neighborhood on the planet to homelessness and like...
[01:15:58.850 --> 01:15:59.369]  One verse.
[01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:01.170]  So it's a little humor there.
[01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:03.369]  No, I live in New Jersey.
[01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:08.510]  Just saying it for my Jersey people, but I kind of live in a stronghold of wokeism to some extent.
[01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:10.090]  It's hard to say.
[01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:13.810]  You know, you don't really want to have a conversation every day.
[01:16:13.810 --> 01:16:16.670]  It can get ugly, so I don't check people out that way.
[01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:20.829]  We dance around the subject sometimes and sometimes get to truth, but...
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:22.260]  In any case, yeah.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:27.779]  So I was an aviator for my career, and I worked 34 and a half years.
[01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:28.739]  What'd you fly?
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.560]  I retired off the 777 International.
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:32.279]  Wow.
[01:16:32.579 --> 01:16:33.659]  Yeah, it was exciting.
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:34.300]  Tremendous.
[01:16:34.399 --> 01:16:35.920]  Last great Boeing airplane.
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:43.060]  The engineering masterpiece would fly like 16, 17 hours to India, and it just did everything.
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:49.399]  It was back when the Boeing engineers were allowed to be creative, you know, and now everything's become about money.
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:53.520]  And prior to that, I had a military career, and I was fortunate enough and blessed enough, it was a high point.
[01:16:53.579 --> 01:16:57.920]  I was an F-16 pilot for seven years, and we did it in an unusual role.
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.659]  We were an air defense unit.
[01:16:59.659 --> 01:17:01.659]  It was designed as a day VFR fighter.
[01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:10.380]  But we were flying a much older jet before that, the F-106 Delta Dart, as interceptor pilots out of Atlantic City.
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:16.000]  And we would go put eyeballs on Russian planes, which I did once or twice.
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:18.979]  But I took some pictures once, and I got on the front page of the newspaper.
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:21.260]  I love how cool our listeners are.
[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:21.880]  He's a badass.
[01:17:21.939 --> 01:17:23.100]  He's a fighter pilot.
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:23.720]  Let's go.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:24.439]  I love that.
[01:17:24.930 --> 01:17:25.909]  Yeah, that was a good case.
[01:17:25.949 --> 01:17:26.350]  From New Jersey.
[01:17:26.449 --> 01:17:27.869]  From New Jersey, not New Hampshire.
[01:17:27.989 --> 01:17:33.310]  It gave me credibility that I might not really deserve, but I was able to survive the programs, and here I am.
[01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:41.310]  But I mean, I kind of wish I was telling these guys, I wish I'd won this by writing a good essay, but all I did was draw my name, but I'm like, I will take it.
[01:17:41.529 --> 01:17:45.510]  It makes me think, though, imagine how cool all the other listeners are.
[01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:46.489]  Oh, for sure.
[01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:47.850]  The majority are like that.
[01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.970]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:52.970]  Another interesting note too, Chris, you ordered on the first day of the Alex Johnson.
[01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:53.550]  Okay, I saw Nate.
[01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:57.029]  September 11th, so the launching day, which is awesome.
[01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:58.170]  So thank you for that support.
[01:17:58.210 --> 01:17:59.810]  And I know you guys use a big company to do it.
[01:17:59.890 --> 01:18:00.390]  It's all scientific.
[01:18:00.569 --> 01:18:01.470]  I mean, how does that work?
[01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:02.050]  You were telling me about it.
[01:18:02.050 --> 01:18:02.250]  We do.
[01:18:02.369 --> 01:18:05.109]  We use a third-party vendor called Sweepstakes Pro.
[01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:06.510]  So it's federally registered.
[01:18:06.510 --> 01:18:09.029]  It indemnifies us, so we have to follow the rules.
[01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:11.630]  The rules are pre-made before the date.
[01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:15.890]  So if it's 10X, we decided that before, right, and put that in the rules.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:22.319]  VIPs, if you're listening, next week there is a lot of special stuff coming for you guys.
[01:18:22.579 --> 01:18:23.760]  Black Friday, Cyber Monday.
[01:18:23.939 --> 01:18:25.619]  Black Friday, Cyber Monday is coming.
[01:18:25.859 --> 01:18:28.199]  For the best deals on the internet, you know Alex.
[01:18:28.359 --> 01:18:29.979]  He's going to tell you all about his lost leaders.
[01:18:30.159 --> 01:18:34.960]  He's going to be pretty fucking pissed at us next week because we've got a lot of good things coming for you guys.
[01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:37.210]  Well, I'm not mad about him getting good deals.
[01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:40.189]  If we sell super tons, then we get money.
[01:18:40.670 --> 01:18:42.890]  But man, I mean, I'm fighting the Justice Department.
[01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:45.390]  That's why Trump won, folks.
[01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:46.250]  You gave him billions of bucks.
[01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:47.109]  I don't need billions.
[01:18:47.109 --> 01:18:47.670]  I need millions.
[01:18:47.670 --> 01:18:49.090]  But I'm fighting the same damn people.
[01:18:49.609 --> 01:18:51.010]  And I mean, I'll beg.
[01:18:51.149 --> 01:18:51.949]  All I want to do is beat them.
[01:18:52.029 --> 01:18:52.670]  I mean, what do I got to do?
[01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:53.630]  Because seriously, the...
[01:18:54.229 --> 01:19:01.670]  I'll tell you, when they said they took over last week, killed the M4 store, even though they didn't, and they don't own the Alex Jones store, but it hurt it bad.
[01:19:01.829 --> 01:19:08.949]  Explain to people, even if the Onion Weasels take this over, which we don't think will happen because we're fighting them, they're not taking over your company, it's separate.
[01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:10.010]  Absolutely, yeah.
[01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:12.050]  We are completely separate from InfoWars.
[01:19:12.189 --> 01:19:12.989]  We're separate from Alex.
[01:19:13.649 --> 01:19:17.189]  It's thealexjonesstore.com, but they can't shut us down.
[01:19:17.289 --> 01:19:20.289]  I mean, they can come after us and they can do the same thing, but they're not going to shut us down.
[01:19:20.569 --> 01:19:26.289]  No matter if we've got to go over it, under it, around it, through it, we will accomplish the objective and we're going to win.
[01:19:27.449 --> 01:19:28.529]  I'm not mad at the listeners.
[01:19:28.689 --> 01:19:30.270]  I just didn't think they'd have to tell them.
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:32.319]  Hey, no, no.
[01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:37.140]  The Alex Jones store is for the Alex Jones network and everything else and supporting this, but they can't get it.
[01:19:37.199 --> 01:19:38.079]  They have no claim to it.
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:39.119]  I have zero ownership.
[01:19:39.579 --> 01:19:39.720]  Yep.
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.800]  Yeah, it's completely separate from InfoWars.
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:44.159]  If InfoWars shuts down, we are not missing a beat.
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:47.359]  We will keep going on the Alex Jones network and the Alex Jones stores.
[01:19:47.659 --> 01:19:51.060]  And I appreciate you guys because, you know, you guys aren't communists.
[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:52.279]  You got a lot of crew and a lot of people.
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:56.300]  You guys really foregoed, you know, some of the profit you'd make because you understand we need it.
[01:19:56.659 --> 01:19:56.979]  100%.
[01:19:56.979 --> 01:19:59.520]  I mean, because all my children, this is not about money, folks.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:05.880]  I am fighting with everything I got right now against really bad people who've promised to put me in prison and threaten me for what I'm doing.
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.760]  I don't care about getting put in prison or any of that.
[01:20:07.859 --> 01:20:08.420]  I mean, I don't want to be.
[01:20:08.539 --> 01:20:09.619]  But I'm not stopping.
[01:20:09.819 --> 01:20:11.039]  Only you can stop me.
[01:20:11.399 --> 01:20:11.960]  Share the article.
[01:20:12.119 --> 01:20:12.680]  Share the videos.
[01:20:12.819 --> 01:20:13.439]  Pray for us.
[01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:16.390]  Share the links on your email, your text messages.
[01:20:16.569 --> 01:20:17.069]  Share it everywhere.
[01:20:17.210 --> 01:20:20.729]  They hate this broadcast and support us at thealexshowstore.com.
[01:20:20.909 --> 01:20:26.050]  Yeah, there I am last Friday with the sink, just like when Elon came into Twitter and took it over.
[01:20:26.189 --> 01:20:28.609]  I mean, notice they've been real quiet right now.
[01:20:28.770 --> 01:20:29.750]  They don't know what to say now.
[01:20:29.829 --> 01:20:30.689]  Like, you took it over.
[01:20:30.710 --> 01:20:31.630]  Why am I here a week later?
[01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:33.430]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:20:33.630 --> 01:20:40.250]  Alex, when you fight back against these people, they go and cower like the cowards that they are, right?
[01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:43.010]  A lot of these people, they talk all this trash, all this shit, right?
[01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:48.729]  But once you confront them and say, like Gandalf in Lord of the Rings, you shall not pass, right?
[01:20:48.789 --> 01:20:51.689]  You do that, and it scares them, right?
[01:20:51.789 --> 01:20:53.170]  They run and hide, so...
[01:20:53.399 --> 01:20:54.699]  But you've got to really do it.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:55.359]  100%.
[01:20:55.359 --> 01:20:56.539]  I mean, that's what we've done.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.180]  We're like, in fact, we should come back from break with that, with the bull rock chasing him.
[01:21:00.659 --> 01:21:03.579]  Maybe have a minute of it before, and then he stops, and then the bull rock comes.
[01:21:03.899 --> 01:21:05.460]  But notice, he thinks he's done.
[01:21:05.619 --> 01:21:06.380]  He's like, ugh.
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:07.739]  It gets him, though.
[01:21:07.859 --> 01:21:07.979]  Yeah.
[01:21:08.159 --> 01:21:09.600]  But he comes back even stronger.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:10.520]  It's all those archetypes.
[01:21:10.619 --> 01:21:13.180]  Like, Trump was Gandalf, got sucked down into hell.
[01:21:13.399 --> 01:21:14.960]  Now he's come back Gandalf the White.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.979]  It's the hero's story or the hero's journey, right?
[01:21:18.159 --> 01:21:21.899]  You know, Trump has come full circle, and I just, you know, I pray these appointments go good, right?
[01:21:22.039 --> 01:21:23.619]  Like, he's doing a great job so far.
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:28.460]  But I want to explain something to listeners, because I never think about marketing or, you know, like some plan.
[01:21:28.579 --> 01:21:29.659]  I just think about how do I think.
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:33.220]  Like, if I like something I said, if I think something I said, it turns out the audience is like me.
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:38.060]  So there's no, like when the Democrats sued us, when all this discovery, they go, who's telling you what to do?
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.020]  What's the plan?
[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:40.720]  There's no planning documents around here.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.439]  It's just what do we think the truth is?
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:45.239]  We're not perfect, but we get it right more than almost anybody else.
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:50.060]  And I really shouldn't even just plug this, hey, keep me on air.
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:52.579]  Folks, this isn't some snake oil.
[01:21:53.810 --> 01:22:01.170]  I mean, sea moss is really recognized as probably the super plant other than like hemp, and hemp does different things than this.
[01:22:01.489 --> 01:22:10.510]  Sea moss has all of these minerals that they say aren't essential but really are, and the regular minerals, and the way the plant grows it, and then the...
[01:22:11.789 --> 01:22:15.310]  Powdered caplets are the equivalent of 40 grams of the key ingredients concentrated.
[01:22:15.670 --> 01:22:19.270]  The gummies are the equivalent of 20 times, so the capsules are even stronger.
[01:22:19.649 --> 01:22:21.109]  I've been gobbling this for months.
[01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:22.229]  That's part of why I'm so healthy.
[01:22:22.369 --> 01:22:23.930]  I've lost weight while my skin's shining.
[01:22:24.090 --> 01:22:26.229]  I mean, this is energy, but it doesn't feel like speed.
[01:22:26.569 --> 01:22:27.729]  Great for your whole immune system.
[01:22:27.869 --> 01:22:29.029]  It is magic.
[01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:30.229]  I mean, you know, you think...
[01:22:30.579 --> 01:22:32.220]  You know, the old days they knew spinach was good for you.
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:32.859]  It was folic acid.
[01:22:33.399 --> 01:22:36.619]  Spinach is like cardboard compared to this, nutritionally.
[01:22:36.899 --> 01:22:37.220]  Okay?
[01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:44.239]  It is a super food, and you guys private label it from one of the top companies, because you said, hey, we're going to go into supplements, because you know you want them.
[01:22:44.319 --> 01:22:46.140]  We're talking like months and months and months for your sponsor.
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:47.560]  We're about to do it.
[01:22:47.659 --> 01:22:49.380]  And I said, well, here's the places I'd use.
[01:22:49.479 --> 01:22:50.000]  Here's the groups.
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:52.180]  All you do is private label already a top brand.
[01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:53.000]  Then it's all certified.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:53.680]  It's already loved.
[01:22:53.779 --> 01:22:54.380]  It's already tested.
[01:22:54.939 --> 01:22:56.619]  Obviously, you test it again, because that's the law.
[01:22:56.819 --> 01:22:58.779]  And then we know we're selling them something.
[01:22:58.899 --> 01:22:59.720]  You know, it's like...
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:13.659]  We're good to go.
[01:23:17.329 --> 01:23:20.210]  And at 55% off of three bottles, we're not making much.
[01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:21.609]  The 40%, we make some good money.
[01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:24.770]  But it's competitively priced compared to the best CMOS out there.
[01:23:24.909 --> 01:23:28.350]  You need Ultimate CMOS, and you need to keep us on air fighting these bastards.
[01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:29.770]  Go to thealexchillstore.com.
[01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:30.710]  You will not be disappointed.
[01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:32.029]  We're going to break in a minute, Chris.
[01:23:32.130 --> 01:23:33.970]  We're going to come back and talk more with you guys about the world and news.
[01:23:34.069 --> 01:23:36.489]  But are you disappointed with your purchase of two T-shirts?
[01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.750]  Not at all.
[01:23:37.869 --> 01:23:38.289]  Not at all.
[01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:45.069]  I was excited about a bug-out vehicle, but I was saying, where are you going to bug out when you're bugging out the tires and the glass melt?
[01:23:45.369 --> 01:23:45.689]  Yeah.
[01:23:45.829 --> 01:23:52.529]  That's where we are, so it's a little beyond alarming that we're dealing with fiendish people, and so there we are.
[01:23:52.630 --> 01:24:02.149]  But, you know, the day that they were shutting you down, the bad people, I got a text from Colin, and it was just a name, like you would see, Colin Sanders, like, do I know a Colin...
[01:24:02.449 --> 01:24:05.510]  And he said, hey, Chris, this is Colin Sanders at Bigley and Alex Jones.
[01:24:05.710 --> 01:24:06.510]  I was like, yeah, sure.
[01:24:06.630 --> 01:24:07.010]  A text.
[01:24:07.170 --> 01:24:07.829]  And I delete.
[01:24:08.229 --> 01:24:08.850]  Then I got another one.
[01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:09.149]  Delete.
[01:24:09.649 --> 01:24:12.630]  And then later that day, he's like, we're going to have to move on.
[01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:15.850]  I got a phone, voicemail, phone call, and a text.
[01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:18.529]  And I'm like, maybe I should listen to the voicemail.
[01:24:18.850 --> 01:24:20.270]  And then I talked to Colin.
[01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:23.250]  That's like people that find the winning lottery ticket later.
[01:24:23.729 --> 01:24:24.770]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:24.930 --> 01:24:25.949]  There was that guy in California.
[01:24:25.949 --> 01:24:27.090]  So what did you think they actually called you?
[01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:28.170]  You actually talked to him?
[01:24:28.649 --> 01:24:30.489]  I was kind of calm, but it was surreal.
[01:24:30.710 --> 01:24:31.390]  It was like...
[01:24:32.399 --> 01:24:37.920]  Yeah, because I knew immediately I clicked back to you saying, well, I saw the day that I saw Nate.
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:42.840]  I was like, that's past me, you know, with hair and stuff, you know, my growing up and so forth.
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.779]  And I liked him immediately, and I liked...
[01:24:44.779 --> 01:24:46.180]  You're like, what's this hippie doing?
[01:24:46.939 --> 01:24:47.659]  I'm joking.
[01:24:48.199 --> 01:24:49.239]  That's a little secret.
[01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:51.619]  The rednecks have had long hair before the hippies.
[01:24:51.699 --> 01:24:52.420]  Hell yeah, we have.
[01:24:53.199 --> 01:24:55.159]  What is that Charlie Daniels song?
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:56.939]  Long-haired country boy.
[01:24:57.319 --> 01:24:59.399]  Leave this long-haired country boy.
[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:05.579]  I am cutting this important announcement right in the middle of the November 5th, 2024 election.
[01:25:05.739 --> 01:25:07.140]  We'll be running this for a week or so.
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:12.960]  And it looks like a big Trump win, but they are in full steam ahead with election fraud at levels that were foreseen.
[01:25:13.699 --> 01:25:28.659]  Regardless of whether we're able to defeat this fraud or not, the awakening of And the massive amount of support for Trump and traditional liberals and others waking up and joining us and realizing the Democratic Party ally with the neocons is cancer has been incredible.
[01:25:28.659 --> 01:25:31.359]  And it's part of the larger global realignment happening all over the planet.
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:34.619]  But we can't control everything individually.
[01:25:34.619 --> 01:25:36.460]  We can just work towards a better outcome.
[01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:38.300]  And it's a process and we're starting to get traction.
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:39.340]  And I've got faith.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:58.310]  But regardless, with all the garbage and all the viruses out there and all the drug-resistant and Antibiotic resistant bacteria and crap that's out there, especially in the winter when our immune systems are down, it is so important to boost our body's defenses naturally that God gave us.
[01:25:58.789 --> 01:26:02.210]  Now, if you go to our great sponsor, DrJonesNaturals.com, there's a lot of great products.

[01:26:36.810 --> 01:26:42.869]  Most competing brands, say, of CoQ10 of this quality and this dose, on average are about $60 a bottle.
[01:26:43.810 --> 01:26:47.430]  This is way, way lower than that, and it funds the Infowar.
[01:26:47.609 --> 01:26:51.609]  And then, of course, Quercetin Max, really strong, high-powered Quercetin.
[01:26:51.670 --> 01:26:54.289]  Let me tell you, in case you don't know, what these do.

[01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.909]  This is admitted.

[01:27:10.699 --> 01:27:13.319]  I mean, you just ask chat GPT this and it'll tell you.

[01:27:22.619 --> 01:27:23.180]  That's the big one.

[01:28:05.630 --> 01:28:08.390]  And the legal as we keep battling the globalists as they try to shut us down.

[01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:39.430]  I go to drjonesnaturals.com and I thank you for your support.
[01:28:41.029 --> 01:28:47.569]  Here's the last nine years of President Trump battling the deep state in a nutshell.
[01:28:48.069 --> 01:28:48.149]  Boom!
[01:29:35.289 --> 01:29:36.050]  Gandalf!
[01:29:36.050 --> 01:29:41.130]  I am the serpent of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Arnor.
[01:29:42.029 --> 01:29:46.109]  The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Uldund!
[01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:57.770]  Go back to the shadow!
[01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:33.409]  We're good to go.
[01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:50.390]  We're good to go.
[01:30:51.670 --> 01:30:52.710]  And understand the urgency.
[01:30:52.729 --> 01:30:53.550]  We will win.
[01:30:53.689 --> 01:30:58.789]  But that means you've got to keep the broadcast and organizations at the tip of the spear on air.
[01:30:58.989 --> 01:30:59.989]  You are the tip of the spear.
[01:31:00.449 --> 01:31:04.949]  Now, getting back to Chris DeLauro, getting back to Nate Hughes, getting back to Colin Sanders.
[01:31:05.170 --> 01:31:11.149]  You can find Nate at RallyNate, and you can find Colin Sanders at Colin J. Sanders on X as well.
[01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:13.010]  And we've got Chris here, the winner.
[01:31:13.329 --> 01:31:14.789]  We got cut off by the break.
[01:31:16.239 --> 01:31:17.340]  Chris, it's an interesting story.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:19.659]  So, how long have you been listening to the show?
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:23.260]  I don't know, but I think it was well pre-9-11.
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:25.939]  Somehow or another, I was listening to you pre-9-11.
[01:31:26.399 --> 01:31:29.899]  Or maybe I'm melding with David J. Smith.
[01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:32.359]  You were saying that's how you found me, was the David J. Smith book?
[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:32.859]  Yes.
[01:31:33.119 --> 01:31:34.819]  Well, no, his shortwave radio show.
[01:31:34.939 --> 01:31:41.119]  And then, I just, yeah, I never really tracked when I found you, but I know it's way early on, and then...
[01:31:42.510 --> 01:31:45.050]  Yeah, that's something the way my mind clicks.
[01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:46.310]  You have a photographic memory.
[01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:46.829]  Not anymore.
[01:31:47.689 --> 01:31:48.689]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:31:48.829 --> 01:31:49.130]  I bet you.
[01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:49.510]  Used to be.
[01:31:49.609 --> 01:31:49.989]  Used to be.
[01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:50.729]  No, no, no, no.
[01:31:51.010 --> 01:31:51.649]  Still decent.
[01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:57.069]  So, how has the world changed since you were in the Air Force?
[01:31:58.369 --> 01:32:03.449]  Well, it's gotten much more evil.
[01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:15.340]  Evildoers and seducers have waxed worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived out of 2 Timothy chapter 3. I think it's just, there's no comparison.
[01:32:15.819 --> 01:32:20.460]  I mean, one of the t-shirts I bought said, I miss the America I grew up in.
[01:32:20.779 --> 01:32:22.420]  And then the second one was prophetic.
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:25.340]  I said, I'm on a government watch list, which is happening today.
[01:32:27.449 --> 01:32:31.810]  I didn't want anything too aggressive that would get me punched randomly because I'm an old guy.
[01:32:32.670 --> 01:32:35.989]  But yeah, it's just changed in every way.
[01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:38.449]  The information war has ramped up.
[01:32:38.609 --> 01:32:41.970]  There's mass brainwashing, mass poisoning.
[01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:47.729]  People are just doing the craziest things.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.520]  People don't, they self-censor, too, people.
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.899]  They don't want the truth, generally speaking.
[01:32:54.119 --> 01:32:56.600]  And so, cast not your pearls among swine.
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:33:01.199]  At some point, you don't try to not, you try to get to people.
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:02.939]  What was that verse again?
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:03.539]  Because that's key.
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:05.279]  I remember reading that years ago in the Bible.
[01:33:06.199 --> 01:33:07.260]  Deceiving and being deceived.
[01:33:07.439 --> 01:33:15.579]  Oh, that's 2 Timothy chapter 3. The whole chapter is very short, but it's, yeah, this know also in the last days, perilous times shall come.
[01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:18.710]  For men shall be, you know, and it goes on.
[01:33:18.789 --> 01:33:19.689]  I could read it off my phone.
[01:33:19.810 --> 01:33:20.470]  All the terrible things.
[01:33:20.689 --> 01:33:21.270]  And it's happening.
[01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:22.189]  And it lists them.
[01:33:22.350 --> 01:33:31.930]  And then, so the verse was, you know, evildoers and seducers will wax, become, I mean, wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
[01:33:32.369 --> 01:33:33.369]  And so...
[01:33:33.369 --> 01:33:35.329]  That's the thing about people that get into evil...
[01:33:35.739 --> 01:33:36.760]  They deceive people.
[01:33:36.859 --> 01:33:37.680]  It's like a mind virus.
[01:33:37.859 --> 01:33:39.100]  They're then easy to deceive.
[01:33:39.319 --> 01:33:41.100]  Oh, they're all deceiving each other in the back.
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:45.140]  It was like there were three factions possibly working to remove Biden.
[01:33:45.359 --> 01:33:47.020]  They were all deceiving each other.
[01:33:47.199 --> 01:33:52.159]  At some point, it doesn't work out well for them.
[01:33:52.579 --> 01:33:53.939]  It gives you a headache.
[01:33:54.699 --> 01:33:55.760]  Yeah, it gives you a headache.
[01:33:56.539 --> 01:34:00.060]  When do we think the woke mine virus started taking over, in your opinion, Chris?
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:01.380]  In the Garden of Eden.
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:02.500]  Makes sense.
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:03.039]  Yeah.
[01:34:03.279 --> 01:34:04.180]  You're exactly right.
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:04.840]  Yeah.
[01:34:05.119 --> 01:34:05.560]  Wow.
[01:34:06.239 --> 01:34:07.380]  When were you in the Air Force?
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:14.100]  My last day was February 29th, 1996. So I gave him two weeks notice prior to that.
[01:34:14.239 --> 01:34:15.180]  That was my last flight.
[01:34:15.359 --> 01:34:16.239]  That was my Finney flight.
[01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:23.569]  I was down in Panama, and they forced me to go on a deployment, and it wasn't really technically legal.
[01:34:23.850 --> 01:34:34.750]  But anyway, I was working concurrently with the airline, and I had a couple little kids, and I was like, yeah, this is becoming too much, too big of a demand on my life.
[01:34:35.029 --> 01:34:38.369]  And so I let that go and stayed with the airline.
[01:34:38.609 --> 01:34:46.949]  Although now, I see friends that I don't know them anymore, but they became generals, and I'm like, Well, that was their thing.
[01:34:47.130 --> 01:34:48.550]  That's just the way it worked out.
[01:34:48.710 --> 01:34:50.170]  But that wasn't a bad career.
[01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:53.189]  I'm thinking that was probably my best job, although the airline was good.
[01:34:53.409 --> 01:35:08.710]  But the airline management, and I don't want to say anything because my son's an airline pilot for the same company, but say anything too diabolical, but they've kind of gone in the direction of Boeing where Boeing is just putting forth products before they're ready.
[01:35:09.250 --> 01:35:16.109]  Whereas, like I was saying, the 777, they would say to the engineers, just apparently, they would say, just make it perfect and let us know when you're done and take about seven years.
[01:35:16.649 --> 01:35:20.670]  And that all transpired back when Federico Pena, was he under Obama?
[01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:24.449]  He said, we'll not let another startup carrier fail.
[01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:25.869]  And so there was JetBlue.
[01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:32.449]  And they were an all-European fleet, subsidized by the EU. So they were pumping in European airplanes, undermining our economy.
[01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:36.069]  And they, from conception to production, were three and a half years, half the time of Boeing.
[01:35:36.869 --> 01:35:39.090]  And there were so many other things that went into it.
[01:35:39.250 --> 01:35:40.529]  So they undermined our economy.
[01:35:40.649 --> 01:35:41.649]  They undermined Boeing.
[01:35:42.609 --> 01:35:43.369]  Undermined our quality.
[01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:46.609]  Well, here's an example, a big article out today.
[01:35:47.789 --> 01:35:54.689]  There's a whole class of these really, obviously we now know, dangerous, untested drugs, and they're just flooding.
[01:35:54.789 --> 01:35:59.109]  Now they've got little kids on Ozempic on a bunch of drugs that shrink your heart and do all this stuff.
[01:35:59.229 --> 01:36:02.529]  And that's what Fauci said in like 2019 on C-SPAN. He said...
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.260]  We're going to blow up the old FDA system and just do whatever we want.
[01:36:06.579 --> 01:36:07.840]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:36:08.579 --> 01:36:10.640]  It's just build airplanes that don't work.
[01:36:10.779 --> 01:36:11.939]  Make drugs that kill.
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:13.319]  I mean, they just don't give a damn anymore.
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:16.319]  It's a green light to just run around screwing everybody.
[01:36:16.619 --> 01:36:22.739]  Who would want to be a powerful, rich person in a world where you screw everybody as if it doesn't blow back on you?
[01:36:22.819 --> 01:36:26.420]  And I look at different globalists statistically, and I know people that know them, and I'm...
[01:36:26.789 --> 01:36:28.949]  They have the highest rates of suicide in their kids.
[01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:30.729]  They're all super mentally ill.
[01:36:31.289 --> 01:36:33.970]  Almost all the globalists, like half their sons are trans.
[01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:37.869]  I mean, they, and like you said, they're on a bunch of drugs themselves.
[01:36:38.369 --> 01:36:40.470]  The elite is insane.
[01:36:40.930 --> 01:36:48.130]  Men of corrupt minds, that's in that 2 Timothy chapter 3. So a corrupt, if something becomes corrupted, it's irreversibly damaged, apparently.
[01:36:48.710 --> 01:36:52.149]  So I mean, they're men of corrupt minds that are making these decisions.
[01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:53.210]  So can they be redeemed?
[01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.810]  I don't know.
[01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:55.069]  I just deal with it.
[01:36:55.069 --> 01:36:58.670]  And evil people think if you don't do evil, squirrely, weird stuff, you're dumb.
[01:36:58.869 --> 01:37:00.090]  No, I understand the evil.
[01:37:00.539 --> 01:37:08.119]  And I love being straight up because the more you do it, your brain works faster and better because it's not thinking of squirrely stuff.
[01:37:08.199 --> 01:37:13.460]  It's going directly what's the most accurate, what's the most truthful, what's the most honorable, and then you get blessed.
[01:37:14.659 --> 01:37:15.100]  100%.
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:18.760]  It's just weird how these people think being evil is smart.
[01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:22.279]  I mean, if you're positive and you raise your vibes, right?
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:32.479]  If you're positive, if you give, you know, do daily affirmations, if you have the mindset of love, joy, respect, give honor, appreciation, you know, you lower that ego.
[01:37:32.819 --> 01:37:33.779]  I mean, good things come to you.
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:34.579]  Look at you, Chris.
[01:37:34.739 --> 01:37:35.699]  You're a great guy, right?
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:36.439]  Look what God's done.
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:38.579]  You weren't a DEI hire back in the day.
[01:37:38.659 --> 01:37:39.859]  I don't even think they did that then, right?
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:41.300]  It might have been.
[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:41.760]  I don't know.
[01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:46.920]  No, but God rewards those that diligently seek Him.
[01:37:47.079 --> 01:37:48.060]  And I was joking with these guys.
[01:37:48.159 --> 01:37:49.439]  I said, what does He reward them with?
[01:37:49.899 --> 01:37:50.380]  Trucks.
[01:37:50.659 --> 01:37:50.920]  No.
[01:37:51.319 --> 01:37:52.680]  No, but the truth.
[01:37:53.119 --> 01:37:55.939]  The truth is the greatest reward because what does it do?
[01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:56.899]  It sets you free.
[01:37:57.079 --> 01:37:58.819]  And you've achieved that freedom.
[01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:02.899]  You are, like, under such duress that it's unimaginable.
[01:38:03.579 --> 01:38:07.460]  But you just precisely continue to fight back.
[01:38:08.199 --> 01:38:14.180]  What's the Bible verses about God's, in the Psalms, God's prepared a place for me in the midst of my enemies?
[01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:17.050]  Oh, that's in the 23rd Psalm.
[01:38:17.289 --> 01:38:17.590]  Yes.
[01:38:17.869 --> 01:38:18.289]  He prepares.
[01:38:18.569 --> 01:38:18.789]  Yeah.
[01:38:19.729 --> 01:38:20.329]  23rd Psalm.
[01:38:20.409 --> 01:38:21.109]  And I read that now.
[01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:25.789]  It's like the widow's mite, too.
[01:38:25.890 --> 01:38:26.689]  And I get it.
[01:38:27.250 --> 01:38:29.029]  It's a real football game.
[01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:30.649]  It really matters.
[01:38:30.729 --> 01:38:31.409]  I'm like a football game.
[01:38:31.689 --> 01:38:35.710]  God always keeps it, though, like we're literally one point ahead.
[01:38:36.090 --> 01:38:38.569]  It's like God always is like, nope, I'm not going to make it easy.
[01:38:38.590 --> 01:38:39.630]  And now I can see why.
[01:38:39.829 --> 01:38:40.430]  But it's...
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:42.859]  Yeah, we become arrogant, I think.
[01:38:43.819 --> 01:38:46.239]  We're fallen creatures, and we've got to be careful.
[01:38:46.319 --> 01:38:47.279]  And I think complacent.
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:48.460]  Complacent, yeah.
[01:38:48.979 --> 01:38:56.140]  Because the attacks and the urgency, and just how evil these people are, has been my most valuable life lessons.
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:03.260]  It's literally, it's like taking a sword in the smith and beating it for six months to make a really powerful sword.
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:07.039]  It's hot, it's painful, but you're a sword at the end of it.
[01:39:07.730 --> 01:39:08.409]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:10.729]  I haven't actually done that, so I can't speak at that.
[01:39:10.930 --> 01:39:12.810]  Well, I mean, I have a blacksmith here, but I've read about it.
[01:39:13.069 --> 01:39:15.850]  My dad blacksmiths some of the hobby, but the point is, I'm just saying...
[01:39:15.850 --> 01:39:16.689]  Yeah, it's a great analogy.
[01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:17.029]  Yeah.
[01:39:17.369 --> 01:39:17.569]  Yeah.
[01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:19.329]  It's wild, though.
[01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:31.609]  So with your Air Force military background and all that, I mean, what do you make of the encroachment of NATO and Russia, Russia testing the ICBM and getting through the missile defenses, and then Lloyd Austin saying, oh, it's a bluff.
[01:39:32.029 --> 01:39:33.289]  They don't have any good weapons.
[01:39:34.119 --> 01:39:39.039]  Well, I think there's people that aren't suitable mentally for the positions they're in.
[01:39:41.219 --> 01:39:50.659]  I mean, thank God for men like Bigly, obviously you, and all the listeners, as you mentioned, that are fighting back.
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:40:00.260]  But, you know, there are people that aren't corrupt minds, but it seems like there's a weird human nature aspect that people gravitate to power that aren't quite stable.
[01:40:00.859 --> 01:40:06.739]  And then there are some good ones that gravitate, and they get attacked, and...
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:12.239]  But now, the question was, in the military, what did you ask me?
[01:40:12.319 --> 01:40:14.359]  What's your take on where we are militarily?
[01:40:14.699 --> 01:40:18.020]  I mean, I think hands down it's the most dangerous time in history where we are.
[01:40:18.239 --> 01:40:21.420]  I feel we're probably, I haven't studied that aspect.
[01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:24.699]  I'm not privy to what everything is and where they're located.
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:31.420]  But I think we're unprepared mentally and logistically.
[01:40:33.449 --> 01:40:39.750]  On a really frightful level, but it's God that will give us victory if he chooses.
[01:40:40.689 --> 01:40:41.470]  Well, exactly.
[01:40:41.649 --> 01:40:42.590]  I mean, there's no doubt.
[01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:48.789]  And I've studied all the military postures and the numbers.
[01:40:50.159 --> 01:40:53.880]  And there's lots of lying on both sides, both hiding stuff and then exaggerating stuff.
[01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:54.619]  Both goes on.
[01:40:54.739 --> 01:40:56.939]  But that's why it's mutually destroyed destruction.
[01:40:56.939 --> 01:41:00.680]  That's why there's, you know, a hundred times the nukes on both sides that are needed.
[01:41:01.039 --> 01:41:05.220]  Because even if half of them don't work or 80% get shot down, everybody's still dead.
[01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:10.619]  So it's just, that's why it's, I mean, we could destroy the earth over and over again, folks, by the late 60s.
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:14.520]  So people saying, oh, we can have a survivable nuclear war and stuff, they are full of it.
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:15.619]  And it's not just Russia.
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:20.340]  The minute Russia goes into nuclear war, their allies, China and others, it's total commitment.
[01:41:20.539 --> 01:41:22.939]  And then India and Pakistan start killing each other.
[01:41:23.039 --> 01:41:23.619]  It's not good.
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:24.159]  Yeah.
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:26.060]  Who's your guest there?
[01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:26.560]  You had a clip.
[01:41:26.819 --> 01:41:27.659]  72 hours.
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:29.340]  72 hellish hours.
[01:41:30.369 --> 01:41:30.989]  To have.
[01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:36.470]  And that's three days of just all hell breaking loose.
[01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:39.289]  But that describes fervent heat.
[01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:41.229]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:41:41.630 --> 01:41:43.289]  You know, Matthew 24 talks about the end of time.
[01:41:43.409 --> 01:41:45.909]  It also talks about Nineveh, and they got a hundred-year reprieve.
[01:41:45.989 --> 01:41:48.510]  So maybe, you know, what you're spearheading.
[01:41:48.569 --> 01:41:49.470]  You're the tip of the spear.
[01:41:50.130 --> 01:41:52.229]  Well, whatever God wants to do, God's going to do.
[01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:54.750]  But, you know, God tells us to, you know, be here and occupy.
[01:41:54.850 --> 01:41:56.569]  So I'm just going to do my job.
[01:41:56.649 --> 01:41:59.590]  And, yeah, I'm going to try to stop World War III. I really like living.
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:00.159]  Yeah.
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:12.319]  It's really frustrating to look at my children, and they're 22, 20, 16, and 7. But man, looking at the little one, it just pisses me off.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.199]  I'm just like, these people are crazy.
[01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:14.720]  Yeah.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:15.760]  I agree completely.
[01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:21.439]  And they're just ushering in their own servitude, slavery, whatever you want to call it.
[01:42:21.659 --> 01:42:25.159]  But oppression has been the order of the day throughout most of history.
[01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:29.600]  And the liberty that was created here in this country was amazing.
[01:42:30.630 --> 01:42:31.029]  Amazing.
[01:42:31.710 --> 01:42:32.989]  That's why we got to fight for it.
[01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:34.510]  We squandered it, of course.
[01:42:34.729 --> 01:42:45.869]  You know, if I had to say anything to the listeners, I would say, as just an average Arkansan who loves my country, loves God, I'm counterculture because I love my family, I love God, and I'll work my ass off, right?
[01:42:45.949 --> 01:42:47.289]  And I don't expect free things.
[01:42:47.810 --> 01:42:56.489]  But if you just step up locally, step up at your gym, step up to your barista, and just ask her if she likes not having her tips taxed.
[01:42:56.890 --> 01:43:02.710]  Or, you know, ask a guy in the sauna if he would be okay with me sitting next to his 12-year-old daughter.
[01:43:03.130 --> 01:43:13.850]  Start having these conversations that are brave, that, like you said, you're a little scared to speak up in New Jersey, but I would challenge you on the local level intimately to start just bringing things up that you agree with.
[01:43:14.069 --> 01:43:16.430]  You know, find, die on your shield inside.
[01:43:16.939 --> 01:43:18.899]  On your morals and live on them, right?
[01:43:19.199 --> 01:43:21.239]  So don't be scared to tell people about God.
[01:43:21.439 --> 01:43:23.340]  Don't be scared to tell them chicks don't have dicks.
[01:43:23.619 --> 01:43:24.579]  Proudly say it, right?
[01:43:25.079 --> 01:43:28.960]  If you know your truth, everyone listening, if you do that, it'll make a tide.
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:32.500]  It'll really start a change in this country from the ground up.
[01:43:32.659 --> 01:43:33.619]  Courage is contagious.
[01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:35.880]  Wear the hat, too.
[01:43:36.119 --> 01:43:39.199]  You wear the Trump hat, they will melt in front of you.
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:43.560]  You wear the Trump hat, and you can tell when someone doesn't like when you're wearing the hat, right?
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:44.180]  Whether it's the red hat.
[01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:45.100]  It's like truth serum.
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:45.579]  It is.
[01:43:46.119 --> 01:43:47.680]  Alex, you look at them in the eyes.
[01:43:48.239 --> 01:43:52.220]  And if you hold a little stare for a couple seconds, they immediately look down on that coward.
[01:43:52.399 --> 01:43:53.060]  Because they're cowards.
[01:43:53.119 --> 01:43:54.039]  Well, let me explain.
[01:43:54.199 --> 01:43:56.159]  Because I'm not saying, oh, I'm well-known.
[01:43:56.279 --> 01:43:59.779]  I mean, people that have an anemone need to wear the hat or a shirt if they want to experience it.
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:02.960]  Or we got other low-key shirts, like you said, that just meet black-minded patriots.
[01:44:03.060 --> 01:44:04.439]  It's kind of like choose your own adventure.
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:06.899]  But being Alex Jones, that's what happens.
[01:44:07.119 --> 01:44:09.699]  And I'll be walking down the, you know, hiking bike trail.
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:11.659]  And people are walking by a dog.
[01:44:11.739 --> 01:44:12.439]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:14.399]  Most people are, you know, that recognize me are listeners.
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:19.939]  So freedom is way more popular than it is negative, even in a place like Austin, supposedly deep blue.
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:24.899]  But when you see the lepers, they'll go, and then they'll look down like you said.
[01:44:25.399 --> 01:44:26.020]  Yeah, they will.
[01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:27.239]  It's the craziest thing.
[01:44:27.239 --> 01:44:29.199]  They used to say stuff, now they just look down.
[01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:30.020]  They're cowards.
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:32.420]  And all you have to do is look at them in the eye and say, how are you?
[01:44:32.619 --> 01:44:35.560]  Just kill them with kindness and love, which is what we believe, right?
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:36.840]  And truth.
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:40.640]  Sometimes they'll go, F you and your family, and I just go, are you on your 10th booster?
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:41.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:42.779]  Literally.
[01:44:43.859 --> 01:44:44.399]  That's funny.
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:48.239]  Yeah.
[01:45:01.539 --> 01:45:05.859]  I'm thankful for Robbie Starbuck for exposing a lot of that and getting these corporations to end that, right?
[01:45:06.039 --> 01:45:13.840]  But if you just stand up and draw a line in the sand and say, hey, I'm not taking it anymore, and be courageous, it's very contagious, and you can get other people to do the same thing.
[01:45:13.979 --> 01:45:15.619]  You can change the world and change the culture.
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:18.319]  And back to that.
[01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:25.789]  When they, World Net Daily, like 15 years ago, sued and got the Clinton papers.
[01:45:26.569 --> 01:45:39.369]  And in it, even before they're in office, when he's president-elect, they're like, we gotta shut down conservative and Christian and populist businesses and churches and magazines and newspapers and these guys that are making underground movies.
[01:45:39.770 --> 01:45:47.989]  Because this stuff is so popular already, if people ever figure out supporting conservative or populist or nationalist media, it will take over.
[01:45:48.090 --> 01:45:48.869]  Well, look, that happened.
[01:45:49.399 --> 01:45:54.659]  And so now we're actually in the dominant position only when it comes to actual viewers and listeners, the patriots.
[01:45:54.819 --> 01:45:59.600]  The globalists love all the money and the propaganda and a lot of the courts, but they're losing that.
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:06.060]  So when people shop with the AlexShoneStore.com or just mom and pops or local businesses, I mean, I think people...
[01:46:06.650 --> 01:46:11.130]  Should start sticking a Trump flag in their business and let the people that don't want to go there go there.
[01:46:11.289 --> 01:46:18.449]  I bet you in almost even blue areas you'll get more business because the Trump supporters are the majority and they want to support.
[01:46:18.649 --> 01:46:21.770]  So I like it when leftists say no Trump people in this business.
[01:46:21.949 --> 01:46:24.430]  I mean, I wish they would all do that so I can stay away from them.
[01:46:24.850 --> 01:46:25.170]  100%.
[01:46:25.170 --> 01:46:35.029]  There's a local butcher shop back home in Fayetteville where I get, you know, whether it's, we usually buy a cow, but if it's chicken or something else, I go in there and I go in there and I'll wear my red MAGA hat and I get a lot of compliments.
[01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:36.050]  So it's like, well, you know what?
[01:46:36.250 --> 01:46:37.569]  I'm not shopping at Walmart anymore.
[01:46:37.569 --> 01:46:38.729]  I'm not shopping at Whole Foods.
[01:46:38.869 --> 01:46:40.630]  I'm not shopping at any of the other chains, right?
[01:46:40.689 --> 01:46:42.069]  I'm going to support my local business.
[01:46:42.189 --> 01:46:51.310]  If you support local businesses, small business in general, whether it's the Alex Jones store, whether it's, you know, the local meat market, whatever it is, if you support local and support people that support you.
[01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:52.649]  And then it grows that market.
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:53.840]  It lowers the prices.
[01:46:54.119 --> 01:46:57.819]  You grow that ecosystem of like-minded people and like-minded businesses.
[01:46:57.859 --> 01:47:07.039]  And I know most listeners get that, but I wanted to really sink in that the first mission of the Clintons was, they did it with the IRS and stuff, don't let the people have their own ecosystem.
[01:47:07.579 --> 01:47:08.260]  Look at us.
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:09.000]  We're winning.
[01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:10.380]  We're winning the culture war.
[01:47:10.539 --> 01:47:13.279]  You have NFL players doing the Trump, right?
[01:47:13.399 --> 01:47:14.399]  When's the last time that happened?
[01:47:14.479 --> 01:47:23.859]  Oh, they thought in their own congressional hearings and stuff eight years ago, They said if we can shut Alex Jones down, because I was one of the only people at this level doing this, we'll beat them.
[01:47:24.039 --> 01:47:25.840]  Now it's Elon Musk and Joe Rogan.
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:27.579]  How crazy!
[01:47:27.819 --> 01:47:31.199]  It's really God is what it is now, and it's too big for them to shut down.
[01:47:31.319 --> 01:47:35.579]  And that's why, you know, with this election, the mainstream media died, and so did the deep state.
[01:47:35.739 --> 01:47:38.319]  It might take some slow bleeding out, but we're winning.
[01:47:38.319 --> 01:47:42.680]  So stay brave, stay courageous, and more than anything, live a fact-based life, right?
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:44.340]  Call things out for reality.
[01:47:44.539 --> 01:47:44.920]  Don't get...
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:48.680]  Overtaken by the woke mind virus and just be based.
[01:47:48.859 --> 01:47:51.119]  God is real, right?
[01:47:51.239 --> 01:47:55.319]  You can't go outside and look at the sunshine and tell me there's not a God out there, right?
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:00.880]  So live a fact-based life, feel courageous to do that, and the world will change for the good.
[01:48:01.529 --> 01:48:15.229]  And I think Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Elon Musk need to stand behind you and point out more on a daily basis what has happened to you, the persecution, the lawfare, and just to be more supportive of you.
[01:48:15.310 --> 01:48:19.829]  I know they support you, but- Yeah, I mean, I was talking to- Joe reached out last night.
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:22.260]  Actually, I missed his text days ago.
[01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:23.380]  Oh, sorry to see your text.
[01:48:23.479 --> 01:48:24.680]  He said, is it true?
[01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:27.119]  They grabbed your building and now you're back in?
[01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:27.760]  I sent him the articles.
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:28.739]  He said, this is insane.
[01:48:28.899 --> 01:48:30.079]  So he's going to cover it.
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:31.819]  But yeah, Tucker's...
[01:48:31.819 --> 01:48:34.760]  I talked to Tucker quite a bit, but lately I haven't because we've all been so busy.
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:37.960]  If this was happening to them, I'd definitely be talking about it.
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:38.920]  But it's kind of like...
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:39.779]  It's also a paradox.
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:41.359]  People are so used to me being under attack.
[01:48:43.010 --> 01:48:45.930]  I mean, you know, now Trump would have to dodge five bullets for people to carry.
[01:48:46.010 --> 01:48:47.250]  It's like we've been through so much.
[01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:48.949]  He goes, well, you know, those guys will always be there.
[01:48:49.250 --> 01:48:50.590]  No, we won't if you don't support us.
[01:48:52.279 --> 01:48:56.079]  Who is the guy that wrote Nobody Died at SH? I don't even want to say the name, that's a hot potato.
[01:48:56.359 --> 01:48:57.279]  Was it James Fetzer?
[01:48:57.439 --> 01:48:57.600]  Yeah.
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:03.579]  Yeah, so I Googled his name years ago, and there was a phone number I called, he answered, he was quite gracious, and we spoke at length.
[01:49:03.739 --> 01:49:05.000]  He said his book is banned.
[01:49:05.319 --> 01:49:05.760]  It is.
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:06.079]  Oh.
[01:49:06.479 --> 01:49:06.779]  Crazy.
[01:49:07.159 --> 01:49:10.500]  Yeah, and they're the guys that questioned it, the internet, when it was a huge controversy.
[01:49:10.699 --> 01:49:12.180]  I just covered it a few times.
[01:49:12.979 --> 01:49:14.680]  Yeah, what does that tell you when it's banned?
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:15.220]  Exactly.
[01:49:15.479 --> 01:49:23.720]  They hired PR firms to just make up all the stuff I didn't do to raise money for the National Violence Policy Center, Brady Group.
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:25.420]  Now, Everytown's the new name.
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:32.819]  So they've raised money off my name, claimed I raised money off their name, then sued me, rigged the court cases, did all this, and now I'm suing their ass.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:33.199]  Good.
[01:49:33.590 --> 01:49:40.949]  What's even crazier is after, I guess, last week, whenever The Onion was, they were so courageously going on mainstream, which who gives a flying fuck?
[01:49:41.090 --> 01:49:45.710]  They got about half a million views, probably cumulative, and were so proud of just canceling you.
[01:49:45.810 --> 01:49:47.069]  It wasn't for anything else.
[01:49:47.329 --> 01:49:52.590]  And that was, again, I'm just an average American who loves my family and loves God and loves freedom, right?
[01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:54.069]  It was very, very shocking.
[01:49:54.649 --> 01:49:55.850]  Imagine how they feel now.
[01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:56.569]  Yeah, right.
[01:49:56.970 --> 01:49:58.270]  Oh, you bought it, huh?
[01:49:59.750 --> 01:50:00.190]  See?
[01:50:00.190 --> 01:50:02.149]  You bought it, but Alex is still on air.
[01:50:02.710 --> 01:50:03.229]  And mocked you after.
[01:50:03.229 --> 01:50:06.289]  My lawyers are top lawyers, and they said they'd ever want to say a sure thing.
[01:50:06.569 --> 01:50:08.149]  They've never seen something this ridiculous.
[01:50:08.369 --> 01:50:15.390]  So when there's finally the evidentiary hearing, I mean, we put these lawsuits that this is criminal.
[01:50:15.729 --> 01:50:18.489]  And we show the U.S. it's cut and dry criminal.
[01:50:19.170 --> 01:50:20.210]  Yeah, it is criminal.
[01:50:21.189 --> 01:50:25.029]  It's like they didn't want the money, even though they, you know, you had the billion dollar judgment, right?
[01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.890]  But they didn't want the money.
[01:50:25.970 --> 01:50:26.949]  They just want you shut down.
[01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:28.029]  That's bullshit, right?
[01:50:28.270 --> 01:50:30.689]  And we tried to settle with them.
[01:50:30.729 --> 01:50:32.090]  They said, we don't want money.
[01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.489]  Yeah.
[01:50:32.970 --> 01:50:35.710]  So it was, and I just wanted to get, but of course they never were.
[01:50:35.770 --> 01:50:36.310]  So here's the deal.
[01:50:36.449 --> 01:50:39.750]  It's T-A-S. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:50:40.949 --> 01:50:42.529]  ADS, Alex Derangement Syndrome.
[01:50:42.729 --> 01:50:43.970]  Yeah, it is.
[01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:46.029]  Well, what it is, they hate God.
[01:50:46.270 --> 01:50:47.489]  They hate anybody that's standing up for God.
[01:50:47.670 --> 01:50:52.930]  So, again, I'm going to come back, open the phones up, cover all the news, recap breaking stuff.
[01:50:53.170 --> 01:50:54.390]  Isn't it great news that Trump...
[01:50:56.810 --> 01:51:02.810]  We're good to go.
[01:51:15.119 --> 01:51:17.279]  You want to get Ultimate Sea Moss.
[01:51:17.439 --> 01:51:20.220]  It really is the ultimate superfood.
[01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:22.039]  We take an hour to describe it all.
[01:51:22.359 --> 01:51:24.880]  Just take it for a few days and see what you feel like.
[01:51:24.939 --> 01:51:25.920]  Take it for a few weeks.
[01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:27.100]  I mean, I am...
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:31.220]  I always take some of the supplements, but now I'm taking them all.
[01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:34.159]  But I'm telling you, the CMOS is insane.
[01:51:34.619 --> 01:51:36.319]  I already knew it was a superfood.
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:40.420]  They came to me and said, what about CMOS? I looked it up, and I said, yeah, just get the best source of it.
[01:51:40.479 --> 01:51:40.979]  They said, we already do.
[01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:41.539]  What do you think of this company?
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:45.840]  They said, oh my God, that's the top rated, like 4.9 stars, so you put your name on it.
[01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:47.899]  And it's just incredible.
[01:51:48.119 --> 01:51:55.460]  Everybody, for your energy, stamina, libido, immune system, focus, your eyes, your cardiovascular, your blood sugar.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.159]  I mean, this stuff is amazing.
[01:51:58.239 --> 01:52:04.420]  And it's the concentrate of the CMOS and several other amazing natural compounds that are also known to do incredible stuff.
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:05.539]  It is strong.
[01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:07.000]  Support us.
[01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:08.260]  Try it out.
[01:52:09.069 --> 01:52:16.630]  Go get the Ultimate CMOS. Get one of the fundraiser posters that has big markup in it, because the other products don't, where we actually get some real money.
[01:52:16.689 --> 01:52:23.850]  And if you really want to help us, get some of the collectible limited edition posters all at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:52:23.890 --> 01:52:29.189]  But we've got the winner of the first big offering, and we're very excited to have him here with us.
[01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:30.869]  And we've got a new truck.
[01:52:30.930 --> 01:52:33.250]  Everybody that spends any money in the store gets entered to win.
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:48.760]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, InfoWars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:54.300]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public, and people can just put in one bid.
[01:52:55.090 --> 01:52:58.170]  And then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[01:52:58.689 --> 01:53:02.529]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might tell you tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[01:53:02.689 --> 01:53:03.189]  Who knows?
[01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:06.149]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[01:53:06.430 --> 01:53:12.270]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved, filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty.
[01:53:12.979 --> 01:53:20.800]  Having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and when they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[01:53:21.079 --> 01:53:25.220]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at InfoWars.
[01:53:25.359 --> 01:53:39.619]  But regardless, our great sponsors at TheAlexSchoneStore.com With incredible supplements and amazing Patriot gear have been helping us continue to stay on air and prepare to launch the Alex Jones Network where we won't miss a beat.
[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:54.380]  If you remember when they first came on three months ago as a sponsor, they launched that incredible Super Dodge pickup giveaway sweepstakes where every time you buy something at thealexjonesstore.com, you get entered to win the raffle for the truck.
[01:53:54.789 --> 01:53:58.590]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in.
[01:53:58.670 --> 01:53:59.930]  But that's going to get announced.
[01:54:00.069 --> 01:54:02.149]  The winner here in just a few days.
[01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:06.329]  And regardless of whether InfoWars is on the air or not, the Alex Jones Network will be on air.
[01:54:06.430 --> 01:54:07.970]  And so you'll see the winner of the announcement.
[01:54:07.970 --> 01:54:09.829]  We're going to invite them to Austin and so much more.
[01:54:10.029 --> 01:54:10.909]  So now...
[01:54:11.310 --> 01:54:19.010]  We were going to do this in a few weeks, but now our great sponsor is doing it early because we're calling it the darkest hour giveaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:19.369 --> 01:54:24.890]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[01:54:25.090 --> 01:54:26.369]  I'll read over the specs in a moment.
[01:54:26.529 --> 01:54:27.510]  It's a beautiful truck.
[01:54:28.090 --> 01:54:33.430]  Super high ratings, and you get $10,000 in cash on top of it for the lucky winner.
[01:54:33.609 --> 01:54:36.390]  And there's so much more at TheAlexJonesStore.com.

[01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:18.800]  And here is the amazing new offer.
[01:55:18.979 --> 01:55:23.340]  I knew folks would love the last truck, and I know you'll love this truck as well.
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:28.600]  Well, because I love it, and it turns out the listeners are just like me, badass folks, pure Americana.

[01:56:21.890 --> 01:56:27.289]  Now we've got to stay on air to back his agenda to make America great again and go after the deep state globalists.
[01:56:27.529 --> 01:56:28.470]  God bless you all.
[01:56:28.670 --> 01:56:29.609]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:56:29.829 --> 01:56:32.689]  Check out the new truck at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:56:33.439 --> 01:56:36.920]  Well, the winner, Chris DiLaro, is here in studio from New Jersey.
[01:56:37.079 --> 01:56:40.800]  Former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:41.960]  What an amazing aircraft.
[01:56:42.359 --> 01:56:44.960]  And then now it's all pure crap on purpose because the globalists don't care.
[01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:45.960]  They're sabotaging civilization.
[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:48.000]  Closing comments from all you guys.
[01:56:48.079 --> 01:56:49.579]  And Chris, I gotta say, man, we love you.
[01:56:49.659 --> 01:56:50.399]  Thanks for the support.
[01:56:51.109 --> 01:56:51.930]  I love you, Alex.
[01:56:52.109 --> 01:56:54.189]  I love Bigley, Nate, Colin.
[01:56:54.430 --> 01:56:54.829]  Thanks, Chris.
[01:56:55.050 --> 01:57:00.010]  This is one of the pinnacles in my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there, just being in this studio.
[01:57:00.010 --> 01:57:01.170]  I never imagined I'd be.
[01:57:01.170 --> 01:57:02.149]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.850]  You're the reason we're here.
[01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:05.409]  It's so cool how cool the listeners are.
[01:57:05.489 --> 01:57:05.890]  It is.
[01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.350]  Yes.
[01:57:06.529 --> 01:57:07.050]  Wow, thank you.
[01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:09.640]  Yeah, the listeners are amazing.
[01:57:09.859 --> 01:57:15.619]  Like, everyone that goes to the Alex Jones store, obviously you're in it to win this truck, but this experience of coming on the show, how is this, Chris?
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:19.479]  I mean, is this not, this is like a, it's a dream, I would feel like, for the winner, right?
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:30.899]  Fortunately, I slept pretty good last night, but it's been very stressful because he said, Colin said, you're going on the show, and I was like, I'm a little camera shy, but here I am.
[01:57:31.039 --> 01:57:32.220]  And I've done well, Lord Vader.
[01:57:33.210 --> 01:57:35.590]  I said, I'll do whatever I need to do to help Alex and Big Lee.
[01:57:35.989 --> 01:57:37.409]  Well, I'm glad I got to meet you.
[01:57:37.449 --> 01:57:39.270]  We're going to eat some barbecue from Terry Black's here in a minute.
[01:57:39.609 --> 01:57:40.989]  I started to mouthwater when you said that.
[01:57:41.130 --> 01:57:41.590]  Oh, I'm starving.
[01:57:41.710 --> 01:57:45.710]  Now, real quick, this is all done by a computer, by a professional company.
[01:57:45.930 --> 01:57:47.050]  I was talking to you guys before.
[01:57:47.609 --> 01:57:48.949]  Sometimes it's in the middle of it.
[01:57:48.989 --> 01:57:49.810]  Sometimes it's at the end.
[01:57:49.890 --> 01:57:50.789]  Sometimes it's at the start.
[01:57:51.550 --> 01:57:53.989]  Have you seen where somebody who entered on the first day won?
[01:57:54.279 --> 01:57:59.960]  You know, honestly, we've done probably 30 of these giveaways and have never seen someone win on the very first day.
[01:58:00.159 --> 01:58:05.800]  But we have these multipliers that go into place maybe at the first week and the last week of the giveaway, right?
[01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:09.119]  And during these multipliers, if you spend $10, you get 100 entries.
[01:58:09.199 --> 01:58:11.199]  If you spend $100, you get 1,000 entries, right?
[01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:13.899]  It's a 10X multiplier for when you enter during that time period.
[01:58:14.039 --> 01:58:16.739]  You actually enter during the 10X time period, right?
[01:58:17.039 --> 01:58:19.720]  And at the end of the giveaway, we run the 10X time period as well.
[01:58:19.859 --> 01:58:22.239]  So it was one of the best times to enter to win.
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:23.659]  And, I mean, you got...
[01:58:23.699 --> 01:58:25.319]  More entries for how much you spend.
[01:58:25.340 --> 01:58:26.859]  With the new contest, where are we right now?
[01:58:27.239 --> 01:58:29.699]  So we are launching...
[01:58:29.699 --> 01:58:30.699]  It's live now.
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:31.859]  You launched two hours ago?
[01:58:32.260 --> 01:58:35.859]  I don't know what time we launched, but can I tell them what it is?
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:36.199]  Yeah.
[01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:39.680]  It's a brand new Ford F-250 Super Duty trimmer.
[01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:40.279]  It's sick.
[01:58:40.439 --> 01:58:44.260]  It's all black, jacked up, 37-inch tires, 20-inch rims.
[01:58:44.340 --> 01:58:45.100]  I mean, it's fire.
[01:58:45.479 --> 01:58:46.920]  Okay, so this just launched today.
[01:58:48.140 --> 01:58:49.399]  Yeah, it's live right now.
[01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:49.920]  I know that.
[01:58:50.079 --> 01:58:51.520]  If you go to the Alex Jones store right now...
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:52.140]  We gotta coordinate more.
[01:58:52.220 --> 01:58:52.899]  I didn't even know that.
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:53.840]  I've been on the air for like a week.
[01:58:53.979 --> 01:58:55.079]  The new deal's up there.
[01:58:55.399 --> 01:58:56.600]  I did want to speak to you, Sid.
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:58:58.960]  I hope y'all got the banners uploaded on the site, guys.
[01:58:59.119 --> 01:59:01.060]  Yeah, that's why I was like, can I talk about it?
[01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:01.819]  I was looking through.
[01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:04.619]  But no, right now, the F-250 is live.
[01:59:04.779 --> 01:59:07.960]  It's a brand new 2024 Ford F-250 Super Duty.
[01:59:08.819 --> 01:59:10.659]  It's Alex Jones verified for sure.
[01:59:10.939 --> 01:59:11.880]  He picked the wheels.
[01:59:12.020 --> 01:59:12.739]  He picked the tires.
[01:59:13.039 --> 01:59:13.779]  It looks good.
[01:59:13.899 --> 01:59:14.159]  I don't know.
[01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:15.260]  Yeah, we're showing it right here.
[01:59:15.619 --> 01:59:18.159]  It also comes with $10,000 in cash as well.
[01:59:18.359 --> 01:59:19.159]  Chris, do you have that on you?
[01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:21.319]  Well, I might have a little something here.
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:22.279]  Oh, okay.
[01:59:24.199 --> 01:59:25.239]  There's my zipper pocket.
[01:59:25.479 --> 01:59:27.899]  Okay, so yeah, this is not a hoax, people.
[01:59:28.619 --> 01:59:31.479]  That is, I haven't counted them yet.
[01:59:31.539 --> 01:59:32.779]  I'm gonna mug him, I'm taking it back.
[01:59:34.399 --> 01:59:35.359]  Thanks for the donation.
[01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:37.060]  I would probably just give it to you Alex.
[01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:37.560]  Don't do that.
[01:59:37.579 --> 01:59:38.020]  I'm joking.
[01:59:38.140 --> 01:59:38.739]  I'm joking.
[01:59:39.039 --> 01:59:39.579]  I know, I know.
[01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:40.300]  It's a joke.
[01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:41.960]  Man, this is exciting.
[01:59:42.319 --> 01:59:45.680]  All right, well then, we need to coordinate because I'm so busy fighting the New World Order.
[01:59:45.819 --> 01:59:48.300]  I wasn't sure when we were launching it.
[01:59:48.739 --> 01:59:49.800]  I think I misspoke.
[01:59:50.029 --> 01:59:50.970]  No, I think it is launched.
[01:59:51.130 --> 01:59:51.909]  No, it is launched.
[01:59:51.989 --> 01:59:52.710]  It's 100% launched.
[01:59:52.850 --> 01:59:56.770]  We launched it actually on Wednesday, but I think we put the winner announcement up today.
[01:59:56.890 --> 01:59:57.989]  Something on the site changed today.
[01:59:58.109 --> 02:00:00.750]  But yeah, anyone who's ordered in the past couple days, you are entered into the F-250.
[02:00:00.850 --> 02:00:01.689]  So I misspoke on that.
[02:00:01.710 --> 02:00:02.029]  I apologize.
[02:00:02.050 --> 02:00:02.430]  That's okay.
[02:00:02.829 --> 02:00:03.590]  We're live, man.
[02:00:03.670 --> 02:00:04.310]  We're live, baby.
[02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.789]  We're live.
[02:00:04.930 --> 02:00:05.930]  It's teleprompter free.
[02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:06.319]  Yep.
[02:00:06.460 --> 02:00:07.420]  Somebody can be like Chris.
[02:00:07.560 --> 02:00:09.079]  They can go to the AlexJonesStore.com.
[02:00:09.159 --> 02:00:12.359]  They can order the great CMOS, order any of the great supplements, T-shirts, hats, whatever.
[02:00:12.539 --> 02:00:18.500]  And you're entered to win a badass, brand new F-250 trimmer, fully loaded pickup truck.
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:19.880]  And you get $10,000 in cash.
[02:00:19.939 --> 02:00:21.159]  And we fly you down here.
[02:00:21.300 --> 02:00:22.119]  You get to meet Alex.
[02:00:22.119 --> 02:00:22.920]  You get to be on the show.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.659]  And you get to eat a really badass short rib from Terry Black's Barbecue.
[02:00:26.659 --> 02:00:27.359]  That's exactly right.
[02:00:27.359 --> 02:00:28.060]  Please stop talking.
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:30.039]  And one thing we don't talk about is...
[02:00:30.039 --> 02:00:31.260]  Beef ribs are even better.
[02:00:31.359 --> 02:00:32.340]  Beef ribs, 100%.
[02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:33.640]  I might get a whole damn slab.
[02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:34.640]  What we forget the time.
[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:35.159]  I'm going to eat...
[02:00:35.310 --> 02:00:36.689]  Like Fred Flintstone, eat that with you.
[02:00:36.810 --> 02:00:37.550]  Let's do it.
[02:00:37.710 --> 02:00:38.149]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:38.750]  No, you're good.
[02:00:38.829 --> 02:00:42.609]  We just forget to tell people, too, if you just enter your email, you're still entered to win.
[02:00:42.729 --> 02:00:48.770]  And then every time Alex drops a video, when the onion fails miserably again, you'll be the first people to hear about it.
[02:00:48.909 --> 02:00:52.729]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com, enter your email, join the VIP club.
[02:00:52.729 --> 02:00:56.090]  I promise you next week what you'll get for being in the VIP club.
[02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:57.350]  You'll be very excited.
[02:00:57.630 --> 02:00:59.270]  And everybody that entered won.
[02:00:59.850 --> 02:01:01.670]  All right, David DeLauro, thank you so much.
[02:01:01.810 --> 02:01:07.909]  Nate Hughes, Colin Sanders, TheAlexShowStore.com, forward slash VIP. You get $40 a month to spend in there for $30 a month.
[02:01:08.050 --> 02:01:08.810]  We'll be right back.
[02:01:09.029 --> 02:01:10.729]  It's like, what is it, citizen journalist?
[02:01:10.829 --> 02:01:11.850]  How did Elon Musk put it?
[02:01:11.909 --> 02:01:13.329]  It's like, you are now the journalist.
[02:01:13.869 --> 02:01:15.310]  I'm misquoting him.
[02:01:15.449 --> 02:01:17.270]  X is mainstream media now.
[02:01:17.369 --> 02:01:18.409]  That is the mainstream media.
[02:01:18.409 --> 02:01:20.010]  That's where most people are getting their news now.
[02:01:20.189 --> 02:01:22.289]  The views speak for itself, you know?
[02:01:22.449 --> 02:01:24.750]  It's not just the views, it's the community notes.
[02:01:24.909 --> 02:01:27.069]  The fact that you can actually fact check these things.
[02:01:27.369 --> 02:01:35.350]  And then you have all these brilliant people that are participating in this live debate in real time online about what's real and what's not.
[02:01:35.569 --> 02:01:43.989]  And you're finding, specifically when they found the Twitter files, they're like, Jesus Christ, the FBI is involved in this?
[02:01:44.090 --> 02:01:45.909]  Like, what the is going on?
[02:01:46.050 --> 02:01:46.310]  Yeah.
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:47.920]  This is so crazy.
[02:01:48.039 --> 02:01:51.479]  The FBI is involved in deciding what's real and what's not on Twitter.
[02:01:52.479 --> 02:01:53.039]  Unreal.
[02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:55.859]  And you're banning journalists.
[02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:57.899]  You're banning scientists.
[02:01:58.119 --> 02:01:59.520]  This is really crazy.
[02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:01.739]  Yeah, and it's bad for society.
[02:02:02.039 --> 02:02:02.600]  It's terrible.
[02:02:02.899 --> 02:02:05.039]  It's caused irreparable harm with misinformation.
[02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:05.619]  But it's not.
[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:07.779]  So it's bad initially.
[02:02:08.039 --> 02:02:09.619]  But then ultimately it's good.
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:13.720]  Because ultimately, we learn who you can and can't trust.
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:16.060]  And you say, well, who's just honest and accurate?
[02:02:16.239 --> 02:02:18.239]  Because there's a lot of money in being honest and accurate.
[02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:18.619]  Yeah.
[02:02:19.039 --> 02:02:20.119]  You know, this is what's crazy.
[02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:22.619]  Like, all these independent journalists are doing really well.
[02:02:22.779 --> 02:02:26.840]  Well, because they don't have a giant building in Atlanta that's filled with a thousand workers.
[02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:27.359]  Right?
[02:02:27.539 --> 02:02:30.420]  So they don't have the overhead for terrible ratings.
[02:02:30.979 --> 02:02:33.079]  Terrible ratings and a massive overhead.
[02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:34.300]  Like, you're kind of...
[02:02:34.359 --> 02:02:46.199]  So it's great for us that it leads to the rise of these guys like Matt Taibbi that used to be a part of the system and now are independent, Glenn Greenwald, all these type of people, Michael Schellenberger, people that you can actually trust.
[02:02:46.340 --> 02:02:49.279]  They're going to tell you the truth because there's actually money in telling the truth.
[02:02:50.050 --> 02:02:50.329]  Yep.
[02:02:50.489 --> 02:02:51.750]  It's a great business model.
[02:02:51.970 --> 02:02:57.869]  It's course corrected, and you're proof of it, and all these other people, you know, whether it's Tucker Carlson and many, many others.
[02:02:58.489 --> 02:02:58.670]  Proof of it.
[02:02:58.689 --> 02:02:58.829]  Yep.
[02:02:59.369 --> 02:02:59.609]  You know?
[02:03:00.449 --> 02:03:09.989]  There is a course correction, and the problem is they've dug their heels in so much, and they'll write articles like that New York Times article that are so crazy.
[02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:10.949]  They updated it.
[02:03:11.189 --> 02:03:11.970]  Oh, congratulations.
[02:04:08.570 --> 02:04:10.550]  Here's the facts in 60 seconds.
[02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:15.689]  The Justice Department came into my bankruptcy, has tried to shut us down twice since May.
[02:04:15.989 --> 02:04:17.529]  The latest case was last week.
[02:04:17.689 --> 02:04:18.869]  The judge shut them down.
[02:04:19.029 --> 02:04:19.930]  They were thrown out of the building.
[02:04:20.090 --> 02:04:20.829]  Crimes were committed.
[02:04:21.010 --> 02:04:22.710]  It's very clear they're in a lot of trouble.
[02:04:22.949 --> 02:04:25.409]  I've filed counter lawsuits, you name it.
[02:04:25.470 --> 02:04:33.670]  If what Alex Jones describes is correct, Steve, that there were other bidders, maybe led by Roger Stone, and he's a hero for putting them together.
[02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:36.729]  to try to rescue Infowars.
[02:04:36.909 --> 02:04:43.550]  And if they had the highest bid and that was ignored, you know, that's a serious legal issue that will need to be examined.
[02:04:43.829 --> 02:04:45.229]  Infowarsstore.com is in limbo.
[02:04:45.390 --> 02:04:46.989]  If you order there, you'll get your products.
[02:04:47.430 --> 02:05:00.949]  But thealexjonesstore.com is our great sponsors in Arkansas with T-shirts and great supplements that are funding not just Infowars but the Alex Jones Network in case this gets shut down in another hearing next week.
[02:05:01.270 --> 02:05:04.939]  So, a lot of people Aren't going to thealexjonesstore.com right now.
[02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:07.619]  We're getting messages, oh, we don't want to give money to The Onion.
[02:05:07.819 --> 02:05:13.319]  The Onion didn't get Infowars, and they don't own Alex Jones, and they don't own the Alex Jones Network.
[02:05:13.479 --> 02:05:14.359]  I don't even own that.
[02:05:14.439 --> 02:05:15.180]  It's the sponsor.
[02:05:15.699 --> 02:05:27.369]  So again, when you go there and get great Trump gear, Alex Jones gear, Patriot gear, incredible supplements like Ultimate CMOS, collectible posters, incredible designer knives, and more at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:31.630]  You are keeping me on the air one way or another, and we need the funds.
[02:05:31.789 --> 02:05:36.329]  Over the weekend, folks, we saw our funds cut in half, and people told us, well, we don't want to give it to The Onion.
[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:38.220]  The Onion does not own me.
[02:05:38.359 --> 02:05:41.659]  They do not own the alexjonesstore.com.
[02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:43.380]  So thanks for your past support.

[02:06:12.069 --> 02:06:13.689]  It's not owned by the Easter Bunny.
[02:06:13.869 --> 02:06:21.689]  It's owned by great patriots in Arkansas with their own factories, making their own knives, t-shirts, and then private labeling top supplements and selling them to you.
[02:06:22.029 --> 02:06:23.909]  It's the alexjonesstore.com.
[02:06:24.010 --> 02:06:26.090]  It's the future one way or another.

[02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:39.960]  We're fighting hard.
[02:06:40.140 --> 02:06:41.000]  We're winning.
[02:06:41.119 --> 02:06:42.779]  But the fight is close.
[02:06:42.779 --> 02:06:48.239]  So we need your prayer, your word of mouth, and your support right now at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:06:59.689 --> 02:07:06.329]  Alright, we've got an hour and 48 minutes left in broadcast time.
[02:07:06.930 --> 02:07:10.909]  I want to go over a bunch of news right now.
[02:07:11.649 --> 02:07:12.550]  There's a lot of it.
[02:07:12.609 --> 02:07:13.329]  It's very important.
[02:07:14.609 --> 02:07:16.510]  But I also want to take your calls.
[02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:21.890]  So I'm going to give the number out, and I'm going to do it for first-time callers again.
[02:07:22.890 --> 02:07:27.390]  And you are welcome to bring up any topic, any subject, any issue, any question.
[02:07:27.390 --> 02:07:28.609]  You disagree, you agree.
[02:07:28.869 --> 02:07:31.350]  We don't screen your calls except for two things.
[02:07:33.289 --> 02:07:40.369]  That you have a good connection and that you are able to talk generally.
[02:07:41.250 --> 02:07:49.569]  Then sometimes, as you know, I will say, I'd like to get your take on this subject.
[02:07:50.899 --> 02:07:52.680]  But I don't do that most of the time.
[02:07:53.359 --> 02:07:58.000]  Now, usually the subjects I raise when I do ask for that, and I'm saying you can bring up whatever you want.
[02:07:58.640 --> 02:08:09.859]  But I think World War III and trying to get Trump into office in 57 days, or 56 days, and all the craziness going on, I mean, that topic affects everything.
[02:08:09.979 --> 02:08:14.560]  And I do want to ask listeners, because, I mean, I don't just say that to have engagement.
[02:08:15.659 --> 02:08:18.340]  People ask questions on X because they just want to get engagement.
[02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:25.460]  No, when I ask a question, it's because I'm really pondering something and I get a lot of really good insights and thoughts from you.
[02:08:27.180 --> 02:08:34.180]  And so, clearly, the globalists, a large portion of their factions, know Trump is about to get a major peace deal.
[02:08:34.319 --> 02:08:38.460]  I'm predicting he will at least get Putin to propose one soon.
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:41.760]  And I know that he's doing that behind the scenes.
[02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:43.119]  And the head of NATO is there today.
[02:08:43.239 --> 02:08:48.100]  And I told you yesterday, there's a secret peace summit going on at Mar-a-Lago, and world leaders are going to start going there.
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:51.199]  Now, obviously, with Zelensky and Putin, that's being done remotely.
[02:08:51.779 --> 02:08:53.060]  And now that broke today.
[02:08:53.380 --> 02:08:55.279]  See, I'm really breaking big stuff here.
[02:08:55.319 --> 02:08:56.399]  I don't just come on here and say stuff.
[02:08:57.619 --> 02:09:00.239]  So, I have a lot of amazing contacts.
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:03.420]  So clearly that's the right thing to do.
[02:09:03.539 --> 02:09:14.460]  That's great news that Trump hasn't said anything since Tuesday when the United States of America and then the UK started bombing the hell out of Russia with high-powered precision missiles.
[02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:17.560]  Where was he?
[02:09:17.659 --> 02:09:19.739]  Well, I said, I bet he's doing peace deals.
[02:09:19.899 --> 02:09:21.739]  And then sure enough, I made calls and yeah, that's the case.
[02:09:22.819 --> 02:09:24.640]  So that's great.
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:26.680]  But what are the globalists going to do?
[02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:29.319]  Are they going to get smart and back off?
[02:09:30.079 --> 02:09:34.680]  And even if some of them do, they're not just one faction.
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:40.840]  I mean, they've got a goal, globalism, dominance, control, casual society, domestication of humanity, depopulation.
[02:09:41.239 --> 02:09:42.520]  But there's different factions.
[02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:46.739]  Clearly, the bad guys are going to stage a false flag to blame Russia.
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:48.180]  I mean, it's not going to.
[02:09:48.859 --> 02:09:53.960]  Zelensky's been caught three times attacking their own reactors and blaming it on the Russians.
[02:09:55.250 --> 02:09:55.810]  Three times.
[02:09:56.130 --> 02:10:05.789]  You'll hear, oh, Russia just shot missiles or artillery at this reactor that the Russians are holding in eastern Ukraine, and then it comes out later, well, actually, it was the Ukrainians.
[02:10:06.930 --> 02:10:15.270]  And then the Ukraine fired multiple missiles into Poland a year and a half ago, and then Zelensky said, it's Russia, attack them, World War III, full war.
[02:10:15.689 --> 02:10:21.789]  And then Poland went, actually, we shot down both the missiles, so they didn't detonate properly.
[02:10:21.789 --> 02:10:22.970]  We have the tail numbers.
[02:10:25.629 --> 02:10:29.729]  If you're Ukraine, who by the way wasn't shooting any Russian missiles when this happened.
[02:10:29.890 --> 02:10:31.229]  So they staged it for sure.
[02:10:31.489 --> 02:10:33.189]  There was no incoming Russian missiles.
[02:10:33.409 --> 02:10:54.729]  They just fire these anti-aircraft missiles or anti-missile missiles over the border into Poland and then instantly say that Russia attacked Poland and then the Polish military goes and shows on the news the ends of the rockets and it's Ukrainian missiles.
[02:10:58.150 --> 02:11:05.850]  So, you'd think if they were going to stage that, they'd be smart enough to at least, you know, take the tail numbers off of them, or take the make and model off of them.
[02:11:06.609 --> 02:11:11.850]  So, they've tried to stampede us into total war multiple times.
[02:11:12.770 --> 02:11:17.630]  And remember they said Putin blew up the Nord Stream pipeline, and Putin was blowing up his own Kursk bridge.
[02:11:17.909 --> 02:11:19.810]  I mean, ridiculous garbage.
[02:11:21.110 --> 02:11:23.829]  So, it's not that they're going to stage false flags.
[02:11:23.970 --> 02:11:24.949]  They've already done it.
[02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:34.550]  So, the clearest indication of future behavior is past behavior and criminology or anything in life, business, you name it, relationships.
[02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:37.750]  So, yeah.
[02:11:38.250 --> 02:11:40.050]  Will they stage a nuclear false flag?
[02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:43.329]  Will they nuke Trump in America and say the Iranians did it?
[02:11:44.199 --> 02:11:54.699]  I mean, I was the first to say, two days after they tried to kill Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13th, I said, now they're going to start saying the Iranians are behind it and behind future attacks and service-to-air missiles.
[02:11:55.439 --> 02:12:01.000]  Two days later, exactly that, the FBI. It's not hard to know their moves when you're not naive.
[02:12:01.119 --> 02:12:02.600]  By the way, I meant to air this yesterday and I didn't.
[02:12:02.699 --> 02:12:13.239]  Guys, get the three-minute Oklahoma City boil-down video by the Corbett report because this is the same cabal in control of our government.
[02:12:15.050 --> 02:12:24.069]  The Clinton-Obama cabal that did that back in 1995, and Bill Clinton said, I won re-election because of this.
[02:12:25.369 --> 02:12:28.289]  Because Oklahoma City, you blame the Republicans for it.
[02:12:28.430 --> 02:12:30.609]  Blame Rush Limbaugh, the Alex Jones of the day.
[02:12:31.810 --> 02:12:34.430]  So that's their next move.
[02:12:34.770 --> 02:12:37.250]  And it can be racial false flags as well.
[02:12:37.409 --> 02:12:38.750]  They pre-programmed that, but...
[02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:41.859]  You know, I said before Trump got elected, I said, I'll win a landslide.
[02:12:41.979 --> 02:12:43.119]  If it's big enough, I'll override them.
[02:12:43.380 --> 02:12:44.760]  We caught them on all the fraud.
[02:12:45.239 --> 02:12:48.899]  But I said the pre-programming is mainly to escalate the war with Russia.
[02:12:48.899 --> 02:12:49.979]  That's what they're getting set up.
[02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:50.579]  You can see it.
[02:12:50.899 --> 02:12:55.880]  But also they were doing a lot of pre-programming on Trump supporters are going to kill black people or migrants en masse.
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:57.560]  And that's another big article I've got.
[02:12:58.819 --> 02:13:14.010]  The Democrats are all over the news, and I'll go over this in a moment, both federal, state, and local saying Trump's coming to kill The illegal aliens with his deportation operation, and they're saying we're going to stand up and fight.
[02:13:14.529 --> 02:13:21.369]  And the governor of California, the governor of Massachusetts, the governor of New York, they're all saying we're going to fight the feds.
[02:13:21.449 --> 02:13:28.350]  And now Denver mayor predicts Tiananmen Square showdown against federal forces trying to deport illegals.
[02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:44.890]  So, that's how they're going to sell Trump as Hitler, and will they have somebody, when a big group's getting deported, in a parking garage or somewhere from concealment, shoot a bunch of illegals, and then they trigger all their leftist mobs to burn the cities?
[02:13:48.699 --> 02:13:50.039]  That's not even a prediction.
[02:13:50.819 --> 02:13:52.060]  That's where they're going.
[02:13:52.439 --> 02:13:53.579]  I mean, they're everywhere.
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:54.279]  You see them.
[02:13:54.399 --> 02:13:55.060]  I don't need to play the clips.
[02:13:55.199 --> 02:13:55.640]  I already have.
[02:13:56.260 --> 02:13:57.619]  You've probably seen clips I haven't seen.
[02:13:57.720 --> 02:13:58.079]  There's so many.
[02:13:58.159 --> 02:13:59.500]  I can't even think of them all.
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:02.539]  Where they're everywhere saying Trump's coming to kill the black men.
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:06.220]  There needs to be black men uprising violently if Trump gets elected.
[02:14:06.359 --> 02:14:06.819]  James Carville.
[02:14:09.260 --> 02:14:11.840]  And we're going to be at civil war conditions if he gets elected.
[02:14:12.100 --> 02:14:12.659]  Jamie Raskin.
[02:14:14.159 --> 02:14:18.859]  So if you think they're You're gravely mistaken.
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.279]  They're just playing possum, as Roger Stone said right now.
[02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:32.600]  So, escalation war, false flags blamed on Russia, racial attacks on migrants or black people, and we've got to get ahead of this, which we have.
[02:14:33.079 --> 02:14:42.930]  When this happens, if it happens, which they look like they're going to do, People are going to find the clips of me saying this, not just the millions watching now, and it'll get 100 million views.
[02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:45.770]  And people will then ask, well, yeah, who did stand the game?
[02:14:45.930 --> 02:14:50.949]  And then immediately you'll see the anomalies and the feds handling the shooter or the bomber.
[02:14:53.409 --> 02:14:56.090]  They can blow up another federal building and say Trump supporters did it.
[02:14:56.170 --> 02:14:57.109]  I mean, it's on.
[02:14:58.740 --> 02:15:01.479]  It's absolutely going down right now.
[02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:05.380]  And I said they're going to start bombing Russia when he's president-elect, and it happened.
[02:15:05.779 --> 02:15:08.720]  So that came true, and I'm not happy about it.
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:16.260]  All right, let's go to that short Oklahoma City report.
[02:15:17.060 --> 02:15:20.060]  Good to know the group currently in charge is the same cabal.
[02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:26.300]  And they've telegraphed very clearly that this is their next move.
[02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:30.619]  So they did the bombing of Russia that I said they'd do.
[02:15:31.159 --> 02:15:34.159]  And now will they do the false flag?
[02:15:34.359 --> 02:15:37.060]  And will they wait until he's in office or will they do it before?
[02:15:37.199 --> 02:15:38.260]  The racial false flag.
[02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:41.119]  So we're all waiting for that right now.
[02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:44.720]  Here's a brief snapshot of the inside job.
[02:15:44.819 --> 02:15:47.340]  You can pause each piece of this and go look up what...
[02:15:48.670 --> 02:15:50.609]  The reporter is saying it's all true.
[02:15:51.010 --> 02:15:52.109]  It's all insane.
[02:15:52.369 --> 02:15:57.250]  I've interviewed FBI agents that blew the whistle, the police officers that blew the whistle, the workers in the building.
[02:15:57.850 --> 02:15:59.289]  It all came out in court.
[02:15:59.550 --> 02:16:01.409]  The CIA and Justice Department ran the attack.
[02:16:04.130 --> 02:16:04.970]  It's insane.
[02:16:06.430 --> 02:16:08.369]  And it wasn't a truck bomb that did it.
[02:16:08.470 --> 02:16:10.510]  It was bombs inside, but a bunch didn't detonate.
[02:16:10.670 --> 02:16:12.350]  They removed those on the news.
[02:16:13.789 --> 02:16:14.590]  It's crazy.
[02:16:14.729 --> 02:16:15.270]  Here's the report.
[02:16:15.630 --> 02:16:17.710]  Are you the Oklahoma City bomber?
[02:16:18.909 --> 02:16:26.250]  Maybe one of the benefits of me talking to you today is that you'll see that maybe not everything is true that you've heard about me.
[02:16:26.670 --> 02:16:36.250]  On the morning of April 19, 1995, a decorated Gulf War combat vet blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City using a truck bomb that he didn't build and a rider truck that he didn't rent with the help of a passenger who didn't exist.
[02:16:36.510 --> 02:16:45.709]  Having just gotten away with the largest act of terrorism on U.S. soil to date, the Fort Bragg train Special Forces' sheep drip dropout blended in with the crowd by making his getaway in a car without a license plate and was immediately pulled over.
[02:16:46.290 --> 02:16:50.729]  The ATF was the supposed target of the attack, but luckily all of their agents were out of the office that morning.
[02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:56.069]  Later that day, the president boldly declared, We will find the people who did this.
[02:16:56.520 --> 02:17:03.920]  And when we do, justice will be swift, certain, and severe.
[02:17:04.540 --> 02:17:07.040]  Except for John Doe number two.
[02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:08.579]  John Doe number two.
[02:17:08.659 --> 02:17:09.840]  John Doe number two.
[02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:12.829]  Who, according to the FBI, never existed.
[02:17:13.409 --> 02:17:18.489]  In McVeigh's unprecedented three-and-a-half-week trial, the prosecution didn't show the CCTV footage of him and John Doe No.
[02:17:18.590 --> 02:17:24.229]  2 parking the rider truck, didn't explain why 24 separate witnesses mass hallucinated the existence of John Doe No.
[02:17:24.329 --> 02:17:32.629]  2, didn't explain why the government was testing truck bombs and the army was storing rider trucks at Camp Gruber right before the bombing, and didn't talk to the FBI informants who blew the whistle on the plot.
[02:17:32.889 --> 02:17:38.670]  But they did collaborate with the CIA, and they did convict McVeigh as the lone wolf bomber and Terry Nichols as his bomb-constructing accomplice.
[02:17:39.379 --> 02:17:48.340]  Still, a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists, including 300 bombing victims, insist on talking about facts and evidence and refuse to simply believe what they've been told a million times by people in tailored suits with well-coffed hair.
[02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:57.020]  They quote the US Army Brigadier General and the FBI crime lab whistleblower and the inventor of the neutron bomb, who point out the physical impossibility that the rider truck bomb did the damage to the building.
[02:17:57.139 --> 02:18:00.559]  But that doesn't matter, because if there were other bombs in the building that day, we would have heard about them.
[02:18:00.719 --> 02:18:03.840]  The second explosive was found and diffused.
[02:18:04.020 --> 02:18:05.479]  I think he said another bomb.
[02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:10.819]  The Justice Department is reporting that a second explosive device has been found.
[02:18:11.139 --> 02:18:15.219]  They then found a third device, which was also larger than the first.
[02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:19.860]  And I see another bomb truck going, so apparently they're going to try to get out that third bomb.
[02:18:20.239 --> 02:18:23.299]  The FBI claims to have lost the footage showing Mugbe and John Doe No.
[02:18:23.399 --> 02:18:25.559]  2, parking the truck in front of the Murrah building that morning.
[02:18:25.579 --> 02:18:28.879]  But that's understandable because the Bureau has a lot of important evidence to store.
[02:18:29.569 --> 02:18:35.870]  Terry Nichols insists the FBI was involved in the plot, but thankfully a judge has saved us the trouble of listening to him by preventing lawyers from deposing him.
[02:18:36.190 --> 02:18:41.450]  There was a bomb squad truck parked across the street two hours before the blast, but that just shows the authorities were prepared for anything.
[02:18:42.090 --> 02:18:42.530]  And...
[02:18:42.530 --> 02:18:52.850]  Other documents obtained by 2020 show that someone called the Executive Secretariat's office at the Justice Department in Washington and said the Morrow building had been bombed.
[02:18:53.010 --> 02:18:55.809]  But this was 24 minutes before the blast.
[02:18:56.719 --> 02:18:59.260]  But that just shows the public was unusually vigilant that morning.
[02:19:00.340 --> 02:19:00.780]  Also...
[02:19:00.780 --> 02:19:08.440]  Apparently, before the bombing, Governor Frank Keating's brother, Mark, had been working on a novel about a terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City.
[02:19:08.579 --> 02:19:09.260]  Stranger still.
[02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:12.819]  One of the characters in the novel was named Thomas McVeigh.
[02:19:13.020 --> 02:19:14.639]  But that's probably just a coincidence.
[02:19:15.459 --> 02:19:21.799]  McVeigh wrote a letter to his sister where he admitted to being a secret special forces operative, and he complained to friends of the pain in his ass from an army-implanted microchip.
[02:19:21.899 --> 02:19:25.780]  But that's crazy, because if he didn't actually leave the army in 1991, there would be proof of that.
[02:19:29.829 --> 02:19:33.610]  McVeigh was not executed on May 16, 2001, as scheduled because...
[02:19:33.610 --> 02:19:39.350]  The FBI had failed to turn over thousands of pages of evidence to McVeigh's defense attorneys.
[02:19:40.409 --> 02:19:42.270]  But the execution went ahead on June 11th.
[02:19:42.629 --> 02:19:45.690]  In a highly unusual and secret agreement, no autopsy was performed.
[02:19:45.909 --> 02:19:49.709]  One witness said he was still breathing, and the prison officials admitted his hearse was a decoy.
[02:19:50.069 --> 02:19:51.790]  Then, the case was officially closed.
[02:19:51.989 --> 02:19:59.229]  And if you question any part of this story, you are a paranoid, wingnut, birther, truther, tenther, prepper, conspiracy loon who would bring up any of these points ever again.
[02:19:59.969 --> 02:20:00.329]  Ever.
[02:20:01.370 --> 02:20:07.069]  This message has been brought to you by the friends of the FBI, ATF, DOJ, CIA, SBLC, MSN, and the U.S. Army.
[02:20:08.170 --> 02:20:10.350]  And remember, ignorance is strength.
[02:20:12.149 --> 02:20:18.610]  And the Southern Barber Law Center is a German intelligence agency group.
[02:20:19.450 --> 02:20:28.209]  And they ran Elohim City, the white supremacist compound where all this was supposedly hatched.
[02:20:28.629 --> 02:20:32.909]  And then they infiltrated with an employee two years ago.
[02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:41.909]  And We're good to go.
[02:20:43.829 --> 02:20:52.290]  We're good to go.
[02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:57.709]  You're attack dog when it's defending you.
[02:20:57.829 --> 02:20:59.450]  And I am that attack dog.
[02:20:59.750 --> 02:21:01.889]  And I want to attack the enemy politically.
[02:21:02.090 --> 02:21:02.829]  I will never stop.
[02:21:03.030 --> 02:21:07.709]  But again, I hate begging, but I hate giving up worse.
[02:21:08.190 --> 02:21:14.829]  We had enough funds, as I told you two weeks ago, to do what we were doing and have the backup network continue on.
[02:21:15.969 --> 02:21:20.690]  And then they had a fake auction and shut the building down and all the rest of that.
[02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:22.469]  And we could still operate the auctions network.
[02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:26.239]  But the illegals was illegally, so we have to fight that.
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:26.940]  We're back in the building.
[02:21:27.059 --> 02:21:27.920]  That takes a bunch of money.
[02:21:28.059 --> 02:21:33.700]  And then people think the AlexJonesStore.com is owned by The Onion, even though it's not even owned by me and is by a sponsor.
[02:21:34.040 --> 02:21:37.600]  And so we saw massive support leave that because people think, well, it's over.
[02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:38.459]  Alex Jones is off the air.
[02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:42.340]  And Joe Rogan calls me last night and says, are you on the air or off the air?
[02:21:42.379 --> 02:21:42.959]  This is crazy.
[02:21:43.260 --> 02:21:45.040]  I see you're on the air, but they say you're off the air.
[02:21:45.139 --> 02:21:46.340]  And I sent him the information.
[02:21:46.440 --> 02:21:46.940]  This is crazy.
[02:21:47.889 --> 02:21:51.409]  So, you know, it's like I can't sit there and call each and every person.
[02:21:51.409 --> 02:21:52.709]  I can't sit there and explain this to everybody.
[02:21:52.709 --> 02:21:56.209]  I don't want to sit here to the regular listeners that know all this and just keep repeating it.
[02:21:56.350 --> 02:22:03.809]  But we've seen a little bit more of the funds come back on a daily basis that we had, but not...
[02:22:03.809 --> 02:22:06.889]  I mean, just the AlexShieldSquare.com has been down 50%.
[02:22:08.149 --> 02:22:09.350]  And now it's down like 30%.
[02:22:09.350 --> 02:22:11.709]  Well, we had just enough.
[02:22:11.709 --> 02:22:14.870]  As I told you two weeks ago, we're at about a tenth of a tank here to operate.
[02:22:15.030 --> 02:22:21.690]  Now we're literally driving down the road, don't see a gas station, and it's flashing that you're about to go out of gas.
[02:22:22.929 --> 02:22:25.229]  So these are great products you need.
[02:22:25.350 --> 02:22:26.909]  These are great sweepstakes.

[02:22:38.809 --> 02:22:39.790]  They're all amazing.
[02:22:42.079 --> 02:22:43.559]  This is how you win.
[02:22:43.819 --> 02:22:44.860]  You donated to Trump.
[02:22:45.079 --> 02:22:45.899]  You voted for Trump.
[02:22:46.059 --> 02:22:46.879]  You spread the word.
[02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:48.139]  We won the big battle.
[02:22:48.260 --> 02:22:49.260]  Now we've got to win the war.
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:51.139]  You supported me for years through all these fights.
[02:22:51.219 --> 02:22:52.000]  I humbly thank you.
[02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:56.739]  Now we're having big victory, but the enemy's counterstruck desperately.
[02:22:57.299 --> 02:22:59.459]  I can't do it without you.
[02:23:00.659 --> 02:23:03.139]  I exposed Oklahoma City back when it happened.
[02:23:03.989 --> 02:23:10.850]  I was on Access Television showing the newscasts that people mailed me from the Patriot Network up in Oklahoma City.
[02:23:11.530 --> 02:23:12.989]  We had massive viewers.
[02:23:13.110 --> 02:23:15.870]  People were freaking out seeing all of this stuff you just saw in that clip.
[02:23:17.209 --> 02:23:19.209]  Imagine back then there wasn't video on the internet.
[02:23:19.209 --> 02:23:21.750]  It was on Access TV. The ratings came out.
[02:23:23.129 --> 02:23:31.270]  And in the newspaper said, the Alex Jones Show is getting the same ratings on local TV as UT football games.
[02:23:31.510 --> 02:23:33.450]  It wasn't that I was that dynamic.
[02:23:33.530 --> 02:23:36.010]  It was that people had never seen anything like this.
[02:23:36.909 --> 02:23:37.729]  You understand?
[02:23:38.049 --> 02:23:40.389]  We'll be right back with Massive News, your calls and more.
[02:23:40.829 --> 02:23:49.870]  Many of the supplements available at thealexjonesstore.com are the latest cutting edge, highest rated game changers that have been discovered through research.
[02:23:50.049 --> 02:23:51.049]  And that's wonderful.
[02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:58.559]  But many of the products there are known, tried-and-true staples like elderberry.
[02:23:59.100 --> 02:24:13.299]  It's just that ours is high quality, very strong, concentrated, and at a competitive price, especially if you get more than one model, then it's some of the best prices you'll find anywhere, and your purchase funds are operations against a globalist, a 360 win.

[02:24:27.700 --> 02:24:28.440]  It's antiviral.
[02:24:28.600 --> 02:24:36.459]  So now, high-quality, ultimate elderberry, scientific name, Sambuscus, available right now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:24:36.459 --> 02:24:38.819]  It's good for your body, and it funds the Infowar.
[02:24:40.260 --> 02:24:41.819]  All right, we are back live.
[02:24:41.819 --> 02:24:42.979]  I want to give the phone number out.
[02:24:44.629 --> 02:24:53.729]  And I want to take your phone calls on any subject you want to discuss, but obviously Trump's secret peace summit, the head of NATO there, now it's coming out, tomorrow's news today.
[02:24:54.750 --> 02:24:59.610]  So the next big issue is, what are the globalist factions going to do to derail this?
[02:24:59.850 --> 02:25:05.450]  False flag attacks, other events blamed on Russia, blamed on Iran, blamed on China.
[02:25:05.709 --> 02:25:10.049]  We are in a very dangerous time until January 20th.
[02:25:10.779 --> 02:25:25.040]  Then they're going to shift, they could before, but it really gets bad, into false flags killing black people or migrants, because that's all been pre-programmed, that Trump's going to kill the brown people, and now we've got with no evidence.
[02:25:25.579 --> 02:25:32.860]  So then you say, okay, they've done this before, they staged up before, they're betting everything on this, it's clearly they're doing this.
[02:25:34.059 --> 02:25:51.340]  It'd be like, if your mom comes home when you're a kid, From the grocery store, you see that she's bought a bunch of chicken, and you see fried chicken mix on the table,
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:52.559]  and you see her putting it out.
[02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:55.620]  After she puts away the rest of the groceries, you go, we're having fried chicken tonight.
[02:25:56.659 --> 02:25:58.899]  Well, this isn't fried chicken we're about to have.
[02:26:00.979 --> 02:26:03.379]  This is civil war.
[02:26:04.590 --> 02:26:20.069]  So I told you until your ears bled, I think most of you knew this already, but for those that didn't, that as soon as he was president-elect, the main thing would be starting and accelerating a war with Russia, and that would be bombing them with these missiles they already sent over there and got ready.
[02:26:20.209 --> 02:26:21.729]  That was not hard to guess.
[02:26:22.409 --> 02:26:30.750]  And the false flag against migrants and black people Is the next thing according to all of their statements.
[02:26:31.010 --> 02:26:34.510]  Because again, it makes no sense all the stuff they're saying out of a clear blue sky.
[02:26:34.649 --> 02:26:36.090]  Yeah, Trump's going to kill the Hispanics.
[02:26:36.370 --> 02:26:37.469]  Sure, yeah, that really...
[02:26:37.469 --> 02:26:38.930]  A, he doesn't want to do that.
[02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.829]  B, it'd be horrible.
[02:26:40.069 --> 02:26:42.950]  I mean, Trump's going to blow his feet off tomorrow.
[02:26:44.629 --> 02:26:46.129]  You know, Trump's going to just...
[02:26:46.129 --> 02:26:46.690]  What?
[02:26:48.530 --> 02:26:51.829]  But the mayor of Denver and others...
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:57.120]  Stories up on Infowars.com are telling us exactly what they're going to do.
[02:26:57.280 --> 02:26:59.180]  So I want to talk to you, obviously, about that.
[02:27:00.700 --> 02:27:02.639]  What do you see in pre-programming for?
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:05.100]  Denver mayor predicts Tiananmen Square showdown.
[02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:12.059]  That's where thousands and thousands of Chinese, mainly college students that wanted freedom, democracy protesters, got killed.
[02:27:13.569 --> 02:27:17.750]  Denver mayor predicts Tiananmen Square showdown against federal forces trying to deport illegals.
[02:27:17.850 --> 02:27:19.370]  He says, we're going to fight back.
[02:27:19.489 --> 02:27:20.170]  We're not going to comply.
[02:27:20.329 --> 02:27:22.049]  There's going to be big demonstrations, blah, blah, blah.
[02:27:22.450 --> 02:27:24.010]  We're not going to let the feds come in here.
[02:27:24.170 --> 02:27:26.190]  Well, that's federal jurisdiction is illegal aliens.
[02:27:27.489 --> 02:27:31.950]  So the feds do all this stuff they don't have jurisdiction in, but they have jurisdiction on that in the Constitution.
[02:27:32.629 --> 02:27:33.850]  And it's been the opposite.
[02:27:34.010 --> 02:27:41.729]  We've got a government using the feds to accelerate as an amplifier to fire hose illegals into the country.
[02:27:42.870 --> 02:27:48.149]  And to give them all this free goodies and everything to get here and using UN NGOs to finance their arrival at our steps.
[02:27:49.629 --> 02:27:53.950]  So, all these governors and mayors said they're going to resist.
[02:27:55.270 --> 02:27:57.329]  They're clearly going to stage a bunch of violence.
[02:27:59.389 --> 02:28:01.809]  If the cops do anything, they'll call it terrorist.
[02:28:02.729 --> 02:28:04.010]  But they won't just do that.
[02:28:04.170 --> 02:28:05.950]  They're going to mow down a bunch of illegals.
[02:28:06.909 --> 02:28:10.610]  And probably at the same time, truck bomb a black college or something.
[02:28:10.809 --> 02:28:14.290]  And I just say black college, I think, what's a big gathering of black people?
[02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:16.370]  I mean, that's...
[02:28:16.370 --> 02:28:18.489]  So it's clearly a black target.
[02:28:20.090 --> 02:28:22.409]  Black college, big black megachurch.
[02:28:23.389 --> 02:28:33.350]  I mean, if I was a big black megachurch, say, in Atlanta, and Trump actually gets inaugurated, and you see some weird guys in a rider truck...
[02:28:34.100 --> 02:28:35.200]  You need to call the police.
[02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:36.340]  You need to get away from that truck.
[02:28:36.559 --> 02:28:38.360]  And it probably will just be nothing.
[02:28:38.559 --> 02:28:41.520]  But, I mean, good chance you're about to get your ass blown off.
[02:28:42.159 --> 02:28:44.520]  So, I mean, this is dangerous.
[02:28:45.579 --> 02:28:51.780]  So, but they may not do it because we're ahead of them and people are not going to buy that.
[02:28:52.379 --> 02:28:54.799]  Oh, Trump supporter truck bombs black church.
[02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:56.280]  I mean, come on, people.
[02:28:57.540 --> 02:29:01.260]  So, but that's not going to help the black folks that get killed.
[02:29:03.399 --> 02:29:05.540]  And, you know, I'm not even against these illegal aliens.
[02:29:05.700 --> 02:29:05.979]  I get it.
[02:29:06.059 --> 02:29:06.379]  They're food.
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:10.260]  Everything was shot off by the UN, by the WEF under the lockdowns.
[02:29:10.299 --> 02:29:12.420]  They get organized to come here, told they're going to get all this free stuff.
[02:29:12.559 --> 02:29:13.860]  They're not even bad people.
[02:29:13.959 --> 02:29:14.579]  Some are criminals.
[02:29:15.020 --> 02:29:16.520]  They've dumped them out of the prisons of Venezuela.
[02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:18.479]  But on average, they're refugees of the New World Order.
[02:29:18.899 --> 02:29:19.379]  Doesn't matter.
[02:29:19.420 --> 02:29:23.860]  They're being used as a political weapon to change the proportionment of Congress, the number of Democrat seats.
[02:29:24.079 --> 02:29:25.159]  That's election fraud right there.
[02:29:25.299 --> 02:29:27.100]  They tell them you got to go vote or you'll be deported.
[02:29:27.219 --> 02:29:27.860]  That's been confirmed.
[02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:29.040]  So they're being used.
[02:29:30.239 --> 02:29:30.860]  As a weapon.
[02:29:30.959 --> 02:29:35.500]  Look, I'm not against a brick, you know, laying in an abandoned lot.
[02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:43.159]  But if I park next to it at some business and a crazy person grabs it and wants to hit me in the head with it, well, now I got a problem with the brick.
[02:29:43.639 --> 02:29:46.180]  And the illegals are a brick they're hitting us over the head with.
[02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:49.610]  And there's another giant bunch of caravans.
[02:29:50.090 --> 02:29:52.030]  First it was one of like 30,000.
[02:29:52.030 --> 02:29:53.030]  Now they say there's two more.
[02:29:53.250 --> 02:29:57.909]  And Biden's announced yesterday, I'll just legalize all of you on this app we have.
[02:29:57.989 --> 02:30:03.670]  And the headlines, new app will legalize them all or bypass the Border Patrol.
[02:30:05.329 --> 02:30:09.569]  Harris and Biden and Mayorkas put that in almost four years ago.
[02:30:09.790 --> 02:30:16.010]  I remember J.D. Vance raised it, and the debate moderators fact-checked him and said it wasn't true.
[02:30:16.469 --> 02:30:17.889]  B.S., it wasn't true.
[02:30:18.049 --> 02:30:19.350]  They just said it didn't exist.
[02:30:19.530 --> 02:30:22.430]  Any idiot could go, we covered it three and a half years ago.
[02:30:23.430 --> 02:30:25.270]  And now they act like it's new.
[02:30:25.389 --> 02:30:25.909]  Oh, guess what?
[02:30:26.010 --> 02:30:28.069]  This app allows you to do whatever you want.
[02:30:30.370 --> 02:30:30.809]  So...
[02:30:32.659 --> 02:30:34.559]  Guys, let me just tell you this.
[02:30:34.860 --> 02:30:43.899]  Try to find the J.D. Vance fact-checked on app that lets migrants bypass customs.
[02:30:44.219 --> 02:30:45.139]  That'll pull it up.
[02:30:45.399 --> 02:30:50.739]  Or J.D. Vance debate immigration app.
[02:30:50.899 --> 02:30:51.659]  That'll get it.
[02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:53.920]  And she's like, that's ridiculous.
[02:30:54.700 --> 02:30:58.219]  Who was it, ABC? We're fact-checking that.
[02:30:58.219 --> 02:30:59.920]  That doesn't even exist.
[02:31:01.149 --> 02:31:08.469]  That's like saying the Statue of Liberty doesn't exist or the Washington Monument doesn't exist or SeaWorld doesn't exist in Orlando.
[02:31:08.690 --> 02:31:11.649]  I mean, it's just, or the Dallas Cowboys don't play for Dallas, Texas.
[02:31:12.049 --> 02:31:16.329]  I mean, it's just any moron could verify that in five seconds.
[02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:20.809]  But this is the same party that tells us the same cult trusts the science.
[02:31:20.969 --> 02:31:23.190]  Two men can have a baby and there are no X and Y chromosomes.
[02:31:24.460 --> 02:31:27.819]  So, the mayor goes on.
[02:31:27.899 --> 02:31:35.459]  Democrat mayor claims local police and residents would be stationed at the county line to keep them out.
[02:31:36.860 --> 02:31:39.100]  So that headline's not even strong enough.
[02:31:41.399 --> 02:31:56.139]  Globalist Soros Denver mayor promises to resist lawful federal agents conducting Legal duties.
[02:31:56.899 --> 02:32:02.000]  I mean, just saying that is obstruction of justice.
[02:32:04.879 --> 02:32:11.180]  I mean, if I said, if federal marshals guard federal courthouses, I'm saying hypothetically, I'm not saying this.
[02:32:11.899 --> 02:32:16.500]  As an example, probably have a raw story headline, Jones says attack federal courthouses.
[02:32:16.639 --> 02:32:21.430]  No, I'm saying, if I got up here on air with somebody else and said, I don't like these federal courthouses.
[02:32:21.430 --> 02:32:21.889]  They're evil.
[02:32:21.989 --> 02:32:22.969]  Bad things are happening there.
[02:32:23.649 --> 02:32:27.309]  And so we're going to go and resist the federal marshals.
[02:32:27.510 --> 02:32:30.250]  I mean, I'd get indicted in about a week.
[02:32:31.450 --> 02:32:34.469]  And if I organize people to go do it, I'd be arrested that day, and I should.
[02:32:37.370 --> 02:32:42.450]  I guess it was CBS. I thought it was ABC. Yeah, ridiculous fact check on the true statement during CBS debate.
[02:32:42.569 --> 02:32:46.190]  Why did I say ABC? And they said, yeah, there's no app.
[02:32:46.370 --> 02:32:46.950]  Yeah, find the video.
[02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:49.920]  So the app existed.
[02:32:50.120 --> 02:32:51.200]  They did it like three months.
[02:32:51.260 --> 02:32:52.379]  It was three months into office.
[02:32:54.040 --> 02:32:55.780]  It was an already existing app.
[02:32:56.379 --> 02:33:01.879]  When you're about to turn yourself into the port of entry, you could tell them you're coming.
[02:33:02.719 --> 02:33:08.420]  But they then said, no, no, no, the existing app, you just do this and then you just bypass them.
[02:33:10.440 --> 02:33:13.260]  And then we give you an immigration hearing on average in seven years.
[02:33:14.459 --> 02:33:16.340]  That's robotic AI takeover.
[02:33:19.479 --> 02:33:21.940]  So, this mayor, man, I tell you.
[02:33:23.180 --> 02:33:32.700]  The Democrat mayor of Denver, Colorado, claims he used city law enforcement officers to block President-elect Trump's mass deportation efforts.
[02:33:32.719 --> 02:33:33.399]  He says he will.
[02:33:33.920 --> 02:33:35.319]  He will use.
[02:33:37.120 --> 02:33:41.139]  Envisioning a Tiananmen Square-style showdown with federal officials.
[02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:42.440]  Asked by...
[02:33:44.110 --> 02:33:53.829]  Denverite this week, whether the city might aid federal deportation forces, Mayor Mike Johnston replied, absolutely not.
[02:33:53.989 --> 02:33:54.790]  We won't do it.
[02:33:55.270 --> 02:34:01.889]  He went on to say he believed the Colorado governor, Jared Polis, Democrat, would likely deny Trump using the Colorado National Guard.
[02:34:02.110 --> 02:34:12.510]  Unless they were planning on bringing National Guard mobilized from Texas or Alabama to come invade Colorado, I don't know where they would find the forces to begin with, Johnston said.
[02:34:13.780 --> 02:34:15.319]  We show pictures of the article right here.
[02:34:15.799 --> 02:34:21.420]  And that seems to me like a very, very bad idea from the start to finish that no reasonable American would support.
[02:34:21.620 --> 02:34:41.129]  The mayor went on to float the theoretical face-off between federal and city forces that he compared with the iconic Tiananmen Square student-led protest in China in 1989. Imagining throngs of Denver residents blocking federal agents from entering their city.
[02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:50.090]  More than us having DPD stationed at the county line to keep them out, you would have 50,000 Denverites there, Johnston said.
[02:34:50.270 --> 02:34:56.920]  It's like the Tim and Square moment with the Roses and the guns, right?
[02:34:57.219 --> 02:35:05.520]  You have every one of those Highland moms who came out with the migrants, and you do not want to mess with them.
[02:35:05.700 --> 02:35:06.680]  And it goes on.
[02:35:06.819 --> 02:35:09.680]  This is a sensational statement, but they're all saying it.
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:14.840]  So they're telling you, oh, okay, the cops aren't going to follow illegal orders.
[02:35:15.739 --> 02:35:17.139]  The state police aren't.
[02:35:18.079 --> 02:35:33.350]  So the NGOs have already said they're going to mobilize Tens of thousands of people to come confront ICE, and then Trump will call out the National Guard, because that is an insurrection.
[02:35:35.569 --> 02:35:39.149]  And because they're getting in the way of the constitutional duty.
[02:35:39.309 --> 02:35:41.530]  I mean, if the feds are supposed to do anything, it's control the borders.
[02:35:42.489 --> 02:35:44.690]  And deport aliens.
[02:35:45.829 --> 02:35:48.969]  So, and every damn Mexico has way tougher rules than we do.
[02:35:49.049 --> 02:35:49.809]  You think Mexico...
[02:35:51.299 --> 02:35:52.319]  Would put up with this crap?
[02:35:53.159 --> 02:35:59.399]  You think if some Mexican city said we're going to protect all of these people from another country that are here doing all this stuff?
[02:35:59.579 --> 02:36:01.239]  You think the Mexican government would put up with that?
[02:36:01.479 --> 02:36:02.639]  They'd send the military you.
[02:36:03.700 --> 02:36:06.040]  And they'd shoot anybody trying to stop them.
[02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:07.680]  And any other country would.
[02:36:07.899 --> 02:36:08.639]  In history.
[02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:10.200]  So...
[02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:13.899]  This isn't coming.
[02:36:14.079 --> 02:36:15.180]  I told you this for months.
[02:36:15.319 --> 02:36:16.000]  You saw it too.
[02:36:16.639 --> 02:36:17.739]  I'm stating the obvious.
[02:36:18.399 --> 02:36:20.219]  But other shows won't state the obvious.
[02:36:23.729 --> 02:36:24.610]  This is ridiculous.
[02:36:25.110 --> 02:36:35.209]  So they've got this all pre-programmed, they've got this all ready, all over the country, and they've got a talking point that Trump's going to kill black men with zero evidence.
[02:36:35.549 --> 02:36:36.690]  What does that tell you?
[02:36:37.370 --> 02:36:39.489]  So, here's what they're doing.
[02:36:40.790 --> 02:36:56.000]  Bare minimum, when American citizens start seeing 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 Antifa leftists attacking federal agents, doing their duty, Going after drug gangs and human smugglers and all the rest of it,
[02:36:56.020 --> 02:36:56.819]  these Venezuelan gangs.
[02:36:56.959 --> 02:36:57.700]  That's who they're going to hit first.
[02:37:00.319 --> 02:37:02.079]  Citizens are going to go counter-protest.
[02:37:03.540 --> 02:37:04.219]  And they should.
[02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:06.840]  You shouldn't be afraid to do that, even though it could be a setup.
[02:37:07.100 --> 02:37:12.180]  Because you can't just not engage in a fraudulent election because they're stealing it.
[02:37:12.219 --> 02:37:14.819]  You've got to go prove it and draw them out.
[02:37:15.159 --> 02:37:18.479]  And then it takes years to file the lawsuits and go through it all.
[02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:19.719]  Then you start reversing it.
[02:37:19.780 --> 02:37:20.280]  Then you win.
[02:37:20.399 --> 02:37:22.200]  See, you engage it.
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:27.780]  Now, if somebody's running a rig poker game, you don't go play with them because that's a poker game.
[02:37:27.860 --> 02:37:28.600]  You can just go somewhere else.
[02:37:29.459 --> 02:37:34.059]  In your country, when you're facing fraud, you engage it to draw it out.
[02:37:35.139 --> 02:37:36.520]  You draw its fire.
[02:37:36.659 --> 02:37:37.819]  You expose its positions.
[02:37:38.159 --> 02:37:38.799]  Everything's war.
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:42.799]  Business, life, real war, classic war.
[02:37:43.659 --> 02:37:45.559]  And so if you just go, oh, that's rigged.
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:46.600]  I'm not going to engage in it.
[02:37:46.659 --> 02:37:47.200]  You lose.
[02:37:48.980 --> 02:37:51.399]  So, I'm not saying don't go out and peacefully protest.
[02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:53.260]  And Naomi Wolf and others said this.
[02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:53.860]  We need to put a shirt out.
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:56.479]  We have none of you saying peaceful patriot or something.
[02:37:56.700 --> 02:37:59.399]  So you're identified so they can't set you up later.
[02:37:59.879 --> 02:38:07.420]  Now, patriots are so savvy, they're not going to get us like January 6th where they have their own agents blame us.
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:10.879]  Because we'll be there watching that.
[02:38:10.979 --> 02:38:12.040]  It won't just be fist stuff.
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:14.260]  Or guys in black breaking into capital.
[02:38:16.020 --> 02:38:17.319]  I can just see it.
[02:38:18.350 --> 02:38:25.450]  You'll have globalist mercenary shooters on a rooftop or in a van or in a parking garage.
[02:38:26.250 --> 02:38:29.409]  There'll be a protest of 5,000 or so leftists.
[02:38:32.209 --> 02:38:42.430]  And the leftists could wait till the cops come in and then some shooter...
[02:38:44.469 --> 02:38:47.329]  Shoot some of the migrants and blames the cops.
[02:38:47.549 --> 02:38:48.549]  That's one false flag.
[02:38:49.489 --> 02:38:52.709]  Or blames the feds.
[02:38:52.930 --> 02:39:00.950]  Or the person shoots into the crowd and kills a bunch of the migrants, the illegal aliens.
[02:39:01.409 --> 02:39:07.670]  And then that's blamed on a Trump supporter who could be wound up and mentally ill, a Patsy, or the Patsy gets killed.
[02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:08.629]  It was really another shooter.
[02:39:10.129 --> 02:39:13.709]  And then, oh my God, Trump killed little Pepe.
[02:39:13.850 --> 02:39:15.870]  It'll be a three-year-old, you know, that gets shot.
[02:39:16.229 --> 02:39:18.129]  And a woman and an old man.
[02:39:18.389 --> 02:39:23.290]  And oh, there's 27 dead migrants and 43 injured.
[02:39:24.329 --> 02:39:27.690]  And oh, the fires start.
[02:39:27.850 --> 02:39:32.229]  And then the globalists have professional gangs and others start torching cities, blaming Trump.
[02:39:32.670 --> 02:39:34.549]  Then the Russians hit the power.
[02:39:34.729 --> 02:39:38.209]  And power goes off in, you know, half the country for a week.
[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:42.659]  Then Trump's airplane gets blown up.
[02:39:43.860 --> 02:39:45.040]  The Iranians did that.
[02:39:45.139 --> 02:39:45.940]  Now we're at war with Iran.
[02:39:46.180 --> 02:39:49.860]  And in all this confusion, people just don't know what to think, know what to do.
[02:39:50.459 --> 02:39:54.000]  I guarantee you what I just said is a deep state scenario.
[02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:57.120]  They have written down with the teams ready to go.
[02:39:57.940 --> 02:40:01.159]  Now, you have to learn, folks, I'm not just saying that.
[02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:12.309]  I am so immersed in enemy operations that what I just said to you is their plan A. Mixed in with it.
[02:40:12.450 --> 02:40:17.049]  They've also got truck bombs loaded, ready to hit black colleges, ready to hit black mega churches.
[02:40:18.170 --> 02:40:22.010]  I can think of some other big place only black people would be at are mainly black folks.
[02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:27.930]  Yeah, blow up a black college football game or something.
[02:40:30.489 --> 02:40:32.069]  But that, yeah.
[02:40:32.690 --> 02:40:34.850]  So there's that.
[02:40:36.250 --> 02:40:41.549]  So let me give the number out so we can open the phones up and take your calls on any issue you want to discuss.
[02:40:41.850 --> 02:40:44.229]  But obviously I'm talking about false flags and the enemy's next move.
[02:40:44.690 --> 02:40:46.469]  This is not, again, this is not hard.
[02:40:46.629 --> 02:40:47.229]  That's my frustration.
[02:40:47.649 --> 02:40:49.129]  I said they've delivered all the missiles.
[02:40:49.370 --> 02:40:54.049]  Once Trump's president-elect, they'll probably start bombing Russia to escalate and give him that problem.
[02:40:54.309 --> 02:40:54.629]  It's here.
[02:40:56.610 --> 02:41:01.110]  So I expect what I just said to happen.
[02:41:02.989 --> 02:41:16.040]  Probably Once he's in, because then obviously they can really blame him and they'll use his legal, lawful, must-happen plan to deport the military-age men, the criminals, the human traffickers.
[02:41:16.940 --> 02:41:21.639]  So just because we know we're walking into a trap doesn't mean we don't do it because then we're paralyzed.
[02:41:21.659 --> 02:41:35.350]  You expose the trap, you expose who stands to gain, you expose other pre-programming, and then Trump's people have to be very, very careful about And I know they're smart, but they need to make this front and center.
[02:41:35.469 --> 02:41:47.649]  Because the play is, if he gets in office on November, it's elected November 5th, if he gets in office January 20th, that will be the next move.
[02:41:50.489 --> 02:41:52.030]  So, what are we going to do about it?
[02:41:52.110 --> 02:41:55.750]  Toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[02:41:56.870 --> 02:42:00.809]  877-789-2539.
[02:42:03.690 --> 02:42:07.629]  Now, I'm going to hit a bunch of news in the last six, seven minutes of this hour.
[02:42:07.870 --> 02:42:12.989]  I'm going to come back directly with your calls at 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:24.950]  I just also want to say, isn't it amazing we're still on air after two Justice Department attempts to close us since May 31st illegally?
[02:42:25.590 --> 02:42:27.530]  Isn't it amazing that they're in so much trouble?
[02:42:27.670 --> 02:42:29.690]  Isn't it amazing that we're still fighting?
[02:42:29.850 --> 02:42:31.870]  Isn't it amazing we understand the enemy's operation?
[02:42:32.209 --> 02:42:34.670]  Isn't it amazing we have a backup network even if they shut this down?
[02:42:35.190 --> 02:42:36.149]  Wow, we're winning.
[02:42:38.270 --> 02:42:42.750]  And this is a key lighthouse in the fight, guiding in the ships in the storm.
[02:42:45.899 --> 02:42:50.340]  The only way we fail is if we don't back operations like this.
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:56.319]  Well, Tucker reaches as many people as I do or more.
[02:42:56.520 --> 02:42:57.340]  He's doing great.
[02:42:57.520 --> 02:42:58.399]  Rogan's doing great.
[02:42:58.879 --> 02:43:00.379]  Elon Musk is at a whole other level.
[02:43:00.819 --> 02:43:07.620]  I am in the Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson range of importance.
[02:43:07.840 --> 02:43:09.940]  This broadcast, everything we do, this audience.
[02:43:10.920 --> 02:43:18.200]  But when it comes to having the first intel That they then all pick up because it makes sense and they research it.
[02:43:18.379 --> 02:43:19.540]  We are the most important.
[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:23.379]  See, I'm not adopting Elon Musk's worldview.
[02:43:23.379 --> 02:43:25.079]  He has adopted mine.
[02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:28.299]  And I'm not trying to brag and say that.
[02:43:28.479 --> 02:43:32.340]  It's not that I've adopted what Elon Musk is doing.
[02:43:32.540 --> 02:43:41.319]  He's adopted what I'm doing and doing a great job and added some of his own flair and angles to it so I'm fully behind him in what he's doing.
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.120]  So I can't do this without you.
[02:43:46.059 --> 02:43:47.520]  I don't know what's going to happen to Infowars.
[02:43:47.739 --> 02:43:48.979]  Every day is a blessing here.
[02:43:49.180 --> 02:43:53.180]  I believe we're going to keep it with the good guys that really did buy it.
[02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:56.139]  And that's pretty much a sure thing if the judge follows the law.
[02:43:56.200 --> 02:43:56.979]  It's cut and dry.
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:43:58.040]  I don't know, though.
[02:43:58.950 --> 02:44:00.030]  It's a lot of pressure out there.
[02:44:00.489 --> 02:44:01.950]  That's why there's the Alex Jones Network.

[02:45:40.569 --> 02:45:41.770]  And I thank you for your support.
[02:45:41.889 --> 02:45:43.069]  But those are the action points.
[02:45:43.510 --> 02:45:47.950]  If you want to really be in the fight and you've supported before or you haven't supported, it's up to you.
[02:45:48.090 --> 02:45:48.750]  I'm in your hands.
[02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:49.430]  You're in my hands.
[02:45:49.569 --> 02:45:50.430]  I fired the bat signal.
[02:45:51.229 --> 02:46:10.870]  drjonesnaturals.com drjonesnaturals.com or thealexjonesstore.com You can find all those links at the support page at alexjones.live who our sponsors are, where you can donate, all that kind of stuff is at AlexJones.live.
[02:46:11.229 --> 02:46:15.170]  It was, of course, the AlexJones.network.
[02:46:15.309 --> 02:46:16.170]  AlexJones.network.
[02:46:16.569 --> 02:46:17.450]  It's all there.
[02:46:17.610 --> 02:46:18.069]  Bookmark that.
[02:46:18.149 --> 02:46:18.549]  Check that out.
[02:46:18.649 --> 02:46:18.790]  Okay.
[02:46:19.270 --> 02:46:20.290]  Here's what I want to do.
[02:46:20.750 --> 02:46:26.190]  I got some big Epstein news, big news on the economy, big news on the appointment battles.
[02:46:28.610 --> 02:46:31.170]  A lot here.
[02:46:31.950 --> 02:46:42.379]  And more developments from the secret peace summit We're good to go.
[02:46:54.489 --> 02:47:09.969]  Everything from these legendary studios, 16 years in these studios, is because of you and is a gift from you to the public and to the world for justice and freedom and fighting the tyrants and letting them know they will never break our will, they will never break our spirit,
[02:47:09.969 --> 02:47:11.149]  and we're having such success.
[02:47:11.709 --> 02:47:17.370]  So whatever happens, we leave it all in the field, we never surrender, and you have to understand this is personal for you.
[02:47:17.489 --> 02:47:22.690]  This is, when you support us and spread the word, you're not giving something up, you're gaining something.
[02:47:22.809 --> 02:47:23.389]  That's true.
[02:47:24.520 --> 02:47:31.040]  So for those that have supported and spread the word and prayed for us and done that, you are the few, the proud.
[02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:33.120]  You are the 300. You are the Paul Revere.
[02:47:33.219 --> 02:47:33.920]  You are the resistance.
[02:47:34.100 --> 02:47:39.459]  You are amazing because you understand that and you understand the power you have.
[02:47:39.579 --> 02:47:44.440]  And I'm just asking others, the millions and millions watching right now, exercise your power.
[02:47:45.020 --> 02:47:46.319]  Get off the bench.
[02:47:47.710 --> 02:47:50.670]  All will have a success when you learn to do that.
[02:47:51.190 --> 02:47:55.329]  And when you take the CMOS and the products, you're going to go, my God, why did I do it sooner?
[02:47:56.469 --> 02:48:00.850]  We'll be back with our number four, your calls, masses of news, and more.
[02:48:01.270 --> 02:48:01.989]  Stay with us.
[02:48:02.229 --> 02:48:03.489]  They're coming after everybody.
[02:48:03.489 --> 02:48:04.469]  They're coming after Trump.
[02:48:04.569 --> 02:48:05.309]  They're coming after Kennedy.
[02:48:05.569 --> 02:48:07.430]  We need your support, and you don't even come here and do this.
[02:48:07.649 --> 02:48:08.889]  Alex, first of all, I want to thank you.
[02:48:08.989 --> 02:48:09.969]  Give to Alex Jones.
[02:48:10.129 --> 02:48:15.329]  I don't want this guy to have to be, like, wearing a symbol, and we're all going to say, you know, the truth teller formerly known as Alex Jones.
[02:48:15.409 --> 02:48:16.590]  Let's not let that happen.
[02:48:16.809 --> 02:48:18.329]  Well, they're trying to make an example out of me.
[02:48:18.750 --> 02:48:21.329]  I'm not that important, but I've become a rallying point.
[02:48:21.469 --> 02:48:23.690]  I've become like a Roman standard they want to capture.
[02:48:23.829 --> 02:48:24.350]  Explain that.
[02:48:24.450 --> 02:48:24.750]  You're...
[02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:33.780]  Look, I mean, if we don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the First Amendment, if, you know, media, which is, look, it never said only newspapers or the media.
[02:48:33.959 --> 02:48:42.799]  It was anyone that wants to challenge government, anyone that's willing to put the feet to the fire of corporate interests of your government, that is supposed to be free.
[02:48:42.959 --> 02:48:43.979]  Electronic soapbox.
[02:48:44.190 --> 02:48:48.190]  In the end, if you lose, Alex, we all lose.
[02:48:48.329 --> 02:48:54.190]  We will all lose the ability to do tough stories, to take risks, to plant flags where we think there's an issue.
[02:48:54.350 --> 02:48:55.430]  Sometime we'll get it wrong.
[02:48:55.590 --> 02:48:57.489]  I said before, you do a daily show.
[02:48:57.610 --> 02:48:59.389]  It's impossible to nail that to the wall.
[02:48:59.469 --> 02:49:00.430]  I do a weekly show.
[02:49:00.569 --> 02:49:01.969]  I spend more time vetting it.
[02:49:02.090 --> 02:49:02.969]  They're two different animals.
[02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:04.110]  They can't be compared to each other.
[02:49:04.110 --> 02:49:05.489]  They also take stuff out of context.
[02:49:05.649 --> 02:49:06.110]  I'm exaggerating.
[02:49:06.370 --> 02:49:07.469]  Absolutely, that's true.
[02:49:07.590 --> 02:49:12.149]  You know, one of the things that makes you so spectacular, Alex, is long before any of us were here...
[02:49:12.850 --> 02:49:16.129]  You were starting to talk about this deep state.
[02:49:16.329 --> 02:49:27.709]  You were talking about this, you know, a government that was supposed to be of, for and by the people that was being robbed from us by corporate interests, by special interests, by globalists, long before anybody else ever did.
[02:49:28.260 --> 02:49:33.219]  And to imagine you sitting here in this moment, we are in that impactful moment.
[02:49:33.340 --> 02:49:35.500]  And in many ways, not enough people are listening to you.
[02:49:35.680 --> 02:49:51.020]  And I want to say that, you know, I think the vaccine, and we've talked about this before, that was the tip of the spear of the final death blow, which was if we can inject you and own your bodies and own the bodies of your children and pass laws that say that, you know, because of vaccinations,
[02:49:51.020 --> 02:49:53.079]  we've decided that we own your children.
[02:49:53.260 --> 02:49:54.100]  We make a decision.
[02:49:54.139 --> 02:49:55.520]  That's a revolutionary takeover.
[02:49:55.549 --> 02:49:59.709]  It was a revolutionary takeover, and so people like me got alarmed by that.
[02:49:59.889 --> 02:50:04.309]  And we joined forces with people like you that have been really talking about it for a long time.
[02:50:04.450 --> 02:50:07.370]  But I would say that we're at the very last stage.
[02:50:07.430 --> 02:50:12.430]  I was just speaking publicly, and this woman said, if things don't happen that fast, Dale, you're being really dramatic.
[02:50:12.430 --> 02:50:14.809]  I don't think this election matters that much.
[02:50:14.969 --> 02:50:19.370]  I was like, that's because you're looking at this over the last year, maybe two years.
[02:50:19.530 --> 02:50:22.790]  There's people like Bobby that's been fighting the corporate establishment for 40 years.
[02:50:34.719 --> 02:50:44.819]  We're really at the end stage of a takeover and destruction of the one thing that stands in the way of globalist thinking, which is the Constitution of the United States of America.
[02:50:45.059 --> 02:50:47.040]  They're doing all these lawsuits trying to take my name.
[02:50:47.159 --> 02:50:47.879]  People say they can't do that.
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:48.879]  Well, I gotta defend those.
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:49.659]  We're gonna win.
[02:50:49.799 --> 02:50:50.260]  We're already winning.
[02:50:50.360 --> 02:50:51.440]  The judge shut them down last week.
[02:50:51.579 --> 02:50:55.420]  That took high-powered lawyers and that, you know, 50 grand right there to have those briefs ready, okay?
[02:50:55.500 --> 02:50:56.719]  This is total war.
[02:50:56.920 --> 02:50:57.739]  We make it easy.
[02:50:57.840 --> 02:50:59.940]  Great supplements, great t-shirts, great everything.
[02:51:00.219 --> 02:51:01.899]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:51:01.959 --> 02:51:02.799]  Come a VIP member.
[02:51:02.860 --> 02:51:03.879]  You get 40 bucks free a month.
[02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:05.479]  For 30 bucks, you make 10 bucks on that.
[02:51:05.719 --> 02:51:06.739]  It reminds you to go back to the store.
[02:51:06.879 --> 02:51:07.559]  Incredible supplements.
[02:51:07.700 --> 02:51:08.959]  The Ultimate CMOS Superfood.
[02:51:09.120 --> 02:51:11.299]  It's all there at the Alex Jones Store.
[02:51:12.040 --> 02:51:12.780]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:51:12.899 --> 02:51:14.000]  My dad's great supplement company.
[02:51:14.579 --> 02:51:15.379]  DRJonesNationals.com.
[02:51:15.479 --> 02:51:17.139]  That's how we're funding this operation.
[02:51:17.340 --> 02:51:18.440]  Separate from InfoWars.
[02:51:18.579 --> 02:51:19.180]  You go there.
[02:51:19.260 --> 02:51:19.959]  You get t-shirts.
[02:51:20.079 --> 02:51:20.860]  You get ball caps.
[02:51:21.139 --> 02:51:21.819]  You spread the word.
[02:51:21.940 --> 02:51:22.920]  You meet like-minded people.
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:24.159]  You're a walking billboard for freedom.
[02:51:24.239 --> 02:51:25.000]  It's a great adventure.
[02:51:25.200 --> 02:51:26.719]  And you know you're funding our operation.
[02:51:26.819 --> 02:51:27.479]  We need funds.
[02:51:27.600 --> 02:51:29.639]  And I'll go on the offense and just hope the money comes in.
[02:51:29.700 --> 02:51:30.659]  But we're going on the offense.
[02:51:30.959 --> 02:51:31.500]  We caught them.
[02:51:31.540 --> 02:51:32.239]  We got the documents.
[02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:34.600]  I told you I'll sue the CIA and FBI. Get ready.
[02:51:34.940 --> 02:51:36.899]  First step starts This week, and the enemy already knows.
[02:51:37.879 --> 02:51:39.700]  But I need money to do it.
[02:51:39.760 --> 02:51:41.739]  And look, I don't even think about my life or any of that.
[02:51:41.799 --> 02:51:42.319]  That doesn't matter.
[02:51:42.399 --> 02:51:43.059]  I'm on this mission.
[02:51:43.079 --> 02:51:43.600]  I love it.
[02:51:43.639 --> 02:51:44.159]  This is great.
[02:51:44.440 --> 02:51:46.659]  But I need funds to fight a war.
[02:51:47.340 --> 02:51:48.139]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:51:48.979 --> 02:51:49.760]  DrJonesNationals.com.
[02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:51.920]  Those are the coordinates of the resistance.
[02:51:52.319 --> 02:52:00.139]  It's all there, and it's great products at great prices, highest quality, and it funds the fight against the New World Order that's coming down on us with both damn feet.
[02:52:00.239 --> 02:52:02.020]  But at least we're in the fight, and we're starting to win.
[02:52:08.700 --> 02:52:15.500]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[02:52:15.680 --> 02:52:17.860]  You better believe you've got one!
[02:52:19.739 --> 02:52:24.959]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:52:42.629 --> 02:52:46.110]  I got some sad news for you, and I haven't gotten to it yet.
[02:52:46.829 --> 02:52:49.569]  I'll do it after I take a bunch of calls.
[02:52:50.690 --> 02:52:53.989]  But it's not sad at the end of the day because you did a great job fighting the New World Order.
[02:52:55.809 --> 02:52:59.309]  Scott Bennett died yesterday of pancreatic cancer.
[02:53:00.590 --> 02:53:03.229]  And I saw him a few months ago when I was in California.
[02:53:03.229 --> 02:53:06.510]  He was on the show right when they shot Trump.
[02:53:07.420 --> 02:53:08.420]  I'll talk about it later.
[02:53:08.559 --> 02:53:09.319]  I want to do it justice.
[02:53:09.559 --> 02:53:09.860]  Great guy.
[02:53:10.219 --> 02:53:11.600]  And he looks sick to me.
[02:53:13.200 --> 02:53:14.219]  And he's gone.
[02:53:14.719 --> 02:53:15.840]  But not forgotten.
[02:53:16.860 --> 02:53:20.360]  David in Missouri on continuity of government and what's next.
[02:53:20.520 --> 02:53:21.020]  Thanks for calling.
[02:53:23.020 --> 02:53:24.000]  Hello, Alex.
[02:53:24.299 --> 02:53:27.059]  Thank you for your great leadership in these...
[02:53:27.059 --> 02:53:27.860]  Thank you, brother.
[02:53:28.180 --> 02:53:28.559]  ...positive times.
[02:53:29.360 --> 02:53:33.059]  So, you had Daniel Liston with the Dark Journalist.
[02:53:33.200 --> 02:53:34.620]  I'm not even sure how long it's been.
[02:53:34.700 --> 02:53:35.579]  Maybe three or four months.
[02:53:35.700 --> 02:53:36.200]  Maybe longer.
[02:53:37.219 --> 02:53:49.280]  He has, over and over, I listen to his show every week, and he talks about the continuity of government being a play that the Pentagon or the government might use.
[02:53:49.459 --> 02:53:50.639]  Yeah, that's the ultimate coup.
[02:53:50.799 --> 02:53:54.399]  Start a nuclear war, knock out all your opposition, and then re-emerge.
[02:53:55.659 --> 02:53:57.600]  You mean with the continuity of government?
[02:53:57.860 --> 02:53:58.159]  Mm-hmm.
[02:53:59.420 --> 02:54:00.319]  COG. Yes, sir.
[02:54:01.139 --> 02:54:01.299]  Yeah.
[02:54:02.030 --> 02:54:10.649]  So, I mean, it seems like it would be good to get that out into the world and let everybody know that that's a possibility.
[02:54:10.850 --> 02:54:12.930]  Yeah, let's get Dark Journalists back on.
[02:54:13.030 --> 02:54:14.569]  In fact, I'm going to come up here tomorrow.
[02:54:16.389 --> 02:54:17.770]  We'll go live at 2 p.m.
[02:54:17.850 --> 02:54:18.049]  tomorrow.
[02:54:18.190 --> 02:54:18.969]  Things are too important.
[02:54:20.569 --> 02:54:22.469]  I'm going to do a show live at 2 p.m.
[02:54:22.750 --> 02:54:22.750]  tomorrow.
[02:54:22.950 --> 02:54:23.950]  General Flynn's here Monday.
[02:54:25.010 --> 02:54:29.610]  But I'm going to come in tomorrow at 2 p.m., and I'll do at least a two-hour live show tomorrow.
[02:54:31.489 --> 02:54:35.629]  That would be great, Alex, if you got him on there, because I really think that...
[02:54:35.629 --> 02:54:36.809]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:39.430 --> 02:54:40.129]  Anything else?
[02:54:40.489 --> 02:54:43.629]  I think the public needs to be aware of that as being a possibility.
[02:54:44.489 --> 02:54:45.069]  I agree.
[02:54:45.170 --> 02:54:46.350]  What else are you looking at right now?
[02:54:48.370 --> 02:54:55.510]  I mean, I am so hopeful about what's going on with the negotiations that are happening.
[02:54:57.519 --> 02:55:01.579]  Regarding Ukraine and Russia, I mean, that is just so fantastic.
[02:55:01.899 --> 02:55:11.000]  Yeah, I mean, I had videos yesterday that got 10 million views on our X account from the show, but the one announcing that a secret peace summit was going on only got like 5 million.
[02:55:11.260 --> 02:55:12.399]  I mean, we broke that.
[02:55:12.579 --> 02:55:16.100]  I would think this would be big news everywhere, but the corporate media, of course, is ignoring it.
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:22.840]  Trump is having a giant secret peace summit right now at Mar-a-Lago with the head of NATO, and they're talking to Putin, they're talking to all of them.
[02:55:23.159 --> 02:55:27.260]  I would think that'd be bigger news, but I guess it's still getting out here, but wow.
[02:55:28.540 --> 02:55:32.879]  No, it's just so amazing, and you've been so helpful in making all that happen.
[02:55:33.159 --> 02:55:38.700]  I mean, it's so weird to be in this time when there's such great hope, but then...
[02:55:38.700 --> 02:55:41.719]  I'm going to say it again, and I don't say this to be self-deprecating.
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:42.700]  It's because it's everything.
[02:55:42.819 --> 02:55:43.479]  Listen to me, David.
[02:55:44.479 --> 02:55:51.260]  This show is critical, this broadcast is pivotal, and we are affecting change massively, and we have incredible influence.
[02:55:51.420 --> 02:55:57.219]  I can get on the phone with basically anybody I want other than Democrats, but the good guys listen.
[02:55:57.500 --> 02:56:07.500]  So from your mouth to their ears, buddy, I'm explaining you supporting the show, you buying the product, you sharing the articles, you're everything.
[02:56:07.620 --> 02:56:11.559]  So when you say, oh God, this show's having such a big effect, it is, I'm going to explain it again.
[02:56:12.639 --> 02:56:14.920]  I'm the tail, you're the dog.
[02:56:15.180 --> 02:56:17.360]  So people need to drill that into their head.
[02:56:17.780 --> 02:56:18.360]  Drill it in.
[02:56:18.500 --> 02:56:19.559]  Yes, we're changing the world.
[02:56:19.799 --> 02:56:22.280]  God is working through me and all of you, okay?
[02:56:22.540 --> 02:56:26.219]  So to please understand that and just start...
[02:56:26.219 --> 02:56:27.579]  I want callers to do this.
[02:56:27.700 --> 02:56:30.579]  I don't mind being thanked, but it's not right.
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:32.040]  Okay?
[02:56:32.379 --> 02:56:33.000]  Thank you for the call.
[02:56:33.840 --> 02:56:39.780]  When people call in, they need to thank the listeners and supporters and the crew.
[02:56:40.340 --> 02:56:40.860]  Okay?
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:45.799]  Every hundredth call should thank me.
[02:56:46.639 --> 02:56:51.719]  99 of the calls should thank the crew, the guest, and the audience that supports.
[02:56:51.879 --> 02:56:52.819]  It's you.
[02:56:53.059 --> 02:56:56.420]  You, you, [...] you.
[02:56:56.559 --> 02:56:58.680]  We're now into hour number four.
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:02.299]  Taking your phone calls, and I've got a giant...
[02:57:03.709 --> 02:57:05.850]  Stack of huge developments to get to here.
[02:57:06.149 --> 02:57:13.510]  I want to go back to your calls right now, but Zelensky has put out his own little international address like Putin did yesterday, and it's pure crap.
[02:57:14.170 --> 02:57:17.110]  And if you want to see it, it's posted up on Infowars.com.
[02:57:17.469 --> 02:57:19.409]  But let me just paraphrase it for time.
[02:57:20.680 --> 02:57:41.299]  He says, we're totally innocent and peaceful and Russia has attacked us as terrorists and they're testing missiles on us and China is our ally, which is pure crap, and the whole world's against Russia and we've done nothing wrong when they are the front men for NATO bombing the hell out of Russia.
[02:57:42.639 --> 02:57:49.879]  So, oh, Russia just hit military targets in a nuclear delivery system test.
[02:57:50.790 --> 02:57:53.149]  Again, it wasn't nuclear tip, but that's what this was about.
[02:57:53.229 --> 02:57:54.430]  And I told you that before Putin came out.
[02:57:54.510 --> 02:57:57.670]  I said, this is a test to show they can get past missile defenses.
[02:57:58.129 --> 02:58:00.510]  And then he called for missile defenses that can stop it.
[02:58:00.629 --> 02:58:05.190]  Well, they don't have systems that can even mitigate it.
[02:58:05.809 --> 02:58:05.950]  Yeah.
[02:58:07.170 --> 02:58:20.700]  The info that's come out, these type of hypersonic missiles coming in from a ballistic nature, if they deploy $100 million worth of systems against it, I'm in a whole bunch of missiles.
[02:58:21.079 --> 02:58:22.559]  And they're on their toes.
[02:58:22.739 --> 02:58:24.559]  Maybe 10% of the time they can stop it.
[02:58:25.719 --> 02:58:27.719]  So, checkmate.
[02:58:29.459 --> 02:58:31.719]  Which we're already in under mutually assured destruction.
[02:58:31.979 --> 02:58:33.479]  Everybody's in checkmate in a nuclear war.
[02:58:33.920 --> 02:58:34.520]  Stop it.
[02:58:35.100 --> 02:58:36.700]  Stop saying it's survivable.
[02:58:36.799 --> 02:58:39.280]  Stop saying we should have one, like Sean Penn said two years ago.
[02:58:40.040 --> 02:58:41.979]  Sean Penn should be in a lunatic asylum.
[02:58:43.479 --> 02:58:43.959]  Okay?
[02:58:44.260 --> 02:58:46.440]  No, the Russians don't have crap weapons.
[02:58:46.440 --> 02:58:46.899]  Okay?
[02:58:48.249 --> 02:58:49.870]  Like we're hearing from the Pentagon.
[02:58:50.129 --> 02:58:51.969]  I mean, that is a load of horse crap.
[02:58:52.709 --> 02:58:54.170]  Kevin in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:58:54.270 --> 02:58:54.569]  Go ahead.
[02:58:56.110 --> 02:58:56.829]  Hey, Alex.
[02:58:57.110 --> 02:59:01.229]  I've had a couple questions rolling around for four years in my head.
[02:59:01.629 --> 02:59:03.090]  Why did they do six feet?
[02:59:03.229 --> 02:59:04.649]  Why did they do the lockdowns?
[02:59:04.649 --> 02:59:05.590]  Why did they do the masks?
[02:59:06.209 --> 02:59:12.709]  And I think the only answer I can come up with is for the masks, it improves facial recognition software.
[02:59:13.610 --> 02:59:26.340]  For the six feet and the lockdowns, I remember hearing, I think maybe you reported on it, that there were next generation British satellites that were going up before COVID. When they got them up, they saw everything look like spaghetti.
[02:59:26.559 --> 02:59:34.159]  So if you lock everybody down and you have everybody staying apart from each other, you can track and individualize all those sensors with much more granularity.
[02:59:35.510 --> 02:59:37.610]  That's all admitted, but it's worse than that.
[02:59:37.729 --> 02:59:43.629]  China adopted that with their AI. It's here too, but not rolled out publicly.
[02:59:44.409 --> 02:59:50.329]  With their social credit score, where for eight years now, you can't go one half foot out your door if you've done anything they don't like.
[02:59:50.709 --> 02:59:59.870]  Can't go to the mall, can't buy food, can't go to the grocery store, can't get a taxi, can't get on a plane, can't get on a train, can't file your taxes, you become homeless.
[03:00:00.879 --> 03:00:02.120]  That's the BlackRock plan.
[03:00:02.219 --> 03:00:06.979]  Larry Fink has said, we're going to have this worldwide, and we'll totally control your behaviors with this system.
[03:00:07.159 --> 03:00:12.399]  First is the ESG, the corporate structure that they have to follow, or they get cut off by BlackRock.
[03:00:12.399 --> 03:00:15.379]  That's just the front name of 87% of all the wealth in the world.
[03:00:16.139 --> 03:00:17.280]  They've got through fraud.
[03:00:18.360 --> 03:00:19.959]  But there's another big component.
[03:00:20.340 --> 03:00:34.819]  In the BioShield 2004 federally funded program for, quote, bioweapon Defense research is really a giant bioweapon offense program in the defense budget.
[03:00:36.520 --> 03:00:47.219]  George W. Bush, they had a whole plan to launch a plandemic then, and they had it, it's a public document, six feet thin, mask, locking down all the football games to churches.
[03:00:49.310 --> 03:00:54.530]  And so they've had this on the shelf as a slave drill, just to train you to be a prisoner.
[03:00:55.649 --> 03:01:02.989]  And so, and then it's the mask is the psychological fear, like an armband, that you're in the cult.
[03:01:03.329 --> 03:01:15.549]  So the biggest thing is just the psychological control to lock everybody down, that everybody then sees the mask, everybody stays apart, to heighten the fear of other people and the mistrust, you understand?
[03:01:17.569 --> 03:01:19.729]  It's just like trying to get blacks and whites to hate each other.
[03:01:20.530 --> 03:01:21.649]  It's division.
[03:01:22.110 --> 03:01:22.870]  Divide and conquer.
[03:01:24.350 --> 03:01:24.750]  Absolutely.
[03:01:25.629 --> 03:01:27.190]  I've got to say, I love bodies.
[03:01:27.409 --> 03:01:28.329]  I love TurboForce.
[03:01:28.409 --> 03:01:29.190]  Keep doing what you're doing.
[03:01:29.670 --> 03:01:30.469]  Thank you, brother.
[03:01:31.969 --> 03:01:33.170]  TurboForce will be back soon.
[03:01:33.170 --> 03:01:37.450]  It's such an incredible super energy, highest quality, without the letdown.
[03:01:37.629 --> 03:01:40.450]  It'll be back at drjonesnaggles.com, I'm told, in one week.
[03:01:42.809 --> 03:01:45.469]  So, let's go ahead and...
[03:01:46.729 --> 03:01:48.170]  Go to William in Scotland.
[03:01:48.370 --> 03:01:49.590]  William, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:01:51.590 --> 03:01:52.270]  Good evening, Alex.
[03:01:52.549 --> 03:01:54.290]  There's too many of us, and they know it.
[03:01:54.510 --> 03:01:55.530]  Divided, they rule us.
[03:01:55.729 --> 03:01:57.149]  United, we are unstoppable.
[03:01:57.610 --> 03:02:01.049]  They're going to try the World War III, but it's not going to work, Alex.
[03:02:01.229 --> 03:02:04.610]  And I have a report to share with you and everyone listening.
[03:02:04.950 --> 03:02:07.969]  I'm part of a group called the Glasgow Truth Project.
[03:02:07.969 --> 03:02:10.790]  We're on TikTok at GlasgowTruthProject.
[03:02:10.790 --> 03:02:21.129]  And what we do is we beam memes, And videos mocking the globalists onto walls in the main cities in Scotland.
[03:02:21.129 --> 03:02:22.809]  And we've been doing it for years.
[03:02:22.969 --> 03:02:24.709]  I've seen it in the news.
[03:02:24.870 --> 03:02:26.409]  You're very effective in the information war.
[03:02:28.129 --> 03:02:35.309]  Well, yeah, we just would like to share with the people of America that you guys can leverage the months right now.
[03:02:35.489 --> 03:02:37.329]  So summer is over, as we all know.
[03:02:37.469 --> 03:02:39.389]  But going into winter, we have the darkness.
[03:02:39.389 --> 03:02:43.010]  And the darkness is a perfect time to beam memes.
[03:02:43.309 --> 03:02:49.930]  And if you can just get going with a few friends and about $1,000 for a projector, a gazebo, a laptop.
[03:02:50.229 --> 03:02:57.750]  And folks, the great part is like people projecting on the water towers, MAGA. Then the leftists flip out and try to ban it.
[03:02:57.930 --> 03:03:00.069]  Then that one event gets international news.
[03:03:00.209 --> 03:03:02.290]  And then hundreds of millions see the image.
[03:03:02.350 --> 03:03:04.729]  And then you keep doing it and drive them crazy.
[03:03:04.969 --> 03:03:06.690]  So that's civil disobedience.
[03:03:06.770 --> 03:03:16.290]  And you show what tyrants they are, like parents going to school boards where they're teaching white people are evil and that two boys can have a baby and cut Johnny's ding-dong off.
[03:03:16.430 --> 03:03:21.770]  And then the FBI comes out and threatens people and it shows they're tyrants and blows up in their face.
[03:03:21.790 --> 03:03:22.569]  See how you do that?
[03:03:24.370 --> 03:03:24.770]  Absolutely.
[03:03:25.069 --> 03:03:31.729]  I mean, we did a lot of reading before starting this, Alex, and one of the golden threads in the books that we read was mockery.
[03:03:32.149 --> 03:03:41.590]  Mockery is really powerful to help people see that they've been shown a fake reality, and we're able to show them, and they're really resonating.
[03:03:41.729 --> 03:03:44.610]  They weren't a few years ago, but now people are very supportive.
[03:03:44.829 --> 03:03:51.469]  I remember a few months ago, the Australian president got made fun of, and he says, we will fine you, we will arrest you, and it totally blew up in his face.
[03:03:53.369 --> 03:03:58.610]  Yeah, well, good is overcoming evil, Alex, and you and the crew are doing a great job, so thanks for all that you do.
[03:03:58.670 --> 03:03:59.649]  Well, I want to see some of your memes.
[03:03:59.770 --> 03:04:00.829]  I've seen them in the newspapers before.
[03:04:01.450 --> 03:04:02.590]  Where do we go to find them?
[03:04:03.590 --> 03:04:09.450]  TikTok.com forward slash at Glasgow Truth Project.
[03:04:10.290 --> 03:04:12.809]  And we've tried a few different accounts.
[03:04:13.010 --> 03:04:14.129]  You know, we're dealing with censorship.
[03:04:14.290 --> 03:04:15.750]  This one is up for now.
[03:04:15.969 --> 03:04:19.770]  We've had about 200 new followers in the last couple of days.
[03:04:20.010 --> 03:04:22.190]  We had a piece of content that went viral.
[03:04:22.389 --> 03:04:23.969]  Not our wars, not our boys.
[03:04:24.149 --> 03:04:26.649]  That seemed to really resonate as a message with the people.
[03:04:27.170 --> 03:04:28.030]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:04:28.190 --> 03:04:30.690]  And even if you only get a few hundred followers to take it down, you pop back up.
[03:04:30.770 --> 03:04:31.250]  But were you...
[03:04:31.600 --> 03:04:37.680]  What you're doing online is inspiring others to do it, but you are winning at point-blank range, projecting this up in the cities.
[03:04:37.780 --> 03:04:39.659]  That's where the real victory is in the third-dimensional attack.
[03:04:39.799 --> 03:04:40.020]  Thank you.
[03:04:40.639 --> 03:04:42.659]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Chicago.
[03:04:42.739 --> 03:04:43.540]  You're on the air.
[03:04:43.620 --> 03:04:43.920]  Go ahead.
[03:04:45.959 --> 03:04:46.639]  Hey, Alex.
[03:04:46.760 --> 03:04:48.180]  I appreciate you guys taking my call.
[03:04:48.700 --> 03:04:51.239]  Two things I wanted to run past you.
[03:04:52.959 --> 03:05:00.940]  First, and I apologize if this is something you covered on the show that I may have missed over the last couple of weeks.
[03:05:02.340 --> 03:05:17.780]  But do you think it's possible that Putin and Russia never invade Ukraine if Trump took office in 2020?
[03:05:18.659 --> 03:05:20.100]  Oh, I don't think there's any doubt.
[03:05:20.239 --> 03:05:21.200]  Trump said that is true.
[03:05:21.739 --> 03:05:22.360]  It never would have happened.
[03:05:23.440 --> 03:05:28.079]  Okay, so then to counter that question, what if...
[03:05:31.170 --> 03:05:44.950]  Trump and Putin or whoever military got involved, and the only reason why Putin invaded Ukraine was to escalate to deescalate, which I know is talked about a lot in wartime strategy.
[03:05:47.250 --> 03:05:50.909]  Do you think there's any truth to that?
[03:05:51.569 --> 03:05:54.229]  Are you saying Putin invaded to deescalate?
[03:05:55.369 --> 03:05:55.729]  Yes.
[03:05:55.930 --> 03:05:57.270]  Well, that's exactly why he did it.
[03:05:57.329 --> 03:05:59.649]  He said NATO's about to take over Ukraine.
[03:05:59.790 --> 03:06:00.510]  They're arming to the teeth.
[03:06:00.610 --> 03:06:01.450]  They're moving heavy weapons.
[03:06:01.450 --> 03:06:03.510]  And we've been fighting them for years with NATO troops.
[03:06:04.010 --> 03:06:05.670]  This is almost three years ago.
[03:06:05.709 --> 03:06:07.549]  And he said, we're going to go in there and shut this down now.
[03:06:07.549 --> 03:06:08.389]  So they stopped doing it.
[03:06:08.450 --> 03:06:09.530]  That was his stated goal.
[03:06:10.850 --> 03:06:15.209]  Because, you know, two or three years ago, I wasn't really even paying attention to this stuff.
[03:06:15.370 --> 03:06:24.520]  But the more I see things on X and the way this stuff all played out and how confident Trump is when he says, you know, hey, Putin never would have did this.
[03:06:24.600 --> 03:06:40.079]  It almost makes me, like, see it for what it is, and I know a lot of people might agree that, you know, I think Putin and Trump really respect each other, and they have the same goal, which is to fight the deep state,
[03:06:40.200 --> 03:06:51.229]  fight the globalists, and just like you said, you know, Putin's tired of the Western forces and NATO continuously pushing Well, let's explain this.
[03:06:51.909 --> 03:06:57.729]  Putin, if you look at the philosophy he actually follows, he knows the Bolsheviks were put in by the West.
[03:06:57.870 --> 03:06:59.649]  He knows it was a disease put in there.
[03:06:59.930 --> 03:07:01.030]  He says that.
[03:07:02.030 --> 03:07:05.809]  So these establishment right-wingers go, oh, they're communists.
[03:07:05.950 --> 03:07:09.770]  It's all BS. And I don't lionize Putin.
[03:07:09.790 --> 03:07:10.969]  I don't think he's perfect.
[03:07:11.010 --> 03:07:11.930]  He's definitely a strong man.
[03:07:11.930 --> 03:07:12.569]  But here's the deal.
[03:07:12.750 --> 03:07:15.430]  He doesn't want to chop little boys' penises off.
[03:07:15.850 --> 03:07:18.510]  He wants to be the most organic country in the world.
[03:07:19.110 --> 03:07:20.510]  And he's not against his people.
[03:07:20.590 --> 03:07:21.250]  I appreciate the call.
[03:07:21.809 --> 03:07:24.250]  And he's promoting Christianity so the globalists don't like him.
[03:07:24.430 --> 03:07:25.209]  It's real simple.
[03:07:26.170 --> 03:07:27.670]  Let's go to Gary in Florida.
[03:07:27.790 --> 03:07:28.270]  Gary, welcome.
[03:07:29.649 --> 03:07:30.270]  Hey, Alex.
[03:07:30.370 --> 03:07:30.750]  How we doing?
[03:07:30.750 --> 03:07:32.909]  First off, I want to say you're in my prayers, brother.
[03:07:32.930 --> 03:07:33.209]  Thank you.
[03:07:33.409 --> 03:07:36.809]  I got a couple things to say, and I got a couple questions for you.
[03:07:37.290 --> 03:07:49.309]  So, in my opinion, and it doesn't seem like there's any other reason behind it, the whole point of escalating to deep-strike missiles is just to give Trump an untenable situation to tackle.
[03:07:49.590 --> 03:07:55.049]  If they accomplish their goal, which is surprising, as it may sound to some, it's all in their playbook.
[03:07:55.469 --> 03:07:57.809]  It's the same playbook that Israel's working with.
[03:07:57.909 --> 03:08:01.520]  It's the same playbook That the deep state's working with, whatever you want to call them.
[03:08:04.159 --> 03:08:13.059]  Israel and NATO, they will do everything they can to not allow us to not be involved in this fight.
[03:08:13.360 --> 03:08:14.540]  There's an escalation.
[03:08:14.680 --> 03:08:18.819]  They will do whatever they can to keep us involved.
[03:08:18.920 --> 03:08:35.639]  So how do we, as citizens, you know, contacting our representatives, whatever it may be, How do we transform ourselves back into that pre-World War I involvement to where we said, look, this is going on on multiple fronts, and like you said, a multiple front war in different regions of the globe.
[03:08:35.739 --> 03:08:36.420]  That's a world war.
[03:08:36.659 --> 03:08:39.940]  So how do we disinvolve ourselves from this?
[03:08:40.159 --> 03:09:00.059]  And then on top of that, whereas you have a ton of educated voters, millions of educated voters, you have a vastly larger amount We're good to go.
[03:09:01.079 --> 03:09:08.100]  We're good to go.
[03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:14.959]  We're good to go.
[03:09:15.969 --> 03:09:16.690]  Educated voting.
[03:09:17.090 --> 03:09:18.850]  You're doing an amazing job.
[03:09:18.989 --> 03:09:22.170]  Elon Musk saving Twitter, turning it to X. Amazing job.
[03:09:22.270 --> 03:09:27.590]  Joe wrote, Tim Dillon, all the great guys, Theo Vaughn, who were not political, are now becoming political.
[03:09:27.670 --> 03:09:31.850]  That's a huge move, but you are incentivized to be an uneducated voter.
[03:09:32.190 --> 03:09:33.250]  Let me ask your questions.
[03:09:33.389 --> 03:09:33.930]  They're big questions.
[03:09:34.049 --> 03:09:34.530]  Thanks for the call.
[03:09:34.729 --> 03:09:35.569]  It took me a while to answer that.
[03:09:35.569 --> 03:09:36.129]  I don't want to get more calls.
[03:09:39.690 --> 03:09:44.629]  Actually, there are polls on average 70 to 85. It's always in those ranges.
[03:09:45.350 --> 03:09:46.909]  People don't want this Ukraine war.
[03:09:47.069 --> 03:09:48.329]  They don't want their money going over there.
[03:09:48.430 --> 03:09:49.690]  Most people came and found it on a map.
[03:09:50.309 --> 03:09:57.229]  So I agree with a lot of uninformed people on a lot of issues, like the Federal Reserve being private or, you know, how...
[03:09:58.219 --> 03:09:59.299]  The Constitution works.
[03:09:59.420 --> 03:10:01.100]  I mean, there's a lot of ignorance out there.
[03:10:01.219 --> 03:10:01.899]  I mean, you're going forever.
[03:10:02.620 --> 03:10:05.200]  But people get that the Ukraine's a bunch of bull.
[03:10:05.280 --> 03:10:10.899]  And they also know the U.S. has been an empire for a long time and is out of control and we're sick of these wars decades ago.
[03:10:12.360 --> 03:10:17.280]  So, if it was just the majority not wanting war, we'd be fine.
[03:10:17.399 --> 03:10:20.920]  I mean, that's why Trump got elected, was to stop this.
[03:10:22.040 --> 03:10:29.760]  So, we have to let the politicians and companies and groups know that That we're not going to put up with all of this when they do it.
[03:10:29.959 --> 03:10:35.739]  And BlackRock's heavily invested with pension funds and government pension funds in war.
[03:10:35.739 --> 03:10:40.479]  And we go and say, we're going to pull or we're going to dump the stock if you keep doing this.
[03:10:40.579 --> 03:10:42.979]  Because Trump defense stocks were way up on him.
[03:10:43.079 --> 03:10:45.059]  He said, you can have all your new weapons and all your stuff.
[03:10:45.260 --> 03:10:46.299]  That's jobs anyways.
[03:10:46.500 --> 03:10:47.799]  And it's a strong deterrent.
[03:10:47.899 --> 03:10:52.340]  But we're not going to run around and blow up sandcastles.
[03:10:53.110 --> 03:10:59.569]  And so it's not just that we need to be isolationists like we were before World War I with the Monroe Doctrine.
[03:11:02.549 --> 03:11:09.469]  It's that we need to stop the military industrial complex and the big agencies and think tanks from starting almost always.
[03:11:09.610 --> 03:11:10.209]  I mean, here's an example.
[03:11:11.690 --> 03:11:19.629]  I don't approach Israel from, I hate Israel and I want, you know, from the mountains of the sea, get rid of Israel, okay?
[03:11:20.940 --> 03:11:24.940]  But I don't want to send money to Israel when they're per capita wealthier than we are.
[03:11:25.139 --> 03:11:26.620]  We need to take care of our home.
[03:11:26.780 --> 03:11:28.600]  So I'm against the foreign aid like Senator Paul.
[03:11:29.020 --> 03:11:44.819]  And then I go, hey, Israel helped found Hamas, and Israel stood down on October 7th, and Hamas and Hezbollah thought they were really going to take over, and Israel was quietly setting them all up.
[03:11:45.260 --> 03:11:49.399]  It's not that those groups worked for Israel, but they walked right into Israel's trap.
[03:11:50.690 --> 03:11:52.569]  And now Israel's basically wiped out all their leadership.
[03:11:53.670 --> 03:12:04.909]  Netanyahu, again, only has 17-18% of the vote, but parliamentary manipulation, just like Trudeau, just like Keir Starmer, just like Schultz and all of them, and Macron.
[03:12:05.450 --> 03:12:07.229]  I mean, they're all less than 20 points.
[03:12:08.309 --> 03:12:09.389]  They're still in power.
[03:12:09.629 --> 03:12:10.510]  Unpopular, not liked.
[03:12:11.489 --> 03:12:13.809]  Netanyahu was criminally indicted.
[03:12:14.030 --> 03:12:15.290]  These people were all in deep trouble.
[03:12:16.290 --> 03:12:19.489]  And when October 7th came and there was a clear stand-down, he said, well...
[03:12:20.370 --> 03:12:26.250]  We'll deal with why there was a stand-down once the war's over.
[03:12:26.350 --> 03:12:27.409]  Well, it's never going to end.
[03:12:27.889 --> 03:12:38.370]  So why should we be in the middle of this with a creation of Israel, with our money, destabilizing all this?
[03:12:38.409 --> 03:12:39.950]  So I'm like, okay, I'm not anti-Israel.
[03:12:40.170 --> 03:12:44.489]  I'm anti-Israel's leadership being anti-Israel.
[03:12:46.440 --> 03:12:49.540]  Israel in the 70s and 80s is declassified.
[03:12:49.760 --> 03:13:04.899]  They didn't want the Muslims to have swimming pools and condos and vibrant society, which they had everywhere until the West backed radical Islamists everywhere and took out secular, you know the Middle East was almost completely secular, rock and roll,
[03:13:05.280 --> 03:13:10.780]  Playboy magazine, women in bikinis, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, all of it.
[03:13:11.299 --> 03:13:17.219]  And the West went in there in the 40s, 50s, 70s, And knocked all those governments out.
[03:13:18.680 --> 03:13:24.860]  And I'm not saying pulling in and getting a Playboy magazine and a bottle of Jack Daniels is a sign of something perfectly good.
[03:13:25.520 --> 03:13:29.239]  I'm just saying, they were listening to country music.
[03:13:29.420 --> 03:13:31.139]  If you look it up, country music, super popular.
[03:13:31.440 --> 03:13:33.780]  Country music and Elvis and drinking Jack Daniels.
[03:13:33.920 --> 03:13:35.579]  And their wives wore bikinis.
[03:13:36.680 --> 03:13:39.520]  The West overthrew Mosaddegh.
[03:13:41.379 --> 03:13:44.559]  On record with false flag attacks in Iran in 1953, Operation Ajax.
[03:13:45.680 --> 03:13:47.420]  The point is, this is a...
[03:13:47.420 --> 03:13:49.120]  So it isn't just Israel did this.
[03:13:49.579 --> 03:13:51.659]  The United States of America did this.
[03:13:54.100 --> 03:13:56.920]  And so, that's what's done.
[03:13:57.700 --> 03:14:08.840]  And then you notice the Western governments tell you they're taking your rights to be safe from radical Islam when they bring in the Orthodox Islam and protect it and set it up.
[03:14:10.980 --> 03:14:18.120]  So, this is a sophisticated Hegelian dialectic where you set up different opposing forces and then use that crisis you set up in motion.
[03:14:18.260 --> 03:14:19.139]  You don't even totally control it.
[03:14:19.280 --> 03:14:20.620]  You just fund it and set it in motion.
[03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:25.079]  And then they model how that's going to collide, how that's going to work.
[03:14:25.379 --> 03:14:28.639]  And if it isn't exactly how they want, they'll fire up something new to get it the way they want.
[03:14:29.200 --> 03:14:30.639]  And it's not total control.
[03:14:31.879 --> 03:14:35.959]  But it's partial control, and then we sit here like naive idiots talking about it.
[03:14:36.020 --> 03:14:38.540]  So here's how I think above the third dimension.
[03:14:38.780 --> 03:14:41.079]  The average person doesn't even think two-dimensionally.
[03:14:42.340 --> 03:14:44.260]  Most of the politicians think third-dimensionally.
[03:14:44.360 --> 03:14:45.579]  I think fourth, fifth, sixth order.
[03:14:46.600 --> 03:14:51.420]  And I'm only doing third and fourth-dimensional descriptions here.
[03:14:51.540 --> 03:15:01.440]  But I come up with summations and prime computation analyses off of fourth, fifth, sixth computations in my mind.
[03:15:03.709 --> 03:15:14.149]  I see the International Criminal Court indicting Netanyahu and his former defense secretary, and I don't even look if it's legitimate.
[03:15:15.370 --> 03:15:20.329]  I say, okay, the UN's been caught starting all these wars, running giant human trafficking operations.
[03:15:21.149 --> 03:15:23.909]  They've got world treaties to take over our bodies.
[03:15:24.610 --> 03:15:26.170]  They're totally illegitimate.
[03:15:27.010 --> 03:15:33.489]  We're good to go.
[03:15:34.809 --> 03:15:43.889]  We're good to go.
[03:15:53.030 --> 03:16:08.170]  The globalists get to set up this whole anti-Israel thing, anti-Jew thing, and then they get to legitimize the UN, indicting Netanyahu for war crimes, and then that legitimizes the United Nations, and then Netanyahu gets to be the victim,
[03:16:08.309 --> 03:16:11.190]  and Netanyahu's not going to ever be at the International Criminal Court.
[03:16:12.649 --> 03:16:14.209]  So that's what's happening.
[03:16:14.670 --> 03:16:20.010]  Not, oh, I'm pro-Israel, or I'm anti-Israel, or I'm pro-Hamas, or I'm pro-Palestinian, or I'm anti-Israel.
[03:16:21.309 --> 03:16:41.110]  You've got to understand Hegelian dialectics, which are somewhat complex combinations of third-dimensional models that once you set up 6,
[03:16:41.229 --> 03:16:51.290]  7, 8, 9, 10 level collisions, It creates the permutation that goes into the next dimensions.
[03:16:52.530 --> 03:17:02.290]  But you've got to bring in culture, society, energy, life, conscious plans of globalists, subconscious plans of globalists, conscious plans of good people, subconscious plans.
[03:17:05.110 --> 03:17:12.170]  Then you have to understand the energetic, spiritual energies that are driving those programs.
[03:17:12.690 --> 03:17:15.809]  Look at it through a historical lens that you overlay.
[03:17:17.420 --> 03:17:43.420]  Understand the different factions within each group and then use a Holy Ghost inspired template using full subconscious brain power to then calculate the transmission and then raise it to conscious level and be able to articulate it.
[03:17:44.260 --> 03:17:44.819]  Alright?
[03:17:45.440 --> 03:17:50.620]  So, if people want black and white crap, you got the wrong show.
[03:17:50.799 --> 03:17:51.459]  Now, wait a minute.
[03:17:51.639 --> 03:17:53.819]  I'm not saying the universe isn't black and white.
[03:17:54.899 --> 03:17:59.739]  At its most advanced pure form, the universe is black and white.
[03:17:59.899 --> 03:18:01.159]  Is good versus evil.
[03:18:02.360 --> 03:18:10.020]  But because we're both good and evil and fallen, when the permutations collide, it creates shades of gray.
[03:18:11.879 --> 03:18:12.920]  But it is...
[03:18:14.139 --> 03:18:39.700]  The psychological, spiritual, cultural, bad guy, wizards, alchemists, are bringing those different shades of gray together and then refining it through many different collisions into the system they're building that is as black as night.
[03:18:40.260 --> 03:18:42.559]  As black as the darkest night.
[03:18:44.159 --> 03:18:47.479]  As dark as in a cave a thousand feet under the ground.
[03:18:49.360 --> 03:18:55.700]  And I was trying to think of a visual image of that.
[03:18:57.409 --> 03:19:04.069]  I would reverse the image to black around a white orb, but the black trying to extinct the orb.
[03:19:04.329 --> 03:19:12.250]  I respectfully ask you to pay attention to what I'm about to say, because it is critical in three important ways.
[03:19:12.450 --> 03:19:14.850]  It'll keep my broadcast on the air.
[03:19:15.549 --> 03:19:27.510]  It will get you the highest quality amazing CBD that's so good for your whole body, inflammation, joints, you name it, and you're getting the best deal you're going to find anywhere.
[03:19:27.790 --> 03:19:30.729]  I've been promoting and selling CBD for more than 20 years.
[03:19:30.909 --> 03:19:35.170]  Everybody knows how amazing it is, but not all CBD is equal.
[03:19:35.909 --> 03:19:48.569]  This is a high-quality, made-in-Texas, very strong CBD, 1,000-milligram tincture that has been put in nanoparticles, so it's eight to nine times stronger than regular CBD that already gives you great effects.
[03:19:49.149 --> 03:19:59.170]  On top of that, we private label it from a top company that sells it to a bunch of other companies that sell it from between $140 to $90 to $76.
[03:19:59.879 --> 03:20:06.040]  This is the lowest price you're going to find on CBD of this quality anywhere in the market.
[03:20:06.239 --> 03:20:09.020]  The industry just massively marks it up.
[03:20:09.200 --> 03:20:17.299]  There's still some good margin in here for our sponsor to support their operation and support us, and then that savings is passed on to you.

[03:21:02.159 --> 03:21:05.920]  All right, a great patriot, and a great soldier, and a great journalist.
[03:21:05.920 --> 03:21:06.959]  Scott Bennett died yesterday.
[03:21:09.129 --> 03:21:11.469]  I'm going to talk to him about that coming up, but I want to go through your calls.
[03:21:11.549 --> 03:21:15.510]  I just spent like 10 minutes on the caller because he brought really good two questions and only answered the first one.
[03:21:15.989 --> 03:21:20.110]  No one on a diatribe about it, but he says, how do we incentivize people being informed?
[03:21:20.809 --> 03:21:22.110]  People perish for lack of knowledge.
[03:21:22.250 --> 03:21:25.729]  That's as old as humanity itself, that problem and that issue.
[03:21:26.790 --> 03:21:30.930]  But I don't think the caller was completely right that most voters are dumb.
[03:21:31.829 --> 03:21:33.649]  We're all dumb to a certain extent, ignorant.
[03:21:35.899 --> 03:21:37.959]  But people are waking up.
[03:21:38.100 --> 03:21:39.280]  That's the process here.
[03:21:40.799 --> 03:21:41.479]  So...
[03:21:41.479 --> 03:21:44.399]  I answered the question.
[03:21:44.860 --> 03:21:47.860]  Jake in California on something that's really important.
[03:21:48.159 --> 03:21:55.879]  If you just tuned in, Democrats are everywhere saying they're going to resist physically Trump's lawful federal agents.
[03:21:57.299 --> 03:22:03.100]  And forces deporting these illegal aliens, the criminals, those human traffickers, all of it.
[03:22:03.379 --> 03:22:05.059]  They're saying there's going to be a tenement square.
[03:22:06.020 --> 03:22:08.000]  They're saying Trump's going to kill a bunch of people.
[03:22:08.780 --> 03:22:14.000]  And clearly they're going to just march in a bunch of leftists and then have somebody kill a bunch of them and blame it on Trump and his supporters.
[03:22:14.340 --> 03:22:20.879]  And I told you this was coming and now they're just, it's, this is what they're going to do if he gets into office on January 20th.
[03:22:21.379 --> 03:22:28.700]  And as soon as he starts executing on his promises that are totally constitutional and vital to the country surviving and never having a free and fair election again.
[03:22:31.479 --> 03:22:34.940]  So, this is a big deal.
[03:22:36.700 --> 03:22:38.440]  Jake in California, your take on that.
[03:22:39.979 --> 03:22:41.040]  Hi Alex, how's it going?
[03:22:41.180 --> 03:22:42.059]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:22:42.620 --> 03:22:42.920]  Thank you.
[03:22:44.340 --> 03:22:46.180]  So I had a couple questions for you.
[03:22:46.739 --> 03:22:47.920]  They're concerns, frankly.
[03:22:48.760 --> 03:22:54.399]  One, before President Trump gets in office, we all hope that he can make some sort of deal for peace with Russia.
[03:22:55.319 --> 03:23:15.079]  But my concern is that the deep state will try to say that he's committing something like the Logan Act or some sort of lawfare claiming to be him to be an insurrectionist by dealing with a foreign government before he's in the office.
[03:23:15.459 --> 03:23:31.489]  My second question I expect them to do whatever they can to get their agenda passed while he's in office, like they tried to do, like successfully did with the vaccine.
[03:23:31.709 --> 03:23:54.209]  But my concern now that I'm thinking about is with illegal aliens and people trying to get Trump to, like, Yeah,
[03:23:54.209 --> 03:23:55.809]  I'm really glad you called.
[03:23:56.069 --> 03:23:57.409]  I dropped the ball today.
[03:23:58.309 --> 03:23:59.530]  I didn't most days.
[03:23:59.610 --> 03:24:03.069]  I said the main thing would be start an expanded war with Russia while he's president-elect.
[03:24:03.250 --> 03:24:04.049]  That's now happened.
[03:24:04.959 --> 03:24:13.139]  And then do the racial false flag on blacks and on migrants or both, which is now they're obviously gearing up for that.
[03:24:13.260 --> 03:24:15.739]  I mean, it's as clear as the sun come up in the morning.
[03:24:15.979 --> 03:24:25.639]  And then also a new viral release, new hysteria, and this time something way worse than COVID. Yeah, so I don't know why I didn't say that.
[03:24:25.760 --> 03:24:27.620]  That's the big one.
[03:24:32.059 --> 03:24:33.420]  Does that answer your question?
[03:24:34.520 --> 03:24:49.959]  Well, yeah, I just, well, I just wanted to, I just, I was just curious to think what kind of thing they're going to try to pull with, like, trying to push in legislation as hard as they can while he's in office that's more draconian.
[03:24:51.940 --> 03:24:52.540]  Oh, yeah.
[03:24:52.719 --> 03:24:54.459]  I mean, they're going to try to co-op Trump 100%.
[03:24:55.549 --> 03:25:05.129]  And for anybody that's ever run even a small business and has like 10 employees, if they're not fully behind what you want and you don't really tell them what you want, very clearly they can't do it if they want to and are smart.
[03:25:05.389 --> 03:25:07.350]  Can you imagine Trump with all the stuff under him?
[03:25:07.430 --> 03:25:09.049]  I mean, it's very easy for these snakes.
[03:25:09.430 --> 03:25:11.690]  He's surrounded by globalist spies to get stuff done.
[03:25:11.889 --> 03:25:23.899]  That's why he's got to just purge, you know, From the top down at least 10 levels and then give very clear directives and then as soon as those people don't do what they're told that's constitutional, remove them immediately.
[03:25:24.239 --> 03:25:25.020]  Appreciate the call.
[03:25:25.770 --> 03:25:28.930]  I mean, we're not out of the woods by a long way.
[03:25:29.729 --> 03:25:34.649]  I mean, again, it's not like some utopia getting Trump elected, but it shows the power of the corporate media is broken.
[03:25:34.889 --> 03:25:37.850]  It shows their corporate media and their corporate money and donations.
[03:25:38.069 --> 03:25:42.950]  You know, 95% or 94% to Kamala Harris didn't work.
[03:25:43.110 --> 03:25:45.750]  So what it shows is people are waking up and they don't like the New World Order.
[03:25:46.430 --> 03:25:48.110]  And there's major pushback around the planet.
[03:25:48.510 --> 03:25:53.389]  Now, it doesn't mean they're giving up and it doesn't mean we don't have big problems to deal with.
[03:25:54.560 --> 03:25:56.239]  So many people are euphoric.
[03:25:56.299 --> 03:25:56.959]  Everything's solved.
[03:25:57.139 --> 03:25:57.680]  No, it's not.
[03:25:58.500 --> 03:25:59.459]  Dennis in Florida.
[03:25:59.459 --> 03:26:00.040]  You're on the air.
[03:26:00.139 --> 03:26:00.379]  Go ahead.
[03:26:01.719 --> 03:26:02.319]  Hi, Alex.
[03:26:02.440 --> 03:26:05.180]  It's the highest honor in the world to speak to you in the audience.
[03:26:05.719 --> 03:26:07.639]  We're in a terrible position, as you know.
[03:26:07.959 --> 03:26:09.819]  Trump, they tried to kill him twice.
[03:26:10.700 --> 03:26:12.799]  They're trying to start a nuclear war right now.
[03:26:13.349 --> 03:26:14.989]  Lord only knows what they're going to do next.
[03:26:15.129 --> 03:26:15.850]  They will do anything.
[03:26:16.030 --> 03:26:19.870]  I think Trump has to take control of the military and intelligence community right now.
[03:26:20.209 --> 03:26:24.049]  I think they will fall behind him if he calls upon them to in light of what's been occurring.
[03:26:24.610 --> 03:26:27.270]  And then he just has to take control now.
[03:26:27.430 --> 03:26:28.149]  There's no other option.
[03:26:28.149 --> 03:26:29.110]  Well, let me stop you.
[03:26:29.270 --> 03:26:30.149]  Let me stop you.
[03:26:30.270 --> 03:26:31.030]  A, I agree with you.
[03:26:32.530 --> 03:26:33.709]  But you have to look at optics.
[03:26:34.190 --> 03:26:37.069]  So Trump would have to say Kamala Harris was illegitimate.
[03:26:37.719 --> 03:26:41.260]  Kamala Harris was installed as the candidate.
[03:26:41.979 --> 03:26:44.620]  That was illegal, but he didn't do it then.
[03:26:44.799 --> 03:26:45.879]  He pointed out, it was bull.
[03:26:46.639 --> 03:26:57.719]  And the constitutional mechanism to do this is your 25th Amendment, Biden for attacking Russia and violating the War Powers Act, which is illegal and cut and dry.
[03:26:57.940 --> 03:27:01.680]  You can have like a day-long indictment in the House, day-long trial in the Senate.
[03:27:03.389 --> 03:27:04.409]  And then you remove him.
[03:27:04.549 --> 03:27:05.690]  People say, oh no, Kamala will be there.
[03:27:05.829 --> 03:27:06.549]  No, under the amendment.
[03:27:06.829 --> 03:27:09.129]  Then it goes to Congress to decide what to do.
[03:27:09.270 --> 03:27:14.770]  And we say, because he's 25th Amendment, because she was illegitimate, you remove them.
[03:27:14.850 --> 03:27:31.569]  And even if that doesn't happen, you take control of the narrative in the next 56 days and put them on the defense, and you haul up the Secretary of State and the head of the CIA that are really in charge and launch these attacks on Russia, and Congress removes them.
[03:27:32.709 --> 03:27:34.950]  So it's Congress that would do that.
[03:27:35.110 --> 03:27:37.010]  It's Congress that would impeach cabinet officials.
[03:27:38.090 --> 03:27:40.969]  And so we are in a coup.
[03:27:41.229 --> 03:27:47.069]  You have to admit we're in a coup that has a nuclear war gun to our head and the open border gun to our head.
[03:27:47.250 --> 03:27:49.409]  Biden is saying everybody can come in now, no controls.
[03:27:50.069 --> 03:27:51.170]  So that right there.
[03:27:51.809 --> 03:27:52.569]  So, yeah.
[03:27:52.770 --> 03:27:54.790]  But I mean, the question is, how do you do that?
[03:27:54.790 --> 03:27:57.309]  Because I agree, in the next 56 days...
[03:27:58.709 --> 03:28:00.850]  I'll get John Podesta down in Brazil.
[03:28:01.209 --> 03:28:02.129]  I wonder what he was doing.
[03:28:02.709 --> 03:28:04.350]  You know, it's on his laptop.
[03:28:05.569 --> 03:28:06.010]  Literally.
[03:28:06.889 --> 03:28:11.649]  So, yeah, we are in the thick of the battle now.
[03:28:12.450 --> 03:28:14.010]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[03:28:15.239 --> 03:28:21.360]  Yeah, it's just that, Alex, I think that they're going to pull something that's going to make those legal mechanisms irrelevant.
[03:28:21.639 --> 03:28:23.059]  And they could do it at any moment.
[03:28:23.219 --> 03:28:25.399]  We're living under the sword of Damocles right now.
[03:28:25.520 --> 03:28:29.319]  But once Trump gets power, the next thing is going to be, we've got to free the world from the elite.
[03:28:29.500 --> 03:28:31.579]  And that requires a plan to go against theirs.
[03:28:31.819 --> 03:28:35.159]  I'm the author of the plan for New America and the Global Republic.
[03:28:35.360 --> 03:28:37.020]  People have heard about that around the world now.
[03:28:37.159 --> 03:28:39.420]  And I should come on the show to discuss this, Alex.
[03:28:39.659 --> 03:28:43.409]  We need to have 10 America's The way the founders intended it.
[03:28:43.629 --> 03:28:45.049]  And we can get there quickly.
[03:28:45.149 --> 03:28:48.809]  And the people of Russia and China will fall behind this in no time.
[03:28:49.010 --> 03:28:51.389]  We just have got to get Trump in power now.
[03:28:51.469 --> 03:28:53.530]  Well, I mean, I don't know about your plan, but you can tell me about it briefly.
[03:28:53.670 --> 03:28:55.709]  But I call it 1776 worldwide.
[03:28:55.709 --> 03:28:56.690]  I've been sitting there for 20 years.
[03:28:57.069 --> 03:28:59.229]  We don't take over the world with force.
[03:28:59.670 --> 03:29:01.370]  We don't actually run the other countries.
[03:29:01.569 --> 03:29:04.250]  The idea of liberty is so sexy and everybody wants it.
[03:29:04.389 --> 03:29:09.149]  By being a true, free, open country, by what we stand for, the world will adopt it.
[03:29:09.370 --> 03:29:11.430]  And that's 1776 worldwide.
[03:29:12.569 --> 03:29:13.010]  Absolutely.
[03:29:13.010 --> 03:29:14.190]  I totally agree with that.
[03:29:14.290 --> 03:29:16.469]  I should come on the show and talk about this.
[03:29:16.709 --> 03:29:17.649]  Sure, you said that.
[03:29:17.850 --> 03:29:20.329]  Tell me the name of your plan, and then where do I read it?
[03:29:20.450 --> 03:29:23.690]  The plans for New America and the Global Republic.
[03:29:23.690 --> 03:29:26.010]  It's totally censored on Google.
[03:29:26.250 --> 03:29:33.170]  You'll see my name, Dennis R. Torrey Jr., T-O-R-I-I. But I believe that it's getting some traction.
[03:29:33.430 --> 03:29:34.969]  People on the left even like it.
[03:29:35.110 --> 03:29:36.590]  We know the founders were correct.
[03:29:36.690 --> 03:29:37.809]  We've got to reverse this.
[03:29:38.000 --> 03:29:46.299]  And the way we get there is with Trump, a convention of states to reset the Constitution, expand America at that point after we finish the wall, and make nine more.
[03:29:46.299 --> 03:29:49.500]  The way that the founders would intend it is pure common sense.
[03:29:49.659 --> 03:29:51.860]  Then we can handle the fiscal...
[03:29:51.860 --> 03:29:52.559]  No, I hear you.
[03:29:52.700 --> 03:29:53.659]  I gotta jump in.
[03:29:53.739 --> 03:29:54.319]  Let's get to other callers.
[03:29:54.379 --> 03:29:54.600]  Thank you.
[03:29:55.420 --> 03:29:56.420]  Jesse in Texas.
[03:29:56.600 --> 03:29:56.879]  Go ahead.
[03:29:58.420 --> 03:29:59.159]  Hi, Alex.
[03:29:59.379 --> 03:30:00.280]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:30:00.579 --> 03:30:01.719]  I'd like to say a prayer.
[03:30:06.870 --> 03:30:07.229]  All right.
[03:30:07.950 --> 03:30:12.309]  Heavenly Father, we come before you today with humility, faith, seeking your divine guidance and mercy.
[03:30:12.649 --> 03:30:14.370]  We lift up Alex Jones to you.
[03:30:14.469 --> 03:30:16.829]  May he find clarity, wisdom, and truth in his endeavors.
[03:30:17.350 --> 03:30:22.649]  Grant him strength to promote goodness and justice, and let his word bring light in where there is darkness.
[03:30:23.250 --> 03:30:26.790]  Lead him in your ways that his voice may inspire understanding and healing in this world.
[03:30:27.110 --> 03:30:32.030]  We pray for our President-elect Donald Trump as he prepares to take on the immense responsibility of leading our nation.
[03:30:32.469 --> 03:30:34.329]  Grant him wisdom, humility, and strength.
[03:30:34.690 --> 03:30:37.090]  Guide his decisions to reflect your justice and compassion.
[03:30:37.430 --> 03:30:40.969]  And help him work out unity, peace, and prosperity for all.
[03:30:41.569 --> 03:30:44.530]  May he seek your counsel in all things and govern with the heart of service.
[03:30:45.170 --> 03:30:47.069]  We also pray for peace across the earth.
[03:30:47.450 --> 03:31:21.930]  In these uncertain times, we ask your hand guide the hearts of leaders and nations, quench the fires of anger and division, and help us walk Thank
[03:31:21.930 --> 03:31:22.950]  you so much, brother.
[03:31:24.180 --> 03:31:26.659]  All right, I want to get to all the other callers.
[03:31:26.940 --> 03:31:28.360]  I'm going to come in tomorrow at 2 p.m.
[03:31:28.639 --> 03:31:29.500]  Central, 3 p.m.
[03:31:29.659 --> 03:31:29.719]  Eastern.
[03:31:29.940 --> 03:31:31.200]  I'm going to do a two-hour show at least.
[03:31:31.520 --> 03:31:32.540]  I will take calls.
[03:31:32.540 --> 03:31:36.959]  If you want to give us your numbers, callers, I'll call you back tomorrow at about 3 o'clock.
[03:31:37.020 --> 03:31:38.559]  I should take calls in the second hour.
[03:31:39.079 --> 03:31:40.000]  We'll have some special guests.
[03:31:40.120 --> 03:31:40.840]  A lot more tomorrow.
[03:31:41.639 --> 03:31:45.780]  I've got some final things I need to hit in the last 16 minutes before Owen takes over with the war room.
[03:31:45.860 --> 03:31:47.120]  Remember, every day here is precious.
[03:31:47.360 --> 03:31:52.440]  We literally have the Justice Department illegally trying to shut us twice in the last six months.
[03:31:52.440 --> 03:31:53.459]  They just tried last week.
[03:31:53.559 --> 03:31:54.340]  We're here in the studios.
[03:31:54.340 --> 03:31:56.260]  It was all a lie, all a hoax.
[03:31:56.420 --> 03:31:58.299]  The judge caught it, said no way.
[03:31:58.620 --> 03:32:03.299]  Unless they get to him or something happens, we're sure of good buyers being able to come and we stay here.
[03:32:03.799 --> 03:32:10.040]  But it has been crippling that almost no one's buying anything at Infowars store.
[03:32:11.090 --> 03:32:15.209]  And then a lot of folks aren't getting stuff at the Alex Jones store because they think the Onion owns it.
[03:32:15.930 --> 03:32:17.290]  Your orders get ordered.
[03:32:17.469 --> 03:32:18.549]  You go to InfoWareStore.com.
[03:32:18.629 --> 03:32:19.049]  Great products.
[03:32:19.170 --> 03:32:19.809]  You get them shipped out.
[03:32:19.989 --> 03:32:21.149]  The judges are going to let them do this.
[03:32:21.489 --> 03:32:25.090]  Even if they weren't able to take it over, the judges already say they're going to order them to ship the stuff and finish it.
[03:32:26.809 --> 03:32:30.270]  But see, by them doing that, they thought that would make everybody just go away.
[03:32:30.430 --> 03:32:31.209]  That's what they said.
[03:32:32.770 --> 03:32:34.549]  If you don't want to go to InfoWareStore, I get it.
[03:32:37.109 --> 03:32:42.770]  But the Alex Jones store will fund the new network and is paying the money that keeps Infowars on the air.
[03:32:42.930 --> 03:32:51.510]  So because Infowars store has collapsed, we would need to increase the money coming into the Alex Jones store.com in case Infowars survives, which I just give it about a 95% chance.
[03:32:52.170 --> 03:32:53.850]  That's what I believe in the current trajectory.
[03:32:54.629 --> 03:32:57.829]  But 100% with the Alex Jones store, because I don't own that, they have no claim on it.
[03:32:59.130 --> 03:33:02.850]  So, go to thealexjonesstore.com, get the fundraiser posters.
[03:33:03.090 --> 03:33:04.209]  They got a nice markup on them.
[03:33:04.290 --> 03:33:10.489]  If you really want to donate something, I know you supported us, have a memento of what you did as a Paul Revere, then that's what you really need to get.
[03:33:10.489 --> 03:33:13.350]  And the fundraiser info-wear shirt that's got extra markup in it.
[03:33:13.670 --> 03:33:20.950]  We make some, you know, all the supplements and all the other t-shirts, but the fundraiser stuff, you know, has a big markup, so some real money comes in.
[03:33:21.170 --> 03:33:23.090]  So that's at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:33:23.729 --> 03:33:25.129]  I want to thank all you that have become...
[03:33:27.870 --> 03:33:32.129]  VIP members, you get $40 a month when you're a VIP member for $30.
[03:33:32.590 --> 03:33:34.590]  It's a recurring charge, cancel any time.
[03:33:34.750 --> 03:33:36.709]  You get special deals, even bigger discounts.
[03:33:36.909 --> 03:33:40.149]  But that shirt that's red on navy blue, that's $50.
[03:33:41.309 --> 03:33:42.750]  That way, we get...
[03:33:46.060 --> 03:33:46.380]  $25.
[03:33:46.380 --> 03:33:49.680]  Because, you know, these shirts are quality, and they're done right there in Arkansas.
[03:33:49.899 --> 03:33:51.840]  So an XXL is like $17.
[03:33:52.180 --> 03:33:55.180]  A small is like $14 just for the cost of the shirt.
[03:33:55.340 --> 03:33:58.059]  Then our sponsor gets some of the money, and then we get some of the money.
[03:33:58.159 --> 03:34:00.020]  So a shirt for $30, we're getting like $6, $7.
[03:34:00.930 --> 03:34:02.729]  Which, you know, you saw a lot of shirts do that.
[03:34:02.909 --> 03:34:08.170]  So we have the fundraiser shirt, and people have really been getting it, so you know some real money comes in here.
[03:34:08.530 --> 03:34:09.010]  All right?
[03:34:09.850 --> 03:34:11.790]  The supplements and stuff are very competitively priced.
[03:34:11.950 --> 03:34:12.750]  You're blown away by them.
[03:34:12.850 --> 03:34:13.370]  People love them.
[03:34:13.430 --> 03:34:14.270]  Then you come back and get them.
[03:34:14.309 --> 03:34:15.110]  We want that relationship.
[03:34:15.909 --> 03:34:22.030]  But it's the posters, they're limited edition, and it's the fundraiser shirts.
[03:34:22.149 --> 03:34:24.690]  There's two of them out of hundreds that are really what you should do.
[03:34:24.829 --> 03:34:25.569]  Thank you for your support.
[03:34:25.729 --> 03:34:26.010]  All right.
[03:34:27.030 --> 03:34:27.790]  I'm done plugging.
[03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:29.110]  But...
[03:34:30.090 --> 03:34:34.149]  We're fighting, we're winning, but damn the PSYOP of those people.
[03:34:34.930 --> 03:34:36.030]  This is disgusting.
[03:34:36.270 --> 03:34:36.790]  I'm suing them.
[03:34:42.010 --> 03:34:45.209]  Now let me talk about Scott Bennett.
[03:34:45.709 --> 03:34:49.829]  I've been interviewing Scott Bennett for at least a decade.
[03:34:50.950 --> 03:34:52.870]  And he was in Army Intelligence.
[03:34:54.450 --> 03:34:56.469]  And he was a great patriot.
[03:34:57.969 --> 03:35:01.950]  And he also was a combat journalist as well, different combat zones.
[03:35:02.909 --> 03:35:09.569]  And he was a big whistleblower, Army Special Operations Officer, psychological warfare analyst, and author.
[03:35:10.149 --> 03:35:13.989]  And we've been trying to get him on for weeks, and usually he'd get back with us in hours.
[03:35:14.930 --> 03:35:17.930]  And then we got a call yesterday morning from his friend at the hospital.
[03:35:18.010 --> 03:35:19.170]  They said he's got pancreatic cancer.
[03:35:19.170 --> 03:35:19.809]  He's dying.
[03:35:22.549 --> 03:35:25.329]  And he died yesterday afternoon.
[03:35:27.260 --> 03:35:31.399]  So, I'm going to take a compilation of some of the interviews we did with him and put that on X today.
[03:35:32.479 --> 03:35:35.120]  At some point next week, we're going to air some of it here on air.
[03:35:36.200 --> 03:35:38.079]  But, he's in the Lord's hands.
[03:35:38.079 --> 03:35:42.899]  He was a great Christian, a strong man, and two years younger than me.
[03:35:44.020 --> 03:35:45.260]  Or four years younger than me.
[03:35:47.040 --> 03:35:54.840]  Dead at 46. And he did not look good when I saw him back in mid-July because I was there to cover Bohemian Grove.
[03:35:55.120 --> 03:35:56.100]  Folks infiltrated it.
[03:35:56.200 --> 03:35:56.860]  We got new footage.
[03:35:57.600 --> 03:36:00.540]  So I was out in California for a few days when Trump first got shot.
[03:36:00.639 --> 03:36:01.440]  He was in San Francisco.
[03:36:01.440 --> 03:36:01.959]  He drove up.
[03:36:02.040 --> 03:36:02.600]  I interviewed him.
[03:36:03.920 --> 03:36:05.799]  And he was there in person.
[03:36:06.659 --> 03:36:09.120]  We weren't sitting side by side because I was across the table from him.
[03:36:09.159 --> 03:36:09.819]  I had a limited setup.
[03:36:10.559 --> 03:36:14.299]  But I'm glad I got to have dinner with him and drink a cup of coffee with him.
[03:36:14.700 --> 03:36:15.579]  A real gentleman.
[03:36:15.819 --> 03:36:16.639]  And we love you.
[03:36:18.209 --> 03:36:18.829]  Scott Bennett.
[03:36:19.469 --> 03:36:25.290]  So here's a couple short clips that I want to get to of Scott Bennett.
[03:36:26.069 --> 03:36:32.469]  And that's clip 19 and 20. And then I'll come out, come back with some final comments.
[03:36:32.590 --> 03:36:33.950]  But Viacondios, brother, we love you.
[03:36:37.020 --> 03:36:39.600]  This is a legal affidavit, an oral affidavit.
[03:36:39.739 --> 03:36:45.719]  My name is Scott Bennett, former United States Army officer, State Department counterterrorism analyst.
[03:36:46.200 --> 03:36:58.360]  This is an affidavit testifying that the area behind me is the place that was struck, the apartment complex, the civilian housing structure that was struck by American and NATO weapons.
[03:36:58.940 --> 03:37:00.260]  These are civilian targets.
[03:37:00.479 --> 03:37:01.959]  These are not military targets.
[03:37:02.340 --> 03:37:04.379]  As such, this is an act of terrorism.
[03:37:04.700 --> 03:37:14.340]  This is an act of intentional terrorism meant, designed, and orchestrated to exercise political extortion upon the Russian Federation.
[03:37:15.510 --> 03:37:24.170]  As such, this is an act in violation of the United States Constitution, the United States laws, the laws of the several states.
[03:37:24.489 --> 03:37:29.370]  This is also a violation of the United Nations Charter, as well as the laws of war.
[03:37:29.670 --> 03:37:46.549]  This is an affidavit that will be sent to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Senate Speaker Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, And as such, this is a notice that it must cease and desist,
[03:37:46.649 --> 03:37:55.329]  the civilian targeting, using American and NATO weapons, or else failure to cease and desist, will constitute a continuation of war crimes.
[03:37:57.250 --> 03:37:58.770]  This is another angle.
[03:37:59.010 --> 03:38:10.409]  Just look at the internal world of these people that was suddenly shattered on this first floor, and then above them the second floor, and the third, and the fourth, and the fifth.
[03:38:12.520 --> 03:38:13.500]  You have books.
[03:38:14.000 --> 03:38:15.639]  You have towels.
[03:38:17.219 --> 03:38:19.219]  You have toys.
[03:38:19.540 --> 03:38:23.020]  You have cookie boxes.
[03:38:23.920 --> 03:38:25.879]  You have ironing boards.
[03:38:27.680 --> 03:38:29.360]  You have art.
[03:38:29.959 --> 03:38:31.459]  You have pictures.
[03:38:32.659 --> 03:38:35.219]  All of this shattered in an explosion.
[03:38:36.850 --> 03:38:39.569]  An explosion done by NATO weapons.
[03:38:40.170 --> 03:38:48.229]  All of these people that have been in power for the last five years have brought nothing but ruin to Europe and the United States.
[03:38:48.469 --> 03:38:59.340]  And I think the people are going to be rising up to overthrow them because these individuals, these parties, They are incapable of change.
[03:38:59.559 --> 03:39:01.180]  They're incapable of compromise.
[03:39:01.180 --> 03:39:03.219]  They're incapable of humility.
[03:39:03.579 --> 03:39:18.340]  They're incapable of recognizing Russia's just and reasonable demands and expectations to preserve its own security by denying NATO an invasion point.
[03:39:19.010 --> 03:39:41.510]  The current military globalist industrial complex is incapable of compromise and appreciating that perspective, which means it inevitably may initiate some sort of a aggressive warlike maneuver that will only result in the destruction and weakening of the West.
[03:39:41.709 --> 03:39:59.360]  The key is to understand the degree of Response, the degree of military engagement that Russia would allow itself to engage in towards the West.
[03:39:59.700 --> 03:40:22.129]  Rather than nuclear weapons, I think it's much more effective to use non-nuclear weapons in order to win the hearts and minds of the European and American people and to brand This entire situation as Russia is not looking to conquer the world.
[03:40:22.510 --> 03:40:43.510]  Russia is looking to liberate the American and European peoples who have been conquered and enslaved by their fraudulent politicians that have meddled in their elections, stolen the elections, and enslaved the people to this agenda of endless war and the destruction of their own economies.
[03:40:44.190 --> 03:40:45.450]  This is the tyrant.
[03:40:45.649 --> 03:40:46.729]  It is not Russia.
[03:40:46.729 --> 03:40:53.709]  It is the tyranny of the West's own politicians, media, and government that has oppressed the people.
[03:40:53.889 --> 03:41:13.510]  And if Russia is able to effectively market that and brand that and share that within the BRICS communities and target that within the European countries and the American countries, I think it will be very, very effective to winning popular support among the Western people.
[03:41:14.059 --> 03:41:22.979]  So it's complicated, but at the same time, I think Russia understands how to appropriately handle it.
[03:41:24.100 --> 03:41:35.700]  Now, we're live on air at 2.53 and 35 seconds central time, but I'm going to take this little intro and those clips and put it on a 30-minute excerpts of other interviews with him.
[03:41:35.780 --> 03:41:37.180]  He predicted the Trump landslide.
[03:41:38.379 --> 03:41:47.159]  He predicted that, I remember on the show last time in the Californian person, that the danger would be once he was president-elect, they would try to escalate the war.
[03:41:47.239 --> 03:41:49.639]  I mean, these are really easy things to do when you study all this.
[03:41:50.319 --> 03:41:53.500]  And we're trying to make it easy for everybody else to understand the bad guy's next move.
[03:41:53.659 --> 03:41:54.639]  So Scott's a great guy.
[03:41:54.819 --> 03:41:55.500]  He lives on forever.
[03:41:55.879 --> 03:41:57.059]  And his spirit lives forever.
[03:41:57.059 --> 03:41:58.700]  So we love you, Mr. Bennett.
[03:42:00.399 --> 03:42:02.899]  I'm going to end the show here in just a few minutes.
[03:42:04.040 --> 03:42:07.139]  And like I told you, these are epic times.
[03:42:08.700 --> 03:42:12.340]  We are under major attack because we're effective and tell the truth.
[03:42:12.899 --> 03:42:14.659]  And I have total faith in God.
[03:42:16.290 --> 03:42:18.270]  That he will provide here.
[03:42:18.729 --> 03:42:24.850]  But I just cannot express to people enough that if you think we're out of the woods with Trump's victory, think again.
[03:42:25.190 --> 03:42:27.729]  And I've seen a lot of euphoria and people deserve a victory.
[03:42:28.030 --> 03:42:41.889]  But you win a massive battle, you turn the tide, the enemy counteroffensives, and I've got more articles and more coming in that the deep state is going to false flag and blame Trump supporters for attacking migrants.
[03:42:42.149 --> 03:42:43.409]  That's for sure.
[03:42:44.250 --> 03:42:49.250]  Unless we have such an awakening to this that they know nobody's going to buy it.
[03:42:49.930 --> 03:42:51.510]  But they still go ahead with stuff.
[03:42:51.610 --> 03:42:53.790]  They thought we'd buy Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.
[03:42:54.569 --> 03:42:55.770]  So, look at these headlines.
[03:42:55.950 --> 03:42:57.549]  Russian hypersonic warning to the West.
[03:42:57.790 --> 03:42:58.870]  Told you that was what it was.
[03:42:59.389 --> 03:43:01.030]  Threatens American base in Poland.
[03:43:01.149 --> 03:43:02.069]  UK ready for war.
[03:43:03.909 --> 03:43:05.030]  Bird flu pandemic.
[03:43:05.370 --> 03:43:07.030]  They're now hyping this everywhere in the New York Post.
[03:43:07.229 --> 03:43:10.290]  Could be 100 times worse than COVID. Scientists warns they're getting ready for that.
[03:43:12.190 --> 03:43:12.989]  It's just...
[03:43:12.989 --> 03:43:16.770]  We're out of the frying pan into the fire here at this point.
[03:43:16.909 --> 03:43:18.129]  And it is so critical.
[03:43:18.329 --> 03:43:19.389]  I mean, do you need me to tell you that?
[03:43:19.450 --> 03:43:20.030]  No, you know that.
[03:43:20.409 --> 03:43:22.409]  That this broadcast stay on air.
[03:43:23.870 --> 03:43:32.709]  And I cannot thank people enough for your word of mouth and your prayer and your support at thealexhamstore.com and my dad's great company, drjonesadvils.com.
[03:43:32.829 --> 03:43:33.870]  And in closing on that point...
[03:43:35.899 --> 03:43:42.520]  Everybody, I think, knows how great quercetin is and CoQ10 for cleaning out your cells, your immune system, your whole body.
[03:43:43.639 --> 03:43:45.600]  It's so good for energy, everything.
[03:43:46.620 --> 03:43:51.239]  Good quercetin and quality quercetin, quality CoQ10 are just magic.
[03:43:52.000 --> 03:43:55.840]  If you don't know about it, I don't know if you've been hiding under a rock, but you should go look into it.
[03:43:56.850 --> 03:44:00.610]  Good quercetin and good CoQ10 is $60 to $100.
[03:44:00.809 --> 03:44:03.770]  This is expensive to get the good stuff from top brands.
[03:44:04.549 --> 03:44:11.170]  My dad at drjonesdaptorals.com has a top brand private label that actually a pharmaceutical company makes.
[03:44:11.409 --> 03:44:13.049]  This is his private label.
[03:44:14.670 --> 03:44:17.350]  And this is one of the top rated ones, private label by him.
[03:44:18.549 --> 03:44:19.770]  And it's 40% off.
[03:44:19.870 --> 03:44:20.149]  It's $30.
[03:44:21.309 --> 03:44:21.809]  Okay?
[03:44:22.750 --> 03:44:24.190]  You can get both of them.
[03:44:25.659 --> 03:44:27.159]  As well together in a combo pack.
[03:44:27.760 --> 03:44:32.280]  Everybody should be on Corsetin and on CoQ10 year-round, especially in the winter.
[03:44:33.219 --> 03:44:35.979]  Everybody should take it as a preventative, plus it's so good for your whole body.
[03:44:36.639 --> 03:44:42.680]  Get your Corsetin and CoQ10 for 40% off, high quality, at drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:44:43.260 --> 03:44:46.000]  DR for doctor, drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:44:46.559 --> 03:44:47.459]  And again, I'm just here.
[03:44:48.780 --> 03:44:50.479]  I was feeling good two weeks ago.
[03:44:50.819 --> 03:44:53.299]  Had enough funds, but not a bunch of extra.
[03:44:54.059 --> 03:44:57.239]  And now, People just, oh, you're off the air.
[03:44:57.379 --> 03:45:00.139]  Oh, you're on air, but you're off, and they own you, so I'm not going to give them the money.
[03:45:00.399 --> 03:45:02.260]  My dad's company's not owned by them.
[03:45:02.280 --> 03:45:03.100]  He's our big sponsor.
[03:45:03.719 --> 03:45:05.899]  The AlexJonesStore.com is not owned by them.
[03:45:05.899 --> 03:45:06.620]  It's the sponsor.
[03:45:06.739 --> 03:45:08.040]  That's keeping us on the air right now.
[03:45:08.579 --> 03:45:10.340]  So, we got shortfalls.
[03:45:10.500 --> 03:45:11.860]  I need your support right now.
[03:45:12.459 --> 03:45:16.280]  Because I hate begging, but I hate losing, and these enemies winning a lot more.
[03:45:17.280 --> 03:45:17.740]  More.
[03:45:17.740 --> 03:45:20.639]  So, to the millions of you watching, this is the real world.
[03:45:20.940 --> 03:45:22.059]  I need your support.
[03:45:22.159 --> 03:45:22.899]  You need my support.
[03:45:23.159 --> 03:45:24.139]  Take action now.
[03:45:24.559 --> 03:45:26.319]  Alright, Owen Schroyer is a load of her bear.
[03:45:26.420 --> 03:45:27.360]  He takes over now.
[03:45:29.120 --> 03:45:31.059]  Here's the facts in 60 seconds.
[03:45:31.319 --> 03:45:36.219]  The Justice Department came into my bankruptcy and tried to shut us down twice since May.
[03:45:36.479 --> 03:45:38.040]  The latest case was last week.
[03:45:38.790 --> 03:45:39.870]  The judge shut them down.
[03:45:40.049 --> 03:45:40.930]  They were thrown out of the building.
[03:45:41.409 --> 03:45:42.270]  Crimes were committed.
[03:45:42.569 --> 03:45:43.229]  It's very clear.
[03:45:43.409 --> 03:45:44.129]  They're in a lot of trouble.
[03:45:44.370 --> 03:45:45.969]  I've filed counter lawsuits.
[03:45:46.370 --> 03:45:47.250]  You name it.
[03:45:48.170 --> 03:45:49.569]  Infowarsstore.com is in limbo.
[03:45:49.690 --> 03:45:51.350]  If you order there, you'll get your products.
[03:45:51.809 --> 03:46:05.629]  But thealexjonesstore.com is our great sponsors in Arkansas with t-shirts and great supplements that are funding not just Infowars, but the Alex Jones Network in case this gets shut down at another hearing next week.
[03:46:05.889 --> 03:46:09.610]  So, a lot of people Aren't going to thealexjonesstore.com right now.
[03:46:09.709 --> 03:46:12.290]  We're getting messages, oh, we don't want to give money to The Onion.
[03:46:12.569 --> 03:46:18.569]  The Onion didn't get InfoWars, and they don't own Alex Jones, and they don't own the Alex Jones Network.
[03:46:18.729 --> 03:46:19.610]  I don't even own that.
[03:46:19.690 --> 03:46:20.430]  It's the sponsor.

[03:46:38.479 --> 03:46:43.159]  Over the weekend, folks, we saw our funds cut in half, and people told us, well, we don't want to give it to The Onion.
[03:46:43.360 --> 03:46:45.040]  The Onion does not own me.
[03:46:45.180 --> 03:46:48.500]  They do not own thealexjonesstore.com.
