[00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:28.476]  It's Saturday, September 7th, 2024.
[00:00:30.017 --> 00:00:36.260]  I am your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting worldwide from our embattled studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:52.649]  It's 134 days, 21 hours, 59 minutes until President Trump would be inaugurated, because it's those 76 days between him being president-elect and being sworn in on the south sides of the Capitol that will be the most critical.
[00:00:53.732 --> 00:00:56.493]  Unfortunately, almost no one else but us is talking about that.
[00:00:58.073 --> 00:01:04.615]  My goal is not to be the guy that is right most often and everybody else doesn't know what they're doing.
[00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:07.216]  I'm trying to get people to understand we're dialed in.
[00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:09.576]  This is all I do is study the new world order.
[00:01:10.897 --> 00:01:16.218]  And we've got the most accurate history and accurate prediction rate out there.
[00:01:16.478 --> 00:01:17.739]  And we still do.
[00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:22.540]  And there's a lot of people smarter than me that just need to get my perspective, my understanding, which they can do.
[00:01:24.087 --> 00:01:27.610]  Put on the glasses like they live, and they'll see it even better than I do.
[00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:30.812]  It's starting to happen, but not fast enough.
[00:01:30.973 --> 00:01:36.417]  All right, I want to thank the crew for coming in on this live Saturday broadcast.
[00:01:37.438 --> 00:01:53.411]  It is 102 Central Standard Time, and we're going to be here live for the next two hours at Infowars.com forward slash show on radio and TV stations across the country, man.video, and of course, Real Alex Jones on X.
[00:01:54.997 --> 00:02:04.704]  Now, in the first hour, I'm going to take questions from the real Alex Jones subscribers that they sent in for an Ask Me Anything.
[00:02:04.904 --> 00:02:10.849]  Small note, we have all these encoders and satellites and systems, and they tested it yesterday and it worked fine.
[00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:21.277]  We were trying to just send a stream of subscribers to go live from noon to one with the Ask Me Anything, and then I was going to re-air it after I did a live show after that today.
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.861]  At 2 p.m.
[00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:27.583]  I was going to go live, cover other big breaking news, and then air that so everybody can see it.
[00:02:27.983 --> 00:02:31.346]  But I was going to do it just for the subscribers live, just to them first.
[00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:32.947]  It had an encoder issue.
[00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:34.207]  It took about 20 minutes to fix it.
[00:02:34.247 --> 00:02:36.249]  I said, listen, we'll work the bugs out.
[00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.790]  I'm going to start doing more stuff just for subscribers in the near future.
[00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:41.772]  They want to see their stuff read to the public.
[00:02:41.792 --> 00:02:42.753]  These are great questions.
[00:02:43.273 --> 00:02:45.194]  And so I was going to air it anyways for everybody.
[00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:46.875]  So we're getting it done right now.
[00:02:48.476 --> 00:02:49.977]  Now, that said, these are great questions.
[00:02:50.037 --> 00:02:50.798]  I'm going to do these first.
[00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:58.304]  But then in the second hour, it'll easily take me an hour to go over these great questions and they're excellent.
[00:02:59.864 --> 00:03:00.484]  They're all good.
[00:03:02.245 --> 00:03:02.865]  Quote the bad one.
[00:03:05.206 --> 00:03:10.469]  Which shouldn't be a surprise, this is the most hardcore supporters that are the subscribers on Real Alex Jones.
[00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:18.332]  The news I have on COVID is undoubtedly the biggest yet.
[00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:23.778]  Now I want to be clear, when you hear all this in the second hour, you're going to go, wait a minute, we already heard this.
[00:03:25.598 --> 00:03:46.966]  Well, you didn't hear all of it, and now a bunch of prestigious scientists, virologists, epidemiologists, cancer doctors, oncologists, you name it, in major peer-reviewed studies everywhere,
[00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.701]  Are confirming this four years into the poison injections.
[00:03:52.081 --> 00:03:52.961]  Almost four years in.
[00:03:55.703 --> 00:04:10.871]  And I'm gonna play a clip before I get to these new findings that we've been playing for over three years of the chief scientist over the British agency slash private conglomerate, Dr. David Bauer, saying in 2021,
[00:04:17.165 --> 00:04:19.066]  That the shots turn off your immune system.
[00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.549]  Now why the hell would you want to turn your immune system off to something?
[00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:24.989]  Not just COVID, but everything.
[00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.970]  Bacteria, other viruses.
[00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.874]  But there have been major discoveries hiding in plain view and new ones that back it up in just the last month.
[00:04:33.934 --> 00:04:38.337]  So I had dinner with a particular scientist.
[00:04:39.758 --> 00:04:52.328]  And he went over the findings in our two-hour dinner for about 45 minutes, and I knew everything he was saying was accurate because I research it constantly, and he was mentioning the other studies and other scientists that have confirmed this, and he was here in town to go on Joe Rogan.
[00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:55.870]  That's Bret Weinstein, who was on last week.
[00:04:57.812 --> 00:05:00.354]  He taped it last week, he went on air this week, and it's gone viral.
[00:05:01.455 --> 00:05:03.957]  But what he said in that two-hour talk with Joe,
[00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:12.954]  The interview's gotten tens of millions of views and clips tens of millions, but no one has honed in on the big enchilada he talked about on there.
[00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:26.084]  They honed in on how children don't really get COVID, babies don't get it, how the FDA is recommending without even a law or regulation that newborns get a shot, and by the time they're nine months old, two more.
[00:05:27.445 --> 00:05:30.447]  And Joe virally said, that's horrible and terrible, and we've got that clip.
[00:05:31.428 --> 00:05:41.212]  But I checked when Weinstein did the interview, and I watched it a few days ago, and I checked yesterday, what he said, the most important part, was hidden in plain view.
[00:05:41.232 --> 00:05:56.999]  And I said after the dinner last Thursday, not this last week, but the week before last, he was here in town to take that weekend with Joe, that I was meeting with a respected scientist, that's what he is, and he was talking to a bunch of other scientists, and that they put the pieces together
[00:05:57.847 --> 00:06:06.110]  So it's kind of like a big jigsaw puzzle where we had, let's say he has 200 pieces and the last five just fell in and confirm what we already knew.
[00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:08.831]  But there's a bigger key.
[00:06:12.753 --> 00:06:18.795]  It doesn't just lower your immune system to any other virus once you've taken these Pfizer or Moderna shots that are the exact same thing.
[00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:23.637]  The Moderna is just three times stronger, 3.2 times stronger, more of it.
[00:06:24.977 --> 00:06:26.859]  The Pentagon designed it and told them what to build.
[00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:28.800]  Bill Gates was involved, heavily.
[00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:41.370]  If you put the spike protein, genetically engineered, on any virus, cold, flu, you name it, the body now completely turns off when it sees it.
[00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:48.636]  So you don't have to soup up the cold virus, or the flu virus, or another virus, a hemorrhagic virus, Ebola.
[00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:56.753]  You just simply stick a spike protein on it, or even mix it in with it when you inject it, and the body totally turns off.
[00:06:58.573 --> 00:06:59.853]  That's called a binary weapon.
[00:07:01.113 --> 00:07:01.754]  In fact, I forgot.
[00:07:01.794 --> 00:07:03.914]  Guys, print me the definition of binary weapon for the viewers.
[00:07:03.954 --> 00:07:05.034]  I mean, I know they know what it means.
[00:07:05.054 --> 00:07:07.735]  They hit you with one thing, but then they gotta hit you with another thing.
[00:07:08.715 --> 00:07:14.536]  And that way you can hit a general population, but if you haven't had the first part of the binary weapon, you get hit by the new weapon, it doesn't hurt you.
[00:07:15.676 --> 00:07:17.537]  But if you've been hit with the first part, you dead.
[00:07:18.618 --> 00:07:19.258]  Or close to it.
[00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:27.482]  So, he did a fabulous job with Joe laying it out over 10 minutes of the two hours.
[00:07:28.062 --> 00:07:33.445]  I asked them, great, and when I say great, Chase Geiser just is the MVP right now.
[00:07:33.485 --> 00:07:34.145]  We got great crew.
[00:07:34.605 --> 00:07:36.486]  He's been up here 16, 17 hours a day.
[00:07:36.646 --> 00:07:37.846]  Anything I ask him to do, he does.
[00:07:38.427 --> 00:07:40.167]  I knew this was coming up.
[00:07:40.428 --> 00:07:41.588]  I didn't think about it for a few days.
[00:07:41.648 --> 00:07:48.031]  I gave it to him last night, and I said, I want you to add documents and video to everything that Weinstein said, Professor Weinstein.
[00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:52.831]  And he did.
[00:07:53.111 --> 00:07:54.012]  So it's augmented.
[00:07:55.733 --> 00:07:57.874]  So that is in the second hour.
[00:07:58.494 --> 00:08:00.295]  Now, I'm going to spend about an hour now on this.
[00:08:00.335 --> 00:08:01.775]  When I say second hour, I'll get this done.
[00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:05.757]  And then I'm going to plunge into this giant topic that is so critical.
[00:08:05.957 --> 00:08:06.557]  And we have them.
[00:08:08.318 --> 00:08:10.419]  Now, it goes after your reproductive organs.
[00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:11.779]  It goes after your cardiovascular.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.020]  It goes after your brain.
[00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:15.101]  We know all that.
[00:08:16.633 --> 00:08:21.936]  And it's a master weapon because it depopulates, it sterilizes, it hits different people genetically different ways.
[00:08:23.176 --> 00:08:33.661]  But if you wonder what the next big event is, it's that the people that have taken it have had their immune systems knocked down to almost zero by the third shot.
[00:08:34.501 --> 00:08:35.842]  That's in the mainline literature.
[00:08:37.423 --> 00:08:41.125]  And then if they get hit with other viruses, they're weaker.
[00:08:41.185 --> 00:08:43.946]  But if you add a spike protein, zero response.
[00:08:48.086 --> 00:09:04.830]  So they can just wipe everybody out with a common cold, or if that doesn't do it, add a spike protein to whatever they want, and now it's not classic gain-in-function that they made it more communicable, or they made it even more powerful, but your body's defenses go down.
[00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.951]  So you have no shields, you have no armor.
[00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:12.872]  Like your brain, if you didn't have a skull, it was just sitting on top of your head, and a bee lands on it and stings your brain, you die.
[00:09:12.892 --> 00:09:14.252]  You got a skull to protect it.
[00:09:14.793 --> 00:09:16.313]  So they basically remove the skull,
[00:09:19.994 --> 00:09:21.515]  Or if he didn't have bones, you couldn't walk.
[00:09:21.535 --> 00:09:22.375]  He used to be a jellyfish.
[00:09:25.276 --> 00:09:25.856]  It's the same thing.
[00:09:25.896 --> 00:09:28.737]  I mean, this is so diabolical.
[00:09:30.057 --> 00:09:31.518]  And so we break a lot of big news here.
[00:09:31.558 --> 00:09:32.558]  It's all very important.
[00:09:32.578 --> 00:09:40.721]  But when I tell you something is key, key, key, I think you agree, you can see that it is beyond central.
[00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:44.142]  And I'm not just gonna show you
[00:09:45.745 --> 00:09:47.066]  Professor Weinstein talking about it.
[00:09:48.007 --> 00:10:11.423]  I'm going to show you Dr. David Bauer with the main corporate-slash-governmental agency in the UK that advises, just like John Hopkins, the whole world, bragging that it's going to turn off... He's the director of the main institute in the UK, one of the top three procedures groups in the world.
[00:10:11.924 --> 00:10:14.746]  He's just laughing how it turns your immune system off and it'll be great business.
[00:10:18.246 --> 00:10:19.987]  So, this is beyond arrogant.
[00:10:22.248 --> 00:10:23.449]  This is so diabolical.
[00:10:23.469 --> 00:10:30.492]  A binary weapon is a chemical weapon consisting of a projectile containing two substances separately that mix to produce lethal agent when the projectile is fired.
[00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:34.074]  That is a sub-derivation of it.
[00:10:34.594 --> 00:10:42.198]  Binary weapons in general, again, is where you need both of them so you can infect people with one, you're not infected, you hit them with the other and it kills them.
[00:10:42.218 --> 00:10:44.279]  This is a binary biological weapon.
[00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:46.540]  Okay, so that's...
[00:10:48.786 --> 00:10:49.507]  That's coming up.
[00:10:51.992 --> 00:10:56.100]  Here's another example of a binary system.
[00:10:57.401 --> 00:11:05.407]  You knock out the enemy's radar missile system so the radars can't deploy their missiles, and then you bring in your cluster bombs after.
[00:11:05.447 --> 00:11:07.429]  That's another example of a two-phase system.
[00:11:07.469 --> 00:11:18.258]  Or you've got armor-piercing sabots that Abrams tanks fire, and the projectile has a sabot on the front of depleted uranium that punches through the tank, then it's got explosives behind it.
[00:11:18.298 --> 00:11:18.938]  It's a two-part.
[00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.901]  You could call that a binary explosive weapon, armor-piercing.
[00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:25.303]  But with biological binary weapon, it's
[00:11:26.249 --> 00:11:32.834]  A system that hits you, turns off your immune system, and then when the new weapon or other part of the weapon comes in, you're knocked out.
[00:11:34.095 --> 00:11:36.778]  So that's my way of putting it.
[00:11:36.798 --> 00:11:36.998]  Okay.
[00:11:38.139 --> 00:11:38.819]  Let's do this now.
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:47.787]  Please remember, if you're watching us at man.video, if you're watching us at infowars.comforce.show, if you're watching us at RealAlexJones, you are the Paul Reveres.
[00:11:48.786 --> 00:12:00.192]  So if you simply decide, hey, I'm going to take this live feed right now from X at Real Alex Jones, and I'm going to retweet it, or I'm going to hit my text messages of family and friends with it, or I'm going to send out an email and say, this is really important information.
[00:12:00.472 --> 00:12:03.714]  And then once this show isn't live anymore, at 3 p.m.
[00:12:03.754 --> 00:12:11.979]  Central, it'll take us an hour or so to put up the full show for archive at Real Alex Jones and to cut up the key pieces as clips for folks that can't watch two hours.
[00:12:12.719 --> 00:12:19.303]  And you just go up to real Alex Jones, you know, at five o'clock today, six o'clock, it'll all be there, and you just decide what's most important and you send it out.
[00:12:20.363 --> 00:12:21.044]  That's the war.
[00:12:21.064 --> 00:12:25.486]  It's not just about you knowing, and I know I'm stating obvious here, it's about you, Paul, revering it.
[00:12:27.187 --> 00:12:29.829]  This show is a binary weapon against evil and lies.
[00:12:30.329 --> 00:12:37.253]  We do the broadcast, that's phase one, you then carry it into the enemy operation and destroy their lies.
[00:12:37.794 --> 00:12:41.656]  So the broadcast is the tank firing the weapon,
[00:12:42.932 --> 00:12:51.980]  And the armor-piercing nose that goes through the armor, you are the explosives that detonate politically inside the enemy operation.
[00:12:54.662 --> 00:12:55.183]  Comprende?
[00:12:56.564 --> 00:12:57.565]  That's how important you are.
[00:13:00.587 --> 00:13:01.568]  You're the most important part.
[00:13:02.689 --> 00:13:03.430]  Let it sink in.
[00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:04.411]  Think about it.
[00:13:04.991 --> 00:13:06.533]  No, it's not like, oh, you're important, share it.
[00:13:07.273 --> 00:13:08.975]  You are what overrides the system.
[00:13:10.376 --> 00:13:22.205]  You and your support at drjonesnaturals.com with the amazing supplements and nano-silver technology that's so incredible to defend yourself and your family and infowarestore.com with all the incredible D.R.
[00:13:22.225 --> 00:13:31.933]  Jones Natural products like CBD gummies and 1,000 milligram tincture, super high quality, lowers inflammation, so good for your whole body and brain and your heart.
[00:13:33.414 --> 00:13:36.256]  Lowest price you're going to find on 1,000 milligram high quality CBD out there.
[00:13:39.638 --> 00:13:40.759]  1,000 milligrams in each little bottle.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.123]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:13:45.223 --> 00:13:46.104]  All right, let's do it.
[00:13:48.486 --> 00:13:52.509]  And there's a bunch of other news after I hit the COVID news, the biggest yet.
[00:13:54.051 --> 00:13:54.491]  You knew it.
[00:13:55.652 --> 00:13:56.713]  Even CNN admits it.
[00:13:56.913 --> 00:13:57.634]  It's all true.
[00:13:57.754 --> 00:14:03.599]  Couldn't hide it like they tried to do with the trans shooter in Nashville or the other six before her.
[00:14:05.506 --> 00:14:12.351]  This is the eighth known trans shooter in the last two years going into schools and killing people.
[00:14:15.413 --> 00:14:17.334]  And it looks like Crooks was probably like that.
[00:14:17.954 --> 00:14:18.915]  But this is confirmed.
[00:14:20.176 --> 00:14:21.136]  That's their day of rage.
[00:14:21.577 --> 00:14:24.058]  We'll explain the psychology behind it and why the media tries to cover it up.
[00:14:24.458 --> 00:14:25.019]  But it failed.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.682]  Coming up, was angry that people were anti-trans.
[00:14:29.782 --> 00:14:30.763]  Probably sick of hearing about it.
[00:14:31.083 --> 00:14:32.584]  Well, he showed them
[00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.110]  Totally evil.
[00:14:37.671 --> 00:14:38.291]  They're in Georgia.
[00:14:39.172 --> 00:14:40.272]  Alright, let's begin.
[00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:42.373]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:44.594]  This is R.A.
[00:14:45.815 --> 00:14:48.696]  Inbo Nalygal, if I'm pronouncing that right.
[00:14:49.677 --> 00:14:50.277]  Collect the handle.
[00:14:51.618 --> 00:14:57.182]  You really need to get off the talk radio format and get into a long-form podcast format, Sear.
[00:14:58.042 --> 00:15:05.707]  Trains of thought don't have to be broken by commercial breaks and you spend an hour pontificating on a point that you have to reintroduce each break.
[00:15:06.328 --> 00:15:12.092]  In my opinion, being a listener since Obama-ception woke me up, I'm forever grateful to you.
[00:15:12.152 --> 00:15:15.234]  I'm grateful for you and your support, you caring, you being involved.
[00:15:15.374 --> 00:15:15.514]  Okay.
[00:15:16.704 --> 00:15:21.425]  Here's the long and short of it, and I answer this question all the time, and it just needs to be answered over and over again.
[00:15:21.445 --> 00:15:25.146]  People watching on X are like, why are there ads every, you know, 15-20 minutes?
[00:15:25.166 --> 00:15:25.966]  Well, what is this?
[00:15:27.287 --> 00:15:27.847]  Let me explain.
[00:15:28.467 --> 00:15:30.647]  Right now, you're not seeing ads, other than a quick little plug I did.
[00:15:31.347 --> 00:15:33.548]  We gotta pay for the crew and everything we're doing here, plus the great products.
[00:15:35.028 --> 00:15:36.589]  I've been on the air for 30 years.
[00:15:36.649 --> 00:15:38.469]  I've been on talk radio for 29 years.
[00:15:39.229 --> 00:15:41.010]  I've been syndicated for 27 and a half years.
[00:15:43.408 --> 00:15:46.230]  Most folks are getting their news from the internet now, but that can be heavily censored.
[00:15:46.511 --> 00:15:51.795]  When they took me off everything six years ago with the giant censorship, we were on hundreds of radio stations.
[00:15:51.815 --> 00:15:52.956]  We've gotten even more now, over 350.
[00:15:52.996 --> 00:16:02.163]  And we were able to stay on air even though we only had Infowars.com and Bandop Video that we launched, and the radio stations.
[00:16:02.203 --> 00:16:03.063]  We still reach people.
[00:16:03.103 --> 00:16:04.064]  We still got sponsorship.
[00:16:04.104 --> 00:16:04.865]  We still got support.
[00:16:06.437 --> 00:16:15.423]  And I had to sell the backup stuff I had that I always had nest egg to keep us operating, and we're down to nothing right now, so we're right on E, through these fights.
[00:16:15.483 --> 00:16:19.985]  That was the job to be a hard target, and to have diversity in old media and the newest media.
[00:16:21.466 --> 00:16:27.130]  So we've always been on the cutting edge of new ways to reach people with high tech, but we've also are old school AM and FM radio.
[00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.231]  And that's declined a lot, but it's still a substantive audience.
[00:16:29.271 --> 00:16:34.975]  So we don't run, for years, our personal network breaks most of the time.
[00:16:36.312 --> 00:16:36.752]  99% of the time.
[00:16:36.812 --> 00:16:40.316]  We run the local brakes that belong to local stations.
[00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:45.061]  You hear our ads on the National because we're just covering up their local brakes because that's not supposed to air on our system.
[00:16:45.361 --> 00:16:56.273]  That's why when you watch NFL games, say, on Fox at home, you see National ads, then locally you see local ads for the car dealerships, or the restaurant, the steakhouse, or the gym, or the local telecom company.
[00:16:57.389 --> 00:17:00.011]  You're seeing local ads and you're seeing network ads.
[00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:01.492]  So we're old school media.
[00:17:02.113 --> 00:17:05.156]  I've been around a long time and that saved us.
[00:17:05.256 --> 00:17:10.300]  That said, I do all sorts of live shows and all sorts of live broadcasts multiple times a week.
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:15.204]  You're seeing one right now that don't do that and aren't that format and are the podcast format.
[00:17:18.674 --> 00:17:20.355]  Adam Curry was the first podcaster.
[00:17:20.375 --> 00:17:20.975]  He's on record.
[00:17:21.095 --> 00:17:22.995]  I came along the next six months of it.
[00:17:23.396 --> 00:17:25.276]  So I'm one of the trailblazing podcasters.
[00:17:25.636 --> 00:17:31.758]  We had tens of millions of podcaster subscribers when Apple knocked us off and deleted our systems and tried to block it, but it came back.
[00:17:31.778 --> 00:17:32.678]  That's how it's built to do.
[00:17:33.158 --> 00:17:34.458]  So I understand podcasting.
[00:17:34.498 --> 00:17:35.399]  Got Joe Rogan into it.
[00:17:35.519 --> 00:17:36.679]  One of the main guys that did that.
[00:17:37.019 --> 00:17:37.919]  Believe me, I know all about it.
[00:17:38.399 --> 00:17:40.000]  I'm one of the original OGs on that.
[00:17:42.285 --> 00:17:48.610]  Uh, if they're able to shut down InfoWars in the next two and a half months, then that's the, you know, date is mid-November to early December.
[00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:49.891]  I've already explained that last week.
[00:17:49.911 --> 00:17:51.512]  I'm going to re-explain it again.
[00:17:51.532 --> 00:17:55.015]  I say about 60% chance Rebels stay on air, so cross your fingers.
[00:17:57.057 --> 00:18:03.702]  I will probably go to a direct podcast format while we rebuild through a new system.
[00:18:05.219 --> 00:18:06.399]  And I'll have to work with somebody else.
[00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:07.080]  That's how this works.
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.380]  We've got these undischargeable judgments and rigged courts.
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.962]  They can't stop me having a show with somebody else, and they can't stop me, you know, getting my paycheck.
[00:18:13.982 --> 00:18:14.622]  They can't get that.
[00:18:14.922 --> 00:18:18.683]  They can try to grab it out of a bank, but they can't get it from the boss, from the company.
[00:18:19.343 --> 00:18:22.204]  And in phase one, we'll do a podcast and live reports and a bunch of stuff.
[00:18:22.824 --> 00:18:30.807]  And I've got unlimited interviews I can do, which I've not done as many because I'm busy on my own show, but I'll be on tons of shows right away and doing podcasts right away.
[00:18:31.347 --> 00:18:34.088]  And then we will reconstitute and at least produce something
[00:18:35.267 --> 00:18:45.891]  For talk radio, probably something like an hour a day show that's like a hard-hitting news program that's live and then sometimes is a compilation of the latest stuff we did.
[00:18:46.851 --> 00:18:51.293]  So we are going to move out of talk radio if they're able to shut us down.
[00:18:51.993 --> 00:18:55.095]  If they don't, then that's in the stars, what God wants.
[00:18:55.195 --> 00:19:00.677]  I will continue with the talk radio format, but we're probably gonna cut it to two hours next year.
[00:19:02.675 --> 00:19:09.778]  And then do an hour of podcasting, pure, more, and then do more special reports and things, because those are definitely very effective at getting out.
[00:19:10.158 --> 00:19:12.279]  So, great question.
[00:19:13.579 --> 00:19:17.921]  You just got what's going on, but if it wasn't for Talk Radio and we're on some TV stations and cable stations too, we wouldn't be here.
[00:19:19.221 --> 00:19:23.903]  That's why it's important to not just have big tech media, but remember, old-fashioned radio and TV didn't watch you.
[00:19:24.203 --> 00:19:25.584]  The internet now is two-way, baby.
[00:19:26.405 --> 00:19:26.905]  The show.
[00:19:27.526 --> 00:19:30.167]  You should tune into UHF, VHF, or AM, FM.
[00:19:30.187 --> 00:19:31.408]  It wasn't, you didn't know what you were watching.
[00:19:32.289 --> 00:19:34.130]  Had to have you fill out diaries with Arbitron.
[00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:35.611]  Now these are great questions.
[00:19:35.631 --> 00:19:36.852]  Took me eight minutes to answer that one.
[00:19:38.213 --> 00:19:39.473]  But it's a really good question.
[00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:42.736]  All right, this is overhead shot, please.
[00:19:42.756 --> 00:19:49.800]  This is at... R... BiancoUS.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.821]  I know I'm butchering these.
[00:19:51.721 --> 00:19:53.903]  R-B-I-A-N-C-O-U-S.
[00:19:55.524 --> 00:19:58.026]  Alex, RE the shooting, referencing that.
[00:19:59.346 --> 00:20:02.688]  It's the media's fault for creating division.
[00:20:03.929 --> 00:20:06.171]  LGBTQ, please amplify this.
[00:20:07.551 --> 00:20:10.193]  Well, I wouldn't just agree with you because you said that, but I do agree with you.
[00:20:10.653 --> 00:20:17.137]  The mass shootings, they admit in criminology by hyping them up, giving a massive attention, it does make more lunatics try to do it.
[00:20:17.597 --> 00:20:19.879]  It's still very rare, they just hype the daylights out of it.
[00:20:20.899 --> 00:20:25.263]  You get 125, 130 people on average a year killed in mass shootings in schools.
[00:20:25.704 --> 00:20:26.825]  Most of those are gang-related.
[00:20:27.245 --> 00:20:29.027]  They had, you know, Black on Black in Chicago.
[00:20:29.107 --> 00:20:30.408]  More people killed a few days ago.
[00:20:30.488 --> 00:20:31.809]  Didn't even hit the national news.
[00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:39.637]  But you get a white kid doing it, and the media wants to make an anti-gun, then they focus on it.
[00:20:40.337 --> 00:20:44.641]  In real, just, you know, indiscriminate, Harrison Kleibold-type
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.601]  Columbine shooting.
[00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:50.623]  It's less than 25 children die a year and teachers in schools.
[00:20:50.923 --> 00:20:55.226]  It's still too many, but it's a very rare occurrence out of 350 million people.
[00:20:55.906 --> 00:20:56.186]  All right?
[00:20:57.447 --> 00:20:58.528]  So we have that information.
[00:20:59.528 --> 00:21:02.170]  And yes, I don't hate all the LGBT people.
[00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.752]  A lot of them, you know, gays against groomers are not pedophiles.
[00:21:05.412 --> 00:21:15.218]  The globalists have seized on it as a way to promote pedophilia and anti-family garbage and have tried to make the rainbow flag their new religion to try to basically take over national sovereignty and attack the church.
[00:21:16.479 --> 00:21:17.039]  So it's a cult.
[00:21:17.679 --> 00:21:18.120]  Sex cult.
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.441]  This is Maga Operator on X. At Maga Operator.
[00:21:23.001 --> 00:21:23.962]  What about Mug Club?
[00:21:24.662 --> 00:21:28.163]  I've had the Feds and the Globals for 10 weeks trying to shut us down.
[00:21:28.683 --> 00:21:29.724]  Attacking us from every angle.
[00:21:30.824 --> 00:21:33.845]  I am going to start doing more Mug Pug reports for folks.
[00:21:33.865 --> 00:21:35.065]  I apologize about that.
[00:21:35.145 --> 00:21:36.626]  And I am going to start doing more stuff for subscribers.
[00:21:36.666 --> 00:21:37.626]  So, here you go.
[00:21:39.307 --> 00:21:43.188]  Also, he went on to say, I was enjoying your Crowder appearances and Alex Jones 2.0 movie reviews.
[00:21:43.208 --> 00:21:44.729]  We're going to bring it back, brother.
[00:21:44.769 --> 00:21:45.029]  Thank you.
[00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:49.221]  This is at liberalgenius54.
[00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:54.124]  Can you do a random Alex Jones roar at the end of the stream?
[00:21:55.004 --> 00:21:58.726]  You know, how about I just do it now, because I'll probably forget to do it by the end of the stream.
[00:21:59.586 --> 00:22:01.327]  People ask why my voice is so hoarse.
[00:22:01.367 --> 00:22:03.449]  I never took acting lessons or voice lessons.
[00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:05.850]  I've screamed and yelled a lot, even without a bullhorn.
[00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.352]  And so I've got stuff on my larynx, polyps.
[00:22:10.322 --> 00:22:14.924]  I've been to an ear, nose, and eye doctor a couple times, and they said, well, it'll take six weeks.
[00:22:14.944 --> 00:22:15.724]  You can't really talk.
[00:22:15.744 --> 00:22:20.946]  You can take those polyps off, and you won't sound like you're an 80-year-old man who smokes cigarettes and drinks whiskey.
[00:22:20.966 --> 00:22:23.748]  But I just haven't done it, and it's kind of signature, so I'm leaving it there.
[00:22:24.188 --> 00:22:26.729]  I may have to do it at some point if I keep screaming, because it's getting worse.
[00:22:28.042 --> 00:22:32.743]  But I used to scream so loud at demonstrations and stuff that I'd cough up blood a few times.
[00:22:33.423 --> 00:22:34.743]  So, uh, I like to do it.
[00:22:35.003 --> 00:22:40.325]  I usually do it when I actually feel like doing it, but I'm excited about, you know, the country and the world waking up, so let me fire it up and do it.
[00:22:44.485 --> 00:22:45.506]  There, that's a little one for you.
[00:22:46.906 --> 00:22:47.326]  All right.
[00:22:47.346 --> 00:22:50.046]  Because you are the folks out there, everybody, that care the most.
[00:22:50.066 --> 00:22:52.527]  You're the people that are subscribing over at Real Alex Jones.
[00:22:56.491 --> 00:22:58.232]  All right.
[00:22:59.653 --> 00:23:03.254]  Modern Warfare with Alex Jones at Alex Jones MW3.
[00:23:03.294 --> 00:23:04.515]  Know those folks.
[00:23:05.195 --> 00:23:07.797]  Can you interview your mom and dad on InfoWars someday?
[00:23:09.678 --> 00:23:10.958]  My parents are very private.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:19.082]  But I do feel like, because they're getting older, that I should interview them soon.
[00:23:19.142 --> 00:23:20.423]  So tell you what.
[00:23:22.108 --> 00:23:28.330]  They don't want to be on camera, but I'll try to do an audio interview with both of them in the near future just for you, because I've already been thinking about that.
[00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:28.990]  That's a great idea.
[00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:35.732]  Alright, Western Invasion, at Western Invasion asks, what do you think the solution is for the Great Replacement could be?
[00:23:36.232 --> 00:23:39.213]  Europe and the UK is rife, as you already know.
[00:23:40.133 --> 00:23:43.154]  It doesn't get better, it only gets worse.
[00:23:43.594 --> 00:23:44.154]  How does it end?
[00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:49.654]  We got 40 million illegals in the last 15 years, conservatively.
[00:23:49.674 --> 00:23:52.036]  It's over 20 million just since Biden got in.
[00:23:52.076 --> 00:23:53.437]  It's accelerated exponentially.
[00:23:53.477 --> 00:23:56.860]  I mean, Trump got shot when he was showing that graph.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.303]  Guys, pull up the graph that Trump was reading when he got shot.
[00:24:01.504 --> 00:24:01.984]  It'll come up.
[00:24:02.665 --> 00:24:03.325]  Here's Obama.
[00:24:05.107 --> 00:24:06.688]  And here's the illegal immigration here.
[00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:09.250]  And then Trump gets in.
[00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:12.092]  And it goes like this.
[00:24:14.013 --> 00:24:17.554]  And then Biden gets in, and it goes like this.
[00:24:18.435 --> 00:24:19.535]  So that's basically the graph.
[00:24:20.696 --> 00:24:27.959]  So, Obama's here, Trump gets in, it goes like that, Biden gets in, of course it hasn't gone down yet, it's just, it's like up here.
[00:24:29.079 --> 00:24:31.060]  So, yeah, there it is, see?
[00:24:32.841 --> 00:24:35.482]  So you can see Obama right there, then Trump gets in, it goes boom.
[00:24:36.202 --> 00:24:41.244]  So, half of that 40 million's come in in just the last three and a half, four years,
[00:24:42.779 --> 00:24:45.201]  And so that's a question that would take hours to answer.
[00:24:45.842 --> 00:24:50.706]  We have to culturally, with the people that are here, wake them up to the new world order, and that's starting to happen.
[00:24:51.186 --> 00:24:52.988]  But it's hard when it's first-generation folks.
[00:24:53.008 --> 00:24:53.929]  It just takes two or three.
[00:24:54.489 --> 00:24:57.552]  That's why black folks now are going with Trump, Hispanics are going with Trump.
[00:24:58.072 --> 00:25:00.274]  They've had generations now to actually figure out what's going on.
[00:25:00.334 --> 00:25:01.315]  It takes that for anybody.
[00:25:02.896 --> 00:25:09.182]  And then we have to shut off the open borders, we have to deport the military-age men and the military people that are here.
[00:25:10.657 --> 00:25:12.879]  And we've got to prosecute people for the human trafficking.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.121]  And Europe's got to do the same thing.
[00:25:16.982 --> 00:25:19.124]  And then we've got to stop bowing to the illegals.
[00:25:19.144 --> 00:25:21.526]  We've got to cut off them getting all these freebies that nobody else gets.
[00:25:21.806 --> 00:25:23.167]  That's the magnet and the incentive.
[00:25:24.068 --> 00:25:26.470]  And so, we're already pretty screwed.
[00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.072]  But there's the other converse.
[00:25:31.553 --> 00:25:36.457]  Where 50% of black males are going to vote Trump.
[00:25:36.477 --> 00:25:39.520]  50% of Hispanic males in most polls.
[00:25:40.697 --> 00:25:44.879]  Triple the Hispanic females, triple the black females, something like 30%.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:55.304]  So, there's a trend as things get bad and bad, and worse, that people kind of figure it out real quick, even if they are first generation or second.
[00:25:56.344 --> 00:26:08.190]  So, the Democrats though right now want more illegals in because even if they're not voting right away, which a lot of them are, they give them more congressional apportionment for more blue seats in those districts that are created.
[00:26:09.462 --> 00:26:11.043]  So that's why they're doing it, and Democrats have admitted that.
[00:26:12.303 --> 00:26:23.869]  Court Jester at NY1SRED asked the question, I'd just like to know what keeps you motivated on a daily basis?
[00:26:25.489 --> 00:26:36.975]  Well, that's a really good question, and it's a lot of things, but I've always had a sense of wanting to fight tyrants and wanting to promote freedom, and I also have an instinctive and spiritual need to not lay down.
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:39.761]  And so I never really ran from fights.
[00:26:39.781 --> 00:26:42.542]  I always ran towards them, which is just an instinctive thing.
[00:26:43.743 --> 00:26:44.744]  And I like to fight.
[00:26:46.625 --> 00:26:48.526]  Politically, culturally, physically, if I have to.
[00:26:48.866 --> 00:26:49.867]  Once it starts, I enjoy it.
[00:26:51.008 --> 00:26:56.834]  And I just don't roll over, and I realize things are much worse if we do roll over and grovel.
[00:26:57.114 --> 00:27:08.526]  Plus, it doesn't feel good to serve evil, even when I've entertained it, not consciously, not like I was actually entertaining it, but I've war-gamed it, and it just feels terrible, and it feels like God's removing His presence from me, even entertaining it.
[00:27:10.279 --> 00:27:10.919]  In the war game.
[00:27:11.459 --> 00:27:13.280]  Not actually entertaining, but like, what would that be like?
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.821]  And I've been around some globalists.
[00:27:15.841 --> 00:27:17.461]  They try to get me to sell out.
[00:27:17.941 --> 00:27:19.422]  It feels really cold and like failure.
[00:27:19.442 --> 00:27:20.342]  It doesn't make me feel good.
[00:27:20.862 --> 00:27:22.543]  It feels good to stand with God.
[00:27:22.583 --> 00:27:23.583]  It feels good to fight evil.
[00:27:23.663 --> 00:27:24.663]  It feels good to have courage.
[00:27:25.063 --> 00:27:26.584]  It feels good to get to know all you people.
[00:27:26.604 --> 00:27:28.585]  I mean, I meet our listeners and supporters.
[00:27:28.605 --> 00:27:30.985]  They could be Hispanic, black, white, Asian, old, young.
[00:27:31.425 --> 00:27:32.806]  And they have electricity in their eyes.
[00:27:32.826 --> 00:27:33.466]  They're alive.
[00:27:33.486 --> 00:27:34.106]  They're informed.
[00:27:34.126 --> 00:27:34.626]  They're loving.
[00:27:34.646 --> 00:27:35.106]  They're caring.
[00:27:35.487 --> 00:27:36.087]  I see leftists.
[00:27:36.107 --> 00:27:39.768]  They look like zombies that some demonic spider drank their essence out.
[00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:41.363]  Skeksy and the Dark Crystal!
[00:27:42.717 --> 00:27:45.399]  So to me, it just feels right.
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.761]  Plus it's intellectually right and spiritually right.
[00:27:48.602 --> 00:27:50.023]  And so that's what keeps me going.
[00:27:50.703 --> 00:27:51.804]  I'm my own worst enemy.
[00:27:52.545 --> 00:27:55.107]  And I get up here and say, take all these supplements and do all this stuff.
[00:27:55.828 --> 00:27:57.769]  And then I'll look around and go, wait, it's been six months.
[00:27:57.829 --> 00:27:58.830]  I was never a supplement guy.
[00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:59.470]  I know they work.
[00:27:59.831 --> 00:28:00.832]  I know people want them.
[00:28:00.852 --> 00:28:02.593]  I know it's one of the fastest growing industries.
[00:28:02.633 --> 00:28:04.695]  I've had sponsors for almost 30 years that do it.
[00:28:05.615 --> 00:28:07.197]  And I never religiously take it.
[00:28:07.217 --> 00:28:08.418]  I'll finally start taking it.
[00:28:08.838 --> 00:28:10.079]  I'll finally start drinking more water.
[00:28:10.099 --> 00:28:10.940]  I'll finally start, you know,
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.201]  Even without extra exercise, because I always do some exercise.
[00:28:14.221 --> 00:28:19.642]  I'm doing the same amount of exercise I was doing two months ago, but I'm religiously now.
[00:28:20.502 --> 00:28:23.522]  Got the little pill containers out, taking them, doing the green drink, all that.
[00:28:23.843 --> 00:28:25.903]  Taking the X2 every day, X3.
[00:28:27.623 --> 00:28:31.984]  And I've lost 13 pounds since I started doing this religiously about a month and a half ago, really.
[00:28:32.004 --> 00:28:34.265]  And everybody goes, man, you look better, your skin is yes.
[00:28:34.285 --> 00:28:35.905]  I was like, yeah, I'm actually doing what I say.
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.661]  So, I'm my own worst enemy.
[00:28:41.321 --> 00:28:43.841]  And so, that's what keeps me going.
[00:28:44.181 --> 00:28:45.262]  All right, great question.
[00:28:46.162 --> 00:28:48.182]  The questions get more political and stuff here now.
[00:28:49.443 --> 00:28:53.924]  Mr. Informed at Real Mr. Informed on X will show their question.
[00:28:55.944 --> 00:28:56.584]  Ask the question.
[00:28:57.024 --> 00:28:58.465]  Long-time listener and love the show.
[00:28:58.865 --> 00:29:03.266]  What is your advice to those who are just now waking up to see the system for what it is?
[00:29:06.434 --> 00:29:14.026]  Uh, it can be overwhelming at first, depending on your psychological makeup and spiritual makeup and historical, you know, how you were raised.
[00:29:15.888 --> 00:29:20.074]  So that's another huge question for the ages, but know that God's in control.
[00:29:21.704 --> 00:29:25.307]  No, you're part of a timeless continuum of consciousness that God created.
[00:29:25.808 --> 00:29:28.971]  Thank God for the gift of consciousness, and ask God to lead God and direct you.
[00:29:29.011 --> 00:29:32.875]  And don't feel overwhelmed that you've personally got to defeat this.
[00:29:32.955 --> 00:29:45.787]  You've just got to make the right spiritual, cultural, economic decisions, or at least try, and God sees that, and then God will finish taking you across the chasm.
[00:29:45.807 --> 00:29:46.808]  It's that experience.
[00:29:48.442 --> 00:29:51.243]  And then help others, reach out to others, and get more informed.
[00:29:51.944 --> 00:29:57.747]  And, you know, learn to trust but verify as Ronald Reagan said.
[00:29:57.767 --> 00:30:03.590]  And, I mean, there's just thousands of other points on that front.
[00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.131]  Don't get blackpilled.
[00:30:06.004 --> 00:30:07.705]  Because that's not going to help you.
[00:30:07.885 --> 00:30:10.066]  We really are powerful creatures God made.
[00:30:10.727 --> 00:30:13.408]  And look how far we've come from 30 years ago.
[00:30:13.468 --> 00:30:14.849]  Maybe 1% of people knew about this.
[00:30:14.929 --> 00:30:17.290]  I'd say 30, 40% are pretty much awake now.
[00:30:17.691 --> 00:30:18.771]  Half are somewhat awake.
[00:30:19.552 --> 00:30:23.974]  I mean, 40% of people now support and trust the medical system.
[00:30:24.354 --> 00:30:27.696]  Just four years ago, it was in the 90s to the 80s to the 70s, depending on the poll.
[00:30:28.277 --> 00:30:29.437]  I mean, people are waking up.
[00:30:30.038 --> 00:30:31.178]  And at first they don't trust.
[00:30:31.258 --> 00:30:32.279]  Now they know they're being lied to.
[00:30:32.319 --> 00:30:33.059]  Now they research.
[00:30:33.379 --> 00:30:34.100]  It's a process.
[00:30:40.475 --> 00:30:47.561]  He went on to say, I know there are a lot of them, and it's important to remember there are new listeners every day to help guide them in a positive direction.
[00:30:47.921 --> 00:30:48.161]  Yeah.
[00:30:49.242 --> 00:30:50.963]  I've got a blind spot I've talked about.
[00:30:50.983 --> 00:30:55.187]  It's another great question where I've been on there 30 years.
[00:30:55.247 --> 00:30:58.629]  I've been reading and researching for 40, literally, since I was 10 years old.
[00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:06.616]  Reading adult history, military information, just always kind of fascinating because it was the real world.
[00:31:07.737 --> 00:31:07.837]  And
[00:31:09.611 --> 00:31:25.462]  I've covered 9-11 and made four or five films and written books on it, and Yip done hundreds of marches, and I did it so much that about ten years ago, I was like, man, I've been doing this for, you know, over a decade, and I still cover it some, but it's important to remember that.
[00:31:25.482 --> 00:31:27.424]  It's important to remember how fluoride got in the water.
[00:31:27.444 --> 00:31:29.305]  It's important to understand the private Federal Reserve.
[00:31:29.345 --> 00:31:30.686]  It's important to understand basic history.
[00:31:31.306 --> 00:31:32.607]  That's why I've made films like Endgame.
[00:31:32.627 --> 00:31:36.310]  Two and a half hours gives you a pretty good basic education on how stuff works.
[00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:41.671]  But it is important to revisit the basics, and I think that's a great point.
[00:31:43.752 --> 00:31:45.073]  Also, at T.J.
[00:31:45.153 --> 00:31:49.194]  Carson, or at T.J., at T.J.
[00:31:51.255 --> 00:31:58.218]  Caron, 1735, is there anything else I can do to get involved in Infowars to keep up the fight?
[00:32:01.059 --> 00:32:03.360]  I mean, take clips out yourself, post them on X,
[00:32:04.721 --> 00:32:05.902]  Post them everywhere else you can.
[00:32:05.962 --> 00:32:07.463]  Send them out in emails, text messages.
[00:32:09.123 --> 00:32:09.984]  Start your own show.
[00:32:10.144 --> 00:32:11.265]  Might get 100 viewers, might get 1,000.
[00:32:11.325 --> 00:32:15.287]  These globalists go around and talk to 1,000 people or 100 people.
[00:32:15.327 --> 00:32:17.268]  I mean, every little bit helps.
[00:32:18.428 --> 00:32:19.389]  Support the broadcast.
[00:32:19.409 --> 00:32:20.129]  Spread the word about it.
[00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.191]  Support other broadcasts that are telling the truth.
[00:32:23.711 --> 00:32:24.612]  Pray for the broadcast.
[00:32:24.652 --> 00:32:27.253]  Pray for the global awakening.
[00:32:27.273 --> 00:32:30.135]  I mean, get other people to vote.
[00:32:31.738 --> 00:32:32.979]  Continue to educate your friends and family.
[00:32:32.999 --> 00:32:33.859]  Don't get frustrated with them.
[00:32:33.899 --> 00:32:35.519]  Just continue to lovingly inform them.
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:39.001]  These questions are all so good, I could talk for an hour on each question.
[00:32:40.361 --> 00:32:47.144]  Let's talk to Wes at RealJWAH310.
[00:32:48.904 --> 00:32:50.445]  How close are we to World War III?
[00:32:50.505 --> 00:32:55.767]  It seems to have nightmares about going through nuclear holocaust.
[00:32:58.203 --> 00:32:59.204]  How close are we to WW3?
[00:32:59.304 --> 00:33:02.266]  I seem to have nightmares about going through nuclear holocaust.
[00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:04.588]  I hope we don't get to that precipice.
[00:33:05.729 --> 00:33:07.871]  Okay, I mean, there's a million ways to look at this.
[00:33:08.172 --> 00:33:10.133]  It's another incredibly huge question.
[00:33:11.014 --> 00:33:14.437]  These are all just too good and too big and too timeless and too expansive.
[00:33:16.859 --> 00:33:23.425]  We're already in World War III, and we're going into World War IV if you want to get CIA, Rand Corporation, technical.
[00:33:24.042 --> 00:33:49.094]  Now I'll get on air and say we're in danger of World War III because the general public knows what that means, but the CIA and the Russians and the Chinese and their military handbooks and their military histories call the Cold War starting in 1946 right through the Afghan withdrawal
[00:33:50.782 --> 00:33:52.485]  They call that World War 3.
[00:33:53.125 --> 00:33:57.392]  Asymmetrical, proxy wars, economic wars, hack awards.
[00:33:58.333 --> 00:34:04.222]  And then now World War 4 is what they say we're in danger of having, which is total thermonuclear trench warfare.
[00:34:05.493 --> 00:34:06.434]  Absolute destruction.
[00:34:07.394 --> 00:34:18.021]  Whether you call it World War III or IV, we're on the precipice of a full-blown new global war, meaning war all over the major continents and every major country somehow involved.
[00:34:18.581 --> 00:34:26.106]  Wars going on in three or more theaters, with major powers lined up against each other, different axes.
[00:34:28.327 --> 00:34:34.211]  And so, the danger of this proxy war, hybrid war, in the Middle East and in
[00:34:35.526 --> 00:34:42.851]  What's happening in Europe, in Ukraine, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus.
[00:34:45.973 --> 00:34:51.977]  On the RAND Corporation threat escalation ladder, we're moving very quickly with Ukraine a month ago invading.
[00:34:53.018 --> 00:35:00.882]  Russia and all the rest of it and blowing up Nord Stream pipelines and all this into tactical nuclear weapons being used and you're off the races.
[00:35:00.982 --> 00:35:03.924]  And the Ukrainians are always trying to blow up nuclear reactors and admitting it.
[00:35:03.944 --> 00:35:05.545]  I mean, they are out of control.
[00:35:06.085 --> 00:35:07.246]  But that's the deep state running them.
[00:35:07.286 --> 00:35:12.248]  So NATO is putting out propaganda now about nuclear war survivable.
[00:35:12.328 --> 00:35:13.089]  It's no big deal.
[00:35:13.169 --> 00:35:14.349]  I mean, this is crazy town.
[00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.652]  So we're in the beginnings of World War Four.
[00:35:19.705 --> 00:35:24.389]  If you use the establishment's internal, they're not even secret, but it's more academic definitions.
[00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.372]  You can research everything I'm saying, you'll find it to be true.
[00:35:27.392 --> 00:35:29.394]  I mean, I'll just say this stuff.
[00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:30.875]  All right?
[00:35:31.115 --> 00:35:31.936]  Okay, let's move on here.
[00:35:32.416 --> 00:35:32.877]  Great question.
[00:35:34.341 --> 00:35:42.391]  Info Uncensored at Info Uncensored on X. If money was no object at all, and you had a gazillion million dollars, what would you do?
[00:35:43.152 --> 00:35:48.238]  What keeps you actually going on in life, Alex, other than the obvious answers like your kids, your faith in God?
[00:35:48.758 --> 00:35:50.520]  What's the driving force beyond all of that?
[00:35:50.661 --> 00:35:51.442]  I mean, it's God.
[00:35:51.502 --> 00:35:53.164]  I mean, this is the test.
[00:35:54.611 --> 00:35:57.032]  of good versus evil and to see who you are.
[00:35:57.132 --> 00:35:58.272]  You're an eternal spirit.
[00:35:58.372 --> 00:36:09.714]  It's been mathematically and scientifically proven that we interconnect with higher dimensions, that our cells are just a colony creature resonating electrochemically as a transceiver, receiving and transceiving.
[00:36:10.834 --> 00:36:18.616]  And we are part of the timeless energy of God that he's focused down into a new being with free will and
[00:36:22.601 --> 00:36:27.603]  If I had a gazillion dollars, I would do what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:36:27.643 --> 00:36:31.904]  is doing, exposing the war on children for the purpose of being poisoned and sterilized.
[00:36:33.304 --> 00:36:36.425]  I would file giant lawsuits against Bill Gates and all the globalists.
[00:36:36.465 --> 00:36:42.047]  I would use the money against Soros, which has taken over roughly half the DAs in the country and most of the major cities.
[00:36:43.307 --> 00:36:45.868]  I would just have a huge educational program that humans are good.
[00:36:45.888 --> 00:36:51.830]  I would also free up all the new free energy
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:37:04.928]  I say no, they're 30, 40 years old, many of them that are there, and really empower humanity, and be totally honest with people about our real potential, but also the incredible danger of these advanced technologies, as weapons could destroy us.
[00:37:04.948 --> 00:37:11.692]  And that's the globalist answer to depopulating, and dumbing people down, and suppressing technology, is this will get out of hand, we'll destroy ourselves, but they're already doing that.
[00:37:12.572 --> 00:37:22.219]  I believe honesty is the way to go, and then say, you know, we have global votes, or national votes, and if the nations want to vote, the people will then have a referendum, on we're outlawing this technology here on Earth,
[00:37:23.657 --> 00:37:34.705]  But if you want to go out of the asteroid belt and do it, or you want to form a colony and do it, you know, I mean, I really see that type of liberalization, not the modern term, but the real term.
[00:37:34.726 --> 00:37:36.407]  And that's a very complex question.
[00:37:36.427 --> 00:37:38.588]  I could go on for, in fact, I love these questions.
[00:37:38.608 --> 00:37:40.170]  I may do whole shows just on each question.
[00:37:41.491 --> 00:37:42.631]  So that's an excellent question.
[00:37:45.453 --> 00:37:48.696]  Tippy Top, and you can find them at git.
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.340]  I know people have these weird long handles.
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:54.741]  I just can't figure these out.
[00:37:55.101 --> 00:37:56.241]  Great handle, I just can't figure it out.
[00:37:56.281 --> 00:38:01.502]  It's a Getchapelblkth.
[00:38:02.303 --> 00:38:02.683]  Right there.
[00:38:02.703 --> 00:38:07.004]  It says, Was there an ancient civilization on Mars that got wiped out?
[00:38:07.284 --> 00:38:08.564]  How did they get wiped out?
[00:38:08.804 --> 00:38:09.784]  I like that question.
[00:38:09.804 --> 00:38:13.205]  Because I can actually pretty much answer your question to a great extent.
[00:38:14.266 --> 00:38:19.987]  So when I saw those questions this morning, I had the crew, I just told them, real simple,
[00:38:22.602 --> 00:38:33.650]  Just like I say stuff on air, and the crew does a great job, I just said, type in, evidence of nuclear war on Mars, or scientists believe nuclear war happened on Mars.
[00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:34.591]  Now, let me show you.
[00:38:35.691 --> 00:38:51.303]  Because they know it's on Mars, they've sent probes, they know that there's nothing there that would actually cause these isotopes, unless there were hydrogen bombs detonated on a scale like you would see if 50,000 huge ones were detonated.
[00:38:52.108 --> 00:38:54.189]  That's just a paraphrase, quick to stall.
[00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:56.570]  You can read the actual studies.
[00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:58.311]  So this is from Harvard.
[00:39:00.512 --> 00:39:03.953]  Evidence of massive thermonuclear explosions on Mars in the past.
[00:39:04.514 --> 00:39:10.216]  The Cydonian Hypothesis and Fermi's Paradox.
[00:39:12.757 --> 00:39:13.318]  Brandenburg.
[00:39:14.058 --> 00:39:15.079]  Here's another one, Fox News.
[00:39:15.439 --> 00:39:17.820]  Was there a nuclear blast on Mars?
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.841]  Here's the Epoch Times.
[00:39:21.941 --> 00:39:25.343]  Evidence of an ancient nuclear explosion on Mars, says scientists.
[00:39:26.984 --> 00:39:27.625]  Smithsonian.
[00:39:28.405 --> 00:39:28.946]  Intriguing.
[00:39:28.986 --> 00:39:33.588]  Carbon isotopes on Mars could be from cosmic dust, UV radiation, or ancient life.
[00:39:35.169 --> 00:39:37.951]  But where did all that nuclear explosion stuff come from?
[00:39:38.672 --> 00:39:40.633]  Nuclear alien space wars.
[00:39:40.673 --> 00:39:41.533]  A Martian theory.
[00:39:41.553 --> 00:39:42.474]  Alright.
[00:39:43.875 --> 00:39:48.758]  So your question was... Very good question.
[00:39:50.458 --> 00:39:52.479]  Was there an ancient civilization on Mars that got wiped out?
[00:39:52.579 --> 00:39:53.780]  How did they get wiped out?
[00:39:55.321 --> 00:39:58.383]  I don't know the answer to that, but there are a lot of structures that look man-made.
[00:40:00.024 --> 00:40:03.286]  There is evidence that they have ice caps in the northern and southern pole.
[00:40:03.326 --> 00:40:10.291]  There is massive evidence that it was once water there, but their atmosphere, because their gravity being lower, was not strong enough.
[00:40:11.251 --> 00:40:17.115]  I say there, whatever was on the planet, that they've taken shots of fossils that look like single-cell organisms.
[00:40:19.684 --> 00:40:21.385]  But we get lied to so much, who knows?
[00:40:22.406 --> 00:40:31.090]  But they do find the isotope for Xenon-129 that is in giant hydrogen explosions.
[00:40:31.751 --> 00:40:34.072]  And it's a level so high, they believe it couldn't be other things.
[00:40:34.372 --> 00:40:35.273]  It would be lower than that.
[00:40:36.253 --> 00:40:37.634]  Very, very interesting.
[00:40:38.475 --> 00:40:41.976]  Whether they had a civilization, or maybe our ancestors came from there, who knows?
[00:40:44.298 --> 00:40:46.099]  And then escaped to Earth, or vice versa.
[00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:52.352]  Whether Atlantis existed, they had some secret technology that blew up their island and darkened the skies for years and all the rest of it.
[00:40:52.732 --> 00:40:53.753]  We now have all that.
[00:40:54.454 --> 00:40:59.997]  So whether that happened on Mars or not, we could be where they're at, or were at, or possibly were, very soon.
[00:41:01.078 --> 00:41:03.920]  Excellente question.
[00:41:06.241 --> 00:41:10.324]  All right, let's now move on to the next question.
[00:41:12.165 --> 00:41:13.446]  We do so much preparation for the show.
[00:41:13.466 --> 00:41:14.526]  I got so many notes here.
[00:41:15.027 --> 00:41:17.008]  We're teleprompter free, but I do go to these so I can
[00:41:17.756 --> 00:41:18.937]  I'll obviously be accurate here.
[00:41:21.279 --> 00:41:27.244]  Here's a Say Yes to the Truth at Say Yes to the Truth on X. See how easy that handle was?
[00:41:28.065 --> 00:41:39.294]  Why aren't these evil people committing... Why aren't these evil people committing crimes against humanity getting arrested by those who swore an oath to defend the country against enemies, foreign and domestic?
[00:41:41.101 --> 00:41:42.402]  Is this oath meaningless?
[00:41:42.962 --> 00:41:49.905]  Could you share how we can make crimes too big to arrest into, yep, that's a crime.
[00:41:50.665 --> 00:41:51.586]  Let's arrest them all.
[00:41:51.846 --> 00:41:54.067]  What a great, I mean, I'm not just kissing your ass.
[00:41:54.687 --> 00:41:58.369]  Every one of these questions has been just amazing.
[00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:05.052]  And I had a feeling they would because we get a lot of good questions from general folks at InfoWars and general callers and
[00:42:06.331 --> 00:42:11.755]  Comments and questions just on Real Alex Jones, but man, subscribers are the folks that care the most, and it's the best questions.
[00:42:12.055 --> 00:42:13.176]  Every damn one of these is excellent.
[00:42:15.478 --> 00:42:24.845]  That is such a huge question... ...that it makes my head spin.
[00:42:27.213 --> 00:42:27.773]  Let me do this.
[00:42:28.414 --> 00:42:29.755]  I've been going for 42 minutes.
[00:42:30.395 --> 00:42:36.859]  It's not that I need a break, but I don't want to just say something here, because what happens is I just had a couple thoughts, and I looked at the paper, and I couldn't remember them.
[00:42:37.319 --> 00:42:38.540]  So I'm going to air a special report.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:43.463]  I didn't use POCD, but now when I have a great thought, I can't remember it.
[00:42:43.483 --> 00:42:44.223]  I go crazy.
[00:42:44.623 --> 00:42:45.904]  You see me be a jerk to the crew sometimes.
[00:42:45.924 --> 00:42:46.645]  It has nothing to do with them.
[00:42:47.304 --> 00:42:47.504]  It's true.
[00:43:06.687 --> 00:43:09.749]  You know, it's in the spike protein hurt everybody just in the natural COVID as well.
[00:43:10.709 --> 00:43:16.953]  But I just have a great thought and then it's there and then it's it'll come right back in a moment, but not while I'm babbling.
[00:43:17.593 --> 00:43:24.737]  So let's hear one of the new excellent Greg Reese reports.
[00:43:25.458 --> 00:43:25.858]  Let's hear 22 SB 22.
[00:43:29.284 --> 00:43:31.445]  Reese, Venezuelan gang sent to America by design.
[00:43:31.465 --> 00:43:32.405]  What an important report.
[00:43:32.926 --> 00:43:37.267]  Too bad it only got 200,000 viewers on AXS yesterday and about 50,000 on InfoWars.
[00:43:37.607 --> 00:43:38.708]  His report's seen a million views.
[00:43:38.728 --> 00:43:39.648]  I mean, we're going to win the war.
[00:43:40.429 --> 00:43:48.712]  So here's that little five-minute report, and then I will come back with this question that basically has smoke coming out of my ears.
[00:43:48.792 --> 00:43:50.733]  It's kind of like Robby the Robot when he gets too many questions.
[00:43:50.773 --> 00:43:53.074]  He goes, processing, processing, cannot compute.
[00:43:53.474 --> 00:43:54.594]  Not because it's a bad question.
[00:43:54.694 --> 00:43:55.195]  It's so
[00:43:56.388 --> 00:43:57.212]  Oh, it just came back to me.
[00:43:57.252 --> 00:43:57.895]  It's coming back now.
[00:43:58.377 --> 00:44:01.149]  We'll play the report and I will return.
[00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.491]  Here we go.
[00:44:08.706 --> 00:44:18.289]  It is being reported that the Venezuelan gang Trende Aragua began taking control of apartment buildings in Aurora, Colorado last November.
[00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:22.771]  While mainstream media and government ignore it, local news is covering it.
[00:44:23.091 --> 00:44:32.515]  So now your investigator Brian Moss has obtained a confidential report into one of those apartment complexes and that report says a Venezuelan gang began taking it over in 2023
[00:44:33.795 --> 00:44:35.376]  This is the nine-page report.
[00:44:35.396 --> 00:44:37.618]  It was put together by a Denver law firm.
[00:44:38.078 --> 00:44:42.501]  They say they were hired to look into the Whispering Pines apartments by the building's lenders.
[00:44:43.021 --> 00:44:47.904]  Last month, they sent this report to Aurora's mayor, city manager, and police chief.
[00:44:48.445 --> 00:44:57.751]  As recently as Tuesday, residents at the Edge apartment complex in Aurora pushed back on reports that a Venezuelan gang had taken over their building.
[00:44:58.051 --> 00:45:03.175]  But five miles away, at the Whispering Pines, a 54-unit apartment building in Aurora,
[00:45:03.875 --> 00:45:10.102]  This detailed letter asking for confidential treatment of the contents shared a different story.
[00:45:10.622 --> 00:45:14.807]  It was sent to Aurora officials on August 9th with the investigators saying,
[00:45:24.076 --> 00:45:30.079]  Sexual abuse of minors, unlawful firearms possession, extortion, and other criminal activities.
[00:45:30.519 --> 00:45:42.584]  According to the law firm's report, the Venezuelan gang Trande Aragua has threatened to kill, and in certain instances has apparently actively attempted to kill, members of Whispering Pines Management.
[00:45:42.824 --> 00:45:50.988]  The report says a consultant for the property management company was severely beaten and stomped by gang members and was hospitalized.
[00:45:51.508 --> 00:45:56.869]  The alleged incident recorded by building cameras with screenshots attached to the letter.
[00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:06.912]  The report relies on a property manager who said that gang members allegedly stabbed a Whispering Pines resident for refusing to pay rent to the gang.
[00:46:07.512 --> 00:46:11.553]  He also told the investigators the takeover began last November.
[00:46:12.193 --> 00:46:17.775]  The report recounts that this summer the gang approached the property manager and told him they would help him out.
[00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:21.433]  In exchange for half of all the rent that he collected.
[00:46:22.033 --> 00:46:26.117]  The law firm that wrote the report called that an organized crime tactic.
[00:46:26.698 --> 00:46:29.841]  The gang members then allegedly took over vacant apartments.
[00:46:30.401 --> 00:46:35.086]  According to the document, moved families into those units and started collecting rent.
[00:46:35.666 --> 00:46:44.288]  The law firm says this is a picture of gang members breaking into a vacant apartment so they could move a Venezuelan family in and then collect rent.
[00:46:44.808 --> 00:46:48.049]  This is our business plan, one gang member told a housekeeper.
[00:46:48.569 --> 00:46:52.830]  If he, the property manager, doesn't like it, we'll fill him with bullets.
[00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:58.531]  There are reports of this Venezuelan gang in Colorado, Illinois, and Texas.
[00:46:58.911 --> 00:47:03.816]  And according to a recent Dr. Phil interview with retired Special Agent with U.S.
[00:47:03.856 --> 00:47:07.560]  Immigration, Victor Avila, this is all being done by design.
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:12.325]  Venezuela, by the way, has the lowest murder rate ever, right now.
[00:47:12.805 --> 00:47:13.486]  What does that tell you?
[00:47:14.184 --> 00:47:15.606]  Yeah, all the murderers are gone.
[00:47:15.867 --> 00:47:16.307]  They're here.
[00:47:16.928 --> 00:47:17.149]  Yeah.
[00:47:17.629 --> 00:47:20.634]  So, is it true that they're empty in prisons?
[00:47:20.975 --> 00:47:23.759]  I mean, is this Cuba all over again?
[00:47:23.859 --> 00:47:25.181]  This is not a hearsay.
[00:47:25.502 --> 00:47:28.947]  There was a memo by DHS last year admitting
[00:47:29.808 --> 00:47:39.732]  That in fact they knew that Venezuela's government was emptying their prison and rehabilitation centers or drug centers, releasing them on purpose.
[00:47:40.312 --> 00:47:44.293]  Because they knew with instructions to make, if you were going to get out, you're going to make your way to the U.S.
[00:47:45.054 --> 00:47:47.715]  That is not, we're not making that up.
[00:47:47.775 --> 00:47:48.415]  That's true.
[00:47:48.475 --> 00:47:52.156]  It was reported on and DHS admitted that that was happening.
[00:47:52.376 --> 00:47:53.157]  And in fact it has.
[00:47:53.257 --> 00:47:56.278]  El Tren de Aragua is heavily present in our country now.
[00:47:57.153 --> 00:48:12.017]  Okay, so you're telling me that DHS has acknowledged that Venezuela, for example, is empty in their prisons and their rehabilitation centers with the understanding you get out if you leave here and go to the United States.
[00:48:12.317 --> 00:48:12.597]  Yes.
[00:48:13.637 --> 00:48:25.180]  And DHS has, in writing, said, we know that's happening, we know they're coming here, we're processing them in, and have no idea where they are.
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:26.100]  Correct.
[00:48:26.897 --> 00:48:28.138]  How many people are we talking about?
[00:48:28.438 --> 00:48:28.798]  Millions.
[00:48:29.878 --> 00:48:31.239]  And just Venezuela alone.
[00:48:32.019 --> 00:48:34.520]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:48:36.942 --> 00:48:38.782]  Alright, so that's very important obviously.
[00:48:38.902 --> 00:48:43.464]  Now let me re-read the question, and I'm going to answer it as best I can in limited time.
[00:48:45.966 --> 00:48:53.409]  Why aren't these evil people committing crimes against humanity getting arrested by those who swore an oath to defend the country against enemies foreign and domestic?
[00:48:54.747 --> 00:48:55.748]  Is this oath meaningless?
[00:48:55.848 --> 00:49:04.194]  Could you share how we make crimes too big to arrest into, yep, that's a crime, let's arrest them.
[00:49:06.556 --> 00:49:07.777]  All right, excellent question.
[00:49:07.817 --> 00:49:08.837]  Let me give you the quick answer.
[00:49:09.578 --> 00:49:11.439]  For the US, and it's similar around the Western world.
[00:49:15.722 --> 00:49:20.386]  I've had a lot of big expert politicos on recently, and
[00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:26.764]  They've explained, and I've explained, the way the U.S.
[00:49:26.844 --> 00:49:33.132]  is set up now, the head of the Department of Justice, Merrick Garland, is more powerful than the president.
[00:49:35.235 --> 00:49:37.578]  Under the laws they've gotten passed, they'd be repealed.
[00:49:38.942 --> 00:49:42.625]  The Inspector General's there as well, they set up in the 70s, after Watergate.
[00:49:43.505 --> 00:49:44.766]  They're in control of all the agencies.
[00:49:45.527 --> 00:49:56.594]  And so, I've interviewed federal judges, off record, others, it's in the news, that he will not prosecute child traffickers, convicted murderers, you name it, when they come across, they just let them go.
[00:49:57.095 --> 00:49:59.516]  You see the Sanctuary City Police saying, we let murderers go.
[00:49:59.837 --> 00:50:01.278]  Played the clip Friday, yesterday.
[00:50:02.959 --> 00:50:05.801]  And so, they won't let the judges,
[00:50:07.403 --> 00:50:09.164]  And the grand juries even seek indictments.
[00:50:10.446 --> 00:50:13.348]  It's in the law, they can hold them for one month and they cross illegally, that's it.
[00:50:14.249 --> 00:50:18.172]  She'll have a guy that's been convicted four times of raping kids in Guatemala, Mexico, and the U.S.
[00:50:18.612 --> 00:50:25.258]  They catch him driving a school bus, this is a real case in South Texas that I covered, that the judge told me about and I went and looked up, that was in her court.
[00:50:27.014 --> 00:50:29.575]  And he was ordered released by Merrick Garland.
[00:50:29.976 --> 00:50:32.737]  And the federal marshals and the good FBI agents are totally upset about this.
[00:50:33.077 --> 00:50:35.798]  Their hands are tied, just like the Border Patrol's order to facilitate the smuggling.
[00:50:35.818 --> 00:50:36.419]  They don't like it either.
[00:50:36.659 --> 00:50:38.280]  That's why their union's come out and exposed it.
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:45.443]  I think they should just stand down and let it all build up, but needing Congress to cut off all the freebies they give them, that'll stop it as well.
[00:50:45.483 --> 00:50:46.584]  They advertised to come here.
[00:50:46.944 --> 00:50:49.265]  Biden said, when I become president, immediately surge the border.
[00:50:50.705 --> 00:50:51.326]  I want you to come.
[00:50:53.453 --> 00:50:56.255]  So yes, it's too big to arrest, like too big to fail.
[00:50:56.816 --> 00:50:57.837]  Too big to charge.
[00:50:58.537 --> 00:51:02.981]  And my dad always explained to me, he said, the big crooks run the system, he goes, they're gonna steal big.
[00:51:03.001 --> 00:51:04.702]  And he wasn't telling me to steal, he was saying steal.
[00:51:04.722 --> 00:51:07.064]  He said, if you're gonna steal, steal big.
[00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:13.069]  And he wasn't telling me to do that, he was saying that's their rule.
[00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:15.390]  Because then they're protected.
[00:51:16.872 --> 00:51:17.092]  So...
[00:51:18.547 --> 00:51:22.949]  You've got criminal groups in the bureaucracy and the corporations that have gotten away with more and more and more.
[00:51:23.249 --> 00:51:24.710]  They're generationally handing down power.
[00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:25.551]  They're very arrogant.
[00:51:25.571 --> 00:51:30.653]  They're full of hubris and chutzpah and bravado and everything else.
[00:51:31.954 --> 00:51:33.315]  And they believe they're above the law.
[00:51:33.395 --> 00:51:41.559]  That's why you see Strzok in there making those weird crazy faces he made when he was being exposed for lying to Congress and looking at him like a demon and smiling and baring his teeth.
[00:51:42.139 --> 00:51:43.400]  They believe they've got the country.
[00:51:44.844 --> 00:51:48.508]  And so the average person that's sworn a note, they're compartmentalized and they don't see through walls.
[00:51:48.548 --> 00:51:52.672]  They don't see what's compartmentalized by the Department of Justice or the Defense Department.
[00:51:52.692 --> 00:51:55.254]  They're trying to do their job, but they're being told they can't do it.
[00:51:56.215 --> 00:51:57.917]  They can only see what's going on in their area.
[00:51:59.582 --> 00:52:01.543]  It's the same in corporations, the same in medicine.
[00:52:02.383 --> 00:52:07.064]  They did the same thing with Big Pharma and the poison shots and lying about the origin and lying about all the heart attacks.
[00:52:07.945 --> 00:52:14.527]  And they paid the hospitals that would take the money, $53,000 for every person they intubated, another $10,000 if they died.
[00:52:14.887 --> 00:52:18.688]  Or put them on Remdesivir that turns your kidneys off and liver off.
[00:52:19.588 --> 00:52:20.869]  That's another microcosm of it.
[00:52:20.929 --> 00:52:24.030]  So, that's how they do it, is the Justice Department.
[00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:27.411]  And the Inspector Generals go after good people and protect bad people.
[00:52:28.561 --> 00:52:31.683]  The CIA set up the National Security Act in 47, got Congress to pass it.
[00:52:31.983 --> 00:52:35.505]  They were secret and were above the law, and out of that grew everything you see.
[00:52:36.826 --> 00:52:46.192]  It goes back even to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, given the private bank's control, then the 47 Act, and then in the late 70s, setting up these Inspector Generals that are above the law.
[00:52:46.872 --> 00:52:48.774]  Now they want Inspector Generals to be over the Supreme Court?
[00:52:49.354 --> 00:52:50.535]  That's his fourth branch of government?
[00:52:52.036 --> 00:52:53.056]  That's how this is happening.
[00:52:53.176 --> 00:52:55.778]  So, that's what's going on.
[00:52:58.325 --> 00:53:10.333]  And that's a good still image of him, but if you pull up the Peter Strzok gif, it shows him making the different faces, and he literally is baring his teeth and looking like a gremlin or something.
[00:53:12.015 --> 00:53:13.075]  All right, so that's an excellent question.
[00:53:13.736 --> 00:53:16.217]  He just brought me more in, so we'll try to move quick now.
[00:53:18.459 --> 00:53:26.805]  Big Sal up north on X. Big Sal up north
[00:53:29.364 --> 00:53:30.525]  On X. Let's show people their handle.
[00:53:32.066 --> 00:53:34.388]  Yeah, I mean, I've not really weighed on me, but I've certainly wargamed it a lot.
[00:53:34.408 --> 00:53:34.808]  Here's the deal.
[00:53:34.828 --> 00:53:35.389]  I can't give up.
[00:53:35.409 --> 00:53:36.369]  I can't give in.
[00:53:36.389 --> 00:53:37.210]  I can't sell out.
[00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.650]  It's not my nature.
[00:53:59.977 --> 00:54:08.447]  But I do get guilty sometimes that it's brought a tax on my parents and family, but they're all behind me, and they realize there's no future anyways if we don't beat this thing.
[00:54:09.308 --> 00:54:15.855]  So when you understand that kind of running from this, particularly how far along we are, that it puts you in a worse position.
[00:54:16.827 --> 00:54:17.688]  For the general public.
[00:54:17.708 --> 00:54:27.155]  For me, physically or economically, yeah, you can say it's not safe and, you know, they've taken money away from me, but I had some money piled up as a backup to fight them knowing it was coming.
[00:54:27.896 --> 00:54:29.217]  So, I mean, it was a pleasure.
[00:54:29.377 --> 00:54:30.077]  I mean, I don't care.
[00:54:31.018 --> 00:54:34.140]  I mean, I'm wearing a $15, $20 shirt.
[00:54:34.961 --> 00:54:36.982]  I'm wearing, you know, $80 shoes.
[00:54:38.223 --> 00:54:40.185]  I got a belt that I've had 25 years on.
[00:54:40.205 --> 00:54:43.868]  I mean, I wear a Rolex as my dad gave it to me like 18 years ago.
[00:54:43.888 --> 00:54:45.089]  I never even wore a watch before that.
[00:54:45.748 --> 00:54:46.168]  I like it.
[00:54:46.809 --> 00:54:47.169]  I've worn it.
[00:54:47.249 --> 00:54:48.150]  It's not a status symbol.
[00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:56.196]  I, you know, got a 12-year-old truck and a 10-year-old car, and I love them.
[00:54:57.688 --> 00:55:01.971]  So, I mean, you know, I got gas for the car and food to eat, and it means nothing to me.
[00:55:01.991 --> 00:55:03.852]  What matters is standing up to these people.
[00:55:04.212 --> 00:55:08.995]  And so Zapata said it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees.
[00:55:09.075 --> 00:55:13.418]  In my experience, people that live on their knees die much quicker and are slaves.
[00:55:13.438 --> 00:55:19.282]  People that fight on their feet live a lot better lives and only die once, it's been said.
[00:55:19.362 --> 00:55:21.684]  So, no.
[00:55:23.004 --> 00:55:29.228]  I mean, I can look back in hindsight and say, oh, I got manipulated on that, or I put out some false info there, I got set up, but that's part of the process of learning.
[00:55:29.528 --> 00:55:31.009]  We're not God, we're not close.
[00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:36.213]  So, all the bad things that have happened to me made me stronger.
[00:55:36.233 --> 00:55:37.754]  That which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:55:37.794 --> 00:55:38.694]  Frederick Nietzsche, it's true.
[00:55:39.975 --> 00:55:48.581]  I have stared into the abyss too long, and it's had some problems there, so I stare at the Holy Spirit and God, and more and more, and then I don't let the enemy get me down.
[00:55:49.767 --> 00:55:51.468]  I don't fight the Globalists because I hate them.
[00:55:51.708 --> 00:55:56.030]  I fight them because I'm defending the people and my children that live in a world with your children.
[00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:57.831]  Your children are as important as my children.
[00:55:59.432 --> 00:56:00.613]  And that's really where it is.
[00:56:01.093 --> 00:56:02.754]  I like being a Boy Scout.
[00:56:02.794 --> 00:56:03.654]  I like being a good guy.
[00:56:03.674 --> 00:56:04.394]  I like being strong.
[00:56:04.414 --> 00:56:05.335]  I've been strong my whole life.
[00:56:06.876 --> 00:56:08.937]  And that's what I do.
[00:56:10.297 --> 00:56:11.098]  Like my ancestors.
[00:56:13.019 --> 00:56:13.699]  And that's another thing.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.121]  There's a timelessness to this.
[00:56:17.201 --> 00:56:18.842]  And I want people to look back on what I did.
[00:56:19.704 --> 00:56:20.785]  And it'd be an example to them.
[00:56:22.786 --> 00:56:24.087]  I live on through those before me.
[00:56:24.248 --> 00:56:25.889]  Those coming after me live on through me.
[00:56:26.429 --> 00:56:27.270]  And so on forever.
[00:56:29.071 --> 00:56:32.734]  John Daw- Dawon?
[00:56:33.114 --> 00:56:33.935]  D-A-W-O-N?
[00:56:34.956 --> 00:56:35.276]  Dawon?
[00:56:35.316 --> 00:56:35.836]  John Dawon?
[00:56:37.638 --> 00:56:38.879]  And there's his handle right there.
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:46.665]  I want to know to what extent Biden, Kamala, and the rest of the left are complicit in the Chinese and Russian subversion
[00:56:48.035 --> 00:56:48.716]  We're good to go.
[00:57:03.024 --> 00:57:05.727]  That's a very good question and very complex.
[00:57:06.528 --> 00:57:08.630]  The Chi-Coms are a globalist project.
[00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:17.140]  The CIA put Mao Zedong into power in 1949, set up Chiang Kai-shek, gave him rifles without firing pins, killed the U.S.
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:19.763]  military people like John Birch that stayed behind to try to fight.
[00:57:22.386 --> 00:57:26.508]  China was then opened up after they exterminated 80 million of their people by the globalists in the 70s.
[00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:33.172]  One-sided deals were set up to make them the dominant manufacturer in the world, and a secret deal with the globalists that was since made public in the 90s.
[00:57:33.833 --> 00:57:39.656]  Then about 15 years ago, the Chinese began to double-cross the globalists, so a split began that became public about 10 years ago.
[00:57:40.917 --> 00:57:49.122]  And now communist China has a lot of agents and double agents in the West, but the West, the globalists have begun to, and the Anglo-American establishment, to cut them off.
[00:57:50.393 --> 00:58:07.661]  So the fissure has widened and it's public knowledge that Saudi Arabia, China and others are the biggest funders of governments of the carbon taxes and the anti-fracking and the anti-gas and the anti-coal to cut off our energy because we have more than anybody.
[00:58:09.176 --> 00:58:11.498]  And to make us buy our oil from them.
[00:58:11.518 --> 00:58:16.521]  Remember how Biden shut down all the drilling permits and the Keystone Pipeline and all the rest of that?
[00:58:17.181 --> 00:58:18.962]  And shut down ANWR and all the rest of it?
[00:58:19.803 --> 00:58:20.443]  And the offshore?
[00:58:21.624 --> 00:58:25.707]  And then said we're gonna buy it from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
[00:58:27.068 --> 00:58:28.989]  And then he drained most of our strategic reserves.
[00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:29.529]  So, yeah.
[00:58:31.891 --> 00:58:38.275]  There are a lot of different special interests, but the globalist banks, the military industrial complex, the Israel lobbies, heavily allied with China,
[00:58:39.787 --> 00:58:41.949]  And double deals to screw America in that.
[00:58:42.449 --> 00:58:45.371]  Trump did try to actually stop that, cut it back a lot.
[00:58:47.292 --> 00:58:52.636]  And so, people like, Walz is a dyed-in-the-wool communist Chinese agent.
[00:58:53.037 --> 00:58:56.199]  A lot of them just take money from him, and they're like a vending machine.
[00:58:56.759 --> 00:59:00.762]  But he is a communist Chinese agent, so is Swallow's Wells, so is Feinstein, a bunch of other ones.
[00:59:01.963 --> 00:59:05.886]  And so it's not your idea, it's a fact.
[00:59:07.244 --> 00:59:11.625]  When we, quote, liberated Iraq in 2003, the second time, China came in and got the oil.
[00:59:13.406 --> 00:59:14.266]  Trump's like, why are we doing that?
[00:59:14.286 --> 00:59:15.387]  We're going to take the oil and give it to us.
[00:59:15.427 --> 00:59:19.328]  Well, America is the muscle setting up this world government.
[00:59:19.548 --> 00:59:22.249]  And while our power has decreased, we transfer our power to others.
[00:59:22.749 --> 00:59:26.430]  But then insiders, again, about 15 years ago, said actually China is double-crossing us.
[00:59:27.811 --> 00:59:29.591]  So the global started putting pressure on China.
[00:59:30.191 --> 00:59:31.072]  These are really good questions.
[00:59:31.092 --> 00:59:32.172]  I could go on for hours on that one.
[00:59:37.156 --> 00:59:46.121]  If Trump is not allowed to win, what do you see happening the first six months and the year after?
[00:59:48.702 --> 00:59:49.483]  Man, these are good.
[00:59:51.043 --> 00:59:56.526]  In fact, I'm going to take some of these questions this week and do like 30 minutes a piece on them because I kind of have to hurry through this so it's not as powerful.
[01:00:01.081 --> 01:00:04.322]  They are going to completely open the border, legalize all the illegals publicly.
[01:00:04.342 --> 01:00:05.143]  They've already announced that.
[01:00:05.223 --> 01:00:05.883]  Feinstein.
[01:00:07.063 --> 01:00:07.564]  Schumer.
[01:00:08.644 --> 01:00:09.464]  Feinstein's dead.
[01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:12.906]  Pelosi, the other female cryptkeeper.
[01:00:13.186 --> 01:00:13.666]  Confuse them.
[01:00:15.047 --> 01:00:19.489]  They're going to just flood more fentanyl, stage false flags, massive censorship.
[01:00:20.589 --> 01:00:23.030]  Arrest a bunch of broadcasters saying they work for Russia.
[01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:27.592]  Accelerate war with Russia.
[01:00:29.938 --> 01:00:33.662]  Just, you know, force more transgenderism on autistic kids.
[01:00:34.243 --> 01:00:36.525]  Everything you see tripled.
[01:00:40.149 --> 01:00:41.110]  Just hell on earth.
[01:00:43.293 --> 01:00:44.394]  Massive inflation.
[01:00:45.695 --> 01:00:51.521]  More giant 300 plus billion dollar fake environmental boondoggles giving money to themselves.
[01:00:52.637 --> 01:00:55.638]  For ridiculous windmills and solar crap.
[01:00:56.879 --> 01:00:58.660]  I mean, that's just so hellish.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.261]  That should be a question to listeners.
[01:01:00.281 --> 01:01:01.441]  I mean, there's so many angles to that.
[01:01:02.282 --> 01:01:03.182]  They're coming at your guns.
[01:01:03.202 --> 01:01:04.683]  They said they're going to ban all semi-auto.
[01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:06.944]  I mean, just hell on earth.
[01:01:12.607 --> 01:01:19.390]  Logan at real underscore Logan 23 says, do you think the deep state are going to kill Biden after his term is done?
[01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:28.333]  Probably because he's so embarrassing with so many criminal charges, then they could just blame him after he's dead for everything.
[01:01:28.353 --> 01:01:30.514]  He'll probably die on his own as well.
[01:01:31.234 --> 01:01:33.355]  But I don't think he and his son-in-law are for the earth.
[01:01:33.395 --> 01:01:35.136]  I would definitely think they'll probably kill Hunter.
[01:01:37.056 --> 01:01:40.158]  They could kill him now and say a Trump supporter did it for sympathy for Kamala.
[01:01:40.338 --> 01:01:41.158]  They could kill Kamala.
[01:01:41.358 --> 01:01:44.059]  They're already rearranging him like Jack- Jack Charisma of Titanic.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:45.900]  John at
[01:01:47.276 --> 01:01:55.002]  Simmeron Road asks, if Biden pardons Hunter, then resigns and Harris steps into the presidency, how will the election be certified?
[01:01:56.543 --> 01:02:00.105]  Well, they don't follow the law anyway, so they'll just do whatever they want.
[01:02:00.145 --> 01:02:02.127]  And if you question it, that's supposedly illegal now.
[01:02:03.027 --> 01:02:04.228]  I saw a CNN piece Friday.
[01:02:04.248 --> 01:02:04.889]  I had to record it.
[01:02:04.909 --> 01:02:05.870]  I'm probably going to play it tomorrow.
[01:02:06.616 --> 01:02:11.601]  And it's like, there's an election official in Arizona who's gonna retire after this because everybody's so mean to him.
[01:02:11.621 --> 01:02:16.645]  He has PTSD and there was no fraud anywhere and it's all made up and total evil and blah blah blah.
[01:02:16.685 --> 01:02:23.392]  I mean, in key Republican districts, in key Republican precincts, all the ballots were two inches too short and didn't work.
[01:02:23.472 --> 01:02:27.776]  I mean, they caught him doing that and indicted a guy a month ago in Houston, one of the top election people.
[01:02:28.016 --> 01:02:32.220]  I mean, and then you're like, oh, you're not supposed to question, they're election deniers.
[01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:47.260]  Steve Pagano says, I also want to ask, is what we know about the Earth and how it's structured false or fact?
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:53.884]  I'm a Christian, so I believe we are soul beings of this Earth and God made us as a test for us to follow God and be humble.
[01:02:54.344 --> 01:02:58.647]  I think these aliens are demons that control the elite.
[01:03:00.928 --> 01:03:02.850]  Yeah, I mean, I think the Earth's a sphere.
[01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:03.310]  I know it is.
[01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:04.231]  I've seen the other planets.
[01:03:04.291 --> 01:03:04.731]  I watch it.
[01:03:07.193 --> 01:03:28.466]  When the sun forms it gets thrown off and liquid spinning molten hot and forms into a sphere just like if you do that with molten metal when you're welding and you throw the arc up and some of the molten metal goes up in the air by the time it hits the ground it's little balls but yeah that's what the aliens are that's demons and absolutely I agree with
[01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:32.751]  Nacho Taco.
[01:03:32.831 --> 01:03:37.897]  Let's say we wake up in two weeks and the internet doesn't work and the financial system is turned off.
[01:03:37.937 --> 01:03:38.578]  What do we do?
[01:03:38.918 --> 01:03:39.599]  How do we prepare?
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.341]  Now till then.
[01:03:41.461 --> 01:03:47.228]  Well, the first thing you do is ask that incredibly... I mean, I cannot believe how good these questions are.
[01:03:47.808 --> 01:03:50.491]  I mean, I'm not doing this service because every one of them I could do an hour on.
[01:03:50.531 --> 01:03:51.833]  I mean, this is amazing.
[01:03:54.147 --> 01:03:55.187]  And you know I'm not hyping that.
[01:03:55.247 --> 01:03:58.749]  Everybody's watching is going, damn, those are all really good questions.
[01:04:05.531 --> 01:04:06.852]  I have to table that question.
[01:04:06.872 --> 01:04:08.052]  I mean, because here's the deal.
[01:04:09.253 --> 01:04:16.235]  I don't want to sit there and try to do justice or something like that and give a half-assed answer.
[01:04:16.676 --> 01:04:22.558]  Because before I even read that this morning, these questions, I was already thinking about it the last few days.
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:27.723]  Because you see people's different perspectives when I read the comments on X. I love it.
[01:04:28.344 --> 01:04:30.526]  And then the calls we get and the guests we have.
[01:04:30.546 --> 01:04:33.869]  And I get such mental feedback from that.
[01:04:34.429 --> 01:04:36.771]  Like, I don't ask questions on X like, what do you think of this?
[01:04:36.992 --> 01:04:40.935]  Because that's an engagement thing to get people to sit there and then nobody's reading it.
[01:04:40.955 --> 01:04:44.298]  I mean, I'm from talk radio world where I call, I want to hear your calls.
[01:04:44.558 --> 01:04:45.059]  It's great.
[01:04:45.179 --> 01:04:45.559]  I love it.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.561]  And it gets me thinking.
[01:04:48.615 --> 01:04:48.695]  I'm
[01:05:10.114 --> 01:05:12.315]  There's no real way to attack this properly.
[01:05:12.355 --> 01:05:13.275]  It would take a full hour.
[01:05:13.315 --> 01:05:15.776]  It would take me hours to write up all my ideas on it.
[01:05:16.577 --> 01:05:20.078]  Because if I just give it a little peck at it, it doesn't do anything.
[01:05:21.799 --> 01:05:26.361]  It'd be like taking an egg you want to fry and just barely tapping on the edge of the pan.
[01:05:27.121 --> 01:05:30.703]  Or, you know, putting a steak on the grill at 150 degrees.
[01:05:30.783 --> 01:05:31.523]  It's not going to cook.
[01:05:31.603 --> 01:05:39.327]  It's just... That kind of question, all these questions make my brain go... Not lack of information, too much.
[01:05:42.239 --> 01:05:43.480]  I'm not going to half-ass that.
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:48.204]  A bunch of these.
[01:05:48.264 --> 01:05:55.410]  I just, I did half-ass some of these because... I mean, I gave you good answers, I think, but... Alright, here's the microcosm, and I'll do it this way.
[01:05:57.132 --> 01:05:58.013]  Kirk Elliott was on.
[01:05:58.893 --> 01:06:03.998]  He talked about mainline analysts and showed them saying they think silver goes up 60% in the next four months.
[01:06:05.009 --> 01:06:06.069]  We're not sure that's going to happen.
[01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:07.510]  Let's say they're only half right.
[01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:08.030]  That's 30%.
[01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:11.591]  It's already up, like, the last year, like, 50% or something.
[01:06:11.631 --> 01:06:12.391]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:06:13.051 --> 01:06:13.392]  Look it up.
[01:06:14.392 --> 01:06:15.232]  And I see the commenters.
[01:06:15.292 --> 01:06:16.933]  I say, hey, where do you think silver's going?
[01:06:16.953 --> 01:06:18.113]  And I'm really reading it and thinking.
[01:06:18.133 --> 01:06:20.534]  And most of the commenters actually nailed what I was thinking.
[01:06:20.554 --> 01:06:21.814]  That's what the knowledge of the crowd.
[01:06:22.254 --> 01:06:24.335]  They're like, we think silver, by the end of the year, is 50.
[01:06:25.135 --> 01:06:27.316]  And, you know, gold's 2,500.
[01:06:27.356 --> 01:06:30.157]  And I'm like, that's exactly what I wrote on the piece of paper.
[01:06:30.177 --> 01:06:34.258]  We're sitting in the kitchen last night, drinking ice water.
[01:06:35.337 --> 01:06:35.797]  At 1 a.m.
[01:06:35.837 --> 01:06:39.459]  before I went to bed, I'm like, a whole bunch of the comments were exactly what I was thinking.
[01:06:40.979 --> 01:06:42.060]  That's what's uncanny about it.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:49.923]  But then I saw some of the commenters going, you can't eat gold or silver during collapse, you need a food dehydrator.
[01:06:50.383 --> 01:06:51.503]  Well, of course you're right.
[01:06:52.784 --> 01:07:04.048]  A garden, food dehydration, some storable foods, a gun, guns, knowing how to use it, fishing poles, knowing how to use them, friends and family you can trust, property to bug out to if you don't already live in the country.
[01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:07.791]  If your family's spread out during an emergency, where you're going to rally point to?
[01:07:08.211 --> 01:07:09.071]  Satellite phones.
[01:07:11.131 --> 01:07:12.292]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[01:07:12.332 --> 01:07:15.412]  Solar panels, charging blocks to hold the power.
[01:07:16.433 --> 01:07:19.093]  That's just at that level.
[01:07:20.854 --> 01:07:22.674]  And people go, oh, you'll get arrested for gold and silver.
[01:07:22.734 --> 01:07:29.675]  No, that was in 33 when they ordered it turned in for paper and the Nixon finally left it because everybody had gold and silver.
[01:07:29.715 --> 01:07:31.696]  The money was gold and silver.
[01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:35.603]  A quarter was silver until like the 80s and they took more and more out.
[01:07:35.643 --> 01:07:36.303]  There's nothing now.
[01:07:38.284 --> 01:07:46.126]  Well, you can go, you know, old, you know, but you can go to banks and stuff and ask for a bunch of change and people dig through it and find a quarter that's worth 50 bucks or whatever.
[01:07:46.446 --> 01:07:51.908]  Not just because of the silver, but because of the date or a penny that's worth, you know, 500 bucks or a thousand or ten, you know, because of the collectability.
[01:07:52.588 --> 01:07:54.589]  There's a lot of little, you know, diamonds out there, but
[01:07:59.901 --> 01:08:07.228]  With only a couple, less than, a couple percentage of people own silver or gold, the system isn't coming after that when things go down.
[01:08:07.248 --> 01:08:09.270]  They're going to just force you onto a central bank digital currency.
[01:08:09.610 --> 01:08:12.753]  And then there'll still be places that cash in the gold and silver, whatever the currency is.
[01:08:13.313 --> 01:08:14.975]  You obviously don't be able to know you got a bunch of it.
[01:08:15.295 --> 01:08:18.318]  I have basically none, because I've been through bankruptcy.
[01:08:18.939 --> 01:08:20.961]  And in my last divorce, with my first wife,
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:26.821]  You know, I traded gold and silver myself.
[01:08:26.941 --> 01:08:28.962]  Bought most of it at like $300 to $400 an ounce.
[01:08:29.563 --> 01:08:30.143]  It was up at $2,000.
[01:08:32.044 --> 01:08:35.425]  And in the divorce, it was worth over $2 million.
[01:08:37.186 --> 01:08:39.327]  But my ex-wife wouldn't agree to selling it.
[01:08:39.347 --> 01:08:42.108]  Right when the divorce started, the gold was starting to go down.
[01:08:42.449 --> 01:08:43.589]  It took a year to finish the divorce.
[01:08:43.629 --> 01:08:44.970]  And by then, it had lost half its value.
[01:08:46.050 --> 01:08:47.351]  And then that got cashed out.
[01:08:48.638 --> 01:08:51.620]  So I've kind of got out of it at that point because it was in a down market since then.
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.302]  The last few years I've been wanting to get a sponsor.
[01:08:53.322 --> 01:08:57.265]  I couldn't find one because, you know, people are charging too much.
[01:08:57.285 --> 01:08:58.446]  Gold and silver is a great thing to get into.
[01:08:58.466 --> 01:09:10.355]  You just got to find somebody that's good, like Kirk Kelly Precious Metals, kpm.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.
[01:09:15.373 --> 01:09:16.734]  People are like, oh, you can't eat that.
[01:09:16.754 --> 01:09:17.454]  No, no, no, no.
[01:09:17.574 --> 01:09:18.014]  Oh, come on.
[01:09:18.655 --> 01:09:23.818]  Skills, knowing how to fix an engine, knowing how to grow a farm, knowing how to hunt, knowing how to fight.
[01:09:23.978 --> 01:09:25.379]  I mean, there's so many valuable things.
[01:09:25.419 --> 01:09:31.042]  Having, you know, cars that run well that aren't modern, that don't have kill switches in them, like all the new cars for 15 years do.
[01:09:31.262 --> 01:09:32.122]  Now it's law they have them.
[01:09:33.463 --> 01:09:34.924]  I mean, there's a lot goes into this.
[01:09:34.984 --> 01:09:36.365]  Number one, a relationship with God.
[01:09:37.625 --> 01:09:38.786]  Have the people you can count on.
[01:09:38.806 --> 01:09:42.808]  I mean, you asked a question.
[01:09:42.848 --> 01:09:43.969]  I guess I'm kind of answering it.
[01:09:46.775 --> 01:09:51.018]  You better have all these shows and other shows and important things on hard drives downloaded.
[01:09:51.259 --> 01:09:52.980]  That knowledge will be more valuable in the future.
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:55.182]  These predictions will be more valuable if we don't stop them.
[01:09:55.782 --> 01:09:57.143]  Then we go into the full resistance mode.
[01:10:00.426 --> 01:10:01.486]  You gotta be thinking about this.
[01:10:01.506 --> 01:10:02.527]  There's no perfect answer.
[01:10:04.589 --> 01:10:05.109]  Great question.
[01:10:05.129 --> 01:10:06.270]  I'll get back to more of that later.
[01:10:06.751 --> 01:10:07.051]  All right.
[01:10:08.132 --> 01:10:09.713]  Chase brought me a bunch of other questions.
[01:10:11.774 --> 01:10:12.375]  I mean, look at this one.
[01:10:12.435 --> 01:10:14.737]  I mean, this is the big enchilada right here.
[01:10:16.792 --> 01:10:18.654]  What are the chances Trump makes it to office?
[01:10:18.694 --> 01:10:21.717]  How can my family and I prepare if Kamala becomes president?
[01:10:22.397 --> 01:10:24.520]  I mean, just, that's kind of like the other question.
[01:10:27.102 --> 01:10:30.605]  That's by Lisa Stea.
[01:10:30.625 --> 01:10:36.191]  That's Lisa S-T-A-I on X. Damian Hayes.
[01:10:37.012 --> 01:10:38.093]  Damian B. Bitches.
[01:10:38.613 --> 01:10:40.175]  Or B. Star Bitches.
[01:10:43.012 --> 01:10:44.433]  What are your thoughts on the BRICS system?
[01:10:44.453 --> 01:10:44.934]  I mean, look at that.
[01:10:44.954 --> 01:10:45.894]  That's a huge question.
[01:10:45.954 --> 01:10:46.675]  Truth exposed.
[01:10:47.275 --> 01:10:50.818]  Interested in the DOJ indictment of Tenet Media.
[01:10:50.858 --> 01:10:52.280]  I covered that Friday, but I'll do it more.
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:53.841]  Okay, I gotta stop there.
[01:10:55.922 --> 01:11:06.551]  Tomorrow night on the Sunday Show, I will answer these other questions, 4 to 6 p.m., and I will take two of the other big ones that were too big to answer, and I'll answer those.
[01:11:07.092 --> 01:11:07.972]  I gotta think about these.
[01:11:08.032 --> 01:11:09.734]  I mean, these are brain twisters.
[01:11:11.738 --> 01:11:13.539]  Not because the answer isn't easy.
[01:11:13.579 --> 01:11:14.740]  There's so many answers.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.962]  And then you gotta ask, what is the most important?
[01:11:17.002 --> 01:11:18.122]  That's the brain twister.
[01:11:19.443 --> 01:11:25.167]  So... I wanna... That was exhausting for my little pea brain.
[01:11:25.708 --> 01:11:26.949]  Because I'm trying to give you good answers.
[01:11:26.969 --> 01:11:27.749]  I'm trying to do it quick.
[01:11:27.769 --> 01:11:29.891]  Alright, let's set that aside.
[01:11:31.071 --> 01:11:31.792]  Whoo!
[01:11:32.953 --> 01:11:33.293]  Man!
[01:11:36.055 --> 01:11:37.075]  It's different than a headache.
[01:11:37.115 --> 01:11:38.816]  My brain is like burning right now.
[01:11:39.196 --> 01:11:40.236]  And I bet yours is too.
[01:11:40.316 --> 01:11:47.698]  See, the average leftist, be man or woman, mainly they're women, because women want to conform, it's genetic, they want to just have a good, they want to trust people.
[01:11:48.498 --> 01:11:53.119]  That's why old white women are the main Democrats and main communists around the world, and women in general.
[01:11:53.459 --> 01:11:54.179]  Not putting women down.
[01:11:54.699 --> 01:11:55.659]  Women that are awake are the best.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:01.141]  But they want to just hear a simple story that makes them feel good, and they don't want to know all this stuff.
[01:12:01.161 --> 01:12:02.661]  They don't want to try to figure it all out.
[01:12:03.749 --> 01:12:05.550]  And the politicians will give you real simple answers.
[01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:06.771]  Everything's going to be free!
[01:12:08.672 --> 01:12:11.134]  With a couple of strings attached, a couple of hooks in you.
[01:12:11.154 --> 01:12:13.776]  And of course, you never get what they said you would.
[01:12:15.657 --> 01:12:17.719]  But here, we're really trying to figure it all out.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.441]  And I'm a very good generalist, and I know my audience is.
[01:12:21.462 --> 01:12:22.482]  It's just general knowledge.
[01:12:23.743 --> 01:12:27.366]  And I've been around 50 orbits of the sun, so I've had a lot of experience.
[01:12:27.386 --> 01:12:29.427]  But that's why I love taking your calls.
[01:12:29.467 --> 01:12:30.728]  You bring up points way better than mine.
[01:12:31.108 --> 01:12:32.369]  And these questions are just phenomenal.
[01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.350]  All right.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:36.581]  I just hit an hour and 12 minutes.
[01:12:40.703 --> 01:12:49.927]  This next thing I'm gonna hit is so massive, it is undoubtedly the most important COVID news we ever covered.
[01:12:50.467 --> 01:12:53.528]  You probably heard me say that 20, 30 times the last four years, four and a half years.
[01:12:54.809 --> 01:12:57.610]  That's because there's always something new, even bigger, as we learn more.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:03.302]  And again, this information, you're gonna go, we already know all this.
[01:13:03.482 --> 01:13:10.004]  Yeah, but in my view, all the pieces are together on this, and this is open and shut.
[01:13:11.145 --> 01:13:17.927]  And now we've got so much data, I just got chills, that it's 100% premeditated, and it means they're about to hit us and hit us hard.
[01:13:19.008 --> 01:13:27.811]  Now, the easiest way to describe this is a little more sophisticated than just the classic binary weapon, but it's a two-phase preparatory weapon.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.421]  Or it's a prep phase and then mass kill phase.
[01:13:33.282 --> 01:13:36.923]  And the prep phase is so deadly that it's killed 35 million people.
[01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:38.464]  By the way, it was on InfoWars.
[01:13:38.984 --> 01:13:40.505]  I reposted it on X last night.
[01:13:40.525 --> 01:13:41.405]  I didn't see it in my stack.
[01:13:42.946 --> 01:13:45.247]  It was probably there, but I moved so quick today.
[01:13:45.267 --> 01:13:46.927]  Will you guys reprint me?
[01:13:46.947 --> 01:13:48.808]  I put it on X last night or was it this morning?
[01:13:48.828 --> 01:13:49.428]  It was last night.
[01:13:50.008 --> 01:13:56.011]  Major new study in JAMA, Journal of American Medical Association,
[01:13:58.735 --> 01:14:08.398]  What I was telling you that actuaries were saying six months ago, because all the guys we have on, like, Kirsch and others are very conservative, so they're like, 11 to 20 million debt in insurance company numbers.
[01:14:08.598 --> 01:14:09.639]  But Edward Dowd's like, it's over 20.
[01:14:09.739 --> 01:14:10.739]  He's the guy that first broke it.
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:13.800]  And he had the, he said, I got top insurance actuaries about to come out.
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:15.741]  I'm like, the top guy came out, the master.
[01:14:15.761 --> 01:14:18.222]  You know, it was like, congressional testimony.
[01:14:20.783 --> 01:14:21.503]  Two years ago.
[01:14:22.763 --> 01:14:25.344]  So, the number's 35 million.
[01:14:28.342 --> 01:14:29.583]  So, so print me that, guys.
[01:14:30.083 --> 01:14:31.784]  35 million.
[01:14:31.804 --> 01:14:33.884]  35 million, and that number's six months old!
[01:14:34.745 --> 01:14:38.406]  But now the Journal of American Medical Association's reporting on it.
[01:14:39.107 --> 01:14:40.767]  It's just, oh yeah, 35 million dead!
[01:14:42.788 --> 01:14:45.710]  That was just... the first tap.
[01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:48.651]  This is a double tap, and the first tap just preps people.
[01:14:49.311 --> 01:14:51.092]  And it's so strong, it's killed 35 million!
[01:14:51.152 --> 01:14:51.332]  So...
[01:14:57.410 --> 01:15:07.434]  I like it in the movie Alien, where the face sucker jumps on you, sends a proboscis down your esophagus and lays an egg in your belly, it eats whatever's in your stomach, and then busts out of your chest.
[01:15:07.934 --> 01:15:09.674]  So phase one was the face sucker.
[01:15:13.015 --> 01:15:14.976]  Phase two's the birth of the baby.
[01:15:17.097 --> 01:15:18.177]  Go to Alien 1977-78, pull up the, uh,
[01:15:21.644 --> 01:15:25.406]  Alien, original alien birth scene, original alien movie.
[01:15:25.806 --> 01:15:28.908]  Let me show you that, with audio, just to illustrate this.
[01:15:29.589 --> 01:15:41.896]  So, they hit us with the virus to get everybody scared, so they have the cover to give you a quote, gene therapy, they call it vaccine, to get into your body.
[01:15:46.644 --> 01:15:49.926]  And now it's gestating in you, erasing your immune system.
[01:15:50.526 --> 01:15:53.208]  So any new virus comes along, you can't really defend yourself.
[01:15:53.408 --> 01:15:55.589]  Or if it has spike protein added, you dead.
[01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:57.250]  Or close to it.
[01:15:58.731 --> 01:16:00.912]  So you think a face sucker on you is bad?
[01:16:04.294 --> 01:16:05.654]  You about to give birth to the baby.
[01:16:06.975 --> 01:16:07.455]  Let me show you.
[01:16:07.515 --> 01:16:13.599]  You just gotta go to YouTube and type in, um, original alien
[01:16:15.233 --> 01:16:16.353]  Bust out of chest.
[01:16:17.253 --> 01:16:17.794]  Here, I'll do it.
[01:16:19.154 --> 01:16:19.634]  YouTube.
[01:16:20.894 --> 01:16:21.634]  Original.
[01:16:23.255 --> 01:16:23.715]  Alien.
[01:16:23.975 --> 01:16:24.735]  You know, let's do this.
[01:16:24.775 --> 01:16:26.695]  We'll, we'll air a special report.
[01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:27.796]  Take our time here.
[01:16:28.996 --> 01:16:33.317]  And, uh, because I want to come back and nail this properly.
[01:16:33.957 --> 01:16:43.639]  But when we archive this later, put a note, I want to take my first little intro there where I'm describing this, and then we're going to put it on everything else I say after this.
[01:16:45.455 --> 01:17:03.840]  But now let's go ahead and get to clip eight, Crowder undercover, DOJ Affairs Chief.
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:06.021]  Trump has now responded.
[01:17:06.061 --> 01:17:07.081]  That's clip nine.
[01:17:08.792 --> 01:17:17.697]  So, Trump has now responded to the head spokesman of the DOJ in the Southern District of New York, arguably the most powerful DOJ and the most corrupt after D.C.
[01:17:18.337 --> 01:17:19.458]  I mean, I can't decide which one's worse.
[01:17:19.538 --> 01:17:21.759]  It's like twin to dragon with two heads.
[01:17:22.099 --> 01:17:24.601]  They're both basically equally evil and political.
[01:17:24.981 --> 01:17:27.002]  That's where most of the persecution comes out of there, actually.
[01:17:27.182 --> 01:17:28.063]  It's kind of moved to D.C.
[01:17:28.083 --> 01:17:28.403]  more now.
[01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:30.364]  It's kind of close second, really, if I think about it.
[01:17:30.924 --> 01:17:31.664]  Yeah, it's the worst.
[01:17:32.345 --> 01:17:33.666]  Because the history is the worst.
[01:17:33.986 --> 01:17:34.766]  It's done way more evil.
[01:17:34.786 --> 01:17:35.647]  It's just that D.C.
[01:17:35.707 --> 01:17:37.448]  is kind of getting up to its level now.
[01:17:38.490 --> 01:17:42.192]  And Trump has now responded to that, and the guy said he did say that, so it's a real video.
[01:17:42.232 --> 01:17:45.955]  But it's totally politically motivated to go after Trump, and all of it.
[01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:51.338]  So here is that report, and then we're gonna come back and hit the giant news, stay with us.
[01:17:53.119 --> 01:18:04.927]  Today there was a story about somebody in Southern District who's highly respected, knocking the hell out of both of those cases, say it's an embarrassment they were allowed to be brought
[01:18:05.868 --> 01:18:06.909]  That's you, Mug Club.
[01:18:06.949 --> 01:18:13.334]  Just revealed today, and I hope you're going to do a story because it's a big story, Southern District of New York.
[01:18:35.849 --> 01:18:40.173]  And this is a very highly respected group of people.
[01:18:41.514 --> 01:18:44.036]  He said it was a disgrace that that case was brought.
[01:18:44.216 --> 01:18:47.338]  It was a disgrace that the case was brought in front of Mershawn.
[01:18:47.458 --> 01:18:49.540]  This guy's probably going to try to hunker him up.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.121]  It's going to be ugly.
[01:18:51.141 --> 01:18:52.722]  They're so obsessed with getting him.
[01:18:52.742 --> 01:18:53.263]  Who is that?
[01:18:53.283 --> 01:18:54.284]  The case is a disgrace.
[01:18:54.344 --> 01:18:56.005]  It should have never been brought.
[01:19:04.761 --> 01:19:05.902]  Should have never been brought.
[01:19:06.142 --> 01:19:06.582]  There you go.
[01:19:06.642 --> 01:19:09.384]  You saw the fruits of your labor.
[01:19:10.285 --> 01:19:16.930]  And like I've said, millions of dollars and months and months of work have gone into it, and it's just the beginning.
[01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:27.657]  Hey, take this level of corruption and apply it to, without giving it away, some of the other biggest stories of your lifetime or recent American history.
[01:19:28.257 --> 01:19:31.700]  Maybe stories that hampered your life in a way that could be irreparable.
[01:19:32.898 --> 01:19:33.880]  We've got those coming, too.
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:36.764]  We are holding back some surprises.
[01:19:37.666 --> 01:19:38.447]  And we're gonna be dripping them.
[01:19:39.388 --> 01:19:40.350]  It's not an October surprise.
[01:19:41.091 --> 01:19:44.476]  It's a week-after-week-in-September and week-after-week-in-October surprise.
[01:19:44.937 --> 01:19:46.399]  And I do have ulterior motives.
[01:19:47.168 --> 01:19:47.828]  Everyone here does.
[01:19:49.009 --> 01:19:52.910]  We've been holding it back because we know that the media will deny it.
[01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:59.393]  We've been holding back the truth because we wanted to make sure that we hit hard when it counts.
[01:19:59.713 --> 01:20:01.033]  Because you've shown us your support.
[01:20:01.053 --> 01:20:02.814]  You can choose to support anyone you want.
[01:20:02.854 --> 01:20:03.534]  You can choose.
[01:20:03.774 --> 01:20:09.616]  There aren't that many ways in 2024 that you can actually put your money where your mouth is, right?
[01:20:09.636 --> 01:20:11.817]  We're not out there sacrificing animals anymore.
[01:20:12.117 --> 01:20:13.558]  Most of you don't have to go to war.
[01:20:14.578 --> 01:20:15.599]  You can vote.
[01:20:17.253 --> 01:20:20.194]  You can volunteer your time, and you can vote with your dollar.
[01:20:21.334 --> 01:20:28.237]  And you voted with your dollar here and... I mean, thank God you've seen the results.
[01:20:28.857 --> 01:20:33.339]  In believing that your dollar is supporting something you believe in, deserve better.
[01:20:33.379 --> 01:20:34.499]  We don't take it lightly.
[01:20:34.699 --> 01:20:38.960]  Yep, we screw up, and yep, we're childish sometimes because it's a comedy show.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:39.461]  I get it.
[01:20:40.761 --> 01:20:42.182]  But we do not take it lightly.
[01:20:42.402 --> 01:20:46.063]  When we understand that you could choose to watch anyone,
[01:20:47.944 --> 01:20:50.746]  When we are broadcasting and you could choose to support anyone.
[01:20:51.367 --> 01:20:56.371]  Everyone's asking for a dollar and we don't ask to be the only place or even the first place that you consider a dollar.
[01:20:57.672 --> 01:21:07.440]  But we do ask that you compare us with other entities out there right now where it's hard to know what's true and it's hard to know the motivations and compare the results.
[01:21:07.941 --> 01:21:11.204]  The motive here is the country.
[01:21:12.148 --> 01:21:16.351]  The motive is this is too important of a time in our country to give up.
[01:21:16.431 --> 01:21:18.693]  People often ask, should you get down in the dirt with the left?
[01:21:19.994 --> 01:21:21.135]  No, not if you mean lie.
[01:21:22.576 --> 01:21:25.938]  No, not if you mean destroy someone's life when you know that it's false.
[01:21:26.859 --> 01:21:28.240]  But should we fight fire with fire?
[01:21:29.921 --> 01:21:34.225]  As far as intensity and consistency, yeah.
[01:21:35.185 --> 01:21:38.288]  Our motive here right now is to affect enough hearts and minds.
[01:21:39.076 --> 01:21:45.063]  And to break apart this legacy media paradigm that the truth can break through.
[01:21:45.904 --> 01:21:52.672]  And between now and election, and on election night, we are going to do it with you, with consistency and intensity.
[01:21:53.723 --> 01:21:58.345]  If we haven't made the case yet, allow us to continue making it now through election night.
[01:21:59.025 --> 01:22:01.666]  Because they are still, and by they, who do I mean?
[01:22:02.426 --> 01:22:03.066]  Democrats.
[01:22:03.707 --> 01:22:03.967]  Yep.
[01:22:04.647 --> 01:22:07.468]  The leftist institutions that exist.
[01:22:07.508 --> 01:22:12.070]  The entertainment, media, Democrat industrial complex.
[01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:14.156]  They are going to silence you.
[01:22:14.656 --> 01:22:19.759]  They are going to try and lie, either about you, or about him, about us.
[01:22:20.319 --> 01:22:27.543]  And when we continue with intensity and consistency, and it will break through, they are going to try and cheat.
[01:22:28.543 --> 01:22:31.425]  Good thing we have a contingency plan for that, too.
[01:22:33.646 --> 01:22:38.668]  Because we've also invested millions into the election livestream of the century, November 5th, 2024.
[01:22:41.817 --> 01:22:42.898]  We've covered our bases.
[01:22:43.859 --> 01:22:44.660]  That's because of you.
[01:22:46.002 --> 01:22:48.424]  Do I have motivations here?
[01:22:49.025 --> 01:22:49.485]  Politically?
[01:22:49.746 --> 01:22:50.446]  I wouldn't say so.
[01:22:50.587 --> 01:22:51.347]  I would say morally?
[01:22:52.909 --> 01:22:55.872]  You won't hear me deny it for a second.
[01:22:56.053 --> 01:22:56.473]  You know why?
[01:22:56.974 --> 01:22:57.694]  Because you wouldn't.
[01:22:58.916 --> 01:22:59.817]  And in that something,
[01:23:01.673 --> 01:23:06.855]  You know why I just aired somebody else's network's information and why I aired something asking for support by somebody else?
[01:23:07.595 --> 01:23:08.796]  Because I like Steven Crowder.
[01:23:08.956 --> 01:23:09.576]  I love his team.
[01:23:09.616 --> 01:23:10.136]  I love him.
[01:23:10.737 --> 01:23:12.037]  And I know the inside baseball.
[01:23:12.057 --> 01:23:14.098]  Because I'm friends with him.
[01:23:15.178 --> 01:23:23.702]  And I know the fact that he is putting everything he's got into the fight.
[01:23:25.062 --> 01:23:27.083]  And the footage that
[01:23:28.254 --> 01:23:33.298]  They've been getting with their investigative team is having a huge effect on the enemy for all of us.
[01:23:33.498 --> 01:23:34.219]  We're all in this together.
[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:41.965]  And the judge in the criminal case was going to convict, he's already convicted, was going to put Trump in jail for a year on the 18th.
[01:23:42.025 --> 01:23:49.572]  Now he's pushed it back to after the election because of that information coming out the day before.
[01:23:51.894 --> 01:23:54.075]  So we're having an effect.
[01:23:54.115 --> 01:23:55.336]  People ask what solutions are.
[01:23:55.537 --> 01:23:56.617]  Undercover journalism,
[01:23:57.515 --> 01:24:09.105]  Stuff like James O'Keefe does, things like Crowder's doing, getting the manifesto, exposing the UN, head spokesperson saying we're criminal, we don't do any work, Trump's gonna destroy us, 99% of what we do is horrible.
[01:24:10.606 --> 01:24:11.427]  That was a week ago!
[01:24:12.188 --> 01:24:18.913]  That's what Crowder's investigative team's doing, and I know for a fact, I'll leave it at that, that they're literally spending everything they've got in the fight.
[01:24:19.794 --> 01:24:20.795]  That's total commitment.
[01:24:22.165 --> 01:24:25.026]  That's champions in our fight, and we are a champion.
[01:24:25.066 --> 01:24:27.126]  I ask you to look at what we've done, what you've done supporting us.
[01:24:27.727 --> 01:24:47.652]  And I ask you to go to drjonesnaturals.com, our sponsor, and get great nanosilver products and great nanosilver toothpaste with iodine and tea tree and no fluoride, and get the next little foundational energy, and get the Cabochill, and get the Top Brain, incredible nootropic, and get next little foundational energy that isn't a stimulant but works like one with no letdown because it powers your cells and is incredible and cleans them out at the same time.

[01:25:45.555 --> 01:25:45.975]  I don't think so.
[01:26:06.431 --> 01:26:15.216]  Together in a concise, hard-hitting report that'll be up on X a few hours after the show's gone live, and then it's up to you to get it out to people.
[01:26:15.617 --> 01:26:23.762]  And now I'm gonna shift gears into that, and I'm, this particular graphic, I feel like I've gotta be lined up perfectly between these things.
[01:26:23.802 --> 01:26:31.927]  It's like a subconscious thing, like, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
[01:26:34.482 --> 01:26:56.190]  Ladies and gentlemen, scientists that head up the UK government's vaccine program and other independent scientists around the world have come out now for almost four years, right before and during and after the so-called COVID mRNA vaccine rollout,
[01:26:57.682 --> 01:27:11.307]  And have documented in major study after major study that when you take the injections, it begins to erase your immune system and turns off your key white blood cells that train the other white blood cells with antibodies on what to go after.
[01:27:13.889 --> 01:27:22.292]  And now, Professor Brett Weinstein, a great scientist, has collated this information and cracked the code on what the globalists are really doing.
[01:27:24.173 --> 01:27:27.054]  Now, this is extremely horrifying information.
[01:27:27.952 --> 01:27:31.555]  Most actuaries have 25 to 35 million dead from the shots so far.
[01:27:34.136 --> 01:27:44.203]  There was a Journal of American Medicine report just came out, we'll be getting to, that I posted on X last night, that confirms up to 35 million dead from the shots.
[01:27:45.184 --> 01:27:56.592]  That, though, was just the opening salvo of turning off your immune system, but it's so strong it has all these other effects of blood clots, myocarditis, infertility, cancer, turbo cancer.
[01:27:58.049 --> 01:27:59.150]  That it's killed so many people.
[01:27:59.170 --> 01:28:00.111]  It attacks fertility.
[01:28:01.812 --> 01:28:02.833]  The list goes on and on.
[01:28:04.214 --> 01:28:11.359]  But what it really does is turn off your immune system to any other virus or bacteria that hasn't even gained a function, that hasn't been weaponized.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:18.184]  But if a spike protein is then added to a regular cold or flu or hemorrhagic virus, like Ebola,
[01:28:19.247 --> 01:28:24.132]  It then automatically turns everything completely off, not just stunned or partially off.
[01:28:24.532 --> 01:28:42.550]  Now unlike HIV virus that eats T lymphocyte blood cells, kills them, goes into them and replicates, this just turns off the most important white blood cell that Dr. Brett Weinstein is going to be breaking down here in a moment.
[01:28:44.281 --> 01:28:50.109]  But first, I'm going to show you Dr. David Bower, who heads up the Maine Institute in the UK.
[01:28:50.129 --> 01:28:50.750]  He's Canadian.
[01:28:52.232 --> 01:28:54.414]  Almost four years ago, when the shots were rolling out,
[01:28:55.675 --> 01:29:03.937]  Admitting that by the third shot it turns off your immune system, and then saying now you'll need these mRNA shots for everything, even though it continues to destroy it.
[01:29:04.837 --> 01:29:07.918]  So it erases your immune system so you need more of it, though that erases it.
[01:29:08.678 --> 01:29:10.139]  Vaccines aren't supposed to do that.
[01:29:10.379 --> 01:29:17.041]  A real vaccine is attenuated virus or whatever the pathogen is, your body learns to beat it without fighting the replication, so it recognizes it.
[01:29:17.061 --> 01:29:17.941]  It still has side effects.
[01:29:18.421 --> 01:29:21.822]  That's why they changed the definition of vaccines four years ago to anything they put in your body.
[01:29:24.309 --> 01:29:25.310]  These are not vaccines.
[01:29:26.471 --> 01:29:32.476]  So, this is so massive, and if this gets out to enough people, it'll change the world.
[01:29:32.536 --> 01:29:42.585]  The globalists will know they can't launch the next weapon, and the people getting sick because their immune system's been erased will understand what happened, and there are ways to try to turn it back on.
[01:29:46.169 --> 01:29:48.511]  But so far, four years in, it's not turning back on.
[01:29:48.671 --> 01:29:50.373]  They found some ways to mitigate it, and that Dr.
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:53.001]  Peter McCullough and others on about it.
[01:29:53.421 --> 01:30:01.045]  So, we're trying to educate you about what's happened, the crime of the century, the crime of history, premeditated scientific assault, eugenics depopulation.
[01:30:01.065 --> 01:30:06.028]  You have to understand, this is just the opening salvo, the primer in a binary weapon.
[01:30:06.048 --> 01:30:13.172]  A binary weapon hits you with one thing, and when you get hit with the second thing, like a binary poison, it takes both to kill you.
[01:30:13.412 --> 01:30:15.633]  So the folks that haven't been hit with the first one don't get sick.
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.361]  And it's their own minions they're targeting.
[01:30:20.681 --> 01:30:21.242]  The sheeple.
[01:30:21.262 --> 01:30:22.122]  Just take the shot.
[01:30:22.182 --> 01:30:22.783]  Just trust us.
[01:30:23.003 --> 01:30:23.663]  You won't get sick.
[01:30:23.683 --> 01:30:24.484]  You won't spread COVID.
[01:30:24.744 --> 01:30:25.385]  Biden said it.
[01:30:25.505 --> 01:30:26.105]  Rachel Maddow.
[01:30:26.265 --> 01:30:26.846]  All a lie.
[01:30:28.186 --> 01:30:41.956]  A good analogy of a binary weapon, a biological binary weapon like this is, would be the alien sucker that comes out of the egg in the original alien that jumps on your face, paralyzes you, puts a proboscis down your esophagus, and lays an egg in you.
[01:30:44.773 --> 01:30:45.714]  That's the first phase.
[01:30:45.934 --> 01:30:51.398]  Then it hatches, eats what's in your stomach, grows, and then busts out of your chest and scurries off.
[01:30:52.299 --> 01:30:57.243]  There are actually a lot of bugs that do do this and lay their larvae inside a stunned beetle or other bug.
[01:30:57.664 --> 01:30:59.265]  There's some wasps and other things that do this.
[01:30:59.625 --> 01:31:00.466]  Dirt daubers do this.
[01:31:00.486 --> 01:31:05.190]  They take spiders and put them in their nest and then lay their eggs on the spiders and the eggs and eat them alive.
[01:31:05.210 --> 01:31:06.871]  That's where they got the idea for it.
[01:31:08.853 --> 01:31:11.375]  So, this is an example of a binary weapon.
[01:31:12.483 --> 01:31:20.408]  And I'm gonna lay it out and get to two parts we put together from Dr. Brett Weinstein on Joe Rogan's show last week.
[01:31:20.468 --> 01:31:24.350]  He was here last Friday, not this Friday, yesterday, but last Friday.
[01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.930]  We went to dinner.
[01:31:25.391 --> 01:31:26.771]  He was gonna expose this on Joe.
[01:31:28.292 --> 01:31:31.594]  It's already confirmed, but he just put the final pieces together, and I totally agree with him.
[01:31:31.874 --> 01:31:32.455]  It's a fact.
[01:31:34.296 --> 01:31:35.757]  And then Joe did his two-hour podcast.
[01:31:35.797 --> 01:31:39.279]  It went super viral, but not this particular part that is the key to everything.
[01:31:40.814 --> 01:31:47.517]  So I've set this up here, but since I talked about Alien, for those that may not have seen it, here's a clip from the film and then I'll drill into the facts.
[01:31:58.885 --> 01:31:59.565]  What's the matter?
[01:31:59.945 --> 01:32:01.526]  The food ain't that bad, baby.
[01:32:01.546 --> 01:32:02.066]  What's wrong?
[01:32:26.997 --> 01:32:27.397]  Who's that?
[01:32:27.938 --> 01:32:28.458]  A train!
[01:32:28.478 --> 01:32:32.081]  Get on!
[01:32:32.121 --> 01:32:32.502]  Get on!
[01:32:56.195 --> 01:32:56.816]  Don't touch it!
[01:32:56.836 --> 01:32:57.798]  Don't touch it!
[01:33:25.319 --> 01:33:40.629]  Alright, so they release a virus that's man-made with a spike protein on it, five different viruses, they scare you, they create a supposed vaccine for it that the Pentagon has four companies, make a vaccine, two of them mRNA, two of them virus vector, that order the body to produce the spike protein that's highly toxic.
[01:33:42.190 --> 01:33:48.074]  But then your body, instead of reacting to it in the future, turns off to it, believing it's part of the body.
[01:33:48.895 --> 01:33:51.517]  Then any new virus you create doesn't even have to be weaponized,
[01:33:52.731 --> 01:33:56.795]  Because just by putting a spike protein on it, it turns off the immune system.
[01:33:56.835 --> 01:34:00.578]  But any other regular virus, your immune system is already turned way down.
[01:34:02.039 --> 01:34:05.562]  Now, that is a classical binary biological weapon.
[01:34:06.843 --> 01:34:13.549]  They prime you, they lay the egg, it replicates, and then it busts out.
[01:34:14.970 --> 01:34:19.895]  And it kills you slowly regardless, but when they're ready, they release new pathogens with a spike protein on them,
[01:34:20.743 --> 01:34:21.503]  And they got you.
[01:34:22.183 --> 01:34:23.104]  That's the big effect.
[01:34:23.844 --> 01:34:35.588]  So, here is the head of the government slash private number one vaccine research facility in the UK.
[01:34:35.628 --> 01:34:39.249]  It's in the top three in the world, along with Johns Hopkins and a few others.
[01:34:40.069 --> 01:34:40.949]  This is the director.
[01:34:41.449 --> 01:34:43.290]  Let's take the bug down so you can see his full name there.
[01:34:47.148 --> 01:34:54.733]  David Bauer, almost four years ago, on Canadian TV, but he's speaking from the UK though, he's Canadian, spills the beans on vax effects.
[01:34:55.794 --> 01:35:01.218]  And notice he says, by the time you've taken three of the mRNA, you basically don't have an immune system.
[01:35:02.198 --> 01:35:03.079]  So this is known.
[01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:06.661]  So wait, they give you something that erases your immune system, how does that help you?
[01:35:06.681 --> 01:35:10.484]  And now, people have all these colds in the summer they never did, and stuff's worse in the winter.
[01:35:11.044 --> 01:35:11.925]  They say it's not COVID.
[01:35:13.046 --> 01:35:14.486]  Because they've attacked you.
[01:35:14.506 --> 01:35:18.847]  The regular virus can turn down your immune system, but the shots are innumerably worse.
[01:35:19.308 --> 01:35:26.850]  And Moderna is just 3.2 to 3.3, depending on how much they give you, more of the solution that's in the Pfizer.
[01:35:27.370 --> 01:35:29.990]  And the Pentagon directed them to do it.
[01:35:30.010 --> 01:35:35.012]  And Obama launched the program when he got in at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and with the University of Texas, Galveston.
[01:35:36.452 --> 01:35:39.913]  And it was a big scandal in 2014, so they moved it to Wuhan.
[01:35:41.385 --> 01:35:45.926]  And now, Governor of Minnesota Tim Walz has been discovered to be heavily involved in as well.
[01:35:45.966 --> 01:35:46.486]  Of course he is.
[01:35:46.506 --> 01:35:47.547]  This is all a cult.
[01:35:47.607 --> 01:35:48.827]  Google, all of them invested.
[01:35:48.847 --> 01:35:49.287]  Facebook.
[01:35:51.688 --> 01:35:51.988]  Show.
[01:35:52.888 --> 01:35:54.129]  Yeah, that's him at Imperial College.
[01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:58.190]  The role of RNA structure in replication of influenza and coronaviruses.
[01:35:58.890 --> 01:36:01.371]  So he heads up the main institute.
[01:36:02.191 --> 01:36:02.851]  Put it back on screen.
[01:36:02.871 --> 01:36:03.431]  I'll read it to you.
[01:36:06.892 --> 01:36:08.312]  The Francis Crick Institute.
[01:36:08.352 --> 01:36:10.033]  That's the main advisor to the UK government.
[01:36:11.237 --> 01:36:12.500]  One of the main advisors of the UN.
[01:36:12.941 --> 01:36:19.275]  Now here he is saying everything that Professor Brett Weinstein, Dr. Weinstein, is about to say.
[01:36:19.877 --> 01:36:20.277]  Here it is.
[01:36:21.854 --> 01:36:33.817]  The key message from our finding is that we found that recipients of the Pfizer vaccine, those who've had two doses, have about five to six fold lower amounts of neutralizing antibodies.
[01:36:33.857 --> 01:36:43.299]  Now these are the sort of gold standard private security antibodies of your immune system, which block the virus from getting into your cells in the first place.
[01:36:44.199 --> 01:36:46.541]  So we found that that's less for people with two doses.
[01:36:46.621 --> 01:36:55.007]  We've also found that for people with only one dose of the Pfizer jab, that they are less likely to have high levels of these antibodies in their blood.
[01:36:55.708 --> 01:37:03.114]  And perhaps most importantly for all of us going forward, is that we see that the older you are, the lower your levels are likely to be.
[01:37:03.654 --> 01:37:09.719]  And the time since you've had your second jab, as that time goes on, the lower your levels are also likely to be.
[01:37:10.796 --> 01:37:18.378]  Now, we're live right now with a lot of viewers on Saturday, but when this goes up as an archive to Band Up Video and Alex Jones, it'll get a million or two viewers.
[01:37:19.179 --> 01:37:20.159]  It needs a hundred million.
[01:37:20.179 --> 01:37:20.919]  It needs a billion.
[01:37:20.939 --> 01:37:25.841]  Because I'm about to show you, almost four years later, the aftermath.
[01:37:25.881 --> 01:37:27.702]  He's like, well, we're going to have to deal with this now.
[01:37:27.942 --> 01:37:30.142]  You're not going to have an immune system now because you took this.
[01:37:30.322 --> 01:37:31.083]  What the hell?
[01:37:31.323 --> 01:37:32.603]  That's what AIDS creates.
[01:37:32.643 --> 01:37:33.864]  That's what HIV creates.
[01:37:33.904 --> 01:37:34.584]  That's AIDS.
[01:37:35.544 --> 01:37:37.465]  And now they call it vaccine-induced AIDS.
[01:37:37.525 --> 01:37:37.945]  Look it up.
[01:37:39.258 --> 01:37:45.844]  But they're like, hey everybody, we're cutting kids' genitals off to tell them it's stylish and cool, mainly targeting mentally retarded children and autistic.
[01:37:47.225 --> 01:37:47.645]  Hey!
[01:37:48.646 --> 01:37:49.767]  We're erasing your immune system.
[01:37:49.807 --> 01:37:50.708]  It's a new way of life.
[01:37:50.728 --> 01:37:51.949]  Hey, kids have heart attacks now.
[01:37:51.969 --> 01:37:52.469]  It's normal.
[01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:53.290]  Billboards.
[01:37:54.591 --> 01:37:55.332]  Sides of buses.
[01:37:55.372 --> 01:37:56.033]  TV ads.
[01:37:56.473 --> 01:37:57.053]  All over the world.
[01:37:58.194 --> 01:37:59.976]  Hey, everybody dies early now.
[01:38:00.016 --> 01:38:01.077]  Hey, standard of living's down.
[01:38:01.097 --> 01:38:01.998]  Hey, we don't live as long now.
[01:38:03.632 --> 01:38:05.833]  World population for the first time since the Black Plague's plunging.
[01:38:05.913 --> 01:38:06.753]  They're just, it's normal!
[01:38:06.813 --> 01:38:07.354]  It's fun!
[01:38:07.394 --> 01:38:09.054]  Hey, let's jump off a cliff together, lemmings!
[01:38:12.656 --> 01:38:16.858]  Now, again, there are literally hundreds of studies on this now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:19.019 --> 01:38:21.240]  So, let's get right into it.
[01:38:24.301 --> 01:38:28.683]  SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination exposes latent HIV in lab studies.
[01:38:28.963 --> 01:38:29.023]  Oh!
[01:38:31.135 --> 01:38:31.975]  Yeah, it makes it fire up.
[01:38:31.995 --> 01:38:33.896]  It's like it makes cancers that were dormant turn back on.
[01:38:35.357 --> 01:38:36.938]  mRNA basically creates cancer.
[01:38:37.938 --> 01:38:38.478]  And they admit that.
[01:38:39.959 --> 01:38:41.740]  So, the first clip's powerful.
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:44.801]  And we've added documents and information to this.
[01:38:44.821 --> 01:38:46.402]  Chase Geiser did a fabulous job.
[01:38:46.822 --> 01:38:47.723]  Worked overnight to do it.
[01:38:48.463 --> 01:38:50.684]  So this is augmented from the Joe Rogan Show.
[01:38:51.244 --> 01:38:54.146]  And the 200 interview went viral, reached tens of millions of people.
[01:38:54.906 --> 01:38:57.847]  Clips went viral, but I've seen none of them from the show on this.
[01:38:57.887 --> 01:38:59.288]  People just didn't know what they were hearing.
[01:39:01.954 --> 01:39:04.535]  They've erased people that took the shots of immune systems.
[01:39:04.555 --> 01:39:05.695]  That was back when it started.
[01:39:05.895 --> 01:39:06.515]  They'd only taken two.
[01:39:06.555 --> 01:39:08.195]  It's up to 10 now for some people.
[01:39:08.775 --> 01:39:09.776]  They're going on the 11th now.
[01:39:10.116 --> 01:39:12.236]  They want three for newborn babies by nine months.
[01:39:12.776 --> 01:39:15.077]  First day you're born, three months, nine months.
[01:39:16.977 --> 01:39:19.878]  And the kids are going to have autoimmune diseases and people won't know what did it.
[01:39:19.918 --> 01:39:21.378]  I mean, this is so sick.
[01:39:22.778 --> 01:39:24.259]  Let's erase your baby's immune system.
[01:39:24.659 --> 01:39:28.620]  You know, a mother's milk the first few weeks gives you colostrum and all of her immunity is given to you.
[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:30.360]  It's a liquid vaccination from your mother.
[01:39:32.964 --> 01:39:35.285]  They try to get mothers not to do that, and of course the kids are sickly.
[01:39:35.545 --> 01:39:36.786]  And their brains don't develop as big.
[01:39:37.066 --> 01:39:37.786]  Literally, they're smaller.
[01:39:39.307 --> 01:39:40.508]  Formulas full of corn syrup.
[01:39:41.428 --> 01:39:43.429]  Everything they can do to make us dumb.
[01:39:43.469 --> 01:39:44.729]  The fluoride, the water, all of it.
[01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.890]  And now this.
[01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:47.471]  Erase your immune system at birth.
[01:39:47.771 --> 01:39:51.433]  The FDA announced last week, and the CDC, we're gonna give the kids three shots.
[01:39:53.494 --> 01:39:53.814]  Babies.
[01:39:55.276 --> 01:40:02.780]  Even after it's proven to not work and erase your immune system, they're just doubling down because the board of the FDA is run by former Pfizer, Moderna, and Merck heads.
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:09.983]  So the first Bret Weinstein gets into this, and then it's part two that is over-the-top mega bombshell.
[01:40:11.544 --> 01:40:19.048]  We'll play the first part, take notes, then we'll play the second part, and then we're gonna put these out as one part on X tonight.
[01:40:21.209 --> 01:40:21.469]  Okay?
[01:40:22.449 --> 01:40:24.030]  So this is the full report right now.
[01:40:24.751 --> 01:40:29.095]  For everybody else out there, send them the Weinstein Report.
[01:40:29.135 --> 01:40:32.337]  Except, if you don't walk folks through it, they're watching Joe Rogan.
[01:40:32.357 --> 01:40:37.602]  15 million people last time I checked watched it so far in the last four or five days on Spotify, and no one even picked up on this?
[01:40:43.947 --> 01:40:45.168]  This is the key.
[01:40:45.769 --> 01:40:46.790]  Right there in front of you.
[01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:47.951]  This is their next move.
[01:40:50.250 --> 01:40:51.931]  That's how they can release regular mousepox.
[01:40:51.991 --> 01:40:54.012]  It gets hardly anybody sick and so there's gonna be mass death.
[01:40:54.232 --> 01:40:56.874]  People that have taken the shots won't have an immune system for it.
[01:40:57.534 --> 01:40:59.715]  They don't have to make new weaponized viruses.
[01:40:59.875 --> 01:41:01.996]  They can release the regular ones and you'll get sick or die.
[01:41:02.957 --> 01:41:03.277]  See?
[01:41:03.797 --> 01:41:04.818]  The crime they've committed?
[01:41:05.298 --> 01:41:07.799]  What is more valuable than your immune system other than your soul?
[01:41:07.819 --> 01:41:14.343]  Somebody could steal your car, steal your house, you know, but are they still you or still your kids?
[01:41:14.363 --> 01:41:16.024]  Well, that's, you know, this is big!
[01:41:18.365 --> 01:41:19.446]  This is so huge!
[01:41:20.575 --> 01:41:21.195]  Here's part one.
[01:41:22.315 --> 01:41:33.257]  Why is it we are dealing with a simultaneous panic over Eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile virus?
[01:41:34.478 --> 01:41:39.418]  Well, that is a very odd coincidence.
[01:41:40.819 --> 01:41:48.040]  One thing that's true is the last, the last panic was over COVID.
[01:41:49.296 --> 01:41:55.479]  And the response to COVID was massive vaccination with the mRNA shots, as you know.
[01:41:56.479 --> 01:42:10.206]  The mRNA shots, for anybody who got two or more, triggered the production of something called IgG4, which I don't know if we've talked about it before, but IgG4 is the immune system's own message to itself to turn itself down.
[01:42:10.226 --> 01:42:11.626]  Okay?
[01:42:11.907 --> 01:42:12.627]  Why two or more?
[01:42:13.632 --> 01:42:14.692]  That's just empiric.
[01:42:15.012 --> 01:42:23.254]  I don't know whether anybody expected this result, but when it was pursued, that was just the number at which we could detect the presence of IgG4.
[01:42:23.354 --> 01:42:24.114]  So not with one?
[01:42:24.734 --> 01:42:25.334]  Not with one.
[01:42:25.815 --> 01:42:28.755]  I'm not saying there wasn't any with one, but we don't detect it with one shot.
[01:42:29.295 --> 01:42:33.056]  And then two produces some effect, and the more shots you get, the bigger the effect.
[01:42:34.796 --> 01:42:36.317]  Does that explain why
[01:42:38.464 --> 01:42:43.948]  Disease itself appears to have changed in the last year or two, right?
[01:42:44.129 --> 01:42:46.170]  Why are people so sick during the summer?
[01:42:47.411 --> 01:42:47.571]  Right?
[01:42:47.591 --> 01:42:49.733]  Do you remember even five years ago?
[01:42:50.113 --> 01:42:50.393]  Right.
[01:42:51.194 --> 01:42:52.155]  There were summer colds.
[01:42:52.315 --> 01:42:55.738]  People remarked on them because it was weird when you got sick during the summer, right?
[01:42:55.878 --> 01:42:56.859]  Oh, I got a summer cold.
[01:42:57.299 --> 01:43:00.522]  But people weren't sick with lots of different things during the summer.
[01:43:00.582 --> 01:43:03.824]  In general, you were, you know, fine during the summer.
[01:43:03.864 --> 01:43:05.686]  And then when you got sick when...
[01:43:06.726 --> 01:43:11.028]  When it was, you know, cold out and you were driven indoors and that was just the pattern.
[01:43:11.048 --> 01:43:11.428]  Right.
[01:43:11.828 --> 01:43:22.552]  So something's going on that people are much more susceptible and it just so happens that we've watched a pattern where people have been multiply injected with something that we know turns their immune system down.
[01:43:24.032 --> 01:43:34.976]  Why are we not asking the question if the reason that we may have a problem with West Nile virus and Eastern equine encephalitis is the result of a self-inflicted wound?
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:35.880]  Right?
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.400]  We should at least be asking that question.
[01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:41.321]  Instead, we are still recommending that goddamn COVID shot.
[01:43:42.162 --> 01:43:48.803]  Well, and then look at a guy like Fauci, who was one of the rare few that was hospitalized, and he's had six shots.
[01:43:49.563 --> 01:43:50.183]  According to him.
[01:43:51.704 --> 01:43:54.724]  Yeah, I gotta say, as soon as we get to Fauci, I just don't believe anything.
[01:43:54.825 --> 01:43:55.405]  I don't know.
[01:43:55.685 --> 01:44:05.007]  I'm agnostic as to whether or not the dude took any shots, whether he's... I don't know what's going on, because there's so much garbage surrounding that guy, and
[01:44:06.121 --> 01:44:09.364]  What he thinks and what he did that I just can't accept any of it at face value.
[01:44:10.045 --> 01:44:11.786]  But here's what I don't understand.
[01:44:11.986 --> 01:44:16.090]  Let's look at the Eastern equine encephalitis issue.
[01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:21.675]  They are now considering curfews, right?
[01:44:21.955 --> 01:44:28.921]  They're going to start eroding civil liberties over the presence of this disease.
[01:44:29.081 --> 01:44:30.062]  One person has died.
[01:44:31.783 --> 01:44:32.483]  It's only one person?
[01:45:02.083 --> 01:45:10.610]  We're still giving people a shot that causes their immune systems to turn down, so can we at least stop doing that before we start panicking over new diseases?
[01:45:10.670 --> 01:45:21.559]  Because it sure looks like we are creating vulnerability to new diseases over here, recommending mRNA shots that people don't need, and then we are, you know,
[01:45:23.157 --> 01:45:28.201]  We're also recommending it to people that already have natural immunity, which is the most bizarre thing.
[01:45:28.501 --> 01:45:28.942]  Of course.
[01:45:29.382 --> 01:45:30.163]  The most bizarre.
[01:45:30.383 --> 01:45:32.544]  Because there's no science that backs that up.
[01:45:32.884 --> 01:45:37.067]  It doesn't make any sense, and yet we're still saying to these people, you gotta get your boosters.
[01:45:37.528 --> 01:45:39.930]  This IGG4, what does that stand for?
[01:45:42.583 --> 01:45:43.003]  I.G.
[01:45:43.284 --> 01:45:44.584]  means immunoglobulin.
[01:45:44.625 --> 01:45:46.386]  That's synonym for antibody.
[01:45:46.946 --> 01:45:47.546]  I.G.G.
[01:45:48.447 --> 01:45:49.488]  I.G.G.
[01:45:49.788 --> 01:45:51.589]  is a major class of antibody.
[01:45:51.629 --> 01:45:53.851]  There are something like five major classes.
[01:45:53.931 --> 01:45:57.773]  And then I.G.G.4 is a subclass that turns the immune system down.
[01:45:58.274 --> 01:46:04.198]  And why does this... What is it about the mRNA shots that causes this to happen?
[01:46:04.738 --> 01:46:05.058]  We don't know.
[01:46:06.519 --> 01:46:10.042]  We just know measurably people who have more of them have this.
[01:46:10.162 --> 01:46:10.322]  Yes.
[01:46:11.229 --> 01:46:12.535]  And it's alarming.
[01:46:15.914 --> 01:46:17.435]  And there's a lot of studies on this.
[01:46:17.515 --> 01:46:20.696]  Professor Weinstein said that there's not evidence of the first shot.
[01:46:20.756 --> 01:46:28.578]  No, I just showed you the head of the Crick Institute, the top in the world, saying as they roll the shots out that one does, but three, it's gone.
[01:46:28.718 --> 01:46:39.482]  And what it does is, in the studies, it doesn't kill the trainer tees, that's what they're talking about, that create the IgG4, that programs the other one.
[01:46:39.542 --> 01:46:40.142]  It's the general.
[01:46:40.783 --> 01:46:41.583]  It tells them what to do.
[01:46:44.142 --> 01:46:45.643]  HIV went out and just killed him in general.
[01:46:45.784 --> 01:46:46.684]  This just turns him off.
[01:46:48.446 --> 01:46:53.070]  So, again, all premeditated, all there.
[01:46:53.971 --> 01:46:55.372]  And you saw the last minute of that clip.
[01:46:55.432 --> 01:46:58.595]  That did go viral where he's talking about we're giving somebody something that doesn't even work.
[01:46:59.096 --> 01:47:01.458]  But people are missing the forest for the trees here.
[01:47:01.998 --> 01:47:04.661]  And clip two is where he nails it and really lays it down.
[01:47:04.701 --> 01:47:05.702]  He obviously said more at dinner.
[01:47:05.742 --> 01:47:07.323]  But I already know this is all true.
[01:47:07.523 --> 01:47:08.464]  We've been saying this for years.
[01:47:09.065 --> 01:47:10.386]  And now you see the effects of it.
[01:47:11.837 --> 01:47:15.679]  And they admit it doesn't work for COVID, but oh, take it, so everything makes you sick.
[01:47:16.719 --> 01:47:18.600]  That's the cover for them getting this into your body.
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:23.882]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to the next clip, part two of Professor Brett Weinstein.
[01:47:25.122 --> 01:47:36.187]  COVID, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, appears to have emerged from laboratory work that was dual-use.
[01:47:37.988 --> 01:47:40.829]  Dual-use work means bioweapons research.
[01:47:42.745 --> 01:47:51.366]  The excuse, so it's called dual use because you're only allowed to do bioweapons research if it's also research that might contribute to public health.
[01:47:53.087 --> 01:47:55.907]  So the excuse is, oh, we're working, you know, what did they tell us?
[01:47:55.927 --> 01:48:07.869]  They said, well, the gain-of-function research is so that we can create pathogens and learn what to do about them before they find themselves out of nature and we don't know what to do, right?
[01:48:08.509 --> 01:48:09.870]  This is a nonsense story.
[01:48:11.110 --> 01:48:11.910]  It's not
[01:48:13.930 --> 01:48:14.116]  It is.
[01:48:15.330 --> 01:48:23.736]  It is not coherent to think that by creating some pathogen in a laboratory that you're going to learn something about pathogens that might leap out of nature.
[01:48:23.776 --> 01:48:27.638]  For one thing, pathogens leaping out of nature is a difficult thing for them to do.
[01:48:27.878 --> 01:48:29.960]  They have to do two tricks and it's not easy.
[01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:31.341]  They have to infect a person.
[01:48:31.361 --> 01:48:32.542]  Okay?
[01:48:32.802 --> 01:48:34.043]  Some pathogens will do that.
[01:48:34.443 --> 01:48:38.726]  But then, before that person dies or gets better, they have to jump from one person to the next.
[01:48:39.286 --> 01:48:42.228]  Very, very few are ever going to jump that gap.
[01:48:42.468 --> 01:48:44.530]  So it's not a big risk.
[01:48:46.552 --> 01:48:53.762]  And then, if you've created a pathogen of your own, you're going to learn about what to do about that pathogen, but it's not broadly applicable.
[01:48:53.902 --> 01:49:00.372]  And you can see, we had research on coronaviruses being done in the Wuhan Institute, being done in North Carolina.
[01:49:01.118 --> 01:49:02.560]  How much help did it give us?
[01:49:02.901 --> 01:49:05.685]  What did we learn from that research that protected us from COVID?
[01:49:05.725 --> 01:49:07.127]  And the answer is nothing.
[01:49:07.648 --> 01:49:07.968]  Nothing.
[01:49:08.068 --> 01:49:09.871]  Because it's inconceivable that you would.
[01:49:10.091 --> 01:49:14.037]  So they're using the excuse of public health to do this weapons research.
[01:49:14.077 --> 01:49:16.080]  But here's the punchline of the story.
[01:49:18.914 --> 01:49:33.498]  The vaccines are also the product of bioweapons research because they include the spike protein, which was the innovation that made the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 into an infectious human pathogen, right?
[01:49:34.158 --> 01:49:40.880]  The addition of a fern cleavage site to spike protein made this thing capable of infecting and spreading between humans.
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:46.341]  That spike protein was the core of the mRNA shots.
[01:49:47.745 --> 01:49:55.287]  Get two or more of those shots, now you create IgG4, and the more of the shots you have, the more you produce.
[01:49:56.687 --> 01:50:06.650]  Was there any literature that indicated that this was going to have this effect before they rolled out the vaccines, or was this just an unfortunate byproduct?
[01:50:07.410 --> 01:50:11.291]  I am not aware of that literature, but notice the following problem.
[01:50:13.581 --> 01:50:22.946]  That IgG4 signal to turn down the immune system is now connected to the presence of spike protein.
[01:50:24.627 --> 01:50:30.650]  At a bioengineering level, it is trivial to add spike protein to something else.
[01:50:32.951 --> 01:50:35.493]  Bioweapons researchers have a problem.
[01:50:36.704 --> 01:50:39.045]  If you create, first of all, they have two problems.
[01:50:39.145 --> 01:50:42.768]  One of them is there aren't that many weaponizable human pathogens, right?
[01:50:42.808 --> 01:50:49.692]  So they're sort of bored with the fact that they've got a small number of these things and they've played around with them and, you know, they're not happy.
[01:50:49.712 --> 01:50:50.832]  They need something else.
[01:50:51.493 --> 01:50:57.076]  So there's also a vast number in nature that you could in principle weaponize, but most of them can infect a human.
[01:50:57.196 --> 01:50:58.277]  So they engage in this.
[01:50:59.317 --> 01:51:10.185]  You know, hocus-pocus stuff where they take stuff that doesn't infect a human and they turn it into something that infects a human, and of course the risk that it will escape is very, very large, and the risk that we will learn anything useful is very, very small.
[01:51:11.046 --> 01:51:23.074]  But nonetheless, they play this game, and if they create something that is a frightening weapon that could in principle in their warped minds be used for something useful,
[01:51:24.830 --> 01:51:31.936]  The question is, how can you deliver a biological weapon that harms your enemies without harming your population?
[01:51:32.597 --> 01:51:35.199]  You have to separate those two populations in some way.
[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:40.724]  The obvious way to do it is to inoculate your population so that they have an immunity.
[01:51:41.565 --> 01:51:43.867]  The enemy population doesn't have an immunity, right?
[01:51:44.087 --> 01:51:49.352]  Mind you, this is all wildly immoral, but if you think like a weapons maker, this makes some kind of sense.
[01:51:49.913 --> 01:51:51.254]  But this is not the only way.
[01:51:52.765 --> 01:51:54.851]  That's where the ITG4 thing really throws me.
[01:51:55.773 --> 01:52:01.608]  Because what they seem to have, in the best case, accidentally done...
[01:52:02.541 --> 01:52:10.022]  is created a vulnerability in the populations that took the mRNA shots that does not exist in populations that didn't.
[01:52:10.782 --> 01:52:16.764]  And anytime a pathogen shows up with spike, it is likely to trigger the immune system to stand down.
[01:52:17.864 --> 01:52:18.084]  Right?
[01:52:19.024 --> 01:52:22.725]  That's something that a weapons maker might dream of doing to its enemy.
[01:52:24.505 --> 01:52:25.565]  Let me put it to you this way.
[01:52:26.245 --> 01:52:30.286]  He gave me in a two hour dinner plus two and a half hour dinner
[01:52:33.496 --> 01:52:35.378]  Let's take house with some other folks, I'll leave it at that.
[01:52:38.500 --> 01:53:02.860]  What he really thinks is going on, which I was already saying was going on, which is clear, he went into, no it's simple, China, Russia, others didn't take the mRNA shot, or the others, any of these, they don't have the spike protein, their immune system's not turned off, and now the entire Western world, the globalists want to get rid of, has been given the mRNA shots, and already have a stunned immune system way turned down,
[01:53:04.369 --> 01:53:23.246]  And now any enemy or our own government that is our enemy can produce any new virus at once and just dump just into the injection or they can weld it to the virus, that's a little bit harder but not hard, and hit us with that and it will probably kill you or almost kill you because now your body totally turns off when it sees a spike protein but it's already stunned.
[01:53:24.186 --> 01:53:28.090]  So the US, Canada, Western Europe, the UK, Australia,
[01:53:30.512 --> 01:53:48.840]  Singapore, New Zealand, a lot of folks in Mexico, Brazil, they take the mRNA, their immune system's turned way down, where regular stuff gets them sick or kills them, and now, they can, anybody can produce something else that has a spike protein, and it's probably gonna kill you.
[01:53:49.261 --> 01:53:57.805]  Now, Joe asks Brett Weinstein, well, do you know of any examples in nature or in life where they've given somebody vaccines that do this?
[01:53:57.825 --> 01:53:58.285]  He's like, well,
[01:53:59.451 --> 01:54:00.031]  Not in front of me.
[01:54:00.692 --> 01:54:01.532]  Well, guess what I do?
[01:54:01.552 --> 01:54:04.013]  Because I've interviewed hundreds of scientists, this is what I do.
[01:54:04.573 --> 01:54:05.433]  This is just one example.
[01:54:05.654 --> 01:54:06.894]  Marek's disease in chickens.
[01:54:06.914 --> 01:54:08.335]  They find it in poultry production.
[01:54:09.815 --> 01:54:28.203]  That's why they never created something for the common cold, that when you give them the equivalent for bird flu or cold, for coronaviruses, these vaccines, just normal ones, not mRNA, that after a few times, it lowers their immune system down to almost nothing, so you've got to keep giving them new vaccines for everything, and then finally, they just bloat up
[01:54:29.147 --> 01:54:33.328]  And have tumors all through them, and their joints swell up, and they get Marek's disease.
[01:54:35.629 --> 01:54:38.989]  So that's an example of this type of situation.
[01:54:39.029 --> 01:54:39.789]  You just mutate.
[01:54:39.809 --> 01:54:41.330]  You get cancer all over you.
[01:54:42.630 --> 01:54:43.610]  And you die a horrible death.
[01:54:46.311 --> 01:54:48.351]  So, this is a fact.
[01:54:48.591 --> 01:54:54.853]  So, this is live, but I think we should take this part where I just describe the end and what Brett Weinstein told me, and what I already know is true.
[01:54:56.445 --> 01:55:02.187]  And put it on the front, because we need to tell them the big takeaway, because people watch this and it's so academic, they're like, what are we hearing?
[01:55:02.487 --> 01:55:03.648]  He's being very careful there.
[01:55:05.048 --> 01:55:08.129]  And he said he was going to go on air and explain all this the way he did, so I don't think it's off record.
[01:55:11.111 --> 01:55:17.173]  So, that's the issue, is that China and Russia and these other countries didn't take it.
[01:55:18.734 --> 01:55:24.716]  Something like 70% of our population took one shot, 55% took two shots, you can look the numbers up, vary per country, but it's...
[01:55:25.796 --> 01:55:27.958]  Something like 37% took 4 or more shots.
[01:55:27.978 --> 01:55:31.481]  10% took 5 or more shots.
[01:55:31.501 --> 01:55:34.063]  4% have taken 6 or 7 shots.
[01:55:34.323 --> 01:55:35.704]  1% has taken 10 shots.
[01:55:36.064 --> 01:55:36.465]  Look it up!
[01:55:38.286 --> 01:55:40.548]  1% of our population, I saw it in the news last week, have taken 10.
[01:55:43.530 --> 01:55:44.932]  Works so good, you need 10 of them.
[01:55:46.453 --> 01:55:47.994]  And their immune system's totally gone.
[01:55:48.414 --> 01:55:53.799]  They're manufacturing spike protein that's super toxic in your body and causes cancer and infertility and strokes and heart attacks.
[01:55:56.693 --> 01:55:57.554]  I mean, wow!
[01:55:58.495 --> 01:56:00.196]  This is a big deal.
[01:56:03.779 --> 01:56:05.300]  So we're gonna get him on the show soon.
[01:56:06.021 --> 01:56:06.481]  Go through it.
[01:56:06.501 --> 01:56:09.344]  I'm gonna get other experts and scientists on, but everybody needs to send this.
[01:56:10.104 --> 01:56:13.307]  All the scientists, all the urologists, all the researchers, this is hiding in plain view.
[01:56:13.747 --> 01:56:14.628]  This is what they did.
[01:56:16.129 --> 01:56:17.531]  Now the media focused on this.
[01:56:18.952 --> 01:56:23.716]  Rogan rips mainstream media for calling to cover real numbers of people injured or killed by COVID shots.
[01:56:25.984 --> 01:56:27.705]  He also talks about the childhood numbers.
[01:56:28.205 --> 01:56:29.446]  Those clips are all important.
[01:56:29.586 --> 01:56:31.648]  I'll get to those at another show.
[01:56:32.808 --> 01:56:37.912]  But I don't have ways to describe to you how hardcore serious this is.
[01:56:38.332 --> 01:56:39.312]  You can see it for yourself.
[01:56:39.372 --> 01:56:41.094]  It's up to you what you're gonna do with this information now.
[01:56:41.794 --> 01:56:50.800]  Because by exposing the globalists and people having knowledge of this, they may not now release some new pathogen with a spike protein on it that'll go from making you sick to killing you.
[01:56:51.789 --> 01:56:53.830]  So we're gonna just sit here and take this when we can see what they did?
[01:56:53.870 --> 01:57:06.395]  They didn't accidentally do all this with the Pentagon and Bill Gates for decades and Obama and all these big tech companies funding it to set this up and a cover story that it leaked out of a lab and now we gotta give you this shot to take care of you that does the opposite and erases your immune system.
[01:57:08.075 --> 01:57:14.558]  This is a diabolical binary weapon program hidden in plain view, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:16.650 --> 01:57:17.290]  I'm out of time.
[01:57:17.710 --> 01:57:18.490]  We're live right now.
[01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:19.370]  It's about to be archived.
[01:57:19.390 --> 01:57:24.391]  It'll restream at Infowars.com forward slash show and on X. Share it like your life depends on it.
[01:57:24.591 --> 01:57:26.232]  The live feed at Real Alex Jones right now.
[01:57:26.252 --> 01:57:27.812]  Your email list, your text message list, everything.
[01:57:28.892 --> 01:57:31.693]  Of course it came out the transgender shooter was transgender.
[01:57:32.033 --> 01:57:32.993]  They tried to cover that up.
[01:57:33.113 --> 01:57:34.393]  Even CNN's reporting on it.
[01:57:35.393 --> 01:57:37.113]  They tried to cover up the last seven shooters.
[01:57:37.133 --> 01:57:38.274]  This is eight shooters in a row.
[01:57:39.434 --> 01:57:41.794]  It's buried right here in the CNN article.
[01:57:44.695 --> 01:57:45.775]  I've got that information.
[01:57:47.813 --> 01:57:52.516]  Buried on the last page that they were being mean to transgender and mean to him because he was transgender and all the rest of it?
[01:57:58.239 --> 01:57:58.840]  It's incredible.
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:00.601]  They are producing these people.
[01:58:00.641 --> 01:58:02.061]  They are on SSRIs.
[01:58:02.081 --> 01:58:03.062]  They're hopped out of their mind.
[01:58:03.682 --> 01:58:04.203]  It's insane.
[01:58:04.223 --> 01:58:08.225]  And meanwhile, Diversity Nutritionist says, unprocessed whole foods are racist.
[01:58:08.265 --> 01:58:09.926]  Yeah, eat GMO or you're racist.
[01:58:10.406 --> 01:58:12.548]  I mean, come on people, see through this for yourselves.
[01:58:13.291 --> 01:58:14.052]  It's up to you now.
[01:58:14.752 --> 01:58:15.693]  The live feed's going out.
[01:58:15.753 --> 01:58:16.074]  Share it.
[01:58:16.094 --> 01:58:18.096]  We'll have archives of it soon.
[01:58:18.476 --> 01:58:18.876]  Share it.
[01:58:18.936 --> 01:58:19.217]  Share it.
[01:58:19.257 --> 01:58:20.017]  Take clips out of it.
[01:58:20.077 --> 01:58:21.239]  You are the Paul Reveres.
[01:58:21.759 --> 01:58:24.962]  And whatever you do, boost your immune system with vitamin C. Boost your immune system.
[01:58:24.982 --> 01:58:27.645]  Clean out your cardiovascular system with Nitric Boost.
[01:58:28.866 --> 01:58:29.546]  Pray to God.
[01:58:29.706 --> 01:58:30.307]  Get healthy.
[01:58:30.347 --> 01:58:31.128]  Drink more water.
[01:58:31.688 --> 01:58:36.273]  Exercise, because the New World Order's got us geared up for the next big attack, and you can see it as
[01:58:38.271 --> 01:58:40.133]  Clearly is the nose on my face or your face.
[01:58:40.333 --> 01:58:42.115]  And please support the broadcast.
[01:58:42.215 --> 01:58:45.418]  Infowarsstore.com, drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:58:45.438 --> 01:58:47.039]  Incredible supplements, incredible products.
[01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:48.541]  That's how we fund the operation.
[01:58:48.601 --> 01:58:49.642]  Books, films, t-shirts.
[01:58:50.002 --> 01:58:58.110]  Infowarsstore.com, our other great sponsor with incredible nanotech, silver products, toothpaste, immune boosters, everything at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:58:59.909 --> 01:59:01.970]  And then Lord willing, they're trying to shut us down as we speak.
[01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:02.670]  It's ongoing.
[01:59:02.690 --> 01:59:04.871]  I'll be back tomorrow night, 4 p.m.
[01:59:04.911 --> 01:59:06.411]  Central, for the Sunday show.
[01:59:06.511 --> 01:59:09.552]  They wouldn't be trying to shut us down if we weren't having an effect.
[01:59:10.352 --> 01:59:13.813]  The propaganda wouldn't be necessary if the situation was hopeless, as has been said.
[01:59:14.293 --> 01:59:15.714]  Internet's saying no one knows who first said it.
[01:59:16.134 --> 01:59:17.014]  Great job to the crew.
[01:59:17.254 --> 01:59:18.474]  Great job to Chase Geyser.
[01:59:18.494 --> 01:59:20.095]  Great job to Professor.
[01:59:21.772 --> 01:59:22.513]  Weinstein, great job.
[01:59:22.533 --> 01:59:23.513]  Joe Rogan, great job, everybody.
[01:59:23.533 --> 01:59:24.974]  Now, the ball is in your court.
[01:59:25.014 --> 01:59:25.895]  We know what they did.
[01:59:26.596 --> 01:59:27.516]  It's hiding in plain view.
[01:59:27.536 --> 01:59:29.898]  They've been caught red-handed, bare minimum of racism in their immune system.
[01:59:29.918 --> 01:59:31.819]  They knew that, and they're still recommending it.
[01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:32.780]  This is evil.
[01:59:33.761 --> 01:59:36.603]  Now, it's up to you to get this out there like your life depends on it.
[01:59:40.327 --> 01:59:50.175]  I talk a lot about the high quality supplements at InfoWarsStore.com and the great things they'll do for your health, your vitality, your stamina, your libido, your focus, your clarity.
[01:59:50.895 --> 01:59:54.758]  And I tend to talk about our best selling products from InfoWars MD.
[01:59:55.138 --> 02:00:00.963]  The Nitric Boost, the Tumor 95, the amazing CBD gummies and 1000 milligram tincture.
[02:00:00.983 --> 02:00:03.044]  It's about as strong as it gets, highest quality.
[02:00:03.265 --> 02:00:07.008]  But these other products are excellent as well and they're getting rave reviews.
[02:00:07.048 --> 02:00:09.930]  Let's talk about some of these other great products from InfoWars MD.
[02:00:12.051 --> 02:00:16.952]  Superfood greens just a super high quality equivalent to some of the best sellers that are out there.
[02:00:16.972 --> 02:00:18.833]  It's got a whole bunch of superfoods in it.
[02:00:18.853 --> 02:00:27.356]  You get everything you need in one big dose with all the key cofactors and things that a basic vitamin mineral type system may not have in it.
[02:00:27.736 --> 02:00:28.737]  It is a superfood.
[02:00:29.297 --> 02:00:38.220]  We also of course have good night's sleep just a good high quality natural herbal sleep system that gives you deep sleep that's so good for your immune system.
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:44.361]  But of course, nerve renew helps your nerves be healthy and helps a lot with pain.
[02:00:44.701 --> 02:00:46.342]  People really, really love nerve review.
[02:00:46.362 --> 02:00:49.182]  And we've got probiotic formula, an excellent probiotic.
[02:00:49.482 --> 02:00:56.244]  That's so critical to your health because just the chlorine in tap water, if you're drinking that or showering in it, you know, kills the natural flora in your gut.
[02:00:56.604 --> 02:01:02.465]  Better mood really, you know, gives you a clean, focused mindset, does amazing things.
[02:01:02.925 --> 02:01:07.006]  And then, of course, I'm really excited about Ashwagandha with black pepper.
[02:01:07.526 --> 02:01:09.086]  This is an adaptogen.
[02:01:09.266 --> 02:01:09.906]  Ashwagandha.
[02:01:10.207 --> 02:01:15.688]  Your brain, your heart, your mental clarity, your mood, your immune system.
[02:01:15.708 --> 02:01:16.688]  It just basically does everything.
[02:01:17.028 --> 02:01:18.308]  Ashwagandha is simply incredible.
