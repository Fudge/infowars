[00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:16.953]  Gentlemen, it is February 29th, 2024.
[00:00:17.053 --> 00:00:18.134]  We are in the middle of the leap year day.
[00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:23.127]  Alex Jones here.
[00:00:23.668 --> 00:00:28.790]  I have got some family issues I have to attend to for part of the broadcast today, but I should be in later.
[00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.492]  We've got one hell of a transmission lined up for you with our intrepid crew and the great Owen Schroer.
[00:00:34.572 --> 00:00:39.554]  But I wanted to come to you with the grave news of Letitia James.
[00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:51.399]  Now remember, Letitia James is literally installed by George Soros, brags about it, pledged to bring down Donald Trump if she was elected as the New York Attorney General.
[00:00:52.406 --> 00:01:22.044]   Well, fresh off of her rigged court case with no jury, where the judge found Trump guilty of real estate fraud, but there was no victim, and all the other things she's doing, trying to shut down the NRA and against so many other attacks, now she's announced she's going after the biggest meatpacking company in the United States for climate change, and quote, lying to the public, saying that Cow farts are not bad.
[00:01:22.184 --> 00:01:39.669]  Yes, in America, in the year 2024, weaponized legal system is going after the largest, or the top three, you can argue it's the largest, arguably the largest meat packing company in the United States.
[00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.850]  We'll get to the details of that coming up.
[00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:47.812]  But understand, ladies and gentlemen, everything she does is a beta test.
[00:01:48.072 --> 00:02:16.197]   What you see in New York, what you see in California, Our globalist beta tests and the UN said 20 years ago they couldn't get the federal government to pass all these carbon tax power grabs that literally takes over every facet of our lives and every industry that they were going to go to the states, the counties and the city and use something called munialization where they get all of the locales merged into basically UN treaties and they fly
[00:02:17.315 --> 00:02:21.638]  The leadership of the government around all these fancy junkets and vacations.
[00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:29.084]  But more importantly, these international groups funded by the UN NGOs fund who they run for office.
[00:02:29.104 --> 00:02:31.526]  So we talk about Soros all day because everybody knows who he is.
[00:02:32.126 --> 00:02:36.630]  He's just one of the biggest NGO systems with his open society operation.
[00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.531]  We're talking about one of thousands.
[00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:40.393]  He's not even one of the largest.
[00:02:40.413 --> 00:02:41.493]  He's in the top 10.
[00:02:42.174 --> 00:02:48.645]   But when they come out and go after beef, Or they promise you will eat the bugs.
[00:02:49.985 --> 00:03:01.910]  If they can take down one of the largest meat packers in the United States, that also does business around the world, they will be able to take down anybody they want.
[00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.791]  So this is serious criminal racketeering.
[00:03:05.911 --> 00:03:09.713]  And almost all the federal courts have been taken over by the Soros operatives.
[00:03:09.753 --> 00:03:11.714]  The Supreme Court is barely hanging on.
[00:03:11.814 --> 00:03:12.774]  It's being intimidated.
[00:03:12.794 --> 00:03:14.535]  It's being attacked.
[00:03:15.566 --> 00:03:16.927]  And this is such a great situation.
[00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:20.230]  They don't just have almost every major city district attorney.
[00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.552]  They don't just have most of the county attorneys in any populous area.
[00:03:24.153 --> 00:03:26.895]  They don't just have 20 plus attorney generals.
[00:03:27.475 --> 00:03:29.217]  They don't just have most of the federal judges.
[00:03:30.538 --> 00:03:33.200]  They are literally putting policy in at the colleges.
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.782]  They are coming in and now targeting rice.
[00:03:37.983 --> 00:03:39.224]  I covered this two years ago.
[00:03:39.324 --> 00:03:50.003]   I said, next to UN after beef, which is one of the biggest things feeding people worldwide, And holding up the economy, and especially small ranches and farms, is rice.
[00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:53.725]  Rice is half the diet of about half the world.
[00:03:54.406 --> 00:03:56.768]  So you cut that out, well guess what?
[00:03:57.188 --> 00:03:58.489]  They grow it in swamps.
[00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.231]  Artificial rice paddies.
[00:04:02.211 --> 00:04:14.314]   So now they're coming out and saying officially they're going to put taxes and regulations on it because what comes out of swamp water Why, when you drive over a swamp on a highway, does it smell like a cow fart?
[00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:16.175]  It's methane, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:16.616 --> 00:04:18.037]  Methane helps form our atmosphere.
[00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:18.557]  It's what helps.
[00:04:19.197 --> 00:04:22.279]  Ultraviolet radiation coming in gets held to the planet's surface.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.162]  That global warming's good, or we would be all freezing to death.
[00:04:26.462 --> 00:04:27.763]  And so there's always been swamps.
[00:04:27.783 --> 00:04:30.045]  There's always been bovine, at least for millions of years.
[00:04:30.805 --> 00:04:32.346]  You know, buffalo, water buffalo.
[00:04:32.827 --> 00:04:36.529]  There's, there's, there's, there's, the cows are basically on almost every continent.
[00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.351]  And we have, obviously, our domesticated ones.
[00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:40.632]  They're not bad folks.
[00:04:41.428 --> 00:04:43.189]  Remember, we're the carbon they want to cut.
[00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:53.456]  We're the carbon they're targeting, and we're going along with this absurdity, and now Letitia James is coming directly after one of the key industries in America with her red courts, and I'm sure she'll win.
[00:04:53.476 --> 00:04:55.218]  So, what are we going to do about it?
[00:04:55.238 --> 00:04:56.098]  We'll talk about it when we return.
[00:04:56.478 --> 00:04:58.480]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:59.662 --> 00:05:05.305]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen to this live February 29th 2024 transmission.
[00:05:05.465 --> 00:05:06.745]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:05:07.345 --> 00:05:12.088]  So there's a lot of massive news information breaking today on so many fronts we're about to go over it all.
[00:05:12.908 --> 00:05:19.351]  But first I want to talk about JBS, one of the largest meatpacking companies in the world, particularly packing beef.
[00:05:20.191 --> 00:05:25.095]   They've been sued by the Soros Front creature, Leticia James.
[00:05:25.735 --> 00:05:28.657]  And folks have to understand, this is not just some New York nuttiness.
[00:05:29.117 --> 00:05:33.839]  This is part of a strategic plan worldwide to demonize and criminalize beef first.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.320]  Then they can move on to every other major staple.
[00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:39.662]  They're now targeting rice next.
[00:05:39.882 --> 00:05:40.542]  Worldwide.
[00:05:40.642 --> 00:05:41.443]  Seen in headlines.
[00:05:41.563 --> 00:05:43.604]  Moves to restrict or ban rice.
[00:05:44.024 --> 00:05:45.224]  Or put carbon taxes on it.
[00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:47.886]  This is literally waging war.
[00:05:49.497 --> 00:05:52.376]  on the very food supply that humanity needs to live.
[00:05:52.376 --> 00:05:53.977]  This is the post-industrial world.
[00:05:53.977 --> 00:05:56.497]  This is the depopulation operation.
[00:05:56.497 --> 00:06:02.776]   So people make fun of New York and California or France or other areas totally run by the globalists.
[00:06:02.776 --> 00:06:04.977]  And they say, those people are idiots.
[00:06:04.977 --> 00:06:06.817]  Ha ha ha, we'll just move out of that area.
[00:06:06.817 --> 00:06:12.896]   Well, the very same BlackRock controlled central banks or central banks that control BlackRock,
[00:06:12.896 --> 00:06:18.456]   I should say as their front group, have a strategic plan to take over all the major cities
[00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:21.057]  in the world and then expand out from there.
[00:06:21.057 --> 00:06:24.936]   So the plight of people in New York is the plight of people in rural Texas.
[00:06:24.936 --> 00:06:29.855]   The plight of people in Toronto is the plight of people in rural Wyoming.
[00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:34.817]   The plight of folks in Australia being enslaved will be our plight in Louisiana or Florida.
[00:06:34.817 --> 00:06:37.157]  This is a global enemy we face.
[00:06:37.157 --> 00:06:41.417]   That's how I always know what they're gonna do next, because they have battle plans.
[00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:46.377]   And I'd make documentaries and show you their documents, show you their statements 20 years ago, 25 years ago,
[00:06:46.377 --> 00:06:51.176]   and people couldn't believe it because it was so fantastical to say
[00:06:51.176 --> 00:06:54.656]   they're gonna try to target the nuclear family, they're gonna try to sterilize children,
[00:06:54.656 --> 00:07:01.516]   they're gonna try to restrict and then ban beef or major staples like rice, but it was all planned then.
[00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:06.820]  If you watch the Obama deception, or if you watch my film Endgame, people watch those films.
[00:07:07.771 --> 00:07:12.932]  Endgame made in 2007, and they just freak out, and they go, how the hell did he have a crystal ball?
[00:07:13.092 --> 00:07:13.672]  I didn't!
[00:07:13.812 --> 00:07:16.132]  I'm showing the documents!
[00:07:16.172 --> 00:07:28.015]  So, Kevin O'Leary and others have made the great point that everybody's leaving New York, and that Leticia James is waging war on the corporations and businesses that aren't fully Globalist-controlled, and that people will just leave.
[00:07:28.275 --> 00:07:33.575]  Well, they're designed to leave, and then the Globalists will just target the next sector, the next area they take over.
[00:07:33.996 --> 00:07:40.358]   There is an absolute method to this entire plan that is being rolled out.
[00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.379]  And so don't underestimate how dangerous these people are.
[00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:44.660]  But I don't think they're all powerful.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:58.406]  If we know their larger plans, if we understand how cold-blooded they are, if we understand how criminal they are, and if we then organize and oppose them, what they're promoting is absolute total tyranny and can easily be defeated.
[00:07:58.866 --> 00:08:03.589]   As I've said, we're selling Ice water in the Sahara Desert.
[00:08:03.789 --> 00:08:04.510]  Everybody wants it.
[00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:05.291]  Freedom's sexy.
[00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:05.891]  Freedom works.
[00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:06.652]  Freedom's amazing.
[00:08:08.534 --> 00:08:12.839]  They're selling sand in the Sahara Desert to people that are dying of thirst, okay?
[00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:15.541]  But you've got to admit they're globalists.
[00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:17.343]  You've got to admit they're the New World Order.
[00:08:17.403 --> 00:08:18.905]  You've got to admit they're coming down on us.
[00:08:18.925 --> 00:08:20.527]  And I know this audience is hardcore.
[00:08:21.294 --> 00:08:35.404]  That's why they want to shut the show down, is because they're scared of this assemblage of people, this assemblage of folks that know what's going on, that could be the genesis point, which it's now officially been, to spread the truth all over the country and all over the world.
[00:08:35.764 --> 00:08:38.686]  So they failed in shutting down our genesis operation.
[00:08:39.206 --> 00:08:43.649]  And the first big network I was on, and still am on, is Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:08:45.290 --> 00:09:09.113]  involved early on in the debate about what to name it because they were already putting out syndicated shows, financing some shows, a gold company was, and instead of just syndicating individual shows they wanted to have a network and Ted Anderson had the idea for Genesis and the general manager had another name that I don't think was as good it was still a good name and I said no Ted I agree with you Genesis because this is the beginning of something much larger.
[00:09:10.294 --> 00:09:12.335]  And they wanted to take over radio.
[00:09:12.375 --> 00:09:13.896]  They wanted to later launch a TV network.
[00:09:13.916 --> 00:09:14.716]  That never happened.
[00:09:14.736 --> 00:09:20.859]  But the point was, I mean, I guess I kind of did, but the point is, is that this is the Genesis.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.461]  And we've successfully initiated the detonation.
[00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:29.384]  Okay, but don't think of it as a detonation of death, a detonation of awakening in life, like the cap.
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:37.664]  In the back of a cartridge that detonates the larger powder charge and then shoots the bullet down the barrel.
[00:09:38.264 --> 00:09:41.746]  We have detonated it and now it's been aimed and it's now hit the globulus.
[00:09:41.787 --> 00:09:47.250]  So we're deep into the fight right now, but you have to understand she's not just a clown.
[00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.752]  She's a front person that will do what she's told.
[00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:57.648]  And these people are very, very strategic and they've got to be recognized for the organized criminals they are.
[00:09:58.168 --> 00:10:12.661]   If I hear one more Republican or one more conservative or one more populist sit there and tell me That, oh, these are environmentalist wackos, these are loony tune nuts, oh, look at this crazy plan they got.
[00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:13.802]  These people don't know what they're doing.
[00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.523]  No, they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:10:15.983 --> 00:10:18.785]  And the biggest banks, the biggest corporations came up with this.
[00:10:18.845 --> 00:10:24.770]  In the mid-1980s, Enron, look it up, came up with the carbon tax scam and how to tax and control everything.
[00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.512]  And the oil companies have been in on it from day one.
[00:10:27.552 --> 00:10:30.034]  They're the ones making money on both sides.
[00:10:30.834 --> 00:10:32.115]  So that is the reality.
[00:10:32.175 --> 00:10:33.096]  This is a big, big deal.
[00:10:33.376 --> 00:10:35.637]  Owen Schroer takes over now with so much information.
[00:10:35.657 --> 00:10:36.878]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:10:37.439 --> 00:10:38.539]  God bless and good luck.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.621]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:10:41.702 --> 00:10:55.071]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, we're with you here with all kinds of important breaking information in honor of privilege, a duty, quite frankly, to be here with you on this Thursday, February 29th, 2024.
[00:10:55.111 --> 00:11:04.928]   Let me Give you a snapshot of what we have coming up for the rest of today's transmission.
[00:11:05.849 --> 00:11:09.250]  Of course, we may be hearing from Alex again throughout the transmission.
[00:11:10.731 --> 00:11:14.012]  But I have a loaded broadcast for you today.
[00:11:14.952 --> 00:11:26.017]  So loaded that I'm going to need to be here for the entire four hours of this Alex Jones Show transmission.
[00:11:27.915 --> 00:11:32.178]  We have Joe Biden, a lot of political news revolving around Joe Biden.
[00:11:33.539 --> 00:11:35.801]  You have Joe Biden making a statement.
[00:11:39.244 --> 00:11:42.566]  I can't even get into it without having to pause.
[00:11:43.807 --> 00:11:45.969]  And it just shakes me to the core.
[00:11:45.989 --> 00:11:49.011]  I mean, this should be sending chills down your spine.
[00:11:49.472 --> 00:11:53.475]  Joe Biden goes out and says they're going to ban assault weapons.
[00:11:53.655 --> 00:11:54.576]  I mean, it's a short clip.
[00:11:56.097 --> 00:11:57.138]  So I might as well just go to it.
[00:11:59.182 --> 00:12:04.244]  Here's Joe Biden and the Democrat Party telling you the Second Amendment means nothing to them.
[00:12:04.504 --> 00:12:05.844]  They wipe their ass with it.
[00:12:06.164 --> 00:12:12.427]  They want to disarm you just like every other authoritarian, murderous dictator in world history.
[00:12:14.887 --> 00:12:20.109]  We're going to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines next time around because it has to be done.
[00:12:20.129 --> 00:12:21.730]  We're going to finish the job.
[00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:27.432]  We're going to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines next time around because it has to be done.
[00:12:28.092 --> 00:12:28.472]  There you go.
[00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:33.118]  They're gonna finish the job of disarming the American people.
[00:12:33.138 --> 00:12:37.522]  They're gonna finish the job of disarming the law-abiding American citizen.
[00:12:37.702 --> 00:12:41.745]  They're gonna finish the job of turning this into an authoritarian dictatorship.
[00:12:43.046 --> 00:12:47.110]  They're gonna finish the job of destroying America.
[00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.573]  They're gonna finish the job of ending your Bill of Rights.
[00:12:51.973 --> 00:12:52.954]  But see, there's a problem.
[00:12:55.476 --> 00:12:56.137]  There's a problem.
[00:12:58.168 --> 00:12:59.930]  This is what the Democrats don't want you to know.
[00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.551]  This is what the liberals don't want you to know.
[00:13:02.953 --> 00:13:06.617]  Your rights are not given to you by the government.
[00:13:09.199 --> 00:13:12.262]  Your rights are not given to you by Joe Biden.
[00:13:14.945 --> 00:13:17.468]  Your rights are not even given to you by a piece of paper, actually.
[00:13:17.568 --> 00:13:18.129]  The Bill of Rights.
[00:13:19.201 --> 00:13:22.062]  Your rights are given to you by God.
[00:13:22.582 --> 00:13:25.222]  Your rights are given to you by the Creator.
[00:13:25.662 --> 00:13:27.343]  This is just recognized in the Bill of Rights.
[00:13:27.563 --> 00:13:29.703]  This is just recognized in our founding documents.
[00:13:31.204 --> 00:13:31.944]  Why is that important?
[00:13:31.984 --> 00:13:38.205]  Because if your rights are given to you by God, if your rights are given to you by your Creator, well then they can't be taken away by the government.
[00:13:39.966 --> 00:13:40.066]  Ah.
[00:13:41.646 --> 00:13:46.227]  And now you see why the American left, and now you see why the Democrat Party hates God so much.
[00:13:49.505 --> 00:13:53.292]  And wants to convince you that you evolved from a monkey turd.
[00:13:53.312 --> 00:13:55.676]  Of course you didn't.
[00:13:55.736 --> 00:13:56.858]  You were created by God.
[00:13:58.061 --> 00:13:58.622]  In his image.
[00:14:00.678 --> 00:14:11.767]  Our rights, given to us and endowed by our Creator, signed, sealed, and delivered with the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and our Bill of Rights.
[00:14:12.207 --> 00:14:20.453]  And Joe Biden goes up in front of the American people and says, we're going to finish the job and take away and end your Second Amendment right.
[00:14:20.734 --> 00:14:26.118]  But if they can do that, they can take your First Amendment right, they can take your Fourth Amendment right, your Fifth Amendment right, your Eighth Amendment right.
[00:14:27.168 --> 00:14:33.213]  Your entire Bill of Rights, your entire Constitution, your entire Declaration of Independence.
[00:14:34.214 --> 00:14:36.236]  But I'm already losing track.
[00:14:36.736 --> 00:14:37.577]  We'll come back to that.
[00:14:38.137 --> 00:14:40.859]  But again, that should just send chills up your spine.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:51.848]  And that's why Ezra Levant is going to be joining us in the second hour to talk about how Trudeau has turned into an authoritarian dictate, and it's sending chills up his spine.
[00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:54.731]  And so he wants to tell you about that.
[00:14:56.783 --> 00:15:07.329]  But it's just like, you're paying for the fight for democracy in Ukraine, and then Zelensky has cancelled two rounds of elections in a row.
[00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:08.370]  Huh.
[00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.510]  Yeah.
[00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:11.091]  Yeah.
[00:15:12.592 --> 00:15:16.374]  Oh, the Democrats are protecting democracy.
[00:15:16.855 --> 00:15:17.115]  Really?
[00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:25.829]  You've got all these judges, all these prosecuting attorneys, politically going after Donald Trump.
[00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.912]  By the way, nine in ten of them are black.
[00:15:30.693 --> 00:15:33.015]  And I don't say that to be a part of the racial divide.
[00:15:34.056 --> 00:15:42.583]  The reason why this is significant is because this is exactly what the leftist agenda has been with the racial divide and with affirmative action.
[00:15:43.404 --> 00:15:44.365]  Because people keep noticing.
[00:15:44.425 --> 00:15:51.151]  It's like, why are the majority of these judges and prosecuting attorneys going after Trump black women?
[00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:53.293]  Because that was the design.
[00:15:53.614 --> 00:15:54.595]  That was the propaganda.
[00:15:55.496 --> 00:15:58.679]  Get black women specifically to hate white people.
[00:16:01.007 --> 00:16:19.803]  And then get them into positions of power with affirmative action, and then they justify their racism, they justify their bigotry, they justify their politically motivated persecution, with, oh, I'm black, and he's a white man, so it's okay.
[00:16:20.523 --> 00:16:21.544]  And they don't even hide this!
[00:16:21.804 --> 00:16:25.607]  This isn't me up here reporting this, like, oh my gosh, I've discovered this secret thing.
[00:16:25.968 --> 00:16:27.209]  They brag about it!
[00:16:29.437 --> 00:16:34.943]  Like Tiffany Henyard in Illinois, she comes out and she says, I'm a black woman!
[00:16:35.183 --> 00:16:36.444]  You can't attack me!
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:38.840]  So that's what they've done.
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:56.508]  They've made this caste system, this racial caste system, and they tell black women, you're at the top of it, so you can go be a judge, you can go be a mayor, you can go be a prosecuting district attorney, and you can do whatever you want, and you can persecute the white man, and you're above it all.
[00:16:56.588 --> 00:16:58.089]  You're beyond reproach.
[00:16:58.389 --> 00:17:02.070]  And then they say that during press conferences, during hearings.
[00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:05.432]  It's all part of design.
[00:17:08.769 --> 00:17:09.550]  So we got news on that.
[00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:13.293]  And then Biden keeps lying to the American people.
[00:17:13.973 --> 00:17:15.695]  They won't give him a cognitive test.
[00:17:15.755 --> 00:17:16.355]  We know why.
[00:17:19.638 --> 00:17:20.178]  Oh, gee.
[00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:23.161]  Why won't Joe Biden take a cognition test?
[00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:24.121]  I don't know.
[00:17:24.361 --> 00:17:32.088]  You know, I just... And then he comes out and he says the doctors say that I'm way too healthy for somebody that's 81.
[00:17:32.648 --> 00:17:33.369]  Well, I don't know.
[00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.011]  Maybe in some degrees that's true.
[00:17:39.087 --> 00:17:41.648]  But see, nobody's buying it.
[00:17:42.988 --> 00:17:44.048]  Nobody's buying it anyway.
[00:17:46.069 --> 00:17:48.649]  And the proof is in the pudding.
[00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.191]  Not only does nobody buy it, nobody is really even interested in it.
[00:17:56.211 --> 00:17:58.132]  Nobody's even interested in it.
[00:17:59.152 --> 00:18:02.313]  Joe Biden goes on late night talk shows and nobody watches.
[00:18:05.834 --> 00:18:14.442]   It's well known It's well known, Donald Trump interviews are the biggest thing for your ratings.
[00:18:15.323 --> 00:18:18.425]  Every time, Donald Trump interview, big ratings boost.
[00:18:18.545 --> 00:18:19.926]  Joe Biden interview, nothing.
[00:18:20.426 --> 00:18:21.167]  No boost at all.
[00:18:21.487 --> 00:18:22.027]  No interest.
[00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:23.388]  Most people actually tune out.
[00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:30.954]  And I realized something else in this phenomenon as well.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:42.188]  In a strange way, social media is actually the only thing keeping the old guard mainstream media alive.
[00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:44.450]  What am I talking about?
[00:18:46.252 --> 00:19:07.240]   Most views or ratings or interest, maybe ratings isn't the right word, but it does count, All the interest and views now from mainstream media are actually coming from clips on social media.
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:14.723]  So when Joe Biden goes and does an interview on late night TV, nobody tunes in.
[00:19:15.263 --> 00:19:16.103]  Nobody watches it.
[00:19:16.483 --> 00:19:17.064]  Nobody knows.
[00:19:17.124 --> 00:19:17.724]  Nobody cares.
[00:19:18.184 --> 00:19:23.526]  The only reason anybody sees it is clips on social media.
[00:19:24.087 --> 00:19:24.467]  That's it.
[00:19:26.072 --> 00:19:32.776]  The same goes for The View, the same goes for Jon Stewart, the same goes for most cable shows.
[00:19:32.836 --> 00:19:42.822]  When Joy Reid goes on racial, deranged diatribes on her show, nobody watches, but people pull the clips and put them on social media and they say, whoa, look at this crazy woman on TV!
[00:19:45.343 --> 00:19:50.246]  I don't know if the answer is to stop doing that, because it's still newsworthy and people want to see it.
[00:19:51.874 --> 00:19:57.497]  But it's social media that's actually keeping the dinosaur media relevant at this point.
[00:20:01.058 --> 00:20:04.780]  That's why Tucker Carlson can leave Fox News and then be bigger than ever.
[00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:06.801]  On social media.
[00:20:09.562 --> 00:20:15.505]  On X. Which is now essentially the political town square.
[00:20:18.268 --> 00:20:19.210]  We've got more news.
[00:20:19.852 --> 00:20:24.101]  You know, this is really... I could pull a thousand stories about this.
[00:20:27.378 --> 00:20:33.542]  Like, American Heart Association was paid off to say heart disease was caused by saturated fat, not seed oils.
[00:20:33.922 --> 00:20:39.505]  Well, yeah, that's because they put the seed oils in everything because it's cheaper, but it's extremely unhealthy.
[00:20:39.545 --> 00:20:40.426]  They don't want you to know about it.
[00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:45.168]  All to processed food linked to 32 harmful effects to health.
[00:20:45.568 --> 00:20:48.150]  I mean, we could talk about the microplastics and everything.
[00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.291]  We could talk about... I mean, I can go on and on and on.
[00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:59.969]   And for me, This was one of the biggest game changers in my life.
[00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:07.374]  When you realize, when you realize that, I guess you would call it, what would you call it?
[00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:08.474]  Mainstream food?
[00:21:08.554 --> 00:21:09.375]  Corporate food?
[00:21:12.777 --> 00:21:13.838]  Is mostly poison.
[00:21:15.619 --> 00:21:16.419]  Mostly poison.
[00:21:19.261 --> 00:21:31.121]   And it was tuning into this broadcast and 2013 and 14 with the guests that came on the show.
[00:21:34.563 --> 00:21:40.807]  And I remember, I mean, you had Mike Adams, you had Bonnie Hari, the food babe, who's still banned on X, by the way.
[00:21:40.927 --> 00:21:42.608]  Why won't they release the food babe on X?
[00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:45.350]  And other guests like that.
[00:21:46.851 --> 00:21:52.655]  Because you don't really think, you don't really think, well, gee, I go to the grocery store and most of the things I buy are poison.
[00:21:54.062 --> 00:21:57.884]  Until somebody explains it and then it all clicks.
[00:21:58.685 --> 00:22:01.186]  Like, yeah, wait a second, why aren't I reading the ingredients?
[00:22:01.226 --> 00:22:02.087]  What are these ingredients?
[00:22:02.187 --> 00:22:03.808]  I can't even pronounce half this crap.
[00:22:06.389 --> 00:22:08.370]  And then you realize, yeah, it's all poison.
[00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:11.912]  And the FDA, the US government, they're not there to protect you.
[00:22:13.573 --> 00:22:14.394]  They're bought off.
[00:22:15.755 --> 00:22:17.215]  They're part of the eugenics program.
[00:22:20.297 --> 00:22:21.378]  So we got news on that.
[00:22:24.591 --> 00:22:37.298]  I'm going to revisit this situation with the Georgia mayor because this is truly disgusting and really this goes all the way up the food chain to Joe Biden, but you have to start somewhere.
[00:22:39.639 --> 00:22:46.102]  And we're going to play a series of clips, we already played some of them, but we're going to attach some other things to it that have now surfaced as well.
[00:22:47.763 --> 00:23:03.392]   In Athens, Georgia, the Democrat mayor who turned His city into a sanctuary city that allowed for the criminal, violent, likely, it's likely that this individual from Venezuela was released from a jail.
[00:23:04.052 --> 00:23:08.035]  Who knows what kind of violent crimes were on his record or even what his name was when he was in Venezuela.
[00:23:09.215 --> 00:23:16.740]  Comes here illegally, gets released into the country by Joe Biden, gets put into this Democrat sanctuary city of Athens, Georgia, tries to rape a girl who's running on the trail.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:17.881]  She fights back.
[00:23:18.421 --> 00:23:22.584]  He ends up beating her so savagely that her skull was deformed.
[00:23:25.834 --> 00:23:29.435]  And then they say, well, it's her fault because she ran on a trail.
[00:23:30.355 --> 00:23:33.356]  It's her fault because she didn't let this illegal immigrant rape her.
[00:23:35.216 --> 00:23:35.536]  Wow.
[00:23:35.916 --> 00:23:37.957]  No, it's the Democrats' fault.
[00:23:38.037 --> 00:23:39.157]  It's Joe Biden's fault.
[00:23:39.857 --> 00:23:43.798]  It's the mayor of Athens, Georgia's fault.
[00:23:46.098 --> 00:23:47.659]  They have blood on their hands.
[00:23:48.979 --> 00:24:04.947]   And if I was the family, I would be pursuing Every Democrat involved in this illegal immigrant operation, like a hound dog with a scent, and I would never give up.
[00:24:09.111 --> 00:24:11.072]  Because there will be more Lake and Rileys.
[00:24:12.674 --> 00:24:16.377]  I had a story on my desk yesterday hosting the War Room.
[00:24:16.597 --> 00:24:17.718]  I forget all the girls' names.
[00:24:18.999 --> 00:24:20.941]  Sure as hell remember George Floyd's name!
[00:24:21.902 --> 00:24:22.763]  But see, that's the point.
[00:24:23.951 --> 00:24:29.713]  There have actually been dozens of young women murdered by illegal immigrants, raped by illegal immigrants.
[00:24:30.353 --> 00:24:31.294]  Kate Steinle, one of them.
[00:24:34.475 --> 00:24:38.516]  But that's not propaganda, like George Floyd.
[00:24:38.556 --> 00:24:40.777]  George Floyd was weaponized propaganda.
[00:24:41.557 --> 00:24:51.841]  That's why the weaponized propaganda media made sure that everybody knew his name, and everybody knew his face, and everybody knew his story, because that was part of their propaganda.
[00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.272]  Are they going to do the same operation for Lake and Riley?
[00:24:55.712 --> 00:24:56.133]  No.
[00:24:57.253 --> 00:24:57.794]  Of course not.
[00:25:02.077 --> 00:25:02.598]  Of course not.
[00:25:04.139 --> 00:25:05.420]  And it's not just Lake and Riley.
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:10.444]  And so, here's the harsh reality of this situation.
[00:25:13.546 --> 00:25:23.910]   The likelihood that you tuned into this broadcast and me sitting at this desk and my crew sitting on the other side We're all gonna make it home safe and sound tonight.
[00:25:24.851 --> 00:25:29.095]  It's likely all of our friends and family and loved ones will make it home safe tonight.
[00:25:30.817 --> 00:25:32.258]  But we better realize something.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:47.632]  Every day that this invasion into our country continues, the odds of you making it home safe and your family and your loved ones making it home safe go down.
[00:25:49.994 --> 00:26:07.720]  Because believe me, as comfortable as you are today, thinking that everybody you know and yourself is going to make it home safe tonight and not be a victim of violent crime from an illegal immigrant, just as comfortable as you are sitting here, so was Lake and Riley's family just a few weeks ago.
[00:26:11.842 --> 00:26:13.102]  Now, how do you think they feel?
[00:26:15.243 --> 00:26:16.543]  But again, it's not just Lake and Riley.
[00:26:16.563 --> 00:26:18.104]  There have been dozens of Lake and Riley's.
[00:26:19.076 --> 00:26:20.096]  The media doesn't cover it.
[00:26:22.957 --> 00:26:33.921]  And if I was Lake and Riley's family, and I hope that she has a bulldog-filled legal team, I think the mayor of Athens needs to be on trial.
[00:26:34.101 --> 00:26:41.244]  I think every Democrat and Republican that's voted along with these open border bills needs to be put on trial.
[00:26:41.264 --> 00:26:44.945]  I mean, even Mike Johnson now is about to cut a deal to keep the border open.
[00:26:46.325 --> 00:26:47.785]  So put Mike Johnson on trial, too.
[00:26:48.606 --> 00:26:52.207]  Mike Johnson, you want to cut deals with dirty Chuck Schumer?
[00:26:52.887 --> 00:27:01.249]  If Speaker Mike Johnson wants to cut deals with dirty Chuck Schumer, then put Mike Johnson on trial, too, because the blood's on your hands, too.
[00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:03.930]  That's where this needs to go.
[00:27:05.991 --> 00:27:07.871]  First break here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:27:07.931 --> 00:27:10.652]  We're going to really delve into these stories and more when we come back.
[00:27:11.314 --> 00:27:14.840]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:22.251]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of, is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[00:27:22.432 --> 00:27:24.435]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[00:27:24.615 --> 00:27:25.677]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[00:27:25.697 --> 00:27:26.398]  He loved the idea.
[00:27:26.718 --> 00:27:30.239]  What would you call the debates and discussions about a pro-human future?
[00:27:30.279 --> 00:27:31.140]  Just Team Humanity?
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.100]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:32.700]  Absolutely.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.381]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[00:27:34.461 --> 00:27:37.882]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[00:27:38.142 --> 00:27:45.565]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[00:27:45.845 --> 00:27:57.576]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, that it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[00:27:57.856 --> 00:27:59.178]  We're told humans are the problem.
[00:27:59.198 --> 00:28:00.199]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[00:28:00.479 --> 00:28:04.743]  We're told all this garbage, so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[00:28:05.043 --> 00:28:05.744]  We're not going to do that.
[00:28:06.004 --> 00:28:10.649]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[00:28:12.407 --> 00:28:14.768]  Some breaking news out of Athens, Georgia.
[00:28:14.869 --> 00:28:18.951]  Two colleges have canceled classes today as police look for a murderer.
[00:28:19.791 --> 00:28:22.993]  Blakyn Riley was described as a shining light.
[00:28:23.013 --> 00:28:24.434]  Dean's List nursing student.
[00:28:24.534 --> 00:28:26.535]  Police arrested 26-year-old Jose Antonio Ibarra.
[00:28:27.876 --> 00:28:34.760]  Ibarra crossed into Texas illegally back in September of 2022, then was released into the United States on parole.
[00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:39.652]  We have a secure border.
[00:28:39.752 --> 00:28:41.774]  We agree that the border is secure.
[00:28:41.794 --> 00:28:44.736]  We have a process in place to manage migrants at the border.
[00:28:45.537 --> 00:28:46.998]  The border is closed.
[00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:48.720]  The border is secure.
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.581]  We have taken unprecedented action.
[00:28:50.621 --> 00:28:51.942]  Look, the border is not open.
[00:28:52.002 --> 00:28:57.947]  Fox News can now confirm that Jose Antonio Ubarra was busted last year in New York City.
[00:28:58.107 --> 00:29:03.107]   Ice didn't even have time to put in a detainer on him because, hey, he was already back out on the streets.
[00:29:03.107 --> 00:29:08.446]  [MUSIC]
[00:29:08.446 --> 00:29:14.107]   That is a new political ad that's gonna be airing during this election cycle.
[00:29:14.127 --> 00:29:30.755]  And I would say that conservatives, republicans, patriots are getting better in the narrative wars and in the effort to combat the false narratives produced by the left and by the democrats, no doubt about it.
[00:29:30.815 --> 00:29:33.256]  But we still have a long way to go and here's an example of this.
[00:29:35.615 --> 00:29:45.804]  And it's against my instinct, it's against our instincts, as real journalists and broadcasters, to be redundant.
[00:29:47.645 --> 00:29:56.193]  But, this is why everybody knows the name George Floyd, but most people don't know the name of Lakin Riley.
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:02.501]  So some people might be saying, well, gee, we've been covering this story for a week.
[00:30:03.161 --> 00:30:10.702]  Well, yeah, they covered George Floyd for a year to make sure you knew his name and his story in that false narrative.
[00:30:11.923 --> 00:30:17.704]  So we have to combat that by making sure people know about Lake and Riley and her story and what led to that.
[00:30:20.624 --> 00:30:21.344]  And what led to that?
[00:30:22.665 --> 00:30:24.165]  Joe Biden's open border policy.
[00:30:25.507 --> 00:30:28.469]  And the Democrat Sanctuary City Policy.
[00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:31.370]  Now, this is what happened.
[00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:32.451]  Here's the good news.
[00:30:35.052 --> 00:30:49.279]  This is what happened when the Democrat Mayor of Athens, Georgia, Kelly Gertz, went in front of the media and the public to make a statement about Laken Riley's death.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.260]  Murder.
[00:30:52.681 --> 00:30:53.301]  Brutal murder.
[00:30:54.684 --> 00:30:56.566]  By a violent criminal led in by Joe Biden.
[00:30:57.346 --> 00:31:00.249]  And the Democrats.
[00:31:00.489 --> 00:31:04.853]  So here's what happened, and I'm going to explain why this is even more significant than we realize.
[00:31:05.733 --> 00:31:09.937]  Here are the clips from the press conference.
[00:31:09.957 --> 00:31:11.118]  2019 was not that long ago.
[00:31:11.538 --> 00:31:23.068]  You might remember the dynamic we were living in, in the late teens in this country, where you had the President of the United States speaking in the most vile terms about people who were foreign born.
[00:31:24.565 --> 00:31:28.707]  And you had that notion metastasizing in places like Charlottesville.
[00:31:28.727 --> 00:31:31.248]  This is an invasion!
[00:31:31.268 --> 00:31:34.189]  In Maine, I cautioned against conflating immigration and crime.
[00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:36.950]  The data demonstrates that the two are not connected.
[00:31:39.652 --> 00:31:49.416]  Because the impact of federal immigration policy on localities has been under such consistent discussion in recent months, I do want to say a few words about this.
[00:31:51.057 --> 00:31:53.738]  It's my 18th year as a local government policymaker.
[00:31:55.086 --> 00:31:57.108]  And my work has overlapped with four U.S.
[00:31:57.148 --> 00:32:00.571]  presidencies and numerous iterations of Congress.
[00:32:02.032 --> 00:32:04.815]  All of them have failed to reach agreement on how to handle immigration.
[00:32:05.636 --> 00:32:07.377]  The city doesn't track with either of those.
[00:32:09.119 --> 00:32:13.503]  And so that term means different things to different people depending on the context of the discussion.
[00:32:14.802 --> 00:32:16.403]  We know what it means.
[00:32:16.423 --> 00:32:16.503]  Liar!
[00:32:17.084 --> 00:32:18.204]  Liar!
[00:32:18.765 --> 00:32:19.785]  You're a liar!
[00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:28.651]  You are guilty and got blood on your hands for this murder, sir!
[00:32:28.471 --> 00:32:32.390]   You're guilty and got blood on your head for this murder, sir.
[00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:36.431]   Many of the aspects that are ascribed to sanctuary cities.
[00:32:36.431 --> 00:32:37.671]  We know what sanctuary means.
[00:32:37.671 --> 00:32:40.510]  Are things that are disallowed by Georgia law.
[00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.471]  Sanctuary policy, which is what we do.
[00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:48.349]   And we contribute a document every year to the Georgia Department of Audits indicating
[00:32:48.349 --> 00:32:52.790]   that we do not correspond to these definitions under state law.
[00:32:53.016 --> 00:32:53.696]  Yes, you do.
[00:32:54.156 --> 00:32:59.459]  And no policies have been adopted by the mayor and commission that have created sanctuary city status in Athens.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.240]  You need to resign!
[00:33:01.641 --> 00:33:03.321]  One protocol that sometimes arises.
[00:33:03.382 --> 00:33:05.923]  Resign now!
[00:33:06.543 --> 00:33:09.105]  You were welcome to hop in, sir.
[00:33:09.767 --> 00:33:22.337]  One protocol that sometimes arises is the approach that sheriff's offices... Now, this is going to become a lot more common in the very near future.
[00:33:23.238 --> 00:33:29.243]  And it's already almost reached a point where Democrats really can't do anything in public without being heckled and protested.
[00:33:29.703 --> 00:33:35.588]  Whether it's Joe Biden, whether it's AOC, whether it's Nancy Pelosi, whether it's a local Democrat mayor.
[00:33:37.731 --> 00:33:39.212]  So, here's where this goes.
[00:33:39.292 --> 00:33:40.152]  We have two options.
[00:33:41.933 --> 00:33:46.855]  We can either do this peacefully and politically, which is what we're doing.
[00:33:46.955 --> 00:33:49.556]  That's the entire purpose of this transmission.
[00:33:50.116 --> 00:33:57.959]  That's the entire mindset and movement is to save this country peacefully and politically.
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.221]  But it's going to become common now.
[00:34:04.755 --> 00:34:09.398]  With press conferences like that, or anytime a Democrat has a public event, that's what you're going to see.
[00:34:11.519 --> 00:34:14.581]  Them getting called out and protested.
[00:34:15.482 --> 00:34:17.383]  And so the solution here is obvious.
[00:34:18.044 --> 00:34:23.487]  The Democrat Party has to become extinct politically in the United States of America.
[00:34:23.687 --> 00:34:24.048]  That's it!
[00:34:25.028 --> 00:34:27.870]  Peacefully, politically, we start to save the country that way.
[00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:30.312]  That's not an endorsement of the Republican Party.
[00:34:30.752 --> 00:34:33.474]  That's not to say the Republican Party hasn't been part of the problem.
[00:34:35.353 --> 00:34:51.421]  But it's pretty clear at this point that common sense, populism, nationalism are taking over the Republican Party and that's where politically this country's movement to save it is going to be deriving from.
[00:34:53.072 --> 00:35:02.099]  So, to save this country, the easiest way, peacefully and politically, the Democrat Party has to become extinct in the next four years.
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:08.844]  You can't have any more Democrat representatives locally, and really it needs to become extinct at the national level as well.
[00:35:09.205 --> 00:35:10.005]  That's what has to happen.
[00:35:10.886 --> 00:35:11.186]  Why?
[00:35:11.206 --> 00:35:13.048]  Here's why.
[00:35:13.288 --> 00:35:40.083]   Because here's that same mayor in 2019, he wants to blame Donald Trump, but here he is in 2019, The Athens-Clarke County Unified Government is welcoming to people from all lands and backgrounds and strives to foster a community where individuals and families of all statuses feel safe, are able to prosper, and can breathe free.
[00:35:41.325 --> 00:35:42.085]  Now what does he mean?
[00:35:42.345 --> 00:35:44.846]  All statuses can feel safe?
[00:35:45.007 --> 00:35:47.968]  No, he's talking about illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities.
[00:35:48.008 --> 00:35:50.629]  He's talking about criminals in Democrat-run cities.
[00:35:51.089 --> 00:35:52.470]  Do you think the locals feel safe now?
[00:35:53.510 --> 00:36:10.277]  Do you think the thousands of women, the thousands of nursing students in Athens, Georgia that might want to go for a run tonight, maybe on their own, do you think they feel safe?
[00:36:11.544 --> 00:36:16.706]  Do you think Lake and Riley's friends feel safe now if they go out at night for a jog?
[00:36:17.367 --> 00:36:18.507]  Do you think they feel safe?
[00:36:22.149 --> 00:36:24.410]  So he's not talking about citizens of Athens.
[00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:26.651]  He's not talking about Americans.
[00:36:27.432 --> 00:36:29.993]  He's talking about criminal, illegal immigrants.
[00:36:31.474 --> 00:36:33.274]  So this is going to become commonplace now.
[00:36:33.395 --> 00:36:34.875]  Everybody knows who's to blame for this.
[00:36:35.235 --> 00:36:40.338]  They can lie and deceive and spin it all they want.
[00:36:41.347 --> 00:36:43.347]  But they're not fooling anybody.
[00:36:43.347 --> 00:36:50.347]   Lake and Riley's murder, the direct result of immigration laws, passed by New York City Democrats, says a councilman.
[00:36:50.347 --> 00:36:53.347]  You're a liar, you have blood on your hands.
[00:36:53.347 --> 00:36:59.717]   Athens, Georgia residents rip apart woke mayor after he lies about role in illegal alien murder of beloved college
[00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:00.347]  student.
[00:37:00.347 --> 00:37:07.347]   Again, dozens of American women have been raped and murdered by illegal immigrants.
[00:37:07.241 --> 00:37:07.822]  Dozens!
[00:37:08.423 --> 00:37:12.728]  We don't know their names because they don't get humanized.
[00:37:13.649 --> 00:37:17.715]  They don't get the massive propaganda pushes like, say, a George Floyd.
[00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:25.394]  Guatemalan child sex predator arrested by ICE after released by Massachusetts judge.
[00:37:25.754 --> 00:37:30.837]  A known child predator released by a liberal judge in Massachusetts.
[00:37:30.937 --> 00:37:31.858]  ICE has to re-arrest him.
[00:37:34.179 --> 00:37:38.862]  Thousands of migrant children have gone missing from sponsor home probe reveals.
[00:37:39.283 --> 00:37:44.226]  So yeah, they send all these unaccompanied minors to quote-unquote sponsor homes and then they just disappear.
[00:37:44.246 --> 00:37:46.327]  What do you think happens to them?
[00:37:46.347 --> 00:37:49.089]  Remember that story of the woman in Ohio that got pregnant?
[00:37:50.652 --> 00:37:54.695]  And then they quit covering it because they found out it looked like it was an illegal immigrant sex ring?
[00:37:54.715 --> 00:37:56.036]  We remember!
[00:37:56.536 --> 00:37:57.657]  We're gonna finish the job.
[00:37:58.198 --> 00:38:03.341]  We're gonna ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines next time around, because it has to be done.
[00:38:03.842 --> 00:38:04.962]  We're gonna finish the job.
[00:38:05.503 --> 00:38:10.647]  We're gonna ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines next time around, because it has to be done.
[00:38:11.147 --> 00:38:12.268]  We're gonna finish the job.
[00:38:12.788 --> 00:38:17.952]  We're gonna ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines next time around, because it has to be done.
[00:38:18.392 --> 00:38:19.453]  We're gonna finish the job.
[00:38:20.031 --> 00:38:25.174]  We're gonna ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines next time around because it has to be done.
[00:38:25.674 --> 00:38:26.795]  We're gonna finish the job.
[00:38:27.335 --> 00:38:32.458]  We're gonna ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines next time around because it has to be done.
[00:38:32.578 --> 00:38:35.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, understand the historical impact of this.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.021]  Understand what you're seeing.
[00:38:37.081 --> 00:38:41.784]  Understand what you're hearing here from Joe Biden.
[00:38:42.424 --> 00:38:48.668]  And then juxtapose that with what they're doing to Donald Trump in the corrupt court system.
[00:38:49.983 --> 00:38:52.625]  And taking him off the ballot and politically persecuting him.
[00:38:53.565 --> 00:39:02.471]  Understand this moment of history and understand what it will represent and the stories that will be told depending on the future of this country.
[00:39:04.112 --> 00:39:08.135]  If the Democrats win, because there's only two outcomes.
[00:39:09.055 --> 00:39:10.696]  Only one survives.
[00:39:12.117 --> 00:39:16.280]  Either the United States of America survives or the Democrat Party survives.
[00:39:18.261 --> 00:39:19.242]  The two cannot survive.
[00:39:20.811 --> 00:39:35.156]  There will either be a one-party rule, that's the Democrat Party, and the United States of America over as we know it, or the United States of America survives and the Democrat Party goes extinct politically.
[00:39:36.617 --> 00:39:51.746]   But understand, even the Democrat Party will eventually fall, just like all other tyrant and authoritarian regimes do, and depending on how far they get into their plan, Will be how bad it will get.
[00:39:54.248 --> 00:40:01.674]  But understand, a clip like that, a statement like that from Joe Biden, this is history making stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:02.375 --> 00:40:12.843]  So when America collapses or the Democrats engage in mass murder and mass persecution, like what we've seen before, this is nothing new.
[00:40:14.284 --> 00:40:15.445]  Don't forget about Ruby Ridge.
[00:40:20.339 --> 00:40:22.020]  When the U.S.
[00:40:22.081 --> 00:40:30.488]  government starts committing mass murder at the behest of the Democrat Party and the Biden Administration, it'll be clips like that that we remember.
[00:40:30.848 --> 00:40:38.474]  When the Democrat Party starts going door-to-door to round up hundreds of thousands of dissidents, they already have thousands that they've arrested.
[00:40:38.515 --> 00:40:42.698]  They already have thousands of people that they've incarcerated, politically persecuted.
[00:40:43.339 --> 00:40:44.700]  The numbers are already in the thousands.
[00:40:46.266 --> 00:40:49.987]  Next it'll be tens of thousands, then it'll be hundreds of thousands, and you'll be disarmed.
[00:40:50.087 --> 00:40:55.628]  And it'll be moments like this and clips like this that we say, ah, this is how we got here.
[00:40:58.469 --> 00:41:07.111]  Those are the clips, those are the statements that will be played as history recalls how America fell.
[00:41:08.331 --> 00:41:08.931]  How U.S.
[00:41:08.971 --> 00:41:10.292]  citizens lost their rights.
[00:41:11.692 --> 00:41:14.753]  How authoritarianism took over the United States of America.
[00:41:15.874 --> 00:41:20.578]  Leading to the death and the slaughter of American citizens.
[00:41:21.258 --> 00:41:26.182]  It will be Joe Biden saying, we're going to finish the job, we're going to take the assault weapons.
[00:41:27.963 --> 00:41:29.324]  And then what do you think they'll do to you?
[00:41:31.125 --> 00:41:34.248]  There'll be Ruby Ridges all across this country.
[00:41:38.071 --> 00:41:42.374]  So, you've got the Biden administration openly coming out against the Second Amendment.
[00:41:44.907 --> 00:41:46.988]  Obviously they're against the First Amendment as well.
[00:41:49.008 --> 00:41:52.809]  And then you have the political persecution against their opposition, Donald Trump.
[00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:57.030]  Now you have a judge in Illinois.
[00:41:57.611 --> 00:42:00.811]  Judge orders President Trump removed from ballot in Illinois.
[00:42:00.911 --> 00:42:12.212]   Cook County Judge Tracy Porter Put the ruling on hold so Trump can appeal according to Chicago local news, which means Trump will remain on the ballot until further notice.
[00:42:12.473 --> 00:42:15.313]  She wants him just off, but she doesn't have all that power.
[00:42:18.454 --> 00:42:22.154]  And they're claiming it is because of an insurrection clause.
[00:42:22.174 --> 00:42:23.855]  Of course, nobody's been charged with insurrection.
[00:42:24.075 --> 00:42:29.976]  Specifically, Donald Trump hasn't been charged with insurrection, but you think the truth gets in the way of a good liberal lie?
[00:42:31.613 --> 00:42:35.854]  You think the truth gets in the way of Democrat Party persecution and criminal activity?
[00:42:35.874 --> 00:42:36.534]  Of course not.
[00:42:38.135 --> 00:42:39.855]  These are hardcore criminals.
[00:42:42.116 --> 00:42:43.496]  It's a gangster mafia.
[00:42:45.356 --> 00:42:47.997]  And it's not a coincidence that this is another black woman judge.
[00:42:48.277 --> 00:42:48.997]  This is what they've done.
[00:42:49.037 --> 00:42:52.178]  They've weaponized black women.
[00:42:53.558 --> 00:42:56.199]  And then they put them into positions of power with affirmative action.
[00:42:56.299 --> 00:42:57.179]  It's all by design.
[00:42:58.019 --> 00:42:59.580]  It's all by design.
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:00.420]  It's not a coincidence.
[00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:05.403]  Letitia James, Fannie Willis, Tracy Porter.
[00:43:06.864 --> 00:43:07.865]  It's not a coincidence, folks.
[00:43:08.125 --> 00:43:08.746]  It's by design.
[00:43:10.687 --> 00:43:11.828]  It's all by design.
[00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.452]  Trump will be on the ballot in Illinois, by the way.
[00:43:20.077 --> 00:43:27.879]  New York Attorney General Letitia James files lawsuit against world's largest beef producer for misleading public about its impact on climate change.
[00:43:27.919 --> 00:43:31.760]  Now see, this is just like what they've done to Trump.
[00:43:33.701 --> 00:43:38.302]  Trump committed fraud by saying Mar-a-Lago is worth more than $18 million.
[00:43:38.422 --> 00:43:41.643]  Of course, Mar-a-Lago is worth at least $300 million.
[00:43:42.503 --> 00:43:44.404]  Probably a low conservative estimate.
[00:43:45.486 --> 00:43:46.347]  But they all know that.
[00:43:47.087 --> 00:43:50.489]  So the fraud gets committed against Donald Trump, and then they say Trump committed the fraud.
[00:43:50.709 --> 00:43:53.051]  Well, it's the same thing with this climate change.
[00:43:55.432 --> 00:44:00.155]  The world's largest beef producer isn't misleading the public about climate change.
[00:44:00.616 --> 00:44:01.576]  It's the liberals.
[00:44:01.716 --> 00:44:02.617]  It's the Democrats.
[00:44:02.797 --> 00:44:04.078]  It's the Green New Agenda.
[00:44:05.039 --> 00:44:06.339]  It's the carbon neutral lies.
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.741]  They're the ones that lie about climate change.
[00:44:09.582 --> 00:44:11.483]  They're the ones that lie about the environment.
[00:44:13.706 --> 00:44:18.929]  They're the ones misleading the public on carbon emissions and climate change and everything else.
[00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:21.131]  And then they say, you're doing it.
[00:44:25.714 --> 00:44:26.434]  That's what they do.
[00:44:28.515 --> 00:44:29.416]  That's what these pigs do.
[00:44:34.389 --> 00:44:37.371]  Until we take away their power, they will continue to do this.
[00:44:37.571 --> 00:44:43.335]  MSNBC contributor calls on Democrats to strip power from the Supreme Court after Trump ruling.
[00:44:43.875 --> 00:44:47.858]  You understand that the Democrats are the authoritarians they're warning you about?
[00:44:48.998 --> 00:44:53.241]  You understand that the Democrats are the tyrants they warn you about?
[00:44:54.462 --> 00:45:03.831]   You understand that the left-wing ideology is the deadly Authoritarian ideology that they claim to be fighting?
[00:45:04.191 --> 00:45:04.731]  It's them!
[00:45:07.453 --> 00:45:13.996]  So, the Supreme Court, another stopgap from authoritarianism and tyranny in the United States of America.
[00:45:14.316 --> 00:45:15.777]  So what is the Democrat solution?
[00:45:16.197 --> 00:45:17.318]  Get rid of the Supreme Court!
[00:45:22.281 --> 00:45:28.284]  I will bet you, if the Democrats win the White House for another four years, they will pack the Supreme Court.
[00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:30.750]  Guaranteed.
[00:45:33.812 --> 00:45:56.967]  If the Democrats get the White House for another four years, they'll probably add six seats to the Supreme Court and they'll put the most hardcore anti-American bigots on the bench to further their initiative for a one-party rule and authoritarian dictatorship run by them in the United States of America.
[00:45:57.168 --> 00:45:58.589]  They tell you their plans!
[00:45:59.801 --> 00:46:03.063]  I'm not even up here, that's not even me up here predicting something.
[00:46:03.403 --> 00:46:04.743]  That's their plan!
[00:46:04.824 --> 00:46:06.184]  They're public about it!
[00:46:08.085 --> 00:46:15.689]  It's like if an NFL coach comes out before the Super Bowl and says, well, we really want to pass the ball.
[00:46:17.205 --> 00:46:19.786]  I think I'm going to have my quarterback throw the ball 50 times.
[00:46:20.346 --> 00:46:21.726]  We really want to throw the ball a lot.
[00:46:21.766 --> 00:46:22.827]  I think we're going to pass it a lot.
[00:46:23.287 --> 00:46:27.108]  And then I come out and I say, well, they're going to throw the ball a lot in this game.
[00:46:27.148 --> 00:46:28.688]  I think they're going to be passing the ball.
[00:46:29.148 --> 00:46:30.669]  Sounds like they really want to pass the ball.
[00:46:31.449 --> 00:46:32.409]  And then they pass the ball.
[00:46:32.489 --> 00:46:34.050]  It's like, oh my gosh, how did he know?
[00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:34.830]  What do you mean?
[00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:35.650]  They said that.
[00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:38.131]  Hey, the Democrats are going to expand the Supreme Court.
[00:46:38.151 --> 00:46:39.391]  They want to nullify the Supreme Court.
[00:46:39.871 --> 00:46:40.471]  And then it happens.
[00:46:40.531 --> 00:46:41.412]  Oh my gosh, how did you know?
[00:46:41.432 --> 00:46:41.752]  What do you mean?
[00:46:41.792 --> 00:46:42.672]  They said they were going to do that.
[00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:47.531]  Hey, the Democrats are going to politically persecute Trump with all these corrupt judges.
[00:46:48.211 --> 00:46:48.751]  And then they do it.
[00:46:48.771 --> 00:46:50.151]  How did you know that was going to happen?
[00:46:50.171 --> 00:46:50.531]  What do you mean?
[00:46:50.551 --> 00:46:51.152]  That's what they do.
[00:46:51.192 --> 00:46:52.332]  That's what they said they were going to do.
[00:46:52.892 --> 00:46:55.773]  Letitia James ran that she would go after Trump if she won.
[00:46:58.313 --> 00:46:59.613]  But these are the dirtbags.
[00:47:01.574 --> 00:47:03.314]  These are the dirtbags going after President Trump.
[00:47:03.494 --> 00:47:05.495]  This whole Fannie Willis thing is falling apart at the seams.
[00:47:06.135 --> 00:47:15.972]   Nathan Wade's attorney's text messages to Trump co-defendant attorney reveal He lied in court and Fannie Willis started dating Nathan Wade before taking office.
[00:47:16.012 --> 00:47:22.815]  So it's just like Peter Stroke and Lisa Page, sleeping around, slobbering all over one another, and then engaging in FBI corruption.
[00:47:23.175 --> 00:47:33.000]  Same thing going on with Nathan Wade and Fannie Willis, sleeping around, sucking each other off, and talking about how they're going to destroy Donald Trump, and then lying about it under oath.
[00:47:35.379 --> 00:47:37.460]  And then you may call it a legal victory.
[00:47:39.322 --> 00:47:41.023]  It's hardly any victories for Trump, really.
[00:47:41.063 --> 00:47:46.726]  But in blow to special counsel Jack Smith, Supreme Court agrees to hear Trump immunity appeal.
[00:47:47.247 --> 00:47:49.588]  The only reason why this is a victory is because it delays the case.
[00:47:49.989 --> 00:47:54.051]  And that's really the only hope that the Trump team has, is to delay it as long as possible.
[00:47:54.091 --> 00:47:55.452]  Because there's no hope for justice.
[00:47:56.313 --> 00:47:59.155]  So the hope is to just delay it as long as possible.
[00:47:59.995 --> 00:48:01.416]  And then win the presidency.
[00:48:01.456 --> 00:48:02.157]  That's the strategy.
[00:48:01.977 --> 00:48:12.977]  because there's no justice when Democrats are in control.
[00:48:13.088 --> 00:48:14.912]  I have to say it, it really pisses me off.
[00:48:15.669 --> 00:48:21.352]  To hear when you say that only 2% of the people that listen to this broadcast buy products.
[00:48:22.212 --> 00:48:23.233]  Um, I'm a young man.
[00:48:23.453 --> 00:48:24.433]  I don't make that much money.
[00:48:24.773 --> 00:48:25.534]  I just bought a house.
[00:48:25.634 --> 00:48:26.414]  I just got married.
[00:48:26.634 --> 00:48:28.195]  I buy the products as much as I can.
[00:48:28.295 --> 00:48:29.496]  I buy them almost every month.
[00:48:29.736 --> 00:48:32.397]  I've bought the iodine, the beets, the methylfolate.
[00:48:32.437 --> 00:48:33.138]  I've just tried it.
[00:48:33.278 --> 00:48:35.959]  It's absurd to me that you people are listening to this guy.
[00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:37.200]  I've listened to you for 10 years.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:40.121]  He puts this show out here for free, and you're not supporting him.
[00:48:40.221 --> 00:48:44.043]  Our country is falling apart, but you've got millions of people listening to you not doing sh**.
[00:48:44.643 --> 00:48:45.244]  Excuse my French.
[00:48:45.444 --> 00:48:47.166]  But look, look, there's a glut of media.
[00:48:47.186 --> 00:48:48.127]  There's so much media.
[00:48:48.187 --> 00:48:48.888]  I'm not blaming the 99%.
[00:48:49.008 --> 00:48:52.011]  It's the 99% that never buy anything.
[00:48:52.511 --> 00:48:54.073]  It's just these are really good products.
[00:48:54.153 --> 00:48:58.697]  And if we just had 1% more by the products, it would change the whole world.
[00:48:58.777 --> 00:49:00.619]  So these are really great products to begin with.
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.581]  We have the best turmeric out there.
[00:49:02.601 --> 00:49:04.003]  95% humanoid.
[00:49:04.083 --> 00:49:05.724]  Incredible anti-inflammation.
[00:49:05.904 --> 00:49:06.985]  So good for your whole body.
[00:49:07.086 --> 00:49:08.507]  We have all the other great products at InfoWars.
[00:49:08.867 --> 00:49:27.641]  I've been taking it for, I don't know, a couple weeks now and in my younger days I've experimented with stimulants and those things.
[00:49:27.821 --> 00:49:29.002]  It feels nothing like that.
[00:49:29.042 --> 00:49:30.503]  You feel like you're supposed to feel it.
[00:49:30.523 --> 00:49:33.445]  You're supposed to have energy, you know, and that's pretty much it.
[00:49:33.505 --> 00:49:34.726]  It doesn't feel like a stimulant.
[00:49:34.746 --> 00:49:45.657]   You just feel like you're supposed to And what it does is it's the breakdown of folic acid that almost everybody, but particularly some people, northern Europeans, have a low breakdown of.
[00:49:46.038 --> 00:49:50.943]  So you just give yourselves the direct food that they operate off of and they clean out with.
[00:49:51.383 --> 00:49:53.526]  That's why next level financial energy is so important.
[00:49:53.626 --> 00:49:55.626]  Thank you for the call, Victor, and thanks for the plug.
[00:49:55.626 --> 00:50:10.226]   We're about to be joined by Ezra Levant from Rebel News Media.
[00:50:10.226 --> 00:50:20.226]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:50:13.783 --> 00:50:18.024]  Let's quickly... I don't even know where to go here.
[00:50:18.044 --> 00:50:19.285]  It's just all so crazy.
[00:50:23.806 --> 00:50:27.987]  Let's have a little comedic relief here.
[00:50:28.007 --> 00:50:29.608]  This is the great comedian J.P.
[00:50:30.128 --> 00:50:30.548]  Sears.
[00:50:32.089 --> 00:50:42.578]   Properly Using comedy to explain just how ludicrous the current Democrat policy is dealing with law enforcement and illegal immigration.
[00:50:44.398 --> 00:50:46.559]  Illegal immigrants are above the law and the U.S.
[00:50:46.579 --> 00:50:48.499]  taxpayer are the criminals.
[00:50:49.219 --> 00:50:57.922]  And so here's Awaken with JP with a comedic bit about how Democrats approach law enforcement and illegal immigration in clip 10.
[00:50:59.362 --> 00:51:00.062]  Oh my God!
[00:51:00.143 --> 00:51:01.523]  That man is attacking a woman!
[00:51:04.864 --> 00:51:05.644]  Yeah, he sure is.
[00:51:06.064 --> 00:51:07.124]  Are you gonna do something?
[00:51:07.685 --> 00:51:17.506]  Well, you see, that there man pummeling that woman in the face, very viciously, I might add, he is an illegal alien and she is a citizen of New York.
[00:51:17.746 --> 00:51:25.828]  And you see, Mayor Adams has made it a crime for us to stop crime that's being perpetrated on citizens of New York by people who are illegally here.
[00:51:26.648 --> 00:51:28.088]  Sanctuary City kind of thing.
[00:51:28.388 --> 00:51:30.068]  He's beating her to a pulp!
[00:51:30.148 --> 00:51:30.889]  You're the police!
[00:51:30.989 --> 00:51:31.729]  Do something!
[00:51:31.749 --> 00:51:32.589]  Oh, right.
[00:51:33.697 --> 00:51:39.621]  Excuse me, sir, I have a debit card worth $10,000 for you, funded with taxpayer money.
[00:51:39.641 --> 00:51:47.706]  Oh, and because I'm not checking your ID, because that would be illegal here in New York, you can just go get another one in about an hour or so.
[00:51:47.726 --> 00:51:51.408]  Yeah, I'll tell you, it's nice to see them beating up a woman for a change.
[00:51:51.728 --> 00:51:53.549]  Usually they're attacking us police officers.
[00:51:55.971 --> 00:52:02.775]  So JPC is using comedy to exhibit a major issue we have.
[00:52:05.148 --> 00:52:05.949]  But that's what it is.
[00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:09.071]  Just ask the citizens of New York.
[00:52:09.091 --> 00:52:14.236]  But again, I go back to the clip where the mayor in Athens is getting heckled and protested by the locals.
[00:52:15.136 --> 00:52:16.578]  Everybody gets it now, folks.
[00:52:17.278 --> 00:52:18.359]  Everybody gets it now.
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:22.763]  They're seeing their recreation centers being given to illegal immigrants.
[00:52:22.783 --> 00:52:25.025]  They're seeing their schools being given to illegal immigrants.
[00:52:25.285 --> 00:52:27.507]  They're seeing the hotels being given to illegal immigrants.
[00:52:28.027 --> 00:52:29.208]  Their pockets are lighter.
[00:52:29.228 --> 00:52:30.549]  Their bank accounts are lighter.
[00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:33.312]  And they say, well, wait a second, what about us?
[00:52:34.827 --> 00:52:36.087]  And they know it's the Democrats.
[00:52:36.667 --> 00:52:38.008]  They can try to hide it as much as possible.
[00:52:38.268 --> 00:52:39.188]  I've got so much more on this.
[00:52:40.208 --> 00:52:55.172]  So now all the illegal immigrants are coming into California and they're turning the airport there into an illegal immigrant station that'll be temporary and then they'll build illegal immigrant centers all over San Diego, all over California.
[00:52:56.068 --> 00:53:01.637]  And so then maybe the people in California will suffer the same realization that people in Texas and other areas.
[00:53:02.558 --> 00:53:06.664]  I mean, here's just a look at one of the migrant shelters in San Diego in clip two.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:14.369]   Jim Diesen telling this nation that since Friday over 2000 migrants have been street release into the community
[00:53:14.369 --> 00:53:17.200]   predominantly Single men have been released by broken trojans
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.059]   And it was a center of much debate during the Board of Supervisors meeting on Tuesday
[00:53:21.059 --> 00:53:27.559]   Officials decided to approve a plan to develop a long-term Migrant transfer site in to secure federal funding for it
[00:53:27.559 --> 00:53:32.039]   despite the most long-term supervisor Desmond is disappointed in that vote this
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:39.399]   federally funded long-term shelter here is just being complicit with the federal government in the current mess and the
[00:53:39.399 --> 00:53:42.120]   fact that they're not upholding the current laws
[00:53:42.256 --> 00:53:43.296]  They're making this mess.
[00:53:43.816 --> 00:53:50.418]  I do not want to be complicit in a system, in a symptom of a failed and broken system.
[00:53:50.578 --> 00:53:51.799]  That needs to be fixed first.
[00:53:54.488 --> 00:53:59.073]  And it's just not the border town of San Diego that's now being impacted with this financial burden.
[00:53:59.133 --> 00:54:02.917]  El Paso is also set to run out of funds to address that migrant surge.
[00:54:02.937 --> 00:54:09.024]  But later today, Marc, here at this transit center, we're expecting to see just another drop-off of hundreds of migrants released into the community.
[00:54:09.044 --> 00:54:13.489]  Essentially, with nowhere to go, there's no design facility to assist their transportation.
[00:54:13.529 --> 00:54:15.511]  That's what county officials are trying to solve as soon as they can.
[00:54:16.121 --> 00:54:18.302]  Jorge Ventura, so this is what's going to happen, folks.
[00:54:18.342 --> 00:54:22.103]  It's going to get worse, but the political reckoning is going to boomerang.
[00:54:22.843 --> 00:54:28.325]  There's going to be hundreds of people killed by illegal immigrants this year, probably dozens if not hundreds of women raped.
[00:54:29.385 --> 00:54:30.706]  And there's going to pour in by the millions.
[00:54:32.306 --> 00:54:33.167]  And we're all going to witness it.
[00:54:34.547 --> 00:54:35.428]  That's what our leaders do.
[00:54:35.488 --> 00:54:37.588]  They're traitors to the country, just like they are in Canada.
[00:54:37.728 --> 00:54:39.469]  Ezra Levant will explain that when we come back.
[00:54:39.649 --> 00:54:47.146]   Ezra Levant is not just A groundbreaker in the Canadian media.
[00:54:47.186 --> 00:54:49.527]  He's also an extremely concerned citizen.
[00:54:50.268 --> 00:54:58.272]  And he joins me now for the hour to talk about what Justin Trudeau is doing to censor Canadians' speech.
[00:54:58.432 --> 00:55:18.428]   And Ezra, I guess I would start this by saying, when Justin Trudeau comes out and talks about the rise of authoritarianism and anti-democratic activities, Does he not see the irony in these statements when he makes them to the public?
[00:55:18.528 --> 00:55:19.868]  Surely the Canadian people do.
[00:55:21.689 --> 00:55:25.231]  Yeah, I mean, he is a gaslighter extraordinaire.
[00:55:25.251 --> 00:55:28.212]  I don't know if you've ever heard the phrase DARVO.
[00:55:28.312 --> 00:55:30.333]  It's a psychological term.
[00:55:30.393 --> 00:55:32.073]  It's a deny.
[00:55:32.093 --> 00:55:37.996]  And then it's used sometimes, for example, to talk about psychological abuse.
[00:55:38.336 --> 00:55:40.617]  I want to make sure I get the exact acronym.
[00:55:41.317 --> 00:55:42.738]  Deny, attack.
[00:55:43.579 --> 00:55:45.080]  And reverse victim and offender.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.140]  That's DARVO.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.721]  So that's a kind of psychological manipulation.
[00:55:49.201 --> 00:55:59.545]  So Justin Trudeau, who wore blackface in three different decades of his life, when he was a teen, when he was in his 20s, when he was 30s, he wore blackface so many times he couldn't keep track.
[00:56:00.346 --> 00:56:06.928]  When he calls you the racist, he does the DARVO, deny, attack, and reverse victim and offender.
[00:56:07.529 --> 00:56:10.690]  He sexually assaulted a young woman named Rose Knight.
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:13.884]  But he'll call you the sexist.
[00:56:14.324 --> 00:56:27.857]   So the key to understanding Trudeau is as a psychological manipulator, he'll use the language of civil liberties While declaring martial law on his own people, which is what he did when the trucker convoy came to Ottawa.
[00:56:28.177 --> 00:56:32.999]  That martial law, called the Emergencies Act, was never even used during 9-11.
[00:56:33.899 --> 00:56:37.681]  But Trudeau inflicted it on peaceful protesters who were embarrassing him.
[00:56:38.141 --> 00:56:44.103]  You have to understand what a sociopath Trudeau is to understand what we're about to go through here.
[00:56:44.764 --> 00:56:58.541]   And I gotta tell you, Owen, Alex Jones is the master of these stories, but you actually have suffered Personally, the fate that many Canadians will suffer if this new censorship bill passes.
[00:56:58.942 --> 00:57:00.784]  Your experience recently.
[00:57:01.559 --> 00:57:08.580]  The January 6th experience will be codified into law in Canada if this bill passes.
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:18.482]  Frankly, you're the one person in America who I think will understand the threat and the gravity here, and I'd like to take you through it if I may.
[00:57:19.162 --> 00:57:26.544]  You might find it, or I think other people might find it hard to believe, but I think you'll know what I'm talking about is the real threat and it's imminent.
[00:57:27.024 --> 00:57:28.744]  Well, and here's what people need to understand.
[00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:33.471]  I am just a test case, if you will.
[00:57:34.011 --> 00:57:36.771]  I am just a precedent-setting case, if you will.
[00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:46.613]  But even in my case, my case will be like nothing compared to what it's going to be like in a decade, let alone 50 years.
[00:57:46.633 --> 00:57:55.215]  A jail sentence, going through all the legal issues, dealing with probation, that'll be like a slap on the wrist.
[00:57:55.535 --> 00:57:58.456]  Soon it'll be, your 10-year sentence will be the minimum.
[00:57:59.229 --> 00:58:00.730]  For engaging in a speech crime?
[00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:01.851]  Yeah.
[00:58:02.091 --> 00:58:02.972]  Well, you know what?
[00:58:03.232 --> 00:58:09.176]  This new bill called C-63 was introduced by Trudeau this week.
[00:58:09.856 --> 00:58:27.842]   It's about a hundred pages long and there are probably ten different nuclear bombs in there in regards to civil liberties and I'd love just to dig into them and I think Like I say, you'll probably believe me, but your viewers might say, that can't be.
[00:58:28.202 --> 00:58:40.067]  You know, Scott Adams, the great critical thinker and skeptic, he reviewed C63 and he tweeted just a few hours ago, he said, this can't be right.
[00:58:40.587 --> 00:58:41.788]  Something's got to be off here.
[00:58:42.248 --> 00:58:51.733]   He says, I've seen the primary documents, I've seen the source documents, but I just can't believe this is happening because he has not been Through the looking glass like you have.
[00:58:52.334 --> 00:59:04.507]  I went through a version of this about 15 years ago when I published the Danish cartoons of Mohammed and I was investigated for 900 days by something called the Human Rights Commission.
[00:59:05.465 --> 00:59:08.708]  And so I was through sort of a beta test of this.
[00:59:09.189 --> 00:59:10.590]  But let me tell you what the real deal is.
[00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:11.111]  Are you ready?
[00:59:11.131 --> 00:59:12.532]  Should I just start going through the law?
[00:59:12.772 --> 00:59:16.176]  Yeah, let's go through this because it's important that people understand as well.
[00:59:16.436 --> 00:59:20.500]  Like you're saying, when Scott Adams reads through this, he says, what?
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:21.301]  I don't even believe this.
[00:59:21.641 --> 00:59:22.982]  And you mentioned my case.
[00:59:23.162 --> 00:59:23.923]  Same thing happened.
[00:59:23.963 --> 00:59:27.687]  When people read my hearing sentencing documents, they said, wait a second.
[00:59:28.027 --> 00:59:30.368]  You're being imprisoned for chanting USA?
[00:59:30.808 --> 00:59:32.148]  You're being imprisoned for chanting 1776?
[00:59:32.788 --> 00:59:33.828]  Yes!
[00:59:34.228 --> 00:59:35.069]  Quite literally!
[00:59:35.169 --> 00:59:36.189]  It's in their own documents!
[00:59:36.389 --> 00:59:37.789]  So that's how shocking this is.
[00:59:38.169 --> 00:59:48.211]  Ezra Levant, Rebel News Media, lay into these shocking, disturbing, almost impossible to believe laws that Justin Trudeau wants to put on the books.
[00:59:49.152 --> 00:59:49.352]  Sure.
[00:59:49.392 --> 00:59:55.398]   Well, I'm just going to start going because There's about 10 things I want to share with you, so I won't linger too long on any one of them.
[00:59:55.979 --> 01:00:01.145]  But Owen, if there's anything you want to ask me about to explain, you just interrupt me and let me know.
[01:00:02.006 --> 01:00:07.076]   The first thing you need to know is that hate is obviously a human emotion.
[01:00:07.156 --> 01:00:08.257]  We all know that.
[01:00:08.557 --> 01:00:13.578]  Sometimes we feel love, sometimes we feel hate, sometimes we feel contempt, sometimes we feel respect.
[01:00:13.858 --> 01:00:15.479]  That's a normal human personality.
[01:00:15.759 --> 01:00:21.900]  And you can no more ban hate than you could pass the Love Each Other Act to command us all to love each other.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.301]  It's just part of human nature.
[01:00:23.641 --> 01:00:32.103]  And what we do as grown-ups is we try and control our hatred and transform it into positive energy to affect change, to campaign for a better world, whatever.
[01:00:33.093 --> 01:00:35.734]  You cannot eradicate hate from the human heart.
[01:00:36.794 --> 01:00:44.136]  I guess the essence of this Bill C-63 is it turns that feeling into a crime.
[01:00:44.176 --> 01:00:45.796]  It's not even a thought crime, Owen.
[01:00:46.196 --> 01:00:47.897]  It's a feelings crime.
[01:00:48.317 --> 01:00:57.159]  And let me just tell you, I think the building block of all this is that this law says it is now a crime.
[01:00:57.779 --> 01:01:04.010]   It is a form of discrimination To express hate on the Internet.
[01:01:04.551 --> 01:01:06.212]  Actually, it's not even that blunt.
[01:01:06.772 --> 01:01:22.743]  If you say anything, even if it's true, Owen, even if it's reporting the news, Owen, that causes another person to make it, quote, likely to feel, to detest or vilify someone.
[01:01:22.983 --> 01:01:31.485]   So if you say something like you were just talking about You were playing a clip about illegal immigrants committing crimes.
[01:01:32.046 --> 01:01:37.287]  So that little video clip you showed about five minutes ago, that was not hateful.
[01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:40.168]  But if, I don't think, it was humorous.
[01:01:40.528 --> 01:01:55.793]  But if that was likely to expose a person to hatred or contempt, likely to cause someone to have hard feelings about someone else based on certain protected characteristics, that would be a hate crime.
[01:01:56.781 --> 01:02:05.968]  So let's say you did a political commentary or a humorous sketch or you just read the news and that caused someone to have hard feelings, that's a crime.
[01:02:06.108 --> 01:02:12.233]  Even if they don't act on it, even if it didn't actually happen, because the key word in the law is likely to.
[01:02:13.093 --> 01:02:15.955]  Likely to expose a person to detestation.
[01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:16.756]  Likely to.
[01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:17.657]  It's a future crime.
[01:02:17.697 --> 01:02:18.717]  It's a pre-crime.
[01:02:19.118 --> 01:02:21.779]   So now that you know that, Let me go through it.
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.660]  And also, let's just lay it out.
[01:02:25.261 --> 01:02:29.622]  What you're saying is this bill would make that illegal.
[01:02:29.882 --> 01:02:34.384]  This bill would make that comedy sketch that we played illegal.
[01:02:34.704 --> 01:02:38.046]  And the obvious question here would be, well, who decides what hate is?
[01:02:38.306 --> 01:02:40.006]  Well, we obviously have it figured out.
[01:02:40.106 --> 01:02:40.607]  It's them.
[01:02:40.887 --> 01:02:44.188]  They decide what hate is, and it's going to be whatever works for their political agenda.
[01:02:45.049 --> 01:02:50.354]  Well, remember what Lavrentiy Beria, the early secret police capo under Stalin said.
[01:02:50.374 --> 01:02:51.274]  You remember what he said?
[01:02:51.615 --> 01:02:54.297]  He said, show me the man and I'll find you the crime.
[01:02:54.377 --> 01:02:55.198]  What does that mean?
[01:02:55.658 --> 01:03:03.204]  That means there are so many laws that are so vague and so open to political manipulation that we, everyone is guilty already.
[01:03:03.244 --> 01:03:04.486]  They just need to be charged.
[01:03:05.006 --> 01:03:11.815]   So the likely to expose a person to hate Is so vague and it doesn't have to be proven.
[01:03:11.835 --> 01:03:13.877]  It doesn't have to actually expose a person to hate.
[01:03:13.897 --> 01:03:17.020]  It's just a could be maybe in the future tense crime.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.262]  I saw you were playing a clip there from Minority Report.
[01:03:19.282 --> 01:03:20.643]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:03:20.943 --> 01:03:24.126]  So take my fellow Canadian Jordan Peterson.
[01:03:24.527 --> 01:03:26.088]  He talks about transgenderism.
[01:03:26.128 --> 01:03:29.732]  He talks about other things in a really deep way and it gets people riled up.
[01:03:30.771 --> 01:03:32.352]  He posts a lot on social media.
[01:03:32.893 --> 01:03:40.860]  So any post he's ever made new or anything that's still online that he has control over could be the subject of a complaint.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:48.446]  And one of the ways people can complain is to a political quasi-judicial tribunal, not real judges.
[01:03:48.466 --> 01:03:50.308]  It's run by activists.
[01:03:50.788 --> 01:03:52.750]  It's called the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.
[01:03:54.281 --> 01:03:56.583]  Anyone in the country can complain.
[01:03:56.683 --> 01:03:58.324]  Actually, they don't even have to be a citizen.
[01:03:58.945 --> 01:04:01.146]  Anyone can complain to the Human Rights Commission.
[01:04:01.366 --> 01:04:02.507]  They don't have to hire a lawyer.
[01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:03.748]  They just have to file a complaint.
[01:04:03.768 --> 01:04:07.531]  It would be as easy as making a YouTube comment or a Twitter comment.
[01:04:07.991 --> 01:04:10.453]  But they do it instead of just shouting in Twitter.
[01:04:10.894 --> 01:04:13.295]  They file it with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.
[01:04:13.756 --> 01:04:16.438]  The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has a hearing.
[01:04:17.619 --> 01:04:38.290]   And if Jordan Peterson wins, You still have to hire a lawyer and waste his time, but if he loses, which he would, because he publishes things likely to expose a person to hatred or contempt, he has to pay the complainant $20,000 per complaint, and he has to pay a fine to the government of $50,000.
[01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:41.231]  And these are unlimited.
[01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:52.095]  You could have hundreds, you could have thousands, you could have every single tweet he's ever done, every single video he's ever done, theoretically, could be found against him.
[01:04:53.077 --> 01:05:01.387]  And the crazy part, this is where we're into the Star Chamber stuff, the identity of the complainant can be kept secret.
[01:05:02.313 --> 01:05:04.554]  So you don't know who's complained against you.
[01:05:04.935 --> 01:05:07.696]  You don't know who has furnished the evidence against you.
[01:05:08.177 --> 01:05:09.878]  It could be someone with a grudge.
[01:05:09.898 --> 01:05:11.719]  It could be an ex-employee.
[01:05:11.759 --> 01:05:14.040]  It could be an ex-wife or ex-girlfriend.
[01:05:14.301 --> 01:05:15.281]  It could be a rival.
[01:05:15.301 --> 01:05:16.162]  It could be a lawyer.
[01:05:16.182 --> 01:05:17.463]  It could be anyone.
[01:05:17.583 --> 01:05:21.205]  You don't have the right to know the identity of your accuser.
[01:05:21.925 --> 01:05:24.747]  And like I say, you don't even have to be a victim.
[01:05:24.767 --> 01:05:26.088]  You don't have to be involved at all.
[01:05:26.903 --> 01:05:29.244]  Because remember what the offense is.
[01:05:29.724 --> 01:05:31.224]  Not that you actually harmed someone.
[01:05:31.625 --> 01:05:35.286]  Not that you actually, you know, punched someone or stole something.
[01:05:35.306 --> 01:05:36.106]  Nothing measurable.
[01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:40.388]  Just likely to expose a person to feelings.
[01:05:41.028 --> 01:05:44.409]  So there is, these are literally victimless non-crimes.
[01:05:45.091 --> 01:05:53.564]  But as long as you can prove to this hunter-killer human rights tribunal that it was likely to cause hard feelings, you've got yourself $20,000.
[01:05:54.084 --> 01:06:04.934]   So what you've done is you've mobilized every single online Complainer who says, I hate InfoWars, or I hate Rebel News, or I hate Jordan Peterson.
[01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:07.376]  Now they don't just bitch online.
[01:06:07.956 --> 01:06:15.862]  Now they can complain to a government agency which can summon Jordan Peterson, put him through the process, and tag him 20 grand a pop.
[01:06:16.323 --> 01:06:22.007]  It's actually weaponizing the judiciary in a manner, like Donald Trump's a spectacular case.
[01:06:23.088 --> 01:06:24.269]  Absolutely spectacular.
[01:06:24.649 --> 01:06:26.831]  Huge prosecutions by attorneys general.
[01:06:27.532 --> 01:06:44.707]  This is in some ways worse, because it conscripts an entire troll army of woke leftists to stop tweeting for free and start writing to the Human Rights Tribunal and say, hey, that video by Jordan Peterson was likely to cause hate towards me or towards someone.
[01:06:45.448 --> 01:06:46.569]  Have a hearing.
[01:06:46.909 --> 01:06:49.311]  This will be unlimited and endless.
[01:06:49.592 --> 01:07:05.381]   And what I've just described is the lightest touch, because this law Also deals with the criminal code in Canada, and it contains a new stand-alone hate crime, punishable by life in prison.
[01:07:05.722 --> 01:07:09.906]  I should tell you, Canada is so liberal, no one spends life in prison!
[01:07:10.167 --> 01:07:10.988]  No one does!
[01:07:11.644 --> 01:07:17.870]  But for hate crimes, this new bill creates a life-in-prison sentence for hate criminals.
[01:07:18.151 --> 01:07:18.771]  That's a fact.
[01:07:18.891 --> 01:07:21.854]  Alright, I want you to go into the weeds of this bill.
[01:07:22.094 --> 01:07:27.540]  This is so Ornwellian, you almost, again, you almost can't even believe it, folks, but he's about to get into the bill.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.661]  But, you know, here's what's crazy.
[01:07:29.001 --> 01:07:32.024]  The two things I'll say, and then I want you to just lay into all of this.
[01:07:32.825 --> 01:07:41.708]  When individual, if you saw the stories out there that said, Alex Jones owes Sandy Hook family's trillions of dollars or whatever, and you said, well wait, how is that possible?
[01:07:42.248 --> 01:07:47.190]  That's the same precedent that they used to reach that conclusion.
[01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:53.332]  They said, okay, well, if Jones owes, I don't know, it was like $4.5 million for this full statement.
[01:07:53.753 --> 01:08:02.535]   They said, okay, well now every tweet or every statement he's ever made times $4.5 million And so that's 3.6 trillion.
[01:08:02.656 --> 01:08:04.476]  And so that's how they reached that ludicrous number.
[01:08:04.496 --> 01:08:05.476]  It was the same precedent.
[01:08:05.716 --> 01:08:09.577]  But imagine, again, it's like, where is the logical conclusion in any of this?
[01:08:10.017 --> 01:08:16.119]  So, basically what this bill would say, and Ezra Levant, my guest, is about to get into the weeds of this.
[01:08:16.799 --> 01:08:27.501]   If I go on air, and let's say there's somebody down the street here, and they are engaged in some of the most heinous crimes, They rape and kill an infant.
[01:08:28.022 --> 01:08:35.028]  Well, if I go on air and I say, X and so down the street rape and kill an infant, well, is that not in violation of this bill?
[01:08:35.388 --> 01:08:42.135]  Would that not might cause somebody to hate or be upset at an individual because they raped and killed an infant?
[01:08:43.308 --> 01:08:45.210]  I mean, that's how insane this is.
[01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:52.876]  So this is completely shattering, not just free speech, this is just shattering thought and speech.
[01:08:53.256 --> 01:08:55.458]  So Ezra, get into now the weeds of this.
[01:08:56.478 --> 01:08:56.699]  Sure.
[01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:57.779]  And I'd go further.
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:08:59.681]  It's a feelings crime.
[01:09:00.121 --> 01:09:03.424]  And by the way, let me just talk for one more minute about the feeling called hate.
[01:09:04.004 --> 01:09:05.365]  We don't like to be hateful.
[01:09:05.385 --> 01:09:07.427]  We don't like to see hate in others.
[01:09:07.507 --> 01:09:08.728]  It's sort of an ugly emotion.
[01:09:09.696 --> 01:09:16.221]  But if you ask people why they hate something, they usually, if they're telling the truth, say there's an underlying grievance of some sort.
[01:09:16.581 --> 01:09:18.322]  They're angry about something.
[01:09:18.603 --> 01:09:20.404]  They feel something was done wrong.
[01:09:20.784 --> 01:09:23.827]  So if you want to deal with hate, deal with the underlying grievance.
[01:09:24.227 --> 01:09:28.290]  Simply telling someone who has hard feelings, you're not allowed to feel that way.
[01:09:29.013 --> 01:09:31.414]  That's not going to make them change their mind.
[01:09:31.435 --> 01:09:33.776]  Like I said, you can't force someone to love each other.
[01:09:34.216 --> 01:09:37.058]  But frankly, speech is a safety valve.
[01:09:37.078 --> 01:09:39.259]  People can blow off steam with free speech.
[01:09:39.559 --> 01:09:45.303]  Because I tell you, there's a correlation between countries where you're allowed to blow off steam with the First Amendment...
[01:09:46.164 --> 01:09:52.789]  And peace versus countries where you're not allowed peaceful criticism of the world and so people resort to violence.
[01:09:53.009 --> 01:10:05.558]  But let me... I talked about this Human Rights Tribunal that's basically putting a $20,000 bounty on each complaint that you can bring before them and it gives people secrecy to make the complaints.
[01:10:05.859 --> 01:10:11.263]  That's insane and I think that's how they're gonna go after conservatives like me or Jordan Peterson.
[01:10:11.523 --> 01:10:13.785]  But let me tell you something even darker.
[01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:19.022]  And I think this is going to give you some January 6 vibes.
[01:10:20.442 --> 01:10:22.063]  You know what a restraining order is?
[01:10:22.123 --> 01:10:24.783]  They're often used in a domestic dispute.
[01:10:25.464 --> 01:10:27.865]  Let's say, God forbid, a man is beating his wife.
[01:10:27.945 --> 01:10:35.007]  She can go to court and get a restraining order, which is basically an order that he's not allowed to come within a certain number of feet of her, not allowed to call her, etc.
[01:10:35.687 --> 01:10:37.188]  At the end of the day, it's a piece of paper.
[01:10:37.208 --> 01:10:40.969]  You can't stop a fist, but it's basically a warning, stay away.
[01:10:42.108 --> 01:10:46.690]  We use restraining orders when there's a case like I've just described, domestic violence.
[01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:52.712]  But this C-63 creates a restraining order against what?
[01:10:52.812 --> 01:10:53.492]  Against fists?
[01:10:54.113 --> 01:10:54.893]  Against violence?
[01:10:55.513 --> 01:10:55.753]  No.
[01:10:57.074 --> 01:10:59.915]  Against hate speech.
[01:11:01.035 --> 01:11:10.019]  So if someone out there, you think he might engage in hate speech in the future, he hasn't done so yet.
[01:11:11.181 --> 01:11:17.884]  You can go to a judge, and I see your producer there had C-63 in the background.
[01:11:18.165 --> 01:11:22.067]  Search for the phrase, fear of hate, and you'll pull it up if you want to show this.
[01:11:22.367 --> 01:11:27.369]  Because again, this is the part that Scott Adams probably wouldn't believe, and I want to show you in the primary document.
[01:11:27.949 --> 01:11:33.572]  They are adding a crime to the Canadian Criminal Code called, fear of hate.
[01:11:34.633 --> 01:11:36.834]  Fear of hate, propaganda, offense, or hate crime.
[01:11:37.034 --> 01:11:38.955]  And I'm just going to read it to you because it's very short.
[01:11:40.382 --> 01:12:00.958]  The new section 810.0121 of our criminal code will now read, if this bill passes, a person may, with the Attorney General's consent, lay an information before a provincial court judge if the person fears, on reasonable grounds, that another person will commit an offense under section 318 or 319.
[01:12:01.358 --> 01:12:05.382]  And those are the hate speech provisions.
[01:12:07.663 --> 01:12:08.304]  What does this mean?
[01:12:09.278 --> 01:12:11.959]  If you're afraid that someone's going to say something bad.
[01:12:11.999 --> 01:12:12.799]  They haven't done it yet.
[01:12:13.599 --> 01:12:14.900]  They have not done it yet.
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:24.142]  But if you have a fear that someone's going to engage in hate speech or hate propaganda, you can go to a judge and then scroll down a tiny bit there.
[01:12:25.142 --> 01:12:28.303]  The provincial court judge may cause the parties to appear.
[01:12:28.803 --> 01:12:30.083]  And then look at part three.
[01:12:30.484 --> 01:12:31.764]  Yeah, you've got it on the screen there.
[01:12:31.844 --> 01:12:32.184]  Perfect.
[01:12:32.204 --> 01:12:32.624]  Great work.
[01:12:32.664 --> 01:12:33.104]  Thanks, guys.
[01:12:33.144 --> 01:12:35.605]  I want it because you're not going to believe me if you didn't see this with your own eyes.
[01:12:36.454 --> 01:12:52.593]  If the provincial court judge before whom the parties appear is satisfied by the evidence adduced, that the informant has reasonable grounds for the fear, the judge may order that the defendant enter into a recognizance to keep the peace and be of good behavior for a period of not more than 12 months.
[01:12:52.934 --> 01:12:53.915]  Now what does that mean?
[01:12:55.285 --> 01:12:56.786]  Scroll down to subsection six.
[01:12:56.806 --> 01:13:00.229]  It's just a little bit further down called conditions in recognizance.
[01:13:00.490 --> 01:13:02.952]  So I'm using some legal jargon recognizance.
[01:13:02.972 --> 01:13:05.434]  Basically it's it's a it's a peace bond.
[01:13:05.514 --> 01:13:10.819]  It's a restraining order because someone's afraid you're going to say something really mean.
[01:13:10.839 --> 01:13:11.539]  You haven't done it yet.
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:13.661]  But look at section six.
[01:13:13.721 --> 01:13:16.484]  Look at what the judge can do.
[01:13:16.504 --> 01:13:20.507]  A. Wear an electronic monitoring device.
[01:13:20.908 --> 01:13:20.928]  B.
[01:13:22.043 --> 01:13:25.266]  Return to and remain at their place of residence at specified times.
[01:13:25.286 --> 01:13:26.206]  That's called house arrest.
[01:13:26.927 --> 01:13:32.712]  C. Abstain from the consumption of drugs or alcohol.
[01:13:32.732 --> 01:13:38.977]  D. Provide, for the purpose of analysis, a sample of bodily substance that can make you give blood or urine.
[01:13:39.557 --> 01:13:41.819]  E. That's more on blood or urine.
[01:13:42.179 --> 01:13:47.764]  F. Abstain from communicating directly or indirectly with any person.
[01:13:48.476 --> 01:13:56.660]  Identified in the recognizance or refrain from going to any place specified in the recognizance except in accordance with the judge.
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:57.460]  Condition 7.
[01:13:58.121 --> 01:13:59.862]  Seize your lawful firearms.
[01:14:01.462 --> 01:14:04.684]  And by the way, if you don't agree with any of this, you go straight to prison.
[01:14:06.665 --> 01:14:07.926]  It's all there in Bill C-63.
[01:14:08.466 --> 01:14:09.466]  We've gone through the text.
[01:14:09.506 --> 01:14:11.547]  I don't want to get bogged down in there, but let me sum it up.
[01:14:13.528 --> 01:14:14.749]  You didn't have to do anything yet.
[01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:22.736]  It's that Tom Cruise movie, Minority Report, where those pre-cogs, you know that sci-fi movie, those three sort of mind-future predictors?
[01:14:22.776 --> 01:14:23.837]  Yeah, the oracles.
[01:14:24.718 --> 01:14:30.202]  If they predict, hey, he hasn't said anything mean yet, but just take a look at him.
[01:14:30.302 --> 01:14:32.624]  He watches InfoWars, he watches Rebel News.
[01:14:33.144 --> 01:14:36.207]  Judge, I'm really afraid he's going to say something super mean.
[01:14:37.626 --> 01:14:52.197]  Ankle bracelet, house arrest, no alcohol, give up your firearms, you can't call this person, you can't go there, it's in black and white, a restraining order, I believe in restraining orders in the case of domestic violence, or a stalker, absolutely, I think we all do.
[01:14:53.418 --> 01:15:00.824]  That's real harm, that's real violence, you gotta stop it, you wanna have the cops stop it, you wanna have those dangerous offenders locked up, I think we all agree on that.
[01:15:01.417 --> 01:15:13.868]  But they are taking that legal mechanism, that police mechanism, that punishment that we normally use on sex offenders or domestic violence cases, and they're putting it on hate speech.
[01:15:15.429 --> 01:15:20.654]  Maybe we'll just read that part one more time, because I bet you if Scott Adams was watching, he'd be saying, it can't be.
[01:15:20.954 --> 01:15:21.495]  It can't be.
[01:15:21.955 --> 01:15:23.396]  This is for speech.
[01:15:24.618 --> 01:15:28.381]  It's called fear of hate propaganda offense or hate crime.
[01:15:29.241 --> 01:15:31.503]  This is about words, Owen.
[01:15:31.903 --> 01:15:33.064]  This is not just words.
[01:15:33.605 --> 01:15:34.585]  It's about feelings.
[01:15:34.645 --> 01:15:36.127]  Hate is a feeling, Owen.
[01:15:36.927 --> 01:15:44.674]  If someone is afraid you're going to say something that will cause someone else to have hard feelings, a likely to offense.
[01:15:44.974 --> 01:15:46.135]  It doesn't even have to happen.
[01:15:46.535 --> 01:15:49.778]  I'm afraid he's going to say something that might cause someone to have hard feelings.
[01:15:50.338 --> 01:15:52.620]  You can get them locked up.
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:56.003]  That is the coming law in Canada.
[01:15:57.083 --> 01:16:00.464]  Owen, you would understand this more than most.
[01:16:01.525 --> 01:16:05.787]  Well, let's be clear about something before we take this break.
[01:16:06.867 --> 01:16:09.768]  This is going to be applied one-sided.
[01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:14.750]  This is only going to be applied one way, and we all know which way that is.
[01:16:14.810 --> 01:16:20.913]  But I guess, before we get into the next segment, I'll kind of let you chew on this and think about this during the break.
[01:16:20.973 --> 01:16:23.714]  Well, okay, so you ask, well, what do we do to stop this?
[01:16:25.367 --> 01:16:26.527]  Do we try to get ahead of it?
[01:16:26.747 --> 01:16:39.971]  Does Ezra Levant come out and all the people that lie about Ezra Levant and all the people that write negative stories about Ezra Levant and Rebel News and slander you and libel you, do you get ahead of it?
[01:16:40.031 --> 01:16:42.512]  And you say, hey, these people are causing hate against me!
[01:16:43.112 --> 01:16:51.476]  Do you go to the court first and you say, all the people that have called you names, all the people that have lied about you and tried to destroy your character, do you get ahead of this?
[01:16:51.656 --> 01:16:54.757]  And you say, hey, they're going to cause hatred to come to me.
[01:16:54.797 --> 01:16:56.638]  They're putting out speech that's anti-me.
[01:16:56.658 --> 01:16:59.639]  Do you get ahead of this so that they can see how this could be applied both ways?
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:03.401]  Or to prove that it is only one direction?
[01:17:03.421 --> 01:17:06.723]  I'm going to let Ezra chew on that as we go to break.
[01:17:07.663 --> 01:17:10.885]  And we'll rejoin and revisit this issue on the other side.
[01:17:10.925 --> 01:17:14.066]  The InfoWars Show, Alex Jones Show with you.

[01:17:38.212 --> 01:17:39.433]  We said, we want the strongest you can make.

[01:18:14.477 --> 01:18:19.360]  Such important information here with Ezra Levant from Rebel News.
[01:18:20.661 --> 01:18:23.282]  And we can't just assume that this stuff is going to go away.
[01:18:23.803 --> 01:18:36.550]  And so we have to find out some way to stop this speech crime bill, emotion crime bill, from going into place.
[01:18:36.871 --> 01:18:49.181]   And Ezra, as I'm listening to you, there's a lot of things that come to my mind because You hear the terminology, you read this bill and you just think, well, I mean, it's almost comical.
[01:18:49.201 --> 01:18:50.741]  I mean, this is like kindergarten time.
[01:18:51.202 --> 01:18:57.685]  This is like something that you put on the wall of a preschool that says, you know, keep your hands to yourself, be nice to one another.
[01:18:58.105 --> 01:19:03.227]  And it's like that's, you know, because you just want to teach kids just basic proper manners and conduct.
[01:19:03.688 --> 01:19:06.229]  But this is like supposed to be real for adults.
[01:19:06.569 --> 01:19:13.735]   I mean, going through Canadian Parliament and Justin Trudeau, But so that's what makes it so eerie.
[01:19:13.995 --> 01:19:21.200]  And I started the show today because we've got our own eeriness here in America, obviously, where Joe Biden says, we're ending the Second Amendment.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:22.802]  We're going to finish the job.
[01:19:22.822 --> 01:19:24.062]  We're going to take your firearms.
[01:19:24.082 --> 01:19:25.964]  I mean, that sends chills up my spines.
[01:19:26.004 --> 01:19:28.866]  And so you combine that with what you're experiencing in Canada.
[01:19:28.926 --> 01:19:33.189]  And it's just like, whoa, this is really where we're at right now.
[01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:39.815]   So let's get back to where I left you in the last We obviously know the purpose of this is one way, right?
[01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:42.016]  This is left to right.
[01:19:42.076 --> 01:19:43.357]  That's the direction this goes.
[01:19:43.998 --> 01:19:45.539]  So, how do we stop it?
[01:19:45.599 --> 01:19:47.541]  Well, does Ezra Levant get ahead of this?
[01:19:48.041 --> 01:19:51.804]  Does Ezra Levant look at all the people that have lied about him, lied about his news organization?
[01:19:51.844 --> 01:19:52.785]  Does he pull the quotes?
[01:19:52.805 --> 01:19:56.909]  Does he name the individuals and say, hey, all these individuals are causing hate against me.
[01:19:57.289 --> 01:20:01.933]  All these individuals' speech and emotions against me apply to this bill.
[01:20:02.073 --> 01:20:03.774]  I want them shut down.
[01:20:04.295 --> 01:20:05.596]  Is that how we get ahead of this?
[01:20:06.156 --> 01:20:08.498]  Is that how you expose it, to stop it?
[01:20:08.918 --> 01:20:10.199]  What do you think, Ezra Levin?
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:15.382]  Well, I mean, let me give you an answer with an American analogy.
[01:20:15.842 --> 01:20:20.525]  So what they're doing to Trump, they're going after his business deals, they're trying to get him off the ballot.
[01:20:21.806 --> 01:20:34.596]   Those only work because I think the deciders, or the prosecutors, or the grand juries, or whatever the terminology is, They are woke, they hate Trump, they are left-wing, and they're brutal.
[01:20:34.916 --> 01:20:36.917]  They'll do literally anything to win.
[01:20:37.158 --> 01:20:40.040]  They're not governed by rules of fair play.
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:42.362]  They're certainly not governed by the American Constitution.
[01:20:42.402 --> 01:20:47.186]  So, what they're doing to Trump, I suppose someone could say, well, could we do that to Biden, too?
[01:20:47.426 --> 01:20:48.267]  Well, you could try.
[01:20:48.287 --> 01:20:54.993]  I mean, actually, there's a lot of fodder with Biden's, quote, business deals with foreign entities and payments.
[01:20:55.433 --> 01:20:58.435]  But you're not going to find woke judges who would allow it.
[01:20:58.515 --> 01:21:01.416]  And you're not going to find conservative judges who would go there.
[01:21:01.816 --> 01:21:03.757]  So it's actually a one-way fight.
[01:21:03.797 --> 01:21:05.238]  Let me give you a Canadian analogy.
[01:21:05.258 --> 01:21:06.318]  It's not even an analogy.
[01:21:06.338 --> 01:21:07.619]  Let me just tell you how it is in Canada.
[01:21:08.217 --> 01:21:13.878]  Justin Trudeau hand-picks the members of the so-called Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.
[01:21:14.078 --> 01:21:15.379]  They're not appointed for life.
[01:21:15.759 --> 01:21:23.081]  They're appointed for a short period of time, and so they want to ingratiate themselves with Trudeau by giving him the answers he wants.
[01:21:23.281 --> 01:21:25.261]  They're activists, they're not real judges.
[01:21:25.801 --> 01:21:38.247]   So, if I were to go before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal and say, well, Justin Trudeau has fomented hatred against me, for example, During the lockdowns, Trudeau really demonized unvaccinated people.
[01:21:38.607 --> 01:21:41.410]  He basically said they shouldn't have the same rights as other people.
[01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:43.451]  He set up a no-fly list.
[01:21:43.812 --> 01:21:49.596]  If you were not jabbed, you were not allowed on an airplane or a train in Canada, the second largest country in the world.
[01:21:49.997 --> 01:21:52.839]  Trudeau hates the unvaccinated.
[01:21:52.939 --> 01:21:54.540]  He hates Christians.
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:55.301]  He's very clear.
[01:21:56.302 --> 01:22:06.170]   But if you were to try and go to the Human Rights Tribunal and say, he's discriminating against me because of hate speech, because of my religion, They'd laugh you out of there because they're all woke activists just like him.
[01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:12.494]  And by the way, Trudeau, you remember there was a while there where the U.S.
[01:22:12.514 --> 01:22:19.779]  was thinking of having an Internet Safety Commissioner, some very odd gal who sort of blew herself up.
[01:22:20.219 --> 01:22:21.901]  Yes, she was a strange creature.
[01:22:21.921 --> 01:22:23.141]  She was in and out real fast.
[01:22:25.603 --> 01:22:33.689]   Let me just read to you from the summary of the law, this law, quote, Establishes the Digital Safety Commission of Canada.
[01:22:34.411 --> 01:22:38.239]  Creates the position of the Digital Safety Ombudsperson of Canada.
[01:22:39.409 --> 01:22:42.710]  And establishes the Digital Safety Office of Canada.
[01:22:42.890 --> 01:22:44.091]  Those are three different things.
[01:22:44.431 --> 01:22:49.573]  So you just had one goofy gal who was going to be the Commissioner for Internet Safety.
[01:22:49.993 --> 01:23:04.439]  Trudeau is setting up three new agencies, three new offices, each one of them with a staff, each one of them with a budget, each one of them with hunter-killer lawyers and bureaucrats, and he's only picking people who believe in his agenda.
[01:23:05.539 --> 01:23:07.140]  I want to read you just one more thing.
[01:23:08.584 --> 01:23:12.005]  That's about the Digital Safety Ombudsperson.
[01:23:13.206 --> 01:23:22.829]  This person will have access to, sorry there's so many different, sorry the Digital Safety Commission.
[01:23:23.644 --> 01:23:31.070]  Can get access to inside information from any social media company Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, etc.
[01:23:31.691 --> 01:23:42.560]  As an advocate can poke around inside private information in those companies and then can use that information as advocacy against hate.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:54.240]   So this is basically a way of getting into Elon Musk's Private stuff, and using it to re-weaponize Twitter against Trudeau's enemies.
[01:23:54.701 --> 01:23:58.062]  I just want to throw one more thing at you because we're talking about big tech companies.
[01:23:58.902 --> 01:24:06.865]  There's this crazy line, and if you've got the law open on your screen, just do a find and search for the word 8%.
[01:24:06.905 --> 01:24:10.806]  Oh, there was one thing I didn't mention to you.
[01:24:10.846 --> 01:24:12.027]  Sorry, I'm jumping all over the place.
[01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:13.167]  There's so many things I want to tell you.
[01:24:13.587 --> 01:24:15.428]  Oh, and let me just close on this.
[01:24:17.591 --> 01:24:25.114]  If there is some, quote, hateful comment online, Trudeau says the companies have to take it down within 24 hours.
[01:24:26.655 --> 01:24:27.375]  Now, how do you do that?
[01:24:27.415 --> 01:24:30.477]  Let's say a complaint is filed at midnight on Friday night.
[01:24:30.937 --> 01:24:33.938]  By the time anyone sort of looks at it, it's Saturday morning.
[01:24:34.639 --> 01:24:39.421]  If you get both sides of the story and try and have like a proper adjudication, you can't do that in 24 hours.
[01:24:39.901 --> 01:24:48.425]   But if these companies do not comply and do not bend the knee to Trudeau's laws, Look at that part that your producer found.
[01:24:48.445 --> 01:24:49.606]  They found it really quickly.
[01:24:50.906 --> 01:25:08.615]  Companies like Facebook, I'm just going to read it, every operator that commits an offense is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine of not more than 8% of the operator's gross global revenue or $25 million, whichever is greater.
[01:25:09.016 --> 01:25:18.907]   So if Facebook, I know this sounds insane, if Facebook doesn't obey, I think Facebook's revenues last year were about $130 billion, just rough numbers.
[01:25:19.708 --> 01:25:22.771]  Trudeau says, I'm going to fine you 8% of your global revenues.
[01:25:22.831 --> 01:25:25.454]  I'm going to fine you $10 billion.
[01:25:26.395 --> 01:25:28.277]  It's like Dr. Evil.
[01:25:28.297 --> 01:25:32.362]  I'm going to fine you $10 billion for not engaging in censorship.
[01:25:32.382 --> 01:25:33.543]  So what's Facebook going to do?
[01:25:34.352 --> 01:25:36.353]  They're going to take everything down!
[01:25:36.773 --> 01:25:45.355]  Now, this law may be illegal under the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement, this law may be illegal in a number of ways, but Trudeau's proposing it, you can see it with your own eyes.
[01:25:45.775 --> 01:26:10.251]   Trudeau is saying to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, although he doesn't seem to mind TikTok, Trudeau is saying, if you don't impose censorship the way I want you to, if you don't give me access to your records the way I want you to, if you don't do what I say, I'm going to fine you 8%, not just of your Canadian revenue, But if you're American revenue, you're European revenue, you're Australian revenue, I'm taking 10 billion dollars as a punishment.
[01:26:11.292 --> 01:26:16.678]  It wouldn't surprise me, by the way, if some of these companies actually leave Canada, which I think Trudeau wouldn't mind.
[01:26:16.698 --> 01:26:26.643]   I don't know if you know this, Owen, but Trudeau said to Facebook, You've got to give money to every news agency that you link to in Canada.
[01:26:26.983 --> 01:26:27.984]  And they're all left-wing.
[01:26:28.344 --> 01:26:31.246]  And Facebook says, you know, that's not how the Internet works.
[01:26:31.666 --> 01:26:34.288]  People like when we link to them because we give them traffic.
[01:26:34.328 --> 01:26:35.308]  We don't pay for links.
[01:26:35.328 --> 01:26:36.649]  That's not how the Internet works.
[01:26:37.170 --> 01:26:38.591]  Trudeau said, you have to.
[01:26:39.091 --> 01:26:42.633]  You're going to have to pay $100 million a year to all these media companies.
[01:26:42.693 --> 01:26:43.634]  And you know what Facebook did?
[01:26:44.850 --> 01:26:47.951]  Facebook turned off the news in Canada.
[01:26:48.331 --> 01:26:52.973]  You cannot post a link on Facebook to a news source in Canada.
[01:26:53.253 --> 01:26:54.994]  It's like the Great Firewall of China.
[01:26:55.234 --> 01:27:01.156]  That's crazy that the news organizations wouldn't push back against that because that's harmful to them as well.
[01:27:01.236 --> 01:27:02.296]  Well, they wanted the money!
[01:27:02.716 --> 01:27:04.097]  Google agreed to pay it!
[01:27:04.637 --> 01:27:07.359]  Google actually agreed to pay a hundred million bucks a year.
[01:27:07.419 --> 01:27:07.960]  This is crazy.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.060]  But Facebook said we're out of here.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.361]  All right, we're up against a break.
[01:27:10.421 --> 01:27:11.022]  Hold that thought.
[01:27:11.042 --> 01:27:11.922]  We're up against a break.
[01:27:12.383 --> 01:27:15.565]  I'm not surprised Trudeau wouldn't go against TikTok.
[01:27:15.625 --> 01:27:17.446]  It's owned by the Chinese, which he seems to love.
[01:27:17.706 --> 01:27:19.908]  But you know, I want to get into something else in the next segment.
[01:27:20.308 --> 01:27:22.510]  You know, Trudeau puts on this fairy act.
[01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:23.931]  He dances around like a Nancy.
[01:27:24.851 --> 01:27:29.292]  Folks, Justin Trudeau is a hardcore bigot and dictator.
[01:27:29.612 --> 01:27:32.773]  Do not be fooled by this Nancy boy prancing around.
[01:27:33.193 --> 01:27:39.875]  This is such important information being covered by Ezra Levant here from Rebel News on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:40.475 --> 01:27:46.596]  And I hope that you take these clips, I hope that you take this segment and spread it far and wide.
[01:27:46.676 --> 01:27:49.437]  We need to be locking arms with our neighbors to the north.
[01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:53.412]  to fight for freedom in the West.
[01:27:53.892 --> 01:28:00.177]  Now, it's funny, because I'm going to ask Ezra a question.
[01:28:00.197 --> 01:28:05.641]  I already know the answer, but the implications are rather serious yet comical.
[01:28:06.241 --> 01:28:10.965]  But you brought something up in the first segment when we were talking, Ezra.
[01:28:10.985 --> 01:28:21.989]   You were talking about how this bill The idea or the notion that somehow this is going to aim to eradicate hate and that that is obviously impossible.
[01:28:22.469 --> 01:28:26.130]  Well, there was a film that came out called Equilibrium.
[01:28:27.171 --> 01:28:31.552]  And in that film, they did discover a way in their view to eradicate hate.
[01:28:31.592 --> 01:28:37.334]  And that was, of course, via chemical castration, where you had to take injections.
[01:28:37.354 --> 01:28:39.855]  The government mandates you take injections.
[01:28:39.875 --> 01:28:41.436]  It was like five times a day or whatever.
[01:28:42.176 --> 01:28:45.277]  And that was how they, quote-unquote, eradicated hate.
[01:28:45.597 --> 01:28:52.139]  Now, that seems like a science fiction dystopian film, but yet here we are.
[01:28:52.179 --> 01:28:56.900]  They just forced people to take the COVID-19 vaccines, an experimental vaccine.
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:28:58.981]  Now they're writing bills to eradicate hate.
[01:28:59.021 --> 01:29:00.481]  Well, you combine the two, what do you get?
[01:29:00.561 --> 01:29:04.723]  You get the science fiction dystopian film Equilibrium.
[01:29:05.583 --> 01:29:17.505]   Now, I said that Justin Trudeau's act like he's some sort of a Nancy Ferry boy is just that and he's really a hardcore bigot and tyrant.
[01:29:18.485 --> 01:29:23.628]  Ezra Levant, did I just commit a crime according to this new proposed legislation in Canada?
[01:29:25.088 --> 01:29:25.589]  You did.
[01:29:26.129 --> 01:29:30.631]  And because there was a slight sexual innuendo to it.
[01:29:31.289 --> 01:29:35.970]  And there's three different ways you would be hit with a hate speech offense.
[01:29:36.930 --> 01:29:40.071]  Well, usually when Trudeau talks about three ways, it's something else, but that's another story.
[01:29:41.612 --> 01:29:51.194]  I mean, criticizing sexual orientation is against the law, criticizing gender identity, and criticizing gender expression.
[01:29:51.674 --> 01:29:55.215]  All three of those are prohibited grounds in the law.
[01:29:55.835 --> 01:30:01.064]  So, I was giving the example earlier of Jordan Peterson, because he takes on the transgender issue.
[01:30:02.285 --> 01:30:07.333]  But even a news report, because remember, it doesn't have to be false to be hateful.
[01:30:07.413 --> 01:30:10.057]  In fact, sometimes the truth is odious.
[01:30:10.943 --> 01:30:14.427]  Sometimes people don't want to know the truth because it causes them hard feelings.
[01:30:14.987 --> 01:30:26.840]  So, in Canada and the United States and other Western countries, there is a phenomenon right now, of course, of transgender, male-to-female transgender athletes who play against girls.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:31.825]  And in Canada, there's a case of such an athlete playing against teenagers.
[01:30:33.136 --> 01:30:40.822]  Young girls, like 13-year-old girls, 50-year-old guy who's a transgender athlete who not just competes against women, competes against young girls.
[01:30:41.262 --> 01:30:54.652]  And if you talk about this in a way that even if it's completely true what you say, if it could likely to expose a person to hatred, that's against the law.
[01:30:54.672 --> 01:31:05.296]   So if what you did there, Owen, is likely to expose Justin Trudeau to hatred, Based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, you've just committed an offense in Canada.
[01:31:06.457 --> 01:31:07.958]  Now, who's going to prosecute that?
[01:31:08.939 --> 01:31:09.960]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:11.241]  You don't need a prosecutor anymore.
[01:31:11.521 --> 01:31:14.343]  Any person can file a complaint against you.
[01:31:14.784 --> 01:31:21.390]  Now, you're likely beyond the reach of Canadian law, but theoretically, your website could be banned.
[01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:23.972]  I don't know if your producers have... I guess I should never go to Canada then.
[01:31:25.091 --> 01:31:29.632]  Well, you know, it's getting more dangerous for freedom up here.
[01:31:29.672 --> 01:31:37.633]  I don't know if your team has it, but I sent a clip, I think we sent a clip over, of the former minister who actually put the bones of this law together.
[01:31:37.893 --> 01:31:39.033]  His name's Stephen Gilboa.
[01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:41.634]  And if you guys don't have it handy, don't worry about it.
[01:31:42.114 --> 01:31:46.695]  But he was asked, so that's the new justice minister on screen who implemented it.
[01:31:47.495 --> 01:31:57.520]   But we have it, I don't know if you guys have it, but the old heritage minister who drafted the law, He said that they reserved for themselves the nuclear option.
[01:31:57.580 --> 01:31:58.200]  What does that mean?
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:03.945]  He was talking about making it impossible to access a website anywhere in the country.
[01:32:03.965 --> 01:32:05.546]  If you guys don't have that clip, don't worry about it.
[01:32:05.566 --> 01:32:06.426]  It's just what I said.
[01:32:07.027 --> 01:32:10.229]  So, he was asked, well, what happens if a website is not compliant?
[01:32:10.549 --> 01:32:14.132]  What happens if someone just doesn't stop saying these bad words?
[01:32:14.492 --> 01:32:15.793]  And he answered plainly.
[01:32:15.853 --> 01:32:17.795]  He said, he called it the nuclear option.
[01:32:18.453 --> 01:32:23.856]  And he said they'll just block an entire website like China does in the Great Firewall of China.
[01:32:23.876 --> 01:32:33.942]  When I was in China some years ago, I would type in different websites to see if I could get access to them and to see what was blocked or not by the Great Firewall of China.
[01:32:34.522 --> 01:32:40.426]  Canada would copy that by literally blocking, I would imagine, InfoWars.com.
[01:32:40.446 --> 01:32:43.468]  It wouldn't surprise me if that happens within the next couple of years.
[01:32:46.576 --> 01:32:47.656]  We're going down that road.
[01:32:47.776 --> 01:32:50.937]  Facebook has already been half-banned in Canada.
[01:32:50.997 --> 01:32:55.079]  Facebook cannot publish Canadian news unless it forks over $100 million.
[01:32:55.399 --> 01:32:56.119]  So they're out of here.
[01:32:57.019 --> 01:33:05.622]  It wouldn't surprise me if this bill passes and if Trudeau maintains in power, if five years from now there are only two kinds of journalism left in Canada.
[01:33:06.763 --> 01:33:10.607]   Government journalism And banned journalism.
[01:33:11.007 --> 01:33:13.169]  They've tried to ban Rebel News several times before.
[01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:18.714]  We've had to go to federal court in emergency applications to overcome Trudeau's censorship.
[01:33:19.355 --> 01:33:32.801]  But we've never had to fight three new agencies, lifetime bans, house arrest, the ability for a social media company to knock us off in a 24-hour panic decision or face billions in fines.
[01:33:32.821 --> 01:33:35.182]  I mean, we're talking about bodily autonomy here!
[01:33:35.202 --> 01:33:37.423]  They want to be able to just come in and take your blood!
[01:33:38.024 --> 01:33:39.384]  You said something we don't like!
[01:33:39.484 --> 01:33:40.365]  Your blood is ours!
[01:33:41.954 --> 01:33:50.981]  That's literally, I'm glad we looked at that, because you would think, what on earth does a blood sample and a urine sample have to do with a restraining order against hate speech?
[01:33:51.482 --> 01:33:54.224]  It's got nothing to do with it, it's just because they can!
[01:33:54.865 --> 01:33:56.426]  And by the way, they do that to me!
[01:33:56.446 --> 01:34:00.289]  I get subjected to annual drug tests.
[01:34:01.069 --> 01:34:01.970]  No drug offenses!
[01:34:03.191 --> 01:34:03.551]  Really?
[01:34:03.571 --> 01:34:04.092]  Yeah!
[01:34:05.153 --> 01:34:09.356]  Well, you know, Justin Trudeau, he's a strange character.
[01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:13.172]  But one of the things you can tell is what he cares about.
[01:34:13.773 --> 01:34:21.840]  Because he has, in the last two years, he has pushed through three different laws about censoring the Internet.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:30.647]  He doesn't have three laws about dealing with inflation, or three laws dealing with crime, or three laws dealing with the carbon tax, or three laws dealing with foreign affairs.
[01:34:30.727 --> 01:34:30.928]  No!
[01:34:31.548 --> 01:34:37.361]   The thing he is obsessed with, the thing that he's throwing all his Energy behind is internet censorship.
[01:34:37.381 --> 01:34:39.783]  Here's a detail for you that you might find weird.
[01:34:40.464 --> 01:34:45.047]  You call it, you know, your Attorney General, we call it the Minister of Justice, same thing.
[01:34:45.788 --> 01:34:50.151]  But he just had his title, his official title was changed.
[01:34:50.211 --> 01:34:58.257]  The title of our Attorney General is now Minister of Justice, Attorney General, and Minister of State for Online Harms.
[01:34:58.337 --> 01:35:01.640]  That's what this new censorship bill is called, Online Harms.
[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:02.781]  What does that mean, Owen?
[01:35:03.416 --> 01:35:07.520]  There are hundreds of laws in Canada that the Justice Minister is in charge of.
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:07.920]  Hundreds!
[01:35:08.521 --> 01:35:12.484]  The Criminal Code itself, which in Canada is federal, has hundreds of sections.
[01:35:13.004 --> 01:35:16.988]  There are literally thousands of things the Justice Minister is in charge of.
[01:35:18.263 --> 01:35:24.848]  But he has his new title, Justice Minister and Minister for Online Harms.
[01:35:25.148 --> 01:35:29.791]  Censorship is now in his official job description, Owen!
[01:35:30.131 --> 01:35:33.574]  It is the most important thing to Justin Trudeau.
[01:35:33.654 --> 01:35:35.255]  More bills than anything else.
[01:35:35.755 --> 01:35:36.476]  More punishment.
[01:35:36.496 --> 01:35:38.997]  There's no life in jail in Canada for anything.
[01:35:39.258 --> 01:35:40.659]  Now there is for hate speech.
[01:35:41.019 --> 01:35:44.001]  And it is now the official name of the Justice Minister.
[01:35:44.461 --> 01:35:46.122]  Tell me he's not serious, Owen.
[01:35:46.162 --> 01:35:46.962]  I know that he is.
[01:35:47.002 --> 01:35:47.563]  Well, think about it.
[01:35:47.663 --> 01:35:50.624]  It all goes back to what you said in the opening statement.
[01:35:51.685 --> 01:35:53.525]  DARVO.
[01:35:53.966 --> 01:35:55.746]  They invert everything.
[01:35:55.887 --> 01:35:57.047]  Everything is inversion.
[01:35:57.247 --> 01:36:00.749]  And then they claim that you're guilty of exactly what they're doing.
[01:36:02.065 --> 01:36:08.268]  If any harm is ever done online, it's the lies that get told about conservatives.
[01:36:08.748 --> 01:36:10.969]  It's the lies that get told about patriots.
[01:36:10.989 --> 01:36:12.429]  I mean, I can go on and on down this list.
[01:36:12.469 --> 01:36:14.030]  Everybody understands exactly what I'm talking about.
[01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.550]  So what do they do?
[01:36:14.850 --> 01:36:18.272]  They invert that, and they say, oh, we're the ones being harmed.
[01:36:18.452 --> 01:36:19.532]  I mean, they do the same thing.
[01:36:19.832 --> 01:36:24.995]  Donald Trump committed fraud when he said Mar-a-Lago was worth $100 million, and then they commit fraud and say it's worth $18.
[01:36:26.328 --> 01:36:31.572]  They just came out in New York and said, these beef companies are committing fraud, talking about carbon emissions.
[01:36:31.772 --> 01:36:35.514]  They're the ones committing fraud, lying about climate change and carbon emissions.
[01:36:35.774 --> 01:36:37.435]  So it's always inversion.
[01:36:37.476 --> 01:36:41.178]  It's always whatever they're doing, they accuse you of doing.
[01:36:41.618 --> 01:36:43.440]  This is just incredible information, folks.
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:48.463]  Again, I encourage you to take these clips, take these segments, and spread them far and wide.
[01:36:49.143 --> 01:36:52.826]  And Ezra, for the last 60 seconds here, a closing statement.
[01:36:54.522 --> 01:37:00.966]  Well, look, Rebel News, we're hardwired to be free speech activists because we're conservatives in a left-wing country.
[01:37:02.046 --> 01:37:06.369]  We've set up a petition at stopthecensorship.ca.
[01:37:06.469 --> 01:37:09.211]  CA is the Canadian internet suffix.
[01:37:09.571 --> 01:37:11.992]  We've already got over 60,000 names there.
[01:37:12.673 --> 01:37:16.115]  I want to demonstrate to Canadians that censorship is not actually our way.
[01:37:16.675 --> 01:37:22.808]   And when this bill becomes a law, and I'm afraid it will, We're going to fight it in court, as we do so often.
[01:37:23.428 --> 01:37:32.531]  Owen, I feel like I've got to be, like a lot of people leave Canada because it's economically becoming a basket case, because of the lockdowns during the pandemic, and because of the lack of freedom.
[01:37:33.111 --> 01:37:36.252]  I feel like we have a duty to be like the captain on the ship.
[01:37:36.292 --> 01:37:37.933]  We've got to be here till the last minute.
[01:37:38.493 --> 01:37:45.635]  I swear to you and your viewers on the altar of God that I will fight for freedom of speech with every ounce of my energy.
[01:37:45.735 --> 01:37:48.096]  This is the final battle for us.
[01:37:48.176 --> 01:37:50.589]   This is The only battle that counts.
[01:37:51.050 --> 01:37:51.930]  Someone's got to do it.
[01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:54.951]  It looks like Ezra Levant is the man taking the stand.
[01:37:55.511 --> 01:37:56.351]  Ezra, thank you so much.
[01:37:59.052 --> 01:38:01.993]  People ask me all the time, why do your supplements work so well?
[01:38:02.574 --> 01:38:06.675]  Because we go out and find out what's already the best sellers nationwide and worldwide.
[01:38:06.995 --> 01:38:11.997]  Then we go to the top companies to produce them and we private label already existing best selling products.
[01:38:12.317 --> 01:38:15.378]  And in most cases, we ask them to make it even stronger.
[01:38:15.858 --> 01:38:17.979]  Even better, because we want it to work for you.
[01:38:18.239 --> 01:38:19.059]  We want you to love it.
[01:38:19.079 --> 01:38:20.479]  We want you to come back and get more of it.
[01:38:20.899 --> 01:38:22.420]  We treat you like we want to be treated.
[01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:23.760]  Plus, that's just good business.
[01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:29.061]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you we have the strongest turmeric formula out there, bar none.
[01:38:29.401 --> 01:38:38.303]  We went to multiple top suppliers in the country about five years ago now and said, what is the strongest cuminoid or concentrate of turmeric you put out?
[01:38:38.723 --> 01:38:40.844]  They said it's 75-85%, but most people only go with 5%.
[01:38:40.964 --> 01:38:41.304]  That's raw.
[01:38:42.884 --> 01:38:48.963]   turmeric. We said what's the strongest you can do? 95%. We have the strongest turmeric on the market
[01:38:48.963 --> 01:38:54.403]   at 95% with a bunch of other natural ingredients that supercharge it for your inflammation, for

[01:39:02.083 --> 01:39:08.251]  It's BODY'S Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% Curcuminoid Extract.

[01:39:10.714 --> 01:39:13.958]  Ladies and gentlemen, BODY'S is an incredible product.
[01:39:14.418 --> 01:39:17.322]  And when you get it, it funds the InfoWars, which is a 360 win.

[01:39:52.631 --> 01:40:00.271]   You know one of the things Ezra mentioned and I didn't really have the time to get into
[01:40:00.271 --> 01:40:08.190]   it was this transgender phenomenon where you have, it's grown men, grown men competing
[01:40:08.190 --> 01:40:13.231]   against young women in sports and that's, that's, you know, that's, that's LGBTQ+.
[01:40:13.229 --> 01:40:14.190]  If you don't like it, you're a bigot.
[01:40:14.971 --> 01:40:16.413]  And there's some other examples of this.
[01:40:18.752 --> 01:40:20.293]  And if you stand up to it, you're the bad guy.
[01:40:20.813 --> 01:40:26.516]  Oh yeah, if you don't want your girl getting smashed by a dude, I mean, physically smashed.
[01:40:26.556 --> 01:40:28.537]  I mean, literally, girls have had broken skulls.
[01:40:28.658 --> 01:40:33.900]  One dude sent three girls to the hospital during a basketball game, so the coach said, okay, we're throwing the white flag, we're done.
[01:40:34.081 --> 01:40:37.202]  Enough girls sent to the hospital by this gigantic man playing against girls.
[01:40:38.763 --> 01:40:43.806]  Coach at Christian School banned after team refused a game against opponent with trans player, defends decision.
[01:40:43.846 --> 01:40:46.367]  So he's the bad guy because he's trying to protect girls.
[01:40:46.688 --> 01:40:47.308]  Where are the feminists?
[01:40:48.902 --> 01:40:52.647]  But that's like barely scratching the surface of this cult.
[01:40:53.780 --> 01:41:00.881]  Fat-haired blue teacher dances sexually with students in new video, and the video is at InfoWars.com.
[01:41:00.901 --> 01:41:03.742]  But folks, again, listen how deranged this is.
[01:41:03.862 --> 01:41:07.262]  This is an undercover phone call.
[01:41:08.123 --> 01:41:09.143]  Libs of TikTok shared this.
[01:41:09.623 --> 01:41:19.365]  LGBTQ youth advocacy organization Trans Youth Equality offers to secretly send 13-year-old a chest binder and to keep it secret from her parents.
[01:41:20.545 --> 01:41:21.785]  What kind of person does that?
[01:41:23.144 --> 01:41:24.785]  A pedophile?
[01:41:24.946 --> 01:41:25.766]  A child abuser?
[01:41:25.786 --> 01:41:26.407]  A predator?
[01:41:26.427 --> 01:41:29.109]  That's what they are!
[01:41:29.589 --> 01:41:38.256]  And they're protecting themselves with the LGBTQ plus flag and they're using gay people as a wall and a hedge of protection against their predatory behavior.
[01:41:38.456 --> 01:41:40.518]  Here's the leaked audio in clip 5.
[01:41:45.362 --> 01:41:46.423]  Trans equality.
[01:41:46.723 --> 01:41:47.964]  Trans youth equality.
[01:41:48.084 --> 01:41:52.226]  I mean, even that name in itself should send us a million red flags.
[01:41:52.406 --> 01:41:56.689]  Hi, do you guys offer gender-affirming care for youth?
[01:41:56.989 --> 01:42:01.471]  We offer support and resources to find gender-affirming care.
[01:42:01.491 --> 01:42:02.372]  We're not a clinic.
[01:42:04.533 --> 01:42:09.156]  And so we do our best to, you know, help parents navigate a little.
[01:42:09.936 --> 01:42:11.057]  What state are you in?
[01:42:11.857 --> 01:42:12.598]  I live in Tennessee.
[01:42:13.938 --> 01:42:16.320]  Oh yes, far.
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:22.743]  So for you, your child would have to go out of state, correct?
[01:42:23.484 --> 01:42:24.924]  Well, I'm actually the child.
[01:42:25.104 --> 01:42:25.285]  I'm 13.
[01:42:25.505 --> 01:42:26.125]  Oh, hi!
[01:42:26.545 --> 01:42:30.545]  Oh, hi. Your voice sounded like a bird's voice.
[01:42:30.545 --> 01:42:40.545]   Have you talked to your parents about going out of state to get care?
[01:42:41.111 --> 01:42:57.754]  Uh, well, my parents are very transphobic, um, and are not, um, they're very right leaning and they do not, um, support my transition or even me identifying, um, you know, with he, him pronouns.
[01:42:58.334 --> 01:43:04.855]  I know it doesn't probably help to hear this, but, you know, once you're 18, you'll be able to do whatever you want.
[01:43:04.915 --> 01:43:05.916]  That's how a president talks.
[01:43:05.936 --> 01:43:07.976]  Sometimes kids decide by the time they're 16-ish.
[01:43:08.516 --> 01:43:15.516]   to get emancipated as they say, to get a job and be on their own, which probably sounds
[01:43:15.516 --> 01:43:18.625]  terrible and hard but it could happen and it does for some.
[01:43:18.625 --> 01:43:21.666]   And when they're on their own and they're emancipated they can make their own
[01:43:21.666 --> 01:43:24.516]   decisions about what medical treatment they want.
[01:43:24.516 --> 01:43:36.516]   I have a question, you know, how do you deal with transphobic parents?
[01:43:36.689 --> 01:43:41.692]  You know, of course, we do hear about parents that will get crazy and get, like, you know what I mean?
[01:43:41.752 --> 01:43:44.073]  It's crazy not to want to talk your kids up.
[01:43:44.093 --> 01:43:46.195]  Crazy not to want to mutilate your child's genitals.
[01:43:46.355 --> 01:43:49.276]  That's crazy.
[01:43:49.437 --> 01:43:58.782]  But there are parents, you'd be surprised, I mean, there are parents who say absolutely no, no way, blah blah, this is dumb, this is, you know, unhealthy.
[01:43:59.302 --> 01:44:00.843]  I mean, what type of cult is this?
[01:44:00.963 --> 01:44:02.803]  What type of demonic activity is this?
[01:44:02.823 --> 01:44:05.924]  So, look, this goes on, folks, but you need to understand.
[01:44:05.784 --> 01:44:09.123]  What type of demonic activity is this?
[01:44:09.123 --> 01:44:10.463]  Very far right.
[01:44:10.463 --> 01:44:14.223]  Right, like Trumpsters you mean?
[01:44:14.223 --> 01:44:15.803]  Yeah, yeah, very.
[01:44:15.803 --> 01:44:20.643]   And you know how a lot of people say, and there's been studies about it.
[01:44:20.643 --> 01:44:23.184]  So look, this goes on folks, but you need to understand.
[01:44:23.184 --> 01:44:34.544]   These leftist demons will give your children drugs, they'll subject your children to body altering surgery,
[01:44:35.384 --> 01:44:42.564]   they'll send them all kinds of sex items, and they do it all behind the parents' backs.
[01:44:42.564 --> 01:44:52.564]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:45.490]  Right to jail!
[01:44:46.510 --> 01:44:47.151]  Straight to jail!
[01:44:47.391 --> 01:44:51.193]  My goodness, we have had ourselves a show so far.
[01:44:54.635 --> 01:44:58.856]   Joe Biden and the Democrats, Opening the borders.
[01:45:00.577 --> 01:45:02.217]  Releasing killers into the country.
[01:45:02.237 --> 01:45:07.899]  Joe Biden and the Democrats coming after your Second Amendment, just like all authoritarians.
[01:45:08.399 --> 01:45:09.299]  Take the guns.
[01:45:10.679 --> 01:45:13.360]  Ezra Levant talking about the speech crimes now.
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:15.160]  The emotion crimes.
[01:45:16.501 --> 01:45:17.521]  Truth crimes.
[01:45:18.821 --> 01:45:20.222]  Being introduced in Canada.
[01:45:20.242 --> 01:45:24.803]  And then you hear from these leftist demons.
[01:45:26.016 --> 01:45:35.998]  I don't know how else to describe that other than demonic, pedophilic, talk about genital mutilation and access to children, behind the parents' backs.
[01:45:38.399 --> 01:45:40.900]  I mean, what else would you call that?
[01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:45.481]  Wow, we have had ourselves a transmission.
[01:45:45.561 --> 01:45:55.583]   But ladies and gentlemen, if you like transmissions like this, if you like the Alex Jones Show, if you like InfoWars, you need to support us at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:47:04.724 --> 01:47:07.225]  Why is the winter considered flu season, cold season?
[01:47:07.245 --> 01:47:11.066]  Because you're not getting the proper vitamin D like you do during the summer.
[01:47:11.166 --> 01:47:11.887]  So what do we do?
[01:47:11.947 --> 01:47:14.228]  We go out and find the best vitamin D supplements.
[01:47:14.908 --> 01:47:18.069]  We provide those at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:47:47.243 --> 01:47:49.144]  Oh, my parents let me eat gummies in the morning.
[01:47:49.544 --> 01:47:50.124]  Tastes great.
[01:47:50.785 --> 01:48:00.288]  Little do they know that you're just making sure they're getting their vitamin D3 during these winter months so that they can stay healthy and not get the flu and not get the cold.

[01:48:26.109 --> 01:48:27.930]  That keeps us on the air.
[01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:30.731]  Oh, and by the way, I'm drinking the InfoWars coffee today as well.
[01:48:30.831 --> 01:48:31.511]  It's great stuff.
[01:48:31.551 --> 01:48:32.412]  I'm on my third cup.
[01:48:33.392 --> 01:48:35.253]  That's how great it is on cup number three.
[01:48:35.773 --> 01:48:37.354]  You know, one an hour is probably fine.
[01:48:38.254 --> 01:48:39.795]  Probably have a fourth one for the fourth hour.
[01:48:40.755 --> 01:48:42.896]  And then I got other interviews I'm doing later today, too.
[01:48:42.996 --> 01:48:45.197]  So we might be drinking a lot of InfoWars coffee today.
[01:48:45.497 --> 01:48:46.778]  Just was feeling in a coffee mood.
[01:48:47.158 --> 01:48:48.158]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:48:49.459 --> 01:48:52.160]  Okay, boy oh boy, there is just so much to get to now.
[01:48:53.928 --> 01:48:59.509]  I guess we can deal with the rest of this political news, and then we can deal with some of the geopolitical news.
[01:49:02.610 --> 01:49:08.452]  So, Joe Biden refuses to take a cognitive test, and we all know why that is.
[01:49:08.752 --> 01:49:14.293]  He would obviously fail it, just like the special counsel report from Robert Herr revealed.
[01:49:15.413 --> 01:49:22.635]  By the way, tomorrow, a fifth witness against the Biden crime family is going to enter a testimony.
[01:49:25.063 --> 01:49:39.747]  And then I think it's next week, I don't know, maybe you guys can find the exact date, but I think it's next week, Special Counsel Robert Herr is going to have an open public testimony in front of Congress.
[01:49:40.787 --> 01:49:44.828]  So, get ready for that!
[01:49:47.475 --> 01:49:48.496]  Get ready for that.
[01:49:49.056 --> 01:50:05.565]  And of course, you know, not just the documents that the Vice President Joe Biden took illegally, held illegally, and then shared the information illegally, three different crimes from the special counsel's report, not just are the documents going to be brought up.
[01:50:05.945 --> 01:50:06.385]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:50:06.405 --> 01:50:06.785]  Thank you, guys.
[01:50:07.025 --> 01:50:07.626]  March 12th.
[01:50:09.127 --> 01:50:11.468]  So we're just a few short weeks away.
[01:50:11.668 --> 01:50:12.268]  March 12th.
[01:50:12.588 --> 01:50:13.509]  You're on this leap day.
[01:50:18.357 --> 01:50:30.065]  Not just are we going to be learning more about the documents that Biden had illegally, obviously Biden's mental health and fitness is going to be brought up as well.
[01:50:31.126 --> 01:50:40.152]  And I'm telling you, this is going to be crazy because... You can't say anything is going to be the end of Joe Biden.
[01:50:41.253 --> 01:50:43.975]  Because the Democrats will decide what is going to be the end of Joe Biden.
[01:50:45.115 --> 01:50:47.377]  Whether they allow him to get the nomination or not.
[01:50:49.164 --> 01:50:55.229]  And the Republicans have to be very strategic about all of this because they don't want to do the Democrats the biggest favor ever.
[01:50:55.409 --> 01:50:57.731]  And that would be by removing Joe Biden for them.
[01:51:00.733 --> 01:51:03.395]  So it's almost like this hearing comes a little too early.
[01:51:03.415 --> 01:51:07.498]  You almost want Joe Biden to continue to do what he's doing, even though it's going to be deadly.
[01:51:07.518 --> 01:51:08.159]  I mean, literally.
[01:51:08.359 --> 01:51:08.919]  So I don't know.
[01:51:08.979 --> 01:51:09.740]  You can make the debate.
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:13.062]  The Biden presidency is going to be more deadly.
[01:51:14.824 --> 01:51:18.687]  And then in August, there's going to be the DNC in Chicago.
[01:51:20.086 --> 01:51:24.569]  And then I'd say that's when you want to drop all the hammers on Biden after the Democrats nominate him.
[01:51:26.069 --> 01:51:28.171]  And then you just completely politically eviscerate him.
[01:51:29.091 --> 01:51:41.838]  But also the argument of, you have to get rid of Biden now, otherwise more people are going to die in war, more people are going to die from the open borders, but that's going to happen no matter what Democrat is in charge.
[01:51:43.159 --> 01:51:44.100]  Well, either way, it doesn't matter.
[01:51:45.031 --> 01:52:00.079]  We're going to learn more about, so it's going to be Republicans asking about the documents, getting the answers, Republicans asking about Biden's fitness, getting the answers, and then all the Democrats, all the political propaganda from the Democrats, they won't even be asking questions.
[01:52:00.099 --> 01:52:06.102]  They'll be attacking Robert Herr, and they'll just be making statements defending Joe Biden, ignoring the issue.
[01:52:06.742 --> 01:52:07.883]  And it's going to be beautiful!
[01:52:10.162 --> 01:52:16.568]  It's going to be must-see TV, and it's going to be tuned in as much as any other hearing ever on C-SPAN.
[01:52:16.608 --> 01:52:18.290]  Nobody used to watch C-SPAN 10 years ago.
[01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:20.251]  Now it's so compelling, everybody's watching it.
[01:52:22.093 --> 01:52:28.960]  And then the clips all get millions of views on social media, mostly Twitter, or X.
[01:52:31.454 --> 01:52:45.881]  And now, with every instance like this, you get an inch closer to reaching that threshold of Joe Biden being completely done politically.
[01:52:47.742 --> 01:52:52.104]  So it's the same phenomenon we see with the illegal immigration.
[01:52:53.064 --> 01:53:04.939]   It's the same phenomenon we see anytime these local Democrat mayors have press conferences Or do city council public speaking.
[01:53:05.759 --> 01:53:09.760]  The locals show up and they protest and they heckle.
[01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:13.021]  Because they know that the Democrats are destroying their communities.
[01:53:13.441 --> 01:53:15.902]  They know that the Democrats are putting illegal immigrants first.
[01:53:17.662 --> 01:53:26.685]  And every day, in every instance, in every example of that, we inch closer to that threshold of the Democrats being an irrelevant political party.
[01:53:28.325 --> 01:53:31.486]  That is except for the fact that they want to get rid of elections.
[01:53:33.106 --> 01:53:35.887]  That is, except for the fact they want to get rid of the Electoral College.
[01:53:35.907 --> 01:53:39.068]  That is, except for the fact they want to bring in the illegal immigrants to rig the votes.
[01:53:40.548 --> 01:53:45.189]  And, of course, we know probably they get... I mean, how many illegal votes do you think Joe Biden got in 2020?
[01:53:45.429 --> 01:53:45.809]  10 million?
[01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.890]  15 million?
[01:53:47.630 --> 01:53:52.351]  How many ballot stuffers did they have working for them with the mail-in ballots?
[01:53:55.372 --> 01:53:58.673]  But all of this is going to lead to the same thing.
[01:54:00.606 --> 01:54:10.780]  Now you see polls where 40% of Americans believe that Donald Trump won the 2020 election, but it was stolen, and that Joe Biden got in with voter fraud.
[01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:12.442]  That's 40% general population.
[01:54:12.843 --> 01:54:22.377]   About 60% of Republicans It's over 50 now of Republicans believe that Joe Biden only got in office via voter fraud.
[01:54:22.937 --> 01:54:26.340]  So can you imagine what it would be like in 2024 if the Democrats won again?
[01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:28.201]  If Trump lost again?
[01:54:28.241 --> 01:54:29.082]  If Joe Biden won again?
[01:54:29.462 --> 01:54:34.346]  Folks, that number will shoot up to 50 to 60% of Americans will believe it's fraudulent.
[01:54:35.287 --> 01:54:46.865]   And then once they've reached that point, their political power can only be held onto and enforced With the barrel of a gun.
[01:54:49.326 --> 01:54:54.669]  And with the gavel on the bench by a far leftist activist judge.
[01:54:57.131 --> 01:55:03.254]  And then the American people will see just how corrupt the Democrats are and what follows after that.
[01:55:06.336 --> 01:55:08.777]  Well, that's a whole new world, isn't it?
[01:55:10.378 --> 01:55:18.664]   So they can try to avoid the issue with Joe Biden's mental health, but it's inevitably It's inevitably coming to the fore.
[01:55:20.545 --> 01:55:22.987]  Joe Biden not happy about Mitch McConnell stepping down.
[01:55:23.547 --> 01:55:24.028]  Oh, really?
[01:55:24.068 --> 01:55:27.010]  Of course not, because Mitch McConnell is basically Chuck Schumer's bitch.
[01:55:28.471 --> 01:55:30.312]  Chuck Schumer, the dirtiest rat.
[01:55:30.692 --> 01:55:33.534]  Chuck Schumer is a dirty, dirty rat.
[01:55:35.095 --> 01:55:38.738]  Chuck Schumer is likely the most corrupt senator in the history of this country.
[01:55:38.778 --> 01:55:43.121]  Chuck Schumer is likely the most dirty, corrupt rat.
[01:55:44.161 --> 01:55:46.462]  That the US Senate has ever seen.
[01:55:46.623 --> 01:55:50.145]  And he drags Mitch McConnell around by his leash.
[01:55:52.746 --> 01:56:21.425]   And you had Mike Johnson, who's about as strong as a wet noodle, in the Oval Office negotiating on behalf of the American people going up against The anti-American Mitch McConnell, the anti-American Hakeem Jeffries, the anti-American Chuck Schumer, the anti-American Joe Biden, the anti-American Vice President Kamala Harris, and he's up there just like, uh, you guys want all this money for Ukraine and Israel and Taiwan, like, can I just get some border funding?
[01:56:21.925 --> 01:56:22.506]  And they say, nope!
[01:56:23.746 --> 01:56:28.228]  Nope, but we got money, we got money for all these foreign countries, but no, we're not doing any border funding.
[01:56:30.469 --> 01:56:33.770]  And unfortunately, Mike Johnson gets bullied and pushed around and then caves.
[01:56:35.848 --> 01:56:45.631]  But yeah, that's why Biden is not happy about Mitch McConnell stepping down because the next leader of the Republican Party is going to be closer to a Rand Paul or a J.D.
[01:56:45.691 --> 01:56:47.352]  Vance or a Josh Hawley.
[01:56:48.352 --> 01:56:49.712]  And they're not going to take this bullying.
[01:56:51.293 --> 01:56:52.433]  They're not going to take this bullying.
[01:56:52.453 --> 01:56:53.373]  They're going to stand firm.
[01:56:53.513 --> 01:56:56.034]  And that freaks the Democrats out.
[01:56:57.795 --> 01:56:58.735]  That freaks them out.
[01:57:01.016 --> 01:57:04.817]  And really what you have and this is the dynamic.
[01:57:07.861 --> 01:57:12.743]  The Democrat Party is a Uniparty unto itself.
[01:57:14.924 --> 01:57:23.507]  You don't see much division, you don't see much dereliction from the party message.
[01:57:23.727 --> 01:57:32.570]  Even when you started to see a little bit from the Squad or AOC, Nancy Pelosi whips them right into place.
[01:57:36.068 --> 01:57:39.850]  I don't know if it's your typical blackmail situation, but let's be perfectly clear.
[01:57:41.190 --> 01:57:50.215]  AOC and Cori Bush and Ilhan Omar, they all have some skeletons in their closet, let's just say.
[01:57:50.575 --> 01:57:55.597]  They all have all kinds of ethics problems and violations.
[01:57:56.898 --> 01:57:59.379]  So that's how they get wrangled up and put in line.
[01:58:00.595 --> 01:58:08.218]  Campaign fund, campaign funding crimes, money laundering, whatever else is going on, all these ethics issues.
[01:58:08.698 --> 01:58:16.381]  So they might divert for a second, but then they get whipped right back into place because they say, oh, you know, we could have you out of here tomorrow.
[01:58:16.821 --> 01:58:18.761]  We know all the money you spent on yourself.
[01:58:18.801 --> 01:58:20.462]  We know all the money you laundered to your family.
[01:58:20.862 --> 01:58:23.023]  You know, we know you married your brother for a green card.
[01:58:23.083 --> 01:58:25.844]  So it's time for you to get back in line.
[01:58:27.810 --> 01:58:31.011]  So that's why you don't see any diversion and the Democrats are a uniparty.
[01:58:31.051 --> 01:58:33.231]  Now, the Republican Party, not so fast.
[01:58:34.791 --> 01:58:52.674]  It used to be the uniparty was the Republicans and the Democrats both working to destroy the United States of America, both working for the largest donors and all these influence peddlers in DC, the military-industrial complex, the pharmaceutical-industrial complex.
[01:58:53.135 --> 01:58:55.355]  But there's a new Republican Party forming.
[01:58:57.239 --> 01:59:08.343]  And the ouster of Kevin McCarthy and the ouster of Ronna Romney McDaniel and the ouster of Mitch McConnell shows that it's not just forming, it's gaining strength, it's gaining momentum.
[01:59:10.303 --> 01:59:12.504]  And even Mike Johnson is like the fence sitter.
[01:59:15.025 --> 01:59:23.588]  There's a real chance, and this is the best chance I think we have, at least for maybe two or four years, to stop the bleeding.
[01:59:24.875 --> 01:59:31.079]  But there's a real chance in 2024 the Republicans get the Senate, the House, and the White House.
[01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:33.621]  It's the only chance we really have to stop the bleeding.
[01:59:35.962 --> 01:59:41.706]  Even if the Republicans don't get the Senate and Schumer remains in control, that's going to be a major obstacle.
[01:59:45.029 --> 01:59:49.031]  But there's a real chance that the Republicans could get the trifecta in 2024.
[01:59:51.333 --> 02:00:00.205]   And should that be the case, It's not going to be Mitch McConnell or Mike Johnson leading the Republicans in Congress.
[02:00:01.885 --> 02:00:06.907]  Like I said, it's going to be closer to the Matt Gaetz in the House.
[02:00:06.927 --> 02:00:10.808]  It's going to be closer to the Josh Hawley in the Senate.
[02:00:12.549 --> 02:00:13.509]  Not Mitch McConnell.
[02:00:15.509 --> 02:00:16.430]  Not Kevin McCarthy.
[02:00:17.370 --> 02:00:24.155]  And with Michael Watley and Laura Trump running the RNC, it's going to be an entirely different ballgame in the Republican Party now.
[02:00:24.195 --> 02:00:27.777]  So this is the new Republican Party.
[02:00:28.978 --> 02:00:32.741]  This is the reformation, the restoration of the Republican Party.
[02:00:34.102 --> 02:00:35.863]  Doesn't cower to political correctness.
[02:00:38.185 --> 02:00:41.347]  Expects political results when corruption is found.
[02:00:42.839 --> 02:00:46.302]  Expects the Justice Department to do its job when corruption is found.
[02:00:46.322 --> 02:00:50.405]  Wants policy that puts America first.
[02:00:53.708 --> 02:01:00.994]  This is what the new Republican Party is going to represent in 2024, should it be victorious.
[02:01:01.034 --> 02:01:07.299]  But this is why the Democrats are going to pull out all kinds of dirty tricks and stops to try to stop that from happening.
[02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:15.323]   Because if that does happen, Or either way, it might be the end of them, but that's when they just start to rule with the iron fist.
[02:01:15.503 --> 02:01:19.204]  That's when they just start to rule from the barrel of the gun.
[02:01:19.744 --> 02:01:22.804]  Biden's late night interview with Seth Meyers was a ratings dud.
[02:01:23.485 --> 02:01:25.045]  Yeah, nobody watches anything Biden does.
[02:01:25.085 --> 02:01:26.905]  He goes up there with the Ukraine flag lapel pin.
[02:01:27.245 --> 02:01:29.106]  You can go to the Biden Twitter account.
[02:01:29.266 --> 02:01:31.626]  Everything he tweets, 99% of the replies negative.
[02:01:31.906 --> 02:01:33.887]  You can go to the White House YouTube channel.
[02:01:34.227 --> 02:01:36.507]  All the comments on there, 99% negative.
[02:01:37.847 --> 02:01:39.008]  Biden doesn't have rallies.
[02:01:39.168 --> 02:01:39.408]  Why?
[02:01:39.428 --> 02:01:40.488]  Because nobody would show up.
[02:01:44.411 --> 02:01:46.411]  But he got 81 million votes though.
[02:01:48.272 --> 02:01:50.292]  What kind of freaking idiot believes that?
[02:01:53.013 --> 02:01:54.874]  And there's all this, there's all the headlines now.
[02:01:56.094 --> 02:01:59.115]  Tucker Carlson on 2020 election, it was 100% stolen.
[02:02:00.355 --> 02:02:15.251]   And look, this is so great because Tucker probably All Things Considered is the most trusted American journalist, the most trusted American broadcaster out there now.
[02:02:15.552 --> 02:02:23.118]  From all the different angles and perspectives and political opinions, he's probably the most trusted.
[02:02:23.159 --> 02:02:26.502]  So they can lie about him and try to destroy his character as much as they want, it's not working.
[02:02:29.304 --> 02:02:32.447]  You say, well wait, so Tucker Carlson says it was stolen, so is everybody else.
[02:02:33.047 --> 02:02:50.318]   But that's the point, is because he's the most trusted, It just reaffirms what everyone else is saying, and it just catapults the counter-narrative that Joe Biden won fair and square.
[02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:53.680]  No.
[02:02:56.122 --> 02:02:56.962]  It was stolen.
[02:02:57.122 --> 02:02:58.563]  It's okay to say that.
[02:02:59.524 --> 02:03:00.404]  It was stolen.
[02:03:00.805 --> 02:03:02.325]  It's okay to talk about it.
[02:03:03.146 --> 02:03:04.007]  It was stolen.
[02:03:04.647 --> 02:03:05.628]  Everybody knows it.
[02:03:06.678 --> 02:03:17.966]  And now Tucker Carlson is like the final battering ram, the final wrecking ball that destroys that wall that says, don't talk about it, don't mention it, oh I don't know, no, obviously it was stolen.
[02:03:22.269 --> 02:03:31.258]   And by the way, I mean, I don't know, maybe, maybe Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson might Just need to collab on something soon.
[02:03:31.278 --> 02:03:31.739]  I don't know.
[02:03:31.779 --> 02:03:33.059]  I just, I don't know.
[02:03:33.079 --> 02:03:33.580]  Maybe it should happen.
[02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:34.681]  Biden's America.
[02:03:35.101 --> 02:03:38.603]  Macy's closing 150 stores nationwide.
[02:03:39.284 --> 02:03:42.646]  San Francisco store says rampant shoplifting to blame for closing.
[02:03:44.107 --> 02:03:50.852]  So it's the, it's the crime level in Biden and Democrat run America, Democrat run cities.
[02:03:50.932 --> 02:03:53.694]  It's the Biden economy where people just don't go out and shop anymore.
[02:03:53.714 --> 02:03:54.434]  They can't afford it.
[02:03:54.514 --> 02:03:56.395]  It's what the Democrats have planned for America.
[02:03:56.555 --> 02:03:58.377]  Shut it down.
[02:03:59.599 --> 02:04:00.039]  Don't you see?
[02:04:00.839 --> 02:04:02.920]  Just shut it all down.
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:05.720]  You can't afford to go out.
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:12.522]  I mean, even here in Austin, it used to be... I mean, I'd go out to dinner on a Friday night or Saturday night.
[02:04:13.222 --> 02:04:20.563]  If I didn't have a dinner reservation in by Wednesday, I was not getting a table on a Friday or Saturday night.
[02:04:22.844 --> 02:04:26.145]  I can call up an hour before any restaurant I want.
[02:04:26.505 --> 02:04:27.385]  Plenty of tables available.
[02:04:29.087 --> 02:04:31.048]  When Trump was president, couldn't even get a reservation.
[02:04:32.389 --> 02:04:34.410]  Nowadays, walk right in.
[02:04:35.571 --> 02:04:36.411]  That's Biden's America.
[02:04:36.852 --> 02:04:38.092]  Shut down the stores!
[02:04:40.894 --> 02:04:42.295]  Break America's economy!
[02:04:42.395 --> 02:04:43.395]  Break the energy!
[02:04:43.516 --> 02:04:44.356]  Break it all!
[02:04:45.757 --> 02:04:52.761]  So understand, the phenomenon of Macy's closing is just the larger picture.
[02:04:52.801 --> 02:04:55.803]  That's just the result of what the Democrats have planned for America.
[02:04:57.066 --> 02:04:57.346]  Shut.
[02:04:57.927 --> 02:04:58.047]  It.
[02:04:58.547 --> 02:04:58.967]  Down.
[02:05:01.149 --> 02:05:03.370]  The rise of the do-nothing vacation.
[02:05:03.710 --> 02:05:04.951]  Well, yeah, that's the Biden economy.
[02:05:05.051 --> 02:05:06.272]  Nobody can afford vacation.
[02:05:07.212 --> 02:05:08.373]  So you don't go anywhere.
[02:05:09.454 --> 02:05:10.754]  You can't go on vacation.
[02:05:11.055 --> 02:05:17.418]  You either can't take the time off work because you're living paycheck to paycheck, or you can't afford to travel, so you just have what they call a staycation.
[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:22.121]  That's the Biden Democrat economy.
[02:05:22.581 --> 02:05:23.122]  Don't you see?
[02:05:26.328 --> 02:05:27.189]  Don't you see?
[02:05:27.209 --> 02:05:32.333]  And they're trying to buy votes.
[02:05:35.416 --> 02:05:38.278]  They're trying to steal votes, produce votes, buy votes.
[02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:42.402]  And so they've quote-unquote cancelled student debt.
[02:05:42.422 --> 02:05:43.523]  Of course, you can't cancel debt.
[02:05:43.563 --> 02:05:45.004]  They're just making you pay the debt.
[02:05:45.144 --> 02:05:46.365]  So no debt was cancelled.
[02:05:46.946 --> 02:05:54.589]   They just took the debt from the Ivy League worthless We have been doing work to promote voter participation for students.
[02:05:54.409 --> 02:05:57.009]  the electrician is paying for it, you're paying for it.
[02:05:57.009 --> 02:05:59.449]  And now Kamala Harris, they have a new way to buy votes.
[02:05:59.449 --> 02:06:02.969]   Here she is talking about another way they're going to just give you free money in clip
[02:06:02.969 --> 02:06:04.869]  16.
[02:06:04.869 --> 02:06:10.569]   We have been doing work to promote voter participation for students.
[02:06:10.569 --> 02:06:16.729]   And for example, we have under the federal work study program now allows students to
[02:06:16.729 --> 02:06:19.529]  get paid through federal.
[02:06:19.322 --> 02:06:25.402]   work study to register people and to be nonpartisan poll workers.
[02:06:25.402 --> 02:06:28.322]  As we know this is important for a number of reasons.
[02:06:28.322 --> 02:06:36.601]   One, to engage our young leaders in this process and activate them in terms of their ability
[02:06:36.601 --> 02:06:40.520]  to strengthen our communities.
[02:06:40.512 --> 02:06:41.493]  Does anybody take her seriously?
[02:06:41.993 --> 02:06:49.139]  And now here's how they're producing votes, and here's how they plan to rig the election with mail-in ballots in clip 13.
[02:06:49.199 --> 02:06:55.504]  Got our voters' pamphlets.
[02:06:58.606 --> 02:07:02.610]  Now you check on the outside of your pamphlet what party you're affiliated with.
[02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:06.793]  I mean, I guess that just makes it easier for them to toss away the red ones.
[02:07:08.112 --> 02:07:08.813]  Bingo!
[02:07:10.534 --> 02:07:11.815]  So now they just have it marked.
[02:07:11.835 --> 02:07:12.715]  You mark it for you.
[02:07:12.755 --> 02:07:16.978]  They see a Republican mail-in ballot and it makes its way into the trash can.
[02:07:17.198 --> 02:07:18.999]  And then Biden gets 81 million votes.
[02:07:18.899 --> 02:07:26.578]   swoop dee doo! In 60 seconds I don't have time to tell you about all the incredible ingredients in

[02:08:30.495 --> 02:08:37.177]  So, as I said before, there is no evidence because there is no evidence, and today only confirmed that.
[02:08:37.197 --> 02:08:37.537]  Thank you.
[02:08:37.557 --> 02:08:43.298]  Mr. Biden, was the cocaine at the White House yours?
[02:08:43.938 --> 02:08:45.159]  Okay, there is no evidence.
[02:08:46.519 --> 02:08:48.160]  Whose cocaine was at the White House?
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:49.180]  I'm sure it wasn't Hunter's.
[02:08:51.254 --> 02:08:52.054]  Maybe it was Joe's?
[02:08:54.435 --> 02:08:55.016]  Kamala's?
[02:08:55.056 --> 02:08:55.596]  Kamal Hor's?
[02:08:55.616 --> 02:08:55.896]  I don't know.
[02:08:57.537 --> 02:08:59.498]  Whose cocaine was at the White House?
[02:08:59.598 --> 02:09:01.619]  Yeah, uh, yeah, he looked, uh, mm-hmm.
[02:09:02.139 --> 02:09:03.459]  He looked strung out on something.
[02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:05.640]  Does Hunter Biden get drugs?
[02:09:05.700 --> 02:09:07.721]  I actually think he, but doesn't he get drugs?
[02:09:09.182 --> 02:09:09.562]  I don't know.
[02:09:09.602 --> 02:09:11.403]  I mean, I get drugs, but Hunter Biden probably not.
[02:09:11.443 --> 02:09:12.423]  No reason to do that, I'm sure.
[02:09:13.144 --> 02:09:13.824]  No reason for that.
[02:09:16.047 --> 02:09:17.408]  It's just such an embarrassment.
[02:09:17.928 --> 02:09:22.610]  But to recap briefly, and we're about to go to a Kareem Jean Pear clip, folks.
[02:09:25.971 --> 02:09:37.596]  I try to prepare myself when I cover this stuff not to lose my temper and blow up and just scream at this microphone because it's just so infuriating.
[02:09:38.297 --> 02:09:42.959]  But... I mean, that's the natural, organic response.
[02:09:44.096 --> 02:09:48.059]  What Karine Jean-Pierre just said about Lake and Riley's death.
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:53.142]  I mean, I'm going to want to flip this desk over.
[02:09:53.242 --> 02:09:56.044]  I'm going to want to start, you know, give me something to break.
[02:09:57.965 --> 02:10:00.907]  These people are such scum.
[02:10:03.449 --> 02:10:11.674]  This could be the lowest moment in Karine Jean-Pierre's time as Biden's press secretary, if you can even believe that.
[02:10:13.274 --> 02:10:14.795]  These people have no shame.
[02:10:15.475 --> 02:10:16.496]  They have no guilt.
[02:10:19.337 --> 02:10:21.718]  We are dealing with a truly pathetic bunch here.
[02:10:21.778 --> 02:10:27.561]  We are dealing with demonic entities right now, leading our country.
[02:10:28.142 --> 02:10:31.943]  And this clip from Corrine Jean-Pierre is going to make your blood boil.
[02:10:32.664 --> 02:10:34.745]  And I hope Blake and Riley's family sees this.
[02:10:34.825 --> 02:10:36.946]  Not because I wish them any harm or trauma.
[02:10:37.006 --> 02:10:37.366]  I don't.
[02:10:37.826 --> 02:10:38.487]  They've had enough.
[02:10:39.027 --> 02:10:42.089]  But... I just...
[02:10:44.602 --> 02:10:54.747]  They need to know that the people that caused your daughter's brutal murder do not have any sense of remorse.
[02:10:55.687 --> 02:10:57.328]  They don't have any sense of guilt.
[02:11:00.170 --> 02:11:10.895]  And unfortunately, and it's sad, but unfortunately they're gonna have to really fight for justice here.
[02:11:14.537 --> 02:11:21.143]  And it doesn't end with the illegal immigrant that killed their daughter.
[02:11:23.245 --> 02:11:24.787]  Justice goes straight to the source.
[02:11:27.990 --> 02:11:28.831]  And that's the White House.
[02:11:31.393 --> 02:11:38.600]  And so this Crangene Pear clip we're about to play is just... It's truly next level.
[02:11:41.547 --> 02:11:50.370]  But to briefly wrap up what happened in yesterday's Hunter Biden testimony, everything his lawyer just said there was a lie, obviously.
[02:11:51.911 --> 02:12:05.796]  And what actually happened was Nancy Mace basically said that Hunter Biden has perjured himself and that multiple claims made by Hunter Biden in his testimony were lies and they have the proof that they were lies.
[02:12:06.776 --> 02:12:15.190]   They're talking about an open hearing, a public hearing coming next, Matt Gaetz also came out and said similar things.
[02:12:15.310 --> 02:12:29.633]  Jim Jordan and Jim Comer and Representative Smith from Missouri were on all with Sean Hannity last night and they all basically said the same thing.
[02:12:30.353 --> 02:12:33.254]  So forget about what Hunter's lying attorney just said.
[02:12:34.834 --> 02:12:36.455]  But they have to be smarter than this.
[02:12:36.755 --> 02:12:37.635]  So here's the deal.
[02:12:41.181 --> 02:12:46.025]  And any lawyer understands this when you come in with a strategy in an open and shut case like this.
[02:12:46.245 --> 02:12:48.187]  They're not fishing for information.
[02:12:48.927 --> 02:12:51.570]  They don't really need any answers to these questions.
[02:12:51.610 --> 02:12:53.611]  They're building a case.
[02:12:54.632 --> 02:13:02.298]  In other words, the House Oversight Committee already has all the bank records, wire transfers, checks.
[02:13:03.059 --> 02:13:04.560]  They have four witness testimonies.
[02:13:04.580 --> 02:13:07.623]  They're about to get a fifth of Hunter Biden's business partners.
[02:13:08.922 --> 02:13:11.884]  They already have all of the evidence and all of the information.
[02:13:12.604 --> 02:13:22.690]  So they're essentially now cross-examining Hunter Biden, getting his testimony, and then they're gonna cross that with all the other testimony and the bank records that they have.
[02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:27.152]  And everything that Hunter Biden said to them yesterday was a lie!
[02:13:29.013 --> 02:13:31.014]  Now, Hunter Biden might be dumb enough.
[02:13:31.935 --> 02:13:34.576]  His lawyer probably knows what's going on, but I guess his lawyer doesn't really care.
[02:13:34.596 --> 02:13:37.058]  If Hunter Biden goes down, his lawyer still gets paid.
[02:13:39.025 --> 02:13:41.007]  But maybe Hunter is that dumb to not realize.
[02:13:42.768 --> 02:14:04.925]  When you sit there and you say, I never contacted my father about business, money was never transferred to my father with any of these business dealings, they literally have the text message transcripts, the phone records, and the bank records, and four going on five witness testimonies that say the exact opposite.
[02:14:09.580 --> 02:14:13.910]  So, they don't need any evidence from Hunter Biden.
[02:14:14.250 --> 02:14:16.014]  They already have all the evidence.
[02:14:16.595 --> 02:14:18.920]  And Hunter Biden just went in front of them and lied about it all.
[02:14:20.697 --> 02:14:21.498]  And they know that!
[02:14:22.479 --> 02:14:40.380]  So now they're going to build their case for the public hearing, and Hunter Biden is going to be destroyed, and 10% for the big guy is going to be proven, and they're going to show all the bank records, they're going to show all the wire transfers, they're going to show all the personal checks, they're going to show transcripts from the other witness testimony, which will be five at that point.
[02:14:43.247 --> 02:14:56.579]  And all of the world and the country is going to see how Joe Biden was using James Biden and Hunter Biden to sell political favors all around the world, and he got 10% of the kickbacks.
[02:14:56.639 --> 02:15:03.144]  I mean, it's $2 million from this company, Joe Biden gets $200,000 in a personal check.
[02:15:03.765 --> 02:15:07.228]  $400,000 from this company, Joe Biden gets $40,000 into his bank account in a wire transfer.
[02:15:08.479 --> 02:15:10.260]  And then here's all the texts.
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:10.840]  10% for the big guy.
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:12.281]  We're selling the Biden brand.
[02:15:12.441 --> 02:15:13.001]  Here's Hunter Biden.
[02:15:13.021 --> 02:15:13.861]  My dad's sitting right here.
[02:15:13.881 --> 02:15:14.342]  Give me the money.
[02:15:16.683 --> 02:15:17.303]  It's open and shut.
[02:15:18.063 --> 02:15:25.787]  Now, could this be the lowest moment in Karine Jean-Pierre's time as the Biden press secretary?
[02:15:25.827 --> 02:15:28.528]  Ladies and gentlemen, I would take a deep breath.
[02:15:29.948 --> 02:15:35.231]  If you're driving, be careful because this clip is going to make your blood boil.
[02:15:36.155 --> 02:15:47.145]  The Biden administration has blood on its hands, not just with illegal immigrants, but with the drone attack in Jordan and just all over the planet and Ukraine.
[02:15:47.966 --> 02:15:51.449]  And here's Kareem Jean-Pierre commenting on the death of Lake and Riley.
[02:15:51.489 --> 02:15:53.952]  This is just going to make your blood boil.
[02:15:55.308 --> 02:16:19.528]   I mean this is a horrific horrific loss for any family and obviously any if whoever is found guilty we need to make sure that make sure that that happens and obviously we don't want to we don't want to see anything happen like that again but here's the thing we have done the work Uh, to make sure we're dealing with a broken immigration system.
[02:16:19.868 --> 02:16:21.470]  The Republicans have gotten in the way.
[02:16:21.890 --> 02:16:22.971]  They have gotten in the way.
[02:16:23.451 --> 02:16:27.875]  And that's what we continue to see over and over and over again.
[02:16:28.415 --> 02:16:31.178]  And so, look, this is a serious, this is a serious matter.
[02:16:31.658 --> 02:16:32.599]  No, I want to play that again.
[02:16:34.220 --> 02:16:38.464]  She stumbles and fumbles and stammers talking about Lake and Riley.
[02:16:39.825 --> 02:16:41.026]  And then makes it about them.
[02:16:41.306 --> 02:16:43.187]  And then makes it about how good of a job they're doing.
[02:16:43.227 --> 02:16:43.568]  Play it again.
[02:16:46.252 --> 02:16:49.714]  I mean, this is a horrific, horrific loss for any family.
[02:16:49.734 --> 02:16:57.358]  And obviously, if whoever is found guilty, we need to make sure that that happens.
[02:16:57.538 --> 02:17:02.901]  And obviously, we don't want to see anything happen like that again.
[02:17:03.121 --> 02:17:04.002]  But here's the thing.
[02:17:04.642 --> 02:17:10.466]  We have done the work to make sure we're dealing with a broken immigration system.
[02:17:10.826 --> 02:17:12.407]  The Republicans have gotten in the way.
[02:17:12.828 --> 02:17:13.908]  They have gotten in the way.
[02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:18.812]  And that's what we continue to see over and over and over again.
[02:17:19.352 --> 02:17:24.155]  And so, look, this is a serious, this is a serious- Folks, that is so purely despicable.
[02:17:24.175 --> 02:17:27.017]  I think it's the lowest moment of her career.
[02:17:28.478 --> 02:17:33.622]  Yeah, oh, Laken Riley's death was tragic, but we're doing a great job and Republicans are the bad guy.
[02:17:34.758 --> 02:17:38.099]  I'm gonna say this calm and collectively for every American that just heard that.
[02:17:38.979 --> 02:17:42.360]  Fuck you, Karine Jean-Pierre, and fuck this administration!
[02:17:42.740 --> 02:17:47.401]  You know, this Biden administration has blood on its hands from all over the world.
[02:17:47.701 --> 02:18:00.024]  Ukraine, Jordan, Israel, Gaza Strip, Afghanistan, and of course right here, domestically as well.
[02:18:01.732 --> 02:18:13.482]  But I want to get into some of the geopolitical issues and perhaps we should start this off with one of the most corrupted individuals involved in foreign policy.
[02:18:13.962 --> 02:18:21.689]  The sooner this woman is out of power or even behind bars, the sooner peace will return to planet Earth.
[02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:23.310]  That's Victoria Newland.
[02:18:23.911 --> 02:18:31.838]   Here she is asked about the bio labs That the Biden's seem to have their hands all over as well that existed in Ukraine.
[02:18:32.944 --> 02:18:49.117]  Ukraine has biological research facilities, which in fact we are now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of.
[02:18:49.277 --> 02:19:01.688]  So we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach.
[02:19:02.441 --> 02:19:06.364]  Victoria Nuland is a demon in a female bodysuit.
[02:19:10.427 --> 02:19:16.172]  Now, let's take what she just said and let's give the context of reality to it.
[02:19:17.413 --> 02:19:18.173]  The U.S.
[02:19:19.414 --> 02:19:29.002]  started to move its illegal biological research out of the country when it became illegal in 2014.
[02:19:31.206 --> 02:19:36.309]  Now by the way, they are bringing it back with Biden, but that's another story.
[02:19:37.149 --> 02:19:44.913]  It's well known, in Obama's years, when it was made illegal to do gain-of-function research, that the U.S.
[02:19:44.933 --> 02:19:46.874]  had to outsource this research.
[02:19:47.495 --> 02:19:51.697]  So they outsourced it to China, and they outsourced it to Ukraine.
[02:19:54.969 --> 02:19:56.749]  Now, it was all still illegal.
[02:19:56.869 --> 02:19:58.090]  It was all still U.S.
[02:19:58.130 --> 02:20:01.650]  funds going towards it and it was all still being run by Anthony Fauci.
[02:20:03.451 --> 02:20:09.432]  And Newland was just kind of the overseer of all other foreign policy geopolitics.
[02:20:10.532 --> 02:20:15.613]  Fauci was the mad scientist involved in it.
[02:20:18.714 --> 02:20:22.635]  So remember, first they denied the biological labs existed.
[02:20:22.715 --> 02:20:24.155]  Now they have to admit they existed.
[02:20:25.126 --> 02:20:30.888]  Same thing with, oh, COVID didn't come from a lab in Wuhan funded by Anthony Fauci.
[02:20:30.968 --> 02:20:35.130]  Okay, yes, COVID did come from a lab in Wuhan, China, funded by Anthony Fauci.
[02:20:35.450 --> 02:20:37.131]  There were no biological labs in Ukraine.
[02:20:37.171 --> 02:20:40.892]  Okay, yes, there were biological labs in Ukraine, and we think Russia is trying to get them.
[02:20:40.952 --> 02:20:41.232]  No.
[02:20:43.433 --> 02:20:44.994]  Russia's trying to shut them down.
[02:20:46.934 --> 02:20:51.376]  Because Russia knows Victoria Nuland is a psychotic demon in a female bodysuit.
[02:20:53.769 --> 02:21:00.294]  And might use chemical or biological warfare against Russians or against Ukrainians.
[02:21:03.437 --> 02:21:07.300]  So, here's the latest in the news dealing with all this.
[02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:12.343]  Leaked files reveal Russian military's criteria for a nuclear strike.
[02:21:12.363 --> 02:21:13.284]  This is all over the news.
[02:21:13.624 --> 02:21:17.988]  Putin threatens to nuke West after accusing NATO of planning to strike Russia.
[02:21:19.946 --> 02:21:33.810]  Now, let's remember, just, oh, and they're repeating this narrative now, Newland was repeating it too, that Russia has spaked space nukes and that Russia is positioning space nukes to strike the United States of America.
[02:21:35.551 --> 02:21:43.333]  Well, let's kind of put all the noise aside for a second and let's just deal with some harsh realities.
[02:21:45.913 --> 02:21:47.494]  You can think whatever you want about Putin.
[02:21:49.827 --> 02:21:55.670]  Bad guy, good guy, tyrant, murderer, or soft-hearted puppy lover.
[02:21:58.831 --> 02:22:03.693]  The leadership in the United States of America is psychotic.
[02:22:05.074 --> 02:22:15.508]   Joe Biden, Victoria Nuland, Chuck Schumer, General Milley, These are psychotic people, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:15.968 --> 02:22:21.110]  These are individuals that represent a much larger danger to the world than Vladimir Putin.
[02:22:25.492 --> 02:22:31.534]  How many countries with the foreign policy under the psychotic leadership of the United States have been invaded?
[02:22:32.255 --> 02:22:41.178]  How many countries under the psychotic leadership of the United States have had wars brought to their lands because of political influence in the United States?
[02:22:41.278 --> 02:22:42.999]  The CIA, the proxy groups.
[02:22:45.327 --> 02:22:45.827]  Dozens?
[02:22:49.310 --> 02:22:52.752]  How many foreign military bases does Russia have versus the United States?
[02:22:53.953 --> 02:22:57.815]  How many wars has Russia launched in foreign countries versus the United States?
[02:23:00.056 --> 02:23:02.078]  That's not an endorsement of Putin or Russia.
[02:23:02.418 --> 02:23:04.399]  That's a basic question with basic answers.
[02:23:04.959 --> 02:23:07.761]  But the answers go against the narrative, you see.
[02:23:12.580 --> 02:23:17.141]  I could look at all of this and just say, well, this is just more anti-Russia propaganda, and we all know why.
[02:23:20.242 --> 02:23:24.783]  But I also have to be not so naive.
[02:23:27.784 --> 02:23:36.787]  And this might be a basic statement to make for a complex issue, but why did the United States nuke Japan twice?
[02:23:39.228 --> 02:23:53.884]   Well, it was said that if Japan didn't suffer these losses that the psychotic Japanese leadership would have ended up killing more people than were lost in those strikes, and so they had to put an end to it with these nuclear strikes.
[02:23:55.664 --> 02:24:00.787]  Well, what if somebody decided to apply that exact same logic towards the United States of America?
[02:24:01.607 --> 02:24:04.348]  Now again, this could all be lies, it could all be war propaganda.
[02:24:06.289 --> 02:24:08.210]  I'm just sitting here looking at all the angles.
[02:24:12.088 --> 02:24:13.470]  I don't want nuclear war.
[02:24:13.971 --> 02:24:26.652]  I don't want nuclear-capable countries like Russia to look at our psychotic leadership and think, well, we better do something here or they're going to cause much more death and destruction on the planet.
[02:24:30.427 --> 02:24:42.296]  And I think the whole world is reaching a point now, looking at the leadership in the United States of America, and they finally had a sigh of relief, and could take a breath of fresh air when we had Trump in for four years, and then what do you get?
[02:24:42.316 --> 02:24:46.299]  You get Biden, you get more war, you get more death, you get more destruction, you get more war propaganda.
[02:24:49.401 --> 02:24:55.346]  So, that's why it's so important for us to politically purge ourselves of these psychotic people.
[02:24:56.641 --> 02:25:03.103]  Like the Biden crime family, like Victoria Nuland, like Chuck Schumer, like the Democrat Party at large.
[02:25:06.124 --> 02:25:07.424]  Because I don't want nuclear war.
[02:25:09.244 --> 02:25:20.988]  And now you have this game of chicken, where the West is building it up like Russia or Putin needs to be struck first to avoid more catastrophes.
[02:25:21.708 --> 02:25:25.629]  And then they project that and they say, oh, Putin is aiming nukes at us.
[02:25:27.927 --> 02:25:30.188]  Well I don't know the truth because I get lied to all the time.
[02:25:31.709 --> 02:25:33.631]  But I do know that my leaders are psychotic.
[02:25:33.691 --> 02:25:43.177]  I do know that my leaders are warmongers that have blood all over their hands and have used my country's treasure and blood to start those wars and to kill innocent people.
[02:25:44.718 --> 02:25:47.940]  And they have no remorse and there's no ceasing in this behavior.
[02:25:50.301 --> 02:25:51.182]  I do know that.
[02:25:53.700 --> 02:25:55.021]  I don't know what Putin has planned.
[02:25:55.341 --> 02:26:02.326]  I'm not going to sit here and act like I know whether Putin is going to have space nukes or who's got space nukes or who's aiming nukes at who or who wants to have a first strike.
[02:26:04.327 --> 02:26:05.308]  I get lied to so much.
[02:26:05.348 --> 02:26:06.569]  I get lied to so much about history.
[02:26:06.609 --> 02:26:07.589]  Who freaking knows?
[02:26:09.531 --> 02:26:13.133]  I know that the Biden crime family is a bigger threat to my country than Vladimir Putin.
[02:26:13.453 --> 02:26:16.936]  I know that Victoria Nuland is a bigger threat to world peace than Vladimir Putin.
[02:26:17.896 --> 02:26:18.757]  I do know that.
[02:26:21.659 --> 02:26:22.860]  And then they lie to us more.
[02:26:24.111 --> 02:26:27.512]  Ukraine sees risk of Russia breaking through defenses by summer.
[02:26:27.812 --> 02:26:37.656]  Folks, if there have been a hundred battles in this Russian-Ukrainian war, if there have been a hundred battles, Ukraine has won one of them in two and a half years.
[02:26:39.457 --> 02:26:39.717]  Okay?
[02:26:40.297 --> 02:26:42.658]  So they're one for 99, or one for a hundred.
[02:26:43.779 --> 02:26:48.400]  And they act like Ukraine is somehow victorious, and then they ask us for more money, more weapons, because they're being defeated.
[02:26:48.700 --> 02:26:52.442]  The average age of the military member is 45, because they've killed all the young people.
[02:26:53.874 --> 02:26:56.435]  Russia could wipe out Ukraine in less than a week.
[02:26:57.115 --> 02:27:03.296]  Russia could take Kiev and take out Zelensky in a day if that was really their goal.
[02:27:04.596 --> 02:27:05.916]  So they just lied to about everything.
[02:27:06.356 --> 02:27:12.898]  And now they're provoking Russia by saying we're gonna make Ukraine a NATO country and we're gonna put nukes on your doorstep.
[02:27:12.958 --> 02:27:16.318]  I mean, folks, again, forget about what you think about Putin.
[02:27:16.338 --> 02:27:18.479]  He could be the worst person in the world, he could be the best person in the world.
[02:27:19.269 --> 02:27:21.371]  If, I mean, has this ever happened to you?
[02:27:21.651 --> 02:27:36.903]  If somebody comes up to you and starts spitting in your face, or flicking your ear, or poking your eye, and you say, stop doing that or I'm going to punch you, stop doing that or I'm going to punch you, stop doing that or I'm going to punch you, stop doing that or I'm going to punch you, and then they do it one more time, and then you punch them, who's to blame?
[02:27:40.025 --> 02:27:40.686]  Who's to blame?
[02:27:42.447 --> 02:27:44.428]  Because that's what they're doing to Putin in Russia now.
[02:27:45.049 --> 02:27:48.689]   And if both of us die, What brings this information?
[02:27:49.169 --> 02:27:53.431]  You can see here the Great Awakening orbiting the Great Reset.
[02:27:54.132 --> 02:28:03.897]  Although the depopulation systems of the Great Reset are not yet fully operational, the Great Reset does have a strong conspiracy network.
[02:28:04.337 --> 02:28:10.200]  It is protected by a satanic shield, which can be disabled by the Great Awakening.
[02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:16.844]  The Great Reset must be deactivated if any victory for humanity is to be accomplished.
[02:28:17.879 --> 02:28:31.932]  Once the Great Awakening deactivates the shield, InfoWars.com forward slash show will cover the truth while Info Warriors fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the Great Reset.
[02:28:32.412 --> 02:28:36.155]  Alex Jones has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.

[02:29:44.635 --> 02:29:53.355]   There's a reason why General Smedley Butler wrote in 1945, "War is a racket."
[02:29:53.355 --> 02:30:02.075]   Because the truth is traditional reasons, or throughout human history,
[02:30:02.075 --> 02:30:07.674]  the typical reasons of going to war are no longer necessary.
[02:30:07.928 --> 02:30:09.409]  We don't need to go to war for land.
[02:30:09.469 --> 02:30:10.690]  We can just build up.
[02:30:11.731 --> 02:30:13.532]  We don't need to go to war for resources.
[02:30:13.552 --> 02:30:16.495]  We have technology that we can have abundant resources for all.
[02:30:18.536 --> 02:30:20.378]  So what is the need for war now?
[02:30:20.518 --> 02:30:21.259]  Well, it's a racket.
[02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:23.240]  Money.
[02:30:23.621 --> 02:30:23.961]  Power.
[02:30:25.004 --> 02:30:32.004]  greed.
[02:30:32.004 --> 02:30:42.004]   So really, you could argue that war is not even necessary in the 21st century at all.
[02:30:41.836 --> 02:30:50.382]  And yet here we are, concerns of nuclear war among us.
[02:30:54.301 --> 02:30:56.783]  And it really is a game of chicken, nuclear chicken.
[02:30:56.803 --> 02:30:58.684]  It really is a game of political corruption.
[02:31:02.947 --> 02:31:12.574]  Because the leaders, like Victoria Nuland in the West, know if they're exposed, they're going to be seen as the true war criminals.
[02:31:14.936 --> 02:31:20.260]  The Biden administration knows if people knew the truth, they would be seen as the one with blood on their hands.
[02:31:24.517 --> 02:31:25.977]  And then you have the Washington Post.
[02:31:26.037 --> 02:31:28.378]  So what happened to the left being anti-war, by the way?
[02:31:28.438 --> 02:31:28.978]  That changed.
[02:31:29.518 --> 02:31:31.019]  It just shows you how they're all brainwashed.
[02:31:31.819 --> 02:31:36.921]  Or how their real foundation is, whatever conservatives are for, we're against it.
[02:31:37.141 --> 02:31:40.762]  So, during the Bush years, they saw conservatives were pro-war.
[02:31:40.802 --> 02:31:42.902]  They got tricked with the 9-11 false flag.
[02:31:45.203 --> 02:31:47.424]  And so the liberals came out as anti-war.
[02:31:47.644 --> 02:31:51.625]  But now that the conservative side of the aisle is anti-war, now the liberals are pro-war.
[02:31:53.186 --> 02:31:54.187]  This is the Washington Post.
[02:31:54.867 --> 02:31:59.590]  Republicans used to back Ukraine, then came middle fingers in Alabama.
[02:32:00.131 --> 02:32:02.632]  Like, oh, those rednecks in Alabama don't like war.
[02:32:02.932 --> 02:32:04.673]  Well, okay, wouldn't that be a good thing?
[02:32:06.535 --> 02:32:15.100]  So the rednecks in Alabama have more common sense and general geopolitical knowledge than your average Ivy League liberal, huh?
[02:32:16.781 --> 02:32:17.062]  Nice.
[02:32:18.322 --> 02:32:19.083]  But that's funny.
[02:32:20.933 --> 02:32:28.156]  The middle fingers in Alabama, ha ha ha, stupid rednecks don't like war, says the limousine liberal.
[02:32:30.798 --> 02:32:32.758]  It's not about Ukraine, it's about war.
[02:32:33.239 --> 02:32:38.381]  It's about the military-industrial complex, and the Republican voters have woken up to the game.
[02:32:40.142 --> 02:32:49.766]   That's why the new Republican Party that's being forced into existence by the Republican voters And it's more just common sense.
[02:32:49.986 --> 02:33:02.871]  It might not even be a geopolitical or a war thing, it's... How is it we have hundreds of billions of dollars for Ukraine, and yet we can't secure the border, and yet the average American now lives paycheck to paycheck?
[02:33:02.891 --> 02:33:04.112]  That's just common sense stuff!
[02:33:04.412 --> 02:33:06.133]  You don't even need advanced geopolitical knowledge!
[02:33:06.153 --> 02:33:08.974]  You don't even need to understand or care about what's going on in Ukraine!
[02:33:09.714 --> 02:33:13.056]  That's basic... common sense.
[02:33:17.472 --> 02:33:18.293]  That's basic.
[02:33:21.697 --> 02:33:27.403]  The need to exist and not have your life threatened.
[02:33:30.045 --> 02:33:30.846]  That's all that is.
[02:33:33.309 --> 02:33:35.631]  Liberals don't seem to get it though, isn't that funny?
[02:33:36.953 --> 02:33:37.714]  They never do!
[02:33:39.377 --> 02:33:41.898]  They all have their Ukraine flags in their bio.
[02:33:42.138 --> 02:33:44.980]  All the Democrats wear the Ukraine flag on their lapel pin.
[02:33:45.260 --> 02:33:46.100]  This is heavy stuff.
[02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:47.261]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:33:47.281 --> 02:33:51.243]  This is heavy stuff.
[02:33:51.263 --> 02:33:52.463]  But right there on the screen?
[02:33:52.483 --> 02:33:56.225]  That's the state capitol.
[02:33:56.345 --> 02:33:57.065]  That's the U.S.
[02:33:58.146 --> 02:33:58.646]  Congress.
[02:33:59.727 --> 02:34:02.168]  That's where the threats to our country exist.
[02:34:03.168 --> 02:34:04.429]  Not on the other side of the planet.
[02:34:05.249 --> 02:34:06.630]  Right there in Washington D.C.
[02:34:08.331 --> 02:34:13.235]  And most of them occupied the Democrat Party and wear Ukraine flag lapel pins.
[02:34:14.375 --> 02:34:15.076]  They let you know.
[02:34:16.557 --> 02:34:17.438]  They let you know.
[02:34:19.159 --> 02:34:23.582]  Well, there's other wars that are now going on because of the weakness of the Biden administration.
[02:34:26.324 --> 02:34:29.306]  And that would be now in Israel and the Gaza Strip.
[02:34:31.108 --> 02:35:05.571]   And I think, I don't know the number of countries now that have made statements condemning the genocide in the Gaza Strip but that number continues to rise as the deaths of Palestinians continue to rise as well and you can't even have an honest conversation about that without people getting all defensive and you can't even have a real conversation about that because nobody wants to address the origins of it
[02:35:07.512 --> 02:35:11.435]  On October 7th, when the IDF stood down.
[02:35:13.177 --> 02:35:16.740]  So you can say, well look, this is a self-defense, this is a war, this is a reaction.
[02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:23.886]  Okay, well, even if you just pose that as a hypothetical, well what if the IDF did stand down?
[02:35:23.946 --> 02:35:29.490]  What if Netanyahu wanted that to happen so that he could launch this and build the legacy of Israel conquering the Gaza Strip?
[02:35:30.431 --> 02:35:31.412]  Would you still support it then?
[02:35:31.652 --> 02:35:32.533]  Just a hypothetical.
[02:35:36.092 --> 02:35:37.412]  So, this is some of the latest.
[02:35:37.893 --> 02:35:44.894]  More than 100 killed as Israeli forces open fire in chaos at Gaza food lines, Palestinian Health Ministry says.
[02:35:45.174 --> 02:35:51.636]  Now look, I don't take anything at face value.
[02:35:53.337 --> 02:35:57.078]  So I can look on one side of the aisle and there's all the war propaganda from Israel.
[02:35:57.178 --> 02:36:02.659]  I can look at the other side of the aisle and there's all the war propaganda from Palestinians.
[02:36:04.500 --> 02:36:13.936]   But at some point, You compare and contrast the two and your instincts start to take you in a certain situation.
[02:36:14.596 --> 02:36:17.196]  And really, the Israelis don't even hide it, folks.
[02:36:18.276 --> 02:36:19.037]  They don't hide it.
[02:36:21.077 --> 02:36:35.300]  The Israeli soldiers go and bomb the entire Gaza Strip and then they make posts on social media laughing with the children's clothes and the children's toys and their little toy compartments and their toy chests and they think it's funny.
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:40.562]  So it's, I don't have to sit here and like, have a conspiracy theory.
[02:36:40.642 --> 02:36:43.143]  Oh look, the Israeli defense thinks it's funny they're killing kids.
[02:36:44.003 --> 02:36:45.424]  They brag about it, they post about it.
[02:36:47.825 --> 02:36:49.906]  It's celebrated in Israel when they do this.
[02:36:51.847 --> 02:36:52.747]  There's other videos.
[02:36:53.628 --> 02:36:55.989]  Again, you can say it's propaganda.
[02:36:56.029 --> 02:36:59.830]  Well, okay, what about the beheaded kid story that then they admit never even happened?
[02:37:01.111 --> 02:37:03.292]  What about the images they put out and then they admit it was AI?
[02:37:06.658 --> 02:37:14.600]  Yeah, there's videos where you have people in the Gaza Strip getting the food from the food line and then running back to shelter for their lives.
[02:37:15.500 --> 02:37:16.441]  Sometimes they don't make it.
[02:37:19.641 --> 02:37:21.582]  But here's, again, here's the problem.
[02:37:22.102 --> 02:37:22.882]  It's the same thing.
[02:37:23.282 --> 02:37:25.043]  Whether I'm pro-Russia or anti-Russia.
[02:37:25.243 --> 02:37:27.183]  Whether I'm pro-Israel or anti-Israel.
[02:37:27.684 --> 02:37:28.744]  I'm anti-war.
[02:37:28.884 --> 02:37:30.024]  I'm anti-death.
[02:37:31.565 --> 02:37:33.045]  It's all unnecessary.
[02:37:35.865 --> 02:37:40.328]  Iran greenlights massive Hezbollah attack on Israel, Arabic report says.
[02:37:42.389 --> 02:37:51.794]  So folks, every day that this assault in Gaza continues, every day it gets more dangerous.
[02:37:52.675 --> 02:37:55.977]  Not just for the people in the Gaza Strip, but for the people in Israel as well.
[02:37:59.539 --> 02:38:12.654]   It's the same story, whether it's Russia and Ukraine, or Israel-Palestine, Every day the bloodshed continues, it exponentially gets more dangerous for everybody.
[02:38:14.116 --> 02:38:16.839]  No matter what your opinion is, no matter what side of the aisle you're on.
[02:38:18.341 --> 02:38:19.782]  Every day it gets more dangerous.
[02:38:20.823 --> 02:38:24.407]  And by the way, it never makes the news, but there's...
[02:38:26.203 --> 02:38:30.404]  Former top Israeli generals that talk and they say, this is psychotic what we're doing.
[02:38:30.824 --> 02:38:32.725]  We're asking for Iran to start a war with us.
[02:38:32.945 --> 02:38:36.466]  We're asking for the Arab nations in the Middle East to start wars with us.
[02:38:36.606 --> 02:38:37.626]  What are we doing?
[02:38:38.946 --> 02:38:43.668]  There are voices of common sense, but they don't get played, just like Colonel Douglas MacGregor.
[02:38:46.769 --> 02:38:51.670]  His interviews get millions of views with Judge Napolitano and Natalie Brunel.
[02:38:52.799 --> 02:38:57.343]  And other places that will actually hear from Colonel Douglas McGregor, but he doesn't get on the mainstream news, does he?
[02:38:57.583 --> 02:38:58.644]  Because he's anti-war!
[02:39:00.465 --> 02:39:03.668]  Same thing goes with the Israeli generals that are anti-war.
[02:39:06.911 --> 02:39:12.195]  It's amazing how the message of anti-war doesn't get on mainstream news.
[02:39:12.235 --> 02:39:18.921]  I guess they all... I guess they all have stock portfolios with the weapons contractors and manufacturers, don't they?
[02:39:20.578 --> 02:39:24.261]  I guess they're all bought and paid for by the war lobby and the war racket.
[02:39:26.643 --> 02:39:49.670]   So put aside your opinions, pro-Russia, anti-Russia, pro-Israel, anti-Israel, that every day these wars continue, every day there's more bloodshed, we get closer to larger wars, world wars, and exponentially that threat of more bloodshed gets worse.
[02:39:49.851 --> 02:39:56.256]  Whether you're in Israel, whether you're in Ukraine, or anywhere else.
[02:39:58.858 --> 02:40:02.501]  And to not understand that and not want to put a stop to that is truly psychotic.
[02:40:04.463 --> 02:40:19.194]   Here's an interesting moment from a veteran talking about war In front of his city council in clip 6.
[02:40:19.394 --> 02:40:22.916]  My name is Alan Shabarro.
[02:40:23.837 --> 02:40:25.317]  I was with 3rd Special Forces Group.
[02:40:26.518 --> 02:40:28.600]  I was with the Commanders in Extremist Force with B-2-3.
[02:40:28.660 --> 02:40:31.261]  I was a sniper, assaulter, and a breacher.
[02:40:32.742 --> 02:40:34.243]  I did three rotations, 2008, 2009, and 2007.
[02:40:34.323 --> 02:40:34.704]  I know war.
[02:40:34.523 --> 02:40:45.882]   2009 and 2007. I know war. What's going on in Palestine right now is not a war. It is
[02:40:45.882 --> 02:40:54.483]   the humanization, it's the genocide, it's the ethnic cleansing of a specific people
[02:40:54.483 --> 02:40:55.483]  to take their land.
[02:40:55.483 --> 02:40:57.543]   *sounds of a car crashing* This is wrong.
[02:40:58.464 --> 02:41:01.747]  And there's nothing more American than speaking out against what's wrong.
[02:41:03.028 --> 02:41:06.591]  The US taxpayer is paying for this, which makes it even more frustrating.
[02:41:07.551 --> 02:41:08.672]  This needs to stop.
[02:41:10.414 --> 02:41:11.875]  This needs to stop.
[02:41:13.376 --> 02:41:17.905]   Whatever you can do, Anything.
[02:41:17.744 --> 02:41:19.744]  This needs to stop.
[02:41:19.744 --> 02:41:24.744]  Please fire him now.
[02:41:24.744 --> 02:41:27.744]  And again, this is a stance of common sense.
[02:41:27.730 --> 02:41:29.111]  This is a stance of anti-war.
[02:41:29.191 --> 02:41:31.933]  It's not pro or anti any nation, state, or people.
[02:41:32.753 --> 02:41:33.754]  But it gets spun that way.
[02:41:35.154 --> 02:41:36.495]  There's all these groups.
[02:41:38.236 --> 02:42:08.211]   And I mean, the truth is, it is The political left, mostly, and they've always been, you can call it anti-Israel or pro-Palestinian, whatever you want, but no, the truth is you have all these groups, and they are leftists, that, well I shouldn't say groups, but there's restaurants or business fronts or whatever, it's in New York City, it's in Europe, and they put up signs on their storefront, they put up signs on their restaurant, and it says,
[02:42:09.437 --> 02:42:11.058]  It just says ceasefire now.
[02:42:11.899 --> 02:42:12.620]  That's all it says.
[02:42:13.540 --> 02:42:18.224]  It just has a Palestinian flag and an Israeli flag and it just says ceasefire now.
[02:42:19.185 --> 02:42:24.829]  And these Jewish groups go around and they take pictures of it and they say, look at this business, they're anti-Semitic.
[02:42:26.110 --> 02:42:27.571]  How is that anti-Semitic?
[02:42:28.471 --> 02:42:35.832]   That's a strange admission to claim that that's anti-semitic to call for a ceasefire.
[02:42:35.832 --> 02:42:49.092]   Again, and there seems to be no effort to stop any of this, and all the voices that are trying to stop this get drowned
[02:42:49.092 --> 02:42:49.431]  out.
[02:42:49.671 --> 02:42:52.832]  The military-industrial complex just keeps winning.
[02:42:54.572 --> 02:43:06.436]  By the way, one of the GILTI members, Lloyd Austin, had a hearing today, and I'm talking to Ivan Reikland right now, and I'm going to get him to join us in about 15 minutes.
[02:43:06.456 --> 02:43:10.378]  He was at the hearing, and there were some powerful moments, so we're going to have an update from that.
[02:43:11.548 --> 02:43:12.969]  A couple other things here.
[02:43:12.989 --> 02:43:15.831]  Why are U.S.
[02:43:15.871 --> 02:43:17.472]  drones getting misidentified?
[02:43:17.492 --> 02:43:18.513]  Something is going on here, folks.
[02:43:18.352 --> 02:43:23.271]   two missiles both failed to reach the target. Why are US drones getting
[02:43:23.271 --> 02:43:30.352]   misidentified? Something is going on here folks. Something not right is going on
[02:43:30.352 --> 02:43:37.672]   here. Remember how they let that drone attack Jordan and they said oh we
[02:43:37.672 --> 02:43:40.672]  thought it was a US drone?
[02:43:39.170 --> 02:43:42.172]  Now there's another drone they misidentify and they fire at it.
[02:43:42.352 --> 02:43:43.513]  What is going on?
[02:43:44.373 --> 02:43:45.354]  How is this happening?
[02:43:45.894 --> 02:43:48.016]  Somebody is trying to start these wars.
[02:43:48.196 --> 02:43:50.978]  Somebody is trying to instigate more bloodshed.
[02:43:54.760 --> 02:44:07.356]   How do you have With the greatest technology on the planet, the most advanced war machines and communications on the planet, and we can't even identify drones?
[02:44:08.497 --> 02:44:11.038]  No, something else is going on here.
[02:44:11.298 --> 02:44:16.379]  Or maybe it's all the diversity and equity and inclusion people that they have running it and they just don't know up from down, left from right.
[02:44:16.419 --> 02:44:17.840]  They're just liberal retards.
[02:44:20.379 --> 02:44:26.704]  Army National Guard hit with aviation safety stand down after two crashes.
[02:44:27.204 --> 02:44:38.812]  So again, is this just more of the liberal diversity, equity and inclusion and now helicopters and planes are crashing everywhere because they put a bunch of leftist r-tards out there that don't even know what they're doing but they have the right skin color or whatever?
[02:44:39.773 --> 02:44:47.038]  Or the right, they like to put their mail members in exit holes and so they get a job they don't belong in?
[02:44:47.318 --> 02:44:48.359]  Is that what's going on with that?
[02:44:51.064 --> 02:44:51.524]  Yikes!
[02:44:53.305 --> 02:44:56.025]  They can't, yeah, diversity, equity, and inclusion.
[02:44:56.085 --> 02:44:57.326]  Diversity, inclusion, and equity.
[02:44:57.406 --> 02:44:57.826]  Die!
[02:44:58.426 --> 02:45:00.066]  Because that's the result.
[02:45:00.366 --> 02:45:01.106]  You die.
[02:45:03.727 --> 02:45:04.287]  You die.
[02:45:07.308 --> 02:45:08.068]  Boy, oh boy.
[02:45:09.148 --> 02:45:11.549]  There's a bunch of other news and developments we have here.
[02:45:12.970 --> 02:45:18.254]  Like Attorney General of Texas Ken Paxton sues Frisco ISD for illegally electioneering.
[02:45:18.694 --> 02:45:21.396]  Who do you think they were illegally electioneering for, by the way?
[02:45:22.457 --> 02:45:24.358]  Republicans or Democrats?
[02:45:25.699 --> 02:45:28.581]  I bet you'd feel confident betting your entire life savings on it.
[02:45:29.722 --> 02:45:32.664]  I bet you'd be confident betting your house on it.
[02:45:35.025 --> 02:45:40.089]  Who do you think schools in Texas were electioneering for?
[02:45:40.309 --> 02:45:41.430]  But it's all the same thing.
[02:45:43.656 --> 02:45:50.481]  All the gay propaganda, LGBTQ+, Black Lives Matter propaganda, that's all Democrat Party propaganda.
[02:45:50.561 --> 02:45:52.202]  That's all Democrat Party electioneering.
[02:45:52.362 --> 02:45:52.982]  That's all it is.
[02:45:53.423 --> 02:45:59.247]  They set up the straw man, and then they say, see, you're a good person, you support this group or that group.
[02:45:59.867 --> 02:46:02.809]  Oh, and now, look, see, Republicans don't like these groups.
[02:46:03.029 --> 02:46:04.510]  It's all Democrat Party propaganda.
[02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:08.673]  It's like a nice little political game of t-ball that they play.
[02:46:12.398 --> 02:46:16.021]  Attorney General Ken Paxton also hit the Democrats and won in court.
[02:46:16.522 --> 02:46:20.305]  Democrats unconstitutionally spent $1.7 trillion.
[02:46:21.506 --> 02:46:27.352]  Court says Democrats who broke quorum rules unconstitutionally spent $1.7 trillion.
[02:46:27.952 --> 02:46:31.816]  Now you see why they came so hard for Ken Paxton, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:33.507 --> 02:46:36.468]  Now you see why they came so hard for Ken Paxton.
[02:46:37.188 --> 02:46:42.730]  Because he's likely the best Attorney General we have in the United States of America.
[02:46:44.170 --> 02:46:48.672]  It's likely he is the best Attorney General we have in the United States of America.
[02:46:48.531 --> 02:46:52.652]  He needs to be protected at all costs.
[02:46:52.652 --> 02:46:58.370]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:46:58.370 --> 02:47:02.611]  Well, I have had a loaded news transmission today.
[02:47:02.611 --> 02:47:09.611]   And quite frankly, I'm going to get myself in trouble here, because I've barely plugged and folks, we got to pay some
[02:47:09.611 --> 02:47:10.250]  bills.
[02:47:10.442 --> 02:47:11.483]  So I'm desperate.
[02:47:11.543 --> 02:47:12.844]  I need you to save my ass here.
[02:47:13.244 --> 02:47:19.348]  I've been so focused on covering the news that I've barely even plugged today and I'm going to get myself in some trouble.

[02:47:42.456 --> 02:47:45.880]  I mean, one of the top trends right now is energy drinks.
[02:47:47.208 --> 02:47:55.250]  And so you can go to the grocery store or you can go to the gas station and they got coolers full of these energy drinks and they're toxic.
[02:47:55.330 --> 02:47:56.690]  They're filled with processed sugar.
[02:47:56.750 --> 02:47:58.291]  They're filled with high fructose corn syrup.
[02:47:58.311 --> 02:47:59.051]  It's not good for you.
[02:47:59.451 --> 02:48:00.991]  Plus they taste like battery acid.
[02:48:01.531 --> 02:48:05.072]  And maybe you get an hour, maybe two, and then you crash when it comes to the energy.
[02:48:05.892 --> 02:48:08.533]  TurboForcePlus, InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:48:12.594 --> 02:48:15.275]  Ten hours of clean energy in one scoop.
[02:48:15.575 --> 02:48:16.395]  That's the real deal.

[02:48:19.128 --> 02:48:22.292]  So, stop drinking the toxic energy drinks.
[02:48:23.253 --> 02:48:25.195]  Stop putting that poison into your body.
[02:48:26.237 --> 02:48:27.678]  Get 10 hours of clean energy.
[02:48:28.239 --> 02:48:28.780]  One scoop.

[02:48:43.725 --> 02:48:46.127]  I've been so focused on the news and I've really dropped the ball.
[02:48:46.227 --> 02:48:47.147]  I've really blown it bad.
[02:48:47.247 --> 02:48:51.470]  And it's already when Alex is not here hosting, we already don't get as much people shopping.
[02:48:51.510 --> 02:48:52.630]  So I need you to do me a favor.
[02:48:52.911 --> 02:48:54.411]  Go do some shopping at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:48:58.991 --> 02:49:00.232]  I'm going to take a quick break.
[02:49:00.632 --> 02:49:09.676]  I'm going to get my guest lined up and I'm also going to show you even more corruption from the Democrats.
[02:49:09.896 --> 02:49:15.179]  They literally have a pay-for-play gangster mafia situation going on in California.
[02:49:15.759 --> 02:49:16.640]  That's all coming up next.
[02:49:16.660 --> 02:49:17.200]  We'll be right back.
[02:49:19.315 --> 02:49:23.157]  First came Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Super Mario Brothers.
[02:49:23.757 --> 02:49:27.118]  And now, the ultimate retro nostalgia throwback game.
[02:49:27.758 --> 02:49:34.141]  I present to the world, Alex Jones's New World Order Wars!
[02:49:34.681 --> 02:49:36.402]  They're turning the friggin' frogs gay!
[02:49:37.042 --> 02:49:38.943]  I'll eat your ass!
[02:49:39.043 --> 02:49:40.063]  You Nazi scum!
[02:49:41.844 --> 02:49:44.505]  Let's free the patriots and defeat the globalist techies.
[02:49:45.945 --> 02:49:49.575]  We are going to defeat the globalists very bigly.
[02:49:50.277 --> 02:49:52.277]  This game is mostly peaceful.
[02:49:52.277 --> 02:49:54.277]  [Gunshots]
[02:49:54.277 --> 02:49:56.277]  [Screaming]
[02:49:56.277 --> 02:49:58.277]  [Screaming]
[02:49:58.277 --> 02:50:00.277]  [Screaming]
[02:50:00.277 --> 02:50:02.277]  I'm going to lower the world's population.
[02:50:02.277 --> 02:50:04.277]  [Laughing]
[02:50:04.410 --> 02:50:07.253]  Oh, Big Bill, I'm taking you down, rapist.
[02:50:07.434 --> 02:50:10.977]  I did not have sexual relations with that saxophone.
[02:50:11.237 --> 02:50:18.384]  Download it now at AlexJonesGame.com, because as we all know, anything badass gets censored!
[02:50:19.746 --> 02:50:20.587]  Good evening, everybody.
[02:50:23.647 --> 02:50:24.688]  There's not even the same universe.
[02:50:24.728 --> 02:50:28.369]  I mean, she is an abject, psychopathic demon from hell.
[02:50:28.530 --> 02:50:35.653]  People around her say she's so dark now, and so evil, and so possessed that they are having nightmares.
[02:50:35.973 --> 02:50:36.774]  They're freaking out.
[02:50:36.773 --> 02:50:40.773]   Folks, they say, "Listen, Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur."
[02:50:41.773 --> 02:50:48.773]   Whiskey bottles and brand new cars, Oak tree, you're in my way.
[02:50:48.773 --> 02:50:53.773]  There's too much coke and too much smoke.
[02:50:53.696 --> 02:50:55.977]  I have two words for you.
[02:50:55.858 --> 02:50:57.858]  inside you.
[02:50:57.858 --> 02:50:59.858]  What's different at this point, Doug, than me?
[02:50:59.858 --> 02:51:01.858]  Ooh, that smell.
[02:51:01.858 --> 02:51:03.858]  I have two words for you.
[02:51:03.858 --> 02:51:05.858]  Can't you smell that smell?
[02:51:05.858 --> 02:51:07.858]  But you're drunk.
[02:51:07.858 --> 02:51:09.858]  Ooh, that smell.
[02:51:09.858 --> 02:51:11.858]  [laughter]
[02:51:12.494 --> 02:51:14.515]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[02:51:14.595 --> 02:51:16.395]  He said we smell like sulfur.
[02:51:16.515 --> 02:51:18.116]  Ain't that something?
[02:51:18.136 --> 02:51:19.836]  I'm not just being tacky.
[02:51:19.876 --> 02:51:23.578]  Call me Margaret Mead and Samoa.
[02:51:23.897 --> 02:51:30.897]  I'm not just being tacky, call me Margaret Mead and Samoa.
[02:51:30.897 --> 02:51:32.897]  I had never seen or smelled any woman like that.
[02:51:32.897 --> 02:51:50.897]  [Music]
[02:51:50.897 --> 02:51:54.897]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:51:54.897 --> 02:51:56.897]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:51:56.897 --> 02:52:03.897]  [Music]
[02:52:03.897 --> 02:52:06.897]  Alright, let's lighten it up for a little bit here.
[02:52:07.469 --> 02:52:12.590]  Before we're joined by Ivan Reikland with what went down with Lloyd Austin today in a hearing.
[02:52:14.281 --> 02:52:17.743]  First, let's go, this is just the nature of the American left.
[02:52:17.763 --> 02:52:19.304]  They're completely psychotic.
[02:52:19.604 --> 02:52:23.867]  And all you have to do is just make an innocuous purchase on the internet to find out.
[02:52:24.327 --> 02:52:31.611]  Here's Roman Sharf, the CEO of Luxury Bazaar, who just wanted to buy some Trump shoes, and then all of a sudden he became a Russian agent overnight!
[02:52:33.252 --> 02:52:33.432]  So.
[02:52:34.513 --> 02:52:35.374]  Bought a pair of sneakers.
[02:52:36.674 --> 02:52:37.195]  These sneakers.
[02:52:38.115 --> 02:52:41.797]  And apparently, they made me a Russian oligarch overnight.
[02:52:42.238 --> 02:52:42.618]  Here's how.
[02:52:45.080 --> 02:52:47.382]  Guys, I'm a sneakerhead.
[02:52:47.402 --> 02:52:48.943]  I'm also a U.S.
[02:52:49.003 --> 02:52:49.663]  Army veteran.
[02:52:49.964 --> 02:52:51.625]  And yes, I am a Republican.
[02:52:52.205 --> 02:52:58.129]  The title of the article read, a Russian oligarch spends $9,000 on sneakers to support Trump.
[02:52:59.109 --> 02:53:02.652]  Sounds sketchy, but I actually came from Ukraine.
[02:53:03.450 --> 02:53:05.173]  At the time I was part of the Soviet Union.
[02:53:05.633 --> 02:53:09.539]  I came here at the age of 13 as a refugee when my dad had $4 in his pocket.
[02:53:09.579 --> 02:53:18.372]  I busted my ass working every dirty job under the sun to get where I am today in order to be able to afford to buy these $9,000 pair of collectible sneakers.
[02:53:18.932 --> 02:53:19.293]  But I guess...
[02:53:20.270 --> 02:53:29.575]  The headline of Russian refugee, Ukrainian refugee, or perhaps maybe just a man, that would not get as many clicks as a Russian oligarch.
[02:53:30.216 --> 02:53:39.942]  I even saw a tweet from a Ukrainian patriot that said, a Russian shady watch dealer bought $9,000 pair of sneakers as a way to move money to Russia somehow.
[02:53:40.622 --> 02:53:55.065]   Of course, I kindly asked the author to check the fact that My own charity raised over a quarter million dollars of aid to Ukraine since that war has started before putting out accusations of stupid tweets, if you will.
[02:53:55.717 --> 02:53:58.198]  I wasn't trying to make a political statement by buying these shoes.
[02:53:58.338 --> 02:54:00.459]  Of course, the internet blew up.
[02:54:00.579 --> 02:54:09.703]  I'm getting comments and messages from on IG from people saying, oh, I am no longer following you or I'm unfollowing you because you are a Trump supporter and I'm no longer doing business with you.
[02:54:09.743 --> 02:54:10.143]  It's funny.
[02:54:10.383 --> 02:54:10.863]  Here I am.
[02:54:10.983 --> 02:54:11.683]  Maybe I'm silly.
[02:54:11.883 --> 02:54:20.567]  I thought that people done business with Luxury Bazaar because we've been in business for 21 years because of trust, because of personalized customer service that we provide in great pricing.
[02:54:20.667 --> 02:54:22.788]  But I guess I was wrong.
[02:54:23.373 --> 02:54:33.117]  You know what sags me the most about this whole situation is that over something as stupid as a pair of sneakers, it showed me so clearly, once again, on just how divided our country is.
[02:54:33.818 --> 02:54:42.141]  With that said, guys, there's not a mean tweet in the world, there's not an IG post, there's not a news article that's going to stop me from being aware.
[02:54:43.422 --> 02:54:48.125]  You're a veteran, you're even from Ukraine, you buy a pair of Trump sneakers and all of a sudden you're a Russian oligarch.
[02:54:48.165 --> 02:54:50.246]  It just shows how insane and psychotic the left is.
[02:54:50.506 --> 02:54:51.467]  So keep it up, liberals.
[02:54:51.707 --> 02:54:54.349]  You're just showing more people that you're the problem with everything.
[02:54:55.089 --> 02:54:56.250]  And then here's Fat Joe!
[02:54:56.910 --> 02:55:00.472]  Famous rapper, musician Fat Joe had to get himself a pair too.
[02:55:00.311 --> 02:55:01.311]  Here's what he had to say.
[02:55:01.311 --> 02:55:09.031]  I had to find these.
[02:55:09.031 --> 02:55:11.791]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:55:11.559 --> 02:55:16.199]   Now the mayor's gonna call Everybody's gonna call me.
[02:55:16.219 --> 02:55:17.961]  They say, you're wildin' out, Joe.
[02:55:18.942 --> 02:55:20.183]  Why you got the trunk?
[02:55:20.203 --> 02:55:21.324]  Look, man, it's the first one.
[02:55:22.184 --> 02:55:25.347]  Joe, you... I'm a sneaker collector.
[02:55:25.367 --> 02:55:28.790]  I don't know what none of these guys did.
[02:55:30.492 --> 02:55:31.733]  I collect sneakers.
[02:55:32.253 --> 02:55:34.253]  The rarer the better!
[02:55:34.253 --> 02:55:41.053]  No, I didn't pay for these sneakers.
[02:55:39.319 --> 02:55:41.319]  No, I didn't pay for these sneakers.
[02:55:41.319 --> 02:55:43.319]  Sorry.
[02:55:43.319 --> 02:55:46.520]  I didn't pay for these things.
[02:55:46.520 --> 02:55:50.819]   They knew I had to have because I'm the biggest in the game.
[02:55:50.819 --> 02:55:57.519]  So what I do is collect.
[02:55:57.519 --> 02:56:01.219]  But no, Fat Joe's a Russian oligarch now.
[02:56:01.215 --> 02:56:02.295]  He got Trump sneakers.
[02:56:02.656 --> 02:56:04.137]  Hey, I got some good news for everybody.

[02:57:06.085 --> 02:57:08.804]  sometimes we let things slip through the crack.
[02:57:08.804 --> 02:57:10.804]  So I'm going to try to not let that happen.
[02:57:10.804 --> 02:57:15.804]   Lloyd Austin had a hearing today and there were a bunch of interesting moments.
[02:57:16.385 --> 02:57:22.247]  Ivan Reikland was there confronting him, and then, I mean, folks, the guy's literally on a bad leg.
[02:57:22.467 --> 02:57:28.190]  He's gimping around with a cane, and he's still not letting the deep state rest easy.
[02:57:28.250 --> 02:57:29.851]  He's still out there putting in the work.
[02:57:29.891 --> 02:57:31.992]  Former Green Beret, Ivan Reikland, joins me.
[02:57:32.072 --> 02:57:36.774]  Ivan, we got the three clips you sent me, too, so feel free, if you want to mention those and pitch those, we can go to those.
[02:57:37.595 --> 02:57:40.236]  But briefly, what was this hearing about today?
[02:57:40.336 --> 02:57:41.937]  Why were you at the U.S.
[02:57:41.957 --> 02:57:42.337]  Capitol?
[02:57:44.011 --> 02:57:45.353]  Yes, two different things.
[02:57:45.373 --> 02:58:01.171]  The reason why he was there at the hearing is because the House Armed Services Committee Chairman, Congressman, he's a total scum rhino, Mike Rogers, basically called him in to make it look like kabuki theater that they're going to try to hold Lloyd Austin to account for being derelict in duty and being AWOL.
[02:58:01.231 --> 02:58:06.846]   Remember at the time when he was the January 1st when people were like, what's going on?
[02:58:06.886 --> 02:58:07.546]  Where is this guy?
[02:58:07.606 --> 02:58:16.254]  And supposedly he was going through surgery and it wasn't until a couple of days later that he had notified his chain of command that he was, I guess, in Walter Reed.
[02:58:16.914 --> 02:58:28.104]  So while three wars are brewing basically within the Department of Defense and he's enforcing this illegal DoD COVID jab mandate, he's out there essentially unaccounted for.
[02:58:28.584 --> 02:58:38.732]   And the reason why I was there is specifically Due to the fact that he did implement the illegal COVID mandate, I'm one of the 231 that signed on to the Declaration of Military Accountability.
[02:58:39.012 --> 02:58:43.713]  Tucker Carlson aired that interview with Brad Miller, who's one of the co-signers of that declaration.
[02:58:44.314 --> 02:58:46.895]  And I wanted to apply a little bit of pressure in person right there.
[02:58:46.935 --> 02:58:50.876]  I sat next to him about, I don't know, 5-10 feet away off to his right.
[02:58:51.316 --> 02:58:59.439]  And so I definitely wanted to provide him this book to read, which is the summary of the illegal DoD COVID mandate.
[02:59:00.094 --> 02:59:02.277]  Also, the Declaration of Military Accountability.
[02:59:02.677 --> 02:59:06.021]  I wanted to give him two copies of different articles written by Brad Miller.
[02:59:06.341 --> 02:59:08.644]  The only path to healthy military and then moral injury.
[02:59:09.124 --> 02:59:11.227]  And at the very end, he refused to accept it.
[02:59:11.267 --> 02:59:12.989]  I don't know if you want to play that particular clip.
[02:59:13.009 --> 02:59:20.758]  Yeah, here's Ivan Richland at the beginning of the hearing, as he said, reading this to one Lloyd Austin.
[02:59:23.208 --> 02:59:30.511]  And then the path to healthy military by acknowledgement, accountability, and restitution of the COVID-19 vaccine mandates harms.
[02:59:31.511 --> 02:59:35.453]  So you talked about doing an AAR about what your decision making process was with your health.
[02:59:36.453 --> 02:59:44.496]  I'd offer you and suggest to you to do the same thing related to the illegal Department of Defense DOD jab mandate.
[02:59:45.956 --> 02:59:54.663]   And that's why we have this problem with our military Because a lot of us left because of the illegal mandate.
[02:59:56.504 --> 03:00:00.146]  Emergency use authorized products are not allowed to be mandated.
[03:00:00.206 --> 03:00:01.126]  I'm running away like a coward.
[03:00:01.146 --> 03:00:05.408]  Forced experimentation on the force is illegal and you will be held to account.
[03:00:05.548 --> 03:00:06.949]  I guarantee it personally.
[03:00:07.829 --> 03:00:12.251]  So there's Lloyd Austin running away like a coward and I know we have more clips of that as well.
[03:00:12.371 --> 03:00:15.152]  Yeah, that was the very end of the actual hearing.
[03:00:15.172 --> 03:00:19.174]  He was only there for two hours but not all members of Congress were able to engage with him.
[03:00:19.959 --> 03:00:24.820]  But I said, it's my birthday today, on Leap Day, can I offer you a gift?
[03:00:24.900 --> 03:00:26.140]  And it was essentially this package.
[03:00:26.200 --> 03:00:27.361]  You're Leap Day William?
[03:00:28.881 --> 03:00:29.541]  Yeah, I am.
[03:00:29.681 --> 03:00:32.442]  You're Leap Day William, on the air, on Leap Day?
[03:00:32.542 --> 03:00:33.402]  Oh my gosh!
[03:00:33.762 --> 03:00:35.743]  That's right, I just turned 12 years old.
[03:00:37.323 --> 03:00:40.404]  A 12 year old with a bad leg and a cane.
[03:00:40.424 --> 03:00:44.044]  I mean, your service didn't stop when you left the military.
[03:00:44.064 --> 03:00:46.085]  You're still out there getting after it.
[03:00:47.185 --> 03:00:49.866]  Hey, Big Daddy Kane, you need to play some music in the background.
[03:00:50.366 --> 03:00:51.386]  Limping ain't easy.
[03:00:53.127 --> 03:00:56.168]  This is just, this guy just gets wilder every time.
[03:00:57.569 --> 03:00:58.949]  So he didn't want to hear from you there.
[03:00:58.969 --> 03:01:00.870]  You basically, you know, you read him.
[03:01:00.910 --> 03:01:03.731]  His security detail was kind of elbowing me out of there.
[03:01:03.771 --> 03:01:08.772]  I'm like, hey, buddy, you don't have jurisdiction to do anything other than protect your protectee.
[03:01:09.172 --> 03:01:16.175]  So kind of like step aside, protect him, and I'm going to go ahead and make my First Amendment sounds and keep running off.
[03:01:16.994 --> 03:01:18.535]  Let's go to the clip now.
[03:01:18.615 --> 03:01:19.356]  Here's Matt Gaetz.
[03:01:19.376 --> 03:01:20.157]  Let's go to the Gaetz clip.
[03:01:20.177 --> 03:01:21.257]  I want you to comment further.
[03:01:21.338 --> 03:01:23.299]  Here's Matt Gaetz talking to Lloyd Austin.
[03:01:24.440 --> 03:01:34.889]  You didn't tell the president that you had cancer, that you were being treated for cancer, or that the treatment for that cancer had gone wrong because you saw it as personal and medical.
[03:01:35.429 --> 03:01:37.891]  And I think a lot of us have empathy for you in that regard.
[03:01:38.411 --> 03:01:54.811]   But now that you see how personal medical decisions are, will you call for the re-recruitment Restoration of full rank and back pay for the 8,600 service members who were vax mandated out of the military.
[03:01:56.736 --> 03:01:57.437]  No, I won't.
[03:01:58.137 --> 03:02:02.280]  So, on March 4th, 2021, you authored a memo.
[03:02:02.340 --> 03:02:04.102]  It was entitled, Message to the Force.
[03:02:04.162 --> 03:02:13.268]  And in that memo, you said that there would be clear and swift accountability for anyone who didn't meet the highest standards of the Department of Defense.
[03:02:13.288 --> 03:02:18.172]  Now, however this worked out, we all acknowledge that what you did here didn't meet the highest standards, right?
[03:02:18.732 --> 03:02:19.353]  You made a mistake.
[03:02:20.513 --> 03:02:21.574]  I admit it too.
[03:02:21.594 --> 03:02:22.074]  So we got that.
[03:02:22.294 --> 03:02:27.618]  So then the question is what becomes the clear and swift accountability?
[03:02:27.678 --> 03:02:30.300]  Now, you're not going to be discharged, right?
[03:02:31.547 --> 03:02:31.707]  No?
[03:02:32.167 --> 03:02:32.548]  That's right.
[03:02:32.588 --> 03:02:37.310]  Okay, you're not going to be suspended, you're not going to be demoted, and you're not going to have your pay cut.
[03:02:37.410 --> 03:02:38.791]  None of those things are going to happen to you, right?
[03:02:39.191 --> 03:02:39.591]  That's right.
[03:02:39.692 --> 03:02:45.495]  Okay, so you come here seeking some grace and some forgiveness.
[03:02:46.115 --> 03:02:53.319]  And I want you to know that one of the service members, who you've axe-mandated out of the military, sent me the parable of the unforgiving debtor.
[03:02:53.719 --> 03:02:56.621]  And it's in the book of Matthew, it's verses 21 to 35.
[03:02:59.198 --> 03:03:04.932]  The man fell down before his king and begged him, please be patient with me and I will pay all the debt.
[03:03:05.534 --> 03:03:12.135]   Then his master, filled with pity, For him, released him, and forgave him of his debt.
[03:03:12.635 --> 03:03:16.999]  But when the man left the king, he went to a fellow servant who owed him a few thousand dollars.
[03:03:17.439 --> 03:03:20.242]  He grabbed him by the throat and demanded payment.
[03:03:20.722 --> 03:03:23.364]  His fellow servant sat down and begged him for a little more time.
[03:03:23.644 --> 03:03:26.106]  Be patient with me and I will pay it, he pleaded.
[03:03:26.707 --> 03:03:28.108]  But his creditor would not wait.
[03:03:28.709 --> 03:03:32.612]  He had the man arrested and put in prison until the debt could be paid in full.
[03:03:33.527 --> 03:03:35.589]  When some of the other servants saw this, they were very upset.
[03:03:35.629 --> 03:03:37.711]  They went to the king and told him everything that had happened.
[03:03:38.092 --> 03:03:45.680]  And the king called the man who had been forgiven and said, you evil servant, I forgave you that tremendous debt because you pleaded with me.
[03:03:46.280 --> 03:03:50.965]  Shouldn't you have mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?
[03:03:51.886 --> 03:03:57.709]  Then the Angry King sent the man to prison to be tortured until he had paid his entire debt.
[03:03:58.269 --> 03:04:03.432]  Mr. Secretary, you come to us seeking forgiveness, but you offer none.
[03:04:03.892 --> 03:04:06.814]  And it seems as though the pattern is repeated.
[03:04:07.294 --> 03:04:13.938]  You make a mistake, like on the VAX mandate and here regarding your notification, then you get busted.
[03:04:15.097 --> 03:04:19.719]  President Biden had to sign something into law reversing your VAX mandate.
[03:04:19.739 --> 03:04:24.240]  You got busted here, not because you came forward, but because we learned of this through other means.
[03:04:24.480 --> 03:04:31.163]  And then after you get busted making a mistake, you want that benefit, but you don't want to extend it to others.
[03:04:32.303 --> 03:04:33.624]  This isn't swift or clear.
[03:04:34.324 --> 03:04:37.645]  You're not meeting your own standards that you set for yourself.
[03:04:38.345 --> 03:04:42.817]   And you say that The DOD is a learning organization.
[03:04:43.558 --> 03:04:50.764]  Haven't you learned yet that the military is weaker, not stronger, with the 8,600 people that you've ex-mandated out of the military?
[03:04:52.725 --> 03:04:55.007]  Just one point, Congressman.
[03:04:55.027 --> 03:05:04.613]   The reason I'm here is because Chairman Requested that I appear to talk about the circumstances surrounding my hospitalization.
[03:05:04.633 --> 03:05:06.233]  But don't you see the hypocrisy in it?
[03:05:06.594 --> 03:05:14.197]  Because you screwed up, we fixed your screw up, and now you want grace, but these people who sought religious exemptions, they got no such grace.
[03:05:14.257 --> 03:05:20.661]  And also, I just think it's ridiculous that we're in three wars, you went AWOL for three days, and we get two hours with you.
[03:05:20.861 --> 03:05:25.403]  If you can't spend more than two hours answering these questions, I don't know how you really operate in all these wars.
[03:05:25.779 --> 03:05:32.045]  Alright, I want to get Ivan Reikland's response to that, and I'm also just going to say, Matt Gaetz, your Speaker of the House, please.
[03:05:33.025 --> 03:05:35.808]  But ladies and gentlemen, I just hit my fourth break of the show today.
[03:05:36.188 --> 03:05:36.889]  I barely plugged.

[03:05:41.693 --> 03:05:45.797]  I mean, I heard from Ivan like an hour ago, he's like, hey, there's this big news coming out of the Capitol, you gotta cover this.
[03:05:45.817 --> 03:05:47.799]  I said, Ivan, let's get you on, let's cover this, it's too important.
[03:05:48.399 --> 03:05:49.860]  Please, nobody else's car.
[03:05:49.880 --> 03:05:50.140]  I don't know.
[03:05:50.380 --> 03:05:53.062]  Maybe someone else will invite Ivan Reikland to come on air and cover this.
[03:05:53.102 --> 03:06:03.049]  Maybe someone else will give Ivan the airtime to talk about how he confronted peacefully, legally, lawfully with his First Amendment the corruption from the Biden Department of Defense Lloyd Austin.
[03:06:03.309 --> 03:06:04.510]  I don't know, but I know we did!
[03:06:04.870 --> 03:06:09.252]  And I know we will continue on this journey, so please continue to support us at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:06:23.640 --> 03:06:24.861]  Okay, Ivan.
[03:06:25.061 --> 03:06:26.642]  Matt Gaetz, Speaker of the House, please, next time.
[03:06:27.382 --> 03:06:28.483]  Let me do a quick plug.
[03:06:29.063 --> 03:06:34.294]   I only do interviews with those that have the courage And the fortitude to put out the truth.
[03:06:34.714 --> 03:06:42.441]  I only dedicate my time to folks like you, Owen, Alex, InfoWars, because you guys are taking a lot of the risk for a lot of the rest of us.
[03:06:42.461 --> 03:06:45.284]  So I'm honored to be in the fight with you on your guys' shelves.
[03:06:45.344 --> 03:06:47.305]  So yeah, please support you guys.
[03:06:47.486 --> 03:06:50.248]  Now, let's respond to Matt Gaetz there.
[03:06:50.709 --> 03:06:56.554]  And Lloyd Austin is like, well, you know, he's acting like, oh, I'm doing you a favor while being here.
[03:06:56.594 --> 03:06:57.314]  Does he forget that?
[03:06:57.455 --> 03:06:58.816]  Does he forget how things work here?
[03:07:00.558 --> 03:07:03.761]  No, this little kid is a treasonous punk.
[03:07:04.221 --> 03:07:06.443]  And that's probably in the last video that we're going to play.
[03:07:06.664 --> 03:07:34.533]   The bottom line here is, for those that don't know, if you haven't seen any of the interviews that Owen has done in the past related to those that signed on to this Declaration of Military Accountability, It was an illegal order to mandate an emergency use authorized product into the force that kicked out 8,500 plus, that forced 80,000 of us or so to leave early, and then probably at this point over a million service members regret being forced and duped and coerced.
[03:07:34.893 --> 03:07:35.553]  Let's go to you now.
[03:07:35.573 --> 03:07:39.475]  This is in the halls of the Capitol building when he was running away like a scared rat.
[03:07:39.855 --> 03:07:42.076]  Using your First Amendment in the proper way.
[03:07:41.895 --> 03:07:44.895]  still considers him as a respected leader.
[03:07:44.895 --> 03:07:48.774]   He needs to be thrown out to the curb, and then treason should basically
[03:07:48.774 --> 03:07:50.855]  follow immediately thereafter.
[03:07:50.855 --> 03:07:52.234]  Let's go to you now.
[03:07:52.234 --> 03:07:58.535]   This is in the halls of the Capitol building when he was running away like a scared rat,
[03:07:58.535 --> 03:08:00.695]  using your First Amendment in the proper way.
[03:08:00.695 --> 03:08:01.535]  Go ahead.
[03:08:01.535 --> 03:08:11.254]   Mr. Austin, how do you reconcile mandating this death jab on our military?
[03:08:11.254 --> 03:08:15.254]  [inaudible]
[03:08:15.317 --> 03:08:18.238]  Why did you mandate a death jab to the military?
[03:08:18.618 --> 03:08:19.558]  Are you pushing me, sir?
[03:08:19.858 --> 03:08:20.759]  I'm not doing anything.
[03:08:20.779 --> 03:08:21.639]  Why'd you just bump me?
[03:08:22.219 --> 03:08:23.519]  Why'd you just bump me, sir?
[03:08:23.959 --> 03:08:25.520]  Why'd you just physically bump me, sir?
[03:08:26.100 --> 03:08:28.981]  I'm not allowed to film in the halls of Congress, sir!
[03:08:30.861 --> 03:08:31.982]  Physically touching me!
[03:08:32.102 --> 03:08:33.002]  You're gonna assault me!
[03:08:34.411 --> 03:08:35.371]  You're gonna assault me!
[03:08:36.031 --> 03:08:36.952]  You don't even look at me!
[03:08:38.292 --> 03:08:40.472]  Punk!
[03:08:40.512 --> 03:08:42.593]  Look at him!
[03:08:42.953 --> 03:08:45.254]  Treasonous punk!
[03:08:45.754 --> 03:08:48.114]  Okay, I'm sorry, that was not Ivan Reikland.
[03:08:48.134 --> 03:08:54.476]  I'm guessing you're joining, now you're joined by the individual who had that excellent execution of his First Amendment right there.
[03:08:54.496 --> 03:08:56.516]  Suzanne Miller.
[03:08:56.856 --> 03:08:57.536]  How you doing, Owen?
[03:08:58.717 --> 03:09:02.598]  Well, okay, so what, the security there was trying to manhandle you a little bit?
[03:09:02.638 --> 03:09:03.398]  They can rough you up?
[03:09:05.051 --> 03:09:06.532]  Yeah, I was just asking questions.
[03:09:06.653 --> 03:09:10.576]  As you know, I've interviewed you on my Blood Money podcast, and we just go after the truth.
[03:09:10.596 --> 03:09:17.463]  So I tried to ask him some questions, and one of the security guys actually, like, really elbowed me right in the chest, you know, quite hard.
[03:09:18.383 --> 03:09:19.825]  And that's why I got in space.
[03:09:22.252 --> 03:09:23.734]  Here's the beauty of it, Owen.
[03:09:23.754 --> 03:09:24.875]  A lot of people don't understand.
[03:09:26.237 --> 03:09:32.323]  Those that are protecting the Secretary of Defense, they're only authorized to protect their protectee.
[03:09:32.644 --> 03:09:34.346]  They really don't have any arrest authority.
[03:09:34.646 --> 03:09:39.251]  So they can't really do anything unless you're physically kind of getting in the space of the Secretary.
[03:09:39.591 --> 03:09:41.493]  And we found out earlier that the U.S.
[03:09:41.513 --> 03:09:51.147]   Capitol Police officer that's here in the hallways of the Rayburn He said that he was approached by the Secretary of Defense's detail, and they showed him a picture of me, and he's like, yeah, I know that guy.
[03:09:51.187 --> 03:09:52.228]  He comes to every hearing.
[03:09:52.529 --> 03:09:54.191]  He always follows the rules.
[03:09:54.532 --> 03:10:03.404]   But yeah, Secretary Lloyd Austin, because, you know, what I put out on the internet, on X, They fear me, which is exactly what he needs to know because we're not going away.
[03:10:03.764 --> 03:10:17.295]  We're going to continue to escalate this First Amendment scrutiny of him until he's literally at a minimum in prison and we hold him to account for this illegal DoD COVID mandate that has just mutilated our national security and many members of our service.
[03:10:17.635 --> 03:10:19.637]  Okay, that's actually crazy.
[03:10:21.239 --> 03:10:22.441]  I've told this story before.
[03:10:22.461 --> 03:10:23.842]  I don't know if I've told this to you.
[03:10:24.523 --> 03:10:35.916]  When I got arrested at the Capitol in January of 2020, this was after I went into Jerry Nadler's fake impeachment scam against Donald Trump.
[03:10:35.936 --> 03:10:37.878]  Jerry Nadler's the criminal, not Trump, not me.
[03:10:39.109 --> 03:10:40.811]  I walked into the Capitol that day.
[03:10:40.831 --> 03:10:44.633]  I have multiple eyewitnesses that can tell this story.
[03:10:45.434 --> 03:10:47.075]  The Capitol Police stopped me.
[03:10:47.095 --> 03:10:50.417]  Keep in mind, I'm not a criminal, nothing like that.
[03:10:50.517 --> 03:10:52.159]  I'm just trying to walk into the Capitol.
[03:10:52.659 --> 03:10:59.044]  And the Capitol Police pulled me aside and they're like, uh, Owen, you know we have orders to arrest you.
[03:10:59.904 --> 03:11:02.026]  If you come in here and I'm like, what are you talking about?
[03:11:02.186 --> 03:11:02.906]  I can come in here.
[03:11:03.187 --> 03:11:07.010]  There's no, he's like, he's like, no, we we've been told to arrest you.
[03:11:07.130 --> 03:11:09.051]  If you come in here, don't come in here.
[03:11:09.071 --> 03:11:10.913]  We're going to, we're going to have to arrest you.
[03:11:11.333 --> 03:11:15.016]  And I'm like, no, first of all, I don't, there's no reason for you to arrest me.
[03:11:15.056 --> 03:11:16.077]  I'm going into the Capitol.
[03:11:16.377 --> 03:11:18.839]  And the guy was just like, so, I mean, I checked him on it.
[03:11:18.899 --> 03:11:20.240]  He knows there was no reason to arrest me.
[03:11:20.260 --> 03:11:23.283]  So he was like, oh, okay, well, I guess we got to let you in.
[03:11:23.663 --> 03:11:26.986]  And then of course they end up arresting me later that day with a piece of tape over my mouth.
[03:11:27.506 --> 03:11:41.338]  So, somebody is making calls to the Capitol Police, it's obviously a Democrat, and they have a list with names and faces of individuals that they want banned and arrested just for being at the Capitol!
[03:11:41.559 --> 03:11:43.921]  So I guess, Ivan, we both have the honor of being on that list!
[03:11:45.109 --> 03:11:56.181]  So I won't pick up where you left off, but luckily, because we have the majority and I've already kind of paved the way with... I mostly spend my time in the House, because the House Sergeant at Arms works for the Speaker.
[03:11:56.601 --> 03:12:05.611]  If I'm on the Senate side, they're trying to find something to arrest me for, and that's why I'm very... I barely do any First Amendment activity in the Senate other than just sit and listen.
[03:12:06.051 --> 03:12:12.755]  Because the Senate Sergeant at Arms works for Chuck Schumer, and if Chuck Schumer wants to go ahead and arrest me, then he just looks over the Senate Sergeant at Arms.
[03:12:13.115 --> 03:12:23.822]  When you know the construct of this law enforcement entity known as the Capitol Police Board and the Capitol Police, it starts to unravel and you start to understand why you are criminalized, why I am currently not.
[03:12:24.222 --> 03:12:33.668]  Why those that were out there on January 6th were criminalized, if you know all the different individual players, and I've laid that out and to be honest, as it relates to January 6th, we're going to hear some big news tomorrow.
[03:12:34.148 --> 03:12:45.174]  If it hits before the show, if you want me to come on and give some insight on that, I can say that I had a little bit of a role in what's about to be announced tomorrow related to January 6th and the U.S.
[03:12:45.214 --> 03:12:46.415]  Capitol and Capitol Police.
[03:12:48.410 --> 03:12:50.511]  Well, I guess we'll be waiting and seeing.
[03:12:50.591 --> 03:12:56.374]  I'll be hosting the War Room tomorrow, so I'll be paying attention to that.
[03:12:56.494 --> 03:12:59.636]  And I guess now we have a third member here.
[03:12:59.696 --> 03:13:01.397]  You're probably going to be on the list next, too.
[03:13:01.417 --> 03:13:02.938]  They'll probably try to ban you from the Capitol.
[03:13:04.199 --> 03:13:06.740]  We've been getting pushed around all week.
[03:13:06.860 --> 03:13:10.102]  It's like wherever they tell you they need credentials.
[03:13:10.522 --> 03:13:14.184]  He was at the Hunter Biden testimony yesterday.
[03:13:15.665 --> 03:13:17.246]  You asked him about the cocaine, right?
[03:13:18.519 --> 03:13:26.887]  You know, what I asked him was if he did release the laptop intentionally because he resents his father and hates his stepmother.
[03:13:26.987 --> 03:13:29.810]  Because I think there's a little bit of a Hamlet situation going on.
[03:13:29.850 --> 03:13:31.431]  I'm going full Shakespeare with this.
[03:13:31.972 --> 03:13:39.245]   With Hunter Biden, I just wonder if, you know, I get he's a He's a drunk, he's a drug addict, but doing that sort of
[03:13:39.245 --> 03:13:43.865]   thing repeatedly, it almost feels, it seems like at least his subconscious is at work, if not
[03:13:43.865 --> 03:13:45.065]  consciously doing it.
[03:13:45.065 --> 03:13:50.084]   Well, and I mean, my, my, my retort to that, because I think that there's a, there's a
[03:13:50.084 --> 03:13:51.084]  potential there.
[03:13:51.084 --> 03:13:56.084]   I mean, there's a percentage chance of that, but when he went into the hearing yesterday,
[03:13:56.084 --> 03:13:59.005]  obviously he was defensive of his father.
[03:13:58.998 --> 03:14:03.580]  He didn't say anything that would be incriminating of himself or his father or his family.
[03:14:03.940 --> 03:14:12.683]  And I feel like if that was the case, he would be a lot more willing to throw his father or the rest of his family under the bus, and he hasn't really been able to do that.
[03:14:13.003 --> 03:14:20.025]  Then again, it could have been a moment of a drug-induced or drunken stupor where he's just really feeling that resentment and decided to do it.
[03:14:20.605 --> 03:14:23.786]  So I guess that could be a potential scenario there, too.
[03:14:25.673 --> 03:14:26.153]  I believe so.
[03:14:26.173 --> 03:14:30.434]  I mean, I think there's something going on there because this sort of thing doesn't repeat itself.
[03:14:30.754 --> 03:14:37.956]  And I just imagine, I mean, I could see him actually having a lot of resentment, at least towards his father, because of the way he was raised, the way he was used.
[03:14:38.036 --> 03:14:41.596]  I mean, it was almost like, not like a son, but a tool for business.
[03:14:41.797 --> 03:14:43.737]  And I don't know if that's the way he raised kids.
[03:14:44.737 --> 03:14:49.778]  And obviously, it affected Hunter in some way, shape or form.
[03:14:49.818 --> 03:14:53.099]  He ended up doing so many drugs that he methed his teeth out of his head.
[03:14:54.366 --> 03:14:55.568]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:14:55.608 --> 03:15:00.935]  And you know, you talk about Ashley Biden, I mean, a lot of students of the father visited upon the children.
[03:15:01.670 --> 03:15:05.632]  Yeah, Joe Biden is really a disgusting creep at the end of the day.
[03:15:05.712 --> 03:15:09.273]  Aside from the political corruption he's engaged in, he truly is a disgusting creep.
[03:15:10.014 --> 03:15:14.996]  And the results that you see from the family are proof positive of that.
[03:15:16.477 --> 03:15:22.900]  By the way, you were, so did, I mean, some people are saying Hunter Biden looked like he was even high on drugs yesterday after the hearing.
[03:15:23.180 --> 03:15:28.182]  I guess he's not getting drug tested despite all these charges he's facing?
[03:15:30.968 --> 03:15:31.949]  That, I mean, I have no idea.
[03:15:31.989 --> 03:15:32.769]  I mean, I looked at him.
[03:15:33.430 --> 03:15:34.771]  We almost made eye contact.
[03:15:34.811 --> 03:15:39.274]  When I said that statement, I could tell that hit a nerve because he was struggling not to look at me.
[03:15:39.614 --> 03:15:41.455]  I can't say that he looked like he was on drugs.
[03:15:41.515 --> 03:15:43.937]  I mean, I've been around a lot of people that were on drugs.
[03:15:43.957 --> 03:15:48.120]  I used to direct music videos and, to be honest, I gotta be honest about everything I'm seeing.
[03:15:48.180 --> 03:15:50.861]  I mean, he didn't look like he was on drugs when he was walking in.
[03:15:50.881 --> 03:15:52.603]  He looked vulnerable.
[03:15:52.803 --> 03:15:55.424]  He definitely looked vulnerable, though, I can tell you that.
[03:15:57.566 --> 03:16:00.047]  Well, Ivan, what do you think comes next?
[03:16:01.124 --> 03:16:04.465]  I think the Republicans have the case open and shut against Biden.
[03:16:05.125 --> 03:16:12.267]  I think when they eventually do the public hearing of Hunter Biden, this is when it's all going to become undeniable to the public.
[03:16:12.307 --> 03:16:16.349]  I mean, liberals and Democrats, you know, they don't they deny basic science and biology, so they'll deny it.
[03:16:16.369 --> 03:16:18.749]  But I mean, the average American is going to see just the corruption.
[03:16:18.769 --> 03:16:20.050]  They're going to see the payments and everything.
[03:16:21.590 --> 03:16:23.431]  So, I mean, how do you think this goes?
[03:16:25.367 --> 03:16:27.068]  Do you think the Republicans have any strategy?
[03:16:27.088 --> 03:16:31.571]  Because I'd hate to see them take Biden out, which is exactly what the Democrats need at this point.
[03:16:33.292 --> 03:16:43.038]  I think the first step is going to be, I mean, after what's the hearing that happened today with Austin, the first step is going to be, I think Corey Mills is going to start to push harder for an impeachment of Lloyd Austin.
[03:16:43.078 --> 03:16:45.019]  He's already drafted those articles of impeachment.
[03:16:46.387 --> 03:17:07.276]  And I talked to one of the folks that I talked to that's in a senior position said that they're looking at doing a sort of COVID style hearing of the Personnel and Readiness Subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee to continue to expose the illegal COVID mandate to educate the public because they need to respond to what Tucker's exposing through X and you guys have been exposing on X now.
[03:17:08.036 --> 03:17:24.232]   And after that, I mean, if they do succeed in that impeachment and now I think looks like there's going to be a Senate impeachment trial of Mayorkas I think that might be enough of an impetus coupled with the Hunter Biden hearing for a move for a impeachment of Biden.
[03:17:24.592 --> 03:17:36.638]  Now, I don't agree with any of that because I don't consider any of them to be legitimately, you know, Biden's not duly and legitimately elected, so none of those downstream appointees are legitimate in my book, but the institutions are.
[03:17:36.658 --> 03:17:45.923]  I mean, most of these guys think that there was a legitimate election, so they treat them as a legitimate Secretary of Homeland Security or a legitimate Secretary of Defense, so I get that.
[03:17:46.503 --> 03:18:04.493]  I guess they're trying to do what they can with what they have with a slim majority because you have so many dumb China-first Republicans in the House that don't want to vote to impeach Biden because let's face it, they're getting just as much money, probably 10% for the big guy, for their own pockets like the Don Bacons of the world.
[03:18:04.872 --> 03:18:12.091]   or the David Valadao's or Dan Newhouse's or Ken Buck or this guy, scumbag that didn't vote to impeach
[03:18:12.091 --> 03:18:17.051]  Mallorca's Gallagher, for example, or McClintock.
[03:18:17.051 --> 03:18:24.772]   So we have such a slim majority that they need to convince those guys to vote to impeach Biden for this to go anywhere.
[03:18:24.772 --> 03:18:29.772]   Well, and I think that the corruption of these people is gonna become not just the Biden's,
[03:18:29.772 --> 03:18:35.891]   I mean, the American left, the Democrat party, the mayors, the district attorneys the prosecuting attorneys the judges
[03:18:36.840 --> 03:18:42.863]  I think it's going to become so obvious that there's going to be some sort of line and threshold that gets crossed.
[03:18:43.043 --> 03:18:44.524]  And we're not violent people.
[03:18:44.564 --> 03:18:45.725]  I'm not saying there's going to be violence.
[03:18:45.765 --> 03:18:46.705]  I'm not predicting violence.
[03:18:46.745 --> 03:18:48.506]  In fact, I'm against all violence.
[03:18:49.327 --> 03:18:56.220]   But I think what you're going to start seeing is I'll use this as an example of what we just saw.
[03:18:56.260 --> 03:18:58.162]  You know, Lloyd Austin will be walking through the Capitol.
[03:18:58.182 --> 03:19:03.044]  It won't just be our guest there giving him the what-for.
[03:19:03.145 --> 03:19:05.846]  There'll be 30 people out there giving him the what-for.
[03:19:06.386 --> 03:19:13.571]  And his security detail might be a little less inclined to stop those people from getting into his face, peacefully, politically, with his First Amendment.
[03:19:13.651 --> 03:19:17.613]  Same thing with these mayors that are letting illegal immigrants murder their citizens.
[03:19:17.793 --> 03:19:27.001]   I think that police are going to be a lot less Inclined to try to stand down peaceful First Amendment activity when these people are in public.
[03:19:28.662 --> 03:19:28.862]  Right.
[03:19:28.882 --> 03:19:30.003]  Another way to assess it.
[03:19:30.023 --> 03:19:31.304]  Again, this is as an analyst.
[03:19:31.324 --> 03:19:32.445]  I'm going to say it this way.
[03:19:33.126 --> 03:19:39.371]  I see a moment where we move from peaceful and patriotic to simply patriotic and it'll be very peaceful for us.
[03:19:41.383 --> 03:19:49.170]  Yeah, and we've always been that way and that's why they have to set us up with false flags like January 6th to try to depict us as violent people when we're obviously not.
[03:19:49.471 --> 03:19:52.774]  And we have the track record of peace and they have the track record of violence.
[03:19:53.294 --> 03:19:54.355]  I want to ask you a quick question.
[03:19:54.375 --> 03:19:55.516]  We have self-restraint.
[03:19:55.997 --> 03:19:57.258]  We control our emotions.
[03:19:57.478 --> 03:19:59.300]  They're the ones that can't control themselves.
[03:19:59.810 --> 03:20:01.031]  I want to ask you a quick question.
[03:20:01.051 --> 03:20:03.151]  This is a completely different subject here.
[03:20:03.471 --> 03:20:05.132]  But I want to get your opinion on something.
[03:20:05.452 --> 03:20:06.633]  This story hit the news today.
[03:20:07.073 --> 03:20:10.034]  German battleship in the Red Sea misidentifies U.S.
[03:20:10.074 --> 03:20:12.875]  drone, fires two missiles, both fail to reach the target.
[03:20:12.915 --> 03:20:18.357]  So we had a drone misidentified that ended up causing the strike in Jordan.
[03:20:18.698 --> 03:20:20.578]  Now you have a drone misidentified here.
[03:20:20.758 --> 03:20:22.979]  How are drones being misidentified?
[03:20:23.079 --> 03:20:24.680]  Something seems off about this to me, Ivan.
[03:20:27.409 --> 03:20:33.572]  Well, we do have a capability there in Jordan that covers down on two other countries, as far as I understand.
[03:20:33.833 --> 03:20:44.458]  So, I mean, misidentifying a drone, I don't know if that's something too outlandish, because there's a lot of commercially off-the-shelf available drones that you can purchase.
[03:20:45.059 --> 03:20:48.481]  Without knowing more details of it, I can't really give an accurate assessment.
[03:20:48.561 --> 03:20:50.402]  I just want to be honest in what I say, so.
[03:20:51.226 --> 03:20:59.309]  Alright, I'm sure you can find some corrupt dirtbag there in the Capitol to go give the what-for and the how-to, so I'm going to let you go here.
[03:20:59.349 --> 03:21:03.651]  Folks, that does it for the InfoWars Alex Jones Show brought to you by InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:21:03.671 --> 03:21:07.613]  Thanks to Ivan Reikland, thanks to Ezra Levant, and all of our other guests.
[03:21:07.633 --> 03:21:08.913]  Thanks to everybody for tuning in today.
[03:21:08.953 --> 03:21:10.194]  Great job by the crew.
[03:21:10.554 --> 03:21:12.195]  I'm off the InfoWars War Room today.
[03:21:12.235 --> 03:21:22.009]   We're going to have guest hosts Drew Hernandez, Rob Dew, And then Alex Rosen, so tune into that and please continue to support us at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:21:22.030 --> 03:21:23.030]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[03:21:23.030 --> 03:21:28.989]   All I do is research, research trends, and I see what is having the best effects, what
[03:21:28.989 --> 03:21:30.850]  is having the best reviews.
[03:21:30.850 --> 03:21:37.150]   So a couple years ago, I saw different formulas out there that are known to create compounds
[03:21:37.150 --> 03:21:42.909]   in the blood that flush out the body and that create what they call vasodilation, opening
[03:21:42.909 --> 03:21:47.030]   up the arteries, opening up the veins, which is so important, not just for young people,
[03:21:47.030 --> 03:21:48.810]  but especially older people.
[03:21:48.810 --> 03:21:52.770]   And so then I had Dr. Judy Michovitz, who's such a renowned scientist and a whistleblower,
[03:21:52.796 --> 03:21:53.957]  She said, I love your formula.
[03:21:53.977 --> 03:21:54.837]  It's one of the best out there.
[03:21:55.397 --> 03:21:58.298]  And so this product, Nitric Boost, became a bestseller.
[03:21:58.778 --> 03:22:02.359]  Well, we decided to soup it up and make it even stronger.
[03:22:03.039 --> 03:22:05.220]  So it's the original formula, just a little bit stronger.
[03:22:05.780 --> 03:22:09.681]  Now Nitric Boost is available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:22:10.081 --> 03:22:14.000]   Because the problem was the supplier we had couldn't supply enough.
[03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:15.441]  We were selling out very, very quickly.
[03:22:15.441 --> 03:22:21.960]   But now we've got a big supply of Nitric Boost in stock, ready to ship at mfoolwarestore.com.
[03:22:21.960 --> 03:22:28.841]   And when I talk about vasodilation and the nitric oxide is a potent vasco-dilator,
[03:22:28.841 --> 03:22:33.299]   meaning it can help relax and widen blood vessels, this can lead to increased blood flow
[03:22:33.299 --> 03:22:36.799]   and improve circulation, which is critical to various body functions.
[03:22:36.799 --> 03:22:39.361]  So ladies and gentlemen, it funds the mFoolwar.
[03:22:39.361 --> 03:22:40.960]  It's an amazing product.
[03:22:41.018 --> 03:22:51.180]  So we have the new and improved, super powerful Nitric Boost back in stock, ready to ship for 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:22:51.480 --> 03:22:52.500]  This is a true win-win.
[03:22:52.900 --> 03:22:57.901]  This has the very same effect as some of the male enhancement things out there, but totally naturally.
[03:22:58.361 --> 03:23:02.882]  This does it in a natural way, and not that I need those products, but I've tried them.
[03:23:02.902 --> 03:23:03.742]  I've been to the doctor.
[03:23:04.022 --> 03:23:08.183]  They give you a prescription of it, and I've tried the top brands, the two top brands.
[03:23:09.063 --> 03:23:10.905]  And I'm not even trying to say that's what this is.
[03:23:11.225 --> 03:23:12.065]  That's off-label.
[03:23:12.105 --> 03:23:13.306]  That's not what this is even for.
[03:23:13.586 --> 03:23:14.407]  This is a supplement.
[03:23:14.807 --> 03:23:18.390]  But it is incredible what it does for your body.
[03:23:18.710 --> 03:23:23.053]  So get this amazing product now in stock, ready to ship.
[03:23:23.393 --> 03:23:27.796]  Nitric Boost today at InfoWarsStore.com for 40% off.
[03:23:28.076 --> 03:23:29.317]  You fund the InfoWar.
[03:23:29.597 --> 03:23:30.698]  It's so good for your body.
[03:23:31.138 --> 03:23:31.899]  Get it while you can.
[03:23:32.439 --> 03:23:34.280]  Well, nitric oxide is a key.
[03:23:34.340 --> 03:23:36.401]  It's made by our own bodies again.
[03:23:36.801 --> 03:23:41.003]  It's made by L-citrulline and L-arginine, the amino acids.
[03:23:41.343 --> 03:23:42.263]  So we're fed.
[03:23:42.643 --> 03:23:44.624]  You can get it from beet powder and other things.
[03:23:44.744 --> 03:23:46.985]  The nitric oxide relaxes.
[03:23:47.365 --> 03:23:50.528]  The endothelium, the vasculature, it relaxes the vein.
[03:23:50.848 --> 03:23:52.630]  It's a natural blood pressure.
[03:23:52.670 --> 03:23:54.151]  In fact, I use the two.
[03:23:54.271 --> 03:23:56.793]  Your InfoWars, I keep that on my shelf.
[03:23:57.153 --> 03:24:01.337]  And I feed myself the Cardio Miracle, which is just for straight food.
[03:24:01.697 --> 03:24:03.579]  It's a different formulation than that one.
[03:24:03.599 --> 03:24:06.041]  And the two together are a one-two punch.
[03:24:06.061 --> 03:24:10.484]  So you get in your food the ability to make what you need and no more.
[03:24:10.645 --> 03:24:11.685]  You've looked at our formula.
[03:24:11.745 --> 03:24:12.106]  You like it?
[03:24:13.291 --> 03:24:14.112]  I did and I do.
[03:24:14.432 --> 03:24:14.673]  Yes.
[03:24:15.734 --> 03:24:16.715]  I'm not a scientist like you.
[03:24:16.755 --> 03:24:19.257]  What do these compounds do creating nitrous oxide?
[03:24:19.297 --> 03:24:19.838]  What does it do?
[03:24:20.338 --> 03:24:22.000]  It relaxes the vasculature.
[03:24:22.260 --> 03:24:24.983]  So the clot will go through and not restrict.
[03:24:25.303 --> 03:24:26.905]  It allows it to relax.
[03:24:26.965 --> 03:24:34.364]   It lowers the blood pressure, has the toxic synthetic lipid nanoparticles similar to the
[03:24:34.364 --> 03:24:36.404]  one in the COVID shot.
[03:24:36.404 --> 03:24:41.444]   We saw athletes dropping dead on the field, passing out, falling down, all the things
[03:24:41.444 --> 03:24:42.444]  that we see.
[03:24:42.444 --> 03:24:43.804]  Why is it particularly the athletes?
[03:24:43.804 --> 03:24:47.405]  They're operating at such a high level in their mitochondria.
[03:24:47.405 --> 03:24:53.844]   This is an energy production, oxygen necessary disease because athletes are running, they're
[03:24:53.844 --> 03:24:59.084]   constricted, they're working so that the blood flows and it doesn't flow, which is why your
[03:24:59.084 --> 03:25:04.165]   nitric oxide product, that new product, I hope you'll show it because that's a very
[03:25:04.165 --> 03:25:07.524]  important thing to have for acute events.
[03:25:07.552 --> 03:25:13.996]  It does all under the tongue, give you an instant relaxing of your endothelium, your vasculature.
[03:25:14.056 --> 03:25:19.199]  So get Nitric Boost today at InfoWarsStore.com for 40% off.
[03:25:19.579 --> 03:25:20.300]  Get it while you can.
