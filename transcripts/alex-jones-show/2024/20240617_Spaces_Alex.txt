[00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:43.691]  And we are live.
[00:06:44.342 --> 00:06:46.624]  Guys, appreciate you guys joining in.
[00:06:47.104 --> 00:06:48.625]  Appreciate you guys listening.
[00:06:49.005 --> 00:06:53.248]  We've got none other than Alex Jones on the space.
[00:06:53.708 --> 00:06:59.012]  We're going to be speaking about all of the things that have been happening to him in the last few weeks.
[00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:03.792]  Including the possible closure of Infowars.
[00:07:04.332 --> 00:07:06.212]  And you know how our space is.
[00:07:06.272 --> 00:07:07.453]  We're going to speak to Alex.
[00:07:07.493 --> 00:07:08.473]  He's going to answer.
[00:07:08.513 --> 00:07:09.513]  He's going to explain things.
[00:07:09.553 --> 00:07:10.853]  He's going to tell us what's happening.
[00:07:11.374 --> 00:07:14.334]  But more than that, you may have some questions yourself.
[00:07:14.374 --> 00:07:15.615]  You may disagree with him.
[00:07:16.015 --> 00:07:18.875]  And so we are going to be going down that road for sure.
[00:07:19.035 --> 00:07:21.995]  Alex, thank you so much for taking your time out to join us.
[00:07:21.995 --> 00:07:28.554]  Alex, did you need to unmute your mic?
[00:07:28.554 --> 00:07:30.554]  Right, button up inside.
[00:07:30.147 --> 00:07:31.188]  Sorry, I apologize.
[00:07:31.268 --> 00:07:32.448]  Thank you for having me.
[00:07:32.548 --> 00:07:33.729]  I gave you an amazing intro.
[00:07:33.989 --> 00:07:34.349]  You did.
[00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:35.129]  Thank you for having me.
[00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:36.330]  I apologize for messing it up.
[00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.411]  All good, all good.
[00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:39.011]  Sorry, Alex.
[00:07:39.551 --> 00:07:42.032]  So, I mean, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:07:43.013 --> 00:07:46.374]  I mean, look, we've been hearing about what's happening to InfoWars.
[00:07:46.474 --> 00:07:48.235]  I know you did a couple of spaces yourself.
[00:07:48.255 --> 00:07:49.535]  You did a number of shows yourself.
[00:07:50.116 --> 00:08:00.257]   But just let people know, from your perspective, First of all, an overview of what's happening and then we'll ask specific questions about who do you think's behind this.
[00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:01.138]  Anyway, go ahead, Alex.
[00:08:01.859 --> 00:08:03.300]  Well, that's a huge subject.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.601]  I mean, I want to be honest with you.
[00:08:05.281 --> 00:08:12.647]  Last night after my daughter went to bed, my youngest daughter, me and my wife sat around the kitchen table and I said, I cannot believe what just happened.
[00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:15.830]  And I can't imagine what President Trump is going through.
[00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:28.656]   So there's so many little pieces to this, but bottom line, Judge Chris Lopez is a very respected federal judge in Houston, and that's where our bankruptcy was assigned two years ago.
[00:08:29.757 --> 00:08:31.577]  And so it's not the judge's fault.
[00:08:31.597 --> 00:08:44.483]  The way the court system works is there's trustees and chief restructuring officers that are in the pool that basically rotate through, they get picked for the case.
[00:08:45.103 --> 00:08:48.502]   And if you don't object to them, They get assigned.
[00:08:48.662 --> 00:08:54.805]  Well, the plaintiffs that we now know are total, you know, the controllers, the plaintiffs, the law firms are deep state.
[00:08:55.725 --> 00:08:56.565]  Let's come out in court.
[00:08:57.246 --> 00:08:59.266]  They approved of these U.S.
[00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:07.970]  trustee that works for the Justice Department and for the chief restructuring officer, who I later learned were like flaming leftist, you know, anti-Trump, anti-Alex Jones.
[00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:14.032]  So they come in the last two years and they try to, the CRO tries to set me up.
[00:09:14.924 --> 00:09:16.084]  Secret court filings.
[00:09:16.144 --> 00:09:17.105]  I'm stealing money.
[00:09:18.165 --> 00:09:27.208]  The judge sends in high-level third-party investigators and accounting firms at my expense.
[00:09:27.768 --> 00:09:29.969]  We're talking a million plus bucks, three groups.
[00:09:30.549 --> 00:09:35.130]  They tear everything apart, do forensic accounting, and come back and say, no, there's no money hidden.
[00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:36.551]  Jones didn't do this.
[00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:41.933]  So then I go through all this because the media is like, oh, Jones is hiding money.
[00:09:41.953 --> 00:09:42.613]  He's a criminal.
[00:09:42.653 --> 00:09:43.333]  He's Al Capone.
[00:09:44.045 --> 00:09:59.209]  And I only filed for bankruptcy because I was out of money with a whole billion and a half dollar judgment that was rigged, where both judges in Texas and Connecticut found me guilty for supposedly not giving over, you know, evidence and discovery, but I gave them everything, so they found nothing.
[00:09:59.629 --> 00:10:00.849]  So instead they default me.
[00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:05.730]  HBO runs a huge production in both trials with makeup and scripts.
[00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:06.571]  It's a movie set.
[00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:07.931]  I mean, this is next level.
[00:10:09.119 --> 00:10:09.919]  Weaponization.
[00:10:10.539 --> 00:10:12.080]  And the CIA, we now know, was involved.
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.860]  They were beta testing this whole thing of weaponization.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:28.303]  So, two Fridays ago, now about 16 days ago, 17 days ago, it's 5 o'clock, I'm about to leave the office, I've done my show, most of the crew's leaving, and I notice there's more security guards there.
[00:10:28.323 --> 00:10:29.823]  I have a private security company I've used for years.
[00:10:30.564 --> 00:10:31.304]  I said, what's going on?
[00:10:31.324 --> 00:10:32.024]  They're like, we don't know.
[00:10:32.895 --> 00:10:34.676]  We're told something's coming up tonight at 9 o'clock.
[00:10:34.736 --> 00:10:35.697]  So I call my lawyers.
[00:10:35.717 --> 00:10:36.857]  They go, hey, we just got word.
[00:10:37.337 --> 00:10:39.058]  They're locking the doors at 9 o'clock tonight.
[00:10:39.819 --> 00:10:40.759]  We don't know how they're going to do it.
[00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:41.620]  There's no court order.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.181]  Judge Lopez is not called for this.
[00:10:44.901 --> 00:10:46.562]  The CRO does not have this power.
[00:10:47.623 --> 00:10:48.483]  We don't understand this.
[00:10:48.984 --> 00:10:50.645]  The CRO is just an advisor to the court.
[00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:56.107]  And so I literally explained to them, showed them the law, stopped them closing it.
[00:10:56.588 --> 00:11:01.650]  He then, with the next security crew, same company the next day, tries to shut it down again.
[00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.471]  His name's Pat McGill.
[00:11:03.283 --> 00:11:08.266]  So I have to sleep up there for three days, and then the media's like, oh, it's not happening.
[00:11:09.346 --> 00:11:24.595]  But then on Monday, the plaintiff's lawyers, Democratic Party, same group suing Trump, same group suing Giuliani, top law firm out of New York and Houston, they go in and file that Monday, now two weeks ago today, to shut me down.
[00:11:25.802 --> 00:11:31.604]  And their reason was, he's crazy, he claims he's being shut down, total gaslighting, so we're gonna shut him down right now.
[00:11:32.084 --> 00:11:34.344]  The judge said, no, we're gonna have a 14th meeting to decide.
[00:11:35.225 --> 00:11:47.808]  They then filed a 14th hearing to take my real Alex Jones and ex, that's AP Reuters, they filed to take the company over and close the doors last Friday, three days ago.
[00:11:48.548 --> 00:11:51.629]  So everybody's got that, okay, see, Alex Jones wasn't crying wolf.
[00:11:52.267 --> 00:11:53.928]  They wanted me kicked out, fired.
[00:11:54.308 --> 00:11:57.870]  And the judge said under federal law, it's an LLC, I'm the owner.
[00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.431]  He said, I can't even override that.
[00:12:01.011 --> 00:12:02.752]  If it goes into receivership, I can do it.
[00:12:02.792 --> 00:12:05.413]  But he goes, he told the CRO, who do you think you are?
[00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:06.754]  10 times.
[00:12:07.294 --> 00:12:10.856]  He said, under law, you do not control this company.
[00:12:11.276 --> 00:12:12.817]  And Mr. Jones acts in good faith.
[00:12:13.177 --> 00:12:14.818]  You've had two years to investigate him.
[00:12:15.278 --> 00:12:16.398]  You never filed a lawsuit.
[00:12:16.418 --> 00:12:17.199]  You never made a claim.
[00:12:17.219 --> 00:12:20.959]   because he's beginning the secret filings this guy files saying I'm a
[00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:24.459]   crook the judge has been giving my lawyers that even though this guy
[00:12:24.459 --> 00:12:27.459]   thought it would keep it secret so it's clear the Justice Department other
[00:12:27.459 --> 00:12:32.939]   groups are manipulating this and the US trustee the Justice Department works
[00:12:32.939 --> 00:12:37.098]   with him and and basically she also called for us to be closed Friday so
[00:12:37.098 --> 00:12:42.179]   they 100% did this and Judge Chris Lopez very respected top of the class you know
[00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:46.699]  top school, he said, "We're not doing that."
[00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:47.994]  I'm not shutting down InfoWars.
[00:12:48.754 --> 00:12:50.755]  I'm giving Mr. Jones back his company.
[00:12:51.336 --> 00:12:51.916]  And the U.S.
[00:12:51.956 --> 00:12:56.779]  trustee got up and the other lawyers and said, we pray your honor, which is the old way to say it.
[00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:58.821]  The old courts are a temple.
[00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:00.021]  They said, we pray to you.
[00:13:00.582 --> 00:13:01.863]  We pray to you, your honor.
[00:13:01.883 --> 00:13:03.624]  So they're really worshiping him.
[00:13:04.444 --> 00:13:07.546]  And they say, we pray to you to not give it back to him.
[00:13:07.606 --> 00:13:08.247]  He's a crook.
[00:13:08.307 --> 00:13:08.807]  He's evil.
[00:13:08.847 --> 00:13:09.347]  He's bad.
[00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:10.928]  And the judge says, sit down.
[00:13:10.968 --> 00:13:11.809]  I've heard enough from you.
[00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:13.270]  So this is all I was in the courtroom.
[00:13:14.033 --> 00:13:18.134]  And the federal courts aren't like state courts where there's cameras, but there's a transcript, it's public.
[00:13:18.594 --> 00:13:20.475]  He goes, I've heard enough from you, sit down right now.
[00:13:21.115 --> 00:13:24.055]  And he says, Pat McGill, I've got one more order to you, the CRO.
[00:13:24.796 --> 00:13:27.756]  He goes, you're to hand Mr. Jones' bank accounts back today.
[00:13:28.877 --> 00:13:30.737]  It's his company, you are removed.
[00:13:31.697 --> 00:13:38.919]  And so that was the real victory that I'd already liquidated all my assets the last two years, already sold extra stuff.
[00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:43.367]  So when they hear, oh, Jones had to liquidate, that's in my personal, that was already done.
[00:13:43.387 --> 00:13:44.468]  So the media spun that.
[00:13:44.928 --> 00:13:47.269]  I didn't care about a lake house and a little farm I had.
[00:13:47.289 --> 00:13:47.930]  I never even went there.
[00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:48.770]  I was too busy.
[00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.511]  So that, that was my move too.
[00:13:51.531 --> 00:13:53.733]  It's just, you get it all on the line, we're done.
[00:13:54.073 --> 00:13:55.213]  I'll give these plaintiffs the money.
[00:13:55.614 --> 00:13:57.355]  The plaintiffs got up and said, we don't want money.
[00:13:57.375 --> 00:13:58.795]  We want to shut him down again.
[00:13:58.815 --> 00:14:00.656]  And the judge says, that's outrageous.
[00:14:00.716 --> 00:14:02.817]  It's not in the federal government, not in the U.S.
[00:14:02.838 --> 00:14:05.279]  Constitution, not in Congress's laws to do that.
[00:14:05.699 --> 00:14:07.240]  So he excoriated them.
[00:14:07.944 --> 00:14:10.786]  No less than 10 times, because that's a real judge.
[00:14:11.626 --> 00:14:14.868]  That's why the media was attacking him and had him in my company back.
[00:14:15.569 --> 00:14:19.731]  Now they're going to attack me in the state courts and try to take control of the company.
[00:14:20.271 --> 00:14:26.095]  But he kept control through a new trustee he put in over my personal, because I'm the real owner of the company.
[00:14:26.635 --> 00:14:40.293]   And it just so happens, this amazing, respected special person, the term would be receiver, Uh, would be trustee was just showed up there.
[00:14:40.333 --> 00:14:40.834]  Never met him.
[00:14:41.254 --> 00:14:44.816]  Everybody's like, well, this guy's really respected and he'll actually follow law.
[00:14:45.177 --> 00:14:49.859]  And so now I don't have these low level people that got pushed up by the Justice Department put in.
[00:14:49.899 --> 00:14:52.781]  I've got a respected guy that's fair with the judge.
[00:14:52.821 --> 00:14:57.344]  He's retained control and I hate to sit there and kiss the judge's ass, but he's just following the law.
[00:14:57.844 --> 00:15:07.528]   And so this is a major devastating move against them because America, the judge even said during this, 30 minute closing statement, which he never does.
[00:15:08.508 --> 00:15:09.928]  It was like something out of Kill a Mockingbird.
[00:15:09.948 --> 00:15:10.549]  It was powerful.
[00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:14.850]  He said, hopefully this type of behavior changes with the election.
[00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.190]  He was appointed by Trump.
[00:15:16.991 --> 00:15:30.415]  He said, hopefully this type of behavior ends with the election because he's, they were crazy enough, guys, to introduce transcripts of my show two weeks ago, where I talked about the CRO calling me when he filed a secret report against me, saying I was stealing money.
[00:15:30.955 --> 00:15:32.736]  He calls me and denies he did it.
[00:15:32.776 --> 00:15:33.616]  So I record him.
[00:15:34.477 --> 00:15:35.258]  Saying he never did it.
[00:15:35.278 --> 00:15:36.399]  Well, the judge had that filing.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.822]  And I recorded him doing all this stuff.
[00:15:38.882 --> 00:15:39.703]  I filed it in the court.
[00:15:40.423 --> 00:15:41.685]  The judge had never listened to it.
[00:15:42.085 --> 00:15:45.268]  They were dumb enough to demand over lunch he read the transcripts.
[00:15:46.049 --> 00:15:51.055]  So he read the transcripts and he came back and asked, is it true you tried to close his business two weeks ago?
[00:15:52.336 --> 00:15:53.457]  They said, yes, your honor.
[00:15:53.777 --> 00:15:55.199]  There were guns in the building.
[00:15:55.939 --> 00:15:57.100]  Well, we have concealed carry.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.201]  We have private security.
[00:15:58.741 --> 00:15:59.842]  And the judge goes, what do you mean?
[00:15:59.862 --> 00:16:01.083]  They go, well, there was a crosshair.
[00:16:01.103 --> 00:16:02.924]  The judge said, did somebody threaten you?
[00:16:03.085 --> 00:16:03.325]  No.
[00:16:03.785 --> 00:16:04.906]  The judge said, I've heard enough.
[00:16:04.946 --> 00:16:05.466]  You're done.
[00:16:06.027 --> 00:16:10.410]  So they were literally acting like we had guns pointed at them.
[00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.912]  They were literally saying I was going to steal money.
[00:16:12.952 --> 00:16:15.354]  They were running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:23.020]  And for the first time in six years of me being under lawfare, a judge finally literally stomped on their tail.
[00:16:26.551 --> 00:16:37.467]  I'm going to ask you a few more questions, but I just want to let the audience know because I was like, you know when I heard you talking about the fact that people want to shut you down, I was like, really?
[00:16:37.487 --> 00:16:40.993]  And I know you were one of the four people that ADL didn't want back, right?
[00:16:43.622 --> 00:16:48.584]  Obviously I did a bit of journalism, you know, and I went to quite a few of the student encampments.
[00:16:48.905 --> 00:16:54.248]  And there's various encampments, some have a lot of people from the right, some have a lot of people from the left, some have a mixed bag.
[00:16:54.668 --> 00:16:58.270]  And one of the encampments I went to was very much people from the left.
[00:16:59.455 --> 00:17:03.498]  And they were asking me some questions like, you know, who have you, you know, who have you co-hosted before?
[00:17:03.538 --> 00:17:06.180]  And I said, look, like people like Alex Jones and Andrew Teh.
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:12.644]  And as soon as I mentioned, I mentioned a few other names as well, but as soon as I mentioned yours and Tate's name, they were literally, took me out of the camp.
[00:17:12.664 --> 00:17:16.066]  They didn't even let the boys ask the questions, even though they're part of the same team.
[00:17:16.426 --> 00:17:24.272]  So I get the fact that, like, I see the level of emotions that come from people who don't like you, Alex, as well as Andrew Teh.
[00:17:24.732 --> 00:17:28.975]  So, I mean, coming back to it, so now we understand what has happened up to now.
[00:17:30.255 --> 00:17:35.138]  Let me ask you a question before I ask what's going to happen next, and then I will bring some other people in as well.
[00:17:35.478 --> 00:17:37.739]  Who do you think specifically behind this?
[00:17:38.739 --> 00:17:40.900]  Well, that's a great question, but let me just segue for a moment.
[00:17:40.961 --> 00:17:50.485]  Anybody can search my name, and the headlines are fake, but buried in Reuters, AP, Bloomberg, they admit, okay, there was a plan to shut it down.
[00:17:50.525 --> 00:17:51.586]  They thought there was a threat.
[00:17:52.066 --> 00:17:54.567]  Okay, they did try to shut it down at this hearing and the next hearing.
[00:17:55.034 --> 00:17:57.156]  Three hearings, they tried to shut me down the last two weeks.
[00:17:57.536 --> 00:18:15.370]  And I get, to me, I didn't believe that the private security firm, bonded, that I'd used for seven years, armed guards, big company, you know, here in Austin, my personal security and some of my friends, were ordered to close the doors 16 days ago, two Fridays ago, without a court order.
[00:18:16.431 --> 00:18:18.213]  I get, that didn't seem real to me.
[00:18:18.233 --> 00:18:20.114]  I mean, the judge said, what are you doing?
[00:18:20.174 --> 00:18:21.976]  You can't, you can't shut his company down.
[00:18:22.296 --> 00:18:23.537]  He told them that Friday.
[00:18:24.116 --> 00:18:24.976]  Just three days ago.
[00:18:25.016 --> 00:18:28.318]  So I know who did this, okay?
[00:18:29.458 --> 00:18:37.222]  And it hid in plain view, because I didn't understand all this until they had the fake judgments by the judges who found me guilty, which you're not supposed to do in America or anywhere, really.
[00:18:37.782 --> 00:18:41.524]  And then the jury set up, you know, how guilty I was, hearings on damages.
[00:18:43.525 --> 00:18:56.571]   They have the head FBI agent in Connecticut at the time, who was the chief counsel of the FBI, so the head of the FBI in Connecticut, He got up in the Connecticut show trial two years ago in November in Connecticut.
[00:18:56.611 --> 00:18:58.051]  It's on video and I can pull it up.
[00:18:58.932 --> 00:19:03.933]  And he said to their own lawyer, how'd you get involved?
[00:19:03.953 --> 00:19:04.333]  What'd you do?
[00:19:04.353 --> 00:19:13.595]  And he said, well, I heard about people questioning Sandy Hook and I got one phone call asking if I was really an FBI agent.
[00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:20.056]  So I went to Toscoff and Koskoff, this big democratic firm, and I organized the families and we sued Alex Jones.
[00:19:21.135 --> 00:19:24.778]  He won $95,000,000.
[00:19:25.098 --> 00:19:26.479]  Look it up.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.082]  FBI agent wins $95,000,000 against Alex Jones.
[00:19:30.482 --> 00:19:31.403]  Never said his name.
[00:19:31.843 --> 00:19:32.684]  Never knew who he was.
[00:19:32.724 --> 00:19:33.765]  None of my hosts said his name.
[00:19:34.125 --> 00:19:34.986]  Wasn't on my website.
[00:19:35.366 --> 00:19:36.587]  My lawyer said, did he ever say your name?
[00:19:36.807 --> 00:19:36.987]  No.
[00:19:37.428 --> 00:19:38.388]  His host ever say your name?
[00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:38.589]  No.
[00:19:38.649 --> 00:19:39.389]  Ever been on his website?
[00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:39.609]  No.
[00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.950]  Ever talked about him?
[00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.151]  No.
[00:19:41.891 --> 00:19:43.893]  So, this guy testifies.
[00:19:43.913 --> 00:19:48.456]  Just type in, FBI agent wins $95,000,000 against Alex Jones.
[00:19:48.476 --> 00:19:49.437]  You'll see his picture and everything.
[00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.403]  He organized it all.
[00:19:52.483 --> 00:20:01.006]  Then they get that undercover video, the Project Veritas spinoff, two months ago, three months ago, of them saying, former FBI, current CIA, we ran this.
[00:20:01.046 --> 00:20:01.786]  Well, I knew that.
[00:20:02.446 --> 00:20:06.147]  I mean, I have a family member that's in Asia this week on a trip, business trip.
[00:20:07.007 --> 00:20:09.648]  They were in Thailand and then in Japan.
[00:20:11.008 --> 00:20:13.229]  One morning they get up, front page of the paper's me.
[00:20:13.829 --> 00:20:16.870]  They go to Japan, front page of the paper's me the next day.
[00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:18.310]  This is just last week.
[00:20:20.013 --> 00:20:21.493]  It's like they're invading a country.
[00:20:21.593 --> 00:20:22.554]  I'm not that important.
[00:20:22.934 --> 00:20:34.662]  It's about destroying free speech, scaring everybody else off, and putting the fear of God into people of a billion and a half dollar judgment, if you question narratives, because they're planning new Jussie Smollett narratives, new things.
[00:20:35.082 --> 00:20:37.023]  Whether we're right or wrong, they don't want us questioning them.
[00:20:37.063 --> 00:20:39.725]  So then, here's the worst part.
[00:20:40.165 --> 00:20:43.207]  They said this in mediation two years ago, and again three months ago.
[00:20:43.867 --> 00:20:46.649]  And my lawyers told me, you can't talk about it, it's in mediation.
[00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:47.269]  So I didn't do it.
[00:20:47.309 --> 00:20:48.230]  Didn't violate the court rules.
[00:20:49.073 --> 00:20:56.474]  So the federal courthouse two months ago in Fort Worth, federal mediation in a courtroom, federal judge, like the most official type there is.
[00:20:57.134 --> 00:20:59.195]  This is a court mediation, this is not a regular mediation.
[00:20:59.735 --> 00:21:00.535]  This case is so big.
[00:21:02.515 --> 00:21:10.957]  They get up, and I can only talk about it now because they told my lawyers the next week in a non-mediation, the same stuff, they said, listen, we know Jones doesn't have all this money.
[00:21:11.717 --> 00:21:15.958]  If he just comes out against the Second Amendment and some other things, we will leave him alone.
[00:21:16.578 --> 00:21:17.778]  And my lawyer said, excuse me?
[00:21:18.516 --> 00:21:21.139]  So my lawyer calls me and says, Hey, you can talk about this now.
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:26.486]  They just admitted it on the telephone in a conference that it was about trying.
[00:21:26.927 --> 00:21:28.048]  They thought I was about the money.
[00:21:28.869 --> 00:21:32.734]  So they thought if they did this, they didn't want money at the courthouse steps.
[00:21:33.435 --> 00:21:35.918]  They literally thought I would finally become their creature.
[00:21:36.761 --> 00:21:39.023]  And now they're finding out there's no price tag on Alex Jones.
[00:21:39.083 --> 00:21:50.054]  So, this was 100% run by the State Department, the CIA, and the Justice Department as a beta test, just like the State Department, CIA is running the censorship, the control, the ADL is their lapdog.
[00:21:52.276 --> 00:21:54.538]  I'm the big target because they said, that's a big populace.
[00:21:55.854 --> 00:22:01.598]  He, just like the FBI agent, CIA agent said, he's the loudest voice, he was the lead elephant.
[00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:06.762]  It's not that I'm that important, it's just that I was the biggest up front six, seven years ago.
[00:22:07.242 --> 00:22:11.165]  Now it's Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, above that Elon Musk.
[00:22:11.605 --> 00:22:13.947]  So I'm kind of, you know, a backbencher now.
[00:22:14.007 --> 00:22:17.890]  I mean, I'm still reaching tens of millions a day, but nothing compared to Elon or, you know, Joe Rogan.
[00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:19.731]  But that's what happened.
[00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:24.555]  I was picked because I had 30 million viewers a day, every day, seven years ago.
[00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.332]  And so I did have the biggest show of political talk in the world then.
[00:22:28.732 --> 00:22:30.513]  I don't mean like 30 million had impressions.
[00:22:30.573 --> 00:22:36.637]  I mean, I had 30 million people on radio, TV, and dialing in, 10 million a day on my website.
[00:22:36.657 --> 00:22:37.678]  We could see their IP addresses.
[00:22:38.238 --> 00:22:40.520]  So they went, holy hell, this guy is popular.
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.121]  We better shut him down.
[00:22:42.161 --> 00:22:45.082]  But it didn't work because the emergency transmission already got out.
[00:22:45.102 --> 00:22:50.826]  But this was run by Obama's Stay Behind Network in the Defense Authorization Act of 2017.
[00:22:53.061 --> 00:22:58.505]  Which they, you know, funded the year before, before he left office, in the Countering Foreign Disinformation Propaganda Act.
[00:22:58.925 --> 00:23:00.646]  And I talked to a top U.S.
[00:23:00.686 --> 00:23:04.028]  Senator yesterday, in person, in Detroit, who pulled me aside.
[00:23:04.048 --> 00:23:05.349]  I won't say names.
[00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.150]  And said, tell me about this.
[00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:07.811]  And I explained it.
[00:23:07.831 --> 00:23:08.731]  He goes, yeah, we know that.
[00:23:09.172 --> 00:23:10.313]  We're getting ready to go after him.
[00:23:10.353 --> 00:23:11.413]  We understand the networks.
[00:23:12.214 --> 00:23:13.775]  And they just, they said, how did you know this?
[00:23:13.795 --> 00:23:14.956]  I said, well, I read the legislation.
[00:23:15.556 --> 00:23:18.398]  So the good news is, Trump is aware of this.
[00:23:19.011 --> 00:23:21.673]  Trump knows what's going on, and so they're in a lot of trouble now.
[00:23:22.014 --> 00:23:22.954]  That's why they're so scared.
[00:23:23.255 --> 00:23:28.339]  Not of retribution, not of prison, not of us trying to hurt them, but the fact that they committed this coup against America.
[00:23:31.822 --> 00:23:34.564]  So, one last question, then I will bring some more people in.
[00:23:35.946 --> 00:23:40.049]  You kind of explained it, and you've alluded to it, but where do you think this is going to go next?
[00:23:41.791 --> 00:23:44.953]  Well, they're totally desperate with 140 days left to the election.
[00:23:46.275 --> 00:23:46.415]  And...
[00:23:47.381 --> 00:23:48.242]  I'm not that important.
[00:23:48.462 --> 00:23:53.607]  They just chose me because I was popular and flamboyant and did some quirky stuff.
[00:23:54.207 --> 00:24:03.255]  They thought they could pull that out of context, you know, gay frog stuff, and then say this guy's a lunatic, and then once people accepted... There was a Wall Street Journal article six years ago.
[00:24:04.056 --> 00:24:10.302]  It was like a 30-page article, and it was a subscription article that said, we're going to shut down Julian Assange.
[00:24:11.062 --> 00:24:13.745]  When the left doesn't defend him, we'll have the left.
[00:24:14.454 --> 00:24:15.675]  And we're going to shut down Alex Jones.
[00:24:15.755 --> 00:24:17.355]  If they don't defend him, we'll have them all.
[00:24:17.876 --> 00:24:19.376]  And NATO was actually involved in the meeting.
[00:24:19.396 --> 00:24:20.257]  It was in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:24:21.097 --> 00:24:24.939]  And so that was their plan.
[00:24:25.879 --> 00:24:29.781]  And so I don't see this as me as being that important.
[00:24:30.541 --> 00:24:34.023]  I see it as I've been designated as a test case.
[00:24:34.683 --> 00:24:36.944]  And so they're like, well, we can't even get rid of the test case.
[00:24:37.084 --> 00:24:37.604]  Get him.
[00:24:39.045 --> 00:24:40.766]  They kind of see me as the first target.
[00:24:41.306 --> 00:24:55.261]   And so because I haven't fallen because of all your support, They just keep doubling down, doubling down, but now it's kind of like Stalingrad, where you've got 5 million Germans and 7 million Russians, and they just decided to slug it out in that one city.
[00:24:55.642 --> 00:25:06.007]  They could have fought anywhere in Russia, there were a bunch of other cities on the line, but the Russians and the Germans decided to slug it out at Stalingrad, and Alex Jones is basically Stalingrad.
[00:25:06.547 --> 00:25:08.648]  So it's not me, I'm just the chosen...
[00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:18.318]  Myself and Trump are the chosen battlegrounds in the social war, and they thought Trump's goofy, he can be discredited, Jones is goofy, and I am goofy.
[00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:21.821]  But it didn't work, because I am goofy, people realized I'm real.
[00:25:22.342 --> 00:25:29.168]  And so now, not even me, but my name, and who I am, has become this archetype of this tug-of-war battle.
[00:25:29.188 --> 00:25:29.749]  Does that make sense?
[00:25:31.383 --> 00:25:34.785]  I have a quick question that I'd like to ask Alex.
[00:25:35.185 --> 00:25:44.730]  You said that the judge reprimanded the attorneys for the Sandy Hook parents, or I'm sorry, yes, for the Sandy Hook plaintiffs.
[00:25:45.151 --> 00:25:48.693]  In what way did the judge reprimand them?
[00:25:48.753 --> 00:25:54.376]  Because I don't recall that in listening to that portion.
[00:25:54.456 --> 00:25:57.618]  So how did the judge reprimand that attorney?
[00:25:58.738 --> 00:25:59.939]  Did you listen to the whole eight hours?
[00:26:02.603 --> 00:26:02.843]  No.
[00:26:04.584 --> 00:26:06.144]  Well, he does it very elegantly.
[00:26:06.845 --> 00:26:08.705]  He told them, sit down, I've heard enough from you.
[00:26:10.546 --> 00:26:12.467]  He said, I'm not going to shut Alex Jones down.
[00:26:13.107 --> 00:26:14.988]  If you don't want money, I'm not going to shut him down.
[00:26:15.388 --> 00:26:16.148]  He followed the law.
[00:26:16.889 --> 00:26:18.589]  Because what they can get is money under their judgement.
[00:26:18.609 --> 00:26:19.970]  They don't want money, they want to shut me down.
[00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:33.042]   He, on both our motions, to not appoint a special Chapter 7 over me in my private bankruptcy or in InfoWars, They said, we pray.
[00:26:33.062 --> 00:26:34.843]  That's the ancient tongue.
[00:26:35.183 --> 00:26:36.103]  That's English coming along.
[00:26:36.683 --> 00:26:40.865]  We pray you don't give him his bank accounts back, and the judge did.
[00:26:42.326 --> 00:26:47.308]  So, if you don't know legal parlance, my lawyers or top lawyers said they've never seen such a slaughter.
[00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:52.090]  And you said that Donald Trump is aware of this.
[00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:56.212]  In what way do you think Donald Trump would be able to help you in this case?
[00:26:57.613 --> 00:27:00.334]  Well, Trump is the big lion with a thousand hyenas on him.
[00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.612]  I'm a smaller lion with 10 on me.
[00:27:03.213 --> 00:27:12.784]  So I don't, I didn't say, I said Trump, I may miss what you're saying, but Trump and the Republicans understand that I'm patient zero in this attack.
[00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:16.729]  So, uh, I don't know that I said Trump was going to help me in this.
[00:27:18.058 --> 00:27:18.878]  I think the judge did.
[00:27:18.958 --> 00:27:25.900]  No, you said that Donald Trump is aware and that this is happening because of the election.
[00:27:26.021 --> 00:27:30.742]  So in what way Donald Trump being elected, would that help you with this particular case?
[00:27:31.202 --> 00:27:33.083]  Yeah, but you said I said Donald Trump was going to help me.
[00:27:33.123 --> 00:27:33.623]  I didn't say that.
[00:27:33.923 --> 00:27:36.904]  No, I asked you in what way was Donald Trump going to assist.
[00:27:36.924 --> 00:27:37.964]  No, I'm trying to help Donald Trump.
[00:27:37.984 --> 00:27:39.065]  I'm trying to help America.
[00:27:39.105 --> 00:27:42.406]  I'm not here as a soldier in the information war on my own.
[00:27:43.066 --> 00:27:43.986]  Trump's the big general.
[00:27:44.066 --> 00:27:44.786]  I'm just a sergeant.
[00:27:47.071 --> 00:27:48.752]  I want to bring in, thanks Alex, I want to bring in Brian.
[00:27:48.991 --> 00:27:52.991]   The judge said, "Hopefully this all changes with an election."
[00:27:52.991 --> 00:27:56.750]   And the judge, people should go find, because there's a transcript, you're not supposed
[00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.431]  to record federal court, and I didn't record it.
[00:27:58.431 --> 00:27:59.471]  I know people probably did.
[00:27:59.471 --> 00:28:02.350]  But people need to go read the eight-hour transcript.
[00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:09.152]  I want to bring in, thanks Alex, I want to bring in Brian.
[00:28:09.152 --> 00:28:17.632]   Brian, you posted on Twitter, if I remember right, some not so very positive words about
[00:28:18.242 --> 00:28:22.024]  I think and I do correct me if this is not what you said because I didn't look at it a while ago.
[00:28:22.044 --> 00:28:22.864]  I don't really look at your page.
[00:28:23.364 --> 00:28:29.147]  Something along the lines of you doubt the veracity of Alex's claims.
[00:28:29.187 --> 00:28:29.627]  Is that right?
[00:28:29.647 --> 00:28:33.169]  Do you want to expand on whatever your point was if that wasn't your position?
[00:28:34.749 --> 00:28:37.511]  I'm sure I've said a lot over this last couple of years.
[00:28:37.611 --> 00:28:38.591]  Alex probably knows that.
[00:28:38.791 --> 00:28:39.411]  Go ahead!
[00:28:40.352 --> 00:28:47.070]   Yeah, so I guess My position is that you are... Can you hear me or no?
[00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.211]  Can you hear Krasnithine?
[00:28:49.892 --> 00:28:51.313]  No, I can't hear Krasnithine.
[00:28:51.453 --> 00:28:52.794]  Oh, God bless you.
[00:28:52.834 --> 00:28:54.075]  Anyway, Brian, I'll bring you back down.
[00:28:54.095 --> 00:28:54.675]  I'll bring you back up.
[00:28:55.235 --> 00:28:55.876]  I can hear him now.
[00:28:55.996 --> 00:28:56.817]  I heard him now.
[00:28:57.577 --> 00:28:58.458]  I'm going to bring him down.
[00:28:58.478 --> 00:28:59.198]  I'll bring him back up.
[00:28:59.539 --> 00:29:00.419]  Oh, he's gone.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.281]  God bless us all, maybe then.
[00:29:03.281 --> 00:29:03.942]  Jokes, Sarah.
[00:29:03.962 --> 00:29:04.222]  Jokes.
[00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:04.862]  I know it's your boy.
[00:29:05.163 --> 00:29:08.925]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:08.965 --> 00:29:11.227]  Go to everybody's favorite liberal, Jared.
[00:29:13.682 --> 00:29:14.663]  I want to go to that.
[00:29:15.243 --> 00:29:16.144]  Oh, no.
[00:29:17.185 --> 00:29:18.226]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:18.246 --> 00:29:20.248]  Brian, can you speak?
[00:29:20.288 --> 00:29:21.129]  See if Alex can hear you?
[00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.789]  Yeah.
[00:29:21.829 --> 00:29:23.031]  Hey, can you hear me, Alex?
[00:29:27.154 --> 00:29:28.095]  Alex, can you hear Brian?
[00:29:28.596 --> 00:29:29.036]  No, I can't.
[00:29:29.076 --> 00:29:29.837]  It's very strange.
[00:29:31.118 --> 00:29:32.139]  Are you sure?
[00:29:32.199 --> 00:29:33.220]  Are you sure you're not kidding?
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.382]  Let me put myself on hold and do it again.
[00:29:37.865 --> 00:29:38.065]  Okay.
[00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:42.231]  Should I drop you down, Alex, and bring you back up?
[00:29:42.712 --> 00:29:43.252]  Yeah, do that.
[00:29:44.033 --> 00:29:46.396]  Yeah, I'll drop Alex down and bring him back up.
[00:29:46.836 --> 00:29:47.978]  So it's removed from speakers.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.722]  And then I'll bring Alex back up.
[00:29:52.663 --> 00:29:58.501]  That way Brian will get a chance to ask his question.
[00:29:58.501 --> 00:30:11.862]   In the meantime, Sarah, I heard there's a some reminder you need to say while I'm bringing Alex up.
[00:30:13.837 --> 00:30:14.618]  Yes, yes.
[00:30:14.718 --> 00:30:15.579]  You're so good at it.
[00:30:15.599 --> 00:30:16.299]  You're the best at it.
[00:30:16.319 --> 00:30:17.340]  I am the best at that.
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:22.143]  Just a reminder to turn on your notifications for Mario.
[00:30:23.024 --> 00:30:24.205]  He does have a newsletter.
[00:30:24.225 --> 00:30:34.192]  It's pinned in the top and a Telegram channel, so be sure to subscribe to that for up-to-the-minute news and breaking spaces.
[00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:35.894]  Alex, are you able to hear now?
[00:30:36.465 --> 00:30:38.126]  Yeah, I hear you speaking.
[00:30:38.226 --> 00:30:38.627]  I hear Brian.
[00:30:38.647 --> 00:30:39.287]  Yeah, I hear him now.
[00:30:39.307 --> 00:30:39.668]  Go ahead.
[00:30:44.561 --> 00:30:46.803]  Hey, Alex.
[00:30:46.823 --> 00:30:51.425]  I have several questions, but I'll just limit it to one for time purposes.
[00:30:52.526 --> 00:31:09.936]  I've seen lately a lot of people on X and on other social media platforms claiming that since the creditors are coming after you and these people are coming after you for all this money, this crazy amount of money, that you must have been onto something when it came to Sandy Hook.
[00:31:11.088 --> 00:31:14.451]  In court, you admitted that you were wrong about Sandy Hook.
[00:31:14.591 --> 00:31:15.231]  I'm pretty sure.
[00:31:15.511 --> 00:31:16.432]  I'm pretty sure, right?
[00:31:17.172 --> 00:31:23.877]  Can you tell these people that you weren't going to do anything and that you clearly got it wrong when it came to the Sandy Hook victims?
[00:31:25.098 --> 00:31:26.939]  Yeah, Brian, I'm glad you bring this up.
[00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:29.961]  And again, I can call my house while I have Wi-Fi.
[00:31:30.381 --> 00:31:32.423]  I'm out here in my car just because my kids are running around.
[00:31:32.463 --> 00:31:33.544]  You guys getting good audio for me?
[00:31:34.884 --> 00:31:35.345]  Yeah, you're good.
[00:31:36.265 --> 00:31:38.547]  Okay, let me explain something, Brian, to you, okay?
[00:31:39.107 --> 00:31:39.888]  And this is the truth.
[00:31:41.207 --> 00:31:42.548]  I am not the Sandy Hook man.
[00:31:43.949 --> 00:31:45.390]  I did not make money off these people.
[00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:57.418]  They entered 22 minutes of evidence into the Texas and Connecticut trials that were completely choreographed, where I was already found guilty by judges in default, claiming I didn't give discovery, which was not true.
[00:31:57.458 --> 00:31:58.738]  I gave four years of discovery.
[00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:00.279]  They found nothing in there.
[00:32:00.299 --> 00:32:01.760]  I didn't make money off of them.
[00:32:02.181 --> 00:32:02.881]  That was a lie.
[00:32:03.201 --> 00:32:24.175]   Now, about a year into Sandy Hook, which was a blip on the radar, I'm sad it happened, There were professors in Florida and Wisconsin and California and a school safety official named Wolfgang Halbig that put out all this information claiming it didn't happen.
[00:32:25.455 --> 00:32:31.980]  I then, because it had hundreds of millions of views on YouTube, it was a huge story, did one debate and five shows on it.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.883]  Before they sued me, I didn't talk about it for over three years.
[00:32:37.384 --> 00:32:39.165]  I stopped having these people on.
[00:32:40.754 --> 00:32:46.216]  Because I learned they were either paid to act like this or they were crazy.
[00:32:46.936 --> 00:32:54.519]  They were going to like Catholic schools and stuff six, seven years ago before I got sued, believing the kids were still alive and doing all this stuff.
[00:32:54.599 --> 00:32:58.160]  And I learned some of the stuff they said was not true.
[00:32:59.241 --> 00:33:11.404]   So, so I was already saying and having debates with them seven, eight years ago before they sued me, Saying, no, I think Sandy Hook happened.
[00:33:12.144 --> 00:33:14.765]  Then the media went, oh, Jones is weak.
[00:33:14.825 --> 00:33:15.826]  He's backed off this.
[00:33:16.486 --> 00:33:17.847]  Let's claim he made this up.
[00:33:18.347 --> 00:33:33.179]   And they hired PR firms to run thousands of articles in 2016, 2017, 2018, before they sued me, claiming I was currently peeing on graves, going to their houses, sending people and I never did any of that and no evidence
[00:33:33.179 --> 00:33:34.680]  was put on about that.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.320]  So that's the reality.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:40.759]  So you tell me, get people to stop saying it didn't happen.
[00:33:40.759 --> 00:33:44.800]   They were saying it before I ever said, "Oh, I can see your point.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:49.080]   Yeah, they lied about WMDs, you know, all Jussie Smollett, all this.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.080]  Yeah, maybe it's fake."
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.000]  And I didn't say that in the current tense.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]  I'm repeating what I said earlier.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.799]  So I thought they literally wanted an apology.
[00:33:55.799 --> 00:33:58.400]  So I said, "Yeah, I think your kids died."
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.040]  They went, "Oh my God, we've got you."
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:12.762]  I mean, again, why do I have friends and people that go to foreign countries and they open up the newspaper in Japan and it's about my court case currently.
[00:34:13.362 --> 00:34:19.043]  It's like we're invading Iraq or something in 2003.
[00:34:19.703 --> 00:34:24.484]  Why is the number one thing on every channel for weeks, me and Sandy Hook?
[00:34:24.503 --> 00:34:29.864]   because it's about making me the Sandy Hook guy to make the popular Sandy Hook guy.
[00:34:29.864 --> 00:34:35.963]   And because everybody, most people don't trust the media and the government now, I see it everywhere.
[00:34:35.963 --> 00:34:39.083]  People mad at me saying, "Oh, they got to Jones."
[00:34:39.083 --> 00:34:42.103]  He's saying it happened.
[00:34:42.103 --> 00:34:45.804]  I said that five, six years ago, Brian.
[00:34:45.804 --> 00:34:49.222]  Just quick follow up.
[00:34:49.222 --> 00:34:51.862]  And I appreciate you giving me a response there.
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.101]  So, you were found liable.
[00:34:55.121 --> 00:35:00.582]  They gave a $1.4 billion reward, I believe.
[00:35:02.463 --> 00:35:07.064]  You do admit that you lied, you didn't tell the truth about Sandy Hook.
[00:35:07.284 --> 00:35:14.546]  Whether you got deceived by others, whether you didn't, it doesn't really matter because that defamation doesn't really follow that.
[00:35:15.197 --> 00:35:20.439]  But if you were to say, do you think you should pay them anything?
[00:35:20.739 --> 00:35:22.880]  And if so, what would be fair?
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:27.542]  Well, Brian, Brian, Brian, let's respond to your incredibly weasel-like statement.
[00:35:28.003 --> 00:35:28.683]  And you know, exactly.
[00:35:28.783 --> 00:35:30.023]  I'm asking you a simple question.
[00:35:30.364 --> 00:35:31.384]  No, no, no, no.
[00:35:31.424 --> 00:35:32.424]  You don't want the answer?
[00:35:32.444 --> 00:35:34.885]  Let him respond and you ask your question.
[00:35:35.046 --> 00:35:35.486]  Go ahead, Alex.
[00:35:36.206 --> 00:35:36.886]  Yeah, yeah, Brian.
[00:35:38.047 --> 00:35:42.858]   If I'm wrong about a stock market pick, Or I was wrong about Jussie Smollett.
[00:35:43.038 --> 00:35:45.140]  I said Jussie Smollett day one stage, and I was right.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:46.260]  Okay?
[00:35:47.461 --> 00:35:55.347]  So, if I'm wrong about something when I covered other people covering it, I'm not lying.
[00:35:56.127 --> 00:35:59.830]  I've never lied on purpose about news and information.
[00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:01.751]  But it was more than that, though.
[00:36:02.091 --> 00:36:02.992]  You're not letting me finish?
[00:36:03.012 --> 00:36:04.773]  You're not letting me finish?
[00:36:04.813 --> 00:36:07.495]  You have to admit you said more than just covering other people.
[00:36:07.535 --> 00:36:09.877]  You made statements as fact, right?
[00:36:11.092 --> 00:36:14.575]  Hey, why don't you restate your question again, because I forgot the second part.
[00:36:14.635 --> 00:36:15.615]  You're not letting me finish.
[00:36:16.396 --> 00:36:21.199]  It's not lying to say, yes, I thought there was some anomalies.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.440]  I thought it may not have happened.
[00:36:22.841 --> 00:36:23.641]  And then I questioned it.
[00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:25.763]  You try to keep me on the horns of that.
[00:36:26.203 --> 00:36:30.706]  When I said five, six years ago, before I was sued, that I thought it happened.
[00:36:30.826 --> 00:36:31.587]  I'm on record.
[00:36:32.167 --> 00:36:33.168]  I questioned it.
[00:36:33.308 --> 00:36:34.609]  It was my First Amendment right.
[00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:36.631]  This is all about destroying the First Amendment.
[00:36:37.351 --> 00:36:38.012]  I explained that.
[00:36:38.092 --> 00:36:39.633]  Now to answer your second question.
[00:36:40.854 --> 00:36:51.961]  They have spent, in the bankruptcy hearing alone, they have filed in federal court $34 million in two years trying to find me in a crime to put me in jail.
[00:36:52.301 --> 00:36:53.782]  They're so pissed I'm clean.
[00:36:54.463 --> 00:37:04.749]  They spent $25 million in the four years previous prosecuting their lawsuits and claimed in court I had hundreds of millions of dollars hidden.
[00:37:04.769 --> 00:37:05.570]  Remember all that?
[00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:06.951]  I was going to go to jail.
[00:37:07.591 --> 00:37:08.532]  None of that was true.
[00:37:09.122 --> 00:37:12.003]  The judge has seen the private investigations he put in.
[00:37:12.483 --> 00:37:13.443]  I've been through the whole ringer.
[00:37:13.683 --> 00:37:14.543]  None of it was true.
[00:37:15.283 --> 00:37:42.088]   This has been a giant media extravaganza and the whole Sandy Hook combine of PR firms, Democratic Party, has used me for years in Facebook and Google and Twitter and X ads to raise money off my name To take a popular talk show host who was already number one six years ago and take a few things I said out of context to maybe the Sandy Hook man so they own my identity and raise money off of me.
[00:37:42.508 --> 00:37:47.514]  They didn't want to take $55 million in a settlement, which is more money than I've ever made personally.
[00:37:47.995 --> 00:37:49.957]  And the judge talked about that Friday.
[00:37:50.566 --> 00:38:02.031]  They want to use me as the bad guy, as the villain coming after them to raise political contributions to their gun control groups.
[00:38:02.531 --> 00:38:04.932]  And that's the truth, Mr. Krasnistin.
[00:38:06.513 --> 00:38:09.294]  Brian, let me ask you a question.
[00:38:09.615 --> 00:38:17.378]  When you're reporting, I mean, sometimes, obviously, I agree, someone might be doing it deceptively, but sometimes you can just get the information wrong, right?
[00:38:17.418 --> 00:38:26.115]   Like, I don't know which one of you two brothers, but didn't you guys Did any of you guys claim that there was an Iranian passport or didn't one of you guys claim that there was Jihad day or something?
[00:38:26.135 --> 00:38:34.143]  So like, doesn't sometimes happen that a person gets misinformation or it relays the information in a manner that they think isn't problematic but could be problematic?
[00:38:35.121 --> 00:38:52.033]  So the way defamation works is that if you go out of your way to say something that's not true, and you know it's not true, or you maliciously attack them, or if you didn't take the proper precautions in reporting it.
[00:38:52.753 --> 00:38:57.256]  I mean, Jones clearly stated that Sandy Hook was a false flag operation.
[00:38:57.296 --> 00:38:59.298]  He didn't say, these people are saying it.
[00:38:59.698 --> 00:39:02.980]  He said, Sandy Hook was a false flag operation.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.061]  Let me ask you this question.
[00:39:04.659 --> 00:39:05.519]  Because you didn't answer me.
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:13.022]  Are you denying that in Texas and Connecticut, the judges found me guilty by default and then had show trials damages?
[00:39:13.082 --> 00:39:13.802]  Are you denying?
[00:39:15.503 --> 00:39:16.543]  You mean liable, right?
[00:39:16.583 --> 00:39:16.824]  Not guilty.
[00:39:16.864 --> 00:39:20.525]  No, the judges found me guilty without a jury.
[00:39:20.565 --> 00:39:21.645]  And let me go further.
[00:39:22.326 --> 00:39:25.927]  Who should we get in trouble for lying about WMDs?
[00:39:26.559 --> 00:39:29.041]  Which both Democrat and Republican Party weren't known was true.
[00:39:29.541 --> 00:39:32.723]  See, you guys sit there and act like I... No, but that's a separate situation, though.
[00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:39.908]  Saying that the federal government did something is different than saying that these children that died... Listen, listen, listen.
[00:39:40.088 --> 00:39:41.389]  I don't want to talk about this.
[00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.971]  I was invited on the show to talk about this.
[00:39:43.991 --> 00:39:45.732]  Well, I'm just trying to explain the difference.
[00:39:45.792 --> 00:39:50.035]  I mean, there's a clear difference in saying, oh, the federal government... Krasnostein, Krasnostein, listen to me.
[00:39:50.095 --> 00:39:55.059]  You asked, you asked, Krasnostein, you asked, Krasnostein, you asked a question.
[00:39:56.087 --> 00:40:00.069]  Do I feel like they should be paid money?
[00:40:00.469 --> 00:40:06.252]  No, I believe this is all a political thing to demonize the First Amendment and scare other people from asking questions about future narratives.
[00:40:06.292 --> 00:40:26.503]   That said, I offered them $55 million three months ago, more money than I've ever made in my life, certified by federal court in 30 years on air, $55 million that I would try to pay them over 10 years And they said, we don't want your money on the courthouse.
[00:40:26.543 --> 00:40:29.647]  They said, we want him shut down.
[00:40:30.007 --> 00:40:32.149]  So you said, oh, do they owe anything?
[00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.191]  They don't want $55 million.
[00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:40.338]  They want me silenced because they don't want people to be able to hear what I have to say for future narratives.
[00:40:40.598 --> 00:40:43.380]  When they launch a nuclear war, or a false flag.
[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:44.240]  Who's they?
[00:40:44.501 --> 00:40:46.042]  They is the families.
[00:40:46.082 --> 00:40:46.902]  Oh, the families!
[00:40:46.982 --> 00:40:48.623]  It's a Democrat party law firm.
[00:40:48.663 --> 00:40:49.244]  Excuse me, why is that?
[00:40:49.304 --> 00:40:51.065]  I didn't care about what you had to say.
[00:40:51.225 --> 00:40:53.586]  No, they didn't want... Listen, say it's the families.
[00:40:54.007 --> 00:40:55.488]  They didn't want $55 million.
[00:40:56.428 --> 00:40:57.609]  They didn't want $55 million.
[00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:00.311]  They say, I won't pay the money.
[00:41:00.331 --> 00:41:01.732]  $55 million, they said no.
[00:41:01.772 --> 00:41:02.852]  I've talked to Krasinski enough.
[00:41:03.853 --> 00:41:07.996]  Weren't they asking for $85 million in November, according to the AP?
[00:41:08.908 --> 00:41:12.730]  They offered to settle for $85 million, that is the Sandy Hook families.
[00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:18.333]  $85 million over 10 years, with 50% of anything earned over $9 million.
[00:41:18.353 --> 00:41:21.615]  So it sounds like you guys were close to a settlement.
[00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:27.057]  Yes or no?
[00:41:27.118 --> 00:41:28.719]  Is that correct or incorrect?
[00:41:28.859 --> 00:41:29.559]  Alex has dropped.
[00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:31.100]  I think he's got technical issues.
[00:41:32.741 --> 00:41:35.463]  So, Suli, I'll respond to you.
[00:41:37.105 --> 00:41:46.591]  So there's a difference in saying something about WMD to the government, about the government, or are you saying when the government lied about WMD?
[00:41:46.931 --> 00:41:49.253]  Yeah, because Alex's argument is this, Brian.
[00:41:49.353 --> 00:41:50.494]  Alex's argument is this.
[00:41:50.614 --> 00:41:56.865]   He's saying that basically your or many others, many people who disagree with him are magnifying
[00:41:56.865 --> 00:42:01.746]   the fact that he, according to him, reported incorrectly, according to you,
[00:42:01.746 --> 00:42:05.956]   lied about an incident, the Sandy Hook incident happening and that it was fake. And
[00:42:05.956 --> 00:42:13.506]   his argument is that actually, we've seen during our times much more significant, deadly
[00:42:13.506 --> 00:42:20.756]   lies, such as the WMDs, which took the lives of millions of people in the Middle
[00:42:20.756 --> 00:42:26.786]   East, and yet there has been no action for those people who lied.
[00:42:26.982 --> 00:42:29.965]  There's been no trials for those people who lied.
[00:42:30.265 --> 00:42:31.546]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:42:31.586 --> 00:42:32.466]  Massive coverage.
[00:42:34.921 --> 00:42:37.287]  Massive non-stop coverage of Alex Jones.
[00:42:37.628 --> 00:42:38.570]  He's the only devil.
[00:42:38.771 --> 00:42:39.453]  So let's say this.
[00:42:39.733 --> 00:42:40.555]  I didn't do it on purpose.
[00:42:40.595 --> 00:42:41.458]  I'm not a bad person.
[00:42:41.478 --> 00:42:43.282]  I just question things.
[00:42:43.322 --> 00:42:44.204]  Let's just say I'm Satan.
[00:42:44.756 --> 00:42:45.717]  I didn't kill anybody.
[00:42:46.078 --> 00:42:48.000]  Why aren't we talking about the COVID shots?
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.702]  Why aren't we talking about the fentanyl?
[00:42:50.002 --> 00:42:51.284]  Why aren't we talking about the human trafficking?
[00:42:51.544 --> 00:42:53.246]  Why aren't we talking about the millions dead in Iraq?
[00:42:53.606 --> 00:42:55.589]  Why aren't we... You know, it's all about Alex Jones!
[00:42:55.609 --> 00:42:57.371]  They're not mutually exclusive though.
[00:42:57.391 --> 00:42:58.852]  You can talk about it all, you know?
[00:42:58.872 --> 00:43:03.097]  Like, it's... They did that... Who's going to trial... No, Brian, the argument isn't this.
[00:43:03.157 --> 00:43:05.340]  It's not about... So, who's going to trial...
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.682]  Yeah, but at some point, can we move on from Crazzy Steen?
[00:43:09.722 --> 00:43:11.143]  Can we go to Chase Geyser or somebody else?
[00:43:10.963 --> 00:43:15.523]   the reason behind it, but who, like, because no one has, what his argument is, is, by the
[00:43:15.523 --> 00:43:18.003]   way, I'm just trying to relay his argument and I'll let you respond to it because that's
[00:43:18.003 --> 00:43:19.003]  between you two.
[00:43:19.003 --> 00:43:21.283]  Yeah, but at some point, can we move on from Krause's thing?
[00:43:21.283 --> 00:43:25.882]   You got to like Chase Geyser or somebody else, because I don't mind, but Krause's team just
[00:43:25.882 --> 00:43:26.882]  isn't enough.
[00:43:26.882 --> 00:43:27.883]  Yeah, Chase is not here.
[00:43:27.883 --> 00:43:28.883]  Tell him to request, I'll bring him up.
[00:43:28.883 --> 00:43:32.083]   Go ahead, Brian, I'll let you finish, you can make your last point.
[00:43:32.083 --> 00:43:33.363]  But you get the argument, yeah, Brian?
[00:43:33.363 --> 00:43:40.243]   I get the argument, but you're basing your argument off of something the government did
[00:43:40.243 --> 00:43:45.843]  versus what a private citizen did in a defamation case.
[00:43:43.616 --> 00:43:44.217]  Exactly!
[00:43:44.277 --> 00:43:47.720]  Why don't we have the government in trouble for lying on purpose, on record?
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:48.721]  Both should be true.
[00:43:49.282 --> 00:43:50.323]  Both can be true, right?
[00:43:50.623 --> 00:43:53.906]  Yeah, but why am I focused on thousands of articles a day?
[00:43:54.247 --> 00:43:57.850]  Why doesn't the media cover lies about WMDs or lies about poison shots?
[00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:59.311]  That was 15 years ago, though.
[00:44:01.333 --> 00:44:03.234]  Oh, Gain of Function was 15 years ago?
[00:44:03.514 --> 00:44:05.254]  The COVID lockdowns were 15 years ago?
[00:44:05.794 --> 00:44:08.875]  You're just distracting from the... No, I'm not distracting!
[00:44:08.915 --> 00:44:10.395]  You're distracting me, Brian, though.
[00:44:10.795 --> 00:44:14.536]  Why is time... Why is there a limitation on time?
[00:44:14.576 --> 00:44:16.737]  Again, so that's what we... If you want to interview with Krasny, you can go ahead.
[00:44:16.777 --> 00:44:19.497]  But you're just distracting from the whole point of the conversation.
[00:44:20.178 --> 00:44:22.058]  Just follow me on Real Alex Jones, folks.
[00:44:22.098 --> 00:44:23.118]  You'll hear what I'm actually saying.
[00:44:23.398 --> 00:44:25.639]  Krasny, it must be good to serve the devil.
[00:44:25.999 --> 00:44:27.159]  Okay, okay.
[00:44:27.439 --> 00:44:28.500]  We're just going to go to someone else.
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:29.960]  Krasny, you got your point across.
[00:44:30.461 --> 00:44:32.962]  Let me go to Chase.
[00:44:32.982 --> 00:44:38.544]  Chase, I mean, I think your part of info was as well when you... Chase wasn't in the court.
[00:44:38.584 --> 00:44:40.865]  That's one of the... Chase, you were there for eight hours.
[00:44:40.905 --> 00:44:41.405]  What'd you see?
[00:44:41.985 --> 00:44:42.185]  Yeah.
[00:44:43.286 --> 00:44:46.427]  Yeah, it was the first time I've ever been in a courtroom like that.
[00:44:46.467 --> 00:44:48.107]  So it was an amazing experience.
[00:44:48.628 --> 00:44:50.588]  Some of it was really boring, as you'd imagine.
[00:44:50.628 --> 00:44:52.269]  Other parts of it were very riveting.
[00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:59.395]  And Alex said it best earlier in this space, the final speech from the judge was a lot like the end of To Kill a Mockingbird.
[00:44:59.435 --> 00:45:00.136]  It was emotional.
[00:45:00.376 --> 00:45:04.840]  I believe the judge lost his father in the last few months and he was upset that it was Father's Day coming up.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:20.283]   I mean, it was a very solemn, serious, edge of your seat kind of dynamic and ultimately It's very obvious that the plaintiffs in this case, whether they're right or wrong, that that issue is a side issue.
[00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:28.630]  It's very obvious that their desire is to make it impossible for Alex to be on the air in any way, shape or form.
[00:45:29.071 --> 00:45:35.176]  So they filed a motion, for example, to try to take his personal Twitter account, which is basically unprecedented as far as I understand it.
[00:45:35.931 --> 00:45:42.817]  And yes, it is the case that they offer an $85 million deal with, you know, all sorts of stipulations that were untenable for us.
[00:45:42.897 --> 00:45:56.470]  And we counted with 55, but ultimately it's very obvious that if they're spending millions upon millions of dollars and we're trying to settle with them and they want to liquidate everything for less than 10 or less than $5 million worth of gear and hardware.
[00:45:57.068 --> 00:46:00.050]  here that the objective is to silence Alex.
[00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:18.059]  So, regardless of what you think about Alex or his statements in the past, or whether he got the story wrong, or whether he was intentionally lying, regardless of what you think about that, I do think that there is a real issue here when the civil courts can be used to totally eradicate a person's ability to speak to an audience that wants to hear what they have to say.
[00:46:18.499 --> 00:46:26.023]  That's what's so troubling to me about this, regardless of all of the emotional details and issues around this case.
[00:46:26.563 --> 00:46:33.109]  Chase, what were the terms that were untenable as far as the $85 million suit?
[00:46:33.189 --> 00:46:34.771]  You did a good job breaking this down.
[00:46:35.311 --> 00:46:36.012]  We didn't record it.
[00:46:36.212 --> 00:46:36.992]  I wish it was out there.
[00:46:37.473 --> 00:46:39.234]  How many times did the judge explain?
[00:46:39.254 --> 00:46:43.018]  Remember them saying two weeks ago, nobody's shutting it down, Alex is making it up?
[00:46:43.518 --> 00:46:45.520]  They then, the plaintiffs, the U.S.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.262]  trustee, all of them admitted we're trying to shut him down.
[00:46:48.803 --> 00:46:52.346]  Right now they said guns in the building, like we're terrorists.
[00:46:52.406 --> 00:46:53.367]  I mean, this was insane.
[00:46:56.593 --> 00:46:57.034]  Absolutely.
[00:46:57.134 --> 00:47:07.205]  And Alex could speak on this better than I could, but Sarah, to answer your question, I believe they wanted to put a board of directors in here, for example, to manage the company and sort of dictate what Alex could say or not say on air.
[00:47:07.545 --> 00:47:11.830]  That's the type of stuff that we specifically, Alex, was unwilling to tolerate.
[00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:13.352]  But Alex, please correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:47:13.392 --> 00:47:15.134]  A board of directors to run InfoWars?
[00:47:15.194 --> 00:47:15.674]  Is that correct?
[00:47:18.422 --> 00:47:20.363]  To my lawyers outside of mediation.
[00:47:20.884 --> 00:47:23.506]  They said, listen, we want you to not defend the Second Amendment.
[00:47:23.546 --> 00:47:25.407]  And I said, tell them what else they want.
[00:47:25.447 --> 00:47:26.027]  I wanted to see.
[00:47:26.548 --> 00:47:27.749]  And it was, well, we'll give you a big list.
[00:47:27.789 --> 00:47:29.530]  So it was basically, I would become their creature.
[00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:30.451]  No money.
[00:47:30.851 --> 00:47:31.892]  Keep it forward going.
[00:47:32.532 --> 00:47:35.234]  And then they would just let me operate as long as they had a board of directors.
[00:47:35.594 --> 00:47:38.236]  That's the scandal that Kravitz's team doesn't want to talk about.
[00:47:38.256 --> 00:47:40.918]  They literally wanted me to be their creature.
[00:47:41.562 --> 00:47:44.205]  So at the end of the day, that's what happened.
[00:47:44.645 --> 00:47:45.546]  And that's what they did.
[00:47:45.586 --> 00:47:47.728]  The judge said, I'm not shutting down Alex Jones.
[00:47:48.228 --> 00:47:49.409]  I'm not doing this for you.
[00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:53.813]  So finally, we had an honest judge that said, no, this is tyranny, folks.
[00:47:54.674 --> 00:47:57.857]  I mean, tell him a few other observations, Chase, because you're really good at explaining it.
[00:47:58.157 --> 00:47:59.519]  You're only in the room like four hours.
[00:47:59.559 --> 00:48:02.742]  You're outside doing interviews.
[00:48:02.762 --> 00:48:11.329]   How many times did you see the judge say, Alex Jones owns this, and the CRO Hey Alex, I'm more than happy to talk to you about any of those things you want to talk about.
[00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:13.590]  I didn't come here to talk about those though, but go ahead.
[00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:15.010]  I mean, this was happening.
[00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:19.209]   Hey Alex, I'm more than happy to talk to you about any of those things you want to talk
[00:48:19.209 --> 00:48:20.209]  about.
[00:48:20.209 --> 00:48:22.210]  I didn't come here to talk about those though, but go ahead.
[00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:24.810]  No, I mean, I was like, it's ridiculous.
[00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:26.730]  A quick point of information question for you, Alex.
[00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:30.010]   I mean, the judge woke up to it and the media didn't know how to spin it.
[00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:31.690]  You got any comments on that, Chase?
[00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:32.690]  We'll go to the next person.
[00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:35.010]  Hey, just really quickly, Chase.
[00:48:35.108 --> 00:48:36.650]  Alex, can you hear other speakers?
[00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:37.572]  I guess Chase is gone.
[00:48:38.012 --> 00:48:39.254]  No, he can't hear me.
[00:48:39.274 --> 00:48:40.095]  I'm still here.
[00:48:40.115 --> 00:48:40.255]  Sully?
[00:48:40.295 --> 00:48:46.644]  Chase, what other observations about, hey, how many people hated me versus the crowd showing up to support us?
[00:48:47.025 --> 00:48:47.866]  That's what they're scared of.
[00:48:49.468 --> 00:48:51.029]  That was certainly an observation.
[00:48:51.049 --> 00:48:55.813]  19 out of 20 people that saw us were very supportive of Alex.
[00:48:56.174 --> 00:48:59.296]  I didn't realize, Alex, how popular you were until we went to Detroit this weekend.
[00:48:59.717 --> 00:49:01.838]  I couldn't believe how you were swarmed in every public place.
[00:49:01.919 --> 00:49:07.163]  Alex and I, I've been working for Alex for a year now, and I've never actually been in public with Alex, just at work.
[00:49:07.703 --> 00:49:09.525]  And it was really astounding to see.
[00:49:09.565 --> 00:49:11.026]  It was almost like rock star level stuff.
[00:49:11.447 --> 00:49:13.428]  And I arranged that to let the globalists know.
[00:49:13.448 --> 00:49:14.189]  They already know this.
[00:49:14.622 --> 00:49:15.262]  They've lost.
[00:49:15.643 --> 00:49:21.087]  And it wasn't just the TPUSA with Trump and JD Van, so that was a great inside baseball.
[00:49:21.667 --> 00:49:25.070]  It was, what, in the bars, on the street with black folks.
[00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:29.053]  I mean, look, you say 19 out of 20, one person said, I hope you kill yourself.
[00:49:29.573 --> 00:49:30.694]  Everything else was love.
[00:49:30.994 --> 00:49:31.334]  So it was 1,000 to 1.
[00:49:33.581 --> 00:49:36.643]  Hey Alex, a quick point of factual clarification.
[00:49:37.264 --> 00:49:40.066]  Alright, well, Millie Weaver, I haven't talked to her in 3-4 years.
[00:49:40.086 --> 00:49:41.207]  She's been an InfoWars reporter.
[00:49:41.227 --> 00:49:42.948]  I don't think he can hear you, Michael.
[00:49:43.128 --> 00:49:44.109]  I don't think he can hear you, Michael.
[00:49:44.149 --> 00:49:45.070]  Can you hear me?
[00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:46.491]  Michael, I'll drop you down and bring you back up.
[00:49:46.531 --> 00:49:47.992]  Let me go to Angelo.
[00:49:48.112 --> 00:49:48.913]  Angelo, go ahead, jump in.
[00:49:50.494 --> 00:49:51.855]  Hey, thanks for bringing me up.
[00:49:52.436 --> 00:49:57.620]  I'm kinda coming off of a 102 degree fever, so you're gonna have to forgive me, but... Stand here, Angelo.
[00:49:58.941 --> 00:49:59.741]  Oh, you can't hear me?
[00:50:00.662 --> 00:50:01.483]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[00:50:06.171 --> 00:50:07.912]  I don't hear Dan or Angelo.
[00:50:08.772 --> 00:50:09.853]  Hey, can you hear me?
[00:50:10.073 --> 00:50:11.354]  We can drop the speakers.
[00:50:11.394 --> 00:50:12.654]  He can't hear anybody.
[00:50:12.754 --> 00:50:17.477]  Angelo, were you going to make a general point or did you want to specifically ask Alex a question?
[00:50:17.317 --> 00:50:18.317]  He can't hear us.
[00:50:18.317 --> 00:50:20.317]  Let me leave again and come back.
[00:50:20.317 --> 00:50:21.317]  I'll go now.
[00:50:21.317 --> 00:50:22.317]  Yeah, no problem.
[00:50:22.317 --> 00:50:23.317]  Let me leave.
[00:50:23.317 --> 00:50:28.317]   Angelo, were you going to make a general point or did you want to specifically ask
[00:50:28.317 --> 00:50:29.317]  Alex a question?
[00:50:29.317 --> 00:50:37.317]   Well, I wanted to make a point, not specifically ask Alex a question, but I hear what everybody
[00:50:37.317 --> 00:50:43.597]   is saying and I'm not really fully in tune with the whole controversy and the court case
[00:50:43.597 --> 00:50:50.597]   and all that, but I will say that this axiom by which the deep state is going after Alex
[00:50:50.597 --> 00:50:53.117]  Jones on the Sandy Hook thing.
[00:50:53.473 --> 00:51:00.278]  It doesn't really matter whether or not there are suspicious aspects or whether or not Alex specifically targeted the victims of Sandy Hook.
[00:51:00.438 --> 00:51:03.140]  He did not, and there are suspicious aspects of Sandy Hook.
[00:51:03.881 --> 00:51:13.708]  You know, whether it's the evacuation drills that don't make sense with the official footage that was recorded or the bulldozing of the site or the alleged shooter, anything like that.
[00:51:14.068 --> 00:51:15.289]  That's really besides the point.
[00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:20.073]  What really matters is this is a direction by which the Deep State is trying to take down Alex Jones.
[00:51:20.833 --> 00:51:21.714]  And so long as...
[00:51:22.253 --> 00:51:30.762]  That is the perfect example, everyone, on why InfoWars is so dangerous, using the First Amendment to protect itself.
[00:51:30.902 --> 00:51:40.172]  Because if you really look at, we're all missing the fact, we're talking deep state, CIA, blah blah blah, look at my right hand while everything that's important is in my left.
[00:51:41.314 --> 00:51:49.221]  Number one, Alex Jones created a video after the Sandy Hook shooting, and that video, he stated that Sandy Hook was a false flag attack.
[00:51:49.621 --> 00:51:55.946]  He edited video, put video clips together, and he made it look like it was a false flag attack.
[00:51:56.747 --> 00:52:04.473]  And then that video went viral, and many people started believing Sandy Hook was a false flag attack, when in fact it was not.
[00:52:05.274 --> 00:52:11.145]   And this, that specific action, is what Who decides?
[00:52:11.245 --> 00:52:12.446]  Who decides what's disinformation?
[00:52:12.266 --> 00:52:16.746]   should be about. It doesn't matter if they're just out to get them to shut down Infowars.
[00:52:16.746 --> 00:52:22.865]   As long as we have someone using their platform to spread disinformation to millions of people...
[00:52:22.865 --> 00:52:29.865]   Who decides what's disinformation? That's the problem. Let me respond. Let me respond.
[00:52:29.865 --> 00:52:34.666]   I'm almost there, may I have 30 more seconds? You're full of crap.
[00:52:34.702 --> 00:52:36.403]  I want you to show you're a liar.
[00:52:36.503 --> 00:52:37.303]  I want to respond.
[00:52:37.624 --> 00:52:37.904]  Go ahead.
[00:52:37.944 --> 00:52:38.524]  Wrap up your point.
[00:52:38.544 --> 00:52:38.724]  Done.
[00:52:39.184 --> 00:52:39.485]  Okay.
[00:52:39.925 --> 00:52:48.029]  And to end my point, I mean, the main thing is the whole purpose of this was because that misinformation impacted the victim's families.
[00:52:48.509 --> 00:52:51.350]  And if he wants to pretend he's innocent, I mean, that's totally cool.
[00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:54.972]  I actually had a list of six questions that were not meant from a place of malice.
[00:52:54.992 --> 00:53:00.255]  They're just questions to which people wanted to know the answers, such as, um, let's see.
[00:53:00.953 --> 00:53:06.836]  No, I want to respond to the lie you already said.
[00:53:06.856 --> 00:53:07.937]  Let me respond first.
[00:53:09.638 --> 00:53:15.140]  It is on record that in the first year, I didn't say it didn't happen.
[00:53:15.601 --> 00:53:21.324]  And he just lied and said, I created a video that created everybody questioning it.
[00:53:21.644 --> 00:53:23.285]  No, there were hundreds of millions of views.
[00:53:23.765 --> 00:53:24.545]  And let me finish.
[00:53:25.126 --> 00:53:28.287]  There were hundreds of videos with hundreds of millions of views.
[00:53:28.347 --> 00:53:29.428]  Someone had 100 million apiece.
[00:53:30.277 --> 00:53:38.361]  Literally, 50 million, 20 million that were questioning everything that happened and everything that unfolded.
[00:53:38.681 --> 00:53:41.162]  That is all I did was cover the internet.
[00:53:41.363 --> 00:53:45.965]  I am not the first person that questioned Sandy Hook.
[00:53:46.285 --> 00:53:48.446]  And I have a right to do that.
[00:53:48.766 --> 00:53:52.388]  But he just lied and said, Mr. Jones created this.
[00:53:53.087 --> 00:53:54.328]  Mr. Jones did this.
[00:53:54.368 --> 00:54:04.856]  Now, I've since learned what really happened, and if you guys want to hear it, I've mentioned it for 30 seconds two weeks ago, and they flipped out and called and said, we'll settle.
[00:54:05.257 --> 00:54:05.637]  Stop.
[00:54:05.997 --> 00:54:06.378]  Stop.
[00:54:06.658 --> 00:54:07.218]  Don't say it.
[00:54:07.238 --> 00:54:08.739]  Because I learned what really happened.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:16.686]  Real kids were killed, and it's in the police report, and the truth is so horrible, you can't even believe it.
[00:54:17.046 --> 00:54:18.227]  It's in the police report.
[00:54:19.184 --> 00:54:27.735]  That the police and EMS got there and they opened the bathroom door and there was a pile of dead kids perfectly piled up, a pyramid, and there was no blood.
[00:54:28.931 --> 00:54:33.135]  And it's in the police report that they said the kids must have been moved there.
[00:54:33.735 --> 00:54:34.636]  I was saying that.
[00:54:34.736 --> 00:54:36.037]  Men in the woods in camo.
[00:54:36.317 --> 00:54:37.018]  Helicopters.
[00:54:37.118 --> 00:54:37.819]  Police drills.
[00:54:37.939 --> 00:54:38.379]  I don't know.
[00:54:38.659 --> 00:54:41.782]  They killed real kids and brought them to that closed school.
[00:54:42.082 --> 00:54:43.444]  And I said that the first year.
[00:54:43.764 --> 00:54:51.831]  And then the CIA, I believe, and 4chan put out the fake thing that nobody died so I would pick it up and set me up, just like with Pizzagate.
[00:54:52.614 --> 00:55:04.522]  When it was in the actual documents of WikiLeaks with Aleister Crowley Rituals and John Podesta at farmhouses with pools with seven-year-old kids delivered for his enjoyment.
[00:55:04.783 --> 00:55:05.703]  It's in the emails.
[00:55:06.284 --> 00:55:09.766]  And then they said, oh, it's a pizza place in D.C.
[00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:12.268]  That's where they do it because it wasn't happening there.
[00:55:12.588 --> 00:55:14.109]  I only cover what was being covered.
[00:55:14.489 --> 00:55:18.953]  And they turned around and said that I was sending people the pizza place and that I said it.
[00:55:18.993 --> 00:55:22.075]  No, I covered CNN and The New York Times saying the pizza place.
[00:55:22.575 --> 00:55:24.156]  Hey Alex, can I just ask you a very factual clarification?
[00:55:23.996 --> 00:55:29.695]   its nest acts like its wing is broken. So you don't find its nest. That got set up
[00:55:29.695 --> 00:55:34.816]   in Sandy Hook. They killed real children. And the police report and the EMT said they
[00:55:34.816 --> 00:55:40.456]   went into a closed school and found a pile of dead bodies with no blood. That is in the
[00:55:40.456 --> 00:55:45.256]   police report and they are scared of that and they don't want that covered. And I got
[00:55:45.256 --> 00:55:46.735]  set up and it's coming out.
[00:55:46.735 --> 00:55:53.735]   I want to ask you a very factual clarification. Alex, in one of the reports...
[00:55:53.735 --> 00:55:55.635]  Okay, hold on, hold on really quick.
[00:55:55.528 --> 00:55:57.089]  I'm about to blow your guys' minds.
[00:55:57.790 --> 00:56:07.137]  I truly believe that there was a PSYOP that was targeting the Sandy Hook families as well as InfoWars, Alex Jones, and the many people, like Alex was saying.
[00:56:07.577 --> 00:56:19.087]  I mean, this was a story that the whole internet was paying attention to, and the internet was calling out the many irregularities and things that were wrong with the reporting on this story.
[00:56:19.827 --> 00:56:26.851]  Here, those of you guys who have your computers in front of you, I want you to look up the name Jonathan Lee Riches.
[00:56:27.491 --> 00:56:31.073]  Type in Jonathan Lee Riches and Sandy Hook.
[00:56:31.313 --> 00:56:32.734]  Your mind is going to be blown.
[00:56:32.854 --> 00:56:42.058]  So a man named Jonathan Lee Riches, he actually showed up to the memorial site and he claimed that he was actually Adam Lazza's uncle.
[00:56:42.719 --> 00:56:43.039]  Okay?
[00:56:43.179 --> 00:56:46.060]  And he did all these interviews in the media.
[00:56:46.179 --> 00:56:52.558]   He was photographed by all these media outlets, kneeling in prayer in front of the vigil.
[00:56:52.558 --> 00:56:56.118]   And all these people were looking at these interviews and they're like, "This doesn't
[00:56:56.118 --> 00:56:57.118]  seem right.
[00:56:57.118 --> 00:56:58.118]  Something seems off here."
[00:56:58.118 --> 00:56:59.118]  Right?
[00:56:59.118 --> 00:57:04.038]   And that's partly what led a lot of people to actually go down this path of, "This seems
[00:57:04.038 --> 00:57:05.038]  weird.
[00:57:05.038 --> 00:57:06.038]  This seems staged.
[00:57:06.038 --> 00:57:07.038]  Something's not right here."
[00:57:07.038 --> 00:57:08.038]  Okay?
[00:57:08.038 --> 00:57:11.759]   And that just ended up getting buried and no one ever, I guess you could say, fact-checked
[00:57:12.021 --> 00:57:14.564]  There was no loud announcement that that happened.
[00:57:14.924 --> 00:57:28.816]   But also, just to prove that this Jonathan Lee Riches is a character involved in many psyops on the people, He actually was involved in a PSYOP, if you look up his name again, Jonathan Lee Riches and George Floyd.
[00:57:29.396 --> 00:57:36.659]  He actually was involved in a PSYOP where he posted a photo of himself wearing Make White Great Again as a MAGA hat.
[00:57:37.179 --> 00:57:42.401]  That photo, he claimed in the post on social media, he claimed that he was Derek Chauvin.
[00:57:42.661 --> 00:57:46.099]  the officer that knelt on George Floyd's neck.
[00:57:46.099 --> 00:57:51.900]   And people circulated the image saying, "Look, the officer that knelt on George Floyd
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:55.840]  was a white Trump supporter that was racist."
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:58.079]  And the tweet was so viral.
[00:57:58.079 --> 00:57:59.581]  No, this is not off.
[00:57:59.581 --> 00:58:00.840]  This is insanity.
[00:58:00.974 --> 00:58:02.274]  Can we end it?
[00:58:02.294 --> 00:58:07.316]  Can we just have a constant monologue from InfoWars people, or can we actually have a dialogue?
[00:58:07.516 --> 00:58:15.278]  No, I'm referencing things that you can look up to where you can actually see that there are psyops actors out there.
[00:58:15.338 --> 00:58:16.418]  Just let her finish her point.
[00:58:16.919 --> 00:58:19.860]  Let her finish her point.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.780]  One second, Millie.
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:23.741]  Okay, Millie, maybe you can't hear anybody.
[00:58:24.281 --> 00:58:27.282]  Millie, I'm gonna let you finish, but just like wrap your point up in 30 seconds.
[00:58:27.302 --> 00:58:27.542]  Go ahead.
[00:58:28.365 --> 00:58:46.579]  Okay, my point is that there are PSYOPs actors out there who have been engaged, and if you look them up, like Jonathan Lee Riches, he's in a multitude of different PSYOPs, and he did play a big role in fomenting a lot of uncertainty surrounding Sandy Hook.
[00:58:46.839 --> 00:58:52.263]  So I'm saying that what I'm telling you right now, there's evidence that supports what Alex is saying.
[00:58:52.523 --> 00:58:59.402]   that he and many others were targeted with a Psy-op so that people would pick up and run with stories
[00:58:59.402 --> 00:59:02.762]   that later that would get them essentially caught up so to speak
[00:59:02.762 --> 00:59:10.492]   because Ice Cube for example even retweeted the Derek Chauvin piece that Jonathan Lee Riches put out and it was
[00:59:10.492 --> 00:59:14.843]   attributed to causing the riots in the George Floyd race riots.
[00:59:14.843 --> 00:59:19.562]   Thanks for that Milly. Psy-op in deep state is fun in social media but it is not a different.
[00:59:20.404 --> 00:59:21.265]  I am going to come to you guys.
[00:59:21.365 --> 00:59:26.067]  Don't worry, I am going to come to people on the other side as well to give their argument.
[00:59:26.087 --> 00:59:28.448]  Don't worry, there is going to be a balance.
[00:59:28.588 --> 00:59:30.469]  Let me just go to Dan.
[00:59:30.509 --> 00:59:32.270]  Dan, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:33.911]  Appreciate having you on.
[00:59:33.951 --> 00:59:38.893]  What's your thoughts on the fact that there is an attempt to shut down Alex Jones?
[00:59:40.616 --> 00:59:43.077]  Um, well, I haven't talked to Alex before.
[00:59:43.117 --> 00:59:44.158]  We've got mutual friends.
[00:59:44.218 --> 00:59:46.399]  I was actually coming on to hear his thoughts.
[00:59:46.439 --> 00:59:48.740]  I mean, I've heard a lot of the Sandy Hook stuff.
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:53.463]  I actually tweeted something about how ridiculous it was that, you know, they find him so much.
[00:59:53.503 --> 00:59:58.265]  But I was kind of more curious as to what he thinks, you know, actually was the cause of this.
[00:59:58.425 --> 01:00:01.227]  Because I'm pretty ignorant on the Sandy Hook thing, to be totally honest.
[01:00:03.488 --> 01:00:06.449]  Alex, that was a question to you from Dan Bilzerian.
[01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:07.590]  Are you there, Alex?
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:12.781]  I mean, yeah, I have a question for Alex when he's back.
[01:00:12.621 --> 01:00:19.621]   left hand side. Alright, Alex maybe can't hear us, he's just moving, shifting. Chase,
[01:00:19.621 --> 01:00:24.980]   if you could find out where Alex is. In the meantime, let me go to Grant. Grant, I think
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:28.539]  you were speaking before I went to Dan. Go ahead, Grant.
[01:00:28.539 --> 01:00:31.381]  I mean, yeah, I have a question for Alex when he's back.
[01:00:31.381 --> 01:00:36.221]   And it's a pretty serious question about the judgment, why they were sued, some of the things
[01:00:36.221 --> 01:00:37.181]  he published.
[01:00:37.645 --> 01:00:42.407]  And I'll make it discreet and specific, but you know, let's wait for him to come back.
[01:00:42.467 --> 01:00:43.167]  Yeah.
[01:00:43.207 --> 01:00:48.428]  In the meantime, before he comes back, like what's your, so what's your, okay.
[01:00:48.448 --> 01:00:55.971]  So I understand your position in terms of like Sandy Hook and why the, um, why the judgment should be so high.
[01:00:56.251 --> 01:00:57.831]  I guess my question to you is twofold.
[01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:00.272]  A, why is the judgment so high?
[01:01:00.372 --> 01:01:09.085]   And B, do you think that this is, uh, Do you think this is a... What do you call it?
[01:01:09.105 --> 01:01:11.247]  Do you think this is a targeted attack on him?
[01:01:11.267 --> 01:01:14.209]  Because when we hear the numbers, they are quite huge.
[01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:16.510]  They are.
[01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:17.311]  What's your thoughts on that?
[01:01:18.011 --> 01:01:26.677]  Well, the court assessed what's called punitive damages, which is also called exemplary damages, right?
[01:01:26.957 --> 01:01:33.141]  And the purpose of punitive damages and exemplary damages, they're kind of like two sides of the same coin.
[01:01:34.019 --> 01:01:39.019]  is to deter the conduct that's being punished, right?
[01:01:39.019 --> 01:01:42.819]  And it's actually to mete out a punishment.
[01:01:42.819 --> 01:01:44.739]  So that's the whole point of the court process.
[01:01:44.739 --> 01:01:49.739]   So second question, like I remember watching the trial many years ago,
[01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:54.538]   and I mean, again, I don't know if you had this perspective, but I felt like the judge,
[01:01:54.538 --> 01:01:58.858]   like maybe in America it's different, like judges are like very flamboyant
[01:01:58.858 --> 01:02:00.979]  or very opinionated or whatever.
[01:02:00.965 --> 01:02:02.827]  But in the UK, we don't have that.
[01:02:02.867 --> 01:02:05.209]  Like a judge is just right down the middle.
[01:02:05.329 --> 01:02:06.210]  They don't show opinion.
[01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:07.271]  They don't show emotion.
[01:02:07.611 --> 01:02:09.453]  You don't even know whose side they're going to be on.
[01:02:09.693 --> 01:02:24.107]   When I was watching the trial and I was seeing like the judge literally attacking him, I know he made comments about the judge, but in the UK, Once the verdict is reached, the judge is no longer required to... No, during the trial, so before the verdict was revealed.
[01:02:24.367 --> 01:02:26.589]  The trial was not held on liability.
[01:02:27.262 --> 01:02:29.124]  It was only held on damages.
[01:02:29.444 --> 01:02:31.485]  That's a different kind of trial than you're used to.
[01:02:31.525 --> 01:02:33.147]  Let me just fully ask my question, right?
[01:02:33.467 --> 01:02:52.182]  So, before the judgment was made, I was shocked, and maybe it's a UK thing, maybe US, you guys have judges who are literally, like, very opinionated, but I was shocked that, like, I knew what the judgment was, like, in the UK, I never had that, but I knew what the judgment was going to be, obviously based on the actions and the way the judge was communicating with Alex Jones' team.
[01:02:52.382 --> 01:02:55.204]  Let me just pop in, let me pop in, let me pop in quickly.
[01:02:55.771 --> 01:03:01.115]  I don't know why, because I've got full Wi-Fi, full five bars, it keeps hanging up, but I was able to dial back in here.
[01:03:01.135 --> 01:03:02.716]  Listen, I'm going to explain it again.
[01:03:03.377 --> 01:03:04.537]  Kill me if I'm wrong, folks.
[01:03:05.078 --> 01:03:08.560]  The judges in Texas and Connecticut coordinated with HBO.
[01:03:09.121 --> 01:03:11.122]  It was a full TV production with scripts.
[01:03:11.923 --> 01:03:18.688]  They put out a show called Alex Jones vs. The Truth, and they literally... No, US judges don't act like that.
[01:03:19.372 --> 01:03:20.473]  Just like UK judges don't.
[01:03:20.813 --> 01:03:27.016]  They acted completely impartial, and totally attacked me, and found me guilty beforehand.
[01:03:27.076 --> 01:03:27.716]  That's the key.
[01:03:27.756 --> 01:03:35.740]  Whether I'm the worst guy ever, they are setting the precedent to take people's due process, and that is the point your listeners are making.
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:36.940]  That is the point that happens.
[01:03:39.662 --> 01:03:41.503]  Look, I'd like to ask you a question, Alex.
[01:03:41.563 --> 01:03:41.843]  Go ahead.
[01:03:41.883 --> 01:03:43.363]  Because I've got you here.
[01:03:43.984 --> 01:03:47.245]  And the question is about intentional infliction of emotional distress.
[01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:51.130]  Which both courts found you liable for, right?
[01:03:52.171 --> 01:03:54.253]  I'm looking at some of the videos that you posted.
[01:03:55.353 --> 01:03:56.434]  Here's one from 2018.
[01:03:57.315 --> 01:04:00.898]  The title was, Sandy Hook Vampires Exposed.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.264]  Here's one, The Ultimate Sandy Hook Debate as the Second Anniversary Looms.
[01:04:09.786 --> 01:04:11.887]  Sandy Hook, the lies keep growing.
[01:04:12.288 --> 01:04:15.851]  Alex Jones responds to Sandy Hook anti-free speech lawsuit.
[01:04:17.952 --> 01:04:22.255]  Creepy Illuminati message in Batman movie hints at Sandy Hook's school.
[01:04:22.435 --> 01:04:27.218]  And these are all videos that you published that had hundreds of thousands of views.
[01:04:28.098 --> 01:04:32.721]  Did at any point you not consider that you might be wrong there?
[01:04:33.282 --> 01:04:44.529]  And how do you feel about actually knowing that you inflicted severe emotional distress on the people that filed these lawsuits and the court agreed with them and found you liable for that?
[01:04:46.823 --> 01:04:52.016]  Well, what they did was raise massive amounts of money in PR firms.
[01:04:52.056 --> 01:04:52.938]  I'm asking about you.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:54.680]  No, no, you're not letting me.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:55.661]  No, you asked the question.
[01:04:55.701 --> 01:04:56.261]  You want the answer?
[01:04:56.281 --> 01:04:58.002]  You've asked the question, let him answer.
[01:04:58.402 --> 01:04:58.802]  Thank you.
[01:04:58.842 --> 01:05:02.564]  Then people are saying, like, you know, I'm being biased or whatever, but I'm trying to make it balanced.
[01:05:03.004 --> 01:05:04.025]  Yeah, you sit there.
[01:05:04.045 --> 01:05:09.687]  But I can't have it where literally you ask him a question which he needs to give a detailed answer and then people interrupt him and not let him answer.
[01:05:09.727 --> 01:05:11.028]  Like, that's bang out of order, right?
[01:05:11.328 --> 01:05:13.509]  Like, you're asking very tough, hard questions.
[01:05:15.009 --> 01:05:18.631]  He's being pretty cool that he's here answering those questions, so you need to let him answer, right?
[01:05:18.651 --> 01:05:20.272]  So you've asked the question and nobody interrupted him.
[01:05:20.312 --> 01:05:20.732]  Go ahead, Alex.
[01:05:23.308 --> 01:05:27.672]  So, those videos, I'm very proud of.
[01:05:28.813 --> 01:05:42.964]  If you go watch that, Sandy Hook Vampires, I talk about the lawyers manipulating the families and raising money off of their name and my name, and I say in that video, I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[01:05:43.785 --> 01:05:51.211]  So you're taking headlines and you're manipulating what you think people believe off of the headlines.
[01:05:51.846 --> 01:05:58.228]  By 2016, I was saying I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[01:05:59.089 --> 01:06:01.689]  So you're taking videos where I go, Sandy Hook vampires.
[01:06:01.769 --> 01:06:03.630]  I mean people feeding off Sandy Hook.
[01:06:04.170 --> 01:06:04.971]  People living off it.
[01:06:05.031 --> 01:06:06.191]  I don't want to ever talk about it again.
[01:06:07.731 --> 01:06:10.393]  The families have said to their lawyers, we never talk about it again.
[01:06:10.473 --> 01:06:16.859]  Great, they have HBO specials, they're raising money on my name, they use my face everywhere to say I'm attacking them to raise money.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:21.184]  I've actually told them, stop talking about me, I'll stop talking about you.
[01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:28.771]  Again, we're not talking about WMDs in Iraq, we're not talking about nuclear war in Russia, we're not talking about the fake shots, we're talking about Alex Jones' fake news.
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:37.028]  Which is a diversion from all the admitted controlled fake news put up by the Pentagon and the CIA against America and the world.
[01:06:37.048 --> 01:06:38.130]  And that's what this is about.
[01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:39.691]  He put all about Alex Jones.
[01:06:39.851 --> 01:06:40.512]  All about him.
[01:06:40.893 --> 01:06:42.394]  All about how he was mean to these families.
[01:06:42.775 --> 01:06:44.036]  All about how he put them through distress.
[01:06:44.457 --> 01:06:48.421]  And then they put on evidence with no evidence that I peed on graves.
[01:06:50.313 --> 01:07:06.308]  Alex, that was the letter that one of the Sandy Hook parents received stating that a man peed on their grave, their child's grave, because they didn't believe that they were dead.
[01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:08.450]  Nobody said that it was you.
[01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:10.312]  Somebody said it was one of your many followers.
[01:07:10.352 --> 01:07:12.034]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.421]  After I was found guilty without a trial.
[01:07:15.441 --> 01:07:18.023]  You were found liable, not guilty.
[01:07:18.083 --> 01:07:18.943]  Let's get that right.
[01:07:19.023 --> 01:07:19.643]  No, I wasn't.
[01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:20.584]  No, no, no.
[01:07:20.624 --> 01:07:21.184]  You look it up.
[01:07:21.545 --> 01:07:26.287]  The judges found me guilty of defamation without a jury trial.
[01:07:26.528 --> 01:07:35.993]  You're so upset because it goes against jurisprudence and English common law, just like with the Trump campaign where he supposedly raped a woman with no evidence 30 years ago.
[01:07:36.013 --> 01:07:38.054]  You're liable, Alex, not guilty.
[01:07:38.114 --> 01:07:38.575]  No, no.
[01:07:38.615 --> 01:07:40.656]  They said I was... That means guilty.
[01:07:41.761 --> 01:07:44.523]  It's in the court ruling in Texas and Connecticut.
[01:07:44.843 --> 01:07:47.225]  The judges found me guilty.
[01:07:47.725 --> 01:07:54.670]  It says it in the court ruling and you can't deal with that because you know that exposes the fraud of the whole thing.
[01:07:55.050 --> 01:07:57.832]  I was found guilty by a judge, not a jury.
[01:07:57.992 --> 01:07:59.373]  I was found guilty.
[01:07:59.413 --> 01:08:01.474]  Just let him finish his point.
[01:08:01.574 --> 01:08:04.616]  One second guys, like literally let him, you can disagree with him.
[01:08:04.716 --> 01:08:07.078]  Once he finishes his point, you can debate him and have your position.
[01:08:07.118 --> 01:08:08.799]  Like literally three people have interrupted him now.
[01:08:09.479 --> 01:08:10.440]  Let him finish his point.
[01:08:11.238 --> 01:08:15.441]  Yeah, I'm here.
[01:08:15.502 --> 01:08:18.684]  I gave them, I offered them $55 million to just leave me alone and they said no.
[01:08:18.503 --> 01:08:26.503]   I'm here. I gave them, I offered them 55 million to just leave me alone and they
[01:08:26.503 --> 01:08:30.064]  said no. We're gonna continue to say you're attacking us.
[01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:35.253]   We're gonna continue to say you're after us. And on the news now, Alex Jones is
[01:08:35.253 --> 01:08:37.144]  attacking us.
[01:08:35.264 --> 01:08:36.325]  Alex Jones is after us.
[01:08:36.405 --> 01:08:37.726]  Oh, here's all our fundraisers.
[01:08:37.786 --> 01:08:38.326]  Oh, we're victims.
[01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:41.109]  It keeps Sandy Hook in the news.
[01:08:41.569 --> 01:08:49.555]  And no one knows the name, almost no one, of Adam Lanza, the guy whose mother bought him the AR-15.
[01:08:50.516 --> 01:08:53.479]  Adam Lanza, who was an intern at the CIA, on record.
[01:08:54.219 --> 01:08:56.441]  No one talks about whose house they bulldozed.
[01:08:56.989 --> 01:08:59.190]  No one talks about Adam Lanza.
[01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:00.990]  It's all Alex Jones.
[01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:07.552]  I've had people in parking lots and at stores come up at least 10 times and say, F you, you killed those kids.
[01:09:07.632 --> 01:09:09.533]  They believe I killed those kids.
[01:09:10.253 --> 01:09:12.194]  And I didn't kill those kids.
[01:09:12.894 --> 01:09:18.395]  So this is all a giant distraction to demonize populism and to demonize questioning the next big narrative.
[01:09:18.956 --> 01:09:23.637]  So, I mean, I'm happy to talk to these folks all day long and debate them all day long.
[01:09:24.235 --> 01:09:26.276]  But at the end of the day, man, I had my First Amendment.
[01:09:26.756 --> 01:09:27.976]  What I said was misrepresented.
[01:09:28.237 --> 01:09:31.218]  But if I said the things they claimed, I have a right to do it.
[01:09:31.258 --> 01:09:33.458]  But I didn't do the things they said.
[01:09:33.498 --> 01:09:39.681]  If people just subscribe at RealAlexJones on X, they will hear daily what the establishment is so scared of.
[01:09:39.701 --> 01:09:41.561]  Look, Alex, can you give me your final answer?
[01:09:41.581 --> 01:09:43.702]  Do you feel any remorse towards your victims?
[01:09:45.043 --> 01:09:45.443]  Yes or no?
[01:09:46.938 --> 01:09:49.380]  Do you feel any remorse for the victims of WMDs?
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:50.700]  Yes or no, Alex.
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.301]  I didn't do anything with WMDs.
[01:09:52.341 --> 01:09:52.902]  No, I'm asking a question.
[01:09:52.982 --> 01:09:58.565]  I've already said I'd give them $55 million if you go back to this and you use this to attack populism.
[01:09:58.605 --> 01:09:59.765]  I'm asking if you feel remorse.
[01:09:59.785 --> 01:10:00.586]  I'm not attacking anybody.
[01:10:00.606 --> 01:10:01.586]  I'm asking you a question.
[01:10:01.606 --> 01:10:03.888]  You don't care about the 60-plus million aborted babies?
[01:10:04.528 --> 01:10:06.449]  You don't care about the 200,000 dead from fentanyl?
[01:10:06.489 --> 01:10:08.210]  I'm not asking you about those things.
[01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:08.931]  Do you feel remorse?
[01:10:08.951 --> 01:10:10.551]  No, I'm not going to respond to your loaded question.
[01:10:10.572 --> 01:10:10.852]  Yes or no.
[01:10:10.932 --> 01:10:11.552]  I'm done.
[01:10:11.892 --> 01:10:12.252]  I'm done.
[01:10:12.272 --> 01:10:13.153]  I've already answered this question.
[01:10:13.233 --> 01:10:14.094]  Okay, that's your question.
[01:10:15.236 --> 01:10:17.617]  Let's go to... I thought you were going to ask, like... Alex!
[01:10:18.038 --> 01:10:19.378]  Can I ask you a question?
[01:10:19.519 --> 01:10:19.979]  One second.
[01:10:20.019 --> 01:10:20.799]  Let's go to Dan.
[01:10:20.979 --> 01:10:21.400]  Go ahead, Dan.
[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:27.463]  I was just curious what you think happened during Sandy Hook, because I'm a little ignorant of the situation.
[01:10:27.503 --> 01:10:30.645]  So, what is the hypothesis of what went down?
[01:10:33.547 --> 01:10:34.968]  Like, who was behind it?
[01:10:35.628 --> 01:10:37.249]  He's asking what you really think happened, Alex.
[01:10:40.802 --> 01:10:42.383]  Alex having a lot of technical issues dropped.
[01:10:42.403 --> 01:10:46.346]  He'll come back, Dan, and we will get him to come and answer the questions.
[01:10:46.486 --> 01:10:48.508]  I couldn't hear the last speaker either.
[01:10:48.528 --> 01:10:50.389]  It might not have just been Alex.
[01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:58.055]  Chase, do you want to rephrase Dan's question and ask Alex?
[01:10:59.056 --> 01:10:59.496]  Sure.
[01:10:59.776 --> 01:11:04.080]  My understanding is that Dan asked Alex what he thinks really happened as of now.
[01:11:07.027 --> 01:11:07.668]  I cut out again.
[01:11:07.688 --> 01:11:08.409]  This never happens.
[01:11:08.429 --> 01:11:09.429]  It's happening all the time now.
[01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:11.111]  Some glitch, I guess.
[01:11:11.151 --> 01:11:14.313]  I'm sitting here with like full wireless, full four bars.
[01:11:14.333 --> 01:11:15.094]  I don't know what's happening.
[01:11:17.516 --> 01:11:20.238]  Sandy Hook is a very small part of what I've done in 30 years.
[01:11:21.099 --> 01:11:26.824]  I covered people questioning it, and so I don't mind coming on shows to talk about it, but it's not really where I'm at.
[01:11:27.204 --> 01:11:39.465]   The best thinking I've got is from the police reports, which no one wants to talk about, The first police show up, they go in, the bathroom door won't open, they push it open, and there's a pile of dead bodies and a pyramid of children.
[01:11:40.425 --> 01:11:42.867]  And the police go, there's no blood, we believe they're moved here.
[01:11:43.527 --> 01:11:46.009]  That is in the police report.
[01:11:46.729 --> 01:12:05.309]   So I believe they had disinfo operatives come in and say it didn't happen, to create a big national debate, which they would put all over the news, they pushed the links, they questioned it, because their false flag was being exposed, they killed real kids there, And then they brought it into this thing that didn't happen as a diversion.
[01:12:05.609 --> 01:12:08.772]  That's a conspiracy theory, that's speculation.
[01:12:09.092 --> 01:12:16.439]  99% of what I do is on record, hey, Biden doesn't know where he's at, or inflation's high, or we have this many illegal aliens come across.
[01:12:16.639 --> 01:12:17.760]  I just cover real stuff.
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:22.824]  And the few times I would speculate, oh, maybe they're right, maybe they're wrong, becomes who I am.
[01:12:22.924 --> 01:12:25.907]  So bottom line, I believe real kids were killed there.
[01:12:26.468 --> 01:12:29.449]  They caught men in the woods in camo and all the rest of the stuff that's on record.
[01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:30.790]  They don't want it debated.
[01:12:30.810 --> 01:12:35.052]  I believe real children died, and they don't want us to investigate what really happened there.
[01:12:36.333 --> 01:12:38.154]  And do you think the purpose was to ban guns?
[01:12:38.234 --> 01:12:40.695]  What do you think the reason would be behind that?
[01:12:41.295 --> 01:12:44.136]  Yeah, I mean, it was Obama that were trying to ban the guns then.
[01:12:44.156 --> 01:12:46.077]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:12:46.097 --> 01:12:47.258]  The police reports are real.
[01:12:47.578 --> 01:12:48.619]  The EMT reports are real.
[01:12:48.659 --> 01:12:49.459]  People go look them up.
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:55.762]  They get there, and they go in the bathroom, and there's all the dead kids in a pyramid, like a ritual.
[01:12:56.354 --> 01:12:57.414]  And there's no blood.
[01:12:57.475 --> 01:13:00.376]  The cops say in the police report, we believe the body's removed here.
[01:13:01.856 --> 01:13:04.057]  But notice the media won't cover this.
[01:13:04.237 --> 01:13:07.159]  I've been saying this since the police report came out a year later.
[01:13:07.739 --> 01:13:16.503]  So I was all over other shooters, other people, and then these professors, all these people came forward, and they put up a compelling case that they learned was fake.
[01:13:16.963 --> 01:13:19.684]  And I started debating them, saying, no, I think kids died.
[01:13:20.284 --> 01:13:22.405]  And that's when they went, oh, Alex Jones!
[01:13:22.505 --> 01:13:24.166]  And then that's when the CIA came after me.
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:26.621]  So I figured it all out in hindsight.
[01:13:27.301 --> 01:13:30.183]  Alex, can I ask you a factual clarification question?
[01:13:30.643 --> 01:13:54.135]  So in one of the reports on the latest developments, there is an assertion, this is in the New York Times, that you are currently routing purchases of your diet supplements through your father's company, and the Connecticut lawyers are claiming that that's proof that you don't intend to pay your fine because you're, you know, moving around money.
[01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:56.711]  So if you could just address that, if that's true.
[01:13:56.751 --> 01:14:01.475]  And then secondly, slightly different topic, but you mentioned before that you were in Detroit last weekend.
[01:14:01.515 --> 01:14:03.776]  Answer that question because I can't bombard with a question.
[01:14:03.816 --> 01:14:04.217]  Go ahead, Alex.
[01:14:06.118 --> 01:14:09.120]  Yeah, it's like asking if Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer has a red nose.
[01:14:10.201 --> 01:14:15.164]  My dad is a doctor and he helped create Dr. Jones Naturals.
[01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:19.507]  He helped create InfoWars supplements, InfoWars Life.
[01:14:20.188 --> 01:14:28.981]   And so for a decade, He has advertised with us and for a decade he has promoted other websites and stuff.
[01:14:29.001 --> 01:14:38.507]  So he is an official sponsor under the bankruptcy for a supplement company he has, and I'm glad my dad's making money, but he pays that into the company.
[01:14:39.387 --> 01:14:40.928]  The judge totally shot that down.
[01:14:41.789 --> 01:14:42.809]  There's contracts.
[01:14:42.949 --> 01:14:43.410]  It's there.
[01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:47.172]  My dad's worked at InfoWars for 13 years.
[01:14:47.872 --> 01:14:48.713]  Notice the judge.
[01:14:49.406 --> 01:14:50.407]  Didn't respond to that.
[01:14:50.507 --> 01:14:51.907]  The judge, he already knew all that.
[01:14:52.288 --> 01:14:53.328]  The judge has done his homework.
[01:14:53.749 --> 01:14:56.690]  So hell yeah, my dad's been involved for 13 years with my company.
[01:14:57.070 --> 01:15:05.575]  He has drjonesnationals.com, which has amazing colonel silver products, nano silver products, just amazing supplements, drjonesnationals.com.
[01:15:06.236 --> 01:15:09.978]  And he's a great sponsor of InfoWars and free speech systems.
[01:15:10.058 --> 01:15:13.460]  And again, it's like acting like the sun comes up and you're hiding it.
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:20.128]   This is a long term sponsor And it's all on record with the court.
[01:15:20.128 --> 01:15:24.628]   Just like they said, we had guns at the office and all this to shut us down.
[01:15:24.628 --> 01:15:26.467]  So it's just, it's completely insane.
[01:15:26.467 --> 01:15:28.288]  It's completely crazy.
[01:15:28.288 --> 01:15:30.448]  And finally, you know, we've got to judge this in buying.
[01:15:30.448 --> 01:15:32.128]  Does that answer your question?
[01:15:32.128 --> 01:15:33.128]  Yeah.
[01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:37.448]   And just secondly, you mentioned before that you were asking...
[01:15:37.448 --> 01:15:38.448]  What I'm...
[01:15:38.767 --> 01:15:39.508]  Just a very quick follow-up.
[01:15:39.548 --> 01:15:39.648]  No, no.
[01:15:39.668 --> 01:15:40.468]  You've asked one question.
[01:15:40.528 --> 01:15:41.268]  I need to go to somebody else.
[01:15:41.328 --> 01:15:41.948]  I'll come back to you.
[01:15:42.028 --> 01:15:44.609]  Like, I can't... This always happens when you want to ask, like, ten questions.
[01:15:44.689 --> 01:15:46.969]  I'm not being rude, but... No, I want to ask two, not ten.
[01:15:47.389 --> 01:15:50.250]  No, but it normally happens that you'll ask two, and then you'll ask another follow-up.
[01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:51.930]  No, I was just going to ask one follow-up.
[01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:52.951]  Michael, I'll come back to you.
[01:15:53.051 --> 01:15:53.891]  I'm going to go to Lucky.
[01:15:53.971 --> 01:15:54.671]  Lucky, jump in.
[01:15:54.691 --> 01:15:57.031]  Let's hear another info war, so he'll look familiar or something.
[01:15:57.352 --> 01:15:58.892]  Michael, what are you talking nonsense?
[01:15:59.052 --> 01:16:01.412]  I literally went to Grant.
[01:16:01.713 --> 01:16:03.613]  He was someone who was attacking Alex.
[01:16:04.513 --> 01:16:05.314]  Then I went to you.
[01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:06.554]  You were someone who was attacking Alex.
[01:16:06.574 --> 01:16:07.515]  That's two attackers.
[01:16:07.535 --> 01:16:08.255]  I didn't attack Alex.
[01:16:08.275 --> 01:16:09.696]  I asked for a point of clarification.
[01:16:10.716 --> 01:16:11.336]  Keep quiet.
[01:16:11.356 --> 01:16:12.697]  If you're going to mourn, you may as well leave.
[01:16:12.757 --> 01:16:14.137]  I'm literally saying I went to two attackers.
[01:16:14.177 --> 01:16:15.178]  Now I'm balancing it out.
[01:16:15.458 --> 01:16:16.158]  I'm going to someone.
[01:16:16.178 --> 01:16:17.899]  And by the way, Lookie's not part of Infowars.
[01:16:18.179 --> 01:16:22.281]  But maybe you can't digest the idea that maybe someone might have an alternative opinion.
[01:16:22.921 --> 01:16:23.421]  Ridiculous.
[01:16:24.062 --> 01:16:24.662]  And I didn't drop him.
[01:16:24.682 --> 01:16:25.202]  He just ran off.
[01:16:25.462 --> 01:16:25.943]  Go ahead, Lookie.
[01:16:26.023 --> 01:16:27.023]  Really quick, though.
[01:16:27.363 --> 01:16:29.444]  Look up in the nest, guys.
[01:16:29.524 --> 01:16:29.864]  One second.
[01:16:29.884 --> 01:16:30.144]  Millie.
[01:16:30.665 --> 01:16:31.705]  We're going to... Evidence.
[01:16:31.965 --> 01:16:32.445]  Receipts.
[01:16:32.606 --> 01:16:32.966]  There you go.
[01:16:32.986 --> 01:16:33.186]  Millie.
[01:16:33.346 --> 01:16:33.586]  Millie.
[01:16:34.209 --> 01:16:35.089]  We're going to go to Lucky.
[01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:36.590]  When it comes to your time, we'll go to you.
[01:16:36.610 --> 01:16:37.070]  Go ahead, Lucky.
[01:16:37.991 --> 01:16:39.251]  Hey, thanks, Oleg, for having me.
[01:16:39.271 --> 01:16:40.392]  Thanks, Marion and Sarah.
[01:16:40.832 --> 01:16:45.374]  I think the issue, right, is that Alex is being held liable for actions of other people.
[01:16:45.515 --> 01:16:50.197]  I think Sarah said, well, someone went and peed on, you know, a grave or someone did this or went inside a house.
[01:16:50.677 --> 01:16:51.658]  Well, Alex Jones didn't do that.
[01:16:51.858 --> 01:16:53.258]  Alex Jones didn't tell these people to do that.
[01:16:53.739 --> 01:16:54.459]  He just reported.
[01:16:54.799 --> 01:16:56.480]  Sorry, of course, I'm making noise.
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:00.682]  He just reported, right, what happened, what he thought happened at the time.
[01:17:01.235 --> 01:17:08.879]  And if you look at intentional motion, intentional affliction of emotional distress, which that one speaker was talking about, that's rarely if ever found.
[01:17:09.319 --> 01:17:12.140]  And I don't think it's ever really been found on a purely speech issue.
[01:17:13.281 --> 01:17:21.725]  The famous case there that the Supreme Court heard was Phelps, Snyder v. Phelps, where the Westboro Baptist Church would actually go and picket soldiers' funerals.
[01:17:21.885 --> 01:17:29.129]  And, you know, with these very incendiary signs and kind of just kind of blame the soldier's death on their, you know, on the family and stuff.
[01:17:29.548 --> 01:17:33.109]  So the family sued, they wanted a lower court, you know, went all the way up to the Supreme Court.
[01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:39.391]  They basically said, listen, free speech trumps even the worst type of speech, even people who would go and pick at soldiers' funerals.
[01:17:39.771 --> 01:17:47.494]  And I mean, the Westboro Baptist Church was also posting very incendiary stuff about the family, post-fact, and they still said, you know, this isn't, free speech trumps all of us, right?
[01:17:47.894 --> 01:17:56.217]  As long as it's a matter of public concern, which talking about Sandy Hook, which was being used to limit Second Amendment rights, um, kind of goes to that.
[01:17:56.744 --> 01:18:02.270]  So that's what kind of the court that heard Alex's case should have probably filed that George Prudence and they did it.
[01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:07.375]  And secondly, with all this, um, you know, stand-up stuff, they're doing the same things with gun companies, right?
[01:18:07.395 --> 01:18:13.742]  They're trying to hold, you know, the gun companies liable for what Adam Lanza did and say that, you know, bring lawsuits that way.
[01:18:13.762 --> 01:18:19.468]  So it's just a two-pronged approach where they're going after, you know, the right of free speech and also the second minor right.
[01:18:20.286 --> 01:18:21.787]  Well, I mean, he's absolutely right.
[01:18:21.807 --> 01:18:23.388]  The Westboro Baptist Church are horrible people.
[01:18:23.428 --> 01:18:28.130]  They go scream at dead troops' families and say, your son deserved to die because America's a godless whatever.
[01:18:27.949 --> 01:18:28.949]  Thanks for having me.
[01:18:28.949 --> 01:18:29.949]  Thanks a lot, Lucky.
[01:18:29.949 --> 01:18:32.949]  Alex, do you want to add to anything Lucky said?
[01:18:32.949 --> 01:18:36.788]  Well, I mean, he's absolutely right.
[01:18:36.788 --> 01:18:39.628]  The Westboro Baptist Church are horrible people.
[01:18:39.628 --> 01:18:44.349]   They go scream at dead troops' families and say your son deserves to die because America
[01:18:44.349 --> 01:18:45.349]  is a godless whatever.
[01:18:45.349 --> 01:18:52.029]   I'd hate those people, but they have a right to do that because if we don't stand up for
[01:18:52.029 --> 01:18:54.668]  their rights, we lose everybody's rights.
[01:18:54.700 --> 01:19:02.563]  And that's what's happened with me is the press is being set to take everybody's rights away using me.
[01:19:02.863 --> 01:19:04.024]  And that's what's been done.
[01:19:04.064 --> 01:19:07.785]  And meanwhile, I didn't even do the things they said I did.
[01:19:08.365 --> 01:19:15.028]  And they admit, after they won these fake court judgments, it was a beta test to shut down everybody else.
[01:19:15.068 --> 01:19:17.109]  They bragged, they set on the courthouse steps.
[01:19:18.163 --> 01:19:18.923]  We don't want money.
[01:19:19.724 --> 01:19:21.144]  We want to silence Alex Jones.
[01:19:22.044 --> 01:19:27.586]  And so then, when they refuse the money, they run around and say, he won't give us our money.
[01:19:28.287 --> 01:19:31.208]  So this is all about them trying to shut me down.
[01:19:31.248 --> 01:19:33.428]  But the good news is, it's backfired.
[01:19:34.309 --> 01:19:37.790]  And people see through it, and they realize this is about power and control.
[01:19:37.810 --> 01:19:44.132]  So it doesn't matter how many Krasnistins they've got out there pushing their narrative, America and the world is awake.
[01:19:44.172 --> 01:19:46.393]  But that commenter's dead on.
[01:19:48.634 --> 01:19:52.255]  Okay, so, Dr. Michael, I'm going to come to you after Brian, because you did 100.
[01:19:52.375 --> 01:19:55.956]  I think you're going to be more towards Alex, and I want to get somebody on the other side.
[01:19:56.676 --> 01:19:58.717]  So, Krasinski, your name was mentioned, so I'll go to you.
[01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:02.778]  Brian?
[01:20:04.778 --> 01:20:06.338]  Brian, can you hear Sully?
[01:20:07.419 --> 01:20:08.679]  Lord Krasinski.
[01:20:10.159 --> 01:20:11.680]  No, I couldn't hear Sully there.
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:12.840]  Your name was mentioned.
[01:20:15.879 --> 01:20:18.501]  Brian, your name was mentioned by the previous speaker.
[01:20:18.521 --> 01:20:24.086]  No, I just said, no matter what he does trying to distract off this, this is an attack on free speech.
[01:20:27.388 --> 01:20:30.250]  So, I didn't hear exactly what the other speaker said.
[01:20:30.291 --> 01:20:31.031]  Is there a question?
[01:20:31.752 --> 01:20:34.234]  No, I just said, you're anti-free speech.
[01:20:34.874 --> 01:20:37.036]  Because even if I did the things... No, I'm not.
[01:20:37.955 --> 01:20:40.478]  No, so I believe in free speech.
[01:20:40.498 --> 01:20:41.799]  I think free speech is important.
[01:20:42.219 --> 01:20:44.662]  But there's different levels of free speech.
[01:20:44.702 --> 01:20:47.385]  There's free speech as afforded by the U.S.
[01:20:47.405 --> 01:20:47.865]  Constitution.
[01:20:47.905 --> 01:20:50.668]  Different levels?
[01:20:50.808 --> 01:20:51.389]  Well, there is.
[01:20:51.789 --> 01:20:55.913]  I mean, the Constitution isn't speaking about your freedom of speech on a social media platform.
[01:20:55.953 --> 01:20:56.334]  No, you're right.
[01:20:56.394 --> 01:21:00.238]  Lying about WMB is okay, but if Alex Jones covers people questioning a shooting, he's got to be shut down.
[01:21:02.114 --> 01:21:02.374]  Why?
[01:21:02.515 --> 01:21:04.276]  What does this have to do with WMD?
[01:21:04.296 --> 01:21:05.998]  Why do you keep bringing WMD up?
[01:21:06.038 --> 01:21:07.059]  Like nobody's hearing about WMD.
[01:21:07.079 --> 01:21:09.881]  Because that live killed millions of people and I didn't kill anybody.
[01:21:09.901 --> 01:21:11.783]  No, because you wanted to distract.
[01:21:11.843 --> 01:21:12.964]  No, we're not distracting.
[01:21:13.124 --> 01:21:14.826]  We're distracting from the real crimes.
[01:21:15.326 --> 01:21:17.027]  Why aren't we covering the real crimes?
[01:21:18.749 --> 01:21:22.592]  I wasn't even talking for the last 35 minutes, so I don't even know what you're talking about here.
[01:21:22.612 --> 01:21:27.558]   No, I just mentioned you because you wanted to distract off I think all those things are important.
[01:21:27.378 --> 01:21:32.097]   the surveillance, the control, and then act like I'm the bad guy.
[01:21:32.097 --> 01:21:34.778]  Listen, you guys have failed this impetus.
[01:21:34.778 --> 01:21:37.178]  I think all those things are important.
[01:21:37.178 --> 01:21:38.657]  I think those things are important.
[01:21:38.657 --> 01:21:42.977]   I think that your views towards them differ from mine, but I think they're very important.
[01:21:43.333 --> 01:21:48.997]  But I don't think anybody came here, the title of this room is Alex Jones Live, InfoWars Closed.
[01:21:49.077 --> 01:21:52.300]  Nobody came here to talk about COVID or WNB or any of that.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:53.701]  But I didn't lie!
[01:21:54.122 --> 01:21:55.022]  I didn't lie!
[01:21:55.142 --> 01:22:00.667]  I covered a major movement of America's questioning things because they've been lied to so much.
[01:22:01.087 --> 01:22:02.388]  People have been lied to so much.
[01:22:02.448 --> 01:22:06.632]  How many times are we going to be lied to until we don't believe Jesse Smollett got attacked?
[01:22:08.208 --> 01:22:10.229]  But we're not here to talk about Jesse Smollett.
[01:22:10.249 --> 01:22:12.131]  You did lie, according to the court.
[01:22:12.191 --> 01:22:13.952]  Oh, according to the rigged court.
[01:22:14.452 --> 01:22:15.232]  Listen to me.
[01:22:16.133 --> 01:22:18.054]  I questioned the official story.
[01:22:18.354 --> 01:22:19.775]  You keep saying I'm a liar.
[01:22:20.096 --> 01:22:20.836]  That's not true.
[01:22:21.416 --> 01:22:24.478]  No, I said you lied, whether that means you're a liar or not.
[01:22:24.518 --> 01:22:25.199]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:22:25.279 --> 01:22:27.680]  But that's what the court determined.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.642]  Lying means you're conscious.
[01:22:29.742 --> 01:22:32.443]  If you're mistaken, it's a mistake.
[01:22:32.503 --> 01:22:33.324]  Look at the dictionary.
[01:22:33.897 --> 01:22:35.478]  Being mistaken is one thing.
[01:22:35.598 --> 01:22:36.699]  I did not lie.
[01:22:37.039 --> 01:22:41.123]  And as soon as I said I thought Sandy Hook happened, they sued me because they said I was a liar.
[01:22:41.303 --> 01:22:42.864]  I said I was wrong.
[01:22:43.404 --> 01:22:44.385]  I made a mistake.
[01:22:44.725 --> 01:22:45.806]  And you say that was a lie.
[01:22:45.826 --> 01:22:46.867]  It was not a lie.
[01:22:47.287 --> 01:22:49.389]  It points to my life when I believe it might have been staged.
[01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:53.632]  So Brian, can you hear me?
[01:22:54.072 --> 01:22:57.375]  The court determined that you should have known the truth when you said what you said.
[01:22:57.635 --> 01:23:01.398]  Oh, two Democrat judges determined and then found me guilty?
[01:23:03.696 --> 01:23:06.899]  They would not have found you liable, not guilty, of defamation.
[01:23:06.919 --> 01:23:08.160]  No, they found me guilty.
[01:23:08.521 --> 01:23:09.662]  Liable means guilty.
[01:23:09.762 --> 01:23:10.883]  Stop lying.
[01:23:10.923 --> 01:23:17.148]  They found me guilty in the court orders.
[01:23:17.268 --> 01:23:18.910]  You cannot be guilty of defamation.
[01:23:19.230 --> 01:23:20.071]  That is impossible.
[01:23:20.111 --> 01:23:24.495]  He wasn't shown the actual evidence until the court... Brian, I'm just going to drop you and bring you back up.
[01:23:24.575 --> 01:23:25.275]  I think you can't hear me.
[01:23:25.315 --> 01:23:25.716]  Go ahead, Melissa.
[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:31.304]  Brian, I'm just, let me tell you, we're going to drop you and bring you back up because I don't think you can hear us.
[01:23:31.324 --> 01:23:32.785]  I didn't mean to bring up Krasnostin.
[01:23:32.825 --> 01:23:36.367]  He's just, he just, if we said the sky was blue, he'd say it was red.
[01:23:36.387 --> 01:23:37.388]  It doesn't matter.
[01:23:37.408 --> 01:23:38.248]  Let's go to some other people.
[01:23:38.268 --> 01:23:42.171]  The point is I'm on record as saying it did happen the first year or so.
[01:23:42.531 --> 01:23:43.352]  Then I questioned it.
[01:23:43.372 --> 01:23:44.593]  I didn't do anything they claimed.
[01:23:44.613 --> 01:23:45.874]  They raised money off of me.
[01:23:45.894 --> 01:23:47.515]  It's a giant PR operation.
[01:23:47.535 --> 01:23:49.036]  They're trying to crush everybody's free speech.
[01:23:49.416 --> 01:23:50.917]  Everybody knows that it's disgusting.
[01:23:52.098 --> 01:23:53.499]  Alex, what did the Autopsy Report show?
[01:23:55.469 --> 01:23:56.590]  If I could pose a point here.
[01:23:57.250 --> 01:24:08.878]  Interestingly, Alex Jones is being attacked, but there was a book written by James Fetzer called Nobody Died at Sandy Hook, and nothing has happened to this author and his co-authors.
[01:24:08.898 --> 01:24:14.542]  A 450-page compilation of essays about this, and nobody said a word.
[01:24:15.022 --> 01:24:16.163]  Nobody's gone after them.
[01:24:16.243 --> 01:24:26.204]   The reason Alex Jones is being attacked is because he is a public figure of incredible reach, and because They want to make an example of him.
[01:24:26.444 --> 01:24:35.466]  And I believe that these Sandy Hook parents are certainly proxies for the actors that Alex has pointed to.
[01:24:36.006 --> 01:24:38.447]  And I would like to ask one question of Alex, if I might.
[01:24:39.287 --> 01:24:42.288]  Alex, who do you think was really responsible for the shootings?
[01:24:42.308 --> 01:24:44.349]  I want to be 100% clear.
[01:24:44.589 --> 01:24:45.709]  I believe children were killed.
[01:24:45.769 --> 01:24:46.809]  I've read the police reports.
[01:24:46.869 --> 01:24:47.930]  They're real police officers.
[01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:48.750]  I checked their names.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:51.561]  The first officer responded within 16 years.
[01:24:52.241 --> 01:24:54.221]  He came in and was totally blown away.
[01:24:55.561 --> 01:25:05.624]  He forced open the bathroom door, it's in the police report, and there was a pile in a pyramid, he said placed there, of children stacked on top of each other with no blood.
[01:25:06.564 --> 01:25:08.864]  And in the police report he says, I believe they were moved there.
[01:25:09.585 --> 01:25:12.705]  Then the EMT show up, their report says the same thing.
[01:25:13.486 --> 01:25:15.546]  So no wonder whatever happened.
[01:25:16.021 --> 01:25:18.203]  They put out this info and got us all to cover it.
[01:25:18.243 --> 01:25:18.984]  And I took the bait.
[01:25:19.044 --> 01:25:19.724]  I'm smarter now.
[01:25:19.844 --> 01:25:20.065]  I'm 50.
[01:25:20.705 --> 01:25:21.626]  But I don't know what happened.
[01:25:21.806 --> 01:25:27.431]  I just know the police got there and there was a pile of dead kids in a pyramid in the bathroom with no blood.
[01:25:28.132 --> 01:25:30.554]  Alex, what did the autopsy report say?
[01:25:32.515 --> 01:25:34.217]  You know, they have sealed those.
[01:25:35.195 --> 01:25:40.677]  And redacted most of it, so it's not released, basically, from the last time I saw.
[01:25:41.097 --> 01:25:45.139]  It may be out now, but this whole thing is, the whole thing's crazy.
[01:25:45.499 --> 01:25:48.420]  And here's the thing, I don't want to talk about it, not because I was sued over it.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.640]  It happened 11 years ago.
[01:25:51.321 --> 01:25:53.641]  I got sued five years ago.
[01:25:54.202 --> 01:25:55.362]  I barely ever talked about it.
[01:25:55.402 --> 01:25:56.663]  I'm not the Sandy Hook guy.
[01:25:57.423 --> 01:26:02.304]  And now, in these court hearings, they say, will you stop talking about it?
[01:26:02.364 --> 01:26:07.487]   I'm like, you're, you have age You're all over the news.
[01:26:08.168 --> 01:26:11.770]  They run PR ads everywhere, raising money, saying I'm attacking them.
[01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:14.692]  And then they say, stop talking about us.
[01:26:14.892 --> 01:26:21.857]  How am I supposed to sit here when all they do is say, no one knows who Adam Lanza is.
[01:26:22.697 --> 01:26:27.521]  People attack me at the grocery store and say, how dare you kill those kids?
[01:26:28.702 --> 01:26:30.363]  Alex Jones equals Sandy Hook.
[01:26:30.923 --> 01:26:35.484]   That's why I told a reporter, For an HBO special, you know, a year ago, I said, fine, I killed him.
[01:26:35.904 --> 01:26:37.045]  I confess, I killed the kids.
[01:26:37.065 --> 01:26:41.168]  And I didn't know how to respond to that because it's insane!
[01:26:41.288 --> 01:26:42.389]  It's insane!
[01:26:42.409 --> 01:26:44.811]  And so that's where we are.
[01:26:44.831 --> 01:26:55.118]  The internet... I said the name of one Sandy Hook parent because they came out laughing, smiling, saw the camera, started crying.
[01:26:55.338 --> 01:26:56.559]  The internet didn't believe it.
[01:26:56.579 --> 01:26:57.960]  The internet questioned it.
[01:26:57.980 --> 01:26:59.401]  I know people like Weird Under Pressure.
[01:26:59.461 --> 01:27:00.122]  It's probably real.
[01:27:00.822 --> 01:27:03.723]  But then I get to show up in court in Connecticut and Texas on Friday.
[01:27:03.743 --> 01:27:10.466]  And when I walk off the elevator, that same man literally walks halfway into my way and bugs his eyes out of me.
[01:27:11.227 --> 01:27:14.508]  He's the one guy, I said the name of his kids, his kid.
[01:27:14.828 --> 01:27:15.829]  I didn't attack him.
[01:27:15.849 --> 01:27:17.069]  I don't even know him.
[01:27:17.089 --> 01:27:21.411]  And so I think his kid died.
[01:27:22.092 --> 01:27:26.454]  So I'm literally looking at a guy who wants to attack me and I don't even know him.
[01:27:26.514 --> 01:27:29.035]  I just saw a video on YouTube and said, yeah, it looks fake.
[01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:31.992]  So, but then I've been through grief too.
[01:27:32.072 --> 01:27:33.193]  I've laughed when I'm sad.
[01:27:33.693 --> 01:27:35.955]  And I even said that on air like five years ago before I got sued.
[01:27:35.995 --> 01:27:38.757]  I said, no, I think, you know, but they don't care.
[01:27:38.817 --> 01:27:39.597]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:27:40.718 --> 01:27:42.419]  I take my show at like 6 a.m.
[01:27:42.879 --> 01:27:47.422]  Tuesday live, but two years ago during the Texas trial, I take it, it's like 7 a.m.
[01:27:48.323 --> 01:27:53.026]  And I said, Hey, I was in court yesterday with the Texas plaintiffs and I believe their kid died.
[01:27:53.046 --> 01:27:53.966]  They were great people.
[01:27:54.387 --> 01:27:55.367]  And I'm so sorry for them.
[01:27:56.088 --> 01:27:57.188]  She marches into court.
[01:27:57.248 --> 01:27:59.670]  The judge lets her talk for 10 minutes from the stand attacking me.
[01:28:00.842 --> 01:28:03.482]  Today on your show, you said my kid didn't die.
[01:28:04.243 --> 01:28:05.243]  You said I'm an actress.
[01:28:05.263 --> 01:28:06.043]  You said I'm fake.
[01:28:06.883 --> 01:28:07.943]  And they put it in an HBO show.
[01:28:08.683 --> 01:28:10.684]  And I'm sitting there, and the judge goes, don't talk to me.
[01:28:11.284 --> 01:28:15.505]  And she sat there for HBO and said, you attacked my child today.
[01:28:16.065 --> 01:28:17.065]  You attacked me.
[01:28:17.865 --> 01:28:19.025]  You said I'm not real.
[01:28:19.645 --> 01:28:21.986]  And I got up on the stand later that day, but nobody covered the media.
[01:28:22.006 --> 01:28:24.026]  And I said, lady, go watch my show.
[01:28:24.106 --> 01:28:24.966]  I taped it this morning.
[01:28:25.346 --> 01:28:26.486]  I said, you're a great lady.
[01:28:26.846 --> 01:28:27.767]  I said, your kid died.
[01:28:27.787 --> 01:28:28.607]  I said, I'm sorry.
[01:28:28.987 --> 01:28:30.047]  But it didn't matter.
[01:28:30.751 --> 01:28:33.273]  Because her lawyers told her something different.
[01:28:34.133 --> 01:28:35.094]  And it's on record.
[01:28:35.494 --> 01:28:37.595]  So I'm tired of apologizing to these people.
[01:28:37.955 --> 01:28:39.496]  I didn't plant WMDs in Iraq.
[01:28:39.816 --> 01:28:41.277]  I didn't ship fentanyl across the border.
[01:28:41.578 --> 01:28:42.938]  I didn't have drag queen story time.
[01:28:43.219 --> 01:28:44.659]  I didn't start World War III with Russia.
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.881]  I'm a populist that opposes the globalists.
[01:28:47.121 --> 01:28:48.322]  And that's why they want to silence me.
[01:28:48.542 --> 01:28:50.083]  That's why you should follow me at Real Alex Jones.
[01:28:51.083 --> 01:28:52.544]  And let me just say this too.
[01:28:53.004 --> 01:28:58.868]  Let's clear up this question about conspiracy theory that's being denigrated by these NPCs here.
[01:28:59.724 --> 01:29:08.349]  There is nothing wrong epistemologically with a conspiracy theory, if it's correct, and you can't tell me that conspiracies do not take place.
[01:29:08.769 --> 01:29:19.675]  They do take place, and we have uncovered numerous conspiracies, including the JFK assassination, that even Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:29:19.715 --> 01:29:24.158]  says was conducted by the CIA, if not other actors as well.
[01:29:24.588 --> 01:29:33.690]  So let's clear up this nonsense that conspiracy theories are somehow utterly disingenuous and completely wrong from the outset.
[01:29:33.730 --> 01:29:36.611]  There's nothing epistemologically wrong.
[01:29:36.751 --> 01:29:37.391]  Absolutely!
[01:29:37.531 --> 01:29:40.132]  People are questioning the false narratives, and here's the deal.
[01:29:40.712 --> 01:29:42.072]  I never want to talk about San Diego Key End.
[01:29:42.632 --> 01:29:48.874]  They run PR advertisements all day long on X, raising money off my name, saying he's attacking us.
[01:29:49.194 --> 01:29:50.354]  Help the children, give us money.
[01:29:50.814 --> 01:29:53.735]  I don't ever want to say their name again, but they attack me!
[01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:57.791]  And then they bring this thing up constantly.
[01:29:57.811 --> 01:29:58.951]  It's like a franchise.
[01:29:59.432 --> 01:30:00.672]  What am I supposed to do?
[01:30:00.692 --> 01:30:06.874]  So Brian, I just want to ask you a question on this.
[01:30:06.914 --> 01:30:08.875]  I think I had a conversation with someone offline about this.
[01:30:12.532 --> 01:30:14.793]  Alex, this is how I understand it.
[01:30:15.414 --> 01:30:16.694]  He didn't kill the kids.
[01:30:17.175 --> 01:30:23.838]  He did not cause the situation or the atmosphere that caused the kids to be killed.
[01:30:25.859 --> 01:30:33.683]  Those who disagree with him make the argument that after the fact he questioned things that could have hurt the feelings of the parents.
[01:30:33.803 --> 01:30:35.604]  I mean, did he hurt the feelings of the parents?
[01:30:35.925 --> 01:30:40.167]  The question is, was he or should he be allowed to ask those questions if I've understood it right?
[01:30:41.232 --> 01:30:53.377]  And then his argument is, and then I'll add my own a bit and then I want to ask you the question, his argument is that there's people who have directly caused the death of people and there's been no action towards them.
[01:30:53.397 --> 01:31:09.544]  You know my feeling about many of the people, including yourself, who basically perpetuated this lie about Jihad Day, which caused an extreme atmosphere of Islamophobia, and later either directly, indirectly, or the atmosphere did cause a kid to die.
[01:31:10.097 --> 01:31:12.097]  So, and I'm not sure if that's direct or indirect.
[01:31:12.337 --> 01:31:20.259]  So, I mean, based on that, one may even argue you're much more liable if there was some form of liability and yet no action was taken against any of these people.
[01:31:20.319 --> 01:31:23.839]  I don't even know what you're talking about.
[01:31:23.919 --> 01:31:27.660]  So, I'll answer your question, but you say I'm liable for some kid's death?
[01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:28.640]  I don't even know what you're talking about.
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:29.060]  No, I didn't say that.
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:29.700]  Do you not understand?
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:30.741]  Now he's so close.
[01:31:30.781 --> 01:31:31.441]  He's so close.
[01:31:31.501 --> 01:31:32.121]  Now he gets it.
[01:31:32.141 --> 01:31:32.881]  Now he gets it.
[01:31:33.021 --> 01:31:33.401]  No, no.
[01:31:33.881 --> 01:31:35.421]  No, no, no, no.
[01:31:35.701 --> 01:31:36.282]  No, no.
[01:31:36.362 --> 01:31:38.122]  I said directly, indirectly.
[01:31:38.162 --> 01:31:38.782]  I'll respond.
[01:31:39.375 --> 01:31:39.815]  Atmosphere.
[01:31:40.376 --> 01:31:42.416]  I'll respond to what you're saying.
[01:31:42.717 --> 01:31:47.819]  So I'm not saying that Alex Jones is responsible for anybody's death.
[01:31:47.939 --> 01:31:48.659]  I'm not saying that.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.702]  I'm also not saying there's any comparison to somebody killing somebody.
[01:31:54.802 --> 01:31:57.964]  Then why don't we know... Krasnosti, just say the name Adam Lanza.
[01:31:58.024 --> 01:31:59.905]  I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will.
[01:32:00.205 --> 01:32:01.926]  Krasnosti, just say Adam Lanza.
[01:32:04.167 --> 01:32:06.308]  Brian, Brian, let Krasnosti answer the question.
[01:32:06.368 --> 01:32:08.629]  Brian, will you say the name Adam Lanza?
[01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:12.774]  Brian, go ahead and answer my question as well, because I think we need to give him an answer.
[01:32:12.814 --> 01:32:14.255]  Will you say Adam Lanza?
[01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:15.376]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:15.436 --> 01:32:16.878]  Alex, I think I asked him a question.
[01:32:16.898 --> 01:32:17.498]  Well, let him say it.
[01:32:17.518 --> 01:32:18.099]  Stop, stop, stop.
[01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:18.600]  He said it.
[01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:19.100]  Say it again.
[01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:19.661]  Say it again.
[01:32:19.961 --> 01:32:21.923]  Adam Lanza killed the kids, right?
[01:32:23.685 --> 01:32:23.825]  Yep.
[01:32:24.505 --> 01:32:25.667]  Say Adam Lanza, Adam.
[01:32:26.768 --> 01:32:27.929]  Or, Brian.
[01:32:29.290 --> 01:32:31.372]  Adam, say, say Adam Lanza.
[01:32:31.392 --> 01:32:31.953]  Can you say it?
[01:32:36.041 --> 01:32:37.362]  Adam Lanza is a horrible person.
[01:32:37.402 --> 01:32:38.922]  He's a horrible person.
[01:32:38.862 --> 01:32:42.662]  And what I'm saying is that yes, Alex, come on.
[01:32:42.662 --> 01:32:44.661]  Just say, my audio cut out.
[01:32:44.661 --> 01:32:46.661]  Will you say, they cut it off.
[01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:48.461]  Just say Adam Lanza for me.
[01:32:48.461 --> 01:32:49.461]  I don't understand your point of yes please.
[01:32:49.461 --> 01:32:50.461]  Who is worse?
[01:32:50.461 --> 01:32:51.461]  I'm gonna ask you again.
[01:32:51.461 --> 01:32:52.461]  I'll let you talk.
[01:32:52.461 --> 01:32:53.461]  I'll let you talk.
[01:32:53.461 --> 01:32:54.461]  Let me ask.
[01:32:54.461 --> 01:32:55.462]  Adam Lanza is a horrible person.
[01:32:55.462 --> 01:32:56.462]  He's a horrible person.
[01:32:56.462 --> 01:32:57.462]  What did he do?
[01:32:57.462 --> 01:32:58.462]  He's a murderer.
[01:32:58.462 --> 01:32:59.462]  Wait.
[01:32:59.462 --> 01:33:00.462]  Yeah.
[01:33:00.462 --> 01:33:01.462]  He killed the Sandy Hook kids.
[01:33:01.462 --> 01:33:09.261]   And then you took the deaths of the kids and used it to get your show popular by spouting
[01:33:09.261 --> 01:33:15.662]   lies and putting the parents of these dead kids in a situation where they feared for
[01:33:15.662 --> 01:33:16.662]  their lives.
[01:33:17.421 --> 01:33:20.242]  No, the internet already didn't believe it.
[01:33:20.282 --> 01:33:20.982]  I just discovered it.
[01:33:21.022 --> 01:33:21.382]  It's not true.
[01:33:22.843 --> 01:33:23.763]  Okay, okay, but you told her!
[01:33:23.603 --> 01:33:24.603]  It's not true.
[01:33:24.603 --> 01:33:25.603]  It's not true.
[01:33:25.603 --> 01:33:29.603]  The internet was already going wild with all these theories.
[01:33:29.603 --> 01:33:30.603]  Okay, but who cares?
[01:33:30.603 --> 01:33:31.603]  Hold on, Brian.
[01:33:31.603 --> 01:33:32.603]  It's not who cares.
[01:33:32.603 --> 01:33:33.603]  It's irrelevant to the discussion.
[01:33:33.603 --> 01:33:34.603]   So if the internet is wild enough to be a threat, then why is it not a threat?
[01:33:34.949 --> 01:33:36.949]  It provides context to the discussion.
[01:33:36.949 --> 01:33:38.949]  So does that mean Alex was right in lying?
[01:33:38.949 --> 01:33:43.949]   I know you think you can just talk over me, Brian, and try to make me shut up, but I'm talking right now.
[01:33:43.949 --> 01:33:46.949]  You just spoke over me as I was in the middle.
[01:33:46.949 --> 01:33:51.949]   No, I was responding. And what I'm saying is it is entirely relevant to the discussion.
[01:33:52.345 --> 01:33:57.910]  Because Alex was reporting on what was already going on during that time period all over social media.
[01:33:58.210 --> 01:34:02.193]  And that is why what I brought up earlier is very relevant to the discussion.
[01:34:02.434 --> 01:34:18.435]   When you have trolls out there, and I believe psyops actors out there like Jonathan Lee Riches, who literally went and showed up to the Sandy Hook shootings memorial site and was interviewed by several credible media outlets, You can use me.
[01:34:18.475 --> 01:34:19.536]  You can use me if you want.
[01:34:19.395 --> 01:34:25.715]   and his crazy things, that actually had a rippling effect on social media where people started questioning,
[01:34:25.715 --> 01:34:26.755]  what's going on here?
[01:34:26.755 --> 01:34:28.036]  Are there crisis actors?
[01:34:28.036 --> 01:34:29.234]  Like that's what people were saying.
[01:34:29.234 --> 01:34:30.074]  Something seems up here.
[01:34:30.074 --> 01:34:33.395]  Okay, so Miley, can I ask you a question?
[01:34:33.395 --> 01:34:34.475]  Go ahead.
[01:34:34.475 --> 01:34:35.795]  Can I ask you a question?
[01:34:35.795 --> 01:34:40.996]   So if, say somebody in here, say Sarah, and I'm sorry I'm using Sarah.
[01:34:40.996 --> 01:34:43.395]  You can use me if you want, that's all right.
[01:34:43.395 --> 01:34:44.234]  Say Chase.
[01:34:45.027 --> 01:34:46.067]  I saw it.
[01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:47.768]  No, you're right.
[01:34:47.808 --> 01:34:48.268]  You're right.
[01:34:48.288 --> 01:34:49.368]  Joe Biden is steady and brave.
[01:34:49.408 --> 01:34:50.068]  Crash the scene.
[01:34:50.168 --> 01:34:53.349]  I don't want to talk to Crash the scene.
[01:34:53.369 --> 01:34:55.849]  I don't want to talk to Crash the scene anymore.
[01:34:55.869 --> 01:34:56.990]  Let's go to a new poll.
[01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.730]  I'm going to leave.
[01:34:57.810 --> 01:34:58.090]  I'm not mad.
[01:34:57.909 --> 01:35:02.349]   neighborhood. And I know that for a fact. Now, does that make me saying that?
[01:35:02.349 --> 01:35:06.069]  No, you're right. Joe Biden is studying brave. Krasnostine.
[01:35:06.069 --> 01:35:09.949]   Does that make me not liable for defamation because Chase said that?
[01:35:09.949 --> 01:35:12.470]   I don't want to talk to Krasnostine anymore. Let's go to a new poll. I'm going to leave.
[01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:14.670]  I'm not mad. I can't handle it.
[01:35:14.670 --> 01:35:21.189]   How about if many credible media outlets started posting interviews saying this is Miley's
[01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:24.989]  relative and he's a credible witness on the subject?
[01:35:25.665 --> 01:35:27.867]  And then you read those and you believed it.
[01:35:27.927 --> 01:35:32.370]  Now everyone on the internet is reading this stuff and getting whipped up into not knowing what's going on.
[01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:36.513]  I mean, that's more along the lines of what we're talking about.
[01:35:37.333 --> 01:35:38.875]  We're not talking about a random guy.
[01:35:41.178 --> 01:35:47.940]  The world doesn't know how definitions work, so if you say something as a fact, it doesn't matter who else said it.
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:55.902]  If you say it's a fact, rather than say, oh, Miley said this, or oh, Chase said this, then there's definitely a definition.
[01:35:56.042 --> 01:35:59.603]  I want to know this, Brian.
[01:36:00.423 --> 01:36:05.845]  Before you told all these people that the Russian dossier was fake, did you have first-hand knowledge?
[01:36:06.105 --> 01:36:06.925]  Did you see it?
[01:36:08.104 --> 01:36:12.359]  Or were you going based off of what other credible media outlets were reporting?
[01:36:13.871 --> 01:36:16.513]  Wait, before I said the Russian dossier was fake?
[01:36:16.573 --> 01:36:25.759]  No, when you were saying that, oh, you know, this is a real thing, the Russian dossier, were you going off of media outlets and their reports?
[01:36:26.199 --> 01:36:27.440]  Wait, I never said that!
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:28.781]  I never said that!
[01:36:28.801 --> 01:36:33.584]  Did you see it first-hand yourself and see that it was 100% real because you saw it first-hand?
[01:36:33.604 --> 01:36:35.625]  Alright, Lord Krasnospin's been here long enough.
[01:36:35.685 --> 01:36:36.546]  I never said that.
[01:36:36.646 --> 01:36:39.267]  I never said the Russian dossier was real.
[01:36:39.507 --> 01:36:41.709]  Alright, Lord Krasnospin... Six years ago.
[01:36:41.989 --> 01:36:46.611]  I never said that.
[01:36:47.011 --> 01:36:53.353]  Alex, I know you don't want Krasinskian to talk, but like, I mean, I know you feel like he's talked a lot, but then everyone's asking him questions.
[01:36:53.393 --> 01:36:55.674]  Like now Millie's asked him a question and he's responding.
[01:36:55.754 --> 01:36:56.635]  I asked him a question.
[01:36:56.655 --> 01:36:59.836]  Uh, you, I think a few other people mentioned him and asked him questions.
[01:36:59.856 --> 01:37:06.458]  So like a good way of making sure someone doesn't like be so heavily in a conversation is to not ask him so many questions.
[01:37:06.478 --> 01:37:07.859]  Like now Millie's asked him a question.
[01:37:07.679 --> 01:37:08.679]  He's going to respond, right?
[01:37:08.679 --> 01:37:09.679]  Sully...
[01:37:09.679 --> 01:37:17.278]  I can't hear Solomon if he's speaking.
[01:37:17.891 --> 01:37:19.332]  Yeah, he said go ahead, Brian.
[01:37:19.372 --> 01:37:21.812]  So go ahead, Brian, finish up your point.
[01:37:21.832 --> 01:37:23.133]  And we'll move on.
[01:37:26.334 --> 01:37:27.094]  Can you hear me, Brian?
[01:37:27.114 --> 01:37:30.635]  Brian, you're supposed to finish your point.
[01:37:30.454 --> 01:37:33.734]   We'll try and bring it back. Go ahead Chase, make it, you had your hand up.
[01:37:33.734 --> 01:37:37.333]  Yeah, I just, really quick, there's a couple of things here.
[01:37:37.570 --> 01:37:41.511]  So one of the issues that came up in this conversation is fairly poignant.
[01:37:41.531 --> 01:37:55.597]  So the argument is that because of Alex Jones's large audience and because he speculated as to the details of Sandy Hook those years ago, it resulted in death threats for the family and emotional damages.
[01:37:55.637 --> 01:37:57.278]  That's the general argument here, right?
[01:37:58.064 --> 01:38:02.526]  And there's a couple of things I just want to throw out there as additional variables.
[01:38:02.726 --> 01:38:07.188]  First thing is, you know, I was in the courtroom on Friday and Alex Jones is the one that needs a bodyguard.
[01:38:07.608 --> 01:38:10.489]  And you don't see plaintiffs walking into the courtroom with their own bodyguards.
[01:38:10.509 --> 01:38:30.445]   So this argument they actually genuinely feared for their Lives is something I'm very skeptical about maybe it was different five years ago or six years ago when this was a hotter topic Or something like that, so I don't deny that you know maybe they got some flack from the audience But I just don't really buy that there's a legitimate fear of for the lives the second thing I want to draw everyone's attention to is
[01:38:31.005 --> 01:38:35.767]  The estate of Adam Lanza was sued for 1.5 million dollars.
[01:38:36.427 --> 01:38:39.589]  And so Alex Jones has been sued for 1.5 billion dollars.
[01:38:39.969 --> 01:38:48.913]  According to the court of law, if you just look at the numbers, he's somehow a thousand times more monetarily culpable than the actual killer of those kids, which I find incredibly bizarre.
[01:38:48.933 --> 01:38:50.932]   Now you could say, well, Adam Lanza didn't have any money.
[01:38:50.932 --> 01:38:54.573]  That's why Alex Jones also doesn't have $1.5 billion.
[01:38:54.573 --> 01:39:00.373]   And I just think there's something very malicious going on with the way that this has been litigated that is unjust.
[01:39:00.373 --> 01:39:04.533]   And this is not me apologizing for any mistakes that Alex might've made or saying that he was right
[01:39:04.533 --> 01:39:09.533]  or just trying to be totally an apologetic person.
[01:39:09.157 --> 01:39:09.817]  Let's go to Joah.
[01:39:09.637 --> 01:39:14.197]   here. I'm just saying this is so obviously screwed up regardless of whether or not Alex
[01:39:14.197 --> 01:39:18.236]   made some genuine mistakes that I think people should really try to look at it from that
[01:39:18.236 --> 01:39:20.877]  perspective. That's all I wanted to add to the group.
[01:39:20.877 --> 01:39:27.037]   Let's go to, thanks for that, Jess. Let's go to Joe. Go ahead, Joe.
[01:39:27.037 --> 01:39:31.237]  Someone came up here and said that, look, Alex was targeted.
[01:39:31.166 --> 01:39:36.889]  There was a book that said no one was shot at Sandy Hook, and they didn't go after them.
[01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:38.489]  Well, they did go after them.
[01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:40.770]  They were also found liable of defamation.
[01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:45.052]  This is not a targeted attack against Alex.
[01:39:45.633 --> 01:39:47.033]  Like, I used to like Alex Show.
[01:39:47.133 --> 01:39:55.017]  I stopped liking it when, you know, you say colloidal silver is the cure for COVID, but then you're selling it yourself.
[01:39:56.187 --> 01:39:57.127]  I feel like it's just me.
[01:39:57.187 --> 01:39:59.108]  You lying scumbag.
[01:39:59.568 --> 01:40:01.248]  Another leftist turd.
[01:40:01.828 --> 01:40:06.849]  Dude, we sell colloidal silver as an antibiotic, as a topical.
[01:40:06.929 --> 01:40:07.969]  It's a well-known thing.
[01:40:08.029 --> 01:40:12.450]  It's sold in CVS, Whole Foods, Walgreens.
[01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:15.711]  I love to be like, don't sell colloidal silver!
[01:40:15.771 --> 01:40:18.351]  Did the Attorney General say you need to stop selling it as a cure?
[01:40:18.411 --> 01:40:19.612]  Oh yeah, you're right, you're right.
[01:40:20.292 --> 01:40:20.872]  Right, I'm right.
[01:40:21.403 --> 01:40:21.723]  Shut up!
[01:40:21.763 --> 01:40:22.244]  Let me finish!
[01:40:22.324 --> 01:40:23.765]  Alright, I'm gonna hang up.
[01:40:23.825 --> 01:40:26.828]  If I can't respond, I'm gonna hang up.
[01:40:26.888 --> 01:40:27.668]  Okay, okay.
[01:40:27.728 --> 01:40:29.690]  Alex, let Alex respond, Joe.
[01:40:29.710 --> 01:40:32.592]  Joe, let him respond.
[01:40:32.652 --> 01:40:34.814]  I want to respond to your live chat.
[01:40:34.834 --> 01:40:35.575]  Joe, let him respond.
[01:40:35.615 --> 01:40:36.195]  Go ahead, Alex.
[01:40:37.617 --> 01:40:39.338]  This is a perfect microcosm.
[01:40:40.279 --> 01:40:41.360]  I've been on air 30 years.
[01:40:43.121 --> 01:40:47.865]  And, like, 28 years ago, I got approached by sponsors at a global silver.
[01:40:48.446 --> 01:40:50.067]  Now, that's before it was in Whole Foods.
[01:40:51.044 --> 01:40:54.127]  And before it was in CVS and Walgreens and Vons.
[01:40:55.247 --> 01:40:58.250]  Silver is now in hospitals sprayed better than Iodine.
[01:40:59.331 --> 01:41:03.554]  And so he calls in and goes, Oh, you're running a scam.
[01:41:04.255 --> 01:41:06.216]  You sell colloidal silver.
[01:41:06.236 --> 01:41:09.939]  Colloidal silver is sold at Whole Foods.
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:12.501]  We were right before that.
[01:41:12.961 --> 01:41:16.404]  It's an incredible antibiotic, antiviral, antibacterial.
[01:41:16.845 --> 01:41:18.606]  We just sell, I private labeled.
[01:41:19.936 --> 01:41:28.336]   the same colloidal silver made by Whole Foods. It's the same top manufacturer, 300 parts per million.
[01:41:28.336 --> 01:41:35.056]   So this guy pops in, he says, "You're a scammer. You're selling colloidal silver. Ladies and
[01:41:35.056 --> 01:41:38.975]  gentlemen, go to Walgreens." That's not what I said, Alex.
[01:41:38.975 --> 01:41:46.176]   No, no, no. You just said, go ahead. You just said, no, I didn't say silver would cure COVID.
[01:41:46.401 --> 01:41:48.521]  Letitia James... I have your quote.
[01:41:48.581 --> 01:41:50.262]  Let me finish, let me finish, let me finish.
[01:41:50.682 --> 01:41:53.583]  You said the government doesn't want you to know about the cure, which is colloidal silver.
[01:41:53.603 --> 01:41:54.823]  Let me finish, let me finish.
[01:41:55.343 --> 01:41:56.043]  Now make your point.
[01:41:56.283 --> 01:41:58.024]  Yeah, the government doesn't want you to know.
[01:41:58.084 --> 01:42:12.308]  Letitia James, put in by George Soros in New York, that's run the prosecution against Trump, came out and never filed charges, she claimed she would, claiming, I was claiming a COVID cure, I never did.
[01:42:13.649 --> 01:42:15.951]  Topically, sunlight kills COVID.
[01:42:16.292 --> 01:42:17.633]  So does water.
[01:42:18.474 --> 01:42:22.238]  I sell colloidal silver products and never claim that.
[01:42:22.318 --> 01:42:24.881]  You just tried another lie.
[01:42:25.822 --> 01:42:27.684]  Silver is just another antibiotic.
[01:42:28.428 --> 01:42:34.593]  Everybody knows that and you literally just sit there with your federal feed attacking us.
[01:42:34.613 --> 01:42:39.498]  Maybe you shouldn't have said the government doesn't want you to know about the cure for coronavirus.
[01:42:40.178 --> 01:42:41.339]  It's colloidal silver.
[01:42:41.359 --> 01:42:42.080]  You're a liar!
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:42.580]  You're a liar!
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:51.919]   if we're a liar, you're a liar, you're a liar, I never said that you are a dirty government
[01:42:51.919 --> 01:42:55.919]  liar who sent an email by the deep state.
[01:42:55.919 --> 01:42:57.919]  I never got charged with defamation so.
[01:42:57.919 --> 01:43:02.000]   Oh yeah, oh another court never did, because you're a nobody.
[01:43:02.033 --> 01:43:06.534]  You serve the system, that's why you were never attacked, and now you try this attack.
[01:43:06.934 --> 01:43:08.454]  Silver is amazing, folks.
[01:43:08.794 --> 01:43:10.194]  Don't listen to this dirtbag.
[01:43:10.895 --> 01:43:11.675]  It's amazing.
[01:43:11.755 --> 01:43:12.535]  Don't listen to him.
[01:43:12.875 --> 01:43:14.015]  Good job.
[01:43:14.055 --> 01:43:14.435]  Good job.
[01:43:14.475 --> 01:43:19.036]  He never mentioned... I'm going to go to... one second, guys.
[01:43:19.076 --> 01:43:19.677]  You're disgusted.
[01:43:19.837 --> 01:43:20.317]  Dr. Michael.
[01:43:20.537 --> 01:43:21.297]  Dr. Michael, go ahead.
[01:43:22.898 --> 01:43:27.701]  Yes, I mean, just in response to this latest comment here about silver.
[01:43:28.302 --> 01:43:37.828]  Here is the federal government telling us that the coronavirus vaccine was safe and effective, proven to be utterly untrue.
[01:43:37.869 --> 01:43:45.474]  It's in fact, it has a negative efficacy over six months and has no ability to stop any spread.
[01:43:46.118 --> 01:43:50.724]  In fact, it hasn't even the ability to keep the people who take it from getting COVID.
[01:43:50.784 --> 01:43:55.610]  So why isn't he referring to that, which was a massive government program and rollout?
[01:43:55.871 --> 01:43:57.713]  You're the one that lied about the book.
[01:43:57.773 --> 01:43:59.315]  The book authors didn't get charged.
[01:43:59.596 --> 01:44:00.837]  I didn't lie.
[01:44:00.977 --> 01:44:04.867]   I recognized that the book authors We're sued for $450,000.
[01:44:05.227 --> 01:44:11.191]  That's a far cry from 1.4 billion dollars.
[01:44:11.331 --> 01:44:16.315]  Doctor, you did initially state that nobody had gone after the author of that book.
[01:44:16.755 --> 01:44:17.475]  And they did.
[01:44:18.316 --> 01:44:23.520]  I meant to say that nobody had sued them for the likes of what Alex Jones was sued for.
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:26.261]  1.4 billion dollars.
[01:44:26.421 --> 01:44:26.802]  Fine.
[01:44:26.822 --> 01:44:28.383]  Listen, let me just say this in closing.
[01:44:28.403 --> 01:44:29.003]  I'm going to leave.
[01:44:29.784 --> 01:44:30.905]  Take all your shots.
[01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:32.846]  World government's good.
[01:44:33.917 --> 01:44:35.498]  Drag Queen Story Time is good.
[01:44:36.118 --> 01:44:37.378]  It's all good.
[01:44:37.398 --> 01:44:39.039]  Do what the government says.
[01:44:39.099 --> 01:44:39.959]  They love you.
[01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:41.700]  They care about you.
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:43.681]  Be like the Krasnyskys.
[01:44:43.761 --> 01:44:44.901]  Give in to world government.
[01:44:45.762 --> 01:44:47.422]  Cut your son's genitals off.
[01:44:47.502 --> 01:44:48.703]  Cut your daughter's breasts off.
[01:44:49.263 --> 01:44:50.384]  Just do whatever they say.
[01:44:50.404 --> 01:44:51.964]  It's going to be a lot better.
[01:44:51.984 --> 01:44:54.305]  Just do what they say.
[01:44:54.425 --> 01:44:55.486]  Everything's okay.
[01:44:56.006 --> 01:44:57.446]  Worship world government.
[01:44:57.867 --> 01:44:59.487]  Don't follow me at Real Alex Jones.
[01:45:00.088 --> 01:45:01.608]  Just worship world government.
[01:45:02.088 --> 01:45:02.749]  Worship it.
[01:45:02.569 --> 01:45:03.569]  It's so good.
[01:45:03.569 --> 01:45:13.769]   I mean, how about when, when Como publicly ridiculed Joe Rogan for using ivermectin?
[01:45:13.721 --> 01:45:17.225]  I mean, the media kind of came out and said that, and that was a blatant lie.
[01:45:17.725 --> 01:45:24.671]  And they knew that Ivermectin was prescribed, and they basically made it out to be some crazy, you know, conspiracy theory.
[01:45:24.711 --> 01:45:26.092]  You're a terrorist!
[01:45:26.913 --> 01:45:31.473]  Take the shots, join Jesus, leave the earth, just die.
[01:45:31.473 --> 01:45:33.473]  It's not bein' like this.
[01:45:33.473 --> 01:45:35.473]  Just join the Karazhstins.
[01:45:35.473 --> 01:45:37.473]  Just take the shots.
[01:45:37.056 --> 01:45:37.756]  Roll back.
[01:45:37.776 --> 01:45:38.556]  It's so good.
[01:45:39.077 --> 01:45:40.698]  Give the Krazensteins the Earth.
[01:45:41.478 --> 01:45:42.418]  Give them the Earth.
[01:45:42.479 --> 01:45:43.719]  Krazensteins rule us.
[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:45.360]  Oh my God.
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:46.121]  Sully.
[01:45:48.082 --> 01:45:51.163]  Alex, this sounds like you're kind of... No, it's beautiful!
[01:45:51.544 --> 01:45:54.645]  Hey Krazenstein, you love the 35 million dead.
[01:45:54.985 --> 01:45:56.146]  You love all the dead.
[01:45:56.186 --> 01:45:57.167]  You love the poison.
[01:45:57.467 --> 01:45:58.507]  You love Pfizer.
[01:45:58.547 --> 01:45:59.168]  You love it.
[01:45:59.228 --> 01:46:01.249]  You love the new world.
[01:46:01.269 --> 01:46:01.789]  It's on you.
[01:46:01.809 --> 01:46:03.170]  The death is on you.
[01:46:05.299 --> 01:46:06.741]  Why are the dead on me?
[01:46:06.581 --> 01:46:09.020]  Here goes the Mingala now.
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:12.181]  Baby Presidine Mingala.
[01:46:12.181 --> 01:46:14.260]  Why are the dead on me?
[01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:15.860]  Can you explain that to me?
[01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:20.860]  Record level deaths according to overall comorbidity.
[01:46:21.043 --> 01:46:22.184]  40 plus percent increase.
[01:46:22.584 --> 01:46:23.785]  But what's it have to do with you?
[01:46:23.805 --> 01:46:25.126]  You love the system.
[01:46:25.486 --> 01:46:26.787]  You're part of the system.
[01:46:27.247 --> 01:46:29.169]  You sit there worshipping it.
[01:46:29.469 --> 01:46:32.091]  So I want to say Krasenstein loves it.
[01:46:32.431 --> 01:46:33.892]  He loves the New World Order.
[01:46:34.232 --> 01:46:35.633]  He loves the globalists.
[01:46:35.653 --> 01:46:38.675]  I just want to say, in your... Based on what?
[01:46:38.695 --> 01:46:39.996]  What do you mean?
[01:46:40.357 --> 01:46:41.778]  Tell us, should we take the tenth?
[01:46:42.258 --> 01:46:44.380]  Krasenstein, should we take the tenth?
[01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:51.087]  You're just making stuff up right now.
[01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:56.914]  I think it's up to whatever people want to do.
[01:46:57.394 --> 01:46:59.697]  I think it's up to whatever we do.
[01:46:59.737 --> 01:47:01.319]  Nobody made us take it.
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:03.782]  Nobody tried to make us take it.
[01:47:04.255 --> 01:47:06.736]  Nobody tried to lie to you?
[01:47:06.796 --> 01:47:09.057]  He wants to deny he did it to you.
[01:47:09.377 --> 01:47:12.058]  He wants you to forget what he did when he did it.
[01:47:12.098 --> 01:47:13.199]  Hey, Krasistein!
[01:47:13.399 --> 01:47:14.099]  Krasistein!
[01:47:14.459 --> 01:47:16.840]  You ever took any Pfizer money, Krasistein?
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:19.241]  You ever took any Pfizer money, Krasistein?
[01:47:20.321 --> 01:47:22.342]  No, I've never been paid by any pharmaceutical company.
[01:47:22.362 --> 01:47:23.603]  You ever took a little Moderna money?
[01:47:23.963 --> 01:47:24.423]  How about you?
[01:47:24.443 --> 01:47:26.284]  A little money, Krasistein?
[01:47:26.464 --> 01:47:27.644]  Did Pfizer pay you?
[01:47:27.724 --> 01:47:32.186]  I don't think anyone pays him to be this stupid, Alex, unfortunately.
[01:47:32.930 --> 01:47:38.132]  Well, let me ask you, Alex, have you ever taken any money from any pharmaceutical company?
[01:47:38.492 --> 01:47:39.072]  No, I'm not.
[01:47:40.493 --> 01:47:41.293]  Absolutely not.
[01:47:41.873 --> 01:47:43.654]  So back to... Oh, hey.
[01:47:44.454 --> 01:47:44.914]  Me neither.
[01:47:44.954 --> 01:47:46.755]  So we have something in common.
[01:47:46.895 --> 01:47:47.415]  Me neither.
[01:47:47.515 --> 01:47:47.995]  I'm a lawyer.
[01:47:48.015 --> 01:47:49.036]  Do you want to go hang out?
[01:47:49.056 --> 01:47:51.696]  All right.
[01:47:51.716 --> 01:47:52.757]  I've had fun for two hours.
[01:47:52.777 --> 01:47:54.878]  I'm going to leave and hang out with my family.
[01:47:54.918 --> 01:47:56.038]  Follow me at Relox Jones.
[01:47:56.693 --> 01:47:58.014]  You guys, I'm the devil.
[01:47:58.134 --> 01:47:58.934]  I'm the bad guy.
[01:47:59.154 --> 01:48:00.155]  WMDs don't matter.
[01:48:00.575 --> 01:48:01.836]  World government doesn't matter.
[01:48:02.416 --> 01:48:03.476]  Open borders don't matter.
[01:48:03.717 --> 01:48:05.277]  Alex Jones is the bad guy.
[01:48:05.457 --> 01:48:06.038]  I agree.
[01:48:06.518 --> 01:48:06.978]  I'm here.
[01:48:07.138 --> 01:48:07.779]  I'm the bad guy.
[01:48:07.819 --> 01:48:08.999]  Don't follow me on Alex Jones.
[01:48:09.319 --> 01:48:09.619]  No, no.
[01:48:09.659 --> 01:48:10.560]  Follow Alex Jones.
[01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:12.201]  Let me go to Trickstep, right?
[01:48:12.241 --> 01:48:15.502]  Trickstep, you said that you are a CT defendant.
[01:48:16.003 --> 01:48:18.484]  Everything Alex is saying is correct.
[01:48:18.624 --> 01:48:19.124]  Do jump in.
[01:48:19.144 --> 01:48:20.185]  What is it you wanted to say?
[01:48:23.197 --> 01:48:36.164]  Yeah, I was the CT defendant that was actually dismissed by the plaintiffs, which according to state law that was brought up to the Connecticut Supreme Court, should have legally dropped the entire case from the state of Connecticut to begin with.
[01:48:36.765 --> 01:48:54.310]   And for the record here in the phone call, Alex, this is the first time I believe I've ever talked to you regarding anything, and I'm going to say, for the record, we have never met Uh, in which the plaintiffs, uh, originally in the case in Connecticut, said that apparently we did a marketing scheme.
[01:48:55.451 --> 01:48:56.711]  Uh, that is unfactual.
[01:48:57.251 --> 01:49:00.013]  Yeah, I don't know who you are, so we're supposedly in business?
[01:49:01.633 --> 01:49:02.914]  Uh, apparently so, Alex.
[01:49:03.274 --> 01:49:11.217]  And, uh, regarding Wolfgang Halbig, again, he was just a small, tiny acquaintance on a bigger version of a controversy.
[01:49:12.057 --> 01:49:15.739]  But with the people that were following me, uh, what, what are we going back now?
[01:49:16.199 --> 01:49:16.859]  Seven years ago?
[01:49:17.930 --> 01:49:54.773]   In a FOIA office who got me on camera that decided to say hey this guy's doing a marketing scheme so for the record for everybody I know some of the individuals in this case and I am the Connecticut taxpayer and never had a say in the entire Sandy Hook case to begin with but yet the entire media across the board said me and him are business partners Yet not a single ounce of evidence has ever been produced from the original complaint, which should have killed this lawsuit dead in its tracks to begin with.
[01:49:55.433 --> 01:50:02.916]  So everybody who is a near hearsayer up in here that I've been listening to for six years, none of you know what you're talking about.
[01:50:03.777 --> 01:50:05.938]  None of you are probably even a Connecticut taxpayer.
[01:50:06.518 --> 01:50:18.610]   And for the record, my voice is just as important in this case because this case should have gotten dismissed The instant that the plaintiffs voluntarily removed me from it.
[01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:22.131]  Well, I don't know who you are, so what are you saying happens?
[01:50:24.132 --> 01:50:25.052]  What am I saying happen?
[01:50:26.313 --> 01:50:30.895]  Is someone made up a case against Alex Jones and myself.
[01:50:32.736 --> 01:50:33.236]  They made it up.
[01:50:33.256 --> 01:50:34.196]  But who are you?
[01:50:34.276 --> 01:50:36.897]  Because Alex Jones is saying he doesn't know who you are.
[01:50:38.818 --> 01:50:41.079]  I was the Connecticut defendant in the Connecticut court case.
[01:50:41.479 --> 01:50:43.000]  Okay, so tell us those stories.
[01:50:43.812 --> 01:50:45.653]  Explain it, because we're not understanding your point.
[01:50:45.673 --> 01:50:46.034]  Go ahead.
[01:50:48.335 --> 01:51:01.786]  So, individual lawsuits had started to happen in 2018 to where I was actually out of the state and a lawsuit appeared at my neighbor's door saying that I was a defendant in the case in Connecticut.
[01:51:01.826 --> 01:51:02.987]  Which case, though, sir?
[01:51:03.027 --> 01:51:04.388]  Which case and what were you defending?
[01:51:05.629 --> 01:51:06.649]  There was only one case.
[01:51:06.669 --> 01:51:08.831]  Do you want to explain it for the audience?
[01:51:08.871 --> 01:51:09.852]  Do you want to explain it?
[01:51:09.872 --> 01:51:11.473]  Because no one understands what you're talking about.
[01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:17.563]  Pretend like someone doesn't know what you're talking about at all, and say, guess what?
[01:51:17.943 --> 01:51:21.525]  X happened and I was involved because of Y. Go ahead.
[01:51:21.965 --> 01:51:22.246]  Okay.
[01:51:23.406 --> 01:51:42.638]  Because I was so caught off guard, I was served with a lawsuit about a binder book thick, being claimed as a defendant, again, with Alex Jones, with multiple other defendants, in which parties here in the state of Connecticut had served a defamation case against us.
[01:51:43.553 --> 01:51:46.074]  Why were you a defendant in the case?
[01:51:45.894 --> 01:51:51.054]   no no understanding of I didn't know who the defendants I'm sorry any of the
[01:51:51.054 --> 01:51:53.944]  other defendants were or any other plaintiffs except mr.
[01:51:53.944 --> 01:51:59.583]   Hal big that was quoted in the case problem is I didn't understand why Alex
[01:51:59.583 --> 01:52:03.923]   Jones was actually brought into the case at all because I personally did not
[01:52:03.923 --> 01:52:08.733]   know him why were you a defense look why were you a defendant in the case
[01:52:08.733 --> 01:52:14.654]   according to the actual complaint in which mr. any of these guys right here Brian
[01:52:14.654 --> 01:52:19.356]   you two can bring up I just explained to me.
[01:52:19.477 --> 01:52:31.881]  I, I, I allegedly, uh, created a marketing scheme and business transaction slash, uh, I don't even know what you would word it as some sort of scheme to create money for Alex Jones.
[01:52:32.801 --> 01:52:35.082]  That's an absolute, it's a lie.
[01:52:35.542 --> 01:52:36.462]  This is a guy that owes us.
[01:52:36.562 --> 01:52:37.563]  This is a guy that owes us $1.5 billion.
[01:52:39.588 --> 01:52:42.390]  Yeah, so they just use you as a nexus point.
[01:52:43.931 --> 01:52:54.379]  Yeah, they not only use me as a nexus point, I have received some little friends on my doorstop in multiple locations, including my family members.
[01:52:56.140 --> 01:53:01.023]  Particularly from... I remember you, you're the guy that called the FBI head that set this up, right?
[01:53:03.145 --> 01:53:03.645]  I did not.
[01:53:03.765 --> 01:53:08.549]  Actually, I did not even know the FBI head except one of my co-workers that actually knew him.
[01:53:09.292 --> 01:53:17.416]  Which threw it for a foul, because that's when I actually found out he was the legal head of the New Haven FBI.
[01:53:18.116 --> 01:53:27.101]  And I knew individuals up here that knew him, and until it's brought into court of law, that testimony will be brought forward eventually.
[01:53:27.801 --> 01:53:30.662]  But he will say he's never met me in his entire life.
[01:53:34.644 --> 01:53:35.424]  If that makes any sense.
[01:53:35.444 --> 01:53:36.185]  Man, I don't know.
[01:53:36.245 --> 01:53:38.526]  I just covered the internet question in the shooting.
[01:53:38.885 --> 01:53:39.766]  You did nothing wrong, Alex.
[01:53:39.786 --> 01:53:46.490]  And to hear for BAT, what really happened was that certain attorneys were working with the actual plaintiff's attorneys in this case.
[01:53:46.350 --> 01:53:51.229]  the FBI. I don't know anymore, Matt. This is totally insane.
[01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:57.070]   You did nothing wrong, Alex. And to hear for that, what really happened was that certain
[01:53:57.070 --> 01:54:03.270]   attorneys were working with the actual plaintiff's attorneys in this case. And when I found out
[01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:11.470]   the USAA was actually attempting to try and garnish a judgment to where nobody would be
[01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:13.310]  able to be covered under insurance.
[01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:14.431]  I fired my attorney.
[01:54:14.471 --> 01:54:16.112]  That's actually representative in the case.
[01:54:17.453 --> 01:54:23.457]  All of a sudden, 48 hours later, the plaintiffs give me a call and literally removed me from the case.
[01:54:24.678 --> 01:54:26.799]  So no other further questions or statements.
[01:54:26.899 --> 01:54:28.821]  Nothing binding ever happened.
[01:54:28.841 --> 01:54:31.642]  Yeah, they were using you to tie me into the state.
[01:54:31.683 --> 01:54:34.124]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:54:34.144 --> 01:54:35.425]  And that's absolutely unfair.
[01:54:35.605 --> 01:54:41.545]   And what I didn't understand is within that case, How do you have other federal employees suing other federal employees?
[01:54:43.606 --> 01:54:48.830]  So look, I think most of the audience I'm getting messages still don't understand what tricks I'm saying.
[01:54:48.850 --> 01:54:52.332]  So Chase, if you understood what he says, can you kind of explain it to the audience?
[01:54:53.211 --> 01:54:54.292]  I don't understand anything.
[01:54:54.893 --> 01:55:00.738]  I'm not saying that he's full of shit or anything, I just don't get it.
[01:55:00.898 --> 01:55:01.999]  No, no, I'm not saying that.
[01:55:02.039 --> 01:55:04.662]  It just means he's not communicating his position.
[01:55:04.682 --> 01:55:06.343]  Well, it's just so complicated, it's hard.
[01:55:06.944 --> 01:55:09.226]  Chase, is this part of the Sandy Hook case?
[01:55:09.626 --> 01:55:12.009]  What case is he referring to specifically, sir?
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:14.041]  I don't know why you think I know.
[01:55:14.102 --> 01:55:15.443]  I've just been working here for one year.
[01:55:15.483 --> 01:55:16.484]  I'm trying to keep us on air.
[01:55:16.524 --> 01:55:18.286]  That's all.
[01:55:19.006 --> 01:55:28.035]  The only case in Connecticut is the Sandy Hook case to where basically my fellow taxpayers were suing me as another fellow taxpayer for no reason and lied within the case.
[01:55:28.075 --> 01:55:28.335]  Right.
[01:55:28.415 --> 01:55:28.896]  One second.
[01:55:28.916 --> 01:55:29.617]  Let's break that.
[01:55:29.677 --> 01:55:30.517]  I want you to break it down.
[01:55:30.538 --> 01:55:35.002]  So the Sandy Hook case, you were a defendant in the case, correct?
[01:55:36.488 --> 01:55:39.069]  Yes, it's the only way according to the law that could happen.
[01:55:39.129 --> 01:55:43.171]  I'm just going to ask you a question that you need to answer because I kind of let it go for like 10-15 minutes.
[01:55:43.191 --> 01:55:44.251]  Yeah, how did you get ahead of me?
[01:55:44.831 --> 01:55:51.174]  Yeah, so what was the reason why you were a defendant in the Sandy Hill case?
[01:55:52.434 --> 01:55:53.775]  Please explain, concisely.
[01:55:53.795 --> 01:55:57.736]  To begin with, it all started over a public hearing.
[01:55:57.756 --> 01:55:59.477]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:55:59.557 --> 01:56:01.298]  One second, I don't want to know why it started.
[01:56:01.798 --> 01:56:06.739]   I want to know from you, what is the claim That they made against you.
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:10.182]  That I was directly in business with Alex Jones.
[01:56:10.222 --> 01:56:19.810]  So they claim, but why is it that you being directly in business with Alex Jones makes you liable for the Sunday Hook?
[01:56:22.312 --> 01:56:25.375]  My point is, is that it doesn't make me liable at all.
[01:56:25.535 --> 01:56:28.197]  It was because... But why did they claim it?
[01:56:29.158 --> 01:56:33.862]  Mario, you're not... I don't think anyone... Painting the conspirator in Connecticut.
[01:56:34.431 --> 01:56:35.931]  So they randomly picked this guy?
[01:56:37.332 --> 01:56:37.572]  Yes.
[01:56:38.012 --> 01:56:52.996]  Because a film crew that happened to be in a FOIA office that was allegedly around my face, they decided to use me because there's the only Connecticut defendant there that they could tie to any individual that was in the office.
[01:56:53.016 --> 01:56:54.897]  Yeah, they need to kill conspirator in the state.
[01:56:55.461 --> 01:57:00.047]  Which my lawyers always wondered, how do they put you in the state?
[01:57:00.648 --> 01:57:01.670]  Who is your co-person?
[01:57:01.690 --> 01:57:02.651]  I said, I don't know anybody.
[01:57:03.092 --> 01:57:08.179]  Now this guy calls in, they randomly pick some dude to get it put in the state as a conspiracy.
[01:57:09.207 --> 01:57:21.635]  It sounds like what he's describing is that they used this guy to get jurisdiction for Connecticut, and then he was removed later from the case, which should have removed their jurisdiction.
[01:57:22.175 --> 01:57:24.496]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:57:24.517 --> 01:57:24.496]  100%.
[01:57:24.637 --> 01:57:26.358]  And that is my argument to this day.
[01:57:26.758 --> 01:57:38.254]   And I feel I'm obligated to at least speak that because that is the missing point that the media And I know a lot of attorneys across the nation know exactly what I'm saying.
[01:57:38.334 --> 01:57:41.757]  This case should have never been moved forward at all.
[01:57:41.938 --> 01:57:51.748]  So just to summarize for the audience, they needed someone who was a co-conscriptor in the same state.
[01:57:52.523 --> 01:57:53.304]  Well, I just have a question.
[01:57:53.324 --> 01:57:54.525]  Would that make it open to appeal?
[01:57:54.345 --> 01:58:00.945]   were the said person to essentially bring the case in that state, afterwards you were
[01:58:00.945 --> 01:58:04.744]  removed but for some reason the case continued.
[01:58:04.744 --> 01:58:05.744]  Yes.
[01:58:05.744 --> 01:58:06.744]  Okay.
[01:58:06.744 --> 01:58:07.744]  So that means...
[01:58:07.744 --> 01:58:08.744]  100% fact.
[01:58:08.744 --> 01:58:09.744]  Okay, I get that.
[01:58:09.744 --> 01:58:14.945]   So is there any kind of pushback to that proposition by anybody on the other side?
[01:58:14.945 --> 01:58:16.184]  Well I just have a question.
[01:58:16.184 --> 01:58:18.824]  Would that make it open to appeal?
[01:58:18.824 --> 01:58:22.345]  Yeah, thanks for telling us now.
[01:58:22.345 --> 01:58:31.784]   Listen guys, these guys have known the facts and so have the other side attorneys, whether
[01:58:31.784 --> 01:58:37.145]  they have disclosed that or not under their "conditions".
[01:58:37.244 --> 01:58:45.871]  I have never, and this is also for the record, I have never, ever, made any commitment to that at all.
[01:58:49.456 --> 01:58:52.565]  I mean, this is probably the first time you're hearing this.
[01:58:52.565 --> 01:58:57.226]   If what he is saying does add up, and he's not just like making it up. And by the way, I'm
[01:58:57.226 --> 01:59:00.336]   not saying you are tricks, we just don't know who you are. But let's say hypothetically,
[01:59:00.336 --> 01:59:06.286]   this is true. And hypothetically, this guy isn't making it up. And would this would you have
[01:59:06.286 --> 01:59:13.295]   some kind of source for appeal or something to use this or like, what do you think, Alex?
[01:59:14.096 --> 01:59:18.885]  I just know they attack me on HBO, CNN, ABC, everything.
[01:59:18.885 --> 01:59:20.735]  And they say stop attacking.
[01:59:20.943 --> 01:59:21.803]  We're not even talking about them.
[01:59:22.783 --> 01:59:26.205]  And so, I understand this is a larger operation.
[01:59:26.885 --> 01:59:27.666]  And so, I don't know.
[01:59:27.686 --> 01:59:29.446]  I barely ever talked about it.
[01:59:31.267 --> 01:59:34.589]  I know about court, how they use somebody in the state to actually have jurisdiction.
[01:59:34.609 --> 01:59:36.169]  I don't know if this guy is real.
[01:59:36.710 --> 01:59:39.431]  But all I know is, it just goes on and on and on.
[01:59:39.831 --> 01:59:42.092]  I'm on every TV channel everywhere about these people.
[01:59:42.112 --> 01:59:43.412]  I barely ever talked about them.
[01:59:44.053 --> 01:59:45.613]  And so, I appreciate this long discussion.
[01:59:45.633 --> 01:59:47.054]  And I love you guys.
[01:59:47.754 --> 01:59:49.015]  I'm gonna go spend time with my family.
[01:59:49.522 --> 01:59:50.122]  But I don't know.
[01:59:50.162 --> 01:59:51.483]  We should continue to investigate this.
[01:59:51.883 --> 01:59:52.843]  And I appreciate you all.
[01:59:53.223 --> 01:59:55.464]  Please follow me at RealAlexJones on Instagram.
[01:59:55.484 --> 01:59:56.124]  I appreciate everybody.
[01:59:57.024 --> 01:59:57.945]  Appreciate Alex.
[01:59:57.985 --> 02:00:06.487]  Thank you for taking your time out to come on the space and answer a number of questions both for and against you.
[02:00:06.527 --> 02:00:08.828]  We did have a number of questions from both sides.
[02:00:09.721 --> 02:00:29.297]  I think we gave the space some justice because, and that's what makes it different, because there has been spaces, Alex has been spaces himself on this, but what we did different was we provided a conversation from both sides, debate from both sides, and I think there was a lot of tough questions asked to Alex, and there was a lot of people who also defended Alex's position and provided the other side.
[02:00:30.298 --> 02:00:36.182]  We are going to be wrapping up the space now, unless, yeah, we are going to be wrapping up the space now.
[02:00:36.703 --> 02:00:39.445]  Any last comments before we wrap up, Sarah?
[02:00:42.461 --> 02:00:43.902]  Other than Suleiman, you did an awesome job.
[02:00:44.622 --> 02:00:45.463]  Yes, of course.
[02:00:45.523 --> 02:00:47.684]  That doesn't even need to be said.
[02:00:48.884 --> 02:00:49.425]  Can you hear me?
[02:00:50.085 --> 02:00:51.085]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:00:51.145 --> 02:00:52.406]  The world can hear your accurate statement.
[02:00:53.444 --> 02:00:54.225]  Thank you, thank you.
[02:00:54.985 --> 02:00:57.206]  No, I thought it was a good conversation.
[02:00:57.706 --> 02:01:02.989]  Reading the comments, you know, Alex Jones, you either love him or hate him.
[02:01:03.089 --> 02:01:04.250]  There is no in-between.
[02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:11.133]  I've not met one person that says, oh, Alex Jones, oh, I don't really know about him or their feelings about him.
[02:01:11.633 --> 02:01:14.555]  I thought it was a good and balanced discussion.
[02:01:14.715 --> 02:01:21.518]  If anything, there were more against than were for Alex Jones.
[02:01:22.884 --> 02:01:26.247]  You know, that sort of warmed my heart a little bit, I won't lie.
[02:01:27.348 --> 02:01:28.869]  But thank you, Silly Mom.
[02:01:28.889 --> 02:01:31.731]  Thank you for an excellent job, and I'll send it back to you.
[02:01:33.853 --> 02:01:34.754]  Thank you for that, Sarah.
[02:01:34.774 --> 02:01:36.475]  I appreciate you guys.
[02:01:36.495 --> 02:01:37.276]  I think it was really good.
[02:01:37.316 --> 02:01:40.518]  I think we got a lot of information, a lot of people pushed back.
[02:01:40.578 --> 02:01:42.820]  Then at the same time, a lot of people also defended.
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:44.281]  I appreciate you guys joining in.
[02:01:44.301 --> 02:01:46.023]  I appreciate you guys listening.
[02:01:46.503 --> 02:01:48.545]  I'm for sure we will see you next time.
