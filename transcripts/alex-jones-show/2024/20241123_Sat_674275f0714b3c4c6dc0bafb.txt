[00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.950]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.710]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the Infowars.
[00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:30.210]  It's Saturday, November 23rd, 2024. I come to you from the embattled Infowars studios in Austin, Texas with major news.
[00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:34.570]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.390]  My fellow Paul Revere's in the United States and across the world, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.350]  It is 4.03, 52 seconds.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:09.560]  Central Standard Time we are transmitting worldwide from the Infoware studios in Austin, Texas, recently recaptured from the Justice Department nine days ago.
[00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:27.620]  That is just emblematic of the battle in the information war to restore our republic, to stop the globalists, and to end what has already begun World War III and the mad rush or stampede into full thermonuclear war.
[00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.569]  I have massive World War III breaking news and analysis you will not get anywhere else.
[00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.030]  Tomorrow's news today, literally.
[00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:46.590]  And then I will cover all the rest of the critical news because every day and every moment is precious.
[00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:59.269]  The Great Awakening is here, but the forces of evil and monopoly and tyranny and corruption, the forces of the death cult, Are striking back, but humanity is rising.
[00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.930]  All right.
[00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:04.629]  First off, the World War III developments.
[00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:08.509]  Then all the other big news that ties into that.
[00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.370]  Remember, this is not a spectator sport.
[00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.250]  This is not entertainment.
[00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.169]  This is not Gladiator II that comes out tomorrow.
[00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.389]  This is the real world.
[00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.889]  And...
[00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.469]  We need every man, woman, and child that is awake to be waking others up.
[00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:41.770]  So now, whether you're listening on radio or watching on TV or watching at Real Alex Jones on X, take the feed, take the channel, take the link you're listening to, and share it on your email, your text message, by word of mouth, with your family, your friends, your neighbors, and perfect strangers.
[00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:57.389]  And when they see the information, tell them, if this is helpful to you, if you find this to be informative, If you find this to be thought-provoking and compelling as it is, there's nothing more powerful than reality.
[00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.949]  And nothing succeeds like success as humanity awakens.
[00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.069]  Then tell them to share it as well.
[00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.849]  And tell those they give it to to share it.
[00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.849]  And those they give it to to share it.
[00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.710]  And those they give it to to share it.
[00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.629]  And that completes the chain reaction.
[00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.550]  You are the ones that have the power right now.
[00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.020]  To trigger the chain reaction.
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:35.039]  We've had days in the last three weeks where on X alone, on the Alex Jones channel alone, at Real Alex Jones, we have reached more than 200 million people in one day.
[00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:45.400]  And that is only possible because of Elon Musk buying Twitter and turning it into X. And then the ingredient you, the public, taking action.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.919]  And of course us in the trenches doing the hard research with all the top expert guests exposing the globalist agenda.
[00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.400]  You add those ingredients together and we hold victory in our hands.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.659]  Show.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.460]  The only way the evil...
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.620]  System can triumph is that good men and women do nothing, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.599]  We are here doing something.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:19.000]  So I say again, share the live feed of this transmission and later the archives and clips from RealAlexJones and FullWars.com.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.579]  Like your very future depends on it, because it does.
[00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:31.420]  All right, let me recap what's happened in the last week, and then I'll get into the new massive breaking news.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.079]  I told you months ago, hundreds of times, the clips have already been played on Friday.
[00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:39.060]  It's on record.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.199]  If you're a new viewer, just look it up.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:58.579]  Alex Jones predicts that when President Trump wins the election in a landslide during the 76-day period when he is president-elect, that the regime, the globalists, the New World Order coup that installed Harris as the nominee without one vote would try to continue their coup by launching,
[00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:01.879]  attack them, storm a shadow, and other states.
[00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.209]  We're good to go.
[00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:22.149]  We're good to go.
[00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:36.889]  That I expected that Trump would be in emergency meetings with world leaders trying to stop this, knowing his past MO, modus operandi.
[00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:50.129]  And then I began to make calls on Tuesday and Wednesday and confirmed that Trump was having basically an emergency peace summit inside Mar-a-Lago.
[00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:12.180]  Then I told you Thursday that the word was that he was going to be meeting with Zelensky, telephonically, Putin, Keir Starmer, Macron, others, and Republican leaders, as well as many in person, and that he was in contact with NATO,
[00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:12.959]  according to my sources.
[00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.639]  I did not know until I woke up at 5 a.m.
[00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:25.279]  Friday morning that the head of NATO, the Secretary General, Rutt, the former leader of the Netherlands, was actually already in Florida.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.980]  He did meet with Trump.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.379]  Sources told me he was already there at Showtime.
[00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:34.699]  That was later hours later confirmed that he'd been there all day.
[00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:42.620]  And that indeed Trump was engaged in an emergency peace summit trying to get an immediate ceasefire.
[00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:45.100]  But Zelensky would not offer one.
[00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:49.199]  And that Putin, Trump is asking Putin to offer one.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.160]  Putin came out in the news and said, I'm ready to offer a ceasefire.
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.839]  But I'll only talk to Trump waiting for Trump to go public.
[00:06:58.839 --> 00:06:59.920]  That's massive news.
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:17.819]  I also, Thursday, before it even broke, said clearly the ICBM hypersonic missile test hitting a major Ukrainian weapons factory complex was a test of a nuclear delivery system with conventional weapons to A,
[00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:23.220]  show they could evade the anti-ballistic missile defense systems and could deliver MIRV payloads.
[00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:34.629]  Meaning multiple re-entry weapon delivery devices simulating a nuclear attack on NATO and letting NATO know that they're in check.
[00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.949]  Not checkmate because there's a nuclear war where we're all in checkmate and everybody dies.
[00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:40.490]  But they're in check.
[00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.189]  Or stalemate, basically.
[00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:43.490]  So...
[00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:46.250]  Or not, basically, that's what it is.
[00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:49.209]  So, that's why it's called mutually assured destruction.
[00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:50.250]  You'd have to be mad to do it.
[00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:50.850]  Everybody dies.
[00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.790]  Mad.
[00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:57.569]  So, that's the latest up until this morning.
[00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:11.509]  Then, this morning, when I got up at 5 a.m., actually, when I went to bed at midnight, I learned and then got up and learned more.
[00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:14.029]  We'll do an overhead shot and I'll show these documents.
[00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:34.090]  A new European alliance was formed yesterday, and we'll go over the official government announcements and documents in a moment, announcing that a large group of European countries don't care even what Trump does,
[00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:42.909]  or if he gets NATO to do a peace deal, that they are going to continue on with war.
[00:08:44.409 --> 00:08:47.809]  It's called the Northern Group Ukraine Alliance.
[00:08:49.029 --> 00:09:05.049]  And they've put out press releases through several major governments led by Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland, and Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, as well as Germany,
[00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:06.789]  the Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom.
[00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:17.009]  And yesterday was their first day while The head of NATO, Secretary General Root, was meeting with Trump.
[00:09:18.429 --> 00:09:25.549]  They were meeting and said, we want heavy weapons, we want even more powerful missiles, we want jets, we want more tanks, and we're never going to give up.
[00:09:25.809 --> 00:09:28.289]  That's what Zelensky said earlier in the week on Monday.
[00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.929]  He said, I don't care if America stops funding me, we're going to continue fighting.
[00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.830]  Well, the U.S. is funding over 80% of it, so that's really hard to believe.
[00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.690]  Here's a photo.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:48.399]  Released by the group meeting yesterday while Trump was meeting with the head of NATO, promising that the war will continue on.
[00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:55.559]  And that's the new EU plan, they've said, is to have a 20- or 30-year war, and that will be the new economy.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.500]  Here's the government offices of Sweden, a press release.
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.200]  Declaration from the defense ministers of northern groups.
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.860]  So it's now called the Northern Group.
[00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:11.299]  And they say that they are going to continue their support for Ukraine no matter what even NATO says.
[00:10:12.299 --> 00:10:14.080]  This is all posted on my X account.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.679]  It trended at the top of X as well today.
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.460]  Not hard for you to find if you want to go look at it.
[00:10:19.539 --> 00:10:22.860]  But here we are breaking Trump's Mar-a-Lago Summit peace talks.
[00:10:23.419 --> 00:10:37.210]  That trended at the top of X. I have several clips, and then I'm going to go over what this means and what the different scenarios are and what the globalists might do to derail peace deals in the next.
[00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.210]  Wait, we'll put it on screen.
[00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.990]  How many days until Trump is sworn in on January 20th, 2025?
[00:10:43.049 --> 00:10:44.649]  Is it 55 days?
[00:10:44.649 --> 00:10:45.269]  I forget.
[00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.549]  Let's put that on screen for everybody.
[00:10:47.669 --> 00:10:48.690]  57 days.
[00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.509]  Wow, I'm cutting a few off.
[00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:51.730]  Really, really hoping for that number.
[00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.190]  57 days, 18 hours, 46 minutes, 10 seconds.
[00:10:57.399 --> 00:11:00.059]  So there's another chilling video that just came out.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:10.899]  Biden got back from Brazil, where he's been wandering around the rainforest, literally not knowing who he is, and was asked by a reporter about the crises happening.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.860]  Reporter, Mr. President, what do you say to Vladimir Putin?
[00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:15.360]  Threat of war.
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:19.200]  Biden, I say you be quiet until I speak, okay?
[00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:23.879]  And boy, I tell you, the cartoonists are having a heyday with this.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.820]  With Joe Biden, hey Donald, I'm going to leave you a gift in the Oval Office.
[00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:32.220]  You'll get a bang out of it.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.360]  And then of course Joe Rogan has responded to this.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:41.279]  This is a trend at the top of X. And of course he just lays out common sense facts.
[00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:46.960]  Let's go ahead and go to President Biden.
[00:11:51.379 --> 00:11:53.620]  I say to you, be quiet until I speak, okay?
[00:11:54.379 --> 00:11:55.159]  That's what I say.
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.059]  Good idea?
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.419]  What do you say to Vladimir Putin's threat of war, sir?
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.259]  It's a serious threat.
[00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:01.419]  You got to be quiet.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.779]  I'm going to make a statement here, okay?
[00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:05.139]  All right.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.639]  Anyway, Mr. Prime Minister, welcome.
[00:12:08.139 --> 00:12:09.779]  Welcome back to the White House.
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:16.080]  Often said, there's no issue of global consequence for the United States and the Great Britain can't work together and haven't worked together.
[00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:18.669]  All right, that's enough.
[00:12:19.309 --> 00:12:32.710]  Now, let's go ahead, as I mentioned, and go to the Joe Rogan sensible, common sense, anti-megalomaniac statement, and then I'll detail, in my view, where we are and the different developments that could unfold.
[00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:41.649]  Again, the future is not determined yet, so I can't predict it exactly, but I can definitely lay out the different scenarios and where I think this is going currently.
[00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:46.490]  And that's what people tune in for, I know, so I'll be getting to that in a moment.
[00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:50.049]  But yes, Russia is conducting nuclear war drills.
[00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:52.090]  Germany's preparing their public.
[00:12:52.289 --> 00:12:53.950]  Sweden, the UK, all of them.
[00:12:54.049 --> 00:12:54.669]  We'll put that back on screen.
[00:12:54.789 --> 00:12:55.429]  That's important you found.
[00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:01.970]  Russia conducts nuclear drills as Joe Biden and NATO ramp up threats of long-range missile strikes on Russian homeland.
[00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:10.990]  Yeah, they're saying they're going to bombard with not dozens a day, but maybe hundreds a day until they get the escalation they want.
[00:13:11.289 --> 00:13:12.629]  Kind of a big deal.
[00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:22.710]  And you'd think that it wouldn't be Infowars two days ago breaking if there's a secret emergency peace summit going on at Mar-a-Lago.
[00:13:24.289 --> 00:13:27.210]  And then the corporate media is silent on it.
[00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:40.409]  Even though it's admitted that, as I told you two days ago, and now it was confirmed yesterday, Rutt was there to talk about global security and Trump's plans for peace in the Ukraine-Russia war.
[00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:41.789]  I mean, that's what it is.
[00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:42.950]  I don't even need sources, though.
[00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.509]  I called and said, well, of course he's doing that.
[00:13:45.309 --> 00:13:46.789]  I said, why is it Trump making statements?
[00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.389]  Is he having a big peace deal?
[00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:49.909]  And he goes, yeah, he's spending most of his time on it.
[00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:50.850]  You know that, Alex.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.519]  And there's the headline.
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.539]  Yeah, Trump and this new European coalition are...
[00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:03.860]  Let's put that back on screen.
[00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:05.659]  Are having issues over this.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.980]  Trump and European coalition in tension over Ukraine peace talks.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.039]  Yeah, how dare...
[00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:14.059]  The president-elect will be doing this.
[00:14:14.159 --> 00:14:16.519]  That trend at the top of X yesterday and today.
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:22.120]  Our five videos on the subject got 75 million views as of this morning.
[00:14:22.259 --> 00:14:36.519]  I haven't looked at it yet, so I want to thank everybody there at X sharing that, understanding how important this is for all of our futures, and Elon Musk not censoring us, just getting out of the way of citizen journalism and analysis.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:43.350]  But when I first said two days ago Trump is in an emergency summit, People are like, oh yeah, alright, how do you know that?
[00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:50.009]  Well, I mean, I know Trump's past behavior, I know he's tried to have other pistols before, and then I made phone calls and confirmed it was going on.
[00:14:51.049 --> 00:14:55.549]  And that's why he hasn't made announcements yet, because he's in the middle of negotiations and wants a big announcement.
[00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.570]  He's trying to get Zelensky and Putin to come out, either or or both.
[00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:08.139]  And say they propose a ceasefire until Trump gets in, in 57 days, and then a deal can be made.
[00:15:08.139 --> 00:15:09.580]  And now that's confirmed.
[00:15:09.759 --> 00:15:12.000]  And the head of NATO was there yesterday, all day long.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.440]  So, you'd think this would be the top story, but it's not.
[00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:22.299]  And that's why we're in so much trouble.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.779]  Here is a brief clip of Joe Rogan talking about where we are.
[00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:34.440]  The world we're living in now, and that's LA, and that's New York, and that's a lot of places that got f***ed up by incompetent people.
[00:15:34.539 --> 00:15:36.840]  I don't know, I just feel safer knowing like...
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.559]  Oh, I feel safer Knowing that Trump is in office.
[00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:42.120]  I do too.
[00:15:42.299 --> 00:15:43.519]  I feel great about it.
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.539]  What I don't feel safer is right now they're launching missiles into Russia.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.179]  How are you allowed to do that when you're on the way out?
[00:15:51.299 --> 00:15:52.720]  The people don't want you to be there anymore.
[00:15:52.779 --> 00:16:05.000]  This should be some sort of a pause for significant actions that could potentially start World War III. Maybe that would be a good thing that we would like to avoid from a dying former president.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:05.580]  Mm-hmm.
[00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:08.000]  The whole thing is nuts.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.440]  I mean, look, I don't know s*** about politics.
[00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:12.240]  Zelensky says Putin is terrified.
[00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:14.460]  F*** you, man.
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.320]  F*** you people.
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.500]  You f***ing people are about to start World War III. Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.340]  Russia fired a missile today.
[00:16:22.539 --> 00:16:26.059]  Yeah, they fired an intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time ever.
[00:16:26.259 --> 00:16:28.080]  It's the first time one of those has ever been used.
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:29.580]  That's insanity.
[00:16:29.799 --> 00:16:33.600]  F***ing insanity, because those intercontinental ballistic missiles can have nukes on them.
[00:16:33.679 --> 00:16:50.179]  This one didn't, but if it does, the whole world changes, and it changes because of the military-industrial complex, and it changes because of the money that's going to Ukraine, and it changes because the outgoing president, or whoever the f*** is actually running the country, has decided to do something f***ing insane.
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.840]  F***ing insane.
[00:16:52.649 --> 00:16:55.929]  And we're all sitting there watching it, and people are cheering it on.
[00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.450]  CNN was saying, like, finally.
[00:16:58.789 --> 00:17:06.230]  See what their headline was about Zelensky using, about Biden giving Zelensky the ability to use long-range missiles.
[00:17:06.529 --> 00:17:08.329]  U.S. made long-range.
[00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.349]  It's not like nobody knows where they came from.
[00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.369]  It's not like nobody knows we've been funding this.
[00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:13.450]  It's a proxy war.
[00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:15.329]  The whole thing is f***ing insane.
[00:17:16.009 --> 00:17:16.910]  It's insane.
[00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.769]  Come to the negotiation table.
[00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:20.329]  Sit down.
[00:17:20.529 --> 00:17:21.109]  Work this out.
[00:17:21.269 --> 00:17:22.130]  Stop killing everybody.
[00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:24.710]  U.S. allows Ukraine to use long-range missiles.
[00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.410]  So what did they say?
[00:17:28.049 --> 00:17:34.470]  Someone had said that, like, CNN was saying that it was a good thing, which I think is, how?
[00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:41.029]  How has the left gone so far crazy that they think it's a good thing to launch missiles?
[00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.970]  That's what's scary about life is like you don't want to pay attention to that sh**.
[00:17:47.049 --> 00:17:48.369]  You just want to live your life.
[00:17:48.609 --> 00:17:55.029]  You want to just be carefree and have fun and do the thing that you're passionate about and meanwhile the world is burning.
[00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:56.930]  You can't do anything about it.
[00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.390]  At that high level it's like there's nothing...
[00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.009]  Well we can.
[00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:04.849]  We voted Trump in and his idea is to stop all this sh** and hopefully he can do that.
[00:18:05.309 --> 00:18:05.410]  Yeah.
[00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:07.150]  But you know, man.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.140]  We got 60 more days until Trump gets in, or whatever it is.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.180]  How many days is it, Jamie?
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.079]  But who knows?
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.000]  Maybe once it gets in, they'll ramp it up.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:19.779]  Who knows?
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.640]  Maybe they'll sabotage his administration.
[00:18:22.259 --> 00:18:23.339]  That's what's even more scary.
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.380]  People don't want him in power.
[00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:28.279]  And the people that are in power don't want to leave power, and they'll try every way they can to keep it.
[00:18:28.539 --> 00:18:29.700]  60 days from today.
[00:18:31.539 --> 00:18:31.980]  All right.
[00:18:32.099 --> 00:18:32.700]  On the news.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:33.559]  60 days.
[00:18:33.859 --> 00:18:34.619]  Keep your fingers crossed.
[00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:34.980]  Yeah.
[00:18:35.319 --> 00:18:38.119]  Just hope Putin understands what's going on as well.
[00:18:38.339 --> 00:18:39.759]  And Zelensky doesn't do anything stupid.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.319]  But saying that Putin's terrified.
[00:18:42.839 --> 00:18:48.039]  It's like you're trying to like tug the tail of a fucking sleeping dragon.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:48.880]  Dragons.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.299]  Dragons.
[00:18:50.299 --> 00:18:50.519]  Yeah.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.720]  Also, Zelensky, can I get a drug test?
[00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:01.470]  And Joe starts the conversation with, look how the Democrats are incompetent and have ruined all our cities.
[00:19:01.569 --> 00:19:02.450]  No, they've done it on purpose.
[00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:04.769]  They are a death cult.
[00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.890]  They are anti-human.
[00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:07.109]  They are scum.
[00:19:08.369 --> 00:19:12.930]  So, let's play a clip of the Russian foreign minister, Lavrov.
[00:19:13.289 --> 00:19:17.930]  It's got English subtitles, but for radio stations, I'll do my best to read the subtitles.
[00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:25.670]  But he says exactly what Trump and I've said, and this is the bare minimum they're trying to hand Trump a disaster when he gets in in 57 days.
[00:19:25.769 --> 00:19:26.150]  Here it is.
[00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:45.470]  As to what we can expect from Biden and his outgoing administration, well, the deliveries of ATAKAMS missiles and the way they allowed the British and the French to use their own missiles,
[00:19:45.829 --> 00:19:58.460]  well, this is In a way, an attempt to leave as bad a legacy as possible to the next administration.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.559]  Yeah, that's exactly what's going on, bare minimum.
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:13.839]  So, we didn't know the name of this new hypersonic intermediate-range or medium-range missile, because they hadn't said the name.
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.079]  Now Russia's released the name.
[00:20:15.079 --> 00:20:18.880]  It's the Orshank, if I'm saying that right.
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.960]  I guess the name of a tree in Russia.
[00:20:21.619 --> 00:20:23.380]  And it goes on, what we know.
[00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:25.299]  Do an overhead shot, please.
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.960]  And they reportedly have thousands of these things.
[00:20:30.519 --> 00:20:31.720]  So there you go.
[00:20:31.779 --> 00:20:33.359]  They can load nukes on them all day long.
[00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:38.279]  It was all a nuclear demonstration that they can strike any target they want, that the missile defense systems can't stop it.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:47.200]  Key European NATO bases in reach of Russia's Orshank hypersonic missiles.
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.779]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.119]  So, look.
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.259]  You gotta think like the globalists who blew up the North Stream pipeline and blamed Putin.
[00:21:03.529 --> 00:21:15.450]  Zelensky's already been caught two years ago firing missiles into Poland and claiming Russia did it, but the Poles were able to shoot them down, and so they didn't explode properly, so they got the tail numbers on them, and they were Ukrainian.
[00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:20.210]  Zelensky came out immediately and said, attack Russia and NATO. They've attacked a NATO country.
[00:21:20.349 --> 00:21:23.730]  Attack, attack, attack, trying to start World War III. Totally insane.
[00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.650]  And...
[00:21:26.819 --> 00:21:30.180]  Even after he got caught for weeks, he still said, bomb, bomb, attack, attack.
[00:21:30.839 --> 00:21:38.200]  They've been caught and had to admit later that they've attacked several of the nuclear reactors that Russia controls that are in eastern Ukraine and tried to blame Russia for it.
[00:21:38.259 --> 00:21:40.299]  Why would Russia attack nuclear reactors they're in control of?
[00:21:40.779 --> 00:21:43.299]  By the way, they've kept them fired up supplying energy.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:22:02.839]  They caught shooting them with missiles and shooting them with artillery but they've got giant containment domes on them so they damaged the domes and caused some fires but didn't make the reactors melt down so they can then use that incident in New Chernobyl or Fukushima level event to then blame Russia.
[00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.250]  Those are major insane provocations.
[00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.809]  And last week, Zelensky's like, yes, we had the missiles.
[00:22:10.009 --> 00:22:13.529]  We're going to start hitting Russia with it, and they will speak for themselves.
[00:22:13.809 --> 00:22:18.430]  And now he's like, we want hundreds of missiles, and we have hundreds of missiles, and we're going to get him.
[00:22:18.529 --> 00:22:22.890]  And then his top general said on Friday, World War III has begun.
[00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:27.849]  As I told you on Wednesday, they would soon announce World War III has begun.
[00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:29.529]  World War III has begun.
[00:22:29.529 --> 00:22:31.490]  You must join us in full war now.
[00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:32.289]  It is wonderful.
[00:22:32.289 --> 00:22:32.990]  Oh, yes.
[00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:36.710]  So, how do I know this stuff?
[00:22:36.769 --> 00:22:37.569]  How do I keep calling it?
[00:22:38.089 --> 00:22:42.609]  Putin's going to come out and say that he's tested an ICBM that can deliver nukes and it can get past your defenses.
[00:22:42.829 --> 00:22:43.690]  That's easy.
[00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.069]  No one else was saying it.
[00:22:46.069 --> 00:22:48.369]  Why are they firing an ICBM? What was that about?
[00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.529]  I didn't have nukes on it.
[00:22:49.609 --> 00:22:50.750]  I mean, just come on, people.
[00:22:52.009 --> 00:22:53.430]  This is fascinating stuff.
[00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.109]  I've been studying it for over 35 years.
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.819]  And that's how I know what's going on.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:12.339]  And I can tell you that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and the Republican leaders, like the Speaker of the House, do not know all this stuff.
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.759]  And most of them are on drugs and out of their minds.
[00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:19.470]  And then the Pentagon's running around saying, Putin is bluffing.
[00:23:19.609 --> 00:23:22.630]  If we keep attacking him inside Russia, he won't do anything.
[00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:27.289]  Kind of like, we'll just push troops all the way up to their border in Ukraine, and he won't do anything.
[00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:35.269]  And then, of course, we've got Sean Penn saying we need to use nuclear weapons, and we can't be intimidated to use them.
[00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:38.970]  I mean, he's reading off a NATO globalist script.
[00:23:40.089 --> 00:23:41.309]  And here's the problem.
[00:23:42.509 --> 00:23:46.109]  The Russians, for the last 30 years, did back down until three years ago.
[00:23:46.309 --> 00:23:52.609]  Well, they went into southern Ukraine six, seven years ago and took over that part of the country.
[00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:56.690]  So I guess he stopped bluffing when they took over Crimea.
[00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:57.430]  When did they take over Crimea?
[00:23:57.529 --> 00:23:58.210]  Was it seven years ago?
[00:23:58.289 --> 00:23:59.450]  Guys, look up when Russia took over Crimea.
[00:24:00.069 --> 00:24:01.430]  Was it 2014?
[00:24:03.009 --> 00:24:03.950]  2014. Okay.
[00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:06.650]  Well, let's pull that up and double-check the memory.
[00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:17.369]  But the point is that he stopped bluffing then, And then three years ago, it'll be three years in February, so almost three years ago, he really stopped bluffing.
[00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:20.569]  And now the bluff, I mean, it's not been bluffing.
[00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:21.869]  He's like, don't cross the red line.
[00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.569]  Okay, don't cross the red line again.
[00:24:24.569 --> 00:24:26.589]  All right, don't cross it again.
[00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:31.789]  And he's now cornered, as Glenn Beck said earlier in the week.
[00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:41.250]  Yeah, February and March 2014. Just like he invaded on February 20th, three years ago.
[00:24:42.089 --> 00:24:46.809]  Because that's about a month before things start warming back up, two months before, so the tanks can get in there.
[00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:48.569]  And that's the time to invade in the winter.
[00:24:50.609 --> 00:24:53.670]  So, at the end of the winter, or close to the end of the winter.
[00:24:54.569 --> 00:24:58.549]  So, we're coming up on another big phase of the invasion.
[00:24:58.769 --> 00:25:01.369]  And I can guarantee you, Russia's thinking about it.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.660]  They don't want to take the whole country.
[00:25:03.759 --> 00:25:04.579]  They don't need more land.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.680]  They just want a buffer zone.
[00:25:06.099 --> 00:25:07.859]  Putin is on record like Trump.
[00:25:08.019 --> 00:25:11.740]  What he says is what he does because he wants that credibility of other leaders.
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.480]  That's how Trump get all these deals done.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:23.950]  All these foreign leaders go, listen, with Reagan or Nixon particularly, we can make deals with people And they would follow them.
[00:25:24.069 --> 00:25:27.490]  We may not even like the deal, but we need to know a deal's a deal.
[00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:33.150]  And just since then, with the Clintons and then Obama and the rest of it, a deal's not a deal.
[00:25:34.309 --> 00:25:39.329]  So the United States is losing its soft power around the world and losing its military power as well.
[00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:40.690]  They're running down the dollar.
[00:25:40.869 --> 00:25:48.890]  All this is happening because we have an incompetent Globalist elite that's in control.
[00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:53.390]  So I kind of gave you some examples of false flags that have already launched and got caught in Ukraine.
[00:25:55.009 --> 00:26:03.750]  And I would expect, like I said, that they're going to develop a coalition against Trump's initiative to have peace.
[00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.730]  Congress has already done a bunch of funding.
[00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.869]  They say bypasses Trump even once he gets in.
[00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.670]  Front-loading the war for at least another year.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:18.819]  But a nuclear false flag, an attack on a nuclear power plant, firing missiles into Poland or some other NATO country again.
[00:26:18.819 --> 00:26:19.819]  They've already done that.
[00:26:20.019 --> 00:26:22.779]  And past behavior is the most indicative of future behavior.
[00:26:24.319 --> 00:26:39.079]  So we now have this, see, I will put it back up, this new Nordic Northern group, new Nordic group Ukraine alliance has emerged, which will include countries in Scandinavia, Baltic states, Northern Europe, and the UK. So...
[00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:41.609]  They're there countering that.
[00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:49.910]  Even if Trump threatens to cut back funding to NATO, if they don't, and NATO backs off, NATO will just go to these proxies.
[00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:55.789]  And that's why Zelensky's pledging to never give up, because he's put in there to do this.
[00:26:56.049 --> 00:26:56.829]  He's an actor.
[00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:00.609]  So...
[00:27:00.609 --> 00:27:05.890]  The establishment's already said they're going to ignore Trump.
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.079]  And one way or another, try to keep this going.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.019]  But Ukraine's already lost the war.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.599]  The Russians have achieved their objective.
[00:27:12.319 --> 00:27:14.799]  So what do you need to keep it going?
[00:27:15.019 --> 00:27:17.480]  Well, you start bombing Russia to get them to respond.
[00:27:17.779 --> 00:27:20.240]  So you can escalate there, even if Russia doesn't respond.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.000]  And here's the key.
[00:27:22.099 --> 00:27:28.960]  If Russia lets this red line be passed, which they really haven't with this ICBM test, but that's just the first warning.
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.339]  Putin said more is coming.
[00:27:30.519 --> 00:27:33.480]  He said, regardless, even if you don't escalate, we're not done.
[00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:35.799]  Demonstrating things to you.
[00:27:36.039 --> 00:27:36.779]  But don't worry.
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.519]  We'll tell civilian areas we're about to hit.
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.700]  We'll give you, you know, some time to get out.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.740]  He said that Thursday.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.119]  15 minutes before I said, Putin will come out and say this.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.319]  Word for word.
[00:27:50.119 --> 00:27:50.980]  Not talking to Putin.
[00:27:51.079 --> 00:27:51.920]  Not talking to the Russians.
[00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:55.089]  He goes live 15 minutes after I say it.
[00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:57.630]  Everybody was like, people are freaking out about that.
[00:27:57.829 --> 00:28:05.849]  Folks, I got buddies that played football in college and all that in the NFL. You get around them and they're talking to their other buddies.
[00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:09.809]  I can't go out to dinner with them or drinking with them like I used to years ago because...
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.400]  All they'll do is talk about sports stats all day, and they know every complexity.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.980]  Men have brains, so do women, to be able to know all this stuff.
[00:28:19.099 --> 00:28:25.640]  See, I know about geopolitics, different regions, the different militaries, the different weapon systems, the different doctrines.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:29.859]  I don't know about the NFL or the NBA or any of that.
[00:28:30.099 --> 00:28:31.400]  I don't know about the Olympics.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.240]  I don't know about Netflix shows.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.779]  I don't know about actors.
[00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:36.079]  I don't care.
[00:28:37.059 --> 00:28:38.440]  It just doesn't matter to me.
[00:28:38.539 --> 00:28:45.279]  I know about stuff that matters like energy policy, border policy, social policy, monetary policy, military policy.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.500]  And I'm not trying to like, oh, you know, I'm saying this is what I do.
[00:28:50.579 --> 00:28:52.380]  And so I know what I'm talking about.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:29:03.009]  And so when I tell you that We are absolutely on the fast track very soon to full war with Russia.
[00:29:03.009 --> 00:29:09.789]  We're already in the first stages of World War III. And the question is, will it go to its final stage of total nuclear war and the end of civilization as we know at bare minimum?
[00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:18.049]  And so the very danger of this, and I'm someone that studies this, and I'm a realist.
[00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:18.910]  I've been through a lot.
[00:29:19.769 --> 00:29:24.369]  I'm not untrained in the school of the real world.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.500]  Extremely street smart.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.200]  I have trouble facing this as well.
[00:29:31.359 --> 00:29:34.119]  I have trouble going, because I'm looking at it.
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:38.019]  I look at all the main analysts and the Rand Corporation, the think tanks, the Pentagon, the war games.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.880]  You know, what's in the public war game stuff and the congressional reports?
[00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:42.819]  And they're like, yeah, this will probably be a nuclear war.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.420]  And they've been advising Biden to stop.
[00:29:45.579 --> 00:29:46.539]  Whoever controls him.
[00:29:47.059 --> 00:29:48.859]  The cardigan down and all of them.
[00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:53.529]  And they're all saying this is going to lead to nuclear war if it continues.
[00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:55.309]  Henry Kissinger said it two years ago.
[00:29:56.109 --> 00:29:57.609]  He's like their kingpin.
[00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:58.750]  He's their poobah.
[00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:02.630]  He got so attacked, he backed off and said, okay, fine, continue the war.
[00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:05.490]  Yeah, yeah, let's show the, what's Xi Jinping saying?
[00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:05.950]  I missed that.
[00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:11.289]  So, China rises as a global leader.
[00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:12.950]  Xi lays out red lines.
[00:30:13.049 --> 00:30:13.569]  Print me that.
[00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.069]  I'm sure he says if you see, everybody's letting their red lines out.
[00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:18.890]  I haven't read it yet, but it'll be this.
[00:30:19.069 --> 00:30:23.410]  If you keep giving arms to Taiwan, we'll attack you in the South China Sea.
[00:30:24.309 --> 00:30:30.289]  If you get involved and try to block any of our rarest mineral mining operations around the world, we'll attack you.
[00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:36.549]  If you officially recognize Taiwan, we'll invade Taiwan.
[00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:39.529]  If you attack Russia...
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:41.700]  And continue to attack Russia.
[00:30:42.019 --> 00:30:43.859]  We will officially come in on the side of Russia.
[00:30:44.279 --> 00:30:45.440]  I mean, I already know what he's going to say.
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.400]  Because it's the doctrine.
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:49.220]  Print it for me.
[00:30:49.259 --> 00:30:49.680]  Let's see.
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.700]  So I guess that just broke.
[00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:53.160]  I was looking at Drudge 40 minutes ago.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.180]  So that's where we are.
[00:30:58.519 --> 00:31:02.339]  And I understand everybody has a normalcy bias.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:20.299]  So do I. I mean, I got up today, went and hiked seven miles with my oldest daughter at 7 a.m., went home, hung out with my wife and my youngest daughter that still lives with me, seven-year-old, played some board games,
[00:31:20.619 --> 00:31:28.960]  did some watercolors, and then I drove into the office and did more research, and now I'm on air.
[00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:38.640]  And I just want to, you know, go home tonight, eat dinner, hang out, maybe play some pool with my wife, maybe build a fire outside.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.240]  It's a nice, cool night.
[00:31:40.779 --> 00:31:42.720]  Got a little fireplace out on the back porch.
[00:31:44.059 --> 00:31:45.519]  Maybe listen to some music.
[00:31:46.359 --> 00:31:47.599]  And I'll do that.
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:32:03.599]  But while that's going on, I'm going to have in the front of my head, not the back of my mind, The fact that we've never been closer to nuclear war, according to the International Atomic Scientist Group and all the other experts.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.339]  And you go read the reports, it's exactly what I'm telling you.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.079]  Okay?
[00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:08.819]  So I don't need to read the reports.
[00:32:08.819 --> 00:32:10.839]  I don't need to know what Xi Jinping just said.
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.200]  They'll bring it into me, please, as soon as you can.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.740]  To guess what he's saying, and I'm sure I'll be 95% right.
[00:32:18.759 --> 00:32:19.920]  He might have said something a little different.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.039]  Hopefully he didn't say everything I said.
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.960]  That's where this is going.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:26.519]  And...
[00:32:29.769 --> 00:32:45.029]  If we don't realize how much danger we're in and get out of the normalcy bias, and again, the normalcy bias is because your life's been normal, because it's been good, because you've never had something, you've never been robbed, or never been in a bad car wreck, or never had a house fire,
[00:32:45.369 --> 00:32:51.529]  when it happens to people that have never had anything bad happen, a lot of folks just can't even believe it's happening.
[00:32:53.549 --> 00:33:10.839]  I mean, so many people that are 30, 40, 50 years old that have never been the victims of crime, Once they actually get mugged or robbed or raped, and when it happens, they just cannot believe it.
[00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:22.059]  And we've had such a safe civilization per capita on average for so long that, you know, here in America, a lot of the world is really bad.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.640]  Like, people think America's bad, they travel the world, they go, God, this place is great.
[00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:30.710]  Yeah, our poorest people have more than, you know, most people that are middle class in other countries.
[00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:37.990]  And so, yeah, and our standard of living's dropped, and we've got big problems, but we're still the best house in a bad neighborhood, unless you're ultra-rich in, like, Switzerland or something.
[00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:45.029]  And there's some other nice places, like in the British countryside and stuff, but those, in the French countryside, that's all being taken by globalists in, you know, the Netherlands.
[00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.029]  And I got articles this week where BBC is like...
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:52.240]  Farmers mainly are white in the Netherlands and England and Ireland.
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:52.960]  They're bad.
[00:33:53.099 --> 00:33:54.319]  We're going to make them sell their property.
[00:33:54.319 --> 00:33:55.539]  We're going to put migrants on it.
[00:33:55.839 --> 00:33:58.660]  And we're going to stop growing food because it's bad for the earth.
[00:33:59.779 --> 00:34:02.200]  We've got to cut food production or people are going to starve.
[00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:03.220]  Actual headline.
[00:34:03.319 --> 00:34:06.000]  You're like, cut food production or people starve.
[00:34:06.579 --> 00:34:08.260]  That's psychological warfare.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.659]  You think you're a new viewer?
[00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:11.300]  You think I'm joking?
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.599]  I can play John Kerry saying it too.
[00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:13.239]  You want to see that?
[00:34:17.079 --> 00:34:17.440]  So...
[00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:25.349]  So, we're dealing with psychotics here.
[00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:27.889]  And they have a normalcy bias, too.
[00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:29.469]  That most of them aren't military.
[00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:30.750]  Most of them haven't studied this.
[00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:33.630]  We know the Pentagon's saying don't do this.
[00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:35.369]  But...
[00:34:35.369 --> 00:34:40.110]  Remember...
[00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:45.530]  10 years ago, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time was not a total globalist.
[00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:49.630]  And he testified to Congress, they go, well, why can't you attack the Russian forces in Syria?
[00:34:51.059 --> 00:35:00.360]  And he goes, well, we can do that, Chairman, but that's World War III. If we attack the Russian air bases, they will attack us, and then we'll be at war with Russia.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:06.380]  And then Turkey says they're going to join in, and Turkey's got nuclear weapons, too.
[00:35:07.019 --> 00:35:08.579]  And the Chairman's like, oh, really?
[00:35:08.739 --> 00:35:09.119]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.579]  Yeah, see, if we attack the Russians, they'll attack us back.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:22.599]  In fact, that's in the promo right before the 2016 election that we put out like five days before.
[00:35:22.739 --> 00:35:25.099]  They got like 100 million views, I think, affected the election.
[00:35:25.619 --> 00:35:28.760]  The one with Leanne McAdoo and Darren McBreen in it that's a simulated nuclear war.
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:33.019]  It's got the real clip of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs staff saying, yeah, we can attack the Russians.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.940]  That's World War III. Remember Biden two years ago?
[00:35:36.059 --> 00:35:43.480]  Yeah, we can give them Abrams tanks and F-16s, but on the threat escalation, that will then go to World War III in the threat doctrine.
[00:35:44.369 --> 00:35:50.429]  If you give them the weapons and they use those weapons, Russia will consider it an attack of NATO and they will start attacking NATO targets.
[00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:55.050]  And now the response is, well, let's just see what they did.
[00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:57.590]  Because he's bluffing.
[00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.429]  No, I'm going to say it again.
[00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:08.050]  In 2014, Putin quit bluffing and took over Crimea because NATO was using it already as a proxy war in Ukraine.
[00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.670]  And that's their basis and has been for 500 years.
[00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:13.789]  Russia started there 1,000 years ago.
[00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:16.070]  So Ukraine is Russia's mama.
[00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:17.489]  It's like its grandma.
[00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:24.730]  So then in 2022, Putin went in.
[00:36:27.769 --> 00:36:30.130]  And that was a big, we're not bluffing.
[00:36:30.449 --> 00:36:36.429]  And now this ICBM just blew up this whole giant base, this giant factory complex, and they dropped.
[00:36:36.809 --> 00:36:47.449]  You saw, and I said this when the video came out, I said, that's MIRV technology, that's an ICBM, and they're showing they can target, and all of it.
[00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:53.070]  And I already saw comments saying, oh, Jones doesn't know what that is.
[00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:55.329]  That's a whole bunch of missiles coming in.
[00:36:55.409 --> 00:36:57.030]  That's not one missile.
[00:36:59.059 --> 00:37:08.000]  And I could look at it and see how they came in and tell you right there, that's coming straight down.
[00:37:09.079 --> 00:37:14.519]  And at the speed it was going at, that was multiple reentry vehicles.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.360]  Okay?
[00:37:16.519 --> 00:37:19.280]  And that's been around in the United States since the 70s.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.840]  And the Russians have had it since the 70s.
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.699]  And the Chinese have had it since the 90s, since Bill Clinton gave it to them.
[00:37:25.489 --> 00:37:26.650]  Laurel and Hughes Corporation.
[00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.809]  Let me explain what MIRV technology is.
[00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:41.550]  There's a lot of stuff, but when a Falcon Heavy or a Starship, the biggest spaceship in the world, it's just gorgeous, that's the biggest ICBM in the world.
[00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:57.250]  But see, Elon Musk isn't sending it up to go over some other country and then dump a bunch of rocket-propelled hydrogen bombs on them that they can target down to a few feet, each one, Yeah,
[00:37:57.349 --> 00:38:00.590]  there's Kerry saying, ban half the farmings or people will starve to death.
[00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.269]  Cut your legs off and slit your throat or you'll bleed to death.
[00:38:03.849 --> 00:38:06.309]  Blow your head off with a shotgun or you might not live.
[00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:12.309]  Take five gallons of gasoline and pour it on yourself and light it or you're going to die.
[00:38:14.269 --> 00:38:16.369]  It's done to just kill common sense.
[00:38:16.489 --> 00:38:17.110]  Two men can have a baby.
[00:38:18.579 --> 00:38:22.619]  See, Elon Musk is all about science, precision, reality, real numbers.
[00:38:22.639 --> 00:38:25.900]  We need to have over two kids apiece, blah, blah, blah, or societal collapse.
[00:38:26.119 --> 00:38:27.800]  With them, it's two men can have a baby.
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.079]  Farming is bad.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.059]  Everyone will starve if we don't cut the farming off.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.719]  You're like, cut the farming off or we'll starve.
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.219]  Organic farming is the worst.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.179]  Ban all of that immediately.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:40.519]  We're going to inject cows with a vaccine so they don't produce methane in their guts.
[00:38:40.639 --> 00:38:44.320]  That's how they break it down into protein.
[00:38:47.519 --> 00:38:52.739]  See, it's all just insane mad scientists at war with the good scientists.
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.719]  And that's the ruling class of the planet.
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:03.059]  So do you have a superbrain scientist that's pro-human, or do you have a bunch of globalist mad scientists that are anti-human?
[00:39:03.199 --> 00:39:04.659]  I'll get to Elon Musk coming up next.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.900]  And Neil deGrasse Tyson and his idiocy about we shouldn't go to Mars.
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:15.619]  Yeah, then Christopher Columbus shouldn't have sent the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria over here either.
[00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:23.050]  And the Wright brothers shouldn't have tried to build an airplane out of bicycle parts in Kitty Hawk either.
[00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.550]  And we shouldn't have built the Panama Canal either.
[00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:29.829]  And we shouldn't have ever broken the sound barrier with Chuck Yeager either.
[00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:32.050]  And I'm going to explain why this is so evil in a moment.
[00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:36.889]  But it's the philosophy of these people versus pro-team humanity philosophy.
[00:39:38.469 --> 00:39:38.949]  So...
[00:39:45.199 --> 00:39:46.099]  Let me get to this.
[00:39:46.219 --> 00:39:47.000]  Business Insider.
[00:39:47.139 --> 00:39:53.960]  Xi was unusually frank in spelling out China's four red lines for the U.S., a clear warning for Trump's China hawks.
[00:39:54.619 --> 00:39:59.860]  China's Xi Jinping was usually candid with U.S. President Biden in their last meeting at their country's leaders.
[00:40:00.159 --> 00:40:04.099]  Xi outlined China's red lines for the U.S., including the country's rights to development.
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.400]  See, I told you they're going to get in the way of our expansion for rarest minerals.
[00:40:08.699 --> 00:40:13.159]  Beijing was setting ground rules for incoming Trump administration and its China hawks.
[00:40:13.579 --> 00:40:20.780]  China's leader Xi Jinping is gearing up for Trump 2.0 with some ground rules for administration China hawks.
[00:40:21.389 --> 00:40:27.030]  Last week she met with President Joe Biden at the 31st AIPAC economic leaders meeting in Peru.
[00:40:27.389 --> 00:40:33.389]  He told Washington not to cross four red lines, which analysts say is a clear message for the incoming front administration.
[00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:34.670]  I guess this is out now.
[00:40:34.829 --> 00:40:35.730]  This is a private meeting.
[00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:42.730]  The four hot-button issues are Taiwan, democracy, human rights, China's path and system, and the country's rights to development.
[00:40:42.889 --> 00:40:43.690]  So it's exactly what I said.
[00:40:44.099 --> 00:40:52.460]  These are the most important guardrails and safety nets for China-U.S. relations, Xi said, according to a readout from China's foreign ministry that was just released.
[00:40:53.679 --> 00:41:06.699]  Xi's explicit message is notable because it appears to be the first time red lines were issued at the presidential level, said Igor Krestin, a managing director of global policy at the George W. Bush Institute.
[00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:18.030]  Gee went on to say, the U.S. always says one thing and does another.
[00:41:18.409 --> 00:41:20.469]  It will be detrimental to its own image.
[00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:21.409]  And it goes on.
[00:41:21.849 --> 00:41:22.710]  What did I say earlier?
[00:41:22.809 --> 00:41:24.829]  They're sick of everyone telling them one thing and doing another.
[00:41:26.869 --> 00:41:29.130]  Gee threatened again over Taiwan, all of it.
[00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.809]  So there you go.
[00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.590]  All right.
[00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:38.489]  And those communists were put in by the CIA in 1949. And then all our jobs were basically shipped over there by the 90s.
[00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:41.190]  And now China double-crossed Obama.
[00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:42.190]  And then here we are.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.599]  Alright, so I have basically hit that.
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:51.760]  I will be back later tonight if anything else breaks.
[00:41:52.159 --> 00:41:53.320]  We're just updates from my house.
[00:41:53.539 --> 00:41:54.659]  Handheld with my phone.
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:55.860]  This is too important.
[00:41:56.559 --> 00:42:03.440]  I got a bunch of other news I'm going to hit now on other key topics and information.
[00:42:05.719 --> 00:42:07.280]  But this is very urgent.
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:16.920]  So again, I hope all of you take the live feed you're watching right now, either at Infowars.com forward slash show, man.video, or real Alex Jones on X or at AJNLive.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:17.840]  Be sure to follow us there.
[00:42:18.219 --> 00:42:25.440]  In case you shut down Infowars or try again, that's the new network at AJNLive there on X. That's a key place to get the feed there.
[00:42:27.329 --> 00:42:35.750]  I want to get into the left's other track of not just trying to start World War III or starting it, but trying to escalate it before Trump gets in.
[00:42:35.989 --> 00:42:39.690]  Also, the false flag angle of attacking migrants and blaming on Trump supporters.
[00:42:40.949 --> 00:42:44.369]  They basically have pre-programmed this so much, I'm sure they're going to do it now.
[00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:45.670]  Talked about that a lot.
[00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:55.909]  Democrat leaders calling for physically resisting federal agents that are lawfully picking up drug dealers and human traffickers and human smugglers.
[00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:58.170]  Again, that's in the Constitution.
[00:42:58.409 --> 00:42:59.610]  That's federal jurisdiction.
[00:42:59.929 --> 00:43:07.969]  That's one of the things we're supposed to do instead of helping the illegals get in under Obama's third administration that we call the Harris-Biden coup.
[00:43:09.389 --> 00:43:10.389]  So we're going to get to that.
[00:43:10.389 --> 00:43:14.190]  I'm going to get to Elon Musk and a very important breakdown.
[00:43:15.139 --> 00:43:28.099]  Of his vision that's very similar to my vision versus people like Niels de Grasse Tyson and the so-called science cult, which is anti-science and anti-innovation.
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:32.039]  That's all coming up.
[00:43:32.219 --> 00:43:36.179]  But I'm going to take a break here for a moment.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.539]  We had the winner...
[00:43:40.639 --> 00:43:44.059]  Of the amazing super truck here yesterday.
[00:43:44.639 --> 00:43:49.119]  To show you how cool, it was a major sweepstakes company that did this for the AlexShieldStore.com.
[00:43:50.699 --> 00:43:51.780]  Two-month contest.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.039]  Anybody that bought anything on the site got it entered to win.
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.179]  You can also enter your email for free and enter to win.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:01.619]  At the AlexShieldStore.com, there's a new truck and a new contest that will be announced in early January.
[00:44:02.059 --> 00:44:03.199]  Another super truck.
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.800]  It's time for Ford, not Dodge.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.239]  And...
[00:44:07.429 --> 00:44:11.309]  The guy is a former F-16 pilot and former 777 pilot.
[00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:13.190]  And we looked him up.
[00:44:13.289 --> 00:44:15.550]  He's been in the news as a famous pilot as well.
[00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:22.650]  But he bought two t-shirts and got the $136,000 truck and $10,000 cash.
[00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:26.489]  And it just makes it fun and it's great to meet random listeners.
[00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:31.190]  I've told him I'm going to start not just doing huge $100,000, $130,000 truck giveaways.
[00:44:31.329 --> 00:44:38.010]  I want to start having giveaways every couple weeks for like a motorcycle or a snowmobile or...
[00:44:39.059 --> 00:44:42.480]  You know, an all-expense trip to Hawaii or something cool.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.400]  You know, something in the $10,000, $20,000 range.
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:51.940]  And just because of how cool it is to randomly fly them here and meet the listeners.
[00:44:52.219 --> 00:44:54.920]  Instead of, you know, Bob Barker, come on down.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.940]  I mean, it's like, this is how cool our listeners are.
[00:44:58.039 --> 00:45:00.719]  The first winner, and he's like a super cool dude, man.
[00:45:01.039 --> 00:45:01.980]  Super smart.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:05.559]  Been listening to me for 25 years at least.
[00:45:06.769 --> 00:45:08.550]  Heard me on Pastor David J. Smith's show.
[00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:09.409]  God, he was a great guy.
[00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:10.889]  I used to go on his show all the time.
[00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:15.389]  He put up signs all over the country warning of the New World Order and the rest of it, and boy, was he right.
[00:45:16.369 --> 00:45:20.889]  So I want to play that, because this Musk thing is so important, I kind of want to just reset.
[00:45:22.369 --> 00:45:24.570]  Because I had it all in my head what I was going to say about Musk.
[00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.789]  It was really eloquent and thought-provoking and powerful.
[00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:32.730]  And then I get up here and cover World War III, and I'm just like, what was I going to say about Musk?
[00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:35.869]  If I have just a few minutes, I can kind of just...
[00:45:36.849 --> 00:45:47.349]  Get that magic again, because that's some really important points to say that need to be said about the different plans for humanity.
[00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.969]  And I'm not saying my plan or must plan is you should adopt.
[00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:54.389]  I'm saying you need to know there's plans for you by the globalist.
[00:45:54.949 --> 00:45:57.670]  And so we should promote other plans.
[00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:01.530]  That's how you really need a plan is not just oppose a plan, what you do.
[00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:03.010]  You also then have a better plan.
[00:46:03.679 --> 00:46:10.840]  Like prosperity and freedom and advanced technology and innovation and human goals and just exploration.
[00:46:11.639 --> 00:46:13.960]  That is the very nature of humans.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.619]  You think cats are curious?
[00:46:17.019 --> 00:46:22.599]  Well, if curiosity killed the cat, curiosity is what humans built civilization with.
[00:46:22.619 --> 00:46:26.239]  So I'm kind of going there now, aren't I? So let's air that.
[00:46:27.619 --> 00:46:29.260]  And then let's also...
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.320]  Let's air the new four-minute promo.
[00:46:34.519 --> 00:46:35.219]  It's just really cool.
[00:46:36.179 --> 00:46:40.900]  And then I want to air seven as well, the Trump victory merch that's amazing.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:48.119]  But I'm telling you, out of all the stuff at the AlexShieldStore.com, you want ultimate sea moss.
[00:46:48.219 --> 00:46:50.159]  People joke, they go, what's that off the bottom of your boat?
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.460]  It's Irish sea moss.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:57.000]  The only other plant that people argue, and you can look this up, might be a better superfood is hemp.
[00:46:57.769 --> 00:47:00.010]  And all the incredible good stuff that comes out of that.
[00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:02.110]  But CBD, you name it.
[00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:06.710]  But CMOS is different in the things it does.
[00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:11.010]  And we've got private labels, some of the top-rated stuff.
[00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:17.150]  I mean, the capsules are 40 grams equivalent in every serving two pills.
[00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:25.010]  The gummies are the equivalent of 20 grams just to the CMOS. And it's this concentrated organic iodine that just goes right in your cells.
[00:47:25.369 --> 00:47:29.230]  And then it's got, you know, they say there's 20-something essential minerals.
[00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:31.070]  No, it's more like, it's got the number here.
[00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:31.889]  It's like 100 and something.
[00:47:32.699 --> 00:47:37.900]  Because scientists know you need all these other trace minerals and elements that then carry it in.
[00:47:38.039 --> 00:47:47.539]  And however God made Irish sea moss, that stuff that grows around Ireland in their ocean, it's just, I mean, people ask why my skin's glowing.
[00:47:47.599 --> 00:47:48.840]  People ask why I'm so healthy.
[00:47:49.059 --> 00:47:51.940]  People ask why I've got so much energy in the last three months.
[00:47:53.239 --> 00:47:57.960]  Because they sent us four bottles of the advanced stuff from the company we probably label.
[00:47:58.059 --> 00:47:59.800]  It wasn't in the Alex Jones bottle.
[00:48:00.809 --> 00:48:02.289]  And they said, we're going with this.
[00:48:02.389 --> 00:48:03.050]  We think it's the hottest thing.
[00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:03.590]  What do you think?
[00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:05.710]  And I said, yeah, I've heard it's great.
[00:48:06.809 --> 00:48:09.030]  I asked my crew, why haven't we ever put this out?
[00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:09.989]  And I started taking it.
[00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:13.909]  I mean, I'm on four of the bad boys today.
[00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:21.510]  And just the energy, the focus, the clarity, just trust me, you want to get it.
[00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:23.909]  At the AlexDillStore.com.
[00:48:24.469 --> 00:48:28.309]  And by the way, we've got the best price on high-quality CMOS. You can buy crap CMOS for less.
[00:48:28.449 --> 00:48:34.050]  This is high-end for just a little bit more than crap CMOS. It's just raw CMOS. It's not concentrate.
[00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:35.489]  This is way more powerful.
[00:48:36.289 --> 00:48:38.750]  Equivalent of 40-gram concentrate of the CMOS alone.
[00:48:38.889 --> 00:48:40.670]  It's got the bladder rack.
[00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:41.030]  You know what?
[00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:42.409]  Since I'm doing it, let me just read this to you.
[00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:45.909]  Then I'll play the truck promo and we'll premiere the truck promo.
[00:48:47.469 --> 00:48:53.469]  Iris CMOS, rich in nutrients, boost immune system, supports digestive health, enhances skin health, promotes thyroid function.
[00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:54.610]  This is from ChatGPT.
[00:48:55.389 --> 00:49:10.690]  Rotes thyroid function, adds weight management, aids weight management, improves energy levels, supports respiratory health, thyroid support, anti-inflammatory, that's the bladder wrack, digestive aid, rich in antioxidants, skin health, weight management, joint support, improves vision,
[00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:11.929]  bladder...
[00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:24.449]  Burdock root, detoxifies the body, rich in antioxidants, improves skin health, supports digestive health, boosts immune function, balances blood sugar, anti-inflammatory, supports circulation.
[00:49:24.849 --> 00:49:32.289]  So I don't know if it's the bladder rack or the burdock root or the sea moss.
[00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:35.630]  It's also got pepperedine, black pepper concentrate.
[00:49:35.869 --> 00:49:36.829]  All I know is it's the formula.
[00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:40.550]  But they say it's the sea moss is the king daddy.
[00:49:40.769 --> 00:49:42.550]  So I mean, it's this formula.
[00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:48.630]  And just go get a bottle, and you'll be hooked, and then all I ask is get it from us.
[00:49:48.849 --> 00:49:51.590]  Okay, please, [...] please.
[00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:53.969]  Just believe me.
[00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:56.829]  My information is good on politics.
[00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:57.489]  It's excellent.
[00:49:58.050 --> 00:49:59.909]  It's good in geopolitical systems.
[00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:01.869]  It's the best there is.
[00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:03.110]  I think that's pretty much recognized.
[00:50:05.509 --> 00:50:08.889]  Well, I'm not going to sell you crap because I treat you like I want to be treated.
[00:50:09.469 --> 00:50:10.329]  That's how I always was.
[00:50:10.429 --> 00:50:12.530]  But then as I got older, I said, why do I do that?
[00:50:12.789 --> 00:50:14.289]  Well, I always want to have the best.
[00:50:14.449 --> 00:50:17.570]  And I'm like, well, that actually works great because then they like it and they get it again.
[00:50:17.809 --> 00:50:19.110]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:26.489]  It's, again, like having a restaurant that has good quality, tastes great at an affordable price that you love, that has good service, great service.
[00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:28.510]  So you go there all the time.
[00:50:29.739 --> 00:50:32.099]  I don't want to sell you something that isn't great.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.780]  I want the best t-shirt designs.
[00:50:34.179 --> 00:50:35.639]  I want the best supplements.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:45.639]  I mean, the Hydra Force, super high quality vitamins, minerals with great quality electrolytes.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.239]  So it's like vitamin fusion with electrolytes.
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.440]  That's a great product.
[00:50:50.099 --> 00:50:53.199]  55% off when you get three of any of the supplements.
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.820]  50% when you get two bottles.
[00:50:56.059 --> 00:50:57.199]  40% when you get one.
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.539]  And I've told the guys...
[00:50:59.679 --> 00:51:00.659]  Make the discount.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.460]  They just stop.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:03.619]  It's their company.
[00:51:03.679 --> 00:51:04.699]  They won't follow my directives.
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:09.199]  Because I see massive sales, but not a lot of money coming in on those.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.239]  Because when people get up at 55% off, we're not making anything, basically.
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:13.980]  And the t-shirts.
[00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:17.110]  I make like five, six bucks a shirt.
[00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:18.150]  They make five, six bucks a shirt.
[00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.849]  Sounds like a lot.
[00:51:18.949 --> 00:51:19.250]  It's not.
[00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:20.510]  There's not a lot of huge markup there.
[00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:23.789]  But there is in two of the shirts that are 50 bucks.
[00:51:23.929 --> 00:51:24.730]  So there's some real markups.
[00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:25.469]  We get some funds.
[00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:28.210]  And they give us that extra markup for the legal defense.
[00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:30.150]  Great folks at the AlexShieldStore.com.
[00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:34.769]  And then there's also the posters that, yeah, people are like, a poster's 50 bucks?
[00:51:34.909 --> 00:51:36.769]  Yeah, it's a limited edition fundraiser.
[00:51:36.889 --> 00:51:38.210]  So we get some real money.
[00:51:39.289 --> 00:51:42.730]  The poster, like, you know, in the tube, costs like seven bucks.
[00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:46.230]  The tube costs as much, you know, as the poster.
[00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:48.170]  They're high quality, though.
[00:51:48.269 --> 00:51:51.050]  The point is it's a memento that you kept us on air.
[00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:55.349]  Just like, again, PBS or something, you know, $100 for a coffee mug.
[00:51:55.409 --> 00:51:57.030]  No, the coffee mug probably cost $5, $6, $7.
[00:51:57.989 --> 00:51:59.389]  You know that when you buy it.
[00:51:59.489 --> 00:52:02.570]  It's a memento that you supported their communism and anti-American evil.
[00:52:03.409 --> 00:52:05.409]  Well, we don't...
[00:52:05.539 --> 00:52:07.099]  Also get taxpayer money like they get.
[00:52:07.239 --> 00:52:08.340]  We have you supporting us.
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:11.000]  We have the Democrats for seven years suing the stunt out of me.
[00:52:11.159 --> 00:52:12.139]  And we keep winning.
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:12.960]  We keep surviving.
[00:52:13.139 --> 00:52:14.159]  But it's because of you.
[00:52:15.039 --> 00:52:15.860]  I mean, look at that.
[00:52:16.019 --> 00:52:17.000]  Fight, fight, fight.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.000]  Look at that.
[00:52:18.239 --> 00:52:18.940]  Back to back to back.
[00:52:19.059 --> 00:52:19.619]  All three wins.
[00:52:19.719 --> 00:52:20.260]  You won all three times.
[00:52:20.679 --> 00:52:21.519]  That's a great poster.
[00:52:21.619 --> 00:52:22.199]  $29.95.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:26.079]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:52:26.699 --> 00:52:28.599]  I want to encourage you to go there now.
[00:52:29.219 --> 00:52:29.659]  All right.
[00:52:29.719 --> 00:52:30.659]  I'm going to take a breather.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:31.940]  It's not that I'm even tired.
[00:52:32.079 --> 00:52:33.420]  I'm actually so hyper right now.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:38.380]  On the Ultimate CMOS and Next Level Foundational Energy from DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:40.920]  Yeah, I'm out of control.
[00:52:43.679 --> 00:52:46.139]  That I got to get in my Jedi mindset to do the Mustang.
[00:52:46.139 --> 00:52:46.739]  This is important.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:48.840]  Because I'm going to cut this out of the live show and post it.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.559]  I know Elon will watch it, so I want to do a good job.
[00:52:50.719 --> 00:52:52.239]  For everybody, because what I'm going to say is true.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.179]  So, we're going to air the truck promo, and then...
[00:52:56.179 --> 00:53:00.539]  Yeah, air the Trump victory merch.
[00:53:00.719 --> 00:53:01.320]  After that, we'll be back.
[00:53:01.639 --> 00:53:02.139]  Stay with us.
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:11.139]  Well, the winner, Chris DiLaro, is here in studio from New Jersey, former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[00:53:11.179 --> 00:53:12.260]  What an amazing aircraft.
[00:53:12.519 --> 00:53:13.920]  Chris, I gotta say, man, we love you.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:14.739]  Thanks for the support.
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.280]  I love you, Alex.
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:18.539]  I love Bigley, Nate, Colin.
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:19.179]  Thanks, Chris.
[00:53:19.199 --> 00:53:24.360]  This is one of the pinnacles in my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there, just being in this studio.
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:25.519]  I never imagined I'd be.
[00:53:25.559 --> 00:53:26.500]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[00:53:26.559 --> 00:53:27.199]  You're the reason we're here.
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:29.739]  It's so cool how cool the listeners are.
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:30.219]  It is.
[00:53:30.579 --> 00:53:30.699]  Yes.
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:31.400]  Wow, thank you.
[00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:32.710]  The listeners are amazing.
[00:53:32.949 --> 00:53:38.690]  Like, everyone that goes to the Alex Jones store, obviously you're in it to win this truck, but this experience of coming on the show, how is this, Chris?
[00:53:38.869 --> 00:53:42.550]  I mean, is this not, this is like a, it's a dream, I would feel like, for the winner, right?
[00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:53.989]  Fortunately, I slept pretty good last night, but it's been very stressful because he said, Colin said, you're going on the show, and I was like, I'm a little camera shy, but here I am.
[00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:55.289]  You've done well, Lord Vader.
[00:53:56.179 --> 00:53:58.639]  I said I'll do whatever I need to do to help Alex and Bigly.
[00:53:59.239 --> 00:54:00.480]  Well, I'm glad I got to meet you.
[00:54:00.539 --> 00:54:02.340]  We're going to eat some barbecue from Terry Black's here in a minute.
[00:54:02.599 --> 00:54:04.000]  I'm starting to mouthwater when you said that.
[00:54:04.119 --> 00:54:04.659]  Oh, I'm starving.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.800]  Now, real quick, this is all done by a computer, by a professional company.
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:10.119]  I was talking to you guys before.
[00:54:10.659 --> 00:54:12.019]  Sometimes it's in the middle of it.
[00:54:12.059 --> 00:54:12.880]  Sometimes it's at the end.
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:13.860]  Sometimes it's at the start.
[00:54:14.599 --> 00:54:17.099]  Have you seen where somebody who entered on the first day won?
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:23.039]  You know, honestly, we've done probably 30 of these giveaways and have never seen someone win on the very first day.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:28.860]  But we have these multipliers that, you know, go into place, you know, maybe at the first week and the last week of the giveaway, right?
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:32.179]  And during these multipliers, if you spend, you know, $10, you get 100 entries.
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:34.280]  If you spend $100, you get 1,000 entries, right?
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:36.960]  It's a 10x multiplier for when you enter during that time period.
[00:54:37.099 --> 00:54:39.820]  You actually enter during the 10x time period, right?
[00:54:40.159 --> 00:54:42.800]  And at the end of the giveaway, we run the 10x time period as well.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.320]  So it was one of the best times to enter to win.
[00:54:45.659 --> 00:54:48.360]  And, I mean, you got, you know, more entries for how much you spent.
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:49.900]  With the new contest, where are we right now?
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.760]  So we are launching...
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:53.760]  It's live now.
[00:54:54.019 --> 00:54:54.920]  You launched two hours ago?
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.039]  I don't know what time we launched, but it's a...
[00:54:58.039 --> 00:54:58.920]  Can I tell them what it is?
[00:54:59.059 --> 00:54:59.260]  Yeah.
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:02.739]  It's a brand new Ford F-250 Super Duty trimmer.
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:03.360]  It's sick.
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:07.300]  It's all black, jacked up, 37-inch tires, 20-inch rims.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.159]  I mean, it's fire.
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:09.980]  Okay, so this just launched today.
[00:55:11.219 --> 00:55:12.460]  Yeah, it's live right now.
[00:55:12.599 --> 00:55:12.980]  I know that.
[00:55:13.099 --> 00:55:14.400]  If you go to the Alex Jones store right now.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.199]  We gotta coordinate more.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:15.960]  I didn't even know that.
[00:55:16.019 --> 00:55:16.920]  I've been on the air for like a week.
[00:55:17.039 --> 00:55:18.139]  I have the new deals up there.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.639]  I did want to speak to you, Sid.
[00:55:19.699 --> 00:55:22.000]  I hope y'all got the banners uploaded on the site, guys.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:22.500]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:22.679 --> 00:55:24.119]  That's why I was like, can I talk about it?
[00:55:24.179 --> 00:55:24.880]  I was looking through.
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:27.679]  But no, right now, the F-250 is live.
[00:55:27.679 --> 00:55:31.019]  It's a brand new 2024 Ford F-250 Super Duty.
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:33.699]  It's Alex Jones verified for sure.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:34.960]  He picked the wheels.
[00:55:35.079 --> 00:55:35.820]  He picked the tires.
[00:55:36.119 --> 00:55:36.840]  It looks good.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:37.219]  I don't know.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.320]  Yeah, we're showing it right here.
[00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:41.250]  It also comes with $10,000 in cash as well.
[00:55:41.289 --> 00:55:42.250]  Chris, do you have that on you?
[00:55:42.429 --> 00:55:44.409]  Well, I might have a little something here.
[00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:45.369]  Oh, okay.
[00:55:47.269 --> 00:55:48.349]  There's my zipper pocket.
[00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:48.750]  Okay.
[00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:50.989]  So, yeah, this is not a hoax, people.
[00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:52.610]  That is...
[00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:54.570]  I haven't counted them yet.
[00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:55.190]  I'm gonna mug him.
[00:55:55.289 --> 00:55:55.869]  I'm taking it back.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.460]  Thanks for the donation!
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:00.159]  I would probably just give it to Alex.
[00:56:00.159 --> 00:56:01.119]  Don't do that, I'm joking.
[00:56:01.519 --> 00:56:01.880]  Joking.
[00:56:02.099 --> 00:56:02.679]  I know, I know.
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:03.420]  It's a joke.
[00:56:03.659 --> 00:56:19.460]  Somebody can be like Chris, they can go to thealexjonesstore.com, they can order the great CMOS, order any of the great supplements, t-shirts, hats, whatever, and you're entered to win a badass, brand new F-250 trimmer, fully loaded pickup truck, and you get $10,000 in cash, and we fly you down here, you get to meet Alex,
[00:56:19.559 --> 00:56:24.719]  you get to be on the show, and you get to eat a really badass short rib from Terry Black's BBQ. That's exactly right.
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:25.280]  Please stop talking.
[00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:29.750]  And one thing we don't talk about, if you just enter your email, you're still entered to win.
[00:56:29.869 --> 00:56:35.909]  And then every time Alex drops a video, when the onion fails miserably again, you'll be the first people to hear about it.
[00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:39.889]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com, enter your email, join the VIP club.
[00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:43.250]  I promise you next week what you'll get for being in the VIP club.
[00:56:43.389 --> 00:56:44.510]  You'll be very excited.
[00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:46.349]  And everybody that entered won.
[00:56:46.989 --> 00:56:48.789]  All right, David DeLauro, thank you so much.
[00:56:48.849 --> 00:56:51.969]  Nate Hughes, Colin Sanders, thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:06.809]  Now is the time to wear Trump gear.
[00:57:06.989 --> 00:57:09.949]  And we've got the best designs at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:12.289]  You support the Second American Revolution.
[00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:14.070]  You exercise your free speech.
[00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:16.010]  You stand up to the bullies.
[00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:20.349]  You exercise your will.
[00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:26.449]  And it keeps this broadcast, and we're shut down next week, still on the air at the Alex Jones Network.
[00:57:27.389 --> 00:57:30.829]  It'll be on the radio, the TV, all the same stations.
[00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:31.849]  It's all set up.
[00:57:32.909 --> 00:57:41.070]  The crew, the studios, all of it, but we need more funds to ensure we're full power when we continue our assault.
[00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:46.469]  So you're literally in the information war, refueling the aircraft, loading the weapons, arming them.
[00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:54.869]  And we've already got a lot of weapons loaded, but we need to be fully loaded when we take off at maximum load for maximum attack when we do our attack runs in the information war.
[00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:59.590]  So, we're on the tarmac right now, making sure everything's straight here.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.500]  You need to go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:58:03.039 --> 00:58:06.079]  A beautiful black shirt with an American eagle and gold.
[00:58:06.199 --> 00:58:06.960]  Says Trump won.
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.679]  Beautiful red hoodie.
[00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:10.079]  People are going crazy over that.
[00:58:10.519 --> 00:58:11.940]  We're on White with Trump won.
[00:58:12.699 --> 00:58:20.760]  Today is your Independence Day, 120. 25. Yeah, that's when we really have the Independence Day, when we keep them alive and it gets in there.
[00:58:21.239 --> 00:58:21.820]  That's great.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:25.260]  So many new hats, all of it made right there in Arkansas.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.440]  So you get this stuff quick.
[00:58:26.559 --> 00:58:27.380]  It's already being made right now.
[00:58:28.099 --> 00:58:29.340]  A lot of new Trump shirts and stuff.
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:30.199]  It'll take them weeks to get done.
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:31.019]  Not our sponsor.
[00:58:31.219 --> 00:58:31.980]  They're ready right now.
[00:58:32.059 --> 00:58:34.719]  So your order's in at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:58:35.659 --> 00:58:38.019]  So many amazing designs, thealexjonesstore.com.

[00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:10.050]  TheAlexJonesStore.com is not owned by me.
[00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:11.750]  It's not owned by InfoWars.
[00:59:12.449 --> 00:59:13.989]  The lunatics at The Onion.
[00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:17.469]  And it turns out it is Bloomberg behind the whole thing with Soros and the big national gun control group.
[00:59:17.550 --> 00:59:18.230]  They've now admitted that.
[00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:20.110]  So we're going after them.
[00:59:20.829 --> 00:59:22.369]  The DOJ have false suits.
[00:59:23.469 --> 00:59:26.010]  Last Tuesday and others filed suits.
[00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:28.389]  We have them by the shorthairs.
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:34.400]  So no matter what happens when you support the AlexShieldStore.com, you're going to keep me on air at the Alex Shields Network if they do shut this down.
[00:59:34.579 --> 00:59:35.579]  So it is vital.
[00:59:36.019 --> 00:59:37.039]  I can't do it without you.
[00:59:37.079 --> 00:59:37.800]  This is a team effort.
[00:59:38.019 --> 00:59:39.079]  You are this broadcast.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.059]  You are the info war.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.059]  Thanks for the support.
[00:59:41.239 --> 00:59:42.460]  The AlexShieldStore.com.
[00:59:42.639 --> 00:59:43.420]  And then, of course...
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:51.300]  My dad's a great supplement company, drjonesnaturals.com, for your quercetin, for your CoQ10, the highest quality at 40% off.
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.380]  So great for your body and next level foundational energy.
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:54.539]  There's no other energy like it.
[00:59:54.719 --> 00:59:55.539]  It doesn't have any letdown.
[00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:59.659]  It's all at drjonesnaturals.com, and we can't do it without you, so thank you.
[00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:00.099]  All right.
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.519]  Stop right there.
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.059]  I'm about to talk about something really important.
[01:00:12.159 --> 01:00:31.269]  Now, I'm about to talk about something that is at the heart of what it is to be human and about what fulfills humanity and what builds a future That is for humans.
[01:00:31.869 --> 01:00:43.969]  The globalist technocrats, the death cult, the antinatalists that are anti-family, anti-human, anti-child on record, like the heads of Google that openly told Elon Musk that decades ago, they're like, we don't like humanity.
[01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:44.690]  We're going to get rid of humanity.
[01:00:44.809 --> 01:00:46.969]  You're a pro-human.
[01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:49.869]  And he said, you bet I am.
[01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:55.769]  And then they took his son away from him and began sterilizing him and killing him.
[01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:57.550]  His son is dead.
[01:00:57.710 --> 01:01:03.710]  He's still alive, but as an individual, as what his destiny was, that's been murdered.
[01:01:04.449 --> 01:01:10.929]  Just like Anakin Skywalker ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and died and became Darth Vader.
[01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:14.909]  So, Musk's brother got really sick from the shot.
[01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:16.289]  A lot of his employees got sick from the shot.
[01:01:16.389 --> 01:01:17.849]  He had his big wake-up.
[01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:19.949]  He was already pro-human.
[01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:21.989]  Already has a bunch of children.
[01:01:22.389 --> 01:01:31.460]  You can already look at the numbers and see that if we don't have 2.1 children at least, For every two adults, that's not replacement rate, and society collapses in all the actuaries and numbers.
[01:01:32.679 --> 01:01:39.099]  So the globalists at the WEF, their main high priest, Yvonne Harari, Klaus Schwab, King Charles have all said...
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:46.380]  There are too many people, and the future is not human, and by 2047, we'll all be cyborgs.
[01:01:46.519 --> 01:01:47.480]  There'll be no more humans.
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.960]  I mean, this is really a hate-letter humanity.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.119]  They want us to turn off our life force, turn off our survival instinct.
[01:01:54.239 --> 01:01:58.659]  They want us to hate ourselves with all the fake environmentalism that isn't about saving the Earth.
[01:01:58.739 --> 01:02:04.360]  It's about giving them full power and control over carbon to reduce it, whether it's cows or whether it's people.
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:05.500]  You are the carbon.
[01:02:06.079 --> 01:02:07.119]  They want to reduce.
[01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:16.269]  So, there's been a movement for decades to get rid of the military, having humans make it all machine, robot, that gives the globalists full control.
[01:02:16.469 --> 01:02:17.710]  The machines will follow orders.
[01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:21.730]  There's been major moves to not have manned spaceflight.
[01:02:21.869 --> 01:02:23.190]  It's cheaper to send a robot.
[01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:26.349]  But we don't do things because it's cheaper.
[01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:29.530]  We do things because it builds a human culture.
[01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:30.070]  When you...
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:44.000]  Follow Bill Gates' directive 15 years ago at a teacher's conference, they all cheered for it, or a bunch of them did, that if you don't give an old lady any health care, you can hire 10 teachers with that money, but that's a death panel, he said, and they all laughed.
[01:02:44.579 --> 01:02:46.780]  When he says we've got to reduce the carbon down to zero...
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:03:05.119]  And talks about getting rid of humans at the TED TV talk, they laugh, because they're into the cult of selfishness and hate and believing they can do anything they want bad to other humans because at the end of the day, we're horrible, evil parasites and we'd be better off with no humans, says the New York Times and the Washington Post and CNN and even Fox News.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.539]  Too many kids is what's making the planet worse.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:11.619]  New York Times headline, looking forward to the end of humans.
[01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:19.809]  I've been in grocery store checkout lanes and seen the magazines in the racks many times saying, a future without humans is what we should all want.
[01:03:20.889 --> 01:03:28.650]  When the head of the UT biology department in 2007 came out and said, I can't wait till airborne Ebola is released to kill 90% of the world population.
[01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:30.969]  He got a standing ovation to the Texas Federation of Scientists.
[01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:31.789]  It was in the newspaper.
[01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:41.429]  His graduate students who'd gone on to be bioweapons leaders came out and attacked me and said, Alex Jones is the threat.
[01:03:42.469 --> 01:03:43.369]  Bianca's too liberal.
[01:03:43.550 --> 01:03:44.690]  We should get rid of all humans.
[01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:49.909]  That's in my film Endgame, showing what they said in response to him, saying kill 90% of us.
[01:03:50.110 --> 01:03:52.989]  The Georgia Guidestones, saying cut us down to 500 million.
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:04:00.760]  So we need to go to Mars because humans need big, giant, collective goals.
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:12.639]  Not individuals being made to do that, but individually believing in great goals, discovery, innovation, and then by free will supporting it and then sharing in it together.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:20.280]  We must become a type 1 civilization for consciousness to ensure the consciousness of humanity continues on.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:30.719]  Not just in case we destroy the planet, not because we don't want to save the planet, But to ensure that we can survive if something does happen to the planet.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.639]  That's what this is all about.
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:54.099]  And building a human future, believing in a system that is for humans, by humans, is at the very heart of what we are, innovators, trailblazers, mavericks.
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:00.679]  And so, that's where we are.
[01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:05.320]  And the globalists don't like humanity.
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.179]  They don't like themselves.
[01:05:06.179 --> 01:05:08.960]  They're projecting their own hatred of themselves onto us.
[01:05:09.119 --> 01:05:16.440]  And the entire environmental movement is meant to make you guilty and hate yourself and believe the world's ending and things are going to collapse and that it's all your fault that's going to happen.
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:21.980]  So as the globalists carry out the great reset, collapsing civilization, they can turn around and say, it's your fault.
[01:05:22.159 --> 01:05:23.739]  The third world's collapsing and starving.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:28.840]  Not because of three years of lockdowns that admittedly caused it, but no, because of global warming.
[01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:36.449]  I mean, there's actual New York Times headlines that say, looking forward to the end of humans.
[01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:41.309]  So, you've seen them.
[01:05:41.409 --> 01:05:42.090]  I've seen them.
[01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:45.329]  Bill Joy, 1999, Wired Magazine, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
[01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:49.469]  He goes to a big globalist tech conference with 200 tech billionaire leaders.
[01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:51.190]  They have meetings and have a consensus.
[01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:52.570]  It's time to get rid of humanity.
[01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:53.409]  Go read it.
[01:05:53.570 --> 01:05:54.289]  It's free online.
[01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:56.650]  Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
[01:06:02.570 --> 01:06:04.670]  There it is, looking forward to the end of humanity.
[01:06:04.809 --> 01:06:05.530]  Oh, Wall Street Journal.
[01:06:06.869 --> 01:06:18.750]  And it came out in the New York Times that Bill Gates met in secret with world leaders, including Oprah Winfrey, in 2004 to decide on a plan to depopulate the earth using a global government and the threat of viruses.
[01:06:21.469 --> 01:06:26.010]  Headline, Billionaires Meet in Secret to Discuss the Problem of Overpopulation.
[01:06:26.389 --> 01:06:27.170]  London Guardian.
[01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:29.809]  Everything I'm telling you, you can look up.
[01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:37.210]  Bill Gates says he wants to get rid of people, but he wants you to take a shot so you don't die, but now they admit the shot erases your immune system and kills people en masse.
[01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:41.349]  So say what you want about Elon Musk.
[01:06:41.570 --> 01:06:59.690]  He is a maverick in everything he's done, from space exploration to To PayPal, to getting President Trump elected, to taking over X. When it was Twitter for twice what they said it was worth and now making it the number one site in the world.
[01:07:02.929 --> 01:07:16.530]  But he says his greatest work, the reason he's accumulating all of this wealth is because he doesn't want to go to venture capitalists and have them say they want to go to Mars because they're going to make money.
[01:07:17.949 --> 01:07:21.530]  It's because it's about exploration.
[01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:31.949]  It's about the spiritual message and mission of us being a type one civilization, meaning we would survive if the planet was destroyed.
[01:07:31.949 --> 01:07:35.909]  We are not bound to one place.
[01:07:39.449 --> 01:07:41.789]  And then they have Niels de Grasse Tyson.
[01:07:43.199 --> 01:07:51.300]  Who constantly says the most unscientific, already disproven crap, and then says don't ever question him, he is the science.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:57.619]  And you have this science cult that is anti-science, telling you two men can have a baby.
[01:08:00.019 --> 01:08:02.219]  And there are no X and Y chromosomes.
[01:08:05.119 --> 01:08:06.119]  And that...
[01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:10.469]  The howling idiot Los Angeles crowd makes fun of Elon Musk.
[01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:11.269]  He's stupid.
[01:08:11.409 --> 01:08:12.030]  Ha ha ha.
[01:08:12.590 --> 01:08:14.590]  He's not going to make money going to Mars.
[01:08:14.849 --> 01:08:32.109]  Under international law, under historic common law, the first company or government that can go to a new land and stake it out and hold it Is the owner.
[01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:36.489]  Has Elon Musk said, I'm going to Mars, so I'm the owner of Mars?
[01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:41.750]  Has Elon Musk said, I'm going to go to the asteroid belt?
[01:08:45.029 --> 01:08:46.630]  Because I'm going to own it?
[01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:46.890]  No.
[01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:50.609]  There is unlimited resources in space.
[01:08:51.829 --> 01:09:00.779]  And the development of technology to get there is easier at this point Then Magellan circumnavigating the globe.
[01:09:07.739 --> 01:09:10.020]  So we're already there.
[01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:12.039]  We just have to want to do it.
[01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:29.649]  And Musk has taken the SPACE program in just the last 10 years and accelerated it at least tenfold what all previous SPACE program did In the 80 years before that...
[01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:45.739]  So, again, the science, the innovation that will come out of this, and the daring, we need to send humans to Mars because it is dangerous.
[01:09:45.739 --> 01:09:58.560]  We need to send systems to space that can sustain humans so that we learn, so that we say, no, we're going to build a universe and technology and systems that empower humans.
[01:09:58.699 --> 01:10:04.880]  Humans are the only creature on the Earth that controls and builds its own environment.
[01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:22.789]  The innovations of air conditioning and medicine and science and telecommunications and electricity and all of it is tinker toys compared to what we have in our hands now.
[01:10:22.890 --> 01:10:33.239]  And if we have an economy based on innovation of the ocean and exploration and innovation and exploration of space, That is the anti-death cult.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:41.140]  That is the pro-team humanity where you're not wearing a jersey for your football team or basketball team because you don't care about that because it doesn't matter.
[01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:43.539]  It's just a diversion.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.100]  Bread and circuses.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.140]  You wear the jersey for team humanity.
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:52.500]  You wear the jersey for SpaceX or the competing interest.
[01:10:53.159 --> 01:10:55.300]  And I guarantee you, Elon Musk will welcome that.
[01:10:56.539 --> 01:11:02.390]  But no one else can do it Because they don't have the vision and the will and the focus.
[01:11:03.289 --> 01:11:21.689]  I mean, Elon Musk says three years ago, I want the Starship, the biggest, by far, heavy lifter in history, to land and have giant metal robot arms grab it.
[01:11:21.729 --> 01:11:22.949]  And he does it.
[01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:24.289]  And it works.
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:34.260]  That is the innovative spirit and the innovative spark that you have to have to build a Panama Canal.
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:35.399]  The French couldn't do it.
[01:11:35.439 --> 01:11:35.899]  We did it.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:45.520]  And all of these other incredible things, instead of making hydrogen bombs, let's create, which they already have, free energy.
[01:11:46.539 --> 01:11:47.739]  Let's do it all.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.720]  Let's not keep this from humanity.
[01:11:50.649 --> 01:11:57.770]  Let's not decide humanity's garbage and that we're going to just get rid of it and have some new super silicon creature that rises from it.
[01:12:02.949 --> 01:12:09.350]  So let's go to this Neil deGrasse Tyson clip on Bill Maher and just listen to these idiots.
[01:12:10.729 --> 01:12:12.449]  Sit there and poo-poo this.
[01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:16.289]  And Elon Musk said, wow, they really don't get it.
[01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:19.590]  Mars is critical to the long-term survival of consciousness.
[01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:23.529]  Also, I'm not going to ask any venture capitalists for money.
[01:12:23.689 --> 01:12:25.890]  I realize that it makes no sense as an investment.
[01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:28.390]  That's why I'm gathering resources.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.619]  Meanwhile, the globalists don't want to go to space.
[01:12:34.239 --> 01:12:38.619]  They want to control the animals and the people and take over the genetics.
[01:12:38.819 --> 01:12:47.279]  It's not a vaccine to inject cows that take over their immune systems and don't let them have bacteria in their guts that actually produce nutrients.
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:48.319]  That's what does it.
[01:12:48.399 --> 01:13:03.909]  No, we're going to just change them and mutate them and see what happens and that That's the final frontier, them playing God,
[01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:11.149]  them cutting off your resources and saying you will eat the bugs so they can make you the elaborate in their experiment unwittingly.
[01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:20.350]  Instead, Musk says, let's all be part of the experiment of expansion of consciousness and true laissez-faire human innovation and the new ultra-Renaissance.
[01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:25.890]  So this is what we're meant to do, and we must embrace our humanity.
[01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:27.710]  We must embrace humanity.
[01:13:29.059 --> 01:13:29.899]  Exploration.
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:32.319]  We must embrace trailblazing.
[01:13:32.439 --> 01:13:34.319]  We must embrace the maverick spirit.
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.060]  And that's the final bubble.
[01:13:40.859 --> 01:13:45.680]  The singularity is accelerated expansion, not some singularity where it all ends.
[01:13:45.899 --> 01:13:47.279]  No, it all expands.
[01:13:48.399 --> 01:13:51.840]  There's that door song written by Jim Morrison.
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:56.380]  The future's uncertain and the end is always near.
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:03.520]  Roadhouse Blues, and I posted on X last week, I read exactly what I said.
[01:14:03.659 --> 01:14:11.939]  It was, the future is certain, and expansion is always here.
[01:14:15.699 --> 01:14:18.359]  Expansion will always be happening.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.760]  The question is, do you want to be part of it?
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:23.779]  So...
[01:14:24.949 --> 01:14:26.569]  There's not just evil in the universe.
[01:14:26.569 --> 01:14:27.170]  There's good.
[01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:31.470]  But when good comes along, we have to realize it and we have to embrace it.
[01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:43.210]  And it doesn't mean it's some perfect good, but what Donald Trump and Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson and Elon Musk and you symbolize is pro-human.
[01:14:43.369 --> 01:14:44.250]  You can see it.
[01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:45.350]  You can feel it.
[01:14:45.409 --> 01:14:45.949]  You can taste it.
[01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:47.430]  You see the fruits of it, as Christ said.
[01:14:49.529 --> 01:14:58.439]  Now, is our Role model Yuval Noah Harari and King Charles and Klaus Schwab?
[01:14:59.199 --> 01:15:01.819]  Or is it Donald Trump and Elon Musk?
[01:15:02.479 --> 01:15:08.920]  And in the media and in the info war, is your role model Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson or is it Rachel Maddow?
[01:15:09.859 --> 01:15:12.439]  Well, it turns out people want freedom.
[01:15:12.619 --> 01:15:13.579]  They want innovation.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:14.939]  They want straight shooting.
[01:15:15.159 --> 01:15:16.720]  I demand straight shooting.
[01:15:17.079 --> 01:15:19.020]  It's my religion is the truth.
[01:15:21.199 --> 01:15:22.659]  I want to get it just right.
[01:15:22.659 --> 01:15:24.500]  I want to put out accurate information.
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:26.579]  I want to receive good information.
[01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:28.140]  Because that's how you build.
[01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:29.159]  That's how you're empowered.
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:35.020]  So here's Neils DeGrasse Tyson, and then I'm going to respond to it.
[01:15:35.039 --> 01:15:35.359]  Here it is.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:41.060]  How soon could Elon Musk realistically send humans to Mars?
[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:42.300]  Another good question.
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:43.920]  I have strong views on that.
[01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:54.539]  My read of the history of space exploration is such that we do big expensive things only when it's geopolitically expedient, such as we feel threatened by an enemy.
[01:15:55.079 --> 01:16:00.979]  And so for him to just say, let's go to Mars because it's the next thing to do, what does that venture capitalist meeting look like?
[01:16:01.119 --> 01:16:01.960]  So Elon, what do you want to do?
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:02.579]  I want to go to Mars.
[01:16:02.779 --> 01:16:03.399]  How much will it cost?
[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:04.119]  A trillion dollars.
[01:16:04.319 --> 01:16:04.859]  Is it safe?
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.140]  No, people will probably die.
[01:16:06.359 --> 01:16:07.500]  What's the return on the investment?
[01:16:07.699 --> 01:16:08.020]  Nothing.
[01:16:08.159 --> 01:16:10.239]  That's a five-minute meeting, and it doesn't happen.
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.619]  So, we agree.
[01:16:12.779 --> 01:16:13.659]  I'm not for going to Mars.
[01:16:13.699 --> 01:16:14.159]  Okay, wait, wait.
[01:16:14.619 --> 01:16:16.079]  We got nothing against Mars.
[01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:18.899]  What I'm saying is, here's how we get to Mars.
[01:16:19.039 --> 01:16:19.119]  Ready?
[01:16:19.279 --> 01:16:20.460]  China leaks a memo.
[01:16:20.539 --> 01:16:21.340]  It doesn't even have to be true.
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.560]  They leaked a memo that they want to put military bases on Mars.
[01:16:24.739 --> 01:16:29.180]  Dan, we are on Mars in 10 months when NASA doesn't have a spacecraft, but Elon does.
[01:16:29.439 --> 01:16:31.039]  Here's my spacecraft to Mars.
[01:16:31.229 --> 01:16:33.890]  And we end up paying him to use his spaceship to get to Mars.
[01:16:34.050 --> 01:16:37.609]  And that'd be easy for China, because Mars is already red, right?
[01:16:37.710 --> 01:16:38.630]  So that'd be easy sell.
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:42.560]  That'd be an easy sell.
[01:16:43.359 --> 01:16:43.779]  Okay?
[01:16:44.579 --> 01:16:45.340]  That's how...
[01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:51.119]  So I don't see it happening until governments judge that it's geopolitically in our interest.
[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:53.960]  Otherwise, I don't see it as just an exploration.
[01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:57.100]  But I believe President-elect Trump has some interest in Mars.
[01:16:57.239 --> 01:16:57.880]  So we might...
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:59.920]  You might have another conversation in a couple of months.
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.560]  At some point, somebody has to pay for it.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:04.119]  And just being interested in something is not the same thing as paying for it.
[01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:05.729]  He believes there are people there.
[01:17:05.909 --> 01:17:08.649]  I mean, I listened to that podcast with Joe Rogan.
[01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:10.890]  It took four hours and two bottles of wine.
[01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:18.470]  Why do his comments on what he thinks is alive on Mars matter to you at all?
[01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:21.189]  Because I was wondering...
[01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:26.010]  Maybe he might escape there for the holidays.
[01:17:27.899 --> 01:17:30.020]  You know you got me stuck on the damn holidays now.
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:32.520]  The point is, you can't live on Mars.
[01:17:32.859 --> 01:17:34.220]  I've said this so many times.
[01:17:34.539 --> 01:17:47.819]  How badly would we have to ratfuck Earth before it was worse than a place that's 200 below zero, with no air, no water, with six months...
[01:17:47.819 --> 01:17:48.180]  Preach it!
[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:48.720]  Preach it!
[01:17:53.289 --> 01:17:53.869]  You two.
[01:17:54.670 --> 01:18:01.470]  In addition, Elon wants to terraform Mars, and if you do that, you could then just walk off a spaceship and breathe the air.
[01:18:01.630 --> 01:18:06.250]  But if that's Earth Plan B, what did you do to Earth that now you gotta go to Mars?
[01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:12.689]  If you messed up Earth, but you're good enough to turn Mars into Earth, then you can turn Earth back into Earth and never have to go to Earth.
[01:18:12.949 --> 01:18:13.090]  Yes!
[01:18:13.090 --> 01:18:13.090]  Exactly!
[01:18:22.459 --> 01:18:39.380]  These are the type of people that would say, don't go to the New World, or don't get in wagon trains and go west, or why are the Wright brothers building an airplane out of balsa wood and paper with bicycle wheels?
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:44.300]  And again, that way it's finite money.
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:47.420]  There's unlimited money if you have resources and ideas.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.600]  Money is just the symbol of exchange.
[01:18:52.489 --> 01:18:57.050]  And so they're howling and laughing at Elon when those people aren't real scientists.
[01:18:57.289 --> 01:18:58.729]  They don't really know anything.
[01:18:58.729 --> 01:19:00.069]  They don't really innovate anything.
[01:19:00.289 --> 01:19:01.229]  They don't do anything.
[01:19:01.949 --> 01:19:08.369]  They just sit around laughing with all this technology around them that other people developed, giggling about it.
[01:19:11.109 --> 01:19:17.010]  And then look, oh, they want trillions for illegal aliens and trillions to, oh, plenty of money to cut little boys' penises off.
[01:19:18.090 --> 01:19:24.630]  But man, if you want to go to space, if you want to go to Mars, by the way, Mars has a southern and northern ice cap.
[01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:28.909]  Mars has all sorts of resources we don't have.
[01:19:30.909 --> 01:19:32.229]  Same thing with the asteroid belt.
[01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:47.050]  And if you went back 200 years ago and showed somebody a 777 Boeing, and they told you you could get on that and, you know, fly out from L.A. in five hours, six hours, be in Hawaii, they wouldn't even know what Hawaii was.
[01:19:48.449 --> 01:19:51.729]  There are people thinking incredibly small, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:53.449 --> 01:19:56.289]  You get off the planet, you have unlimited resources.
[01:19:56.829 --> 01:20:18.859]  Of course you have robots do most of it at first, but you get the toehold, you excite everybody about it, and then you send out the robots and you do it all, and then you set up these outposts and giant space stations with gravity Because they're spinning,
[01:20:19.159 --> 01:20:20.699]  and it's kick-ass.
[01:20:21.479 --> 01:20:23.199]  And obviously that's what you do.
[01:20:25.359 --> 01:20:30.659]  I don't have to tell you all the innovation we've gotten out of the space program, but the people in control now want a post-industrial world.
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:36.159]  They want to take all the industry and fuel, even the old technology from us, and then depopulate us and slowly poison us to death.
[01:20:36.319 --> 01:20:37.720]  And Elon Musk is fighting that.
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.359]  But we need symbols.
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:44.220]  So, first, go to the moon.
[01:20:46.079 --> 01:20:48.359]  It's better to do a Mars shot from there anyways.
[01:20:50.199 --> 01:20:51.880]  And there's a lot of stuff going on there.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:52.739]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:56.579]  Right at the edge of the dark side where it can't be surveilled.
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:01.000]  And yeah, Musk is in charge of the secret space program.
[01:21:01.979 --> 01:21:03.880]  He's not putting Tinker Toys up in space.
[01:21:04.039 --> 01:21:16.100]  They're going to launch over 400 space launches in the next couple of years with the Starship and the Falcon Heavy.
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:26.819]  And under Trump and Musk, they're going to start showing you the space planes and showing you all the real stuff and just go, yeah, here it is.
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:30.460]  And then all the other countries will roll over, China and Russia.
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:31.800]  The technology is so advanced.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.680]  We're already in the year 2050, folks.
[01:21:35.279 --> 01:21:36.340]  The future is here.
[01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:39.680]  It's just not equally distributed.
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.460]  All right.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:46.779]  Musk is floating possible MSNBC acquisition.
[01:21:47.079 --> 01:21:51.640]  The only reason it's good is it's on the cable systems and he'd be on all the TVs in the country.
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:58.600]  That's still a small audience compared to X and the rest of it, but it would be good to get to some of the older folks on cable.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:01.100]  It'll be bigger than Fox News very quickly.
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:03.640]  I think he'll probably do it.
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:09.420]  You've got the Denver mayor now backtracking.
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.859]  It's up on Infowars.com when he called for violent attacks.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:16.279]  On the feds trying to, and he asked the citizens to do it, trying to cause a civil war.
[01:22:17.039 --> 01:22:20.680]  Then the deep state would then attack some of the migrants and say that Trump people did it.
[01:22:22.039 --> 01:22:24.840]  That's the other big false flag operation they're setting up there.
[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:28.739]  You got MSNBC saying never stood a chance.
[01:22:29.239 --> 01:22:31.239]  The sympathy for Lakin Riley's killer.
[01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:32.479]  Obviously you know about that.
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:40.979]  There's a lot of other news, and I'll be back tomorrow, unless the feds come in and try to shut us down again or successful this time, at 4 p.m.
[01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:42.579]  Central, 5 p.m.
[01:22:42.779 --> 01:22:47.399]  Eastern for Sunday Night Live with myself and Chase Geiser and the rest of the crew.
[01:22:47.479 --> 01:22:50.460]  But I'm going to stop there so the crew can get back to see their family.
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.060]  We've done an hour and a half here live tonight.
[01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:57.939]  There's a lot that I didn't get to, but it'll wait till tomorrow.
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.720]  A lot of really important news here.
[01:23:02.039 --> 01:23:03.500]  And it's up at Infowars.com.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:04.760]  It's up at AlexJonesOnX.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:05.479]  Please follow me there.
[01:23:05.579 --> 01:23:07.640]  Please follow me at AJNLive.
[01:23:08.739 --> 01:23:10.600]  That's the backup network, the Alex Jones Network.
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.039]  And please support me.
[01:23:14.859 --> 01:23:16.760]  We're innovating in the fight against the globalists.
[01:23:18.359 --> 01:23:23.239]  Tomorrow's news today, we're supporting Trump getting into office, getting inaugurated in the agenda.
[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:25.539]  We're watching these nominees.
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:27.180]  Most are good, some are really bad, but...
[01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:30.369]  It is what it is.
[01:23:30.869 --> 01:23:32.210]  And we're going to be here.
[01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:34.649]  And we will innovate and expand if you support us.
[01:23:35.029 --> 01:23:36.409]  Right now, it's just about survival.
[01:23:36.789 --> 01:23:37.729]  Plus, it's great products.

[01:23:45.109 --> 01:23:45.449]  All right.
[01:23:45.449 --> 01:23:48.569]  I'm going to go ahead and end this transmission.
[01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:50.310]  I want to thank the crew for coming in on Saturday evening.
[01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:56.789]  And I want to go ahead and end it with a little promo that is my final...
[01:23:58.190 --> 01:24:01.329]  Dessert or addendum that I guess a fan made.
[01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:08.930]  I saw this on X today with one of my rants about team humanity and being a human supremacist.
[01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:11.729]  And that's what this is all about.
[01:24:12.609 --> 01:24:16.210]  And that's what Elon Musk is saying is he's pro team humanity.
[01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:20.409]  He said, I don't know what we call, you know, being pro-life and not in the death cult.
[01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:22.710]  When I interviewed him, he interviewed me two and a half hours.
[01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:25.250]  And I said, it's team humanity.
[01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:26.010]  Let's launch team humanity.
[01:24:26.090 --> 01:24:26.449]  He goes, yeah, that's it.
[01:24:26.529 --> 01:24:26.869]  It's team humanity.
[01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:29.109]  So, this is what's happening.
[01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:34.770]  We have to not just challenge the globalist death cult, exterminist collapse system, great reset.
[01:24:34.930 --> 01:24:35.869]  We have to have an alternative.
[01:24:36.069 --> 01:24:46.109]  And I'm not saying what I'm saying is what we should adopt, or what Musk is even doing, but at least we're talking about goals and talking about unification and talking about things of that nature.
[01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:49.069]  So, here it is.
[01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:54.250]  And the live show will end, and it'll be restreamed on X until I'm back live tomorrow at...

[01:25:00.819 --> 01:25:02.220]  And again, tell those you tell to share it.
[01:25:02.279 --> 01:25:05.340]  Tell them to tell those they share it with to share it and so forth and so on.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.060]  Completing the chain reaction.
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:08.600]  We are Team Humanity.
[01:25:08.779 --> 01:25:10.359]  We are human supremacists.
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:14.000]  I am a human supremacist!
[01:25:14.239 --> 01:25:17.439]  I am a human supremacist!

[01:25:27.819 --> 01:25:30.640]  Our supremacy will not end with this planet.
[01:25:30.979 --> 01:25:33.020]  We will people the stars.
[01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:34.199]  We will colonize.
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:36.199]  We will green dead worlds.
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.039]  We will go interdimensional.
[01:25:38.539 --> 01:25:39.960]  We will unlock the secrets of the universe.
[01:25:40.319 --> 01:25:42.739]  God has laid them out like Christmas presents for his children.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:55.520]  And I am extremely honored to be in the fulcrum and the heart of the fight to bring our race, the human race, in a race for the future.
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:58.340]  I am honored to be here.
