[00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.950]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.710]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the Infowars.
[00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.609]  It's Monday, November 11th, 2024.
[00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.609]  InfoWars to be shut down in just three days.
[00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.390]  We have caught the globalists publicly plotting a major coup against Trump in America.
[00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:29.089]  This broadcast could stop them.
[00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:30.949]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.649]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:48.119]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:50.460]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.600]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:30.349]  69 days, 23 hours, 58 minutes, 56 seconds, the most important moment in modern human history in the fight for liberty and freedom when we get President Trump inaugurated on the south side of the Capitol in Washington,
[00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:34.719]  D.C. It is Monday, November 11th, 2024.
[00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:39.420]  I am your host and your chronicler, Alex Jones.
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.480]  Very honored and blessed to be here with you today.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.840]  All right.
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.019]  We have an incredible responsibility here at Infowars to cover all of this.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.219]  And tens of millions will watch the live show today and listen to it.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:06.500]  But we have an even bigger responsibility with my intrepid crew to take all these segments out that are on different key pieces and get those out to the public.
[00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.639]  And then to also take large chunks of the broadcast where I integrate it all in together and get it out to the public.
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:25.719]  Because just the clips we're putting out every day right now are reaching conservatively 70 plus million people.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.759]  That's a low estimate.
[00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.740]  And we're not just reaching the general public.
[00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:36.479]  We are reaching the state houses, the federal government, foreign governments, corporations.
[00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.379]  People are really paying attention.
[00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:39.400]  And it's all God.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.319]  And it's an incredible responsibility that we have right now.
[00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:45.500]  We have the world's ear.
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.259]  People have seen us be right so many times.
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.240]  Continue to call things exactly as they're happening because we are totally immersed in this.
[00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:05.669]  And so I want to commend all the viewers and listeners who are the key to all of this, the Paul Revere's, who are taking the live feeds, who are taking the clips, who are clipping stuff out yourselves and sharing it.
[00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:15.789]  When I say 70 million people, that's just on Infowars and our streams and X and talk radio estimates that tune into large portions of the live show.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.120]  I mean, if you add the live show feeds on other systems, I can't even keep track of it at this point.
[00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.159]  When I say 70 million, that's very conservative.
[00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:29.680]  Tens of millions tune into large parts of the live feed.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.180]  70 plus million watch the clips just on our sites and acts.
[00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:39.960]  And some days it's been 200 million in the last few weeks.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.379]  The 70s A guesstimation, lower average.
[00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:46.840]  So we have an incredible responsibility.
[00:03:47.219 --> 00:04:00.659]  That's very newsworthy, obviously, that we are reaching more people than anyone else covering the geopolitical ramifications of this victory and what the enemy's planning to strike back with.
[00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.180]  And it's amazing.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.659]  The only other person reaching more people right now is Elon Musk, and he's reaching 10 times what we are.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.099]  So, this is not a competition.
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:23.339]  I'm simply reporting to you the victories that we're having, like you do at any war, and just also remind folks that we need your prayers here at InfoWars because we are a major target.
[00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:26.829]  And I am not going to spend a lot of time on that, obviously.
[00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:27.829]  You already know that.
[00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.149]  I just need your prayers.
[00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.009]  I need your word of mouth.
[00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.170]  And I need your financial support.
[00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.889]  Because we're doing great on the victories and great reaching people.
[00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:44.009]  We are not in the best position when it comes to being able to launch a whole new operation if we're shut down in three days.
[00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.709]  InfoWars is sold to the bad guys.
[00:04:46.329 --> 00:04:48.370]  And I don't want to come out of the blocks wobbly.
[00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:50.860]  When we get handed the baton.
[00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:57.040]  So I need your support right now at the AlexShieldStore.com with great Patriot apparel, Trump one year, great supplements and more.
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.279]  Take action now.
[00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:00.220]  That is so critical to the entire future.
[00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:02.040]  Fight the AlexShieldStore.com.
[00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:03.480]  Massive news straight ahead.
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.100]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.199]  It is Monday, November 11th, 2024.
[00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:10.019]  I am your embattled host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:15.980]  And we are living in the most incredible time in our lifetimes in modern history.
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.439]  Hands down, no doubt about it.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.959]  Total global realignment against the globalist death cult.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.959]  Humanity waking up in the 11th hour.
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.240]  It is beyond epic.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.459]  And to have this broadcast and this incredible audience of men and women in the arena of incredible activists is stunning.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.399]  I am beyond thankful to you.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:48.220]  To say that I salute you is not even one millionth of what I feel towards you and what we've gone through together and what this crew has put up with.
[00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:53.980]  And the incredible urgency that we are living in right now.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:20.720]  The existential threat to humanity's very existence and the fact that we are struggling for our very existence and that we are coming back and that we are winning is just spectacularly enriching and gives new words and new meaning to Attempts to try to describe it.
[00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:24.600]  Exhilarating.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.639]  Empowering.
[00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:33.759]  Now, I got ready for this broadcast for three hours last night after the family went to bed.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.800]  And I got up at 4 a.m.
[00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:37.259]  and studied for another three hours.
[00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:41.620]  Then I exercised and came in here and got ready for another hour.
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.939]  And I absolutely must cover all of this.
[00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:47.959]  And I will.
[00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:54.139]  All this on my desk is not props we put out here each day of, oh, look, he's got a bunch of information.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.740]  This is all so important.
[00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:01.540]  Every single story, every single video, hundreds and hundreds of them.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.959]  Now, it'll be impossible to hit each one in detail.
[00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:07.899]  So let me do this.
[00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:14.439]  Let me give you a summation of what I see and the different moving parts here.
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:25.759]  And then, what the enemy has signaled they're going to do in the past, in the present, and projecting into the future.
[00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:43.240]  And if we simply understand their evil, understand their desperate, get inside their minds, get inside their heads like a general does, and think about the enemy, and think about how they operate, because you've got to know yourself, but you've also got to know your enemy just as good as you know yourself.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.519]  And I do know the enemy, and you know the enemy.
[00:07:46.709 --> 00:08:01.029]  And all the victories we're having now is because we have admitted they're evil, we have admitted they're committing all these mass crimes, and we are catching them because we're not naive and the gaslighting doesn't work of, oh, nothing's happening, go away.
[00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.970]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[00:08:03.329 --> 00:08:03.810]  Move along.
[00:08:04.709 --> 00:08:26.069]  So, I have multiple stacks in multiple states where the Republican Party, under the leadership of Laura Trump, And Susie Wiles and others have the lawyers,
[00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:39.549]  have the experts, pre-lawsuits and all the battleground states even be able to be there, looking at the machines that they blocked us from doing four years ago and called a criminal.
[00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:44.289]  An election official went and looked and found fraud, you know, seven years in prison.
[00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:49.059]  Because they hadn't done the process under the law to be able to do that.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.919]  It was already baked in.
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:09:09.320]  And they are catching them in Georgia and Michigan and Arizona and Wisconsin all over with glitches that flipped house races to Democrats and in live time.
[00:09:10.659 --> 00:09:12.620]  And this isn't it in the national news.
[00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.509]  That's corporate news and nobody really watches it.
[00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:18.830]  We're the national news now.
[00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:20.950]  Tucker Carlson's the national news now.
[00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.009]  Elon Musk is the national news now.
[00:09:25.629 --> 00:09:27.570]  Gateway Pundit's the national news now.
[00:09:27.809 --> 00:09:29.090]  We're not the alternative media.
[00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.269]  We're the people's media.
[00:09:30.549 --> 00:09:38.649]  We've got the biggest audiences and we're right and we're good and we love God and we love justice and we're kicking tyrants' asses.
[00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:47.639]  Because we grew up, we admitted we were under attack, we admitted our enemies are evil, And then we set about rolling up our sleeves.
[00:09:49.039 --> 00:09:56.419]  All over the country, they're catching glitches that flip seats to the Democrats, and it's being reversed in live time.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.779]  I'll be getting into that.
[00:10:00.379 --> 00:10:00.759]  Michigan.
[00:10:01.179 --> 00:10:05.340]  Four counties in Michigan find over 26,000 votes days after the election.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.480]  Several seats flip from Democrat to Republican, including one Michigan House seat.
[00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:13.500]  And I've got more.
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.220]  Proof of the fraud.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.440]  Oh, but it's just a glitch.
[00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:27.639]  Just like all the glitches they admitted with Dominion and others just so happened to flip the votes from Republican to Democrat.
[00:10:28.179 --> 00:10:40.940]  Isn't it funny how in Texas and Georgia and Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin, not just Dominion, these voting machine companies all over the...
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.759]  Oh, it's just flippy whipsies.
[00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:48.070]  So, there's that.
[00:10:48.929 --> 00:11:03.570]  That's one stack out of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 stacks.
[00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:05.889]  And a big giant video list.
[00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.490]  So, just a quick summation.
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:26.539]  We have the Democrats all over the place, official talking points, that they want Biden to step down so that Harris can become the first woman president.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:36.580]  Really, they rejected her in a landslide, but now she was appointed as the nominee in a coup that's still ongoing for the next 69 days.
[00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:37.600]  We're in a coup.
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.940]  It's not that they're plotting a coup.
[00:11:39.039 --> 00:11:39.559]  We're in one.
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.440]  And they intend to stay in power.
[00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:49.950]  And if they can put her in there, then they can kill Trump, kill Vance, stage giant false flags.
[00:11:51.049 --> 00:11:53.389]  They don't kill Trump, try to drive him from power.
[00:11:55.669 --> 00:11:57.970]  Literally cut the power off, say the Russians did it.
[00:11:58.029 --> 00:11:59.250]  I mean, they've been pre-programming all that.
[00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:12.389]  I don't know which one they're going to pull, but if you think they're going to just leave with all the crimes they've committed and the giant human trafficking, including sex slavery of children, and if you think these cornered rats are going to give up, you're naive.
[00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:13.129]  And you know what?
[00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.029]  You're not naive.
[00:12:14.649 --> 00:12:21.250]  People are watching them in government, in corporations, in the media, in culture, and they are badly coordinated.
[00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:28.179]  It'd be like in a boxing match, again, with Muhammad Ali, 12th round.
[00:12:28.299 --> 00:12:29.600]  He's still got energy and he's there.
[00:12:29.759 --> 00:12:31.980]  And the other side's bleeding out the eyes, the nose.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.100]  They got cuts all over their face.
[00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:36.419]  And they look like they got spaghetti for legs and they're just stumbling around.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.000]  And you know any minute Muhammad Ali's just going to go, boom!
[00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:41.259]  And they're going to fall down like a sack of potatoes.
[00:12:43.379 --> 00:12:46.500]  So, we're winning, make no mistake.
[00:12:46.779 --> 00:12:49.379]  And they are badly coordinated and out of their minds.
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:54.779]  But that makes them even more dangerous to trigger a massive war in the next 69 days.
[00:12:57.159 --> 00:12:57.740]  You name it.
[00:13:00.419 --> 00:13:02.480]  So, they are on television.
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.000]  I already played the clip Saturday and Sunday.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.059]  I probably won't play them again today.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.480]  They're on the side if you want them.
[00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:08.200]  They're on my X channel, Real X Jones.
[00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:08.840]  You want to go see them.
[00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:15.539]  But they're on TV saying, we want Biden to step down and put Harris in.
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.059]  And that means they could kill him if he doesn't do it.
[00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:25.730]  And then that isn't constitutional, just like appointing her as the nominee wasn't.
[00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:37.009]  People say, well, even if, you know, she becomes the president, even if they kill Trump or Vance, that doesn't make them, the Democrats, the president under the Constitution.
[00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:39.090]  Since when do they follow the Constitution?
[00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:44.809]  They turn the power off in most of the country for a couple of weeks and kill the Internet.
[00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:47.990]  We'll be in a whole other ballgame.
[00:13:48.149 --> 00:13:50.370]  And I look at the different scenarios there.
[00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:55.309]  They'll all end up not just in prison if they do that, but definitely where the Nazis went.
[00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.429]  But it doesn't mean they're not going to try it.
[00:13:57.929 --> 00:13:59.190]  That won't succeed either.
[00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.710]  I mean, here's where we're at.
[00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.210]  Anything they do now will fail.
[00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.990]  The question is, do we have a giant nuclear war or a giant civil war?
[00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.730]  You know what Klaus Schwab has said?
[00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:17.690]  A cyber attack will make COVID look like a minor inconvenience.
[00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.570]  And they've got that all pre-programmed and ready, so there's that.
[00:14:22.889 --> 00:14:28.389]  Massive attack on migrants or black people at some black gathering that they say is imminent.
[00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:31.669]  They've already busted, quote, white supremacist Trump supporters trying to do it.
[00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:38.860]  Is that them saying, oh, we caught these but didn't catch the big one coming?
[00:14:39.019 --> 00:14:44.820]  Or maybe there's good people in the federal government that know about these groups they've wound up and have ready, like the Whitmer kidnappers.
[00:14:44.919 --> 00:14:47.100]  And so good feds go ahead and shut it down.
[00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:50.879]  I'm speculating there, but I predicted you'd see that right before the election and after.
[00:14:51.179 --> 00:14:52.659]  And the Democrats said that.
[00:14:53.399 --> 00:14:55.159]  Trump's going to come kill minorities.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.480]  No evidence, no proof.
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:01.120]  So obviously when it happens, you know the feds provocateur did it or some mercenary group did it.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.440]  So, we're just waiting for that.
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.820]  And we're telling the establishment, you're losing.
[00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:07.779]  You've been routed.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.600]  The initiative is totally on our side.
[00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:11.120]  No one's going to buy it.
[00:15:11.299 --> 00:15:14.360]  I mean, you could have a real crazy person go out and do something now.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.379]  You'll get blamed for it.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.120]  And there are some real crazies on all sides out there.
[00:15:19.259 --> 00:15:23.700]  But the point is that you're done.
[00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:26.799]  The globalists need to give up now.
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.039]  And there's a good chance...
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:39.340]  They've got all these plans going, and they had them beforehand for civil war conditions, and black men need to uprise because Trump's coming to kill you if he gets into the presidency, James Carville.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.220]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.799]  They don't say that for no reason.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:50.639]  There's a good chance, though, that there's so many people in the federal government that were just kind of compartmentalized that are now awake, and even the bad guys know this isn't going to work.
[00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:59.139]  Even people they've got that would do bad stuff in the past are going to not show up and not going to carry out the mission because they're smart enough to know it's not going to work.
[00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:04.139]  And they can see the old establishment is being pushed out.
[00:16:06.019 --> 00:16:12.320]  And people can see Trump's going in to get rid of the bad guys and remove them with this latest Nikki Haley Pompeo move.
[00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:18.980]  So I have to report to you what they're planning, what they pre-program, what their moves are.
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.500]  Because they were planning this if he was able to win.
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.000]  They were planning to not certify Trump.
[00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:34.120]  They were planning to cause racial riots as the cover for civil unrest so they can bring in martial law and call it a civil war between white and black.
[00:16:34.659 --> 00:16:36.320]  Most people see through that.
[00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:40.039]  And even evil people that work for the system are like...
[00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:44.039]  They just want the stock market to go up and their kids be able to have a life.
[00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:48.399]  And so they'd be evil if they were on the winning team, but now they see it's not going to work.
[00:16:48.539 --> 00:16:49.639]  So they're like, don't do it.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.159]  Don't do it.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.440]  And I'm seeing major signs that's happening.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:59.600]  But it doesn't mean that different factions of this whacked out system aren't going to pull some major crap.
[00:17:00.679 --> 00:17:16.619]  And a lot of their operatives have talking points to different factions, so they're still out there running the old program, even though the awakening has expanded and exploded so much that most of the smart ones are saying, we need to just sit this one out and hope the populace go back to sleep or something.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.599]  Which, by the way, isn't going to happen.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.400]  But the best move for the bad guys is...
[00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:26.329]  Back off, back down.
[00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:28.930]  If you really want to be safe, roll over to us.
[00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:33.630]  Come out and signal that you're against the globalists like Michael Douglas just did.
[00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.349]  And understand we beat you.
[00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:37.910]  Alright?
[00:17:43.509 --> 00:17:44.410]  That's where we are.
[00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.869]  And if you don't want to join us...
[00:17:50.079 --> 00:17:52.480]  And be part of a pro team humanity system, that's fine.
[00:17:53.019 --> 00:17:54.180]  You can just go away.
[00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:57.839]  I use this cheesy Star Wars Empire Strikes Back analogy of Darth Vader.
[00:17:58.019 --> 00:18:01.279]  He's got Luke Skywalker at the end of a lightsaber, and he says, you are beaten.
[00:18:01.619 --> 00:18:02.940]  It is useless to resist.
[00:18:03.259 --> 00:18:04.799]  You see us as the bad guys, that's fine.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:05.759]  That's where we've got you.
[00:18:05.819 --> 00:18:06.500]  We're not Darth Vader.
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.660]  Your bosses are, but you see us as Darth Vader, that's fine.
[00:18:08.759 --> 00:18:09.420]  We've got you.
[00:18:10.059 --> 00:18:10.680]  You're beaten.
[00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:12.460]  It is useless to resist.
[00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:18.430]  You can just jump off the tower and hope somebody saves you down there at the bottom.
[00:18:18.569 --> 00:18:21.250]  But you need to either join us or jump off the cliff.
[00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:21.650]  Okay?
[00:18:22.329 --> 00:18:23.250]  That's your options.
[00:18:24.089 --> 00:18:28.250]  Because you definitely do not want to try to drag us with you.
[00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.349]  Because then the gloves are going to be completely off.
[00:18:31.869 --> 00:18:37.690]  And if you really, really, really, really, really want to go down this path...
[00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:41.759]  You're insane.
[00:18:42.359 --> 00:18:46.519]  And there are some people in the system that are insane and that aren't going to give up.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:52.160]  So we have to expose them, explain who has the motive for terror attacks blamed on Trump supporters.
[00:18:52.279 --> 00:18:54.140]  It's certainly not us and we don't support it.
[00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:57.799]  And when it happens, if it happens, that you guys did it.
[00:18:58.539 --> 00:19:00.180]  Because we're catching you in the election fraud.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.720]  We're catching you in the human trafficking.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.880]  We're catching you in all the money laundering.
[00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:05.299]  We're catching you in the pedophilia.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.500]  We're catching you in your World War III crap.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.000]  We're catching you in your bioweapons.
[00:19:09.119 --> 00:19:10.819]  We're catching you in your poison shots.
[00:19:11.019 --> 00:19:12.160]  That's coming out all over the world.
[00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:18.099]  It was premeditated to annihilate our immune system and destroy our fertility and kill old people and cause heart attacks.
[00:19:18.259 --> 00:19:19.339]  It's all coming out.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.359]  And so that's the big takeaway.
[00:19:26.619 --> 00:19:34.440]  And they still are, it's trending everywhere in the corporate media and Facebook and everywhere that Trump stole the election and Elon Musk stole it with his magic satellites.
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.740]  Absolutely no connection to reality.
[00:19:38.079 --> 00:19:49.359]  And the women are shaving their heads and saying no sex for you and have no idea they have Stockholm Syndrome to the globalists that literally want to take everything they've got and make them eat bugs and sterilize them.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.299]  And of course those women, no men want those women anyways.
[00:19:52.299 --> 00:19:53.960]  Those women aren't even around men already.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.079]  They already hate men and already are married to the government.
[00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.279]  And Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates is their daddies.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:05.160]  And so it's just the final stage of them shaving their head and saying, men are the enemy.
[00:20:05.299 --> 00:20:11.259]  And there's just countless videos of women, professors, you name it, online saying, we're going to kill men.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.680]  We're going to shoot you.
[00:20:12.839 --> 00:20:14.019]  We're going to kill you.
[00:20:14.119 --> 00:20:15.640]  I don't care if you voted for Harris.
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.160]  I'm still going to kill you.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.240]  These are NPC robots of the establishment.
[00:20:27.019 --> 00:20:30.359]  And you just got to realize they may never wake up.
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.640]  They can't admit they were wrong.
[00:20:31.759 --> 00:20:33.000]  They can't admit they've been conned.
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.140]  They bought into the system so much.
[00:20:35.259 --> 00:20:51.400]  They're on so many serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and you just have to be nice to them like they're a crazy homeless person that you drive by and you see them eating poop or something.
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.559]  You just got to roll your window up, lock your doors, and just say, man, that's too bad.
[00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.630]  I wouldn't engage them.
[00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.210]  I wouldn't try to explain it to them.
[00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:03.630]  They can't be reached.
[00:21:03.829 --> 00:21:05.009]  Only God can do that.
[00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:07.690]  So...
[00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.329]  It's very sad.
[00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:19.869]  There's also ongoing battles for the House of Representatives.
[00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:24.289]  And the Democrats are holding up these elections to try to steal them.
[00:21:26.189 --> 00:21:36.549]  But now that there's so many RNC lawyers in there, and people aren't naive, it'll probably end up them stringing this out, getting more seats for Republicans.
[00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:51.490]  But we need a lot of seats extra because even the stay-behind groups in the Justice Department will try to indict a bunch of new House members, take them off the board like they've done the last four years, and they'll probably even murder, suicide.
[00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:52.730]  Some of them, they've done that before.
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.299]  Or, you know, have somebody come to a baseball game and try to kill them.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.920]  And we've got that.
[00:22:01.099 --> 00:22:02.619]  Owen has got all the latest numbers.
[00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:05.019]  He's going to be with me in the fourth hour.
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:10.660]  He'll be in the other studio with the big board going over the trifecta, the House, the Senate.
[00:22:13.509 --> 00:22:18.650]  We're good to go.
[00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:43.720]  So kind of like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, she's hanging on like the Skeksy Queen in the Dark Crystal and refusing to hand over her scepter.
[00:22:46.059 --> 00:22:54.910]  And we've got Carrie Lake As she predicted, they've been holding back Trump ballots, claiming they malfunctioned and things.
[00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:59.829]  And then when she was behind some, as soon as the new ballots came in, she was gaining and about to win.
[00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:03.269]  And then they closed the doors yesterday and overnight.
[00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.529]  As you know, she lost.
[00:23:08.049 --> 00:23:10.029]  So there needs to be an investigation of that.
[00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.710]  They really hate her.
[00:23:12.089 --> 00:23:15.569]  Trump had that landslide in Arizona, but magically, boy, they really got it out for her.
[00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.190]  It just didn't work again.
[00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:20.450]  She really gets under their skin.
[00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:30.349]  And you've got the MAGA and the RINOs battling for Senate leadership with Mitch McConnell leaving the Chinese Communist agent.
[00:23:33.829 --> 00:23:37.309]  But let me go to break.
[00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.029]  There's a lot more here.
[00:23:39.569 --> 00:23:44.849]  And then I'm going to drill into the globalist attack profile.
[00:23:48.329 --> 00:23:52.470]  Because they've got the governors calling in emergency sessions.
[00:23:53.750 --> 00:24:08.609]  And Democrat strongholds like California and Massachusetts, New York's talking about it, to block Trump and all the evil stuff he's going to do as the cover for them violating federal law and trying to protect illegal aliens.
[00:24:09.329 --> 00:24:11.349]  Trump's got to be really careful about this, though.
[00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:13.410]  And I'm going to get into that.
[00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:23.440]  And he has brought in A hardcore guy to do it.
[00:24:23.599 --> 00:24:27.880]  He's appointed Tom Homan as border czar, and it needs to be done.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:28.559]  It has to be done.
[00:24:28.579 --> 00:24:29.599]  It was a U.N. invasion.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.539]  But they end up grabbing somebody in a mistaken identity who's a citizen.
[00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:41.190]  And the media is going to blow it up and really try to brainwash Hispanics with that.
[00:24:41.289 --> 00:24:42.269]  I think they're on to stuff.
[00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:43.450]  So I don't think it's going to work.
[00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:45.829]  Or maybe there's some violence.
[00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.390]  Something happens.
[00:24:46.509 --> 00:24:47.269]  A kid gets killed.
[00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.690]  Trump has to be very careful about this.
[00:24:49.809 --> 00:24:52.670]  And just get the drug dealers and the human traffickers first.
[00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:53.710]  There's a lot of them.
[00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:55.230]  At least a million of them.
[00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:56.829]  Get them first.
[00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.450]  Then make an initiative to find the kidnapped kids.
[00:25:01.869 --> 00:25:03.390]  And then you've got everybody on your side.
[00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:04.269]  It's the right thing to do.
[00:25:04.369 --> 00:25:05.430]  The children need to be saved.
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:17.000]  And then you can get the military-aged men and the people that didn't get jobs, and then just leave the women and the kids alone.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:22.299]  The refugees from the UN and the globalists shutting down their third-world countries.
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.920]  They were brought here under that attack.
[00:25:27.099 --> 00:25:28.460]  They were told to come up here by Biden.
[00:25:28.859 --> 00:25:30.299]  Many of them have been sex trafficked.
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:31.700]  Many of them have been in slave labor.
[00:25:32.079 --> 00:25:45.039]  And on a case by case basis, Trump can then do the right thing and be a savior and wave the executive wand and give amnesty to a lot of the women and children.
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:51.579]  Now, a lot of the children were stolen from their homes, so they've got to find out where they're from, Guatemala, Mexico, other areas.
[00:25:52.039 --> 00:25:56.859]  They can be repatriated, and the federal government was involved in this.
[00:25:57.259 --> 00:25:58.059]  You talk about reparations.
[00:25:58.119 --> 00:25:59.039]  These are people alive now.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.160]  They need to be given a nice chunk of money.
[00:26:01.299 --> 00:26:02.859]  It'll cost way more to keep them here anyways.
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.440]  And get them back to where they're from, reunite them with their parents.
[00:26:06.759 --> 00:26:11.519]  The Republicans can send camera crews down there and show it, and be the heroes.
[00:26:11.519 --> 00:26:12.500]  It's the right thing to do.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:28.920]  If this is handled wrong, and the Democrats are betting everything on this, that's how they're going to try to get the riots going and derail, getting the economy back on, stopping World War III, getting all the secret technologies deployed to the public for innovation,
[00:26:29.519 --> 00:26:41.680]  massive space program, rebuilding the military, shutting down the globalist agenda, getting all these new Republicans elected to take over the state houses, and we'll have a supermajority forever, basically.
[00:26:44.139 --> 00:26:52.880]  If Trump is careful about what he's going to do with the border, and they're going to scream and yell and call everything he does bad.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:58.160]  The point is, we've got to be very careful about this.
[00:26:59.119 --> 00:27:05.140]  They are betting everything on sabotaging this, and it's the right thing to do, and it's replacement migration, and we've got to do it.
[00:27:05.339 --> 00:27:11.680]  But let's start with the over 10 million men that are here illegally.
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:13.980]  Let's start with them.
[00:27:14.619 --> 00:27:15.640]  That's what you do in a war.
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.720]  Go after the men.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.799]  The women, the kids, the quote Tony Montana.
[00:27:21.099 --> 00:27:21.680]  Be right back.
[00:27:21.799 --> 00:27:22.220]  Stay with us.
[00:27:22.519 --> 00:27:27.539]  I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's gonna save this country and nothing's gonna stop it.
[00:27:28.579 --> 00:27:32.099]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[00:27:32.279 --> 00:27:34.900]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:35.799]  I'm still not in shape.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.099]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.180]  Don't tell me you're eating right.
[00:27:39.259 --> 00:27:39.920]  I'm not gonna bite it.
[00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:43.549]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:45.430]  Oh, no!
[00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:48.250]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:54.369]  I did it all from the alexjonesstore.com with Ultimate Seamoss, the ultimate seafood.
[00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:55.289]  That's why, right here.
[00:27:56.069 --> 00:28:01.150]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[00:28:01.289 --> 00:28:02.910]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:04.849]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[00:28:07.569 --> 00:28:11.529]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss.
[00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.849]  And I am doing a plug here because, you know, we could be shut down next Tuesday.
[00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.309]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court.
[00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.630]  But we'll continue on in the air one way or another, working with great folks.
[00:28:25.289 --> 00:28:31.130]  We are unified by our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:35.910]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of information.
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:42.819]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.039]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.660]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.680]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.400]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:02.759]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the new world order and BlackRock.
[00:29:03.039 --> 00:29:06.039]  They've declared war on us and we accept the challenge.
[00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:15.190]  AlexJones.network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:19.329]  Infowars can be shut down in just a few weeks.
[00:29:19.569 --> 00:29:26.029]  But regardless, the fight continues at AJN Live on X, the Alex Jones Network.
[00:29:26.289 --> 00:29:29.930]  If the globalists think they're going to shut us down, we've got another thing coming.
[00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:34.329]  The Second American Revolution continues on at AJN Live.
[00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:38.809]  Follow me there now for news updates and critical intel as we restore our republic.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's really happening.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.440]  All right, I want to plow into their plots, what they're planning.
[00:29:49.839 --> 00:29:53.079]  They are seriously working to not leave power.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.460]  I don't expect them to be successful.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.240]  If we're honest about it and get ahead of it, we're going to do that in a moment.
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:06.660]  But about a week and a half ago, I cut that little announcement you just saw, and I said in a couple of weeks we could be shut down.
[00:30:07.099 --> 00:30:08.619]  Well, now it's not a couple of weeks.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.619]  It's Wednesday afternoon.
[00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:32.170]  InfoWars, the equipment, InfoWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and a whole bunch of other stuff is at a federal bankruptcy auction from the fake judgments and the rigged trials where I was found guilty beforehand and they had literal show trials out of the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
[00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:39.730]  Right when I walked in here during the break after getting a glass of water, saw the auctioneers.
[00:30:41.219 --> 00:30:45.359]  Inside the building, going around surveying from the last time they were here to make sure all the stuff's here.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.240]  Everything tagged, everything marked, this desk, these tables, this microphone.
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.859]  They're in the control room right now.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.819]  So that's how close this is.
[00:30:57.559 --> 00:30:59.420]  Now, good guys say they're going to buy it.
[00:31:00.299 --> 00:31:02.259]  Okay, they're good guys, they buy it.
[00:31:03.019 --> 00:31:05.299]  Who knows if they're really good guys once they buy it?
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.079]  We've got to see.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.119]  I don't count on any of that.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:16.480]  So working with our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, a new studio's been set up.
[00:31:16.759 --> 00:31:24.420]  Satellite uplinks, servers, equipment, legal, everything to keep fighting because they're going to keep coming after us.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.799]  We've won major battles, not the war yet.
[00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:31.940]  So I need funds right now.
[00:31:32.579 --> 00:31:36.140]  And if we had plenty of funds, I'd tell you that.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.859]  We don't.
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:44.339]  We have barely enough to just kind of walk along.
[00:31:44.339 --> 00:31:45.240]  I want to run.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.720]  I want to accelerate.
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:49.819]  Plus, these are amazing products.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.579]  I need you to make the decision right now.
[00:31:52.099 --> 00:31:53.220]  This is about action.
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:32:00.960]  That's why we overrode the fraud and why we won and we weren't bullied and we got Trump in and now we got to get him inaugurated and we've got to fight once he's in there.
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.039]  We've got to be his...
[00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:08.450]  Intel, grassroots that exposes bad people if they slip into the administration.
[00:32:08.829 --> 00:32:12.809]  Our most important work wasn't last week, and that was a huge victory.
[00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.970]  It's now.
[00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.970]  The real heart of the battle is now, and you know that.
[00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:23.849]  So, keeping the Alex Jones Show on the air is critical.
[00:32:23.849 --> 00:32:37.029]  So if you go to thealexjonesstore.com, everybody that's going to buy something there, whether it's incredible supplements or the great patriot apparel or limited edition knives, Needs to be a VIP member.

[00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:48.549]  Everybody, if you're going to support, should be a VIP member.

[00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:46.190]  Because the average shirt costs printed and made $15, $16, those are quality.
[00:33:47.579 --> 00:33:50.940]  Then if you're getting an XXL or bigger, they could cost up to $18 for the shirt.
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:55.019]  Well, then our sponsor gets part of the money and their crew and their factories and their people have to make some money.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:00.680]  So we end up getting half of what's there.
[00:34:00.819 --> 00:34:05.400]  Well, on that, we get like six, seven bucks, eight bucks if it's a smaller shirt.
[00:34:05.839 --> 00:34:06.380]  That's great.
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.760]  We got to sell a lot of shirts to get some real money in there.

[00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:52.989]  And those are limited edition, and we get real funds in when you do that.
[00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:56.309]  It's all there at the AlexJonesStore.com.
[00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.750]  Then...
[00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:07.190]  If you go to our other sponsor that's critical of the future of this operation, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:35:07.309 --> 00:35:12.190]  That's my dad, retired doctor, his supplement company, huge sponsor, great supplements.
[00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.969]  The next level of foundational energy is next level.
[00:35:15.269 --> 00:35:17.730]  It isn't a stimulant, but it feels like one with no letdown.
[00:35:17.989 --> 00:35:21.150]  It's the breakdown of folic acid that most people can't break down folic acid.
[00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:26.909]  It's the engine of the cells, cleans out the mitochondria, antioxidant, everything, hits you in 30 minutes.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:29.619]  No letdown.
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:35.320]  And if you don't have a problem processing them, folic acid, you know, that's what's in spinach.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.340]  That's why Popeye Strong with a fetish eats the spinach.
[00:35:38.079 --> 00:35:39.099]  You'll just get some energy.
[00:35:39.139 --> 00:35:41.059]  But most people have issues with it.
[00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:42.400]  And it's incredible.
[00:35:42.599 --> 00:35:43.840]  So take one pill at first.
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:45.760]  Next little financial energy.
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:48.590]  Also, There are two new great products.
[00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:49.230]  They're just staples.
[00:35:49.329 --> 00:35:50.630]  Everybody knows CoQ10 is amazing.
[00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:55.530]  Everybody knows Corsten's amazing for your heart, your blood sugar, your immune system, your brain.
[00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:57.230]  These go together like a horse and carriage.
[00:35:57.469 --> 00:35:59.250]  Incredible antiviral, antibacterial.
[00:35:59.469 --> 00:36:04.650]  You should take this year-round, but particularly in the winter, this is something you want to take preemptively.
[00:36:04.949 --> 00:36:06.070]  Everybody needs this.
[00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:10.150]  This quality is sold all day for $60 or more in stores.
[00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.369]  This is expensive to get the stuff that's in these.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.539]  40% off right now.
[00:36:14.699 --> 00:36:18.079]  30 bucks for these at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:36:19.099 --> 00:36:22.780]  Everybody needs high quality quercetin and CoQ10.
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:28.219]  Those products and a lot more at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:36:30.039 --> 00:36:37.300]  And I'm, again, we are knocking it out of the park because of your word of mouth and your support when it comes to reaching people.
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.300]  Just the clips alone each day, 70 million people.
[00:36:43.059 --> 00:36:47.679]  The live show, conservatively, 10 million.
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.280]  It's way above that.
[00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:54.800]  I mean, we are dominating right now together, but...
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.800]  And I see it everywhere.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.199]  Everywhere I go, I'm getting mobbed.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.780]  People are incredibly awake.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:00.900]  It's amazing.
[00:37:02.159 --> 00:37:08.440]  So all the globalist attempts to take us off air and the fact that we were stalwarts and stayed on air and the crew put up with this and you stood with us has been amazing.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:08.940]  But now...
[00:37:11.409 --> 00:37:21.769]  We've got to stay on air to get Trump in, to get him inaugurated, and then to stay on the global list and fight them in the huge information war that has just begun.
[00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:27.610]  So, I used the analogy last week and I'll do it again.
[00:37:27.949 --> 00:37:29.769]  And you know NASA, it's not just movies.
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:38.079]  There's been a lot of them about the asteroid coming to destroy the Earth, and we launch a spaceship with nukes to go up and blow it off course or blow it up.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.280]  That's a real program they've had for more than 30 years.
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:42.800]  Actually, an international group works on it.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.219]  And before the new Cold War started, the U.S. was working with Russia on it.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:54.900]  And, you know, you put a ship up into space, it's got nukes on it, and it goes out and blows up the asteroid that's coming towards the Earth.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:38:00.219]  So they see the asteroid, you know, a year out, its trajectory is going to hit Earth, it's 10 miles across.
[00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.550]  Six miles across whatever it is, it's hypothetical.
[00:38:04.329 --> 00:38:16.889]  You get your craft, get it up, load it, have your plan, launch the astronauts, the engineers, or in the future, which is here, it's robotic, but you want to make sure humans are there in case the machines fail.
[00:38:17.389 --> 00:38:22.610]  You go up, we're already landing satellites on comets and asteroids.
[00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.550]  You go, you plant the nukes on it.
[00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:29.389]  The mathematics show how you blow it off trajectory so it doesn't hit the Earth.
[00:38:29.909 --> 00:38:34.809]  The astronauts leave the comet or the asteroid and blow it up.
[00:38:35.849 --> 00:38:40.030]  We saw the asteroid, the globalists, the depopulation operation, the New World Order.
[00:38:41.429 --> 00:38:47.150]  We built the movement to build the ship, to get the crew, to load the weapons, to have the plan.
[00:38:47.429 --> 00:38:52.539]  We successfully launched the Kraft.
[00:38:52.539 --> 00:38:53.719]  We're now in space.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:57.920]  We've now got to get Trump in in the next 69 days into office.
[00:38:58.239 --> 00:39:00.840]  That's rendezvousing with the asteroid or comet.
[00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:03.480]  We get him inaugurated.
[00:39:03.639 --> 00:39:06.059]  We're now on the comet or asteroid.
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:13.780]  And now we've got to plant the bombs, get back on the ship, and then detonate it.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:15.340]  And then that's going to be the process.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.780]  So we launch the ship.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:17.559]  We're in space.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.139]  That's getting Trump elected.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.440]  Now we've got to get to the asteroid.
[00:39:23.199 --> 00:39:24.659]  That's getting him into office.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.579]  Then we blow it up.
[00:39:26.699 --> 00:39:28.239]  And I mean, that is a peaceful analogy.
[00:39:28.239 --> 00:39:29.599]  It's just an explosive analogy.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.380]  I don't mean really blow something up before the media lies.
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:34.059]  Which they do.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.840]  And so the mission's going well.
[00:39:37.119 --> 00:39:37.800]  Cross your fingers.
[00:39:38.019 --> 00:39:38.699]  Stay frosty.
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:39.400]  Stay focused.
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:44.460]  And in the mission to get Trump in and turn this around and blow up the asteroid...
[00:39:45.579 --> 00:39:48.099]  Info Wars is key in the Mission Control.
[00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:49.659]  You're key in that.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.900]  So keep sharing the articles.
[00:39:52.019 --> 00:39:52.739]  Keep sharing the videos.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.780]  Keep doing that.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:54.579]  That's amazing.
[00:39:55.199 --> 00:40:00.239]  And then you've got to keep the mothership alive here at Mission Control.
[00:40:00.539 --> 00:40:01.659]  And the enemy is...
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.320]  Basically drilling in right now.
[00:40:04.739 --> 00:40:08.159]  A very good chance this operation will be blown.
[00:40:08.619 --> 00:40:10.539]  And we've already got the escape ship.
[00:40:10.539 --> 00:40:11.480]  It's already ready.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:17.780]  And as the countdown goes down, if the bad guys do buy this in less than 48 hours...
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.559]  Then we'll know.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.960]  I'll keep broadcasting until they show up.
[00:40:23.019 --> 00:40:24.219]  They said they want to shut it down that day.
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.659]  They'll be here and they're going to come in and they're going to flip a switch in there.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.980]  I'm going to make them do that.
[00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:32.400]  I'm going to stay on the air right to the last minute because we don't quit to the last minute.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.599]  And then I'm going to get in the new ship.
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.280]  I'm going to step into the new ship and continue on.
[00:40:39.119 --> 00:40:43.960]  But the ship is not properly fueled.
[00:40:44.539 --> 00:40:46.860]  It does not have everything done to it it needs.
[00:40:48.019 --> 00:40:51.559]  And so All we've done is deliver victory to you.
[00:40:52.159 --> 00:40:53.280]  And you've delivered it to us.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:53.940]  It's symbiotic.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.099]  We've delivered victory together.
[00:40:57.119 --> 00:40:58.280]  Now is the time.
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:59.639]  I cannot stress enough.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.260]  And if enough funds came in, I'd shut up.
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.780]  You know, they lied to the media and said hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:41:06.019 --> 00:41:08.679]  Remember, then they later said, well, he got audited by outside groups.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:09.360]  He told the truth.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.960]  He had meager funds.
[00:41:11.099 --> 00:41:12.159]  Jones never had that much money.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:12.960]  No kidding.
[00:41:14.409 --> 00:41:17.289]  As if I wouldn't take almost all the money I get.
[00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:21.750]  I still drive a decent car, have a nice house with a pool in the backyard, eat steaks once a week.
[00:41:21.789 --> 00:41:23.230]  I mean, I just don't care about things.
[00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:30.389]  And all I care about is freedom.
[00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:38.949]  And you've invested so much here, it'd be like building a beautiful brand new house and then just burning it down when it's done.
[00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:47.710]  Or having a child you've raised since it was born that you love, and then at 18, just throwing it into a wood chipper.
[00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:51.090]  So, this is history.
[00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:52.670]  I want to thank those that haven't supported.
[00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:54.789]  I want to tell those that haven't supported.
[00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:56.369]  Now is the time.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.460]  It's very frustrating.
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.820]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:02.599]  God's great.
[00:42:02.739 --> 00:42:03.280]  God's good.
[00:42:04.059 --> 00:42:07.539]  You can also go to alexjones.live.
[00:42:07.679 --> 00:42:10.239]  alexjones.live is a subpage at alexjones.network.
[00:42:10.739 --> 00:42:16.380]  And the shopping carts, the sponsors, the Vimeo, the Bitcoin donation buttons there.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.599]  Boy, it'd be nice if somebody go in there and give us some Bitcoin.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.079]  Hell, we got Trump in.
[00:42:20.179 --> 00:42:20.900]  Bitcoin's exploded.
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:24.360]  Why didn't everybody out there that made a bunch of money because Trump got in...
[00:42:25.559 --> 00:42:27.920]  Take part of your profit and help us.
[00:42:28.039 --> 00:42:29.519]  And I'll announce how much came in.
[00:42:29.619 --> 00:42:32.519]  And if we get some big donations, I'll shut up for the next couple of months.
[00:42:32.579 --> 00:42:33.300]  I won't even need money.
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.559]  But I need it right now.
[00:42:36.679 --> 00:42:38.480]  So, that's it.
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:40.320]  Plus the great products.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.320]  Theallshowstore.com, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.159]  Go get one of the posters.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:45.639]  Thank you.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.000]  All right.
[00:42:51.289 --> 00:42:53.769]  I hit a lot of what we're going to get into, maybe a third of it.
[00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:54.690]  And boy, there's a lot.
[00:42:55.230 --> 00:43:01.150]  And I don't have a guest, the head of Rasmussen Polling, to look at the aftermath, what's coming, what the new polls are showing.
[00:43:01.289 --> 00:43:03.289]  The guy's dead on, the most accurate polling agency.
[00:43:03.369 --> 00:43:04.190]  He nailed it.
[00:43:04.869 --> 00:43:10.289]  He said it looks like a Reagan-level victory, the popular and the electoral college.
[00:43:10.289 --> 00:43:10.829]  He was right.
[00:43:10.869 --> 00:43:11.570]  He was right about everything.
[00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:13.670]  That guest is joining us in the third hour.
[00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:18.489]  So I'll have plenty of time from now until then to go over all of this.
[00:43:18.909 --> 00:43:19.750]  I'm going to start now.
[00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:25.050]  And then Owen to look at the other races and how strong is the trifecta.
[00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:26.409]  We can still lose the house.
[00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:28.690]  There's a lot of sneakiness going on.
[00:43:28.889 --> 00:43:29.929]  That's fourth hour.
[00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:36.050]  Because again, the victory is big, but we want to ensure it's as big as possible.
[00:43:36.429 --> 00:43:42.610]  And like I said, and I'll get into this, they're catching them, stealing house races and flipping them back.
[00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:46.630]  And legislative, local races, state races.
[00:43:47.739 --> 00:43:53.079]  So, really good news on that front, but it's not done yet.
[00:43:53.079 --> 00:43:54.840]  There's a lot of House races still undecided.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:03.619]  Alright, I mentioned this, now let me actually drill into it and just sum it up and then show some of the facts.
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:09.360]  Because I don't just tell you, I show you, even if you already know most of this, or probably all of it, there's new listeners who don't, so I'll show you.
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:16.000]  The Democrats are openly not going to give up.
[00:44:16.989 --> 00:44:24.010]  All their top strategists, Raskin, you name it, said that they would not certify Trump.
[00:44:25.789 --> 00:44:30.369]  They said that they'll also get to the electors, even if they don't win the House.
[00:44:31.409 --> 00:44:42.349]  And they said, because Trump's going to commit such incredible crimes against minorities, and he's coming to kill you, that's Harris, all of them, that again, obviously, that's not happening.
[00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:43.429]  Trump's not doing that.
[00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:44.670]  So they're planning...
[00:44:46.849 --> 00:44:53.730]  Some nasty false flags to be blamed on Trump supporters sometime in the next 69 days.
[00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:59.269]  And I say quicker than 69 because they need to do it to get the hysteria and the civil unrest going before.
[00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:08.750]  So the next month, I mean, I'd say, you know, out past a month or so, we go into prime time for false flags.
[00:45:08.929 --> 00:45:10.130]  So we got to be watching for that.
[00:45:11.819 --> 00:45:18.199]  They put out trial balloons all over the place, CNN, ABC News, New York Times, that, oh, the military's very worried about Trump.
[00:45:18.539 --> 00:45:21.340]  They're worried he's going to do bad things, kill people.
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.980]  So the Pentagon's meeting in secret to decide what to do about Trump.
[00:45:26.829 --> 00:45:28.130]  That's a coup being planned.
[00:45:28.429 --> 00:45:29.849]  But they're just trying to normalize it.
[00:45:29.909 --> 00:45:30.510]  Well, he's bad.
[00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:35.730]  So, and Rachel Maddow and all the other surrogates last week said we need to use the military against Trump.
[00:45:35.949 --> 00:45:37.190]  We need uprisings.
[00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:38.190]  We need to be pirates.
[00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:42.630]  We need a violent uprising by black men because Trump's coming to kill you.
[00:45:44.429 --> 00:45:50.969]  That's because the deep state's planning to kill some black men and blame us, the Trump supporters, including black men that are.
[00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:52.929]  I mean, this is really obvious.
[00:45:53.389 --> 00:45:54.429]  This is not hard.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:46:14.739]  Kind of like when I said on July 15th, two days after, I said, you know, they're going to blame Iran for trying to kill Trump on the 13th, and they're going to do it in the future, because then they can blame Iran and launch World War III with them, and use that as the political cover after they killed Trump to try to unify the populace around the government.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:21.420]  And then two days after I said that, they officially came out and pushed it, and now they're pushing it super hard.
[00:46:21.579 --> 00:46:23.920]  So, that's not hard.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.039]  People are like, how the hell did you do that?
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.880]  This is what we do.
[00:46:28.559 --> 00:46:35.960]  And so, another Iranian plot this weekend to kill Trump, foiled by the FBI. And then it turns out, the CIA was behind that as usual.
[00:46:36.079 --> 00:46:38.380]  They're bringing these guys in from Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[00:46:39.039 --> 00:46:43.199]  They think they work for ISIS or the Taliban, and it turns out the CIA is running them.
[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:53.739]  Just like the white supremacist the day before the election that was going to shoot up a black church, or mainly black mall.
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:47:00.380]  And then he didn't do that, so instead he was going to blow up a power station in Tennessee.
[00:47:01.199 --> 00:47:11.880]  And it turned out in the indictment, the FBI was his bosses and the white supremacy leaders that he was following, and they were just trying to get a mentally ill person to go do something.
[00:47:15.279 --> 00:47:16.760]  So, and I predicted that.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:17.840]  That was not hard to predict.
[00:47:18.099 --> 00:47:24.019]  I mean, they said, white supremacist Trump supporters are going to kill black people and blow up power stations, and then sure as hell they catch one doing it the day before.
[00:47:24.119 --> 00:47:25.119]  I mean, come on, people.
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:31.699]  But they're targeting low-information voters, or people that don't even vote that just hear that and believe it.
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:35.920]  Anybody that's got half a brain or pays attention just knows this is all scripted.
[00:47:38.389 --> 00:47:45.230]  And they're also trending at the top of everywhere with no proof that Elon Musk stole the election with satellites and, you know, Harris isn't going to give up.
[00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:47.070]  They've got their surrogates out saying that everywhere.
[00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:54.030]  And they've got, most importantly, New York, Massachusetts, California, and other states.
[00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:56.909]  In fact, I have a clip of this.
[00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:57.730]  Is this on the list?
[00:47:59.259 --> 00:48:03.840]  California is calling an emergency special session to safeguard the fundamental freedoms we hold dear.
[00:48:04.039 --> 00:48:06.119]  We'll continue to stand up for basic American values.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:07.960]  So, you know, that's Governor Newsom.
[00:48:08.159 --> 00:48:09.039]  Do we have that clip on this list?
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.500]  Oh, we do.
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:11.400]  I'll play it in a moment.
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:25.019]  And they're billing it that Trump deporting gangs and human smugglers and drug dealers is a human rights violation and is just, oh, the end of the world.
[00:48:25.679 --> 00:48:28.400]  So even if he gets in, they're already lining up the states.
[00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:34.730]  Criminally, to block a federal jurisdiction.
[00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:36.489]  And the feds have the border.
[00:48:36.909 --> 00:48:38.409]  The feds have non-citizens.
[00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:40.230]  That is a federal jurisdiction.
[00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:44.449]  The Navy is in the Constitution.
[00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:46.429]  The coining of money.
[00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:50.130]  The passing of federal laws.
[00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:51.670]  And the border.
[00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:55.630]  Interstate commerce.
[00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:58.349]  So...
[00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:08.090]  But they know the public, or Democrats at least, are very illiterate when it comes to American governance.
[00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:10.389]  Extremely illiterate.
[00:49:10.929 --> 00:49:19.690]  And so they're banking basically everything, as I said earlier, on Trump's being mean to the poor migrants.
[00:49:21.289 --> 00:49:29.849]  No, they were brought here as refugees from the COVID lockdowns, and they're here to be replacement migrants and to create more Democrat voting districts just by their apportionment and population in the census.
[00:49:30.329 --> 00:49:33.329]  And a bunch of them are voting, and a bunch of them are criminals.
[00:49:33.809 --> 00:49:35.929]  So it's what he pledged to do.
[00:49:35.929 --> 00:49:36.710]  It's the right thing to do.
[00:49:36.769 --> 00:49:37.389]  He needs to do it.
[00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:40.530]  But you've got to be very careful how you do it.
[00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:43.510]  And again, you start by going after the criminals first.
[00:49:43.809 --> 00:49:44.690]  They're all criminals.
[00:49:45.679 --> 00:49:47.280]  Unless their children didn't know what was going on.
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:53.820]  But the hardcore criminals, the rapists, the murderers, the people that Venezuela dumped out of their presence and said, come here.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.039]  That happened all over the world.
[00:49:55.599 --> 00:49:57.400]  The dumping ground Trump talked about.
[00:49:57.579 --> 00:49:59.019]  So you get the military, man.
[00:49:59.139 --> 00:49:59.719]  You get the crooks.
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:00.340]  That's plenty.
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:01.019]  That'll take...
[00:50:01.019 --> 00:50:06.360]  It would take, if it's a huge operation, a year, just to find half of those people.
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.380]  So just do that first.
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.860]  They're the ones committing crimes and robbing and doing the fraud.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:12.420]  Get them.
[00:50:14.699 --> 00:50:20.000]  And, you know, don't just start grabbing women and children, you know, day one.
[00:50:24.159 --> 00:50:29.119]  And so how this would work is, let's say Biden steps down and he dies in his sleep.
[00:50:29.599 --> 00:50:30.500]  Kamala's now the president.
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.139]  They have a huge hype about that.
[00:50:32.679 --> 00:50:35.400]  Low information people think, oh, she's really the president.
[00:50:35.679 --> 00:50:39.500]  Just like she was selected for the nominee.
[00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:41.219]  That's a coup ongoing.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:47.239]  And then they kill Trump, kill Vance, or don't even have to kill him.
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:52.500]  They just say, oh my God, white supremacists, you know, attacked and killed all these migrants.
[00:50:52.699 --> 00:50:53.460]  Oh, it's Trump's fault.
[00:50:53.679 --> 00:50:55.179]  And then burn down half the country.
[00:50:55.599 --> 00:50:59.340]  And then the Democrats just say, Trump's not getting in.
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:00.440]  We've uncertified him.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.659]  And you're like, well, that's unconstitutional.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.699]  Yeah, all this is.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:10.239]  And then that creates total bedlam and we basically have a civil war.
[00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:16.190]  And they're crazy enough to destabilize everything and wreck everything.
[00:51:17.389 --> 00:51:20.110]  Even if they won't win this, they still may do it.
[00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:24.230]  And that's why we've got to admit they're doing it and admit they're programming it and admit they're trying it.
[00:51:25.389 --> 00:51:30.710]  I mean, if you think with 69 days left to go, they're not going to try to kill Trump again.
[00:51:31.849 --> 00:51:45.469]  If you think they're not going to stage some false flags, if you think they're not going to try to crank up some wars, launch a cyber attack, knock the power out, stuff like that, When they pre-programmed it all, then you're naive.
[00:51:46.409 --> 00:51:53.710]  But if they know, we know, and we're watching them, and they already got caught in all this election fraud, there's a good chance they'll stand down.
[00:51:54.170 --> 00:52:01.610]  I'd say about a 60% chance right now they stand down, which would be the smart move.
[00:52:02.489 --> 00:52:14.090]  And then do all their Russia, Russia, Russia, new impeachments they've already got ready and Play the victims and try to sabotage the economy further in the areas they control.
[00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:22.929]  And, you know, file millions of lawsuits against Trump's executive orders and everything else.
[00:52:23.909 --> 00:52:27.289]  But they may just go ahead with the total craziness.
[00:52:27.849 --> 00:52:32.630]  Now, I got a bunch of clips I'm going to get to that are powerful and important illustrating all this.
[00:52:32.789 --> 00:52:37.210]  And then I'm going to shift gears into Trump getting good people in, which is starting to happen.
[00:52:39.059 --> 00:52:39.760]  Geopolitical movements.
[00:52:40.039 --> 00:52:41.599]  Really good announcements by J.D. Vance.
[00:52:41.719 --> 00:52:43.159]  That is exactly what Trump should be doing.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.360]  J.D. Vance warns U.S. may withdraw NATO's support of Europe.
[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:48.280]  Tries to censor social platforms.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.539]  Yeah, that's the U.S. exercising its power to defend America's rights.
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:53.320]  So much more coming up.
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:57.780]  Please follow me at Real Alex Jones on X. And be sure to check out the Alex Jones store.com.
[00:53:08.379 --> 00:53:11.639]  We brought in a lot of money at the AlexJonesStore.com to our sponsor.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:12.880]  And they're great guys.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:13.619]  They're great marketers.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.119]  They're bigly.
[00:53:14.239 --> 00:53:18.639]  They produce the best Trump shirts and are big sponsors for Stephen Crowder and the Hodge twins and so many others.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:21.980]  I had little talks with them though because I see the numbers.
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:25.460]  I'm like, you're selling the CMOS for 55% off.
[00:53:26.119 --> 00:53:28.980]  And then you give VIP members another discount.
[00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:30.300]  And I go, let me see the numbers.
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:34.019]  Oh, actually, some of these deals, we lose money, but we're getting new customers.
[00:53:34.159 --> 00:53:34.559]  They're going to love it.
[00:53:34.579 --> 00:53:42.079]  I'm like, Okay, let's have a couple fundraiser t-shirts that are 50 bucks so we actually, you know, get 20-something bucks.
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:44.539]  You know, after all the cost.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.440]  And I'm not complaining, I'm just saying.
[00:53:46.599 --> 00:53:48.340]  So, I had an idea two weeks ago.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.639]  We'll do a wide shot so you can see these.
[00:53:51.199 --> 00:53:59.599]  And I said, okay, I want a red on black classic InfoWars that says 1776 worldwide 2024, my signature.
[00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:01.010]  Historic.
[00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:01.829]  Looks great in your office.
[00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:02.489]  Great wherever.
[00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:03.489]  You know you support us.
[00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:05.550]  Whatever happens to InfoWars that survives is even cooler.
[00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:06.329]  Doesn't survive.
[00:54:06.449 --> 00:54:07.050]  You've got the memento.
[00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:07.849]  It helps fund the future.
[00:54:08.869 --> 00:54:11.590]  An Alex Jones-style Star Wars fun thing we came up with.
[00:54:11.849 --> 00:54:16.090]  And then the other thing I designed, white on black Infowars lives forever with my signature.
[00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:17.329]  It's right there.
[00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:19.650]  There are only a few thousand of each one of these.
[00:54:19.769 --> 00:54:20.670]  They're limited edition.
[00:54:21.429 --> 00:54:24.389]  This is literally you knowing you back the second American Revolution.
[00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:25.409]  It's such a critical time.
[00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:28.909]  While we've gone over the top, while we have the initiative, while this is all happening.
[00:54:29.409 --> 00:54:34.550]  So these things cost like $5 to print because they are high quality and they're on like a poster boards.
[00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:35.349]  They're thick.
[00:54:35.489 --> 00:54:35.809]  They're nice.
[00:54:35.969 --> 00:54:37.070]  It's like a particularly good movie poster.
[00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:42.690]  And then the tube and all that's like six, seven bucks, eight bucks per unit.
[00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:51.590]  With 50 bucks, you know, we're getting like, you know, they get parved to run their operations, but we're getting 20-something bucks for each poster for the operation.
[00:54:51.829 --> 00:55:00.190]  So if folks just go buy the posters, if people buy them right now, you'll hear me when I come back on Sunday and money, I won't be up here, please, please help me, help me, help me.
[00:55:00.889 --> 00:55:04.230]  If you go get those, we'll have the money and some runway out a few months.
[00:55:05.929 --> 00:55:06.750]  But the legal, everything else.
[00:55:06.889 --> 00:55:09.670]  So if you want to keep the show on the air, this is the action point.
[00:55:10.869 --> 00:55:18.469]  TheAlexJonesStore.com And all the supplements are great, and all the t-shirts are great, and just, you know, everything's amazing.
[00:55:19.409 --> 00:55:29.070]  It's just when they're selling a t-shirt for 25, 30 bucks, and the t-shirt costs $15, or if it's an XXXL, $17, and then they've got their expenses, and their crew, and the legal, and all this stuff, and then we blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:31.449]  Not a lot of money.
[00:55:32.269 --> 00:55:36.190]  So these are the things you get If you really want to support us.
[00:55:36.409 --> 00:55:38.090]  And all the Trump years in, it's amazing.
[00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.710]  Trump won.
[00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:40.449]  These are the best designs out there.
[00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:41.449]  I'm proud of these guys.
[00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:42.849]  I love the work they're doing.
[00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:45.429]  And it's all there.
[00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:49.289]  So the AlexJonesStore.com, three limited edition posters.
[00:55:49.889 --> 00:55:51.670]  I designed the red one and the white one.
[00:55:52.070 --> 00:55:53.550]  I mean, I've literally made those.
[00:55:53.889 --> 00:55:56.510]  And they're simple and they're very strong, very clean.
[00:55:57.429 --> 00:55:59.190]  It's my original design for the Inforge logo.
[00:55:59.969 --> 00:56:01.949]  And then the middle one, I said, why don't we have a Star Wars one?
[00:56:02.469 --> 00:56:08.489]  Kind of a fun thing, you know, for somebody like if you've got a little arcade in your house with video games or pool table or whatever.
[00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:13.030]  I used to have a bigger house, but I don't have a room for a pool table now.
[00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:14.389]  But if I did, I'd be hanging in my house.
[00:56:14.449 --> 00:56:14.849]  That's fun.
[00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:17.750]  And so it's all there.
[00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:18.989]  To me, it's a no-brainer.
[00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:21.230]  I want to thank you respectfully for everything you've done.
[00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:23.570]  I want to thank God for leading, guiding, directing.
[00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:23.969]  It's been incredible.
[00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:29.030]  I want to thank the crew for putting up with me because They understand, but I've been a jerk lately.
[00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.610]  I'll admit it.
[00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:30.409]  I try to repent.
[00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:32.869]  I try to not be so angry, but this is our whole future.
[00:56:32.949 --> 00:56:34.030]  If they get it, they're pissed off too.
[00:56:34.489 --> 00:56:42.829]  They've been busting their ass, and I'd sure like to not just, whether we survive or have to set up a new operation, it'd be nice to give these guys a bonus and maybe a raise.
[00:56:42.929 --> 00:56:47.349]  They haven't had bonuses or raises in over two years, and they're a badass team, so I salute them.
[00:56:47.469 --> 00:56:55.030]  So for all of us here at the InfoWars family, whatever happens, it's all in God's plan, but God works through you, so take action now and be part of the fundraiser.
[00:56:55.170 --> 00:56:56.230]  Get the posters now.
[00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:04.869]  Rising from the ashes of censorship, it's Alex Jones.
[00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:10.610]  All of us together are gonna lift the curse off of this country and we're gonna send the globalists to prison!
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:14.860]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:57:15.139 --> 00:57:18.659]  First they come for Alex Jones, and then they're going to come for us.
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:22.059]  And they try to bankrupt Alex Jones or try to put Alex Jones in prison.
[00:57:22.219 --> 00:57:29.019]  The demonization of Alex Jones should be of profound interest to everybody all across the board, even progressives.
[00:57:29.219 --> 00:57:30.739]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.860]  Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago.
[00:57:34.119 --> 00:57:34.539]  Listen!
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:40.480]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one!
[00:57:46.969 --> 00:57:51.690]  The Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:58:09.929 --> 00:58:13.349]  I can feel freedom rising across the planet.
[00:58:18.949 --> 00:58:21.050]  I can feel human liberty exploding.
[00:58:21.409 --> 00:58:23.929]  I can feel your will.
[00:58:27.369 --> 00:58:30.090]  Evil is in full panic mode right now.
[00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:32.610]  God is real.
[00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:34.170]  God is great.
[00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:38.010]  God is the compendium of the entire universe and beyond.
[00:58:40.969 --> 00:58:42.829]  And I want all of you to hear me now.
[00:58:44.329 --> 00:58:47.750]  The tectonic developments, culturally, spiritually, economically.
[00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:51.050]  Has just begun.
[00:58:53.269 --> 00:59:04.230]  And it is your choice, spiritually now, which side you're going to be on, that will predestine your entire future throughout the universe.
[00:59:05.130 --> 00:59:06.889]  Earth is only the launch point.
[00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:09.690]  The eye has not seen.
[00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:12.670]  The ear has not heard.
[00:59:12.889 --> 00:59:15.510]  The mind has not seen.
[00:59:15.929 --> 00:59:17.389]  It's what God has in store for us.
[00:59:18.949 --> 00:59:19.809]  You can feel it.
[00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:21.309]  You can see it.
[00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:22.510]  You can touch it.
[00:59:22.570 --> 00:59:23.369]  You can taste it.
[00:59:23.610 --> 00:59:25.789]  You know it in your very bones.
[00:59:26.170 --> 00:59:27.610]  The heart of your soul.
[00:59:29.329 --> 00:59:33.809]  Reach out to God and ask God to lead God and direct you.
[00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:36.130]  Ask God to sanctify you.
[00:59:36.449 --> 00:59:38.269]  Ask God to purify you.
[00:59:38.889 --> 00:59:41.889]  Reach out across the time-space continuum.
[00:59:42.289 --> 00:59:51.449]  Make the electrical connection to infinity and transcend Satan, the failed little G God of this world.
[00:59:55.590 --> 00:59:58.989]  In such an incredibly historical time right now.
[00:59:59.650 --> 01:00:04.309]  Yes, these are the times that try men's souls.
[01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:13.250]  But it is the trying of the soul that makes us face reality and become what we really should be.
[01:00:27.309 --> 01:00:31.389]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:44.769 --> 01:00:52.570]  We are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
[01:00:56.989 --> 01:01:00.590]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:03.369]  This is the heart of 1776.
[01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:08.809]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[01:01:08.969 --> 01:01:15.610]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[01:01:20.869 --> 01:01:26.909]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:32.289]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:35.090]  Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States.
[01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:41.730]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[01:01:41.989 --> 01:01:46.590]  From the front lines of the info room, it's Alex Jones.
[01:01:46.929 --> 01:01:49.929]  Alright, in the first hour I laid out the big picture.
[01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:57.769]  Now I'm going to drill into all the news and how it ties together and where we are as a species on this planet.
[01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:13.110]  But the deep state is still plotting to install Harris and create triggering events as the pretext for them to create massive civil unrest coupled with cyber attacks, power outages, expanded war.
[01:02:13.369 --> 01:02:14.030]  It's all on the table.
[01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:16.329]  We have to get ahead of it.
[01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:18.710]  And that's what we do here.
[01:02:18.809 --> 01:02:19.670]  We raise the alarm.
[01:02:20.489 --> 01:02:21.889]  We are all Paul Revere's.
[01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:24.050]  Not just this show, it's you.
[01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:31.949]  You're the reason we're reaching 80 million people a day right now.
[01:02:34.949 --> 01:02:35.690]  That's happening.
[01:02:35.889 --> 01:02:36.690]  That's a conservative number.
[01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:38.349]  That's you.
[01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:41.349]  So I want to just sit back for a moment.
[01:02:42.519 --> 01:02:46.139]  And take stock of the fact that you are realizing that you are the resistance.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.820]  You have the power.
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:49.980]  You're exercising your power.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.219]  You're admitting how much trouble we were in.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:57.000]  Not to be losers, not to give up, but to say we're going to dig our way out of this.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:04.480]  Just like when you're out driving around the countryside and driving through a creek bottom and you're four by four stuck in a creek.
[01:03:05.159 --> 01:03:06.980]  And you and your buddies get out of the car.
[01:03:07.139 --> 01:03:08.320]  Maybe you're by yourself and you...
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:09.760]  Get the shovels out.
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:11.260]  You put gravel down under the tires.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.260]  Maybe it takes you an hour, two hours to get out of there.
[01:03:14.019 --> 01:03:16.320]  You tie the winch up to a tree and get out in five minutes.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.340]  It's satisfying to get that truck out of there.
[01:03:20.179 --> 01:03:21.460]  Well, that's what we're doing.
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:23.980]  And the wheels are turning and we're pulling out.
[01:03:24.119 --> 01:03:25.400]  We're getting out of the mud right now.
[01:03:26.199 --> 01:03:27.239]  But we're not out yet.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.960]  We've won the big battle.
[01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:31.039]  Now we've got to win the war.
[01:03:32.579 --> 01:03:34.699]  So let me go through what they're doing.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:42.739]  They're everywhere discrediting saying that or trying to discredit saying Elon Musk stole it with satellites and the Lucky Charms leprechaun.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.860]  They're promising all this violence.
[01:03:46.079 --> 01:03:46.800]  We're Hitler.
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:47.920]  We're coming to get them.
[01:03:48.019 --> 01:03:48.960]  So they've got to be violent.
[01:03:49.239 --> 01:03:51.260]  Oh, Kamala needs to replace Biden.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.079]  So it's more legitimate if they kill Trump or when they trigger the civil unrest.
[01:03:55.559 --> 01:03:57.159]  They're still saying they're not going to certify.
[01:03:57.179 --> 01:03:58.579]  We still haven't won the House.
[01:03:59.139 --> 01:04:00.800]  Those seats are still contested.
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:03.019]  If they get the House, they're not going to certify Trump.
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.619]  Even if they don't get the House, they're going to try to not do it.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:13.559]  They are going to pull some major shenanigans in the next 69 days.
[01:04:15.909 --> 01:04:19.929]  Unless there's such a spotlight on them that they get cold feet.
[01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:23.030]  And I'm seeing major signs of that everywhere.
[01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:24.050]  I mean, here's just one example.
[01:04:27.409 --> 01:04:28.710]  Michael Douglas comes out.
[01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:30.969]  And guys, I had the full report earlier.
[01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:32.190]  You actually print me the Breitbart article.
[01:04:32.289 --> 01:04:32.510]  Thank you.
[01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:36.929]  Michael Douglas admits Republicans under Trump are now party of the people.
[01:04:37.409 --> 01:04:38.170]  That's a quote.
[01:04:38.369 --> 01:04:39.869]  While Democrats are the elitist.
[01:04:44.359 --> 01:04:48.300]  The establishment's known they've been dead for a long time.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.400]  But now they're realizing no matter what they do, they're going to fail.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:07.300]  And at any point in history like this, you need to have a negotiation with the establishment and say, if you capitulate and you back down, we'll go easy on you.
[01:05:10.919 --> 01:05:14.099]  Because obviously, they could really screw some stuff up right now.
[01:05:15.139 --> 01:05:19.260]  And you have to explain to them, no matter what you pull, it doesn't end well for you.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:26.719]  But we really would like to avert a lot of pain and suffering and death.
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:32.179]  And so, you need to roll over like Zuckerberg did four months ago.
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:34.059]  Like we told him he should.
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.340]  And you're seeing a lot of other people roll over right now.
[01:05:38.659 --> 01:05:57.840]  That said, there are a lot of clips out there that already played in the last few days where they're saying all this and calling for violence and saying they're not going to certify and that military needs to be used against Trump and Trump supporters to stop his coup because he's coming to enslave us all with tyranny if we don't overthrow the election with tyranny.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:07.550]  But I saw a clip from the Disrespected trucker, but he didn't upload this.
[01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:08.829]  It says, unknown trucker.
[01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:18.269]  Do you agree with this man's prediction of the election and what he thinks will happen?
[01:06:18.449 --> 01:06:19.489]  And I checked it.
[01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:23.369]  This was uploaded a couple days before the election last week.
[01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:24.730]  It was Sunday.
[01:06:25.809 --> 01:06:26.969]  And what this...
[01:06:28.659 --> 01:06:30.820]  Trucker, identified trucker, says...
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.480]  I won't get him on the show.
[01:06:32.199 --> 01:06:35.460]  He'll private message me on X or something or reach out to us or email us.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:41.500]  What he says in just a few minutes is exactly what I've been saying.
[01:06:43.019 --> 01:06:44.360]  And I said it.
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:45.500]  Roger Stone said it before.
[01:06:46.039 --> 01:06:49.460]  Now they're openly saying they want to put Kamala in and have Biden step down.
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.360]  And now they're doing it.
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.420]  Her chief strategist, her spokesman...
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.780]  People say, oh, that's just a fantasy.
[01:06:57.039 --> 01:06:59.320]  No, they're not saying that unless they're going to try it.
[01:06:59.639 --> 01:07:05.500]  We already said they're going to make Biden step down and kill him if they have to and put Harris in, and they did that.
[01:07:05.599 --> 01:07:06.639]  He had a medical emergency.
[01:07:06.639 --> 01:07:07.400]  They didn't kill him.
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:10.360]  So that's a coup.
[01:07:10.539 --> 01:07:13.480]  The coup is ongoing for another 69 days, as I've said a thousand times.
[01:07:14.219 --> 01:07:21.460]  So we need to admit these guys are desperate, admit they're criminals, and admit they'll do anything they think they can get away with.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:22.219]  So here's the clip.
[01:07:25.409 --> 01:07:29.750]  Good morning, all my AFF family members and all my MAGA brothers and sisters.
[01:07:31.949 --> 01:07:35.570]  Something I want to talk about, something I want to tell you guys.
[01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:44.730]  I believe on Wednesday morning when we wake up, the world will be a vastly different place.
[01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:49.030]  I believe Donald Trump is going to win this election by a landslide.
[01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:51.469]  I believe he's going to win at least 45 states.
[01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:53.659]  Excuse me.
[01:07:54.079 --> 01:07:55.059]  It's going to be a massacre.
[01:07:57.239 --> 01:08:01.860]  I also believe Kamala Harris is going to refuse to leave office.
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:13.820]  You see, they've allowed these whiny little bitches to take pot shots at Donald Trump so they can have some scumbag that they can blame it on and not be connected to.
[01:08:15.139 --> 01:08:21.300]  Camelto is not going to leave office because the people who own her are not going to allow it.
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:26.460]  So sometime in this lame duck period, you're gonna see her be sworn in as president.
[01:08:27.619 --> 01:08:32.539]  That is going to happen after she loses this election.
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:36.300]  And then what's going to happen is they're gonna call in a professional.
[01:08:37.119 --> 01:08:38.579]  They're tired of playing games.
[01:08:38.979 --> 01:08:41.720]  They know after they lose the election, they have no other choice.
[01:08:42.199 --> 01:08:43.760]  They're gonna call in a professional.
[01:08:44.079 --> 01:08:45.899]  Donald Trump will be assassinated.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:57.329]  And because of that, she will then declare martial law And then have the election be null and void so that she can stay in power.
[01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:01.930]  That is what's going to happen.
[01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:09.210]  Donald Trump will not keep himself safe after he wins this election.
[01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:11.729]  He will be out there doing what he does.
[01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:15.529]  And he will be out there and he will be talking to the people.
[01:09:16.210 --> 01:09:20.630]  And the people who own Kamala will bring in a professional and they will take him out.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.039]  They will finally do it because they have no choice.
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.199]  And then she declares martial law.
[01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:27.479]  There is no election.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:28.899]  She stays in power.
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:38.000]  I hope somebody can convince Donald Trump once he wins this election to stay home and stay safe.
[01:09:40.279 --> 01:09:45.220]  Because during that lame duck period, there will be a professional out there looking for him to take him out.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:47.340]  And if they get a chance, they will do it.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.439]  They will succeed because it will be a pro.
[01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:52.760]  So please, Mr.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:56.979]  President, once you win this election, you don't fucking landslide.
[01:09:57.739 --> 01:09:59.079]  Keep yourself safe.
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:00.720]  Stay home.
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.319]  Handpick your own security detail.
[01:10:04.119 --> 01:10:08.319]  Make sure that you make it to be sworn in as president.
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:12.159]  This world will not survive if you do not.
[01:10:12.779 --> 01:10:19.159]  The world will never recover from you not becoming our next president.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.300]  So please, please, Mr.
[01:10:22.439 --> 01:10:25.359]  President, please keep yourself safe.
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.500]  I'm begging you, please.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:29.659]  All right, we found him.
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:33.380]  He's Willis Farrar, F-A-R-A-R-3.
[01:10:33.659 --> 01:10:37.039]  Get him on and get more of his videos.
[01:10:37.119 --> 01:10:38.979]  Let's see what he's saying now after the election.
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:40.460]  That guy knows what he's talking about.
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:41.359]  So he nailed it.
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.520]  And I don't care if you're a truck driver.
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:46.539]  I don't care if you're a doctor.
[01:10:46.539 --> 01:10:49.000]  I don't care if you're black, white, old, young, Hispanic.
[01:10:50.610 --> 01:10:53.189]  If you've got a history of being right, that's who we have on the show.
[01:10:53.329 --> 01:10:54.529]  We have economists on that are right.
[01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:56.550]  We have political analysts on that are right.
[01:10:56.710 --> 01:10:58.350]  We have scientists on that are right.
[01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:01.010]  There's a lot of people that know what's going on.
[01:11:01.369 --> 01:11:09.609]  The corporate media is there to gaslight you and make you think that upside down, the world is real.
[01:11:11.069 --> 01:11:15.550]  And absolutely, Trump did up his security since they tried to kill him twice.
[01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:17.149]  He did stop playing golf.
[01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:24.460]  And If he thinks he can tell people like Lindsey Graham, oh I'm going to play golf today, you want to go?
[01:11:24.699 --> 01:11:26.560]  And then somebody's waiting for him to kill him.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.439]  You know the deep state's got all Trump's phones tapped.
[01:11:31.539 --> 01:11:33.220]  I was the first report on that eight years ago.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:46.079]  Because the DEA had access to the NSA database and gave Sheriff Joe Arpaio the documents and I was on the list.
[01:11:46.819 --> 01:11:49.840]  And it was a home number that I forgot I even had still connected.
[01:11:50.899 --> 01:11:52.659]  That I use for a fax machine.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.439]  It was all my numbers.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.140]  My old cell phone numbers, everything.
[01:11:55.859 --> 01:11:58.180]  And it was just an ongoing dragnet.
[01:11:58.359 --> 01:12:03.220]  And remember, even this year, Dan Bongino got similar documents and said, yeah, Alex Jones is on the list too.
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:05.359]  They got people listening to me.
[01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:07.899]  Not just they're recording everything I say and they have a database.
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:10.140]  No, I have people listening to everything I say.
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:15.720]  I mean, folks, I was covering Bilderbergs.
[01:12:17.279 --> 01:12:19.159]  Was it like 15 years ago at Chantilly?
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.720]  And I just exposed a bunch of them.
[01:12:22.539 --> 01:12:34.460]  And I go on my phone to make a phone call and they break in over the call while I'm driving down the road to a restaurant to eat because we've been covering Bilderberg all day.
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:37.520]  And they were like, listen, you son of a sort of cuss.
[01:12:37.539 --> 01:12:40.079]  We're going to cut you and your family's heads off if you don't stop doing this.
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:49.039]  And then we noticed a guy was following us in a car, so we slammed on the brakes, got in his face, he ran off, and I was like, start cutting heads off, better start.
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:13:05.560]  But that's what these guys do, and they had, at the hotel we were standing a few miles away, we'd get on the elevator, and the two big guys would get on, and they'd start like kind of putting their shoulders into us, say, are you playing anything violent,
[01:13:05.739 --> 01:13:05.960]  Alex?
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:08.479]  What you playing in?
[01:13:11.210 --> 01:13:13.029]  And I'm like, oh, who are you with?
[01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:14.670]  Let me guess, the State Department.
[01:13:14.829 --> 01:13:15.529]  And they start freaking out.
[01:13:15.789 --> 01:13:17.069]  Well, why do you say that?
[01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:19.930]  Because I know the State Department runs the extra security for Bilderberg.
[01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:25.590]  Let me guess, you're Marine Corps officers, and I just know this stuff, and you're here to intimidate me.
[01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:28.529]  And the guys start literally going, and I was like, yeah.
[01:13:28.810 --> 01:13:32.170]  I said, well, if you're going to kick me, they were big, big guys, but like, you know, 55-year-old men.
[01:13:32.409 --> 01:13:33.170]  I said, well, you're going to hurt me.
[01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:33.770]  Go ahead and do it.
[01:13:33.829 --> 01:13:34.909]  Let's see how that works out for you.
[01:13:36.170 --> 01:13:38.149]  And they basically crapped their britches.
[01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:43.189]  Like, I didn't know the Marines were there.
[01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:44.229]  Oh, I'm so scared.
[01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:47.050]  Oh, I'm a bad American exposing secret globalist meetings.
[01:13:47.069 --> 01:13:47.850]  I'm the bad guy.
[01:13:47.989 --> 01:13:49.329]  Oh, you've intimidated the bad?
[01:13:49.449 --> 01:13:50.529]  No, you're going to cut my head off.
[01:13:50.609 --> 01:13:51.529]  Oh, no, don't do that.
[01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:53.930]  Oh, I didn't know I was up against evil people.
[01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.210]  I didn't know my life was in danger.
[01:13:55.329 --> 01:13:55.810]  I better go.
[01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:57.229]  I love how they threaten me.
[01:13:57.329 --> 01:13:58.149]  Like, I don't already know.
[01:13:59.869 --> 01:14:02.449]  You understand, I'm fully committed to this.
[01:14:03.630 --> 01:14:05.409]  I know how dangerous it is.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.560]  And that makes me strong because I am committed.
[01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.439]  I don't care what you do.
[01:14:12.739 --> 01:14:15.680]  And my family's dead already if the new order comes in.
[01:14:15.899 --> 01:14:18.119]  Poison shots, GMO, global government.
[01:14:19.479 --> 01:14:21.119]  You can't threaten my family.
[01:14:21.279 --> 01:14:22.300]  You can't threaten me.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.560]  My family knows what's going on.
[01:14:24.699 --> 01:14:27.739]  My parents, they've harassed my parents for two years horribly.
[01:14:28.979 --> 01:14:31.119]  My parents didn't even tell me about most of it.
[01:14:32.159 --> 01:14:34.039]  Sued to live in hell out of the Democratic Party.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:35.760]  Basically bankrupted them.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.420]  Just made my parents ten times more hardcore.
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:41.520]  And all they said is, we just want you to win and fight harder.
[01:14:41.819 --> 01:14:46.039]  My mother said, like, six, eight months ago, I told her, she said, she said, come home with your shield on it.
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:47.340]  I want you to go after these people.
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:49.859]  I'm like, I am going after them.
[01:14:49.939 --> 01:14:50.960]  She goes, yeah, you're eating too much.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:51.699]  You don't look healthy.
[01:14:52.199 --> 01:14:53.640]  I want you to get your ass in shape.
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:54.300]  This is a war.
[01:14:54.699 --> 01:14:56.060]  I was like, okay.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:57.899]  And it was the final straw.
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:58.899]  You saw me start getting in shape.
[01:15:00.579 --> 01:15:02.079]  My mother looked at me and said, this is a war.
[01:15:02.159 --> 01:15:03.039]  I expect you to go all...
[01:15:03.039 --> 01:15:04.500]  My mother's never been like that in my whole life.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:05.340]  She's a sweet person.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.920]  Like, leave it to Bieber's mother or something.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.159]  Until, you know, you see who your mom really is.
[01:15:16.399 --> 01:15:18.640]  Because we're in a war, people.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:25.359]  And they mess with the wrong folks.
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.159]  They mess with you.
[01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:27.579]  They think you're cowards.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:28.239]  They think you're weak.
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.239]  As I've said a hundred times, it's so important.
[01:15:30.479 --> 01:15:32.560]  The globalists thought you were intimidated.
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.779]  All these years they were intimidating and persecuting.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.039]  People were asleep.
[01:15:37.449 --> 01:15:48.250]  Now that we're awake and you're hurting us, people don't, in almost every case, like being pushed around, like being attacked, like being bullied.
[01:15:49.090 --> 01:15:53.810]  And they might ride up front back off for a minute, but they're going to go home and think about how they're going to get you.
[01:15:56.170 --> 01:15:58.390]  I think everybody's just like me, and you know what?
[01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:08.649]  We're proving that my gut-level feeling about America and people of the world in general, but particularly America, I was right.
[01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:11.510]  That I thought you were just like me.
[01:16:11.770 --> 01:16:12.670]  I bet on you.
[01:16:12.789 --> 01:16:13.210]  And you know what?
[01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:13.869]  I bet right.
[01:16:16.329 --> 01:16:25.529]  Now that we're at the most successful point together, this Infowars family we've ever been, it's so fitting that I'm probably going to get shut down in two days.
[01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:27.350]  I think bad guys will probably overbid and shut us down.
[01:16:28.569 --> 01:16:31.409]  They'll run around and act all victorious, all the rest of it.
[01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:33.229]  That's just emblematic of the tyranny.
[01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:34.909]  Will you back me?
[01:16:35.029 --> 01:16:36.050]  Will you find where we are?
[01:16:36.170 --> 01:16:37.090]  Will you support us then?
[01:16:38.369 --> 01:16:39.289]  Because this is a long fight.
[01:16:39.810 --> 01:16:43.210]  And if people think the fight's done, you're fools.
[01:16:44.489 --> 01:16:46.189]  But I know you're just like me.
[01:16:47.689 --> 01:16:51.949]  And quite frankly, I don't want us to get shut down because they'll see it as a victory and I don't quit.
[01:16:52.409 --> 01:16:55.050]  That's why I'm going to fight right to the last minute with everything I got.
[01:16:55.449 --> 01:16:59.050]  But if they do and we just don't give up, it'll just make the show bigger.
[01:17:03.109 --> 01:17:05.229]  Because this is a long fight.
[01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:08.609]  And I've hit my second wind.
[01:17:10.029 --> 01:17:14.109]  And I'm on cloud nine, quite frankly.
[01:17:15.409 --> 01:17:18.289]  But I can't take that and say, well, everything's okay then.
[01:17:18.369 --> 01:17:20.329]  No, I've got to secure the victory.
[01:17:20.329 --> 01:17:23.670]  You've got to secure the victory because it's so incredibly precious.
[01:17:27.829 --> 01:17:30.409]  But Trump victory...
[01:17:32.689 --> 01:17:36.609]  At a governance level is a giant global earthquake against tyranny.
[01:17:36.869 --> 01:17:58.770]  But the fact that we overrode the intimidation, the fraud, the lies, the bullying, the lawfare, the criminal attacks on us, the fact that you did that, and that record numbers of Americans of all race, colors, and creeds came together, that's the victory that we got our soul back to a great extent.
[01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:02.899]  America's soul is re-entering the body right now.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:07.279]  And that's why the awakening is so explosive.
[01:18:07.279 --> 01:18:08.220]  It's accelerated.
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.979]  It's awe-inspiring.
[01:18:09.979 --> 01:18:11.960]  It's not even started, basically.
[01:18:12.899 --> 01:18:18.359]  It's like watching a Falcon Heavy blast off from Cape Canaveral in Florida.
[01:18:20.199 --> 01:18:22.680]  Biggest rocket in the world by far.
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.319]  And it starts off real slow.
[01:18:25.539 --> 01:18:30.060]  And then it just starts accelerating, accelerating, accelerating, till it's going thousands of miles an hour.
[01:18:31.979 --> 01:18:40.420]  Starts off and right now, the rocket's at about 2,000 feet.
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:46.119]  It's going about 200 miles an hour.
[01:18:47.659 --> 01:18:54.199]  It's going to be going 2,000 miles an hour and 3,000 miles an hour real fast.
[01:18:54.819 --> 01:18:57.119]  And the astronauts are slammed back in their seats.
[01:19:02.779 --> 01:19:04.880]  Unexpressed elevator to Valhalla.
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:12.060]  So if you think we're moving quick right now, baby...
[01:19:13.739 --> 01:19:15.020]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:26.939]  If we take this initiative we've got and put our heads down like a rhinoceros plow forward, anything's possible.
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:34.840]  So, that's where we're at.
[01:19:35.819 --> 01:19:47.550]  And you've got this Christianoid fake That everything is predestined.
[01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:54.670]  And so the world's going to end and the Antichrist is going to take over.
[01:19:55.170 --> 01:20:00.750]  And because we see all these signs of the Antichrist and the world government, the Catholic society, that it's going to happen now.
[01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:07.310]  No, if you look at the Bible, Old Testament and New, It's the same story, and they've dug all this stuff up now.
[01:20:07.569 --> 01:20:08.989]  It's all happened.
[01:20:09.170 --> 01:20:12.630]  They keep finding everything the Bible says is there, down to the exact details.
[01:20:13.289 --> 01:20:19.770]  They just found a few months ago an altar that Samuel did at an exact spot with the exact carvings in aluminum.
[01:20:27.649 --> 01:20:36.289]  And they dug up where All these cities exactly where the Bible said they were, they couldn't find until now.
[01:20:37.229 --> 01:20:43.229]  And they also are finding all these cities that Plato said were certain spots.
[01:20:43.289 --> 01:20:44.289]  They thought he just made it up.
[01:20:44.369 --> 01:20:45.090]  Now they're finding those.
[01:20:45.869 --> 01:20:51.029]  But the point is, the Bible says there are many antichrists.
[01:20:51.789 --> 01:20:54.689]  And the devil tries the same thing over and over again.
[01:20:54.829 --> 01:20:58.289]  He doesn't get it until the very last time.
[01:20:58.289 --> 01:21:00.270]  He only gets it for a short period, a few years.
[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:11.420]  And so, the whole Bible is, God says to Jonah, go to this city as a prophet and preach to them to repent, or they'll be destroyed.
[01:21:14.699 --> 01:21:19.720]  And he tries to not do what God said, and then God, you know, basically makes him go there.
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:30.819]  And then they actually listen, and Nineveh gets a 100-year reprieve, and then gets destroyed by a giant earthquake and a bunch of stuff, and then they dug it up, and it happened just like the Bible says.
[01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:51.220]  But the point is that over and over again, God has made things predestined Because God knows the outcome of our free will,
[01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:53.260]  but it's like choose your adventure books.
[01:21:53.359 --> 01:22:03.560]  There's all these different futures that God has already predestined and knows what we're going to do and gave us free will, but we then still choose that path within that compendium.
[01:22:06.319 --> 01:22:08.800]  And so the church tells you, oh, just hide in the church.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:09.520]  It's the end of the world.
[01:22:09.619 --> 01:22:10.619]  Praise God, it's getting bad.
[01:22:10.739 --> 01:22:12.140]  That means Jesus comes soon.
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:28.890]  And that whole rapture story A five-year-old could read Revelation and it says after the devil is bound, after Satan is defeated, after the archangel ties a chain around him,
[01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:37.750]  that the dead in Christ are risen, given heavenly bodies.
[01:22:38.210 --> 01:22:40.050]  They join us.
[01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:55.770]  And then there's a thousand year rule of Christ on earth and then God lets the devil out again after all the proof we've seen and he deceives a bunch of people again.
[01:22:56.750 --> 01:23:03.590]  And then God goes, this real simulation is over and rolls the universe up like a scroll.
[01:23:06.090 --> 01:23:17.369]  And he's got his people And the devil's got his, and this whole universe, this whole thing that was just for us to experience what's going to happen is gone.
[01:23:20.210 --> 01:23:22.029]  This is just the test level.
[01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:25.409]  This is the war game.
[01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:28.329]  You are an ethereal energy being.
[01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:30.609]  You are eternal.
[01:23:32.050 --> 01:23:35.090]  From the moment God made you before he put you in your mother's womb.
[01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:41.579]  Your cells are just an energetic imprint of your spirit energy.
[01:23:41.819 --> 01:23:44.000]  And now the scientists know that and are freaking out.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.779]  The DNA is an electrochemical transceiver.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:55.560]  And so, oh, the Antichrist will come, world government, all that stuff.
[01:23:55.659 --> 01:23:57.880]  But it could be in 100 years.
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:58.720]  It could be in 200.
[01:23:59.039 --> 01:24:00.300]  It's all in God's plan.
[01:24:01.359 --> 01:24:04.880]  We don't have to let the devil take over right now.
[01:24:06.859 --> 01:24:10.199]  We're supposed to fight evil regardless and occupy the earth.
[01:24:10.859 --> 01:24:12.479]  All right, I'm gonna hit all the news when we come back.
[01:24:12.579 --> 01:24:12.960]  Stay with us.
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:20.079]  I respectfully ask you to pay attention to what I'm about to say because it is critical in three important ways.
[01:24:20.319 --> 01:24:22.699]  It'll keep my broadcast on the air.
[01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:31.000]  It will get you the highest quality, amazing CBD. It's so good for your whole body, inflammation, joints.
[01:24:31.609 --> 01:24:35.350]  You name it, and you're getting the best deal you're going to find anywhere.
[01:24:35.649 --> 01:24:38.569]  I've been promoting and selling CBD for more than 20 years.
[01:24:38.770 --> 01:24:43.010]  Everybody knows how amazing it is, but not all CBD is equal.
[01:24:43.529 --> 01:24:56.409]  This is a high quality, made in Texas, very strong CBD, thousand milligram tincture that has been put in nanoparticles, so it's eight to nine times stronger than regular CBD that already gives you great effects.
[01:24:57.229 --> 01:25:07.010]  On top of that, we private label it from a top company that sells it to a bunch of other companies that sell it from between $140 to $90 to $76.
[01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:13.890]  This is the lowest price you're going to find on CBD of this quality anywhere in the market.
[01:25:14.289 --> 01:25:16.869]  The industry just massively marks it up.
[01:25:17.050 --> 01:25:25.149]  There's still some good margin in here for our sponsor to support their operation and support us, and then that savings is passed on to you.
[01:25:25.229 --> 01:25:31.949]  So if you want to get great CBD and keep the broadcast on air, visit jonescbd.com.
[01:25:34.770 --> 01:25:40.909]  Let me tell you the names of these products, Ultra Green, because it's amazing, and Dreamwave.
[01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:44.329]  You want to get both of these and it supports the broadcast.
[01:25:44.329 --> 01:25:54.029]  You will not be disappointed, particularly if you're already into CBD and you take this that costs a third or half of what you're paying and you get a great response.
[01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:55.319]  I know you're going to love it.

[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:20.220]  Alright, President Trump is pledging to abolish the Department of Education and send it back to the states just like he did with Roe v.
[01:26:20.359 --> 01:26:20.640]  Wade.
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:21.560]  Promise to do that.
[01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:23.689]  We're going to get to a clip of that.
[01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:24.210]  That's huge.
[01:26:24.449 --> 01:26:31.310]  Also, Trump to appoint Stephen Miller, who's super smart and awesome, the deporter, as deputy chief of staff.
[01:26:32.029 --> 01:26:34.590]  That is some really, really good news there.
[01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:36.229]  I've got a ton of other news I want to plow through.
[01:26:38.250 --> 01:26:41.109]  And then I want to get back into how they're planning to remove Trump.
[01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:42.850]  They're going to have the states block his agenda.
[01:26:43.409 --> 01:26:45.149]  They're going to try to decertify him.
[01:26:46.590 --> 01:26:58.029]  Also, Coming up on the 26th of November, the judge is signaling there's a good chance he's going to order Trump to report to four years in prison.
[01:26:58.289 --> 01:27:05.390]  Funny, it's the exact time, and a president cannot pardon himself from a state conviction.
[01:27:06.729 --> 01:27:21.920]  That's going to create a constitutional crisis, and knowing the deep state, they're probably crazy enough on the 26th That's just 15 days away to do this.
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:23.939]  So we need to look at that.
[01:27:25.199 --> 01:27:26.960]  And yeah, they'll go in the face of a mandate.
[01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:28.420]  They'll go in the face of a trifecta.
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.680]  They'll go in the face of a landslide.
[01:27:31.939 --> 01:27:42.600]  I'm not predicting they'll do it, but if you go off their past behavior, they will order Trump to report to prison on the 26th.
[01:27:45.779 --> 01:27:53.180]  So At that point, Trump needs to say, this is a fraudulent, this is garbage.
[01:27:53.899 --> 01:27:56.439]  Even mainline scholars admitted the case was a total fraud.
[01:28:02.659 --> 01:28:03.840]  That's a whole other question.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:05.779]  What does Trump do about that?
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:09.840]  Meanwhile, you've got leftist women saying, let's wear a mask.
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:12.100]  Let's cut our hair off.
[01:28:13.130 --> 01:28:15.329]  To show that we know we're under tyranny.
[01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:16.789]  You're the ones in the cult.
[01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:19.850]  That's like Charlie Manson's cult, the women shave their heads.
[01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:26.289]  They literally worship the system, the establishment, and believe they're the underdogs.
[01:28:26.489 --> 01:28:28.069]  They believe they're the mavericks.
[01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:36.189]  When they follow the directives of the WEF and Bill Gates through the corporate media, and you've got other women running around saying, oh no.
[01:28:38.829 --> 01:28:41.149]  Kamala Harris isn't giving up.
[01:28:41.289 --> 01:28:42.350]  She's going to stay in office.
[01:28:42.630 --> 01:28:44.310]  So that's what they believe.
[01:28:44.789 --> 01:28:57.970]  And now they believe when she's repudiating the landslide that she deserves to be made the president because she's a woman and Biden, who they say was elected, he wasn't really either, but at least on paper he was, that it's his job to step down because she's a woman.
[01:28:58.170 --> 01:29:01.250]  Look at how totalitarian and arrogant that is.
[01:29:01.689 --> 01:29:03.069]  Here's both the clips back to back.
[01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:12.970]  Okay, that whole Kamala speech that we heard, where she basically said, we always win, sometimes the fight takes longer.
[01:29:13.689 --> 01:29:21.770]  It gives off the same vibes as sometimes people will close the door on you and then you just gotta kick that fucker down.
[01:29:22.329 --> 01:29:24.489]  I think that's what she's doing right now.
[01:29:24.909 --> 01:29:26.710]  She's kicking that fucker down.
[01:29:26.989 --> 01:29:35.600]  And that's why she's so damn quiet, because they're in there going, wait a minute, We're seeing all these people saying, my vote isn't counted.
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:47.479]  They're going through and saying, what are all these people that I see that they voted in every single damn election, right down to dog catcher, but for some reason they didn't vote in this election.
[01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:52.229]  And what about the return of mail-in ballots?
[01:29:52.590 --> 01:29:56.489]  It's usually 10% in this state don't return their mail-in ballots.
[01:29:56.670 --> 01:30:02.329]  But for some reason, this election, it's 30% of people that didn't return their ballots.
[01:30:02.609 --> 01:30:04.109]  And you know what she's gonna do?
[01:30:04.289 --> 01:30:12.770]  She's gonna go to court with actual evidence because she's a lawyer instead of, trust me, bro, they're broken.
[01:30:13.890 --> 01:30:15.350]  And we're getting our election back.
[01:30:15.529 --> 01:30:17.430]  We're taking our country back.
[01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:18.850]  I truly believe that.
[01:30:19.029 --> 01:30:26.729]  And I also believe that that's why we are all very upset about this, but we're like, our guts are calm.
[01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:34.189]  We know inside of our guts that this is not what reality is.
[01:30:34.369 --> 01:30:41.470]  We know that there's something fishy going on and we're just, We're getting it back.
[01:30:41.729 --> 01:30:43.409]  I can just feel it in my bones.
[01:30:43.630 --> 01:30:49.750]  It's, you know, give it a couple of weeks and we're gonna end up, you know, there's gonna be some announcement or something.
[01:30:50.029 --> 01:31:03.789]  Hey, everybody that didn't have their ballot counted, if you are in your state and you didn't have your ballot counted, you go to vote.org, you can come in and cast a ballot if it's already not counted.
[01:31:03.949 --> 01:31:05.489]  I mean, something like that's gonna happen.
[01:31:05.770 --> 01:31:06.470]  Just watch.
[01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:08.270]  She's kicking that fucking door down.
[01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:17.689]  And most effective form of protest you have right now, that you can start immediately, put a mask back on.
[01:31:19.069 --> 01:31:27.409]  Stop letting them observe your face and have the side benefit of better health and protecting the rest of us in the world.
[01:31:27.729 --> 01:31:28.649]  What a cult!
[01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:30.609]  Put a mask back on.
[01:31:32.069 --> 01:31:33.050]  Fuck this government.
[01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:38.000]  Is that Rachel Maddow's sister?
[01:31:39.039 --> 01:31:39.720]  Or brother?
[01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:44.180]  I mean, these people are psychotics.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:52.720]  And they believe they're the establishment.
[01:31:52.939 --> 01:31:53.920]  You know, they act like they're rebels.
[01:31:54.039 --> 01:31:55.140]  They know they're with the system.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:56.939]  They like running your life.
[01:31:57.039 --> 01:32:00.560]  They like making your kids wear masks, giving poison shots, teaching your son he's really a girl.
[01:32:00.779 --> 01:32:01.739]  These are terrorists.
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:08.520]  Now, I want to get to this big Trump video here in a moment, going on the warpath against the Department of Education.
[01:32:08.699 --> 01:32:09.060]  It's beautiful.
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:21.199]  But let's play the new clips I got, two, three, and four, back-to-back, on the B4 movement out of South Korea of women hating men and shaving their heads.
[01:32:21.739 --> 01:32:23.600]  And again, this is the left.
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.300]  They choose not to have children.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:29.739]  They sterilize their own children if they do.
[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:31.939]  They hate men.
[01:32:32.779 --> 01:32:35.300]  They are self-immolating themselves.
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:38.300]  They are committing genetic suicide.
[01:32:38.539 --> 01:32:40.939]  And I'll tell these women, please wear a mask.
[01:32:41.659 --> 01:32:43.100]  You're just not going to make our children wear them.
[01:32:43.199 --> 01:32:47.720]  Please cover up your demonic faces.
[01:32:48.979 --> 01:32:52.060]  Well, that woman sits there and licks food out of her teeth.
[01:32:52.199 --> 01:32:54.500]  I mean, they're just all so creepy.
[01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:56.420]  What happened?
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:57.479]  Where did they come from?
[01:33:02.010 --> 01:33:04.409]  That's one reason really big bad wars are terrible.
[01:33:05.029 --> 01:33:07.210]  They've got scientific studies on it.
[01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:17.930]  The best men go off and die and then weak men have kids and then they have kids and you get these people.
[01:33:18.270 --> 01:33:21.810]  They have no common sense, no instincts, no nothing.
[01:33:21.930 --> 01:33:24.590]  Just the dumbest, weakest people just breed.
[01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:26.310]  And the globalists love that.
[01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:27.510]  They say they're doing eugenics.
[01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:30.909]  Yeah, they want the smart people dead and a bunch of morons they can control.
[01:33:33.029 --> 01:33:34.430]  And now they don't even need the idiots anymore.
[01:33:35.890 --> 01:33:37.930]  So here's more on the 4B movement.
[01:33:39.409 --> 01:33:47.229]  As one of the leaders of this movement, I have been messaged so many times to come up with a solution, a more permanent solution than blue bracelets.
[01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:48.210]  This lady's a joke.
[01:33:48.810 --> 01:33:49.989]  She's joking, the others aren't.
[01:33:50.029 --> 01:33:53.270]  When we're in the pickup line at school, we know how to identify each other.
[01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:56.829]  And some people suggested a tattoo, so I did go get my tattoo.
[01:33:57.689 --> 01:34:05.789]  I suggest everybody get this so that when you're in the pickup line at school and you need to know what parents you can talk to, you just have to go like this.
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:15.220]  It's skinny hair.
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:16.960]  Now this is real.
[01:34:17.319 --> 01:34:17.939]  Here we go.
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:19.100]  I've given up on America.
[01:34:19.319 --> 01:34:22.439]  I've also given up on coloring this hair because, right?
[01:34:22.939 --> 01:34:24.260]  Fuck coloring my hair.
[01:34:24.819 --> 01:34:27.119]  Fuck having my hair be long and luxurious.
[01:34:28.119 --> 01:34:29.239]  Fuck all that shit.
[01:34:29.439 --> 01:34:30.359]  Fuck being skinny.
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:31.880]  Fuck being hot.
[01:34:32.279 --> 01:34:35.000]  Fuck being all the things that the patriarchy wants us to be.
[01:34:35.159 --> 01:34:37.579]  Because clearly, they don't give a shit about us.
[01:34:37.909 --> 01:34:41.989]  And I'm talking to you too, those of you ladies who have the internalized misogyny.
[01:34:42.270 --> 01:34:43.029]  I thought this was bleeped.
[01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.750]  We can't play this.
[01:34:43.829 --> 01:34:46.149]  The only word she knows is F you, you know what.
[01:34:46.729 --> 01:34:55.529]  But I mean, you talk about F the white people, F the government, F America, F everything.
[01:34:57.369 --> 01:35:06.810]  I mean, imagine, because she didn't get Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in, who are human trafficking children and sex slaves.
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:12.199]  And then she's just throwing a giant temper tantrum, cutting her hair off.
[01:35:13.079 --> 01:35:14.979]  Let me make a little guess here.
[01:35:15.159 --> 01:35:17.479]  This woman doesn't ever have a boyfriend.
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:20.100]  And nobody wants to be with her.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  So she's just self-harming here on TV. They've had a bunch of cases of leptists committing suicide, killing their whole families.
[01:35:30.359 --> 01:35:34.020]  And they say before they commit suicide, if they kill their wife and children...
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.300]  And their neighbors and other people.
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:38.340]  Well, the world's so bad, I'm helping them.
[01:35:38.579 --> 01:35:40.439]  That reminds me of Joseph Goebbels.
[01:35:41.819 --> 01:35:49.100]  Poisoning his, what, six, seven children in Hitler's bunker in Berlin at the end of World War II? And then he and his wife committed suicide with cyanide?
[01:35:52.399 --> 01:35:53.279]  You're in a cult.
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:56.420]  You're in an absolute cult.
[01:35:56.539 --> 01:35:58.159]  Let's go to clip four now.
[01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:01.060]  The 4B movement is a dangerous cult.
[01:36:02.199 --> 01:36:09.880]  No, this is not just a protest, but one to end the lives of millions of US men, with millions participating and nowhere left for men to run.
[01:36:10.079 --> 01:36:25.199]  People were terrified after the results of the US election had led many women to participate in a movement called 4B, which has women encouraging other women to avoid men completely by breaking up with their current boyfriends or husbands, avoid having children with men, rejecting traditional female jobs,
[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:28.020]  and for some, to even quit jobs owned by men.
[01:36:28.170 --> 01:36:35.670]  With even viral videos with hundreds of thousands of likes and thousands of saves encouraging women to poison their lover's food with aqua tofana.
[01:36:35.829 --> 01:36:40.090]  If you can't divorce their husband, look up aqua tofana.
[01:36:40.810 --> 01:36:43.729]  And if your wife or girlfriend is doing this, get out now.
[01:36:44.010 --> 01:36:55.470]  The movement started in South Korea with women going six years without any interaction with men, as well as Korea having a significant 21% decline in the population in just one year.
[01:36:55.649 --> 01:36:58.130]  And soon the US will have no one left.
[01:36:59.829 --> 01:37:02.569]  Total collapse of society, that's the Great Reset.
[01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:13.449]  Turn men and women against each other, cut off the resources, tell women it's men's fault, and then men Statistically, you're still working harder than ever and trying to make things work.
[01:37:13.529 --> 01:37:18.689]  But a lot of men also are getting lazy and tuning out and leaving women alone and just watching porn all day.
[01:37:19.369 --> 01:37:21.050]  And this is how you destroy civilization.
[01:37:21.050 --> 01:37:23.369]  And so we're not out of the woods yet, obviously.
[01:37:24.649 --> 01:37:24.930]  All right.
[01:37:25.909 --> 01:37:37.430]  President Trump has pledged to fire and also prosecute people that illegally inside the federal government worked with big tech and others to censor Americans and election metal.
[01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:38.949]  That's not vengeance.
[01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.630]  That's justice.
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:46.699]  He has pledged to deport the drug dealers and the criminals and the human traffickers day one.
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.060]  That's being set up right now.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:54.819]  He has pledged to cut off the U.S. funding for the Ukraine war and push Russia for a major peace deal.
[01:37:55.359 --> 01:37:57.199]  And Russia's signal they're ready for that.
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:06.479]  He has pledged to take the controls off U.S. energy exploration that will massively lower prices and drive down inflation.
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:08.180]  And the list goes on and on.
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.739]  And he's pledged to dismantle the deep state.
[01:38:11.899 --> 01:38:29.579]  And a big part of that is all these unconstitutional federal agencies that have only existed in the last 60-70 years that have wrecked this country and that sign on to UNESCO and the United Nations treaties where the UN is in control of our immigration policy.
[01:38:29.699 --> 01:38:30.100]  Look it up.
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:33.800]  The UN is in control of our education policy.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.079]  It's all under UNESCO, the United Nations Educational Cultural Organization.
[01:38:39.159 --> 01:38:42.659]  And so the Department of Education must be abolished.
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:45.420]  And then you send it back to the states.
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:46.380]  Same thing with Roe v.
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:46.600]  Wade.
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:51.399]  The federal government does not have a jurisdiction over that.
[01:38:51.699 --> 01:38:52.359]  Read the Constitution.
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:53.439]  It's the states.
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:56.380]  For women that love their abortions so much, it's a sacrament.
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:58.899]  There were more abortions the last four years since Roe v.
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:00.140]  Wade was overturned than there was before.
[01:39:00.739 --> 01:39:02.199]  It's all just made up.
[01:39:02.779 --> 01:39:05.800]  But some states, people decide to vote and say, we're not doing it here.
[01:39:07.810 --> 01:39:09.590]  So, that's what this is all about.
[01:39:09.789 --> 01:39:12.869]  And with the Department of Education, send it back to the states.
[01:39:12.989 --> 01:39:16.550]  That's why you get unified drag queen story time and critical race theory.
[01:39:16.649 --> 01:39:20.449]  And then you've got the Department of Education and other groups giving huge grants to private schools.
[01:39:20.689 --> 01:39:23.189]  Many of the private schools are worse than the public schools.
[01:39:24.250 --> 01:39:25.590]  I read the reports every day.
[01:39:25.729 --> 01:39:28.710]  I talk to people that have kids in public school and private in Austin.
[01:39:29.170 --> 01:39:36.250]  And, I mean, the nicest private schools, like Trinity, supposedly Christian, and St.
[01:39:36.569 --> 01:39:37.010]  Andrews.
[01:39:38.710 --> 01:39:44.270]  Literally secretly teach the kids that they're really in other sex and all this other crap when they're in elementary school.
[01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:46.789]  These are cults.
[01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:48.189]  These are grooming your children.
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:51.279]  It's happening all over the world.
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:40:01.319]  It's BlackRock, and the UN set the corporate rules for corporate governance with a corporate social credit score, and now they're rolling it out for the individual through the central bank digital currencies.
[01:40:01.319 --> 01:40:02.539]  We've got to stop it.
[01:40:02.899 --> 01:40:11.699]  And you do that by abolishing the federal agencies that interface with the UN and BlackRock and the WEF and the ESG corporate credit score.
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:17.619]  Here's President Trump announces he's closing down the Department of Education, sending all education back to the states.
[01:40:20.590 --> 01:40:33.529]  And one other thing I'll be doing very early in the administration is closing up the Department of Education in Washington, D.C., and sending all education and education work and needs back to the states.
[01:40:33.789 --> 01:40:39.890]  We want them to run the education of our children because they'll do a much better job of it.
[01:40:40.050 --> 01:40:41.210]  You can't do worse.
[01:40:41.449 --> 01:40:47.069]  We spend more money per pupil by three times than any other nation.
[01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:50.409]  And yet we're absolutely at the bottom.
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:52.020]  We're one of the worst.
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:53.819]  So you can't do worse.
[01:40:54.039 --> 01:41:06.960]  We're going to end education coming out of Washington, D.C. We're going to close it up, all those buildings all over the place, and yet people that in many cases hate our children, we're going to send it all back to the states.
[01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:08.020]  Thank you very much.
[01:41:09.239 --> 01:41:17.420]  And another big move, Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican New York, will be the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. She's an anti-globalist super patriot.
[01:41:19.819 --> 01:41:25.619]  It's just getting better and better and better by the moment.
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:32.880]  And Trump pulled us out of the UN migration treaty when he got elected eight years ago.
[01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:34.060]  He's doing that.
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:39.479]  And of course, we're not going to have the UN treaty over our bodies, the pandemic treaty.
[01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:42.109]  This is a big deal.
[01:41:42.369 --> 01:41:46.170]  This is not the Trump of eight years ago who did pretty good but didn't know what was going on.
[01:41:46.369 --> 01:41:49.130]  He is battle-hardened after nine years of fighting.
[01:41:49.829 --> 01:41:55.090]  He said that and we're seeing action, action, action, action, action.
[01:41:56.989 --> 01:42:12.140]  And that's why we've got to make a really big deal about this and war game this and Trump's got to get out ahead of this because do you think on the 26th In New York State,
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:24.539]  when they have this rigged conviction, which just so happens to be four years in prison on Rikers Island, they've gotten Rikers Island ready for them.
[01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:34.020]  Do you think that that judge isn't going to clap him in irons on the 26th?
[01:42:34.319 --> 01:42:37.340]  Yeah, it's ballsy, it's crazy, it's constitutional crisis.
[01:42:41.869 --> 01:42:48.390]  And see, then the right move will be for Trump to say it's a fraud, it's a lie.
[01:42:50.689 --> 01:42:52.810]  He can't pardon himself with a state conviction.
[01:42:56.130 --> 01:43:02.810]  You've got to have the Supreme Court come in with an emergency hearing and say that it's a separation of powers.
[01:43:03.970 --> 01:43:06.029]  It's something never even foreseen by the founders.
[01:43:07.890 --> 01:43:13.229]  And that The case is suspended for four years, something like that.
[01:43:16.369 --> 01:43:30.010]  Should the judge move ahead with sentencing, Trump could be ordered to serve as much as four years in prison time, but the judge is not required to sentence the president-elect to prison, and he could impose a lesser sentence such as probation, home confinement, community service, or a fine.
[01:43:31.369 --> 01:43:44.989]  So, other than them trying to kill Trump again, which you know they're going to try, guaranteed, This is the big enchilada right here to legitimize them saying we're not going to certify his win.
[01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:48.329]  We can't have somebody ordered to prison being the president.
[01:43:48.510 --> 01:43:52.329]  And that's not constitutional, but they're going to try it.
[01:43:52.409 --> 01:43:55.029]  Since when is something being legal something they follow?
[01:43:55.170 --> 01:43:59.649]  I mean, yesterday I came out and said, oh, the Democrats are openly calling for her to be made the new president.
[01:43:59.890 --> 01:44:01.069]  It's not just a gimmick.
[01:44:01.170 --> 01:44:05.550]  It's so that they can make it look more legitimate when he is sentenced.
[01:44:06.359 --> 01:44:13.779]  To have her say, I'll just stay on, don't worry, then have the left burn down the cities, and they think that's enough pressure to have the Supreme Court not step in.
[01:44:15.239 --> 01:44:17.460]  People are like, well, that's not the Constitution, that's illegal.
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:24.619]  Well, so it's not legal for her to have Biden step down and then make her the candidate, the nominee.
[01:44:25.159 --> 01:44:33.680]  So, I mean, it's not legal for Mayorkas and them to cover up kidnapped kids by the hundreds of thousands and ship them all over the place and cover up their identities.
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:40.180]  So, that's where we are.
[01:44:42.399 --> 01:44:52.100]  So, right now, unless Trump gets ahead of this, we should have a whole show on what he should do and have expert guests on and debate this and really brainstorm it.
[01:44:54.899 --> 01:44:57.479]  And then again, this is how they script it.
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:44:58.859]  I get in their heads.
[01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:02.979]  The judge orders him to report to prison.
[01:45:05.210 --> 01:45:23.170]  And then they'll say, because a right-winger Nazi Trump supporter, of course it won't be, truck bombs of black college, any place where you got a bunch of black folks together, a big black church shoots it up,
[01:45:23.789 --> 01:45:27.550]  something like that is that, oh my God, see, that's it, that's it.
[01:45:28.489 --> 01:45:29.569]  You know, he's a criminal.
[01:45:29.670 --> 01:45:30.529]  Report to prison.
[01:45:30.729 --> 01:45:32.890]  And, you know, this Trump supporter just did this.
[01:45:32.890 --> 01:45:35.069]  And we're, you know, we're just not going to put up with it.
[01:45:35.850 --> 01:45:40.930]  And if people don't buy that, well, then Russia hits the power grid and half the power goes out in the country for two weeks.
[01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:47.449]  I mean, that's, that's, that's, that's probably a war game they've already got on the table.
[01:45:47.590 --> 01:45:49.869]  In fact, I guarantee you that's the scenario they got on the table, the deep state.
[01:45:50.670 --> 01:45:54.909]  And that's where the Pentagon's all, oh, we're going to stop Trump from doing bad things.
[01:45:55.090 --> 01:45:57.409]  Oh, normalizing their coup.
[01:46:00.149 --> 01:46:02.689]  So, we have a Harris deep state coup already in place.
[01:46:03.210 --> 01:46:10.829]  They want to make it official, make her the president, try to make it look legitimate, even though it's not, for people that are constitutionally illiterate.
[01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:15.449]  And there's a lot of other crap they could pull.
[01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:20.109]  But you see the world wanting prosperity and peace.
[01:46:20.350 --> 01:46:24.409]  Stock market way up, Bitcoin way up, peace deals being offered everywhere.
[01:46:25.289 --> 01:46:27.310]  Massive new factories to be broken ground.
[01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:30.159]  Because under Trump, it's open for business.
[01:46:30.359 --> 01:46:31.939]  You know, we're not a death cult.
[01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:33.119]  We don't want you to eat bugs.
[01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:34.140]  We're optimistic.
[01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:35.479]  We want to have freedom.
[01:46:35.479 --> 01:46:36.420]  We want to have peace.
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:37.180]  We want to have justice.
[01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:38.199]  You know, we could do that.
[01:46:38.319 --> 01:46:42.579]  But the globalists say there's too many of us, and humans are a scourge, and we've got to be depopulated.
[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:46.159]  So you pay to put your kids in public or private school.
[01:46:47.739 --> 01:46:50.539]  Even if it's public, you're paying the property tax and the rest of it.
[01:46:51.979 --> 01:47:02.260]  And then you send them there to get brainwashed, you send them to college, they get more brainwashed, and their whole identity is America's evil and sucks, and Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris and Chuckie Schumer are going to save us.
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:06.979]  And these people are lost.
[01:47:07.079 --> 01:47:08.000]  All they know is the lie.
[01:47:08.119 --> 01:47:14.079]  All they know is the utopia is coming as soon as we give everybody free stuff and things go totally bankrupt.
[01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:16.979]  Well, we've got to blow up the old system before the heaven comes.
[01:47:19.649 --> 01:47:20.770]  And of course, it never comes.
[01:47:21.149 --> 01:47:22.109]  It just gets worse.
[01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:31.390]  But they, like a person that does the Nigerian email scam that's been around for 30 years, folks don't know about it.
[01:47:31.489 --> 01:47:33.569]  I mean, you've been hiding under a rock, but you get an email.
[01:47:33.729 --> 01:47:36.930]  Prince Abubu has $100,000 for you.
[01:47:37.449 --> 01:47:39.970]  He just needs you to give him $10,000.
[01:47:40.289 --> 01:47:44.970]  And then you give the $10,000 to Prince Abubu, and they give you a phone number and say, here's how you call and get your money.
[01:47:45.069 --> 01:47:45.510]  So you call.
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:53.060]  And they say, Prince of Boo Boo can't talk to you right now, but he'll give you $200,000 if you give him another $20,000.
[01:47:54.939 --> 01:48:06.039]  And then you get so excited, your ship has come in, and then some people gave millions of dollars to Prince of Boo Boo because they wouldn't admit they got into the scam at the beginning.
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:12.380]  And the whole Democratic Party and the leftist, communist, new order system is Prince of Boo Boo.
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:15.899]  And the transgenderism and all of it is, oh, well, we chopped your breast off.
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:21.640]  Now let's, you know, chop your forearm off and make a fake penis that doesn't work and stinks and falls off.
[01:48:21.739 --> 01:48:22.420]  That'll make you happy.
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:28.439]  Oh, you committed suicide after, not because we, you know, cut your body up, but because the right-wingers didn't love you enough.
[01:48:29.359 --> 01:48:30.880]  It's all Prince of Boo-Boo crap.
[01:48:32.039 --> 01:48:33.600]  I'm going to start the third hour.
[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:41.819]  Huge guest joining us, the head of Rasmussen polling on what happened in the election, what's coming, his prediction on the open races still, and what he's seeing politically in this realignment.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:42.920]  He's dead on.
[01:48:43.079 --> 01:48:44.119]  You want to stay with us.
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:45.000]  Separately.

[01:52:02.170 --> 01:52:05.850]  I know you do, because the VIP will get double entries in every single giveaway.
[01:52:06.090 --> 01:52:08.489]  No effort, just double your chances just like that.
[01:52:08.970 --> 01:52:10.729]  Exclusive VIP-only giveaways.
[01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:12.630]  This is where it gets big, folks.
[01:52:12.750 --> 01:52:16.250]  VIP members get entered into their own exclusive giveaways every month.
[01:52:16.350 --> 01:52:17.970]  Nobody else is allowed in these.
[01:52:18.199 --> 01:52:20.779]  Early access to products, promos, and giveaways.
[01:52:21.079 --> 01:52:26.039]  VIP members get first access to new products, promotions, and giveaways before anyone else.
[01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:27.279]  You're in the know.
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:29.500]  Oh, and did I mention orders over $99?
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:30.699]  Free shipping.
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:33.880]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:35.300]  It just goes on from there.
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:42.420]  So, theallocshowstore.com forward slash VIP. Or just at the top of theallocshowstore.com, you see the VIP button.
[01:52:42.819 --> 01:52:44.739]  We're fighting the new world order.
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:46.619]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[01:52:46.779 --> 01:52:51.340]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:52.760]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:54.500]  Yellowshowstore.com.
[01:52:55.039 --> 01:53:00.779]  It's up to you whether you want to back The number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[01:53:01.039 --> 01:53:10.100]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[01:53:10.319 --> 01:53:17.359]  And I just don't know why I'm just a lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:19.500]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:22.460]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:23.720]  We've already...
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:25.659]  Just devastated them.
[01:53:25.779 --> 01:53:28.800]  I mean, world government, the New World Orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[01:53:29.079 --> 01:53:30.380]  The whole world's turning against them.
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:34.659]  They're super dangerous as they're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[01:53:35.079 --> 01:53:45.340]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've understood, that I should let these Criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:47.140]  So, again, I don't give up.
[01:53:47.279 --> 01:53:50.020]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[01:53:50.239 --> 01:53:53.640]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:56.119]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[01:53:56.220 --> 01:53:57.600]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[01:53:57.739 --> 01:54:06.300]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control overs with a social credit score and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[01:54:06.359 --> 01:54:14.670]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[01:54:15.909 --> 01:54:17.149]  I mean, it's just...
[01:54:17.149 --> 01:54:18.510]  This is a joke.
[01:54:18.789 --> 01:54:19.970]  This is ridiculous.
[01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:21.529]  We're changing the world.
[01:54:21.649 --> 01:54:24.529]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[01:54:24.970 --> 01:54:31.489]  All right, we've got him connected, but over 350 radio stations do not carry the first six minutes.
[01:54:31.810 --> 01:54:38.310]  So I want to wait to go to the head of Rasmus's polling, Mark Mitchell, who absolutely nailed it.
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:41.699]  And he nailed it in 2016.
[01:54:41.699 --> 01:54:42.859]  He nailed it in 2020.
[01:54:42.859 --> 01:54:43.800]  He nailed it this time.
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:46.100]  They are hands down the best polling agency in the world.
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:59.489]  And he's going to talk about what happened, the current races, projections, and then what the new numbers are about the mindset of the country, And where things are going.
[01:54:59.609 --> 01:55:01.109]  Because they do polls nobody else does.
[01:55:01.770 --> 01:55:04.090]  They really do amazing work.
[01:55:04.189 --> 01:55:05.750]  That's why they're so vital.
[01:55:05.869 --> 01:55:10.170]  Roger Stone agrees with me that Rasmussen is the best and Mark Mitchell is the best of the best.
[01:55:10.649 --> 01:55:11.869]  And man, did he nail it.
[01:55:11.970 --> 01:55:14.149]  I mean, he said, looks like we'll probably have a Reagan-esque victory.
[01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:17.529]  1984 level victory.
[01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:22.430]  That night, Roger, who's usually a pessimist, said the same thing on the Sunday before.
[01:55:22.810 --> 01:55:23.649]  Two days before.
[01:55:23.789 --> 01:55:25.789]  He said, I think Trump will win that night or that morning.
[01:55:26.770 --> 01:55:27.670]  This is massive.
[01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:30.359]  And then we'll also get into him.
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:37.039]  The numbers coming out where they're catching glitches that gave races to Democrats are being flipped back to Republicans because they're not glitches.
[01:55:37.119 --> 01:55:39.420]  They're catching the fraud in live time.
[01:55:41.039 --> 01:55:41.939]  That's coming up.
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:44.779]  And then Mark's just a smart guy in general.
[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:49.939]  I want to get his take on what the deep state's going to play, what they're going to do, what they're planning.
[01:55:50.159 --> 01:55:53.479]  This thing about, oh, putting Harris in as the president is a gimmick.
[01:55:53.539 --> 01:55:54.859]  It's a lot worse than that, in my view.
[01:55:55.119 --> 01:55:57.659]  Because, you know, he'll tell you what the polls show, but he'll give you his opinion.
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:00.859]  Which is really good.
[01:56:01.239 --> 01:56:02.159]  And that's what we like.
[01:56:02.279 --> 01:56:03.420]  We just like the guests that are right.
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:04.720]  My show is so easy.
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:06.340]  There's a lot of people that are smart and are right.
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:08.539]  And the more right they are, the more we have moms.
[01:56:08.539 --> 01:56:09.340]  We're very blessed to have them.
[01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:10.180]  We'll be back after the break.
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:12.140]  Please stay with us and please keep us on air.
[01:56:12.710 --> 01:56:17.930]  I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's gonna save this country and nothing's gonna stop it.
[01:56:18.949 --> 01:56:22.489]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[01:56:22.670 --> 01:56:25.310]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[01:56:25.409 --> 01:56:26.210]  I'm still not in shape.
[01:56:27.090 --> 01:56:28.489]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[01:56:28.630 --> 01:56:29.569]  Don't tell me you're eating right.
[01:56:29.670 --> 01:56:30.310]  I'm not gonna bite it.
[01:56:31.229 --> 01:56:33.930]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:38.649]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[01:56:38.909 --> 01:56:40.670]  I did it all.
[01:56:41.180 --> 01:56:44.760]  From the alexjonesstore.com with ultimate sea moss, the ultimate seafood.
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:45.699]  That's why, right here.
[01:56:46.159 --> 01:56:51.520]  This is the ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:53.319]  The ozempic of the sea.
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:55.279]  The ozempic of the sea.
[01:56:57.970 --> 01:57:01.930]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss.
[01:57:02.029 --> 01:57:05.229]  And I am doing a plug here, because, you know, we could be shut down next Tuesday.
[01:57:05.770 --> 01:57:08.710]  Infowars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court.
[01:57:08.869 --> 01:57:12.029]  But we'll continue on in the year one way or another, working with great folks.
[01:57:14.649 --> 01:57:16.390]  Now is the time to wear Trump gear.
[01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:19.529]  And we've got the best designs at the alexjonesstore.com.
[01:57:19.649 --> 01:57:21.850]  You support the Second American Revolution.
[01:57:22.170 --> 01:57:23.649]  You exercise your free speech.
[01:57:23.869 --> 01:57:25.569]  You stand up to the bullies.
[01:57:27.930 --> 01:57:36.050]  You exercise your will, and it keeps this broadcast, and we're shut down next week, still on the air at the Alex Jones Network.
[01:57:36.989 --> 01:57:40.409]  It'll be on the radio, the TV, all the same stations.
[01:57:40.409 --> 01:57:41.449]  It's all set up.
[01:57:42.250 --> 01:57:50.649]  The crew, the studios, all of it, but we need more funds to ensure we're full power when we continue our assault.
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:56.060]  So you're literally, in the information war, refueling the aircraft, loading the weapons, arming them.
[01:57:56.699 --> 01:58:04.439]  And we've already got a lot of weapons loaded, but we need to be fully loaded when we take off at maximum load for maximum attack when we do our attack runs in the information war.
[01:58:05.619 --> 01:58:06.060]  So...
[01:58:06.710 --> 01:58:09.189]  We're on the tarmac right now, making sure everything's straight here.
[01:58:09.850 --> 01:58:12.090]  You need to go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:58:12.649 --> 01:58:15.670]  A beautiful black shirt with an American eagle and gold.
[01:58:15.789 --> 01:58:16.550]  Says Trump won.
[01:58:16.970 --> 01:58:18.270]  Beautiful red hoodie.
[01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:19.670]  People are going crazy over that.
[01:58:20.069 --> 01:58:21.510]  We're on white with Trump won.
[01:58:22.510 --> 01:58:24.470]  Today is your Independence Day, 125.
[01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:26.220]  25.
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:28.359]  Yeah, that's when we really have the Independence Day.
[01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:30.319]  When we keep them alive and it gets in there.
[01:58:30.819 --> 01:58:31.420]  That's great.
[01:58:31.979 --> 01:58:33.340]  So many new hats.
[01:58:33.539 --> 01:58:34.800]  All of it made right there in Arkansas.
[01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:36.020]  So you get this stuff quick.
[01:58:36.119 --> 01:58:36.979]  It's already being made right now.
[01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:38.920]  A lot of new Trump shirts and stuff.
[01:58:38.939 --> 01:58:39.800]  It'll take them weeks to get done.
[01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:40.600]  Not our sponsor.
[01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:41.560]  They're ready right now.
[01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:44.279]  So your order's in at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:58:45.230 --> 01:58:47.609]  So many amazing designs, thealexjonesstore.com.

[01:59:07.850 --> 01:59:18.689]  So if you're going to be a supporter, everyone should be a VIP. Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a really informative, amazing guest here with us.
[01:59:18.829 --> 01:59:26.210]  I've been following Rasmussen Polls for many, many years, and it's hands down the most accurate polling agency in the world.
[01:59:26.270 --> 01:59:33.090]  And we have their Director of Polling Operations, Mark Mitchell, with us, RasmussenReports.com, Mark underscore R underscore Mitchell.
[01:59:33.899 --> 01:59:35.579]  I want to cover what happened in the election.
[01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:36.579]  He nailed it.
[01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:37.579]  His team nailed it.
[01:59:37.699 --> 01:59:40.880]  I want to cover the current races that are still up in the air.
[01:59:41.220 --> 01:59:42.680]  Will we secure the trifecta?
[01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:44.159]  Will they try some cicanery?
[01:59:44.340 --> 01:59:45.239]  Which we know they are.
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:52.239]  They've also had a lot of areas in the country, like Michigan, where they found that glitches have given wins to Democrats, and now that's being reversed.
[01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:53.779]  I mean, this is amazing.
[01:59:55.020 --> 01:59:59.739]  They do a lot of polls on culture and the people and the mindsets.
[01:59:59.859 --> 02:00:02.199]  We can also get a view into the Trump transition.
[02:00:02.859 --> 02:00:05.180]  Also, separate from his polls, this is a smart guy.
[02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:09.140]  I don't think they're still planning to go.
[02:00:09.319 --> 02:00:13.340]  I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if this judge in New York doesn't order Trump to report to prison.
[02:00:13.340 --> 02:00:15.100]  He can't pardon himself in a state case.
[02:00:15.359 --> 02:00:16.520]  That's the 26th.
[02:00:16.859 --> 02:00:26.119]  We're good to go.
[02:00:38.899 --> 02:00:40.159]  Yeah, great things are happening.
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:41.000]  People are awake.
[02:00:41.159 --> 02:00:43.760]  If they try to pull something, it'll blow up their face bigger.
[02:00:43.899 --> 02:00:45.819]  But this is a very dangerous time.
[02:00:45.819 --> 02:00:48.220]  That's a large compendium of issues I've laid out.
[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:51.899]  I'm going to do my best to give him the floor here to run through that.
[02:00:52.979 --> 02:00:55.600]  Again, we appreciate Mark Mitchell joining us.
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:57.159]  Mark, wow, you nailed it, my friend.
[02:00:58.750 --> 02:01:04.350]  Yeah, I almost want to be deputized as an info warrior because I was fighting my own info war.
[02:01:04.470 --> 02:01:07.489]  Let me tell you, the polling was better than it was in previous cycles.
[02:01:07.489 --> 02:01:17.649]  But what it looks like is that the polling error in mainstream media is just as much as it needs to be so that they can paint the false narrative that the Democrat Is winning.
[02:01:17.829 --> 02:01:19.109]  The lies were so bad.
[02:01:19.409 --> 02:01:23.449]  The Ann Seltzer thing is gonna put a black mark on polling for years and years and years.
[02:01:23.630 --> 02:01:29.529]  And it was just utterly sad how many people MSNBC was saying, like, this is hope.
[02:01:29.729 --> 02:01:36.069]  There's signs from this one ridiculous poll that somehow Kamala Harris' support is being underemphasized.
[02:01:36.649 --> 02:01:41.710]  Listen, what I'm putting out is data and not election predictions, and I've said that very clearly on your show.
[02:01:41.850 --> 02:01:42.890]  People should doubt me.
[02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:47.470]  I think we've shown over time that we're accurate, but at any point in time, we can miss on something.
[02:01:47.630 --> 02:01:57.649]  But what I've seen on social media and the internet this time is that people were absolutely looking at the data, going through the mainstream media crosstabs.
[02:01:57.989 --> 02:02:00.949]  Their lies are not working anymore, and we proved it.
[02:02:01.050 --> 02:02:02.770]  And let me tell you, We did nail this.
[02:02:02.970 --> 02:02:05.789]  The popular vote number's still moving around a little bit.
[02:02:05.909 --> 02:02:07.949]  But last time I checked, it was 2.4.
[02:02:08.210 --> 02:02:16.250]  But if people go to RasmussenReports.com and look at our final call crosstabs and expand out the decimal place, it's exactly 2.4.
[02:02:17.010 --> 02:02:20.689]  Exactly, exactly nailed the national popular vote.
[02:02:20.949 --> 02:02:23.109]  Now, it all comes down to the states, though.
[02:02:23.310 --> 02:02:27.510]  And so here was something I was expecting, is that Trump was going to outperform the state polling.
[02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:32.149]  Turns out that we basically nailed it He outperformed a little bit.
[02:02:32.289 --> 02:02:35.369]  And I said going into this, probably going to be a 297 map.
[02:02:35.550 --> 02:02:36.630]  Michigan's too close to call.
[02:02:36.930 --> 02:02:39.729]  If he outperforms at all, it'll be 312.
[02:02:40.029 --> 02:02:40.829]  And he did.
[02:02:41.050 --> 02:02:50.789]  But the thing that really gets my goat is that the entire country, New Jersey, every state moved 8.78 points to the right.
[02:02:51.250 --> 02:02:55.329]  And what yet we're seeing here is frantically looking at House races.
[02:02:55.329 --> 02:02:56.649]  Is there too close to call?
[02:02:56.770 --> 02:02:58.409]  And is the House going to go Republican?
[02:02:58.569 --> 02:02:59.310]  I think it is.
[02:02:59.510 --> 02:03:05.949]  But if you just do some basic math, 7% of 435 is 30 seats.
[02:03:06.409 --> 02:03:10.630]  So why didn't the Republicans pick up something in the vicinity of 30 seats?
[02:03:10.729 --> 02:03:12.210]  I think that's a really valid question.
[02:03:12.449 --> 02:03:21.210]  Because in 2016 and in 2020, the state polling was to the right, the state outcome was to the right of the national popular vote.
[02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:26.529]  But here for the first time, the state outcomes were to the left of the national popular vote.
[02:03:26.649 --> 02:03:28.029]  And that is weird and different.
[02:03:28.489 --> 02:03:43.710]  And so I think that the question that Republican voters should be asking themselves for the next four years is how come Trump changed like 10 million people's minds, inspired new people to come out and vote for him that never have, inspired switch voters all across the country in almost every state.
[02:03:43.909 --> 02:03:49.250]  How come just in the battlegrounds, those particular states only moved to the right one or two points?
[02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:50.689]  I think that's a very valid question.
[02:03:51.170 --> 02:03:58.649]  And then I've shown the graph, Joe Rogan's shown it, where Kamala got way less votes than Biden got four years ago.
[02:03:58.890 --> 02:04:03.369]  And everybody's asking, what caused that discrepancy?
[02:04:03.890 --> 02:04:05.189]  Do you have an idea?
[02:04:05.350 --> 02:04:05.869]  There it is.
[02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:14.800]  I think it's not going to be as big as this graph shows because I still think votes are coming in, but it's an absolutely valid question.
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:20.319]  In the polling, there was such a shift to the right, and yet Republicans are outperforming only slightly.
[02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:25.699]  I think in 2020, Republicans probably benefited some too from all the superfluous mail-in ballots floating around.
[02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:29.329]  But nowhere near as much as Democrats in 2020.
[02:04:29.550 --> 02:04:32.569]  It really does stink in a way that voters have caught on to.
[02:04:32.770 --> 02:04:37.710]  Even going into this election, 66% of voters were at least somewhat concerned the outcome would be affected by cheating.
[02:04:37.949 --> 02:04:43.590]  I think what we're going to see now is even higher numbers because all the Democrats now are talking about all the cheating in elections too.
[02:04:43.890 --> 02:04:45.350]  Turns out gaslighting doesn't work.
[02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:48.050]  Turns out you can't take these things and sweep them under the rugs.
[02:04:48.619 --> 02:04:55.000]  People saw, you know, there's videos, there's a million different things that people saw that have cast doubt on the elections.
[02:04:55.300 --> 02:04:59.039]  My advice for the good of the country is for Donald Trump coming in.
[02:04:59.140 --> 02:05:02.319]  He's got a very strong agenda that he ran on that people want to see.
[02:05:02.439 --> 02:05:03.479]  That's why they voted for him.
[02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:06.739]  But listen, it's a problem for both sides.
[02:05:07.180 --> 02:05:09.680]  He needs to go on an election integrity jihad.
[02:05:09.859 --> 02:05:12.319]  And I don't know if that means appointing a czar.
[02:05:12.479 --> 02:05:19.359]  I don't know if that means somehow sanctioning states that have shown that they're unwilling to investigate these things.
[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:25.430]  But the fact is that there is a ton of evidence courts could be looking at And they haven't at all.
[02:05:25.529 --> 02:05:28.329]  And we're the only pollsters that follow this because how can we be right?
[02:05:28.909 --> 02:05:34.109]  I'm surprised we were as right as we were in 2020 with all the magical unicorn Democrats that turned out.
[02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:35.810]  And nobody's talking about 2018.
[02:05:35.810 --> 02:05:46.029]  If you want to talk about surprise turnouts, because that was like a 60% increase in midterm cycle turnouts, and that did not have COVID. So how did that happen?
[02:05:46.170 --> 02:05:47.369]  And it's really wild.
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:55.279]  This time the Republicans had a lot more lawyers and poll watchers, and as you know, we can go over some of that, caught a lot of just open fraud.
[02:05:55.439 --> 02:06:00.899]  They called glitches, and you had all these federal judges saying illegals can vote, the Supreme Court saying no, they can't in Virginia.
[02:06:01.359 --> 02:06:07.119]  So I see a lot of the naivete in the public denying there was fraud being proven now, and as you said, Trump said...
[02:06:08.590 --> 02:06:12.890]  We're good to go.
[02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:33.380]  100%.
[02:06:33.380 --> 02:06:41.380]  And I'll tell you, you were watching Tuesday, and the numbers across the board, I was blown away by how far everything was moving to the right.
[02:06:41.659 --> 02:06:44.880]  And yet, looking at the battlegrounds, same kind of thing as 2020.
[02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:46.319]  Oh, why isn't he doing better there?
[02:06:46.460 --> 02:06:47.899]  Oh, why isn't anybody calling anything?
[02:06:48.079 --> 02:06:49.260]  Why didn't they call Georgia yet?
[02:06:49.399 --> 02:06:51.840]  Oh, why isn't Fulton County dropping their numbers yet?
[02:06:51.979 --> 02:06:54.619]  And there was a really tense period there.
[02:06:56.100 --> 02:07:00.340]  8%, 7%, call it 7%, Trump moved the country to the right, 7%.
[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:05.060]  That's like in the teens of millions of people across every single state.
[02:07:05.569 --> 02:07:08.949]  And yet we're looking there and the Rust Belt had not reported.
[02:07:09.109 --> 02:07:12.550]  There were three states, very few results in.
[02:07:12.750 --> 02:07:19.829]  And yet Governor Shapiro got up and talked about how hard vote counting is and how everybody should temper their expectations.
[02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:22.529]  And Kamala Harris sent people home from her party.
[02:07:22.689 --> 02:07:29.229]  And it looked to me like for about a half hour, 45 minute period, there were no results coming in at all in the Rust Belt states.
[02:07:29.350 --> 02:07:31.250]  And I was looking at those Democrat cities.
[02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:33.270]  I was looking at numbers from Philadelphia.
[02:07:33.310 --> 02:07:35.430]  They'd only returned like a quarter of the vote.
[02:07:35.659 --> 02:07:37.300]  Pittsburgh, very few.
[02:07:38.100 --> 02:07:40.279]  Detroit, I think it was in the 30s or 40s.
[02:07:40.380 --> 02:07:50.300]  So there are all these outstanding blue city results coming in, and yet Trump was up four, five, six points in these states, not in Pennsylvania, but the other two.
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:53.699]  And then I saw Madison and Milwaukee.
[02:07:53.939 --> 02:07:57.220]  And Milwaukee, I think, was only 30 or 40% return.
[02:07:57.619 --> 02:08:00.119]  Madison, somebody had dumped the Madison results.
[02:08:00.119 --> 02:08:01.720]  It was like 90% in.
[02:08:02.220 --> 02:08:03.140]  And this is me.
[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:15.979]  Listen, maybe I'm scarred by the PTSD of 2020 and not even talking about what candidate won or not, just the absolute surprise that despite the polling, everything was wild and the calls happened and the pipes burst, right?
[02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:21.560]  I thought that potentially the county was going to stop, and yet it didn't.
[02:08:21.659 --> 02:08:23.119]  And I wonder why.
[02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:28.300]  I think she had to sweep all three of them, and they did not have enough Democrat votes in Wisconsin.
[02:08:28.479 --> 02:08:29.500]  That's conjecture.
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.960]  I don't want people to rake me over the calls.
[02:08:32.119 --> 02:08:38.859]  But this is the same kind of assessment that American voters are making when they see all this stuff in the news media.
[02:08:38.859 --> 02:08:41.380]  It did come, in my opinion, really close right there.
[02:08:41.439 --> 02:08:43.859]  And I've heard that it got kind of frantic down in Mar-a-Lago.
[02:08:44.060 --> 02:08:47.420]  So whatever happened, we'll probably never know.
[02:08:47.739 --> 02:08:52.439]  Might be because of the increase in focus that Republicans put on election integrity.
[02:08:53.130 --> 02:08:58.649]  But Trump, again, should have done, in my opinion, with the massive shift to the right in the national popular vote.
[02:08:59.029 --> 02:09:00.430]  Should have done better down-ballot.
[02:09:00.609 --> 02:09:04.770]  Should have been a lot less of a touch-and-go thing for that hour in the middle of election night.
[02:09:04.890 --> 02:09:09.109]  And I do think it's a good thing for the country that Donald Trump did have a resounding win.
[02:09:09.210 --> 02:09:12.470]  I'm sorry I keep going on, but there's one really good point people should look at.
[02:09:12.869 --> 02:09:14.909]  And that's to go to Google search trends.
[02:09:14.909 --> 02:09:18.670]  And I haven't been able to do too much polling after the election, but go to Google search trends.
[02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:21.949]  And type in the term Republican policy.
[02:09:22.130 --> 02:09:26.489]  And what you're gonna see is that over the years, basically, there's about a constant level of interest, right?
[02:09:26.789 --> 02:09:28.789]  And then put in Trump agenda.
[02:09:28.810 --> 02:09:39.260]  And what you'll see is just in the last week, Searches are through the roof for the words Trump agenda compared to Republican policy more than in any previous cycle, more than in 2016.
[02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:44.159]  And that means everybody knows Trump is driving the agenda and he's now putting good people in and that's a super good sign.
[02:09:44.220 --> 02:09:55.359]  But let's unpack what you said, Mark Mitchell, the head of polling there at Rasmussen, the number one most accurate polling agency hands down in the world before this election, but totally nailing it to the exact numbers, just over the top accuracy.
[02:09:55.659 --> 02:09:59.439]  We have the footage in Pennsylvania and Michigan and Georgia at again...
[02:10:00.670 --> 02:10:08.670]  Midnight, all these trucks pulling up, all these cars pulling up with California plates, Rhode Island plates, trying to carry in these magic ballot boxes.
[02:10:08.670 --> 02:10:10.750]  But there were so many Trump lawyers and people inside.
[02:10:11.329 --> 02:10:14.449]  At a certain point, they just said, let's not even try it.
[02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:16.350]  They tried the exact same thing.
[02:10:16.350 --> 02:10:18.949]  We were on the air at 10 o'clock at night, 11 o'clock Eastern.
[02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:22.550]  We saw it stop when Trump was ahead in the key battlegrounds.
[02:10:22.609 --> 02:10:25.470]  Owen and I both said, looks like they're about to try it again.
[02:10:25.869 --> 02:10:27.569]  Trump better get out there and talk about this.
[02:10:27.689 --> 02:10:29.189]  But at some point, they blinked.
[02:10:29.590 --> 02:10:33.569]  As you said, all those states were unified, doing the same thing at the same time.
[02:10:33.710 --> 02:10:34.850]  The counting magically stops.
[02:10:35.289 --> 02:10:40.930]  Just like in 2020, I thought they might start putting up the paper over the windows.
[02:10:41.210 --> 02:10:43.289]  But this time, the Trump people had sued.
[02:10:43.489 --> 02:10:44.550]  They weren't able to keep him out.
[02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:50.109]  And so, I think in the face of the police and the poll watchers and the lawyers, they went, we just can't do this anymore.
[02:10:50.109 --> 02:10:51.109]  This is too obvious.
[02:10:51.289 --> 02:10:54.010]  And boom, then we saw Trump win.
[02:10:54.109 --> 02:10:55.949]  I mean, I think that's not even conjecture.
[02:10:56.050 --> 02:10:56.829]  That's what happened.
[02:10:58.289 --> 02:11:06.369]  100%, and if history's any guide, the MAGA movement conservatives, they can't count on this just lucking out again next time.
[02:11:06.430 --> 02:11:08.949]  There needs to be, like I said, an absolute jihad.
[02:11:09.189 --> 02:11:12.170]  We are still within the statute of limitations for 2020.
[02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:16.350]  They can be frozen, in my understanding, about filing suits.
[02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:21.149]  And just off the top of my head, because we tracked this, and I don't know all the specific details.
[02:11:21.149 --> 02:11:22.270]  I'm the pollster, right?
[02:11:23.110 --> 02:11:33.829]  Is that there are at least three things, very specific things that a little bit of transparency and some hard questions, maybe a court hearing or two would help us get to the bottom of.
[02:11:33.989 --> 02:11:37.289]  For instance, who paid for those freaking mail trucks?
[02:11:37.619 --> 02:11:44.500]  For instance, I'm pretty sure there's a stash of ballots in Atlanta under lock and key right now that a human needs to look at.
[02:11:44.619 --> 02:11:52.579]  And I think we need to get to the answers about, for instance, at least, why there are a whole bunch of ballots in Arizona that are printed on the wrong kind of paper.
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:56.819]  Those have never been heard by a court, and there's a million other examples just like that.
[02:11:56.939 --> 02:12:00.000]  And again, this isn't stuff that's conjecture.
[02:12:00.159 --> 02:12:04.199]  It's stuff that's been part of, like, they did a massive audit in Arizona.
[02:12:04.199 --> 02:12:07.199]  This stuff was recorded and filed with sworn depositions.
[02:12:07.689 --> 02:12:08.850]  This stuff exists.
[02:12:09.050 --> 02:12:13.109]  This stuff with the postal service trucks, it's being heard in court cases.
[02:12:13.529 --> 02:12:16.270]  Trump can come in and tell us who paid for those trucks.
[02:12:16.590 --> 02:12:22.829]  I think just that question alone should be up there with the JFK files and the alien stuff.
[02:12:23.010 --> 02:12:23.529]  Absolutely.
[02:12:24.869 --> 02:12:32.569]  Now let's talk about this, because we're live right now, but as soon as you're off in a few minutes, I'm going to post this to X, and what you've said is what I saw, what we all saw.
[02:12:32.850 --> 02:12:44.159]  As a pollster, very respected, I'm not asking you to say this as the head of Rasmussen Polling, but I just basically said it, and then you said, yeah, that's dead reckoning what you see.
[02:12:44.539 --> 02:12:46.359]  And then you mentioned all the fraud we know about.
[02:12:46.539 --> 02:12:57.939]  We have millions, a million two folks that they fought for four years in Arizona to not release, because we know there are a bunch of illegals and dead people and folks in the district, and now that's coming out.
[02:12:58.450 --> 02:13:00.890]  Obviously, we need to keep those criminal investigations going.
[02:13:01.109 --> 02:13:03.590]  It took us years and years to fight through to get that.
[02:13:03.890 --> 02:13:06.189]  That's proof for the new Election Integrity Commission.
[02:13:06.569 --> 02:13:09.189]  And then we see the same plays being run this time.
[02:13:09.329 --> 02:13:12.449]  But as I said a thousand times, yeah, there's baked-in fraud.
[02:13:12.449 --> 02:13:16.590]  But if there's a landslide too big, it will override the fraud.
[02:13:16.750 --> 02:13:25.109]  Because we know there's only so many dead people and illegals and folks that aren't on voter rolls like Michigan 500,000 that Michigan had denied was there for four years.
[02:13:25.229 --> 02:13:26.329]  But on the eve of the election, say yes.
[02:13:26.359 --> 02:13:27.359]  Yeah, there's 500,000.
[02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:29.520]  We're going to leave them on there, and I guess they can vote.
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:36.020]  And the Chinese foreign student, he fraudulently votes, but his votes count.
[02:13:36.159 --> 02:13:44.380]  And all of this stuff going on, all these judges saying illegals can vote, and the Secretary of State in Texas five weeks ago saying, yeah, people can vote with non-citizen IDs.
[02:13:44.500 --> 02:13:45.859]  We now know there's fraud.
[02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:46.960]  We now know there's scams.
[02:13:47.060 --> 02:13:48.060]  We now know what's baked in.
[02:13:48.180 --> 02:13:52.659]  The specifics and all the fine details, we don't know because there hasn't been the proper investigation.
[02:13:53.529 --> 02:14:04.710]  But the headline, I think, of the takeaway here is Trump won the historic 2024 election despite massive Democrat Party fraud, vote flipping, everything else.
[02:14:04.829 --> 02:14:09.310]  And so that's the big story, is that we just go back to sleep now and think everything's fine.
[02:14:09.489 --> 02:14:11.890]  In two years, they're going to do what they've done.
[02:14:12.029 --> 02:14:18.869]  In the last few elections again, and it's only because we weren't naive, we were engaged, we got out and vote, that we overrode this fraud.
[02:14:18.869 --> 02:14:19.789]  Is that an accurate statement?
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:23.260]  Yeah, I find nothing wrong with it.
[02:14:23.359 --> 02:14:25.140]  And listen, it's going to be a crazy four years.
[02:14:25.279 --> 02:14:28.220]  People can't just write this off and say, all right, Trump won.
[02:14:28.359 --> 02:14:28.960]  He has this.
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:33.199]  Already, the forces of the establishment appear to be arrayed against him.
[02:14:33.340 --> 02:14:44.819]  And because Republicans, time and time again, conservatives, they want an outcome and they don't get it from DC. And at this point, it's almost embarrassing that they're still trying to do the same old plays.
[02:14:45.850 --> 02:14:55.649]  The Republican Party is the party of Donald Trump and the Make America Great Again movement, like they've told us over and over again, and the establishment just seems not to get it.
[02:14:55.789 --> 02:15:03.149]  I think they were the biggest losers last Tuesday, because imagine if Trump had lost, how easy it would be in D.C. to just go back to business as usual.
[02:15:03.250 --> 02:15:08.510]  But there's a new sheriff in town, and the swamp is deep, and they're going to try everything to stop him.
[02:15:08.850 --> 02:15:14.350]  I mean, the disarray in the media is kind of stunning right now, because I don't think there's anybody driving there now.
[02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:16.399]  This isn't conjecture.
[02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:25.430]  James O'Keefe has a recording from inside MSNBC where they talk about being the mouthpiece of the Kamala Harris campaign.
[02:15:25.590 --> 02:15:27.609]  Well, there is no Kamala Harris campaign right now.
[02:15:27.930 --> 02:15:29.369]  Biden's got his feet on his desk.
[02:15:29.390 --> 02:15:33.270]  He's a short timer counting down the hours until he gets to use his pardon power.
[02:15:33.489 --> 02:15:37.590]  And so right now, I think they're probably in a little bit of disarray.
[02:15:37.670 --> 02:15:40.750]  But now you have people just grasping at everything.
[02:15:40.890 --> 02:15:42.869]  Oh, there's election fraud that helped Trump win.
[02:15:43.010 --> 02:15:46.409]  Oh, we're going to be able to get him out of office somehow because he's an insurrectionist.
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:55.560]  They're really cornered right now because it looks like there's going to be accountability in D.C. And again, this is in a post-COVID bioweapon situation.
[02:15:55.899 --> 02:16:08.439]  So Republicans, I mean, they got what they wanted, but this is only the first of many steps on the way to healing, in my opinion, the republic so that the people that go to D.C. actually do what the voters want.
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:09.659]  And that's all I'm in this for.
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:11.079]  Voters should get more of what they want.
[02:16:11.859 --> 02:16:15.479]  In the time we have left, you dropped huge news here.
[02:16:16.909 --> 02:16:31.369]  Looking at the races that are still open in the House, do you think from the numbers you're seeing that the trifecta is secure, that we'll keep the House and have the legislative, the executive, and the judicial?
[02:16:32.129 --> 02:16:34.149]  What are you seeing there, Mark?
[02:16:34.370 --> 02:16:44.040]  And then I want you to comment on The Pentagon meeting in secret, looking at how to, quote, deal with bad things Trump might do.
[02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:48.159]  I mean, that's them openly hyping up a coup like they have to.
[02:16:48.379 --> 02:16:52.659]  And then the plan to have Biden step down and put in Harris.
[02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:54.159]  I mean, what a repudiation of voters.
[02:16:54.459 --> 02:16:55.840]  She's installed as the nominee.
[02:16:56.059 --> 02:16:56.760]  Biden steps down.
[02:16:56.879 --> 02:16:57.360]  That's a coup.
[02:16:57.620 --> 02:17:00.219]  And then now they want him to step down again to make her the president.
[02:17:00.219 --> 02:17:03.180]  And then what might else they be planning by having her in there?
[02:17:05.170 --> 02:17:06.649]  I really don't know what their game is.
[02:17:06.770 --> 02:17:21.889]  Let me tell you, down ballot, though, the polling showed, in my opinion, the entire Rust Belt was close, so McCormick's a pickup, but the other two I think probably should have been as well, and there's really no way for me to keep up with all the house races, but my point is that with such a massive shift to the right,
[02:17:22.010 --> 02:17:24.610]  there should have been many, many more, and it's not all fraud.
[02:17:24.770 --> 02:17:28.579]  I will say, like, my main point Listen, they gotta deal with the fraud.
[02:17:28.719 --> 02:17:31.459]  But my main point is that it is not the fraud.
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:40.020]  Because I've heard stories time and time again about what happens when a conservative MAGA House candidate decides to buck the system.
[02:17:40.159 --> 02:17:42.180]  And they array everything against him.
[02:17:42.340 --> 02:17:45.239]  And, you know, look, they've showed that things don't change.
[02:17:45.399 --> 02:17:48.979]  All the money that they dumped into Maryland when they could have been helping Carrie Lake.
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:50.360]  So I think that the Republicans...
[02:17:50.940 --> 02:17:53.920]  According to my polling, could have picked up at least three more seats.
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:57.200]  And then I don't think it should have been as close as it was in the battleground.
[02:17:57.860 --> 02:18:01.379]  Besides fraud, you got the issue of all the election rules going one way.
[02:18:01.500 --> 02:18:09.139]  You got the issue of decades of gerrymandering hostile to Republicans and the massive asymmetry in financial spend.
[02:18:09.319 --> 02:18:25.270]  And so that one thing alone could- Are really hard questions that need to be answered about the Democrat miraculous ability to turn out huge amounts of small-dollar donations, even though right now the Trump Republican Party is the party of the people, as all of our polling suggests.
[02:18:25.510 --> 02:18:31.770]  So all this needs to be cleaned up, and they're all going to do whatever they can to stop it.
[02:18:31.829 --> 02:18:38.329]  And I think the problem that we're going to see now is that they've lost their ability to gaslight.
[02:18:38.959 --> 02:18:43.479]  Everybody seems totally relaxed right now because I don't think there are any psyops going on.
[02:18:43.559 --> 02:18:44.079]  You tell me.
[02:18:44.159 --> 02:18:49.000]  You know more about this than I do, and we haven't been able to do much polling post-election.
[02:18:49.100 --> 02:18:56.120]  But it seems like everywhere I go, there's a huge weight lifted off of people's shoulders because they're not under this ridiculous pressure.
[02:18:56.299 --> 02:19:01.770]  All the stuff that people went through in October And so I think we're going to see a lot more of that.
[02:19:01.909 --> 02:19:06.510]  They're going to try and gaslight people more, but it looks like Twitter is the complete antidote for that.
[02:19:06.969 --> 02:19:13.430]  Nobody was hanging on, like, Brett Baer's words about whether they're going to call a certain state like they were four years ago.
[02:19:13.450 --> 02:19:18.950]  Everybody was on independent live streams pretty much dunking on the media and making fun of all the lies.
[02:19:18.989 --> 02:19:19.469]  That's right, Mark.
[02:19:19.670 --> 02:19:21.270]  So it is definitely a new world, yeah.
[02:19:21.649 --> 02:19:22.729]  Sorry, a new world.
[02:19:22.750 --> 02:19:23.450]  I was about to say...
[02:19:24.020 --> 02:19:26.440]  A new world, a whole new paradigm is what I was going to say.
[02:19:26.979 --> 02:19:28.559]  This isn't just about getting Trump in.
[02:19:28.620 --> 02:19:33.299]  It's about the propaganda, the bullying, the lies of the system being broken in front of everyone.
[02:19:33.459 --> 02:19:38.079]  The system was discredited a long time ago, but now even New Yorker Magazine says mainstream media is dead.
[02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:42.540]  Well, yeah, it's like a skeleton in a coffin 10 years later figuring out it died if it was still alive.
[02:19:42.799 --> 02:19:45.340]  No, I mean, this is a repudiation.
[02:19:45.340 --> 02:19:48.739]  It's the Great Awakening, and the establishment now understands.
[02:19:48.739 --> 02:20:02.620]  I mean, we even have top Hollywood people I'm out of politics.
[02:20:02.860 --> 02:20:04.479]  They are throwing in the towel.
[02:20:04.639 --> 02:20:04.799]  Wow.
[02:20:10.459 --> 02:20:11.659]  Global realignment, as you know.
[02:20:12.079 --> 02:20:16.079]  Germany's trying to ban the Alternative for Deutschland party because it's taking over.
[02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:17.520]  That's not going to work out.
[02:20:17.799 --> 02:20:18.440]  Sure, they ban it.
[02:20:18.600 --> 02:20:19.319]  It makes it even bigger.
[02:20:19.500 --> 02:20:20.620]  I mean, it'll be a new name.
[02:20:21.059 --> 02:20:23.799]  So freedom is an idea whose time has come.
[02:20:23.959 --> 02:20:25.780]  As Ron Paul used to say, it's happening.
[02:20:25.959 --> 02:20:27.620]  Ron Paul's going to be advising the administration.
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:29.200]  This is a new renaissance.
[02:20:29.379 --> 02:20:34.459]  If we could just stop them starting World War III, I've got a lot of optimism, Mark, going into the future.
[02:20:36.219 --> 02:20:37.639]  Absolutely, 100%.
[02:20:37.639 --> 02:20:48.440]  In my opinion, it's not unfair to call this cult-like behavior because I've shown in the polling, people who watch MSNBC, their number one issue was the threat to democracy, a made-up issue, 46% of them.
[02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:50.979]  And then the second most highest issue was abortion.
[02:20:51.340 --> 02:20:52.959]  Trump's not taking anybody's abortion away.
[02:20:53.079 --> 02:20:57.530]  So they are laser-focused on fake issues that were sold to them As fear.
[02:20:57.670 --> 02:21:00.170]  They were voting against Trump because of fear.
[02:21:00.370 --> 02:21:04.170]  And the thing about cults, a dying cult, is people bounce.
[02:21:04.350 --> 02:21:05.709]  People can't take it anymore.
[02:21:05.909 --> 02:21:09.690]  And yet the people who remain become even more ingrained in the ideology.
[02:21:10.030 --> 02:21:11.010]  Oh, Mark, I know you've got to go.
[02:21:11.069 --> 02:21:12.149]  So we've got to go to a quick break.
[02:21:12.250 --> 02:21:12.690]  We'll come back.
[02:21:12.770 --> 02:21:13.629]  You'll be gone by the time you leave.
[02:21:13.649 --> 02:21:15.930]  I want to elaborate finally on that key point you just made.
[02:21:16.090 --> 02:21:16.549]  Straight ahead.
[02:21:16.670 --> 02:21:17.649]  Mark Mitchell, head of Rasmussen.
[02:21:18.170 --> 02:21:28.889]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I say I'm excited about bringing you the ultimate gut cleanse, exclusively available at thealexjonesstore.com, I'm not joking around.
[02:21:29.069 --> 02:21:32.370]  We don't sit there and shoot in the dark.
[02:21:32.670 --> 02:21:43.110]  We go out and we find what are already the best-selling, highest-rated products in the country, and we say, hey, we'd like to private label it, but we'd like you to make it a little bit stronger for us so it's proprietary.
[02:21:43.670 --> 02:21:44.950]  You got it right here.
[02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:46.729]  The ultimate gut cleanse.
[02:21:46.850 --> 02:21:48.450]  This is not just a gut cleanse.
[02:21:48.809 --> 02:21:49.950]  It's not just a detox.
[02:21:50.190 --> 02:21:53.229]  It doesn't just have natural ingredients that gently get rid of parasites.
[02:21:53.530 --> 02:21:54.569]  Oh, it's got that covered.
[02:21:54.909 --> 02:21:58.989]  It's then got a whole bunch of stuff in it like saw palmetto that's good for all your glands.
[02:21:59.250 --> 02:22:01.930]  And even the government admits great for men's prostates.
[02:22:02.260 --> 02:22:04.139]  And it goes on and on.
[02:22:04.319 --> 02:22:05.860]  I cannot read all the ingredients.
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:07.020]  They're concentrated.
[02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:08.079]  They're incredible.
[02:22:08.500 --> 02:22:13.520]  You want to get it right now at thealexjonesstore.com for between 30 and 50% off.
[02:22:13.659 --> 02:22:16.920]  50% off for you to the combo and get it with the ultimate probiotic.
[02:22:18.069 --> 02:22:24.469]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, nobody has nailed it in the last three or four elections like Rasmussen.
[02:22:24.590 --> 02:22:27.030]  Their head of polling, Mark Mitchell, is here with us.
[02:22:27.149 --> 02:22:33.129]  He's got to leave in a few minutes, but Mark, recap what you were saying earlier about what you really take away from this historic election.
[02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:41.129]  And then you were talking about the cult, and you were saying that what happens when cults finally get exposed?
[02:22:42.739 --> 02:22:43.399]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:48.280]  Listen, public opinion professional for decades, this company's been in business.
[02:22:48.399 --> 02:23:00.940]  And it's really weird, year after year after year, the trend we've been noticing is increasingly voters do not get what they want out of DC. Donald Trump comes along and shines a pretty big spotlight on exactly why.
[02:23:01.100 --> 02:23:03.379]  And listen, it was really touch and go last week.
[02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:07.079]  The people really turned out and gave Donald Trump a massive win.
[02:23:07.239 --> 02:23:09.739]  And yet he almost Didn't get it.
[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:15.620]  And it's really crazy, but the people got what they want, and now a cornered animal is at its most desperate.
[02:23:15.860 --> 02:23:20.819]  To get to as tight as it was, they literally brainwashed millions of people here.
[02:23:21.479 --> 02:23:27.979]  MSNBC viewers have a totally different view of America than people who watch different news outlets, than people who look at independent news.
[02:23:28.270 --> 02:23:29.969]  And the absolute numbers are crazy.
[02:23:30.170 --> 02:23:39.610]  They convinced 24% of the electorate that protecting our democracy is the number one issue the next president has to solve and another 14% abortion.
[02:23:39.889 --> 02:23:42.209]  And as we all know, that's an anti-Trump signal.
[02:23:42.350 --> 02:23:44.209]  So that's 38% of this country.
[02:23:44.389 --> 02:23:58.569]  Now, that number is getting smaller and smaller, and that's because the amount of insane gaslighting that they've had to do is starting to take its toll, and people are going to wake up and leave the Democrat plantation that is literally crazyville.
[02:23:58.750 --> 02:24:13.620]  But then the other problem is that other people are just going to double down hard, and that creates a really dangerous problem where a lot of people are radicalized, and then the government, they have incentives to play into that to try and prevent A change in the status quo.
[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:21.819]  So in my personal opinion, this country has been lacking justice, it's been lacking accountability, and it's even been lacking reality.
[02:24:21.879 --> 02:24:31.840]  I think the media is to blame a lot for all of the pain that people are in right now, just enabling this insane leftist platform of luxury beliefs that are anti-American.
[02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:33.540]  People just want America back.
[02:24:33.739 --> 02:24:38.079]  That's what they voted for, and I don't think the people in D.C. are gonna give it away easily.
[02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:53.579]  And as you said before the break, just I want your own words, and as you got cut off, You were making the great point that in cults, when they finally get exposed, most of the cult leaves and wakes up, but those that stay in it get even more insane, and we have this B4 movement, shaving their heads,
[02:24:53.659 --> 02:24:54.739]  saying they're going to kill their husbands.
[02:24:55.079 --> 02:24:56.860]  I mean, this is wild.
[02:24:56.860 --> 02:24:58.200]  Is there any way to reach these people?
[02:24:59.799 --> 02:25:01.139]  You're never gonna reach everybody.
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:04.000]  And that's why, I mean, I get flack for saying this.
[02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:06.819]  I think ridicule is a very powerful tool.
[02:25:06.959 --> 02:25:08.819]  And I do feel sorry for these people.
[02:25:08.959 --> 02:25:10.959]  Listen, Donald Trump did this in 2016.
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:14.680]  If somebody came on board his movement, he'd get him a coat.
[02:25:14.879 --> 02:25:21.340]  And so if people Have honest introspection, change their ways, understand their lapse of reality.
[02:25:21.340 --> 02:25:25.920]  I think that they should be treated kindly and welcomed into the movement.
[02:25:26.159 --> 02:25:29.879]  But I mean, look at like Alan Lichman, which made an absolute clown of himself.
[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:32.959]  He came out and said, oh gee, sorry guys, I missed it.
[02:25:33.139 --> 02:25:34.260]  But it wasn't my fault.
[02:25:34.420 --> 02:25:38.420]  And so I think that the leftist Democrats are really bad at introspection.
[02:25:38.659 --> 02:25:42.399]  Some of them, I've seen a lot of videos of people saying, wow, I was lied to.
[02:25:42.579 --> 02:25:43.639]  I just wanted to be right.
[02:25:44.049 --> 02:25:44.989]  And it's sad.
[02:25:45.090 --> 02:25:46.629]  I feel really bad for those people.
[02:25:46.829 --> 02:25:47.969]  It's driven apart families.
[02:25:48.489 --> 02:25:51.270]  But it's like, no, you can't have your way.
[02:25:51.450 --> 02:25:56.270]  I think being a parent of young toddlers has taught me very well public opinion.
[02:25:56.270 --> 02:25:59.290]  It's like if somebody misbehaves, you have to go in the corner.
[02:25:59.489 --> 02:26:03.870]  You don't come out until you say sorry, but you can't get away with this insane behavior.
[02:26:04.299 --> 02:26:08.840]  And so it's almost like an intervention, I think, that these people should go through.
[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:16.319]  But again, MSNBC, like if you, introspection MSNBC, should you give an olive branch?
[02:26:16.579 --> 02:26:20.180]  Are you going to, you know, lick your wounds and figure out what you did wrong?
[02:26:20.180 --> 02:26:21.200]  It doesn't look like it.
[02:26:21.620 --> 02:26:27.040]  Oh, instead, Rachel Maddow says the military needs to stop Trump, but Democrats need to be aggressive pirates.
[02:26:27.260 --> 02:26:28.659]  In closing, I know you got to go.
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:31.620]  Mark Mitchell from Raspus, congratulations on literally nailing it.
[02:26:31.659 --> 02:26:32.360]  Nobody else did that.
[02:26:33.030 --> 02:26:36.930]  You've got suicides all over the place connected to Trump's win.
[02:26:37.229 --> 02:26:42.809]  You've got fathers murdering his wife, ex-wife, and kids because the world was going to be so bad under Trump.
[02:26:43.170 --> 02:26:44.370]  I mean, this is not Trump.
[02:26:44.549 --> 02:26:45.850]  This is not the American people.
[02:26:46.090 --> 02:26:48.450]  This is a cult, and it's dangerous.
[02:26:48.750 --> 02:26:50.069]  Mark Mitchell, thank you so much.
[02:26:51.079 --> 02:26:51.760]  Happy to be here.
[02:26:52.239 --> 02:26:53.559]  Wow, powerful interview.
[02:26:54.260 --> 02:27:01.219]  And we're going to post this live interview, the clips of it, on X and on InfoWars in the next 30 minutes, and it's going to get 20 million views.
[02:27:01.219 --> 02:27:01.879]  You know it is.
[02:27:02.340 --> 02:27:03.680]  Because that guy's very respected.
[02:27:03.680 --> 02:27:04.959]  He just said, no, the evidence is overwhelming.
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:09.819]  They tried to steal the 2024 election, and they failed.
[02:27:10.299 --> 02:27:16.940]  And as Owen said at 1030 at night, it was looking bad because he was winning all those states, and they froze it.
[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:18.879]  And we were sitting there for like an hour.
[02:27:20.149 --> 02:27:23.329]  And the totals are going up for Trump, and he's widening his lead.
[02:27:23.729 --> 02:27:29.149]  And then, bloop, totals stop in Georgia, in Pennsylvania, in Michigan, in the key states.
[02:27:29.989 --> 02:27:33.569]  And we're like, oh my God, are the trucks rolling in?
[02:27:33.649 --> 02:27:34.989]  Are the vans rolling in?
[02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:36.809]  Are the post office trucks rolling in?
[02:27:37.370 --> 02:27:39.809]  Are the foreign out-of-state plates rolling?
[02:27:40.959 --> 02:27:43.860]  And sure enough, California, Rhode Island, trucks.
[02:27:45.059 --> 02:27:47.079]  Oh, counting stops.
[02:27:47.299 --> 02:27:48.860]  Oh, let's cover up the windows.
[02:27:49.059 --> 02:27:50.120]  Oh, come on in.
[02:27:51.260 --> 02:27:54.180]  When they got there, the Trump lawyers had already sued.
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:55.020]  They were blocked everywhere.
[02:27:55.399 --> 02:27:58.260]  Months before the election, they had to sue and win to be there.
[02:27:58.420 --> 02:28:01.360]  They're like, oh, yeah, bring those on in.
[02:28:01.479 --> 02:28:02.360]  What's in those boxes?
[02:28:02.559 --> 02:28:03.020]  Never mind.
[02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:05.299]  Never mind what's in these.
[02:28:05.459 --> 02:28:07.500]  We'll just leave with these.
[02:28:07.979 --> 02:28:09.379]  These boxes aren't ballots.
[02:28:09.540 --> 02:28:10.219]  It's our lunch.
[02:28:10.399 --> 02:28:10.739]  It's donuts.
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:12.479]  We'll just take these over here.
[02:28:13.020 --> 02:28:13.239]  Yeah.
[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:19.420]  And they sued all these innocent people that said, wow, look at them in Georgia.
[02:28:20.379 --> 02:28:21.319]  Covering up the windows.
[02:28:21.479 --> 02:28:22.399]  Saying a water main broke.
[02:28:22.540 --> 02:28:23.260]  Didn't break.
[02:28:23.639 --> 02:28:26.520]  Key Democrat operatives with boxes of ballots.
[02:28:26.540 --> 02:28:28.459]  Once we got the surveillance footage inside the building.
[02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:30.860]  Cramming them in the machines and looking around them.
[02:28:31.599 --> 02:28:34.459]  And they go to a key jurisdiction, sue Giuliani.
[02:28:34.739 --> 02:28:38.379]  How dare Giuliani lie about these innocent people who did absolutely nothing?
[02:28:38.479 --> 02:28:39.299]  Of course, I know that.
[02:28:39.979 --> 02:28:42.000]  $87 million you owe, Giuliani.
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:44.020]  We're going to take your house.
[02:28:44.219 --> 02:28:46.219]  We're going to take your bank accounts, you meanie.
[02:28:47.700 --> 02:28:49.399]  And you, Alex Jones, why?
[02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:52.319]  You went and peed on kids' graves and you attacked their families.
[02:28:52.379 --> 02:28:52.959]  None of that happened.
[02:28:53.079 --> 02:28:53.620]  Totally made up.
[02:28:53.719 --> 02:28:54.200]  Nobody did.
[02:28:55.340 --> 02:28:57.680]  Red court case, already found guilty by judges.
[02:28:57.920 --> 02:28:59.440]  Show trial, HBO production.
[02:29:03.290 --> 02:29:08.170]  And I knew it was an HBO production, but they had one trial and a month later another trial.
[02:29:08.309 --> 02:29:15.840]  Texas and Connecticut all coordinated And I start, by the second show trial, I knew it was already staged, but I noticed they were following exact scripts.
[02:29:15.940 --> 02:29:18.219]  We were giving an exact list of things I couldn't say like I was innocent.
[02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:20.840]  And I was looking on the judge's desk when I'm up there testifying.
[02:29:20.959 --> 02:29:22.860]  I'm like, I've seen the same notes I saw in Texas.
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:23.719]  What is that?
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000]  Oh my God, this is completely scripted.
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:28.420]  I mean, these people think they're fighting Hitler.
[02:29:28.780 --> 02:29:36.299]  So to them, doing incredibly illegal stuff, and that's illegal, that's conspiracy against rights to rig trials completely.
[02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:41.889]  But to them it's like, well we're fighting Hitler, so it's for a good cause.
[02:29:42.930 --> 02:29:44.930]  No, you're not the French Resistance.
[02:29:44.930 --> 02:29:46.290]  I'm not Adolf Hitler.
[02:29:46.590 --> 02:29:47.989]  Trump's not Adolf Hitler.
[02:29:48.389 --> 02:29:52.530]  You work for Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, the New World Order, BlackRock.
[02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:54.610]  You work for the bad guys.
[02:29:54.610 --> 02:29:56.030]  You're the bad people.
[02:29:56.350 --> 02:30:09.129]  You're the ones with your party shipping in 325,000 kids as of two months ago, three months ago growing that have completely been disappeared on purpose and then we've handed out for sex slavery and slave labor.
[02:30:09.329 --> 02:30:11.930]  I mean, You are the bad guys.
[02:30:11.930 --> 02:30:14.329]  You are the villains, not us.
[02:30:14.709 --> 02:30:19.290]  We just don't want to have World War III. We want cheap energy and security and a future.
[02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:24.850]  And all your intimidation.
[02:30:28.090 --> 02:30:31.670]  How's that working out for you?
[02:30:33.069 --> 02:30:38.399]  And so Trump started, you know, tweeting, hey, Looks like big fraud.
[02:30:38.559 --> 02:30:49.040]  Well, yeah, I mean, speaking of James O'Keefe, he caught them with the NGOs next door, across the street, with the illegal aliens voting, and when they walk up, oh, you're illegal aliens voting.
[02:30:49.219 --> 02:30:50.280]  Yeah, illegal aliens can vote.
[02:30:50.360 --> 02:30:50.719]  Come on in.
[02:30:51.719 --> 02:30:52.420]  I'm not a citizen.
[02:30:52.559 --> 02:30:52.819]  Can I vote?
[02:30:52.920 --> 02:30:53.440]  Yep, come on in.
[02:30:57.319 --> 02:30:59.760]  And people don't care about courts ruling illegals can vote.
[02:30:59.959 --> 02:31:00.940]  That's what I care about.
[02:31:01.520 --> 02:31:03.319]  Oh, a court ruled illegals can vote in all these states.
[02:31:03.659 --> 02:31:06.860]  Oh, but you have footage of them saying, come on, illegal to vote?
[02:31:07.040 --> 02:31:08.239]  People want to see it.
[02:31:09.440 --> 02:31:10.620]  They want to see it.
[02:31:12.459 --> 02:31:15.319]  And then Pennsylvania, oh, we're closing down.
[02:31:15.479 --> 02:31:16.200]  We're stopping counting.
[02:31:16.459 --> 02:31:18.639]  Oh, meanwhile, there's counting inside.
[02:31:20.500 --> 02:31:22.000]  And then the cops show up.
[02:31:23.899 --> 02:31:25.360]  And the Trump lawyers are there.
[02:31:26.159 --> 02:31:27.799]  With their elbow on the desk while they're doing it.
[02:31:27.899 --> 02:31:29.520]  Okay, you're going to put those in the machine, huh?
[02:31:30.739 --> 02:31:32.340]  You're going to commit that felony right in front of me?
[02:31:32.719 --> 02:31:34.120]  Oh, no, actually, Trump won.
[02:31:37.840 --> 02:31:45.479]  So, we have to expose everything in 2020 that took years to have come out, and it's all been proven.
[02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:47.750]  Expose 2024.
[02:31:48.770 --> 02:31:49.590]  Expose 2022.
[02:31:50.030 --> 02:31:52.489]  And then we're going to have their ass in two years.
[02:31:53.209 --> 02:31:55.930]  Yeah, those 10 million votes that just didn't show up.
[02:31:56.290 --> 02:31:58.530]  10 million Kamala voters just didn't show up.
[02:31:58.590 --> 02:32:00.309]  Yeah, you bet they didn't show up because they never existed.
[02:32:03.149 --> 02:32:05.530]  And they preloaded as much fraud as they could in early.
[02:32:07.209 --> 02:32:12.069]  And that's why on the battlegrounds, here's Trump winning 7-10 points over what he did everywhere else.
[02:32:12.649 --> 02:32:15.510]  But in the battlegrounds, he only won by a point and a half.
[02:32:16.969 --> 02:32:17.569]  On average.
[02:32:18.409 --> 02:32:20.489]  And it was enough to get over the fraud.
[02:32:21.149 --> 02:32:22.850]  It was just enough.
[02:32:23.209 --> 02:32:25.430]  Like I told you, massive landslides.
[02:32:26.090 --> 02:32:28.149]  And I could talk for 10 days on this.
[02:32:28.250 --> 02:32:30.110]  I've been covering election fraud for 30 years.
[02:32:30.250 --> 02:32:31.149]  I've had so many experts on.
[02:32:31.270 --> 02:32:32.209]  I study it myself.
[02:32:33.370 --> 02:32:35.909]  And there's only so much fraud baked in.
[02:32:36.049 --> 02:32:37.309]  I mean, here's a simple way to understand it.
[02:32:38.329 --> 02:32:41.090]  If 100% of potential voters voted...
[02:32:43.040 --> 02:32:48.520]  And you have a vote total of, let's say, 290 million people voting.
[02:32:50.860 --> 02:32:53.059]  And Trump gets 80% of the vote.
[02:32:55.719 --> 02:32:59.479]  You can't then claim the 20% of the electorate could overpower that.
[02:33:00.180 --> 02:33:01.399]  Because they're just not the numbers.
[02:33:01.520 --> 02:33:03.860]  Now, that's an extreme example, but that's how it works.
[02:33:04.299 --> 02:33:07.020]  And I tried to explain it to people, and I got a lot of apologize.
[02:33:07.420 --> 02:33:08.639]  A lot of people apologized online.
[02:33:08.899 --> 02:33:12.139]  A lot of folks apologized on X. I apologize, Alex Jones.
[02:33:12.280 --> 02:33:14.299]  I didn't vote because I thought you couldn't overpower an election.
[02:33:14.559 --> 02:33:15.459]  Well, you didn't do the math.
[02:33:18.159 --> 02:33:25.319]  So, I mean, I'm not a rocket scientist like Elon Musk, but, I mean, this kind of stuff's real simple.
[02:33:27.659 --> 02:33:31.399]  And so we had eyes and ears on all of their shenanigans.
[02:33:33.639 --> 02:33:37.219]  And they were still able to steal a lot of crap, like this Carrie Lake thing.
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.079]  They hate her guts.
[02:33:40.639 --> 02:33:43.420]  Trump has record turnout, wins huge in Arizona.
[02:33:44.719 --> 02:33:47.620]  And then in key areas, they just hold back the ballots.
[02:33:49.659 --> 02:33:52.420]  And Lake goes, you watch, we keep counting, I'm going to go up.
[02:33:53.239 --> 02:34:01.219]  And she started, almost was about to win, and then bloop, they closed the polling places, and then they wake up, and was it?
[02:34:01.739 --> 02:34:09.219]  The tabulation centers, not the polling places, and then we wake up Sunday morning, I'm sorry, she lost.
[02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:12.059]  And now there's a criminal investigation.
[02:34:12.879 --> 02:34:17.180]  And we caught them in the previous general election.
[02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:21.100]  And so now it's all coming out.
[02:34:21.260 --> 02:34:37.819]  It took four years, but what happened on Sunday, two days before the general election, Citizen AG Group wins the lawsuit in Arizona and the federal judge says,
[02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:42.340]  yeah, that 1,200,000 people that for four years you won't release because of a glitch?
[02:34:44.930 --> 02:34:46.750]  They voted, but you don't know who they are.
[02:34:46.829 --> 02:34:48.989]  They weren't checked on the voter rolls because of a glitch.
[02:34:50.469 --> 02:34:51.850]  You got to release those now.
[02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:53.569]  And you know what's going to be in those.
[02:34:54.430 --> 02:34:55.770]  And they're still sitting on it.
[02:34:55.889 --> 02:35:00.049]  And the judge soon will put in contempt of court.
[02:35:00.489 --> 02:35:01.389]  They'll get arrested.
[02:35:02.149 --> 02:35:06.250]  Boy, why are they fighting like the devil in Michigan?
[02:35:06.649 --> 02:35:08.370]  And the devil in Georgia?
[02:35:08.610 --> 02:35:10.170]  And the devil in Pennsylvania?
[02:35:10.450 --> 02:35:11.530]  And the devil in Wisconsin?
[02:35:11.709 --> 02:35:12.649]  And the devil in Arizona?
[02:35:14.409 --> 02:35:15.629]  And the devil in California.
[02:35:15.950 --> 02:35:19.270]  Why are they fighting to never have any of this released?
[02:35:21.450 --> 02:35:33.610]  For almost four years, Michigan, the news, the Soros Attorney General, all said, there's not 500,000.
[02:35:33.750 --> 02:35:35.030]  There's not 200,000.
[02:35:35.170 --> 02:35:40.170]  There's no people that aren't supposed to be on the voter rolls that have never been registered to vote.
[02:35:40.309 --> 02:35:41.129]  That's made up.
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:50.440]  And then lawsuits by the Republican Party in the past few years come to a head because they kept stalling and stalling.
[02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:51.739]  And finally, judges said, no, release it.
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:57.739]  And Michigan goes, a week before the election, yeah, there's 500,000 people that have never been on the voter rolls.
[02:35:57.840 --> 02:35:58.579]  We don't know why they're on there.
[02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:00.120]  We don't know how they got on there, but they're allowed to vote.
[02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:01.459]  Just no big deal.
[02:36:02.559 --> 02:36:06.760]  And it takes so much time in court, there wasn't time to get more suits going to make them take them off.
[02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:12.379]  So 500,000 tandem people that weren't on the voter rolls.
[02:36:13.299 --> 02:36:15.139]  Oh, and by the way, remember what happened the week before?
[02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:16.620]  They didn't just vote.
[02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:26.239]  They had glitches where individuals on that list that had never been voters were voting in some cases thousands of times apiece.
[02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:33.840]  And now you see it.
[02:36:36.069 --> 02:36:37.229]  This stack of news right here.
[02:36:37.649 --> 02:36:43.209]  Four counties in Michigan find over 26,000 votes days after the election.
[02:36:43.450 --> 02:36:50.370]  Several seats flip from Democrats to Republicans, including one Michigan House seat.
[02:36:51.930 --> 02:36:53.649]  Oh, and it's a glitch.
[02:36:54.629 --> 02:37:05.809]  You know, I would never do this, but let's just say I got home tonight at 6 o'clock, my wife's cooking dinner, and like some bad men do, and I just walked over and broke her nose with the right...
[02:37:07.130 --> 02:37:07.450]  Jab.
[02:37:09.170 --> 02:37:10.370]  And the cops show up.
[02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:12.610]  And her nose is broken.
[02:37:12.770 --> 02:37:13.209]  There's blood everywhere.
[02:37:13.489 --> 02:37:14.770]  And I say, your officer, it was a glitch.
[02:37:17.090 --> 02:37:19.010]  The cops say, turn around, you're in handcuffs.
[02:37:19.790 --> 02:37:22.010]  You're being arrested for family violence and assault.
[02:37:26.149 --> 02:37:29.409]  You know, when a bank robber goes into a bank and says, stick them up, put the money in the bag.
[02:37:30.010 --> 02:37:30.969]  Is that a glitch?
[02:37:32.069 --> 02:37:35.149]  When Jeffrey Dahmer kidnapped people and tortured them to death, was that a glitch?
[02:37:39.310 --> 02:37:47.170]  When Mayorkas and Harris and all them and Biden said, when I win, immediately surged the border and they set up NGOs to bring the illegals up here and traffic the kids.
[02:37:48.030 --> 02:37:57.370]  Was it a glitch when they ordered all the DNA testing of the kids that takes like a day and super cheap to know they were with their families when they got rid of that even though it was congressionally funded and apportioned?
[02:37:58.889 --> 02:37:59.290]  No.
[02:37:59.889 --> 02:38:06.549]  If I see Fox News or any other Republicans one more time Go, Harris lost kids.
[02:38:07.489 --> 02:38:08.629]  Mayorkas was an idiot.
[02:38:09.270 --> 02:38:10.389]  Mayorkas did a terrible job.
[02:38:10.530 --> 02:38:11.950]  He didn't do a terrible job.
[02:38:15.969 --> 02:38:22.430]  You know, the gunman that blew Kennedy's head off in Dallas, Texas in 1963 didn't do a terrible job.
[02:38:22.430 --> 02:38:23.350]  He didn't have a glitch.
[02:38:23.590 --> 02:38:26.469]  He shot him right in the front of the head and blew the back of his head off.
[02:38:30.170 --> 02:38:34.170]  When Tom Brady threw for all those touchdowns, he didn't glitch.
[02:38:34.170 --> 02:38:35.069]  He did that on purpose.
[02:38:37.629 --> 02:38:40.590]  When they stole the 2020 election, that wasn't a glitch.
[02:38:41.229 --> 02:38:46.610]  When all over the country, voting machines from Dominion, you name it, were always flipping votes.
[02:38:46.909 --> 02:38:54.530]  Why every time was it that we saw on the news, people videotaped it, was it flipped from Republican to Democrat straight ticket?
[02:38:55.090 --> 02:38:56.530]  That's not a glitch.
[02:39:02.049 --> 02:39:03.469]  Oh, the Democrats are idiots.
[02:39:03.670 --> 02:39:04.969]  They want to cut off fossil fuels.
[02:39:05.350 --> 02:39:08.690]  Estimates are if you cut off all the fossil fuels, half the earth would die within 10 years.
[02:39:08.909 --> 02:39:10.209]  That's not misguided.
[02:39:10.430 --> 02:39:13.129]  That's a depopulation agenda, and they admit that's why they're doing it.
[02:39:13.530 --> 02:39:15.510]  Stop saying they're idiots.
[02:39:15.950 --> 02:39:17.690]  Stop saying they're morons.
[02:39:18.069 --> 02:39:19.389]  Stop saying they're crazy.
[02:39:21.069 --> 02:39:22.270]  Environmentalist wackos.
[02:39:24.209 --> 02:39:27.389]  I mean, I knew that listening to Limbaugh 30-something years ago before I even had a show.
[02:39:27.649 --> 02:39:33.069]  I'd hear him, you know, playing those funny musics like we're mean to chainsaw and environmentalist wackos.
[02:39:33.909 --> 02:39:38.030]  Yeah, their followers are wackos, but the people doing all this are not wackos.
[02:39:38.069 --> 02:39:39.469]  And I know the listeners are like, we know this, Alex.
[02:39:39.750 --> 02:39:40.909]  Well, I'm not talking to you.
[02:39:40.989 --> 02:39:41.569]  You're awesome.
[02:39:42.129 --> 02:39:43.989]  But we gotta get the people that don't know.
[02:39:44.270 --> 02:39:47.950]  These women, they're shaving their heads because they think Trump's coming to get them.
[02:39:48.149 --> 02:39:49.889]  No, he's anti-globalist.
[02:39:50.010 --> 02:39:51.229]  He just wants prosperity.
[02:39:51.590 --> 02:40:02.809]  Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and King Charles literally want to take your resources and starve you to death and inject you with poison shots that are not vaccines and make you eat poison chitin bug protein.
[02:40:05.590 --> 02:40:21.010]  Do you women that love the system understand that we have actuaries from insurance companies, thousands of major studies, government studies from Italy and Japan and the U.S. and England, that these mRNA shots turn off your immune system and fry your body, cardiovascular, and attack your organs?
[02:40:22.469 --> 02:40:25.350]  I mean, the New World Order wants you dead.
[02:40:27.209 --> 02:40:29.290]  But see, that's the ultimate Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:40:29.489 --> 02:40:33.930]  They're afraid I'm coming to put them in camps and Trump's coming to kill them in the military with no evidence?
[02:40:35.170 --> 02:40:40.430]  While their own bosses sign executive orders to try it, that's still in the books, for the next 69 days while they're still in power?
[02:40:42.350 --> 02:40:44.530]  And the U.S. military prepared to kill citizens?
[02:40:45.790 --> 02:40:50.409]  And then they shave their heads in grandstand, because we're going to put them in camps?
[02:40:51.489 --> 02:40:59.190]  When it's Bill Gates and the New World Order that want to turn everything into a giant, open-air prison.
[02:40:59.290 --> 02:41:00.629]  Yeah, there's the ultimate compilation.
[02:41:03.729 --> 02:41:04.469]  Part 4.
[02:41:07.469 --> 02:41:08.729]  We should probably say par, but that's fine.
[02:41:09.129 --> 02:41:12.489]  Of insane leftist women shaving their heads in protest of Trump's huge election victory.
[02:41:14.370 --> 02:41:17.149]  Reminds me of women in the Charles Manson cult.
[02:41:20.170 --> 02:41:24.190]  And I think they're like showing you, like, I'm not going to be pretty for you.
[02:41:24.469 --> 02:41:25.290]  Well, look at the left.
[02:41:25.389 --> 02:41:27.690]  They don't want the image of feminine women and all the rest of it.
[02:41:27.889 --> 02:41:31.229]  These women are into the whole CIA, don't be a woman thing.
[02:41:32.510 --> 02:41:40.590]  And they're totally spoiled brat morons raised by their leftist parents, brainwashed in the schools.
[02:41:41.889 --> 02:41:43.649]  You know, they all see psychiatrists.
[02:41:43.770 --> 02:41:45.690]  They're all in a bunch of prescription drugs.
[02:41:46.649 --> 02:41:50.030]  And you look at them and it's like, God, lady, what have they done to you?
[02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:54.870]  They are literally pimped out by the New World Order system.
[02:41:58.350 --> 02:42:05.940]  And they're throwing a temper tantrum And they're separately running around saying they're going to poison their husbands.
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:11.760]  In fact, let's put out another compilation because without trying to look, I'm not even looking for this.
[02:42:12.379 --> 02:42:13.579]  I forgot to tell the crew this.
[02:42:13.739 --> 02:42:19.879]  I've seen at least 30 plus videos in the last couple days, in the last six, seven days.
[02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:24.780]  Well, since the election, six days.
[02:42:26.879 --> 02:42:30.899]  Of women, prominent ones, saying, here's how you poison your husband.
[02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:32.899]  Here's the poisons you use.
[02:42:33.139 --> 02:42:38.000]  Hey, dumbass, if you kill your husband, there's a very good chance there's going to be an autopsy.
[02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:41.659]  They're going to find the poison, and you're going to get indicted.
[02:42:43.780 --> 02:42:52.360]  You're so whacked out, you want to kill your husband or boyfriend now, because you know, if you just kill your husband, then Bill Gates can save us.
[02:42:52.879 --> 02:42:55.540]  What have they done to you?
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:02.020]  Alright, we're going to go to break.
[02:43:02.219 --> 02:43:02.879]  Come back with Owen.
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:04.420]  We'll look at the races that are still open.
[02:43:04.559 --> 02:43:05.559]  How big is the trifecta?
[02:43:05.639 --> 02:43:06.500]  Could they steal the house?
[02:43:06.639 --> 02:43:07.139]  They're close.
[02:43:07.959 --> 02:43:09.200]  We're all busy celebrating.
[02:43:10.040 --> 02:43:11.579]  How does Owen think they're going to strike back?
[02:43:13.799 --> 02:43:14.700]  It's all coming up.
[02:43:14.879 --> 02:43:19.440]  And listen, the New World Order is still announcing they're going to arrest a bunch more J6ers.
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:23.459]  Biden and DOJ to arrest the most egregious J6ers before Trump takes office.
[02:43:24.510 --> 02:43:26.870]  Now, they've got all these other criminal cases going against people.
[02:43:26.930 --> 02:43:27.909]  I'm sure they've got them on me.
[02:43:28.030 --> 02:43:28.969]  I mean, it's just not fun.
[02:43:29.290 --> 02:43:30.409]  But hey, I signed up for this.
[02:43:30.510 --> 02:43:30.729]  It's fine.
[02:43:30.809 --> 02:43:31.469]  Unless we're seeing victory.
[02:43:34.049 --> 02:43:38.889]  But Wednesday, it goes on all day.
[02:43:39.049 --> 02:43:45.889]  Big online, federally ordered auction of the crew's equipment and the websites and all of it.
[02:43:46.129 --> 02:43:47.049]  So we've got backups.
[02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:52.360]  AlexJones.network.
[02:43:52.500 --> 02:43:54.819]  You go to the site, it's got some links and things, but it'll be a big news site.
[02:43:54.860 --> 02:43:55.959]  We have to do all that stuff.
[02:43:56.399 --> 02:44:00.860]  We got servers, we got equipment, we got studio, we need legal, satellite uplinks, all of it.
[02:44:01.020 --> 02:44:05.340]  And we've got it in place, 95% of the equipment and stuff's ready to go.
[02:44:05.420 --> 02:44:08.719]  We got a whole other bigger studio being finished and it just takes a lot of money.
[02:44:09.680 --> 02:44:12.479]  And we've got great products you need.
[02:44:12.620 --> 02:44:20.079]  So just understand, you got victory because you got off the bench and people weren't naive and you supported Trump.

[02:45:37.920 --> 02:45:40.139]  And people know I don't BS on my children.
[02:45:40.159 --> 02:45:41.219]  I don't have enough funds.
[02:45:41.659 --> 02:45:42.799]  And it's very stressful.
[02:45:42.799 --> 02:45:44.040]  And I believe God's going to come through.
[02:45:44.159 --> 02:45:46.540]  And if they do shut us down Wednesday, people go, really?

[02:45:55.299 --> 02:45:56.579]  I'd have more reporters, more crew.
[02:45:56.680 --> 02:45:57.879]  I mean, we are kicking ass.
[02:45:58.040 --> 02:46:00.379]  We're reaching 80 million people conservatively a day right now.

[02:46:33.639 --> 02:46:34.440]  They're coming after Trump.
[02:46:34.559 --> 02:46:35.280]  They're coming after Kennedy.
[02:46:35.540 --> 02:46:36.360]  We need your support.
[02:46:36.420 --> 02:46:37.379]  And you don't even come here and do this.
[02:46:37.489 --> 02:46:38.850]  Alex, first of all, I want to thank you.
[02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:39.930]  Give to Alex Jones.
[02:46:40.129 --> 02:46:45.309]  I don't want this guy to have to be like wearing a symbol and we're all going to say, you know, the truth teller formerly known as Alex Jones.
[02:46:45.389 --> 02:46:46.569]  Let's not let that happen.
[02:46:46.809 --> 02:46:48.309]  Well, they're trying to make an example out of me.
[02:46:48.770 --> 02:46:51.309]  I'm not that important, but I've become a rallying point.
[02:46:51.430 --> 02:46:53.649]  I've become like a Roman standard they want to capture.
[02:46:53.829 --> 02:46:54.329]  Explain that.
[02:46:54.409 --> 02:46:54.729]  You're...
[02:46:54.889 --> 02:47:03.729]  Look, I mean, if we don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the First Amendment, if, you know, media, which is, look, it never said only newspapers or the media.
[02:47:03.729 --> 02:47:12.790]  It was anyone that wants to challenge government, anyone that's willing to put the feet to the fire of corporate interests of your government, that is supposed to be free.
[02:47:12.909 --> 02:47:13.969]  Electronic soapbox.
[02:47:14.190 --> 02:47:18.170]  In the end, if you lose, Alex, we all lose.
[02:47:18.290 --> 02:47:24.149]  We will all lose the ability to do tough stories, to take risks, to plant flags where we think there's an issue.
[02:47:24.350 --> 02:47:25.409]  Sometime we'll get it wrong.
[02:47:25.549 --> 02:47:27.469]  I said before, you do a daily show.
[02:47:27.610 --> 02:47:29.370]  It's impossible to nail that to the wall.
[02:47:29.450 --> 02:47:30.409]  I do a weekly show.
[02:47:30.530 --> 02:47:31.950]  I spend more time vetting it.
[02:47:32.069 --> 02:47:32.930]  They're two different animals.
[02:47:33.069 --> 02:47:34.090]  They can't be compared to each other.
[02:47:34.090 --> 02:47:35.469]  They also take stuff out of context.
[02:47:36.190 --> 02:47:37.430]  Absolutely, that's true.
[02:47:37.569 --> 02:47:46.120]  You know, one of the things that makes you so spectacular, Alex, is long before any of us were here, You were starting to talk about this deep state.
[02:47:46.299 --> 02:47:57.680]  You were talking about this, you know, a government that was supposed to be of, for, and by the people that was being robbed from us by corporate interests, by special interests, by globalists, long before anybody else ever did.
[02:47:58.239 --> 02:48:03.200]  And to imagine you sitting here in this moment, we are in that impactful moment.
[02:48:03.319 --> 02:48:05.500]  And in many ways, not enough people are listening to you.
[02:48:05.659 --> 02:48:21.020]  And I want to say that, you know, I think the vaccine, and we've talked about this before, that was the tip of the spear of the final death blow, which was, if we can inject you and own your bodies, and own the bodies of your children, and pass laws that say that, you know, because of vaccinations,
[02:48:21.020 --> 02:48:23.059]  we've decided that we own your children.
[02:48:23.219 --> 02:48:24.040]  We make your decisions.
[02:48:24.100 --> 02:48:25.500]  That's a revolutionary takeover.
[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:29.680]  It was a revolutionary takeover, and so people like me got alarmed by that.
[02:48:29.860 --> 02:48:34.280]  And we joined forces with people like you that have been really talking about it for a long time.
[02:48:34.440 --> 02:48:37.340]  But I would say that we're at the very last stage.
[02:48:37.420 --> 02:48:41.440]  I was just speaking publicly, and this woman said, things don't happen that fast, Del.
[02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:42.440]  You're being really dramatic.
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:44.780]  I don't think this election matters that much.
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:49.340]  I was like, that's because you're looking at this over the last year, maybe two years.
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:52.760]  There's people like Bobby that's been fighting the corporate establishment for four years.
[02:48:52.790 --> 02:49:02.569]  40 years as a lawyer that watched his father when he was 13 years old be killed for exactly this battle and his uncle when he was 10 years old.
[02:49:02.750 --> 02:49:14.729]  So depending on what window you look at this, we're really at the end stage of a takeover and destruction of the one thing that stands in the way of globalist thinking, which is the Constitution of the United States of America.
[02:49:16.190 --> 02:49:30.170]  We're good to go.
[02:49:35.690 --> 02:49:36.709]  It reminds you, go back to the store.
[02:49:36.850 --> 02:49:38.969]  Incredible supplements, the ultimate CMOS, superfood.
[02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:42.770]  It's all there at the Alex Jones store, thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:49:42.889 --> 02:49:45.370]  My dad's great supplement company, drjonesnationals.com.
[02:49:45.469 --> 02:49:48.430]  That's how we're funding this operation, separate from InfoWars.
[02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:50.870]  You go there, you get t-shirts, you get ball caps.
[02:49:51.059 --> 02:49:51.799]  You spread the word.
[02:49:51.940 --> 02:49:52.879]  You meet like-minded people.
[02:49:52.959 --> 02:49:54.139]  You're a walking billboard for freedom.
[02:49:54.219 --> 02:49:54.979]  It's a great adventure.
[02:49:55.159 --> 02:49:56.680]  And you know you're funding our operation.
[02:49:56.799 --> 02:49:57.459]  We need funds.
[02:49:57.520 --> 02:49:59.620]  And I'll go on the offense and just hope the money comes in.
[02:49:59.680 --> 02:50:00.659]  But we're going on the offense.
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:01.459]  We caught them.
[02:50:01.520 --> 02:50:02.219]  We got the documents.
[02:50:02.340 --> 02:50:04.559]  I told you I'll sue the CIA and FBI. Get ready.
[02:50:04.879 --> 02:50:06.059]  First steps start this week.
[02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:06.879]  And the enemy already knows.
[02:50:07.579 --> 02:50:09.680]  I'm just, but I need money to do it.
[02:50:09.719 --> 02:50:11.719]  And look, I don't even think about my life or any of that.
[02:50:11.799 --> 02:50:12.299]  That doesn't matter.
[02:50:12.399 --> 02:50:13.020]  I'm on this mission.
[02:50:13.180 --> 02:50:13.579]  I love it.
[02:50:13.639 --> 02:50:14.139]  This is great.
[02:50:14.440 --> 02:50:16.639]  But I need funds to fight a war.
[02:50:17.319 --> 02:50:18.120]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:19.719]  DrJonesNatinals.com.
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:21.879]  Those are the coordinates of the resistance.
[02:50:22.319 --> 02:50:30.120]  It's all there and it's great products at great prices, highest quality, and it funds the fight against the new world order that's coming out on us with both damn feet.
[02:50:30.260 --> 02:50:32.020]  But at least we're in the fight and we're starting to win.
[02:50:32.479 --> 02:50:34.440]  And in the information war...
[02:50:34.899 --> 02:50:44.659]  There's no gun out there, no howitzer, no missile launcher, no nuclear arsenal more powerful than what we've done.
[02:50:44.659 --> 02:50:50.420]  We wrote the blueprint of victory with God's help, with this audience and guests and activists and crew.
[02:50:51.950 --> 02:50:56.290]  And we are seeing devastating defeats of the New World Order, not just here, but around the world.
[02:50:56.729 --> 02:51:05.110]  Now, 350-plus radio stations don't carry this first five minutes, but I know a lot of folks are watching online and on TV and places like Cloud TV where we're number one.
[02:51:06.110 --> 02:51:10.530]  So Owen Schroyer over in the other studio does a fabulous job on the current ongoing races.
[02:51:11.129 --> 02:51:12.389]  Will we get the trifecta?
[02:51:12.430 --> 02:51:13.430]  Will we lose the house?
[02:51:13.909 --> 02:51:20.030]  They're really trying to steal it right now, but big news coming out around the country where the glitches are being discovered, the fraud and flipping...
[02:51:21.370 --> 02:51:22.690]  To Republican wins.
[02:51:22.889 --> 02:51:26.850]  Give us a prelude of what's coming up, Owen, when we join stations after this quick break.
[02:51:28.280 --> 02:51:28.719]  Sure.
[02:51:28.959 --> 02:51:36.360]  I would say to get what people really want to know out of the way here, yes, I still believe Republicans will maintain the House.
[02:51:36.620 --> 02:51:40.520]  I think your worst case scenario right now is 220 seats.
[02:51:40.659 --> 02:51:42.219]  That would be a two-seat advantage.
[02:51:42.319 --> 02:51:46.700]  I think a likely scenario is going to be 222 seats.
[02:51:46.760 --> 02:51:49.100]  That would be a four-seat advantage.
[02:51:49.100 --> 02:51:54.620]  And I think your best case scenario would be a six-seat advantage at 224 seats.
[02:51:54.760 --> 02:51:56.879]  I think that that's kind of your range right now.
[02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:58.100]  You're looking at six.
[02:51:58.370 --> 02:52:01.709]  To two, advantage for Republicans in the House.
[02:52:01.729 --> 02:52:15.409]  When we come back from this break, in this short segment, we'll look at all these different races and where things are going, and then we'll look at some of the anomalies that you were talking about earlier with your Rasmussen polling guest, Mark Mitchell, because yes, there are things that don't add up.
[02:52:15.510 --> 02:52:21.030]  And even though Democrats did vote for Trump, there is something else to be discussed with that.
[02:52:21.069 --> 02:52:21.829]  So we'll discuss that.
[02:52:21.889 --> 02:52:27.450]  Now, in the Senate side, it's confirmed Republicans will have 53 seats in the Senate.
[02:52:27.590 --> 02:52:29.149]  That's a three-seat advantage.
[02:52:29.790 --> 02:52:32.690]  And they are not done counting in Arizona.
[02:52:32.889 --> 02:52:35.149]  And, of course, that's Carrie Lake and Reuben Gallego.
[02:52:35.329 --> 02:52:36.690]  You know, that's a bit of a mystery.
[02:52:36.909 --> 02:52:37.750]  Again, I know that...
[02:52:38.350 --> 02:52:50.049]  Democrats were voting for Trump in this election, and so that might explain why some of these Democrats were able to get in, more specifically in Senate races, as Republicans did well in the Arizona House.
[02:52:50.149 --> 02:52:58.809]  It's harder to steal House seats than it is Senate seats, because most of the fraud goes on in the big cities like Phoenix or Maricopa County, Arizona.
[02:52:58.809 --> 02:53:00.190]  So they're still counting those.
[02:53:00.350 --> 02:53:07.520]  That race has not yet been called, and I believe they have until the end of the day today Actually, to cure the ballots.
[02:53:07.680 --> 02:53:11.020]  And so what the Cary Lake campaign is doing right now is they're on the phone.
[02:53:11.200 --> 02:53:14.739]  All the ballots that got rejected that were for Cary Lake, they're calling these people.
[02:53:14.920 --> 02:53:16.360]  They're making sure the votes get counted.
[02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:21.239]  And so it's a big deficit, but they're still fighting hard there.
[02:53:21.760 --> 02:53:35.379]  Now, one thing we saw that I think is going to become a topic of conversation as these races close out and they finally call the rest of these House races and Senate races, I do anticipate it will be by the end of the week we'll have these final numbers.
[02:53:36.840 --> 02:53:38.239]  Woo!
[02:53:45.319 --> 02:53:45.600]  Woo!
[02:53:54.379 --> 02:54:00.420]  Tammy Baldwin goes straight up and then leads the rest of the way and eventually maintains that Senate seat.
[02:54:00.600 --> 02:54:08.819]  So it's not an impossibility, considering Trump got a lot of Democrat votes, that these incumbents could maintain their Senate seat.
[02:54:08.819 --> 02:54:09.920]  It's really not that far-fetched.
[02:54:09.959 --> 02:54:19.620]  But what is far-fetched is having an entire ballot drop and 100% or 90-100% go to a single candidate.
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:21.459]  That is an anomaly.
[02:54:21.459 --> 02:54:25.780]  That is a statistical improbability, if not impossibility.
[02:54:26.040 --> 02:54:29.860]  An incumbent maintaining its seat as a Democrat when Democrats are voting for Trump?
[02:54:30.020 --> 02:54:31.040]  Okay, that's possible.
[02:54:31.159 --> 02:54:31.700]  That's plausible.
[02:54:31.700 --> 02:54:32.520]  I can believe that.
[02:54:32.659 --> 02:54:40.200]  But these ballot drops, specifically like Tammy Baldwin got in Michigan, where it just goes straight up Same thing we saw in 2020.
[02:54:40.639 --> 02:54:51.000]  These are the things that are going to need to be investigated, and I'm suspicious that you'll see that in Michigan and in Wisconsin, but we already have that in Michigan, and we'll get more into these house races on the other side.
[02:54:52.020 --> 02:54:53.139]  Man, Owen's good.
[02:54:53.719 --> 02:54:54.120]  Ha ha!
[02:54:54.500 --> 02:54:56.299]  Hope they don't shut down Infowars on Wednesday.
[02:54:56.360 --> 02:54:57.280]  I want to keep doing this.
[02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:00.020]  But regardless, we keep fighting on.
[02:55:00.180 --> 02:55:00.579]  Stay with us.
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:04.879]  Major breaking election news here on air.
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:11.360]  In the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show in the embattled Infowar Studios in Austin, Texas.
[02:55:12.100 --> 02:55:15.579]  Wednesday, coming up in 48 hours, we will be up for sale.
[02:55:15.819 --> 02:55:22.079]  The bad guys said they're going to buy it and shut us down, but we'll continue on thanks to your support with the Alex Jones Network if that happens.
[02:55:22.399 --> 02:55:23.620]  But there is the video.
[02:55:23.799 --> 02:55:26.459]  There's the report from last hour, now out to the world.
[02:55:28.540 --> 02:55:33.159]  Archived at X, election bombshell, Democrats tried to steal 2024 election and failed.
[02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:39.680]  Trump must launch an election integrity commission, says the head of Rasmussen polling.
[02:55:40.020 --> 02:55:43.600]  And that's what Owen was just laying out as well.
[02:55:43.780 --> 02:55:45.340]  But the proof is overwhelming.
[02:55:45.479 --> 02:55:48.719]  They've been caught everywhere with these glitches, stealing seats from Republicans.
[02:55:48.719 --> 02:55:57.600]  But now it's backfired in Michigan and other areas where congressional seats and others are being flipped back to Republican because they've caught them red-handed.
[02:55:57.600 --> 02:55:59.739]  That report just went up at Real Alex Jones.
[02:55:59.959 --> 02:56:00.299]  Get it?
[02:56:03.159 --> 02:56:07.940]  We're good to go.
[02:56:18.260 --> 02:56:19.200]  In two years.
[02:56:19.420 --> 02:56:21.360]  But we've also got to get Trump into office.
[02:56:21.979 --> 02:56:23.479]  69 days left.
[02:56:23.719 --> 02:56:29.440]  They're trying to put Harris in as the president to legitimize some type of coup operation.
[02:56:29.639 --> 02:56:30.979]  Trump has never been in more danger.
[02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:31.760]  Pray for him.
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.459]  I think he should up his security, obviously, even more.
[02:56:35.219 --> 02:56:39.479]  Owen Schroer is in the studio here in the war room.
[02:56:40.260 --> 02:56:56.180]  As we call it, where he hosts the War Room, coming up in just 52 minutes from now, but to lay out the big picture and then drill into the current races, because the election's still not decided, they could potentially still steal the House, even if we get a few members,
[02:56:56.379 --> 02:57:00.680]  a small majority, then the Deep State controls the Justice Department for now.
[02:57:00.799 --> 02:57:05.620]  They will indict a bunch of Republicans like they've already been doing the last eight years to lower that number.
[02:57:06.079 --> 02:57:07.479]  This is serious.
[02:57:07.899 --> 02:57:09.879]  They also threaten people until they resign.
[02:57:10.159 --> 02:57:16.540]  We saw the House majority in the last two years decimated down to almost nothing with this.
[02:57:16.700 --> 02:57:20.020]  So we know their tactics, but the good news is people are awake now.
[02:57:20.260 --> 02:57:23.760]  So, Owen Schroyer, historic moment now.
[02:57:23.979 --> 02:57:25.680]  Almost a week out from this election.
[02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:26.360]  Give us the latest.
[02:57:27.530 --> 02:57:35.190]  So I think it's a pretty safe bet that the Republicans are going to maintain the House majority by as little as two seats.
[02:57:35.409 --> 02:57:38.370]  I think 220 is probably your low number there.
[02:57:40.129 --> 02:57:44.610]  222 is a possibility, maybe even an odds-on favorite.
[02:57:44.870 --> 02:57:50.690]  And then 224 would be your highest potential number of seats for the Republicans in the House.
[02:57:50.809 --> 02:57:53.510]  And we'll drill down into some of these races that are still ongoing.
[02:57:54.079 --> 02:57:56.700]  But also 53 seats in the Senate.
[02:57:56.879 --> 02:58:01.920]  The Republicans have gotten 53 seats with Arizona still counting votes.
[02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:05.520]  Carrie Lake has a large deficit right now that she needs to overcome.
[02:58:05.700 --> 02:58:09.700]  They're still curing ballots they have until the end of the day to do that.
[02:58:09.899 --> 02:58:13.760]  But we will likely know the Senate results probably within 24 hours.
[02:58:13.790 --> 02:58:17.209]  And I would definitely say the House results by the end of the week.
[02:58:17.350 --> 02:58:19.870]  But let's actually zoom in and look what we still have.
[02:58:19.950 --> 02:58:21.969]  Now, Maine is an interesting case here.
[02:58:22.170 --> 02:58:38.209]  The Republican candidate has actually closed the gap, but with 99% reporting, I'm not sure if 2,000 votes remain for Therault to overcome Golden in Maine, but they have not declared this race yet.
[02:58:38.459 --> 02:58:43.940]  And so that's ongoing, but I'm not really counting on that to be another Republican one seat.
[02:58:44.079 --> 02:58:48.180]  Now, most of the other races in the East and the Midwest have already been decided.
[02:58:48.579 --> 02:58:53.340]  If you go over here to Northern Ohio, this is one a lot of people are talking about.
[02:58:54.829 --> 02:59:04.170]  And what you'll see here is that cop tour is beating Marin by just over a thousand votes with ninety four percent in.
[02:59:04.329 --> 02:59:07.450]  And so this is still a tight race can go either way.
[02:59:07.590 --> 02:59:20.090]  Now, when I crunch the numbers from the presidential election and I look at this, I don't think that Marin can overcome this deficit because there are too many Democrat votes in Toledo right here.
[02:59:20.549 --> 02:59:29.149]  And so even though Trump had 20,000 more votes in this Northwest region, in Toledo, Harris had 30,000 more votes.
[02:59:29.309 --> 02:59:35.190]  So that's also not a race that I'm counting on Republicans winning, but it is It is possible.
[02:59:35.350 --> 02:59:39.770]  That is a small margin there with just over 1,094% in.
[02:59:39.909 --> 02:59:41.690]  And then we go over here to Iowa.
[02:59:42.450 --> 02:59:49.510]  This one, I think it's safe to say that the Republican will win, even though it is a small, a very small margin right here.
[02:59:49.590 --> 02:59:51.110]  We're talking less than 1,000%.
[02:59:51.139 --> 02:59:57.399]  We're good to go.
[02:59:57.879 --> 03:00:12.100]  We're good to go.
[03:00:17.670 --> 03:00:21.870]  Yes, right here, this one I'd say is pretty safe, only 80% in.
[03:00:22.030 --> 03:00:25.629]  It is a small margin, just 2,000.
[03:00:25.790 --> 03:00:38.930]  But based off of the voting trends from the presidential election and the Senate, even though only 80% in with a 2,000-vote advantage, this one I'm favoring that the Republicans will be able to maintain that seat.
[03:00:39.049 --> 03:00:42.610]  And then there's one more here, guys, if we want to look at the other race that's still open.
[03:00:43.090 --> 03:00:44.190]  Yes, there it is.
[03:00:44.549 --> 03:00:53.729]  This one looks a little safer to me, as you can see, a much wider margin here and a bit more of the votes in, 87% in for Schweikert.
[03:00:53.950 --> 03:01:00.750]  This one is a safe Republican hold, I believe, even though they're still counting, okay?
[03:01:00.930 --> 03:01:10.610]  So at this point, I think you're picking up We're good to go.
[03:01:32.129 --> 03:01:34.750]  But right now, I think it looks good for Begich.
[03:01:34.909 --> 03:01:43.889]  But these two Democrats on the ticket, that kind of throws the whole thing into a weird state, with now Begich potentially getting knocked down to third in ranked-choice voting.
[03:01:43.950 --> 03:01:48.049]  But I think that this is probably good for Republicans as well.
[03:01:48.129 --> 03:01:56.370]  So I'd say, considering that, you have probably three that are safe to say, if not four, that the Republicans are gonna get there, as we're still counting.
[03:01:56.450 --> 03:02:01.149]  Now, we're gonna have to zoom in here to California, because a lot of these districts get really small.
[03:02:01.379 --> 03:02:05.440]  Actually, guys, let's actually go to Washington and Oregon, and then we'll zoom in here.
[03:02:05.920 --> 03:02:07.120]  This looks pretty safe.
[03:02:07.280 --> 03:02:10.059]  Obviously, Republicans, it's just a matter of which one is going to win it.
[03:02:10.719 --> 03:02:13.819]  But this Washington District 4, that's going to be positive.
[03:02:14.459 --> 03:02:17.120]  Oregon, it doesn't look so good for the Republicans there.
[03:02:18.539 --> 03:02:20.219]  As you can see, they're still counting votes.
[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:25.260]  That's a large margin to try to make up for with little time, little votes remaining.
[03:02:25.500 --> 03:02:27.159]  So that one looks good for the Democrats.
[03:02:27.379 --> 03:02:37.340]  All right, now we're going to zoom in to California, and this is probably where the House is going to be decided in some of these small little districts.
[03:02:37.459 --> 03:02:41.059]  And let's zoom in as close as we can here, guys, because some of these are really, really small.
[03:02:41.540 --> 03:02:45.059]  So we'll start down here in Southern California.
[03:02:47.040 --> 03:02:48.059]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:02:48.219 --> 03:02:52.299]  This one is probably looking good for Democrats, only 80% in.
[03:02:52.479 --> 03:02:56.559]  But again, that's about over 10,000 vote lead for Levin.
[03:02:56.700 --> 03:02:58.840]  I don't think he's going to give that lead up.
[03:02:58.840 --> 03:03:04.180]  If you go over here more inland, this one looks safe, I believe, for Republicans.
[03:03:04.180 --> 03:03:09.200]  So I think this is a seat that you can count on the Republicans winning here as well.
[03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:15.020]  If we go more into the metropolitan areas, This one is tight.
[03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:21.100]  Bo and Min have actually been flipping throughout this race, but Min has now taken the lead.
[03:03:21.280 --> 03:03:28.600]  This was a race that Bo was actually in the lead for most of the time, but now that has flipped and Min is in the lead.
[03:03:29.180 --> 03:03:35.299]  So that's when I'm not counting for Republicans right now, even though it's tight and they've been flipping back and forth.
[03:03:36.299 --> 03:03:39.079]  Maybe there needs to be some investigating there.
[03:03:39.200 --> 03:03:40.500]  However, Bo was in the lead.
[03:03:40.620 --> 03:03:41.479]  Min has now taken it over.
[03:03:41.559 --> 03:03:42.579]  Now, if you go more into the...
[03:03:43.409 --> 03:03:44.190]  Deeper in here.
[03:03:44.350 --> 03:03:46.329]  Steele has been leading this entire time.
[03:03:47.170 --> 03:03:51.129]  And she's got a pretty safe margin, I would say, there with 80%.
[03:03:51.129 --> 03:03:52.729]  She's got a pretty safe margin.
[03:03:53.049 --> 03:03:56.750]  So I'm counting this for the Republicans as well.
[03:03:56.909 --> 03:03:57.129]  All right.
[03:03:57.290 --> 03:04:02.170]  We're going to zoom up here to some of the bigger areas of California, if we want to even zoom out.
[03:04:02.709 --> 03:04:06.370]  So I think the Democrats are going to hold on to this seat.
[03:04:06.779 --> 03:04:11.079]  And I believe the Democrats are going to hold on to, oh no, I'm sorry, that's a Republican.
[03:04:11.239 --> 03:04:12.299]  Yeah, I think this is pretty safe.
[03:04:12.500 --> 03:04:17.059]  You've got just under 10,000 vote margin here, 71% in.
[03:04:17.299 --> 03:04:18.979]  I don't think the numbers are there.
[03:04:19.600 --> 03:04:22.760]  I don't think the numbers are there for California District 2 to go Democrats.
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:24.700]  So I think the Republicans hold on to that too.
[03:04:24.799 --> 03:04:26.260]  So if we zoom back out here, guys.
[03:04:27.840 --> 03:04:33.520]  So basically, I think there might be one more or two more districts in California for us to look at, actually, guys.
[03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:35.120]  Let's look there and there.
[03:04:38.750 --> 03:04:40.409]  Okay, yeah, that's gonna go for a Democrat.
[03:04:40.770 --> 03:04:42.629]  And then check up north here, guys.
[03:04:42.750 --> 03:04:43.850]  Let's see if there's not another one.
[03:04:46.329 --> 03:04:48.090]  Yeah, so that's going for the Democrats, too.
[03:04:48.229 --> 03:04:50.149]  But there you have it, Alex.
[03:04:50.290 --> 03:04:51.250]  There's your final numbers.
[03:04:51.450 --> 03:04:58.909]  And based off of this, that's why I believe the Republicans will safely get 220, potentially as high as 224.
[03:04:59.170 --> 03:05:05.729]  But I think you're probably looking at a 222 number for Republicans in the House.
[03:05:05.950 --> 03:05:23.159]  Now, if you want to zoom in and look at some anomalies, if we go into New York, the Democrats flipped a seat in New York That has a very strange story to it because Trump actually did well in these districts, but somehow the Democrats were able to flip.
[03:05:23.559 --> 03:05:25.719]  Try to find D'Esposito.
[03:05:25.959 --> 03:05:31.420]  Somehow the Democrats were able to flip this seat with less than 10,000.
[03:05:31.600 --> 03:05:33.680]  They've already called it 94% in.
[03:05:34.110 --> 03:05:47.250]  We're good to go.
[03:05:49.110 --> 03:05:53.370]  If you take it at face value, these are Democrats voting for Donald Trump.
[03:05:53.489 --> 03:05:56.030]  And I think there's no doubt that we saw a lot of that.
[03:05:56.149 --> 03:05:57.430]  Guys, take that off the screen for me.
[03:05:57.510 --> 03:06:02.309]  I believe they flipped another seat right here and right here, the Democrats that is.
[03:06:02.750 --> 03:06:05.510]  So there's one they flipped and then here's another one they flipped.
[03:06:05.870 --> 03:06:11.549]  So the story here is again, Democrats voted for Donald Trump.
[03:06:12.209 --> 03:06:21.610]  And I think that's why you see some of these down-ballot races where the Democrats flipped seats in the House, and that's because Democrats voted for Donald Trump, and then down-ballot, they voted for Democrats.
[03:06:21.610 --> 03:06:26.870]  And these numbers are adding up in House races, and they're adding up in Senate races.
[03:06:38.010 --> 03:06:42.069]  We're good to go.
[03:06:50.079 --> 03:06:51.479]  It's going to be what ultimately determines it.
[03:06:51.719 --> 03:07:08.079]  And if these things flip in the middle of the night, then we're going to have some serious issues, like what people are noticing in Wisconsin, where Tammy Baldwin, 3.30 in the morning, same story we saw from 2020, a ballot drop comes in, all of them for the Democrat Senate candidate,
[03:07:08.319 --> 03:07:11.959]  she flips that seat, and all of a sudden the Democrats are able to maintain it.
[03:07:12.040 --> 03:07:15.600]  And that could have been the difference between 53 and 54.
[03:07:16.100 --> 03:07:18.940]  I haven't seen that coming out of Michigan yet.
[03:07:19.459 --> 03:07:22.899]  We'll see if anybody produces any of that evidence, but it has come out of Wisconsin.
[03:07:23.139 --> 03:07:26.620]  It's been a big story today, and people are saying, how does this happen?
[03:07:26.719 --> 03:07:44.739]  How does this happen where the Republican presidential candidate wins Wisconsin, the Republican Senate candidate is leading for most of the race, and then at 3.30 in the morning, a ballot dump comes in, and it's 90-plus percent for the Democratic candidate, just enough to give her the lead and for them to maintain that seat.
[03:07:44.899 --> 03:07:47.340]  So this is where we're at at the congressional level.
[03:07:47.700 --> 03:07:53.579]  We obviously, for Trump's agenda, need to maintain all three branches of Congress.
[03:07:53.940 --> 03:08:03.120]  And so, right now, the executive is good, and we're looking at the House race gonna be tight, but I still think Republicans maintain it, and the Senate is locked up.
[03:08:03.200 --> 03:08:05.940]  And so now it becomes an issue of Senate leadership at the Senate level.
[03:08:06.539 --> 03:08:10.479]  And you're going to come in and host the last 30 minutes ahead of your show.
[03:08:10.500 --> 03:08:11.459]  You've got a lot more to say.
[03:08:11.579 --> 03:08:12.620]  I'm going to hand the baton to you.
[03:08:12.959 --> 03:08:17.700]  I want to talk big picture here because I respect your view on this.
[03:08:18.379 --> 03:08:21.379]  Obviously, they want Sotomayor to step down so they can put somebody fresh in.
[03:08:21.459 --> 03:08:22.620]  They say she's like a vegetable now.
[03:08:23.379 --> 03:08:28.040]  You've got the gimmick of them trying to put in Harris as the first female president.
[03:08:28.040 --> 03:08:29.479]  But I think that's more than just a gimmick.
[03:08:29.680 --> 03:08:32.700]  That legitimizes it if they can kill Trump or Vance or both.
[03:08:39.590 --> 03:08:57.909]  What do you expect them to do,
[03:08:58.010 --> 03:08:58.170]  Owen?
[03:08:59.420 --> 03:09:01.639]  Yeah, I think all of these plans will flop.
[03:09:01.819 --> 03:09:02.940]  I think they'll all fail.
[03:09:03.280 --> 03:09:05.799]  I don't think, now Sona Meyer is a different story.
[03:09:05.860 --> 03:09:07.860]  I do think that she has health issues.
[03:09:07.860 --> 03:09:14.239]  They're not really being transparent about that, but it seems like she's inevitably going to be out in the next four years.
[03:09:14.540 --> 03:09:28.399]  They might just force her to cling to that spot like they did with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and of course we all know how that turned out, but it would seem, based off the reports, that she has some serious health issues and she's inevitably going to be off the bench soon.
[03:09:28.500 --> 03:09:31.680]  I don't I don't think Biden is going to make a move for this Democrat Party.
[03:09:31.860 --> 03:09:35.219]  I don't think Biden is going to make a move for Kamala Harris.
[03:09:35.479 --> 03:09:40.020]  I think that Biden feels betrayed by the Democrats after what they did to him.
[03:09:40.180 --> 03:09:49.000]  And quite frankly, I think that Joe Biden and Donald Trump are making deals behind the scenes right now, and they could be considering swapping pardons.
[03:09:49.180 --> 03:09:54.399]  Trump pardoning the Biden crime family and Biden, of course, pardoning Donald Trump before he gets into office.
[03:10:02.579 --> 03:10:19.459]  I think that's going to have major backlash.
[03:10:19.700 --> 03:10:20.879]  And I think that they know that.
[03:10:20.979 --> 03:10:22.180]  I think that they're reading the room.
[03:10:22.340 --> 03:10:24.280]  I think at the party level, they're deflated.
[03:10:24.420 --> 03:10:27.819]  Now, the deep state level is an entirely different ballgame altogether.
[03:10:28.579 --> 03:10:36.180]  The entrenched bureaucracies that have been against Donald Trump and, of course, are working with foreign intelligence agencies, not to mention an open border.
[03:10:36.420 --> 03:10:40.120]  You know, that's kind of, I think, where the real threat comes from here.
[03:10:40.239 --> 03:10:46.020]  But as far as the Democrat Party and their operatives inside the party and at the grassroots level, they're deflated.
[03:10:46.020 --> 03:10:47.799]  They have nothing left in the tank, Alex.
[03:10:48.100 --> 03:10:52.680]  I think all their plans to derail Trump getting into office will flop and fail royally.
[03:10:52.899 --> 03:11:03.200]  I overall agree with that, but back to the special teams type situation that Fletcher Prouty exposed, back with the Kennedy assassination, the Pentagon reports to the globalists at the top.
[03:11:03.200 --> 03:11:05.459]  It's one of the most infiltrated, if not the most infiltrated areas.
[03:11:06.040 --> 03:11:10.180]  CNN even reports their meeting in secret on how to stop Trump doing illegal things.
[03:11:10.690 --> 03:11:12.950]  Well, that's a way to say we're going to have a coup because he's bad.
[03:11:13.149 --> 03:11:13.870]  He's Hitler.
[03:11:14.809 --> 03:11:23.229]  This is a big deal, and I'm really concerned about more assassination attempts, not wind-up toys like we saw the last two times, but some serious professionals.
[03:11:23.709 --> 03:11:30.629]  I don't even know yet if Trump's gotten anti-missile defense with C-130s following him with the flares.
[03:11:30.829 --> 03:11:33.049]  I'm really concerned about the surface-to-air missile and more.
[03:11:33.190 --> 03:11:34.290]  What's your view on that?
[03:11:55.979 --> 03:11:56.639]  I think?
[03:11:56.860 --> 03:11:58.120]  That needs to be the strategy.
[03:11:58.280 --> 03:11:59.600]  Just hunker down at Mar-a-Lago.
[03:11:59.840 --> 03:12:05.299]  If anybody wants an interview or if the press wants to do a press conference, they can go down to Florida and deal with it there.
[03:12:05.479 --> 03:12:12.120]  I hope that's Trump's strategy because, yeah, getting up in the air or leaving would be a serious concern.
[03:12:12.399 --> 03:12:16.239]  And I think we all still have trust issues with secret service.
[03:12:16.559 --> 03:12:22.790]  And until Trump becomes president of the United States and can take over that, And maybe even put people in there that he trusts.
[03:12:23.489 --> 03:12:25.250]  Yeah, I'd say stay grounded.
[03:12:25.729 --> 03:12:28.389]  Stay in Mar-a-Lago until the inauguration.
[03:12:28.930 --> 03:12:29.969]  Just hunker down.
[03:12:30.229 --> 03:12:35.989]  And I would say if any media wants comments or press conferences, they've got to come down to Mar-a-Lago to do that.
[03:12:36.629 --> 03:12:41.049]  Oh, and you're going to take over and cover a lot of other news that is front and center for you.
[03:12:41.209 --> 03:12:45.069]  And then you're going to do three hours for your own show, the War Room.
[03:12:46.229 --> 03:12:54.979]  What do you make of all over the country Particularly Michigan, glitches being just against Republicans flipping House seats, local legislative seats.
[03:12:55.139 --> 03:12:56.159]  I covered this earlier.
[03:12:56.780 --> 03:13:01.479]  Four counties in Michigan find 26,000, over 26,000 votes days after the election.
[03:13:01.639 --> 03:13:05.459]  Several seats flipped from Democrat and Republican, including one Republican.
[03:13:06.010 --> 03:13:06.989]  Michigan House seat.
[03:13:07.110 --> 03:13:08.250]  This is a big deal.
[03:13:08.450 --> 03:13:13.170]  Trump's got to have an election integrity commission, as the head of Rasmussen Polling sang.
[03:13:13.329 --> 03:13:16.329]  He went so far as to say Democrats tried to steal it and failed.
[03:13:16.629 --> 03:13:28.569]  We saw that at 10.30 at night, very close, when they froze the voting in the battleground states, where obviously the steal was on, but there were so many lawyers there watching it, they couldn't do it.
[03:13:28.649 --> 03:13:33.329]  I mean, this is amazing, but we've got to get ready for the fight even two years from now.
[03:13:33.569 --> 03:13:35.030]  Trump's got to go after that.
[03:13:36.040 --> 03:13:53.260]  Well, I hope that Laura Trump and Michael Watley, who have obviously done a much better job as the RNC leadership than Ronna Romney McDaniel did, I hope that they're maintaining their watchful eye on these House races and the tabulations as they continue to go on.
[03:13:53.340 --> 03:13:55.180]  I think that that's what we desperately need.
[03:13:55.340 --> 03:14:06.739]  You know, as far as the MAGA movement, as far as the Trump voters are concerned, we've kind of shifted our energy into throwing our weight around Who we can get in the administration, who we can keep out of the administration.
[03:14:07.139 --> 03:14:12.979]  Maybe we can have some impact as far as who becomes the Senate Majority Leader and the Speaker of the House.
[03:14:13.319 --> 03:14:18.200]  But that seems to be where the thrust of the MAGA energy, the populist movement is right now.
[03:14:18.319 --> 03:14:19.340]  And it's been a success.
[03:14:19.829 --> 03:14:22.709]  Mike Pompeo will not be a part of the next administration.
[03:14:23.190 --> 03:14:26.250]  Nikki Haley will not get a role in the next administration.
[03:14:26.409 --> 03:14:30.090]  And we've already had good people coming in like RFK Jr.
[03:14:30.350 --> 03:14:31.309]  with Health and Human Services.
[03:14:31.549 --> 03:14:36.450]  And Stephen Miller will be the Chief of Staff when it comes to foreign policy.
[03:14:36.809 --> 03:14:40.649]  So now we're kind of looking at the administration, throwing our weight around there.
[03:14:40.790 --> 03:14:49.110]  We certainly don't want John Thune or John Cornyn to be the Senate majority leadership, though it looks like the swamp and the Republicans are trying to force them through.
[03:14:49.370 --> 03:14:57.969]  The MAGA movement is behind Rick Scott or just anybody except Cornyn or Thune, but it looks like it's going to come down to Thune or Rick Scott.
[03:14:58.110 --> 03:15:01.129]  And so we'll see what kind of weight the populist MAGA movement can throw behind that.
[03:15:01.979 --> 03:15:09.520]  Mike Johnson has said that he wants to become Speaker of the House again, but there are some grumblings inside the Republican Party.
[03:15:10.020 --> 03:15:11.479]  There are some grumblings from the Freedom Caucus.
[03:15:11.479 --> 03:15:12.399]  Oh, and we've got to go to break.
[03:15:12.579 --> 03:15:16.100]  You're going to come in and cover all this and do a great job in the build-up to your show.
[03:15:16.420 --> 03:15:17.559]  Real fast, 30 seconds.
[03:15:17.959 --> 03:15:19.120]  We can be shut down Wednesday.
[03:15:19.299 --> 03:15:20.600]  You've done an incredible job here.
[03:15:20.780 --> 03:15:21.479]  What is it like?
[03:15:21.620 --> 03:15:23.159]  I mean, it's the last chance for people.
[03:15:23.159 --> 03:15:24.940]  In case we get shut down, very good chance.
[03:15:25.139 --> 03:15:28.680]  And the funds that come in anyways, we'll just roll into InfoWars if we don't get shut down.
[03:15:28.739 --> 03:15:30.680]  But we need support now at theologianstore.com.
[03:15:30.899 --> 03:15:31.819]  Get the Trump gear.
[03:15:31.959 --> 03:15:32.819]  Get the great supplements.
[03:15:33.100 --> 03:15:35.020]  We need the support now, Owen.
[03:15:35.159 --> 03:15:36.459]  I mean, this is so important.
[03:15:36.760 --> 03:15:41.700]  What's your message to folks out there about this critical time and keeping us on the air, even if InfoWars shuts down?
[03:15:43.229 --> 03:15:45.030]  Well, it's just been an incredible ride here.
[03:15:45.190 --> 03:15:48.309]  This has been the Millennium Falcon in the Info War.
[03:15:48.510 --> 03:15:51.250]  This has been the Millennium Falcon to take America back.
[03:15:51.790 --> 03:16:02.889]  And, you know, I'm not the biggest Star Wars buff or nerd, but I think I remember some scene where the Millennium Falcon is about to go up against the Empire, and it's like the only ship in the sky.
[03:16:02.889 --> 03:16:04.229]  And they're like, where is everybody?
[03:16:04.350 --> 03:16:04.950]  Where is everybody?
[03:16:05.170 --> 03:16:06.889]  Well, now everybody's with us, Alex.
[03:16:07.030 --> 03:16:12.180]  You know, I feel like we here on the Millennium Falcon, we've taken a lot of We've taken a lot of dings.
[03:16:12.420 --> 03:16:13.799]  We've taken a lot of hits.
[03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:16.260]  We've been trying to be knocked out of orbit multiple times.
[03:16:16.260 --> 03:16:17.799]  They're still trying to drag us down.
[03:16:18.379 --> 03:16:20.520]  But now the reinforcements are arriving.
[03:16:20.540 --> 03:16:25.340]  Now there's a whole sky full of freedom fighters like us.
[03:16:26.680 --> 03:16:29.100]  I don't know what the fate of Infowars will be.
[03:16:29.200 --> 03:16:30.000]  It's in God's hands.
[03:16:30.100 --> 03:16:31.180]  It's in the audience's hands.
[03:16:31.360 --> 03:16:42.020]  But this ship, this mothership of information and independent news with our guests and our audience has made devastating blows to the New World Order, devastating blows to the deep swamp.
[03:16:42.360 --> 03:16:45.819]  And I feel like our victory is now moving forward.
[03:16:47.090 --> 03:16:47.489]  Absolutely.
[03:16:47.809 --> 03:16:50.389]  Now is the time for action because the sky is full of patriots.
[03:16:50.530 --> 03:16:52.489]  We're turning the tide, but remember the OGs.
[03:16:52.770 --> 03:16:53.889]  We need your support.
[03:16:54.049 --> 03:16:55.290]  Great t-shirts, great supplements.

[03:17:21.690 --> 03:17:22.829]  InfoWars is so important.

[03:18:29.290 --> 03:18:41.010]  Well, you know, when I first started at Infowars in 2016, I was hosting the fourth hour.
[03:18:42.420 --> 03:18:46.840]  And then we started the War Room, and well, the rest is history, as they say.
[03:18:47.420 --> 03:18:53.399]  But good to be back here on the Alex Jones Show, hosting the fourth hour.
[03:18:53.559 --> 03:19:00.760]  Now, we got into what remains of the 2024 election in the House and in the Senate.
[03:19:02.020 --> 03:19:09.860]  And again, the hopes are that the RNC are maintaining their watchful eye on these House races that will ultimately determine...
[03:19:10.860 --> 03:19:12.799]  The balance of power.
[03:19:13.520 --> 03:19:26.959]  Because I guarantee you, should the Democrats get the House, which I'm not predicting they will, I think it's safe plus two for the Republicans, but let's just say the disastrous situation in which the Democrats flipped the House.
[03:19:27.200 --> 03:19:36.379]  Do you really think Hakeem Jeffries is going to be as soft-handed as Mike Johnson was as Speaker?
[03:19:36.620 --> 03:19:36.840]  No.
[03:19:37.840 --> 03:19:47.600]  No, if the Democrats get in charge of the House and they get the Speaker of the House, they're going to block the Trump agenda with everything they possibly can.
[03:19:49.520 --> 03:19:56.340]  It's not going to be like these weak-kneed conservatives like Mike Johnson that give the Democrats everything they want and fold on the big issues.
[03:19:56.659 --> 03:19:57.780]  No, the Democrats...
[03:19:58.979 --> 03:20:22.270]  We'll do everything they can in their power to stop the Trump agenda should they get the house and so that's why it's so important that we maintain our eyes on these remaining ballots that are still being counted and we need to make sure that the Republicans win this house and it'll be a different picture It'll be a different picture with this administration than the last administration for two reasons.
[03:20:22.549 --> 03:20:28.610]  One, Trump's picks for his administration are going to be much better than they were in 2016.
[03:20:28.770 --> 03:20:34.850]  There aren't going to be, and I won't say any, but there won't be as many, because I'm sure some will find their way in.
[03:20:35.010 --> 03:20:36.850]  But there won't be as many traitors.
[03:20:37.010 --> 03:20:39.469]  There won't be as many that are against the MAGA movement.
[03:20:39.629 --> 03:20:45.530]  There won't be as many swamp Republicans or swamp bureaucrats that get into this administration in 2024.
[03:20:45.670 --> 03:20:46.950]  So you've got that going.
[03:20:47.649 --> 03:20:55.290]  And then I also think at the House level, many Republicans in 2016 kind of bought into the Trump-Russia collusion nonsense.
[03:20:55.290 --> 03:20:56.709]  They believed it.
[03:20:59.129 --> 03:21:00.250]  And then also...
[03:21:01.889 --> 03:21:05.209]  They were just kind of scared to associate themselves with Trump.
[03:21:05.370 --> 03:21:08.190]  They were still kind of afraid to politically support Trump.
[03:21:08.370 --> 03:21:11.950]  They thought that that might hurt their own political career.
[03:21:12.309 --> 03:21:18.430]  And there's been all kinds of appointments and administration decisions that have actually been happening in the last 48, 24 hours.
[03:21:18.510 --> 03:21:20.049]  It looks like another one has just been made.
[03:21:20.209 --> 03:21:21.610]  The crew just put that on the screen.
[03:21:22.229 --> 03:21:25.590]  If you guys want to print that to me, I'll report that.
[03:21:25.729 --> 03:21:29.389]  But it looks like, was that Lee Zeldin I saw just got appointed to some role?
[03:21:30.020 --> 03:21:31.139]  Of course, RFK Jr.
[03:21:31.399 --> 03:21:31.780]  is in.
[03:21:32.399 --> 03:21:39.159]  I don't think the Elon Musk Department of Government Efficiency has been officially announced yet.
[03:21:39.159 --> 03:21:42.280]  I believe that's still an unofficial announcement.
[03:21:43.000 --> 03:21:45.620]  But that will be an eventuality.
[03:21:46.079 --> 03:21:49.940]  So here it is, the latest statement from President Trump.
[03:21:50.459 --> 03:22:03.889]  Pleased to announce that the highly respected former congressman from New York, Lee Zeldin, We'll be appointed to serve as the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
[03:22:04.209 --> 03:22:06.110]  Lee, with a very strong legal background.
[03:22:07.030 --> 03:22:09.270]  Has been a true fighter for America First policies.
[03:22:09.489 --> 03:22:24.649]  He will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on the planet.
[03:22:24.809 --> 03:22:33.770]  He will set new standards on environmental review and maintenance that will allow the United States to grow in a healthy and well-structured way.
[03:22:35.030 --> 03:22:36.450]  Alright, Lee Zeldin.
[03:22:37.090 --> 03:22:37.809]  That's good.
[03:22:37.989 --> 03:22:42.450]  It's not going to set anybody on fire, but it's a solid pick.
[03:22:42.450 --> 03:22:47.790]  He's a good guy, and I think he will help the Trump agenda.
[03:22:48.950 --> 03:22:49.510]  So...
[03:22:49.510 --> 03:22:55.110]  Is this a new CNN clip too, guys, bitching about Elon Musk?
[03:22:55.149 --> 03:22:55.930]  Is that what I have here?
[03:22:58.209 --> 03:22:59.729]  Okay, so that's good.
[03:22:59.930 --> 03:23:02.969]  I maintain that that will probably become official...
[03:23:07.819 --> 03:23:12.100]  But right now, keeping John Thune, I think Cornyn's out.
[03:23:12.239 --> 03:23:13.760]  I think Cornyn's waved the white flag.
[03:23:13.940 --> 03:23:17.780]  And I think whoever was supporting Cornyn, Cornyn is now telling to get behind John Thune.
[03:23:19.100 --> 03:23:25.559]  See, now the test in the Senate is, you're going to find it out.
[03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:30.100]  This is a totally different ballgame than it was in 2016.
[03:23:31.879 --> 03:23:33.420]  Now these Republicans...
[03:23:35.030 --> 03:23:45.270]  Whether they're neocons, whether they're rhinos, whether they're just straight politicians, they now have to make the conscious decision.
[03:23:45.649 --> 03:23:53.370]  And they're sitting there in their own political skin and they're thinking, what is going to help me?
[03:23:54.649 --> 03:24:00.850]  Supporting Donald Trump or supporting the Senate Republican establishment?
[03:24:01.090 --> 03:24:02.309]  In other words...
[03:24:04.229 --> 03:24:10.370]  Voting for John Thune, who's been outspoken against Trump in many such occasions.
[03:24:12.229 --> 03:24:13.790]  And I've got multiple videos.
[03:24:13.790 --> 03:24:17.809]  We're going to be covering that on The War Room, why John Thune should be nowhere near Senate leadership.
[03:24:19.350 --> 03:24:26.229]  Or, do I rally behind Rick Scott, which is what the populist MAGA base wants?
[03:24:28.069 --> 03:24:29.670]  So there's going to be a couple messages here.
[03:24:29.829 --> 03:24:45.790]  One, are Republican senators going to look at this and say, it now benefits me more to support Trump and not the swamp Republican Party or what remains of it, the old guard Republicans, the old guard Republican body politic,
[03:24:46.049 --> 03:24:47.649]  which is no longer in fashion.
[03:24:48.389 --> 03:24:49.489]  They're clinging it.
[03:24:49.610 --> 03:24:50.629]  They're clinging onto it.
[03:24:50.850 --> 03:24:51.389]  Or...
[03:24:53.280 --> 03:24:58.540]  Do they respect the fact that this populist movement is what gave the Republicans the House?
[03:24:58.879 --> 03:25:01.200]  And they say, well, we've got to give something back.
[03:25:01.200 --> 03:25:06.459]  We have to at least give them Senate leadership that they will support.
[03:25:07.340 --> 03:25:09.360]  And so that is not John Thune.
[03:25:10.479 --> 03:25:15.659]  Now, there were reports that came out last week saying Trump was bad-mouthing Rick Scott behind his back.
[03:25:16.799 --> 03:25:21.799]  Could have just been BS. Could have been taken out of context as well.
[03:25:23.409 --> 03:25:33.350]  But maybe that was the media or the swap Republicans' efforts or maybe the Thune associate efforts to separate Scott from Trump.
[03:25:34.510 --> 03:25:35.829]  It didn't work.
[03:25:36.610 --> 03:25:37.790]  It didn't work.
[03:25:37.930 --> 03:25:44.610]  And I do believe Trump has actually made a public statement recently endorsing Rick Scott.
[03:25:48.079 --> 03:25:56.899]  So Thune's been an anti-Trumper, multiple occasions, multiple statements, multiple interviews, but he believed he had the votes.
[03:25:57.340 --> 03:25:58.600]  It goes down tomorrow.
[03:25:59.479 --> 03:26:05.260]  And he believed he had the votes, and he believed he would get in there, probably as a Mitch McConnell 2.0.
[03:26:05.379 --> 03:26:07.079]  It's basically Mitch McConnell, except with a pulse.
[03:26:08.520 --> 03:26:10.659]  It's Mitch McConnell, who's not dead on his feet.
[03:26:10.760 --> 03:26:11.540]  That's John Thune.
[03:26:12.680 --> 03:26:16.379]  Or Rick Scott, who will actually have a good relationship with Trump.
[03:26:17.190 --> 03:26:26.690]  And respond to Trump and just won't be a total hack, a total nothing at the Senate leadership level.
[03:26:26.850 --> 03:26:28.829]  But see, the whole approach here is wrong.
[03:26:29.309 --> 03:26:33.129]  Even if it is Rick Scott, that's a grade C, I would say.
[03:26:34.250 --> 03:26:38.989]  Thune is an F, but Scott would be a C. You have to ask this question.
[03:26:39.409 --> 03:26:40.729]  Forget about even Trump.
[03:26:42.059 --> 03:26:43.159]  You have to ask yourself this.
[03:26:43.780 --> 03:26:47.319]  Who would strike fear into the heart of Chuck Schumer?
[03:26:48.879 --> 03:26:56.899]  Who can get on the same level as Chuck Schumer and make him whimper like the little rat that he is?
[03:27:00.100 --> 03:27:04.020]  I don't really see any of the potentials that were being talked about.
[03:27:05.659 --> 03:27:08.819]  But Rand Paul has come out and endorsed Rick Scott.
[03:27:10.629 --> 03:27:18.370]  But I'd rather see somebody who gets up there that is a force to be reckoned with that makes Chuck Schumer whimper.
[03:27:18.409 --> 03:27:20.770]  Like the little rat that he is.
[03:27:21.870 --> 03:27:31.629]  And I don't really see Scott as that role, but it looks like that's going to be our best bet to have somebody who's with Trump and with the MAGA movement as Senate leadership.
[03:27:32.569 --> 03:27:34.950]  As long as it's not John Thune.
[03:27:35.090 --> 03:27:38.209]  Now, Musk put out a poll on this last night.
[03:27:40.750 --> 03:27:41.950]  I had to have millions of votes.
[03:27:42.069 --> 03:27:44.190]  I don't know what the final number was, but I'm sure it was millions.
[03:27:44.909 --> 03:27:49.530]  And 66%, it was Thune, Cornyn, Scott, and other.
[03:27:49.790 --> 03:27:51.270]  66% said Scott.
[03:27:51.450 --> 03:27:52.709]  I think 10% said other.
[03:27:52.889 --> 03:27:58.389]  And then it was like 4% and 3% were with Thune and with Cornyn.
[03:27:58.510 --> 03:28:00.229]  So that's, I mean, that tells you something.
[03:28:01.639 --> 03:28:05.600]  You can put whatever value you want in that, but that is a real representation.
[03:28:05.920 --> 03:28:06.920]  Oh, I'm sorry, my numbers were off.
[03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:16.420]  So 66% for Scott, 23% for Other, and then 7% for Thune, 5% for Cornyn.
[03:28:16.520 --> 03:28:20.559]  So people would rather have Other than Thune or Cornyn.
[03:28:20.639 --> 03:28:21.860]  I mean, that's all you need to see there.
[03:28:23.299 --> 03:28:28.040]  And I think if you had some other names on that list, like a Rand Paul or a Mike Lee...
[03:28:29.779 --> 03:28:33.879]  Or a Kennedy, Louisiana.
[03:28:34.020 --> 03:28:39.079]  I think that you'd probably have more people going for those guys, even for Scott.
[03:28:39.340 --> 03:28:42.659]  But nonetheless, it looks like Scott's going to be your best hope to have somebody that supports Trump.
[03:28:43.399 --> 03:28:44.899]  So we'll follow up on that.
[03:28:45.020 --> 03:28:46.500]  But okay, they don't want...
[03:28:46.500 --> 03:28:48.280]  I mean, these people just love government, you know?
[03:28:49.420 --> 03:28:51.120]  Have you noticed how much they love government?
[03:28:51.520 --> 03:28:53.379]  And so now here comes Elon Musk.
[03:28:54.180 --> 03:28:57.139]  And he's talking about shrinking the government and making it efficient.
[03:28:57.139 --> 03:28:58.440]  And they are just...
[03:28:59.440 --> 03:29:01.200]  They are beside themselves.
[03:29:01.920 --> 03:29:10.200]  Here's Caitlin Collins on CNN complaining about Musk has basically lived at Mar-a-Lago since the election.
[03:29:10.600 --> 03:29:12.500]  Let's listen to CNN whine about this.
[03:29:12.559 --> 03:29:12.840]  Here we go.
[03:29:13.829 --> 03:29:18.649]  Mar-a-Lago has basically been brimming for the last two days, I'm told, with two kinds of people.
[03:29:18.829 --> 03:29:24.430]  Those angling for a job and those who are trying to influence Trump into hiring their picks.
[03:29:24.670 --> 03:29:27.489]  But one person has loomed over all of that.
[03:29:27.629 --> 03:29:29.030]  His name is Elon Musk.
[03:29:29.479 --> 03:29:38.200]  Multiple sources tell me tonight that Musk has been seen at Mar-a-Lago nearly every single day since Donald Trump won, dining with him on the patio at times.
[03:29:38.420 --> 03:29:40.200]  Today they were seen on the golf course together.
[03:29:40.540 --> 03:29:43.540]  Musk has been in the room when world leaders have called Trump.
[03:29:43.760 --> 03:29:49.500]  And tonight we've learned he's also weighing in on staffing decisions, making clear his preference for certain roles even.
[03:29:50.200 --> 03:29:57.840]  Publicly tonight, Elon Musk is backing Florida Senator Rick Scott as the next leader of the Republican conference to replace Mitch McConnell.
[03:29:58.530 --> 03:30:14.350]  While Musk himself is still not expected to take any kind of formal position inside Trump's administration, given how complicated it would be with his companies, what's becoming clearer tonight is that he doesn't really need to, with one source telling me Elon Musk is having just as much influence from the outside.
[03:30:15.709 --> 03:30:16.270]  Good.
[03:30:17.530 --> 03:30:22.309]  So, you know, maybe those polls that he's putting out aren't so worthless.
[03:30:22.670 --> 03:30:24.370]  Maybe they do have some value.
[03:30:25.739 --> 03:30:29.899]  Maybe that poll where the vast majority say, hey, we don't want Thune or Cornyn.
[03:30:29.979 --> 03:30:31.399]  Basically anybody but those two.
[03:30:32.239 --> 03:30:32.600]  Anybody.
[03:30:34.100 --> 03:30:36.180]  Other got more than those two combined.
[03:30:36.959 --> 03:30:38.920]  Actually, more than double those two combined.
[03:30:40.459 --> 03:30:43.440]  And so I'm sure Musk is like, hey, you know, here's what the people want.
[03:30:43.540 --> 03:30:45.040]  And then Trump says, okay, that looks good.
[03:30:45.040 --> 03:30:45.819]  I'll go ahead and endorse.
[03:30:46.020 --> 03:30:47.120]  We'll call up Rick Scott.
[03:30:47.260 --> 03:30:48.219]  We'll bring him out to Mar-a-Lago.
[03:30:48.280 --> 03:30:48.920]  We'll talk to him.
[03:30:51.280 --> 03:30:59.260]  And then you have the other voices, like a Don Jr., Who's a little bit more of a social media hound, if you will.
[03:31:00.780 --> 03:31:02.000]  And maybe Musk.
[03:31:04.219 --> 03:31:10.899]  And they'll go show President Trump and they'll say, hey, here's some statements made by Thune in the past.
[03:31:11.079 --> 03:31:12.879]  Here's him bad-mouthing you on the air.
[03:31:13.000 --> 03:31:14.719]  Here's him bad-mouthing you in public statements.
[03:31:15.620 --> 03:31:16.500]  Oh, hmm.
[03:31:18.879 --> 03:31:24.659]  So, would the Republicans in the Senate really go against President Trump before he even gets into office?
[03:31:27.049 --> 03:31:28.489]  You really would hate to see that.
[03:31:28.690 --> 03:31:30.069]  You really would hate to see that.
[03:31:31.010 --> 03:31:33.469]  But that's Thune, Mitch McConnell with a pulse.
[03:31:34.049 --> 03:31:35.170]  That's all that is.
[03:31:35.690 --> 03:31:37.889]  John Thune is Mitch McConnell with a pulse.
[03:31:39.409 --> 03:31:44.569]  Meanwhile, Jim Jordan is asking the right questions.
[03:31:44.729 --> 03:31:50.209]  Now, what's ironic is it's Democrats, it's leftists in the media that are asking this question.
[03:31:50.510 --> 03:31:52.290]  Where did all the votes go?
[03:31:53.860 --> 03:31:56.340]  And they're crying Trump cheated, Trump rigged the election.
[03:31:56.479 --> 03:32:00.940]  It was a rigged election because Joe Biden's votes are a statistical anomaly.
[03:32:00.940 --> 03:32:02.639]  In fact, an impossibility.
[03:32:03.040 --> 03:32:04.479]  Where did the votes go?
[03:32:05.979 --> 03:32:13.219]  Jim Jordan is aligning himself with the Democrats that are saying, where are all the votes?
[03:32:13.459 --> 03:32:13.899]  Clip eight.
[03:32:14.899 --> 03:32:16.420]  Voting fraud this time.
[03:32:16.700 --> 03:32:26.500]  It seems to me that Republicans claim voting fraud and election integrity when you lose and not when you win.
[03:32:27.239 --> 03:32:27.799]  No.
[03:32:28.219 --> 03:32:36.739]  I mean, again, as I said before, this election, I think, was The greatest political comeback we've ever seen.
[03:32:36.860 --> 03:32:40.739]  He did something that even Teddy Roosevelt couldn't do, for goodness sake.
[03:32:41.799 --> 03:32:42.620]  And the country...
[03:32:42.620 --> 03:32:44.340]  But you think it was a free and fair election?
[03:32:44.479 --> 03:32:44.700]  No, no.
[03:32:44.840 --> 03:32:53.979]  This election, he just interviewed the Latino, I think, restaurant owner, a restaurant worker, and he said he was tired of all the woke stuff.
[03:32:54.120 --> 03:32:55.180]  This election was real simple.
[03:32:55.260 --> 03:32:56.600]  You had back-to-back administrations.
[03:32:56.700 --> 03:33:00.139]  We got something we very seldom get in American history, American politics.
[03:33:00.799 --> 03:33:03.059]  Back-to-back administrations now running for the top job.
[03:33:03.299 --> 03:33:04.559]  And people could do a direct comparison.
[03:33:04.780 --> 03:33:07.700]  And they said, we like what we had under President Trump versus...
[03:33:07.700 --> 03:33:08.500]  But last time around...
[03:33:08.500 --> 03:33:11.020]  We like the safe streets versus the record crime.
[03:33:11.040 --> 03:33:14.819]  Last time around, your leader claimed that there were problems with fraud.
[03:33:14.819 --> 03:33:16.979]  We like the secure order versus the open border.
[03:33:17.000 --> 03:33:17.079]  Right.
[03:33:17.239 --> 03:33:18.420]  Those are policies.
[03:33:18.440 --> 03:33:19.760]  That's what this election was about.
[03:33:20.379 --> 03:33:22.059]  That's totally fair.
[03:33:22.709 --> 03:33:28.709]  But last time around, it wasn't so much about the policy differences or the personality differences.
[03:33:29.090 --> 03:33:35.670]  There were false claims about election fraud when Donald Trump lost.
[03:33:35.850 --> 03:33:39.590]  This time, Donald Trump won, and you think the election was free and fair.
[03:33:39.850 --> 03:33:46.829]  You see there's a little bit of a No, I think the Democrats got to ask, why did we go from getting 81 million to getting 70 million?
[03:33:46.909 --> 03:33:48.170]  What happened to those 10 million people?
[03:33:48.409 --> 03:33:53.329]  Maybe it's not smart to run an election where you have no vision, no record to run on.
[03:33:53.329 --> 03:33:58.110]  Do you believe that the 2024 election was free and fair?
[03:33:58.290 --> 03:33:58.610]  I do.
[03:33:58.750 --> 03:33:59.190]  I do.
[03:34:00.239 --> 03:34:03.319]  And why was it different from 2020 when he lost?
[03:34:03.500 --> 03:34:04.620]  Is that the only difference?
[03:34:05.020 --> 03:34:08.899]  No, there were concerns about 2020 with all the mail-in voting that happened.
[03:34:09.440 --> 03:34:16.700]  Pennsylvania had like two point something million mail-in ballots come in without any signature verification, which was required under Pennsylvania statute.
[03:34:16.920 --> 03:34:20.540]  So there were all kinds of concerns with how the 2020 election was carried out.
[03:34:20.799 --> 03:34:21.100]  But...
[03:34:22.239 --> 03:34:28.479]  The biggest question Democrats need to be asking, what happened to the 10 million voters that Joe Biden got that didn't come out for Kamala Harris?
[03:34:28.639 --> 03:34:33.340]  A bunch of them, President Trump's numbers were right up where they were in 2020, but the Democrats were much lower.
[03:34:33.500 --> 03:34:39.000]  I think it's because they had no vision, no record to run on, and they just wanted to call everyone names.
[03:34:39.159 --> 03:34:46.659]  Turns out when you tell people, oh, you're fascist, racist, deplorable garbage, they don't like that.
[03:34:46.659 --> 03:34:50.100]  And then when you use lawfare to go after their candidate, they don't like that either.
[03:34:50.379 --> 03:34:51.520]  That's why they came out so...
[03:34:51.700 --> 03:34:57.979]  On top of the economy, on top of the price of gas, on top of the inflation, that's why they voted for President Trump.
[03:34:58.159 --> 03:34:58.520]  We're out of time.
[03:34:59.520 --> 03:35:04.959]  I'd actually like to hear a Democrat, I'd actually like to hear a liberal progressive answer that question.
[03:35:05.760 --> 03:35:12.860]  Why did Kamala Harris, I don't know what the final numbers are, they're still counting in some states, but it'll be about 10 million less, give or take.
[03:35:13.680 --> 03:35:17.020]  Why did Kamala Harris get 10 million less than Joe Biden?
[03:35:20.000 --> 03:35:21.700]  Was it that bad of a campaign?
[03:35:22.780 --> 03:35:25.219]  Was it that bad of a ticket, Harris-Walls?
[03:35:26.299 --> 03:35:31.139]  Were the policies of the Biden administration that Harris can't escape that bad?
[03:35:32.700 --> 03:35:34.739]  Or was there something else at play?
[03:35:36.360 --> 03:35:39.299]  Now, of course, to me, the answer is obvious.
[03:35:40.739 --> 03:35:43.559]  They had millions of mail-in votes that they didn't have this time.
[03:35:44.079 --> 03:35:50.979]  They had their vote harvesting, their ballot drop box mules that they didn't have this time.
[03:35:52.959 --> 03:35:58.959]  They tried in multiple cities to stuff the ballots after the election night.
[03:35:59.120 --> 03:35:59.739]  They got caught.
[03:35:59.899 --> 03:36:02.540]  Republican lawyers, poll watchers were there.
[03:36:03.239 --> 03:36:04.719]  Undercover journalists were there filming.
[03:36:04.940 --> 03:36:05.459]  They got caught.
[03:36:06.639 --> 03:36:08.680]  They couldn't do the fake water main breaks.
[03:36:10.879 --> 03:36:20.420]  So with the mail-in ballots and everything else, yeah, you probably had the vote steroids for Biden completely illegally, completely illegitimately.
[03:36:21.319 --> 03:36:22.579]  But I'd like to know.
[03:36:23.600 --> 03:36:26.079]  Because the Democrats are the ones that have a reckoning here.
[03:36:27.180 --> 03:36:30.079]  Are they going to have to side with, well...
[03:36:30.669 --> 03:36:32.110]  Biden's victory was illegitimate?
[03:36:32.149 --> 03:36:41.530]  Or are they going to have to admit that they back bad policies, they back bad rhetoric, and the Harris-Wolves ticket was pathetic?
[03:36:44.430 --> 03:36:49.030]  Either way, they're going to have to admit they were wrong, which they'll never do.
[03:36:51.010 --> 03:36:52.170]  So why don't they answer the question?
[03:36:52.329 --> 03:36:56.510]  Why don't the Democrats answer the question as to what happened to the 10 million votes?
[03:36:56.670 --> 03:36:58.510]  How did Biden do so much better?
[03:36:58.969 --> 03:37:08.190]  All right, this is their big plan to, I guess, save Kamala from ending her political career in such an embarrassing manner.
[03:37:08.409 --> 03:37:11.670]  It's not going to happen, but this is the CNN pipe dream in clip 14.
[03:37:12.700 --> 03:37:13.479]  ...is looking for.
[03:37:13.600 --> 03:37:14.239]  That is my question.
[03:37:14.360 --> 03:37:14.879]  I'll start with you.
[03:37:15.100 --> 03:37:16.579]  Joe Biden's been a phenomenal president.
[03:37:16.760 --> 03:37:18.399]  He's lived up to so many of the promises he's made.
[03:37:18.520 --> 03:37:21.579]  There's one promise left that he could fulfill, being a transitional figure.
[03:37:21.700 --> 03:37:26.239]  He could resign the presidency in the next 30 days, make Kamala Harris the president of the United States.
[03:37:26.299 --> 03:37:27.340]  He would absolve him.
[03:37:27.829 --> 03:37:33.790]  From having to oversee the January 6th transition, right, of her own defeat.
[03:37:34.290 --> 03:37:44.370]  And it would make sure that it would dominate the news at a point where Democrats have to learn drama and transparency and doing things that the public would want to see.
[03:37:44.729 --> 03:37:48.790]  This is the moment for us to change the entire perspective of how Democrats operate.
[03:37:48.790 --> 03:37:52.809]  Okay, this has now jumped from an internet meme to a Sunday morning show.
[03:37:52.930 --> 03:37:54.969]  Jamal's out here right now in the season of House of Cards.
[03:37:56.840 --> 03:37:58.680]  I thought you were going to say, what about the Supreme Court?
[03:37:58.819 --> 03:37:59.620]  That's also out there.
[03:37:59.780 --> 03:38:00.700]  Well, the Supreme Court might happen.
[03:38:00.739 --> 03:38:02.739]  I don't know if it will, but I think this is something that's...
[03:38:02.739 --> 03:38:05.739]  It won't, and it also won't.
[03:38:07.840 --> 03:38:11.420]  Biden is on Team Trump now, begging for a pardon, okay?
[03:38:11.879 --> 03:38:13.020]  In case you haven't noticed.
[03:38:14.280 --> 03:38:17.860]  Of all the Democrats, they're all pouting and whining and...
[03:38:18.780 --> 03:38:19.719]  Moping around.
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:20.899]  Biden is not.
[03:38:21.100 --> 03:38:22.340]  Biden is cheery.
[03:38:22.739 --> 03:38:24.079]  Biden is smiling.
[03:38:24.459 --> 03:38:26.079]  Biden is wearing trumpets.
[03:38:26.239 --> 03:38:29.260]  Jill Biden is wearing red on election day.
[03:38:31.260 --> 03:38:34.020]  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are not friendly.
[03:38:35.659 --> 03:38:39.520]  They ran a coup on Joe Biden and embarrassed him, and he's ticked about it.
[03:38:40.659 --> 03:38:41.260]  So...
[03:38:43.260 --> 03:38:49.100]  I look at the political party right now, the Democrats, and I look at a party that's deflated.
[03:38:50.360 --> 03:38:55.659]  And probably, let's say the adults are about to take over the situation.
[03:38:55.659 --> 03:39:02.959]  Now, I don't like either one of these guys' policies or as individuals, but now what you have going on is...
[03:39:04.130 --> 03:39:13.329]  Gavin Newsom and Josh Shapiro are looking at this absolute dumpster fire that is the Democrat Party and they're wringing their hands and they're saying, okay, the party's ours for the taking.
[03:39:14.870 --> 03:39:17.590]  And they're not going to be, and they don't want any of this crap to go on.
[03:39:17.809 --> 03:39:19.569]  And they're probably even talking to Biden.
[03:39:19.709 --> 03:39:22.389]  They're like, hey, this deal is already bad enough.
[03:39:22.909 --> 03:39:24.450]  We got to just retreat.
[03:39:25.319 --> 03:39:27.459]  We have to politically retreat now.
[03:39:27.520 --> 03:39:30.399]  If we get crazier now, it's only going to hurt us in the midterms.
[03:39:30.659 --> 03:39:34.860]  If we get crazier now, it's only going to hurt us in these states that are now trending the wrong way.
[03:39:36.200 --> 03:39:36.840]  So no.
[03:39:37.979 --> 03:39:38.340]  No.
[03:39:38.620 --> 03:39:40.799]  Kamala Harris is not going to be on the Supreme Court.
[03:39:40.959 --> 03:39:42.959]  Kamala Harris is not going to be the first female president.
[03:39:43.139 --> 03:39:44.760]  Joe Biden is not on your team anymore.
[03:39:44.940 --> 03:39:46.000]  You threw him under the bus.
[03:39:46.180 --> 03:39:47.340]  He doesn't like Kamala.
[03:39:47.520 --> 03:39:48.079]  It's over.
[03:39:48.540 --> 03:39:50.700]  Kamala's out drinking a bunch of wine.
[03:39:51.360 --> 03:39:53.819]  I mean, that's actually documented now.
[03:39:55.520 --> 03:40:00.879]  When her niece uploaded a picture of them playing and she's got glasses of wine.
[03:40:02.500 --> 03:40:03.620]  So, hey, good for her.
[03:40:03.799 --> 03:40:05.799]  She needs to just ride off into the sunset as well.
[03:40:06.000 --> 03:40:08.659]  It's an embarrassing end to her political career, but it is what it is.
[03:40:08.799 --> 03:40:09.700]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:40:10.899 --> 03:40:14.120]  I'm going to get into my political analysis and news.
[03:40:14.340 --> 03:40:16.579]  Plus, we're going to do a veterans call-in special.
[03:40:16.739 --> 03:40:17.600]  It is Veterans Day.
[03:40:17.719 --> 03:40:28.200]  We love our veterans here at InfoWars, so we're doing a veterans call-in special today on the InfoWars War Room, coming up in T-minus five minutes in the other studio.
[03:40:28.200 --> 03:40:31.540]  I'm about to hop on over to the other studio.
[03:40:32.079 --> 03:40:34.000]  InfoWars lives on another day.
[03:40:34.000 --> 03:40:38.040]  I'll see you on the InfoWars War Room in five minutes.
[03:40:44.040 --> 03:40:51.540]  Hey, this is Jeff with DMO Knives, and we're proud to come back to you with our second partnership with Alex Jones.

[03:41:08.399 --> 03:41:16.299]  We'll have solid black G10 composite handles inserted with Cerakote screws which are in the color of black as well.

[03:41:52.950 --> 03:41:54.709]  And we'd like to keep it as simple as possible.
[03:41:54.930 --> 03:42:03.989]  So, at checkout, you have the option for this, which is a nice acrylic stand, really super easy to put together if you would just simply like to display your knife.

[03:42:23.479 --> 03:42:32.620]  But if you want to be a part of this particular partnership, Alex Jones and the Stonewash Outback, you need to go to dmonives.com and get yours today.
[03:42:32.860 --> 03:42:37.680]  American made by American people right here at our workshop in Fayetteville, Arkansas.
[03:42:38.219 --> 03:42:40.379]  They are built to never fail the operator.
[03:43:00.319 --> 03:43:03.579]  We brought in a lot of money at the yellowstonestore.com to our sponsor.
[03:43:03.819 --> 03:43:04.819]  And they're great guys.
[03:43:04.959 --> 03:43:05.559]  They're great marketers.
[03:43:05.680 --> 03:43:06.059]  They're bigly.
[03:43:06.159 --> 03:43:10.579]  They produce the best Trump shirts and are big sponsors for Stephen Crowder and the Hodge twins and so many others.
[03:43:11.239 --> 03:43:13.899]  I had little talks with them though because I see the numbers.
[03:43:13.899 --> 03:43:17.379]  I'm like, you're selling the CMOS for 55% off.
[03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:20.920]  And then you give VIP members another discount?
[03:43:21.139 --> 03:43:22.219]  And I go, let me see the numbers.
[03:43:22.379 --> 03:43:25.959]  Oh, actually, some of these deals we lose money, but we're getting new customers.
[03:43:26.040 --> 03:43:26.500]  They're going to love it.
[03:43:26.500 --> 03:43:26.979]  I'm like...
[03:43:28.049 --> 03:43:34.030]  Okay, let's have a couple fundraiser t-shirts that are 50 bucks so we actually, you know, get 20-something bucks.
[03:43:35.229 --> 03:43:36.489]  You know, after all the cost.
[03:43:36.729 --> 03:43:38.370]  And I'm not complaining, I'm just saying.
[03:43:38.549 --> 03:43:40.270]  So, I had an idea two weeks ago.
[03:43:40.930 --> 03:43:42.569]  We'll do a wide shot so you can see these.
[03:43:43.129 --> 03:43:51.530]  And I said, okay, I want a red on black classic InfoWars that says 1776 worldwide, 2024, my signature.
[03:43:52.649 --> 03:43:55.430]  Historic, looks great in your office, great wherever, you know you support us.
[03:43:55.530 --> 03:43:59.790]  Whatever happens to InfoWars that survives is even cooler, doesn't survive, you've got the memento, and it helps fund the future.
[03:44:00.799 --> 03:44:03.520]  An Alex Jones style Star Wars fun thing we came up with.
[03:44:03.760 --> 03:44:08.020]  And then the other thing I designed, white on black InfoWars lives forever with my signature.
[03:44:08.440 --> 03:44:09.260]  It's right there.
[03:44:09.579 --> 03:44:11.579]  There are only a few thousand of each one of these.
[03:44:11.719 --> 03:44:12.600]  They're limited edition.
[03:44:13.319 --> 03:44:20.840]  This is literally you knowing you back the second American Revolution at such a critical time while we've gone over the top, while we have the initiative, while this is all happening.
[03:44:21.239 --> 03:44:26.479]  So these things cost like $5 to print because they are high quality and they're on like a poster boards.
[03:44:26.639 --> 03:44:27.280]  They're thick.
[03:44:27.420 --> 03:44:27.739]  They're nice.
[03:44:27.899 --> 03:44:29.000]  It's a particularly good movie poster.
[03:44:30.670 --> 03:44:34.629]  And then the tube and all that's like six, seven bucks, eight bucks per unit.
[03:44:35.190 --> 03:44:43.489]  With 50 bucks, you know, we're getting like, you know, they get part of their operations, but we're getting 20-something bucks for each poster for the operation.
[03:44:43.770 --> 03:44:50.329]  So if folks just go buy the posters, if people buy them right now, you'll hear me when I come back on Sunday and Monday.
[03:44:50.430 --> 03:44:50.829]  I won't be up here.
[03:44:50.870 --> 03:44:52.110]  Please, please help me, help me, help me.
[03:44:52.809 --> 03:44:56.149]  If you go get those, we'll have the money and some runway out a few months.
[03:44:57.860 --> 03:44:58.700]  But the legal, everything else.
[03:44:58.819 --> 03:45:01.639]  So if you want to keep the show on the air, this is the action point.
[03:45:02.860 --> 03:45:10.399]  TheAlexJonesStore.com And all the supplements are great, and all the t-shirts are great, and just, you know, everything's amazing.
[03:45:11.379 --> 03:45:20.879]  It's just when they're selling a t-shirt for 25, 30 bucks, and the t-shirt costs $15, or it's an XXXL, $17, and then they've got their expenses, and their crew, and the legal, and all this stuff, and then we...
[03:45:20.879 --> 03:45:23.379]  Not a lot of money.
[03:45:24.260 --> 03:45:28.120]  So these are the things you get If you really want to support us.
[03:45:28.340 --> 03:45:30.040]  And all the Trump gears in, it's amazing.
[03:45:30.159 --> 03:45:30.639]  Trump won.
[03:45:30.860 --> 03:45:32.379]  I think these are the best designs out there.
[03:45:32.479 --> 03:45:33.399]  I'm proud of these guys.
[03:45:33.600 --> 03:45:34.799]  I love the work they're doing.
[03:45:35.719 --> 03:45:37.360]  And it's all there.
[03:45:38.000 --> 03:45:41.219]  So, thealexjonesstore.com, three limited edition posters.
[03:45:41.840 --> 03:45:43.600]  I designed the red one and the white one.
[03:45:43.959 --> 03:45:45.459]  I mean, I've literally made those.
[03:45:45.840 --> 03:45:48.440]  And they're simple and they're very strong, very clean.
[03:45:49.360 --> 03:45:51.139]  It's my original design for the Inforge logo.
[03:45:51.920 --> 03:45:53.879]  And then the middle one, I said, why don't we have a Star Wars one?
[03:45:54.299 --> 03:46:00.420]  Kind of a fun thing, you know, for somebody, like, if you've got a little arcade in your house with video games or pool table or whatever.
[03:46:02.579 --> 03:46:06.299]  I used to have a bigger house, but I don't have a room for a pool table now, but if I did, that'd be hanging in my house.
[03:46:06.360 --> 03:46:06.780]  That's fun.
[03:46:07.979 --> 03:46:09.700]  And so, it's all there.
[03:46:09.959 --> 03:46:10.940]  To me, it's a no-brainer.
[03:46:11.040 --> 03:46:13.200]  I want to thank you respectfully for everything you've done.
[03:46:13.540 --> 03:46:15.540]  I want to thank God for leading guiding directors.
[03:46:15.659 --> 03:46:15.920]  It's been incredible.
[03:46:15.979 --> 03:46:20.989]  I want to thank the crew for putting up with me, because They understand, but I've been a jerk lately.
[03:46:20.989 --> 03:46:21.530]  I'll admit it.
[03:46:21.670 --> 03:46:22.329]  I try to repent.
[03:46:22.530 --> 03:46:24.790]  I try to not be so angry, but this is our whole future.
[03:46:24.870 --> 03:46:25.229]  They get it.
[03:46:25.290 --> 03:46:25.989]  They're pissed off, too.
[03:46:26.450 --> 03:46:34.750]  They've been busting their ass, and I'd sure like to not just, whether we survive or have to set up a new operation, it'd be nice to give these guys a bonus and maybe a raise.
[03:46:34.850 --> 03:46:39.270]  They haven't had bonuses or raises in over two years, and they're a badass team, so I salute them.
[03:46:39.389 --> 03:46:46.950]  So for all of us here at the Infowars family, whatever happens, it's all in God's plan, but God works through you, so take action now and be part of the fundraiser.
[03:46:47.090 --> 03:46:48.170]  Get the posters now.
