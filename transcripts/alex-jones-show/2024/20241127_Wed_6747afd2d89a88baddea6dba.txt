[00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:30.910]  It's Wednesday, November 27, 2024, and President Trump is still silent on the start of World War III. InfoWars.
[00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.670]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:44.250]  It is Wednesday, November 27th, 2024. I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the embattled InfoWars studios in Central Texas.
[00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.109]  All right.
[00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.229]  We've got special guests joining us today.
[00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.390]  I'm going to take a lot of phone calls.
[00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:54.090]  Massive news, good news, bad news, insane news, ugly news, beautiful news.
[00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:55.350]  It's all coming up.
[00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.369]  53 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, 6 seconds.
[00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.039]  Until President Trump is inaugurated.
[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.600]  Wow, the quickening is here.
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.420]  I've got a lot of predictions I'm going to make today.
[00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:08.000]  A lot of big World War III developments.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:18.420]  But first, this is a short compilation of some of my previous predictions so new viewers and listeners know that they need to listen to what I'm saying because I've got my head in the game.
[00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:35.870]  Today, in 2002, there is a tyrannical organization calling itself the New World Order, pushing for worldwide government, a cashless society, open borders, total and complete tyranny.
[00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.989]  By the middle of September, that the new policy's being written, you will all have to wear masks again and so will airport employees.
[00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.290]  It's happening.
[00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.650]  Mask mandates are officially back.
[00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.370]  We know the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to blow up airliners, Baltimore Sun, or if you let some terrorist group do it, like the World Trade Center, we know who to blame.
[00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:00.650]  And if there was an outside threat like a bin Laden who was a known CIA asset in the 80s...
[00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.569]  This group and its leader, a person named Osama bin Laden...
[00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.010]  He's the boogeyman they need.
[00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.790]  We're looking at a giant war in February right now.
[00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.990]  I predict the Russians are going to roll in.
[00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.909]  They're already there.
[00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.650]  They're going to roll in.
[00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:15.389]  With attacks across Ukraine, which is the size of Texas.
[00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.129]  It really was the Iraqis.
[00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:18.849]  That's just because they're getting ready to invade Iraq.
[00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.370]  What a beautiful setup.
[00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.090]  American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq.
[00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:34.409]  Get ready, because we've had enough after this white supremacist or whoever it is they, you know, set up, went and did this horrible event.
[00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:38.169]  If you want to stop these folks, you've got to be basically eyes and ears.
[00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.789]  And they're going to hit at night.
[00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:42.009]  They're going to start at about 10 o'clock at night.
[00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.530]  A storm of gunfire raining down upon an innocent crowd.
[00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.469]  It started at 10.08 p.m.
[00:02:48.379 --> 00:03:02.960]  Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, and it gets into controlling food, the environment, total control, martial law, millions dead, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, biometric IDs to travel, to live.
[00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.689]  Read what these monsters are planning for you.
[00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:17.530]  A bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to counter a global problem, and the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.310]  It may not be this year, but this is the globalist plan.
[00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:31.270]  So if you start seeing a bunch of people die in China, and you see it, oh, a thousand dead, a hundred thousand dead, and by the time you hear it's a hundred thousand dead, it'll be here on these airplanes, and you won't have anywhere to go.
[00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.189]  People ask me why I've got so much energy.
[00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.069]  Well, I know how beautiful and special this planet is and how much danger we're in when we're asleep at the switch.
[00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:45.810]  All right.
[00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.250]  We're good to go.
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.159]  There's now been a bunch of death threats and bomb threats against basically the entire new Trump administration.
[00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:16.040]  We'll get into that.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:26.399]  Kamala Harris has surfaced after being gone for three weeks from Hawaii looking like she's 20 years older and on a bunch of downers.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:42.490]  We've got We've got more reports confirming Fauci did secret illegal medical experiments killing tens of thousands of children.
[00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.430]  We're going to get into that.
[00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.750]  We've got a big broadcast for you today.
[00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.689]  Remember, you're the Paul Revere's.
[00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.389]  However you're listening, share those links now.
[00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.089]  Stay with us.
[00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.149]  It is Wednesday, November 27, 2024, year of our Lord.
[00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.810]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and I am very thankful that we are not yet in a full nuclear war.
[00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:09.069]  I am very thankful for people coming together and getting President Trump elected.
[00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:14.350]  I'm very thankful for the audience of activists that are at the heart of the global resistance against the new world order.
[00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:23.129]  I am very thankful for Joe Rogan getting hardcore, Elon Musk getting hardcore, and so many others.
[00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:34.740]  There has just been a mass coming out From Silicon Valley and the big banks and academia saying, yeah, the New World Order is really a horrible death cult.
[00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.800]  We need to stop it.
[00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:43.620]  Now, we are going to just cover massive amounts of critical news and information today.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.699]  I'm also going to take a lot of your phone calls on this eve of Thanksgiving.
[00:05:49.819 --> 00:06:02.910]  And I am again very, very honored and blessed to be in a position to be talking to folks today Being listened to by people all over the world and on over 450 radio stations, over 200 cable and TV stations.
[00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:22.170]  Massive numbers at Infowars.com forward slash show, band out video, and of course the mighty X at Real Alex Jones and at AJN Live on X. We have some fabulous news today.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:33.420]  Not just in the United States, not just in Europe, not just in the UK, not just in Canada, not just in Africa, Asia, Latin America, I mean, everywhere.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:51.220]  The world is really waking up to how the private handful of central banks and private owners control the planet and led by Ken Paxton, Texas AG, who is completely embattled with all their fake attempts to put him in prison.
[00:06:52.930 --> 00:07:03.589]  It has spread all over the world, and now 11 GOP states are devastating.
[00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:10.350]  BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, that's all the same consortium, a monopoly.
[00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.509]  87% of world assets.
[00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:22.250]  The people behind all the brainwashing, all of the DEI garbage.
[00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:25.730]  And they're not just filing lawsuits.
[00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.930]  The state funds are divesting of BlackRock.
[00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:34.290]  The school board funds are divesting of BlackRock.
[00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:41.870]  Major European regions are divesting of BlackRock from Germany to Italy to South Korea.
[00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.829]  I mean, it is happening.
[00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:55.620]  And when you pull your money out of BlackRock management, Because it's not their money, 90 plus percent of it.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.379]  It's your pension funds.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.920]  It's your stock market portfolio.
[00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:02.000]  It's your mutual funds.
[00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:04.860]  It's your retirement funds.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:17.800]  When you pull it from them, then the entire globalist ESG corporate social credit score comes crashing down.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.810]  Joe Rogan, two days ago, We interviewed him two days ago.
[00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:22.350]  It aired yesterday.
[00:08:22.529 --> 00:08:23.269]  It's gone super viral.
[00:08:23.829 --> 00:08:29.050]  Had one of the top tech expert mogul engineers on.
[00:08:29.129 --> 00:08:36.210]  I got a bunch of clips of Mark Anderson laying out how all this works.
[00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:53.820]  And so you'll hear him say exactly what I've said, but in his own precision way about how there is this entire globalist technocracy using corporate ESG scores To control every facet of civilization.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:10.320]  And just as Eisenhower warned of the military industrial complex being controlled by a technocracy that would create a monopoly of funding and thought, he explains that most of Silicon Valley has really been libertarian and anti-globalist for decades.
[00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:26.820]  But that They are surveilled, not just what they do publicly, and that when they get caught even talking to people about going against the globalist, for decades they get debanked.
[00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:34.279]  See, it didn't really start with Alex Jones, or end with Donald Trump, or Loris Lerner under Obama.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:43.379]  Auditing millions of conservatives just because they were Republican voters and shutting down tens of thousands of conservative and Christian nonprofits.
[00:09:43.419 --> 00:09:46.820]  I mean, that was totally criminal and they admitted they did it.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.000]  It's much bigger than that.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.440]  So everything we know about is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.480]  But neat that, this has been going on a long time and now they're codifying it.
[00:09:57.559 --> 00:09:58.279]  And when you get...
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:23.200]  More than 100 governments, and I've got the articles right here, and 10 U.S. states and different states all over Europe, not yet at national government levels, literally pulling trillions out of the BlackRock Consortium,
[00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:27.440]  the globalist corporate control arm for social control.
[00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.330]  That's the key to their whole takeover plan.
[00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.350]  You go right at the head of the snake.
[00:10:34.309 --> 00:10:48.009]  And so there's been all these people under this for decades that were scared and who'd been persecuted but quietly took it because there wasn't enough people to stand up to win.
[00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.009]  Courage is contagious.
[00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:52.350]  And he talks about that on Rogan.
[00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.110]  How people were scared.
[00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:56.870]  I mean, he's not been scared.
[00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.429]  He's been talking about this for a long time.
[00:10:59.029 --> 00:11:00.730]  But others were scared.
[00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:05.730]  And Rogan goes, well, thank God we've got all you really smart people smarter than us.
[00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:10.950]  I mean, you know, Mike Lindell's been saying this stuff for a long time.
[00:11:11.049 --> 00:11:12.389]  But, you know, he's Mike Lindell.
[00:11:12.649 --> 00:11:14.330]  And I get what Rogan's saying.
[00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.350]  But Mike's a great guy.
[00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:17.429]  And super smart and has a lot of courage.
[00:11:18.649 --> 00:11:47.299]  But the point is, is that I'm not mad about the fact that this broadcast and Ron Paul and our audience of activists have gone through the most hell and that we're the original OGs and that we then territorialize the fact that our movement is now the dominant global exploding awakening renaissance but Okay,
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.360]  now we can have all the 200 IQ people on our side.
[00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:52.000]  Well, a lot of them have been on our side.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:59.639]  They just did not think it was the right time publicly to move against this.
[00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:01.360]  But I will say this.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:17.429]  People like myself and Mike Lindell, targeted by the deep state, pushed to the edge of oblivion financially, meaning being able to run our operations, Need to be supported,
[00:12:17.669 --> 00:12:17.830]  though.
[00:12:18.149 --> 00:12:19.549]  That would kind of be nice.
[00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.570]  And again, I'm not a victim.
[00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:22.529]  I'm not butthurt.
[00:12:23.049 --> 00:12:25.049]  I'm not even complaining.
[00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:40.950]  I'm just saying that if we don't celebrate the people that fight the system, then other people aren't going to join our bandwagon of defeating the globalist death cult,
[00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.269]  deindustrialization, depopulation system.
[00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:56.809]  Now, Elon Musk has taken the controls off of myself and many others on X. We can look at the numbers.
[00:12:56.809 --> 00:12:58.110]  He's not boosting us.
[00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:07.190]  He's just gotten out of the way for innovation, like people are fighting to get people out of his way for innovation.
[00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.389]  Lead, follow, or get out of the way.
[00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:16.269]  But he has come to my aid in the fake court cases and the lawfare and the rest of it.
[00:13:16.549 --> 00:13:25.830]  And there are being some things with folks associated with him, I'll just leave it at that, that will be deployed against the bad guys legally and lawfully very, very soon.
[00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:29.970]  But just in general, I wanted to just point out where we are right now.
[00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.049]  Humanity's already starting to really wake up fast.
[00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.649]  People are getting educated and informed about what happened while they were asleep.
[00:13:39.039 --> 00:13:41.700]  There's an exponential explosion in understanding.
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.539]  We're just in the first stages of it.
[00:13:44.259 --> 00:13:56.720]  And if the globalists don't trigger a nuclear war or a super deadly virus or a cyber attack they blame on Russia and knock out the power for six months, they're going to lose.
[00:13:56.919 --> 00:14:14.149]  And if they do go to the Samson option of toppling the system immediately, Around them and us, you can follow that line, and in no scenario do the globalists ever survive this.
[00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.649]  So they can kill us along with themselves.
[00:14:17.529 --> 00:14:19.730]  So it's important just to restate that.
[00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:27.159]  And they know that, and that's why There's different competing factions and groups and organizations.
[00:14:27.559 --> 00:14:45.159]  And the private central banks, by bullying and intimidation, have gotten most of the world to adopt their transhumanist deindustrialization, depopulation plan for dystopia by design for 99.9% of the people in the world.
[00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:59.940]  And now that that tiny group of satanic people Jealous, greedy scum realizes you're never going to get away with taking everything from the majority of us and killing most of us.
[00:15:00.559 --> 00:15:02.100]  Not when you're spotlighted.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.980]  Not when I've lit your ass up.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:09.759]  And my activist audience in the arena, men and women in the arena, have lit your ass up.
[00:15:09.759 --> 00:15:12.440]  We have lazed your ass.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.940]  Politically, non-violently.
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.500]  People that don't know, that goes back to the 50s.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:27.440]  They would just use different ultra-violent or different lights that could be seen by scanners on the aircraft.
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:47.649]  And the special forces would get parachuted in behind enemy lines, and then they would spotlight with a light different types of light that the visual eye couldn't see But that the aircraft could see to drop its missiles or bombs.
[00:15:47.909 --> 00:15:59.230]  And then, of course, there's more high-tech versions of that today where they just, you know, geo-market and things like that using satellites.
[00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:04.159]  But that's what we've been doing is spotlighting cockroaches.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.080]  Ted Nugent always talks about that.
[00:16:06.539 --> 00:16:09.840]  And that's our job, is we spotlight the enemy.
[00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:23.480]  And then I just believe in humanity that if we expose their horrible, super wicked agenda, that most of you are going to be like me and go, I don't want to be poisoned and dumbed down and enslaved and then euthanized so a bunch of jerks can play God.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.240]  You know what?
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.299]  I'm going to fight your ass.
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.940]  I'm not looking for a fight.
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.740]  But if you really want one, you came to the right department.
[00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.309]  So, and I'm not talking about just me.
[00:16:34.429 --> 00:16:36.970]  I'm talking about you because I'll say this because it's important.
[00:16:38.149 --> 00:16:39.889]  There's no marketing department here.
[00:16:40.649 --> 00:16:44.710]  There's no focus groups are looking at what the public thinks.
[00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:46.710]  I mean, I see it in the news.
[00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.529]  Most of that's just fake PR telling you what you think.
[00:16:49.789 --> 00:16:54.090]  No, I think you're like me.
[00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:57.470]  Not everybody's like me, but I'm looking for people like me.
[00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.029]  So when I'm talking to you, I'm talking to myself.
[00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:01.799]  You want to know the agenda?
[00:17:02.379 --> 00:17:03.759]  You want to know who calls the shots?
[00:17:04.039 --> 00:17:04.339]  Me.
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.220]  And I know that you're the same.
[00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:11.700]  So they keep wondering, how does Jones continue to be ahead of all the trends?
[00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:13.920]  How does Jones continue to know what we're going to do before we do it?
[00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:21.759]  Because I... Treat the general public like they're me, including treating you good like you're me.
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.380]  That's Christ-like, and that's not even like I'm some goody-two-shoe.
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.700]  My genetics are that way.
[00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:31.359]  I have empathy because I understand if something's bad happening to you, it's going to happen to me.
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.200]  I feel it.
[00:17:33.059 --> 00:17:35.740]  These psychos, these sociopaths think that's a weakness.
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.140]  No, that's a strength.
[00:17:37.339 --> 00:17:43.160]  The fact that you don't feel that, that you don't see that, you're missing one of your senses, dumbasses.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.920]  My feelings being so strong is not because I'm weak.
[00:17:48.059 --> 00:17:49.099]  It's because I am strong.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:59.779]  Now, I don't make decisions off my feelings, but they are a sense that gives me perspective.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.460]  So, I do two things.
[00:18:05.599 --> 00:18:08.740]  I treat the general public like you're me and my family.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.779]  You are my family.
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.779]  I treat you like you are my family.
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.279]  That's what Texas hospitality is all about.
[00:18:15.069 --> 00:18:18.690]  And then the enemy, I study the most evil people on earth.
[00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:19.630]  I study them.
[00:18:19.769 --> 00:18:20.630]  I study their writings.
[00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.630]  And I put myself in their boots, as General Flynn said a few days ago.
[00:18:25.289 --> 00:18:27.309]  So I put myself in the boots of the enemy.
[00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:34.730]  And I know that the most horrible, evil thing I can think of, if I was thinking like them, they're going to do.
[00:18:34.849 --> 00:18:40.089]  And I can look at their pre-programming and what they're hyping and what they're lining up and their responses many phases out.
[00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.509]  And that's how I can guess what they're going to do and when they're going to do it.
[00:18:43.859 --> 00:18:51.039]  So, the reason I explain all this is for the general public that's already dialed in, super smart, you have some skills I don't have, I have some skills you don't have.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.579]  Together, we've got on-the-ground human intelligence.
[00:18:54.579 --> 00:18:55.299]  We're everywhere.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.339]  We're unstoppable.
[00:18:57.859 --> 00:19:00.700]  The globalists think that we're locked in here with them.
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.759]  No, they're locked in here with us.
[00:19:04.819 --> 00:19:06.759]  So, I want you to have a lot of confidence.
[00:19:09.019 --> 00:19:11.400]  In yourself, in humanity, because God made you.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:21.400]  Now, I'm going to get into all the news now, but I just wanted to be thankful on the day before Thanksgiving for you over the years.
[00:19:21.759 --> 00:19:25.539]  Because when I sit back and I look at the success of this broadcast...
[00:19:26.519 --> 00:19:30.480]  And the success of our films and reports and articles and news reporting.
[00:19:30.819 --> 00:19:32.680]  And I see the ripple effect.
[00:19:33.099 --> 00:19:40.519]  And I get recognized by thought leaders, publicly and privately, as being the genesis point.
[00:19:41.579 --> 00:19:45.099]  That that credit goes to you.
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.859]  And it goes to the crew.
[00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:52.440]  And it goes to anyone that has supported us by word of mouth, or financially, or with prayer.
[00:19:53.019 --> 00:19:55.660]  And you put those three things together, you're unstoppable.
[00:19:57.059 --> 00:20:11.190]  So, it is important to assess and to recognize The position and the office and the power that God gave us to exercise on this earth.
[00:20:11.369 --> 00:20:27.470]  And when we don't exercise our power and our will and let the light of God shine through us and God's will fill our sails on the seas of eternity, we fall to the enemy's plan and the enemy's operation.
[00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:33.140]  Just like Bob Dylan said, Let's come in with it at the bottom of the hour.
[00:20:33.519 --> 00:20:35.819]  You've got to serve somebody.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.920]  So are you going to serve the devil or are you going to serve God?
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:55.579]  It is very, very simple question, but a very important answer.
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.119]  The most important answer.
[00:20:58.429 --> 00:20:59.509]  Question and answer.
[00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:04.309]  Alright, let me do this, because I'm going to get into the war news, and then I'm going to go over everything else.
[00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.130]  Let me just tell you what's in these stacks.
[00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:08.769]  I kind of already did, but a few of them.
[00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.529]  Big article on InfoWars.com.
[00:21:13.049 --> 00:21:14.009]  Totally nails it.
[00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.650]  So important by Kellen McBrain.
[00:21:15.849 --> 00:21:17.170]  This story needs to be emailed.
[00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:19.410]  Everybody you know, text messages, reposted everywhere.
[00:21:19.829 --> 00:21:22.750]  I mean, this is high noon to vampires.
[00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.650]  This is silver bullets to werewolves.
[00:21:28.829 --> 00:21:30.049]  I mean, this is it.
[00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:32.329]  This is the way.
[00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:40.369]  11 GOP states sue Blackrock, State Street and Vanguard for conspiring to drive up energy costs.
[00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.490]  Now, I'm going to get more into that coming up.
[00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:45.190]  That is so big.
[00:21:47.529 --> 00:21:50.869]  Then, obviously, we've got the massive ongoing escalations.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:58.539]  And just total push for sneak attacks on Russia and nuking them and just trying to go them in a nuclear war.
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:06.859]  But now we've seen a bunch of diplomatic behavior from NATO, from the UK and from Russia.
[00:22:07.539 --> 00:22:12.940]  We see really concerning silence from President Trump.
[00:22:13.079 --> 00:22:16.539]  And I aired this last Tuesday when the bombs started raining down.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.579]  From the United States inside Russia.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.779]  And when the UK started bombing, I played that short Trump clip.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.400]  In fact, get it again.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.019]  I'm going to play it again.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.779]  Give me the exact date.
[00:22:25.839 --> 00:22:26.500]  It's over a year ago.
[00:22:26.839 --> 00:22:30.059]  Where he says it's going to lead to World War III. We don't want to bomb Russia because they weren't proposing it then.
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.920]  People all thought that was a new video.
[00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:32.440]  No, it's not.
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:39.920]  We have heard zero in the last two weeks from Trump on war and Ukraine.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.059]  When he first was president-elect on November 6th, we learned...
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:52.299]  That he talked to Zelensky with Elon Musk from Mar-a-Lago.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:23:00.319]  And it's been confirmed he's been talking to Putin and other leaders with shadow diplomacy and the head of NATO. Rut.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.240]  Root.
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.559]  But still nothing from Trump.
[00:23:06.779 --> 00:23:10.019]  I mean, I guarantee he makes a statement.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.900]  It'll have a billion views in two hours.
[00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:18.670]  I mean, everyone that's got access to a television on the internet on Earth will watch it over and over again.
[00:23:19.289 --> 00:23:21.349]  It'll have 10 billion views in a day.
[00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:26.970]  And great, maybe he's got them ready to cease fire.
[00:23:27.069 --> 00:23:28.269]  That's what I've been hearing he's trying to get.
[00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:29.329]  I know that.
[00:23:30.509 --> 00:23:40.990]  But if Putin hasn't proposed it, and Zelensky obviously isn't, Trump needs on the eve of Thanksgiving, it's the perfect time, as General Flynn said in the studio two days ago, to make this announcement.
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.779]  So, Wednesday, World War III alert.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:54.980]  World waits for President Trump to make a statement concerning the massive military escalations in Europe after Biden proposes giving nuclear weapons to Ukraine and NATO considers launching sneak attacks on Russia.
[00:23:55.119 --> 00:23:57.440]  I mean, if you're a new listener, you're like, what?
[00:23:57.619 --> 00:24:01.460]  That's all over the news in case you're hiding under a bridge or a rock or something.
[00:24:02.119 --> 00:24:05.599]  Okay, so, I mean, I'm not stupid.
[00:24:07.009 --> 00:24:08.789]  And I'm very well informed on this.
[00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:10.410]  And I know you are as well.
[00:24:10.589 --> 00:24:11.869]  That's why you tune in here.
[00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:14.470]  Not because you're learning it from me, but because you're informed.
[00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:15.150]  You want to learn more.
[00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:15.890]  We're all learning more together.
[00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:26.089]  But there's no reason in my mind, and I've been saying this for a couple of weeks, and I said, by today, I'm going to start getting really concerned.
[00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:26.970]  I am really concerned.
[00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:46.109]  There is absolutely no reason There is actually no reason that Trump has not made a statement at this point.
[00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:47.230]  It's only good.
[00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:48.730]  He needs to make it.
[00:24:48.809 --> 00:24:50.150]  He needs to call for global peace.
[00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:51.549]  He needs to call for de-escalation.
[00:24:52.849 --> 00:24:58.069]  And I'll talk about that more in the next segment, and there's so much other news I'll get to as well.
[00:24:58.089 --> 00:25:03.150]  We're going to hit those two big topics first, and then the appointments and everything that's happening.
[00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:04.710]  We're going to come right back in a moment.
[00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:07.089]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.789]  God bless you all.
[00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:31.650]  At thealochonestore.com, we have Ultimate Seamoss.
[00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:36.529]  It's private-labeled by a top-rated company here in the United States.
[00:25:36.829 --> 00:25:42.809]  Now, Seamoss is recognized as one of the top superfoods in the world, specifically Irish Seamoss.
[00:25:43.509 --> 00:25:44.109]  Then...
[00:25:44.519 --> 00:25:57.099]  We private labeled one of the top highest rated brands that in the capsules has the equivalent of 40 grams of concentrated sea moss in each serving, which is two powdered capsules.
[00:25:57.359 --> 00:25:58.940]  And that's just the start.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:04.960]  It's got two other superfoods, well, actually three in it as well.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.000]  So I guess that's four.
[00:26:06.599 --> 00:26:11.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, go to thealexjonesstore.com and check it out for yourself.

[00:27:12.329 --> 00:27:14.369]  Looks like their fraudulent sale won't go through.
[00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:21.829]  But regardless, I'm suing the daylights out of the Democratic Party and the big national gun control group that's actually behind the onion and has now admitted it in court.
[00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.730]  So, we also have backup studios at the Alex Jones Network.
[00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:31.829]  Whatever they do, we're staying on air to make sure Trump gets into office and to back him and his agenda to stop World War III, secure the borders, and more.
[00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.720]  But we We can't do it without your support.

[00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:06.470]  You are the resistance.
[00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:08.410]  Welcome back.
[00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:12.690]  We are 34 minutes into this live Wednesday, November 27th, 2024 transmission.
[00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:24.910]  We are 53 days out from President Trump being inaugurated and hopefully putting a stop to the insane escalation already in the first stages of World War III headed towards total thermal nuclear war bare minimum.
[00:28:25.369 --> 00:28:26.829]  A lot of other really nasty weapons.
[00:28:27.009 --> 00:28:29.190]  So here's the big issue.
[00:28:31.039 --> 00:28:32.819]  And we'll open the phones up next hour on this.
[00:28:34.339 --> 00:28:54.440]  President Trump has not made a statement, official statement, on stopping the escalation of the Ukraine war since March 16th of last year,
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.319]  a year and a half ago.
[00:29:00.599 --> 00:29:02.940]  Now, people have trouble believing this.
[00:29:03.079 --> 00:29:07.940]  When we aired this again last Tuesday, saying, here's Trump a year ago, he needs to do this again.
[00:29:08.599 --> 00:29:09.920]  People said, well, that's him now.
[00:29:10.079 --> 00:29:11.519]  And it went viral everywhere.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:18.220]  Over 130 million views just on my ex-account of the video.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.079]  And it was everywhere.
[00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.210]  But we thought to go get it and show it to people.
[00:29:23.329 --> 00:29:24.230]  Like, that's pretty important.
[00:29:24.609 --> 00:29:26.289]  Look, he's dead on here last year.
[00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:27.170]  He used to say this again.
[00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:29.630]  But I said, you know, I know he's doing the top behind the scenes.
[00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:30.269]  That's been admitted.
[00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:31.809]  Made some calls, confirmed it.
[00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:33.890]  Had a NATO went there last Thursday.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.579]  And I said, I'm going to give Trump the benefit of the doubt.
[00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:40.339]  We're going to wait a few more days.
[00:29:40.339 --> 00:29:43.599]  But I said, by the day before Thanksgiving, we're here now.
[00:29:44.019 --> 00:29:45.119]  You heard me say it.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:49.700]  If we haven't seen big statements, press conferences, I'm really concerned.
[00:29:49.859 --> 00:30:06.710]  Because I've sat here, I probably, since the election, probably spent, let's not exaggerate, Four or five days, if you count all the hours researching on this.
[00:30:06.829 --> 00:30:07.750]  I mean, I've just been...
[00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:15.190]  I've spent hours and hours a day, and I've sat there and racked my brain and talked to many other experts, publicly and privately.
[00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:19.150]  General Flynn on air, two hours in studio a couple days ago.
[00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:20.849]  He said he knows Trump.
[00:30:20.849 --> 00:30:21.970]  He talks to Trump all the time.
[00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:27.930]  He knows there's a detente going on, but he thinks Trump should have already made a statement, and he better make one by Wednesday.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.720]  November 27th, and we're here now.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.440]  And General Flynn said on air and off air to me, he says, I don't know.
[00:30:38.559 --> 00:30:39.440]  He goes, I'm going to call him.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.180]  I'm going to go see him.
[00:30:42.599 --> 00:30:46.779]  Because obviously he's waiting to get Putin to propose a ceasefire.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.099]  You know, we can't get Zelensky to do that because he's totally controlled.
[00:30:50.819 --> 00:30:53.400]  We know he wants a big win to announce.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.359]  I mean, we know why he's doing it, and I've been told that's why.
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:57.960]  I disagree with that.
[00:30:58.799 --> 00:31:23.960]  I think Trump calling for people to come to the table, everyone, and to list all the escalations and to say our world is too important and our past ancestors that fought so hard for our survival and our innovation and our touching the stars and for our current lives and for our future progeny We need to do this.
[00:31:24.079 --> 00:31:25.740]  Now, he did on the campaign trail.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.660]  In fact, I know we have a limited crew today.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.099]  A lot of people are already off, which they deserve.
[00:31:30.079 --> 00:31:31.700]  Have Dew and McBrain and some of the other guys.
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.880]  Everybody, because I know he did it.
[00:31:36.599 --> 00:31:56.400]  On the campaign trail, hell, on November 3rd, on that Sunday, He was in Pennsylvania and he did two other states.
[00:31:56.839 --> 00:32:01.599]  He said repeatedly he talked about stopping World War III. He goes, if you elect her, you get World War III with me.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:01.880]  You don't.
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:02.380]  And he elaborated.
[00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:06.059]  So let's find those clips that are the last time he did it.
[00:32:06.859 --> 00:32:08.440]  So go on X. It's the best place.
[00:32:08.519 --> 00:32:09.460]  It has the most of everything.
[00:32:11.359 --> 00:32:17.519]  Because God knows Google won't let you find Trump trying to stop World War III. They want to escalate all this.
[00:32:17.619 --> 00:32:18.240]  That's their policy.
[00:32:18.359 --> 00:32:20.700]  Their globalist operation.
[00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:27.289]  And I'll cover those as well and play those, but I mean, we need to hear from our commander-in-chief.
[00:32:27.309 --> 00:32:41.829]  We need to hear from the president-elect on this because, yeah, it'd be better to go ahead and announce that a ceasefire proposal's been made or a ceasefire's going to happen, and then there'll be a ceasefire until he gets in office on January 20th, 2025. I get that's what he wants is the big win up front.
[00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:44.230]  He needs to make that happen.
[00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:47.569]  That's why people elected him even more than the border or inflation.
[00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:57.009]  In the polls and what I saw on the street in my own gut, my own intellect, my own spirit said stopping World War III is first and foremost.
[00:32:57.289 --> 00:33:03.170]  Not just because it'll kill everybody on the surface of the earth, but just also the amount of money being spent.
[00:33:03.329 --> 00:33:04.289]  I mean, it's wrong.
[00:33:04.529 --> 00:33:05.109]  It's insane.
[00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:06.130]  NATO started it.
[00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:11.269]  George Soros has bragged about it on CNN. They confessed to this.
[00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:14.690]  So it's the right thing to do.
[00:33:16.069 --> 00:33:20.890]  And why we haven't heard from him is mind-boggling.
[00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:30.029]  So, we need to hear from Trump now.
[00:33:31.849 --> 00:33:34.430]  And he needs to reiterate with all the new information.
[00:33:35.309 --> 00:33:47.960]  And as he said, with Kamala, you get World War III. And Then he can say, well, here we are.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.079]  They obviously want to hand me a disaster before I get into office.
[00:33:53.559 --> 00:33:55.839]  I mean, that's what senior diplomats are saying.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.920]  It's what the Russians are saying.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.099]  It's what his son is saying.
[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:13.360]  The day that the U.S. and Biden started bombing Russia with the TACAMs, Don Jr. came out and said, the military-industrial complex is desperate to stop my dad from creating world peace, and they want to escalate to World War III before he gets in on January 20th.
[00:34:13.539 --> 00:34:15.019]  And that's dead on.
[00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:22.269]  Well, it's great to have Don Jr., but I noticed, because I've been checking, I haven't heard a lot more from Don since then.
[00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:26.329]  Somebody told Don, probably, hey, cool it.
[00:34:26.789 --> 00:34:30.230]  Let the big guy, let Senior do it.
[00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:44.710]  Well, much as I love Trump and want his agenda to succeed, because I'm about 95% aligned with it, and compared to the other people, it's night and day.
[00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:50.369]  I'm not going to stop.
[00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:52.349]  I know you're not either.
[00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:57.489]  Now, thank God there's already some big marches in Germany and Poland against the escalation.
[00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:00.070]  Finally, we've got videos of that coming up.
[00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:02.469]  But this is a big deal.
[00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:04.710]  So, put it back on screen.
[00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:07.889]  They did find him on a...
[00:35:07.889 --> 00:35:10.829]  Scroll up a little so I can get the date for folks.
[00:35:10.909 --> 00:35:13.650]  Yeah, that was in PA. And that was November 3rd.
[00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:14.829]  See, my memory nailed it, folks.
[00:35:14.969 --> 00:35:16.150]  I don't just say this stuff.
[00:35:16.269 --> 00:35:17.670]  People say, this guy doesn't know all this.
[00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:21.210]  He rattles off numbers and dates and people, and he just wants...
[00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:21.869]  That's all crap.
[00:35:21.989 --> 00:35:22.690]  Nobody can...
[00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:23.710]  I see that all the time.
[00:35:23.929 --> 00:35:26.389]  No, I just said, live on air, and the crew didn't know I was calling for this.
[00:35:26.469 --> 00:35:31.929]  I said, yeah, he was in Pennsylvania, November 3rd, and he talked about World War III. They found a shorter clip.
[00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:36.730]  He talked about it two or three times in the speech.
[00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:43.829]  Because I was watching the speech here, getting ready in my office, and I don't normally have time to watch him live.
[00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.250]  I mean, I watched like an hour and a half of it.
[00:35:46.409 --> 00:35:47.590]  I watched the whole thing.
[00:35:49.949 --> 00:35:56.710]  Drinking coffee, and Topo Chico, and reading the news, and getting ready for an emergency show I did.
[00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.449]  I used to always do a show on Sundays.
[00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:00.449]  That was an emergency show.
[00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:06.090]  And he also said, hey, we're going to win in a landslide, but they're trying to steal it right now, so we got big issues.
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:17.820]  So we're going to play a short clip of that because this is, to my knowledge, the last time.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.179]  That was November 3rd.
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.480]  It's now November 27th.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:34.599]  So 24 days ago is the last time he talked about the dangers of World War III. And now, since he got elected, as we predicted, the system is trying to give him a full war and give us a full war.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:35.800]  So...
[00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:40.409]  What is he waiting for?
[00:36:41.469 --> 00:36:58.289]  And yeah, I'm trying to put pressure on the people around him and on Trump, because I don't think, I know it's a no-brainer, and it will only help, and the world is waiting for him, and the world wanted him in, there's some statistics in polls all over the world,
[00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:01.530]  to stop World War III. So that is his main...
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:11.320]  Mandate, and that's why we drafted him, and that's why we commissioned him, and that's why we put him in there, despite all the bullying and attack we all went through.
[00:37:16.099 --> 00:37:16.980]  So there you go.
[00:37:17.139 --> 00:37:23.400]  Here's the last time I heard him talk about the dangers of World War III. But I will prevent World War III. I know them all.
[00:37:23.519 --> 00:37:25.639]  We're very close to a world war right now.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:31.440]  With these people that we have, these low IQ people that we have right now, we don't even know who it is.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:36.039]  So, Putin, he's probably saying to himself, who the hell's running that place?
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.480]  It's like, you know, it's the United States of America.
[00:37:39.559 --> 00:37:43.619]  We have other countries saying, who the hell is running the United States of America?
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:44.800]  Does anybody know?
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:45.840]  Who do we speak to?
[00:37:46.719 --> 00:37:47.900]  I don't think you...
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:49.519]  He just said Obama.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.320]  That's right.
[00:37:51.099 --> 00:37:56.420]  No, I don't give Obama that much credit, actually, because I don't think it's Obama.
[00:37:57.119 --> 00:37:58.639]  No, Obama likes to play golf.
[00:37:58.719 --> 00:38:00.500]  He plays more golf than any human being.
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:02.920]  It's Blinken.
[00:38:04.539 --> 00:38:05.500]  They admit it.
[00:38:06.039 --> 00:38:09.400]  And Blackrock and the Rothschilds above that, literally.
[00:38:10.099 --> 00:38:14.039]  So I'll put that back at Trump in a loving criticism.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.079]  Who the hell is running the country?
[00:38:17.159 --> 00:38:18.139]  Well, we know it's not Harris.
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:19.039]  We know it's not Biden.
[00:38:19.179 --> 00:38:19.900]  We know it's the deep state.
[00:38:20.039 --> 00:38:21.260]  We know what they're doing is unpopular.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.760]  Over 80% of people in America and around the world, the polls are all the same, don't want this war.
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:27.340]  Don't want to pay for it.
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:27.960]  Don't want to die.
[00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:29.360]  Don't want to be drafted into it.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:36.199]  All these governments preparing drafts, military conscription, including here in the U.S., for women as well.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:40.159]  The Democrats are unanimous in the Senate wanting to pass a law to do it.
[00:38:41.139 --> 00:38:42.539]  Selective service for women.
[00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:46.349]  Oh yeah, you're getting your equal rights, aren't you?
[00:38:46.389 --> 00:38:47.550]  That's not a right you don't want.
[00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:53.289]  So, to be made to go fight.
[00:38:55.809 --> 00:38:57.469]  So, Trump's like, who the hell's running it?
[00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:58.030]  Well, we...
[00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:00.610]  Well, I mean, it's supposedly you.
[00:39:00.849 --> 00:39:02.010]  You have the mandate.
[00:39:02.469 --> 00:39:04.690]  President-elects get the national security briefings.
[00:39:04.769 --> 00:39:05.550]  It's on record.
[00:39:05.769 --> 00:39:06.750]  Totally legal, awful.
[00:39:06.909 --> 00:39:08.050]  They talk to world leaders.
[00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:09.050]  He's doing that.
[00:39:09.949 --> 00:39:14.650]  Why would, and Russia for weeks has been saying, we're ready to talk to Trump.
[00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:15.409]  We want him to lead it.
[00:39:15.449 --> 00:39:16.210]  We need to hear from him.
[00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:16.809]  We need to know.
[00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:23.030]  And you know he's talking to him behind the scenes, so it just doesn't make sense.
[00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:24.989]  I cannot figure it out.
[00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:26.570]  I'm going to crowdsource this.
[00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:31.400]  I'm going to open the phones up next hour on this topic for first-time callers.
[00:39:34.719 --> 00:39:38.480]  Why isn't Trump issuing daily statements?
[00:39:38.719 --> 00:39:51.440]  I mean, the world would be totally focused on him, and in the spirit of stopping the escalation into total war, he could then add in his whole other agenda to it and unify people even more.
[00:39:51.519 --> 00:39:53.000]  I mean, this is the right thing to do.
[00:39:53.059 --> 00:39:54.079]  It's a political winner.
[00:39:57.779 --> 00:39:58.179]  Why?
[00:39:58.179 --> 00:40:01.920]  And I'll get into the latest developments in a moment, but let me play these clips.
[00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:08.559]  So these are the last official prepared of a teleprompter statements he made.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.840]  Let's go to the one on March 16th.
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:24.940]  Then we'll go to the one on February 22nd, 2023. So we are a year and a half out from the last official where he also, this is on his true social, he put out a transcript of it.
[00:40:26.369 --> 00:40:26.769]  Right here.
[00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:29.230]  So, it's official.
[00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:32.849]  It's not off the cuff like November 3rd in Pennsylvania.
[00:40:33.929 --> 00:40:34.369]  Alright?
[00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:39.889]  So, where is the updated statement?
[00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.090]  I just keep saying that.
[00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:42.610]  Where is the updated statement?
[00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:43.829]  Where is the updated statement?
[00:40:44.409 --> 00:40:48.150]  Because I got a lot of other interesting, important news, but none of it is as important as this.
[00:40:48.849 --> 00:40:55.570]  Oh, I got caravans turning back now that Trump will put that tariff on them and they're attacking his tariff plans that are absolutely needed.
[00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:56.489]  I'll explain all that.
[00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:02.230]  I mean, I got a lot of stuff I'm going to get to, but I'm at least going to cover this some into the next hour.
[00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:16.380]  And then I'm going to move on into the good news and You know, victories and a lot of positive stuff, which incentivizes the globalists to do a big cyber attack, cut off the power blaming on the Russians and create civil unrest and martial law in the next 53 days.
[00:41:16.519 --> 00:41:18.179]  I mean, that's one of their big pre-programmed attacks.
[00:41:18.539 --> 00:41:20.780]  We're just waiting with the sword of Damocles here.
[00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:23.900]  Big false flags, killing migrants and blaming Trump.
[00:41:26.619 --> 00:41:27.099]  So...
[00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:48.389]  We're in a very special moment where we can still win and are winning, but if we think the bad guys have just gone away and that they're not on the field and that they're not attacking us and scheming like a bunch of demons that they are, well then, you're suicidal.
[00:41:50.130 --> 00:42:00.210]  So, and the fact that we're so close to turning the tide and getting these just open psychos out of power, it doesn't mean there'll be some utopia or it's all going to be perfect.
[00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:02.070]  I'm not promising that, and you know that too.
[00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:16.710]  But we at least will have a chance, a fighting chance, with more good people in corporate and governmental cultural positions that want common sense and logic and prosperity and freedom.
[00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.230]  And who don't love Satan.
[00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:28.469]  But I mean, we got really the most disgusting people in charge around the world still right now.
[00:42:28.909 --> 00:42:32.750]  I mean, they are the worst, the worst, the worst, the worst, which Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:49.989]  You get some evil people in, they recruit more evil, then they start pushing out the good people, and then those evil people get pushed out by more evil people, and then even more scheming evil people come in, and then it's not like, it's a synthesis where you just get maximum evil very quickly.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:56.360]  And we've had for 60, 70 years, the worst, the worst being replaced with the new worst, the worst.
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:57.659]  And then somebody even worse.
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:05.440]  And the schemes and the evil get more complex because normal people don't know how to deal with it or imagine it's going on.
[00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:07.559]  And there's a reason this stuff's so complex and crazy.
[00:43:08.519 --> 00:43:10.840]  We're up against some really smart, bad people.
[00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:24.230]  So stop being naive, study what their plans are, then resist them at every point, promote people that are into justice and freedom, have courage, because giving in to pure evil is a guaranteed destruction.
[00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:27.489]  So have courage to save yourself.
[00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:29.730]  Have courage to be successful.
[00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:33.630]  It would take blind, mindless courage to just go along with this evil.
[00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:35.670]  I mean, I'm trying to explain that.
[00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:37.590]  It's really not courage to fight this.
[00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:38.510]  It's self-preservation.
[00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:39.869]  It's survival instinct.
[00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:40.909]  It's fighting instinct.
[00:43:42.639 --> 00:43:43.820]  All right, back to back these.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.760]  Play the one for March and play the one for February.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.000]  The last time, an official statement from Trump.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.139]  This is what we need, updated yesterday.
[00:43:52.179 --> 00:43:52.980]  Here it is.
[00:43:53.219 --> 00:43:59.840]  We have never been closer to World War III than we are today under Joe Biden.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:08.760]  A global conflict between nuclear armed powers would mean death and destruction on a scale unmatched in human history.
[00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:12.059]  It would be nuclear Armageddon.
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.760]  Nothing is more important than avoiding that nightmare.
[00:44:16.119 --> 00:44:19.519]  We will avoid it, but we need new leadership.
[00:44:20.119 --> 00:44:23.260]  Every day, this proxy battle in Ukraine continues.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.619]  We risk global war.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:35.800]  We must be absolutely clear that our objective is to immediately have a total secession of hostilities.
[00:44:36.099 --> 00:44:38.039]  All shooting has to stop.
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.159]  This is the central issue.
[00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:42.769]  We need peace without delay.
[00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:58.750]  In addition, there must also be a complete commitment to dismantling the entire globalist neocon establishment that is perpetually dragging us into endless wars, pretending to fight for freedom and democracy abroad.
[00:44:59.489 --> 00:45:07.650]  While they turn us into a third world country and a third world dictatorship right here at home.
[00:45:07.989 --> 00:45:22.510]  The State Department, the defense bureaucracy, the intelligence services, and all of the rest need to be completely overhauled And reconstituted to fire the deep staters and put America first.
[00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:25.809]  We have to put America first.
[00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:35.530]  Finally, we have to finish the process we began under my administration of fundamentally re-evaluating NATO's purpose and NATO's mission.
[00:45:35.809 --> 00:45:40.730]  Our foreign policy establishment keeps trying to pull the world into conflict.
[00:45:41.369 --> 00:45:47.710]  With a nuclear-armed Russia based on the lie that Russia represents our greatest threat.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:53.119]  But the greatest threat to Western civilization today is not Russia.
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:46:03.519]  It's probably, more than anything else, ourselves and some of the horrible, USA-hating people that represent us.
[00:46:03.719 --> 00:46:06.780]  It's the abolition of our national borders.
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:09.900]  It's the failure to police our own cities.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.019]  It's the destruction of the rule of law from within.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:21.579]  It's the collapse of the nuclear family and Fertility rates like nobody can believe is happening.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:30.760]  It's the Marxists who would have us become a godless nation worshiping at the altar of race and gender and environment.
[00:46:31.139 --> 00:46:39.059]  And it's the globalist class that has made us totally dependent on China and other foreign countries that basically hate us.
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:54.699]  These globalists want to squander all of America's strength, blood, and treasure, chasing monsters and phantoms overseas while keeping us distracted from the havoc they're creating right here at home.
[00:46:54.940 --> 00:47:00.539]  These forces are doing more damage to America than Russia and China could ever have dreamed.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:07.539]  Evicting this sick and corrupt establishment is the monumental task for the next president.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.860]  And I am the only one who can do it.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.920]  I'm the only one that can get the job done.
[00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:14.000]  I know exactly what has to be done.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:22.659]  All right, we're gonna go to his other statement in months before that in February of last year, but this just broke in the last hour.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.079]  I just learned of it.
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:26.659]  It's happening.
[00:47:27.989 --> 00:47:28.929]  Looks like today.
[00:47:29.409 --> 00:47:31.610]  Wow, you couldn't script this.
[00:47:32.909 --> 00:47:36.369]  Ex-General Keith Kellogg eyed for key role in Ukraine.
[00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:37.389]  Peace strategy.
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.840]  Trump considering retired General Keith Kellogg for Ukraine.
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:43.659]  Envoy, that was hours ago.
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:44.820]  This just came out.
[00:47:45.539 --> 00:47:51.380]  Trump is nominating General Keith Kellogg to serve as assistant to the president and special envoy for Ukraine and Russia.
[00:47:51.599 --> 00:47:58.480]  He has led an distinguished military and business career, including serving in highly sensitive national security roles in my first administration.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.079]  He was with me right from the beginning.
[00:48:01.239 --> 00:48:05.239]  Together, we will secure peace through strength and make America and the whole world safe again.
[00:48:05.639 --> 00:48:07.559]  Okay, that's good news.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:15.300]  Other diplomats around the world are also calling for a de-escalation right now.
[00:48:15.719 --> 00:48:18.739]  So, I said I wanted to see something big today.
[00:48:18.739 --> 00:48:20.059]  He's lining up his team.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.519]  He's behind the scenes on the phone.
[00:48:23.639 --> 00:48:28.519]  And I get he wants to have a plan right away when he announces it.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.599]  The globalists know that, so they're wanting to get it completely escalated out of control.
[00:48:32.719 --> 00:48:41.260]  Before then, that's why he needs to talk about and call for global peace, call for as he's fired, demand it, and then say he's developing a plan and been talking to world leaders.
[00:48:42.579 --> 00:48:44.219]  Okay, I think that's a no-brainer.
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:45.480]  I don't think anybody can disagree with me.
[00:48:46.019 --> 00:48:50.940]  Russia warns U.S. against spiral of escalation but says it will keep channels open.
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:51.739]  Reuters.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.960]  Can we stop the cycle of escalation in Ukraine?
[00:48:55.239 --> 00:48:55.820]  New Yorker.
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.820]  Russia accelerates advances in Ukraine to the highest level since the war began.
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.579]  Key Trump pick calls for end of escalation in Ukraine.
[00:49:03.719 --> 00:49:05.059]  Representative Mike Waltz, Florida.
[00:49:06.739 --> 00:49:09.019]  British MP calls for halt to Ukraine escalation.
[00:49:09.599 --> 00:49:12.260]  EU state cautions against sending troops to Ukraine.
[00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:14.119]  Estonia.
[00:49:14.599 --> 00:49:17.599]  Thousands protest NATO chiefs' visit to bloc member states.
[00:49:18.639 --> 00:49:20.619]  Russia central bank halts U.S. dollar purchases.
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:25.500]  White House pressing Ukraine to draft 18-year-old men to help fill manpower needs in Russian battle.
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.219]  And it goes on from there.
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.519]  So, we're seeing some decent signs there.
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.500]  We'll cover it all in the next hour.
[00:49:37.489 --> 00:49:49.409]  Absolutely vital information and continue to discuss how we stop this out-of-control conflagration.

[00:51:30.369 --> 00:51:37.610]  Well, the winner, Chris DeLaro, is here in studio from New Jersey, former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:38.730]  What an amazing aircraft.
[00:51:38.989 --> 00:51:40.389]  Chris, I got to say, man, we love you.
[00:51:40.469 --> 00:51:41.190]  Thanks for the support.
[00:51:41.929 --> 00:51:42.730]  I love you, Alex.
[00:51:42.909 --> 00:51:45.010]  I love Bigley, Nate, Colin.
[00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.630]  Thanks, Chris.
[00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:50.809]  This is one of the pinnacles in my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there, just being in this studio.
[00:51:50.809 --> 00:51:52.010]  I never imagined I'd be here.
[00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:52.969]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:53.650]  You're the reason we're here.
[00:51:53.909 --> 00:51:56.210]  It's so cool how cool the listeners are.
[00:51:56.289 --> 00:51:56.690]  It is.
[00:51:57.050 --> 00:51:57.170]  Yes.
[00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.849]  Oh, thank you.
[00:51:58.110 --> 00:51:59.170]  The listeners are amazing.
[00:51:59.409 --> 00:52:05.170]  Like, everyone that goes to the Alex Jones store, obviously you're in it to win this truck, but this experience of coming on the show, how is this, Chris?
[00:52:05.329 --> 00:52:09.030]  I mean, is this not, this is like a, it's a dream, I would feel like, for the winner, right?
[00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:20.429]  Fortunately, I slept pretty good last night, but it's been very stressful because he said, Colin said, you're going on the show, and I was like, I'm a little camera shy, but here I am.
[00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:21.730]  And I've done well, Lord Vader.
[00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:25.110]  I said, I'll do whatever I need to do to help Alex and Bigley.
[00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:26.949]  Well, I'm glad I got to meet you.
[00:52:26.989 --> 00:52:28.809]  We're going to eat some barbecue from Terry Black's here in a minute.
[00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:30.530]  I'm starting to mouthwater when you said that.
[00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:31.130]  Oh, I'm starving.
[00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:32.489]  Now, real quick.
[00:52:33.019 --> 00:52:35.260]  This is all done by a computer, by a professional company.
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:36.579]  I was talking to you guys before.
[00:52:37.059 --> 00:52:38.480]  Sometimes it's in the middle of it.
[00:52:38.539 --> 00:52:39.340]  Sometimes it's at the end.
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:40.320]  Sometimes it's at the start.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.539]  Have you seen where somebody who entered on the first day won?
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:49.500]  You know, honestly, we've done probably 30 of these giveaways and have never seen someone win on the very first day.
[00:52:49.699 --> 00:52:55.340]  But we have these multipliers that go into place maybe at the first week and the last week of the giveaway, right?
[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:58.659]  And during these multipliers, if you spend $10, you get 100 entries.
[00:52:58.739 --> 00:53:00.739]  If you spend $100, you get 1,000 entries, right?
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:03.420]  It's a 10x multiplier for when you enter during that time period.
[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:06.280]  You actually entered during the 10x time period, right?
[00:53:06.559 --> 00:53:09.260]  And at the end of the giveaway, we run the 10x time period as well.
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.800]  So it was one of the best times to enter to win.
[00:53:12.059 --> 00:53:14.880]  And, I mean, you got, you know, more entries for how much you spent.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.380]  With the new contest, where are we right now?
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.800]  It's a brand new Ford F-250 Super Duty trimmer.
[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:20.420]  It's sick.
[00:53:20.519 --> 00:53:21.800]  It's all black, jacked up.
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:23.760]  It's Alex Jones verified for sure.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:24.980]  He picked the wheels.
[00:53:25.119 --> 00:53:25.840]  He picked the tires.
[00:53:26.099 --> 00:53:26.860]  It looks good.
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:27.260]  I don't know.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:28.340]  Yeah, we're showing it right here.
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:31.300]  It also comes with $10,000 in cash as well.
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:32.280]  Chris, do you have that on you?
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.019]  Yeah, this is not a hoax, people.
[00:53:47.219 --> 00:53:48.179]  Somebody can be like Chris.

[00:54:02.059 --> 00:54:02.920]  You get to meet Alex.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:03.679]  You get to be on the show.
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:06.179]  If you just enter your email, you're still entered to win.

[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:14.900]  You'll be very excited.
[00:54:15.079 --> 00:54:19.460]  I knew folks would love the last truck, and I know you'll love this truck as well.
[00:54:19.699 --> 00:54:25.340]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[00:54:25.519 --> 00:54:31.039]  It's a beautiful truck, super high ratings, and you get $10,000 in cash on top of it.
[00:54:31.219 --> 00:54:47.139]  For the lucky winner, a 2024 Ford F-250 Super Duty Diesel Tremor Edition, 6.7 liter high output power stroke diesel engine with 500 horsepower and 1,200 lb-ft per torque, 2-inch ready lift kit,
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:56.380]  37-inch Toyo off-road tires, 20-inch black Rhino wheels, 12-inch touchscreen with 360-degree cameras to see all around the truck.
[00:54:56.989 --> 00:54:58.269]  Well, it's a kick-ass truck.
[00:54:58.469 --> 00:55:00.670]  I'm sorry to see it go, but it's going to a great guy, Chris.
[00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:02.010]  Chris, love you, brother.
[00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:02.789]  Love you, man.
[00:55:02.849 --> 00:55:03.130]  Thank you.
[00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:05.530]  Somebody's about to get this sweetheart right here.
[00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:08.989]  And listen, they said I could drive it while I was down here for the last month and a half.
[00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:09.949]  I only drove it once.
[00:55:10.329 --> 00:55:11.269]  Things are too nice.
[00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:13.469]  The winners are going to get these pristine trucks.
[00:55:13.929 --> 00:55:16.190]  So, we'll see you at thealexhillstour.com, and thanks for all your support.
[00:55:28.739 --> 00:55:32.400]  Alright, I am going to open the phones up in the next segment.
[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:37.519]  I'm going to go intersperse all the other insanely important news throughout the next three hours.
[00:55:37.519 --> 00:55:41.619]  We've already completed our number one on this Wednesday, November 27, 2024 transmission.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:50.019]  We've been waiting for movement from Trump on proposing peace and using his incredible once-in-a-lifetime bully pulpit.
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:58.730]  We have not had statements that are official since 2020. March of last year, he's made brief comments on the campaign trail.
[00:55:58.889 --> 00:56:01.610]  The last one I know of was on November 3rd in Pennsylvania.
[00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:11.929]  So I want to play that clip one more time and then play another clip that hasn't gone viral since then that was on Truth Social of him in February laying out his peace plan.
[00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:14.989]  Well, he's in charge now as president-elect of the bully pulpit.
[00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:18.929]  And so, we really need to see a statement today.
[00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:20.769]  I understand he's got his envoy ready.
[00:56:20.909 --> 00:56:21.650]  He's nominated him.
[00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:23.630]  Can't wait till he gets confirmed.
[00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:24.969]  You gotta go now.
[00:56:25.269 --> 00:56:28.510]  The globalists know every hour is like a month right now.
[00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:29.250]  Here are the clips.
[00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:32.849]  But I will prevent World War III. I know them all.
[00:56:32.969 --> 00:56:35.090]  We're very close to a world war right now.
[00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:40.889]  With these people that we have, these low IQ people that we have right now, we don't even know who it is.
[00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:45.510]  So, Putin, he's probably saying to himself, who the hell's running that place?
[00:56:46.469 --> 00:56:48.929]  It's like, you know, it's the United States of America.
[00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:53.070]  We have other countries saying, who the hell is running the United States of America?
[00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:54.269]  Does anybody know?
[00:56:54.429 --> 00:56:55.289]  Who do we speak to?
[00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:57.349]  I don't think you...
[00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:58.969]  He just said Obama.
[00:56:59.230 --> 00:56:59.769]  That's right.
[00:57:00.889 --> 00:57:05.869]  No, I don't give Obama that much credit, actually, because I don't think it's Obama.
[00:57:06.590 --> 00:57:08.090]  No, Obama likes to play golf.
[00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:09.909]  He plays more golf than any human being.
[00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:13.309]  World War III has never been closer than it is right now.
[00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:25.489]  We need to clean house of all of the warmongers and America's last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the National Security Industrial Complex.
[00:57:26.039 --> 00:57:43.599]  One of the reasons I was the only president in generations who didn't start a war is that I was the only president who rejected the catastrophic advice of many of Washington's generals, bureaucrats, and the so-called diplomats who only know how to get us into conflict,
[00:57:43.599 --> 00:57:45.739]  but they don't know how to get us out.
[00:57:46.269 --> 00:58:01.369]  For decades, we've had the very same people such as Victoria Nuland and many others just like are obsessed with pushing Ukraine toward NATO, not to mention the State Department support for uprisings in Ukraine.
[00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:07.809]  These people have been seeking confrontation for a long time, much like the case in Iraq.
[00:58:08.429 --> 00:58:18.309]  And other parts of the world, and now we're teetering on the brink of World War III. And a lot of people don't see it, but I see it, and I've been right about a lot of things.
[00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:20.829]  They all say Trump's been right about everything.
[00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:33.769]  None of this excuses in any way the outrageous and horrible invasion of Ukraine one year ago, which would have never happened if I was your president, not even a little chance.
[00:58:34.489 --> 00:58:45.369]  But it does mean that here in America, we need to get rid of the corrupt globalist establishment that has botched every major foreign policy decision for decades.
[00:58:45.469 --> 00:58:56.570]  And that includes President Biden, whose own people said he's never made a good decision when it comes to looking at other countries and looking at wars.
[00:58:56.570 --> 00:59:00.940]  We have to replace them with People who support American interests.
[00:59:01.219 --> 00:59:11.480]  Over our four years in the White House, we made incredible progress in putting the America last contingent aside and bringing the world to peace.
[00:59:11.719 --> 00:59:14.820]  And now we're going to complete the mission.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:22.480]  The State Department, Pentagon and National Security Establishment We'll be a very different place by the end of my administration.
[00:59:23.079 --> 00:59:31.679]  In fact, just into my administration, it'll be a very different place and it'll get things done just like I did four years ago.
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:33.539]  We never had it so good.
[00:59:33.699 --> 00:59:49.710]  We'll also stop the lobbyists and the big defense contractors from going in and pushing our senior military and national security officials toward conflict only to reward them When they retire with lucrative jobs,
[00:59:49.909 --> 00:59:57.190]  getting paid millions and millions of dollars, take a look at the globalist warmonger donors backing our opponents.
[00:59:57.530 --> 01:00:00.269]  That's because they're candidates of war.
[01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:05.469]  I am the president who delivers peace, and it's peace through strength.
[01:00:05.789 --> 01:00:06.989]  Born to be wild.
[01:00:07.469 --> 01:00:09.349]  I can fly so high.
[01:00:12.559 --> 01:00:17.280]  Born to be wild, not slaves of Larry Fink and the New World Order.
[01:00:17.719 --> 01:00:22.139]  Not slaves of the lawfare and the Democratic pedophile party.
[01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:45.170]  They believe there are masters and owners, and they're finding out right now that we are involved in a psychological, cultural, spiritual, economic, innovative exodus Out of their system that they bet on.
[01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:47.409]  All right.
[01:00:50.829 --> 01:01:01.070]  President Trump, since November 3rd, has not made a statement about the escalations in World War III. That's 24 days ago.
[01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:13.349]  It has come out that he is doing behind-the-scenes detente with the head of NATO, Root, and that he's been on the phone with Putin and on the phone with Zelensky.
[01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:29.389]  And now he has nominated officially an official peace envoy, General Keith Kellogg, who's got a great record in his anti-World War III. So that's good.
[01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:31.309]  That's today.
[01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:39.849]  That's the first public action we've seen in 24 days.
[01:01:41.309 --> 01:01:54.530]  So, if you listen to the statements he last officially made, and I've already played one of them and part of the other, from March 16th, 2023...
[01:01:58.289 --> 01:02:10.250]  And February 22nd, 2023, on his Truth Social, and the written statements there and the video versions of that, he says, it's imminent.
[01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:11.250]  It's dangerous.
[01:02:11.489 --> 01:02:12.230]  It's out of control.
[01:02:12.429 --> 01:02:14.110]  These globalists are the worst managers ever.
[01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:15.130]  They're going to get us all killed.
[01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:36.579]  And he was right then, and he's right now to say it and not wait until Kellogg gets approval or whatever.
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:38.280]  He needs to go now.
[01:02:38.639 --> 01:02:41.880]  And other U.S. presidents have done that as soon as the president-elect before.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.159]  It's not just legal and lawful, it's Trump's responsibility.
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.280]  So I've been harping on this for an hour.
[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.260]  I know I'm right.
[01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:52.969]  I don't see any reason I'm wrong.
[01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:55.489]  If you can explain to me, I'm ready to hear it.
[01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:58.849]  And then I want to crowdsource, because I really respect your angles and views.
[01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:04.130]  Why do you think Trump has been silent for 24 days?
[01:03:09.449 --> 01:03:16.869]  Toll-free number to join us on the giant World War III topic today.
[01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:20.849]  Biden's saying he wants to give nukes to Ukraine.
[01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:38.170]  France says they're going to start bombing with heavy missiles as well, joining the UK and the US. The head of the NATO committee, Bauer, Admiral Bauer, saying maybe we should sneak attack Russia and putting it out as a policy question,
[01:03:39.050 --> 01:03:47.210]  trying to escalate, trying to provocate, poking the bear with a cattle prod.
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:51.179]  Hitting the bear in the face with a baseball bat.
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.460]  Hitting the beehive with a baseball bat.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:14.090]  Be like pulling up at some park and going to a black barbecue and start screaming the N-word at them and Slapping their wives upside the head.
[01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:15.389]  You probably get your ass kicked.
[01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:17.550]  Anybody else's barbecue for that matter.
[01:04:17.989 --> 01:04:19.329]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:04:21.929 --> 01:04:29.449]  And now NATO's come out in the New York Times and said, well, yo, Trump's going to have peace, so we want to go ahead and win the war for Ukraine now before he gets in.
[01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:34.590]  The mandate was against your World War III. You're not going to...
[01:04:38.089 --> 01:04:43.510]  Win the war, unless you call winning it blowing Russia off the map, and they'll blow us off the map.
[01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:44.769]  So there's no winning that.
[01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:46.409]  What a strange game.
[01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:47.989]  The only way to win is not to play.
[01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:55.030]  Russia warns U.S. against spiral escalation, but says it will keep channels open.
[01:04:56.530 --> 01:04:58.769]  What can stop the cycle of escalation in Ukraine?
[01:04:58.969 --> 01:05:02.050]  Well, I'm glad the folks at the New Yorker, the liberals, suddenly don't want to die.
[01:05:03.019 --> 01:05:05.199]  Russia accelerates advance in Ukraine.
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:11.739]  Reuters, Moscow, Russian forces are advancing in Ukraine at the fastest rate since the early days of the 2022 invasion.
[01:05:13.119 --> 01:05:23.719]  Taking an area half the size of London over the past month, analysts and war bloggers said today, Russian troops swept through swaths of Ukraine.
[01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:35.590]  We're good to go.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:46.739]  Could be its most dangerous phase.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:55.179]  The Russian report to be using North Korean troops in Ukraine and Kiev is now using Western-supplied missiles to strike back inside Moscow, inside Russia.
[01:05:55.719 --> 01:06:10.440]  Moscow, which like North Korea, has not confirmed or denied the presence of the troops, used a hypersonic intermediate-range missile on Ukraine last month and Ukraine reported the biggest Russian drone attack on its territory so far on Tuesday.
[01:06:11.409 --> 01:06:17.610]  Russia has set new weekly and monthly records for the size of the occupied territory in Ukraine.
[01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:20.570]  Independent Russian news groups reported.
[01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:28.530]  Notice, you got the head of Politico saying, no one that says they're a blogger or doesn't work for corporate media is a real journalist.
[01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:32.610]  Really, is that why Reuters quoting the war bloggers on the ground there?
[01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:34.550]  No, they're the real journalists, not even Reuters.
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:39.699]  Key Trump pick calls to end escalation in Ukraine.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.920]  Representative Mike Walz of Florida.
[01:06:42.659 --> 01:06:43.219]  Walz.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:44.960]  Not Walz.
[01:06:45.119 --> 01:06:46.039]  Not Tampon Tim.
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:54.880]  U.S. President-elect Trump's top security advisor called Sunday for an end to the escalation on the war between Ukraine and Russia and for both parties to come to the negotiating table.
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:58.380]  We need to bring this to a responsible end.
[01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:04.909]  We need to remove, restore deterrence, restore peace, and get ahead of this escalation ladder.
[01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:08.429]  Oh, what I keep telling you about, escalation ladders.
[01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:18.929]  That responding to it, again, we need to bring this to a responsible end.
[01:07:19.929 --> 01:07:26.869]  We need to restore deterrence, restore peace, and get ahead of this escalation ladder.
[01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:29.889]  That goes to World War III and nuclear war.
[01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:39.650]  Then responding to it, yes, said Mike Waltz, Trump's pick for the influential role of U.S. National Security Advisor.
[01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:43.730]  And a lot of others calling for peace.
[01:07:43.929 --> 01:07:47.190]  So, that's good.
[01:07:47.949 --> 01:07:52.610]  And him nominating Kellogg to be the peace envoy is very good.
[01:07:57.389 --> 01:07:59.750]  But we need to hear from Trump.
[01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:03.309]  Just call for de-escalation, call for peace.
[01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:08.789]  He needs to attack the neocons that are controlling the Democratic Party's foreign policy.
[01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:17.430]  He needs to say it's insane for NATO to be talking about launching preemptive or sneak attacks on Russia.
[01:08:18.069 --> 01:08:21.170]  He needs to say, no, we don't want nuclear weapons in Ukraine.
[01:08:21.369 --> 01:08:24.590]  You already said no, and Zelensky was here a few months ago saying, if you get elected, I want them.
[01:08:25.619 --> 01:08:39.039]  He needs to come out and de-escalate so that the Russians don't escalate because the globalists are still in control and are continuing to try to get them to react.
[01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:41.039]  This is no-brainer.
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:42.760]  This is not even a question of this.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:47.220]  Here's the toll-free number to join us on the subjects I've laid out here.
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:50.220]  This one topic, please humor me.
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.680]  And after I take 10-15 calls on that subject, we'll move on to free-for-all.
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:09:07.859]  But the first round of calls, first-time callers, 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.420]  First-time callers, give folks a chance to have tried to get through, never got through, or never tried to get through today.
[01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:14.920]  We'd love to hear from you on this eve of Thanksgiving.
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.180]  I'd love to have a call for peace.
[01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:18.020]  I'd love...
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:24.180]  Maybe he does it on Thanksgiving, but General Flynn said it's a no-brainer.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.520]  He used to be his national security advisor.
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:30.619]  I guarantee if he asks Waltz this, Waltz will say the same thing.
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:33.199]  So, I know Trump, though.
[01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:35.800]  He wants to have the ceasefire.
[01:09:35.819 --> 01:09:39.840]  He wants Putin to propose it so he can come out and say it.
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:44.220]  And that's big.
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:44.840]  That's important.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.300]  But he can call and call for it and demand it.
[01:09:49.569 --> 01:09:50.970]  And then when it happens, it's even bigger.
[01:09:52.109 --> 01:09:54.750]  But I'm really trying to stop the big event, nuclear war.
[01:09:54.909 --> 01:09:56.130]  I know you want that as well.
[01:09:57.130 --> 01:10:02.050]  There's probably not many people that are that nihilistic that they do want it.
[01:10:02.789 --> 01:10:05.409]  877-789-2539.
[01:10:05.989 --> 01:10:09.510]  877-789-ALEX. Okay.
[01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:12.170]  I have covered that.
[01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:18.229]  But I wanted to finish up the clip, we didn't get to it all last segment, of the February time.
[01:10:19.609 --> 01:10:21.649]  Where he just states all this common sense stuff.
[01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:23.489]  You know, it started at the beginning because I only played half of it.
[01:10:27.119 --> 01:10:34.600]  Start at the beginning, because man, I was running around the control room and printing articles and giving orders and stuff while this was playing, and I'd seen it before.
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:37.100]  But I was like, man, that's really good what he said.
[01:10:37.119 --> 01:10:38.119]  That was really powerful.
[01:10:38.239 --> 01:10:39.100]  That was really dead on.
[01:10:39.199 --> 01:10:40.640]  Oh my God, that's so good.
[01:10:40.899 --> 01:10:42.020]  That's so accurate.
[01:10:42.579 --> 01:10:44.739]  And there's a lot to unpack from this clip.
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:49.539]  So let's play, because the March clip that we...
[01:10:50.489 --> 01:10:52.390]  Resurfaced last week that went super viral.
[01:10:52.649 --> 01:11:00.869]  That was powerful, but his February clip was even more powerful, repudiating the bad guys doing all of this.
[01:11:01.710 --> 01:11:09.010]  So let's play that, and then I'll get into all the other news and start taking your phone calls.
[01:11:09.010 --> 01:11:09.390]  Here it is.
[01:11:16.119 --> 01:11:19.399]  World War III has never been closer than it is right now.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:31.579]  We need to clean house of all of the warmongers and America's last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the National Security Industrial Complex.
[01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:49.710]  One of the reasons I was the only president in generations who didn't start a war is that I was the only president who rejected the catastrophic advice of many of Washington's generals, bureaucrats, and the so-called diplomats who only know how to get us into conflict,
[01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:51.850]  but they don't know how to get us out.
[01:11:52.390 --> 01:12:07.510]  For decades, we've had the very same people such as Victoria Nuland and many others just like are obsessed with pushing Ukraine toward NATO, not to mention the State Department support for uprisings in Ukraine.
[01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:13.890]  These people have been seeking confrontation for a long time, much like the case in Iraq.
[01:12:14.529 --> 01:12:24.409]  And other parts of the world, and now we're teetering on the brink of World War III. And a lot of people don't see it, but I see it, and I've been right about a lot of things.
[01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:26.930]  They all say Trump's been right about everything.
[01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:39.869]  None of this excuses in any way the outrageous and horrible invasion of Ukraine one year ago, which would have never happened if I was your president, not even a little chance.
[01:12:40.579 --> 01:12:51.460]  But it does mean that here in America, we need to get rid of the corrupt globalist establishment that has botched every major foreign policy decision for decades.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:13:02.659]  And that includes President Biden, whose own people said he's never made a good decision when it comes to looking at other countries and looking at wars.
[01:13:02.659 --> 01:13:07.090]  We have to replace them with People who support American interests.
[01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:17.590]  Over our four years in the White House, we made incredible progress in putting the America last contingent aside and bringing the world to peace.
[01:13:17.789 --> 01:13:20.930]  And now we're going to complete the mission.
[01:13:21.109 --> 01:13:28.569]  The State Department, Pentagon and National Security Establishment We'll be a very different place by the end of my administration.
[01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:37.789]  In fact, just into my administration, it'll be a very different place, and it'll get things done, just like I did four years ago.
[01:13:38.069 --> 01:13:39.649]  We never had it so good.
[01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:55.819]  We'll also stop the lobbyists and the big defense contractors from going in and pushing our senior military and national security officials toward conflict, only to reward them When they retire with lucrative jobs,
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:03.300]  getting paid millions and millions of dollars, take a look at the globalist warmonger donors backing our opponents.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.380]  That's because they're candidates of war.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:11.539]  I am the president who delivers peace, and it's peace through strength.
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.260]  There was a reason we had no conflict.
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:18.840]  There was a reason we didn't get into wars, because other countries respected us.
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:23.579]  I entirely built All right from the beginning, rebuilt our military.
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.539]  It's a big reason for that.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:29.819]  They didn't want to mess around with the United States, and now they're laughing at us.
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:34.199]  We could end the Ukraine conflict in 24 hours with the right leadership.
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:42.520]  At the end of my next four years, the warmongers and frauds and failures of the senior ranks of our government will all be gone.
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:51.399]  And we will have a new group of competent national security officials who believe in defending America's vital interests above all else.
[01:14:51.579 --> 01:14:52.800]  Thank you very much.
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:01.880]  You know, we put out his March statement last week, and it got over 130 million views.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.579]  I knew about this other statement.
[01:15:05.699 --> 01:15:06.500]  Why the hell did I get that?
[01:15:06.579 --> 01:15:07.579]  That's even more powerful.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.220]  That's like five times more powerful.
[01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:11.949]  I mean, that is historic, what you just heard.
[01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:13.329]  I mean, I wrote a bunch of notes here.
[01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:17.329]  We'll end the war by cutting off the fighting in 24 hours.
[01:15:19.149 --> 01:15:22.010]  We'll fire the deep state that only know how to get us into wars.
[01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:26.989]  We're on the brink of World War III, then and now even worse.
[01:15:30.329 --> 01:15:31.409]  Peace through strength.
[01:15:31.649 --> 01:15:33.350]  The world loving America again.
[01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:36.550]  I mean, that was strong.
[01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:37.649]  It was so true.
[01:15:37.810 --> 01:15:38.569]  It was perfect.
[01:15:40.399 --> 01:15:41.300]  We need that.
[01:15:42.739 --> 01:15:54.420]  And then he needs to go after the lame duck administration, point out that Kamala was installed, that Biden was disappeared, that the resignation letter was fake, that they're not even real.
[01:15:56.649 --> 01:16:05.010]  And that Blinken and those criminals need to be hauled up on criminal charges and the generals that went along with this stuff with court-martials when he gets in.
[01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:09.489]  And that's how you get on the offense and that's how you stop World War III. And let me show you how this ties together.
[01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:10.010]  Look at this.
[01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:10.729]  This is just today.
[01:16:12.090 --> 01:16:13.670]  Look at this letter from Tom Cotton.
[01:16:16.869 --> 01:16:22.949]  Tom Cotton sends a letter to Lloyd Austin, the Secretary of Defense, telling him to knock off the nonsense obstructing Trump.
[01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:24.130]  He literally says, please...
[01:16:25.359 --> 01:16:27.659]  Stop meaning in secret of how to stop Trump.
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.859]  Please stop setting up networks to block him.
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:31.859]  They're called stay behind networks.
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:33.199]  I got the letter right here.
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:34.380]  Please.
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.060]  Please.
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.600]  I want to go to your calls, but I need to read this too.
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:43.000]  And Please stop engaging in treason.
[01:16:43.279 --> 01:16:46.859]  And then you got CNN. Oh yeah, the Pentagon's meeting in secret to stop Trump.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:56.140]  And oh, we're not going to let any military bases or personnel or National Guard help deporting the illegals because that's an illegal order.
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:59.920]  And you've got senior Pentagon generals saying it's in legal order.
[01:17:00.079 --> 01:17:09.600]  It's in the damn Constitution that the federal government, one of its main three things, is controlling the borders and deporting illegals.
[01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:20.069]  So you got these generals that will do all this unconstitutional stuff, and you've got Biden executive orders and military manuals put out this year for martial law and killing citizens.
[01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.989]  That's illegal.
[01:17:22.529 --> 01:17:31.750]  And then you've got them saying, oh, when Trump gets in, he'll use the military, and they're telling mayors and people, oh, it's illegal, and mayors like in Denver are saying, well, we'll have the citizens fight you.
[01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:43.310]  That's a felony to stop a federal officer in the open, court-ordered Execution of the Constitution.
[01:17:46.409 --> 01:17:47.210]  It's insane.
[01:17:48.529 --> 01:17:53.029]  And now that mayor backed off, people are like, hey dude, that's illegal.
[01:17:54.029 --> 01:17:59.310]  But Tom Cotton slams partisans and obstructionists.
[01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:16.479]  Well, when you're in the military and you don't do what the commander-in-chief says, if it's constitutional, and then you say these are illegal orders that Trump in his transition is saying get ready for, The U.S. military can't go out and confiscate your guns,
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.680]  can't make you take shots, can't put you in quarantine camps in the Constitution.
[01:18:19.859 --> 01:18:22.359]  Though they got executive orders from past presidents to do it.
[01:18:23.899 --> 01:18:24.640]  Not Trump.
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:34.659]  But to say the military cannot aid with the border or aid with removing people, look what Eisenhower did with the military, the regular army.
[01:18:38.539 --> 01:18:39.640]  And his operation.
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:43.479]  So, they're already billing this as illegal.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.180]  You've got Newsom saying he'll fight it.
[01:18:45.279 --> 01:18:47.720]  You've got the governor of Massachusetts saying it.
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.220]  The New York governor, Hochul.
[01:18:52.819 --> 01:18:55.739]  Denver mayor responds that Trump's border czar threatening to arrest him.
[01:18:57.579 --> 01:18:59.939]  Well, I mean, he said he's going to physically block them.
[01:19:02.579 --> 01:19:09.000]  You got ICE with a warrant from a judge because the person didn't come to their immigration hearing five years ago, three years ago?
[01:19:11.359 --> 01:19:18.520]  I mean, you try with a duly sworn search warrant or arrest warrant with the feds and just, you know, run up and jump on them.
[01:19:18.579 --> 01:19:19.199]  See what happens.
[01:19:22.239 --> 01:19:26.079]  So, Trump talks about using the feds and the federal government for what they're supposed to do.
[01:19:26.199 --> 01:19:28.500]  They all lie and say to the public, it's Hitler!
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:29.359]  It's illegal!
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:33.840]  And then the Pentagon, I got the quotes right here, Fox News, and I got the letter.
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:38.159]  He quotes the public statements by generals saying...
[01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:41.409]  These are illegal orders.
[01:19:42.649 --> 01:19:50.409]  Frederick Mayer plans to use tax dollars, Fox News reports, for immigrant legal aid funds sparks debate.
[01:19:50.890 --> 01:19:58.909]  Oh, they're going to use taxpayer money to bring in the replacement migration for us and then use our tax money to try to keep these illegals here illegally.
[01:19:59.909 --> 01:20:01.890]  Just total globalist crap.
[01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:12.609]  Here's the DOD directive 5240.01 for the martial law put out by Biden in September, not by Trump.
[01:20:13.569 --> 01:20:16.829]  Member Harris said the military is coming to get you over and over again.
[01:20:17.729 --> 01:20:19.869]  Funny, migrant caravans not reaching border.
[01:20:20.029 --> 01:20:23.390]  Mexican president says that for Trump threats of a 25% tariff.
[01:20:26.949 --> 01:20:29.930]  So, good things are happening.
[01:20:31.710 --> 01:20:32.829]  Alright, we're going to go to break.
[01:20:34.989 --> 01:20:47.670]  I want to stay on the World War III topic, and I'll take 30 minutes of calls when we come back on this topic, then I'll get to a bunch of other news, but then continue on with that topic with the callers.
[01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:57.069]  We got really good news that I wanted to tell that is the essence of victory and soft power, completely legal and lawful.
[01:20:58.909 --> 01:21:00.869]  It's like knowing where to hit the Death Star.
[01:21:03.119 --> 01:21:10.699]  This is the way 11 GOP states sue Blackrock, State Street and Vanguard for conspiring to drive up energy costs.
[01:21:10.779 --> 01:21:11.760]  And it's happening all over the world.
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:12.979]  Massive news.
[01:21:15.659 --> 01:21:17.960]  And it ties into a bunch of other news I've got.
[01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:20.220]  Population collapse, you name it.
[01:21:20.539 --> 01:21:25.659]  All these documents coming out on DEI and how it's designed to destroy society.
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.060]  Well, of course it's designed to do it.
[01:21:27.479 --> 01:21:28.279]  Liberals are dumb.
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:31.399]  They keep being unpopular because they're trying to sort a race war.
[01:21:31.479 --> 01:21:32.100]  Why do they do that?
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:34.479]  It's called divide and conquer.
[01:21:36.159 --> 01:21:42.220]  And then we've got the globalist counter-strike to the EU and the UK and Australia and Brazil against Elon Musk and the American people.
[01:21:42.699 --> 01:21:43.779]  That's all coming up.
[01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:45.880]  We're only an hour and a half in, folks.
[01:21:46.199 --> 01:21:47.699]  We've got two and a half hours left.
[01:21:47.779 --> 01:21:48.520]  I'm hitting it all.
[01:21:48.939 --> 01:21:49.979]  You are the Paul Revere.
[01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:50.920]  Spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:21:51.789 --> 01:21:54.869]  Many years ago, I coined the term 360 win.
[01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:58.010]  That's another way of saying it's a non-zero sum game.
[01:21:58.229 --> 01:22:03.149]  When you have a sum game, it's a pizza, there's only so many pieces, it doesn't get bigger.
[01:22:03.369 --> 01:22:09.430]  But if something is symbiotic, if something empowers everybody involved with it, it is a 360 win.

[01:22:46.779 --> 01:23:07.600]  And for breaking news and updates, be sure and follow me at Real Alex Jones, here on X. It is beyond imperative that President Trump not wait to try to get a ceasefire and to come out and call for one and use his power to criticize the deep state trying to hand him a full-blown nuclear war before he gets into office,
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:15.199]  which they admitted in the New York Times this week they're doing with the talk of giving nuclear weapons to Ukraine.
[01:23:16.010 --> 01:23:18.170]  So I'm just restating that no-brainer right there.
[01:23:18.510 --> 01:23:20.569]  We're going to be going to your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:23:22.670 --> 01:23:27.930]  Then you've got the Pentagon and the New York Times and CNN and ABC News.
[01:23:28.069 --> 01:23:29.210]  Oh, the Pentagon are heroes.
[01:23:30.170 --> 01:23:36.630]  They're going to block Trump's illegal agenda to round up the illegal alien human smugglers and drug dealers.
[01:23:36.949 --> 01:23:40.710]  And the military leaders are saying they're not going to follow illegal orders.
[01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:44.930]  And they're going around the Pentagon saying, what are you going to do when he comes here with illegal orders?
[01:23:45.130 --> 01:24:00.539]  They're organizing a mutiny against constitutional duties of the federal government that The Biden administration didn't just not do their duty.
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:01.380]  They did the opposite.
[01:24:02.619 --> 01:24:11.619]  And said, when I win the election, he said, in the months before he stole it in 2020, I want you to immediately surge the border.
[01:24:15.039 --> 01:24:17.779]  And then 25 million people at least came in.
[01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:20.880]  It's not 325,000.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:21.739]  That's what they know of.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:25.100]  The government had certified and disappeared children.
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:26.840]  It's over a million.
[01:24:28.199 --> 01:24:39.439]  And then you've got the new head of ICE saying, well, okay, Mayor, you get in the way of us doing federal duty with warrants from judges, immigration judges, we'll arrest your ass.
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:40.819]  Oh, God, you're Hitler!
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:49.979]  And Helman says, no, that's the federal law.
[01:24:50.939 --> 01:24:52.819]  They're the ones that have been breaking the law.
[01:24:54.489 --> 01:25:02.189]  They're the ones that have been doing all this, telling people to come here, giving them UN money, giving them State Department money, having NGOs, being commanded the Border Patrol.
[01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:10.810]  That's all over January 20th, 2025. And then what did Biden do?
[01:25:10.930 --> 01:25:11.630]  He goes, you know what?
[01:25:11.710 --> 01:25:13.409]  We'll just legalize anybody that gets here.
[01:25:13.670 --> 01:25:16.050]  No more Border Patrol until January 20th.
[01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:17.270]  There's an app.
[01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:18.710]  You just use that and you're legal.
[01:25:18.930 --> 01:25:20.289]  They were already doing that.
[01:25:22.319 --> 01:25:27.260]  You just go on the app, say I'm coming through the app, don't need to go to the port of entry anymore.
[01:25:27.819 --> 01:25:38.779]  It sets you on average an immigration hearing in seven years, and when you show up at the port of entry, they have no power, the Border Patrol, they just have to let you in.
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:48.520]  That's the same thing when I've talked to high-level federal judges off the record, with law enforcement that are concerned in the last year.
[01:25:51.329 --> 01:25:52.430]  And they pointed me to this.
[01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:55.909]  I knew it, but I hadn't thought that under federal law, I need to change that.
[01:25:56.829 --> 01:26:07.069]  The head of the Justice Department, the Attorney General, can decide if judges and magistrates can charge an illegal for any crime.
[01:26:07.409 --> 01:26:07.930]  Rape?
[01:26:08.189 --> 01:26:08.710]  Murder?
[01:26:09.989 --> 01:26:11.270]  Child molestation?
[01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:12.010]  Child rape?
[01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.909]  Drug dealing?
[01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.949]  Arson?
[01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:15.130]  Attempted murder?
[01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:21.760]  And Merrick Garland will not let them charge them.
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:30.619]  But under federal law, they're allowed to keep them without his authorization for 30 days for crossing the border illegally, and that's all they've got.
[01:26:34.479 --> 01:26:37.600]  And the federal judges are like, Alex, you need to tell people this.
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:40.659]  You need to explain this.
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:42.260]  You need to...
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:43.479]  So...
[01:26:45.829 --> 01:26:47.409]  The feds are not all our enemies.
[01:26:47.409 --> 01:26:50.550]  They have been working under this criminal insanity.
[01:26:53.550 --> 01:26:57.310]  And we're going to get the bad guys out and put the good men and women in.
[01:26:58.510 --> 01:27:01.930]  Now, Department of Education, things like that, bye-bye.
[01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:05.770]  But this is a hijacking issue.
[01:27:06.010 --> 01:27:08.069]  Our government has been hijacked.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:09.880]  It's too big.
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:10.979]  It's out of control.
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:16.260]  They admit in studies, over 80% of federal workers since COVID never go back to work once a month.
[01:27:16.359 --> 01:27:17.100]  They don't do anything.
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:20.439]  And it's in county and state government as well.
[01:27:20.659 --> 01:27:26.859]  I had the gas broken on my gas system for three months.
[01:27:29.159 --> 01:27:34.979]  Runs, didn't need it because it wasn't cold then, but runs the stove, runs the water heaters, runs all sorts of stuff.
[01:27:36.850 --> 01:27:42.310]  And the city just kept saying, well, we'll send somebody out, call back in a week, we'll give you an appointment, go online.
[01:27:42.930 --> 01:27:45.069]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of phone calls.
[01:27:45.930 --> 01:27:47.970]  And three months later, they came and fixed the gas.
[01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:51.609]  And, you know, we'd call out over, and they'd say, sorry, we can't touch the gas meter.
[01:27:51.989 --> 01:27:53.750]  I'd say, I know, can't you come?
[01:27:54.130 --> 01:27:56.810]  I'm not a guy that starts bribing people unless I don't have energy.
[01:27:57.010 --> 01:27:59.210]  I'm kind of like, well, you can't just fix it.
[01:27:59.350 --> 01:28:00.449]  No, I can't touch that.
[01:28:03.829 --> 01:28:05.710]  They're like, we get these calls every hour.
[01:28:06.130 --> 01:28:09.390]  The city is just not coming out and fixing gas.
[01:28:10.529 --> 01:28:15.609]  And I go, I'm not going to call in a false report of smelling gas, but what do I got to do to get them to fix it?
[01:28:15.789 --> 01:28:17.810]  So I started going down there.
[01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:23.329]  Not my assistant and not my wife, who'd all been down there.
[01:28:23.970 --> 01:28:30.430]  Again, folks, the governments are so broken down, you can't get your gas meter fixed.
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:32.880]  In Austin, Texas.
[01:28:33.439 --> 01:28:35.600]  I mean, that's collapse-level crap.
[01:28:36.619 --> 01:28:42.640]  And that is emblematic at the bottom of what we have at the top of, oh, we haven't talked to Putin in almost three years.
[01:28:42.659 --> 01:28:47.560]  Oh, we don't even use the hotline, which is a big computer interface, you know, video, teleconference.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.420]  And the Russians go, yeah, no one talks to us.
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:52.420]  So...
[01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:17.449]  I had to call a company about a month into this and just say, okay, come in here, get in my garage, cut it into the lines, and put in a European electric heater that heats the water.
[01:29:17.649 --> 01:29:19.670]  You turn it on and wait five minutes for it to get hot.
[01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:28.789]  And it's just, it's absolutely insane.
[01:29:32.039 --> 01:29:36.020]  And then if you try to wait for a permit for somebody to come put it in, that'll never happen either.
[01:29:36.119 --> 01:29:36.979]  So you gotta like...
[01:29:36.979 --> 01:29:42.220]  So the government is asleep at the switch.
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:44.020]  It is totally insane at the top.
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:52.600]  And I got news clips about 80 plus percent of federal workers just do nothing.
[01:29:57.159 --> 01:30:04.319]  And then the dock workers that are making $25 an hour on average and living in these expensive cities, they can't ever get raises, so they go on strike.
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:07.340]  Things are falling apart.
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:09.680]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:30:10.479 --> 01:30:11.520]  It's just...
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:15.439]  It's mind-blowing.
[01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:19.239]  Absolutely mind-blowing.
[01:30:19.359 --> 01:30:20.859]  Oh, my gas pressure's down...
[01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:22.810]  Just call a company out.
[01:30:23.010 --> 01:30:25.489]  Yeah, you've got like 10% of the gas coming through.
[01:30:25.689 --> 01:30:27.970]  The meter's broken.
[01:30:28.289 --> 01:30:29.090]  Well, we'll fix it.
[01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.789]  I can't touch it.
[01:30:31.250 --> 01:30:33.470]  You go to this website, you call this number.
[01:30:33.689 --> 01:30:34.649]  Okay, go and call.
[01:30:35.449 --> 01:30:36.470]  Please leave your name.
[01:30:36.970 --> 01:30:38.029]  Please go online.
[01:30:38.170 --> 01:30:38.489]  Go online.
[01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:39.989]  No one ever calls for a week.
[01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:41.970]  Call back, call back, call back, call back.
[01:30:42.409 --> 01:30:43.489]  You go down in person.
[01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:45.050]  Doors are locked.
[01:30:45.130 --> 01:30:45.710]  Go down another day.
[01:30:45.869 --> 01:30:48.149]  Oh, we're open one day a week for these hours.
[01:30:48.250 --> 01:30:49.109]  You go sit in line.
[01:30:50.930 --> 01:30:53.170]  You finally go, hey, I need my gas thing.
[01:30:53.710 --> 01:30:55.149]  What's wrong with your gas?
[01:30:55.529 --> 01:30:56.369]  Let me check.
[01:30:56.529 --> 01:30:57.470]  I don't see it in here.
[01:30:59.729 --> 01:31:00.989]  Give me your number.
[01:31:01.149 --> 01:31:01.770]  We'll call you back.
[01:31:03.770 --> 01:31:05.010]  Nobody calls you back.
[01:31:06.689 --> 01:31:11.930]  Yeah, we need the Department of Government efficiency like 100 years ago.
[01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:19.010]  So these people are out of their minds.
[01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:28.109]  Oh my God, the new head of ICE said he'll arrest me, the mayor said.
[01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:39.210]  You said you're going to organize the public to physically stop the feds in one of their few duties they're supposed to do under the Constitution, 100% legal and lawful.
[01:31:39.729 --> 01:31:44.989]  You're going to physically attack them, and then the head of it says, listen, you better watch out, that's a felony.
[01:31:45.149 --> 01:31:47.590]  Oh my God, you're Hitler!
[01:31:49.039 --> 01:32:04.100]  No, you're the ones bringing in millions of people, most of them military-age men, robbing, raping, stealing, killing, burning, getting on welfare, sucking off the system, eating people's cats and dogs,
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:16.880]  end of the world, wrath of God type of stuff, 40 days of darkness, cats and dogs living together.
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:24.340]  Guys, when you get the Ghostbusters clip, God, I love those old movies that are funny.
[01:32:25.659 --> 01:32:27.079]  Why can't they make good movies today?
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:28.159]  And it's not just that I'm old.
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:29.859]  I mean, young people go, yeah, older movies are better.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.479]  Because Hollywood doesn't care.
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:32.840]  And the actors don't care.
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:33.539]  It's crap.
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:39.520]  But we can joke about this all day long.
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:40.359]  This is dangerous.
[01:32:44.119 --> 01:32:44.479]  So...
[01:32:46.810 --> 01:32:47.510]  Let's do this.
[01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:49.729]  I said I'd take calls for 30 minutes.
[01:32:49.869 --> 01:32:55.250]  I've already got another 10 or 15. We'll take calls until the bottom of the next hour.
[01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:56.630]  And then I'll continue with calls.
[01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:59.770]  But then I'm really prepared here.
[01:32:59.890 --> 01:33:01.310]  I'm mentioning stuff that's in the stack.
[01:33:02.689 --> 01:33:03.369]  It's insane.
[01:33:03.369 --> 01:33:07.489]  I get ready for like 8 hours at night during the morning and then I don't ever get to 10% of it.
[01:33:07.609 --> 01:33:08.550]  I've got to hit this.
[01:33:09.029 --> 01:33:10.350]  You hear me mentioning all this stuff?
[01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:11.850]  I have the videos of all of this.
[01:33:13.609 --> 01:33:19.210]  And man, you talk about the trans-globalist cult funded by BlackRock, the stuff they're up to, it's even more insane now.
[01:33:22.449 --> 01:33:25.789]  And we got the good news, too, how we cut off the money to these creatures.
[01:33:26.909 --> 01:33:28.829]  So, that's all coming up.
[01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:35.590]  But first, let me just take a break to talk about something very near and dear to my heart and the fight we've been through here.
[01:33:36.859 --> 01:33:54.659]  And the fact that if you don't back people that back you, I mean, the Democrats announced any lawyers around the country, they said this a month ago, that go and investigate election fraud, and anyone that's hired by Trump that goes and files any lawsuits in any county or city for,
[01:33:54.739 --> 01:34:03.399]  quote, election integrity, we're going to sue you, and we're going to have you disbarred by the legal bars that we control, almost all of them.
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:07.500]  Well, Trump found lawyers that weren't scared, went and did their job.
[01:34:07.699 --> 01:34:11.340]  The Democrats did all these suits, tried to block them being poll watchers and everything.
[01:34:11.699 --> 01:34:28.100]  But tens of thousands of lawyers, over $150 million spent, and when they tried to come in in Georgia and Pennsylvania and Michigan with the midnight trucks, with out-of-state license plates, with the Joe Biden ballots,
[01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:31.260]  there were the lawyers, and they literally turned around and went back.
[01:34:33.899 --> 01:34:35.939]  And the Democrats are, we're going to disbar every one of you.
[01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:36.340]  Well, good.
[01:34:36.619 --> 01:34:39.579]  Now you're dealing with tens of thousands of people that got balls.
[01:34:39.779 --> 01:34:41.260]  You can't get us all.
[01:34:41.819 --> 01:34:49.100]  But when somebody's targeted like Trump, or myself, or Elon Musk, who they're really coming after, I'll get to that next hour, you gotta back people.
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:56.439]  You know, I've heard all this bitching and complaining that Trump's put a few people in, like this idiot Surgeon General that's like a baby Fauci.
[01:34:56.539 --> 01:34:58.399]  Well, the Surgeon General has no power as advisory.
[01:34:59.630 --> 01:35:15.829]  The real people Trump's putting in, his head, the man to head of NIH, is this hardcore anti-globalist, anti-Big Pharma, says the whole thing's a fraud, the shots are deadly, it's all a psychological warfare operation, the New World Order's totally evil.
[01:35:19.359 --> 01:35:24.560]  And now he's got General Kellogg coming in, who's absolutely not a globalist World War III guy.
[01:35:25.079 --> 01:35:34.319]  I want to see as much enthusiasm about the good people Trump's putting in as the whining and flipping out and bitching about some of the bad people he's putting in.
[01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:36.000]  Just do that.
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:38.100]  And I got that stuff coming up.
[01:35:38.159 --> 01:35:40.560]  And I'll look at some of the bad people and look at something he just put in.
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:49.840]  A big union person, you know, in one of the positions, and it turns out Trump made a deal with the unions to get their people to vote for him.
[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:54.520]  So, and Trump's not eyeing retired General Keith Kellogg.
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:56.520]  He officially nominated him two hours ago.
[01:35:57.619 --> 01:36:01.500]  All right, let's play this important clip, and I'll go to your phone calls.
[01:36:01.539 --> 01:36:01.840]  Here it is.
[01:36:02.779 --> 01:36:07.100]  You could accept the fact that this city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportion.
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:08.680]  What do you mean, biblical?
[01:36:09.039 --> 01:36:11.239]  What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor.
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:13.279]  Real Wrath of God type stuff.
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.760]  Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies.
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:17.239]  Rivers and seas boiling.
[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:19.539]  40 years of darkness, earthquakes, volcanoes.
[01:36:19.779 --> 01:36:21.079]  The dead rising from the grave.
[01:36:21.279 --> 01:36:24.140]  Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together.
[01:36:24.439 --> 01:36:25.340]  Mass hysteria.
[01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:25.859]  My dad.
[01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:32.090]  His chemistry background, also a retired doctor, but he came in to help me run my supplement division 13 years ago.
[01:36:32.529 --> 01:36:33.890]  The deep state sued the hell out of him.
[01:36:34.029 --> 01:36:35.329]  We're going to our guest in a moment, but I gotta do this.
[01:36:35.409 --> 01:36:35.750]  Thank you, sir.
[01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:39.930]  And they basically almost destroyed my parents.
[01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:46.470]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family that might have been at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits Democrats filed.
[01:36:46.670 --> 01:36:50.470]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are $316 million yesterday.
[01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:53.420]  They filed before they spent $80 million suing me.
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:55.239]  We spent $16 million fighting them.
[01:36:55.479 --> 01:36:57.119]  My dad spent $2 million fighting them.
[01:36:57.180 --> 01:36:58.260]  And we're finally winning.
[01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:09.800]  Not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnaturals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request I ask you to support him because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:12.439]  He was giving everything to InfoWars.
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:19.960]  And then personally going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me because that's how dads are.
[01:37:20.329 --> 01:37:21.489]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[01:37:21.630 --> 01:37:26.489]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office.
[01:37:26.670 --> 01:37:27.729]  And I got pissed.
[01:37:28.369 --> 01:37:35.489]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[01:37:36.130 --> 01:37:37.210]  The supplements are there.
[01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:37.989]  They're great.
[01:37:38.170 --> 01:37:39.350]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[01:37:39.409 --> 01:37:40.710]  He's put everything into it he has.
[01:37:40.789 --> 01:37:41.369]  They're incredible.
[01:37:41.649 --> 01:37:51.310]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, that I don't want to belabor this.
[01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:52.609]  We have important topics to cover.
[01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:54.689]  Please support us.
[01:37:54.890 --> 01:37:56.409]  Go to drjones.com.
[01:37:56.689 --> 01:37:57.689]  There's a new sale.

[01:38:14.789 --> 01:38:15.550]  A big sale.
[01:38:15.729 --> 01:38:22.869]  And my dad literally took a loan last week to be able to buy the product that's coming in finally online.
[01:38:22.890 --> 01:38:25.729]  Next week, turbo force, things like that that are popular.
[01:38:25.930 --> 01:38:28.430]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[01:38:28.989 --> 01:38:32.930]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:34.590]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[01:38:34.729 --> 01:38:35.369]  He's a fighter.
[01:38:35.470 --> 01:38:36.329]  Hell, he's my dad.
[01:38:36.489 --> 01:38:37.449]  I think I'm a fighter.
[01:38:37.689 --> 01:38:39.090]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[01:38:39.729 --> 01:38:47.270]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[01:38:47.529 --> 01:38:50.130]  But this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:51.189]  It's about my parents.
[01:38:51.789 --> 01:38:57.289]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's why the enemy targeted them.
[01:38:57.789 --> 01:39:00.810]  So, please, support the info war today.
[01:39:00.930 --> 01:39:02.909]  Support my mother and my father.
[01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:05.909]  I'm asking you personally for you to do it now.
[01:39:06.109 --> 01:39:10.649]  And if 5% of the millions watching me go do it, all our problems will be over in one minute.
[01:39:10.770 --> 01:39:16.289]  But it's less than one half, one percent to ever buy anything from drjonesnagros.com, thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:19.930]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight for our futures.
[01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:23.590]  So, thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnagros.com.
[01:39:23.649 --> 01:39:25.189]  I'm going to shut up at the balance of this hour.
[01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:26.350]  All right.
[01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:28.229]  And that's the facts.
[01:39:28.710 --> 01:39:30.050]  Wednesday, World War III alert.
[01:39:30.289 --> 01:39:40.350]  World waits for President Trump to make a statement concerning the massive military escalations in Europe after Biden proposed giving nuclear weapons to Ukraine and NATO considers launching sneak attacks on Russia.
[01:39:41.770 --> 01:39:43.550]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:39:43.630 --> 01:39:44.710]  Appreciate you calling in.
[01:39:44.810 --> 01:39:48.050]  We're going to go to Jim, Joe, Ivan, Joshua, Ivan.
[01:39:50.029 --> 01:39:51.310]  Two Ivans, that's rare.
[01:39:51.689 --> 01:39:56.149]  Victoria, Brian, Brian, Tommy, Albert, and Tracy.
[01:39:58.210 --> 01:40:00.369]  Let's go to Georgia first.
[01:40:00.670 --> 01:40:01.890]  Let's talk to Joshua.
[01:40:01.989 --> 01:40:03.050]  You're on the air.
[01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.470]  Go ahead.
[01:40:04.289 --> 01:40:05.529]  Good morning, sir.
[01:40:06.289 --> 01:40:20.380]  First, I want to say thank you to you and your crew for a quarter of a century of giving us normies a good dose of Questioning everything.
[01:40:20.779 --> 01:40:23.159]  And don't stop until you find the truth.
[01:40:23.399 --> 01:40:27.800]  So I just want to say that, sir, and I hope you go on another quarter century.
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:29.260]  Well, I love you, brother.
[01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:30.899]  You have the power.
[01:40:31.239 --> 01:40:34.800]  Listeners and viewers, you decide if Jones keeps fighting.
[01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:36.579]  You are in command of me.
[01:40:36.659 --> 01:40:37.239]  Do you understand that?
[01:40:37.779 --> 01:40:38.779]  Yes, sir, I do.
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:44.199]  But without General Washington, we would not have been freed from England.
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:46.739]  So just take it and go with it.
[01:40:46.859 --> 01:40:47.000]  Thank you.
[01:40:48.739 --> 01:41:00.720]  Alright, so I called in with a topic that seemed kind of pissy to me, and I remembered while being on hold something I really wanted to get into, which is an actual solution.
[01:41:01.239 --> 01:41:06.039]  So if you'll bear with me for just a second, I've got the solution and how to implement it.
[01:41:06.199 --> 01:41:13.039]  Alright, first of all, Trump's inauguration has to happen before January 20th.
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:14.859]  I don't know any...
[01:41:16.439 --> 01:41:28.600]  There's no constitutional restriction on that other than whether or not Trump can get his horse carriage up to the Capitol to be inaugurated, like, you know, in 1789. So, that has to happen.
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:35.359]  Then, after that, when Trump takes office, Vance has to take control of the Senate.
[01:41:35.579 --> 01:41:45.119]  Now, I'm not smart enough to know, maybe get some constitutional lawyers in here to explain How that could or could not, you know, why it'd be a pipe dream or whatever.
[01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:51.720]  But let's say that they can't just, like, be sworn in by John Roberts.
[01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:52.399]  Okay.
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.439]  Now, the solution.
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:42:04.460]  You can't impeach Biden and Harris because that would put Mike Johnson into the presidency and, oh my God, you know, might as well have Harris.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:09.979]  So my solution is, This is not covered by the Constitution whatsoever.
[01:42:10.079 --> 01:42:21.800]  No articles cover if the country is in a crisis with a lame duck president who just wants to do what he wants and in the world.
[01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:24.500]  So therefore, you got the 10th Amendment.
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:30.560]  If nothing's covered in the Bill of Rights or even the Constitution, the states have the rights.
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:42.000]  So why can't we have the state legislatures Vote on this with a simple majority to go ahead and inaugurate Trump immediately, if not sooner.
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:46.539]  That's my comment on how to fix this World War III situation.
[01:42:46.819 --> 01:42:51.159]  Now, my original comment was, you know, did you wake up this morning and the sun's shining?
[01:42:51.439 --> 01:42:53.180]  That's all I need to hear from Trump.
[01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:59.720]  I don't need to hear, I don't need him to give me a speech on what he's doing, talking with Russia, talking with NATO, and da-da-da-da-da.
[01:42:59.899 --> 01:43:03.579]  I don't care because I woke up and no bombs have gone off yet.
[01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:13.510]  So as far as I'm concerned, Trump behind the scenes is doing all that he can as just the president-elect.
[01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:14.729]  All right, Joshua, I got to jump.
[01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:16.069]  Interesting points.
[01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.869]  Thank you.
[01:43:17.310 --> 01:43:20.890]  Look, 90% of war is information.
[01:43:22.939 --> 01:43:24.460]  There's massive escalations.
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:26.220]  There are bombs blowing up in Russia.
[01:43:26.439 --> 01:43:28.500]  More NATO countries are announcing they're going to start bombing.
[01:43:28.859 --> 01:43:30.840]  Biden's pushing giving nuclear weapons to Ukraine.
[01:43:31.199 --> 01:43:37.460]  NATO officially saying they might sneak attack Russia to push Russia into escalation.
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:38.880]  That needs to be repudiated.
[01:43:39.399 --> 01:43:41.920]  And we don't even know who's in control of the White House officially.
[01:43:42.199 --> 01:43:44.699]  Trump needs to point that out like he did last year.
[01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:46.539]  So...
[01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:50.409]  Rhetoric is key at this point.
[01:43:50.649 --> 01:43:54.909]  We need Trump to call for total de-escalation as his new national security advisor has.
[01:43:55.630 --> 01:43:57.130]  But I get your points.
[01:43:57.250 --> 01:44:03.710]  And yeah, there are constitutional ways to make the leader of the Senate the vice president.
[01:44:06.170 --> 01:44:08.909]  And I would take Mike Johnson over Kamala Harris.
[01:44:10.069 --> 01:44:13.109]  He's now more and more doing what Trump says.
[01:44:14.069 --> 01:44:15.529]  Ian in Texas, thanks for calling.
[01:44:15.670 --> 01:44:15.869]  Welcome.
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:18.220]  Yes, sir.
[01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:19.500]  Alex, appreciate you.
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:20.600]  Longtime listener, man.
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:23.619]  You saved a lot of people's lives by telling us not to take the vaccine.
[01:44:23.819 --> 01:44:26.979]  That's one of the most honorable things anyone can ever do.
[01:44:27.119 --> 01:44:27.359]  Thank you.
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:28.739]  Yes, sir.
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:32.319]  Man, I just want to mention, you know, I'm German heritage.
[01:44:32.399 --> 01:44:35.539]  My grandfather was in the SS in Poland, Eastern Front.
[01:44:35.859 --> 01:44:47.539]  You know, obviously our history is checkered with Russians, you know, through the last war, you know, World War II and It's basically, you know, Christians in Russia against Christians in Ukraine.
[01:44:47.779 --> 01:44:51.939]  There are some other sides to it, you know, some other small minorities involved.
[01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:56.159]  But, you know, as far as a war goes, they need to, you know, total ceasefire.
[01:44:56.340 --> 01:45:02.779]  And you're 100% correct that Trump needs to take the reins, potentially hold a peace summit somewhere like Geneva.
[01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:06.409]  You know, and they have to put a stop to this.
[01:45:06.529 --> 01:45:11.510]  You know, if the Donbass region goes to Russia in the long term, it is what it is.
[01:45:11.649 --> 01:45:16.909]  It's, you know, a small border to pay for such an issue.
[01:45:17.090 --> 01:45:19.569]  You know, these people should never have died in this war.
[01:45:19.710 --> 01:45:20.890]  This should have never happened.
[01:45:21.029 --> 01:45:21.449]  That's right.
[01:45:21.630 --> 01:45:23.609]  Most estimates are at a million now.
[01:45:23.729 --> 01:45:26.010]  Ron Paul's, look at the numbers, I agree with Dr. Paul.
[01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:27.829]  The low number is 600,000.
[01:45:27.970 --> 01:45:28.550]  So this is...
[01:45:29.130 --> 01:45:30.090]  A proxy war.
[01:45:30.649 --> 01:45:32.210]  NATO admits they started it.
[01:45:32.729 --> 01:45:33.869]  Trump's right when he says that.
[01:45:34.010 --> 01:45:39.470]  I mean, again, they've had George Soros and Fareed Zakaria six, seven years ago bragging how they did it with the State Department under Obama.
[01:45:39.949 --> 01:45:42.869]  So this is out of control, and it needs to stop now.
[01:45:44.210 --> 01:45:44.850]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:46.050 --> 01:45:47.189]  It has to end.
[01:45:47.329 --> 01:45:57.430]  I mean, there's You know, there's ways in 2024 to elevate ourselves into, hopefully, what the next generation will be in its business deals, and hopefully that's what Trump represents.
[01:45:57.729 --> 01:46:00.409]  You know, for example, Russia needs to use the port of Crimea.
[01:46:00.630 --> 01:46:01.829]  There's ways to rent it.
[01:46:01.890 --> 01:46:03.170]  There's ways to lease the port.
[01:46:03.329 --> 01:46:07.609]  There's ways to do everything through negotiation, diplomatic means, and business deals.
[01:46:07.810 --> 01:46:09.649]  Fighting is an old strategy.
[01:46:09.649 --> 01:46:11.189]  It needs to be forgotten about.
[01:46:11.489 --> 01:46:17.229]  You know, the U.S. government gave the Taliban, basically, You know, they gave them Afghanistan.
[01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:19.289]  $87 billion of weapons.
[01:46:20.250 --> 01:46:20.649]  Right.
[01:46:20.949 --> 01:46:32.170]  So, I mean, how can you give the Taliban, you know, a country and then say Russia doesn't deserve one or the Ukrainians don't deserve one or, you know, Israel doesn't deserve one or Palestine.
[01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:33.989]  Everybody deserves their area.
[01:46:34.529 --> 01:46:35.210]  I hear you.
[01:46:35.369 --> 01:46:35.909]  Great points.
[01:46:36.050 --> 01:46:36.970]  Look, I mean, here's the deal.
[01:46:37.859 --> 01:46:40.199]  Ukraine is not Russia's backyard.
[01:46:40.539 --> 01:46:41.960]  It's where Russia came from.
[01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:42.859]  It's Russian.
[01:46:43.079 --> 01:46:43.819]  We'll be right back.
[01:46:43.939 --> 01:46:44.399]  Stay with us.
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:50.359]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting to stop World War III. We are battling to get Trump into office.

[01:46:58.939 --> 01:47:00.960]  The purchase was fraudulent.
[01:47:01.319 --> 01:47:03.439]  There's emergency hearings in court coming up next week.
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:09.300]  But regardless, I'm gonna stay on air at the Alex Jones Network even if this shuts down.

[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:26.819]  They will not get the Alex Jones Network because I don't own it.

[01:48:04.039 --> 01:48:04.880]  They have the best designs.

[01:48:19.399 --> 01:48:23.319]  That famous meme of me coming out of the tunnel with all the Alex Jones clones.
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:25.340]  We are all Alex Jones.

[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:29.779]  Oh my goodness.
[01:48:30.199 --> 01:48:33.399]  What a way to wake folks up about all the poison in the water that's now mainstream news.
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:36.800]  1984 is not an instruction manual.
[01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:38.399]  Team Humanity.
[01:48:38.619 --> 01:48:40.100]  Oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[01:48:40.199 --> 01:48:42.420]  Launched that over a year ago with Elon Musk.
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:44.359]  And then, Dale Grebel.
[01:48:44.819 --> 01:48:49.979]  Oh, warns you about the government was right the whole time.
[01:48:50.399 --> 01:48:51.340]  Darkest Hour.
[01:48:51.579 --> 01:48:52.800]  Me is Winston Churchill.
[01:48:53.359 --> 01:48:57.899]  And so much more at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:48:57.939 --> 01:49:00.060]  Now, we don't make a ton off the t-shirts.
[01:49:00.609 --> 01:49:05.409]  We don't make a ton off the supplements because there's not a lot of markup in those, but we do sell a lot.
[01:49:05.550 --> 01:49:18.050]  But where we do get major funds is the marked up classic Alex Jones Infowars red on navy blue shirt and a few other fundraiser shirts that aren't 25 or 30 bucks, they're 50, so we get real money in.
[01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:21.829]  Because these t-shirts are high quality, printed right here in Arkansas in the United States.
[01:49:22.409 --> 01:49:25.750]  And so, extra, extra, extra large is like 16, 17 bucks.
[01:49:25.869 --> 01:49:28.189]  A small is like 15. The printing costs money.
[01:49:28.350 --> 01:49:29.609]  The sponsor gets part of the money.
[01:49:29.689 --> 01:49:30.949]  We get part of it to operate.
[01:49:31.569 --> 01:49:34.149]  We're making like six, seven bucks on the average t-shirt, which is great.
[01:49:34.270 --> 01:49:35.130]  And they spread the word.
[01:49:35.210 --> 01:49:35.869]  You meet like-minded people.
[01:49:36.010 --> 01:49:42.270]  But when you get the marked up shirts, only two of them are marked up to 50, we get some real money in to the operation.
[01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:45.529]  So if you really want to support, get the fundraiser shirts.
[01:49:45.869 --> 01:49:56.529]  Also, The posters, limited edition, back-to-back-to-back Trump win, all those are marked up where they cost us six, seven bucks to print them and to put it in the tube.
[01:49:56.750 --> 01:49:59.149]  So we make like 40-something bucks off that.
[01:49:59.270 --> 01:50:09.449]  If you really want to support us and hang it on the wall and know you supported the second American Revolution right at the critical point, then get some of the limited edition posters as well.
[01:50:09.569 --> 01:50:11.409]  But regardless, you're going to love the supplements.
[01:50:11.609 --> 01:50:12.869]  You're going to want to order again.
[01:50:13.109 --> 01:50:15.270]  We can't stay on air without your support.
[01:50:15.710 --> 01:50:16.729]  I'm suing the deep state.
[01:50:16.890 --> 01:50:17.689]  We're going after them.
[01:50:17.770 --> 01:50:23.829]  We have put all the stuff they did and the bid rigging and everything in these lawsuits and court filings.
[01:50:24.109 --> 01:50:25.289]  We're going to win this thing.
[01:50:25.409 --> 01:50:29.029]  But regardless, we've got to have money to continue to fight them and stay on air.
[01:50:29.170 --> 01:50:38.649]  So go now to thealexjonesstore.com for amazing products and know you stood with fellow Americans at the critical time to save our republic.
[01:50:39.949 --> 01:50:41.310]  Thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:50:41.409 --> 01:50:42.630]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:50:44.649 --> 01:50:45.649]  Alright, here's what I'm going to do.
[01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:47.489]  This station isn't carried by...
[01:50:47.489 --> 01:50:51.649]  This segment's not carried by a bunch of stations, so I won't get to all the callers.
[01:50:51.649 --> 01:50:52.550]  I want you all to be heard.
[01:50:53.869 --> 01:50:57.270]  John Bounce followed like 10 reports the last few days.
[01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:58.630]  One of them is really powerful.
[01:50:58.630 --> 01:51:02.390]  They're all powerful, but the one on the climate change propaganda's not working.
[01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:06.770]  And then I'm going to go to GMYTrump.
[01:51:08.319 --> 01:51:09.399]  Hasn't come out yet.
[01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:10.539]  Joe.
[01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:13.000]  Trump on tightrope right now.
[01:51:13.859 --> 01:51:14.140]  Ivan.
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:17.939]  UAP. WW3. Victoria.
[01:51:18.199 --> 01:51:18.359]  Trump.
[01:51:18.979 --> 01:51:19.699]  No statement yet.
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:20.279]  Comment on that.
[01:51:20.399 --> 01:51:20.720]  Brian.
[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:22.000]  Incoming war.
[01:51:23.279 --> 01:51:23.880]  Ukraine.
[01:51:24.119 --> 01:51:24.300]  India.
[01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:24.840]  Pakistan.
[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:25.319]  Russia.
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:25.720]  War.
[01:51:26.939 --> 01:51:27.539]  Tommy.
[01:51:28.609 --> 01:51:33.829]  In Georgia, Russia and Ukraine war, Albert in Texas, Trump, delayed reaction.
[01:51:34.130 --> 01:51:41.170]  I'm going to move to you folks quick when we come back and join all those stations.
[01:51:41.210 --> 01:51:42.390]  I want you to be heard by everybody.
[01:51:44.029 --> 01:51:50.329]  And then there's just a bunch of news that just broke out of England on the war that I'll get to in a moment.
[01:51:54.050 --> 01:51:55.210]  Here's part of the Jon Bowne report.
[01:51:55.289 --> 01:51:56.010]  It's a long report.
[01:51:56.130 --> 01:51:56.770]  It's actually eight minutes long.
[01:51:56.850 --> 01:51:57.789]  Here's the first three minutes of it.
[01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:05.909]  In five years, scientists predict we will have the first ice-free Arctic summer.
[01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:20.189]  Self-serving skull and bones globalist John Kerry is rearing his fugly head as the globalists now set their sights on the next phase of human enslavement via climate change indoctrination.
[01:52:20.369 --> 01:52:23.529]  Scientists telling us that we are in uncharted territory.
[01:52:24.310 --> 01:52:35.399]  This group has come together to try to figure out, okay, how do we deploy the funds necessary to invest To create the new clean energy economy.
[01:52:35.699 --> 01:52:38.659]  First ever special presidential envoy for climate.
[01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:51.159]  Mr. Kerry, you're sitting in a newly created position, but from all of the research that I've done in two years, you've largely managed to avoid any real oversight or accountability in that position.
[01:52:51.319 --> 01:53:00.119]  But the truth is, because of the lack of transparency, No one really knows exactly what it is that you are representing.
[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:07.659]  Carrie's private jet emitted more carbon in one flight than your family car will in your entire lifetime.
[01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:09.350]  We don't own a private jet.
[01:53:09.489 --> 01:53:10.550]  I don't own a private jet.
[01:53:10.670 --> 01:53:12.510]  I personally have never owned a private jet.
[01:53:12.649 --> 01:53:18.750]  And obviously, it's pretty stupid to talk about coming in a private jet from the State Department up here.
[01:53:19.670 --> 01:53:22.789]  Just honestly, if that's where you want to go, go there.
[01:53:22.989 --> 01:53:30.109]  Mr. Secretary, in exchange with Mr. Mills, you just testified under oath that you never owned a private jet.
[01:53:31.050 --> 01:53:32.829]  Mr. Chairman, I'd like to enter into the record.
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:45.140]  Article here from February 15th of 2023 that the John Kerry family private jet was sold shortly after accusations of climate hypocrisy.
[01:53:45.359 --> 01:53:50.819]  Mr. Secretary, do you stand by that testimony that you've never owned or your family?
[01:53:51.199 --> 01:53:52.500]  I personally, yes.
[01:53:52.699 --> 01:53:54.520]  My wife owned a plane and she sold the plane.
[01:53:55.279 --> 01:53:57.859]  All of my trips are commercial airlines.
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:02.220]  Have you flown on a private jet in a personal or official capacity since you've taken this position?
[01:54:03.679 --> 01:54:04.819]  Possibly once.
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:15.479]  Kerry acts as a ringleader to the Mockingbird media and the many in the U.S. Capitol going rogue for the New World Order inside the halls of our republic.
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:20.380]  The idea that there's not global warming, I think, can't be denied by anybody anymore.
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:25.220]  And we're doing everything that we can to tackle the root causes of climate change.
[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:28.079]  This is why the Inflation Reduction Act is so important.
[01:54:28.439 --> 01:54:39.500]  They've already announced in her office that Once the public will be open to it, we're going to start focusing mainly on climate.
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:42.500]  So our next thing is going to be for climate change awareness.
[01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:59.520]  You look at the storms, you look at the disasters, and if you're still denying the impact of climate change and the impact of billions and billions of Americans pumping carbon into the atmosphere, you're living in an alternate reality.
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:00.640]  You really are.
[01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.909]  Do your part.
[01:55:02.109 --> 01:55:07.689]  Actively declare the New World Order's climate change ruse dead on arrival.
[01:55:07.930 --> 01:55:13.050]  Why do you think 195 countries in the world They're prime ministers.
[01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:14.029]  They're presidents.
[01:55:14.250 --> 01:55:16.090]  Because they're grifting like you are, sir.
[01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.489]  All right.
[01:55:17.670 --> 01:55:28.229]  Trump has appointed General Kellogg, who is a very good general, pro-America, America first, anti-neocon, globalist World War III, the emergency envoy to Ukraine.
[01:55:28.750 --> 01:55:30.130]  That is a good sign.
[01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:33.050]  He's also got Congressman Waltz.
[01:55:33.329 --> 01:55:40.050]  His national security advisor said we need to de-escalate right now, that we're on the threat escalation ladder to total nuclear war, which I've been telling you for a long time.
[01:55:42.609 --> 01:55:46.550]  We're good to go.
[01:55:47.409 --> 01:55:59.109]  We're good to go.
[01:56:01.930 --> 01:56:02.770]  That's the Daily Mail.
[01:56:02.949 --> 01:56:03.829]  It's everywhere else as well.
[01:56:03.989 --> 01:56:04.670]  This is a big one.
[01:56:05.069 --> 01:56:06.210]  Remember, I told you this last week.
[01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:18.329]  I said within 48 hours, and it started, 36 hours later, you'll start seeing senior, former, and current officials around the world in the military and intelligence agencies saying we're already at war with Russia.
[01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:20.689]  Ukraine war latest.
[01:56:21.010 --> 01:56:21.829]  Sky News.
[01:56:21.970 --> 01:56:29.510]  That's Fox News in the UK. Europe is in, quote, actual war with Russia, says former MI6 chief.
[01:56:31.649 --> 01:56:32.489]  Peace through strength.
[01:56:32.630 --> 01:56:37.390]  Trump nominates retired General Keith Kellogg as Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia.
[01:56:38.409 --> 01:56:47.109]  Meanwhile, the Pentagon's pledging to buck Trump and try to keep World War III going and to not help round up any illegal aliens, which is treason.
[01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:52.029]  But their senior staff, senior military, is telling the rest of the military it's an illegal order.
[01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:54.649]  When you can read the damn Constitution, it's not.
[01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:55.810]  Look what Eisenhower did.
[01:56:56.250 --> 01:56:57.470]  Look what Reagan did.
[01:56:57.630 --> 01:56:59.229]  I mean, this is pure bulls.
[01:57:01.159 --> 01:57:04.100]  You got mayors, Democrats saying, we're going to fight you physically.
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:07.920]  And then the head of ISIS will arrest you.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:08.500]  That's illegal.
[01:57:08.979 --> 01:57:10.859]  And he lists the code number.
[01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:12.079]  You're going to get me.
[01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:12.840]  You're going to hurt me.
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:17.659]  Meanwhile, Russia accelerates its advance in Ukraine's east.
[01:57:18.939 --> 01:57:21.199]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to your calls here.
[01:57:21.659 --> 01:57:23.420]  Jim, thanks for calling from Indiana and holding.
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:27.619]  Give us your take on why Trump hasn't come out yet with calls for peace.
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:29.260]  Hey, Alex.
[01:57:29.399 --> 01:57:35.000]  I wanted to thank you for being the general in this information ward and supporting your troops, which is your listeners.
[01:57:35.239 --> 01:57:35.699]  Thank you, sir.
[01:57:36.439 --> 01:57:44.000]  I do believe that he is going to come out today or by noon tomorrow and say that he has an agreement for at least a temporary ceasefire.
[01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:47.939]  And I don't think he wants to come out until everything is finalized.
[01:57:48.399 --> 01:57:49.800]  That's just how he operates.
[01:57:49.939 --> 01:57:53.140]  He doesn't want to come out the day before Thanksgiving and say, we're going to war.
[01:57:54.020 --> 01:57:59.109]  But I do believe if we don't hear from him by noon tomorrow, Things probably aren't looking very good.
[01:58:01.010 --> 01:58:08.989]  I think that is probably a most accurate approximation if we have to dead record and speculate with all the knowledge we have.
[01:58:09.850 --> 01:58:10.609]  I agree.
[01:58:10.789 --> 01:58:15.750]  And I think he has really been working hard on it around the clock with all of these people.
[01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:18.130]  And I think he's probably very close to it.
[01:58:20.119 --> 01:58:33.380]  Well, we are seeing a lot of rumblings, I mentioned last hour, from senior diplomats in the EU, NATO, and the UK, along with his new national security advisor, Congressman Waltz, saying just that.
[01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:35.760]  Now there's suddenly calls to, quote, de-escalate.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.960]  We're hearing about the threat escalation ladder.
[01:58:38.119 --> 01:58:39.779]  And again, folks, that's just 101 and all this.
[01:58:40.039 --> 01:58:41.859]  Notice you never hear any of that in the news.
[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:43.479]  You ever hear about threat escalation ladders?
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:47.880]  Now his new national security advisor is talking about that because that's a known war game thing.
[01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:51.579]  So, that's a weird term I use a lot with listeners.
[01:58:51.579 --> 01:58:52.199]  Like, what's that?
[01:58:52.319 --> 01:58:53.180]  But, I mean, this is important.
[01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:56.020]  So, yeah, I mean, we know he's doing behind-the-scenes detente.
[01:58:56.060 --> 01:58:56.439]  That's admitted.
[01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:57.699]  We know the head of NATO went there last week.
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:58:58.840]  We know he's making these phone calls.
[01:58:59.899 --> 01:59:01.819]  So, yeah, that's certainly good news.
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:03.520]  And so, I hope you're right.
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:05.619]  I do, too.
[01:59:05.779 --> 01:59:07.920]  And we're praying for you and all the American people.
[01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:09.119]  Well, I appreciate you.
[01:59:09.239 --> 01:59:09.800]  Anything else, Jim?
[01:59:10.779 --> 01:59:11.600]  Nope, that's it.
[01:59:12.039 --> 01:59:14.300]  Just thank you and your crew for everything you do.
[01:59:14.479 --> 01:59:15.020]  Thank you, brother.
[01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:16.140]  Thank you for keeping us on air.
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:20.720]  Thanks for your word of mouth and your support at thealexshownstore.com.
[01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:29.699]  And again, folks, we are fabulously successful, thanks for your word of mouth and your support, reaching tens of millions of people a day.
[01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:31.739]  And I love our regular audience.
[01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:32.380]  You're the core.
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:38.359]  But you are the outreach, the word of mouth, the support to reach all these new people.
[01:59:38.659 --> 01:59:40.359]  And that's what we want to do is win.
[01:59:40.539 --> 01:59:42.899]  We're not in a bubble here.
[01:59:43.479 --> 01:59:44.479]  And we're doing it.
[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:45.920]  But when it comes to the funding...
[01:59:47.450 --> 01:59:49.329]  It's a C- and I'm not bitching.
[01:59:49.390 --> 01:59:51.109]  I'm just like, I don't want to belabor this stuff.
[01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:55.590]  If I didn't have to plug any and we had plenty of funds, I would not do it.
[01:59:55.670 --> 01:59:57.289]  But these are really great products.
[01:59:57.449 --> 01:59:58.270]  Amazing supplements.
[01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:59.289]  Amazing Patriot gear.
[01:59:59.409 --> 02:00:00.729]  It's all at thealexshownstore.com.
[02:00:00.890 --> 02:00:02.369]  And I humbly thank you for your support.
[02:00:02.710 --> 02:00:04.949]  All right, let's go to Joe in Oregon.
[02:00:05.170 --> 02:00:07.689]  World War III Trump on a tightrope right now, you say.
[02:00:07.890 --> 02:00:08.770]  Joe, tell us more.
[02:00:10.069 --> 02:00:10.710]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:10.850 --> 02:00:11.810]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:00:12.199 --> 02:00:17.539]  You know, I go back to what Gerald Salente often says, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:24.060]  And it's really an unfortunate fact that our entire economic basis is currently tied to forever wars.
[02:00:24.579 --> 02:00:31.840]  So Trump is walking a tightrope right now because anything he says will be used against him in the court of mainstream media.
[02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:43.260]  Anything he says or does contrary to the war machine also bears the risk of damaging our economy, which is already on the rocks.
[02:00:46.300 --> 02:01:06.449]  Well, you know, Alex, you keep mentioning state and county government, and that's really the crux of why I called in, because I think a lot of the issues in America are due to the fact that we keep looking upward toward our elected leaders who are driven,
[02:01:06.689 --> 02:01:12.930]  and I'm not going to put this on all of them, but many of them are driven by service to self rather than service to others.
[02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:14.470]  They're not really fit to lead.
[02:01:15.050 --> 02:01:27.949]  But I also look around in our state and local communities where I'm involved in my own state and local community, and I think 99% of the problems we face can be addressed at home.
[02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:37.130]  And we really have to look at ourselves and how our own state, counties, and municipalities in general are linked to the war machine.
[02:01:37.149 --> 02:01:40.390]  And we have to find ways of developing.
[02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:45.390]  I mean, we're entering potentially a golden era, but it's on us to build it.
[02:01:45.609 --> 02:01:49.010]  We have to build it in our own homes, our own communities.
[02:01:49.630 --> 02:01:54.029]  And it's going to take a little imagination and some capital, but we can get there.
[02:01:54.529 --> 02:01:57.970]  So Trump, again, he's walking a tightrope.
[02:01:58.649 --> 02:02:00.250]  You guys should be careful what he says right now.
[02:02:00.409 --> 02:02:12.329]  We were just presented with, you know, during his first presidency, four years of nonstop onslaught daily in the mainstream media about character attacks and all that apparently was lies.
[02:02:12.590 --> 02:02:16.210]  So, you know, that may be a big distraction.
[02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:19.270]  Obviously, World War III affects us all.
[02:02:19.949 --> 02:02:23.050]  But again, I think the...
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:37.340]  No, I totally agree.
[02:02:37.659 --> 02:02:47.000]  You know, the globalists in BlackRock and the UN, they come into the counties and cities all over the world, the different regions, inside other nations, the provinces, and they say...
[02:02:47.939 --> 02:02:49.520]  You know, think global, act local.
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:53.640]  So they're following their globalist agenda, but they act locally, and that's where the rubber meets the road.
[02:02:53.899 --> 02:02:54.560]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:02:54.659 --> 02:02:55.159]  Great points.
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:59.439]  All right, let's go to Brian in Massachusetts on the incoming intensifying war.
[02:02:59.560 --> 02:02:59.859]  Go ahead.
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:02.039]  What's going on, Alex?
[02:03:02.140 --> 02:03:02.520]  How are you?
[02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:02.939]  Good, sir.
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:03.220]  Go ahead.
[02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:04.720]  All right.
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:10.100]  I wanted to be alive for the Cuban Missile Crisis, right?
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:11.939]  I know you weren't either.
[02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:18.659]  But what is going on with nobody caring about any of this?
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:22.239]  Like, why is this not front-line news 24-7?
[02:03:22.439 --> 02:03:23.439]  Nobody cares.
[02:03:23.659 --> 02:03:24.279]  Everyone's asleep.
[02:03:27.220 --> 02:03:31.340]  Yeah, there's some protests in Europe about the World War III because we're so close to it.
[02:03:31.420 --> 02:03:34.720]  But being here is just as close as being in Europe in a nuclear war.
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:36.020]  The submarines are off our coast.
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:39.439]  And, yeah, I mean, people are really...
[02:03:49.210 --> 02:03:50.609]  Right.
[02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:56.409]  Right.
[02:03:56.430 --> 02:03:56.449]  Right.
[02:03:58.090 --> 02:03:59.489]  Right.
[02:04:03.699 --> 02:04:11.140]  And so, from my perspective, it seems like the Russia-Ukraine conflict could really spill out to everywhere else.
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:21.680]  And what's going on in Israel is not as detrimental to the rest of us, but it seems worse for all the civilians over there.
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:31.579]  There's so many children, and it just seems like Trump is more dovish about Israel and Palestine than he is with Ukraine and Russia.
[02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:43.060]  I mean, he did get the Abraham Accords and that, because that's obviously important for global stability and a lot of other issues, energy.
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:47.600]  But Trump's been really vocal when he has been vocal.
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:51.640]  He was very vocal on the campaign and very vocal until he got elected.
[02:04:51.899 --> 02:04:54.699]  And I understand he's behind the scenes, and that's a fact.
[02:04:54.699 --> 02:04:57.140]  He's trying to get major announcements done, but...
[02:04:58.029 --> 02:05:02.090]  I mean, I do agree with you that the war with Russia is way more important.
[02:05:02.449 --> 02:05:07.250]  I mean, I'm glad that Israel has a ceasefire with Lebanon.
[02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:09.149]  That's good.
[02:05:09.149 --> 02:05:09.930]  I appreciate your call.
[02:05:11.529 --> 02:05:15.250]  Brian in Minnesota on Ukraine, India, Pakistan, Russia equals war.
[02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:16.029]  What do you mean by that?
[02:05:18.069 --> 02:05:18.949]  Hi, Alex.
[02:05:19.149 --> 02:05:20.430]  I'm Ryan from Minnesota.
[02:05:20.430 --> 02:05:25.170]  And first, I want to say thank you for the Next Level Foundation energy product.
[02:05:25.529 --> 02:05:35.189]  You know, living here in Minnesota, Having that product, especially waking up in the morning, is one way that I've just been able to start the day.
[02:05:35.329 --> 02:05:39.270]  I'm able to get the kids in the car and get to daycare on time.
[02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:47.569]  So I urge everyone to go out there and order some of that next level foundational energy, especially if you're in a northern climate like Minnesota.
[02:05:48.189 --> 02:05:52.069]  It really is a game changer when you're looking at winter for the next four months.
[02:05:53.529 --> 02:05:56.970]  I wanted to address the topic about Ukraine and Russia.
[02:05:57.599 --> 02:06:02.960]  In the gospel today, it says the nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:11.579]  I know that war is going to be big, but I'm wondering if that will spill off into India and Pakistan and what your thoughts are on that as well.
[02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:15.020]  Well, I totally agree with what you're saying.
[02:06:16.439 --> 02:06:20.180]  It's been heavily war-gamed by every major power in the world.
[02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:24.079]  It's been all of this forever that India and Pakistan hate each other.
[02:06:24.420 --> 02:06:25.640]  They've had a lot of wars.
[02:06:28.150 --> 02:06:35.409]  And they both got big nuclear arsenals, and then India and China are fighting with each other, physically, over Kashmir.
[02:06:36.649 --> 02:06:39.310]  And China's been allied with the Muslims against India.
[02:06:39.630 --> 02:06:45.909]  And now, of course, you got Modi over there that is a Hindu fundamentalist, is standing up for the end-to-end.
[02:06:46.010 --> 02:06:47.569]  India used to be twice as big as it is now.
[02:06:47.630 --> 02:06:48.689]  The Muslims have been taking it over.
[02:06:49.489 --> 02:06:53.989]  And so they've basically taken cashmere from the Hindus and were ethically cleansing them.
[02:06:54.069 --> 02:06:56.270]  So Modi went in there and ran them out.
[02:06:57.250 --> 02:07:00.250]  And so, yeah, that's a major trigger as well.
[02:07:00.369 --> 02:07:00.970]  So is North Korea.
[02:07:03.590 --> 02:07:05.670]  Well, I want to say thank you.
[02:07:05.789 --> 02:07:07.529]  I'm a founding member coin holder.
[02:07:07.529 --> 02:07:09.050]  I also have the signed books.
[02:07:09.050 --> 02:07:15.289]  But I really want to tell everyone to get out there and go and support Alex's dad by buying that.
[02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:17.699]  Next Level Foundational Energy.
[02:07:17.699 --> 02:07:19.100]  It's a great product.
[02:07:19.359 --> 02:07:21.439]  And thanks for having me on the show today, Alex.
[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:22.819]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:07:22.899 --> 02:07:24.439]  I really, really appreciate you calling in.
[02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:42.229]  I want to thank everybody that did get the coins, which helped fund The backup network, AJN Live, because I knew they could shut us down then, and that's what your support did, because it was going on back then.
[02:07:42.829 --> 02:07:44.409]  So thank you so much.
[02:07:45.229 --> 02:07:55.710]  I used a third-party company to make those coins and put up that shopping cart and sell those.
[02:07:57.590 --> 02:08:13.409]  And I had intended with everybody that did buy the coins to then send the people on the coin list special stuff at a certain point,
[02:08:13.409 --> 02:08:14.250]  which we would have already done.
[02:08:16.369 --> 02:08:21.289]  In fact, I was intending, when I do another book, to send you a free book and more.
[02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:28.800]  And then the company that I used to do that Said, you know what?
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:32.159]  We're not going to give you the names, people that bought the stuff, and we're not going to let you do that.
[02:08:32.439 --> 02:08:36.380]  Or you need to do X, Y, Z. And I just went, wow, that's really horrible.
[02:08:37.199 --> 02:08:38.239]  And I haven't had the...
[02:08:38.239 --> 02:08:39.520]  That's what this country's like now.
[02:08:39.739 --> 02:08:42.800]  And I haven't had money to sue the person.
[02:08:44.159 --> 02:08:45.939]  And I just said, why would you do that to my listeners?
[02:08:46.020 --> 02:08:51.840]  Just let me have the names so I can just at least send them a calendar once a year or something.
[02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:52.340]  Nope.
[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:53.399]  Can't have it.
[02:09:00.539 --> 02:09:02.680]  I've almost talked about this on air, but there's just...
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:03.859]  World War III and stuff is too important.
[02:09:04.119 --> 02:09:05.619]  Then it pisses me off.
[02:09:05.699 --> 02:09:09.399]  Because I didn't say I promised people that got the coin were founding members that you'd even, you know...
[02:09:09.399 --> 02:09:11.500]  I just said you're doing something very special, which you did.
[02:09:12.159 --> 02:09:14.279]  You funded the backup stuff and some things.
[02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:15.680]  I'm not going to get into.
[02:09:15.859 --> 02:09:17.520]  But it just pisses me off.
[02:09:18.220 --> 02:09:19.119]  That's a side issue.
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.260]  But talking about what's been done to me...
[02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:26.180]  Where people, it's like a demonic.
[02:09:26.380 --> 02:09:30.479]  It's not like, it's like there's a demonic spirit that it's open season on Alex Jones.
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:35.920]  And if you can screw him or hurt him or do something to him, it's like gets you brownie points with the devil.
[02:09:36.319 --> 02:09:37.119]  That's all I can say.
[02:09:37.159 --> 02:09:42.600]  I mean, because people just go, the listeners got their way to hold us up and let us survive this fight because we're all fighting together.
[02:09:43.199 --> 02:09:46.340]  But there are other people out there that will just go out.
[02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:50.899]  I mean, like I've had two U.S. trustees try to shut us down without court orders.
[02:09:51.180 --> 02:09:53.300]  And one of them try to set me up and put me in jail.
[02:09:54.119 --> 02:09:55.060]  And of course, he got caught.
[02:09:56.199 --> 02:10:07.180]  And it's just like, all because I'm trying to stop World War III and I don't want to cut little boys' penises off and I don't want 200,000 deaths a year of fentanyl and I believe in America.
[02:10:07.380 --> 02:10:15.340]  I mean, it's like, but they see the system attacking me and the people think, well, if we just attack him too, we'll get in good with it.
[02:10:15.439 --> 02:10:16.420]  It's disgusting.
[02:10:17.399 --> 02:10:19.479]  But those people all bet on the wrong team.
[02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:22.840]  All right, Tommy in Georgia, you're on the air.
[02:10:22.979 --> 02:10:23.199]  Welcome.
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:26.579]  Alex, can you hear me?
[02:10:26.699 --> 02:10:26.960]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:27.239]  Go ahead.
[02:10:28.039 --> 02:10:28.220]  Okay.
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:29.539]  Alex, you're amazing.
[02:10:29.659 --> 02:10:30.420]  Your crew is amazing.
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:32.039]  I'm a first-time caller.
[02:10:32.220 --> 02:10:33.619]  I want to jump right into it.
[02:10:33.859 --> 02:10:34.960]  I have a few points.
[02:10:35.140 --> 02:10:36.239]  I have them written down here.
[02:10:36.239 --> 02:10:37.159]  I'll make them super brief.
[02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:39.800]  I like to go right for the jugular.
[02:10:39.939 --> 02:10:41.020]  You stop me when you're not interested.
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:44.819]  But these are basically things I haven't heard about yet.
[02:10:45.119 --> 02:10:56.310]  First point is about what the first Brian was talking about, which is that InfoWars, General Flynn, Tucker, Trump and Rogan are the only ones that are bringing this up.
[02:10:56.409 --> 02:10:57.949]  I mean, Trump's not, but he knows about it.
[02:10:59.050 --> 02:11:00.829]  And just about how serious this is.
[02:11:00.930 --> 02:11:03.970]  The media has been super silent and downplaying this.
[02:11:04.689 --> 02:11:08.569]  I do think that Rogan should interview General Flynn or General Kellogg.
[02:11:09.010 --> 02:11:10.069]  The sooner the better.
[02:11:10.289 --> 02:11:11.590]  This would really get the word out.
[02:11:12.670 --> 02:11:17.449]  Elon interviewing General Flynn or General Kellogg on X would also be good.
[02:11:19.729 --> 02:11:20.489]  Next point.
[02:11:21.079 --> 02:11:37.619]  Is my only question, which is to you, Alex, which is that I've heard that one of the only protections to civilians and martial law situation in the U.S. is that civilians are tried in a civilian court rather than military tribunals.
[02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:56.289]  Could the Democrats be stacking Democrat judges on bench seats with the purpose of being in lockstep with Biden causing World War III and thus now they can have faulty trials against I don't think there's any speculation about that.
[02:12:15.889 --> 02:12:22.010]  It's like more than 500 of Trump's lawyers have been disbarred, sued, criminally charged.
[02:12:22.250 --> 02:12:25.510]  Again, a month before the election, the Democrats officially said it was in Politico.
[02:12:26.370 --> 02:12:31.069]  We're going to criminally investigate and indict and disbar and sue.
[02:12:31.649 --> 02:12:35.250]  They didn't say if you corruptly serve Trump, which they used to say.
[02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:43.109]  They said if you take him as a client or the RNC as a client with his daughter-in-law running it, we're going to destroy you.
[02:12:43.149 --> 02:12:49.430]  That's racketeering when big, powerful organizations say we're going to persecute you if you don't do what we say.
[02:12:49.489 --> 02:12:54.189]  That's the mafia saying we're going to burn down your grocery store if you don't pay us protection money.
[02:12:54.899 --> 02:12:57.119]  And yeah, so no, that's not speculation.
[02:12:57.119 --> 02:12:59.079]  That's exactly what they've been gearing up for.
[02:13:01.119 --> 02:13:05.779]  Okay, did the GOP just give them the keys to the kingdom then?
[02:13:06.859 --> 02:13:10.520]  Because they just basically gave them, what is it, 13 seats?
[02:13:13.079 --> 02:13:17.260]  Are you talking about the Democrats or Congress just approved a bunch of judges?
[02:13:18.119 --> 02:13:18.600]  Yes.
[02:13:19.119 --> 02:13:23.140]  Yeah, I mean, they don't have them all, but yeah, it's not good.
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:25.079]  Okay.
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:30.000]  But I mean, I don't know if Biden and his controllers are going to be able to...
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:30.720]  I mean, Harris looks like...
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:31.760]  I haven't gotten this video yet.
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:36.039]  Because a lot of conservative talk shows are like celebrating the left crying.
[02:13:36.239 --> 02:13:36.880]  And it's fun.
[02:13:36.939 --> 02:13:37.319]  I get it.
[02:13:37.420 --> 02:13:38.380]  And look at Kamala.
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:40.159]  She looks like she's 20 years older and totally drunk.
[02:13:41.119 --> 02:13:42.640]  But they're just the front people.
[02:13:43.859 --> 02:13:48.000]  So I don't know if they're going to get their trigger for martial law.
[02:13:48.979 --> 02:13:53.739]  That's why I'm saying we can't wait for Trump to have a peace deal already done to announce it.
[02:13:54.439 --> 02:13:58.020]  We need to get him out front of this, repudiating them.
[02:13:58.180 --> 02:14:06.140]  He has incredible power to warn the public that's already anti-war, 80 plus percent, and put pressure on Congress and the rest of them to stop it.
[02:14:06.260 --> 02:14:07.340]  I appreciate your call.
[02:14:08.100 --> 02:14:10.119]  Let's talk to Victoria in Maryland.
[02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:11.140]  Victoria, thanks for calling.
[02:14:11.239 --> 02:14:11.420]  Welcome.
[02:14:12.779 --> 02:14:13.500]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:18.859]  I have an opinion about Trump not making a statement yet, and I hope I'm wrong.
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:27.500]  I completely agree with you that Trump should get out in front of this run interference against the U.S., escalating the issue with Russia and Putin.
[02:14:28.279 --> 02:14:33.319]  I don't know if you've heard, but Sebastian Gorka is now the deputy to President Trump.
[02:14:33.500 --> 02:14:40.579]  And I like Sebastian Gorka and agree with Sebastian Gorka on many things except his stance on Russia.
[02:14:42.029 --> 02:14:47.430]  He thinks that Putin is a threat to the EU. And I cannot...
[02:14:47.430 --> 02:14:48.770]  I disagree with that.
[02:14:48.869 --> 02:14:53.810]  I don't see any receipts that Putin is a threat to the EU. What do you think?
[02:14:55.569 --> 02:14:58.529]  Well, I don't think Gorka the gay whale...
[02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:02.300]  This is important enough to talk about.
[02:15:02.739 --> 02:15:09.020]  I've had in my stack since he got nominated Friday, last Friday.
[02:15:09.659 --> 02:15:11.020]  And let me dig in the stack.
[02:15:11.140 --> 02:15:13.199]  I actually put this from the stack back in here.
[02:15:13.319 --> 02:15:15.279]  So I was thinking about covering it today.
[02:15:15.399 --> 02:15:19.460]  Because I've got examples of different nominations, different people, some good, some bad.
[02:15:19.899 --> 02:15:23.479]  And Gorka is just...
[02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:27.199]  If anybody is a sadistic narcissist, it's him.
[02:15:27.319 --> 02:15:32.079]  If anybody is a fake military, all that, it's him.
[02:15:32.899 --> 02:15:35.159]  And I just know the behind the scenes things on him.
[02:15:35.220 --> 02:15:35.739]  He's just not...
[02:15:36.699 --> 02:15:38.159]  Important enough for you to talk about.
[02:15:38.399 --> 02:15:41.039]  I know he tried to get me thrown out of CPAC, other people.
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:43.800]  He's an imperious little creature.
[02:15:44.979 --> 02:15:54.720]  I know that he is definitely, in my view, a double dealer, and I wouldn't turn my back on him.
[02:15:54.819 --> 02:15:58.460]  But the deputy head of counterterrorism, I mean...
[02:15:59.810 --> 02:16:02.649]  Gorka is just the guy that's going to bring Trump reports.
[02:16:04.149 --> 02:16:07.170]  And so, yeah, you're right.
[02:16:07.270 --> 02:16:09.470]  He said that Tucker Carlson was a Russian agent.
[02:16:09.949 --> 02:16:12.130]  And he went along with the Russia, Russia, Russia.
[02:16:12.250 --> 02:16:15.569]  He never said it about Trump, but he is a neocon.
[02:16:16.289 --> 02:16:20.390]  And that fake British accent, I mean, this guy is hilarious, actually.
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:24.340]  And again, his name sounds like a whale name.
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:27.359]  And then it's funny to say he's a gay whale.
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:30.319]  And it's not bad if he's gay.
[02:16:30.399 --> 02:16:31.100]  I'm not saying he's gay.
[02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:31.819]  I haven't heard that.
[02:16:33.390 --> 02:16:42.569]  But I mean, if I was going to cast somebody to make a remake or like a movie about Liberace, Gorka would be who I would hire.
[02:16:43.629 --> 02:16:45.569]  And that's why I call him Gorka the Gay Whale.
[02:16:46.690 --> 02:16:48.510]  So, yeah, here's some of the headlines.
[02:16:49.049 --> 02:16:54.389]  Former Trump advisor Sebastian Gorka the Gay Whale returning to the White House.
[02:16:55.290 --> 02:16:58.149]  Trump is really dropping the ball today.
[02:16:58.670 --> 02:17:00.629]  That's what folks were saying about Gorka.
[02:17:01.129 --> 02:17:02.870]  And here's some examples of it.
[02:17:02.969 --> 02:17:03.450]  Here's Gorka, though.
[02:17:03.510 --> 02:17:09.510]  Okay, well, here is Sebastian Gorka saying Tucker Carlson is maybe an agent of the Kremlin.
[02:17:10.629 --> 02:17:16.090]  And again, this is the kind of stuff that Gorka does.
[02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:21.530]  I remember when Americans didn't do PR for KGB colonels.
[02:17:21.629 --> 02:17:23.989]  Well, without being agents of the Kremlin.
[02:17:25.260 --> 02:17:26.680]  So that's what Gorka said.
[02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:30.840]  You know, I think he protests a little bit with his Eastern European background.
[02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:32.479]  Maybe he works for the Russians.
[02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:33.260]  I mean, I don't know that.
[02:17:34.180 --> 02:17:36.100]  But Tucker Carlson sure doesn't.
[02:17:36.100 --> 02:17:37.579]  Tucker Carlson's an American.
[02:17:38.540 --> 02:17:39.840]  Gorka, well, he's a gay whale.
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:40.399]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:41.090 --> 02:17:48.450]  Well, the winner, Chris DiLaro, is here in studio from New Jersey, former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[02:17:48.450 --> 02:17:49.569]  What an amazing aircraft.
[02:17:49.909 --> 02:17:54.989]  This is one of the pinnacles in my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there, just being in this studio.
[02:17:54.989 --> 02:17:56.209]  I never imagined I'd be here.
[02:17:56.209 --> 02:17:57.129]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[02:17:57.229 --> 02:17:57.829]  You're the reason we're here.
[02:17:57.909 --> 02:17:58.709]  I can't wait.
[02:17:59.209 --> 02:18:01.389]  To learn who the next winner is.
[02:18:01.530 --> 02:18:03.969]  And even if they shut out InfoWars, the Alex Jones Network continues on.
[02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:06.149]  TheAlexJonesTour.com is not owned by me.
[02:18:06.270 --> 02:18:10.350]  So we now know it's the Democratic Party and the biggest gun control group that was behind all the fake lawsuits.
[02:18:10.510 --> 02:18:11.090]  We already knew that.
[02:18:11.209 --> 02:18:12.430]  But now they've bragged about it.
[02:18:12.549 --> 02:18:17.629]  Whether these people are successful or not, and I believe they won't be, we're going to continue on at the Alex Jones Network.
[02:18:17.850 --> 02:18:20.430]  And so this baby is the new promotion.
[02:18:20.809 --> 02:18:21.889]  And I will be...
[02:18:22.190 --> 02:18:30.049]  Delivering this bad boy and $10,000 cash to you from myself and the entire Infowars family and the Alex Shows Network family.
[02:18:30.229 --> 02:18:31.690]  You are our family.
[02:18:32.010 --> 02:18:33.129]  God bless you all.
[02:18:33.370 --> 02:18:36.370]  Now go to thealexshowstore.com and get entered to win this bad boy.
[02:18:36.510 --> 02:18:38.209]  Please stand by for further details.
[02:18:38.610 --> 02:18:40.590]  We return you now to your regularly scheduled program.
[02:18:42.329 --> 02:18:47.250]  Rising from the ashes of censorship, it's Alex Jones.
[02:18:47.489 --> 02:18:52.989]  All of us together are gonna lift the curse off of this country and we're gonna send the globalists to prison!
[02:18:54.190 --> 02:18:57.250]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:18:57.530 --> 02:19:01.069]  First they come for Alex Jones, and then they're gonna come for us.
[02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:04.450]  And they try to bankrupt Alex Jones or try to put Alex Jones in prison.
[02:19:04.610 --> 02:19:11.430]  The demonization of Alex Jones should be of profound interest to everybody all across the board, even progressives.
[02:19:11.610 --> 02:19:13.129]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:19:13.309 --> 02:19:16.250]  Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago.
[02:19:16.469 --> 02:19:16.930]  Listen!
[02:19:17.229 --> 02:19:22.870]  I don't know how all this is gonna end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one!
[02:19:29.389 --> 02:19:34.030]  The Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.
[02:19:37.850 --> 02:19:44.329]  Alright, I've got a lot of really important news that isn't directly World War III and the escalation there I want to hit.
[02:19:44.530 --> 02:19:50.129]  So I'm going to race through the calls we've got here, and then I'm going to get into all of that into the next hour.
[02:19:50.770 --> 02:19:52.629]  And this is really important stuff.
[02:19:52.770 --> 02:19:56.270]  Some of that I've hit a little bit on, but I've got to get to this.
[02:19:57.309 --> 02:20:00.129]  And man, the good nominations...
[02:20:00.829 --> 02:20:03.510]  I mean, you know RFK Jr. is behind these.
[02:20:03.610 --> 02:20:04.670]  This is some good stuff.
[02:20:06.450 --> 02:20:08.370]  Gay Whale was in that as a bad example.
[02:20:08.909 --> 02:20:10.709]  But I mean, Gay Whale's not the worst.
[02:20:10.989 --> 02:20:11.270]  Gorka.
[02:20:12.030 --> 02:20:12.809]  He wasn't even...
[02:20:12.809 --> 02:20:15.629]  Again, I wasn't even going to talk about him until a caller called in about him.
[02:20:16.750 --> 02:20:19.149]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ivan in Illinois.
[02:20:19.430 --> 02:20:20.090]  Ivan, thanks for calling.
[02:20:20.170 --> 02:20:20.389]  Go ahead.
[02:20:21.770 --> 02:20:22.409]  Hey, Alex.
[02:20:22.610 --> 02:20:23.430]  How's it going, man?
[02:20:23.549 --> 02:20:25.450]  Long-time listener, supporter, you know.
[02:20:25.870 --> 02:20:30.930]  I just want to let you know that, you know, I'm always 1,000% behind you in everything you do.
[02:20:31.309 --> 02:20:36.250]  And I'm out here trying to help, you know, spread out the message and just kind of get everyone to wake up, you know.
[02:20:36.450 --> 02:20:43.530]  It's kind of a hard thing to do just because, you know, so many people are bogged on with, you know, their daily jobs and tasks and all that.
[02:20:43.809 --> 02:20:46.469]  But, you know, I'm out here doing it.
[02:20:46.590 --> 02:20:49.170]  And, you know, I just wanted to talk to you about...
[02:20:49.879 --> 02:21:05.159]  You know, your recent interview you just did with the Dark Journalist, and you guys were talking about the UAP activity in relation to, like, World War III. And, you know, in my opinion, and I think a lot of us here in the UAP community,
[02:21:05.540 --> 02:21:15.520]  you know, I think a lot of us kind of disagree that it isn't just, you know, it's not just human or breakaway civilization that's probably behind these UAPs.
[02:21:16.190 --> 02:21:24.370]  You know, I think a lot of us, you know, are with the school of thought that these are actually being controlled or piloted by non-human intelligence.
[02:21:25.569 --> 02:21:40.389]  And, you know, I would like to, you know, maybe see, you know, if you could one day get maybe David Grush, Lou Elizondo, or George Knapp on the show just so they can kind of, like, get their side of the story out there to some of your listeners.
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:51.420]  I mean, I know you kind of have your, like, school of thought on it and what it is, you know, but we're all just waiting to kind of find out, you know, because we got this huge revelation coming up in front of us, you know, we just had those...
[02:21:51.420 --> 02:21:53.840]  Well, I mean, on several Apollo missions, it's the official...
[02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:12.399]  I'm saying these videos we see of the drone swarms at bases and the stuff flying around in Manhattan last week and these big flying V's, those are human aircraft.
[02:22:12.399 --> 02:22:15.899]  We even know the code names for them.
[02:22:16.120 --> 02:22:17.159]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:22:18.289 --> 02:22:18.569]  Okay.
[02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:21.809]  Yeah, man, you know, and we all want to get to the truth, too.
[02:22:21.969 --> 02:22:31.030]  You know, we want to see how this is all connected with each other, with the globalists, you know, if they are going to try and, like, pull, like, some type of, like, fake alien invasion to bring in the New World Order, you know.
[02:22:31.209 --> 02:22:34.770]  It's just interesting that it's all kind of, like, happening now, you know, simultaneously.
[02:22:34.969 --> 02:22:36.250]  What are your thoughts on that?
[02:22:36.530 --> 02:22:37.350]  No, I agree.
[02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:39.629]  And I think that's because most of it's human.
[02:22:39.750 --> 02:22:41.209]  I'm not saying some of it could be something else.
[02:22:41.329 --> 02:22:43.049]  And the ancients talked about that.
[02:22:43.170 --> 02:22:44.950]  I mean, it's the same stories around the world.
[02:22:45.489 --> 02:22:47.530]  Human populations didn't have any connection to each other.
[02:22:47.690 --> 02:22:50.190]  So, yeah, I mean, I'll get a bunch of those guests on.
[02:22:50.309 --> 02:22:55.250]  I mean, I've had some of those guests on over the years that do think it's extraterrestrial.
[02:22:56.010 --> 02:22:56.870]  So, very interesting.
[02:22:57.170 --> 02:22:57.969]  Ivan, thanks for the call.
[02:22:58.690 --> 02:23:00.250]  Steven in California, you're on the air.
[02:23:00.329 --> 02:23:00.610]  Go ahead.
[02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:02.350]  Yes, sir.
[02:23:02.770 --> 02:23:03.809]  How are you, Alex?
[02:23:03.989 --> 02:23:04.690]  I'm doing all right, brother.
[02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:05.450]  It's the day before Thanksgiving.
[02:23:05.450 --> 02:23:06.670]  We're here trying to stop nuclear war.
[02:23:07.270 --> 02:23:09.709]  Oh, dude, I got so much thanks to give to you.
[02:23:09.790 --> 02:23:11.729]  And I want to circle back around on that.
[02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:12.370]  Ha ha ha.
[02:23:12.809 --> 02:23:16.530]  I have so much thanks to give to you for humanity, right?
[02:23:16.709 --> 02:23:18.370]  And we can get back to that, right?
[02:23:18.809 --> 02:23:20.170]  That's not what's important.
[02:23:20.270 --> 02:23:21.670]  It's not about you and you know that.
[02:23:21.850 --> 02:23:24.309]  Your intuition is deeper than anybody's.
[02:23:24.469 --> 02:23:26.190]  We know that, right?
[02:23:26.530 --> 02:23:27.870]  You are the tip of the spear.
[02:23:28.709 --> 02:23:34.489]  But I want to talk about how to prevent, end World War III and World War IV, right?
[02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:36.510]  And put an end to this stuff.
[02:23:37.370 --> 02:23:38.750]  And I know who's listening.
[02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:39.629]  Everybody's listening.
[02:23:39.770 --> 02:23:41.709]  Everybody's going to hear what we're talking about right now.
[02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:43.729]  I'm not just speaking with you, right?
[02:23:44.290 --> 02:23:45.950]  So VP is listening.
[02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:48.569]  DJT is listening.
[02:23:49.610 --> 02:23:50.450]  Everybody's listening.
[02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:53.690]  I wouldn't say they're always listening, but they hear a lot of what we say.
[02:23:54.110 --> 02:23:55.430]  They're going to hear about this.
[02:23:55.450 --> 02:23:56.549]  I can promise you that, brother.
[02:23:56.610 --> 02:23:57.229]  Well, go ahead and tell us.
[02:23:58.820 --> 02:24:02.340]  So, why is GS running around breathing?
[02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:05.000]  Why is KS running around breathing?
[02:24:05.420 --> 02:24:11.819]  And why is BG going around, running around breathing, trying to kill us?
[02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:16.379]  I know that Vladimir knows.
[02:24:16.500 --> 02:24:18.180]  I know that she knows.
[02:24:18.180 --> 02:24:19.959]  And I know that Donald J. Trump knows.
[02:24:20.479 --> 02:24:22.459]  They're standing back and standing by.
[02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:25.739]  And all we have to do is, what, another 57 days?
[02:24:26.950 --> 02:24:30.389]  You know, they have Christ in their heart, right?
[02:24:31.209 --> 02:24:33.389]  These people, cream rises to the top.
[02:24:33.610 --> 02:24:35.430]  Cream rises to the top in every country.
[02:24:35.870 --> 02:24:39.750]  I'd love to speak about 40, 50, 60, 100 things with you, Alex.
[02:24:39.889 --> 02:24:43.729]  I want to be succinct in the interest of everybody's time.
[02:24:44.350 --> 02:24:49.510]  But I'm sending a message not just to you, but to the world and to the Russian people.
[02:24:49.649 --> 02:24:50.270]  We love you.
[02:24:50.430 --> 02:24:51.670]  I love Russian women.
[02:24:51.809 --> 02:24:52.450]  They're so beautiful.
[02:24:52.690 --> 02:24:55.610]  And the Russian people are amazing.
[02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:56.909]  America loves you.
[02:24:57.030 --> 02:24:58.930]  And we know that you love us, too.
[02:24:59.209 --> 02:25:01.709]  And let's just stand back and stand by.
[02:25:01.989 --> 02:25:08.190]  And you were asking why Trump hasn't said something about stopping this stuff.
[02:25:08.350 --> 02:25:09.709]  It's because they're trying to trap him.
[02:25:09.790 --> 02:25:10.590]  They're trying to bait him.
[02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.870]  You know?
[02:25:12.049 --> 02:25:13.569]  They're trying to bait him with this...
[02:25:15.090 --> 02:25:17.569]  Whatever the Logan Act, right?
[02:25:18.209 --> 02:25:19.530]  He's not falling for it.
[02:25:19.649 --> 02:25:20.829]  Putin's not falling for it.
[02:25:20.889 --> 02:25:22.450]  She's not falling for it.
[02:25:22.850 --> 02:25:25.790]  And Alex and Steve are not falling for it.
[02:25:25.909 --> 02:25:27.250]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[02:25:30.989 --> 02:25:34.250]  Last week, I told Roger Stone we need Trump to go public with this.
[02:25:34.290 --> 02:25:35.370]  He said, well, maybe the Logan Act.
[02:25:35.790 --> 02:25:36.870]  I checked the law.
[02:25:36.950 --> 02:25:37.409]  I already knew it.
[02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:38.510]  General Flynn knows it.
[02:25:39.350 --> 02:25:40.809]  And President-elect...
[02:25:44.270 --> 02:25:49.850]  100% legally and lawfully can engage in discussions with other world leaders.
[02:25:50.329 --> 02:25:55.829]  The president's usually on the elect to go meet with world leaders in a trip right around this time.
[02:25:56.190 --> 02:26:00.870]  So stand by at the ready and all that Q stuff.
[02:26:01.889 --> 02:26:05.069]  I saw a guy comment on one of my ex-accounts a couple days ago.
[02:26:05.450 --> 02:26:07.170]  He goes, look, Q's real.
[02:26:11.950 --> 02:26:16.409]  Elon Musk said, You are the media now.
[02:26:16.649 --> 02:26:19.049]  Well, I mean, Matt Drudge said that 25 years ago.
[02:26:19.190 --> 02:26:20.489]  I said that 20 years ago.
[02:26:21.250 --> 02:26:22.690]  Everybody's always said, be the media.
[02:26:25.250 --> 02:26:29.090]  Marshall McLuhan, Church of the Subgenius, said that 50 years ago.
[02:26:31.370 --> 02:26:32.670]  I think that's the first time I ever read that.
[02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:37.090]  It was like 35 years ago, reading one of his, I think it was Church of the Subgenius book.
[02:26:38.129 --> 02:26:41.969]  So, and you know, he also said 15 minutes of fame and all that.
[02:26:42.049 --> 02:26:42.950]  I really have 50 minutes of fame.
[02:26:43.250 --> 02:26:45.329]  I mean, that's where all this is going.
[02:26:46.510 --> 02:26:50.229]  So, I hear like, Q said the Federal Reserve is private.
[02:26:50.389 --> 02:26:51.229]  Alex Jones said it.
[02:26:51.370 --> 02:26:54.729]  Well, I mean, senators said it back at the time.
[02:26:55.010 --> 02:26:59.370]  It's this thing like, the whole anti-New World Order movement is this Q thing.
[02:27:00.510 --> 02:27:03.229]  And then just, you know, trust the plan and all this stuff.
[02:27:04.090 --> 02:27:06.049]  And I just, you know, no, no.
[02:27:06.590 --> 02:27:08.110]  The earlier caller nailed it.
[02:27:08.530 --> 02:27:11.690]  Trump's got the military industrial complex trying to misrepresent anything he says.
[02:27:14.290 --> 02:27:20.889]  He's trying to get his peace deals in front so that he gets such a momentum they can't stop him.
[02:27:21.770 --> 02:27:26.590]  You know, remember the Q people, you know, Trump's going to get inaugurated on the 20th of July.
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:34.040]  Of January 2021, and Biden's going to be sent to Gitmo, and Hillary's a Gitmo, and just none of that.
[02:27:34.219 --> 02:27:35.200]  Old Q didn't say that.
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:37.500]  Yeah, the whole people running around saying that did.
[02:27:38.879 --> 02:27:40.639]  Okay, so...
[02:27:40.639 --> 02:27:43.340]  I know Trump well.
[02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:44.600]  I know the stuff going on.
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:44.920]  Okay?
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:46.879]  Trump's smart.
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:48.059]  Trump's a good guy.
[02:27:48.799 --> 02:27:55.340]  But him nominating Matt Gaetz wasn't 3D chess, so he would then be the U.S. senator from Florida.
[02:27:55.340 --> 02:27:55.719]  Okay?
[02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:01.899]  I knew privately people I talked to, they said, Trump just likes Gates.
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:02.979]  This is not going to go well.
[02:28:04.959 --> 02:28:06.200]  And then I saw the Q stuff.
[02:28:06.319 --> 02:28:08.540]  Oh God, it's 3DS. No, it's not.
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:15.440]  So, when we lose and bad stuff happens to us, it's not a plan to do that.
[02:28:15.659 --> 02:28:18.659]  Trump didn't plan to have the election stolen four years ago from him.
[02:28:18.959 --> 02:28:22.299]  He didn't plan to have him come after him criminally and then expose them.
[02:28:22.719 --> 02:28:29.120]  But the way the world works, though, when you engage corruption and you keep fighting and you're in the right, people do end up joining you.
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:30.959]  But that's human nature in the world.
[02:28:32.239 --> 02:28:39.100]  And so as these masses of unpolitical people begin to wake up, they don't have all the history or the data to know what's real and what's not.
[02:28:39.479 --> 02:28:49.299]  And then people create this esoteric stuff, like people that see the Virgin Mary on a piece of burnt toast, or, you know, giraffes in the clouds or whatever.
[02:28:49.459 --> 02:28:50.879]  And I get it.
[02:28:51.340 --> 02:28:53.100]  That's going to happen when a bunch of people...
[02:28:57.319 --> 02:29:02.440]  Who believe whatever they're told in the past, now know they've been lied to, then they don't believe anything.
[02:29:02.639 --> 02:29:03.920]  They think the world is flat.
[02:29:04.799 --> 02:29:11.719]  They think, you know, cathedrals in the United States are 5,000 years old.
[02:29:11.860 --> 02:29:12.360]  No, they're not.
[02:29:17.239 --> 02:29:18.219]  It's scary.
[02:29:19.299 --> 02:29:28.420]  So you got a lot of crazy leftists out there, blew it on, and then you've got other people Who aren't bad.
[02:29:29.659 --> 02:29:31.059]  A lot of them are my friends.
[02:29:31.239 --> 02:29:32.059]  And they're hilarious.
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:35.780]  But I just don't know what to say.
[02:29:36.700 --> 02:29:36.940]  Okay?
[02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:42.319]  Trump's doing the best job he can.
[02:29:42.399 --> 02:29:42.920]  He's a good guy.
[02:29:44.319 --> 02:29:45.280]  But he's not God.
[02:29:48.239 --> 02:29:51.159]  And JFK Jr.'s dead.
[02:29:53.059 --> 02:29:56.620]  They showed up by the thousands of years ago at Dealey Plaza Dallas to meet with him.
[02:29:58.590 --> 02:29:59.909]  It's mass schizophrenia.
[02:30:01.649 --> 02:30:03.469]  Let's talk to Thomas in Texas.
[02:30:03.690 --> 02:30:04.389]  You're on the air, Thomas.
[02:30:04.549 --> 02:30:04.850]  Go ahead.
[02:30:06.170 --> 02:30:06.750]  Hi, Alex.
[02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:08.069]  Welcome.
[02:30:08.909 --> 02:30:09.709]  How are you today?
[02:30:09.930 --> 02:30:10.250]  I'm all right.
[02:30:10.309 --> 02:30:10.530]  Go ahead.
[02:30:12.049 --> 02:30:17.270]  So, I just want to make this brief, and I want to discuss this from a historical perspective.
[02:30:18.360 --> 02:30:23.700]  On how to resolve this World War III issue, and I want to discuss this from the legal perspective.
[02:30:24.059 --> 02:30:37.079]  So from the historical perspective, you read the works of Suetonius, you read Hitler-Meinkopf, you find that guys like this, people like this, Number one, you're absolutely correct.
[02:30:37.459 --> 02:30:39.219]  You do have to confront them.
[02:30:39.340 --> 02:30:40.700]  You do have to put them down.
[02:30:41.239 --> 02:30:42.860]  Otherwise, they will continue.
[02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:51.280]  It's always been the policy in cases like treason and sedition, historically, that the death penalty was the sentence.
[02:30:52.040 --> 02:30:58.120]  However, we do have a much different framework, an experimental framework, if you want to call it.
[02:30:58.520 --> 02:31:00.879]  It's the first great idea in history.
[02:31:01.399 --> 02:31:03.559]  We have laws pertaining to this.
[02:31:03.719 --> 02:31:26.479]  So when you look at Article 6 of the Constitution, U.S. Code 53331, which talks about oaths, you look at U.S. 182381, you know, first of all, you have an oath and obligation and a duty to If I was still in the military and I had a commanding officer doing these things,
[02:31:26.719 --> 02:31:28.399]  I would get the good men around me.
[02:31:28.540 --> 02:31:33.360]  And if we were all in agreement, then, of course, we would go ahead and arrest him.
[02:31:34.399 --> 02:31:36.819]  And then, of course, this would end up in a court-martial.
[02:31:37.020 --> 02:31:42.420]  And then, you know, in a perfect world, they would agree.
[02:31:42.739 --> 02:31:48.219]  You would look at the UCMJ. However, courts are about procedure and precedent.
[02:31:49.139 --> 02:31:51.959]  And procedurally courts are everything, right?
[02:31:52.159 --> 02:31:57.459]  So I've looked at the evidence in the Senate hearings.
[02:31:57.639 --> 02:31:58.979]  There's no question.
[02:31:59.139 --> 02:32:04.079]  2024 and 2020. So 2020 was stolen.
[02:32:04.959 --> 02:32:06.979]  He is not legitimate.
[02:32:07.700 --> 02:32:17.520]  This has been treated like he is a legitimate entity in government, but he is a stolen entity, so therefore he is an imposter.
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:24.420]  So when you steal the presidency of the United States, you don't get the benefits of immunity.
[02:32:24.680 --> 02:32:28.319]  We've been running around calling this guy president, treating him like he's legit.
[02:32:28.600 --> 02:32:29.319]  He's not.
[02:32:29.540 --> 02:32:30.899]  The evidence is very clear.
[02:32:30.959 --> 02:32:31.920]  And let me back you up.
[02:32:33.290 --> 02:32:48.329]  Then when they disappear him and put out a fake letter that he resigned that Pelosi admits is fake to cover her ass, because she doesn't know who did it, and it's fake, and he disappears for eight days, and then Kamala is selected with not one vote in the primaries.
[02:32:49.530 --> 02:33:04.299]  Like Dana White said over a month ago, he said, there's been a coup, they're going to try to steal it and continue it on, and now they've got this time when President Trump's president-elect to try to create another big crisis, which they're doing, bombing the snot out of Russia, It's just a clear and present danger.
[02:33:05.020 --> 02:33:07.479]  I've been trying to get this information to Trump.
[02:33:07.479 --> 02:33:08.899]  I've tried it every which way.
[02:33:09.040 --> 02:33:10.520]  So this is going out to Trump.
[02:33:10.760 --> 02:33:16.639]  So first of all, if I was in the military, I would hang my hat on these laws.
[02:33:17.219 --> 02:33:25.059]  Number two, I would get the good men around me, and if at all possible, they have to be put under arrest.
[02:33:25.459 --> 02:33:30.340]  If the DOJ is so compromised they can't do their job, I would direct your attention to Texas.
[02:33:30.659 --> 02:33:33.520]  Texas upholds the right of revolution.
[02:33:33.819 --> 02:33:39.579]  You have the word abolish in our Declaration of Independence, which is very similar to the word demolish.
[02:33:39.700 --> 02:33:44.000]  And just for reference here, it is a violent term, okay?
[02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:51.739]  And in most cases, in all cases actually that I've read about historically, it's always ended up in a firefight, but we have a different framework.
[02:33:51.979 --> 02:33:55.829]  So rightfully, You know, she would have the right.
[02:33:56.069 --> 02:33:57.389]  They are not immune.
[02:33:57.930 --> 02:33:59.250]  Listen, I gotta go.
[02:33:59.510 --> 02:34:00.409]  I appreciate your call.
[02:34:00.850 --> 02:34:01.170]  Listen.
[02:34:02.829 --> 02:34:06.670]  Yeah, and New Hampshire has right to revolt in their constitution too.
[02:34:06.770 --> 02:34:09.389]  Okay, that's the Declaration of Independence you're talking about.
[02:34:09.610 --> 02:34:11.229]  It doesn't give us the right, it points it out.
[02:34:11.750 --> 02:34:16.409]  It's not our right, it's our duty when we have tyrannical governments to abolish it and make a better form of government for ourselves.
[02:34:18.110 --> 02:34:24.569]  Trump has been elected in a landslide, popular vote, and in the Electoral College.
[02:34:25.010 --> 02:34:26.750]  He's got to thread the needle here.
[02:34:26.750 --> 02:34:28.290]  I don't want the military.
[02:34:28.290 --> 02:34:29.969]  I don't want mass arrest.
[02:34:31.850 --> 02:34:34.649]  They could get a civil war going with that.
[02:34:35.129 --> 02:34:48.819]  He needs to use the power of information war with the truth To expose its illegitimate, to say they're trying to start World War III ahead of him getting in, to politically annihilate them, and to cut them off at the knees.
[02:34:49.239 --> 02:34:49.799]  All right?
[02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:58.500]  Now, I'm not going to argue with you and say that historically the tyranny we've seen, yeah, I can see how people could say they have the right to physically do something.
[02:34:59.639 --> 02:35:01.780]  But the world is complex.
[02:35:01.780 --> 02:35:04.620]  The general public is still not very well informed that they're waking up.
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:07.459]  That is the most dangerous scenario.
[02:35:07.719 --> 02:35:10.260]  And don't worry, the deep shell will probably blow something up and get that going anyways.
[02:35:12.299 --> 02:35:14.260]  So, I am not calling.
[02:35:15.260 --> 02:35:18.200]  I mean, the military is globalist right now.
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:26.979]  They're already trying to say Trump is unlawful and about to give you legal orders that aren't to try to organize something against him, which then kind of makes your point, well, then Trump better move against them.
[02:35:27.059 --> 02:35:28.579]  Yeah, we are in a lot of trouble.
[02:35:28.719 --> 02:35:30.879]  I mean, we're in a very dangerous situation.
[02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:34.780]  The crazy people we have running things are talking about giving nuclear weapons to Ukraine.
[02:35:34.920 --> 02:35:36.659]  They're bombing Russia with heavy missiles.
[02:35:37.559 --> 02:35:45.600]  The NATO military committee, headed up by Admiral Bauer, came out two days ago and said, maybe we should just sneak attack Russia to try to provocate.
[02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:59.059]  Well, then we need to have Trump call for de-escalation and point out how crazy that is, like his new national security advisor is, Congressman Walz, and like General Kellogg has done, now nominated to be the peace envoy.
[02:35:59.989 --> 02:36:00.389]  Good.
[02:36:00.649 --> 02:36:01.409]  That's good.
[02:36:02.569 --> 02:36:04.409]  But we need the big guy up there.
[02:36:04.850 --> 02:36:08.370]  I mean, the whole world will be locked on what he's saying.
[02:36:08.409 --> 02:36:10.170]  It won't lessen when he gets the peace deal.
[02:36:10.250 --> 02:36:11.170]  It will hasten it.
[02:36:11.950 --> 02:36:13.709]  I don't see any way that's wrong.
[02:36:14.329 --> 02:36:17.010]  And that's what opened the phones up and asked the callers about that.
[02:36:17.290 --> 02:36:18.090]  What do you think?
[02:36:18.149 --> 02:36:19.790]  And we had one caller disagree with me.
[02:36:20.190 --> 02:36:22.549]  Most of the callers agree with me that would bring up the topic.
[02:36:22.909 --> 02:36:30.819]  Instead, we've gotten lots of talk about, you know, Oh, we've got them trapped, and it's a master plan.
[02:36:31.379 --> 02:36:32.319]  Now, we're in a lot of trouble.
[02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:34.540]  But we do have the initiative of returning the time.
[02:36:34.739 --> 02:36:35.680]  But it's hard.
[02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:41.659]  Well, first and foremost, people should pray for peace and justice.
[02:36:43.459 --> 02:36:44.959]  Mike in Texas, thanks for calling.
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:45.299]  Go ahead.
[02:36:46.620 --> 02:36:47.500]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:55.100]  It was a privilege to meet you at that last bankruptcy hearing in front of Judge Lopez.
[02:36:56.159 --> 02:36:57.280]  A few weeks ago.
[02:36:58.520 --> 02:37:00.860]  Finally, after many years of listening.
[02:37:01.079 --> 02:37:01.559]  Great to meet you.
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:04.799]  You've been calling in, what, 25 years?
[02:37:06.239 --> 02:37:07.920]  Yeah, at least it seems.
[02:37:09.399 --> 02:37:24.620]  You asked a question earlier, probably on behalf of callers, why hasn't Trump, you know, gone public with his discussions with Putin, whatever,
[02:37:25.740 --> 02:37:36.879]  I think he's afraid of falling into the same trap that caught him in his first term, which was, you know, he's...
[02:37:36.879 --> 02:37:38.559]  Well, I don't think you're wrong.
[02:37:38.559 --> 02:37:43.600]  I know you're right, which shows he's still intimidated by the New York Times that has no power.
[02:37:43.739 --> 02:37:45.579]  He needs to say, hell yes, I'm talking to Putin.
[02:37:45.639 --> 02:37:46.659]  Hell yes, this is wrong.
[02:37:46.799 --> 02:37:47.920]  He needs to own it.
[02:37:49.229 --> 02:37:50.149]  Exactly, yeah.
[02:37:50.950 --> 02:38:04.600]  If they did that, it would boomerang on them, and it would give him a chance to To flesh out what's really going on, because a lot of people, as your other callers have pointed out, simply aren't aware of where we are.
[02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:07.739]  Mike, let's just go further.
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:08.479]  You're dead on.
[02:38:08.940 --> 02:38:11.200]  He's got a bunch of advisors saying, be hawkish.
[02:38:11.280 --> 02:38:12.059]  It'll make you popular.
[02:38:12.139 --> 02:38:13.139]  The deep state will leave you alone.
[02:38:14.020 --> 02:38:15.000]  Don't push them.
[02:38:15.219 --> 02:38:17.799]  They can really pull something if you do try to end the war.
[02:38:17.899 --> 02:38:18.639]  Wait until you're president.
[02:38:18.899 --> 02:38:20.299]  I mean, you know that's going on.
[02:38:21.250 --> 02:38:21.530]  Yeah.
[02:38:21.989 --> 02:38:30.809]  Hey, a friend of mine, Sean O'Reilly, has brought up something with me a number of times, and I want to pass it along.
[02:38:32.250 --> 02:38:46.270]  One thing Trump should do, if we can keep him alive until Inauguration Day, fireside chats a la FDR. Just, you know, once a week at least, let the American people know what's going on.
[02:38:46.290 --> 02:38:47.909]  I've been saying that for eight years.
[02:38:48.030 --> 02:38:49.350]  I've been saying that for eight years.
[02:38:50.250 --> 02:38:51.229]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:38:51.409 --> 02:38:52.569]  Well, it's still a great idea.
[02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:53.729]  No, no, no.
[02:38:53.809 --> 02:38:54.469]  I totally agree with you.
[02:38:54.549 --> 02:38:58.850]  But overall, Trump's an enemy of the deep state.
[02:38:58.969 --> 02:38:59.370]  They hate him.
[02:38:59.469 --> 02:39:00.069]  It's totally real.
[02:39:00.250 --> 02:39:00.969]  He's a good man.
[02:39:00.969 --> 02:39:02.069]  He cares about freedom and peace.
[02:39:02.270 --> 02:39:04.010]  I'm just backing him to get him in office.
[02:39:04.690 --> 02:39:12.069]  And again, these mayors calling for violence, the Pentagon trying to say it's illegal for Trump to round up illegals.
[02:39:12.450 --> 02:39:13.549]  None of that's going to work.
[02:39:13.690 --> 02:39:16.870]  I mean, this is a very historic time.
[02:39:17.799 --> 02:39:21.000]  Are you optimistic about the situation right now?
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:26.920]  You know, the other day, I was just about on fire.
[02:39:27.180 --> 02:39:32.459]  I was so angry, and I almost literally couldn't speak.
[02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:42.659]  I can't remember ever being that angry with where we were, with what these lunatics in the Pentagon and D.C., where they brought us.
[02:39:43.399 --> 02:39:58.659]  I personally believe it's because we have all these dual citizens embedded in our government who have motives that are counter to the U.S., but be that as it may, I took a day off and I said,
[02:39:58.899 --> 02:40:02.940]  you know, I'm not doing honor to God.
[02:40:03.459 --> 02:40:05.319]  You know, God's in control.
[02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:18.600]  And, you know, I may think in my conceit that by calling my congressman, you know, the eyepatch McCain or whoever, that I can change things.
[02:40:18.739 --> 02:40:28.860]  But, you know, I just need, you know, that discussion, especially the discussion with the dark journalist, just blew me away.
[02:40:28.860 --> 02:40:30.299]  And I realized...
[02:40:30.340 --> 02:40:36.200]  It's so far out of my control and even your control that all we can really do is pray.
[02:40:36.379 --> 02:40:36.879]  You're right.
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:38.319]  This is a spiritual war.
[02:40:38.579 --> 02:40:39.920]  Mike, God bless you.
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:41.040]  It was great to meet you in Houston.
[02:40:41.399 --> 02:40:41.840]  Thank you.
[02:40:42.219 --> 02:40:42.440]  All right.
[02:40:42.639 --> 02:40:43.899]  Fourth hour is coming up.
[02:40:45.780 --> 02:40:47.200]  We only got four callers left.
[02:40:47.340 --> 02:40:48.079]  I'm going to get to you.
[02:40:48.280 --> 02:40:49.659]  And then we got some breaking news.
[02:40:49.799 --> 02:40:50.739]  I just overprepared.
[02:40:50.739 --> 02:40:53.479]  I got so much incredible stuff here, but I'm at least mentioned some of it.
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:40:57.600]  But this World War III thing is totally central.
[02:40:57.920 --> 02:40:59.940]  But let me talk about this right now.
[02:41:03.059 --> 02:41:16.770]  We have come out through our great sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, with some amazing products that are low-cost energy gummies, That are high quality and sleep gummies that are high quality.
[02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:23.489]  These are great products that are $14 individually or you can get even better discounts when you order even more.
[02:41:23.709 --> 02:41:26.430]  You're not going to get a great deal on quality products like this anywhere.
[02:41:27.010 --> 02:41:31.969]  And a little bit of profit that comes in on it funds our operation whether Infowars gets shut down or not.
[02:41:32.430 --> 02:41:36.190]  The AlexJonesStore.com is owned by a sponsor so the bad guys can't get it.
[02:41:36.489 --> 02:41:38.690]  Now I asked them for this months ago.
[02:41:38.950 --> 02:41:40.409]  They've developed some really nice ones.
[02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:42.559]  Made right here in America.
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:44.600]  Challenge coins.
[02:41:45.180 --> 02:41:46.340]  Campaign coins.
[02:41:46.639 --> 02:41:47.659]  Like you see in the military.
[02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:50.459]  You've all been in the campaign to restore the republic.
[02:41:50.719 --> 02:41:52.440]  You've all been in the campaign as listeners and viewers.
[02:41:53.020 --> 02:41:54.180]  Supporting the info war.
[02:41:54.520 --> 02:41:56.100]  You've done an amazing job.
[02:41:56.319 --> 02:41:56.840]  So to...
[02:41:57.949 --> 02:42:04.530]  New, limited edition campaign or challenge coins are now available.
[02:42:04.690 --> 02:42:14.069]  The challenge is restore the republic, get Trump into office, defeat the globalists, keep InfoWars on the air, or fund the Alex Jones Network if this gets shut down.
[02:42:14.409 --> 02:42:19.209]  And the campaign is the past campaign that we've all been through in this fight.
[02:42:19.350 --> 02:42:20.030]  So two coins.
[02:42:20.729 --> 02:42:29.409]  The 1776 limited edition coin, when tyranny becomes law, Resistance becomes duty.
[02:42:29.670 --> 02:42:35.250]  On one side, 1776. On the other, don't tread on me with the Gadsden Snake.
[02:42:35.469 --> 02:42:46.909]  AR-15s and 1776. The other coin is the answer to 1984, is 1776. Two great coins.
[02:42:47.229 --> 02:42:50.250]  One of them has an image of me with the bullhorn.
[02:42:50.829 --> 02:42:52.229]  And on the other side...
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:07.739]  We're good to go.
[02:43:08.909 --> 02:43:10.229]  So keep us on the air.
[02:43:10.329 --> 02:43:16.709]  Get your Christmas shopping done early and fight the globalist at thealexjonesstore.com with the new campaign coins.
[02:43:16.969 --> 02:43:23.309]  I am cutting this important announcement right in the middle of the November 5th, 2024 election.
[02:43:23.450 --> 02:43:24.850]  We'll be running this for a week or so.
[02:43:25.030 --> 02:43:30.690]  And it looks like a big Trump win, but they are in full steam ahead with election fraud levels over foreseen.
[02:43:31.389 --> 02:43:46.389]  Regardless of whether we're able to defeat this fraud or not, the awakening And the massive amount of support for Trump and traditional liberals and others waking up and joining us and realizing the Democratic Party ally with the neocons is cancer has been incredible.
[02:43:46.389 --> 02:43:49.110]  And it's part of the larger global realignment happening all over the planet.
[02:43:49.350 --> 02:43:52.389]  But we can't control everything individually.
[02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:54.190]  We can just work towards a better outcome.
[02:43:54.209 --> 02:43:56.030]  And it's a process and we're starting to get traction.
[02:43:56.149 --> 02:43:57.049]  And I've got faith.
[02:43:57.209 --> 02:44:16.040]  But regardless, with all the garbage and all the viruses out there and all the drug resistance and Antibiotic resistant bacteria and crap that's out there, especially in the winter when our immune systems are down, it is so important to boost our body's defenses naturally that God gave us.
[02:44:16.520 --> 02:44:19.920]  Now, if you go to our great sponsor, DrJonesNaturals.com, there's a lot of great products.
[02:44:20.079 --> 02:44:25.239]  And they're key to keeping us on the air if InfoWars is shut down next week, or if we're not shut down, continuing on here.
[02:44:25.479 --> 02:44:27.760]  We try to bring you through our sponsor's amazing products.
[02:44:27.899 --> 02:44:32.040]  Now, we've got two new products at DrJonesNaturals.com that are staples.
[02:44:32.459 --> 02:44:34.139]  That are known and amazing.
[02:44:34.719 --> 02:44:40.440]  And these are high-quality versions of it, the best organic sources and at very, very low prices.
[02:44:40.940 --> 02:44:44.500]  Two new products, introductory price, limited time, 40% off.
[02:44:44.600 --> 02:44:48.840]  And everybody needs quercetin, and everybody needs high-quality CoQ10.
[02:44:49.139 --> 02:44:53.819]  And both of these are high-quality, large doses at a very low price.
[02:44:54.500 --> 02:45:00.600]  Most competing brands, say, of CoQ10 of this quality and this dose, on average are about $60 a bottle.
[02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:05.159]  This is way, way lower than that, and it funds the Infowar.
[02:45:05.299 --> 02:45:09.340]  And then, of course, Quercetin Max, really strong, high-powered Quercetin.
[02:45:09.379 --> 02:45:12.020]  Let me tell you, in case you don't know, what these do.
[02:45:12.579 --> 02:45:19.260]  CoQ10, massive energy production, cellular power, cleaning out the cells, antioxidant properties, heart health.
[02:45:19.260 --> 02:45:20.059]  This is all on record.
[02:45:20.120 --> 02:45:20.639]  This is admitted.
[02:45:21.869 --> 02:45:28.209]  Improved exercise performance, cognitive health, diabetes management, skin health, immune support.
[02:45:28.430 --> 02:45:31.030]  I mean, you just ask chat GPT this and it'll tell you.
[02:45:31.430 --> 02:45:40.229]  Let's look at quercetin, antioxidant properties, immune system support, anti-inflammatory effects, allergy relief, heart health, antiviral and antibacterial properties.
[02:45:40.270 --> 02:45:40.889]  That's the big one.
[02:45:41.389 --> 02:45:48.270]  Supports respiratory health, blood sugar regulation, improves exercise performance, brain health, cognitive, all of it.
[02:45:48.819 --> 02:45:58.899]  So these are amazing known staples that are so good for your body, your immune system, but not just so you have a better chance of not getting ill.
[02:45:59.180 --> 02:46:02.620]  It's the overall general quality of life you're going to have.

[02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:26.120]  And the legal as we keep battling the globalists as they try to shut us down.
[02:46:26.260 --> 02:46:27.700]  So we're going to continue our amazing work.
[02:46:27.799 --> 02:46:28.979]  We cannot do it without your support.

[02:46:58.430 --> 02:47:04.030]  All right, we're into our number four on this Wednesday, November 27th, 2024 transmission.
[02:47:04.969 --> 02:47:06.290]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:47:09.250 --> 02:47:16.469]  I want to address at the bottom of the hour just the breakdown in society of trust in anything.
[02:47:17.229 --> 02:47:26.969]  And just because the corporate media and the globalists have lied to people, it's important for folks to know that there is real science, there is reality in this world, and there's things you can demonstrate for yourself.
[02:47:27.629 --> 02:47:30.889]  So I'm going to talk a little bit about the flat earthers coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:47:31.850 --> 02:47:33.229]  Viva Fry's popping in.
[02:47:33.229 --> 02:47:33.870]  He's a smart...
[02:47:45.070 --> 02:47:49.010]  And also, the whole transgender cult thing is in a lot of trouble.
[02:47:49.129 --> 02:47:50.409]  We got some big developments there.
[02:47:50.770 --> 02:47:54.430]  We're going to talk about with him, but I first wanted to get his take on Trump.
[02:47:55.489 --> 02:47:58.930]  Everybody saw the video that we reposted that went super viral last week.
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:05.620]  I mean, over 130 million views just on my X account of three different clips we put up of it.
[02:48:05.860 --> 02:48:07.219]  People all thought that was new.
[02:48:07.319 --> 02:48:08.420]  I explained it wasn't.
[02:48:09.579 --> 02:48:16.739]  And now here we are, zero statements from Trump about stopping World War III, the bombing of Russia, all of this.
[02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:19.889]  I'm really concerned.
[02:48:19.889 --> 02:48:23.729]  He's putting in Kellogg that is anti-war with Russia.
[02:48:23.729 --> 02:48:24.270]  That's good.
[02:48:24.430 --> 02:48:30.329]  He's got a new National Security Advisor that's been nominated, Waltz, who has come out and said we need to de-escalate.
[02:48:31.010 --> 02:48:39.149]  But I'm really concerned, and you're there in Florida, close to the President, Viva Frye, that We have not seen a statement.
[02:48:39.329 --> 02:48:45.989]  I understand he wants to have a ceasefire deal to announce up front, but he had to go to North Korea just to get that as well.
[02:48:45.989 --> 02:48:48.629]  He had a lot of precursor meetings and statements before then.
[02:48:49.370 --> 02:48:51.930]  So can you think, if you're a smart guy, of any reason...
[02:48:52.850 --> 02:48:56.190]  Especially on the eve of Thanksgiving, why we're not hearing anything from President Trump?
[02:48:56.370 --> 02:49:03.430]  No, I'd like to think that there are discussions going on behind the scenes, and I'm fairly certain that there are, but I have no insider information whatsoever.
[02:49:03.909 --> 02:49:18.930]  That Trump is basically trying to assure the adults in the room who ironically enough at this point in time are Putin and the team to not do anything stupid while this outgoing administration kicks and screams and tries to burn the place down before they leave.
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:40.260]  I don't know.
[02:49:41.110 --> 02:49:45.629]  Old expression, you know, you don't have to tell the truth, but just don't lie.
[02:49:45.950 --> 02:49:54.530]  And so it might be very difficult for Trump to come out and say what's going on, you know, what he thinks of what's going on without being compelled not to discuss what's going on behind the scenes.
[02:49:54.670 --> 02:49:57.649]  So I don't know, but it's concerning.
[02:49:58.709 --> 02:50:01.090]  I mean, we're just relying on Trump.
[02:50:01.639 --> 02:50:08.760]  The so-called villain, Putin, not doing what they are antagonizing him to do almost deliberately.
[02:50:09.280 --> 02:50:12.200]  And so hold your breath for another 50, what is it, 56 days?
[02:50:14.959 --> 02:50:15.360]  Exactly.
[02:50:15.579 --> 02:50:19.139]  I mean, we know he's concerned about the optics of them saying, look, you're talking to the Russians.
[02:50:19.260 --> 02:50:20.879]  That's what a president elect's supposed to do.
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:22.540]  It doesn't violate the Logan Act.
[02:50:23.629 --> 02:50:24.969]  Other presidents have done that.
[02:50:25.209 --> 02:50:33.889]  Hell, when Trump was in for four years, Obama and Kerry ran around behind him trying to sabotage his diplomacy and his policy.
[02:50:34.129 --> 02:50:36.569]  So that's part of it.
[02:50:36.690 --> 02:50:39.389]  Most of it is he wants to get a ceasefire and then be able to announce it.
[02:50:39.510 --> 02:50:41.430]  But Putin has said, we want to deal with Trump.
[02:50:41.909 --> 02:50:42.850]  He's got the mandate.
[02:50:43.010 --> 02:50:43.750]  He's anti-war.
[02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:45.239]  Well, absolutely.
[02:50:45.399 --> 02:50:49.459]  And what will happen, if it plays out the way it should, is the outgoing administration.
[02:50:49.459 --> 02:50:50.819]  It's not even Biden at this point.
[02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:52.579]  He's out in left field.
[02:50:52.700 --> 02:50:55.719]  Kamala Harris is on the post-defeat hangover.
[02:50:56.620 --> 02:51:00.629]  I assure you that Trump, I would imagine, is saying, Putin, just hold off.
[02:51:00.750 --> 02:51:01.629]  Don't do anything stupid.
[02:51:01.770 --> 02:51:06.750]  Let them throw a few attackums inland and think that they're scoring some points.
[02:51:06.850 --> 02:51:09.530]  And when this administration's out, we will come together.
[02:51:09.569 --> 02:51:12.190]  We will sit down and we'll have a peace deal within 24 hours.
[02:51:12.250 --> 02:51:13.049]  I think it will happen.
[02:51:13.129 --> 02:51:15.489]  But they're trying to trigger World War III before it can happen.
[02:51:15.569 --> 02:51:17.709]  So they can then say, look, we warned you about Trump.
[02:51:17.829 --> 02:51:19.850]  He brought in World War III. 100% dead on.
[02:51:19.909 --> 02:51:21.989]  Let's talk about Kamala when we come back in 60 seconds.
[02:51:22.569 --> 02:51:31.979]  Well, Kamala Harris has returned from her three-week long vacation in Hawaii and really reminds us all of how we dodged a bullet.
[02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:44.260]  And I don't say this vitriolically, she's a pathetic puppet the whole time, but she literally looks 20 years older and sounded like she was completely drunk.
[02:51:45.360 --> 02:51:48.120]  And of course the jokes were made when it's 1.30 a.m.
[02:51:48.479 --> 02:51:50.520]  hits and they turn on the lights at the nightclub.
[02:51:51.430 --> 02:51:55.729]  I mean, this is a dramatic situation for her.
[02:51:55.870 --> 02:51:57.069]  Tim Walls has come out.
[02:51:57.709 --> 02:51:58.569]  Tampon Tim.
[02:51:59.209 --> 02:52:05.510]  This just reminds us of the establishment thinking that people would support something like this.
[02:52:05.629 --> 02:52:14.909]  I want to play a short clip of her that they put out last night that is just stunning and pathetic.
[02:52:16.340 --> 02:52:22.719]  And it just reminds us that we've been intimidated and bullied by these people to bow to them and they'll call us names.
[02:52:22.899 --> 02:52:24.680]  It's an honor to be attacked by these people.
[02:52:25.040 --> 02:52:25.959]  Here she is.
[02:52:27.180 --> 02:52:33.340]  I just have to remind you, don't you ever let anybody take your power from you.
[02:52:34.360 --> 02:52:39.200]  You have the same power that you did before November 5th.
[02:52:39.840 --> 02:52:43.040]  And you have the same purpose that you did.
[02:52:44.620 --> 02:52:50.079]  And you have the same ability to engage and inspire.
[02:52:50.719 --> 02:52:55.420]  So don't ever let anybody or any circumstance take your power from you.
[02:52:56.959 --> 02:52:57.799]  She looks.
[02:52:58.239 --> 02:53:00.959]  I mean, Alex, I feel bad.
[02:53:01.079 --> 02:53:04.100]  I mean, I have been accused of being the sissy Canadian.
[02:53:04.399 --> 02:53:05.639]  I've hit the memes.
[02:53:05.899 --> 02:53:11.239]  I feel bad because on the one hand, alcoholism is a thing and people can't control themselves.
[02:53:11.360 --> 02:53:11.979]  It ruins lives.
[02:53:12.770 --> 02:53:16.770]  Flip side, she was the most detestable candidate ever.
[02:53:16.969 --> 02:53:24.489]  She was nothing but a mirage that the media repackaged, reframed, and wouldn't let speak on her own so that they could maintain that image.
[02:53:24.670 --> 02:53:29.950]  The way she said, she was clearly on something.
[02:53:30.290 --> 02:53:33.290]  And I don't know if it's alcohol, meds, whatever.
[02:53:33.809 --> 02:53:36.409]  But who the hell lets her do that?
[02:53:36.590 --> 02:53:42.409]  I found that it's a full 10-minute video where she's doing a call with someone, I don't know who it is, and Tim Walls pops on.
[02:53:43.030 --> 02:53:46.270]  That they let her do that in that state is wild.
[02:53:46.590 --> 02:53:52.329]  And then they try to snip and clip to find a portion of it that's not an utter embarrassment.
[02:53:52.590 --> 02:53:53.190]  No, you're right.
[02:53:53.270 --> 02:53:55.610]  I mean, she's clearly and reportedly does drink vodka.
[02:53:55.809 --> 02:53:57.569]  And Lord knows I have before too.
[02:53:57.870 --> 02:53:59.930]  She's a fifth in or more.
[02:54:00.069 --> 02:54:00.790]  I mean, she's hammered.
[02:54:00.950 --> 02:54:08.819]  It's not, and look, I've done a We're good to go.
[02:54:30.190 --> 02:54:32.250]  But no, she's clearly got a problem.
[02:54:32.270 --> 02:54:38.950]  But bottom line, they tried to polish that turd, that proverbial turd, and pass her off as a presidential candidate.
[02:54:39.149 --> 02:54:49.690]  And they would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids on X, on your channel, the independent media on Bongino, who revealed to the world what she actually is beyond the repackaging and the rebranding.
[02:54:50.950 --> 02:54:52.709]  No, I totally agree with you.
[02:54:53.670 --> 02:54:54.149]  But...
[02:54:55.389 --> 02:54:59.510]  Pulling back from this, and I don't bring up my own case, because it's my case.
[02:54:59.629 --> 02:55:04.270]  If this was happening to Joe Rogan or Tucker Carlson or anybody, I'd be concerned.
[02:55:04.450 --> 02:55:06.010]  And I know I've been following some of your work.
[02:55:06.049 --> 02:55:08.409]  You've now seen the documents in our lawsuit that are their documents.
[02:55:08.809 --> 02:55:12.290]  Just emblematically of the deep state, still law-faring.
[02:55:12.889 --> 02:55:19.290]  And then two weeks ago, plus, the world's toll were closed on November 14th.
[02:55:20.620 --> 02:55:24.680]  And we weren't closed, and I told everybody we were back in the building 24 hours later.
[02:55:24.959 --> 02:55:27.459]  They just cut the internet off, so I couldn't do the show here.
[02:55:27.500 --> 02:55:38.899]  I went to the backup studios, the Alex Jones Network, follow us at AJN Live on X. You know, Musk has come into the case, has to, because they'll take everybody's X accounts with this.
[02:55:39.639 --> 02:55:41.540]  That's the rules that the other social media have.
[02:55:41.620 --> 02:55:45.100]  Of course, X owns that and gives you a license while you're there.
[02:55:45.260 --> 02:55:55.139]  I mean, Musk had to come into that, but he's also said some nice things and said what's happening to us is wrong and has created a place that's got more free speech anywhere else other than Rumble, where we're both at.
[02:55:55.479 --> 02:56:05.049]  So Rumble's awesome, so is X. But just a snapshot of that and this climate, And of course, people don't know that they've been lying in court.
[02:56:05.250 --> 02:56:15.430]  I mean, they had the U.S. trustee get up a few weeks ago at the first emergency hearing and say he didn't know what the bid from The Onion, that's really Michael Bloomberg's Everytown group, but he did.
[02:56:15.430 --> 02:56:19.909]  And he did want to tell the judge that it was this made-up fiat currency or the key currency.
[02:56:21.069 --> 02:56:23.489]  It's in the documents we filed in my lawsuit a week and a half ago.
[02:56:24.069 --> 02:56:31.549]  They say in there to the bidder I was working with, who followed the rules totally, wouldn't even tell me what he was bidding, but I'd worked with him for years.
[02:56:31.610 --> 02:56:37.030]  I said, yeah, if you take it over and I have free speech, you know, and a new company owns it, I would work for you to keep the crew hired and everything.
[02:56:37.129 --> 02:56:37.909]  That was my only thing.
[02:56:38.010 --> 02:56:39.110]  We had an employment contract.
[02:56:39.110 --> 02:56:40.750]  We gave it to Chris Murray, the U.S. trustee.
[02:56:41.190 --> 02:56:42.909]  Now they're trying to act like that's bad or something.
[02:56:43.129 --> 02:56:44.489]  So we disclosed everything.
[02:56:44.629 --> 02:56:46.569]  I didn't even know what they were doing in the bidding.
[02:56:46.829 --> 02:56:48.829]  I just said I would work with them in an employment contract.
[02:56:49.510 --> 02:56:51.909]  And then they gave them two days before they changed.
[02:56:52.010 --> 02:56:53.069]  It's not a public auction.
[02:56:53.270 --> 02:56:54.149]  This is all in their documents.
[02:56:54.530 --> 02:56:55.010]  Their documents.
[02:56:55.809 --> 02:56:57.090]  Gave them, I'll shut up in a minute.
[02:56:57.170 --> 02:56:57.950]  I'm just giving people the basics.
[02:56:58.670 --> 02:57:03.549]  New rules on November 11th for the 13th that said, now it's not the highest bidder.
[02:57:03.649 --> 02:57:04.729]  It's not going to be a public bid.
[02:57:04.829 --> 02:57:05.889]  We'll take a lower bid if we want.
[02:57:06.049 --> 02:57:09.010]  Oh, and you can't use derivatives or formulas or credit.
[02:57:09.329 --> 02:57:18.729]  And then said, but we chose to let the other side use credit and didn't give the folks I was working with the bidding information until that Thursday evening on the 14th that was...
[02:57:19.299 --> 02:57:20.139]  A confession.
[02:57:20.659 --> 02:57:24.940]  The analogy is like killers that videotape themselves butchering people or something.
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:25.700]  I'm not saying they did that.
[02:57:25.780 --> 02:57:26.579]  I'm saying it's similar.
[02:57:27.020 --> 02:57:28.399]  Cops are like, why did you videotape?
[02:57:28.459 --> 02:57:30.180]  Well, I like to have it on film.
[02:57:30.520 --> 02:57:32.139]  So it's open and shut.
[02:57:32.659 --> 02:57:39.760]  And when the evidentiary hearing comes up on the 9th of December, I mean, my lawyers are good lawyers.
[02:57:40.710 --> 02:57:49.389]  And well-known, respected bankruptcy lawyers, they told the judge in the hearing two days ago, they said, Your Honor, Shelby Jordan's been practicing 45 years.
[02:57:49.530 --> 02:57:52.010]  I mean, he's done bankruptcies for $10 million companies.
[02:57:52.329 --> 02:57:54.590]  He said, Sir, I've never seen this.
[02:57:54.889 --> 02:57:59.090]  Neither has Walter Sissak, also a very respected top bankruptcy lawyer.
[02:57:59.549 --> 02:58:01.729]  He says, Your Honor, I don't know what to say.
[02:58:02.569 --> 02:58:05.069]  He said, you know, we had to put in our filings.
[02:58:05.190 --> 02:58:08.030]  This is criminal because it is and we've got to report it.
[02:58:08.290 --> 02:58:12.229]  I mean, you know about bid rigging, Viva, I'm ranting, but what do you say?
[02:58:12.430 --> 02:58:15.469]  No, Alex, well, first of all, it's outrageous what they did.
[02:58:15.530 --> 02:58:20.250]  And now that we've seen it, I loved in your motion to disqualify your emergency.
[02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:21.780]  Injunction motion to disqualify.
[02:58:34.139 --> 02:58:56.479]  Other financial consideration to jack it up to $7 million where they say treat it as though it's a $7 million offer, which is still an absolute act of prejudice to the judgment creditors because, well, they'll get assets worth $7 million or whatever and put out of business the golden goose that would have otherwise given them millions and millions of dollars over the next course of years that they rejected by way of settlement.
[02:58:56.780 --> 02:59:08.379]  But the ecosystem here is it's part and parcel of You know, Kamala Harris, which some people call Hillary Clinton 2.0, she's just as evil, just not as smart.
[02:59:09.540 --> 02:59:18.139]  What we witnessed in this 2024 election cycle are the fruits of, I'm gonna say, an unburdened internet, an unrestricted internet.
[02:59:18.379 --> 02:59:21.659]  And it's why they wanted to shut you down for the last eight years.
[02:59:21.860 --> 02:59:34.420]  I firmly believe, this is Robert Barnes' theory as well, that the lawfare against you coincided with Hillary Clinton's loss because the machine blamed you and your voice and your followers for electing Donald Trump.
[02:59:34.440 --> 02:59:46.909]  And they come back to 2024. Where they're still trying to shut you down, and this is their lawyers who said it in open court, because a free internet allows for the unveiling, the removal of the mask of the Kamala Harris's.
[02:59:47.149 --> 02:59:52.790]  It's literally reality, their reality versus an uncensored internet.
[02:59:53.090 --> 02:59:58.950]  And it's the difference between Kamala Harris's profile pic and the haggard slurring speech Kamala Harris from yesterday.
[02:59:59.170 --> 03:00:02.649]  So this is about shutting down the populist voices.
[03:00:02.889 --> 03:00:14.260]  It's not a Accident who they went after leading up to this election and after the election, going after the CEO from Polymarket, going after the CEO of Telegram.
[03:00:14.379 --> 03:00:15.579]  I'm gonna forget the company.
[03:00:15.799 --> 03:00:22.219]  So all of this is, it's a scheme not even being waged by the judgment creditors against you.
[03:00:22.319 --> 03:00:30.620]  It's being waged by the trustee, by We're good to go.
[03:00:47.200 --> 03:00:50.040]  Man, look, maybe the laws are wildly different here, but they're not.
[03:00:50.239 --> 03:01:00.239]  What they did was so wildly underhanded, to put it mildly, and I'm sitting there saying that there's no way that the judge in bankruptcy is going to approve of this because the judge has to.
[03:01:00.500 --> 03:01:07.360]  And you go read MSNBC, whatever the propaganda outlets, and they'll say, well, technically the judge has to authorize it, but typically they show deference to the trustee.
[03:01:07.719 --> 03:01:08.200]  Horse crap.
[03:01:08.420 --> 03:01:11.819]  I'm very curious to see where this goes on December 9th for the evidentiary.
[03:01:12.020 --> 03:01:13.840]  But the bottom line, tie this all together.
[03:01:14.260 --> 03:01:22.780]  This is an attempt to shut you down, shut you up because of your reach and because of who you impact on the political scale.
[03:01:22.780 --> 03:01:25.920]  And by the way, they admit all of that and say they don't want money.
[03:01:26.040 --> 03:01:30.760]  So they want non-dischargeable debt, and they don't want me to be able to raise money, and they say that.
[03:01:31.540 --> 03:01:34.059]  And they want your likeness and your image.
[03:01:34.180 --> 03:01:36.079]  And they want your personal social media accounts.
[03:01:36.219 --> 03:01:38.559]  And they want to turn you into an indentured servant.
[03:01:38.659 --> 03:01:39.979]  It's quite clear what they want.
[03:01:40.420 --> 03:01:46.760]  Moreover than that, they want to take Infowars and desecrate its legacy for whatever they think that legacy is.
[03:01:46.860 --> 03:01:50.579]  Some people are going to think Infowars is defined by this lawsuit.
[03:01:50.760 --> 03:01:56.180]  Others are going to say Infowars has been more right than MSNBC, CNN, and all of the other legacy media.
[03:01:56.399 --> 03:02:05.459]  They want to take the memory of Infowars and turn it into the legacy of The Onion, an unfunny propaganda parody, satire rag.
[03:02:05.719 --> 03:02:09.600]  So that in five years from now, people say, oh, Infowars, isn't that the parody network?
[03:02:09.700 --> 03:02:13.819]  Much like people look at LiveLeak now and have no idea what that website used to be back in the day.
[03:02:14.059 --> 03:02:15.719]  They want to destroy the memory of it.
[03:02:15.819 --> 03:02:18.579]  And it's a Marxist-type strategy.
[03:02:18.799 --> 03:02:20.920]  It's no different than blowing up monuments.
[03:02:21.059 --> 03:02:22.940]  It's no different than tearing down buildings and burning books.
[03:02:23.100 --> 03:02:28.590]  They're trying to digitally burn the book of what Infowars is, It's also what the Taliban does.
[03:02:29.010 --> 03:02:32.069]  Yeah, it's what they do.
[03:02:32.350 --> 03:02:44.149]  Destroy history because they're incapable of creating, and they want to destroy the legacy of Infowars so that in five years' time, had they gotten away with it but for these meddling kids, the memory of Infowars wouldn't have even been the defamation lawsuit.
[03:02:44.290 --> 03:02:47.889]  It wouldn't have even been Alex Jones being right more often than not to the point where it's become a meme.
[03:02:48.430 --> 03:02:53.430]  Infowars would be the Onion 2.0, an unfunny satire rag that nobody reads.
[03:02:53.430 --> 03:02:58.209]  Well, listen, my lawyers don't ever want to say 100%, but they said We do not see how.
[03:02:58.350 --> 03:02:59.850]  Because they can say, oh, it's his business discretion.
[03:03:00.250 --> 03:03:14.469]  It's his business discretion to change the rules 48 hours before and then give a separate set of rules to the real highest bidder that followed all the rules and then gives them a rule where they can use formulas and credit and it's made up crap.
[03:03:14.829 --> 03:03:25.889]  I mean, you can't have a fake auction that's not to the highest bidder and say it's his business discretion and then say, but I gave them one rule and the other people another rule.
[03:03:26.579 --> 03:03:42.260]  Beyond that, Alex, what's going to happen here in their motion, they were belaboring the point that the Connecticut plaintiffs or the judgment creditors have something like, whatever, 97% of a claim over the judgment itself.
[03:03:42.989 --> 03:03:47.790]  And the problem is they're acting in a way that is detrimental to the Texas plaintiffs.
[03:03:48.110 --> 03:03:52.030]  And so you are, at some point in time, you're gonna have infighting if you don't already have it.
[03:03:52.030 --> 03:03:53.049]  I'm not privy to any of this.
[03:03:53.209 --> 03:03:55.729]  You're gonna have infighting between the judgment creditors.
[03:03:55.809 --> 03:03:58.290]  The Texas plaintiffs are gonna say, Connecticut, I don't care.
[03:03:58.290 --> 03:03:59.750]  Yeah, the judge said that at the hearing.
[03:04:01.790 --> 03:04:08.750]  Monday, he said, listen, on the 9th, we're going to have a hearing on whether the sale is legal and whether it...
[03:04:08.750 --> 03:04:09.850]  But he said a bunch.
[03:04:09.989 --> 03:04:11.030]  He said the sale did not go through.
[03:04:11.450 --> 03:04:12.270]  It did not happen.
[03:04:12.309 --> 03:04:13.329]  Everybody needs to stop saying that.
[03:04:13.430 --> 03:04:14.809]  Anybody that thinks there was a sale, there wasn't.
[03:04:14.950 --> 03:04:16.190]  It did not happen.
[03:04:16.829 --> 03:04:19.370]  Okay, and he said like 10 times status quo, it's back to Alex Jones.
[03:04:19.569 --> 03:04:23.170]  So all the headlines and the onion on their site saying, Tetrahedron, we own Infowars.
[03:04:23.309 --> 03:04:24.229]  They're in trouble there.
[03:04:24.469 --> 03:04:25.790]  Obviously, total violation.
[03:04:25.809 --> 03:04:26.649]  It's hijacking.
[03:04:26.649 --> 03:04:27.049]  It's illegal.
[03:04:27.850 --> 03:04:31.129]  It's a violation of private property rights.
[03:04:31.250 --> 03:04:31.770]  It's trespassing.
[03:04:32.579 --> 03:04:46.620]  But the judge also said, then I'm going to have another hearing on the Texas plaintiffs and on PQPR and the other people that have claims and Alex Jones' intellectual property that the judge said don't put in the auction that they still put.
[03:04:46.620 --> 03:04:50.260]  So he's given them two hurdles to get over.
[03:04:50.360 --> 03:04:57.379]  And then he said, and when I learn more at this next hearing, if I learn Murray talk to anybody on the other side about this, Which is illegal.
[03:04:57.639 --> 03:04:59.540]  He said there may be more hearings.
[03:04:59.719 --> 03:05:01.379]  So what does that signify?
[03:05:01.600 --> 03:05:03.340]  It's not me under investigation now.
[03:05:03.459 --> 03:05:03.940]  It's them.
[03:05:05.079 --> 03:05:10.139]  First of all, I'm not going to feel smarter because I didn't know that that was discussed in court.
[03:05:10.299 --> 03:05:17.360]  But it's obvious because you have the Connecticut plaintiffs who say we own the bulk of this judgment credit, the $1.5 billion.
[03:05:17.659 --> 03:05:23.059]  And so we get now to act in a way that is to the financial detriment of the Texas plaintiffs.
[03:05:23.180 --> 03:05:26.200]  I don't know if they're on board with it, but why the heck would they be?
[03:05:26.329 --> 03:05:46.670]  Why would they say, well, forego however many tens of millions of dollars was on the table over the course of years, so that you can buy the assets for $1.75 million, and the portion that's gonna go to the Texas plaintiffs is going to be what the Connecticut plaintiffs forego by way of future proceeds that the Onion would have to pay to them from the revenues of the assets of Info,
[03:05:46.729 --> 03:05:48.090]  which are gonna dwindle to zero.
[03:05:48.649 --> 03:05:51.049]  It's derivatives of derivatives of derivatives.
[03:05:52.250 --> 03:06:02.969]  What it is, is it's a fraudulent scheme to prejudice bona fide judgment creditors to piss away an offer that was a very generous offer, if anybody can believe that term.
[03:06:03.309 --> 03:06:16.770]  I don't know the terms, but if that's what it was, what might very well happen in all of this, by the way, is it gets overturned on appeal in any event, and they get a big fat goose egg for whatever they don't have to pay back if they- Under Texas law, they didn't pay it all back.
[03:06:17.680 --> 03:06:18.860]  With interest, from what I understand.
[03:06:19.020 --> 03:06:21.239]  So it's not just a wild gambit.
[03:06:21.500 --> 03:06:30.819]  Oh, it gets worse, did you know the lawyers representing all of them have not gone in and represented it as if for companies or them, they've been doing it personally.
[03:06:32.600 --> 03:06:36.020]  Alex, it was quite clear that this was something of an operation from day one.
[03:06:36.200 --> 03:06:46.000]  And it's quite clear that the Sandy Hook families who partook in this lawsuit, because not all of them did, and most people don't know that, are being used and exploited by these interests.
[03:06:46.159 --> 03:07:03.819]  And it's terrible because from a public PR perspective, anybody who rightly is sympathetic to everyone and anyone affected by Sandy Hook is now looking at these judgment creditors and saying, how is it going to I don't really quell any of your suffering to put out of business Alex Jones,
[03:07:03.959 --> 03:07:13.920]  a man who, whatever you said, over 14 minutes worth of stuff over 10 years, and much of it was not denial, but much of it was other, I'd say theorizing, which is understandable.
[03:07:15.180 --> 03:07:15.680]  What do you think?
[03:07:15.840 --> 03:07:20.219]  People out there are not gonna say, like, it's a tragedy of unspeakable proportions.
[03:07:20.559 --> 03:07:26.399]  Shutting down Infowars and Alex Jones and trying to defraud him out of his assets is not gonna make anyone more sympathetic to your cause.
[03:07:28.350 --> 03:07:29.090]  We'll see what happens.
[03:07:29.170 --> 03:07:31.030]  But that guy there, Ben Collins.
[03:07:31.250 --> 03:07:32.030]  I forgot that.
[03:07:32.110 --> 03:07:35.010]  I think I've had an internet back and forth, or at least I've tagged him a few times.
[03:07:35.629 --> 03:07:36.930]  One underscore is his handle.
[03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:38.989]  I didn't realize that this is the guy behind us.
[03:07:39.129 --> 03:07:45.530]  I mean, by all accounts, a scoundrel of epic proportions coming out and assuring the public that they've actually bought the assets of Infowars.
[03:07:45.709 --> 03:07:46.889]  I mean, this is insane.
[03:07:47.069 --> 03:07:48.350]  It's fraudulent misrepresentation.
[03:07:48.350 --> 03:07:49.610]  And I wonder how they feel now.
[03:07:50.200 --> 03:07:52.780]  Two weeks back in the building, judge said the sale didn't go through.
[03:07:53.280 --> 03:07:54.040]  Very embarrassing.
[03:07:54.219 --> 03:07:55.020]  We're almost out of time.
[03:07:55.159 --> 03:07:56.319]  I want to get you back on about this.
[03:07:56.399 --> 03:08:00.639]  You've really been exposing some of the most outrageous transgender worship going on.
[03:08:00.959 --> 03:08:02.559]  And again, it's a global attack.
[03:08:02.700 --> 03:08:04.319]  What's happening in Canada is happening here.
[03:08:04.979 --> 03:08:06.100]  Look at some of these headlines.
[03:08:06.299 --> 03:08:12.540]  At 16, I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in under an hour and given sex change surgery after just two appointments.
[03:08:12.760 --> 03:08:15.420]  I'm suing the doctors who permanently mutilated me.
[03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:16.440]  Good.
[03:08:16.659 --> 03:08:17.659]  Here's another one.
[03:08:19.250 --> 03:08:20.389]  The article all about it.
[03:08:20.530 --> 03:08:20.950]  What happened?
[03:08:21.649 --> 03:08:27.750]  Transgender police officers in British Transport Division are now allowed to strip search women in UK under new rules.
[03:08:28.370 --> 03:08:28.709]  Shock!
[03:08:29.270 --> 03:08:33.989]  Tranny police officer drugs two colleagues, sexually abuses them with a penis pump in Berlin.
[03:08:35.239 --> 03:08:36.159]  It goes on.
[03:08:52.069 --> 03:08:59.870]  Why is asking the sexuality at work considered sexual harassment, but talking about sexuality to kids in elementary school is considered essential?
[03:09:01.450 --> 03:09:02.370]  And it goes on.
[03:09:02.450 --> 03:09:04.950]  And now this, this big story, we've got about five minutes to hit it.
[03:09:05.149 --> 03:09:11.069]  Tell us about this case of this man who now says he's a woman, what he did and what they're doing in the prisons.
[03:09:11.090 --> 03:09:14.190]  This is one of the biggest scandals ever of the outrageous behavior.
[03:09:14.329 --> 03:09:15.329]  Tell us about this, Viva Frye.
[03:09:15.559 --> 03:09:21.639]  Alex, I said I was gonna put this on as much blast as possible because the story goes back to 2022, 2023-ish.
[03:09:21.700 --> 03:09:34.559]  Say 2022, a man named Muhammad al-Balouz is accused of murdering, stabbing his wife to death 23 times, drowning the two children, drinking some sort of chemical to try to kill himself, and setting the apartment on fire.
[03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:43.719]  And firefighters come, put out the fire, discover his wife who's been stabbed to death, two dead children who they believe died before the fire because there was no smoke inhaled into their lungs.
[03:09:44.389 --> 03:09:51.750]  That's what happened in 2022. All of the reporting at the time, man accused of killing, they didn't say his wife killing woman, they tried to hide that fact.
[03:09:52.350 --> 03:09:54.569]  You know, father of the kids, yada, yada, yada.
[03:09:54.889 --> 03:10:02.629]  Fast forward two years, I'm reading an article in the Gazette, which is the Montreal, it's a Canadian propagandist rag, you know, government funded.
[03:10:03.090 --> 03:10:09.290]  And I'm reading the article, and it says a woman is accused of murdering her wife.
[03:10:09.709 --> 03:10:11.450]  I said like a long gay woman.
[03:10:11.670 --> 03:10:14.309]  And I'm like, what the hell is going on?
[03:10:14.409 --> 03:10:15.370]  I'm reading through this article.
[03:10:16.370 --> 03:10:27.409]  It seems Mohamed Al-Balouz, in the last two years since being accused of triple homicide, double infanticide, decided he's a woman.
[03:10:27.920 --> 03:10:31.620]  And so, this is where my thinking goes in all of this.
[03:10:31.780 --> 03:10:38.360]  The guy's obviously, to the extent he's innocent, is proven guilty, but I'll believe that he's a murderous psychopath, is obviously a psychopath.
[03:10:38.700 --> 03:10:44.879]  And has obviously decided the way to game the system, the way to victimize the victims yet again, is to now say, I'm a woman.
[03:10:45.149 --> 03:10:47.489]  And you need to refer to me as a she, her.
[03:10:47.709 --> 03:10:48.329]  That's fine.
[03:10:48.430 --> 03:10:49.170]  He's a psychopath.
[03:10:49.350 --> 03:10:50.209]  That's what psychos do.
[03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:56.909]  But the media plays along with this and refers to him as a her, murdering her wife, her children.
[03:10:57.069 --> 03:11:03.139]  I'm reading the article and I don't understand reality anymore because on the one hand, They refer to him as Muhammad.
[03:11:03.340 --> 03:11:05.120]  Some of the articles actually mix up the genders.
[03:11:05.360 --> 03:11:18.959]  Then you have the prosecutor, and I've now been able to at least verify this by so-called legacy media, getting up during this trial and saying to the jury, you're going to hear us identifying the accused as a him.
[03:11:19.120 --> 03:11:24.180]  Because at the time of the alleged murder, he identified as a man, and now he no longer does.
[03:11:24.280 --> 03:11:27.040]  We're not doing this to be disrespectful or to shock you.
[03:11:27.159 --> 03:11:27.700]  And I'm like...
[03:11:27.790 --> 03:11:30.549]  Holy hell, I'm taking crazy pills, Alex.
[03:11:30.670 --> 03:11:41.309]  I feel like I'm going crazy that nobody, at least in Canada, is up in arms about what is an assault on women's rights, an assault on logic, an assault on good reason, and an assault on language.
[03:11:41.489 --> 03:11:43.989]  And the prosecutor is playing along with it.
[03:11:44.170 --> 03:11:46.610]  Apparently, I'm still trying to get independent confirmation.
[03:11:46.930 --> 03:11:50.069]  The man is being held at a woman's detention facility.
[03:11:50.270 --> 03:11:54.649]  And this is a man accused of murdering his wife.
[03:11:54.989 --> 03:12:02.889]  Domestic abuse and their children is being holed up, if it's true, at a woman's detention facility with other women.
[03:12:03.229 --> 03:12:13.889]  And that he shows up to trial, by the way, Alex, wearing what they called, I think it was a cheap blonde wig with red fingernails, identifying as Levana.
[03:12:14.229 --> 03:12:20.129]  And you got the prosecutor, the court system, and the media in Canada playing along with this delusion.
[03:12:20.569 --> 03:12:23.610]  And I don't know who is sicker and who is more psychopathic.
[03:12:23.709 --> 03:12:29.149]  The guy who is sick and psychopathic and accused of killing his wife and kids, or a media that plays along with the nonsense.
[03:12:30.170 --> 03:12:31.389]  Well, I totally agree.
[03:12:31.409 --> 03:12:38.090]  And it's all just insane clowns, all funded by big think tanks to break up society.
[03:12:38.229 --> 03:12:41.629]  And then we hear the headlines, two women in prison having a baby.
[03:12:41.709 --> 03:12:43.350]  No, it's a man saying he's a woman having a baby.
[03:12:43.469 --> 03:12:45.049]  And then now they're raping people.
[03:12:45.229 --> 03:12:49.170]  And all this is going on, and they've got to defend him and say it's okay.
[03:12:49.950 --> 03:12:51.309]  And then you've got statistics.
[03:12:51.489 --> 03:13:02.270]  Suddenly, women committing more violent crime, and you look at the statistics, no, it's men that claim they're women committing crimes saying they're women, so now the criminology's changed, scapegoating women now saying they're becoming more violent.
[03:13:02.389 --> 03:13:06.329]  I mean, this is psychological warfare, but the world's waking up, it's rejecting it.
[03:13:06.590 --> 03:13:07.729]  No, there's no question.
[03:13:07.850 --> 03:13:12.270]  And I said that as a joke, like, okay, so now does this crime count as a murder alleged committed by a woman?
[03:13:12.569 --> 03:13:17.530]  They changed the identity so that now it's not, you know, people might have been asking the question, was he an illegal immigrant?
[03:13:17.549 --> 03:13:18.430]  Was he an illegal alien?
[03:13:18.590 --> 03:13:20.829]  Or if he wasn't, was he a legal immigrant?
[03:13:21.049 --> 03:13:22.270]  And is this what's being done?
[03:13:22.389 --> 03:13:27.750]  Is this the type of stuff that's being committed, crimes that are being committed by People that are being allowed into the country from the regime.
[03:13:27.989 --> 03:13:29.610]  So they changed the name, changed the gender.
[03:13:29.729 --> 03:13:31.489]  You have no idea what the hell's going on two years later.
[03:13:31.950 --> 03:13:35.829]  And now California's about to pass a law to let sex offenders change their names.
[03:13:36.190 --> 03:13:37.510]  It just goes on and on.
[03:13:37.670 --> 03:13:38.790]  So they can't be discovered.
[03:13:38.950 --> 03:13:41.829]  Viva Fry, thank you so much for following you on X at The Viva Fry.
[03:13:42.229 --> 03:13:42.909]  God bless you.
[03:13:42.950 --> 03:13:43.670]  Have a great Thanksgiving.
[03:13:43.829 --> 03:13:44.870]  I look forward to talking to you again soon, my friend.
[03:13:45.129 --> 03:13:45.790]  Thank you very much.
[03:13:45.950 --> 03:13:46.290]  God bless.
[03:13:46.350 --> 03:13:46.770]  Have a good one.
[03:13:47.229 --> 03:13:47.610]  Thank you.
[03:13:47.750 --> 03:13:47.950]  All right.
[03:13:48.069 --> 03:13:51.090]  Look, I had a bunch of news I didn't get to, but I'm going to shoot some special reports.
[03:13:51.350 --> 03:13:53.930]  Coming up, though, we're going to look at, is the earth flat?
[03:13:54.409 --> 03:13:55.870]  Is the Easter Bunny real?
[03:13:56.069 --> 03:13:59.250]  And can the left criticize flat earthers when they believe two men can have a baby?
[03:13:59.489 --> 03:14:00.389]  It's all coming up.
[03:14:00.489 --> 03:14:01.030]  Stay with us.
[03:14:01.389 --> 03:14:06.489]  I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's going to save this country and nothing's going to stop it.
[03:14:07.549 --> 03:14:11.049]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[03:14:11.250 --> 03:14:13.870]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[03:14:14.030 --> 03:14:14.770]  I'm still not in shape.
[03:14:15.709 --> 03:14:17.069]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[03:14:17.209 --> 03:14:18.149]  Don't tell me eating right.
[03:14:18.250 --> 03:14:19.010]  I'm not going to buy that shit.
[03:14:19.790 --> 03:14:22.510]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[03:14:23.450 --> 03:14:24.329]  Oh, no.
[03:14:25.590 --> 03:14:27.209]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[03:14:28.010 --> 03:14:33.329]  I did it all from the AlexJonesStore.com with Ultimate Seamoss, the ultimate seafood.
[03:14:33.510 --> 03:14:34.250]  That's why, right here.
[03:14:34.829 --> 03:14:40.110]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[03:14:40.149 --> 03:14:41.889]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[03:14:42.129 --> 03:14:43.809]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[03:14:46.530 --> 03:14:50.469]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss.
[03:14:50.610 --> 03:14:54.049]  And I am doing a plug here, because, you know, we could be shut down next to...
[03:14:54.049 --> 03:14:57.250]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court.
[03:14:57.389 --> 03:15:00.590]  But we'll continue on in the air one way or another, working with great folks.
[03:15:01.389 --> 03:15:06.870]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, here we are in the Planet Earth Global Society.
[03:15:07.750 --> 03:15:12.030]  Yes, the Earth is a sphere, a globe.
[03:15:13.669 --> 03:15:23.610]  And I noticed in the last few days that I reposted a couple of clips from Modern Warfare with Alex Jones, a fan site, saying things like, Flat Earthers are retarded.
[03:15:23.909 --> 03:15:28.030]  This latest one got 9.9 million views just in the last day.
[03:15:28.110 --> 03:15:29.930]  I'm sure it'll only go up from there.
[03:15:30.489 --> 03:15:32.389]  This has been quite the firestorm.
[03:15:33.030 --> 03:15:37.809]  And I've gotten some real criticism from both the left and what you'd call the right.
[03:15:38.760 --> 03:15:44.719]  The left is really freaked out and saying, wait, Alex, we thought that you were a flat earther.
[03:15:45.100 --> 03:15:49.620]  This is logical to say that the world is actually a sphere.
[03:15:50.059 --> 03:15:57.940]  So, now that the left and Democrats are saying that the world is a sphere, I've got to come out and say...
[03:15:58.629 --> 03:15:59.389]  That can't be.
[03:15:59.549 --> 03:16:04.270]  It must actually be a cube or something because you guys are always wrong.
[03:16:04.489 --> 03:16:05.489]  No, no, seriously.
[03:16:06.030 --> 03:16:10.809]  The left criticizing flat earthers when you believe two men can have a baby.
[03:16:11.430 --> 03:16:16.989]  Bill Guy, the science guy, now has edited old shows from the 90s where he talked about X and Y chromosomes.
[03:16:17.229 --> 03:16:17.809]  Those don't exist.
[03:16:18.459 --> 03:16:22.040]  You believe that Kamala was authentic and really popular and cool.
[03:16:22.379 --> 03:16:24.219]  You think Tim Walls wasn't creepy.
[03:16:24.440 --> 03:16:26.559]  You think Joe Biden was sharp as a tack.
[03:16:26.899 --> 03:16:38.500]  You still love Rachel Maddow getting $87,000 a day from Pfizer to say that the shots were safe and effective and you couldn't get COVID if you took it.
[03:16:38.639 --> 03:16:40.100]  You couldn't spread it.
[03:16:41.079 --> 03:16:49.530]  Instead of the virus being able to hop from person to person to person, Potentially mutating and becoming more virulent and drug resistant along the way.
[03:16:49.729 --> 03:16:56.770]  Now we know that the vaccines work well enough that the virus stops with every vaccinated person.
[03:16:57.469 --> 03:17:00.149]  A vaccinated person gets exposed to the virus.
[03:17:01.469 --> 03:17:03.709]  The virus does not infect them.
[03:17:03.889 --> 03:17:06.989]  The virus cannot then use that person to go anywhere else.
[03:17:08.549 --> 03:17:12.389]  It cannot use a vaccinated person as a host to go get more people.
[03:17:13.739 --> 03:17:19.059]  That means the vaccines will get us to the end of this.
[03:17:19.479 --> 03:17:30.120]  I mean, you guys believe Microsoft and Bill Gates and King Charles and Klaus Schwab wanting to cut off your energy is a loving thing to save the earth.
[03:17:30.260 --> 03:17:34.379]  You think carbon dioxide is a deadly poison like carbon monoxide.
[03:17:34.379 --> 03:17:37.059]  You don't know it's part of the four pillars of life.
[03:17:37.139 --> 03:17:37.719]  Sunshine.
[03:17:38.899 --> 03:17:44.440]  Water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen, you need that for the carbon cycle in life on this planet.
[03:17:44.719 --> 03:17:49.399]  Plants respirate from carbon dioxide and then put off oxygen.
[03:17:49.920 --> 03:17:54.780]  I mean, look, I could use the term for water, scientific term.
[03:17:54.920 --> 03:17:58.159]  In fact, I've gone out and done it with leftists at UT many times.
[03:17:58.319 --> 03:18:07.209]  We've shown you the reports, and the majority of them say ban water because banning water is just as crazy as As banning carbon dioxide.
[03:18:07.389 --> 03:18:08.989]  People go, well it has a scarier sounding name.
[03:18:09.530 --> 03:18:09.690]  Really?
[03:18:09.770 --> 03:18:12.889]  Dihydrogen monoxide sounds even scarier than carbon dioxide.
[03:18:13.250 --> 03:18:21.430]  And so they went out and she said the vast majority I mean, she talked to a lot of people, so many, we can't even show them all.
[03:18:21.709 --> 03:18:22.670]  Almost all of them.
[03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:28.510]  I think she said one guy came back and said, wait a minute, isn't that water?
[03:18:28.829 --> 03:18:30.069]  Can you sign my petition?
[03:18:31.450 --> 03:18:34.610]  I'm trying to get them to ban dehydrogen monoxide.
[03:18:34.729 --> 03:18:36.670]  It's an additive in certain junk foods.
[03:18:36.909 --> 03:18:39.889]  And basically, we're trying to get enough signatures to get them to ban it.
[03:18:40.229 --> 03:18:40.549]  Sure.
[03:18:41.090 --> 03:18:41.850]  Oh, okay.
[03:18:42.409 --> 03:18:42.770]  Awesome.
[03:18:42.950 --> 03:18:43.430]  Well, good luck.
[03:18:43.870 --> 03:18:47.370]  I mean, if you want to read, otherwise, you can just take my word for it.
[03:18:47.530 --> 03:18:48.750]  What's the source of the hydrogen oxide?
[03:18:48.969 --> 03:18:49.610]  Where's it coming from?
[03:18:49.850 --> 03:18:53.129]  Well, it's one of the major components of acid rain.
[03:18:53.370 --> 03:18:55.790]  It doesn't come off, like, obviously, when you go to wash your fruit.
[03:18:56.250 --> 03:18:57.450]  It's just everywhere now.
[03:18:58.190 --> 03:18:59.309]  We need it out of here!
[03:19:00.049 --> 03:19:00.950]  I will help you out.
[03:19:03.299 --> 03:19:05.840]  It's now being dumped into lakes, rivers, and streams.
[03:19:06.239 --> 03:19:11.860]  So of course with our whole system, it then gets in the air.
[03:19:16.680 --> 03:19:21.920]  When you give them the scary-sounding scientific name for it, dihydrogen monoxide.
[03:19:22.479 --> 03:19:31.479]  So, you are not in any position to criticize the flat earthers for being, quite frankly, out of their minds.
[03:19:31.559 --> 03:19:32.260]  I mean, who could blame them?
[03:19:32.379 --> 03:19:41.819]  We've been lied to about so much stuff in this world, like the private Federal Reserve being a government institution, or there being WMDs in Iraq that...
[03:19:42.549 --> 03:19:45.729]  Why do you expect them to believe anything we're told?
[03:19:45.889 --> 03:20:03.790]  But that said, let me address the Earth and the fact that it is a sphere very, very quickly for everybody out there who seems to have trouble with the basic observable real science on our planet today.
[03:20:03.790 --> 03:20:05.190]  And it's simply this.
[03:20:05.950 --> 03:20:25.629]  If you go back to the formation of our galaxy out of the larger expansion of the universe, and if you look at the observable facts, the planets are wreckage from larger kinetic explosions and giant thermonuclear reactions that we see all around us.
[03:20:25.729 --> 03:20:31.049]  They're called suns up in the heavens that we orbit our sun.
[03:20:31.430 --> 03:20:44.600]  That large We're good to go.
[03:20:56.610 --> 03:21:05.250]  And then, of course, you've got the gas giants, and you've got planets that aren't gas giants, like Mercury closest to the sun, and then Venus, and then the Earth, and then Mars.
[03:21:05.450 --> 03:21:07.309]  And then again, you go out to the gas giants.
[03:21:08.549 --> 03:21:19.049]  Those are thrown off into zero gravity, so they form into spheres as water droplets and everything else does in zero gravity.
[03:21:19.190 --> 03:21:35.709]  And for anybody that's ever been a welder, I'm not a good welder, but I've done some basic welding, Notice is that when you're welding and pieces of the melting welding arc fall off, just in the time they fall from the arc where they're liquid, because they're superheated,
[03:21:35.809 --> 03:21:41.809]  down to the ground, they turn into little tiny round marbles, or spheres.
[03:21:42.090 --> 03:21:43.229]  So it's the same thing.
[03:21:48.570 --> 03:21:53.090]  We're good to go.
[03:22:07.760 --> 03:22:09.239]  And things like this.
[03:22:09.520 --> 03:22:16.719]  But here's a basic fact that anybody can go observe themselves and discover whether you're right or wrong.
[03:22:16.979 --> 03:22:20.479]  I've done quite a bit of amateur astronomy.
[03:22:20.479 --> 03:22:25.040]  When I was a kid, my dad progressively bought bigger and bigger telescopes.
[03:22:25.379 --> 03:22:37.329]  When I was 15, back before Meade was openly selling these to the public, he went down to San Antonio, Texas, and bought a $25,000, at the time, Huge telescope.
[03:22:38.290 --> 03:22:46.329]  And we would haul it out to the countryside outside Austin, Atlanta, that's more deserty, so there's less light pollution and the atmosphere's thinner.
[03:22:46.610 --> 03:22:52.049]  And we would, you know, drink a six-pack of beer or whatever and camp out and look at the stars all night long.
[03:22:52.250 --> 03:22:59.569]  The reason he wanted that system back, like, 1991 was Meade was just...
[03:23:03.570 --> 03:23:06.930]  We're good to go.
[03:23:17.920 --> 03:23:25.020]  That you want to look at and you type it in after you point it at a few way stars and then it mathematically aims at them and then tracks them.
[03:23:25.159 --> 03:23:32.899]  So you're not constantly aiming at a star or a nebula, but as the earth and things move, it goes out of field very quickly.
[03:23:33.020 --> 03:23:37.680]  It stays on it with tiny motors and it just makes astronomy incredible.
[03:23:38.399 --> 03:23:47.479]  So starting at about the age of 15, 16, I mean, I haven't done it with my dad since I was probably about 30. Because it takes two people to move this big giant thing around.
[03:23:47.639 --> 03:23:50.540]  We really should go dig it out or buy a new one and go back and do it.
[03:23:50.680 --> 03:23:59.120]  And we would even hook 35mm cameras to the aperture and then take time-lapse photos of comets and Mars and Saturn and Jupiter.
[03:23:59.299 --> 03:24:00.739]  I've got to dig those out there somewhere.
[03:24:00.920 --> 03:24:03.040]  These incredible color photos I took.
[03:24:03.540 --> 03:24:12.950]  So it wasn't Me watching NASA videos, and we know NASA has faked a lot of stuff for propaganda purposes and dolled things up.
[03:24:13.129 --> 03:24:22.010]  It wasn't, you know, Alex Jones going and looking through the McDonnell Douglas giant telescope, or who knows, they might be feeding us fake video or something.
[03:24:22.409 --> 03:24:25.049]  This is Alex Jones with my dad, Dr. David Jones.
[03:24:25.899 --> 03:24:41.059]  With a big telescope, looking at the stars, looking at the planets, looking at the horsehead nebula, you name it, and taking amazing photos and looking through the aperture with the magnifiers with my own eye,
[03:24:41.239 --> 03:24:42.739]  with my own brain directly.
[03:24:43.100 --> 03:24:57.850]  And you can look At different planets, and if you're out there long enough, hours, you can see them rotating, and you can see them actually doing what the Earth does, spinning.
[03:24:58.829 --> 03:25:02.170]  But there's another time you can do it, not just at night.
[03:25:02.290 --> 03:25:16.229]  You can get a green filter to protect your eyes and the instrument, and a special sun filter for your telescope, and you can aim it at the sun and And you can see sunspots on it, mass coronal ejections, you name it.
[03:25:16.409 --> 03:25:34.170]  You can even now, with computers, put a sensor in it and record on the computer all day if you want, while the telescope tracks the sun, and then you'll have a good time lapse of the sun actually turning, and you can see it for yourself and see the corona and everything.
[03:25:34.549 --> 03:25:43.420]  So I, with my own eyeballs, Have observed the heavenly bodies moving and turning.
[03:25:43.719 --> 03:25:52.079]  And if you get a really good telescope, and only the clearest nights can we do this, you could even see some of the larger moons of Jupiter and see them moving.
[03:25:52.299 --> 03:25:58.239]  Now, some of them are in an orbit around Jupiter or Saturn where they stay in one spot and don't turn.
[03:25:59.379 --> 03:26:00.579]  But others are.
[03:26:00.840 --> 03:26:02.159]  Now, take the moon.
[03:26:02.360 --> 03:26:05.239]  For all of recorded history, it's been faced the same way, Edison.
[03:26:05.420 --> 03:26:06.340]  It's right there.
[03:26:06.440 --> 03:26:09.860]  But you can certainly see that it's a sphere as well.
[03:26:10.020 --> 03:26:12.899]  So let me put this to bed for everyone.
[03:26:13.579 --> 03:26:19.680]  Yes, the ancients would debate whether it was round or whether it was flat because they didn't know.
[03:26:20.139 --> 03:26:23.940]  But satellites and all of this technology is real.
[03:26:24.879 --> 03:26:31.620]  Yes, I know that NASA and others do send up high-altitude balloons that have communication systems on them as well.
[03:26:31.680 --> 03:26:32.520]  There's big blimps.
[03:26:32.719 --> 03:26:33.819]  The Pentagon has them.
[03:26:34.079 --> 03:26:35.559]  That's certainly there as well.
[03:26:35.639 --> 03:26:47.760]  But just because there's big blimps and balloons up at 60,000 feet that are solar-powered doing telecommunications doesn't mean that there's not satellites above that in different types of orbit.
[03:26:48.079 --> 03:26:51.840]  Now, whenever I talk to flat-earthers about this, it's kind of like the left.
[03:26:51.840 --> 03:26:53.040]  It's just a religious thing.
[03:26:53.700 --> 03:26:55.299]  No, there are no X and Y chromosomes.
[03:26:55.659 --> 03:26:57.299]  There are 50-something genders.
[03:26:58.500 --> 03:26:59.739]  Pedophilia isn't pedophilia.
[03:26:59.959 --> 03:27:01.079]  It's minor attracted persons.
[03:27:01.639 --> 03:27:06.520]  When I see all of this, these are really religious beliefs.
[03:27:06.879 --> 03:27:08.860]  And so it's hard to get people off of them.
[03:27:08.940 --> 03:27:23.670]  But Every time I talk to, I have friends that are really funny and smart in ways, I mean, kind of goofy in others, who will argue with me and really get mad that I don't believe that the world is a realm or flat.
[03:27:23.950 --> 03:27:25.790]  They'll joke and say, you're a globalist.
[03:27:25.909 --> 03:27:37.209]  So I guess I can't, I mean, I guess in a way I am a globalist in that way because I've observed these spheres in the heavenly bodies up in the space doing this.
[03:27:38.200 --> 03:27:49.579]  But when I bring up the fact that you can observe the sun turning with your own eyeballs through a telescope, and they just don't want to talk about it.
[03:27:49.920 --> 03:27:51.159]  They don't want to discuss it.
[03:27:51.579 --> 03:27:52.739]  They don't want to look at it.
[03:27:53.340 --> 03:27:55.500]  So I think it's healthy to question everything.
[03:27:55.500 --> 03:27:57.760]  I'm not saying people are bad that think the earth is flat.
[03:27:59.440 --> 03:28:00.280]  People are bad.
[03:28:00.459 --> 03:28:01.239]  You're not bad.
[03:28:01.379 --> 03:28:06.040]  If you don't believe there's X and Y chromosomes, you may want to say you're a dolphin, not a man or woman.
[03:28:06.299 --> 03:28:17.159]  But when you try to brainwash young children and confuse them and get them into your cult and then take them away from their families so you can sterilize them as part of a larger globalist depopulation operation, that is wrong.
[03:28:17.600 --> 03:28:26.719]  So to the transgender cult, to the flat earthers, to people that believe communism is going to work, if you just try it one more time, all of you are welcome to your views.
[03:28:27.340 --> 03:28:38.280]  And I'm welcome to mine, and I'm not mad at any of you, but I just hope that this can be helpful for some of the people out there on what you call the left and the right.
[03:28:39.299 --> 03:28:50.420]  I'm just trying to give you my own personal observations, like Donald Trump's going to win in a landslide and override the fraud, or when I call the election at 10.30 at night before anybody else.
[03:28:50.760 --> 03:28:57.870]  See, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, and I'm not a guy talking about chupacabras and You know, stuff like that.
[03:28:58.110 --> 03:28:59.149]  That's other people.
[03:28:59.430 --> 03:29:05.610]  I'm covering real issues on air, and that's why we're tomorrow's news today.
[03:29:06.229 --> 03:29:16.030]  I'm covering things that are admitted, that are observable, and that are happening, and I'm promoting things that I see as good for society, and I'm opposing things I see as bad.
[03:29:16.129 --> 03:29:18.889]  And that's what we stand for.
[03:29:19.370 --> 03:29:24.010]  But as for everybody out there, again, trying to misrepresent that I'm a flat earther.
[03:29:24.010 --> 03:29:25.370]  I never have been.
[03:29:27.250 --> 03:29:32.629]  Never will be unless space travel becomes accessible enough to regular folks.
[03:29:32.969 --> 03:29:51.590]  And then if I, you know, go pay my money to go up into orbit, and man, I fly up there, and it is flat or a cube, or maybe it's a hockey stick, maybe it's a pretzel, maybe it's a hexagon.
[03:29:52.069 --> 03:29:54.530]  I mean, hell, maybe it's in the shape of a giant Easter bunny.
[03:29:55.479 --> 03:29:56.819]  Maybe it's Santa Claus.
[03:29:57.559 --> 03:30:00.280]  If I see that, I will let you know.
[03:30:01.340 --> 03:30:03.799]  But I've got one more point I want to say about this.
[03:30:04.340 --> 03:30:08.940]  I understand people have been lied to so much, you don't know what to believe anymore, and so it's healthy to question things.
[03:30:09.639 --> 03:30:16.639]  But when you go against logic, and it becomes something that's politically correct, it's totally insane.
[03:30:16.799 --> 03:30:26.739]  And the so-called anti-globalists get nuts sometimes, the so-called, you know, Leftists who are really just establishment cult members, they're completely out of their minds.
[03:30:29.280 --> 03:30:40.239]  But there's also, in skepticism, a thing where people always want to prove that they're the only person that's legitimate and really questioning things, and then everybody else is controlled by the New World Order.
[03:30:40.360 --> 03:30:42.340]  And that's not how the real world works.
[03:30:42.479 --> 03:30:44.399]  In my experience, most people are good.
[03:30:44.559 --> 03:30:45.520]  They're just ignorant.
[03:30:45.739 --> 03:30:48.379]  They are illiterate about geopolitics and history.
[03:30:48.639 --> 03:30:49.940]  And so they can be manipulated.
[03:30:50.059 --> 03:30:54.159]  And that's why general research of knowledge and history and personal experience is so important.
[03:30:54.639 --> 03:30:55.979]  And again, doing your own research.
[03:30:56.180 --> 03:31:01.540]  Back at the end of World War II, they had all this toxic waste from aluminum manufacturing, from the aircraft industry and other things.
[03:31:01.920 --> 03:31:11.360]  And so the establishment decided, hey, let's just put sodium fluoride that had been bug poisoned previously and still is bug poisoned, and it's a neurotoxin, into the water supply.
[03:31:11.459 --> 03:31:16.120]  It gives you dental fluorosis, gives you cancer, lowers IQ. That was known in studies back then.
[03:31:16.399 --> 03:31:19.620]  And so I've been on there 30 years with top scientists exposing that.
[03:31:19.700 --> 03:31:20.379]  I was the kook.
[03:31:20.459 --> 03:31:21.319]  I was the flat earther.
[03:31:21.739 --> 03:31:22.360]  I was nuts.
[03:31:22.500 --> 03:31:32.149]  Well, now, a couple months ago, The FDA came out, the CDC came out and said, you know what, it does massively lower IQ, and it does cause cancer, and it does cause infertility.
[03:31:32.350 --> 03:31:34.790]  And Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Alex Jones are right.
[03:31:35.030 --> 03:31:41.770]  Just like atrazine bends the genders in males and females, doesn't turn into the other sex, it just screws you up and makes you more hermaphroditic.
[03:31:42.859 --> 03:31:59.260]  So, my dad and his great company, drjonesnaturals.com, for many years has had fluoride-free toothpaste that also has iodine, nanosilver that's antibacterial and viral, and tea tree oil that's so good, and organic peppermint and more.
[03:31:59.479 --> 03:32:00.540]  And you know what?
[03:32:00.600 --> 03:32:01.719]  It's fluoride-free.
[03:32:01.719 --> 03:32:03.159]  I thought I was the kook.
[03:32:03.319 --> 03:32:04.479]  I thought I was the nut.
[03:32:04.579 --> 03:32:14.819]  No, I was backed up by science, like the Earth being a sphere or globe, Since it's formation, and I was right about that as well.
[03:32:15.059 --> 03:32:20.680]  So, if you want to get amazing products, go to my dad, a retired dentist, supplement site.
[03:32:20.799 --> 03:32:21.680]  He's also a great sponsor.
[03:32:21.920 --> 03:32:22.840]  Not part of InfoWars.
[03:32:22.899 --> 03:32:24.659]  Even if we shut down, this will continue on.
[03:32:24.819 --> 03:32:31.760]  To get your Super Blue, finally back in stock, 30% off at drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:32:32.120 --> 03:32:37.120]  Also, next level foundational energy is not a stimulant, but boy does it feel like one with no letdown.
[03:32:37.120 --> 03:32:39.860]  It is the breakdown in your cells of...
[03:32:40.519 --> 03:32:44.520]  Something that Popeye knows is good, strong to the finish, he eats his spinach.
[03:32:44.659 --> 03:32:45.399]  Well, what's his spinach?
[03:32:45.540 --> 03:32:46.239]  Folic acid.
[03:32:46.379 --> 03:32:50.399]  But most people cannot properly break down folic acid, especially Northern Europeans, genetically.
[03:32:50.739 --> 03:32:55.899]  So this is the total breakdown of it that your cells 100% use, cleans them out, gives you incredible energy.
[03:32:56.180 --> 03:32:57.620]  It's good for your entire body.
[03:32:57.799 --> 03:32:58.520]  It's amazing.
[03:32:58.700 --> 03:33:02.459]  It has other compounds in it, B-complex and more, that supercharge it.
[03:33:03.010 --> 03:33:07.829]  Believe me, if you want good cleaners with no letdown, you've never experienced anything like it, you need to get next level of foundational energy.
[03:33:07.969 --> 03:33:23.790]  And then two things I don't have to sell anybody on unless you're hiding under a rock, high-quality quercetin and CoQ10, especially in the winter, super immune system booster, cleans out all the cells, good for your whole body, so many amazing effects for the brain, the cardiovascular system,
[03:33:23.930 --> 03:33:34.229]  and these are high-end quality CoQ10 and quercetin, Similar brands, this is a private label top brand, sell for $60, $70 for this same dose.
[03:33:34.450 --> 03:33:37.629]  This is 40% off right now.
[03:33:37.809 --> 03:33:43.950]  You're not going to find a better deal on high-quality quercetin and CoQ10 than you are at drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:33:44.069 --> 03:33:55.590]  If you don't believe me, just go ask, chat, GPT, or do your own research on quercetin, on CoQ10, and on methylfolate as well, and do your research about how bad fluoride is for you.
[03:33:55.629 --> 03:33:56.090]  Ha, ha, ha.
[03:33:56.329 --> 03:33:57.469]  Alex Jones is nuts.
[03:33:57.959 --> 03:33:59.559]  Just like seed oils are so deadly.
[03:33:59.760 --> 03:34:00.719]  That's been known forever.
[03:34:01.059 --> 03:34:02.959]  Formerly machine oil is what they were used for.
[03:34:03.219 --> 03:34:09.819]  And now the leftists are out drinking seed oil saying, we love it, we want it, keep feeding it to us because they can't admit they've been conned.
[03:34:09.940 --> 03:34:13.860]  They can't admit they're in a death cult that wants to have them be depopulated.
[03:34:14.040 --> 03:34:16.040]  And I see the left taking the poison shots.
[03:34:16.159 --> 03:34:16.780]  They're 10th boosters.
[03:34:17.360 --> 03:34:21.860]  I see the left basically committing suicide against themselves and not having children.
[03:34:22.059 --> 03:34:25.040]  And people say, hey, don't interrupt the enemy when they're destroying themselves.
[03:34:25.040 --> 03:34:26.440]  I don't see you as an enemy.
[03:34:27.149 --> 03:34:39.729]  And I want you to come out of your cult and just realize that fluoride's really bad for you, and so are seed oils, and CoQ10, of course, is really good for you, and these are great products at drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:34:40.229 --> 03:34:43.790]  Again, federal judge said again, import was never sold.
[03:34:43.909 --> 03:34:44.610]  There was no sale.
[03:34:44.709 --> 03:34:46.129]  Stop saying it in court yesterday.
[03:34:46.790 --> 03:34:50.590]  Now he's going to have hearings on whether that was even legal, an investigation.
[03:34:51.940 --> 03:34:56.520]  So, we are still on air because you're supporting us, and our Legal Defense Fund is now an offense fund.
[03:34:56.700 --> 03:35:02.879]  Plus, these are great products you want, drjoesnaturals.com, and that will continue to keep us on the air.
[03:35:02.979 --> 03:35:04.940]  Plus, these are amazing products you want.
[03:35:05.139 --> 03:35:08.780]  Thank you so much for myself and the entire InfoWars crew.
[03:35:09.120 --> 03:35:10.639]  I'm sorry for the Flat Earthers.
[03:35:10.659 --> 03:35:11.659]  I still love you.
[03:35:13.420 --> 03:35:16.399]  Oh, my baby, my globe, my sweetie cake.
[03:35:16.559 --> 03:35:17.780]  Oh, I love the globe.
[03:35:18.299 --> 03:35:19.879]  Oh, those flat others are so bad.
[03:35:20.000 --> 03:35:20.860]  Eddie Bravo's not around.
[03:35:21.079 --> 03:35:22.040]  Wake the fuck up!
[03:35:23.600 --> 03:35:24.799]  Wake the fuck up!
[03:35:26.850 --> 03:35:27.569]  Wait, wait.
[03:35:28.049 --> 03:35:29.229]  Wait, what is this, Alex?
[03:35:29.450 --> 03:35:29.989]  Wait, wait.
[03:35:30.170 --> 03:35:30.569]  I'm sorry.
[03:35:30.729 --> 03:35:31.110]  I'm sorry.
[03:35:31.350 --> 03:35:32.010]  Oh, my God!
[03:35:32.989 --> 03:35:33.389]  Alex!
[03:35:33.989 --> 03:35:35.190]  It is round!
[03:35:35.350 --> 03:35:36.090]  Oh, my God!
[03:35:36.350 --> 03:35:37.770]  How come you didn't tell me?
[03:35:37.930 --> 03:35:38.870]  You didn't tell me?
[03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:40.729]  What did you get this?
[03:35:42.110 --> 03:35:43.450]  I've been lied to.
[03:35:43.889 --> 03:35:44.709]  It's round.
[03:35:44.989 --> 03:35:45.709]  Oh, my God.
[03:35:45.750 --> 03:35:46.670]  I'm so sorry, Alex.
[03:35:46.809 --> 03:35:47.270]  I'm so sorry.
[03:35:47.290 --> 03:35:47.290]  It's okay.
[03:35:47.309 --> 03:35:47.549]  It's okay.
[03:35:47.690 --> 03:35:48.549]  I'm so sorry!
[03:35:48.709 --> 03:35:49.530]  I'm so sorry!
[03:35:49.770 --> 03:35:50.770]  The proof's real, see?
[03:35:50.889 --> 03:35:51.309]  Hold on!
[03:35:52.100 --> 03:35:52.840]  Look at that!
[03:35:53.100 --> 03:35:54.219]  And that's real, too.
[03:35:54.520 --> 03:35:56.219]  Now get over here and tell us how it's flat.
[03:35:57.840 --> 03:35:58.440]  It's flat.
[03:35:58.600 --> 03:35:59.200]  No, it's flat.
[03:35:59.260 --> 03:35:59.680]  I give up.
[03:35:59.819 --> 03:36:00.059]  It's flat.
[03:36:00.100 --> 03:36:00.680]  No, I agree.
[03:36:00.840 --> 03:36:01.440]  It's flat.
[03:36:01.620 --> 03:36:01.940]  Fuck it.
[03:36:02.120 --> 03:36:03.379]  And Joe Biden won the election.
[03:36:03.559 --> 03:36:04.219]  Fuck you!
[03:36:05.219 --> 03:36:06.280]  Goddamn this fucking...
[03:36:06.280 --> 03:36:06.299]  There we go.
[03:36:06.559 --> 03:36:06.719]  Nice.
[03:36:11.840 --> 03:36:13.059]  Goddamn this fucking thing.
[03:36:13.700 --> 03:36:14.360]  Jesus Christ.
[03:36:14.540 --> 03:36:15.540]  Yeah, come on, play soccer.
[03:36:15.639 --> 03:36:15.959]  Come on.
[03:36:22.270 --> 03:36:23.149]  It is round.
[03:36:23.389 --> 03:36:23.969]  Throw it at me.
[03:36:24.190 --> 03:36:25.030]  I was wrong!
[03:36:25.209 --> 03:36:25.709]  Throw it at me.
[03:36:27.430 --> 03:36:27.950]  Why?
[03:36:30.430 --> 03:36:31.270]  Watch this!
[03:36:31.809 --> 03:36:32.649]  We'll defeat it.
[03:36:33.629 --> 03:36:34.250]  Hold on.
[03:36:34.569 --> 03:36:35.690]  We're defeating it right now.
[03:36:36.549 --> 03:36:38.129]  Look at that son of a bitch!
[03:36:39.069 --> 03:36:40.870]  I just pulled out a control panel.
[03:36:41.670 --> 03:36:42.049]  Damn it.
[03:36:44.670 --> 03:36:46.129]  Down with the earth!
[03:36:46.530 --> 03:36:47.750]  Biden is president!
[03:36:48.170 --> 03:36:49.010]  Down with Trump!
[03:36:53.219 --> 03:36:53.600]  See?
[03:36:53.819 --> 03:36:54.260]  It's real.
[03:36:54.459 --> 03:36:55.280]  It's round, Eddie.
[03:36:55.459 --> 03:36:56.040]  I know, Alex.
[03:36:56.139 --> 03:36:56.559]  I know.
[03:36:56.780 --> 03:36:57.920]  You were wrong to hit me.
[03:36:58.020 --> 03:36:58.540]  You're sorry.
[03:36:58.700 --> 03:36:59.360]  I fucked up.
[03:36:59.459 --> 03:37:01.200]  I didn't know this existed.
[03:37:01.659 --> 03:37:02.500]  Oh, my God.
[03:37:02.600 --> 03:37:03.719]  This proves it.
[03:37:04.799 --> 03:37:05.799]  What have I done?
[03:37:06.139 --> 03:37:07.000]  What have you done?
[03:37:07.739 --> 03:37:09.020]  Eddie, wake the fuck up.
[03:37:09.159 --> 03:37:09.479]  Stop it.
[03:37:12.059 --> 03:37:15.219]  Don't ever question flat earth again, okay?
[03:37:15.479 --> 03:37:15.860]  I won't.
[03:37:15.879 --> 03:37:16.600]  You know I love you.
[03:37:16.700 --> 03:37:17.319]  It's flat.
[03:37:17.899 --> 03:37:18.600]  There you go.
[03:37:18.639 --> 03:37:19.840]  And Donald Trump's guilty.
[03:37:20.000 --> 03:37:20.479]  I told you.
[03:37:20.579 --> 03:37:20.879]  Shh.
[03:37:21.399 --> 03:37:23.899]  My president is, is Joe Biden!
[03:37:25.120 --> 03:37:26.219]  I told you!
[03:37:26.459 --> 03:37:27.840]  I fucking told you it's flat!
[03:37:27.959 --> 03:37:28.500]  You did, it's flat.
[03:37:28.540 --> 03:37:29.659]  You don't fucking believe me!
[03:37:29.760 --> 03:37:30.239]  It's flat.
[03:37:38.670 --> 03:37:39.829]  DrJonesNational.com.
[03:37:40.350 --> 03:37:42.250]  The flat earth will expose it.
[03:37:54.770 --> 03:37:57.110]  They basically almost destroyed my parents.
[03:37:57.209 --> 03:38:03.629]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family that might have been at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits the Democrats filed.
[03:38:03.829 --> 03:38:07.629]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are $316 million yesterday.
[03:38:08.030 --> 03:38:10.590]  They filed before they spent $80 million suing me.
[03:38:10.829 --> 03:38:12.430]  We spent $16 million fighting them.
[03:38:12.670 --> 03:38:14.290]  My dad spent $2 million fighting them.
[03:38:14.350 --> 03:38:15.450]  And we're finally winning.
[03:38:15.670 --> 03:38:26.969]  Not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnaturals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request I ask you to support him because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[03:38:27.090 --> 03:38:29.610]  He was giving everything to Infowars.
[03:38:29.790 --> 03:38:37.129]  And then personally going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me because that's how dads are.
[03:38:37.530 --> 03:38:38.670]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[03:38:38.809 --> 03:38:43.690]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office.
[03:38:43.870 --> 03:38:44.930]  And I got pissed.
[03:38:45.549 --> 03:38:52.670]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[03:38:53.340 --> 03:38:54.379]  The supplements are there.
[03:38:54.540 --> 03:38:55.180]  They're great.
[03:38:55.360 --> 03:38:56.540]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[03:38:56.620 --> 03:38:57.879]  He's put everything into it he has.
[03:38:57.979 --> 03:38:58.540]  They're incredible.
[03:38:58.819 --> 03:39:08.500]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, that I don't want to belabor this.
[03:39:08.540 --> 03:39:09.799]  We have important topics to cover.
[03:39:10.639 --> 03:39:11.879]  Please support us.
[03:39:12.059 --> 03:39:14.100]  Go to drjonesdactuals.com.

[03:39:31.959 --> 03:39:32.739]  A big sale.
[03:39:32.959 --> 03:39:40.639]  And my dad literally took a loan last week to be able to buy the product that's coming in finally next week.
[03:39:40.819 --> 03:39:42.920]  Turbo Force, things like that that are popular.
[03:39:43.100 --> 03:39:45.620]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[03:39:46.139 --> 03:39:50.120]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[03:39:50.440 --> 03:39:51.780]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[03:39:51.920 --> 03:39:52.540]  He's a fighter.
[03:39:52.659 --> 03:39:53.520]  Hell, he's my dad.
[03:39:53.659 --> 03:39:54.620]  I think I'm a fighter.
[03:39:54.840 --> 03:39:56.260]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[03:39:56.920 --> 03:40:04.440]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[03:40:04.620 --> 03:40:07.299]  But at this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[03:40:07.440 --> 03:40:08.379]  It's about my parents.
[03:40:08.979 --> 03:40:14.500]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's what the enemy targeted them.
[03:40:16.159 --> 03:40:17.979]  Please, support the Infowar today.
[03:40:18.139 --> 03:40:20.100]  Support my mother and my father.
[03:40:20.159 --> 03:40:23.079]  I'm asking you personally for you to do it now.

[03:40:26.100 --> 03:40:27.819]  All our problems will be over in one minute.
[03:40:27.940 --> 03:40:33.459]  But it's less than one-half, one percent that ever buy anything from drjonesnagros.com, thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:40:33.540 --> 03:40:37.120]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight for our futures.
[03:40:37.520 --> 03:40:40.780]  So, thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnagros.com.
[03:40:40.860 --> 03:40:42.379]  I'm going to shut up at the balance of this hour.
