[00:00:18.412 --> 00:00:21.895]  But you know, I think it's time to finish the job here.
[00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:24.168]  I think it's time for us to.
[00:00:24.848 --> 00:00:27.230]  This motherfucker was a plant, Joe Biden.
[00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.631]  He was put into power.
[00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:36.315]  Illegally, he was then utilized to be the figurehead that was perceived to be incompetent to destroy our country.
[00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:42.539]  If you look at what he's done and you look at the damage that he's created, this man was put in power to do that damage.
[00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:47.182]  And then for all of us who say, oh, look, he's so dumb, he doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:50.244]  There's nothing dumb about what these people are doing.
[00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:51.965]  The dumb motherfucker is Joe Biden.
[00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:54.427]  Have they had a competent leader in there?
[00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:56.609]  Let's say they had a Barack Obama.
[00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.411]  They would look at that guy and they would say, dude, that guy's a traitor.
[00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:03.654]  So they needed someone who looked incompetent to do what they've done.
[00:01:03.794 --> 00:01:10.340]  And that's another reason why they're pushing Kamala now, because the job isn't done, which coincidentally is their slogan.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.521]  Let's finish the job.
[00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:13.522]  Our economic plan is working.
[00:01:14.163 --> 00:01:15.724]  We now have to finish the job.
[00:01:15.844 --> 00:01:16.745]  There's more to do.
[00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:17.926]  Biden was
[00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:19.990]  Stole the election 2020.
[00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:28.016]  We have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud
[00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:34.044]  This dude got his freaking work permit and social security card, came here illegally, got documented,
[00:01:54.281 --> 00:02:13.444]  Got on the buses from Texas to Chicago and now within four months this guy's got his social security card, he's got his worker's identification card for working, he's got a driver's license, he's got insurance, he just bought a car all in four months and has an efficiency apartment that he pays $500 a month for.
[00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:18.167]  Pennsylvania was registering non-citizens for 20 years, and they admit it!
[00:02:18.827 --> 00:02:20.208]  This is not subject to debate.
[00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:27.531]  And so then, sticking with the topic of non-citizen voting, isn't it true that this November, non-citizens that reside in D.C.
[00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:30.912]  for simply 30 days can vote in D.C.
[00:02:31.052 --> 00:02:31.873]  municipal elections?
[00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:33.093]  That's correct.
[00:02:33.473 --> 00:02:34.274]  And D.C.
[00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:38.116]  also mails every registered voter a ballot, correct?
[00:02:38.276 --> 00:02:38.576]  Correct.
[00:02:39.176 --> 00:02:50.305]  And so, you're telling me that in Washington, D.C., if there is even a small clerical mistake, non-citizens could be mailed a ballot with federal races on them?
[00:02:50.865 --> 00:02:51.666]  That's correct.
[00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:55.029]  We found several other things using open source data.
[00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.452]  There is a gentleman named Eric Lutzen.
[00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:02.314]  He has matched up a list.
[00:03:02.354 --> 00:03:12.519]  He started looking at voters above the age of 80 that were registered for voting and did vote in Michigan.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.223]  And 17,327 Michigan voters also had a corresponding obituary.
[00:03:20.404 --> 00:03:22.244]  They were on the voter rolls with the birth date of 1850.
[00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.893]  There were 232 people registered to vote with an address to our local prisons.
[00:03:29.913 --> 00:03:33.055]  There were 4,144 people that were 90 years old and older.
[00:03:38.122 --> 00:03:48.727]  There were 125 people registered to vote or on the voter rolls that were registered to, or their address comes back to non-profit NGOs and different businesses.
[00:03:49.768 --> 00:03:54.250]  There were 300 people, approximately 300 people with no first name, just the last name.
[00:03:56.551 --> 00:04:05.135]  There were about 110 people that were possible double voters, basically the same name, date of birth, address, but two different voter ID numbers.
[00:04:06.572 --> 00:04:10.333]  People registered to vote at various shelters and all that.
[00:04:11.853 --> 00:04:14.734]  We even found one person on the voter rolls by the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:04:15.274 --> 00:04:24.376]  And now they're finishing up organizing that, and they will move into high gear with all the things they believe will destabilize things and create enough fear to keep them in power.
[00:04:25.276 --> 00:04:35.218]  So they're going to strengthen the powers of the executive if they get their puppet in, but they're also preparing to strip powers and strip powers from the Supreme Court by packing the court and adding a whole bunch of new members.
[00:04:36.863 --> 00:04:40.065]  But they control, so they've got all these things pre-programmed ready.
[00:04:40.525 --> 00:04:47.229]  Yeah, well I think we've got all the Democrats who are ready for meaningful ethics reform to bind the Supreme Court.
[00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.931]  And we're working on changes to the Supreme Court.
[00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:58.276]  It can be term limits, it could be adding the number of justices, things we can do without having to have a constitutional amendment.
[00:04:58.696 --> 00:05:01.598]  Here is a man who's been a transformative president.
[00:05:01.638 --> 00:05:03.319]  He's gotten an enormous amount done.
[00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.480]  And yet he has stepped away, and he has passed the torch.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.321]  And when they're ready to deliver the meal of tyranny, they pull out the meal and they serve the poisoned feast.
[00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:19.083]  Well, the world government, the satanic New World Order, is out in the open, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:19.603 --> 00:05:24.784]  Thank you for joining us on this Monday, July 29th, 2024 transmission.
[00:05:25.485 --> 00:05:28.666]  I'll be here live for the next four hours, and then Owen Schroyer, 3 p.m.
[00:05:28.686 --> 00:05:30.266]  Central, with The War Room.
[00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:35.579]  All right.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.442]  Trump is saying so many powerful, truthful things that are game-changing.
[00:05:39.502 --> 00:05:40.562]  It's hard to keep track of them all.
[00:05:41.363 --> 00:05:58.614]  But yesterday, when he did two rallies, incredible, in Minnesota and in places like Nashville, he came out and said, the globalists want to depopulate the humans.
[00:06:00.215 --> 00:06:01.716]  He said, they don't want to just get rid of the cows.
[00:06:04.025 --> 00:06:09.554]  As they're doing in Europe and other areas and trying here, they want to get rid of the people, which is true, which you all know.
[00:06:12.198 --> 00:06:14.182]  But now to have Trump
[00:06:16.451 --> 00:06:23.874]  Calling the globalist Deep State out to their faces on their main pillar, their main agenda item, is so key.
[00:06:23.914 --> 00:06:25.255]  It's not just Elon Musk doing it.
[00:06:25.295 --> 00:06:26.515]  It's not just Alex Jones doing it.
[00:06:27.116 --> 00:06:28.416]  It's not just Tucker Carlson doing it.
[00:06:28.436 --> 00:06:34.919]  It's not just Joe Rogan doing it and Russell Brand doing it and Naomi Wolf doing it and the list goes on and on.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.221]  JFK, RFK Jr., all of them.
[00:06:42.022 --> 00:06:44.283]  It's very, very positive to get to that point.
[00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:45.784]  So I'm going to be talking about that.
[00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:52.020]  Coming up and really getting into it at the bottom of the hour here in about 25 minutes.
[00:06:53.461 --> 00:06:59.646]  Let me just do as I do at the beginning of many shows and just broadcast and let you know what we've got coming up here.
[00:07:02.468 --> 00:07:12.936]  We have clear cut and dry election interference by Google delisting searches of Trump starting on Saturday.
[00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:18.898]  After it got attention from Elon Musk and others, they reversed it as of this morning.
[00:07:20.359 --> 00:07:22.421]  I woke up at 4 a.m.
[00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:28.947]  this morning, checked it and they were still blocking all basic Trump searches, particular ones about the attempted assassination.
[00:07:29.648 --> 00:07:34.052]  You type in Donald and you'd get Donald Duck and you just couldn't get anything under Trump.
[00:07:35.153 --> 00:07:37.815]  And then as of getting into the office at about 9 a.m.
[00:07:37.856 --> 00:07:40.178]  this morning, I researched it and
[00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:52.103]  All the Trump searches are working, which shows when pressure gets put on them, they try to sweep it under the rug, but then they're doing it in so many, really millions of ways.
[00:07:52.503 --> 00:08:11.586]  And that's what Professor Epstein, the Congress eight years ago, and six years ago, and a few years ago, testified to, that just Google's gaming with over 90% of world search results, 90 plus percent, like 91% is the last number I saw of all searches in the world are done on Google, by gaming that,
[00:08:13.706 --> 00:08:26.190]  On every subject you can imagine, from open borders, to military operations, disasters, to fentanyl deaths, to drag queen story time, they are there, an essential part of the censorship complex.
[00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:33.493]  So we've got that big stack of news, election interference, Google omits auto-complete search results for failed Trump assassination.
[00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:36.274]  It would just give you Donald Duck.
[00:08:38.835 --> 00:08:41.996]  Election interference must weigh in on Google's search ban on Trump.
[00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.531]  Tommy Robinson spoke to crowds of tens of thousands peacefully about the Islamic invasion.
[00:08:50.551 --> 00:08:52.831]  He was arrested again under anti-terror laws.
[00:08:53.911 --> 00:08:55.032]  Shows where the free speech is going.
[00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.812]  Google memory holes attempted assassination of Trump.
[00:08:58.552 --> 00:08:59.973]  Another article on Infowars.com.
[00:09:00.553 --> 00:09:02.653]  That is one of the stacks.
[00:09:04.493 --> 00:09:07.394]  That Tommy Robinson article snuck in there, but I was intending to cover that as well.
[00:09:07.574 --> 00:09:10.315]  I'm glad it snuck in there because I forgot to get that out of my stack.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.021]  Another big angle we're going to be getting into.
[00:09:15.201 --> 00:09:31.333]  FBI confirms Donald Trump was struck by a bullet during July 13th assassination attempt as major Democrat Party spokespersons all over CNN, all over MSNBC, and all over everywhere are saying nobody got shot.
[00:09:31.373 --> 00:09:32.373]  The whole thing's fake.
[00:09:33.594 --> 00:09:41.680]  When you can see it on live television, and you can't fake something that real, but because his ear didn't blow off, because they don't understand ballistics,
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:52.824]  They're saying, well, if a big old bullet hit you and they show a whole cartridge on TV, the full cartridge that isn't fired out the barrel for Democrats that don't understand that, don't know how to find their ass in both hands.
[00:09:53.544 --> 00:09:55.425]  He was grazed in the ear.
[00:09:56.486 --> 00:10:01.568]  And I almost told this story, but it's kind of an embarrassing story.
[00:10:02.728 --> 00:10:05.009]  And plus it doesn't even sound real for most people.
[00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:09.271]  So I didn't tell the story, but I have been shot.
[00:10:10.575 --> 00:10:15.058]  With a .22 caliber round in the ear when I was nine years old.
[00:10:16.439 --> 00:10:17.660]  I don't like to put down guns.
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.862]  It was deliberate.
[00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.164]  And it was a big freakout.
[00:10:23.224 --> 00:10:25.026]  And it was a .22 caliber air rifle.
[00:10:25.846 --> 00:10:26.747]  It's .22 caliber.
[00:10:26.887 --> 00:10:28.788]  Same caliber as a .22 round.
[00:10:28.808 --> 00:10:35.333]  Not as heavy or long as a .556, but .556 itself is .22 caliber.
[00:10:38.749 --> 00:10:52.831]  And I was not grazed in the ear, I was hit directly in the back from the front and it blew a hole out the back and bled quite a bit, but within days there was just a purple spot because the cartilage came back in.
[00:10:53.452 --> 00:11:00.413]  You can look at Trump's ear and see the grazing and see how cartilage bleeds a lot, but then it becomes flesh colored within days.
[00:11:00.813 --> 00:11:07.654]  You can see in blobs of his ear where the scar is now, but cartilage is different than
[00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:22.828]  Other types of open skin where it appears red or orange after a few days, it doesn't because there's only the blood on the surface because cartilage is basically solid compared to fat or muscle.
[00:11:24.188 --> 00:11:35.916]  And I experienced this myself when my dad would bring kids down from school, lots of my friends, football, you name it, to our ranch.
[00:11:36.852 --> 00:11:49.379]  One time he dropped me and a kid I'd known for a couple of years who seemed nice named Michael off, and my grandmother did not like him though, and she would always let me take the guns out and stuff, but this time she said, you know, I talked to that kid, she was a school teacher, I don't really like him, she was very honest.
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:57.224]  She said, don't bring him back here, because I guess she would sit there and talk to us at dinner, she was like, the kid's a liar, I don't like him, I thought he was a nice kid.
[00:11:58.191 --> 00:12:02.373]  And then my dad and mom pulled up two days later to pick us up and take us back to Dallas, because the ranch was two hours from Dallas.
[00:12:02.673 --> 00:12:04.013]  I spent a lot of weekends there, as I've said.
[00:12:05.194 --> 00:12:08.935]  And my grandmother would only let us take out the pellet guns that were there.
[00:12:08.955 --> 00:12:10.856]  Well, the pellet guns had belonged to my dad and my uncle.
[00:12:10.876 --> 00:12:11.596]  They were like vintage.
[00:12:12.116 --> 00:12:18.118]  They were the old .22 caliber, single pump, high-powered ones, where it's really hard to even do the one pump.
[00:12:19.439 --> 00:12:22.360]  And we're getting ready to leave, and we get in an argument, and I had a regular
[00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:24.730]  B.B.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:04.085]  Where, uh, I grew up in a golf course community in Rockwall, Texas, and back then it wasn't built up like it is now inside Dallas.
[00:13:05.322 --> 00:13:10.566]  And so there were hundreds of acres of ranch land by railroad tracks that were behind the neighborhood.
[00:13:10.766 --> 00:13:12.468]  And there were creek bottoms back there.
[00:13:13.308 --> 00:13:17.211]  And when I say ranch, sometimes there were cows on it, but not normally.
[00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:18.052]  It was mainly woods.
[00:13:18.792 --> 00:13:19.913]  Somebody would rotate cows through there.
[00:13:19.933 --> 00:13:23.336]  We would trespass on it and hike around in there.
[00:13:23.356 --> 00:13:25.498]  And I'd get together with neighborhood kids.
[00:13:26.638 --> 00:13:28.400]  And I was trained in firearms and training safety.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.083]  But one time, six or seven of us were down there running around, shooting and doing stuff.
[00:13:33.804 --> 00:13:34.484]  And another kid
[00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:36.275]  Shot me in the leg.
[00:13:37.396 --> 00:13:38.797]  And the BB is still there.
[00:13:38.937 --> 00:13:40.538]  It was deeper in the muscle as I got older.
[00:13:40.558 --> 00:13:41.559]  It's worked out at the surface.
[00:13:42.199 --> 00:13:45.461]  And you can actually see it on the surface under my skin, a bump.
[00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:47.503]  And I've intended to have it removed.
[00:13:47.643 --> 00:13:49.384]  In fact, I keep saying I am.
[00:13:49.404 --> 00:13:50.345]  I never get around to it.
[00:13:50.365 --> 00:13:53.206]  I think I'm going to get some doctor to remove it.
[00:13:53.226 --> 00:13:54.747]  I think I'm going to shoot video of it.
[00:13:54.787 --> 00:13:56.088]  This is an interesting little aside.
[00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:59.010]  But so I've been shot in the leg and I've got a BB in there.
[00:13:59.991 --> 00:14:01.152]  Regular BB caliber.
[00:14:02.284 --> 00:14:02.664]  What is it?
[00:14:02.684 --> 00:14:03.865]  177 or whatever they call it.
[00:14:04.585 --> 00:14:10.727]  And then I've got a 22 caliber pellet gun exit point back here.
[00:14:11.428 --> 00:14:12.988]  Like I said, right to the ear, right to the back.
[00:14:13.008 --> 00:14:16.990]  So it's interesting that I've been basically shot in the same place as Trump.
[00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:17.910]  True story.
[00:14:18.631 --> 00:14:19.411]  But I've already told the story.
[00:14:19.431 --> 00:14:20.712]  I said, coming up, I'll tell you about it.
[00:14:21.472 --> 00:14:26.594]  But massive denials, massive denials that
[00:14:28.857 --> 00:14:43.281]  That happened to Trump and it just shows some of the very same big leftist accounts and national TV host have demonized me for questioning Sandy Hook happening when all I did was cover the internet questioning it.
[00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:49.003]  I never created it, only set it off and on on like maybe five, six shows and 22 minutes of evidence.
[00:14:49.083 --> 00:14:51.924]  They sued me five, six years after I'd even really talked about it.
[00:14:52.995 --> 00:14:54.016]  And then lied about what I did.
[00:14:54.036 --> 00:14:55.236]  They said I sent people to their houses.
[00:14:55.296 --> 00:14:56.177]  I peed on graves.
[00:14:56.637 --> 00:14:57.537]  I made money off of them.
[00:14:57.577 --> 00:14:58.138]  None of that's true.
[00:14:58.158 --> 00:14:59.598]  They put fake evidence on.
[00:14:59.618 --> 00:15:00.679]  I was already found guilty.
[00:15:00.999 --> 00:15:01.720]  I couldn't counter it.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.860]  Just totally made up crap.
[00:15:05.181 --> 00:15:13.926]  And then the very same people saying I am Satan incarnate for doing things I never even did are all over the place saying nobody was shot.
[00:15:13.986 --> 00:15:14.666]  It's all fake.
[00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:15.547]  It's totally staged.
[00:15:17.828 --> 00:15:18.268]  Incredible.
[00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:21.370]  But listen, they shouldn't be censored.
[00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:25.671]  They shouldn't be censored.
[00:15:27.672 --> 00:15:31.396]  They have a right to say the pigs fly if they want.
[00:15:31.416 --> 00:15:33.077]  They have a right to say the moon is made of cheese.
[00:15:33.097 --> 00:15:34.538]  They have a right to be wrong.
[00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:36.440]  And a right to their opinion.
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.102]  I had a right to say I thought day one Jussie Smollett was staged.
[00:15:39.443 --> 00:15:40.163]  It turned out it was.
[00:15:40.564 --> 00:15:42.485]  But if I was wrong, I have a right to say I think this is staged.
[00:15:43.006 --> 00:15:44.467]  And they have a right to say they think it's staged.
[00:15:45.648 --> 00:15:51.153]  But the idea that I cut my teeth on or was known
[00:15:52.888 --> 00:15:59.371]  Sandy Hook is preposterous, and when prominent people, and I'll leave it at that, well, they've actually been pretty public about it.
[00:16:00.692 --> 00:16:04.694]  Tucker Carlson went to bat to Elon Musk without me even knowing, told me about it a little bit later.
[00:16:06.374 --> 00:16:10.156]  Kim Dotcom went to bat for me and told me about it later, which you saw him say on air.
[00:16:10.897 --> 00:16:12.237]  And so did some other prominent people.
[00:16:12.938 --> 00:16:17.800]  And they said to Elon, you know he wasn't banned off X for saying nobody died at Sandy Hook and attacking families.
[00:16:19.463 --> 00:16:24.489]  And Elon finally, he said this in an interview that I did with him two and a half hours, famously.
[00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:30.555]  He pulled that up, had like 50 million views on X. He said, no, I know you're telling the truth, Mr. Jones.
[00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:31.837]  I went and pulled the logs.
[00:16:32.678 --> 00:16:36.122]  He went through the whole history, everything I've ever posted, everything that's ever been deleted, everything.
[00:16:36.142 --> 00:16:36.822]  They have a whole history.
[00:16:36.842 --> 00:16:37.063]  He goes.
[00:16:38.885 --> 00:16:40.206]  There was no coverage of Sandy Hook.
[00:16:40.226 --> 00:16:42.587]  You never said any of this on our platform, and you were not banned for that.
[00:16:43.248 --> 00:16:51.633]  You were banned for confronting Oliver Darcy, the CNN reporter, at the congressional halls on a hearing about me and censorship that I was not allowed to be part of.
[00:16:51.653 --> 00:16:53.714]  That's why I went there, so I'd be in the audience.
[00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:57.757]  And I confront him and say, how dare you run around and try to get me censored everywhere?
[00:16:58.177 --> 00:16:59.077]  And then he complained.
[00:16:59.117 --> 00:17:00.098]  They called it bullying.
[00:17:01.379 --> 00:17:02.299]  And that's why I was banned.
[00:17:02.339 --> 00:17:03.900]  In fact, there's even the CEO
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.402]  At the time, and also the head lawyer, remember, on Joe Rogan with Tim Pool?
[00:17:09.022 --> 00:17:12.464]  Now like, what was it, like four years ago?
[00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:18.668]  And they pull up the logs there, with their iPhones, and say he was banned for this.
[00:17:19.708 --> 00:17:25.772]  So, everybody thinks I got banned five years ago for Sandy Hook.
[00:17:25.852 --> 00:17:27.273]  It wasn't even on the radar.
[00:17:27.913 --> 00:17:29.013]  I wasn't known for that.
[00:17:29.374 --> 00:17:31.415]  It's not something, it was like, it's ridiculous.
[00:17:32.759 --> 00:17:39.764]  And so they dredged it all up, had a PR firm run thousands of articles that I was peeing on graves and making money off these people.
[00:17:40.664 --> 00:17:47.869]  They did all this discovery, mixed it all up, cooked it up, misrepresented it, then said I didn't give them discovery, defaulted me, had a show trial.
[00:17:47.889 --> 00:17:51.271]  The reason I raise that is it's important to understand how these folks operate.
[00:17:52.592 --> 00:17:57.936]  They said last week, and it was put all over national news, that JD Vance had sex with his couch.
[00:17:58.976 --> 00:17:59.897]  No one ever said that.
[00:17:59.937 --> 00:18:00.977]  He didn't say that in his book.
[00:18:01.018 --> 00:18:06.301]  They even said it was definitive in his book that he liked to have sex with his couch cushions.
[00:18:08.223 --> 00:18:09.123]  It's totally made up.
[00:18:09.143 --> 00:18:19.651]  Remember, they still say that, Biden even did it again, that Trump said that Hispanics, that Mexicans are all bad people.
[00:18:19.871 --> 00:18:20.832]  Never said anything close to that.
[00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:29.066]  And so this is what they do, but they just say it, and say it, and say it, and say it, and say it, and say it.
[00:18:29.646 --> 00:18:31.267]  Now here's an example of something innocuous.
[00:18:32.969 --> 00:18:34.710]  There's only one thing I'm better known as.
[00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:35.471]  Then I'll get into all the news.
[00:18:35.511 --> 00:18:36.912]  This is important to understand how propaganda works.
[00:18:38.053 --> 00:18:41.295]  I went to pick up my seven-year-old daughter from summer camp yesterday.
[00:18:41.315 --> 00:18:43.297]  Wow, didn't do the nighttime show.
[00:18:44.462 --> 00:18:47.644]  I just had to pick her up at, like, three o'clock by the time I got back from the Hill Country.
[00:18:47.664 --> 00:18:48.885]  It's an hour and a half drive.
[00:18:48.965 --> 00:18:49.905]  It's too late to do the show.
[00:18:49.945 --> 00:18:51.166]  Chase's guys did a great job.
[00:18:51.867 --> 00:18:53.147]  I watched a lot of it once I got home.
[00:18:53.188 --> 00:18:54.248]  I got home when the show started.
[00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:02.373]  And when I got there, I got mobbed by the camp counselors and by the kids and by everybody and by the people.
[00:19:02.393 --> 00:19:03.494]  They're almost all listeners.
[00:19:04.715 --> 00:19:06.256]  And it's a big camp, Christian camp.
[00:19:08.482 --> 00:19:15.044]  They all wanted me to, not all, I mean, half of them wanted me to pose with their camera or, hey, my mom's a big fan, say something about gay frogs.
[00:19:15.664 --> 00:19:23.707]  And then my middle daughter, who's a camp counselor there, she's 16, Georgia runs up with a whole bunch of people that are fans.
[00:19:24.267 --> 00:19:25.488]  She's on the work detail there.
[00:19:26.768 --> 00:19:29.329]  And they all wanted me to sit there and talk about gay frogs to them.
[00:19:29.949 --> 00:19:36.071]  Not one person wanted me to talk about Sandy Hook.
[00:19:36.211 --> 00:19:37.632]  They all wanted to talk about gay frogs.
[00:19:38.723 --> 00:19:46.967]  And that's an example how one thing you do, or one thing you say out of context, when the media runs with it, becomes what you are.
[00:19:47.027 --> 00:20:07.097]  Now, I did say the gay frog thing, and it was at the end of a long analysis with studies out of South Africa, studies out of California, studies out of Texas, studies out of China, that runoff from atrazine, even at allowable levels, bends the gender of male frogs, where the majority of them want to have sex with other male frogs, for whatever reason, and then their populations die.
[00:20:08.561 --> 00:20:16.045]  So I said I'm not against gay people in general, I'm against the chemicals in the water that turn the friggin frogs gay and by extension bend the gender of humans.
[00:20:17.205 --> 00:20:18.566]  And it is a fact that's going on.
[00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:30.832]  So, that's something innocuous that all the nightly news shows and comedy shows attack me, Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, all of them.
[00:20:32.421 --> 00:20:38.726]  Because they wanted to make a joke about it so you wouldn't investigate what is actually in the water supply, by design, bending gender.
[00:20:40.287 --> 00:20:47.913]  So, I should be known for Bohemian Grove, I should be known for helping get Trump elected, I should be known for exposing the New World Order and being dead on about hundreds of big topics.
[00:20:49.474 --> 00:20:50.415]  Instead, I'm known
[00:20:51.411 --> 00:20:53.592]  For gay frogs and Sandy Hook.
[00:20:53.612 --> 00:20:56.654]  Now, I deserve the gay frog thing because I said it.
[00:20:57.214 --> 00:21:00.376]  And it was true, but it was kind of just a rant at the end of a serious analysis.
[00:21:00.696 --> 00:21:08.901]  They didn't show any of the hour-long thing I did on gender-bending chemicals not just advertising the water, a real public service announcement back before anybody was really talking about it.
[00:21:09.982 --> 00:21:15.645]  But the system chose to make a joke about it so when people heard about chemicals in the water in the future, they would think it was a joke.
[00:21:16.285 --> 00:21:17.106]  It's not a joking matter.
[00:21:18.083 --> 00:21:31.581]  But on the Sandy Hook thing, those people, PR firms, have attached themselves to me to stay relevant, to do fundraisers in the hundreds of millions of dollars, reportedly, to lie about me and claim I did all these things to them, all cooked up by the CIA and the FBI.
[00:21:31.661 --> 00:21:34.765]  It's now come out in court and in documents and in undercover videos.
[00:21:35.726 --> 00:21:43.848]  As a way to demonize the populace, to sell people on supporting the destruction of the First Amendment six years ago, to then set the precedent for everybody else.
[00:21:44.148 --> 00:21:48.470]  And that's why it's historically important to mention that and to talk about that.
[00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.870]  And I'm done talking about it now.
[00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.711]  I'll plow back through all this news in great detail, I promise you.
[00:21:52.731 --> 00:21:56.412]  And then Judge Joe Brown, who knew Biden,
[00:21:58.144 --> 00:22:03.630]  When Brown goes way back and also knows all about Kamala and Willie Brown.
[00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:08.536]  He's going to drop the big secrets coming up in the third hour today.
[00:22:10.506 --> 00:22:16.912]  But I do also intend to open the phones up some in the second hour on the big subject of Trump coming out and saying, the globalists want to depopulate you.
[00:22:17.353 --> 00:22:18.514]  You're like, we already all know that.
[00:22:18.574 --> 00:22:19.575]  Well, no, you know that.
[00:22:20.176 --> 00:22:21.657]  The general public's starting to know that.
[00:22:21.717 --> 00:22:29.305]  But Trump getting on board with this is going to be seismic and a big deal, because when the public finally figures out the new world order agenda, it's game over for them.
[00:22:29.405 --> 00:22:31.767]  So that's where we're at.
[00:22:34.628 --> 00:22:45.114]  I've refused to watch the fake HBO documentary about me, but I have watched clips of it, and I have read transcripts of it, but I already knew what was going to be there because I was in the two trials that was scripted.
[00:22:45.594 --> 00:22:49.556]  They had scripts and stuff, and what we couldn't say, what we couldn't say, it was all just totally staged.
[00:22:50.677 --> 00:22:54.179]  I shouldn't even have participated in it, but I didn't understand how staged it was until I was in the middle of it.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.802]  And they have this fake garbage in there.
[00:23:00.728 --> 00:23:06.313]  Where they got all our discovery, all our sales numbers, emails, all our stuff, and then defaulted us and said we never gave them anything.
[00:23:06.353 --> 00:23:07.253]  Notice that's a lie right there.
[00:23:08.034 --> 00:23:13.559]  And then we used to, every two weeks, we wouldn't charge people for food they ordered.
[00:23:13.999 --> 00:23:15.520]  That was a big, hot time back then.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:16.561]  Restorable food still is.
[00:23:17.582 --> 00:23:18.863]  Why don't you wish you'd bought it then?
[00:23:19.023 --> 00:23:21.665]  It would have beat inflation for you.
[00:23:22.546 --> 00:23:29.532]  But every two weeks, they would... Then, once the food shipped out of Utah, we dropped ship from there,
[00:23:31.223 --> 00:23:32.624]  They would then run all the credit cards.
[00:23:32.644 --> 00:23:38.686]  So we wouldn't run your credit card, you'd make the order, and then when they told us, because they would do it the big run, in like one day.
[00:23:39.666 --> 00:23:40.487]  It's a huge factory.
[00:23:40.707 --> 00:23:41.387]  I've gone and shown you.
[00:23:41.407 --> 00:23:42.828]  It's the biggest warehouse I've ever seen.
[00:23:42.848 --> 00:23:44.268]  You can park a Star Destroyer in it.
[00:23:44.288 --> 00:23:45.209]  They got other ones around the country.
[00:23:46.849 --> 00:23:52.852]  And so, that two weeks of sales of food, gross sales was like $300,000.
[00:23:53.592 --> 00:23:57.734]  And then we had a new product, DNA Force Plus, come out then.
[00:23:58.837 --> 00:24:22.294]  And so, it was $400,000 in profit in one day, or not profit, in sales, gross sales, and they found one article of Don Salazar, wrote about Sandy Hook, that corresponded with that day, and they showed the jury that, that had already been found guilty, and said, look, he coordinated this $400,000, since most days we're bringing in like $30,000, as they show, with Sandy Hook.
[00:24:22.334 --> 00:24:26.457]  No, they just took 10 years of data, or by that time, eight years of data,
[00:24:27.608 --> 00:24:34.072]  Nine years of data, and they just lined it up and found some place that was a big spike around the same time and go, look, he made money.
[00:24:34.292 --> 00:24:47.099]  What the hell does running your food orders through because they shipped your food have to do with me, this dirty rat that's there rubbing my hands together?
[00:24:47.739 --> 00:24:50.601]  And I explained that, and they wouldn't let me get out of court.
[00:24:51.281 --> 00:24:55.324]  And they knew all that, and they understood that, and I explained that in depositions, and they knew that.
[00:24:56.124 --> 00:24:58.086]  A lot of you have been listening for 20 years.
[00:24:59.647 --> 00:25:04.470]  What I sell, I sell on air, products, and it has nothing to do with the news we're covering.
[00:25:05.331 --> 00:25:09.714]  Unless I see a story about poison in the water and I go, yeah, you should get our water filters, they're the highest rate, lowest price.
[00:25:09.994 --> 00:25:11.135]  It's all very clear.
[00:25:11.895 --> 00:25:19.841]  But I don't sit here, I've never had meetings with Don Salazar, who's still here, does a great job, about coordinating a story.
[00:25:19.861 --> 00:25:21.763]  What does it have to do with us?
[00:25:22.907 --> 00:25:25.468]  Okay, they ship the food, charge the credit cards.
[00:25:26.188 --> 00:25:32.311]  It's like those of you that pre-ordered the Trump bulletproof shirt.
[00:25:32.431 --> 00:25:33.532]  It's now in, it's now shipping.
[00:25:34.612 --> 00:25:36.393]  You saw on there, it said pre-order.
[00:25:37.013 --> 00:25:41.315]  Two weeks for delivery or longer, credit card will be charged when it ships.
[00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:47.896]  Well, I mean, we've sold, I think, 6,000 of the shirts, and I think they're gonna ship them, like, today, so they're about to charge it.
[00:25:48.117 --> 00:25:53.139]  You'll see a spike in our sales because it's two, three weeks of these, uh, of the shirts being sold.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:05.504]  And by their logic, because I talked about Sandy Hook today, when that runs through, and we bring in 50 grand or whatever it is, I haven't done the numbers, that means that money's theirs.
[00:26:05.645 --> 00:26:08.006]  No, it has nothing to do with you.
[00:26:08.046 --> 00:26:10.607]  It has to do with Trump getting shot and us talking about it.
[00:26:11.852 --> 00:26:18.075]  But again, that's the games they play and the deception they play, but I refuse to spend a lot of our time responding to this crap.
[00:26:19.316 --> 00:26:20.517]  But there, I just did.
[00:26:20.537 --> 00:26:25.339]  And the reason I am is, my mother only like twice a year asks me for something.
[00:26:28.661 --> 00:26:35.184]  And it's usually spend more time with your family, or go to church with me, or you know, come over and pray with us, stuff like that.
[00:26:36.185 --> 00:26:39.907]  But my mother asked me a month ago, she said, I want you to make a documentary about these people.
[00:26:40.915 --> 00:26:41.907]  I want you to expose them.
[00:26:43.482 --> 00:26:44.183]  I don't like this.
[00:26:44.283 --> 00:26:44.903]  I know they lied.
[00:26:44.923 --> 00:26:46.684]  I've seen the evidence, and I don't appreciate that.
[00:26:46.704 --> 00:26:48.325]  You're not perfect, but damn it, you didn't do this.
[00:26:49.146 --> 00:26:51.427]  So I'm going to do what she wants, and I want them to know that.
[00:26:51.688 --> 00:26:53.128]  I hate going through it.
[00:26:53.148 --> 00:26:54.009]  I hate talking about them.
[00:26:54.509 --> 00:27:00.894]  I hate going back to showing the PR firm and the CIA people and the FBI and the lawyers and all of them, but people have a right to know.
[00:27:01.214 --> 00:27:10.440]  It'll probably be like a 10-minute documentary, fast-moving, but just show from the start to finish what happened, what went down, how they did it, how they ran their disinfo operation.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.082]  And then just, you know, it might be 20 minutes because
[00:27:13.662 --> 00:27:15.044]  You know, there's so much to cover.
[00:27:15.965 --> 00:27:17.506]  It's just, it's despicable.
[00:27:18.447 --> 00:27:19.408]  And they think you're stupid.
[00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:22.591]  And that's what it comes down to.
[00:27:23.112 --> 00:27:27.576]  They raise money off me with fundraising ads all over the internet and all over everywhere.
[00:27:28.397 --> 00:27:30.880]  They make themselves pertinent by, we're victims of Alex Jones!
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.322]  No one even knows Adam Lanza's name that killed the kids.
[00:27:33.342 --> 00:27:34.603]  It's all about me.
[00:27:34.763 --> 00:27:37.066]  And instead of sitting here and taking it anymore,
[00:27:37.486 --> 00:27:38.787]  I'm gonna start exposing these people.
[00:27:39.147 --> 00:27:40.468]  So you thought I was exposing you before?
[00:27:40.488 --> 00:27:41.228]  I never did anything to you.
[00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:42.349]  You did stuff to me.
[00:27:42.889 --> 00:27:43.770]  I'm a victim of you.
[00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:49.313]  So there's the Infowars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:27:49.474 --> 00:27:56.838]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's saw palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[00:27:57.258 --> 00:27:59.760]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those harmful
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.281]  I don't care what the globalists say about trying to protect Trump.
[00:28:02.461 --> 00:28:04.161]  They gotta kill Trump, that's the key.
[00:28:04.181 --> 00:28:06.742]  They gotta kill Pop, that's the key to quote the Godfather.
[00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:24.251]  All right, let me recap what's coming up.
[00:28:24.271 --> 00:28:30.195]  I'm going to drill into this huge statement Trump made, and some of his other amazing statements the last two days, and speeches.
[00:28:30.756 --> 00:28:32.357]  Massive election interference by Google.
[00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:33.318]  We're going to get more into that.
[00:28:33.758 --> 00:28:40.503]  FBI confirms Donald Trump was struck by a bullet during July 13th assassination attempt, despite all these claims that it wasn't happening.
[00:28:40.523 --> 00:28:41.504]  I don't need the FBI to tell me.
[00:28:41.524 --> 00:28:43.826]  You can see the damn bullet in the high-speed video.
[00:28:45.424 --> 00:28:49.247]  Thomas Matthews Crook spotted 90 minutes before Trump assassination attempt.
[00:28:49.707 --> 00:29:01.577]  SWAT team reports now leaked to Fox News and it's all been confirmed that they were telling the Secret Service he had rangefinders, appeared to be casing everything, that he needed to be followed or stopped 90 minutes.
[00:29:02.758 --> 00:29:13.926]  Now remember, I said Saturday the day it happened on the 13th, two plus weeks ago, I said, this looks like total stand down and we know for two minutes people are saying he's on the roof, he's got a gun.
[00:29:14.827 --> 00:29:21.909]  Then it turned out to be 7 minutes and 26 minutes, and now 90 minutes.
[00:29:22.089 --> 00:29:24.129]  We've got that incredible information.
[00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:28.370]  Also, Biden's coming to Austin, Texas tonight.
[00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:29.531]  He lands at 2.30.
[00:29:29.571 --> 00:29:31.431]  They're going to shut down large parts of the city.
[00:29:32.051 --> 00:29:35.092]  And he's set to make his announcement of packing the Supreme Court.
[00:29:36.104 --> 00:29:37.926]  And a bunch of other nightmare operations.
[00:29:37.966 --> 00:29:39.148]  We've got that.
[00:29:39.628 --> 00:29:41.370]  And there's a lot of conservatives saying, yay!
[00:29:41.771 --> 00:29:43.733]  He may be removed via the 25th Amendment.
[00:29:44.274 --> 00:29:47.377]  Republicans are moving forward to do that because the Democrats already secretly...
[00:29:48.151 --> 00:29:49.652]  Threatened him with the 25th.
[00:29:49.972 --> 00:29:51.552]  So they're saying if he isn't coming, he's gotta go.
[00:29:51.672 --> 00:29:52.393]  You don't want that.
[00:29:53.013 --> 00:29:54.813]  That will make Kamala be the president.
[00:29:54.833 --> 00:29:55.934]  It'll make her look legitimate.
[00:29:56.634 --> 00:30:00.436]  And again, she's gonna lose, but they need you to believe that she could win.
[00:30:00.996 --> 00:30:03.497]  They know that no one would believe Biden could steal it for a second time.
[00:30:03.917 --> 00:30:06.918]  Kamala's being put in so they can try to steal it and to make it believable.
[00:30:06.978 --> 00:30:07.678]  But here's the key.
[00:30:08.659 --> 00:30:09.279]  The key.
[00:30:10.639 --> 00:30:12.160]  I mean, key, key, key, key, key.
[00:30:13.817 --> 00:30:29.429]  They wouldn't have tried to kill Trump on the 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania if they didn't know the landslide's so big they're going to have massive problems stealing it because it's too big to rig because they've only got so many dead people and people who moved out of district in Zuckerberg's 450-something million database.
[00:30:30.009 --> 00:30:30.410]  Remember that?
[00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:35.693]  So they are in absolute full panic mode on that front.
[00:30:36.394 --> 00:30:39.676]  The CIA denies Trump's shooter was subject of MKUltra.
[00:30:40.877 --> 00:30:41.438]  So it wasn't like
[00:30:43.168 --> 00:30:45.410]  Theodore Kaczynski, who was CIA, admittedly.
[00:30:46.431 --> 00:30:46.731]  Look it up.
[00:30:47.292 --> 00:30:50.695]  It wasn't like he was CIA-connected like Lee Harvey Oswald or...
[00:30:52.642 --> 00:30:54.863]  Tim McVeigh or Sirhan Sirhan.
[00:30:54.923 --> 00:30:55.583]  No, no, no, no.
[00:30:55.623 --> 00:30:57.723]  This time they weren't involved.
[00:30:57.863 --> 00:30:58.543]  And maybe they weren't.
[00:30:58.964 --> 00:31:01.144]  You know, the FBI is basically just as bad or worse.
[00:31:01.944 --> 00:31:04.265]  But they definitely, uh, the Globalists definitely stood down there.
[00:31:04.285 --> 00:31:04.965]  We'll be getting to all that.
[00:31:05.585 --> 00:31:07.386]  Also, you know, it happened on Friday.
[00:31:07.426 --> 00:31:09.306]  We covered it some of the special reports on Saturday.
[00:31:10.186 --> 00:31:12.847]  Chase did a great job last night covering it when he sat in for me.
[00:31:13.807 --> 00:31:18.588]  But the whole satanic ritual that got the attention is the Last Supper being blasphemed.
[00:31:19.189 --> 00:31:20.649]  There are a bunch of other rituals they did.
[00:31:22.193 --> 00:31:29.799]  That we're just as crazy, including a Died Suddenly video that I saw but forgot to send.
[00:31:29.819 --> 00:31:31.621]  We're gonna make sure we have it on the computer.
[00:31:31.641 --> 00:31:36.825]  They did a Died Suddenly Olympics ritual.
[00:31:36.845 --> 00:31:37.285]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:31:37.305 --> 00:31:37.766]  So we have it.
[00:31:38.166 --> 00:31:39.047]  That is coming up.
[00:31:39.067 --> 00:31:40.288]  Everybody dies of heart attacks.
[00:31:40.588 --> 00:31:47.074]  They love to tell you what they're going to do to you.
[00:31:48.456 --> 00:31:54.281]  Also, Kamala Harris would eliminate religious freedom, has extreme anti-Christian, anti-Catholic agenda.
[00:31:55.702 --> 00:31:59.164]  Ukraine group arrested for arson attacks in Poland and Baltic nations.
[00:31:59.445 --> 00:32:02.367]  They've been blaming on Russians, but still NATO blames the Russians.
[00:32:02.447 --> 00:32:03.268]  False flags there.
[00:32:04.749 --> 00:32:07.151]  There is just so much we're going to be getting to.
[00:32:08.243 --> 00:32:12.085]  Here today, WHO, right on time with them doing emergency authorization here in the U.S.
[00:32:12.225 --> 00:32:14.367]  for the new mRNA bird flu vaccine.
[00:32:14.547 --> 00:32:16.488]  It's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy.
[00:32:16.988 --> 00:32:18.989]  Pushes new mRNA bird flu vaccines.
[00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:24.713]  And this with the Pentagon openly saying, okay, looks like the shots are killing people.
[00:32:26.674 --> 00:32:27.935]  That's all coming up today.
[00:32:28.035 --> 00:32:34.519]  But first, let's get into some of the Trump's latest statements at different speeches he gave in Nashville, Tennessee, and also
[00:32:35.726 --> 00:32:41.070]  Up in town in Minnesota to roarous applause and support.
[00:32:41.571 --> 00:32:44.133]  These things have just gone from exciting to electric.
[00:32:44.874 --> 00:32:52.460]  Here is President Trump in Minnesota saying Kamala and the Democrats want to ban your cows.
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:53.400]  Are we doing it in Europe?
[00:32:53.801 --> 00:32:54.922]  They plan to try to do it here.
[00:32:54.942 --> 00:32:55.802]  It's happening in Canada.
[00:32:55.822 --> 00:32:57.644]  It's all part of the WUF agenda.
[00:32:58.725 --> 00:33:00.406]  But they really want to get rid of people.
[00:33:03.843 --> 00:33:04.644]  Is what we're made of.
[00:33:04.704 --> 00:33:07.525]  So we are the carbon they want to reduce.
[00:33:07.565 --> 00:33:10.147]  I can show you Bill Gates saying cut down trees, they're bad too.
[00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:18.932]  So, they're listing cows as super pollutants.
[00:33:20.513 --> 00:33:23.015]  So here's President Trump hitting on all cylinders.
[00:33:24.156 --> 00:33:27.438]  And now we have somebody that's, I believe, worse than him.
[00:33:27.658 --> 00:33:28.198]  I really do.
[00:33:28.258 --> 00:33:32.741]  Kamala called for slashing consumption of red meat to fight
[00:33:33.866 --> 00:33:34.707]  Climate change.
[00:33:38.609 --> 00:33:39.730]  Now you know what that means?
[00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:44.092]  Because in a couple of countries they're actually getting rid of their cows and their cattle.
[00:33:44.733 --> 00:33:46.234]  They want to get rid of their cattle!
[00:33:47.154 --> 00:33:50.156]  Because they say it's environmentally unacceptable.
[00:33:50.336 --> 00:33:51.157]  So that'll be next.
[00:33:51.177 --> 00:33:52.697]  They're going to be coming to Utah.
[00:33:53.278 --> 00:33:56.720]  Please go to the legislature and get rid of all cows, all cattle.
[00:33:57.808 --> 00:33:59.509]  Horses will be next at some point.
[00:33:59.589 --> 00:34:01.909]  I guess they'll go after the human also.
[00:34:02.049 --> 00:34:02.690]  It's crazy.
[00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:03.950]  It's crazy.
[00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:05.330]  The humans are next.
[00:34:07.811 --> 00:34:09.912]  They were taking down Robert E. Lee statues six years ago.
[00:34:09.952 --> 00:34:12.733]  He said next it'll be George Washington, Thomas Jefferson.
[00:34:14.833 --> 00:34:18.995]  Hundreds of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington statues have been removed across the country.
[00:34:19.935 --> 00:34:26.557]  Last week in the big courthouse in Chicago, they were beginning to remove it and the mayor finally got cold feet and did.
[00:34:31.198 --> 00:34:33.120]  So yeah, it's very simple.
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.963]  They're saying cow farts are bad.
[00:34:37.923 --> 00:34:40.906]  Well, give me a second to explain this.
[00:34:41.606 --> 00:34:44.048]  You know what comes out of the end of your ass, right folks?
[00:34:48.031 --> 00:34:48.491]  That's right.
[00:34:48.692 --> 00:34:50.393]  Most of that gas is what?
[00:34:51.133 --> 00:34:51.594]  What is it?
[00:34:52.474 --> 00:34:53.355]  Methane!
[00:34:54.896 --> 00:34:57.999]  So if a cow's farts are bad, yours are bad too.
[00:35:00.796 --> 00:35:10.200]  And again, there were more buffalo, you can look this up, three times more in North America 200 years ago, it's estimated, than there are cows today.
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.621]  Same animal, can breed it with a buffalo.
[00:35:15.722 --> 00:35:18.903]  Cows are all over the world, except Antarctica.
[00:35:21.885 --> 00:35:22.405]  They're everywhere.
[00:35:23.945 --> 00:35:24.805]  And they're good.
[00:35:25.385 --> 00:35:26.246]  And they're not bad.
[00:35:26.386 --> 00:35:29.026]  And methane helps hold the atmosphere into the Earth.
[00:35:29.627 --> 00:35:30.867]  So we don't lose our atmosphere.
[00:35:31.687 --> 00:35:38.009]  All the scientists that actually study astrophysics and how it works understand that.
[00:35:38.149 --> 00:35:39.689]  So, cows have always been here.
[00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:41.350]  They're not bad.
[00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:43.390]  They're good.
[00:35:45.291 --> 00:35:46.171]  It's all a fraud.
[00:35:47.151 --> 00:35:50.532]  But they want total control over everything.
[00:35:50.552 --> 00:35:51.392]  Such an amazing clip.
[00:35:52.113 --> 00:35:53.113]  Now, let's play Trump.
[00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:58.594]  On Bitcoin and central bank digital currencies.
[00:35:58.654 --> 00:36:01.257]  I have several clips on that.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:13.750]  And then we're going to... Clip 17 from MSNBC.
[00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:15.312]  Here are those clips.
[00:36:16.806 --> 00:36:23.311]  But for too long, our government has violated the cardinal rule that every Bitcoiner knows by heart.
[00:36:23.812 --> 00:36:26.014]  Never sell your Bitcoin, right?
[00:36:31.498 --> 00:36:32.719]  That's right, isn't it, huh?
[00:36:32.999 --> 00:36:33.540]  That's right.
[00:36:35.561 --> 00:36:36.702]  How did I figure that one?
[00:36:37.583 --> 00:36:39.745]  Never sell your Bitcoin, and so...
[00:36:40.845 --> 00:36:54.954]  As the final part of my plan today, I am announcing that if I am elected, it will be the policy of my administration, United States of America, to keep 100% of all the Bitcoin the U.S.
[00:36:55.034 --> 00:36:58.636]  government currently holds or acquires into the future.
[00:36:58.696 --> 00:36:58.996]  We'll keep 100%.
[00:36:59.056 --> 00:36:59.817]  I hope you do well, please.
[00:37:03.663 --> 00:37:10.389]  This will serve, in effect, as the core of the strategic national Bitcoin stockpile.
[00:37:11.009 --> 00:37:21.698]  As you know... As you know, most of the Bitcoin currently held by the United States government was obtained through law enforcement action.
[00:37:21.718 --> 00:37:22.259]  You know that.
[00:37:22.319 --> 00:37:23.440]  They took it from you.
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.402]  Let's take that guy's life.
[00:37:26.462 --> 00:37:28.804]  Let's take his family, his house.
[00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:32.608]  Is Bitcoin, we'll turn it into Bitcoin.
[00:37:33.229 --> 00:37:36.310]  It's been taken away from you because that's where we're going now.
[00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:37.791]  That's where this country is going.
[00:37:37.811 --> 00:37:40.292]  It's a fascist regime.
[00:37:40.832 --> 00:37:48.016]  How many of you know a black man who has expressed to you that they're committed to voting for Donald Trump?
[00:37:51.115 --> 00:38:01.278]  For the brothers who have told you that, or said that to you, has the emergence of Kamala Harris changed that for those brothers?
[00:38:01.518 --> 00:38:01.718]  No.
[00:38:04.979 --> 00:38:08.820]  So, they asked a bunch of white ladies in Wisconsin, who are you gonna vote for?
[00:38:09.001 --> 00:38:09.301]  Trump.
[00:38:09.721 --> 00:38:11.101]  Asked black guys, who are you gonna vote for?
[00:38:11.361 --> 00:38:11.661]  Trump.
[00:38:12.942 --> 00:38:20.124]  But we're told Kamala, who's been having rallies that I posted on X over the weekend, with maybe 200 people at them,
[00:38:24.062 --> 00:38:35.914]  And we're to believe this lady, who's as black as I am, or as Native American as Pocahontas, Senator Warren, is really set to win.
[00:38:36.494 --> 00:38:37.916]  They know Trump's going to win a landslide.
[00:38:37.936 --> 00:38:38.937]  They need to be able to steal it.
[00:38:40.358 --> 00:38:43.801]  They want to be able to convince you that Kamala Harris can win.
[00:38:44.282 --> 00:38:45.443]  I thought we had these in the computer.
[00:38:45.483 --> 00:38:45.803]  We don't.
[00:38:45.823 --> 00:38:47.165]  They're pulling them in right now.
[00:38:49.352 --> 00:38:55.357]  Trump's fiery speech in Nashville on CBDC's central bank digital currencies are a threat to liberty.
[00:38:55.377 --> 00:38:55.937]  He's damn right.
[00:38:56.377 --> 00:38:58.079]  Ann Harris has a low IQ.
[00:38:58.799 --> 00:39:00.140]  We've got another clip we're going to play.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:06.325]  We'll play them back to back of him talking about Kamala being no Margaret Thatcher.
[00:39:06.345 --> 00:39:07.026]  And boy, do I agree.
[00:39:10.225 --> 00:39:20.649]  Next, I will immediately order the Treasury Department and other federal agencies to cease and desist all steps necessary, because, you know, there's a thing going on in your industry.
[00:39:20.689 --> 00:39:27.811]  They want to move the creation of a central bank digital currency.
[00:39:27.911 --> 00:39:28.511]  It's over.
[00:39:28.732 --> 00:39:29.272]  Forget it.
[00:39:31.332 --> 00:39:31.633]  Yes.
[00:39:32.533 --> 00:39:33.593]  CBDC.
[00:39:34.133 --> 00:39:38.155]  There will never be a CBDC while I'm President of the United States.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.264]  And I will always defend the right to self-custody.
[00:39:45.485 --> 00:39:46.086]  Self-custody.
[00:39:48.068 --> 00:39:49.569]  You're going to have a great industry.
[00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:57.177]  You're going to have a great industry and we're going to be fuel for your industry, not
[00:39:58.098 --> 00:39:59.559]  Demolish your industry.
[00:39:59.619 --> 00:40:08.807]  America will once again be a nation that protects property rights, privacy, freedom of transaction, freedom of association, and freedom of speech.
[00:40:08.847 --> 00:40:18.275]  We're gonna change our, we're gonna go back to the old days when we were a nation that was building, not a nation that was eating itself alive from within.
[00:40:19.236 --> 00:40:21.618]  Feeling, very smart people too.
[00:40:21.718 --> 00:40:23.159]  Congratulations on all
[00:40:24.082 --> 00:40:25.023]  That you've accomplished.
[00:40:25.043 --> 00:40:26.163]  This room is amazing.
[00:40:26.223 --> 00:40:28.845]  The people in this room, high-IQ individuals.
[00:40:28.905 --> 00:40:31.627]  I'm running against a low-IQ individual.
[00:40:31.707 --> 00:40:31.967]  Her.
[00:40:32.567 --> 00:40:33.988]  I'm not even talking about him.
[00:40:34.008 --> 00:40:34.349]  Her.
[00:40:34.409 --> 00:40:36.190]  I got a low-IQ individual.
[00:40:40.769 --> 00:40:50.855]  Over the past three and a half years, Bordasar Harris, which is what she called herself, even the New York Times today, they took an article out of the New York Times, Bordasar.
[00:40:51.195 --> 00:41:02.381]  Now, you know, they're deleting everything that says, these people back there are deleting everything, but we already have it.
[00:41:02.401 --> 00:41:03.662]  You know, three months ago,
[00:41:05.054 --> 00:41:07.596]  She was thought of so badly, they were just killing her.
[00:41:08.296 --> 00:41:13.280]  And now that she's in this position, they're trying to make her into a, let's say, Margaret Thatcher.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:14.901]  I don't think so.
[00:41:15.081 --> 00:41:16.102]  It's not gonna happen.
[00:41:17.483 --> 00:41:19.884]  Margaret Thatcher didn't laugh like that, did she?
[00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:20.465]  Did she, love?
[00:41:22.466 --> 00:41:24.507]  If she did, she wouldn't have been Margaret Thatcher.
[00:41:24.547 --> 00:41:25.468]  It's very simple, right?
[00:41:26.789 --> 00:41:32.473]  Bordasar Harris allowed almost 20 million illegal aliens to stampede into our country.
[00:41:33.786 --> 00:41:34.086]  Boom!
[00:41:34.146 --> 00:41:34.686]  Powerful!
[00:41:34.846 --> 00:41:39.167]  These are important clips and they're trying to censor Trump with their attempt Google to block his name.
[00:41:39.587 --> 00:41:40.287]  We couldn't even search it.
[00:41:40.307 --> 00:41:42.248]  It would just bring up Donald Duck for two days.
[00:41:42.788 --> 00:41:43.388]  Has blown up.
[00:41:43.428 --> 00:41:47.489]  He's now trending the top of everywhere as people want to hear what's being blocked.
[00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:52.790]  Look at that stadium completely packed in a small town in Minnesota.
[00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:57.991]  And of course a crowd even way bigger than that in Nashville for the Bitcoin event.
[00:41:59.191 --> 00:42:01.211]  Up to two events a day right now.
[00:42:02.092 --> 00:42:03.392]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:42:05.444 --> 00:42:33.155]  All right, I want to speak to the assassination now that happened back on the 13th, now the 29th, more than two weeks ago, and the propaganda that nobody was shot, and that Trump faked it, and that he had a fake bandage, he takes it off, and then they use blurry video to go, we don't see anything, and if you actually get the HD videos and blow it up, you see the streak through his cartilage that's gone.
[00:42:33.956 --> 00:42:34.757]  And it was a grace.
[00:42:35.497 --> 00:42:36.278]  They tried to kill him.
[00:42:36.858 --> 00:42:37.499]  That's the point.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:43.884]  Imagine if they would have missed completely, then they would have said, you know, the other people didn't even die or get injured.
[00:42:45.205 --> 00:42:46.966]  But you cannot fake something like this.
[00:42:47.867 --> 00:42:51.890]  And the HD slowdown video of the 556 bullet.
[00:42:53.011 --> 00:42:55.613]  By the grace of God, a few centimeters to
[00:42:59.986 --> 00:43:01.427]  I don't know.
[00:43:20.259 --> 00:43:34.182]  I didn't lie about WMDs in Iraq, I didn't kidnap kids with the Clintons out of Haiti, I didn't commit any of these leprous crimes, but I'm the worst guy on Earth for saying things I never said, but then they openly say the type of things they claim I said, and they're the good guys.
[00:43:36.442 --> 00:43:43.023]  But now after the firestorm with Ray saying, well, he might have been hit by a bullet, maybe shrapnel, he's on the podium out front where the bullets are coming from.
[00:43:43.323 --> 00:43:45.584]  You don't get shrapnel before a bullet hits something.
[00:43:46.718 --> 00:43:52.540]  And the shrapnel shoots out in a 360 degrees above and below, not back towards the president.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:56.821]  And I've had top world snipers on concurring with my layman's view of that.
[00:43:57.121 --> 00:43:58.521]  They say, abso-fricking-lutely.
[00:44:00.062 --> 00:44:05.603]  Maybe if a bullet shot back and hit metal a foot behind him, it would splatter back and maybe do something, but it dissipates very quickly.
[00:44:05.864 --> 00:44:10.965]  But not 50, 60 feet behind, hitting a bleacher, and then shoots back and nicks his ear.
[00:44:11.025 --> 00:44:14.026]  No, it went right by his ear.
[00:44:15.834 --> 00:44:24.860]  And again, the ear is cartilage, and so it bleeds a lot at first, and it seals itself, and an open wound and cartilage is the color, basically white.
[00:44:27.161 --> 00:44:30.123]  And then Trump does put the bronzer on.
[00:44:31.964 --> 00:44:34.625]  So, basically makeup, and it's bronzer over it.
[00:44:35.226 --> 00:44:37.787]  That's why you just see the slit in his ear.
[00:44:38.488 --> 00:44:40.909]  And I'll show you some of those photos, and we'll do the HD of these.
[00:44:41.029 --> 00:44:41.750]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:44:43.357 --> 00:44:48.820]  FBI confirms Donald Trump was struck by a bullet during the July 13th assassination attempt.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:56.625]  Again, I was shot when I was nine years old by a .22 caliber pellet gun in the ear and actually pierced right through it.
[00:44:56.645 --> 00:45:01.107]  Didn't graze me, went right through the back, blew a hole, and in days, perfectly sealed.
[00:45:02.048 --> 00:45:03.509]  I was always amazed by that.
[00:45:03.549 --> 00:45:07.691]  For a few years, I had a little purple spot on the back, and over time, that went away as well.
[00:45:09.552 --> 00:45:09.852]  And again,
[00:45:11.388 --> 00:45:13.049]  I didn't tell my dad I was going to do this.
[00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:14.591]  People, it just sounds unbelievable.
[00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:15.932]  People haven't been around guns a lot.
[00:45:15.952 --> 00:45:16.773]  They don't know about this stuff.
[00:45:16.813 --> 00:45:23.118]  But the point is, I could call my dad right now because he pulled up to get me at the ranch with my friend I brought with me that was an idiot and shot me.
[00:45:24.279 --> 00:45:26.921]  And he was the witness to this with my mom.
[00:45:27.902 --> 00:45:30.924]  But see what I randomly, I tried to call him earlier.
[00:45:30.985 --> 00:45:32.166]  He hates going on air.
[00:45:32.966 --> 00:45:33.707]  I'm going to tell him we're on air.
[00:45:33.727 --> 00:45:34.628]  Let me see if my dad answers.
[00:45:35.677 --> 00:45:36.917]  I called him earlier, he didn't answer.
[00:45:36.957 --> 00:45:38.658]  I was going to try to see if he'd come on the show and talk about it.
[00:45:38.678 --> 00:45:40.439]  Because, you know, it does sound ridiculous.
[00:45:40.519 --> 00:45:43.340]  Oh, I got shot in the ear like Trump, too, by a .22 caliber pellet gun.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.380]  Let's see if he answers.
[00:45:47.281 --> 00:45:47.781]  Something else.
[00:45:47.801 --> 00:45:48.341]  There we go.
[00:45:48.361 --> 00:45:51.222]  Let's see if he answers.
[00:45:55.524 --> 00:45:57.004]  I called him twice for the show, he didn't answer.
[00:45:59.545 --> 00:46:01.606]  He's got hearing aids, though, so those are not plugged into the phone.
[00:46:07.068 --> 00:46:08.809]  I'm getting really irritated by this now.
[00:46:08.849 --> 00:46:09.409]  Call him again!
[00:46:10.949 --> 00:46:11.249]  Answer!
[00:46:11.369 --> 00:46:12.270]  He usually answers.
[00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:13.950]  I don't know what he's up to.
[00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:15.971]  I haven't seen him in a couple weeks.
[00:46:19.212 --> 00:46:20.172]  I'll get him to tell the story.
[00:46:20.953 --> 00:46:24.094]  Because, I mean, none of this stuff, you know, the left are just pure idiots.
[00:46:25.434 --> 00:46:26.575]  And this is important.
[00:46:29.476 --> 00:46:31.176]  You know, let's say a pellet gun, I forget.
[00:46:31.236 --> 00:46:35.938]  Guys, look up what a .22 caliber high-powered, it was a high-powered one, pellet gun,
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.282]  Goes at, what, 400, 500 feet a second, I'm guessing?
[00:46:40.843 --> 00:46:42.584]  And then a 5.56 comes out at 3,000 feet.
[00:46:42.744 --> 00:46:47.688]  A BB gun, wow, 1,000 feet per second, didn't know that.
[00:46:50.009 --> 00:46:50.230]  Wow.
[00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:51.811]  Point is, it went right through my ear.
[00:46:52.471 --> 00:46:55.813]  And a lot of blood, and then just stopped, and then just sealed up, and it was just, it was nothing.
[00:46:55.833 --> 00:46:57.054]  I was like, wow, that's crazy.
[00:46:57.074 --> 00:46:58.455]  It didn't leave, like, a piercing, either.
[00:46:58.495 --> 00:47:02.638]  Like, the cartilage just, uh, you know, just, just, just sealed back up.
[00:47:03.639 --> 00:47:04.139]  Well, it didn't matter.
[00:47:04.339 --> 00:47:04.780]  It's a true story.
[00:47:05.987 --> 00:47:08.188]  But, uh, continuing here.
[00:47:08.348 --> 00:47:09.929]  And again, I want you guys to show the HDs of these.
[00:47:09.969 --> 00:47:10.569]  I sent you to these.
[00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:16.071]  FBI confirms Donald Trump was struck by a bullet during July 13th assassination attempt.
[00:47:18.672 --> 00:47:22.874]  And, uh, here are folks showing the AP, you know, photo blow-ups of him in recent interviews.
[00:47:22.894 --> 00:47:30.477]  You see the groove out of the cartilage, where it's just a little bit darker, because that's because cartilage, again, is
[00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:32.762]  We're good to go.
[00:47:52.267 --> 00:47:59.650]  If you hit maybe a millimeter in here towards the middle, and it got enough pressure hitting bone, and the bone exploded, then it would blow the ear off.
[00:48:00.071 --> 00:48:03.752]  But if it nicks, I can't tell you how many times I've been shooting a cactus, you know, as a target.
[00:48:04.112 --> 00:48:10.135]  You drive out in the countryside, and there's a cactus 500 yards away, and it's about, you know, it's a prickly pear.
[00:48:10.195 --> 00:48:12.536]  It's about, you know, the one prickly pear piece you're shooting.
[00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:14.717]  It's about 10 inches tall, about 6 inches wide.
[00:48:15.698 --> 00:48:16.698]  You want to use it as a target.
[00:48:16.718 --> 00:48:19.820]  I'll even get a black marker out.
[00:48:20.888 --> 00:48:34.139]  A sharpie, and I'll put a black dot right in the middle, and then you start shooting at it while you're sighting the gun in, and the gun isn't perfectly sighted in, you haven't shot in a few years, it was banging around the back of the pickup truck, and it nicks the top of the prickly pear.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:43.127]  And you drive up and look at it, use a spotting scope, and you see this little perfect nick through the top, the little cut on the top, that's exactly the same thing.
[00:48:43.347 --> 00:48:44.968]  And I would say prickly pear is kind of like cartilage.
[00:48:45.609 --> 00:48:47.490]  It's like plant cartilage, it's tough, it's fibrous.
[00:48:48.668 --> 00:48:50.909]  It's very similar to that.
[00:48:51.329 --> 00:48:54.690]  A little juice comes out of it, but in an hour, you can't really see it because it just seals up.
[00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:56.111]  It's the same thing.
[00:48:56.231 --> 00:49:00.392]  And you keep shooting, and then, you know, after you dial the scope in, you're hitting right in the bullseye.
[00:49:00.812 --> 00:49:01.713]  You draw on the prickly pear.
[00:49:01.733 --> 00:49:04.553]  A little secret I have to buy any targets is use prickly pears.
[00:49:05.334 --> 00:49:10.415]  Sometimes I'll use, you know, if it's that time of the season, the spring or summer, prickly pear fruits.
[00:49:11.616 --> 00:49:14.497]  You can use that as your bullseye and try to blow those off.
[00:49:15.599 --> 00:49:18.062]  But that's just a little inside baseball there on that front.
[00:49:18.122 --> 00:49:19.123]  So, here it is.
[00:49:19.763 --> 00:49:27.551]  And then, right here, is the left showing it with his hair over the part that got nicked, and saying, where's the bullet wound?
[00:49:29.673 --> 00:49:30.914]  Well, the bullet wound's right here.
[00:49:30.954 --> 00:49:38.121]  You can see where the ear is concave, where the bullet sped right past him and nicked his ear.
[00:49:38.161 --> 00:49:39.742]  They don't understand being nicked.
[00:49:42.526 --> 00:49:56.993]  The left's also showing these, where his hair is combed over the ear, and you can clearly still see the nick right here, but they're trying to claim that that did not happen.
[00:49:58.434 --> 00:50:04.817]  All right, I'm gonna go to break, and I'm gonna come back and get into Biden coming to Austin and why that's important.
[00:50:07.011 --> 00:50:13.833]  It's not really important, except he's going to announce the attack on the Supreme Court and a bunch of other garbage, so it is important.
[00:50:15.434 --> 00:50:19.075]  And how most Americans, including conservatives, want him to step down.
[00:50:19.135 --> 00:50:20.256]  We do not want him to step down.
[00:50:20.296 --> 00:50:28.699]  That will elevate Kamala Harris to, quote, the presidency, where she'll have presidential powers in the next 98 days that we have left in the election.
[00:50:30.217 --> 00:50:30.917]  Let's put it on screen.
[00:50:30.997 --> 00:50:31.737]  It's 98 days, right?
[00:50:31.757 --> 00:50:32.458]  And then how many days?
[00:50:32.778 --> 00:50:34.558]  You add 79 on to that to the inauguration.
[00:50:35.078 --> 00:50:41.279]  That's how much time that idiot and her controllers will have power to do whatever they want, and she'll be elevated to this presidential level.
[00:50:41.319 --> 00:50:42.140]  We do not want that.
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:44.080]  So I'll be talking about that.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:45.980]  Also the incredible stand-down.
[00:50:46.881 --> 00:50:47.781]  Now 90 minutes?
[00:50:49.021 --> 00:50:51.181]  That's 174 days to the inauguration.
[00:50:51.341 --> 00:50:52.862]  And then how many days to the election?
[00:50:52.882 --> 00:50:52.862]  98.
[00:50:52.902 --> 00:50:53.722]  So my memory's served.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:56.261]  So there we go.
[00:50:56.281 --> 00:50:57.162]  All right, I'm going to break.
[00:50:57.502 --> 00:50:59.785]  Please remember, I cannot do this without you.
[00:50:59.805 --> 00:51:03.909]  So if you like what we're doing and you like fighting back against tyranny, you don't want to roll over and be their slave.
[00:51:04.149 --> 00:51:05.491]  It's real simple.
[00:51:06.192 --> 00:51:07.273]  Support the broadcast.
[00:51:07.293 --> 00:51:09.115]  And I thank those that have and I encourage those that haven't.
[00:51:09.135 --> 00:51:09.675]  What are you thinking?
[00:51:10.256 --> 00:51:11.317]  We have amazing products.
[00:51:11.357 --> 00:51:15.141]  I mean, Nitric Boost, top scientists, you know, like
[00:51:16.002 --> 00:51:24.729]  Judy Minkovic, Dr. Minkovic just said this is the best formula out there with all the natural compounds to clean out your blood, open up your arteries and veins, and counter all the garbage that's going on out there.
[00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:34.237]  You need Nitric Boost, and there's the big Same Info Wars mega sale, 40% off on Nitric Boost, 40% off on DNA Force Plus, 40% off on Brain Force Ultra.
[00:51:35.017 --> 00:51:38.580]  Basel Beats does a similar thing, it's a different formula, as Nitric Boost.
[00:51:39.121 --> 00:51:39.961]  It's all there.
[00:51:40.662 --> 00:51:41.222]  The Ultra
[00:51:42.403 --> 00:51:43.604]  12.
[00:51:42.463 --> 00:51:43.604]  Highest quality B12.
[00:51:43.684 --> 00:51:45.465]  The Survival Shield X3.
[00:51:45.485 --> 00:51:46.986]  The Survival Shield X2.
[00:51:47.687 --> 00:51:50.088]  It's all there at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:51:50.108 --> 00:51:51.149]  The highest quality fish oil.
[00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.970]  And it keeps us on the air.
[00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:54.491]  So please take action now.
[00:51:54.932 --> 00:51:58.354]  I thank you for your support at InfoWarsStore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:51:58.374 --> 00:51:59.815]  And while you're there, now shipping out,
[00:52:06.667 --> 00:52:12.050]  The Trump bulletproof shirt with the iconic image of him after he got shot.
[00:52:13.051 --> 00:52:14.412]  All at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:52:14.432 --> 00:52:15.232]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:52:15.252 --> 00:52:17.094]  Stay with us.
[00:52:17.114 --> 00:52:22.277]  This is a make it or break it moment, so I need people to connect those synapses in their brain for you to make a decision.
[00:52:23.438 --> 00:52:26.560]  If you don't support InfoWars, we will be shut down.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.381]  People say, well, they're constantly trying to shut you down.
[00:52:29.441 --> 00:52:30.162]  How are you still in the air?
[00:52:30.322 --> 00:52:30.602]  God.
[00:52:31.643 --> 00:52:32.703]  But God works through people.
[00:52:34.224 --> 00:52:34.425]  So...
[00:52:35.509 --> 00:52:39.530]  We're in a paradox here where the judge says we're open for three more months.
[00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:45.671]  If we're able to get a buyer out of the law, they won't be able to shut us down.
[00:52:45.691 --> 00:52:46.631]  I'll just work with somebody else.
[00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:48.032]  And that's coming.
[00:52:48.052 --> 00:52:48.752]  That's got to be set up.
[00:52:49.932 --> 00:52:59.114]  But in the meantime, if people believe the news that we're being shut down everywhere, which they tried to do and failed, by that foregone conclusion, we're shut down.
[00:52:59.254 --> 00:52:59.614]  And under
[00:53:01.152 --> 00:53:10.597]  The last federal bankruptcy manager who would not reorder product and killed all our advertising, who was positioning us to be shut down and tried to shut us down, we caught him.
[00:53:10.837 --> 00:53:11.897]  The judge caught him and fired him.
[00:53:13.378 --> 00:53:14.839]  We're almost sold out of all the products.
[00:53:15.663 --> 00:53:15.923]  All right.
[00:53:16.723 --> 00:53:19.464]  But we have a lot of great products that are still in stock.
[00:53:19.944 --> 00:53:20.684]  Limited supplies.
[00:53:20.744 --> 00:53:24.005]  So I need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:53:24.225 --> 00:53:25.286]  And we just had a donation button.
[00:53:25.306 --> 00:53:26.066]  Maybe we should just do that.
[00:53:26.806 --> 00:53:29.567]  You're fighting for freedom in a key election, battling the globalists.
[00:53:29.587 --> 00:53:30.227]  We need support.
[00:53:30.967 --> 00:53:32.548]  But we want a long-term relationship with you.
[00:53:32.568 --> 00:53:34.508]  We want to be symbiotic.
[00:53:34.528 --> 00:53:42.031]  We want you to get great products you like and deliver to you quickly and enjoy them and have them empower you and make your life better so you love them and you keep getting them.
[00:53:42.051 --> 00:53:42.991]  We want a relationship.
[00:53:43.937 --> 00:53:49.682]  So, there's the Infowars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:53:50.424 --> 00:53:57.689]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's saw palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[00:53:57.729 --> 00:54:02.133]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[00:54:02.153 --> 00:54:03.474]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[00:54:03.494 --> 00:54:14.822]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWarsMD.
[00:54:15.263 --> 00:54:16.744]  We've got ashwagandha gummy.
[00:54:17.384 --> 00:54:20.686]  Relaxes you, makes you feel really relaxed with no downer feeling.
[00:54:21.547 --> 00:54:21.967]  Amazing.
[00:54:22.788 --> 00:54:23.628]  An incredible product.
[00:54:24.709 --> 00:54:25.549]  Goodnight Sleep.
[00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:27.050]  We have a lot of great sleep aids.
[00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:27.751]  This one's excellent.
[00:54:27.771 --> 00:54:28.911]  They're all different formulas.
[00:54:29.132 --> 00:54:29.652]  People love it.
[00:54:29.812 --> 00:54:30.592]  Goodnight Sleep.
[00:54:31.273 --> 00:54:32.194]  InfoWars MD.
[00:54:34.195 --> 00:54:38.998]  Ashwagandha with black pepper, which relaxes you and makes you lose weight.
[00:54:39.758 --> 00:54:40.698]  These are all concentrates.
[00:54:41.118 --> 00:54:42.039]  Joint Relief Max.
[00:54:42.219 --> 00:54:43.039]  Works really well.
[00:54:43.519 --> 00:54:44.379]  Great pain relief.
[00:54:44.539 --> 00:54:45.400]  Huge bottle of it.
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:46.340]  Jam-packed.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:47.340]  It's there.
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:48.801]  Joint Relief Max.
[00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:50.241]  InfoWars MD.
[00:54:50.601 --> 00:54:51.401]  Prostate support.
[00:54:51.441 --> 00:54:52.121]  Already mentioned that.
[00:54:52.762 --> 00:54:54.042]  This is just a top formula.
[00:54:54.062 --> 00:54:54.862]  Super high quality.
[00:54:55.242 --> 00:54:55.642]  Organic.
[00:54:56.223 --> 00:54:57.083]  Nerve Renew.
[00:54:57.763 --> 00:54:58.204]  Amazing.
[00:54:58.504 --> 00:55:00.987]  To get your nerves, not to kill pain, but to get your nerves healthy.
[00:55:01.167 --> 00:55:01.888]  Nitric Boost.
[00:55:02.068 --> 00:55:03.470]  Vitamin Refusion about to sell out.
[00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:04.331]  About to sell out.
[00:55:04.391 --> 00:55:05.252]  Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:55:05.432 --> 00:55:07.614]  And something I never talk about and should talk about more.
[00:55:07.714 --> 00:55:08.956]  Probiotic Fiber.
[00:55:09.116 --> 00:55:13.080]  A super high end product at a low price at infowarstore.com.
[00:55:13.141 --> 00:55:14.082]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:52.854]  There's a little Lincoln back on there, just talking to his cat, Nugent.
[00:55:56.955 --> 00:56:01.656]  Boy, he's on fire.
[00:56:03.707 --> 00:56:04.747]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:56:05.167 --> 00:56:08.088]  We're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:56:08.108 --> 00:56:08.368]  to 3 p.m.
[00:56:08.428 --> 00:56:08.868]  Central.
[00:56:09.348 --> 00:56:11.609]  I return Sunday nights 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:56:11.629 --> 00:56:15.229]  and do so many other live shows because we're in the fight of our lives.
[00:56:16.930 --> 00:56:18.210]  Now she's moving through.
[00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:23.551]  She keeps a motor clean.
[00:56:23.911 --> 00:56:24.951]  She's a number 13.
[00:56:33.598 --> 00:56:36.843]  Yeah, the number 13's unlucky for the New World Order.
[00:56:36.883 --> 00:56:37.584]  Lucky for us.
[00:56:39.087 --> 00:56:41.110]  Original 13 stars, 13 colonies.
[00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:43.614]  And then you turn on the power.
[00:56:51.405 --> 00:56:54.386]  Yes, man was given dominion over the earth until he signed it over to Satan.
[00:56:54.406 --> 00:57:00.467]  And we're now in the process of taking the deed back through Jesus Christ.
[00:57:00.527 --> 00:57:05.227]  But we have to execute in Christ's name to enforce the document.
[00:57:08.408 --> 00:57:14.169]  That's why the devil runs around like a chicken with his head cut off, because he knows his time is short.
[00:57:15.649 --> 00:57:17.269]  All right, let's fire up the phone system.
[00:57:17.289 --> 00:57:19.910]  Let's get somebody in there to take the calls.
[00:57:21.906 --> 00:57:23.788]  Twerk computer system, so you flip it on.
[00:57:23.808 --> 00:57:27.410]  It's not like, you know, classical phone system with flashing lights.
[00:57:28.391 --> 00:57:33.455]  And you're welcome to call in about Trump saying the new world order wants to depopulate the earth.
[00:57:33.475 --> 00:57:34.376]  You're like, well, we already know that.
[00:57:34.396 --> 00:57:35.757]  But yeah, that's a big deal for him to say that.
[00:57:37.499 --> 00:57:38.700]  We're getting this all out in the open.
[00:57:40.801 --> 00:57:44.024]  The globals have been on record wanting to do this for 50 years or more.
[00:57:45.645 --> 00:57:48.167]  But when you talk about it, they've attacked you.
[00:57:48.187 --> 00:57:48.548]  Well, now,
[00:57:50.799 --> 00:57:52.480]  It's good to have corporate media attack you.
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:53.900]  They're a joke.
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:58.242]  So everybody should stop being intimidated by what CNN attacks.
[00:57:58.442 --> 00:58:01.143]  Oh, CNN's attacking Donald Trump.
[00:58:01.163 --> 00:58:02.303]  Come on, Alex Jones' show.
[00:58:05.364 --> 00:58:06.605]  We better not have Donald Trump come on.
[00:58:06.805 --> 00:58:12.867]  And by the way, I got a call a month ago by the Bitcoin organizers, the big Bitcoin conference, the biggest in the world in Nashville.
[00:58:14.087 --> 00:58:16.828]  And they said, we want to fly you out here on the 27th or whatever.
[00:58:20.472 --> 00:58:21.733]  And we want you to introduce Trump.
[00:58:23.114 --> 00:58:24.114]  And I'm so busy.
[00:58:24.174 --> 00:58:24.995]  I'm not name-dropping.
[00:58:25.015 --> 00:58:25.695]  I'm so busy.
[00:58:25.756 --> 00:58:26.696]  I feel terrible about it.
[00:58:27.076 --> 00:58:28.597]  They wanted me and Luke Hradowski to introduce him.
[00:58:30.999 --> 00:58:33.821]  I was so busy, I kind of shelved it, and I thought, oh, the Trump campaign.
[00:58:33.841 --> 00:58:34.501]  Do they know about this?
[00:58:34.521 --> 00:58:34.982]  Yeah, they know.
[00:58:35.762 --> 00:58:37.383]  And it's not even that I'm jaded.
[00:58:37.563 --> 00:58:45.789]  I'm just so thinking about, like, how I like... It's not that I'm scared to be in public, but I kind of like being behind the scenes, and just, you know, it's effective.
[00:58:46.906 --> 00:58:48.687]  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, I'll get back with you, sure.
[00:58:48.707 --> 00:58:54.068]  Cause I didn't, I figured they'd do that and the campaign would hear about it and then it would become some fiasco.
[00:58:54.689 --> 00:58:56.189]  So I never, I never called him back.
[00:58:57.229 --> 00:58:59.450]  And then Luke's like, well, I'm speaking right before Trump.
[00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:00.270]  Too bad you didn't come.
[00:59:01.931 --> 00:59:04.312]  Like I spoke right before JD Vance in Detroit.
[00:59:04.872 --> 00:59:08.713]  And again, it's not that I'm, it's like, I'm so not trying to get in Mar-a-Lago.
[00:59:09.193 --> 00:59:12.154]  I'm so not trying to, Trump used to invite me to the White House all the time I never came.
[00:59:12.434 --> 00:59:13.235]  I probably should have gone.
[00:59:13.715 --> 00:59:14.355]  There's just this,
[00:59:15.626 --> 00:59:18.887]  Was it Groucho Marx or who was it that said I wouldn't join any club that would have me?
[00:59:19.247 --> 00:59:25.750]  It's not that I don't want to be in the Trump Club, it's just that... Here I get to talk to whoever wants to tune in, millions of people.
[00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:33.553]  My God, I mean, I'm so blessed that Elon Musk took over X. We're considerably reaching, let's not exaggerate, because it gets fed on our channel and I can't even track it everywhere.
[00:59:33.573 --> 00:59:35.634]  30 million people a day.
[00:59:37.595 --> 00:59:37.935]  Extra.
[00:59:39.636 --> 00:59:42.037]  And so I'm kind of like, yeah, I'll just stay here.
[00:59:43.012 --> 00:59:51.459]  And then I see that badass speech and I'm like, I was like, Aaron Russo asked me to be in his film, his big seminal film on the New World Order.
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.000]  What was the name of that?
[00:59:54.962 --> 00:59:56.163]  America, Freedom to Fascism.
[00:59:56.903 --> 01:00:00.406]  And I just was busy and said, I didn't, I didn't do it.
[01:00:00.667 --> 01:00:01.427]  And then it was a big hit.
[01:00:01.447 --> 01:00:02.548]  And I loved Aaron Russo already.
[01:00:02.968 --> 01:00:03.829]  Why did I not do that?
[01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:05.310]  Well, it's the same thing.
[01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:07.052]  I didn't introduce Trump and Bitcoin, my fault.
[01:00:08.792 --> 01:00:09.112]  Whatever.
[01:00:09.993 --> 01:00:10.574]  We'll be right back.
[01:00:10.594 --> 01:00:10.954]  Stay with us.
[01:00:11.534 --> 01:00:16.519]  A lot of stations don't carry the first five minutes, so you missed what I was saying, but I need to put a bookend on that.
[01:00:16.539 --> 01:00:17.820]  I didn't finish what I was talking about.
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:22.323]  I didn't tell the story of being invited by the biggest Bitcoin conference in the world.
[01:00:22.343 --> 01:00:24.405]  It was held in Nashville Saturday.
[01:00:24.425 --> 01:00:35.895]  I didn't tell the story of how they invited me to be the speaker before Trump, and I just never did it, and didn't call him back, and then it went forward, and Luke Rodowski was the speaker before him.
[01:00:37.236 --> 01:00:40.237]  And because they wanted me and Luke to be there, the speakers before Trump.
[01:00:40.957 --> 01:00:41.957]  It's not about me name dropping.
[01:00:42.037 --> 01:00:43.417]  Oh, I could have been the speaker before Trump.
[01:00:44.518 --> 01:00:48.158]  And I, uh, you know, didn't do it because I'm cool.
[01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:49.719]  No, I was so freaked out.
[01:00:52.279 --> 01:00:57.900]  I was invited like days before Trump got shot and then Trump got shot and they were calling me saying, Mr. Jones, do you want to fly here?
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:58.981]  We'll pay for your first class.
[01:00:59.021 --> 01:00:59.941]  Won't you speak for Trump?
[01:01:00.661 --> 01:01:04.722]  That I was so freaked out about if they killed Trump, nuclear war and all the things I wasn't even thinking about it.
[01:01:05.598 --> 01:01:10.562]  And then he does this incredible speech, and I'm kind of on hindsight, I wish I would have, but that's not why I tell the story.
[01:01:10.902 --> 01:01:12.623]  That's just what happens, so I have to tell the story.
[01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:21.370]  They had me go speak at the big TPUSA events right before JD Vance.
[01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.011]  JD Vance tells me, yeah, I'm the VP.
[01:01:24.432 --> 01:01:27.254]  A month before he announces it, they invite me to all these big Republican things now.
[01:01:28.427 --> 01:01:41.753]  And it's not about me getting invited to the Cool Kid Club, it's that before they cared what the Democratic Party and the New York Times said, now they've listened to my advice in phone calls off the record, where I say, why are you intimidated by them?
[01:01:42.414 --> 01:01:45.295]  Whatever they attack you for, they know that's their weakness.
[01:01:45.335 --> 01:01:46.355]  You want to be radical.
[01:01:46.856 --> 01:01:50.738]  You want to be the real Dukes of Hazzard, but you're not selling moonshine, you're promoting freedom.
[01:01:51.158 --> 01:01:53.499]  Now get that one-minute Dukes of Hazzard promo ready.
[01:01:53.999 --> 01:02:17.345]  This isn't about me telling a story about how I'm the cool kid and I get invited to Mar-a-Lago or I get invited to introduce Trump and then for whatever reason it's not even on my radar because I'm so worried about nuclear war that I just didn't even, it didn't even register and I think that was my subconscious, I think I made the decision that maybe that would hurt Trump and so I made the decision to decline it.
[01:02:19.822 --> 01:02:21.604]  And maybe that's me, actually.
[01:02:21.664 --> 01:02:27.889]  I'm preaching we shouldn't be ashamed of freedom, and then at one level, I actually made the calculation, no, that could hurt Trump, so I'm not going to do it.
[01:02:29.290 --> 01:02:30.811]  Wow, that's a thought.
[01:02:30.831 --> 01:02:33.113]  See, a lot of this is stream of consciousness, folks.
[01:02:33.553 --> 01:02:35.074]  I mean, I'm up here telling you what I really think.
[01:02:36.095 --> 01:02:39.538]  But again, I'm only telling that story, again, like, oh, I got invited to introduce Trump.
[01:02:41.584 --> 01:02:42.565]  That's not why I'm telling the story.
[01:02:42.665 --> 01:02:44.927]  It's that Trump doesn't care now.
[01:02:45.848 --> 01:02:46.969]  I don't think he did care.
[01:02:47.469 --> 01:02:49.591]  But that shows he's really matured.
[01:02:49.611 --> 01:02:51.393]  And all of us have matured.
[01:02:51.413 --> 01:02:52.013]  It's a process.
[01:02:52.033 --> 01:02:53.114]  We learn more all the time.
[01:02:54.596 --> 01:03:01.102]  In understanding that, I remember when Rand Paul first got in the Senate 10 years ago or whatever it was, and I've been a big booster, he was on the show a bunch.
[01:03:02.895 --> 01:03:06.096]  Politico called me and they said, how could we have beaten him?
[01:03:06.757 --> 01:03:09.138]  I said, well, if you would have endorsed him, he probably would have lost.
[01:03:09.558 --> 01:03:15.000]  Because Politico and the mainstream media are so hated, that if you would have acted like he was in the establishment, you would have beaten him.
[01:03:17.601 --> 01:03:19.202]  And of course, they even published that.
[01:03:19.882 --> 01:03:22.163]  And I was glad they did, because that's what they don't get.
[01:03:22.683 --> 01:03:23.423]  They're done.
[01:03:23.664 --> 01:03:24.264]  It's over.
[01:03:26.414 --> 01:03:29.176]  Mainstream media is a reanimated corpse funded by the globalists.
[01:03:29.297 --> 01:03:30.317]  Almost no one watches it.
[01:03:30.738 --> 01:03:32.459]  They can put out some hoaxes and say J.D.
[01:03:32.479 --> 01:03:39.525]  Vance is having sex with couches, totally made up, or Trump hates all Mexicans, totally made up, or I'm peeing on dead kids' graves, all made up.
[01:03:40.146 --> 01:03:45.671]  But at the end of the day, most people know they're liars, so we don't have to respond to it anymore.
[01:03:45.711 --> 01:03:48.153]  It's like, great, the New York Times is attacking me.
[01:03:49.154 --> 01:03:51.436]  And that's where Trump has really, really gotten it.
[01:03:54.511 --> 01:04:03.056]  Yeah, we absolutely should not be ashamed of freedom, and we absolutely need to want the media and the globalist cockroaches to attack us.
[01:04:03.457 --> 01:04:05.698]  All right, we got a great video he just posted.
[01:04:05.718 --> 01:04:09.300]  We're going to air after he leaves us, but I just asked him to come on when I saw his video.
[01:04:09.641 --> 01:04:19.247]  The mighty Ted Nugent, who is on tour, was just in Pennsylvania to giant crowds of patriots, is on fire, and I wanted to get his take.
[01:04:19.827 --> 01:04:21.789]  Well, number one, Alex, thanks for having me on.
[01:04:21.809 --> 01:04:23.892]  I appreciate it because I'm much too humble
[01:04:41.881 --> 01:04:47.325]  And, uh, inconsequential in the final analysis to think that my individual points of view matter.
[01:04:47.685 --> 01:04:52.788]  A guy stopped me on the streets of Pennsylvania yesterday before one of the greatest concerts in the history of rhythm and blues.
[01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:55.390]  And he said, hey, Uncle Ted, I love your political views.
[01:04:55.430 --> 01:05:01.554]  And I stopped immediately, went over, went, son, the Constitution isn't of view.
[01:05:01.734 --> 01:05:06.657]  So, Alex, what you are railing and raising hell for, number one, God bless you.
[01:05:06.677 --> 01:05:07.018]  No, you're right.
[01:05:07.058 --> 01:05:08.038]  It's a way of life.
[01:05:08.098 --> 01:05:09.239]  It's a philosophy.
[01:05:09.759 --> 01:05:10.340]  It's human.
[01:05:11.363 --> 01:05:20.828]  Yeah, well, again, truth, logic, common sense, everything in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, the Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule, are instincts.
[01:05:21.228 --> 01:05:30.393]  And you as a hellraiser, and me as a hellraiser, and Donald Trump as a hellraiser, we are exactly what the founding fathers wanted every American to be.
[01:05:30.773 --> 01:05:34.275]  Not a Mitt Romney who brings a doily to a gunfight.
[01:05:34.315 --> 01:05:40.218]  So everything you spew, Alex Jones, is alive and well on the not-so-mean streets of America.
[01:05:40.658 --> 01:05:48.445]  Truth, logic, and common sense is kryptonite to Uncle Sam, and I'll tell you what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[01:05:48.825 --> 01:06:02.696]  Last night I did a concert, sold out a great, great, it was my 6,945th flame-throwing American soul music, rhythm, blues, rock and roll festival, and I had children secure the roof.
[01:06:03.397 --> 01:06:08.361]  I had children with no security training whatsoever.
[01:06:08.942 --> 01:06:13.045]  Secure the roof within 200 yards of my concert.
[01:06:13.065 --> 01:06:18.769]  Now, obviously, I'm making fun because I know some Secret Service guys that are real white warriors.
[01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:19.710]  They're fire breathers.
[01:06:19.770 --> 01:06:20.991]  I know some FBI guys.
[01:06:21.251 --> 01:06:30.237]  Actually, I don't think there's any more real law enforcement in the FBI, but what you talk about, what you share, what you raise hell about is
[01:06:31.568 --> 01:06:34.190]  Alive and well all across this country.
[01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:37.252]  So Alex Jones, ditto, ditto, ditto.
[01:06:37.513 --> 01:06:39.994]  You're not supposed to bring a doily to a gunfight.
[01:06:40.034 --> 01:06:43.897]  You're supposed to bring an A-10 warthog to a committee hearing.
[01:06:44.458 --> 01:06:47.920]  Our government has lost its balls, it's lost its soul.
[01:06:48.241 --> 01:06:51.723]  The enemy of America is Uncle Sam.
[01:06:52.064 --> 01:06:53.845]  And Alex, that hurts!
[01:06:54.605 --> 01:06:55.126]  I totally agree.
[01:06:55.146 --> 01:07:03.255]  Talking about philosophy and just instinct, you're right, it's not even a political view, it's instinct that God imprinted and stamped on us.
[01:07:14.184 --> 01:07:22.907]  We are at the crossroads of the fact that Trump is intimidated and now came out in Minnesota and said the globalists want to depopulate the earth, they want to kill you, they're your enemy.
[01:07:22.927 --> 01:07:26.228]  I mean, he's getting really hardcore and is a new man.
[01:07:26.268 --> 01:07:37.172]  He was an amazing guy eight years ago when he came down that escalator, but now, or nine years ago, but now, and I know you talk to him a lot, he is on fire and they are shitting bricks.
[01:07:38.593 --> 01:07:42.414]  Well, there are biblical phrases and excerpts
[01:07:43.024 --> 01:07:44.865]  That are instinctual.
[01:07:45.425 --> 01:07:47.105]  I don't have to refer to the Bible.
[01:07:47.125 --> 01:07:48.566]  I'm glad that somebody wrote it down.
[01:07:49.026 --> 01:07:51.547]  But Donald Trump is wearing the armor of God.
[01:07:52.027 --> 01:07:59.470]  The Founding Fathers were touched by the hand of God to get away from kings and emperors and tyrants and furors and slave drivers.
[01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:02.191]  We decided that our instincts drove us.
[01:08:02.737 --> 01:08:07.838]  To experiment in self-government, be in total, individual, independent control of our destiny.
[01:08:08.238 --> 01:08:20.660]  And that's what Donald Trump represents, because on that 13th of July, that was the hand of God turning his head away from a .22 caliber bullet.
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.481]  And Uncle Sam shot him.
[01:08:25.041 --> 01:08:26.041]  Uncle Sam!
[01:08:26.061 --> 01:08:28.862]  And I dare those bureaucrat punks
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:43.657]  To come and knock on my door, attempt to kick down my door, because I am a free American, and I live by the self-evident truth as outlined in those sacred documents where the only experiment in self-government is allowed in the history of humankind.
[01:08:43.977 --> 01:08:46.200]  And again, Alex, I know you know this.
[01:08:46.761 --> 01:08:48.623]  But you are touched by the hand of God.
[01:08:48.663 --> 01:08:50.004]  You're wearing the armor of God.
[01:08:50.044 --> 01:08:54.308]  You and I and Donald Trump and other patriots who will not back down.
[01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:59.974]  We were sent for times such as this and we love you for that.
[01:09:00.314 --> 01:09:05.860]  We pray for you because you and I and Donald Trump and real patriots, we are
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:07.181]  Ted, you're totally right.
[01:09:07.201 --> 01:09:09.863]  And before you gotta go, you're a gun expert, bow expert, world-renowned.
[01:09:27.415 --> 01:09:29.256]  Talking to the people that were there, everything has come out.
[01:09:29.296 --> 01:09:41.744]  They now confirm 90 minutes they were tracking him, 26 minutes on the roof, rangefinders, the SWAT teams have released their text messages, he's casing the joint, he's getting ready to do something, and the Secret Service did nothing.
[01:09:41.804 --> 01:09:46.827]  I'm not blaming the low-level, but obviously higher-ups, this is an inside job, a stand-down.
[01:09:47.108 --> 01:09:49.169]  You were saying Uncle Sam shot him, I agree.
[01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:50.710]  Elaborate on that briefly.
[01:09:52.287 --> 01:09:57.470]  Well, I'm afraid the Deep State is more widespread than we originally thought.
[01:09:57.510 --> 01:10:10.998]  We knew it existed following Eisenhower's speech in 1953 warning us about the CIA being the enemies of mankind, the enemies of America, the enemies of freedom, and the industrial-military-congressional complex.
[01:10:11.078 --> 01:10:14.740]  I mean, there should be a curriculum in the schools, because now
[01:10:15.467 --> 01:10:23.093]  The Deep State includes the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, the entire gang with all the power and all the guns.
[01:10:23.734 --> 01:10:31.780]  They hate freedom, they hate people who dedicate ourselves to be in the asset column, and they know that Donald Trump represents that.
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:38.105]  Nobody I know, and I know some pretty dumb people, but the dumbest people I know would not have
[01:10:40.188 --> 01:10:46.671]  Chuck, how powerful was it when he's so quick at 78 years old to get nicked, instantly dropped,
[01:11:07.372 --> 01:11:08.392]  Then they all get around him.
[01:11:08.732 --> 01:11:11.953]  He rolls the dice to stand up and be defiant and says, fight, fight, fight.
[01:11:12.333 --> 01:11:16.834]  That is as iconic as anything I have ever seen.
[01:11:16.854 --> 01:11:19.794]  In fact, I mean, that is the most iconic thing I've seen in my life.
[01:11:20.134 --> 01:11:21.755]  It is so inspiring across the world.
[01:11:21.795 --> 01:11:25.675]  And then Google has blocked searches of this until today because of pressure.
[01:11:26.396 --> 01:11:33.457]  If you typed in Donald, you would get ducked and could not search Donald Trump the last two days as they tried to block this information technician.
[01:11:34.611 --> 01:11:42.016]  I think I can draw the conclusion that is irrefutable, Alex, that Donald Trump as a Tyrannosaurus Rex scrotum.
[01:11:42.296 --> 01:11:49.601]  This guy got more balls than Parnelli Jones as he took me around the IndyTrack at 200 miles an hour and I was scared like a little girl.
[01:11:50.462 --> 01:12:03.071]  This man was literally sent to save America, to identify the vulgarity, the obscenity, the corruption, the criminality of Uncle Sam and his entire bureaucratic gang of snakes.
[01:12:03.741 --> 01:12:26.066]  And by him being touched by God and just turning slightly as that 223 round went by his head and clipped his ear, that's all the proof that we need that he is divine intervention and that anybody who has a problem with Donald Trump is anti-American, anti-human, and anti-freedom, and it's our job, Alex,
[01:12:26.434 --> 01:12:32.336]  To educate and prod, beseech, beg, cajole, punch if you have to.
[01:12:32.756 --> 01:12:36.957]  We have to get everybody to vote for Donald Trump in our family.
[01:12:37.017 --> 01:12:43.579]  You can't have any fence-sitters anymore if we don't vote as a unified constitutional conservative
[01:12:44.199 --> 01:13:01.191]  Independent, free people for Donald Trump in November, we might as well bend over and spread our cheeks because Uncle Sam is the snake, he's the devil, whatever that freak punk is that pretends to be Joe Biden is no commander-in-chief in the world I live in.
[01:13:01.491 --> 01:13:06.238]  Ted Nugent, in closing, and I can't wait to come hang out with you and your wife and do some shooting again.
[01:13:06.258 --> 01:13:06.979]  That's been amazing.
[01:13:06.999 --> 01:13:12.306]  Back when you were back in Texas, where were you when you learned it happened, when you saw it happened?
[01:13:12.366 --> 01:13:17.613]  And then just briefly, I know you're a ballistics guy, but I've done a lot of hunting, a lot of shooting, nothing like you, but more than most.
[01:13:18.474 --> 01:13:21.956]  I can't tell you how many times I've gotten two shots off at a hog 400 yards away.
[01:13:22.417 --> 01:13:33.023]  He moves, I nick him, don't think I hit him, I shoot again, hit him in the side, knock him over, and when I drive over on the four-wheeler or the ATV, I see where I just barely nicked him across the back.
[01:13:33.083 --> 01:13:34.904]  It's a little bit of blood's coming out, a little bit of nick.
[01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:40.007]  The left are so ignorant about ballistics, just like Chuckie Schumer cooks, you know, raw hamburger and serves it to people.
[01:13:40.027 --> 01:13:41.568]  I mean, they're literally like aliens.
[01:13:42.329 --> 01:13:45.458]  They think that a bullet, if it nicked him, would blow his ear off.
[01:13:45.719 --> 01:13:48.086]  They don't understand grazing and are trying to say it's fake.
[01:13:49.471 --> 01:13:51.492]  Well, how about punk-ass Christopher Wray?
[01:13:51.512 --> 01:13:52.532]  How about the gangster?
[01:13:52.892 --> 01:14:02.496]  How about the punk-ass Christopher Wray, who claims it wasn't even a bullet hitter with shrapnel, as if how shrapnel can somehow materialize prior to the bullet getting there?
[01:14:02.716 --> 01:14:05.757]  I mean, what kind of freak is Christopher Wray?
[01:14:06.097 --> 01:14:09.879]  Who would ever obey a command by Christopher Wray?
[01:14:10.139 --> 01:14:14.620]  If you obey a command by Christopher Wray, I got something you might understand.
[01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:20.081]  A bunch of soulless little sheep.
[01:14:21.162 --> 01:14:22.303]  Where were you when you found out?
[01:14:23.663 --> 01:14:25.625]  I literally was here in the swamps of Michigan.
[01:14:25.665 --> 01:14:28.046]  I had just come in from training with a SWAT team.
[01:14:28.086 --> 01:14:31.368]  I have a new M4 and I'm shooting some new Remington Corelock ammo.
[01:14:31.828 --> 01:14:37.292]  I had just come in so I was kind of high on brass rainbows and aim small, miss small, discipline martial arts.
[01:14:37.692 --> 01:14:39.633]  I came in and my phone blew up.
[01:14:40.262 --> 01:14:42.884]  And all my friends say, turn on the TV, turn on the TV.
[01:14:42.944 --> 01:14:46.587]  And when they say that, like on 9-11, I didn't ask why.
[01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:50.951]  I immediately turned it on, and they had just replayed the live footage.
[01:14:50.971 --> 01:14:55.935]  So I was only less than two minutes behind the actual real-time shooting.
[01:14:56.435 --> 01:14:58.036]  And I'll tell you, my heart sank.
[01:14:58.076 --> 01:14:59.217]  You're right, Alex.
[01:14:59.257 --> 01:15:05.082]  This was the moment of infamy in the history of our lives, as our own government
[01:15:06.789 --> 01:15:12.991]  He denies the democratic process of voting for the people of our choice.
[01:15:13.291 --> 01:15:18.532]  They couldn't indict him, they couldn't imprison him, they couldn't hurt him, so they tried to kill him.
[01:15:18.832 --> 01:15:26.974]  Anybody that doesn't get that, call 1-800-NUMNUT and Michael Moore will explain why personal hygiene is totally unnecessary.
[01:15:27.454 --> 01:15:29.374]  Alright, TedNugent.com.
[01:15:30.314 --> 01:15:31.195]  Last question, I promise.
[01:15:31.535 --> 01:15:32.375]  You were gracious, come on.
[01:15:34.584 --> 01:15:36.645]  How did your beautiful, amazing wife, Shemay, take this?
[01:15:38.846 --> 01:15:40.067]  She's such an activist.
[01:15:40.107 --> 01:15:43.049]  She has a Real America voice, faith, and freedom, Alex.
[01:15:43.109 --> 01:15:47.411]  Everybody should find Shemay Nugent's Real America voice, faith, and freedom.
[01:15:47.511 --> 01:15:49.453]  She has become such a warrior.
[01:15:49.793 --> 01:15:58.378]  She has inspired so many apathetic fence-sitters to re-engage in this fought, blood, and guts paid for agreement.
[01:15:58.578 --> 01:15:59.899]  She's a real-life Valkyrie.
[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:03.982]  Yeah, she's a fireball.
[01:16:04.062 --> 01:16:09.646]  She's not only the sexiest and most dangerous bowhunter in the world, but she is a real We the People activist.
[01:16:09.926 --> 01:16:11.367]  Alex, thank you for having me on.
[01:16:11.407 --> 01:16:13.289]  If people would go to TedNugent.com.
[01:16:13.589 --> 01:16:15.791]  Last night we sold something.
[01:16:15.811 --> 01:16:20.655]  10,000 flags that has an AR-15 on it that says, I will not comply.
[01:16:20.995 --> 01:16:23.017]  And you can get that at TedNugent.com.
[01:16:23.057 --> 01:16:27.660]  But tune into Real America's Voice, Shemane's Faith and Freedom, and My Spirit Campfire.
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:31.083]  We're raising hell because that's our job as an American.
[01:16:31.533 --> 01:16:32.373]  Ted, thank you very much.
[01:16:33.473 --> 01:16:34.034]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:16:34.074 --> 01:16:34.554]  Godspeed.
[01:16:35.874 --> 01:16:36.614]  I had one more question.
[01:16:36.634 --> 01:16:37.374]  I forgot to ask it.
[01:16:38.895 --> 01:16:40.335]  What would have happened if they killed Trump?
[01:16:42.175 --> 01:16:45.616]  He was sending me text messages like 20 minutes ago, 25 minutes ago.
[01:16:45.636 --> 01:16:48.437]  I said, hey, why don't you just come on the air and say all this?
[01:16:49.177 --> 01:16:49.657]  So he did.
[01:16:50.137 --> 01:16:51.297]  He has the hotline number.
[01:16:51.317 --> 01:16:52.557]  I didn't even know he was going to call in.
[01:16:52.577 --> 01:16:53.438]  I just said, why don't you call in?
[01:16:56.670 --> 01:16:58.691]  You know, that's the whole topic we should do a whole show on.
[01:16:58.771 --> 01:17:00.291]  What would have happened if they killed Trump?
[01:17:00.971 --> 01:17:02.291]  Or put him in a vegetative state?
[01:17:04.432 --> 01:17:07.473]  Because those 5-5-6 rounds are nasty when they hit bone.
[01:17:08.473 --> 01:17:09.373]  It hit him in the temple.
[01:17:10.693 --> 01:17:11.614]  Shot bone in the brain.
[01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:14.995]  Bare minimum, Trump would have been vegetative.
[01:17:16.495 --> 01:17:20.476]  And then... The globalists knew that.
[01:17:22.396 --> 01:17:24.917]  So how did they kill Trump but still look like victims?
[01:17:27.335 --> 01:17:29.056]  They staged terror attacks right after.
[01:17:29.076 --> 01:17:32.517]  All right.
[01:17:32.597 --> 01:17:37.158]  I didn't know I was going to have Ted Nugent on, so I thought we'd have time to take a bunch of calls this hour, but it's okay.
[01:17:37.178 --> 01:17:41.520]  We're going to take some on any subject you want that I've already raised or anything you want to bring up.
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:46.881]  First time, longtime callers, but we're going to take... Let's take eight phone calls.
[01:17:47.141 --> 01:17:47.922]  That way I get to everybody.
[01:17:48.042 --> 01:17:52.103]  I had Judge Joe Brown, who's an amazing insider.
[01:17:52.123 --> 01:17:54.984]  I don't mean like a bad insider, but he was like one of the first
[01:17:56.377 --> 01:17:58.217]  Prominent black lawyers, black judges.
[01:17:58.277 --> 01:17:59.258]  He knew Joe Biden.
[01:17:59.298 --> 01:18:00.178]  He knew the Democrats.
[01:18:00.218 --> 01:18:01.478]  He was inside their councils.
[01:18:01.518 --> 01:18:03.099]  He knew all about Kamala years later.
[01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:06.319]  He is going to destroy her and take the gloves off coming up.
[01:18:06.379 --> 01:18:07.520]  He's hated her for years.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:13.521]  And so you want to tune into this coming up in about 37 minutes from now, 36 minutes from now.
[01:18:14.881 --> 01:18:16.102]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:18:16.122 --> 01:18:16.242]  877-789-Alex.
[01:18:16.262 --> 01:18:16.382]  877-789-2539er.
[01:18:26.584 --> 01:18:31.945]  All right, Nugent mentioned some of this, but let me just show you the headlines.
[01:18:32.045 --> 01:18:35.065]  There's a bunch of newscasts and video of this and text messages.
[01:18:35.125 --> 01:18:39.146]  I mean, it's even in Forbes and AP, so it's, they're not even denying it now.
[01:18:39.626 --> 01:18:46.247]  Thomas Matthew Crooks, the supposed shooter, we know there was probably another one, spotted 90 minutes before a Trump assassination attempt, report says.
[01:18:47.488 --> 01:18:53.929]  Pennsylvania SWAT sniper says Trump shooter just seemed out of the place, as officer warned a gunman beforehand.
[01:18:54.129 --> 01:18:55.089]  Rangefinder, everything.
[01:18:56.004 --> 01:18:56.625]  We're good to go.
[01:19:20.838 --> 01:19:23.939]  And meanwhile, Google memory holes attempted assassination of Trump.
[01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:26.299]  We couldn't even search it for two days, now it's back up.
[01:19:26.319 --> 01:19:27.740]  Because they got caught.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:30.821]  Just amazing.
[01:19:31.801 --> 01:19:35.602]  Trump's defending the Secret Service lady that couldn't reholster her gun.
[01:19:36.382 --> 01:19:37.422]  People thought that she was fake.
[01:19:37.522 --> 01:19:39.083]  I mean, I'm sorry, she's incompetent.
[01:19:39.363 --> 01:19:40.363]  But Trump's trying to be nice.
[01:19:40.803 --> 01:19:41.343]  That's how he is.
[01:19:41.503 --> 01:19:41.963]  Too nice.
[01:19:43.404 --> 01:19:45.624]  But she did shield him, so he's saying he forgives her.
[01:19:46.084 --> 01:19:48.025]  FBI confirms Donald Trump was struck by a bullet.
[01:19:48.165 --> 01:19:48.585]  They pee.
[01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:53.403]  Trump agrees to give victim interview to the FBI after assassination attempt.
[01:19:53.724 --> 01:19:57.245]  He should do a after action victim report about how they victimized him.
[01:19:58.045 --> 01:20:00.006]  He's gonna meet with them about how he's a victim?
[01:20:00.627 --> 01:20:01.547]  They're asking to meet with him?
[01:20:01.927 --> 01:20:03.828]  Probably try to set him up like the General Flynn at that.
[01:20:05.729 --> 01:20:11.411]  Video of Trump shooting appears to show suppressed rifle fire from first floor window under Crooks.
[01:20:11.651 --> 01:20:13.892]  Yep, very important report, InfoWars.com.
[01:20:15.553 --> 01:20:19.315]  CIA denies using MKUltra mind control programming on Trump shooter.
[01:20:22.097 --> 01:20:22.577]  Okay.
[01:20:23.558 --> 01:20:25.739]  Bears deny going to the bathroom in the woods.
[01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:28.181]  So I've covered that.
[01:20:29.341 --> 01:20:30.442]  I need to hit this.
[01:20:30.522 --> 01:20:33.484]  I've mentioned this, but it's a big deal.
[01:20:35.325 --> 01:20:38.947]  So I'll briefly hit this when we come back and then go to your phone calls.
[01:20:39.948 --> 01:20:43.190]  Biden's coming to Austin to announce new tyranny.
[01:20:43.210 --> 01:20:45.932]  And it's very serious.
[01:20:46.332 --> 01:20:49.594]  Packing the Supreme Court and two other horrible things.
[01:20:51.032 --> 01:20:54.093]  We're gonna go to break, but I want you to listen to me very, very carefully.
[01:20:55.273 --> 01:20:57.314]  We cannot run this operation without you.
[01:20:57.414 --> 01:20:58.194]  I need your support.
[01:20:58.214 --> 01:20:59.975]  I'm asking for your aid and comfort.
[01:21:00.075 --> 01:21:05.676]  I'm asking you to make the decision to go to drjonesnaturals.com, our amazing sponsor, that is separate from M4s.
[01:21:05.716 --> 01:21:08.917]  Even if they shut this down, it'll be our sponsor in the future to relaunch.
[01:21:08.957 --> 01:21:09.717]  So it's so critical.
[01:21:09.777 --> 01:21:12.058]  Plus, the products are game-changing.
[01:21:13.598 --> 01:21:15.279]  Next Level Foundational Energy is not a stimulant.
[01:21:15.699 --> 01:21:22.784]  It is the breakdown of what creates energy in the cells and flushes the cells out with other key nutritive compounds to supercharge it.
[01:21:23.304 --> 01:21:25.766]  Next Level Foundational Energy is selling out despite that.
[01:21:26.106 --> 01:21:28.147]  It's still discounted at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:21:28.668 --> 01:21:31.189]  All the nano silver products are very close to selling out.
[01:21:31.209 --> 01:21:42.757]  The nano silver toothpaste with the iodine, the tea tree, and the other organic oils like peppermint, no fillers, the wound gel, the immune gargle, it's all selling out.
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:47.161]  Drjonesnaturals.com, despite that, it's on sale.
[01:21:47.181 --> 01:21:48.762]  And then Cabo Chill is not a depressant.
[01:21:49.363 --> 01:21:52.124]  It naturally relaxes you, but you're still focused and clear.
[01:21:52.584 --> 01:21:56.546]  So many afternoons, I've been working since 4 a.m., I'm exhausted, I can't relax.
[01:21:57.487 --> 01:22:01.749]  I'll take a couple Cabo Chill, 30 minutes later, it's like I'm rested.
[01:22:01.789 --> 01:22:03.370]  It's like I'm awake, but calm.
[01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:06.432]  It's different than, because I don't like, you know, depressants.
[01:22:06.492 --> 01:22:07.672]  I mean, I like alcohol, but that's about it.
[01:22:07.692 --> 01:22:08.593]  I don't like other depressants.
[01:22:09.363 --> 01:22:11.124]  But I do really like Comet Chill.
[01:22:11.224 --> 01:22:15.546]  It's there, several different versions of that at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:22:15.566 --> 01:22:17.787]  There's Rocket Rest, an incredible natural sleep aid.
[01:22:18.068 --> 01:22:20.009]  There's Top Brain, a powerful nootropic.
[01:22:20.029 --> 01:22:25.411]  If you like the nootropics in InfoWars, you'll love the nootropics at drjonesnaturals.com because he designed them with top developers.
[01:22:25.451 --> 01:22:26.152]  These are the next level.
[01:22:26.792 --> 01:22:29.174]  DRJONESNATURALS.COM.
[01:22:29.794 --> 01:22:32.135]  That's where you find so many amazing products.
[01:22:32.155 --> 01:22:35.417]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but now's the time for action.
[01:22:35.678 --> 01:22:37.779]  With 98 days left of the election, support Infowars.
[01:22:38.019 --> 01:22:38.679]  We support Trump.
[01:22:38.699 --> 01:22:39.340]  We support you.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.101]  DRJONESNATURALS.COM.
[01:22:41.141 --> 01:22:41.982]  The ball's in your court.
[01:22:42.002 --> 01:22:42.382]  Stay with us.
[01:22:42.882 --> 01:22:46.165]  This is a real attempt to turn America and the world around.
[01:22:46.185 --> 01:22:48.187]  This is a real attempt to stop World War III.
[01:22:48.207 --> 01:22:51.189]  This is a real attempt to save civilization for our children.
[01:22:51.389 --> 01:22:54.212]  Because there's not just evil in the world, there's good as well.
[01:22:54.572 --> 01:23:01.798]  And so you've got to decide that that's happening, and join it, and promote it, and support Trump, and support us, and spread the word.
[01:23:01.838 --> 01:23:06.422]  Because that's what they fear, is when you get a mission, and you get committed, and you take action.
[01:23:06.442 --> 01:23:08.224]  So tell everybody about the links at Rolex Jones.
[01:23:08.604 --> 01:23:09.324]  Share the article.
[01:23:09.364 --> 01:23:10.005]  Share the videos.
[01:23:10.065 --> 01:23:10.986]  Follow us at Rolex Jones.

[01:23:17.370 --> 01:23:18.410]  Get things you need.
[01:23:18.691 --> 01:23:20.092]  It takes money to win a war.
[01:23:20.572 --> 01:23:24.834]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:23:24.915 --> 01:23:27.276]  A big sale going on right now.
[01:23:27.616 --> 01:23:29.317]  Everybody needs nitric mousse.
[01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:31.238]  It cleans out your blood and flushes all this crap out.
[01:23:31.459 --> 01:23:35.481]  Everybody needs the nano silver toothpastes and products at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:23:35.901 --> 01:23:36.942]  This is a war!
[01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:49.175]  The big assault is coming with 98 days left of the Democratic Party crime syndicate in full control.
[01:23:49.255 --> 01:24:00.765]  Then, in the next 79 after Trump is elected, if we override their fraud with too big to rig, they are going to unleash Sybil unrest and paint Trump as Hitler 2.0.
[01:24:02.146 --> 01:24:04.748]  But now, they're telling us what their plan is.
[01:24:06.029 --> 01:24:08.952]  Two weeks ago, when Biden was still claiming he would never step down,
[01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:18.255]  They would not tell anyone why he was coming to speak at the LBJ Presidential Library at University of Texas at Austin.
[01:24:19.376 --> 01:24:25.441]  But now, as of last night, they have told us what the plan is in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.
[01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:35.388]  And as we speak, he is getting on Marine One to get on the airplane, Air Force One, and fly and land at Bergstrom International Airport, the former head of SAC Command.
[01:24:37.056 --> 01:24:38.517]  They will then block off the highways.
[01:24:38.577 --> 01:24:41.939]  He will travel and speak this evening at the University of Texas.
[01:24:41.979 --> 01:24:43.561]  But he's not the real president.
[01:24:43.621 --> 01:24:44.541]  We all know that.
[01:24:46.362 --> 01:24:47.603]  So, this is what I'm getting at.
[01:24:47.924 --> 01:24:49.064]  Several big angles here.
[01:24:49.224 --> 01:24:50.926]  And what the agenda is, they now admit it.
[01:24:51.506 --> 01:24:53.908]  Most Americans want Biden to resign now.
[01:24:54.588 --> 01:24:55.749]  In multiple polls.
[01:24:56.229 --> 01:25:01.573]  And a lot of conservatives in Congress are saying, if it's 25th Amendment, secretly, he needs to go regardless.
[01:25:02.654 --> 01:25:03.855]  He's not in control anyways.
[01:25:04.994 --> 01:25:13.777]  You don't want to elevate Kamala to president and give her the power and legitimacy in the next 98 days, in the next 79 after that.
[01:25:14.038 --> 01:25:16.899]  We'll put it up on screen, the combined days are how many?
[01:25:16.919 --> 01:25:24.942]  Because it's not just getting to the election, now it's getting through that period of 79 days when Trump is president-elect.
[01:25:26.437 --> 01:25:31.280]  So, it is a no-brainer, and I've talked to the top of the Trump campaign, they agree with me.
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:36.004]  I called them this weekend and I said, obviously, I'm seeing a lot of Republicans, 174 days to the inauguration.
[01:25:37.284 --> 01:25:38.745]  That's the real number, 174, not 98.
[01:25:39.246 --> 01:25:42.448]  And they said, yeah, we know, good advice, we're on it.
[01:25:43.989 --> 01:25:47.612]  I'm like, well, Congress and the Republicans are trying to remove him, you don't want that.
[01:25:47.632 --> 01:25:48.712]  And they're like, we know, we know.
[01:25:48.772 --> 01:25:49.453]  I was like, okay, good.
[01:25:50.987 --> 01:25:54.948]  I'm not gonna say who I talked to, but I talked to the top people, multiple people.
[01:25:55.409 --> 01:25:56.809]  They said, we know, we get it, you're right.
[01:25:56.849 --> 01:25:58.049]  I'm like, okay, well then what's going on?
[01:25:58.250 --> 01:25:58.770]  We're trying.
[01:25:59.670 --> 01:26:03.391]  So, everybody running around celebrating like we're gonna get a scalp getting rid of Biden.
[01:26:03.431 --> 01:26:04.552]  You do not want that.
[01:26:05.092 --> 01:26:06.112]  And you don't want him killed.
[01:26:06.132 --> 01:26:07.353]  You don't want any of that.
[01:26:07.833 --> 01:26:08.533]  They might do that.
[01:26:08.813 --> 01:26:09.773]  Hell, they might kill him in Austin.
[01:26:09.793 --> 01:26:10.114]  Who knows?
[01:26:10.154 --> 01:26:11.494]  I'm not predicting it, I'm just saying.
[01:26:12.054 --> 01:26:13.935]  I said that he would step down on the 20th or 21st.
[01:26:13.975 --> 01:26:16.436]  Weeks before it happened, boom, called the date.
[01:26:16.456 --> 01:26:17.696]  Figured it would take about two weeks.
[01:26:17.716 --> 01:26:18.436]  I looked at the calendar.
[01:26:18.496 --> 01:26:19.077]  There it is.
[01:26:21.305 --> 01:26:24.147]  Because again, we don't use a targeting computer like Luke Skywalker.
[01:26:24.187 --> 01:26:26.769]  We use the force, which is God.
[01:26:27.489 --> 01:26:30.531]  So, most Americans want Biden to resign now.
[01:26:31.632 --> 01:26:32.353]  Okay, great.
[01:26:32.453 --> 01:26:35.875]  Well, you get Kamala bombshell, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:36.516 --> 01:26:40.519]  Biden in Austin, security expected to be tight for the president's visit.
[01:26:41.319 --> 01:26:45.302]  Yeah, they're blocking airspace off at 30 miles because he's the president, but Trump's the real president.
[01:26:45.322 --> 01:26:46.483]  He has no airspace control.
[01:26:48.066 --> 01:26:49.026]  Biden in Austin.
[01:26:49.127 --> 01:26:53.789]  Austinites advised to expect airport travel, traffic, public transport delays.
[01:26:54.729 --> 01:27:01.272]  And here is the 30 miles out, no flight, including the airport, while he's here.
[01:27:01.972 --> 01:27:09.336]  Total delays, total, and then going out 80 miles, partial control.
[01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:14.834]  So, here's the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal.
[01:27:15.795 --> 01:27:20.236]  Joe Biden, my plan to reform the Supreme Court and ensure no president is above the law, like he is.
[01:27:20.917 --> 01:27:25.458]  Biden to push for a constitutional amendment next week to reverse Trump immunity decision report.
[01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:29.220]  Biden rolls out plan to overhaul the Supreme Court.
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:33.081]  So, let me tell you what's in the announcements.
[01:27:34.522 --> 01:27:37.003]  The headlines say three things, but I read it, it's actually four.
[01:27:38.103 --> 01:27:52.231]  He wants to announce a plan, as Pocahontas, Senator Warren announced a few nights ago, we played it at the start of the show, to pack the Supreme Court, where the Democrats still have control of Congress, so they now nominate 5, 10, 15, who knows?
[01:27:54.152 --> 01:27:59.154]  New people they control, so they put them all on, so for the foreseeable future, they control the court.
[01:28:00.135 --> 01:28:04.437]  Then they want term limits on the Supreme Court, but not term limits for themselves.
[01:28:06.418 --> 01:28:07.319]  Then they want a
[01:28:08.885 --> 01:28:18.549]  The Czar set up an Inspector General with the Justice Department and the Executive they want to control over the Supreme Court, which is a constitutional crisis, and mixes the three branches of government.
[01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.970]  There's one other thing here.
[01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:24.651]  I just read it earlier, but I had to read a bunch of articles to get it all together, because there's four things.
[01:28:24.671 --> 01:28:37.837]  So there's pack the Supreme Court, term limits, have an Inspector General over the Supreme Court, and there's one other thing.
[01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:42.712]  Oh yeah, citizenship for illegals, but yeah, that's not in the Supreme Court angle.
[01:28:44.633 --> 01:28:45.614]  It'll pop in my head in a minute.
[01:28:47.215 --> 01:28:47.596]  Oh, that's right.
[01:28:47.836 --> 01:28:48.276]  The big one.
[01:28:48.316 --> 01:28:49.177]  The big one he's talking about.
[01:28:49.797 --> 01:28:51.078]  Reverse the immunity.
[01:28:51.498 --> 01:28:52.899]  They didn't say add total immunity.
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:59.384]  They said the way you do it is you impeach him or you vote him out or there's the three branches of governments are not separated.
[01:28:59.724 --> 01:29:00.865]  So I forgot the most important one.
[01:29:00.885 --> 01:29:01.566]  Good job, crew.
[01:29:01.886 --> 01:29:02.787]  Thomas popping in my ear.
[01:29:03.627 --> 01:29:08.611]  So that's his big announcement is that he wants to overhaul the immunity
[01:29:10.034 --> 01:29:14.018]  And he's misrepresenting that, oh, he can kill whoever he wants, he can do whatever he wants.
[01:29:14.158 --> 01:29:15.980]  None of that is true.
[01:29:18.663 --> 01:29:19.184]  Yeah, here it is.
[01:29:19.244 --> 01:29:22.788]  Biden to push for constitutional amendment next week to reverse Trump immunity decision.
[01:29:23.288 --> 01:29:27.773]  But bigger than that, which is a constitutional crisis, is packing the Supreme Court.
[01:29:28.193 --> 01:29:30.476]  That is massive.
[01:29:31.778 --> 01:29:41.843]  Again, if the president doesn't have basic immunity other than impeachment or being voted out, any controlled prosecutor by George Soros could take him out anytime they want, which you've seen.
[01:29:42.623 --> 01:29:44.724]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:29:44.744 --> 01:29:45.604]  Appreciate you calling.
[01:29:45.624 --> 01:29:52.688]  We talked to Daniel and Tim and Leo and Brad and Jack and Rich and Hammer Time and Craig.
[01:29:53.911 --> 01:29:56.052]  Hey Alex, appreciate you taking my call.
[01:29:56.072 --> 01:30:00.235]  The first thing I want to talk about is a detail that I don't think anyone else has talked about.
[01:30:00.255 --> 01:30:00.675]  Moments before
[01:30:23.106 --> 01:30:25.247]  The supposed crooks or whoever shot.
[01:30:25.687 --> 01:30:36.551]  The moments before that happened, a police officer climbed up on the roof, engaged, distracted the shooter, and within moments after that, the shooter started taking shots.
[01:30:37.711 --> 01:30:38.691]  No, that's right.
[01:30:38.731 --> 01:30:40.272]  I didn't know he engaged.
[01:30:40.312 --> 01:30:42.993]  He said he saw him and then called.
[01:30:43.053 --> 01:30:45.334]  Are you saying there's another report he engages and shot him?
[01:30:45.354 --> 01:30:48.074]  He engages and he looked at him.
[01:30:48.134 --> 01:30:49.075]  He distracted him.
[01:30:49.135 --> 01:30:50.175]  No, that's confirmed.
[01:30:50.535 --> 01:30:51.776]  He's made his presence aware.
[01:30:53.383 --> 01:30:55.245]  After that, Crooks started taking shots.
[01:30:55.485 --> 01:30:58.548]  I don't think that was the exact moment those shots were planned to be taken.
[01:30:59.089 --> 01:31:04.374]  Therefore, all the other shooters that were there, whether it's one extra shooter, two extra shooters... No, no, that's right.
[01:31:04.774 --> 01:31:13.463]  One lone officer not following orders with a stand down, which we know happened for 90 minutes, just popping up and saying something, put them off balance and put the timetable off.
[01:31:14.611 --> 01:31:15.992]  And thank God for that officer.
[01:31:16.152 --> 01:31:19.894]  I would love to know personally who that officer is, and I would love to hear from that person.
[01:31:19.934 --> 01:31:21.075]  He probably needs to be protected.
[01:31:21.595 --> 01:31:22.836]  He may not even still be around.
[01:31:22.876 --> 01:31:23.236]  Who knows?
[01:31:23.676 --> 01:31:24.177]  No, I agree.
[01:31:24.217 --> 01:31:26.618]  Trump should have him the next rally.
[01:31:28.299 --> 01:31:33.022]  That guy is a hero, an absolute hero, that has not been recognized.
[01:31:33.142 --> 01:31:34.583]  And when I first heard that, I thought,
[01:31:35.313 --> 01:31:37.054]  That guy knew, he knew what he was doing.
[01:31:37.314 --> 01:31:38.495]  Oh, that came out the next day.
[01:31:38.515 --> 01:31:48.241]  That's confirmed that the officer kept calling it in for like 30 minutes, and he finally crawled up, saw the guy on the roof, and said something to him, and then went to get more people, and yeah.
[01:31:49.741 --> 01:31:49.982]  Boom.
[01:31:50.122 --> 01:31:50.942]  Shot started happening.
[01:31:51.983 --> 01:31:53.464]  Completely, completely changed.
[01:31:53.484 --> 01:32:00.307]  That's part of the modern system where we're taking power from police, where if they even defend themselves, they go to prison, so they've been gelded.
[01:32:00.328 --> 01:32:04.210]  I mean, I'm not putting the officer down, but if I saw a guy with a rifle on a roof, I'd go ahead and shoot him.
[01:32:05.575 --> 01:32:06.095]  Absolutely.
[01:32:06.796 --> 01:32:09.298]  He probably didn't want to put his family in danger in that way.
[01:32:10.739 --> 01:32:12.440]  And that's because you see it.
[01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:13.821]  I mean, you see what they do to police all day.
[01:32:15.402 --> 01:32:16.323]  Plausible deniability.
[01:32:16.343 --> 01:32:17.264]  He can be like, oh, I didn't know.
[01:32:17.304 --> 01:32:18.324]  I thought it already happened.
[01:32:18.505 --> 01:32:30.293]  He probably is way smarter than we realize and ran through all the scenarios, put himself in that situation, said I can do just enough to disrupt this, and it worked.
[01:32:30.754 --> 01:32:33.796]  The next thing I want to talk about that I've been seeing is
[01:32:34.614 --> 01:32:37.115]  Zuckerberg and Elon Musk.
[01:32:37.956 --> 01:32:39.636]  Elon Musk fully on Trump's side.
[01:32:39.656 --> 01:32:42.478]  He's completely, you know, where he needs to be.
[01:32:42.518 --> 01:32:46.860]  Anybody that said that I was promoting Musk last six months and I was wrong, they've been proven wrong.
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:48.921]  Elon Musk is all in.
[01:32:50.462 --> 01:32:53.063]  Well, these are, you know, these are, they're still individuals.
[01:32:53.103 --> 01:32:54.424]  They still can make their own decisions.
[01:32:54.824 --> 01:32:56.645]  But Zuckerberg is 40 years old.
[01:32:56.705 --> 01:32:56.825]  I'm 37.
[01:32:58.371 --> 01:32:59.392]  He's 40 years old.
[01:32:59.452 --> 01:33:00.333]  He's been a billionaire.
[01:33:00.373 --> 01:33:04.736]  He's been crazy rich for most of his life, a good portion of his life.
[01:33:05.617 --> 01:33:14.443]  I think what has happened is he's been exposed to the globalist, elitist, evil plan enough to say, I don't know that I want to support this.
[01:33:15.404 --> 01:33:17.666]  I have so much more to consider in my life.
[01:33:17.746 --> 01:33:20.528]  And I think he's slowly trying to separate himself
[01:33:23.703 --> 01:33:26.265]  No, you're right.
[01:33:26.326 --> 01:33:28.788]  No, he's starting to slowly slide our way.
[01:33:28.988 --> 01:33:29.889]  And we should give him amnesty.
[01:33:29.909 --> 01:33:33.774]  If he comes over to us, boom, come on.
[01:33:34.034 --> 01:33:37.057]  That's what I warn listeners about is we have to be ready to win.
[01:33:37.077 --> 01:33:40.581]  We have to be ready to win and everybody start coming over to our side.
[01:33:40.621 --> 01:33:42.063]  We've got to have that attitude because we're there.
[01:33:45.323 --> 01:33:52.969]  Zuckerberg is obviously a major, heavy hitter, huge influential person in modern day communication technology.
[01:33:52.989 --> 01:33:53.730]  He stole the election.
[01:33:54.211 --> 01:33:57.033]  Out of all the players, he was the MVP in Steel in 2020.
[01:33:58.134 --> 01:34:02.458]  And he sort of admitted that, and he also said that he kind of regrets it.
[01:34:02.578 --> 01:34:05.441]  I've done things in the past that I won't repeat.
[01:34:05.621 --> 01:34:09.825]  I didn't choose a side, but I feel like he has chosen a side.
[01:34:11.118 --> 01:34:15.282]  Being silent in these situations can also be detrimental, like we don't want that from anybody.
[01:34:15.302 --> 01:34:16.724]  No, no, but I agree.
[01:34:16.964 --> 01:34:22.269]  Let me tell you, we will offer Zuckerberg immunity if he just comes out for Trump.
[01:34:25.472 --> 01:34:32.880]  That would be, I mean, I can't even imagine the kind of over-report that would have if we could just have Facebook, obviously now Twitter,
[01:34:33.729 --> 01:34:35.592]  Just simply not interfere.
[01:34:35.892 --> 01:34:36.633]  I'm not saying yes.
[01:34:36.954 --> 01:34:38.676]  Would I love them to push for Trump?
[01:34:38.696 --> 01:34:38.936]  Sure.
[01:34:39.297 --> 01:34:40.819]  But I'm for fair elections.
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:43.943]  Daniel, you're making great points, but I got to get to the next person.
[01:34:43.983 --> 01:34:44.584]  Amazing call.
[01:34:44.985 --> 01:34:46.086]  Brad in Pennsylvania.
[01:34:46.106 --> 01:34:46.467]  Go ahead.
[01:34:46.487 --> 01:34:46.947]  You're on the air.
[01:34:46.968 --> 01:34:47.248]  Welcome.
[01:34:48.089 --> 01:34:48.570]  Hey, Alex.
[01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:49.451]  How are you doing today?
[01:34:49.811 --> 01:34:50.753]  Great talking to you again.
[01:34:51.505 --> 01:34:55.788]  Hey, I wanted to mention, you said, what would happen if Trump would have been killed?
[01:34:55.848 --> 01:34:57.149]  I'll tell you what would have happened.
[01:34:57.229 --> 01:35:02.833]  This was, and the CIA is full of shit, excuse my French, for saying that they didn't have anything to do with this.
[01:35:03.253 --> 01:35:04.934]  That's complete nonsense.
[01:35:05.315 --> 01:35:07.516]  They pulled that right out of the RFK playbook.
[01:35:08.076 --> 01:35:11.719]  In 68, RFK was going to win the Democratic nomination.
[01:35:12.019 --> 01:35:15.221]  They hit him in California before the convention.
[01:35:15.642 --> 01:35:18.944]  That's exactly what they did this time, except they missed, barely.
[01:35:19.648 --> 01:35:21.029]  And they blamed it on a 20-year-old.
[01:35:21.109 --> 01:35:24.551]  Sirhan Sirhan was like 21, patsy, just like Crook.
[01:35:24.631 --> 01:35:26.572]  Admittedly drugged up under MKUltra.
[01:35:26.912 --> 01:35:30.674]  The guy that really shot RFK was admitted CIA, Skunk Works.
[01:35:31.355 --> 01:35:32.215]  There was more than one.
[01:35:32.655 --> 01:35:34.857]  He wasn't the only one, but yeah, he put a bullet in his head.
[01:35:35.557 --> 01:35:38.979]  And this shooter wasn't Crook.
[01:35:38.999 --> 01:35:46.083]  There was a couple shooters in that other building with an open window with a direct line of sight to Trump.
[01:35:46.838 --> 01:35:49.079]  So this is a CIA hit the whole way.
[01:35:49.539 --> 01:35:56.022]  I agree, and imagine how upset they are with the Secret Service, FBI stand down that they missed eight shots.
[01:35:56.042 --> 01:36:00.965]  They've got to really know Trump's got God behind him.
[01:36:01.645 --> 01:36:02.825]  Oh, it's unbelievable.
[01:36:03.065 --> 01:36:05.847]  We're so blessed, he's so blessed, and he's so lucky.
[01:36:06.087 --> 01:36:10.669]  I just hope he knows it and leans on God going forward.
[01:36:10.729 --> 01:36:12.910]  I'm told Trump is ten times more hardcore now.
[01:36:13.130 --> 01:36:14.791]  Hell, he just came out and said the globals want to kill you!
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:24.724]  What's amazing about this whole thing is that Bobby Kennedy's son is involved in a race, and I can't even imagine what RFK Jr.
[01:36:24.764 --> 01:36:29.107]  went, what emotions he must have went through watching what happened to Trump.
[01:36:29.167 --> 01:36:30.187]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:36:30.207 --> 01:36:31.048]  Because he was right there.
[01:36:31.068 --> 01:36:32.689]  Because they filled his dad full of holes.
[01:36:33.686 --> 01:36:36.407]  Yeah, and that's so well covered up.
[01:36:36.587 --> 01:36:38.927]  That's what woke me up before you did.
[01:36:39.227 --> 01:36:43.168]  When I was really young, I studied JFK, and that was obvious, okay?
[01:36:43.228 --> 01:36:45.509]  Then I moved on, and I said, what happened to his brother?
[01:36:46.249 --> 01:36:48.629]  He was killed in the middle of the night out on the East Coast.
[01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:51.290]  It was like midnight, and they covered it up so well.
[01:36:51.410 --> 01:36:59.332]  They covered it up by putting a special unit center investigation together in the LAPD, but it was really run by the CIA.
[01:37:00.405 --> 01:37:02.006]  And so they just covered it up.
[01:37:02.246 --> 01:37:03.906]  All the witnesses were badgered.
[01:37:04.027 --> 01:37:06.047]  Everybody, you know, eyewitness testimony.
[01:37:06.087 --> 01:37:11.189]  People coming down the firewall saying, we shot him, we shot him.
[01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:12.950]  And they covered that up.
[01:37:13.711 --> 01:37:14.071]  Unbelievable.
[01:37:14.151 --> 01:37:21.974]  Even the Guardian reported a decade ago that there were six high-level CIA agents, officers, in the crowd at the Ambassador Hotel.
[01:37:21.994 --> 01:37:23.314]  In the ballroom, that's correct.
[01:37:23.354 --> 01:37:24.335]  They were all over the place.
[01:37:24.455 --> 01:37:25.115]  It was obvious.
[01:37:27.501 --> 01:37:28.101]  Cut and dry.
[01:37:28.841 --> 01:37:31.882]  So what would have happened if they killed Trump?
[01:37:32.962 --> 01:37:35.583]  You were going to finish that and then imagine what they're going to do now.
[01:37:35.603 --> 01:37:36.303]  They're not going to stop.
[01:37:37.484 --> 01:37:38.684]  No, they're not going to stop.
[01:37:38.704 --> 01:37:39.464]  You're probably right.
[01:37:39.964 --> 01:37:44.745]  But now they've got, you know, they're trying to pull out their, you know, the narrative, change the narrative.
[01:37:44.765 --> 01:37:45.726]  That's what they always do.
[01:37:46.046 --> 01:37:52.167]  Just like you said about Biden coming to Austin, you know, I don't get it.
[01:37:52.247 --> 01:37:54.408]  I mean, we're in a deep state.
[01:37:55.226 --> 01:37:56.688]  I'm trying, brother.
[01:37:56.708 --> 01:37:57.009]  Thank you.
[01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:19.935]  I go intellectually off my decisions, but then I also follow the spirit.
[01:38:20.736 --> 01:38:24.943]  And I thought I'd been hit by the spirit with intense warning before.
[01:38:25.223 --> 01:38:26.225]  Nothing is compared to this.
[01:38:26.665 --> 01:38:27.266]  I am so...
[01:38:29.770 --> 01:38:31.211]  I've been saying prayers like five times a day.
[01:38:31.231 --> 01:38:32.933]  God just turned down the discernment.
[01:38:33.013 --> 01:38:34.154]  I'm like, I can't handle this.
[01:38:34.314 --> 01:38:36.156]  This is like full war mode.
[01:38:36.256 --> 01:38:38.338]  I mean, we are, this is going down, folks.
[01:38:38.378 --> 01:38:38.958]  This is it.
[01:38:39.419 --> 01:38:42.561]  The whole future of our country and the world, they're going to have World War III if we don't stop this.
[01:38:43.022 --> 01:38:45.043]  I mean, I cannot ascribe to you, and I think you all know this.
[01:38:45.063 --> 01:38:45.724]  You don't need me to tell you.
[01:38:46.024 --> 01:38:47.125]  This is, this is epic.
[01:38:47.946 --> 01:38:48.867]  Jack in Maryland.
[01:38:48.907 --> 01:38:49.527]  Thanks for calling.
[01:38:49.547 --> 01:38:50.768]  Thanks for holding her on the air, Jack.
[01:38:50.788 --> 01:38:51.129]  Go ahead.
[01:38:52.230 --> 01:38:52.950]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:53.911]  First time caller.
[01:38:54.111 --> 01:38:54.412]  Welcome.
[01:38:55.325 --> 01:38:57.186]  So I've got two points I wanted to cover.
[01:38:57.207 --> 01:39:04.912]  So the first thing I wanted to talk about is a solution for a lot of people, how to get out of the city or any suburbs and stuff like that.
[01:39:05.893 --> 01:39:10.977]  So the USDA offers what's called a Section 502 Rural Development Home Loan.
[01:39:11.498 --> 01:39:15.981]  This is a no-money-down home loan to either build or buy your own house in a rural area.
[01:39:16.001 --> 01:39:21.946]  There's, I think, three qualifications for the loan.
[01:39:23.052 --> 01:39:27.093]  United States citizen, first off.
[01:39:27.273 --> 01:39:29.674]  21 years or older and two years of tax return.
[01:39:29.754 --> 01:39:33.895]  So that qualifies a whole hell of a lot of people.
[01:39:35.015 --> 01:39:44.838]  And yeah, you can also, you might be able to pull this up on the screen, but you can look up USDA Rural Development Eligibility Map and you can see what qualifies.
[01:39:46.759 --> 01:39:49.600]  But I'm actually like an hour still from D.C.
[01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:51.200]  and Baltimore, so I'm not out in the boonies.
[01:39:52.282 --> 01:39:55.584]  Essentially, so that, um, I think a lot of people can benefit from that.
[01:39:55.664 --> 01:40:04.230]  And the interest rates for that program, I just checked a few months ago, they're four and a half percent, which is extremely low compared to, you know, the rest.
[01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:04.590]  No, you're right.
[01:40:04.630 --> 01:40:06.151]  We can use the system against it.
[01:40:06.391 --> 01:40:06.812]  Absolutely.
[01:40:06.832 --> 01:40:07.952]  I'm aware of programs like that.
[01:40:08.012 --> 01:40:09.353]  It's so smart to get into rural areas.
[01:40:09.694 --> 01:40:15.177]  And who cares if you're just a farmer, you pump gas, your kids aren't going to be caught, you know, taught how to cut their genitals off.
[01:40:15.818 --> 01:40:17.199]  Whoever can get out of the city, get out.
[01:40:18.219 --> 01:40:18.920]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:20.801]  And so it's no, no money down.
[01:40:21.618 --> 01:40:22.758]  Extremely low interest rate.
[01:40:22.798 --> 01:40:26.060]  I think a lot of people could, um, you know, qualify for that.
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:33.283]  And then the other thing was, so my buddy had done a job at the White House years, maybe two, three years ago or something.
[01:40:34.023 --> 01:40:36.384]  And, uh, he was like, yeah, I met Biden.
[01:40:36.464 --> 01:40:39.605]  And, you know, I was like, you know, was he gaffing?
[01:40:39.645 --> 01:40:40.485]  Was he funny or whatever?
[01:40:40.525 --> 01:40:44.727]  He's like, no, he's like, the one thing that I noticed though, is he was really, really tall.
[01:40:45.067 --> 01:40:47.468]  And I was like, that's weird.
[01:40:47.528 --> 01:40:48.068]  I Googled it.
[01:40:48.108 --> 01:40:49.069]  I was like, he's six foot.
[01:40:49.149 --> 01:40:49.749]  And then, um,
[01:40:50.526 --> 01:40:53.967]  You know, now we see this double that's, like, significantly taller.
[01:40:53.987 --> 01:40:58.888]  Yeah, I mean, I don't like to get into conspiracies like that, but the face looks different.
[01:40:58.968 --> 01:40:59.989]  It's a different person.
[01:41:00.269 --> 01:41:03.870]  Of course, we're in the middle of a coup, so who knows if Biden's even alive.
[01:41:04.650 --> 01:41:05.650]  Well, I just, exactly.
[01:41:05.690 --> 01:41:06.690]  That's what made me think of that.
[01:41:06.730 --> 01:41:09.571]  I was like, this wasn't, you know, some camera event.
[01:41:09.711 --> 01:41:12.392]  Like, they would just shovel this guy off whenever they needed him.
[01:41:12.432 --> 01:41:18.754]  But now the fact that he's in, you know, on TV, that super tall version is a little odd to me, so.
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:20.161]  Very odd.
[01:41:20.221 --> 01:41:21.622]  Hey, great points about that.
[01:41:21.882 --> 01:41:27.526]  And again, everybody who can, if you've got to stay in the city like we do because of Infowars, I get it.
[01:41:28.047 --> 01:41:35.893]  But if you can get some backup, I don't care if it's a crappy trailer, folks, and a garden, you want to hedge your bets because there's a good chance this thing's going down.
[01:41:36.053 --> 01:41:39.216]  I mean, you do not want to be in a city when America goes belly up.
[01:41:39.276 --> 01:41:45.521]  And I'd say, you know, God's got his hand on Trump and America, and if we pray and are politically active, we may be able to turn this around.
[01:41:46.789 --> 01:41:47.429]  Yeah, Jones, you got me?
[01:41:47.449 --> 01:41:48.510]  So, yeah, I wanted to talk about...
[01:42:01.368 --> 01:42:02.309]  Camilla real quick.
[01:42:02.829 --> 01:42:07.233]  She looks like she could be like upper class Indian mafia.
[01:42:07.613 --> 01:42:13.577]  And I've been seeing a lot of Indians getting hired in key like government positions.
[01:42:13.678 --> 01:42:16.920]  And we all know that Indians are very good at scam likely.
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:20.123]  So I think we just got to watch out for organized crime.
[01:42:22.444 --> 01:42:23.145]  People like that.
[01:42:23.991 --> 01:42:37.865]  Well, I mean, nothing against Indians, but they are the most populous group in the world, and there's a lot of different groups within it, but definitely Indians tend to be more pre-market, but they also, you know, on average, you know, tend to be running some scams, just on average, there's a percentage that doesn't.
[01:42:38.066 --> 01:42:39.727]  I'm not saying most of them do it, but it's definitely there.
[01:42:40.909 --> 01:42:44.933]  But yeah, she's definitely not black, and so that's definitely an angle going on.
[01:42:46.098 --> 01:42:55.304]  So yeah, I love Indians, especially ones like Dinesh D'Souza, but what I'm saying is, that's organized crime, and the Indians are very organized and very good at it.
[01:42:55.664 --> 01:42:59.507]  Another group that I've heard about was the Ukrainian Intelligence.
[01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:00.828]  Oh, they're huge.
[01:43:00.868 --> 01:43:02.189]  Their use is a major cutout.
[01:43:03.382 --> 01:43:06.644]  Yeah, they're very dangerous and they can probably get really technical.
[01:43:06.964 --> 01:43:16.030]  And then there's other groups like the Mexican Mafia is the richest mafia on the planet right now after 20 million illegal immigrants got smuggled through them.
[01:43:16.410 --> 01:43:17.811]  So they got Bezos money now.
[01:43:20.092 --> 01:43:23.334]  And these type of people we need to really look at because they're dangerous.
[01:43:24.034 --> 01:43:24.655]  Well, that's right.
[01:43:24.695 --> 01:43:32.880]  I mean, remember when Pelosi said MS-13's all God's children, we know the Democrats are using Latin mafias as their enforcers.
[01:43:34.318 --> 01:43:37.160]  Yes, and MS-13 is just El Salvadorian.
[01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:44.465]  They're not really, you know, the news makes a big deal about them, but they're not as big as these other mafias in Mexico, really.
[01:43:44.725 --> 01:43:47.548]  I mean, they literally have $350 billion right now.
[01:43:49.689 --> 01:43:50.229]  Absolutely.
[01:43:50.249 --> 01:43:51.070]  Appreciate your call.
[01:43:51.130 --> 01:43:51.670]  Great points.
[01:43:52.631 --> 01:43:53.912]  Let's go to Rich in New Jersey.
[01:43:53.972 --> 01:43:54.653]  Rich, thanks for holding.
[01:43:54.673 --> 01:43:54.933]  Go ahead.
[01:43:56.460 --> 01:43:57.660]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:59.621]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:44:00.381 --> 01:44:07.443]  I heard you two weeks ago saying that you saw Ronald Reagan at some point in your life in my hometown of Bloomfield, New Jersey.
[01:44:08.143 --> 01:44:14.765]  June 13, 1985, I had the great honor and privilege to see Ronald Reagan talk about his new tax reform.
[01:44:14.825 --> 01:44:24.908]  And let me tell you something, Alex, for over two hours that we were waiting in a much smaller venue, town hall in front of me, post office behind me,
[01:44:25.672 --> 01:44:34.228]  In the perimeter there was Secret Service guys on every single building and it was hot as hell and they didn't move an inch and as far as the eye could see
[01:44:36.022 --> 01:44:37.183]  It's like a no-brainer.
[01:44:37.343 --> 01:44:39.344]  It's a no-brainer how old this is.
[01:44:39.404 --> 01:44:40.285]  This is unbelievable.
[01:44:40.345 --> 01:44:42.746]  I just wanted to make a concise point.
[01:44:42.766 --> 01:44:52.391]  And 450 feet away, the closest building, nobody on it, with the building behind it, 50 feet behind it, the Secret Service Command Center, looking onto the roof, where he was for 26 minutes.
[01:44:52.471 --> 01:44:58.955]  It was a stand-down, just like Ted Nugent said 45 minutes ago, this was Uncle Sam trying to kill President Trump.
[01:45:00.859 --> 01:45:09.222]  I mean, like I said, the first thought when I heard you say that after the shooting that you had saw Reagan, I said, I got to call him to the phone, call him to the show.
[01:45:09.403 --> 01:45:13.324]  Oh yeah, when he was in Dallas, they had, my dad goes, look son, that's a Stinger missile.
[01:45:13.344 --> 01:45:14.645]  And back then nobody even knew what that was.
[01:45:15.045 --> 01:45:19.527]  And they had Secret Service up there and I saw him, you know, with the missile, it's like a tube with a box on it.
[01:45:19.947 --> 01:45:22.148]  And I've seen that before at the White House when I've covered it.
[01:45:22.708 --> 01:45:25.171]  Well, you know, this is my whole thing.
[01:45:25.211 --> 01:45:30.057]  Just listening to all the hearings, with the Senate hearings, with the FBI, and then with Sheatland and everything, and it's like,
[01:45:42.515 --> 01:45:44.438]  You don't have to be an expert on anything.
[01:45:44.478 --> 01:45:46.701]  You just have to have a little common sense.
[01:45:46.821 --> 01:45:53.330]  It's really ridiculous how people, their minds are so programmed into the deep state, they have no idea.
[01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:54.571]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:45:54.611 --> 01:45:57.195]  But I just wanted to make a quick point, and I thank you very much.
[01:45:57.675 --> 01:45:58.276]  Thank you, brother.
[01:45:58.296 --> 01:45:58.997]  Really appreciate you.
[01:45:59.017 --> 01:45:59.438]  We're going to break.
[01:46:00.836 --> 01:46:04.517]  I'm going to jam in Craig and Leo before Judge Brown Joneses.
[01:46:04.917 --> 01:46:09.559]  You don't want to miss this interview coming up on Kamala Harris and her real background.
[01:46:10.119 --> 01:46:14.900]  Judge Joe Brown, Judge Joe Brown TV on X. That is all coming up.
[01:46:15.441 --> 01:46:16.161]  Please remember.
[01:46:17.287 --> 01:46:20.570]  I need you to support our sponsor, DRJonesNaturals.com.
[01:46:21.330 --> 01:46:30.318]  All the patented nano silver products for your immune system, your body, the toothpaste, so good for your teeth, the Next Level Foundational Energy, the Comet Show, the Top Brain.
[01:46:30.758 --> 01:46:33.861]  Go to the site, peruse it, and get a product, get some products.
[01:46:34.361 --> 01:46:36.923]  That's how you support the show, plus you get great products in the mail.
[01:46:38.304 --> 01:46:39.665]  DRJonesNaturals.com.
[01:46:39.725 --> 01:46:40.906]  I cannot do this without you.
[01:46:40.926 --> 01:46:43.909]  And then separately, we're almost sold out of everything.
[01:46:44.738 --> 01:46:46.920]  They tried to shut us down, as you know, six, seven weeks ago.
[01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:47.620]  We're still here.
[01:46:48.341 --> 01:46:51.503]  There's a lot of hoops we've got to jump through, but a good chance we're going to stay on the air indefinitely.
[01:46:51.983 --> 01:46:53.304]  But we're selling out of all the products.
[01:46:53.344 --> 01:47:02.191]  The X2, the X3, the Nitric Boost, the Ultra 12, the Vazo Beats, the Ultimate Fish Oil.
[01:47:02.831 --> 01:47:03.992]  It's almost all sold out.
[01:47:05.813 --> 01:47:07.675]  And when that sells out, we've got to go to sponsorship.
[01:47:09.383 --> 01:47:15.329]  Hold us over to see if we can maneuver in court and get a buyer for the assets to keep us on air.
[01:47:15.389 --> 01:47:16.150]  I don't know that's gonna happen.
[01:47:16.190 --> 01:47:16.931]  I put it in God's hands.
[01:47:17.291 --> 01:47:18.272]  God's come through so much.
[01:47:18.332 --> 01:47:18.853]  It's amazing.
[01:47:19.773 --> 01:47:20.714]  But we need support now.
[01:47:21.876 --> 01:47:22.756]  Plus, they're great products.
[01:47:23.217 --> 01:47:24.298]  Please, this is real.
[01:47:24.338 --> 01:47:30.985]  This isn't like all the other Netflix and TV shows, entertainment, or a football game, or a baseball game, or a basketball game, or the Olympics.
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:34.041]  This is the hardcore tip of the spear.
[01:47:34.101 --> 01:47:37.702]  The White House, the real White House, Trump, listens to what we're saying, what we're doing.
[01:47:37.742 --> 01:47:40.183]  We reach millions and millions and millions and millions a day.
[01:47:40.623 --> 01:47:41.643]  So keep us on air.
[01:47:42.044 --> 01:47:45.325]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com and get the great products.
[01:47:45.365 --> 01:47:47.606]  But Dr. Jones Naturals is separate from InfoWars.
[01:47:47.666 --> 01:47:51.267]  Even if InfoWars shut down, mark down InfoWars Store, but also Dr. Jones.
[01:47:51.887 --> 01:47:53.388]  We've seen a lot of people
[01:47:55.342 --> 01:48:04.225]  And a lot of corporate media and a lot of pundits, and I see a lot, thousands of articles, the last month saying, Infowars will imminently be shut down.
[01:48:05.746 --> 01:48:12.508]  And they panicked with a federally appointed CRO and federally appointed U.S.
[01:48:12.548 --> 01:48:17.630]  trustee from the Justice Department, and five weeks ago, ordered this place shut without a court order.
[01:48:18.922 --> 01:48:22.664]  The judge excoriated them, fired them three weeks ago.
[01:48:22.684 --> 01:48:30.628]  Then two weeks ago, the Democrat Party lawyers that use the Sandy Hook parents as a front group came in and said, we want him shut down today.
[01:48:31.028 --> 01:48:32.269]  The judge shut that down.
[01:48:32.849 --> 01:48:36.571]  Then they tried to grab Infowars a week and a half ago at the state court.
[01:48:36.631 --> 01:48:38.472]  The judge said, that's illegal and shut that down.
[01:48:38.712 --> 01:48:39.332]  This is epic.
[01:48:39.792 --> 01:48:41.193]  People say, how is this continuing on?
[01:48:41.253 --> 01:48:42.154]  Because we're fighting.
[01:48:42.734 --> 01:48:43.574]  We're not giving up.
[01:48:43.594 --> 01:48:44.335]  You're praying.
[01:48:45.035 --> 01:48:46.897]  But I love how five weeks ago, I told you this happened.
[01:48:46.917 --> 01:48:49.038]  I'm like, oh yeah, they came out in order to shut it down.
[01:48:49.639 --> 01:48:50.760]  You stood up to them and all this.
[01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:51.400]  Where's the video?
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:54.243]  You want on top of that video confronting people?
[01:48:54.603 --> 01:48:55.424]  This is serious.
[01:48:55.464 --> 01:48:56.364]  I tried to not escalate.
[01:48:57.445 --> 01:48:58.586]  Now it's all in the court record.
[01:48:58.806 --> 01:48:59.507]  Of course it's true.
[01:48:59.527 --> 01:49:00.608]  Of course I didn't make this up.
[01:49:00.668 --> 01:49:01.428]  I don't cry wolf.
[01:49:02.449 --> 01:49:09.155]  So, we are surrounded by wolves, but we've got God on our side and we've got the people that love God supporting us.
[01:49:09.195 --> 01:49:14.319]  So, I need all of you to understand that we're still here for at least three months.
[01:49:15.472 --> 01:49:21.516]  But if people think we're not going to be here and don't support InfoWareStore.com with great sales and great products, we'll shut down by extension.
[01:49:21.556 --> 01:49:22.177]  That's been happening.
[01:49:22.437 --> 01:49:23.458]  People aren't buying stuff.
[01:49:24.138 --> 01:49:26.039]  Even though we're selling all the products, it's gone away.
[01:49:26.059 --> 01:49:27.120]  Do they think we're about to be shut down?
[01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:27.320]  No.
[01:49:27.681 --> 01:49:28.841]  You order something, you get it.
[01:49:29.202 --> 01:49:36.507]  And so it'll be you that decides to shut us down if you don't go there and get X2 and X3 and Vitamineral Fusion about to sell it and all of it.
[01:49:36.947 --> 01:49:39.289]  But what I want to talk to you about is a fundraiser.
[01:49:39.989 --> 01:49:48.193]  We have a couple thousand copies of the number one worldwide bestseller, The Great Awakening, The Plan to Defeat the Globalists and Launch the Next Great Renaissance.
[01:49:48.753 --> 01:49:50.033]  Huge thick book I wrote.
[01:49:50.554 --> 01:49:51.934]  Just came out six, eight months ago.
[01:49:52.955 --> 01:49:55.756]  There are a few thousand signed copies left, and it is a fundraiser.
[01:49:55.776 --> 01:50:00.018]  I want to thank those of you that got a signed copy, but I want to encourage all of you
[01:50:01.650 --> 01:50:11.152]  That have not gotten a signed copy and you want a chance to support the broadcast and know that at the critical juncture you fought to get the funds in to keep operating because we're right on the edge of the red and the black.
[01:50:12.272 --> 01:50:18.834]  To go now to infowarsstore.com and get The Great Awakening today.
[01:50:18.894 --> 01:50:23.215]  And there's almost 3,000 copies left of the signed, 1,000 copies unsigned.
[01:50:24.155 --> 01:50:28.116]  There's also about 700 copies of The Great Reset, the predecessor book to this.
[01:50:30.283 --> 01:50:33.765]  And unless we get a buyer and things change and, you know, whatever, we'll be shut down in a few months.
[01:50:33.825 --> 01:50:36.427]  But we will probably continue on.
[01:50:36.507 --> 01:50:37.548]  God's hand is on us.
[01:50:37.608 --> 01:50:38.428]  The force is with us.
[01:50:39.269 --> 01:50:40.469]  Please go now.
[01:50:40.729 --> 01:50:48.434]  It's in stock, ready to ship at infowarestore.com and get The Great Awakening, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:48.454 --> 01:50:51.596]  Defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[01:50:51.716 --> 01:50:55.118]  And when these signed copies are gone here, they're going to be gone.
[01:50:55.178 --> 01:50:57.520]  I'm going to sign this right now.
[01:51:00.233 --> 01:51:05.817]  2024.
[01:51:00.474 --> 01:51:05.817]  And I thank you for everything you do to support us.
[01:51:05.877 --> 01:51:07.278]  And this will be put in the warehouse.
[01:51:07.679 --> 01:51:10.060]  Somebody will get this book.
[01:51:10.601 --> 01:51:11.962]  Put a little something extra on there.
[01:51:14.163 --> 01:51:14.483]  All right.
[01:51:14.584 --> 01:51:16.705]  So, I appreciate you.
[01:51:16.845 --> 01:51:21.829]  Get The Great Awakening, Defeating the Globalists, and Launching the Next Great Renaissance.
[01:51:23.306 --> 01:51:31.471]  Myself, Alex Jones, Ken Heckenleibig, I'll put it together with a foreword by Stephen K. Bannon, who's a political prisoner right now in Connecticut in jail.
[01:51:32.272 --> 01:51:34.093]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:51:34.113 --> 01:51:35.073]  We're betting on you.
[01:51:35.413 --> 01:51:36.514]  We believe on you.
[01:51:36.854 --> 01:51:38.695]  But we cannot do this without your support.
[01:51:39.116 --> 01:51:39.716]  Get a copy.
[01:51:39.756 --> 01:51:40.937]  Sign or unsign now.
[01:51:41.257 --> 01:51:44.099]  The last copies at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:51:44.119 --> 01:51:46.260]  And I humbly thank you all for your support.
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:47.601]  Now, please take action.
[01:51:51.479 --> 01:51:55.481]  One of my favorite guests, Judge Joe Brown, coming up in T-minus six minutes.
[01:51:55.501 --> 01:52:00.663]  But right now, let's jam in some calls from Craig and Leo here on the Alex Jones Show third hour.
[01:52:01.083 --> 01:52:03.164]  Craig in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[01:52:03.204 --> 01:52:03.524]  Go ahead.
[01:52:06.265 --> 01:52:06.925]  Can you hear me fine?
[01:52:07.145 --> 01:52:07.385]  I can.
[01:52:07.425 --> 01:52:07.645]  Go ahead.
[01:52:07.665 --> 01:52:09.686]  All right.
[01:52:09.806 --> 01:52:16.129]  First thing I want to say is common sense today is so rare that it now can be considered a superpower.
[01:52:17.770 --> 01:52:21.231]  Literally, the main thing I wanted to call about
[01:52:21.658 --> 01:52:33.302]  Was, uh, the CrowdStrike outage, um, not really in to do with the CrowdStrike outage, but I was trying to buy some products because I understand exactly what you're talking about.
[01:52:33.883 --> 01:52:39.625]  And so I went to buy some products and I got redirected multiple times by CrowdStrike.
[01:52:40.745 --> 01:52:48.648]  Kept rerouting me, kept rerouting me to a website with a false address that looked identical to your address.
[01:52:49.981 --> 01:53:04.729]  And then I tried to email your help support, and then when I emailed your help support to let, like, you guys know, like, this is going on, I went back and I went to your website, and I got routed to the actual InfoWars website.
[01:53:05.089 --> 01:53:06.310]  And then I bought Broadot.
[01:53:07.170 --> 01:53:08.691]  But it took, it, I have,
[01:53:09.537 --> 01:53:13.781]  Probably 15, 20 different screenshots of CrowdStrike redirecting me.
[01:53:14.281 --> 01:53:16.103]  Alright, in a minute I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:53:16.423 --> 01:53:17.324]  I want your info.
[01:53:17.864 --> 01:53:24.430]  I want to give you, give him Blake's email and I want to talk to you because we've been under such cyber attack since they attacked Trump.
[01:53:24.630 --> 01:53:26.372]  That's why when you go there it says, are you a human?
[01:53:26.392 --> 01:53:29.534]  We have to put that up to block it and we use the main systems to do it.
[01:53:30.335 --> 01:53:32.237]  But yeah, I mean that sounds like a dirty trick to me.
[01:53:33.923 --> 01:53:35.564]  No, this wasn't you guys.
[01:53:35.604 --> 01:53:36.904]  This was literally us.
[01:53:36.924 --> 01:53:38.585]  No, I'm not saying, obviously it's not us.
[01:53:38.685 --> 01:53:40.706]  I'm saying, what do you think it was?
[01:53:42.266 --> 01:53:51.769]  I think it was CrowdStrike redirecting your sales, at the same time stealing your money, at the same time giving people fraud products that is actually hurting them.
[01:53:52.590 --> 01:53:55.031]  Yeah, we use a different site than CrowdStrike.
[01:53:56.891 --> 01:54:01.473]  Yeah, so I have, like I said, I have like 20 different screenshots.
[01:54:02.188 --> 01:54:05.229]  Of multiple times trying to get to InfoWars.com.
[01:54:06.050 --> 01:54:09.131]  You know, watching a broadcast, go to InfoWars.com.
[01:54:09.812 --> 01:54:12.873]  And then I went, and immediately I got grabbed by CrowdStrike.
[01:54:13.353 --> 01:54:20.657]  And I used to work at E. We don't use that service, so they would have to be using their control of the web to somehow redirect it somehow.
[01:54:21.837 --> 01:54:22.517]  Precisely.
[01:54:22.597 --> 01:54:23.378]  And that's what I think.
[01:54:23.678 --> 01:54:25.759]  And I think that's why your sales are so low.
[01:54:26.642 --> 01:54:33.990]  Because they are manipulating it and they are literally grabbing it and then they're re-warehousing your product so it's not even your product.
[01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:37.434]  They're just labeling it like your product and sending people poison.
[01:54:40.471 --> 01:54:45.334]  I don't think they did the whole cyber attack on the airlines and the banks for us.
[01:54:46.455 --> 01:54:47.976]  But there's all sorts of stuff going on.
[01:54:47.996 --> 01:54:49.437]  It might be your computer's compromised.
[01:54:50.057 --> 01:54:50.738]  You personally.
[01:54:51.478 --> 01:54:53.400]  But that's very interesting and I appreciate your call.
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:54.941]  Leo in Arizona.
[01:54:55.321 --> 01:54:56.122]  Get his number though.
[01:54:56.142 --> 01:54:56.502]  Get his info.
[01:54:56.522 --> 01:54:57.002]  I want to see it.
[01:54:57.142 --> 01:54:57.823]  So get his info.
[01:54:58.663 --> 01:54:59.344]  Thank you, Craig.
[01:54:59.664 --> 01:55:00.545]  We'll look into it.
[01:55:00.705 --> 01:55:01.645]  We don't use that service.
[01:55:01.705 --> 01:55:04.527]  It might be your computer's been compromised.
[01:55:04.868 --> 01:55:06.209]  I mean, there's so many scams online.
[01:55:06.549 --> 01:55:07.329]  Leo in Arizona.
[01:55:07.349 --> 01:55:07.810]  You're on the air.
[01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:08.090]  Go ahead.
[01:55:09.156 --> 01:55:10.116]  Alex Jones!
[01:55:10.336 --> 01:55:11.077]  Hey, brother.
[01:55:11.657 --> 01:55:13.717]  I've been listening to you for about 15 years.
[01:55:13.797 --> 01:55:15.298]  It's my first time calling in, though.
[01:55:16.418 --> 01:55:17.378]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:55:17.578 --> 01:55:17.878]  Thank you.
[01:55:17.918 --> 01:55:18.198]  Go ahead.
[01:55:18.278 --> 01:55:26.300]  So, today, I just wanted to bring up, it's kind of a split-tongue, sneaky-steak moment by Christopher Wray.
[01:55:27.641 --> 01:55:33.702]  If the crew could, if you guys could pull up the clip of him getting asked how many shots were fired by the shooter.
[01:55:33.902 --> 01:55:34.322]  He said eight.
[01:55:34.362 --> 01:55:37.203]  If you listen, he said eight, but
[01:55:37.754 --> 01:55:42.877]  If you listen very closely, he's asked how many shots were fired.
[01:55:43.417 --> 01:55:50.440]  He responds, there were eight, and then he pauses and he says, cartridges recovered from the roof.
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:53.322]  Yeah, so that's why he's saying he thinks it was eight.
[01:55:54.742 --> 01:55:57.544]  Right, but Alex, you know firearms very well.
[01:55:58.186 --> 01:55:59.747]  A cartridge is a full round.
[01:55:59.987 --> 01:56:04.748]  A shell casing would be what's ejected from the rifle after a shot's been fired.
[01:56:05.248 --> 01:56:08.089]  So maybe it's nothing, but maybe it's something.
[01:56:08.109 --> 01:56:10.050]  You know how these people like to lie with words.
[01:56:10.710 --> 01:56:12.130]  Well, Christopher Wray would never lie.
[01:56:13.611 --> 01:56:18.352]  I mean, yeah, I mean, he's really one of my favorite guys, you know, but I'm sure he's telling the truth.
[01:56:20.473 --> 01:56:21.473]  Leo, sorry I had to jump.
[01:56:21.513 --> 01:56:22.093]  Thanks for getting in.
[01:56:22.113 --> 01:56:23.014]  We'll investigate that.
[01:56:23.054 --> 01:56:23.454]  Good point.
[01:56:25.034 --> 01:56:27.116]  All right, Judge Joe Brown is our guest.
[01:56:27.196 --> 01:56:30.058]  Coming up straight ahead, the deep dive on Kamala Harris.
[01:56:30.699 --> 01:56:32.921]  And we mean the deep dive beyond the knee pads.
[01:56:33.581 --> 01:56:40.087]  Straight ahead, InfoWars.com forward slash show, banned out video, and false on X at Real Alex Jones, because you are the Paul Reveres.
[01:56:41.068 --> 01:56:42.049]  Use X now, folks.
[01:56:42.089 --> 01:56:43.690]  It's a very effective weapon against tyranny.
[01:56:44.271 --> 01:56:46.392]  Kamala Harris will never win this election.
[01:56:47.369 --> 01:56:49.030]  She's a total joke in her own party.
[01:56:49.130 --> 01:56:49.770]  She's an idiot.
[01:56:50.530 --> 01:56:51.571]  And her record is horrible.
[01:56:52.311 --> 01:57:00.274]  But she is new in the people's minds, and the system wants us to believe that she could win the election because they plan to steal it.
[01:57:00.314 --> 01:57:02.515]  They know nobody would believe Biden for a second time.
[01:57:02.955 --> 01:57:04.876]  That's why they deep-sixed Biden, as we predicted.
[01:57:05.656 --> 01:57:07.397]  So now James Carville has come out.
[01:57:07.477 --> 01:57:08.678]  She's going to get slaughtered.
[01:57:08.758 --> 01:57:11.779]  James Carville warns that Kamala Harris' horrible record
[01:57:13.049 --> 01:57:13.969]  We'll be exposed.
[01:57:14.589 --> 01:57:30.414]  Democrat political strategist James Carville warned his party that Kamala Harris' campaign will face an onslaught of political attacks exposing her record and past remarks that her campaign must be prepared for.
[01:57:31.937 --> 01:57:35.978]  The first 24 hours, President Harris campaigned to raise a record 81 million.
[01:57:36.018 --> 01:57:40.740]  Democrats have been significantly less enthusiastic about Biden than Republicans were about Trump until now.
[01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:47.442]  What is the key for the Vice President to sustain the excitement for a candidacy throughout the rest of the campaign?
[01:57:47.942 --> 01:57:51.864]  PBS Margaret Hoover asked Carbo last week on the show's firing line.
[01:57:53.544 --> 01:57:58.206]  But you have to understand, folks, that Kamala Harris
[01:57:59.511 --> 01:58:02.495]  Again, it's nothing but a complete and total puppet.
[01:58:10.071 --> 01:58:12.132]  Relieved that their candidate was no longer Joe Biden.
[01:58:12.552 --> 01:58:14.212]  That's the key question, Carville replied.
[01:58:14.632 --> 01:58:16.933]  And the first thing is to recognize what happened.
[01:58:17.413 --> 01:58:29.136]  What happened was the people wanted something different, and that she just projects the fact that she is, you know, excited about the future, and there was no policy that anyone was pushing, and there was no particular group that was behind it.
[01:58:29.516 --> 01:58:35.018]  It was just general feeling that people wanted a different choice than Donald Trump and Biden, and they got it.
[01:58:36.698 --> 01:58:39.259]  He goes on to say that her record is horrible.
[01:58:41.323 --> 01:58:43.004]  And they shouldn't be overconfident.
[01:58:44.406 --> 01:58:52.833]  So there's the little demon warning them to be aware of the fact that she's extremely unpopular and has a horrible record.
[01:58:55.635 --> 01:59:03.062]  But Kamala Harris and the actual policies that she stands for are beyond insane.
[01:59:06.721 --> 01:59:12.786]  Absolutely devastating if she gets her way and gets control of this country.
[01:59:12.806 --> 01:59:21.533]  Because the people who control her want to implode this nation and bring in absolute, total control over this country.
[01:59:21.553 --> 01:59:25.636]  And if you think things have been bad, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:59:25.656 --> 01:59:26.597]  I want to play SB1.
[01:59:26.677 --> 01:59:27.297]  O'Biden, Inc.
[01:59:27.717 --> 01:59:29.119]  must finish destroying the United States.
[01:59:30.139 --> 01:59:30.720]  John Bowne.
[01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:31.661]  Very important report.
[01:59:31.681 --> 01:59:32.001]  Here it is.
[01:59:36.072 --> 01:59:39.551]  But you know, I think it's time to finish the job here.
[01:59:40.672 --> 01:59:41.793]  I think it's time for us to.
[01:59:42.493 --> 01:59:44.894]  This motherfucker was a plant, Joe Biden.
[01:59:45.114 --> 01:59:46.295]  He was put into power.
[01:59:46.315 --> 01:59:53.959]  Illegally, he was then utilized to be the figurehead that was perceived to be incompetent to destroy our country.
[01:59:54.079 --> 02:00:00.182]  If you look at what he's done and you look at the damage that he's created, this man was put in power to do that damage.
[02:00:00.282 --> 02:00:04.824]  And then for all of us who say, oh, look, he's so dumb, he doesn't know what he's doing.
[02:00:04.904 --> 02:00:07.886]  There's nothing dumb about what these people are doing.
[02:00:07.926 --> 02:00:09.627]  The dumb motherfucker is Joe Biden.
[02:00:09.867 --> 02:00:12.069]  Have they had a competent leader in there?
[02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:14.271]  Let's say they had a Barack Obama.
[02:00:14.331 --> 02:00:17.073]  They would look at that guy and they would say, dude, that guy's a traitor.
[02:00:17.153 --> 02:00:21.316]  So they needed someone who looked incompetent to do what they've done.
[02:00:21.456 --> 02:00:28.002]  And that's another reason why they're pushing Kamala now, because the job isn't done, which coincidentally is their slogan.
[02:00:28.062 --> 02:00:29.183]  Let's finish the job.
[02:00:29.663 --> 02:00:31.184]  Our economic plan is working.
[02:00:31.825 --> 02:00:34.367]  We now have to finish the job when there's more to do.
[02:00:34.927 --> 02:00:35.588]  Biden was
[02:00:36.534 --> 02:00:37.635]  Stole the election 2020.
[02:00:38.036 --> 02:00:45.664]  We have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud
[02:00:47.363 --> 02:00:51.706]  This dude got his freaking work permit and social security card, came here illegally, got documented,
[02:01:11.943 --> 02:01:31.106]  Got on the buses from Texas to Chicago and now within four months this guy's got his social security card, he's got his worker's identification card for working, he's got a driver's license, he's got insurance, he just bought a car all in four months and has an efficiency apartment that he pays $500 a month for.
[02:01:32.367 --> 02:01:35.829]  Pennsylvania was registering non-citizens for 20 years, and they admit it!
[02:01:36.489 --> 02:01:37.870]  This is not subject to debate.
[02:01:38.370 --> 02:01:45.173]  And so then sticking with the topic of non-citizen voting, isn't it true that this November, non-citizens that reside in D.C.
[02:01:45.293 --> 02:01:48.574]  for simply 30 days can vote in D.C.
[02:01:48.694 --> 02:01:49.535]  municipal elections?
[02:01:50.095 --> 02:01:50.755]  That's correct.
[02:01:51.115 --> 02:01:51.936]  And D.C.
[02:01:52.196 --> 02:01:55.778]  also mails every registered voter a ballot, correct?
[02:01:55.918 --> 02:01:56.218]  Correct.
[02:01:56.838 --> 02:02:07.969]  And so, you're telling me that in Washington, D.C., if there is even a small clerical mistake, non-citizens could be mailed a ballot with federal races on them?
[02:02:08.529 --> 02:02:09.310]  That's correct.
[02:02:09.690 --> 02:02:12.693]  We found several other things using open source data.
[02:02:13.574 --> 02:02:16.116]  There is a gentleman named Eric Lutzen.
[02:02:17.998 --> 02:02:19.959]  He has matched up a list.
[02:02:19.999 --> 02:02:30.163]  He started looking at voters above the age of 80 that were registered for voting and did vote in Michigan.
[02:02:31.943 --> 02:02:37.886]  And 17,327 Michigan voters also had a corresponding obituary.
[02:02:38.066 --> 02:02:39.887]  They were on the voter rolls with the birth date of 1850.
[02:02:41.772 --> 02:02:47.560]  There were 232 people registered to vote with an address to our local prisons.
[02:02:47.581 --> 02:02:50.725]  There were 4,144 people that were 90 years old and older.
[02:02:55.782 --> 02:03:06.387]  There were 125 people registered to vote or on the voter rolls that were registered to, or their address comes back to, non-profit NGOs and different businesses.
[02:03:07.427 --> 02:03:11.909]  There were 300 people, approximately 300 people, with no first name, just a last name.
[02:03:14.210 --> 02:03:22.774]  There were about 110 people that were possible double voters, basically the same name, date of birth, address, but two different voter ID numbers.
[02:03:24.235 --> 02:03:27.976]  People registered to vote at various shelters and all that.
[02:03:29.516 --> 02:03:32.396]  We even found one person on the voter rolls by the name of Jesus Christ.
[02:03:32.937 --> 02:03:42.038]  And now they're finishing up organizing that, and they will move into high gear with all the things they believe will destabilize things and create enough fear to keep them in power.
[02:03:42.918 --> 02:03:52.880]  So they're going to strengthen the powers of the executive if they get their puppet in, but they are also preparing to strip powers and strip powers from the Supreme Court by packing the court and adding a whole bunch of new members.
[02:03:54.508 --> 02:03:57.730]  But they control, so they've got all these things pre-programmed ready.
[02:03:58.170 --> 02:04:04.894]  Yeah, well I think we've got all the Democrats who are ready for meaningful ethics reform to bind the Supreme Court.
[02:04:05.635 --> 02:04:08.576]  And we're working on changes to the Supreme Court.
[02:04:08.596 --> 02:04:15.921]  It can be term limits, it could be adding the number of justices, things we can do without having to have a constitutional amendment.
[02:04:16.361 --> 02:04:19.263]  Here is a man who's been a transformative president.
[02:04:19.303 --> 02:04:20.964]  He's got an enormous amount done.
[02:04:21.644 --> 02:04:25.107]  And yet he has stepped away, and he has passed the torch.
[02:04:25.648 --> 02:04:29.971]  And when they're ready to deliver the meal of tyranny, they pull out the meal and they serve the poisoned feast.
[02:04:30.872 --> 02:04:41.321]  So we're now into day two of the Olympics, and they're doing public satanic rituals with half-naked men, genitals hanging out, with children gyrating on them, blaspheming the Last Supper of Christ.
[02:04:41.341 --> 02:04:42.202]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[02:04:42.702 --> 02:04:45.343]  They're trying to censor it, trying to block it now after they put it out worldwide.
[02:04:45.823 --> 02:04:49.445]  But let's talk about the curse, like Sodom and Gomorrah, that Paris is under.
[02:04:49.465 --> 02:04:54.367]  The true Paris syndrome of the true shithole, hellhole city it is.
[02:04:54.967 --> 02:04:58.109]  They're a river full of feces with the swimmers swimming in it.
[02:04:59.229 --> 02:05:02.071]  Fires everywhere, all over the place.
[02:05:02.451 --> 02:05:06.492]  Massive power outages, in some cases city-wide.
[02:05:07.333 --> 02:05:09.114]  I mean, this is a hellish
[02:05:10.134 --> 02:05:19.483]  Hellish experience, fire bombings of trains and their railways and people paying massive amounts of money to be part of this spectacle.
[02:05:21.325 --> 02:05:26.390]  This is what you see in the final days of a collapsed civilization, every time in history.
[02:05:27.051 --> 02:05:29.734]  As we enter the fourth turning, it's happening right now.
[02:05:30.819 --> 02:05:40.682]  Burning buildings, burning train yards, people swimming in feces, just Satanism and pedophilic demonstrations everywhere.
[02:05:43.463 --> 02:05:46.144]  The wages of sin or death, serving Satan is for losers.
[02:05:46.564 --> 02:05:47.805]  We're going to the report right now.
[02:05:48.205 --> 02:05:53.527]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:05:54.232 --> 02:05:58.155]  And this is a special Saturday emergency news bulletin.
[02:05:58.816 --> 02:06:09.063]  If you thought Dylan Mulvaney and the Bud Light fiasco that basically destroyed Anheuser-Busch was a big story, the Olympics is in full, total panic mode.
[02:06:09.504 --> 02:06:19.371]  After yesterday, at the official launch of the Olympics, they had a whole bunch of anti-Christian, blasphemous garbage that we're going to be going over.
[02:06:19.411 --> 02:06:20.272]  But here's the key.
[02:06:21.448 --> 02:06:38.312]  NBC that's running the Olympics and the Olympic Committee have filed hundreds of DMCA takedown orders on X and other platforms with the videos having hundreds of millions of views, some of them, showing what they put at the opening of the Olympics.
[02:06:39.113 --> 02:06:41.593]  Now, I was thinking about this.
[02:06:42.454 --> 02:06:46.135]  We could show you this footage and then have them try to take it down.
[02:06:46.395 --> 02:06:47.015]  It's fair use.
[02:06:47.035 --> 02:06:47.795]  We have a right to do it.
[02:06:48.712 --> 02:06:49.472]  It's a public event.
[02:06:49.752 --> 02:06:50.572]  We're giving commentary.
[02:06:50.953 --> 02:06:54.513]  But I don't want to show you what's in these videos.
[02:06:54.613 --> 02:06:57.994]  If you want to find them, despite them trying to remove them, everybody's re-uploading them.
[02:06:58.374 --> 02:07:00.975]  Go look at it for yourselves, but don't have any children in the room.
[02:07:01.735 --> 02:07:08.197]  Because we'll put still images of the wide shot up, but not close images.
[02:07:09.522 --> 02:07:14.146]  Because the reason they're really trying to censor this now is there was backlash.
[02:07:14.166 --> 02:07:17.289]  They thought they would just basically subliminally program everybody.
[02:07:17.309 --> 02:07:20.132]  We're going to walk through what the symbols and what all the iconography mean.
[02:07:20.932 --> 02:07:35.746]  But recreating Christ's Last Supper, and we got them side by side, we'll put on screen, with the opening ceremony with potentially over a billion people watching, they had a bunch of men dressed as women
[02:07:36.934 --> 02:07:56.001]  And a giant, fat, obese woman with multiple children taking the roles of Christ's disciples with Bacchus, the god of sex, orgies, debauchery, drug use, alcoholism, as the flesh that they basically eat.
[02:07:56.061 --> 02:07:58.562]  And when you get into real Satanism, it's all about
[02:07:59.747 --> 02:08:08.549]  Carrying out black masses or, or, uh, carrying out black Sabbaths where you take something holy and you inverse it and you reverse it.
[02:08:09.309 --> 02:08:15.571]  Classical satanic rituals going back thousands of years were doing things in the name of Christ, but reversing it.
[02:08:15.591 --> 02:08:18.892]  I'm not going to mention those things here, but it's terrible.
[02:08:18.932 --> 02:08:28.454]  But Black Rock and the big banks are all Disney putting billions in the last five years into what they call drag queen story time from Australia to Germany, to Canada, the U S to Mexico.
[02:08:29.298 --> 02:08:37.242]  And men dressed like demon clowns, and there's a great movie poster they put out, you know, countering this, you know, that fully exposes it.
[02:08:37.262 --> 02:08:38.403]  In fact, we'll put it back on screen.
[02:08:39.203 --> 02:08:47.847]  And literally, it's just a bunch of people dressed like demon clowns, men saying they're women, and then saying the image of a woman is a demon.
[02:08:49.268 --> 02:08:50.849]  So this is meant
[02:08:51.926 --> 02:08:55.709]  Satanically to disgrace God and to demoralize God's followers.
[02:08:56.710 --> 02:09:12.865]  And if you zoom in on the videos that I'm not going to show here, because it's just a good taste, it's pornographic, multiple men have their genitals hanging out in the wide shot video shot and their children gyrating
[02:09:14.226 --> 02:09:20.610]  You can't tell their little boys, little girls sexually dancing around like they're at a topless bar while this is happening.
[02:09:21.390 --> 02:09:22.751]  So it's about capturing our children.
[02:09:22.771 --> 02:09:24.452]  It's about showing them as trophies.
[02:09:24.472 --> 02:09:25.993]  It's about rubbing in your face.
[02:09:26.033 --> 02:09:27.214]  And we'd be here for five hours.
[02:09:28.274 --> 02:09:36.279]  If I showed you all the new rock and roll and hip hop and just all the music, it's all about Satanism, all about death, all about torture, all about murder.
[02:09:36.579 --> 02:09:37.800]  The Superbowl has it.
[02:09:39.621 --> 02:09:40.262]  It's everywhere.
[02:09:40.302 --> 02:09:41.863]  You can't get away from it.
[02:09:41.923 --> 02:09:43.604]  So Satan has come.
[02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:47.931]  Out of the closet in a big, big way.
[02:09:48.611 --> 02:09:52.791]  Because I'm not going to give them any excuse to say that it's their material.
[02:09:53.011 --> 02:09:54.432]  Again, it's totally covered under the law.
[02:09:54.852 --> 02:09:55.912]  It's totally fair use.
[02:09:55.932 --> 02:09:58.752]  We're commentating on something that's public, that's worldwide.
[02:09:58.772 --> 02:09:59.472]  We're giving analysis.
[02:09:59.492 --> 02:10:03.973]  But I'm not even going to give them what they want to put their fake takedown.
[02:10:04.013 --> 02:10:08.814]  Because I don't want to show you the men with their penises and testicles out with children humping them.
[02:10:09.494 --> 02:10:10.054]  I'm not going to.
[02:10:10.114 --> 02:10:13.095]  If you want to go on X, that's the one place you can still find some of it.
[02:10:13.115 --> 02:10:14.035]  They're taking it down everywhere else.
[02:10:14.997 --> 02:10:16.058]  That you can go look at it for yourself.
[02:10:16.859 --> 02:10:22.604]  But I posted more than 10 videos last night and this morning, and they took them all down on our ex account.
[02:10:22.664 --> 02:10:25.868]  And I just put links, so they took the videos down that I linked to.
[02:10:26.648 --> 02:10:33.355]  Because there was a major backlash, and they now, because people are paying attention, don't want you to see it, they thought they'd just slip it in.
[02:10:35.263 --> 02:10:36.443]  That's what they do over and over again.
[02:10:36.703 --> 02:10:58.667]  That's like during the COVID lockdowns, they thought it would sell everybody on working from home and eating the bugs and everything, but instead, parents for the first time were locked in the house with their kids for over a year and a half in places like Australia, six months here in the U.S., and they got to see what was being taught by the schools, and it's everything you see going on at the Olympics.
[02:10:58.687 --> 02:10:59.407]  So that's the key.
[02:11:00.187 --> 02:11:04.168]  This is a test by the ESG Global Corporate Credit Score.
[02:11:05.543 --> 02:11:15.007]  The social credit score, we're starting with corporations first and passing down to the people to see if they will carry out outrageous orders.
[02:11:15.607 --> 02:11:19.228]  So you wonder why it's in the music, it's in the culture, it's in the movies, it's in the sports.
[02:11:20.529 --> 02:11:30.973]  And it's admitted by Larry Fink and BlackRock that controls over 80% of world assets that they don't give funds and don't give loans to corporations and companies unless they do it.
[02:11:31.273 --> 02:11:32.814]  So you wonder why tractors supply
[02:11:34.099 --> 02:11:37.261]  Is promoting all this, or why Harley Davidson is.
[02:11:38.262 --> 02:11:43.565]  Literal drag queen, fat men dressed up like demons with kids humping on them, or them humping on kids.
[02:11:44.165 --> 02:11:44.926]  Why are they doing it?
[02:11:45.666 --> 02:11:48.288]  Why is almost every major corporation, why is Bud Light doing this?
[02:11:49.569 --> 02:11:52.771]  Because they get financed and they get supported if they do.
[02:11:53.831 --> 02:12:01.256]  But when the backlash is too big, they expect some backlash, but when the backlash is ultra, ultra massive, they pull back.
[02:12:02.622 --> 02:12:08.045]  And they try to then censor what they put out on broadcast television to billions of people worldwide.
[02:12:09.566 --> 02:12:10.706]  And now they don't want you to see it.
[02:12:10.827 --> 02:12:16.610]  And again, I've now seen five of the events that they had, because I don't even watch Columbus anymore.
[02:12:16.650 --> 02:12:17.990]  It's always been globalist for decades.
[02:12:18.791 --> 02:12:20.652]  And I sat there last night, this morning and watched it.
[02:12:21.092 --> 02:12:31.158]  And it is hardcore, not just the desecration of Christians and the attack on Christians that we see in the
[02:12:32.702 --> 02:12:44.851]  Recreation in a demonic fashion of the Last Supper of Christ, where now the body of Christ is Bacchus, the demon god, and children are all gyrating around sexually while men's genitals hang out.
[02:12:45.231 --> 02:12:46.632]  This is on live TV in the world.
[02:12:47.773 --> 02:12:51.835]  I mean, if you zoom in, you'll see it, but I'm not pushing you to do it.
[02:12:51.855 --> 02:12:55.338]  Multiple people have their genitals hanging out in this particular video.
[02:12:56.710 --> 02:12:59.653]  And again, children simulated humping on them, simulated sex.
[02:13:00.133 --> 02:13:02.855]  And so it's called lesser magic.
[02:13:02.875 --> 02:13:08.500]  If they can do a simulation in front of you, the Satanists, the occultists believe that then it will be manifest in the real world.
[02:13:08.841 --> 02:13:10.742]  So this is their coming out of the closet.
[02:13:10.782 --> 02:13:13.284]  This is their pedophilic, satanic ritual.
[02:13:14.666 --> 02:13:17.848]  Like they do at Bohemian Grove secretly doing mock human sacrifices of children.
[02:13:17.868 --> 02:13:19.310]  And like they do at Skull and Bones.
[02:13:20.411 --> 02:13:24.114]  We got incredible footage with our sources out of Bohemian Grove just a week and a half ago.
[02:13:25.433 --> 02:13:28.615]  That's what all of this is really about.
[02:13:30.736 --> 02:13:39.220]  And again, they're trying to program you subconsciously, but when you're conscious of it and it backfires, then they try to pull it.
[02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:41.201]  So what they're doing is totally illegal.
[02:13:42.281 --> 02:13:45.243]  Elon Musk has now unfollowed the Olympics and criticized them for this.
[02:13:45.263 --> 02:13:47.924]  That's a good thing he's done, but it's very, very important.
[02:13:48.924 --> 02:13:51.906]  So here are some of the screenshots I've done of this.
[02:13:53.263 --> 02:13:59.386]  Olympic crackdown, Mario Nafal, one of the top X-Spaces guys, tens of millions of views a day.
[02:13:59.866 --> 02:14:01.647]  He got DMC takedown orders.
[02:14:01.687 --> 02:14:04.409]  They took all his videos down, almost shut his channel down.
[02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:07.070]  That's what they're doing.
[02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:14.794]  And again, here's just blow-ups of the children that later gyrate and are being humped on by men with their genitals hanging out on international television.
[02:14:14.814 --> 02:14:20.837]  Of course, you have earlier Olympics 2012, where Grim Reaper comes down with vaccines to kill the kids.
[02:14:22.188 --> 02:14:24.570]  We've got other Olympic deals with the drag queens.
[02:14:24.590 --> 02:14:25.771]  It's just, it's all drag queens.
[02:14:26.531 --> 02:14:28.212]  Uh, there's a screenshot of someone I'm talking about.
[02:14:28.232 --> 02:14:34.637]  And of course you got Marina Baranovich, who's the main ambassador of the Ukrainian children.
[02:14:34.657 --> 02:14:37.379]  There's the head Alexa Crowley, Black Magic Witch worldwide.
[02:14:37.399 --> 02:14:39.120]  Just look into her and the spirit cooking.
[02:14:40.532 --> 02:14:46.314]  He got Snoop Dogg with his Bath-O-Mat necklace and they're all, the Rothschilds, they're all wearing Bath-O-Mat necklaces.
[02:14:46.354 --> 02:14:50.776]  He's at the Olympics, he's in the Olympic outfit right there, all wearing Bath-O-Mat.
[02:14:50.796 --> 02:14:52.816]  They're letting you know what club they're in.
[02:14:53.076 --> 02:14:54.237]  He's not in the Crips anymore.
[02:14:55.228 --> 02:14:57.390]  He's in the Batman Devil Club.
[02:14:57.830 --> 02:15:00.232]  They've got other opening ceremonies where the U.S.
[02:15:00.292 --> 02:15:06.797]  is destroyed, the Statue of Liberty is all devastated, and folks are getting really, really, really, really upset about that, and they should.
[02:15:06.817 --> 02:15:12.702]  Of course, you've got Disney financially collapsing because of all their woke programming and hiring known pedophiles and just all of it.
[02:15:13.883 --> 02:15:17.686]  But this image right here illustrates it all.
[02:15:18.066 --> 02:15:22.309]  I've reposted this on X. I hope you share it.
[02:15:22.329 --> 02:15:24.091]  This is not an official.
[02:15:25.942 --> 02:15:28.665]  This is a meme, making fun of him, but it's serious.
[02:15:29.125 --> 02:15:29.946]  Paris 2024.
[02:15:30.466 --> 02:15:31.728]  And let's close out with this.
[02:15:33.365 --> 02:15:34.346]  What else is going on?
[02:15:34.847 --> 02:15:40.893]  Oh, anybody trying to wear a Christian cross or trying to bring their own Christian images in, they're all barred.
[02:15:41.273 --> 02:15:44.136]  But if it's pedophilic, if it's satanic, if it's demonic, you can.
[02:15:44.156 --> 02:15:47.940]  The opening ceremony was the only anti-Christian message sent by the World Olympic Committee.
[02:15:48.401 --> 02:15:56.009]  Two weeks before the Games, Brazilian surfer was ordered to remove images of Jesus Christ from a surfboard or be banned from the competition.
[02:15:57.566 --> 02:15:58.768]  And I haven't shown you the videos.
[02:15:58.828 --> 02:16:01.853]  I mean, it's like men rampaging around, humping on kids.
[02:16:02.475 --> 02:16:03.136]  I mean, it is.
[02:16:03.336 --> 02:16:03.877]  It is incredible.
[02:16:04.358 --> 02:16:06.181]  But again, it's on record.
[02:16:06.221 --> 02:16:06.802]  They've done this.
[02:16:07.984 --> 02:16:09.026]  They have been caught.
[02:16:10.211 --> 02:16:15.233]  And they think you're stupid and hope you just, you know, get upset this time, but next time you won't be as upset.
[02:16:15.293 --> 02:16:16.954]  No, we're upset.
[02:16:16.994 --> 02:16:18.215]  We know you're coming for our children.
[02:16:18.495 --> 02:16:19.575]  They're the entire future.
[02:16:19.635 --> 02:16:20.836]  Satan wants to destroy free will.
[02:16:20.856 --> 02:16:25.258]  He doesn't want children to be brought up normally and go through the regular rites of passage and make their own decisions.
[02:16:25.698 --> 02:16:27.719]  He wants to get them early so he can destroy their free will.
[02:16:28.179 --> 02:16:36.323]  And Christ said, if you hurt a child or a handicapped person, someone that isn't a full capacity, suffer the children.
[02:16:37.389 --> 02:16:44.794]  It'd be better for you to tie a giant millstone around your neck, and that was the old giant millstones that weighed like 3,000 pounds, and throw yourself in the deepest ocean.
[02:16:44.814 --> 02:16:52.580]  Better for you to kill yourself than to hurt one of these, because what you've done to them, you have done to me.
[02:16:53.401 --> 02:16:56.463]  The Bible tells us that Satan is the god of this world.
[02:16:56.543 --> 02:16:57.964]  He was given dominion over the world.
[02:16:58.464 --> 02:16:59.865]  I'm gonna explain that in another video coming up.
[02:17:00.266 --> 02:17:02.727]  Doesn't mean he's God, but he was given jurisdiction.
[02:17:02.747 --> 02:17:04.689]  That's why he took Christ up off a mountain and said,
[02:17:05.578 --> 02:17:08.060]  You know, just worship me and I'll give you full control of the planet.
[02:17:08.941 --> 02:17:11.884]  Christ said, my kingdom is not of this world.
[02:17:13.505 --> 02:17:15.707]  And of course we will get dominion when Christ returns.
[02:17:15.747 --> 02:17:18.149]  But as for now, you know, the antichrist is coming.
[02:17:18.609 --> 02:17:20.271]  This place is run by the devil.
[02:17:21.452 --> 02:17:27.637]  And that's why these people get on their knees and worship it and go along with it because they're given power from the beast.
[02:17:29.139 --> 02:17:29.279]  So,
[02:17:31.994 --> 02:17:33.514]  Let them try to take this video down.
[02:17:33.534 --> 02:17:34.314]  They'll probably try.
[02:17:34.334 --> 02:17:36.255]  And it shows how scared they are.
[02:17:36.535 --> 02:17:38.775]  So while it's still up, be sure and save it.
[02:17:39.135 --> 02:17:40.356]  Now, I'm up here on Saturday evening.
[02:17:40.376 --> 02:17:43.016]  I was going to take off today, but I had to come in because it's so important.
[02:17:43.316 --> 02:17:45.257]  I've got two more big reports coming up.
[02:17:45.297 --> 02:17:47.717]  So watch Real Alex Jones on X and Band.Video.
[02:17:48.137 --> 02:17:56.459]  And I will do a review in the next few days with the full rituals in HD up on Band.Video via Fair Use, analyzing it.
[02:17:56.479 --> 02:17:57.359]  They won't be able to stop us there.
[02:17:58.373 --> 02:18:00.515]  Because these are fake copyright claims.
[02:18:00.735 --> 02:18:03.057]  They get defeated, but they're meant to shut folks down.
[02:18:03.357 --> 02:18:10.763]  They don't want you to see what they did in front of the world, because you did see with the eyes the Holy Spirit had given you, and it didn't work.
[02:18:10.903 --> 02:18:13.945]  And that's why they are so upset, because they don't want you to protect the children.
[02:18:14.566 --> 02:18:15.526]  Thank you so much for watching.
[02:18:15.887 --> 02:18:17.328]  Follow me on X at Reliance Jones.
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:24.624]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:18:25.104 --> 02:18:29.427]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[02:18:29.447 --> 02:18:30.948]  It's fun time!
[02:18:43.797 --> 02:18:49.851]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:18:50.252 --> 02:18:51.715]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:18:57.725 --> 02:19:03.809]  Whether it's the World Economic Forum, whether it's the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, whether it's Open Philanthropy and Dustin Moskowitz.
[02:19:03.849 --> 02:19:09.452]  We know that all of these organizations thought that they could bamboozle all of us.
[02:19:09.873 --> 02:19:14.616]  They thought that by putting fact-checkers on every post, we'd stop sharing posts.
[02:19:15.076 --> 02:19:18.999]  They thought by canceling people that we wouldn't actually listen to people's voices.
[02:19:19.099 --> 02:19:20.680]  But the bad news is for them,
[02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:22.561]  We continue to do it.
[02:19:22.942 --> 02:19:24.764]  So what are the simple things that you can do?
[02:19:25.125 --> 02:19:31.172]  The simple things you can do, like I said before, support the alternative platforms that are allowing these voices to be heard.
[02:19:31.472 --> 02:19:33.955]  Make sure that you actually have these conversations.
[02:19:34.096 --> 02:19:38.962]  Without the utility of this voice and this platform, we will lose the war.
[02:19:39.382 --> 02:19:40.764]  So our job is really simple.
[02:19:41.184 --> 02:19:41.705]  Share this.
[02:19:41.785 --> 02:19:42.526]  Communicate this.

[02:19:56.719 --> 02:19:59.102]  I said, well, Satan is the god of this world.
[02:20:01.684 --> 02:20:02.325]  And man...
[02:20:03.268 --> 02:20:08.814]  Tens of thousands of comments and I'd say 23% of people saying, you love the devil.
[02:20:08.874 --> 02:20:10.636]  You're saying the devil's God.
[02:20:11.397 --> 02:20:12.939]  You are a Satanist.
[02:20:12.979 --> 02:20:14.781]  Well, you guys haven't cracked a Bible.
[02:20:15.282 --> 02:20:20.468]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:20:21.108 --> 02:20:24.032]  The world has been outraged and
[02:20:25.987 --> 02:20:30.909]  Just absolutely disgusted by what we've seen in the last 48 hours in Paris.
[02:20:31.169 --> 02:20:38.811]  Rivers of feces with swimmers in it, burning buildings, massive power outages, train stations being burned down.
[02:20:39.832 --> 02:20:43.473]  It's like an image of hell for the medieval painter Hieronymus Bosch.
[02:20:44.873 --> 02:20:52.396]  And then they had all these satanic ceremonies, blaspheming the Last Supper of Christ with men's genitals hanging out, humping children.
[02:20:54.008 --> 02:21:00.453]  Now NBC and other global channels that carry the Olympics are trying to block it and trying to not let us show it to you.
[02:21:00.493 --> 02:21:01.313]  You can go see it if you want.
[02:21:01.694 --> 02:21:02.915]  It's, it's, it's pornographic.
[02:21:02.955 --> 02:21:03.795]  It's, it's, it's pure evil.
[02:21:03.835 --> 02:21:04.416]  It's satanic.
[02:21:05.677 --> 02:21:06.557]  It's a black mass.
[02:21:07.638 --> 02:21:15.364]  What I want to talk about here is something I said that's now got over a million people that have read it on X this morning at Real Alex Jones.
[02:21:15.964 --> 02:21:18.066]  When I posted one of these videos, they've since removed.
[02:21:18.707 --> 02:21:22.890]  They're trying to hide it because the public got awake like Bud Light, but on steroids.
[02:21:24.255 --> 02:21:26.596]  I said, well, Satan is the God of this world.
[02:21:29.217 --> 02:21:36.360]  And man, tens of thousands of comments, and I'd say 23% of people saying, you love the devil.
[02:21:36.420 --> 02:21:38.180]  You're saying the devil's God.
[02:21:38.940 --> 02:21:40.481]  You are a Satanist.
[02:21:40.521 --> 02:21:42.342]  Well, you guys haven't cracked a Bible.
[02:21:42.942 --> 02:21:47.044]  So I used to go to church when I was growing up, like three times a week.
[02:21:47.064 --> 02:21:53.306]  We went to Methodist, we went to Evangelistic, and we also went to Southern Baptist.
[02:21:54.505 --> 02:22:00.500]  So I've gone to like multi-week long Bible colleges when I was a little kid over and over again, but I don't think I'd be a preacher.
[02:22:01.610 --> 02:22:07.151]  But what I can do is point you to the Bible itself and any version you want to read.
[02:22:07.211 --> 02:22:08.371]  This is so clear.
[02:22:08.772 --> 02:22:13.513]  And the reason it's so important is whether you believe in God or not, God believes in you.
[02:22:13.553 --> 02:22:15.853]  Whether you believe in Satan or not, God believes in you.
[02:22:15.933 --> 02:22:17.033]  And good and evil is real.
[02:22:17.113 --> 02:22:21.174]  And the devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[02:22:21.194 --> 02:22:29.896]  But you look at the Super Bowl and all the movies and TV shows and the hip hop and the rap, it's open Satanism and pedophilia.
[02:22:31.425 --> 02:22:37.028]  And targeting the children, and when you look at these rituals, you know what you're watching, it is even more satanic.
[02:22:37.088 --> 02:22:46.294]  So, I'm going to give you the Bible here, and you can deal with the Bible, and if you want to say it's satanic, and if you want to say it's of the devil, then that's your issue.
[02:22:46.754 --> 02:22:54.238]  So, I'm no theologian, I don't have a degree in that, but I immediately just said, well, the God of this world, what do you expect?
[02:22:54.259 --> 02:22:56.520]  So I'm going to explain how this happened.
[02:22:58.934 --> 02:23:03.540]  In the Christian historical compendium that we now see being fulfilled in front of the world.
[02:23:03.761 --> 02:23:05.142]  But the first thing I want to say is this.
[02:23:06.584 --> 02:23:11.245]  The globalists are pushing a classically anti-human, anti-God, satanic agenda.
[02:23:11.285 --> 02:23:18.106]  Black Rock controls over 80% of the world's resources and finances and money, is funding these satanic rituals everywhere.
[02:23:18.406 --> 02:23:24.527]  It's not happening when you tune into the Super Bowl or the World Cup or the Olympics by accident.
[02:23:25.007 --> 02:23:26.388]  They are paying for this.
[02:23:26.768 --> 02:23:33.509]  They are financing fat men dressed as women or demon clowns humping on kids from Australia to the United States.
[02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:35.871]  From the UK to Germany.
[02:23:36.311 --> 02:23:38.394]  From Canada to France.
[02:23:39.795 --> 02:23:46.583]  And this is all about destroying the family, selling you on accepting degeneracy because they can get away with anything they want.
[02:23:47.685 --> 02:23:53.408]  And through the BlackRock ESG corporate governance, they literally pay companies and give them better financing if they do this.
[02:23:53.708 --> 02:23:59.711]  So you wonder why Harley-Davidson and Trader Supply are the latest controversies, or Anheuser-Busch and Bud Light do this.
[02:24:00.852 --> 02:24:02.453]  It's because it's a corporate governance.
[02:24:02.473 --> 02:24:08.055]  They're told, we will control your behavior, you will put this image, this message out, or you don't get financing.
[02:24:08.075 --> 02:24:11.157]  So here's my post on X. Satan's the god of this world.
[02:24:12.731 --> 02:24:23.019]  Now, you can ask GPT this, or you can just simply go type in these verses into online Bibles, or go get a Bible to store, and read this for yourself.
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:26.662]  Dozens of quotes about Satan giving dominion over the earth.
[02:24:27.523 --> 02:24:30.105]  He offers Christ full control of the earth, that he serves him.
[02:24:30.145 --> 02:24:31.986]  Christ says, My kingdom is not of this earth.
[02:24:34.308 --> 02:24:37.290]  There's hundreds of these, but I'm only going to read about 30 or so, okay?
[02:24:37.571 --> 02:24:39.052]  And then you deal with the Scripture,
[02:24:40.205 --> 02:24:41.966]  And then ask yourself, is it not happening?
[02:24:42.907 --> 02:24:47.349]  2,000 years ago, Revelation, world government, castle society, you must worship the beast.
[02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:49.211]  You must serve it, not just take the mark.
[02:24:49.471 --> 02:24:57.216]  You worship it and follow its orders, and then you get the mark because you are a faithful servant of the devil.
[02:24:57.276 --> 02:24:58.917]  So I'm just going to start with the quotes.
[02:24:58.937 --> 02:25:00.197]  They get more powerful as we go.
[02:25:01.118 --> 02:25:01.658]  Listen to this.
[02:25:01.678 --> 02:25:02.519]  It's on Alex Jones.
[02:25:02.679 --> 02:25:03.640]  It's the Holy Bible.
[02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:04.060]  Here it is.
[02:25:05.270 --> 02:25:08.471]  This is what ChatGPT spit out in a 10-second question.
[02:25:08.792 --> 02:25:13.954]  Here are the Bible verses that imply Satan's influence or domination over the world in the King James Version.
[02:25:14.254 --> 02:25:16.655]  You can do it under any Bible you want, Catholic Bible, any of it.
[02:25:17.295 --> 02:25:17.696]  Corinthians 4.4.
[02:25:19.668 --> 02:25:29.811]  "...in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."
[02:25:29.831 --> 02:25:32.792]  I noticed commenters were saying, oh, they mean God's the God of this world.
[02:25:33.072 --> 02:25:36.493]  No, it says the devil's blinding people against Christ.
[02:25:37.073 --> 02:25:37.473]  Boom!
[02:25:39.374 --> 02:25:42.655]  John 12 31, "...now is the judgment of this world.
[02:25:42.775 --> 02:25:45.436]  Now shall the prince of this world be cast out."
[02:25:46.718 --> 02:25:51.121]  I'm going to go back to the Old Testament moment where it says Satan was given dominion after the Garden of Eden.
[02:25:51.501 --> 02:26:04.048]  Ephesians 2.2, Where in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, unto the devil, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit, that now worketh on the children of disobedience.
[02:26:04.409 --> 02:26:05.169]  You see it everywhere.
[02:26:05.189 --> 02:26:14.155]  1 John 5.19, And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.
[02:26:14.195 --> 02:26:16.056]  The whole world is in the hands of the wicked one.
[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:17.602]  That means dominance.
[02:26:18.364 --> 02:26:18.544]  John 14, 30.
[02:26:27.375 --> 02:26:27.715]  John 16, 11.
[02:26:28.776 --> 02:26:31.597]  O judgment, because the prince of the world is judged.
[02:26:32.057 --> 02:26:32.538]  Revelation 12, 9.
[02:26:33.438 --> 02:26:35.039]  And the great dragon was cast out.
[02:26:35.259 --> 02:26:39.401]  The old serpent called the devil and Satan, which deceived the whole world.
[02:26:39.461 --> 02:26:40.161]  The whole world!
[02:26:40.582 --> 02:26:42.903]  And he was cast out of the earth.
[02:26:42.923 --> 02:26:44.544]  This is in Revelation, coming in the future.
[02:26:44.924 --> 02:26:46.745]  And his angels were cast out with him.
[02:26:48.413 --> 02:26:50.994]  Luke 4, 5, 6, and this is the key one.
[02:26:51.014 --> 02:26:51.874]  Now listen to me carefully.
[02:26:52.095 --> 02:27:02.679]  Luke 4, 5, 6, and the devil taking him up to the high mountain, that's Christ, showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
[02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:10.442]  And the devil said unto him, Christ, all the power will I give you.
[02:27:10.462 --> 02:27:11.723]  Well, how does he give him all the power?
[02:27:11.803 --> 02:27:12.303]  He has it.
[02:27:14.249 --> 02:27:24.413]  So the devil said unto him, All the power I will give thee, and the glory of them, for that is delivered unto me, and for whosoever I will, I give it.
[02:27:25.013 --> 02:27:26.094]  He has dominion over the earth.
[02:27:26.114 --> 02:27:27.294]  You're like, well, that's the devil saying that.
[02:27:27.855 --> 02:27:31.076]  Oh, well, let's read to you what God said in Genesis.
[02:27:31.176 --> 02:27:31.756]  Hmm.
[02:27:32.957 --> 02:27:33.817]  Oh, yeah.
[02:27:34.717 --> 02:27:35.618]  Let's continue a little bit more.
[02:27:37.079 --> 02:27:41.600]  This is the verse where Jesus says, My kingdom is not of this world, is found in John 18, 36.
[02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:44.800]  Here it is in the King James Version.
[02:27:45.961 --> 02:27:49.281]  Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world.
[02:27:49.321 --> 02:27:50.061]  Well, wait, wait, wait.
[02:27:50.682 --> 02:27:51.722]  I thought he's in charge.
[02:27:52.902 --> 02:28:03.764]  If my kingdom was of this world, then would my servants find that I should not be delivered to the Jews, but now is my kingdom not from hence.
[02:28:07.168 --> 02:28:09.349]  And that's for us to accept Christ, and then he comes.
[02:28:10.569 --> 02:28:19.492]  Ephesians 6.12, For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this world.
[02:28:19.732 --> 02:28:22.393]  The rulers of darkness of this world!
[02:28:22.613 --> 02:28:24.314]  The rulers of darkness rule the world!
[02:28:24.474 --> 02:28:25.934]  The rulers of darkness rule the world!
[02:28:26.074 --> 02:28:27.355]  The rulers of darkness rule the world!
[02:28:27.515 --> 02:28:28.715]  The rulers of darkness rule the world!
[02:28:29.175 --> 02:28:30.316]  The rulers of darkness rule the world!
[02:28:32.176 --> 02:28:33.797]  The world government is satanic!
[02:28:33.877 --> 02:28:34.557]  It's everywhere!
[02:28:36.980 --> 02:28:44.464]  Now, let's go back to the Old Testament, because Christ said, I do not come to erase all of this before me, but to fulfill it.
[02:28:49.487 --> 02:28:51.128]  Genesis 1, 26, 28.
[02:28:52.368 --> 02:28:53.409]  King James Version.
[02:28:53.469 --> 02:28:54.769]  It's the same in all the versions.
[02:28:54.890 --> 02:28:55.430]  Go look it up.
[02:28:55.810 --> 02:28:58.551]  A five-year-old can understand this.
[02:28:58.571 --> 02:28:58.551]  26.
[02:28:58.932 --> 02:29:01.233]  And God said, let us make man in our image.
[02:29:03.419 --> 02:29:14.427]  In our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over the earth, and every other creeping thing creeping upon the earth.
[02:29:14.467 --> 02:29:17.169]  What's W-E-F want to take control of?
[02:29:19.090 --> 02:29:19.671]  Everything we have.
[02:29:19.691 --> 02:29:19.671]  27.
[02:29:21.632 --> 02:29:25.735]  So God created man in his own image, and the image of God created him.
[02:29:26.866 --> 02:29:28.688]  Male and female created he them.
[02:29:28.708 --> 02:29:28.688]  28.
[02:29:30.049 --> 02:29:43.703]  And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and the fowl of the air, and every other living thing that moveth upon it.
[02:29:44.624 --> 02:29:49.088]  But, see, God gave them perfect knowledge of goodness and how to operate purely.
[02:29:50.219 --> 02:29:53.981]  But they had free will, so they ate of the tree of knowledge with the serpent.
[02:29:54.482 --> 02:29:56.103]  Eve got Adam to eat.
[02:29:56.383 --> 02:30:00.946]  And God says, I am now taking dominion from you and giving it to the serpent.
[02:30:01.206 --> 02:30:07.690]  And I'm going to throw you into the wilderness and make you go through all this pain because I gave you utopia, but I had to give you free will.
[02:30:07.730 --> 02:30:08.550]  You're a free creature.
[02:30:08.890 --> 02:30:09.751]  You did not take it.
[02:30:10.031 --> 02:30:12.753]  And so now Satan is given dominion over the earth.
[02:30:13.753 --> 02:30:16.015]  Now you can ignore Jesus and Paul and all of my friends.
[02:30:16.195 --> 02:30:16.635]  That's fine.
[02:30:17.776 --> 02:30:19.657]  But this is God speaking.
[02:30:21.772 --> 02:30:35.286]  Genesis 3, 17, 19, And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of my wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of the cursed tree.
[02:30:37.833 --> 02:30:42.978]  Ground for thy sake, in sorrow thou shalt eat of all the days of thy life.
[02:30:43.718 --> 02:30:52.366]  So now that you love evil, now that you tasted of it and all the scams and all the fraud, in sorrow shall they eat of it all the days of your life.
[02:30:52.426 --> 02:30:54.748]  It's a mind virus that Elon Musk talks about.
[02:30:55.068 --> 02:30:55.669]  It's all here.
[02:30:57.537 --> 02:30:59.358]  The average atheist reads it as gibberish.
[02:30:59.418 --> 02:31:00.258]  It's all come true.
[02:31:00.298 --> 02:31:04.720]  It's all completely, it's so quick and accurate and just dead on.
[02:31:04.740 --> 02:31:04.720]  18.
[02:31:05.521 --> 02:31:12.804]  Thorns also and thistles shall bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.
[02:31:12.824 --> 02:31:15.065]  Supposed to eat none but meat before that.
[02:31:16.308 --> 02:31:22.871]  19.
[02:31:16.789 --> 02:31:22.871]  In the sweet of thy face shall they eat bread, till thou return unto the ground.
[02:31:23.192 --> 02:31:28.594]  For thou of it wist thou taken, from dust thou art, and from dust thou shalt return.
[02:31:31.656 --> 02:31:32.696]  We're given dominion.
[02:31:32.736 --> 02:31:33.657]  It's all yours.
[02:31:33.717 --> 02:31:34.997]  You control the whole thing.
[02:31:35.318 --> 02:31:36.678]  You sell it out for nothing.
[02:31:39.880 --> 02:31:41.000]  And that's the Old Testament.
[02:31:42.621 --> 02:31:43.462]  And that's the first 4,000 years.
[02:31:46.078 --> 02:31:48.480]  And we enter into this new time and a new covenant.
[02:31:48.500 --> 02:31:54.325]  We have to accept the covenant, and we have to accept the blood of Jesus, and we have to overwrite the enemy operation.
[02:31:55.466 --> 02:31:57.528]  So, there you go.
[02:31:58.228 --> 02:32:00.971]  Is Satan the god of this world?
[02:32:01.111 --> 02:32:01.451]  Yes!
[02:32:02.052 --> 02:32:09.318]  Because we were given the deed, and we had free will as God's children, made in his image, and if your daddy gives you a house,
[02:32:10.919 --> 02:32:11.599]  You're the owner now.
[02:32:11.819 --> 02:32:19.340]  And if you want to go lose it in a poker game, or you want to go sell it for nothing, well, sorry, you were given your birthright.
[02:32:19.361 --> 02:32:21.401]  Like the prodigal son, you went and pissed it down a rat hole.
[02:32:22.801 --> 02:32:23.441]  That's all this is.
[02:32:24.181 --> 02:32:25.122]  We had dominion.
[02:32:25.422 --> 02:32:26.562]  We had full control.
[02:32:27.302 --> 02:32:28.162]  We sold it out.
[02:32:28.622 --> 02:32:31.743]  We dialed into scams and fraud and evil and the knowledge of evil.
[02:32:33.083 --> 02:32:38.944]  And now we are cursed unless we accept Christ and transmute that into the new covenant.
[02:32:40.697 --> 02:32:43.059]  Now, that's as clear as the nose of my face.
[02:32:43.319 --> 02:32:44.540]  Any idiot can understand it.
[02:32:45.100 --> 02:32:48.042]  And so, people are like, what do you mean the devil rules the earth?
[02:32:48.102 --> 02:32:49.103]  Have you looked around?
[02:32:50.624 --> 02:32:51.945]  Have you seen what's going on?
[02:32:55.607 --> 02:32:57.308]  Satan is the god of this world.
[02:32:57.348 --> 02:32:59.410]  Little g. The prince.
[02:33:01.871 --> 02:33:02.632]  He's the viceroy.
[02:33:04.048 --> 02:33:05.369]  And yeah, he's held back by God.
[02:33:05.389 --> 02:33:06.270]  The Bible's very clear.
[02:33:06.290 --> 02:33:07.570]  He's going to go up and get permission for things.
[02:33:07.891 --> 02:33:10.012]  And God says, well, they gave free will, go ahead and do it.
[02:33:10.312 --> 02:33:11.993]  People say, well, God's a sadist.
[02:33:12.033 --> 02:33:20.299]  No, God created entities, us, with free will, just like I have children and knowing I've had children, they could grow up and be bank robbers.
[02:33:20.319 --> 02:33:21.040]  I don't think they will.
[02:33:21.060 --> 02:33:21.740]  I've got great children.
[02:33:21.760 --> 02:33:22.120]  I'm blessed.
[02:33:22.140 --> 02:33:26.223]  But have I committed a crime getting with my wife and having children?
[02:33:26.283 --> 02:33:27.204]  No, I want children.
[02:33:27.264 --> 02:33:27.904]  I love children.
[02:33:27.924 --> 02:33:28.985]  I want to bring them up right.
[02:33:29.045 --> 02:33:29.806]  I'm not perfect though.
[02:33:29.826 --> 02:33:30.266]  Neither are they.
[02:33:32.156 --> 02:33:33.176]  So God had children.
[02:33:33.216 --> 02:33:33.956]  We are his children.
[02:33:33.976 --> 02:33:36.577]  This planet is his child, but we have free will.
[02:33:36.697 --> 02:33:40.858]  And so our free will manifest this entity that wants to go against God.
[02:33:41.098 --> 02:33:42.738]  And God says, fine, you have the license.
[02:33:42.758 --> 02:33:45.719]  Now go ahead until they finally figure out you're a piece of crap.
[02:33:47.379 --> 02:33:50.600]  So newsflash to all people that I guess don't go to church, but think they're Christians.
[02:33:51.380 --> 02:33:53.901]  The planet is run by an entity that wants to what?
[02:33:55.109 --> 02:34:00.664]  Kill, steal, and destroy because he's jealous of us because we're made in the image of God.
[02:34:00.985 --> 02:34:02.088]  Have you looked around?
[02:34:03.860 --> 02:34:06.721]  Could Satan create spaceships and computers and all that?
[02:34:06.761 --> 02:34:07.121]  No, no.
[02:34:07.621 --> 02:34:11.242]  Could Shakespeare create all the great literature and Beethoven?
[02:34:11.602 --> 02:34:11.782]  No.
[02:34:12.823 --> 02:34:18.724]  Satan is jealous of us because we're actually going to be way more powerful than he is under God's system.
[02:34:19.064 --> 02:34:24.306]  So he is simply trying to manipulate us and make us his slaves to build his empire.
[02:34:24.546 --> 02:34:26.547]  And God said, sure, I'll let you be the tester.
[02:34:26.767 --> 02:34:27.527]  I gave him free will.
[02:34:27.767 --> 02:34:28.527]  I love my children.
[02:34:28.547 --> 02:34:31.068]  I'm going to give him a cheat sheet, the Bible and Revelation.
[02:34:32.796 --> 02:34:34.638]  Because I'm not saying God cheats, but that's what it is.
[02:34:34.678 --> 02:34:40.823]  God's like, well, sure, devil, but I'll give him a little, little, little forecast.
[02:34:41.363 --> 02:34:42.304]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:34:42.324 --> 02:34:49.590]  God gives you free will, but he also comes in and says, I'm going to warn you.
[02:34:50.010 --> 02:34:53.393]  I'm going to tell you, just like a sign, you know, don't get too close to the cliff.
[02:34:55.395 --> 02:34:57.336]  Don't play with gasoline.
[02:34:58.097 --> 02:34:58.958]  Don't take fentanyl.
[02:35:01.317 --> 02:35:06.199]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen, and I appreciate you tuning in tonight.
[02:35:06.219 --> 02:35:08.640]  We'll have a great debate here on X about this.
[02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:10.501]  Attack me as the devil if you want.
[02:35:11.141 --> 02:35:16.463]  Satan is in control of the earth, but the time is short.
[02:35:16.783 --> 02:35:19.364]  The devil sends the beast of wrath because he knows the time is short.
[02:35:20.824 --> 02:35:22.825]  Let human understanding reckon the number of the beast. 666.
[02:35:26.139 --> 02:35:29.403]  Here's Blackrock and all of them bringing their system in.
[02:35:30.184 --> 02:35:37.733]  So notice I said Satan's a little G, not a real God, but he was able to calm God's children and giving him the deed.
[02:35:37.973 --> 02:35:42.399]  But Christ came to say, he went to get the keys to hell and death.
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:45.900]  But it's an individual decision.
[02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:49.421]  He's taking the planet back one person at a time.
[02:35:49.761 --> 02:35:50.581]  And that's how this works.
[02:35:51.081 --> 02:35:52.762]  Great job, the crew, coming in on Saturday evening.
[02:35:52.782 --> 02:35:54.002]  We're launching all this really late in the evening.
[02:35:54.242 --> 02:35:54.802]  This is all breaking.
[02:35:54.842 --> 02:35:56.302]  I just felt I had to come in and do it.
[02:35:56.623 --> 02:35:57.483]  Thank you for your support.
[02:35:57.683 --> 02:35:58.583]  Please share this everywhere.
[02:35:58.943 --> 02:36:00.223]  God bless and good luck.

[02:37:00.947 --> 02:37:04.710]  Auditory pareidolia is a known psychological
[02:37:30.865 --> 02:37:34.706]  All right, I'm gonna play a recording of people chanting, that is embarrassing, four times.
[02:37:34.726 --> 02:37:37.387]  After the fourth time, write down what you hear.

[02:38:21.355 --> 02:38:21.515]  Fascism
[02:38:23.612 --> 02:38:24.733]  Ha ha ha!
[02:38:40.646 --> 02:38:41.446]  It's freaky, isn't it?
[02:38:41.807 --> 02:38:44.888]  You heard the same thing every single time.
[02:38:45.629 --> 02:38:53.613]  Our eyes and ears take in electrical signals which our brains interpret based on our expectations.
[02:38:54.573 --> 02:38:55.654]  We don't see reality.
[02:38:56.511 --> 02:38:58.574]  We see our reality.
[02:38:58.754 --> 02:39:01.457]  So I saw the headline all over the news being pushed everywhere.
[02:39:02.098 --> 02:39:05.082]  President Trump said, I'm not a Christian.
[02:39:05.823 --> 02:39:12.211]  So I go to the video that the Democrat Party is posting everywhere, and he clearly says, and I'm a Christian.
[02:39:13.252 --> 02:39:13.853]  I'm a Christian.
[02:39:14.955 --> 02:39:17.337]  And it's barely distorted.
[02:39:17.377 --> 02:39:18.398]  He's talking fast.
[02:39:18.418 --> 02:39:19.558]  He's got a New York accent.
[02:39:19.598 --> 02:39:21.360]  But he's clearly saying it.
[02:39:21.380 --> 02:39:23.021]  He's said he's a Christian for decades.
[02:39:23.061 --> 02:39:24.882]  He's said, I need God to protect me.
[02:39:24.922 --> 02:39:25.883]  America needs God.
[02:39:26.183 --> 02:39:28.165]  We're in a fight between good versus evil.
[02:39:28.185 --> 02:39:31.927]  But here they are telling you, desperately, like they said J.D.
[02:39:31.967 --> 02:39:35.870]  Vance wrote in his bestselling book that he had sex with his couch.
[02:39:36.430 --> 02:39:37.891]  There's nothing about a couch in the book.
[02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:44.293]  But they let it run for four or five days and then AP and Reuters said it's fake.
[02:39:44.913 --> 02:39:45.974]  But it's already too late.
[02:39:46.074 --> 02:39:48.996]  It's out there that JD Vance is having sex with his couch.
[02:39:50.216 --> 02:39:52.157]  Remember how they said Trump hates all Mexicans?
[02:39:52.177 --> 02:39:53.358]  Never said anything close to it.
[02:39:53.738 --> 02:39:55.559]  So there's a lot of good people coming across the border.
[02:39:55.879 --> 02:39:58.021]  Also a lot of really bad hombres.
[02:39:59.887 --> 02:40:01.348]  Is that all Mexicans are bad?
[02:40:01.468 --> 02:40:03.890]  No, he said a lot of bad hombres are also coming across.
[02:40:03.930 --> 02:40:05.211]  So this is how they do it.
[02:40:05.251 --> 02:40:11.996]  They put their lie out first, as the great Mark Twain said, a lie goes halfway around the world before truth puts its pants on.
[02:40:12.396 --> 02:40:13.517]  But in the end, truth wins.
[02:40:14.338 --> 02:40:17.320]  They are so desperate, and I can't even imagine what they're going to do next.
[02:40:17.340 --> 02:40:20.042]  I mean, we already heard Kamala Harris was never the border czar.
[02:40:20.062 --> 02:40:21.443]  Maybe that's her official title.
[02:40:22.103 --> 02:40:23.464]  Thousands of newscast stories.
[02:40:24.084 --> 02:40:27.786]  We heard she never bailed out rioters, even though she's all over TV bragging about it years ago.
[02:40:28.486 --> 02:40:30.207]  This is their desperation level.
[02:40:30.247 --> 02:40:34.910]  And so instead of dialing lies back because they've been caught, they're dialing lies up.
[02:40:34.970 --> 02:40:42.914]  So here is the official clip of Trump speaking at Turning Point Action yesterday.
[02:40:43.955 --> 02:40:46.236]  And here he says, I need Christians to vote.
[02:40:47.992 --> 02:40:49.913]  I'm a Christian, and they're also spinning it.
[02:40:50.213 --> 02:40:52.175]  Oh, he said, you only got to vote this time.
[02:40:52.195 --> 02:40:53.155]  You don't have to vote in the future.
[02:40:53.455 --> 02:40:54.096]  Well, he's a dictator.
[02:40:54.136 --> 02:40:56.057]  No, he's clearly, because I know Trump speak.
[02:40:57.017 --> 02:40:59.619]  He's clearly saying we're going to win and turn the country around so good.
[02:40:59.639 --> 02:41:00.599]  We'll be so popular.
[02:41:00.619 --> 02:41:01.980]  We won't be such a crisis.
[02:41:02.020 --> 02:41:02.921]  But now is the time.
[02:41:03.421 --> 02:41:07.063]  But they're not focusing on that part as much as they're focusing on.
[02:41:08.444 --> 02:41:13.267]  The false claim that he says, I'm not a Christian, he says, and I'm a Christian and I'm a Christian.
[02:41:13.947 --> 02:41:16.429]  Here it is in regular speed and slow down.
[02:41:17.893 --> 02:41:20.760]  And again, Christians, get out and vote!
[02:41:21.181 --> 02:41:22.284]  Just this time!
[02:41:25.791 --> 02:41:27.491]  You won't have to do it anymore.
[02:41:27.591 --> 02:41:28.492]  Four more years.
[02:41:28.532 --> 02:41:29.072]  You know what?
[02:41:29.592 --> 02:41:30.432]  It'll be fixed.
[02:41:30.512 --> 02:41:31.412]  It'll be fine.
[02:41:32.052 --> 02:41:34.433]  You won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.
[02:41:34.513 --> 02:41:35.493]  I love you, Christians.
[02:41:35.573 --> 02:41:36.453]  I'm a Christian.
[02:41:36.913 --> 02:41:38.574]  I'm a Christian.
[02:41:39.634 --> 02:41:42.875]  I'm a Christian.
[02:41:43.815 --> 02:41:45.495]  I'm a Christian.
[02:41:45.935 --> 02:41:46.795]  I'm a Christian.
[02:41:47.235 --> 02:41:47.896]  I love you.
[02:41:47.976 --> 02:41:48.476]  Get out.
[02:41:48.576 --> 02:41:50.116]  You gotta get out and vote.
[02:41:50.576 --> 02:41:52.376]  In four years, you don't have to vote again.
[02:41:52.396 --> 02:41:54.557]  We'll have it fixed so good, you're not gonna have to vote.
[02:41:55.902 --> 02:41:57.583]  This guy was born in New York City.
[02:41:57.623 --> 02:41:58.903]  He talks like a New Yorker.
[02:41:59.523 --> 02:42:00.283]  I'm a Christian.
[02:42:00.323 --> 02:42:01.304]  You know, I'm a Christian.
[02:42:02.464 --> 02:42:05.385]  And he tries to cut his New York accent for the general public, but he's a New Yorker.
[02:42:05.665 --> 02:42:06.605]  Yeah, I'm a Christian.
[02:42:06.685 --> 02:42:07.505]  Yeah, I'm a Christian.
[02:42:08.366 --> 02:42:13.347]  But they sit there and didn't tell you that he said, I'm not a Christian.
[02:42:14.988 --> 02:42:17.849]  Back this video up on X. Watch it 50 times.
[02:42:18.349 --> 02:42:20.850]  Clearly, could he have said it a little clearer?
[02:42:21.130 --> 02:42:21.350]  Yeah.
[02:42:22.230 --> 02:42:23.710]  I'm a Christian.
[02:42:24.191 --> 02:42:25.411]  I believe in Jesus Christ.
[02:42:26.793 --> 02:42:28.134]  I'm born again, yes.
[02:42:28.514 --> 02:42:35.638]  But we've been telling Trump, you need to be very clear about this, he's been doing it at the RNC in Milwaukee last week, everywhere.
[02:42:36.519 --> 02:42:48.085]  He has been totally clear about this, and he got Roe v. Wade overturned, and he's standing up against the IRS persecuting Christians, and all the rest of it, you judge a tree by its fruit.
[02:42:48.125 --> 02:42:52.368]  So the satanic Democrat party that funds drag queen pedophile town everywhere,
[02:42:53.493 --> 02:43:01.537]  Is literally, it has Satanism taught in schools where they get away with it in different areas, literal Satanism classes, Satanism after school.
[02:43:02.137 --> 02:43:05.198]  These people are telling you now, no, no, no, this guy's not a Christian.
[02:43:05.799 --> 02:43:07.800]  Well, Trump has never claimed he's Jesus.
[02:43:07.840 --> 02:43:08.780]  He's never claimed he's a saint.
[02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:09.841]  He's never been a hypocrite.
[02:43:10.121 --> 02:43:13.242]  And people recognize that and know that, but they are so desperate.
[02:43:13.582 --> 02:43:15.803]  My question is, what are they going to pull next?
[02:43:15.863 --> 02:43:18.885]  I mean, literally thousands of different accounts.
[02:43:19.605 --> 02:43:21.066]  Have been posting all of this stuff.
[02:43:21.086 --> 02:43:26.529]  The Krasenstein, you know, all of them saying, oh no, Trump is saying he's not a Christian.
[02:43:26.869 --> 02:43:29.791]  They are so incredibly desperate right now.
[02:43:29.811 --> 02:43:31.912]  All right, that's it for this special report.
[02:43:31.952 --> 02:43:36.875]  More special Emergency Center reports coming up live at Real Alex Jones tonight.
[02:43:37.175 --> 02:43:39.436]  So please check for those and share those.
[02:43:39.717 --> 02:43:41.978]  That's how we override the censors and count other lies.
[02:43:45.148 --> 02:43:50.378]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:43:50.859 --> 02:43:55.046]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[02:44:17.005 --> 02:44:17.286]  I don't know.
[02:44:23.370 --> 02:44:36.575]  Well, people don't know, by the way, so, you know, and I'll say this again, that many moons ago, when I was just getting started in all of this, that I remember I used to come on with Alex in 2016 is when we started doing it.
[02:44:36.875 --> 02:44:38.395]  Met you at the RNC in Cleveland.
[02:44:38.415 --> 02:44:40.016]  We did the rally by the river.
[02:44:40.036 --> 02:44:40.476]  Yeah.
[02:44:41.056 --> 02:44:42.337]  With Roger and everyone's there.
[02:44:42.917 --> 02:44:44.358]  And Diamond and Silk were there.
[02:44:44.398 --> 02:44:44.978]  That was great.
[02:44:44.998 --> 02:44:50.220]  We're out here to spite all the threats and exercising your sacred First Amendment.
[02:44:50.300 --> 02:44:50.960]  We salute you!
[02:44:51.521 --> 02:44:55.015]  Jim Goldwater salutes you, and you are part of history.
[02:44:55.216 --> 02:44:56.100]  You are the future.
[02:44:56.240 --> 02:44:56.702]  God bless you.
[02:45:02.185 --> 02:45:06.387]  Back then, even before I was at One America, I used to host Hour 4.
[02:45:06.807 --> 02:45:07.307]  You remember that?
[02:45:07.487 --> 02:45:07.687]  Yeah.
[02:45:08.028 --> 02:45:10.449]  Yeah, and you'd be like, I didn't even know you back then!
[02:45:10.569 --> 02:45:13.550]  And you were, I was just some guy, and you were like, hey, your microphone's not good.
[02:45:13.570 --> 02:45:26.736]  So guys, Alex Jones sends me my first microphone that I've got set up in like a, uh, just like a spare bedroom in the house, and I'm doing it over my laptop, and he goes, oh yeah, yeah, I need someone to host Hour 4.
[02:45:26.816 --> 02:45:28.756]  So I'm like, get in there, just do it.
[02:45:28.776 --> 02:45:29.837]  He's like, what do you want me to talk about?
[02:45:30.077 --> 02:45:31.298]  As wherever you like, I gotta go.
[02:45:31.638 --> 02:45:34.601]  And I'm like, I'm just some, I'm just some guy at that point.
[02:45:34.621 --> 02:45:37.503]  You know, I had been through 2016 and we had met, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:45:37.523 --> 02:45:38.484]  No, but you were a smart guy.
[02:45:38.504 --> 02:45:45.249]  But it, but it, my point though, is that people don't realize how much Alex does behind the scenes to help people.
[02:45:45.530 --> 02:45:52.435]  People don't realize how much that Alex really is just, just generous with his time, generous with his resources.
[02:45:52.715 --> 02:45:53.436]  And that's a side.
[02:45:53.516 --> 02:45:56.158]  And, and by the way, spends time with your family.
[02:45:57.039 --> 02:46:07.448]  And, you know, something that I've always tried to say is, like, there's this media caricature of Alex Jones, and I'm like, that's not the guy that I've ever met.
[02:46:07.568 --> 02:46:08.549]  I've never met him.
[02:46:08.669 --> 02:46:09.970]  I've spent plenty of time with him.
[02:46:10.330 --> 02:46:11.851]  I've never met this guy.
[02:46:12.252 --> 02:46:13.433]  He sounds crazy.
[02:46:13.473 --> 02:46:17.596]  I don't know that I'd want to meet the guy that they take you out to be, because that's just not you.
[02:46:17.696 --> 02:46:24.522]  And so, I mean, I just want to take the opportunity real quick to just say thank you for all the help that you gave me when I was getting started.
[02:46:24.602 --> 02:46:30.305]  Well, thank you, Jack, but it wasn't because you were like, I was, you know, you were a talented, smart guy and we're making great points.
[02:46:30.345 --> 02:46:32.706]  I'm like, well, hey, you need to get on air and you need to do more.
[02:46:33.066 --> 02:46:33.786]  We're going to go to break.
[02:46:33.806 --> 02:46:34.607]  He's going to take over.
[02:46:34.627 --> 02:46:36.528]  I haven't plugged in three hours.
[02:46:36.588 --> 02:46:37.628]  If we don't do that, we'll be gone.
[02:46:37.648 --> 02:46:44.011]  Infowarsstore.com, big sale, Vitamineral Fusion back in stock, X2 back in stock.
[02:46:44.031 --> 02:46:44.671]  So pray for us.
[02:46:44.772 --> 02:46:47.593]  Infowarsstore.com, drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:46:47.613 --> 02:46:49.574]  My dad two years ago said they're going to shut you down.
[02:46:50.034 --> 02:46:50.555]  We're good to go.
[02:46:50.595 --> 02:46:51.115]  We're good to go.
[02:46:51.135 --> 02:46:51.656]  We're good to go.
[02:46:51.676 --> 02:46:52.637]  We're good to go.
[02:46:52.657 --> 02:46:53.158]  We're good to go.
[02:46:53.178 --> 02:46:54.299]  We're good to go.
[02:46:54.339 --> 02:46:54.800]  We're good to go.
[02:46:54.820 --> 02:46:56.322]  We're good to go.
[02:46:56.382 --> 02:46:57.103]  We're good to go.
[02:46:57.123 --> 02:46:57.764]  We're good to go.
[02:46:57.824 --> 02:46:58.625]  We're good to go.
[02:46:58.685 --> 02:46:59.686]  We're good to go.
[02:47:09.298 --> 02:47:12.840]  Alex, when you're working hard and you've got a bunch of back-to-back flights, what's good?
[02:47:12.860 --> 02:47:13.621]  What should I go for?
[02:47:13.681 --> 02:47:17.383]  These Seminoles are all so strong, I rarely take them, but they'll really work well.
[02:47:17.403 --> 02:47:17.743]  I take them all.
[02:47:28.930 --> 02:47:30.071]  I haven't taken any today.
[02:47:30.152 --> 02:47:31.793]  I should have, because I was up until 2 a.m.
[02:47:31.833 --> 02:47:32.353]  last night.
[02:47:33.134 --> 02:47:34.395]  But they're all excellent.
[02:47:34.415 --> 02:47:35.276]  They're all just clones.
[02:47:35.296 --> 02:47:36.397]  I've already missed so many times.
[02:47:36.537 --> 02:47:38.719]  I want to get some before I get back on that plane.
[02:47:38.739 --> 02:47:39.359]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:47:39.379 --> 02:47:41.801]  Okay, well, I'm going to tell you right now what you want.
[02:47:41.842 --> 02:47:44.023]  I'm going to tell you what you want right now.
[02:47:44.184 --> 02:47:44.424]  Yeah?
[02:47:45.164 --> 02:47:46.846]  You want... No, that's Rocket Rush.
[02:47:46.886 --> 02:47:47.506]  You need to sleep.
[02:47:47.626 --> 02:47:48.187]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:47:48.707 --> 02:47:49.848]  Well, I will take that later tonight.
[02:47:51.641 --> 02:47:52.882]  Next level foundational energy.
[02:47:53.443 --> 02:47:53.783]  There it is.
[02:47:53.823 --> 02:47:54.243]  Let me see.
[02:47:54.283 --> 02:47:55.604]  And there's no speed in that.
[02:47:55.865 --> 02:47:57.306]  It's methyl folate to break down.
[02:47:57.326 --> 02:47:58.026]  Oh, wow.
[02:47:58.707 --> 02:47:59.147]  Oh, yeah.
[02:47:59.248 --> 02:48:02.350]  It's methyl folate to break down of what's in spinach.
[02:48:02.490 --> 02:48:03.691]  There's a lot in here, too, by the way.
[02:48:03.711 --> 02:48:04.192]  Methyl folate acid.
[02:48:04.232 --> 02:48:04.472]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:48:04.492 --> 02:48:05.433]  There's a ton in here.
[02:48:05.493 --> 02:48:06.714]  The point is, it's a great product.
[02:48:07.114 --> 02:48:10.677]  This isn't one of the ones where they, you know, put the cotton in on the top so you only get a little bit.
[02:48:10.697 --> 02:48:11.498]  This is full.
[02:48:11.518 --> 02:48:12.419]  You're nice to support us.
[02:48:21.550 --> 02:48:24.191]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:48:25.771 --> 02:48:27.492]  Wild times we're living in, man.
[02:48:27.512 --> 02:48:31.693]  I've been around for a long time, never seen a trip like this before.
[02:48:31.713 --> 02:48:39.836]  I want to talk a little bit before I go into, we made our trend forecast for the presidential reality show.
[02:48:39.916 --> 02:48:41.137]  That to me is all it is.
[02:48:42.377 --> 02:48:45.478]  And again, in trend forecasting, it's not what you like.
[02:48:46.178 --> 02:48:47.459]  It's not what you want.
[02:48:48.499 --> 02:48:49.880]  It's not what you wish for.
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:50.440]  It's what is.
[02:48:51.934 --> 02:48:55.577]  So we call the trends for what they are, not the way we want them to be.
[02:48:57.239 --> 02:49:04.406]  On the market front, you see the Dow's down, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq's up a little bit.
[02:49:07.288 --> 02:49:17.858]  They're going to do everything they can to keep the markets rising between now and the next 100 days for the presidential reality show.
[02:49:19.889 --> 02:49:27.631]  The Democrats will do everything they can to keep boosting the market, which also means lowering interest rates.
[02:49:30.551 --> 02:49:37.653]  So, they're going to lower them in the run-up to the election.
[02:49:40.273 --> 02:49:42.994]  They do it all the time, and they're going to do it again.
[02:49:43.014 --> 02:49:46.835]  They're going to do everything they can to boost the economy.
[02:49:51.718 --> 02:49:57.281]  Problems that could confront them, we're the only ones talking about.
[02:49:58.822 --> 02:50:03.664]  And that is the office building bust that's going to bring down the Bankster Bandits.
[02:50:04.945 --> 02:50:12.989]  And there are a couple of articles that came out in the past week, just talking a little bit about it.
[02:50:14.550 --> 02:50:17.672]  Blackstone's battered mortgage funds slumps.
[02:50:18.644 --> 02:50:22.065]  As empty offices intensify pressure.
[02:50:24.625 --> 02:50:25.525]  Yes, from Reuters.
[02:50:26.186 --> 02:50:26.906]  You're no kidding.
[02:50:27.766 --> 02:50:29.066]  You've been saying this for how long?
[02:50:31.987 --> 02:50:34.887]  The latest signs of mounting woes in commercial real estate.
[02:50:35.688 --> 02:50:47.490]  Analysts are predicting more weakness for lenders and owners in the sector as American workers maintain their pandemic era remote work habits.
[02:50:49.955 --> 02:51:08.624]  Not pandemic era, slime ball politicians, moronic lockdown mandates that locked up the country and caused the office building bust.
[02:51:10.825 --> 02:51:12.226]  Total BS, but
[02:51:13.499 --> 02:51:15.601]  What do you have, an office vacancy rate?
[02:51:15.921 --> 02:51:17.863]  Nobody there, nobody there.
[02:51:18.323 --> 02:51:20.826]  In San Francisco, what, almost 35%?
[02:51:21.286 --> 02:51:29.453]  It was about 3.5% before the COVID war that people call the pandemic.
[02:51:29.513 --> 02:51:31.575]  The pandemic was a made-up word.
[02:51:31.976 --> 02:51:32.956]  These are the facts.
[02:51:33.257 --> 02:51:35.559]  You only get the facts in the Trends Journal.
[02:51:36.388 --> 02:51:48.236]  The World Horror Organization, oh no, no, excuse me, the World Health Organization, called it a pandemic on March 11th, 2020, when the grand total of 4,219 people died out of 8 billion.
[02:51:48.276 --> 02:51:48.416]  Got it?
[02:51:48.436 --> 02:51:49.396]  Wasn't a pandemic.
[02:52:02.726 --> 02:52:06.508]  99.3% of the people are still alive!
[02:52:06.528 --> 02:52:12.211]  Oh, and the Black Plague hit, what did they say, about 60% of Europe was wiped out?
[02:52:14.052 --> 02:52:16.393]  I'm going back to this because this is serious.
[02:52:17.594 --> 02:52:23.416]  There's going to be a banking crisis the likes of which no one is talking about other than us.
[02:52:24.297 --> 02:52:25.497]  It's one of your top trends for 2024.
[02:52:27.901 --> 02:52:29.102]  And what about gold prices?
[02:52:29.282 --> 02:52:32.324]  They're only now about what?
[02:52:32.564 --> 02:52:33.444]  $2,380 an ounce?
[02:52:35.866 --> 02:52:36.086]  Yeah.
[02:52:36.947 --> 02:52:39.608]  The lower interest rates go, the higher gold prices go.
[02:52:40.469 --> 02:52:41.710]  Listen, we're going to take a break.
[02:52:42.530 --> 02:52:45.092]  And again, we're going to have a lot to talk about.
[02:52:45.172 --> 02:52:45.972]  Very important.
[02:52:46.573 --> 02:52:48.554]  And most of all, support InfoWars.
[02:52:49.034 --> 02:52:50.515]  Keep the truth alive.
[02:52:50.855 --> 02:52:52.616]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:52:52.636 --> 02:52:56.759]  And as I said, do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[02:52:57.438 --> 02:52:59.640]  Because they're doing everything they can to support you.
[02:52:59.760 --> 02:53:01.281]  They have a great staff, everybody.
[02:53:01.321 --> 02:53:04.083]  They work so hard to bring you the best that they can.
[02:53:05.284 --> 02:53:10.188]  And we're going to talk about some of the articles that are being featured on InfoWars today.
[02:53:10.228 --> 02:53:11.849]  They're very trend worthy.
[02:53:12.770 --> 02:53:13.390]  You know, go back.
[02:53:13.851 --> 02:53:18.714]  Let's look at the headlines coming out on the mainstream media and the business news.
[02:53:19.255 --> 02:53:26.260]  McDonald's executives acknowledged Monday that diners considered the company's prices too high.
[02:53:27.793 --> 02:53:28.273]  Diners.
[02:53:30.174 --> 02:53:31.595]  That to me ain't dining, man.
[02:53:33.196 --> 02:53:34.516]  I like to dine fine.
[02:53:35.057 --> 02:53:38.698]  With fine wine and fine ladies and fine times, you know?
[02:53:39.379 --> 02:53:40.819]  This ain't fine dining.
[02:53:41.640 --> 02:53:42.600]  It's junk food.
[02:53:43.601 --> 02:53:45.021]  And that's what America looks like.
[02:53:46.062 --> 02:53:51.084]  As I said, when I was a young guy, they had a thing called the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus.
[02:53:51.584 --> 02:53:52.405]  It went out of business.
[02:53:53.328 --> 02:53:57.270]  You don't have to step right up, step right up and see the fat man and the tattooed lady.
[02:53:57.290 --> 02:53:58.150]  They're everywhere now.
[02:53:59.191 --> 02:54:01.512]  So going back to this, the people can't afford it.
[02:54:02.432 --> 02:54:05.494]  Again, all things are connected in trend forecasting.
[02:54:05.514 --> 02:54:10.156]  So I'm going back because I'm going to talk about who's going to win the presidential reality show.
[02:54:11.437 --> 02:54:13.157]  And the markets have a lot to do with it.
[02:54:15.419 --> 02:54:19.981]  So you're looking at the average consumer is suffering.
[02:54:21.642 --> 02:54:22.422]  They hit hard.
[02:54:24.921 --> 02:54:27.983]  And again, the numbers are all here.
[02:54:29.164 --> 02:54:29.885]  We got here.
[02:54:35.249 --> 02:54:44.016]  It's one company after another coming down with poor info.
[02:54:47.598 --> 02:54:52.002]  Stellantis NV's earnings plummeted in the first six months of the year.
[02:54:52.702 --> 02:54:53.583]  One car company
[02:54:54.159 --> 02:55:00.544]  After another, Tesla's profits drop 45% as sales cool.
[02:55:03.707 --> 02:55:04.608]  U.S.
[02:55:04.848 --> 02:55:09.812]  tech slide deepens after big names fail to hit targets.
[02:55:12.194 --> 02:55:15.957]  Struggling German economy drags down Eurozone growth.
[02:55:18.098 --> 02:55:18.659]  It's global.
[02:55:21.172 --> 02:55:25.193]  GM delays electric vehicle build-out and sign a weakening demand.
[02:55:25.553 --> 02:55:30.574]  Yeah, one of our top trends for 2024 is EVs go FU.
[02:55:31.534 --> 02:55:32.294]  It ain't happening.
[02:55:33.254 --> 02:55:35.454]  And then again, you got to look at the data coming in.
[02:55:36.795 --> 02:55:40.595]  And it's the luxury sales down across the board.
[02:55:42.196 --> 02:55:44.196]  So the fish rots from their head down.
[02:55:45.016 --> 02:55:47.036]  So that's what we report in the Trends Journal.
[02:55:47.376 --> 02:55:50.537]  It's not only hurting at McDonald's, it's hurting all over.
[02:55:51.877 --> 02:55:53.558]  So they're going to lower interest rates.
[02:55:54.779 --> 02:55:57.801]  The lower interest rates goes, the deeper the dollar falls.
[02:55:58.421 --> 02:56:01.983]  And this is the beginning, by the way, of the death of the dollar.
[02:56:04.385 --> 02:56:07.167]  The lower the dollar falls, the higher gold prices rise.
[02:56:08.828 --> 02:56:18.114]  Again, when you're looking at the electric vehicles, we've been saying since 2017 in your Trends Journal that these are not
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:24.122]  An answer to the problem.
[02:56:24.723 --> 02:56:27.906]  The battery was invented in 1800.
[02:56:28.046 --> 02:56:32.330]  Look at these stupid big things.
[02:56:32.710 --> 02:56:37.034]  Oh, and they're so clean with all that lithium and all those other things you got to pump into them.
[02:56:37.615 --> 02:56:38.576]  So they're going down.
[02:56:39.697 --> 02:56:46.043]  And again, so too is the office building bust.
[02:56:49.039 --> 02:57:11.511]  Deutsche Bank became a punching bag for investors last week because the bank's US stocks fell nearly 10% after Germany's biggest lender reported its lowest net income since the 2019 crisis.
[02:57:12.992 --> 02:57:18.435]  And a lot of it has to do with office building.
[02:57:19.033 --> 02:57:19.533]  Failures.
[02:57:19.633 --> 02:57:21.695]  They can't pay their loans.
[02:57:23.516 --> 02:57:27.398]  So going back, it's not only consumers at the bottom.
[02:57:27.999 --> 02:57:37.705]  More than 60% of respondents to a recent LendingTree survey said they've cut back their fast food spending because it's too expensive.
[02:57:38.325 --> 02:57:41.127]  And again, you look at the luxury sales.
[02:57:43.468 --> 02:57:47.391]  Gucci owner Kearings results hit by revamp.
[02:57:49.696 --> 02:57:52.517]  China malaise spreads to luxury sector.
[02:57:53.237 --> 02:57:54.298]  It's one after another.
[02:57:55.518 --> 02:58:00.560]  And then going back to the office building bust, this is an article in The Wall.
[02:58:00.620 --> 02:58:04.701]  I can't say the right word because it's an S and H and has an I and a T in it.
[02:58:04.841 --> 02:58:05.241]  Journal.
[02:58:06.362 --> 02:58:09.823]  This is how they report the office building bust without reporting it.
[02:58:11.364 --> 02:58:13.905]  DC office markets struggle to persist.
[02:58:15.365 --> 02:58:18.086]  The district's office vacancy rate rose to a new high
[02:58:19.050 --> 02:58:21.011]  Of 24.4% in the second quarter.
[02:58:23.172 --> 02:58:38.660]  They go on to say that in the first quarter, about 39% of Washington's office loans were scrutinized, or securitized rather, were either in default or at risk.
[02:58:39.420 --> 02:58:41.021]  So we're talking about 40%, 40% of the office loans
[02:58:47.702 --> 02:58:48.482]  Are at risk.
[02:58:49.402 --> 02:58:50.863]  This should be big news.
[02:58:53.023 --> 02:58:55.384]  I'm showing you the way they play it down.
[02:59:00.425 --> 02:59:08.886]  According to the credit research firm KBRA Analytics, the seventh highest rate in the country.
[02:59:09.667 --> 02:59:10.147]  Oh, wait a minute.
[02:59:10.867 --> 02:59:12.207]  They have the seventh highest rate?
[02:59:13.327 --> 02:59:16.508]  How about the rest of the article talking about the other six?
[02:59:18.317 --> 02:59:19.518]  Who are the other six?
[02:59:20.318 --> 02:59:21.839]  What are their vacancy rates?
[02:59:22.239 --> 02:59:24.120]  And what are the failures on the loans?
[02:59:26.162 --> 02:59:27.322]  Screw you, Salenti.
[02:59:27.342 --> 02:59:28.383]  We're not going to tell you.
[02:59:28.683 --> 02:59:29.804]  We're prostitutes.
[02:59:30.204 --> 02:59:31.845]  We got to keep the game going.
[02:59:36.387 --> 02:59:36.667]  So.
[02:59:40.149 --> 02:59:42.491]  Brings us back to the presidential reality show.
[02:59:46.513 --> 02:59:48.034]  This is from the Wall Street Journal.
[02:59:49.764 --> 02:59:52.766]  Harris's past hints at economic policy.
[02:59:54.327 --> 02:59:59.190]  She has focused on low-income workers, women, and small business.
[03:00:00.551 --> 03:00:00.731]  Yep.
[03:00:04.414 --> 03:00:12.920]  Harris blasts Trump vision as one of chaos, fear, and hate in fiery teachers' union speech.
[03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:14.120]  This was last Thursday.
[03:00:14.801 --> 03:00:17.122]  Again, I want to make this 100% clear.
[03:00:19.813 --> 03:00:20.594]  I don't like either of them.
[03:00:21.434 --> 03:00:22.455]  They don't represent me.
[03:00:23.315 --> 03:00:25.777]  Last person I voted for president was Ron Paul.
[03:00:27.518 --> 03:00:29.319]  I'm a political atheist.
[03:00:29.359 --> 03:00:32.921]  To me, the Repulsicans and the Democrats are a crime syndicate.
[03:00:33.241 --> 03:00:34.502]  I only call it the way it is.
[03:00:36.383 --> 03:00:40.205]  Again, it's not what you like as a trend forecaster, what you want, what you wish for.
[03:00:40.506 --> 03:00:41.786]  I'm not selling anything.
[03:00:43.087 --> 03:00:44.648]  Except the truth in trends.
[03:00:46.089 --> 03:00:46.989]  So I want to make this 100% clear.
[03:00:52.333 --> 03:01:01.656]  So, in this moment, we're in the fight for our most fundamental freedoms, Harris said, in a keynote address to the American Federation of Teachers.
[03:01:04.738 --> 03:01:05.678]  Bring it on!
[03:01:08.139 --> 03:01:13.341]  She said, before the audience began loudly chanting that same phrase.
[03:01:14.521 --> 03:01:16.282]  And listen to what they write.
[03:01:17.682 --> 03:01:19.223]  And listen to what she said.
[03:01:21.072 --> 03:01:48.725]  Harris contrasted her agenda of abortion rights, LGBTQ, M-O-U-S-C, whatever else, gun control, support for organized labor, and student debt relief with the policies of the Republican nominee, Trump.
[03:01:49.827 --> 03:01:51.307]  And his allies on those issues.
[03:01:57.189 --> 03:02:01.229]  Again, it's not what you, all right, now you see how she's dancing like that?
[03:02:02.070 --> 03:02:03.410]  And you saw everybody else's?
[03:02:04.610 --> 03:02:06.450]  Hate it, love it, don't like it.
[03:02:07.551 --> 03:02:18.333]  People like that better than Trump coming out and rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.
[03:02:19.801 --> 03:02:20.181]  All right?
[03:02:20.521 --> 03:02:22.182]  She's playing the game.
[03:02:23.903 --> 03:02:24.704]  It's a game.
[03:02:26.404 --> 03:02:27.865]  It's a reality show.
[03:02:28.806 --> 03:02:38.691]  She comes out smiling, dancing, feeling good, bringing up- I'm trying to chop his- Alright?
[03:02:40.412 --> 03:02:41.672]  She has an audience for that.
[03:02:42.813 --> 03:02:44.674]  She has a bigger audience for the other thing.
[03:02:46.175 --> 03:02:48.736]  Again, we only call it like we see it.
[03:02:50.071 --> 03:02:54.595]  So, all the Trump lovers, I don't want to hear your crap.
[03:02:55.756 --> 03:02:57.257]  I'm just putting out the facts.
[03:02:57.477 --> 03:03:00.500]  If the facts are wrong, let us know.
[03:03:01.901 --> 03:03:04.002]  But if it's not what you believe, I don't give a damn.
[03:03:04.022 --> 03:03:07.145]  You don't believe in my God?
[03:03:07.345 --> 03:03:08.826]  How dare you not believe in my God?
[03:03:08.866 --> 03:03:11.589]  There's only 4,000 religions, I'll tell you which God to believe in.
[03:03:12.229 --> 03:03:13.050]  Anyway, going back.
[03:03:18.134 --> 03:03:18.915]  This is our
[03:03:20.211 --> 03:03:27.435]  Special trend alert that we sent out to subscribers on Thursday.
[03:03:28.856 --> 03:03:31.197]  Kamala Harris 2024.
[03:03:34.279 --> 03:03:39.862]  The Trends Journal's May 2022 trend forecast.
[03:03:40.382 --> 03:03:44.604]  We made this forecast back in May of 2022.
[03:03:44.964 --> 03:03:46.565]  The facts are in your Trends Journal.
[03:03:46.865 --> 03:03:49.327]  And by the way, I forgot all about this.
[03:03:51.266 --> 03:03:54.309]  We wrote about abortion in this week's Trends Journal.
[03:03:54.549 --> 03:03:57.953]  I had my assistant look it up, and then Harris popped up.
[03:03:59.475 --> 03:04:02.938]  And I'm going to go back to why we made this forecast back in 2022.
[03:04:03.639 --> 03:04:07.423]  I thought they were going to pick Gatson Gavin Newsom.
[03:04:07.823 --> 03:04:08.384]  I was wrong.
[03:04:09.685 --> 03:04:12.408]  But I said they're going to get rid of Biden.
[03:04:14.102 --> 03:04:18.664]  I said we're going to get rid of Biden, we're going to replace, and I forgot all about this.
[03:04:18.724 --> 03:04:23.326]  We wrote about this again over two years ago, in May of 2022.
[03:04:24.006 --> 03:04:34.691]  The Trends Journal had forecast that Joe Biden would step down and Kamala Harris would run for president in 2024.
[03:04:35.892 --> 03:04:38.833]  And now we forecast minus a wild card.
[03:04:40.023 --> 03:04:42.245]  You'd never know the wild card that could be played.
[03:04:42.445 --> 03:04:44.407]  Market crashes, Trump wins.
[03:04:45.088 --> 03:04:45.808]  Something like that.
[03:04:46.429 --> 03:04:52.695]  Minus a wild card, such as a stock market crash, Harris will beat Donald Trump in the race to the White House.
[03:04:54.196 --> 03:04:59.721]  This was our 17 May 2022 trend forecast.
[03:05:00.001 --> 03:05:05.707]  Quote, Harris has aspirations to be President of the United States.
[03:05:06.855 --> 03:05:13.018]  And she knows that her boss is an unpopular president who is 79 years old.
[03:05:13.138 --> 03:05:15.179]  Again, this is going back two years ago.
[03:05:16.799 --> 03:05:29.305]  She wants to be the party's standard bearer and needs to start making a name for herself if she hopes to run for president again.
[03:05:31.184 --> 03:05:39.773]  Being that the Biden administration is viewed as ineffective in bringing down inflation and boosting the economy.
[03:05:39.793 --> 03:05:40.734]  You ready?
[03:05:43.537 --> 03:05:44.818]  This is what we forecast.
[03:05:45.980 --> 03:05:49.003]  Harris will seize upon abortion rights
[03:05:49.853 --> 03:05:57.715]  Because there seems to be only two things she can use to unite her front.
[03:05:57.875 --> 03:06:01.276]  Again, this is going back to 2022, the midterm elections.
[03:06:02.157 --> 03:06:05.698]  The Ukraine war support and pro-abortion.
[03:06:07.558 --> 03:06:07.898]  Okay.
[03:06:08.958 --> 03:06:11.339]  Now, why did we write about this back then?
[03:06:13.640 --> 03:06:17.581]  About her coming out and supporting
[03:06:19.798 --> 03:06:25.642]  The Ukraine war and pro-abortion because we wrote what a hypocrite she was.
[03:06:26.363 --> 03:06:31.426]  So just to make it clear to any dope that thinks I believe in this clown.
[03:06:33.608 --> 03:06:37.511]  We made it clear what a hypocrite she was because here she is.
[03:06:38.451 --> 03:06:40.312]  My body, my choice.
[03:06:41.193 --> 03:06:42.834]  My body, my choice.
[03:06:44.776 --> 03:06:45.976]  And I said, hey.
[03:06:47.217 --> 03:06:49.319]  How about my body?
[03:06:50.263 --> 03:06:51.064]  My choice.
[03:06:51.704 --> 03:07:08.734]  I don't want to get the COVID jab that you're promoting and the gang behind you that are destroying people's lives because they won't get the Operation Warp Speed gene therapy inoculation.
[03:07:09.894 --> 03:07:11.955]  How about my body, my choice?
[03:07:13.316 --> 03:07:14.557]  That's why we wrote about it.
[03:07:15.017 --> 03:07:16.318]  Screw you, Salenti!
[03:07:17.139 --> 03:07:18.199]  You have no choice!
[03:07:18.559 --> 03:07:19.780]  Oh, only women have a choice?
[03:07:19.800 --> 03:07:21.220]  Why, how sexist of you!
[03:07:22.261 --> 03:07:23.241]  How sexist!
[03:07:24.881 --> 03:07:27.682]  My body, my choice, but not my body, my choice!
[03:07:28.002 --> 03:07:31.063]  When it comes to getting the COVID jab, you fraud!
[03:07:32.864 --> 03:07:36.165]  Oh, she was out there pumping that jab, man!
[03:07:36.925 --> 03:07:38.146]  Pumping that jab!
[03:07:38.446 --> 03:07:40.987]  Oh, if you don't get it, you're gonna kill everybody around you!
[03:07:41.027 --> 03:07:41.187]  Yeah!
[03:07:46.266 --> 03:07:47.306]  Kamala, crap!
[03:07:48.787 --> 03:07:51.088]  So, again, we call it like we see it.
[03:07:51.848 --> 03:07:55.450]  Not what you like, not what you want, what is.
[03:07:56.230 --> 03:07:58.191]  That's why we wrote this article.
[03:07:59.632 --> 03:08:00.712]  And another reason.
[03:08:05.014 --> 03:08:15.138]  We had also forecast that despite Joe Biden's low approval rating during the 2022 midterm election season,
[03:08:16.437 --> 03:08:29.939]  The Republicans would lose the opportunity to have a stronghouse majority, which they did lose because of their anti-abortion platform.
[03:08:31.620 --> 03:08:44.342]  And that Kamala Harris, ready this is a quote, as the Democratic heir, H-E-I-R with quotes on it, would seize upon the opportunity which she did.
[03:08:47.125 --> 03:09:04.211]  In our May 2022 Trends Journal, we wrote in our Trend Post, quote, Harris no doubt is thrilled to finally have a topic that resonates with Americans who are growing increasingly frustrated with the Biden administration.
[03:09:05.931 --> 03:09:11.393]  A newly released CBS News YouGov poll found that nearly 8 in 10 voters
[03:09:12.142 --> 03:09:13.903]  Say conditions in the U.S.
[03:09:14.484 --> 03:09:23.930]  are going somewhat or very badly and 56% disapprove of how Biden is handling the presidential duties.
[03:09:24.850 --> 03:09:29.453]  Remember, this is our trend post from May of 2022.
[03:09:30.754 --> 03:09:37.238]  These numbers do not bode well for Harris, who theoretically is heir to the Democratic Party.
[03:09:38.160 --> 03:09:47.125]  So she's latching on the topic that resonates with single issue voters and core constituencies.
[03:09:48.066 --> 03:09:51.868]  Remember what I said, single issue voters.
[03:09:54.749 --> 03:09:55.950]  That's what it's all about.
[03:09:58.451 --> 03:10:00.152]  And core constituencies.
[03:10:01.693 --> 03:10:06.256]  Again, there is no better single issue than abortion.
[03:10:07.384 --> 03:10:09.145]  Again, this is from our Trend Post.
[03:10:09.865 --> 03:10:14.407]  Gerald Cilenti has long said that when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:10:15.228 --> 03:10:29.515]  In electoral politics, Democrats going into the midterm elections, that saying could be edited to, quote, when all else fails, they bring up abortion rights.
[03:10:31.896 --> 03:10:32.536]  There you got it.
[03:10:34.317 --> 03:10:35.818]  We go on to say,
[03:10:38.527 --> 03:10:43.390]  Political atheist, again, Slenty says it's not what you want, what you wish for, what you believe in.
[03:10:44.091 --> 03:10:46.272]  We're trend forecasters, it's what is.
[03:10:47.153 --> 03:10:48.113]  Now let's go on.
[03:10:49.594 --> 03:10:52.236]  When Donald Trump picked J.D.
[03:10:52.296 --> 03:11:03.543]  Vance as VP, I said on Alex Jones, I was doing the show that Monday, when they announced it, I said, this is a bad pick.
[03:11:05.584 --> 03:11:08.066]  And I only gave one reason why, and now there are more.
[03:11:09.190 --> 03:11:12.071]  I said you don't get a guy from a state that you won big.
[03:11:13.011 --> 03:11:16.593]  Trump won Ohio big over Biden in 2020.
[03:11:17.673 --> 03:11:22.855]  You should have got somebody from a swing state that you need like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin.
[03:11:24.276 --> 03:11:25.196]  That was what I said.
[03:11:28.041 --> 03:11:30.742]  Should have picked a candidate that would have helped him in a swing state.
[03:11:31.162 --> 03:11:43.085]  Now, making a bad pick much worse, Salenti said that, quote, Vance being so anti-abortion and pro-life is going to make them lose the presidential election.
[03:11:44.105 --> 03:11:55.688]  Indeed, Vance has been highly criticized for his recent comment, calling women without children, quote, a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives
[03:11:56.431 --> 03:12:01.735]  And the choices that they made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.
[03:12:02.756 --> 03:12:04.057]  Now let's go back to Trump.
[03:12:05.718 --> 03:12:13.764]  On the Trump side of abortion, according to previous statements, Harris will blast him for his stance.
[03:12:15.966 --> 03:12:24.112]  Indeed, we wrote in our 30 May 2023 Trends Journal trend post, quote,
[03:12:25.316 --> 03:12:33.520]  Trump has called himself, quote, the most pro-life president in the American history.
[03:12:34.920 --> 03:12:38.982]  And his Supreme Court appointments overturned Roe versus Wade.
[03:12:39.963 --> 03:12:53.449]  Trump took credit, quote, for killing the law that had been placed for 50 years, quote, after 50 years of failure with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe versus Wade
[03:12:54.207 --> 03:12:55.849]  Much to the shock of everyone.
[03:12:56.609 --> 03:13:03.115]  Without me, there would be no six weeks, 10 weeks, 15 weeks, or whatever is finally agreed to.
[03:13:03.716 --> 03:13:08.119]  Without me, the pro-life movement would have just kept losing.
[03:13:10.522 --> 03:13:11.242]  So there you got it.
[03:13:15.046 --> 03:13:16.647]  Again, the data.
[03:13:19.750 --> 03:13:21.171]  We noted this in this article.
[03:13:22.282 --> 03:13:36.652]  NBC News noted that the Public Policy Research Institute ran a national poll in February that found 64% of Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.
[03:13:37.092 --> 03:13:36.652]  64%!
[03:13:39.354 --> 03:13:44.357]  Which is an increase of 55% from 2010.
[03:13:45.898 --> 03:13:48.360]  The poll was broken down as a political affiliation.
[03:13:48.380 --> 03:13:49.881]  87% of Democrats
[03:13:53.331 --> 03:13:55.592]  And 65% of independents.
[03:13:57.552 --> 03:13:59.673]  All right?
[03:13:59.693 --> 03:14:02.653]  65% of independents.
[03:14:03.153 --> 03:14:03.954]  87% of Democrats.
[03:14:06.414 --> 03:14:12.035]  And 37% of Republicans say abortion should be legal.
[03:14:18.877 --> 03:14:22.698]  Again, the election becomes a single issue
[03:14:25.719 --> 03:14:31.763]  She's going to get a major number of women voters.
[03:14:32.623 --> 03:14:34.784]  She's going to get the black voters.
[03:14:37.526 --> 03:14:41.829]  There's an article on InfoWars today.
[03:14:41.849 --> 03:14:42.809]  It looks like I'll find it.
[03:14:43.790 --> 03:14:44.770]  Got so much stuff here.
[03:14:45.871 --> 03:14:48.092]  It's about, where is it here?
[03:14:48.112 --> 03:14:49.073]  Yeah, here he is.
[03:14:49.913 --> 03:14:51.154]  That guy James Carville.
[03:14:51.693 --> 03:14:53.474]  This is the article on InfoWars.
[03:14:54.434 --> 03:14:55.794]  She's going to get slaughtered.
[03:14:56.114 --> 03:15:00.555]  James Carville warns that Kamala Harris' horrible record will be exposed.
[03:15:02.096 --> 03:15:13.839]  Democratic political strategist James Carville warned his party that Kamala Harris will face an onslaught of political attacks exposing her record and past remarks that her campaign must prepare for.
[03:15:15.740 --> 03:15:18.220]  Yep, this is very true and we're going to go through those.
[03:15:19.901 --> 03:15:20.841]  But it's bigger than that.
[03:15:23.678 --> 03:15:25.561]  Again, we'll be right back.
[03:15:25.861 --> 03:15:27.964]  Support Info Wars, a lot more to tell you.
[03:15:39.960 --> 03:15:48.789]  If you want to give your cardiovascular system a leg up, if you want to go in and help clean out and purify your blood, ladies and gentlemen, Nitric Boost is the way to go.
[03:15:49.069 --> 03:15:51.992]  You've heard Dr. Judy Mikovits talk about how it's an amazing formula.
[03:15:52.312 --> 03:15:53.813]  This is what she's recommended to people.
[03:15:53.833 --> 03:15:56.896]  Ladies and gentlemen, it does so many great things.
[03:15:57.497 --> 03:16:00.580]  Like, but you notice what happens in the morning if you're a man.
[03:16:00.600 --> 03:16:02.422]  I feel like I'm 16 years old again.
[03:16:02.742 --> 03:16:07.045]  When I was 16, I'd already had probably... I hate to brag, so I'm not bragging.
[03:16:07.065 --> 03:16:07.826]  It's actually shameful.
[03:16:08.046 --> 03:16:09.607]  Probably 150 women or more.
[03:16:09.627 --> 03:16:10.567]  That's conservative.
[03:16:10.908 --> 03:16:12.629]  Nitric Boost is simply amazing.
[03:16:12.669 --> 03:16:13.890]  It's great for women as well.

[03:16:32.765 --> 03:16:34.286]  Yeah, it was music that they were playing.
[03:16:34.326 --> 03:16:36.408]  Once upon a time, there was a thing called music.
[03:16:36.708 --> 03:16:38.109]  They had instruments.
[03:16:38.930 --> 03:16:40.471]  Everything's AI, we own you.

[03:16:45.735 --> 03:16:51.840]  A synthesized devolution by Joe Duran, who writes our Technocracy and other articles in the Trends Journal.
[03:16:53.141 --> 03:16:54.162]  All the vibe is gone.
[03:16:54.903 --> 03:16:55.263]  Anyway,
[03:16:56.778 --> 03:16:57.719]  The vibe is gone.
[03:16:58.019 --> 03:16:58.900]  The news is gone.

[03:17:16.997 --> 03:17:17.498]  What can I do?
[03:17:17.538 --> 03:17:19.880]  I said, the best thing you have to do is get in the best shape you can.
[03:17:21.098 --> 03:17:22.959]  Physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[03:17:22.999 --> 03:17:27.842]  And they got a lot of help both mentally, physically, and spiritually in their physical end.
[03:17:28.282 --> 03:17:29.923]  They got the InfoWars MD.
[03:17:30.523 --> 03:17:32.364]  And these premium supplements.

[03:18:52.689 --> 03:18:56.691]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:18:57.571 --> 03:18:57.771]  Yep.
[03:18:58.011 --> 03:18:58.872]  Good night, sleep.
[03:18:59.752 --> 03:19:00.292]  Nighty night.
[03:19:02.453 --> 03:19:02.693]  So.
[03:19:03.593 --> 03:19:05.214]  Do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:19:05.674 --> 03:19:07.355]  Because they're doing what they can to support you.
[03:19:10.636 --> 03:19:13.737]  I like a little bit of rosé in that hot summertime.
[03:19:14.557 --> 03:19:16.338]  Summertime and the living is easy.
[03:19:18.442 --> 03:19:25.788]  You know, I talk about campaigns, so when I write about what I'm telling you about, they're not empty words.
[03:19:27.609 --> 03:19:28.130]  You see this?
[03:19:32.753 --> 03:19:34.695]  Love blooms on the campaign trail.
[03:19:35.736 --> 03:19:39.999]  That's me in 1971 with my former wife, may she rest in peace, Marianne.
[03:19:41.525 --> 03:19:48.708]  We started dating during the campaign and somehow ended up being the prime example that love and politics make a good combination, said Miriam.
[03:19:50.708 --> 03:19:58.972]  And it goes on and I was the campaign coordinator for this guy Angelo Martinelli, who became the longest running mayor of Yonkers, New York.
[03:19:59.352 --> 03:20:01.733]  It's a large city, it's over 200,000 people.
[03:20:03.273 --> 03:20:10.756]  And I worked on other campaigns in Westchester County.
[03:20:12.062 --> 03:20:14.243]  Which was the richest county in America at the time.
[03:20:15.744 --> 03:20:18.686]  And I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate.
[03:20:20.667 --> 03:20:25.329]  And I designed and instructed a course called American Politics and Campaign Technology.
[03:20:26.930 --> 03:20:28.811]  Which is how to run political campaigns.
[03:20:28.931 --> 03:20:29.792]  And I taught it at St.
[03:20:29.832 --> 03:20:30.692]  John's University.
[03:20:31.673 --> 03:20:41.378]  So what I'm saying about the election comes from my experience in the campaign field.
[03:20:42.962 --> 03:20:44.323]  N as a trend forecaster.
[03:20:46.104 --> 03:20:53.149]  And going back, the reason why we wrote that about Harris selling the pro-abortion line.
[03:20:53.189 --> 03:20:56.312]  And again, it's not what you want, what you wish for, what you like, what you dislike.
[03:20:56.352 --> 03:20:56.932]  It's none of that.
[03:20:57.573 --> 03:21:00.134]  We wrote about it to show her hypocrisy.
[03:21:01.135 --> 03:21:05.098]  So again, making connections between different fields and why you go to InfoWars.
[03:21:05.118 --> 03:21:07.520]  20 U.S.
[03:21:07.620 --> 03:21:12.103]  universities still require a COVID vaccine despite science.
[03:21:14.019 --> 03:21:19.381]  Hey, Kamala and Trump, where are you on these issues?
[03:21:21.302 --> 03:21:22.602]  My body, my choice?
[03:21:25.443 --> 03:21:27.364]  Let's not be sexist about this.
[03:21:28.964 --> 03:21:31.185]  Let's not be sexist about this.
[03:21:31.905 --> 03:21:33.766]  My body, my choice.
[03:21:35.427 --> 03:21:39.168]  You believe it's your choice to get an abortion, fine.
[03:21:39.188 --> 03:21:42.049]  I'm not telling you what to do.
[03:21:43.331 --> 03:21:49.553]  Don't tell me what to do when I don't want to get your jab, Harris, and all the rest of you.
[03:21:53.535 --> 03:21:59.017]  And by the way, only the data, because that's all we do at the Trends Journal.
[03:21:59.037 --> 03:22:05.760]  73 million 1 to 17 year olds in America, between January 22 and June 2023,
[03:22:12.665 --> 03:22:24.074]  When the CDC stopped doing the numbers under a little over 2000, 1 to 17 year olds died of COVID.
[03:22:24.794 --> 03:22:27.676]  But making them kids get to gym, don't go to school, don't go play.
[03:22:28.097 --> 03:22:30.379]  Oh yeah, that's the Harris clan.
[03:22:32.240 --> 03:22:39.946]  And Trump gave us state of emergency on March 13th, Black Friday 2020.
[03:22:39.986 --> 03:22:40.026]  So,
[03:22:42.486 --> 03:22:43.226]  Without the facts.
[03:22:44.906 --> 03:22:49.888]  So going back to that guy I was reading about, what Carvel said.
[03:22:55.049 --> 03:23:04.370]  He goes on to say, in the first 24 hours of Vice President Harris's campaign, she raised the record $81 million.
[03:23:04.430 --> 03:23:11.612]  Democrats have been significantly less enthusiastic about Biden than Republicans were about Trump until now.
[03:23:12.614 --> 03:23:18.558]  What is the key for the Vice President to sustain this excitement for a candidacy throughout the rest of the campaign?
[03:23:20.620 --> 03:23:26.404]  PBS's Margaret Hoover asked Carville last week on the show Firing Line.
[03:23:26.424 --> 03:23:30.547]  So that wasn't a quote from Carville, that was from this- PBS, yeah.
[03:23:30.908 --> 03:23:33.389]  The people's BS system.
[03:23:37.512 --> 03:23:40.395]  Carville questioned against Democrats' initial enthusiasm.
[03:23:40.675 --> 03:23:40.915]  Quote,
[03:23:42.148 --> 03:23:43.869]  That's the question, Carville replied.
[03:23:44.570 --> 03:23:46.872]  And the first thing is to recognize what happened.
[03:23:47.432 --> 03:23:49.894]  What happened was that people wanted something different.
[03:23:50.455 --> 03:23:55.299]  And that she just projects the fact that she is, you know, excited about the future.
[03:23:56.239 --> 03:23:58.741]  And there was no policy that anyone was pushing.
[03:23:59.262 --> 03:24:01.323]  And there were no particular group that was behind her.
[03:24:01.704 --> 03:24:02.424]  Very interesting.
[03:24:02.865 --> 03:24:04.986]  No policy that anyone was pushing.
[03:24:05.407 --> 03:24:06.708]  No particular group behind her.
[03:24:07.128 --> 03:24:10.671]  It was just the general feeling that people wanted a different choice than Donald Trump.
[03:24:12.315 --> 03:24:15.317]  He went on to say, and there's some good.
[03:24:16.597 --> 03:24:18.698]  Not that, look, she's gonna get slaughtered.
[03:24:20.379 --> 03:24:22.600]  They're coming out, they're coming, Carvel said.
[03:24:23.501 --> 03:24:25.742]  And this is just part of that.
[03:24:26.822 --> 03:24:30.384]  Will be no different than it was any other time.
[03:24:30.624 --> 03:24:31.085]  That's right.
[03:24:32.966 --> 03:24:34.026]  She won't get slaughtered.
[03:24:34.046 --> 03:24:37.228]  They will attack her on a number of levels.
[03:24:42.108 --> 03:24:53.475]  But what they're gonna attack her on isn't going to sway her core platform.
[03:24:54.976 --> 03:25:06.364]  The people that believe in abortion, the LGBTQXYZs, she's going to get the black vote.
[03:25:08.030 --> 03:25:13.233]  Yeah, you could come out and say the terrible things she did as a prosecutor and how she prosecuted.
[03:25:13.633 --> 03:25:14.953]  Yeah.
[03:25:14.973 --> 03:25:17.295]  And the facts don't matter.
[03:25:17.415 --> 03:25:19.356]  It's a soundbite world.
[03:25:26.219 --> 03:25:28.020]  There will be no different than any other time.
[03:25:28.640 --> 03:25:30.861]  And they have got to get up and get ready.
[03:25:32.322 --> 03:25:36.564]  And they've got to be able to defend and attack at the same time.
[03:25:38.462 --> 03:25:44.503]  There is gonna be a time of struggle of definition as to who Vice President Harris is.
[03:25:45.323 --> 03:25:46.683]  And we better be ready for that.
[03:25:48.784 --> 03:25:49.544]  Get ready for that.
[03:25:49.584 --> 03:25:50.164]  What are you kidding?
[03:25:52.064 --> 03:25:53.545]  Here's my take on all of this.
[03:25:54.785 --> 03:26:07.807]  I believe, again, because what we wrote in the Trends Journal going back to 2023, in 2022, they were planning to get rid of Biden all along.
[03:26:08.795 --> 03:26:10.135]  It's a reality show.
[03:26:11.776 --> 03:26:14.116]  Their timing could not have been better.
[03:26:17.257 --> 03:26:27.579]  I was asked to write an article for Sputnik, the Russian news agency, several days before the debate.
[03:26:29.420 --> 03:26:32.421]  I said, there's never been a debate in June.
[03:26:33.281 --> 03:26:35.401]  They don't begin until like late September.
[03:26:36.442 --> 03:26:37.982]  I said, they're doing this to show
[03:26:40.335 --> 03:26:41.916]  Biden's inadequacy.
[03:26:43.816 --> 03:26:48.758]  So then they could replace him and it's in front of everybody's eyes to see the why.
[03:26:54.400 --> 03:26:55.921]  That was at the end of June.
[03:26:58.341 --> 03:27:04.023]  Then they played the game that Biden, I'm not gonna quit, I'm not gonna quit, my family wants me to stay.
[03:27:04.483 --> 03:27:05.944]  What did Joe Biden say?
[03:27:05.964 --> 03:27:08.645]  Remember?
[03:27:09.670 --> 03:27:09.870]  Yep.
[03:27:12.031 --> 03:27:13.012]  That was the routine.
[03:27:15.533 --> 03:27:21.295]  Then the Republican convention happens and a terrible assassination attempt on Trump.
[03:27:23.116 --> 03:27:23.476]  Boom.
[03:27:24.697 --> 03:27:25.917]  Flying high in the polls.
[03:27:30.339 --> 03:27:36.542]  They waited till after that was over and then immediately announced Kamala Harris.
[03:27:37.703 --> 03:27:38.003]  And again,
[03:27:39.184 --> 03:27:41.085]  I thought Gavin Newsom was going to run.
[03:27:41.165 --> 03:27:42.726]  I forgot all about what we wrote.
[03:27:43.587 --> 03:27:47.110]  And we write the magazines over 200 pages, the stuff we write all the time.
[03:27:48.811 --> 03:27:49.071]  So.
[03:27:51.613 --> 03:27:53.374]  That's what you got.
[03:27:54.875 --> 03:27:55.916]  It's one big club.
[03:27:57.497 --> 03:28:00.819]  And you ain't in it, as George Carlin said.
[03:28:04.178 --> 03:28:05.459]  It goes back to the polls.
[03:28:06.119 --> 03:28:14.323]  Also, a sizable hate Trump segment of society, we wrote, would not have gone to the polls if Biden was running.
[03:28:16.424 --> 03:28:18.665]  But they're gonna go to the polls for Harris.
[03:28:20.046 --> 03:28:21.967]  So the hate Trumpers are gonna go out.
[03:28:23.628 --> 03:28:29.751]  And this is according to a March ABC News Ipsos poll. 54%
[03:28:32.768 --> 03:28:35.210]  So they had an unfavorable view of Trump.
[03:28:38.573 --> 03:28:38.813]  Yep.
[03:28:43.437 --> 03:28:45.919]  So they did this earlier.
[03:28:45.939 --> 03:28:51.203]  Rather than waiting for the Democratic nominate the convention.
[03:28:51.223 --> 03:28:54.226]  Because that's not going to be until.
[03:28:56.508 --> 03:28:57.368]  Later in August.
[03:28:58.669 --> 03:28:59.870]  They wouldn't have enough time.
[03:29:00.851 --> 03:29:01.672]  To get the word out.
[03:29:03.527 --> 03:29:04.967]  It was all planned out.
[03:29:07.908 --> 03:29:13.289]  When Trump, when Trump, Trump, Biden, Greenberg, Iceberg, what's the difference?
[03:29:14.789 --> 03:29:26.451]  When Biden won in our magazine, the Trends Journal, we said it's just a continuation of the Obama administration.
[03:29:27.211 --> 03:29:27.811]  Nothing changed.
[03:29:29.832 --> 03:29:32.072]  The Obama's still in charge, that whole gang.
[03:29:33.021 --> 03:29:33.782]  The whole club.
[03:29:34.262 --> 03:29:34.822]  The whole club.
[03:29:38.305 --> 03:29:39.126]  Rahm Emanuel.
[03:29:39.166 --> 03:29:39.746]  They're all coming.
[03:29:39.786 --> 03:29:41.007]  All the names are coming back in.
[03:29:41.567 --> 03:29:42.288]  All coming back in.
[03:29:44.590 --> 03:29:47.812]  Again, nobody can predict the future.
[03:29:48.192 --> 03:29:49.473]  There are too many wildcards.
[03:29:50.494 --> 03:29:53.556]  Again, the wildcard of Trump being almost assassinated.
[03:29:55.858 --> 03:29:56.999]  The market wildcard.
[03:29:57.679 --> 03:29:59.641]  By the way, when we took a break,
[03:30:00.456 --> 03:30:02.378]  Gold's now up to $2,384 an ounce.
[03:30:02.418 --> 03:30:03.739]  This is the golden year for gold.
[03:30:03.859 --> 03:30:05.801]  When we made the forecast it was $2,041.
[03:30:05.881 --> 03:30:09.524]  Now it's almost $2,400.
[03:30:09.565 --> 03:30:10.005]  The markets
[03:30:28.368 --> 03:30:32.431]  The dot-com bust is a trend that we had forecast now at Trends Journal.
[03:30:32.471 --> 03:30:33.572]  I showed you the magazine.
[03:30:33.612 --> 03:30:34.252]  We did it back in 1999.
[03:30:34.352 --> 03:30:42.278]  AI is real, just like the dot-com was real, but they always speculated in various companies.
[03:30:42.918 --> 03:30:44.139]  They're doing the same thing now.
[03:30:48.802 --> 03:30:55.827]  You can see that there may well be a market crash.
[03:30:55.847 --> 03:30:56.947]  When they're showing the S&P 500,
[03:30:58.516 --> 03:31:09.400]  The S&P stocks, 88% are owned by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street.
[03:31:10.401 --> 03:31:17.603]  America, they call a democracy, a D-U-H, duh, M-O-C-K, mock, R-A-C-Y.
[03:31:18.784 --> 03:31:24.786]  Let's go back to what I just read about all of the money that
[03:31:25.836 --> 03:31:28.437]  Harris just got, what, 81 million bucks?
[03:31:29.537 --> 03:31:34.658]  Look at all the money that Trump got, like 400 million in a couple of days.
[03:31:35.778 --> 03:31:37.779]  You got no money, you can't run for anything.
[03:31:38.259 --> 03:31:40.360]  The robber barons are running America.
[03:31:40.420 --> 03:31:41.560]  Grow up, everybody.
[03:31:42.120 --> 03:31:45.561]  We're nothing more than plantation workers of slavelandia.
[03:31:46.941 --> 03:31:48.982]  The land of opportunity's gone.
[03:31:50.242 --> 03:31:54.223]  And you look at the connections of Harris with Hollywood.
[03:31:55.109 --> 03:31:56.290]  And that's what it is.
[03:31:56.510 --> 03:31:57.511]  It's a show.
[03:31:58.412 --> 03:32:00.874]  It's a presidential reality show.
[03:32:01.255 --> 03:32:07.960]  By the way, we, the Trends Research Institute, own that trademark.
[03:32:09.582 --> 03:32:11.424]  Presidential reality show.
[03:32:12.545 --> 03:32:13.626]  It's been a movie.
[03:32:14.246 --> 03:32:15.827]  They've been playing it out.
[03:32:17.589 --> 03:32:22.033]  And she is really tight with Hollywood.
[03:32:23.356 --> 03:32:31.262]  What, Rahm Emanuel's brother runs that biggest PR agency or whatever, and does with the movies?
[03:32:31.302 --> 03:32:34.525]  Yeah, yeah, that one, the agency for getting jobs, yeah.
[03:32:37.487 --> 03:32:41.350]  Again, Harris comes dancing out, Trump, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.
[03:32:44.492 --> 03:32:46.434]  Entertain the people, you understand?
[03:32:47.495 --> 03:32:48.435]  That's the old saying.
[03:32:48.455 --> 03:32:51.658]  And that's all it is, it's entertainment.
[03:32:56.070 --> 03:32:59.512]  And you go by the numbers.
[03:33:00.853 --> 03:33:09.197]  So going back, what could break it is Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign has raised $200 million.
[03:33:09.237 --> 03:33:09.497]  Wow.
[03:33:10.898 --> 03:33:13.660]  It was $81 million on Thursday, $200 million today.
[03:33:13.680 --> 03:33:19.863]  Again, they call this a democracy.
[03:33:19.883 --> 03:33:20.804]  Who the hell are you kidding?
[03:33:21.524 --> 03:33:24.786]  You can't run for crap if you don't got the dough.
[03:33:26.425 --> 03:33:38.193]  Harris is also making a very smart move on the Israel genocide war, as the International Court of Justice and other call it, and which I agree.
[03:33:40.234 --> 03:33:49.940]  Trump claims Kamala Harris is totally against the Jewish people, as reported by Mediate.
[03:33:52.322 --> 03:33:55.984]  Trump doubles down on criticism of Jews who vote for Democratic Party.
[03:33:59.619 --> 03:34:08.206]  Just to show that Harris is not anti-Jewish, this is from the toilet paper record in New York Times.
[03:34:09.527 --> 03:34:12.750]  Harris's views on Israel now enter the spotlight.
[03:34:13.931 --> 03:34:19.956]  So after reading through this whole thing over here, aides to Ms.
[03:34:19.976 --> 03:34:24.260]  Harris say she's unwavering in her support for Israel.
[03:34:25.899 --> 03:34:30.160]  She has been equally forceful in a condemnation of the October 17th Hamas attack.
[03:34:32.040 --> 03:34:33.041]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:34:37.502 --> 03:34:39.942]  Before October 7th, Ms.
[03:34:39.982 --> 03:34:45.344]  Harris had established a largely uncritical position toward Israel.
[03:34:47.044 --> 03:34:52.125]  Three months after becoming senator in 2017, Ms.
[03:34:52.145 --> 03:34:55.346]  Harris spoke at AIPAC, annual convention.
[03:34:56.781 --> 03:34:59.844]  A role that she called, quote, an honor.
[03:35:01.805 --> 03:35:12.954]  During the address, she boasted that her first act was as senator, was to co-sponsor a resolution condemning
[03:35:13.935 --> 03:35:27.598]  UN Security Council call for Israel to, quote, immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory.
[03:35:28.138 --> 03:35:42.382]  In other words, you could keep stealing the land under the thing that God gave it to you, in violation of the Geneva Convention, Article 242 of the United Nations, and
[03:35:43.174 --> 03:35:50.555]  The latest International Court of Justice to stop stealing this land.
[03:35:53.016 --> 03:35:54.536]  Her husband is Jewish.
[03:35:56.356 --> 03:36:01.457]  She's doing a very, again, it's a reality show.
[03:36:03.397 --> 03:36:10.579]  She came out against what she said was
[03:36:13.217 --> 03:36:15.178]  The terrible things happening to the Palestinians.
[03:36:18.701 --> 03:36:20.082]  You gotta look at the polls.
[03:36:21.143 --> 03:36:22.423]  The polls have shifted.
[03:36:24.725 --> 03:36:28.608]  The majority of American people are against what Israel keeps doing there.
[03:36:30.889 --> 03:36:32.831]  Day after day, it's bombs away.
[03:36:40.116 --> 03:36:41.897]  Some 2 million people are suffering.
[03:36:45.034 --> 03:36:47.055]  She knows how to play the game.
[03:36:48.076 --> 03:36:50.618]  Trump is staying on a one-sided issue.
[03:36:53.520 --> 03:36:57.983]  And the issue is going to cost him as we see it.
[03:37:00.225 --> 03:37:08.971]  This was from the Wall Street Journal on the 25th of this month.
[03:37:09.712 --> 03:37:13.975]  Defiant Netanyahu defends Gaza War to divide
[03:37:14.942 --> 03:37:21.145]  Very important.
[03:37:22.006 --> 03:37:25.347]  Netanyahu displayed his penchant for intervening in U.S.
[03:37:25.387 --> 03:37:35.732]  policies honed over decades, delivering pointed jabs at Democrats and sometimes lavishing praise on Trump.
[03:37:37.633 --> 03:37:43.316]  Americans don't love Netanyahu and that he's lavishing praise on Trump.
[03:37:46.604 --> 03:37:55.527]  He thanked Biden for supporting Israel in its nine month war, but also sought to put the White House on the defensive.
[03:37:56.747 --> 03:38:00.929]  The US quote, to fast track additional weapons shipments.
[03:38:01.289 --> 03:38:03.330]  Yes, we could keep slaughtering innocent people.
[03:38:05.770 --> 03:38:13.293]  He also urged the United States to help counter a growing threat from Iran.
[03:38:15.234 --> 03:38:15.854]  Listen to this.
[03:38:17.222 --> 03:38:18.343]  This is from Netanyahu.
[03:38:19.343 --> 03:38:21.544]  Our enemies are your enemies.
[03:38:22.044 --> 03:38:23.105]  Hey, hey.
[03:38:26.227 --> 03:38:28.027]  Your enemies are not my enemies.
[03:38:28.948 --> 03:38:30.509]  I'm Gerald Salenti.
[03:38:31.789 --> 03:38:32.750]  I'm an American.
[03:38:35.571 --> 03:38:37.532]  How long has this crap been going on?
[03:38:38.573 --> 03:38:39.853]  They're not my enemies.
[03:38:40.514 --> 03:38:41.734]  They're your enemies.
[03:38:42.935 --> 03:38:46.757]  But, hey everybody, swallow the crap.
[03:38:47.461 --> 03:38:48.621]  Swallow the crap!
[03:38:49.042 --> 03:38:50.242]  I'm in Congress!
[03:38:50.862 --> 03:38:53.023]  It's a crap-swapping haul!
[03:38:55.824 --> 03:39:02.527]  He goes on to say, and our victory will be your victory.
[03:39:03.287 --> 03:39:06.248]  Hey, what victory are you talking about?
[03:39:08.090 --> 03:39:09.011]  What is your murder now?
[03:39:09.131 --> 03:39:11.233]  Oh, it's only 40,000 people.
[03:39:11.854 --> 03:39:16.438]  Blew up people's homes, schools, hospitals, destroyed the place!
[03:39:16.779 --> 03:39:17.800]  Oh, you call that a victory?
[03:39:18.060 --> 03:39:18.901]  Yes, Salenti!
[03:39:19.101 --> 03:39:24.146]  Hamas was hiding in every one of them hospitals and schools and everybody's houses!
[03:39:24.466 --> 03:39:27.109]  They're dressed in Hamas costumes and we're killing them!
[03:39:31.957 --> 03:39:33.138]  I'm totally against this.
[03:39:33.579 --> 03:39:34.760]  I'd want to stock up my piece.
[03:39:35.340 --> 03:39:36.742]  Having a major rally here.
[03:39:37.042 --> 03:39:37.983]  Max Blumenthal.
[03:39:38.563 --> 03:39:39.324]  Anya Parampil.
[03:39:40.045 --> 03:39:40.665]  Scott Ritter.
[03:39:41.486 --> 03:39:42.607]  Judge Napolitano.
[03:39:42.988 --> 03:39:43.548]  September 28th.
[03:39:43.568 --> 03:39:45.030]  We're for peace.
[03:39:46.457 --> 03:39:48.738]  Save your Warhawk crap for yourself, man.
[03:39:49.218 --> 03:39:50.539]  Not mine, Netanyahu.
[03:39:51.019 --> 03:39:51.559]  Not mine.
[03:39:51.819 --> 03:39:52.740]  I am an American.
[03:39:53.380 --> 03:39:54.860]  I believe in the Founding Fathers.
[03:39:54.900 --> 03:39:56.001]  No foreign entanglements.
[03:39:56.301 --> 03:39:58.622]  And you got the fairy tale that God gave you this land.
[03:39:58.642 --> 03:39:59.922]  So how far is this going back?
[03:40:00.423 --> 03:40:00.863]  Not mine.
[03:40:01.523 --> 03:40:02.523]  When was our country?
[03:40:03.184 --> 03:40:03.544]  Spirit of 1776?
[03:40:03.664 --> 03:40:11.947]  And you're telling me I gotta go back to ancient history that's made up in Chapter 6, Section 8?
[03:40:13.148 --> 03:40:14.168]  Of somebody's Bible?
[03:40:17.475 --> 03:40:19.996]  Harris is playing the right role in this.
[03:40:20.596 --> 03:40:22.157]  Trump is going the wrong way.
[03:40:23.598 --> 03:40:25.418]  Again, subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[03:40:26.679 --> 03:40:28.240]  The motto is think for yourself.
[03:40:28.280 --> 03:40:30.160]  We don't tell you what to do, what to believe.
[03:40:31.301 --> 03:40:33.562]  Here's what's being reported.
[03:40:33.602 --> 03:40:34.702]  Here's our analysis.
[03:40:35.143 --> 03:40:36.703]  And here's our trend forecasts.
[03:40:38.924 --> 03:40:39.725]  And am I angry?
[03:40:39.785 --> 03:40:40.625]  You bet I am.
[03:40:42.216 --> 03:40:44.337]  I want peace on earth, goodwill to all.
[03:40:44.837 --> 03:40:51.158]  I want life, liberty, and a pursuit of happiness that they stole to us with the COVID war, and only getting worse.
[03:40:53.259 --> 03:40:55.779]  And vote for Mr. Boogie, that's my choice.
[03:40:55.999 --> 03:40:57.280]  Vote for Mr. Boogie.
[03:40:58.000 --> 03:41:03.681]  So number one, you've got central banks now starting to buy it, by the tons, right?
[03:41:03.861 --> 03:41:04.381]  It's a lot.
[03:41:05.101 --> 03:41:11.723]  You've now got Chinese citizens being encouraged to not just buy gold, but buy silver.
[03:41:12.426 --> 03:41:17.448]  Because China and Russia want to destroy the Western banks.
[03:41:17.968 --> 03:41:26.091]  And the Western banks, JPMorgan Chase and HSBC, have the largest number of naked short positions on the planet.
[03:41:26.980 --> 03:41:27.580]  On the planet.
[03:41:27.621 --> 03:41:34.745]  I think between the two of them, they have over 900 million ounces of silver in short position.
[03:41:34.785 --> 03:41:38.327]  Well, only 1.2 billion ounces of silver is mined every year globally.
[03:41:38.367 --> 03:41:42.470]  So they've got almost the entire annual production in a short position.
[03:41:43.010 --> 03:41:49.254]  That means when the price goes up, these banks lose money hand over fist in multiples.
[03:41:49.834 --> 03:41:59.187]  China knows this, which is why they're encouraging all of their citizens now to buy not just gold, but buy silver, because that creates more demand.
[03:41:59.548 --> 03:42:06.197]  Every time silver goes up in price, the Western banks lose money in multiples, because they're on the wrong side of the transaction.
[03:42:06.917 --> 03:42:10.919]  They want to do it to destroy the West and they want to do it to make a financial gain.
[03:42:11.359 --> 03:42:16.141]  Both of those in their minds are legitimate enough reasons to do something, right?
[03:42:16.181 --> 03:42:22.484]  But let's look at silver because that's what we're allocated into right now because the ratio between gold and silver points towards silver.
[03:42:22.524 --> 03:42:23.344]  It's outperforming.
[03:42:24.125 --> 03:42:26.447]  Where were we just four years ago?
[03:42:27.527 --> 03:42:26.447]  1191.
[03:42:28.828 --> 03:42:36.173]  But now since then, we've gone from 1191 to almost 30 in the last four years.
[03:42:36.614 --> 03:42:42.618]  See, the trend is accelerating because the geopolitical dynamics are causing its growth.
[03:42:42.978 --> 03:42:44.719]  It's not just a flight for safety.
[03:42:45.120 --> 03:42:49.843]  It's not just a way to preserve and protect your freedoms and get out of
[03:42:50.541 --> 03:43:00.209]  These unified ledgers and these social credit scoring systems and this digital money, you're getting something tangible that actually doesn't just grow.
[03:43:00.249 --> 03:43:01.170]  It's growing tremendously.
[03:43:01.210 --> 03:43:02.691]  It's up like 40% in four months.
[03:43:02.711 --> 03:43:03.432]  That's amazing.
[03:43:03.892 --> 03:43:06.975]  But you also have something that can maintain your freedoms, Alex.
[03:43:07.015 --> 03:43:11.779]  That's the the tangible intangible, which is as our freedom.
[03:43:11.839 --> 03:43:15.942]  I can't believe we have millions of viewers right now and maybe 500 people call you.
[03:43:16.463 --> 03:43:17.203]  It's a sponsor.
[03:43:17.223 --> 03:43:18.824]  I want to promote what I think is great.
[03:43:19.625 --> 03:43:26.192]  So I sell water filtration systems that have the highest rating for like half the price on average, and I sell high quality supplements.
[03:43:26.292 --> 03:43:27.633]  I just sell stuff that I think is great.
[03:43:28.194 --> 03:43:31.277]  Everybody should call you and get into silver and gold right now.
[03:43:31.658 --> 03:43:33.459]  There's nothing performing as good as it.
[03:43:34.000 --> 03:43:36.082]  I mean, it's like it's like it's on record.
[03:43:36.142 --> 03:43:38.825]  It's the best investment, but the stockbrokers won't tell you that.
[03:43:39.045 --> 03:43:42.608]  The globalist argument is, oh, the world's in turmoil and everything's collapsing.
[03:43:42.628 --> 03:43:46.890]  We've got to be strong and America's got to threaten Russia and China to keep us as the dollar.
[03:43:47.171 --> 03:43:49.172]  But they're the ones that undermine the currency.
[03:43:49.212 --> 03:43:51.854]  They're the ones that brought us into this situation.
[03:43:52.594 --> 03:43:54.576]  And so that's why this is so incredibly dangerous.
[03:43:54.596 --> 03:43:55.737]  This is trying to kill Trump.
[03:43:56.297 --> 03:43:58.078]  Just, what, 10-11 days ago.
[03:43:58.498 --> 03:44:00.660]  They are going for broke.
[03:44:00.780 --> 03:44:03.081]  I wish we weren't in this position, but we are.
[03:44:03.161 --> 03:44:08.965]  But by admitting where we are, we have a real chance of waking up, like Congress saying, we know you tried to kill Trump.
[03:44:09.265 --> 03:44:11.767]  Buying silver is the smartest bet there is.
[03:44:12.127 --> 03:44:14.288]  You'd have bought silver a year ago up 20-30%.
[03:44:14.328 --> 03:44:20.012]  That's what you want, and silver is the big mover in this economy.
[03:44:20.312 --> 03:44:21.173]  So, go now.
[03:44:21.653 --> 03:44:24.314]  The KEPM.com forward slash gold or 720-605-300.
[03:44:24.374 --> 03:44:27.515]  We'll explain it all to you.
[03:44:27.575 --> 03:44:32.037]  Most of the gold and silver companies are charging you huge 30, 40, 50 percent premiums.
[03:44:32.658 --> 03:44:34.638]  And most of the conservative talk show hosts are doing it, too.
[03:44:34.939 --> 03:44:36.899]  And I've talked to a person, I say, you need Kirk Elliott.
[03:44:37.279 --> 03:44:40.741]  What does Goldman Sachs think gold is going to do before the end of the year?
[03:44:41.702 --> 03:44:43.284]  $2,700 an ounce.
[03:44:43.684 --> 03:44:49.352]  And I'm sitting here saying, it funds us, it keeps us on air, and it's the best investment, hands down, in an imperfect world.
[03:44:49.392 --> 03:44:54.478]  I mean, this is, to me, is one of the most important things to protect your financial future ever.
[03:44:54.658 --> 03:44:57.542]  Go now to KEPM.com forward slash gold.
