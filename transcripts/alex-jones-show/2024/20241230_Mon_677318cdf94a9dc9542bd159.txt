[00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:31.850]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:42.250]  It's Monday, December 30th, 2024. We're only 22 days out from the inauguration of President Trump.
[00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:55.049]  And right on time, as we predicted, and as the bad guys began admitting a month ago, they're rolling out the official bird flu hysteria.
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.140]  Now, here's the good news.
[00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:14.000]  People are way more aware and awake than they were five years ago the last time they rolled out this Global Disease X in the UN's own admission as a plan to set up their corporate world government and their cashless society attached to the vaccine passport.
[00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.569]  System for the social credit score.
[00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:33.310]  And just two weeks ago, they tried to pass the pandemic legislation in the big spending bill that mirrored the UN treaty that also failed this year to give them draconian powers for lockdowns, forced injections, forced masking,
[00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.230]  total liability protection for their poison shots.
[00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.349]  That failed.
[00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:44.060]  And they tried lockdowns last year, if you remember, but we got ahead of it and Trump said they're doing this ahead of the election to try to steal it.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.400]  So they're gonna have mail-in ballots.
[00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.560]  There was major political, cultural pressure.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.840]  They had to back off of that.
[00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.739]  But this time they are coming in harder than ever.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:09.379]  So if we expose the past fraud and the current fraud about to lay out, we don't have just a very good chance of stopping this huge PSYOP. We will stop it, but this is meant to block Not just the American awakening of populism and the Great Awakening, but the global Great Awakening.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.780]  And the usual suspects are out there pushing the lies.
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.020]  We're about to break it all down right now.
[00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:21.240]  We have some big picture stuff coming down the pike starting on January 21st.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.599]  Mr. Bloomberg mentioned H5N1. That I'm really worried about.
[00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:31.300]  It's all over wild birds on the western part of the United States and going up in the north.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.639]  It's getting into the poultry.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.539]  You can see that they're monitoring more than 10,000 exposures, but they've only tested 530. What does that mean?
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.199]  That means we're not testing enough.
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.020]  And we know from other viruses that a lot of the spread can be asymptomatic.
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:56.919]  And I think the Biden administration in the remaining days should get testing and vaccines widely available so that at least it empowers state and local health officials and clinicians to do the right thing for their patients.
[00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.819]  All that's going to come crashing down on January 21st on the Trump administration.
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.340]  We need a really, really good team to be able to handle this.
[00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:13.419]  Deborah Birx, Lena Nguyen, Peter Hotez, all the usual suspects right out of Fauci's operation.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.439]  are all over television telling us This new bird flu is here.
[00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.520]  It could mutate any minute and just destroy us all, but don't you worry.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:41.500]  The Biden administration over the last year has spent hundreds and millions of dollars going out to all these different so-called vaccine makers, including Moderna, with an mRNA experimental gene therapy, and a whole bunch of other foreign countries are developing mRNA for the bird flu,
[00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:59.490]  and that they're gonna have it ready for you, and now we have Burks and Wynn and all the usual suspects saying we need emergency authorization From the FDA right now for these stockpiles of so-called vaccines they've made,
[00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:18.069]  there's more than 10 different companies that I just looked up this morning that are doing it, to then rush these directly untested to the public when the mainline science on its face shows that if you don't have the exact mutation of whatever they say the bird flu is gonna mutate into,
[00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:29.459]  the shot doesn't just not protect you, but it causes what they call A leaky vaccine or accelerated evolution or mutation.
[00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:38.040]  When you give people these different experimental shots, supposedly suppressing those viruses, it makes them mutate faster.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:46.199]  And we've got scientists and experts and researchers and doctors coming on throughout the week to be talking about that on my show.
[00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.199]  But you can just look up leaky vaccines for yourself.
[00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:50.839]  It's kind of a non-threatening name.
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.839]  Oh, it's just a leaky vaccine.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.459]  No, it means it makes new mutations that are worse, which is what they're warning us the bird flu is about to do.
[00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:03.079]  This new H5, you know, N1 and all the rest of this.
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.459]  So any basic science, any basic research of this shows you how crazy it is.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.920]  We're about to lay out some of the history of these fearmongers, what they're doing now and how we stop them.
[00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:20.740]  We are unified by our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:25.839]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of intermention.
[00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:32.439]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:35.680]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.300]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.279]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.000]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:52.360]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the new world order and BlackRock.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.860]  They've declared war on us and we accept the challenge.
[00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.810]  AlexJones.network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:15.089]  The globalist COVID tyrants are making their move again, but this time the people of the world are awake and are standing up against it.
[00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:27.529]  The last five years of their criminal power grab has already blown up in their face, but they're so desperate they have no other moves to make and are trying to run the same play again.
[00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:34.329]  This is going to be their Waterloo if we get the facts and raise the alarm to the people of the world now.
[00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:48.040]  Don't forget, this point's got to be made over and over again.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:07:05.629]  Just two weeks ago, they tried in the big spending bill to add Draconian civil emergency martial law provisions for a new pandemic and tens of billions of dollars more to fund their operations.
[00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:17.110]  That failed because the public is awake and because Trump supporters and Elon Musk and our listeners and others put pressure on them and shot down the legislation.
[00:07:17.329 --> 00:07:19.170]  The UN global treaty has failed.
[00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:31.790]  They've come out and said, don't worry, a new pandemic's coming, Bill Gates, Hotez, all of them, and that will teach you to get in line and do what they say.
[00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:36.750]  What did Trump do last year when I raised the alarm and when this great audience of activists raised the alarm?
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.339]  About them trying to roll out the impox, the new monkey pox, the bird for the rest of it.
[00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:44.160]  We said we've got to get ahead of this and expose it.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.759]  Trump came out and said they're doing this so they can have mail-in ballots coming to the election.
[00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:49.959]  We exposed it.
[00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:51.439]  It failed.
[00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:53.180]  So we attacked the PCR test.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:53.779]  It's a fraud.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.779]  Notice Berks was on national TV saying we've got to have the PCR test.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.000]  You know, we've got to create the fear.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.660]  You've got to go out and test people and claim it's jumped to humans.
[00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:07.959]  It's preposterous how obvious all of this is.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:18.500]  And that's why I've said they've got to go to prison, not just for the millions that died from the poison shot, the millions that died around the world for lack of medical care, but so this same group of criminals can't do this again.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:27.819]  The UN documents came out decades ago that they would use the threat of a pandemic to bring in world government and have it six feet apart and wearing masks and forced injections and quarantine centers.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:40.899]  They've built Under UN auspices, all these emergency pandemic camps around the world, this is their smokescreen for global totalitarianism to stop the global awakening.
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:46.299]  So we don't just call for saying no to this new hysteria and fear and stopping the new emergencies is declaring.
[00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:52.080]  We also demand prosecution of Fauci and the rest of them, and their whole house of cards will collapse.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.500]  It's us or them.
[00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:59.960]  We have some big picture stuff coming down the pike starting on January 21st.
[00:09:00.379 --> 00:09:04.340]  Mr. Bloomberg mentioned H5N1. That I'm really worried about.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:10.019]  It's all over wild birds on the western part of the United States and going up in the north.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.399]  It's getting into the poultry.
[00:09:11.539 --> 00:09:14.000]  We're seeing sporadic human cases.
[00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:17.139]  No human-to-human transmission yet, but that could happen.
[00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:17.940]  It's in the cattle.
[00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:18.700]  It's in the milk.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.100]  And that's just the beginning.
[00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:23.980]  We have another major coronavirus likely brewing in Asia.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:33.700]  We've had SARS in 2002, SARS-2, COVID-19 in 2019. And we know these viruses are jumping from bats to people thousands of times a year.
[00:09:34.029 --> 00:09:35.470]  But there's still more.
[00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:50.590]  We know that we have a big problem with mosquito-transmitted viruses all along the Gulf Coast, where I am here in Texas, or expecting dengue and possibly Zika virus coming back, or apuche virus, maybe even yellow fever.
[00:09:50.789 --> 00:09:51.629]  And there's more.
[00:09:51.809 --> 00:10:00.879]  Then we have all this sharp rise in vaccine-preventable Diseases going up because of, in part, the anti-vaccine activism that's so prominent right now.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.059]  We have a five-fold rise in pertussis cases, whooping cough over the last year, 15 measles outbreaks this year.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.399]  We've got polio that's been in the wastewater in New York State.
[00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:15.639]  All that's going to come crashing down on January 21st on the Trump administration.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.159]  We need a really, really good team to be able to handle this.
[00:10:20.379 --> 00:10:24.000]  Vaccine-driven viral evolution.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.879]  Or the common term leaky vaccine.
[00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:30.659]  That's the most important point.
[00:10:31.409 --> 00:10:35.309]  More important than the fact that the globalists admitted they'd use these viruses to take full control.
[00:10:35.649 --> 00:10:51.370]  Even more important than them being caught in all these previous lies and being total frauds in their own documents coming out, not just here, but around the world, health agencies coordinating to hype, fear, lie to the public, not treat people sick from other viruses so they die to add to those death numbers.
[00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.769]  That's all key.
[00:10:53.070 --> 00:11:08.679]  But most important is the fact that you give people During the big virus season, during winter, a bunch of experimental shots, it is on record that it causes not just the virus they're targeting,
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:14.360]  but many other coronaviruses, flu viruses, you name it, to be put under pressure in the body.
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:24.779]  And then that causes these dangerous mutations, which they're telling us is about to happen and make it jump into humans even easier.
[00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:26.720]  So why would you then have...
[00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:43.279]  10 companies in the US, dozens around the world, so many I can't even count them all, all coming out with their own bird flu shots, but having no idea what it's about to mutate into unless they already have it on the shelf at these bioweapon labs like EcoHealth Alliance and others,
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:49.139]  so that when the new variant shows up, don't worry, they've already got the so-called vaccine on the shelf.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.799]  This is really important information.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:00.500]  We've got scientists, doctors, researchers coming on today and throughout the week on my show.
[00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:04.120]  Follow us at RealAlexJones as we break this down.
[00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:08.820]  But it's really important to attack the credibility of these people and to point out the science.
[00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:13.169]  Science is about asking questions, not about Fauci saying, I am the science.
[00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:14.570]  Don't ask questions.
[00:12:14.789 --> 00:12:23.370]  This is a globalist eugenics death cult led by Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab that wants to depopulate the earth and wants full control over our bodies.
[00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:31.950]  This is an existential threat to everyone, and these criminals must go down before they release the next manufactured virus.
[00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:36.110]  What should be happening in the Biden administration right now that isn't going on?
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.120]  Yeah, there are two main things that they should be doing in the days that they have left.
[00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:42.419]  The first is to get testing out there.
[00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:48.600]  I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that just because we aren't testing, it doesn't mean that the virus isn't there.
[00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:50.320]  It just means that we aren't looking for it.
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:13:03.299]  We should be having rapid tests, home tests available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not.
[00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:08.809]  And the second very important thing is this is not like the beginning of COVID where we were dealing with a new virus.
[00:13:08.929 --> 00:13:09.830]  We didn't have a vaccine.
[00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:19.909]  There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1. The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses of the vaccine.
[00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.870]  However, they have not asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine.
[00:13:24.049 --> 00:13:25.289]  There's research done on it.
[00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:31.529]  They could get this authorized now and also get the vaccine out and to farm workers and to vulnerable people.
[00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:36.669]  I think that's the right approach because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu.
[00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:41.870]  If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization?
[00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:47.269]  If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing?
[00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.429]  I mean, that's a possibility.
[00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:58.049]  The spring and the summer where we had all of the dairy cattle to farm worker exposure, we didn't have human flu circulating.
[00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:03.990]  So now we're entering a much more dangerous period, yet we're still not testing.
[00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:12.169]  And we should be providing tests free of charge to dairy farm workers so they can test anonymously weekly because they'll want to know.
[00:14:12.809 --> 00:14:19.070]  If they have both cases of potential flus co-circulating in their own body to protect their families.
[00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:20.129]  People are very smart.
[00:14:20.289 --> 00:14:22.789]  I find the American public to be incredibly smart.
[00:14:22.789 --> 00:14:29.710]  If you tell them the risk and you give them the tools, they will utilize them to protect themselves and their family.
[00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:37.629]  We told you that the globalists were going to launch a new plandemic, a new psychological warfare operation, a new hysteria.
[00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:41.529]  President Trump needs to get out ahead of this right now.
[00:14:41.929 --> 00:14:43.929]  He needs to expose these frauds.
[00:14:44.029 --> 00:14:46.789]  It is meant to kill the economy again.
[00:14:46.789 --> 00:14:53.929]  It is meant to take control of not just America's political policies, but the world's.
[00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:55.490]  This is the big move.
[00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:57.149]  Do you want the mask back on the kids?
[00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.450]  Do you want the lockdowns?
[00:14:58.509 --> 00:15:05.309]  Do you want them to have all these COVID centers around the world, not just filled with people they claim failed a PCR test, but political dissidents.
[00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:06.370]  That's the plan.
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.419]  Schmidt, the head of alphabet.
[00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:16.539]  Of Google has come out and said he wants NATO and the UN to censor and arrest people during the next pandemic.
[00:15:16.759 --> 00:15:18.299]  He said that a few months ago at Stanford.
[00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:19.799]  They are gearing up.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.200]  They are making their move.
[00:15:21.419 --> 00:15:22.860]  This is the big assault.
[00:15:23.299 --> 00:15:29.159]  This is their plan to derail the great awakening and continue their great reset.
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.360]  President Trump must come out and speak out against this now.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.879]  But regardless of what he does, we have to come out and speak out about it right now and expose these criminals.
[00:15:40.149 --> 00:15:45.950]  Remember the horses running over people in Australia, Germany, Canada, who were out protesting the lockdowns.
[00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:47.570]  Remember all the tyranny.
[00:15:47.769 --> 00:15:50.470]  Remember the children cheering when they finally took the mask off.
[00:15:50.669 --> 00:15:56.289]  Remember the third world collapsing and tens of millions starving to death, not from the virus, but from the lockdowns from the virus.
[00:15:56.629 --> 00:16:01.210]  This is global government trying to take over our lives with the fear of a virus.
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.919]  Then their response are these poison shots that destroy our immune systems.
[00:16:05.159 --> 00:16:07.519]  This is globalist tyranny.
[00:16:07.659 --> 00:16:09.940]  This is phase two of their genocide.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:15.779]  And we the people in the information war with the truth must rally with the facts and stop them now.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.539]  It's us or them.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host today on The Alex Jones Show.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:37.559]  We've got amazing guests joining us, including Dr. Peter McCullough in just a few minutes, as well as Thomas Renz at 1 o'clock Central Time, and more reports from Alex Jones throughout this crucial, critical broadcast.
[00:16:37.799 --> 00:16:44.500]  Now, I've been doing a lot of research on this bird flu, this H5N1. I've got stack after stack after stack.
[00:16:45.409 --> 00:16:47.090]  I've got all the headlines covering it.
[00:16:47.169 --> 00:16:49.009]  I've got WHO documents.
[00:16:49.169 --> 00:16:50.370]  I've got CDC documents.
[00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.029]  And I've got analysis.
[00:16:53.129 --> 00:17:05.589]  And the most alarming thing to me about it is that it's coming in conjunction with what we've seen in the way of poultry farm fires the last four years.
[00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.369]  Now, I did some research on ChatGPT.
[00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:21.559]  And over the course of the last four years, We have seen a 200% increase in poultry farm fires, chicken farm fires, compared to the prior four years.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.900]  It's approximately 1.5 million chickens have gone up in flames spontaneously.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:36.119]  Maybe you've seen the videos, I've put together compilations of poultry farm after poultry farm after poultry farm spontaneously going up in flames for reasons totally unknown.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:43.740]  And I'm looking at all these details of this bird flu, this H5N1 virus.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:51.720]  And all the experts have been saying that you can really only get it if you're in close contact with infected poultry.
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:18:00.279]  So farmers are at the highest risk, but they're worried about shocking and alarming mutations that would allow human to human transfer of the virus.
[00:18:01.529 --> 00:18:05.609]  Now we know with COVID-19 they exaggerated the virus itself.
[00:18:05.609 --> 00:18:07.750]  We know that it was manufactured in a Wuhan lab.
[00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:20.809]  We know that they used the exaggeration of this virus and the deaths associated with it in order to justify expediting vaccine development and then force inoculation for the American people and the people of the world.
[00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:29.329]  And that they used it not just to do that, but to shut down the entire economy unnecessarily, to force you to wear a mask that didn't work, to social distance when it didn't work.
[00:18:29.349 --> 00:18:35.869]  We've got compilation videos as well of Police brutality over the course of the pandemic when people violated these so-called rules.
[00:18:38.089 --> 00:18:43.849]  And they did all of that in an effort to undermine Trump's campaign in 2020 and ensure that he wouldn't be elected.
[00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:52.730]  They used it as an excuse to change the laws at the state levels to ensure that voter fraud was as easy as possible.
[00:18:54.289 --> 00:19:15.230]  So coming out of this 2020 pandemic, this COVID-19 pandemic, when there were so many lies, so much In the way of bad policy and bad responses, it's hard to believe anything that you hear from the CDC or the WHO or mainstream media pundits or leftists or government bureaucrats about this bird flu.
[00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.990]  And frankly, I think skepticism here is warranted, to say the least.
[00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.490]  I think it's totally a hoax, totally exaggerated.
[00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:38.269]  I mean, if we look at the details of the history of this H5N1 virus, which is the bird flu, it was first identified in 1961. First human infection was in 1997 in Hong Kong.
[00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.470]  Human transmission, human-to-human transmission, still not possible.
[00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.990]  But if you get it, there's a 50% chance, 52% chance.
[00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.210]  It ranges from 50% to 60% chance that you die.
[00:19:52.369 --> 00:19:59.470]  And so they're trying to alarm the public again in the same way that they did in 2020 about this virus, which isn't even a problem.
[00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:08.569]  There was a case in Louisiana and Gavin Newsom uses an excuse to establish a state of emergency in California.
[00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:15.269]  But just like they do with climate change, they're doing with this bird flu because they want to alarm you.
[00:20:15.349 --> 00:20:23.029]  But my concern is that it's more Than just about instituting more lockdowns, of course they'll do that.
[00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.730]  Instituting more social distancing, of course they'll do that.
[00:20:27.089 --> 00:20:30.150]  Instituting more mask mandates, of course they'll do that too.
[00:20:30.349 --> 00:20:37.769]  But the fact that it's linked directly to our food supply in a way that COVID-19 wasn't is very alarming to me.
[00:20:39.769 --> 00:20:45.150]  We've talked for years on this network about orchestrated and manufactured food shortages, food crises.
[00:20:45.349 --> 00:20:51.450]  We showed you clip after clip of the Klaus Schwab's and the Bill Gates's of the world talking about the importance of artificial meat.
[00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:57.710]  Because after all, the cattle, the cows are responsible for 6% of all methane going into the atmosphere.
[00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:06.670]  We showed you stills and videos of these bags hooked up to the cows to capture the methane in an environmentally sustainable way.
[00:21:08.259 --> 00:21:15.880]  But the fact that this bird flu is being linked directly to our food supply is another level of terrifying to me.
[00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:21.059]  Now, I've got reports here from the WHO back in October.
[00:21:21.059 --> 00:21:26.700]  I've got reports from the CDC where they were saying this spring that the risk of bird flu was incredibly low.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.660]  Now, all of a sudden, it's a huge problem.
[00:21:29.319 --> 00:21:36.039]  This in the context of HOTES coming out and saying there was going to be another pandemic on January 21st as soon as Donald Trump is inaugurated.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:44.180]  And he listed a litany of different viruses that could be the source of this pandemic, the cause of this pandemic.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:50.319]  But they've been prepping us psychologically for months now, if not years, for the next pandemic.
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:22:03.500]  Again, the Fauci's, the Klaus Schwab's, other experts in the field, pundits on mainstream media outlets trying to strike fear into the hearts of the American people so they can hand over all their liberties and comply with any mandates.
[00:22:06.369 --> 00:22:15.029]  But we understand throughout history that the more desperate a people are, the more willing they are to give up their liberties, their values and their principles for the sake of a little bit of relief.
[00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:35.650]  And if this bird flu hoax really does succeed in striking fear into the American people in a meaningful way, then it's not going to be just lockdowns.
[00:22:36.359 --> 00:22:40.539]  It's gonna be the destruction of swaths of our cattle.
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.619]  Whether it's dairy, remember they don't want you eating raw milk.
[00:22:44.779 --> 00:22:47.900]  There's an egg shortage right now in California because of the bird flu crisis.
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:56.039]  They'll eradicate all the chickens and they'll use this as an excuse to manufacture artificial meat and food so they can totally control the food supply.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.099]  So I'm very concerned about what this means.
[00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:06.970]  For the next several years for the Trump administration, if they succeed in doing this, we have to do everything that we can to stop this from happening.
[00:23:07.809 --> 00:23:10.250]  In fact, I wanna play clip number 57 here.
[00:23:10.329 --> 00:23:14.549]  This is a clip about the California executive order, state of emergency.
[00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:15.069]  Let's watch.
[00:23:17.769 --> 00:23:27.029]  Let's talk about this executive order, though, cuz I read it yesterday, and it, man, the red flags went up everywhere.
[00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:36.829]  The way that it is written, It is written to allow for the government to come onto your farm in hazmat suits.
[00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:44.690]  It gives them the ability- Well, it restricts movement of herds.
[00:23:46.489 --> 00:23:49.630]  It restricts sale of product.
[00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:53.529]  It allows for the government to access your facility.
[00:23:54.410 --> 00:24:04.089]  It requires all kinds of the pandemic safety protocols to be adhered to, or you could lose your license, your whole business.
[00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:13.710]  It also, there's parts of it that talk about managing the herds, if necessary, culling them.
[00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.750]  I mean, there's suggestions around that as well.
[00:24:16.869 --> 00:24:20.849]  I mean, this is, the executive order is nutty.
[00:24:21.109 --> 00:24:23.349]  It's such an executive overreach.
[00:24:23.869 --> 00:24:26.809]  Well, the dairymen are recovering from this.
[00:24:27.009 --> 00:24:34.170]  They have a acute phase of maybe the first 15, 18 days where some cows are lost production and they're not feeling well, but then they recover.
[00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:43.650]  And so as this wave of virus goes across California and dairies recover, I don't think the dairymen are going to be very happy about anybody coming on their farm and doing anything.
[00:24:43.769 --> 00:24:45.150]  I'm not talking about just raw milk dairymen.
[00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.509]  I'm talking about the pasteurized guys.
[00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:54.630]  Because to them, except for that very acute phase where they're taking care of just 10% of the herd that's not feeling well, everything's status quo normal.
[00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.849]  My good friend Steve Maddox is just south of us nine miles here.
[00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.789]  He's fully recovered now after having the episode go through, and everything's going fine.
[00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:11.029]  So there's no crisis, except maybe California wanting more money to put in this effort in terms of what they're doing administratively.
[00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:13.349]  But there's no crisis on the farms, per se.
[00:25:13.849 --> 00:25:14.849]  Everything's normal.
[00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:22.009]  I don't even know how many articles I have on the desk right now about this from mainstream outlets.
[00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:30.390]  And it's interesting, I was particularly frustrated today because typically I exclusively focus on articles published on Infowars.com whenever I host a show.
[00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:36.430]  But today I wanted more articles specifically about this pandemic, this bird flu.
[00:25:36.609 --> 00:25:44.089]  So I went to other mainstream media outlets and I was appalled to see the level of psychological operation that is being conducted on the American people.
[00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:50.710]  We've got Dr. Liana Nguyen saying that the Biden regime needs to get millions of people vaccinated.
[00:25:51.009 --> 00:25:56.410]  We've got Klaus Schwab coming out and saying that climate change is going to be the next major problem.
[00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:00.509]  We've got scam after scam.
[00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:03.710]  Bird flu outbreak hits Sweet Marsh public wetland.
[00:26:03.829 --> 00:26:05.549]  Bird flu impacting California's egg supply.
[00:26:05.849 --> 00:26:10.250]  What to know as the CDC finds concerning mutations in the bird flu?
[00:26:10.349 --> 00:26:14.849]  I mean, it's just headline after headline trying to spark terror in the hearts of the American people and the people of the world.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.740]  But I'm looking at the data here.
[00:26:18.299 --> 00:26:18.960]  Overhead cam.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:26.599]  This is from the World Health Organization on October 25th, 2024. One day before Hillary Clinton's birthday.
[00:26:27.539 --> 00:26:29.039]  I think Bill might have gotten the flu.
[00:26:29.339 --> 00:26:44.480]  And if you zoom in on it here, this has all of the instances of human cases of H5N1 since 2003. So from 2003 to 2009, there were 161 cases with 91 deaths.
[00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:45.359]  That's a six-year period.
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:54.539]  But from 2010 to 2014, there were 71 cases, 42 deaths, obviously a high mortality rate.
[00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:06.230]  In the last four years, so if we compare 2010 and 2014 to 2020 through 2024, there have only been 23 cases as of October.
[00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:09.569]  Now, there's probably been more since October, but a nominal amount.
[00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:18.029]  So we're talking about a period 14 years ago where three times the number of people got this exact bird flu.
[00:27:20.319 --> 00:27:21.980]  Than I've had it in the last four years.
[00:27:22.259 --> 00:27:25.660]  But somehow, all of a sudden, it's a major issue.
[00:27:25.799 --> 00:27:26.660]  It's a major risk.
[00:27:26.839 --> 00:27:36.799]  We've got the state of California declaring a state of emergency where they can authorize state officials to come onto farms in hazmat suits and cull herds of private farmers on their private property.
[00:27:38.589 --> 00:27:44.910]  We cannot let them get away with another plandemic, with another hoax, with another exaggerated threat.
[00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:59.750]  No wonder they tried to pass that terrible $1.2 trillion omnibus bill just a couple of weeks ago that was going to authorize the federal government to have expanded powers compared to the last pandemic because this one has been in the books planned for months, if not years.
[00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:01.970]  Folks, more on the other side with Dr. Peter McCullough.
[00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:09.950]  The globalist, black rock, New World Order criminals want to make you poor and they want to make you sick.
[00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:11.430]  It's in their own admissions.
[00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:19.210]  Well, in any real revolution against tyranny, it is critical that we be independent and that we have the power of free speech.
[00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:25.069]  I'm bringing you the ultimate win-win or 360 win or non-zero-sum game.

[00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.130]  The globalists want you poor.
[00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:06.069]  They want you unhealthy.
[00:29:06.289 --> 00:29:07.529]  They want us isolated.
[00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:10.809]  They don't want all this Patriot apparel out there so we realize how strong we are.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.599]  And so we don't meet like-minded people.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.279]  This thing is so exciting.
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:19.819]  I was sitting here before I started taping this announcement, and I was thinking, how do I hype this enough?
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:25.539]  If people get excited about this, if folks take action with this information, it's incredible.
[00:29:25.799 --> 00:29:31.980]  And the folks who are doing it with, our great sponsor, TheElectionStore.com, have done this with other talk shows, and it's been extremely successful.

[00:30:06.509 --> 00:30:08.490]  This segment, I'm joined by Dr. Peter McCullough.
[00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:18.150]  Dr. Peter McCullough is an internist, cardiologist, epidemiologist, managing the cardiovascular complications of both the viral infection and the injuries developing after the COVID-19 vaccine in Dallas, Texas.
[00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.329]  He's got 51 peer-reviewed publications.
[00:30:20.329 --> 00:30:21.670]  You've seen him before on the network.
[00:30:21.809 --> 00:30:22.630]  He's an American hero.
[00:30:22.869 --> 00:30:25.769]  It's an honor and a pleasure, Dr. McCullough, to be with you today.
[00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:27.690]  Thank you.
[00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:42.319]  So, what are your thoughts about this H5N1? You know, bird flu or H5N1 influenza has been around for over a hundred years, well documented in the scientific literature in the United States.
[00:30:42.539 --> 00:30:57.619]  The most recent outbreak, which is now four years old, we've published, McCullough Foundation has published with first author Nick Holscher, an epidemiologist in the journal Poultry, Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences, peer-reviewed journal,
[00:30:57.819 --> 00:31:08.630]  that the current strain of bird flu It is a product of gain-of-function research done in the USDA Poultry Research Laboratory in Athens, Georgia.
[00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:14.670]  So it is a man-made problem that our farms are experiencing right now.
[00:31:14.849 --> 00:31:27.950]  It's in the peer-reviewed literature, and it's really, you know, the next steps in this outbreak is for people to understand, you know, the ramifications of it personally and how to be prepared.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:36.019]  Well, obviously, all the evidence is overwhelming that the COVID-19 virus was a product of gain-of-function research.
[00:31:36.119 --> 00:31:37.279]  Wuhan lab, it's come out.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:43.539]  I mean, there's so many whistleblowers, various scientists that are very reputable that have analyzed the genetic makeup of the virus.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.559]  Everybody knows that that was the instance.
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.980]  Now, this is the first time I'm hearing this.
[00:31:47.019 --> 00:31:50.319]  I do totally believe you, because after all, you are the expert here, and I trust you.
[00:31:50.539 --> 00:31:54.200]  But this is the first that I've heard that the bird flu is a product of gain-of-function.
[00:31:54.339 --> 00:32:20.390]  Now, based on the research that I've done, And this is just with ChatGPT and basic Google research, so I believe you that it's over 100 years old, but I'm seeing that the first instance of it was discovered in 1961 in South Africa, and then there was a human instance of it in Hong Kong in 1997. So is this current form of H5N1 of a different genetic makeup than what we would have discovered or studied in a lab in the 60s?
[00:32:22.059 --> 00:32:22.799]  It is.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:38.720]  Circulating clade, which is kind of the original source strain, is clade 2344B. And again, that is a product of what's called serial passage gain-of-function research done at the USDA Poultry Research Laboratory.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:45.819]  It was assisted by University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine and Rotterdam University.
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:54.400]  The gain-of-function was to get it to spread from chickens Into migratory waterfowl or mallard ducks.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.380]  And so that's how it's spreading across the world now.
[00:32:57.539 --> 00:32:58.759]  It's been spreading for four years.
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:10.000]  It continually reinfects the farms because the mallard ducks fly around and they land in ponds on farms and they easily infect the other animals on the farm.
[00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:15.980]  So it was able to, in a sense, expand the host range even into cattle and to sea mammals.
[00:33:16.259 --> 00:33:22.670]  Now the good news is it's much milder than bird flu of decades ago.
[00:33:22.829 --> 00:33:26.009]  And there's the peer-reviewed paper by Nick Kulsher on this.
[00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:32.309]  And this has not been denied by the USDA Poultry Research Center.
[00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:40.890]  McCullough Foundation attended the bird flu summits in both University of Arkansas as well as in Washington, D.C. So there's no denial of this.
[00:33:41.049 --> 00:33:49.309]  Just like COVID-19, the bird flu problem is a man-made problem by the U.S. government.
[00:33:50.279 --> 00:34:06.119]  Now, it makes sense to me from a military research or national security viewpoint that obviously if you have a flu that affects certain herds or cattle or groups of animals like poultry, farms are oftentimes very isolated.
[00:34:06.319 --> 00:34:08.460]  You might have a chicken coop here and another one for 100 miles, right?
[00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:14.440]  And so if something happens in one group, it could be isolated to that until the group's dead or it goes away.
[00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:25.920]  But by doing gain-of-function research, you can actually Have something spread from herd to herd or group to group all over any geographic area or expansive area.
[00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:39.360]  So from a national security perspective or a military perspective, if we wanted to do research on a bioweapon, for example, that could eradicate all of the poultry in China in the event of World War III if we wanted to undermine their food supply, I guess that makes sense.
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:43.880]  But my question for you is, why would we be doing that kind of research here in the United States?
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:49.079]  Why are we doing gain-of-function research on viruses that infect chickens?
[00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:58.030]  It's called Dual Purpose Research on Pathogens of Pandemic Potential.
[00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:00.670]  That's the official government name for this.
[00:35:00.969 --> 00:35:16.170]  And the Biden administration put out guidance in May of 2024 that's very loose, saying as long as there's two purposes, we can create a more dangerous, more transmissible pathogen, provided there's a secondary purpose, that is,
[00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:24.619]  to develop a vaccine or to study some other So-called countermeasure therapy, for instance.
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:36.119]  The stated goal of the USDA in doing this research was simply to get it to jump from chickens into mallard ducks and that way it could spread all over.
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:55.610]  So it's a bad line of thinking To continue to do gain-of-function research, and I hope under the new administration, one of the very first steps taken by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the CDC, and the NIH, would be to do an all-out ban on gain-of-function research,
[00:35:55.909 --> 00:36:12.840]  certainly in U.S. labs and our funding of labs outside the United States, because we know it's not just the government that funds this research, but also Gates Foundation, many other pro-vaccine foundations, Are ramping up gain of function research.
[00:36:13.139 --> 00:36:21.460]  Even in the initial spending bill that the US House of Representatives had that Mike Johnson initially presented, there were 12 more US biolabs proposed.
[00:36:22.679 --> 00:36:27.880]  So from your perspective, is this an act of malice or incompetence?
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.800]  I mean, is this just an instance of the government not knowing what it's doing?
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:34.699]  Or is there an intentional malicious nature to this gain of function research?
[00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:52.769]  You know, the overall design of the research in terms of getting the viruses to do way more than what they would do in nature in many ways, I think, is viewed by those doing the work as a scientific achievement.
[00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:56.110]  The incompetence is the lab leaks.
[00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.869]  Now, it turns out that lab leaks are numerous.
[00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:09.099]  And once we start working with animals, particularly mallard ducks, which can escape and fly around, Now, of interest, we have not had large numbers of animals die.
[00:37:09.239 --> 00:37:11.739]  I attended the University of Arkansas Bird Flu Summit.
[00:37:12.019 --> 00:37:18.699]  The estimate is only about 10,000 chickens have died in the last four years of bird flu.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:27.619]  However, tens of millions of chickens have been intentionally culled or killed as a biosecurity measure.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:32.619]  So you can see the biosecurity measures taken are far worse than the disease itself.
[00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:35.889]  The mallard ducks are developing natural immunity.
[00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:41.829]  The farms in cattle and chickens that have not been culled, they develop natural immunity.
[00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:49.429]  And just like in decades before, the answer to bird flu is to allow animal natural immunity.
[00:37:51.489 --> 00:38:02.650]  One thing I noticed in my research, I compared the number of spontaneous accidental poultry farm fires over the course of the last four years to the previous four years.
[00:38:02.789 --> 00:38:08.949]  Now from 2016 to 2020, about 500,000 or so chickens died in poultry farm fires.
[00:38:09.369 --> 00:38:12.170]  2020 to 2024, it's about 1.5 million.
[00:38:12.449 --> 00:38:16.150]  So we've seen a 200% increase in spontaneous fires of these poultry farms.
[00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:18.610]  Is this in any way connected to the culling measures that are being taken?
[00:38:20.869 --> 00:38:32.289]  I can't possibly know, but it's going in the same direction and the direction is that consumers will notice that the price of poultry and particularly the price of eggs has skyrocketed.
[00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:36.750]  These factors that you've outlined have constrained the US food supply.
[00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:41.449]  So I wanna talk a little bit about leaky viruses and please pardon my ignorance.
[00:38:41.449 --> 00:38:43.610]  I'm not an expert in medical things.
[00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:46.889]  I'm just somebody who can research a little bit on my own and try to understand things.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:58.679]  I know that some virologists have been critical of vaccinating during a pandemic because it can create mutations that make viruses resilient to the vaccines and more infectious.
[00:38:59.059 --> 00:39:08.889]  Now we've seen advocates, whether it's Yan or this Ursula person come out and say that we've already got a vaccine for the bird flu.
[00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:10.610]  There's 5 million of them.
[00:39:10.809 --> 00:39:18.269]  We're just waiting on the Biden administration to approve giving them to at least the farmers to prevent them from getting this bird flu.
[00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:24.389]  What are your thoughts as a scientist, as a doctor on vaccinating for this bird flu at the state that we're in?
[00:39:26.429 --> 00:39:30.710]  Vaccinating either humans or poultry for bird flu is a giant mistake.
[00:39:30.849 --> 00:39:37.309]  And this is the reason why In China, they've actually tried vaccinating the poultry now for about two decades.
[00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:38.289]  It's backfired.
[00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.829]  It's made the virus spread even more.
[00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:46.550]  The vaccines are not sterilized, and so the animals can be vaccinated and carry the virus.
[00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:48.489]  The same thing is true in humans.
[00:39:48.849 --> 00:40:03.340]  Now, in 2021, the FDA did approve the CSL sequarius antigen-based flu vaccine, but we've carefully looked at the package insert, and there were far more deaths in normal human volunteers who took this Bird flu vaccine.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.639]  They took it voluntarily to be in the clinical trial.
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.019]  Then placebo.
[00:40:07.239 --> 00:40:08.340]  This is very disturbing.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.099]  This is with an antigen-based vaccine.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:18.380]  The U.S. has poured a huge amount of money into Moderna to make a messenger RNA bird flu vaccine.
[00:40:18.619 --> 00:40:29.019]  And now we have Dr. Wen coming on all the TV shows pushing the Biden administration to get this bird flu vaccine out.
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.420]  It looks like it would be dangerous.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.400]  It would be poorly effective.
[00:40:33.719 --> 00:40:43.000]  And it's a far wiser strategy to use dilute povidone iodine nasal sprays and throat sprays, gargles, even dilute.
[00:40:43.179 --> 00:40:45.179]  Eye drops are perfectly fine.
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:52.340]  And at the wellness company, we provide those in immune mist and we have a contagion kit that can treat bird flu easily.
[00:40:53.199 --> 00:40:55.639]  We've only had 65 human cases.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:01.900]  They've been mild, save for one man who didn't get early treatment with the wellness company products.
[00:41:02.179 --> 00:41:18.099]  So I would much rather see America outfit our farm workers with practical things to reduce contact with and contracting the virus as opposed to getting sick and waiting for a vaccine.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:30.860]  That's exactly the same thing that happened Absolutely.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:39.639]  I mean, we just saw the disaster that happened over 2020, so I love the therapeutic approach rather than just trusting these experimental medications.
[00:41:39.639 --> 00:41:51.909]  I'm somebody with type A severe hemophilia, and so I have family that actually lived during the 80s when companies like Bayer infected 10,000 hemophiliacs in the United States knowingly with HIV and hepatitis.
[00:41:52.389 --> 00:42:05.190]  So whenever I see these pharmaceutical companies come out and advocate for experimental medications or vaccines, I'm always a little wary because I understand the audacity of large organizations where no individual feels accountable for their crimes.
[00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:09.289]  And I just can't believe that people may fall for this again.
[00:42:09.289 --> 00:42:10.489]  I hope that they don't.
[00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:13.070]  But I'm looking at this data, Dr. McCullough.
[00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:34.110]  From the World Health Organization, this is from October 25th, 2024, and it's got a breakdown that includes Australia, Cambodia, China, Laos, Vietnam, of human infections since 2003 of H5N1. And I'm looking from 2010 to 2014,
[00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:56.510]  there were 71 cases reported by the WHO. And from 2020 to 2024, there have only been a cumulative 23. Now, I'm sure that some went under the radar during COVID because they probably just blamed it on COVID. But if there were three times the number of human cases of this virus from 2010 to 2014,
[00:42:56.929 --> 00:43:02.170]  and there have been in the last four years, why is it that there's all this panic and alarm happening right now?
[00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:09.650]  It's being driven by vaccine promoters and enthusiasts who are set to profit massively.
[00:43:10.239 --> 00:43:26.940]  From vaccination, the Gates Foundation, World Economic Forum, their product, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, CEPI, they've all invested massively, not only in messenger RNA, bird flu vaccines, but self-replicating vaccines.
[00:43:27.119 --> 00:43:31.380]  These are vaccines we can't turn off once they're injected into the human body.
[00:43:31.539 --> 00:43:37.239]  So it's a play for the vaccine industry to reap massive profits.
[00:43:37.239 --> 00:43:39.599]  Remember, their customers are governments.
[00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:47.630]  And we've already seen the government of Finland, as an example, invest and they've started to vaccinate farm workers.
[00:43:47.849 --> 00:43:50.050]  The European Commission has invested.
[00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:52.730]  The U.S. government invested in Moderna.
[00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:58.710]  It's a giant mistake because it will foster resistant strains.
[00:43:58.869 --> 00:44:01.010]  Right now, there is no human-to-human spread.
[00:44:01.409 --> 00:44:05.610]  We've never had a U.S. death due to bird flu ever.
[00:44:05.869 --> 00:44:18.190]  Now, there have been deaths in Southeast Asia with very undernourished, poor families sleeping with chickens, having no access to health care, and those legacy mortality rates that are quoted.
[00:44:18.409 --> 00:44:40.679]  In fact, Leanna Nguyen and Deborah Birx have recently, I think, misled America by quoting these These mortality rates from the legacy data, they don't apply in the U.S. A wellness company kid outfits patients with using ulcetemivir to help reduce viral replication.
[00:44:41.059 --> 00:44:42.539]  Hydroxychloroquine has activity.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:45.719]  We cover secondary pneumonias with azithromycin.
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:49.039]  And, you know, in our hands...
[00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:52.670]  We will not have a serious case of bird flu develop.
[00:44:52.869 --> 00:45:06.090]  It's a much wiser investment to go to onlinehealth.now.com and invest in the immune mist set of products, the nasal spray and gargle, and the black contagion kit from the wellness company.
[00:45:06.329 --> 00:45:11.269]  That's going to cover the problem as farms and workers develop natural immunity.
[00:45:12.199 --> 00:45:15.760]  You know, I'd actually like to show one of the clips of Berks specifically.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.260]  This is clip number 22, just so the audience can see what you're talking about.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:20.400]  And let's unpack it on the other side.
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:21.039]  Go ahead and run it, please.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:30.860]  It could become infectious to humans even if it's not coexisting with the human flu, right?
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:36.360]  Well, if it mutates like it did in this individual or in the case in Canada.
[00:45:36.659 --> 00:45:39.599]  But that sometimes is a random, slower process.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:43.880]  But if you have that co-infection, then you can share genes.
[00:45:44.429 --> 00:45:44.750]  Okay.
[00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:54.469]  And that's a really, to me, the spring and the summer where we had all of the dairy cattle to farm worker exposure, we didn't have human flu circulating.
[00:45:54.710 --> 00:46:08.590]  So now we're entering a much more dangerous period, yet we're still not testing and we should be providing tests free of charge to dairy farm workers so they can test anonymously weekly because they'll want to know.
[00:46:09.219 --> 00:46:15.480]  If they have both cases of potential flu co-circulating in their own body to protect their families.
[00:46:15.639 --> 00:46:16.539]  People are very smart.
[00:46:16.679 --> 00:46:19.179]  I find the American public to be incredibly smart.
[00:46:19.179 --> 00:46:26.119]  If you tell them the risk and you give them the tools, they will utilize them to protect themselves and their family.
[00:46:26.579 --> 00:46:34.179]  So, given this double whammy that you laid out, do you think it's just a matter of time until there's just a full-fledged pandemic here?
[00:46:35.679 --> 00:46:46.539]  Well, certainly we're setting ourselves up for that potential, which, you know, I flash back to January of 2020 and I'm hearing the same words come out of the CDC. Like what?
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.320]  Low risk, low risk human to human transmission.
[00:46:50.619 --> 00:46:59.820]  Didn't we hear that from the WHO and the CDC about COVID? So I think our way through this is to use 21st century technology.
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:04.360]  Remember, it was the private sector that gave us tests within weeks.
[00:47:05.059 --> 00:47:07.739]  We went from 20,000 tests to 2 million tests.
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:23.619]  So if we got the private sector engaged in our response, they would help us get tests out to all of the dairy farms, all the poultry farms, where they could test both the chickens and the people exposed to the chickens, and then we would know how far spread this virus was.
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.119]  Right now we're just looking for symptoms again.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:29.079]  We should never be tracking viruses through symptoms.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.440]  You don't see a virus through a symptom.
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:33.219]  You see the virus through the test.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:36.539]  And we know from COVID, most of the spread was asymptomatic.
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:42.400]  If we had been testing in January, as many other countries were, we wouldn't have had the spread that we had.
[00:47:43.019 --> 00:47:52.300]  So I'm hoping we learn from So, Doctor, we see this motif of advocating for expanded government powers in response to pandemics.
[00:47:52.579 --> 00:47:59.139]  This was obviously in the omnibus bill, the $1.2 trillion bill that you briefly mentioned that Mike Johnson put forward a couple of weeks ago, of course, was voted down.
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:01.960]  There were government expansions on the next pandemic.
[00:48:02.139 --> 00:48:07.360]  We've got Gavin Newsom declaring a state of emergency in California because one person in Louisiana came down with the flu.
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:16.760]  And when I look back on 2020, and please correct me if I'm wrong, it seems to me that the response to that pandemic was far deadlier than the pandemic itself.
[00:48:17.099 --> 00:48:20.199]  The amount of people that were displaced, the amount of jobs that were lost.
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:21.920]  I mean, I know they've done studies.
[00:48:22.039 --> 00:48:27.380]  They did studies back during the Reagan administration that every 1% that unemployment goes up in the United States.
[00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:32.550]  40,000 people die, 30 to 40,000 people die from stress-related deaths, heart attacks, things like that.
[00:48:32.849 --> 00:48:40.329]  And so if you look at all the people that lost their businesses and their jobs, there's thousands of people, thousands upon thousands that died during 2020 because of the response.
[00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:43.690]  We know that people weren't getting screened or tested for cancer.
[00:48:44.099 --> 00:48:49.719]  Because they didn't want to go to the hospital because they thought everybody there was sick with COVID. And so there's cancer rates that are going through the roof.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:53.059]  Obviously, there's myocarditis issues, other issues from the vaccine response.
[00:48:53.059 --> 00:48:58.440]  Seems to me that the response to COVID-19 resulted in more deaths than COVID-19 itself.
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.559]  I could be incorrect there.
[00:48:59.719 --> 00:49:12.119]  And I don't understand how these people have the audacity to advocate for an even more robust response to this seemingly non-issue bird flu when we know what happened after the last time.
[00:49:12.119 --> 00:49:12.920]  What's going on, doctor?
[00:49:14.139 --> 00:49:22.579]  I agree with you, particularly useless asymptomatic PCR testing, which is what Berks is advocating.
[00:49:23.039 --> 00:49:30.820]  Remember, that was done during COVID, during the time where employers did asymptomatic testing.
[00:49:31.099 --> 00:49:32.820]  All of the studies weighed in.
[00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:36.780]  The rate of any positive test was way less than 1%.
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:40.619]  And when it was positive, It was a false positive.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:53.679]  So in 2021, against what Dr. Birx is advocating, in 2021, the WHO said stop asymptomatic testing because COVID-19 is not spread asymptomatically.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:50:04.719]  Now Birx is advocating to test both animals and humans who are asymptomatic with the bird flu PCR test, which will raise false positive results.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:08.280]  Remember, testing is not a preventive therapy.
[00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:28.789]  It's much wiser to use nasal sprays and gargles and throat sprays than actually trying to test for the virus, keep our workforce healthy, let the animals gain natural immunity, and don't start a campaign for quarantining,
[00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:30.929]  which is what Gavin Newsom is doing right now.
[00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:38.670]  They got 47% of the cattle quarantined, and then do PCR testing And not offering any solution.
[00:50:39.889 --> 00:50:43.329]  What's the point of quarantining the cattle if it spreads via mallards?
[00:50:43.889 --> 00:50:48.190]  The whole point of the gain of function research was that you can quarantine cattle and it will still spread, right?
[00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:57.489]  Right, and so the quarantining and the PCR is useless because the mallard ducks will continue to reinfect the farms.
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:09.059]  And one of the things you'll see from the CDC, as well as their surrogates like Dr. Wen and Dr. Burks, is they never mention how it's spreading from farm to farm.
[00:51:09.219 --> 00:51:13.480]  You started out by saying farms are greatly separated.
[00:51:13.639 --> 00:51:16.460]  So the vector of spread is the male or duck.
[00:51:16.639 --> 00:51:18.619]  It's going to continue to be reinfected.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:27.300]  PCR testing that's government controlled, that cannot be validated, and then having a case count that's not adjudicated.
[00:51:27.599 --> 00:51:29.599]  Burke says we can't rely on symptoms.
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:39.460]  You know, what I say is we should have a clinical definition for an animal case of bird flu and a human case of bird flu and then do accurate epidemiology.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.760]  That's not what she's suggesting.
[00:51:42.869 --> 00:51:50.750]  Now you mentioned that this strain of, if I understood correctly, of the bird flu is much less lethal than earlier strains.
[00:51:50.969 --> 00:52:02.889]  And I know that there are reports from other nations that might have iodine deficiencies or other issues that are causing them to be immunocompromised that show that 50 to 60% of people who get infected with the bird flu die.
[00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:04.710]  That's been the historical kind of report.
[00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:07.449]  Is that just not true of this strain, especially in the United States?
[00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:09.730]  Why is it that it's less lethal than it used to be?
[00:52:10.679 --> 00:52:25.739]  That 50% mortality rate comes from data two decades ago in Southeast Asia, undernourished families sleeping with their chickens, no access to healthcare, and they got very sick over many, many weeks.
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:41.489]  There were cases published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2005. I reviewed those cases, and I think every one of them would have been saved in a U.S. healthcare system even back in 2005. Now with the wellness company products, immune mist,
[00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:46.969]  nasal sprays and gargles and contagion kit, I don't think we'll even have a serious case.
[00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:57.179]  Now, the man who was hospitalized in Louisiana He had dead birds in his backyard, had a lot of contact, waited a very long time, got sick.
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:58.639]  He had medical problems.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.400]  He's over age 65. He's hospitalized.
[00:53:00.599 --> 00:53:02.500]  He's going to survive and he's going to be okay.
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:08.280]  And we're going to preserve our track record that we've never had a U.S. death due to bird flu.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.579]  We've never had human-to-human transmission.
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:19.119]  What you're seeing in the media now is a false alarm to create fear and drive people into mass vaccination.
[00:53:20.669 --> 00:53:20.989]  Unbelievable.
[00:53:21.309 --> 00:53:22.789]  I really hope that we don't fall for it again.
[00:53:22.969 --> 00:53:28.090]  It's so soon since 2020. Dr. McCullough, it's been an honor and pleasure to have you on The Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:29.250]  Thank you for joining me.
[00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:30.610]  I learned a lot from this conversation.
[00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:32.150]  I always learn a lot listening to you.
[00:53:32.289 --> 00:53:44.690]  Please follow him on x at p underscore McCullough, MD, and visit onlinehealthnow.com to get all of the healthy preventative measures you need to keep yourself from getting sick at all.
[00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:47.610]  I mean, this isn't going to just help Dr. McCullough with bird flu.
[00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:49.449]  I mean, this is going to help with any virus, right?
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:51.360]  That's right.
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:55.280]  Birx mentioned co-infection with the seasonal influenza and bird flu.
[00:53:55.380 --> 00:54:00.519]  The only way to handle it is with the immune mist, nasal spray and gargle, and the black contagion kit.
[00:54:00.719 --> 00:54:02.139]  Co-infection can happen.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.340]  The chances of that are very, very low.
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:08.960]  But if it does, let's handle it early and not let it get out of control.
[00:54:09.449 --> 00:54:10.230]  Thank you so much.
[00:54:10.349 --> 00:54:10.889]  Honor and pleasure.
[00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:12.230]  Stay with us for more on the other side.
[00:54:29.819 --> 00:54:39.619]  We're good to go.
[00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:46.829]  There are five limited edition fundraiser posters.
[00:54:46.989 --> 00:54:48.769]  And by fundraiser, everything raises funds there.
[00:54:48.849 --> 00:54:52.469]  But the t-shirts cost like 16, 17 bucks a piece before you buy them.
[00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:55.150]  And then the sponsor gets half or we get half.
[00:54:55.269 --> 00:54:59.590]  And to run all this and build a new network as a backup, you know, we're squeaking by.
[00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:06.650]  But when something says fundraiser on it, like a t-shirt that's cost double or a poster, yeah, the poster costs five, six bucks.
[00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:10.409]  I mean, the shipping, we ship it in the special packaging costs as much as the poster itself.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:14.679]  So six, seven, eight, nine bucks for the poster cost with the packaging.
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.840]  And then we're selling it for 25, 30 bucks.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.800]  That's because there's some real markup in there to fund it.
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:20.199]  So you know you're buying something.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.539]  There's a memento that you really back what we're doing.
[00:55:23.079 --> 00:55:26.360]  The campaign coins, challenge coins, they're all there.
[00:55:27.579 --> 00:55:30.820]  So the posters run from $19.95 to $29.95.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.880]  And we'll have new limited edition posters after that.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:39.719]  But the posters on January 6th will be no more.
[00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:45.329]  They're limited edition, so if you get your order in by then, you will get the poster because they're print on demand.
[00:55:45.329 --> 00:55:45.989]  They're in Arkansas.
[00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:48.750]  If you want one of these posters, there they are.
[00:55:49.289 --> 00:55:53.170]  And again, you've got until January 6th to get your order in.
[00:55:53.309 --> 00:55:54.510]  They look great hanging on the wall.
[00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:55.329]  We got them hanging here.
[00:55:57.110 --> 00:55:59.210]  And I designed all of these.
[00:55:59.369 --> 00:56:04.670]  My favorite is the Trump graph that I showed the day before the election that predicted the election.
[00:56:04.809 --> 00:56:06.829]  I said, she's going to try to steal it, but it's going to fail.
[00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:12.090]  So the blue line goes up and goes straight up, but it's not enough fraud to overpower the landslide.
[00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:14.269]  And that's actually the graph that actually happened.
[00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:15.710]  The key battlegrounds.
[00:56:15.869 --> 00:56:17.650]  So you talk about nailing it, baby.
[00:56:17.969 --> 00:56:18.849]  That's my favorite.
[00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:19.789]  I designed that one.
[00:56:19.929 --> 00:56:22.090]  And then the 47 one I designed as well.
[00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:23.329]  So I designed those.
[00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.289]  I did not design the Darkest Hour one, but there it is.
[00:56:26.389 --> 00:56:27.070]  Thank you for the support.
[00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.769]  I'm done plugging.
[00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:38.530]  I've just been looking at all the attacks and our victories in court, and I realized how much money it takes to take these people on, and they are so pissed we're still on air, and I have hired high-powered lawyers.
[00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:49.769]  That's why we're winning, and they tell My lawyers are working seven days a week.
[00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:51.949]  Because I go and meet with them almost every day.
[00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:53.989]  And they call me at midnight and say, come to the office.
[00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:55.730]  I want you to read this and sign it, make sure it's accurate.
[00:56:55.889 --> 00:56:56.289]  I mean, we are.
[00:56:57.210 --> 00:57:04.530]  If I told you all the suits we filed on and all the crap we're doing to the whole deep state, because I can't be on defense anymore.
[00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:05.269]  I've got to go on offense.
[00:57:05.929 --> 00:57:07.389]  It would take an hour to go over it all.
[00:57:08.409 --> 00:57:10.329]  But you want me to fight, I'm fighting.
[00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:11.449]  So...
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.400]  You're financing the current operation.
[00:57:14.559 --> 00:57:16.840]  You're financing the back of Alex Jones Network if we get shut down.
[00:57:17.059 --> 00:57:19.119]  And that's still getting built and expanded.
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:20.380]  Not, you know, a larger studio.
[00:57:20.719 --> 00:57:21.380]  Almost done.
[00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:24.500]  And you're financing the legal defense and offense.
[00:57:24.739 --> 00:57:25.679]  I mean, this is a war.
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:26.840]  You want somebody to fight for you?
[00:57:27.019 --> 00:57:28.239]  I love it.
[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:31.619]  I mean, I'm begging for you to keep me in the game, keep me in the fight, Coach.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:33.219]  But I'm here, you're serving.
[00:57:33.559 --> 00:57:34.559]  You commissioned me.
[00:57:35.619 --> 00:57:41.539]  Look, I won't stop regardless of what happens, but I'm asking you to empower me and I will give you everything I got.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:48.239]  I'm so focused right now and so sick of this crap and the stuff that I've been doing to my family behind the scenes, just absolutely criminal.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:51.559]  And so all I'm asking for is the support to keep fighting.
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:53.500]  And we make it easy with incredible products.
[00:57:53.599 --> 00:57:54.260]  Okay, I'm done.
[00:58:19.639 --> 00:58:24.840]  I think an epidemic either naturally caused or intentionally caused.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.420]  Either naturally caused or intentionally caused.
[00:58:28.539 --> 00:58:33.239]  It's the most likely thing to cause, say, 10 million excess deaths.
[00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:55.289]  In what could only be described as a fever dream cooked up by mad scientists with too much Gates money burning holes in their lab coats, the New England Journal of Medicine, Actually published this twisted madness, describing how researchers in the Netherlands were unleashing armies of genetically mutated mosquitoes on human guinea pigs,
[00:58:55.449 --> 00:58:57.610]  all in the name of fighting malaria.
[00:58:57.929 --> 00:59:05.230]  The malaria vaccines currently approved by the World Health Organization are subunit vaccines that result in modest and short-lived protection.
[00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:13.170]  Alternative vaccination strategies based on whole genetically attenuated plasmodium parasites have the potential to improve protection.
[00:59:13.909 --> 00:59:23.570]  They dubbed it GA2, a Frankenstein's monster of a parasite engineered to lurk in human liver cells for six days before shutting down.
[00:59:23.769 --> 00:59:28.889]  Its predecessor, GA1, had been a 24-hour flash in the pan.
[00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:33.510]  The methodology read like a script rejected from a B-grade horror film.
[00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:39.570]  Stage A, subject volunteers to be swarmed by 15 to 50 infected mosquitoes.
[00:59:39.869 --> 00:59:42.510]  Stage B was even more deranged.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:51.880]  Random selection for either 50 mutant-carrying mosquitoes, or if you were the lucky one, just regular old blood-sucking insects.
[00:59:52.079 --> 00:59:54.360]  A placebo by way of proboscis.
[00:59:54.599 --> 00:59:56.960]  And here's where it gets completely twisted.
[00:59:57.219 --> 01:00:09.639]  20% of the poor human subjects showed signs of heart damage, which the researchers dismissed with a kind of casual wave, unrelated to the trial intervention, they claimed.
[01:00:09.849 --> 01:00:15.329]  Offering no explanation beyond a cryptic smile and a stack of Gates Foundation receipts.
[01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:20.949]  $2,287,871 worth of them, to be exact.
[01:00:21.269 --> 01:00:26.829]  Dr. Richard Bartlett, one of the few voices of sanity in this pharmaceutical nightmare.
[01:00:27.179 --> 01:00:32.199]  Called it what it was, a serious safety signal that cannot be ignored.
[01:00:32.199 --> 01:00:41.880]  But in the current climate of medical McCarthyism, where dissent equals deletion, his warnings might as well have been whispered into a hurricane.
[01:00:42.119 --> 01:00:47.820]  There's no guarantee to free speech on misinformation or hate speech, and especially around our democracy.
[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:50.460]  Misinformation, disinformation is indeed dangerous.
[01:00:50.699 --> 01:00:52.900]  It gets in the way in what we're trying to do here.
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:01:00.440]  But haven't we seen many Democrats in the last six years pressuring Facebook and Twitter and now TikTok to be stronger in content moderation?
[01:01:01.099 --> 01:01:03.880]  Hasn't that been a wave that we've seen crash over for years now?
[01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:12.389]  Well, I think this is the question of, you know, I mean, ultimately what we're trying to achieve there is some measure of public safety, right?
[01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:22.230]  Further out in the future, we'll actually have gene drive which changes the genetics of the mosquitoes and either reduces their population or reduces how long they live.
[01:01:22.409 --> 01:01:24.489]  That could have dramatic benefits.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:35.559]  We have great tools today that we need to keep evolving and some very exciting ones in the pipeline because those will be key to achieve our ultimate goal of eradication.
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:48.960]  The UN's World Mosquito Program announced in 2023 a plan to release billions of gene-edited mosquitoes in Brazil over a 10-year period in a bid to eradicate dengue fever in the country.
[01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:54.820]  Rio has registered over 10,000 cases of dengue fever in just over a month.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.539]  Already, three Brazilian states have declared emergencies.
[01:01:58.719 --> 01:02:09.619]  Cases of dengue in Brazil since the start of the year have exceeded the total for the whole of 2023. If you had a guy like Bill Gates leading the World Health Organization, I would increase funding.
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:15.760]  The deadly mosquito-borne virus encephalitis has been detected in regional South Australia for the first time.
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:21.219]  The virus has been found in Clare, two hours north of Adelaide on a sentinel chicken farm.
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:35.139]  Oxford, Massachusetts and three neighboring towns have a reason for concern as mosquitoes carrying a potentially deadly virus called Eastern Equine Encephalitis or Triple E infected a resident who is now fighting for his life.
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.139]  Now malaria is, of course, transmitted by mosquitoes.
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:42.719]  I brought some here so you could experience this.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:47.920]  We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.
[01:02:49.159 --> 01:02:49.619]  There.
[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:53.420]  There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:03:05.780]  A brave new world where vaccines come not in syringes, but on the wings of millions of engineered insects, turning the entire planet into an involuntary clinical trial.
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:13.179]  Welcome to the future, where consent is as obsolete as last year's pandemic response playbook.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.900]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.
[01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:19.250]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host of The Alex Jones Show.
[01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:22.210]  Today, we've got so much news to cover over the next three hours.
[01:03:22.369 --> 01:03:28.230]  We've got Thomas Renz joining us in one hour, and we're going to unpack all of the details and clips surrounding this pandemic.
[01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:32.869]  I told you before, and I will tell you again, on November 5th, we did not win a war.
[01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:37.570]  We started one, just like on July 4th, 1776, when we declared independence.
[01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:42.789]  We started a war, and now we are seeing the new world order strike back.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:48.840]  I have stack after stack, article after article on the desk covering this bird flu.
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:53.559]  We just spoke with Dr. Peter McCullough, obviously a very brilliant, honest, informed man.
[01:03:54.159 --> 01:03:56.360]  And looking at all the details, I mean, it's a nothing burger.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.239]  It's obvious that this bird flu is not a threat.
[01:03:58.380 --> 01:03:59.840]  There's no human to human transmission.
[01:04:00.119 --> 01:04:01.639]  It's coming from poultry to humans.
[01:04:01.739 --> 01:04:03.480]  It's less lethal than it used to be.
[01:04:03.559 --> 01:04:08.679]  If you have a good immune system or good health care or access to good health care, then it's not even going to be a problem for you if you get it.
[01:04:09.219 --> 01:04:29.329]  It's been around since at least 1961. The first human case was in 1997, and there were three times the number of human beings infected with H1, H5N1, excuse me, between 2010 and 2014 than there have been since 2020. So we've already gone through a period where more people have had it.
[01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:34.969]  And yes, it used to be very deadly, reporting 50-60% mortality rates of those infected.
[01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:36.710]  But these are people that were sleeping with their chickens.
[01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:40.369]  They suffered from iodine deficiency because they didn't get Ultimate CMOS from the Alex Jones store.
[01:04:40.889 --> 01:04:43.590]  Because they didn't have the right nutrition or the right access to healthcare.
[01:04:44.289 --> 01:04:51.210]  One person gets the bird flu in Louisiana and California declares a state of emergency that allows the culling of herds.
[01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:55.929]  State operatives to go onto farmers' property in hazmat suits.
[01:04:57.210 --> 01:05:13.269]  The quarantining of these herds, despite the fact that what Peter McCullough just revealed in a peer-reviewed paper is that gain-of-function research was conducted on this flu so that it would transmit from chickens,
[01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:21.909]  poultry, to mallard ducks, allowing the ducks to deliver it to different herds, different flocks, different groups of cattle, animals all over the country.
[01:05:22.409 --> 01:05:24.349]  So you can quarantine all you want.
[01:05:24.469 --> 01:05:26.090]  You can isolate everything.
[01:05:26.949 --> 01:05:31.210]  One group of chickens from another group of chickens, but if it's going into the Mallard Ducks, then it's all moot, right?
[01:05:31.949 --> 01:05:38.429]  Just like the mask mandates were moot, just like the social distancing was moot, just like the lockdowns were moot.
[01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:54.349]  It's all totally unnecessary, and it's because we have a major lobby, a major push for vaccines, and a major political agenda to create as many obstacles for the Trump administration as possible.
[01:05:54.429 --> 01:05:54.989]  I mean, look at this.
[01:05:55.809 --> 01:05:56.409]  Overhead can.
[01:05:56.610 --> 01:05:57.769]  We have our head in the sand.
[01:05:57.929 --> 01:06:01.449]  Health experts warn U.S. isn't reacting fast enough to threat of bird flu.
[01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:06.590]  Experts worried bird flu spread is reaching boiling point.
[01:06:07.989 --> 01:06:09.389]  Cats can get sick with bird flu.
[01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:10.329]  Here's how to protect them.
[01:06:10.409 --> 01:06:11.250]  So now your pets are going to die.
[01:06:11.389 --> 01:06:12.710]  They said the same thing about COVID-19.
[01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:17.090]  Bird flu detected in small backyard flock in Vermont.
[01:06:17.809 --> 01:06:19.150]  Dr. Lino N says bird flu.
[01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:21.289]  We should have learned our lesson from COVID and testing.
[01:06:22.059 --> 01:06:36.039]  Outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, H5N1 viruses in U.S. dairy cattle and detection of two human cases in the United States in 2024. Bird flu samples show mutations that may make it easier to spread to people, CDC reports.
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:40.940]  What to know as CDC finds concerning mutation, NBC Chicago.
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.059]  Bird flu impacting California's egg supply.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.960]  Bird flu outbreak hits Sweet Marsh public wetland.
[01:06:47.519 --> 01:06:51.039]  Oregon avian flu cat death prompts nationwide raw pet food recall.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:55.639]  And the bird flu circulating is affecting birds and cattle and even cats and dogs.
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:57.260]  So your pets are going to die.
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:58.519]  It's all over the country.
[01:06:58.619 --> 01:06:59.739]  You're going to get it.
[01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:00.579]  It's mutating.
[01:07:00.579 --> 01:07:01.360]  It's lethal.
[01:07:01.579 --> 01:07:02.139]  It's going to kill.
[01:07:02.659 --> 01:07:08.300]  50-60% of all people who get it according to the government and the pundits, and it's all just a bunch of baloney.
[01:07:10.119 --> 01:07:14.380]  And, you know, I can't believe that I didn't realize this, that I didn't know this, and I'm so glad that Dr. McCullough came on.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:21.420]  I thought that the difference between this bird flu and the COVID-19 pandemic was that the COVID-19 pandemic was manufactured.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:40.980]  Actually created using gain-of-function research in the Wuhan lab and then intentionally spread all over the world after China shut down domestic travel in and out of Wuhan but allowed international travel in and out of Wuhan for months and months before admitting to the world that there was a leak and this virus was spreading.
[01:07:41.639 --> 01:07:44.619]  Obviously manufactured, obviously spread intentionally.
[01:07:45.019 --> 01:08:07.570]  But I thought with this bird flu, since it had been around since 1961, I thought that this was just the deep state trying to take advantage of an opportunity, trying to identify a real virus that naturally existed and then hype up the risk or the threats associated with it in order to create this fear they need to mass inoculate everyone,
[01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:12.590]  make millions upon millions, billions upon billions of dollars with these vaccines, fund Bill Gates and others.
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:18.800]  Increased government powers and control over agriculture and all of our lives again.
[01:08:19.079 --> 01:08:24.760]  I thought they were just using it as an opportunity, but it turns out they actually created this version of the bird flu with gain-of-function research.
[01:08:25.619 --> 01:08:32.500]  They made this version of bird flu more capable of spreading from flock to flock to flock.
[01:08:34.119 --> 01:08:41.739]  So again, we are supposedly now victims of a biological weapon.
[01:08:43.689 --> 01:08:44.289]  Biological warfare.
[01:08:46.949 --> 01:08:50.130]  And what they don't say in any of the headlines is that you don't get it from other humans.
[01:08:51.079 --> 01:08:56.760]  We think of the flu just colloquially, naturally, as something that you get if someone sneezes on you or coughs on you.
[01:08:56.859 --> 01:09:05.159]  So they use bird flu, bird flu, bird flu, implying just subtly that it's incredibly infectious when the fact of the matter is it isn't.
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:07.739]  And it's not even as deadly as it was before.
[01:09:07.859 --> 01:09:09.180]  It's totally ridiculous.
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:12.060]  And they're doing this for so many reasons simultaneously.
[01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:16.939]  There are so many compiling reasons that they want to do this.
[01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:22.569]  We know that Gates and the CCP want more control over agriculture.
[01:09:22.569 --> 01:09:24.270]  After all, they are buying all of the land.
[01:09:24.930 --> 01:09:28.430]  A hundred years ago in this country, most farmers actually owned the land that they farm.
[01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:32.850]  Now they pay to farm the land owned by Black Rocks or Bill Gates or the CCP or others.
[01:09:34.090 --> 01:09:41.689]  We've seen this farmland bought up to the tune of thousands upon thousands of acres all across the country.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:53.640]  And we've seen reports from Bill Gates and other globalists that we want to eliminate cattle, namely cows, because they're responsible for 6% of the methane going into the environment.
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:10:02.359]  So because of climate change, we have to eat artificial meat which is unhealthy for us and we have to eliminate all of our livestock.
[01:10:05.739 --> 01:10:14.180]  What's more, we've seen that over the course of the last four years, we've had a 200% increase in spontaneous poultry farm fires compared to the four years before.
[01:10:15.149 --> 01:10:20.949]  From 2016 to 2020, 500,000 chickens died in spontaneous poultry farm fires.
[01:10:21.409 --> 01:10:25.109]  From 2020 to 2024, it's 1.5 million.
[01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:26.710]  An increase of 200%.
[01:10:26.710 --> 01:10:27.609]  It's not a coincidence.
[01:10:27.869 --> 01:10:28.810]  There's not a drought.
[01:10:29.069 --> 01:10:33.689]  There's not an increased risk of fire this last four years compared to the four years before that.
[01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:34.310]  It's ridiculous.
[01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:36.590]  Something is really going on.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:54.500]  And with these states of emergency being declared in California and this globalist push for us not to have any livestock, it seems to me that this is a manufactured instance of food shortages.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.899]  They're trying to eliminate the supply of food.
[01:11:01.289 --> 01:11:06.729]  And what happens if we suddenly have no chicken or it's too expensive to purchase?
[01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:13.350]  What happens if we suddenly have no beef because of regulations or some flu that is infecting all of the cattle?
[01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:15.369]  What happens if we have no more milk?
[01:11:18.010 --> 01:11:22.069]  Well, then there's an opportunity for the government to come in and give you the relief.
[01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:25.529]  They're just so itching to give you at the expense of your liberties.
[01:11:25.789 --> 01:11:33.659]  Well, if the private sector can't handle Supplying the people of the United States of America with food, then I guess the government ought to get involved.
[01:11:34.039 --> 01:11:41.699]  And they come in and they buy up all the farmland and they control everything and they fund, with your tax dollars, all the research and development of this artificial meat.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:46.260]  And you know that the globalists are investing in these artificial meat companies on a massive scale.
[01:11:47.239 --> 01:11:59.170]  It's been a while since I've seen the reports, but names that you would know, household names, from the globalist philosophy of I've been investing in this artificial impossible burger stuff for years.
[01:12:01.210 --> 01:12:04.689]  So they control the food supply then if there's a shortage, a manufactured shortage.
[01:12:05.529 --> 01:12:08.489]  They also control the new supply of the artificial meat.
[01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:16.609]  They get people to give up their liberties and their private property rights to the government because this bird flu is just so dangerous.
[01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:17.789]  This pandemic is just so dangerous.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:33.779]  And they're able to do all the things that they were able to do in 2020 in response to that pandemic with this one where they force you to get vaccinated, where they force you to stay home, where they shut down your businesses so the major companies can come buy up all the small businesses and monopolize the market.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:39.659]  I mean, we know that mom-and-pop restaurants and grocery stores went out of business in droves during the 2020 pandemic.
[01:12:40.039 --> 01:12:46.819]  And the Amazons of the world and the fast food chains were able to buy up all of the real estate, were able to monopolize the market and take over.
[01:12:48.829 --> 01:12:51.449]  This is a mass transfer of wealth.
[01:12:51.670 --> 01:12:56.270]  It's the redistribution of wealth, but not taking from the rich and giving to the poor like they would have you believe.
[01:12:56.710 --> 01:12:59.710]  It's taking from the middle class and giving even more to the rich.
[01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:07.189]  The worse inflation gets, the more the government spends, the better the rich seem to do because they're the only ones with enough money to invest in the market.
[01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:11.329]  Stock market goes up when there's tons of liquid cash suddenly.
[01:13:11.329 --> 01:13:15.329]  In the last four years, I believe 40% of all dollars ever printed were printed.
[01:13:15.689 --> 01:13:20.710]  And the banks didn't even know what to do with those dollars, so they put them all in the stock market and everybody who was invested really well.
[01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:23.390]  You got Joe Biden bragging about how great the stock market's doing.
[01:13:23.409 --> 01:13:25.109]  It's because of massive hyperinflation.
[01:13:28.899 --> 01:13:45.060]  So they're manufacturing this food shortage so they can control every aspect of your life, fund these vaccines and climate change initiatives, and totally change the face of the world.
[01:13:46.539 --> 01:13:50.640]  All because some guy in Louisiana got the flu.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.500]  I mean, you'd think that they would be more concerned about the things that are actually threats.
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:08.520]  You'd think they'd be more concerned about World War III and thermonuclear war and not Joe Biden giving another $2.5 billion, as he announced today, to Ukraine right before his administration is over.
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:12.760]  Further escalating a conflict with Russia, a major nuclear power.
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:15.460]  An unnecessary escalation.
[01:14:16.569 --> 01:14:17.590]  You think they care about that?
[01:14:17.789 --> 01:14:37.529]  You think that they would care about the fact that our dollar isn't backed by anything meaningful and is dependent on the petrodollar system, which is the reason we're constantly in war in the Middle East, which is the reason nations like Israel have so much leverage over us because we have to have an ally in the region so we can force other Middle Eastern countries to trade oil and dollars,
[01:14:37.729 --> 01:14:44.970]  which creates an artificial demand for the dollar, which allows us to sanction our allies and enemies alike by withholding the money that they make.
[01:14:46.439 --> 01:14:47.600]  And we wonder why the world hates us.
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:15:01.560]  You would think that our government, our leaders, would be more concerned with the fact that hyperinflation is a major problem, that we have an unsustainable monetary system when we're on the cusp of thermonuclear war, than a bird flu that has infected a single man in Louisiana and maybe killed a cat in Vermont.
[01:15:03.819 --> 01:15:07.420]  But you see, it's not about actually dealing with real issues for them.
[01:15:08.119 --> 01:15:11.340]  It's not about the public safety as they would have you think.
[01:15:13.199 --> 01:15:16.199]  We know that the WHO doesn't care about public safety or public health.
[01:15:16.899 --> 01:15:21.239]  Leaders from the WHO refused to refer to Taiwan as Taiwan.
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:30.819]  They call it Chinese Taipei because they're owned by the CCP. And if they're owned by the CCP, then why didn't they report in September of 2019 that this COVID-19 virus was spreading?
[01:15:32.199 --> 01:15:36.819]  Why did China keep it a secret for months and no one held them accountable for it?
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.220]  Well, we're owned by the CCP and they manufacture our drugs.
[01:15:41.399 --> 01:15:43.079]  They manufacture all of our products.
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.859]  And they manufacture all of our crises, too.
[01:15:49.739 --> 01:15:54.279]  And when any of our politicians stand up to them or have any leverage to stand up to them, they simply pay them off.
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:56.300]  I mean, didn't you see the pictures this week coming out?
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.260]  Joe Biden and Hunter Biden with Chinese officials at the end of his vice presidency.
[01:16:02.159 --> 01:16:05.720]  We've seen report after report after report of the corruption.
[01:16:05.899 --> 01:16:07.399]  There's evidence after evidence after evidence.
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:15.819]  And they came out and they said, they had the audacity to say to you that the reason Joe Biden pardoned Hunter Biden is because Hunter Biden is about ready to publish a tell-all book.
[01:16:16.619 --> 01:16:23.239]  What could he possibly publish in any book that we don't already know from all of the emails in the laptop?
[01:16:26.569 --> 01:16:33.310]  This military industrial complex is just expanding indefinitely while they think you are dumb enough to fall for this next pandemic.
[01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:43.050]  Frankly, I would rather suffer the inconveniences of a real pandemic than the inconveniences of a real police state.
[01:16:46.529 --> 01:16:54.869]  But I'm not going to suffer the inconveniences of a fake pandemic used to usher in a real police state.
[01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:59.909]  I mean, at this point, wouldn't you rather get the bubonic plague than deal with tyranny?
[01:17:02.289 --> 01:17:03.630]  Live free or die, right?
[01:17:06.850 --> 01:17:09.130]  But they're just doing this because they want to undermine Trump.
[01:17:09.649 --> 01:17:11.250]  And it's deeper than that.
[01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:14.689]  They need to undermine populism as a philosophy.
[01:17:14.949 --> 01:17:22.350]  They need to undermine national sovereignty as a philosophy because national sovereignty is the antithesis to globalism.
[01:17:22.729 --> 01:17:24.689]  Individualism is the antithesis to globalism.
[01:17:24.789 --> 01:17:39.970]  And if you pay attention and look back at what happened between 2016 and 2019, the better Trump did as President of the United States, the better the effects and outcomes of his policies were, the more the left hated him.
[01:17:41.279 --> 01:17:42.079]  Isn't that bizarre?
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:54.479]  I mean, don't you think if we're all patriots, if we're all Americans, we love this country, we want the best for this country, then we will be happy no matter who our leaders were, no matter who the president was, if the president was doing a good job.
[01:17:55.689 --> 01:17:59.210]  I mean, for God's sake, if Joe Biden had done an outstanding job, I would have been delighted.
[01:17:59.590 --> 01:18:06.010]  I would have been a little bit embarrassed at how wrong I was before he was elected in 2020 about him.
[01:18:06.569 --> 01:18:12.130]  But I'd be very pleased to see this country doing very well, to see the world as peaceful as it had ever been.
[01:18:12.789 --> 01:18:14.970]  Our dollar is as strong as it had ever been.
[01:18:15.409 --> 01:18:17.949]  Our healthcare is as good and affordable as it had ever been.
[01:18:18.029 --> 01:18:19.409]  Our education is as good as it had ever been.
[01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:20.949]  I'd be happy to see that.
[01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:35.600]  But the thing with Trump that you'll notice is between 2016 and 2019, The better his administration did, the more successful his administration was, the more they hated him because it proved that his policies were actually healthier and better.
[01:18:35.739 --> 01:18:40.199]  And they were concerned that they were losing their grip on the psyche of the American people.
[01:18:42.479 --> 01:18:48.239]  Yes, right when he got elected, they blamed Cambridge Analytica, and they tried to hype up the Russian collusion hoax.
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:54.439]  But the impeachments came later, and they were more intense, and the accusations of insurrection came later.
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:19:00.800]  And they hated him, and they hated him, and the economy was booming, and the stock market was record high.
[01:19:02.619 --> 01:19:03.640]  Revenues were high.
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:09.399]  Tax revenues, despite the fact that taxes have been lowered, that really pissed them off, because they're always advocating for tax increases.
[01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:11.670]  And so what did they do?
[01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:16.470]  They conspired with the CCP to release a virus that they had manufactured.
[01:19:17.890 --> 01:19:27.890]  They used their controlled media and censorship to hype up the fear and the perceived threat of the virus.
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:41.800]  And then they use the same mechanisms to justify the response and make billions upon billions of dollars while hundreds of thousands of Americans unnecessarily died and are still dying as a ripple effect of their policies.
[01:19:43.159 --> 01:19:59.199]  And somehow, four years later, there's still a large swath of our population that doesn't understand what happened in 2020. Somehow, four years later, after all the lies, all the studies, all of the whistleblowers, there are still people at the subway, at the airport,
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:03.819]  and restaurants wearing masks when the EPA itself said that masks don't work.
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:23.800]  Somehow, four years later, after all of the evidence, all of the vaccine injuries, all of the myocarditis, There are still people right now on their way to CVS or Walgreens to get the latest COVID-19 booster.
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.060]  Isn't that unbelievable?
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:42.890]  And the only way to overcome this level of brainwashing, to wake these non-player characters up, these NPCs up, Is to ensure that we always have free speech and that we're broadcasting the truth far and wide constantly.
[01:20:43.529 --> 01:20:46.590]  Because a lie can only stand for so long in the context of the truth.
[01:20:47.609 --> 01:20:50.470]  It withers like a weed in the blazing sun.
[01:20:53.170 --> 01:20:58.710]  And that's why the left wants only darkness and fear and terror and isolation.
[01:20:59.409 --> 01:21:03.430]  They want you in a corner thinking you're the only one with your thoughts, with your sentiments.
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:08.979]  Because they know if you're isolated and terrified, then you can be totally controlled.
[01:21:09.479 --> 01:21:17.699]  Once they isolate you and terrify you, and then control all the information that you consume, then they control what you think.
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.159]  If they control what you think, they control what you do.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.619]  And if they control what you do, then you are subjugated.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:31.840]  So this bird flu hype is a lie that will not live in the context of the truth.
[01:21:32.039 --> 01:21:40.680]  It will not stand against all of the data and experts and truth sayers, the audacity to broadcast the truth and expose these lies.
[01:21:42.359 --> 01:21:53.199]  But it's just another example of the New World Order and the globalists manufacturing a crisis so they can exploit it in order to subjugate humanity.
[01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:58.909]  Let's go to clip number 55 here, RFK exposing Bill Gates.
[01:22:04.729 --> 01:22:05.949]  Clip number 55, please.
[01:22:07.770 --> 01:22:19.970]  Know most about Gates, because I've written a book about him and that what he calls philanthropy capitalism, which is you use philanthropy to make yourself rich and you use it strategically.
[01:22:20.409 --> 01:22:21.949]  And that's what he's done again and again.
[01:22:23.489 --> 01:22:30.789]  He's gotten control of the World Health Organization so that they mandate vaccines all over the world.
[01:22:30.789 --> 01:22:41.840]  And the companies that make those vaccines are Gates He did the same thing with the Green Revolution.
[01:22:42.619 --> 01:22:53.020]  He got a hold of the regulatory agencies in African countries and forced them to change the nature of agriculture.
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:23:04.100]  There's 20,000 generations of agriculture of people growing crops like sorghum and plantains.
[01:23:05.969 --> 01:23:09.069]  Yucca and all these plans for subsistence.
[01:23:10.109 --> 01:23:19.630]  And he said, no, we're gonna transfer them all to these GMO monocultures of corn, and then we're gonna bring in the companies that he owns, Kraft.
[01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:27.449]  Coca-Cola, McDonald's, these big food companies, processing companies to buy that and that's gonna be the deal.
[01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:40.250]  And then, of course, during COVID, all of that shut down and you had, there's 30 billion Africans now as a direct result of Gates' policy who are now on the edge of starvation.
[01:23:40.710 --> 01:23:45.170]  Tell that story that you shared with me a couple years ago about- There you have it, folks.
[01:23:45.369 --> 01:23:48.609]  These are the unintended or intended consequences of this globalism.
[01:23:50.399 --> 01:24:01.239]  Where a certain class of people within our political class are so self-righteous and arrogant that they have come to the conclusion that everything that they decide for you is better for you than what you would decide for yourself.
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:02.720]  This is the whole reason that we have freedom.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:07.340]  No one has the right to make decisions for you or to enact policy that is in your best interest.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.260]  We are the masters of our own fates.
[01:24:09.399 --> 01:24:11.340]  We are the captains of our own souls.
[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:30.289]  And whether this bird flu pandemic works or not, whether they succeed in hyping it up and stoking the fear and exploiting it and exaggerating it, To create an obstacle for Donald Trump and shut down the economy and increase regulation of agriculture and livestock and push vaccines on our populace.
[01:24:31.489 --> 01:24:34.670]  There will be another one and another one and another one.
[01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:51.569]  There will be more bioweapons Time and time again, I mean, we saw with the omnibus bill, $1.2 trillion that was suggested just a couple of weeks ago, with bipartisan support before it was revealed what was in it, that they tried to fund no less than 12 more bio labs.
[01:24:53.310 --> 01:25:05.909]  Doing the same kind of research that was being done at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which resulted in this pandemic, which justified their inoculation of the world just to make a buck.
[01:25:07.319 --> 01:25:15.380]  So it's more important now than ever, not only that you support free speech and the truth so we can combat these lies and stop this from happening, that you fight for your health.
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:38.319]  We're good to go.
[01:25:41.079 --> 01:25:46.119]  And with the bladderwrack root and burdock root, they're more bioavailable than ever.

[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.100]  Let go of his bed.
[01:27:00.659 --> 01:27:01.920]  Let go of his bed.
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:02.899]  He's fucking choking me!
[01:27:03.079 --> 01:27:03.979]  He's choking me!
[01:27:04.079 --> 01:27:04.880]  What the fuck?
[01:27:05.039 --> 01:27:06.579]  Let the fuck off me!
[01:27:06.979 --> 01:27:08.119]  Don't fuck him!
[01:27:08.579 --> 01:27:08.800]  Stop!
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:10.119]  Fuck you, bitch!
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:11.960]  Get the fuck off me!
[01:27:12.199 --> 01:27:13.260]  What are you doing?
[01:27:14.119 --> 01:27:16.100]  You're fucking choking me, dude!
[01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:17.119]  What the fuck?
[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:20.680]  You're fucked in the head!
[01:27:20.899 --> 01:27:21.760]  You're fucked!
[01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:27.449]  Oh, come on through.
[01:27:27.630 --> 01:27:28.649]  Come on through.
[01:27:28.989 --> 01:27:30.510]  What is happening here?
[01:27:30.989 --> 01:27:31.489]  Wow.
[01:27:31.909 --> 01:27:32.989]  What is this lady doing?
[01:27:33.369 --> 01:27:33.770]  Trampling.
[01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:35.189]  Trampling horses.
[01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:45.170]  They just trampled this lady.
[01:27:45.930 --> 01:27:48.010]  They just trampled that lady.
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.739]  They just fully trampled that lady.
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:53.859]  They just fully trampled that lady.
[01:27:57.159 --> 01:27:58.000]  Here's the lady.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:00.279]  Here's the lady that was trampled.
[01:28:19.390 --> 01:28:28.869]  The COVID tyranny and oppression of the last five years was publicly prepared by the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, the WEF for decades before.
[01:28:29.050 --> 01:28:39.989]  They said Disease X will bring in our rural government and our cashless society to control everywhere you go and what you do and train you to stay locked in your house for future carbon lockdowns.
[01:28:40.069 --> 01:28:41.010]  This is all official.
[01:28:42.189 --> 01:28:52.670]  And remember all the criminals, all the big pharma spokespersons being proven wrong and lying and pushing their poison shots and saying they protect you and saying that you can't get the virus or spread it.
[01:28:53.529 --> 01:28:55.810]  It was all a giant criminal psyop.
[01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:57.170]  It's all been declassified.
[01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.829]  It's all been leaked.
[01:28:57.949 --> 01:28:58.529]  It's all come out.
[01:28:58.770 --> 01:29:00.189]  Well, now they're trying it again.
[01:29:00.289 --> 01:29:04.449]  Remember the police horses running over people from Canada to Germany, to Australia.
[01:29:04.729 --> 01:29:07.609]  Remember people getting beat up on the New York subway for not wearing masks.
[01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:09.329]  Remember the children for years wearing masks.
[01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:12.630]  Remember the lockdowns around the world, quote, to counter the virus.
[01:29:13.079 --> 01:29:31.739]  That actually killed tens of millions of people from starvation and then flooded the first world with refugees from the COVID tyranny where the IMF and World Bank went to those third world countries and said, you can't run your farms or your businesses or any of this and collapse their economy so those countries could never pay back the IMF and World Bank loans.
[01:29:32.119 --> 01:29:33.260]  It's about vertical integration.
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:34.800]  It's about waging war on the economy.
[01:29:34.859 --> 01:29:37.560]  It's about eating the bugs, owning nothing and being happy.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:52.680]  And now they're trying to bring it all back again based on PCR tests, based on lies with their new bird flu virus and saying they've got dozens and dozens of new mRNA and other shots for the bird flu, but they don't know what the mutation is going to be, so it really won't work.
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:57.359]  And if you take it, well, it will then mutate other viruses in your body and actually could create something deadly.
[01:29:57.579 --> 01:29:59.439]  I mean, just the basic science.
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:10.819]  We're good to go.
[01:30:17.819 --> 01:30:19.680]  We're not going to buy it as a human population.
[01:30:19.859 --> 01:30:23.479]  This time it's going to blow up in their face, but we've got to get this information out.
[01:30:23.699 --> 01:30:25.460]  Do you want a new national emergency?
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.659]  That's what the Democrats are preparing.
[01:30:26.859 --> 01:30:28.659]  They've already declared them in California and other places.
[01:30:29.079 --> 01:30:33.079]  They want to hand Trump a total disaster when he gets into office in just 21 days.
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:35.279]  No, it's an info war.
[01:30:35.399 --> 01:30:36.180]  They're the crooks.
[01:30:36.279 --> 01:30:38.380]  We're going to expose them and we're going to stop it together.
[01:30:38.659 --> 01:30:43.779]  Remember the COVID tyranny of the last few years and imagine how much worse this new tyranny is going to be.
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:45.579]  These criminals must go to prison.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:47.119]  It's us or them.
[01:31:12.810 --> 01:31:16.229]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host today on The Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:17.170 --> 01:31:22.710]  In 23 minutes we'll be joined by Thomas Renz to talk about this bird flu pandemic.
[01:31:24.799 --> 01:31:25.439]  Unbelievable.
[01:31:25.439 --> 01:31:43.100]  Breaking news from Peter McCullough about a peer-reviewed study paper which showed that the current form of the bird flu is a result of gain-of-function research, not somewhere overseas, but here in the United States, where they intentionally made the flu transmissible between chickens and mallard ducks,
[01:31:43.279 --> 01:31:49.220]  which allowed the flu to spread from flock to flock to flock all over basically the continent.
[01:31:50.359 --> 01:32:06.000]  So they made it more infectious on purpose because And now they're hyping up the threat of it, despite the fact that between 2010 and 2014, three times the number of people were infected with the bird flu,
[01:32:06.199 --> 01:32:25.500]  as have been between 2020 and 2024. Despite the fact that the mortality rate of the bird flu, if you are a human being and get it, is not anywhere close to the 50-60% that the WHO or the CDC will say because they're citing Southeastern Countries with malnutrition,
[01:32:25.979 --> 01:32:31.239]  low iodine, not access to healthcare, sleeping with dead or dirty chickens.
[01:32:32.579 --> 01:32:49.180]  And they're trying to project that prognosis onto the American people so they can stoke fear, so they can weaponize this disease in the exact same way that they did in 2020. But the reason this one's even more dangerous than what they did in 2020 is because they have linked it to livestock itself,
[01:32:49.399 --> 01:32:51.140]  to poultry itself, to dairy itself.
[01:32:52.779 --> 01:33:01.140]  And so now what they want to do is not only regulate your life, social distancing, locking down, shutting down your business, wearing a mask, forcing you to get vaccinated.
[01:33:01.619 --> 01:33:08.220]  Now they want to take total control of the entire food supply in the United States of America, specifically all of the livestock.
[01:33:09.199 --> 01:33:12.600]  And the globalists have been talking about the importance of artificial meat for years.
[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:20.979]  Now they actually have a mechanism, a way, a tool, a lie that they can weaponize to justify total control of all agriculture.
[01:33:22.649 --> 01:33:44.329]  Seems to me in retrospect now that the $1.2 trillion omnibus bill that was suggested a couple of weeks ago, that it was no coincidence that it was simultaneously funding agriculture and expanding government powers in the face of a pandemic and funding no less than 12 biolabs.
[01:33:44.670 --> 01:33:46.329]  So they funded gain-of-function.
[01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:47.069]  They tried to anyway.
[01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.689]  It didn't pass.
[01:33:47.890 --> 01:33:49.289]  They tried to fund gain-of-function.
[01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:59.909]  They tried to fund and control agriculture and they tried to expand pandemic powers all in the same 1.2 trillion dollar bill just a couple of weeks ago.
[01:34:00.069 --> 01:34:03.430]  And now we have this bird flu which is intimately tied to all of those things.
[01:34:03.770 --> 01:34:06.789]  It's tied to the bio labs because it's a product of gain of function research.
[01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:13.750]  It's tied to agriculture because it's affecting livestock, blocks of chickens, even dairy.
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:25.199]  And it's affecting the pandemic because, by definition, this is a pandemic that they're trying to raise the alarm on, even though it's manufactured and exaggerated.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:39.000]  So what we are seeing here is not just a coincidence of incompetence or a crisis of competence or a crisis of confidence or just rampant, out-of-control government expansion.
[01:34:39.539 --> 01:34:41.140]  Those things to a certain extent.
[01:34:41.899 --> 01:34:49.689]  But all of the evidence points To the fact that this is an orchestrated, manufactured crisis.
[01:34:51.149 --> 01:35:00.449]  So the deep state can leverage this crisis against the Trump administration, which will pull the rug out from under it.
[01:35:01.739 --> 01:35:03.800]  We know that the deep state hates Donald Trump.
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:06.920]  We know that they used illegal warrants to spy on him.
[01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:10.000]  We know that they prosecuted and persecuted him based on nothing.
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:12.840]  We know the Russian collusion hoax was just that, a hoax.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.539]  We know the impeachments were a hoax.
[01:35:14.699 --> 01:35:22.539]  We know that J6 was an inside job, that it was entrapment, that it wasn't an insurrection, that he was just blamed for it for no reason.
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.649]  We know that all the charges against him wouldn't be brought by Any prosecutor on anyone else other than Donald Trump.
[01:35:28.850 --> 01:35:35.729]  We know that all of this is because the deep state hates Donald Trump because he is a threat to their political establishment.
[01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:48.750]  Which is good because while Joe Biden told us that the greatest threat to national security was white supremacy or domestic terrorism or right-wing extremism or MAGA republicanism.
[01:35:49.939 --> 01:35:56.399]  The real greatest threat to national security, to American security, is our own deep state.
[01:35:57.119 --> 01:36:04.020]  The CIA is the largest, most well-funded, sophisticated, competent terrorist organization in the history of terrorist organizations.
[01:36:04.819 --> 01:36:18.079]  The CIA, along with the NSA, along with the IRS, along with the FBI, along with the DOJ, has a tremendous amount of power and a total lack.
[01:36:18.710 --> 01:36:19.930]  Of accountability whatsoever.
[01:36:23.789 --> 01:36:42.109]  So if you're asking me whether I'm more afraid of the bird flu or the CIA, well, the answer is the CIA. If you're asking me whether I'm more afraid of Russia than the CIA, well, the answer is the CIA. After all, the CIA did fund an organization in Ukraine that put me on an enemies of the state list, along with Alex Jones and members of the staff in Peru, two to 300 other social media influencers,
[01:36:42.270 --> 01:36:42.710]  as they said.
[01:36:43.729 --> 01:37:00.750]  If you're asking me whether I'm more afraid of the CCP or the CIA, well, frankly, I'm more afraid of the CIA, an organization that has been caught time and time again, committing major massive atrocities against human beings,
[01:37:01.050 --> 01:37:02.750]  major violations of human rights.
[01:37:04.010 --> 01:37:16.010]  Going all the way back to JFK, the Gulf of Tonkin, the regime change after regime change, to MKUltra.
[01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:23.920]  To the Oklahoma City bombing, to 9-11, to the pandemic.
[01:37:25.119 --> 01:37:28.380]  I mean, this is the most dangerous organization that's ever existed on the planet.
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:35.079]  And they are waging a total covert war.
[01:37:36.939 --> 01:37:40.819]  On the Trump administration coming in, and not just Trump.
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:43.420]  It's not like they specifically hate Trump.
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:44.779]  They hate everything that he stands for.
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:52.340]  They hate the fact that he came to power because there's a real zeitgeist, a real movement, a real awakening happening in the United States of America and the world over.
[01:37:53.159 --> 01:38:01.960]  A realization that our ails are not a result of one political party versus another political party, but the people versus the political class.
[01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:15.149]  A class of supervillains Dead set on conglomerating all political power into one new world order through monetary systems, through military power, through conspiracy.
[01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:19.109]  Using the various deep states of the world.
[01:38:21.649 --> 01:38:22.609]  So what did they do?
[01:38:22.829 --> 01:38:23.770]  Well, they tried to imprison him.
[01:38:23.829 --> 01:38:24.149]  That didn't work.
[01:38:24.289 --> 01:38:25.010]  They tried to censor him.
[01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.609]  That didn't work.
[01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:27.710]  Tried to assassinate him twice.
[01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:29.750]  That didn't work.
[01:38:32.859 --> 01:38:33.739]  Well, now they're trying this.
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:37.460]  We started a war on November 5th when we elected Donald Trump to be the President of the United States.
[01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:40.579]  And the new world order is striking back.
[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:44.779]  The next four years are not gonna be easier than the last four.
[01:38:45.039 --> 01:38:47.420]  They will be better, but they will be more difficult.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:58.300]  Because right now, we are in a full-scale war with our own covert government, with our own deep state, with our own hidden government.
[01:38:59.689 --> 01:39:13.229]  And through funding and incentives and a massive web of conspiracy and corruption, they're weaponizing every facet of our civilization against us, against our freedoms.
[01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:26.810]  They're weaponizing our monetary system against us by inflating the dollar, printing inordinate amounts of money to kill your buying power and build up the stock portfolios of the political class.
[01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:30.630]  So economically speaking, they're attacking you full on.
[01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:49.569]  Militaristically speaking, they're taking you on because they're trying to get us into World War III. They're even attacking your family because they have made it so that you can't afford to raise and educate your own children for the most part on average.
[01:39:50.329 --> 01:39:57.449]  You have to outsource the raising of your children for at least eight hours a day from the ages of four through 23 or 22 to the state.
[01:39:58.979 --> 01:40:00.439]  So they've kidnapped your kids.
[01:40:00.899 --> 01:40:03.560]  They've opened your borders and allowed terrorists in.
[01:40:05.039 --> 01:40:11.079]  They've escalated us toward World War III, and they've totally destroyed all of your buying power.
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:13.579]  So you're financially dependent on them.
[01:40:14.739 --> 01:40:19.600]  And now the only thing left for them to do is take the rest.
[01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:21.659]  Now they want to control the food supply.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:23.060]  They want to control what you eat now.
[01:40:23.819 --> 01:40:38.909]  And what better way to do that than to manufacture through gain of function, A bird flu, which can transfer from flock to flock through mallard ducks, infecting cattle, livestock,
[01:40:39.149 --> 01:40:42.430]  poultry all over the country.
[01:40:45.689 --> 01:40:52.850]  So they can manifest this shortage, this crisis, and then offer a solution to a desperate populace.
[01:40:52.930 --> 01:41:00.659]  I mean, we know that in Ukraine under the Soviet Union, Of course, Ukraine is known as the breadbasket of Europe.
[01:41:00.659 --> 01:41:03.359]  It's amazing agriculture capabilities there.
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:08.260]  We know that under the Soviet Union, you can read Michael Malice's book, Red Pill.
[01:41:11.439 --> 01:41:19.720]  Soviet Union was taking all of the food that was being harvested in Ukraine and redistributing it.
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:25.439]  And if you didn't look like you were malnourished, They would kill you.
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:28.979]  If your kids didn't look like they were malnourished, they would kill them.
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:33.939]  If you stole food from your own field, they would kill you.
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:46.579]  And this happened for decades, massive amounts of starvation because of the redistribution of wealth and the centralization of all industry and a communist government.
[01:41:48.390 --> 01:42:05.609]  And because of that desperation, because of that massive starvation and injustice that the Ukrainian people faced under the Soviet Union, when the Nazis came in under Barbarossa to invade Russia, all the Ukrainians were delighted that they were being saved from the communists.
[01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:09.250]  That's why so many of them are still Nazi sympathizers today.
[01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:16.670]  That's why there's a cemetery in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania that has an iron cross and the Ukrainian trident on a statue in the middle of it.
[01:42:17.869 --> 01:42:24.810]  To honor Ukrainian soldiers who are members of the SS. Elkins Park, Pennsylvania.
[01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:45.010]  And so if these Ukrainians were willing to sign up and fight for the Nazis in World War II and still harbor a positive sentiment towards Nazism in a large degree, what do you think would happen in the United States if our people reached a similar level of desperation?
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:43:04.840]  If our people begin to starve, if they hijack the food supply, if they shut down the power grid, if they escalate to World War III, if they simultaneously activate all of these crises on all of these fronts at the same time, our people will be so desperate that they will sign up for anything.
[01:43:09.859 --> 01:43:13.079]  And that's why we can't let them get away with this bird flu and won't be the last thing.
[01:43:14.979 --> 01:43:21.539]  This is just one front of a multi-front attack on freedom and sovereignty and individualism.
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:36.479]  We can't let them weaponize the control they have remaining over the mainstream media narrative against our people so that we can be deceived and coerced into fear.
[01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:48.369]  To such an extent that we empower this government to sell out all of our interests to a global political class, resulting in the total subjugation of humanity.
[01:43:51.989 --> 01:43:53.729]  Let's look at clip number 65 here.
[01:43:54.069 --> 01:43:57.369]  Ursula von der Leyen commits to vaccinating millions.
[01:43:57.369 --> 01:43:57.890]  Let's watch.
[01:44:04.729 --> 01:44:08.430]  A better world also means a healthier world.
[01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:12.170]  And vaccination is our best chance to do this.
[01:44:13.069 --> 01:44:17.890]  Vaccines have saved millions of lives in the past 50 years.
[01:44:18.489 --> 01:44:23.270]  But right now, millions of children are still at risk.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.939]  They need vaccines.
[01:44:26.399 --> 01:44:31.180]  So we must continue to support vaccination around the world.
[01:44:31.659 --> 01:44:41.100]  And today, I am pleased to pledge $290 million for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
[01:44:42.359 --> 01:44:45.159]  Each child should be protected.
[01:44:46.479 --> 01:44:47.560]  And more will come.
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:58.380]  Together with Gavi, we have the goal to vaccinate 500 million children by 2030. Europe will do its fair share.
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:00.979]  You can count on us, my friends.
[01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:05.500]  I tell you what, Klaus Schwab is a Bond villain and Ursula is a supervillain name too.
[01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:07.479]  It's unbelievable.
[01:45:07.659 --> 01:45:09.319]  Here we have RFK speaking.
[01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:12.630]  Saying that he wouldn't in a million years take a flu shot.
[01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:16.689]  We know that flu shot's 50% effective at best, if at all.
[01:45:18.810 --> 01:45:20.170]  Probably totally harmful.
[01:45:20.489 --> 01:45:22.850]  Probably laced with all sorts of terrible things.
[01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:38.720]  And somehow, our government claims to already have a vaccine for the bird flu, which is not even transferred human to human, which has only caused the death of A couple hundred people over the last 50 years across the world.
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:42.300]  Let's watch what RFK has to say about flu shots.
[01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:46.460]  In a million years, I would not take the flu shot.
[01:45:46.619 --> 01:45:47.420]  And I'll tell you why.
[01:45:47.579 --> 01:45:49.859]  Because this is what Cochran and BMJ have found.
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:55.640]  People who take the flu shot are protected against a strain of flu.
[01:45:56.590 --> 01:46:00.949]  They're 4.4 times more likely to get a non-flu infection.
[01:46:01.409 --> 01:46:05.670]  And you might find, and a lot of people do, that they get the flu shot and then they get sick.
[01:46:05.890 --> 01:46:07.689]  They're usually not getting the flu.
[01:46:08.210 --> 01:46:15.810]  They're getting something that is indistinguishable from the flu because the flu shot gives you something called pathogenic priming.
[01:46:16.949 --> 01:46:24.729]  It injures your immune system so that you're more likely to get a non-flu viral upper respiratory infection.
[01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:41.960]  In fact, The Pentagon published a story, and you can cite this, it's by Wolf, W-O-L-F-E, in January of this year, in which they said the flu shot not only primes you for flu, but it primes you for coronavirus.
[01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:54.739]  They had a placebo group and they had a vaccine group because they wanted for military readiness to see if the flu shot was prophylactic against coronavirus.
[01:46:55.659 --> 01:47:01.819]  What they found is actually the people who got the flu shot were 36% more likely to get coronavirus.
[01:47:02.399 --> 01:47:04.960]  And that's not a lone study.
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:09.520]  We found six other major studies that say the same thing.
[01:47:09.979 --> 01:47:12.920]  So is your Alex Jones was right, Jar, overflowing?
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:16.699]  I mean, he's been talking about this for decades.
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:19.560]  He predicted all of this and others did too.
[01:47:21.079 --> 01:47:32.039]  This is all just a major big pharma money grab and it's a conspiracy because while the pharmaceutical companies make a tremendous amount of money and the political class also makes a tremendous amount of money because they're invested in the pharmaceutical companies.
[01:47:33.130 --> 01:47:36.430]  It also empowers the deep state to expand its own power.
[01:47:36.689 --> 01:47:49.590]  This is a perfect storm of corruption that we're witnessing right before our eyes, and the media is just publishing headline after headline after headline, saying that you should be afraid, you should sacrifice all of your rights because your cat might get sick, and one man in Louisiana got the flu.
[01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:53.130]  Let's watch clip number 66, Alex Jones was right.
[01:47:53.970 --> 01:47:56.010]  Yeah, we wanna start arresting people for their speech.
[01:47:56.810 --> 01:48:00.069]  What our science are, Cass Sunstein and others have said.
[01:48:01.199 --> 01:48:08.180]  And now they come to the point of saying, oh, you think you're gonna peacefully take the country back through the states and the legislatures and the Congress?
[01:48:08.359 --> 01:48:14.619]  You think you're the people and this is of the people, for the people, by the people, and you're gonna do what the founders said and what's totally legitimate?
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:16.500]  We're gonna stage terror attacks.
[01:48:16.659 --> 01:48:18.399]  We're gonna come after the American people.
[01:48:18.579 --> 01:48:20.279]  We're gonna start wars with you.
[01:48:20.439 --> 01:48:22.600]  We're not gonna let you peacefully take things back.
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:23.979]  We're gonna rape you.
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:26.119]  We're gonna steal everything you got.
[01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:31.489]  Because they know the average American is literally in a trance.
[01:48:31.789 --> 01:48:39.130]  You try to talk to adults out there, major scientific studies, it's on record that most adults have lower brain waves than people just 20 years ago.
[01:48:39.369 --> 01:48:41.369]  They are in a sleep state.
[01:48:41.869 --> 01:48:46.850]  You talk about glazed eyes, the general public is literally asleep.
[01:48:47.409 --> 01:48:52.930]  Because when you watch just a few minutes of television, the first time it takes an hour or more, the studies show.
[01:48:53.090 --> 01:48:58.819]  But once you learn to have suspend disbelief, When your eyes glaze over, your mouth hangs open, you start drooling.
[01:49:00.279 --> 01:49:07.140]  Once you get mesmerized, your brain waves lower to a sleepwalking state between waking and sleep.
[01:49:08.159 --> 01:49:09.520]  Totally suggestible.
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:13.199]  Folks, your neighbors are literally zombies now.
[01:49:13.399 --> 01:49:17.239]  They are literally biological androids.
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:19.720]  Do you understand that?
[01:49:19.899 --> 01:49:22.340]  That's why you can't get through to them.
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:26.800]  And they've put chemicals in the water that accentuate that, on record.
[01:49:27.819 --> 01:49:34.880]  And zombies listening right now laugh because they've been pre-programmed under hypnosis to laugh when they hear this.
[01:49:35.239 --> 01:49:36.859]  It's in Texas newspapers.
[01:49:37.159 --> 01:49:48.800]  There's uranium and radium and the government is putting it in there and zombies are listening and laughing because they're under a trance, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:49.720]  Do you understand?
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:50.699]  This is real.
[01:49:52.199 --> 01:49:55.220]  People laugh at this because they're under a trance.
[01:49:55.319 --> 01:49:57.199]  They've been given a hypnotic suggestion.
[01:49:58.659 --> 01:50:01.380]  You can see it in the shows where they make fun of all this stuff.
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:06.380]  Under a hypnotic suggestion, programming the centers of the brain associated with humor.
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:11.060]  They're literally laughing as they stumble off the cliff.
[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:14.239]  He's absolutely right.
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:18.680]  And the only way to cure the zombification of humanity...
[01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:27.489]  The NPC characteristics, symptoms that people have, the non-player characters that they are, the brainwashed state that they're in is the truth incessantly.
[01:50:27.789 --> 01:50:33.869]  You have to surround those who deny the truth with the truth until denial is no longer possible.
[01:50:34.590 --> 01:50:37.829]  It's the first stage of grief and it's a very tragic thing.
[01:50:37.970 --> 01:50:43.630]  It's a very traumatic thing to realize that your entire worldview has been wrong and that's why people are in denial.
[01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:48.140]  We have to get them through these stages of grief.
[01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:49.279]  We have to get them through this trauma.
[01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:50.340]  We have to expose the truth.
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:52.539]  That's why it's more important now than ever.
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:54.159]  That Alex Jones stays on the air.
[01:50:54.279 --> 01:50:55.859]  That Infowars stays on the air.

[01:52:57.479 --> 01:53:00.720]  So here's what Irish sea moss does, according to ChatGPT.
[01:53:00.899 --> 01:53:02.420]  Rich in nutrients.
[01:53:02.739 --> 01:53:06.659]  Contains 92 of the 102 essential minerals the body needs.

[01:53:14.859 --> 01:53:16.020]  Promotes thyroid function.
[01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:17.460]  Aids weight loss management.
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:18.960]  Improves energy levels.
[01:53:19.119 --> 01:53:20.520]  Supports respiratory health.
[01:53:20.819 --> 01:53:21.819]  That's just the sea moss.
[01:53:22.199 --> 01:53:23.300]  Now let's look at bladder rack.
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:24.579]  Thyroid support.
[01:53:24.979 --> 01:53:25.960]  Anti-inflammatory.
[01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:27.100]  Digestive aid.
[01:53:27.399 --> 01:53:28.199]  Rich in antioxidants.
[01:53:28.619 --> 01:53:29.479]  Skin health.
[01:53:29.739 --> 01:53:30.920]  Weight management.
[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:31.979]  Joint support.

[01:53:34.859 --> 01:53:36.020]  Now let's look at burdock root.
[01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:42.810]  We're good to go.
[01:53:43.350 --> 01:53:48.869]  We're good to go.
[01:53:49.289 --> 01:54:01.529]  We're good to go.

[01:55:04.619 --> 01:55:07.380]  I don't look into Anthony Fauci's head.
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.699]  I don't look into Bill Gates' head.
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:15.140]  I don't say he did this because he was greedy or because he was manipulative.
[01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:17.659]  I just lay out what they did.
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:19.800]  And the story speaks for itself.
[01:55:20.939 --> 01:55:31.819]  And, you know, it's a story of people involved in really terrible, terrible, immoral, Homicidal, criminal behavior.
[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:50.239]  And using a position in government that he had for 50 years without any election to clamp down these totalitarian controls that were not science-based and that everybody now admits there was no science.
[01:55:50.359 --> 01:56:09.810]  In fact, yesterday, the chief The attorney for FDA admitted that there was no reason, he admitted because he lost the case in court against a doctor, but there was no reason to discourage people from taking ivermectin.
[01:56:10.069 --> 01:56:14.609]  Ivermectin was a very, very devastating cure.
[01:56:15.949 --> 01:56:27.149]  Or COVID. It literally obliterated COVID. And, you know, by depriving people of ivermectin, many, many people, millions of people around the globe died.
[01:56:28.010 --> 01:56:29.289]  And they didn't need to.
[01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:33.369]  There were cures for COVID from day one, and very effective cures.
[01:56:33.890 --> 01:56:35.170]  But they didn't want that.
[01:56:35.310 --> 01:56:37.210]  They wanted the vaccine only.
[01:56:38.250 --> 01:56:44.810]  And there was a rule, you know, a little-known federal rule that they were all aware of.
[01:56:46.010 --> 01:56:58.010]  We said that you cannot issue an emergency use authorization for a vaccine if there is an existing remedy that has already been approved for any use.
[01:56:58.909 --> 01:57:15.979]  So if they admitted that hydroxychloroquine or famtidivine or ivermectin or any of the 25 existing therapeutic drugs that were very effective against COVID, if they admitted that any of them were effective, The whole vaccine project would have fallen apart.
[01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:17.199]  They couldn't have done it.
[01:57:17.819 --> 01:57:25.300]  And so they decided that they were going to pretend that there was no cure except for the vaccine.
[01:57:25.619 --> 01:57:29.640]  And they gave people a product that was not properly tested.
[01:57:29.859 --> 01:57:39.560]  And then now you have a whole generation of kids that has now, you know, got myocarditis, these terrible heart problems in young athletic boys.
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:47.640]  You're seeing so many kids now drop dead on playing fields, and we never saw anything like this before.
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:56.420]  On average, it was, I think, 29 a month globally, athletes who died on the field, and we were getting down to hundreds a month now.
[01:57:56.899 --> 01:58:01.640]  And there still has to be a reckoning.
[01:58:01.819 --> 01:58:04.500]  The mainstream media hasn't caught up with the science.
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:08.819]  The science is out there now, and it's devastating.
[01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:17.840]  If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus.
[01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:25.840]  If we get an airborne pandemic, if we haven't built ahead of time some Some structures to deal with this.
[01:58:26.239 --> 01:58:29.699]  Millions of people could be adversely impacted.
[01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:32.220]  But also there will be a surprise outbreak.
[01:58:32.399 --> 01:58:40.279]  The next administration that there's no doubt in anyone's mind that they will be faced with the challenges that their predecessors were faced with.
[01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:47.250]  Pandemic prevention and preparedness is gonna end up being, whether the administration likes it or not, a priority, a top priority.
[01:58:47.449 --> 01:58:49.010]  Trump is now president.
[01:58:49.390 --> 01:59:01.609]  When he faces his first major epidemic, as his predecessors have, he will likely project his impulsivity, xenophobia, and cavalier attitude towards facts to over 52 million followers.
[01:59:01.789 --> 01:59:07.350]  We may yet again have another pandemic, and it is almost inevitable that we will have another pandemic.
[01:59:07.590 --> 01:59:11.449]  Welcome to event 201. Of what's looking like it will be a severe pandemic.
[01:59:11.649 --> 01:59:12.729]  A new coronavirus.
[01:59:13.170 --> 01:59:19.229]  Why don't we blow this system up and then say, hey, everyone in the world should get this new vaccine we haven't given to anyone yet.
[01:59:19.390 --> 01:59:27.250]  But it is not too crazy to think that an outbreak of a novel avian virus could occur in China somewhere.
[01:59:27.470 --> 01:59:33.689]  We could get the RNA sequence from that and print those vaccines on a patch and self-administer.
[01:59:34.809 --> 01:59:38.050]  Biological attack is imminent, imminent.
[01:59:38.250 --> 01:59:39.189]  It's going to happen.
[01:59:39.329 --> 01:59:42.909]  It's not a question of will it happen, but when it happens.
[01:59:43.170 --> 01:59:54.590]  A bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to counter a global problem, and the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[01:59:54.729 --> 02:00:01.069]  This is a biological warfare agent that had leaked out of the Wuhan laboratory.
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.539]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host today on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:13.140]  Before the war room begins at 3 p.m., I believe Maria Z is going to be hosting the war room.
[02:00:13.239 --> 02:00:16.319]  I am joined by the esteemed Thomas Renz.
[02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:33.680]  Mr. Renz's experience with the law began with his mentor, Nuremberg prosecutor, and celebrated international lawyer Henry T. King, Jr., Thomas Renz is the lead attorney in several major cases brought in Ohio,
[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:47.500]  New Mexico, Maine, and nationally against the CDC, DHHS, and even Anthony Fauci regarding forced vaccine mandates, big tech censorship, COVID-19 lockdowns, mask mandates, business closures, false PCR data, fraudulent death numbers, and more.
[02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:50.239]  Thomas, it is an honor and a pleasure to be with you.
[02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:52.079]  Thank you so much for joining me today on The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:52.689 --> 02:00:53.729]  Glad to be here.
[02:00:53.829 --> 02:00:54.489]  How are you doing today?
[02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.949]  I'm doing well.
[02:00:56.189 --> 02:00:59.989]  So, the major topic of conversation is this bird flu.
[02:01:00.369 --> 02:01:03.550]  And we spoke with Dr. Peter McCullough earlier in the program today.
[02:01:03.850 --> 02:01:18.689]  It appears that there was some gain-of-function research that was conducted on the original strand of this bird flu that made it so that it would infect mallard ducks from poultry, and the mallard ducks could spread it from flock to flock all across the continent.
[02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:20.840]  And so we've got this spread happening.
[02:01:21.079 --> 02:01:26.720]  It's impacting large swaths of chickens apparently, although there haven't been that many deaths.
[02:01:26.899 --> 02:01:36.340]  It's still not transferred human to human, but every single headline seems to be really hyping up this pandemic that no one's dying from.
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:37.439]  What's going on?
[02:01:37.899 --> 02:01:41.359]  Well, they're trying to recreate the COVID pandemic, right?
[02:01:41.479 --> 02:01:52.750]  So you had $14 trillion with a T that changed hands in the United States alone from COVID. Nobody's gone to jail yet, and nothing truly has been done to stop it.
[02:01:52.829 --> 02:01:55.289]  Now, I think that's about to change with this new administration.
[02:01:55.850 --> 02:02:02.390]  But until there's some accountability and some truth out there, you can bank on the fact they're going to continue.
[02:02:02.850 --> 02:02:04.529]  I want to read you this.
[02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:07.789]  This is from Governor Gavin Newsom, who we all love.
[02:02:08.329 --> 02:02:09.710]  I say that jokingly.
[02:02:11.449 --> 02:02:14.850]  Newsom declared an emergency in California over the bird flu.
[02:02:15.729 --> 02:02:20.130]  Nationally, there are a grand total of 65 cases of bird flu in humans.
[02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:26.069]  Basically, what we're seeing is 65 cases, one hospitalization, that's it.
[02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:28.130]  Newsom is declaring an emergency.
[02:02:28.369 --> 02:02:28.689]  Why?
[02:02:28.949 --> 02:02:32.270]  Well, let me read you from his, this is from his emergency declaration.
[02:02:32.750 --> 02:02:41.890]  Quote, to date, no person-to-person spread of bird flu has been detected in California, and nearly all infected individuals had exposure to infected cattle.
[02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:46.710]  Okay, so basically the bird flu is a non-issue, but he's declaring an emergency.
[02:02:47.930 --> 02:02:54.050]  Meanwhile, you've got Deborah Birx out there and Leanna Wen out there talking about, well, we need to be testing.
[02:02:54.789 --> 02:02:59.010]  Well, let's go back to COVID because we don't need to reinvent the wheel.
[02:02:59.149 --> 02:03:00.029]  We can tell you why.
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:03.300]  They want mass PCR testing.
[02:03:03.439 --> 02:03:07.140]  PCR testing cannot diagnose a disease.
[02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:09.279]  We learned that during COVID. It was in court.
[02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:10.460]  We've put it everywhere.
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:12.000]  It's indisputable.
[02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:15.539]  You cannot diagnose disease with a PCR test.
[02:03:15.699 --> 02:03:42.420]  All you can do is see whether or not there's a certain level of viral load in a What's the viral load in a person's blood?
[02:03:43.399 --> 02:04:03.119]  They need mass testing so they can claim that there are all these cases of bird flu to justify emergencies, to justify lockdowns, to justify masks, and most importantly, to justify them giving authorization to untested and unproven mRNA vaccines that will do the same thing or worse than the COVID vaccines.
[02:04:04.300 --> 02:04:04.840]  Unbelievable.
[02:04:05.079 --> 02:04:08.579]  Now, I'm told that a vaccine already exists for the bird flu.
[02:04:08.659 --> 02:04:11.199]  I believe it was Yen who said this recently.
[02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:23.640]  Yeah, well, not only does it, we spent $176 million with Moderna this summer to basically pay them to build up their manufacturing capacity for a vaccine that hasn't even been approved.
[02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:27.220]  This was prior to even starting phase three clinical trials.
[02:04:27.439 --> 02:04:30.659]  We spent $176 million with them, right?
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:33.180]  So, now understand something.
[02:04:34.119 --> 02:04:37.119]  These haven't even undergone phase 3 clinical trials.
[02:04:37.319 --> 02:04:38.380]  Why is that important?
[02:04:39.359 --> 02:04:42.560]  The testing process has really been a disaster.
[02:04:42.739 --> 02:04:47.479]  So first of all, understand, all mRNA is gene therapy.
[02:04:47.739 --> 02:04:53.020]  Okay, gene therapy, and let me explain to you why, because experts will say, no, it's not, no, it's not.
[02:04:53.199 --> 02:04:55.840]  Okay, mRNA is genetic material.
[02:04:56.439 --> 02:05:00.640]  You are injecting mRNA into your arm for a therapeutic purpose.
[02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:02.800]  How is that not gene therapy?
[02:05:03.649 --> 02:05:05.569]  It's absolutely gene therapy, right?
[02:05:05.869 --> 02:05:18.149]  And whether it integrates into your DNA or not, something that we're now finding out that they did because SV40 contamination is less relevant than whether or not it is a gene therapy by definition.
[02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.810]  It is.
[02:05:19.130 --> 02:05:31.109]  Now, we know because I have the FDA documents that show that with gene therapies, there is the potential for what's called a delayed adverse event, delayed adverse reactions.
[02:05:31.779 --> 02:05:43.920]  That means that three, five, ten years down the road, you can get, according to the FDA, autoimmune disorders, you can get issues with cancer, all sorts of different things.
[02:05:44.159 --> 02:05:49.960]  Now, we don't know what or what's going on with it, but what we do know is that this is a very serious thing.
[02:05:50.670 --> 02:05:53.729]  And that the result of this is what we're seeing.
[02:05:53.829 --> 02:05:56.189]  I think this is the result of the turbo cancer we're seeing.
[02:05:56.289 --> 02:05:57.649]  I think it's safe to say that.
[02:05:57.829 --> 02:06:00.170]  Now, you can't do long-term studies.
[02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:03.250]  Long-term studies on these take 10, 20 years to do.
[02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:10.350]  The first set of mRNA vaccines came out in 2020. We're not at 10 years yet, so there are no long-term studies.
[02:06:10.689 --> 02:06:19.689]  So now, you have Leanna Wen and other big pharma shills out there pushing to skip even the early short-stage studies.
[02:06:25.699 --> 02:06:40.779]  We're going to put something out there that's going to kill and maim hundreds of thousands or millions for a disease that isn't even making people sick.
[02:06:41.699 --> 02:06:43.039]  So let me ask you this.
[02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:47.539]  Is the vaccine that they claim to have for the bird flu an mRNA vaccine specifically?
[02:06:48.329 --> 02:06:48.850]  Absolutely.
[02:06:49.090 --> 02:06:51.609]  The Moderna mRNA vaccine is an mRNA vaccine.
[02:06:51.869 --> 02:06:58.569]  Now, understand, we use mRNA right now as kind of this catch-all.
[02:06:59.390 --> 02:07:13.310]  The reality is, as Pfizer's admitted, that their mRNA is not actually messenger RNA. So when you say mRNA, most people think messenger RNA. Messenger RNA is something that is in every human being out there, and that's from my Substack.
[02:07:13.409 --> 02:07:16.130]  Please make sure you're checking it out, timerants.substack.com.
[02:07:18.719 --> 02:07:22.100]  Messenger RNA is in every living being, right?
[02:07:22.579 --> 02:07:23.920]  Messenger RNA is just part of us.
[02:07:24.399 --> 02:07:36.439]  Pfizer admitted in their documents that the Pfizer vaccines are not messenger RNA. They're mod RNA. And all of these vaccines are mod RNA. And what that means, the difference is huge.
[02:07:37.039 --> 02:07:39.699]  Again, messenger RNA is something that naturally occurs.
[02:07:40.539 --> 02:07:42.739]  Mod RNA is something created in the laboratory.
[02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:52.800]  You're putting this modified RNA that does not exist in nature in your arm, and it's doing something in your body, right?
[02:07:53.079 --> 02:08:02.810]  Now, we know that part of what it does is it forces you to create the spike protein, which is the pathogen from COVID. So for the COVID jabs, we know it's bad.
[02:08:03.050 --> 02:08:05.430]  But what else it does, you know, is unclear.
[02:08:05.649 --> 02:08:07.170]  We haven't had long-term testing.
[02:08:07.409 --> 02:08:09.770]  A lot of the safety tests were bypassed.
[02:08:09.909 --> 02:08:12.470]  Nobody really knows or understands how this stuff works.
[02:08:12.649 --> 02:08:14.170]  There's a ton of guesswork.
[02:08:14.869 --> 02:08:22.970]  The trials, the clinical trials, the more stuff coming out from the clinical trials from the Pfizer documents and other such stuff that we find, the worse it looks.
[02:08:23.609 --> 02:08:25.810]  They bypassed, they skipped everything.
[02:08:25.970 --> 02:08:27.470]  And they're not really liable.
[02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:29.319]  No, they're not.
[02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:30.539]  They're certainly not liable.
[02:08:30.699 --> 02:08:36.420]  In fact, they were released, the messenger RNA vaccines were released by our military.
[02:08:36.699 --> 02:08:40.880]  So Pfizer didn't actually, when you got your Pfizer vaccine, you weren't getting it from Pfizer.
[02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:45.300]  Pfizer sold it to the military, and then the military distributed it.
[02:08:45.439 --> 02:08:48.020]  So if you want to sue, you have to sue the military.
[02:08:48.319 --> 02:08:58.000]  I mean, you can't even do that if you want to, because you have the The law that prohibits you from suing anybody on it.
[02:08:58.819 --> 02:09:01.560]  There's so many layers of liability protection, it's ridiculous.
[02:09:01.819 --> 02:09:06.340]  So they're not safe, they're not effective, because if they were, why do you need so much liability protection?
[02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:15.579]  Second of all, if they release them under emergency use authorization, they're going to continue to do it under PREP Act and this, that, and other with all this immunity so no one can sue them.
[02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:32.109]  I mean, there's layers and layers on this, but yet, Leanna Nguyen Tom is out there advocating for us to release something that has not completed safety tests using a platform that's already demonstrably unsafe.
[02:09:32.569 --> 02:09:35.789]  The mRNA platform has been demonstrably unsafe to this point.
[02:09:36.170 --> 02:09:42.430]  She doesn't want to continue safety tests for a disease that's hit 65 people in the entire United States.
[02:09:42.710 --> 02:09:43.890]  What are you thinking?
[02:09:44.829 --> 02:09:49.810]  Tom, let's run that clip of Yen and unpack it on the other side that you mentioned.
[02:09:49.949 --> 02:09:50.449]  Let's see.
[02:09:51.239 --> 02:09:54.460]  What should be happening in the Biden administration right now that isn't going on?
[02:09:54.850 --> 02:09:58.489]  Yeah, there are two main things that they should be doing in the days that they have left.
[02:09:58.670 --> 02:10:00.770]  The first is to get testing out there.
[02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:06.970]  I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that just because we aren't testing, it doesn't mean that the virus isn't there.
[02:10:07.109 --> 02:10:08.689]  It just means that we aren't looking for it.
[02:10:08.810 --> 02:10:21.729]  We should be having rapid tests, home tests available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not.
[02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:35.680]  We're good to go.
[02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:55.039]  So, and to farm workers and to vulnerable people, I think that's the right approach because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu.
[02:10:55.220 --> 02:11:04.470]  If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization if they don't want to know how much Bird flu is out there.
[02:11:04.630 --> 02:11:05.609]  Could they withhold testing?
[02:11:05.930 --> 02:11:07.750]  I mean, that's a possibility.
[02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:19.630]  And I think the Biden administration in the remaining days should get testing and vaccines widely available so that at least it empowers state and local health officials and clinicians to do the right thing for their patients.
[02:11:19.770 --> 02:11:21.409]  Dr. Nguyen, is bird flu in humans?
[02:11:21.670 --> 02:11:21.729]  All right.
[02:11:21.829 --> 02:11:22.550]  What do you think of that?
[02:11:23.579 --> 02:11:25.800]  Well, I mean, it's an absolute absurdity.
[02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:31.399]  So first of all, when she says that the FDA has the authority to do this, sure, under emergency use authorization.
[02:11:31.659 --> 02:11:33.460]  But what emergency is there?
[02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:35.000]  There is no emergency.
[02:11:35.319 --> 02:11:36.579]  65 cases.
[02:11:36.939 --> 02:11:42.460]  65. In what planet can anybody suggest that that's an actual emergency?
[02:11:43.039 --> 02:11:45.840]  This woman is so...
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:49.560]  Now, by the way, are you aware that she actually led Planned Parenthood?
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:50.579]  No, I'm not.
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:55.199]  So she was president of Planned Parenthood for about a minute.
[02:11:55.739 --> 02:12:01.640]  So the woman that's out there telling us how we have to protect the kids was in charge of Planned Parenthood.
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:03.279]  I think that's an interesting thing.
[02:12:04.039 --> 02:12:10.880]  But this woman is talking about using emergency powers to bypass safety testing.
[02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:18.010]  So you can get something out there that we don't know is safe to protect people from a virus that's not an issue.
[02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:19.369]  It's insanity.
[02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:22.649]  There's another aspect of this, though, that's critical.
[02:12:23.710 --> 02:12:28.229]  I don't want to overlook that she opened up talking about the testing.
[02:12:29.369 --> 02:12:38.670]  Predicate to them being able to get away with their lies about this being an emergency is that everybody starts getting PCR tests again.
[02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:46.399]  If they PCR test everything, the thing about PCR is if you run it at a high enough cycle threshold, you'll find anything you want to find.
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:47.899]  They admitted that.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:56.220]  We found that during COVID. So they can find exposure to anything they want to find if they run a certain type of PCR test at a certain type of cycle threshold.
[02:12:56.569 --> 02:13:01.930]  So they want testing because then they can say, there's 100 million cases of the bird flu.
[02:13:02.090 --> 02:13:02.869]  We're all going to die.
[02:13:03.050 --> 02:13:09.989]  And everybody that dies, they can label a bird flu death, just like they did with COVID. Then they can try and mandate the flu vaccines.
[02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:13.050]  Now, this is where it becomes really insidious.
[02:13:13.989 --> 02:13:23.390]  The law around COVID vaccines is different than the law around flu vaccines because there were no COVID vaccines 10 years ago.
[02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:26.539]  Flu vaccines have been out for a long time.
[02:13:27.199 --> 02:13:38.039]  And the crooks at the Biden FDA have for the last several years been trying to kind of mesh the authorization for the flu vaccine with authorization for mRNA.
[02:13:38.690 --> 02:13:49.470]  Because if they have an mRNA flu vaccine, they're going to try and say that they can mandate it in the same way that they used to be able to traditionally mandate flu vaccines.
[02:13:49.689 --> 02:13:58.489]  And under the law, there are certain situations where, for example, healthcare workers and stuff, they've got a lot of latitude to try and force those vaccines.
[02:14:02.519 --> 02:14:15.859]  So they're trying to mesh this and get this into the flu vaccine so that they can get away with trying to use the law for a traditional vaccine to mandate this mRNA poison because they want to force it in everybody's arm.
[02:14:16.729 --> 02:14:21.850]  What I don't understand, and I'm somebody who, at this point, I'm just never going to get another vaccine no matter what.
[02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:29.970]  Regardless if it's safe, regardless of whether it works, I'd rather risk getting measles or bubonic than ever get a vaccine because I've just lost all trust.
[02:14:30.250 --> 02:14:39.569]  I was somebody before 2020 that, yeah, if I cut my thumb on a rusty knife, I would have immediately gone and gotten a tetanus shot, which now I've kind of learned is totally stupid.
[02:14:39.949 --> 02:14:49.229]  That being said, for decades, the experts in healthcare and And legal fields have said that vaccines have been safe and effective.
[02:14:49.590 --> 02:14:54.630]  All the different vaccines, the dozens upon dozens of different vaccines that we offer, that we schedule our children to take.
[02:14:54.890 --> 02:14:59.829]  And it's just in the last few years that we've seen this major push for the mRNA vaccine.
[02:14:59.949 --> 02:15:12.989]  So my question is, why is it that the industry is so gung-ho, dead-set, determined to push these mRNA vaccines instead of developing another more traditional vaccine?
[02:15:14.039 --> 02:15:17.079]  Well, they're cheaper to build and to roll out.
[02:15:17.199 --> 02:15:18.380]  They can roll them out faster.
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:22.199]  And yeah, I think that they also cause a number of...
[02:15:22.199 --> 02:15:26.319]  Nobody really knows what's in these or how they work or what's happening.
[02:15:26.479 --> 02:15:31.500]  And I think that there's so many health issues that are associated with it, and some of them are really delayed.
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:34.000]  They make big pharma customers for life.
[02:15:34.199 --> 02:15:36.640]  Once you've taken these, you're a permanent big pharma customer.
[02:15:36.859 --> 02:15:38.380]  I mean, that's just kind of the way it's going.
[02:15:39.239 --> 02:15:41.279]  I think the big thing to remember here...
[02:15:42.050 --> 02:15:45.869]  So in 2021, I came on this show with Alex, right?
[02:15:46.449 --> 02:15:52.770]  And we talked about a few things that I think are absolutely vital for people to remember, and I want to reiterate one thing.
[02:15:53.890 --> 02:16:01.329]  So back then, we talked about, they still were disputing it, but I brought on evidence and I said, okay, masks don't work.
[02:16:01.489 --> 02:16:03.289]  Social distancing is made up, right?
[02:16:03.550 --> 02:16:06.789]  And we now know that masks don't work and social distancing is made up.
[02:16:07.140 --> 02:16:09.359]  We brought on evidence about issues with vaccines.
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:15.180]  So what we did was we brought on hard evidence proving that the government was lying about things.
[02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:21.420]  And the best example is social distancing because they've now admitted that they literally made that up out of thin air.
[02:16:21.619 --> 02:16:22.539]  It was garbage.
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:23.439]  It was always garbage.
[02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:35.299]  And we talked about that and I said to Alex, and I've been saying this since 2021, I have for five years now been proving these people are liars with evidence.
[02:16:35.969 --> 02:16:37.110]  I don't need science.
[02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:38.069]  I don't need anything.
[02:16:38.069 --> 02:16:39.350]  I use their words.
[02:16:39.530 --> 02:16:44.250]  I give you their document that says one thing and I show you their words that say another.
[02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:48.329]  So either they lied when they wrote the documents or they lied when they spoke.
[02:16:49.010 --> 02:16:52.590]  I don't even care when they lied because here's the point.
[02:16:53.149 --> 02:16:57.309]  If they've lied, I ask everybody this question.
[02:16:57.809 --> 02:16:59.569]  When do you trust a liar?
[02:17:00.729 --> 02:17:16.190]  And the federal government, big pharma, the mainstream media, I only have to prove to you a handful of instances before I say, how many times do you trust a liar?
[02:17:16.629 --> 02:17:18.870]  They've lied more times than I can count.
[02:17:19.209 --> 02:17:35.079]  At this point, the most important thing we need to ask ourselves is how many times are you going to trust people that are making millions, if not billions, if not trillions of dollars off of lying to you before you start saying, I'm an idiot.
[02:17:35.340 --> 02:17:36.559]  I keep trusting liars.
[02:17:36.879 --> 02:17:37.760]  What am I doing?
[02:17:38.260 --> 02:17:39.700]  That's what's happening here.
[02:17:39.860 --> 02:17:42.479]  And that's the message that everybody needs to be asking themselves.
[02:17:43.260 --> 02:17:45.180]  So it's obvious.
[02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:50.200]  It's common sense that I think?
[02:17:51.180 --> 02:18:02.979]  I think?
[02:18:08.659 --> 02:18:23.200]  Entire economy crashes between 2006 and 2008. I think maybe one banker was prosecuted and the entire corrupt litany of financial industry leaders that were involved.
[02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:24.559]  So how?
[02:18:25.430 --> 02:18:32.350]  Can we hold these people accountable when they have legally protected themselves from liability, whether it's the pharmaceutical companies?
[02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:41.409]  I mean, we literally had Fauci lying to Congress about gain-of-function research and whether we were funding it and getting caught in the lie based off of his own emails.
[02:18:41.409 --> 02:18:49.170]  Just like you said, I just say what they wrote and then I say what they said and they were either lying in one of these We catch them all the time and red handed.
[02:18:49.350 --> 02:18:52.809]  It's not even speculation or conjecture or circumstantial evidence.
[02:18:52.969 --> 02:18:53.670]  It's not even weird.
[02:18:53.870 --> 02:18:55.569]  It's like obvious you lied.
[02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:57.909]  How do we hold these people accountable?
[02:18:59.069 --> 02:18:59.190]  Yeah.
[02:18:59.510 --> 02:19:02.790]  So, I mean, there's a number of ways that this can happen.
[02:19:03.250 --> 02:19:06.889]  The most important thing right now is that we've got a new administration coming in.
[02:19:06.989 --> 02:19:12.670]  We've got Bobby coming in at HHS. And Bobby's talking about getting to true science, right?
[02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:15.750]  He's not saying we're going to get rid of this or get rid of that.
[02:19:15.790 --> 02:19:17.129]  He said he wants to get to the truth.
[02:19:17.250 --> 02:19:18.750]  And that's what we have to do, right?
[02:19:19.389 --> 02:19:20.989]  The truth will set us free.
[02:19:21.370 --> 02:19:23.389]  And there may be times where we were wrong.
[02:19:23.790 --> 02:19:24.930]  I don't think there are.
[02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:26.450]  I think we've been pretty spot on.
[02:19:26.950 --> 02:19:28.209]  But, you know, there may be.
[02:19:28.719 --> 02:19:31.260]  The thing that we have to do, though, is we have to get to the truth.
[02:19:31.500 --> 02:19:36.360]  And once we get the truth out there, there will be ways to hold these people accountable on certain levels.
[02:19:36.819 --> 02:19:39.219]  Now, we have to also have some political will.
[02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:54.680]  But I think that as the Trump administration comes in, and as they start to see exactly how badly they were lied to and manipulated, and how badly all this stuff that was done was done with the intent,
[02:19:55.260 --> 02:20:01.379]  the absolute intent, Sure.
[02:20:08.159 --> 02:20:09.559]  Sure.
[02:20:09.979 --> 02:20:10.299]  Sure.
[02:20:12.899 --> 02:20:12.899]  Sure.
[02:20:23.459 --> 02:20:35.420]  That, you know, that he and the administration will decide that, you know, they need to leverage some of that mandate that they were given was such a huge win to open the door to some real accountability.
[02:20:36.180 --> 02:20:47.440]  I will tell you on the private side, you know, as an attorney looking at this on the outside, I do think that if enough evidence becomes available, there are certain actions that we can take.
[02:20:48.309 --> 02:20:52.889]  You know, to hold these people accountable civilly and things like that.
[02:20:53.889 --> 02:20:55.489]  That's going to take—there's more.
[02:20:55.610 --> 02:20:56.549]  We need more evidence.
[02:20:56.549 --> 02:20:57.270]  We need more of this.
[02:20:57.329 --> 02:20:57.870]  We need more of that.
[02:20:57.930 --> 02:20:58.870]  But we're not far off.
[02:20:58.950 --> 02:20:59.969]  And we're getting closer.
[02:20:59.969 --> 02:21:03.909]  And we're seeing some of these companies get held accountable for ignoring religious exemptions.
[02:21:04.329 --> 02:21:07.010]  And we're seeing success in the courts in some places.
[02:21:07.170 --> 02:21:08.750]  That'll continue to ramp up.
[02:21:08.969 --> 02:21:14.850]  And then as more evidence and more data comes out, that will not just ramp up, but it should explode.
[02:21:15.149 --> 02:21:20.170]  And so I'm real hopeful that over the next four years, we should be able to get a few things done.
[02:21:21.489 --> 02:21:23.930]  Well, Tom, it's been an honor and a pleasure to have you on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:24.030 --> 02:21:24.989]  Thank you so much for joining me.
[02:21:25.110 --> 02:21:26.649]  I think your insight is incredibly valuable.
[02:21:26.649 --> 02:21:28.049]  I've learned a lot from this conversation.
[02:21:28.229 --> 02:21:45.350]  I want to encourage the audience to follow him on X at RenzTom, that's R-E-N-Z-T-O-M, or on Substack, TomRenz, T-O-M-R-E-N-Z.substack.com, or you can go to Renz-Law, R-E-N-Z-Law.com to show your support.
[02:21:45.469 --> 02:21:47.569]  Any final thoughts in the last 20 seconds that we have, Tom?
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:49.479]  Well, we got rid of Ren's dashboard.
[02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:53.159]  We're at tomrens.com now, so please support us at tomrens.com.
[02:21:53.760 --> 02:22:00.040]  Listen, at the end of the day, they're going to try and do this again, and it ultimately comes down to our willingness to participate.
[02:22:00.059 --> 02:22:07.399]  If you're going to go out there and let them do PCR testing, if you're going to go out there and wear a mask, if you're going to participate in these lockdowns, well...
[02:22:08.099 --> 02:22:09.520]  It'll work if you let it work.
[02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:12.920]  It's going to come down to we the people saying not just no, but hell no.
[02:22:13.159 --> 02:22:15.020]  And so I urge you to all stand strong.
[02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:18.120]  Ask yourself and ask the people who are on the fence.
[02:22:18.959 --> 02:22:19.899]  They lied to you.
[02:22:20.100 --> 02:22:21.200]  Compliance is violence, Tom.
[02:22:21.479 --> 02:22:22.620]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:22:23.079 --> 02:22:31.940]  My fellow Americans, my fellow InfoWarriors, we are announcing something right now that is one of the most exciting things we've ever done in the history of financing the InfoWar.

[02:22:53.879 --> 02:22:55.440]  The globalists absolutely hate it.

[02:23:00.639 --> 02:23:03.120]  A total 360 win at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:23:03.959 --> 02:23:11.659]  Health expert Dr. Nguyen calls for Biden regime to approve 5 million doses of bird flu vaccines before Trump takes office.
[02:23:12.239 --> 02:23:15.780]  She even stated in the clip that we gotta get it done before the inauguration.
[02:23:15.979 --> 02:23:18.059]  We gotta get these emergency measures done.
[02:23:18.799 --> 02:23:22.180]  Joe Biden's gotta do it because if Trump gets into office, they're never gonna let it happen.
[02:23:23.540 --> 02:23:44.959]  The woman who formerly led Planned Parenthood Which, of course, has killed more people than every war of the 20th century, is now saying that because of an emergency, we should create an emergency by launching an emergency vaccine on the public for a disease virtually no one has ever had and no one is dying from.
[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:50.139]  Alex Jones has a report for you now on Dr. Wen and...
[02:23:50.430 --> 02:24:07.590]  The likes of her and her ilk, Anthony Fauci, others who have manufactured pandemic after pandemic, crisis after crisis, and then exploited the fear and vulnerability of the people to line their own pockets and empower the government to conglomerate all power and subject of humanity.
[02:24:07.729 --> 02:24:08.329]  Let's hear from Alex.
[02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:13.149]  The globalist COVID tyrants are making their move again.
[02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:18.389]  But this time, the people of the world are awake and are standing up against it.
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:30.819]  The last five years of their criminal power grab has already blown up in their face, but they're so desperate, they have no other moves to make and are trying to run the same play again.
[02:24:31.139 --> 02:24:33.780]  This is going to be their Waterloo.
[02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:37.600]  If we get the facts and raise the alarm to the people of the world now.
[02:24:57.690 --> 02:25:00.870]  Dr. Nguyen, is bird flu in humans super dangerous?
[02:25:01.709 --> 02:25:09.010]  Well, the World Health Organization estimates that in prior outbreaks of the bird flu, that the mortality rate is 52%.
[02:25:09.010 --> 02:25:10.129]  52%.
[02:25:10.129 --> 02:25:18.930]  However, in this most recent outbreak, it seems that most cases have been mild, and maybe some people even have asymptomatic infection.
[02:25:19.170 --> 02:25:24.090]  But the question is, we don't know what happens when bird flu affects more vulnerable individuals.
[02:25:24.389 --> 02:25:36.629]  People infected so far in the U.S. have been mainly farm workers who are working, presumably generally healthy, as opposed to what happens when you get to children, to pregnant women, to older individuals with chronic illnesses.
[02:25:36.909 --> 02:25:41.729]  We don't know how deadly, how dangerous bird flu is going to be for those individuals.
[02:25:41.870 --> 02:25:45.709]  And again, that's one more reason why we don't want it to spread and acquire more mutations.
[02:25:46.170 --> 02:26:01.930]  Dr. Lina Nguyen, the former head of Planned Parenthood, a top big pharma propagandist for CNN, has now emerged with the former COVID czar, Dr. Birx, Peter Hotez, the head of the WHO,
[02:26:02.549 --> 02:26:05.809]  Tedros, and said, we need a global emergency.
[02:26:06.489 --> 02:26:23.590]  And we need you to take these experimental H5N1 bird flu so-called vaccines, even though mainline science says it will cause leaky vaccine, or the technical term, an accelerated evolution of the virus is actually having it jump.
[02:26:24.209 --> 02:26:24.829]  Into humans.
[02:26:24.989 --> 02:26:27.469]  I mean, this is insane what they're trying.
[02:26:27.649 --> 02:26:30.190]  But I wanted to remind you of some of the tyranny.
[02:26:30.409 --> 02:26:35.750]  How she called for people to be force injected, people to be arrested that didn't take shots, and for children to wear masks forever.
[02:26:36.989 --> 02:26:38.370]  This is a tyrant.
[02:26:38.629 --> 02:26:44.290]  And this lady is emblematic of people like Fauci that need to be in prison.
[02:26:44.510 --> 02:26:50.350]  Now, after three plus years of her lying to the public, she came out and apologized later for the lockdowns and all of it.
[02:26:50.450 --> 02:27:04.469]  But now she's back again lying to the public and saying we need PCR tests for all these workers and all these farm workers and all these people so they get false positives by turning up the PCR test as the inventor warned they were doing.
[02:27:04.959 --> 02:27:09.159]  To create the false positives, to then create the mass hysteria.
[02:27:09.219 --> 02:27:15.760]  So I wanted to just show you some of the incredible, tyrannical things that she said and that she pushed.
[02:27:15.899 --> 02:27:16.899]  She's given a script.
[02:27:17.079 --> 02:27:18.840]  They're all reading off the same script.
[02:27:19.079 --> 02:27:26.360]  And it goes from Bill Gates to Fauci, right down to people like Hotez and Tedros and Borla of Pfizer.
[02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:27.379]  They need to be in prison.
[02:27:27.500 --> 02:27:29.459]  Remember, the head of Pfizer mRNA.
[02:27:30.459 --> 02:27:37.079]  And others got caught by James O'Keefe admitting they're creating new viruses and new strains to make money.
[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:38.379]  But that's only one level.
[02:27:38.479 --> 02:27:39.479]  It's about depopulation.
[02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:40.680]  It's about power.
[02:27:40.780 --> 02:27:41.879]  It's about control.
[02:27:42.139 --> 02:27:45.500]  It's about derailing the populist revolution happening worldwide.
[02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:46.739]  So here's some more.
[02:27:46.950 --> 02:27:48.590]  of this tyrannical witch.
[02:27:48.790 --> 02:27:55.069]  Everybody needs to expose this because they're trying to run the same scam again right now, but we're not naive this time.
[02:27:55.209 --> 02:28:02.770]  We're going to stop them and we're going to send them to prison so they can't pull more of this crap in the future, which I warned you they're going to try and they're trying again right now.
[02:28:02.959 --> 02:28:05.680]  Frankly, we know that we can't trust the unvaccinated.
[02:28:05.819 --> 02:28:08.379]  There is the anti-science, anti-vaxxer contingent.
[02:28:08.479 --> 02:28:17.059]  But I think that there are many more people, millions of people, who, for whatever reason, have concerns about the vaccine, who just don't know what's in it for them.
[02:28:17.219 --> 02:28:22.319]  And we need to make it clear to them that the vaccine is the ticket back to pre-pandemic life.
[02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:24.680]  And the window to do that is really narrowing.
[02:28:24.819 --> 02:28:27.659]  I mean, you were mentioning, Chris, about how all these states are reopening.
[02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:29.520]  They're reopening at 100%.
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:35.180]  And we have a very narrow window to tie reopening policy to vaccination status.
[02:28:35.399 --> 02:28:39.260]  Because otherwise, if everything is reopened, then what's the carrot going to be?
[02:28:39.479 --> 02:28:42.219]  How are we going to incentivize people to actually get the vaccine?
[02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:46.600]  And what we really need to do at this point is to make vaccination the easy choice.
[02:28:46.819 --> 02:28:49.979]  It needs to be hard for people to remain unvaccinated.
[02:28:50.180 --> 02:28:51.520]  Right now, it's kind of the opposite.
[02:28:51.719 --> 02:28:52.180]  It's fine.
[02:28:52.299 --> 02:28:53.860]  I mean, it's easy if you're unvaccinated.
[02:28:53.959 --> 02:28:55.479]  You can do everything you want to do anyway.
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:01.760]  But at some point, these mandates by workplaces, by schools, I think it will be important to say, hey, you can opt out.
[02:29:01.879 --> 02:29:04.360]  But if you want to opt out, you have to sign these forms.
[02:29:04.399 --> 02:29:05.979]  You have to get twice weekly testing.
[02:29:06.340 --> 02:29:09.020]  Basically, we need to make getting vaccinated the easy choice.
[02:29:09.180 --> 02:29:11.920]  That is what it's going to take for us to actually end the pandemic.
[02:29:12.299 --> 02:29:25.059]  If we can tell those individuals who otherwise would not get vaccinated, if we say to them, the moment of freedom for you is when you get vaccinated, when you reach the two-week mark, these are people who otherwise might not be vaccinated.
[02:29:25.059 --> 02:29:26.600]  So let's give them that incentive.
[02:29:26.940 --> 02:29:37.559]  I wonder what's a better strategy, playing to someone's fear using that kind of marketing campaign we just showed, or making the vaccine a requirement for more things like traveling?
[02:29:37.559 --> 02:29:39.159]  Should the U.S. be more like Canada?
[02:29:41.329 --> 02:29:42.190]  Yes, we should.
[02:29:42.370 --> 02:29:45.389]  We really need every tool at our disposal at this point.
[02:29:45.549 --> 02:29:47.209]  We've already tried incentives.
[02:29:47.209 --> 02:29:49.329]  We tried outreach and education.
[02:29:49.530 --> 02:29:51.209]  We should continue doing that.
[02:29:51.389 --> 02:29:54.629]  But at this point, vaccine requirements are the way to go.
[02:29:54.790 --> 02:30:04.809]  But also, especially with holidays coming, it will be a powerful incentive for people to say, look, you can stay unvaccinated if you want, but you're not going to be able to travel to see your family.
[02:30:07.739 --> 02:30:13.579]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:30:17.420 --> 02:30:18.799]  Unbelievable corruption.
[02:30:19.620 --> 02:30:28.399]  You know, I was shocked when I was watching that because I don't know if you've ever seen a hostage video or a prisoner of war video.
[02:30:28.799 --> 02:30:35.239]  You might remember Otto Wambier, who was arrested in North Korea for allegedly stealing a picture off of a wall in his hotel.
[02:30:36.950 --> 02:30:44.090]  Unfortunately died because of the human rights violations against him in a work camp in Korea.
[02:30:45.809 --> 02:30:54.430]  But that's very CCP. It's very communist to have people memorize all of these lines and responses.
[02:30:54.649 --> 02:31:07.959]  So whether you watch Otto Ambir's confession or you watch members of North Korea, citizens of North Korea, when they're approached by a camera crew for a documentary, They always have a pre-scripted response.
[02:31:08.780 --> 02:31:13.059]  So our media, yes, they have pre-scripted responses, but they read from a teleprompter.
[02:31:13.139 --> 02:31:13.959]  It's very transparent.
[02:31:13.959 --> 02:31:15.899]  It's very obvious that everything they say is prepared.
[02:31:16.299 --> 02:31:18.420]  Everything's cut up into perfect time segments.
[02:31:20.600 --> 02:31:24.180]  But the CCP, they just memorize these talking points.
[02:31:24.260 --> 02:31:25.500]  I mean, how obvious was it?
[02:31:25.799 --> 02:31:30.799]  Listening to her speak in all of those clips, and she was wearing the same outfit, most of them, probably focus grouped.
[02:31:31.670 --> 02:31:32.370]  Wear some pink.
[02:31:32.469 --> 02:31:34.889]  It'll make you look feminine and less threatening.
[02:31:35.370 --> 02:31:41.290]  She obviously has all of her talking points and lines memorized perfectly.
[02:31:42.069 --> 02:31:43.889]  Nobody talks like that naturally.
[02:31:44.049 --> 02:31:47.729]  This is somebody who prepared, memorized their talking points, and gave them.
[02:31:47.829 --> 02:31:49.969]  Now, did she make the talking points, or was she given a directive?
[02:31:50.690 --> 02:31:52.489]  She clearly had a political agenda.
[02:31:52.489 --> 02:31:57.510]  It seems to me that this was all just scripted brainwashing.
[02:31:58.200 --> 02:31:59.739]  And look, there's more in the script.
[02:32:00.079 --> 02:32:04.920]  Genetic sequences of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses identified in person in Louisiana.
[02:32:05.219 --> 02:32:07.979]  Bird flu samples from very ill patients had concerning mutations.
[02:32:08.260 --> 02:32:13.799]  Leaked docs exposed Fauci's plan to spray self-spreading vaccines on population centers by drone.
[02:32:14.479 --> 02:32:18.879]  CDC reports potentially troublesome mutations in bird flu found in Louisiana patients.
[02:32:19.739 --> 02:32:24.520]  How America lost control of the bird flu setting the stage for another pandemic.
[02:32:27.950 --> 02:32:29.629]  The last one was really bad, guys.
[02:32:29.870 --> 02:32:31.790]  It's gonna happen again if we're not careful.
[02:32:32.370 --> 02:32:35.309]  Yeah, the last one was bad because you made it up and you tricked everybody.
[02:32:36.489 --> 02:32:38.090]  I'm telling you, these people need to go to prison.
[02:32:38.290 --> 02:32:40.090]  The Wens, the Fauci's.
[02:32:41.999 --> 02:32:49.700]  Pharmaceutical executives who lied, everyone who covered for them, members of our government, bureaucrats, elected officials, they all need to be prosecuted for lying.
[02:32:50.020 --> 02:32:53.280]  The least we could do is prosecute Fauci for lying to Congress.
[02:32:53.979 --> 02:32:54.760]  It's proven.
[02:32:54.760 --> 02:32:57.020]  I don't understand why there is no accountability.
[02:32:57.020 --> 02:33:05.459]  I guess the only cure to this deep state apparatus, which is attempting to take over all of humanity, is to awaken as many people as possible.
[02:33:05.639 --> 02:33:08.420]  Because it seems like it only works if people fall for it, if people believe it.
[02:33:09.129 --> 02:33:21.170]  The con only works if you buy in, if you're tricked by the con artist, and the government is the most successful, competent, innovative, powerful, well-funded, sophisticated con artist in the history of con artists.
[02:33:21.649 --> 02:33:26.729]  You thought Frank Abagnale was impressive, and catch me if you can, just wait till you see what the deep state can do to an entire population.
[02:33:30.420 --> 02:33:46.219]  They forge blank checks every single day and manufacture crises after crises and get us into war after war and murder hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people with all their conflicts, which are totally orchestrated, manufactured, and they get away with it all while we happily sit around and watch football games,
[02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:53.780]  watch Netflix, entertain ourselves, and just ignore it because ignorance is bliss.
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:56.819]  I want to run clip number two.
[02:33:57.659 --> 02:33:58.659]  67 here.
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.340]  This is RFK speaking more on Gates.
[02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:12.600]  Let's run 67. And the last one of these was in 2020 or 2019 October.
[02:34:13.620 --> 02:34:19.579]  And it was hosted by Bill Gates, by Fauci, and by April Hayes.
[02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:24.200]  And interestingly, by George Kayo.
[02:34:24.909 --> 02:34:47.489]  Who is the head of the Chinese CDC? In New York City, and any of you, I'm sure a lot of you have gone and looked at this on the YouTube, it's called Event 201. And the fourth simulation that day, the last one, is all about how you use the pandemic as a pretext for climbing down to a bridge,
[02:34:47.770 --> 02:34:56.989]  as a freedom of speech, and particularly, how do you stop people I'm talking about a lab leak as a source of these virus.
[02:34:57.469 --> 02:35:08.709]  Now this in October 2019, nobody at us at that time never heard of COVID. We now know that COVID is almost certainly circulating by mid-September.
[02:35:08.930 --> 02:35:31.739]  On September 12th, the Chinese government kicked down the door of the Wuhan lab, brought the general way to the biorepids expert from the People's Army, To run the lab and remove all the data function studies from their public case and websites and all the genomic sequences from all the viruses.
[02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:38.500]  The Chinese government clearly knew that the virus was circulating together, so a month later you have this.
[02:35:38.739 --> 02:35:50.819]  That same week, Bill Gates, who was overseeing this simulation, made a argument that was quite fondly shared as a BioNTech vaccine.
[02:35:51.850 --> 02:35:53.729]  Which later became the Pfizer vaccine.
[02:35:54.430 --> 02:35:58.989]  He then sold that, almost sold that stock, 87%.
[02:35:58.989 --> 02:36:05.010]  Two years later, at a $242 million profit.
[02:36:06.049 --> 02:36:10.250]  And a week after that, he publicly announced the vaccine didn't work.
[02:36:26.130 --> 02:36:27.530]  Unbelievable.
[02:36:37.290 --> 02:36:38.690]  Unbelievable.
[02:36:40.690 --> 02:36:52.290]  And we've known the entire time, how many of you were censored or banned or suspended on social media for sharing the claim that the coronavirus was manufactured in a Wuhan lab?
[02:36:52.430 --> 02:36:59.489]  How many of you were criticized or called racist for saying that the virus was manufactured by the Chinese in a Chinese lab?
[02:37:00.549 --> 02:37:02.350]  And we have all of the data.
[02:37:02.770 --> 02:37:05.750]  We know what happened in September 2019 at the lab.
[02:37:05.889 --> 02:37:09.799]  We know What information they deleted from their websites.
[02:37:09.799 --> 02:37:16.479]  We know that they were putting up contracting bids at the Wuhan lab for new ventilation systems at that time.
[02:37:17.799 --> 02:37:27.340]  We know that the Chinese stopped domestic flights in and out of Wuhan, but allowed all international flights to continue.
[02:37:27.799 --> 02:37:36.260]  So they spread it intentionally and didn't admit or confess that there was something spreading all over the world for months and months because they wanted the entire world to be infected.
[02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:49.860]  And the likes of Bill Gates, who I'm sure has a very healthy relationship with China, given the fact that he was the CEO of Microsoft, which did a lot of business with China in the 80s and the 90s, personal computing, chip manufacturing, storage, hardware, all that stuff.
[02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:56.780]  You develop a relationship, you create billions of dollars in revenue for your company and the Chinese over the course of several decades.
[02:37:57.659 --> 02:37:58.840]  They're going to tip you off.
[02:37:58.940 --> 02:38:00.760]  Hey, this thing's happening.
[02:38:01.659 --> 02:38:06.299]  So he buys all of this stock and what would become the Pfizer vaccine, and he sells it.
[02:38:07.319 --> 02:38:11.760]  For $242 million in profit a week before announcing that it didn't work.
[02:38:12.879 --> 02:38:26.920]  It's just like what Paul and Nancy Pelosi did with UnitedHealth, where they invested after the cyber attack on UnitedHealth, they invested in the cybersecurity firm that was contracted to respond to the cyber attack.
[02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:47.930]  Of course, just weeks before the CEO of UnitedHealth was supposed to testify to the DOJ on an insider trading case, He was killed, assassinated by Luigi Mangione, whose grandfather knew Nancy Pelosi's oldest brother very well,
[02:38:48.270 --> 02:38:51.030]  knew Nancy Pelosi's father very well, connected.
[02:38:54.270 --> 02:39:01.030]  This level of corruption cannot stand, and it's not just the Bill Gates's, it's not just the George Soros's, it's the entire political establishment.
[02:39:01.270 --> 02:39:05.290]  From small to large, they are all culpable for these crimes against humanity.
[02:39:05.450 --> 02:39:08.549]  Let's watch clip number 72 on the evil of Fauci.
[02:39:12.190 --> 02:39:23.270]  The reason I ran in 2022 for a third term, even though I said I was going to do two, I'd be happy to go home, trust me, was because nobody else was advocating for the vaccine injured.
[02:39:24.110 --> 02:39:31.270]  And I knew if I won and we gained the majority, I would become chairman of the permanent subcommittee on investigations.
[02:39:32.329 --> 02:39:39.010]  I was chairman of the full committee, but I didn't have as strong a subpoena power as I will have as chairman of the permanent subcommittee investigations.
[02:39:39.899 --> 02:39:44.639]  As the ranking member, I've written over 60 oversight letters to the federal agencies.
[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:46.559]  They've just basically given me their middle finger.
[02:39:46.860 --> 02:40:10.219]  So no, I am absolutely committed We're good to go.
[02:40:10.239 --> 02:40:16.280]  My guess is the shredders, the disk drive erasers are working overdrive.
[02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:19.319]  But in today's world, it's hard to erase records.
[02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:26.680]  I mean, my staff found the famous emails with Damon Rands talking about, you know, I've got this gal who knows how to avoid FOIA requests.
[02:40:26.940 --> 02:40:29.819]  You know, not from the federal health agencies.
[02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:31.440]  One of the people...
[02:40:32.270 --> 02:40:35.790]  On that email chain that did provide us the records.
[02:40:36.250 --> 02:40:44.090]  So it's very dangerous for these individuals when they have, you know, we've sent out letters of, you know, preserve your records, your demands.
[02:40:45.149 --> 02:40:52.809]  If those emails aren't around and we've got them from other sources, and again, I'm putting you on notice, we have emails from other sources.
[02:40:54.389 --> 02:40:57.430]  So you better not destroy records, because that's a criminal act.
[02:40:57.549 --> 02:41:00.549]  And that kind of stuff would be punished.
[02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:03.309]  Do I think Anthony Fauci is a particularly evil man?
[02:41:03.309 --> 02:41:05.549]  I do, because I've read Bobby's books.
[02:41:06.030 --> 02:41:08.629]  Do I think he deserves jail time?
[02:41:08.750 --> 02:41:09.010]  Yeah.
[02:41:09.389 --> 02:41:10.750]  Is that my primary goal?
[02:41:10.829 --> 02:41:13.530]  No, my primary goal is exposure and accountability.
[02:41:14.270 --> 02:41:20.549]  Let's destroy whatever reputation he has, because he should have nothing but an awful reputation.
[02:41:21.170 --> 02:41:23.409]  And so to me, it's always been the same cases.
[02:41:23.989 --> 02:41:28.770]  In politics, exposure and accountability is the first.
[02:41:30.739 --> 02:41:31.219]  Punishment.
[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:33.059]  And probably the most important.
[02:41:34.100 --> 02:41:42.459]  Because it deters other people from, that's the whole purpose of punishing, from my standpoint, is deter others from doing the same type of thing.
[02:41:43.219 --> 02:41:51.239]  I mean, there's certainly a role for actual punishment, or else, I mean, like jail time, because that's a real deterrent as well.
[02:41:51.690 --> 02:41:53.409]  You know, Anthony Fauci was 80 some years.
[02:41:53.530 --> 02:41:56.489]  I don't care to see him in jail, but I want him fully exposed.
[02:41:56.989 --> 02:42:12.680]  Yeah, I wholeheartedly agree, and I would point out that the destruction of a man's reputation, especially somebody who has lived on that reputation, A punishment, and it's an organic one.
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:15.559]  There's a reason that human beings are sensitive to this.
[02:42:15.639 --> 02:42:28.579]  It's because it matters, and in some sense, you know, having to do something like create a prism to disincentivize is really the consequence of a large, anonymous society in which many people don't really even have a reputation.
[02:42:30.470 --> 02:42:33.950]  Reputation or not, there's every reason to get to the bottom of this.
[02:42:34.010 --> 02:42:34.690]  And I agree with you.
[02:42:34.889 --> 02:42:38.610]  If Anthony Fauci is actually innocent, great, let's figure that out.
[02:42:38.750 --> 02:42:39.549]  Oh, he's not.
[02:42:39.750 --> 02:42:41.770]  He sure doesn't look that way.
[02:42:41.989 --> 02:42:46.510]  I mean, look what he did in AIDS. I mean, he withheld Bactrim.
[02:42:46.690 --> 02:42:48.389]  He just wouldn't say, yeah, use it.
[02:42:48.809 --> 02:42:49.809]  Again, same thing.
[02:42:50.010 --> 02:42:51.049]  He wanted a vaccine.
[02:42:51.610 --> 02:42:54.510]  So don't allow a treatment that they knew worked.
[02:42:54.690 --> 02:42:57.069]  So I don't know how many AIDS patients died...
[02:42:57.809 --> 02:42:59.629]  When there was something that actually worked.
[02:43:00.409 --> 02:43:02.229]  So again, he just repeated it.
[02:43:02.370 --> 02:43:03.090]  I agree with you.
[02:43:03.190 --> 02:43:16.670]  And this was one of the mind-blowing things about Bobby Kennedy's, not his most recent book, the Wuhan cover-up, but the one before, the real Anthony Fauci, is the discovery of the fact that actually COVID was a rerun.
[02:43:16.809 --> 02:43:22.850]  Many of us were learning this in real time, but the fact is he'd been through it once, and it's shocking the parallels.
[02:43:23.030 --> 02:43:25.129]  And he escaped accountability for it, too.
[02:43:25.569 --> 02:43:31.329]  I mean, there was at one point the AIDS community was outraged at the guy and I don't know how he repaired that damage.
[02:43:31.510 --> 02:43:31.750]  Yeah.
[02:43:32.370 --> 02:43:34.590]  My guess is through grants, right?
[02:43:34.729 --> 02:43:34.870]  Right.
[02:43:35.049 --> 02:43:39.569]  I got billions of dollars and I'll repair that damage by doling out grant money.
[02:43:39.690 --> 02:43:41.670]  Yeah, he's a master of gaming the system.
[02:43:43.260 --> 02:43:43.819]  Alright, folks.
[02:43:44.020 --> 02:43:45.920]  I'm going to take your calls the next hour.
[02:43:46.459 --> 02:43:47.899]  Starting at 6 after a moment.
[02:43:48.020 --> 02:43:48.979]  I'm going to give out the line now.
[02:43:49.340 --> 02:43:51.520]  I'm calling to talk about any topic that you want.
[02:43:51.819 --> 02:43:54.299]  It's 877-789-2539.
[02:43:54.500 --> 02:43:56.739]  The sooner you call, the more likely I am to get to you.
[02:43:57.059 --> 02:44:00.899]  Again, that's 877-789-2539.
[02:44:01.559 --> 02:44:06.260]  Finally, 877-789-2539.
[02:44:07.250 --> 02:44:09.350]  We're gonna go to break in about three minutes.
[02:44:09.610 --> 02:44:12.670]  I've got a report that I'm gonna run for the first five minutes of the next hour.
[02:44:12.850 --> 02:44:16.729]  And at six after, I will take your calls for the final hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:17.170 --> 02:44:29.190]  Today, before the war room begins, hosted by the one and only, the great, the indelible, Maria Z. So, I think we pretty much nailed it.
[02:44:29.309 --> 02:44:32.149]  We pretty much nailed it that this flu is not really a threat.
[02:44:34.069 --> 02:44:47.290]  We've exposed the fact that the reason it's so transmissible among different flocks or groups of livestock is because of the gain-of-function research that was done on it to make it so it could infect mallard ducks.
[02:44:48.969 --> 02:44:53.270]  And we've hammered home that the reasons this is being done are multifaceted.
[02:44:53.709 --> 02:45:04.629]  Frankly, they want to make a ton of money off of mRNA vaccines for the bird flu, even though humans don't get it from other humans, only from messing with infected poultry.
[02:45:06.190 --> 02:45:07.430]  They want to make money again.
[02:45:07.569 --> 02:45:09.190]  They want to do lockdowns again.
[02:45:09.270 --> 02:45:10.750]  They want to do mask mandates again.
[02:45:10.829 --> 02:45:12.709]  They want to do social distancing again.
[02:45:12.909 --> 02:45:14.670]  They want to shut down the economy again.
[02:45:14.829 --> 02:45:16.110]  They want to do anything they can.
[02:45:17.770 --> 02:45:24.290]  To interfere with Donald Trump's ability to be successful or supported or popular over the course of the next four years.
[02:45:24.989 --> 02:45:29.670]  And they're trying to do as much of it as they can before the inauguration on January 20th.
[02:45:29.750 --> 02:45:42.870]  Because they want to set him up for failure, but they know that he's not going to play ball this time because he got so tricked last time, fooled, coerced, bamboozled last time, manipulated, deceived, just like the American people.
[02:45:44.270 --> 02:46:00.149]  Now, the only way this is going to work, the only way that they're going to be successful in shutting down the economy, in force inoculating swaths of our population with another experimental drug, in hijacking our entire agriculture industry,
[02:46:00.430 --> 02:46:05.069]  is if we aren't aware of it, if we don't fight back, if we don't share this broadcast.
[02:46:06.629 --> 02:46:07.909]  And I plug the store all the time.
[02:46:08.049 --> 02:46:09.170]  I plug the alexjonesstore.com.
[02:46:09.290 --> 02:46:17.389]  You should absolutely go there and get the products, whether they're shirts, they're awesome, or supplements, they're incredibly healthy, or other items that we sell, they're all great, the alexjonesstore.com.
[02:46:17.569 --> 02:46:18.809]  Please go, get something.
[02:46:19.350 --> 02:46:21.290]  It keeps us on the air, and you're gonna love the products.
[02:46:21.389 --> 02:46:23.469]  I'd get them even if it wasn't supporting Alex Jones.
[02:46:23.590 --> 02:46:24.389]  That's how good the products are.
[02:46:25.389 --> 02:46:35.280]  But the best thing you can do, other than pray for us, The best thing you can do is share this broadcast, share these clips, go to band.video, download the clips, re-upload them.
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:48.860]  Please share this live stream, share this broadcast, make sure everyone is awakened to the fact, is alerted to the fact that they're attempting a second pandemic and it's even more of a lie than the first one.
[02:46:48.940 --> 02:46:50.620]  The first one was the lie of lies.
[02:46:53.790 --> 02:46:55.270]  After this break, we're going to be taking your calls.
[02:46:55.389 --> 02:46:57.889]  Make sure you call 877-789-2539.
[02:46:58.850 --> 02:47:05.770]  And in the meantime, open up a tab, go to thealexjonesstore.com and be the reason Alex Jones will always be on the air.
[02:47:06.329 --> 02:47:11.709]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting to stop World War III. We are battling to get Trump into office.
[02:47:11.870 --> 02:47:13.170]  He's only president-elect right now.
[02:47:13.329 --> 02:47:15.049]  We are exposing the globalists.
[02:47:15.149 --> 02:47:18.110]  We are reaching 60, 70, 80 million people a day.
[02:47:18.229 --> 02:47:19.909]  We're back in the Infowar studios.
[02:47:20.370 --> 02:47:22.309]  The purchase was fraudulent.
[02:47:22.709 --> 02:47:24.829]  There's emergency hearings in court coming up next week.
[02:47:25.170 --> 02:47:30.690]  But regardless, I'm gonna stay on air at the Alex Jones Network even if this shuts down.
[02:47:30.870 --> 02:47:36.129]  So when you go to our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, that's not owned by me.
[02:47:36.370 --> 02:47:44.809]  The Onion people and the National Gun Control Crew and the Democrats, even if they succeed, which I don't believe they will, will not get thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:47:44.809 --> 02:47:48.209]  They will not get the Alex Jones Network because I don't own it.
[02:47:48.670 --> 02:47:53.790]  So when you support our sponsor, the AlexJonesStore.com, with some of the most incredible supplements ever.
[02:47:53.989 --> 02:47:56.409]  The Superfood, Irish Sea Moss.
[02:47:56.590 --> 02:47:59.850]  We have the strongest, most concentrated, incredible for your whole body.
[02:48:00.010 --> 02:48:01.370]  Take an hour to go through it all.
[02:48:01.489 --> 02:48:02.329]  Go check it out.
[02:48:02.629 --> 02:48:09.250]  That's there discounted up to 55% when you get three bottles, 50% when you get one bottle, 40% when you get one bottle.
[02:48:09.409 --> 02:48:09.989]  Try it.
[02:48:10.010 --> 02:48:10.629]  You're going to love it.
[02:48:10.690 --> 02:48:11.149]  I'm on it.
[02:48:11.250 --> 02:48:12.030]  I've lost so much weight.
[02:48:12.290 --> 02:48:12.989]  It's insane.
[02:48:13.129 --> 02:48:14.690]  Get that and other supplements, and then...
[02:48:15.129 --> 02:48:18.790]  There's over 200 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies now there.
[02:48:18.989 --> 02:48:25.309]  These folks that own it bigly were already one of the top producers of Trump and Patriot gear.
[02:48:25.430 --> 02:48:26.270]  They had the best designs.
[02:48:26.670 --> 02:48:28.389]  All of the new Trump One gear.
[02:48:28.409 --> 02:48:30.870]  There's more than 40 shirts and hoodies and ball caps there.
[02:48:31.250 --> 02:48:32.530]  These designs are incredible.
[02:48:32.709 --> 02:48:38.930]  And now there's all these amazing Alex Jones shirts that are limited edition and will keep me on the air one way or another.
[02:48:39.090 --> 02:48:39.690]  Here they are.
[02:48:39.870 --> 02:48:40.629]  Look at this one.
[02:48:40.790 --> 02:48:44.709]  That famous meme of me coming out of the tunnel with all the Alex Jones clones.
[02:48:44.969 --> 02:48:46.729]  We are all Alex Jones.
[02:48:46.909 --> 02:48:47.909]  You've got to get that.
[02:48:48.530 --> 02:48:50.229]  Gay frogs equals extinction.
[02:48:50.530 --> 02:48:51.170]  Oh my goodness.
[02:48:51.629 --> 02:48:54.790]  What a way to wake folks up about all the poison in the water that's now mainstream news.
[02:48:55.309 --> 02:48:58.170]  1984 is not an instruction manual.
[02:48:58.649 --> 02:48:59.790]  Team Humanity.
[02:49:00.049 --> 02:49:01.469]  Oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[02:49:01.590 --> 02:49:03.809]  Launched that over a year ago with Elon Musk.
[02:49:04.010 --> 02:49:05.729]  And then, Dale Grebel.
[02:49:06.159 --> 02:49:11.360]  Oh, warns you about the government was right the whole time.
[02:49:11.780 --> 02:49:12.700]  Darkest Hour.
[02:49:12.979 --> 02:49:14.180]  Me is Winston Churchill.
[02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:19.299]  And so much more at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:21.459]  Now, we don't make a ton off the t-shirts.
[02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:26.799]  We don't make a ton off the supplements because there's not a lot of markup in those, but we do sell a lot.
[02:49:26.940 --> 02:49:39.420]  But where we do get major funds is the marked up classic Alex Jones Infowars red on navy blue shirt and a few other fundraiser shirts that aren't 25 or 30 bucks, they're 50, so we get real money in.
[02:49:39.479 --> 02:49:43.239]  Because these t-shirts are high quality, printed right here in Arkansas in the United States.
[02:49:43.819 --> 02:49:47.139]  And so, extra, extra, extra large is like 16, 17 bucks.
[02:49:47.299 --> 02:49:49.579]  A small is like 15. The printing costs money.
[02:49:49.739 --> 02:49:51.000]  The sponsor gets part of the money.
[02:49:51.100 --> 02:49:52.340]  We get part of it to operate.
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.520]  We're making like six, seven bucks on the average t-shirt, which is great.
[02:49:55.659 --> 02:49:56.500]  And they spread the word.
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:49:57.260]  You meet like-minded people.
[02:49:57.379 --> 02:50:03.659]  But when you get the marked up shirts, only two of them are marked up to 50, we get some real money in to the operation.
[02:50:03.739 --> 02:50:06.920]  So if you really want to support, get the fundraiser shirts.
[02:50:07.299 --> 02:50:17.909]  Also, The posters, limited edition, back-to-back-to-back Trump win, all those are marked up where they cost us six, seven bucks to print them and to put it in the tube.
[02:50:18.069 --> 02:50:20.530]  So we make like 40-something bucks off that.
[02:50:20.549 --> 02:50:30.829]  If you really want to support us and hang it on the wall and know you supported the Second American Revolution right at the critical point, then get some of the limited edition posters as well.
[02:50:31.069 --> 02:50:32.790]  Regardless, you're going to love the supplements.
[02:50:33.069 --> 02:50:34.229]  You're going to want to order again.
[02:50:34.549 --> 02:50:36.670]  We can't stay on air without your support.
[02:50:36.909 --> 02:50:38.110]  I'm suing the deep state.
[02:50:38.270 --> 02:50:39.069]  We're going after them.
[02:50:39.170 --> 02:50:45.190]  We have put all the stuff they did and the bid rigging and everything in these lawsuits and court filings.
[02:50:45.510 --> 02:50:46.670]  We're going to win this thing.
[02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:50.409]  But regardless, we've got to have money to continue to fight them and stay on air.
[02:50:50.549 --> 02:51:00.030]  So go now to thealexjonesstore.com for amazing products and know you stood with fellow Americans at the critical time to save our republic.
[02:51:00.290 --> 02:51:03.989]  The AlexJonesStore.com Thank you so much for your support.
[02:51:05.940 --> 02:51:09.420]  Oh my god, this is all a bought and paid for system to promote profit.
[02:51:10.040 --> 02:51:19.020]  Yeah, I think Jamal talked a little bit about this, but I think it's so important, because nobody realizes this, is I think a lot of people listening to us years ago, it's just like, this sounds conspiratorial.
[02:51:19.219 --> 02:51:20.799]  And it's just like, what actually happened?
[02:51:20.899 --> 02:51:26.180]  And there's a couple really important dates that happened, that are historical, that I think set this structure really intentionally.
[02:51:26.559 --> 02:51:28.479]  The first was 1909, the Flexner Report.
[02:51:28.760 --> 02:51:35.319]  So literally, John D. Rockefeller's personal lawyer wrote the report for Congress that basically set the standard today for medical education.
[02:51:35.700 --> 02:51:41.739]  It literally says in the binding guidelines that holistic health and nutrition and anything about interconnectedness to the body is pseudoscience.
[02:51:41.920 --> 02:51:44.319]  It says we need to name the condition and cut it out or prescribe it.
[02:51:44.340 --> 02:51:44.959]  And what year is this?
[02:51:45.139 --> 02:51:50.760]  1909. So they're still going by the recommendations of 1909. We still follow the Flexer Report.
[02:51:52.050 --> 02:51:53.190]  That is so crazy.
[02:51:53.709 --> 02:52:11.049]  But like rescinding the Flexner Report and having updated scientific education and standard of care guidelines based on what we've learned since 1909 about the majesty of the interconnectedness of our body is a really good first start because we're binded under a law Just demonstrably, just like, again, not conspiratorial, John D. Rockefeller's personal lawyer wrote this report.
[02:52:11.190 --> 02:52:11.350]  Why?
[02:52:11.549 --> 02:52:24.629]  Because John D. Rockefeller is the father of the pharmaceutical industry and created pharmaceuticals from byproducts of oil production and was the first investor into Johns Hopkins and other major medical schools, University of Chicago, and started the modern education program for health.
[02:52:24.790 --> 02:52:37.309]  There were some big issues in the health of the Wild West, but he created Johns Hopkins and the standard of residency training as a way to silo diseases very intentionally and then prescribe his products and interventions as the top pharmaceutical maker.
[02:52:37.709 --> 02:52:41.190]  And the medical schools that he created were basically a distribution system to him.
[02:52:41.270 --> 02:52:51.959]  Okay, so you get to World War II. Up until World War II, around that time, the 1950s, 1960s, I would argue almost any medical miracle you can think of or any listener can think of was created before that time.
[02:52:52.299 --> 02:52:58.159]  You know, it's all acute situations, emergency surgical procedures, sanitation procedures, antibiotics to make an infection not deadly.
[02:52:58.479 --> 02:53:08.200]  Almost every medical miracle we can think of was something that was going to kill you right away, infectious disease, and then you take the pill or take the treatment for a finite period of time and you stop it, or do the surgery quickly and you're cured.
[02:53:08.890 --> 02:53:10.010]  Those are medical miracles.
[02:53:10.129 --> 02:53:17.889]  And we had a lot of good things happen up until World War II. Very intentionally, the medical industry saw the birth control pill in the late 1950s, 1960s.
[02:53:18.010 --> 02:53:21.649]  And the birth control pill was the first pill in world history that people took for longer than a couple weeks.
[02:53:21.850 --> 02:53:24.090]  It was the first pill ever that is like, oh, interesting.
[02:53:24.229 --> 02:53:27.329]  You can actually convince someone to take a pill for years, for almost most of their life.
[02:53:27.729 --> 02:53:28.430]  Recurring revenue.
[02:53:28.610 --> 02:53:33.930]  And there was a huge emphasis of the medical industry to take the trust engendered up until 1960. RFK talks about this.
[02:53:34.350 --> 02:53:35.709]  We didn't spend money on chronic disease management.
[02:53:35.889 --> 02:53:37.069]  All medicine was with acute issues.
[02:53:37.190 --> 02:53:40.489]  Chronic disease, diabetes, obesity, that was outside the doctor's office.
[02:53:40.770 --> 02:53:43.329]  They saw that you could medicalize chronic conditions.
[02:53:43.649 --> 02:53:46.329]  Today, 95% of spending is on chronic conditions.
[02:53:46.510 --> 02:53:47.229]  So what do we do?
[02:53:47.309 --> 02:53:55.450]  In the 1970s, literally the Sackler family, their grandkids and kids did the opioids, their forebearers created Valium.
[02:53:56.030 --> 02:53:58.870]  And 30% of women in the United States in the 1970s were on Valium.
[02:53:58.930 --> 02:54:00.629]  Time Magazine, Valium Nation, Mommy's Little Helper.
[02:54:00.850 --> 02:54:03.129]  So we started creating all these psychiatric conditions.
[02:54:03.129 --> 02:54:04.670]  We started medicalizing heart disease.
[02:54:04.809 --> 02:54:06.510]  We started medicalizing all these type 2 diabetes.
[02:54:06.750 --> 02:54:15.649]  Started creating academic research totally funded by the pharmaceutical industry saying that type 2 diabetes isn't reversible, that it's basically genetic, heart disease, all these things, and started pilling them.
[02:54:16.329 --> 02:54:17.389]  Then what happened to food?
[02:54:17.610 --> 02:54:21.010]  Chronic disease wasn't that big of a deal in the 1970s, 1980s.
[02:54:21.450 --> 02:54:22.510]  You look at the graph.
[02:54:22.510 --> 02:54:24.350]  You look at the graph of all chronic conditions.
[02:54:24.469 --> 02:54:26.370]  There's just a sharp turn in the 1980s.
[02:54:26.530 --> 02:54:31.670]  It's literally almost to the year of the Surgeon General report saying smoking wasn't great.
[02:54:32.069 --> 02:54:36.770]  So the second that report came out, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds were two of the largest companies in the world.
[02:54:36.829 --> 02:54:38.889]  It wasn't like Microsoft and Google on the top companies list.
[02:54:38.930 --> 02:54:39.750]  It was like cigarette companies.
[02:54:39.950 --> 02:54:42.930]  You know, dopamine is a really good thing to sell, which the tech companies do now.
[02:54:43.659 --> 02:54:50.139]  And they used their cash piles, and by 1990, the three largest M&A deals in American history, in world history, were cigarette companies buying food companies.
[02:54:50.360 --> 02:54:58.059]  So you had Nabisco bought by RJ Reynolds, you had Kraft and US Food, and you see those graphs of all the food companies owned by like a couple companies?
[02:54:58.219 --> 02:54:59.120]  That was the cigarette companies.
[02:54:59.239 --> 02:55:01.120]  And they did two things very, very intentionally.
[02:55:01.850 --> 02:55:08.709]  They took over the institutions of trust to say ultra-processed food was healthy, and then they took their scientists and rigged the food itself to make it more addictive.
[02:55:08.829 --> 02:55:10.329]  Not to kill kids, but to make it more addictive.
[02:55:10.610 --> 02:55:15.510]  So you had that literal food pyramid, which said ultra-processed food is great, low-fat, carbs, basic pyramid.
[02:55:15.709 --> 02:55:20.549]  That was constructed literally by the cigarette industry to promote their addictive products.
[02:55:20.889 --> 02:55:24.309]  And this weaponization of food, as I call it, it's not just like this conspiracy.
[02:55:24.610 --> 02:55:29.479]  Literally the cigarette industry Those two companies were the two largest food producers in the United States.
[02:55:29.700 --> 02:55:32.799]  Like 50% of American food were created by cigarette companies in the 1990s.
[02:55:32.979 --> 02:55:37.319]  And they have got us addicted and weaponized this food, and all chronic conditions have just shot up.
[02:55:37.399 --> 02:55:42.899]  It's because that ultra-processed food, literally by tobacco industry scientists, hijacks our evolutionary biology.
[02:55:43.079 --> 02:55:48.729]  Again, you can't overeat grass-fed steak, but these food, with scientists much smarter than any of us, That's what they're doing.
[02:55:49.069 --> 02:55:50.549]  They're shutting off our society signals.
[02:55:50.690 --> 02:55:55.469]  The byproduct of this cheap addictive food, which we don't even have research for yet, is that it's sprayed with all these chemicals.
[02:55:55.629 --> 02:55:59.530]  It's sprayed with 10,000 chemicals that are allowed in the United States when only 400 are allowed in Europe.
[02:55:59.729 --> 02:56:03.229]  All these chemicals to make the food addictive, to make the food cheap, you know, to do the monocropping.
[02:56:03.340 --> 02:56:05.319]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:05.479 --> 02:56:10.280]  I am Chase Geiser, your host for the next 54 minutes before the war room begins at 3 p.m.
[02:56:10.479 --> 02:56:11.879]  Central Time until 6 p.m.
[02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:13.719]  I will be hosting tomorrow as well.
[02:56:13.959 --> 02:56:19.319]  Alex Jones will be back in studio on Thursday after the new year, ready to hit the new year hard.
[02:56:21.319 --> 02:56:23.540]  Unbelievable everything that's unfolding right before our eyes.
[02:56:23.639 --> 02:56:29.280]  We've got the White House coming out with statements bragging about giving $2.5 billion more to Ukraine.
[02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:41.270]  We've got Members of the CDC and the WHO advocating for funding of 5 million vaccines for a flu that doesn't even spread from human to human, all with experimental mRNA technology.
[02:56:41.270 --> 02:56:43.690]  And they're trying to get it all done before January 20th.
[02:56:45.469 --> 02:56:52.469]  We've got the media trying to divide MAGA against itself over H1B visas, which is really a small issue compared to all the other issues that we face.
[02:56:52.610 --> 02:56:55.649]  And we've got Donald Trump coming out and endorsing Speaker Johnson.
[02:56:55.649 --> 02:56:58.090]  I hope it's 4D chess because I can't imagine why.
[02:56:59.030 --> 02:57:01.870]  All while Russia rejects Donald Trump's Ukraine peace plan.
[02:57:02.270 --> 02:57:06.889]  Leaked docs expose Fauci's plan to spray self-spreading vaccines on population centers by drone.
[02:57:07.149 --> 02:57:13.969]  Federal prosecutors involved in Trump witch hunts in January 6th cases are fleeing the DOJ. Democrats are lobbying for Biden to pardon IRS contractors.
[02:57:14.829 --> 02:57:22.510]  And Biden continues to ramble incoherently as his mind slips further and further into the abyss.
[02:57:22.649 --> 02:57:23.709]  Let's go to Ryan in Arizona.
[02:57:23.950 --> 02:57:24.690]  Ryan, what's on your mind?
[02:57:28.239 --> 02:57:29.100]  Hold on a second, Ryan.
[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:29.979]  We're going to go to the first call.
[02:57:30.139 --> 02:57:31.200]  Ryan in Arizona at the top.
[02:57:31.559 --> 02:57:32.319]  Ryan, go ahead.
[02:57:32.420 --> 02:57:32.979]  I can hear you now.
[02:57:33.819 --> 02:57:34.340]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:57:34.500 --> 02:57:34.860]  Yes, sir.
[02:57:34.920 --> 02:57:35.139]  Sorry about that.
[02:57:35.260 --> 02:57:35.760]  Thank you for calling.
[02:57:35.899 --> 02:57:36.360]  Thank you for having me.
[02:57:36.739 --> 02:57:37.379]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:57:37.760 --> 02:57:38.579]  It's all connected.
[02:57:38.579 --> 02:57:40.219]  I think the drones was a spray.
[02:57:40.440 --> 02:57:41.000]  I don't know.
[02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:42.780]  2.5 billion to Ukraine.
[02:57:43.979 --> 02:57:45.000]  You just said it all.
[02:57:45.180 --> 02:57:46.819]  Fauci, CDC, 5 million vaccines.
[02:57:48.239 --> 02:57:52.319]  They're just doing everything they can before the three weeks they have left.
[02:57:52.340 --> 02:57:53.780]  And it's actually getting dangerous.
[02:57:53.899 --> 02:57:55.479]  I swear there was a spray everywhere.
[02:57:55.620 --> 02:57:57.899]  But the real reason I call you, this...
[02:57:57.989 --> 02:58:01.149]  This H1 thing, how it went everywhere, pisses me off.
[02:58:01.409 --> 02:58:09.790]  And I want to say F Elon, and I don't want to curse, and I know you guys support him and all, and I don't want to get into that, how it separated everyone, but I want to share a story.
[02:58:10.170 --> 02:58:12.530]  My wife hasn't been allowed here in four years.
[02:58:13.409 --> 02:58:14.489]  Four years, Chase.
[02:58:14.790 --> 02:58:22.969]  I have to sit here and watch illegals stealing money, millions of dollars, tens of thousands on a credit card living in a hotel free and voting!
[02:58:23.690 --> 02:58:24.090]  Voting!
[02:58:24.409 --> 02:58:27.819]  And my wife Not only can't vote, she cannot be next to me.
[02:58:27.959 --> 02:58:28.739]  We can't touch.
[02:58:29.100 --> 02:58:30.639]  Four years the legal way.
[02:58:30.799 --> 02:58:31.260]  Two lawyers.
[02:58:31.559 --> 02:58:33.940]  The USCIS denied us a K-3.
[02:58:34.520 --> 02:58:36.059]  That's where she comes here to marry me.
[02:58:36.100 --> 02:58:36.920]  No clue why.
[02:58:37.659 --> 02:58:39.819]  I've asked everyone, and I can't get it out there.
[02:58:39.879 --> 02:58:40.459]  No one will listen.
[02:58:40.559 --> 02:58:42.159]  Everyone's talking about illegals.
[02:58:42.420 --> 02:58:46.139]  No one's talking about legal immigration is not allowed.
[02:58:46.459 --> 02:58:48.219]  We are now working with Mark Kelly.
[02:58:48.540 --> 02:58:50.200]  I tried Eli Crane.
[02:58:50.399 --> 02:58:51.540]  He's my congressman.
[02:58:51.799 --> 02:58:52.059]  Nothing.
[02:58:52.520 --> 02:58:54.799]  Now I'm trying, because love is more important than politics.
[02:58:55.370 --> 02:58:57.309]  So I just want to say I'm really mad at Trump.
[02:58:57.670 --> 02:58:59.149]  He's got Melania as his wife.
[02:58:59.309 --> 02:59:02.270]  I'm an American citizen and he won't help me, but he'll help Elon.
[02:59:02.510 --> 02:59:09.649]  And he's got an immigrant in charge of the world letting other immigrants in as cashiers, servers, Vegas workers.
[02:59:09.889 --> 02:59:11.989]  They're not medical Indian scientists.
[02:59:12.590 --> 02:59:14.450]  So we can stop fighting and just...
[02:59:14.450 --> 02:59:18.309]  I just want to say my wife can't be with me and it's so sad.
[02:59:18.610 --> 02:59:19.170]  One more thing.
[02:59:19.290 --> 02:59:19.629]  I'm sorry.
[02:59:19.909 --> 02:59:20.950]  I'm going blind.
[02:59:21.110 --> 02:59:21.629]  No, it's okay.
[02:59:21.750 --> 02:59:23.450]  I've got a medical reason I'm going blind.
[02:59:23.549 --> 02:59:24.530]  I may never see her.
[02:59:25.200 --> 02:59:26.120]  And they don't care.
[02:59:27.200 --> 02:59:29.659]  Every board member, by the way, makes $200,000.
[02:59:30.059 --> 02:59:31.520]  And they won't look at that.
[02:59:31.879 --> 02:59:35.659]  Vivek Ramsey, look at the USCIS board members, $200,000.
[02:59:36.579 --> 02:59:37.299]  Sorry, Chase.
[02:59:37.680 --> 02:59:38.959]  No, you don't have to apologize.
[02:59:39.260 --> 02:59:40.579]  I understand your frustration.
[02:59:40.579 --> 02:59:42.180]  I haven't gone through anything like that.
[02:59:42.520 --> 02:59:44.459]  But I understand how painful that must be.
[02:59:44.620 --> 02:59:46.920]  And I'm really sorry that you're unable to be with your wife.
[02:59:47.059 --> 02:59:53.020]  And it's incredibly frustrating to see everyone except for American citizens benefit from America.
[02:59:54.350 --> 03:00:04.549]  And the 25 million people who have come in illegally at least, a million of them criminals, hundreds of thousands of them terrorists, and I understand your frustration.
[03:00:05.629 --> 03:00:09.030]  And I know on this network that we've supported Elon Musk.
[03:00:09.290 --> 03:00:10.370]  I certainly have.
[03:00:10.489 --> 03:00:11.569]  I'm not told what to say.
[03:00:11.690 --> 03:00:12.469]  I could be critical of him.
[03:00:12.489 --> 03:00:14.469]  All I wanted is a free speech platform.
[03:00:14.649 --> 03:00:15.790]  Alex is very good about that.
[03:00:17.690 --> 03:00:26.030]  But frankly, the reason that I've been so supportive of him is because I think his support for Trump's Potentially save the country.
[03:00:26.229 --> 03:00:32.229]  I don't know if Trump could have won without him and RFK Jr. And I know that X is not a perfect platform.
[03:00:32.450 --> 03:00:40.129]  I am very disappointed that Elon Musk took away Owen Schroeder's blue check for reasons yet to be determined and others.
[03:00:40.909 --> 03:00:42.110]  I'm disappointed in that.
[03:00:42.729 --> 03:00:48.969]  But he brought Alex Jones back to X and he did liberate X from the shackles it was previously in.
[03:00:49.010 --> 03:00:49.950]  It doesn't mean it's perfect now.
[03:00:50.049 --> 03:00:51.290]  It doesn't mean it's totally free now.
[03:00:51.549 --> 03:00:52.870]  But it's so much closer.
[03:00:54.229 --> 03:01:04.329]  And I understand that people in America are struggling and it's frustrating when we're importing skilled labor into the United States while our own people suffer.
[03:01:06.290 --> 03:01:14.409]  But you have to keep in mind that the number of people working here in the United States on an active H-1B visa is like between 500 and 700,000 people.
[03:01:15.770 --> 03:01:18.610]  You compare that to the 25 million who have come in illegally.
[03:01:21.610 --> 03:01:25.770]  Compare that to the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, who have died in the war in Ukraine.
[03:01:26.969 --> 03:01:30.209]  These conflicts between Israel and Gaza.
[03:01:34.209 --> 03:01:40.190]  And all the deaths from the vaccines and the pandemic response and all the theft and the lies.
[03:01:40.629 --> 03:01:44.409]  I mean, yeah, I think that we should debate the H1B issue.
[03:01:45.770 --> 03:01:55.149]  But if Elon Musk played any part in solving those other major problems that I just highlighted, even if he's wrong about H-1B visas, he's still a net good.
[03:01:56.510 --> 03:02:02.430]  See, one of the things that we struggle with as Americans is because of our Christian upbringing and background.
[03:02:03.549 --> 03:02:05.610]  We idolize our founding fathers.
[03:02:06.469 --> 03:02:07.729]  They seem perfect.
[03:02:08.469 --> 03:02:09.790]  They wrote perfectly.
[03:02:11.250 --> 03:02:14.530]  They accomplished a perfect victory over tyranny.
[03:02:16.829 --> 03:02:20.170]  And as Christians, we obviously idolize the Son of God.
[03:02:21.889 --> 03:02:25.430]  And we expect every leader to be perfect.
[03:02:25.450 --> 03:02:37.190]  And as soon as someone is imperfect or 5% off what we believe or think, our intuition is just to totally write them off.
[03:02:39.270 --> 03:02:41.010]  And I've said this before about Trump.
[03:02:42.229 --> 03:02:45.450]  He's not perfect, but he is excellent.
[03:02:46.370 --> 03:02:47.809]  We don't need a perfect president.
[03:02:48.030 --> 03:02:49.809]  We don't need an American messiah.
[03:02:50.069 --> 03:02:51.489]  We just need an excellent president.
[03:02:52.290 --> 03:02:54.049]  RFK Jr., not perfect.
[03:02:55.069 --> 03:02:57.329]  Even more flawed, I think, than Musk and Trump.
[03:02:57.590 --> 03:02:59.670]  But very good.
[03:03:00.309 --> 03:03:01.950]  Elon Musk, imperfect.
[03:03:02.110 --> 03:03:03.309]  I don't agree with carbon taxes.
[03:03:04.049 --> 03:03:15.760]  I don't like the fact that electric cars are powered by Lithium ion batteries from cobalt mined by children in Africa and other places in the world.
[03:03:15.860 --> 03:03:16.319]  I don't like that.
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:18.600]  It's imperfect.
[03:03:19.659 --> 03:03:26.540]  I don't like the fact that people are still being suspended from time to time on X or losing their verification badges just because they've irritated Elon Musk.
[03:03:26.659 --> 03:03:27.040]  I don't like that.
[03:03:27.159 --> 03:03:28.899]  I disagree with it 100%.
[03:03:28.899 --> 03:03:31.200]  But he's still very good.
[03:03:35.590 --> 03:03:38.010]  So, I don't know, I'm just not one to throw stones.
[03:03:38.149 --> 03:03:50.469]  I'm happy to throw stones at the New World Order at Biden and Soros and Klaus Schwab and others and Fauci's and Bill Gates and these other institutions because their evil, their malice is so far gone.
[03:03:50.469 --> 03:03:56.690]  It's so bad that I can throw stones there because I'm not nearly that bad.
[03:03:57.989 --> 03:04:02.030]  I mean, they're actually net negative 99% negative, 1% good maybe.
[03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:12.180]  But I'm not gonna throw stones at people who are doing a net positive, who are making a positive impact on the planet.
[03:04:12.280 --> 03:04:13.100]  And I'm sorry, man.
[03:04:13.239 --> 03:04:20.360]  I'm so sorry that you can't be with your wife, and you're going blind, and you're seeing all these people come in to the United States, but you can't get your own wife here.
[03:04:20.540 --> 03:04:21.639]  I know it's frustrating.
[03:04:23.899 --> 03:04:32.940]  The fact of the matter is, Elon Musk has established a critical mass of freedom of speech on acts.
[03:04:33.780 --> 03:04:36.200]  That allowed for Trump to get elected and Trump is our only hope.
[03:04:37.079 --> 03:04:38.680]  I don't know if he's gonna pull it off or not.
[03:04:38.799 --> 03:04:41.440]  I don't know if four years is enough time to do it.
[03:04:42.219 --> 03:04:49.799]  But I know without him, our defeat was guaranteed and with him there is some semblance of hope and just a little bit of hope.
[03:04:49.920 --> 03:04:51.920]  A sliver of hope is enough.
[03:04:53.420 --> 03:04:55.719]  I'm not even gonna criticize those who criticize Musk.
[03:04:55.899 --> 03:04:59.879]  I just don't think that you should write off Infowars or Trump.
[03:05:03.010 --> 03:05:09.190]  Or others in the MAGA movement because they support someone that makes a mistake 20% of the time.
[03:05:10.790 --> 03:05:13.909]  But does astronomical good 80% of the time.
[03:05:14.909 --> 03:05:17.629]  We have to have a little bit of grace for those who deserve it.
[03:05:17.950 --> 03:05:19.590]  And maybe I'm totally wrong about Musk.
[03:05:19.709 --> 03:05:27.889]  Maybe Musk is a globalist and he's just hijacking this movement and it'll come out in hindsight it'll be 20-20 that the entire time we should never have trusted.
[03:05:28.010 --> 03:05:28.590]  Maybe that'll happen.
[03:05:28.889 --> 03:05:32.530]  All I know is that Donald Trump would not have been elected without Trump or without Elon Musk.
[03:05:34.549 --> 03:05:37.569]  Liberating freedom of speech on the internet and supporting him locally.
[03:05:38.670 --> 03:05:49.829]  And so he gave us a narrow way, a narrow path forward to victory over the new world order, over globalism.
[03:05:50.850 --> 03:05:53.989]  And it's a rough road and it's rugged and it's imperfect.
[03:05:54.649 --> 03:05:59.629]  And every once in a while he may step on our toes as we walk the path towards the liberation of humanity.
[03:06:01.329 --> 03:06:03.309]  But he's not blocking the way.
[03:06:04.520 --> 03:06:05.239]  Like these others.
[03:06:05.520 --> 03:06:06.940]  Like the world's super villains.
[03:06:08.420 --> 03:06:09.479]  Let's go to John in Ohio.
[03:06:09.680 --> 03:06:10.340]  John, what's on your mind?
[03:06:12.219 --> 03:06:15.879]  Chase, man, you're definitely one of my favorite Infowars people.
[03:06:16.260 --> 03:06:16.579]  Thank you.
[03:06:16.799 --> 03:06:17.620]  I respect you for that.
[03:06:18.899 --> 03:06:24.500]  One thing that you kind of missed on that last rant was that the Founding Fathers weren't perfect either.
[03:06:24.719 --> 03:06:33.600]  I mean, if people only recorded what I wrote down every 10 years, I'd probably seem pretty perfect too, but nobody sees what you go on through your day-to-day life, right?
[03:06:33.659 --> 03:06:34.040]  100%.
[03:06:35.760 --> 03:06:46.440]  Well, the one thing I was going to say, the only reason I were called when we were talking about the vaccine, I know everybody has their doubts, especially with everything that happened with the vaccine.
[03:06:47.840 --> 03:06:55.079]  Do you think it's possible that maybe they actually have a cure for a vaccine for once, right?
[03:06:55.520 --> 03:07:00.280]  And the next one that they try to put on us is going to be the one we should take, right?
[03:07:00.319 --> 03:07:03.090]  Because they already took out all the Opposition.
[03:07:03.389 --> 03:07:05.069]  All the old people anyways.
[03:07:05.770 --> 03:07:10.430]  And now they have all the people who aren't going to take the next vaccine on the edge, right?
[03:07:10.670 --> 03:07:18.930]  So shouldn't we be optimistic to just being like, when we see how this goes, rather than just saying, okay, I'm completely against this, right?
[03:07:19.290 --> 03:07:22.250]  I mean, the government always thinks in two ways, don't they?
[03:07:22.829 --> 03:07:24.709]  Well, it's like the boy who cried wolf, right?
[03:07:25.069 --> 03:07:27.090]  Eventually, there's actually a wolf coming, right?
[03:07:27.709 --> 03:07:33.270]  And so now that they've betrayed our trust with what happened in 2020, we're not inclined to ever trust them again.
[03:07:33.270 --> 03:07:37.270]  And it's possible that down the road there's going to be a very real, very dangerous pandemic.
[03:07:37.489 --> 03:07:41.030]  And they're going to come out and claim that there's a very real and dangerous pandemic.
[03:07:41.030 --> 03:07:44.370]  And because they have lied to us so much, we will not believe them.
[03:07:44.629 --> 03:07:46.209]  And maybe that will be a disaster.
[03:07:46.329 --> 03:07:46.809]  That's possible.
[03:07:47.420 --> 03:08:04.840]  But there are other factors to consider surrounding all of these details because we have enough evidence and information and details to know that this is BS. The first thing is that they discovered this bird flu virus in 1961. So it's been around forever.
[03:08:05.180 --> 03:08:17.739]  It infected the first person in Hong Kong in 1997. It's not transmissible from human to human, only from poultry or cattle to humans.
[03:08:18.959 --> 03:08:34.620]  Now, more people, three times more people, human beings, were found to have had this bird flu between 2010 and 2014 than between 2020 and 2024. But for some reason, now they're hyping it up.
[03:08:36.489 --> 03:08:40.889]  We know that the mortality rate is not really the 50-60% that they're claiming that it is.
[03:08:40.989 --> 03:08:43.670]  Because A, the virus is less lethal than it used to be.
[03:08:43.790 --> 03:08:48.329]  And B, the people who died of it were living in third world countries and sleeping with their chickens.
[03:08:49.129 --> 03:08:50.590]  Did not have access to healthcare.
[03:08:52.750 --> 03:08:55.430]  No one in the United States has died of the bird flu.
[03:08:56.510 --> 03:08:58.829]  So they're lying about the mortality rate.
[03:08:59.889 --> 03:09:02.229]  They're lying about how infectious it is.
[03:09:03.540 --> 03:09:05.540]  We're good to go.
[03:09:16.049 --> 03:09:22.870]  And they already had a vaccine waiting in the wings for it that they want to give to 5 million people even though humans don't get it or transfer it.
[03:09:23.110 --> 03:09:37.750]  And we know that gain-of-function research was done to make sure that this bird flu was transmissible from chickens to mallard ducks so the mallard ducks could transport it all across the continent from flock to flock.
[03:09:39.059 --> 03:09:56.440]  And so, based on the fact that this virus has been around forever, based on the fact that we know it used to be more lethal, based on the fact that more people had it between 2010 and 2014 than between 2020 and 2024, based on the fact that we know that the mRNA vaccine has not gone through all the proper procedures for study,
[03:09:56.540 --> 03:09:56.920]  for safety.
[03:09:57.829 --> 03:10:16.370]  Based on the fact that we know it's the same technology as the vaccines that were used in 2020 that caused myocarditis and severe health issues and vaccine injuries, that's enough evidence for us to know that even though someday our government may be telling us the truth about a very real pandemic that is a very real threat, it's enough evidence for us to know that it's not this time.
[03:10:16.530 --> 03:10:17.489]  Thank you so much for your call, John.
[03:10:17.610 --> 03:10:18.489]  I think that was a really good point.
[03:10:18.610 --> 03:10:19.510]  I'm glad we got to address it.
[03:10:19.590 --> 03:10:20.110]  Danny in Canada.
[03:10:20.229 --> 03:10:20.909]  Danny, what's on your mind?
[03:10:23.149 --> 03:10:23.670]  Hey, yes.
[03:10:23.750 --> 03:10:24.090]  Hello, Chase.
[03:10:24.270 --> 03:10:26.290]  I'm glad to be able to be on here.
[03:10:26.569 --> 03:10:27.090]  Thank you.
[03:10:29.799 --> 03:10:33.879]  Yeah, I've been watching you on and off, though, whenever I can, though, for years.
[03:10:34.020 --> 03:10:45.659]  And it was since 2016, though, when I learned of Trump going for office, though, then I started to question literally, like, everything, though.
[03:10:45.739 --> 03:10:50.040]  Like, you know, when you're growing up, though, you think politics is not going to interfere in your personal life.
[03:10:50.139 --> 03:10:50.299]  Sure.
[03:10:50.379 --> 03:10:54.819]  You have space separated from it, though, but you end up learning now they're invading everything.
[03:10:55.819 --> 03:10:56.520]  And then some.
[03:10:57.299 --> 03:10:57.639]  Absolutely.
[03:11:01.640 --> 03:11:12.000]  So, what I was wanting to try to talk about, but I could also talk about the visas, because that happens up here, too, just like in the U.S., but whatever happens in the U.S. usually happens in Canada and vice versa.
[03:11:12.219 --> 03:11:12.340]  Sure.
[03:11:12.340 --> 03:11:13.819]  They just, you know, try to spin it.
[03:11:15.540 --> 03:11:23.459]  But as far as with, like, families anyway, though, you know, when you have to deal with them and they still want to believe in the propaganda, though, and that's been hard with me, though, because...
[03:11:25.190 --> 03:11:34.889]  I had to argue with my parents for about a year on and off, though, just to have them avoid taking the jab, though, and tell them, just see what happens, see what things that we spout on.
[03:11:35.149 --> 03:11:37.629]  Like, I was lucky, but it was a hard fight.
[03:11:39.149 --> 03:11:42.370]  But, yeah, I know I mentioned I was going to talk about beliefs, though, and this ties in.
[03:11:43.110 --> 03:11:44.770]  I'm going to tie it in right now, though.
[03:11:44.889 --> 03:11:55.030]  It's just that it's frustrating when dealing with people who tend to prefer the belief because they may somehow want to think that somehow maybe it will...
[03:12:09.129 --> 03:12:16.229]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[03:12:16.350 --> 03:12:24.409]  It's incredibly difficult to change someone's mind, especially if they're determined, especially if the truth is more painful than whatever reality they live in.
[03:12:24.829 --> 03:12:26.049]  There's ways to do it.
[03:12:26.250 --> 03:12:30.709]  You can read books like Influence, which is a famous book on persuasion.
[03:12:30.930 --> 03:12:32.450]  You can read books on marketing.
[03:12:32.750 --> 03:12:36.049]  You can read things like 48 Laws of Power.
[03:12:36.290 --> 03:12:38.250]  You can read things like The Art of Seduction.
[03:12:38.809 --> 03:12:43.409]  You can study how to manipulate and persuade people.
[03:12:45.090 --> 03:12:50.250]  But from my experience, the best way...
[03:12:51.690 --> 03:12:55.909]  To convert people is to put them in a position or allow them to come to the truth on their own.
[03:12:55.909 --> 03:13:01.750]  You ever had a boss or somebody that you knew that even if you had a great idea, they would hate it unless it was their own idea?
[03:13:01.950 --> 03:13:03.250]  They only wanted to do their own idea.
[03:13:04.670 --> 03:13:13.409]  Sometimes you have to frame the truth in such a way that they can feel as though they arrived at it on their own without it being forced upon them.
[03:13:14.569 --> 03:13:20.590]  You have to be very delicate with the way that you present this type of knowledge and awakening to people.
[03:13:20.750 --> 03:13:23.209]  If you force it too strong on them, they're just not going to be interested.
[03:13:23.329 --> 03:13:26.090]  It's like you're trying to get a girlfriend or go on a date with somebody.
[03:13:26.690 --> 03:13:28.290]  If you come on too strong, they're not going to be interested.
[03:13:28.430 --> 03:13:31.889]  So you have to have an element of cat-mouse, an element of disinterest.
[03:13:31.889 --> 03:13:33.329]  Two steps forward, one step back.
[03:13:33.430 --> 03:13:34.510]  Two steps forward, one step back.
[03:13:34.629 --> 03:13:36.450]  So just find an issue that's less sensitive.
[03:13:37.110 --> 03:13:38.629]  Tease that one a little bit, and then walk it back.
[03:13:38.930 --> 03:13:41.010]  And then you take it over a long period of time.
[03:13:42.309 --> 03:13:45.049]  Eventually, They arrive at the truth on their own.
[03:13:45.309 --> 03:13:55.510]  But I wish I could give you a better answer or a better solution, because this ultimately is the fundamental problem that we face as a species.
[03:13:56.010 --> 03:14:00.190]  It's a problem that so many people are unaware of the truth.
[03:14:00.389 --> 03:14:03.610]  Millions upon millions, billions upon billions of people are unaware of the truth.
[03:14:03.950 --> 03:14:07.909]  And when presented with the truth, they're unwilling to acknowledge it.
[03:14:09.590 --> 03:14:11.770]  That's the fundamental issue that we face.
[03:14:12.069 --> 03:14:19.750]  And so all we can do is earnestly seek the truth and earnestly speak the truth and let God take care of the rest.
[03:14:19.909 --> 03:14:20.729]  Let's go to Tim in Seattle.
[03:14:20.889 --> 03:14:21.549]  Tim, what's on your mind?
[03:14:24.450 --> 03:14:26.190]  Hey man, thanks for calling.
[03:14:27.270 --> 03:14:32.809]  Well, I appreciate you being on air and giving us a chance to speak for voices out there.
[03:14:34.680 --> 03:14:36.500]  We're going to do scamdemic number two.
[03:14:36.719 --> 03:14:37.659]  It might be legitimate.
[03:14:37.659 --> 03:14:38.940]  It might not be legitimate.
[03:14:39.180 --> 03:14:39.700]  We'll find it.
[03:14:39.760 --> 03:14:44.219]  But you should probably treat it as illegitimate until proven otherwise.
[03:14:45.579 --> 03:14:50.920]  But also, you should treat it as legitimate as possible and get rid of it as fast as you possibly can.
[03:14:51.399 --> 03:14:54.180]  Anybody that's listening to this, you need to call your city councils.
[03:14:54.479 --> 03:14:55.959]  You need to call your state AGs.
[03:14:55.959 --> 03:15:03.739]  You need to call as many authoritarian figures as you possibly can to let them know that it's a scamdemic and you're not going to put up with it, and you will bring protests.
[03:15:04.079 --> 03:15:13.780]  And they might not listen to you, but at least, you know, the general population calls ahead of time instead of reacting, you're just ahead of it.
[03:15:14.079 --> 03:15:22.940]  Because, again, I've been telling you guys through this audience and in my protest with the Gates Foundation that they're not going to stop.
[03:15:23.100 --> 03:15:28.540]  They've literally determined that we don't have human rights, but they just don't know how to kill us off.
[03:15:28.870 --> 03:15:30.709]  In a way where it's unnoticed.
[03:15:30.829 --> 03:15:34.229]  And so they're using your normalcy bias to the situation around you.
[03:15:34.389 --> 03:15:35.930]  The buildings are still here.
[03:15:36.190 --> 03:15:37.750]  Your fast food's still available.
[03:15:37.750 --> 03:15:39.930]  So you think that the world's still around you.
[03:15:39.969 --> 03:15:40.690]  It's fine.
[03:15:40.750 --> 03:15:41.329]  It's copacetic.
[03:15:41.329 --> 03:15:41.770]  It's not.
[03:15:41.909 --> 03:15:47.930]  You are about ready to get hit with another biowarm attack through the vaccines that sheds onto you.
[03:15:49.269 --> 03:15:49.989]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:15:50.290 --> 03:15:56.569]  I mean, as you were speaking, it reminded me what happened a couple of weeks ago in Congress with the $1.2 trillion omnibus bill that failed it.
[03:15:56.690 --> 03:15:58.049]  It had bipartisan support.
[03:15:58.170 --> 03:15:59.870]  It had the votes at the beginning of the day.
[03:15:59.989 --> 03:16:05.030]  And by the end of the day, it didn't have the votes because so much awareness happened in such a short period of time.
[03:16:05.530 --> 03:16:13.489]  I mean, we successfully, as the people of the United States of America, convinced Congress to vote against a bill that would have given them all raises.
[03:16:14.709 --> 03:16:17.170]  We know how corrupt and selfish and greedy they are.
[03:16:17.989 --> 03:16:26.250]  It would have been $1.2 trillion in deep state funding going to organizations and businesses and contractors in which they're all personally invested in.
[03:16:26.569 --> 03:16:36.040]  They denied themselves a tremendous amount of money because the political backlash was more painful Thank you.
[03:16:37.579 --> 03:16:42.879]  Thank you.
[03:16:42.879 --> 03:16:45.059]  Thank you.
[03:16:58.129 --> 03:16:58.829]  Call everyone.
[03:16:59.010 --> 03:16:59.489]  Write letters.
[03:16:59.729 --> 03:17:00.610]  Blow up their phones.
[03:17:00.790 --> 03:17:01.770]  Let's make it go viral.
[03:17:01.950 --> 03:17:05.670]  Let's make it go omnibus viral that we're not going to fall for this bird flu crap.
[03:17:06.540 --> 03:17:11.700]  We're not gonna allow the Gavin Newsom's and others to declare states of emergency because one person in Louisiana gets the flu.
[03:17:11.920 --> 03:17:18.639]  We're not gonna allow Joe Biden to inoculate 5 million Americans with an experimental mRNA flu vaccine for a flu that doesn't even spread from person to person.
[03:17:18.799 --> 03:17:28.540]  We're not gonna let them hijack our agriculture, seal all the land, buy all the land, then regulate all of the cattle and livestock away so we don't have any chickens, we don't have any cows.
[03:17:31.549 --> 03:17:41.290]  And we're not gonna let them get away with investing in artificial meat companies and then pushing that on us, that unhealthy trash, all while they contaminate our air with chemtrails.
[03:17:41.430 --> 03:17:44.790]  They contaminate our water with fluoride and atrazine.
[03:17:44.909 --> 03:17:47.969]  They contaminate our food with preservatives and food colorings.
[03:17:48.069 --> 03:17:49.350]  And then they try to inoculate us.
[03:17:49.819 --> 03:17:52.540]  And then they force us to inoculate our children if they want to go to school.
[03:17:52.760 --> 03:17:55.639]  Schools we don't want to send them to, but we have to because inflation is so bad.
[03:17:55.739 --> 03:18:04.479]  I mean, they're taxing us, they're inoculating us, they're infecting us with not only the woke mind virus, but every cancer you can possibly imagine.
[03:18:05.739 --> 03:18:09.239]  And the best way to fight back is by going to thealexjonesstore.com.

[03:19:43.540 --> 03:19:47.819]  I've talked a lot about the UN, the WF's own admissions for decades.
[03:19:47.819 --> 03:19:53.100]  They would use the threat of viruses to bring in their world government, their cashless society tracking system.
[03:19:53.280 --> 03:20:04.059]  But another key component is the post-industrial world, the Rio de Janeiro, 1992. Agenda 21 meeting where they created the global treaty that almost all nations signed on to.
[03:20:04.139 --> 03:20:11.219]  The US didn't sign on to it, but Herbert Walker Bush had it implemented and we're still living under it today.
[03:20:11.520 --> 03:20:17.360]  Trump needs to pull us out of those treaties in 21 and a half days when he gets into office.
[03:20:17.500 --> 03:20:27.739]  I mean, you've seen Hotez and Tedros of the WHO and others saying they're gonna use a new pandemic To block Trump's agenda and other populist movements around the world, now they've launched it, now they're doing it.
[03:20:27.920 --> 03:20:34.079]  So it also destroys the food supply, the beef, the chickens, they're doing it in Australia, Europe, now here.
[03:20:34.360 --> 03:20:49.979]  It's all about destroying the grassroots economy to consolidate control, to make us poor, so they can dictate the terms of our surrender, so that we're so poor, the average person wants a universal basic income, controlled by the cashless society, social credit score.
[03:20:50.270 --> 03:20:53.610]  This is economic warfare or siege against the people of the planet.
[03:20:53.809 --> 03:20:56.930]  That's what the carbon taxes, all of it is about.
[03:20:57.129 --> 03:21:09.930]  So just like global warming or man-made climate change is a fraud, this is all part of the same plan to teach you that humans are bad and that the world's not worth living in and you should all just give up because the world's gonna end anyways because of climate change.
[03:21:10.360 --> 03:21:15.520]  And then as the world breaks down and falls apart, they say, oh, it's global warming causing mass starvation in war.
[03:21:15.659 --> 03:21:16.600]  It's global warming.
[03:21:16.760 --> 03:21:23.760]  It's our fault when it's the policies of cutting off the food, cutting off the fertilizer, cutting off the energy, destroying agriculture.
[03:21:24.079 --> 03:21:25.319]  This is their admitted plan.
[03:21:25.459 --> 03:21:30.399]  John Kerry this year repeatedly said, we've got to get rid of half the farms or people will starve.
[03:21:31.049 --> 03:21:32.469]  Well, they're the ones starving people.
[03:21:32.629 --> 03:21:34.350]  It wasn't COVID that killed all these people.
[03:21:34.469 --> 03:21:35.930]  It was the lockdowns around the world.
[03:21:36.270 --> 03:21:37.350]  That's what's happening.
[03:21:37.489 --> 03:21:41.790]  And we've got to stop this death cult agenda, this depopulation agenda.
[03:21:42.090 --> 03:21:52.489]  This is all Agenda 21 now going into Agenda 2030. Agenda 21 was 1992 to 2000. Then we're now in Agenda 2030, which is the collapse of civilization by design.
[03:21:52.649 --> 03:21:56.969]  This is a declared war against all humans on Earth by the globalists.
[03:22:00.209 --> 03:22:06.110]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[03:22:10.770 --> 03:22:25.149]  Alright folks, this is Chase Geiser hosting the Alex Jones Show for the next 22 minutes and 6 seconds before the great, incredible, esteemed Maria Z takes over on The War Room at 3pm Central Time until 6pm Central Time.
[03:22:25.860 --> 03:22:27.579]  I'll be back in studio tomorrow as well.
[03:22:27.799 --> 03:22:39.180]  Alex Jones will be back in studio on Thursday in person, and you will be seeing more reports from him in the coming days until he's back physically in the command center.
[03:22:39.639 --> 03:22:40.819]  Let's go to Brett in Arizona.
[03:22:40.819 --> 03:22:41.959]  Brett, you've been waiting patiently.
[03:22:42.100 --> 03:22:42.620]  What's on your mind?
[03:22:44.500 --> 03:22:45.260]  Hey, how's it going, Chase?
[03:22:45.440 --> 03:22:46.479]  Merry Christmas, Happy New Year.
[03:22:46.700 --> 03:22:47.719]  Merry Christmas, Happy New Year.
[03:22:48.520 --> 03:22:49.139]  Yes, sir.
[03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:52.799]  So I just kind of want to ask your opinion here.
[03:22:53.520 --> 03:22:56.459]  It just seems like we just keep getting bombarded by these guys.
[03:22:56.739 --> 03:22:57.700]  Like, you know, the global elites.
[03:22:57.819 --> 03:22:59.459]  We got the new pandemic coming.
[03:22:59.860 --> 03:23:04.520]  We still haven't had a really unresolved from, like, the Hunter Biden laptop January 6th.
[03:23:04.639 --> 03:23:06.040]  I mean, the list goes on and on and on.
[03:23:07.159 --> 03:23:22.600]  Basically, my confidence level would be kind of more into Doge than anything at this point and probably RFK. But on the other side, I do have a little bit of doubt, Chase, that we won't see a lot of relief that we would really love just because there's so much.
[03:23:23.190 --> 03:23:23.510]  Sure.
[03:23:24.389 --> 03:23:28.889]  We have such a plate full of all these things that these guys need to get to, insider trading.
[03:23:29.049 --> 03:23:30.229]  I mean, go down the list.
[03:23:31.010 --> 03:23:40.250]  So I want to ask your opinion, how confident you think you are that a lot of these problems will get some kind of solution, resolution somewhere, some kind of justice, you know?
[03:23:40.350 --> 03:23:42.530]  Yeah, that's a great question, man, and it's a hard one to answer.
[03:23:43.069 --> 03:23:46.370]  I think we're going to see a lot of progress over the course of the next four years.
[03:23:46.870 --> 03:24:02.750]  But if we want to solve the problems that we have in the United States of America, There are some radical things that we can do right away, like defunding, firing bureaucrats, removing officials from the head of these organizations,
[03:24:02.969 --> 03:24:05.469]  departments, institutions like the FBI, CIA, and others.
[03:24:06.389 --> 03:24:08.590]  All that stuff can be done immediately, stroke of a pen.
[03:24:09.110 --> 03:24:32.870]  But if we want to fundamentally fix this country into the extended and definite future, We have to have the conviction and resolve and determination to continue as a people to make the right decision in who we elect to lead us in 2028,
[03:24:33.290 --> 03:24:41.989]  in 2032, 2036, and in 2040. We need like four good ones in a row, folks.
[03:24:43.069 --> 03:24:45.690]  Trump is not going to be able to solve all of our problems in the next four years.
[03:24:46.149 --> 03:24:50.590]  Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy through Doge, they're not going to be able to solve all of our problems in the next four years.
[03:24:51.010 --> 03:24:54.590]  RFK Jr., not going to be able to solve all of our problems in the next four years.
[03:24:55.569 --> 03:24:56.770]  Major dent, yes.
[03:24:58.190 --> 03:25:02.649]  But we have to decide now that we're not going to fall for any of the lies that are going to be told about them.
[03:25:03.969 --> 03:25:12.709]  Any of the blame that is going to be thrown upon them over the course of the next four years for whatever problems arise or obstacles arise or issues arise.
[03:25:13.190 --> 03:25:17.309]  Because everything bad that happens over the next four years, they're just going to blame it on populism.
[03:25:18.110 --> 03:25:22.229]  And they're going to try to use that to manipulate the people into giving up on it.
[03:25:23.069 --> 03:25:25.069]  And going right back to where we were.
[03:25:25.629 --> 03:25:32.270]  It's so easy to tear down progress, but it takes so long and such determination to build it up.
[03:25:32.709 --> 03:25:44.110]  So we have to decide now that we are not sprinting Toward victory, we are in a long-distance run toward victory.
[03:25:44.209 --> 03:25:49.090]  This is not a short-distance race against the New World Order.
[03:25:49.190 --> 03:25:50.149]  This is a marathon.
[03:25:50.729 --> 03:25:57.610]  And with the same audacity and courage and determination and bravery, the first marathon was run.
[03:25:59.770 --> 03:26:06.129]  We must pursue this victory over the course of years and years.
[03:26:06.229 --> 03:26:07.329]  I mean, it'll be my lifetime.
[03:26:08.559 --> 03:26:09.540]  To solve all these problems.
[03:26:09.819 --> 03:26:10.360]  Eric in New York.
[03:26:10.500 --> 03:26:11.139]  Eric, what's on your mind?
[03:26:12.639 --> 03:26:13.819]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:26:13.940 --> 03:26:14.260]  How you doing?
[03:26:14.500 --> 03:26:14.700]  Good.
[03:26:16.360 --> 03:26:27.079]  Listen, just for the record, I'm probably the only non-J6 or J6. I won't be taking the offer of a pardon because there's absolutely no need.
[03:26:27.239 --> 03:26:30.700]  I don't need to expand upon it unless you have a question on that.
[03:26:30.899 --> 03:26:38.090]  As far as the man that came on that I really had a lot of empathy for with his Not seeing his wife.
[03:26:38.629 --> 03:26:44.329]  I'm going to assume she's a quote-unquote foreigner or something like that, trying to get the green card, all that nonsense.
[03:26:44.729 --> 03:26:47.389]  All I can say is get away from the bar attorneys.
[03:26:47.670 --> 03:26:51.469]  Okay, there's not a single bar attorney that belongs in this country, by the way.
[03:26:52.010 --> 03:26:53.569]  Okay, so they're not your friend.
[03:26:53.569 --> 03:26:54.690]  They're not helping you.
[03:26:55.090 --> 03:26:59.969]  And reach out to me or people like me.
[03:27:00.049 --> 03:27:01.670]  We can help you with that.
[03:27:01.870 --> 03:27:04.110]  Well, where can the listeners find you?
[03:27:05.360 --> 03:27:05.760]  Say what?
[03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:07.319]  Where can the listeners find you?
[03:27:08.700 --> 03:27:09.620]  I have a website.
[03:27:09.819 --> 03:27:10.620]  You can get the contact.
[03:27:11.020 --> 03:27:14.379]  It's S-A-N-S Don Memetics.
[03:27:14.540 --> 03:27:15.600]  Like, without memetics.
[03:27:16.280 --> 03:27:17.299]  So I can just spell it.
[03:27:18.680 --> 03:27:19.340]  Okay, great.
[03:27:19.540 --> 03:27:19.840]  Awesome.
[03:27:20.059 --> 03:27:20.739]  Eric, thanks for your call.
[03:27:20.819 --> 03:27:21.299]  I appreciate it.
[03:27:21.459 --> 03:27:22.559]  Let's go to Andrew in New York.
[03:27:22.680 --> 03:27:23.479]  Andrew, what's on your mind?
[03:27:26.260 --> 03:27:27.040]  Are you there, Andrew?
[03:27:27.659 --> 03:27:28.879]  Okay, so...
[03:27:28.879 --> 03:27:33.600]  Yeah, the people have to be, like, the most important part.
[03:27:33.739 --> 03:27:52.069]  Like, We're good to go.
[03:27:57.670 --> 03:28:13.409]  It wouldn't be, like, the thing is with that, that it affects the job pool, it affects people's, like, salary, like, it's, like, millions of, like, foreigners, like, Obviously it's the legal ones, but still millions of them, and it affects the wages,
[03:28:13.549 --> 03:28:13.850]  you know?
[03:28:13.950 --> 03:28:14.610]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:28:14.829 --> 03:28:23.010]  We should absolutely not be bringing anybody into this country who is not an American citizen if it harms the American people in any way, shape, or form.
[03:28:23.090 --> 03:28:24.250]  Andrew, I totally agree with you.
[03:28:24.350 --> 03:28:25.090]  Jefferson in Virginia.
[03:28:25.229 --> 03:28:26.350]  Jefferson, it's good to hear from you again.
[03:28:26.350 --> 03:28:26.909]  How are you, sir?
[03:28:28.709 --> 03:28:29.129]  Hey, Chase.
[03:28:29.250 --> 03:28:29.950]  You're doing a great job.
[03:28:30.129 --> 03:28:30.530]  Thank you.
[03:28:30.670 --> 03:28:30.969]  Thank you.
[03:28:32.209 --> 03:28:42.969]  Yeah, I think what needs to happen, what catalyst will speed this along so maybe we can get all these things solved in four years would be a Truth and Reconciliation Commission office, much like Doge.
[03:28:43.209 --> 03:28:45.069]  But do we understand how this works?
[03:28:45.209 --> 03:28:50.010]  In other words, somebody like Tony Fauci would get a private summons from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
[03:28:50.649 --> 03:28:52.989]  I think?
[03:29:07.210 --> 03:29:10.010]  I think?
[03:29:29.229 --> 03:29:37.510]  And we can avoid putting people on trial, which will take forever, and then they'll have appeals, and then they'll appeal to convictions, and we'll never get anywhere.
[03:29:37.870 --> 03:29:39.129]  Well, there's one way to do that.
[03:29:39.290 --> 03:29:45.090]  I mean, Trump could say, hey, look, I will pardon these people if they confess and compel them to confess.
[03:29:46.030 --> 03:29:46.790]  Right, right.
[03:29:46.889 --> 03:29:49.549]  But what you have to do is let them do it privately first.
[03:29:49.549 --> 03:29:53.190]  If you do it publicly, then the public might intervene and be vigilante.
[03:29:53.629 --> 03:29:54.670]  And you don't want that.
[03:29:54.790 --> 03:29:55.270]  You want this...
[03:29:58.900 --> 03:30:02.440]  Well, I like how you called it truth and reconciliation because it's tarred.
[03:30:02.540 --> 03:30:04.379]  I mean, you can call it tarred and feathered, right?
[03:30:04.959 --> 03:30:08.739]  So you confess and then you get the soft mercy of forgiveness.
[03:30:09.139 --> 03:30:11.379]  I like it, Jefferson.
[03:30:11.659 --> 03:30:11.979]  I like it.
[03:30:12.159 --> 03:30:12.760]  One thing's for sure.
[03:30:12.799 --> 03:30:14.020]  There needs to be some sort of accountability.
[03:30:14.950 --> 03:30:19.989]  And, you know, the fact of the matter is we don't even need their confession because we have all the evidence needed to prosecute them.
[03:30:20.090 --> 03:30:28.049]  It's not like we require them to admit what they did or apologize for what they did because we know that if they apologize, they'll just be making it up for the sake of sympathy.
[03:30:28.370 --> 03:30:29.889]  They're not really sorry about what they do.
[03:30:29.989 --> 03:30:46.620]  You can't We're good to go.
[03:30:53.940 --> 03:31:00.440]  But it won't be genuine, and we don't need them to confess because we already have all of the proof and the evidence that they're guilty of the crimes that they've committed.
[03:31:00.600 --> 03:31:07.659]  I mean, we know that Anthony Fauci lied in Congress about gain-of-function research and whether or not it was being funded, and it's documented that he lied.
[03:31:07.719 --> 03:31:08.559]  We already have all the proof.
[03:31:08.600 --> 03:31:09.620]  Why don't we just prosecute him?
[03:31:09.700 --> 03:31:10.239]  Judy in Florida.
[03:31:10.360 --> 03:31:11.059]  Judy, what's on your mind?
[03:31:13.159 --> 03:31:13.860]  Yeah, Chase.
[03:31:13.979 --> 03:31:15.000]  It's good to talk to you.
[03:31:15.620 --> 03:31:16.399]  Fauci's just...
[03:31:16.399 --> 03:31:18.879]  He's three feet, two inches tall.
[03:31:19.100 --> 03:31:20.520]  I mean, let's get down to brass here.
[03:31:22.139 --> 03:31:22.879]  I am...
[03:31:23.329 --> 03:31:29.190]  I've got, like, I put down notes, but I know I'm going to get to one or two things because I know I'm just calling.
[03:31:29.870 --> 03:31:30.290]  That's okay.
[03:31:30.350 --> 03:31:41.190]  But anybody that wants to look at a figure like an Elon Musk, go to 2 Corinthians 11, verse 14. That gives you my perspective on someone like him.
[03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:45.969]  But we're under unrestricted warfare, in my opinion.
[03:31:46.530 --> 03:31:47.969]  And I look at a...
[03:31:49.639 --> 03:32:01.579]  Lena Nguyen and I look at Vivek Ramaswamy and they have a lot in common in that they're people that are out of the BRICS countries, for one thing.
[03:32:02.760 --> 03:32:08.139]  Vivek is a globalist and I think he is a master manipulator.
[03:32:08.899 --> 03:32:31.370]  I think that it was a trial balloon that was put up in the air regarding the H-1B visas because They maybe wanted to gauge what the American population was going to say about keeping or retaining these visas for these people that are taking American men's and women's jobs.
[03:32:31.770 --> 03:32:48.149]  I mean, I know when the advent of the whole thing occurred, meaning the H-1B visas, I was dating someone when I first got out of my marriage that came over on a visa And I understood, and he talked about it with me,
[03:32:48.270 --> 03:32:55.450]  how he was trained by the man that he replaced and was going to get a severance to go nowhere in America.
[03:32:55.670 --> 03:33:00.290]  And that was a white American male that lost his job in America.
[03:33:00.690 --> 03:33:03.190]  That man had a family too, I'm sure.
[03:33:03.409 --> 03:33:09.549]  So it's complete bollocks regarding having that stay in effect.
[03:33:09.750 --> 03:33:20.709]  But what I'm trying to say is, You know, we're being attacked on all sides, and it's, you know, the visas, it's the illegals.
[03:33:20.950 --> 03:33:29.850]  I do not think that 2025 is going to be anything other than scorched earth, to be perfectly honest.
[03:33:30.010 --> 03:33:33.209]  I think something's going to happen, whatever it is.
[03:33:33.469 --> 03:33:36.229]  It could be just the repudiation of the dollar.
[03:33:36.250 --> 03:33:38.450]  But I'm not going to sit here with...
[03:33:39.190 --> 03:33:59.950]  We're good to go.
[03:34:01.440 --> 03:34:07.040]  And Jamie would give you a much bigger earful than me as to what's actually occurring.
[03:34:07.059 --> 03:34:09.299]  And he's shadow banned on YouTube for a reason.
[03:34:09.780 --> 03:34:10.879]  I will check him out.
[03:34:10.940 --> 03:34:12.540]  Thank you so much for your call and your thoughts on that.
[03:34:12.700 --> 03:34:17.719]  It's certainly the case that 2025 is gonna be incredibly difficult.
[03:34:17.979 --> 03:34:26.760]  I absolutely agree that the next four years, though I believe they will be better than the last four years, I do believe they will be more difficult.
[03:34:27.319 --> 03:34:28.940]  And it's not gonna be pie in the sky.
[03:34:28.940 --> 03:34:29.940]  It's gonna be challenging.
[03:34:29.959 --> 03:34:31.020]  It's gonna be hard work.
[03:34:31.200 --> 03:34:35.659]  We're only gonna fix this country by the sweat of our brow, and we have to be careful who we trust.
[03:34:36.309 --> 03:34:51.950]  And we can't idolize these people, these influencers, as false idols because whether it's Trump or Musk or Vivek or RFK or others who seem to be heroes of America because of what happened at this election on November 5th,
[03:34:52.170 --> 03:34:53.250]  they're all imperfect.
[03:34:55.469 --> 03:35:02.090]  They're all capable of betrayal and failure and all the sins that any man is capable of.
[03:35:02.170 --> 03:35:04.549]  And so I think that the truth will come out.
[03:35:04.709 --> 03:35:09.829]  I hope that you're wrong about Mosk and Vivek because they're both very influential and powerful people.
[03:35:10.540 --> 03:35:19.819]  But I also think that a healthy dose of skepticism is very good, and we should never make the mistake of idolizing these people beyond what is due.
[03:35:19.920 --> 03:35:26.000]  We should cautiously support them when they're correct, and we should vigorously oppose them when they are wrong.
[03:35:26.159 --> 03:35:26.920]  Jordan in New Jersey.
[03:35:27.159 --> 03:35:28.540]  Jordan, what is on your mind?
[03:35:30.180 --> 03:35:30.959]  Hi, Chase.
[03:35:32.360 --> 03:35:33.079]  Merry Christmas.
[03:35:33.879 --> 03:35:34.680]  Merry Christmas.
[03:35:35.219 --> 03:35:37.739]  Good tidings for the New Year to you and the InfoWars.
[03:35:37.860 --> 03:35:38.159]  Thank you.
[03:35:39.510 --> 03:35:51.549]  So, yeah, I just wanted to discuss this whole Leanna Nguyen appearance, which I think is just appalling, getting what she said in the past and the clips that you showed earlier.
[03:35:52.370 --> 03:36:00.610]  And it shows the failure of the whole truth movement in really going after these people and getting rid of these COVID actors.
[03:36:01.090 --> 03:36:06.489]  This is a person who was involved in the PSYOP, the Boston bombing as well.
[03:36:06.850 --> 03:36:08.690]  You know, she was there giving...
[03:36:09.200 --> 03:36:13.059]  You know, testimony as the trauma person at the local hospital.
[03:36:13.440 --> 03:36:17.319]  I mean, this person's been involved with a lot of things, and she's still running out there, given a platform.
[03:36:18.120 --> 03:36:21.079]  She needs to be put in jail, in my opinion, okay?
[03:36:21.299 --> 03:36:28.280]  And I respect Ron Johnson, but Anthony Fauci needs to be in jail, all right?
[03:36:28.440 --> 03:36:29.059]  Fauci definitely.
[03:36:29.739 --> 03:36:30.940]  Fauci's actually a criminal.
[03:36:31.299 --> 03:36:34.079]  Now, the Leanna Nguyen lady, maybe she's a criminal, maybe she isn't.
[03:36:34.100 --> 03:36:37.639]  She's definitely a liar, but Fauci's actually a criminal.
[03:36:39.049 --> 03:36:40.729]  Yeah, well, I think you should get the orders for him.
[03:36:40.889 --> 03:36:42.829]  So they're all part of the criminal conspiracy.
[03:36:43.110 --> 03:36:43.629]  So is Burke.
[03:36:43.989 --> 03:36:51.809]  These people shouldn't be able to just go on to Channel 2 News or whatever or CBS and make these pronouncements anymore.
[03:36:52.090 --> 03:37:03.049]  Now, this is interesting because we have Jimmy Carter's death at 100, the man who basically tried to institutionalize the Trilateral Commission through our government.
[03:37:03.569 --> 03:37:07.270]  All right, which brought in a whole host of things which have led to this.
[03:37:07.530 --> 03:37:10.370]  And homelessness is up 18% in the United States.
[03:37:10.629 --> 03:37:12.090]  So much for Habitat for Humanity.
[03:37:13.350 --> 03:37:13.829]  True.
[03:37:14.209 --> 03:37:14.790]  Another failure.
[03:37:15.510 --> 03:37:19.010]  Which is also a place where they wash a bunch of money and launder money as well.
[03:37:19.709 --> 03:37:20.690]  Donations from people.
[03:37:20.829 --> 03:37:20.969]  Sure.
[03:37:25.800 --> 03:37:49.819]  Which is part of the long-term plan of the Rockefellers and the Carnegies and so forth, which was documented very heavily and most assiduously through the Reese Committee and the Dodd Report and people like Renee Wormser as to the destruction of higher education in this country, which led to the point where you could have people like Leanna Nguyen show up and tell people things based upon bunk evidence and things that just defy basic common sense,
[03:37:49.959 --> 03:37:51.200]  you know, eighth grade biology.
[03:37:52.119 --> 03:37:57.299]  Or what used to be eighth grade biology, I don't know what they're teaching today, that most people would be able to easily refuse.
[03:37:57.899 --> 03:38:05.000]  So we have a long-term project, and your points about, well, we have to look beyond Trump are very well taken, Chase.
[03:38:05.440 --> 03:38:08.020]  And another aspect here, litmus test on Trump.
[03:38:08.260 --> 03:38:15.700]  If he doesn't come in and fire every U.S. attorney or as many as he can on day one, we're really in for it here, okay?
[03:38:15.979 --> 03:38:16.360]  100%.
[03:38:16.360 --> 03:38:19.239]  I want to say one thing about Musk and the shadow banning.
[03:38:19.420 --> 03:38:27.120]  My personal X account, which I've been documenting all kinds of things they've been doing, okay, because there is a technocratic attack on humanity, right?
[03:38:27.700 --> 03:38:29.520]  A conceived and contrived attack.
[03:38:30.020 --> 03:38:33.500]  And I've been labeled, and I don't know why I've been labeled.
[03:38:33.639 --> 03:38:40.399]  I've just been putting regular photos up, not trying to deceive people, and there is a chill that's being put on fully on X account.
[03:38:40.639 --> 03:38:42.200]  And I can report that as well.
[03:38:42.500 --> 03:38:55.020]  I'm, you know, the author of the Coronize, and you've spoken to me several times, coronize.com, I do many other things to obviously catalog and investigate all the technocratic attacks.
[03:38:55.319 --> 03:38:57.100]  And it is a technocratic attack.
[03:38:57.319 --> 03:39:06.620]  And one of the best catalogers of this, for people to get their heads around this and know, instead of just react to these people, like Leanna Wynn and all these operatives, is Patrick Wood and Anthony Sutton.
[03:39:07.379 --> 03:39:15.059]  Now, those texts are indispensable in understanding this so that you can have a 50,000-foot view on how to really deal with this.
[03:39:15.659 --> 03:39:20.440]  These people need to be put in jail or be threatened with jail so that they give up the superior.
[03:39:20.979 --> 03:39:25.780]  They should be threatened with all kinds of prosecutions, and that's the only way you're going to get the information necessary.
[03:39:26.120 --> 03:39:30.540]  It's very disappointing for me to hear Ron Johnson talking about, oh, I don't care if Anthony Fauci goes to jail.
[03:39:30.700 --> 03:39:33.979]  You should, because that's the only way this canary is going to sink.
[03:39:34.500 --> 03:39:35.760]  I just want to thank you for your time.
[03:39:35.879 --> 03:39:36.659]  I know you've got to get going.
[03:39:36.940 --> 03:39:37.159]  Thanks, Jordan.
[03:39:37.299 --> 03:39:38.100]  I appreciate it.
[03:39:38.139 --> 03:39:39.239]  Those are all great points.
[03:39:40.000 --> 03:39:41.340]  100% agree with everything you said.
[03:39:41.440 --> 03:39:41.959]  Ray in Tennessee.
[03:39:42.200 --> 03:39:42.920]  Ray, what's on your mind?
[03:39:45.149 --> 03:39:46.110]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:39:46.290 --> 03:39:49.709]  Listen, so I wanted an update on, can you hear me?
[03:39:49.969 --> 03:39:50.270]  Yep.
[03:39:50.729 --> 03:39:54.649]  I wanted to get an update on what's going on at the auction with InfoWars.
[03:39:54.829 --> 03:40:02.389]  So there's those of us out here that don't have a life, and like, we have InfoWars on the TV 24-7.
[03:40:02.950 --> 03:40:07.629]  And that night when, like, Owen was giving us the countdown, man, that hit home.
[03:40:07.950 --> 03:40:11.190]  I know we'd had the ups and downs, and you guys have been on the forefront with all that.
[03:40:11.350 --> 03:40:12.489]  It's got to be hell for you all.
[03:40:12.549 --> 03:40:13.729]  Are we here or we're not here?
[03:40:14.090 --> 03:40:15.430]  And, you know, it's hard for us.
[03:40:15.530 --> 03:40:17.190]  We can only imagine what you guys went through.
[03:40:17.409 --> 03:40:20.270]  So, like, that hit home, and I'm like, well, what am I going to do?
[03:40:20.530 --> 03:40:20.870]  Yeah.
[03:40:20.870 --> 03:40:31.270]  Because I am still eating peanut butter, drinking coffee, eating flour, and oats, and all the stuff I stocked up on two years ago when Alex said, prices are going to double?
[03:40:31.409 --> 03:40:32.309]  You better stock up.
[03:40:32.389 --> 03:40:33.209]  Well, I did all that.
[03:40:33.250 --> 03:40:36.030]  And, of course, my kids thought I was a little bit conspiracy theory.
[03:40:36.530 --> 03:40:38.829]  She said, the twins, I got to tell you now, guess what?
[03:40:38.930 --> 03:40:43.290]  They listen to Alex Jones and you guys now because they're like, damn, mom.
[03:40:43.649 --> 03:40:44.750]  You know, I was like, yeah.
[03:40:47.190 --> 03:40:48.389]  Prices doubled, right?
[03:40:48.590 --> 03:40:53.549]  Everything that was predicted, and of course Alex is human like the rest of us, but man, sure appreciate what you do.
[03:40:54.030 --> 03:41:05.209]  Just wanted an update and just a P.S. If you guys could please, really, I know there's been changes, like it's ATN or it's Alex Jones, like I know it's been up and down for you guys more than anybody.
[03:41:05.389 --> 03:41:07.149]  We really need to know where you go.
[03:41:07.389 --> 03:41:09.049]  We need to know, like, be connected.
[03:41:20.130 --> 03:41:20.969]  Love you, Chase.
[03:41:21.229 --> 03:41:22.569]  Thanks for your patience.
[03:41:22.829 --> 03:41:23.350]  Glad you're there.
[03:41:23.489 --> 03:41:23.790]  Love you.
[03:41:23.870 --> 03:41:24.309]  Thank you for your call.
[03:41:24.409 --> 03:41:24.909]  Great question.
[03:41:25.110 --> 03:41:27.690]  So here's the deal with InfoWars.
[03:41:27.950 --> 03:41:30.190]  And I don't want to say too much because it's not my place to do it.
[03:41:30.229 --> 03:41:32.409]  Alex can update you on all the details.
[03:41:33.579 --> 03:41:47.579]  But we had a very good court ruling a number of weeks ago when the judge basically refused to award the auction bid to The Onion, owned by Global Tetrahedron.
[03:41:48.079 --> 03:41:56.500]  Now the trustee advocated for The Onion to be able to win the bid, even though they didn't have the highest bid.
[03:41:57.299 --> 03:42:01.799]  But the judge also refused to award the bid to the highest bidder.
[03:42:05.070 --> 03:42:14.850]  And gave the trustee 30 days to come up with some sort of a solution and try to find a way to sell Infowars for more money in a more transparent way.
[03:42:16.129 --> 03:42:20.950]  And so we have major core developments that are gonna unfold this month, next month.
[03:42:21.069 --> 03:42:25.090]  We could be shut down as early as January 15th or in the coming months.
[03:42:25.629 --> 03:42:27.170]  And so we are not out of the woods.
[03:42:27.309 --> 03:42:28.389]  We don't know what's gonna happen.
[03:42:28.690 --> 03:42:39.979]  There have been more details, more developments, which, like I said, I don't feel comfortable Sharing with the audience, because it's Alex's place to share with you guys, but what's going to happen is one of two things.
[03:42:40.920 --> 03:42:51.079]  Either Infowars is going to be bought by someone who Alex is comfortable working with, or it's going to be bought by someone who Alex is not comfortable working with, and it's going to be shut down.
[03:42:52.180 --> 03:43:02.840]  In the event that a good buyer buys Infowars, we will stay on the air just as we are with all the same websites, all the same social media accounts, all the same shows, broadcastings of that nature.
[03:43:03.879 --> 03:43:16.600]  In the event that we are shut down, we will be broadcasting from the Alex Jones Network, which is our backup studio on at AJNLive or AlexJones.network.
[03:43:17.219 --> 03:43:18.959]  We're going to bring everybody we can with us.
[03:43:19.639 --> 03:43:21.079]  Owen, if he wants to come.
[03:43:21.239 --> 03:43:22.260]  Harrison, if he wants to come.
[03:43:22.399 --> 03:43:23.180]  Alex, the crew.
[03:43:23.620 --> 03:43:25.520]  Everybody's going to have an opportunity there at the Alex Jones Network.
[03:43:25.879 --> 03:43:27.979]  We are going to be on the air no matter what happens.
[03:43:29.959 --> 03:43:33.840]  It's just a question of In what way we're going to be on the air.
[03:43:33.959 --> 03:43:35.719]  We're going to be on the air as Infowars or the Alex Jones Network.
[03:43:36.760 --> 03:43:38.559]  But one thing is universally true.
[03:43:39.700 --> 03:43:41.959]  The AlexJonesStore.com is...
[03:43:42.780 --> 03:43:59.159]  The number one way that you can support us because no matter what happens to Infowars, the AlexJonesStore.com will fund the operation and ensure that Alex is always on the air, ensure that the crew can be hired, ensure that we are supported and funded and fueled to fight the new world order.
[03:43:59.280 --> 03:44:01.219]  So I don't know what's going to happen in the next month.
[03:44:01.500 --> 03:44:06.239]  I don't know if Infowars is going to get shut down or not or if a friendly buyer is going to come in and we're going to be fine.
[03:44:06.809 --> 03:44:09.129]  But we need your support just as much as we have.
[03:44:09.250 --> 03:44:10.370]  This battle is not over.
[03:44:10.530 --> 03:44:16.670]  We've just entered a new chapter in the saga of the New World Order versus Infowars and Alex Jones.
[03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:20.790]  So please go to thealexjonesstore.com right now and be the reason we will always be on the air.
[03:44:21.190 --> 03:44:22.409]  It's time to take action.
[03:44:22.750 --> 03:44:28.610]  So for a lot of you out there, this is free and you can make supplemental money very easily.
[03:44:28.930 --> 03:44:32.069]  I mean, I would imagine most people can make hundreds of bucks a month with their eyes closed.
[03:44:32.420 --> 03:44:37.959]  And if you really kick ass, thousands of dollars, even if you have a tiny, you know, X account or Facebook or whatever.
[03:44:38.239 --> 03:44:46.659]  But if you're a talk show host, I mean, you can make a living and finance your show and maybe even, you know, hire reporters or whatever.
[03:44:46.799 --> 03:44:48.079]  I mean, this is exciting.
[03:44:48.299 --> 03:44:51.379]  So go now to thelshostore.com.
[03:44:51.540 --> 03:44:52.440]  And one other thing.
[03:44:52.719 --> 03:44:55.479]  There are five limited edition fundraiser posters.
[03:44:55.639 --> 03:45:01.120]  And by fundraiser, everything raises funds there, but the t-shirts cost like 16, 17 bucks a piece before you buy them.
[03:45:01.260 --> 03:45:08.239]  And then the sponsor gets half, we get half, and to run all this and build a new network as a backup, you know, we're squeaking by.
[03:45:08.500 --> 03:45:15.299]  But when something says fundraiser on it, like a t-shirt that's cost double, or a poster, yeah, the poster costs five, six bucks.
[03:45:15.700 --> 03:45:19.079]  I mean, the shipping, we ship it in the special packaging costs as much as the poster itself.
[03:45:19.670 --> 03:45:23.309]  So we're, you know, six, seven, eight, nine bucks for the poster cost with the packaging.
[03:45:23.469 --> 03:45:25.489]  And then we're selling it for 25, 30 bucks.
[03:45:25.649 --> 03:45:27.430]  That's because there's some real markup in there to fund it.
[03:45:27.510 --> 03:45:28.850]  So you know you're buying something.
[03:45:29.010 --> 03:45:31.209]  There's a memento that you really backed what we're doing.
[03:45:31.729 --> 03:45:34.989]  The campaign coins, challenge coins, they're all there.
[03:45:36.229 --> 03:45:39.450]  So the posters run from $19.95 to $29.95.
[03:45:39.889 --> 03:45:42.549]  And we'll have new limited edition posters after that.
[03:45:43.030 --> 03:45:48.350]  But the posters on January 6th will be no more.
[03:45:49.239 --> 03:45:53.959]  They're limited edition, so if you get your order in by then, you will get the poster because they're current on demand.
[03:45:53.959 --> 03:45:54.620]  They're in Arkansas.
[03:45:55.180 --> 03:45:57.399]  If you want one of these posters, there they are.
[03:45:57.879 --> 03:46:01.819]  And again, you've got until January 6th to get your order in.
[03:46:01.959 --> 03:46:03.159]  They look great hanging on the wall.
[03:46:03.219 --> 03:46:05.420]  We got them hanging here in The office.
[03:46:05.700 --> 03:46:07.840]  And I designed all of these.
[03:46:08.040 --> 03:46:13.319]  My favorite is the Trump graph that I showed the day before the election that predicted the election.
[03:46:13.459 --> 03:46:15.500]  I said, she's going to try to steal it, but it's going to fail.
[03:46:15.719 --> 03:46:20.739]  So the blue line goes up and goes straight up, but it's not enough fraud to overpower the landslide.
[03:46:20.879 --> 03:46:22.899]  And that's actually the graph that actually happened.
[03:46:23.280 --> 03:46:24.360]  The key battlegrounds.
[03:46:24.559 --> 03:46:26.299]  So you talk about nailing it, baby.
[03:46:26.620 --> 03:46:27.520]  That's my favorite.
[03:46:27.639 --> 03:46:28.440]  I designed that one.
[03:46:28.620 --> 03:46:30.739]  And then the 47th one I designed as well.
[03:46:30.879 --> 03:46:31.979]  So I designed those.
[03:46:32.659 --> 03:46:34.940]  I did not design the Darkest Hour one, but there it is.
[03:46:35.040 --> 03:46:35.719]  Thank you for the support.
[03:46:35.840 --> 03:46:36.420]  I'm done plugging.
[03:46:36.860 --> 03:46:44.440]  I've just been looking at all the attacks and our victories in court, and I realized how much money it takes to take these people on, and they are so pissed we're still on air.
[03:46:45.139 --> 03:46:47.159]  And I have hired high-powered lawyers.
[03:46:47.280 --> 03:46:47.979]  That's why we're winning.
[03:46:49.100 --> 03:46:58.399]  And they tell me, But my lawyers are working seven days a week.
[03:46:58.979 --> 03:47:00.600]  Because I go and meet with them almost every day.
[03:47:00.760 --> 03:47:02.639]  And they call me at midnight and say, come to the office.
[03:47:02.680 --> 03:47:04.379]  I want you to read this and sign it, make sure it's accurate.
[03:47:04.540 --> 03:47:05.440]  I mean, we are...
[03:47:05.440 --> 03:47:13.180]  If I told you all the suits we filed on and all the crap we're doing to bloom, to the whole deep state, because I can't be on defense anymore.
[03:47:13.219 --> 03:47:13.920]  I've got to go on offense.
[03:47:14.579 --> 03:47:16.020]  It would take an hour to go over it all.
[03:47:17.059 --> 03:47:18.959]  But you want me to fight, I'm fighting.
[03:47:19.899 --> 03:47:20.219]  So...
[03:47:21.559 --> 03:47:30.020]  You're financing the current operation, you're financing the back of Palos Jones Network if it gets shut down, and that's still getting built and expanded, not, you know, a larger studio, almost done.
[03:47:31.149 --> 03:47:33.149]  And you're financing the legal defense and offense.
[03:47:33.389 --> 03:47:34.290]  I mean, this is a war.
[03:47:34.430 --> 03:47:35.489]  You want somebody to fight for you?
[03:47:35.989 --> 03:47:36.889]  I love it.
[03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:40.270]  I mean, I'm begging for you to keep me in the game, keep me in the fight, Coach.
[03:47:40.430 --> 03:47:41.870]  But I'm here, you're serving.
[03:47:42.209 --> 03:47:43.209]  You commissioned me.
[03:47:44.270 --> 03:47:50.190]  Look, I won't stop regardless of what happens, but I'm asking you to empower me, and I will give you everything I got.
[03:47:50.569 --> 03:47:56.889]  I'm so focused right now and so sick of this crap and the stuff they've been doing to my family behind the scenes, just absolutely criminal.
[03:47:57.489 --> 03:48:00.209]  And so all I'm asking for is the support to keep fighting.
[03:48:00.829 --> 03:48:02.350]  And we make it easy with incredible products, okay?
[03:48:02.450 --> 03:48:02.909]  I'm done.
