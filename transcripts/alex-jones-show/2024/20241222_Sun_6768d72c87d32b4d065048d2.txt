[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.960]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.159]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.079]  And never forget...
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:48.380]  The social engineers want you dumb, poor, and absolutely isolated because then they can control and run your life and shape civilization and human development in the way they see fit.
[00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:51.479]  And they've made the decision that humans are obsolete.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.939]  This is a literal war for existential survival.
[00:00:56.259 --> 00:01:09.209]  It's Sunday, December 22nd, 2024. I'm about to play for you one of the most thought-provoking historic exchanges I've ever seen.
[00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:39.640]  It really is a road marker or a directional point marking where we are in the history of the undeclared information war of really the last hundred years with behavioral psychologists in the West Engaging in a attempted operation to take a once free civilizational system and turn the population
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.079]  into mindless animals.
[00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:58.480]  I'm talking about John Lennon, the washed up corporate CNN operative, out traveling across the country trying to gaslight and brainwash people to listen to the corporate media when they gang up with a false narrative or propaganda.
[00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.629]  And in the end, he has to capitulate and admit that basically everybody's awake and nobody's listening to him.
[00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:06.189]  Here is the exchange.
[00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.849]  Who is the real president-elect, do you think?
[00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.210]  Donald Trump, I believe.
[00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.129]  Democratic lawmakers in Washington are calling Elon Musk, President Musk now, and they're saying Donald Trump is the vice president or the head of communications.
[00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.969]  What's, what's, what's, what's, wait a second.
[00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.949]  No, no one said that.
[00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.750]  Really?
[00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.449]  Have you not paid attention to him?
[00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.949]  Absolutely not.
[00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.509]  I'm paying attention to what I'm doing during my day so I can try and get a better life and get ahead.
[00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.750]  Okay, do you have your phone with you?
[00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:29.110]  I do.
[00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.610]  Why don't you Google right now, President Musk, and see what comes up.
[00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:32.870]  No.
[00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.889]  But that's already a loaded question, you realize.
[00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.129]  Tell me, give me the sources.
[00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.849]  Axios, Business Insider.
[00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:39.389]  We don't trust any of these.
[00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.050]  The common man doesn't trust any of this.
[00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.770]  ABC News, Washington Post, New York Times, The Atlantic.
[00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:46.469]  I don't trust any of these.
[00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:47.750]  I don't trust any of them.
[00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:49.129]  I don't trust any of these.
[00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.889]  We're the common man.
[00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.270]  We don't trust any of these.
[00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.889]  No one trusts the government.
[00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.789]  No one trusts the common news.
[00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.810]  We don't trust any of that anymore.
[00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.289]  Independent news, we are the ones that own the news now.
[00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:00.270]  People trust me.
[00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.569]  They don't trust MSNBC because I care and I'm actually one of them.
[00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.550]  I can't disagree with you.
[00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.810]  Okay.
[00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.629]  Well then.
[00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.530]  I get a lot of people coming to me saying, I only watch show.
[00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:10.830]  I don't watch corporate media anymore.
[00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:10.949]  Right.
[00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.330]  Notice what Lemon does in that exchange.
[00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.270]  He laughs.
[00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:16.949]  He ridicules.
[00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:18.909]  He tries to make the man look silly.
[00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:35.669]  List a bunch of corporate news that all repeat the same thing, like two men can have a baby, there are no XY chromosomes, there's no problem at the border, there's no inflation, Biden's smart as a tack, Kamala Harris is incredibly intelligent, Trump's gonna lose,
[00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:37.270]  on and on and on.
[00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.889]  And the man just says, we're the media.
[00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.370]  But the truth is, we've always been the news, we've always been the media.
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.319]  And if you go back around 100 years ago, there were newspaper articles about it.
[00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:48.719]  The big corporations were public.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:58.259]  The robber barons, literally the Rockefellers and others said, we can't allow the people to continue to break up our trust, break up our monopolies.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.240]  Stand up to us.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.860]  We've got to go out and buy up the media.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.919]  We've got to buy up the universities.
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.280]  We've got to buy up the journalism schools.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.280]  And we've got to get full control of the population.
[00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.139]  And if you go back 100 years ago, almost nobody was really awake to this takeover.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.300]  And then most people were born into it the last few generations.
[00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.910]  Television, corporate news, media, and just didn't even understand what was happening to them.
[00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:28.310]  But the last 30 years, the awakening's built and built and built, and now it's at a crescendo, and people are just laughing at the system, and their old tricks don't work anymore.
[00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:37.009]  Now I wanted to address, though, the main lie here in the propaganda, the supposed fact that Elon Musk is really the president.
[00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:41.829]  What's really behind this latest attack from the corporate media, the enemy of the people?
[00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.829]  Real power is in everyday people.
[00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:55.279]  And if you can control the algorithms of what they see, if you can control the narratives of what they believe through propaganda...
[00:04:55.279 --> 00:05:01.839]  Because President Musk told them!
[00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:06.100]  President Musk said, don't do it!
[00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:07.680]  Don't do it!
[00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:09.779]  Shut the government down!
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.480]  Imagine!
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.620]  What does he know?
[00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:17.420]  Oh, Elon Musk is not the president of the United States, no.
[00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.579]  Right now, he's vying for the position as leader of the free world.
[00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:25.220]  And Trump and he are not in competition.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.600]  They're in competition against the globalists.
[00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:37.660]  But as more people realize that, hey, there's a position to be the leader of the free world, that people want to be free instead of leaders of the New World Order, globalist, anti-human, asshole organization.
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.319]  I've been talking about this for decades and it's happening right now.
[00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:44.180]  Musk and the President of the United States.
[00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:47.360]  When it comes to the information war, he's the leader of the free world.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:55.579]  So on this very important Sunday, December 22nd broadcast, I want to just open the transmission up.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:06.800]  With the fact that we've been in an information war, an undeclared information war, really for all of civilization's recorded history, but it's gotten scientific.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:16.579]  It's been given psychological terms and names and has been really publicly funded by major Western governments for the last hundred years at a very intense level.
[00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:23.699]  And the Pentagon will tell you today, look it up on their own website, that over 90% of war is informational or information war.
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:36.139]  30 plus years ago, I began to really study what the Globals were up to and I came up with the name InfoWars because that was their own definition of what they were doing to us.
[00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:43.939]  But once you're aware of the operation, once you're aware of what their goals are, well then it doesn't have an effect on you anymore.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:54.680]  And so for you and I and most of the viewers and listeners that have been tuning in for many, many years, we already understand this, but now the general public is finding that out.
[00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:06.850]  We're good to go.
[00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:22.019]  People trust me more than they trust you.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.839]  You're known liars.
[00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:25.600]  And again, you and I get this already.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.519]  We're like, this is old news.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.019]  But it's not for the general public that is explosively becoming aware of this right now.
[00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:34.579]  So the big question is, what is the establishment going to do now?
[00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:37.389]  Who is the real president-elect, do you think?
[00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.750]  Donald Trump, one, I believe.
[00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:46.649]  Democratic lawmakers in Washington are calling Elon Musk, President Musk now, and they're saying Donald Trump is the vice president or the head of communications.
[00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:47.910]  What, what, what, what?
[00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.509]  Wait a second.
[00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:49.490]  No, no one said that.
[00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:50.290]  Really?
[00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.889]  Have you not watched and paid attention to this?
[00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:52.490]  Absolutely not.
[00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:56.050]  I'm paying attention to what I'm doing during my day so I can try and get a better life and get ahead.
[00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:57.290]  Okay, do you have your phone with you?
[00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:57.649]  I do.
[00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.189]  Why don't you Google right now?
[00:07:59.269 --> 00:07:59.730]  Yes, tell me.
[00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:01.149]  President Musk and see what comes up.
[00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.430]  No, but that's already a loaded question, you realize.
[00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:04.670]  Tell me, give me the sources.
[00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.410]  Axios, Business Insider.
[00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:07.949]  We don't trust any of these.
[00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.589]  The common man doesn't trust any of this.
[00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.290]  ABC News, Washington Post, New York Times, The Atlantic.
[00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.990]  Oh, keep going.
[00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:15.009]  I don't trust any of these.
[00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.269]  I don't trust any of them.
[00:08:16.449 --> 00:08:16.629]  Okay.
[00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:17.689]  I don't trust any of these.
[00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:18.449]  We're the common man.
[00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:19.790]  We don't trust any of these.
[00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.430]  No one trusts the government.
[00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:23.329]  No one trusts the common news.
[00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:24.370]  We don't trust any of that anymore.
[00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.829]  Independent news, we are the ones that own the news now.
[00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:28.810]  People trust me.
[00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.129]  They don't trust MSNBC because I care and I'm actually one of them.
[00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:34.090]  Can't disagree with you.
[00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:34.429]  Okay.
[00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.230]  Well then.
[00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.129]  I get a lot of people coming to me saying, I only watch show.
[00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.389]  I don't watch corporate media anymore.
[00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:39.529]  Right.
[00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:42.750]  So the new talking point, everywhere.
[00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:52.200]  Just like eight years ago that it was Russia secretly behind Trump and he wasn't really elected legitimately and he's for a foreign power.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.460]  Well, that's the globalist inverting reality.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.779]  They're the ones destroying sovereignty.
[00:08:55.919 --> 00:09:14.740]  They're the ones destroying our border, our currency, our culture, attacking our families, our very fabric of civilization through inflation and the whole leftist DEI. We're good to go.
[00:09:21.859 --> 00:09:24.399]  It wasn't any secret that Elon Musk was backing Trump.
[00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.809]  To say, oh, look, you're not getting the attention.
[00:09:54.129 --> 00:09:56.789]  Oh, Elon Musk is with the president, not you.
[00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.690]  Elon tells you everything to do.
[00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.710]  As if Trump's a child and will then go, well, I better listen to Lindsey Graham and the neocons.
[00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:11.950]  You know, if Elon's against war and if Elon is against these poison shots and so is RFK Jr., well, they're not really the president.
[00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.190]  I'm the president, so I'm going to sideline them.
[00:10:14.309 --> 00:10:17.610]  So that's really the attack within the attack right there.
[00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:19.429]  The good news is it's not working.
[00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:20.250]  The people are awake.
[00:10:21.419 --> 00:10:22.759]  The scams aren't working anymore.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:35.600]  They're attacking Trump's main intellectual support base that can help him get the right people into office to get the country stabilized, stop the wars, cheapen the cost of energy, lower inflation.
[00:10:35.919 --> 00:10:37.720]  And so Elon Musk is the bad guy.
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.860]  Well, Elon Musk wants to be attacked by this collapsing establishment.
[00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:46.460]  Elon Musk relishes that because he thinks in second and third and fourth order.
[00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:49.009]  Something the globalists don't do.
[00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:54.450]  I mean, they thought a mugshot of Trump was going to make people hate him.
[00:10:54.549 --> 00:10:58.970]  They thought all their lawfare was going to make people turn against him.
[00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:00.450]  They are disconnected.
[00:11:00.809 --> 00:11:02.269]  They are megalomaniacs.
[00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:08.789]  They're only thinking about having the power and control to crush somebody right now, even though it turns them into political martyrs.
[00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.870]  The same thing has happened to me.
[00:11:11.029 --> 00:11:17.669]  And now you've got Elon Musk being attacked and being demonized for saying, hey, Germany, It has tyrannical government.
[00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:22.649]  They arrest people that have been raped by Muslims for criticizing them, for raping them.
[00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.070]  The woman in the famous case just got more jail time than the rapist.
[00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.129]  And so Elon says, hey, that's wrong.
[00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:32.070]  You need AFD. You need to have populism and nationalism.
[00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.870]  And they say, oh, you're meddling in our elections.
[00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.570]  The EU has passed all these laws affecting the United States.
[00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.990]  They're trying to take over X. They're trying to criminally charge Elon Musk.
[00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:43.480]  That's what globalism is.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.559]  We've got the UN trying to pass global treaties to take control of our bodies.
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.759]  This is a globe.
[00:11:48.259 --> 00:11:53.399]  It's good for Americans to say what we think is wrong that's happening in Germany or Canada or California.
[00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:55.519]  But, you know, that's foreign interference.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.519]  But all their corporate media is just fine.
[00:11:58.659 --> 00:12:02.259]  But the good news is this will only continue to backfire on them.
[00:12:02.419 --> 00:12:07.899]  We'll talk about the huge global populist Victories here in just a moment.
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:21.080]  Across the planet, from Australia to South America, Central America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the UK, Canada, populist parties are now winning every major election.
[00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:24.200]  Trudeau is about to be forced to resign, his own party is saying.
[00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:28.320]  Same thing with Keira Starmer in the UK trying to cancel an upcoming election.
[00:12:28.659 --> 00:12:37.029]  The German government, because the other parties are being put out of office, want to ban the AFD. And then Elon Musk and myself and many others say that's wrong.
[00:12:37.169 --> 00:12:38.230]  That's tyrannical.
[00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.350]  And then we're supposedly the bad guys.
[00:12:41.909 --> 00:12:47.190]  Ladies and gentlemen, the EU is openly saying they're going to control the United States with their regulations.
[00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.809]  They're openly saying they're going to censor the American people.
[00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.289]  This is a global problem.
[00:12:53.789 --> 00:12:57.250]  Globalists and the WEF and the UN are a global threat.
[00:12:57.529 --> 00:12:58.009]  So...
[00:12:58.039 --> 00:13:16.519]  It's high time Americans stop psychologically being so isolationist and not knowing how the world works and being politically engaged and involved, not manipulating those governments, not going and lobbying and putting our people in like the UN and the globalists do to us and the CHICOMs and Israel and others and the UK. No,
[00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:26.559]  it's time for us to know how the world works so we can defend ourselves against these tyrannical countries and also from a distance promote Those that are standing up for freedom.
[00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:31.659]  That's what soft power and 1776 worldwide is all about.
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.000]  And that's why it's so exciting to be alive right now because the Great Awakening isn't just beginning.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.159]  We're deep into the middle of it and it's about to get a lot more wild.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:48.600]  And that is why I just want to celebrate this and thank God and thank all of you for taking action and thank Elon Musk and Donald Trump and so many others because we really are winning and this is historic.
[00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:52.370]  Oh, and one more point about the enemy of the people.
[00:13:52.669 --> 00:13:58.350]  You know, the dinosaur corporate media is the lie that Elon Musk is the president and not Trump.
[00:13:59.029 --> 00:14:00.870]  Elon Musk is a lot bigger than that now.
[00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:06.129]  He is leading the anti-globalist liberty movement worldwide.
[00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:08.389]  And I keep saying this for decades.
[00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:17.370]  Why didn't more people get on board being against the globalist tyrants when they're open to totalitarians that want to destroy industrial society and are anti-human?
[00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.350]  It's a no-brainer to get behind a pro-human movement.
[00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:30.340]  And so again, their whole system Of having total control over the people's mind is over.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:36.899]  And now that people understand that the globalists are such tyrants that have sworn an oath to their enslavement, it's game over.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.220]  So it's a smart move for Elon Musk to come in and champion liberty and freedom.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.580]  And he's taken every industry he's gotten a hold of and dominated it, taken a few levels.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.639]  Well, this is an industry.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.919]  This is our species.
[00:14:48.139 --> 00:14:48.820]  This is humanity.
[00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:53.299]  And so I expect him to be successful because I and many others are going to be helping him.
[00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:55.070]  History's happening now, folks.
[00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:59.149]  If you've been a leftist or a globalist or a transhumanist death cult member, give it up.
[00:14:59.309 --> 00:14:59.889]  Join us.
[00:15:00.029 --> 00:15:00.809]  Join Team Humanity.
[00:15:01.049 --> 00:15:02.110]  Come in for the big win.
[00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:04.750]  1776 Worldwide and Yacht.
[00:15:05.289 --> 00:15:06.870]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.230]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:15:11.319 --> 00:15:14.059]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host this evening.
[00:15:14.159 --> 00:15:19.500]  For the next three hours and 44 minutes, we will be taking your calls in the final hour of the broadcast today.
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.980]  Until then, it's going to be groundbreaking clips and analysis of all the latest developments.
[00:15:24.159 --> 00:15:26.279]  Alex Jones is absolutely right.
[00:15:26.279 --> 00:15:28.639]  All these attacks on Elon Musk are totally moot.
[00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:31.950]  Don Lemon has embarrassed himself time and time again.
[00:15:32.169 --> 00:15:36.450]  Most famously, I think, that most recent video that Alex showed in his report.
[00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:40.710]  And we are going to have more reports from Alex Jones throughout the broadcast today.
[00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.870]  Alex Jones will be back in studio tomorrow hosting the Alex Jones Show at 11 a.m.
[00:15:44.929 --> 00:15:47.990]  with Harrison Smith hosting the American Journal at 8 a.m.
[00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.149]  and Owen Schroer hosting the War Room at 3 p.m.
[00:15:51.289 --> 00:15:53.870]  all Central Time for this Christmas week.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:00.799]  Trump outlines plan to purge deep state and restore American greatness in second term.
[00:16:01.039 --> 00:16:02.700]  There was a five-hour broadcast.
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:09.480]  It was at least five hours of a live stream from the TPUSA America Fest, AmFest, as known collectively.
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.500]  And there were so many amazing speakers, so many amazing speakers.
[00:16:14.569 --> 00:16:16.309]  I want to start with clip number 50 here.
[00:16:16.429 --> 00:16:20.950]  This is Paxton teasing that he might be running for the Senate here in Texas.
[00:16:21.169 --> 00:16:25.809]  It seems about time that we had some real America First Republicans representing Texas.
[00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.590]  And I'll get into Dan Crenshaw and all the news with him later.
[00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:34.110]  But let's watch what Ken Paxton had to say in clip number 50. Why don't we start over here?
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.879]  Good afternoon, Mr. Attorney General.
[00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:37.639]  My name is Duke.
[00:16:37.799 --> 00:16:39.320]  I live in Williamson County, Texas.
[00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:40.120]  All right.
[00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:44.899]  I've personally written you letters and called your office encouraging you to run.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.620]  And my question is, when are you announcing that you're running against John Cornett for Senate?
[00:16:59.379 --> 00:17:00.539]  How about if I say this?
[00:17:00.659 --> 00:17:00.980]  Not yet.
[00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.450]  So we are definitely, I am praying about it.
[00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:06.990]  We are looking at that.
[00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.609]  I'm talking to a lot of people in Texas over the next couple months.
[00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.789]  And ask me that question in a couple of months and I'll have a different answer.
[00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:15.750]  So thank you.
[00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.150]  Let me ask this.
[00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:21.549]  This is like my first, I have not run a poll.
[00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:22.970]  So this will be my first poll.
[00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:23.869]  Who would want me to run?
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:45.480]  And as you likely know, Ken Paxton was the subject of leftist assaults in recent months, recent years, because of his leadership and his audacity to actually prosecute what needs to be prosecuted, stand up for Trump and America First and J6ers and those...
[00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.410]  From the January 6th committee, among other things.
[00:17:48.769 --> 00:18:10.990]  But this whole entire AmFest event is really interesting to me because I had the privilege of seeing what TP action looks like, what Turning Point action looks like when Alex Jones and I and Rob Dew and others went to the event earlier this year that was a TP action event when we were in Detroit.
[00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:14.559]  And we saw all of the energy.
[00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:27.500]  We saw what it was like when people saw Alice Jones take the sage and speak the truth about the globalists and the royal family and what's really going on with this battle between good and evil and this fight for sovereignty against the New World Order.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.240]  And this organization, backed by Charlie Kirk, has turned out to be a force to be reckoned with.
[00:18:33.319 --> 00:18:36.500]  I think Charlie Kirk is responsible in large for this Trump victory.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.119]  I know that he backed people like Cliff Maloney and P.A. Chase.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:48.019]  It was the reason that there were enough doorknockers and early votes for Republicans in Pennsylvania to ensure that we would win the state of Pennsylvania despite all of the cheating from the leftists.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:19:04.230]  But from Stone and Trump and others, we saw time and time again, remark after remark at this event, That really encouraged me, that really inspires me, that gave me a sense of optimism in a world where evil is prevalent in every single headline.
[00:19:04.369 --> 00:19:10.329]  This is Trump, for example, in clip number 51, saying that the woke agenda must stop.
[00:19:10.529 --> 00:19:10.930]  Let's watch.
[00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:14.450]  And woke has to stop.
[00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:18.769]  Because along with everything else, it's destroying our country.
[00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:20.549]  We're gonna stop woke.
[00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:22.069]  Woke.
[00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.490]  Woke is bullshit.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:45.559]  As an example, in addition to the military bases, I understand they want to now rename 14 ships.
[00:19:45.799 --> 00:19:46.859]  We want to rename them.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.680]  Some of these ships have had a great And glory has passed.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.240]  They want to take the name off and put another name down.
[00:19:53.299 --> 00:19:55.339]  I can imagine whose name they're going to put up.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.279]  Not going to happen with me.
[00:19:56.279 --> 00:20:00.700]  Here's Roger Stone in clip number 62 saying that we're about ready to enter a golden age.
[00:20:00.779 --> 00:20:07.920]  Now this is something that Trump said in the last week or two in some statements that were released to the public that we are about ready to enter a golden age.
[00:20:08.039 --> 00:20:11.240]  I believe Trump said the golden age of America has begun.
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:15.339]  Here is Stone reiterating those remarks right here in clip number 62 from the same event.
[00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.769]  America is about to enter a golden age.
[00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.049]  It is the age of Trump.
[00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:29.549]  It is an age of unprecedented peace, prosperity, security, and justice.
[00:20:32.279 --> 00:20:47.559]  This is a testimony to the persistence, to the resilience, to the stamina, to the strength, to the stubbornness, and I mean that in a positive sense, of the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln,
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.119]  Donald J. Trump.
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:56.339]  And the crowd here gave a standing ovation for Homan, who spoke as well.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.099]  This is clip number 64. I mean, just see this.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.740]  This is somebody that not a lot of people had heard of before his recent nomination.
[00:21:01.819 --> 00:21:06.440]  Obviously, he's been coming out in the media and talking about how from day one, we're going to start deportations.
[00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:08.240]  From day one, we're going to secure our border.
[00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:10.940]  This is clip number 64. This is what America wants.
[00:21:11.079 --> 00:21:11.380]  Let's watch.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.019]  Tom Homan takes the stage there, waving, standing ovation.
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:30.859]  And it's not just the big things like the nominations that are taking place, but in clip number 65, it's the little things as well, like Donald Trump insisting on doubling down on the notion that we in America say Merry Christmas.
[00:21:31.019 --> 00:21:33.180]  We don't say happy holidays like the Bidens.
[00:21:33.519 --> 00:21:35.559]  We don't say happy holidays like the leftists.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:41.480]  We simply say Merry Christmas because at the foundation of this country is a Christian theology and philosophy.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:46.400]  This is clip number 65. Well, hello, Arizona.
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.720]  It's great to be here.
[00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:49.640]  Nice to win the election.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.220]  Very nice to win.
[00:21:51.539 --> 00:21:54.700]  And I want to wish everybody a very Merry Christmas.
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.339]  They don't say that too much anymore.
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.640]  We say it.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.059]  And I'll show you some more clips from Trump at this event as well.
[00:22:03.259 --> 00:22:09.200]  It's all the things that you could imagine hearing from Trump, but it's the fact that it's just totally empowered by the will of the people now.
[00:22:09.299 --> 00:22:14.660]  There's a consensus, a cultural consensus in the United States of America that backs this, but it's not just Donald Trump.
[00:22:14.759 --> 00:22:15.539]  It's also Brett Cooper.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.859]  Brett Cooper formerly worked at the Daily Wire.
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.160]  She left over some controversy.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.400]  The details are yet to be clarified as to the nature in which she left.
[00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:36.950]  But here she is speaking on how change starts at home and really reinforcing the notion of the family unit, the nuclear family, and how important it is as the backbone of our civilization.
[00:22:37.109 --> 00:22:48.569]  Clip number 67. One of the biggest lies that I was told as a young woman was that getting married and then later starting a family would ruin my life, that it would hold me back.
[00:22:49.589 --> 00:22:51.769]  That I would be literally settling.
[00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.529]  And guys, I heard that from the left and the right.
[00:22:53.529 --> 00:22:55.430]  I heard that from people that I once respected.
[00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:03.289]  But I just want to tell you today, wholeheartedly, that my husband that is somewhere standing off stage, I don't know where he is!
[00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:04.170]  There he is!
[00:23:05.319 --> 00:23:06.819]  That he has made me...
[00:23:06.819 --> 00:23:09.180]  Oh my God, you're getting a standing ovation.
[00:23:09.579 --> 00:23:18.099]  That you have made me bolder and braver and more ambitious than I have ever been in my entire life because of your love.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:23.859]  He and our family and our communities, they form the basis of my life.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:29.660]  And it is within these communities that we create the most meaningful change.
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.200]  Because real change starts at home.
[00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:40.430]  There's so much that we can do online and in politics and there's so much that we can do and obviously TPSA has shown us that.
[00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:50.569]  But at the end of the day, change starts with your values and your personal integrity and your family and the life that you build together.
[00:23:51.130 --> 00:24:03.480]  Because when it comes down to it, in my opinion, the best way to win And she's 100% right.
[00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:06.039]  The best way to win is to live a great life.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.500]  The best revenge is success.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:19.299]  And this administration has already hit the ground running with the Department of Government Efficiency, all that has developed over the course of the last several months in terms of freedom of speech being fought for and upheld on the internet.
[00:24:21.559 --> 00:24:28.339]  Revelations about the corruption surrounding this omnibus bill that successfully shut it down even though they had enough votes at the beginning of the day.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:42.359]  By the end of the day, they didn't because everybody was made aware of all the corruption in the 1547 page omnibus bill that fueled the censorship complex, that fueled biolabs being developed all across the world.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.079]  And much of this administration has already begun because it begins with us.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.380]  It starts with us, this populist movement who spoke on November 5th.
[00:24:53.619 --> 00:24:59.740]  We have worked to support Trump and his administration, ensure that those who he nominates for key positions in his cabinet actually get through.
[00:24:59.839 --> 00:25:03.980]  And I think we're going to see that the vast majority, if not all of them, do get approved next month.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:10.339]  But I was pleased to see this short clip from Trump, clip number 68, where he said as early as 2 p.m.
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.240]  on January 20th, his administration will begin getting to work.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.359]  Let's watch.
[00:25:16.819 --> 00:25:22.299]  We're going to be fully operational, I would say, by about 2 o'clock on the 20th.
[00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:27.210]  20th of January.
[00:25:28.309 --> 00:25:37.970]  With your help, we gained 23 points with voters under the age of even 25. And some amazing remarks from Rob Schneider as well at the event.
[00:25:38.069 --> 00:25:39.150]  This is clip number 70. Watch.
[00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:52.430]  Democrats, you lost because you tried to convince the American people that it was racist-y to close the border and not let people come in illegally to rob and murder them.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.279]  You lost because nobody gives a f*** about the term Latinx.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:13.980]  You lost because your Justice Department called parents who showed up at school board meetings terrorists just for not wanting pornography in their children's classrooms.
[00:26:18.599 --> 00:26:34.180]  You lost Democrats, you lost because you lied about January 6th, calling it worse than Pearl Harbor or 9-11, instead of what January 6th really was, the FBI guided tour of the Capitol building.
[00:26:40.279 --> 00:26:54.220]  You lost, Democrats, because men can't have babies, women don't have dicks, even if they play in the WNBA. And free speech isn't a privilege like a driver's license.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.279]  It's a God-given right guaranteed by our Constitution.
[00:27:01.799 --> 00:27:08.619]  Folks, we're going to be breaking down more clips from this historic event on the other side of this short four-minute break beginning in about 25 seconds.

[00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:43.210]  And not that anyone was really concerned, but Trump did directly address claims that Elon Musk is president of Elon.
[00:27:43.369 --> 00:27:58.480]  We saw Adam Kinzinger, we saw Don Lemon, we saw other leftists refer to Elon Musk as president Elon, Brian Stelter, and others throughout the leftist Political media, the private political class, the compromised media.
[00:27:58.759 --> 00:28:10.559]  These are clips 89 and 80 back-to-back from Trump at the America Fest just the other day talking about the Department of Government efficiency as well as the fact that Elon Musk is not the president of the United States, folks.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.019]  Let's watch.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:18.619]  And we will create the new Department of Government efficiency headed by Elon Musk.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.640]  And no, he's not taking the presidency.
[00:28:31.319 --> 00:28:33.099]  I like having smart people.
[00:28:33.359 --> 00:28:35.279]  You know, they're on a new kick.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.539]  Russia, Russia, Russia.
[00:28:36.759 --> 00:28:37.980]  Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.
[00:28:38.299 --> 00:28:39.480]  All the different hoaxes.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:46.039]  And the new one is, President Trump has ceded the presidency to Elon Musk.
[00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:47.119]  No.
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.099]  No.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.400]  That's not happening.
[00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:55.390]  But Elon's done an amazing job.
[00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.750]  Isn't it nice to have smart people that we can rely on?
[00:28:59.089 --> 00:29:00.029]  Don't we want that?
[00:29:00.609 --> 00:29:01.650]  He's done a great job.
[00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:04.490]  Well, there you have it, folks.
[00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.309]  Elon Musk is not the President of the United States.
[00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:09.410]  Trump goes on to say that he can't even be the President of the United States because he's an immigrant.
[00:29:09.589 --> 00:29:13.609]  It's so funny how much the left loves immigrants unless they're Elon Musk.
[00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:17.450]  How much the left loves legal immigrants unless they're Elon Musk.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:33.779]  But all of this is in the context of the left's globalist institutions doing everything they can to undermine the integrity of every nation's sovereignty, all while trying to get us into World War III as soon as possible.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.279]  We've seen escalation after escalation.
[00:29:36.319 --> 00:29:37.380]  I'm going to get into all of the clips.
[00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:40.920]  We've seen lie after lie, but culturally now, they are losing.
[00:29:41.059 --> 00:29:42.819]  And the info war is never won or lost.
[00:29:42.819 --> 00:29:45.359]  You're either winning it or you're losing it.
[00:29:45.359 --> 00:29:56.259]  In fact, I'm working on a promo right now that goes through all of the world's most famous battles, going back to Thermopylae, through Waterloo, through Blitzkrieg, through today.
[00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.509]  And highlighting the fact that the info war has always been there.
[00:30:00.589 --> 00:30:03.369]  The information war has always been there.
[00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:16.009]  It's always been about lies in political establishments against the interests of their people, populism versus political classes, and then political shifts, power dynamics changing abruptly when the corruption finally comes to a head.
[00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:19.650]  But the information war has been waged ever since the fall of man.
[00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:24.269]  If you look back at Genesis, the first story of the Bible is the deceiving.
[00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:32.609]  The serpent deceiving Adam and Eve at the Tree of Knowledge, claiming that they will be like God if only they eat from the Tree of Knowledge.
[00:30:34.869 --> 00:30:40.369]  And through that deception began the information war, which is part of the human condition.
[00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:46.809]  It's married to the human condition and will perpetuate until good finally triumphs over evil one day.
[00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:47.990]  And I hope that day is soon.
[00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.009]  Quote, how much did you pay to have your daughter raped?
[00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:58.230]  Texas launches international billboard campaign to combat illegal migration.
[00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:11.349]  This is clip number 35. Texas has placed dozens of billboards throughout Central America and Mexico warning U.S.-bound migrants about dangers of the voyage and penalties they can expect to face if they illegally enter the Lone Star State.
[00:31:11.569 --> 00:31:16.829]  Let's watch clip number 35. I want to thank everybody for being out here today.
[00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:33.829]  I am joined today by General Seltzer, by the Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, Freeman Martin, by the Texas Border Czar, Mike Banks, by Rose Luna, she is the CEO of the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault,
[00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:36.910]  and also by Martine and Kimberly Wall.
[00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:38.630]  This is Kim Wall right here.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:45.119]  The walls are the owners of the property on which we gather today.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:54.180]  We gather in areas where they have burned down trees, like the ashes that we see here.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.799]  The ashes we see here are from trees they burned down.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:05.220]  Trees where migrant women were being sexually assaulted by coyotes, gangs, and human traffickers.
[00:32:05.559 --> 00:32:08.339]  They are known as rape trees.
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.339]  We're here to expose the truth.
[00:32:11.779 --> 00:32:15.599]  The truth to immigrants who are thinking about coming here.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:23.359]  The truth about the traffickers who assault so many of the women and children along the way.
[00:32:24.039 --> 00:32:30.140]  We are launching a new campaign to deter illegal immigration into Texas.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:37.859]  Yesterday we began putting up billboards, dozens of billboards, in Central America and in Mexico.
[00:32:38.799 --> 00:32:47.660]  They inform potential illegal immigrants about the reality of what will happen to them if they try to enter Texas illegally.
[00:32:48.319 --> 00:32:55.420]  These billboards, some of which you can see behind me, they tell the horror stories of human trafficking.
[00:32:56.119 --> 00:33:01.119]  One says many girls who try to migrate to Texas are kidnapped.
[00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:08.650]  Another sign says your wife and daughter Will pay for their trip with their bodies.
[00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:18.009]  One asked families thinking about sending their kids here, how much did you pay to have your daughter raped?
[00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:21.849]  This is tough medicine.
[00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:27.109]  But we want no more rape trees in Texas.
[00:33:27.849 --> 00:33:32.089]  Do not make the dangerous trek to Texas.
[00:33:35.739 --> 00:33:37.220]  Governor Abbott's absolutely right.
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.140]  I went down to Eagle Pass in February.
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.019]  Gosh, I can't believe it's been almost a year now since I've been there.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.500]  And I witnessed the horrors that are taking place at the border.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.500]  I know what it's like to be able to jump on one side or the other of the border wall because it's so easy to cross.
[00:33:51.759 --> 00:33:57.059]  I did it live on the air for the War Room with Owen Schroyer hosting, where I hopped on either side of the wall.
[00:33:58.089 --> 00:34:14.670]  I know what it's like at the border seeing trash bag after trash bag to the tune of hundreds filled with wet clothes, where the migrants swam over the Rio Grande, the freezing Rio Grande, took off their wet clothes, took dry clothes out of the trash bags, left their wet clothes behind and moved on.
[00:34:14.769 --> 00:34:22.130]  I know what it's like to look at pharmaceutical drugs, antibiotics littered across the border of the United States of America into Texas.
[00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:34.500]  I know what it's like to speak with Members of ICE and others responsible for guarding the border about the three-year-olds and the two-year-olds that they've pulled out of the water.
[00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:36.159]  Some of them too late.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.500]  Many of them not with their parents or guardians.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:54.400]  I know what it's like to talk to members of Border Patrol who have said for the first time in their entire career they are now seeing the same children being trafficked across the border multiple times.
[00:34:55.590 --> 00:35:03.349]  So they'll send a child across to see if the coast is clear, and then they'll cross over with their drugs or with the other people they're trying to smuggle into the United States.
[00:35:03.469 --> 00:35:07.929]  Then they'll send that child back and have them come over in a different location to test.
[00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:11.250]  And so these children are being captured multiple times.
[00:35:11.429 --> 00:35:13.530]  Greg Abbott's absolutely right that the trafficking is real.
[00:35:16.659 --> 00:35:18.380]  It's an incredibly dangerous thing.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:46.380]  Showing the world what a prosperous and peaceful and just civilization looks like and not condoning or funding or allowing any of these actions to take place in any nations that want to do business with the United States of America.
[00:35:48.639 --> 00:35:51.559]  But finally, we are winning the cultural war.
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:59.900]  Finally, we are seeing a push, even from Hollywood, even from some mainstream media Actors and talent winning.
[00:36:00.159 --> 00:36:03.880]  Major Hollywood actor says studio is more hungry for faith-based films than ever before.
[00:36:04.019 --> 00:36:19.380]  This is clip number 36. Actor Neil McDonough, who I remember most from the series Band of Brothers, joined the Glenn Beck program this week telling the conservative commentator about Hollywood's shift towards accepting Christian film scripts.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:27.000]  This is clip number 36. By going out and buying tickets to films like this, that's the message you're directly sending to Los Angeles.
[00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:28.519]  I love that.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.340]  Do you think they can learn?
[00:36:30.559 --> 00:36:38.280]  Because I've talked to enough people where they really don't understand it.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.059]  And it's not a malice thing or anything.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.039]  They can try to relate.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:42.840]  Noah.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:46.119]  And they have no idea why that doesn't connect.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.800]  Well, it's...
[00:36:50.610 --> 00:37:08.230]  I was reading they had the breakdown of all the studios of what they're looking for in this project and never ever ever have I seen before of the ten of them four or five of them in the bottom said oh by the way if you have something of faith we're very interested this year So something's changed,
[00:37:08.369 --> 00:37:16.829]  whether it's Angel Studios, whether it's the amazing Irwin Brothers, whether it's Dallas Jenkins, whether it's the Kendricks, whomever it is who's going out there on the limb and telling stories of faith.
[00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:26.190]  So the whole family can go to a theater together, grab popcorn, grab a soda, hang back, watch a movie for two hours, then after have a discussion with your eight-year-old or your 80-year-old.
[00:37:27.289 --> 00:37:35.789]  And the fact of the matter is this is happening because there is a major shift in the zeitgeist, a major shift in the spirit of the times where people are finally accepting Christ.
[00:37:35.969 --> 00:37:37.630]  They're accepting faith.
[00:37:37.769 --> 00:37:39.190]  They're realizing that God exists.
[00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:44.469]  And ultimately they're realizing that a world without God is not a world that's sustainable, I think.
[00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:50.289]  It's not even so much that people are embracing faith as it is that they're denying an anti-God sentiment.
[00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:56.139]  They're denying an atheistic approach, an atheistic philosophy, on the nature of the world.
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:38:11.519]  They understand that these globalists and these technocrats see themselves as gods and what that does is exasperate the disparity between the political class and the people, the working class, the American class, not just in the United States of America but throughout the world.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.780]  Axios chiefs sound the alarm.
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.800]  Citizen journalism controls flow of information.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.300]  I'm going to show you clip number nine here in a moment.
[00:38:18.639 --> 00:38:27.920]  The legacy media is under enormous pressure to remain the dominant source of news in politics and culture in the face of the growing influence of citizen journalism.
[00:38:28.199 --> 00:38:32.320]  Axios co-founders Jim VandeHei and Mike Allen claimed on Friday.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.119]  Let's watch what they had to say in clip number nine.
[00:38:36.059 --> 00:38:36.539]  Matters.
[00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:39.730]  Everything we do is under fire.
[00:38:40.449 --> 00:38:45.789]  Elon Musk sits on Twitter every day or X today saying like, we are the media.
[00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:47.090]  You are the media.
[00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:50.730]  My message to Elon Musk is bulls**t.
[00:38:50.769 --> 00:38:51.969]  You're not the media.
[00:38:52.369 --> 00:38:53.590]  You having...
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:05.500]  You having a blue check mark, a Twitter handle, and 300 words of cleverness doesn't make you a reporter.
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:13.079]  Any more than me looking at your head and seeing that you have a brain and telling you you have an awesome set of tools makes me a damn neurosurgeon, right?
[00:39:13.219 --> 00:39:24.599]  Like, what we do, what journalists do, what you did in Mississippi, what Al Jazeera does in the Middle East, you don't proclaim yourself to be a reporter?
[00:39:25.789 --> 00:39:26.889]  Like, that's nonsense.
[00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:29.210]  Like, being a reporter is hard.
[00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:30.710]  Really hard.
[00:39:31.929 --> 00:39:33.250]  You have to care.
[00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:35.590]  You have to do the hard work.
[00:39:35.929 --> 00:39:43.349]  You have to skid up every single day and say, I want to get to the closest approximation of the truth without any fear, without any favoritism.
[00:39:43.889 --> 00:39:46.469]  You don't do that by popping off on Twitter.
[00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:49.090]  You don't do that by having an opinion.
[00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:52.469]  You do it by doing the hard work.
[00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:54.530]  Yeah, come on.
[00:39:54.650 --> 00:40:00.750]  First of all, I've got to say, extraordinary content.
[00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:02.929]  It needed to be said.
[00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:05.369]  It continues to need to be said.
[00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:21.690]  When all of the garbage is flying around on social media, lying about reporters, lying about the hard work they do, lying about the hard work editors do, lying about everything up and down about not only their alternative set of facts,
[00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:28.710]  Oh, the National Press Club honors Van de High and Allen.
[00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:34.429]  The National Press Club engages in a ceremony where they pat each other on the back.
[00:40:34.869 --> 00:40:35.989]  And you know what?
[00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:43.429]  If journalism was as these leaders of so-called journalism described it, then maybe there would be an argument there.
[00:40:44.219 --> 00:41:01.380]  Maybe if journalists actually did the hard work of journalism, did some investigative reporting and reported accurately on it, people would have more faith in the journalistic process or these mainstream media outlets, these legacy members of the private political press.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:11.900]  Maybe if they actually fact-checked what they were saying instead of lying and lying about vaccines and Russian hoaxes and collusions and impeachments and crimes, maybe people would actually believe them.
[00:41:12.949 --> 00:41:22.289]  Maybe if they didn't do things like change the way Joe Rogan looks in a video as he talks about ivermectin so that he looks sickly and gaunt, maybe people would actually believe them.
[00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:31.269]  Maybe if the mainstream media hadn't lied incessantly for years about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq causing the invasion of Iraq for no reason other than political gain.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.679]  Well then maybe the people would actually believe them.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:48.699]  The fact of the matter is, people trust Elon Musk and independent journalists on X not because these independent journalists are so good at lying or because Elon Musk has undue influence.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:54.000]  He has influence because he operates with the currency of leadership, which is trust.
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.699]  It's not because he has money that people trust him.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:57.820]  Bloomberg has money.
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:41:59.719]  People don't trust Bloomberg.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:05.300]  There are all sorts of billionaires throughout the world who have money that people don't trust, the Bezos's and the Mark Zuckerberg's.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.559]  Zuckerberg has a bigger platform than Elon Musk.
[00:42:08.719 --> 00:42:35.679]  He's got Facebook and Instagram, both of which boast larger user bases than X. We're good to go.
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:43.320]  So it has nothing to do with Elon Musk being so rich that he's able to buy influence.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:54.099]  He's rich because people support him and believe in his products and his services, whether it's Tesla, whether it's SpaceX, whether it's X itself, or whether it's others, and people trust him because he's not a liar.
[00:42:55.119 --> 00:43:04.000]  I mean, let's ask the leftists in the audience, what is a single thing that Elon Musk has blatantly lied about in the last 10 years?
[00:43:04.639 --> 00:43:07.800]  I'm not talking about something he's gotten wrong, because we can find anything...
[00:43:09.519 --> 00:43:12.519]  Of anyone, we can find something that someone has gotten wrong over the years.
[00:43:12.559 --> 00:43:15.760]  If you look at all my broadcasts throughout the past, you're going to find stuff that I got wrong.
[00:43:16.159 --> 00:43:19.699]  If you look at Alex Jones' broadcasts throughout the last 30 years, eventually you're going to find something that he got wrong.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.199]  That is just part of the human condition.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.599]  There's no way that any one person can be right all the time.
[00:43:23.699 --> 00:43:27.039]  But what is something that Elon Musk lied about?
[00:43:27.239 --> 00:43:36.920]  I have yet to see from the left any accurate reporting with receipts on something that Elon Musk has blatantly and explicitly lied about.
[00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:52.829]  But I can find all sorts of examples of things ABC News has lied about, or CNN has lied about, or the New York Times has lied about, or the Wall Street Journal has lied about, or any of these networks who have been forced to apologize and read legal statements like The View had to do three, I think, in one week.
[00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:59.969]  We've seen the defamation lawsuits where $15 million was paid out to Donald Trump because of the lies from Stenophilus and others.
[00:44:01.489 --> 00:44:07.210]  Joy Reid is as much a liar as Forrest Gump is retarded.
[00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:11.449]  That's why nobody trusts them.
[00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:12.530]  They don't actually do journalism.
[00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:22.869]  They're obviously hacks who are reporting a narrative that is backed by the intelligence community, backed by the deep state, and they only care to bolster up the desires of what their editors see.
[00:44:24.409 --> 00:44:29.909]  Jeff Bezos didn't buy the Washington Post that he could ensure that there was more accurate reporting from the Washington Post.
[00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:43.539]  He bought up the Washington Post so that he could have some investment in mainstream media outlets that would Bolster up his stock values at Amazon that would help this globalist agenda that he felt married to during the Biden administration and he was married to it.
[00:44:44.239 --> 00:44:46.400]  Same with the Obama administration as well.
[00:44:46.719 --> 00:45:00.460]  Jeff Bezos' business depends on trade with China being as cheap as possible because so many of all of the sellers on Amazon that sell you the products that you order depend on manufacturing and sourcing in China.
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:05.760]  And if there are tariffs on China coming into the United States of America, that's going to be incredibly harmful for Jeff Bezos' business.
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:12.780]  So maybe the reason he bought the Washington Post is not because he cares so much about the freedom of the press, but because he wants to ensure that...
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:21.460]  Whatever political agenda is in place in the United States of America is conducive to cheap trade with China so that his company share values go up as much as possible.
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:23.739]  Which one do you think is more likely?
[00:45:24.739 --> 00:45:26.239]  Have you ever thought of that?
[00:45:28.239 --> 00:45:35.639]  So while they pat each other on the back at these press club things, and you got to keep in mind, nobody's ever heard of Van de High or Allen.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.139]  Nobody's ever really heard about the press club.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.179]  Except for people within the press industry.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:44.099]  This is an insulated industry.
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.059]  It's a club that you are not a part of.
[00:45:46.139 --> 00:45:48.519]  Just like George Carlin said, it's a big club and you're not in it.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:56.059]  That has conspired together for at least 50 years, at least since the Red Scare, to lie to you on behalf of the deep state every step of the way.
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:05.619]  And its lies are part of the reason that we've had things like war after war, draft after draft, conflict after conflict, invasion after invasion.
[00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:11.510]  Corruption after corruption, false claims of rape after false claims of rape, you name it.
[00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:21.349]  Every lie that has been widely believed on a critical way, on a critical level throughout the United States is because these so-called journalists doing the hard work that they do have lied.
[00:46:21.429 --> 00:46:23.170]  And now they've done some great things, don't get me wrong.
[00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:26.630]  The Watergate reporting was very strong.
[00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:30.489]  The reporting on Edward Snowden was very strong.
[00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:39.050]  Releasing what really happened there, what he really found when he was working in the depths of the deep state.
[00:46:39.769 --> 00:46:50.750]  Every once in a while, there are these establishment journalists who do some great reporting, but man, do they lie in a major way nine times out of every ten times they report on any given issue.
[00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:53.730]  And that's why the people don't trust them anymore.
[00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:58.829]  They had a monopoly on information for the last 50 years, and they still were not able to save their reputation.
[00:47:00.199 --> 00:47:02.579]  Because they lied so much and they blame Elon Musk?
[00:47:03.219 --> 00:47:21.769]  How can the institutions that have had a monopoly on information in the United States for half of a century blame anyone but themselves when the vast majority of people in the United States of America just no longer buy their BS? And the same goes for the Democrats who are basically One entity with the private political press.
[00:47:21.869 --> 00:47:28.309]  Kamala campaign adviser quits Democrat Party saying, I don't want to be part of the craziness like leaving a cult.
[00:47:28.469 --> 00:47:29.349]  Clip number eight here.
[00:47:29.449 --> 00:47:37.889]  Kamala Harris campaign adviser Lindy Lee announced she's leaving the Democratic Party over its continuing shift toward woke radicalism and intolerance of dissenting viewpoints.
[00:47:37.969 --> 00:47:38.730]  This is clip number eight.
[00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:45.110]  She sort of personifies now, goes to Christmas past, as does Biden.
[00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:48.210]  The Democrats have got to move on quickly, haven't they?
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.579]  Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[00:47:50.699 --> 00:47:59.800]  She's indulging delusions of running for governor in California in 2026 and perhaps even running for president in 2020. And I just want to echo what a lot of you guys already said.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.179]  This past week has been harrowing for me.
[00:48:02.659 --> 00:48:08.599]  This Saturday, I went on Fox& Friends and I said that Democrats have a stench of loser hanging over them.
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:13.159]  As soon as I said that, there were boycott campaigns against me.
[00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:14.940]  Unblock, unfollow campaigns.
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.000]  I lost 40,000 followers.
[00:48:17.119 --> 00:48:17.380]  Really?
[00:48:17.679 --> 00:48:18.579]  In four days.
[00:48:19.019 --> 00:48:21.199]  People have called me the W-word.
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.260]  I don't know what we're allowed to say, but you can fill in the blank.
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:23.880]  We're uncensored.
[00:48:24.099 --> 00:48:25.000]  Say it.
[00:48:25.159 --> 00:48:26.059]  Say what the word was.
[00:48:26.139 --> 00:48:26.760]  Am I allowed to?
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:27.039]  Yeah.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:29.659]  Apparently, I'm a...
[00:48:29.659 --> 00:48:31.059]  Well, they called me a whore.
[00:48:31.159 --> 00:48:32.320]  They called me the C-word.
[00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:34.610]  They asked for me to be deported.
[00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:39.630]  And you can just search for my name in those terms on X and you'll see a bunch of them.
[00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:46.170]  So, you know, all these so-called Democrats, the party of inclusion, the party of diversity, masks off.
[00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:51.289]  And it's even worse because they pretend to occupy the moral high ground.
[00:48:51.489 --> 00:48:54.289]  At least with Republicans, you know, they are who they are.
[00:48:54.469 --> 00:48:59.590]  But with Democrats, they pretend to be, you know, so loving and caring and embracing of diversity.
[00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:08.449]  But all of a sudden, when I dare to utter any criticisms of the goddess Kamala Harris, I get ostracized.
[00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:12.090]  Me, after having raised tens of millions of dollars for the party.
[00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:20.969]  And I'm being called a grifter when all along, all these years, I've said on TV, I've said to the press, I'm a conservative Democrat.
[00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:23.050]  This is not a switch for me.
[00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:24.130]  This is just me.
[00:49:24.269 --> 00:49:26.050]  This is who I've always been.
[00:49:26.269 --> 00:49:28.869]  And also, my donors are pissed.
[00:49:29.559 --> 00:49:33.900]  They raised $2.5 billion across Super PAC in the campaign.
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.159]  It's my responsibility.
[00:49:35.539 --> 00:49:39.260]  It's my duty of care to ask, what the hell happened with that money?
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.820]  Why did we spend it?
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.780]  Why did we spend millions of dollars on five-star hotels for campaign staffers?
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:52.719]  Why did we spend $500,000 essentially bribing Al Sharpton moments before he interviewed Kamala?
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:57.880]  These are legitimate questions, but no, in the cult, you can't ask questions.
[00:49:58.329 --> 00:50:04.210]  And leaving the Democratic Party or even questioning the Democratic Party is like leaving a cult.
[00:50:04.449 --> 00:50:05.429]  It's terrifying.
[00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:07.349]  Yeah, Dave Rubin.
[00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:37.349]  The more dangerous they become as well.
[00:50:37.469 --> 00:50:39.230]  And they are lashing out in abundance.
[00:50:39.409 --> 00:50:40.110]  They're trying to silence.
[00:50:40.269 --> 00:50:41.349]  They're trying to censor.
[00:50:41.489 --> 00:50:49.369]  They're trying to bolster up the censorship industrial complex, which we saw from this omnibus bill that, thank God, failed just a couple of days ago in the halls of Congress.
[00:50:49.809 --> 00:50:53.190]  They're coming after Alex Jones, and they're coming after Infowars in an unprecedented way.
[00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:56.530]  I know that Alex was on the phone with lawyers most of the day today.
[00:50:56.809 --> 00:51:01.869]  He's constantly battling, trying to find ways to fight back against this machine that is against us.
[00:51:02.559 --> 00:51:06.340]  We're good to go.
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:13.579]  We're good to go.
[00:51:13.579 --> 00:51:17.800]  We're good to go.
[00:51:35.089 --> 00:51:37.989]  We're good to go.
[00:51:55.639 --> 00:52:00.320]  You said that you were on vacation and now you're moving this small child to the airport.
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.480]  I thought you were on vacation.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:04.980]  Ma'am, I thought you were on vacation.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.440]  What happened to that?
[00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:12.880]  Do you have any comment about children that have gone missing that you've helped to escort across the country?
[00:52:13.539 --> 00:52:15.300]  Wait a minute, is this MDM? No.
[00:52:16.179 --> 00:52:17.159]  We have footage here.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.579]  That a lot of these children don't know the sponsors that they are going to.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:22.699]  What's going on?
[00:52:23.139 --> 00:52:24.179]  There's kids in the car here.
[00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:25.719]  They're moving these kids.
[00:52:26.059 --> 00:52:27.099]  They just turn the lights off.
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:29.860]  This is the MVM headquarters that we are currently at.
[00:52:30.039 --> 00:52:32.300]  There are kids in this van right here that they are moving.
[00:52:33.079 --> 00:52:34.159]  There's somebody that's going to come out.
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:34.960]  Let's see what they have to say.
[00:52:35.679 --> 00:52:36.820]  Hey, are you a manager here?
[00:52:38.219 --> 00:52:43.800]  Hey, we have spoken to some of these children and they tell us that they don't know a lot of times the sponsors that they're going to.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.280]  Do you have any comment on that at all?
[00:52:46.519 --> 00:52:47.659]  This is MBM, correct?
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.019]  I'm not sure.
[00:52:49.159 --> 00:52:49.739]  You're not sure.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:51.639]  Excuse me.
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:53.159]  What's going on here?
[00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:56.659]  There they go.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:01.579]  And notice, they got out of here in such a hurry that they just left their bags here.
[00:53:02.909 --> 00:53:03.449]  Think about that.
[00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:04.050]  They got out of here.
[00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:05.230]  We don't even know what's in those bags.
[00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:10.929]  They just left them there and they took off in the van in such a hurry because that's how secret this operation is.
[00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:12.929]  They do not want you to know what is going on.
[00:53:13.409 --> 00:53:15.489]  That van that we just confronted, they are now taking off.
[00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:16.449]  We are following them.
[00:53:16.769 --> 00:53:18.690]  We believe that they're taking these kids to the airport.
[00:53:18.969 --> 00:53:26.150]  We have talked to some of these children that you guys escort and some of these children have told us that their friends don't know the sponsors that they're going to.
[00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:27.590]  Are you okay with that?
[00:53:28.969 --> 00:53:30.630]  Sydney, why are you all wearing masks?
[00:53:30.809 --> 00:53:31.750]  Do you have any comment on that?
[00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:33.250]  Why are you hiding your identity?
[00:53:33.769 --> 00:53:35.150]  Do you have any shame, sir?
[00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:39.190]  There's still time to redeem yourself.
[00:53:39.309 --> 00:53:42.309]  Would you like to see the footage that we caught of the room and what's going on?
[00:53:48.329 --> 00:53:50.309]  Were their IDs even checked just there?
[00:53:50.829 --> 00:53:52.369]  Were their IDs even just checked?
[00:53:52.809 --> 00:53:53.690]  Who checked their IDs?
[00:53:53.969 --> 00:53:55.369]  I didn't see any ID checked just there.
[00:53:57.110 --> 00:53:58.130]  There was no ID checked.
[00:53:59.539 --> 00:54:00.599]  Why weren't there IDs checked?
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:01.559]  If I was going to go here...
[00:54:01.559 --> 00:54:02.360]  I can't talk to you.
[00:54:03.199 --> 00:54:06.099]  Why do you guys ID American citizens?
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:06.719]  Why do you guys ID American citizens?
[00:54:06.719 --> 00:54:07.840]  Why do you guys ID American citizens?
[00:54:08.059 --> 00:54:11.239]  Why do you guys ID American citizens?
[00:54:11.239 --> 00:54:14.579]  Are a lot of the kids coming over here, are they trafficked?
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:20.679]  Does that happen a lot, that the kids come over here with a totally fake name?
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:20.760]  Yeah.
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:23.880]  There's no way for us to verify.
[00:54:24.559 --> 00:54:26.880]  And so they come over here with a fake name and then they just come up with one.
[00:54:27.019 --> 00:54:28.079]  They just get a brand new identity.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.019]  They could be anybody.
[00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:32.449]  Have you seen that movie, uh...
[00:54:32.449 --> 00:54:32.989]  Sound of Freedom?
[00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:33.750]  Yeah, Sound of Freedom.
[00:54:33.769 --> 00:54:34.389]  Yeah, I've seen that.
[00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:35.090]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:54:35.329 --> 00:54:35.849]  Exactly, Jake.
[00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:41.030]  You guys get the kids coming over here with the notes that are attached to them with the addresses, right?
[00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:44.710]  And a lot of times those addresses lead to, like, a sex trafficker or something, right?
[00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.730]  That's legit.
[00:54:46.829 --> 00:54:48.250]  There's a lot of that we can't tell.
[00:54:48.469 --> 00:54:49.210]  What's the issue, though?
[00:54:49.289 --> 00:54:50.269]  Why can't you guys talk on camera?
[00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:53.570]  It's the policies that we have.
[00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:55.090]  Things that we can and can't say.
[00:54:55.369 --> 00:54:56.869]  But why don't they want you talking on camera?
[00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:58.070]  Politics.
[00:54:58.889 --> 00:54:59.329]  Politics.
[00:54:59.849 --> 00:55:01.710]  What, like making the administration look bad?
[00:55:01.869 --> 00:55:02.050]  Yeah.
[00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:03.409]  Damn.
[00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:07.570]  Honestly, I really wish there was more people like you.
[00:55:07.929 --> 00:55:08.090]  Yeah.
[00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:09.090]  Exposing this ****.
[00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:09.309]  Yeah.
[00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:11.550]  Because it sucks.
[00:55:11.909 --> 00:55:13.469]  It truly is a horrible thing.
[00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:13.949]  Yeah.
[00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:15.090]  It is a horrible thing.
[00:55:16.289 --> 00:55:17.969]  But me, I can't do that.
[00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:19.329]  You could blow the whistle on it.
[00:55:19.429 --> 00:55:19.929]  No, I can't.
[00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:21.349]  You could, but you're going to lose your job.
[00:55:21.469 --> 00:55:22.190]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:22.429 --> 00:55:26.250]  You work for MVM, and MVM is an organization that has moved thousands.
[00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:29.530]  I don't work for MVM. You do not work for MVM? I'm on location.
[00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:41.610]  We've now landed in Houston, and it appears as if MVM has requested a police escort because they don't want media exposing what they're doing.
[00:55:44.409 --> 00:55:49.369]  But if you look, They have all of the kids wearing masks and they have them keeping their head down.
[00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:53.409]  All the kids wearing masks keeping their head down.
[00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:58.250]  They're telling them to hide their face.
[00:55:58.829 --> 00:56:00.150]  Many of these kids go missing.
[00:56:00.909 --> 00:56:05.590]  You said that you were on vacation and now you're moving this small child to the airport.
[00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:06.650]  I thought you were on vacation.
[00:56:08.699 --> 00:56:10.139]  Ma'am, I thought you were on vacation.
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:11.440]  Unbelievable reporting here.
[00:56:12.099 --> 00:56:14.440]  Capturing the human trafficking happening right on air.
[00:56:14.579 --> 00:56:16.340]  We've got members of ICE, Border Patrol.
[00:56:17.409 --> 00:56:20.030]  Saying that they wish there were more reporters like this reporter.
[00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:23.849]  We've got members of the CIA escorting children to unknown addresses.
[00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:29.530]  It's happening right before our eyes and they're not even allowed to talk about it on camera because they want to save face.
[00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:36.769]  They don't want to embarrass the current administration for doing exactly that which it has been involved in doing which is human trafficking.
[00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:47.539]  We've got a groundbreaking report On the other side of this one minute break from Alex Jones himself on the latest developments of the up to 80 injured or dead as driver plows into German Christmas market right on the other side.
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:48.199]  Stay tuned.
[00:56:55.929 --> 00:57:05.329]  Alright, there is a lot to unpack here, but as you know on Friday there was a car attack at another Christmas celebration in Germany.
[00:57:05.449 --> 00:57:07.030]  They have to put up these barriers all over Europe.
[00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:11.969]  They call them freedom cones to stop the Islamic invaders from engaging in mass murder.
[00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:31.369]  But now we learn, this was a special leftist from Saudi Arabia, that the British government and others, the BBC, were helping promote the smuggling of women out of the Middle East into Europe, and he had a bunch of extradition charges on him for all sorts of crimes,
[00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:37.710]  but the German government was protecting him from extradition.
[00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:48.469]  This man was an immigrant who was supposed to be extradited upon request from the Saudi Arabian government itself, but the German government refused to do so.
[00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:51.730]  And now he's killed and maimed all these people.
[00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:55.909]  He'll probably spend a few years on a lunatic asylum and be right back out doing it.
[00:57:56.530 --> 00:58:12.119]  And then meanwhile, Elon Musk is being attacked for saying that the German government is absolutely negligent in this and so many other insane developments that are unfolding where the illegal aliens, they're called migrants,
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:17.320]  commit the majority of crimes in Europe and in Germany despite the fact they're less than 10%.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:20.019]  So we're gonna break it all down right now.
[00:58:26.619 --> 00:58:33.989]  As you all know on Friday evening in Germany at an outdoor Christmas festival.
[00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:52.769]  Hundreds of people were targeted by a psychotic migrant from Saudi Arabia who rode over a whole bunch of them, wounding dozens and dozens and numbers varying, killing between four and eight people.
[00:58:52.909 --> 00:58:53.630]  I've seen different numbers.
[00:58:53.949 --> 00:58:56.190]  Well now it's been close to 48 hours.
[00:58:56.349 --> 00:58:56.989]  It's Sunday evening.
[00:58:57.690 --> 00:59:01.130]  And we've gotten basically all the details of who the guy is.
[00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:20.329]  And wow, you talk about a poster boy for the psychotic left, but at the same time it shows why the left and radical Islam are so allied, even though their supposed worldviews are so different.
[00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:36.190]  Like they'll stone a gay person, but at the same time Both a leftist and an Islamist radical will plow their car over Christian revelers,
[00:59:36.469 --> 00:59:38.349]  particularly because they're white and European.
[00:59:38.489 --> 00:59:39.349]  I mean, that's the main reason.
[00:59:39.469 --> 00:59:44.690]  But folks having fun and Christmas trees and caroling, I mean, that makes these crutches go crazy.
[00:59:44.969 --> 00:59:56.150]  So now we've learned the details of this guy, how he was a BBC poster child, how they helped him promote and recruit and smuggle women Out of Saudi Arabia and more.
[00:59:56.289 --> 01:00:00.989]  This is how the media tried to cover it up again and say that a truck, a car attacked people.
[01:00:01.090 --> 01:00:01.989]  The same thing they always do.
[01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:04.650]  I mean, this is just totally sick.
[01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:05.710]  Breaking news.
[01:00:05.909 --> 01:00:06.489]  A car.
[01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:07.130]  A car.
[01:00:07.269 --> 01:00:07.989]  A car.
[01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:11.710]  Has plowed into a crowded Christmas market here in Germany.
[01:00:11.969 --> 01:00:18.250]  Regional government officials say it was probably an attack, but have not given further details.
[01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:32.780]  Now this is an incredibly tragic event obviously but we've seen this hundreds of times across Europe and many times the United States where an Islamist is crazy targets A Christmas event.
[01:00:33.079 --> 01:00:36.480]  It's like flies to, you know what, they just come.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:44.300]  But in this case, we were told now, he is from Saudi Arabia, but he's not an Islamic extremist, so let's just get that clear, and it was the vehicle that did it.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:01:06.449]  Then we learned he was the poster boy on BBC reports, you name it, of a loving liberal, by the way, pro-Israel, pro-Zionist, strangely enough, guy who Would help get women out of Saudi Arabia and its oppression and get them to the West.
[01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:16.530]  And we'll play a clip of him from a BBC News promotion and his website that mainly helps get young women out of the Middle East.
[01:01:16.809 --> 01:01:26.369]  And that some of these young women had gone public warning people in the last year that he'd smuggled into Europe, that he was basically an abuser, obvious.
[01:01:30.509 --> 01:01:33.050]  We're good to go.
[01:01:35.269 --> 01:01:35.949]  We're good to go.
[01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:41.650]  This is just so whacked out.
[01:01:41.769 --> 01:01:44.269]  These people are completely scrambled in the head.
[01:01:44.449 --> 01:01:51.469]  He's acting just like an Al-Qaeda person was, but he's anti-Islam, but he still targets evil white Christians.
[01:01:51.869 --> 01:01:56.269]  And that's why the left is also allied with them because they see it as anti-Western, anti-Christian.
[01:01:56.550 --> 01:02:01.050]  So this is a very, very sick, evil coalition, and it's very, very dangerous.
[01:02:01.449 --> 01:02:03.289]  Here's the BBC report I was talking about.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.059]  I'm from Saudi Arabia.
[01:02:05.219 --> 01:02:05.820]  I'm an activist.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:15.719]  I created a website to help people seeking asylum, especially from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region.
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:26.610]  Ninety percent of people who approach me We are women between 18 and 30 years old.
[01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:34.289]  When Europeans are asked in major polls, it's the same France, Germany, Sweden, you name it, what are you most angry about?
[01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:40.230]  And it's the high energy prices because of all the, quote, environmental laws, the carbon restrictions.
[01:02:40.409 --> 01:02:42.389]  But number two, it's the migrant crime.
[01:02:43.039 --> 01:02:49.860]  And depending on the country, they're between 10 and 15 times more likely to commit crime than the indigenous population.
[01:02:50.239 --> 01:02:53.820]  Translated, they commit way more crime per capita than anybody else.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:03:02.599]  And then you've got the corporate media every time these people run over a bunch of innocent revelers trying to cover it up and saying that the car did it.
[01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:13.010]  And then you've got Germany refusing to extradite this person and then every day I see articles that are just totally and absolutely insane.
[01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:25.309]  One just came out last week where a woman was raped brutally by one of these illegal alien invaders in Germany and then she criticized the person so she got a longer prison sentence than he did for her speech.
[01:03:26.099 --> 01:03:29.260]  So you have all these globalist parties that are anti-free speech.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:32.219]  They're openly trying to control speech in the United States.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.480]  They've been filing all sorts of cases against Elon Musk and others.
[01:03:35.699 --> 01:03:39.440]  They've been filing criminal charges on Americans and others that say things they don't like.
[01:03:39.679 --> 01:03:44.099]  They've extradited Americans and Canadians and others that deny the Holocaust.
[01:03:44.539 --> 01:03:47.880]  And whether you agree with that or not, people still have a right to say that.
[01:03:48.039 --> 01:03:51.199]  So they've got their long arm trying to come in and control us.
[01:03:51.820 --> 01:04:01.239]  And then Elon Musk says that the German government's out of control and that we need, you know, a new populist party, AFD, to win, which they're very close to doing in an election in a few weeks.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.320]  And they call that election meddling to point out that there's tyranny in Europe.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:09.780]  And if Germany gets reformed, the rest of the EU will get reformed.
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:19.039]  All that matters in the end is that he would not have been here if the AFD could have prevented the attack.
[01:04:20.039 --> 01:04:37.820]  If the establishment parties listened to the democratic wishes of the people and didn't constantly try to overrule the AFD. And that's why, Germany, you can only make one decision unless you're completely suicidal.
[01:04:38.539 --> 01:04:46.880]  This election, vote for the AFD if you want any hope for the future of this country.
[01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:49.829]  So this affects everybody.
[01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:52.849]  And tyranny in Europe is tyranny in America.
[01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:55.510]  It's the same globalists around the world doing this.
[01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:58.150]  So we need a global response to it.
[01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:01.289]  And only President Trump and Elon Musk are doing that on a mass level.
[01:05:01.489 --> 01:05:03.610]  We've been doing it for decades, spotlighting it.
[01:05:03.809 --> 01:05:06.170]  Now there's a global awakening and it's extremely exciting.
[01:05:06.329 --> 01:05:08.190]  So the listeners and viewers, great job.
[01:05:08.349 --> 01:05:09.309]  You are the tip of the spear.
[01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:11.409]  You're the reason that there's such a huge awakening.
[01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:14.670]  I salute you all and I salute Elon Musk as well.
[01:05:14.929 --> 01:05:15.769]  Thank you so much.
[01:05:15.969 --> 01:05:21.469]  Back to the live transmission with Chase Geyser hosting this live Sunday night broadcast.
[01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:25.010]  Now share this report like your future depends on it because it does.
[01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:25.929]  And we're winning.
[01:05:26.110 --> 01:05:26.949]  We've turned the tide.
[01:05:27.389 --> 01:05:29.969]  Now it's time to fight through the objective and win.
[01:05:31.389 --> 01:05:33.170]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's Alex Jones.
[01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:37.030]  I am Chase Geyser, your host, for the next two hours and 45 minutes.
[01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:39.590]  It's an honor and a pleasure to be here.
[01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:42.889]  And Alex Jones is absolutely right in his analysis of what's going on.
[01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:48.769]  We know that when you allow people into your country who do not assimilate with your culture, then it creates friction.
[01:05:48.949 --> 01:05:49.909]  It creates crime.
[01:05:50.090 --> 01:05:52.550]  We've had the same thing happen here in the United States of America.
[01:05:52.909 --> 01:06:05.409]  And one thing that I noticed this week that was particularly interesting about this is in clip number 93, right when this news was breaking of this Christmas attack, CNN was saying that this could be a right-wing extremist.
[01:06:05.550 --> 01:06:06.429]  Clip number 93 right here.
[01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:08.329]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[01:06:08.489 --> 01:06:11.130]  I just wanted to add to that quickly.
[01:06:11.570 --> 01:06:19.090]  Because we don't know, it's just worth saying, because we didn't cover it in the opening, Germany's government did collapse a few days ago.
[01:06:19.469 --> 01:06:31.769]  They have heightened, let's just say, energy in the political space in Germany right now, including the potential that you would have right-wing elements as well as left-wing.
[01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:40.349]  So I just wanted to add that to Josh's correct litany that you're looking at both the foreign, but also this wasn't a normal week in German politics.
[01:06:40.889 --> 01:07:03.590]  And while this has been going on, we've seen report after report after report in the last several weeks of German authorities approaching miscellaneous, seemingly random white women in public and confiscating their pocket knives, which they have been carrying to defend themselves against things like rape or attacks in their country because it's simply not as safe as it should be or it's not safe anymore.
[01:07:03.590 --> 01:07:07.949]  This is clip number 31 here of German police approaching women and confiscating their pocket knives.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.460]  Up to 80 injured.
[01:07:20.639 --> 01:07:22.039]  This is the aftermath of the Christmas attack.
[01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:26.639]  Coming up is clip 32 right after this, which shows the confiscation happening.
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:28.400]  So these terrorist attacks are fine.
[01:07:28.639 --> 01:07:33.880]  And if you get raped in Germany, then yes, there'll be prosecution for the rapist.
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:38.099]  But if you speak out against the rapist, then there's an even bigger problem for you.
[01:07:38.199 --> 01:07:43.019]  So here are the police walking up to elderly people and women in Germany, taking their knives.
[01:07:44.119 --> 01:07:44.699]  You have nothing.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:45.639]  Do you have anything on you?
[01:07:45.699 --> 01:07:46.719]  Oh, she says, not that I know of.
[01:07:47.039 --> 01:07:47.900]  Okay, I might have a knife somewhere.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:48.619]  Look at that side.
[01:07:49.219 --> 01:07:49.900]  On the side.
[01:07:50.059 --> 01:07:51.739]  So the police are just going through her purse.
[01:07:52.519 --> 01:07:53.500]  There's subtitles, of course.
[01:07:53.579 --> 01:07:54.119]  It's in German.
[01:07:54.579 --> 01:07:56.340]  And they're pulling out pocket knives.
[01:07:56.519 --> 01:08:08.659]  So I guess the people who are walking around with pocket knives as the last bastion of hope to defend themselves against attacks are the ones that are a threat to peace and safety in Germany.
[01:08:11.309 --> 01:08:12.969]  Not the migrant crisis.
[01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:14.889]  So protecting the borders doesn't matter at all.
[01:08:14.989 --> 01:08:21.850]  As long as we enforce these antiquated leftist kind of woke policies, it's globalism is what it is.
[01:08:21.909 --> 01:08:34.489]  When these organizations, when these nations join organizations like the UN or NATO or the World Economic Forum in any meaningful way, They always have to sacrifice the interests of their own constituents for the interests of the globalist political class.
[01:08:34.649 --> 01:08:40.409]  That's why the United States has been taken advantage of relentlessly over the course of the last decades in these organizations.
[01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:49.829]  It's why we elect Donald Trump to come and say look, we're not going to fund 25% of all the defense in Europe anymore if you're not going to pay your fair share into these organizations.
[01:08:51.539 --> 01:08:56.739]  But a strange, convenient narrative emerges in horrific market attack, Christmas market attack.
[01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:59.180]  These are clips of number 19 and 20 back-to-back.
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:09.020]  It's a twist that is incredibly convenient for the current failing progressive government in Germany as they face a severe political backlash for their open border immigration policies and a rising tide of populism.
[01:09:09.239 --> 01:09:18.510]  Primary suspect in the Christmas market terror attacks in Magdeburg, Doctor and refugee from Saudi Arabia is allegedly also supporter of the right-wing AFD party.
[01:09:18.729 --> 01:09:19.529]  Yeah, maybe.
[01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:23.010]  Tommy Robinson, Elon Musk, and Alex Jones, according to authorities.
[01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:27.409]  But it doesn't seem very right-wing to me to attack a Christmas market.
[01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:35.710]  It doesn't seem very Elon Musk-esque or Tommy Robinson-esque or Alex Jones-esque to attack a Christmas market or any market for that matter.
[01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:37.970]  This is clip 19 and 20 back-to-back.
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:42.359]  Daisley published an article in The Guardian calling for my arrest.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.520]  Yes, me.
[01:09:43.699 --> 01:09:44.399]  Elon Musk.
[01:09:44.619 --> 01:09:49.840]  In that article, he pointed to Germany as a model for media censorship and suggested that Britain should follow suit.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.180]  Let me start by quoting what Daisley wrote in The Guardian.
[01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:56.399]  Um, Ofcom should have the right to demand certain voices, like Tommy Robinson's.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:57.680]  Are de-platformed.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:03.579]  Anyone who doubts the practicality of this should take a look at social media in Germany, where platforms are significantly more accountable.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.520]  In Germany, illegal Nazi content is routinely removed within minutes of it being reported.
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:12.079]  Let's take a closer look at what's actually being censored in Germany.
[01:10:12.239 --> 01:10:16.600]  Before diving into the real stuff, though, I want to make sure you know that I'm not the real Elon Musk.
[01:10:16.699 --> 01:10:20.579]  I'm just an AI avatar and voice created by Dr. Taleb al-Abdul Mohsen.
[01:10:20.779 --> 01:10:23.720]  He's the real narrator here, and he's the one providing the evidence.
[01:10:24.449 --> 01:10:25.550]  I'm from Saudi Arabia.
[01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:26.329]  I'm an activist.
[01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:36.189]  I created a website to help people seeking asylum, especially from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region.
[01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:57.789]  His website has helped hundreds of Muslims flee the Gulf, where apostasy can be punished with a prison sentence or death.
[01:10:57.890 --> 01:11:04.850]  Yeah, I use basically WhatsApp, Twitter, Telegram.
[01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:14.770]  If I have time, I spend totally helping Saudi Islam seekers between 10 to 16 hours a day, if I have time.
[01:11:16.289 --> 01:11:22.289]  The only Arab country from which I did not have an ex-Muslim seeking help until now.
[01:11:22.289 --> 01:11:23.789]  This is supposedly the guy.
[01:11:24.289 --> 01:11:27.750]  As I understand it, supposedly the guy behind this Christmas attack.
[01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:36.710]  People who approach me are women between 18 and 30 years old.
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:47.699]  We're good to go.
[01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:55.189]  I wasn't allowed out with friends.
[01:11:55.329 --> 01:11:58.229]  I was forced to wear hijab.
[01:11:58.350 --> 01:12:03.609]  I always took it off when I went to school because I didn't like it and most of the girls in school didn't wear it.
[01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:08.470]  I enjoyed fasting because other people around me did it, but I was forced into that too.
[01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:10.970]  And as I got older, I hated it.
[01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:14.569]  There's a lot of group chats I'm actually in that have ex-Muslims in them.
[01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:19.850]  It's very nice to talk to someone with the same view as you.
[01:12:20.029 --> 01:12:24.949]  If you renounce Islam in UAE, you do get 15 years in prison.
[01:12:39.399 --> 01:12:45.140]  I decided to leave when my mother started bringing up marriage.
[01:12:45.439 --> 01:12:51.539]  I made it clear to her that I didn't want to, so I decided to leave right there and then.
[01:12:51.739 --> 01:12:55.020]  I was scared that my family would go tell on me.
[01:12:55.199 --> 01:13:02.220]  I was scared that they wouldn't get me out if I did get in jail.
[01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:07.149]  I don't miss my mom and dad, but I miss my sisters.
[01:13:07.489 --> 01:13:12.310]  I mean, if my little sister got older and she wanted to come here, I would help her.
[01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:14.430]  I would help her to come and be with me.
[01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:29.109]  And while the establishment parties in Germany do everything they can to shut down the AFD party, we see exactly why a right-wing populist party comes into popularity in a place like Germany that has fallen the victim of this massive migration.
[01:13:30.039 --> 01:13:35.159]  And it's not immigration or migration itself that is inherently the problem here.
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:40.020]  It's the fact that none of the migrants or immigrants that come into these countries want to assimilate with the culture whatsoever.
[01:13:40.279 --> 01:13:51.859]  I mean, the United States of America was founded itself on massive droves of immigration into the United States over the course of the last couple hundred years, especially the late 19th century into the early 20th century.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.840]  But everybody who came here assimilated.
[01:13:53.979 --> 01:14:01.390]  They actually believed in things like freedom of religion, freedom of speech, And the values that we are proud of here in the United States of America.
[01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:06.310]  But now Elon Musk is coming out and saying only the AFD can save Germany.
[01:14:06.569 --> 01:14:10.750]  Elon Musk endorses right-wing party as Germany awaits Bundestag disillusion.
[01:14:11.010 --> 01:14:13.670]  We're going to play clips 21 and 22 back-to-back.
[01:14:13.890 --> 01:14:25.470]  Tech billionaire Elon Musk has added his voice to Germany's political discourse, expressing support for the Alternative for Germany AFD party as the country faces a snap election early next year.
[01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:48.390]  Clips 21 and 22. Basically, the media have declared Friedrich Merz the winner, completely disregarding the existence of the AFD. And Friedrich Merz, just like every other party in fact, has already announced that he refuses to form a coalition with the AFD or even engage in any sort of discussion with them when it comes to political decision-making in the upcoming government.
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:15:01.739]  Fagumov Friedrich Merz intends to consider collaborating with the Green Party coward and economic imbecile Robert Habeck and he wants to form a coalition with the Green Party which would mean extending our eco-socialist national suicide.
[01:15:02.479 --> 01:15:03.960]  How can I be so sure?
[01:15:04.619 --> 01:15:34.739]  Well, Friedrich Merz has already slammed Javier Millier and Elon Musk's Doge mission implying that we will never Weder vorher noch nachher noch zu irgendeinem anderen Zeitpunkt gibt es eine Zusammenarbeit meiner Fraktion mit
[01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:41.460]  ihren Leuten, egal mit wie vielen Leuten Sie hier im nächsten Deutschen Bundestag sitzen werden.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:50.319]  Christian Lindner forderte in der Talkshow von Karen Miosga, mehr Millet zu wagen, sich also den ultraliberalen argentinischen Präsidenten zum Vorbild zu nehmen.
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.100]  Über diesen Vergleich zeigte sich Friedrich Merz bei Sandra Beich.
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:07.000]  I will on the other side.
[01:16:07.159 --> 01:16:08.260]  We're running a little bit low on time.
[01:16:08.399 --> 01:16:15.960]  So I'll go in on the other side to some of the remarks that Senator Manchin has made stating that the Democratic Party brand is toxic.
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:19.819]  And it's absolutely true that they have made themselves a toxic brand.
[01:16:20.989 --> 01:16:29.729]  They have sacrificed their brand as champions of minorities and individual liberty and freedom of speech and true journalism in the United States of America.
[01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:36.649]  And they have adopted, similar to what Coca-Cola did when they adopted New Coke, this new brand that nobody wants.
[01:16:36.810 --> 01:16:44.770]  Everybody wants the old Democratic Party back, the party that was not for every war, every single conflict, mass censorship, massive expansion of government.
[01:16:44.909 --> 01:16:47.109]  And maybe they were always for those things.
[01:16:47.939 --> 01:17:02.920]  But one thing is for sure, where before we had a Democratic Party and a Republican Party that were really participants in a uniparty, a single political party running the United States and being run by the deep state itself, now we finally have a second party.
[01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:13.229]  There are those among us who have advocated for years that we have a third party in the United States of America, but really what they're advocating for, whether they know it or not, is that we finally have a second party.
[01:17:13.689 --> 01:17:19.569]  Because you see, ever since the 1950s, we have actually been a one-party state, a uniparty state.
[01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:33.029]  But with the advent of MAGA republicanism, with the advent of populism under the leadership of the likes of Elon Musk and Donald Trump, finally we are actually introducing a second party into the political dynamic that is politics of the United States of America.
[01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:36.729]  And this is what really irks the deep state.
[01:17:36.829 --> 01:17:43.170]  This is what the political class really hates because now the Republican Party and the Democratic Party cannot simply conspire together.
[01:17:44.250 --> 01:18:00.770]  To pass things like 1547 page omnibus bills, or to get us into war after war, or to print thousands upon thousands, if not millions upon millions, if not billions upon billions, or trillions upon trillions of dollars within a short period of time, radically increasing the rate of inflation in the United States.
[01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:06.409]  See, they cannot conspire together anymore because finally there is a second party.
[01:18:07.079 --> 01:18:10.840]  It's called MAGA Republicans, and it's why you've heard Joe Biden and other leftists.
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:22.659]  It's even Republicans like Adam Kinzinger and Mitt Romney come out and say these extreme MAGA Republicans are a threat to our democracy, or the greatest threat to our national security in the United States is right-wing extremism.
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:27.800]  Of course, they're referring to MAGA Republicans, whom they disproportionately prosecute and persecute and imprison.
[01:18:31.079 --> 01:18:46.779]  And if we want total victory over this uniparty, this establishment that has been increasingly corrupt over the course of the last 50 years, while Americans wallow deeper and deeper into suffering and poverty, Then we have to ensure that the truth is broadcast worldwide.
[01:18:47.279 --> 01:18:56.880]  We have to ensure that the Alex Joneses and the Infowars hosts like Owen Schroer, Harrison Smith, and myself can stay on the air on platforms like X that fight for freedom of speech.
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:01.840]  Because without the truth, then lies can propagate and perpetuate.
[01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:14.289]  And because of you and your support at places like thealexjonesstore.com over the course of the last several years, especially the last several months, we have finally gotten to a place where we have the advantage in this information war.
[01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:17.930]  But they are going to fight back harder than ever in the coming weeks and the coming months.
[01:19:18.029 --> 01:19:21.850]  So we need your support now more than ever at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:24.470]  Go there now and be the reason Alex will always be on the air.
[01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:34.189]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host for the next one hour and two hours and 27 minutes.
[01:19:34.329 --> 01:19:37.289]  I'll be taking calls in the final hour of the broadcast today.
[01:19:37.630 --> 01:19:39.489]  Right out of the gate, I want to show you clip number five.
[01:19:39.630 --> 01:19:44.170]  This is Senator Manchin saying the Democratic Party brand is toxic.
[01:19:44.489 --> 01:19:54.989]  Senator Joe Manchin, independent from West Virginia, formerly a Democrat, told CNN on Sunday that he left the Democratic Party because the party's brand has become so toxic.
[01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:57.050]  Let's watch what he has to say right here.
[01:19:58.810 --> 01:20:01.189]  Do you still consider yourself a Democrat?
[01:20:02.489 --> 01:20:09.170]  I am not a Democrat in the form of what the Democratic Party has turned itself into, the national brand.
[01:20:09.569 --> 01:20:10.550]  Absolutely not.
[01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:11.989]  And they know that.
[01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:14.229]  They're all good people on both sides.
[01:20:14.329 --> 01:20:18.789]  But what do you think is the reason for, you said, you're not a Democrat.
[01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:22.609]  What caused Joe Manchin to divorce himself?
[01:20:22.770 --> 01:20:23.949]  Here's what I told them.
[01:20:24.130 --> 01:20:27.229]  I said, you ought to figure out how you lost somebody like me.
[01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:37.770]  I was born as a Democrat because of my grandfather's love of FDR. I was a very strong Democrat because of my family's love of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
[01:20:38.689 --> 01:20:40.670]  I came through the whole iteration.
[01:20:41.109 --> 01:20:49.050]  And I was a Democrat in West Virginia, and it has always been a 75-80% morality of Democrats, registered Democrats.
[01:20:49.609 --> 01:20:50.729]  But there was a split.
[01:20:50.949 --> 01:20:53.229]  I was never in the liberal side of it.
[01:20:53.250 --> 01:20:54.829]  I was never in the establishment side.
[01:20:55.579 --> 01:20:57.180]  So I always had to fight my way through.
[01:20:58.539 --> 01:21:01.859]  What is the shift on social issues?
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:03.420]  Yeah, the brand got so bad.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:10.399]  The D brand has been so maligned from the standpoint of it's just, it's toxic.
[01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:13.710]  And the D Brand is basically this, you know.
[01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:30.949]  I've told him, I said, first of all, as an American and as someone in Senate, and I'm going to take the Constitution, the Constitution that I take very, very, very, very seriously, I'm going to help every human being pursue the happiness in their life.
[01:21:31.689 --> 01:21:32.550]  Pursue the happiness.
[01:21:33.130 --> 01:21:34.369]  I don't care who they are.
[01:21:34.449 --> 01:21:35.149]  I don't care what color.
[01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:36.210]  I don't care any of the things.
[01:21:37.439 --> 01:21:38.460]  Do it, and that's you.
[01:21:38.619 --> 01:21:40.880]  I'm going to make sure you have the opportunity and right to live your life.
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:49.000]  Just don't make your life, if it might be on the extremes or in the minority of a few, make me believe that's the norm.
[01:21:49.979 --> 01:21:53.800]  Or make me and my family believe, or my children believe, or this or that.
[01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:54.479]  No.
[01:21:54.939 --> 01:21:56.119]  I will protect you.
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:58.699]  Just don't try to mainstream it.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:04.140]  And the Democratic Party, the Washington Democrats, have tried to mainstream the extreme.
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:07.920]  How would you describe what the Democratic brand is right now?
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:11.539]  In a couple of words, what is the Democratic brand?
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:19.920]  You know, it's basically infringement on me making decisions.
[01:22:20.159 --> 01:22:20.840]  And let me tell you why.
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:24.439]  The Democrat I grew up being, they wanted to make sure that people had an opportunity for a good job.
[01:22:25.399 --> 01:22:26.100]  A good pay.
[01:22:26.399 --> 01:22:31.060]  They would make sure you got a decent pay where you have some benefits and you can enjoy your family.
[01:22:31.779 --> 01:22:33.979]  And make sure you had a safe working condition.
[01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:34.939]  That was one of those things.
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:35.579]  Okay.
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:36.659]  That's all.
[01:22:36.899 --> 01:22:40.899]  They never got, they never infringed over and, oh, you can't live your life that way.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:41.899]  You can't say this.
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:42.659]  You can't do this.
[01:22:42.939 --> 01:22:44.579]  I mean, there was a fairness in it.
[01:22:44.579 --> 01:22:45.579]  So you think it's changed?
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:46.920]  It has changed tremendously.
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:23:00.220]  They have basically expanded upon Thinking, well, we wanted to protect you there, but we're going to tell you how you should live your life from that far on.
[01:23:00.319 --> 01:23:05.260]  It's the mindset of the left, the progressive left, which was always a minority.
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:16.739]  In West Virginia, the Democratic Party is perceived to pour more attention and more resources to people that are capable and able-bodied that won't work or don't work than those that do.
[01:23:16.939 --> 01:23:18.819]  And look, Senator Manchin is absolutely right.
[01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:23.220]  The Democratic brand has become toxic, and it's all their own fault.
[01:23:24.029 --> 01:23:29.890]  You have to keep in mind that all of the Democratic Party's support, starting in 2008, came from a couple of things.
[01:23:30.289 --> 01:23:42.130]  It came from a massive realization among or by the American people that the Republican Party, though, in conjunction with the Democratic Party, was in large responsible for war after war after war.
[01:23:42.409 --> 01:23:44.789]  We had the war in Afghanistan after 9-11.
[01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:49.789]  People became aware in a growing and growing way that 9-11 was likely an inside job.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:24:00.079]  Plus, there were the accusations that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which was used to justify the invasion of Iraq, and that war went on and on and on.
[01:24:00.699 --> 01:24:14.380]  And then there was the massive economic collapse between 2006 and 2008. So not only was the Republican Party under George W. Bush identified as the party of mass surveillance, massive war, but it was also identified as the party of...
[01:24:15.869 --> 01:24:16.989]  Financial corruption.
[01:24:17.409 --> 01:24:35.689]  When virtually no one except for I believe one financial professor, professional rather, was charged or prosecuted for any of the crimes that took place leading to the total collapse of our economy in 2008. All of that combined with the fact that the Republican Party had been particularly dogmatic.
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:54.520]  We're good to go.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:03.779]  But it was the party of dogma, no individual liberty whatsoever, no freedom of choice whatsoever.
[01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:05.760]  And it was the party of economic collapse.
[01:25:05.899 --> 01:25:14.079]  So Barack Obama was elected in 2008 promising that he would eradicate these issues which prevented whistleblowers from identifying the corruption of our own deep state.
[01:25:14.199 --> 01:25:19.079]  Of course, he went back on that promise and he chased after Edward Snowden more than perhaps any president would have.
[01:25:20.079 --> 01:25:37.180]  But the strength of the Democratic Party between 2008 and 2016 was in response to all of the corruption of the neoconservative element of the Republican Party from 2000 to 2008. People were sick of war after war after war, of dogmatic principle after dogmatic principle.
[01:25:37.659 --> 01:25:40.220]  And Barack Obama was seen as the solution to that.
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:45.100]  So in response to the financial corruption, he instituted the Affordable Care Act, which ended up being a travesty.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:50.239]  In response to all of the wars, Americans believed that Barack Obama was going to end those wars.
[01:25:50.399 --> 01:25:54.779]  And the only thing he really did, even close to accomplishing that, was the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:56.500]  But he didn't end any of the wars.
[01:25:56.619 --> 01:26:00.739]  In fact, Trump famously said he was the founder of ISIS, and I think in a large way he was right.
[01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:07.380]  Appointing the Secretary of State position for Hillary Clinton, who was responsible for Benghazi.
[01:26:08.479 --> 01:26:09.500]  Chasing whistleblowers.
[01:26:11.850 --> 01:26:14.550]  Hiding all of the thousands upon thousands of emails.
[01:26:14.949 --> 01:26:20.970]  Eric Holder with Fast and Furious and the disproportionate audits of conservative individuals or conservative organizations.
[01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:23.189]  While Democrats got away with stealing and stealing.
[01:26:23.569 --> 01:26:28.029]  While Vice President Joe Biden and his son conspired together to launder as much money as possible.
[01:26:28.909 --> 01:26:32.689]  With Rosemont Seneca investing...
[01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:43.710]  And companies like Metabiota, who then the same year received $24.3 million in Department of Defense contracts to conduct research in Ukrainian bio labs.
[01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:47.050]  All while red line after red line is crossed.
[01:26:47.939 --> 01:27:03.899]  And so after the early 2000s, when Americans became disenfranchised with the Republican Party, and then the 2008-2016 period where they became disenfranchised with the Democratic Party, realizing that they were all part of one uniparty, backing up one deep state,
[01:27:04.039 --> 01:27:08.079]  just from two different sides, then we elected a populist president.
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:10.359]  Donald Trump.
[01:27:11.789 --> 01:27:27.609]  Who came under fire because he was an outsider, who was the victim of charge after charge, prosecution after prosecution, impeachment after impeachment, and lie after lie from the political press, from the deep state itself, whether it was Comey, from his own Republican Party,
[01:27:27.729 --> 01:27:34.010]  whether it was Liz Cheney or Adam Kinzinger, from the Democratic Party, virtually all of them except for Manchin, whom you saw in that last clip.
[01:27:35.010 --> 01:27:40.210]  And then they stole the election from him and gave it to a dementia-ridden puppet for four years.
[01:27:40.409 --> 01:27:41.390]  Nothing got better.
[01:27:41.529 --> 01:27:42.390]  Everything got worse.
[01:27:42.409 --> 01:27:44.029]  And now we are finally back.
[01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:47.289]  I want to show you clips 26 through 28 back-to-back.
[01:27:47.409 --> 01:27:49.130]  26, 27, and 28 back-to-back.
[01:27:49.489 --> 01:28:02.510]  This is what unfolded on the floor right before our eyes this week in the context of Donald Trump and Elon Musk being empowered by the people to take our country back from this uniparty deep state conglomerate.
[01:28:03.810 --> 01:28:06.109]  And a tweet changed all of it?
[01:28:06.970 --> 01:28:14.970]  Can you imagine what the next two years are gonna be like if every time the Congress works its will and then there's a tweet?
[01:28:16.170 --> 01:28:24.770]  Or from an individual who has no official portfolio, who threatens members on the Republican side with a primary, and they succumb?
[01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:33.609]  This institution has a separate responsibility based upon the separation of powers.
[01:28:34.489 --> 01:28:38.409]  Members of Congress don't serve under presidents of the United States.
[01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:41.829]  Elon Musk, it's not the tweets, it's the reaction.
[01:28:42.090 --> 01:28:50.529]  I talked to a member of Congress today who told me that when the tweets started, immediately people from their own district started calling and asking questions.
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:52.640]  What are you spending my money on?
[01:28:52.739 --> 01:28:53.479]  What's going on here?
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:54.380]  It's not the tweets.
[01:28:54.859 --> 01:28:56.380]  It is how people are reacting.
[01:28:56.699 --> 01:28:59.479]  When they find out what's going on in Washington, then they pick up the phone.
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:00.460]  It's not the tweets.
[01:29:00.539 --> 01:29:01.199]  It's the people.
[01:29:01.279 --> 01:29:02.399]  So you say it's not about the people.
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:06.539]  I'm telling you, the people were flooding the congressional offices with calls today.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:09.100]  There's something to be said for that being part of the process.
[01:29:09.199 --> 01:29:10.520]  And is it a little messy here at night?
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:11.279]  Fine.
[01:29:11.439 --> 01:29:12.460]  I don't have a problem with messiness.
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.140]  They'll get something done eventually.
[01:29:15.029 --> 01:29:21.930]  I was in constant contact with President Trump throughout this process, spoke with him most recently about 45 minutes ago.
[01:29:22.689 --> 01:29:27.670]  He knew exactly what we were doing and why, and this is a good outcome for the country.
[01:29:27.829 --> 01:29:30.229]  I think he certainly is happy about this outcome as well.
[01:29:31.069 --> 01:29:38.069]  Elon Musk and I talked within about an hour ago, and we talked about the extraordinary challenges of this job.
[01:29:38.189 --> 01:29:39.630]  And I said, hey, you want to be Speaker of the House?
[01:29:39.649 --> 01:29:40.109]  I don't know.
[01:29:41.130 --> 01:29:43.109]  He said this may be the hardest job in the world.
[01:29:43.170 --> 01:29:43.649]  I think it is.
[01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:45.229]  But we're going to get through this.
[01:29:45.409 --> 01:29:52.449]  We are going to unify this country and we are going to bring the America First agenda to the people beginning in January.
[01:29:52.649 --> 01:29:53.890]  We cannot wait to get started.
[01:29:54.010 --> 01:30:00.510]  And how satisfying it is to see leftists on the floor complain about how one tweet can change everything.
[01:30:00.689 --> 01:30:06.989]  Frankly, I am very pleased to see that an outsider like Elon Musk can tweet once and millions upon millions of American outsiders.
[01:30:06.989 --> 01:30:07.970]  Remember George Carlin.
[01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:09.750]  It's a club and you ain't in it.
[01:30:14.050 --> 01:30:21.550]  We're good to go.
[01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:50.449]  We're good to go.
[01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:02.869]  By the Department of Justice.
[01:31:03.149 --> 01:31:04.350]  By the political class.
[01:31:04.529 --> 01:31:05.270]  By the press.
[01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:06.409]  This is clip number 30 here.
[01:31:06.529 --> 01:31:11.750]  This is Tim Pool shutting down the leftist argument saying that these J6ers should be in prison.
[01:31:11.869 --> 01:31:12.390]  Please watch.
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:14.500]  You have?
[01:31:14.779 --> 01:31:15.739]  No, I haven't.
[01:31:15.859 --> 01:31:16.920]  No, no, no, stop, stop.
[01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:19.079]  You don't know anything about these January 6th cases.
[01:31:19.119 --> 01:31:20.800]  You don't know why these people are in jail.
[01:31:20.939 --> 01:31:24.560]  You don't know that a man is in Brooklyn right now for three years without charge or trial.
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:29.659]  And when Donald Trump says, these people have been held for too long, you say, no, Trump is wrong.
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:30.680]  Keep them locked up.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.359]  That's fucking fascist.
[01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:38.569]  Dude, you have been sitting here with no knowledge of the specifics of some of these cases.
[01:31:38.789 --> 01:31:43.010]  There is a man in Brooklyn right now, I'm going to say it again, no charges whatsoever brought.
[01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:45.329]  He's been in jail for three fucking years.
[01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:49.390]  For you to sit there and say it is good that he remains locked up is fascism.
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:55.399]  That is saying the hierarchy, the hierarchical system of the courts and the government is just and the process is all that matters.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:32:02.659]  And I am saying perhaps three years is enough because I actually have moral logic and an understanding of these cases.
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:07.600]  Hence, my position on January 6th has always been the people who have attacked police must go to prison.
[01:32:07.930 --> 01:32:10.930]  But three years is a fucking long time for assault on an officer.
[01:32:11.329 --> 01:32:16.489]  We have seen people on the far left, notably when they were firebombing shit all across Minnesota.
[01:32:16.750 --> 01:32:18.329]  33 people murdered.
[01:32:18.529 --> 01:32:20.350]  And how many criminal charges do we get for this?
[01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:36.909]  When they firebombed a police station and forced the police to evacuate on May 29th, 2020. When thousands of far leftists firebombed the White House grounds and set fire to St. John's Church and injured 100 police officers, how many fucking people went to prison for three years?
[01:32:37.069 --> 01:32:40.270]  How many of them who never showed up on that day are in prison for 20 years?
[01:32:40.569 --> 01:32:44.050]  Enrique Tarrio wasn't even in D.C. on January 6th.
[01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:48.630]  And you are saying that man, who only, his only crime was, quote, don't leave.
[01:32:48.850 --> 01:32:49.710]  That's his only crime.
[01:32:49.850 --> 01:32:52.489]  You think he should be in prison for 20 years because you're a fascist.
[01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:53.750]  You don't care what the facts are.
[01:32:53.850 --> 01:32:55.390]  You don't care if this is unjust.
[01:32:55.750 --> 01:33:00.510]  You only care that the machine state has decreed you are not to be locked up.
[01:33:00.689 --> 01:33:02.369]  And this is the problem I have with the left.
[01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:03.550]  They don't know the facts.
[01:33:03.689 --> 01:33:04.770]  They don't care about the facts.
[01:33:04.930 --> 01:33:07.590]  They view morality as a blanket government stroke of the pen.
[01:33:07.770 --> 01:33:11.449]  And every person, regardless of their crime, should be in prison for decades.
[01:33:11.609 --> 01:33:12.649]  I reject it outright.
[01:33:12.850 --> 01:33:15.329]  The people who fought cops should go to prison.
[01:33:15.449 --> 01:33:15.970]  They did.
[01:33:16.109 --> 01:33:17.149]  It's been three years.
[01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:22.869]  But when you've got people who are on misdemeanor charges for having walked into a building at 4 p.m.
[01:33:23.050 --> 01:33:27.340]  after the riot, and I know some of these people, They walked into a building for two minutes and walked out.
[01:33:27.479 --> 01:33:29.380]  And they got 18 months for that.
[01:33:29.539 --> 01:33:36.020]  I don't see you defending the innocent people who walked onto a public grass at a public building after a right had been completed.
[01:33:36.199 --> 01:33:36.819]  You don't know.
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:37.600]  You don't care.
[01:33:37.739 --> 01:33:40.760]  You've taken a tribal position and people are suffering because of it.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:48.000]  Now you say that Donald Trump saying the injustice that we've seen warrants commutation or pardons, you say that means he's advocating for violence.
[01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:49.680]  This is the ultimate problem.
[01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:53.199]  Then you cite a press release from Maryland saying, but the right's more violent.
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:34:01.220]  There is a distinction between a white supremacist as a right-wing group and a run-of-the-mill Christian conservative who showed up on that day not to protest.
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:02.859]  Let's talk about Brandon Strzok.
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:04.000]  He never went in the building.
[01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:05.739]  He was on the other side of the building.
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:07.020]  There was a permanent protest.
[01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:09.420]  He walked up the stairs and he was yelling.
[01:34:09.579 --> 01:34:11.100]  They put this guy in prison.
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:16.739]  There is Owen Schroyer, who was at a permanent rally, who was yelling death to communists.
[01:34:16.949 --> 01:34:20.090]  They put him in prison and specifically cited his speech.
[01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:22.590]  My dude, you don't know what you're talking about.
[01:34:22.770 --> 01:34:23.590]  And it's fine.
[01:34:23.729 --> 01:34:24.109]  I get it.
[01:34:24.170 --> 01:34:24.890]  We try to be polite.
[01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:25.609]  We try to be nice.
[01:34:25.789 --> 01:34:33.090]  But there are so many young liberals who sit here and say, the corporate press told me that these people are bad and the machine state government has decreed it by pen.
[01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:34.789]  So I don't care what crime they committed.
[01:34:34.930 --> 01:34:36.210]  I don't care what the jury said.
[01:34:36.409 --> 01:34:37.489]  I don't care who was on the jury.
[01:34:37.770 --> 01:34:40.630]  Enrique Tarrio, who was not there, should be in prison for two decades.
[01:34:40.949 --> 01:34:41.590]  Tell me this now.
[01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:43.010]  Why is Enrique Tarrio in prison?
[01:34:43.399 --> 01:34:47.960]  Yeah, so they uncovered with him his plot to overthrow the government.
[01:34:48.739 --> 01:34:49.560]  Enrique Torres?
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:51.060]  Yeah, and his organization.
[01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:51.640]  What plot?
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:52.939]  Who's they?
[01:34:54.029 --> 01:34:56.210]  Give me some fucking data.
[01:34:56.489 --> 01:34:59.109]  Stop squinting at me and saying the prosecutors did a thing.
[01:34:59.210 --> 01:34:59.770]  You didn't know.
[01:34:59.890 --> 01:35:00.489]  You didn't read it.
[01:35:00.630 --> 01:35:01.649]  You didn't read the court papers.
[01:35:01.989 --> 01:35:05.329]  All you know is the fascist machine state told you he should be in prison.
[01:35:05.710 --> 01:35:06.390]  And Tim Pool is absolutely right.
[01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:09.050]  These leftists have officially declared themselves fascist.
[01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:12.670]  They call you a fascist, but all of their policies are fascist themselves.
[01:35:12.670 --> 01:35:23.470]  Whether it's omnibus bills, whether it's the way they disproportionately persecute and prosecute their political opposition, whether it's the way they weaponize the mainstream media by lying on their behalf, to lie on their behalf.
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:38.760]  Whether it's the way they justify censorship of the American people by saying it's the White House's freedom of speech and expression to encourage major social media platforms to censor individuals or claims on their platforms.
[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:54.500]  You have to keep in mind, they came out and just declared that it was protected under the White House's First Amendment rights, that it encouraged, while it's in office, the existing sitting White House, to encourage and pressure social media platforms like Twitter when it was publicly traded, Facebook, Instagram,
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:57.140]  Snapchat, you name it, TikTok.
[01:35:57.479 --> 01:36:04.760]  It's okay for our CIA, our deep state, to pressure these institutions, these organizations, and these businesses to censor as much as possible.
[01:36:05.319 --> 01:36:08.239]  And that's what they've been doing for at least 10 years, if not longer.
[01:36:08.359 --> 01:36:23.939]  It really started in 2016. First they blamed Cambridge Analytica for the loss of the election in 2016. When Donald Trump won, they said it was because Steve Bannon and others were selling data and information that Russia was able to use and exploit.
[01:36:25.369 --> 01:36:26.529]  To sway this election.
[01:36:27.069 --> 01:36:29.130]  Mark Zuckerberg came and spoke before Congress.
[01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:32.409]  He was sitting in his suit and he was behaving so politely.
[01:36:32.970 --> 01:36:39.029]  Sipping on his water, looking like an alien, saying Senator yes, Senator no, Senator respectfully, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator.
[01:36:39.250 --> 01:36:40.189]  He was playing ball.
[01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:44.689]  And I don't know if you remember the movie Social Networks, the movie that came out about Mark Zuckerberg and the founding of...
[01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:45.829]  Facebook.
[01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:47.210]  Very good movie.
[01:36:47.529 --> 01:36:48.289]  Quite accurate.
[01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:53.770]  There was a time when Mark Zuckerberg was a very rebellious tech bro, showing up to meetings in his pajamas.
[01:36:54.109 --> 01:36:55.010]  He was flippant.
[01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.609]  He didn't care.
[01:36:55.729 --> 01:36:57.369]  He knew that he had all the power and all the leverage.
[01:36:57.710 --> 01:37:05.750]  Suddenly something happened in 2016 and you have Mark Zuckerberg putting on a suit and basically kissing ass on the Senate floor for these hearings.
[01:37:05.869 --> 01:37:10.189]  And after that, there was fear in the hearts of every major tech bro.
[01:37:11.039 --> 01:37:28.899]  Every CEO of every major tech company, every mid-level manager, every employee, and they started implementing things like ESG and DEI and massive censorship, and they did it all on behalf of the deep state, who we now know, because of the Twitter files, was having regular meetings with censorship departments of these institutions.
[01:37:28.899 --> 01:37:29.840]  That's all fine.
[01:37:30.949 --> 01:37:49.710]  Turns out when you censor the truth, while simultaneously propping up lies on all the mainstream media outlets, you have a whole class of people, a whole segment of your population as high as 50%, like that young man that was sitting there with Tim Pool, who think it's okay for someone to be in jail for three years without charges having been brought.
[01:37:49.770 --> 01:37:53.069]  You have a right to a fair and speedy trial here in the United States of America.
[01:37:53.229 --> 01:37:57.010]  Sitting in jail without charges for three years is not just.
[01:37:57.829 --> 01:37:59.029]  It is unconstitutional.
[01:37:59.029 --> 01:37:59.489]  I understand.
[01:37:59.609 --> 01:38:00.229]  I agree with Tim Pool.
[01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:02.670]  I think there were people that committed crimes on January 6th.
[01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:04.489]  Assaulting an officer is not excusable.
[01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:15.329]  Of course, it was due to entrapment by the feds that were there encouraging people to go into the building, encouraging people to break in, even giving tours to people like the Q Shaman who was famously there.
[01:38:16.850 --> 01:38:20.989]  But I know so many people who have spent time in prison or jail or have been swatted because of this.
[01:38:21.069 --> 01:38:21.890]  I know Steve Bannon.
[01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:23.430]  I know Brandon Strzok.
[01:38:23.569 --> 01:38:24.810]  I know Owen Schroyer.
[01:38:25.250 --> 01:38:31.449]  I know others who have been victims of this deep state just simply attacking people because of the position that they hold.
[01:38:31.529 --> 01:38:39.270]  And the fact of the matter is, it's hard for anyone in America to name a single person who was convicted or charged for setting the White House guard tower on fire.
[01:38:39.289 --> 01:38:51.810]  But you can name a litany of people who have been charged by this deep state, by this corrupt regime, For the actions that took place on January 6th, we know and it's documented and it's been reported that there were feds there encouraging people to commit this crime.
[01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:56.329]  That Antifa was dressing up like MAGA supporters to coax the crowd into going in.
[01:38:56.369 --> 01:38:57.130]  It was a trap.
[01:38:59.409 --> 01:39:03.569]  And everything from this political establishment is a trap on the American people as well.
[01:39:03.909 --> 01:39:11.689]  I don't know if you've seen the chart of how complicated the tax code has become since the early 70s, but it is an exponential graph.
[01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:13.750]  It's a parabola.
[01:39:13.909 --> 01:39:14.869]  It's not linear.
[01:39:15.130 --> 01:39:17.010]  It just skyrockets.
[01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:24.270]  The tax code is so complicated that it's impossible for you not to inadvertently break a tax law every time you file your taxes every single year.
[01:39:24.829 --> 01:39:27.369]  All of our laws have become so complicated it's impossible.
[01:39:27.449 --> 01:39:39.329]  They're trying to pass 1547 page omnibus bills with 12 hours notice when the rules say they're supposed to have 72 hours notice because they want to sneak in things like funding the global industrial censorship complex.
[01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:55.340]  They want to fund biolabs all over the country when we know, based on every single report, that the biolab responsible for the last pandemic, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was funded by Fauci for gain-of-function research that manufactured the virus that spread all over the world.
[01:39:55.479 --> 01:40:00.420]  And then they want to justify it by saying that the vaccine saved so many lives.
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:07.819]  And they want to push the inoculation of everyone in the country from a six-month-old baby and up with these experimental drugs.
[01:40:07.819 --> 01:40:09.100]  And we know that they never worked.
[01:40:10.739 --> 01:40:15.960]  They didn't prevent people from getting COVID. They didn't prevent people from transmitting COVID to one another.
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:19.119]  They just gave everybody myocarditis.
[01:40:19.119 --> 01:40:28.359]  And it was a test that our government ran so they could see how many people would comply with their laws in a state of fear, out of a fearful psychological mindset.
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.380]  This is clip number 57 here.
[01:40:30.479 --> 01:40:46.210]  This is RFK owning a liberal who says they never said vaccines prevented COVID. Let's watch 57. They say, what they're saying, out of 22,000 people, there was one COVID death among the vaccinated, and there was two COVID deaths on the unvaccinable,
[01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:47.470]  22,000 people.
[01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:52.510]  And that allowed them to claim it's 100% effective.
[01:40:52.689 --> 01:40:53.510]  Effective for what?
[01:40:53.649 --> 01:40:54.789]  You can't use the word effective.
[01:40:55.130 --> 01:41:00.829]  You remember they kept saying it's 100% No, they just said it'll negate the severity.
[01:41:01.170 --> 01:41:04.010]  If you go on the internet, you can see Tony Fauci.
[01:41:04.010 --> 01:41:06.909]  But the word effective didn't say you won't.
[01:41:07.029 --> 01:41:08.850]  I never heard you won't get COVID. Oh, yeah.
[01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:10.510]  Well, this is a different subject.
[01:41:10.670 --> 01:41:25.789]  But, yeah, in fact, I saw a tape yesterday of them all, of Biden, Fauci, Gates, you know, Berla, all of them saying, if you take the vaccine, Rachel Maddow, if you take the vaccine, you can't get COVID, you can't pass COVID. I didn't see that.
[01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:27.579]  Okay, well, you know what?
[01:41:27.739 --> 01:41:28.699]  Can I play it for you?
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:28.979]  Yeah.
[01:41:29.579 --> 01:41:29.859]  All right.
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:32.100]  And we're going to find this compilation.
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:35.380]  We're going to find it and show it to you sometime in the next hour because you've seen it.
[01:41:35.539 --> 01:41:45.600]  We all know that the mainstream media, the Rachel Maddows and others, said that if you take the vaccine, you're not going to get COVID. Then they said if you take it, well, or if you get COVID after you've taken it, then you're not going to be able to transmit it.
[01:41:45.699 --> 01:41:50.380]  Then they said you can transmit it, but the vaccines make the infection less dangerous.
[01:41:50.699 --> 01:41:51.479]  That's what they said.
[01:41:53.199 --> 01:42:11.970]  And then the press club has the audacity to come out And say that the reason that nobody trusts the mainstream media, the reason that nobody trusts the press, is because Elon Musk is a billionaire who is abusing his power and influence to manipulate and lie and coerce the people of America to believe lies.
[01:42:12.449 --> 01:42:21.430]  Maybe it's because you guys have been lying about virtually everything, incessantly, non-stop, for decades, especially the last eight years.
[01:42:23.119 --> 01:42:24.220]  I want to show you this next clip.
[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:28.340]  This is clip 69. Joe Rogan and Dave Smith talking about why X is the most trusted.
[01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:28.779]  Let's watch.
[01:42:29.479 --> 01:42:30.960]  You know, there was...
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:33.520]  X is the number one news source on earth.
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:33.899]  Yeah.
[01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:34.579]  On earth.
[01:42:35.039 --> 01:42:38.640]  It's the most trusted because it's the only one that's not fucked with.
[01:42:39.239 --> 01:42:39.359]  Yeah.
[01:42:39.479 --> 01:42:42.199]  So even if someone's incorrect, the community notes will correct them.
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:42.720]  Yep.
[01:42:43.039 --> 01:42:44.739]  The community notes are rock solid.
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.560]  It's a great way to find out what's real and what's not real.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:50.039]  And then you look in the comments and you see people debating it.
[01:42:50.409 --> 01:42:51.710]  And it's happening in real time.
[01:42:51.850 --> 01:42:53.770]  And it's happening whenever something breaks.
[01:42:53.970 --> 01:42:57.949]  And it's way better than what you're going to get on corporate-controlled media.
[01:42:58.069 --> 01:42:58.689]  It's way better.
[01:42:58.789 --> 01:43:03.770]  Elon Musk buying Twitter was at least as important as Trump winning the election again.
[01:43:03.850 --> 01:43:04.250]  Maybe more.
[01:43:04.409 --> 01:43:09.510]  The most important thing about Trump winning might be that he's able to stop them from coming after Elon Musk.
[01:43:09.699 --> 01:43:18.319]  Well, that's a big factor, but I also think that Elon Musk buying Twitter, if that doesn't happen, I don't think Trump wins the way he wins.
[01:43:18.579 --> 01:43:19.680]  Oh, 100%.
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:20.760]  I think it's real tight.
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:23.560]  I think if he does win, it's barely.
[01:43:23.979 --> 01:43:25.899]  Okay, let's take podcasts out.
[01:43:25.930 --> 01:43:27.289]  All right, folks, we're coming up on a break.

[01:45:10.210 --> 01:45:11.609]  Okay, it's a vitamin-mineral fusion.
[01:45:12.090 --> 01:45:14.069]  You know, amino acid, you know, fusion, great.
[01:45:14.189 --> 01:45:15.109]  It's just a staple product.
