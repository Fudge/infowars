[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.350]  And this is just tons of these videos every day.
[00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.391]  Standard deal.
[00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:05.031]  Stomp on somebody's head until they're dead.
[00:00:05.051 --> 00:00:18.718]  Here it is.
[00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:24.681]  And then they drag him out as he dies and throw him out the front door.
[00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:27.322]  There he is, dying, bleeding out in the brain.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.560]  Hey, shoot a video of it.
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.081]  Upload it.
[00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:37.563]  No second order thinking.
[00:00:40.464 --> 00:00:41.645]  Hey, we just killed this guy.
[00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:42.425]  What's going to happen to us?
[00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:43.485]  Probably six months in jail.
[00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:50.468]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[00:00:58.716 --> 00:01:05.355]   In a letter written to Congress by 10 retired FBI agents, including former directors, assistant
[00:01:05.355 --> 00:01:12.155]   directors and special agents in charge, every concern facing the American people over our
[00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.075]  invaded border was verified.
[00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:21.036]   "The surge in numbers of single military-aged males descending upon American cities and
[00:01:21.036 --> 00:01:23.234]  towns is alarming and perilous.
[00:01:23.234 --> 00:01:28.676]   Additionally, they are not just from terror-linked regions, but from China and Russia as well."
[00:01:28.676 --> 00:01:36.316]   "Hostile adversaries of the United States with aspirations to devastate national infrastructure."
[00:01:36.316 --> 00:01:42.795]   For these reasons, elements of this recent surge are likely no accident or coincidence.
[00:01:42.937 --> 00:01:49.259]  These men are potential operators in what appears to be an accelerated and strategic penetration.
[00:01:49.539 --> 00:02:01.922]  A soft invasion, designed to gain internal access to a country that cannot be invaded militarily in order to inflict catastrophic damage if and when enemies deem it necessary.
[00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:10.306]  Well, now we know for a fact the United Nations is funding the migrant crisis, we can stop guessing, from the Center for Immigration Studies.
[00:02:10.446 --> 00:02:15.208]  United Nations budgets million for U.S.-bound migrants in 2024.
[00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:21.892]  Public documents show cash handouts to help feed, transport, and house people headed for the U.S.
[00:02:21.912 --> 00:02:22.152]  border.
[00:02:22.372 --> 00:02:41.387]  You know, in a nutshell, the United Nations and its advocacy partners are planning to spread the $372 million in cash and voucher assistance and multi-purpose cash assistance to some 624,000 immigrants in transit to the United States during 2024.
[00:02:41.547 --> 00:02:46.231]  Does this look honestly like this would stop anybody?
[00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:47.412]  It's a joke.
[00:02:48.813 --> 00:02:55.197]  And Governor Abbott, for three years, have just been letting people in, millions at a time, and now he's making a stand over this?
[00:02:55.837 --> 00:02:56.578]  Over this?
[00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:58.579]  That's what this is all about?
[00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.281]  I'm just trying to put it in perspective for people.
[00:03:01.321 --> 00:03:02.342]  That's all I'm trying to do.
[00:03:03.002 --> 00:03:05.184]  The truth is the truth, no matter how it looks.
[00:03:05.604 --> 00:03:06.445]  And that's the truth.
[00:03:06.505 --> 00:03:07.485]  Take a look at it one more time.
[00:03:08.086 --> 00:03:09.987]  This is what it's about, America, right here.
[00:03:10.387 --> 00:03:13.690]  This cheap wire, that they can come over here and cut themselves.
[00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:41.632]  President Biden's threat to force Texas Governor Abbott to face the consequences should Texas not abide by the Biden administration's demand that razor wire be removed from the Texas border so that millions more non-naturalized military-aged men can flood the border to go who knows where to prepare for who knows what has so far resulted in the White House freezing new natural gas export licenses.
[00:03:41.992 --> 00:03:44.953]  As if Biden were sanctioning a foreign enemy.
[00:03:45.373 --> 00:04:00.878]  Meanwhile, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, World Economic Forum member and reoccurring Davos attendee, was on the other side of the world, in India, opening a back door for globalization in Texas with the Texas Economic Development Corporation.
[00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:03.320]  Yeah, it's not a coincidence that he went to Mumbai.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.164]  Keep in mind, Mumbai is, well, the beginning of the new Indo-European corridor.
[00:04:09.524 --> 00:04:15.649]  Just like I-69 down there in McAllen and other places down there in Brownsville, those three feeders that then go up to Detroit.
[00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.552]  Keep in mind, World Economic Forum also has a big presence in Detroit.
[00:04:19.852 --> 00:04:22.995]  But the bottom line is, a lot of this is about trade corridors.
[00:04:23.195 --> 00:04:25.857]  These little fights are like swatting mosquitoes.
[00:04:26.357 --> 00:04:30.198]  Don't get killed in Eagle Pass.
[00:04:30.818 --> 00:04:32.479]  We got a much bigger thing going on.
[00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:34.660]  We've got a much bigger fish to fry.
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.140]  None of this makes sense.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.062]  A real president following his duty wouldn't disregard our national security to the level of treason.
[00:04:43.302 --> 00:04:50.505]  We are sitting idly by waiting on a false flag to be followed by martial law in the cancellation of the 2024 election.
[00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:57.949]  As you may know, I have had my insurance license in the state of California for over a decade.
[00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:04.593]  And when I was reviewing policies for 2024, I noticed this new exclusion.
[00:05:04.834 --> 00:05:13.739]  Treatment of an injury or sickness which is due to war, declared or undeclared, riot or insurrection.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.561]  This is not typical.
[00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:16.901]  Check this out.
[00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:21.563]  They actually have the camouflage clothes of the illegal aliens hanging up in the tree.
[00:05:21.623 --> 00:05:23.323]  So these are the illegals that don't want to get caught.
[00:05:23.343 --> 00:05:24.484]  These are the so-called runners.
[00:05:25.084 --> 00:05:35.588]  This camp that's partially funded by Pima County, that is operated under the Universalist Unitarian Church out of Tucson, Arizona, is aiding and abetting cartel runners.
[00:05:36.488 --> 00:05:37.268]  It's Monday, January 29th, 2024.
[00:05:37.328 --> 00:05:38.469]  We're 280 days, 12 hours, 53 minutes, 38 seconds out.
[00:05:38.288 --> 00:05:45.288]   Murder is an open bleeding wound slashed repeatedly by the United Nations infiltration of Agenda
[00:05:45.288 --> 00:05:46.288]  2030.
[00:05:46.288 --> 00:05:49.408]  This is no longer clouded by speculation.
[00:05:49.408 --> 00:05:51.769]  This is exactly what is happening.
[00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:53.288]  Prepare now.
[00:05:53.288 --> 00:05:54.568]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:05:54.568 --> 00:05:57.568]  It's Monday, January 29th, 2024.
[00:05:57.568 --> 00:06:03.007]  We're 280 days, 12 hours, 53 minutes, 38 seconds out.
[00:06:03.007 --> 00:06:06.688]  The most important election in modern history.
[00:06:06.688 --> 00:06:10.687]  Wow.
[00:06:10.687 --> 00:06:11.687]  It's just insane.
[00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:21.687]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.121]  The good news is people are really waking up to the fact that this country is being destroyed from within.
[00:06:18.842 --> 00:06:20.922]  America is being destroyed by design.
[00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:24.363]  That's the name of my first documentary film I made in 2000, excuse me, I made in 1997.
[00:06:25.584 --> 00:06:28.584]  Excuse me, I made it 1997.
[00:06:28.584 --> 00:06:32.584]  Time has certainly flown past us here.
[00:06:32.584 --> 00:06:35.584]  And this is what we are witnessing.
[00:06:35.914 --> 00:06:54.839]  And I want to explain how the big tax-free foundations, created by the robber barons 120-something years ago, had a mission to destroy the American culture that we had, and why they couldn't have their monopoly and their global domination if America continued to be free.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.501]  And what they've now turned the country into, and how that's a model for the world.
[00:07:01.257 --> 00:07:09.182]  Whereas America could be a model for the world of freedom, it'll be a model for the world of oppression, demonization, and maximum tyranny.
[00:07:11.023 --> 00:07:22.869]  And one good place to start is obviously what they've done in the schools, dumbing people down, how the border's been dissolved, how they've worked so hard to break up the family and done a fabulous job doing it.
[00:07:25.331 --> 00:07:28.233]  And now we're moving against the holdouts that have been resistant to it.
[00:07:28.253 --> 00:07:30.534]  They're literally coming after our children.
[00:07:32.142 --> 00:07:35.764]  But there's one window into it that is so crystal clear.
[00:07:38.245 --> 00:07:41.967]  It's the first thing I want to hit when we get to that area of the discussion later in the hour.
[00:07:42.827 --> 00:07:55.574]  And that is how the CIA, on record, financed and funded the Summer of Love and rock and roll and the whole hippie movement.
[00:07:58.032 --> 00:08:09.542]  To create a fake counterculture and how they went even further by hijacking hip-hop in the early 1980s and turning it into gangster rap.
[00:08:10.883 --> 00:08:23.293]  And I've sat there with the record executives and I've sat there with the major hip-hop artists and I've sat there with the major rock and roll stars and they all were read into it and told about it and it was explained to them.
[00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:25.866]  Remember the mid-1980s?
[00:08:25.926 --> 00:08:34.230]  Suddenly all of the rock and roll and all of the big heavy metal bands that were number one at the time suddenly started having rappers on with them.
[00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:39.153]  That's because they were ordered to do so by the record producers.
[00:08:39.933 --> 00:08:45.416]  And I've been told this face-to-face by Dave Mustaine of Metallica and then Megadeth.
[00:08:45.877 --> 00:08:51.520]  I've been told this face-to-face by the head of Smashing Pumpkins.
[00:08:53.604 --> 00:09:00.389]  I've been told this by a lot of other people off record, but I dug out a bunch of documents today.
[00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:15.981]  It's a pretty big stack here in video clips because Ice Cube, who's been doing a great job standing up to the poison shots and the gun control and the tyranny, he came out and just admitted and said, yeah, it's true.
[00:09:16.701 --> 00:09:36.863]   The record executives would basically tell us what to produce, tell us what to say, They would put guardrails on us, and they said, if you want the big money, create a thug culture, which is a pipeline for young people, first blacks and now everybody, to think that it's cool to be attached to thug culture.
[00:09:37.284 --> 00:09:42.410]  So they've weaponized black culture, destroyed the black family, and now they're moving on to everybody else.
[00:09:44.531 --> 00:09:55.078]  So I'm going to be talking about that at the bottom of the hour and what it leads to and why we have crime statistics of 22 to 1 black on white crime.
[00:09:55.378 --> 00:09:57.280]  And it's not the average black person doing this.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:05.905]  It's a very small sliver of teenage young black men that's still a small sliver of teenage young black men.
[00:10:07.226 --> 00:10:12.230]  Most young teenage black men are trying to get good grades playing football or basketball or baseball.
[00:10:13.288 --> 00:10:18.030]  But even those after-school programs are being taken away and it's sick.
[00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:25.853]  But it is a very tiny minority of young black males that are committing the largest slice of crime in this country.
[00:10:25.893 --> 00:10:32.195]  Kind of like in places like El Salvador, it was a very tiny sliver of young men committing 90% of the crime.
[00:10:33.455 --> 00:10:39.483]   And it was because older men knew how to brainwash young street kids With MS-13 born in U.S.
[00:10:39.503 --> 00:10:44.006]  prisons but exported back to Central and South America and take over society.
[00:10:45.566 --> 00:10:56.893]  Then the leftist media basically promotes attacks on white people including Law & Order has a new show out where a black teenager rapes a white woman and it's good because she's white.
[00:10:59.315 --> 00:11:05.640]  And so it's Hollywood running this and pushing this, and they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:11.164]  So I'm going to talk about it all at the bottom of the hour, and I'm going to play these clips.
[00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:17.349]  Now, I see these clips of murders of white people every day.
[00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:21.973]  Shot in the back of the head, run over, beaten to death.
[00:11:23.233 --> 00:11:24.234]  You see it all the time.
[00:11:24.314 --> 00:11:26.196]  Some little white nerd is at school.
[00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:32.584]  Somebody grabs their headphones away, they grab back, and 15 black kids beat him to death.
[00:11:34.805 --> 00:11:36.586]  And when it happens, the media tries to cover it up.
[00:11:37.067 --> 00:11:47.433]  And when I posted last night a video that got millions and millions of views from a local newscast, the kid died.
[00:11:49.294 --> 00:11:52.136]  He was reportedly over trying to visit some friends at a house.
[00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:57.159]  Some older black teenagers were there and beat him to death.
[00:11:58.371 --> 00:12:04.037]  Leftists went on my ex-account, Real Alex Jones, and said that I was being racist.
[00:12:05.739 --> 00:12:08.522]  I'm not putting this out to demonize black people in general.
[00:12:09.783 --> 00:12:15.349]  If I started seeing videos everywhere of white people stomping black kids to death, I would put it out and say this is wrong.
[00:12:17.242 --> 00:12:27.390]  Or when we saw the Capitol Police famously shoot the black woman for no reason, because she drove down the wrong road, and then it came out she was black, and I got all this praise from the black community saying, oh, you care about us.
[00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.831]  I said, I don't care if it's a black lady or a white lady.
[00:12:30.232 --> 00:12:30.992]  Innocent murdered.
[00:12:32.453 --> 00:12:34.895]  I don't care if it's a black baby or a white baby being aborted.
[00:12:34.995 --> 00:12:35.556]  I'm against it.
[00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:42.180]  But the point is, is that the corporate media is trying to hide this because they're the ones promoting it.
[00:12:43.201 --> 00:12:44.302]  They're the ones pushing it.
[00:12:45.343 --> 00:12:48.008]   And It is 22 to 1.
[00:12:50.169 --> 00:12:50.970]  Violent crime.
[00:12:53.271 --> 00:12:53.891]  Black on white.
[00:12:54.812 --> 00:13:01.536]  Meanwhile, the FBI and the Justice Department go up and give press conferences with no evidence to say the number one crime is white supremacy.
[00:13:01.856 --> 00:13:02.797]  It's the number one threat.
[00:13:02.837 --> 00:13:04.958]  It's the number one cause of death from crime.
[00:13:05.278 --> 00:13:06.179]  That's totally made up.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:12.022]  And now the FBI suppresses crime statistics.
[00:13:12.062 --> 00:13:21.496]   So it's a national sport To gang up and beat up and kill white people, or push white people in front of subway trains.
[00:13:21.576 --> 00:13:22.877]  I mean, you know all about it, folks.
[00:13:23.318 --> 00:13:24.699]  I could play you hours of this.
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.643]  And I tell you what, because the leftists don't like me doing it, we're going to do a lot of it.
[00:13:29.584 --> 00:13:30.005]  How about that?
[00:13:30.045 --> 00:13:31.446]  In fact, let's play the latest video.
[00:13:32.767 --> 00:13:33.208]  Here it is.
[00:13:33.268 --> 00:13:34.149]  This kid died.
[00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:34.890]  We'll play it with audio.
[00:13:36.172 --> 00:13:37.113]  Where are the protests?
[00:13:37.213 --> 00:13:38.974]  I see new videos like this every day.
[00:13:39.335 --> 00:13:42.497]  The court media are pushing a narrative that white people deserve to die.
[00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:48.262]  The real white privilege is living in a world where it's open season on you if you're white.
[00:13:49.323 --> 00:13:49.823]  Here he is.
[00:13:50.524 --> 00:13:55.408]  He gets hit, knocked over, stomped on the head a bunch, cracks the skull, final kick in the head.
[00:13:55.428 --> 00:13:57.429]  You can tell it opened up the arteries even bigger.
[00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.651]  He starts convulsing, he's drugged outside to die.
[00:14:00.692 --> 00:14:16.674]   And guaranteed, you know, Almost all these kids are liberal kids, their parents are liberal, and they really think it's safe to be in a blue city in a community as a white minority.
[00:14:17.054 --> 00:14:29.539]  And if you think it's safe to be a white minority in these blue cities where people think whites are inherently evil, whites are inherently bad, it's bad to be inherently white, CNN, MSNBC, the colleges teach.
[00:14:29.979 --> 00:14:30.900]  You hear it all over the place.
[00:14:31.702 --> 00:14:38.262]   the college heads, and then it becomes a sport to beat and kill and shoot and stab white people.
[00:14:38.262 --> 00:14:44.423]   It's very, very sad. Whether you are black or white or old or young or Hispanic or Asian,
[00:14:44.423 --> 00:14:49.541]   you need to identify with American flags that you're pro-freedom, anti-crime, and that you're
[00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:54.502]   anti-racist. And you need to get out of the blue cities, no matter what color you are.
[00:14:54.502 --> 00:14:59.143]   But anybody that's a leftist, I don't care if they're white, black, or whoever they are,
[00:14:59.143 --> 00:15:04.023]   You need to shun them, you need to stay away from them, and don't turn your backs on them.
[00:15:04.092 --> 00:15:06.215]  Because they are at war with you.
[00:15:08.396 --> 00:15:11.277]  I also see countless videos of innocent black men and women.
[00:15:12.017 --> 00:15:13.798]  I saw like three of them last week and put them on the list.
[00:15:13.838 --> 00:15:14.458]  I meant to get to them.
[00:15:14.478 --> 00:15:26.683]  In fact, guys, dig those clips out of just black men that go to work and have families get out of their cars and a group of black teens walk over and just shoot them in the back of the head and steal their computer back.
[00:15:28.804 --> 00:15:31.185]  And then they're given a couple of years in jail and let back out.
[00:15:31.225 --> 00:15:34.046]  So this scourge is attacking everybody.
[00:15:36.292 --> 00:15:41.135]  And it's extremely dangerous, and George Soros has literally been financing it.
[00:15:41.435 --> 00:15:54.462]  You can see the crime statistics where a black teenager rapes a woman, he gets six months in jail, beats her, and a white guy says the N-word and gets five years in prison, as if you can even do that.
[00:15:54.482 --> 00:15:56.182]  It's not even the law, but they still do it.
[00:15:57.403 --> 00:16:00.765]  And look, we have to understand this is going on.
[00:16:02.446 --> 00:16:03.026]  D.C.
[00:16:03.146 --> 00:16:04.187]  is unlivable now.
[00:16:05.057 --> 00:16:06.198]  Baltimore, unlivable.
[00:16:06.358 --> 00:16:07.759]  Chicago, unlivable.
[00:16:08.559 --> 00:16:09.620]  L.A., unlivable.
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.481]  San Francisco, unlivable.
[00:16:14.282 --> 00:16:16.403]  And by the way, it's not just black people acting like this.
[00:16:17.824 --> 00:16:28.310]  My cousin, not gonna say his last name, it's private family stuff, but my mom's first cousin's son, good friends with him.
[00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.411]  Big computer programmer with Microsoft, very successful.
[00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:34.413]  Lived in San Francisco.
[00:16:36.817 --> 00:16:44.899]  About 12, 13 years ago, he's walking outside of a restaurant and a homeless person asked for money.
[00:16:45.699 --> 00:16:46.259]  He gives him a 20.
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:54.981]  And I remember just asking before he died, he told me, what color was the person?
[00:16:55.041 --> 00:16:59.302]  It was a white homeless person, bit him on the hand for giving the other homeless person money.
[00:16:59.702 --> 00:17:01.983]  He got so infected, it caused a blood infection.
[00:17:03.737 --> 00:17:04.738]  And almost killed him.
[00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:08.281]  Ate his kidneys, ate his liver, and then it took him a few years to die from it.
[00:17:08.922 --> 00:17:11.704]  So, zombie level crime, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:12.805 --> 00:17:14.927]  My cousin, Jeffrey.
[00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:18.711]  Great guy, super smart.
[00:17:18.731 --> 00:17:22.154]  I remember fishing and hunting with him when I was a little kid.
[00:17:24.696 --> 00:17:25.117]  Bitten.
[00:17:27.739 --> 00:17:28.420]  And killed.
[00:17:29.358 --> 00:17:31.060]  By a blood infection by a homeless person.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.041]  Took him a few years to die.
[00:17:32.441 --> 00:17:35.023]  He survived the first thing and his organs failing.
[00:17:35.323 --> 00:17:36.665]  Bounced back, but died later.
[00:17:41.349 --> 00:17:46.273]  So, any blue city now, including Austin, Texas, people say, why are you still here?
[00:17:46.994 --> 00:17:48.655]  I don't have the money to move these studios.
[00:17:49.316 --> 00:17:52.359]  As soon as I do, I don't know where we're gonna move, what we're gonna do.
[00:17:52.379 --> 00:17:54.561]  It'll be hard to get the crew to move, but I bet they want to leave.
[00:17:56.007 --> 00:18:00.150]  And nowhere's perfect, but anyone that goes to downtown Austin is crazy.
[00:18:01.871 --> 00:18:04.172]  Anyone that goes to Northeast Austin is insane.
[00:18:08.415 --> 00:18:10.476]  And, all right, I'm ranting here.
[00:18:10.496 --> 00:18:11.356]  I'm already getting into this.
[00:18:12.297 --> 00:18:14.558]  Go ahead and roll the video with audio.
[00:18:15.239 --> 00:18:17.360]  And this is just tons of these videos every day.
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:18.401]  Standard deal.
[00:18:18.701 --> 00:18:20.062]  Stomp on somebody's head until they're dead.
[00:18:19.882 --> 00:18:37.481]   iridescent and they dragged his dragging out as he does from out the
[00:18:37.481 --> 00:18:42.378]   front door There he is, dying, bleeding out in the brain.
[00:18:44.439 --> 00:18:45.600]  And I tell you, shoot a video of it.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.080]  Upload it.
[00:18:50.143 --> 00:18:52.445]  No second order thinking.
[00:18:55.438 --> 00:18:56.639]  Hey, we just killed this guy.
[00:18:56.659 --> 00:18:57.419]  What's gonna happen to us?
[00:18:57.459 --> 00:18:58.479]  Probably six months in jail.
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.840]  That's up on Real Alex Jones.
[00:19:04.721 --> 00:19:10.742]  Now, here's a 35 year old black man executed coming home from work in Philadelphia last week.
[00:19:10.802 --> 00:19:13.003]  I got like three of these last week.
[00:19:13.163 --> 00:19:13.483]  Here it is.
[00:19:14.326 --> 00:19:18.270]  Northtown police say a man was leaving his friend's house to get something from his car.
[00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:26.717]  Security footage shows the moment three people step out of that grey Toyota RAV4, charge at the man, firing at least one shot.
[00:19:26.758 --> 00:19:33.784]  We were chilling in the house and we were literally sitting watching YouTube and stuff and he was like, he was like, what the f*** is that?
[00:19:33.864 --> 00:19:35.926]  He was like, we realized it was a gunshot.
[00:19:36.066 --> 00:19:39.770]  Officers found the victim, William Carter, lying on the sidewalk.
[00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.231]  The 35-year-old died at the scene.
[00:19:42.371 --> 00:19:52.234]  I never really officially met him, but from what his cousin says, he's a chill dude, getting his life right, working a steady job, all that.
[00:19:52.394 --> 00:19:54.855]  Neighbors made a memorial for Carter and his family.
[00:19:55.375 --> 00:20:01.096]  They say they hope people who have information about the three suspects will give it to those working the case.
[00:20:01.517 --> 00:20:05.598]  You're masked up, you got everything already, so what's the point of shooting?
[00:20:06.518 --> 00:20:08.339]  Yeah, that's another one of the reports I sent you last week.
[00:20:08.359 --> 00:20:11.021]  There's so many I can't keep track of them.
[00:20:11.061 --> 00:20:12.522]  But I'm gonna stop there.
[00:20:12.602 --> 00:20:13.803]  I'm gonna stop there.
[00:20:13.823 --> 00:20:14.483]  You know what I'm gonna do?
[00:20:14.503 --> 00:20:16.605]  I'm gonna start the next hour on this.
[00:20:16.464 --> 00:20:19.823]   do what she want with them and that would mess it up. Yeah that's another one of the
[00:20:19.823 --> 00:20:22.824]   reports I sent you last week there's so many I can't even drag them but I'm gonna stop
[00:20:22.824 --> 00:20:29.223]   there I'm gonna stop there you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna start the next
[00:20:29.223 --> 00:20:34.464]   hour on this and I'm gonna go back through it all very judiciously and I'm
[00:20:34.464 --> 00:20:38.343]   gonna show you what's going on and I skew of explaining that it's the CIA
[00:20:38.343 --> 00:20:50.495]   which it is And this is total weaponization where these fatherless people think it's cool to just kill people in cold blood.
[00:20:50.515 --> 00:21:01.020]  I mean, it's one thing you're going to rob somebody, but then the other video I sent last week, he gives them his computer bag and they just go ahead and shoot him right in the face and then shoot him once he hits the ground.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.561]  Don't even know this person.
[00:21:04.229 --> 00:21:05.770]  And you're just, black, white, doesn't matter.
[00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.831]  You're just killing them because it feels powerful.
[00:21:10.012 --> 00:21:12.493]  And these average juveniles, folks, are getting out in a couple years.
[00:21:13.733 --> 00:21:17.735]  And that's why everybody needs to have concealed carry.
[00:21:19.556 --> 00:21:23.338]  And that's why you need to watch your back because it's bad, folks.
[00:21:24.378 --> 00:21:28.040]  And nine times out of ten, it's black youth doing it.
[00:21:28.825 --> 00:21:33.944]   And then the rest of the time it's meth head, white trash people and MS-13.
[00:21:33.944 --> 00:21:41.183]   But I mean, yeah, and anybody knows what meth head, trashy people look like. You got a gas up at midnight on a
[00:21:41.183 --> 00:21:45.024]   business trip, you pull off in a bad area, some crackhead looking white
[00:21:45.024 --> 00:21:48.835]   dudes are like asking where you're going, what you're doing. You just simply sit there
[00:21:48.835 --> 00:21:52.605]   and get back in your car, where you got a gun, all the gas pumps. I mean, it's
[00:21:52.605 --> 00:21:53.144]  everywhere.
[00:21:53.356 --> 00:21:58.960]  But let's just admit it, though, that it's predominantly young black males, teenagers.
[00:22:00.161 --> 00:22:03.523]  And they're killing black people, white people, Hispanics, everybody.
[00:22:04.544 --> 00:22:06.765]  And the government is trying to suppress the crime statistics.
[00:22:07.526 --> 00:22:08.947]  In fact, it started three years ago.
[00:22:09.347 --> 00:22:14.391]  Well, it's been a while, but they completely suppressed all the major cities of the U.S.
[00:22:14.431 --> 00:22:15.992]  The FBI just doesn't release the numbers, no.
[00:22:16.012 --> 00:22:19.314]  Well, this is the summer of love, folks.
[00:22:21.428 --> 00:22:29.195]  And then you got Antifa running around a bunch of meth-head college professors and people just randomly shooting any white person they see driving a big truck.
[00:22:29.635 --> 00:22:30.716]  Oh, you're white and driving a truck.
[00:22:30.736 --> 00:22:31.517]  We're just gonna shoot you.
[00:22:31.737 --> 00:22:36.962]  How many dozens of people got shot in their trucks because they were white by Antifa?
[00:22:37.622 --> 00:22:40.445]  And there's this attitude of everybody deserves to die.
[00:22:40.905 --> 00:22:41.406]  It's sick.
[00:22:43.608 --> 00:22:53.437]   All right, I'm gonna table that until I start next hour and I'm going to get into the whole background on it, how it's working and how we stop it.
[00:22:54.798 --> 00:23:02.040]  But the first thing is you've got to understand that the CIA didn't just finance the gangster rap.
[00:23:03.261 --> 00:23:18.366]  The CIA also shipped in the cocaine and the crack recipe to absolutely use black communities as a bomb to not just blow them up, but blow everybody up.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:27.944]  I was growing up in Dallas in the 80s, and I remember 10, 15 homicides a day in the crack epidemic.
[00:23:28.504 --> 00:23:38.629]  And I remember being in high school before we moved down here my last couple years, and good friends of mine, white, black, you name it, we'd say, well, where did Marcos go?
[00:23:38.689 --> 00:23:39.690]  Or where did Sean go?
[00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.311]  Oh, they're crackheads now in downtown Dallas.
[00:23:44.224 --> 00:23:46.685]  And I knew cheerleaders and people that were from good families.
[00:23:47.565 --> 00:23:48.266]  Oh, where's Lucy?
[00:23:48.306 --> 00:23:49.386]  Oh, she's a crackhead now.
[00:23:49.406 --> 00:23:50.146]  She's a crack whore.
[00:23:52.427 --> 00:24:03.372]  And the black people I knew, who were doing well and working jobs and stuff, their mothers literally locked them in their house, other than their job or football.
[00:24:03.892 --> 00:24:11.735]  And then if we were going to the mall or something, because I had a lot of black friends, the mother would go with us and follow us around.
[00:24:12.976 --> 00:24:13.716]  Because they had to.
[00:24:16.284 --> 00:24:18.647]  And that's the way it is for everybody now.
[00:24:18.847 --> 00:24:19.768]  It's always been that way.
[00:24:20.368 --> 00:24:25.734]  You cannot just sit there and turn your children loose in this culture, or they're gonna get killed.
[00:24:28.216 --> 00:24:34.062]  And I got a bunch of examples that we didn't get to, new ones, that I'm gonna explain next hour.
[00:24:35.483 --> 00:24:35.764]  All right.
[00:24:36.772 --> 00:24:41.535]  Let me tell you what's coming up though and I gotta move quick because a lot of this I've been talking to you yesterday and I didn't and it's huge.
[00:24:41.835 --> 00:24:44.117]  Ted Rose has come out and admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:24:44.157 --> 00:24:45.578]  That's the UNWHO head.
[00:24:45.998 --> 00:24:49.120]  That is a huge video and a huge report.
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.643]  I want to read you from the UN Charter how they're able to commit crimes and get away with it.
[00:24:53.543 --> 00:24:57.386]  Also, this video has gone mega viral.
[00:24:58.006 --> 00:24:59.527]  We've got the background from it in Congress.
[00:24:59.567 --> 00:25:00.368]  It's all confirmed.
[00:25:00.387 --> 00:25:08.867]   Nevada state senator testifies to the US Senate, but 130,000 people voted illegally in the
[00:25:08.867 --> 00:25:10.746]  state and none of them went to jail.
[00:25:10.746 --> 00:25:11.746]  That was in the 2020 election.
[00:25:11.746 --> 00:25:16.067]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:25:16.067 --> 00:25:18.667]  Also Nikki Haley has been caught in new giant lies.
[00:25:18.667 --> 00:25:24.426]   This woman even out of a cast of criminals in DC, she's one of the worst, which says
[00:25:24.426 --> 00:25:26.028]  a lot.
[00:25:26.028 --> 00:25:32.387]  You've also got kill switches.
[00:25:32.387 --> 00:25:34.268]  You've heard kill switches already in all the cars.
[00:25:34.775 --> 00:25:39.644]  But they lied and said, oh, it's just to monitor you, just to make sure you're safe.
[00:25:40.025 --> 00:25:41.627]  Now they admit it's for carbon taxes.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.883]  And for tracking you and they're going to control how fast you can drive your car.
[00:25:46.343 --> 00:25:47.684]  ABC News cast on that.
[00:25:47.704 --> 00:25:49.986]  We're going to be getting to all of that.
[00:25:50.006 --> 00:25:57.914]  Of course, we knew this at the time, but Trudeau's government used fake intelligence to identify and frame protesting truckers as violent extremists.
[00:25:58.334 --> 00:26:02.018]  Some are still in jail who were totally nonviolent two years later.
[00:26:05.461 --> 00:26:07.843]  New documents have been released for your lawsuits.
[00:26:07.903 --> 00:26:09.264]  Soros behind all of it.
[00:26:09.844 --> 00:26:15.928]  Defeat MAGA, Radical Left Network has taken over the Democratic Party and are committing all sorts of crimes.
[00:26:15.948 --> 00:26:20.651]  They don't just control judges and DAs, but they control all sorts of criminal operators.
[00:26:21.271 --> 00:26:22.652]  It is a takeover.
[00:26:22.772 --> 00:26:24.193]  Remember, this guy overthrows countries.
[00:26:24.994 --> 00:26:25.954]  He's a CIA front.
[00:26:25.995 --> 00:26:26.895]  That's what he does.
[00:26:27.596 --> 00:26:29.377]  We've got all of that news.
[00:26:31.018 --> 00:26:33.940]  And we've got articles like this every few days.
[00:26:35.369 --> 00:26:37.992]  And I need to get to them, but I just, it's so horrific.
[00:26:38.032 --> 00:26:41.355]  I don't, they got surveillance video out of Dallas showing it.
[00:26:41.495 --> 00:26:42.456]  This is how dangerous it is.
[00:26:44.778 --> 00:26:50.484]  Seven men gang rape two toddlers in a shopping mall restroom and post the video online.
[00:26:53.747 --> 00:26:55.709]  But the media is defending it saying, well, they're gay.
[00:26:55.829 --> 00:26:56.950]  So I'm not kidding.
[00:26:58.522 --> 00:26:59.823]  So, uh, there you go.
[00:26:59.843 --> 00:27:02.324]  I mean, just the pedos can't even control themselves anymore.
[00:27:02.925 --> 00:27:06.267]  They're just gang raping babies in bathrooms in Dallas.
[00:27:06.507 --> 00:27:08.108]  By the way, Dallas is dangerous as hell.
[00:27:09.449 --> 00:27:12.410]  I see the local news from there a lot because I'm just south of there, you know?
[00:27:13.031 --> 00:27:15.572]  And it never hits the national news other than shows like this that get it out.
[00:27:16.012 --> 00:27:24.177]  And you'll read like, seven-year-old girl kidnapped out of backyard, found three months later in Dallas being raped by 100 plus men a day.
[00:27:24.397 --> 00:27:25.098]  And you're like, what?
[00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:39.138]  Or another girl kidnapped while at the Mavericks game, 10, found months later in Oklahoma City hotel room being raped by hundreds of men.
[00:27:39.278 --> 00:27:41.179]  I mean, it's just a little blurb, like, okay.
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.261]  I mean, it's dangerous as hell, people.
[00:27:45.662 --> 00:27:47.323]  The crime statistics are now secret.
[00:27:47.604 --> 00:27:51.827]  Before they made them secret three years ago, 22 to 1 black on white crime.
[00:27:51.847 --> 00:27:53.648]  Can you imagine what it is now?
[00:27:55.728 --> 00:28:00.974]  That's because they defunded the police and let that small group of violent young black people out of jail.
[00:28:01.174 --> 00:28:03.336]  But they're letting the pedos out that rape kids.
[00:28:03.376 --> 00:28:05.278]  They're white, black, you name it.
[00:28:05.678 --> 00:28:13.206]  It's just every evil group, from MS-13 to you name it, has been greenlit to act however they want, whenever they want.
[00:28:13.226 --> 00:28:16.350]  And then you're told by the FBI, the number one threat is white people.
[00:28:17.745 --> 00:28:19.225]  I'm not here about laying blame on any group.
[00:28:19.265 --> 00:28:24.667]  I'm just saying the idea that white people are the number one criminals this country is a load of bullshit.
[00:28:25.107 --> 00:28:34.610]  Media matters, the Democratic Party, MSNBC and others have asked me to apologize for making a parody video game criticizing the deep state and all the corruption.
[00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.090]  And to all them, I just want to say this.
[00:28:37.971 --> 00:28:39.151]  Go f*** yourselves.
[00:28:40.923 --> 00:28:47.228]  Alex Jones New World Order Wars has been number one on Steam thanks to the viewers and listeners of this broadcast.
[00:28:47.568 --> 00:29:00.780]  And I want to invite everyone, before they are successful at banning, which I hope they aren't, to go to alexjonesgame.com and follow the link to Steam and download this game for $17.76 as a message to the New World Order.
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:01.960]  F*** you!
[00:29:02.501 --> 00:29:10.506]  You want to try to ban this game just like you want to steal elections and force injections on us and open up our borders and rape us.
[00:29:10.926 --> 00:29:14.908]  This is a culture war and they're scared of this game.
[00:29:15.308 --> 00:29:24.114]  Get Alex Jones' New World Order Wars right now at AlexJonesGame.com because anything badass gets censored!
[00:29:25.014 --> 00:29:27.476]  The Democratic Party is a criminal organization.
[00:29:28.976 --> 00:29:31.078]  They know the public is turning against them.
[00:29:32.159 --> 00:29:34.302]  They know humanity is waking up, so they're desperate.
[00:29:35.563 --> 00:29:43.832]  And they are intending to run the exact same scams they used to steal the 2020 and steal quite a bit of the 2022 midterm election.
[00:29:43.852 --> 00:29:50.659]  That was a giant landslide for Republicans, but as you know, they barely got any gains because the same scams, the same fraud was used.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:58.046]  The Democratic Party all over the country has legalized illegal aliens getting driver's license and voting in local elections.
[00:29:58.066 --> 00:30:04.391]  Well, the local elections are almost always on the federal and state election dates as well on the same ballot.
[00:30:04.431 --> 00:30:06.313]  There are a few local elections that aren't.
[00:30:07.954 --> 00:30:10.556]  And now Democrats go, well of course illegals should be able to vote.
[00:30:11.717 --> 00:30:27.444]   So what they have is NGOs at the polling places in key states like Nevada, And Georgia, and Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Arizona, signing them up right there to go in and vote.
[00:30:27.844 --> 00:30:32.049]  And if you get a driver's license in any of those states, you get put on the voter rolls.
[00:30:32.629 --> 00:30:36.373]  Now, the worst state is Nevada.
[00:30:36.653 --> 00:30:39.877]  Nevada is a very Republican conservative state historically.
[00:30:40.885 --> 00:30:42.706]  But not since the Democrats get control.
[00:30:42.746 --> 00:30:47.887]  They ever get control, even of a few jurisdictions, they expand their fraud out from there.
[00:30:48.828 --> 00:30:54.069]  So here's a Congressional Senate hearing with James Lankford of Oklahoma, the U.S.
[00:30:54.109 --> 00:31:06.532]   Senator, interviewing a Nevada State Senator, and I did some investigation into this, and the thread on real Alex Jones, this has about 4 million views right now, Is invaluable.
[00:31:06.572 --> 00:31:24.224]  I spent like an hour on it last night, an hour this morning, and I printed a bunch of it off, and there's news articles and links and people testifying and local election testimony, where people will get five ballots at their home, is one example, and they go to the polling place and say, I got five ballots.
[00:31:24.244 --> 00:31:25.665]  They go, well, what's your name?
[00:31:25.705 --> 00:31:26.606]  It shows you've already voted.
[00:31:28.847 --> 00:31:30.829]  And that's just when they send it to the wrong address.
[00:31:31.309 --> 00:31:35.779]   They have cases of thousands of people voting, From one address.
[00:31:38.281 --> 00:31:40.782]  And that's what Ginesse D'Souza found in 2000 Mules.
[00:31:40.802 --> 00:31:42.524]  He just picked a few states and a few cities.
[00:31:44.425 --> 00:31:46.567]  Like Pennsylvania and others where this is going on.
[00:31:47.888 --> 00:31:48.388]  And Maryland.
[00:31:49.409 --> 00:31:52.611]  And he went and bought the cell phone data from the cell phone companies that anybody can do.
[00:31:54.492 --> 00:32:07.992]   And had the computer program to show thousands of people per city, day after day, week after week during early voting, going to safe houses, getting their ballots, hundreds of
[00:32:07.992 --> 00:32:12.932]   people going to the house, hundreds going out to different drop boxes, and then they even got
[00:32:12.932 --> 00:32:20.972]   the surveillance footage of them putting the dozens, in some cases hundreds, of ballots
[00:32:20.972 --> 00:32:23.051]  into the drop box.
[00:32:23.051 --> 00:32:24.612]  So this is how they're doing it.
[00:32:24.612 --> 00:32:28.133]  And they've got other ways to do it as well.
[00:32:28.133 --> 00:32:30.252]  So here is the viral clip.
[00:32:30.252 --> 00:32:37.812]   42,000 people in Nevada voted more than once, according to your work in this.
[00:32:37.851 --> 00:32:38.152]  42,000 people.
[00:32:38.973 --> 00:32:42.036]  1,500 people voted in Nevada that were dead.
[00:32:42.056 --> 00:32:48.344]  19,000 people voted though they did not live in Nevada and they weren't a college student.
[00:32:50.246 --> 00:33:01.688]  8,000 people voted from a non-existent address, 15,000 people voted though they were registered to a commercial address or a vacant address, and 4,000 people voted in Nevada that are non-citizens.
[00:33:02.348 --> 00:33:14.991]  My question to you is, in my state, when someone votes twice, and we do have that occasionally, about 50 times a year that that actually occurs in our state, we prosecute individuals that vote twice.
[00:33:15.991 --> 00:33:26.627]  Of this 130,000 instances that you have identified from the 2020 election in Nevada, do you know of any prosecutions currently going on in Nevada for any voter fraud?
[00:33:28.008 --> 00:33:30.112]  Not yet, Senator, and that's extremely important.
[00:33:31.417 --> 00:33:33.420]  And by the way, we're going to go on the C-SPAN website.
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:38.125]  You can just search the name Jesse Bunnell, the state senator in Nevada, and you can get the full hearing.
[00:33:38.145 --> 00:33:44.073]  I actually found some larger clubs, so we're going to be getting to those here coming up later in the broadcast.
[00:33:44.693 --> 00:33:49.459]  But they're not just stealing at the ballot box and on election day or in the months before.
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:34:01.821]  They're doing it by censoring conservative news, 96% Google results back to Democrats, blocking stories like the Hunter laptop and thousands of others that expose their corruption.
[00:34:03.653 --> 00:34:17.519]  And, trying to take, successfully in many cases, Republican incumbents off the ballot, or having them indicted for nothing by the Justice Department, and of course indicting Trump, and admitting, even Biden said, so that he can't run for office.
[00:34:17.539 --> 00:34:20.620]  But despite that, he's not giving up, and people see right through it.
[00:34:21.361 --> 00:34:28.844]  Another way they do it is, financing Nikki Haley, who spends four times as much, on average, as Trump does, in the primaries per vote.
[00:34:29.858 --> 00:34:41.448]  With all the big billionaires and all the big Soros cash going right to her, and then the media defending her and not pointing out what a neocon warmongering liar she is.
[00:34:41.748 --> 00:34:53.178]  There's a lot of these compilations out there, but here's one of the shorter ones that shows her before and after, in some cases just weeks apart, lying to people.
[00:34:53.218 --> 00:34:53.559]  Here it is.
[00:34:54.946 --> 00:34:55.768]  And we will get them.
[00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:02.125]  But I will not, not now, not ever, support raising the gas tax.
[00:35:03.712 --> 00:35:08.473]  Finally, let's increase the gas tax by 10 cents over the next three years.
[00:35:08.673 --> 00:35:11.054]  I would not run if President Trump ran.
[00:35:11.254 --> 00:35:13.774]  I'm Nikki Haley and I'm running for President.
[00:35:13.914 --> 00:35:17.915]  Every person on social media should be verified by their name.
[00:35:18.235 --> 00:35:21.436]  I never said government should go and require anyone's name.
[00:35:21.516 --> 00:35:25.877]  But what we do know is 65 is way too low and we need to increase that.
[00:35:25.897 --> 00:35:29.017]  Proclaiming the retirement age is quote way way too low.
[00:35:29.097 --> 00:35:31.538]  I have never once said that.
[00:35:32.518 --> 00:35:35.059]  I never said Hillary Clinton was an inspiration.
[00:35:35.239 --> 00:35:40.642]  I went with my friend Eleanor Kitzman to a firm and leadership program where Hillary Clinton was speaking.
[00:35:41.242 --> 00:35:44.083]  And I walked out of there and I said, I'm running for office.
[00:35:45.684 --> 00:35:47.225]  So Hillary Clinton's her inspiration.
[00:35:47.245 --> 00:35:49.526]  We're going to go to break in about three minutes.
[00:35:49.626 --> 00:35:51.147]  I'm going to come back and get into key U.N.
[00:35:53.018 --> 00:35:58.501]  Health care, pandemic treaty, intel that ties into the censorship that control what they're planning.
[00:35:58.541 --> 00:36:05.346]  I want to show you the UN's charter from 1946 that's still in place to talk about what their global endgame is.
[00:36:05.386 --> 00:36:07.587]  This is key information coming up.

[00:36:32.279 --> 00:36:39.125]  And we've got a special that's going to end on Wednesday, because DNA Force Plus is about to sell out, maybe even earlier.
[00:36:40.199 --> 00:36:43.622]  DNA Force Plus and Real Red Pill Plus are both close to selling out.
[00:36:44.123 --> 00:36:45.444]  DNA Force Plus a lot closer.
[00:36:45.484 --> 00:36:46.405]  It's our flagship product.
[00:36:46.785 --> 00:36:50.889]  Despite that, it's 50% off.
[00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:57.235]  50% off for DNA Force Plus and Real Red Pill Plus when you get them together, or 40% individually.
[00:36:57.395 --> 00:36:58.936]  Also, at the warehouse in Denver.
[00:36:59.801 --> 00:37:00.842]  I got the news Friday.
[00:37:01.543 --> 00:37:07.690]  They had half a pallet of X2 that won't be back in stock until April or May, our number one product.
[00:37:08.191 --> 00:37:12.176]  They found half a pallet, 520-something bottles.
[00:37:13.077 --> 00:37:14.899]  We don't even need to plug that to sell it, but...
[00:37:16.294 --> 00:37:20.135]  I'm letting listeners know, a small amount of X2 now available at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.420]  This is beyond energy.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.241]  It isn't like a stimulant that stimulates you.
[00:37:41.261 --> 00:37:42.581]  It's a totally different way it does it.

[00:38:47.246 --> 00:38:51.147]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, the last segment of hour number one.
[00:38:51.467 --> 00:38:54.488]  Three more hours coming up ahead of the War Room, 3 p.m.
[00:38:54.528 --> 00:38:56.989]  Central, with the amazing Owen Schroeder.
[00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:00.490]  All right, let me break down the facts here.
[00:39:01.511 --> 00:39:05.292]  I'm about to lay out a very brief but accurate history.
[00:39:06.874 --> 00:39:08.595]  The British Empire, merging with the U.S.
[00:39:08.655 --> 00:39:11.117]  Empire after World War I, wanted a global government.
[00:39:11.777 --> 00:39:13.318]  They set up the League of Nations, but it failed.
[00:39:13.839 --> 00:39:28.249]  After World War II, they set up the United Nations, so they could transfer national sovereignty from countries that had voters and populations that had rights, like England, like Scotland, like Ireland, like the U.S., like Germany, like France.
[00:39:29.998 --> 00:39:43.143]  Into the United Nations and then have their politicians and leaders graduate into that global government and have diplomatic immunity and be able to engage in human trafficking, drug dealing, any type of scam you can imagine.
[00:39:43.163 --> 00:39:47.244]  I'm going to go into the UN's charter here in just a moment.
[00:39:49.785 --> 00:39:54.406]  So let's go ahead and lay some of this out and just give you an example of this.
[00:39:55.667 --> 00:40:11.974]   Friday Tedros of the UN WHO, the head of it, came out and said, oh, there's these terrible conspiracy theories everywhere that the UN treaty that we've read you the subsections of takes over your sovereignty.
[00:40:11.994 --> 00:40:15.475]  He goes, no, your countries are writing it and ratifying it with us.
[00:40:16.095 --> 00:40:16.995]  They wouldn't do that.
[00:40:18.376 --> 00:40:22.478]  Well, no, they're trying to create these treaties that are then binding.
[00:40:23.878 --> 00:40:28.500]  And the idea that because our governments ratify these, there's no way there's tyranny in them.
[00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:30.631]  That's preposterous.
[00:40:32.133 --> 00:40:36.498]  Just because a government signs on to something, doesn't then mean it's okay.
[00:40:37.599 --> 00:40:45.849]  Like they're trying to do to ban cows, and gasoline cars, and gas stoves, and the nuclear family, and the word mother and father, husband and wife.
[00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.894]  This is all out of the UN, out of this global government.
[00:40:51.169 --> 00:40:52.350]  But you saw the U.N.
[00:40:53.071 --> 00:40:54.372]  You heard it during the lockdowns.
[00:40:54.492 --> 00:40:55.312]  Oh, the U.N.
[00:40:55.372 --> 00:40:56.874]  says we're in a global emergency.
[00:40:56.894 --> 00:40:57.414]  The U.N.
[00:40:57.474 --> 00:40:59.376]  says we need to lock things down.
[00:41:00.377 --> 00:41:01.057]  Oh, the U.N.
[00:41:01.117 --> 00:41:02.819]  says we got to stay six feet apart.
[00:41:02.859 --> 00:41:03.359]  The U.N.
[00:41:03.419 --> 00:41:06.341]  says vitamin D3 doesn't help against viruses.
[00:41:06.702 --> 00:41:07.182]  The U.N.
[00:41:07.222 --> 00:41:08.383]  says vitamin C doesn't help.
[00:41:08.723 --> 00:41:09.144]  The U.N.
[00:41:09.184 --> 00:41:11.526]  says hydroxychloroquine isn't good.
[00:41:12.665 --> 00:41:30.231]  So, the UN itself is a consortium of these big megabanks, and our own government's transferring power over to it, and here's Tedros, desperately trying to rally the UN at the General Assembly, saying, we need you to get in there and censor these people and shut them down, because they're lying about us.
[00:41:30.311 --> 00:41:37.193]  No, everything they told us was a lie, about it not coming out of the lab, and how the vaccine was going to protect us, and all of that.
[00:41:38.674 --> 00:41:39.074]  Here he is.
[00:41:40.706 --> 00:41:53.910]  If the final products do not change the status quo, and if they do not help to ensure collective security and equity, then we will have missed our chance to make history.
[00:41:55.191 --> 00:42:05.191]  This work is not easy.
[00:42:05.458 --> 00:42:20.743]  That guy sitting right next to him, the white guy, is Dr. Ryan, the head of the UN's Global Emergency Response Force, who has the governments everywhere video him saying, we're going to lock you down, we're going to arrest people that disagree with us, we're going to take children from the families, we're going to forcibly inject everyone.
[00:42:23.224 --> 00:42:25.825]  You all heard the UN was in charge during their pandemic.
[00:42:25.845 --> 00:42:28.445]  I just want to point that out.
[00:42:28.826 --> 00:42:29.626]  Let's go back to Tedros.
[00:42:30.333 --> 00:42:36.936]  security and equity, then we will have missed our chance to make history.
[00:42:38.437 --> 00:42:43.959]  This work is not easy and it's occurring in a very difficult environment.
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:54.304]  The IMB and the IHR working group are operating amid a torrent of fake news, lies and conspiracy theories.
[00:42:56.598 --> 00:43:09.982]  There are those who claim that the pandemic agreement and IHR will cede sovereignty to WHO and give the WHO Secretariat the power to impose lockdowns or vaccine mandates on countries.
[00:43:12.462 --> 00:43:16.103]  You know this is fake news, lies and conspiracy theories.
[00:43:18.284 --> 00:43:20.504]  You know these claims are completely false.
[00:43:21.905 --> 00:43:25.466]  You know that the agreement will give WHO no such powers.
[00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:28.445]  Because you are writing it.
[00:43:30.927 --> 00:43:42.435]  We cannot allow this historic agreement, this milestone in global health to be sabotaged by those who spread lies, either deliberately or unknowingly.
[00:43:44.077 --> 00:43:46.619]  We need your support to counter these lies.
[00:43:48.069 --> 00:44:00.112]  By speaking up at home and telling your citizens that this agreement and an amended IHR will not and cannot cede sovereignty to WHO and that it belongs to the Member States.
[00:44:02.212 --> 00:44:04.453]  The reality is quite the opposite.
[00:44:06.073 --> 00:44:12.175]  You're safeguarding national sovereignty while strengthening global health security.
[00:44:13.435 --> 00:44:16.656]  Those two things are not mutually exclusive.
[00:44:17.731 --> 00:44:19.452]  It's not a zero-sum game.
[00:44:20.994 --> 00:44:33.263]  The agreement is negotiated by countries, for countries, and will be implemented in countries in accordance with your own national laws.
[00:44:35.705 --> 00:44:39.368]  Maybe we should play Dr. Ryan, saying we're going to have the UN come in and take your kids.
[00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:42.931]  We all just saw what they did.
[00:44:44.474 --> 00:44:45.875]  Oh, he's like, your countries are writing it.
[00:44:45.975 --> 00:44:50.697]  Yeah, Obama's former COVID czar, they admit, is the guy writing all this globally.
[00:44:51.357 --> 00:45:04.403]  Now there's Michael J. Ryan, the head of the Global UN Emergency Directive, Health Emergencies Program, saying, and I'll play that in a second, but let's do this, okay?
[00:45:05.383 --> 00:45:08.784]  Here is the UN's website, okay?
[00:45:10.265 --> 00:45:10.965]  And here's their 1946 charter.
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:17.184]  And I don't know if I can even do this in the time we have here, but I suggest everybody go read this.
[00:45:17.644 --> 00:45:28.754]  It says they've got immunity from every crime under the sun, they're immune from taxes, regulations, but they can tax and control you, and their job is to take over national sovereignty and establish a world government.
[00:45:29.054 --> 00:45:36.921]  Go read the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations adopted by the General Assembly on the United Nations on February 13, 1946.
[00:45:39.755 --> 00:45:47.640]  Whereas Article 104 of the Charter of the United Nations provides the organization shall enjoy the territory of each of its members... Oh, the territory of each of its members.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:46:01.449]  Such legal capacity as many be necessary for the exercise and the functions and the fulfillment of its purposes and... Whereas Article 105 of the Charter of the United Nations provides that the organization shall enjoy the territory of each member's such privileges...
[00:46:02.129 --> 00:46:17.337]  ...and immunities are necessary for fulfillment and purposes of the representation of the members of the United Nations and officials at the organization shall similarly enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the organization."
[00:46:17.577 --> 00:46:21.359]  Remember, they wouldn't sign on to give the illegal aliens they control the shots.
[00:46:21.399 --> 00:46:22.340]  They said it was too dangerous.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.560]  That's only for you.
[00:46:25.161 --> 00:46:36.679]   Consequently, the General Assembly, by the resolution adopted on the 13th of February, 1946, Approved by the following convention and provided in the Ascension by the member of the United Nations.
[00:46:36.819 --> 00:46:37.460]  The Ascension.
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:39.380]  Section 1.
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:43.181]  The United Nations shall possess judiciary personality.
[00:46:43.241 --> 00:46:52.803]  It shall have the capacity to contact, to acquire and dispose of immovable and movable property to institute legal proceedings.
[00:46:53.144 --> 00:46:53.724]  Article 2.
[00:46:53.864 --> 00:46:54.204]  Section 2.
[00:46:54.924 --> 00:47:08.237]  The United Nations, its property and its assets, wherever located and by whoever held, shall enjoy immunity from every form of legal process except as so far as any particular case, and be expressly waived by its immunity.
[00:47:08.257 --> 00:47:09.037]  So they're above the law.
[00:47:09.538 --> 00:47:15.183]  It is, however, understood that no waiver of immunity shall extend to any measure of execution.
[00:47:16.485 --> 00:47:17.105]  Section 3.
[00:47:17.465 --> 00:47:19.948]  The premise of the United Nations shall be inviolate.
[00:47:21.479 --> 00:47:22.280]  Means they're above the law.
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:28.505]  The property and assets of the United Nations, wherever located, and wherever so held, shall be amused.
[00:47:28.525 --> 00:47:29.586]  That means anybody that works with them.
[00:47:29.806 --> 00:47:39.435]  From search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation, or any other form of interference, whether by executive, administrative, judicial, or legislative action.
[00:47:39.835 --> 00:47:42.297]  Your country can't do anything to it, even if they're in your country.
[00:47:42.758 --> 00:47:43.118]  Section 4.
[00:47:43.759 --> 00:47:51.059]   The Archives of the United Nations and, in general, all documents belonging to it are held by it and shall be Inviolable wherever located.
[00:47:51.259 --> 00:47:51.619]  Section 5.
[00:47:52.339 --> 00:47:58.222]  Without being required by financial controls, regulations, or moratoria of any kind.
[00:47:59.123 --> 00:48:00.743]  That's just like the Federal Reserve has the same power.
[00:48:02.124 --> 00:48:04.325]  But guys, pull up the classic clip a minute and a half long.
[00:48:04.465 --> 00:48:05.445]  I'm going to the next hour with this.
[00:48:08.547 --> 00:48:15.090]  Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on PBS says, Alan Greenspan says, Federal Reserve by the law.
[00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:22.135]  United Nations may hold funds, gold, currency of any kind for operate accounts in any currency.
[00:48:22.535 --> 00:48:23.557]  You gotta read the rest of it.
[00:48:25.018 --> 00:48:33.229]  It just gets worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and they're individual personnel.
[00:48:34.932 --> 00:48:35.532]  Are above the law.
[00:48:35.552 --> 00:48:37.153]  I'm going to play you, Dr. Ryan.
[00:48:37.173 --> 00:48:44.936]  I'm going to play you, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan, because does our government have total immunity from crime in our Constitution?
[00:48:44.996 --> 00:48:45.137]  No.
[00:48:45.557 --> 00:48:46.017]  They do.
[00:48:46.457 --> 00:48:52.260]  They set up a new form of government that's an old form that's tyranny to then transfer all the power over to them.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:49:01.904]  And now they have almost all the prosecutors on Jack Smith's kangaroo operation are current UN war crimes prosecutors, including Jack Smith.
[00:49:03.211 --> 00:49:04.692]  All right, hour number two straight ahead.
[00:49:04.712 --> 00:49:13.140]  I'm going to hit all this, then I'll get into the CIA behind gangster rap and the race war and their master plan and how to stop them.
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.202]  You don't want to miss hour number two straight ahead.
[00:49:16.603 --> 00:49:17.784]  Infowars.com.
[00:49:17.844 --> 00:49:19.085]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:49:19.765 --> 00:49:20.005]  Listen.
[00:49:20.806 --> 00:49:21.407]  I need your help.
[00:49:21.747 --> 00:49:23.148]  I mean, have we not delivered?
[00:49:23.188 --> 00:49:24.390]  It's like a gladiator.
[00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:27.272]  When he first is a gladiator, he kills like four guys in 20 seconds.
[00:49:27.312 --> 00:49:28.473]  He says, are you not entertained?
[00:49:28.994 --> 00:49:32.057]  I mean, are you not getting what you want?
[00:49:32.577 --> 00:49:34.919]  Because, I mean, I eat, drink, and sleep this.
[00:49:34.999 --> 00:49:38.523]  I'm up against the New World Order, and all I need is your support.
[00:49:38.903 --> 00:49:45.711]  All I need is your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, and I sell you stuff that's the highest rated, the best, because I treat you like I want to be treated.
[00:49:45.971 --> 00:49:51.918]  I believe in mojo, karma, reap what you sow, folks, and you need to go to infowarestore.com.
[00:49:51.958 --> 00:49:53.199]  You need to make the decision.
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:59.204]  To go to InfoWarsTore.com and get incredible products.
[00:49:59.224 --> 00:50:04.008]  We have the Supercharged Special right now, despite the fact that both these best-selling products are selling out.
[00:50:04.388 --> 00:50:12.614]  DNA Force Plus and Real Red Pill Plus are both selling out, but despite that, they're 50% off as a combo.
[00:50:12.995 --> 00:50:16.217]  The Supercharged Special at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:50:16.397 --> 00:50:20.821]   Please go to InfoWarsTore.com, and while you're there, It's about to sell out, but it's okay.
[00:50:20.841 --> 00:50:21.482]  We did a limited run.
[00:50:21.522 --> 00:50:24.766]  Now that it's going to sell out, we can order a bigger order of it.
[00:50:24.786 --> 00:50:29.771]  We're building back to be able to, you know, not just stay the same, but expand in the enemy space.
[00:50:30.072 --> 00:50:30.833]  That's up to you, though.
[00:50:30.873 --> 00:50:33.576]  You have to make the decision to say, has InfoWars delivered?
[00:50:34.096 --> 00:50:35.657]  Zinfowars on the air seven days a week.
[00:50:35.737 --> 00:50:36.857]  Is Jones wild?
[00:50:37.217 --> 00:50:38.058]  Is he dedicated?
[00:50:38.098 --> 00:50:38.918]  Has he told us the truth?
[00:50:39.178 --> 00:50:40.698]  The answer is, I've died trying.
[00:50:41.259 --> 00:50:42.179]  I ain't perfect, man.
[00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:43.980]  If I'm lying, I'm dying.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:50.722]  I'm all about what is the most accurate, what is the most cutting edge, what is, who do I have on, people that predict the future, that are accurate.
[00:50:50.982 --> 00:50:52.903]  You can get next level foundational energy.
[00:50:53.991 --> 00:51:06.944]  Next Level Foundational Energy that supercharges your cells, take an hour to explain it, but this takes folic acid and puts it into the pure form methylfolate that is the essence of your cells and it's got to be complex to supercharge it.

[00:51:16.333 --> 00:51:17.374]  The ball is in your court.
[00:51:19.577 --> 00:51:20.458]  All right, welcome back.
[00:51:20.498 --> 00:51:21.478]  Hour number two.
[00:51:21.598 --> 00:51:26.301]  Some stations don't carry this first five, so I'm going to hit some really key intel on the poison shot.
[00:51:27.061 --> 00:51:30.203]  Then we'll come back with the whole UN power grab and how to stop them.
[00:51:30.243 --> 00:51:32.924]  And then I should be done by about 15 after.
[00:51:33.484 --> 00:51:41.509]  I'm going to get into the big enchilada, a great window in the New World Order, how the CIA took over the black community and basically every other community next.
[00:51:41.569 --> 00:51:44.931]  But they picked black folks first, as they always do.
[00:51:46.011 --> 00:51:47.772]  It's a serious situation, so that's coming up.
[00:51:47.792 --> 00:51:51.233]  But Cheryl Atkinson, top investigative journalist, has done a great job.
[00:51:51.273 --> 00:51:52.834]  The full video is up on Infowars.com.
[00:51:53.014 --> 00:51:54.894]  I'm going to repost it on X as well.
[00:51:54.934 --> 00:51:55.715]  It's a 10-minute report.
[00:51:55.995 --> 00:51:56.635]  But here's part of it.
[00:51:57.095 --> 00:51:59.376]  We're now, because she's on national TV all over the country.
[00:51:59.516 --> 00:52:01.497]  She reaches 43 million households.
[00:52:01.517 --> 00:52:10.800]  So this is one of the first times on national news that former CBS top investigative journalist, that this is actually getting out there.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.621]  So it's pretty amazing.
[00:52:11.661 --> 00:52:11.941]  Here it is.
[00:52:13.581 --> 00:52:14.622]  Welcome to Full Measure.
[00:52:14.802 --> 00:52:15.743]  I'm Cheryl Atkinson.
[00:52:16.624 --> 00:52:26.392]  Florida's Surgeon General recently called for a halt in COVID vaccines due to safety questions, while the federal government continues to heavily promote them for adults and kids alike.
[00:52:26.973 --> 00:52:31.256]  Today, we begin with a little-told story about COVID vaccine injuries.
[00:52:31.817 --> 00:52:37.001]  It's the story of Maddie, one of the children who took part in Pfizer's vaccine study on children.
[00:52:37.702 --> 00:52:48.230]  It's a remarkable account of what happened when Maddie got very, very sick, leading to accusations that Pfizer, the FDA, and the study leaders tried to bury her case.
[00:52:49.191 --> 00:52:56.036]  All three of my kids were in the Pfizer clinical trial for 12 to 15 year olds at Cincinnati Children's.
[00:52:57.409 --> 00:53:06.139]  In summer of 2020, Stephanie DeGarry and her family learned an important clinical trial was about to be launched at nearby Cincinnati Children's Hospital.
[00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:14.148]  It would test Pfizer's experimental COVID-19 vaccine on 12 to 15 year olds to see if it was safe and effective.
[00:53:14.989 --> 00:53:19.651]  The Daguerreys, firmly pro-vaccine, didn't hesitate to let their children take part.
[00:53:20.171 --> 00:53:28.254]  Among three siblings, 12-year-old Maddie alone was chosen to get two doses of Pfizer's vaccine rather than a harmless placebo.
[00:53:28.794 --> 00:53:31.895]  It proved a fateful and debilitating roll of the dice.
[00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:36.677]  Her second dose was January 20th of 2021.
[00:53:36.857 --> 00:53:42.226]  That was my son's 16th birthday, literally the day.
[00:53:42.247 --> 00:53:45.372]  I have a picture of the three of them on that day.
[00:53:47.471 --> 00:53:50.492]  That night, in the middle of the night, that's when it all started.
[00:53:50.612 --> 00:53:55.395]  So less than, maybe, let's just say 12 hours after her second dose.
[00:53:55.735 --> 00:53:57.576]  What kinds of things did she wake up with?
[00:53:57.696 --> 00:53:58.517]  Or was she suffering?
[00:53:58.717 --> 00:54:02.819]  She just came in and asked if she could sleep in our bedroom, which was not normal.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.680]  She said, I don't feel right.
[00:54:05.441 --> 00:54:06.401]  Can I sleep in your room?
[00:54:06.902 --> 00:54:08.243]  So she slept in between us.
[00:54:08.683 --> 00:54:09.123]  Very odd.
[00:54:10.524 --> 00:54:15.627]  And then in the morning, she ended up going to school just because she hates missing school because then you have to make up the work.
[00:54:16.127 --> 00:54:23.292]  So by the time she came home from school, my husband called me at work and said, Maddie's having some sort of reaction.
[00:54:23.312 --> 00:54:28.295]  She had like what she described as electrical shocks going up and down her spine.
[00:54:29.336 --> 00:54:34.099]  She said she felt like her heart was being ripped out.
[00:54:34.499 --> 00:54:35.720]  So chest pain.
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.441]  She had severe abdominal pain.
[00:54:37.481 --> 00:54:39.943]  She was hunched over when she walked through the door.
[00:54:41.004 --> 00:54:45.387]  Her toes and her fingers were white and they were like, when you touch them, they were ice cold.
[00:54:46.327 --> 00:54:47.448]  Um, and painful.
[00:54:47.948 --> 00:54:51.131]  Did you think right away that this was probably a vaccine reaction?
[00:54:51.151 --> 00:54:51.131]  100%.
[00:54:51.971 --> 00:54:54.573]  There was nothing wrong with her prior to that.
[00:54:58.315 --> 00:55:00.877]  Before long, Maddie lost feeling in her legs.
[00:55:01.318 --> 00:55:04.480]  Here, she's scooting on the floor and using her hands to lift her legs.
[00:55:05.543 --> 00:55:09.388]  Degary says she was shocked when the lead study doctor offered no help.
[00:55:09.848 --> 00:55:20.001]  She found herself reluctantly following the advice of physicians who insisted Maddie's paralysis, seizures, passing out, all of it, were caused by anxiety.
[00:55:20.862 --> 00:55:23.844]  I'm embarrassed how much I was brainwashed and believed them.
[00:55:24.424 --> 00:55:28.807]  She did cognitive behavioral therapy, which is seeing a psychologist.
[00:55:29.047 --> 00:55:35.891]  At what point did you think to yourself, I've tried what they said, I know my daughter's not suffering a psychological event?
[00:55:36.392 --> 00:55:39.574]  I always had in the back of my mind, I knew that it wasn't.
[00:55:40.414 --> 00:55:46.858]  So, when she was in her hospital stay in April, they treated her horribly.
[00:55:47.319 --> 00:55:49.160]  Like, they treated her like a crazy person.
[00:55:50.194 --> 00:55:52.996]  Um, and at that point, I knew.
[00:55:53.116 --> 00:55:54.357]  Plus, she wasn't getting better.
[00:55:56.278 --> 00:55:58.500]  Maddie was rushed to the ER nine times.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:07.586]  By the time she was hospitalized for the third time, she had heart problems, seizures, was passing out, vomiting, unable to swallow, and was fed through a tube.
[00:56:08.127 --> 00:56:10.428]  She was in the hospital that time for a month and a half.
[00:56:11.389 --> 00:56:12.169]  Hey, welcome back.
[00:56:12.249 --> 00:56:13.891]  I need to take this out.
[00:56:14.818 --> 00:56:18.239]  Studies are conducted to identify and investigate any health risks.
[00:56:18.719 --> 00:56:22.480]  Maddie's reaction was a giant red flag for Pfizer's vaccine.
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:30.001]  But the Daguerreys say those involved seem more interested in blaming Maddie's illnesses on anything but the obvious culprit.
[00:56:30.701 --> 00:56:39.943]  While Maddie was fighting for her life, the FDA granted emergency use of Pfizer's vaccine for kids as young as age 12 based on the study Maddie took part in.
[00:56:41.112 --> 00:56:50.160]  In a press release, Pfizer reported its vaccine had a favorable safety profile observed across six months of safety follow-up data after the second dose.
[00:56:50.661 --> 00:56:52.142]  No mention of what happened to Maddie.
[00:56:52.682 --> 00:56:57.487]  Parents across the country started rushing to get their children the heavily promoted shots.
[00:56:58.632 --> 00:57:02.954]  You were super duper today getting your COVID vaccine, Elmo.
[00:57:02.974 --> 00:57:05.856]  Yeah, there was a little pinch, but it was okay.
[00:57:06.456 --> 00:57:08.517]  I took a trip up there to the North Pole.
[00:57:08.537 --> 00:57:12.399]  I went there and I vaccinated Santa Claus myself.
[00:57:13.179 --> 00:57:23.265]  It sounds like you have the sense that government slash the drug company and study folks did not want to acknowledge this as a vaccine adverse event.
[00:57:23.425 --> 00:57:24.245]  No, they do not.
[00:57:24.365 --> 00:57:27.747]  And you feel they were not honest about the reporting of her case.
[00:57:28.325 --> 00:57:30.187]  They left out a lot of information.
[00:57:30.387 --> 00:57:35.693]  They reported it as functional abdominal pain, so it's basically a stomach ache that you can't explain.
[00:57:37.372 --> 00:57:44.157]  Congress, heavily funded by pharmaceutical industry donations, has avoided the subject of vaccine injuries for years.
[00:57:44.578 --> 00:57:48.080]  There were no official hearings on COVID vaccine side effects.
[00:57:48.841 --> 00:57:55.286]  In November of 2021, Maddie and her mother appeared at an expert panel held by Senator Ron Johnson.
[00:57:56.066 --> 00:57:57.287]  I've got a quick question.
[00:57:57.347 --> 00:58:02.331]  Obviously, we invited the CEO from Pfizer or some representative from Pfizer.
[00:58:02.351 --> 00:58:03.752]  Nobody showed up.
[00:58:04.153 --> 00:58:05.594]  Pfizer has to be aware of you.
[00:58:05.774 --> 00:58:06.995]  Have they reached out to you?
[00:58:08.743 --> 00:58:15.825]  Neither Pfizer, the FDA, or the CDC has ever talked to us or attempted to.
[00:58:16.165 --> 00:58:17.845]  We have never heard anything from them.
[00:58:19.326 --> 00:58:25.267]  By then, COVID vaccines had been given to young people for six months with sometimes tragic results.
[00:58:25.888 --> 00:58:35.030]  Carrie Peterson Edberg's son Milo got the shot in December of 2021 and ended up with a serious heart problem that's associated with COVID vaccines.
[00:58:35.811 --> 00:58:43.558]  He got vaccinated on like a Friday and on Sunday, he actually, Sunday morning at 1 a.m., was on life support.
[00:58:44.099 --> 00:58:46.301]  He was diagnosed with myocarditis.
[00:58:46.841 --> 00:58:53.067]  Doctors, of course, would not say it was VAX injured, but why would a six-year-old have myocarditis?
[00:58:53.908 --> 00:59:00.314]  Daniel Hartman's 17-year-old son was rushed to the hospital four days after his shot in September of 2021.
[00:59:02.028 --> 00:59:04.129]  My son Sean played hockey his whole life.
[00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:07.530]  To continue to play hockey, he had to get a vaccine.
[00:59:09.031 --> 00:59:12.493]  He took one Pfizer shot and died 33 days later.
[00:59:13.413 --> 00:59:22.817]  And 16-year-old Ernesto, son of single parent Ernest Ramirez, dropped dead of an enlarged heart five days after his Pfizer COVID shot.
[00:59:23.617 --> 00:59:27.339]  When I got there, they were loading him up in the ambulance.
[00:59:28.179 --> 00:59:31.521]  I changed the ambulance to the hospital.
[00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:36.914]  When I got there, they were working on him at the hospital.
[00:59:39.336 --> 00:59:41.058]  And there was a young doctor, he came out.
[00:59:41.859 --> 00:59:42.840]  He goes, your son's dead.
[00:59:44.142 --> 00:59:45.323]  You can go home.
[00:59:46.584 --> 00:59:52.470]  The Daguerreys gave the government, and those who experimented on Maddie, permission to talk with us about her case.
[00:59:52.991 --> 01:00:00.959]  However, Pfizer, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, and lead study scientist Dr. Robert Frank declined comment and wouldn't answer our questions.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:08.447]  Same with CDC, which also wouldn't tell us how many adverse event reports in children it's received for COVID vaccines.
[01:00:09.028 --> 01:00:17.489]  The FDA told Full Measure the FDA takes vaccine safety very seriously and continues to monitor reports of all adverse events.
[01:00:18.342 --> 01:00:26.426]  We have nurses that come in, so... Left to their own devices, Maddie's parents began doing research to try to figure out what was really wrong.
[01:00:27.126 --> 01:00:34.870]  In July of 2022, we saw a neurologist that specializes in autoimmune reactions that cause neurologic problems.
[01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:40.673]  And she was diagnosed with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.
[01:00:40.733 --> 01:00:45.996]  So basically, that's where your body attacks your nerves.
[01:00:47.099 --> 01:00:55.206]  That's an immune disorder known to develop after other vaccinations, too, and is reported in other COVID vaccine recipients after Maddie.
[01:00:56.527 --> 01:01:00.190]  Today, Maddie is still using a wheelchair and a feeding tube.
[01:01:00.571 --> 01:01:07.077]  She can swallow small amounts of water and food, though it wreaks havoc with her stomach, so she's seeing a new specialist for that.
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:11.901]  She's getting more feeling back in her, like in her legs.
[01:01:11.961 --> 01:01:12.962]  It's like moving down.
[01:01:13.562 --> 01:01:15.422]  At one point, she couldn't even hold up her neck.
[01:01:16.363 --> 01:01:17.663]  She can hold up her neck now.
[01:01:18.423 --> 01:01:25.506]  In small advances, Degary says there's hope Maddie will eventually recover, though the family will never be the same.
[01:01:26.586 --> 01:01:31.247]  If you were to tell somebody what this is a story of, what's something you might say?
[01:01:31.828 --> 01:01:40.671]   It's a story of opening up my eyes, seeing things I trusted the government, I trusted doctors, I trusted hospitals.
[01:01:43.011 --> 01:01:44.711]  What I thought they were is not what they are.
[01:01:46.872 --> 01:01:58.474]  We asked federal health officials if they agree with Pfizer's published claim that, quote, there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events in their study on children, but they declined to answer the question.
[01:01:58.694 --> 01:02:02.014]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide, hour number two.
[01:02:02.115 --> 01:02:16.163]   Now, remember, the UN The Council on Foreign Relations, the Democratic Party, they've testified in Congress for years that their main mission is getting me off the air.
[01:02:18.106 --> 01:02:20.028]  And we ought to go back and find those congressional hearings and stuff.
[01:02:20.048 --> 01:02:25.416]   People forget about that and show you them saying, Democrats, Jones is still on the air.
[01:02:25.476 --> 01:02:26.476]  We're working on it, sir.
[01:02:26.496 --> 01:02:27.637]  He'll be off the air soon.
[01:02:28.337 --> 01:02:36.061]  Defense Department meetings, House Armed Services Committees, the military under global control saying I'm their enemy.
[01:02:36.221 --> 01:02:36.582]  Why?
[01:02:37.522 --> 01:02:38.563]  Because I'm not your enemy.
[01:02:41.464 --> 01:02:44.446]  Because I'm here promoting freedom and security and justice.
[01:02:44.786 --> 01:02:45.826]  And I love America.
[01:02:46.887 --> 01:02:47.547]  And they know it.
[01:02:48.628 --> 01:02:49.728]  And they've got my background.
[01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:50.989]  And they fear it.
[01:02:53.137 --> 01:02:55.559]  It's like having a long line of racehorses or something.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.101]  And you know it's a good line of racehorses.
[01:02:58.141 --> 01:03:00.802]  My family's been defending this country since before it existed.
[01:03:02.263 --> 01:03:02.964]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:03:03.024 --> 01:03:05.085]  If you love freedom, I don't care if you just got here.
[01:03:06.386 --> 01:03:06.887]  You're legal.
[01:03:07.847 --> 01:03:08.888]  You're an American too.
[01:03:09.208 --> 01:03:12.010]  But the point is, is that they're the globalists.
[01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:13.872]  They're the ones running down America.
[01:03:13.892 --> 01:03:15.953]  They're the ones constantly putting the country down.
[01:03:16.914 --> 01:03:17.874]  Saying how horrible it is.
[01:03:18.215 --> 01:03:22.478]  Because they want to replace the ideas of freedom that stand in their way of total control.
[01:03:23.905 --> 01:03:31.150]  So if you go back to 1890 or so, and there's been books written on it, and they published news articles, they were very proud of it.
[01:03:31.771 --> 01:03:40.758]  The robber barons, the Carnegies, and later the Rockefellers, and all of them, said Americans are the most literate people there are.
[01:03:40.778 --> 01:03:41.258]  We were.
[01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:43.840]  Even poor people could read good.
[01:03:45.101 --> 01:03:46.742]  And people were anti-establishment.
[01:03:46.762 --> 01:03:47.763]  They were pro-free market.
[01:03:49.892 --> 01:03:57.959]  They were all about a meritocracy, that it was about what you did yourself and what you could produce, not if you came from some blue-blood family.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:06.946]  And America still had classism and elitism, but nothing compared to Europe, and so it was an idea of pulling away from that.
[01:04:07.347 --> 01:04:11.931]  And the French historian Alexandre de Tocqueville wrote a magnum opus on it.
[01:04:11.951 --> 01:04:12.751]  You should read his book.
[01:04:13.812 --> 01:04:16.694]  It's been a decade here, right after the Revolutionary War.
[01:04:17.714 --> 01:04:19.034]  Try to find out who these people are.
[01:04:19.654 --> 01:04:23.755]  So we're the model they're scared of, the idea that took root here.
[01:04:24.856 --> 01:04:28.096]  And so they try to set up the League of Nations after World War I fails.
[01:04:28.476 --> 01:04:48.688]   They set up the UN after that, and they say it's got diplomatic immunity, it's got total power, and then it recruits the politicians, the leaders out of the nation states, to sign over power to the UN And then come to the UN and be able to sex traffic, narcotics traffic, loot gold mines, diamond mines, engage in any crime they want.
[01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:55.234]  And our press was somewhat controlled until recently we got totally controlled.
[01:04:55.735 --> 01:05:04.365]   But even five, ten years ago there were articles everywhere about UN diamond slave mines and UN slave cobalt mines and UN All of it.
[01:05:04.926 --> 01:05:12.971]  And mass sex trafficking, and UN helping run the Rwanda massacre of millions, and now almost nothing.
[01:05:13.352 --> 01:05:14.833]  And they've buried all the old stories.
[01:05:16.794 --> 01:05:18.075]  All the old confirmed reports.
[01:05:18.455 --> 01:05:21.037]  I should make a documentary, somebody should, on the UN's crimes.
[01:05:23.459 --> 01:05:23.639]  So...
[01:05:26.243 --> 01:05:30.446]  Yeah, there's an AP report on thousands of traffic kids out of Haiti and nobody got in trouble, the UN.
[01:05:30.866 --> 01:05:34.549]  That's just, that was the last time AP, like six years ago, did its job.
[01:05:35.809 --> 01:05:36.570]  Nothing since then.
[01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:38.971]  There used to be hundreds of articles a week.
[01:05:39.051 --> 01:05:42.614]  London Guardian, Der Spiegel, Le Figaro.
[01:05:44.175 --> 01:05:45.316]  Now, silence.
[01:05:46.926 --> 01:05:49.008]  Because it's much bigger than it's ever been.
[01:05:49.408 --> 01:05:54.992]  Now it's over 100,000 missing children brought in, and over half a million in the last three years, unattended.
[01:05:55.252 --> 01:05:59.875]  And they tell Congress, DHS, Majorca says, we don't even know where they are.
[01:06:00.176 --> 01:06:03.818]  Then they find some of them, and they're in sex slavery as young as five years old.
[01:06:05.339 --> 01:06:09.983]  Or they're working at battery plants when they're 12.
[01:06:10.043 --> 01:06:11.664]  15 hours a day, sleeping on the cot.
[01:06:13.205 --> 01:06:15.647]  Oh yeah, they came to the land of the free, the home of the brave.
[01:06:17.302 --> 01:06:21.025]  We have fallen so far, ladies and gentlemen, and this is modern slavery.
[01:06:21.865 --> 01:06:24.187]  So I covered it last hour and I'm finishing up on this.
[01:06:25.067 --> 01:06:26.628]  You just joined us and you missed it.
[01:06:26.788 --> 01:06:33.093]  You'll want to go back when this is archived at Bandot Video later today or to the X-Stream at Real Alex Jones and see it.
[01:06:33.813 --> 01:06:35.274]  But Tedros says, we got an emergency.
[01:06:35.314 --> 01:06:36.015]  Everybody hates us.
[01:06:36.055 --> 01:06:36.695]  No one believes us.
[01:06:36.955 --> 01:06:37.756]  They're all liars.
[01:06:37.796 --> 01:06:38.977]  The UN doesn't want power.
[01:06:39.197 --> 01:06:40.518]  The UN doesn't want global government.
[01:06:40.718 --> 01:06:42.279]  The UN doesn't want to control your life.
[01:06:43.743 --> 01:06:58.177]  As he's sitting there next to the head of the UN Emergency Response Team, Dr. Ryan, who's on record saying, we want to be able to get into the homes during the lockdowns and take the kids and break up the families.
[01:06:58.217 --> 01:07:03.422]  And he's since written reports saying, we want to arrest people that are against the lockdowns in the future.
[01:07:03.602 --> 01:07:07.226]  And it's in Canadian and Australian and German documents that are actually did it.
[01:07:09.397 --> 01:07:13.919]  There's Dr. Michael Ryan sitting right next to Ted Ross when he denied any of this is going on.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:25.726]  And at the moment, in most parts of the world, due to lockdown, most of the transmission that's actually happening in many countries now is happening in the household, at family level.
[01:07:26.426 --> 01:07:31.469]  In some senses, transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family units.
[01:07:32.902 --> 01:07:42.384]  Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[01:07:43.884 --> 01:07:49.545]  It's now my great pleasure to invite Lady Gaga.
[01:07:52.205 --> 01:07:53.125]  These people are a joke.
[01:07:54.226 --> 01:07:56.186]  But they're very, very serious in their plans.
[01:07:56.566 --> 01:08:01.887]  They've built these giant sprawling camps all over the world at you and direction to lock us up.
[01:08:03.936 --> 01:08:09.037]  By the way, we won't air this live today, but who was the Canadian guy that never even made a film?
[01:08:09.077 --> 01:08:09.777]  He made that one film.
[01:08:09.797 --> 01:08:10.917]  He was so angry during lockdown.
[01:08:11.317 --> 01:08:14.758]  That's the cartoon about a future dystopia with a new virus.
[01:08:15.338 --> 01:08:19.199]  I want to add that in here in post when we post this to Bandai Video.
[01:08:19.339 --> 01:08:19.839]  I want to add that.
[01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:20.839]  Okay, guys, put a note, please.
[01:08:20.859 --> 01:08:26.040]  I forget the name of the little short film, but you'll find it.
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:26.460]  We'll add it.
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:26.921]  We'll do that.
[01:08:28.761 --> 01:08:29.041]  Okay.
[01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:32.200]  Now, what is the UN saying?
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:33.481]  They're saying they're above the law.
[01:08:33.842 --> 01:08:38.345]  I kind of sped read through this at the end of the last hour.
[01:08:42.288 --> 01:08:52.656]  Now, I'm reading to you from the United Nations Charter, 1946.
[01:08:54.317 --> 01:09:00.717]   And I just read through all the areas Where they say we're above the law.
[01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:02.678]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:09:03.198 --> 01:09:05.138]  So that's page one, that's page two.
[01:09:05.778 --> 01:09:07.799]  They can have taxes, regulations on you.
[01:09:08.259 --> 01:09:10.279]  No government can stop them, they're above the law.
[01:09:10.299 --> 01:09:18.500]  And then it starts getting into the individuals at the UN and how they are above the law.
[01:09:22.101 --> 01:09:23.961]  Article two, property, funds, and assets.
[01:09:23.981 --> 01:09:36.652]   The United Nations is, and it's property and assets, Wherever located and wherever held shall enjoy immunity from every form of legal procedure except in so far as particular case it has expressly waived the immunity, which it never does.
[01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:42.257]  That's why they won't give any of their refugees the shots because that's liability on the country they're doing it to.
[01:09:43.918 --> 01:09:46.660]  They want to say no legislation, no government can stand against them.
[01:09:46.941 --> 01:09:47.201]  Right here.
[01:09:50.129 --> 01:09:51.830]  Let's skip ahead to where I left off earlier.
[01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:57.672]  Section 7 of the United Nations, its assets, income, and properties shall be A. exempt from all direct taxes.
[01:09:58.253 --> 01:10:04.956]  It is understood, however, that the United Nations will not claim exemption from taxes which are in fact no more than charges for public utility services.
[01:10:05.676 --> 01:10:15.420]  B. except for customs duties and prohibitions and restrictions on imports and exports in respect to articles imported or exported by the United Nations for its official use.
[01:10:15.721 --> 01:10:21.052]   It is understood, however, that articles imported under such Exemption will not be sold the country to which they were
[01:10:21.052 --> 01:10:24.702]   imported except under conditions agreed to with governments of the country.
[01:10:24.702 --> 01:10:33.512]   C) Exempt from customs duties and prohibitions and restrictions and imports and exports in respect to its
[01:10:33.512 --> 01:10:34.702]  publications.
[01:10:34.702 --> 01:10:40.702]   Article 4, the representatives of its members. This is where they give themselves immunity.
[01:10:40.801 --> 01:10:41.142]  Section 2.
[01:10:41.342 --> 01:10:44.044]  Representatives are members of the principal or subsidiary organs.
[01:10:44.184 --> 01:10:45.566]  Oh, the subsidiary organs.
[01:10:45.586 --> 01:10:58.658]  The NGOs of the United Nations and to conferences convened by the United Nations shall, while exercising their functions and during the journey to and from the place of the meeting, enjoy the following privileges and immunities.
[01:10:58.958 --> 01:11:01.400]  So when they're out in your country, they're immune too.
[01:11:01.981 --> 01:11:03.222]  If your country is not a treaty to that.
[01:11:03.662 --> 01:11:04.223]  Above the law. 007.
[01:11:05.584 --> 01:11:15.892]  A. Immunity from personal arrest or detention and from seizure of their personal baggage and in respect or word spoken or written and all acts done to them in the capacity of representatives.
[01:11:15.932 --> 01:11:18.094]  Immunity from legal process of every kind.
[01:11:18.454 --> 01:11:21.016]  That's why they're always still getting caught because they get so reckless.
[01:11:21.717 --> 01:11:23.618]  Shipping drugs, kidnap kids, you name it.
[01:11:23.838 --> 01:11:25.920]  You can't check the planes they're flying in and out.
[01:11:26.881 --> 01:11:26.901]  B.
[01:11:30.296 --> 01:11:32.557]  Invulnerability for all papers and documents.
[01:11:32.797 --> 01:11:33.638]  That means they're above the law.
[01:11:34.298 --> 01:11:39.541]  The right to use codes and to receive papers and correspondence by courier or in sealed bags.
[01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:42.263]  Perfect spies for the different countries that are part of it.
[01:11:42.763 --> 01:11:55.230]  The exemption in respect to themselves and their spouses from immigration restrictions, alien registration, and national service obligations to the state they are visiting through which they are passing in the exercise of their functions.
[01:11:55.531 --> 01:11:57.592]  That's why their NGOs run the human smuggling.
[01:11:58.422 --> 01:11:59.143]  So they're above the law.
[01:11:59.643 --> 01:12:10.215]  C. The same facilities and respect of currency and exchange restrictions and are accorded to representatives of foreign governments to temporary official missions.
[01:12:10.835 --> 01:12:14.800]  And it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:16.301]  How they're above the law.
[01:12:16.742 --> 01:12:17.563]  How they're immune.
[01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:18.424]  Look at this subsection.
[01:12:18.904 --> 01:12:18.424]  18.
[01:12:19.385 --> 01:12:20.005]  Official use.
[01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:30.519]  The United Nations shall be immune from legal process in respect of words spoken or written and all acts performed by them in their official capacity.
[01:12:31.488 --> 01:12:37.754]  B. Be exempt from taxation of the salaries or emoluments paid to them by the United Nations.
[01:12:37.774 --> 01:12:39.395]  Well, pretty good deal to get under their control, huh?
[01:12:39.836 --> 01:12:42.738]  Your politicians sell out to this and then become minions of it.
[01:12:43.119 --> 01:12:43.659]  They work for it.
[01:12:43.899 --> 01:12:44.540]  Revolving door.
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:47.823]  C. Be immune from national service obligations.
[01:12:48.343 --> 01:12:54.669]  D. Be immune together with their spouses, relatives, dependent on them from immigration restrictions and alien registration.
[01:12:56.991 --> 01:12:57.832]  It's an open border cult.
[01:12:59.753 --> 01:13:11.299]  E. Be accorded the same privileges and respect of exchange facilities and are accorded to officials or comparable ranks forming part of the diplomatic mission or to the government concerned.
[01:13:11.599 --> 01:13:13.740]  So if a government's working with the UN, they're exempt too.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:15.041]  That's pretty nice, huh?
[01:13:15.621 --> 01:13:25.947]  F. Be given together with their spouses and relatives, dependents on them, the same repatriation facilities in the time of international crisis or diplomatic envoys.
[01:13:26.267 --> 01:13:27.627]  They can travel anywhere they want, whenever they want.
[01:13:29.298 --> 01:13:32.821]  Have the right to import free of duty their furniture and effects.
[01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:34.562]  It goes on.
[01:13:34.582 --> 01:13:34.562]  19.
[01:13:36.063 --> 01:13:38.625]  And it gives the Secretary General dictator-like power.
[01:13:38.645 --> 01:13:42.768]  In their 31 articles, it's a separate document.
[01:13:42.828 --> 01:13:47.191]  In Article 30, they give themselves total immunity above everybody from all crimes.
[01:13:48.592 --> 01:13:49.593]  Here's Section 22.
[01:13:49.853 --> 01:13:54.477]  Immunity from personal assets or detention and from seizure of their personal baggage.
[01:13:55.475 --> 01:13:58.597]  Diplomatic immunity, it just goes on and on and on.
[01:13:58.797 --> 01:14:02.797]  You need to go read this for yourself.
[01:14:02.797 --> 01:14:10.797]  Look at section 30.
[01:14:10.797 --> 01:14:16.797]  [ Silence ]
[01:14:16.847 --> 01:14:28.235]   All differences arising out of the interpretation apply of the present convention shall be referenced in the
[01:14:28.235 --> 01:14:29.835]  International Court of Justice.
[01:14:29.835 --> 01:14:36.155]   So then if there's any challenges to this, it has to go to the UN Court. Unless in any case
[01:14:36.155 --> 01:14:41.515]   it's agreed by the parties to have recourse to another mode of settlement, if a difference
[01:14:41.515 --> 01:14:47.036]   arises between the United Nations in one hand and a member of the other hand, a request shall be made
[01:14:47.036 --> 01:14:52.076]   for an advisory opinion on any legal question involved in accordance with Article 96 of the
[01:14:52.076 --> 01:14:57.036]  Charter and Article 65 of the State of the Court.
[01:14:55.398 --> 01:15:01.264]  The opinion given by the Court shall be accepted as decisive by the parties.
[01:15:01.284 --> 01:15:02.506]  So again, the U.N.
[01:15:02.566 --> 01:15:03.567]  Court is over itself.
[01:15:04.287 --> 01:15:06.169]  Above the law, judge themselves.
[01:15:06.570 --> 01:15:07.431]  You want me to read you more here?
[01:15:10.475 --> 01:15:11.636]  I just, nobody does this.
[01:15:11.916 --> 01:15:13.717]  I read this years ago, five or six times.
[01:15:14.097 --> 01:15:15.478]  I thought I'd just read it to you again.
[01:15:16.359 --> 01:15:20.061]  Guys, print me the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.
[01:15:22.123 --> 01:15:23.504]  Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
[01:15:25.505 --> 01:15:26.686]  You can give me the latest version.
[01:15:27.166 --> 01:15:33.070]  They've expanded it to pedophiles and everything else, but in there it just says we're totally above the law again.
[01:15:35.666 --> 01:15:44.914]  That's who wants to run your life, that's who wants to control your country, that's who wants you to sign treaties with them, while they tell you none of this is going on and none of this is happening.
[01:15:45.495 --> 01:15:47.797]  While they run genocides around the world.
[01:15:48.497 --> 01:15:52.421]  Extremely powerful information.
[01:15:53.962 --> 01:15:57.645]  All right, I'm done talking about the United Nations.
[01:15:58.866 --> 01:16:06.139]   I want to start shifting gears into understanding who runs this at the top. Because again, the
[01:16:06.139 --> 01:16:11.088]   UN was created by the criminals that hijacked our country at the end of World War
[01:16:11.088 --> 01:16:16.369]   II and set the National Security Act of '47 at the same time the UN was
[01:16:16.369 --> 01:16:22.648]   set up to transfer power into it and give it secrecy and diplomatic immunity, just
[01:16:22.648 --> 01:16:27.019]   like the National Security Act of '47 says the CIA and any other
[01:16:27.019 --> 01:16:32.578]   agency is above the law and totally secret and no one can see what they're doing
[01:16:32.578 --> 01:16:36.979]   and they can operate and have unlimited funds to do whatever they want.
[01:16:36.416 --> 01:16:36.737]  Look it up.
[01:16:38.198 --> 01:16:39.659]  Guys, pull up the National Security Act 1947.
[01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:46.659]  Oh, it says you can do four-year requests, but they can classify stuff for 20 years.
[01:16:46.999 --> 01:16:49.520]  They've now expanded it to classify it for 100 years.
[01:16:51.321 --> 01:16:52.262]  Pfizer has U.N.
[01:16:52.282 --> 01:16:53.062]  diplomatic immunity.
[01:16:53.102 --> 01:16:58.525]  That's how they went into federal courts and said, we don't want to show you our Pfizer trials for 100 years.
[01:16:58.625 --> 01:16:59.065]  First, it was 75.
[01:16:59.125 --> 01:17:04.628]  They said, well, actually, we'll murder you all way before then.
[01:17:05.008 --> 01:17:06.409]  You can have it in 100 years.
[01:17:07.509 --> 01:17:09.670]  You don't get this immunity as a citizen.
[01:17:09.690 --> 01:17:10.991]  In fact, you have less rights.
[01:17:12.432 --> 01:17:14.093]  Being a citizen now is a chump.
[01:17:15.094 --> 01:17:19.917]  Maybe you could renounce your citizenship, go call yourself an illegal alien, move to Mexico, move back, be above the law.
[01:17:20.137 --> 01:17:21.218]  But they won't let you do that.
[01:17:21.518 --> 01:17:22.678]  They will disregard that.
[01:17:23.459 --> 01:17:25.300]  Because you were trained to be a chump.
[01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:27.381]  You were trained to submit.
[01:17:28.022 --> 01:17:29.403]  You were trained to bow down.
[01:17:29.802 --> 01:17:31.802]  You were trained to go along.
[01:17:32.302 --> 01:17:34.302]  [Dramatic Music]

[01:20:13.305 --> 01:20:13.825]  Good morning!
[01:20:14.865 --> 01:20:18.086]  We are bringing to you today's most important news from around the world.
[01:20:19.126 --> 01:20:28.029]  Despite all the extraordinary efforts, the government and health system workers are still struggling to bend the curve of growing cases caused by the latest variant of the virus.
[01:20:28.769 --> 01:20:32.350]  Five more people died today and 30 million tested positively.
[01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:41.492]  Citizens are now required to wear masks when they step out to the balconies of their isolation facilities and take them off only when they are back to the safety of their rooms.
[01:20:42.685 --> 01:20:43.405]  Stay compliant.
[01:20:44.265 --> 01:20:44.946]  Stay isolated.
[01:20:45.846 --> 01:20:46.426]  Stay safe.
[01:20:49.607 --> 01:20:51.087]  And now, on to other news.
[01:20:52.288 --> 01:21:00.030]  As the whole planet went on the righteous crusade against climate change and global warming, we are excited to spread the word about another successful project.
[01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:05.691]  As science tells us, during the night, plants release CO2 into the atmosphere.
[01:21:06.792 --> 01:21:13.103]   CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas that dramatically contributes to global warming, But don't worry.
[01:21:14.164 --> 01:21:25.952]  Almost 100,000 square miles of South American rainforest has been cleared, and this area is used to construct one of the largest solar panel fields in the world that will provide us with a tremendous amount of clean energy.
[01:21:26.972 --> 01:21:30.335]  We will keep fighting the deadly forests and defeat climate change.

[01:27:03.917 --> 01:27:05.357]  Say goodbye to cows and beef.
[01:27:06.498 --> 01:27:12.199]  As you might know, cows and livestock agriculture in general, is a source of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.
[01:27:13.219 --> 01:27:18.761]  Cows fart, and the temperature on earth rises one degree with each cow fart, contributing to global warming.
[01:27:20.748 --> 01:27:26.571]  This is why the authorities started a cow extermination program, and today the last herd of cows has been dealt with.
[01:27:27.611 --> 01:27:32.374]  The Earth has officially become a cow-free planet, and climate change is finally under control.
[01:27:34.214 --> 01:27:35.255]  You might get concerned.
[01:27:35.595 --> 01:27:37.276]  Where would we obtain our proteins from?
[01:27:38.296 --> 01:27:42.098]  Chicken and pork are not commonly accessible products, and beef is gone now.
[01:27:43.159 --> 01:27:43.859]  Do not worry.
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:49.862]  Hundreds of alternative protein manufacturing facilities have been constructed on each continent.
[01:27:50.899 --> 01:27:53.500]  They process thousands of tons of protein-rich food.
[01:27:54.481 --> 01:27:57.362]  This alternative food contains way more protein than beef.
[01:27:58.462 --> 01:28:01.804]  It is cheap to cultivate and it doesn't contribute to global warming.
[01:28:02.784 --> 01:28:04.765]  Kudos to science and green agenda!
[01:28:06.446 --> 01:28:07.306]  That is all for today.

[01:34:47.603 --> 01:34:53.347]  Some countries are imposing lockdowns and stay-home orders to protect their populations from this highly contagious disease.
[01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:59.230]   In our country, three persons in their 90s died of the virus in long-term care facilities.
[01:34:59.230 --> 01:35:15.871]  The virus keeps spreading in our country.
[01:35:16.028 --> 01:35:18.530]  Almost 500 new cases have been registered last week.
[01:35:19.450 --> 01:35:22.333]  As of today, the whole country is going into a complete lockdown.
[01:35:23.188 --> 01:35:25.753]  The health authorities are imposing a strict stay-at-home order.
[01:35:26.595 --> 01:35:28.579]  While these measures are tough, they are temporary.
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:31.240]  We need only two weeks to bend the curve.
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:52.600]   The pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity

[01:37:48.052 --> 01:37:51.252]  you will be transported to a safe isolated location.

[01:41:44.054 --> 01:41:52.055]   In a letter written to Congress by 10 retired FBI agents, including former directors, assistant directors, and
[01:41:52.055 --> 01:41:58.465]   special agents in charge, every concern facing the American people over our invaded
[01:41:44.438 --> 01:41:51.057]   In a letter written to Congress by 10 retired FBI agents, including former directors, assistant
[01:41:51.057 --> 01:41:57.856]   directors and special agents in charge, every concern facing the American people over our
[01:41:57.856 --> 01:42:00.797]  invaded border was verified.
[01:42:00.797 --> 01:42:06.757]   "The surge in numbers of single military-aged males descending upon American cities and
[01:42:06.757 --> 01:42:08.957]  towns is alarming and perilous.
[01:42:08.957 --> 01:42:14.398]   Additionally, they are not just from terror-linked regions, but from China and Russia as well.
[01:42:14.398 --> 01:42:20.516]   They are hostile adversaries of the United States with aspirations to devastate national
[01:42:20.516 --> 01:42:21.516]  infrastructure.
[01:42:21.516 --> 01:42:28.476]   For these reasons, elements of this recent surge are likely no accident or coincidence."
[01:42:28.658 --> 01:42:34.960]  These men are potential operators in what appears to be an accelerated and strategic penetration.
[01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:47.642]  A soft invasion, designed to gain internal access to a country that cannot be invaded militarily in order to inflict catastrophic damage if and when enemies deem it necessary.
[01:42:47.762 --> 01:42:56.026]  Well, now we know for a fact the United Nations is funding the migrant crisis, we can stop guessing, from the Center for Immigration Studies.
[01:42:56.166 --> 01:43:00.568]  United Nations budgets million for U.S.-bound migrants in 2024.
[01:43:01.069 --> 01:43:07.612]  Public documents show cash handouts to help feed, transport, and house people headed for the U.S.
[01:43:07.632 --> 01:43:07.872]  border.
[01:43:08.072 --> 01:43:27.062]  You know, in a nutshell, the United Nations and its advocacy partners are planning to spread the $372 million in cash and voucher assistance and multi-purpose cash assistance to some 624,000 immigrants in transit to the United States during 2024.
[01:43:27.262 --> 01:43:31.925]  Does this look honestly like this would stop anybody?
[01:43:32.585 --> 01:43:33.126]  It's a joke.
[01:43:34.527 --> 01:43:40.912]  And Governor Abbott, for three years, have just been letting people in, millions at a time, and now he's making a stand over this?
[01:43:41.552 --> 01:43:42.293]  Over this?
[01:43:43.214 --> 01:43:44.295]  That's what this is all about?
[01:43:44.315 --> 01:43:46.997]  I'm just trying to put in perspective for people.
[01:43:47.037 --> 01:43:48.058]  That's all I'm trying to do.
[01:43:48.718 --> 01:43:50.900]  The truth is the truth, no matter how it looks.
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:52.161]  And that's the truth.
[01:43:52.221 --> 01:43:53.202]  Take a look at it one more time.
[01:43:53.802 --> 01:43:55.704]  This is what it's about, America, right here.
[01:43:56.104 --> 01:43:57.065]  This cheap wire.
[01:43:57.405 --> 01:43:59.407]  That they can come over here and cut themselves.
[01:43:59.887 --> 01:44:27.351]  President Biden's threat to force Texas Governor Abbott to face the consequences should Texas not abide by the Biden administration's demand that razor wire be removed from the Texas border so that millions more non-naturalized military-aged men can flood the border to go who knows where to prepare for who knows what has so far resulted in the White House freezing new natural gas export licenses.
[01:44:27.691 --> 01:44:30.675]  As if Biden were sanctioning a foreign enemy.
[01:44:31.095 --> 01:44:46.615]  Meanwhile, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, World Economic Forum member and reoccurring Davos attendee, was on the other side of the world, in India, opening a back door for globalization in Texas with the Texas Economic Development Corporation.
[01:44:46.795 --> 01:44:49.035]  Yeah, it's not a coincidence that he went to Mumbai.
[01:44:49.075 --> 01:44:54.877]  Keep in mind, Mumbai is, well, the beginning of the new Indo-European corridor.
[01:44:55.217 --> 01:45:01.358]  Just like I-69 down there in McAllen and other places down there in Brownsville, those three feeders that then go up to Detroit.
[01:45:01.398 --> 01:45:05.239]  Keep in mind, World Economic Forum also has a big presence in Detroit.
[01:45:05.559 --> 01:45:08.699]  But the bottom line is, a lot of this is about trade corridors.
[01:45:08.899 --> 01:45:11.560]  These little fights are like swatting mosquitoes.
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:15.923]  Don't get killed in Eagle Pass.
[01:45:16.544 --> 01:45:18.205]  We got a much bigger thing going on.
[01:45:18.225 --> 01:45:20.387]  We've got a much bigger fish to fry.
[01:45:20.507 --> 01:45:21.848]  None of this makes sense.
[01:45:22.429 --> 01:45:28.774]  A real president following his duty wouldn't disregard our national security to the level of treason.
[01:45:29.015 --> 01:45:36.221]  We are sitting idly by waiting on a false flag to be followed by martial law and the cancellation of the 2024 election.
[01:45:37.882 --> 01:45:43.646]  As you may know, I have had my insurance license in the state of California for over a decade.
[01:45:43.987 --> 01:45:50.311]  And when I was reviewing policies for 2024, I noticed this new exclusion.
[01:45:50.532 --> 01:45:59.458]  Treatment of an injury or sickness which is due to war, declared or undeclared, riot or insurrection.
[01:45:59.839 --> 01:46:01.280]  This is not typical.
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:02.600]  Check this out.
[01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:07.282]  They actually have the camouflage clothes of the illegal aliens hanging up in the tree.
[01:46:07.342 --> 01:46:09.063]  So these are the illegals that don't want to get caught.
[01:46:09.083 --> 01:46:10.203]  These are the so-called runners.
[01:46:10.784 --> 01:46:21.288]  This camp that's partially funded by Pima County, that is operated under the Universalist Unitarian Church out of Tucson, Arizona, is aiding and abetting cartel runners.
[01:46:22.228 --> 01:46:23.630]  Directly into Arizona.
[01:46:23.670 --> 01:46:26.072]  The border is an open, bleeding wound.
[01:46:26.532 --> 01:46:31.317]  Slashed repeatedly by the United Nations infiltration of Agenda 2030.
[01:46:31.397 --> 01:46:34.741]  This is no longer clouded by speculation.
[01:46:35.061 --> 01:46:37.143]  This is exactly what is happening.
[01:46:37.463 --> 01:46:38.244]  Prepare now.
[01:46:38.805 --> 01:46:40.006]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:46:40.507 --> 01:46:41.768]  Many botanists die.
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:44.200]  Bring us this information.
[01:46:44.701 --> 01:46:48.943]  You can see here the Great Awakening orbiting the Great Reset.
[01:46:49.663 --> 01:46:59.407]  Although the depopulation systems of the Great Reset are not yet fully operational, the Great Reset does have a strong conspiracy network.
[01:46:59.847 --> 01:47:05.750]  It is protected by a satanic shield, which can be disabled by the Great Awakening.
[01:47:06.150 --> 01:47:12.353]  The Great Reset must be deactivated if any victory for humanity is to be accomplished.
[01:47:13.388 --> 01:47:27.431]  Once the Great Awakening deactivates the shield, InfoWars.com forward slash show will cover the truth while Info Warriors fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the Great Reset.
[01:47:27.931 --> 01:47:31.652]  Alex Jones has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.

[01:47:37.233 --> 01:47:41.014]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:42.588 --> 01:47:45.389]  We're about to hit the really big news I've been talking about the last hour and a half.
[01:47:45.409 --> 01:47:56.651]  But first, about 15 minutes ago, I got some really huge intel from our high-level federal sources in the federal court system, and I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:47:56.711 --> 01:48:00.552]  It's as high-level as you can get, other than, like, the Supreme Court.
[01:48:02.232 --> 01:48:07.053]  And I said, well, this is so huge, will you please send me that in writing?
[01:48:07.373 --> 01:48:11.034]  Not so that I have proof, I know they're a great source, but so I don't get it wrong.
[01:48:13.285 --> 01:48:14.225]  And they said, absolutely.
[01:48:14.426 --> 01:48:19.028]  So I'm waiting for them to give me a write-up, and we'll have this breaking for you next hour.
[01:48:20.208 --> 01:48:21.489]  But let's just leave it at this.
[01:48:23.950 --> 01:48:25.951]  Texas is about to get a big victory on the border.
[01:48:27.832 --> 01:48:28.632]  With the court case.
[01:48:29.633 --> 01:48:30.393]  With the bar bar.
[01:48:31.594 --> 01:48:36.136]  And, again, I don't even care if somebody else breaks in the next 30 minutes, because I want to get it dead right.
[01:48:37.536 --> 01:48:40.498]  And I just talked to them, and I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:48:41.397 --> 01:48:43.038]  But the good guys are definitely on the move.
[01:48:43.758 --> 01:48:44.979]  And the government's not our enemy.
[01:48:45.259 --> 01:48:47.000]  It's been hijacked at the top by criminals.
[01:48:48.741 --> 01:48:53.484]  The government itself, 90% of it, you know, the top's bad, 90% of it's good.
[01:48:53.784 --> 01:48:55.005]  They are hopping pissed.
[01:48:55.605 --> 01:49:05.671]  Just like when they ordered them to move in on the Texas Guard last week and it came out in the news, the War Patrol said, nope, we're not, we're not arresting the State Guard and we're done.
[01:49:06.612 --> 01:49:08.173]  We're sick of you giving us criminal orders.
[01:49:09.617 --> 01:49:12.478]  So it's a historic moment to be alive right now.
[01:49:13.398 --> 01:49:14.338]  That's all I can say.
[01:49:15.259 --> 01:49:16.099]  It's our government.
[01:49:16.199 --> 01:49:16.959]  It's been hijacked.
[01:49:16.979 --> 01:49:17.740]  We're going to get it back.
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:18.560]  We're going to cut it down.
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:19.720]  It's out of control.
[01:49:20.380 --> 01:49:22.041]  But civil war is not what we want.
[01:49:22.061 --> 01:49:23.281]  This is not a civil war.
[01:49:24.001 --> 01:49:27.663]  This is a fight against a globalist coup and an outside takeover.
[01:49:28.023 --> 01:49:33.084]  They're trying to brand it as a civil war all over the controlled media, all over Hollywood.
[01:49:33.324 --> 01:49:35.325]  That's not what it is.
[01:49:37.952 --> 01:49:40.973]  And it's not a shooting war that's going to fix this, folks.
[01:49:41.573 --> 01:49:45.634]  It's taking our government back legally and lawfully, and it's going to be hard.
[01:49:46.555 --> 01:49:55.638]  But they want a physical confrontation, because out of the mess that's going to create, they hope they can muddy the water until people don't know what's going on, and they can win.
[01:49:55.658 --> 01:49:59.919]  And they're still going to lose down that road, but they've got a better chance of winning down that road.
[01:50:01.391 --> 01:50:04.032]  We got like a 60% chance of winning down that road, but it'll be hell.
[01:50:04.552 --> 01:50:07.854]  We got a 90% chance of winning on the course we're on right now, conservatively.
[01:50:10.175 --> 01:50:29.118]   So, they're the bad guys, we're the good guys, and almost no one with half a brain is buying the fact that Trump's a white supremacist and all this crap, and The police want to murder the black people and all this BS, and people are really starting to get it quickly.
[01:50:29.598 --> 01:50:33.959]  That's why we're in danger of them doing a financial collapse or a wider war, which we're already in.
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:38.361]  Okay, let me clear my mind here and shift to the next big issue.
[01:50:39.562 --> 01:50:41.402]  So what happens is, I don't have teleprompters, folks.
[01:50:41.742 --> 01:50:42.703]  Nobody tell me what to say.
[01:50:44.173 --> 01:50:56.198]  I do all the research, I have all the news, and then every stack is a whole new area of thought, a whole deep dive, a whole critical thing, and it's hard to jump from one topic to another because this stuff's so heavy.
[01:50:56.238 --> 01:51:05.422]  So I've got to somehow decouple my sentences from that data, even though it's all interconnected, for the destabilization operation.
[01:51:06.062 --> 01:51:09.364]  I'll tie into that at the end, the border, tie into the CIA and all this.
[01:51:10.367 --> 01:51:15.389]  First thing I need to do is go into the history of it and explain it and then lay out all this evidence.
[01:51:15.409 --> 01:51:17.790]  We'll skip this break so we have more time.
[01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:22.492]  But I need three minutes to clear my mind.
[01:51:24.032 --> 01:51:27.934]  So I get so excited about this other big thing that that took over my brain for a minute.
[01:51:27.974 --> 01:51:37.377]   I'm like literally trying to stop it, stop it, and it takes a little bit to Get excited, because what happens is I've done the research coldly, but I have excitement and energy about each section.
[01:51:37.917 --> 01:51:42.999]  And then I get obsessed with one thing and then it's like your favorite football team wins a championship.
[01:51:43.039 --> 01:51:49.042]  And then you're supposed to shift gears in 60 seconds and do something completely different.
[01:51:49.062 --> 01:51:50.022]  And it's kind of hard to do.
[01:51:50.102 --> 01:51:58.907]  So I'm being honest with you about how my brain works and what's going on here, because I really want to nail this in the 20 something minutes we'll have left in this hour.
[01:51:58.947 --> 01:51:59.587]  So let me do this.
[01:52:02.887 --> 01:52:10.170]  I wrote the sarcastic headline, the great affiliate relations director, the longest serving employee here, I guess 20 years or longer.
[01:52:10.751 --> 01:52:15.713]  John Harmon loves occasionally to put out videos, so I've asked him to put another one out.
[01:52:16.213 --> 01:52:17.954]  He just put this out about 20 minutes ago.
[01:52:18.014 --> 01:52:20.355]  It's on X, on Real Alex Jones.
[01:52:20.375 --> 01:52:21.716]  It's got a sarcastic headline.
[01:52:22.952 --> 01:52:24.574]  It's only three and a half minutes long.
[01:52:24.754 --> 01:52:27.196]  It's laughing at the left should be illegal.
[01:52:28.017 --> 01:52:29.098]  The ADL is right.
[01:52:29.198 --> 01:52:30.380]  It's time to ban comedy.
[01:52:30.700 --> 01:52:33.323]  And of course, I'm being sarcastic there, but here it is.
[01:52:34.073 --> 01:52:35.514]  They want to take our rights.
[01:52:36.015 --> 01:52:39.397]  But human rights are just like heaven and like God.
[01:52:39.897 --> 01:52:41.419]  It's just a fictional story.
[01:52:42.099 --> 01:52:46.923]  The only place you find rights is in the fictional stories.
[01:52:47.283 --> 01:52:49.145]  He believes in nothing, Labovkin, nothing.
[01:52:49.325 --> 01:52:51.266]  They want to change the Constitution.
[01:52:51.747 --> 01:52:52.207]  Hell yes!
[01:52:52.327 --> 01:52:53.428]  We're gonna take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[01:52:53.488 --> 01:52:54.409]  Banned assault weapons, now!
[01:52:58.502 --> 01:53:00.704]  Ban them now!
[01:53:01.144 --> 01:53:05.288]  49% of my fellow Texans believe in a mandatory buyback program.
[01:53:05.648 --> 01:53:07.289]  Only 35% oppose.
[01:53:07.710 --> 01:53:08.750]  You sure about that?
[01:53:09.111 --> 01:53:10.071]  You sure about that?
[01:53:10.452 --> 01:53:12.113]  They want to erase our borders.
[01:53:12.493 --> 01:53:16.517]  Why are you guys making it easier for people to enter the country illegally?
[01:53:16.537 --> 01:53:18.198]  I don't believe we are.
[01:53:18.438 --> 01:53:19.199]  Why do you think we are?
[01:53:19.519 --> 01:53:24.083]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[01:53:25.686 --> 01:53:27.346]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[01:53:27.606 --> 01:53:28.567]  They deserve to be heard.
[01:53:28.587 --> 01:53:29.407]  That's who we are.
[01:53:29.427 --> 01:53:33.668]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee, and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[01:53:33.968 --> 01:53:35.328]  Come on down!
[01:53:35.448 --> 01:53:39.169]  You're the next contestant on The Price is Right!
[01:53:39.469 --> 01:53:41.049]  They want to steal your money.
[01:53:41.729 --> 01:53:44.690]  We change retirement age to reflect life expectancy.
[01:53:44.710 --> 01:53:46.670]  65 is way too low.
[01:53:47.110 --> 01:53:49.751]  I'm sending Congress a supplemental budget request.
[01:53:50.856 --> 01:53:53.677]  It's going to keep weapons and ammunition flowing without interruption.
[01:53:54.137 --> 01:54:00.939]  An unprecedented estimated $105 billion in security funding for Israel and Ukraine.
[01:54:00.959 --> 01:54:04.360]  $60 billion is said to be slated for the fight against Russia.
[01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:09.381]  Meanwhile... New federal report finds Americans are struggling to keep up with paying their bills.
[01:54:09.721 --> 01:54:15.383]  4 in 10 adults said it's been somewhat or very difficult to cover the usual household expenses.
[01:54:15.563 --> 01:54:17.584]  They want the kill off the old America.
[01:54:17.624 --> 01:54:21.365]  The most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland is white supremacy.
[01:54:22.945 --> 01:54:25.106]  They were insurrectionists, not patriots.
[01:54:25.946 --> 01:54:27.006]  Oh my God!
[01:54:27.267 --> 01:54:30.628]  We'll teach Donald Trump a valuable lesson.
[01:54:31.087 --> 01:54:35.087]   Don't mess with the women of America unless you want to get the benefit.
[01:54:35.087 --> 01:54:37.087]  [cheering]
[01:54:37.087 --> 01:54:40.087]  [explosion]
[01:54:40.087 --> 01:54:55.087]  [laughing]
[01:54:55.087 --> 01:54:56.087]  No!
[01:54:56.463 --> 01:54:57.724]  God, please, no!
[01:54:57.985 --> 01:54:58.425]  No!
[01:54:59.206 --> 01:54:59.886]  Go f*** yourself.
[01:55:01.328 --> 01:55:05.051]  Go f*** yourself.
[01:55:06.192 --> 01:55:06.653]  Is that clear?
[01:55:06.472 --> 01:55:08.472]  I hope it is.
[01:55:08.472 --> 01:55:28.472]   *Screaming* *Outro*
[01:55:28.497 --> 01:55:34.497]   Your game is through, 'cause now you have to answer to America
[01:55:34.497 --> 01:55:35.497]  Frick yeah!
[01:55:35.497 --> 01:55:41.497]   So lick my butt and suck on my bum, America Frick yeah!
[01:55:41.497 --> 01:55:44.497]  What you gonna do when we come for you now?
[01:55:44.497 --> 01:55:50.497]   It's the dream that we all share It's the hope for tomorrow
[01:55:50.497 --> 01:55:52.497]  Frick yeah!
[01:55:52.497 --> 01:55:54.497]  Ah yeah!
[01:55:55.497 --> 01:55:56.497]  Frick yeah!
[01:55:56.497 --> 01:56:09.497]  Ah yeah!
[01:56:09.497 --> 01:56:11.497]  Ah yeah!
[01:56:12.497 --> 01:56:14.497]  Ah yeah!
[01:56:15.497 --> 01:56:20.497]  All other networks lie to you about what's happening now.
[01:56:20.497 --> 01:56:23.497]  InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:56:23.670 --> 01:56:27.934]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[01:56:27.753 --> 01:56:30.333]  (upbeat music)
[01:56:30.333 --> 01:56:40.193]   All right, I wanna be 100% crystal, absolutely clear here.
[01:56:40.193 --> 01:56:41.753]  We're all made by the creator.
[01:56:41.769 --> 01:56:42.829]  We all have souls.
[01:56:43.410 --> 01:56:48.052]  I don't care if you got dark skin or white skin or where you came from.
[01:56:48.653 --> 01:56:51.574]  I want you to be free and I want to defeat the globalists that want you dead.
[01:56:53.715 --> 01:56:59.178]  But the left has had a long-term project starting back with LBJ.
[01:56:59.198 --> 01:57:00.659]  He even wrote letters admitting it.
[01:57:01.772 --> 01:57:11.476]  That black people were voting Republican, black people were super successful, they had less illegitimacy than white people, because that which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[01:57:11.496 --> 01:57:18.199]  I'm not defending segregation or Jim Crow, but when you know you're oppressed and you're being oppressed, it makes you stronger long term.
[01:57:18.399 --> 01:57:26.642]  You know the saying, bad times make strong men, strong men make good times, good times make weak men, weak men make bad times.
[01:57:28.863 --> 01:57:41.309]   And so they came in and broke up the black family, In the 60s and went from 90-something percent two-family homes or two-parent homes to 70, 80 percent now single-parent homes.
[01:57:41.869 --> 01:57:45.030]  And then who is now going to be the father when there's no father?
[01:57:45.290 --> 01:57:46.031]  It'll be the gangster.
[01:57:46.051 --> 01:57:46.671]  It'll be the thug.
[01:57:46.711 --> 01:57:47.311]  It'll be the criminal.
[01:57:49.092 --> 01:57:50.853]  And so it's been partially declassified.
[01:57:50.873 --> 01:57:52.213]  There's a congressional hearings on it.
[01:57:53.934 --> 01:57:58.896]  The CIA goes in in the early 1980s and they go into Hollywood.
[01:57:58.916 --> 01:58:04.451]   They had a big relationship with, I'll show you articles in a moment, Admitting it all, it's declassified.
[01:58:04.571 --> 01:58:09.173]  People hear, they hear the CIA hijacked hip-hop and created gangster rap.
[01:58:09.974 --> 01:58:11.115]  No, it's on record.
[01:58:12.996 --> 01:58:14.377]  And Ice Cube's now talked about it.
[01:58:14.637 --> 01:58:15.817]  He was there in the meetings.
[01:58:16.198 --> 01:58:18.359]  He said, they told us, yeah, he'd been mentioned to it.
[01:58:18.379 --> 01:58:19.840]  They told us, do this, we want to be boosted.
[01:58:22.181 --> 01:58:23.962]  Say he's a day late, a dollar short, it's better than nothing.
[01:58:24.743 --> 01:58:31.067]  But I've been told this by Dave Mustaine and the Smashing Pumpkins and, you know, all of it.
[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:35.441]  They were there in the 80s and 90s being told, you better get with this or get out.
[01:58:36.241 --> 01:58:46.124]  They said, you either put out thug, gangster, criminal stuff, your own version, supporting crime, supporting thuggism, or you're not going to be promoted on MTV back when it was still big.
[01:58:47.685 --> 01:58:48.945]  Look at the defunding the police now.
[01:58:48.985 --> 01:58:50.306]  Look at mostly peaceful protests.
[01:58:50.326 --> 01:58:51.166]  Look at Antifa.
[01:58:51.186 --> 01:58:53.527]  Look, they want criminal gangs above the law.
[01:58:53.827 --> 01:58:55.047]  Soros defunding the police.
[01:58:55.347 --> 01:59:00.809]  Soros putting in thousands of DAs and judges and dozens of the state attorney generals.
[01:59:01.929 --> 01:59:04.731]  Almost half of them.
[01:59:05.211 --> 01:59:07.313]  Leticia James, the list goes on and on.
[01:59:08.453 --> 01:59:14.377]  So now that you've broken up the family, you don't have fathers in the beta test, the black people, the target, the first group they hit.
[01:59:17.479 --> 01:59:22.042]  Now you go in and you teach gangsterism, thugism.
[01:59:22.302 --> 01:59:25.024]  I go in, I kill everybody, I'm tough, that's what a man does.
[01:59:25.324 --> 01:59:33.545]   And these little kids, three, four, five, six, with no father at home, Are just running around the neighborhood with the gangbangers, with the drug dealers.
[01:59:33.805 --> 01:59:35.046]  And then they're watching the rap.
[01:59:35.526 --> 01:59:36.647]  They're watching the videos.
[01:59:36.687 --> 01:59:38.548]  They're hearing how cool it is to be a thug.
[01:59:39.809 --> 01:59:43.951]  Just like Snoop got paid five years ago to attack Trump and say, I want to kill Trump.
[01:59:44.191 --> 01:59:45.852]  He came out this week and said, I apologize.
[01:59:45.892 --> 01:59:47.293]  Trump's been a good man the whole time.
[01:59:47.593 --> 01:59:48.974]  I shouldn't have said bad things about him.
[01:59:49.715 --> 01:59:51.816]  Oh, finding your soul a little bit, huh?
[01:59:54.502 --> 01:59:57.423]  Now he's like, I'm anti-marijuana, it brain damages you, destroys you.
[01:59:57.663 --> 01:59:58.903]  I'm sorry I push it on kids.
[01:59:58.923 --> 02:00:02.084]  Yeah, the marijuana today is 50 times stronger than it was 30 years ago.
[02:00:02.665 --> 02:00:05.566]  So Snoop's like, I don't smoke pot, you need to watch out.
[02:00:06.346 --> 02:00:08.727]  I care about my family because his kids are getting screwed up by it.
[02:00:08.927 --> 02:00:09.907]  It creates schizophrenia.
[02:00:10.107 --> 02:00:12.988]  I know a bunch of people personally became schizophrenic on marijuana.
[02:00:15.256 --> 02:00:19.439]  Doesn't mean we put everybody in prison, but they need help, they need rehab, they need to be warned about it.
[02:00:19.479 --> 02:00:21.560]  My God, I mean, I told you, I rarely smoke pot.
[02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:24.983]  I literally, like, once a year with Joe Rogan on a show or something, I'll smoke it and see what it does.
[02:00:25.723 --> 02:00:27.084]  Can't even get out of my chair for hours.
[02:00:27.304 --> 02:00:28.225]  One hit off that stuff.
[02:00:28.825 --> 02:00:33.108]  Back when I was in high school, I wasn't a big pot guy, but I'd smoke an air in there, didn't do any of that.
[02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:39.253]  So, Ice Cube comes out and explains this.
[02:00:39.333 --> 02:00:40.814]  So this is an anti-black people.
[02:00:41.154 --> 02:00:42.535]  Black people are the number one victim of this.
[02:00:43.732 --> 02:00:49.134]  But 22 to 1, before Biden got in, now the FBI made the crime statistic secret.
[02:00:52.354 --> 02:00:55.835]  For every white person that attacks a black person, 22 white people get attacked.
[02:00:57.136 --> 02:01:03.938]  And that's because the media says it's free game, open season on white people, reparations, they deserve it.
[02:01:04.678 --> 02:01:07.899]  Kill the cops, kill the white people, the knockout games, all of it.
[02:01:08.851 --> 02:01:10.852]  And when it happens, the media tries to cover it up.
[02:01:11.212 --> 02:01:15.873]  But all of this is part of the destabilization of society and civilization.
[02:01:17.233 --> 02:01:19.414]  So here's Ice Cube talking about it with Bill Maher.
[02:01:19.434 --> 02:01:21.814]  And Bill Maher, as usual, is being an apologist for it.
[02:01:22.094 --> 02:01:22.494]  Here it is.
[02:01:22.975 --> 02:01:25.335]  Same people who own the labels own the prisons.
[02:01:25.775 --> 02:01:26.876]  Literally the same people?
[02:01:27.216 --> 02:01:31.697]  Literally the same people who own the labels own private prisons.
[02:01:31.997 --> 02:01:38.259]   The records that come out are really geared to push People towards their prison industry.
[02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:41.101]  But they didn't make you write those lyrics.
[02:01:41.222 --> 02:01:43.703]  It's not about making somebody write the lyrics.
[02:01:44.304 --> 02:01:51.229]  It's about being there as guardrails to make sure certain songs make it through and certain songs don't.
[02:01:51.469 --> 02:01:53.091]  Some records are made by committee.
[02:01:53.871 --> 02:02:00.336]  Meaning, record company guys sit around and tell the artists, this is hot, say that, do this.
[02:02:00.356 --> 02:02:02.398]  We're gonna have this guy write the lyrics.
[02:02:02.938 --> 02:02:03.679]  We're gonna have that.
[02:02:04.059 --> 02:02:06.961]  You have, you know, the record company pushing the narrative.
[02:02:07.222 --> 02:02:13.206]  You know, some social engineering going on here to make sure those prisons stay full.
[02:02:14.147 --> 02:02:19.631]  I see people like Charlemagne Tha God on his popular show saying, black people are dominating.
[02:02:19.671 --> 02:02:20.612]  We're the most powerful.
[02:02:20.652 --> 02:02:21.312]  We're the greatest.
[02:02:21.352 --> 02:02:23.274]  Look how all the corporate sponsors are us.
[02:02:23.594 --> 02:02:27.097]  And I wish black people successes, rocket scientists, brain surgeons, whatever.
[02:02:27.417 --> 02:02:31.861]  But now the corporate media, almost every corporate spokesperson is a black person.
[02:02:33.004 --> 02:02:35.746]  To push the evil globalist agenda with a black face on it.
[02:02:36.787 --> 02:02:38.829]  So they're done wrecking the black community.
[02:02:38.869 --> 02:02:40.290]  They've destroyed the hell out of it.
[02:02:41.491 --> 02:02:44.093]  Blacks that have survived it have been incredibly tough and more power to them.
[02:02:46.034 --> 02:02:50.518]  But now they've fully weaponized it and are using the same gangster culture everywhere.
[02:02:50.538 --> 02:02:57.944]  I mean, I remember when Hollywood tried to recruit me 20 years ago and I'd go out and be in a movie or whatever, and like the director would have thug life on him, be a white guy.
[02:02:57.964 --> 02:03:01.307]  One of them was the son of a super famous director.
[02:03:02.478 --> 02:03:20.920]  He was a big director and does movies with Denzel Washington and he's all talking like a thug and talking about killing cops and stuff and we're sitting up on this big beautiful place with a butler feeding us filet mignon and chicks in bikinis giving them massages, not me.
[02:03:22.679 --> 02:03:24.340]  I'm like, oh, kill the cops, okay.
[02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:26.721]  But that is the culture.
[02:03:27.622 --> 02:03:30.463]  That is what we're talking about to destabilize everything.
[02:03:31.224 --> 02:03:32.524]  So let's go to this latest clip.
[02:03:33.465 --> 02:03:35.126]  And I see dozens of these every day.
[02:03:35.506 --> 02:03:39.748]  Here's a white kid, went over to a party house he thought he was going there, shows up.
[02:03:39.788 --> 02:03:40.709]  What are you doing here, kid?
[02:03:41.149 --> 02:03:41.930]  He thinks he's cool.
[02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:44.171]  You know, he's got his own white afro, whatever.
[02:03:44.831 --> 02:03:47.973]  Gets beat to death and taken out and thrown in the street like a dog to die.
[02:03:49.175 --> 02:03:52.637]  Got a bunch of examples of this, but this is the extension of that.
[02:03:52.997 --> 02:03:54.198]  And this is what the left wants.
[02:03:54.038 --> 02:04:13.958]   here it is. And one more kick in the head and he starts bleeding out and dies.
[02:04:12.569 --> 02:04:14.831]  They just take him out like trash and just throw him in the backyard.
[02:04:18.183 --> 02:04:20.804]  And then they go to prison for five years and get back out and do it again.
[02:04:23.984 --> 02:04:32.966]  And they videotape it and post it themselves, like seven gay men gang rape two toddlers in shopping mall restroom, blood all over the walls.
[02:04:34.406 --> 02:04:37.547]  And they post it and they're now saying, we're gay, it's okay, we rape babies.
[02:04:40.927 --> 02:04:44.088]  It's just total lawlessness, total criminal activity.
[02:04:46.610 --> 02:04:49.553]  Look, Cheryl Atkinson, we talk a lot about, just broke this.
[02:04:50.513 --> 02:04:56.638]  Twelve-year-old, two teens indicted for first-degree murder and shooting that left three teens dead in Marion County.
[02:04:58.599 --> 02:05:00.460]  Three white kids thought they were gangsters.
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:01.461]  They thought they were cool.
[02:05:01.501 --> 02:05:06.465]  They went and joined the three black kids and thought they were going to go out and rob people for marijuana money.
[02:05:07.185 --> 02:05:11.048]  Instead, they all got robbed and lined up against a wall and shot in the back of the head.
[02:05:13.462 --> 02:05:15.784]  What is producing this culture?
[02:05:18.306 --> 02:05:22.449]  Boys ages 12 to 17 accused of killing three Marion teens.
[02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:23.130]  $10,000 reward.
[02:05:24.251 --> 02:05:27.413]  Third suspect arrested in murders of three teenagers in Marion County.
[02:05:28.114 --> 02:05:28.914]  They think it's tough.
[02:05:29.595 --> 02:05:30.415]  They think it's cool.
[02:05:30.656 --> 02:05:32.997]  Because the CIA said so.
[02:05:33.298 --> 02:05:34.018]  And then it gets worse.
[02:05:34.278 --> 02:05:35.860]  Let's play these two clips back to back.
[02:05:37.523 --> 02:05:46.566]  This is national television, law and order, where a woman is raped by a black teenager and she says, don't prosecute him, it's not his fault.
[02:05:47.086 --> 02:05:50.147]  And then the whole show is about how good it is to be raped because you're white.
[02:05:50.707 --> 02:05:58.329]  Again, they're trying to get black people to watch this and think it's legitimate to go out and do this so they can later set all the black people up like they've already done.
[02:05:58.389 --> 02:05:58.969]  Let's continue.
[02:06:01.330 --> 02:06:03.991]  But Natalie, Jay Watson raped you.
[02:06:04.011 --> 02:06:07.212]  You think I forgot?
[02:06:09.534 --> 02:06:13.096]  This entire trial has been an exercise in reminding me.
[02:06:13.557 --> 02:06:15.558]  And this is your chance to do something about it.
[02:06:15.858 --> 02:06:16.839]  I am going to.
[02:06:17.459 --> 02:06:18.220]  Believe me.
[02:06:19.180 --> 02:06:20.341]  Because I can.
[02:06:20.561 --> 02:06:21.802]  I can afford therapy.
[02:06:21.982 --> 02:06:23.123]  I have that luxury.
[02:06:23.383 --> 02:06:28.586]  And maybe, one day, I'll be okay.
[02:06:30.047 --> 02:06:37.607]   But if that teenager goes to prison, he may not be.
[02:06:37.607 --> 02:06:40.107]  Ever.
[02:06:40.107 --> 02:06:47.807]  I don't want that.
[02:06:47.807 --> 02:06:51.744]   *cough* Natalie, wait.
[02:06:54.166 --> 02:06:55.146]  I'm listening, Mr. Carter.
[02:06:56.788 --> 02:06:57.348]  Go ahead, Jay.
[02:07:00.871 --> 02:07:05.855]  That girl, Natalie, I did what she said.
[02:07:06.835 --> 02:07:08.835]  She ain't lying.
[02:07:08.835 --> 02:07:11.435]  Okay.
[02:07:11.435 --> 02:07:20.934]  I took something.
[02:07:20.934 --> 02:07:23.234]  Something I can't get back.
[02:07:23.234 --> 02:07:24.734]  (dramatic music)
[02:07:24.813 --> 02:07:26.153]  It was just supposed to be a robbery.
[02:07:27.094 --> 02:07:33.416]  But, when I saw her, my whole life... Hey, pause, back it up.
[02:07:34.337 --> 02:07:35.557]  Oh, it was just a robbery.
[02:07:36.057 --> 02:07:37.478]  Of course, they let him go on the show.
[02:07:37.498 --> 02:07:40.459]  So he can... In the real world, he goes out and does it over and over again.
[02:07:40.880 --> 02:07:42.580]  You wonder what the Soros brainwashing is.
[02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:43.501]  This is it, folks.
[02:07:44.121 --> 02:07:44.681]  Let's continue.
[02:07:48.023 --> 02:07:48.643]  I took something.
[02:07:50.279 --> 02:07:51.240]  Something I can't get back.
[02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:53.542]  But with no proof on Trump, $80 million.
[02:07:53.682 --> 02:07:55.003]  It was supposed to be a robbery.
[02:07:56.004 --> 02:08:03.149]  But, when I saw her, my whole life, nobody paid attention to anything I did.
[02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:05.912]  Not at home, not at school.
[02:08:07.293 --> 02:08:09.354]  Always felt kinda invisible.
[02:08:09.534 --> 02:08:10.936]  She needed a raper, you know, it's liberal.
[02:08:12.257 --> 02:08:14.038]  So, why would this be any different?
[02:08:17.901 --> 02:08:21.857]   What I did to Natalie, I did.
[02:08:23.358 --> 02:08:24.358]  Changed her life forever.
[02:08:25.518 --> 02:08:27.219]  This is so sick, folks.
[02:08:28.399 --> 02:08:32.021]  So... I guess I finally learned my lesson.
[02:08:32.261 --> 02:08:34.182]  Oh, how beautiful.
[02:08:34.202 --> 02:08:41.224]  It's just too late.
[02:08:41.324 --> 02:08:42.625]  It's never too late, Mr. Watson.
[02:08:42.925 --> 02:08:43.825]  It's okay, you raped her.
[02:08:44.665 --> 02:08:45.245]  And robbed her.
[02:08:45.265 --> 02:08:45.626]  It's liberal.
[02:08:45.646 --> 02:08:46.186]  I'll do time.
[02:08:47.128 --> 02:08:50.932]  Pfizer will inject you to her.
[02:08:51.492 --> 02:08:52.053]  Oh, good.
[02:08:53.334 --> 02:08:56.937]  Good job, rapist.
[02:08:57.678 --> 02:08:58.198]  That's right.
[02:08:58.839 --> 02:09:00.220]  You arm robbed her and you raped her.
[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:00.781]  How liberal.
[02:09:02.542 --> 02:09:03.964]  She's a white devil.
[02:09:05.165 --> 02:09:05.605]  Good job.
[02:09:05.625 --> 02:09:06.426]  You raped a white devil.
[02:09:08.948 --> 02:09:10.149]  That's who Hollywood is, folks.
[02:09:10.169 --> 02:09:12.632]  They want your daughters raped by anybody.
[02:09:14.158 --> 02:09:15.599]  These are enemies of humanity.
[02:09:15.759 --> 02:09:17.299]  The people running Hollywood are the enemy.
[02:09:17.539 --> 02:09:18.320]  They're the ones doing it.
[02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:19.460]  Let's look at this now.
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:21.021]  I told you it's CIA.
[02:09:21.241 --> 02:09:25.103]  Let me just show you a bunch of documents, articles, congressional reports right here.
[02:09:25.143 --> 02:09:26.103]  Let's look at it right now together.
[02:09:27.344 --> 02:09:29.945]  Iran contra crack cocaine and the transformation of hip-hop.
[02:09:30.785 --> 02:09:31.425]  Huge report.
[02:09:32.866 --> 02:09:37.328]  Former music execs describe the scary meeting that resulted in today's violent rap music.
[02:09:38.607 --> 02:09:39.488]  All mainstream news.
[02:09:39.628 --> 02:09:40.368]  Business Insider.
[02:09:41.169 --> 02:09:44.792]  How a hip-hop conspiracy theory sheds light on the cracks in American justice.
[02:09:46.613 --> 02:09:47.794]  Hip-hop and the FBI.
[02:09:47.834 --> 02:09:48.915]  History of COINTELPRO.
[02:09:52.478 --> 02:09:53.238]  Fugus members.
[02:09:53.859 --> 02:09:54.219]  Press.
[02:09:54.279 --> 02:09:57.121]  Michael found guilty in federal conspiracy order with the FBI.
[02:09:57.422 --> 02:09:58.222]  Setting up hip-hop.
[02:09:59.343 --> 02:10:00.084]  Wind of change.
[02:10:00.104 --> 02:10:02.345]  Did the CIA write the Cold War's biggest anthem?
[02:10:02.385 --> 02:10:02.906]  Yes, they did.
[02:10:04.287 --> 02:10:04.407]  U.S.
[02:10:04.447 --> 02:10:08.409]  attempts to infiltrate Cuban hip-hop is not unprecedented.
[02:10:09.390 --> 02:10:09.950]  Al Jazeera.
[02:10:11.511 --> 02:10:13.172]  CIA and Radio Free Europe.
[02:10:15.073 --> 02:10:18.674]  Jazz, Spies and Games, the extraordinary life of CIA founding member.
[02:10:20.835 --> 02:10:20.976]  U.S.
[02:10:20.996 --> 02:10:23.417]  co-opted Cuba's hip-hop scene to spark change.
[02:10:23.617 --> 02:10:23.997]  AP.
[02:10:25.338 --> 02:10:26.778]  CIA create the hippies.
[02:10:28.839 --> 02:10:30.240]  And it goes on from there.
[02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:33.542]  The whole thing is run just like Ice Cube said.
[02:10:35.458 --> 02:10:40.319]  And they got all these Soros DAs out there saying, hey, you raped a white woman, you shot a white liquor store owner.
[02:10:40.439 --> 02:10:41.299]  It's okay, man.
[02:10:41.579 --> 02:10:42.079]  We understand.
[02:10:42.099 --> 02:10:43.099]  They deserve to die.
[02:10:43.579 --> 02:10:49.601]  They're just legalizing all of this and trying to get young black people to go out and think it's okay to do.
[02:10:50.821 --> 02:10:52.521]  Black Lives Matter, mostly peaceful.
[02:10:54.041 --> 02:10:54.401]  All of it.
[02:10:54.441 --> 02:10:55.122]  We're going to break.
[02:10:55.382 --> 02:10:56.202]  I need your support.
[02:10:57.522 --> 02:11:02.363]  Hour number three is going to be power-packed with a special guest on what's really happening with World War III in the Middle East right now.
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:04.621]  We got two new t-shirts in.
[02:11:04.781 --> 02:11:05.682]  I designed this baby.
[02:11:05.742 --> 02:11:06.442]  I'm very proud of it.
[02:11:06.462 --> 02:11:12.387]  It's a big ol' 1776 Gadsden flag with the rattlesnake, don't tread on me, red, white, and blue.
[02:11:12.867 --> 02:11:18.151]  And on one side it's got an American flag on one arm, and on the other arm it's got a great design.
[02:11:18.171 --> 02:11:20.793]  We'll put that design up if we can at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:11:21.254 --> 02:11:22.675]  InfoWars established 1996, Molon Labe.
[02:11:27.256 --> 02:11:28.837]  InfoWars was established in 1996.
[02:11:28.957 --> 02:11:29.878]  I got on air before that.
[02:11:30.679 --> 02:11:36.823]  In the new shirt, the 1776 limited edition, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:11:37.324 --> 02:11:40.526]  And we have the new Team Humanity limited edition t-shirts as well.
[02:11:40.866 --> 02:11:41.947]  We need your support.
[02:11:42.488 --> 02:11:43.669]  Get the shirts now.
[02:11:43.929 --> 02:11:45.310]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:11:45.710 --> 02:11:47.151]  And thanks for keeping us on air.
[02:11:47.852 --> 02:11:49.153]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:11:51.052 --> 02:12:00.409]  You know, I sit up here and I yell and scream about the New World Order and the globalists, they're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab, and you saw it all come true.
[02:12:01.531 --> 02:12:02.272]  But there's a...
[02:12:03.388 --> 02:12:04.168]  Inverse of that.
[02:12:04.909 --> 02:12:09.890]  There's not just the bad stuff I'm telling you about, there's the good stuff I'm telling you about.
[02:12:10.671 --> 02:12:15.312]  And just like our information is the best you're going to find out there, our supplements are amazing.
[02:12:15.953 --> 02:12:19.714]  So our new special in the last half of January 2024 is here.

[02:12:24.736 --> 02:12:27.797]  We're calling it the Supercharged Special.
[02:12:28.477 --> 02:12:34.302]  You can get either one of these great items at 40% off individually or together for 50% off.
[02:12:34.602 --> 02:12:38.506]  Now, in the time we have left, I can't tell you why they're so great and what they do for your body.
[02:12:38.906 --> 02:12:43.650]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com, look at the ingredients, and investigate it, and then get them.
[02:12:43.930 --> 02:12:46.452]  It supports the InfoWar, and it'll change your life.
[02:12:47.033 --> 02:12:47.833]  Take advantage now.
[02:12:47.853 --> 02:12:48.774]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:12:48.854 --> 02:12:53.338]  All right, there's huge calls for full-on war in the Middle East.
[02:12:53.998 --> 02:12:56.660]  Syrian Girl will be joining us to break it down.
[02:12:57.608 --> 02:12:59.470]  Really smart lady coming up.
[02:12:59.490 --> 02:13:11.525]  But I wanted to air a little bit of what's happening in Atlanta, where Antifa is not just burning down new police stations and new police training facilities, they're now attacking any construction site that the companies building the police station are involved in.
[02:13:11.865 --> 02:13:13.668]  True terrorism, but it's not being called that.
[02:13:14.974 --> 02:13:16.735]  Another arson attack in Atlanta.
[02:13:16.876 --> 02:13:22.720]  Yeah, this one is more than two dozen attacks police say are tied to opponents of the Public Safety Training Center.
[02:13:23.121 --> 02:13:27.985]  Someone lit construction equipment on fire at a townhome development near Grant Park.
[02:13:28.145 --> 02:13:29.406]  This is in southeast Atlanta.
[02:13:29.726 --> 02:13:31.627]  Atlanta News First reporter Patrick Quinn is there now.
[02:13:31.688 --> 02:13:35.150]  And Patrick, you're about four miles away from the training center site.
[02:13:35.230 --> 02:13:38.133]  Do we know why this particular area was targeted?
[02:13:40.669 --> 02:13:47.831]  Sean, just within the last hour, an anonymous group claimed responsibility for setting this construction equipment on fire.
[02:13:48.051 --> 02:13:59.674]  Online, this group says they are opposed to the building of the Public Safety Training Center, and they said that they targeted this specific project because the contractor involved is also building that training facility.
[02:13:59.934 --> 02:14:06.076]  I talked with officials from Brent Scarborough & Company, that is that contractor, they confirmed they are building the training facility.
[02:14:06.195 --> 02:14:09.876]   They told me today this is not the first time their projects have been targeted.
[02:14:09.876 --> 02:14:15.315]  We'll tell you if our head's in fear. Go for engine 10.
[02:14:15.315 --> 02:14:17.155]  Chard Construction Equipment.
[02:14:17.428 --> 02:14:23.396]  Around 530 in the morning, fire crews rushed to this townhome development under construction in southeast Atlanta.
[02:14:23.456 --> 02:14:25.439]  Got an excavator and four doors.
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:27.882]  Got both involved.
[02:14:28.583 --> 02:14:29.684]  Got water on them now.
[02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:34.616]  This is absolutely horrendous, and we have to get to the bottom of this.
[02:14:34.896 --> 02:14:44.807]  In the last year and a half, according to city officials, there have now been 24 arson attacks, damaging at least 85 pieces of construction equipment, spanning 23 states.
[02:14:45.188 --> 02:14:49.513]  They say are all tied to the movement against the building of Atlanta's Public Safety Training Center.
[02:14:49.673 --> 02:14:52.757]  They don't care about life, and they certainly don't care about the safety of Atlantans.
[02:14:52.977 --> 02:14:58.203]  Police Chief Darren Shearbaum last week announced a nationwide campaign to find these alleged arsonists.
[02:14:58.664 --> 02:15:02.548]  The city's setting up more than 450 billboards in eight different U.S.
[02:15:02.589 --> 02:15:06.433]  cities, asking for the public's help to track down those responsible.
[02:15:06.774 --> 02:15:07.695]  And they are going to be stopped.
[02:15:08.195 --> 02:15:13.619]  On site, an official with Brent Scarborough & Company confirmed they are involved in the building of the training facility.
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:18.083]  And this is not their first time their unrelated projects have been targeted.
[02:15:18.163 --> 02:15:19.484]  About 5.30 a.m.
[02:15:20.125 --> 02:15:22.406]  on Burroughs Street in Southeast Atlanta.
[02:15:22.987 --> 02:15:30.973]  Atlanta Fire Rescue as well as APB responded to the scene to find construction equipment that had been set afire.
[02:15:32.114 --> 02:15:36.795]  It is currently under investigation, so we are very limited what we can share with you right now.
[02:15:36.855 --> 02:15:41.436]  However, if you look over my shoulder, you will see the equipment that was burned.
[02:15:41.556 --> 02:15:43.956]  It belongs to a private contractor.
[02:15:44.376 --> 02:15:50.477]  More importantly, I need to drive home the point that we are in the communities of the city of Atlanta.
[02:15:50.517 --> 02:15:57.699]  We are close to private homes where families live, and we have arson events that are occurring.
[02:15:58.359 --> 02:15:59.299]  And this has got to stop.
[02:16:00.515 --> 02:16:05.038]  We really need your assistance to help us in this investigation.
[02:16:05.078 --> 02:16:10.482]  We're here with our partners from APD, ATF, as well as GBI.
[02:16:11.123 --> 02:16:16.707]  And we are having an ongoing investigation and we're trying to get to the bottom of this situation.
[02:16:17.288 --> 02:16:22.116]   So if anyone has seen anything, Please look at your rain cameras.
[02:16:22.676 --> 02:16:23.596]  Please come forward.
[02:16:24.156 --> 02:16:27.618]  We need you to contact us utilizing Crimestoppers.
[02:16:28.178 --> 02:16:29.418]  We need your assistance.
[02:16:29.959 --> 02:16:34.700]  This is absolutely horrendous and we have to get to the bottom of this.
[02:16:35.601 --> 02:16:38.222]  We'll have a few words from our Police Chief if he wants to say anything.
[02:16:38.462 --> 02:16:39.262]  Thank you, Chief Smith.
[02:16:39.282 --> 02:16:39.762]  Appreciate it.
[02:16:39.782 --> 02:16:40.763]  Good morning, everyone.
[02:16:40.983 --> 02:16:43.484]  Always appreciate your role in informing our communities.
[02:16:44.364 --> 02:16:46.025]  As the Chief said, this has got to stop.
[02:16:46.985 --> 02:16:48.766]  Early indication is this arson attack.
[02:16:49.466 --> 02:16:54.012]  Along with many others, is targeted at a construction company that is building the Public Safety Training Center.
[02:16:54.592 --> 02:16:59.158]  And early indications are this arson attack is an attempt to stop that investment of the safety of Atlanta.
[02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:07.729]  There is a reward for up to $200,000 that is in place for information that leads to the arrest and the conviction of the arson or arsonists that are at play.
[02:17:09.252 --> 02:17:14.534]  Citizens that are watching your news broadcasts or reading on your online content, we ask them to join us.
[02:17:14.934 --> 02:17:18.236]  We are here with the ATF and the GBI and the FBI, but we need your assistance.
[02:17:18.676 --> 02:17:26.239]  There's likely someone that's watching this news report now that has ring camera that is critical and is key to helping us arrest this individual.
[02:17:26.779 --> 02:17:31.401]  If this individual or individuals are not stopped soon, they are likely to cost someone their life.
[02:17:32.141 --> 02:17:34.242]  This is not an attack that is limited to Bearl Street.
[02:17:34.782 --> 02:17:41.782]   This attack today impacts every citizen of Atlanta and everyone in the country.
[02:17:41.782 --> 02:17:48.582]   Well, President Trump warns there's a 100% chance of a major terror attack.
[02:17:48.557 --> 02:17:50.699]  Our borders are wide open.
[02:17:52.300 --> 02:17:57.603]  Biden gave $6 billion a month before Hamas attacked Israel.
[02:17:58.844 --> 02:18:00.145]  We knew Hezbollah was backing it.
[02:18:00.185 --> 02:18:01.446]  Now Hezbollah has admitted that.
[02:18:02.677 --> 02:18:08.199]  Now you've got attacks in the Red Sea by the Houthi rebels out of Yemen.
[02:18:08.399 --> 02:18:10.960]  You've got this attack on a U.S.
[02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:13.080]  base in Jordan out of Syria.
[02:18:13.801 --> 02:18:15.701]  Syrian girl was not a backer of Assad.
[02:18:15.981 --> 02:18:21.343]  Her family, she's a well-known journalist, was purged by him and actually kicked out.
[02:18:21.363 --> 02:18:22.423]  That's why she lives in Australia.
[02:18:22.764 --> 02:18:26.645]  She's a scientist herself and has been a frequent guest with us over the years.
[02:18:28.015 --> 02:18:39.063]  She's a journalist covering geopolitics and so much more, but I wanted to get her on to talk about this because from all our sources, Iran sent nuclear weapons, atomic bombs, at least for decades.
[02:18:39.704 --> 02:18:50.832]  Now, even mainstream news, I covered this last night, is now admitting that Iran does have them, just like Israel denies they have them, but they do have them.
[02:18:52.619 --> 02:18:53.961]  We have the war with Russia.
[02:18:54.121 --> 02:18:55.122]  That's not going well.
[02:18:55.182 --> 02:18:58.546]  So they've pivoted out of Ukraine into the Middle East.
[02:18:59.127 --> 02:19:01.149]  This is escalating very, very rapidly.
[02:19:01.170 --> 02:19:04.894]  So regardless of what side you're on, I'm on the side of stopping nuclear war.
[02:19:06.316 --> 02:19:11.943]  It's very important to walk through the different scenarios of what Iran may do if they get struck.
[02:19:13.342 --> 02:19:15.865]  Just like I walked through, could Israel actually take Gaza?
[02:19:16.125 --> 02:19:17.947]  Could they carpet bomb the whole place and win?
[02:19:18.187 --> 02:19:19.648]  That wasn't me calling for carpet bombing.
[02:19:19.688 --> 02:19:24.453]  That was me walking through, could they even defeat Hamas in that area?
[02:19:24.473 --> 02:19:25.534]  Which I don't think they could.
[02:19:25.875 --> 02:19:28.457]  And I said it would be a major political disaster for them.
[02:19:28.477 --> 02:19:31.860]  But we're going to war game all this and look at all the angles of it.
[02:19:32.581 --> 02:19:35.402]  But this is a very serious situation.
[02:19:36.002 --> 02:19:40.924]  Biden given chilling nuclear warning over attacking Iran with kamikaze drones.
[02:19:40.964 --> 02:19:44.705]  Former UN inspector David Albright says they've already got nuclear weapons.
[02:19:45.185 --> 02:19:47.946]  The question is have they loaded them on to missiles?
[02:19:48.066 --> 02:19:52.227]  And I showed you the Washington Times and I showed you others reporting the same thing.
[02:19:52.687 --> 02:19:55.948]  So Syrian girl, you're really an expert on that area of the world.
[02:19:56.568 --> 02:19:58.369]  I'm going to skip this break so you have the floor.
[02:19:59.944 --> 02:20:02.547]  And so don't pause unless you want me to interrupt.
[02:20:03.068 --> 02:20:04.930]  But just you can start in the history of this.
[02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:06.111]  You can start what's currently happening.
[02:20:06.872 --> 02:20:09.595]  But my big concern is this escalation is very obvious.
[02:20:09.955 --> 02:20:11.577]  It's what the globalists want ahead of the U.S.
[02:20:11.677 --> 02:20:12.157]  election.
[02:20:12.578 --> 02:20:14.960]  The end of the old monetary system is coming to an end.
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:16.902]  The dollar, they're rolling out everywhere.
[02:20:16.922 --> 02:20:18.364]  The central bank digital currencies.
[02:20:18.684 --> 02:20:25.788]  And every time they bring in a whole new order, there's a major war, and of course the big issue is the nuclear weapons mixed into the situation.
[02:20:26.128 --> 02:20:35.073]  So Syrian Girl on Twitter, at Partisan Girl on YouTube, Syrian Girl Partisan on Telegram, Syrian Partisan, or just search Syrian Girl.
[02:20:35.433 --> 02:20:36.694]  Syrian Girl, thanks for joining us.
[02:20:37.688 --> 02:20:38.308]  Thank you so much.
[02:20:38.328 --> 02:20:40.169]  I'm really glad to be here, Alex.
[02:20:40.229 --> 02:20:42.670]  And I'm so glad to see you're back on Twitter.
[02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:44.811]  Sorry, that was the first thing I wanted to say.
[02:20:44.831 --> 02:20:46.972]  Twitter has missed you a lot.
[02:20:47.332 --> 02:20:50.394]  And I'm so glad we have a win for free speech.
[02:20:51.334 --> 02:20:53.715]  And I'm always honoured to be here.
[02:20:54.916 --> 02:20:56.416]  So I am from Syria.
[02:20:56.636 --> 02:21:28.839]   So I would like to caveat that, of course, we have our own Views on Israel and very quickly the history of Israel in the region, you know as from Syria's perspective We see Israel as an existential threat Because essentially it was set up like the Jewish state in our region in the Levant in the same similar way to how the Islamic state in the Levant was set up in the sense that it was had a lot of foreign investment and
[02:21:29.179 --> 02:21:34.863]  A lot of foreigners coming in, illegal immigration, some of them were armed, some of them were doing terrorist attacks.
[02:21:35.263 --> 02:21:39.245]  They were doing terrorist attacks against even the English occupation in Palestine.
[02:21:39.565 --> 02:21:48.711]  At the time, you know, in 1920 for example, Syria had actually declared independence and that region actually included Palestine.
[02:21:49.211 --> 02:22:16.751]  So we see that as sort of part of the Levant people, and when that happened, the French and the English invaded, they kind of split it up, there was the Balfour Declaration, they created this Jewish state, and they have nuclear weapons, as you said yourself, and they have something called the Samson Option, which if you want to threaten them, they have this sort of taking the world hostage with nuclear weapons.
[02:22:17.604 --> 02:22:19.706]  Now, I kind of agree with what you said earlier.
[02:22:20.187 --> 02:22:24.550]  I personally think that Iran does have nuclear weapons already.
[02:22:25.091 --> 02:22:30.816]  And the reason I believe that is because the way that they're posturing.
[02:22:32.697 --> 02:22:34.419]  I think we have maybe some technical difficulties.
[02:22:34.479 --> 02:22:34.979]  Is that correct?
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.542]  You had a little bit of a glitch, but I'm listening to every word you're saying.
[02:22:38.562 --> 02:22:39.203]  I want to be clear.
[02:22:39.643 --> 02:22:40.664]  You've got the floor here.
[02:22:40.684 --> 02:22:42.285]  You can say whatever you want about Israel.
[02:22:42.305 --> 02:22:43.767]  Anybody else, we're all about free speech.
[02:22:46.562 --> 02:22:50.464]  I've changed the internet connection to maybe a more stable one now.
[02:22:50.504 --> 02:22:51.364]  No, no, you're doing it.
[02:22:51.605 --> 02:22:52.405]  Not much cut out.
[02:22:52.485 --> 02:22:54.706]  It might have cut out for you, but it didn't cut out.
[02:22:54.766 --> 02:22:58.228]  So you were saying, look, I know Iran has nuclear weapons.
[02:22:58.248 --> 02:22:58.888]  I'll leave it at that.
[02:22:59.248 --> 02:23:00.409]  I've said it for 15 years.
[02:23:00.449 --> 02:23:01.229]  I'll just stop there.
[02:23:01.469 --> 02:23:02.550]  But just continue.
[02:23:04.731 --> 02:23:06.312]  Well, I'd have to take your word.
[02:23:06.552 --> 02:23:08.052]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:23:08.353 --> 02:23:12.375]  But as far as what I can see, the way that the U.S.
[02:23:12.455 --> 02:23:23.512]   is treating Iran, the way that the posturing is happening, I think, to me, it's clear that they have something on their sleeve, something powerful, something that will counterbalance Israel's nuclear weapons.
[02:23:23.852 --> 02:23:35.717]  And if you notice, Netanyahu, he really, really pushed for the Iraq War, and that went through fine, because it was after Iraq was disarmed of chemical weapons.
[02:23:36.198 --> 02:23:44.280]   An invasion will not happen until after someone is disarmed of weapons of mass destruction, Same thing happened in Libya, same thing happened in Syria.
[02:23:44.901 --> 02:23:47.222]  Netanyahu has been pushing the U.S.
[02:23:47.262 --> 02:23:50.845]  to go to war with Iran for 20 years and it hasn't happened.
[02:23:51.426 --> 02:24:00.333]  And now it's come to this point where, okay, they'll go to war with the Houthis for Israel, but they're not going to go to war with Iran because it would be catastrophic.
[02:24:00.713 --> 02:24:08.239]  However, you know, there's a lot of people with a lot of influence in the United States, especially in the military-industrial complex, that would like to see that happen.
[02:24:08.719 --> 02:24:18.926]  Now, when it comes to Syria, you know, the US is occupying Syria's oil fields, and that base, it's called Al-Tanf Air Base that was struck.
[02:24:19.547 --> 02:24:21.968]  Most of it was actually inside Syria.
[02:24:22.549 --> 02:24:30.474]  If you guys would like to have a look at the map, it's on the border of Jordan and Syria, and the vast majority of it is in Syria.
[02:24:30.935 --> 02:24:36.999]  And Jordan has came out with a statement that it wasn't on their side that it was struck.
[02:24:37.439 --> 02:24:42.083]  Now, the reason why that is, is because they don't want to be roped into a war, either.
[02:24:42.183 --> 02:24:44.945]  And they don't want to, like, get into this thing right now.
[02:24:44.965 --> 02:24:46.607]  It's a very unstable situation.
[02:24:47.448 --> 02:24:53.032]  So, this is all happening because of Gaza, because of the genocide.
[02:24:53.072 --> 02:25:02.340]  And the reason we call it a genocide is because the Israelis have stated themselves that they want to push all the Palestinians out and into the deserts of Egypt.
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:14.829]  Because they don't want to have a demographic equal, like, at the moment there's in, like, that area, Israel-Palestine, there is 6 million Jews and there's 6 million Palestinians.
[02:25:15.170 --> 02:25:22.755]  Now there's 2 million of them in Gaza and they just want to get rid of them so that they can have a demographic majority by their own admissions, essentially.
[02:25:23.156 --> 02:25:27.759]  And that's what we're facing here and that's where the chaos is accelerating from.
[02:25:30.101 --> 02:25:31.162]  I'm listening to you, continue.
[02:25:32.702 --> 02:25:33.703]  Okay, sure thing.
[02:25:34.223 --> 02:25:35.564]  I didn't want to ramble too much.
[02:25:35.904 --> 02:25:37.745]  But yes, there's Al-Tanf Air Base.
[02:25:37.805 --> 02:25:44.049]  If you guys remember, and I'll probably try to send... I'll probably try to put it on the top of my Twitter account as well.
[02:25:45.369 --> 02:25:49.332]  That was the base where a lot of those... Do you guys remember the Free Syrian Army?
[02:25:49.632 --> 02:25:50.793]  The Al-Qaeda link?
[02:25:50.853 --> 02:25:51.753]  That's where I was going next.
[02:25:51.793 --> 02:25:52.634]  I didn't want to interrupt.
[02:25:53.414 --> 02:25:54.575]  I love my government.
[02:25:54.935 --> 02:25:55.715]  I love my country.
[02:25:55.735 --> 02:25:57.636]  I don't love the criminals that have hijacked my government.
[02:25:58.076 --> 02:25:58.876]  Okay, let's be clear.
[02:25:58.916 --> 02:26:00.577]  It's like if I'm on a plane, a hijacker hijacks.
[02:26:00.597 --> 02:26:03.278]  I don't hate the pilot or the plane I had who hijacked it.
[02:26:03.298 --> 02:26:03.939]  I love my country.
[02:26:04.479 --> 02:26:11.102]  But under Obama and the rest of it, and then Trump got it, he kind of halfway stopped it, and then Russia won the war with the Syrians.
[02:26:11.122 --> 02:26:16.384]  For those who don't know, our government backed ISIS, which was just Al Qaeda, under another name.
[02:26:18.496 --> 02:26:19.096]  Absolutely!
[02:26:19.477 --> 02:26:21.758]  And they were working with them on that border.
[02:26:21.818 --> 02:26:28.101]  I mean, it wasn't just ISIS, also with Al-Qaeda, Jabhat al-Nusra is what they called themselves.
[02:26:29.302 --> 02:26:33.344]  And, you know, there's photos of them.
[02:26:33.424 --> 02:26:42.189]  I just tweeted a photo of them together at that base, as a reply to your tweet about this live.
[02:26:42.869 --> 02:26:45.530]  And it's pinned to the top of my Twitter account as well.
[02:26:46.571 --> 02:26:51.852]  So I just wanted to, you know, point out that this is the context.
[02:26:51.872 --> 02:27:16.881]   So the purpose of that base next to Syria was to try to defeat the Syrian government and install this, like, Islamic sort of Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Qaeda linked group and the reason for that is because they hated the Shiites and that way Syria and Iran could no longer be allies and could no longer pose a threat to Israel essentially.
[02:27:17.161 --> 02:27:19.703]  Like that was the calculus, that's why they were doing that.
[02:27:19.743 --> 02:27:24.387]  Of course they were defeated but what remains is that base.
[02:27:25.007 --> 02:27:31.731]  And, you know, they're there illegally, but there's also other bases in Syria that are occupying all the oil fields.
[02:27:32.451 --> 02:27:54.526]   And the problem is, you know, at the moment the American soldiers there are in a very precarious position, because not only are they, you know, facing threats from the Iraqi resistance groups, because Syria is not going to act out as a state at the moment because obviously they're not going to go up against the US Army unless they have to.
[02:27:55.387 --> 02:28:08.912]  But there's militia groups that are doing the attacks and that way there's a bit of plausible deniability there for the states that are involved.
[02:28:10.743 --> 02:28:18.517]  Because essentially what Iran has said is that if the genocide, okay, there's an escalation ladder here.
[02:28:19.031 --> 02:28:25.275]  So, if Israel continues to do the bombings in Gaza, which I agree with you, they can never defeat Hamas.
[02:28:25.315 --> 02:28:34.601]  They haven't, I mean, look, two days ago, in the last two days, 60 Israeli soldiers have been killed, three US soldiers have been killed.
[02:28:35.562 --> 02:28:45.228]  But, you know, to compare how many more Israeli soldiers have been killed in comparison, you know, it's quite a significant amount, and that doesn't even include the hundreds and hundreds of injured.
[02:28:45.688 --> 02:28:47.688]  So just in the last two days.
[02:28:47.688 --> 02:28:52.567]   So they're not winning, they're essentially just killing all the civilians, and you've
[02:28:52.567 --> 02:28:56.567]   all I'm sure seen the images of children being pulled out of the rubble.
[02:28:56.567 --> 02:29:01.887]   It's been, the rate of people who have been killed in this war has been more than I've
[02:29:01.887 --> 02:29:06.087]   ever seen in every war I've ever covered, including the Iraq war.
[02:29:06.087 --> 02:29:08.367]  So it's kind of intense.
[02:29:08.367 --> 02:29:13.367]   But the point is that they haven't been able to, in spite of that, get any of the prisoners
[02:29:13.367 --> 02:29:15.367]  of war out of the tunnels.
[02:29:15.383 --> 02:29:23.587]  Now, as far as I understand, and I'm not absolutely sure, there's about a hundred of them, all of which at the moment are Israeli soldiers.
[02:29:24.027 --> 02:29:35.674]   So they're actually active members The only way to get them out is to exchange them for the prisoners that Israel is holding, which also include women and children.
[02:29:36.174 --> 02:29:38.816]  So that is the scenario we're facing.
[02:29:38.836 --> 02:29:46.780]  They're not going to be able to go in the tunnels and free them because those tunnels go deep, deep down and they're booby-trapped and it's pitch dark.
[02:29:47.501 --> 02:29:48.181]  It can't be done.
[02:29:48.561 --> 02:30:04.440]   So unless they want to gas the tunnels and gas the hostages along with them, the prisoners of war, Well, that's actually what I learned about a week after the start of the Delta Force Plan, is to actually put opiate gas in and just make everybody go to sleep.
[02:30:05.341 --> 02:30:14.869]  The problem is, is that the insurgents or Hamas is going to wear a mask, and then the hostages probably aren't going to be.
[02:30:14.909 --> 02:30:15.810]  But yeah, that's what they're doing.
[02:30:15.870 --> 02:30:20.374]  And the studies show, I think like 10% of people hit with that gas will die.
[02:30:21.778 --> 02:30:31.484]  I think I've heard one of them, some of the news coming out that they already tried it and they've already killed three of the prisoners of war there.
[02:30:32.084 --> 02:30:55.238]   So, you know, the prisoners of war, they are soldiers at the moment because all of the civilian, so when the ceasefire ended, the first ceasefire when they were, you know, that was when, as far as I understand, the majority of the civilian hostages were exchanged For the civilians and the children that Israel was also holding and has been holding for years.
[02:30:55.698 --> 02:30:59.901]  So now it's come to now the military thing and that's why negotiations broke down.
[02:30:59.921 --> 02:31:03.143]  Because obviously they're going to ask for more when it comes to the soldiers.
[02:31:03.904 --> 02:31:05.585]  Especially the high-ranking soldiers.
[02:31:05.645 --> 02:31:08.467]  And I want you Syrian girls, you're such an expert, so you'll have the floor.
[02:31:08.487 --> 02:31:10.288]  We don't got a break for like eight minutes, so just...
[02:31:12.417 --> 02:31:28.728]  Get into whatever you want, but also, 35,000 foot view, the threat of nuclear war, if Iran gets hit, they could detonate a nuke, say they didn't do it, the West could do it, say Iran did it, and they've opened the border up to let all these people in, to clearly maybe even set up a false flag or let it happen.
[02:31:29.028 --> 02:31:31.330]  I mean, this is unprecedented times is what I'm saying.
[02:31:31.870 --> 02:31:34.012]  All the pieces are moving very quickly right now.
[02:31:35.410 --> 02:31:38.111]  Well, you know, the people who control the U.S.
[02:31:38.151 --> 02:31:41.131]  government, they obviously don't really care about the U.S.
[02:31:41.171 --> 02:31:41.852]  as a nation.
[02:31:41.932 --> 02:31:45.553]  Otherwise, and I agree with you completely, otherwise they would be protecting their own borders.
[02:31:46.073 --> 02:31:49.494]  Like, they'd be building walls on their own doorstep.
[02:31:49.754 --> 02:31:52.214]  But instead you have, you know, the U.S.
[02:31:52.254 --> 02:31:54.655]  government funding wars at walls.
[02:31:55.735 --> 02:32:31.293]   that surrounded Gaza like it was a giant concentration camp that you couldn't get in or out of for 26 years and actually inside Gaza like 70% of the people are actually refugees from what is now being referred to as Israel and those areas that were those cities like Ashkelon those were all Palestinian only about you know 30 years ago so what's happening now is they're all like why why is the US funding these wars funding these walls in foreign Middle Eastern conflicts, but not on their own borders.
[02:32:31.453 --> 02:32:33.274]  And I think, you know, the agendas are clear.
[02:32:33.454 --> 02:32:34.195]  It's all about money.
[02:32:34.215 --> 02:32:35.256]  It's all about business.
[02:32:35.716 --> 02:32:39.059]  And they want cheap labor coming in from the border.
[02:32:39.459 --> 02:32:45.504]  And so the nuclear aspect of this is very, very, very important.
[02:32:45.665 --> 02:32:46.806]  So I just want to get into that.
[02:32:47.046 --> 02:32:51.830]  The escalation here, you know, I think, it is my belief that we're already in World War Three.
[02:32:52.770 --> 02:32:55.791]  You know, we don't know what World War 3 was supposed to look like.
[02:32:56.151 --> 02:33:04.354]  And I think, you know, when you combine the global conflicts around the world, we're already, like, either here or, like, tittering on the edge.
[02:33:04.895 --> 02:33:12.697]  And if World War 3 is the moment that nuclear bombs are used, then maybe tactical nuclear bombs have already been used.
[02:33:13.038 --> 02:33:35.693]   So, but, however, when it comes to the Samson Option that Israel has stated, You know they have like a hundred or more nukes and their idea is that if their project of having a Jewish state in the Levant begins to appear to fail and they're facing a threat then they're not just going to nuke their enemies.
[02:33:36.598 --> 02:33:38.798]  They're planning to nuke their allies.
[02:33:39.219 --> 02:33:42.739]  So they would nuke the United States, they would nuke the UK, they would nuke France.
[02:33:43.199 --> 02:33:48.161]  Because it's kind of like, if you don't help us, we're taking you down with us.
[02:33:48.701 --> 02:33:51.301]  And we're going to break down all these walls like Samson did.
[02:33:51.761 --> 02:34:00.123]  Now, the escalation ladder, you know, what we have here is sort of non-state actors are the ones fighting.
[02:34:00.163 --> 02:34:03.244]  You have the Houthis, you have Hezbollah, and you have Hamas.
[02:34:04.652 --> 02:34:10.796]  Iran and Syria and Lebanon are not involved yet.
[02:34:12.918 --> 02:34:20.824]  The rules of engagement are, let these guys fight it out, Israel and the militia groups, and the US should not step in.
[02:34:22.625 --> 02:34:24.326]  As a result, the US will not be targeted.
[02:34:24.747 --> 02:34:30.431]  But the US has stepped in by attacking the Houthis in the Red Sea.
[02:34:31.312 --> 02:34:37.218]  And the Red Sea blockade is supposed to stop supply lines from entering Israel.
[02:34:37.619 --> 02:34:40.682]  So the US Navy has no reason to.
[02:34:40.962 --> 02:34:43.484]  Their vessels were getting let in fine.
[02:34:44.345 --> 02:35:02.458]   But as a result of that, that is why you're seeing a vast escalation Let me just interject quickly because I just want to say here, I understand why the Houthis are doing it in solidarity with the Palestinians, but they are the ones firing missiles out in the ocean.
[02:35:02.538 --> 02:35:05.620]  So, you know, to say that the U.S.
[02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:10.082]  is attacking their ships, clearly Iran through their proxies wants a provocation.
[02:35:11.002 --> 02:35:13.523]  Disagree with me if you do, but I think that's prima facie.
[02:35:13.543 --> 02:35:21.905]  I think it's on his face Why does Iran want to escalate this or do you disagree with that because I think clearly they're escalating I think I don't think I know they've got nuclear weapons.
[02:35:22.305 --> 02:35:25.546]  We know they're allied with Russia now We know China's involved.
[02:35:25.626 --> 02:35:27.106]  I mean I said this on October 7th.
[02:35:27.146 --> 02:35:31.841]   I said Hamas is gonna be behind this With Hezbollah funding them.
[02:35:32.741 --> 02:35:37.504]  I said Hezbollah is going to be running this with Hamas as their front, and this is a trap.
[02:35:37.824 --> 02:35:44.288]  So whether you're pro-Israeli or neutral or anti-whatever, I could have told Israel, you're the victims now.
[02:35:45.089 --> 02:35:49.471]  Say you want the leaders of Hamas killed, who don't even live in Gaza.
[02:35:50.112 --> 02:35:56.375]  We know Israel helped found Hamas in the 70s to delegitimize the Palestinian Authority.
[02:35:56.615 --> 02:35:59.097]  So I see some real hanky-panky behind the scenes here.
[02:36:00.014 --> 02:36:04.118]  The reason this happened now is because of the Abraham Accords.
[02:36:04.298 --> 02:36:14.107]  Because Saudi Arabia was going to basically forget about the Palestinians, forget about what's happening to them, sign this peace treaty.
[02:36:15.448 --> 02:36:17.470]  Both Iran and Saudi Arabia joined BRICS.
[02:36:17.951 --> 02:36:21.494]   All of this stuff is part of the calculus Of why this happened.
[02:36:21.814 --> 02:36:25.677]  Now things escalated more than Iran realised it would.
[02:36:26.017 --> 02:36:34.883]  Especially because the IDF has now been proven to have used Apache helicopters to fire randomly on any car, killing a bunch of civilians.
[02:36:35.384 --> 02:36:38.366]  And it got much, much bigger maybe than a lot of people thought it would.
[02:36:38.866 --> 02:36:52.763]  And I think that what's happening in the Red Sea is an attempt, actually, to kind of escalate, to de-escalate, in the sense that, you know, they're trying to stop what's happening in Gaza, because if they don't do anything, then Gaza will be ethnic.
[02:36:52.803 --> 02:36:56.808]  Sure, you're saying, you're saying, hold the shipping lanes hostage so that the West sues for peace.
[02:36:59.022 --> 02:36:59.562]  Exactly.
[02:36:59.682 --> 02:37:00.863]  That's exactly the idea.
[02:37:02.223 --> 02:37:03.343]  But they don't want to do that, right?
[02:37:03.443 --> 02:37:12.606]  So that's why they're... Actually, even though they've attacked these ships, they're firing rockets, nobody has died actually on the boats at all, thankfully.
[02:37:13.066 --> 02:37:18.527]  So it's kind of like, you know, they're trying to minimize escalation as well.
[02:37:18.587 --> 02:37:21.348]  I mean, they could be going much further if they wanted to.
[02:37:21.368 --> 02:37:31.671]   Okay, so then why would Iran have their Hezbollah controlled rebels, Quds Force, send this big powerful drone in and kill U.S.
[02:37:31.691 --> 02:37:34.852]  troops at that base.
[02:37:34.932 --> 02:37:38.054]  Because, I mean, that's asking to get blown up.
[02:37:39.301 --> 02:37:47.626]  Ah, it wasn't Hezbollah, it was some Iraqi group, I think the Islamic Army or something, so I'm not sure.
[02:37:47.666 --> 02:37:50.487]  Sure, but I mean, you're saying Iran's not involved in supplying them with the weapons?
[02:37:51.168 --> 02:38:00.993]  I definitely think that they are, they're actually one of the militias that fought ISIS in Iraq alongside the U.S., and they're supported by Iran, that's for sure.
[02:38:01.713 --> 02:38:06.176]  But the reason why that happened... So you don't think Iran is in control of that group?
[02:38:07.526 --> 02:38:08.066]  No, no, I do.
[02:38:08.187 --> 02:38:09.207]  I agree with you completely.
[02:38:09.347 --> 02:38:10.989]  I think Iran boxed them, I think, 100%.
[02:38:12.190 --> 02:38:19.015]  But I think the reason that they did that is, again, as a kind of a message because, you know, it's kind of like an escalation ladder.
[02:38:19.315 --> 02:38:23.018]  And the escalation ladder is already... No, I know the Rand Corporation escalation ladder.
[02:38:23.038 --> 02:38:23.459]  You're right.
[02:38:23.539 --> 02:38:24.780]  So this leads right to nuclear war.
[02:38:25.896 --> 02:38:26.576]  Exactly.
[02:38:26.857 --> 02:38:28.777]  Which is exactly what we're here to talk about.
[02:38:29.038 --> 02:38:34.100]  Now, if this keeps going, it should be that people say, okay, let's pull out of Syria.
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:35.581]  Why are soldiers there?
[02:38:35.661 --> 02:38:37.982]  They're not there to fight ISIS because ISIS is defeated.
[02:38:38.002 --> 02:38:42.644]  They're there to threaten the Syrian military and try to do a regime change.
[02:38:42.984 --> 02:38:43.765]  Let's just pull them out!
[02:38:44.185 --> 02:38:45.046]  Pull them out of Iraq!
[02:38:45.226 --> 02:38:47.127]  The Iraq war was, you know, a complete flaw.
[02:38:47.468 --> 02:38:50.690]  The other day, the Iraqi parliament asked the US to leave.
[02:38:50.750 --> 02:38:51.411]  Just pull them out!
[02:38:51.631 --> 02:38:52.812]  There's no need for them there.
[02:38:53.152 --> 02:38:54.793]  That would be a de-escalation, right?
[02:38:55.074 --> 02:39:04.381]  But what's happening now is that if we keep escalating, right, eventually the US and Iran will get into a direct fight.
[02:39:04.701 --> 02:39:09.065]  If they get into a direct fight as well, Israel and Syria, Russia will get in there.
[02:39:09.765 --> 02:39:11.927]  China is also around the Red Sea area.
[02:39:13.007 --> 02:39:22.970]  Even if it was just the US and Iran, if either of those states feel like their existence is under threat, Iran is just going to nuke Israel.
[02:39:23.310 --> 02:39:25.350]  And then Israel is going to launch nukes at everybody.
[02:39:25.751 --> 02:39:28.151]  And then everybody is going to launch nukes at everybody.
[02:39:28.491 --> 02:39:30.712]  And what we're going to have here is the end of the world.
[02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:32.080]  Absolutely!
[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:33.641]  So stay right there, Syrian girl.
[02:39:33.661 --> 02:39:40.866]  Let's talk about the different scenarios and how we stop this and how some of the globalist forces may think they can control this, which is sheer madness.
[02:39:40.886 --> 02:39:44.848]  They already released a virus for global control and killed 20 million people with a poison shot.
[02:39:45.149 --> 02:39:49.631]  We are in the throes of total megalomania by the elites of the planet.
[02:39:50.112 --> 02:39:53.754]  And then once the hysteria starts in the governments, it's like World War I or World War II, it's on.
[02:39:54.134 --> 02:39:58.377]  And now we've got nuclear weapons, biological weapons, chemical weapons, and so much more.
[02:39:59.585 --> 02:40:03.969]  The United States has antimatter weapons that can destroy the entire solar system, for those that didn't know.
[02:40:04.329 --> 02:40:07.011]  That's how crazy our establishment is, yeah.
[02:40:07.091 --> 02:40:09.534]  In 1945, they had Obama blow up a Japanese city.
[02:40:09.914 --> 02:40:11.495]  They got stuff that'll blow the sun up.
[02:40:11.936 --> 02:40:12.516]  We'll be right back.
[02:40:12.556 --> 02:40:12.957]  Stay with us.
[02:40:12.977 --> 02:40:14.438]  We've got some good news for everybody.

[02:41:02.095 --> 02:41:04.736]  There's a lot of products available there that are available at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:41:05.056 --> 02:41:06.116]  A lot of products that aren't available.
[02:41:08.776 --> 02:41:16.144]  All right, investigative journalist Syrian Girl is our guest.
[02:41:16.845 --> 02:41:19.528]  We're very honored to have her with us here.
[02:41:20.669 --> 02:41:21.891]  But I'm talking big picture.
[02:41:22.952 --> 02:41:24.554]  This has escalated out of control.
[02:41:25.074 --> 02:41:28.178]  Mitch McConnell, the neocon, said they want to start attacking Iran.
[02:41:30.126 --> 02:41:34.550]  Iran, we know, has all sorts of high-tech weapons supplying Russia right now.
[02:41:35.371 --> 02:41:38.874]  This is unraveling very quickly.
[02:41:38.934 --> 02:41:45.260]  What's the worst-case scenarios in your research view versus the best-case scenarios, and what do you expect to come out of this now?
[02:41:47.987 --> 02:42:02.698]  Well, the worst case scenario is that someone in Washington convinces, you know, the higher-ups that, you know, the AIPAC group, the ADL, gets in there and says the U.S.
[02:42:02.738 --> 02:42:10.004]  needs to fight for Israel in Iran and Iran's not going to use nukes.
[02:42:10.384 --> 02:42:11.825]  Iran's not going to escalate.
[02:42:12.125 --> 02:42:17.149]  They're probably going to just abandon this whole Palestine thing if we push them hard enough.
[02:42:18.061 --> 02:42:34.368]  And that is a miscalculation, because for Iran, if it doesn't have this strategic depth in the region, then it's just going to become isolated and there's just not going to be any Iran anymore, essentially.
[02:42:34.408 --> 02:42:36.909]  So for them, this is like a fight for their existence.
[02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:45.052]  But for the United States, this is technically not really a fight for the United States' existence, because the United States is not really under threat.
[02:42:47.093 --> 02:42:50.276]  The best case scenario would be that the U.S.
[02:42:50.496 --> 02:42:52.177]  makes allies with Syria.
[02:42:52.278 --> 02:42:54.559]  Syria would love to be the United States ally.
[02:42:54.579 --> 02:42:58.563]  The only thing that's stopping that is the U.S.
[02:42:58.603 --> 02:42:59.884]  has chosen Israel.
[02:43:00.364 --> 02:43:08.050]  And, you know, I don't think that it's a correct choice because that is causing a lot of instability in the region.
[02:43:08.551 --> 02:43:10.232]  And the nuclear threat is there.
[02:43:10.672 --> 02:43:12.374]  And of course... No, I totally agree.
[02:43:12.414 --> 02:43:13.615]  So let's talk about Israel.
[02:43:14.195 --> 02:43:15.897]  Because I don't hate Israel, I don't hate anybody.
[02:43:16.397 --> 02:43:30.530]  But the chutzpah here, beyond bravado or hubris, okay they got the Samson option, mutually assured destruction, they get attacked, they get overrun, they say they attack all the Middle Eastern countries basically, well then Israel gets totally destroyed as well.
[02:43:31.430 --> 02:43:33.892]  So you think Israel is crazy enough to do that?
[02:43:34.152 --> 02:43:35.473]  Because that's where this is going.
[02:43:35.734 --> 02:43:36.614]  Most analysts agree.
[02:43:36.634 --> 02:43:39.877]  I mean, the James Baker group agrees, which is a top globalist group.
[02:43:39.897 --> 02:43:40.597]  They say don't do it.
[02:43:41.118 --> 02:43:42.639]  The UN even says don't do it.
[02:43:42.699 --> 02:43:46.742]  I mean, anybody can look at this and say 80% chance this ends in nuclear war.
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:55.929]  Well, the Israelis are, you have to think of them more like a terrorist group, because they think of themselves that way, that's how they started.
[02:43:56.309 --> 02:44:01.655]  So the IDF especially was started as three terrorist groups, Haganah, Ergon and Lahi.
[02:44:01.996 --> 02:44:09.284]   So not only would they be bombing The Middle Eastern countries, they actually have plans to bomb even the United States with a nuclear weapon.
[02:44:09.605 --> 02:44:11.006]  That is the Samson option.
[02:44:12.088 --> 02:44:20.398]  But the best case scenario would be to disarm Israel somehow, maybe through the IAEA, because that is where we're going to end up.
[02:44:20.418 --> 02:44:23.482]  I mean, if Iran gets disarmed, maybe Israel can be disarmed at the same time.
[02:44:23.882 --> 02:44:28.906]  Israel of football, all the Arab states use it to oppress their people, and they argue about Israel all day.
[02:44:28.926 --> 02:44:30.888]  I mean, I kind of see the Abraham Accords as good.
[02:44:31.208 --> 02:44:37.853]  I know you said it sells out the Palestinians, but it got all those countries to work together, and I see all this as a backroom globalist deal to blow that up.
[02:44:39.515 --> 02:44:44.339]  No, I mean, yes, there's definitely something to blow this up, but... Let me ask you this.
[02:44:44.379 --> 02:44:50.984]  What's the change under Trump when they got rid of the old Saudi leadership and put in the new, who is pro-Trump, anti-Biden?
[02:44:51.004 --> 02:44:52.806]  I mean, what's the real political stuff there?
[02:44:53.746 --> 02:44:55.687]  I mean, honestly, MBS is a globalist.
[02:44:55.848 --> 02:45:10.619]  Because if you looked at the Lion Project, I mean, that neon, that 15-minute city, that is all a bunch of occult, like, you know, it's actually what is being built by, like, it's kind of linked to Israel as well.
[02:45:11.700 --> 02:45:17.105]  And it's like this green city and it's like the planned cage with the rest of us to sample.
[02:45:17.545 --> 02:45:21.549]  That whole thing, you know, it's linked to the Abraham Accords.
[02:45:21.909 --> 02:45:29.416]  So I don't see that as necessarily a good thing because essentially it's just like bringing globalism to the Middle East as well.
[02:45:30.537 --> 02:45:33.762]   And MBS is Look, he has some good points.
[02:45:33.842 --> 02:45:42.664]  I mean, he did allow women to drive finally, but at the same time, he took all of his relatives and threw them in prison.
[02:45:42.884 --> 02:45:50.765]  And, you know, he was bombing Yemen for about 10 years as well, until he's like, you know, threw his hat in and had enough.
[02:45:51.165 --> 02:45:56.967]  So, you know, the Abraham Accords are basically like making peace in the Middle East without the Palestinians.
[02:45:57.387 --> 02:45:59.307]  Like, let's make peace with everybody else.
[02:45:59.927 --> 02:46:07.190]  But forget about the fact that there's 4 million Palestinians that have no citizenship and no state and we're treating them as like second-class citizens.
[02:46:07.430 --> 02:46:08.691]  It's just not going to work, you know.
[02:46:08.911 --> 02:46:18.315]  You can't make peace unless you're making peace with the people you are at war with, which includes Syria because, you know, Israel occupies part of Syrian territory.
[02:46:18.695 --> 02:46:21.717]  Well, I think you agree that this has gotten out of control.
[02:46:21.797 --> 02:46:23.058]  It's not gone well for Israel.
[02:46:23.478 --> 02:46:27.641]  It's been the biggest political black eye Israel's had since they got established in 1947.
[02:46:28.502 --> 02:46:30.743]  I mean, this has totally turned the world against Israel.
[02:46:30.804 --> 02:46:33.806]  Any way you can slice it, but Israel's only doubling down.
[02:46:34.586 --> 02:46:36.788]  I just want to say one last thing.
[02:46:37.428 --> 02:46:40.230]  Just that Israel actually gave away a lot of U.S.
[02:46:40.850 --> 02:46:43.031]  military secrets in the 80s.
[02:46:43.852 --> 02:46:53.498]  So that is why I wanted to say that Syria would make a much better ally than Israel because, you know, they have very... Israel's ties to China, they sold all the U.S.
[02:46:54.378 --> 02:46:57.200]  missile technology, airplane technology.
[02:46:57.440 --> 02:46:59.201]  Essentially, we would love to get the U.S.
[02:46:59.221 --> 02:47:03.124]  to get Israel to de-escalate because I don't think it's going to be able to de-escalate on its own.
[02:47:03.797 --> 02:47:05.559]  Well, let's talk about the people of Israel themselves.
[02:47:05.839 --> 02:47:15.708]  I mean, Netanyahu has less than 20% support, but due to parliamentary manipulation, it's just like Trudeau in Canada, he stays in power, how Merkel stayed in power.
[02:47:15.728 --> 02:47:23.955]  I mean, we saw a civil war in Israel before October 7th, and we saw a clear 7-plus hour stand down by the Israeli military.
[02:47:26.263 --> 02:47:28.284]  Yeah, well it was Yom Kippur.
[02:47:29.864 --> 02:47:43.109]  Maybe they had intel that they saw it coming and they let it happen, but we know for sure that by their own account that they actually made it much bigger because they used Apache helicopters in towns on the kibbutz.
[02:47:43.749 --> 02:48:00.883]   You know, hostages that were there said that they were fighting like The IDF was just firing on everything and everyone because of the, not the Dahiyya Doctrine, it's another doctrine where if someone's taken hostage, their policy is to shoot the hostages as well.
[02:48:01.864 --> 02:48:06.008]  So this is one of the Israeli IDF policies.
[02:48:06.529 --> 02:48:09.972]  So that is why it got much, much bigger and maybe that was part of the intention.
[02:48:13.860 --> 02:48:18.982]  Well, the US is now fighting on two fronts.
[02:48:19.002 --> 02:48:19.902]  It's fighting in Ukraine.
[02:48:20.182 --> 02:48:26.245]  The US oil reserves are down to the lowest it ever has.
[02:48:29.386 --> 02:48:39.994]   The oil shortages that are going to happen, the hyperinflation that's going to happen, You know, not just in the U.S., but here in Australia, people are starving to death.
[02:48:40.034 --> 02:48:41.775]  This is not just about nuclear war.
[02:48:41.976 --> 02:48:45.059]  The catastrophe can be much wider and economic.
[02:48:45.099 --> 02:48:46.320]  Oh, it's just like the U.N.
[02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:49.383]  lockdowns for 3 years and the 3rd world killed 27 million people.
[02:48:49.704 --> 02:48:50.545]  Nobody hears about it.
[02:48:50.845 --> 02:48:52.627]  It wasn't the virus that did that, it was the lockdowns.
[02:48:54.383 --> 02:48:57.504]  Well yeah, exactly right, and that was part of the plan.
[02:48:57.544 --> 02:49:07.328]  They wanted to do the Great Reset, they wanted to do vaccine passports, and now the economy is completely under collapse, and it's just going to drive it over the edge.
[02:49:07.348 --> 02:49:19.273]  You know, the Syrian economy is not having a very good time either, because the occupation is on the oil fields as well, but the US isn't getting any of that oil.
[02:49:20.794 --> 02:49:25.999]  Meanwhile, Israel also wants those big oil and gas fields right off the coast there of Gaza.
[02:49:26.619 --> 02:49:29.662]  But again, you have Zuckerberg and all the globalist building bunkers.
[02:49:30.102 --> 02:49:32.785]  How do they think they're going to be safe in bunkers in nuclear war?
[02:49:33.165 --> 02:49:35.107]  Everybody, when they're starving, is going to go to the bunkers.
[02:49:36.848 --> 02:49:40.812]  They think that they're going to bring about the coming of the Messiah, okay?
[02:49:40.952 --> 02:49:45.647]   This is all a big messianic Apocalyptic death cult.
[02:49:46.227 --> 02:49:47.047]  They don't even care.
[02:49:47.347 --> 02:49:48.108]  They have the bunkers.
[02:49:48.168 --> 02:49:52.289]  Sure, the people with the money and all of the influence, they have the bunkers.
[02:49:52.550 --> 02:50:08.856]  But the occultist types that are actually in charge, even ISIS guys, they thought that if they were going to go to war with 60 countries, this is going to make a prophecy happen which is going to bring the return of Jesus Christ to Damascus.
[02:50:09.496 --> 02:50:27.922]  Now, the Messiah isn't Jesus Christ to everyone, just to Muslims and Christians, but essentially this is about trying to get all the... building the third temple, getting the third Haifa, getting the Messiah to come, and we have to do all of these things, including catastrophic wars.
[02:50:28.022 --> 02:50:28.902]  Alright, stay right there.
[02:50:28.922 --> 02:50:29.803]  Stay right there.
[02:50:29.823 --> 02:50:30.943]  We've got a few minutes left with you.
[02:50:32.216 --> 02:50:36.478]  The big exclusive report about the big victory in federal courts that hasn't been announced yet.
[02:50:36.518 --> 02:50:37.579]  This is not broken anywhere.
[02:50:37.759 --> 02:50:38.359]  Overhead shot.
[02:50:38.880 --> 02:50:41.461]  It's now on InfoWars.com.
[02:50:41.861 --> 02:50:43.422]  I put it on X at RealAlexJones.
[02:50:43.462 --> 02:50:46.864]  It's a big exclusive story right now.
[02:50:47.444 --> 02:50:49.865]  Breaking exclusive major Texas border victory.
[02:50:50.205 --> 02:50:54.308]  Federal courts set to rule in favor of Texas against razor wire injunction.
[02:50:55.293 --> 02:50:58.616]  The same federal court that did is about to force a full trial on that.
[02:50:58.976 --> 02:51:00.297]  That'll take months and months and months.
[02:51:00.597 --> 02:51:03.419]  So that story has broken at InfoWars.com.
[02:51:03.759 --> 02:51:07.382]  An exclusive aftersharing girl leaves us in about 5, 6, 7 minutes.
[02:51:08.102 --> 02:51:09.103]  I will get to that.
[02:51:09.143 --> 02:51:18.490]  But I want to play a Nancy Pelosi clip where if we want to cease fire and have all this insanity stop and have the proxy attacks on U.S.
[02:51:18.510 --> 02:51:20.572]  troops stop and stop the attacks on shipping.
[02:51:21.798 --> 02:51:26.841]  It's all Putin, this magical leprechaun who controls the world.
[02:51:26.921 --> 02:51:28.542]  Who believes any of this?
[02:51:29.002 --> 02:51:32.204]  That Putin is running everything.
[02:51:32.544 --> 02:51:35.306]  Did Putin have the Israeli troops stand down?
[02:51:35.906 --> 02:51:39.028]  Did Putin give $6 billion to Iran a month before October 7th?
[02:51:39.468 --> 02:51:39.689]  No.
[02:51:39.749 --> 02:51:41.650]  This is ridiculous and here it is.
[02:51:42.722 --> 02:51:44.603]  They're in front of my house all the time.
[02:51:44.943 --> 02:51:49.384]  So I have a feeling for what feelings they have.
[02:51:49.424 --> 02:51:51.725]  But we have to think about what we're doing.
[02:51:52.085 --> 02:51:56.006]  And what we have to do is try to stop the suffering and gossip.
[02:51:56.326 --> 02:52:00.367]  This is women and children, people who don't have a place to go.
[02:52:00.387 --> 02:52:01.728]  So let's address that.
[02:52:02.648 --> 02:52:07.072]  But for them to call for a ceasefire is Mr. Putin's message.
[02:52:07.973 --> 02:52:09.254]  Mr. Putin's message.
[02:52:09.314 --> 02:52:10.315]  Make no mistake.
[02:52:10.375 --> 02:52:13.758]  This is directly connected to what he would like to see.
[02:52:14.439 --> 02:52:15.880]  Same thing with Ukraine.
[02:52:16.340 --> 02:52:18.142]  It's about Putin's message.
[02:52:18.622 --> 02:52:23.907]  I think some of these some of these protesters are spontaneous and organic and sincere.
[02:52:24.468 --> 02:52:27.130]  Some, I think, are connected to Russia.
[02:52:27.230 --> 02:52:32.112]   And I say that having Looked at this for a long time now, as you know.
[02:52:32.132 --> 02:52:34.153]  You think some of these protests are Russian plants?
[02:52:35.793 --> 02:52:38.394]  I think some financing should be investigated.
[02:52:38.914 --> 02:52:42.776]  And I want to ask the FBI to investigate that.
[02:52:42.976 --> 02:52:44.796]  But a party... Let's stop right there.
[02:52:44.936 --> 02:52:46.597]  We'll go back to the end of it in a second.
[02:52:46.837 --> 02:52:47.617]  Back it up ten seconds.
[02:52:48.898 --> 02:52:51.379]  They gave six billion dollars to Iran a month before this happened.
[02:52:51.479 --> 02:52:51.919]  Our government.
[02:52:53.226 --> 02:52:54.067]  Now it's Putin.
[02:52:54.247 --> 02:52:58.449]  I mean, she just said, oh, we need to take care of the women and children, but we don't want to cease fire.
[02:52:58.509 --> 02:52:59.690]  The double think here.
[02:52:59.710 --> 02:53:02.511]  I know Syrian girls chomping at the bit, but let's let's finish with Pelosi.
[02:53:02.531 --> 02:53:02.912]  Here it is.
[02:53:03.732 --> 02:53:06.814]  Let's just say it's all spontaneous and sincere.
[02:53:08.154 --> 02:53:10.096]  I say it's all spontaneous and sincere.
[02:53:10.636 --> 02:53:13.457]  Young people care about the right to choose.
[02:53:13.638 --> 02:53:15.539]  They care about LGBTQ issues.
[02:53:15.559 --> 02:53:17.960]  They care about preserving the planet.
[02:53:18.260 --> 02:53:19.681]  They care about gun violence.
[02:53:20.234 --> 02:53:24.794]   prevention, that's what they tell us. They care about our democracy and the
[02:53:24.794 --> 02:53:28.934]   freedoms that are contained in some of what I said. So they're going to have to
[02:53:28.934 --> 02:53:37.354]   make a decision, staying home to enable or to agonize, organize, not agonize but
[02:53:37.354 --> 02:53:41.273]   organize and get out there and get the job done. I have every confidence that Joe
[02:53:41.273 --> 02:53:46.874]   Biden and Kamala Harris will be President and Vice President of the United States.
[02:53:46.874 --> 02:53:50.800]   What do you make of that incoherent And then I'm gonna give you five minutes to finish.
[02:53:50.840 --> 02:53:51.500]  Any other points?
[02:53:51.541 --> 02:53:52.181]  Any other keys?
[02:53:52.241 --> 02:53:54.124]  And how do you think we de-escalate this?
[02:53:54.144 --> 02:53:55.045]  Or what do you think, Sharon Girl?
[02:53:57.260 --> 02:54:05.022]  It makes no sense at all because Russia's happy to have the US involved in the Middle East because it's lightening their load in Ukraine.
[02:54:05.102 --> 02:54:06.362]  Why would they want to stop it?
[02:54:07.243 --> 02:54:08.943]  It's illogical completely.
[02:54:09.223 --> 02:54:24.607]  And of course this is the same woman that said to AIPAC that, and I quote verbatim, if this whole capital crumbles to the ground, the only thing that would remain is our commitment to Israel.
[02:54:25.467 --> 02:54:27.108]  So that's Nancy Pelosi.
[02:54:27.128 --> 02:54:30.349]  So obviously she has her agendas, she has her backers, she has her funders.
[02:54:31.069 --> 02:54:43.433]  You know, all of this liberalism, this fake humanitarian, like, we care about people's rights, all goes out the window when you have 10,000 kids that are being pulled out, dismembered under the rubble.
[02:54:43.793 --> 02:54:48.135]  That's perfectly okay, because they're not, you know, they're just, they're just Palestinian.
[02:54:48.535 --> 02:54:51.056]  They bombed churches in Gaza.
[02:54:51.336 --> 02:54:52.176]  They bombed hospitals.
[02:54:52.456 --> 02:54:53.036]  Doesn't matter.
[02:54:53.336 --> 02:54:54.797]  You know, it's all, it's just Russia.
[02:54:55.137 --> 02:54:55.778]  Russia's doing it.
[02:54:56.038 --> 02:54:57.560]  This woman is completely insane.
[02:54:58.040 --> 02:55:00.743]  I don't know how much longer we have to suffer her.
[02:55:01.564 --> 02:55:05.428]  I just wanted to finish off while I have a few more minutes.
[02:55:05.909 --> 02:55:07.951]  I wanted to thank you, Alex, for letting me speak.
[02:55:08.011 --> 02:55:12.917]  I wanted to say that the occultists that I discussed earlier, please look into it.
[02:55:13.357 --> 02:55:15.218]  It's not a crazy conspiracy theory.
[02:55:15.238 --> 02:55:18.479]  It just so happens that the people in charge are crazy.
[02:55:19.700 --> 02:55:26.122]  They want to bring about the apocalypse because they want war, plague, COVID was the plague, starvation and death.
[02:55:26.842 --> 02:55:29.803]  We've seen so many of these wars since 2011.
[02:55:30.204 --> 02:55:33.345]  Obama's Arab Spring, his funding of ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[02:55:33.665 --> 02:55:36.066]  We saw the pandemic.
[02:55:36.426 --> 02:55:38.267]  We saw the wars in the Middle East.
[02:55:38.687 --> 02:55:41.708]  If they go nuclear, that is going to be catastrophic.
[02:55:41.988 --> 02:55:51.999]  But also, even if now, like, Aramco oil fields get bombed as part of the escalation ladder, you know, the shipping gets stopped as well.
[02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:55.083]  There's going to be mass starvation worldwide.
[02:55:55.683 --> 02:55:58.026]  They're banning fertilizers so we can't have food.
[02:55:58.526 --> 02:56:02.827]  And, you know, they're making us eat the insects for some reason.
[02:56:03.728 --> 02:56:10.570]  And, you know, they want to get as close to depopulation, killing millions of people as much as possible.
[02:56:11.070 --> 02:56:13.390]  And that is what we're facing here.
[02:56:13.750 --> 02:56:15.551]  Of course, ceasefire would be ideal.
[02:56:16.151 --> 02:56:21.113]  Unfortunately, I don't think the United States people are running the show anymore.
[02:56:21.533 --> 02:56:26.014]  I think that it's been taken over by foreigners with their own agendas.
[02:56:26.754 --> 02:56:28.717]  And those foreigners are certainly not Russia.
[02:56:29.638 --> 02:56:39.048]  And, you know, unfortunately, I don't know what we're going to do about it because, honestly, we only have our voices.
[02:56:39.148 --> 02:56:40.209]  We have your show, Alex.
[02:56:40.490 --> 02:56:42.172]  You've warned us about this all along.
[02:56:42.752 --> 02:56:55.885]   And I just don't know what the solution is except to keep Spreading the truth, spreading the message, and maybe eventually getting people in there into power that are actually after the US interests.
[02:56:56.045 --> 02:56:59.426]  Yeah, that doesn't want nuclear war.
[02:56:59.506 --> 02:57:00.727]  What's your view of Trump overall?
[02:57:04.388 --> 02:57:04.888]  You know what?
[02:57:05.128 --> 02:57:06.629]  Trump is a wild card.
[02:57:06.989 --> 02:57:09.590]  You know, he says a lot of fantastic things.
[02:57:09.950 --> 02:57:21.252]   He says things like the US is Essentially, in the Middle East, for Israel, he says that we want peace in the Middle East.
[02:57:21.332 --> 02:57:38.189]   I think he was misinformed about, for example, MBS, who has ties with Epstein, who, for example, when he killed Soleimani, when he bombed Syria during the That fake chemical attack.
[02:57:38.690 --> 02:57:43.731]  Those things where he gets a lot of, unfortunately, people around him that maybe give him bad advice.
[02:57:43.751 --> 02:57:46.772]  No, I don't think he means well, but he certainly got more informed now.
[02:57:47.152 --> 02:57:49.412]  In closing, I want to show TV viewers a globe of the planet.
[02:57:50.072 --> 02:57:55.514]  And I'm glad that the camera... He's better than Biden and Clinton and all those guys.
[02:57:55.634 --> 02:57:56.114]  Absolutely.
[02:57:56.454 --> 02:57:58.535]  I want to show a little bit wider shot, guys.
[02:57:58.555 --> 02:58:00.375]  I want to show the globe from the top because that's important.
[02:58:01.515 --> 02:58:03.096]  A main nuclear war is going to happen.
[02:58:04.707 --> 02:58:09.628]  With ICBMs fired out of Russia and the United States, they're only about 10 minutes away from each other.
[02:58:10.048 --> 02:58:11.528]  See how close we are right here.
[02:58:11.948 --> 02:58:26.751]  But also, submarines in the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Gulf of Mexico, and yeah, the United States has submarines in the Mediterranean, and submarines, obviously, in the Pacific, and submarines in the Arctic areas, particularly in the summer.
[02:58:27.471 --> 02:58:32.492]  So, yeah, we can blow Russia up in five minutes, they can kill us in five minutes with submarine-launched missiles.
[02:58:33.632 --> 02:58:35.132]  That's how small this world is.
[02:58:35.212 --> 02:58:41.954]  But if there is a nuclear exchange in the Middle East, it will quickly move to India and Pakistan that are already chomping at the bit.
[02:58:42.494 --> 02:58:53.137]  And of course, with China and this thing, in a matter of 30 minutes, you will see full commitment of nuclear weapons all over the world and the end of life on the surface for a long time in a new dark age, bare minimum.
[02:58:53.798 --> 02:59:00.447]   That's why I'm pushing to not have humanity, you know, become a Graveyard.
[02:59:01.127 --> 02:59:03.288]  This is not our goal right here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:59:03.668 --> 02:59:05.729]  This is not what we're looking for.
[02:59:05.829 --> 02:59:08.310]  Not a planet of death, but a planet of life.
[02:59:08.890 --> 02:59:13.752]  And there's been a lot of hype, a lot of hysteria before, and a lot of, you know, fear over nuclear war.
[02:59:14.132 --> 02:59:19.914]  We're closer, according to the International Atomic Scientists Group, and I agree with them, to midnight, to nuclear war we've ever been.
[02:59:20.194 --> 02:59:25.259]   We need to remove death Out of the equation and stop this insanity now.
[02:59:25.339 --> 02:59:28.122]  But the old political system is coming to an end.
[02:59:28.142 --> 02:59:30.786]  The old financial system is coming to an end.
[02:59:31.126 --> 02:59:37.054]  And they want to put the planet into a crisis so they can pose as saviors yet again.
[02:59:37.474 --> 02:59:38.315]  And that's where we are.
[02:59:38.596 --> 02:59:40.238]  Closing comments, Syrian Girl.
[02:59:41.872 --> 02:59:42.372]  Thank you.
[02:59:42.392 --> 02:59:46.754]  Let's all pray for peace between our nations.
[02:59:46.814 --> 02:59:52.436]  The whole idea that war is good for the economy is absolutely false.
[02:59:53.016 --> 02:59:54.917]  It's good for a few select people.
[02:59:54.937 --> 02:59:57.818]  Oh, the French defense minister said that two weeks ago.
[02:59:57.858 --> 02:59:58.958]  The Swedish minister.
[02:59:59.458 --> 03:00:00.919]  They're like, oh, we're going to have this endless war.
[03:00:00.939 --> 03:00:01.739]  It'll be so good.
[03:00:03.537 --> 03:00:04.138]  It's insane.
[03:00:04.358 --> 03:00:07.321]  Maybe it's good for, like, two people who are selling the guns.
[03:00:07.341 --> 03:00:08.803]  It's not good for the rest of us.
[03:00:08.823 --> 03:00:10.544]  The economy's in shambles.
[03:00:10.865 --> 03:00:19.834]  I say find the nuclear bunkers that these guys are staying in and make sure to note their address so when anything starts, we go right there.
[03:00:19.874 --> 03:00:20.795]  We try to get into them.
[03:00:20.935 --> 03:00:23.097]  All right, Syrian girl, how do people find you?
[03:00:23.117 --> 03:00:23.838]  Where's the best place?
[03:00:25.168 --> 03:00:25.928]  Thank you so much.
[03:00:26.208 --> 03:00:28.349]  Go to Partisan Girl on Twitter.
[03:00:28.389 --> 03:00:29.429]  That's where I'm biggest.
[03:00:29.630 --> 03:00:32.290]  And we have Syrian Girl Partisan on YouTube.
[03:00:33.071 --> 03:00:36.812]  And Syrian Girl Partisan on Telegram as well.
[03:00:37.232 --> 03:00:41.053]  I have a Facebook, but Zuckerberg, I'm sick of him.
[03:00:41.153 --> 03:00:42.214]  Don't want to use it anymore.
[03:00:42.414 --> 03:00:44.935]  Well, if you ever come to the US, we'd love to have you in the studio.
[03:00:47.543 --> 03:00:48.303]  Thank you so much.
[03:00:48.423 --> 03:00:49.864]  I would be honored to meet you.
[03:00:49.904 --> 03:00:51.024]  I hope that happens one day.
[03:00:51.384 --> 03:00:52.385]  Maybe I'll come to Australia.
[03:00:52.485 --> 03:00:52.705]  All right.
[03:00:52.925 --> 03:00:53.385]  Be safe.
[03:00:53.545 --> 03:00:53.885]  Please.
[03:00:54.485 --> 03:00:55.386]  My house is your house.
[03:00:55.526 --> 03:00:56.606]  They may ban me there though.
[03:00:56.646 --> 03:00:57.506]  They ban most people.
[03:00:57.586 --> 03:00:57.807]  All right.
[03:00:57.827 --> 03:00:58.167]  Thank you.
[03:00:58.687 --> 03:01:00.888]  Actually, I'm not sure if I can get into the U.S.
[03:01:00.968 --> 03:01:02.508]  either, so we'll see about that.
[03:01:02.608 --> 03:01:03.729]  All right, Seren Girl.
[03:01:03.769 --> 03:01:04.349]  Thank you so much.
[03:01:04.369 --> 03:01:05.669]  All right.
[03:01:05.729 --> 03:01:06.289]  Thanks a lot.
[03:01:06.990 --> 03:01:07.190]  All right.
[03:01:07.390 --> 03:01:08.090]  All right.
[03:01:08.150 --> 03:01:09.591]  Look, that's a huge subject.
[03:01:09.691 --> 03:01:10.271]  It's massive.
[03:01:11.231 --> 03:01:16.033]  We have an exclusive, and we're going to be talking about it right now.
[03:01:17.440 --> 03:01:26.926]  But everybody got really upset about the injunction and how Texas got blocked and how they started trying to remove razor wire.
[03:01:27.607 --> 03:01:28.668]  And now all these states joined us.
[03:01:28.728 --> 03:01:38.054]  But a federal court, the Fifth Circuit, is set to say, we're going to ignore the injunction and basically allow a trial on merits by Texas.
[03:01:38.074 --> 03:01:40.335]  That'll take weeks or months, probably months.
[03:01:40.535 --> 03:01:44.078]  And the exclusive article is on InfoWars.com right now.
[03:01:45.185 --> 03:01:45.585]  Here it is.
[03:01:45.645 --> 03:01:46.446]  Breaking exclusive.
[03:01:47.007 --> 03:01:48.588]  Major Texas border victory.
[03:01:48.648 --> 03:01:53.512]  Federal court set to rule in favor of Texas against razor wire injunction.
[03:01:54.072 --> 03:01:54.833]  The full article.
[03:01:54.913 --> 03:01:55.554]  Exclusive.
[03:01:55.614 --> 03:01:57.055]  Just now breaking the last 10 minutes.
[03:01:57.615 --> 03:02:00.338]  Infowars.com and RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[03:02:00.818 --> 03:02:02.379]  Get it and share it.
[03:02:03.060 --> 03:02:05.522]  And I'm going to come back next hour for 10-15 minutes.
[03:02:05.542 --> 03:02:06.783]  Gerald understands I do that sometimes.
[03:02:07.103 --> 03:02:07.984]  Then Gerald takes over.
[03:02:08.004 --> 03:02:10.046]  And I'm going to read this article.
[03:02:10.546 --> 03:02:12.288]  A lot of it sent from our federal whistleblowers.
[03:02:12.528 --> 03:02:13.028]  One public.
[03:02:12.867 --> 03:02:14.026]  Some of them not.
[03:02:14.026 --> 03:02:17.506]   We don't just trust our whistleblowers, they're great people, but we also talk to folks
[03:02:17.506 --> 03:02:19.666]  in the courts, they said, yeah, this is dead on.
[03:02:19.666 --> 03:02:23.247]  So this is a breaking news right now.
[03:02:23.247 --> 03:02:24.607]  But let me stop right here.
[03:02:24.607 --> 03:02:29.386]  I can't do this show and change the world without you.
[03:02:29.399 --> 03:02:31.279]  You've changed the world with what you've done.
[03:02:31.319 --> 03:02:33.920]  We've had such incredible victories.
[03:02:34.620 --> 03:02:35.960]  Are you spreading the word about the show?
[03:02:36.160 --> 03:02:37.081]  Are you sharing clips?
[03:02:37.661 --> 03:02:38.781]  Are you praying for the broadcast?
[03:02:38.941 --> 03:02:40.201]  I'm asking humbly for that.
[03:02:40.821 --> 03:02:42.942]  Are you buying products at infowarestore.com?
[03:02:44.878 --> 03:02:52.404]  Less than 1% of our audience, and I'm not complaining, it's just, it's sad, ever goes to InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:02:52.825 --> 03:03:03.133]  We have the best water filtration, the best storable foods, amazing t-shirts, great books, great films, the best supplements that will game change your life at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:03:04.274 --> 03:03:06.276]  Go get the products today.
[03:03:06.516 --> 03:03:08.337]  We're ending the sale in the next 48 hours.
[03:03:08.878 --> 03:03:13.542]  The Supercharged Special, Real Red Pill, DNA Force Plus, 50% off, because they're selling out.
[03:03:14.838 --> 03:03:16.559]  We've got next-level foundational energy.
[03:03:16.759 --> 03:03:19.221]  I knew it'd be a hit product because methylfolate is so popular.
[03:03:19.241 --> 03:03:21.883]  It's the breakdown of folic acid that most people can't break down fully.
[03:03:22.263 --> 03:03:23.624]  Your cells literally eat this.
[03:03:23.985 --> 03:03:25.806]  It's beyond stimulant.
[03:03:26.527 --> 03:03:32.091]  You've never felt energy like this, particularly if you're Northern European, but even black folks feel it.
[03:03:32.771 --> 03:03:39.436]  Most black folks don't have the cellular problem of not being able to process folic acid and methylfolate looking up, but you still feel it.
[03:03:39.776 --> 03:03:51.804]   But if your ass is white like me, This is, this is amazing and athletes take it, people in the Olympics, it's how white folks are winning the marathons and you know the sprints now because they're on methylfolate.
[03:03:52.604 --> 03:03:54.586]  I mean it is, it is amazing.
[03:03:55.606 --> 03:03:58.728]  So, I call it the white person pill but it's good for everybody.
[03:03:59.589 --> 03:04:02.130]  Infowarstore.com, next level financial energy.
[03:04:02.430 --> 03:04:05.933]  It's about to sell out despite that it's discounted still.
[03:04:07.134 --> 03:04:09.496]  I'm in a bankruptcy, so we got a limited run of this, man.
[03:04:09.516 --> 03:04:11.137]  We're trying to get the money to get a big run of this.
[03:04:11.217 --> 03:04:11.937]  I knew it'd be ahead.
[03:04:12.298 --> 03:04:13.198]  It's about to sell out.
[03:04:13.278 --> 03:04:14.379]  Next level of financial energy.

[03:05:36.092 --> 03:05:36.853]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:37.333 --> 03:05:38.074]  Media matters.
[03:05:38.534 --> 03:05:39.495]  The Democratic Party.
[03:05:40.516 --> 03:05:46.804]  MSNBC and others have asked me to apologize for making a parody video game criticizing the deep state and all the corruption.
[03:05:47.445 --> 03:05:49.307]  And to all them, I just want to say this.
[03:05:50.188 --> 03:05:51.370]  Go f*** yourselves!
[03:05:53.132 --> 03:05:59.416]  Alex Jones' New World Order Wars has been number one on Steam thanks to the viewers and listeners of this broadcast.
[03:05:59.776 --> 03:06:12.984]  And I want to invite everyone, before they are successful at banning, which I hope they aren't, to go to alexjonesgame.com and follow the link to Steam and download this game for $17.76 as a message to the New World Order.
[03:06:13.744 --> 03:06:14.164]  F*** you!
[03:06:14.705 --> 03:06:22.708]  You want to try to ban this game just like you want to steal elections and force injections on us and open up our borders and rape us.
[03:06:23.128 --> 03:06:27.110]  This is a culture war and they're scared of this game.
[03:06:27.510 --> 03:06:36.254]  Get Alex Jones New World Order Wars right now at AlexJonesGame.com because anything badass gets censored!
[03:06:37.174 --> 03:06:38.875]  All right, Gerald Celente is set to take over.
[03:06:39.755 --> 03:06:43.937]  I've just decided I'm going to go shoot a special report in the other studio right when the show ends.
[03:06:44.537 --> 03:06:46.438]  I'm going to post it to Infowars.com.
[03:06:47.579 --> 03:06:51.321]  I'm going to post it to X. So, 30 minutes from now, it'll be up.
[03:06:51.361 --> 03:06:52.641]  A quick, hard-hitting report.
[03:06:53.001 --> 03:06:54.122]  I'm going to read this on air.
[03:06:55.943 --> 03:06:57.043]  Breaking exclusive.
[03:06:58.184 --> 03:06:59.764]  Major Texas border victory.
[03:06:59.825 --> 03:07:03.746]  Federal court set to rule in favor of Texas against razor wire injunction.
[03:07:03.766 --> 03:07:04.887]  This is an exclusive.
[03:07:06.656 --> 03:07:12.881]  And we've got reporters about to get in the RV with the crew and go to the border today.
[03:07:13.481 --> 03:07:18.925]  So Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, we'll have crew down there to document what's really going on.
[03:07:18.965 --> 03:07:20.246]  Is this all a farce by the governor?
[03:07:20.646 --> 03:07:22.147]  Is he putting on a show or is it real?
[03:07:22.167 --> 03:07:24.169]  A lot of questions.
[03:07:24.189 --> 03:07:25.470]  We'll be giving you answers.
[03:07:26.230 --> 03:07:31.114]  And then Drew Hernandez Saturday relieves the crew and then Owen and myself right after that.
[03:07:31.234 --> 03:07:32.495]  So we are ready.
[03:07:33.536 --> 03:07:34.877]  And we are over the target.
[03:07:35.237 --> 03:07:37.799]  And we're only here because of you.
[03:07:39.221 --> 03:07:42.283]  And we've got a lot of great whistleblowers and a lot of amazing people.
[03:07:42.323 --> 03:07:43.004]  I'll leave it at that.
[03:07:43.424 --> 03:07:45.846]  You're going to see a lot of huge news.
[03:07:46.266 --> 03:07:55.453]  Breaking and InfoWars.com and Band.Video and of course at Real Alex Jones on X. And by the grace of God where we're still at for now.
[03:07:56.294 --> 03:07:58.836]  So this article is on X. Real Alex Jones.
[03:07:59.216 --> 03:08:00.758]  Go share it right now.
[03:08:04.099 --> 03:08:09.163]  And a video report on it is going to be coming out very, very quickly.
[03:08:09.203 --> 03:08:13.726]  But we cannot do this without you.
[03:08:13.746 --> 03:08:14.727]  So I'll say it again.
[03:08:15.688 --> 03:08:16.588]  Please support us.

[03:08:20.444 --> 03:08:23.466]  And the courts have ruled, more bankruptcies going through, that I have to pay out the legal bills.
[03:08:23.566 --> 03:08:24.206]  I'm upside down.
[03:08:24.727 --> 03:08:27.368]  Go to DefendJones.com on GiveSendGo.
[03:08:27.428 --> 03:08:29.810]  DefendJones.com and make a donation.

[03:08:42.461 --> 03:08:43.522]  I get like 50 cents a book.
[03:08:43.842 --> 03:08:44.082]  Great.
[03:08:44.122 --> 03:08:45.103]  I'll get a check sometime.
[03:08:45.303 --> 03:08:45.843]  It'll be great.
[03:08:46.184 --> 03:08:50.327]  But the Achilles heel, and they knew this, was making me pay half the legal bills in this place.
[03:08:50.928 --> 03:08:53.770]  And free speech has enough money to operate right now, not to really expand.
[03:08:54.330 --> 03:08:56.572]  So support free speech by productsinforce.com.
[03:08:56.932 --> 03:08:58.554]  But it's the book, The Great Awakening.
[03:08:59.574 --> 03:09:07.814]   that funds what I'm doing. Get The Great Awakening. Sign or unsign now. Infowarstore.com. And I thank you all for your
[03:09:07.814 --> 03:09:08.214]  support.
[03:09:08.214 --> 03:09:13.654]   All right. We're going to go to break. And in the next 55 minutes, Gerald Cilente, the top trends forecaster, will
[03:09:13.654 --> 03:09:14.214]  take over.
[03:09:14.214 --> 03:09:19.894]  And then the hard-hitting, informative Owen Schroer, 3 p.m.
[03:09:19.894 --> 03:09:27.187]   to today and 56 minutes from now, takes over for three hours live, uncensored with guest analysis.
[03:09:27.227 --> 03:09:30.290]  Your calls with The War Room and weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[03:09:30.330 --> 03:09:33.975]  Central, with the mighty Harrison Smith and the American Journal.
[03:09:35.327 --> 03:09:36.868]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:36.688 --> 03:09:39.968]   the next 30 minutes. I'm going to shoot a quick report right now and post it. It'll also be on
[03:09:39.968 --> 03:09:45.888]   X. Get it out there because big stuff happening in federal courts, big exclusive, breaking exclusive
[03:09:45.888 --> 03:09:51.968]   major Texas border victory. Federal courts set to rule in favor of Texas against razor wire injunction.
[03:09:51.968 --> 03:09:59.007]   Gerald Salente reports live from Kingston, New York in T-minus 60 seconds. Stay with us and
[03:09:59.007 --> 03:10:03.406]   share those links. That's how we win. Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show.
[03:10:04.288 --> 03:10:09.247]   What Alex was saying, all the crap that are going through with these lawsuits in place.
[03:10:09.461 --> 03:10:13.042]  And again, they're destroying free speech.
[03:10:13.522 --> 03:10:14.862]  It's right in front of our eyes.
[03:10:16.063 --> 03:10:20.204]  And there's no more journalism left.
[03:10:20.404 --> 03:10:21.424]  It's totally gone.
[03:10:21.444 --> 03:10:24.985]  Yeah, you know some of the stories that came out just last week.
[03:10:25.745 --> 03:10:26.425]  Leading U.S.
[03:10:26.485 --> 03:10:28.485]  newspaper announces major layoffs.
[03:10:29.486 --> 03:10:35.504]   The Los Angeles Times announced That they would lay off at least 155 employees or a fifth of its newsroom staff.
[03:10:35.664 --> 03:10:37.145]  Media industry cuts top 20,000.
[03:10:37.185 --> 03:10:37.366]  20,000 in 2023.
[03:10:37.245 --> 03:11:01.284]   newsroom staff. My point, media industry cuts top 20,000 in 2023. There is no media. The
[03:11:01.284 --> 03:11:02.645]  The big zone, everything.
[03:11:02.645 --> 03:11:12.644]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:11:03.762 --> 03:11:08.786]  You got six corporations that own over 90% of the media.
[03:11:09.407 --> 03:11:17.794]  And all they do is repeat the crap that the government tells them to do.
[03:11:19.635 --> 03:11:23.699]  And their corporate bosses, because they're prostitutes.
[03:11:24.588 --> 03:11:31.832]  They're media whores that get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and their government warmasters.
[03:11:32.633 --> 03:11:34.014]  There is no news.
[03:11:34.214 --> 03:11:34.874]  It's gone.
[03:11:35.494 --> 03:11:35.675]  Oh!
[03:11:36.595 --> 03:11:39.337]  A Taylor Swift is everywhere!
[03:11:39.357 --> 03:11:43.279]  Oh, I'm so... Oh, look at her kissing that guy!
[03:11:43.539 --> 03:11:44.840]  Who gives a damn?
[03:11:46.301 --> 03:11:48.362]  Be a good American, Solenti!
[03:11:49.083 --> 03:11:50.303]  Suck up crap!
[03:11:51.064 --> 03:11:52.965]  Be a crap sucker!
[03:11:54.045 --> 03:11:56.187]  What the hell do I care about this crap?
[03:11:56.467 --> 03:11:58.749]  The world is blowing up in front of us.
[03:11:59.989 --> 03:12:01.871]  We're losing all our rights.
[03:12:03.272 --> 03:12:05.554]  The bigs own everything.
[03:12:05.994 --> 03:12:08.756]  Oh, not my, not my line.
[03:12:08.776 --> 03:12:11.218]  How about from Oxfam?
[03:12:11.278 --> 03:12:11.218]  1%.
[03:12:11.097 --> 03:12:25.097]   1%, 1% own 43% of all the global financial assets assets.
[03:12:25.709 --> 03:12:26.309]  That's right.
[03:12:28.810 --> 03:12:29.930]  Private equity groups.
[03:12:30.790 --> 03:12:31.510]  Hedge funds.
[03:12:32.370 --> 03:12:33.731]  Venture capitalists.
[03:12:34.111 --> 03:12:35.891]  Venture slimeballs.
[03:12:37.791 --> 03:12:38.732]  Hedge funds.
[03:12:40.512 --> 03:12:41.832]  A gang.
[03:12:41.912 --> 03:12:43.673]  A crime syndicate.
[03:12:44.013 --> 03:12:45.473]  Got it, girls and boys?
[03:12:48.167 --> 03:12:52.230]  All we become are plantation workers on Slavelandia.
[03:12:53.511 --> 03:12:54.511]  Taylor Swift.
[03:12:56.953 --> 03:13:00.155]  When they go to bed, do they take the football and put it between them?
[03:13:02.096 --> 03:13:04.098]  What the hell do I care about this crap?
[03:13:07.420 --> 03:13:10.642]  So, going back to why you need to support Infowars.
[03:13:11.843 --> 03:13:18.743]   Because, The truth is gone.
[03:13:20.604 --> 03:13:24.065]  It's only crap that they sell.
[03:13:25.865 --> 03:13:28.726]  By the way, these big hedge funds, they're the ones they own.
[03:13:28.786 --> 03:13:31.867]  Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, this cola, that cola.
[03:13:33.007 --> 03:13:33.247]  Yeah.
[03:13:34.627 --> 03:13:36.168]  The big hedge funds own everything.
[03:13:37.148 --> 03:13:37.688]  They're not separate.
[03:13:38.128 --> 03:13:40.269]  Separate corporations hardly exist anymore.
[03:13:42.029 --> 03:13:46.882]   One of my dear Jewish friends, Eldad Benary, I grew up in Israel.
[03:13:47.302 --> 03:13:50.284]  Totally opposed, my friends, to what's going on over there.
[03:13:51.025 --> 03:13:51.685]  Totally opposed.
[03:13:52.105 --> 03:14:02.892]  He sends out this thing that McDonald's is feeding some 4,000 troops a day or something like that while the Palestinians are starving.
[03:14:02.952 --> 03:14:04.113]  How come they're not doing anything?
[03:14:04.133 --> 03:14:05.314]  I wrote back to him.
[03:14:05.714 --> 03:14:07.455]  I said, let them keep feeding them, man.
[03:14:07.475 --> 03:14:10.577]  They'll all blimp out and they won't be able to fight.
[03:14:10.937 --> 03:14:12.018]  Eating McDonald's?
[03:14:15.322 --> 03:14:16.863]  I just got back from Florida.
[03:14:16.923 --> 03:14:20.225]  I went just for a couple of days for memorial service.
[03:14:20.305 --> 03:14:22.566]  A dear friend of mine had passed on me.
[03:14:22.666 --> 03:14:23.606]  So rest in peace.
[03:14:25.988 --> 03:14:29.970]  And I look at what happened, you know, again, what the people look like.
[03:14:30.950 --> 03:14:33.492]  You know, there's this saying, pigs can't fly.
[03:14:33.512 --> 03:14:36.513]  You been to the airport lately?
[03:14:39.695 --> 03:14:41.596]  What a disgrace this country's coming.
[03:14:43.151 --> 03:14:45.873]  Look how low it's falling in front of Alex Jones.
[03:14:47.114 --> 03:14:48.876]  That's why you need to support Infowars.
[03:14:49.276 --> 03:14:55.861]  They're doing everything they can to give you what you're not getting anywhere else.
[03:14:56.822 --> 03:15:03.047]  Again, of course, we put out the Trends Journal magazine and we give you trend forecast analysis that you're not going to find anywhere.
[03:15:03.067 --> 03:15:05.188]  I'm not talking about that.
[03:15:05.208 --> 03:15:09.552]  I'm talking about what they're doing and why it's important to support them.
[03:15:09.612 --> 03:15:10.793]  They have this article up here.
[03:15:13.280 --> 03:15:13.840]  Rhinos.
[03:15:13.880 --> 03:15:15.241]  Republicans in name only.
[03:15:15.421 --> 03:15:16.161]  We're rhinos.
[03:15:16.201 --> 03:15:18.362]  Maybe Lindsey Graham.
[03:15:18.562 --> 03:15:19.762]  Oh, how about Chris Christie?
[03:15:19.962 --> 03:15:21.763]  You wanna see a rhino?
[03:15:22.223 --> 03:15:25.644]  Look at that slobby fat-mouthed pig!
[03:15:27.104 --> 03:15:29.905]  Hey, they got seats big enough for you in the airplane?
[03:15:30.826 --> 03:15:35.607]  This is the little jerk that went off over there to Ukraine how many times?
[03:15:36.067 --> 03:15:37.908]  As he's running for president.
[03:15:38.708 --> 03:15:40.869]  Running for a slob show!
[03:15:41.641 --> 03:15:45.904]  The Ringling Brothers and Bonham and Bailey Circus went out of business!
[03:15:46.685 --> 03:15:51.168]  You don't have to step right up, step right up, and see the fat man!
[03:15:51.568 --> 03:15:53.869]  Just take a look at Chris Christie!
[03:15:55.370 --> 03:15:56.671]  Hey, the tattooed lady?
[03:15:56.771 --> 03:15:58.453]  Oh, they're everywhere!
[03:15:58.473 --> 03:16:03.456]  This country's gone down in front of my eyes, it breaks my heart.
[03:16:04.016 --> 03:16:09.200]  So, going back to the articles, again, we cover the world in the Trends Journal.
[03:16:09.784 --> 03:16:11.986]  So, for example, what's going on in Israel.
[03:16:13.126 --> 03:16:14.467]  We go to the Jerusalem Post.
[03:16:14.547 --> 03:16:16.288]  Aha, that's... Subscribe to it.
[03:16:18.870 --> 03:16:19.711]  Times of Israel.
[03:16:19.951 --> 03:16:20.031]  Oh!
[03:16:20.831 --> 03:16:22.312]  Now you'll hate us for this!
[03:16:23.073 --> 03:16:25.815]  You slobby little prostitutes!
[03:16:26.502 --> 03:16:30.504]  We also go to ISNA, IRNA, Tehran News.
[03:16:30.784 --> 03:16:31.904]  Yeah, the Iranians.
[03:16:32.224 --> 03:16:33.665]  Yeah, we want to hear what they have to say.
[03:16:33.985 --> 03:16:34.305]  Why?
[03:16:34.405 --> 03:16:36.406]  How dare you believe them?
[03:16:36.866 --> 03:16:40.148]  You are only allowed to swallow our crap.
[03:16:40.708 --> 03:16:43.449]  Oh, and believe what the Israeli government tells you, too.
[03:16:44.329 --> 03:16:46.190]  You're not allowed to think for yourself.
[03:16:48.131 --> 03:16:50.252]  Think for yourself is a crime.
[03:16:52.230 --> 03:16:54.051]  Stand six feet apart!
[03:16:54.531 --> 03:16:57.852]  The wind blows exactly in state lines at six feet!
[03:16:58.592 --> 03:17:01.233]  Put on that mask when you get in an airplane!
[03:17:01.533 --> 03:17:03.914]  But you gotta take it off when you're eating and drinking!
[03:17:04.434 --> 03:17:06.935]  Because COVID knows when you're eating and drinking it ain't gonna bother ya!
[03:17:07.195 --> 03:17:08.696]  Even though you're surrounded by people!
[03:17:09.276 --> 03:17:12.217]  And don't forget... Masturbate!
[03:17:12.237 --> 03:17:14.478]  Don't forget to sanitize your hands!
[03:17:16.518 --> 03:17:18.959]  Look at the crap they make!
[03:17:20.080 --> 03:17:21.140]  Look at the crap they make!
[03:17:23.223 --> 03:17:26.484]  So, going back to Infowars and this article.
[03:17:28.704 --> 03:17:30.605]  RINO's call for World War III.
[03:17:31.685 --> 03:17:32.926]  GOP senators.
[03:17:33.406 --> 03:17:36.086]  GOP pieces of scum!
[03:17:36.607 --> 03:17:37.667]  What senator?
[03:17:39.067 --> 03:17:41.348]  Oh, dead in your eyes, Mitch McConnell?
[03:17:42.288 --> 03:17:45.849]  We gotta go, we gotta go fight over there in Ireland!
[03:17:46.329 --> 03:17:47.830]  Hey, hey, hey!
[03:17:48.810 --> 03:17:49.490]  Hey, Dimwit!
[03:17:50.106 --> 03:17:51.707]  Hey, Dimwit, go over there and fight!
[03:17:52.127 --> 03:17:54.408]  Oh, how about little Lindsey Graham?
[03:17:54.488 --> 03:17:54.849]  Yeah!
[03:17:55.329 --> 03:17:56.570]  Oh, talking about rhinos?
[03:17:56.810 --> 03:17:58.130]  Hey, slobby boy!
[03:17:58.151 --> 03:17:59.992]  Oh, you love war, don't you?
[03:18:00.572 --> 03:18:02.153]  Oh, and how about Tom Cotton?
[03:18:02.233 --> 03:18:03.353]  I was in the military!
[03:18:03.774 --> 03:18:05.014]  Go over there and fight!
[03:18:05.294 --> 03:18:07.316]  Hey, all you little clowns!
[03:18:08.156 --> 03:18:10.717]  I, Gerald Solenti, am an American.
[03:18:11.938 --> 03:18:14.400]  I believe in the Founding Fathers, which you hate.
[03:18:14.900 --> 03:18:16.561]  Just like you hate the Constitution.
[03:18:16.881 --> 03:18:18.442]  Just like you hate the Bill of Rights.
[03:18:20.413 --> 03:18:21.714]  Yeah, George Washington.
[03:18:21.794 --> 03:18:22.615]  Oh, did you ever hear of him?
[03:18:22.675 --> 03:18:23.376]  Cotton boy!
[03:18:23.396 --> 03:18:24.897]  Hey, cotton mouth!
[03:18:25.398 --> 03:18:26.218]  Cotton mouth!
[03:18:26.238 --> 03:18:28.100]  Did you ever hear of George Washington?
[03:18:28.701 --> 03:18:31.003]  Don't become involved in any foreign entanglements.
[03:18:32.344 --> 03:18:34.446]  Don't love a nation, don't hate a nation.
[03:18:34.786 --> 03:18:36.868]  Because if you do, you become a slave to them.
[03:18:40.051 --> 03:18:43.875]  Hey, we live in a slave land here, so I guess we should be slaves.
[03:18:47.637 --> 03:18:51.220]  After news broke over the weekend of a drone attack on a U.S.
[03:18:51.280 --> 03:19:05.071]  military outpost in northeast Jordan that killed three American troops and injured 34 others, several GOP politicians, again this is on InfoWars, called for reactionary strikes on Iran.
[03:19:05.852 --> 03:19:13.591]   South Carolina Republican slobby Lindsey Graham wrote Hit Iran now!
[03:19:13.991 --> 03:19:15.031]  Hit them hard!
[03:19:15.511 --> 03:19:16.672]  Target Tehran!
[03:19:17.092 --> 03:19:20.454]  Wrote Republican Senator John Cronin.
[03:19:24.675 --> 03:19:26.675]  Nikki Haley.
[03:19:26.675 --> 03:19:36.274]   Striking or running targets would not escalate things in potential war with a
[03:19:36.481 --> 03:19:37.801]  Oh yeah, listen to Nikki Haley.
[03:19:38.182 --> 03:19:41.003]  Out of her stupid mind, little nothing of a clown.
[03:19:42.219 --> 03:19:44.981]  Oh, I forgot she was an ex-UN ambassador!
[03:19:44.800 --> 03:20:02.800]   Yep. Yep. Yep. And by the way, this fat mouth Lindsey Graham has been calling to bomb Iran
[03:20:02.800 --> 03:20:04.200]  now for how many times?
[03:20:04.200 --> 03:20:14.200]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:20:05.392 --> 03:20:07.174]  World War III's begun.
[03:20:07.194 --> 03:20:09.635]  They're going to escalate it.
[03:20:10.603 --> 03:20:15.525]  And then you read the articles about, you know, what's going on here.
[03:20:17.006 --> 03:20:21.287]  Iran wraps UK for baseless claim on base attack.
[03:20:22.068 --> 03:20:24.909]  Again, we go to IRNA, want to hear what the Iranians say.
[03:20:26.764 --> 03:20:36.908]  Iranian Foreign Minister has called baseless the UK accusation and put an F and a C in that UK because that's the clowns that are running this show.
[03:20:37.188 --> 03:20:40.009]  Oh, that little arrogant boy Cameron's back!
[03:20:40.329 --> 03:20:46.552]  Oh, the little jerk that helped with Obama and Sarkozy, the little slimeball of France.
[03:20:47.052 --> 03:20:57.814]  And the Nobel Piece of Crap Prize winner, Barack Obama, along with Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power, and Susan Rice, that gave us the Libyan war that overthrew Gaddafi?
[03:20:58.194 --> 03:21:02.255]  Oh yeah, that's slimeball Cameron over there in the UK.
[03:21:03.155 --> 03:21:05.155]  Yeah, Gaddafi has to go!
[03:21:05.416 --> 03:21:06.176]  No, don't say it.
[03:21:06.276 --> 03:21:08.156]  Folks, folks, Gaddafi has to go.
[03:21:08.176 --> 03:21:13.057]  Obama, folks, folks, always folks, folks, poking us all the time.
[03:21:15.247 --> 03:21:20.189]  Yep, lashed out at British Foreign Minister David Cameron for his anti-Tehran rhetoric.
[03:21:20.770 --> 03:21:36.797]  These claims are made with specific political goals to reverse the realities of the region and also indicate that they are influenced by third parties, including, hate you for this, child-killing Zionist regime.
[03:21:37.097 --> 03:21:41.736]  Oh yeah, 25,000.
[03:21:41.736 --> 03:21:54.698]   25,000 children now according to the latest UN report have lost their parents, became orphans in Gaza.
[03:21:54.890 --> 03:21:57.591]  Over 26,000 people have been killed.
[03:21:57.611 --> 03:22:04.154]  40% of them children, 30% of them women.
[03:22:08.635 --> 03:22:09.596]  In God we trust?
[03:22:09.415 --> 03:22:11.415]  Russ, what god you talking about?
[03:22:11.415 --> 03:22:19.815]  Yep, that's that clown Cameron.
[03:22:19.815 --> 03:22:23.815]   *Sigh* [Sigh]
[03:22:23.815 --> 03:22:25.875]   *sigh* [CLICK]
[03:22:25.690 --> 03:22:26.850]  And then you think about this.
[03:22:28.111 --> 03:22:35.416]  There's another article from the CNBC.
[03:22:37.077 --> 03:22:44.803]  Oil prices higher after Iran-linked drone strike kills three US troops.
[03:22:46.092 --> 03:22:48.214]  Biden vows retaliation.
[03:22:52.237 --> 03:22:52.718]  Check it out.
[03:22:54.139 --> 03:22:57.962]  After Iran-linked drone strike kills three U.S.
[03:22:58.002 --> 03:22:58.342]  troops.
[03:22:58.622 --> 03:22:58.823]  Huh.
[03:22:59.803 --> 03:23:12.874]  How about if it read oil prices higher after U.S.-linked drone strike kills Russian troops?
[03:23:13.775 --> 03:23:14.896]  No, no, Salenti!
[03:23:16.076 --> 03:23:34.481]  America can give all the weapons they want to kill anybody that they want, but how dare, how dare Iran would give weapons to people that want the United States the hell out of the Middle East.
[03:23:35.662 --> 03:23:55.488]   And by the way, the reports are coming in, this, this, uh, where their base was, where they say it's, um, In the northeastern, northeast Jordan outpost near the Syria border, there are reports coming in that this is actually in Syria.
[03:23:55.869 --> 03:24:05.057]  And as we know, American troops are in Syria, where we have absolutely no right to be there.
[03:24:05.558 --> 03:24:07.900]  Why the hell would you, Salenti?
[03:24:08.120 --> 03:24:09.661]  We're there getting ISIS's.
[03:24:10.462 --> 03:24:12.645]  We're gonna melt down them Isises!
[03:24:13.145 --> 03:24:17.170]  We can go to any country we want and kill anybody we want!
[03:24:17.610 --> 03:24:19.512]  In the name of getting Isises!
[03:24:19.973 --> 03:24:26.000]  Hey, how about that Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, Barack Obama!
[03:24:27.450 --> 03:24:30.571]  O-B-O-M-B-A, Obama!
[03:24:30.851 --> 03:24:35.473]  That's now a multi, multi, multi, multimillionaire!
[03:24:35.493 --> 03:24:37.534]  A little boy of nothing!
[03:24:37.994 --> 03:24:39.775]  Now worth all that dough.
[03:24:39.935 --> 03:24:44.657]  Quoted in the book, Double Down, I'm really good at killing people.
[03:24:45.377 --> 03:24:45.577]  Yeah.
[03:24:46.437 --> 03:24:47.137]  I'm making that up.
[03:24:48.098 --> 03:24:51.919]  So America has no damn right to be in Syria.
[03:24:52.259 --> 03:24:56.061]  Oh, by the way, I launched Occupy Peace a decade ago.
[03:24:57.085 --> 03:24:57.786]  That's right.
[03:24:57.806 --> 03:25:21.747]  I was looking to leave the country because of that scum, warmongering, lying little piece of crap, Barack Obama, who lied his way into office as a peace candidate, wrote about it in the Trends Journal when it happened, and as soon as he gets elected, yeah, the Afghan troops will age.
[03:25:22.988 --> 03:25:23.188]  Yeah.
[03:25:25.600 --> 03:25:27.301]  We have no right being in these countries.
[03:25:28.802 --> 03:25:33.384]  America, hey, I don't want my money.
[03:25:33.804 --> 03:25:35.165]  I work very hard.
[03:25:36.165 --> 03:25:38.426]  I don't want my tax money going to killing people.
[03:25:40.007 --> 03:25:41.828]  And last week, I forgot what I was talking about.
[03:25:41.848 --> 03:25:43.248]  I remember I was talking about taxes.
[03:25:44.969 --> 03:25:46.430]  It's the tax thing is ridiculous.
[03:25:46.490 --> 03:25:52.553]  Again, brought to us by a warmongering scumbag, may he rot in hell, who gave us the Federal Reserve.
[03:25:55.146 --> 03:26:01.611]  And Federal Income Tax, and World War I, Woodrow Wilson.
[03:26:02.311 --> 03:26:01.611]  1%!
[03:26:02.731 --> 03:26:06.634]  1% Federal Income Tax, and now it's like in the 40% range for the top.
[03:26:07.595 --> 03:26:08.595]  And the top ain't that high.
[03:26:08.616 --> 03:26:09.196]  You get the 40%.
[03:26:09.436 --> 03:26:15.540]  Yeah, while the bigs get all their money offshore, they don't pay nothing!
[03:26:15.861 --> 03:26:16.721]  They pay nothing!
[03:26:17.702 --> 03:26:18.042]  Nothing!
[03:26:18.703 --> 03:26:20.003]  Compared to the billions that they make.
[03:26:21.424 --> 03:26:26.718]   So, I was mentioning, I forgot, It's school taxes that I pay.
[03:26:26.758 --> 03:26:27.479]  I never had any kids.
[03:26:27.539 --> 03:26:32.280]  I was mentioning, my mother, may she rest in peace, you know, I was the youngest of five.
[03:26:32.300 --> 03:26:33.200]  They couldn't control me.
[03:26:33.240 --> 03:26:35.120]  Born in 1946, you know.
[03:26:35.220 --> 03:26:35.420]  Woo!
[03:26:36.081 --> 03:26:37.521]  Time Americans at its height.
[03:26:37.621 --> 03:26:38.241]  The energy.
[03:26:38.301 --> 03:26:39.802]  America just won World War II.
[03:26:40.002 --> 03:26:41.682]  You can't imagine the energy.
[03:26:41.942 --> 03:26:43.322]  And I'm feeling it as a kid.
[03:26:43.662 --> 03:26:44.723]  So they couldn't control me.
[03:26:45.203 --> 03:26:46.223]  So I never had any kids.
[03:26:46.303 --> 03:26:48.564]  My mother wished I had three worse than me.
[03:26:48.924 --> 03:26:50.224]  Couldn't imagine one like me.
[03:26:52.765 --> 03:26:53.865]  I don't want to pay school taxes.
[03:26:55.120 --> 03:26:55.821]  Here's my deal.
[03:26:56.201 --> 03:27:00.704]  First of all, the government school system stinks!
[03:27:01.184 --> 03:27:03.766]  I hated every day of school.
[03:27:05.207 --> 03:27:05.967]  So here's the deal.
[03:27:06.728 --> 03:27:10.751]  The more kids you have, the more taxes you should pay.
[03:27:10.771 --> 03:27:12.011]  Yeah.
[03:27:12.772 --> 03:27:17.215]  Oh, and don't give me the crap of, we're educating our kids so they'll be able to take care of you when you get old.
[03:27:17.835 --> 03:27:22.939]  You're not talking, I'm still not in kindergarten, but the rest of America is.
[03:27:23.823 --> 03:27:38.430]  Most of America, not the people at Infowars who subscribe to the Trends Journal, listen to Scott Ritter, Judge Napolitano, Douglas McGregor, you know, those kind, you know, Dr. McCullough, you know, there's those cool cats out there that, you know, we're there.
[03:27:39.130 --> 03:27:51.796]  But the masses, I mean, they tell us... By the way, I mentioned this before, I put on a concert when I was the number two guy running a major trade association in Atlanta.
[03:27:52.543 --> 03:27:55.664]  In the late 1970s, with Ella Fitzgerald.
[03:27:56.565 --> 03:27:57.966]  I told you I was Taylor Swift!
[03:27:58.226 --> 03:27:59.086]  Take it easy!
[03:27:59.106 --> 03:28:05.969]  Yeah, we went backstage and she said to my former wife, You look like my goddaughter, Carmen.
[03:28:07.210 --> 03:28:13.673]  I took her to the Superbowl, and put on one for Dionne Warwick.
[03:28:14.413 --> 03:28:16.254]  I got to hear about Taylor Swift, ooh!
[03:28:16.454 --> 03:28:18.975]  Was he kissing a boyfriend?
[03:28:19.735 --> 03:28:20.716]  Grow the hell up!
[03:28:22.614 --> 03:28:27.178]  Go to Drudge, go to the Cartoon News Network, CNN, that's all the crap you see!
[03:28:30.341 --> 03:28:31.142]  They're going back.
[03:28:32.223 --> 03:28:34.806]  This is serious, this, this, what's going on now.
[03:28:35.446 --> 03:28:37.488]  America has no right to be overseas.
[03:28:38.509 --> 03:28:41.312]  Part of occupied peace has closed down all the bases.
[03:28:41.992 --> 03:28:43.494]  Boy, there's 700 bases in, oh, what, 70 cities.
[03:28:43.514 --> 03:28:45.316]  800 bases over in 70 countries, excuse me.
[03:28:49.358 --> 03:28:50.299]  Bring home the troops.
[03:28:50.699 --> 03:28:52.840]  Secure the homeland.
[03:28:57.522 --> 03:28:58.823]  That's occupied peace.
[03:28:59.723 --> 03:29:01.304]  No foreign entanglements.
[03:29:02.084 --> 03:29:03.125]  You want to go to war?
[03:29:03.145 --> 03:29:04.206]  Let the people vote.
[03:29:07.087 --> 03:29:11.629]  And put the troops to get to work rebuilding our third world infrastructure.
[03:29:12.750 --> 03:29:13.650]  What a joke.
[03:29:14.391 --> 03:29:16.392]  I just blew the front end of my car out.
[03:29:17.572 --> 03:29:18.633]  Hitting potholes.
[03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:21.681]  The bridges look like crap.
[03:29:23.382 --> 03:29:26.123]  Our rail system is third world.
[03:29:26.723 --> 03:29:30.065]  Take a trip on the subway in New York, it's a night in Calcutta.
[03:29:31.865 --> 03:29:37.828]  While we're sending trillions of dollars a year to the military-industrial complex.
[03:29:42.430 --> 03:29:44.571]  Rhino's call for World War III.
[03:29:46.692 --> 03:29:47.612]  What else we got here?
[03:29:48.653 --> 03:29:48.833]  Yeah.
[03:29:51.624 --> 03:29:54.065]  Again, your Trends Journal uses some of the stories.
[03:29:55.566 --> 03:30:00.267]  Prestitutes, media whores pump up politicians call for war with Iran.
[03:30:03.609 --> 03:30:07.810]  Iran a legitimate target top Israeli official says.
[03:30:10.251 --> 03:30:16.434]  Biden ramps up war after Iran backed militias and quote kill three US troops.
[03:30:18.268 --> 03:30:19.669]  Ready to steal more land?
[03:30:19.729 --> 03:30:21.870]  Israel maps out buffer zone in Gaza.
[03:30:22.291 --> 03:30:24.012]  This crap about settlements.
[03:30:24.953 --> 03:30:25.473]  Saving.
[03:30:26.614 --> 03:30:28.075]  It's stolen land.
[03:30:28.995 --> 03:30:30.696]  And you're going to steal more now?
[03:30:31.677 --> 03:30:33.618]  It's in violation since 1967.
[03:30:34.359 --> 03:30:36.020]  The settlements.
[03:30:36.380 --> 03:30:37.121]  The settlements.
[03:30:37.161 --> 03:30:38.121]  What settlements?
[03:30:38.442 --> 03:30:43.885]  It's stolen land in violation of the Geneva Convention and Article 242.
[03:30:46.457 --> 03:30:47.598]  Of the United Nations.
[03:30:47.938 --> 03:30:49.099]  United nothings.
[03:30:51.521 --> 03:30:52.061]  So anyway.
[03:30:53.983 --> 03:30:55.644]  Yep.
[03:30:55.684 --> 03:31:00.067]  This is, it's really getting, yep.
[03:31:00.087 --> 03:31:06.432]  The ruling about genocide, land steal, top Israeli MKs want post-war settlements in Gaza.
[03:31:06.652 --> 03:31:08.053]  Right here.
[03:31:08.934 --> 03:31:11.956]  Settlements, save the word, turd.
[03:31:14.429 --> 03:31:17.530]  Again, the oil prices go back to your Trends Journal.
[03:31:18.070 --> 03:31:30.553]  We've been warning that if the United States and Israel go to war against Iran, military confrontation breaks out, oil prices, Brent crude is going to spike to above $130 a barrel.
[03:31:31.113 --> 03:31:36.954]  When that happens, kiss the economy and the equity markets goodbye.
[03:31:38.414 --> 03:31:41.475]  I'm going back to Biden ramping up war with Iran.
[03:31:42.338 --> 03:31:46.361]  You know, one of my sayings, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:31:47.302 --> 03:31:54.407]  And Biden's polls are in the toilet, along with Netanyahu's polls in the toilet, and they keep taking you to war.
[03:31:55.087 --> 03:32:06.856]  Again, we detailed, right after it happened, after the Hamas attack, terrible Hamas attack, how the United States and Egypt, two days after it happened, had warned Israel it was going to happen.
[03:32:07.403 --> 03:32:08.804]  And you see all the other data.
[03:32:09.304 --> 03:32:11.805]  Trump's doing this, Biden's doing the same thing.
[03:32:12.205 --> 03:32:14.606]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:32:15.706 --> 03:32:17.307]  The economy's ready to fail.
[03:32:18.187 --> 03:32:19.868]  The global economy's failing.
[03:32:20.608 --> 03:32:26.110]  And if this war ramps up, again, the oil prices, you know why the oil prices went down a little today?
[03:32:27.131 --> 03:32:30.352]  Because the economy stinks in China.
[03:32:31.189 --> 03:32:33.130]  When we get back, I'm very happy!
[03:32:33.790 --> 03:32:38.012]  The Second American Revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[03:32:38.332 --> 03:32:42.694]  And you're tuned in to InfoWars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a Patreon.
[03:32:43.174 --> 03:32:51.018]  I'm asking you now to realize we are at the fulcrum, the crossroads in the fight for human destiny and human future.
[03:32:51.678 --> 03:32:53.399]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[03:32:53.859 --> 03:32:55.861]  Please buy great products at FortWorthStore.com.
[03:32:56.181 --> 03:32:59.123]  And please pray for the transmission.
[03:32:59.403 --> 03:33:00.564]  Without you, we're going to fail.
[03:33:01.004 --> 03:33:10.090]  But if you simply take action and spread the word and pray for the broadcast and buy the products, you will continue to aid us together.
[03:33:10.450 --> 03:33:11.671]  In our victory against these tyrants.
[03:33:11.971 --> 03:33:13.552]  But now is the time to make the decision.
[03:33:14.093 --> 03:33:18.877]  I know there's millions of forms of media out there and all this BS and the globalists hope you get lost in all of it.
[03:33:19.257 --> 03:33:23.920]  But notice the globalists, the New World Order, are coming after us because they realize we've got their number.
[03:33:24.781 --> 03:33:25.582]  Think about it.
[03:33:25.602 --> 03:33:26.903]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[03:33:26.923 --> 03:33:30.405]  If you want to support the tip of the spear, that decision is up to you.
[03:33:30.485 --> 03:33:32.485]  Please support us now at Fuller Store.
[03:33:33.125 --> 03:33:36.284]   Hey great being on the Alex Jones show, you know, I gotta tell you I gotta
[03:33:36.284 --> 03:33:41.605]   The only reason that I'm so Pumped up. It's not my fault
[03:33:41.605 --> 03:33:43.605]  fault.
[03:33:43.638 --> 03:33:48.062]  It's because of, uh, super male vitality.
[03:33:48.822 --> 03:33:51.004]  Every time I take it, I just can't control myself.
[03:33:51.044 --> 03:33:52.305]  I got that vitality.
[03:33:53.586 --> 03:34:00.212]  Man, I'll tell you, I was down in Florida and I see people my age and they go, oh, Marlon, I hope I don't look like that.
[03:34:01.528 --> 03:34:02.668]  Holy Jesus.
[03:34:03.289 --> 03:34:08.010]  So anyway, it's really important to take these products that they have because they really help you in a lot of different ways.
[03:34:08.110 --> 03:34:12.452]  So anyway, there's a article that came out in Newsweek.
[03:34:12.512 --> 03:34:19.494]  And again, we're talking about the importance of, you know, supporting InfoWars with the Great Awakening because everybody's greatly dead.
[03:34:19.514 --> 03:34:21.715]  There's a great book for you to look at.
[03:34:23.175 --> 03:34:24.196]  This is from Newsweek.
[03:34:24.436 --> 03:34:24.796]  You ready?
[03:34:25.136 --> 03:34:28.117]  This is an example of propaganda.
[03:34:31.361 --> 03:34:33.702]  They should call it impropaganda.
[03:34:33.722 --> 03:34:35.063]  There's nothing proper about it.
[03:34:36.403 --> 03:34:40.105]  Russian state TV predicts World War III.
[03:34:41.646 --> 03:34:42.466]  A top, ready?
[03:34:42.986 --> 03:34:49.209]  Kremlin propagandist predicted that World War III will break out in the Middle East.
[03:34:52.071 --> 03:34:52.831]  Propagandist?
[03:34:55.112 --> 03:34:57.033]  Why is this person a propagandist?
[03:34:57.722 --> 03:35:04.964]  Hey, clown boys and girls in Newsweek, maybe you're too damn stupid to read the Trends Journal.
[03:35:06.564 --> 03:35:11.165]  And matter of fact, maybe that Russian propagandist read the Trends Journal.
[03:35:11.705 --> 03:35:17.347]  Because, little boys and girls, that no Newsweek, it's just Crap Week.
[03:35:18.327 --> 03:35:21.128]  Look at one of our top trends for 2023.
[03:35:21.568 --> 03:35:26.429]  Idiots, morons, slimeballs, and propagandists.
[03:35:27.310 --> 03:35:28.390]  Middle East meltdown.
[03:35:29.351 --> 03:35:29.851]  That's right.
[03:35:30.911 --> 03:35:35.973]  Warned about what's going on now a year ago, January 3rd, 2023.
[03:35:39.194 --> 03:35:40.194]  Middle East meltdown.
[03:35:40.794 --> 03:35:45.395]  Because they say here, World War Three will break out in the Middle East.
[03:35:45.855 --> 03:35:50.255]  Oh, and little slime balls over there.
[03:35:50.255 --> 03:35:57.534]  World War III.
[03:35:57.671 --> 03:36:00.112]  One of our top trends for 2024.
[03:36:01.934 --> 03:36:07.257]  A top Kremlin propagandist predicted that World War III will break out in the Middle East, as of course we have said.
[03:36:07.277 --> 03:36:19.103]  And Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of the Russian state-controlled media organization.
[03:36:19.624 --> 03:36:21.925]  A Russia state-controlled media organization?
[03:36:22.465 --> 03:36:22.845]  You like NPR?
[03:36:24.525 --> 03:36:26.666]  That government-controlled media organization?
[03:36:26.986 --> 03:36:28.106]  You can't say that!
[03:36:28.486 --> 03:36:31.547]  There's no democracy in America!
[03:36:32.207 --> 03:36:34.308]  You must swallow our crap!
[03:36:36.068 --> 03:36:37.749]  Only believe what we tell you!
[03:36:38.049 --> 03:36:39.769]  Oh, that democracy in America?
[03:36:43.050 --> 03:36:47.212]  Bader comments in a state TV broadcast.
[03:36:48.132 --> 03:36:56.450]   Goes on to say, again, Kremlin propagandists Have routinely warned of a looming world war.
[03:36:56.670 --> 03:36:56.870]  Huh.
[03:36:58.791 --> 03:37:01.293]  I guess I must be a Kremlin propagandist.
[03:37:04.895 --> 03:37:15.080]  Because I've been warning about World War Three when you stupid little boys and girls in Newsweek, a crap of nothing.
[03:37:16.741 --> 03:37:36.654]   When you look at the cover of our Trends Journal on February 22nd, 2022, two days before the Ukraine war, it read from COVID war to Ukraine war to world war.
[03:37:37.394 --> 03:37:40.436]  So I guess I must be as a trend forecaster.
[03:37:40.456 --> 03:37:51.140]  Oh, by the way, by the way, little boys and girls at Newsweek, Trends 2000, international bestselling book, my book.
[03:37:54.904 --> 03:37:55.665]  Trend tracking.
[03:37:56.385 --> 03:37:58.367]  Far better than Megatrends, Time Magazine.
[03:37:59.388 --> 03:37:59.888]  My book.
[03:38:00.689 --> 03:38:07.154]  I know a thing or two about trends, and I will put my trend forecasting track record up against anybody in the world.
[03:38:07.494 --> 03:38:07.894]  That's right.
[03:38:08.315 --> 03:38:11.377]  Show me all the trends that you forecast, and then we can begin to talk.
[03:38:12.698 --> 03:38:14.119]  But they call me a propagandist.
[03:38:18.083 --> 03:38:18.263]  Yep.
[03:38:20.364 --> 03:38:22.006]  Will there be a World War III?
[03:38:22.921 --> 03:38:25.524]  I think that World War 3 will certainly happen, she said.
[03:38:25.544 --> 03:38:28.388]  There's bad news, ba-ba-ba-ba, yep.
[03:38:29.689 --> 03:38:30.210]  So that's it.
[03:38:31.792 --> 03:38:45.723]   That's the stuff that they keep putting out and why you need to support InfoWars, and of course the Trends Journal, and you can go to jonestrends.com, jonestrends.com, And read history before it happens.
[03:38:45.763 --> 03:38:49.386]  You could subscribe to the Trends Journal and you get a nice discount as well.
[03:38:49.966 --> 03:38:52.808]  And it's less than $2 and about 50 cents a week.
[03:38:53.488 --> 03:38:53.869]  A week!
[03:38:54.669 --> 03:38:54.889]  Yeah.
[03:38:57.631 --> 03:38:59.032]  The Wall Street Journal.
[03:38:59.072 --> 03:39:00.453]  I can't put the right name in there.
[03:39:00.473 --> 03:39:04.076]  I'm gonna start with an S and an H.
[03:39:04.096 --> 03:39:07.778]  $5 a day, $6 on the weekend like the toilet paper record, the New York Times.
[03:39:08.138 --> 03:39:08.759]  You get nothing.
[03:39:09.479 --> 03:39:10.420]  So we're giving you everything.
[03:39:11.881 --> 03:39:12.061]  So.
[03:39:12.962 --> 03:39:13.182]  Here's.
[03:39:13.717 --> 03:39:19.159]  An opinion piece from today's Financial Times.
[03:39:20.059 --> 03:39:22.460]  Why political leaders are so unpopular now?
[03:39:24.681 --> 03:39:27.002]  The writer is a chair at the Rockefeller International.
[03:39:27.502 --> 03:39:29.023]  I need this guy to tell us stuff?
[03:39:31.063 --> 03:39:33.965]  Joe Biden's low popularity rating get a lot of attention.
[03:39:34.045 --> 03:39:37.666]  Yet leaders across the developed world are in a similar predicament.
[03:39:37.906 --> 03:39:40.427]  All right, let's take that language from this little boy over here.
[03:39:42.308 --> 03:39:42.728]  Leaders?
[03:39:44.036 --> 03:39:50.881]  How can you be so stupid to let these pieces of crap be your leader?
[03:39:52.582 --> 03:39:56.405]  How can you be so dumb to take orders?
[03:39:57.666 --> 03:39:58.487]  I'm a leader.
[03:39:58.687 --> 03:40:00.989]  I'm a piece of political scum.
[03:40:01.689 --> 03:40:06.573]  I've been sucking off the public, you know what, for my whole life.
[03:40:07.314 --> 03:40:08.074]  I'm Joe Biden.
[03:40:08.194 --> 03:40:09.875]  I've been doing it for 60 years.
[03:40:11.196 --> 03:40:11.777]  That's right.
[03:40:13.010 --> 03:40:14.291]  Little Lindsey Graham.
[03:40:15.431 --> 03:40:16.832]  Chucky Schumer.
[03:40:17.712 --> 03:40:18.612]  Adam Schipp.
[03:40:23.354 --> 03:40:23.675]  Look at him.
[03:40:25.075 --> 03:40:25.955]  Lindsey Graham.
[03:40:28.737 --> 03:40:29.597]  Mitch McConnell.
[03:40:32.078 --> 03:40:32.918]  All over the world.
[03:40:33.319 --> 03:40:36.120]  Little Katson Macron with his little fake hair.
[03:40:36.140 --> 03:40:38.841]  And his thing about this big.
[03:40:42.239 --> 03:40:42.960]  Sunak!
[03:40:43.120 --> 03:40:43.701]  Scum!
[03:40:44.241 --> 03:40:48.025]  Over there in the UK, as I said, put an F and a C in there too.
[03:40:48.045 --> 03:40:52.208]  Oh, and that guy Cameron, that's the secretary of this and that.
[03:40:52.328 --> 03:40:53.610]  Yeah, he's a former, yeah.
[03:40:54.270 --> 03:40:56.512]  Oh, how about Boris Johnson before him?
[03:40:57.013 --> 03:41:00.336]  The best cartoonist in the world couldn't come up with a clownier figure.
[03:41:01.577 --> 03:41:03.659]  These are the people running our lives.
[03:41:04.580 --> 03:41:06.942]  Why political leaders are so unpopular.
[03:41:07.566 --> 03:41:12.347]  Because you gotta be a stupid moron to swallow their crap.
[03:41:12.727 --> 03:41:13.767]  Got it, Junior?
[03:41:14.207 --> 03:41:16.068]  Oh no, I'm with the Rockefeller!
[03:41:16.568 --> 03:41:18.168]  Oh yeah, the Rockefeller!
[03:41:18.748 --> 03:41:21.769]  Another guy, another crime syndicate!
[03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:26.570]  How do you think they got so rich?
[03:41:28.370 --> 03:41:29.971]  Oh, we're better than everybody else.
[03:41:31.191 --> 03:41:32.671]  We're like royalty.
[03:41:34.052 --> 03:41:35.592]  We don't peen, we don't poo.
[03:41:37.069 --> 03:41:39.171]  All we do is know how to F you.
[03:41:40.111 --> 03:41:42.373]  Steal what you got and keep what we want.
[03:41:45.516 --> 03:41:50.319]  Again, five billionaires double their wealth in two years.
[03:41:52.581 --> 03:41:54.202]  As everybody else gets poorer.
[03:41:54.462 --> 03:41:55.303]  Can't buy a house?
[03:41:55.623 --> 03:41:56.384]  Living in the street?
[03:41:56.424 --> 03:41:57.425]  Don't worry about it.
[03:41:59.466 --> 03:42:00.447]  Slaylandia.
[03:42:01.568 --> 03:42:01.728]  Yep.
[03:42:06.408 --> 03:42:07.229]  It's a freak show.
[03:42:08.490 --> 03:42:09.330]  It's a freak show.
[03:42:11.172 --> 03:42:13.834]  A 37% Biden's rating is at a record low.
[03:42:14.274 --> 03:42:14.634]  Oh yeah.
[03:42:15.355 --> 03:42:15.795]  For a U.S.
[03:42:15.855 --> 03:42:17.236]  President late in his first term.
[03:42:19.278 --> 03:42:19.578]  Got it?
[03:42:20.188 --> 03:42:26.611]  When all else fails, they take you to war, and that's where we're going.
[03:42:27.271 --> 03:42:28.851]  But don't worry about it, eh?
[03:42:29.192 --> 03:42:32.653]  If a nuclear bomb goes off, here's what to do.
[03:42:33.133 --> 03:42:35.674]  Yeah, they have those stupid commercials, here's what to do.
[03:42:35.914 --> 03:42:37.875]  You bend over and kiss your butt goodbye.
[03:42:37.895 --> 03:42:38.655]  How about that?
[03:42:38.855 --> 03:42:41.636]  Oh no, I got a tunnel I'm gonna hide in.
[03:42:41.696 --> 03:42:43.197]  Oh, and life will be wonderful after.
[03:42:45.799 --> 03:42:48.041]  We're in trouble if we don't unite for peace.
[03:42:48.722 --> 03:42:50.183]  We'll take a break and we'll be right back.
[03:42:52.265 --> 03:42:54.566]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show!

[03:45:03.341 --> 03:45:11.466]  Got to get that information out there because we're being blacklisted and the only people running the show are the freaks in charge.
[03:45:12.767 --> 03:45:12.947]  Yep.
[03:45:14.488 --> 03:45:23.054]  Matter of fact, speaking about the freaks in charge, and you know, I had a rally up here in, um, in Kingston.
[03:45:23.094 --> 03:45:27.357]  I have them all the many times they can have me every year, Occupy Peace.
[03:45:28.798 --> 03:45:34.180]   And, um, I heard this guy called me a Putin puppet because I had a peace rally.
[03:45:34.961 --> 03:45:36.021]  I went after this guy.
[03:45:37.102 --> 03:45:41.864]  Never expected 70, I was only 76 back then.
[03:45:42.944 --> 03:45:45.025]  They would come over here and you call me that.
[03:45:45.765 --> 03:45:48.246]  Don't you, little coward of a boy.
[03:45:49.607 --> 03:45:51.968]  Again, you gotta get in the best shape you can.
[03:45:53.348 --> 03:45:54.569]  So they, that's what they do.
[03:45:54.629 --> 03:45:55.929]  If you come out against them.
[03:45:57.230 --> 03:46:00.011]  My tenant, one of my tenants closed down their shop, their coffee shop.
[03:46:00.839 --> 03:46:01.960]  Called it a political rally.
[03:46:02.240 --> 03:46:04.181]  Like Judge Napolitano, here's Scott Ritter.
[03:46:04.201 --> 03:46:06.063]  Of course it's a political rally.
[03:46:06.123 --> 03:46:07.924]  Peace is not a political rally.
[03:46:08.444 --> 03:46:10.245]  But this is the hatred that they sell.
[03:46:10.626 --> 03:46:12.527]  And you got this other little daddy's girl.
[03:46:12.547 --> 03:46:14.248]  Don't you know who my daddy was?
[03:46:14.548 --> 03:46:15.769]  My daddy was the mayor of Baltimore.
[03:46:15.789 --> 03:46:17.010]  My mother was a congressman.
[03:46:17.270 --> 03:46:23.795]  I'm from that family where we just get anything that we want and become multi-multi-millionaires.
[03:46:24.095 --> 03:46:25.576]  My name is Nancy Pelosi.
[03:46:28.294 --> 03:46:32.656]  Nancy Pelosi says call for Gaza ceasefire is Putin's message.
[03:46:33.877 --> 03:46:34.518]  Do you believe this?
[03:46:35.258 --> 03:46:36.659]  This is on antiwar.com.
[03:46:36.699 --> 03:46:37.339]  I just saw this.
[03:46:38.820 --> 03:46:50.446]  She said Sunday that American protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza are spreading the message of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
[03:46:51.307 --> 03:46:54.789]  Quote, for them to call for a ceasefire is Mr. Putin's message.
[03:46:56.963 --> 03:46:58.364]  How about go F yourself?
[03:46:59.725 --> 03:47:00.906]  How dare you call me?
[03:47:02.707 --> 03:47:03.948]  That's what's going on.
[03:47:04.788 --> 03:47:07.130]  And that's why you need to support InfoWars.
[03:47:07.270 --> 03:47:14.514]  And of course, if you want to know what in the world is going on, what's next, what means and what to do, you should subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[03:47:14.634 --> 03:47:16.876]  But you're not getting anything like it anywhere, anyplace.
[03:47:17.236 --> 03:47:23.760]  By the way, gold prices today, they were up about, as I got off the air, about 16 bucks.
[03:47:25.581 --> 03:47:26.102]  CNBC.
[03:47:26.983 --> 03:47:29.005]  Gold firms on Middle East flare-up.
[03:47:29.685 --> 03:47:30.666]  Oh, wow.
[03:47:31.126 --> 03:47:31.746]  Blow me away.
[03:47:31.787 --> 03:47:33.047]  Never would have expected that.
[03:47:33.488 --> 03:47:36.410]  Oh, by the way, one of our top trends for 2023?
[03:47:37.511 --> 03:47:38.711]  Golden year for gold.
[03:47:39.132 --> 03:47:39.712]  That's right.
[03:47:41.894 --> 03:47:43.135]  Again, we give you the facts.
[03:47:44.676 --> 03:47:46.257]  We're not little prostitutes.
[03:47:46.937 --> 03:47:51.881]  Media whores that get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and government whoremasters.
[03:47:52.461 --> 03:47:55.824]  So what else does little Pelosi have to say?
[03:47:58.715 --> 03:48:01.336]  For them to call a ceasefire is Mr. Putin's message.
[03:48:02.036 --> 03:48:07.578]  Make no mistake, this is directly connected to what he would like to see.
[03:48:08.358 --> 03:48:09.499]  Same thing with Ukraine.
[03:48:10.559 --> 03:48:11.940]  It's about the Putin's message.
[03:48:12.360 --> 03:48:22.443]  Could you believe, could you believe that they would put somebody on the media to spew out this crap?
[03:48:23.124 --> 03:48:24.204]  Of course they would.
[03:48:25.364 --> 03:48:26.805]  A little Jakey Tapper!
[03:48:27.578 --> 03:48:30.599]  I'm Anderson Cooper, don't you know who my mommy was?
[03:48:31.079 --> 03:48:34.260]  Gloria Vanderbilt, how do you think I got this job?
[03:48:34.680 --> 03:48:41.321]  Oh, you remember when I got hit over there in Egypt during the Arab Spring and I came home crying?
[03:48:42.301 --> 03:48:42.701]  Yeah!
[03:48:46.162 --> 03:48:46.782]  Goddamn it!
[03:48:48.823 --> 03:49:13.492]   This is the America that slaughters people all over the world In the name of bringing freedom and democracy, while you got these lousy scum, murderous bitches and bastards, killing people all over the world, and when you call for peace, you're a piece of crap!
[03:49:16.534 --> 03:49:19.116]  Stalin would have loved you, Nancy!
[03:49:18.935 --> 03:49:22.854]  "Kyle Hitler, you're right on line!"
[03:49:22.854 --> 03:49:33.534]   And being an Italian, which I am, but a guy didn't like it, you probably loved,
[03:49:33.534 --> 03:49:37.494]  "Mussolini was right in your crowd!"
[03:49:37.494 --> 03:49:47.495]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:49:39.687 --> 03:49:40.648]  Hey, we were kids.
[03:49:41.248 --> 03:49:45.191]  Yeah, World War II, you just stand there, so you still hear this stuff.
[03:49:45.712 --> 03:49:46.732]  Whistle while you work.
[03:49:46.853 --> 03:49:47.833]  Hitler is a jerk.
[03:49:48.214 --> 03:49:49.775]  Mussolini bit his weenie.
[03:49:49.795 --> 03:49:50.856]  Now it doesn't work.
[03:49:51.036 --> 03:49:51.316]  Yeah.
[03:49:52.057 --> 03:49:54.959]  Maybe you could get it to work again, Nancy.
[03:49:57.844 --> 03:50:04.628]  She also made the claim that the demonstrations were linked to Russia and called for the FBI to investigate.
[03:50:05.589 --> 03:50:05.849]  Yeah.
[03:50:08.811 --> 03:50:09.231]  The FBI?
[03:50:09.291 --> 03:50:10.312]  How about the SS?
[03:50:11.293 --> 03:50:13.194]  How about the SS to investigate?
[03:50:13.494 --> 03:50:15.255]  And we don't need an FBI.
[03:50:17.516 --> 03:50:19.137]  We don't need an FBI.
[03:50:19.438 --> 03:50:20.558]  Or maybe they're gonna come after me.
[03:50:20.618 --> 03:50:24.441]  I'm getting emails, by the way, warning me that they're coming after me, so.
[03:50:25.205 --> 03:50:25.965]  Just to let you know.
[03:50:26.406 --> 03:50:28.227]  So, we could use the support.
[03:50:31.348 --> 03:50:34.030]  Some of these protesters are spontaneous and organic.
[03:50:34.730 --> 03:50:37.771]  Some think it... I think are connected to Russia.
[03:50:39.312 --> 03:50:44.415]  And I have been... And I've been looking at this for a long time, you know.
[03:50:44.515 --> 03:50:45.395]  Oh, you've been looking at it?
[03:50:46.116 --> 03:50:48.037]  How about you've been looking up your you-know-what?
[03:50:48.797 --> 03:50:50.498]  And that's all you see is crap.
[03:50:50.577 --> 03:50:52.417]  Because that's what's spewing out of your mouth.
[03:50:52.417 --> 03:50:55.716]  Yep.
[03:50:55.716 --> 03:51:04.577]   Recent poll from YouGov found that half the people who voted for President Biden in 2020
[03:51:04.577 --> 03:51:07.858]  believe Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.
[03:51:08.136 --> 03:51:10.796]  And I didn't vote for Biden, I haven't voted since Ron Paul.
[03:51:11.556 --> 03:51:13.697]  And it is genocide by the definition.
[03:51:14.217 --> 03:51:14.697]  Look it up.
[03:51:18.178 --> 03:51:23.880]  And again, we cover the world in the Trends Journal.
[03:51:24.420 --> 03:51:27.581]  And there's an article that just came out, UK poverty deepens.
[03:51:28.536 --> 03:51:29.897]  Yeah, UK poverty deepens.
[03:51:30.998 --> 03:51:39.365]  And, and then you're reading about all these these crash, you know, and people stealing stuff all the time running and all the businesses closing down.
[03:51:40.406 --> 03:51:42.528]  None of this existed before the COVID war.
[03:51:44.129 --> 03:51:48.513]  The mental disorders, physical, mental, spiritual.
[03:51:49.454 --> 03:51:54.618]  And then it goes back again, you take the global view, I mentioned, oil prices are down.
[03:51:55.895 --> 03:51:58.676]  Evergrande over there in China.
[03:51:58.916 --> 03:52:00.817]  Yeah, they're having a happy time bankrupt.
[03:52:00.857 --> 03:52:01.457]  Yeah, that one.
[03:52:02.617 --> 03:52:09.960]  They had a housing boom that was going to bust anyway, but then three years of zero COVID policy destroyed their economy.
[03:52:11.380 --> 03:52:13.421]  Again, when all those fails, they take you to war.
[03:52:13.781 --> 03:52:16.062]  So watch for the Taiwan thing to ramp up.
[03:52:16.482 --> 03:52:21.783]  But going back to this, the damage of the COVID war is incalculable.
[03:52:22.844 --> 03:52:23.424]  That it's done.
[03:52:25.475 --> 03:52:30.659]  It's destroyed the lives and livelihoods of billions of people across the planet.
[03:52:32.461 --> 03:52:37.786]  Every, it's changed because one of our top trends and we don't have a lot of time to go into it.
[03:52:37.826 --> 03:52:38.266]  No time.
[03:52:39.707 --> 03:52:41.989]  The banks, there's going to be a banking bust this year.
[03:52:44.371 --> 03:52:48.215]  Your office occupancy rate is occupancy rate is 50% vacancy rate.
[03:52:48.255 --> 03:52:48.215]  20%.
[03:52:48.074 --> 03:52:51.234]  percent vacancy rate, 20 percent.
[03:52:51.234 --> 03:52:56.114]  Got to pay that mortgage you got on that loan.
[03:52:56.451 --> 03:52:57.171]  Not going to pay it.
[03:52:58.372 --> 03:52:59.893]  Again, gold prices going up.
[03:53:00.673 --> 03:53:01.554]  Markets going up.
[03:53:02.114 --> 03:53:02.674]  What's next?
[03:53:02.774 --> 03:53:03.315]  What to do?
[03:53:04.956 --> 03:53:12.400]  Go to jonestrends.com and subscribe to the Trends Journal and you'll see what to do to prevail and prosper in these dangerous times ahead.
[03:53:12.800 --> 03:53:16.162]  And don't forget, do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[03:53:16.562 --> 03:53:18.103]  They got a great crew over there.
[03:53:18.123 --> 03:53:21.125]  They work tirelessly to give you the best that they can give you.
[03:53:21.625 --> 03:53:23.506]  So thanks for tuning in and see you next week.
[03:53:26.028 --> 03:53:30.749]  Two years ago, we began developing this game that came out so much better than I even thought it would.
[03:53:30.769 --> 03:53:32.029]  It is now a number one hit.
[03:53:32.489 --> 03:53:35.910]  I imagined the control freak left attacking it.
[03:53:36.450 --> 03:53:49.493]  But I didn't know that right when the game came out, with perfect timing, Elon Musk would release me on X. And the whole world will be waking up, and the Davos Group will be confronted at their own events by world leaders calling out their tyranny.
[03:53:49.913 --> 03:53:51.334]  This is the planets aligning.
[03:53:51.734 --> 03:53:58.519]  And now, MSNBC, the corporate press, Media Matters, George Soros, they're all calling for it to be banned.
[03:53:58.779 --> 03:54:07.825]  Is there a way to counter the types of hate that people like Alex Jones promote and now they do in video games?
[03:54:07.885 --> 03:54:13.329]  I mean, this is a party that talks about video games being dangerous for our kids.
[03:54:13.589 --> 03:54:17.812]  And yet here he is with a video game that promotes violence.
[03:54:18.392 --> 03:54:19.293]  You will be silenced.
[03:54:20.756 --> 03:54:22.843]  And celebrates that kind of violence.
[03:54:24.113 --> 03:54:26.334]  You suck, big tech lizard nerd!
[03:54:26.554 --> 03:54:34.718]  Because, let's be honest here, when he is talking about killing globalists, we know what globalists now means for the Republican Party and what that is code for.
[03:54:35.058 --> 03:54:40.560]  Because they understand they're reaching a bunch of young guys who are getting this sort of message beaten into them right now.
[03:54:40.860 --> 03:54:43.601]  Today, I'm playing the Unhinged Alex Jones video game.
[03:54:43.921 --> 03:54:47.723]  I saw it was released on Steam, so I'm like, well, that kind of opens the floodgates.
[03:54:47.963 --> 03:54:49.444]  This game is actually really good fun.
[03:54:50.064 --> 03:54:52.507]  This is insane!
[03:54:52.667 --> 03:54:54.870]  Look at all the blood!
[03:54:55.551 --> 03:54:59.074]  Look at all these zombies!
[03:54:59.715 --> 03:55:00.136]  Okay.
[03:55:00.216 --> 03:55:01.117]  I'll eat your ass!
[03:55:01.617 --> 03:55:02.799]  Okay, so that is what he said.
[03:55:04.080 --> 03:55:04.821]  I'll eat your ass!
[03:55:04.941 --> 03:55:11.526]  I don't know what the characteristics of the game are beyond that he's involved and that it's killing globalists.
[03:55:12.006 --> 03:55:21.213]  This is the kind of thing that will become a normalization lever in teaching people, I mean, it's okay to kill the globalists.
[03:55:21.413 --> 03:55:22.294]  This is pretty amazing.
[03:55:24.255 --> 03:55:26.797]  Jump around, jump around.
[03:55:27.197 --> 03:55:28.978]  Alex Jones, you are a hero.
[03:55:31.821 --> 03:55:33.422]  This is supposed to be Justin Trudeau, I think.
[03:55:34.929 --> 03:55:36.850]  Come on, Mark!
[03:55:37.191 --> 03:55:37.491]  Oh, sh**!
[03:55:38.371 --> 03:55:39.933]  Mark Zuckerberg, kill me!
[03:55:39.953 --> 03:55:41.033]  Forget him crawling away.
[03:55:41.594 --> 03:55:41.894]  Wait!
[03:55:43.115 --> 03:55:43.895]  What them dogs gonna do?
[03:55:43.915 --> 03:55:46.937]  They gotta... Oh, they ate his ass!
[03:55:47.218 --> 03:55:53.922]  Find out what they're scared of at alexjonesgame.com Follow the link from there to Steam and download it and share it.
[03:55:54.162 --> 03:55:54.763]  It's 1776.
[03:55:54.923 --> 03:55:56.724]  It funds the info war.
[03:55:57.064 --> 03:55:58.505]  It is key in the culture war.
[03:55:58.766 --> 03:56:03.389]  We need to be engaged and involved in books and films and universities.
[03:56:03.709 --> 03:56:04.530]  And Hollywood!
[03:56:04.650 --> 03:56:05.531]  And everywhere!
[03:56:05.771 --> 03:56:06.672]  And we are!
[03:56:07.012 --> 03:56:11.636]  So get Alex Jones' New World Order Wars right now before they ban it!
[03:56:11.937 --> 03:56:16.461]  Make it such a big hit, they continue to s*** their f***ing pants!
[03:56:16.761 --> 03:56:20.885]  And all the control freaks, I want to echo what Elon Musk said to your censorship.
[03:56:21.165 --> 03:56:22.806]  Go f*** yourselves!
