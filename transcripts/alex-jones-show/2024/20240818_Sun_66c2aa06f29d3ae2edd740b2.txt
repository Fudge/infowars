[00:00:01.252 --> 00:00:03.514]  It's Sunday, August 18th, 2024.
[00:00:04.374 --> 00:00:10.878]  I'm about to play you a clip of what Michael Morris said about Trump, but he still works against him.
[00:00:14.141 --> 00:00:18.323]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:20.905 --> 00:00:29.851]  Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives and said,
[00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:43.052]  If you close these factories, as you're planning to do in Detroit, and build them in Mexico, I'm going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back, and nobody's going to buy them.
[00:00:44.513 --> 00:00:45.833]  It was an amazing thing to see.
[00:00:46.854 --> 00:00:53.798]  No politician, Republican or Democrat, had ever said anything like that to these executives.
[00:00:54.298 --> 00:00:59.822]  And it was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania.
[00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:04.800]  He's saying the things to people who are hurting.
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:14.602]  And it's why every beaten down, nameless, forgotten, working stiff, who used to be part of what was called the middle class, loves Trump.
[00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:20.663]  He is the human Molotov cocktail that they've been waiting for.
[00:01:20.683 --> 00:01:26.764]  The human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them.
[00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:29.425]  Although they've lost their jobs,
[00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:32.456]  Although they've been foreclosed on by the bank.
[00:01:33.316 --> 00:01:36.198]  Next came the divorce and now the wife and kids are gone.
[00:01:36.238 --> 00:01:37.319]  The car's been repoed.
[00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:39.680]  They haven't had a real vacation in years.
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.523]  They're stuck with a shitty Obamacare bronze plan where you can't even get a fucking Percocet.
[00:01:47.264 --> 00:01:50.445]  They've essentially lost everything they had.
[00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:53.407]  Except one thing.
[00:01:55.028 --> 00:01:57.289]  The one thing that doesn't cost them a cent
[00:01:58.115 --> 00:02:02.999]  And it's guaranteed to them by the American Constitution, the right to vote.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.261]  They might be penniless.
[00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:07.482]  They might be homeless.
[00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:09.663]  They might be fucked over and fucked up.
[00:02:09.924 --> 00:02:10.644]  It doesn't matter.
[00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:14.027]  Because it's equalized on that day.
[00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:19.771]  A millionaire has the same number of votes as the person without a job.
[00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:20.731]  One.
[00:02:21.712 --> 00:02:26.756]  And there's more of the former middle class than there are in the millionaire class.
[00:02:27.955 --> 00:02:47.900]  The dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, he handed a ballot, closed the curtain, and take that lever, or felt pen or touchscreen, and put a big fucking X in the box by the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives.
[00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:52.161]  Donald J. Trump.
[00:02:54.705 --> 00:02:58.646]  They see that the elites who ruined their lives hate Trump.
[00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:02.808]  Corporate America hates Trump.
[00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:03.888]  Wall Street hates Trump.
[00:03:04.508 --> 00:03:06.289]  The career politicians hate Trump.
[00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:08.569]  The media hates Trump.
[00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.472]  Trump's election is going to be the biggest fuck you ever recorded in human history.
[00:03:18.936 --> 00:03:23.379]  And that was Michael Moore eight years ago, right before Trump getting elected.
[00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.561]  And then Michael Moore, of course, has fought like the devil to stop him.
[00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:32.544]  And that was Michael Moore talking to Democrats, explaining to them the problem.
[00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:39.629]  How many days are we to the election?
[00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.629]  78.
[00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.972]  78 days, 7 hours, 56 minutes, 24 seconds.
[00:03:44.872 --> 00:03:47.134]  And the Democrats have pledged civil unrest.
[00:03:48.217 --> 00:03:50.280]  That they will not accept Trump if he wins.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.202]  They said they'll have a civil war.
[00:03:52.242 --> 00:03:54.345]  We played those clips the last two weeks over and over again.
[00:03:54.365 --> 00:04:04.018]  And now, Joaquin Jeffries has come out, the Democrat leader, and said that they don't think Trump's going to accept losing.
[00:04:05.967 --> 00:04:12.132]  This is a very, very serious time to be alive, and I am, again, particularly prepared for Sunday night broadcast here.
[00:04:12.172 --> 00:04:15.935]  We've got so much powerful news and information to cover.
[00:04:17.096 --> 00:04:26.723]  I knew that Tim Walz was an admitted socialist and communist and had the military, the State Guard and National Guard stand down in the summer of rage.
[00:04:27.924 --> 00:04:32.128]  And I knew that he did dozens and dozens, over 25 trips to China and basically lived there.
[00:04:32.907 --> 00:04:36.650]  I knew he was stolen valor, and I knew he was procrastinating little boys.
[00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:45.916]  But now all the documents and news articles have come out from the time the man was recruited by the Communist Chinese and is a Communist Chinese agent.
[00:04:46.777 --> 00:04:47.718]  Of course, look at Hunter Biden.
[00:04:47.758 --> 00:04:48.638]  Look at Joe Biden.
[00:04:48.658 --> 00:04:51.240]  Look at half the Democrat Party in the Congress.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.662]  But he is a CHICOM actual agent.
[00:04:57.925 --> 00:04:59.266]  It is Sunday, August 18th, 2024.
[00:05:01.696 --> 00:05:02.697]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.737 --> 00:05:07.842]  We are live at 406 Central Standard Time, coming to you from Austin, Texas.
[00:05:07.882 --> 00:05:20.174]  Simulcast on talk radio, TV, cable stations, Infowars.com, Ford slash show, Band on video, and of course, at Real Alex Jones on X. Thank you again for joining us this evening.
[00:05:21.235 --> 00:05:24.277]  I will be here for the next two hours live.
[00:05:24.938 --> 00:05:28.480]  And then Chase Geyser with Sunday Night Live does a superlative job.
[00:05:28.941 --> 00:05:34.124]  He'll be taking over and blitzing through clips, news reports, breaking news, and of course, your phone calls.
[00:05:34.224 --> 00:05:37.827]  I really enjoy tuning in Sunday night to Sunday Night Live with Chase Geyser.
[00:05:37.847 --> 00:05:39.288]  It's excellent, just like Harrison Smith.
[00:05:39.308 --> 00:05:40.709]  Weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:41.129]  Central.
[00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.412]  Owen Schroer, weekday afternoons, 3 p.m.
[00:05:44.632 --> 00:05:45.032]  Central.
[00:05:45.272 --> 00:05:46.333]  And of course, my own broadcast.
[00:05:46.353 --> 00:05:48.995]  I want to thank you for joining me for the weekday transmission, 11 a.m.
[00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:49.515]  to 3 p.m.
[00:05:49.555 --> 00:05:49.796]  Central.
[00:05:50.771 --> 00:05:51.151]  All right.
[00:05:54.233 --> 00:05:57.794]  Let me tell you what's coming up, and then I'm going to go right to the heart of why this is happening.
[00:05:59.575 --> 00:06:09.219]  We have Tim Walz, even more information on stolen valor, pushing to castrate children, take them away from their parents, little girls as well, sterilize them.
[00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:18.323]  But now the fact that he has the total signature and M.O., 100% a communist Chinese spy, and then you have his rhetoric and his actions,
[00:06:20.083 --> 00:06:27.288]  He's a globalist, and he fits in with, you know, hell, half the Democrats in Congress have admitted communist Chinese spies.
[00:06:27.308 --> 00:06:29.610]  This is just insane, but new videos have come out.
[00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:31.572]  This is very damning.
[00:06:31.612 --> 00:06:41.079]  In news articles, he was interviewed when he was in college, and then when he got out of college, leading large groups of Americans to be compromised in communist China.
[00:06:42.418 --> 00:06:44.620]  And he basically admits that he's been on their payroll.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.761]  They financially helped him.
[00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:48.023]  He is a communist Chinese spy.
[00:06:48.643 --> 00:06:51.826]  He was recruited out of a Confucian center in college.
[00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.629]  And of course, I told you about this decades ago.
[00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:56.010]  It broke big the last six years.
[00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:02.435]  And Trump banned the Confucian centers at more than 100 major universities.
[00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:06.579]  And we've gone and actually infiltrated them here at UT in Austin.
[00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:09.481]  And I mean, it is open Mao Zedong, take over America.
[00:07:10.482 --> 00:07:13.245]  Uh, communism, reeducation camps.
[00:07:13.405 --> 00:07:15.367]  I mean, we've got walls, his wife.
[00:07:16.388 --> 00:07:19.711]  Saying when they were burning down the city, she loved it and opened the window.
[00:07:19.771 --> 00:07:21.933]  She could smell the burning tires and thought it was wonderful.
[00:07:23.835 --> 00:07:26.237]  But then he was in charge of the governor in order to stand down.
[00:07:26.257 --> 00:07:28.099]  I mean, this is just incredible.
[00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:30.981]  And we have a student saying, Look, he told us that Mao was great.
[00:07:31.542 --> 00:07:34.845]  He supported killing people at Tiananmen Square.
[00:07:36.696 --> 00:07:41.878]  And he would hand out little red books to everybody and was a collector of Mao Tse Tung paraphernalia.
[00:07:41.898 --> 00:07:51.962]  And of course you have the leader of Canada, Trudeau, saying he admires Xi Jinping and communist basic dictatorship.
[00:07:53.243 --> 00:07:59.065]  You have a linen bust at WUF heads and then founders Klaus Schwab's office.
[00:07:59.605 --> 00:08:03.187]  He does interviews with a big bronze linen head behind him.
[00:08:04.722 --> 00:08:06.263]  I mean, these people mean business.
[00:08:07.685 --> 00:08:08.907]  And it confuses folks.
[00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:11.590]  They go, why do you have these ultra-rich, powerful people supporting communism?
[00:08:12.131 --> 00:08:15.395]  That's been the way it's been since it was developed.
[00:08:15.435 --> 00:08:17.017]  And I'm going to explain that.
[00:08:18.078 --> 00:08:18.719]  That's coming up.
[00:08:20.632 --> 00:08:29.996]  I'll do that at the start of the next hour, because that will take at least 30 minutes to do the deep dive, show all these new videos, the news articles that were positive about him.
[00:08:30.116 --> 00:08:31.316]  Oh, he loves communism.
[00:08:31.336 --> 00:08:34.858]  He takes college students there to teach him, you know, all about it.
[00:08:36.198 --> 00:08:39.980]  I mean, just crazy, crazy, crazy stuff.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.642]  But Trump came out and said Kamala Harris has gone full communist.
[00:08:44.662 --> 00:08:45.222]  We have the video.
[00:08:46.183 --> 00:08:49.364]  But that's like saying a great white shark went full shark.
[00:08:50.751 --> 00:08:51.551]  Always been a shark.
[00:08:53.773 --> 00:08:57.014]  Kamala espouses classical communist views and policies.
[00:08:58.435 --> 00:09:09.421]  Like seizing companies, seizing intellectual property, seizing patents, price fixing, extrajudicial prison sentences.
[00:09:10.482 --> 00:09:13.063]  I mean, the woman is a literal monster.
[00:09:13.524 --> 00:09:17.766]  And when she steals all of Trump's economic agenda now to try to make her make you forget
[00:09:19.002 --> 00:09:23.285]  The policy she was just espousing the last month that she's been pushing her whole adult life.
[00:09:25.727 --> 00:09:26.867]  She will never implement.
[00:09:28.108 --> 00:09:32.391]  The no tax on tips and $6000 child credits and all the rest of it.
[00:09:33.171 --> 00:09:37.254]  She will simply say that because she knows that her official economic policies.
[00:09:38.455 --> 00:09:47.041]  Put her in line, maybe even worse than Bernie Sanders, who, by the way, often on lived in Russia and got married in Moscow back when it was
[00:09:51.343 --> 00:09:52.723]  We got married in Communist China.
[00:09:54.544 --> 00:09:57.325]  I mean, this is serious, serious stuff.
[00:09:57.385 --> 00:09:59.625]  And Donald Trump on Twitter shared this image.
[00:10:02.546 --> 00:10:04.087]  Of course, it's not fake news.
[00:10:04.167 --> 00:10:05.187]  It's not even satire.
[00:10:05.227 --> 00:10:06.307]  It's just an artist's rendering.
[00:10:06.347 --> 00:10:14.910]  If they flew their real colors at the DNC coming up, it would be the red flag with the Communist hammer and sickle.
[00:10:16.007 --> 00:10:19.810]  And speaking of Chicago, Chicago prepares for protest arrest during D.N.C.
[00:10:20.351 --> 00:10:26.096]  They've put up giant barricades, multi-level, deep, giant pallets of bricks have been delivered again magically.
[00:10:26.116 --> 00:10:27.777]  We have all the video of that.
[00:10:27.797 --> 00:10:28.878]  It's like the summer of rage.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.160]  Can't make this up.
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.043]  Democrats are building a protective wall around their convention.
[00:10:36.092 --> 00:10:37.514]  We've got really the big news here.
[00:10:37.854 --> 00:10:39.857]  Governor Whitmer is a spokesperson for the Deep State.
[00:10:40.438 --> 00:10:42.380]  She's gone out and parroted Kamala Harris and others.
[00:10:42.821 --> 00:10:46.185]  Says she wants to give drivers licenses, free college, and free healthcare to illegals.
[00:10:46.565 --> 00:10:51.231]  Quote, resonates with Americans, even though in every major poll and study,
[00:10:52.245 --> 00:10:58.189]  Every study, over 80% of Americans don't want to give illegal aliens free tuition, free housing, free health care.
[00:10:58.589 --> 00:11:00.310]  But she says it resonates with you.
[00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.932]  Like, doesn't brain cancer resonate with you?
[00:11:03.672 --> 00:11:06.294]  Doesn't being a really horrible car wreck resonate with you?
[00:11:06.854 --> 00:11:09.296]  Of course, she's implying that it means you like it.
[00:11:09.796 --> 00:11:12.378]  But it does resonate in a disgusting way.
[00:11:14.099 --> 00:11:19.563]  And then you've got Kamala's new campaign slogan, Strength Through Joy.
[00:11:20.774 --> 00:11:25.236]  Is word for word the official Nazi Party slogan?
[00:11:26.016 --> 00:11:30.999]  Before he became the leader in 33, then it was Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Fuhrer.
[00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:33.540]  Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Fuhrer.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.281]  One people, one land, one leader.
[00:11:36.781 --> 00:11:40.103]  Before that, it was strength through joy.
[00:11:40.703 --> 00:11:42.364]  Now they're talking about strength through joy.
[00:11:42.444 --> 00:11:44.525]  I mean, the Twilight Zoneness of this
[00:11:45.532 --> 00:11:50.153]  And Biden giving weird speeches at night with buildings lit up red with soldiers behind him?
[00:11:50.313 --> 00:11:52.414]  I mean, this is not good stuff.
[00:11:53.754 --> 00:11:55.934]  Unless you want to live in North Korea or Nazi Germany.
[00:11:56.935 --> 00:11:59.295]  So, they're really doing it.
[00:12:00.115 --> 00:12:04.076]  This is really, really, really, really, really, really happening.
[00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:11.458]  So when we talk about a fascist totalitarian communist, it's all just different names, basically the same system, just implemented a little bit different.
[00:12:12.602 --> 00:12:18.324]  We put up the fascist colors here of red and black because that's what we're facing.
[00:12:18.844 --> 00:12:24.626]  It's fascism globally with the big banks, but then they put us individually under a communist-style system.
[00:12:25.067 --> 00:12:28.208]  But it's a merger of those two systems.
[00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:38.192]  If you read Carol Quigley and Zbigniew Brzezinski and other top globalists, they talk about their system being a merger of fascism and communism with a technocracy over it or a technocratic system.
[00:12:39.632 --> 00:12:40.432]  And that's what this is.
[00:12:40.452 --> 00:12:41.613]  So we'll get into all of that.
[00:12:42.853 --> 00:12:44.394]  We've got so much other news.
[00:12:44.454 --> 00:12:50.416]  You had an Air Force base shot up by men that jumped out and tried to kill the people in the guard shack.
[00:12:51.257 --> 00:12:52.457]  They returned fire back.
[00:12:53.398 --> 00:13:00.801]  We just had Naomi Wolf on breaking down the fact that there's huge standing armies of paramilitary men inside the United States stationed around military bases.
[00:13:01.341 --> 00:13:04.042]  She expected this stuff to start happening in probing attacks.
[00:13:05.643 --> 00:13:07.584]  This is just all part of turning the temperature up.
[00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:12.431]  So we're going to be looking at all of that coming up tonight.
[00:13:12.511 --> 00:13:15.753]  But you know, I said last fall with Tucker Carlson.
[00:13:16.854 --> 00:13:28.440]  That I predict the Democrats will weaponize violent far left groups prevent Trump from becoming the 47th president, and they would begin warming them up in the summer right through in to the DNC.
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.762]  And then if Trump becomes elected, they will totally burn the country down.
[00:13:31.782 --> 00:13:34.204]  The Democrats have said this in war games.
[00:13:34.264 --> 00:13:35.324]  I wasn't predicting this.
[00:13:36.485 --> 00:13:42.711]  John Podesta said four years ago in a New York Times article that they were gamed at the highest level Democratic Party of Trump won.
[00:13:43.172 --> 00:13:47.036]  They were not going to accept it and have their own inauguration and quote someplace like Colorado.
[00:13:47.856 --> 00:13:50.539]  They would just take control of the cities and basically have a civil war.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.663]  We played Jamie Raskin two weeks ago, saying that is their plan in this election.
[00:13:55.804 --> 00:13:58.007]  So let's just play this short.
[00:13:59.215 --> 00:14:04.303]  Little clip here and then I'm going to reset and go to the bottom of the rabbit hole.
[00:14:05.064 --> 00:14:11.092]  Why the system is doing this to understand why they're so ruthless, why they're so corrupt, why they're so so evil.
[00:14:11.112 --> 00:14:12.655]  But here's that clip from Tucker.
[00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:21.619]  Let's stop right there.
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:22.960]  Let's just stop right there.
[00:14:23.841 --> 00:14:26.522]  Um it's no big deal that that's that's the wrong clip.
[00:14:27.503 --> 00:14:30.365]  I had told you guys I wanted SP one and that's my fault.
[00:14:30.545 --> 00:14:35.187]  And then I kind of changed gears and I kind of gave me a foreshadowing that I wanted to play this clip.
[00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:37.389]  So let's take a few minutes overhead shot.
[00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:39.790]  I'll show you the clip was Tucker retweeted this last night.
[00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:41.931]  And so I thought it was important to play this.
[00:14:41.971 --> 00:14:43.032]  You see, you see this right here.
[00:14:43.712 --> 00:14:46.394]  And this is a one minute three second clip.
[00:14:47.666 --> 00:14:50.727]  And it is on the list, or I know I sent it to you.
[00:14:51.388 --> 00:14:52.348]  So we'll take some time.
[00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:55.989]  And we'll find that clip.
[00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.131]  Or if we don't have it, we will get it.
[00:15:00.131 --> 00:15:01.131]  And we'll just relax here.
[00:15:01.772 --> 00:15:02.632]  It's a good Sunday night.
[00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:03.852]  It's an enjoyable Sunday night.
[00:15:04.493 --> 00:15:08.074]  I reposted this on X, and I'd sent it, so I saw it in my stack.
[00:15:08.854 --> 00:15:09.815]  I figured we had this.
[00:15:09.855 --> 00:15:10.095]  But look.
[00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.369]  Great.
[00:15:11.409 --> 00:15:11.849]  Take your time.
[00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:12.189]  Enjoy.
[00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:13.130]  Here's the deal.
[00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.171]  I'm going to just relax here on the show these days.
[00:15:15.191 --> 00:15:16.331]  We're in such a serious time.
[00:15:17.152 --> 00:15:19.033]  I give the crew so many hundreds of things.
[00:15:19.073 --> 00:15:20.914]  They do a great job trying to organize it all.
[00:15:21.774 --> 00:15:23.215]  And we're going to play this clip.
[00:15:24.335 --> 00:15:31.719]  And then I'm going to give you the preface of the bottom of the rabbit hole and what we're really facing as a society.
[00:15:31.739 --> 00:15:38.262]  But since I was finishing up with the DNC before I get back into it more later, I wanted to just play the clip I was referencing.
[00:15:38.282 --> 00:15:38.582]  Here it is.
[00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:45.434]  We're winning the culture war, so they want to induce us into violence.
[00:15:45.514 --> 00:15:56.883]  And they've said they're introducing legislation, the Democratic Party in the House and Senate, to strip Trump of the Insurrection Act, which George Herbert Walker Bush used during the L.A.
[00:15:56.923 --> 00:15:57.283]  riots.
[00:15:57.703 --> 00:16:19.942]  and they're saying oh we know when he gets elected if he does there's gonna be huge uprisings and he's a white supremacist so we've got to drive him from office that way so they're planning to torch the country when he's president-elect before he's in and try to intimidate everyone so Black Lives Matter and Antifa and all of this Hezbollah Hamas protests and again I'm not against I'm
[00:16:20.422 --> 00:16:20.562]  Okay.
[00:16:51.104 --> 00:16:51.344]  So.
[00:16:52.986 --> 00:16:54.046]  Getting back to where I was.
[00:16:55.187 --> 00:16:56.608]  This is all a communist playbook.
[00:16:57.709 --> 00:17:00.211]  And they're implementing it, and they're saying, and now they're reporting 100,000.
[00:17:02.513 --> 00:17:11.800]  The Chicago Tribune AP, they're all reporting 100,000 Black Lives Matter Palestinian protesters are going to hit Chicago.
[00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:19.907]  Starting tomorrow, we'll have live coverage, obviously, day and night here at Infowars.com and at RealAlexJones on X.
[00:17:22.452 --> 00:17:34.442]  Before I drill into what I mentioned in greater detail and actually play you clips of the things I just talked about, like Whitmer saying, give drivers license so they can vote, free college, free health care and illegals resonates with the public and all the rest of this.
[00:17:35.423 --> 00:17:42.029]  And then some of the new chilling clips of Kamala, uh, saying that she's not just going to price fixing.
[00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:48.394]  And she's no, no, she's going to seize any assets of any companies she wants.
[00:17:49.956 --> 00:17:50.076]  And
[00:17:52.614 --> 00:18:05.402]  She says that if you don't reach your quota of, say, hiring women, even though they're not, say, applying for oil-filled jobs, that they will put a giant fine on your company.
[00:18:05.422 --> 00:18:07.603]  So this is Communism 101.
[00:18:08.583 --> 00:18:14.687]  Destroy the economy, force everybody in the workforce to further destroy the infrastructure for having families.
[00:18:15.307 --> 00:18:16.328]  So that's all coming up.
[00:18:17.068 --> 00:18:19.190]  But I wanted to play this John Bowne report.
[00:18:20.154 --> 00:18:21.795]  It's called Fast Lane to Extinction.
[00:18:21.815 --> 00:18:24.257]  We're going to post it on X. It really needs to be seen.
[00:18:24.617 --> 00:18:26.199]  It just came out a few hours ago.
[00:18:26.219 --> 00:18:30.962]  And it just shows a few of the clips of globalists talking about depopulation.
[00:18:32.043 --> 00:18:36.987]  And the fact that world population just six months ago started dropping for the first time since the Black Plague.
[00:18:38.148 --> 00:18:41.850]  That live expectancy in the West is dropping.
[00:18:43.004 --> 00:18:47.308]  Cancer, every other serious disease is exploding off the charts.
[00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:49.771]  And it's not just the poison shots.
[00:18:49.831 --> 00:18:50.932]  It's the GMO.
[00:18:50.992 --> 00:18:51.573]  It's all of it.
[00:18:51.913 --> 00:18:52.654]  It's the 5G.
[00:18:52.694 --> 00:18:55.677]  This is a strategic plan for depopulation.
[00:18:55.697 --> 00:19:05.767]  So when you wonder why all these coordinated governments are doing things like cutting off fertilizer, cutting off fuel, cutting off energy, undermining the family, cutting the police, letting criminals run wild,
[00:19:06.408 --> 00:19:33.411]  It's all meant to destroy the old free market system that was monopolistic in ways and somewhat crony and corrupt and the globalists got fabulously rich off of it, but still there was a lot of diversity in the economy, a lot of upward mobility, and they can't centralize control and have a global cashless society and global social credit score if there's so much prosperity because people can go get another job outside of the corporate system or slash governmental system.
[00:19:34.051 --> 00:19:56.793]  But if you have artificial scarcity, and you have price fixing, and you have the breakdown of civilization, and you have the breakdown of food supplies, they believe they can come in via the Cloward and Piven strategy, which before the Cloward and Piven ever came up with that in the 60s, and the Democrats officially adopted the 70s policy, that's out of the Communist playbook to create this atmosphere to use scarcity and lack of food as a weapon.
[00:19:57.694 --> 00:19:58.835]  We have a clip of
[00:20:01.109 --> 00:20:02.169]  A lot of folks talking about this.
[00:20:02.209 --> 00:20:03.430]  President Trump talking about it.
[00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.210]  Michael Savage talking about it.
[00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.091]  And we're going to be getting those clips as well.
[00:20:08.151 --> 00:20:15.953]  But here is John Bowne's report on why they're doing this because they want depopulation.
[00:20:16.853 --> 00:20:17.233]  Here it is.
[00:20:25.416 --> 00:20:26.556]  Your kind is extinct.
[00:20:38.319 --> 00:20:39.280]  It will not last forever.
[00:20:41.602 --> 00:20:43.844]  You can escape from it whenever you choose.
[00:20:45.405 --> 00:20:46.466]  Everything depends on you.
[00:20:47.587 --> 00:20:52.151]  You reduced me to this.
[00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:53.592]  No, Winston.
[00:20:55.373 --> 00:20:56.734]  You reduced yourself to it.
[00:20:57.395 --> 00:21:06.703]  Again, I think that the biggest question maybe in economics and politics of the coming decades will be what to do with all these useless people.
[00:21:07.042 --> 00:21:10.444]  We are losing progress against our sustainable development goals.
[00:21:10.944 --> 00:21:15.186]  We have put billions of dollars towards those goals, and we're truly losing progress.
[00:21:15.526 --> 00:21:19.008]  Many cults reach a point where mass murder is inevitable.
[00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:19.649]  It's the cult.
[00:21:19.769 --> 00:21:20.969]  I mean, it's the cult of cults.
[00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:22.930]  It's the cult of truth.
[00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.972]  It is no different with the climate change cult.
[00:21:26.192 --> 00:21:30.094]  We have to phase out fossil fuels, because this is a crisis of burning fossil fuels.
[00:21:30.854 --> 00:21:43.701]  It's just quite amazing that someone that is in government, actually elected to the government of the United States of America, would propose that we eliminate all fossil fuels in 12 years.
[00:21:44.221 --> 00:21:53.466]  It would basically begin a process of cannibalization amongst the human species, because the food could not be delivered to the stores in the middle of the cities anymore.
[00:21:53.766 --> 00:22:03.517]  We now know that definitively at no point during the least the past 800,000 years has atmospheric CO2 been as high as it is today.
[00:22:03.838 --> 00:22:12.808]  The reason you chose 800,000 years ago is because for 200 million years before that it was greater than it is today.
[00:22:13.601 --> 00:22:16.423]  And I'm going to submit for the record... Yeah, but there weren't human beings.
[00:22:16.503 --> 00:22:18.125]  I mean, there was a different world, folks.
[00:22:18.205 --> 00:22:19.586]  We didn't have 7 billion people.
[00:22:19.606 --> 00:22:23.028]  So how did it get to 2,000 parts per million if we humans weren't here?
[00:22:23.289 --> 00:22:30.034]  Because there were all kinds of geologic events happening on Earth which spewed up... Did geology stop when we got on the planet?
[00:22:30.815 --> 00:22:39.762]  Mr. Chairman, I... So if we act together to safeguard our precious planet, the welfare of all our people will surely follow.
[00:22:41.587 --> 00:22:43.288]  The Earth does not belong to us.
[00:22:44.428 --> 00:22:46.148]  We belong to the Earth.
[00:22:46.568 --> 00:22:51.310]  They're Kim trailing with aluminum dioxide all over the world, killing the seeds, the plants, the trees, the insects dying.
[00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:55.911]  They've got the Hadron Collider, their own scientists, and they can blow the Earth up, the tests they're doing.
[00:22:56.671 --> 00:22:58.232]  They're the ones releasing GMO.
[00:22:58.292 --> 00:22:59.572]  They're the ones with the 5G.
[00:22:59.832 --> 00:23:02.253]  They're the ones saying cut down trees, carbon's bad.
[00:23:02.493 --> 00:23:04.934]  So everything he says is a giant lie, except
[00:23:05.965 --> 00:23:07.086]  We own the Earth, you don't.
[00:23:07.306 --> 00:23:07.887]  It's ours.
[00:23:08.087 --> 00:23:09.308]  We're the guardians of the Earth.
[00:23:09.928 --> 00:23:11.669]  He represents the Earth while he's killing it.
[00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.412]  It isn't merely a new coronavirus or a nuclear war.
[00:23:15.713 --> 00:23:19.936]  This overlooked research makes all of those issues meaningless.
[00:23:20.396 --> 00:23:35.128]  An alarming new study has found that between 1973 and 2011, sperm counts in Western males, men in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, dropped from an average of 99 million sperm per cubic centimeter
[00:23:35.808 --> 00:23:40.930]  The end of human procreation is right around the bend with a target date of 2045 if human fertility continues its race to the bottom.
[00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.232]  It's been a 59% decline in total sperm count over the 40 years of our study.
[00:23:44.252 --> 00:23:44.792]  If the pregnant woman
[00:24:03.198 --> 00:24:07.642]  is exposed to phthalates in early pregnancy.
[00:24:08.282 --> 00:24:16.449]  These phthalates can reduce fetal testosterone at a critical time for male genital sexual development.
[00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:18.971]  Number of children is declining everywhere.
[00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:23.955]  And in fact, the countries that start high, that start with a high number of children,
[00:24:24.648 --> 00:24:25.669]  are going down faster.
[00:24:26.009 --> 00:24:32.493]  Just mathematically, if you'd extended the line, it does hit zero in 2045.
[00:24:33.294 --> 00:24:35.796]  All the planning, all the beta testing is over.
[00:24:36.516 --> 00:24:38.478]  And now, the Great Reset is here.
[00:24:39.378 --> 00:24:40.019]  It's a future.
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.581]  And for 80 plus percent of us, we're not in it.
[00:24:44.302 --> 00:24:50.106]  Maintain humanity under 500 million in perpetual balance with nature.
[00:24:51.991 --> 00:25:02.660]  Like we're pets, like we're a dog or a cat we take care of, or like we're a museum piece where they cull the population from seven and a half billion down to five hundred million.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.842]  I wonder who the lucky people are that are gonna get to live.
[00:25:06.062 --> 00:25:10.606]  Humanity itself is slowly dying and barely anyone knows about it.
[00:25:10.886 --> 00:25:12.848]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:33.586]  Now, did you notice when their scientists are showing those graphs that it shows no fertility, zero fertility by 2045?
[00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:41.691]  When does Yuval Noah Harari and all these other globalists like Ray Kurzweil, and Kurzweil's been saying it for decades,
[00:25:42.731 --> 00:25:49.136]  That there'll be no fertility and no one having babies by 2047 is the year they use.
[00:25:49.176 --> 00:25:49.876]  That's the graph.
[00:25:50.076 --> 00:25:51.577]  I mean, everybody's getting sterilized.
[00:25:53.238 --> 00:25:55.740]  Most sperm's down 90-plus percent in every Western country.
[00:25:57.001 --> 00:25:59.042]  And it's the glyphosate in the food supply.
[00:25:59.203 --> 00:25:59.923]  It's a lot of things.
[00:25:59.983 --> 00:26:02.885]  It's the chemicals they chose to make the plastics with.
[00:26:02.925 --> 00:26:05.207]  They could choose other chemicals that don't do that, that don't hurt you.
[00:26:06.227 --> 00:26:10.731]  And just a little bit of those chemicals in utero makes a male fetus less male.
[00:26:11.636 --> 00:26:16.319]  So when they say it's in the water or they're born this way, they're not really a female.
[00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:21.742]  They're more of a humanoid, chemically castrated creature.
[00:26:22.422 --> 00:26:23.743]  But that's not fast enough.
[00:26:23.983 --> 00:26:35.010]  So for people that still have some fertility or to make sure they don't, they make it fashionable, give you puberty blockers or just cut the genitals off.
[00:26:37.503 --> 00:26:40.905]  And this is why all the big banks and the media and BlackRock are pushing it.
[00:26:40.945 --> 00:26:44.426]  And you have to understand that this is the main driver.
[00:26:44.446 --> 00:26:49.469]  And if you don't know who your enemy is, and if you don't know what their ideology is, you have no chance of beating them.
[00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:57.313]  And I know that's really horrifying to admit to yourself this is going on, but if you just read their own literature, they sit around and brag about this.
[00:26:59.373 --> 00:27:00.254]  Now there's the CDC.
[00:27:00.434 --> 00:27:00.514]  U.S.
[00:27:00.534 --> 00:27:03.135]  fertility rate drops to another historic low in 2024.
[00:27:05.347 --> 00:27:06.928]  And our life expectancy is dropping.
[00:27:06.989 --> 00:27:08.350]  We're being murdered.
[00:27:10.011 --> 00:27:12.814]  It's all globally planned, all being rolled out.
[00:27:13.786 --> 00:27:22.554]  King Charles and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab are literally the generals running these attacks.
[00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:23.855]  All right, I'm going to shift out of this.
[00:27:23.915 --> 00:27:27.678]  Wanted to remind you what the master plan is and why they're trying to wreck everything.
[00:27:28.159 --> 00:27:35.065]  Because it's an admitted plan to build a post-human world and the tiny group that survives will then merge with machines and become gods that they believe.
[00:27:40.313 --> 00:28:02.947]  So whether you're in Australia, or whether you're in the UK, or whether you're in the US, or whether you're in Italy, or Germany, or France, just millions and millions of illegal aliens arrive every year, and they're given free housing, healthcare, 80 plus percent of the rapes are committed by them, 80 plus percent, look it up, never even get a job.
[00:28:03.467 --> 00:28:06.829]  After a decade, they just stand around in gangs.
[00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:09.191]  The vast majority are men,
[00:28:11.315 --> 00:28:25.298]  And then if people get upset about it, like in the UK, they put you in prison for 10 months, 15 months, 22 months, 2 years, for saying, these people are committing the most of the crime, I want them deported.
[00:28:26.659 --> 00:28:28.679]  Statements like that will get you 22 months in the UK.
[00:28:29.379 --> 00:28:31.700]  The UK is literally like North Korea now.
[00:28:32.967 --> 00:28:34.148]  I've been there probably 10 times.
[00:28:34.668 --> 00:28:37.269]  Amazing country, but basically ruined in most areas now.
[00:28:37.709 --> 00:28:38.550]  And I can't go there.
[00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:39.890]  Obviously, they'll arrest me, probably.
[00:28:40.451 --> 00:28:43.312]  They're saying they're going to arrest any Americans that criticize the government.
[00:28:43.892 --> 00:28:45.233]  The government is a pure tyranny.
[00:28:47.294 --> 00:28:51.076]  And Tim Walz supports banning people's free speech.
[00:28:52.476 --> 00:28:54.297]  And Kamala Harris supports doing it.
[00:28:54.397 --> 00:28:57.198]  And if they get into power, they're going to try all of this here.
[00:28:57.218 --> 00:28:58.059]  They've already been doing it.
[00:28:59.485 --> 00:29:07.047]  And look at the lawfare, look at the surveillance, look at the censorship, look at the debanking they've already done to people that don't get in line.
[00:29:07.127 --> 00:29:12.768]  That is pure totalitarianism carried out through the government and the corporations.
[00:29:14.488 --> 00:29:25.851]  And imagine the West, all the Western nations combined, only have about 700 million people maximum in them.
[00:29:26.741 --> 00:29:30.842]  And of that 700 million, 500 million are white.
[00:29:32.223 --> 00:29:36.064]  And the left makes it all bad that countries with white people even exist.
[00:29:36.584 --> 00:29:37.425]  They make it racial.
[00:29:38.145 --> 00:29:38.925]  You see it everywhere.
[00:29:39.805 --> 00:29:42.906]  Democratic parties on CNN, MSNBC saying whites are the problem.
[00:29:43.266 --> 00:29:44.167]  Whites are inherently evil.
[00:29:45.407 --> 00:29:50.189]  And it's the big banks, the big foundations, the intelligence agencies, the media pushing all this.
[00:29:50.209 --> 00:29:50.709]  So you've got
[00:29:53.134 --> 00:29:56.756]  Western nations with this tiny amount of white people.
[00:29:58.117 --> 00:30:00.539]  And the world is 8.5 billion people.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.762]  And white people are only 7% of that.
[00:30:07.223 --> 00:30:07.924]  In the whole world.
[00:30:08.984 --> 00:30:12.407]  And then we're being told on the news that we're the bad guys.
[00:30:13.828 --> 00:30:21.813]  And the corporate system is setting it up where if white people don't do whatever they're told politically, they're going to be called Nazis or racist and will be penalized.
[00:30:23.032 --> 00:30:25.473]  And then Kamala Harris put out campaign job ads.
[00:30:26.793 --> 00:30:29.794]  And basically said, if you're a white, straight male, you need not apply.
[00:30:30.274 --> 00:30:35.556]  Just like all these universities and corporations, we can play you IBM in their own hiring ads.
[00:30:39.537 --> 00:30:42.918]  Kamala Harris saying, if you don't hire the way we say, we'll fine your companies.
[00:30:45.259 --> 00:30:51.181]  Because the West generated a stairway to wealth and success.
[00:30:52.827 --> 00:30:54.548]  And the globalists don't want wealth and success.
[00:30:54.568 --> 00:30:57.049]  They want a giant group of poor, dependent people.
[00:30:57.089 --> 00:31:13.695]  So communism, totalitarianism, and all its flavors, the globalist technocracy, can't be sold, can't be accepted, if there is an alternative to it.
[00:31:17.457 --> 00:31:22.299]  And that's why they have to get rid of it.
[00:31:23.499 --> 00:31:25.682]  And I know most of the viewers and listeners understand this.
[00:31:25.702 --> 00:31:28.365]  Some of you probably understood before I was born, 50 years ago.
[00:31:29.126 --> 00:31:33.972]  So I'm not up here saying something that's not known, except you know it, I know it.
[00:31:34.673 --> 00:31:41.922]  Maybe 20-30% of the public in the world understands how this works, but we've got to wake up the rest of the people, because where we're being taken is very nightmarish.
[00:31:46.531 --> 00:32:00.642]  And again, they're using the non-white populations worldwide to teach them communism, but because whether you're in India or whether you're in Latin America or whether you're, you know, people don't tend to buy into communism.
[00:32:01.723 --> 00:32:02.624]  They know it doesn't work.
[00:32:02.724 --> 00:32:04.385]  It works for the globalists, but not for the general public.
[00:32:05.046 --> 00:32:05.686]  So instead,
[00:32:06.874 --> 00:32:14.416]  They found the 60s, 70s, and 80s, the Communist Party did here in America, this is on record, that they couldn't get black people particularly to become communist very, very often.
[00:32:14.976 --> 00:32:28.880]  But if they made it racially based instead of class envy to accept communism, if they tied communist policies to racial issues, they could get a better percentage, still not a majority, of black folks to sign on.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:33.561]  And then separately, they can use white guilt and bullying whites through the corporate media
[00:32:34.611 --> 00:32:44.114]  If they don't get on board with globalist policies, communist policies, totalitarian policies, then they get lectured and told how bad and how evil they are.
[00:32:47.535 --> 00:32:49.315]  And so, that's how this works.
[00:32:51.316 --> 00:32:53.736]  And it's very cold-blooded.
[00:32:55.757 --> 00:32:57.637]  The system knows exactly what it's doing.
[00:32:58.778 --> 00:33:03.739]  And that's really my greatest frustration, is it should be very easy to beat these people.
[00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:11.957]  When they're on record saying we're adding chemicals to the food and water supply, they're dumbing you down, giving you cancer, destroying your fertility.
[00:33:12.678 --> 00:33:13.979]  We're annihilating your energy.
[00:33:14.019 --> 00:33:15.201]  We're annihilating your future.
[00:33:15.241 --> 00:33:16.502]  We're annihilating your jobs.
[00:33:16.983 --> 00:33:19.105]  We're targeting poor people with massive taxes.
[00:33:20.126 --> 00:33:22.749]  We're trying to make life as hard as we can for you to make you give up.
[00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:30.372]  And then right when it's election time, they turn around and go, Oh, yeah, we're going to make gas prices low.
[00:33:30.792 --> 00:33:32.633]  We're going to make food prices low.
[00:33:33.293 --> 00:33:34.674]  We're going to give you all that, you know.
[00:33:35.174 --> 00:33:39.716]  And then, of course, with their policies, they're doing the exact opposite.
[00:33:42.377 --> 00:33:44.798]  Here's Governor Whitmer, who is really evil.
[00:33:45.979 --> 00:33:54.202]  I mean, just her face, she looks like a Disney witch villain, but her actions are just absolutely transparent.
[00:33:55.831 --> 00:33:57.412]  Some of the worst lockdowns in the country.
[00:33:57.852 --> 00:33:59.833]  Trying to stage a fake kidnapping of herself.
[00:34:00.814 --> 00:34:01.835]  Being against free speech.
[00:34:01.895 --> 00:34:02.895]  Being against due process.
[00:34:03.175 --> 00:34:05.037]  Helping steal the election from Trump in 2000.
[00:34:05.397 --> 00:34:06.738]  Supporting every globalist.
[00:34:07.498 --> 00:34:19.425]  Carbon tax and transgenderism and just the poison smorgasbord or witch's brew cauldron that is the New World Order agenda.
[00:34:20.586 --> 00:34:21.467]  That we're being forced feds.
[00:34:21.507 --> 00:34:21.887]  Here she is.
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:29.383]  Well, let me ask you about her running mate, Tim Walz, and particularly on the issue of immigration.
[00:34:29.463 --> 00:34:33.405]  Obviously, some of his policies in his state have come into focus.
[00:34:33.445 --> 00:34:48.233]  He signed into law initiatives allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for driver's licenses, quality for free tuition at public universities, and enroll in the state's free health care program for low-income residents.
[00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:52.815]  Would you like to see the Harris administration adopt those same policies, Governor?
[00:34:54.858 --> 00:34:57.440]  Well, I can tell you, you know, Tim Walz is a pragmatic guy.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:06.805]  He's a Midwesterner, just like me, and I think some of the wonderful things he's done in Minnesota resonate with, you know, Americans in all states.
[00:35:08.066 --> 00:35:10.588]  Yeah, Tim Walz said, you know, socialism is just being a good neighbor.
[00:35:10.828 --> 00:35:11.148]  No, it's not.
[00:35:11.168 --> 00:35:12.809]  It's taking your neighbor's property.
[00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:15.471]  And socialism is another name for communism.
[00:35:17.566 --> 00:35:21.387]  So, we see massive censorship of Trump ads.
[00:35:21.527 --> 00:35:24.288]  We see massive censorship of Trump speeches.
[00:35:24.328 --> 00:35:28.069]  We saw Google admitting they censored him being shot and the photos of it.
[00:35:28.489 --> 00:35:29.669]  And so that's just our policy.
[00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:31.810]  They tried to imply it didn't even happen.
[00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:34.731]  And then now, I've seen the trailer for it.
[00:35:35.151 --> 00:35:39.552]  I'm being sent a presser, you know, the film's in the mail right now by the producers of it.
[00:35:40.533 --> 00:35:42.113]  It starts rolling out in the next week.
[00:35:44.554 --> 00:35:45.474]  But the movie Reagan,
[00:35:46.954 --> 00:35:49.735]  Is coming out and they've been blocking it on Facebook.
[00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:54.917]  In other places, people sharing the trailer with Dennis Quaid.
[00:35:57.278 --> 00:35:58.218]  Saying it's political.
[00:35:58.318 --> 00:35:59.619]  Well, I mean, everything's political.
[00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:05.261]  So you have Disney and Hollywood and all these Obama movies that, you know, come out constantly right before elections.
[00:36:06.121 --> 00:36:08.762]  But but even a movie about Reagan.
[00:36:10.006 --> 00:36:10.746]  Is being censored.
[00:36:10.766 --> 00:36:13.927]  See, they're going to censor everything, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:14.527 --> 00:36:16.828]  So Dennis Quaid was here in Austin a few days ago.
[00:36:16.908 --> 00:36:19.289]  He went on Joe Rogan's show to talk about this.
[00:36:19.309 --> 00:36:22.250]  I've seen him on a lot of other shows in national news fighting back.
[00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:23.951]  I think this will backfire.
[00:36:24.591 --> 00:36:25.791]  And I've talked to folks who have seen the movie.
[00:36:25.811 --> 00:36:26.791]  They say it's very powerful.
[00:36:26.811 --> 00:36:27.832]  The trailer looks great.
[00:36:27.892 --> 00:36:30.953]  I'm a big Dennis Quaid fan, also a fan of his brother.
[00:36:31.893 --> 00:36:37.856]  But I said on X, I said, great move by Dennis Quaid going on the Joe Rogan experience to fight back against censorship.
[00:36:38.416 --> 00:36:40.917]  I'm definitely going to watch and promote the new Reagan film.
[00:36:41.397 --> 00:36:48.381]  Dennis Quaid says Facebook is banning the Reagan movie from advertising because it's anti-communism and could sway the American election.
[00:36:49.681 --> 00:36:53.263]  This should tell you all you need to know about the Democratic Party in America.
[00:36:54.266 --> 00:37:04.671]  So we're going to play Quaid talking to Rogan, then I'm going to play the trailer here, and then we're going to post the trailer with this intro with Rogan and myself talking about it on X Letter tonight.
[00:37:05.171 --> 00:37:09.553]  So be sure you promote it there, and keep posting it on Facebook and YouTube and everywhere else.
[00:37:10.053 --> 00:37:13.614]  You know, the answer to their censorship is just fight back, because a lot of it slips through the cracks.
[00:37:13.654 --> 00:37:16.836]  But again, this is communism they're bringing in.
[00:37:17.725 --> 00:37:19.085]  With globalists above it controlling it.
[00:37:19.566 --> 00:37:22.527]  It's a scientific technocracy, but they use communism as the model of control.
[00:37:23.007 --> 00:37:24.828]  China is what they're trying to bring here.
[00:37:25.168 --> 00:37:27.749]  The same technocracy, the same vaccine passports, all of it.
[00:37:28.569 --> 00:37:40.573]  And so I am really asking everybody, please, to understand that... And look, I know the general audience gets this, but there's still even Trump.
[00:37:40.593 --> 00:37:41.854]  I have a clip of him coming up.
[00:37:43.434 --> 00:37:45.835]  Trump says Kamala Harris has gone full communist.
[00:37:48.968 --> 00:37:58.898]  Well, yeah, you could say she was a baby Great White Shark 30 years ago, doing all the horrible things she did and persecuting innocent people and... your horrible police state record.
[00:38:00.268 --> 00:38:04.772]  But she was making communist statements 30 years ago and supporting totalitarianism 30 years ago.
[00:38:04.852 --> 00:38:07.394]  So, okay, she was a three-foot-long great white shark then.
[00:38:07.434 --> 00:38:08.595]  Now she's 20 feet long.
[00:38:09.216 --> 00:38:10.077]  Now she's Jaws.
[00:38:10.157 --> 00:38:18.584]  So, this idea that, oh, they're becoming communist, and I see all these talking points out of the Trump people about, oh, the left's idiots.
[00:38:19.205 --> 00:38:20.126]  They don't know that
[00:38:21.277 --> 00:38:23.079]  Price controls would wreck the economy.
[00:38:23.319 --> 00:38:26.662]  They didn't know cutting the Keystone Pipeline and killing all oil drilling would hurt it?
[00:38:27.383 --> 00:38:28.724]  And shutting down a bunch of other pipelines?
[00:38:28.744 --> 00:38:31.367]  They didn't know cutting off a bunch of fertilizer would hurt stuff?
[00:38:32.007 --> 00:38:36.492]  They didn't know all the lockdowns around the world would shut down the planet and cause the third world to collapse and flood us?
[00:38:36.872 --> 00:38:39.114]  They know damn well exactly what they're doing.
[00:38:39.975 --> 00:38:41.236]  And I've been on there 30 years.
[00:38:41.977 --> 00:38:43.318]  I've been listening to Rush Limbaugh for 40.
[00:38:45.236 --> 00:38:47.858]  And I love Rush, but he would always say they were idiots.
[00:38:47.898 --> 00:38:48.779]  They were wackos.
[00:38:48.819 --> 00:38:49.659]  They were nutjobs.
[00:38:49.919 --> 00:38:50.960]  Their followers are.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:39:03.609]  But let me tell you, the Rand Corporation and the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment and the Ford Foundation create the global policy and the intelligence agencies and media enforce it.
[00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:07.632]  I mean, they merged the WEF and the UN two years ago.
[00:39:08.352 --> 00:39:11.655]  They merged the Carnegie Endowment with the CIA three and a half years ago.
[00:39:12.335 --> 00:39:14.257]  The Carnegie Endowment runs the CIA.
[00:39:19.508 --> 00:39:27.157]  So that's where we are, and we've gotten Rockefeller Foundation documents, Carnegie documents, famous lawsuits we have and others have.
[00:39:27.217 --> 00:39:35.988]  I've had guests talk about it, and they're like, yeah, they're obsessed with InfoWars and stopping you because they say in these documents, and we've shown them, that InfoWars is exposing their infrastructure.
[00:39:37.068 --> 00:39:38.829]  Yeah, I mean, like, here's the Death Star plans, people.
[00:39:38.869 --> 00:39:39.590]  Here, it's all right here.
[00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:40.270]  They want to kill you.
[00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:42.552]  But they want to do it very slowly, so you don't know what hit you.
[00:39:42.972 --> 00:39:45.273]  And people are like, oh, yeah, that guy's a little radical.
[00:39:45.313 --> 00:39:45.894]  He's a little out there.
[00:39:46.154 --> 00:39:48.916]  They're attacking me because I have their number.
[00:39:49.416 --> 00:39:51.698]  And I'm not up here going, I have their number because I'm cool.
[00:39:51.938 --> 00:39:53.799]  I'm up here saying I have their number, so you're impressed.
[00:39:54.039 --> 00:39:55.220]  I'm risking my damn life here.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:55.940]  This isn't fun.
[00:39:56.901 --> 00:39:59.483]  But it's a lot better than laying down to these people.
[00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:02.371]  It's not like they're Boss Hog, you can make a deal with him.
[00:40:02.652 --> 00:40:04.453]  Look, if they were Boss Hog, I wouldn't fight him as hard.
[00:40:04.493 --> 00:40:12.518]  I wouldn't sell out to him, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't, you know, risk my life constantly and go head up against them if they just wanted to run things and skim off the top.
[00:40:13.339 --> 00:40:18.262]  We're not in good old boy, Boss Hog just wants to have the biggest house in the town.
[00:40:19.783 --> 00:40:21.324]  You got to tip your hat to Boss Hog.
[00:40:22.728 --> 00:40:24.870]  You can't leave the town because it's the whole damn world.
[00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:27.292]  If I lived in a town with Boss Hogg, I'd just leave.
[00:40:27.312 --> 00:40:29.554]  I'm not going to risk my life over Boss Hogg.
[00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:32.416]  Because Boss Hogg doesn't want to cut your son's genitals off.
[00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:34.558]  Boss Hogg doesn't want a nuclear war with the Russians.
[00:40:34.758 --> 00:40:39.402]  Boss Hogg ain't dumping chemicals in the water to make your son feminine.
[00:40:41.684 --> 00:40:43.085]  Boss Hogg doesn't want to kill you.
[00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:48.353]  He just wants to run you, and that's bad enough, because it always leads to this next thing.
[00:40:48.693 --> 00:40:55.757]  Scientists come in in the last hundred years and they go, why don't we just turn them all into animals and totally control them and get rid of most of them and get rid of this whole system?
[00:40:55.997 --> 00:40:58.839]  And then we'll have total scientific management and the end of war.
[00:40:59.039 --> 00:41:01.921]  That's the Carnegie Endowment 1920s plan.
[00:41:02.101 --> 00:41:03.102]  They said, how do we end war?
[00:41:03.122 --> 00:41:04.703]  And they said, you end humanity as we know it.
[00:41:06.496 --> 00:41:15.824]  And then they wage their war against us in the name of stopping it all and controlling the technology and, you know, they didn't just set up the UN to stop nuclear war, they set it up to end humanity as you know it.
[00:41:16.185 --> 00:41:27.615]  Their only way to stop war is to say we're bad, we're evil, they're scrapping us, they're getting rid of us, this was a bad plan, it's the end of Homo sapiens sapiens, as the WF officially says constantly.
[00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:34.132]  It is an anti-human, post-human, looking forward to the end of humans, Wall Street Journal, New York Times.
[00:41:34.312 --> 00:41:39.557]  I've been in the grocery stores and seen magazines at the checkout saying the world without humans would be great!
[00:41:39.998 --> 00:41:41.039]  It's all over the place!
[00:41:41.379 --> 00:41:42.400]  It's on Fox News!
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.222]  Don't have kids, they're bad for the Earth!
[00:41:44.482 --> 00:41:45.804]  It's a damn death cult!
[00:41:47.946 --> 00:41:50.648]  And cults always end in wanting total extermination.
[00:41:51.764 --> 00:41:52.725]  Of their competition.
[00:41:52.765 --> 00:41:54.267]  They want total power.
[00:41:54.307 --> 00:41:55.229]  The end of free will.
[00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.971]  God wants free will.
[00:41:57.011 --> 00:41:58.152]  God gives you all this freedom.
[00:41:58.853 --> 00:42:00.555]  They come in and give you the anti-freedom.
[00:42:01.016 --> 00:42:03.119]  Here's Joe Rogan and Dennis Quaid in the trailer for Reagan.
[00:42:04.758 --> 00:42:16.404]  We're kind of going through, uh, with Reagan right now, the movie, we're going through a, um, we're, we're being, uh, censorship is happening to us, uh, through Facebook.
[00:42:16.484 --> 00:42:22.367]  They, uh, Facebook banned advertising and, uh, a lot of the podcasts.
[00:42:22.407 --> 00:42:23.908]  This one will probably be banned.
[00:42:23.988 --> 00:42:24.508]  I don't know.
[00:42:36.252 --> 00:42:40.134]  I see it as, you know, it's a biopic is really what it is.
[00:42:40.154 --> 00:42:50.858]  It follows him from when he was a boy in Dixon all the way through when he said goodbye to the American people when he was diagnosed for Alzheimer's, you know, after he was president.
[00:42:51.539 --> 00:42:56.981]  And it's a fight against communism, you know, which he fought all of his life.
[00:42:57.822 --> 00:43:05.485]  But the reason being was that the content in it was an attempt to sway an election.
[00:43:07.745 --> 00:43:09.406]  A movie.
[00:43:09.466 --> 00:43:16.111]  I mean, the last time I heard, you know, Reagan was on the ballot 40 years ago was the last time.
[00:43:16.131 --> 00:43:19.654]  Do you think if you made a positive Obama movie, it would be to sway an election?
[00:43:19.714 --> 00:43:23.597]  Well, there was an Obama movie that came out during an election year in 2020.
[00:43:23.877 --> 00:43:26.619]  And, you know, nothing about that.
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:33.704]  And to me, I mean, just the act of banning or censoring that material,
[00:43:38.166 --> 00:43:40.267]  There's nothing a retired governor can do.
[00:43:40.548 --> 00:43:49.013]  But a president, now he can do a thing or two.
[00:43:50.254 --> 00:43:57.379]  I will be frank with you, that as a citizen, I would not like to see any political party outlawed on the basis of its ideology.
[00:43:57.679 --> 00:44:01.362]  Because I still believe, Mr. Chairman, that democracy can handle it.
[00:44:02.603 --> 00:44:04.544]  I was a brand new KGB officer.
[00:44:05.765 --> 00:44:10.587]  Given my first intelligence assignment, a certain actor and union leader.
[00:44:11.107 --> 00:44:13.147]  Dutch, there's a purpose for your life.
[00:44:14.528 --> 00:44:20.050]  You can run from a bully for so long, but after a while, you're gonna have to stand up to him.
[00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:22.790]  It's my boy!
[00:44:23.871 --> 00:44:26.552]  There's about to be another war right here in Hollywood.
[00:44:26.572 --> 00:44:28.812]  The commies on one side, the mob on the other.
[00:44:29.373 --> 00:44:30.593]  And you're right in the middle, son.
[00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:38.157]  If you put as much work into your career as you do making your speeches, you'd have an Oscar by now.
[00:44:39.879 --> 00:44:40.199]  Hello.
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:41.320]  I'm Nancy Davis.
[00:44:41.341 --> 00:44:42.242]  Hello, Nancy Davis.
[00:44:42.342 --> 00:44:43.082]  I'm Ron Reagan.
[00:44:43.583 --> 00:44:44.704]  I'm curious, Ron.
[00:44:44.804 --> 00:44:46.727]  What would you say is the issue of our time?
[00:44:47.007 --> 00:44:48.088]  No question about it.
[00:44:49.049 --> 00:44:50.951]  Communism and the Soviet Union.
[00:44:51.332 --> 00:44:51.993]  Get in the game.
[00:44:52.273 --> 00:44:52.974]  Run for office.
[00:44:54.821 --> 00:44:55.662]  It's you!
[00:44:55.762 --> 00:44:57.925]  I'm running for governor and I would like your vote.
[00:44:58.485 --> 00:44:59.366]  I forgot your name.
[00:44:59.426 --> 00:45:00.788]  Do his initials help?
[00:45:01.008 --> 00:45:01.088]  RR?
[00:45:01.208 --> 00:45:01.989]  Honey!
[00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:04.091]  Roy Rogers is here!
[00:45:04.412 --> 00:45:06.214]  And he's running for governor!
[00:45:06.934 --> 00:45:08.516]  Ronnie, remember when we met?
[00:45:08.556 --> 00:45:13.001]  You told me that you wanted to make a difference in this world.
[00:45:13.021 --> 00:45:13.882]  You know what you have to do.
[00:45:14.765 --> 00:45:18.548]  Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal.
[00:45:18.788 --> 00:45:19.789]  There you go again.
[00:45:19.809 --> 00:45:22.892]  But he was not afraid to take us on.
[00:45:22.932 --> 00:45:25.874]  There's nothing a retired governor can do about the Soviets.
[00:45:26.275 --> 00:45:29.277]  But a president, now he can do a thing or two.
[00:45:33.601 --> 00:45:36.323]  I was a lifeguard on a river.
[00:45:36.343 --> 00:45:41.787]  And I learned how to read the currents.
[00:45:44.671 --> 00:45:50.515]  Not just the ones on the surface, but also the ones deep underneath the water.
[00:45:55.199 --> 00:45:59.722]  I am about to start the biggest war of this century, and I'm not gonna fire a single shot.
[00:45:59.862 --> 00:46:01.643]  You're gonna blow up eight years of diplomacy.
[00:46:01.783 --> 00:46:05.186]  Well, if you think that got their undies they don't want, you just wait.
[00:46:05.406 --> 00:46:07.827]  What did the president know, and when did he know it?
[00:46:08.368 --> 00:46:09.929]  What would you have me do?
[00:46:10.149 --> 00:46:11.030]  I want you to fight!
[00:46:20.474 --> 00:46:27.757]  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!
[00:46:28.857 --> 00:46:34.019]  Coming out August 30th in theaters all over the place, but its premiere is coming in a few days in Los Angeles.
[00:46:35.139 --> 00:46:43.742]  And again, they are trying to stop them from being able to run ads on Facebook and other platforms, and they're taking down that trailer.
[00:46:45.403 --> 00:46:49.504]  A family-friendly film about Ronald Reagan.
[00:46:51.007 --> 00:46:52.668]  And that they say, because it's political.
[00:46:53.628 --> 00:46:57.530]  You see, Hollywood's controlled things, this country, for 70 years or longer.
[00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:59.431]  And they didn't have any competition.
[00:46:59.451 --> 00:47:09.355]  But now that filmmaking is much more affordable, and a lot of big stars, like Dennis Quaid, who I know folks that know him say he's a great patriot, anti-globalist.
[00:47:09.375 --> 00:47:10.176]  We know his brother is.
[00:47:10.996 --> 00:47:12.557]  And we know John Voigt and others are.
[00:47:13.749 --> 00:47:16.811]  They are so scared of this because they're scared of you having a voice.
[00:47:17.251 --> 00:47:21.393]  Now imagine that movie that I'm sure they'll call weird like J.D.
[00:47:21.413 --> 00:47:25.835]  Vance or Trump, with all the bizarre, crazy stuff they're doing.
[00:47:27.636 --> 00:47:34.359]  Trying to demoralize us and then saying, we're going to let illegal aliens vote, we're going to give everything free, and we think the American people support that.
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.100]  Look at this headline.
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:40.562]  New York City set to invest $10 billion in supporting illegal aliens.
[00:47:40.722 --> 00:47:42.063]  That was $5 billion last week.
[00:47:43.646 --> 00:47:49.348]  Kamala Harris is fast tracking citizenship applications in an attempt to reshape the electric.
[00:47:49.408 --> 00:47:50.288]  They admit that.
[00:47:52.729 --> 00:47:57.651]  Kamala Harris proposed price controls may lead to communism, mass starvation, end of America, zero hedge rights.
[00:47:57.891 --> 00:47:58.651]  That's the plan.
[00:48:01.332 --> 00:48:01.812]  Look at this.
[00:48:02.512 --> 00:48:06.614]  Kamala Harris for president requires all employees be up to date on COVID-19 vaccine status.
[00:48:09.622 --> 00:48:11.082]  Kamala Harris campaign is now hiring.
[00:48:11.603 --> 00:48:17.004]  Only if you've taken the clot shots, a whole bunch of them, and used Z, Zer, Who, Who, or pronouns.
[00:48:17.264 --> 00:48:18.624]  In other words, you have to be mentally ill.
[00:48:19.024 --> 00:48:19.745]  This is Nick Sordor.
[00:48:21.785 --> 00:48:32.968]  But strangely enough, even CNN, we'll play this clip in a moment, has hell frozen over, is condemning Kamala Harris' communist agenda.
[00:48:34.121 --> 00:48:37.324]  We've seen this kind of thing tried in lots of other countries before.
[00:48:38.025 --> 00:48:41.908]  Venezuela, Argentina, the Soviet Union, it leads to shortages and would cause a lot of harm.
[00:48:41.988 --> 00:48:42.949]  Why are they doing that?
[00:48:44.331 --> 00:48:45.772]  I've got my reasons for it.
[00:48:48.835 --> 00:48:50.496]  We've got more on the DNC coming up.
[00:48:50.536 --> 00:48:56.222]  They've got mobile abortion and vasectomy trucks.
[00:48:56.722 --> 00:48:58.304]  I'm not kidding, there's video of it.
[00:48:59.602 --> 00:49:05.926]  But first, I want to get into Tim Walz and his clear evidence that he's a communist Chinese agent, not just on their payroll.
[00:49:06.307 --> 00:49:07.207]  This guy's a spy.
[00:49:09.088 --> 00:49:24.079]  You think about Swallow's Well and Feinstein and all of them, I mean, it's just, it's, and what was on the laptop where Hunter's like, I work for the head of Chinese intelligence, and he's disappeared, and I don't know what to do.
[00:49:26.405 --> 00:49:28.467]  This is not a joking matter, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:28.487 --> 00:49:31.109]  This is not like, oh, we're calling them communists because that hurts them.
[00:49:31.149 --> 00:49:31.769]  No, they are.
[00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:34.991]  They are totalitarians using communist tactics.
[00:49:35.932 --> 00:49:36.993]  We're going to start the next hour.
[00:49:37.734 --> 00:49:41.216]  Please remember, we're not funded by the Politburo out of communist China.
[00:49:41.837 --> 00:49:43.598]  We're not funded by Bill Gates.

[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:49.883]  We're funded by the people watching and listening to this show here tonight.

[00:51:39.765 --> 00:51:41.566]  It just makes you feel relaxed and focused.
[00:51:41.926 --> 00:51:42.126]  We're good.
[00:51:42.146 --> 00:51:42.347]  We're good.
[00:51:42.367 --> 00:51:42.567]  We're good.
[00:51:42.587 --> 00:51:42.787]  We're good.
[00:51:42.807 --> 00:51:43.048]  We're good.
[00:51:43.068 --> 00:51:43.328]  We're good.
[00:51:43.348 --> 00:51:43.568]  We're good.
[00:51:43.588 --> 00:51:43.809]  We're good.
[00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:44.129]  We're good.
[00:51:44.189 --> 00:51:44.430]  We're good.
[00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:44.670]  We're good.
[00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:45.131]  We're good.
[00:51:45.231 --> 00:51:45.491]  We're good.
[00:51:45.511 --> 00:51:45.792]  We're good.
[00:51:45.812 --> 00:51:46.032]  We're good.
[00:51:46.052 --> 00:51:46.412]  We're good.
[00:51:46.432 --> 00:51:46.653]  We're good.
[00:51:46.673 --> 00:51:46.913]  We're good.
[00:51:46.933 --> 00:51:47.133]  We're good.
[00:51:47.154 --> 00:51:47.354]  We're good.
[00:51:47.374 --> 00:51:47.594]  We're good.
[00:51:47.654 --> 00:51:47.935]  We're good.
[00:51:47.955 --> 00:51:48.155]  We're good.
[00:51:48.175 --> 00:51:48.415]  We're good.
[00:51:48.435 --> 00:51:48.636]  We're good.
[00:51:48.936 --> 00:51:49.236]  We're good.
[00:51:49.277 --> 00:51:49.517]  We're good.
[00:51:49.537 --> 00:51:49.777]  We're good.
[00:51:49.797 --> 00:51:49.998]  We're good.
[00:51:50.018 --> 00:51:50.398]  We're good.
[00:51:50.418 --> 00:51:50.618]  We're good.
[00:51:51.079 --> 00:51:51.319]  We're good.
[00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:51.600]  We're good.
[00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:51.940]  We're good.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:52.161]  We're good.
[00:51:52.181 --> 00:51:52.501]  We're good.
[00:51:52.521 --> 00:51:52.721]  We're good.
[00:51:52.741 --> 00:51:52.962]  We're good.
[00:51:52.982 --> 00:51:53.222]  We're good.
[00:51:53.242 --> 00:51:53.462]  We're good.
[00:51:53.483 --> 00:51:53.683]  We're good.
[00:51:53.903 --> 00:51:54.103]  We're good.
[00:51:54.123 --> 00:51:54.444]  We're good.
[00:51:54.464 --> 00:51:54.824]  We're good.
[00:51:54.844 --> 00:51:55.105]  We're good.
[00:51:55.125 --> 00:51:55.345]  We're good.
[00:51:55.365 --> 00:51:55.586]  We're good.
[00:51:55.606 --> 00:51:55.846]  We're good.
[00:51:55.866 --> 00:51:56.106]  We're good.
[00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:56.447]  We're good.
[00:51:56.467 --> 00:51:56.667]  We're good.
[00:51:56.687 --> 00:51:56.887]  We're good.
[00:51:56.907 --> 00:51:57.108]  We're good.
[00:51:57.168 --> 00:51:57.388]  We're good.
[00:51:57.408 --> 00:51:57.608]  We're good.
[00:51:57.628 --> 00:51:58.029]  We're good.
[00:52:05.868 --> 00:52:21.557]  Just as new evidence showing DC police as the source of the January 6th pipe bombs gets released, and as the monumental crimes of the Biden family finally come to light, a new pandemic is announced by the WHO.
[00:52:22.017 --> 00:52:27.120]  Mpox has been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for more than a decade.
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:32.963]  And the number of cases reported each year has increased steadily over that period.
[00:52:34.264 --> 00:52:48.936]  Last year, reported cases increased significantly, and already the number of cases reported so far this year has exceeded last year's total, with more than 14,000 cases and 524 deaths.
[00:52:49.236 --> 00:53:00.124]  Today, the Emergency Committee met and advised me that, in its view, the situation constitutes a public emergency of international concern.
[00:53:01.385 --> 00:53:03.187]  I have accepted that advice.
[00:53:04.312 --> 00:53:08.676]  And once again, the WHO is saying we need contact tracing.
[00:53:09.216 --> 00:53:12.138]  So we need strong surveillance and good diagnostics.
[00:53:12.639 --> 00:53:26.190]  Our diagnostics teams are working to better understand the use of the current PCR tests, the other tests that exist that are out there, to distinguish between clade 1, clade 2, and we are looking at how we can get those vaccines, excuse me, those diagnostics into country.
[00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:34.676]  They are calling for PCR testing again, which we already know is ineffective and fraudulent when it comes to identifying a virus.
[00:53:35.076 --> 00:53:41.841]  Dr. Carey Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize for his invention of the polymer's chain reaction, the PCR.
[00:53:42.621 --> 00:53:47.262]  The PCR is a method of analysis and wasn't designed to test for a virus.
[00:53:47.922 --> 00:53:49.182]  Mullis explains why.
[00:53:49.482 --> 00:53:53.983]  And with PCR, if you do it well, you can find almost anything in anybody.
[00:53:54.343 --> 00:53:59.744]  It starts making you believe in the sort of Buddhist notion that everything is contained in everything else, right?
[00:53:59.764 --> 00:54:09.686]  I mean, because if you can amplify one single molecule up to something that you can really measure, which PCR can do, then there's just very few
[00:54:10.386 --> 00:54:13.568]  Molecules that you don't have at least one single one of them in your body, okay?
[00:54:13.869 --> 00:54:17.251]  So that could be thought of as a misuse of it just to claim that it's meaningful.
[00:54:18.131 --> 00:54:24.676]  The PCR test can potentially find anything you are looking for, depending on how high you turn it up.
[00:54:25.456 --> 00:54:27.278]  And this is exactly what has been done.
[00:54:27.938 --> 00:54:35.623]  The official protocol given for the PCR testing of COVID-19 created a floodgate of false positives to skew the results.
[00:54:36.584 --> 00:54:39.426]  They call it asymptomatic because it's a lie.
[00:54:40.366 --> 00:54:43.909]  These people don't have symptoms because they don't have COVID-19.
[00:54:44.849 --> 00:54:49.233]  They do it today because they've done it in the past and always gotten away with it.
[00:54:50.373 --> 00:54:57.919]  China announced on Friday that they will be screening people and goods entering the country for MPOCS over the next six months.
[00:54:58.909 --> 00:55:10.448]  In the 2024 New Zealand pandemic plan, under the special powers legislation, it states that authorized medical personnel have the power to force vaccinate people.
[00:55:11.813 --> 00:55:17.741]  And Google's former CEO, Eric Schmidt, is creating an AI army for robotic war.
[00:55:18.242 --> 00:55:20.665]  And what he first says will be defensive.
[00:55:21.566 --> 00:55:25.010]  And the idea basically is to do two things.
[00:55:25.451 --> 00:55:29.396]  Use AI in complicated, powerful ways for these essentially robotic war.
[00:55:30.177 --> 00:55:32.518]  And the second one is to lower the cost of the robots.
[00:55:33.118 --> 00:55:36.720]  Now you sit there and you go, why would a good liberal like me do that?
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:43.583]  And the answer is that the whole theory of armies is tanks, artilleries, and mortar.
[00:55:44.304 --> 00:55:45.845]  And we can eliminate all of them.
[00:55:46.585 --> 00:55:50.367]  And we can make the penalty for invading a country, at least by land,
[00:55:51.457 --> 00:55:52.557]  Essentially be impossible.
[00:55:52.938 --> 00:55:55.538]  But then admits they will be primarily offensive.
[00:55:55.898 --> 00:55:58.679]  Does it give more of an advantage to defense versus offense?
[00:55:58.719 --> 00:56:00.840]  Can you even make that distinction?
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:05.201]  Because I've been doing this for the last year, I've learned a lot about war that I really did not want to know.
[00:56:05.961 --> 00:56:14.044]  And one of the things to know about war is that the offense always has the advantage because you can always overwhelm the defensive systems.
[00:56:15.064 --> 00:56:21.949]  And so you're better off as a strategy of national defense to have a very strong offense that you can use if you need to.
[00:56:21.969 --> 00:56:25.411]  And the systems that I and others are building will do that.
[00:56:26.432 --> 00:56:30.755]  Because of the way the system works, I am now a licensed arms dealer.
[00:56:31.781 --> 00:56:37.806]  While the Uniparty vows to pit Americans against each other in a civil war to maintain its power.
[00:56:38.367 --> 00:56:41.209]  Bodyguards for everybody in civil war conditions.
[00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:47.374]  The big tech elitists are developing an offensive robot army and more clod shots.
[00:56:48.716 --> 00:56:51.338]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:57:00.436 --> 00:57:06.100]  All right, we're going to do a little bit of a dive on Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:08.482]  It's known as Stolen Valor.
[00:57:08.562 --> 00:57:11.985]  It's known that he supported the burning down of much of Minnesota.
[00:57:12.005 --> 00:57:16.929]  And we know he's an admitted communist, but he really is a communist Chinese agent.
[00:57:17.549 --> 00:57:19.029]  And the evidence is just pouring out.
[00:57:19.169 --> 00:57:20.090]  And when you know the M.O.
[00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:23.231]  of these people, he has the exact signature.
[00:57:23.271 --> 00:57:24.891]  It's incredible he had a security clearance.
[00:57:25.291 --> 00:57:26.131]  It's incredible he's in the U.S.
[00:57:26.151 --> 00:57:26.592]  military.
[00:57:26.632 --> 00:57:33.554]  But then you have General Milley, who supports the Confucian centers, and who would get on the phone and tell Xi Jinping, don't worry, I'm really the president.
[00:57:33.634 --> 00:57:38.475]  So, the upper ranks of the military, I mean, are completely full of these people.
[00:57:40.003 --> 00:57:45.407]  And that's how they're positioning for the takeover and our merger, basically, with Communist China.
[00:57:46.128 --> 00:57:50.651]  Now, China got too big for its britches 12 years ago and started not following globalist orders.
[00:57:51.332 --> 00:57:52.192]  And so the U.S.
[00:57:52.252 --> 00:57:54.734]  started putting some military around there, started putting some pressure on them.
[00:57:55.094 --> 00:57:57.276]  Trump put big pressure on them, started pulling us out of that.
[00:57:57.736 --> 00:57:59.418]  The government outlawed the Confucian centers.
[00:58:01.291 --> 00:58:03.953]  And so they rolled it back because China was muscling in.
[00:58:03.993 --> 00:58:08.596]  It was supposed to be a deal, a merger, like a marriage, not we're China's slaves.
[00:58:09.577 --> 00:58:12.419]  The people are slaves under it, but the globals had a partnership.
[00:58:12.779 --> 00:58:20.525]  And of course, just like Stalin and Hitler had a partnership two years into it, Hitler broke the deal and attacked Stalin because he thought Stalin was about to break the deal and attack him.
[00:58:20.545 --> 00:58:22.546]  And that's Operation Barbarossa, 1942, late 42.
[00:58:27.421 --> 00:58:29.021]  That's where we are with all of this.
[00:58:30.642 --> 00:58:33.042]  But there's so many of these operatives in our government.
[00:58:34.023 --> 00:58:37.043]  And it's just so crazy.
[00:58:38.224 --> 00:58:39.324]  With nearly all U.S.
[00:58:39.344 --> 00:58:43.285]  Confucius Institutes closed, some schools sought alternative language support.
[00:58:43.465 --> 00:58:43.965]  Oh, yes.
[00:58:45.025 --> 00:58:45.325]  Right.
[00:58:47.046 --> 00:58:48.206]  And that's how they're recruiting the youth.
[00:58:48.246 --> 00:58:49.787]  That's how they're getting them into these systems.
[00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:51.247]  Now,
[00:58:53.277 --> 00:58:56.358]  I want to play these clips before we go into Waltz because it shows what I'm talking about.
[00:58:57.038 --> 00:59:11.981]  First is CNN with an economist and financial reporter on, and she just very matter of factly gives you the MO on price controls, which always create havoc within a few months.
[00:59:13.101 --> 00:59:13.761]  Shortages.
[00:59:15.021 --> 00:59:15.522]  Hell on earth.
[00:59:16.522 --> 00:59:19.282]  But again, that's out of the playbook, and I'm not going to play the whole thing.
[00:59:19.322 --> 00:59:22.003]  I reposted on X. There's a 15-minute breakdown.
[00:59:23.667 --> 00:59:24.828]  Michael Savage on this.
[00:59:25.248 --> 00:59:31.250]  You know, he kind of gets to it in the first few minutes, so he's one of the few big talk show hosts that gets it.
[00:59:31.271 --> 00:59:32.571]  And I don't say that with pleasure.
[00:59:32.591 --> 00:59:40.195]  I mean, I like Michael Savage, but still, most of the other talk show hosts that are against communism are like, oh, they're so dumb.
[00:59:40.255 --> 00:59:40.935]  It doesn't work.
[00:59:40.995 --> 00:59:42.456]  Again, I know I keep harping on this.
[00:59:42.856 --> 00:59:43.836]  Yes, they know it works.
[00:59:43.896 --> 00:59:45.257]  It's how they took over half the damn planet.
[00:59:46.206 --> 00:59:46.486]  Okay?
[00:59:46.847 --> 00:59:48.168]  They want to make you poor.
[00:59:48.468 --> 00:59:49.689]  They want to make you dependent.
[00:59:49.749 --> 00:59:51.170]  They admit it in their own white papers.
[00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:53.772]  Cloward and Pippen's the most common, most well-known.
[00:59:54.353 --> 00:59:55.894]  But it's in the damn Communist Manifesto.
[00:59:56.875 --> 01:00:03.060]  And everything she's proposing, grabbing IP, grabbing patents, shutting down companies, fining people for their political beliefs.
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:06.222]  This is absolute Communism 101.
[01:00:07.023 --> 01:00:08.244]  So let's play the CNN clip.
[01:00:10.446 --> 01:00:15.090]  And then we will go from the CNN clip
[01:00:16.434 --> 01:00:20.037]  of them admitting the truth, which I know you already know, but it's... Why are they doing this?
[01:00:20.077 --> 01:00:21.097]  I've got some comments after that.
[01:00:21.598 --> 01:00:30.865]  And then Kamala has gone full communist with Trump, and then we'll do them all back-to-back, and then a few minutes of Michael Savage, then I'm gonna come back and start drilling into walls.
[01:00:30.885 --> 01:00:31.225]  Here it is.
[01:00:32.806 --> 01:00:36.609]  Catherine, I hear... I read your piece, and I heard you just mention it.
[01:00:36.909 --> 01:00:39.531]  The federal ban on price gouging for groceries.
[01:00:40.272 --> 01:00:41.593]  You are skeptical of this.
[01:00:41.673 --> 01:00:41.853]  Why?
[01:00:43.962 --> 01:00:47.405]  Well, first of all, nobody can explain what price gouging means.
[01:00:47.985 --> 01:00:51.007]  It's like that old line about pornography.
[01:00:51.107 --> 01:00:52.208]  I know it when I see it.
[01:00:53.089 --> 01:00:58.492]  In the sense that, what does it mean to have an excessive price or an excessive profit margin?
[01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:04.657]  That seems to be shorthand for a price or a profit margin that bugs me, that seems too high.
[01:01:05.538 --> 01:01:08.981]  So, you know, it's very hard to pin down what this would actually mean.
[01:01:09.441 --> 01:01:20.752]  If you look at the legislation that, as I mentioned, is already in the Senate, led by Senator Warren and Senator Bob Casey and a slew of others,
[01:01:21.372 --> 01:01:46.357]  The particular way that this is written, which is likely to be the template for any proposal that Harris would eventually embrace, is especially bad in that it just bans excessive prices, grossly excessive prices, grossly excessive profit margins, and says that the Federal Trade Commission can use any metric it deems appropriate to decide what that would mean.
[01:01:46.377 --> 01:01:47.897]  By the way, hit pause.
[01:01:48.198 --> 01:01:48.518]  Hit pause.
[01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:49.258]  Back it up five seconds.
[01:01:49.318 --> 01:01:50.058]  I've got to make comments.
[01:01:50.078 --> 01:01:50.238]  Sorry.
[01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:54.252]  Yeah, that's in the proposal, and it's now out on paper.
[01:01:54.832 --> 01:02:07.902]  Any metric, anything they say, it's like the UK has laws, you have free speech, but they passed a law a few years ago that says, but if we deem it might stir someone else up to be violent, then we're going to charge you with terrorism.
[01:02:08.182 --> 01:02:19.410]  By the way, they've officially proposed Friday in the UK, and it's an executive ruling, so it's not even a law, which again, doesn't even trump laws, but they ignore it, that if you are misogynistic,
[01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:21.989]  You're a terrorist.
[01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:25.770]  That's on Infowars.com with the links to the UK News.
[01:02:27.691 --> 01:02:30.052]  So now, that's any definition they want.
[01:02:30.352 --> 01:02:40.355]  I mean, again, all the craziness that you saw at the universities, saying no white people allowed this week at the school at Evergreen, all those places, in Kansas State.
[01:02:40.375 --> 01:02:42.275]  You're like, oh, those are crazy people.
[01:02:42.315 --> 01:02:47.537]  Yeah, they're making the youth crazy, believing all this crap, but the people on top are behavioral psychologists.
[01:02:48.291 --> 01:02:49.531]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:02:49.571 --> 01:03:02.875]  Again, whether you're in Australia, Europe, or the U.S., anywhere Western, it's the same program, the same operation, all funded by the BlackRock, all funded by the central banks, all funded by the big tax-free foundations.
[01:03:02.935 --> 01:03:04.015]  This is the global order.
[01:03:05.135 --> 01:03:06.576]  But you heard her.
[01:03:06.836 --> 01:03:14.518]  Any metric they see fit, show you're charging 100% markup on this dish detergent.
[01:03:16.752 --> 01:03:18.453]  Well, and then they metric in at the grocery store.
[01:03:18.473 --> 01:03:20.734]  They've got to do that with all their costs and things to be able to make money.
[01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:21.875]  Nope.
[01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:24.056]  We just we just didn't deem that a scam.
[01:03:24.537 --> 01:03:26.318]  You've got to charge 25% markup.
[01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:27.459]  Well, then you go bankrupt.
[01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:30.400]  So this is sick.
[01:03:30.781 --> 01:03:31.261]  Let's continue.
[01:03:32.657 --> 01:03:39.643]  To decide what that what that would would mean, which basically says like it's not going to be markets.
[01:03:39.723 --> 01:03:41.345]  It's not going to be supply and demand.
[01:03:41.425 --> 01:03:47.870]  That's determining how much your grocery store charges you for for milk or for eggs.
[01:03:48.031 --> 01:03:52.695]  It's going to be some bureaucrat in D.C., which seems like totally unworkable, first of all.
[01:03:53.195 --> 01:03:59.541]  For the FTC to be deciding, like, how much Kroger charges for eggs in Michigan.
[01:04:00.602 --> 01:04:02.804]  But it also would be very bad for markets.
[01:04:02.844 --> 01:04:06.828]  We've seen this kind of thing tried in lots of other countries before.
[01:04:07.228 --> 01:04:10.571]  Venezuela, Argentina, the Soviet Union, etc.
[01:04:10.992 --> 01:04:12.173]  It leads to shortages.
[01:04:12.253 --> 01:04:14.835]  It leads to black markets.
[01:04:15.396 --> 01:04:17.658]  You know, plenty of uncertainty.
[01:04:18.616 --> 01:04:40.428]  And beyond that, the specific way this bill is written might actually increase prices because of some of the other language in it, things like requiring companies, public companies, to disclose in their quarterly reports, their quarterly earnings reports, how they're setting prices, which is a great way to help them collude, which normally we don't want them to do.
[01:04:40.768 --> 01:04:45.571]  So anyway, you know, the devil's in the details, I guess, for that bill, but it's really hard for me to imagine
[01:04:46.406 --> 01:04:56.949]  Any form of legislation that, uh, preserves the spirit of what she's proposing that would not be, uh, you know, at best, do nothing, at worst, cause a lot of harm.
[01:04:58.029 --> 01:05:00.149]  Kamala went full communist.
[01:05:00.169 --> 01:05:00.769]  You heard that?
[01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:02.210]  She went full communist.
[01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:03.630]  She wants to destroy our country.
[01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:13.452]  After causing catastrophic inflation, comrade Kamala announced that she wants to institute socialist price controls.
[01:05:13.492 --> 01:05:14.073]  You saw that.
[01:05:14.133 --> 01:05:14.913]  Never worked before.
[01:05:14.973 --> 01:05:15.793]  Never ever worked.
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:19.282]  This is the Maduro plan, Venezuela.
[01:05:19.362 --> 01:05:24.806]  Maduro plan of, like, the old Soviet Union.
[01:05:24.846 --> 01:05:25.787]  This is — they tried it.
[01:05:26.027 --> 01:05:27.768]  How did the Soviet Union work out?
[01:05:27.788 --> 01:05:28.669]  It became Russia.
[01:05:28.749 --> 01:05:29.570]  Smaller version.
[01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:31.131]  It was a smaller version.
[01:05:32.626 --> 01:05:40.190]  It will cause rationing, hunger, and skyrocketing prices, just like their Inflation Reduction Act caused.
[01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:42.451]  One of the great scams of all time.
[01:05:43.051 --> 01:05:50.035]  They got it approved with a beautiful name, Inflation Reduction, because inflation under their system has been so bad.
[01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:51.856]  It's gone up much more than 50%.
[01:05:52.196 --> 01:05:55.498]  You know, they say 30, 40, 50, much more.
[01:05:55.578 --> 01:05:56.798]  People are being devastated.
[01:05:57.078 --> 01:05:58.139]  They're being devastated.
[01:05:58.159 --> 01:06:02.001]  This is Michael Savage on the Friday afternoon edition of
[01:06:02.801 --> 01:06:04.142]  The Savage Nation.
[01:06:04.502 --> 01:06:14.388]  Today I'm going to talk with you about the Stalinist regime that is waiting in the wings to destroy America and imprison the population.
[01:06:15.259 --> 01:06:19.660]  Now, you may say that's a little histrionic, and it can't happen here, and I would say... Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:19.840]  Stop him.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:20.360]  Stop him again.
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.260]  I'm going to make one more comment.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:26.841]  I'm going to go ahead and play five minutes of this, but I'm going to repost this on X, as opposed to, like, last night.
[01:06:26.921 --> 01:06:32.063]  I'm going to repost this at the top of my Real Alex Jones, so you can watch it and listen, because this guy's super smart.
[01:06:32.083 --> 01:06:32.963]  And you heard Trump.
[01:06:32.983 --> 01:06:34.463]  He says she wants to destroy it on purpose.
[01:06:34.663 --> 01:06:36.363]  So he did go there, but he didn't elaborate.
[01:06:37.204 --> 01:06:40.064]  Savage in his 15 minutes explains it, and he's a historian.
[01:06:40.604 --> 01:06:43.165]  He's done the research, probably more than I have, and I'm getting chills right now.
[01:06:43.965 --> 01:06:47.126]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's Democrats all over the place saying they're going to put us in camps.
[01:06:47.166 --> 01:06:48.606]  They built COVID camps just to cover.
[01:06:48.946 --> 01:06:50.347]  Raskin says they're going to have a civil war.
[01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:52.307]  Do you understand they're planning this?
[01:06:53.048 --> 01:06:55.868]  They're going to do a big-ass cyber attack and take us all off the air.
[01:06:55.888 --> 01:07:05.311]  We've got 78 days left of the election, and then 79 to that, and I... I feel sick just sitting here waiting for it to happen.
[01:07:06.581 --> 01:07:08.682]  There needs to be absolute, total urgency.
[01:07:08.862 --> 01:07:17.227]  Naomi Wolf, former top Democrat strategist, said they got foreign troops from China, martial law, arrest everybody, totally take over, and she's totally awake now.
[01:07:17.487 --> 01:07:18.087]  She's smart.
[01:07:18.408 --> 01:07:20.649]  Her husband's been an intelligence operative in the military.
[01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:22.130]  He's the one telling her all this.
[01:07:24.451 --> 01:07:25.792]  Oh my God, excuse me.
[01:07:26.232 --> 01:07:27.213]  Oh, I'm so freaked out.
[01:07:27.473 --> 01:07:28.793]  I mean, we should be freaked out.
[01:07:29.034 --> 01:07:31.935]  I mean, they are really... The borders are dissolved.
[01:07:33.376 --> 01:07:34.797]  They commit any crimes they want.
[01:07:36.425 --> 01:07:40.889]  They're human trafficking hundreds of thousands of children in physical labor slavery and sex slavery.
[01:07:41.130 --> 01:07:42.331]  The Senate admits it.
[01:07:42.651 --> 01:07:43.692]  The Border Patrol admits it.
[01:07:43.752 --> 01:07:45.794]  And Mayorkas isn't under a damn prison!
[01:07:48.917 --> 01:07:49.958]  And they're so arrogant.
[01:07:50.919 --> 01:07:53.482]  Like, for those of us that are awake, we know Monkeypox is a fraud.
[01:07:54.343 --> 01:07:55.684]  We know this stuff's all a scam.
[01:07:55.744 --> 01:07:56.685]  We predicted it would come.
[01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:57.566]  It happened right on time.
[01:07:57.586 --> 01:07:59.348]  I got big news on that coming up at RecoverWaltz.
[01:08:02.605 --> 01:08:07.590]  But to still a large portion of the public, they believe whatever they're told.
[01:08:08.151 --> 01:08:10.493]  They go out and get 10 booster shots till they die.
[01:08:11.695 --> 01:08:13.156]  And they're just rolling it out.
[01:08:13.276 --> 01:08:19.523]  I mean, I've been telling you for years, right before the next general election, they're going to launch monkey pox and bird flu.
[01:08:19.683 --> 01:08:20.484]  And they've done both.
[01:08:20.764 --> 01:08:22.186]  And it's not even hard to predict it!
[01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:29.623]  They got all their war games that they put out two years ago, predicting for the election they would do this.
[01:08:30.564 --> 01:08:32.384]  Dr. David Martin's done a great job breaking it down.
[01:08:33.625 --> 01:08:40.847]  And then Reuters counters saying no evidence that the 2021 Nuclear Threat Initiative exercise proves monkeypox outbreak was planned.
[01:08:41.528 --> 01:08:51.491]  They do all these fake newscasts and war games at the UN global level, predicting exactly what's happening now, just like the SPARS plan, just like Event 201, just like Operation Lockstep.
[01:08:51.511 --> 01:08:52.752]  I want to show people overhead shot, please.
[01:08:56.857 --> 01:08:57.137]  Look at this.
[01:08:57.157 --> 01:08:57.477]  Zoom in.
[01:08:59.038 --> 01:09:03.240]  No evidence the 2021 nuclear threat exercise proves monkeypox outbreak was planned.
[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:03.880]  Yeah.
[01:09:04.721 --> 01:09:09.163]  I've got a 25 minute breakdown by David Martin.
[01:09:12.244 --> 01:09:14.646]  That I think I'll just play the whole thing on tomorrow's show.
[01:09:16.046 --> 01:09:20.669]  And I posted on Real Alex Jones on X. And it's only got like a half million views.
[01:09:20.729 --> 01:09:22.249]  It needs a hundred fricking million views.
[01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:24.610]  And thank God Elon Musk got a billion with Trump.
[01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:25.171]  That was great.
[01:09:26.192 --> 01:09:26.773]  Last Monday.
[01:09:26.993 --> 01:09:29.576]  But imagine if they would have covered this on there.
[01:09:30.757 --> 01:09:32.278]  I don't want to be the one covering it.
[01:09:32.299 --> 01:09:33.440]  I don't want to be the tip of the spear.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.684]  I don't want to be here like a few others like Martin and others that got the full enemy plan.
[01:09:38.745 --> 01:09:41.008]  I want to see Elon Musk and I want to see Trump cover it.
[01:09:41.028 --> 01:09:41.869]  We're starting to see it.
[01:09:42.429 --> 01:09:47.475]  But dammit, Trump's got to hit him now, Elon Musk's got to hit him now, and you've got to hit him now.
[01:09:48.456 --> 01:09:51.617]  There's one other group that's got that reach, and it's the millions of our listeners.
[01:09:51.837 --> 01:10:05.961]  When you get motivated, you decide to go to Real Alex Jones, and you decide to share these on your email list, your text message, by word of mouth, back on X. When you decide to go crazy and go to Real Alex Jones and find this stuff and share it, then we reach 50 million, 100 million.
[01:10:07.201 --> 01:10:12.323]  But I'm sitting here reaching 5, 10, 20, 30 million a day, but the big things are only a few million of that.
[01:10:13.623 --> 01:10:15.784]  And I'm just trying to desperately get you to understand.
[01:10:17.247 --> 01:10:22.110]  Let's finish up with the communism plan to cut off the food and cut off the resources and why they do it with Michael Savage and start back at the beginning.
[01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:24.811]  We'll play some of this and then I'm going to get into walls.
[01:10:26.312 --> 01:10:28.333]  Should I even cover the fact he's a communist Chinese agent?
[01:10:28.373 --> 01:10:28.913]  It's proven.
[01:10:28.953 --> 01:10:29.373]  It's known.
[01:10:29.854 --> 01:10:30.894]  I know most of you know it.
[01:10:30.934 --> 01:10:32.335]  Maybe I should just cut a report on it tomorrow.
[01:10:32.395 --> 01:10:34.436]  It's all short and to the point.
[01:10:34.796 --> 01:10:35.977]  No, I'll hit it because I said I would.
[01:10:36.397 --> 01:10:39.779]  It's just a certain point I'm like, hell, their policies are communist.
[01:10:40.919 --> 01:10:42.040]  Basically lives in China.
[01:10:43.021 --> 01:10:45.502]  But it's just, it's cancer is what it is.
[01:10:47.533 --> 01:10:48.254]  Oh my goodness.
[01:10:48.534 --> 01:10:49.655]  Let's go back to Michael Savage.
[01:10:49.695 --> 01:10:50.055]  Here it is.
[01:10:51.957 --> 01:10:55.359]  Now you may say that's a little histrionic and it can't happen here.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.600]  Start over at the beginning.
[01:10:57.121 --> 01:10:57.701]  At the beginning.
[01:11:00.363 --> 01:11:06.088]  This is Michael Savage on the Friday afternoon edition of The Savage Nation.
[01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:16.336]  Today I'm going to talk with you about the Stalinist regime that is waiting in the wings to destroy America and imprison the population.
[01:11:17.188 --> 01:11:22.470]  Now, you may say that's a little histrionic and it can't happen here, and I would say, oh yeah?
[01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:24.831]  Oh yeah, you sure of that?
[01:11:24.971 --> 01:11:25.991]  Are you sure of that?
[01:11:27.011 --> 01:11:43.537]  So, the other day, the invisible hologram called Kamala Harris, Chameleon Harris, comes out and she starts to screech about food prices being too high and that she's going to rein in food prices by
[01:11:44.968 --> 01:11:47.389]  attacking the greedy supermarket chains.
[01:11:48.389 --> 01:11:50.530]  And I said, wait a minute, I've heard this before.
[01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:56.792]  This is a policy right out of 1930, USSR, under Stalin.
[01:11:57.992 --> 01:12:02.194]  And it begins by demonizing people.
[01:12:02.374 --> 01:12:04.014]  This is what Kamala Harris is doing.
[01:12:04.114 --> 01:12:10.356]  She's demonizing people who own food markets, food chains, just like Stalin did.
[01:12:11.176 --> 01:12:12.857]  The demonization is the beginning.
[01:12:13.553 --> 01:12:20.979]  The end is the imprisonment and or execution of people they don't like.
[01:12:21.019 --> 01:12:23.701]  You say it can't happen here, then you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
[01:12:24.641 --> 01:12:27.243]  Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it.
[01:12:27.283 --> 01:12:32.167]  And if you're a dummy, you don't know history, would you please relieve me of you and get away from me?
[01:12:32.227 --> 01:12:32.627]  Go away.
[01:12:33.368 --> 01:12:34.388]  Go back to grade school.
[01:12:34.409 --> 01:12:37.851]  Go smoke a doobie somewhere because you don't know what the hell you're thinking, even, idiot.
[01:12:39.432 --> 01:12:41.594]  So, a policy like this
[01:12:42.483 --> 01:12:47.905]  Is coming from the Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, communist wing of the Democrat Party.
[01:12:48.065 --> 01:12:53.207]  A very activist part of the Democrat Party is now completely communistic.
[01:12:53.927 --> 01:13:01.230]  So, let me tell you the little story about Chameleon Harris demonizing those who own grocery chains.
[01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:03.511]  You know what the profit margin is in the supermarket?
[01:13:03.551 --> 01:13:03.711]  About 1.5%.
[01:13:03.751 --> 01:13:03.711]  1.5%.
[01:13:03.831 --> 01:13:06.512]  It's the slimmest of margins in the supermarkets.
[01:13:11.309 --> 01:13:15.770]  I go in a supermarket, I'm astounded at the selection that I see.
[01:13:15.970 --> 01:13:27.592]  And I'm reminded of what could happen in a nation if it's run by morons and psychopathic communists like Harris Waltz, where people were fighting over one salami in a butcher store.
[01:13:28.593 --> 01:13:32.193]  So let me take you back in time.
[01:13:32.573 --> 01:13:32.193]  1930.
[01:13:33.334 --> 01:13:35.114]  Joseph Stalin, the dictator, is ruling.
[01:13:35.834 --> 01:13:39.215]  But he's not able to control this entire huge nation called the USSR.
[01:13:41.081 --> 01:13:43.701]  He thinks he's surrounded by enemies, okay?
[01:13:43.741 --> 01:13:45.822]  He thinks he's being hunted down by secret police.
[01:13:45.842 --> 01:13:47.782]  He's a total paranoid lunatic.
[01:13:48.742 --> 01:13:50.763]  But nothing can get in the way of his utopia.
[01:13:51.823 --> 01:13:53.023]  Does that sound familiar to you?
[01:13:53.043 --> 01:13:54.563]  The utopia of Harris Walz?
[01:13:55.644 --> 01:14:05.805]  They want to transform Russia into a gigantic, a gigantic farm populated by peasants who are now working for the government.
[01:14:06.726 --> 01:14:08.406]  And it's called a five-year plan.
[01:14:09.744 --> 01:14:15.729]  But what happens is, the Russians are a noble, strong people, as then the Ukrainians were.
[01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:19.072]  Never forget, Ukraine was the breadbasket of Europe.
[01:14:19.713 --> 01:14:24.858]  And of course, most of the wheat and other grains were produced in Ukraine.
[01:14:24.898 --> 01:14:28.801]  And we're going to talk about this another time here, why food prices are so high.
[01:14:28.821 --> 01:14:30.263]  It's the war in Ukraine, incidentally.
[01:14:30.783 --> 01:14:33.325]  Have you seen many exports of grain coming out of Ukraine?
[01:14:33.986 --> 01:14:35.127]  No, you haven't seen much of them.
[01:14:35.794 --> 01:14:39.036]  So, Stalin is immediately stopped by the peasants themselves.
[01:14:39.536 --> 01:14:40.857]  They won't give up their land.
[01:14:41.457 --> 01:14:43.459]  They reject collectivization.
[01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:45.340]  You know what collectivization is?
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.041]  That's Harris-Waltz.
[01:14:48.001 --> 01:14:49.522]  They want collectivization.
[01:14:50.803 --> 01:14:53.885]  So, what is Stalin and his intellectual degenerates?
[01:14:54.145 --> 01:14:54.925]  What do they do next?
[01:14:55.826 --> 01:15:04.811]  They slander the farmers by calling them kulak, which means profiteer or exploiter, just as Bernie Sanders and the squad
[01:15:05.655 --> 01:15:13.701]  Have labeled you, the middle class, profiteers or exploiters of the poor, of the immigrant, of the criminal, of the queer.
[01:15:14.962 --> 01:15:18.425]  And he then defines the term of what a kulak is.
[01:15:19.445 --> 01:15:29.933]  Any farmer who uses hired labor, anyone who owns a mill, a creamery, a potato dryer, mechanical agricultural equipment with a motor or livestock.
[01:15:30.794 --> 01:15:33.776]  So, the definition is so broad and so vague,
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:39.943]  That there are now false accusations against people, and there's scores settling throughout Russia.
[01:15:40.583 --> 01:15:47.487]  People are murdered, raped, and people are then attacked by the police who attempt to hide their grain reserves.
[01:15:48.727 --> 01:15:59.973]  The resistance of the Soviet peasants is so great that the communist state mobilizes 27,000 dekulakazizers.
[01:16:00.833 --> 01:16:01.714]  These are communist
[01:16:03.007 --> 01:16:09.772]  City dwellers, mainly militants from Moscow and other main cities, who are shipped in from the cities.
[01:16:10.393 --> 01:16:18.258]  Let's imagine BLM or Antifa being hired by Harris-Waltz to go into the farms.
[01:16:19.579 --> 01:16:29.567]  And they go out there and they start to beat people up and steal their grain and send it back to Moscow so the elites can eat while the peasants starve.
[01:16:31.943 --> 01:16:32.803]  What happens next?
[01:16:33.704 --> 01:16:34.985]  Are you ready for what happens next?
[01:16:35.765 --> 01:16:38.947]  Stalin's police send back a report to Moscow.
[01:16:39.747 --> 01:16:43.029]  We remove the peasants' winter clothes and warm undergarments.
[01:16:43.749 --> 01:16:44.850]  We take their shoes.
[01:16:45.570 --> 01:16:53.195]  We even go so far as to confiscate the pillows under their children's heads and all the religious icons to burn them all.
[01:16:54.175 --> 01:16:57.417]  If you think it can't happen here, you're a bigger idiot than your mother thought you were.
[01:16:58.729 --> 01:17:02.050]  Now, there were famines in Russia in 1918 and 1921.
[01:17:03.431 --> 01:17:06.072]  The 1918 famine followed the Bolshevik Revolution.
[01:17:07.133 --> 01:17:08.053]  Another famine occurred in 1921.
[01:17:09.654 --> 01:17:20.498]  But the famine organized by Stalin from the early 1930s that I'm trying to tell you about right now was the most devastating of all, especially in Ukraine.
[01:17:21.659 --> 01:17:27.221]  Five million human beings are starved to death in Ukraine mainly.
[01:17:28.539 --> 01:17:32.201]  And we are told we call the famine Hulodomor.
[01:17:32.741 --> 01:17:37.143]  Hulodomor in Ukrainian means extermination by starvation.
[01:17:38.003 --> 01:17:42.785]  Everything was taken from the Ukrainian farmers down to the very last crumb.
[01:17:43.546 --> 01:17:51.269]  A mother was known to have killed her own child with an axe to cook the child and feed him to others and no one asked any questions.
[01:17:51.949 --> 01:17:54.350]  Now you say that's a little extreme and it can't happen here?
[01:17:55.291 --> 01:17:55.471]  Even
[01:17:56.639 --> 01:17:58.420]  Oaks begin with acorns.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:17:59.720]  It can happen here.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:10.064]  So, when you hear Harris demonizing those who own supermarket chains, you are hearing history repeat itself again.
[01:18:10.864 --> 01:18:16.106]  And if you want to read more about it, why do you think this book was called Inside the Plot to Destroy America?
[01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:27.121]  I didn't think it would be Harris, but I knew it would be the Democrat Party USA, which is a direct copy of the CPUSA, the Communist Party USA.
[01:18:27.801 --> 01:18:34.142]  And in this book, I say the Civil War is here in Chapter 1, and I write about the new Kulaks.
[01:18:34.922 --> 01:18:36.123]  And who are the new Kulaks?
[01:18:36.423 --> 01:18:36.863]  You are.
[01:18:37.843 --> 01:18:43.805]  Anyone who doesn't vote for Kamala Harris is now a Kulak to Waltz and to Harris.
[01:18:44.825 --> 01:18:45.545]  I'll tell you again.
[01:18:46.704 --> 01:18:47.404]  I'll read it to you.
[01:18:47.765 --> 01:18:48.565]  It's a little different.
[01:18:48.605 --> 01:18:49.426]  The same story.
[01:18:50.426 --> 01:18:51.567]  Let's just stop right there.
[01:18:51.587 --> 01:18:57.450]  I remember a few years ago, that book came out, having him on about that, and we need to get him back on the show.
[01:18:58.231 --> 01:19:00.692]  So, in fact, guys, I know Savage is hard to get.
[01:19:00.712 --> 01:19:04.114]  He's a big supporter, says nice things, but he's really hard to get.
[01:19:04.714 --> 01:19:06.535]  But now is the time we need Michael Savage.
[01:19:06.656 --> 01:19:12.519]  I don't normally play long clips of somebody else's show, but he is dead on, okay?
[01:19:13.119 --> 01:19:12.519]  100%.
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:14.660]  I read his book when it came out.
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:15.120]  It's 100% happening now.
[01:19:16.678 --> 01:19:16.938]  Okay.
[01:19:18.058 --> 01:19:19.999]  And we're gonna look at walls.
[01:19:20.939 --> 01:19:23.799]  We come back and we're gonna look at the monkey pox because that's their one to punch.
[01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:25.600]  Civil unrest, monkey pox.
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:27.680]  We got war, cyber attacks.
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:28.580]  I mean, they're gonna hit us.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.161]  This is it because they know America is so close to getting our country back.
[01:19:32.481 --> 01:19:33.361]  We are so close.
[01:19:33.381 --> 01:19:36.381]  America is hard to take over by communists, but they're damn close.
[01:19:36.401 --> 01:19:37.942]  We gotta admit what we're facing!
[01:19:37.962 --> 01:19:45.863]  Alright, I'm gonna spend some time on Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota.
[01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:51.519]  And I'm not going to spend a lot of time recapping that he had the National Guard stand down in 2020.
[01:19:51.579 --> 01:19:57.523]  His wife endorsed it, said she loved the riots, the smell of burning tires, kept her windows open, loves revolution.
[01:19:58.684 --> 01:20:03.427]  Oh, but a few people go in the Capitol, throw the book at them on January 6th, or say they're all terrorists.
[01:20:04.988 --> 01:20:08.831]  Same way in the UK, Muslims burn everything down, murdering, raping, killing, that's fine.
[01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:11.613]  Few people get mad and fight back.
[01:20:11.673 --> 01:20:13.974]  They're the worst terrorist ever, people being arrested for their speech.
[01:20:14.955 --> 01:20:15.856]  Not even calling for violence.
[01:20:16.972 --> 01:20:22.216]  So we started hearing weeks ago when she became his her VP pick.
[01:20:22.236 --> 01:20:26.018]  Remember, neither he or she got one vote in the primary.
[01:20:26.799 --> 01:20:32.003]  We know Biden stole the election, but you can still have some shred of debate on that.
[01:20:33.764 --> 01:20:34.905]  But he's supposedly the president.
[01:20:35.505 --> 01:20:36.646]  Well, they just remove him.
[01:20:36.666 --> 01:20:37.927]  He has a medical emergency.
[01:20:37.947 --> 01:20:39.268]  He's gone for seven, eight days.
[01:20:39.808 --> 01:20:40.949]  Shows up all drugged out.
[01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:43.311]  Basically admits the Democrats removed him.
[01:20:44.552 --> 01:20:46.173]  I mean, did they put a gun to his head?
[01:20:47.708 --> 01:20:50.450]  It'll be your brains or a signature on this piece of paper?
[01:20:50.951 --> 01:20:51.691]  Like the Godfather?
[01:20:51.711 --> 01:20:54.133]  Give him a no if he can't refuse.
[01:20:56.015 --> 01:20:57.236]  And they just tried to kill Trump?
[01:20:58.737 --> 01:20:58.917]  What?
[01:21:01.479 --> 01:21:01.980]  37 days ago?
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.342]  I mean, do you see where we are?
[01:21:05.883 --> 01:21:07.904]  There's a normalcy bias to everybody.
[01:21:08.645 --> 01:21:09.806]  I think we're in normal times.
[01:21:09.906 --> 01:21:10.967]  No, we're not in Kansas.
[01:21:12.128 --> 01:21:17.092]  So, I started hearing about a week ago from college students
[01:21:18.393 --> 01:21:21.815]  That went on trips that he would sponsor with the Communist Chinese government.
[01:21:23.195 --> 01:21:26.477]  And this is in newspaper articles from the early 90s.
[01:21:27.337 --> 01:21:41.944]  So he goes to college in the 80s, and he gets his degree, and he joins the Confucian Society, which is admitted Communist Chinese government run.
[01:21:41.984 --> 01:21:43.244]  They've now been outlawed in the U.S.
[01:21:43.624 --> 01:21:46.926]  going back five years ago, six years ago, the middle of Trump's term.
[01:21:48.109 --> 01:21:48.489]  Admitted.
[01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:50.750]  Run by the Chinese government.
[01:21:52.311 --> 01:21:54.071]  And then he goes and basically lives there.
[01:21:54.552 --> 01:21:55.612]  We got a clip of him saying that.
[01:21:56.672 --> 01:22:01.754]  At first it was 18 trips, then 23 trips, then 36 trips, and now it's like, well, he lived there.
[01:22:05.316 --> 01:22:09.878]  And he's probably a double agent because he'd be given extended leave and stuff to go, you know, stay there for three, four months.
[01:22:09.938 --> 01:22:12.258]  I mean... Weirdness, folks.
[01:22:12.519 --> 01:22:13.939]  But he's clearly working for them.
[01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:15.740]  So...
[01:22:17.859 --> 01:22:28.001]  Now these newspaper articles come out because a week ago, the students were going public, doing interviews, being interviewed by newspapers, saying, look, he promoted Mao.
[01:22:28.061 --> 01:22:29.982]  He said Tiananmen Square was good.
[01:22:30.022 --> 01:22:30.922]  They killed those people.
[01:22:32.282 --> 01:22:33.982]  He is a hardcore Maoist.
[01:22:34.543 --> 01:22:36.283]  He has a collection of Mao memorabilia.
[01:22:36.323 --> 01:22:38.944]  He gives everybody little red books and says, you should follow this.
[01:22:40.684 --> 01:22:42.324]  I mean, this is hardcore.
[01:22:43.344 --> 01:22:45.485]  Even to the Communist Chinese, they've rejected most of Mao.
[01:22:47.008 --> 01:22:48.369]  Xi Jinping's gone back to some of it.
[01:22:50.151 --> 01:22:55.095]  But just in, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, again, supports a guy that killed over 80 million of his own people.
[01:22:56.316 --> 01:23:02.861]  Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, with the Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris running mate, had a friend in China's Foreign Affairs Department.
[01:23:04.262 --> 01:23:07.725]  Because it's not just the students saying it now, they found the news articles!
[01:23:07.745 --> 01:23:08.726]  We got a whole bunch of them!
[01:23:12.369 --> 01:23:14.191]  And the Chinese government
[01:23:16.596 --> 01:23:23.920]  Their state department used him as an agent to run a whole bunch of trips into China to the Confucian Center.
[01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:26.662]  So that right there, you're a communist Chinese agent.
[01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:36.968]  Then he talks about all the wonderful gifts the Chinese communists gave him and how wonderful it was and told his students and told the groups he led, you're going to get a lot of free stuff.
[01:23:37.448 --> 01:23:40.890]  So much stuff you quote, can't even carry it all home.
[01:23:43.532 --> 01:23:43.912]  Oh, yeah.
[01:23:45.336 --> 01:23:52.762]  You don't think I couldn't snap my fingers and go into the Chinese embassy, closest one, and be paid millions of dollars like that to work for them?
[01:23:53.782 --> 01:23:55.684]  That's why half of Congress is on their payroll.
[01:23:57.806 --> 01:24:03.510]  With eight other adult sponsors, Walls took 26 teenagers to China in 93, a local newspaper reported the change.
[01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:05.772]  It turns out he did a whole bunch of these trips.
[01:24:06.352 --> 01:24:10.395]  You've got to go read it for yourself.
[01:24:10.435 --> 01:24:12.437]  And I've got blowups of some of the news articles right here.
[01:24:13.037 --> 01:24:14.939]  Boarding the Orient Express.
[01:24:16.630 --> 01:24:17.511]  With Tim Walz.
[01:24:19.672 --> 01:24:20.952]  So let's play a few of these clips.
[01:24:22.453 --> 01:24:26.215]  Here's Governor Tim Walz brags about how he lived in China.
[01:24:26.715 --> 01:24:27.536]  I speak Chinese.
[01:24:27.576 --> 01:24:29.197]  I'm pretty friendly with China.
[01:24:29.537 --> 01:24:30.237]  This is in public.
[01:24:30.938 --> 01:24:33.239]  Do we want a vice president who's friendly with the CCP?
[01:24:33.279 --> 01:24:34.760]  Tim Walz is an open communist.
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:36.921]  Yeah, he said being a socialist is a good neighbor.
[01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:45.035]  Chairman Walz ran for Congress in 2006 on focusing and fostering cooperation with Communist China.
[01:24:45.335 --> 01:24:47.657]  Walz's love affair with Communist China spans decades.
[01:24:47.897 --> 01:24:48.738]  Well, look at, uh...
[01:24:50.031 --> 01:24:56.313]  Justin Trudeau, the head of Canada, saying, asked by a few years ago, what's your favorite form of government?
[01:24:56.353 --> 01:24:57.153]  What do you admire most?
[01:24:57.213 --> 01:25:03.315]  Communist China, Xi Jinping's basic dictatorship, because you can get stuff done.
[01:25:04.236 --> 01:25:12.719]  Then you got Walls always saying, mind your own business, unless it's chopping your kid's penis off, or brainwashing them they're really a girl, or spying on you or censoring you.
[01:25:13.399 --> 01:25:16.520]  When he says he's only talking about abortion and sexual perversion,
[01:25:18.345 --> 01:25:23.389]  Everything else, your money, your kids, your food, your medical decisions, your online speech, all his business.
[01:25:26.592 --> 01:25:28.033]  And here's some of the articles about it.
[01:25:28.093 --> 01:25:29.094]  I should have just started with this.
[01:25:29.814 --> 01:25:33.397]  There's been investigations launched into him as a Communist Chinese spy.
[01:25:34.779 --> 01:25:39.643]  Lawmakers launch investigation to waltz over extensive ties to Communist China.
[01:25:41.624 --> 01:25:42.145]  Daily Wire.
[01:25:43.406 --> 01:25:45.808]  Tim Wall's cozy relationship with Communist Chinese probe.
[01:25:46.128 --> 01:25:47.049]  Americans should be deeply
[01:25:48.376 --> 01:25:49.577]  Concerned New York Post.
[01:25:51.659 --> 01:25:56.142]  Then there's his radical support of having the Department of Education take everything over.
[01:25:56.443 --> 01:25:57.664]  Key article in the Gateway Pundit.
[01:25:58.204 --> 01:26:00.466]  So he's as bad as it gets.
[01:26:01.206 --> 01:26:03.488]  Socialism is when you line up for bread.
[01:26:04.349 --> 01:26:07.612]  Capitalism is when the bread lines up for you.
[01:26:09.954 --> 01:26:10.854]  And why would they want that?
[01:26:10.914 --> 01:26:11.315]  Because
[01:26:12.858 --> 01:26:15.964]  They want you as a domesticated animal that can't be self-sufficient.
[01:26:16.044 --> 01:26:20.392]  So let's go ahead and play these two newest clips of him talking about living in China.
[01:26:22.321 --> 01:26:23.501]  Totally sick, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:51.809 --> 01:26:53.591]  So he is a communist Chinese agent, 100%.
[01:26:53.851 --> 01:27:05.243]  And if you're a loyal, good American who doesn't commit crime and works hard, you're the enemy.
[01:27:05.863 --> 01:27:08.626]  And you're being told there's going to be a civil war between us and these guys.
[01:27:08.646 --> 01:27:11.950]  People are like, well, we'll take these commies out.
[01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:14.753]  They want to fight because they're losing politically.
[01:27:15.711 --> 01:27:20.195]  They control, though, the big tech companies, the infrastructure, the power companies.
[01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:22.837]  They will shut the power off and say, we did it.
[01:27:23.857 --> 01:27:27.559]  So everybody's sitting here thinking we're going to walls into this and beat these people.
[01:27:28.239 --> 01:27:30.241]  And it was looking for a physical confrontation.
[01:27:30.321 --> 01:27:36.004]  You are you if you're in a group of people and you're being told to do that, that's a Fed telling you to do that.
[01:27:36.764 --> 01:27:39.846]  The last thing we want or some foundation operative.
[01:27:40.346 --> 01:27:42.888]  The last thing we want is physical violence.
[01:27:42.928 --> 01:27:44.428]  Now they start all this.
[01:27:44.448 --> 01:27:45.169]  This all goes.
[01:27:45.209 --> 01:27:50.632]  They got trucks driving around with the military saying, Oh, you know, the contact tracing says you've got this monkey pox.
[01:27:52.210 --> 01:27:53.231]  We're going to have to round you up.
[01:27:53.251 --> 01:27:54.291]  We're going to take you away.
[01:27:56.673 --> 01:28:04.657]  Well, then, you know, it's going to go there, and I'm really working to stop it from going there.
[01:28:05.578 --> 01:28:08.340]  Now, speaking of monkey pox.
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.042]  I'm going to be getting into that here in just a moment.
[01:28:16.404 --> 01:28:17.765]  And I had requested some documents.
[01:28:17.805 --> 01:28:17.825]  I
[01:28:21.414 --> 01:28:24.576]  So let me let me get my stacks integrated here.
[01:28:27.338 --> 01:28:28.559]  As fast as I can.
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:31.021]  And then we're going to plow.
[01:28:32.702 --> 01:28:34.143]  Straight into all of this.
[01:28:35.184 --> 01:28:35.945]  For you.
[01:28:36.965 --> 01:28:37.506]  Tonight.
[01:28:39.227 --> 01:28:41.709]  And again, we all kind of have a.
[01:28:48.959 --> 01:28:56.161]  Because we're populist, Christians, conservatives, nationalists, anti-communists, just scientific-type people, common-sense people.
[01:28:57.482 --> 01:29:01.003]  We're in our own bubble, and our bubble's expanding, and more people are joining us all the time.
[01:29:01.823 --> 01:29:07.925]  Tyranny's retracting in support, but expanding in its attempt to maintain control through totalitarianism.
[01:29:09.042 --> 01:29:23.830]  But we have a confidency bias in that it's so hard to believe this is happening here, and we know how ridiculous this all is, and it's hard to believe they're going to try the bird flu and the monkey pox and all this, but they're officially doing it right on time with 78 days left for the election.
[01:29:24.531 --> 01:29:29.233]  And you ask, but if it's so hard to get monkey pox, how are they going to spread it?
[01:29:29.273 --> 01:29:30.294]  Well, they have a vector.
[01:29:31.274 --> 01:29:33.475]  We're going to be exposing that in just one moment.
[01:29:33.495 --> 01:29:35.937]  And I don't normally do this, but this report
[01:29:37.725 --> 01:29:46.934]  By John Bowne, it's so important to understand where it all comes from, who's behind it, what their plan is, and why they want to wreck things so it makes sense.
[01:29:46.974 --> 01:29:53.922]  I'm going to air this report one more time and then come back and plow through the monkey pox for you with a devastating video.
[01:29:54.022 --> 01:29:56.785]  I was already planning a coverage tonight that Joe Rogan literally sent me two hours ago.
[01:29:58.026 --> 01:30:00.628]  So, we send each other stuff constantly.
[01:30:01.502 --> 01:30:03.543]  And I was aware of all the info, but very short and sweet.
[01:30:03.563 --> 01:30:08.267]  Did a great job, whoever made this, condensing all of this down.
[01:30:08.287 --> 01:30:09.968]  I want to air SP1.
[01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:16.912]  The Fast Lane to Extinction to explain why these Hellions are doing this.
[01:30:16.932 --> 01:30:17.273]  Here it is.
[01:30:25.718 --> 01:30:26.859]  Your kind is extinct.
[01:30:31.631 --> 01:30:36.155]  If you're human, that is humanity.
[01:30:38.536 --> 01:30:39.597]  It will not last forever.
[01:30:41.899 --> 01:30:44.161]  You can escape from it whenever you choose.
[01:30:45.722 --> 01:30:46.783]  Everything depends on you.
[01:30:47.843 --> 01:30:48.584]  You did it.
[01:30:50.646 --> 01:30:52.487]  You reduced me to this.
[01:30:53.167 --> 01:30:53.828]  No, Winston.
[01:30:57.566 --> 01:31:07.054]  Again, I think that the biggest question maybe in economics and politics of the coming decades will be what to do with all these useless people.
[01:31:07.355 --> 01:31:10.758]  We are losing progress against our sustainable development goals.
[01:31:11.258 --> 01:31:15.502]  We have put billions of dollars towards those goals, and we're truly losing progress.
[01:31:15.842 --> 01:31:19.105]  Many cults reach a point where mass murder is inevitable.
[01:31:19.585 --> 01:31:19.906]  It's the cult.
[01:31:19.926 --> 01:31:21.227]  I mean, it's the cult of cults.
[01:31:22.231 --> 01:31:23.192]  It's the cult of truth!
[01:31:23.433 --> 01:31:26.276]  It is no different with the climate change cult.
[01:31:26.496 --> 01:31:30.400]  We have to phase out fossil fuels because this is a crisis of burning fossil fuels.
[01:31:31.161 --> 01:31:38.750]  It's just quite amazing that someone that is in government actually elected to the government of the United States of America.
[01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:43.991]  ...would propose that we eliminate all fossil fuels in 12 years.
[01:31:44.511 --> 01:31:53.954]  It would basically begin a process of cannibalization amongst the human species because the food could not be delivered to the stores in the middle of the cities anymore.
[01:31:54.074 --> 01:31:59.075]  We now know that definitively at no point during the least the past 800,000 years
[01:32:01.216 --> 01:32:03.817]  Has atmospheric CO2 been as high as it is today?
[01:32:04.137 --> 01:32:13.141]  The reason you chose 800,000 years ago is because for 200 million years before that, it was greater than it is today.
[01:32:13.882 --> 01:32:16.723]  And I'm going to submit for the record... Yeah, but there weren't human beings.
[01:32:16.803 --> 01:32:18.424]  I mean, there was a different world, folks.
[01:32:18.524 --> 01:32:19.884]  We didn't have 7 billion people.
[01:32:19.904 --> 01:32:23.326]  So how did it get to 2,000 parts per million if we humans weren't here?
[01:32:23.586 --> 01:32:30.309]  Because there were all kinds of geologic events happening on Earth which spewed up... Did geology stop when we got on the planet?
[01:32:31.112 --> 01:32:40.114]  Mr. Chairman, I... So if we act together to safeguard our precious planet, the welfare of all our people will surely follow.
[01:32:41.874 --> 01:32:43.614]  The Earth does not belong to us.
[01:32:44.735 --> 01:32:46.475]  We belong to the Earth.
[01:32:46.875 --> 01:32:51.596]  They're chemtrailing with aluminum dioxide all over the world, killing the seeds, the plants, the trees, the insects dying.
[01:32:52.196 --> 01:32:56.197]  They've got the Hadrian Collider, their own scientist, and they can blow the Earth up, the tests they're doing.
[01:32:56.983 --> 01:32:58.546]  They're the ones releasing GMO.
[01:32:58.586 --> 01:32:59.869]  They're the ones with the 5G.
[01:33:00.129 --> 01:33:02.554]  They're the ones saying cut down trees, carbon's bad.
[01:33:02.794 --> 01:33:07.443]  So everything he says is a giant lie, except we own the earth, you don't.
[01:33:07.623 --> 01:33:08.204]  It's ours.
[01:33:08.404 --> 01:33:09.607]  We're the guardians of the earth.
[01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:11.952]  He represents the Earth while he's killing it.
[01:33:12.072 --> 01:33:15.694]  It isn't merely a new coronavirus or a nuclear war.
[01:33:16.015 --> 01:33:20.217]  This overlooked research makes all of those issues meaningless.
[01:33:20.697 --> 01:33:37.087]  An alarming new study has found that between 1973 and 2011, sperm counts in Western males, men in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, dropped from an average of 99 million sperm per cubic centimeter to just 47 million.
[01:33:38.428 --> 01:33:44.554]  Theoretically, if the trend persists, by 2050 our sperm may disappear entirely.
[01:33:44.674 --> 01:33:53.683]  The end of human procreation is right around the bend with a target date of 2045 if human fertility continues its race to the bottom.
[01:33:53.783 --> 01:34:00.650]  It's been a 59% decline in total sperm count over the 40 years of our study.
[01:34:00.930 --> 01:34:02.592]  If the pregnant woman
[01:34:03.494 --> 01:34:07.938]  is exposed to phthalates in early pregnancy.
[01:34:08.578 --> 01:34:16.745]  These phthalates can reduce fetal testosterone at a critical time for male genital sexual development.
[01:34:17.105 --> 01:34:19.287]  Number of children is declining everywhere.
[01:34:20.088 --> 01:34:24.251]  And in fact, the countries that start high, that start with a high number of children,
[01:34:24.938 --> 01:34:25.958]  are going down faster.
[01:34:26.319 --> 01:34:32.781]  Just mathematically, if you'd extended the line, it does hit zero in 2045.
[01:34:33.581 --> 01:34:36.082]  All the planning, all the beta testing is over.
[01:34:36.803 --> 01:34:38.783]  And now, the Great Reset is here.
[01:34:39.684 --> 01:34:40.304]  It's the future.
[01:34:41.524 --> 01:34:43.885]  And for 80 plus percent of us, we're not in it.
[01:34:44.606 --> 01:34:50.408]  Maintain humanity under 500 million in perpetual balance with nature.
[01:34:52.307 --> 01:35:02.956]  Like we're pets, like we're a dog or a cat we take care of, or like we're a museum piece where they cull the population from seven and a half billion down to five hundred million.
[01:35:03.656 --> 01:35:06.138]  I wonder who the lucky people are that are gonna get to live.
[01:35:06.358 --> 01:35:10.902]  Humanity itself is slowly dying and barely anyone knows about it.
[01:35:11.182 --> 01:35:13.144]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.
[01:35:16.547 --> 01:35:18.108]  All right, now let's get into it.
[01:35:18.568 --> 01:35:19.949]  I'll be covering this more tomorrow.
[01:35:19.969 --> 01:35:23.691]  Chase Geyser is coming up here in about 12 minutes.
[01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:46.880]  They've declared the monkeypox pandemic.
[01:35:48.781 --> 01:35:54.162]  China's declaring an emergency just like they did four and a half years ago with the whole COVID hysteria.
[01:35:55.062 --> 01:35:57.923]  All these Democrat mayors and governors are saying, put the masks back on.
[01:35:57.963 --> 01:35:59.023]  Monkeypox is everywhere.
[01:35:59.043 --> 01:36:05.945]  They already tried to shut down the beef and poultry production and slaughtered tens of millions of chickens and turkeys and hundreds of thousands of cows.
[01:36:06.605 --> 01:36:11.486]  They tried to make all the farmers and ranchers do PCR tests turned up on high to say they had the bird flu.
[01:36:11.506 --> 01:36:12.246]  It was all made up.
[01:36:12.466 --> 01:36:13.667]  They said humans had it everywhere.
[01:36:13.707 --> 01:36:14.347]  That was made up.
[01:36:15.663 --> 01:36:21.447]  And now, going back to two years ago, they're bringing back the monkeypox.
[01:36:21.487 --> 01:36:31.293]  Now, they put as the head of the monkeypox division in Biden's White House a super promiscuous homosexual man, doctor,
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:36.121]  And then they would admit that that's the main vector for monkey pox.
[01:36:36.141 --> 01:36:53.746]  Now, if you go back to the hepatitis shots in New York and San Francisco, it's been partially declassified that in the late 70s, they spread HIV in the homosexual population as a vector because they were the best group to spread it because of their highly promiscuous natures.
[01:36:54.626 --> 01:36:57.587]  Some of them hundreds of partners a month, some even more.
[01:36:59.696 --> 01:37:01.677]  And of course, that was the main group that was dying.
[01:37:02.338 --> 01:37:03.839]  Then we give them drugs that help kill them.
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:07.822]  So, look at these headlines.
[01:37:08.442 --> 01:37:09.883]  New global health emergency.
[01:37:10.003 --> 01:37:11.224]  What is MPOX?
[01:37:11.244 --> 01:37:13.866]  Because monkeypox, you already know that was a fraud, so they call it MPOX.
[01:37:14.306 --> 01:37:18.049]  Where are the outbreaks and will the virus spread?
[01:37:18.069 --> 01:37:19.189]  I'm about to play a video in a moment.
[01:37:20.871 --> 01:37:21.571]  Another headline.
[01:37:21.711 --> 01:37:22.332]  That was AP.
[01:37:22.732 --> 01:37:25.374]  Monkeypox is spreading among gay men worldwide.
[01:37:26.823 --> 01:37:27.604]  World Health Organization.
[01:37:27.644 --> 01:37:31.707]  Monkeypox public health advice for gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men.
[01:37:32.147 --> 01:37:40.293]  They're going to admit almost all cases in men to men and a whole bunch of children around the world are getting it by being molested.
[01:37:40.814 --> 01:37:44.277]  You really need to get blood product, that's semen, into the body.
[01:37:45.838 --> 01:37:46.438]  Monkeypox.
[01:37:46.478 --> 01:37:48.500]  Why are gay and bisexual men more affected?
[01:37:51.212 --> 01:37:57.195]  CDC modeling the impact of sexual network and the transmission of monkeypox virus among gay, bisexual and other men.
[01:37:57.255 --> 01:38:00.997]  It goes on to say almost all of them, all the cases was these people.
[01:38:03.158 --> 01:38:04.139]  Now they're spinning it.
[01:38:04.939 --> 01:38:09.942]  Monkeypox can be spread by anyone in close contact and it's not a gay disease, contrary to posts online.
[01:38:10.502 --> 01:38:16.025]  Well I just showed you, that's Reuters, I just showed you the CDC and the UN saying the opposite.
[01:38:16.823 --> 01:38:19.945]  Monkeypox outbreak predominantly affecting men who have had sex with men.
[01:38:20.205 --> 01:38:20.966]  Madrid, Spain.
[01:38:21.366 --> 01:38:21.986]  Major study.
[01:38:22.187 --> 01:38:26.049]  N-C-B-I-N-I-H dot gov.
[01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:27.130]  See that?
[01:38:29.351 --> 01:38:32.533]  That's the NIH website, but oh, Reuters says it's not true!
[01:38:34.255 --> 01:38:34.515]  Okay.
[01:38:35.828 --> 01:38:40.650]  So risk of clad one impacts outbreaks among gay bisexual men.
[01:38:40.690 --> 01:38:41.671]  They have new reports out.
[01:38:41.691 --> 01:38:44.892]  So in the fine print, they admit it, but then on the national news say they're not.
[01:38:45.492 --> 01:38:48.254]  So here's the short video I posted on Relox Jones you need to share.
[01:38:48.274 --> 01:38:50.555]  I put up maximum alert as the link.
[01:38:51.587 --> 01:38:52.708]  New lockdowns incoming.
[01:38:52.728 --> 01:38:55.070]  They built all these emergency viral centers everywhere.
[01:38:55.790 --> 01:39:00.714]  And in these war games that I've got in Reuters, they talk about tens of millions dying from it.
[01:39:00.754 --> 01:39:05.297]  So they're about to release in the homosexual population, a weaponized form of monkeypox.
[01:39:05.677 --> 01:39:08.860]  And in the war games, they admit that's what they would do.
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:13.103]  And these war games are two years ago, and they use the war games as the battle plan.
[01:39:13.323 --> 01:39:17.606]  So the operatives that are out running it, if they get caught, go, Oh, this is just a drill, not
[01:39:19.207 --> 01:39:20.348]  The actual battle plan.
[01:39:20.748 --> 01:39:29.174]  They always do it the same, like SPARS 2025-2028, Operation Lockstep, Event 201, and then it's the exact battle plan.
[01:39:29.674 --> 01:39:30.915]  So here's a short clip.
[01:39:30.955 --> 01:39:33.997]  You want to record this clip, and you want to pause it.
[01:39:34.017 --> 01:39:35.638]  It's got a lot of documents, a lot of articles.
[01:39:35.858 --> 01:39:39.901]  It's very short, but there's an hour of research in this video alone.
[01:39:39.941 --> 01:39:40.301]  Here it is.
[01:39:57.774 --> 01:39:59.975]  And again, this is mainly for TV.
[01:39:59.995 --> 01:40:01.715]  Some radio listeners want to go to... So, just like...
[01:40:29.002 --> 01:40:30.163]  Foushee back at the time.
[01:40:31.164 --> 01:40:33.326]  Ran the operations against the gay population.
[01:40:33.406 --> 01:40:36.909]  Use them as the vector to spread it, then use them spreading it as the fear.
[01:40:37.229 --> 01:40:39.831]  And then later they turned around five years later and said, Oh, you're poor victims.
[01:40:40.411 --> 01:40:45.275]  The world was mean to you and said, you know that people could get AIDS by just touching you or being close to you.
[01:40:46.436 --> 01:40:48.758]  So they're going to use them again and then make them victims again.
[01:40:49.539 --> 01:40:53.843]  Because they're able to spread the diseases quickly, and they act basically as a
[01:40:55.530 --> 01:40:55.931]  One group.
[01:40:56.271 --> 01:41:00.094]  I'm not saying all of them, but 90% will basically do whatever they're told.
[01:41:00.535 --> 01:41:11.645]  So the leader of the White House response, the medical doctor, is all over the internet basically saying, have unprotected sex and do all this crazy stuff.
[01:41:13.407 --> 01:41:17.410]  And then he is the one up there saying, this is not a gay disease.
[01:41:18.792 --> 01:41:19.032]  All right?
[01:41:20.805 --> 01:41:23.967]  So again, that short video is for television.
[01:41:24.027 --> 01:41:25.669]  It's got all the documents in it for radio.
[01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:28.911]  You just basically heard some music for 45 seconds or 48 seconds.
[01:41:29.231 --> 01:41:31.213]  You need to go to Real Alex Jones for your radio listener.
[01:41:31.613 --> 01:41:34.155]  Just at Real Alex Jones on X. You need to follow us there.
[01:41:34.175 --> 01:41:38.478]  You need to get this report, and we're going to be posting this report tonight.
[01:41:38.518 --> 01:41:41.340]  It's live right now to Real Alex Jones and Band dot video.
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:44.422]  You need to share with everybody you know, because it's all happening right now.
[01:41:44.842 --> 01:41:45.963]  Also, pull up some of the headlines.
[01:41:45.983 --> 01:41:47.564]  It's all over X. Just ask the question.
[01:41:48.845 --> 01:41:49.366]  Formerly Twitter.
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:52.601]  How are children getting monkey pox?
[01:41:53.241 --> 01:41:54.022]  Babies are getting it.
[01:41:55.542 --> 01:41:57.383]  Ibbits being spread only by sex.
[01:41:58.023 --> 01:41:58.744]  And that's a fact.
[01:42:00.284 --> 01:42:05.407]  I mean, I guess if you had, like, bit your tongue and came up and spit in somebody's mouth, maybe.
[01:42:05.847 --> 01:42:07.488]  But it's intense contact.
[01:42:08.396 --> 01:42:11.419]  And pull up the photos of homosexual men with monkey pox.
[01:42:11.799 --> 01:42:15.082]  We were shown it two years ago with the monkey pox all over their mouths.
[01:42:15.682 --> 01:42:18.965]  There's photos, medical photos of their genitals and stuff, but don't show that.
[01:42:19.025 --> 01:42:22.749]  Just show the medical photos of gay men.
[01:42:22.789 --> 01:42:23.709]  We won't say homosexual.
[01:42:24.210 --> 01:42:26.392]  That's just a technical scientific term, like heterosexual.
[01:42:26.772 --> 01:42:33.258]  Just go to Google or any other search engine and just say gay men with monkey pox.
[01:42:33.638 --> 01:42:37.282]  And it shows it all over their mouths, all the big sores, all the rest of it.
[01:42:37.702 --> 01:42:38.363]  And that's almost 100%.
[01:42:38.403 --> 01:42:44.028]  I just showed you the UN's own studies, the CDC's own studies, the NIH, all of it.
[01:42:44.369 --> 01:42:49.254]  And then now they're telling you it's imminently going to come hit you all and attack you all and
[01:42:49.654 --> 01:42:54.516]  That it's your fault and you're going to have to take shots and take new experimental vaccines.
[01:42:54.536 --> 01:42:58.297]  We're going to have lockdowns and mail-in ballots and it's a UN global emergency.
[01:42:58.698 --> 01:43:03.800]  And the same guy, Fauci, used gay men to spread HIV starting in 1979.
[01:43:07.179 --> 01:43:09.401]  Since we didn't have it, I'm going to have Matt in post.
[01:43:09.461 --> 01:43:12.503]  We post this to Band Up Video and X because I don't kind of like that.
[01:43:13.484 --> 01:43:19.508]  And we will get that out and put that out and show you because this is a very important report that we're putting out.
[01:43:19.528 --> 01:43:22.851]  This is a real emergency for everybody because they're going to try this again.
[01:43:22.871 --> 01:43:24.552]  They want to take out our food supply.
[01:43:27.274 --> 01:43:33.099]  They want to take out using the bird flu.
[01:43:35.506 --> 01:43:41.167]  And they want to just absolutely devastate everything with this monkeypox, and God knows what else they're going to hit us with.
[01:43:41.847 --> 01:43:43.227]  All right, Chase Geyser's coming up.
