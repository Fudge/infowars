[00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.659]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:40.950]  It is Tuesday, December 17th, 2024. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:50.810]  At the bottom of the hour, I am filing a massive report on the fact that the deep state has tried to push this UAP UFO invasion garbage.
[00:00:50.990 --> 00:01:00.490]  Trump came out and destroyed it yesterday, echoed my exact analysis about what's happening, but did say he could be in danger from them, and that's our intel as well.
[00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.270]  But their whole PSYOP is falling apart.
[00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:12.109]  To tell the different angles in a detailed lengthy report that is being completed right now will air at 33 after in 33 minutes from now.
[00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.510]  So be sure and stay with us for that.
[00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.329]  The whole globalist house of cards is falling.
[00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.430]  The dictator Trudeau is on his way out in Canada.
[00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.489]  Globalists are in trouble everywhere.
[00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:23.609]  This is an amazing time to be alive.
[00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.409]  But the bottom line is Trump trump their garbage by going public.
[00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.689]  Trump trump their garbage by going public.
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.219]  Coming right out!
[00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.250]  In their face and saying, you know what it is.
[00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.909]  You're lying.
[00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.709]  I've been briefed on this and we're exposing you.
[00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:46.430]  But this shows how incredibly desperate these people are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:57.689]  And it has been you, the audience of this broadcast, that have been the number one source and force pushing the truth out and exposing what has really happened here in the last few weeks.
[00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.290]  So great job.
[00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.950]  We'll continue to expose all their operations.
[00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:01.609]  Huge broadcast today.
[00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:02.469]  Stay with us.
[00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:09.270]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host today on The Alex Jones Show.
[00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.569]  We've got groundbreaking news and analysis, as always, on InfoWars.
[00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.849]  And thanks to your support at the AlexJonesStore.com, this is all possible.
[00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.669]  A couple of incredible guests coming up.
[00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.650]  Ian Carroll will be joining us at noon, and at 1 o'clock we've got Tom Sawyer joining us.
[00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:45.789]  We're going to do a bunch of analysis on the mysterious death of an open AI whistleblower, as well as some of the J6 investigation that Ian Carroll has done and we are going to be asking Tom Sawyer about his experience with explosives and explosive detection to see if it ties into these drones that we've seen flying all over the country and frankly the world for that matter the last couple of weeks.
[00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.129]  But Alex is absolutely correct and I'm not just saying that because I work for him.
[00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:51.669]  I wouldn't say it if I didn't believe it.
[00:02:52.689 --> 00:03:02.120]  In his analysis that The globalist leftist house of cards is collapsing right before our eyes, and that makes them even more of a threat, even more dangerous.
[00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:18.719]  And we've seen countless examples of analysis of the Ukraine and Russia conflict, for example, where experts from Russia and outside of Russia alike have said that if we back Russia into a corner where the only way that they can win is by using nuclear weapons,
[00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.039]  then of course that's what they're going to do.
[00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.219]  I mean, if they're going to lose everything, then they're going to resort to the last resort by definition.
[00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:26.150]  Nuclear war.
[00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:35.210]  But the same concept, the same principle applies to the mainstream media, to the globalists, to the leftists, to the establishment political class.
[00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:48.129]  We are now in a position where this political class is so vulnerable because of our landslide victory in November, because of these nominations that seem like they're going to actually go through for the Trump administration.
[00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.330]  That their vulnerability is palpable.
[00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:53.909]  You can almost taste it on the air.
[00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.330]  You can almost smell it.
[00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:09.949]  And it is activating the genetic archive in their minds and their collective consciousness to engage in desperate measures, whether it's assassination attempts, whether it's false flag attempts.
[00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:22.529]  Whether it's lawfare or subversion, I mean, I've said before on air that the best way to beat those who conspire against us is to fight back on the conspiracy battlefield, to conspire against them, to counter-conspire.
[00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:31.790]  Like with the Elon Musks and the Doges and other influencers who were absolutely pivotal in this victory in November have done.
[00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.670]  And now they are weaponizing their bootstrap mentality, these leftists, the globalists.
[00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:49.189]  They are weaponizing their creative, subversive strategies and tactics and about to employ them and unleash them, not just on their political opponents, but on humanity itself.
[00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.110]  Folks, stay with us for more breaking news right on the other side of this break.
[00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.209]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.670]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host today.
[00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:04.360]  And for some of tomorrow, Owen Schroer will be hosting The Alex Jones Show At the end of the week, Alex Jones will be back in studio on Sunday, I believe.
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.220]  We've got groundbreaking reports from Alex coming at the bottom of the hour.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.000]  He's sending reports.
[00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.779]  He's the type of person who can't stop working even when he's away.
[00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.949]  We're good to go.
[00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:42.990]  And it's not just a hyperbolic expression.
[00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:51.389]  It's not just a play on the famous television series with Kevin Spacey about the political landscape and how it really is a house of cards.
[00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.009]  It's absolutely true.
[00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:58.790]  They have built and built and built this house of cards over decades and decades all on lies.
[00:05:59.329 --> 00:06:13.600]  All on blackmail and collateral and coercion and media manipulation and fiat currency and finally This House of Cards is about to collapse if it hasn't already collapsed.
[00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:14.759]  If it hasn't already started.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.819]  We've got reports now that Trudeau is mercilessly heckled as the government implodes.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:31.399]  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was mercilessly heckled on Monday after a Liberal Party fundraiser at the Canadian Museum of History as his administration teeters on the verge of collapse.
[00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:33.040]  Other headlines.
[00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:33.800]  You're done, Trudeau.
[00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:34.800]  Mercilessly heckled.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:44.990]  And we've got Reports of leadership all throughout his administration, resigning other political leaders in Canada, calling for his resignation.
[00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.709]  And even Canadian television is reporting that he is seriously considering a resignation.
[00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:52.110]  And it's about time.
[00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.449]  I mean, he's one of the least popular leaders I've ever seen in my entire life.
[00:06:55.509 --> 00:07:02.350]  And the Canadian government system is so screwed up where you can get into a position of leadership or power without the majority of support.
[00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:09.000]  And even more Unbalanced way than, say, critics of the Electoral College.
[00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:15.879]  But what we see is a global populist awakening.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:32.019]  There is a realization worldwide that those among the political class, within the political class, who have advocated for globalist policies, whether it's economic interdependence, organizations like the World Economic Forum, the International Monetary Fund,
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:48.319]  UN or NATO, It's becoming abundantly obvious that the members of the political class who advocate for this globalism have been selling out the interests of their own constituents for the sake of conglomerating power and bolstering their hold on that political power worldwide.
[00:07:49.279 --> 00:08:14.259]  We have political leaders of the world, of Western civilization, who instead of competing with one another as political leaders used to hundreds of years ago or thousands of years ago, I figured out that a much more efficient approach than competing with one another and fighting with one another is to conspire together against the interests of their constituents,
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.199]  against the interests of the people that hold them accountable.
[00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:26.879]  And the more powerful governments become, and the more corrupt they become, then the more populist the people become, the various constituents become.
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:41.320]  And what we're seeing now, whether it's in Italy or in Canada or in Mexico or in Germany or anywhere else notable throughout the world, is a massive populist awakening.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.220]  And it is terrifying, the political class.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:49.480]  Because for the first time in decades, the foundation they have built their house of cards on is shaking.
[00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:51.580]  It's collapsing right beneath them.
[00:08:53.179 --> 00:09:09.919]  And they have weaponized everything they possibly can in order to mitigate this risk, whether it's their control over the media, whether it's their control over their various judicial systems, the weaponization of lawfare, the political persecution of political dissidents,
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.559]  whether they're Jay Sixers or Julian Assange or Edward Snowden or others.
[00:09:16.019 --> 00:09:22.159]  But it simply hasn't been enough because the truth itself is too big to rig.
[00:09:23.289 --> 00:09:43.649]  And I know there hasn't been a lot of coverage since the 5th of November about the Democratic attempts to cheat in our own election, our presidential election, because after all we did win and we were so excited that we won that we didn't really put the enemy to the fire in terms of Their corruption and attempts to seal this election.
[00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:49.149]  In 2016, after Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton, he said that they cheated in a big way in 2016. It was too big to rig.
[00:09:49.429 --> 00:09:50.809]  2020, obviously, they cheated.
[00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.370]  And in 2024, they cheated too.
[00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:58.950]  There were hundreds of thousands of ballots coming in, places like Detroit at 4 a.m., but it was simply too big to rig.
[00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:08.529]  And so we have this political establishment which has the infrastructure in place to conspire.
[00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.490]  They have the infrastructure in place to engage in psychological operations.
[00:10:12.669 --> 00:10:19.070]  They have the infrastructure in place to manipulate the masses, instigate false flags.
[00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:26.490]  So many weapons at their disposal, but it was still too big to rig.
[00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.190]  Now they're going to activate every single tool they have.
[00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:41.860]  I'm sure you remember, I certainly remember what happened in 2016. Donald Trump won the election, we thought everything was gonna be fine, and then all hell broke loose.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:50.600]  There was impeachment after impeachment, prosecution after prosecution, sabotage after sabotage, subversion after subversion in the administration.
[00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:58.799]  John McCain literally rolling in on a wheelchair after brain surgery to sabotage Trump's healthcare reform.
[00:11:00.029 --> 00:11:16.070]  We saw the political class of the world intentionally manufacture a coronavirus and then allow it to leak throughout the world for the sole purpose of empowering Big Pharma and undermining the integrity of his election or the likelihood that he would win.
[00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.549]  The economy was so good.
[00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.490]  Everything was doing so well.
[00:11:19.789 --> 00:11:22.190]  Theo Vaughn famously said, my cousin got a boat during that.
[00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.529]  That they knew that the only way to beat Donald Trump was to undermine the strength of the economy.
[00:11:27.669 --> 00:11:29.789]  And the best way to do that, well, that's to shut down the world.
[00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:32.590]  Two weeks to slow the spread ended up being months and months.
[00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.570]  Masks and masks and vaccines and vaccines.
[00:11:35.309 --> 00:11:36.389]  Regulation after regulation.
[00:11:37.649 --> 00:11:40.309]  Hundreds of thousands of businesses shut down.
[00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.409]  While all the big name brands came in and bought everything up.
[00:11:45.529 --> 00:11:50.850]  And then the wealthy class benefited from the massive inflation of the money that had to be printed.
[00:11:53.690 --> 00:12:13.289]  But we saw what the subversion looked like between 2016 and 2020. And I'm telling you right now, the leftists, the globalists, the members of our political establishment are hardly less powerful than they were in 2016 when they undermined an entire four years of an administration.
[00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:21.929]  They are some less powerful because they don't have the support of the people in the same way that they did in 2016. Barack Obama, he's an evil man.
[00:12:22.649 --> 00:12:24.250]  Abundantly popular politician.
[00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:40.129]  So going into the Trump administration, there was this leftist momentum of the Obama acolytes that supported these institutions and enabled this political class or these political enemies of American interests to do the things that they did and get away with it.
[00:12:40.289 --> 00:12:48.370]  I mean, we have reports now that Liz Cheney and the January 6th committee are destroying documents like the Nazis when they were in retreat.
[00:12:49.379 --> 00:12:51.919]  As Russia advanced, as the United States advanced against them.
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:03.580]  But the point is, they may be weaker than they were in 2016, but it's like 5% weaker, 10% weaker.
[00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:15.299]  And all of the same tools, weapons, strategies, and tactics that they employed in 2016 against the Trump administration and the interests of the American people, they are going to employ over the course of the next four years.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.000]  Now I think Trump is wiser and more experienced this time.
[00:13:18.159 --> 00:13:21.659]  He has the benefit of having been the President of the United States before this time.
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.039]  So he's got more experience.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.740]  He understands that he was surrounded by bad people in the first term.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.700]  I mean, he even admits it.
[00:13:28.679 --> 00:13:31.120]  And now everyone's acting like they want to work with him.
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.539]  I'm going to show clip five in a second here.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.399]  But I'm telling you, some of these people are subversive and he knows that.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.279]  He understands that.
[00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:43.240]  But they're still gonna do things like false flags.
[00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:47.379]  They're even bragging now that they're gonna release a virus the day after he's inaugurated.
[00:13:47.539 --> 00:13:51.200]  We've got bowtie experts going on major media outlets.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:14:00.320]  Well, they're not really major anymore, but legacy media outlets listing a litany of viruses that are gonna be released on January 21st.
[00:14:01.609 --> 00:14:05.649]  Hemorrhagic fevers and things of that nature, all sorts of disgusting things, terrible things, terrifying things.
[00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:10.129]  So they want to redo what happened with the coronavirus again.
[00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:13.590]  But at the beginning of this administration, instead of the end of it, because they don't need to undermine an election.
[00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.210]  This is his last term, no matter what.
[00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.450]  So now they have to undermine the administration.
[00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:24.389]  So they're mentioning that they're trying to escalate to World War III. We have Joe Biden literally selling the border wall off.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:36.580]  So that people can continue to flood into the United States illegally, all while there are rumors of a Soviet-era-era dirty bomb in the United States.
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:46.480]  Why would you make the border more permeable when there are missing nukes that are rumored to be in the tri-state area as thousands of drones scour the area?
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.840]  Let's show clip number five.
[00:14:57.189 --> 00:15:00.210]  I did have dinner with Tim Cook.
[00:15:00.929 --> 00:15:05.129]  I had dinner with sort of almost all of them and the rest are coming.
[00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:16.320]  And this is one of the big differences I think between, we were talking about it before, One of the big differences between the first term, the first term everybody was fighting me.
[00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:18.899]  In this term, everybody wants to be my friend.
[00:15:19.059 --> 00:15:19.419]  I don't know.
[00:15:19.659 --> 00:15:23.740]  My personality changed or something, but- Yeah.
[00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:28.639]  So everyone's acting like they want to be his friend because they understand that the people back him now.
[00:15:29.139 --> 00:15:31.820]  It's now popular to back Donald Trump.
[00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:37.059]  After he absolutely murdered Joe Biden in the June 27th debate, I believe it was.
[00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.210]  Forcing Joe Biden to withdraw from the race.
[00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:44.590]  I mean, there was a coup against him, but ultimately that performance of that debate was the reason that he was couped against.
[00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:56.570]  And the historic moment when he stood up and said, fight, fight, fight, that was the permission slip for the technocratic class to come out and endorse and support Donald Trump.
[00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:06.889]  When you have the Mark Zuckerbergs, who are known to have funded millions upon millions of dollars to see to it that Trump wouldn't be elected in 2020, coming out and saying, that was so badass.
[00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:15.710]  Making statements saying that he wants a place on this administration and a tech advisory role.
[00:16:16.889 --> 00:16:18.289]  Suddenly, everybody's your friend.
[00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.230]  It's like when you win the lottery and everybody suddenly comes back into your life.
[00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.929]  They want a piece of this, a piece of that.
[00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.529]  But not all of these people who are approaching Donald Trump are friends.
[00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:34.470]  Some of them may even think that they're friends, but they're not because they're actually Warhawks, the Sebastian Gorkas and others.
[00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:40.700]  I know that Sebastian Gorka was given a place and an advisory role in the administration.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.320]  I don't think he has any real power, thank God.
[00:16:43.539 --> 00:16:51.200]  But right now we are witnessing a schism within the Republican Party where it's the neocons versus the MAGA populists.
[00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:58.159]  It's the rats, the Republicans against Trump versus MAGA. And MAGA is going to win.
[00:16:58.259 --> 00:17:01.519]  I mean, even Mitt Romney came out and said the Republican Party is the MAGA Party.
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:06.910]  Now they are conceding defeat in terms of Popular perspective.
[00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:08.670]  Public relations.
[00:17:11.049 --> 00:17:12.690]  I'm going to show clip number two here in a second.
[00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:17.390]  Because what Trump did in this last campaign, and I don't think it could have been possible without Barron.
[00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:23.200]  Was he put the final nail in the coffin of legacy media?
[00:17:23.539 --> 00:17:26.259]  Their numbers have been going down for decades.
[00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:27.859]  Their ratings are terrible.
[00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:36.960]  There's no explanation as to why CNN has allegedly 4,000 employees when it has fewer viewers than Infowars, who has 50 employees.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:47.079]  But this was the nail in the coffin because Trump declined to appear on hardly any mainstream or legacy media platforms during this campaign.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.099]  Kamala Harris hit all of them.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.440]  You, CNN, 60 Minutes, others.
[00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.309]  And the podcasts won.
[00:17:57.529 --> 00:17:58.910]  The alternative media won.
[00:17:59.029 --> 00:18:09.170]  The Theo Vons, the Joe Rogans, the Tony Hinchcliffe's, the Alex Jones's, the Tucker Carlson's as independent influencers in the space on a free speech platform.
[00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:10.569]  It's not perfect, but it's very good.
[00:18:13.299 --> 00:18:19.980]  Have more political influence and power than these legacy outlets, and that's why they're just grasping at straws.
[00:18:20.039 --> 00:18:27.000]  I mean, they're making stuff up, they're being sued for $15 million because they defamed Donald Trump, just perpetuating these lies, but nobody's watching.
[00:18:28.299 --> 00:18:36.420]  They're still the same villains that they always have been, but it's like when the Ring of Power and Lord of the Rings is destroyed, and all of the orcs just scatter.
[00:18:38.299 --> 00:18:39.660]  They're still the same villains.
[00:18:39.819 --> 00:18:41.339]  They're still the same bad people.
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.940]  They're still the same political deep state shills and class.
[00:18:45.059 --> 00:18:48.180]  But now the ring of power has been destroyed because they have no attention.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.539]  Nobody trusts them.
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:55.680]  The perception of their power, to quote Gorbachev, was their power.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.819]  And now that perception is gone.
[00:18:59.279 --> 00:19:02.319]  They have no perceived credibility or power whatsoever.
[00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:10.680]  Nobody trusts the experts anymore because the experts have been proven time and time again to be either wrong or paid off.
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:21.700]  And they're acting in massive desperation because of this alternative media threat.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:28.720]  This is clip number two of Trump admitting basically that Barron Trump is the reason that he did the podcast and ultimately the reason in large that he won.
[00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.789]  How do you plan to stop the ban on TikTok next month?
[00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:38.789]  We'll take a look at TikTok.
[00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:44.210]  I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok because I won youth by 34 points.
[00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:50.069]  And there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that.
[00:19:50.269 --> 00:19:57.769]  Now, Joe Rogan did and Some of the other people that were recommended by my son Barron, he knew names.
[00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:58.849]  I said, who is that?
[00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.230]  Tell me, who's that?
[00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.529]  Dad, you got to be kidding.
[00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.009]  I can't believe you don't know.
[00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:06.849]  And I did those interviews and it was actually sort of cute.
[00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.029]  Do you want to know the truth?
[00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.089]  But we did them and that had an impact.
[00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:11.509]  But TikTok had an impact.
[00:20:11.769 --> 00:20:14.089]  And so we're taking a look at it.
[00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:15.549]  But, you know, we want youth.
[00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.190]  Republicans are always 30 points down in youth.
[00:20:18.309 --> 00:20:18.950]  I don't know why.
[00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:20.829]  But we ended up finishing.
[00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:27.950]  There was one poll that showed us down about 30. We were 35 or 36 points up with young people.
[00:20:28.589 --> 00:20:31.069]  So I have a little bit of a warm spot in my heart.
[00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.549]  I'll be honest.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:41.240]  The ban on TikTok has nothing to do with Chinese data harvesting.
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.759]  They say that it does.
[00:20:43.039 --> 00:20:56.259]  It has nothing to do with our political class or our deep state fearing that these algorithms are manipulating our young generations into incompetence relative to the coming generations in China or Russia or other places.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.680]  That's what they say.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:09.220]  But we know that the government doesn't care about your privacy because the government, as Edward Snowden proved, is invading your privacy constantly.
[00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:15.019]  Monitoring your email communications, your texts, your phone calls, your signal, your computer behavior, everything.
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:15.640]  All that data.
[00:21:16.119 --> 00:21:22.859]  Frankly, we're giving all of our data away voluntarily when we check the accept the terms box and create a social media account.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.539]  So they don't care about your data.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.460]  That's not why they're doing this.
[00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:38.549]  And we know that they don't care about the youth because they've instituted DEI programs in virtually every Department of Education branch at every state and local level.
[00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:55.569]  I mean, we have story after story of detransitioners coming out and saying, That it was their school counselor or their teacher that encouraged them to transition when they were 12, 13, 14. Now that they're an adult and they want to have children, they can't.
[00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:56.890]  They're bitter about it and they're suing.
[00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:04.049]  So all of the same things that our government, our leaders are accusing TikTok of doing, our own government is doing to our people.
[00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:09.430]  All the things that we accused Russia of doing to Ukraine, we did to Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:22:11.319 --> 00:22:16.599]  I can't think of a single reason why what Russia is doing to Ukraine is any worse than what we did to Iraq.
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:24.200]  Lying about weapons of mass destruction, invading the entire country, unseating a relatively stable government.
[00:22:24.759 --> 00:22:28.579]  Not a just government, not a good government, but relatively stable compared to whatever's going on now.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:47.720]  And so what's really happening is TikTok is another example of information that can go viral very quickly, oftentimes the truth, without the control of our own deep state because it's controlled by China.
[00:22:48.819 --> 00:22:57.490]  So we have virtually, at the deep state level, we have Virtually no control over what happens on this massive platform, TikTok.
[00:22:57.809 --> 00:23:04.869]  And that is why our deep state, our national security apparatus, our political class wants to ban TikTok from the United States.
[00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:10.410]  And they're just using these other things as excuses to justify this legislation, which is likely a violation of free speech.
[00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.029]  And I'm not a fan of China.
[00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.029]  I'm not a fan of the CCP. I'm not a fan of TikTok.
[00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.450]  I think it's incredibly bad for you.
[00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:28.670]  But I'm also not a fan of our government coming in and mandating that these platforms Cease to exist in the United States because they want to have a monopoly over how information is propagated.
[00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:38.349]  So with the TikTok thing Trump is talking about, I hope that he reverses it.
[00:23:38.509 --> 00:23:39.029]  I really do.
[00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:44.470]  Even though I think it's an unhealthy thing because I just don't like the precedent that it sets.
[00:23:47.130 --> 00:24:02.779]  But what we're going into now is Is a new era of information, where regardless of the platform, as long as individuals have their own audience, like Alex Jones, Tucker Carlson and others,
[00:24:03.519 --> 00:24:10.079]  the deep state no longer has a monopoly over the disbursement of information, the control of information.
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.779]  And that absolutely terrifies them.
[00:24:13.099 --> 00:24:14.740]  That's why they're attacking Elon Musk.
[00:24:14.859 --> 00:24:17.180]  That's why they tried to do everything they could to prevent him from buying acts.
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.859]  That's why they're coming after TikTok.
[00:24:20.509 --> 00:24:27.910]  That's why they're coming after individual journalists and influencers and doing everything they can to fame.
[00:24:28.369 --> 00:24:30.210]  Because it's all about a monopoly of information.
[00:24:30.609 --> 00:24:34.609]  Because if you control information and you control speech, then ultimately you can control thought.
[00:24:34.609 --> 00:24:36.910]  And if you can control thought, then you can control behavior.
[00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:40.329]  And if you can control behavior, then you have total power.
[00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.970]  Because when push comes to shove, that's all that power really is.
[00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.829]  Think about the Tom Petty song, It's Good to Be King.
[00:24:48.849 --> 00:24:57.710]  Whether you're a child or an adult, when you think about what a king is or what it means to be a king, it means that if you tell someone to do something, they will do it.
[00:24:57.809 --> 00:25:00.130]  And if you ask for something, you will get it.
[00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.769]  That's basically what power is.
[00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:03.509]  Everybody does what you say.
[00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.309]  The boss, king, whatever.
[00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:22.170]  And so that's why the control of information and speech and thought and behavior is central to the deep state's That's why there's endless, ceaseless lawfare against Infowars and Alex Jones.
[00:25:23.769 --> 00:25:26.710]  That's why they try to indict him in federal court with grand jury after grand jury.
[00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:31.890]  They can't find him guilty of any criminal charges, so they encourage plaintiffs to attack him in civil court.
[00:25:32.859 --> 00:25:37.259]  For over a billion dollars, the largest defamation judgment in the history of defamation judgments.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:45.920]  Apparently, according to our legal system, no one has talked more crap about anyone else in the history of talking crap than Alex Jones, if you quantify it monetarily speaking.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:47.980]  That's the claim.
[00:25:50.019 --> 00:25:52.759]  They're not attacking Alex Jones because of anything he got wrong.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.839]  They're attacking Alex Jones because he can't be controlled and because of the things that he gets right.
[00:25:57.059 --> 00:26:00.180]  They don't attack Tucker Carlson because of anything he gets wrong.
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.640]  They attack Tucker Carlson because they can't control him and because of the things he gets right.
[00:26:04.819 --> 00:26:08.440]  They don't attack Joe Rogan because of any of the things that Joe Rogan gets wrong.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.519]  They attack Joe Rogan because they can't control him and because of all the things that he gets right.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:27.680]  I mean, we had examples of Joe Rogan during the pandemic Talking about taking ivermectin and mainstream media outlets were putting like a sepia filter or desaturating the image of him in the video to try to make him look sickly and gaunt.
[00:26:27.819 --> 00:26:29.960]  He's one of the healthiest people that I've ever even heard of.
[00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:39.960]  And once you understand that they don't come after you because they think you've done something wrong or because you actually have done something wrong.
[00:26:40.359 --> 00:26:45.630]  Instead, they come after you Because they are the antagonist.
[00:26:45.829 --> 00:26:47.130]  They are the evil ones.
[00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:48.130]  They are the liars.
[00:26:48.289 --> 00:26:51.789]  And they're terrified of the things that you're getting right and that you're doing right.
[00:26:52.009 --> 00:26:53.730]  Then the whole paradigm shifts.
[00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:56.390]  And you have awakened.
[00:26:56.569 --> 00:26:59.049]  And it's happening to millions of people across the world.

[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.119]  Merry Christmas!
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:06.799]  Well, Admiral John Kirby and the rest of the Biden administration have done a big U-turn claiming they didn't know what the drones were.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.420]  They didn't know what the UFOs were.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.180]  They didn't know what the UAPs were.
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.279]  They didn't know for the last few weeks.
[00:30:12.339 --> 00:30:13.440]  They had no idea.
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:21.339]  But now, suddenly, they come out yesterday, hours after Trump comes out and says, the Pentagon and Biden know what they are, and they're human.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.460]  They know where they're taking off from.
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.599]  They know where they're landing.
[00:30:26.599 --> 00:30:35.640]  And he said they're doing this obviously to create fear And then within a few hours, Kirby and the Pentagon come out and say, yes, we do know what they are, they're not a threat.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:43.539]  Earlier in the week, they said, we don't know what they are, we don't know if they're human, but they're not foreign and they're not us to create all the fear, as I said.
[00:30:43.859 --> 00:30:53.180]  And on Sunday, I quote, solved the UAP UFO mystery over New Jersey and New York and said exactly what Trump then ended up saying yesterday afternoon.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.940]  In that press conference, he was asked, have you been briefed on this?
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.160]  He said, I'm not gonna answer that question.
[00:30:57.619 --> 00:30:58.799]  Obviously, he has.
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.319]  We can look at these and know that they're man-made.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.500]  But here's the key to how we know that Kirby's still telling lies, though.
[00:31:04.799 --> 00:31:09.480]  He's come clean on a lot because of the pressure, because Trump called their bluff at 32 days before he gets in office.
[00:31:10.119 --> 00:31:18.779]  The big takeaway is that they've been harassing military bases, including nuke bases, all over the country, not just New Jersey and New York.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.480]  And the military is compartmentalized.
[00:31:20.619 --> 00:31:27.099]  They're not being told what Space Command and NORTHCOM and these other private corporations are doing.
[00:31:27.849 --> 00:31:32.150]  Like the Skunk Works, like Lockheed Martin and all these other groups.
[00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:47.670]  So this is a major psyop, as I said weeks ago, ahead of Trump getting into office to create fear, a political distraction from all the pardons and the corruption and the human trafficking and the big Coca-Cola truck they just caught with a bunch of little kids in it, Chicago being smuggled into the country.
[00:31:48.369 --> 00:31:57.650]  This is a giant smokescreen, and it could also be a smokescreen for detonating a dirty bomb or a nuke, and then trying to destabilize the incoming Trump administration, declare a national emergency.
[00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:05.930]  It's also in the COG laws in 2007 that Cheney put in, that they can bring in basically martial law type scenarios.
[00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:10.130]  If there is some type of UAP big event, that they don't know what it is.
[00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:15.490]  But we've caught them, the public doesn't believe a word they say, and Trump calling their bluff just destroyed them.
[00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:17.049]  I'm about to break more down right now.
[00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:20.190]  Can you comment on the drones that are flying around?
[00:32:21.589 --> 00:32:26.490]  The government knows what is happening.
[00:32:27.569 --> 00:32:31.769]  Look, our military knows where they took off from.
[00:32:32.609 --> 00:32:35.329]  If it's a garage, they can go right into that garage.
[00:32:35.589 --> 00:32:38.289]  They know where it came from and where it went.
[00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.329]  And for some reason they don't want to comment.
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.180]  And I think they'd be better off saying what it is.
[00:32:44.299 --> 00:32:46.880]  Our military knows and our president knows.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.200]  And for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.859]  I can't imagine it's the enemy, because if it was the enemy, they'd blast it out.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.640]  Even if they were late, they'd blast it.
[00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:06.009]  Something strange is going on for some reason they don't want to tell the people and they should because the people are really, I mean they happen to be over Bedminster.
[00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:10.930]  They're very close to Bedminster.
[00:33:11.109 --> 00:33:13.150]  I think maybe I won't spend the weekend in Bedminster.
[00:33:13.589 --> 00:33:15.750]  I've decided to cancel my trip.
[00:33:16.309 --> 00:33:18.170]  Have you received an intelligence briefing on the drones?
[00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.890]  I don't want to comment on that.
[00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:24.789]  Did you just catch what Trump said there at the end?
[00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:39.230]  He's not gonna be going anytime soon to his New Jersey golf course and resort, because that is one of the main places these sophisticated, obviously, military drones have been harassing.
[00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:56.069]  And they're harassing military bases, so the bases report, and so they can release the Audio-radio chatter, on purpose, because they want the public to have that, that the bases themselves have no idea what's going on, and they're being told by the higher-ups, we're not allowed to shoot them down, and we don't know what they are.
[00:33:56.230 --> 00:34:07.079]  Again, all of this deliberately to terrorize the public and create a real-life War of the Worlds, just like Orson Welles did back in the 1930s.
[00:34:07.119 --> 00:34:09.280]  This is a psychological operation.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:15.059]  Now, here's some of what Kirby, Admiral Kirby, had to say on Fox News last night.
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.940]  You hear all of these officials.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.820]  You've heard a lot of concern, a lot of coverage.
[00:34:20.079 --> 00:34:22.239]  Where are you tonight on this?
[00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:38.230]  As we look at the information we've got, Brett, and we've now examined some 5,000 different sightings, we've added detection capabilities, additional observers, as you and I stand here today, to date, our assessment is that this is lawful,
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:44.340]  Legal, commercial, hobbyist, and even law enforcement aircraft activity.
[00:34:44.519 --> 00:34:46.780]  Some of it's manned, some of it's unmanned.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:53.179]  We absolutely acknowledge that a lot of these are probably drones, but they're flying legally.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:35:05.079]  And it is legal to fly drones in non-restricted airspace as long as you're registered with the FAA. And there's thousands and thousands of these kinds of flights every single day.
[00:35:05.159 --> 00:35:10.280]  I think there's more than a million Drones that are registered with the FAA just in the United States alone.
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.460]  But this is different, it seems.
[00:35:12.739 --> 00:35:13.340]  These are bigger.
[00:35:13.519 --> 00:35:16.099]  They're six feet in diameter, a lot of them.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:21.699]  There was a reporter the other day that saw 50 coming from the coast at one, like, pack.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:26.039]  I know when you first came out, you said that most of these are manned.
[00:35:26.219 --> 00:35:29.099]  Can you concede that maybe most of these are not manned?
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:37.400]  What I said was at the time, and this was Thursday, when we were not as informed as we are today based on the resources we have applied to the problem side.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.400]  I said many of the reported sightings we believe to be manned aircraft.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.599]  That was true when we said it on Thursday.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:55.360]  We still believe, Brett, that some of these are, in fact, I couldn't give you a breakdown of what percentage, but we do believe that still some of these sightings are in fact manned aircraft.
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:59.099]  We also acknowledge that a lot of them are unmanned aircraft.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:09.059]  But again, our assessment to date, given all the work that we've done, the FBI, state and local officials, that these are legal and lawful drones flying for the common good.
[00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:17.030]  Okay, the Homeland Security Secretary said over the weekend that right now they don't have any foreign involvement, criminal activity, we don't see them as a national security concern.
[00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:18.769]  How can you get to that point?
[00:36:18.989 --> 00:36:22.269]  How can you get to that conclusion with what you're seeing?
[00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:24.550]  Because we've done the analysis.
[00:36:24.909 --> 00:36:26.630]  We've done the detection and the analysis.
[00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:28.130]  We've corroborated the sightings.
[00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:35.869]  And in every case that we have examined to date, we have seen nothing, nothing, that indicates a public safety risk.
[00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:40.550]  There are drones flying over the skies of the United States every single night, every single day.
[00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:48.489]  And we've seen nothing in and around New Jersey that should give The people on the ground there are concerns for their safety for this activity.
[00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:59.369]  And we've seen nothing working with the Department of Defense, as well, that indicates a foreign adversary actor involved or any kind of pernicious national security threat.
[00:36:59.489 --> 00:37:03.909]  Now, there have been some drone sightings, I think, as you know, over some military bases.
[00:37:04.489 --> 00:37:05.969]  We're obviously looking at that.
[00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:10.070]  That is a different category, and DOD has different authorities to deal with that.
[00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:17.090]  But again, we've also seen no disruption Of operations at our bases in New Jersey either from any of this.
[00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:19.309]  Okay, here is the president-elect today.
[00:37:20.969 --> 00:37:24.090]  They know where it came from and where it went.
[00:37:24.989 --> 00:37:27.150]  And for some reason they don't want to comment.
[00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.969]  And I think they'd be better off saying what it is.
[00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.650]  Our military knows and our president knows.
[00:37:33.429 --> 00:37:36.050]  And for some reason they want to keep people in suspense.
[00:37:38.389 --> 00:37:39.449]  What's your answer to that?
[00:37:39.929 --> 00:37:42.989]  Well, I think it goes back to the first question you asked me, Brett.
[00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:51.170]  I mean, we have made an assessment based on the work we've done thus far, and our assessment is that this is lawful and legal activity, whether it's manned or unmanned.
[00:37:51.429 --> 00:37:54.429]  Again, we see no indication of a national security or public safety risk.
[00:37:54.429 --> 00:37:55.989]  Okay, but there are so many of them, John.
[00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:57.150]  There are so many of them, John.
[00:37:57.449 --> 00:38:02.710]  You don't see any linkage between the number that this is all tied together in one thing.
[00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:11.889]  You think these are all different elements and different kinds of drones, not with one company, not with the military, not with the DOE, Department of Energy.
[00:38:11.889 --> 00:38:14.510]  You don't say that they're looking for some nuclear material.
[00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:19.530]  You say these are all different flying objects, some of them manned, some not.
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:31.820]  Our assessment to date is that, Brett, that this is a collection of law enforcement, hobbyists, commercial drones, and of course, civil aviation aircraft that have caused all these sightings.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.639]  And it's not attributable to an actor for a purpose.
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:41.300]  And again, I want to stress to your viewers, we don't see anything that indicates a national security or a public safety threat.
[00:38:41.579 --> 00:38:46.119]  The last thing I'll say, Brett, and I appreciate the time you're giving me, is this is an ongoing investigation.
[00:38:46.219 --> 00:38:47.820]  We're still working our way through this.
[00:38:48.579 --> 00:38:49.900]  Sightings continue to come in.
[00:38:50.039 --> 00:38:52.599]  We've taken them all seriously, and we'll continue to look at this.
[00:38:52.719 --> 00:39:00.599]  And if we learn more, if we know more, certainly if we find something that's contradictory to what we believe today, I'll be right up here on your show talking about it.
[00:39:00.719 --> 00:39:02.380]  And we will have you on right away.
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:03.820]  John, we appreciate the time.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.820]  Something strange is going on.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:12.030]  For some reason, they don't want to tell the people, and they should, because the people are really I mean, they happen to be over Bedminster.
[00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:16.949]  They're very close to Bedminster.
[00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:19.170]  I think maybe I won't spend the weekend in Bedminster.
[00:39:19.969 --> 00:39:21.769]  I've decided to cancel my trip.
[00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.210]  Have you received an intelligence briefing on the drones?
[00:39:24.909 --> 00:39:27.929]  The last thing Trump just said there is not getting the attention it deserves.
[00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:38.690]  Here is the embattled incoming president saying, yes, I'm not going to be going to my resort golf course anytime soon because we see this as a security threat.
[00:39:39.409 --> 00:39:53.550]  That is the president saying, he's obviously been brief, that these are a security threat, but then we've got the Pentagon saying they know who it is and it's not a threat after they told the public that they didn't know who it was.
[00:39:54.170 --> 00:40:08.070]  This is a major, major scandal, and this is the Biden administration, the deep state, like the Wizard of Oz, the man behind the curtain, I am the mighty, powerful Oz, trying to psyop the American people, the people of the world.
[00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.610]  At the same time, they try to escalate to full nuclear war with Russia.
[00:40:11.889 --> 00:40:16.409]  At the same time, they continue to roll out economic policies that destroy the nation.
[00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:22.090]  Now, new numbers came out today that all the Biden job numbers were all fake, as we told you they were.
[00:40:22.849 --> 00:40:27.730]  This is just a bunch of scammers, and all they've got is magician tricks.
[00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.050]  All they've got is psychological warfare.
[00:40:30.369 --> 00:40:38.409]  Now, here's one of the famous Women that was on Real New York Housewives talking about, she talked to this guy whose dad was in this and they're really concerned.
[00:40:38.489 --> 00:40:39.869]  They think they're looking for nuclear material.
[00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:44.829]  I know everybody's obsessed with this and sure there's elevated radiation levels in those areas of New Jersey and New York.
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:49.940]  That happens all the time because there's so much nuclear material in the area, x-ray machines, you name it.
[00:40:50.699 --> 00:40:57.360]  But the larger point here is that you don't use drones to actually find radioactive material.
[00:40:57.679 --> 00:41:05.800]  They've got ground sensors, they've got trucks, they've got scanners, and those things weigh so much that they don't really work on small flying platforms.
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:12.480]  So this whole radiation thing is a cover, as I told you over a week ago, for the larger PSYOP operation.
[00:41:12.559 --> 00:41:14.000]  Okay, it's a secret government operation.
[00:41:14.159 --> 00:41:16.079]  We're trying to keep you safe from nukes.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.239]  Here is the New York Housewives lady.
[00:41:18.639 --> 00:41:21.860]  You're gonna think I'm nuts, but why should today be any different than any other day?
[00:41:22.039 --> 00:41:41.070]  I know this guy whose father worked with the Pentagon and NASA and secret projects, and he has been messaging me That he will never forgive himself if he doesn't tell the people that he knows that for a month he's been watching this situation and now,
[00:41:41.510 --> 00:42:11.510]  several days ago before it became a discussion in the mainstream media, that these drones are ours and that they could very possibly be sniffing out something very dangerous, some missing Dangerous W from the war and that areas that coincide with where the drones have been seen have spiked in radiation.
[00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:20.460]  So he said it's time to think about where I am and that I might want to We're good to go somewhere with my daughter.
[00:42:21.139 --> 00:42:26.099]  So like for me, you know, we blow things off and we think nothing's going to happen, but things do happen.
[00:42:26.239 --> 00:42:33.300]  I remember sitting in my car with my driver who said to me months before I even knew what the words global pandemic meant, I think there's going to be a global pandemic.
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:34.420]  I'm like, what are you talking about?
[00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:36.679]  I mean, if he had bet the markets, he would have been a billionaire.
[00:42:37.099 --> 00:42:39.900]  So I'm just listening to this guy and watching.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:47.590]  And now Trump, who's hanging out with a lot of Billionaires who have a lot of money for research is also finding out that these are ours.
[00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:50.130]  And what were the government's choices?
[00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:55.690]  A, tell us that that's what they're doing and widespread panic and pandemonium.
[00:42:55.909 --> 00:42:57.510]  Or B, do what they're doing.
[00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:02.289]  But something is wrong because otherwise they would eliminate them and everyone's being very cagey.
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.079]  What do you think?
[00:43:04.539 --> 00:43:13.059]  This guy has also been talking to different people in government positions who agree and are watching now.
[00:43:13.679 --> 00:43:16.320]  The moral of the story is President Trump got ahead of this.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:24.619]  He exposed it yesterday afternoon and within hours, the establishment did a 180, except on the issue of the military bases being harassed.
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:32.329]  Now if they know who's doing it and it's legal and it's not a problem, and days before they said they didn't know who it was, But it wasn't a threat.
[00:43:32.849 --> 00:43:38.250]  Now they know who it is, lied to us, but still say it's not a threat, then who's harassing the military bases?
[00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:41.130]  Right there in New Jersey and New York, and all over the country.
[00:43:41.429 --> 00:43:42.989]  Now the PSYOP is continuing.
[00:43:43.469 --> 00:43:49.789]  I put out an emergency report, as you know, on Friday to President Trump, saying we know where they're taking off, we know where they're landing, that is the Pentagon does.
[00:43:50.329 --> 00:43:56.050]  Get briefed on this, get out ahead of it, expose it, it's a major PSYOP. He did that, and now their fraud is collapsing.
[00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:58.030]  Trump needs to call for an investigation.
[00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:02.449]  He needs to have an investigation once he gets in in 32 days to expose this fraud as well.
[00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:05.570]  But great job to the viewers and listeners for boosting all reports on this.
[00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:06.650]  This is an information war.
[00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:10.650]  Truth trumps lies every time, pun intended.
[00:44:10.949 --> 00:44:12.190]  So God bless you all.
[00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:14.409]  Infowars is truly tomorrow's news today.
[00:44:14.809 --> 00:44:16.750]  Follow me on X at Real Alex Jones.
[00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:17.329]  God bless.
[00:44:17.429 --> 00:44:24.949]  And we'll be unpacking more analysis about these drones, the nuclear stuff, everything that's going on with Ian Carroll when he joins us at the top of the hour.
[00:44:26.469 --> 00:44:35.289]  But I want to talk again about Justin Trudeau's imminent resignation because It's relevant to us.
[00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:39.610]  And typically speaking, I don't really care for foreign news.
[00:44:39.789 --> 00:44:44.349]  I typically am not interested in what's happening anywhere else in the world except for the United States.
[00:44:44.489 --> 00:44:45.530]  I'm an America first person.
[00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:49.590]  And so I'm not concerned with issues and policies of other nations.
[00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:57.909]  But we are so entrenched in all these nations because of our globalist political class that what happens to Justin Trudeau becomes relevant.
[00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:59.829]  Who Italy elects becomes relevant.
[00:44:59.969 --> 00:45:01.789]  Who Germany elects becomes relevant.
[00:45:01.929 --> 00:45:03.409]  Who Mexico elects becomes relevant.
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:12.440]  And Canada is like our Marxist little brother, our irritating Marxist little brother.
[00:45:12.619 --> 00:45:13.760]  We're like Abel.
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:14.619]  They're like Cain.
[00:45:14.739 --> 00:45:18.719]  They envy us because we're favored and more prosperous and successful and better off.
[00:45:19.699 --> 00:45:29.320]  And what happens in Canada is foreshadowing for what could happen in the United States if we fall prey to the World Economic Forum's and others.
[00:45:30.849 --> 00:45:41.969]  And so it's important that we understand and analyze this imminent resignation from Justin Trudeau because it's indicative of a zeitgeist, a spirit of the times that's propagating across the entire planet.
[00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:51.449]  Let's run clip number B. It says here, Kyle Becker reported, if you want to know why Justin Trudeau is on the verge of resigning as Canada's prime minister, this woman says it all in just 22 seconds.
[00:45:52.289 --> 00:45:54.489]  You've sold us out to globalism.
[00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:56.909]  You are not working for Canada.
[00:45:57.269 --> 00:46:00.389]  You are working for your globalist partners.
[00:46:00.389 --> 00:46:03.829]  I wonder how much they're paying you to betray Canada.
[00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:07.250]  What do we do with traitors in Canada, Mr. Trudeau?
[00:46:07.409 --> 00:46:08.550]  We used to hang them.
[00:46:08.869 --> 00:46:10.269]  Hang them for treason.
[00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:14.070]  And you're doing that very same thing to us now.
[00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:36.320]  And we've got another This is clip A. King Trudeau,
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.800]  what gives you the right to continue?
[00:46:38.079 --> 00:46:39.960]  What gives you the right to stay in office?
[00:46:40.539 --> 00:46:41.920]  You failed Canada.
[00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:43.480]  You've ruined our country.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:44.619]  You're done.
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:45.639]  Walk away.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.719]  You don't have an ounce of your father's integrity.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.059]  At least he walked in the snow.
[00:46:50.139 --> 00:46:51.579]  You've ruined this country.
[00:46:52.139 --> 00:46:54.099]  Everyone around you is running from you.
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.219]  They're abandoning you.
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.639]  Chrystia Freeland, Sean Frazier, they've all left you.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.059]  It's time for you to go.
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.099]  It's time for Canada to have an election.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:02.559]  You're not the king.
[00:47:06.539 --> 00:47:09.719]  His own administration is collapsing right out from under him.
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:13.139]  And the same zeitgeist is prevalent here in the United States of America.
[00:47:13.679 --> 00:47:17.719]  And there's really no difference between the Justin Trudeaus and the Liz Cheneys.
[00:47:18.019 --> 00:47:19.340]  Or the Adam Kinzigers.
[00:47:19.519 --> 00:47:26.260]  They're all just this political globalist class that wants to advocate and represent the deep state instead of the interests of their constituents.
[00:47:26.639 --> 00:47:30.300]  And what happens when you do that is your constituents end up hating you and abandoning you.
[00:47:31.989 --> 00:47:33.170]  They know that they're guilty.
[00:47:33.389 --> 00:47:34.789]  They know that they're subversive.
[00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:39.150]  They know that they are acting against the interests of the constituents.
[00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:40.809]  Frankly, it's treasonous.
[00:47:40.909 --> 00:47:57.940]  We've got House GOP accusing Liz Cheney of tampering with J6 witnesses Asking now for the FBI to investigate criminality, we're going to show you clip C here of this report, and then we're going to show you clip number 27. I'll plug that after we unpack this clip,
[00:47:58.159 --> 00:48:01.119]  where there's evidence that they're destroying documents.
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:02.320]  I mean...
[00:48:03.619 --> 00:48:07.579]  How much more obvious is it that these people are criminals if they have to destroy their own evidence?
[00:48:07.739 --> 00:48:14.599]  First of all, they make up all this bogus evidence in order to persecute political dissidents and opponents like Trump and his supporters for January 6th.
[00:48:14.679 --> 00:48:28.199]  And then when they get caught doing it and they lose all power because the people wake up, then they burn the real documents that prove that they were engaged in unlawful behavior against the interests of the American people.
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:33.849]  This is clip C. Thank you.
[00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:41.130]  Thank you.
[00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:52.289]  That the Federal Bureau of Investigation criminally investigate Liz Cheney when President Trump takes over on January 20th.
[00:48:52.449 --> 00:48:54.809]  One of several bombshell revelations in here.
[00:48:54.969 --> 00:49:02.150]  The report also says that Jack Smith colluded with the January 6th Committee, but that some of the evidence has not yet been turned over to Congress.
[00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:08.070]  They're demanding that that evidence be turned over, something that might happen when the new administration takes over.
[00:49:08.349 --> 00:49:21.500]  But a really significant and rare moment for Congress to actually suggest that one of its members should be criminally prosecuted For tampering with a witness in an official government proceeding, a House hearing, the January 6th House hearing.
[00:49:21.739 --> 00:49:31.130]  As you remember, Cassidy Heptison was the bombshell witness for the Democrats, claimed that Donald Trump Tried to commandeer the presidential limousine taken to the Capitol.
[00:49:31.269 --> 00:49:32.329]  We now know that wasn't true.
[00:49:32.429 --> 00:49:35.329]  The Secret Service had already told Liz Cheney it wasn't true.
[00:49:35.409 --> 00:49:39.369]  She presented the evidence anyways to the American public, tried to give it credence.
[00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:45.829]  There's some other testimony where Cassidy Hutchinson talks about a document she claims she wrote it.
[00:49:45.849 --> 00:49:46.369]  She didn't.
[00:49:46.469 --> 00:49:47.250]  Someone else wrote it.
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:57.440]  All of that is laid out in this report, but the headline is Liz Cheney could be facing an FBI criminal investigation based on this information that Congress has transmitted this morning.
[00:49:58.219 --> 00:50:00.079]  John, a quick follow-up real quick.
[00:50:00.239 --> 00:50:06.840]  I'm looking at witness tampering, obviously a federal crime, up to potentially 20 years in prison if this is witness tampering.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.760]  It's a very serious allegation.
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:16.920]  And as we now know from the reporting we did a few months ago, Liz Cheney was communicating to Cassidy Hutchinson around her lawyer.
[00:50:17.019 --> 00:50:18.320]  She was represented by a lawyer.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:29.179]  When you go out and reach out to someone around their lawyer, you're violating the D.C. bar ethics, which, by the way, Liz Cheney was a barred lawyer in D.C., so she was obligated to follow those rules.
[00:50:29.739 --> 00:50:31.420]  But it goes beyond that.
[00:50:31.539 --> 00:50:36.699]  It suggests that she was trying to influence the testimony, get her to say things that would make Donald Trump look worse.
[00:50:37.139 --> 00:50:50.769]  This is a very serious allegation from Chairman Barry Laudamilk, the head of this committee, the guy who's run the Counter January 6 investigation that has found so many things we were denied and not told about in the earlier probe, but a really significant moment today.
[00:50:50.889 --> 00:50:51.150]  And you're right.
[00:50:51.289 --> 00:50:57.230]  If the FBI were to pursue charges, this would be a very serious crime and one that could carry some serious prison time.
[00:50:59.449 --> 00:51:03.769]  There's evidence now, and we already knew this, but now it's being reported widespread.
[00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:04.730]  It's being admitted.
[00:51:04.909 --> 00:51:07.349]  There's an administration in place that's actually going to do something about it.
[00:51:08.849 --> 00:51:26.170]  But now it's public information that the January 6th committee was engaged in witness tampering, that Liz Cheney and others were engaged in witness tampering, manipulating that whole entire process to favor their desired political outcome.
[00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:40.530]  And it was implicitly obvious to begin with because they hired Hollywood producers to try to make basically a C-SPAN broadcast look as cinematic as possible.
[00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:46.949]  And then they paid millions upon millions, I believe, to air it during prime time on major networks.
[00:51:46.949 --> 00:51:49.110]  Very coveted time slots, traditionally speaking.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.860]  So obviously the whole thing was always about optics.
[00:51:53.099 --> 00:51:59.940]  Why would you spend all that money and invest in all that if you weren't gonna tamper with the witnesses or if you weren't gonna get the desired outcome from the witnesses in that committee?
[00:52:00.099 --> 00:52:01.699]  But they're gonna burn the documents, folks.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:07.659]  This is clip number 27, which suggests that they're already engaged in covering their tracks.
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:08.119]  Let's watch.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.960]  The inspector general is coming out with all of these facts.
[00:52:12.079 --> 00:52:15.960]  Does that mean that Liz Cheney and the J6 committee knew about this?
[00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:22.170]  Well, wouldn't that be great to know, Maria, but they destroyed all the documents on their way out.
[00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:26.150]  So, again, this whole thing was propped up.
[00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:29.309]  I just think you have to look at the arc of the story here.
[00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:39.150]  The January 6th committee was set up for the very specific purpose of giving somebody like Jack Smith the reason to go charge President Trump and to take him out politically.
[00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:40.969]  You know, that's the whole thing.
[00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:49.150]  They staged — they had a Hollywood producer, Maria, Come in and do the January 6th hearings with Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and that whole crew.
[00:52:49.449 --> 00:52:50.469]  It was a total joke.
[00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:52.210]  They destroy the documents on the way out.
[00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:56.250]  Jack Smith props up these ridiculous cases that, of course, had no legal merit.
[00:52:56.409 --> 00:52:59.369]  The Supreme Court knocks it out with the presidential immunity ruling anyway.
[00:52:59.889 --> 00:53:03.730]  Fannie Willis, their second in command, is meeting at the White House coordinating.
[00:53:03.989 --> 00:53:07.190]  The number three person at DOJ goes to the New York prosecutor's office.
[00:53:07.429 --> 00:53:25.139]  And President Trump stared all of this down, all of it So, as terrible as all this stuff was, the light at the end of the tunnel here is we're on the precipice,
[00:53:25.159 --> 00:53:31.139]  I think, of a great American renewal here, not just economically, not just militarily, but for transparency.
[00:53:31.789 --> 00:53:33.670]  All right, folks, we're coming up on a break here.
[00:53:33.869 --> 00:53:39.030]  On the other side of this break, we're going to air a report from Ian Carroll, who's going to be our guest for the next hour.
[00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:51.510]  Ian Carroll, known on X as At Ian Carroll Show, is a content creator and investigative journalist who focuses on uncovering conspiracy theories and discussing corruption, media biases, and global control structures.
[00:53:51.889 --> 00:53:55.150]  Carroll is recognized for his investigative journalism and content creation.
[00:53:55.269 --> 00:53:59.949]  He's been involved in exposing large corporations and discussing complex political and economic theories.
[00:54:00.739 --> 00:54:06.679]  He also hosts live talks and discussions often focusing on controversial topics like the influence of the deep state and global mafias.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:09.320]  Folks, stay tuned for Ian Carroll next hour.
[00:54:09.619 --> 00:54:11.179]  This is a vital transmission.
[00:54:11.179 --> 00:54:13.280]  We are reaching tens of millions of new people a day.
[00:54:13.719 --> 00:54:17.260]  We are one of the most devastating operations of the globalists thanks to your support.
[00:54:19.289 --> 00:54:20.130]  We need to stay on air.
[00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:21.710]  I make it easy for you to do that.
[00:54:21.869 --> 00:54:25.730]  Do your Christmas shopping at thealexjonesstore.com and at drjonesnaturals.com.

[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.099]  Do your Christmas shopping with us.

[00:54:50.539 --> 00:54:52.460]  And when I say amazing, I'm excited.
[00:54:52.679 --> 00:54:54.599]  I know these are going to go quickly.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:55:01.500]  Unfortunately, This will solve all our problems, but they only made $2,000 in this limited edition.
[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:07.599]  But it'll go a long way towards our lawsuits and funding our operations and the new network and everything else and keeping InfoWars on it.
[00:55:07.739 --> 00:55:08.420]  That continues.
[00:55:08.619 --> 00:55:09.420]  Look at this bad boy.
[00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:12.280]  The 1984 versus 1776 coin.
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:13.099]  I designed it.
[00:55:13.219 --> 00:55:19.519]  There's only 2,000 of these bad boys at TheAlexJonesStore.com and they are a fundraiser.
[00:55:19.639 --> 00:55:21.000]  They are a piece of history.
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:23.000]  They're pure silver.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.920]  They are minted here in America.
[00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:28.250]  2,000 of these.
[00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:30.710]  I predict these sell out in just a couple days.
[00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:35.110]  This is a great Christmas gift, a memento that you stood for the Republic at a critical time.
[00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:36.349]  They are incredible.
[00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:43.130]  Get the 1984 versus 1776 coin at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:51.239]  And it's not, the store's not owned by me, so even if the globalists come after us, Even if they take over Infowars next week, they're not going to shut down the Alex Jones store.com.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:54.559]  That is our main sponsor for the Alex Jones Network and everything we're doing going into the future.
[00:55:54.679 --> 00:55:57.519]  So get this amazing coin now.
[00:55:57.699 --> 00:56:05.980]  And if you don't want to, don't have the money to get that because it's marked up for a fundraiser, a memento, a limited edition, we have challenge coins, a whole bunch of them.
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:11.539]  Between 995 and 1495, when tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:14.159]  And on the other side, it's got the Gadsden flag, don't tread on me.
[00:56:14.739 --> 00:56:17.260]  1776, another one with Alex Jones, yours truly on it.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:22.840]  The answer to 1904 is 1776 with the Gadsden flag, rebellion to tyrants and obedience to God on the other side.
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:24.699]  And there's some other great challenge coins as well.
[00:56:24.889 --> 00:56:27.909]  at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:30.230]  Now, this is even more exciting.
[00:56:30.409 --> 00:56:31.469]  They surprised me with this.
[00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:32.550]  I just learned this morning.
[00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:39.250]  So it's in the mail from Arkansas where their factory is and their shipping department and all that, the big lead that owns and runs thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:56:39.409 --> 00:56:44.409]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump on a Stump, 1995. Everybody loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:47.469]  This is Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:49.510]  Oh, my daughter loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:51.250]  They play with him and do all sorts of stuff.
[00:56:51.969 --> 00:56:54.329]  Catapult around the house, play with the cats, play with them.
[00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:58.110]  We probably got 15 of those Elf on a Shelf, a little elf village in the backyard.
[00:56:58.349 --> 00:56:58.929]  We had a lot of fun.
[00:56:59.369 --> 00:57:02.869]  She puts Christmas tree lights on these little trees we got in the backyard.
[00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:04.929]  Oh my gosh, I've got to have this.
[00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:05.769]  And I already called them.
[00:57:05.909 --> 00:57:07.909]  I said, I want 10 set aside for me.
[00:57:07.929 --> 00:57:08.829]  So that means there's...
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.300]  1,900 and something of these.
[00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:14.980]  And I'm telling you, this is going to sell out today.
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:17.420]  Why they didn't get 20,000 of them, I don't know.
[00:57:17.539 --> 00:57:18.679]  All my problems would be solved.
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:19.900]  We would have plenty of fun.
[00:57:20.039 --> 00:57:21.639]  This baby is amazing.
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:27.019]  Everybody needs to have this original Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:57:27.159 --> 00:57:30.920]  Celebrate Christmas with the Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:57:31.059 --> 00:57:34.159]  The ultimate conversation starter for your tree or mantle.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:34.860]  Fully podcasted.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:42.320]  Poseable and ready to take on the globalist, this festive figure can be positioned in any stance from bold and defiant to perfectly perched.
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:50.500]  Whether you're decking the halls or making a statement, this patriotic decoration will keep the spirit of 1776 alive all season long, right into Trump getting inaugurated next month.
[00:57:50.679 --> 00:57:52.300]  Get your Trump on a stump now!
[00:57:52.539 --> 00:58:00.559]  Ultimate CMOS, Patriot gear, amazing hoodies, Christmas sweaters and more, and fund the second American Revolution worldwide at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:19.920]  I just got word that TikTok is apparently gonna stop censoring conservative viewpoints with the new incoming administration because they don't want to get banned.
[00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:32.889]  And while I'm not sure that's gonna extend to stopping censoring The truth and conspiracy theories and actual evidence contrary to the mainstream narrative.
[00:58:33.369 --> 00:58:37.550]  But I figure we'll start today with a nice conservative conspiracy theory that was recently proven true.
[00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:41.829]  Because yesterday when I posted, there's like a hundred comments being like, bro, where have you been?
[00:58:41.969 --> 00:58:44.269]  You're like, not on my FYP. Yeah, I know.
[00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:49.710]  It's because they banned my backup account and my main account has been one strike away from getting banned for ages.
[00:58:49.849 --> 00:58:51.329]  So I just don't even post my videos here.
[00:58:51.429 --> 00:58:57.909]  I've been on, you know, Other places where speech is actually free for quite some time now.
[00:58:58.269 --> 00:59:02.150]  But I'm coming back because apparently I'm welcome again.
[00:59:02.389 --> 00:59:03.710]  We'll see how long it lasts.
[00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:09.489]  But recently, one of the biggest conspiracy theories was proven true.
[00:59:09.969 --> 00:59:11.510]  This is Thomas Massey.
[00:59:12.099 --> 00:59:22.000]  Tweeting about how A.G. Merrick Garland has been lying to him under oath for years about what happened on J6. Because the DOJ inspector general released the report today.
[00:59:22.219 --> 00:59:24.000]  Well, not today, you know, days ago.
[00:59:24.159 --> 00:59:26.360]  And it looks like this, and you can read it for yourself.
[00:59:26.579 --> 00:59:33.000]  And it clearly states that the FBI had 26 confidential human sources in DC on January 6th.
[00:59:33.519 --> 00:59:36.039]  13 entered the restricted area around the Capitol.
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:37.719]  And nine didn't.
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:48.550]  See, this is how they've been getting away with their little wordplay all along, is they found no evidence that the FBI had Undercover employees, because that's not how they do these operations.
[00:59:49.050 --> 00:59:55.869]  You're also not supposed to talk about how Trump posted two different tweets on that day asking everyone to go home and to be peaceful and to respect the police.
[00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:59.929]  And Twitter deleted his tweets that he was tweeting before everything kicked off.
[01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:03.329]  He made a video about how everyone should go home and be peaceful.
[01:00:03.329 --> 01:00:08.349]  And it's been a great time, but like, it's over, go home before everything happened.
[01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:10.889]  He also tweeted this one.
[01:00:11.599 --> 01:00:12.400]  Remain peaceful.
[01:00:12.659 --> 01:00:13.260]  No violence.
[01:00:13.659 --> 01:00:14.820]  We're the party of law and order.
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:15.719]  Respect the law.
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:16.820]  Back the blue.
[01:00:17.059 --> 01:00:17.500]  Thank you.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.019]  They deleted this one too.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:23.840]  This was like a major red-pilling moment for me because I watched that happen live in real time.
[01:00:24.039 --> 01:00:26.000]  And it was all super fishy.
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:38.000]  Everything from videos of them like waving protesters through the barricades and like opening it up to them opening the doors and letting the protesters in.
[01:00:38.889 --> 01:00:40.510]  And I'm not saying that no violence happened.
[01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:42.489]  I'm not saying that it was like 100 foot peaceful.
[01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:52.929]  I'm just saying that when you actually looked at all the evidence, it was pretty clear that there was something else going on that was giving the news cycle to follow for the next three to four years.
[01:00:53.489 --> 01:00:56.230]  Like, they walked them in and gave them a tour.
[01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:57.630]  Peaceful.
[01:00:57.969 --> 01:00:59.150]  Like, they're just chilling.
[01:00:59.550 --> 01:01:05.710]  And then they're just like, Walked around having a little peaceful march in most places.
[01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:12.409]  Like, there is other footage that is violent and crazy, but this is what most of the footage looks like when you actually go and look at it.
[01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:16.389]  And I know TikTok's gonna go crazy, like, see, I told you he was a mug of money.
[01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:18.170]  It's like, bro, like, calm down.
[01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:19.909]  I'm a follow the money guy.
[01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:23.650]  And a lot of the Republicans are fucking evil pieces of shit, too.
[01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:25.869]  The whole establishment can go to hell.
[01:01:26.429 --> 01:01:32.750]  I'm going to look at the evidence and think critically for yourself, not putting yourself into a stupid left or right box guy.
[01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:48.789]  And when you look at the evidence about the protests that happened on January 6th, the insurrection, and then you look at how they used that story as a tactical media hit piece to try to take down Trump for years afterwards, it's pretty clear there was something else going on.
[01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:54.889]  Especially when you compare that to the BLM riots and how differently they were treated and how differently they looked.
[01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:57.969]  And I lived right next to some of the biggest ones.
[01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:02.690]  My girlfriend had to move out of Seattle at the time because she was inside of that autonomous zone.
[01:02:02.909 --> 01:02:12.719]  So when I saw the media calling this mostly peaceful and calling the other one an insurrection, I smelled bullshit from 10 miles away.
[01:02:13.119 --> 01:02:15.099]  Not gonna stop after election day.
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:18.880]  And that should be, everyone should take note of that on both levels.
[01:02:19.139 --> 01:02:21.699]  That this isn't, they're not gonna let up and they should not.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.000]  And we should not.
[01:02:23.179 --> 01:02:24.980]  And at the time, I knew so little.
[01:02:25.099 --> 01:02:28.500]  It was before I had made researching my job, before I had gotten informed.
[01:02:28.699 --> 01:02:33.940]  But I was at least, you know, self-aware enough to think critically.
[01:02:34.039 --> 01:02:34.880]  Because I've been raised liberal.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.619]  Alright folks, we've got Ian Carroll joining us after this one minute break.
[01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:43.449]  Stay with us for this groundbreaking critical broadcast.
[01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:45.170]  It's an honor and a pleasure to speak with him again.
[01:02:45.269 --> 01:02:46.309]  I always enjoy our time together.
[01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:48.210]  Continually impressed with his work.
[01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:54.210]  Make sure you follow him, and make sure you visit thealexjonesstore.com to be the reason we are still on the air in this one-minute break.
[01:02:54.389 --> 01:02:55.389]  More on the other side.
[01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:57.309]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is The Alex Jones Show.
[01:02:57.329 --> 01:03:00.530]  I am Chase Geiser, joined this hour by Ian Carroll.
[01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:04.329]  Ian Carroll known on X as at IanCarrollShow.com.
[01:03:04.369 --> 01:03:12.949]  is a content creator and investigative journalist who focuses on uncovering conspiracy theories and discussing corruption, media biases, and global control structures.
[01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:15.030]  Ian, it is an honor and a pleasure to be with you again.
[01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:18.369]  I really enjoyed our last broadcast together on The Alex Jones Show.
[01:03:18.449 --> 01:03:19.769]  Thanks again for coming back.
[01:03:20.799 --> 01:03:21.079]  Absolutely.
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.179]  Good to talk to you, Chase.
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:23.219]  It's always fun.
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.239]  I love what you guys cover.
[01:03:24.659 --> 01:03:24.940]  Thank you.
[01:03:25.019 --> 01:03:25.800]  I appreciate that.
[01:03:26.099 --> 01:03:27.760]  So I don't even know where to begin.
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:34.940]  When I first asked you to come on, I wanted to talk a little bit about the AI whistleblower who died mysteriously.
[01:03:35.679 --> 01:03:38.920]  And I think we're going to have plenty of time to get into it because we do have an hour together, which is awesome.
[01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:56.010]  But now with these Liz Cheney developments and this evidence coming out that she's been manipulating or engaged with witness tampering and there's other reports or at least allegations that they were engaged in document destruction in a very Nazi-esque fashion.
[01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:59.070]  What is going on?
[01:03:59.309 --> 01:04:00.590]  Let's start with the J6 stuff.
[01:04:00.809 --> 01:04:03.409]  What happened on January 6, according to your research?
[01:04:03.550 --> 01:04:07.010]  What is happening now and what will happen after Trump is inaugurated?
[01:04:09.539 --> 01:04:15.699]  What happened on J6, I mean, if it's not, I would assume it's already wildly apparent to your entire audience.
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:22.619]  And I'd imagine that a lot of your audience knows as much or more than me because it's so deep and we watched it unfold right before our eyes.
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:32.539]  But even if you knew nothing about January 6, all it takes is a little bit of understanding of history and you see the same playbook played over and over and over again.
[01:04:32.539 --> 01:04:35.420]  And they've got it down to a science now where they create...
[01:04:45.679 --> 01:04:48.480]  Mm-hmm.
[01:04:57.329 --> 01:05:03.610]  And once they've constructed a narrative, that's the crux, that's the hard part, then they can use that as propaganda for years.
[01:05:03.769 --> 01:05:17.650]  And just looking at how they talked about January 6th should tell you everything you need to know, without even researching the pipe bomb situation, without researching the footage, without researching the confidential human sources, or any of the disclosure that we've gotten since then.
[01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:24.369]  But it is refreshing to finally get some hard evidence, some documentation of the crimes that they committed on the way to creating this narrative.
[01:05:24.989 --> 01:05:38.230]  Well, one of the things that I've noticed and we've been reporting on here at Infowars, as our perspective is, it seems like there's a massive house of cards collapsing within the political class.
[01:05:38.369 --> 01:05:40.670]  And I know that's a very broad statement.
[01:05:40.889 --> 01:05:58.690]  When I say political class, I mean the elected officials in our bureaucracy, the bureaucrats, And all the members of the political industrial complex, including the military industrial complex, including NGOs, including other organizations that make money in the same way the military makes money off of war,
[01:05:58.829 --> 01:06:03.369]  but off of other issues, whether it's energy or some climate disaster or something like that.
[01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:05.769]  It seems like there's a major collapse happening.
[01:06:05.849 --> 01:06:10.889]  And part of that is what I call the private political press, which is a part of the political class.
[01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:15.230]  It's this legacy media, which ever since Mockingbird has been infiltrated and controlled.
[01:06:16.610 --> 01:06:22.909]  And up until recently, really had a monopoly on information in the United States and much of Europe, actually.
[01:06:23.610 --> 01:06:34.010]  And with X and TikTok, and I know TikTok's not a very good example because they censor perhaps more than any other platform, but they censor in a fashion that is outside the jurisdiction of the United States.
[01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:38.610]  So they're not censoring on behalf of our government, they're censoring on behalf of another government or other interests.
[01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:57.440]  But what's happening is we have the TikToks and the Xs now, which are Out of the jurisdiction of our deep state and perceived as a great threat to the narrative control, I want to ask you what you think about this because you mentioned how they have to construct a narrative.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:01.119]  Once it's established, they can use it as propaganda for years to come.
[01:07:01.659 --> 01:07:09.739]  The fact of the matter is, the platforms and the media outlets through which they used to construct these narratives simply don't have an audience anymore.
[01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:13.610]  How are they responding to this?
[01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:22.469]  I mean, should we expect an escalation as the mainstream media becomes more and more vulnerable, as the deep state becomes less and less powerful in the psychological operation of narrative control?
[01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:27.570]  What's going on in the deep state's mind as free speech seems to have a comeback on the internet?
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:29.760]  You're completely right.
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:39.559]  I try to always reframe in my mind and my viewers' minds that the Cold War was not about nukes as much as it was about information.
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:51.119]  It was the invention of nukes that switched the focus of war from empires fighting each other kinetically on a battlefield To information being the primary tool of warfare.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:08:01.800]  And certainly there's proxy wars involved in the Cold War mindset, but that was a fundamental shift towards intelligence agencies and away from military force being the primary mode.
[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:03.300]  And we still live in that.
[01:08:03.599 --> 01:08:04.980]  You know, terrain today.
[01:08:05.239 --> 01:08:10.139]  And it's only accelerated with the invention of the internet and with social media technologies.
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:19.199]  And you're absolutely right that they're scrambling to try to keep a lid on the wide dispersion of information that is allowed by our modern social media landscape.
[01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:22.529]  And I think that that looks like two things.
[01:08:22.649 --> 01:08:32.229]  And we see them clawing and clawing to maintain control over legacy media and to maintain engagement with legacy media and their authority over the truth.
[01:08:32.369 --> 01:08:45.770]  But they're also starting, and they have for a long time, realized that they are starting to infiltrate the alternative media spaces through the creation of studios, the funding of studios, the funding or subversion of various influencers.
[01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:47.529]  They've always had...
[01:08:48.329 --> 01:08:53.069]  Very bizarre that David Pakman, for example, lost 5,000 subscribers on YouTube the day after the election.
[01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:54.850]  Yeah, bingo, right?
[01:08:55.010 --> 01:09:07.229]  And so I think that these days the tactics that they're trying to use are not yet honed and they're not necessarily super easy to spot because it feels like they're trying to take a lot of shots into our decentralized media space.
[01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:12.729]  And one of those types of shots is taking down The Alec Jones Show and Infowars as an example.
[01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:13.029]  Sure.
[01:09:13.029 --> 01:09:16.789]  You can't just destroy them with all the money in the world.
[01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:20.890]  But did I just lose video on you guys?
[01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:21.770]  Yeah, it came back though.
[01:09:21.930 --> 01:09:22.609]  It looks like a different camera.
[01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:23.970]  Yeah, it did.
[01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:28.170]  Anyways, it just like...
[01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:29.350]  Oh, weird.
[01:09:29.449 --> 01:09:30.689]  Yeah, my camera just shut off.
[01:09:30.869 --> 01:09:31.130]  It's alright.
[01:09:31.310 --> 01:09:32.409]  We can still see you and hear you.
[01:09:32.489 --> 01:09:32.829]  Keep going.
[01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:43.810]  Yeah, so it feels like we are facing an all-out assault on all fronts because realistically, what can they do other than they need to maintain control over the information space?
[01:09:43.869 --> 01:09:49.510]  As you watch things like the war in Syria breaking out, they need to control the narrative around that war in Syria.
[01:09:49.569 --> 01:09:59.069]  As the coming financial collapse starts to play out, they're going to need to keep control over that narrative because, like normal, they have been behind the...
[01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:05.609]  The setup and the tip of the dominoes, so to speak, this is their house of cards that's falling.
[01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:13.670]  And if they can't pass the narrative to pass the blame onto whoever they need to, like Iran, for example, very quickly their empire falls.
[01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:14.909]  Absolutely.
[01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:20.989]  So just to be totally candid with you, I'm a ride-or-die Trump guy.
[01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:26.109]  And the only reason that I am is because all the world's supervillains seem to hate him.
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:33.899]  And I come from a very objectivist, Ayn Rand, libertarian background in terms of political philosophy.
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:38.520]  So I understand that Trump was imperfect to say the least in his first administration.
[01:10:38.659 --> 01:10:39.720]  Surrounded himself with bad people.
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.819]  Hated the last year of his first term.
[01:10:42.119 --> 01:10:44.100]  I think hindsight's 20-20 on a lot of that.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:48.060]  I'm not somebody who's a shill for Trump, but I am ride or die for him.
[01:10:48.539 --> 01:10:58.079]  The reason I bring that up is because after he was elected in 2016, there was a zeitgeist that rippled through Trump supporters that things were going to get better.
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:02.180]  And they kind of did for a few years, even though they got more difficult and there were obstacles.
[01:11:02.479 --> 01:11:05.420]  But as soon as he was elected in 2016...
[01:11:06.119 --> 01:11:17.039]  Hell was unleashed upon him, his administration, his supporters, impeachments, prosecutions, allegations, espionage, you know, the highest levels.
[01:11:18.899 --> 01:11:22.600]  What do you anticipate is going to happen this go around?
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:33.939]  Because it seems to me that even though it feels like we just kicked globalist ass in this election, it seems to me that we've awoken or reawakened a sleeping giant of this establishment.
[01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:42.510]  The power dynamic has changed, and the mediums are slightly different.
[01:11:42.829 --> 01:11:47.590]  But I imagine we're going to see very similar attempts over the course of the next four years against this administration.
[01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:48.390]  What do you anticipate?
[01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:51.310]  I think you're exactly on point, man.
[01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:59.409]  He was not a politician when he was elected in 2016. And he was a very powerful and intelligent man, but I don't...
[01:11:59.409 --> 01:12:14.680]  And maybe that's just the nature of the first crack in sort of the Just global deep state networks and power systems that they've always had that you can't break into that and start the process of change without it looking real messy the first couple years.
[01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:20.130]  But this time he's coming in as a relatively seasoned politician at this specific job.
[01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:29.250]  And he's coming in surrounded by very powerful people that have a ton of experience that have been attacked and defamed and gone after by the same establishment.
[01:12:29.529 --> 01:12:33.529]  So I think we're all pretty excited because it's going to be very different this time around.
[01:12:33.670 --> 01:12:37.250]  But that's not to say that the deep state is rolling over and giving up.
[01:12:37.369 --> 01:12:39.710]  They still have all kinds of power in this world.
[01:12:40.509 --> 01:12:52.750]  But the thing that you've been kind of like touching on the edges of all along throughout this conversation so far is that the narrative, the control, the deep state relies on lies.
[01:12:52.930 --> 01:12:54.670]  They rely on subversion of the truth.
[01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:56.409]  They rely on steering of the narratives.
[01:12:56.609 --> 01:13:10.109]  And I think that inherently like evil pursuits, the pursuit of lying sort of has its own death sentence written into it because Every liar knows that you have to tell more and more lies to defend your old lies.
[01:13:10.270 --> 01:13:24.649]  And so as the information space becomes more diverse and more open, and as the lies get more and more complex and more and more tied together, they're all starting to collapse just by the sort of natural entropy of a world built on lies.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:30.300]  Evil has outdone itself in the world and its time has come.
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:33.760]  And I think that history has gone through cycles like this many, many times.
[01:13:34.039 --> 01:13:42.840]  And we're not going to come out of it with the perfect world where there is no longer evil and there's no more human trafficking and there's no more war at all in the world.
[01:13:42.939 --> 01:13:50.359]  But I certainly feel like the pendulum is swinging towards righteousness and goodness because regular people just en masse are opening their eyes.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:56.989]  And to your point about Trump's persecution, I was not pro-Trump in 2016. I was kind of disengaged.
[01:13:57.130 --> 01:14:05.270]  But by 2020, after having watched what they did, it just had worn down sort of the liberal mindset that I had been given from birth.
[01:14:05.329 --> 01:14:09.310]  And I was just questioning what was going on because of how much they were attacking him.
[01:14:09.369 --> 01:14:10.210]  It's just really obvious.
[01:14:10.329 --> 01:14:19.090]  And I think that that's sort of the natural state of affairs when your whole argument is based on lies and slander and defamation and evil.
[01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:37.359]  It just kind of Well, and I think what the greatest advantage that the Democrats had over the Republicans for our generation growing up is that the neoconservative movement was in love with war and very dogmatic.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:45.619]  And I hold some of those dogmatic values personally, but I do not want the government to enforce them, right?
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:52.199]  If we're going to talk about things like pornography or gay marriage, I may harbor some of those sentiments personally, but I don't like the government.
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:54.779]  I mean, I don't even know why the government is involved in any marriage at all.
[01:14:54.899 --> 01:14:56.319]  Why can't you just go to your church and get married?
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.420]  I don't get it, right?
[01:14:57.659 --> 01:14:59.039]  And so a lot of...
[01:14:59.039 --> 01:15:02.060]  And I don't want to speak for you, but I know that a lot of members of my generation...
[01:15:03.039 --> 01:15:19.159]  We're so turned off by Republicans because it was so dogmatic and it seemed hypocritical that you would claim to advocate for freedom and free markets but then simultaneously try to regulate personal decisions and things like that,
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:19.380]  right?
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:21.119]  Whether it's marijuana or whatever.
[01:15:21.819 --> 01:15:29.520]  And I think the neocon element of the Republican Party It has basically been rendered powerless, at least for now.
[01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:40.760]  And that is a tremendous, tremendous threat to Democratic future success because that was the main reason a lot of people were like, screw the Republicans.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:41.560]  I'm a Democrat.
[01:15:41.739 --> 01:15:42.060]  I'm a liberal.
[01:15:42.199 --> 01:15:44.439]  Even Joe Rogan has talked about this over the course of the years.
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.399]  Like, I'm not a Republican.
[01:15:45.579 --> 01:15:47.119]  I don't believe in that dogmatic stuff.
[01:15:47.239 --> 01:15:48.399]  But that's gone now.
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:49.579]  Everyone's sick of the wars.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:52.279]  Everyone just wants a populist movement.
[01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:58.850]  That it's the people versus the political class, not the right versus the left that's the real conflict of our time.
[01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:04.510]  Do you think that this is a sustainable path to success moving forward or do you think the dynamics are gonna shift back again?
[01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:21.699]  I think it's the only path to success and I think that it's partly bottom up and it's partly top down in how the world is changing right now in the sense that You know, the deep state, the permanent state has always kind of played both sides of the political spectrum.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:33.380]  But it really feels like back in the George Bush era and beyond, they were more heavily leaning into the right and into Republican because they kind of housed their neocon movement in the Republican Party.
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:33.600]  Yes.
[01:16:34.210 --> 01:16:35.869]  In a really powerful way.
[01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:41.350]  And I think that that has to do with sort of like, I mean, I've got a lot of ideas about how republicanism.
[01:16:41.710 --> 01:16:45.569]  There was an evangelical base, and they were inherently anti-Islam.
[01:16:45.789 --> 01:16:50.289]  And so it was very easy to be a warmonger and republican at that time, because it was just another war against Muslims.
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:51.579]  Bingo.
[01:16:51.859 --> 01:17:04.819]  And with Obama coming in, I think that was one of, like, the Bush to Obama era was, I think, one of their most successful timelines in history because they slid Obama in very well.
[01:17:04.819 --> 01:17:11.420]  And they very tactfully moved a lot of their infrastructure and narrative, like, control structure to the left.
[01:17:11.579 --> 01:17:21.590]  And I think by the time they ran Hillary Clinton, they had, the establishment state had It ensconced itself so thoroughly on the left that they weren't ready, and the right was wide open.
[01:17:21.649 --> 01:17:28.689]  And Trump just happened to, maybe by coincidence, walk in and start a populist movement on the right just as they had moved all their infrastructure away.
[01:17:28.930 --> 01:17:34.649]  Because you can only lean the deep state narrative into one side or the other super heavily.
[01:17:34.649 --> 01:17:37.890]  You can't have the narrative be both sides at once.
[01:17:37.890 --> 01:17:39.329]  You need it to be us versus them.
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:57.880]  I think that...
[01:17:58.359 --> 01:18:03.579]  This is the real, like, problem with information warfare is that we all have power.
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.840]  We all are part of the information war.
[01:18:05.979 --> 01:18:09.239]  And the hearts and minds of the American people are true.
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:10.579]  Like, we're real people.
[01:18:10.699 --> 01:18:13.159]  We're not deep state neocons.
[01:18:13.239 --> 01:18:14.500]  We're not paid for our opinions.
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:17.260]  And so all they can do is control what we see and know.
[01:18:17.609 --> 01:18:20.810]  I think?
[01:18:33.199 --> 01:18:34.819]  That it just is unsustainable.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:43.100]  And there's so many people like the right looks like I am one of these people that I come from the left and RFK gave me an invitation to stand in the middle.
[01:18:43.279 --> 01:18:47.119]  And then looking at the right, it's like, well, they're very welcoming and they don't want war.
[01:18:47.239 --> 01:18:52.020]  And they suddenly when people are looking at the right, it's like, oh, that's a very reasonable place to be right now.
[01:18:52.159 --> 01:18:56.630]  And you look at the left and it's like, I'm sorry, we're like chopping kids' genitals off?
[01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:58.229]  Like, how is this gay rights?
[01:18:59.130 --> 01:19:10.710]  And so, like, and this is not a new, you know, everyone is feeling this and everyone is saying this, that the left has just gone off the deep end And I don't know if they think it's a smart play or what they're doing.
[01:19:11.170 --> 01:19:12.590]  I'm concerned mostly.
[01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:27.750]  My biggest concern is that it's so stupid what it looks like they're doing that maybe it's a show and there's something more complex that we haven't identified yet because it seems too juvenile and too incompetent, the strategies that they seem to be employing to try to maintain control.
[01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.750]  Absolutely.
[01:19:30.130 --> 01:19:42.390]  My concern is, and this is true of War and cinema and political and business institutions, the more vulnerable they become, the more dangerous they become.
[01:19:42.489 --> 01:19:44.090]  Like a dog backed into a corner.
[01:19:44.970 --> 01:19:52.470]  And it's been said, oh, Russia, if it's about to lose the war with Ukraine, we'll use nuclear weapons because if they have no choice but to use nukes, then they'll use nukes.
[01:19:52.569 --> 01:20:06.090]  So my concern is we have this traditionally incredibly powerful deep state in its many facets that now seems to really be experiencing some serious erosion to its legacy power.
[01:20:06.729 --> 01:20:07.289]  Yeah.
[01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:14.909]  They have had the audacity to do some of the most evil things that you've ever heard of over the last 50 years.
[01:20:15.369 --> 01:20:21.689]  What does their vulnerability mean for an escalation of their audacity for evil in the next couple of years?
[01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:27.590]  We feel like we're winning, but now are they going to bring out some big guns that we haven't experienced before?
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:44.159]  That's a question on all of our minds, and this actually links us right to one of the big stories right now, is I've been worried for quite some time, and I've gotten some flack online for saying that the air in the geopolitical space right now feels like we're ready for another 9-11.
[01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:50.300]  Not in the sense that we want it, but in the sense that it is the perfect time for the deep state to play that.
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:55.500]  In the fact that That we're warmongering with Iran.
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:03.579]  Israel is in deep need of another political unrest or some sort of renewal of fervor for the fight against radical Islam in the Middle East.
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:11.239]  The US, the warmongers in the US desperately need a major distraction that will unify us against a foreign enemy like Iran.
[01:21:11.539 --> 01:21:21.739]  And we also – we need another massive injection of stimulus based on nothing into our economy in order for the Ponzi scheme to keep on playing.
[01:21:21.779 --> 01:21:39.289]  And so for quite some time, I have been saying that I am worried about a small nuclear weapon inside the United States homeland because they're – If someone detonates a dirty bomb inside the U.S., it is extremely hard to track down who did that and where it came from.
[01:21:39.409 --> 01:21:40.529]  And you can frame Russia.
[01:21:40.529 --> 01:21:43.550]  You can use radiation that has isotopes linked to Russian development.
[01:21:44.170 --> 01:21:46.350]  And you could frame both of them in collusion.
[01:21:46.529 --> 01:21:55.750]  And it would be very hard for independent free thinkers to debunk any of that because it would be so obfuscated and so complex to dig through.
[01:21:56.229 --> 01:21:58.130]  But that would escalate every...
[01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:59.390]  Because you can't redo 9-11.
[01:21:59.609 --> 01:22:00.390]  You can't, like...
[01:22:12.670 --> 01:22:14.070]  Yeah.
[01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:15.470]  Yeah.
[01:22:15.869 --> 01:22:15.909]  Yeah.
[01:22:18.970 --> 01:22:18.989]  Yeah.
[01:22:21.630 --> 01:22:23.029]  Yeah.
[01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:40.630]  And when you look at the drone story right now over New Jersey, it started to skew towards what seems likely is happening as they're scanning for nuclear radioactive material that either went missing from a container ship or possibly that has to do with other credible threats that they've received from overseas.
[01:22:40.630 --> 01:22:41.329]  It's hard to say.
[01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:44.729]  And we obviously don't know what's happening with the drones yet.
[01:22:45.279 --> 01:22:57.359]  But it seems like the discussion online has really honed in on the most likely answer is that they are doing a sweep for trying to detect a small nuclear weapon or at least radioactive material or something of that nature.
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:09.500]  So that's what's concerning to me is that we might actually be in a timeline where we need to be seriously concerned about a real terrorist attack on our homeland, which I would not assume would be coming from Iran.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:10.779]  They would not benefit from that.
[01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:13.479]  So we're coming up on a break in about two and a half minutes.
[01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:16.510]  And I want to just say this provocative thing.
[01:23:16.569 --> 01:23:21.210]  You're not going to have time to respond to it before we go to break, but just I want you to think about it because this is what's on my mind.
[01:23:22.670 --> 01:23:29.489]  March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones said that they were going to fly planes into the World Trade Center on his broadcast.
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:35.840]  July 25th, I believe, 2001, he said that they were going to blame it on Osama bin Laden.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.960]  Now, I don't know that he was the first person to say that they were going to blame it on Osama bin Laden.
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.859]  I think William Cooper might have had something to do with it, too.
[01:23:40.939 --> 01:23:41.420]  It's confusing.
[01:23:41.539 --> 01:23:42.439]  There's controversy around that.
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:43.100]  It doesn't even matter.
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:48.279]  The point I'm trying to make is, you've got an Alex Jones in March of 2001 saying they're going to fly planes to the World Trade Center.
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:56.500]  You've got an Alex Jones in July of 2001 literally telling people to call the White House and tell them that they're not falling for it when it happens.
[01:23:57.260 --> 01:23:59.119]  And then it happens, and...
[01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:05.149]  Turns out the fact that he came stumbling out of the desert predicting the truth wasn't enough, right?
[01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:07.789]  Smaller audience back then, 23 years ago.
[01:24:08.069 --> 01:24:17.010]  The question is, we're broadcasting every day talking about things like false flags, psyops, concerns about the inauguration, talking about dirty bombs.
[01:24:17.109 --> 01:24:23.569]  We've been talking about this, the missing nuclear weapons from Soviet era that one of them might have made it into the United States based on some reports that we've seen.
[01:24:24.609 --> 01:24:26.149]  Is the dynamic now...
[01:24:27.610 --> 01:24:46.750]  Different enough compared to 2001 that our predictions and our broadcasts are powerful enough and the legacy media is weakened enough that this time, if they try to detonate a dirty bomb, if they try to institute a false flag, people won't fall for it because they fell for it in 2001 and they sold out all of their rights by supporting things like the Patriot Act,
[01:24:46.890 --> 01:24:52.050]  by allowing things like people like Edward Snowden to have to escape to Moscow for standing up and blowing the whistle.
[01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:53.770]  I mean, there were neocons.
[01:24:54.479 --> 01:24:58.859]  Family friends of mine that were telling me at dinner conversations they thought he was a traitor.
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:00.680]  He was really a hero for what he did.
[01:25:00.699 --> 01:25:02.020]  It was our own act that was the problem.
[01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:18.420]  My concern is whether or not we have accumulated enough power, enough influence, enough reach to keep people at a critical mass of enough people to not allow this false fight to happen.
[01:25:18.539 --> 01:25:22.960]  Because the fact of the matter is You have to have buy-in to something like this.
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:26.279]  Gorbachev said the perception of our power is our power.
[01:25:26.479 --> 01:25:28.380]  All authoritarians have to control the narrative.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.239]  And do we have enough reach?
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:38.640]  Are we having enough impact to stop the next false flag from getting us into World War III? Folks, stick with us for more on the other side from Ian Carroll.

[01:27:35.710 --> 01:27:52.270]  Everything's there right now at Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host of The Alex Jones Show today, joined by Ian Carroll, known on X's at Ian Carroll Show.
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:59.100]  Content creator and investigative journalist who focuses on uncovering conspiracy theories and discussing corruption, media biases, and global control structures.
[01:27:59.279 --> 01:28:00.779]  I highly recommend you follow him.
[01:28:00.939 --> 01:28:05.000]  His content has been, and I'm not just saying this to kiss his ass, it's so impressive.
[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:12.439]  It's so cool, and you can learn a thing or two by watching how he does it because he uses all the tools that you have, a phone, and does amazing work, but...
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:24.399]  At the end of the last segment, we got into the question of whether or not our reach as alternative media has reached a critical mass big enough to prevent another false flag from happening.
[01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:27.659]  In 2001, for months, Alex was saying 9-11 was going to happen.
[01:28:27.819 --> 01:28:28.460]  It happened.
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:32.399]  Nobody even noticed that he'd been predicting it until years later when people went back in the archives.
[01:28:32.579 --> 01:28:38.380]  Now, we reach millions more people a day and there's Thousands of us.
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:39.579]  It's not just Alex Jones anymore.
[01:28:39.739 --> 01:28:46.520]  It's Ian Carroll's and Chase Geyser's and Tucker Carlson's and others, Nick Sorters, who are independently doing this, reaching more than the legacy media.
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.680]  Hopefully the critical mass is there.
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:58.479]  But I want to segue specifically into this UAP story, this drone story, because it centers around this dirty bomb, false flag theory, for lack of a better term.
[01:28:59.239 --> 01:29:02.439]  And one of the things I had the crew print out for me are these articles.
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:04.220]  You guys can go to the overhead cam website.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:12.479]  We're good to go.
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:40.039]  Because I hate paying taxes when we fund Nazis in Ukraine, given that my grandfather fought in World War II. And I was joking, because I haven't paid the IRS since Joe Biden has been in office, that if they force me to pay them, I'll just attach a ham radio to a balloon,
[01:29:40.039 --> 01:29:44.779]  so they have to spend the money that I owe them on a missile to shoot it down, you know?
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:47.800]  But obviously...
[01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:57.550]  This excuse that Mayorkas and others are using where we don't have the authority to shoot down these drones is BS because just a couple of years ago we spent two million dollars on the drop of a hat shooting down the Chinese balloons.
[01:29:58.310 --> 01:30:03.850]  What is going on in your mind based on the recent developments with the thousands of drone sightings?
[01:30:05.049 --> 01:30:12.029]  Real quickly on the topic of those balloons, Amaryllis Fox just did a Tucker Carlson interview within the last month or so.
[01:30:12.850 --> 01:30:19.449]  She is a very highly decorated ex-CIA officer who is now married to RFK Jr.'s son, Bobby.
[01:30:19.449 --> 01:30:20.630]  Yeah, she was his campaign manager.
[01:30:21.010 --> 01:30:21.789]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:30:22.050 --> 01:30:25.109]  And that interview was so fascinating on so many levels.
[01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:26.390]  I highly recommend people watch it.
[01:30:26.489 --> 01:30:33.210]  And she posited that those balloons were the exact delivery mechanism with which one would deliver an EMP device.
[01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:37.010]  And so there might be more to that story than met the eye at the time.
[01:30:37.109 --> 01:30:43.390]  Not to suggest that they were trying to deliver an EMP device at that time, but maybe testing weapon systems that would be how...
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:45.359]  We've had weird outages over the last three years.
[01:30:45.439 --> 01:30:48.659]  AT&T down one day, airlines down another day, internet services.
[01:30:48.659 --> 01:30:49.760]  Do they blame it on solar weather?
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:50.960]  It could be an EMP attack.
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:31:03.159]  Yeah, grid vulnerability is such a wild and dark rabbit hole that everyone should go down and educate themselves about, not only in terms of how vulnerable are we and what would happen, but what would you do if the grid went down around you?
[01:31:03.239 --> 01:31:13.960]  Because that's one of the most present and real apocalyptic scenarios that you might have to deal with just because of a storm, but you also might have to deal with because of a real attack or a false flag or whatever.
[01:31:14.899 --> 01:31:23.369]  But this drone story right now has broken in some really weird ways in the sense that it was happening It's been happening for a lot longer than most people have been paying attention to it.
[01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:30.449]  And it's escalated in some really strange ways, but our government has stayed radically silent on it in a really weird way.
[01:31:30.729 --> 01:31:37.689]  And it's not like the weather balloons were a few balloons that no one would have noticed, but it became a news cycle and then they shot it down.
[01:31:37.909 --> 01:31:44.109]  This is hundreds and hundreds, thousands even, of drones every night all over the eastern seaboard.
[01:31:44.250 --> 01:31:52.050]  And actually, apparently, globally now, although I'm a little skeptical of some of that, Rosie O'Donnell says there are drones in China.
[01:31:52.829 --> 01:31:53.510]  Yeah, right?
[01:31:53.710 --> 01:31:54.050]  They're aliens.
[01:31:55.390 --> 01:31:57.050]  There's drones in South America now.
[01:31:57.210 --> 01:31:57.930]  There's drones in China.
[01:31:58.090 --> 01:32:05.050]  And to me, I would want to do a ton of research into all of those claims to make sure that those are real.
[01:32:05.069 --> 01:32:09.850]  Because to me, that feels like trying to spin it as aliens or something like that when these are clearly not alien crafts.
[01:32:09.930 --> 01:32:10.689]  These are clearly drones.
[01:32:10.829 --> 01:32:13.649]  And I believe that there are alien crafts out there.
[01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:15.270]  They move very differently than this.
[01:32:15.369 --> 01:32:19.090]  And these guys are not moving anything like the strange UAPs that we can't explain.
[01:32:19.279 --> 01:32:19.539]  Right.
[01:32:19.699 --> 01:32:23.460]  There's no 90 degree angles disappearing and reappearing 500 miles away.
[01:32:24.039 --> 01:32:31.340]  Mach 10. But these are flying a very regular patterned grid sweep.
[01:32:31.779 --> 01:32:33.260]  With red and green lights flashing.
[01:32:33.690 --> 01:32:40.090]  Yeah, and so everything that we're doing right now is basically speculation because there's no real evidence.
[01:32:40.250 --> 01:32:42.810]  And people have been asking, why are they flying only at night?
[01:32:42.909 --> 01:32:52.489]  And to me, the obvious answer to that seems like because that way they can obfuscate where they're coming from and returning to at the beginning and end of each flight because during the day it would be pretty easy to track them down.
[01:32:52.609 --> 01:32:53.989]  So they're flying with lights on.
[01:32:54.449 --> 01:32:58.989]  The only reason I can imagine why they're flying with lights on is to protect our air traffic.
[01:32:59.050 --> 01:33:01.510]  And so they don't cause any traffic collisions.
[01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:02.609]  But then...
[01:33:02.770 --> 01:33:06.689]  If you want it to be undetected, if it was a foreign government, they would not be flying with lights on.
[01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:07.989]  They wanted us to notice it.
[01:33:08.770 --> 01:33:09.130]  Exactly.
[01:33:09.369 --> 01:33:16.250]  It's either lights are on for a false flag distraction, like draw attention to it, everyone talk about it, or just for basic security.
[01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:21.989]  But then if a dirty bomb goes off at the inauguration on January 20th, they can say, that's what we were looking for.
[01:33:22.130 --> 01:33:22.989]  Sorry we didn't find it.
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:24.279]  Bingo, right?
[01:33:24.479 --> 01:33:31.739]  So these are the concerns I have, is that it feels like it's a compartmentalized operation within our own government that's running these things.
[01:33:31.899 --> 01:33:39.640]  And it feels like the compartmentalization, we, the main question in my mind is, is it the good guys or the bad guys running this?
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:47.680]  Because there was one, you know, trust me bro story online where That Space Force was in charge of these drones and that it's a secret operation that they're running ahead of the inauguration.
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:56.800]  There's other trust me bro stories online that this is like a current administration running a sweep looking for nuclear material that was lost from the shipping container.
[01:33:58.079 --> 01:34:00.439]  Do you know the shipping container thing I'm talking about?
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:01.420]  No, please.
[01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:08.380]  So there was a shipping container that arrived damaged, I believe, in the port of New Jersey a couple days ago, and a report was released about it.
[01:34:08.579 --> 01:34:10.640]  Yes, actually, overhead cam here.
[01:34:10.699 --> 01:34:11.520]  I think I've got it here.
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:18.239]  I don't remember the exact nuclear isotope that it was, but I looked into that radioactive isotope.
[01:34:18.489 --> 01:34:22.569]  It is less than a CAT-3, as is stated in the text there.
[01:34:22.850 --> 01:34:25.970]  It's used for radiology, for doing CAT scans.
[01:34:26.069 --> 01:34:32.529]  And when you look into that specific material that was lost, it doesn't get used in dirty bombs.
[01:34:32.529 --> 01:34:35.609]  It's not weaponizable, as far as I'm aware.
[01:34:35.729 --> 01:34:36.369]  I'm no expert.
[01:34:36.409 --> 01:34:37.810]  I would love an expert opinion on that.
[01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:45.670]  But all the basic research I could do showed that that nuclear material that went missing would be a really weird thing to run this drone operation in search of.
[01:34:45.789 --> 01:34:50.649]  Well, there was 60,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate that disappeared the last couple of years.
[01:34:50.649 --> 01:34:52.189]  Remember that train that was on its way to California?
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:53.399]  Bingo.
[01:34:53.619 --> 01:34:55.840]  Those are the kinds of things that I would be far more curious about.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.100]  And so the timing of that report being released, that's a weird report to release.
[01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:06.180]  And it's released right as soon as the internet starts to hone in on this, they're searching for nuclear material story, right?
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:15.520]  And so to me, that report feels a lot like a misdirection away from whatever they're actually looking for, or sort of an explanation of like, yeah, you could like...
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:18.100]  And it bolsters the World War III narrative that they're trying to push.
[01:35:45.399 --> 01:35:45.500]  It does, yeah.
[01:35:45.729 --> 01:35:52.890]  Let's just really quickly remind ourselves how insane and prescient it was that Alex predicted 9-11 before it happened.
[01:35:53.149 --> 01:36:12.300]  And to get to your original question back about that is that I think that the media landscape is drastically different today, and we are more prepared not just in the sense that Infowars has a much larger audience, for example, But I think the really important piece that we have today that we didn't have back in 2001 is the network effect of the alternative media.
[01:36:12.539 --> 01:36:19.800]  In that last time, you know, 24 years, 25 years ago, Alex Jones was sort of an island, and he was acting all alone.
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:24.359]  And he reached a lot of people, but he was not tied in and allied with a lot of people.
[01:36:24.739 --> 01:36:40.409]  In the same way that today, like, especially with the new incoming administration, if just Alex Jones, for example, makes a prediction that comes true, he now has, like, Elon Musk Right.
[01:36:41.710 --> 01:36:43.109]  Right.
[01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:45.369]  Right.
[01:36:57.810 --> 01:36:59.489]  And sort of cross-pollinate our theories.
[01:36:59.689 --> 01:37:06.789]  And so no longer is it a world where one person makes a prediction, and if it comes right, then they have to scream about it for five, ten years to get that noticed.
[01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:10.590]  Now everyone's watching everyone's predictions, and we're all trying to figure it out together.
[01:37:10.829 --> 01:37:15.989]  And the vast majority of Americans have one alternative media source or the other.
[01:37:16.199 --> 01:37:19.220]  A lot of people don't watch Alex Jones, but they might watch Tucker Carlson.
[01:37:19.359 --> 01:37:21.340]  Or they might watch Breaking Points with Crystal Insider.
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:23.600]  Or their son or daughter might watch Alex Jones.
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:28.659]  So even though they're still watching Fox News, whenever Thanksgiving or Christmas happens, they're still even indirectly getting the news.
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.119]  But I want to show you this clip.
[01:37:30.239 --> 01:37:31.460]  Ian, I'm not sure if you've seen it.
[01:37:31.539 --> 01:37:37.220]  This is clip number 33. Cliff High apparently uploaded this on October 17th.
[01:37:37.279 --> 01:37:38.060]  I'm not sure if the date.
[01:37:38.729 --> 01:37:49.390]  Is exactly right, but I do know that he uploaded this before this phenomenon with UFOs, drones started happening because I was following him and looking into it before it happened personally.
[01:37:49.649 --> 01:38:02.369]  But this is clip number 33. It's just a minute and 17 seconds long of Cliff High basically predicting that within the next month or two from the time this video was uploaded that we would be experiencing massive traffic in the skies.
[01:38:02.369 --> 01:38:02.810]  Let's watch.
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:21.079]  Barely over a month between the temporal marker and the visible contention that will appear in the skies that from the descriptors we had back in 2009 will go to the idea of UFO versus UFO and UFO versus jets.
[01:38:21.779 --> 01:38:26.859]  Okay, so like a sort of very complex kind of Independence Day kind of shit, right?
[01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:30.460]  Nobody will know who the hell is doing what with whom.
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:38.279]  Okay, so you think that's unlikely and so on, as do I. All this shit's always unlikely until it happens.
[01:38:39.119 --> 01:38:42.319]  You know, possible, not probable, right?
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:51.119]  So anyway, now we have a strange thing where there's swarms of 20-foot drones flying around military bases.
[01:38:51.739 --> 01:38:52.859]  So, unknown.
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:55.680]  Nobody knows who owns these drones, who's controlling them.
[01:38:55.859 --> 01:38:57.479]  At least they're not telling us, guys.
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:13.920]  I would suspect that they, you know, the military would be freaking out if they can't see the signals that are directing those drones, and those drones are a, what is it, a KVAS, a KVAS weapon, where one of the,
[01:39:14.279 --> 01:39:21.739]  okay, so, yeah, I won't describe it, but basically you set off a group of drones that don't report back to headquarters until they're all done.
[01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:32.369]  And before this video, before that specific upload, I don't know if it was months ago or years ago, but it was definitely completely detached from the beginning of the phenomena manifesting.
[01:39:33.260 --> 01:39:38.779]  He predicted that there was going to be something like this that happened based on the models he uses.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.880]  And I've just discovered Cliff High.
[01:39:41.079 --> 01:39:43.579]  I don't understand or totally grasp.
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:56.600]  I'm not familiar enough with him to say, but my understanding is that he created some very sophisticated models that were able to scan and analyze the zeitgeist of the internet and then extrapolate the patterns into what is likely to happen in the future.
[01:39:56.779 --> 01:40:01.539]  And he's had successful predictions in the past unrelated to this as well.
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:02.859]  Have you seen that clip or heard of Cliff High?
[01:40:03.359 --> 01:40:06.579]  I've not seen that clip or heard of him, but it makes perfect sense.
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:13.220]  And, you know, you need look no further than the way that the media does do sort of like predictive programming, predictive preparation.
[01:40:13.539 --> 01:40:32.199]  And it's easier to look in the past and look at the Iraq War as an example, where the groups that were planning the Iraq War The Clean Break Report writers of this world, those folks were disseminating that narrative into the media in many small ways for quite some time before the Iraq War to prime us and to prepare us.
[01:40:32.319 --> 01:40:39.500]  And so I don't doubt that you could write some sort of algorithm or predictive model that would sort of pick up on those little cues.
[01:40:39.739 --> 01:40:39.859]  Right.
[01:40:39.859 --> 01:40:44.399]  To the extent that information is manipulated, a model like that would be accurate.
[01:40:44.699 --> 01:40:49.060]  If it was really spontaneous and chaotic and random and just organic, it would be much less...
[01:40:49.670 --> 01:40:51.369]  That's the funny irony of it all, right?
[01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.970]  Wow.
[01:41:01.890 --> 01:41:31.979]  is some sort of fake alien invasion or some sort of fake war of the worlds or even just linking it to whatever fake false flag terrorist attack comes it could be any mixture of the three and that would be extremely difficult to deal with especially if it involved emp or an attack on the grid that would because really at this point taking down our communication networks like our decentralized communication networks That is one of the greatest plays that they could make right now because it would basically lock everyone into their own little silo.
[01:41:32.039 --> 01:41:38.039]  And however prepared we all are mentally, spiritually, physically, emotionally, we'd be left at that.
[01:41:38.039 --> 01:41:41.039]  And we would no longer be getting information for whatever period of time.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:51.119]  I assume that Elon Musk does not yet have infrastructure to replace the grid and the internet connections of the world at the snap of a finger, but...
[01:41:51.739 --> 01:41:58.119]  It kind of seems like he's trying to prepare for that because the grid threat is so great and dire.
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:04.600]  And a nuclear threat, a dirty bomb threat, could overlap with a grid threat in a lot of different ways.
[01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:08.439]  And I don't remember if it was last year, earlier this year, or the year before.
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:12.300]  Everything becomes a blur when you're on the front lines of the information war for so long.
[01:42:12.579 --> 01:42:20.399]  But they were teasing UAPs and UFOs On a massive scale, I mean, Sean Ryan was covering it.
[01:42:20.479 --> 01:42:21.960]  There were whistleblowers coming out to Congress.
[01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:30.300]  There were members of congressional committees that were coming out of classified meetings saying, oh, this seems like it's not human.
[01:42:30.739 --> 01:42:35.420]  Even the government was saying that these objects don't seem to be manmade.
[01:42:35.539 --> 01:42:37.899]  They teased that months or years ago.
[01:42:39.390 --> 01:42:41.590]  Massive viral reach, and then it disappeared.
[01:42:41.770 --> 01:42:42.850]  Everyone stopped talking about it.
[01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:49.670]  Now we have this phenomenon that everyone's experiencing at the same time with that seed having been planted from a couple of years ago.
[01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:51.949]  Do you think that was an intentional psychological campaign?
[01:42:53.130 --> 01:42:56.050]  This might be controversial, but I don't think so.
[01:42:56.229 --> 01:43:04.680]  I think halfway, in the sense that I'm of the persuasion based upon trying to look into all the evidence and all the whistleblowers and stuff.
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:12.520]  I'm of the persuasion that there's a lot of kernels of truth there and that there are UAPs and there are aliens involved in our history and our present-day storyline.
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:13.079]  But...
[01:43:14.579 --> 01:43:27.800]  I think there is a genuine disclosure push happening behind the scenes and in exactly the same way that they would have to control the media narrative about the war in the Middle East or the war in Ukraine, they need to control the media narrative around that disclosure as well.
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:31.399]  And I think that they do that by feeding into it and trying to redirect the stream.
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:38.260]  And I think that that's what we saw last year is they tried to make it look like the government was like pro-disclosure and then they redirect the stream.
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:48.470]  And I think that some sort of a Project Bluebeam or false flag, you know, fake alien attack Would go right in line with trying to control that narrative ahead of its actual timeline.
[01:43:48.789 --> 01:43:54.689]  Because I think that there are real legitimate actors out there, like the David Grush's, maybe the Stephen Greer's.
[01:43:54.869 --> 01:43:57.210]  Maybe it's hard to tell who is legit and who is not.
[01:43:57.390 --> 01:44:02.329]  But I think there are real actors out there with a lot of sway that are trying to get disclosure.
[01:44:02.329 --> 01:44:03.930]  It's just a very complicated situation.
[01:44:03.949 --> 01:44:07.310]  And mind-bending topic to disclose.
[01:44:07.590 --> 01:44:14.670]  I don't think regular Americans are even beginning to be prepared for what that means about our physical and our spiritual reality.
[01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:17.930]  Speaking of disclosure, this is a good segue.
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:22.619]  Whistleblower for open AI dies mysteriously.
[01:44:23.359 --> 01:44:27.880]  And it's not just because a whistleblower for a major corporation that dies mysteriously that this is interesting.
[01:44:28.039 --> 01:44:37.960]  It's because artificial intelligence is so relevant to the information war and the deep state dynamic with public relations and public psychology.
[01:44:38.159 --> 01:44:39.420]  AI is obviously getting very powerful.
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:48.399]  Elon Musk is saying we're 18 months or less away from artificial general intelligence, which is incredibly exciting and terrifying simultaneously, depending on what side of the fence you play on with that issue.
[01:44:50.019 --> 01:44:52.979]  So in the last few minutes that we have together, we have about seven minutes.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:57.100]  What happened with this OpenAI whistleblower?
[01:44:57.619 --> 01:45:11.119]  And what are your thoughts on OpenAI's transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit and some of its seeming conspiring with major corporations like Microsoft and the government?
[01:45:11.779 --> 01:45:16.840]  Yeah, well, it's not super clear yet because a lot of it has not been released.
[01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:21.989]  As far as I'm aware, the story kind of broke in a very delayed fashion.
[01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:30.409]  It feels like it took a week or two for people to notice that this suicide was this important person that was whistleblowing OpenAI.
[01:45:30.609 --> 01:45:34.890]  Or at least it took a minute for the traction to gain for people to start talking about it and everyone to start noticing.
[01:45:35.449 --> 01:45:50.250]  But this guy that had been working at OpenAI in various important positions had started to have concerns about the copyright claims that could be brought against OpenAI, and by extension himself, because he was working on this technology.
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:58.539]  In that open AI is basically just copying and regurgitating the works of everybody and not having...
[01:45:58.539 --> 01:46:00.960]  They use private intellectual property to train the models.
[01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:01.960]  Exactly.
[01:46:02.279 --> 01:46:07.600]  And a lot of times the outputs are not really significantly different than the inputs, which are copyrighted materials.
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:10.939]  And so when he started to talk and bring this...
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:14.939]  This sort of accusation, essentially, this concern.
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:20.640]  To the front, he was previously fired or left OpenAI.
[01:46:20.939 --> 01:46:21.760]  It's a little unclear.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.939]  I think he left, but it's a little unclear always.
[01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:29.060]  But then this copyright issue is not just a little whistleblow.
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:34.350]  This is a whistleblow on the fundamental nature of Of AI models in general.
[01:46:34.529 --> 01:46:37.630]  And this is like, we're talking trillions of dollars worth of lawsuit.
[01:46:37.930 --> 01:46:42.409]  And we're talking all of the multi-billion dollar valuation of open AI is on the line.
[01:46:42.569 --> 01:46:43.810]  Not to mention the special interests.
[01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:44.869]  Exactly.
[01:46:45.130 --> 01:46:54.050]  When you look at those special interests, open AI has been heavily tied to classified deep state government operative type of research for quite some time now.
[01:46:54.250 --> 01:47:01.189]  They have the ex-CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Susan Desmond Hellman, who is also on the board of Pfizer.
[01:47:01.409 --> 01:47:02.510]  They have Larry Summers, who is also on the board of Pfizer.
[01:47:02.539 --> 01:47:07.100]  We're good to go.
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:18.239]  We're good to go.
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:25.119]  Yeah.
[01:47:41.879 --> 01:47:44.979]  So, obviously, whistleblowers don't commit suicide.
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:54.979]  People that are going through the hard work and the danger that it takes to turn on everything that you've done and to gather evidence and to come out and to speak.
[01:47:55.119 --> 01:48:00.960]  This dude was scheduling interviews with mainstream news for the weeks following his, quote, suicide.
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:32.279]  And George Webb put together a really interesting connection that He did an interview with the New York Times shortly before he committed suicide quote unquote and it would not and this is just a theory I'm not not laying any accusations but it would not be the first time that a whistleblower has done a mainstream media news interview which was actually sort of a front for figuring out how much does this person really know because in an interview setting you're on the same time you're telling everything you know and then boom suddenly whoopsies he's dead And
[01:48:32.279 --> 01:48:34.920]  so just suspicious and worth looking into.
[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:42.960]  And I think, I hope that people like Elon will take an interest in this and people that have power, maybe the Kath Patels of this world, will actually dig in.
[01:48:43.079 --> 01:48:45.819]  Because this is not just a little dude with some small company.
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:49.720]  It's possible that the narrative is true and that he just was mentally ill and killed himself.
[01:48:49.859 --> 01:48:51.300]  So there's no way to know for sure.
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:53.100]  But one thing is for sure.
[01:48:53.659 --> 01:48:57.840]  It is very dangerous to be a credible whistleblower in the United States.
[01:48:58.079 --> 01:48:59.560]  Look what happened to Seth Rich.
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:04.420]  Look what happened to this CEO of this healthcare company that was just assassinated.
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:08.739]  Look what happened to Julian Assange who was almost killed and imprisoned forever.
[01:49:08.819 --> 01:49:12.239]  Look what happened to Edward Snowden who had to escape to Moscow all places.
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:21.670]  It is not a good place in the United States to be a whistleblower On organizations associated or intimately connected with the deep state as OpenAI is.
[01:49:21.810 --> 01:49:28.109]  So regardless of the truth of this specific story, there are definitely a lot of people that are very happy he's no longer with us.
[01:49:28.369 --> 01:49:40.689]  Yeah, we need whistleblower protections yesterday in America because if we all agree that America is deeply corrupt and that financial institutions, that corporations, that the deep state has its tentacles and everything.
[01:49:41.029 --> 01:49:46.329]  Then the way that we're going to fix that is by having people come out from the inside and tell us all the evil, corrupt things that they're doing.
[01:49:46.510 --> 01:49:47.390]  We need whistleblowers.
[01:49:47.529 --> 01:49:50.369]  And if we need whistleblowers, we need protections for whistleblowers.
[01:49:50.489 --> 01:49:53.750]  So we should make that a rallying cry in the Trump administration.
[01:49:53.750 --> 01:50:01.250]  And I would hope that we can because a lot of the people that are coming in have either been wronged by the deep state or framed by the deep state or set up in other ways.
[01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:05.689]  And so if we can't protect our whistleblowers, then we don't deserve freedom, right?
[01:50:05.810 --> 01:50:15.000]  Like if we can't protect the people that are taking the risks to tell us how evil the world is, Then we have not yet made the leap to stand for freedom that we need to make.
[01:50:15.979 --> 01:50:18.359]  You didn't even mention the Boeing whistleblowers.
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:21.920]  There's too many to name and too many to count.
[01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:25.159]  Yeah, and anybody who's been a chef for a Democratic administration the last 30 years.
[01:50:26.119 --> 01:50:26.520]  Exactly.
[01:50:27.859 --> 01:50:29.720]  Ian, it's been an honor and a pleasure to have you.
[01:50:29.819 --> 01:50:30.300]  You're welcome anytime.
[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:31.600]  I always enjoy our interactions.
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:34.720]  I encourage the audience to follow you at Ian Carroll Show.
[01:50:34.979 --> 01:50:35.960]  Thanks so much for your time today.
[01:50:36.619 --> 01:50:37.159]  Thank you, Chase.
[01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:38.100]  Always a pleasure, man.
[01:50:38.479 --> 01:50:38.819]  Absolutely.
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:45.060]  Next up, folks, we have Tom Sauer coming on to join us for the third hour of the broadcast.
[01:50:45.239 --> 01:50:46.659]  Make sure you stay tuned for that.
[01:50:46.659 --> 01:50:48.479]  We've got a break coming up in one minute.
[01:50:48.619 --> 01:50:58.460]  Tom Sauer, known on X's, Thomas B. Sauer, is a multifaceted individual with a diverse background, primarily centered around military service, entrepreneurship, and health services and public commentary.
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:05.460]  Tom Sauer is a former U.S. Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal Officer, having graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2006, according to Grok.
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:12.020]  We're good to go.
[01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:18.859]  We're good to go.
[01:51:23.490 --> 01:51:28.529]  For the next hour, in the meantime, please go to the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:51:28.590 --> 01:51:32.550]  Ian and I were talking about how important it is that we protect whistleblowers, that we have whistleblowers.
[01:51:32.649 --> 01:51:34.529]  Alex Jones has been blowing the whistle for 23 years.
[01:51:34.670 --> 01:51:36.670]  He blows the whistle before the crime even takes place.
[01:51:36.789 --> 01:51:38.869]  He doesn't wait for it to happen and then tell you that it happened.
[01:51:39.029 --> 01:51:40.729]  He says it's going to happen and then it happens.
[01:51:40.890 --> 01:51:45.770]  So please go to the AlexJonesStore.com, get any number of our products, supplements, t-shirts, coins.
[01:51:47.289 --> 01:51:53.069]  And not only will you benefit with your health, but you're fighting for humanity and freedom of speech and the truth itself.
[01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:54.050]  Stay tuned, folks.
[01:51:54.710 --> 01:51:57.890]  Christmas ornaments, drywall and Jerry Epstein.
[01:51:58.529 --> 01:52:00.989]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:52:02.210 --> 01:52:04.470]  There are three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:52:04.890 --> 01:52:08.050]  Drywall, Christmas tree lights, and Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:11.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in free fall.
[01:52:11.210 --> 01:52:13.069]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[01:52:13.529 --> 01:52:19.550]  Trump is officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal human trafficking and sex slavery.
[01:52:20.010 --> 01:52:22.850]  We're going to take control January 20th, and people are going to be held accountable.
[01:52:23.050 --> 01:52:24.250]  We're going to be very transparent.
[01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:25.350]  We're going to get behind.
[01:52:25.550 --> 01:52:28.789]  What did the United Nations have to do with the open border crisis?
[01:52:28.970 --> 01:52:30.550]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[01:52:30.670 --> 01:52:34.810]  We're going to be very transparent, American people, and we're going to tell them the truth of what happened on this border.
[01:52:34.949 --> 01:52:36.270]  Again, by design.
[01:52:36.449 --> 01:52:37.930]  And so much more has happened.
[01:52:38.029 --> 01:52:38.989]  This is an exciting time.
[01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:41.170]  But the globalists are striking back.
[01:52:41.310 --> 01:52:45.250]  That's why it's important to keep our operation on air now more than ever.
[01:52:45.369 --> 01:52:47.229]  And we can't do it without you.
[01:52:47.250 --> 01:52:48.210]  So we make it easy.

[01:53:07.829 --> 01:53:09.409]  And I personally love this one.

[01:53:13.329 --> 01:53:15.569]  And the family and friends will have so much fun.
[01:53:15.710 --> 01:53:16.869]  It's a great conversation piece.
[01:53:17.229 --> 01:53:18.810]  And this will horrify.
[01:53:19.329 --> 01:53:23.750]  Leftists, and then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall, shaking and fearing and walking on the street.
[01:53:23.890 --> 01:53:24.430]  Say, it's okay.
[01:53:24.869 --> 01:53:29.529]  Alex Jones doesn't bite, though it kind of does look like I'm Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.
[01:53:29.989 --> 01:53:36.149]  There's so many other great limited edition shirts, hoodies, sweaters right now.
[01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:39.630]  And then, of course, there's the Darth Sidious hoodies.
[01:53:40.250 --> 01:53:41.989]  Trump one, I'm afraid.

[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:08.420]  And I looked at it, and I was like, oh my God, this is the superfood other than maybe hemp.
[01:55:09.010 --> 01:55:10.430]  But it does other effects than him.

[01:55:38.850 --> 01:55:41.149]  Thanks for keeping me and President Trump with a fight.
[01:55:41.369 --> 01:55:42.409]  God bless and good luck.
[01:55:42.869 --> 01:55:44.069]  Oh, and I almost forgot.
[01:55:45.050 --> 01:55:46.949]  Merry, Merry Christmas to everybody.
[01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:49.989]  That's so triggering to the left, but I also love Christmas.
[01:55:50.350 --> 01:55:53.750]  And a Happy New Year with President Trump about to come into office.
[01:55:58.670 --> 01:56:09.750]  What's going on here is that the food industry has figured out that there's a combination of sweet, carbohydrate, and salt that goes to our brains and is very...
[01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:11.029]  I think it's addictive.
[01:56:11.189 --> 01:56:12.109]  Now, that's my opinion.
[01:56:12.130 --> 01:56:17.029]  And I think it's the same neural circuits that are involved in opioid addiction and other kinds of...
[01:56:20.929 --> 01:56:24.890]  That man that you just heard speak is a man named Dr. Califf.
[01:56:25.029 --> 01:56:35.229]  He's the current chief of the FDA appointed by Biden in 2021. So the Food and Drug Administrator admitted that our food isn't actually food, it's more like drugs.
[01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.670]  Ah!
[01:56:37.229 --> 01:56:42.750]  Him and his buddy here said some other wild stuff at this Senate health panel hearing on December 5th.
[01:56:42.869 --> 01:56:47.850]  One of the key things that they brought up was food dyes, which is the subject of today's video.
[01:56:48.029 --> 01:56:56.619]  A not often discussed reason as to why our American food system is just so addictive in nature is because of how colorful it is.
[01:56:56.739 --> 01:56:57.359]  Check this out.
[01:56:57.439 --> 01:57:10.659]  A 1982 study found that people perceive dark red beverages as tasting sweeter even when that sample and all of the other samples that they tried in the study had the same exact amount of sugar in it.
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:17.340]  Certain colors, like the one in that study, dark red, can literally change how we perceive our sense of taste.
[01:57:17.699 --> 01:57:30.600]  RED40 alone is found in over 36,000 American food products, and in some places you honestly wouldn't expect, like this ham and cheese cup at the grocery store, or this salmon salad, or this jar of ginger.
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:45.720]  The fact that RED40 is in 36,000 American food products would be a-okay if RED40 wasn't studied to cause ADHD in children, irritable bowel disease, and possibly cancer, amongst many other negative health effects.
[01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:47.539]  Don't take the black pill just yet.
[01:57:47.739 --> 01:57:54.300]  Our benevolent, loving, angelic overlords have been monitoring Red 40 day and night for our own safety.
[01:57:54.500 --> 01:58:00.779]  The FDA has a position that food coloring like 40 are safe for a kid's ingestion.
[01:58:00.939 --> 01:58:02.659]  Do both of you stand behind that?
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:06.060]  We have not evaluated Red 40 in over a decade.
[01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:07.239]  In over a decade.
[01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:08.460]  In over a decade.
[01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:10.659]  What would you say?
[01:58:11.630 --> 01:58:12.550]  You do hear.
[01:58:12.670 --> 01:58:21.770]  To make matters worse, the equally harmful Red Dye 3 was also brought up during this hearing, and this is what our benevolent, angelic overlords had to say about that.
[01:58:21.829 --> 01:58:26.029]  Red 3 has been known to cause cancer in cosmetics.
[01:58:26.729 --> 01:58:28.430]  But we still allow it to be put in our food.
[01:58:28.529 --> 01:58:29.409]  I don't understand that.
[01:58:29.529 --> 01:58:33.430]  So RED3 presents an interesting example for us.
[01:58:33.569 --> 01:58:38.310]  It is actually known to be cancer in laboratory animals, rats.
[01:58:38.649 --> 01:58:46.770]  But the scientific consensus is that the mechanism of carcinogenicity in In rats is not applicable in humans.
[01:58:46.949 --> 01:58:58.489]  However, any chemical that is shown to be carcinogenic in animals or humans, or should I say humans or animals, cannot be authorized by FDA. It's called the Delaney Clause.
[01:58:58.770 --> 01:59:09.720]  And so even though we don't believe there is a risk to humans under the Delaney Clause of the FFDCA, Red dye, because it is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals, should not be authorized.
[01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:16.760]  And so that is what has been challenged FDA for many years, is how to manage around the Delaney Clause.
[01:59:16.859 --> 01:59:23.500]  So what he just said there was completely insane, and I'm going to help you understand some of the wizard talk that you just heard there.
[01:59:23.699 --> 01:59:29.600]  The FDA doesn't authorize anything in our food supply if it's found to cause cancer in humans or animals.
[01:59:29.779 --> 01:59:46.239]  This is due to the regulation he talked about called the Delaney Clause, which was first enacted in 1958. So what's so puzzling about what he just said in front of the Senate is that red dye number three was found to cause cancer in rats in the year 1990. So when they found that out,
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:47.319]  they banned it.
[01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:50.890]  But only for cosmetics, not the food supply.
[01:59:51.090 --> 01:59:53.409]  They only followed the Delaney clause halfway.
[01:59:53.729 --> 02:00:00.010]  They should have banned it in everything if it causes cancer in rats because that's what the Delaney clause says.
[02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:18.210]  So it should be a huge slap in your face when you hear this guy admit right in front of the Senate That it's a challenge to the FDA to manage around the Delaney Clause when the Delaney Clause is one of the few things that keeps us safe from cancer-causing chemicals.
[02:00:18.409 --> 02:00:19.270]  These people hate you.
[02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:20.189]  But here's the good news.
[02:00:20.289 --> 02:00:24.829]  Because of massive public backlash, they're actually looking at banning these food dyes now.
[02:00:24.949 --> 02:00:25.970]  Which is a huge victory.
[02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:36.289]  Soon, man-made horrors beyond your comprehension like this Captain Crunch Blue Ocean syrup abomination may soon just vanish from the grocery shelves.
[02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:42.670]  But banning a few harmful ingredients and products isn't going to take you across the finish line in your own health journey.
[02:00:42.789 --> 02:00:43.630]  That's just a fact.
[02:00:43.890 --> 02:00:47.670]  You still have to exercise your free will and make better choices.
[02:00:47.930 --> 02:00:53.130]  A good rule of thumb that I personally follow is to just stay away from processed food as much as you can.
[02:00:53.159 --> 02:00:55.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:55.699 --> 02:01:01.880]  I am Chase Geiser, your host for the remainder of the show until the great Owen Schroyer takes over with the War Room at 3 p.m.
[02:01:02.020 --> 02:01:03.399]  Central Time until 6 p.m.
[02:01:03.939 --> 02:01:04.380]  Central Time.
[02:01:04.579 --> 02:01:15.939]  We are joined right now by Tom Sauer, known on X as Thomas B. Sauer, multifaceted individual with a diverse background, primarily centered around military service, entrepreneurship, and health services and public commentary.
[02:01:16.359 --> 02:01:18.859]  Tom, it's an honor and a pleasure to have you on the show.
[02:01:18.979 --> 02:01:22.399]  Thank you so much for agreeing to come on with your time on such short notice.
[02:01:23.210 --> 02:01:24.630]  Hey, thanks for having me, Chase.
[02:01:24.750 --> 02:01:25.609]  Really appreciate it.
[02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:29.390]  And pretty impressed you were able to figure out all that stuff about me so easily.
[02:01:29.550 --> 02:01:30.289]  It was Grock, man.
[02:01:30.470 --> 02:01:31.090]  It was Grock.
[02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:34.130]  I just put in your handle on Grock and I said, tell me about this guy and they spit it all out.
[02:01:34.930 --> 02:01:35.489]  That's great.
[02:01:35.710 --> 02:01:36.069]  That's great.
[02:01:36.630 --> 02:01:47.470]  So the reason I wanted to have you on is because I saw Joe Rogan post the nine minute clip of this CEO of a drone contracting company, military contractor.
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:58.880]  And it was a nine minute clip of him saying that there had been reports of a Soviet-era Ukrainian nuclear weapon that had gone missing and maybe these drones are being used to detect radiation.
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:05.310]  I saw your comment Saying basically, look, there's other ways that they can detect radiation without flying drones all over the place.
[02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:23.710]  And so because of your background and because of the great work that you do that I want to also show a light on, I wanted to ask you or get your insight, your intel, your credible expertise for the sake of the audience and myself on why or what you think about the argument around this is radiation detecting.
[02:02:24.989 --> 02:02:27.770]  So I don't believe that that's the case.
[02:02:27.970 --> 02:02:31.510]  Now, that doesn't mean I know the answer as to what's going on.
[02:02:32.590 --> 02:02:38.630]  So what I did in my previous life, so to speak, I was a Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal Officer.
[02:02:38.630 --> 02:02:44.890]  I was attached to a Special Operations Task Force, which was actually based out of Japan.
[02:02:45.170 --> 02:02:53.939]  We were the regional, what was called the Commanders in Extremis Force, the SIF. Nowadays, I think they call it the CRIF, the Crisis Response Force.
[02:02:54.119 --> 02:02:58.819]  And it's meant to be a quick reaction in theater, in the Pacific region.
[02:02:59.060 --> 02:03:01.000]  Every region has one assigned to it.
[02:03:01.539 --> 02:03:03.859]  And they were there for counterterrorism.
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:05.399]  So this was for major events.
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:11.399]  So this is a major hostage situation or some sort of a terrorist act.
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:17.590]  And then if you think about it, what is the Biggest terrorist threat out there, right?
[02:03:17.789 --> 02:03:32.090]  And really, if you think about it, the biggest terrorist threat would be a WMD, brought into either one of our friends' countries, whether Europe, Australia, Japan, or into the United States, God forbid.
[02:03:32.829 --> 02:03:38.869]  And we were a supporting element of JSOC, Joint Special Operations Command, right?
[02:03:38.970 --> 02:03:40.489]  And so you can...
[02:03:40.949 --> 02:03:51.569]  Without giving anything away too much, you could probably read on the internet about what Joint Special Operations Command does, and you would probably find something about how it's the premier counterterrorism force.
[02:03:51.970 --> 02:04:01.229]  And that includes—and Joint Special Operations Command owns SEAL Team 6, Delta Force, a couple other units that you might not have heard of, right?
[02:04:01.390 --> 02:04:04.409]  And then also below, those are considered the Tier 1 units.
[02:04:04.510 --> 02:04:10.189]  The unit I was attached to was what's— Colloquially referred to as a tier two unit, right?
[02:04:10.329 --> 02:04:17.289]  We kind of make the joke that my unit, what we did, we were discount Delta Force, diet dev group, right?
[02:04:17.449 --> 02:04:19.350]  But we were actually a very capable unit.
[02:04:19.569 --> 02:04:25.109]  And so we were able to do a lot, but I went through a ton of training as an EOD officer, right?
[02:04:25.329 --> 02:04:30.010]  We still know how to shoot, jump, dive, do all the cool guy things, right?
[02:04:30.289 --> 02:04:34.710]  But most of our training is focused on defeating terrorist explosive threats.
[02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:44.239]  And what is, again, what is the biggest terrorist threat would be a loose WMD, particularly a nuclear device, right?
[02:04:44.579 --> 02:04:45.199]  And so...
[02:04:45.199 --> 02:04:53.100]  And just for the sake of myself and the audience, how many unaccounted for nuclear weapons are there estimated to be?
[02:04:54.859 --> 02:04:56.500]  You'd be surprised how few.
[02:04:56.899 --> 02:04:57.399]  Okay.
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:00.300]  Because, you know, believe it or not, and what's one thing I learned...
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:00.920]  But there are some...
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:09.140]  I'm not really sure, to be honest, but I actually was surprised to learn that there was very good accountability.
[02:05:09.539 --> 02:05:13.920]  I mean, I can't even find my keys, so I can't imagine what happened after the Soviet Union collapsed.
[02:05:14.079 --> 02:05:14.180]  Right.
[02:05:14.539 --> 02:05:19.479]  But one of the things I learned that was really interesting was that there are...
[02:05:19.479 --> 02:05:26.899]  I didn't even know about it until I got into this unit and I got the full read-in to the programs that I was involved in.
[02:05:27.550 --> 02:05:43.210]  And I was actually very pleasantly surprised to learn that there are very large, well-funded, very well-funded, well-organized organizations that are dedicated almost entirely to preventing this sort of a thing.
[02:05:44.189 --> 02:05:52.270]  So I think you showed a picture there of when Carl Brashear pulled a lost nuclear weapon, I think it's off the coast of Spain a long time ago.
[02:05:52.590 --> 02:05:53.770]  I believe that, yeah.
[02:05:54.320 --> 02:05:56.920]  So, one thing that's interesting, yeah, I think that's what that is right there.
[02:05:57.039 --> 02:06:00.420]  It's where Karl Bashir lost his leg, I believe, if that's the case, in Palomar's weapon, yeah.
[02:06:00.739 --> 02:06:03.020]  Karl Bashir from the movie Men of Honor, right?
[02:06:03.439 --> 02:06:04.939]  Yeah, he's a real guy.
[02:06:06.119 --> 02:06:09.220]  So, I was actually pretty surprised by a lot of this.
[02:06:09.319 --> 02:06:11.560]  And we've got a ton of capability now.
[02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:20.659]  And we've got very, and I learned this my time at Los Alamos National Lab, which is where, you know, that's where nuclear weapons came from, right?
[02:06:20.859 --> 02:06:21.920]  And where they're first tested.
[02:06:22.279 --> 02:06:27.140]  And the lab there today does a lot of work almost entirely around nuclear weapons.
[02:06:27.639 --> 02:06:30.760]  So I got to see, like, the plutonium production facility.
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:35.500]  Like, there is a place where we actually manufacture the pits, the cores, the plutonium.
[02:06:35.699 --> 02:06:37.319]  Got to hold plutonium in my hand.
[02:06:37.319 --> 02:06:38.020]  It was wild.
[02:06:38.140 --> 02:06:39.300]  I mean, it really was very impressive.
[02:06:40.159 --> 02:06:42.800]  And because of that, that's all owned by the Department of Energy.
[02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:45.960]  So you have to get a separate clearance called a Q clearance, right?
[02:06:46.060 --> 02:06:50.859]  So you can have access to what's called SINWIDI, Critical Nuclear Weapons Design Information, right?
[02:06:50.979 --> 02:06:56.220]  So we learned a lot about how nuclear weapons actually function and work.
[02:06:56.319 --> 02:07:10.770]  And also in the event of a, let's say, a bad guy is trying to sneak one into the country about how to determine, one, like confirm or deny that In other words, hey, is this actually a nuclear weapon?
[02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:14.890]  And if it is, let's say it's something homemade, right?
[02:07:14.989 --> 02:07:21.289]  For example, there's a Pakistani scientist named A.Q. Khan who sold blueprints like plants.
[02:07:21.310 --> 02:07:23.949]  Here's how you could DIY nuclear weapon.
[02:07:24.449 --> 02:07:27.630]  And somebody tried something like that, right?
[02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:38.000]  But we would be able to confirm or deny whether or not it actually was a nuclear weapon and if it would actually produce a nuclear yield.
[02:07:39.260 --> 02:07:44.500]  And then we end up talking to folks at Department of Energy, Joint Special Operations Command, White House.
[02:07:44.659 --> 02:07:45.880]  We do these exercises.
[02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:50.619]  I spent a lot of time in Australia, New Zealand, practicing with those partner countries.
[02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:55.680]  If somebody tried to sneak a nuke into Australia or into New Zealand, let's say.
[02:07:56.500 --> 02:08:02.560]  Because not all developed countries have the same capabilities that we have, right?
[02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:04.420]  So we train them, help them out.
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:09.279]  So that's where I learned that, whoa, there's some really advanced ways to detect them.
[02:08:09.380 --> 02:08:11.079]  And we have them in the States too.
[02:08:11.460 --> 02:08:13.659]  And a lot of them is like seen and unseen.
[02:08:13.659 --> 02:08:18.180]  For example, coming into the ports, almost all of our ports have radiation monitors.
[02:08:19.119 --> 02:08:20.239]  Here, I'll give you a fun example.
[02:08:20.239 --> 02:08:21.119]  Is there any way to mask it though?
[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:23.479]  Can you surround a nuclear weapon in lead or something like that?
[02:08:24.449 --> 02:08:25.170]  You can.
[02:08:25.369 --> 02:08:40.729]  And actually, that's also one of the tougher parts where if it's an actual nuclear warhead, they are not, as we would say, hot, as radioactive, as like a radiological dispersal device, aka a dirty bomb, right?
[02:08:41.029 --> 02:08:58.550]  So because the purpose of an RDD, we call an RDD, a dirty bomb, is Is simply to spread dangerous radioactive material all over the place, and if it was done correctly, it can make an area uninhabitable for decades,
[02:08:58.770 --> 02:08:58.890]  centuries.
[02:08:58.890 --> 02:09:01.130]  Sure, especially if it hits the water supply, things like that.
[02:09:03.230 --> 02:09:19.090]  We're good to go.
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:28.100]  So, the thing is, though, is that we focus...
[02:09:28.100 --> 02:09:33.640]  Now, I can tell you that right now, and this is, like, without me giving up anything too classified or anything like that, but...
[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:34.420]  Sorry, I can't.
[02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:35.279]  I just don't want to get in trouble.
[02:09:35.380 --> 02:09:35.699]  I understand.
[02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:37.859]  So, yeah, is...
[02:09:38.609 --> 02:09:49.109]  Is we focus not so much on, we focus a lot on stuff at the homeland, but we really push it out, as in what we refer to as upstream defeat, right?
[02:09:49.289 --> 02:09:56.930]  As in, we are over there, we are in other countries, we are watching the sea lanes, if anything were to come in on a container ship or something like that.
[02:09:57.170 --> 02:10:01.489]  But I'll give you a fun example of here in the state, one of the ways that we do this, right?
[02:10:02.719 --> 02:10:17.899]  Have you ever been on a major interstate highway, especially if you're near a port city like Baltimore or Jacksonville, Florida is a good example, where as soon as I leave, I'm going north from Jacksonville up 95. And for some reason,
[02:10:17.939 --> 02:10:20.600]  I see all this road construction, but there's no actual construction.
[02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:25.380]  And there'd be nothing but orange barrels just funneling all traffic into one lane.
[02:10:26.239 --> 02:10:33.340]  And it's just barrels and barrels and barrels, but you don't see any backhoes or bulldozers or people working or anything like that.
[02:10:33.479 --> 02:10:34.380]  It's just holding up traffic.
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:39.439]  Well, I'm just saying you could fit radiation monitors inside those barrels.
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:40.239]  I see.
[02:10:40.439 --> 02:10:40.619]  Multiple ones.
[02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:43.159]  So you create a bottleneck and you can scan every vehicle.
[02:10:43.619 --> 02:10:47.539]  And if a truck goes by, it'll ping, ping, ping, ping, ping.
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:48.760]  It'll let folks know.
[02:10:49.300 --> 02:10:54.699]  But, for example, though, we actually do spend a lot of time on, again, upstream defeat.
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:58.619]  So instead, we're overseas watching everything, right?
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:10:59.760]  So it's like proactive.
[02:10:59.819 --> 02:11:02.659]  You're trying to find the device before it even makes it here.
[02:11:04.190 --> 02:11:05.149]  Exactly, right?
[02:11:05.329 --> 02:11:06.189]  And keeping track of them.
[02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:11.850]  So there is an entire organization called DITRA, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, right?
[02:11:12.029 --> 02:11:29.779]  DITRA. And they partner with Department of Energy, which, by the way, guys, I'm not sure if everyone knows this, but when people talk about DOE, Department of Energy, like, the actual infrastructure of producing electricity and energy and sending it out into the country,
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.979]  that is an afterthought, right?
[02:11:32.199 --> 02:11:35.760]  Like, the real purpose of DOE, Department of Energy, is nuclear weapons.
[02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:43.399]  That is, I mean, it is, the Department of Energy is the direct descendant of the Manhattan Project, right?
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:44.859]  I mean, and that's not anything, right?
[02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:46.340]  That's just, if you look it up, right?
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.239]  So DOE exists for nuclear weapons.
[02:11:50.399 --> 02:11:52.979]  The power grid is very secondary.
[02:11:52.979 --> 02:11:54.020]  It's an afterthought.
[02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:59.159]  So that's why DOE owns most of the national labs, where we make everything.
[02:11:59.159 --> 02:12:00.840]  It's a completely different entity.
[02:12:01.239 --> 02:12:10.680]  And so DITRA works with DOE and DOD to basically keep track of where any potential weapon is.
[02:12:12.079 --> 02:12:16.300]  I got a lot of interesting briefs and stuff that I can't really talk about, obviously.
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:21.979]  I got really good briefs from the scientists at DOE at Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs.
[02:12:22.220 --> 02:12:28.560]  And I was actually, to be completely honest, and I'm not just saying this like somebody's going to call me some deep state hack or something, and I'm not at all.
[02:12:28.659 --> 02:12:31.399]  I mean, I've got plenty of criticism of the government, trust me.
[02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:36.000]  If I was a deep state hack, I wouldn't be on this show.
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:37.319]  Yeah.
[02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:45.260]  I'd say that I was actually pretty impressed by the capabilities and the accountability that we have on things.
[02:12:45.380 --> 02:12:47.199]  We keep a really tight lock.
[02:12:47.359 --> 02:12:54.300]  But it's all very – there's a lot of things that you can see, but there's even more things that you can't see that are not obvious.
[02:12:54.560 --> 02:13:01.159]  So when we talk about these drones flying overhead, look, I don't have the answer to say exactly what it is.
[02:13:01.420 --> 02:13:18.689]  My best guess is it's a combination of – Right.
[02:13:24.649 --> 02:13:24.649]  Right.
[02:13:24.930 --> 02:13:25.029]  Right.
[02:13:27.710 --> 02:13:33.890]  And the thing is also, they would be followed by folks on the ground searching as well.
[02:13:34.050 --> 02:13:35.449]  And they can do that pretty discreetly.
[02:13:35.529 --> 02:13:36.229]  We learned to do that.
[02:13:36.670 --> 02:13:38.550]  You can actually do search for things.
[02:13:38.670 --> 02:13:44.369]  I mean, we had pretty cool, you know, manned portable radiation monitors that would just fit in a backpack.
[02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:48.949]  And I had a little, you know, a little display here, and we would just walk around.
[02:13:49.409 --> 02:13:53.039]  And if something popped up, It would start getting a ping.
[02:13:53.279 --> 02:13:55.100]  And then we trained this all the time.
[02:13:55.319 --> 02:14:05.600]  There was this really cool setup that they had training out at Sandia National Lab, which is at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, where they actually set up an entire mockup of a port facility.
[02:14:05.619 --> 02:14:10.359]  It's out in the desert, but with a giant port facility with giant containers, just like container ships coming in.
[02:14:10.770 --> 02:14:11.449]  Yeah.
[02:14:13.890 --> 02:14:14.149]  Yeah.
[02:14:47.450 --> 02:14:48.350]  Yeah, I understand.
[02:14:48.550 --> 02:14:51.050]  And so much of what you said is absolutely fascinating to me.
[02:14:51.210 --> 02:14:53.329]  I'm learning so much, and I've written down a couple of questions here.
[02:14:53.449 --> 02:14:55.590]  The first thing that I want to ask you is...
[02:14:57.199 --> 02:14:59.359]  I don't know anything about nuclear weaponry.
[02:14:59.500 --> 02:15:01.380]  I don't know anything about nuclear energy.
[02:15:02.039 --> 02:15:13.119]  My education on the matter basically can be reduced to the Chernobyl series on HBO. And so, given that the Soviet Union collapsed many decades ago...
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:16.039]  And maybe some of these weapons disappeared.
[02:15:16.239 --> 02:15:16.840]  Maybe they didn't.
[02:15:16.859 --> 02:15:20.279]  Maybe they were allocated to allies and it was just under wraps, whatever.
[02:15:21.020 --> 02:15:23.220]  What is the maintenance for something like this?
[02:15:23.300 --> 02:15:30.460]  Because when I look at leaving weapons behind in Afghanistan, for example, there's a lot of equipment that we left behind when Joe Biden pulled us out that...
[02:15:31.100 --> 02:15:35.920]  There's no infrastructure there for the locals or the natives to really maintain it properly.
[02:15:36.079 --> 02:15:37.600]  So what happens if that helicopter breaks down?
[02:15:37.739 --> 02:15:39.460]  Are you going to take it to the mechanic?
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:52.159]  So I imagine that there's some degree of maintenance, maybe not, please tell me, that's required to keep a nuclear warhead from Soviet-era Russia functional over the course of several decades.
[02:15:52.159 --> 02:15:52.739]  Is that true?
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:54.619]  That's absolutely correct.
[02:15:54.979 --> 02:15:57.659]  And even with our own weapons, you know, they have to go in.
[02:15:57.779 --> 02:15:58.920]  They have regularly scheduled maintenance.
[02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:04.979]  So my very first job in the military, coincidentally, before I was a Navy officer, I was actually an enlisted Marine.
[02:16:05.479 --> 02:16:08.060]  And I worked my first job in the Marine Corps.
[02:16:08.420 --> 02:16:09.840]  This was pre-9-11.
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:12.819]  So I was 18, 19 years old.
[02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:19.579]  As a 19, 20 years old, I worked at a submarine base up in Bangor, Washington.
[02:16:20.119 --> 02:16:25.739]  Right, which is where we keep all of our West Coast nuclear missile submarines, right?
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:28.340]  Like, think Crimson Tide, right?
[02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:29.699]  I mean, that was Bangor Space.
[02:16:29.979 --> 02:16:32.559]  I've actually been on board that boat, the USS Alabama.
[02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:37.979]  And so that is actually last, it's one of, if not, it's in, it's about an hour outside of Seattle.
[02:16:38.340 --> 02:16:45.000]  It's either the largest or one of the largest nuclear weapon storage facilities in the world.
[02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:54.440]  So whenever these, you know, every submarine that we have, our Ohio-class submarines, they have 24 missile tubes, right?
[02:16:54.780 --> 02:17:01.540]  And I think now the current, the D5 rockets, last I checked, each missile can carry anywhere from 8 to 12 warheads.
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:14.629]  And so then those submarines, whenever they come into port, they'd have to offload the missiles off the submarine and then truck them on a flatbed truck about a mile up, Yeah.
[02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:28.239]  Nothing like the border.
[02:17:28.399 --> 02:17:29.159]  No, no, no, no.
[02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:34.399]  No, I mean, like, if a raccoon went near the fence line, which they often did, we knew about it.
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:36.559]  I mean, it was extremely secure.
[02:17:36.959 --> 02:17:39.079]  It was, you know, even my mom thought it was scary.
[02:17:39.239 --> 02:17:41.040]  I said, Mom, it's the safest place in the world.
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:49.860]  Well, the reason I bring this up is because if sophisticated maintenance is required to keep these weapons operational, then that implies...
[02:17:51.899 --> 02:18:06.959]  We're good to go.
[02:18:08.170 --> 02:18:08.430]  Yeah.
[02:18:08.569 --> 02:18:11.270]  And also, yes, I concur.
[02:18:11.549 --> 02:18:16.350]  And then the other aspect of that is that people said, oh, well, it was a nuclear weapon.
[02:18:16.450 --> 02:18:17.770]  It was pulled out of Ukraine.
[02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:25.469]  Now, the thing is, is after the fall of the Soviet Union, one of the first things that the United States was concerned about was that there were tons of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.
[02:18:25.950 --> 02:18:29.709]  And when Ukraine was becoming an independent country, we had to make a deal.
[02:18:29.889 --> 02:18:39.239]  And this is back in, what, 1990, 1991. We made a deal with the Russians and the Ukrainians saying like, hey, Russia, you take your nukes out.
[02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:42.700]  Ukraine will protect you, so to speak, right?
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:43.620]  And it was like part of a deal.
[02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:51.200]  Ukraine was itself as a country was in no position then, they sure as hell aren't now, to possess nuclear weapons.
[02:18:51.280 --> 02:18:52.440]  That's a bad, we don't need that.
[02:18:52.899 --> 02:18:53.020]  Right.
[02:18:53.360 --> 02:19:01.440]  And so all the Russians took all those weapons out and brought them into Russia proper.
[02:19:01.909 --> 02:19:03.989]  So that was kind of part of a deal we made, right?
[02:19:04.629 --> 02:19:10.309]  And so we actually do have—I was actually surprised at the amount of accountability we actually do have.
[02:19:11.010 --> 02:19:14.670]  Just because we might not advertise that doesn't mean we don't have it.
[02:19:15.069 --> 02:19:24.450]  And additionally, yes, those warheads need—I mean, if it was just sitting in some bunker for the past 30 years collecting rust, right?
[02:19:24.450 --> 02:19:32.069]  And that was part of one of our jobs, was that, hey, maybe some terrorists did get a hold of something— And then we would have to run diagnostics on it.
[02:19:32.129 --> 02:19:35.270]  The idea is that, you know, we come in with all these Army Special Forces guys, right?
[02:19:35.409 --> 02:19:35.909]  Green Berets.
[02:19:36.370 --> 02:19:37.690]  They kill all the bad guys.
[02:19:37.829 --> 02:19:39.649]  This is like in the scenario how we play it, right?
[02:19:39.850 --> 02:19:41.129]  And we secure the weapons.
[02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:44.930]  And then my team and I, my EOD team, was four of us go to work.
[02:19:45.149 --> 02:19:54.549]  And our job was to, we had all sorts of really interesting tools and diagnostics where we could, one, determine, okay, is this thing real?
[02:19:54.729 --> 02:19:55.329]  Is it a hoax?
[02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:57.389]  If it is real, is it functional?
[02:19:57.940 --> 02:20:09.620]  And we were able to collect a lot of data and using communication methods that don't officially exist, we'd be able to transmit that to the smart guys at Los Alamos.
[02:20:10.159 --> 02:20:26.280]  And Los Alamos had this really cool Dr. Evil command center that I got to see, where we transmitted them, and they would look at everything, and they'd probably say something like, no, it's not real, it's a hoax device, or We practice.
[02:20:26.459 --> 02:20:27.040]  We train this.
[02:20:27.739 --> 02:20:34.100]  Overseas with partner nations, we conduct an exercise where we put a fake nuclear weapon, a mock-up.
[02:20:34.319 --> 02:20:36.399]  We play that whole game with role players.
[02:20:36.600 --> 02:20:39.319]  My team and I would go to work, and then I'm transmitting.
[02:20:39.479 --> 02:20:40.959]  I'm on my little Panasonic Toughbook.
[02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:50.639]  I'm setting up a little camera where I'm essentially on FaceTime or Skype, where I'm looking at the weapon or the item, as we'd say.
[02:20:51.219 --> 02:20:53.639]  We're taking x-rays and certain diagnostics.
[02:20:53.739 --> 02:20:54.540]  I'm uploading that.
[02:20:54.639 --> 02:20:55.840]  That goes to the smart people.
[02:20:56.079 --> 02:20:59.059]  And they'll look at it and say, okay, no, it's a hoax device.
[02:20:59.260 --> 02:21:04.379]  Or, yeah, it looks like they're trying to build something, but it won't pre-create a nuclear yield.
[02:21:04.379 --> 02:21:05.459]  It's still under construction.
[02:21:05.459 --> 02:21:08.520]  Or it's so damaged that, no, nothing's going to happen.
[02:21:08.979 --> 02:21:13.319]  Or they might say something like, oh, yeah, you guys are good.
[02:21:13.319 --> 02:21:14.059]  Just stay there.
[02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:15.120]  No, just keep working.
[02:21:15.239 --> 02:21:15.659]  You guys are fine.
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:18.719]  Well, that makes a lot of sense.
[02:21:18.940 --> 02:21:24.159]  So back to the drone thing specifically, probably not trying to detect a nuclear device.
[02:21:24.299 --> 02:21:25.819]  We've only got about two minutes until the break.
[02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:28.159]  I'm going to keep you for the next 30 minutes, too, after this break.
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:31.840]  I've done a little bit of government contracting.
[02:21:32.100 --> 02:21:34.860]  I worked for a company that was GSA certified at one point in time.
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:42.200]  It was a company called Energetics Technology Center, and they did research for weapon defense systems and things of that nature as an intern when I was in college.
[02:21:42.750 --> 02:21:54.610]  I know that there is tremendous amount of incentive for government contractors, government departments, agencies to exhaust the rest of their budget at the end of the year in order to justify getting the same budget the next year.
[02:21:55.069 --> 02:22:07.989]  Is it possible that Space Force or whatever government entities are operating these drones are trying to run up the bill intentionally before the end of the year so that they can get the same funding in the next round?
[02:22:08.809 --> 02:22:09.690]  I'll tell you this much.
[02:22:09.770 --> 02:22:12.010]  The government runs on a different calendar.
[02:22:12.729 --> 02:22:20.889]  The federal government, because I dealt with that exact same thing, but the government fiscal year ends in September, begins in October.
[02:22:22.389 --> 02:22:29.010]  When it came to funding, because I had to deal with that exact same thing, whether it was our unit, whether it was either money or the other thing was ammunition.
[02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:35.409]  If we had leftover ammunition, it was in September, we're like, hey, boys, let's go to the range.
[02:22:35.610 --> 02:22:37.129]  We would just shoot everything.
[02:22:38.889 --> 02:22:42.510]  They're handing us satchels a C4, like, go take it to the range and blow it up.
[02:22:43.329 --> 02:22:44.569]  Everything is really fun.
[02:22:44.950 --> 02:22:48.770]  But since the fiscal year ended in September, that's likely not the case with what's happening with these drones.
[02:22:48.889 --> 02:22:50.190]  And I don't mean to cut you off, Tom.
[02:22:50.389 --> 02:22:53.030]  It's just that we're coming up on a break in 30 seconds, and this is a good segue.
[02:22:53.309 --> 02:22:55.389]  I'm going to get more into this on the other side and speculation.
[02:22:55.389 --> 02:23:01.090]  In the meantime, folks, please follow Tom Sawyer on X at Thomas B. Sauer.
[02:23:01.250 --> 02:23:01.430]  Excuse me.
[02:23:01.489 --> 02:23:02.129]  I keep calling you Sawyer.
[02:23:02.709 --> 02:23:05.409]  Thomas B. S-A-U-E-R. Sauer.
[02:23:26.500 --> 02:23:31.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, because of your support in the last 30 years...
[02:23:31.700 --> 02:23:36.159]  My operation has successfully devastated the globalists.
[02:23:36.760 --> 02:23:48.479]  The enemies of freedom worldwide openly give us the credit for being the genesis point for the mass global awakening to the new world order that is happening right now.
[02:23:48.819 --> 02:23:54.989]  So ladies and gentlemen, as we go into Christmas 2024, And the globalists are fighting as hard as they can to shut us down.
[02:23:55.329 --> 02:24:02.690]  I want to thank you for your past support and I want to encourage you now to support the broadcast while getting great products because we're winning.

[02:24:06.530 --> 02:24:12.170]  I know my most important work and my crew's most important work is still to come.
[02:24:12.350 --> 02:24:14.409]  The people of the planet are waking up.
[02:24:14.569 --> 02:24:16.610]  Now they're really ready to hear the truth.
[02:24:16.930 --> 02:24:18.829]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:24:19.389 --> 02:24:34.229]  I want you all to have a fabulous Christmas coming up, and I want to encourage all of you to really think about what's happening around the world and ask yourselves, do we want to keep Alex Jones on the air, and do we want to get great products that enrich and empower our lives at the same time?

[02:24:59.350 --> 02:25:01.049]  Who fights, fights, fights.

[02:25:17.930 --> 02:25:21.549]  But now is the critical part of the fight and we need your support.
[02:25:21.729 --> 02:25:22.870]  Plus these are great products.
[02:25:23.069 --> 02:25:26.409]  Please go to TheAlexJonesStore.com and keep us on the air.
[02:25:54.210 --> 02:25:55.610]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Chase Geiser.
[02:25:55.639 --> 02:25:58.659]  During his career, Tom, it's an honor and a pleasure to be with you.
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.180]  I'm so grateful for your expertise and your insight.
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:02.979]  I've learned so much in this broadcast already.
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:10.700]  And the main reason I wanted to have you on is because you are a credible source saying that these drones are not looking for dirty bombs.
[02:26:10.860 --> 02:26:13.920]  They're probably not detecting radiation, even if they do have the capability to do that.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.739]  There's other ways to do that that are more sophisticated.
[02:26:16.059 --> 02:26:20.940]  We have proactive infrastructure in place that would likely prevent something like that from even getting here in the first place.
[02:26:45.869 --> 02:26:45.989]  I agree with you.
[02:26:46.049 --> 02:26:53.290]  And so I think that hindsight's going to be 20-20 on this, but very alarming and bizarre the way that our government has talked about this.
[02:26:53.489 --> 02:26:58.389]  I want to bring up one thing before I get some more of your thoughts on what's going on with this drone stuff.
[02:26:58.590 --> 02:27:00.389]  You mentioned that you were stationed in Japan.
[02:27:00.610 --> 02:27:05.110]  You were involved in neutralizing explosive threats.
[02:27:05.370 --> 02:27:18.350]  I have a close friend who was a cyber intelligence officer, and his background is in audio engineering and Yeah.
[02:27:32.739 --> 02:27:37.399]  And I know that whenever you attack the United States, it awakens a sleeping giant, and we could probably bounce back quickly.
[02:27:37.540 --> 02:27:54.200]  But were you involved in any work that was not just the neutralization of terrorist threats and terrorist weapons of mass destruction, but were you involved in any capacity to our defense efforts, our proactive defense efforts as they pertain to China as a threat?
[02:27:54.780 --> 02:27:55.760]  Very much so.
[02:27:55.899 --> 02:28:00.889]  So after I finished that tour with Charlie 1-1, which is that unit.
[02:28:01.069 --> 02:28:04.510]  Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group out of Okinawa.
[02:28:05.090 --> 02:28:06.250]  I did a staff job.
[02:28:06.510 --> 02:28:08.850]  And I was based in Coronado.
[02:28:09.090 --> 02:28:09.870]  Lovely Coronado.
[02:28:10.110 --> 02:28:11.690]  And I spent a lot of time doing...
[02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:32.239]  We have a plan for just about anything, right?
[02:28:32.399 --> 02:28:33.899]  Of any major war.
[02:28:34.020 --> 02:28:38.959]  And that is actually how the US military is organized and funded.
[02:28:39.399 --> 02:28:43.639]  So we've got an O plan for war with North Korea.
[02:28:43.719 --> 02:28:48.579]  We have an O plan for war with China, especially like a Taiwan scenario.
[02:28:49.540 --> 02:28:59.540]  Can't go into too much detail about that, but I was involved in the drafting and the writing of the latest, well, at the time, 10 years ago, which was the latest iteration.
[02:28:59.739 --> 02:29:00.280]  Would we win?
[02:29:02.739 --> 02:29:05.879]  Yes, we would, because we always win in the scenario on paper.
[02:29:06.079 --> 02:29:07.299]  We only win world wars.
[02:29:08.329 --> 02:29:08.729]  Right.
[02:29:08.969 --> 02:29:10.930]  And so I was involved.
[02:29:11.069 --> 02:29:15.309]  It was really interesting because the Korea plan I spent a lot of time on, which was the North Korea plan.
[02:29:15.530 --> 02:29:26.309]  But the whole idea behind it is that you get all the generals and the admirals together and all their staff and they say, OK, based on what we know about the enemy and their capabilities, they can do this.
[02:29:26.569 --> 02:29:27.930]  What do how would we do it?
[02:29:28.219 --> 02:29:33.120]  And that those plans would drive what we call requirements, right?
[02:29:33.219 --> 02:29:39.639]  Requirements is, hey, we need X number of tanks, battalions, ships, jets, missiles, bombs.
[02:29:39.780 --> 02:29:44.819]  We need a capability to do this and then how many we need.
[02:29:44.940 --> 02:29:48.239]  And that is what drives funding for the military, right?
[02:29:48.399 --> 02:29:50.020]  I mean, that's kind of how it flows, right?
[02:29:50.219 --> 02:29:53.920]  You've got the plans, the war plans, that drive the requirements.
[02:29:54.340 --> 02:29:56.180]  And that requirement drives funding.
[02:29:56.559 --> 02:30:04.600]  So that's kind of how the DOD is funded in many ways because the military puts out requirements saying, hey, we need a jet that can fly this high, this fast.
[02:30:04.719 --> 02:30:07.059]  We need missiles that can do this and this and this, right?
[02:30:07.200 --> 02:30:08.639]  And then those go out to the contractors.
[02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:10.000]  They bill it.
[02:30:10.299 --> 02:30:14.459]  I mean, and obviously it's an incredibly complex, convoluted process.
[02:30:14.920 --> 02:30:18.559]  But, I mean, to break it down Barney style, that's kind of what happens, right?
[02:30:18.879 --> 02:30:21.260]  So I was involved in those plans and with China.
[02:30:21.479 --> 02:30:35.329]  So one of the things that's, you know, What I'm happy to talk about is that the Chinese Navy has the largest and most sophisticated inventory of naval mines in the world.
[02:30:36.430 --> 02:30:51.379]  And also, fun pointing out and speaking as a naval officer is that More ships, more U.S. Navy ships have been damaged or destroyed since the end of World War II from naval mines than they have from missiles, torpedoes.
[02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:55.239]  Were those mines planted during World War II or are they newly planted mines?
[02:30:56.049 --> 02:30:56.729]  They're not laid.
[02:30:56.829 --> 02:31:01.790]  The plans are not – no, the mines have not been laid, but they have a mine-laying capability, right?
[02:31:02.049 --> 02:31:06.930]  And so what they're really – and especially the really sophisticated ones are meant to be deepwater mines.
[02:31:07.329 --> 02:31:13.389]  And a lot of them are actually the Chinese, the really advanced Chinese ones, which are mostly knockoffs of Russian ones.
[02:31:13.469 --> 02:31:14.709]  The Russians were very good at this.
[02:31:15.090 --> 02:31:17.010]  It is meant to kill our submarines.
[02:31:18.129 --> 02:31:19.530]  That's what they're really going to go after.
[02:31:19.809 --> 02:31:24.370]  So then that is primarily what we would try to go against.
[02:31:24.549 --> 02:31:34.049]  But then there would also be opportunities where they could go after American landing craft, like in a Korea scenario, stuff like that.
[02:31:34.229 --> 02:31:34.889]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:31:34.989 --> 02:31:38.370]  If an ocean bed mine...
[02:31:39.079 --> 02:31:40.260]  Hits one of our submarines.
[02:31:40.299 --> 02:31:43.940]  Let's just say that it happens now and everybody on board dies.
[02:31:44.159 --> 02:31:45.459]  Does the public ever hear that story?
[02:31:46.459 --> 02:31:47.219]  Yeah, they will.
[02:31:47.420 --> 02:31:48.000]  They would.
[02:31:48.159 --> 02:31:49.500]  Yeah, and that would be a tremendous act of war.
[02:31:49.579 --> 02:31:57.620]  And here's one thing as well is that I remember publicly the former US PACOM commanders, now Indo PACOM, which was the four star admiral.
[02:31:57.739 --> 02:31:59.799]  His name was Admiral Locklear at the time.
[02:32:00.810 --> 02:32:09.170]  He was, you know, he had, and the Indo-PACOM commander essentially has what General MacArthur's old job was, right?
[02:32:09.469 --> 02:32:16.229]  He's in charge of every military asset, as we would say, from Hollywood to Bollywood, right?
[02:32:16.389 --> 02:32:18.229]  That entire swath of the world.
[02:32:18.430 --> 02:32:27.649]  So, and he said very publicly, I am not going to send a US national asset into a minefield.
[02:32:28.189 --> 02:32:28.549]  Right?
[02:32:28.850 --> 02:32:30.610]  Because we're not going to risk it.
[02:32:30.690 --> 02:32:33.729]  We're not going to risk one of our submarines going into a minefield.
[02:32:34.229 --> 02:32:35.049]  Not going to do it.
[02:32:35.610 --> 02:32:42.690]  So what it comes down to is one of the phrases we talk about is A2AD, all these silly military acronyms and jargon.
[02:32:43.329 --> 02:32:44.370]  It's called, what is it?
[02:32:48.700 --> 02:32:58.100]  It's basically meant what the mines really do is they're really there to deny us access to get to a certain part of water, right?
[02:32:58.219 --> 02:33:00.360]  Because we know, okay, this area might be mined.
[02:33:00.819 --> 02:33:08.540]  It's going to take forever and a day to clear those mines because our mine clearing capability is not up to snuff.
[02:33:08.680 --> 02:33:09.700]  Not enough dolphins in the world.
[02:33:11.459 --> 02:33:11.760]  Right.
[02:33:11.879 --> 02:33:13.100]  We actually got rid of that program.
[02:33:13.319 --> 02:33:25.260]  It was the only thing, by the way, in Korea, one of the things we planned for, the Korea scenario, is that the water around Korea is actually incredibly shallow and murky, silty.
[02:33:25.520 --> 02:33:33.209]  So if the North Koreans were to lay mines, like to protect a beachhead, They would sink, and they'd self-bury in a matter of days.
[02:33:33.870 --> 02:33:46.090]  And the only proven capability that we actually have to find a buried mine that's sunk, that's been buried after time, it just sinks after a few days, is a dolphin.
[02:33:46.549 --> 02:33:49.889]  And we got rid of that program, the MMS, the Marine Mammal System.
[02:33:49.950 --> 02:33:51.229]  I think it was the Mark 7?
[02:33:51.450 --> 02:33:52.489]  I can't remember.
[02:33:52.629 --> 02:33:54.049]  But the Marine Mammal System, right?
[02:33:54.190 --> 02:33:58.729]  And we have some other technological capabilities, but it would be very, very slow.
[02:33:59.139 --> 02:34:09.739]  And so, and also, so my little brother is currently an active duty U.S. Navy EOD officer, also stationed in Japan, and he is on a staff these days.
[02:34:09.739 --> 02:34:11.260]  He's pretty senior nowadays.
[02:34:11.260 --> 02:34:13.760]  He's actually been in longer than I have, than I was.
[02:34:15.030 --> 02:34:25.190]  And one of his units' job is to try to figure out, hey, if we had to clear mines in Korea or have to clear mines around Taiwan, how would we do that?
[02:34:25.290 --> 02:34:31.709]  And I can say this publicly, is our capabilities are not as strong as we would like them to be.
[02:34:31.870 --> 02:34:32.170]  Sure.
[02:34:32.450 --> 02:34:34.809]  And that is where you get the real frustration.
[02:34:35.069 --> 02:34:47.159]  I'll tie this into a lot of issues you hear about military and the things that Secretary of Defense Select Pete Hegseth talks about, is that You know, he talks a lot about the woke stuff and the DEI stuff, right?
[02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:48.860]  And so I talk to my brother about this all the time.
[02:34:48.959 --> 02:34:50.239]  He's one of my closest friends as well.
[02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:55.139]  And he'll agree that all that DEI and the woke crap, it's stupid, right?
[02:34:55.260 --> 02:34:58.340]  It's really stupid, but that's not the real problem.
[02:34:58.739 --> 02:35:04.920]  Like, the real problems that we have in the military is poor use of resources, right?
[02:35:05.100 --> 02:35:07.319]  I mean, there's tons of money going around, trust me.
[02:35:07.340 --> 02:35:09.319]  Almost like you need a Department of Government efficiency.
[02:35:10.979 --> 02:35:11.340]  Right.
[02:35:11.639 --> 02:35:11.840]  Maybe.
[02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:12.639]  Maybe.
[02:35:12.979 --> 02:35:13.219]  Right.
[02:35:13.799 --> 02:35:15.579]  And to actual, for the actual capability.
[02:35:15.739 --> 02:35:25.600]  So, you know, we've got ships right now where maintenance is falling behind, where equipment breaks, and there's only like two or three guys in the world that know how to fix it, because it's really niche and sophisticated.
[02:35:25.860 --> 02:35:28.700]  It's going to take them weeks, months to get out there to fix it.
[02:35:28.780 --> 02:35:29.500]  Oh, we need another part.
[02:35:29.620 --> 02:35:31.700]  And then all of a sudden, it just costs money and money and money.
[02:35:32.540 --> 02:35:35.479]  So we're not prepared for a major conflict in the Pacific?
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:36.040]  No.
[02:35:38.540 --> 02:35:45.459]  I would say this, and this is one thing I think that most of my friends would agree, is it would get really ugly in the beginning.
[02:35:45.659 --> 02:35:49.079]  Yeah, just like World War II. It was ugly in the beginning, too, and we ramped up.
[02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:57.379]  So, based on your experience and your work with government and with these agencies and departments...
[02:35:58.870 --> 02:36:00.530]  And explosives and all these things.
[02:36:00.750 --> 02:36:11.329]  If you had to guess, and I'm disclaiming this as speculative, if you had to guess what's going on with these drones being seen in the tri-state area specifically, what do you think?
[02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:20.049]  I think it probably could be a combination of hobbyists who are having fun scaring people.
[02:36:20.290 --> 02:36:37.680]  I think it could be a combination and also a lack of I think a little bit of hysteria can set in.
[02:36:37.799 --> 02:36:38.420]  Maybe there are.
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:40.379]  There are some drones running around.
[02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:42.239]  Nobody really knows what they are.
[02:36:42.340 --> 02:36:43.420]  Can't really identify them.
[02:36:43.860 --> 02:36:48.600]  But then also people start looking at them and anything they see in the sky is now some mystery drone.
[02:36:49.139 --> 02:36:49.579]  Right, right.
[02:36:49.719 --> 02:36:50.840]  Everybody's been looking at their phones.
[02:36:50.940 --> 02:36:55.639]  But now that all the headlines are about these, these drones are looking up at the same time and capturing anything they see.
[02:36:56.200 --> 02:36:59.520]  It might just be a Cessna up there or a helicopter or something.
[02:37:00.239 --> 02:37:04.639]  And so I think it really comes down to just a lack of detection capability.
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:06.340]  We don't really know what it is.
[02:37:06.459 --> 02:37:08.180]  And one hand is never talking to the other.
[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:10.680]  Many such cases in the government.
[02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:11.739]  Right, right.
[02:37:12.450 --> 02:37:20.750]  Yeah, so I usually don't go to the dangerous conspiracy first.
[02:37:20.750 --> 02:37:22.909]  That's usually not where I first jump.
[02:37:24.790 --> 02:37:30.649]  Never attribute to malice, which you could very easily attribute to ignorance or incompetence.
[02:37:30.770 --> 02:37:30.969]  Right.
[02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.370]  Right?
[02:37:31.430 --> 02:37:32.370]  That's usually the case.
[02:37:32.780 --> 02:37:36.879]  Well, there's certainly a lot of consumers that are flying their drones in response to these sightings.
[02:37:37.020 --> 02:37:41.600]  So I'm sure that that ratio has shifted and balanced out since the onset.
[02:37:41.799 --> 02:37:45.860]  But it seems like initially something sophisticated and official is going on.
[02:37:45.940 --> 02:37:50.479]  And then briefly, they tried to make it sound like it was an Iranian mothership of drones.
[02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:51.620]  I think that was kind of debunked.
[02:37:51.639 --> 02:37:53.319]  It was bizarre that they even said that for a day.
[02:37:53.700 --> 02:37:56.879]  But I don't know what's going on with this.
[02:37:56.940 --> 02:37:57.879]  It seems bizarre to me.
[02:37:58.500 --> 02:37:59.579]  It seems like it could have been.
[02:38:01.630 --> 02:38:13.170]  A war of the worlds-esque attempt where they were trying to alarm people in order to justify legislation for increased drone control because maybe they don't want Chinese drones flown here legally because of all the data that goes back to China.
[02:38:13.329 --> 02:38:13.829]  I don't know.
[02:38:14.149 --> 02:38:16.469]  But I think that hindsight will prove 2020 on this.
[02:38:16.569 --> 02:38:21.309]  Now, we've got about 10 minutes left, and in the last five minutes or so, I want to give you a chance to talk about the work that you're doing.
[02:38:21.389 --> 02:38:24.350]  But before that, I would be remiss not to ask you about this.
[02:38:24.469 --> 02:38:28.790]  I've been looking into and trying to pay attention to what's been going on with Africa.
[02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:41.159]  I found it bizarre that For a period of time, Blinken was having all these meetings with African leaders coming out and talking about humanitarian rights and gay rights in African countries.
[02:38:41.159 --> 02:38:45.860]  It seems very unrelated to what's going on.
[02:38:45.979 --> 02:38:52.219]  So whenever I see something like that, I think, all right, why is it that Blinken is making excuses to get involved with Africa?
[02:38:52.360 --> 02:39:00.420]  Now, we've seen this conflict with Israel and We've seen this conflict with Ukraine and Russia escalate.
[02:39:00.620 --> 02:39:02.440]  A lot of people are tying it back to Iran.
[02:39:02.620 --> 02:39:08.100]  Iran has for a long time been accused of being the source of terrorism basically throughout the Middle East.
[02:39:08.799 --> 02:39:18.100]  My question for you is, what's happening with uranium in Africa being exported to Iran?
[02:39:22.450 --> 02:39:26.110]  I mean, I think it sounds kind of obvious, right?
[02:39:26.350 --> 02:39:34.969]  I mean, look, the Iranians obviously want to have not just nuclear weapons, but nuclear delivery capability.
[02:39:35.149 --> 02:39:37.250]  You don't think that they already have nukes?
[02:39:37.389 --> 02:39:38.670]  And maybe you know and you can't tell me.
[02:39:40.770 --> 02:39:44.049]  I find it hard to believe that Israel and Iran don't have nuclear weapons.
[02:39:45.619 --> 02:39:48.739]  I'm quite confident that the Israelis do, obviously, right?
[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:54.100]  And I think they've got some – and also it's really interesting, though, it's not just having a warhead.
[02:39:54.340 --> 02:39:58.899]  It's having it small enough and having the delivery capability, right?
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:02.379]  And so, yeah, I think they are trying to get more uranium.
[02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:05.379]  Here's something that I read in a story.
[02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:06.440]  Maybe you could find it.
[02:40:06.700 --> 02:40:16.870]  I read that I thought was really interesting was that one of the things that certain intelligence – Units, I guess, in the military have done.
[02:40:16.870 --> 02:40:19.610]  I read this, and I thought it was interesting.
[02:40:20.149 --> 02:40:20.750]  Maybe we're looking at it.
[02:40:21.010 --> 02:40:26.049]  We would do things like sell through a third party, right?
[02:40:26.350 --> 02:40:31.309]  We would end up selling phony material to our enemies, right?
[02:40:31.489 --> 02:40:42.690]  So, for example, we were able to slow down at least the North Korean nuclear program by swapping out cobalt and That the North Koreans need to use.
[02:40:42.790 --> 02:40:55.770]  So in order to create a pit, right, you need to have – it needs to be melted down into a crucible, and that crucible needs to be involved like some – I can't remember the exact specific type of cobalt, if I remember correctly.
[02:40:55.770 --> 02:41:03.809]  It's heat-resistant that will not interfere with uranium, and we would sell them adulterated cobalt.
[02:41:04.020 --> 02:41:11.520]  They thought they were getting a good product from some nefarious dealer, and we made sure that they got something that didn't work.
[02:41:11.659 --> 02:41:19.639]  So then, when they put it into the crucibles to create the pits, the crucibles broke, and you had molten uranium go all over the place.
[02:41:19.639 --> 02:41:23.280]  But you can follow that supply chain then and know what they're actually trying to do.
[02:41:24.250 --> 02:41:24.569]  Right.
[02:41:24.729 --> 02:41:26.229]  And so I think that's part of that supply chain.
[02:41:26.309 --> 02:41:27.149]  So that's one of the things that we do.
[02:41:27.229 --> 02:41:28.350]  We interfere with it all the time.
[02:41:29.090 --> 02:41:44.709]  During the troubles, the British would use this with the IRA, would, you know, through, you know, surreptitious swap out, they'd, you know, sell loud explosives or certain devices that either wouldn't detonate or they'd make sure that the bomb would detonate on the bomb maker when he's putting it together,
[02:41:45.110 --> 02:41:45.709]  stuff like that.
[02:41:45.889 --> 02:41:58.229]  So, I do know that we are taking active steps there because in Africa – and all you got to keep in mind is another power that is asserting themselves – well, two powers that are asserting themselves in Africa is China, obviously.
[02:41:58.229 --> 02:41:59.530]  You've probably heard plenty of that.
[02:41:59.670 --> 02:42:00.729]  And also Russia.
[02:42:00.850 --> 02:42:05.790]  They're trying to assert themselves and create problems for us in other parts of the country, right?
[02:42:05.790 --> 02:42:11.389]  Because – Yeah.
[02:42:12.010 --> 02:42:13.030]  Yeah.
[02:42:13.450 --> 02:42:13.569]  Yeah.
[02:42:23.220 --> 02:42:24.020]  It's not good.
[02:42:24.040 --> 02:42:24.760]  Let me ask you this.
[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:26.959]  You've been in this space for a long time.
[02:42:27.239 --> 02:42:28.180]  Obviously, I trust you.
[02:42:28.459 --> 02:42:30.159]  You're an honest, earnest guy.
[02:42:31.020 --> 02:42:37.139]  Though I'm opposed to the deep state, I understand that in any of these organizations or institutions, there are white hats and there are black hats.
[02:42:37.319 --> 02:42:39.260]  That's just the way it is in any business, private, whatever.
[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:49.120]  It just seems like this administration specifically really wants to escalate the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.
[02:42:50.540 --> 02:43:01.159]  What is your perspective as somewhat of an insider in the space on whether or not our military industrial complex actually wants all-out war with Russia or China?
[02:43:03.129 --> 02:43:03.989]  That's a great question.
[02:43:04.290 --> 02:43:19.389]  I would say right now that you can probably tell the Biden administration is doing everything they can for these next, what, 34 days or so to hand, you know, when the new Trump admin takes over, to hand us a, you know,
[02:43:19.430 --> 02:43:22.809]  hand the Trump admin a giant steaming pile of garbage.
[02:43:22.969 --> 02:43:23.170]  Yes.
[02:43:23.350 --> 02:43:23.530]  Right?
[02:43:23.709 --> 02:43:26.809]  And to set them up for failure as much as they possibly can.
[02:43:27.450 --> 02:43:28.850]  And then that's what's gonna happen.
[02:43:28.969 --> 02:43:30.690]  I mean, you know, even when...
[02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:38.420]  When George Bush took over in the Clinton White House, the staff would remove all the W keys from the keyboard.
[02:43:38.520 --> 02:43:39.200]  They thought it was funny.
[02:43:39.540 --> 02:43:46.139]  That's about as bad as it got these days to try to burn the world down in order to set up the Trump admin for failure.
[02:43:48.319 --> 02:43:50.260]  Yeah, I think.
[02:44:10.629 --> 02:44:11.649]  They're trying to walk the line.
[02:44:11.729 --> 02:44:12.889]  I think that's what they're really trying to do.
[02:44:13.110 --> 02:44:16.590]  And also keep in mind, the military industrial complex does not thrive under peace.
[02:44:16.770 --> 02:44:17.170]  Right.
[02:44:17.409 --> 02:44:17.569]  Right?
[02:44:17.889 --> 02:44:19.190]  I mean, six months, was it?
[02:44:19.389 --> 02:44:24.190]  Six months after we got out of Afghanistan horribly, right?
[02:44:24.649 --> 02:44:28.049]  Six months later, hey, a new market opened up in Ukraine.
[02:44:28.489 --> 02:44:28.489]  Right.
[02:44:32.659 --> 02:44:37.079]  Remember, the military-industrial complex, and I don't think it's necessarily some giant conspiracy.
[02:44:37.079 --> 02:44:39.719]  I think it's just people are incentives-driven, right?
[02:44:39.780 --> 02:44:41.500]  They're incentivized for there to be conflict.
[02:44:41.659 --> 02:44:47.620]  It's the national way in which a large industry operates without any one person actually calling the shots.
[02:44:47.620 --> 02:44:49.639]  It's just going to play out that way.
[02:44:49.739 --> 02:44:51.659]  So we've got about four or five minutes left.
[02:44:52.239 --> 02:45:00.000]  Tom, and I want to give you the opportunity to tell the audience a little bit about what you're working on now, what you're doing, and direct them to where they can support you, follow you.
[02:45:00.440 --> 02:45:01.180]  I appreciate that.
[02:45:01.299 --> 02:45:06.000]  So when I got out of the Navy, I started along with one of my Naval Academy classmates.
[02:45:06.260 --> 02:45:11.319]  So to go back a little bit, my father died of a drug overdose right before I left for the military.
[02:45:11.559 --> 02:45:14.239]  And so that always really impacted me quite a bit.
[02:45:15.649 --> 02:45:20.209]  And then when I got out, I started a company along with my classmate.
[02:45:21.309 --> 02:45:25.389]  We provide very intensive mental health and addiction treatment for veterans.
[02:45:26.170 --> 02:45:29.170]  And so we are a contractor with the Department of Veterans Affairs.
[02:45:29.870 --> 02:45:34.010]  And I know that everyone loves to crap on VA all the time.
[02:45:34.010 --> 02:45:35.010]  And I get it, right?
[02:45:35.149 --> 02:45:37.090]  I mean, I've had my frustrations with them as well.
[02:45:37.149 --> 02:45:41.290]  And most certainly the veterans that we take care of have a lot of frustrations with them.
[02:45:41.739 --> 02:45:49.879]  But I'll say that by and large, the people that we work with, like the boots on the ground folks, the nurses, the therapists, the social workers are amazing people.
[02:45:50.659 --> 02:45:57.379]  And they've really had their hands tied in the past couple of years, especially the past six or eight months.
[02:45:58.600 --> 02:46:03.059]  Because, again, the Biden administration is trying to make things as difficult as possible.
[02:46:03.319 --> 02:46:07.139]  So they are not following what's called the VA Mission Act, right?
[02:46:07.399 --> 02:46:16.569]  And so the VA Mission Act is what allows veterans who want to receive care, either mental health care or addiction treatment, And they're in really bad shape.
[02:46:16.709 --> 02:46:21.629]  This isn't like the guys that we're talking about are not, hey, I think I drink too much and I'm arguing with my wife.
[02:46:21.850 --> 02:46:28.370]  These are guys that are near death or they're gonna go back to prison or they've had a suicide attempt or contemplating suicide.
[02:46:30.409 --> 02:46:32.569]  And so we provide a lot of that treatment for them.
[02:46:32.670 --> 02:46:38.489]  And so that's why I gotta say when Trump won 2020 or the 2024 election, we were doing cartwheels.
[02:46:38.629 --> 02:46:45.120]  We were absolutely Yeah, and that right there, that's my testimony before the House Veterans Affairs Committee last year.
[02:46:46.020 --> 02:46:47.719]  And so we talked a lot about that.
[02:46:47.860 --> 02:46:48.620]  Wow, you guys are good.
[02:46:50.809 --> 02:47:06.250]  So we are overjoyed, not only that the Trump administration is back in power, but also that we've got Doug Collins, who's gonna be the next Secretary of VA. And I've been dialed into a lot of the conservative movement in Trump world, mostly through, at my old unit,
[02:47:06.350 --> 02:47:12.909]  there was a junior intelligence analyst named Jack Posobiec, who was not very, that's how I got dialed in on it.
[02:47:12.909 --> 02:47:14.149]  Did he say happy birthday to him the other day?
[02:47:14.889 --> 02:47:15.469]  I did.
[02:47:15.709 --> 02:47:16.350]  Yeah, I did.
[02:47:16.389 --> 02:47:17.010]  And he made fun of me.
[02:47:17.090 --> 02:47:17.690]  We joked about it.
[02:47:17.770 --> 02:47:18.629]  Yeah, it was good.
[02:47:18.770 --> 02:47:25.809]  So right after Alex keeled over at the podium at the Young Republican Club dinner, he just texted me back about it.
[02:47:26.979 --> 02:47:29.239]  But anyways, that's how I got dialed in all this.
[02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:37.940]  So this week, I'm actually going back to Mar-a-Lago and to meet with some important people, names you'd probably definitely recognize.
[02:47:38.180 --> 02:47:52.459]  And we're really pushing hard to make sure that not only Doug Collins, the next VA Secretary, really understands the problem, but we're also pushing hard to have one of the candidates who is up to be the Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs named Darren Selnick.
[02:47:52.649 --> 02:47:56.729]  And he is a senior advisor at Concerned Veterans for America.
[02:47:56.729 --> 02:48:00.510]  He worked really closely with Pete Hegseth when Pete was the executive director.
[02:48:01.170 --> 02:48:04.930]  And he is absolutely the right choice to be the deputy secretary.
[02:48:04.930 --> 02:48:15.989]  So he knows where the bodies are buried at VA. We're good to go.
[02:48:27.850 --> 02:48:28.149]  Yeah.
[02:48:28.229 --> 02:48:30.229]  You know, it's just like the military, right?
[02:48:30.430 --> 02:48:32.149]  Just like the FBI. You've got ranking.
[02:48:32.309 --> 02:48:34.510]  I got a couple of friends who are in the FBI, right?
[02:48:35.170 --> 02:48:37.750]  And they hate what the hell has been going on there.
[02:48:37.930 --> 02:48:40.969]  They're overjoyed that Kash Patel might be the next director, right?
[02:48:41.110 --> 02:48:43.170]  But usually one of those problems are really up near the top.
[02:48:43.450 --> 02:48:51.030]  So the fact that we're having a new regime come in to the VA with Doug Collins and honestly with Darren Selenick by his side, that'll be absolutely huge.
[02:48:51.110 --> 02:48:53.750]  So I look forward to talking to some key people.
[02:49:00.630 --> 02:49:06.670]  Well, Tom Sauer, it's been an honor and a pleasure to have you on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:49:06.770 --> 02:49:19.469]  Thank you so much for being so generous with your time and sharing your knowledge and expertise on these critical developments and matters that are unfolding before this crucial inauguration takes place on January 20th.
[02:49:19.860 --> 02:49:20.579]  Folks, be there.
[02:49:21.020 --> 02:49:21.860]  Make sure you stay tuned.
[02:49:22.079 --> 02:49:23.819]  We have callers for the next hour.
[02:49:23.879 --> 02:49:24.559]  I'm going to be taking calls.
[02:49:24.639 --> 02:49:26.879]  Call in 877-789-2539.
[02:49:27.219 --> 02:49:29.579]  That's 877-789-2539.
[02:49:29.899 --> 02:49:33.319]  Finally, 877-789-2539.
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:34.319]  Call in.
[02:49:34.420 --> 02:49:35.079]  Open lines.
[02:49:35.260 --> 02:49:37.200]  I'll be here until Alan Troyer takes over.
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:39.040]  The War Room at 3 p.m.
[02:49:39.389 --> 02:49:44.850]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting to stop World War III. We are battling to get Trump into office.
[02:49:44.930 --> 02:49:46.290]  He's only president-elect right now.
[02:49:46.469 --> 02:49:48.170]  We are exposing the globalists.
[02:49:48.250 --> 02:49:51.209]  We are reaching 60, 70, 80 million people a day.
[02:49:51.370 --> 02:49:53.129]  We're back in the Infowars studios.
[02:49:53.489 --> 02:49:55.450]  The purchase was fraudulent.
[02:49:55.819 --> 02:49:57.940]  There's emergency hearings in court coming up next week.
[02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:03.780]  But regardless, I'm gonna stay on air at the Alex Jones Network even if this shuts down.
[02:50:03.959 --> 02:50:09.239]  So when you go to our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, that's not owned by me.
[02:50:09.479 --> 02:50:17.920]  The Onion people and the National Gun Control Crew and the Democrats, even if they succeed, which I don't believe they will, will not get thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:21.299]  They will not get the Alex Jones Network because I don't own it.
[02:50:21.780 --> 02:50:26.899]  So when you support our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com with some of the most incredible supplements ever.
[02:50:27.100 --> 02:50:29.520]  The Superfood, Irish Sea Moss.
[02:50:29.719 --> 02:50:32.959]  We have the strongest, most concentrated, incredible for your whole body.
[02:50:33.100 --> 02:50:34.459]  Take an hour to go through it all.
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:35.440]  Go check it out.
[02:50:35.739 --> 02:50:42.360]  That's there discounted up to 55% when you get three bottles, 50% when you get one bottle, 40% when you get one bottle.
[02:50:42.520 --> 02:50:43.079]  Try it.
[02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:43.739]  You're going to love it.
[02:50:43.799 --> 02:50:44.260]  I'm on it.
[02:50:44.340 --> 02:50:45.139]  I've lost so much weight.
[02:50:45.379 --> 02:50:46.079]  It's insane.
[02:50:46.219 --> 02:50:47.879]  Get that and other supplements and then...
[02:50:48.219 --> 02:50:51.899]  There's over 200 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies down there.
[02:50:52.059 --> 02:50:58.420]  These folks that own it bigly were already one of the top producers of Trump and Patriot gear.
[02:50:58.540 --> 02:50:59.360]  They had the best designs.
[02:50:59.739 --> 02:51:01.500]  All of the new Trump One gear.
[02:51:01.600 --> 02:51:03.979]  There's more than 40 shirts and hoodies and ball caps there.
[02:51:04.319 --> 02:51:05.639]  These designs are incredible.
[02:51:05.799 --> 02:51:12.040]  And now there's all these amazing Alex Jones shirts that are limited edition and will keep me on the air one way or another.
[02:51:12.260 --> 02:51:12.799]  Here they are.
[02:51:12.959 --> 02:51:13.739]  Look at this one.
[02:51:13.899 --> 02:51:17.819]  That famous meme of me coming out of the tunnel with all the Alex Jones clones.
[02:51:18.059 --> 02:51:19.819]  We are all Alex Jones.
[02:51:19.979 --> 02:51:21.000]  You've got to get that.
[02:51:21.579 --> 02:51:23.319]  Gay frogs equals extinction.
[02:51:23.600 --> 02:51:24.260]  Oh my goodness.
[02:51:24.680 --> 02:51:27.879]  What a way to wake folks up about all the poison in the water that's now mainstream news.
[02:51:28.420 --> 02:51:31.280]  1984 is not an instruction manual.
[02:51:31.700 --> 02:51:32.899]  Team Humanity.
[02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:34.579]  Oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[02:51:34.719 --> 02:51:36.920]  Launched that over a year ago with Elon Musk.
[02:51:37.079 --> 02:51:38.840]  And then, Dale Grebel.
[02:51:39.280 --> 02:51:44.479]  Oh, warns you about the government was right the whole time.
[02:51:44.879 --> 02:51:45.799]  Darkest Hour.
[02:51:46.059 --> 02:51:47.280]  Me is Winston Churchill.
[02:51:47.520 --> 02:51:52.319]  And so much more at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:51:52.319 --> 02:51:54.579]  Now, we don't make a ton off the t-shirts.
[02:51:55.090 --> 02:51:59.909]  We don't make a ton off the supplements because there's not a lot of markup in those, but we do sell a lot.
[02:52:00.049 --> 02:52:12.530]  But where we do get major funds is the marked up classic Alex Jones Infowars red on navy blue shirt and a few other fundraiser shirts that aren't 25 or 30 bucks, they're 50, so we get real money in.
[02:52:12.590 --> 02:52:16.329]  Because these t-shirts are high quality, printed right here in Arkansas in the United States.
[02:52:16.879 --> 02:52:20.239]  And so, extra, extra, extra large is like 16, 17 bucks.
[02:52:20.379 --> 02:52:22.680]  A small is like 15. The printing costs money.
[02:52:22.819 --> 02:52:24.100]  The sponsor gets part of the money.
[02:52:24.200 --> 02:52:25.440]  We get part of it to operate.
[02:52:26.100 --> 02:52:28.620]  We're making like six, seven bucks on the average t-shirt, which is great.
[02:52:28.760 --> 02:52:29.620]  And they spread the word.
[02:52:29.700 --> 02:52:30.379]  You meet like-minded people.
[02:52:30.479 --> 02:52:36.780]  But when you get the marked up shirts, only two of them are marked up to 50, we get some real money in to the operation.
[02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:40.020]  So if you really want to support, get the fundraiser shirts.
[02:52:40.420 --> 02:52:51.030]  Also, The posters, limited edition, back-to-back-to-back Trump win, all those are marked up where they cost us six, seven bucks to print them and to put it in the tube.
[02:52:51.190 --> 02:52:53.629]  So we make like 40-something bucks off that.
[02:52:53.670 --> 02:53:03.930]  If you really wanna support us and hang it on the wall and know you supported the second American Revolution right at the critical point, then get some of the limited edition posters as well.
[02:53:04.069 --> 02:53:05.889]  But regardless, you're gonna love the supplements.
[02:53:06.110 --> 02:53:07.389]  You're gonna wanna order again.
[02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:09.790]  We can't stay on air without your support.
[02:53:10.090 --> 02:53:11.229]  I'm suing the deep state.
[02:53:11.370 --> 02:53:12.190]  We're going after them.
[02:53:12.290 --> 02:53:18.309]  We have put all the stuff they did and the bid rigging and everything in these lawsuits and court filings.
[02:53:18.629 --> 02:53:19.770]  We're going to win this thing.
[02:53:19.889 --> 02:53:23.530]  But regardless, we've got to have money to continue to fight them and stay on air.
[02:53:23.649 --> 02:53:33.129]  So go now to thealexjonesstore.com for amazing products and know you stood with fellow Americans at the critical time to save our republic.
[02:53:34.469 --> 02:53:37.110]  Thealexjonesstore.com Thank you so much for your support.
[02:53:39.940 --> 02:53:57.350]  If by Rajat Kipling If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too,
[02:53:57.850 --> 02:54:15.659]  if you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about don't deal in lies, or being hated don't give way to hating, and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise, If you can dream and not make dreams your master,
[02:54:16.020 --> 02:54:31.920]  if you can think and not make thoughts your aim, if you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same, if you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
[02:54:32.180 --> 02:54:48.799]  or watch the things you gave your life to broken and stoop and build them up with worn-out tools, If you can make one heap of all your winnings, and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss, and lose and start again at your beginnings,
[02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:51.459]  and never breathe a word about your loss.
[02:54:51.879 --> 02:55:04.420]  If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after they are gone, and so hold on when there is nothing in you except the will which says to them, hold on.
[02:55:05.309 --> 02:55:24.770]  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings, nor lose the common touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you, but to none too much, if you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run,
[02:55:25.530 --> 02:55:28.909]  yours is the earth and everything that's in it.
[02:55:29.629 --> 02:55:34.190]  And, which is more, you'll be a man, my son.
[02:55:40.270 --> 02:55:57.010]  We're good to go.
[02:55:57.790 --> 02:55:59.850]  The Communist Chinese have to control the main universities.
[02:56:00.090 --> 02:56:01.209]  This is all confirmed.
[02:56:01.389 --> 02:56:02.190]  This is not a drill.
[02:56:02.389 --> 02:56:06.290]  Big tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[02:56:06.530 --> 02:56:08.030]  They've officially become state run.
[02:56:08.190 --> 02:56:09.170]  Apple 100%.
[02:56:09.170 --> 02:56:14.549]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship.
[02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:19.920]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones to do that.
[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:21.059]  This is happening.
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:29.059]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[02:56:29.219 --> 02:56:35.079]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[02:56:35.379 --> 02:56:43.379]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[02:56:44.040 --> 02:56:49.739]  We're good to go.
[02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:54.739]  We're good to go.
[02:56:55.120 --> 02:57:08.299]  We're good to go.
[02:57:22.499 --> 02:57:28.360]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[02:57:29.219 --> 02:57:38.180]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:43.079]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[02:57:43.280 --> 02:57:48.299]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[02:57:48.840 --> 02:57:56.360]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[02:57:56.719 --> 02:58:03.420]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[02:58:03.780 --> 02:58:09.399]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and is being used against you.
[02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:11.100]  Only your full understanding of this.
[02:58:11.260 --> 02:58:14.180]  He will break you free from this paradigm.
[02:58:14.559 --> 02:58:16.280]  I have given you the transmission.
[02:58:16.659 --> 02:58:17.479]  Now break free!
[02:58:20.909 --> 02:58:29.989]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:58:30.530 --> 02:58:31.690]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:58:32.870 --> 02:58:37.129]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:58:38.110 --> 02:58:43.750]  The administration is trying to sell it for five cents on the dollar, knowing that we're getting ready to put it up.
[02:58:44.829 --> 02:58:49.250]  And what they're doing is really an act, it's almost a criminal act.
[02:58:50.049 --> 02:58:54.809]  They know we're gonna use it, and if we don't have it, we're gonna have to rebuild it.
[02:58:55.190 --> 02:59:03.649]  And it'll cost double what it cost years ago, and that's hundreds of millions of dollars, because you're talking about a lot of wall.
[02:59:04.129 --> 02:59:06.549]  I built much more than I said I was gonna build.
[02:59:06.889 --> 02:59:13.969]  But then, after it was built, I said, we can do some more, because it's sort of like water, people flow through.
[02:59:14.639 --> 02:59:16.860]  And that will pretty much really take care of it.
[02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:22.020]  And what happened is they just, as you see, they're trying to sell it for five cents of the dollar.
[02:59:22.520 --> 02:59:27.639]  And that's really, that has nothing to do with a smooth transition.
[02:59:28.020 --> 02:59:32.319]  That has to do with people really trying to stop our nation.
[02:59:32.780 --> 02:59:40.659]  And all it means really is that we're gonna spend hundreds of millions of dollars more Not even talking about the time.
[02:59:41.299 --> 02:59:42.979]  Time would be pretty long.
[02:59:43.680 --> 02:59:49.680]  But we'll spend hundreds of millions of dollars more on building the same wall that we already have.
[02:59:50.020 --> 02:59:58.780]  And people have already come back to us that have deals at five cents and four cents and one guy at three cents on the dollar.
[02:59:59.809 --> 03:00:06.170]  And they offered to sell it back to us at more money than it costs us to build substantially.
[03:00:06.329 --> 03:00:06.850]  Can you believe it?
[03:00:07.229 --> 03:00:10.250]  So they make a deal with the United States to buy it for pennies.
[03:00:10.450 --> 03:00:13.409]  And then they call us and they say, do you want to buy it back?
[03:00:14.290 --> 03:00:18.270]  We'll sell it back to you for hundreds of dollars a foot.
[03:00:18.809 --> 03:00:21.909]  Hundreds of dollars from pennies to hundreds of dollars a foot.
[03:00:23.290 --> 03:00:24.790]  And we can't let this take place.
[03:00:25.049 --> 03:00:25.930]  Now, we're gonna go.
[03:00:26.030 --> 03:00:27.709]  I spoke with the Attorney General of Texas.
[03:00:27.709 --> 03:00:30.389]  I spoke to the senators of Texas.
[03:00:30.389 --> 03:00:31.709]  I spoke to a lot of people.
[03:00:31.909 --> 03:00:33.930]  And hopefully they'll be able to stop.
[03:00:34.030 --> 03:00:35.989]  We're gonna be having a restraining order.
[03:00:36.309 --> 03:00:38.649]  But just think about how ridiculous it is.
[03:00:38.829 --> 03:00:42.049]  And this is just people that don't want this country to succeed.
[03:00:42.250 --> 03:00:44.790]  And this has nothing to do with Democrat or Republican.
[03:00:45.309 --> 03:00:48.159]  This has to do with Common sense.
[03:00:48.360 --> 03:00:54.040]  We won on common sense, and this is maybe one of the most egregious examples I've seen.
[03:00:54.280 --> 03:01:04.379]  So the people that are buying it or trying to buy it or trying to make a deal with us to sell it back at hundreds of times more, hundreds of times more than we paid.
[03:01:05.139 --> 03:01:08.739]  And this is all because the Democrats.
[03:01:08.920 --> 03:01:13.040]  So I'm asking today Joe Biden to please stop selling the wall.
[03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:19.100]  We're going to use that to create a strong barrier And it worked.
[03:01:19.299 --> 03:01:20.979]  That's why our numbers were so good.
[03:01:20.979 --> 03:01:22.840]  It really worked, and it worked well.
[03:01:23.360 --> 03:01:25.219]  And it's very expensive to do.
[03:01:25.399 --> 03:01:29.680]  And I'm asking Joe Biden to stop his people from giving it away.
[03:01:30.200 --> 03:01:34.979]  It's something that people can't even believe is happening.
[03:01:35.200 --> 03:01:38.299]  So hopefully Joe will be able to stop it.
[03:01:38.799 --> 03:01:43.200]  We'll soon unleash American energy, and this will be done at levels not seen.
[03:01:46.750 --> 03:01:47.709]  Total sabotage.
[03:01:48.629 --> 03:01:51.889]  Just like Tom Sauer said in the last hour.
[03:01:52.170 --> 03:01:55.909]  They're doing everything they can to undermine the Trump administration because they don't want to see Trump succeed.
[03:01:57.069 --> 03:01:58.790]  And I think that we made it pretty clear.
[03:01:59.959 --> 03:02:06.860]  Between Ian Carroll's conversation and Tom Sauer's conversation in the last couple of hours, that these drones are not looking for a dirty bomb.
[03:02:07.020 --> 03:02:10.059]  They're not looking for a radioactive nuclear weapon.
[03:02:10.219 --> 03:02:14.780]  We already have way more sophisticated and proactive ways of detecting these devices.
[03:02:14.940 --> 03:02:23.639]  And even if they did exist from the Soviet era, they would likely not be functional because of the amount of resources and infrastructure needed in order to maintain these devices.
[03:02:25.239 --> 03:02:28.979]  Something else is going on With these drones.
[03:02:29.620 --> 03:02:37.719]  And yes, of course, it's the case that now that the story has received so much attention, there are hobbyists out there with their own drones flying them in the sky.
[03:02:37.940 --> 03:02:45.899]  And the Kirby's and the Mayorkas of the world can say, most of them are just commercial hobbyists or recreational hobbyists in the area.
[03:02:45.899 --> 03:02:50.020]  Maybe that's true now, but it wasn't true the first week that this was happening.
[03:02:51.180 --> 03:02:53.860]  The hobbyists that are flying now are flying in response to the story.
[03:02:53.979 --> 03:02:55.659]  The story is not in response to the hobbyists.
[03:02:55.760 --> 03:02:59.979]  It doesn't make any sense that everybody decided to fly their drone on the same day or the same couple of days.
[03:03:00.500 --> 03:03:02.340]  Out of nowhere all of the sudden.
[03:03:02.500 --> 03:03:03.799]  The story triggered these events.
[03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:08.340]  So what is going on?
[03:03:08.559 --> 03:03:12.020]  Seems to me likely a war of the world's attempt.
[03:03:12.440 --> 03:03:27.360]  I think what's happening is Is our government, our deep state understands that these escalations with Russia and China and Iran are dangerously close to manifesting into World War III. And maybe that's what they want.
[03:03:27.459 --> 03:03:31.819]  They certainly can make a lot of money, as Tom Sauer said in the last segment of World Wars, of any conflict.
[03:03:31.819 --> 03:03:34.139]  There's not a lot of money in war if you're not at war.
[03:03:36.620 --> 03:03:40.100]  And what is a major security threat to the United States?
[03:03:40.280 --> 03:03:41.139]  Well, Chinese intelligence.
[03:03:41.379 --> 03:03:44.819]  Why is it that our government has been so antagonistic toward TikTok?
[03:03:45.079 --> 03:03:46.920]  Well, Chinese intelligence, allegedly.
[03:03:48.479 --> 03:03:52.299]  And how many of these drones are manufactured in China?
[03:03:54.340 --> 03:03:56.420]  DJI, I believe those drones are made in China.
[03:03:56.559 --> 03:04:01.780]  That's one of the most popular brands, certainly one of the first to market for consumer-grade drones over 10 years ago.
[03:04:03.049 --> 03:04:18.069]  So if the government wants to hyper-regulate drone technology made in China, used by consumers because they're concerned over data or classified information being transmitted from these drones,
[03:04:18.290 --> 03:04:27.370]  perhaps unwittingly, from those who use them to the CCP in the context of World War III being imminent...
[03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:46.420]  Then it would make sense that they would try to manufacture a public scare with all of these drones in the sky in order to justify legislation around regulating away this intelligence vulnerability.
[03:04:47.899 --> 03:05:17.819]  So I believe at this point, this juncture in this story, in this development, that we have arrived at a place Where we are so close to World War III that our government is performing psychological operations on the public in an attempt to get public support for legislation similar to how they did for the Patriot Act that will decrease China's ability to surveil the United States through these recreational,
[03:05:18.200 --> 03:05:21.340]  commercial, or consumer-grade drones.
[03:05:22.120 --> 03:05:24.040]  That ties right in with the TikTok thing.
[03:05:26.059 --> 03:05:45.600]  And the fact that it's gotten to this point where we don't want China to have access to drone data of drones flying over neighborhoods because supply chains are changing, things are moving around on the continent in preparation for these conflict escalations is absolutely terrifying.
[03:05:46.420 --> 03:05:55.780]  And all we can do is hope and pray that World War III doesn't start before January 20th.
[03:05:57.309 --> 03:06:04.329]  I really hope that Trump doesn't get inaugurated and go into office having to deal with a conflict that has already gone hot.
[03:06:04.610 --> 03:06:07.549]  All right, I'm going to go straight to Eric in New York.
[03:06:07.750 --> 03:06:09.309]  Eric, what is on your mind, sir?
[03:06:10.629 --> 03:06:11.569]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:06:11.670 --> 03:06:12.670]  I'd like to make two points.
[03:06:12.770 --> 03:06:14.590]  This is Eric from courtroomwatch.org.
[03:06:14.969 --> 03:06:20.670]  Number one, don't forget the motto of the New World Order is order out of chaos.
[03:06:21.260 --> 03:06:26.600]  And through chaos, they can usually distract us from something that's going on that they don't want us to see.
[03:06:26.819 --> 03:06:29.500]  Well, sure enough, I went over and looked at what Congress is doing.
[03:06:29.659 --> 03:06:37.479]  Right now, they're reauthorizing the National Defense Authorization Act, which includes using the military against the American people.
[03:06:37.600 --> 03:06:41.659]  I'm far more worried about that than I am about the Chinese, the Russians, or the Iranians.
[03:06:42.849 --> 03:06:48.209]  And the Senate has agreed to a resolution to limit debate on that issue.
[03:06:48.209 --> 03:06:49.530]  So they don't even want to debate it.
[03:06:49.610 --> 03:06:50.469]  They don't want to talk about it.
[03:06:50.549 --> 03:06:55.930]  So while everybody's looking up at the drone swarm, Congress is pulling all kinds of chicanery.
[03:06:56.030 --> 03:06:59.709]  The second thing I wanted to mention, and then I'll get off and let another caller come in.
[03:07:00.549 --> 03:07:04.850]  There was a gentleman up here in upstate New York who went into the hospital for a series of tests.
[03:07:05.270 --> 03:07:06.569]  That included x-rays.
[03:07:06.950 --> 03:07:15.549]  And on his way home, he was driving down a country road, and a New York State trooper passed him, immediately turned around, hit his lights, and pulled the guy over.
[03:07:15.709 --> 03:07:17.209]  The guy said, geez, why'd you pull me over?
[03:07:17.270 --> 03:07:18.250]  I don't think I was speeding.
[03:07:18.489 --> 03:07:22.510]  And the trooper said, have you been to the hospital recently for any testing?
[03:07:22.690 --> 03:07:27.329]  And the guy said, yeah, as a matter of fact, I'm just on my way home from having some x-rays done.
[03:07:27.530 --> 03:07:40.399]  Well, it turns out there was enough residue from the x-rays On this gentleman's body for the New York State Troopers' radiation detecting equipment to pick up on that and cause him to pull this guy over.
[03:07:40.540 --> 03:07:44.340]  So I thought that was an interesting tidbit to offer on the radiation detection situation.
[03:07:45.139 --> 03:07:46.879]  Great call, Eric, for so many reasons.
[03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:48.680]  Fascinating story on the end, and good point.
[03:07:48.979 --> 03:07:52.399]  Usually chaos is a distraction from what's really going on.
[03:07:52.479 --> 03:07:57.879]  It's certainly a useful diversion for those who seek to conspire against the American people, the interests of humanity.
[03:07:58.100 --> 03:08:00.700]  I want to show clips 24 and 25 back-to-back.
[03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:08.860]  This is Schumer responding to the drones and talking a little bit about the Defense Authorization Act, followed by Tim Burchett making remarks as well.
[03:08:08.920 --> 03:08:09.239]  Let's watch.
[03:08:10.840 --> 03:08:20.459]  Sir, as the author of the UAP Amendment, the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, you, among anybody, should be calling these what they are.
[03:08:20.799 --> 03:08:22.180]  We don't know they're drones, correct?
[03:08:22.479 --> 03:08:23.600]  They are UAPs.
[03:08:23.780 --> 03:08:25.840]  Why aren't they being called UAPs?
[03:08:25.840 --> 03:08:28.059]  We don't know if they're UAPs.
[03:08:28.100 --> 03:08:29.360]  We don't know what they are.
[03:08:29.540 --> 03:08:31.040]  That's what we're trying to find out.
[03:08:31.780 --> 03:08:34.319]  Nobody knows what they are.
[03:08:34.459 --> 03:08:35.420]  We have to find out.
[03:08:35.879 --> 03:08:38.040]  Senator, are these U.S. military drones?
[03:08:38.920 --> 03:08:44.739]  We don't believe they're, no, we do not believe they are U.S. military drones, or the military would have told us that.
[03:08:44.979 --> 03:08:46.459]  Why have a propulsion been taken sooner?
[03:08:46.840 --> 03:08:47.459]  Why now?
[03:08:47.680 --> 03:08:48.440]  Why have a propulsion been taken?
[03:08:48.440 --> 03:08:58.059]  Well, all of a sudden, they're in the skies all over the place, and so we've got to find answers, and then the legislation will provide much more authority as to where and when drones can fly.
[03:08:58.479 --> 03:09:03.440]  Right now, there is no authority to that, because there are so many hobbyists and everybody else who flies drones.
[03:09:03.579 --> 03:09:05.440]  So you've got to figure out how to do it.
[03:09:05.629 --> 03:09:10.770]  Have you spoken with top government leaders about the possibilities involved with non-human intelligence?
[03:09:11.129 --> 03:09:15.969]  Look, we have spoken with top government leaders about finding the answers to what these are.
[03:09:16.409 --> 03:09:17.469]  We don't know what they are.
[03:09:17.670 --> 03:09:19.069]  No more, sir.
[03:09:19.250 --> 03:09:20.309]  Let other people, okay?
[03:09:20.770 --> 03:09:25.670]  When will you have a definitive answer of where they're coming from?
[03:09:25.709 --> 03:09:26.709]  The sooner the better.
[03:09:26.950 --> 03:09:32.969]  We've talked to the Homeland Security and the FBI and told them we need answers quickly.
[03:09:33.629 --> 03:09:35.190]  Hey everybody, Tim Burchett.
[03:09:35.350 --> 03:09:36.489]  Just leaving the House floor.
[03:09:36.690 --> 03:09:37.250]  It's raining.
[03:09:37.510 --> 03:09:41.229]  And I can go this way and do my video and not be hassled.
[03:09:41.530 --> 03:09:47.530]  Hey, we just passed the NDAA, National Events Authorization Act.
[03:09:48.190 --> 03:09:49.569]  I voted against it.
[03:09:49.729 --> 03:09:53.610]  There's a half a billion dollars in there, literally, of foreign aid.
[03:09:53.889 --> 03:09:58.610]  And that's kind of what y'all voted in such large numbers against.
[03:09:59.010 --> 03:10:00.229]  Tired of us being everywhere.
[03:10:01.389 --> 03:10:08.770]  There's, they allow you to travel for abortions, or they, you know, the paid or whatever to move you around so you can get that.
[03:10:09.430 --> 03:10:16.750]  There's just, the transgender language, I was told by a couple of attorneys on the House floor was poorly written.
[03:10:16.809 --> 03:10:18.069]  I think it had some holes in it.
[03:10:19.809 --> 03:10:24.329]  To make it all matters worse, nine billion new dollars.
[03:10:25.010 --> 03:10:28.069]  Senate over the Senate, it comes back with all that added on.
[03:10:28.629 --> 03:10:31.030]  You remember, the Pentagon has not passed an audit.
[03:10:31.250 --> 03:10:33.969]  They're on their seventh or eighth one that they haven't passed.
[03:10:35.170 --> 03:10:36.670]  We've got to do better in this.
[03:10:36.829 --> 03:10:39.629]  This is not what you all voted for.
[03:10:40.129 --> 03:10:49.139]  And you have members, you have family members that are lobbyists, On this stuff, I mean, it is just totally awful.
[03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:58.559]  All right, folks, I'm going to be taking your calls for the remainder of the hour until the great Owen Schroyer takes over as host of the War Room from 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:10:58.680 --> 03:11:00.280]  Central Time, so make sure you stay tuned for that.
[03:11:00.459 --> 03:11:04.079]  In the meantime, call in 877-789-2539.
[03:11:04.340 --> 03:11:07.500]  Again, that's 877-789-2539.
[03:11:08.139 --> 03:11:11.680]  Finally, 877-789-2539.
[03:11:12.059 --> 03:11:13.299]  First up is Tim in California.
[03:11:13.559 --> 03:11:15.079]  Tim, what is on your mind this afternoon?
[03:11:16.379 --> 03:11:26.040]  Hey Chase, you know, I've seen this video for years now, since the days of COVID, where Alex shows a video that says, you can't just go to the ballpark anymore.
[03:11:26.299 --> 03:11:28.639]  You can't just do this and that anymore.
[03:11:28.639 --> 03:11:30.399]  You can't sit with your friends anymore.
[03:11:30.620 --> 03:11:37.600]  But one of the things that was alarming about that, it showed the empty baseball stadiums and the empty football stadiums.
[03:11:37.659 --> 03:11:43.440]  And it showed a little drone, and it was spraying disinfectant.
[03:11:44.329 --> 03:11:47.870]  To help us all from a cold virus disease.
[03:11:48.409 --> 03:11:51.229]  And the moment I saw that, I thought, oh no.
[03:11:51.709 --> 03:11:54.430]  Oh no, that's not a good sign, right?
[03:11:54.770 --> 03:11:56.010]  That's not a good sign.
[03:11:56.190 --> 03:11:57.450]  And I wouldn't say a word.
[03:11:57.549 --> 03:11:58.590]  I would never say a word.
[03:11:58.690 --> 03:12:05.129]  But recently, just the other night, I saw Senator Tom Cotton, and he talked about these drones.
[03:12:05.250 --> 03:12:09.190]  And he talked about how it just could be hobby or whatever, blah, blah, blah.
[03:12:09.430 --> 03:12:18.409]  But at the end, he said, or it could be sarin or VX nerve gas kind of thing the next time.
[03:12:18.870 --> 03:12:20.909]  Kind of like, do you want to keep rolling the dice?
[03:12:21.110 --> 03:12:22.069]  And here's my thought.
[03:12:23.190 --> 03:12:29.649]  If you've got the Chinese, which have controls of our ports...
[03:12:30.209 --> 03:12:33.569]  They've got controls of all the containers that come in and out of the ports.
[03:12:33.829 --> 03:12:45.850]  And our own government will admit that 152,000, that's 152,000, 152,000 Chinese individuals, not families, not husbands, wives, just dudes, right?
[03:12:46.129 --> 03:12:50.790]  And you look at when they line up, they look like they're part of a NASA adventure or whatever.
[03:12:50.950 --> 03:12:51.950]  They're all in formation.
[03:12:51.950 --> 03:12:53.770]  They all have the same kind of outfit.
[03:12:53.930 --> 03:12:54.829]  They stand in formation.
[03:12:54.829 --> 03:12:56.629]  They got their little drag-around luggage.
[03:12:56.909 --> 03:12:58.469]  And I'm just thinking, hey, wait a minute now.
[03:12:58.829 --> 03:13:05.809]  They flew a Chinese spy balloon from sea to a shining sea, okay?
[03:13:06.190 --> 03:13:07.389]  And what happened?
[03:13:08.209 --> 03:13:08.690]  Nothing!
[03:13:09.329 --> 03:13:10.450]  That's what happened.
[03:13:10.750 --> 03:13:11.229]  Nothing!
[03:13:11.629 --> 03:13:15.909]  So what would make them not feel like it would be okay to give it a few more tries?
[03:13:16.389 --> 03:13:18.149]  Tell me what we can get away with.
[03:13:18.450 --> 03:13:18.930]  Absolutely.
[03:13:19.110 --> 03:13:27.110]  Of course, the difference is we spent $400,000 to shoot down each one of those balloons that they sent over, but they're not shooting down any of these drones, which implies to me that this is our own government.
[03:13:28.260 --> 03:13:40.520]  No, but look, Chase, the fentanyl alone, the fentanyl alone is 75,000 fighting age men in America dead every year for year after year after year.
[03:13:40.680 --> 03:13:45.219]  And I'm telling you, it took 10 years to kill 50,000 people in Vietnam.
[03:13:45.479 --> 03:14:00.879]  I'm telling you, We've got something happening where they're just taking over our country from China, and the people are standing down, and I believe it's because Joe's like a Manchurian candidate, and they said, look, we've given your family all these millions of dollars,
[03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:16.639]  and we're not happy with the performance you gave, and so now, just like when we flew the balloon over and you couldn't do nothing, now we're gonna do whatever we want with these, and you're not gonna do nothing either, and he's just gonna go, yes, I agree, yes, sir, because otherwise,
[03:14:17.040 --> 03:14:20.780]  How is it plausible you're going to tell me you don't know, we don't know?
[03:14:21.780 --> 03:14:22.559]  You know.
[03:14:22.899 --> 03:14:23.719]  You know.
[03:14:23.899 --> 03:14:27.739]  And if it was us, you would have by now been embarrassed enough to say so.
[03:14:27.940 --> 03:14:34.620]  And the reason you don't do nothing now is the same reason you didn't do anything with the balloon flying from sea to shining sea.
[03:14:34.879 --> 03:14:36.719]  Just an opinion I have.
[03:14:36.979 --> 03:14:37.959]  Tim, strong call.
[03:14:38.079 --> 03:14:39.159]  Thank you so much for sharing that.
[03:14:39.260 --> 03:14:39.700]  I appreciate it.
[03:14:39.739 --> 03:14:40.459]  Cody in Canada.
[03:14:40.719 --> 03:14:47.579]  Cody, what's on your mind with these implications or reports that Justin Trudeau could resign imminently?
[03:14:49.459 --> 03:14:51.420]  Well, thank you, Chase, for taking my call.
[03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:54.520]  Yeah, like Justin Trudeau, man, I can't believe it.
[03:14:54.620 --> 03:14:56.659]  We're going to celebrate God.
[03:14:57.059 --> 03:14:58.579]  It's probably going to be any day now.
[03:14:59.239 --> 03:15:00.840]  I've never met anybody who liked him.
[03:15:01.020 --> 03:15:02.459]  Have you ever met anybody who really liked him?
[03:15:03.799 --> 03:15:05.040]  No, and I'm in Canada.
[03:15:05.379 --> 03:15:05.719]  Yeah.
[03:15:07.119 --> 03:15:10.100]  Are there Trudeau bumper stickers all over the place?
[03:15:11.760 --> 03:15:13.180]  Heck no, there's not.
[03:15:13.420 --> 03:15:14.319]  I don't see one ever.
[03:15:14.799 --> 03:15:15.780]  He's just a loser.
[03:15:16.120 --> 03:15:19.100]  He's a selfish World Economic Forum puppet.
[03:15:19.280 --> 03:15:20.760]  He works for the World Economic Forum.
[03:15:20.920 --> 03:15:23.139]  And Christy Freeland just stepped down yesterday.
[03:15:23.440 --> 03:15:26.239]  And she's a direct puppet from the World Economic Forum, too.
[03:15:26.260 --> 03:15:27.680]  We have penetrates into cabinets.
[03:15:29.159 --> 03:15:30.420]  Oh, they already did.
[03:15:30.600 --> 03:15:33.500]  And so, Kendall, like you said, Infowars, you guys are right.
[03:15:34.129 --> 03:15:38.709]  Like, Canada's about four or five years ahead of the states, and so we're kind of like Europe.
[03:15:38.770 --> 03:15:42.790]  We're very similar in our economic everything, you know?
[03:15:43.510 --> 03:15:46.709]  Well, would you support the annexation of Canada into the United States?
[03:15:46.829 --> 03:15:49.690]  Should we march into Toronto and liberate you?
[03:15:50.489 --> 03:15:52.090]  I would agree.
[03:15:52.090 --> 03:15:53.829]  I would actually support that.
[03:15:54.149 --> 03:15:54.530]  Wow.
[03:15:54.610 --> 03:15:56.969]  Would we be met with thunderous applause?
[03:15:59.049 --> 03:16:04.889]  Well, in Toronto, there's a lot more immigrants, like, you know, like the more globalist control in Toronto, so...
[03:16:04.889 --> 03:16:07.930]  Yeah, well, if there's a lot of immigrants in Toronto, then they shouldn't mind a foreign force coming in.
[03:16:08.129 --> 03:16:08.870]  We already allowed it.
[03:16:08.969 --> 03:16:10.049]  Cody, thank you so much for your call.
[03:16:10.110 --> 03:16:10.629]  I appreciate it.
[03:16:10.709 --> 03:16:11.229]  Scott in Indiana.
[03:16:11.389 --> 03:16:12.090]  Scott, what's on your mind?
[03:16:13.670 --> 03:16:16.670]  Yeah, great show.
[03:16:16.889 --> 03:16:19.690]  Always enjoy seeing everything and great products.
[03:16:20.069 --> 03:16:20.450]  Thank you.
[03:16:22.549 --> 03:16:26.649]  My point is, what can we do to influence...
[03:16:27.569 --> 03:16:34.190]  Our Congressman, just like, you know, the defense builds up, now it's made back to the Senate, back to the Congress.
[03:16:36.209 --> 03:16:51.950]  Well, like in the case of the Secretary of Defense nomination, the War Room Posse on O'Bannon's show called in, and they have 50,000 to 60,000 phone calls, emails come in, and they...
[03:16:52.579 --> 03:16:54.940]  They turned the tide on that nomination.
[03:16:55.219 --> 03:17:02.280]  When we made our noise known, it came out and it's made a difference.
[03:17:02.620 --> 03:17:23.209]  And I don't know why all InfoWars type shows, Suviac, O'Bannon, you guys at least get some common line going sometimes where everybody can call in their congressman because, believe me, they don't like having an earful just like the gentleman just called just before with that venom and a little bit of,
[03:17:23.209 --> 03:17:23.809]  like, grit.
[03:17:24.030 --> 03:17:25.610]  You know, I'm upset about this.
[03:17:25.690 --> 03:17:26.870]  I want you to do something about it.
[03:17:26.870 --> 03:17:29.969]  Yeah, they don't like an aware and irate constituency.
[03:17:31.370 --> 03:17:48.729]  Yeah, when they hear that day after day, like, I know that we postpone Ukraine getting money for almost six months until Israel had to do a false flag to get another whole war thing started so they could actually fund it.
[03:17:48.790 --> 03:17:53.870]  They did not fund anything for those six months leading up until the Israeli war started up.
[03:17:54.939 --> 03:17:57.959]  It is effective to call your congressman.
[03:17:57.959 --> 03:17:59.280]  It is effective to get involved.
[03:17:59.399 --> 03:18:00.579]  It is effective to write letters.
[03:18:00.719 --> 03:18:04.920]  It is effective to make content, to share the Infowars broadcasts.
[03:18:05.280 --> 03:18:14.639]  And honestly, one of the best ways you can fight back is by going to the AlexJonesStore.com and keeping this network on the air because they hate us more than almost anybody.
[03:18:14.879 --> 03:18:16.959]  I mean, they hate Elon Musk more and they hate...
[03:18:18.110 --> 03:18:21.909]  Donald Trump more, but Infowars is right up there in the top five list.
[03:18:22.030 --> 03:18:30.690]  I mean, if there's a clip of someone that's been shown at a sham January 6th committee hearing, then chances are that's a pretty good guy.
[03:18:30.930 --> 03:18:33.530]  Chances are that's an enemy of the deep state.
[03:18:33.629 --> 03:18:40.649]  If that's a deep state operation and they are labeling Infowars or Alex Jones as the main antagonist, then that's how you know we're the good guys.
[03:18:40.750 --> 03:18:48.370]  And like I said when I was speaking with Ian Carroll earlier today, that the main reason that I support Trump is because all of the world's supervillains Hate him.
[03:18:48.549 --> 03:18:52.010]  That's also the main reason to support Infowars and Alex Jones.
[03:18:52.270 --> 03:18:55.090]  All of the world's supervillains hate us.
[03:18:55.309 --> 03:18:56.370]  They hate Alex Jones.
[03:18:56.649 --> 03:19:06.670]  Our own CIA funded a Ukrainian organization to put Alex, myself, other members of the staff on an enemies of the state list earlier this year.
[03:19:07.530 --> 03:19:11.649]  Along with 200 or 300 other voices on social media.
[03:19:12.899 --> 03:19:14.719]  They hate us because we're the good guys.
[03:19:14.840 --> 03:19:21.040]  If all the world's supervillains hate us, then the least you can do is support us by going to thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:19:22.540 --> 03:19:23.959]  You can sign up for the VIP club.
[03:19:23.959 --> 03:19:24.959]  It's $30 a month.
[03:19:24.959 --> 03:19:25.879]  You can cancel any time.
[03:19:26.040 --> 03:19:28.020]  You get $40 every month in store credit.
[03:19:28.299 --> 03:19:35.260]  So if you're going to buy a $35 shirt, might as well sign up for the VIP club, get the shirt, and then have an extra $5 to apply to another purchase.
[03:19:35.479 --> 03:19:38.059]  We've got new products coming out almost every single day.
[03:19:38.579 --> 03:19:40.620]  This week, it's been Ultimate Turmeric.
[03:19:41.430 --> 03:19:49.670]  We're good to go.
[03:19:56.219 --> 03:20:00.579]  Ultimate CMOS gummies now available for pre-order shipping before the new year.
[03:20:00.799 --> 03:20:13.459]  If you liked Survival Shield X2 or Survival Shield X3 from the InfoWars store when we were selling it, then you're definitely going to want to get the Ultimate CMOS gummies because this is an incredibly powerful, natural, and bioavailable source of iodine.
[03:20:13.540 --> 03:20:20.500]  Iodine is how our thyroid functions to eliminate the toxins from our bodies to keep us healthy.
[03:20:20.959 --> 03:20:23.139]  It's like an air filter for your whole body.
[03:20:24.530 --> 03:20:26.430]  I see reports of drones spraying.
[03:20:26.729 --> 03:20:32.729]  One caller calling in saying that there were drones spraying disinfectants over baseball stadiums during the pandemic.
[03:20:35.610 --> 03:20:37.389]  People leaving chemtrails, fine.
[03:20:37.389 --> 03:20:42.850]  If not, well, you know there's fluoride in the water and it's lowering everybody's IQ. You know there's toxins in the food and water.
[03:20:42.969 --> 03:20:45.729]  You know that the red dye in our food is linked to cancer.
[03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:48.510]  So are you iodine deficient?
[03:20:48.690 --> 03:20:49.729]  Get the CMOS gummies.
[03:20:49.809 --> 03:20:50.729]  Get the CMOS capsules.
[03:20:50.950 --> 03:20:52.049]  Make sure that you're not.
[03:20:52.350 --> 03:21:03.469]  Make sure your kids are getting enough iodine so that their little bodies can defend against this assault on our minds and our health and our freedoms.
[03:21:03.469 --> 03:21:06.549]  Please go to thealexjonesstore.com right now.
[03:21:06.829 --> 03:21:14.190]  Get anything, not only for your own health and your own mind, but for the sake of humanity and making sure that Alex Jones will always be on the air.
[03:21:14.399 --> 03:21:21.120]  My dad is chemistry background, also a retired doctor, but he came in to help me run my supplement division 13 years ago.
[03:21:21.559 --> 03:21:22.920]  The deep state sued the hell out of him.
[03:21:23.040 --> 03:21:24.340]  We're going to our guest in a moment, but I got to do this.
[03:21:24.440 --> 03:21:24.760]  Thank you, sir.
[03:21:25.340 --> 03:21:28.940]  And they basically almost destroyed my parents.
[03:21:29.059 --> 03:21:35.479]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family that my dad was at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits the Democrats filed.
[03:21:35.639 --> 03:21:39.520]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are $316 million yesterday.
[03:21:40.079 --> 03:21:40.879]  They filed before.
[03:21:41.040 --> 03:21:42.420]  They've spent $80 million suing me.
[03:21:42.579 --> 03:21:44.239]  We've spent $16 million fighting them.
[03:21:44.520 --> 03:21:46.139]  My dad spent $2 million fighting them.
[03:21:46.200 --> 03:21:47.299]  And we're finally winning.
[03:21:47.479 --> 03:21:58.819]  Not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnaturals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request I ask you to support him because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[03:21:58.940 --> 03:22:01.459]  He was giving everything to InfoWars.
[03:22:01.579 --> 03:22:09.000]  And then personally going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me because that's how dads are.
[03:22:09.389 --> 03:22:10.510]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[03:22:10.649 --> 03:22:15.530]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office.
[03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:16.770]  And I got pissed.
[03:22:17.430 --> 03:22:24.510]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[03:22:25.190 --> 03:22:26.229]  The supplements are there.
[03:22:26.409 --> 03:22:27.010]  They're great.
[03:22:27.209 --> 03:22:28.370]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[03:22:28.469 --> 03:22:29.729]  He's put everything into it he has.
[03:22:29.829 --> 03:22:30.389]  They're incredible.
[03:22:30.670 --> 03:22:40.350]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, that I don't want to belabor this.
[03:22:40.389 --> 03:22:41.629]  We have important topics to cover.
[03:22:42.489 --> 03:22:43.729]  Please support us.
[03:22:43.909 --> 03:22:45.930]  Go to drjonesadgrills.com.
[03:22:46.010 --> 03:22:46.729]  There's a new sale.
[03:22:46.950 --> 03:22:48.409]  Everything is 30% off.
[03:22:48.690 --> 03:22:58.030]  Next Level Foundational Energy, All Fluoride-Free Toothpaste, Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver, CoQ10, and Corsets and Macs that are high-end Corsets and CoQ10 for 40% off.
[03:22:58.250 --> 03:23:00.469]  Or try these other amazing products.
[03:23:00.750 --> 03:23:04.590]  Ultimate Longevity Pack for 50% off a big sale.
[03:23:04.750 --> 03:23:06.370]  And my dad literally...
[03:23:06.950 --> 03:23:12.489]  We took a loan last week to be able to buy the product that's coming in finally next week.
[03:23:12.670 --> 03:23:14.750]  Turbo Force, things like that that are popular.
[03:23:14.950 --> 03:23:17.450]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[03:23:18.030 --> 03:23:21.950]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[03:23:22.290 --> 03:23:23.610]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:24.389]  He's a fighter.
[03:23:24.489 --> 03:23:25.350]  Hell, he's my dad.
[03:23:25.489 --> 03:23:26.469]  I think I'm a fighter.
[03:23:26.690 --> 03:23:28.090]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[03:23:28.760 --> 03:23:36.319]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[03:23:36.479 --> 03:23:39.159]  But this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[03:23:39.280 --> 03:23:40.239]  It's about my parents.
[03:23:40.860 --> 03:23:46.299]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's what the enemy targeted me.
[03:23:46.799 --> 03:23:49.819]  So, please, support the Infowar today.
[03:23:50.000 --> 03:23:51.940]  Support my mother and my father.
[03:23:52.000 --> 03:23:54.940]  I'm asking it personally for you to do it now.
[03:23:55.159 --> 03:23:59.680]  And if 5% of the millions watching me go do it, all our problems will be over in one minute.
[03:23:59.780 --> 03:24:05.319]  But it's less than one half, one percent to ever buy anything from drjonesnacros.com, thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:24:05.360 --> 03:24:08.959]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight for our futures.
[03:24:09.340 --> 03:24:12.620]  So, thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnacros.com.
[03:24:12.680 --> 03:24:14.239]  I'm going to shut up at the balance of this hour.
[03:24:14.469 --> 03:24:15.989]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:16.149 --> 03:24:25.069]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host for the next 27 minutes or so before the great Owen Schroer takes over hosting The War Room with groundbreaking news from 3 p.m.
[03:24:25.149 --> 03:24:25.969]  to 6 p.m.
[03:24:26.549 --> 03:24:28.450]  His shows have been on fire lately.
[03:24:28.629 --> 03:24:30.989]  I am very excited myself to watch his analysis.
[03:24:31.170 --> 03:24:39.489]  I'm very curious to hear what he has to say about all these critical developments that have been unfolding right before our eyes ahead of this historic inauguration.
[03:24:39.670 --> 03:24:40.989]  Jenny and Marilyn, I want to go to you.
[03:24:41.129 --> 03:24:42.250]  Jenny, what is on your mind?
[03:24:42.950 --> 03:24:43.750]  Can you hear me?
[03:24:44.239 --> 03:24:44.819]  I can hear you.
[03:24:44.879 --> 03:24:45.239]  How are you?
[03:24:45.819 --> 03:24:46.440]  Hey, Chase.
[03:24:46.639 --> 03:24:46.719]  Good.
[03:24:46.780 --> 03:24:47.280]  How are you?
[03:24:47.540 --> 03:24:47.659]  Good.
[03:24:47.760 --> 03:24:48.219]  Thanks for calling.
[03:24:48.799 --> 03:24:49.200]  Good.
[03:24:49.399 --> 03:24:50.940]  Happy holidays, everyone.
[03:24:51.280 --> 03:24:51.979]  Merry Christmas.
[03:24:52.540 --> 03:24:53.139]  Thank you.
[03:24:53.260 --> 03:24:54.139]  Merry fucking Christmas.
[03:24:54.840 --> 03:24:56.219]  Merry Christmas.
[03:24:58.860 --> 03:25:00.360]  So much has been going on.
[03:25:00.360 --> 03:25:02.040]  I don't know where to begin, but...
[03:25:02.329 --> 03:25:05.729]  Do you want to just mention that I have these three supplements?
[03:25:06.110 --> 03:25:10.010]  I can't remember the names, Optimal Human, Super Green, and then an electrolyte.
[03:25:10.170 --> 03:25:11.610]  Yeah, Hydroforce, that's great.
[03:25:12.069 --> 03:25:13.670]  Yes, in one glass.
[03:25:14.430 --> 03:25:16.290]  And it tastes amazing.
[03:25:16.610 --> 03:25:20.649]  It's like an elixir from a different dimension.
[03:25:20.889 --> 03:25:21.770]  Anyway, I love it.
[03:25:22.350 --> 03:25:23.809]  Yeah, that stuff will light you up like a Christmas tree.
[03:25:25.290 --> 03:25:25.729]  Yeah.
[03:25:26.969 --> 03:25:27.409]  Well, great.
[03:25:27.569 --> 03:25:28.149]  Well, thank you for your call.
[03:25:28.270 --> 03:25:30.170]  I appreciate the plug and your support and everything.
[03:25:30.409 --> 03:25:31.489]  Let's go to Bart in Missouri.
[03:25:31.649 --> 03:25:32.329]  Bart, what's on your mind?
[03:25:34.790 --> 03:25:35.729]  Brad, Missouri.
[03:25:36.190 --> 03:25:36.870]  Excuse me.
[03:25:36.909 --> 03:25:37.489]  Sorry about that.
[03:25:37.530 --> 03:25:39.229]  I just read what they put on the board, man.
[03:25:39.430 --> 03:25:41.530]  I'm like Joe Biden with a teleprompter over here right now.
[03:25:42.510 --> 03:25:43.170]  That's so fun.
[03:25:43.510 --> 03:25:48.270]  Anyways, I called because last night we had drones flying above our air.
[03:25:48.350 --> 03:25:51.290]  I live in Kansas City in a suburb north of it, like north of the river.
[03:25:51.770 --> 03:26:04.239]  And there's like probably a Wow.
[03:26:06.200 --> 03:26:06.399]  Wow.
[03:26:08.310 --> 03:26:12.870]  There was a plane flying way higher up and they were spraying crap all over.
[03:26:12.969 --> 03:26:16.489]  So my neighbor, my buddy Bruce, he's listening to the show right now.
[03:26:16.850 --> 03:26:23.569]  But anyways, he got night vision, night vision pictures of this plane spraying over the top of our area.
[03:26:25.129 --> 03:26:26.270]  So what do you think it's spraying?
[03:26:27.329 --> 03:26:27.969]  Say what?
[03:26:28.129 --> 03:26:28.989]  What do you think they're spraying?
[03:26:30.420 --> 03:26:32.500]  Probably crap to make a stick for the new pandemic.
[03:26:33.139 --> 03:26:33.819]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:26:33.920 --> 03:26:38.299]  Have you seen all those crazy reports that they're planning to launch a new pandemic on January 21st?
[03:26:38.899 --> 03:26:39.540]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:26:39.819 --> 03:26:41.159]  I've been watching you guys every day.
[03:26:41.579 --> 03:26:42.520]  Big fan of yours, Chase.
[03:26:42.659 --> 03:26:43.659]  I watch Sunday Night Live.
[03:26:43.840 --> 03:26:44.540]  I've been watching that.
[03:26:44.680 --> 03:26:45.299]  I watch every day.
[03:26:45.479 --> 03:26:48.139]  I mean, you guys are my main source of news.
[03:26:48.840 --> 03:26:49.860]  Well, thank you for your support.
[03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:50.840]  It means a lot to us.
[03:26:51.079 --> 03:26:55.559]  Every listener is super precious, and it's because of you guys that we've been on air as long as we have.
[03:26:55.700 --> 03:26:58.719]  Now we're going to win against this assault by the new world order.
[03:27:00.069 --> 03:27:02.709]  Yeah, and I've been drinking the Hydro Force.
[03:27:02.889 --> 03:27:03.489]  Yeah, delicious.
[03:27:03.829 --> 03:27:05.790]  I've been drinking that a glass a day.
[03:27:05.930 --> 03:27:10.110]  But one thing I found out, I like the flavor, but I wanted to spice it up a little bit.
[03:27:10.149 --> 03:27:13.790]  So I just started pouring lemons, like squeezing lemons in there, making a big jar of lemonade.
[03:27:13.889 --> 03:27:16.889]  Yeah, lemon's really good with the Optimal Human, too.
[03:27:17.409 --> 03:27:18.549]  That's what Harrison Smith does.
[03:27:18.690 --> 03:27:19.329]  Yeah, I wanted to get some of that.
[03:27:20.350 --> 03:27:20.829]  But yeah.
[03:27:21.969 --> 03:27:23.370]  Well, that's all I have to say.
[03:27:23.489 --> 03:27:23.870]  Thank you, Brad.
[03:27:24.510 --> 03:27:27.649]  I appreciate your call, and thank you for letting us know about these drones.
[03:27:27.850 --> 03:27:34.110]  There have been reports, too, all over the country that these drones aren't just surveilling or searching for something or creating a defensive array.
[03:27:35.290 --> 03:27:36.989]  There have been reports that they've been spraying.
[03:27:37.729 --> 03:27:41.829]  And regardless of whether you believe in chemtrails or not, it's very obvious when you see footage of a drone.
[03:27:42.149 --> 03:27:44.610]  It's not condensation flying off a wing of a drone.
[03:27:45.090 --> 03:27:45.909]  It's spraying stuff.
[03:27:48.299 --> 03:27:50.139]  And we just have to get this administration in.
[03:27:50.219 --> 03:27:51.399]  We have to get the Kash Patels in.
[03:27:51.440 --> 03:27:52.719]  We have to get the Pete Hegseth in.
[03:27:52.799 --> 03:27:55.719]  We have to get the Department of Government Efficiency Operational.
[03:27:56.719 --> 03:27:59.479]  With Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk.
[03:27:59.620 --> 03:28:09.399]  And you know that they're terrified of DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, because Gavin Newsom has come out criticizing it, saying that, oh, it's just a public relations or a marketing operation.
[03:28:09.399 --> 03:28:16.000]  There's no real power with DOGE. This is clip number 22 of Gavin Newsom making some comments about the Department of Government Efficiency.
[03:28:16.239 --> 03:28:17.479]  Let's watch this and unpack it.
[03:28:22.819 --> 03:28:24.139]  Clip number 22, please.
[03:28:25.690 --> 03:28:32.829]  Through the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk has been working very hard with various people, including Vivek.
[03:28:33.709 --> 03:28:38.850]  We're going to eliminate hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and fraud.
[03:28:38.989 --> 03:28:43.229]  And I can only tell you, I'll give you a little early report, they're finding things that you wouldn't even believe.
[03:28:43.950 --> 03:28:46.930]  So we're looking to save maybe two trillion dollars.
[03:28:47.829 --> 03:28:49.069]  And it'll have no impact.
[03:28:49.309 --> 03:28:52.149]  Actually, it'll make life better, but it'll have no impact on people.
[03:28:52.329 --> 03:28:56.049]  It's not like we will never cut Social Security, things like that.
[03:28:56.250 --> 03:28:58.350]  It's just waste, fraud, and abuse.
[03:28:58.950 --> 03:29:01.629]  We've been working, I don't know, before Doge was Doge.
[03:29:01.750 --> 03:29:03.750]  I don't know what, this is just like a promo project.
[03:29:04.649 --> 03:29:06.770]  We've been doing civil service reform in this state.
[03:29:06.950 --> 03:29:08.989]  We've been consolidating job classifications.
[03:29:09.190 --> 03:29:10.350]  We've been updating job descriptions in the state.
[03:29:10.350 --> 03:29:12.809]  95% of all new jobs last year in California were government.
[03:29:13.010 --> 03:29:14.569]  And we waived those requirements.
[03:29:15.170 --> 03:29:21.430]  And in fact, I think it was in August, earlier August, we came up with your shop.
[03:29:21.569 --> 03:29:23.770]  We're gonna double that next year.
[03:29:24.129 --> 03:29:28.290]  In fact, by 32,000, it'll be 62,000 positions.
[03:29:29.040 --> 03:29:32.719]  We will have eliminated those barriers in that requirement.
[03:29:32.940 --> 03:29:34.579]  So California has been a leader in that space.
[03:29:35.219 --> 03:29:40.059]  He just looks like he's been designed by a focus group, a leftist focus group in California.
[03:29:40.799 --> 03:29:46.180]  Over 95% of all new jobs in California last year were government jobs, and he's bragging about California efficiency.
[03:29:47.319 --> 03:29:49.739]  It's deficient in every meaningful possible way.
[03:29:49.920 --> 03:29:50.780]  I lived there.
[03:29:51.139 --> 03:29:52.360]  The weather was beautiful.
[03:29:52.520 --> 03:29:53.420]  Everything else was terrible.
[03:29:54.620 --> 03:29:56.979]  It's like going to hell, but there's a beach.
[03:29:58.079 --> 03:29:58.860]  You're still in hell.
[03:29:59.920 --> 03:30:04.319]  You're not really enjoying the beach if you're damned and separated from God for all of eternity, are you?
[03:30:05.920 --> 03:30:13.280]  And it feels like a spiritual vacuum when you go there and you mingle and you get to know some of the locals and all the new age stuff that's going on and the occult behavior.
[03:30:16.520 --> 03:30:20.280]  It's almost like a spiritual black hole in California.
[03:30:20.520 --> 03:30:21.600]  There's a lot of great people there.
[03:30:21.700 --> 03:30:22.299]  A lot of very nice people.
[03:30:22.399 --> 03:30:23.020]  Love my in-laws.
[03:30:23.219 --> 03:30:24.579]  Some of the best people I've ever met.
[03:30:26.110 --> 03:30:27.069]  I'm not trying to knock it.
[03:30:27.389 --> 03:30:29.469]  Tom Sauer was our guest last hour.
[03:30:29.590 --> 03:30:30.149]  He lives in Newport.
[03:30:30.549 --> 03:30:32.209]  Just 30 minutes from where I lived.
[03:30:32.709 --> 03:30:43.309]  But I'm telling you, there is a force field around California attempting to separate the population from God and hope.
[03:30:44.069 --> 03:30:49.010]  And the only thing allowed through that force field are 20 million undocumented immigrants.
[03:30:51.149 --> 03:31:06.680]  So, Gavin Newsom with his focus group haircut And his focus group comments and his focus group personality can say all he wants all day long about how efficient and wonderful and beautiful and powerful California is.
[03:31:07.540 --> 03:31:09.100]  But he's not just wrong.
[03:31:09.739 --> 03:31:10.639]  He's lying.
[03:31:12.680 --> 03:31:20.959]  State income tax goes up to 13% in California on top of the federal income tax you pay, averaging 25%, if not more, all the way up to 40%.
[03:31:20.959 --> 03:31:29.479]  So if you live in California and you make substantial money, Even if you don't, but let's just say you make a couple hundred thousand dollars a year.
[03:31:30.559 --> 03:31:41.399]  Between property tax, sales tax, state income tax, social security, federal income tax, like three out of every five days that you work, you're working for the government.
[03:31:43.299 --> 03:31:44.420]  That's not freedom.
[03:31:47.399 --> 03:31:48.260]  That's tyranny.
[03:31:48.520 --> 03:31:48.940]  It's slavery.
[03:31:51.239 --> 03:31:59.780]  I think that any tax over 50%, at least, really any tax at all, any income tax at all, any non-voluntary tax, is a violation of the 13th Amendment.
[03:32:00.180 --> 03:32:00.899]  It's slavery.
[03:32:01.379 --> 03:32:13.840]  But if more than half of your life, if the product or the value of more than half of your life, your time, the stuff life's made of, goes to the government, are you a free person?
[03:32:18.360 --> 03:32:20.579]  Oh, but there's a really nice beach and it's so sunny outside.
[03:32:20.920 --> 03:32:32.920]  Yeah, but you can't go to the beach if there's a fake pandemic that we funded in a lab in China that they leaked intentionally in order to undermine an administration getting elected that could do something about the injustice in California.
[03:32:34.399 --> 03:32:41.819]  Between the cartels and the political class and the Pelosi's and the Newsom's and the Schiff's.
[03:32:43.659 --> 03:32:46.920]  It's like the capital of super villainy there.
[03:32:49.239 --> 03:32:57.639]  Every time I see him, I'm struck with a sense of post-traumatic stress disorder because I escaped.
[03:32:59.979 --> 03:33:19.459]  And I remember what it was like to know that being the first one at the office and the last one to leave when I lived there was only necessary because the state of California deemed me a subject Of their corruption.
[03:33:21.180 --> 03:33:24.059]  You hand the check over to the enemy every year.
[03:33:26.540 --> 03:33:27.739]  But the weather's nice.
[03:33:28.440 --> 03:33:29.579]  Go to Sonny in Ohio.
[03:33:29.819 --> 03:33:31.780]  Sonny, what's on your mind?
[03:33:34.290 --> 03:33:35.809]  My name is Sonny Thomas.
[03:33:36.129 --> 03:33:39.209]  I run Resolution Radio at resolutionrdo.com.
[03:33:39.469 --> 03:33:42.930]  And I'm always supporting Alex in every way I can.
[03:33:42.930 --> 03:33:47.129]  And I always encourage people, no matter how small you think you are, do your own podcast.
[03:33:47.469 --> 03:33:51.709]  Because of the fact that your opinion counts just as much as anyone else.
[03:33:53.930 --> 03:33:55.329]  Correct.
[03:34:01.750 --> 03:34:03.149]  Correct.
[03:34:16.149 --> 03:34:17.889]  Something you say will take off.
[03:34:17.989 --> 03:34:26.069]  Even if you don't run with something right away, some young buck may come along and take your idea and actually do something with it, and it comes to fruition.
[03:34:26.350 --> 03:34:33.190]  So I don't care if it's going to your local city councils or whatever the case may be, because a lot of times those are taped and put on cable.
[03:34:33.750 --> 03:34:35.229]  And other people watch those.
[03:34:35.370 --> 03:34:43.729]  If you're a senior citizen, talk about issues that concern you, and then some young guy may come along and take that baton and run with it.
[03:34:43.790 --> 03:34:55.250]  But Some commentary you were saying yesterday You were talking about, you know, there's an individual you said to actually put his hands on one of the missing bombs.
[03:34:55.350 --> 03:34:55.670]  Yes.
[03:34:55.829 --> 03:34:57.530]  Apparently that were missing from the Ukraine.
[03:34:57.809 --> 03:35:03.510]  I mean, when you were talking about them, let's just say the drones were possibly looking for this thing, right?
[03:35:03.750 --> 03:35:14.290]  It's literally right out of the film, some of all fears with Morgan Freeman, because the fact that they literally hit a small nuke in a vending machine in a stadium.
[03:35:14.790 --> 03:35:20.469]  So, why wouldn't they put something in D.C. somewhere possibly on January 20th?
[03:35:20.530 --> 03:35:21.450]  I mean, think about that.
[03:35:21.569 --> 03:35:32.329]  I mean, that's where the whole TV show was at The Last Survivor with Kiefer Sutherland where he's, you know, he's got the lotteries and he gets out and then the whole...
[03:35:32.329 --> 03:35:33.409]  Yeah, designated survivor.
[03:35:34.309 --> 03:35:35.670]  Yeah, designated survivor, yeah.
[03:35:35.930 --> 03:35:38.829]  So, I mean, that scenario could very well happen.
[03:35:39.270 --> 03:35:42.590]  And so, I just hope...
[03:35:42.920 --> 03:35:45.299]  It doesn't happen, but I hope that there is something.
[03:35:46.059 --> 03:35:57.719]  Well, I tell you what, if a dirty bomb goes off or a nuke goes off in the next month in the United States, I'm confident that it was a setup, just like the pipe bomber on January 6th that they haven't identified.
[03:35:59.239 --> 03:36:01.399]  The reason they haven't identified him is because it was a Fed.
[03:36:01.719 --> 03:36:07.440]  If something like this happens, it's not because some terrorist was sophisticated enough to smuggle something dangerous into the country.
[03:36:07.559 --> 03:36:23.399]  It's because our government allowed it to happen either by opening the borders and sponsoring this person coming in with this weapon or by doing it themselves and putting the isotopes into it to blame it on Russia and escalate World War III. So if something happens in the next 30 days in the United States,
[03:36:23.399 --> 03:36:25.100]  it's a false flag operation.
[03:36:25.579 --> 03:36:26.420]  Don't buy it.
[03:36:26.860 --> 03:36:27.559]  What do you think?
[03:36:28.739 --> 03:36:37.260]  You know, when the thing goes off, I might assume it was Russia, even though the analyst said there's no way it could have been him because it's not the guy's character.
[03:36:37.479 --> 03:36:39.500]  But they all might want to assume it was Russia.
[03:36:40.040 --> 03:36:49.319]  So that DOG situation like you were talking about, I can see where all those chips can be laid out and try to be played because they've created this scenario.
[03:36:50.159 --> 03:36:50.540]  Absolutely.
[03:36:51.100 --> 03:36:52.180]  Sonny, thank you so much for your call.
[03:36:52.260 --> 03:36:53.079]  I really appreciate it.
[03:36:53.200 --> 03:36:55.739]  Let's go to Mark in California.
[03:36:55.920 --> 03:36:56.579]  Mark, what's on your mind?
[03:36:57.590 --> 03:36:59.549]  Hey, thank you for taking my call.
[03:36:59.549 --> 03:37:01.190]  I really appreciate the show.
[03:37:01.370 --> 03:37:01.770]  You're welcome.
[03:37:01.930 --> 03:37:02.250]  Thank you.
[03:37:02.950 --> 03:37:19.690]  So I wanted to bring up my point about the Federal Reserve and what Jerome Powell said last Wednesday and why it just points out that he should be terminated the first month of President Trump's new election,
[03:37:19.690 --> 03:37:21.489]  his run in office.
[03:37:21.790 --> 03:37:22.030]  Sure.
[03:37:22.270 --> 03:37:30.979]  So the point is, is Last Wednesday, he said our $36 trillion deficit is unsustainable.
[03:37:31.239 --> 03:37:35.940]  Okay, you hire a financial planner and you say, hey, you're a financial planner.
[03:37:36.180 --> 03:37:40.520]  You tell me what my future is going to be from 10 years from now.
[03:37:40.719 --> 03:37:43.959]  They can pretty much tell you where you're going to be 10 years from now.
[03:37:44.139 --> 03:37:48.959]  This guy should have been bringing up this information 10 or 15 years from now.
[03:37:49.139 --> 03:37:51.979]  This is like my car going off.
[03:38:03.599 --> 03:38:17.579]  Or this is like the guy that watches somebody set their house on fire, and then when the house is fully engulfed, he decides to call the fire department and says, hey, there's a house on fire.
[03:38:17.829 --> 03:38:19.950]  I'm wondering what you're thinking about this.
[03:38:19.950 --> 03:38:21.549]  I think you're absolutely right.
[03:38:21.809 --> 03:38:25.569]  I actually have an assignment for everybody in the audience who has access to a computer.
[03:38:26.389 --> 03:38:30.389]  I ask that everyone in the audience go to chatgpt.com.
[03:38:30.530 --> 03:38:31.469]  There's a free version.
[03:38:31.590 --> 03:38:32.309]  You won't have to log in.
[03:38:34.069 --> 03:38:35.829]  If you don't want to use chatgpt, try Grok.
[03:38:35.909 --> 03:38:37.809]  I haven't done this on Grok, but I've done it on chatgpt.
[03:38:38.629 --> 03:38:54.149]  And ask chatgpt what would be the effects or the implications of Of the United States government paying off all of its debt at once and not taking on any new debt.
[03:38:55.309 --> 03:39:07.799]  And you will see a response so shocking and terrifying That it should wake you up or anyone you know up as to the problem with our monetary system.
[03:39:08.079 --> 03:39:09.500]  So ask ChatGPT.
[03:39:09.620 --> 03:39:10.579]  Go to ChatGPT.com.
[03:39:10.739 --> 03:39:11.260]  Ask it.
[03:39:11.360 --> 03:39:18.280]  What would happen if the United States government paid off all of its debt at once and stopped taking new debt, balanced the budget?
[03:39:18.520 --> 03:39:20.520]  You know, something that we think sounds very reasonable.
[03:39:20.840 --> 03:39:22.879]  Take a screenshot of that information.
[03:39:23.800 --> 03:39:25.420]  Response from ChatGPT.
[03:39:25.639 --> 03:39:28.479]  Go to my ex-profile at realchasegeyser.
[03:39:29.000 --> 03:39:30.719]  This show is the pinned tweet.
[03:39:31.120 --> 03:39:39.420]  And just, I want you to post the screenshot of what ChatGPT says to you as a reply to my sharing of this broadcast on my ex-account.
[03:39:39.479 --> 03:39:40.159]  Because I want to see what...
[03:39:40.159 --> 03:39:47.739]  The problem is, we have a fractional reserve banking system based off of a fiat currency not backed by anything real.
[03:39:49.530 --> 03:39:55.610]  In a fractional reserve banking system based on fiat is inherently a Ponzi scheme.
[03:39:55.790 --> 03:40:00.829]  And the only way that it can continue to work is if the scheme gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
[03:40:00.989 --> 03:40:02.790]  If the debt gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
[03:40:02.930 --> 03:40:12.290]  If we paid off all of the debt, the entire world economy would collapse because our monetary system is dependent on debt.
[03:40:14.139 --> 03:40:16.120]  And I'm not saying that we shouldn't pay off all the debt.
[03:40:16.299 --> 03:40:27.120]  I'm saying that we should have honest money, because if the money was honest, actually backed by real value, precious metals, then we would be able to pay off all the debt without any harm.
[03:40:27.120 --> 03:40:29.379]  It would actually be beneficial, just like your personal finances.
[03:40:29.399 --> 03:40:30.979]  You pay off your debt, that's great for you.
[03:40:31.559 --> 03:40:45.329]  But since our whole entire global reserve currency economy is a lie, Then paying off the debt exposes the lie, the scheme is up and it collapses.
[03:40:45.989 --> 03:40:56.809]  And since the scheme itself is the foundation of the global economy because of our global reserve status, that means total global economic collapse.
[03:40:56.989 --> 03:41:08.590]  And I know it's inevitably going to happen no matter what, but if we don't find a way to safely dismantle and disassemble This weapon of mass destruction right before us.
[03:41:08.709 --> 03:41:10.069]  It's like looking at the blue wire and the red wire.
[03:41:10.190 --> 03:41:25.909]  If we don't find a way to very carefully unravel this bomb right in front of our faces and put in a new monetary system in a predictable and delicate way,
[03:41:25.909 --> 03:41:28.290]  the bomb's going to go off.
[03:41:29.370 --> 03:41:30.569]  So you pay off all the debt?
[03:41:30.690 --> 03:41:31.850]  That's cutting the wrong wire explosion.
[03:41:32.270 --> 03:41:33.709]  You don't pay off any of the debt?
[03:41:34.700 --> 03:41:36.700]  It's cutting the other wrong wire, explosion.
[03:41:37.579 --> 03:41:41.959]  The only difference is, is it going to explode now or is it going to explode later?
[03:41:42.180 --> 03:41:44.860]  So we have to come up with a new monetary system.
[03:41:44.959 --> 03:41:56.659]  And people talk a lot of crap about John Maynard Keynes, the economist that advocated for our banking system and our reserve status after World War II. And there are many reasons to criticize that economist.
[03:41:57.899 --> 03:42:01.879]  Ron Paul for years has been talking about the difference between Keynesian economics and Austrian economics.
[03:42:02.000 --> 03:42:04.500]  I don't want to get into an academic course about it.
[03:42:05.100 --> 03:42:23.049]  But what people often overlook about John Maynard Keynes is that when he We're good to go.
[03:42:32.190 --> 03:42:45.229]  But had he known that we would have officially gone off of the gold standard in the 70s, I don't think he ever would have advocated for this fractional reserve banking system and this global reserve status because he would have understood that it would inevitably implode.
[03:42:45.329 --> 03:42:46.290]  All right, let's go to another call.
[03:42:46.629 --> 03:42:49.250]  Let's go to Kevin in New York.
[03:42:49.409 --> 03:42:50.229]  Kevin, what's on your mind, sir?
[03:42:52.139 --> 03:42:52.700]  Hey, Chase.
[03:42:52.940 --> 03:42:54.719]  First off, I want to say Merry Christmas.
[03:42:54.920 --> 03:42:55.440]  Merry Christmas.
[03:42:55.680 --> 03:42:56.600]  And thank you to you and all your staff.
[03:42:57.440 --> 03:43:06.120]  I'd like to say there's a lot of little things I think all of us can do, especially people that live by main highways, specifically all throughout New York State and the rest of the country.
[03:43:06.659 --> 03:43:14.459]  We should figure out a way that we can all organize with a common theme, like maybe I'm Alex Jones or just something very simple and just master it.
[03:43:14.760 --> 03:43:15.340]  Everywhere.
[03:43:16.059 --> 03:43:32.739]  And something I would love to see you guys do is possibly put up a section where you have a community board, where our biggest issue is that sometimes people have great ideas, but they can't connect to the audience that you built and the money that you spent building this little army together.
[03:43:32.979 --> 03:43:37.420]  So it would be, I think, a fantastic idea if somehow you guys could put something up.
[03:43:37.799 --> 03:43:44.100]  For example, just going on leftist websites and trolling them and playing their own game.
[03:43:45.229 --> 03:43:45.649]  Sure.
[03:43:45.649 --> 03:43:46.069]  Absolutely.
[03:43:46.209 --> 03:43:46.770]  Anything you can do.
[03:43:46.889 --> 03:43:48.090]  Every listener is precious.
[03:43:48.649 --> 03:43:51.590]  And just like the other caller said, starting a podcast is great.
[03:43:51.709 --> 03:44:00.729]  Even if you only have 25 regular listeners, that's 25 times the influence that you have compared to if you didn't do it.
[03:44:01.389 --> 03:44:03.250]  Because everybody has influence over themselves.
[03:44:03.790 --> 03:44:09.350]  Before I had a voice, before I started podcasting, my opinion was only reflected in my vote.
[03:44:09.489 --> 03:44:14.030]  If you have a podcast and 25 followers, your opinion is now reflected in 25 votes.
[03:44:15.059 --> 03:44:16.959]  It doesn't have to be millions of viewers.
[03:44:17.159 --> 03:44:18.620]  It doesn't have to be thousands of viewers.
[03:44:19.579 --> 03:44:21.120]  Every listener is precious.
[03:44:21.159 --> 03:44:29.940]  If you can change the heart of one person, if you can wake one person up, that is enough to justify the effort because we're talking about the future of humanity, folks.
[03:44:30.879 --> 03:44:34.299]  And that's why I'm so proud to work at Infowars for Alex Jones.
[03:44:35.399 --> 03:44:44.479]  Even if I disagreed with him, which I don't, but even if I disagreed with him about virtually everything, I would still be proud to work here because this place has become a symbol of freedom of speech.
[03:44:46.950 --> 03:45:03.950]  And the deep state satanic apparatus that has tried at every level to shut this organization down, this operation down, is so evil and corrupt and,
[03:45:04.190 --> 03:45:08.049]  frankly, cancerous.
[03:45:11.250 --> 03:45:12.989]  That it must be combated at all costs.
[03:45:13.209 --> 03:45:22.610]  If you don't want to start a podcast, if you don't want to do the research and figure out what cameras to get, what soundboard to get, how to broadcast on all the platforms, then go to the alwaysjonesstore.com and support us.
[03:45:23.090 --> 03:45:31.569]  Because we are fighting in the new world order with what we say, with the audience that we reach, with the lawsuits that we file.
[03:45:32.370 --> 03:45:39.770]  I mean, this place is financially fighting the new world order, the time and commitment of this crew and these hosts.
[03:45:40.600 --> 03:46:11.989]  are dedicated to fighting the new world order and the broadcast that reaches millions upon millions of people worldwide is waking up an entire generation of human beings on this planet created by God to the evil and insidious and corrupt and audacious Forces
[03:46:11.989 --> 03:46:17.649]  that seek to manifest themselves as the antithesis of God himself.
[03:46:18.610 --> 03:46:24.670]  Because you understand that God's main expression was creation.
[03:46:28.770 --> 03:46:33.969]  And these organizations, institutions, philosophies, movements...
[03:46:36.049 --> 03:46:40.010]  That are antithetical to creation itself are inherently satanic and adversarial.
[03:46:42.610 --> 03:46:52.670]  That which destroys creation, that which advocates against humanity, is that which defies God most.
[03:46:52.790 --> 03:46:54.569]  It's the number one form of blasphemy.
[03:46:55.530 --> 03:46:58.010]  It's the number one form of heresy.
[03:46:59.049 --> 03:47:04.229]  To defy God because he created all that which exists.
[03:47:05.770 --> 03:47:08.969]  Folks are coming up on our break in about 90 seconds.
[03:47:09.350 --> 03:47:10.809]  There's a couple of products I want to tell you about.
[03:47:11.010 --> 03:47:12.750]  Optimal Human is back in stock.
[03:47:12.850 --> 03:47:14.930]  It's an amazing, super green food.
[03:47:15.110 --> 03:47:18.170]  It's incredibly competitive to all the others, both in price.
[03:47:18.170 --> 03:47:19.569]  It's even better in terms of substance.
[03:47:19.870 --> 03:47:22.629]  It's got every vitamin, mineral the body needs pretty much.
[03:47:23.229 --> 03:47:30.370]  Vitamin A, C, D, E, K, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, B12. You drink this every day, you're going to feel great.
[03:47:31.049 --> 03:47:32.250]  Lights me up like a Christmas tree.
[03:47:32.510 --> 03:47:34.989]  Harrison Smith was the first one around here to really start taking it every day.
[03:47:35.510 --> 03:47:37.870]  He makes it, puts a lemon in it, makes him feel great.
[03:47:38.110 --> 03:47:40.190]  He doesn't even drink it later in the day because it'll keep him up.
[03:47:40.290 --> 03:47:40.989]  It gives you that much energy.
[03:47:41.090 --> 03:47:42.350]  It's not even designed to be an energy drink.
[03:47:42.430 --> 03:47:45.090]  It's just so good for you that you naturally have more energy.
[03:47:45.209 --> 03:47:47.370]  We've also got Hydroforce, which is a great pre-workout.
[03:47:47.469 --> 03:47:49.030]  It'll make sure that you stay hydrated.
[03:47:49.270 --> 03:47:52.309]  A new coin, Donald Trump Take America back coin is now available.
[03:47:52.469 --> 03:47:55.850]  It's just $15 right now at the AlexJonesStore.com.
[03:47:56.010 --> 03:48:12.379]  On one side, it says President of the United States, Donald J. Trump with It's an awesome, awesome coin to have.
[03:48:12.479 --> 03:48:14.360]  These campaign coins are a great way to support the store.
[03:48:14.540 --> 03:48:19.879]  If you don't want to spend more money on other products, we try to offer a diverse product.
[03:48:22.079 --> 03:48:33.299]  Set of options so you can spend as much or as little as you want and still know that you're supporting the Infowar, that you're fighting for freedom, that you're fighting for humanity, all while getting awesome merchandise, awesome products, and healthy supplements.
[03:48:33.559 --> 03:48:36.739]  Stay tuned for Owen Schroyer on the other side with The War Room.
[03:48:37.440 --> 03:48:44.879]  Well, the winner, Chris DiLaro, is here in studio from New Jersey, former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[03:48:44.879 --> 03:48:46.000]  What an amazing aircraft.
[03:48:46.219 --> 03:48:47.659]  Chris, I gotta say, man, we love you.
[03:48:47.739 --> 03:48:48.479]  Thanks for the support.
[03:48:49.180 --> 03:48:49.979]  I love you, Alex.
[03:48:50.180 --> 03:48:52.260]  I love Bigley, Nate, Colin.
[03:48:52.500 --> 03:48:52.899]  Thanks, Chris.
[03:48:52.979 --> 03:48:58.079]  This is one of the pinnacles in my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there, just being in this studio.
[03:48:58.079 --> 03:48:59.239]  I never imagined I'd be.
[03:48:59.239 --> 03:49:00.219]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[03:49:00.299 --> 03:49:00.920]  You're the reason we're here.
[03:49:01.180 --> 03:49:03.479]  It's so cool how cool the listeners are.
[03:49:03.559 --> 03:49:03.959]  It is.
[03:49:04.319 --> 03:49:04.440]  Yes.
[03:49:04.639 --> 03:49:05.139]  Oh, thank you.
[03:49:05.379 --> 03:49:06.440]  The listeners are amazing.
[03:49:06.680 --> 03:49:12.440]  Like, everyone that goes to the Alex Jones store, obviously you're in it to win this truck, but this experience of coming on the show, how is this, Chris?
[03:49:12.600 --> 03:49:16.299]  I mean, is this not, this is like a, it's a dream, I would feel like, for the winner, right?
[03:49:16.459 --> 03:49:27.719]  Fortunately, I slept pretty good last night, but it's been very stressful because he said, Colin said, you're going on the show, and I was like, I'm a little camera shy, but here I am.
[03:49:27.840 --> 03:49:29.000]  And I've done well, old Vader.
[03:49:30.020 --> 03:49:32.399]  I said, I'll do whatever I need to do to help Alex and Big Lee.
[03:49:33.000 --> 03:49:34.219]  Well, I'm glad I got to meet you.
[03:49:34.260 --> 03:49:36.079]  We're going to eat some barbecue from Terry Black's here in a minute.
[03:49:36.420 --> 03:49:37.799]  I'm starting to mouthwater when you said that.
[03:49:37.940 --> 03:49:38.399]  Oh, I'm starving.
[03:49:38.520 --> 03:49:42.520]  Now, real quick, this is all done by a computer, by a professional company.
[03:49:42.739 --> 03:49:43.860]  I was talking to you guys before.
[03:49:44.420 --> 03:49:45.760]  Sometimes it's in the middle of it.
[03:49:45.799 --> 03:49:46.620]  Sometimes it's at the end.
[03:49:46.700 --> 03:49:47.600]  Sometimes it's at the start.
[03:49:48.360 --> 03:49:50.799]  Have you seen where somebody who entered on the first day won?
[03:49:51.510 --> 03:49:56.790]  Honestly, we've done probably 30 of these giveaways and have never seen someone win on the very first day.
[03:49:56.969 --> 03:50:02.610]  But we have these multipliers that go into place maybe at the first week and the last week of the giveaway, right?
[03:50:02.729 --> 03:50:05.930]  And during these multipliers, if you spend $10, you get 100 entries.
[03:50:05.950 --> 03:50:08.030]  If you spend $100, you get 1,000 entries, right?
[03:50:08.200 --> 03:50:10.680]  It's a 10x multiplier for when you enter during that time period.
[03:50:10.840 --> 03:50:13.540]  You actually enter during the 10x time period, right?
[03:50:13.879 --> 03:50:16.540]  And at the end of the giveaway, we run the 10x time period as well.
[03:50:16.639 --> 03:50:19.059]  So it was one of the best times to enter to win.
[03:50:19.360 --> 03:50:22.120]  And, I mean, you got, you know, more entries for how much you spent.
[03:50:22.139 --> 03:50:23.639]  With the new contest, where are we right now?
[03:50:23.809 --> 03:50:27.069]  It's a brand new Ford F-250 Super Duty trimmer.
[03:50:27.209 --> 03:50:27.670]  It's sick.
[03:50:27.829 --> 03:50:29.069]  It's all black, jacked up.
[03:50:29.309 --> 03:50:31.030]  It's Alex Jones verified for sure.
[03:50:31.270 --> 03:50:32.250]  He picked the wheels.
[03:50:32.389 --> 03:50:33.110]  He picked the tires.
[03:50:33.350 --> 03:50:34.129]  It looks good.
[03:50:34.250 --> 03:50:34.530]  I don't know.
[03:50:34.629 --> 03:50:35.649]  Yeah, we're showing it right here.
[03:50:35.850 --> 03:50:38.569]  It also comes with $10,000 in cash as well.
[03:50:38.809 --> 03:50:39.549]  Chris, do you have that on you?
[03:50:39.709 --> 03:50:41.250]  Yeah, this is not a hoax, people.
[03:50:41.670 --> 03:50:49.850]  He is the winner of all the thousands of folks that came to thealexjonesstore.com and got products to be entered to win or just put your email in for free and you're entered to win.
[03:50:50.010 --> 03:50:54.309]  He bought two t-shirts, ladies and gentlemen, and he won this incredible super truck.
[03:50:54.450 --> 03:50:55.469]  Somebody can be like Chris.
[03:50:55.590 --> 03:50:57.129]  They can go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:50:57.170 --> 03:51:09.209]  They can order the great CMOS, order any of the great supplements, t-shirts, hats, whatever, and you're entered to win a badass, brand new F-250 trimmer, fully loaded pickup truck, and you get $10,000 in cash, and we fly you down here.
[03:51:09.440 --> 03:51:10.159]  You get to meet Alex.
[03:51:10.299 --> 03:51:10.959]  You get to be on the show.
[03:51:11.100 --> 03:51:13.459]  If you just enter your email, you're still entered to win.
[03:51:13.639 --> 03:51:15.420]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:51:15.540 --> 03:51:16.180]  Enter your email.
[03:51:16.520 --> 03:51:17.540]  Join the VIP club.
[03:51:17.739 --> 03:51:20.920]  I promise you next week what you'll get for being in the VIP club.
[03:51:21.079 --> 03:51:22.159]  You'll be very excited.
[03:51:22.379 --> 03:51:26.739]  I knew folks would love the last truck, and I know you'll love this truck as well.
[03:51:27.040 --> 03:51:29.739]  Another incredible pickup truck.
[03:51:30.059 --> 03:51:32.620]  Super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[03:51:32.780 --> 03:51:33.739]  It's a beautiful truck.
[03:51:34.319 --> 03:51:39.680]  Super high ratings and you get $10,000 in cash on top of it for the lucky winner.
[03:51:39.840 --> 03:51:57.079]  A 2024 Ford F-250 Super Duty Diesel Tremor Edition, 6.7 liter high output power stroke diesel engine with 500 horsepower and 1,200 lb-ft per torque, 2-inch ready lift kit, 37-inch Toyo off-road tires,
[03:51:57.500 --> 03:52:03.639]  20-inch black Rhino wheels, 12-inch touchscreen with 360-degree cameras to see all around the truck.
[03:52:04.260 --> 03:52:05.540]  Well, it's a kick-ass truck.
[03:52:05.739 --> 03:52:07.940]  I'm sorry to see it go, but it's going to a great guy, Chris.
[03:52:08.079 --> 03:52:09.280]  Chris, love you, brother.
[03:52:09.500 --> 03:52:10.059]  Love you, man.
[03:52:10.120 --> 03:52:10.379]  Thank you.
[03:52:10.819 --> 03:52:12.799]  Somebody's about to get this sweetheart right here.
[03:52:13.319 --> 03:52:16.260]  And listen, they said I could drive it while I was down here for the last month and a half.
[03:52:16.440 --> 03:52:17.219]  Only drove it once.
[03:52:17.600 --> 03:52:18.540]  Things are too nice.
[03:52:18.840 --> 03:52:20.739]  The winners are going to get these pristine trucks.
[03:52:21.200 --> 03:52:23.500]  So, we'll see you at thealkshowstore.com, and thanks for all your support.
