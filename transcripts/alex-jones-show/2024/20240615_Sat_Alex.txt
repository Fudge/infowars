[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:11.063]  I mean, it's just wild that these people, because I'm Alex Jones, and because the corporate media has been attacking me, are so pissed that when they make fake court filings that I'm stealing money, I'm not supposed to get upset.
[00:00:12.104 --> 00:00:15.708]  When they try to lock me out of the building outside of law, I'm not supposed to get upset.
[00:00:16.636 --> 00:00:25.660]  When they came here with all these people, because I have gun safes here, when they first got assigned a year and a half ago, and literally were like, going, like, are you nervous?
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.080]  Are you nervous?
[00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:26.781]  Are all these legal?
[00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:28.061]  And I'm like, yeah, man, they're just guns.
[00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:29.142]  They're all bought at gun shops.
[00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:30.022]  I have no criminal record.
[00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:30.703]  Yeah, right.
[00:00:31.683 --> 00:00:35.945]  Serial numbers, taking photos, looking at me, oh, oh, God, oh, God, oh, oh, oh.
[00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:38.927]  I mean, just, they're like from another world.
[00:00:40.047 --> 00:00:41.608]  They're like pod people.
[00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:50.972]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[00:01:12.463 --> 00:01:14.084]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:01:17.904 --> 00:01:25.706]  It's Saturday, June 15, 2024.
[00:01:28.146 --> 00:01:29.367]  It is 10 a.m.
[00:01:29.467 --> 00:01:35.788]  Central Standard Time coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:01:37.428 --> 00:01:53.224]   Well, as I warned you, You know, last week at this Friday hearing yesterday in Houston at the federal courthouse, the CRO appointed by the court was going to try to remove me and have me thrown out of the building.
[00:01:54.946 --> 00:01:57.407]  And sure as hell, he got up on the stand and said that.
[00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.370]  And the judge listened to all the testimony.
[00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.854]  And at the end of the day, after eight hours, he told the CRO, he says, you got one action left.
[00:02:07.374 --> 00:02:09.836]  You hand those bank accounts over to Alex Jones.
[00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:12.216]  And you're done.
[00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:28.965]  People found it really hard to believe that two weeks ago, two Fridays ago, the private security firm that I hired many years ago, but they're a separate company, that's how it works, were told by this guy that he's the boss, get rid of me.
[00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:30.686]  Shut the doors.
[00:02:32.647 --> 00:02:37.349]  The judge said no fewer than 10 times yesterday, Alex Jones is the owner of InfoWars.
[00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.031]  Alex Jones is in charge of InfoWars.
[00:02:44.949 --> 00:03:01.254]  Now that said, when this CRO went around here that the judge appointed, and he just goes off a group of people he's able to, and I accepted it because I had no idea what was going to happen, that the CRO reports back to the court.
[00:03:02.614 --> 00:03:05.735]  And then if the court disagrees with what I'm doing, the judge could override me.
[00:03:06.756 --> 00:03:08.976]  That's how it works in this type of bankruptcy I was in.
[00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:19.390]   To be 100% clear, The new type of bankruptcy I'm in is personal seven total liquidation, which I'd already liquidated in my 11.
[00:03:21.732 --> 00:03:23.393]  So you hear court orders liquidation?
[00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:25.054]  No, I asked the court to do that.
[00:03:25.435 --> 00:03:29.458]  When you see the CNN headline, Jones defeated, all his massive assets given up.
[00:03:29.538 --> 00:03:39.285]  I didn't have a bunch of assets and they were already given up because I'm trying to get through this and prove the world that I don't have hundreds of millions of dollars and didn't do all the things they said, which is now coming out everywhere.
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.600]  So this is a big deal.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.302]  I mean, every news channel in the country, top of Yahoo, top of X, top of Facebook, is nothing but Alex Jones.
[00:03:48.422 --> 00:03:51.863]  It is literally as big as the O.J.
[00:03:51.883 --> 00:03:52.503]  Simpson trial.
[00:03:52.623 --> 00:03:53.323]  It is everywhere.
[00:03:53.343 --> 00:03:58.104]  And it's the corporate media saying, look, he's having everything taken away because he is a disinfo operative.
[00:03:58.204 --> 00:03:58.424]  No.
[00:03:59.304 --> 00:04:04.406]  The system has come after me and basically made up and exaggerated the things I never even said.
[00:04:04.426 --> 00:04:07.526]  And claimed I did things I didn't do.
[00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:10.007]  And had rigged show trials where I was already found guilty.
[00:04:11.155 --> 00:04:15.217]  To then create such a giant judgment that that would scare everybody away from telling the truth.
[00:04:15.957 --> 00:04:17.318]  This is about intimidating you.
[00:04:18.338 --> 00:04:20.599]  But it's not working, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:34.225]  So to be 100% clear, in Chapter 7, and I agreed to the new trustee, who's very respected by the way, I do not now own InfoWars.
[00:04:35.057 --> 00:04:35.497]  I owned it.
[00:04:35.657 --> 00:04:36.897]  I was the total controller of it.
[00:04:36.917 --> 00:04:37.998]  The bankruptcy I was in.
[00:04:38.538 --> 00:04:39.558]  Patrick McGill was not.
[00:04:39.598 --> 00:04:42.299]  He told everybody he was and tried to literally do a mutiny and throw me out.
[00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:53.682]  Under the new system, my personal Chapter 7, I own InfoWars, is now owned by or controlled by the trustee and the judge made it clear.
[00:04:55.262 --> 00:04:56.762]  The court trustee is now the owner.
[00:04:57.903 --> 00:04:58.903]  This is important information.
[00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:00.323]  This is facts, not what you see in the news.
[00:05:01.043 --> 00:05:02.964]  I am the CEO and the decision maker.
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.683]  And if the new owner, as of now, I no longer, as of last night when the judge signed the order, am no longer the owner of InfoWars.
[00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:13.765]  Now, Pat McGill said that's what he was.
[00:05:13.805 --> 00:05:14.945]  He wasn't in the code.
[00:05:15.285 --> 00:05:16.026]  It was 100% clear.
[00:05:17.886 --> 00:05:20.428]  Now, there could be a sale of InfoWars and I stay on.
[00:05:22.168 --> 00:05:23.469]  Now a settlement could be reached.
[00:05:23.549 --> 00:05:35.890]   This gives us three, four, five months of runway because if I didn't do this, as I told you, They were going to close the doors last night and Patrick McGill got up and said, Jones is out.
[00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:37.912]  I'm going to sell off the remaining product.
[00:05:37.932 --> 00:05:42.295]  I'm going to keep enough employees on for the shopping cart and stuff.
[00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:43.415]  And that's it.
[00:05:46.197 --> 00:05:50.000]  So as I told you, I don't cry wolf and people are like, well, why are you still on air?
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.541]  Two weeks ago, they tried to kick you out and close the doors.
[00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:56.364]  And now because I'm fighting, this is what a fight looks like.
[00:05:59.346 --> 00:06:04.648]  And I know it's a cliffhanger, like every week we could be shut down the last few weeks because this is what's going on.
[00:06:05.208 --> 00:06:08.049]  You're like watching Muhammad Ali versus Joe Frazier right here.
[00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.510]  I mean, this is a battle.
[00:06:13.451 --> 00:06:24.795]  And if we make it a few more months, which I think there's very good chances we are, and if we make it that, we'll survive under new management and ownership, but I'll still be a host here, and I'll still be in control of what I say or I won't be here.
[00:06:27.496 --> 00:06:28.636]  But we just got more runway.
[00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.152]  It's like in a video game where you're down to one life and you get another life.
[00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:36.275]  We were down to one life, surrounded, fighting the main boss.
[00:06:36.695 --> 00:06:38.817]  We just beat the main boss and we got another life.
[00:06:39.137 --> 00:06:41.119]  Now we got two lives going to the next level.
[00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.120]  That's a video game analogy, but it's pretty good.
[00:06:45.482 --> 00:06:46.182]  So that's where we are.
[00:06:47.844 --> 00:06:52.727]  And when I walked out, all the leftists were New York Times, all of them screaming at me, hundreds of press.
[00:06:53.868 --> 00:06:55.789]  All right, Jones, you think you're still surviving?
[00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:57.050]  You'll get shot down soon.
[00:06:57.851 --> 00:06:58.992]  We'll get you in state court.
[00:07:00.603 --> 00:07:01.104]  Exactly!
[00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:04.303]  But you didn't get me today.
[00:07:11.144 --> 00:07:21.144]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:10.712]  I had no more moves.
[00:07:13.035 --> 00:07:15.497]  They were literally trying to lock me out of the building without a court order.
[00:07:15.537 --> 00:07:16.638]  The judge flipped out over this.
[00:07:16.678 --> 00:07:18.580]  Totally, in my view, illegal.
[00:07:20.278 --> 00:07:23.141]  And the judge kept saying to the CR on the stand, you are not the owner.
[00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:24.242]  You are not the boss.
[00:07:24.302 --> 00:07:24.963]  It's Mr. Jones.
[00:07:24.983 --> 00:07:25.904]  He said it at least 10 times.
[00:07:26.644 --> 00:07:28.426]  And Pat McGill would say, no, I'm in charge.
[00:07:29.087 --> 00:07:30.548]  And the judge would just shake his head.
[00:07:30.608 --> 00:07:33.010]  This was cuckoo stuff.
[00:07:34.632 --> 00:07:43.640]  But I ask you, what would make this leftist and the Chapter 5 trustee that's like his best buddy that came into this case, who also the U.S.
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:56.380]   a trustee was there, via the Justice Department, and was recommending that I be thrown out last night.
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.860]   Before I got back from Houston, I'd be locked out of the building.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.540]  They set it on the stand.
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:07.940]   Said all those people, and I saw who you were, and it's not about me, but I saw instantly two weeks ago,
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.780]   when I made the emergency announcement, key, fake, conservative accounts.
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:17.080]   You don't really know who they are, gotten popular, say Jones is lying, it's a hoax, it's a PR stunt, blah blah blah.
[00:08:17.308 --> 00:08:23.152]  And I saw the unified script they were all putting out, these hundreds of accounts, and I went, ah, that's the government.
[00:08:23.332 --> 00:08:25.174]  Those people have been paid to do this.
[00:08:25.514 --> 00:08:33.040]  So remember who said I lied and who said that we weren't about to be shut down two weeks ago and at this Friday hearing.
[00:08:33.908 --> 00:08:37.290]  And I said, they're going to ask for me to be fired, removed.
[00:08:38.731 --> 00:08:46.375]  And even to my lawyers, Pat McGill, Thursday, had meetings with him over the phone and said, I'm just resigning.
[00:08:46.515 --> 00:08:48.096]  I'm leaving tomorrow, Friday.
[00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:50.617]  No, this is not going to happen.
[00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:53.599]  Alex is just going to have the company give it back to him.
[00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:54.659]  I'm done.
[00:08:54.679 --> 00:09:02.624]  And then he marches into court and says, I want a Chapter 7 conversion on the company, giving it over to the Connecticut Democrat Party plaintiffs.
[00:09:03.786 --> 00:09:07.108]  So I had to do my own seven to say, nope, boom, I'm doing it.
[00:09:07.309 --> 00:09:09.570]  So that it's another trustee and not them.
[00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:15.054]  Who's respected, will actually try to get value out of the company for the quote creditors.
[00:09:15.515 --> 00:09:16.875]  Because that's what the judge said.
[00:09:16.896 --> 00:09:18.537]  He goes, this, you guys don't want money.
[00:09:18.697 --> 00:09:19.738]  You just want to shut him down.
[00:09:20.058 --> 00:09:22.620]  And he goes, my job is not shutting down talk show hosts in America.
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:23.821]  We still have a first amendment.
[00:09:24.081 --> 00:09:25.362]  It was an incredible hearing.
[00:09:26.442 --> 00:09:27.083]  Eight hours long.
[00:09:28.924 --> 00:09:30.025]  They took an hour and a half break.
[00:09:30.265 --> 00:09:31.466]  Judge wanted to read the transcript.
[00:09:31.746 --> 00:09:32.507]  They were dumb enough.
[00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:48.436]  The globalist lawyers and Pat McGill to give him transcripts, full certified transcripts of that emergency Saturday, Sunday and Monday show where I laid out the whole history and the judge said he went and read it all.
[00:09:49.536 --> 00:09:51.757]  And they thought that was going to hurt me?
[00:09:52.398 --> 00:09:56.280]  That they tried to hijack the company and said they were above the judge?
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.241]  I settled that on air.
[00:09:58.217 --> 00:10:06.339]  And that McGill ran around the office saying I deserve to be in jail for my speech and that we shouldn't be on air because I'm criticizing the wonderful vaccines.
[00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:07.939]  Everybody knows it's a lie now.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.000]  So this was crazy.
[00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:15.821]  Absolutely bonkers.
[00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:23.188]   So I've got very respected Financial advisors and companies.
[00:10:23.568 --> 00:10:25.529]  We've already been through the bankruptcy in 2011.
[00:10:25.569 --> 00:10:26.569]  They already know I didn't lie.
[00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:29.070]  It was all testified that everything I said was true.
[00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.951]  Our books were in somewhat disarray.
[00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:34.372]  Once the IRS audited us and they did our books, we were owed money.
[00:10:34.792 --> 00:10:36.473]  My dad and myself.
[00:10:37.854 --> 00:10:39.434]  What you heard in the news, none of it was real.
[00:10:40.715 --> 00:10:44.576]  Yeah, our books weren't the best, but the taxes were always paid and we're overpaid.
[00:10:45.457 --> 00:10:47.298]  Once they got them all organized, they're like, shoot.
[00:10:47.338 --> 00:10:48.478]  Yeah, you guys did everything you said you did.
[00:10:50.259 --> 00:10:55.872]   So, That's where this is, and I know a lot of you are tuned in, wanting to know the truth of what happened.
[00:10:55.872 --> 00:10:59.252]  But the larger issue is, why is this all over every damn channel?
[00:10:59.252 --> 00:11:01.292]  Because they're trying to spin it to scare everybody.
[00:11:01.292 --> 00:11:09.072]   Well, if you question narratives in the future, when the globalists are trying to use a tragic event, or stage a tragic event, whatever the case may be,
[00:11:09.072 --> 00:11:15.272]  they want to be able to intimidate everybody not to have their own opinion.
[00:11:12.987 --> 00:11:14.849]  Intimidate everybody not to have their own opinion.
[00:11:15.289 --> 00:11:33.944]  Even though I was already being sued at the time, when I saw Jesse Smollett in the story, the next day, a few years ago, four years ago, five years ago, saying, it was 2.30 in the morning, I went out in sub-zero temperatures to a subway, and two guys dumped bleach on me in MAGA gear, and said, this is MAGA country, and cut my face.
[00:11:34.825 --> 00:11:40.289]  Before we ever saw the police video or any of them come to the house, there was a little string around his neck, and like a fake scratch on his face.
[00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.271]  I said, that's fake!
[00:11:43.701 --> 00:11:44.681]  My gut is that's fake.
[00:11:45.422 --> 00:11:49.243]  Now whether I'm wrong or right, I'm allowed to say I think something's fake.
[00:11:52.323 --> 00:11:58.825]  Remember the black NASCAR driver that said people hung nooses in his pit area?
[00:11:59.606 --> 00:12:05.427]  And you go down the whole pit area, the garages, and there's just loops on the garage doors.
[00:12:05.447 --> 00:12:07.228]  Those are not power doors where you can pull it.
[00:12:07.248 --> 00:12:07.908]  Everybody has that.
[00:12:10.191 --> 00:12:12.192]  So, I said, that's fake.
[00:12:12.893 --> 00:12:14.394]  Now, I'm not always right about stuff.
[00:12:14.434 --> 00:12:16.996]  I'm right 95% of the time, but I'm allowed to be wrong.
[00:12:18.216 --> 00:12:30.364]  They also got up, both the plaintiff's lawyers and the CRO that almost successfully hijacked this company and said, oh, your honor, we need to shut it down because there's guns at the office.
[00:12:31.305 --> 00:12:31.905]  It's dangerous.
[00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:32.526]  The judge goes, hmm.
[00:12:33.286 --> 00:12:35.388]  They go, yeah, there's people there with guns.
[00:12:39.295 --> 00:12:43.557]  And then the left gets up and goes, the lawyers go, we don't know there's license for those.
[00:12:44.118 --> 00:12:45.218]  We don't know it's legal.
[00:12:45.258 --> 00:12:47.839]  We need to, we need to close the doors.
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.702]  They actually said this in court because he allows guns in the building.
[00:12:52.742 --> 00:12:53.042]  Okay.
[00:12:53.082 --> 00:12:57.004]  Number one, anybody that's got a concealed carry can carry a gun here.
[00:12:58.345 --> 00:12:59.245]  That makes it safer.
[00:12:59.365 --> 00:13:00.026]  It makes it great.
[00:13:00.926 --> 00:13:05.929]  But plus Texas passed a law now where everybody can carry guns without a damn permit.
[00:13:06.826 --> 00:13:07.906]  I think you should go take the class.
[00:13:07.966 --> 00:13:08.547]  It's good to have.
[00:13:09.067 --> 00:13:09.467]  I like it.
[00:13:09.947 --> 00:13:10.488]  I have a permit.
[00:13:11.088 --> 00:13:12.228]  But it's not a permit to own a gun.
[00:13:12.268 --> 00:13:19.191]  It's a permit to the state systems, you know, particularly be within that subsect of the law to be protected from businesses and stuff that try to mess with you.
[00:13:21.612 --> 00:13:29.195]  But I feel so good that we've got armed security and some people in the control room right now are wearing handguns on their side.
[00:13:29.335 --> 00:13:29.656]  I love it.
[00:13:31.396 --> 00:13:32.517]  Some are concealed, some are open.
[00:13:34.048 --> 00:13:34.989]  I mean, I got a fist.
[00:13:35.869 --> 00:13:37.990]  I mean, I can grab a hammer and beat your brains out.
[00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.891]  Can I go to the store and buy a hammer?
[00:13:39.971 --> 00:13:40.151]  Yeah.
[00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:41.472]  Can I buy a butcher knife?
[00:13:42.352 --> 00:13:43.133]  Can I buy a baseball bat?
[00:13:44.153 --> 00:13:50.036]  So yeah, my office is fortified in that we're not cowards.
[00:13:50.056 --> 00:13:54.378]  But imagine the leftist view of McGill and the Democratic Party lawyers.
[00:13:55.358 --> 00:13:57.399]  They actually said, we want the company shut down.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.522]  We want Jones out because there's guns in the building.
[00:14:05.759 --> 00:14:10.123]  There's a security threat, they said, in keeping it open because he allows guns in the building.
[00:14:11.464 --> 00:14:13.286]  This is Texas, Dumbo!
[00:14:14.387 --> 00:14:19.411]  You claim you're from here, and you're there literally... That's another headline!
[00:14:20.372 --> 00:14:25.977]  Democrat Party lawyers, what they are, want InfoWars shut because they carry guns.
[00:14:27.892 --> 00:14:29.032]  Well, I mean, there's a gun right here.
[00:14:29.752 --> 00:14:30.753]  There's a gun in my truck.
[00:14:31.193 --> 00:14:32.233]  There's a gun in my office.
[00:14:32.653 --> 00:14:33.453]  Never been a problem.
[00:14:33.833 --> 00:14:38.355]  I mean, I've had guns in my studio for over 25 years.
[00:14:40.675 --> 00:14:46.176]  Because maybe the security guys are in the bathroom or they're dealing with something else and somebody busts in here trying to shoot us.
[00:14:46.717 --> 00:14:48.177]  I'm just gonna start shooting.
[00:14:49.127 --> 00:14:51.428]  I mean, why does a cat have teeth?
[00:14:51.488 --> 00:14:54.029]  Why does a bear have teeth?
[00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:56.951]  Why do animals have defenses?
[00:14:57.011 --> 00:14:58.211]  Because that's what we've got.
[00:14:59.552 --> 00:15:02.233]  So, this was insane.
[00:15:03.333 --> 00:15:08.296]  You can't record federal court, but a lot of people sat there and wrote notes off what was going on.
[00:15:09.736 --> 00:15:12.878]  And I'm sure some people dialed into the audio of it and probably did record it.
[00:15:13.818 --> 00:15:15.719]  So I wouldn't be surprised if a copy of it doesn't go out.
[00:15:15.739 --> 00:15:16.639]  It's not going to be us that does it.
[00:15:16.659 --> 00:15:17.680]  I never violate court rules.
[00:15:18.997 --> 00:15:25.980]  But it was epic, absolutely epic to watch all this unfold and to see this going on.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.860]  And imagine you're here, you know the law.
[00:15:28.361 --> 00:15:29.901]  I was an LLC, I'm the owner.
[00:15:30.641 --> 00:15:36.023]  You can only have a CRO as a manager if it's an LLC bankruptcy if the owner is not in Chapter 7.
[00:15:36.484 --> 00:15:39.125]  And he just said, I'm the boss, I don't care.
[00:15:39.645 --> 00:15:41.125]  And the judge said, you are not the boss.
[00:15:41.205 --> 00:15:43.586]  Alex Jones has never not been in control of his company.
[00:15:44.186 --> 00:15:50.103]   Alex Jones has never under federal law, do you understand, under Congress, And McGill said, nope, I'm in control.
[00:15:50.763 --> 00:15:52.644]  And the judge was like, okay.
[00:15:52.664 --> 00:15:58.527]  You're going to hand over the bank accounts to Mr. Jones immediately and you are not involved.
[00:15:59.068 --> 00:16:03.170]  And then he looked at the trustees that this guy brought in.
[00:16:04.875 --> 00:16:06.115]  And he said, and you're off the case too.
[00:16:06.235 --> 00:16:18.099]  I mean, it's just wild that these people, because I'm Alex Jones, and because the corporate media has been attacking me, are so pissed that when they make fake court filings that I'm stealing money, I'm not supposed to get upset.
[00:16:19.119 --> 00:16:22.720]  When they try to lock me out of the building outside of law, I'm not supposed to get upset.
[00:16:23.666 --> 00:16:32.691]  When they came here with all these people, because I have gun safes here, when they first got assigned a year and a half ago, and literally were like, going, like, are you nervous?
[00:16:32.751 --> 00:16:33.131]  Are you nervous?
[00:16:33.151 --> 00:16:33.831]  Are all these legal?
[00:16:33.851 --> 00:16:35.112]  And I'm like, yeah, man, they're just guns.
[00:16:35.172 --> 00:16:36.192]  They're all bought at gun shops.
[00:16:36.252 --> 00:16:37.053]  I have no criminal record.
[00:16:37.273 --> 00:16:37.753]  Yeah, right.
[00:16:38.714 --> 00:16:40.134]  Serial numbers, taking photos, looking at me.
[00:16:40.435 --> 00:16:42.216]  Oh, oh, God.
[00:16:43.176 --> 00:16:45.977]  I mean, they're like from another world.
[00:16:47.077 --> 00:16:55.757]   they're like pod people i mean i'm in the federal courthouse
[00:16:54.383 --> 00:16:55.744]  I mean, I'm in the federal courthouse.
[00:16:55.784 --> 00:17:00.647]  Almost all the federal marshals were listening, shaking my hand, telling me they all know it's a scam.
[00:17:00.807 --> 00:17:01.567]  They don't care if there's cameras.
[00:17:01.607 --> 00:17:02.528]  I was shaking all their hands.
[00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:20.639]  And I felt safe when I walked out of the courtroom that they had two sharp-looking federal marshals with their blue blazer jackets on, and they had their hands sitting right there, off the street, in the corner, with their guns.
[00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:23.873]  Did I go, oh my god, there's people with guns!
[00:17:24.033 --> 00:17:24.714]  I'm dead!
[00:17:24.754 --> 00:17:26.956]  They're gonna kill me right now!
[00:17:27.216 --> 00:17:27.936]  The gun's for me!
[00:17:28.177 --> 00:17:30.679]  No, the gun isn't for me because I don't have a gun.
[00:17:31.019 --> 00:17:32.040]  I'm not threatening anyone.
[00:17:33.241 --> 00:17:37.784]  But there were so many people all over the courthouse trying to get in the courthouse, trying to get in the back doors of the courthouse.
[00:17:37.804 --> 00:17:39.766]  There was hundreds of my listeners all over the place.
[00:17:39.806 --> 00:17:41.267]  We love Alex Jones, drive him on a honky.
[00:17:41.487 --> 00:17:44.290]  And weird, crazy leftist, one walked over and shook my hand.
[00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.051]  He goes, I hope you effin' kill yourself.
[00:17:47.412 --> 00:17:49.274]  Right next to a federal marshal that was standing there.
[00:17:51.417 --> 00:17:52.923]  So this went on and on.
[00:17:52.983 --> 00:17:55.272]  It was a complete three-ring circus.
[00:17:57.062 --> 00:18:01.525]  And I know that McGill, when I asked for security, he had his own security now.
[00:18:01.545 --> 00:18:02.165]  He's so important.
[00:18:02.826 --> 00:18:04.687]  He goes, you get one security person.
[00:18:04.967 --> 00:18:06.908]  And my security guy is a great guy with the company.
[00:18:07.469 --> 00:18:08.790]  He was just like really nervous.
[00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.371]  He was like, oh my God, we need four people for this.
[00:18:10.831 --> 00:18:14.213]  We pull up, there's like 100 TV cameras, press, people.
[00:18:14.533 --> 00:18:16.555]  And we're like, this is where I get killed.
[00:18:17.075 --> 00:18:21.398]  But they had federal marshals outside, obviously, knowing this was serious.
[00:18:21.418 --> 00:18:26.261]  So if anybody would have tried anything, I have a little seeking suspicion there was a couple of snipers here and there, which there were.
[00:18:27.375 --> 00:18:31.240]  So that's how crazy this was yesterday.
[00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:38.929]  But the moral of the story is the good guys with the guns protect everybody from the bad people with guns.
[00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:45.918]  So we need more good people to learn how to use guns responsibly, legally, and lawfully to outnumber the bad people.
[00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:49.603]  And I could go on for hours, but we've got huge news.
[00:18:50.524 --> 00:18:53.066]  There is massive economic insanity going on.
[00:18:53.106 --> 00:18:57.290]  There's major economic attacks on Russia, who's been winning the economic war so far.
[00:18:58.952 --> 00:19:03.096]  Daniel Esselin is going to be popping in with the post-analysis of last week's Bilderberg Group.
[00:19:03.957 --> 00:19:08.301]  Dr. Kirk Elliott is going to be popping in with massive news as well.
[00:19:09.562 --> 00:19:20.742]   And I'm going to invite Daniel, when he comes on like over an hour, I've got to leave soon because I've got to get on an airplane and go to a secret mission that you'll be hearing about in the next 48 hours.
[00:19:22.882 --> 00:19:26.323]  So a lot of interesting things going on and happening.
[00:19:29.104 --> 00:19:31.385]  Also, Elon Musk has been reposting a lot of our material.
[00:19:31.405 --> 00:19:32.405]  We appreciate that.
[00:19:33.513 --> 00:19:38.397]  I had Tucker on, as you know, yesterday, and I said, I think he needs to be protected and defended.
[00:19:38.757 --> 00:19:42.040]  He's really stuck his neck out, and I think we're idiots if we don't back him.
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:49.205]  Elon Musk responded and reposted and said, to Jones' comments on X, I think I better beef up security.
[00:19:50.326 --> 00:19:51.867]  So he riffs off, I think, I think.
[00:19:51.907 --> 00:19:52.968]  Yeah, we're thinking.
[00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.713]  So, people know that I've got a zeitgeist.
[00:20:00.259 --> 00:20:01.420]  And I know what I'm talking about.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.880]  And smart people listen to me.
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:08.083]  I'm not trying to brag about it, but I mean, I don't know anybody else who's got a track record as accurate as mine, which is scary.
[00:20:08.543 --> 00:20:10.884]  And it's why the enemy hates my guts, folks.
[00:20:10.924 --> 00:20:16.087]  It's why there's every channel that's corporate is controlling me right now.
[00:20:18.388 --> 00:20:19.268]  Because they know.
[00:20:19.368 --> 00:20:20.589]  How does this guy know this stuff?
[00:20:20.609 --> 00:20:21.710]  How does he understand this stuff?
[00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.191]  How does he see through all of this?
[00:20:26.724 --> 00:20:29.145]  And it's because I've been doing this for 30 years.
[00:20:29.245 --> 00:20:30.066]  It's all I do.
[00:20:30.846 --> 00:20:32.727]  I am completely and totally focused.
[00:20:32.767 --> 00:20:42.853]  And I want to thank all of you, most importantly, for your incredible support over the years and standing with us and this amazing crew, what they've gone through in this fight.
[00:20:44.554 --> 00:20:45.694]  And I want to be 100% clear.
[00:20:46.975 --> 00:20:48.636]  I am not a drama queen and people know that.
[00:20:50.976 --> 00:20:58.059]  I can't believe about a third of the people out there, because of the disinfo, thought nobody's trying to lock the doors and throw Jones out.
[00:20:58.139 --> 00:21:01.361]  Come on, without a court order, we'd see it in the news, it's not true.
[00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:03.242]  No shit, Sherlock.
[00:21:04.862 --> 00:21:06.023]  That's why I was freaked out.
[00:21:06.143 --> 00:21:07.103]  That's why I slept up here.
[00:21:07.123 --> 00:21:08.464]  I'm like, are they about to kill Trump?
[00:21:08.804 --> 00:21:09.625]  I'm not that important.
[00:21:09.745 --> 00:21:17.088]  Why would they have federally appointed people outside of law lock me out of the building with no court order?
[00:21:17.248 --> 00:21:18.289]  I'm like, this is crazy.
[00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:34.810]  And, you know, then the Democrat Party people that, you know, use the Sandy Hook folks as their front group, did file the next Monday to shut me down.
[00:21:35.811 --> 00:21:37.631]  That was 12 days ago.
[00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:42.012]  And then they filed for this court hearing to shut us down.
[00:21:42.052 --> 00:21:42.912]  The judges are going to decide.
[00:21:43.192 --> 00:21:44.492]  So I'm like, this could be our last day.
[00:21:44.732 --> 00:21:49.293]  And sure enough, the CRO gets up there, court appointed, and says, yeah, I want him off the air today.
[00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.131]  We don't want Alex Jones there.
[00:21:53.932 --> 00:22:06.399]  And even though raising money would have made a lot of money, a product, even if it was given to these people for the judgment, the so-called Sandy Hook lawyers get up and say, we don't want the money.
[00:22:06.419 --> 00:22:07.860]  We want to shut down today.
[00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:11.062]  That's all in court.
[00:22:12.603 --> 00:22:16.846]  So again, I ask you the big question, why are they so desperate?
[00:22:17.346 --> 00:22:20.208]  Why do they want us shut down now?
[00:22:21.055 --> 00:22:23.496]  Now in the center room, I am in charge of InfoWars.
[00:22:23.636 --> 00:22:24.436]  I am the CEO.
[00:22:24.476 --> 00:22:25.857]  The judge said I make the decisions.
[00:22:27.337 --> 00:22:30.098]  There is a new court appointed and he's very respected.
[00:22:30.118 --> 00:22:30.518]  Don't even know who.
[00:22:30.658 --> 00:22:32.159]  Everybody said, wow, that's like the best guy in Houston.
[00:22:32.199 --> 00:22:32.759]  I'm great.
[00:22:33.779 --> 00:22:36.260]  And we were very, very, very, very pleased by it.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:45.443]  And so he was there and he is now in his court appointed position in the top of Anchor Shadhead.
[00:22:45.923 --> 00:22:47.604]  Not the CEO, the owner.
[00:22:49.042 --> 00:22:51.105]  And now I'll tell the crew, I'll follow the court.
[00:22:51.185 --> 00:22:58.974]  If this guy shows up, says close the doors, you know, the judge might, the judge is the final guy because the judge, this individual, then me.
[00:22:59.495 --> 00:23:00.376]  But here's the deal.
[00:23:00.456 --> 00:23:01.618]  I can hire and fire.

[00:25:17.528 --> 00:25:18.889]  You're not the tail, you're the dog.
[00:25:19.469 --> 00:25:23.051]  Without your prayer, without your word of mouth, without your support, we would be defeated.
[00:25:23.412 --> 00:25:26.113]  But together as a family, we are changing the world.
[00:25:26.153 --> 00:25:32.877]  So go to DRJonesNaturals.com, and I thank you so much for supporting this operation in our fight against the globalists.
[00:25:34.158 --> 00:25:41.381]  But they've been giving the orders, shut us down, silence us, but there's still a few good judges, like the one appointed by Trump, Judge Lopez.
[00:25:42.962 --> 00:25:51.165]  And very, top of his class, very respected, did a great job, just followed the law down the line.
[00:25:51.445 --> 00:25:55.867]  My lawyers are top lawyers, they go, if he just follows the law, you're getting your company handed back and McGill's fired.
[00:25:56.627 --> 00:26:01.269]  They said it's outrageous he tried to kick you out of the building when there's no law to do that.
[00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:02.530]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:26:03.749 --> 00:26:07.592]  I mean, if a cop out of uniform pulls you over and tries to take you to jail, he goes to jail.
[00:26:08.352 --> 00:26:09.033]  That's the equivalent.
[00:26:09.053 --> 00:26:16.898]  This is a court-appointed officer, outside of his jurisdiction, off-duty is the equivalent of doing that.
[00:26:17.679 --> 00:26:18.980]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:25.824]  But again, a lot of these old people, I'm not putting down old people in general, but these leftist old people, they still think mainstream media is king.
[00:26:25.864 --> 00:26:27.826]  They still think they're operating however they want.
[00:26:28.346 --> 00:26:31.228]  They still think, well, your honor, he's got guns in his office.
[00:26:31.268 --> 00:26:31.989]  The judge is like, what?
[00:26:33.012 --> 00:26:34.332]  Well, they might be illegal, Your Honor.
[00:26:34.352 --> 00:26:35.193]  It's just like, what?
[00:26:36.453 --> 00:26:37.774]  I'll run around with illegal guns.
[00:26:37.814 --> 00:26:38.514]  Woo!
[00:26:38.534 --> 00:26:39.554]  We're in a cult here.
[00:26:40.234 --> 00:26:44.496]  You know, just... It's absolutely insane.
[00:26:44.896 --> 00:26:46.157]  Guns are like seatbelts.
[00:26:46.397 --> 00:26:47.217]  They're to protect us.
[00:26:49.298 --> 00:26:51.158]  I carry my gun, I put my seatbelt on.
[00:26:51.518 --> 00:26:53.039]  It's like I wash my ass every day.
[00:26:53.599 --> 00:26:54.719]  I brush my teeth twice a day.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:01.662]  I mean, you know, it's here in case somebody bad comes.
[00:27:02.898 --> 00:27:03.519]  It's that simple.
[00:27:04.801 --> 00:27:05.742]  Why we have an armored vehicle?
[00:27:05.762 --> 00:27:07.525]  Because we go into antifa and leftist events.
[00:27:07.565 --> 00:27:08.567]  They attack you!
[00:27:08.587 --> 00:27:14.396]  How many times they attack the truck with hammers and, you know, flashbangs.
[00:27:14.476 --> 00:27:15.718]  I mean, you know, this is what goes on.
[00:27:17.108 --> 00:27:19.630]  All right, I want to bring Chase Geiser up because he was there in court yesterday.
[00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.652]  Did a great job covering it with Rob Aguero just to get his take on how epic this is.
[00:27:23.692 --> 00:27:26.834]  I mean, this has really become a huge soap opera, but it's real.
[00:27:27.315 --> 00:27:28.896]  What do you say to those that tried to deny?
[00:27:28.916 --> 00:27:33.219]  Because remember, even the left would say, nobody's trying to take your thing, even though they're filing a court to do it.
[00:27:34.139 --> 00:27:35.380]  The gaslighting is insane.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.002]  Does it ever want the opposition to form?
[00:27:38.482 --> 00:27:40.604]  And then when they're able to shut us down, they go, oh, look, we had a victory.
[00:27:41.653 --> 00:27:48.059]  But instead, we just keep telling the truth and God keeps giving us, like the widows might, a little more runway.
[00:27:48.079 --> 00:27:52.503]  And each time that's taken away, we just trust in God and don't quit, even more runway.
[00:27:52.523 --> 00:27:54.785]  And then we'll fight right to the end of the line, and then more runway.
[00:27:54.805 --> 00:27:56.307]  I mean, this is biblical, Chase.
[00:27:56.567 --> 00:28:01.672]  It's almost like God is really just being entertained by all this, just wanting to see the fight continue.
[00:28:01.992 --> 00:28:04.594]  Well, at least somebody's having fun.
[00:28:05.054 --> 00:28:16.623]  You know, the one thing I noticed about yesterday specifically is it's not every single court date or hearing that we have pertaining to InfoWars or even your personal stuff, Alex, that the press shows up to.
[00:28:16.723 --> 00:28:23.688]  They show up to the ones that they know are going to be really pivotal, really important, and they were frantically there rushing around.
[00:28:23.748 --> 00:28:24.909]  Hold on, hold on, that's key.
[00:28:25.229 --> 00:28:27.431]  They show up and they get the order to and they're given the script.
[00:28:27.691 --> 00:28:28.252]  Yes, exactly.
[00:28:28.292 --> 00:28:29.533]  That's the corporate media against the order.
[00:28:29.993 --> 00:28:31.895]  It's either zero or it's hundreds.
[00:28:32.075 --> 00:28:33.196]  Sorry, go ahead, that's Keith.
[00:28:33.276 --> 00:28:38.000]  Exactly, and so that's how we knew that yesterday was actually a really pivotal moment in this trial.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:48.589]  I mean, we obviously knew internally for weeks that this was an important day, but that's the evidence, that's all the evidence the public should need that this was a really important court date, was the amount of press that was there pushing for this.
[00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:50.811]  And yes, I mean, I sat in the hearing for hours.
[00:28:53.308 --> 00:28:56.910]  Blazingly boring for some parts and then riveting for other parts.
[00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:02.834]  And we were on the edge of our seats at the end as Judge Lopez spoke for, gosh, it must have been 20 or 30 minutes.
[00:29:02.874 --> 00:29:05.876]  He gave a really epic kind of closing speech.
[00:29:05.936 --> 00:29:11.660]  It was something that you would think would be, you know, out of To Kill a Mockingbird or something almost at the end.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.481]  And we didn't know what he was going to do.
[00:29:13.521 --> 00:29:22.746]  I mean, we thought that he was probably going to dismiss because he said something about that, you know, a month ago at the end of May in the court hearing, but we didn't know because he's a reasonable guy and it was a very complicated case.
[00:29:23.106 --> 00:29:28.309]  So we didn't know what a reasonable person would decide in such a complicated problem, but ultimately he made the right decision, I think.
[00:29:28.569 --> 00:29:38.975]  And yes, it does seem like God is, you know, throwing us a loaf every once in a while, or it's like manna from heaven where we have just what we need for the day in order to get to the next day.
[00:29:39.415 --> 00:29:43.520]  You were only in there part of the time, but you saw some of the times where the judge would go, you never ran InfoWars, McGill.
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:44.021]  Jones is the boss.
[00:29:44.121 --> 00:29:51.121]  It's a pivotal moment in Infowars history and I'm glad that we're going to be able to stay on the air for the next several months at least.
[00:29:51.121 --> 00:29:58.121]  You were only in there part of the time, but you saw some of the times where the judge would go, "You never ran Infowars, McGill. Jones is the boss." And McGill would go, "I am the boss."
[00:29:58.121 --> 00:30:11.121]  Yes. There was explicitly a moment in the end where he mentioned, you know, there's dispute over whether or not Alex Jones can control this company after it's dismissed, but he never lost control to begin with.
[00:29:58.362 --> 00:30:10.674]  Yes, there was explicitly a moment in the end where he mentioned, you know, there's dispute over whether or not Alex Jones can control this company after it's dismissed, but he never lost control to begin with.
[00:30:10.814 --> 00:30:12.195]  That was the way he kind of framed it.
[00:30:12.656 --> 00:30:23.386]  That Jones was always in control of this company and any move to make you not in control of this company was either an effort to deceive the public or to deceive the team internally as well.
[00:30:23.866 --> 00:30:26.209]  And so, you know, you're still in control.
[00:30:26.329 --> 00:30:26.829]  You're still CEO.
[00:30:26.849 --> 00:30:32.355]  Yes, there's a trustee thing here and the news is going to report it like, oh, Alex Jones doesn't own InfoWars anymore.
[00:30:32.375 --> 00:30:36.119]  And the public's just going to read that as you've totally lost control and this has been some major defeat.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.343]  But this is how we stay on air for the next several months.
[00:30:39.603 --> 00:30:43.167]  This is how you actually maintain managerial control of this company, which is key.
[00:30:43.427 --> 00:30:52.838]  Well, let's be clear, the judge said there'd have to be a hearing and he said, technically, now that I'm going into this, if I agree, then this is the owner and I will allow it, but I'm in charge.
[00:30:52.858 --> 00:30:54.680]  But I don't want to sit here and crow about this.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.183]  This other guy's very highly respected.
[00:30:57.663 --> 00:31:04.828]   Early on, we couldn't get anybody highly respected in, so we had to kind of take You know, the little slitherers that wanted to come in because nobody would take the CRO job.
[00:31:05.148 --> 00:31:07.508]  Now everybody's like, whoa, you just got like the dude.
[00:31:08.049 --> 00:31:10.169]  So, so very serious professional.
[00:31:10.589 --> 00:31:12.109]  And so these people aren't going to play games.
[00:31:12.129 --> 00:31:13.870]  They're like, no, you've been managing great.
[00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:16.190]  We'll bring in some, you know, you already got financial people.
[00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:17.591]  We'll sit there and monitor it.
[00:31:17.631 --> 00:31:21.871]  So just go and then we'll make decisions and move forward along those lines.
[00:31:21.931 --> 00:31:26.733]  But again, it's just so epic to be in the middle of this and watch this.
[00:31:26.853 --> 00:31:28.233]  And you've been here.
[00:31:29.213 --> 00:31:40.473]  When this guy's going around degrading me and saying I'm an idiot and saying he's the boss, and just to watch the arrogance or the chutzpah where he would at least 10 times say, no, I'm in control.
[00:31:40.854 --> 00:31:42.016]  And they just kept saying, no, you're not.
[00:31:42.677 --> 00:31:48.001]  Well, my lawyers got up and said, here's the law and here's your engagement letter, Mr. McGill.
[00:31:48.081 --> 00:31:49.102]  Show us where it says that.
[00:31:49.142 --> 00:31:50.063]  He says, I can't show you.
[00:31:50.423 --> 00:31:52.365]  Yes, he said, I just think that I'm in charge.
[00:31:52.385 --> 00:31:53.946]  It doesn't say that in the engagement letter.
[00:31:54.126 --> 00:31:56.928]  There's no paperwork or documentation to suggest that I'm in charge.
[00:31:57.929 --> 00:31:58.990]  I just think that I am.
[00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:03.313]  That was basically his testimony and Lopez just didn't fall for it.
[00:32:04.494 --> 00:32:06.675]  You know, the fascinating thing... That's what McGill does.
[00:32:06.695 --> 00:32:19.377]  Remember when I recorded that thing where he calls me up, he filed a secret filing saying I was stealing money and incompetent and evil and he should take control of the company, and the judge didn't keep it secret, sent it to me, and I call McGill up, he calls back, and he goes, Alex, I never recorded you.
[00:32:20.478 --> 00:32:21.238]  That's a lie.
[00:32:21.258 --> 00:32:22.198]  Your lawyers are lying.
[00:32:22.218 --> 00:32:22.878]  That's fake.
[00:32:23.298 --> 00:32:24.378]  And then he's doing it to the judge.
[00:32:24.578 --> 00:32:25.979]  The judge is like, you're not in control of this company.
[00:32:25.999 --> 00:32:26.619]  He goes, yes I am.
[00:32:27.648 --> 00:32:30.789]  I mean, what type of... I'm not even trying to run this guy down.
[00:32:30.869 --> 00:32:33.150]  It's like, what is up with these leftists, man?
[00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:33.951]  They're weird.
[00:32:34.271 --> 00:32:35.531]  Like, two men can have a baby?
[00:32:35.592 --> 00:32:36.832]  It's insane stuff.
[00:32:36.872 --> 00:32:38.453]  It's like, what is their problem?
[00:32:39.433 --> 00:32:42.294]  Yeah, I honestly just don't understand it.
[00:32:42.615 --> 00:32:48.677]  It's one of those things that I observe but do not understand because it's so against my grain.
[00:32:48.737 --> 00:32:56.020]   It's so counterintuitive to how I operate, to how the good people I grew up around operate, to how my family operates, to how Let's talk about those.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.501]  Let's just get this all on record because there's a lot of this.
[00:32:59.621 --> 00:33:00.581]  I'm going to bring all this out.
[00:33:00.601 --> 00:33:06.701]   power trip that they would want to control and intentionally sabotage someone else's company.
[00:33:06.701 --> 00:33:12.521]   And some of the decisions that have been made over the last few months that were totally outside of our control, you know, were just mind-blowing.
[00:33:12.521 --> 00:33:14.521]  So I'm just so glad that we're moving on to the next stage.
[00:33:14.521 --> 00:33:15.521]  Well, let's talk about those.
[00:33:15.521 --> 00:33:17.361]  Let's just get this all on record because there's a lot of this.
[00:33:17.361 --> 00:33:18.481]  I'm going to bring all this out.
[00:33:18.481 --> 00:33:20.081]  I'm not going to hide stuff.
[00:33:19.986 --> 00:33:22.909]  You're a great IT guy, and that's why I brought you in, not just on air.
[00:33:23.329 --> 00:33:25.291]  You've innovated so much stuff, all the great stuff.
[00:33:25.832 --> 00:33:31.197]  We have a deal with Rumble that would save us millions of dollars a year where we just stream their stuff.
[00:33:31.237 --> 00:33:33.099]  We use their streaming service instead of our own servers.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:33.560]  Yes.
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.602]  What did McGill do to that?
[00:33:35.762 --> 00:33:41.023]  So what happened was, after we got banned everywhere, we created Banned.Video.
[00:33:41.424 --> 00:33:49.266]  And we got our own servers, and we host all of our own videos, and we host all of our own live streams at InfoWars.com forward slash show at Banned.Video.
[00:33:49.406 --> 00:33:50.866]  And the cost has been killing us!
[00:33:50.886 --> 00:33:56.648]  It costs at least $2.17 every single minute that our website is live.
[00:33:57.088 --> 00:33:59.870]  So it adds up to over six figures every single month.
[00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:07.636]  And I just simply came in and suggested, why don't we back up all of Band.Video with our Rumble account, because the hosting's free on Rumble.
[00:34:07.936 --> 00:34:15.642]  Why don't we stream from Rumble and we could stream out in 1080 quality instead of 720 quality, which we're doing now to save money because we serve all the streams ourselves.
[00:34:15.943 --> 00:34:22.508]  Why don't we just host everything on Rumble, get some sort of a contractual agreement with the CEO of Rumble that says they're never going to censor us if you're worried about that.
[00:34:22.528 --> 00:34:24.529]  He's not going to do it anyway, but we could get it in writing.
[00:34:24.569 --> 00:34:26.771]  We're big enough that they would love the attention.
[00:34:27.572 --> 00:34:32.337]  Let's just do that and eliminate the six-figure cost every month and hosting our own videos.
[00:34:32.377 --> 00:34:33.798]  And they just said, no, it's a bad idea.
[00:34:33.978 --> 00:34:34.679]  And they just wouldn't do it.
[00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:35.520]  And I tried so hard.
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.422]  I mean, I pushed like a mother to get that done.
[00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:38.723]  I know, and I've talked to the head of Rumble.
[00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:40.025]  They already wanted to do all that with us.
[00:34:40.625 --> 00:34:45.330]  I said, I'm in control, but I can't get these people to do anything I say because they say they're in control.
[00:34:46.271 --> 00:34:46.811]  That's one thing.
[00:34:46.831 --> 00:34:47.632]  That's one example.
[00:34:47.712 --> 00:34:51.295]  And that results in millions of dollars for us over the course of a couple of years.
[00:34:51.355 --> 00:34:55.158]  And those kinds of business decisions would get you fired in any private sector business.
[00:34:55.418 --> 00:35:01.423]  But since this is like being taken over by the state, this was the type of stuff that internally we had to fight against.
[00:35:01.463 --> 00:35:04.345]  We had to fight against the empire at the gates of Hoth.
[00:35:05.386 --> 00:35:05.846]  Absolutely.
[00:35:05.906 --> 00:35:09.529]  In closing, because Kirk Elliott's coming on with us in a moment, and I got to him late and I apologize.
[00:35:09.989 --> 00:35:14.373]  Then we've got Daniel Esselin coming up to talk about so many huge topics.
[00:35:15.752 --> 00:35:16.873]  Any other big takeaways?
[00:35:16.913 --> 00:35:19.334]  Because we need to put together a video to show how big the media was.
[00:35:20.374 --> 00:35:21.595]  You see a shot of cameras around me.
[00:35:21.615 --> 00:35:23.135]  It was like a point to a hundred cameras.
[00:35:23.836 --> 00:35:35.841]  And again, somebody snaps their fingers and the same script goes out, the same message, and to see the corporate media now spin everything, that this was a defeat for us when it was the opposite.
[00:35:36.081 --> 00:35:39.402]  There's a couple of observations about this specifically that I think are interesting.
[00:35:39.462 --> 00:35:43.729]   First thing is, Yes, that lunatic did come up to you in the restaurant.
[00:35:43.909 --> 00:35:44.690]  That story happened.
[00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:46.952]  I witnessed it where he, you know, told you to go kill yourself.
[00:35:46.972 --> 00:35:50.815]  But that was like the 1 out of 10 interactions we would have.
[00:35:51.155 --> 00:36:00.502]  For every person like that, there are 9 or 10 or 15 other people that were driving by, honking, rolling down their windows, saying, good luck Alex Jones, screaming, we love Alex Jones.
[00:36:00.802 --> 00:36:05.026]  There were construction workers walking past, robbing myself, saying, I love Alex Jones, you know.
[00:36:05.526 --> 00:36:06.886]  Oh yeah, what's he about?
[00:36:06.906 --> 00:36:08.467]  I mean, everybody was talking about you.
[00:36:08.487 --> 00:36:10.467]  90% of it was positive.
[00:36:10.768 --> 00:36:20.871]  We had people that ran several blocks to come and meet just me and Rob because they saw that we were standing outside reporting into the American Journal or to Bannon's War Room.
[00:36:21.391 --> 00:36:25.632]  And they were just fans that, like, wanted to meet us and, you know, ask how Alex was doing and ask about you.
[00:36:25.692 --> 00:36:28.593]  So the amount of support for you was astounding.
[00:36:28.633 --> 00:36:31.114]  But I'm not saying that just to kiss your ass or stroke your ego or anything.
[00:36:31.274 --> 00:36:33.454]   No, it shows how popular Freedom is, to be clear.
[00:36:33.554 --> 00:36:38.496]  The camera crews, Alex, of the opposition media, the cameramen loved you.
[00:36:38.836 --> 00:36:46.058]  So even the guys that are filming you for these outlets that are going to write hit pieces about you, we're smiling as you're pointing into the camera, you're making them laugh.
[00:36:46.118 --> 00:36:47.459]  I mean, everybody likes you.
[00:36:47.479 --> 00:36:49.559]  It's just some top-down narrative.
[00:36:49.579 --> 00:36:53.920]  They're all just following orders in order to sabotage you as best they can.
[00:36:54.301 --> 00:36:55.181]  And again, it's not about me.
[00:36:55.241 --> 00:36:56.581]  I'm just a focal point, exactly.
[00:36:56.601 --> 00:36:57.862]  It's not about Trump.
[00:36:57.882 --> 00:36:58.482]  It's a focal point.
[00:36:59.082 --> 00:37:03.445]  And I would just disagree and say, it's been about three months since somebody said, I want you to die.
[00:37:03.805 --> 00:37:06.967]  And I've said on air to listeners, they come up and they say, it'll be a woman and a man.
[00:37:06.987 --> 00:37:08.328]  They'll say, are you Alex Jones?
[00:37:08.348 --> 00:37:08.848]  It's always the same.
[00:37:08.868 --> 00:37:09.309]  And I'll say, yes.
[00:37:09.329 --> 00:37:10.329]  And they go, F your family.
[00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:11.190]  I hope your kids die.
[00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:12.070]  I hope you kill yourself.
[00:37:12.531 --> 00:37:18.955]  And you saw the guy while in the line was a federal marshal at the restaurant, little cafeteria by the courthouse.
[00:37:19.415 --> 00:37:22.597]  That would be a federal marshal right there with his gun and his thing waiting behind us to eat.
[00:37:22.917 --> 00:37:25.679]  The guy walks right up, looks like an antifa meth head.
[00:37:25.939 --> 00:37:26.139]  Yeah.
[00:37:26.279 --> 00:37:30.222]  Are you Alex Jones that says, I hope you effing kill yourself, die, and then runs off?
[00:37:30.462 --> 00:37:30.662]  Yeah.
[00:37:30.842 --> 00:37:32.903]  But it's not 90% positive.
[00:37:33.343 --> 00:37:35.305]  There was one negative interaction.
[00:37:35.385 --> 00:37:38.727]  Almost all the federal marshals in the courthouse shook my hand, said, keep it up.
[00:37:38.987 --> 00:37:40.087]  We know this is all BS.
[00:37:40.388 --> 00:37:41.248]  And I was like, oh, yeah.
[00:37:41.708 --> 00:37:42.469]  They made this up.
[00:37:42.509 --> 00:37:43.349]  I never said any of this.
[00:37:43.369 --> 00:37:44.010]  So they go, we know.
[00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:44.850]  We've been following it.
[00:37:45.371 --> 00:37:46.991]  So they were super awake.
[00:37:47.092 --> 00:37:50.594]  But they were also outside the building and on top of the building and stuff.
[00:37:50.614 --> 00:37:54.096]  I think there was some threats or something going on because they were really agitated.
[00:37:54.855 --> 00:37:55.955]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:37:56.195 --> 00:37:56.735]  And you're right.
[00:37:56.836 --> 00:37:58.916]  It was probably more like 99.9% positive.
[00:37:58.936 --> 00:38:00.236]  That was the only negative interaction we had.
[00:38:00.276 --> 00:38:01.577]  Everything else was positive the other day.
[00:38:01.597 --> 00:38:02.937]  But people are waking up.
[00:38:03.337 --> 00:38:05.038]  This isn't going to land.
[00:38:05.058 --> 00:38:07.198]  They're not going to be able to continue to lie in the way that they have.
[00:38:07.358 --> 00:38:09.459]  There's a small leak in their censorship ship.
[00:38:10.099 --> 00:38:19.441]  And now that freedom of speech is being protected on X, for example, there's just nothing they can do to keep the truth from propagating across the entire planet.
[00:38:19.741 --> 00:38:23.082]  And they know it, and they're screwed, and they're acting desperate in response to this.
[00:38:23.899 --> 00:38:33.862]  Well I appreciate you and Rob Aguero's doing a great job and I love you and I love the whole crew and I cannot thank the listeners and viewers enough, our supporters, our sponsors, and just everybody.
[00:38:33.902 --> 00:38:36.803]  This is a fight and that's why it keeps going and going and going.
[00:38:37.143 --> 00:38:39.064]  It's about who wants it most.
[00:38:39.084 --> 00:38:41.205]  This is not a sprint, this is a marathon.
[00:38:41.465 --> 00:38:42.765]  Chase, how do people follow you on X?
[00:38:43.045 --> 00:38:47.107]  Just at realchasegeyser or follow at realalexjones as always of course.
[00:38:47.127 --> 00:38:47.747]  You'll see me around.
[00:38:48.615 --> 00:38:49.595]  Thank you, as long as we're here.
[00:38:49.635 --> 00:38:50.576]  That's up to you, folks.
[00:38:50.976 --> 00:38:53.196]  All right, Dr. Kirk Elliott, I got my time screwed up.
[00:38:53.256 --> 00:38:54.637]  Sorry, I made him wait 30 minutes.
[00:38:54.677 --> 00:38:55.257]  I apologize.
[00:38:55.637 --> 00:38:58.058]  He's not just a wonderful sponsor and the reason we're still on air.
[00:38:58.078 --> 00:38:59.238]  Without him, we wouldn't be here.
[00:38:59.778 --> 00:39:03.079]  He's also the top silver broker slash gold in the United States.
[00:39:03.099 --> 00:39:04.399]  I'm going to bring that stack of articles.
[00:39:04.419 --> 00:39:04.719]  Thank you.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.080]  And we just really love him and we really appreciate him.
[00:39:08.481 --> 00:39:16.563]  And he sent us this giant stack of news and analysis on the economy we're going to hit in the next 50 minutes or so ahead of Daniel Estelin joining us.
[00:39:17.483 --> 00:39:22.747]  And then I'm going to offer Daniel, after I interview him some, to let him host because he can go for hours.
[00:39:22.887 --> 00:39:25.369]  I've got to go get on an airplane to a secret mission.
[00:39:25.729 --> 00:39:28.291]  You'll see on national TV in the next 24 hours.
[00:39:29.211 --> 00:39:30.192]  So I'll just leave it at that.
[00:39:30.212 --> 00:39:33.214]  A lot of exciting things going on.
[00:39:33.234 --> 00:39:34.695]  A lot of exciting things unfolding.
[00:39:35.135 --> 00:39:39.635]  We've got these stock market crashes in Russia.
[00:39:39.635 --> 00:39:43.355]  We've got Saudi Arabia leaving with dollar.
[00:39:43.355 --> 00:39:45.115]  I mean, this is everything Kirk's been talking about.
[00:39:45.115 --> 00:39:47.076]  He's a top economist and a great patriot.
[00:39:47.076 --> 00:39:50.615]  Find him at kepm.com/gold.
[00:39:50.615 --> 00:39:53.596]   If you want to get good gold and silver and none of the runaround and none of the games
[00:39:53.596 --> 00:39:56.795]   and just pure service and the best deal you're going to find, that's why they're the biggest company,
[00:39:56.795 --> 00:40:01.355]   25 years in operation, an overnight success, a 25 year overnight success.
[00:40:01.355 --> 00:40:03.875]  It's quality, they're the guys to go with.
[00:40:03.875 --> 00:40:05.195]  They're a great sponsor.
[00:40:05.195 --> 00:40:09.436]   I wanted to get that up front, but regardless, before we hit all this economic news,
[00:40:09.436 --> 00:40:11.315]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, you've been behind the scenes.
[00:40:11.315 --> 00:40:13.536]  I've confided in you, gotten your advice.
[00:40:13.536 --> 00:40:15.436]  I've told you stuff behind the scenes.
[00:40:15.543 --> 00:40:19.504]  I don't know how much you've had time to follow what happened the last 24 hours, but total vindication.
[00:40:19.584 --> 00:40:20.704]  Yes, they wanted to shut us down.
[00:40:21.024 --> 00:40:23.625]  Yes, they tried to lock us out without judge's orders.
[00:40:23.965 --> 00:40:30.386]  Yes, not the court himself, but the people in the court system of how bankruptcy worked.
[00:40:30.486 --> 00:40:35.567]  A group of leftists literally tried a palace coup here out of pure insanity.
[00:40:35.687 --> 00:40:36.987]  I mean, it's so reckless.
[00:40:37.007 --> 00:40:37.827]  It's so bold.
[00:40:38.187 --> 00:40:39.167]  I can't believe they even tried it.
[00:40:39.648 --> 00:40:40.748]  You knew the inside baseball.
[00:40:40.768 --> 00:40:41.748]  What is it like to see this now?
[00:40:43.237 --> 00:40:46.300]  Well, to me, it's an answer to prayer, right?
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:47.922]  It just proves that prayer works.
[00:40:47.982 --> 00:40:57.953]  It proves that it's impossible, Alex, for dark to stay dark if there's even just a little flicker of light, right?
[00:40:58.373 --> 00:41:13.400]   So now this light is casting out the darkness, and I view this as a huge monumental shift for you, for free speech, for freedom, as America's got to start seeing this massive
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:20.840]   government overreach, and we're seeing these little wins and these victories, and for you it's just a massive victory.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:28.480]   Even though the left is going to say, "Oh, you did lose everything," it's the turning of the page for the next chapter.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:35.690]   That's how I view it, and I have been privy to some of the inside baseball after some You know, I have been privy to some of the inside baseball after, you know, some of our conversations.
[00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:39.471]  And to me, this is absolute proof, Alex.
[00:41:40.111 --> 00:41:42.791]  Absolute proof that God is in charge.
[00:41:43.311 --> 00:41:46.752]  And when he's in charge, what does his word tell us?
[00:41:47.032 --> 00:41:48.952]  Every knee must bow to him.
[00:41:49.333 --> 00:41:53.233]  The knee of sickness, the knee of disease, this knee of evil, all this onslaught.
[00:41:53.553 --> 00:41:55.334]  They all have to bow to him, right?
[00:41:55.374 --> 00:41:57.114]  And you were here two weeks ago.
[00:41:57.794 --> 00:42:05.235]  You were here two weeks ago, you and your CEO, we all had a prayer to protect InfoWars, to have truth, to have the right thing happen, and I'd forgot about that.
[00:42:05.275 --> 00:42:05.896]  Thank you so much.
[00:42:06.316 --> 00:42:17.038]  Will you lead us in a prayer, because you're also a theologian with a degree in that, and have been involved with the biggest conservative Christian organizations in America, like Focus on the Family, on its board, people that didn't know.
[00:42:17.478 --> 00:42:18.538]  You're a respected theologian.
[00:42:18.898 --> 00:42:22.159]  Please lead us in a prayer, not just for me, but for Trump and America and the world.
[00:42:23.659 --> 00:42:24.239]  Absolutely.
[00:42:25.359 --> 00:42:27.782]  Dear Lord, we are so thankful for your provision.
[00:42:27.842 --> 00:42:29.645]  We're thankful for your protection.
[00:42:30.185 --> 00:42:38.196]  We're thankful that when we open up our hearts and our minds and our ears to hear from you, that you speak, you're constantly speaking.
[00:42:38.917 --> 00:42:45.224]   And when we listen to that and we have the courage to act on that, We can change the world.
[00:42:45.284 --> 00:42:47.565]  So I just pray for Alex right now.
[00:42:47.605 --> 00:42:49.686]  I pray for President Trump.
[00:42:49.746 --> 00:42:55.048]  I pray for our country that the plans of the enemy will be shaken.
[00:42:55.068 --> 00:42:58.890]  I just thank you and exposed and destroyed.
[00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:08.967]   And I thank you Lord that there is no Enemy that can enter your tent, so to speak, with your divine protection and your provision.
[00:43:09.127 --> 00:43:15.671]  I just pray for a special anointing for Alex as he continues to speak truth.
[00:43:16.252 --> 00:43:21.455]  I just pray for your Holy Spirit to just guide every step, every word.
[00:43:21.875 --> 00:43:28.440]  Pray that his heart and mind would be open to you and he would continue to have the courage to speak truth because our country needs that.
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:38.499]   Our country needs what President Trump is bringing to the table, and as the lies are exposed, truth will prevail.
[00:43:38.919 --> 00:43:48.381]  And I just thank you that our latter years are going to be better than our former, and I'm excited about what's to come, because you, Lord, are in charge.
[00:43:48.641 --> 00:43:49.741]  In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:43:50.122 --> 00:43:50.462]  Amen.
[00:43:50.502 --> 00:43:52.182]  Thank you so much, Dr. Elliott.
[00:43:52.742 --> 00:43:54.722]  All right, you've sent me so much stuff, as usual.
[00:43:54.742 --> 00:43:57.943]  We've talked for two hours about one story here.
[00:43:58.183 --> 00:44:01.924]  Where do you want to start with the huge developments that you were on two weeks ago that you predicted?
[00:44:03.295 --> 00:44:16.999]  I think what we should start with is Saudi Arabia, which is, to me, this petrodollar in Saudi Arabia is the biggest economic news of our lifetime, Alex.
[00:44:17.099 --> 00:44:18.479]  And here's why I say that.
[00:44:18.599 --> 00:44:27.682]  So when you look back, and let's take a little walk back in history, we used to have a currency that was backed by gold prior to the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.
[00:44:29.682 --> 00:44:34.105]  You know, one ounce of gold equaled $20 and people could go to the store and spend it and everything else.
[00:44:34.145 --> 00:44:38.728]  And then the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 changed that.
[00:44:39.089 --> 00:44:40.950]  It changed everything, kind of.
[00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:46.173]  But still, you could have international settlements between countries.
[00:44:46.213 --> 00:44:47.594]  They could settle in gold.
[00:44:47.914 --> 00:44:51.377]  Just we as citizens couldn't buy or sell with it anymore.
[00:44:51.897 --> 00:45:06.573]  So that went on until the early 1970s when Nixon closed the gold window because France wanted repayment of a loan in gold and Nixon said, go pound sand, we'll pay you in dollars, we're going to close this gold window, right?
[00:45:06.653 --> 00:45:13.120]  So people say, Kirk, we've been on this fiat money system for such a long time and it's why we have so much debt.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:13.680]  It's like, no.
[00:45:14.481 --> 00:45:24.564]  I don't think that we have been on a completely based fiat money system, which means money printed out of thin air by decree, until June 9th.
[00:45:24.944 --> 00:45:26.504]  Because think about this, Alex.
[00:45:26.644 --> 00:45:30.025]  Prior to 1913, we had a gold-backed currency.
[00:45:30.445 --> 00:45:35.867]  Then we had a quasi-gold-backed currency because we could still do international settlements with gold.
[00:45:36.367 --> 00:45:39.048]  Then in 1973, Kissinger put together the petrodollar.
[00:45:43.709 --> 00:45:44.229]  Right.
[00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:45.891]  So what did Kissinger do?
[00:45:45.931 --> 00:45:53.236]  He basically told Saudi Arabia, it's like, hey, all of the oil that you're selling all over the world, we want you to use the U.S.
[00:45:53.296 --> 00:45:53.656]  dollar.
[00:45:53.756 --> 00:45:56.698]  In exchange for that, we will give you military protection.
[00:45:57.399 --> 00:46:03.303]  And that spread to a lot of the other OPEC producing nations in the Middle East and therefore the petrodollar.
[00:46:03.363 --> 00:46:10.608]   So if you think about it, We went from gold-backed to quasi-gold-backed, then to oil-backed currency.
[00:46:10.948 --> 00:46:23.056]  We've always had some kind of backing to our currency that allowed us to amass tens of trillions of dollars to this day, over $34 trillion worth of debt, and people still wanted our currency.
[00:46:23.436 --> 00:46:32.682]  And the Middle East has got to be just exploding in anger because it's their oil sales that are used by using U.S.
[00:46:32.722 --> 00:46:33.002]  dollars.
[00:46:33.163 --> 00:46:35.224]  They funded our national debt.
[00:46:35.664 --> 00:46:39.825]  Really, that's how, for all intents and purposes, they've funded our national debt.
[00:46:40.085 --> 00:46:51.008]  So now, June 9th, just a few days ago, Saudi Arabia, this 50-year agreement from Kissinger, came up to basically, it's going to die, right?
[00:46:51.048 --> 00:46:51.728]  And what did they do?
[00:46:51.788 --> 00:46:53.208]  They didn't extend it.
[00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:54.749]  They said, no more U.S.
[00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:55.789]  dollars for oil.
[00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:57.129]  And this is so seismic.
[00:46:57.149 --> 00:46:59.490]  This has been talked about for decades, and this never happened.
[00:47:00.031 --> 00:47:00.852]  I mean, the U.S.
[00:47:00.872 --> 00:47:04.296]  has gone to war with Iraq and Libya just for talking about going to gold.
[00:47:04.617 --> 00:47:05.017]  There it is.
[00:47:05.057 --> 00:47:08.442]  Saudi Arabia joins BIS and China-led Central Bank Digital Currency.
[00:47:08.462 --> 00:47:09.884]  It's the one you guys put on earlier.
[00:47:10.324 --> 00:47:14.210]  Saudi Arabia now announces that they're moving away from the dollar into the BRICS.
[00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:16.313]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:19.731]  It is huge, Alex.
[00:47:19.771 --> 00:47:30.422]  I mean, truly a tectonic shift of power from the West, from the New York, London-based financial system, to the East, to Beijing, right?
[00:47:30.482 --> 00:47:39.630]   So, to me, this is why this is the biggest news ever because now When Congress, over the decades, has basically had all these spending bills, right?
[00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:50.578]  It's like, well, we have to fund this defense expenditure, education, or infrastructure, or stimulus money, or we have to raise the debt ceiling, for crying out loud, we kept spending more than what we bring in.
[00:47:51.338 --> 00:47:52.639]  They could do it easily.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:59.624]  Because no matter how much money we printed, there's built-in demand for our currency because of the petrodollar.
[00:48:00.065 --> 00:48:01.466]  Alex, that died.
[00:48:02.122 --> 00:48:03.864]  That died on June 9th.
[00:48:03.924 --> 00:48:07.568]  And so now we are no longer the reserve currency of the world.
[00:48:07.608 --> 00:48:08.989]  This is why this is so big.
[00:48:09.469 --> 00:48:12.753]  And you think, when did we become the world's reserve currency?
[00:48:14.114 --> 00:48:17.858]  1944 with the Bretton Woods Act that was put on steroids with the petrodollar.
[00:48:18.298 --> 00:48:19.319]  But basically, what was that?
[00:48:19.339 --> 00:48:20.601]  That was like 80 years ago.
[00:48:21.838 --> 00:48:27.900]  Everybody almost alive today has never known an America where we didn't have a reserve currency.
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.000]  We got used to that lifestyle.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.721]  Now China wants that lifestyle, right?
[00:48:32.781 --> 00:48:39.682]  They want what we have and very, very soon they will get what we had, right?
[00:48:40.063 --> 00:48:41.803]  So this is this tectonic shift.
[00:48:41.903 --> 00:48:53.831]   So, you know, I was doing some research, you know, for you, There's stories that I put in here for us to talk about.
[00:48:54.312 --> 00:48:55.032]  You know what, Alex?
[00:48:55.953 --> 00:48:56.354]  Vanished.
[00:48:57.116 --> 00:48:58.798]  I mean, they're gone.
[00:48:59.118 --> 00:49:12.590]  They took off the stories because I don't know why mainstream media is not talking about the most important economic development on global finance in our lifetime.
[00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:15.572]  They're not talking about it, right?
[00:49:15.632 --> 00:49:18.595]  So, and there's nothing there.
[00:49:19.596 --> 00:49:23.219]  I looked, I printed them off and now I go and look and they're gone.
[00:49:23.819 --> 00:49:35.363]  So, so the only one that I can see left, you have a, you know, like the article that you had on the screen, Mises.org, you know, they had an article about how the petrodollar's done.
[00:49:35.943 --> 00:49:40.724]  Most of the other mainstream sources, the story has been wiped off the internet.
[00:49:40.744 --> 00:49:44.645]  And magically, as this happens, suddenly Russia gets hit with economic attack.
[00:49:44.665 --> 00:49:46.246]  We should probably get to some of that as well.
[00:49:47.046 --> 00:49:50.448]  Oh my word, so that's step two, right?
[00:49:51.148 --> 00:49:58.811]  So you've got this big move from Saudi Arabia and who entered into Saudi Arabia yesterday?
[00:49:59.372 --> 00:50:02.213]  The Rothschild banking cartel, right?
[00:50:02.233 --> 00:50:07.315]  So Rothschild wants to open up a bank in Saudi Arabia for the first time.
[00:50:07.375 --> 00:50:09.396]  It's like, oh man, it's going to be a development bank.
[00:50:09.416 --> 00:50:14.098]  They're going to develop all their infrastructure and they got $66 billion worth of financing.
[00:50:14.138 --> 00:50:14.739]  It's like, hmm.
[00:50:15.399 --> 00:50:27.182]  The central bankers of the world, the Rothschild family, is now going into Saudi, which tells me that this actually is a major development because they know where power is going.
[00:50:27.222 --> 00:50:29.923]  They know where the monetary flow is going.
[00:50:29.963 --> 00:50:32.364]  So there's a major shift happening and we've confirmed.
[00:50:32.904 --> 00:50:39.268]  The bunch of links you sent to all these sites, a lot of them mainstream, now say article not found, article gone.
[00:50:39.548 --> 00:50:45.271]  So somebody went around desperately and had enough power with all these big sites to have them take the links down you sent us.
[00:50:45.311 --> 00:50:45.712]  Incredible.
[00:50:46.584 --> 00:50:48.447]  Yeah, it is, it is, it is wild.
[00:50:48.507 --> 00:50:54.835]  And I just, I just put these together over the last two days for it to be really fresh and they're already gone.
[00:50:55.236 --> 00:50:59.521]  So, so now we look at, we look at Russia.
[00:50:59.581 --> 00:51:08.410]   So, so why, why would, Saudi Arabia say, hey, we're going to take the yuan is basically our major currency for oil.
[00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:09.570]  Well, of course they would.
[00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:10.911]  They're part of the BRICS nations.
[00:51:11.392 --> 00:51:17.836]  They want to develop their own economy, which is now about 50% of the population of the world.
[00:51:17.916 --> 00:51:19.317]  It's not a small trading block.
[00:51:19.817 --> 00:51:24.620]  But they have all kinds of countries going into this mix, the BRICS+++.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:30.043]  Within probably a year it's going to be 75-80% of the world's population.
[00:51:30.583 --> 00:51:37.647]  So you look at what's happening with Russia, and so take a little bit of a step back in history with Russia too.
[00:51:38.188 --> 00:51:40.089]  So Putin gets ticked.
[00:51:40.649 --> 00:51:55.202]  Right after the Russia-Ukraine conflict started, because Biden did the nuclear of economic sanctions on Russia, and he said, Russia, we're kicking you out of the SWIFT system, which is what allows banks to actually receive or send wires.
[00:51:55.523 --> 00:51:56.584]  So what did Biden want to do?
[00:51:56.624 --> 00:51:59.687]  He wanted to starve out the Russian population.
[00:52:00.087 --> 00:52:03.110]  No more money coming in, no more money going out, nothing.
[00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:09.912]  So if I were Putin, if I were the president of Russia, I'd be just livid, just hopping mad.
[00:52:10.472 --> 00:52:14.253]  And I would say, hey, I got to feed my people, right?
[00:52:14.293 --> 00:52:15.713]  That's what any good president would do.
[00:52:16.293 --> 00:52:18.394]  So I'm not saying Putin's a good guy.
[00:52:18.434 --> 00:52:20.614]  I'm saying if he's a president, that's what he needs to do.
[00:52:21.034 --> 00:52:24.735]  So he goes to China and talks to Xi and said, hey, we got kicked out of SWIFT.
[00:52:24.815 --> 00:52:25.495]  I said, no worries.
[00:52:25.515 --> 00:52:28.616]  We've got something called CIPS, C-I-P-S, very similar.
[00:52:28.676 --> 00:52:30.376]  And we've got this massive trading bloc.
[00:52:30.516 --> 00:52:30.856]  Join us.
[00:52:30.916 --> 00:52:50.696]   So what Biden did After that was the nuclear of all economic sanctions blew up in his face because that one move really solidified the BRICS nations which had been going on for a while to this really tight marriage between Russia and China and now they're exploding in
[00:52:51.416 --> 00:52:56.416]  in size, in influence, in impact, in wealth, in everything.
[00:52:56.416 --> 00:52:58.856]  And it was because of that one move.
[00:52:58.856 --> 00:53:03.136]  Now, the move got even worse just a few days ago.
[00:53:03.136 --> 00:53:09.697]   So I was looking at this press release from the US Treasury Department and the title.
[00:53:09.697 --> 00:53:11.856]  So this was on June 12th, Alex.
[00:53:08.115 --> 00:53:11.617]  And the title, so this was on June 12th, Alex.
[00:53:11.998 --> 00:53:23.605]  The title is, As Russia completes transition to a full war economy, Treasury takes sweeping aim at foundational financial infrastructure and access to third country support.
[00:53:23.965 --> 00:53:29.368]  So, big long title, but there's one sentence or two sentences in there that are actually really important.
[00:53:29.388 --> 00:53:30.069]  I'm going to read them.
[00:53:30.749 --> 00:53:42.554]  It says today's actions by the Treasury Department, which they put 300 sanctions on Russia and financial institutions that were funding Russia, right?
[00:53:42.594 --> 00:53:47.717]  So today's actions strike at the remaining avenues for international materials and equipment.
[00:53:48.337 --> 00:53:52.119]  Including their reliance on critical supplies from third countries.
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:54:06.008]  We are increasing the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia's war economy and eliminating paths for evasion, diminishing Russia's ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software, IT services.
[00:54:06.649 --> 00:54:13.753]  Every day Russia continues to mortgage its future to sustain its unjust war of choice against Ukraine.
[00:54:13.893 --> 00:54:14.634]  So there you have it.
[00:54:15.174 --> 00:54:21.476]  The US is ticked at Russia because of this war against Ukraine, and they're going to throw another 300 sanctions on Russia.
[00:54:21.516 --> 00:54:32.060]  So, again, if I were Putin, I'd be ticked that some other country is actually taking access away from services and IT and software and everything else, right?
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.701]  So what does he do?
[00:54:34.961 --> 00:54:37.002]  Well, actually, there's one more thing that happened.
[00:54:37.942 --> 00:54:49.087]  Two days ago, at the G7 meeting, they decided, the G7 nation said, wow, boy, we actually froze Russia's assets, $344 billion worth of them when that war started.
[00:54:52.768 --> 00:54:58.971]  And they said, well, instead of just freezing them, hey, Putin, we're taking $50 billion of that out.
[00:54:59.091 --> 00:55:06.575]  We're stealing it from the frozen assets that we froze, and we're going to give it to Ukraine because that battle is expensive for us to fight.
[00:55:06.915 --> 00:55:07.715]  So it's here again.
[00:55:08.095 --> 00:55:09.216]  Putin's got to be livid.
[00:55:09.536 --> 00:55:17.520]  Not only did they actually freeze his assets, now they stole $50 billion and they're giving it to the country that he's at war with.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:20.902]  Right, so here's the ramifications.
[00:55:21.563 --> 00:55:24.565]  Putin is like this, loose cannon right now.
[00:55:25.146 --> 00:55:26.527]  And so what did he do?
[00:55:27.027 --> 00:55:34.053]  He actually basically decided, I'm going to get the dollar out of Russia, now and forever.
[00:55:34.534 --> 00:55:37.236]  Right, so he basically said no more U.S.
[00:55:37.296 --> 00:55:37.636]  dollars.
[00:55:37.676 --> 00:55:43.721]  So this is forcing a major break and it's going to hurt Russia too, but in the end he's made the bet it's going to force the move to Brexit entirely.
[00:55:43.922 --> 00:55:45.383]  So you're saying right now the break's happening?
[00:55:46.604 --> 00:55:47.785]  Yeah, right now.
[00:55:47.905 --> 00:55:50.508]  So it's happening as we speak.
[00:55:50.588 --> 00:55:53.871]  So look at that video that's on the screen.
[00:55:54.352 --> 00:56:03.641]  Those are after Putin said, I'm taking the US dollar and we're not going to allow it to be exchanged on currency exchanges.
[00:56:03.921 --> 00:56:08.025]  We're not going to allow it to be used in financial transactions anymore.
[00:56:08.325 --> 00:56:09.887]  There's lines of people.
[00:56:10.407 --> 00:56:20.291]  For blocks and blocks and blocks, trying to get into the banks in Russia, pull out their money because they think that these economic sanctions are going to destroy the ruble, which they're probably right.
[00:56:20.991 --> 00:56:22.331]  They're absolutely probably right.
[00:56:22.391 --> 00:56:24.692]  But here's Putin's calculated move.
[00:56:24.712 --> 00:56:29.454]  He said, okay, it's more important to me to kill the U.S.
[00:56:29.494 --> 00:56:31.394]  dollar than anything else.
[00:56:31.414 --> 00:56:34.055]  So what happened when he did that?
[00:56:34.596 --> 00:56:37.056]  The Russian stock market down 15% in one day.
[00:56:39.471 --> 00:56:43.433]  Ross Bank, one of the larger banks in Russia, basically closed its doors.
[00:56:43.673 --> 00:56:44.513]  They ran out of money.
[00:56:44.873 --> 00:56:48.275]  People cannot get money out of the banks.
[00:56:48.335 --> 00:56:49.716]  They're running out of capital.
[00:56:50.236 --> 00:56:55.958]  And so what Putin did, and this is where it's, is it calculated?
[00:56:56.378 --> 00:56:57.139]  Is it evil?
[00:56:57.599 --> 00:56:58.479]  Is it smart?
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:05.923]  I don't know, but he's willing to hurt his own people temporarily to destroy the U.S.
[00:57:06.003 --> 00:57:06.383]  dollar.
[00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:16.296]  I mean, what a calculated move that could blow up in his face, or it could make the BRICS nations extremely powerful down the road.
[00:57:16.797 --> 00:57:18.298]  I would say it's the latter.
[00:57:18.938 --> 00:57:21.480]  I think the ruble might get hurt really, really hard.
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:24.582]  The stock market in Russia is going to get hit really, really hard.
[00:57:25.082 --> 00:57:37.233]   But if now, when you couple no more US dollars in Russia with Saudi Arabia's deal of no more US dollars for oil, They just killed the petrodollar.
[00:57:37.593 --> 00:57:38.733]  They killed the U.S.
[00:57:38.773 --> 00:57:45.115]  dollar as the world's reserve currency, and I think that this is going to spread through the rest of the BRICS nations.
[00:57:45.896 --> 00:57:55.839]  And as I continue to look at that, it's like, this is going to be crazy as other banks are now going to start to fail.
[00:57:56.099 --> 00:58:01.721]  And the other big signal, continue, is the Rothschilds and all this other money flooding into Saudi Arabia and Russia.
[00:58:02.122 --> 00:58:03.042]  They're betting on the winner.
[00:58:04.375 --> 00:58:13.282]  They're absolutely betting on the winner and after this whole deal of Saudi Arabia getting rid of the petrodollar, of Putin getting rid of the U.S.
[00:58:13.322 --> 00:58:16.105]  dollar, what did China and Russia now do?
[00:58:16.485 --> 00:58:20.748]  They now control the exchange rate of the U.S.
[00:58:20.788 --> 00:58:22.650]  dollar against the ruble and the yuan.
[00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:25.671]  So people would look at that headline and say, well, so what?
[00:58:25.991 --> 00:58:27.331]  This is huge, right?
[00:58:27.371 --> 00:58:31.113]  Because if they control the exchange rate, they can say the exchange rate for the dollar is nothing.
[00:58:31.333 --> 00:58:32.493]  We don't even want it anymore.
[00:58:32.953 --> 00:58:41.216]  So now with this big trading block, if they weren't 50% of the world's population, they wouldn't have any teeth.
[00:58:41.994 --> 00:58:44.054]  Right earlier you were talking about teeth.
[00:58:44.054 --> 00:58:46.414]  It's like, they do have teeth.
[00:58:46.414 --> 00:58:49.254]  This is how they fight their battle.
[00:58:49.254 --> 00:58:52.334]   If they don't wanna go to a military battle, they don't have to.
[00:58:52.334 --> 00:58:57.534]   They could win a war without ever firing a bullet by doing it economically, right?
[00:58:57.534 --> 00:59:01.294]  With banks and with destroying the US dollar.
[00:59:01.294 --> 00:59:18.094]   So this is why I think these moves that we have seen because now,
[00:58:57.321 --> 00:59:21.797]   Right with with banks and with destroying the US dollar so so this is why I think these moves that we have seen over the last week are the biggest tectonic shifts to the global economy everywhere and very detrimental to the US dollar because now We have to have discretion when we print money.
[00:59:22.177 --> 00:59:25.420]  We can't just willy-nilly pass every spending bill that we want.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:28.883]  We can't just willy-nilly raise the debt ceiling like we have been able to.
[00:59:29.523 --> 00:59:30.344]  So what does that mean?
[00:59:30.524 --> 00:59:31.865]  Possibly austerity measures?
[00:59:32.186 --> 00:59:37.430]   They're going to ultimately continue, I think, Alex, to Print their way out of it.
[00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:56.065]  They're going to have to or else they're going to have a mutiny on their hands because 80% of all revenue coming into America, tax revenue, goes towards Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, women and infant children programs, Social Security, those entitlements and mandatory payments of Social Security.
[00:59:56.526 --> 01:00:03.253]   So if you want to do austerity measures and cut spending, 80% of the spending you're going to have to cut comes from your voters.
[01:00:03.654 --> 01:00:04.975]  They're not going to want to do that.
[01:00:05.316 --> 01:00:09.441]  So therefore, I think the printing is going to ramp up like crazy.
[01:00:09.461 --> 01:00:12.746]  The inflationary pressures are going to persist.
[01:00:13.487 --> 01:00:23.038]   And this is why you and I have talked For months now, Alex, for months, that the Fed and Jerome Powell is caught between a rock and a hard place.
[01:00:23.459 --> 01:00:31.848]  Because they can't raise interest rates too much to slow down inflation because they're already at a point of critical mass and people can't afford to live.
[01:00:31.908 --> 01:00:33.951]  And Powell just came out and said, Biden's wrong.
[01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:35.452]  Inflation is bad.
[01:00:35.512 --> 01:00:36.494]  The economy's in trouble.
[01:00:38.234 --> 01:00:38.514]  Yeah.
[01:00:38.854 --> 01:00:43.757]  I mean, he basically called him out and said, your job numbers are boney baloney.
[01:00:44.777 --> 01:00:46.758]  You're overstating job performance.
[01:00:47.299 --> 01:00:49.580]  And I just saw this report a couple days ago.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.161]  I don't have it in that stack that I gave you this morning.
[01:00:53.181 --> 01:01:10.850]   But if you look at the number of illegals and immigrants who have gotten jobs since 2018, and you look at the number of jobs that Biden says were created since 2018, There isn't any US-born citizens that have gotten jobs since 2018.
[01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:17.072]  The numbers justify illegal immigrants getting jobs and not us.
[01:01:17.112 --> 01:01:20.954]  It's like no wonder people can't afford to feed their families.
[01:01:21.014 --> 01:01:29.397]  No wonder there's so much pressure of families to pay their rent, pay their mortgage, feed their kids, pay for health insurance to survive.
[01:01:30.477 --> 01:01:37.719]  It's an ugly economy and I think it's going to spiral down even worse as these things continue to happen.
[01:01:37.759 --> 01:01:52.924]  I mean, it's hard to look at how great America once was and see how in three and a half short years or so, it's complete erosion of what took hundreds of years to establish and build.
[01:01:53.584 --> 01:02:01.050]  I mean, it happens really quickly when America loses favor globally and our currency loses favor.
[01:02:01.170 --> 01:02:02.031]  No, I totally agree.
[01:02:02.071 --> 01:02:06.715]  So one of the different ways this is going to unfold, because the Soviet Union was dead overnight.
[01:02:07.596 --> 01:02:13.301]  America could die overnight or it could go into spasms and start World War III, which appears to be the road they're going down.
[01:02:15.515 --> 01:02:16.216]  I would think so.
[01:02:16.256 --> 01:02:31.268]  I mean, why in the world would you have nuclear warships off the coast of Miami, you know, came into the port of Havana, now floating around Miami 20 miles offshore, a missing nuclear sub that they can't seem to find.
[01:02:31.288 --> 01:02:34.470]  I mean, this is like the hunt for Red October.
[01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:35.831]  It's like, what are they doing?
[01:02:35.871 --> 01:02:36.792]  What is Putin doing?
[01:02:37.292 --> 01:02:38.834]  He's flexing, I think, Alex.
[01:02:38.874 --> 01:02:41.836]  It's like you could do maneuvers anywhere in the world.
[01:02:41.876 --> 01:02:44.098]  Oh, it's a major, major saber rattling.
[01:02:45.211 --> 01:02:45.491]  Yes!
[01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:48.811]  and they decided, "Yeah, let's do our maneuvers 20 miles off of Miami."
[01:02:48.811 --> 01:02:53.371]   Well, I was- On purpose, on purpose, repeating the Cuban missile crisis.
[01:02:53.371 --> 01:02:54.371]  Yes.
[01:02:54.371 --> 01:03:06.210]   I mean, I was talking to General Flynn yesterday, and he said, "Kirk, those missiles from those ships aren't just going to reach the eastern seaboard, they can reach to Iowa," right?
[01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:08.690]  And we, the military knows this.
[01:03:05.356 --> 01:03:08.620]  Right, and the military knows this.
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.543]  This is why they're wondering what's going on.
[01:03:11.603 --> 01:03:14.145]  Now they've got Canadian warships following them along.
[01:03:14.206 --> 01:03:15.367]  They've got U.S.
[01:03:15.427 --> 01:03:18.630]  warships following this Russian caravan of warships.
[01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:22.154]  This is where the Cuban Missile Crisis took place in the same area.
[01:03:22.174 --> 01:03:24.617]  So Putin picked this area to repeat it again.
[01:03:25.783 --> 01:03:26.884]  So symbolic.
[01:03:27.604 --> 01:03:41.513]  I mean, you've been following this stuff for decades, Alex, and the evil left, right, the evil globalists, they're very symbolic on so many things, on dates, on patterns.
[01:03:42.134 --> 01:03:50.417]   And to me, this is just yet another Basically show of their pattern, how they want to control the world, right?
[01:03:50.457 --> 01:04:02.799]  Well, just like the missile crisis, Kennedy, without being told by Lenitzer, because they do whatever they wanted, Curtis LeMay, Kennedy got mad about this and fired him, put Nike missiles on the border of Russia and Turkey.
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:05.680]  And that's why the Russians did that in the early 60s.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.600]  So they're like, oh, you put missiles on our border?
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.561]  We got missiles on your border.
[01:04:09.621 --> 01:04:09.781]  Yeah.
[01:04:10.538 --> 01:04:12.239]  A hundred percent.
[01:04:12.599 --> 01:04:15.741]  So we look at all of this and what does this do?
[01:04:15.901 --> 01:04:19.704]  And you and I talked about this the last time that we did a show.
[01:04:19.764 --> 01:04:24.887]  It's like, and you had mentioned this to me a long time ago, it's how does evil try to win?
[01:04:25.367 --> 01:04:26.788]  You break the will of the people.
[01:04:26.828 --> 01:04:28.169]  So now people are so scared.
[01:04:28.209 --> 01:04:38.976]   Everybody that calls into my office They're scared silly, but they have hope because they know that there's a solution, but they're afraid of this war and nuclear war and rumors of war.
[01:04:39.316 --> 01:04:42.378]  They're afraid that their money is going to run out.
[01:04:42.698 --> 01:04:44.299]  They're afraid of banks failing.
[01:04:44.599 --> 01:04:46.520]  They're afraid of a new pandemic.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.421]  They're afraid of the food supply going away.
[01:04:48.542 --> 01:04:50.083]  I mean, just fear everywhere.
[01:04:50.103 --> 01:04:59.427]   By the way, in Australia, in the U.S., quietly, They just killed half the chickens in areas of the United States.
[01:04:59.447 --> 01:05:03.848]  They just killed half the chickens in major states using bird flu, a PCR test.
[01:05:03.908 --> 01:05:04.489]  It's all fake.
[01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:09.330]  They're cutting off the infrastructure, the oil, the gas, the water, the fertilizer.
[01:05:10.511 --> 01:05:12.111]  It's the globalists doing that, not Putin.
[01:05:12.131 --> 01:05:16.733]  So why would the West want to suppress its own economy while forcing everybody towards the bricks?
[01:05:16.833 --> 01:05:19.194]  I see a larger hidden hand in all this.
[01:05:20.638 --> 01:05:26.165]  I do too, but what we just talked about with Putin, he's doing the same thing.
[01:05:26.909 --> 01:05:33.113]  Causing, you know, immediate and intermediate harm to his own people to win this battle.
[01:05:33.453 --> 01:05:35.955]  So I think the globalists are doing the same thing.
[01:05:35.995 --> 01:05:43.560]  It's like, hey, let's destroy the will of the people because when people are afraid, they're going to look to the government for answers, right?
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:45.281]  They're going to say, government, you got to fix this.
[01:05:45.381 --> 01:05:47.023]  Please help, you know, fix the banks.
[01:05:47.403 --> 01:05:49.124]  Bring us whatever you can do to fix that.
[01:05:49.144 --> 01:05:52.466]  It's like, I mean, this is like COVID, Alex, was the test.
[01:05:52.506 --> 01:05:54.908]  I mean, this is no news to your viewers.
[01:05:55.367 --> 01:06:02.367]   But that was the test to see how quickly we would bend over as a country and just out of fear give up our freedoms.
[01:06:02.367 --> 01:06:09.927]   So let me ask you this way in summation so now what do you see coming up then let's talk because I'm selling stuff I believe in it's a no-brainer to get silver and gold problems
[01:06:09.927 --> 01:06:18.208]   are so many fly-by-nighters or people rip people off you're the top rated place to go and it's sports broadcast a 360 win we should also tell people where you think silver and
[01:06:17.003 --> 01:06:19.386]  Tell people where you think silver and gold is going in this environment.
[01:06:19.707 --> 01:06:25.795]  I personally, at a gut level, think it goes straight up, but definitely I see paper currencies going straight down, so it's a no-brainer to get silver and gold.
[01:06:27.076 --> 01:06:28.217]  Well, absolutely.
[01:06:28.497 --> 01:06:32.520]  And, you know, gold and silver always act as a safe haven.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.861]  So it's like this.
[01:06:34.281 --> 01:06:37.943]  They're like barometers of political and government distrust.
[01:06:38.404 --> 01:06:42.426]  The more that people distrust the government, the higher gold and silver go.
[01:06:42.887 --> 01:06:50.271]  Like, for example, in the 1980s and 90s, which started with the Reagan policies, which lasted, you know, 20 years.
[01:06:50.312 --> 01:06:55.375]  So a couple presidents after that, Bush followed Reagan's policies, so did Clinton.
[01:06:55.415 --> 01:06:59.297]   When it came to the economy, Gold and silver did absolutely nothing.
[01:06:59.898 --> 01:07:07.642]  I mean, gold went from $250 an ounce in 1983 to $258 an ounce in 2002, right?
[01:07:08.483 --> 01:07:11.204]  So 20 years it went up eight bucks.
[01:07:11.705 --> 01:07:11.965]  Why?
[01:07:12.345 --> 01:07:14.146]  Because the Cold War was over.
[01:07:14.226 --> 01:07:15.807]  The Berlin Wall came down.
[01:07:16.808 --> 01:07:18.869]  Newt Gingrich had the contract with America.
[01:07:18.929 --> 01:07:27.729]   Democrats and Republicans were talking and negotiating and cutting deals and interest rates came down, taxes came down, real estate was booming, the stock
[01:07:27.729 --> 01:07:29.889]  market was booming, bond market was booming.
[01:07:29.889 --> 01:07:33.568]  Everything was fat and happy and therefore gold and silver did nothing.
[01:07:33.568 --> 01:07:37.369]  But now we have the absolute opposite of Reagan policies.
[01:07:37.369 --> 01:07:45.689]   We have the absolute opposite of Trump policies and which were simple, three bullet points, lower taxes, lower interest rates and create jobs.
[01:07:45.689 --> 01:07:47.809]  That's what those two presidents did.
[01:07:48.209 --> 01:07:49.929]  And that's what caused the economy to boom.
[01:07:49.929 --> 01:07:51.889]  But we've got the opposite right now.
[01:07:51.889 --> 01:07:55.969]  And when you have opposite policies, you're going to have an opposite outcome.
[01:07:56.865 --> 01:07:59.187]  And Biden's announced he's going to raise taxes even more.
[01:07:59.207 --> 01:08:06.013]  Yeah, I mean, okay, so he says that he's going to do that.
[01:08:06.394 --> 01:08:08.315]  And what did Trump say like two days ago?
[01:08:08.776 --> 01:08:16.322]  He wants to eliminate income taxes and replace that revenue with tariffs on foreign goods.
[01:08:17.005 --> 01:08:18.686]  It's like a genius, right?
[01:08:18.706 --> 01:08:22.628]  I mean, seriously, this is how the Founding Fathers did it, right?
[01:08:22.668 --> 01:08:25.910]  And so he's just going back to truth and to wisdom.
[01:08:28.271 --> 01:08:34.175]  But the policies of these two presidents, Biden and Trump, are completely opposite.
[01:08:34.235 --> 01:08:37.176]  So that's one reason why gold doesn't go up.
[01:08:37.276 --> 01:08:43.020]  The second reason is the manufacturing demand for silver is off the charts.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:43.960]  Right.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.681]  So solar, electric vehicles, fuel cell technology, everything.
[01:08:48.721 --> 01:08:53.163]  And the global COMEX depositories are running low.
[01:08:53.823 --> 01:09:01.185]  They don't have enough to even keep up with the demand in the most sluggish economy in the last 50 years.
[01:09:01.685 --> 01:09:04.926]  They still can't keep up with the demand for silver.
[01:09:04.986 --> 01:09:23.674]   So I was looking at this chart, Alex, and it's the silver naked short positions are double Really, they're about 275% more than the actual supply of silver at the depositories in physical form.
[01:09:23.774 --> 01:09:25.835]  And we're going to find that.
[01:09:26.135 --> 01:09:27.316]  You sent us a big list of charts.
[01:09:27.336 --> 01:09:29.717]  We'll go to the Kirk Elliott charts on here.
[01:09:30.077 --> 01:09:31.178]  It's on the very bottom.
[01:09:31.318 --> 01:09:33.097]  It's on the very, very bottom.
[01:09:33.097 --> 01:09:39.578]   It's that chart on the very last page of those, that stack of paper I gave you.
[01:09:39.578 --> 01:09:41.538]  So there's just the commitment of traders.
[01:09:41.538 --> 01:09:43.137]  It's like a black and purple chart.
[01:09:43.137 --> 01:09:43.978]  I found it, here it is.
[01:09:43.978 --> 01:09:45.738]  And what it says, okay.
[01:09:45.738 --> 01:09:53.978]   297 million ounces are actually available inventory of silver.
[01:09:53.978 --> 01:09:56.858]  What are the short positions on the commitment of traders?
[01:09:56.858 --> 01:10:00.257]  826 million ounces.
[01:10:00.257 --> 01:10:07.057]   It's like, dang, the number of naked short positions is 2.75 times greater than the actual number
[01:10:07.057 --> 01:10:09.358]  of physical ounces available.
[01:10:09.358 --> 01:10:12.978]  This tells me that there is a short squeeze happening.
[01:10:12.978 --> 01:10:13.818]  Right, there's a short squeeze.
[01:10:13.818 --> 01:10:16.618]   And you talked about this months ago, the Chinese telling people to buy silver.
[01:10:16.618 --> 01:10:17.978]  That was the pressure.
[01:10:17.978 --> 01:10:21.057]  The naked shorter is explaining, and now that's happening.
[01:10:21.057 --> 01:10:27.177]   Yeah, that's starting to happen, and it's going to happen immensely, right?
[01:10:26.979 --> 01:10:29.220]  Because you can't have those kind of numbers.
[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:33.641]  Those short positions have to be covered at some point.
[01:10:34.481 --> 01:10:36.161]  And so that's when they start to cover those.
[01:10:36.261 --> 01:10:43.643]  I mean, there's a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo and jargon behind it, but when they cover those, they have to supply physical silver to the people that want them.
[01:10:43.903 --> 01:10:45.863]  They probably don't want to settle in paper.
[01:10:46.083 --> 01:10:48.064]  They want to settle in physical silver.
[01:10:48.724 --> 01:10:59.276]  So here's where I think you see the price go through the roof, because I'm never concerned, Alex, about silver running out for people to buy, even though it could run out.
[01:10:59.977 --> 01:11:02.700]  Higher prices always shake out inventory, right?
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:12.209]   So if Sony or Tesla needs silver for their batteries or for their LCD TVs, And silver is, let's say, $40 an ounce, and there's none available.
[01:11:12.609 --> 01:11:15.031]  Well, they can't finish their product without it.
[01:11:15.491 --> 01:11:19.353]  The military can't build their torpedoes and missiles without it.
[01:11:19.373 --> 01:11:24.456]  Because each one of those big missiles takes like 11,000 ounces of silver in each one.
[01:11:24.937 --> 01:11:25.997]  So what are they going to do?
[01:11:26.017 --> 01:11:28.419]  They're going to say, all right, silver is $40 an ounce.
[01:11:28.439 --> 01:11:28.879]  We'll offer $60.
[01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:30.160]  Or we'll offer $80.
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:31.300]  We'll offer $100.
[01:11:32.101 --> 01:11:37.324]  We don't care what we offer, because we're just going to pass that excess on to the consumer anyways.
[01:11:37.944 --> 01:11:38.104]  Right.
[01:11:38.164 --> 01:11:45.406]  So this is where you start to see manufacturing demand for silver will cause the price to go through the ceiling.
[01:11:46.066 --> 01:11:46.247]  Right.
[01:11:46.287 --> 01:11:52.588]  And so here's where you and I talked about this this little thing briefly.
[01:11:54.369 --> 01:11:59.271]  Like a few, it was about a month ago, Alex, where I said, you know, let the buyer beware.
[01:11:59.412 --> 01:12:02.413]  Not all gold and silver dealers are the same, right?
[01:12:02.453 --> 01:12:04.374]  There's a lot of shady people out there.
[01:12:04.434 --> 01:12:13.739]  So I went to the CFTC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission website, found the press release that I was referring to when I was talking to you about it.
[01:12:14.379 --> 01:12:32.130]   The CFTC And 30 states, 30 states have teamed up to target precious metals dealers that target seniors and overcharge them on average 300% over spot price for metals.
[01:12:32.610 --> 01:12:34.511]  Well, that's highway robbery, right?
[01:12:34.531 --> 01:12:38.053]  But those are the kind of people and dealers that you see.
[01:12:38.073 --> 01:12:40.015]  You told me about this months ago in private.
[01:12:40.695 --> 01:12:42.976]  The government doesn't care about people fleecing old people.
[01:12:43.096 --> 01:12:47.538]  They want to do it to hurt the gold and silver market or to even try to manipulate it or control it.
[01:12:47.918 --> 01:13:02.783]  That's why people have got to go to a company like you that is respected on record 25 years, the best deals, where it's actual real bullion with your admitted markup of 8% and no resale cost, which is huge, and all the depositories where people should put it or at their house.
[01:13:03.203 --> 01:13:04.104]  You're the place to go.
[01:13:04.184 --> 01:13:05.985]  People need to get their silver and gold now.
[01:13:06.445 --> 01:13:09.526]  Are you ready to talk about the behind-the-scenes stuff and what's really going on?
[01:13:10.677 --> 01:13:11.437]  Well, a little bit.
[01:13:11.477 --> 01:13:14.679]  I mean, this is this is my basically entree into that.
[01:13:14.799 --> 01:13:20.402]  So you've got government regulators that are that are looking to shut down an industry.
[01:13:20.522 --> 01:13:21.743]  And we have to say why.
[01:13:22.223 --> 01:13:23.263]  Why do they want to shut it down?
[01:13:23.303 --> 01:13:28.046]  Because they know that when people go into gold and silver, it's a slap in the face.
[01:13:28.926 --> 01:13:35.388]  Against their monetary system, against their central bank digital currency, against their fiat-based money creation.
[01:13:36.008 --> 01:13:47.971]  So, you go with this feel-good story, and I agree with their targeting of these monster, ugly companies that overcharge seniors by that much.
[01:13:48.031 --> 01:13:49.432]  It's like that's highway robbery.
[01:13:49.932 --> 01:13:51.253]  That's awful, right?
[01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:53.215]  And that they shouldn't be allowed to do that.
[01:13:53.636 --> 01:13:57.880]  And so part of me likes that part that they're doing because we're so different.
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.162]  We don't charge 300% over spot.
[01:14:00.202 --> 01:14:01.002]  That's ridiculous.
[01:14:01.403 --> 01:14:07.989]  It's 8% cost of ownership, 0% when you liquidate, bullion, no rare stuff, no collectible stuff.
[01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:10.952]  So there are states that are now starting tech.
[01:14:10.972 --> 01:14:31.639]   And I've got a list of Of other CFTC documents that are about companies that they're going after that are in lawsuits pending legislation and they want to shut down an industry and they're using the story of they're going to target these companies that rip off seniors, which I love that.
[01:14:31.999 --> 01:14:33.779]  I don't want people to rip off seniors.
[01:14:33.899 --> 01:14:35.800]  I want them to be out of business.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:42.982]  But here's the bigger thing to me is the government regulation is starting to pound on, just like stuff that you've gone through.
[01:14:43.582 --> 01:14:45.722]  They want to attack free speech.
[01:14:45.762 --> 01:14:46.382]  How do you do that?
[01:14:46.442 --> 01:14:48.343]  They go after you, right?
[01:14:48.403 --> 01:14:50.983]  Because you're the biggest proponent of free speech on the planet.
[01:14:51.584 --> 01:14:58.285]  So this is where they start to go after the good and the bad at the same time.
[01:14:58.705 --> 01:15:01.806]  But here's my warning to everybody out there.
[01:15:03.226 --> 01:15:12.735]  When you overpay for your metals like 70 something dollars an ounce for silver, ridiculous, because silver is like $30 an ounce, right?
[01:15:12.755 --> 01:15:23.285]  You shouldn't, you know, even with an 8% cost of ownership, you shouldn't pay more than $36 an ounce for it than with 8% on top of it, but 70 plus dollars an ounce.
[01:15:23.706 --> 01:15:23.866]  Okay.
[01:15:25.094 --> 01:15:26.716]  That is highway robbery.
[01:15:27.056 --> 01:15:33.942]  When those companies potentially get shut down because of this government regulatory onslaught, you bought stuff from them?
[01:15:34.103 --> 01:15:35.084]  How are you going to get rid of them?
[01:15:35.644 --> 01:15:38.587]  What if they're the only company that markets those things?
[01:15:39.107 --> 01:15:39.247]  Right?
[01:15:39.267 --> 01:15:40.449]  So this is my warning.
[01:15:40.509 --> 01:15:41.450]  Let the buyer beware.
[01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:46.734]  This is why since day one of our company, we've only focused on bullion.
[01:15:47.655 --> 01:15:54.779]  100 ounce bars of silver, 10 ounce bars of silver, 1 ounce silver rounds, and on gold, kilo bars or 1 ounce bars, right?
[01:15:54.819 --> 01:15:56.700]  And people take delivery of them.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:59.921]  It's not some kind of a futures transaction.
[01:16:00.021 --> 01:16:01.082]  It's not- It's real simple.
[01:16:01.122 --> 01:16:12.668]  You can look at the price of silver or gold spot, call up under Kirk Elliott or his great crew, lock it in, pay your 8% because they got to operate and give you advice, and then when you're ready to sell it back, they will buy it.
[01:16:13.328 --> 01:16:15.430]  For zero commission.
[01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:17.151]  You cannot beat that deal.
[01:16:17.351 --> 01:16:18.572]  That's why you guys are so respected.
[01:16:18.872 --> 01:16:28.179]  People need to call you 720-605-3900, 720-605-3900 or KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:16:28.199 --> 01:16:34.083]  And when you go to the slash gold, they know that that's for my show and they help sponsor us and they are key to us being able to operate.
[01:16:34.123 --> 01:16:35.084]  This is a win-win.
[01:16:35.464 --> 01:16:36.245]  It's such a blessing.
[01:16:36.265 --> 01:16:37.926]  I haven't had a good gold sponsor in over 10 years.
[01:16:38.486 --> 01:16:40.207]  Because literally all the others were fly-by-night.
[01:16:40.387 --> 01:16:41.608]  They would say, oh, we'll sell bullion.
[01:16:41.968 --> 01:16:44.390]  Then they'd bait and switch, because I would find out like a week.
[01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:46.031]  So you'd see a sponsor for a week.
[01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:53.715]  I'd say, when I get this number out and you do this, I know you sell collectibles, but I want you to just pitch, you know, bullion and stuff with like a 10% markup.
[01:16:53.755 --> 01:16:54.876]  I thought, oh, we'll do that.
[01:16:54.916 --> 01:16:55.356]  We promise.
[01:16:55.756 --> 01:16:57.177]  And then they would never do it.
[01:16:57.257 --> 01:16:59.499]  So I was like, wait, I want to get Kirk Elliott on as a guest.
[01:16:59.519 --> 01:17:00.960]  You're like, hey, I've been trying to talk to you for a while.
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:02.600]  I've known about you going back decades.
[01:17:02.661 --> 01:17:03.341]  Boom, it's here.
[01:17:03.821 --> 01:17:04.422]  It's the time.
[01:17:05.267 --> 01:17:09.110]  People need to call, talk to your folks, get a consultation, and then take action.
[01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:11.391]  What are the different services you guys offer as well?
[01:17:11.531 --> 01:17:14.894]  It's not just people pay you cash or with a credit card for silver or gold.
[01:17:15.194 --> 01:17:18.236]  You're recommending mainly silver because that's obviously the thing that's going up the most.
[01:17:18.276 --> 01:17:19.177]  It has the most to grow.
[01:17:19.537 --> 01:17:21.578]  Gold has a lot to grow as well, but nothing compared to silver.
[01:17:22.239 --> 01:17:25.081]  But you've got a lot of other great services as well for people to get into gold and silver right now.
[01:17:25.981 --> 01:17:26.461]  Well, yeah.
[01:17:26.501 --> 01:17:29.922]  So either gold or silver in their physical form.
[01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:32.323]  We're recommending silver because it's outperforming.
[01:17:32.823 --> 01:17:35.984]  But you can actually take delivery of it at home.
[01:17:36.645 --> 01:17:41.526]  You can store it at what I think is the best depository in America.
[01:17:41.586 --> 01:17:43.587]  It's Texas Precious Metals Depository.
[01:17:44.147 --> 01:17:51.393]  You have the safety of Texas, right, which is very favorable towards precious metals legislatively.
[01:17:52.074 --> 01:17:54.876]  They have 100% insurance on that storage, literally 100%.
[01:17:55.917 --> 01:18:05.665]  Forget about FDIC that only has 1.1 something percent of all deposits covered and a $250,000 fake phony threshold of too many banks going under.
[01:18:05.685 --> 01:18:06.326]  They don't have that.
[01:18:07.046 --> 01:18:10.806]  And it's segregated in your name only and singular ownership.
[01:18:10.806 --> 01:18:13.166]  I mean, the ultimate in safety and storage.
[01:18:13.166 --> 01:18:14.966]  But not everybody wants to store their stuff.
[01:18:14.966 --> 01:18:16.286]  Some people want it at home.
[01:18:16.286 --> 01:18:17.166]  Doesn't matter.
[01:18:17.166 --> 01:18:19.646]  We can handle either one of them and take care of that.
[01:18:19.646 --> 01:18:24.566]   But where most people have their wealth, Alex, is in retirement accounts.
[01:18:24.497 --> 01:18:32.402]  You know, in today's world, not a lot of people have a lot of money sitting around because they've had to spend it all to live after pandemic shutdowns and everything else.
[01:18:32.883 --> 01:18:42.729]  So we can do tax-free IRA rollovers from your current custodian into a custodian that will allow you to have physical metals in your IRA.
[01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:48.553]  So IRAs could be a SEP, a simple, an inherited IRA, a traditional Roth.
[01:18:48.633 --> 01:18:52.576]  If it has IRA in the name, you can actually own physical silver with it.
[01:18:53.257 --> 01:18:59.822]  Or you can do non IRA ownership of silver that you take delivery of it at home or in storage.
[01:19:00.343 --> 01:19:15.996]  So there's a lot that we can do to help people safeguard and hedge their paper assets in a world that's falling apart, in a world where people are gripped with fear, afraid that their banks are going to go out of business and they don't know what to do.
[01:19:16.576 --> 01:19:18.978]  Well, we can help them figure out what to do.
[01:19:19.018 --> 01:19:22.361]  This is where we hold your hand through the economy.
[01:19:22.781 --> 01:19:25.023]  We want a lifetime relationship with our clients.
[01:19:25.443 --> 01:19:30.407]  We'll let you know when it's time to buy, sell, reallocate, get out of Dodge, do whatever needs to be done.
[01:19:31.087 --> 01:19:32.048]  That's what we do.
[01:19:32.548 --> 01:19:35.531]  And so just give us a call and we'll help you out.
[01:19:37.159 --> 01:19:47.004]  We've got about 10 minutes left before Daniel Esselin joins us on the aftermath of Bilderberg a couple weeks ago and then all the big economic developments as well, because that's really the front and center situation.
[01:19:47.044 --> 01:19:50.906]  But just recapping what you covered earlier and other key points that you haven't gotten into yet.
[01:19:51.854 --> 01:20:00.237]  Yeah, so when we look at what's happening globally, why are we so concerned?
[01:20:00.317 --> 01:20:06.599]  You and I have talked about central bank digital currency, Alex, for the last five months, because it's a big deal.
[01:20:07.019 --> 01:20:15.943]  It's the change of private paper money to full-on, big brother, in-your-face surveillance of digital money, right?
[01:20:17.023 --> 01:20:30.903]  So another reason why I know that this whole thing with Saudi Arabia is so big, the Bank for International Settlements, Project Enbridge, which you and I, I think, man, we discussed that I think six weeks ago.
[01:20:32.365 --> 01:20:43.229]  But it's now making major news because Saudi Arabia joined the Bank for International Settlements and China led Central Bank Digital Currency Project.
[01:20:43.269 --> 01:20:52.352]  So they get rid of the dollar, they go in, because what the BRICS nations want to do, Alex, is not just trade back and forth with their own currencies.
[01:20:52.712 --> 01:21:05.061]   Like, if China is doing business with Russia, You know, they're going to trade back and forth in rubles or yuan, or if they're doing business with India, they'll use the rupee or whatever.
[01:21:05.081 --> 01:21:16.410]  That to me is a temporary step into a bigger direction where they want their own central bank, native central bank, with a native currency for the BRICS union.
[01:21:16.831 --> 01:21:17.771]  Let's call it the BRIC.
[01:21:18.352 --> 01:21:22.735]  Whatever they're going to call it, I don't know, but for sake of illustration, let's say that that currency is called the BRIC.
[01:21:23.616 --> 01:21:33.604]  And it's going to be digital and it's going to be backed by gold according to what China is now saying at some of these BRICS Nations meetings.
[01:21:34.284 --> 01:21:38.208]  And that's why they've been hoarding, that's why China's been hoarding silver and gold.
[01:21:39.161 --> 01:21:45.142]  Well, yeah, so I was going to say it's like they've got an estimated 30,000 tons of gold.
[01:21:45.162 --> 01:21:46.223]  30,000 tons.
[01:21:46.603 --> 01:21:48.443]  I mean, that's that's a lot.
[01:21:49.123 --> 01:21:57.285]  Obviously, when you're talking about how many ounces are in a pound, how many pounds are in a ton, and they've got 30,000 that I mean, it's astronomical number.
[01:21:57.806 --> 01:21:59.706]  So they need that to back a currency.
[01:22:00.086 --> 01:22:02.787]  Now, they're also like what you had previously mentioned.
[01:22:03.827 --> 01:22:10.589]  Which we brought to light about a month ago is they're encouraging all of their citizens to buy silver.
[01:22:11.109 --> 01:22:15.291]  So you can't really back a currency with silver because it's not valued high enough.
[01:22:15.371 --> 01:22:16.811]  It would take up all the silver in the world.
[01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:17.631]  There's not that much.
[01:22:19.172 --> 01:22:26.434]  But they want to encourage their citizens to buy silver to stick it to the Western banks that have those naked short positions.
[01:22:26.794 --> 01:22:29.715]  Because if silver goes up, those banks lose money handover.
[01:22:29.755 --> 01:22:31.796]  So we're in a full-on global economic war.
[01:22:33.334 --> 01:22:33.914]  Yes, sir.
[01:22:34.335 --> 01:22:35.135]  Massive one.
[01:22:35.195 --> 01:22:41.979]  And so now, it's not just Saudi Arabia joining the Bank for International Settlements project that's a big deal.
[01:22:41.999 --> 01:22:50.724]  94% of the global central banks are now exploring to go into digital money.
[01:22:51.570 --> 01:22:51.730]  Right.
[01:22:51.750 --> 01:23:03.235]  But when they do that, you're going to start to see this demonizing that starts to happen where they demonize decentralized blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever.
[01:23:03.295 --> 01:23:03.515]  Right.
[01:23:03.595 --> 01:23:05.035]  So because why?
[01:23:05.376 --> 01:23:06.776]  Those actually are private.
[01:23:07.356 --> 01:23:07.496]  Right.
[01:23:07.536 --> 01:23:10.418]  When you have decentralized blockchain, they are private.
[01:23:10.838 --> 01:23:20.042]   So to me, gold and silver and Like cryptocurrency have a similar component where people want profit and people want privacy.
[01:23:20.542 --> 01:23:24.684]  The problem with any kind of cryptocurrency is it's digital.
[01:23:25.384 --> 01:23:26.705]  What if there's an EMP blast?
[01:23:26.745 --> 01:23:36.429]  What if they know your IP address and they can switch off the ability to access your coin wallet or whatever based on your IP address like they did with Russia?
[01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:38.030]  Coinbase did that with Russia.
[01:23:39.591 --> 01:23:46.937]  Or just expand that to your religious views, or your political views, or your digital social profile.
[01:23:46.957 --> 01:23:48.599]  And we know they're already doing it.
[01:23:48.659 --> 01:23:57.987]  The globalist at Deimos at the UN say, and the head of the EU says, as soon as we have a central bank digital currency in, we're going to be able to control people's behavior.
[01:23:58.247 --> 01:23:59.128]  Larry Fink said that.
[01:23:59.168 --> 01:24:00.269]  They said that's the Holy Grail.
[01:24:02.612 --> 01:24:03.033]  He did.
[01:24:03.213 --> 01:24:07.157]  He said that he just said something like that again two days ago, right?
[01:24:07.197 --> 01:24:16.326]  And so when he says that and BlackRock has got their fingers in everything in global finance, okay, we should really start to listen, right?
[01:24:16.426 --> 01:24:22.772]  So now China is working hard to displace the US dollar.
[01:24:23.473 --> 01:24:31.076]  And it's not, they don't have to work super duper hard, Alex, because we're working hard to dismantle the US dollar, right?
[01:24:31.096 --> 01:24:38.880]  It's like, my word, Biden's doing a really good job of devaluing our dollar and creating this monopoly money that the rest of the world doesn't want.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:57.106]  So you look at when a treasury auction happens, like when the Fed issues a treasury auction, the Treasury Department does, and they say, whoa, the treasuries are so good, the rest of the world wants them, we sold all of this treasury auction, 100% participation.
[01:24:57.126 --> 01:25:01.468]  It's like, I would challenge them every single day to say, who is the buyer?
[01:25:02.401 --> 01:25:05.082]  Who bought those treasuries that fulfilled your auction?
[01:25:05.102 --> 01:25:07.863]  Because more often than not, it's the Fed.
[01:25:07.983 --> 01:25:08.983]  It's the Federal Reserve.
[01:25:09.343 --> 01:25:12.745]  With money that they print out of thin air, they're buying our toxic U.S.
[01:25:12.805 --> 01:25:13.205]  treasuries.
[01:25:13.245 --> 01:25:18.607]  That's going to create more inflation because the numbers international flow into U.S.
[01:25:18.667 --> 01:25:20.067]  treasuries is not there.
[01:25:20.907 --> 01:25:23.448]  Countries like China are dumping U.S.
[01:25:23.508 --> 01:25:25.229]  treasuries like it's yesterday's trash.
[01:25:26.045 --> 01:25:34.231]  Russia got out of them completely a couple of years ago and country after country after country is now saying there's a better option.
[01:25:34.832 --> 01:25:35.592]  With the U.S.
[01:25:35.633 --> 01:25:38.835]  losing its petrodollar status this is going to accelerate.
[01:25:39.355 --> 01:25:42.338]  Why would any other country want to buy U.S.
[01:25:42.418 --> 01:26:01.532]   Treasuries if we don't have built-in demand for our currency anymore and we're spending like drunken sailors and our debts on our service on our debt is almost a trillion dollars a year now on just interest-only payments Alex, nobody is going to want that currency and that's what's happening.
[01:26:01.892 --> 01:26:06.996]  This is why we are on the verge of an absolute monetary implosion.
[01:26:07.016 --> 01:26:07.557]  The U.S.
[01:26:07.617 --> 01:26:11.960]  economy is crumbling while the BRICS nations are exploding in prominence.
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:16.924]  Do you see it coming as a thief in the night or it's already been incremental for so long?
[01:26:16.944 --> 01:26:21.347]  I think we just continue this horrible slide but there's got to be some point though where it just collapses.
[01:26:22.765 --> 01:26:23.266]  I think so.
[01:26:23.306 --> 01:26:25.489]  I think people are going to say, what just happened?
[01:26:25.509 --> 01:26:25.989]  That was like...
[01:26:26.863 --> 01:26:27.884]  An overnight thing.
[01:26:28.004 --> 01:26:32.007]  It's like, no, it's, it's like what, something that you had mentioned earlier.
[01:26:32.027 --> 01:26:36.190]  It's like, yeah, it's an overnight success that took 25 years to accomplish.
[01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:36.410]  Right?
[01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:41.955]  So this has been going on for quite some time, but people don't cover it.
[01:26:42.035 --> 01:26:47.739]  Mainstream media doesn't cover adequately the rise of the BRICS nations.
[01:26:48.079 --> 01:26:53.363]  So even the FDIC, here's, here's another example of how they don't cover things that they don't want you to know.
[01:26:53.944 --> 01:26:56.346]  So the FDIC came out with a list.
[01:26:56.886 --> 01:27:04.606]  last week of 63 banks that are in financial hardship that had to have a capital infusion.
[01:27:04.606 --> 01:27:09.246]  And they just said, "How many banks went into a reverse repo mechanism with the Fed?"
[01:27:09.246 --> 01:27:10.246]  And there were 63 of them.
[01:27:10.842 --> 01:27:13.844]  People have been trying and trying and trying to find that list of banks.
[01:27:14.264 --> 01:27:24.189]  They didn't publish it because they don't want people to know which banks they're referencing because that'll cause a run on the banks and on those banks in particular.
[01:27:24.689 --> 01:27:28.451]  So they give partial bad news that people don't understand.
[01:27:28.551 --> 01:27:32.533]  All it says is that 63 banks went into reverse repurchase agreements with the Fed.
[01:27:34.119 --> 01:27:38.324]  Common person will say, well, I don't even know what that means, or they're not even going to see the story.
[01:27:38.945 --> 01:27:40.667]  Nobody is actually going to see that story.
[01:27:41.127 --> 01:27:48.776]  But to me, that's massive, because we're going to see another run of bank failures that is going to dwarf Silicon Valley Bank.
[01:27:49.157 --> 01:28:03.100]   And in fact, just yesterday, Flow Bank in Switzerland went belly up. They went into bankruptcy and what does the Swiss franc, what do they cover
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:14.020]   in Switzerland? A hundred thousand Swiss francs is their limit. So anybody that has over a hundred thousand, and there's a warning on that website. It's like, yeah, we had financial
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:15.580]  problems, we're shutting our doors.
[01:28:12.939 --> 01:28:15.521]  We had financial problems shutting our doors.
[01:28:16.001 --> 01:28:20.844]  Anybody that has over a hundred thousand Swiss francs, it's like, okay, you're probably not going to get it.
[01:28:20.904 --> 01:28:23.766]  We'll see what the bankruptcy court judge says, right?
[01:28:24.387 --> 01:28:28.529]  So, yet banks are going to start failing even more.
[01:28:28.549 --> 01:28:39.182]   I think that's after the bank failed in Philly like a month and a half ago, now we've got a European bank that's failing,
[01:28:39.182 --> 01:28:41.382]  these are going to start to fail.
[01:28:41.382 --> 01:28:53.582]   And so the importance to me of that stupid FDIC report that said 63 banks got a capital infusion, the reason that's important is because in March of this year, the bank temp funding
[01:28:53.582 --> 01:28:55.983]  program sunset and expired.
[01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:55.778]  The reason that's important is because in March of this year, the Bank Temp Funding Program sunset and expired.
[01:28:56.078 --> 01:28:58.699]  So there is no more emergency capital going into banks.
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:05.361]  And they know that you can't actually have them go into FDIC receivership because FDIC has run out of money.
[01:29:05.742 --> 01:29:11.023]  So they're allowing these banks to take these loans, these capital influx on these reverse repo agreements.
[01:29:11.503 --> 01:29:17.824]   But that's the last So let me ask you this, exactly in closing, because you've done an amazing job, we've
[01:29:17.824 --> 01:29:22.384]  talked to you 10 hours, we've got Daniel Esselstyn about to connect with us.
[01:29:22.384 --> 01:29:31.423]   Trump's big concern, the media spun this six months ago, he's like, "Man, I hope the economy crashes before I get in, because then they'll blame Biden and I'll have the support to fix
[01:29:22.188 --> 01:29:31.696]  Trump's big concern, the media spun this six months ago, is he's like, man, I hope the economy crashes before I get in because then they'll blame Biden and I'll have the support to fix it.
[01:29:32.276 --> 01:29:35.979]  If it crashes once I get in, which is already happening, then they're going to blame me.
[01:29:36.039 --> 01:29:38.041]  I might not have the political capital to fix it.
[01:29:38.081 --> 01:29:40.302]  He was a very true, real statement.
[01:29:40.903 --> 01:29:46.367]   I mean, it's already basically collapsed, but I just hope that the globalists don't Yeah.
[01:29:46.386 --> 01:29:55.626]   detonate it once he gets into office and then try to use that as political capital against him so that he can't turn it around because they think the public is too economically
[01:29:55.626 --> 01:29:59.006]  ignorant to realize this is a long-term situation.
[01:29:59.006 --> 01:30:11.828]   Yeah, I mean, the left always assumes that the public is ignorant, but they're going But they're going to find pretty stinking soon that we're not as dumb as they think that we are, right?
[01:30:11.868 --> 01:30:15.552]  And so our wallets tell us that we're not stupid.
[01:30:15.652 --> 01:30:20.177]  Our wallets tell us that something is not right and that people are lying.
[01:30:20.237 --> 01:30:28.905]   And I'm hoping and praying That Bill Clinton's words were prophetic when he said, yeah, it's the economy, stupid.
[01:30:28.985 --> 01:30:30.786]  People are going to vote with their wallets, right?
[01:30:30.846 --> 01:30:32.668]  Because come up this election time.
[01:30:32.688 --> 01:30:35.110]  Yeah, I don't care what stories are spun.
[01:30:35.250 --> 01:30:40.195]  I don't care what they try to do to suspend the election, stop the election, come up with all kinds of lies.
[01:30:40.295 --> 01:30:43.958]  Your wallet will tell you a completely different story.
[01:30:44.398 --> 01:30:54.490]   And my prayer is that people start waking up to that fact that these The economy is worse than what people actually are being told, but they already know that.
[01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:56.994]  People already know that, Alex.
[01:30:57.014 --> 01:30:58.696]  That's right, people need to get ahead of it now.
[01:31:02.359 --> 01:31:09.419]   And on the weekend there's not as many people there, they'll call you back on Monday, leave your name and number or go email them and say I want a consultation, free consultation
[01:31:09.419 --> 01:31:18.979]   right now because you'll probably in this crazy market actually make money but I think it's clear to say you'll at least meet inflation instead of losing money and everything else.
[01:31:18.979 --> 01:31:23.979]   You need to get silver, that's the big thing, get some gold as well, but Kirk's absolutely right, silver is a thing.
[01:31:23.658 --> 01:31:24.018]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:31:24.038 --> 01:31:24.459]  We'll talk real soon.
[01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:36.679]  the most room to grow, and it is growing the most, 720-605-3900, 720-605-3900, or KEPM.com/gold.
[01:31:36.679 --> 01:31:40.519]  And they know that we sent you when you go to /gold, so be sure and do that.
[01:31:40.519 --> 01:31:43.878]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, God bless you, and thank you for all your support.
[01:31:43.878 --> 01:31:44.878]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:31:44.878 --> 01:31:45.878]  We'll talk real soon.
[01:31:45.878 --> 01:31:46.878]  God bless.
[01:31:46.684 --> 01:31:47.385]  Boy, he is dead on.
[01:31:47.405 --> 01:31:49.967]  We're going to hear a special report that's brand new.
[01:31:50.047 --> 01:31:54.030]  I'll tell you, John Ballin thought we could be shut down here, so we came close.
[01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:55.571]  He put out eight reports yesterday.
[01:31:56.292 --> 01:32:01.436]  They're all up at Band.Video, and we're going to post a bunch of them on Real Alex Jones on X while we're getting Daniel Esselstyn connected.
[01:32:02.176 --> 01:32:05.139]  Here is, the CIA is as evil as the day is long.
[01:32:05.158 --> 01:32:16.318]  We'll be back with Daniel Esselin with huge breaking news.
[01:32:16.328 --> 01:32:35.466]  The CIA's 1953 research budget allotted roughly $10 million to be dedicated to human experimentation involving hypnosis and amnesia, utilizing the effects of heroin, morphine, barbiturates, amphetamines, LSD, BZ, scopolamine, and other hallucination-causing compounds.
[01:32:35.646 --> 01:32:41.988]  Project Chatter was conducted in order to identify agents synthetic and natural that could enhance interrogation.
[01:32:42.468 --> 01:32:48.029]  Project Bluebird experimented with the possibility of using humans as mind-controlled warfare agents.
[01:32:48.769 --> 01:32:58.352]  CIA Director Alan Dulles was quoted as complaining that they did not have enough human guinea pigs to try these extraordinary techniques.
[01:32:59.072 --> 01:33:02.293]  Thus, officially, the MKUltra project was sanctioned in 1953.
[01:33:04.193 --> 01:33:14.635]  A 1977 FOIA request unearthed 20,000 documents related to MKUltra after Frank Church and the Ford administration began investigating the CIA in 1975.
[01:33:15.555 --> 01:33:17.876]  Most of those documents were destroyed.
[01:33:18.076 --> 01:33:27.918]  However, bureaucratic red tape bungling allowed 20,000 documents to survive, as they had been incorrectly stored in a financial records building.
[01:33:28.527 --> 01:33:33.830]  We are not professing to tell you the complete story of these activities.
[01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:37.311]  We are professing to tell you the complete story that we know.
[01:33:37.491 --> 01:33:42.954]  The United States government has perfected a technological capability.
[01:33:43.474 --> 01:33:48.117]  At the same time, that capability at any time could be turned around on the American people.
[01:33:49.017 --> 01:34:06.654]   There would be no place to hide the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it I'm Christine Nicola, born July of 1962, rendering me 32 years of age.
[01:34:07.554 --> 01:34:15.316]  I was a subject in radiation as well as mind control and drug experiments performed by a man I knew as Dr. Green.
[01:34:15.756 --> 01:34:23.779]  All these experiments were performed on me in conjunction with mind control techniques and drugs in Tucson, Arizona.
[01:34:24.119 --> 01:34:37.075]  And now, due to the unyielding efforts of John Greenwald, founder of the document archive website TheBlackVault.com, we are learning that the notorious MKUltra research was just scraping the surface.
[01:34:37.276 --> 01:34:41.160]  Everything has been kind of lumped into this mind control MKUltra program.
[01:34:41.901 --> 01:34:52.206]  What these thousands of pages that I just received and put online at theblackvault.com, what they prove is we do not have the full story.
[01:34:52.546 --> 01:35:03.651]  What they prove is MKUltra was just simply the tip of the iceberg, that there was a heck of a lot more going on, that there are project names that are still redacted.
[01:35:04.231 --> 01:35:10.135]  And why that's important is, according to the CIA, they've kind of quote-unquote released everything to us.
[01:35:10.615 --> 01:35:12.916]  So investigators have had these for years.
[01:35:13.557 --> 01:35:16.258]  But what these prove is that's not entirely true.
[01:35:17.039 --> 01:35:27.645]  And these documents show that they were not even related to MKUltra, but they were doing experiments where they are implanting devices and they started with dogs.
[01:35:27.765 --> 01:35:30.647]  And Newsweek wrote this up, did a great job with it.
[01:35:31.267 --> 01:35:38.074]  That they were implanting these things in dog brains and were able to control dogs and have success with it.
[01:35:38.615 --> 01:35:40.657]  Now, you might think, well, that's just dogs.
[01:35:40.677 --> 01:35:41.138]  Who cares?
[01:35:41.178 --> 01:35:44.921]  Well, this was the tip of the iceberg when it came to that research.
[01:35:45.002 --> 01:35:45.482]  What comes next?
[01:35:45.522 --> 01:35:47.244]  We've had tens of thousands of military volunteer.
[01:35:50.367 --> 01:35:51.968]  They got guys that will volunteer to go on suicide missions.
[01:35:51.988 --> 01:35:53.408]  They've already volunteered, they've already done it all.
[01:35:54.228 --> 01:36:09.954]  I know people that got recruited into these programs, and I know people that refused the programs, but they, in the 80s, they already had giant, literal underground facilities in Maryland where they were creating all sorts of people, let's just say, that could infiltrate things with hidden devices in their bodies.
[01:36:10.214 --> 01:36:22.723]  As a republic that fought valiantly to end the horror of the Nazi regime and its experimentation on humanity, why in the world do we continue to allow this research to prey on our fellow citizens?
[01:36:23.164 --> 01:36:26.887]  The intelligence community has six ways from Sunday of getting back at you.
[01:36:27.347 --> 01:36:29.629]  You briefed the press, did you not, when you were there?
[01:36:29.909 --> 01:36:37.955]  When we, the CIA, wanted to circulate disinformation on a particular issue, disinformation is not necessarily a lie.
[01:36:39.798 --> 01:36:40.959]  Maybe a half-truth.
[01:36:41.879 --> 01:36:43.520]  And we would pick out a journalist.
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:49.383]  I would go do the briefing and hope that he would put the information in print.
[01:36:49.743 --> 01:37:01.328]  The Central Intelligence Agency operates under National Security Council Memo 10-2, which says that it can engage in criminal activity, it can overthrow governments, it can control media, as long as it's plausibly deniable.
[01:37:01.929 --> 01:37:14.854]   Once these agencies are imbued with this power over speech, and it becomes embedded and mature, the entire and ebb and flow of elections comes under its heel.
[01:37:14.854 --> 01:37:17.894]   How many times did I tell you the whole Sandy Hook lawsuit operation
[01:37:17.894 --> 01:37:21.375]  was run by the CIA and the FBI and now it's all admitted?
[01:37:21.375 --> 01:37:24.295]  Gavin O'Glenis is a contracting officer at the CIA.
[01:37:24.295 --> 01:37:30.574]   O'Glenis worked for the FBI in 2021 and 2022 in San Diego office, moved on to Homeland Security
[01:37:30.574 --> 01:37:34.574]   where he conducted asylum interviews at the Southern border, and now works for the CIA
[01:37:34.574 --> 01:37:39.135]   managing multimillion dollar contracts across government agencies and private sector vendors.
[01:37:39.135 --> 01:37:41.694]  We call it a nudge, a nudge, a nudge.
[01:37:39.895 --> 01:37:40.415]  A nudge.
[01:37:41.636 --> 01:37:46.280]  Sometimes you just have to get a quick look just to see what happens, right?
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.081]  And how does that happen?
[01:37:48.162 --> 01:37:56.389]  You put a post out there or you have some fake profile say something that triggers, that we know is going to trigger them.
[01:37:56.449 --> 01:37:57.890]  Like we already know your history.
[01:37:57.910 --> 01:38:00.552]  Like a big influence that you're, influencer that you're after.
[01:38:00.592 --> 01:38:02.554]  You're always one of the biggest and loudest.
[01:38:03.174 --> 01:38:03.695]  Alex Jones.
[01:38:03.735 --> 01:38:05.656]  Yeah, so we were after him.
[01:38:05.996 --> 01:38:06.417]  You are?
[01:38:06.477 --> 01:38:07.858]  Are you still after him?
[01:38:08.397 --> 01:38:08.517]  Why?
[01:38:08.537 --> 01:38:09.398]  Because he's broke.
[01:38:09.698 --> 01:38:11.279]  He got found guilty.
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:13.041]  And had to pay like a hundred million dollars.
[01:38:13.981 --> 01:38:14.982]  So what, why did we have to?
[01:38:15.583 --> 01:38:16.243]  We're not in anymore.
[01:38:16.844 --> 01:38:17.644]  Just to get the money from?
[01:38:17.724 --> 01:38:17.925]  Yeah.
[01:38:19.466 --> 01:38:20.627]  Was that court case used?
[01:38:21.147 --> 01:38:21.768]  Was that a CIA thing?
[01:38:21.788 --> 01:38:22.248]  Sure it was.
[01:38:22.468 --> 01:38:23.149]  That was an agency thing?
[01:38:24.827 --> 01:38:26.089]  Actually, it was a defamation case.
[01:38:26.309 --> 01:38:28.312]  So it's a civil, not government case.
[01:38:29.413 --> 01:38:31.416]  But we were looking at all of his followers.
[01:38:31.516 --> 01:38:34.299]  On our purview, it's a civil matter.
[01:38:35.181 --> 01:38:40.307]  But since they got all this access to his stuff, and it's there...
[01:38:41.886 --> 01:38:43.768]  What can we go find?
[01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:46.912]  And did you find anything?
[01:38:46.952 --> 01:38:48.154]  I can't determine anything.
[01:38:48.214 --> 01:38:50.116]  We don't encourage people.
[01:38:50.396 --> 01:38:55.482]  We just say there's no federal statute being broken.
[01:38:55.502 --> 01:38:59.847]  But you do have the option for a civil case.
[01:38:59.967 --> 01:39:01.249]  It's a pretty good case.
[01:39:02.450 --> 01:39:02.850]  Nice.
[01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:04.871]  Our opinion.
[01:39:05.391 --> 01:39:06.892]  Oh, that makes so much sense.
[01:39:07.432 --> 01:39:09.073]  I have a cousin who's a lawyer.
[01:39:09.113 --> 01:39:10.493]  So that's a lot of these cases.
[01:39:10.553 --> 01:39:12.494]  They're kind of encouraged by the FBI?
[01:39:12.534 --> 01:39:15.975]  Yeah, like, there's nothing federally, federal law, we can do.
[01:39:16.115 --> 01:39:16.856]  But civilly...
[01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:37.975]   What the establishment engage in is lawfare where they engage in legal complexity opponents or dissidents in order to drain their resources whether that's Donald Trump or In my experience, living on your knees, you die a lot quicker, and your life's terrible, and you die a thousand deaths.
[01:39:37.995 --> 01:39:39.035]  That's been said many times.
[01:39:39.055 --> 01:39:51.615]   voice may face a series of measures to bring them down but the common problem is dissent and the ability to convey information to you that may make you less obedient and more compliant.
[01:39:51.615 --> 01:40:02.095]   In my experience living on your knees you die a lot quicker and your life's terrible and you die a thousand deaths as I've said many times hero dies but once but the coward dies a thousand
[01:40:02.095 --> 01:40:04.916]   a thousand deaths i'm very honored to be here with you Very honored to be here with you.
[01:40:04.936 --> 01:40:05.818]  I'm very thankful to God.
[01:40:05.838 --> 01:40:10.004]  I'm very thankful to the audience and the great activists and the crew for battling through all this.
[01:40:10.024 --> 01:40:11.726]  We're being totally vindicated right now.
[01:40:12.167 --> 01:40:14.530]  So this is quite a moment, but we are winning battles.
[01:40:14.891 --> 01:40:18.236]  We've not won the war, but we are turning the tide together.
[01:40:18.786 --> 01:40:25.550]  As an ex-CI agent opposed to the disinformation activities in which I was involved.
[01:40:25.570 --> 01:40:31.054]  I admit that I was involved and I think it served no useful purpose.
[01:40:31.714 --> 01:40:36.978]  Propagandizing the American public or Congress is not the CI's job.
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:45.165]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:40:45.626 --> 01:40:50.626]  visit infowars.com/show and share the link today.
[01:40:50.626 --> 01:41:04.626]  All right, Daniel Estelin has been gracious enough to join us for a full hour.
[01:41:01.016 --> 01:41:04.558]  All right, Daniel Estelin has been gracious enough to join us for a full hour.
[01:41:05.058 --> 01:41:08.979]  I'm on a little secret mission, so I'm going to host with him for 30 minutes and I'm going to leave.
[01:41:08.999 --> 01:41:09.960]  He's going to finish up.
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:14.302]  We're very honored he's doing that because we couldn't get even half the info in 30 minutes.
[01:41:15.202 --> 01:41:18.444]  Daniel, so much happening in the world economy, the attack on the Russian economy.
[01:41:18.464 --> 01:41:19.344]  You lived all over the world.
[01:41:19.384 --> 01:41:22.625]  You're a number one bestselling author, expert on globalism, the New World Order.
[01:41:23.085 --> 01:41:24.926]  We now know more about what's happening in the world.
[01:41:24.946 --> 01:41:27.627]  We've got Saudi Arabia moving away from the dollar right now.
[01:41:27.727 --> 01:41:28.448]  Huge moves.
[01:41:29.008 --> 01:41:29.768]  That are unfolding.
[01:41:29.808 --> 01:41:31.069]  But I have a selfish question.
[01:41:31.789 --> 01:41:32.809]  I think it also pertains to everybody.
[01:41:32.829 --> 01:41:35.891]  I know you've, I was talking to you during the break, you followed it.
[01:41:37.031 --> 01:41:38.832]  Everything confirmed now, and I've told you for two weeks.
[01:41:39.272 --> 01:41:42.213]  CRO, appointed by the court, tries to shut us down outside of law.
[01:41:42.993 --> 01:41:44.074]  All these crazy filings.
[01:41:44.234 --> 01:41:45.134]  Admits it all in court.
[01:41:45.174 --> 01:41:47.995]  Tries to have me removed yesterday and close our doors.
[01:41:48.435 --> 01:41:49.736]  And the federal judge said no.
[01:41:50.756 --> 01:41:52.877]  And he said, I'm not shutting Alex Jones down.
[01:41:53.117 --> 01:41:54.818]  And basically discovered this was all happening.
[01:41:55.278 --> 01:42:05.818]   To me, why would people in the federal government who are in the federal bankruptcy system, we now know involve the Justice Department, that's come out, be so desperate as to move
[01:42:05.818 --> 01:42:08.618]  in a brazen move to remove me from the air?
[01:42:08.618 --> 01:42:11.018]  I don't think that's just about me.
[01:42:11.018 --> 01:42:12.557]  I'm not arrogant.
[01:42:12.557 --> 01:42:16.498]  To me, it's a sign of desperation and big things that are about to happen.
[01:42:16.498 --> 01:42:25.118]   And somehow I've been listed with a few other people, like Steve Bannon's reporting to jail on July 1st for removal ahead of something big.
[01:42:25.409 --> 01:42:27.270]  Daniel, I really respect your expert view on that.
[01:42:27.611 --> 01:42:32.734]  Speak to that briefly, and then let's move into all the huge issues you've got here at the end of the petrodollar model.
[01:42:33.394 --> 01:42:41.940]  What it means, who's behind the gay pride movements, who's behind and what has to do with the hatred they feel for Alex Jones, Tucker and Trump.
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:45.162]  So I guess I'm kind of going to the first, the last point first.
[01:42:46.523 --> 01:42:47.123]  Thanks for being here.
[01:42:48.484 --> 01:42:49.984]  Thanks a lot, Alex, for the invitation.
[01:42:50.044 --> 01:42:51.104]  Always there to help you out.
[01:42:51.764 --> 01:42:53.465]  So I think Russell Brand said it best.
[01:42:53.765 --> 01:42:57.346]  I'm not sure if it was yesterday or today or the day before when you had him on.
[01:42:57.366 --> 01:42:58.466]  They're desperate, as you said.
[01:42:58.506 --> 01:42:59.567]  They're absolutely desperate.
[01:43:00.147 --> 01:43:01.247]  It's a do or die for them.
[01:43:01.547 --> 01:43:04.528]  This is the election, maybe the last election in the history of the United States.
[01:43:05.308 --> 01:43:07.089]  So the idea is that if they lose, they're gone.
[01:43:07.949 --> 01:43:11.010]  Meaning that Trump, whoever wins, obviously talking about Donald Trump.
[01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:15.071]  And so if he wins, a lot of these people are going to go to prison and a lot of them are going to die.
[01:43:15.976 --> 01:43:17.297]  There are models and it's deathbed.
[01:43:17.717 --> 01:43:20.419]  The model is, needless to say, the petrodollar model.
[01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:23.341]  It's based on the idea of permanent expansion.
[01:43:24.322 --> 01:43:28.484]  Globally, but you can only permanently expand as long as there's space on the planet Earth.
[01:43:28.744 --> 01:43:30.005]  We talked about this last week.
[01:43:30.025 --> 01:43:31.266]  We talked about this the week before.
[01:43:32.127 --> 01:43:33.147]  Everybody understands this.
[01:43:33.728 --> 01:43:35.909]  And so the idea is that you have these two models.
[01:43:35.929 --> 01:43:39.832]  You have on the one hand, you have this global liberal banking financier model.
[01:43:39.852 --> 01:43:41.013]  These are the people, the parasites.
[01:43:41.833 --> 01:43:42.874]  The idea, they're not American.
[01:43:43.857 --> 01:43:44.777]  I'll explain that again.
[01:43:45.478 --> 01:43:50.920]  People, for some strange reason, believe that David Rockefeller is a quintessential American hero because he has the U.S.
[01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:51.321]  passport.
[01:43:51.341 --> 01:43:52.001]  Well, he's dead now.
[01:43:53.141 --> 01:43:53.622]  He's not.
[01:43:53.802 --> 01:43:55.002]  George Soros is not American.
[01:43:55.923 --> 01:43:57.864]  These people, JPMorgan, they're not American.
[01:43:59.124 --> 01:44:00.485]  Jamie Dimon is not American.
[01:44:00.505 --> 01:44:01.345]  They may have a U.S.
[01:44:01.365 --> 01:44:04.887]  passport, but they're not American in the sense that they're globalists.
[01:44:04.987 --> 01:44:07.328]  They're in the United States because that's where the money is.
[01:44:08.389 --> 01:44:12.771]  They will destroy the United States to save their own global financial liberal banking system.
[01:44:13.706 --> 01:44:21.989]  And the only way they can do this is at the expense of the United States or at the expense of Russia, because that's the biggest territory in the world, has all the natural resources.
[01:44:22.730 --> 01:44:25.851]  So these are the two areas of concern, the United States and Russia.
[01:44:26.791 --> 01:44:30.493]  So when people talk about, no, Donald Trump is a stooge of Putin.
[01:44:30.513 --> 01:44:31.013]  No, they're not.
[01:44:31.053 --> 01:44:31.553]  No, he's not.
[01:44:32.694 --> 01:44:38.576]  The idea is that Putin and Donald Trump, they share a common interest, survival of their nation state.
[01:44:39.898 --> 01:44:47.645]  And the global liberal banking financiers, we're talking about the parasites, we're talking about the Satanists, we're talking about the people who don't care about us.
[01:44:47.825 --> 01:44:51.308]  They want to destroy the world, they want to kill us, as many of us as possible.
[01:44:52.769 --> 01:44:59.875]  And this may sound like some wacky conspiracy theory, but I think, you know, you and I have proven over the years that we're anything but conspiracy theorists.
[01:45:01.216 --> 01:45:03.518]  And so, because again, we've been doing this for a long time.
[01:45:04.258 --> 01:45:05.640]  And so it's obvious what they're doing.
[01:45:06.593 --> 01:45:14.187]  And so again, as I said to you the first time we spoke two or three weeks back, I'm surprised you weren't imprisoned or killed a long time ago.
[01:45:14.207 --> 01:45:19.496]  Okay, I'm not advocating violence and I don't want anything to happen to my friend Alex Jones.
[01:45:20.353 --> 01:45:25.216]  But the point is, you've been at the forefront of this, you know, mission in the United States.
[01:45:25.636 --> 01:45:29.618]  You've been the voice of reason for a long, long, long, long time.
[01:45:30.178 --> 01:45:35.261]  I think the first time you and I spoke, I think it was back in 2006, when my book came out on the Bilderbergers.
[01:45:35.281 --> 01:45:36.502]  That was like 18 years ago.
[01:45:37.202 --> 01:45:37.482]  Okay?
[01:45:37.522 --> 01:45:38.743]  And we've been doing this for a long time.
[01:45:38.783 --> 01:45:41.344]  And you've been at it longer than, you know, longer than that, obviously.
[01:45:42.265 --> 01:45:45.727]  But the point is that the things that you've been saying, they've been calling you all kinds of crazy names.
[01:45:46.977 --> 01:45:49.478]  But all of this stuff, over time, has come true.
[01:45:50.198 --> 01:45:51.338]  And there's a reason for that.
[01:45:52.218 --> 01:45:55.959]  I remember in the Tucker Carlson interview, he said, you know, he was talking to Joe Rogan.
[01:45:55.979 --> 01:46:03.221]  He said, well Alex, you know, people are saying a lot of stuff about Alex Jones, but he predicted 9-11, long before it happened.
[01:46:04.281 --> 01:46:08.262]  We can talk about COVID, you know, that goes back to 2010, if I'm not mistaken.
[01:46:08.622 --> 01:46:10.123]  I first heard you talk about that.
[01:46:11.383 --> 01:46:16.943]   And so the idea that all this kind of stuff just happens just because, I mean, that's a wacky conspiracy theory.
[01:46:16.963 --> 01:46:21.266]  You can talk about coincidence theories, but you can never talk about conspiracy theories.
[01:46:21.666 --> 01:46:23.567]  So you've been dead on Alex for a very long time.
[01:46:24.147 --> 01:46:25.188]  And so again, I'm not surprised.
[01:46:25.248 --> 01:46:26.149]  It's do or die for them.
[01:46:26.229 --> 01:46:27.449]  It's do or die in many fronts.
[01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:29.451]  Okay, they're out of choices.
[01:46:30.311 --> 01:46:33.193]  They're out of choices and they're desperate and the time is running out.
[01:46:33.233 --> 01:46:34.173]  The elections is now.
[01:46:34.834 --> 01:46:36.715]  And now the latest thing is the Saudis.
[01:46:37.816 --> 01:46:41.178]  Well, the Saudis did not extend the fundamental petrodollar agreement.
[01:46:42.236 --> 01:46:58.526]  And so the United States, the Gibb State, because we have to separate the people of the United States, the so-called deplorables, who Hillary Clinton despises because they're absolutely quintessential American, okay, and these globalists who run the United States today.
[01:46:58.546 --> 01:47:06.631]  But for them, the idea that Saudi Arabia did not extend the fundamental petrodollar agreement, okay, that's a death knell for them.
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:09.940]  Well, that's right.
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:13.682]  I mean, you've been saying this is coming up for years and you were on a few weeks ago.
[01:47:14.103 --> 01:47:15.123]  You were saying it's imminent.
[01:47:15.143 --> 01:47:21.387]  And now for those that don't know, Saudi Arabia just days ago is now officially moving away and not extending the agreement.
[01:47:22.387 --> 01:47:27.510]  I mean, what the West has invaded Iraq and Libya just over talking about moving over to gold.
[01:47:28.811 --> 01:47:30.132]  This is seismically bigger.
[01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:49.735]  Well, you know, there's a story to it and it's quite a story and with your permission I'd like to tell the story so that, you know, one of the things Alex I've always liked about your show is that aside of, you know, your style which is absolutely American and I love that, okay, you educate people, okay, you make people see things they do not want to see.
[01:47:51.197 --> 01:47:52.478]  They do not want to see the truths.
[01:47:53.837 --> 01:48:00.599]  Because they'd like to believe, you know, the wacky nonsense that the government peddles as the truth, which has nothing to do with the reality.
[01:48:00.799 --> 01:48:01.300]  Tell the story.
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:01.880]  You've got the floor.
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:03.020]  I'm going to sit back and listen.
[01:48:04.081 --> 01:48:14.524]  So you see, again, on June the 9th, Sunday, the 80-year petrodollar deal that was the cornerstone of the year's global economic dominance expired.
[01:48:15.324 --> 01:48:21.326]  And what it means is that Saudi Arabia did not renew the pact, which, you know, was concluded on June the 8th, 1974.
[01:48:23.248 --> 01:48:26.691]  And many people are unaware, as they are unaware of everything around them.
[01:48:27.472 --> 01:48:35.419]  Okay, that the founding pact, like the most landmark deals between the United States and the West, was concluded through arm twisting and deception.
[01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:40.860]   And what happened was that on his way back from the Yalta Conference, The U.S.
[01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:50.188]  President Roosevelt, without the knowledge of the British, made a detour to the Swiss Canal where he met with King Abdulaziz Al Saud on board the cruiser USS Quincy.
[01:48:51.008 --> 01:48:53.390]  And that's why, you know, they call this thing the Quincy Pact.
[01:48:53.991 --> 01:49:01.938]  And Roosevelt agreed to oust the British Petroleum from the region in favor of the American oil companies in return for refusing to recognize Israel.
[01:49:01.998 --> 01:49:05.340]  And true, Roosevelt died a little bit, you know, a while later.
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:06.441]  A short while later.
[01:49:07.282 --> 01:49:08.503]  And the next U.S.
[01:49:08.523 --> 01:49:14.789]  President, Truman, he recognized the Jewish state 11 minutes after the Israelis declared themselves a nation state.
[01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:21.935]  And so, in 1973, the United States actually intervened in the Yom Kippur War on the side of Israel.
[01:49:23.712 --> 01:49:29.577]  Provoked an oil embargo by the Arab state, which quadrupled the oil price from $3 to $12 in literally a few months.
[01:49:30.457 --> 01:49:35.541]  And in general, the situation was beneficial to the United States and similar to modern realities.
[01:49:35.941 --> 01:49:44.048]  Europe suffered primarily from the lack of Arab oil market, as they are suffering now as a result of the Russian gas embargo.
[01:49:44.508 --> 01:49:59.877]  However, waiting for the next price increase, Kissinger appeared on the scene announcing his readiness to stop the suffocation of the industrialized world, not excluding the invasion of Saudi Arabia to take over the oil wells.
[01:50:00.637 --> 01:50:06.398]   And some of the announcements of the invasion in hand, Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon,
[01:50:06.398 --> 01:50:12.837]   they struck a deal with the House of Saud, a deal which gave birth to the so-called petrodollar system.
[01:50:12.837 --> 01:50:14.318]  And the terms, again, were very simple.
[01:50:14.318 --> 01:50:21.278]   The Saudis agreed to only accept U.S. dollars in return for their oil and that they would reinvest
[01:50:21.278 --> 01:50:24.077]  their surplus dollars into the U.S. Treasury.
[01:50:24.077 --> 01:50:24.917]  It's a perfect deal.
[01:50:24.917 --> 01:50:29.077]   And in return, the United States would provide arms and security guarantees to the Saudis,
[01:50:29.077 --> 01:50:32.957]   who, well, it has to be said, we're living in a pretty rough New England.
[01:50:32.957 --> 01:50:35.877]  There's no Saudis purchase of treasuries, U.S.
[01:50:35.970 --> 01:50:39.514]  treasuries, grew along with the oil price and everybody was happy.
[01:50:40.114 --> 01:50:44.578]  And so having the world's most vital commodity exclusively priced in U.S.
[01:50:44.618 --> 01:50:51.385]  dollars, I'm talking about oil, meant that everybody in the world needed to hold large dollar reserves to pay for it.
[01:50:52.006 --> 01:50:53.847]  That meant a huge bid for the treasuries.
[01:50:54.693 --> 01:51:05.122]  But by 2015, there were treasuries of the value of around six years of total global oil supply in the hands of the foreigners, which wasn't really a good deal for the rest of the world.
[01:51:05.963 --> 01:51:17.554]   And so these agreements, Alex, consolidated the purchasing power of the United States currency, thus creating A bigger and more liquid market for the United States Dollar and the United States Treasuries.
[01:51:17.594 --> 01:51:31.579]  And so the United States also obtained a unique privilege to import goods, including oil, using their own currency, which they can simply print, you know, with a little machine that unfortunately United don't have, unlike other countries that needed to buy it.
[01:51:32.379 --> 01:51:38.382]  And so the petrodollar system allowed the government and the American citizens to live beyond their means for decades.
[01:51:38.982 --> 01:51:39.763]  And that's over!
[01:51:40.283 --> 01:51:40.583]  Okay?
[01:51:40.623 --> 01:51:46.488]  There's another aspect to it as well, which I think it's important to explain to people, and it relates to the Bilderberg Group.
[01:51:46.988 --> 01:51:52.813]  You see, in May 1973, the Bilderberg Group met at an exclusive resort in Salzbaden in Sweden.
[01:51:53.493 --> 01:52:14.249]   And so certain elites, connected with the money center banks in New York, well, they decided it was time for a major shock to reverse the direction of the global economy, even at the cost Of recession in the American economy that didn't concern them so much as long as they were in control of the money flows because again I repeat The American economists, they're not American.
[01:52:14.289 --> 01:52:14.869]  They're globalists.
[01:52:14.889 --> 01:52:16.090]  They don't care about the United States.
[01:52:16.711 --> 01:52:39.029]   And so the the the Egypt-Israeli war Was in fact used as a kind of a pretext for an oil embargo against the United States and other nations who supported Israel and the key point Of that Bilderberg meeting agenda was the oil shock of 1973, which was a 400% targeted increase in the price of oil, OPEC oil, in the near future.
[01:52:39.569 --> 01:52:41.490]  And they discussed it at the Bilderberg Conference.
[01:52:41.810 --> 01:52:42.931]  And we saw the documents.
[01:52:43.211 --> 01:52:58.185]   And so the entire discussion at the time Well, it's not how we, as the world's most powerful representatives of the world's industrial nations, can convince the Arab OPEC countries not to increase oil prices so dramatically.
[01:52:58.245 --> 01:53:08.533]  Instead, what the bankers talked about, what do we do with all the Petri dollars that will come inevitably to London and to New York banks from the Arab OPEC oil revenue?
[01:53:09.542 --> 01:53:19.205]  And all of that, Alex, was aimed at continuing the systemic imperial process of looting the actual productive wealth of the major nations of the planet.
[01:53:19.225 --> 01:53:29.308]  And the oil hoax, because that's what it was, ultimately created an enormous volume of wealth transfer nominally into the OPEC countries, the so-called petrodollar.
[01:53:29.768 --> 01:53:37.111]  But the money went to London, the money went to Wall Street to be managed, because obviously the Arab sheikhs are not going to put it under a tree, you know, in the middle of their desert.
[01:53:37.791 --> 01:53:41.734]  And that's the financial allergy in these major financial centers.
[01:53:41.774 --> 01:53:51.421]  They use the old price hoax to establish an absolute domination over the world's credit system and also to make sure it no longer went to civil and cultural development.
[01:53:51.961 --> 01:53:53.442]  And so again, the oil price jumping 400%.
[01:53:55.043 --> 01:54:00.647]  In the 1973-1974 period, it saved the dollar as a financial entity.
[01:54:00.687 --> 01:54:03.029]  It saved Wall Street, but not the U.S.
[01:54:03.089 --> 01:54:04.150]  economy by any means.
[01:54:04.750 --> 01:54:08.313]  And the price shock halted growth in Europe, as we're seeing right now.
[01:54:08.413 --> 01:54:17.220]  It smashed the industrialization of the developing countries in the third world, which were enjoying a rapid growth by the early 1970s as a result of cheap oil.
[01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:21.984]  And it also tilted the power balance back into the direction of Wall Street and the dollar system.
[01:54:22.564 --> 01:54:34.207]   So you see the The oil market is controlled, again, not by OPEC, but by the British Empire through its dominance over the oil giant companies which make up the international oil cartel.
[01:54:34.227 --> 01:54:46.670]  And these companies, and people, most people don't know this, which control transportation and processing, distribution of petroleum products, they control the physical size of the oil business while the price is set through the financial markets.
[01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:53.165]   And this This arrangement, Alex, allows the price to move independently of supply and demand.
[01:54:53.205 --> 01:54:54.506]  It has been of great benefit.
[01:54:55.066 --> 01:54:57.167]  And by the way, I'm glad you're doing this history.
[01:54:57.187 --> 01:55:00.449]  You give the best quick history on our whole world and how it's set up.
[01:55:01.229 --> 01:55:04.151]  And these parasites hurting the world economy get even more control now.
[01:55:04.631 --> 01:55:06.812]  They're 2.0 is the great reset, build back better.
[01:55:06.832 --> 01:55:11.875]  So now with this being threatened, take your time to describe where we are now or finish up with your history where we are now.
[01:55:11.935 --> 01:55:17.617]  And then now this shift, what will these power groups do with the greatest threat in their history?
[01:55:17.637 --> 01:55:20.459]  I think the answer is total war and so much more.
[01:55:20.499 --> 01:55:26.061]  So we really are coming to the crossroads, the event horizon, or the point of no return.
[01:55:26.081 --> 01:55:28.743]  I think it's already been crossed into the end of the dollar.
[01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:34.339]  So what will those death throes look like, or how will these globalists try to maintain control, Daniel Estlin?
[01:55:35.623 --> 01:55:55.146]  Well, again, one of the reasons for, you know, a bit of a history is that we have to understand that these petrodollars, we're talking about, you know, the previous market, when you combine it with the proceeds of the British Empire's drug trade, they were absolutely instrumental in restructuring Wall Street in the 1970s, then paving the way for the junk bongs of the 1980s, and also the derivatives of the 1990s.
[01:55:55.607 --> 01:56:02.108]  And so the deep state used the oil hoax to fund operations to transform the United States from within.
[01:56:02.128 --> 01:56:03.328]  That's important to understand.
[01:56:03.908 --> 01:56:05.689]  Because the United States has been transformed.
[01:56:05.709 --> 01:56:20.458]  It's like Darth Vader, which wasn't Darth Vader in the beginning, but has been transformed into this Darth Vader from within, including the takeover of the United States banking system, the cartelization under the euphemism of mergers and acquisitions of corporate America.
[01:56:20.898 --> 01:56:24.100]  And so Wall Street was transformed into this giant casino.
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:30.346]  Well, betting on financial instruments replaced, you know, real investing in the real sector of the economy.
[01:56:30.426 --> 01:56:33.329]  And the connection to reality was totally severed.
[01:56:33.569 --> 01:56:35.551]  And this is what we're seeing the consequences of that today.
[01:56:35.852 --> 01:56:36.593]  And at the same time...
[01:56:38.238 --> 01:56:44.959]  The petrodollar system helped fund cultural warfare operations against American people, and we're seeing the consequences of that today.
[01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:48.680]  Okay, to keep America blind to the damage being done to the country.
[01:56:48.980 --> 01:57:00.223]  And so all this stuff we're seeing about LGBT++++, all these, you know, liberal degeneracies the world over, all this Nazi feminism, this is the consequences of what happened back then.
[01:57:00.783 --> 01:57:05.944]  And so there's this enormous financial ripoff that has been used by the Empire.
[01:57:06.804 --> 01:57:08.885]  To run the assault in the takeover of the world.
[01:57:09.266 --> 01:57:12.668]  And the effect of this assault is now becoming obvious.
[01:57:12.928 --> 01:57:14.329]  And the financial bubble has popped.
[01:57:14.349 --> 01:57:17.051]  We're talking about a four quadrillion dollar bubble.
[01:57:17.631 --> 01:57:17.891]  Okay?
[01:57:17.931 --> 01:57:27.318]  This great financial engine that was supposed to replace industry as the economic engine of the future has been shown to be substantial, you know, as the emperor's new clause, which means it doesn't exist.
[01:57:28.118 --> 01:57:38.224]  And so now we're left with a bankrupt banking system sitting on top of this rusted hulk of an economy dependent upon the world's company cartels for many of the necessities of life.
[01:57:38.264 --> 01:57:44.928]  So progress and development was absolutely destroyed at the expense of monetary cartels in control of the world's economy.
[01:57:44.948 --> 01:57:48.971]  Except that, that model is on its deathbed.
[01:57:49.844 --> 01:57:51.366]  Okay, it can't expand anymore.
[01:57:51.386 --> 01:57:55.730]  It can't go any further than that because we've reached the limits of growth on the planet Earth.
[01:57:56.311 --> 01:57:58.253]  And so the elite is saying, so what are we going to do now?
[01:57:58.313 --> 01:58:00.936]  Well, global thermonuclear war sounds like a good plan.
[01:58:01.596 --> 01:58:02.958]  Because you can destroy and start again.
[01:58:02.978 --> 01:58:06.381]  So for them to kill four or five billion people, again, we've talked about this before.
[01:58:07.256 --> 01:58:07.976]  It's no big deal.
[01:58:08.216 --> 01:58:13.978]  And that's why they're saying LGBT is much more important than a global thermonuclear war as a subject of the conversation.
[01:58:14.658 --> 01:58:16.079]  Green energy is a lot more important.
[01:58:16.099 --> 01:58:17.659]  Global warming is a lot more important.
[01:58:18.339 --> 01:58:19.439]  A lot more important than what?
[01:58:19.459 --> 01:58:21.100]  Than killing four or five billion people?
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:23.861]  Well, according to the lead, yeah, exactly.
[01:58:24.401 --> 01:58:25.461]  And that's what we're seeing right now.
[01:58:25.501 --> 01:58:33.923]   And that's why, again, a bit of a run through the history of the petrodollar system is it helps you to understand How the thing was structured.
[01:58:33.963 --> 01:58:34.963]  Okay, so that was there.
[01:58:35.403 --> 01:58:36.123]  Okay, that's over.
[01:58:36.904 --> 01:58:46.708]  And so after the official confirmation of the expiration of the oil, Saudi Arabia, as of now, basically will be free to sell oil at any currency it wants, including cryptocurrency.
[01:58:46.748 --> 01:58:51.470]  And obviously this means the departure from the domination of the US dollar in the world economy.
[01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:55.712]  But again, this is just one of the several interesting aspects happening globally.
[01:58:56.312 --> 01:59:09.782]   Days before the oil deal expired, Saudi Arabia also announced, Alex, It's participation in what's called Project Enbridge, which is a project that explores a digital currency platform involving multiple central banks.
[01:59:09.822 --> 01:59:17.749]  And it's built on distributed ledger technology called DLT, allowing instant settlement of cross-border payments and also foreign exchange transaction.
[01:59:17.789 --> 01:59:27.464]   And Project Enbridge, this is a new, this was launched back in 2021 between the central banks of China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates.
[01:59:27.564 --> 01:59:32.627]  And the project has now over 26 observer participants, amongst them South African Reserve Bank.
[01:59:32.987 --> 01:59:35.429]  And then of course there's Russia and China, let's not forget about them.
[01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:43.174]  They're trying to launch BRICS currency and they want Saudi Arabia to join this currency, especially after Saudi Arabia joined BRICS.
[01:59:43.214 --> 01:59:46.516]  And they wanted it to back the currency with gold.
[01:59:47.492 --> 01:59:51.577]  Which means that gold will become an object of demand if the new currency is launched.
[01:59:52.017 --> 01:59:54.120]  Which means that the gold is not going to be $2,300, but may go to $3,500, $4,000, $5,000 an ounce.
[01:59:54.140 --> 01:59:58.220]   out of dollars, but may go to three and a half, four or $5,000 an ounce.
[01:59:58.220 --> 02:00:03.579]   And again, it'll be several years before the US dollar loses its dominant position.
[02:00:03.579 --> 02:00:07.020]  But again, we are inevitably witnessing the decline.
[02:00:07.020 --> 02:00:09.820]   Okay, the beginning of the end of the Washington led global order.
[02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:11.780]  And that's why they need a panicking Alex.
[02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:14.220]  And that's why they want people like you out of the way.
[02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:17.740]   Okay, because you shine the light of truth on what they're doing on their transgressions.
[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:20.440]  And they don't like that because they have no way out.
[02:00:21.079 --> 02:00:23.160]  (coughs)
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:26.240]  Daniel, I'm just giving you the floor.
[02:00:25.533 --> 02:00:26.794]  This is incredibly important history.
[02:00:26.854 --> 02:00:27.495]  It's all dead on.
[02:00:27.515 --> 02:00:28.457]  You do a great job doing it.
[02:00:29.238 --> 02:00:30.940]  And so now we're here at this moment.
[02:00:31.381 --> 02:00:32.823]  There's so many facets to this.
[02:00:33.143 --> 02:00:33.624]  But you're right.
[02:00:34.124 --> 02:00:38.806]   Once they did that in the late 70s, and moved us away from the real economy.
[02:00:38.806 --> 02:00:43.087]   Once we were disconnected from reality, they could just add any la-la land they wanted.
[02:00:43.087 --> 02:00:44.027]  It's done on purpose.
[02:00:44.027 --> 02:00:45.046]  Two men can have a baby.
[02:00:45.046 --> 02:00:46.606]  Two women can have a baby in prison.
[02:00:46.606 --> 02:00:48.447]  No, it's a man and a woman's prison.
[02:00:48.447 --> 02:00:49.287]  You know, pedophilia.
[02:00:49.287 --> 02:00:52.646]   All this is meant to make us just give up on reality because now they're bringing in
[02:00:52.646 --> 02:00:53.846]  the central bank digital currencies.
[02:00:53.846 --> 02:00:56.926]   They're bringing in the ESGs, the corporate governances over behavior,
[02:00:56.926 --> 02:01:00.046]  the social credit score, the total disconnection.
[02:01:00.046 --> 02:01:02.646]  Why are they so powerful and own everything?
[02:01:02.646 --> 02:01:04.567]  Would they not wanna just have prosperity and move forward?
[02:01:04.567 --> 02:01:08.006]  Why do they have to take full control of human life?
[02:01:08.006 --> 02:01:09.606]  Because they're transhumanists.
[02:01:09.606 --> 02:01:10.867]  I know you're an expert on that.
[02:01:10.867 --> 02:01:12.627]  You've written bestselling books on that.
[02:01:12.627 --> 02:01:17.606]   And I'm gonna be listening to you as I literally drive home to pack my bags
[02:01:18.244 --> 02:01:18.744]  I haven't done it yet.
[02:01:18.784 --> 02:01:22.967]  I get on a plane to go to a very important event that will be on the news in the next 24 hours.
[02:01:23.307 --> 02:01:25.268]  I'll stop there, but I'm very honored to have you here.
[02:01:25.608 --> 02:01:27.830]  So you've got as long as you want, but you said 30 minutes.
[02:01:28.330 --> 02:01:28.830]  30 minutes left.
[02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:29.631]  You've got the floor.
[02:01:29.931 --> 02:01:34.274]   You're hosting right now, but you're also a very Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:01:34.453 --> 02:01:38.014]   and you never promote yourself, people should go to estelin.media
[02:01:38.014 --> 02:01:42.653]   for all your key analysis and stuff that's too hot for the general internet, estelin.media
[02:01:42.653 --> 02:01:48.893]   and on X at estelinVZ, estelinVZ, and we'll be putting those on screen.
[02:01:48.893 --> 02:01:53.753]   Daniel Estelin, you've got the floor, you're hosting, I'm listening, God bless, please continue.
[02:01:53.753 --> 02:01:54.653]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:01:54.653 --> 02:01:58.253]   And anyway, so one of the things that people have to understand
[02:01:58.253 --> 02:02:05.173]   is what we're seeing right now, Again, this is the LGBT plus, whatever they call it month.
[02:01:59.398 --> 02:02:04.823]  Is, uh, what we're seeing right now, again, this is the LGBT+, whatever they call it, month.
[02:02:05.443 --> 02:02:05.784]  Okay?
[02:02:06.044 --> 02:02:08.086]  There's a reason why you have that.
[02:02:08.726 --> 02:02:08.966]  Okay?
[02:02:08.986 --> 02:02:11.068]  These aren't, like, some crazy, wacky conspiracy.
[02:02:11.128 --> 02:02:15.232]  It has nothing to do with human rights, protecting, you know, homosexual community.
[02:02:15.532 --> 02:02:16.032]  From whom?
[02:02:16.052 --> 02:02:18.555]  Who are you protecting these people from?
[02:02:19.395 --> 02:02:20.837]  If anything, we need protection.
[02:02:21.397 --> 02:02:22.658]  They're after our children.
[02:02:22.698 --> 02:02:24.199]  They want to rape our children.
[02:02:24.219 --> 02:02:25.821]  They want to have sex with our children.
[02:02:28.464 --> 02:02:33.507]  So again, if we look at it from, you know, from a certain vantage point, what are we talking about?
[02:02:33.547 --> 02:02:35.668]  Well, COVID was about the Great Reset.
[02:02:36.848 --> 02:02:42.991]  But if we analyze what the Great Reset is, and we'll kind of take that string and, you know, and move it forward, extrapolate it into the future.
[02:02:43.992 --> 02:02:51.656]  Suddenly all this, you know, I don't know how to say this, ravages of liberalism become easy to understand.
[02:02:52.745 --> 02:02:56.869]  So if we analyze Great Reset from that vantage point, what is it?
[02:02:56.949 --> 02:03:03.214]  It's a new course for humanity, according to the liberal banking financiers and globalists.
[02:03:04.335 --> 02:03:19.769]  Because, again, if we eliminate the humanistic claptrap and this gooey emphasis on ecology, on loving children, of course a love of a child by a parent is not the same love of a child by a homosexual or a pedophile.
[02:03:21.462 --> 02:03:45.761]  But if we eliminate all that extra claptrap, then the program of this new phase of globalization and the plan of action of the international elite, especially in this Biden era, and we've seen what his son does, and if Biden is proud of his son, Jesus Christ, Hunter Biden is the worst kind of a human being I could ever imagine.
[02:03:46.241 --> 02:03:51.739]   If I'm a father of a Hunter Biden, I prefer to kill myself than to have a son like that.
[02:03:53.681 --> 02:03:55.562]  This is a degenerate pedophile.
[02:03:58.065 --> 02:04:00.867]  And Joe Biden is proud of his son.
[02:04:01.948 --> 02:04:24.255]   But anyway, if we kind of look at it conceptually, what all this stuff boils down to about Biden in this period of time, globalists believe that the arrival of the Democrats to the White House Creates the perfect conditions for a new round of globalization and the implementation of the original program.
[02:04:26.075 --> 02:04:37.220]  Mind you, globalization is on its way out and the alternative multipolar world order, as they call it, although it's kind of a silly word, multipolar, if you take a battery, an alkaline AA battery, how many poles do you have?
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:39.021]  Multipoles, but you have plus, minus two.
[02:04:40.362 --> 02:04:42.162]  Anyway, let's call it multipolar because that's what they call it.
[02:04:42.182 --> 02:04:43.283]  We don't want to confuse people more.
[02:04:45.373 --> 02:04:53.237]  So if globalization is on its way out, and you have this alternative, multipolar world order, based on what?
[02:04:53.678 --> 02:05:01.702]  Based on the rise of independent civilization, whether we're talking about the Russian, the Chinese, the Islamic, is vying for its place in the sun.
[02:05:03.123 --> 02:05:08.806]  And so liberalism, to be relevant, needs an alternative economic model.
[02:05:09.766 --> 02:05:12.208]  It needs an alternative economic language.
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:17.843]  An alternative model or language that does not exist at this time.
[02:05:19.804 --> 02:05:23.327]  And it does not exist because we don't have a theory of post-systemic crisis.
[02:05:25.748 --> 02:05:27.029]  I know Biden doesn't understand this.
[02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:31.132]  Most of the people in the government has no idea what this means.
[02:05:31.192 --> 02:05:33.374]  But there are some people who are smart enough who do understand.
[02:05:35.876 --> 02:05:37.717]  These are the people who run things from behind the scenes.
[02:05:39.338 --> 02:05:40.719]  I'm not talking about Tony Blinken.
[02:05:40.739 --> 02:05:42.040]  I'm not talking about any of these people.
[02:05:42.580 --> 02:05:43.341]  They're shit for brains.
[02:05:45.051 --> 02:05:55.519]  And so if we look at the main stages in the formation of liberal ideology, the Great Reset, is not something accidental and transitory.
[02:05:55.559 --> 02:06:01.243]  Globalization is the logical result of oral history as understood by liberal thought.
[02:06:03.225 --> 02:06:11.831]  Because you see, liberalism is an ideology that prioritizes the liberation of the individual from all forms of collective identity.
[02:06:14.588 --> 02:06:20.312]  And it began with the Protestant Reformation, abolition of the medieval state or strata of society.
[02:06:20.332 --> 02:06:30.978]  And so as a result, a bourgeois society emerged in which everyone was absolutely equal, but only in theory and in terms of opportunities.
[02:06:31.999 --> 02:06:35.141]  But you see, in the eyes of the liberals, well, this was great progress.
[02:06:35.801 --> 02:06:43.046]  And whatever was left of the European empires and the power of the Pope at the time, modern nation states arose again, individuals.
[02:06:44.011 --> 02:06:49.816]  Only in the form of states were freed from collective identity, which was Catholic and Imperial.
[02:06:50.977 --> 02:06:52.878]  But the liberal progress did not stop there.
[02:06:53.098 --> 02:06:55.320]  So you have, for example, philosophers Locke and Kant.
[02:06:56.020 --> 02:07:01.885]  They described the project of what's called civil society, in which nation states were to be abolished.
[02:07:02.906 --> 02:07:07.169]  And so in theory, individuals could do without them.
[02:07:07.850 --> 02:07:10.592]  And thus arose the philosophy of cosmopolitanism.
[02:07:11.465 --> 02:07:12.246]  Which implies what?
[02:07:12.286 --> 02:07:17.235]  The abolition of nation states and ideally the creation of world government.
[02:07:18.577 --> 02:07:21.482]  And this in fact was the birth of globalism, albeit in theory.
[02:07:21.502 --> 02:07:22.644]  And then you have Adam Smith.
[02:07:23.848 --> 02:07:31.236]  Who formulated the foundation of liberalism economics, pointing out the international nature of the market.
[02:07:31.977 --> 02:07:39.946]  And so the development of capitalism, in this liberal theory, assume the gradual disappearance of the states, and in the end, what do you have?
[02:07:39.966 --> 02:07:42.548]  You have complete replacement of politics by the economy.
[02:07:42.568 --> 02:07:43.810]  In other words, by the market.
[02:07:45.126 --> 02:07:54.211]  And in the 19th century, Marxism and its critical theory merged, which literally juxtaposed liberal individualism to a theory of classes.
[02:07:55.351 --> 02:08:01.634]  And Marxism also agreed on the need for the extinction of the states, in other words, internationalism.
[02:08:03.495 --> 02:08:10.926]   So we come to the 20th century, and so you have the ideology of extreme nationalism or fascism, That was boring.
[02:08:11.486 --> 02:08:14.509]  Challenging both liberalism on the one hand and communism on the other.
[02:08:15.289 --> 02:08:22.295]  And so at the forefront they put the principle of the nation, the state for the Nazis, race for the National Socialists.
[02:08:23.276 --> 02:08:34.566]  And then the defeat of fascism back in 1945 removed this ideology from the agenda and the image of the future was contested between liberals on the one hand and communists on the other.
[02:08:35.649 --> 02:08:39.070]  And this was the ideological meaning of the Cold War, okay?
[02:08:39.291 --> 02:08:41.331]  Liberalism on the one hand and communism on the other.
[02:08:41.752 --> 02:08:49.355]  And that lasted from 1946 to, some say 1981, 1999, the fall of the Berlin Wall, or you can take 1991, the fall of the Soviet Union.
[02:08:50.774 --> 02:09:02.534]   follow the Berlin Wall, or you can take 1991, the fall of the Soviet Union. And so in 1991, the liberal West finally won. The United States collapsed and communist
[02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:07.792]  The United States collapsed and Communist China embarked on the path of this free market economy, albeit with Chinese specificity.
[02:09:08.492 --> 02:09:18.016]  And it was then that the end of history by Francis Fukuyama was proclaimed, in other words, the final victory of liberalism over all other isms.
[02:09:19.070 --> 02:09:20.050]  But there was a problem.
[02:09:20.811 --> 02:09:27.973]  Because upon closer examination, it turned out that liberals have not quite abolished two types of collective identities.
[02:09:28.073 --> 02:09:31.874]  One is sexual, which is gender, and the other one is human proper.
[02:09:33.634 --> 02:09:37.655]  And this means that liberal progress needed to address new obstacles.
[02:09:38.476 --> 02:09:41.997]  And that's why gender politics has come to the forefront since the 1990s and the 20th century.
[02:09:44.229 --> 02:09:45.570]  Okay, this is not an accident.
[02:09:45.590 --> 02:09:47.591]  You have to understand this is not an accident.
[02:09:48.332 --> 02:09:52.154]  And it has nothing to do with protecting the rights of the poor homosexuals.
[02:09:52.174 --> 02:09:53.535]  It has nothing to do with that.
[02:09:55.496 --> 02:10:02.421]  Because from a global conceptual perspective of people who run and control the world, it goes beyond that.
[02:10:02.441 --> 02:10:04.802]  They couldn't care less about these people.
[02:10:06.063 --> 02:10:09.105]  And as soon as they don't need them anymore, they're going to kill them from first to last.
[02:10:11.052 --> 02:10:21.017]  But it's meaning is, again, not just tolerance towards perverts and radical feminists, again, restoring this alleged gender identity or equality.
[02:10:22.077 --> 02:10:27.260]  Because sex as gender should become, according to liberal progressives, a matter of individual choice.
[02:10:28.961 --> 02:10:32.062]  On par with religion, profession, nationality, etc., etc.
[02:10:32.122 --> 02:10:35.024]  Otherwise, progress will slow down, according to them.
[02:10:36.738 --> 02:10:45.002]  And so henceforth you have this exaggerated emphasis on both transgender people and gay couples in the Biden administration.
[02:10:45.202 --> 02:10:46.242]  Again, it's not an accident.
[02:10:47.663 --> 02:10:54.506]  If we analyze this, if we break this down to what it is, to the lowest common denominator, that's what it is, that's what we're looking at.
[02:10:56.467 --> 02:11:03.731]  And so today democracy has literally come to be defined as the rule of minorities against the majority.
[02:11:04.608 --> 02:11:11.412]  Which is kind of a deliberately criminal majority, criminal in quotes, at any time under the influence of populist sentiments.
[02:11:12.352 --> 02:11:17.435]  Again, you know, they say majority meaning someone like Donald Trump or someone like Hitler.
[02:11:18.656 --> 02:11:24.819]  And so Trump tried to defend the old understanding of democracy, but he was overthrown.
[02:11:25.699 --> 02:11:27.560]  He was cancelled, literally cancelled.
[02:11:27.580 --> 02:11:30.582]  And that's what the cancel culture is all about.
[02:11:31.687 --> 02:11:38.010]  It was cancelled like so many other people, figures, movements, entire countries that are on the path of this great reset.
[02:11:38.050 --> 02:11:42.113]  The last stage of this movement of liberalism towards its historical triumph.
[02:11:44.514 --> 02:11:51.177]  And so, the final stage for the liberals is the abolition of humanity.
[02:11:51.197 --> 02:11:53.258]  In other words, the politics of post-humanism.
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:57.160]  Going back to what Alex talked about at the beginning.
[02:11:57.180 --> 02:11:59.782]  So we go from humanity, trans-humanity, post-humanity.
[02:12:00.754 --> 02:12:06.095]  And so the liberation of collective identity requires the abolition of species.
[02:12:07.295 --> 02:12:09.016]  Understand what I'm trying to say.
[02:12:10.016 --> 02:12:15.577]  The abolition of species is what we're seeing right now, which is why they don't really care about killing 4 billion of us.
[02:12:18.317 --> 02:12:23.458]  They need to cancel the human species and create something else, post-human, trans-human, post-human.
[02:12:24.738 --> 02:12:27.379]  Something that could be easily programmed by them.
[02:12:29.594 --> 02:12:32.937]  And so if you have gay couples, you can have children, which means you can reduce the population.
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:44.368]  And so these liberal futurists, they're already praising and salivating of the possibilities of what post-humanism is all about.
[02:12:44.388 --> 02:12:51.935]  Now it's fusion with the machine, with this great enhancement of body strength, memory, heightened sensations.
[02:12:53.319 --> 02:12:56.940]  We're talking about genetic engineering, which will help end disease according to them.
[02:12:57.260 --> 02:12:59.301]  Memory can be stored in a server in the cloud.
[02:13:01.702 --> 02:13:14.886]  And so, humanity, if you listen to Kurzweil, or if you listen to Harari, or Klaus Schwab, isn't it great, they say, that we'll be able to connect with a machine and achieve immortality?
[02:13:15.807 --> 02:13:16.927]  What kind of immortality?
[02:13:16.987 --> 02:13:18.268]  Cybernetic immortality.
[02:13:18.388 --> 02:13:22.069]  In other words, you can live as an image on the computer screen.
[02:13:23.447 --> 02:13:27.630]  So you're counseling God.
[02:13:28.890 --> 02:13:37.276]  In other words, the Great Reset is the triumph of liberal ideology at its highest stage, which is the stage of globalization.
[02:13:38.596 --> 02:13:43.379]  And all those who do not agree with such an agenda are declared what enemies of open societies.
[02:13:43.679 --> 02:13:45.881]  And that's where, what's his name, Soros comes in.
[02:13:47.882 --> 02:13:51.044]  And these people are encouraged to voluntarily surrender.
[02:13:51.664 --> 02:14:12.911]   Otherwise, Ursula von der Leyen and all these other people that said the whole progressive world will turn against them with its unlimited finances, military technical potential, and its inexhaustible ability to control the imagination of humanity via mind control, MKUltra, etc, etc.
[02:14:16.834 --> 02:14:22.537]  And so therefore the Great Reset is the last rung of human progress as understood by what?
[02:14:22.617 --> 02:14:23.698]  By liberal thought.
[02:14:25.526 --> 02:14:28.447]  And now that all humanity has literally been liberated.
[02:14:30.647 --> 02:14:32.847]  All humanity, thanks to the liberals, is now free.
[02:14:32.967 --> 02:14:33.848]  Free of what?
[02:14:33.968 --> 02:14:35.108]  Free to be a liberal.
[02:14:37.608 --> 02:14:38.508]  There's no freedom.
[02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:40.489]  We are free to be a liberal.
[02:14:40.529 --> 02:14:42.389]  We are free to be what they want us to be.
[02:14:44.169 --> 02:14:46.730]  And if you're anything other than that, you will be cancelled.
[02:14:48.630 --> 02:14:52.211]  But again, keep in mind that at the same time, society is not free not to be a liberal.
[02:14:53.553 --> 02:14:56.496]  It is not free not to believe anything that they do not want you to believe.
[02:14:59.358 --> 02:15:12.930]  And if somewhere this illiberal, I just made up a word, or insufficiently liberal person is found, then the punish system, the cancel culture, is activated against this individual.
[02:15:13.491 --> 02:15:15.993]  Not a human being, no, any being.
[02:15:17.414 --> 02:15:20.377]  Because we've been degraded, we've been lowered and wronged.
[02:15:21.181 --> 02:15:24.003]  In its evolution and evolutionary process.
[02:15:25.985 --> 02:15:33.591]  Because for the true liberals, talking about Justin Trudeau and company, I'm not a human being, Alex Jones is not a human being.
[02:15:35.312 --> 02:15:40.056]  I don't think they even consider us to be a being, never mind a human being.
[02:15:42.587 --> 02:15:44.729]  And for them, for these people, we are a zero.
[02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:51.296]  This infinite black hole squared, discarded, banished to the distant space of the netherworld.
[02:15:54.919 --> 02:16:06.310]  And so, again, joking aside, or facetiousness aside, we are at a critical stage that will determine the direction of the world.
[02:16:07.950 --> 02:16:09.370]  The direction of humanity.
[02:16:09.470 --> 02:16:12.871]  Are we to become or remain homo sapiens or something else?
[02:16:15.272 --> 02:16:17.132]  We talked about this a couple of weeks ago on the show.
[02:16:21.393 --> 02:16:24.634]  We don't want to create a new species with limited cognitive abilities.
[02:16:25.154 --> 02:16:27.115]  And again, much is at stake for the liberals.
[02:16:28.415 --> 02:16:43.602]   Because they're well aware that if, okay, if their defeats and failures continue to pile up, Then the entire 500 more or less year history of liberalism will collapse with it.
[02:16:45.462 --> 02:16:57.225]  And so this multipolar world to which Putin himself intuitively gravitates, directly criticizing the voracious parasitical globalization.
[02:16:59.345 --> 02:17:02.726]  It leaves the liberals without a single chance of success.
[02:17:04.932 --> 02:17:05.973]  And so what have they done?
[02:17:06.013 --> 02:17:07.734]  Well, they've removed their masks.
[02:17:09.635 --> 02:17:20.301]  They've abandoned their play along principles of participatory democracy, where you can vote, freedom of speech, freedom of human rights, all this other nonsense.
[02:17:22.323 --> 02:17:24.864]  It's not because it's nonsense, it's because they don't believe in any of this stuff.
[02:17:27.065 --> 02:17:30.808]  Callousness to the nth degree.
[02:17:31.877 --> 02:17:33.498]  And so they removed all that stuff.
[02:17:33.558 --> 02:17:38.202]  You know, they told you about human rights, freedom of speech, democracy, you know, the cornerstone of the West.
[02:17:39.063 --> 02:17:41.725]  And then COVID started, they said, you know all the other stuff we told you about?
[02:17:41.745 --> 02:17:42.986]  Well, it's bullshit.
[02:17:43.946 --> 02:17:46.448]  I mean, they needed to play along when the Soviet Union existed.
[02:17:47.429 --> 02:17:48.109]  They had no choice.
[02:17:50.411 --> 02:18:05.092]   Because if we the people were oppressed back when the Soviet Union existed, then maybe going back to the 50s, the 60s, the 70s, or later, People said, you know, we don't want this.
[02:18:06.573 --> 02:18:12.857]  And they would vote for the socialists and the communist parties in England and France and Germany and that was happening in Spain.
[02:18:14.598 --> 02:18:17.839]  And so the Western capitalists said, well, you know, we can't, we have to pretend, we just have to pretend.
[02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:21.622]  As long as the other system is out there, as long as people have a choice.
[02:18:24.303 --> 02:18:28.846]  We have to peddle human rights, freedom of speech, because the other, the Soviets, they don't have any of that.
[02:18:30.998 --> 02:18:31.538]  But we do.
[02:18:32.498 --> 02:18:33.498]  So we're going to sell them that.
[02:18:34.199 --> 02:18:36.539]  Freedom, rights, liberalism.
[02:18:38.559 --> 02:18:40.820]  And when the Soviet Union disappeared, there was no need to play along.
[02:18:42.380 --> 02:18:43.900]  And so they removed the masks.
[02:18:45.201 --> 02:18:49.701]  And so they abandoned this play along principles of participatory democracy.
[02:18:49.761 --> 02:18:53.842]  And they elected Joe Biden to be the President of the United States.
[02:18:54.922 --> 02:18:57.403]  Regardless of any decency or procedures or rules.
[02:18:57.443 --> 02:18:58.283]  Again, we saw that.
[02:19:00.393 --> 02:19:01.213]  We know what happened.
[02:19:02.994 --> 02:19:15.879]  And the Democrats, you know, driven by this logic of globalism, they were willing to sacrifice traditional American institutions, democracy itself, if you wish, to achieve their deep state globalist goals.
[02:19:18.060 --> 02:19:24.743]  But when they made it to the White House, they suddenly realized that it won't bring back the old glory.
[02:19:24.983 --> 02:19:39.031]   And because of this, no, Putin's speech, Or speeches in general, are even more powerful, not because Putin is a wonderful leader, but because what he's saying makes perfect sense.
[02:19:39.511 --> 02:19:40.732]  They're symbolic speeches.
[02:19:41.953 --> 02:19:47.438]  And he's been warning the West about the consequences of their actions, going back to the conference in Munich back in 2007.
[02:19:47.698 --> 02:20:04.898]   and so on. And I agree, as Alex said, some of this history is not easy to understand, but if you extract the actions of the elite and you don't put
[02:20:01.701 --> 02:20:10.808]  But if you extract the actions of the elite and you don't put it together in context, it's absolutely impossible to understand why things are being done the way they're done.
[02:20:12.750 --> 02:20:22.158]  And again, I agree it's not easy to understand the historical background of this liberal ideology which systematically leads to the destruction of humanity.
[02:20:23.513 --> 02:20:41.259]  And it's impossible to understand for those who have grown up in a humanistic society or system, but also for those who are educated under the influence of liberal democracy within the capitalist system and under the deep indoctrination of the globalist culture.
[02:20:42.759 --> 02:20:48.381]  And yet I think the epiphany began, you know, what's called the Great Awakening.
[02:20:50.233 --> 02:20:58.900]  And this slogan was first proposed by Donald Trump and his supporters who became the first victims of this looming neoliberal totalitarianism.
[02:21:01.142 --> 02:21:05.226]  And so, I want to remind you that their initiatives were immediately censored.
[02:21:06.387 --> 02:21:09.209]  Their social media accounts were immediately liquidated.
[02:21:10.430 --> 02:21:16.576]  Even their very existence was removed from the system of tech giants Twitter and YouTube, Google, Facebook, etc, etc.
[02:21:20.063 --> 02:21:29.067]  And again, initially, well this affected only the die-hard opponents of globalists, but I remind you of the last election.
[02:21:29.207 --> 02:21:36.910]  As the election campaign broke out, yet these ever-widening circles became victims of this cancel culture.
[02:21:37.850 --> 02:21:46.314]  Until finally these globalists applied their method, their modus operandi to the former President of the United States, Donald Trump, for the first time in history.
[02:21:51.064 --> 02:21:53.325]  And, of course, this was the moment of the Great Awakening.
[02:21:53.365 --> 02:21:54.885]  And now they're trying to do the same with Alex Jones.
[02:21:55.106 --> 02:21:57.066]  They're trying to steal his social media account.
[02:21:59.687 --> 02:22:01.288]  This is Great Awakening 2.0.
[02:22:01.568 --> 02:22:11.472]  And those who voted for Donald Trump are equated with fascists in the established liberal dictatorship.
[02:22:12.812 --> 02:22:17.914]  If you wear a MAGA hat, they punch you, they kick you, they spit at you, they throw you out of restaurants.
[02:22:19.827 --> 02:22:24.830]  You are unseemly, you are to be counseled, you are a Nazi, you are a fascist, you are a human scum.
[02:22:27.331 --> 02:22:30.352]  And this is how the laws of the Great Reset work.
[02:22:30.392 --> 02:22:34.114]  Whoever is not with us is a fascist.
[02:22:35.415 --> 02:22:43.379]  And since he's a fascist, we, the people, can act in the most cruel way with them without worrying about the consequences.
[02:22:43.599 --> 02:22:47.481]  So you see the state, okay?
[02:22:48.786 --> 02:22:50.966]  The grip of the jackboot.
[02:22:51.467 --> 02:22:52.447]  They have no need to do that.
[02:22:52.467 --> 02:22:59.728]  They're gonna let the people, our neighbors, our friends, our former friends, our colleagues, kill us.
[02:23:00.928 --> 02:23:04.029]  And then the state can stand aside and say, look, we have nothing to do with us.
[02:23:06.809 --> 02:23:07.089]  Okay?
[02:23:07.129 --> 02:23:12.571]  And this time, not only the true conservatives who have always had these ideological claims against liberals.
[02:23:13.031 --> 02:23:14.511]  They fell into this category.
[02:23:15.643 --> 02:23:30.449]  But also the liberals themselves, ordinary American citizens who however did not have time to reorganize under the new criteria of this progressive liberalism which in the name of progress cancels all who are not sufficiently liberal.
[02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:33.451]  So you have to prove yourself that you are a real liberal.
[02:23:35.232 --> 02:23:35.752]  What does that mean?
[02:23:35.812 --> 02:23:37.753]  It means you have to do harm to others.
[02:23:37.773 --> 02:23:40.774]  You have to destroy those who don't think like you do.
[02:23:42.115 --> 02:23:44.216]  There's no such thing as freedom of thought in the United States.
[02:23:44.236 --> 02:23:45.036]  It doesn't exist anymore.
[02:23:46.530 --> 02:23:49.571]  Because the freedom today is the freedom of minorities.
[02:23:50.452 --> 02:24:04.958]  And the parameters of this freedom, that is, what can be said and what can be done and what cannot be done, in other words, the norms of political correctness, are strictly established by a liberal elite.
[02:24:06.278 --> 02:24:10.180]  And obviously someone like Putin does not fit into these parameters in any way.
[02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:14.942]  Because Putin clearly speaks or spoke of the planetary awakening.
[02:24:16.420 --> 02:24:21.664]  Are part of this, let's call it, anthropological turn of greater part of the global village.
[02:24:24.126 --> 02:24:31.051]  And so, they call Putin dictator, murderer, all kinds of nasty things.
[02:24:32.532 --> 02:24:44.140]  And it's obvious that the place of Russia, at least Putin's Russia, a sovereign, independent and free Russia, is in the ranks of the great global awakening, along with Donald Trump.
[02:24:46.499 --> 02:25:01.110]  In other words, the Great Awakening is the confirmation that modern liberalism, in the stage of globalization, has become a true dictatorship.
[02:25:02.030 --> 02:25:13.639]  It has literally become a totalitarian ideology that rejects, like all totalitarianism, the right to have any point of view different from the dominant view of the minority.
[02:25:16.365 --> 02:25:33.941]  And so, these are obviously the early stages of this new civil war in the United States and the global war of meanings between the supporters of this Great Awakening versus the crazed supporters of the Great Reset.
[02:25:38.297 --> 02:25:43.706]  The architects of this great reset are determined to bring their ideological proposals to fruition.
[02:25:43.746 --> 02:25:49.455]  In fact, they've been trying to do this for over two decades, albeit without much success.
[02:25:49.535 --> 02:25:50.116]  Again, the 21st century.
[02:25:52.031 --> 02:25:55.352]  It began with September 11, then we had Putin in Munich in 2007.
[02:25:56.333 --> 02:25:58.374]  He put himself in the way of these globalists.
[02:25:58.694 --> 02:26:04.796]  Then we have the crisis of 2008, which was the beginning of the end of this particular economic model, Bretton Woods.
[02:26:05.476 --> 02:26:08.258]  Then we have China under Xi Jinping since 2013.
[02:26:08.318 --> 02:26:11.579]  Then we have Iran, then we have Turkey, then we have Donald Trump.
[02:26:12.779 --> 02:26:19.242]  And if the disruptions continue, then globalism runs the risk of collapsing onto itself completely.
[02:26:21.707 --> 02:26:23.848]  And so they're in our state right now.
[02:26:25.369 --> 02:26:27.629]  Well, the Great Reset is now or never.
[02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:51.692]   And this planetary liberal-oriented elite, both East and West, including, of course, a liberal elite in Russia, they're being mobilized by globalists to take an active part in this greed-safe project and overthrow This post-globalist anthropological turn.
[02:26:52.432 --> 02:27:03.054]  And this means that both an external and also internal fronts are opening up against the supporters of this multi-polarity, against sovereignty, against this poly-central world order.
[02:27:04.795 --> 02:27:13.717]  And the external pressure, it begins, needless to say, with Washington and NATO alliance, and spreads throughout the world via the sabotage of the fifth columns everywhere.
[02:27:14.631 --> 02:27:19.093]  In Russia, in China, in other parts of Europe, in the United States, obviously.
[02:27:21.134 --> 02:27:22.115]  And we're seeing it right now.
[02:27:24.936 --> 02:27:26.997]  Russian government is full of this fifth column.
[02:27:27.877 --> 02:27:29.538]  I think it's about time that Putin got rid of them.
[02:27:30.679 --> 02:27:36.721]  And then also, added to this is the start of this series of regime change operations the world over.
[02:27:36.941 --> 02:27:38.682]  A new wave of color revolutions.
[02:27:39.843 --> 02:27:43.965]  Manipulation of regional religious conflicts the world over.
[02:27:45.011 --> 02:27:50.073]  Whether we're talking about the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Far East, Africa, Latin America.
[02:27:51.314 --> 02:27:58.818]  And by the way, the religious axis is a fundamental element and is the third part, again, of this equation.
[02:28:00.298 --> 02:28:10.943]  In other words, the cause of Daesh or ISIS terrorists to destroy the churches in Europe is not an isolated act of the fanatical Islamist, you know, head-cutters.
[02:28:13.956 --> 02:28:19.019]  But a crucial element of this global liberalist all-out war against humanity.
[02:28:21.660 --> 02:28:23.841]  And that's something that you absolutely have to understand.
[02:28:23.881 --> 02:28:25.502]  And I think most people don't understand this.
[02:28:26.282 --> 02:28:30.684]  And the reason they don't understand this, because they take things... How do I say this?
[02:28:31.945 --> 02:28:39.549]  They take things... Individuals that break a hole into smaller bite-sized pieces.
[02:28:42.128 --> 02:28:42.948]  And you can't do that.
[02:28:43.549 --> 02:28:44.409]  It doesn't work like that.
[02:28:45.790 --> 02:28:48.632]  And so if you look at what we're seeing today, for example, where are we?
[02:28:49.792 --> 02:28:51.393]  We're in the post-modern world.
[02:28:54.195 --> 02:28:57.217]  Going back to what we talked earlier about, LGBT+.
[02:28:58.898 --> 02:29:01.960]  Again, if you think about this, this isn't something that Joe Biden thought of.
[02:29:04.301 --> 02:29:10.665]  This has profound, much deeper meaning of people who run the world and understand things conceptually.
[02:29:11.636 --> 02:29:14.657]  We're talking about Frankfurt School, we're talking about Tavistock Institute.
[02:29:14.677 --> 02:29:21.940]  So if you look at the human body from a postmodern point of view of this global, you know, liberalism.
[02:29:23.501 --> 02:29:30.544]  The human body obeys our brain and according to them that's a form of dictatorship.
[02:29:30.564 --> 02:29:38.127]  And so for postmodern world the goal to move the emphasis centered on the divine spark of reason.
[02:29:39.244 --> 02:29:41.605]  Dominance from hierarchy to pluralism.
[02:29:44.226 --> 02:29:45.307]  I'm not sure if we have a break.
[02:29:46.006 --> 02:29:47.066]  Okay, let's go on a break.
[02:29:47.066 --> 02:29:55.146]  Okay guys, so let's go on a break.
[02:29:53.550 --> 02:29:55.071]  Okay guys, so let's go to break.
[02:29:55.631 --> 02:29:59.353]  We're gonna be back in four minutes and we'll continue.
[02:30:02.363 --> 02:30:02.483]  2A 3.30 x (-0.00?)
[02:30:02.503 --> 02:30:16.503]  [Music]
[02:30:17.423 --> 02:30:17.923]  All right, folks.

[02:31:30.407 --> 02:31:31.247]  Sure.
[02:31:31.247 --> 02:31:35.487]  During COVID, I went there and I got the facial serum.

[02:33:00.503 --> 02:33:04.903]  And so, um, and so it's obvious, what we're seeing right now.
[02:33:00.458 --> 02:33:04.860]  And so it's obvious what we're seeing right now.
[02:33:04.920 --> 02:33:07.802]  The attack is directed against gender, as I said earlier.
[02:33:08.683 --> 02:33:11.604]  And so in the pre-modern times, gender was sacred.
[02:33:11.624 --> 02:33:15.806]  In other words, masculinity closer to God, femininity closer to the Earth.
[02:33:16.747 --> 02:33:20.129]  Modern put masculine and feminine on the same level.
[02:33:20.849 --> 02:33:21.750]  In other words, we're equal.
[02:33:21.790 --> 02:33:27.433]  So post-modern affirms that equal rights cannot exist for men and women, male and female.
[02:33:29.025 --> 02:33:31.046]  And in fact, again, we're looking at the dialectic.
[02:33:32.046 --> 02:33:40.129]  Postmodern affirms that we have to eliminate gender because the existence of gender is already a pre-modern, a patriarchal model.
[02:33:41.569 --> 02:33:51.093]  So according to them, the people behind all this Pride Day, LGBT++ movements, gender has to be like a nation of individual choices.
[02:33:52.048 --> 02:33:56.670]  Just like as human beings have the right to, for example, cross borders of different countries.
[02:33:56.730 --> 02:33:59.052]  People also have the right to change their sex.
[02:34:00.532 --> 02:34:02.674]  And not just once, but many, many, many, many times.
[02:34:05.935 --> 02:34:06.796]  Again, I insist.
[02:34:08.016 --> 02:34:09.757]  This isn't some wacky conspiracy theory.
[02:34:09.797 --> 02:34:11.398]  These people understand what they're doing.
[02:34:12.419 --> 02:34:14.400]  We don't understand because we have no clue.
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:18.662]  Because we're, you know, being brainwashed into believing all this nonsense.
[02:34:20.219 --> 02:34:34.448]  And so if you expand and extrapolate what these people are doing, the expansion of gender from too masculine-feminine, to I think infinity, I have no idea how many genders allegedly there are, because they keep inventing these new genders every single day.
[02:34:35.909 --> 02:34:48.638]   And everything that seemed absolutely unbreakable in the modern structure, that resulted from the process of liberation, From this transcendental verticality.
[02:34:49.619 --> 02:34:55.162]  All this in turn in the postmodern world is exposed to a deconstruction and change of meaning.
[02:34:56.463 --> 02:34:58.244]  And that's why I have this book right there.
[02:34:58.744 --> 02:34:59.645]  Transevolution.
[02:34:59.665 --> 02:35:00.825]  That book was published back in 2012.
[02:35:00.885 --> 02:35:04.227]  Transevolution.
[02:35:04.267 --> 02:35:06.609]  The coming age of human deconstruction.
[02:35:08.010 --> 02:35:09.470]  Started writing in about 2010.
[02:35:11.231 --> 02:35:11.632]  14 years ago.
[02:35:13.633 --> 02:35:15.514]  And I absolutely knew this was coming.
[02:35:17.130 --> 02:35:21.715]  Before they started inventing these hundreds of genders, I knew that they are deconstructing a human being.
[02:35:24.778 --> 02:35:32.646]  And so, if the individual can represent a parliament of organs, then it is not an individual, it's a DIVIGUAL.
[02:35:32.946 --> 02:35:34.728]  DIVIGUAL, not INDIVIDUAL.
[02:35:34.748 --> 02:35:39.493]  In other words, the individual becomes a post-individual agglomerate.
[02:35:40.888 --> 02:35:44.911]  So again, we've gone from humanity to transhumanity, next stage is post-humanity.
[02:35:45.432 --> 02:35:47.473]  We become a post-individual.
[02:35:49.054 --> 02:35:52.357]  And this has to do with the dispersion of personality.
[02:35:53.778 --> 02:35:59.362]  And so then we have the proliferation of NYX on the internet, with the liberation of one's own self.
[02:36:01.244 --> 02:36:04.586]  And so instead of me, we have this black hole.
[02:36:05.697 --> 02:36:12.321]  That makes itself known via this nebulosity, pulverization of these many different fragments.
[02:36:13.482 --> 02:36:24.669]  In other words, the human being made up of individual parts that together are a parliament of independent elements of a body that do not form a union with each other.
[02:36:24.689 --> 02:36:25.750]  How crazy is that?
[02:36:28.432 --> 02:36:51.523]   And so in this way, in the postmodern world, from the perspective of sociology and from the perspective of philosophy, It literally represents a certain paradigm that is much broader than postmodernism, because postmodernism is a cultural phenomenon that represents, let's say, certain looming trends of postmodernism.
[02:36:52.703 --> 02:37:01.045]  But postmodernism is the logical result that summarizes the entire content of this historical process, at least in Europe.
[02:37:02.904 --> 02:37:15.450]  And all this, again, took place gradually because the modern itself, before the 16th century, had its own complex theological and also philosophical prerequisites at the time of the European Middle Ages.
[02:37:16.551 --> 02:37:27.877]  And of course, without forgetting that in ancient Greece, well, there are certain trends that, well, as the emergence of democracy, for example, for which both Plato and Aristotle consider to be a degeneration.
[02:37:29.179 --> 02:37:43.210]  For us now, democracy is exceptional and it's good, but in pre-modern times, democracy was exceptionally bad, and the worst, absolutely the worst form of governance according to Aristotle and Plato.
[02:37:44.331 --> 02:38:02.691]   Because you have a degenerate form of common experience, democracy, that is built not from the top down, where the wisest and the most intelligent people are the top, but from the bottom up, from the stupidest, Most scoundrels, you know, upwards.
[02:38:03.991 --> 02:38:06.413]  And they're chosen by the same kinds of people to govern them.
[02:38:08.634 --> 02:38:11.676]  And so, what will come after this post-modern world?
[02:38:11.776 --> 02:38:12.717]  The answer is nothing!
[02:38:13.977 --> 02:38:16.219]  Because post-modernism is already nothing.
[02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:24.364]  Post-modernist text is irrational idiocy and the value of this post-modern world, well, that's schizophrenic.
[02:38:25.677 --> 02:38:31.181]  Because before, again, reason tried to unite the disjointed elements of human knowledge.
[02:38:31.221 --> 02:38:40.288]  Today, post-modernists offer us the possibility of freeing ourselves from the bonds of knowledge, taking us into the world of absolute freedom.
[02:38:40.348 --> 02:38:41.248]  Freedom from what?
[02:38:42.589 --> 02:38:46.392]  It has nothing to do with freedom to speak, it has to do with freedom from responsibility.
[02:38:49.334 --> 02:38:52.737]  Freedom from history, from obligations, freedom from knowledge.
[02:38:54.901 --> 02:38:57.903]  Or you're absolutely free to kill yourself if you want, because there are too many of us.
[02:38:57.923 --> 02:38:58.703]  Help us out!
[02:38:59.964 --> 02:39:02.085]  Let's save the world by killing ourselves.
[02:39:02.125 --> 02:39:03.325]  That's what the Club of Rome is saying.
[02:39:03.926 --> 02:39:04.786]  We are the enemy.
[02:39:05.827 --> 02:39:06.967]  That's what they're doing in Canada.
[02:39:08.708 --> 02:39:09.909]  They're taking money to kill yourself.
[02:39:12.290 --> 02:39:13.390]  They're doing the same in Japan.
[02:39:15.271 --> 02:39:20.514]  And so what about, we're going to end in a couple of minutes, so what about this post-modernist politics?
[02:39:21.937 --> 02:39:28.821]  Well, it means that democracy stops being the power of the majority and becomes the power of minorities, which is what we're seeing right now.
[02:39:28.861 --> 02:39:29.121]  Why?
[02:39:29.381 --> 02:39:39.106]  Because the majority of people is still related to the modern world that could elect a dictator or an authoritarian character.
[02:39:39.166 --> 02:39:57.060]   But if a minority rules, also different minorities, ethnic, religious, sexual, sex, perverts, pedophiles, Black Lives Matter, Then these minorities are going to create a society where there will be nothing concrete or sacred.
[02:39:58.681 --> 02:40:01.742]  Everything will be fun, everything will be virtual, just like gay parades.
[02:40:02.403 --> 02:40:04.644]  Everybody is happy, momentarily happy.
[02:40:05.665 --> 02:40:08.546]  Everything is instantaneous, immediate pleasure now.
[02:40:10.147 --> 02:40:14.430]  Immediate and non-fundamental satisfaction and not anchored in values.
[02:40:16.789 --> 02:40:21.193]  And so what this does is it brings us closer to the pre-established objective.
[02:40:21.253 --> 02:40:23.415]  Celebration of total nihilism.
[02:40:24.396 --> 02:40:26.438]  And that's where we're heading right now unless we stop.
[02:40:27.599 --> 02:40:29.440]  And that's why they need to destroy Alex Jones.
[02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:31.402]  That's why they need to destroy Trump.
[02:40:32.583 --> 02:40:35.526]  That's why they need to destroy anything that stands in the way of reason.
[02:40:36.347 --> 02:40:37.788]  Of making us think.
[02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:41.872]  Divine spark of reason.
[02:40:42.512 --> 02:40:43.033]  Logic.
[02:40:44.727 --> 02:40:50.811]  Instead of that, they want to give you the claptrap of 60, 70, 80, 90 different, you know, men and females don't exist anymore.
[02:40:51.871 --> 02:40:52.732]  You have choices!
[02:40:53.412 --> 02:40:56.314]  We're going to separate one whole into these little bite-sized pieces.
[02:40:56.534 --> 02:40:57.415]  They've always done that.
[02:40:58.315 --> 02:40:59.976]  Divide, divide, divide, divide, divide, divide.
[02:41:02.158 --> 02:41:04.019]  And that's why Alex Jones must stay in the air.
[02:41:07.141 --> 02:41:10.863]  Because that's the only way we can actually get people to realize and wake up.
[02:41:12.366 --> 02:41:14.668]  To what these people have been doing for a very long time.
[02:41:17.110 --> 02:41:19.772]  Except they have the need to destroy this now because they're running out of time.
[02:41:21.753 --> 02:41:22.554]  Stay vigilant.
[02:41:23.635 --> 02:41:24.475]  Become aware.
[02:41:25.997 --> 02:41:28.939]  We cannot compromise because freedom is a choice.
[02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:34.683]  And the only way we can maintain it is total and perpetual vigilance.
[02:41:35.724 --> 02:41:36.445]  God bless you all.
[02:41:36.465 --> 02:41:37.426]  Thanks for being with us.
[02:41:37.586 --> 02:41:40.348]  I'm Daniel Estulin, taking over from Alex Jones.
[02:41:40.448 --> 02:41:43.627]   It's been a pleasure and honor To host InfoWars.
[02:41:44.328 --> 02:41:45.129]  Have a wonderful day.
[02:41:45.590 --> 02:42:06.829]  Until next week, God bless.
[02:42:04.721 --> 02:42:06.783]  I came out with Nitric Boost three years ago.
[02:42:06.803 --> 02:42:08.124]  It was a sleeper product.
[02:42:08.144 --> 02:42:08.864]  I didn't even promote it.
[02:42:09.064 --> 02:42:15.509]  But as listeners began to use it, it has become one of our top selling products because of the incredible results they get.
[02:42:15.650 --> 02:42:24.977]  If you want to give your cardiovascular system a leg up, if you want to go in and help clean out and purify your blood, ladies and gentlemen, Nitric Boost is the way to go.
[02:42:25.277 --> 02:42:28.179]  You've heard Dr. Judy Mikovits talk about how it's an amazing formula.
[02:42:28.500 --> 02:42:30.041]  This is what she's recommended to people.
[02:42:30.061 --> 02:42:36.745]   Ladies and gentlemen, it does So many great things like, but you notice what happens in the morning if you're a man.
[02:42:36.765 --> 02:42:38.626]  I feel like I'm 16 years old again.
[02:42:38.926 --> 02:42:45.830]  When I was 16, I'd already had probably, I hate to brag, so I'm not bragging, it's actually shameful, probably 150 women or more.
[02:42:46.130 --> 02:42:46.770]  That's conservative.
[02:42:47.110 --> 02:42:48.811]  Nitric Boost is simply amazing.
[02:42:48.871 --> 02:42:50.052]  It's great for women as well.

[02:43:19.073 --> 02:43:22.075]  Many years ago, I coined the term 360Win.
[02:43:22.535 --> 02:43:25.177]  That's another way of saying it's a non-zero-sum game.
[02:43:25.577 --> 02:43:30.321]  When you have a sum game, it's a pizza, there's only so many pieces, it doesn't get bigger.
[02:43:30.741 --> 02:43:36.605]  But if something is symbiotic, if something empowers everybody involved with it, it is a 360Win.
