[00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:26.149]  It is Saturday, November 9th, 2024.
[00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.530]  And in just...
[00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:44.509]  Four and a half days, Infowars, this building, this equipment, this operation, the website could be taken over and gone up for auction, ordered by the federal bankruptcy court for crimes we didn't commit.
[00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.810]  We are the A-Team.
[00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.850]  Three days, eight hours, 57 minutes, four seconds.
[00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.030]  All right.
[00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.450]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.090]  You can see the headline.
[00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:59.560]  Special live Saturday broadcast.
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:15.340]  Alex Jones reveals the secrets of how and why Trump won and why it's so important to taking our country back completely, because we've just won a bigger battle, but not the war yet, but we are winning, and then take the world back intellectually against the globalist tyranny.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.400]  All right.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:25.879]  I was thinking this morning about shooting a special message to President Trump directly, and I still intend to do that.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.680]  But this is a message to Trump.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.959]  It's a message to all of you.
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:40.060]  It's a message to Joe Rogan, a message to Tucker Carlson, a message to Elon Musk, a message to J.D. Vance, a message to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:51.879]  I have been doing this intensely and with the greatest success more than anybody else.
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.659]  And the question is, why is that?
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.680]  And this has nothing to do with credit.
[00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:58.239]  In fact, it's the opposite.
[00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.219]  It has to do with the fact that we are known as being tomorrow's news today.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.120]  And many historians have said that those that do not know history are doomed to repeat it.
[00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:21.060]  To know the present and the future is to know the past and to be able to study the different power structures, the different cultures, the different convergences that are happening there.
[00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.210]  So, everything I'm about to talk about here is just a snapshot.
[00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:35.530]  Now, it'll actually sound detailed and complex, but that itself is just a snapshot.
[00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:43.590]  And most of what I'm going to say this audience is going to know, and Trump is going to know, and Don Jr.
[00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:49.129]  is going to know, and Melania is going to know, and Tucker is going to know, and Elon is going to know.
[00:02:50.449 --> 00:03:10.169]  But when I see how we're responding to the globalists that are now off balance and in deep trouble, and I see the different camps in the global resistance to it and the exploding populist movement, I don't see a unified compendium of understanding.
[00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:16.789]  That doesn't mean a compendium of action and we all agree with each other because we're all smarter in different ways.
[00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:28.889]  But I do know the history, I do know what's currently happening, and I have the best idea, hands down, of what is coming, or the different variants of those futures.
[00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:44.289]  It's like in Dune, Paul Atreides, once he gets the big brain boost and access to all the ancestral memory, he explains to people, contrary to the prophecy, that he doesn't know the exact future, because that is...
[00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:52.800]  Affected by people's actions, but he can see with all the data, depending on the choices, the different futures.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:26.290]  Now, the archetype in Frank Herbert's incredible book that really is a sociology, psychological, anthropological masterpiece put in a science fiction realm 3,000 years of the future is Is that it in an archetypal stylized work is
[00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.470]  an allegory for the some ancestral cultural knowledge of humans.
[00:04:31.389 --> 00:05:01.860]  And how have you really had gotten a huge grasp of that but also had a lot of life experience in testing those historical Gestalts that you could understand the trend lines down to very specific details and destinations and then accessing the different cultural movements
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:14.579]  and technological developments that had developed throughout those human reservoirs that you could then, to a great extent, control the future.
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:25.000]  Now, the global social architects, social engineers, do have a great understanding of this, and they've made a decision to have what they call the end of history.
[00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:36.670]  Where they don't want competing cultures and ideas and human desires to be able to dictate other possible futures.
[00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.269]  They have a future that they have decided for humanity.
[00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:51.930]  And to do that, they have to really dumb people down, balkanize society, break down the basic human systems, poison the population, slowly kill us.
[00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:00.000]  Because if you can't control something, The only way to control it is to kill it.
[00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:07.000]  And we've studied that and we've elaborated on the death cult and we've popularized the understanding of it from their own admissions, their own programs.
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.279]  And there's a great awakening to that operation.
[00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:17.980]  And a great resistance forming and expanding and permeating and ascending.
[00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:25.660]  But you can't just oppose a worldview and a vision.
[00:06:27.329 --> 00:06:47.029]  I mean, you can, but then you might blunt it or even stop it, but because of its very inertia and its very gravitational, cultural gravitas, it will create edipules in its wake that,
[00:06:47.730 --> 00:07:00.600]  whereas as we stab the beast, like in Greek mythology, and blood pours from it, As it dies, those very pools of blood form new monsters that rise up.
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:21.839]  Like when Perseus cuts off the head of Medusa, her head bounces on the ground, but out of the blood from her carotid arteries, new beasts rise.
[00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:25.480]  Now that itself...
[00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:33.850]  It is a fable, an archetype, but in it is great truth because we see that in society and culture and history.
[00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:59.100]  So I am now going to do my best here to focus in on a very important slice of what's currently happening and what it's connected to historically and then where that Moving system is going currently.
[00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:10.439]  And one could write a billion pages on the subject because it's always changing and always growing and that's what life is all about.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.379]  As soon as you think you know life, it's already moved on and changed.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.540]  The only constant is change.
[00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.949]  So, here in the last few days is what made me really cogitate on this.
[00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:27.870]  And then, this morning I went out and did some errands for the family.
[00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:32.549]  And then I went to the gym before I came here.
[00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:34.029]  Public gym.
[00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.509]  And it wasn't very full of people.
[00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.169]  The gas station I went in wasn't very full.
[00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:41.570]  The grocery store had a lot of folks in it.
[00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:45.409]  And this itself is a big story that I just want to start with.
[00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:48.600]  I was completely mobbed everywhere.
[00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:51.139]  There were probably ten people in the gym.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.139]  Nine of them were listeners and came over and talked to me.
[00:08:56.019 --> 00:08:58.279]  I got talked to by the clerk behind the counter.
[00:08:58.779 --> 00:09:00.980]  There were seven or eight people in the gas station.
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.179]  I was getting a bottle of water and some peanuts.
[00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:07.139]  Just gassed up the car.
[00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:10.399]  Got mobbed in there.
[00:09:10.899 --> 00:09:12.159]  Got mobbed in the grocery store.
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.620]  And I always got asked the same question.
[00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:20.259]  Now that Trump's won, what comes next?
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.080]  This is incredible.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:22.799]  This is amazing.
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:23.539]  What do you think?
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.440]  Will they try to kill him?
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.179]  What's coming next?
[00:09:27.919 --> 00:09:29.659]  Is Trump going to go after the bad guys?
[00:09:29.779 --> 00:09:31.080]  I mean, those are important questions.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:44.519]  But the point is, of many, that that's what I've been seeing in the public in Austin, where I've lived since high school, born and raised in Texas, but moved here from Dallas when I was 16.
[00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:50.399]  And I was there when Trump was running for office.
[00:09:51.019 --> 00:10:07.039]  I was there in his first administration during the last four years of our populist anti-globalist movement being in purgatory, in exile, being attacked,
[00:10:07.259 --> 00:10:09.960]  and...
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.659]  Your piece fell off again.
[00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:13.379]  It just does that a lot.
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.259]  So...
[00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:31.529]  Out of that public gauge, and I go around the country as well, I knew Trump was going to win in a massive landslide because I've never been mobbed anywhere close to this.
[00:10:34.169 --> 00:10:37.970]  In the past, if I was at the gym and there were 10 people in it, two would come over.
[00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:40.509]  If there were 50 people in it, 10 would come over.
[00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.889]  If there was three people in it, maybe one would come over.
[00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:44.570]  Or sometimes none.
[00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:56.470]  Now, it's the majority of people, wherever I go, every race, color, and creed, they can be Asian, they can be Middle Eastern, they can be black, they can be white, they can be old, they can be young, they can be gay, they can be straight.
[00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.269]  It's all the same.
[00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:07.289]  So, when I used to, you know, get confronted a lot when Trump first got elected and things like that, I still was majority positive feedback.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.779]  But still, I would get yelled at and screamed at almost every time I went out in public by at least somebody.
[00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:14.860]  Happens every six months now.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:15.559]  Maybe.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.019]  So, as I've said many times, I'm a gauge of that.
[00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:26.419]  You're not public figures, which is a great thing, your anonymity.
[00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:33.240]  But one of the fringe benefits of being a public figure that kind of cancels out a lot of the bad is that I'm a gauge.
[00:11:34.169 --> 00:11:37.309]  Like a thermometer you stick in a turkey to see how cooked it is.
[00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:42.710]  Or a barometer you put outside to see what the pressure is.
[00:11:45.169 --> 00:11:46.250]  The atmospheric pressure.
[00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:51.250]  So, I don't even need to look at poles and things to tell you there was going to be a landslide.
[00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.649]  Which I did.
[00:11:55.129 --> 00:11:55.490]  And...
[00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:10.529]  I knew, though, that they were going to up the cheating, but the Republican Party, now pretty much run by the Trumps, they've almost gotten full control, had such a good game on the ground with lawyers and everybody prepared that they got caught so much.
[00:12:11.409 --> 00:12:18.169]  And then all the old corruption, the court cases, has been proven that they did steal Arizona and Georgia and Michigan and Pennsylvania.
[00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:25.269]  And so the story there is the action and the investment and time and money paid off.
[00:12:25.429 --> 00:12:27.950]  Wow, people stood up and evil got in trouble.
[00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:29.529]  What did Thomas Jefferson say?
[00:12:29.629 --> 00:12:33.190]  He was asked by a newspaper reporter, why does evil prevail?
[00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.629]  And he said, all that evil men in tyranny need to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:42.769]  So there's a lot of lessons to what just happened.
[00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:49.710]  And I hear Elon Musk nail a few of them dead on and Tucker a few and Trump a few.
[00:12:50.799 --> 00:12:54.340]  And I didn't even write notes for this because when I try to write notes, I think of even more angles.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:13:03.320]  But I'm going to try to break down here why Trump won, how and why.
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:11.279]  And this isn't some history lesson so we can sit here and celebrate and feel good about ourselves.
[00:13:12.539 --> 00:13:19.259]  It's so that we recognize what is effective, what is true, what resonates, what is powerful.
[00:13:21.649 --> 00:13:25.129]  Because we've won this biggest battle yet, but the war's not won yet.
[00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:28.669]  So we need to assess why we won.
[00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:37.850]  And we have to assess how Trump got shut down and bogged down in the swamp eight years ago and got some done.
[00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.129]  He likes to focus on that.
[00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:40.909]  And that's positive and that's great.
[00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.190]  But I like to focus on where and how we failed.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:52.659]  So that we don't repeat that again and then spotlight while we succeeded so we do it even better and stronger.
[00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:54.980]  Now, I think that's very simple, isn't it?
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:02.200]  So, there's a lot of angles to this, but let's just start here.
[00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:04.220]  We'll do an overhead shot in a minute.
[00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:06.320]  This is a window into what I'm talking about.
[00:14:11.159 --> 00:14:23.360]  And I use this example not because it's me, but because it's all over the news, trend at the top of Facebook, X, CNN, all over the news the last three days.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.820]  Videos, people talking about it, hundreds of millions of views that I just ran into without even looking.
[00:14:31.419 --> 00:14:32.700]  People all over the street.
[00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:33.399]  Oh, that was the other thing.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.000]  Everybody's, I mean, family, people on the street, everywhere.
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.200]  Is, are you going to be the new White House press secretary?
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.159]  And that all comes from Don Jr.
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.279]  Last year saying, hey, I'm serious.
[00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:55.000]  I really think when we win, we ought to make Alex Jones a press secretary at least for a few weeks or a month or so.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.000]  And then now that's been picked back up.
[00:15:03.399 --> 00:15:04.799]  And it's all over the news.
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.580]  And I'll show you some of those headlines.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:16.700]  But this is the way to accurately break down what's really happening.
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:36.409]  And through this window, or through this doorway, I will then back into all the other information, why Trump won, how Trump won, what was done right, what was done wrong, not just in this campaign, but eight years ago when he got in and the deep state came in and sabotaged And Trump and his team and his people,
[00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:45.889]  I know, think about this.
[00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:58.409]  They won't reflexively get stuck in the past and reflexively do the same thing they did before and make the same mistakes.
[00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:04.559]  And obviously, don't put bad people in the administration, but it's bigger than that.
[00:16:05.039 --> 00:16:14.259]  Don't let the controlled corporate media, when they make false allegations, always respond to them, because that's the only way they have power.
[00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:23.799]  I mean, there's literally hundreds of these points, and they're all monumental and incredibly important, and I can explain exactly why we shouldn't do it, and people will say, we already know that.
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:24.940]  Exactly.
[00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:26.059]  It's prima facie.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.440]  On its face.
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:28.659]  In Latin.
[00:16:30.169 --> 00:16:32.149]  Prima facie means on its face, caught right-handed.
[00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.809]  How do we know this guy killed his wife?
[00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:38.509]  He shot her in front of, you know, eight or nine neighbors that were mowing their yards in the front yard on Sunday morning.
[00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:40.450]  Or Sunday afternoon, or whatever.
[00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:49.350]  So, let's talk about Alex Jones for press secretary.
[00:16:51.549 --> 00:16:54.529]  Number one, let's be clear.
[00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.350]  I don't want to be the White House press secretary.
[00:16:57.799 --> 00:16:59.899]  I'm not up here lobbying to be White House press secretary.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.659]  And I'll explain why in a moment.
[00:17:02.139 --> 00:17:05.180]  If they asked me to do it, I would do it for a couple weeks.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.440]  Just like Don Jr.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:06.779]  said.
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.859]  And I'll explain why.
[00:17:11.759 --> 00:17:13.039]  But that's not the story.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.160]  It's the debate about this that is important and informative.
[00:17:16.519 --> 00:17:16.960]  Alright?
[00:17:18.059 --> 00:17:19.619]  Why is Trump popular?
[00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.380]  Because he's a maverick.
[00:17:21.519 --> 00:17:22.400]  Because he's a...
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:29.599]  We outlaw a folk hero against the system because they've tried to get him over and over again and they can't.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.259]  Because they've lied so much and persecuted him so much.
[00:17:32.299 --> 00:17:33.220]  We love an underdog.
[00:17:34.099 --> 00:17:35.859]  And he has incredible energy and stamina.
[00:17:36.059 --> 00:17:37.839]  And he actually does what he says he's going to do.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.500]  And he makes mistakes.
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.140]  But he's real and he means well.
[00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:41.400]  And he does care about America.
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.079]  He wants prosperity.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.299]  And then we also love him because his enemies are our enemies.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.440]  There are people oppressing us that also hate us.
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.119]  And we understand he's our champion.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:18:07.779]  Now, a lot of Republicans the last eight years, quietly, and this is a big phenomenon that's been documented in studies and polls, would never say they supported Trump, but they secretly did, like it was some guilty, closeted pleasure.
[00:18:12.359 --> 00:18:28.059]  And As the public realized how dangerous World War III was and the collapsing currency and the inflation and the open borders and could see the great reset that's by design trying to make us poor so we can be more easily controllable.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:37.099]  And so the terms of our surrender can be dictated to us under the global social credit score and BlackRock and the ESG central bank digital currencies.
[00:18:38.059 --> 00:18:39.500]  And a thousand other reasons.
[00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:43.910]  People finally got that it was an existential threat to us and that Trump was right.
[00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.369]  They're not trying to get him.
[00:18:45.809 --> 00:18:46.569]  He's in the way.
[00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.630]  They're trying to get through him to get to us.
[00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.990]  And these are all basic truths, but people really started to get it.
[00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:00.529]  And so, President Trump...
[00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:18.359]  It embodies not just that, but the public getting past the peer pressure and the bullying and the condescension and the dictating that we're bad and we're dirty and we're garbage and we're filth and we're Nazis and we're Hitler and we deserve to die and we need to be put in camps,
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:38.630]  we need to be killed and we need to have people get in our faces and go to our houses and kick our ribs in and puncture our lungs and shoot us in the head and shoot Congressman Scalise in the stomach and all of that intimidation Didn't work and backfired,
[00:19:38.769 --> 00:19:40.009]  but it took a while.
[00:19:41.009 --> 00:19:49.589]  And the backfiring, the rejection of that, the pendulum swinging back against that, is just starting.
[00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:56.440]  The explosion of people finally finding their soul and their guts and their will has just begun.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.839]  And don't you feel it?
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:58.700]  Don't you see it?
[00:19:59.019 --> 00:20:00.720]  Doesn't it resonate with you?
[00:20:00.819 --> 00:20:02.559]  Doesn't it satisfy you?
[00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:04.000]  Doesn't it empower you?
[00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:04.940]  Doesn't it enrich you?
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.299]  Doesn't it fulfill you?
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.000]  Doesn't it complete you?
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.059]  Because you're meant to stand up and do the right thing.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.359]  You're not meant to live on your knees.
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.779]  You're not meant to be a coward.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.599]  You're not meant to be condescended to and brainwashed to be a slave.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.700]  And live under mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:20:22.519 --> 00:20:39.180]  So this is a dying debt establishment that hasn't had credibility or power or big ratings in a long time being fully repudiated and losing the last bits of its con artist confidence game.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:47.799]  They threw everything they had at the American people and at President Trump and at others.
[00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.150]  And outspend him 3 to 1.
[00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:54.230]  And 95% of the donations were big corporations to Kamala.
[00:20:56.509 --> 00:20:58.029]  And it didn't work.
[00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:02.869]  And there was a wall of fraud and illegals voting and voting machines flipping votes and all of it.
[00:21:03.009 --> 00:21:08.450]  But it was so big, the landslide, that it was still a decent landslide.
[00:21:08.869 --> 00:21:15.670]  The seawall of election fraud and propaganda and censorship and Google manipulation...
[00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.170]  Was a thousand feet tall.
[00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.769]  And the red wave was two thousand feet tall.
[00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.609]  So it cleared and still half the wave going over.
[00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:26.230]  He won the popular.
[00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.349]  And he won the electoral college.
[00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:31.970]  And he got.
[00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:38.789]  Almost 17 million votes more than Kamala.
[00:21:40.769 --> 00:21:41.849]  And she got.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.099]  17-plus million votes, 16-plus million votes less than Biden.
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.619]  I know she's unpopular.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.299]  Does anybody believe that?
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:48.559]  No.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.420]  They weren't able to openly go in and cram all those in.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:22:05.539]  They front-loaded it with fraud, but everybody was watching close to election on Election Day and caught the buses and vans and California plates coming in with the big boxes, and they went ahead at 1 a.m.
[00:22:05.619 --> 00:22:08.119]  and all those key battlegrounds and said, no, it's too late.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.819]  The lawyers are in there.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.480]  The police are here.
[00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:11.160]  We can't do it.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.259]  You can't just board up the windows this time and kick people out.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.740]  Because they're watching.
[00:22:17.579 --> 00:22:18.980]  Because they're standing up.
[00:22:19.359 --> 00:22:21.400]  What do evil men and tyrants need to flourish?
[00:22:22.619 --> 00:22:24.079]  What did our third president say?
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.000]  Author of the Declaration of Independence.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.940]  Probably one of the greatest intellectuals in history.
[00:22:28.759 --> 00:22:30.460]  Certainly as good a writer as William Shakespeare.
[00:22:30.819 --> 00:22:31.700]  What was his name?
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.720]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.920]  He said all the evil men and tyrants need to flourish.
[00:22:36.059 --> 00:22:36.500]  Could have been to do nothing.
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.240]  He also said...
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.519]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.900]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:53.200]  So, there's a lot of reasons we had success.
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.839]  We admitted there was fraud.
[00:22:55.839 --> 00:22:57.500]  We admitted we were up against criminals.
[00:22:57.819 --> 00:23:00.279]  But we didn't say, I'm not going to vote because of that.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.299]  We went and studied it.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:11.839]  And learn that there was only 7 to 8 to 9 percent, 10 percent maximum, depending on the area, that they could bake in statistically with different systems before it's 100 percent can be caught.
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:29.089]  And because of all the lawsuits proving fraud that they tried to keep quiet in the press but made it in the news around the country, and the feds, the judges saying illegals can vote, In 10 states, and then the Supreme Court a week before the election saying,
[00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:30.190]  oh, but you can't in Virginia.
[00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:30.910]  People don't wait.
[00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.690]  Illegals are voting.
[00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:33.230]  See, we fought them.
[00:23:33.349 --> 00:23:40.809]  We stood up to a rigged system and drew them out by engaging the fraudulent system.
[00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.470]  We didn't say, oh, it's perfect, and go along with it.
[00:23:43.509 --> 00:23:47.950]  We said it's a fraud, like playing a football game when you got eight players and they got 11.
[00:23:48.769 --> 00:23:53.650]  But we still went out and showed everybody and exposed the fraud.
[00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:55.630]  If you didn't show up and forfeit it, they would win.
[00:23:57.059 --> 00:24:01.279]  We showed the refs were a scam four years ago.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.720]  This time they tried it, didn't work.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.920]  So it's a process.
[00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:08.660]  Now back to Trump.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:16.019]  And I will cut a straight and clean piece for him as he doesn't have all the time that I'll get to him in five minutes or something.
[00:24:16.099 --> 00:24:19.220]  But I need to get this done because this is important because history is happening now.
[00:24:19.339 --> 00:24:20.200]  We've got to get ahead of all this.
[00:24:20.319 --> 00:24:21.880]  We've been getting ahead of things.
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.279]  And that's why we're winning now.
[00:24:25.359 --> 00:24:27.839]  You can't just be sitting there and let the system come out with its narrative.
[00:24:28.039 --> 00:24:29.140]  It's a dying collapse system.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.440]  And that's really the big takeaway, is that this system's dead.
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.140]  Now, what are we going to build?
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:36.839]  I'll get to that in a moment.
[00:24:37.099 --> 00:24:39.859]  But back to why I bring up the Alex Jones press secretary thing.
[00:24:40.619 --> 00:24:41.640]  There's thousands of angles.
[00:24:41.799 --> 00:24:44.039]  That's why I could go anywhere with this, but it's all true.
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:45.480]  But I'm going to try to just boil it down simply.
[00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:51.859]  We finally realize we don't care if you say we're bad and evil and the devil and all this stuff.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:59.359]  If we support Trump, we know you're liars, you're a fraud, and we don't just put up with your bullying and attacks and back him.
[00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:00.140]  We like it.
[00:25:00.759 --> 00:25:01.880]  We're proud of it.
[00:25:02.079 --> 00:25:03.400]  You don't embarrass us.
[00:25:03.539 --> 00:25:04.599]  You don't control our will.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.420]  We've broken the conditioning.
[00:25:06.579 --> 00:25:07.559]  We've broken your spell.
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:14.720]  And then Joe Rogan and everybody else says, whoo, Trump won and fully endorses him.
[00:25:14.839 --> 00:25:20.690]  And now, Joe's going to go to the White House, the inauguration, and it's all going to be great.
[00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:30.049]  Now you see, that's what people are looking for.
[00:25:31.509 --> 00:25:32.990]  That's what people want.
[00:25:34.529 --> 00:25:40.450]  And so now, we don't need the Republicans and the Republican Party that we've almost got control of.
[00:25:40.509 --> 00:25:42.390]  There's still some neocons, but they're getting less and less.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.240]  They were still in half control like two years ago.
[00:25:46.319 --> 00:25:49.500]  Now we're like 85% control and we're taking it over.
[00:25:49.779 --> 00:25:53.099]  Took over the RNC. Didn't sit there and just lay down to fraud.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.819]  Getting stronger, not weaker.
[00:25:59.599 --> 00:26:03.880]  The Republican Party needs to stop caring what CNN and ABC News says.
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.799]  Stop responding to all their controversies because they have no more power.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.059]  And simply attack the globalists and we go on the offense setting the narratives.
[00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:18.559]  And our main message is, move bitch, get out of the way, we're going to fix all these problems.
[00:26:18.759 --> 00:26:28.039]  You just say, that's a bunch of lies, that's a bunch of crap, here's what's really going on, and you just move forward, and then you bring up your topics, your renaissance, your ideas, nine times out of ten.
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:41.319]  Sure, you still occasionally slap some lie down, but you understand that's a junior discredited facade of a discredited collapsed system.
[00:26:44.829 --> 00:26:47.309]  So you spend all your time on offense.
[00:26:48.809 --> 00:26:51.569]  Even when you respond to their lies, you don't even get into the technicals.
[00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.569]  You just point out these are known certified liars.
[00:26:54.109 --> 00:26:55.029]  Here's what we're really doing.
[00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:56.650]  Get on board, everybody.
[00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:57.109]  Let's go.
[00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:58.670]  Get behind me, Satan.
[00:26:59.329 --> 00:27:00.269]  Move, bitch, get out of the way.
[00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:03.269]  So Don Jr.
[00:27:03.849 --> 00:27:06.509]  understands what Marjorie Taylor Greene understands.
[00:27:08.819 --> 00:27:17.019]  When she first got into Congress and they tried to bully her and be mean to her because she'd been a supporter of mine and said nice things about me over the years, she said, I'm proud to defend Alex Jones.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.039]  What's been said about him is a lie.
[00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:20.660]  He's a great trailblazer.
[00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:23.980]  It wasn't just about defending me and we're friends and she's a great lady.
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:33.160]  It was about her understanding we've got to stick together and we've got to not let them dictate and tell us who's bad and who's good when we've already done our own research and we already know who somebody is.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.140]  They're not...
[00:27:35.869 --> 00:27:36.970]  The ratings agency.
[00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:38.589]  They're not the fact checkers.
[00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:39.750]  They're not the judge.
[00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:40.970]  They're not the jury.
[00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:42.329]  They're not the executioner.
[00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:43.329]  They're not our daddy.
[00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:44.710]  They're not our mommy.
[00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:46.049]  They're not our pastor.
[00:27:46.349 --> 00:27:47.410]  They're not our boss.
[00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:50.130]  They're not our husband, our wife, our son, our daughter.
[00:27:50.450 --> 00:28:02.470]  These are discredited people reading off teleprompters owned by the globalists, the big central banks that literally want to take everything away from us and make us poor slaves so they can then dictate to us depopulation agendas.
[00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:03.569]  They're the bad guys.
[00:28:04.069 --> 00:28:05.349]  And everybody's like, yeah, we already know all this.
[00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.130]  Yeah, but do we articulate it in one piece?
[00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:11.410]  So then, Don Jr.
[00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:15.450]  says this last year, a bunch of other people say it this year, and it explodes.
[00:28:15.569 --> 00:28:21.309]  People go, wait, that would really be entertaining and interesting, and I could go in there and just destroy the corporate media.
[00:28:22.849 --> 00:28:35.079]  And it's the ultimate F-U to them to say, yeah, The old Republican Party would never do this because they wanted to be part of the system and act like the facade still had power.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:41.720]  But obviously, if you put Alex Jones in as the press secretary, I would do a great job.
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.559]  I would dominate them.
[00:28:43.759 --> 00:28:45.200]  I would discredit them further.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:51.140]  I'd bring in real media, have them ask real questions or make their own statements, and it would make it legitimate again.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:29:00.650]  And it would give the people what they want, more of the rebel spirit More of the maverick.
[00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:03.470]  More of what Trump does.
[00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:04.569]  More of what we love.
[00:29:04.809 --> 00:29:10.210]  More Trump, less Republican establishment.
[00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.690]  So, I mean, it really is a no-brainer.
[00:29:13.829 --> 00:29:39.450]  And so, not to actually get me to be the press secretary, but as a litmus test in the new forming Trump administration, do you understand that making Alex Jones The press secretary is obviously the smartest avant-garde thing to do and other things like it.
[00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:43.170]  Because that's what got you here.
[00:29:43.349 --> 00:29:44.650]  That's what people want.
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:55.859]  Who cares if the discredited corporate media has demonized me for decades and intensely for eight years to make me a straw man bad guy to then attack Trump?
[00:29:56.079 --> 00:29:57.799]  Oh, Trump's associated with Alex Jones.
[00:29:58.019 --> 00:29:59.440]  Look how bad Alex Jones is.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.200]  Well, just like Trump's evil, look how bad his supporters are.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:11.380]  Whatever they're afraid of, whatever they demonize, whatever they attack is where they're weak.
[00:30:12.089 --> 00:30:15.349]  Oh, Trump will really be discredited if he prosecutes him in the deep state.
[00:30:16.009 --> 00:30:16.369]  No.
[00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:25.670]  His only hope to secure the republic and get his agenda through is to prosecute him because they're criminals and they're caught red-handed and they thought they were invincible.
[00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:30.569]  So they were sloppy and it's open and shut and it's justice and it's what you've got to do.
[00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:31.750]  It's the right thing to do.
[00:30:31.849 --> 00:30:32.609]  It's your duty.
[00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:33.609]  It's not a question.
[00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:36.690]  Now, I'll tell you some stories that have never been heard before.
[00:30:37.809 --> 00:30:39.529]  You can ask Joe Rogan, he'll tell you this is all true.
[00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:50.170]  About eight years ago, Joe, who I've known now since 1998, been friends since about 99, good friends, started having leftists on all the time.
[00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:59.730]  I started really joining with them and started going along with their ideas and supporting Bernie Sanders and then criticizing me.
[00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.829]  And I wasn't watching the show much because I was busy.
[00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:02.829]  I really liked the show.
[00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:05.150]  It was going to be the biggest at that point.
[00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:06.470]  Mine was the biggest.
[00:31:06.829 --> 00:31:08.509]  We weren't in competition, at least in my mind.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.359]  And he was saying, you know, all this stuff.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.160]  Oh, there's no engineering.
[00:31:17.019 --> 00:31:18.099]  Oh, this New World Order stuff.
[00:31:18.279 --> 00:31:19.259]  Oh, Alex Jones is out there.
[00:31:20.779 --> 00:31:26.579]  And I'd call him up, and I'd say, hey, buddy, you never invite me to the UFC anymore.
[00:31:26.579 --> 00:31:27.480]  We never get dinner anymore.
[00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:29.019]  You know, when he'd come to town, we'd hang out.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:45.960]  Listen, you can, I consider you to be a friend, but I said, if you keep attacking me, At the same time, joining the bad guys in front of me, when I know you know better, because you think they're winning or something, I said, you're really a bad person.
[00:31:46.059 --> 00:31:47.200]  That hurts my feelings.
[00:31:51.119 --> 00:31:53.859]  So I said, if you keep it up, I'm going to come after you.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:13.910]  And I also told him, I said, listen, the New World Order plan is Agenda 2030, the plan to release viruses, the plan to break down society, the plan to turn everything into a prison planet is real, and you don't want your daughters living in a world like that.
[00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:23.390]  This is really an evil plan, and I know they're going to do all this, and I'm telling the truth, and I'm telling you, you're betting on the wrong team if that's where you're going.
[00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:33.970]  Now, he decided at that point, because the political pressure was on him by the system, To not join them.
[00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:35.809]  And I'm not saying I did that.
[00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.630]  But he later called and said, look, I'm sorry that was going on.
[00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:39.089]  You're right.
[00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:40.470]  You're right.
[00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:41.789]  This, you know, this system.
[00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:44.369]  And then about four years ago, he said, I'm moving to Austin.
[00:32:44.609 --> 00:32:45.990]  And man, you really didn't predict it all.
[00:32:46.069 --> 00:32:46.789]  He said that publicly.
[00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:50.029]  And, you know, we become even better friends.
[00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.569]  It's not about me being the policeman and me being the boss or anything like that.
[00:32:52.829 --> 00:32:55.130]  I just know this New World Order is a real thing.
[00:32:55.150 --> 00:33:05.710]  And I knew once we had Agenda 2020, Which we've been under since 1992 in the UN treaty that Herbert Walker Bush signed us onto, that they were going to go operational in 2020.
[00:33:06.069 --> 00:33:16.349]  And by 2030, we would be an absolute prison planet in their own words, because I was watching their plan as they said they would do it decades before, tracking pretty much on time a little bit behind.
[00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:32.990]  So, it's like a big asteroid's 50 million miles away, and astronomers know about it, and it's coming, and NASA says it's gonna hit the Earth, we're gonna put missiles up there to stop it, now it's 20 million miles away, 10 million miles away, and, you know, they say, well, in six months it'll be here, and now it's a million miles away, it's gonna be here in a couple weeks.
[00:33:33.769 --> 00:33:34.849]  Are we gonna blow it up?
[00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:39.089]  I mean, I'm watching the asteroid come for 30 years, and now it's, like, right here.
[00:33:40.559 --> 00:33:47.380]  And we finally launch the rockets that have got the nukes on it to go blow up the asteroid when it's 300,000 miles away.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.920]  And we can knock it off course and it won't hit the Earth.
[00:33:50.539 --> 00:33:53.799]  Those are real NASA plans for real scenarios like that.
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:59.160]  That was a hypothetical example I gave, but we've launched...
[00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:04.809]  The spacecraft that have the missiles on them now.
[00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:05.950]  That's getting Trump elected.
[00:34:06.369 --> 00:34:10.210]  Now we've got to blow the giant 10-mile-across asteroid off course.
[00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:12.650]  Alright?
[00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:17.130]  So, yeah, we've got the craft going with the weapons.
[00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:19.369]  Now we've got to destroy the asteroid.
[00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:20.750]  That's a perfect analogy.
[00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:23.170]  So...
[00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:33.179]  Then as Joe saw all of the stuff I told him on and off air come true, he's fully on board.
[00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:40.099]  And I told you four years ago, I said, Joe's going to start getting more and more hardcore, and he's going to really go up against the globalist.
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:49.599]  But he did it in his own way to be nonpartisan and just reasonable, just asking questions, more effective, you see.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.260]  He's smart.
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.920]  And then right at the key point, boom, he's fully on board.
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.500]  And I told you three years ago, Musk's going to do the same thing.
[00:34:57.619 --> 00:35:01.679]  Because somebody close to Musk, several people very close to Musk, leave it at that.
[00:35:02.119 --> 00:35:03.099]  I mean, you're talking very close.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.199]  Told me that.
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.019]  So, you can pull the clips of me saying that.
[00:35:07.579 --> 00:35:09.280]  So, this is important stuff.
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:15.619]  Not just on-air strategy, but off-air strategy.
[00:35:18.119 --> 00:35:20.599]  And so, that's where we are.
[00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:45.030]  And so the people around Trump that care what CNN or the New York Times thinks are not the people that Trump needs to be listening to.
[00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:49.710]  And again, every viewer right now probably is going, okay, you just told us water's wet.
[00:35:52.639 --> 00:35:53.659]  You told us dogs bark?
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.760]  I mean, what is this?
[00:35:56.039 --> 00:35:56.920]  I know that.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:06.440]  But Trump didn't even understand that until recently.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:14.639]  He's like, wow, the old media, the mainstream media, which isn't even mainstream, it's corporate, it's propaganda, it's got an open agenda.
[00:36:15.739 --> 00:36:16.599]  That's against us.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.280]  He's like, they don't have very big audiences anymore.
[00:36:19.619 --> 00:36:21.300]  Wow, this podcasting thing.
[00:36:22.099 --> 00:36:25.679]  And so Trump won for a lot of reasons, but he broke with the system.
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:26.840]  He stopped caring about them.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.000]  He stopped responding as much, got on his own agenda.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.920]  That's our agenda.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.739]  Populist pro freedom prosperity agenda.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.380]  And then he did himself hundreds of podcasts.
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:46.480]  And the biggest ones have 30, 40 times the viewers of CNN or ABC. The smaller ones, as big as their audiences.
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.139]  And when Trump would go on, they'd be even bigger.
[00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:52.619]  Anyone with Elon Musk on Spaces should have done it 10 times.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:53.300]  Did it once.
[00:36:53.559 --> 00:36:54.800]  Over a billion people clicked it.
[00:36:55.219 --> 00:36:56.360]  And listened to it.
[00:36:56.739 --> 00:36:58.159]  Should have had a video component.
[00:37:00.519 --> 00:37:04.139]  But this time, Trump spent...
[00:37:07.429 --> 00:37:12.309]  5% of his time, that's a guesstimation, maybe less, on establishment media.
[00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:20.230]  And 95% on his own statements and his own press conferences and his own videos and podcasts and patriot media.
[00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:23.730]  That's not the alternative media from the mainstream.
[00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:27.090]  The mainstream was the mainstream 25 years ago.
[00:37:28.489 --> 00:37:29.989]  And I was the alternative.
[00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:46.460]  I have been, and Joe Rogan has been, And Tucker Carlson says he left Fox, the people's media with the biggest audiences, with the most accuracy, with the most effectiveness.
[00:37:46.659 --> 00:38:00.519]  And again, I know everybody knows this, but still we act like CNN or the New York Times is dominant.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:06.840]  But it's not just the old dinosaur media that's had its bluff called, that was dead a long time.
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:12.000]  It's like, you know, New Yorker magazine said, if we can't stop Trump, this means the mainstream media is dead.
[00:38:12.199 --> 00:38:18.219]  No, it's like somebody waking up 20 years after they're in a coffin and going, gee, I'm a skeleton, I'm dead.
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:20.400]  No, you're just admitting it now.
[00:38:21.199 --> 00:38:25.019]  It was election fraud that got Trump out four years ago.
[00:38:25.199 --> 00:38:26.519]  The numbers all show it.
[00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:30.079]  So...
[00:38:33.509 --> 00:38:53.010]  The realization of that and the understanding that the corporate establishment, deceptive, decepticon, dinosaur, enemy of the people media, their only tactic is to lie about us and then to get us to respond to them to get us off our own subjects.
[00:38:53.369 --> 00:38:55.349]  I mean, I get hit in the corporate media.
[00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:57.010]  I don't even look for it.
[00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:58.030]  I know it's more than this.
[00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:06.159]  National publications and national TV programs 15 times a day.
[00:39:07.639 --> 00:39:10.639]  That's a low day.
[00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:14.039]  And most of the time, I don't even look at it.
[00:39:14.159 --> 00:39:17.280]  I'll see it on accident and it can be some outlandish thing.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.900]  I just don't even look at it.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.400]  I don't even respond to it.
[00:39:20.739 --> 00:39:28.280]  Because if I sat there and I responded to that, my whole show would be about...
[00:39:29.469 --> 00:39:44.530]  They're a tax on me and defending myself instead of Oh, hey, Congress is trying to pass a law to engineer bio lettuce and tomatoes and potatoes that make you take mRNA vaccines that are mutinogenic and aren't vaccines,
[00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:47.389]  and they're going to put it in your food without telling you under law.
[00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:49.289]  That was in the news last week.
[00:39:49.469 --> 00:39:50.489]  By the way, I never played that.
[00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:51.269]  I should have covered that.
[00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.889]  I mentioned it.
[00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:57.849]  Pull up the Thomas Massey congressional hearing on vaccines and foods.
[00:39:57.949 --> 00:39:58.710]  And it's not vaccines.
[00:39:59.309 --> 00:40:02.969]  It's gene therapies, live nanotech that grows in your body.
[00:40:03.449 --> 00:40:04.530]  And this is science fiction.
[00:40:05.289 --> 00:40:12.050]  See, we need to be talking about stuff like that and go, okay, Alex Jones, I'm the devil.
[00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:12.750]  I'm the worst guy.
[00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:18.530]  Here's a clip of the private Federal Reserve heads saying they're above the law and government can't control them and they rule America.
[00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:21.010]  Let's just say, I'm the worst guy in the world.
[00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:21.989]  Here he is saying it.
[00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.449]  What do you think of that?
[00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:24.389]  Oh, but you're bad.
[00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:25.329]  You're Hitler.
[00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:26.210]  Okay, I'm Hitler.
[00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:26.769]  Let's move on.
[00:40:26.969 --> 00:40:29.110]  What about the Federal Reserve saying it's got a dictatorship over America?
[00:40:29.849 --> 00:40:30.909]  I think we should repeal it.
[00:40:30.989 --> 00:40:31.750]  We should abolish it.
[00:40:31.809 --> 00:40:32.369]  We should remove it.
[00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:38.329]  See, I'm not going to sit here and let them continue that.
[00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:42.969]  I'll mention some of their lies sometimes because it's informative about a larger issue.
[00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:47.110]  And to show people their tactics.
[00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:56.449]  But I'm not just going to sit here and constantly respond to stuff because that's their tactic to get me off message.
[00:40:57.869 --> 00:40:59.250]  And so what am I doing here?
[00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:01.150]  For people to just tune in.
[00:41:02.619 --> 00:41:07.079]  I'm saying we have had a historic massive victory because we told the truth.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:07.920]  We took action.
[00:41:08.039 --> 00:41:08.679]  We stood up.
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.679]  We didn't care about being bullied or attacked.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:17.139]  And the system now knows their mind control is broken.
[00:41:17.239 --> 00:41:29.420]  And the more they try to bully us, the more it backfires because they went to completely looney tunes, cartoon, absurdist, bizarro, grotesque lengths.
[00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:33.889]  And it's a big deal.
[00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:46.190]  And obviously, Trump doesn't want to get anywhere near Pompeo.
[00:41:46.389 --> 00:41:47.989]  Bill Gates wants the administration now.
[00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:48.869]  We'll get to that.
[00:41:50.130 --> 00:42:19.210]  And it shows you that not just corporate media, not just the dinosaur newspapers and CNN and broadcast TV and all that, But that Bill Gates and his money and Klaus Schwab and his money and all these other globalists who threw billions and billions against the American people and Trump It didn't work.
[00:42:19.389 --> 00:42:27.190]  But more importantly, Google with 93% search control, 93% of the world's searches are on Google.
[00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:29.469]  Won't even show you Republican candidates.
[00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:32.710]  Won't even show you anything but positive crap about Democrats.
[00:42:32.929 --> 00:42:37.230]  Won't even let you see on there that it's election day unless you're a Democrat.
[00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.630]  Then it gives you alerts on the screen without asking you.
[00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.469]  Knows you're a registered voter.
[00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:42.309]  Tells you go vote.
[00:42:44.269 --> 00:42:50.909]  That right there can gain an election 10, 15, 20 points according to congressional testimony by Professor Epstein and others.
[00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:57.590]  That shows they don't have all this power.
[00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:10.010]  Because people just might use Google to search where to get their brakes fixed or where some building they're going to visit somebody at is at.
[00:43:10.389 --> 00:43:13.449]  Or maybe they want to look up what type of flower that is in the backyard.
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:23.539]  But people know those searches when it comes to medical information or political information is crap.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.420]  And it reaches down into all the other searches as well.
[00:43:26.719 --> 00:43:29.039]  So they have extincted themselves.
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.880]  They are killing themselves.
[00:43:35.599 --> 00:43:40.760]  And so somebody that's savvy like an MTG. Oh yeah, savvy, the media makes fun of her.
[00:43:41.429 --> 00:43:42.170]  Well, so what?
[00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:43.210]  She's super smart.
[00:43:43.409 --> 00:43:50.869]  She has the highest election rate of any woman in Congress.
[00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:55.110]  It was one guy in Congress that got a higher re-election rate.
[00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.710]  Repeatedly.
[00:43:58.869 --> 00:44:02.070]  So, oh yeah, she's really unpopular because CNN says she's not.
[00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:03.190]  No, she's the most popular.
[00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:12.500]  And she understands back when it wasn't cool, you know, four years ago or longer, To say Alex Jones didn't do what they say.
[00:44:12.639 --> 00:44:13.280]  He's a great guy.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.059]  I stand with him.
[00:44:16.119 --> 00:44:17.719]  Because she understands we've got to stick together.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.280]  And she understands that we should celebrate the Mavericks.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:28.139]  Now, we laid the path and laid the foundation for Trump, for Elon Musk, for everybody.
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.360]  This broadcast.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:31.659]  This crew.
[00:44:32.139 --> 00:44:33.400]  And it's not about the credit.
[00:44:33.559 --> 00:44:34.840]  It's about understanding the history of it.
[00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:37.389]  And that's another example of history.
[00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:45.289]  When other big challenges come, even though there aren't a lot of people talking about it at the time, you've got to talk about it, knowing you're right, knowing it's the right thing to do.
[00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:48.929]  And it might take 50 years to change it, but it will change.
[00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:50.530]  It takes slavery.
[00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:58.489]  The abolition movement was not even big at all.
[00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:03.690]  It was just a few people in England and the U.S. in 1800.
[00:45:07.329 --> 00:45:10.889]  And 70 years later, it was banned almost everywhere in the world.
[00:45:13.889 --> 00:45:15.570]  And there's many other examples of that.
[00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.650]  You can't stop an idea whose time has come.
[00:45:18.389 --> 00:45:26.969]  Now they brought it back under other names, and the globalists running it, and we're going to expose and stop that, and the human trafficking, and the sex slavery, and all the rest of it.
[00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:31.750]  We'll certainly mitigate it down to 1% of what it is now, just like Trump did with the border previously.
[00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:36.349]  So she understands, Don Jr.
[00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:41.449]  understands that it's not just a troll to say let's put Alex Jones in there.
[00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:44.769]  It says we don't care your heads are going to explode.
[00:45:44.929 --> 00:45:46.869]  We don't care you're going to attack him.
[00:45:46.969 --> 00:45:50.530]  We don't care even if he says some wild stuff we may not even agree with.
[00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:52.010]  It's all about free speech.
[00:45:52.769 --> 00:45:59.250]  And it gets past how we self-censor and live in fear of what they're going to say about us.
[00:45:59.369 --> 00:46:01.090]  And we promote that.
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.900]  The avant-garde people.
[00:46:05.599 --> 00:46:06.920]  We celebrate it.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:15.139]  So, in the world, in politics and in life, I know I'm part of history.
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:16.159]  You're part of history.
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.780]  I know I'm part of a process.
[00:46:18.219 --> 00:46:20.920]  But I don't just step into the current process.
[00:46:21.019 --> 00:46:22.340]  I understand I can change the process.
[00:46:23.219 --> 00:46:28.099]  And so, I've already really been Trump's press secretary.
[00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:30.639]  And so have you.
[00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:47.030]  Whether it was little things you did or big things you did, when you defended the lies against him that were really lies about you, when you called in to talk radio, when you spoke out at church or work, when you called Congress, when you called into C-SPAN, when you shot a video on your Facebook or your ex,
[00:46:47.389 --> 00:46:56.550]  when you donated to Trump or helped keep us on air, all those things, you were America's and common sense and really God's press secretary.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.760]  So I don't need that position.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:01.960]  I've already got that position.
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:04.320]  It would get the highest ratings ever.
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:05.280]  It would be great.
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:06.239]  It would be wonderful.
[00:47:06.239 --> 00:47:10.599]  But that's because people want to see things like that.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.199]  They want to see a real debate.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.539]  They want to see a real knockdown drag out.
[00:47:14.719 --> 00:47:18.280]  They don't just want teleprompters removed.
[00:47:19.599 --> 00:47:25.179]  They don't want people in there pushing an establishment narrative and reading off a list of crap.
[00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:31.570]  You know, I ask every guest when we have time to do it, sometimes it's breaking.
[00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:34.690]  They go, I already like the person.
[00:47:34.789 --> 00:47:35.309]  I think they're interesting.
[00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:37.170]  I may want to talk about a specific topic.
[00:47:37.289 --> 00:47:38.389]  I'll say, hey, I want to talk about this.
[00:47:38.469 --> 00:47:39.230]  And they go, what else?
[00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:42.210]  And I go, just send us talking points.
[00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:47.289]  And it's not because I'm sending them talking points of what they can talk about.
[00:47:48.769 --> 00:47:49.869]  That's what the corporate media does.
[00:47:49.969 --> 00:47:50.190]  No, no, no.
[00:47:50.269 --> 00:47:53.849]  They send me their points so I can make sure we get to them.
[00:47:56.309 --> 00:48:00.250]  And a lot of times, I don't even look at the points until five minutes before they're on, and I'll look at it.
[00:48:00.329 --> 00:48:01.090]  Because they're already interesting.
[00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:02.369]  They already had something interesting to say.
[00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:06.389]  And I just want to hear, unfiltered, what they're going to do.
[00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:13.909]  Just like when I take phone calls for 28 years on talk radio.
[00:48:16.369 --> 00:48:17.050]  It's beautiful.
[00:48:17.269 --> 00:48:17.809]  It's random.
[00:48:18.889 --> 00:48:20.429]  It's like somebody dealing you cards.
[00:48:20.429 --> 00:48:21.409]  You don't know what you're about to get.
[00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:23.409]  It's the wild card.
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.559]  So that's where I come from.
[00:48:26.559 --> 00:48:27.539]  That's who I am.
[00:48:27.659 --> 00:48:39.420]  And that's so alien to people in the establishment, in media and government and agencies and universities, where they just get told what to say.
[00:48:39.619 --> 00:48:43.679]  They're protected because they do what they're told, because they've turned themselves into robots.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.039]  They've turned themselves into automatons, androids, repeaters.
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.039]  That's not a real person.
[00:48:49.199 --> 00:48:50.239]  That's not real life.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:55.599]  And that creates stagnancy, and it creates corruption, and it creates a place for corruption to hide.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:13.789]  And so I've spent a lot of time now on Trump being Trump, not letting the system dictate what we're doing or saying, not responding to almost all their crap, Unless you say,
[00:49:13.929 --> 00:49:17.909]  I don't normally respond to this, but since it's such a ridiculous lie, let's go ahead and show you the lie.
[00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:22.250]  And then if Trump's going to respond, do what the corporate media doesn't do.
[00:49:22.989 --> 00:49:24.670]  Come in and actually show the clip.
[00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:26.849]  I have an example of that coming up.
[00:49:27.469 --> 00:49:31.489]  Rachel Maddow said, you know, Trump just confessed to not needing votes because he stole the election.
[00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:34.829]  I mean, that's what they're saying.
[00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:40.230]  And she then plays a clip.
[00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:41.929]  That's short.
[00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:45.789]  And it sounds like Trump said, I don't need votes.
[00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:57.150]  No, he said, we got plenty of votes in 2016 and 2020, but they stole so many and blocked our votes and crammed the ballot boxes that if our votes just get counted for real, we'll win.
[00:49:58.179 --> 00:50:00.320]  Now, anybody understands what that's saying.
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:01.880]  I don't need more votes.
[00:50:02.019 --> 00:50:02.900]  I've already won twice.
[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:03.900]  We're already the winner.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:08.400]  I just need to stop them stuffing the ballot boxes and throwing away our ballots because that's how they do it.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.179]  They don't just stuff.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:10.400]  They destroy yours.
[00:50:10.539 --> 00:50:11.059]  Oh, sorry.
[00:50:11.119 --> 00:50:11.980]  The machine's all broken.
[00:50:12.179 --> 00:50:13.340]  We'll put them through you later.
[00:50:13.679 --> 00:50:14.400]  Throw them away.
[00:50:14.599 --> 00:50:15.420]  They've been caught everywhere.
[00:50:16.239 --> 00:50:22.860]  That's a totally common sense thing.
[00:50:23.039 --> 00:50:26.739]  But see, she shows it out of context where it's like, yeah, what do you mean by that?
[00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:28.590]  I'll show you the full clip.
[00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:30.610]  A five-year-old will understand what he's saying.
[00:50:30.789 --> 00:50:31.550]  I've already won.
[00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:32.429]  We've got the votes.
[00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:33.550]  The country's already awake.
[00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:35.389]  I just, you know, I'm not running against Kamala.
[00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:36.449]  I'm running against election fraud.
[00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:40.389]  Our issue is not getting more voters.
[00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:44.090]  Our issue is stopping them stealing it, which is damn true.
[00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:47.769]  That is the opposite of saying, I'm stealing it.
[00:50:47.909 --> 00:50:49.329]  I don't need more votes.
[00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:53.889]  And she plays a clip out of context that goes, he's crazy, that makes no sense.
[00:50:54.269 --> 00:50:55.429]  Unless he's stealing it.
[00:50:55.789 --> 00:51:03.590]  No, your viewers have Stockholm Syndrome and are delusional watching you lie to them every night on purpose.
[00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:10.530]  Like, take the shot, it's 100% effective, you cannot get COVID, you cannot share COVID. Biden said it too.
[00:51:11.789 --> 00:51:14.909]  And six months after they'd been caught and everybody knew it was a lie.
[00:51:16.139 --> 00:51:17.800]  I told you it was a lie before she said it.
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.679]  And I told you she'd say it, and then she did.
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.860]  But six months later, she was still saying it.
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.800]  It turned out she was getting $89,000.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:26.980]  Five nights a week.
[00:51:28.059 --> 00:51:37.219]  Every time she said, you take the shot, you cannot get COVID, and you cannot spread COVID. When really, it erases your immune system, it makes you get every other virus, including COVID, more often in the studies.
[00:51:38.239 --> 00:51:42.019]  And they knew that when they rolled it out on purpose to permanently mess up your immune system.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.440]  So you slowly die.
[00:51:46.469 --> 00:51:47.190]  What assholes?
[00:51:48.889 --> 00:51:50.829]  So, you know, I've got...
[00:51:50.829 --> 00:51:52.670]  I mean, here's what it is.
[00:51:52.769 --> 00:51:56.730]  I do all this research and then 90% of them play on air because do you really want to see Matt Al?
[00:51:58.929 --> 00:52:01.889]  Since I brought that one up, I'll show it to you.
[00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:07.230]  That's another reason a lot of times I don't even mention a lot of this stuff because I actually don't want to hear Hillary Clinton talk.
[00:52:07.489 --> 00:52:09.150]  I've already watched her say it.
[00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:10.929]  And you know about it.
[00:52:11.469 --> 00:52:22.460]  And that's what I'm saying is at a certain point, You've just got to think about, should I even respond to this?
[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:25.539]  Because again, they're setting the agenda by making you do it.
[00:52:27.719 --> 00:52:31.380]  So, I'm going to move on to the other big issues and why Trump won and how.
[00:52:31.579 --> 00:52:32.460]  How he won and why.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.699]  Because isn't this really important?
[00:52:37.039 --> 00:52:40.139]  And not just fall back into the old things that Trump did.
[00:52:40.539 --> 00:52:45.679]  The reason much of what he wanted to get done got sabotaged and then they tried to put him in prison.
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:50.269]  And Trump's got to know, if he doesn't, Get a good group in.
[00:52:50.469 --> 00:52:51.489]  Go on the offense.
[00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:56.090]  The system is going to totally crash the economy.
[00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:01.170]  If he doesn't get on the offense, they're going to totally try to put him in prison, try to kill him again.
[00:53:01.369 --> 00:53:02.289]  And Trump knows that.
[00:53:02.429 --> 00:53:03.269]  This is life and death.
[00:53:03.389 --> 00:53:07.550]  And he's told his crew, he's told his people, we're not putting up with crap.
[00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:08.590]  We're going on the war path.
[00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:14.349]  His top lawyer was on Benny Johnson about Leticia James, the Soros lady that ran on putting him in prison.
[00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:16.269]  He said, listen, fat ass.
[00:53:17.409 --> 00:53:24.889]  You come after Trump's constitutional rights as a citizen with a conspiracy to violate his constitutional rights, which is a felony, will put your fat ass in prison.
[00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:26.909]  And the left went, that's terrible!
[00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:28.090]  They're totalitarian!
[00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:28.889]  They're horrible!
[00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:32.150]  No, you're the ones with a criminal.
[00:53:33.469 --> 00:53:37.650]  You're the ones running around saying you're going to put people in jail because they're politics, having rigged trials.
[00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.829]  That's tyranny!
[00:53:38.969 --> 00:53:40.289]  You need to go to prison for that!
[00:53:40.869 --> 00:53:42.369]  You've actually committed crimes!
[00:53:42.809 --> 00:53:43.449]  And they're like...
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:46.219]  Little kid, oh look, tattle arm.
[00:53:47.119 --> 00:53:49.360]  Oh, he's doing something wrong.
[00:53:49.699 --> 00:53:53.480]  Oh, see, see, they said they'll put Letitia James in prison.
[00:53:53.679 --> 00:53:55.760]  Well, she ran on putting Trump in prison.
[00:53:57.239 --> 00:54:00.019]  She ran that she would set him up and find something.
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.099]  She started it.
[00:54:03.599 --> 00:54:07.360]  And so instead of being scared, oh God, don't say you'll bring him to justice.
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:09.960]  You do it.
[00:54:10.039 --> 00:54:11.480]  They're all over the news.
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:13.340]  I mean, here's another example of lies.
[00:54:14.289 --> 00:54:16.829]  I say don't respond to lies, but this one's really informative.
[00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:18.969]  This is a salon.
[00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:20.750]  This is all over the news.
[00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:21.909]  Media matters.
[00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:28.230]  Jones calls for Nuremberg 2 against Democrats following Trump win, and they go, it's crazy.
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:34.280]  Jones gives no examples of what we've done wrong, but he wants us all in prison.
[00:54:34.579 --> 00:54:36.400]  I didn't say put you all in prison.
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.579]  I gave tons of examples of what you've done wrong.
[00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:42.440]  They just show a 20-second clip out of context.
[00:54:42.619 --> 00:54:46.019]  And according to their deceptive clip, yeah, I didn't say why.
[00:54:46.239 --> 00:54:49.980]  Because they didn't take, say, the five-minute statement and show you that.
[00:54:50.099 --> 00:54:55.679]  Because if they showed you that, they would have heard me saying, we need to give amnesty to most of these people.
[00:54:55.679 --> 00:54:58.639]  We don't want to persecute the general mass of them, even though they deserve it.
[00:54:59.179 --> 00:55:00.599]  We need to go after the kingpins.
[00:55:00.719 --> 00:55:14.980]  We need to do Nuremberg 2 trials for their poison shots, for the human trafficking and smuggling of children, for the political persecution, for the illegal censorship that's a felony, for the violation of constitutional rights, the conspiracy.
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:23.539]  And I showed the laws on air, and I showed the precedent, and you read this and you'd think, man, this guy just wants to put everybody in prison for no reason.
[00:55:24.239 --> 00:55:26.760]  And I was responding to them saying, we're going to put them all in prison.
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:31.559]  No, you're trying to put us all in prison and turn the whole world into a giant prison.
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:33.719]  We're trying to stop you from doing it.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:39.400]  And if we've got to put some of your leaders in prison to get the rest of you to stop it and quit doing it, we will.
[00:55:39.539 --> 00:55:49.440]  But no, I don't take any pleasure thinking about Rachel Maddow in federal prison, though she lied to people when she knew the shot was poisoned and took millions of dollars to sit there and tell you that.
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:52.260]  So somebody should go to prison for that.
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:57.219]  I mean, they killed a lot of people and maimed a lot of people.
[00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:05.309]  So, again, I lean into this controversy about the...
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:07.980]  Press Secretary.
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:10.380]  I didn't really make a big deal about it when Don Jr.
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.260]  said it a year ago.
[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:15.840]  And then now that it was all over the place and trending, I said, sure, I'll accept the nomination from him.
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.019]  Because he nominated me.
[00:56:17.159 --> 00:56:18.800]  It's not an official nomination process.
[00:56:19.159 --> 00:56:20.800]  And Stubbs is like, it's fake news.
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:25.760]  Jones was not nominated to be the Press Secretary.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.280]  Well, there's not a nomination for that.
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:28.320]  You get hired by the President.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:33.139]  But it's a term, like, I nominate you to take out the garbage.
[00:56:34.119 --> 00:56:37.619]  Your mom's like, I nominate you to mow the yard.
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:44.500]  I remember a few times back when the Oscars, when I was a kid, my mom would still watch the Oscars when she thought they were cool.
[00:56:44.699 --> 00:56:46.199]  I guess they were kind of cool back then.
[00:56:46.719 --> 00:56:54.320]  They're like the most uncool thing for decades now, but I remember her like joking, I nominate you to clean up the dishes.
[00:56:56.599 --> 00:57:00.360]  See, I've been nominated, but see, oh God, Jones lied, he wasn't nominated.
[00:57:01.579 --> 00:57:11.940]  Again, they take terms of parlance, terms of, oh Trump said, put Cheney in front of a firing squad and kill her.
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:18.380]  No, he said the cliche, if she loves war so much, wants to send young people to die, she ought to go strap on battle armor and go face those guns.
[00:57:20.429 --> 00:57:24.889]  That's not she needs to have guns pointed at her, but that's the games they play.
[00:57:24.989 --> 00:57:26.289]  And look, we know that now.
[00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:42.809]  So we need to have a discussion, all of us, about at what point, like when you drive up at a red light, driving home from dinner at 9 o'clock at night, there's a schizophrenic homeless person Squatting on the ground, defecating, pointing at your car, saying, I'm telling you to learn.
[00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:44.409]  You've seen it.
[00:57:44.570 --> 00:57:45.250]  You live in a big city.
[00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:47.289]  Shut up, shut up.
[00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:50.949]  Or they're like cussing, or they're saying some word you can't make out.
[00:57:53.469 --> 00:57:55.650]  And do you roll out the window and say, I don't understand.
[00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:56.369]  What are you saying?
[00:57:57.849 --> 00:58:01.030]  Or the homeless person saying, F you, F you, F you.
[00:58:02.279 --> 00:58:03.360]  I had one a few months ago.
[00:58:03.559 --> 00:58:04.480]  It was, like, early in the morning.
[00:58:04.599 --> 00:58:08.119]  Like, I was driving work at, like, 8 a.m., and I'm in an underpass.
[00:58:08.199 --> 00:58:08.500]  I stop.
[00:58:08.639 --> 00:58:09.420]  I've seen this guy before.
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:12.460]  If you're on your cell phone, he screams at you and tells you to get off of it.
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:13.059]  He'll get a red light.
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:14.440]  I guess he knows me.
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:16.860]  He looks like a Yosemite Sam.
[00:58:18.369 --> 00:58:18.769]  Literally.
[00:58:18.769 --> 00:58:24.769]  And he starts going, he tells every car whenever he's riled up, F you, you're a criminal, you're going to jail, mother.
[00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:29.750]  Now, why would I roll the window down and say, I'm not a criminal, I'm not going to jail.
[00:58:29.949 --> 00:58:34.949]  No, that's a schizophrenic lunatic that I've seen off and on under that bridge for at least five years.
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:47.599]  And when I pull up there all the time, because that's on the way to work, I just make sure the window's up, I lock the door, and sometimes I get the visor thing and just put it to the side so I have to look at him, because sometimes he comes right over to the car.
[00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:54.369]  There's a big fat gypsy woman in another one of the stops that repeatedly comes up and thumps my window and I don't give her money.
[00:58:55.650 --> 00:59:02.849]  The point is, you don't roll down the window and say, let me have a discussion with you when you're telling me I'm going to jail and I'm an effing criminal.
[00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:09.690]  You know the person's schizophrenic out of their mind because you just watched them do it to the two cars in front of you by the time they got down to you.
[00:59:10.519 --> 00:59:20.840]  So at what point is Nancy Pelosi and Rachel Maddow with their big facades of power and their TV shows and their big sets, at what point are they the equivalent of the crazy homeless person?
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:27.400]  And I'm just simply saying, we keep responding to them, and I'm here doing it too.
[00:59:30.079 --> 00:59:32.619]  And at this point, it's kind of gotten fun to do.
[00:59:33.139 --> 00:59:33.780]  You know?
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:36.199]  But it's not funny.
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:39.860]  It's not funny to roll down the window and say, yes sir, why am I going to prison?
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:40.639]  Why are you upset?
[00:59:41.119 --> 00:59:42.820]  And then he'd probably bite me or something.
[00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:48.800]  You know, my cousin in Seattle worked for Microsoft.
[00:59:49.079 --> 00:59:49.760]  Great guy.
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:51.199]  Super smart.
[00:59:51.699 --> 00:59:52.619]  Grew up with him in Dallas.
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:56.699]  Jamie.
[00:59:59.099 --> 01:00:00.460]  Coming out of Microsoft.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.780]  This has got to be 15 years ago.
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.500]  He's been dead for 10.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.480]  Took him five years to die from it.
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:06.599]  Great shape, everything.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.920]  Homeless person said, give me some money.
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.519]  He hands him a $20 bill.
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:18.420]  And the other homeless person jumped on him and almost bit his thumb off.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.880]  And then the infection from that almost killed him.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.860]  Ate a bunch of his, you know, part of his organs.
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.039]  He was in the hospital, swole up, looked like a dead whale.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.500]  He lived, but then complications killed him five years later.
[01:00:34.119 --> 01:00:38.179]  So, I mean, when I tell you, probably get bit by a homeless person, there's a real story.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.280]  A homeless person, like Day of the Dead, killed my cousin.
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.320]  Took five years to do it, but that's what killed him.
[01:00:47.199 --> 01:00:59.360]  So, again, even engaging Maddow or Pelosi or AOC or Beto O'Rourke or Klaus Schwab or King Charles is like debating with a schizophrenic homeless person.
[01:01:00.659 --> 01:01:03.699]  And you see the left and their freakout videos, how crazy they are.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.019]  It's not hard to find that.
[01:01:05.119 --> 01:01:06.099]  I live in Austin, Texas.
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.079]  You go into leftist areas or you go into a Democratic event, we go cover them.
[01:01:10.239 --> 01:01:17.099]  I mean, they are all on a bunch of psychotropic drugs, whacked out of their brains, howling, screaming, praising Satan.
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.099]  Just, they're gone, people.
[01:01:20.619 --> 01:01:31.030]  So again, why are we going to let People like that dictate to us, and why are we going to engage them, and why are we going to care about them?
[01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:49.639]  So here I am, pointing out that if Trump has people around him that care what the corporate media says, And if he brings in any establishment Republicans around him, he's got a big problem.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.539]  But here's his problem.
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.980]  Some people say, yeah, Trump better get all good, perfect people.
[01:01:53.719 --> 01:02:00.679]  Anybody that's a real patriot like Flynn or Bannon, they are instantly going to try to indict or attack.
[01:02:01.119 --> 01:02:04.059]  Well, that's why the first thing he's got to do is get control of the Justice Department.
[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:12.159]  And then, of course, Trump...
[01:02:13.469 --> 01:02:16.989]  One, because he had the poll watchers and the people, and we supported him, and I've already said that.
[01:02:17.849 --> 01:02:21.530]  And he survived that incredible assassination attempt in front of everyone.
[01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:24.510]  And the left, I saw him again doing it this morning.
[01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:26.610]  In fact, I'm going to send you guys a video I didn't see on my list.
[01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:35.750]  This new thing, you know Trump really wasn't shot because the bullet that hit his ear was this big.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:42.400]  And of course, he's talking about like a three and a half inch long 5.56 casing and round.
[01:02:42.699 --> 01:02:45.539]  No, the casing, sweetheart, doesn't get fired out of the barrel.
[01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:47.480]  It's the little.22 caliber bullet.
[01:02:49.119 --> 01:02:54.840]  And that is going straight on and just basically barely touches you.
[01:02:55.039 --> 01:02:57.019]  You just get a nick.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.460]  But again, I was watching this guy in this new talking point.
[01:03:02.559 --> 01:03:03.059]  Did you see it everywhere?
[01:03:03.639 --> 01:03:04.679]  They're back with it.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.860]  They know that's not true.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:11.360]  They're going for low information people that actually go, yeah!
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:20.539]  Hey guys, there's a.50 caliber round bottle opener in there in the maintenance desk I saw the other day.
[01:03:20.599 --> 01:03:21.400]  It's mine.
[01:03:21.599 --> 01:03:22.980]  I don't know how it got over there.
[01:03:23.679 --> 01:03:25.199]  But I want to show people that.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:33.730]  I think we got a 5.56 around here too, but I want to explain to liberals and leftists When you got a big old cartridge, it's the bullets on the end.
[01:03:33.889 --> 01:03:35.750]  You don't fire the whole thing down the deal.
[01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:38.429]  And...
[01:03:38.429 --> 01:03:40.670]  Okay, we got a bullet here, but we got a cartridge.
[01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:42.469]  So...
[01:03:42.469 --> 01:03:44.989]  But at a certain point, again...
[01:03:44.989 --> 01:03:45.710]  Thank you.
[01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:47.210]  Yeah, that's a 5-5-6.
[01:03:47.489 --> 01:03:48.429]  That's a 2-2-3.
[01:03:50.289 --> 01:03:51.510]  That's a smaller grain one too.
[01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:56.389]  So, they're on TV going, Trump got hit with this and his ear wasn't blown off.
[01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:57.309]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:03:57.809 --> 01:04:01.010]  I know the regular listeners are laughing and this is not for you, but look.
[01:04:01.489 --> 01:04:03.070]  This is the bullet right here.
[01:04:03.809 --> 01:04:04.929]  See the soft point?
[01:04:05.369 --> 01:04:06.269]  It's aerodynamic.
[01:04:06.269 --> 01:04:06.889]  It mushrooms.
[01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:08.289]  It opens up when it goes in.
[01:04:08.389 --> 01:04:10.329]  It causes a bigger wound cavity.
[01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:11.610]  It's a small bullet.
[01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:12.190]  It needs that.
[01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:15.289]  If it didn't have that, it'd be a full metal jacket.
[01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:16.949]  This is the brass casing.
[01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:22.980]  There's an explosive Detonating charge called the cap right there.
[01:04:23.199 --> 01:04:24.500]  The hammer hits that.
[01:04:24.679 --> 01:04:26.880]  It detonates it as an explosion.
[01:04:27.139 --> 01:04:33.280]  That explosion detonates the white powder that was invented about 190 years ago in here.
[01:04:33.539 --> 01:04:41.219]  It forces that gas out through the cartridge that's inside the barrel of the gun.
[01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:49.090]  And then it forces that bullet through rifling so it spins down the barrel.
[01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:54.269]  And that little bullet goes out and hits its target.
[01:04:54.429 --> 01:04:58.230]  And at 2,600 feet a second when it first comes out.
[01:04:58.590 --> 01:04:59.250]  So, so, so explain.
[01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:00.550]  Here's Trump's ear.
[01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:02.150]  Okay?
[01:05:02.409 --> 01:05:06.909]  And the bullet goes like this and nicks him.
[01:05:10.090 --> 01:05:11.949]  And then that just creates a cut.
[01:05:13.070 --> 01:05:26.829]  Okay, if it hits him in the nose or the head, the bullet goes in, not the cartridge, the bullet, and then it goes through the skull, little hole, just like Kennedy.
[01:05:26.829 --> 01:05:33.550]  He was probably shot more like a.308 or.30-06, more high-powered, larger bullet, but still, same effect.
[01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:37.130]  Goes in, the head's like a pumpkin.
[01:05:39.059 --> 01:05:49.579]  So then it expands, hits the brain, creates pressure and gas, that expands, and then the top and the back of the head blows out from the pressure.
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.739]  Let's show them the Zabruder film and explain to them.
[01:05:52.199 --> 01:06:16.139]  So, if Trump would have been hit over just a few millimeters, it would have hit him in the skull, and then the bullet would have mushroomed right here, And blown his eyeball out the side and shrapnel pieces of the breaking up 5.56 bullet would have gone into his brain.
[01:06:17.219 --> 01:06:19.280]  And then you'd have the side of his head blow off.
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:23.480]  Okay, so that's how this works.
[01:06:24.119 --> 01:06:26.179]  You can go shoot pumpkins and see for yourself.
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.900]  You can sit there and shoot by the edge of a pumpkin.
[01:06:29.019 --> 01:06:35.559]  If you're a good enough shot, you can hit it just perfectly and you'll go and look at the pumpkin and there'll be like a little bitty scratch on the side of the pumpkin.
[01:06:37.889 --> 01:06:39.030]  That's called grazing.
[01:06:40.929 --> 01:06:42.929]  And I know I'm digressing.
[01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:45.349]  It's just that...
[01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:47.869]  Actually, here's a.50 cal.
[01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:53.610]  So see, when you fire this out of a.50 caliber barrel, same thing.
[01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:59.869]  A pin hits this, detonates it, ignites the white powder, forces the projectile.
[01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:00.969]  This is the bullet.
[01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:03.050]  This part, not this.
[01:07:03.409 --> 01:07:04.989]  And then this goes at its target.
[01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:07.329]  And this is a full metal jacket.
[01:07:08.699 --> 01:07:12.760]  This is a pistol or handgun cartridge.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.119]  This is a 9mm.
[01:07:17.179 --> 01:07:18.380]  Same thing.
[01:07:18.719 --> 01:07:26.980]  Detonates the cap, fires the powder, sends the projectile down the barrel, and handguns are lower velocity.
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:29.900]  Less powder.
[01:07:31.659 --> 01:07:39.909]  Here is a.22 Cartridge.
[01:07:39.909 --> 01:07:41.269]  That might be long rifle.
[01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:44.250]  And it's the same thing.
[01:07:45.269 --> 01:07:51.409]  But most of these are rimfire, meaning, for a reason, it doesn't hit in the middle, it's on the side, but detonates it.
[01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.989]  Okay?
[01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:56.289]  So when you fire one of these, it doesn't shoot the back out, it shoots that.
[01:07:56.769 --> 01:07:59.309]  This is the projectile right here on the front, okay?
[01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:00.630]  Sorry, I didn't mean to digress.
[01:08:01.989 --> 01:08:05.650]  And again, I'm going to shoot a report like five minutes for Trump where I cut to the chase and get to all this.
[01:08:05.730 --> 01:08:09.329]  But that's why the problem describing all this would just take 100 years.
[01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:15.409]  Because it's just, you know, street smarts, basic knowledge.
[01:08:17.329 --> 01:08:19.069]  Yeah, see, that's the back of a pumpkin.
[01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:22.590]  It's all blown out, not the front of the pumpkin.
[01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:28.250]  Little hole in the front, little hole in the entry wound, big hole on the back.
[01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:30.070]  Okay?
[01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:32.109]  Now, I'm not talking to our regular listeners.
[01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:37.029]  I apologize for, you know, it's equivalent to telling people how to wipe their ass or use the potty.
[01:08:37.869 --> 01:08:40.229]  I mean, quite frankly, I think two-year-olds would know this better.
[01:08:40.989 --> 01:08:44.390]  But that's where we are.
[01:08:45.569 --> 01:08:51.649]  So, I need to do like a quick five-minute video where I just go, bam, bam, bam, this is why you won, this is why you won.
[01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:54.770]  But the biggest thing is the public stopped buying into the intimidation and the bullying.
[01:08:55.069 --> 01:08:58.289]  Realized it's all a paper tiger of Assad, Wizard of Oz, man behind the curtain.
[01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:02.630]  Trump's an incredible guy, had incredible energy, stamina.
[01:09:03.369 --> 01:09:05.449]  The people they ran against him were complete demons.
[01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:08.210]  The globalists want to collapse society to consolidate control.
[01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:13.710]  They thought that we would know it was them doing it, even though they bragged publicly how they're doing it.
[01:09:14.829 --> 01:09:24.090]  And we've got an incredible opportunity now if Trump gets more hardcore and goes in and just absolutely says, this is an occupied government.
[01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:25.470]  These people are all frauds.
[01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:26.729]  I don't give a damn what they say.
[01:09:26.869 --> 01:09:27.590]  I'm reporting to you.
[01:09:27.710 --> 01:09:30.350]  Just ignore them and just move on.
[01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:34.310]  And then obviously do stuff like make me the White House press secretary.
[01:09:34.710 --> 01:09:36.770]  I mean, that's not even something you question.
[01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:37.430]  You do that.
[01:09:38.069 --> 01:09:39.590]  And that's why it's so explosive.
[01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:41.869]  People are just everywhere freaking out, wanting it.
[01:09:42.029 --> 01:09:42.890]  It's a sensation.
[01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:45.850]  Because it's the ultimate F you to the system.
[01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:48.729]  And it just means your control's over.
[01:09:49.949 --> 01:09:51.850]  We do the opposite of what you want.
[01:09:52.050 --> 01:09:54.850]  You know how horrified the left is of me being the press secretary?
[01:09:56.489 --> 01:10:01.970]  Not just because of what they think I'll do and how I'll embarrass them and how informed I am.
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.359]  It's the F you.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.479]  It's the not caring.
[01:10:05.659 --> 01:10:07.640]  It's that that could happen itself.
[01:10:08.579 --> 01:10:09.699]  Getting Trump in.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:12.060]  Overriding the attempted assassinations.
[01:10:12.279 --> 01:10:13.300]  All the big corporate money.
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:14.600]  The Bill Gates money.
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:19.640]  The big tech being fully behind Kamala.
[01:10:20.699 --> 01:10:23.939]  The establishment failed across the board.
[01:10:24.199 --> 01:10:24.979]  They're a joke.
[01:10:25.159 --> 01:10:26.979]  And they already knew they'd been a joke for decades.
[01:10:26.979 --> 01:10:28.579]  But now everybody knows.
[01:10:30.539 --> 01:10:32.079]  You don't think the man behind the curtain...
[01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:38.189]  Doesn't know he's not powerful.
[01:10:38.989 --> 01:10:43.850]  His only power is convincing you he's got power, is the illusion of power.
[01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:45.930]  And again, you're saying, yeah, yeah, we know this.
[01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:48.590]  Yeah, because you're listening to this show.
[01:10:48.850 --> 01:10:50.590]  You came and found this show because you were already informed.
[01:10:51.010 --> 01:10:52.710]  You don't tune in here to really learn anything.
[01:10:52.930 --> 01:11:02.409]  You just tune in because you know it's accurate and maybe you learn something and somebody else comes on, you learn something, and then you call and you add something.
[01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.909]  I get it.
[01:11:04.239 --> 01:11:10.979]  But then I'm asking, what are you doing to go out and wake up others and show them how this crap works?
[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:21.260]  So, the toto moment's already happened with Trump.
[01:11:24.039 --> 01:11:32.600]  And now we gotta go to the man behind the curtain, or his people, the man behind the curtain's really evil, but his people, and say, hey, Knock it off.
[01:11:32.779 --> 01:11:33.659]  We'll give you amnesty.
[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:34.880]  Quit it.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.140]  Your boss has got to go to prison.
[01:11:38.239 --> 01:11:42.079]  And then, you know, by the end of it, the man behind the curtains, you know, helping him go back to Kansas.
[01:11:42.899 --> 01:11:43.920]  Go back to America.
[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:44.899]  Go back to the future.
[01:11:46.899 --> 01:11:52.659]  So, and of course, really what happened was, things are dangerous.
[01:11:52.819 --> 01:11:53.659]  Things are falling apart.
[01:11:53.819 --> 01:11:54.460]  Things are crazy.
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.380]  And people really...
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:03.220]  Have experienced enough tyranny now, and they saw it getting worse and worse to go, whoa, this is really about survival and common sense.
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:04.159]  We can't do this.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:11.420]  But that said, what I am getting from the public and most of the listeners is, no more war.
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.159]  We fixed it.
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:13.420]  The economy's going to be great.
[01:12:13.939 --> 01:12:14.659]  Everything's fine.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:25.510]  And if you think that, and I got a bunch of news I'm about to hit showing you that, if you think these cornered rats are going to give up completely and You're crazy.
[01:12:26.069 --> 01:12:27.829]  Yeah, a lot of them have thrown in the towel already.
[01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:28.869]  A lot of them have rolled over.
[01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:31.250]  A lot of their minions now know they've bet on the wrong team.
[01:12:31.449 --> 01:12:36.289]  A lot of people that weren't really consciously evil but had gone along with it have said, hey, they were wrong.
[01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:37.949]  So yeah, we've got the initiative.
[01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:38.470]  We're winning.
[01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:39.189]  Things are happening.
[01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:43.390]  But there's large groups of these people that are psychotic.
[01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:46.010]  And they're not going to give up.
[01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:49.449]  You think Alexander Soros is going to give up?
[01:12:51.689 --> 01:12:52.409]  You think the...
[01:12:53.579 --> 01:12:55.039]  People like Pompeo are going to give up.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:06.180]  And so, you can say it's 3D chess with Trump, you know, if he brings Bill Gates around or Pompeo, and no, it's not.
[01:13:07.819 --> 01:13:09.920]  Caller called in Friday and said, well, or it was Thursday.
[01:13:10.319 --> 01:13:17.739]  Well, it's like, you know, when Trump beat Romney, he brought him in and, you know, campaigned for him for the Senate and all that, because, you know, he was keeping his enemy closer.
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:30.460]  No, he thought in business, because there's a lot of scams in low-level business, but in big business, stuff like that, real estate, hotels, golf courses, you screw people, your name gets bad, nobody does business with you.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:38.979]  So Trump was just used his whole life to working with quality people and bringing people in, and that they did a good job promoting them.
[01:13:39.159 --> 01:13:44.340]  And so he thought, well, Romney's worked for them, but if I get him in the U.S. Senate, he'll be nice.
[01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:47.020]  Trump tried to, and they would all lie to his face.
[01:13:50.069 --> 01:13:51.229]  Because they're globalists.
[01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:52.689]  Because they're evil.
[01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:53.970]  They serve the devil.
[01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:56.050]  They've got a larger globalist plan.
[01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:57.210]  They're in a cult.
[01:13:58.989 --> 01:14:08.409]  This isn't like you beat somebody for a contract to get a certain piece of property, build a hotel, and then later you say, hey, that's all right.
[01:14:08.529 --> 01:14:12.310]  I'll hire your company to, you know, run the golf course next door.
[01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:16.569]  No, it's not like that.
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:20.479]  They want total control.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.859]  And Trump doesn't come from their club.
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:26.899]  It's about power over the people.
[01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:28.359]  He wants prosperity.
[01:14:28.579 --> 01:14:29.579]  They don't want prosperity.
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.239]  They want austerity.
[01:14:31.359 --> 01:14:32.340]  They want the Great Reset.
[01:14:33.659 --> 01:14:39.010]  So Bill Gates gave $50 million And that's just because he got caught in that one.
[01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:42.890]  Folks, Bill Gates is a conduit for globalists, just like Soros.
[01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:45.770]  Bill Gates, on record, I forget the number.
[01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:51.350]  I mean, I think he gives $2 billion a year to media in North America alone.
[01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:54.189]  And I saw one year was like $6 billion globally.
[01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:58.350]  He spends money in China, India, South Africa, all over Europe.
[01:14:59.710 --> 01:15:05.829]  Most of the time, as I read news all day, you read like an ABC News story about how great vaccines are and how bad Alex Jones is or RFK Jr.
[01:15:06.090 --> 01:15:09.670]  And it'll say at the bottom, this was underwritten by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:15:09.949 --> 01:15:11.789]  They put frickin' tags on it.
[01:15:13.829 --> 01:15:16.750]  He didn't give 50 million to Kamala Harris.
[01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:19.489]  I bet he gave 200 million to her.
[01:15:22.369 --> 01:15:26.989]  Bill Gates went around the last 30 years and bought up all the major regulatory groups in the world.
[01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:28.949]  Over medicine.
[01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:32.829]  He's got a plan to chemtrail the skies, block out the sun.
[01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:38.149]  He's released billions of mosquitoes in Latin America and the U.S., all linked to all sorts of stuff, GMO mosquitoes.
[01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:47.949]  I mean, if they made a Marvel comic movie about some mad scientist guy that did all this, people would say, that's not real.
[01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:50.630]  You know, someone wouldn't get away with that much stuff.
[01:15:51.149 --> 01:15:54.010]  I mean, this guy, this guy's insane.
[01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:58.630]  His dad was the head of the World Eugenics Society and Planned Parenthood.
[01:15:58.869 --> 01:16:03.689]  He's the head of the World Eugenics Society, now called the Global Population Control Fund.
[01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:08.109]  That's the real name on the paperwork for Bill Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:14.010]  Then of course he gives you a COVID gene therapy that attacks your ovaries and testicles.
[01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:15.310]  What the hell you think he's up to?
[01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:20.850]  And notice he does a microcosm 15 years ago.
[01:16:20.970 --> 01:16:22.430]  He releases a bunch of mosquitoes on a crowd.
[01:16:25.090 --> 01:16:28.630]  But just type in, Bill Gates releases GMO mosquitoes in Brazil.
[01:16:28.890 --> 01:16:31.289]  Bill Gates releases GMO mosquitoes in Florida.
[01:16:31.689 --> 01:16:33.750]  Bill Gates releases GMO mosquitoes in Texas.
[01:16:34.949 --> 01:16:36.010]  Look up the headlines.
[01:16:37.829 --> 01:16:41.430]  It's all about raping you, pushing a poison shot on you.
[01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:43.329]  And now they've got lettuce.
[01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:44.390]  In fact, get the clip.
[01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:47.489]  I want to show you the article that's on M4s of Thomas Massey.
[01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:55.039]  Last week, they're trying to pass a law to give the money and then to authorize Pharmacological crops.
[01:16:55.399 --> 01:16:58.619]  You're like, well, how do you grow a vaccine in a tomato?
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.460]  It's not a vaccine.
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:13.600]  The old definition for the last 300 years is you give someone something, a small amount of it, so that your body learns how to beat a lot of it.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:33.680]  Because before they even knew about microbes, It was like a wives' tale, take some of the pus from a cow that has smallpox in the summer, because any people were healthier in the summer, prick them with a toothpick under the skin of your kid, so they get the one boil, and then they won't get it for the first time in the winter when they're malnourished and die.
[01:17:35.779 --> 01:17:37.260]  And you can still die from that.
[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:45.439]  And then they discover microbes, you know, 160 years ago, or 160.
[01:17:46.409 --> 01:17:51.170]  And then they come up with, and so they microwave or radiate a virus.
[01:17:51.909 --> 01:17:52.810]  They put it in you.
[01:17:52.869 --> 01:17:54.130]  Your body learns how to beat it.
[01:17:54.569 --> 01:17:55.789]  You get an immunity to it.
[01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:59.029]  Got side effects, but it's real.
[01:17:59.449 --> 01:18:01.649]  The new definition is just anything we put in your body.
[01:18:01.909 --> 01:18:04.890]  Well, I could have cyanide and go, here's your vaccine.
[01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:08.010]  It's a gene therapy.
[01:18:12.970 --> 01:18:14.210]  Well, how do they grow it in tomato?
[01:18:14.710 --> 01:18:23.729]  Did you know that many of the drugs you take and many of the vaccines you take that are vaccines that have live virus in them are grown in plants?
[01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:32.590]  Did you know plants are so incredible that they, for 30 years we know of, have been genetically engineering plants to grow all sorts of things?
[01:18:33.489 --> 01:18:33.670]  So...
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:53.100]  Bill Gates now wants to be Donald Trump's friend.
[01:18:53.239 --> 01:18:54.159]  I'll show you the article.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:01.979]  By the way, a new viewer, you say, oh yeah, Bill Gates has a plan to block out the sun.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:05.199]  He already directs the Department of Energy unofficially.
[01:19:05.319 --> 01:19:07.119]  You go, wait, he's not the Department of Energy.
[01:19:07.119 --> 01:19:08.520]  He wasn't approved by the Senate.
[01:19:09.199 --> 01:19:11.479]  Yeah, and he runs the UN vaccine program too.
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.260]  Wasn't approved there.
[01:19:13.789 --> 01:19:30.949]  You want me to show you a newscast where he, for 20 years, admits they run a Department of Energy program to have aluminum salts, aluminum dioxide, barium, silver dioxide put in the jet fuel, and then the jet engines put it out and it creates nuclei to form clouds.
[01:19:32.930 --> 01:19:38.229]  Oh, it's not, most of it's not spray planes from the Air Force where they know they're doing it officially.
[01:19:38.409 --> 01:19:39.130]  They have those too.
[01:19:40.149 --> 01:19:41.949]  99% of it's commercial aircraft.
[01:19:44.130 --> 01:19:49.090]  And it's the kerosene makers that have the deals with the Department of Energy to do it.
[01:19:52.649 --> 01:20:03.050]  That's why you can be sitting out in the summer and watch planes come in and they're forming condensation trails when you only saw that in the winter when you were a kid, you notice.
[01:20:04.869 --> 01:20:07.090]  Because those aren't normal ice crystals.
[01:20:08.569 --> 01:20:12.390]  But you'll see a plane right next to it that didn't get the mix and it's not leaving them.
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:19.000]  And it's an admitted program, but then they say you're crazy if you talk about it.
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:20.880]  It's all on record.
[01:20:27.039 --> 01:20:29.380]  Yeah, here's Massey talking about the frankincrops.
[01:20:29.579 --> 01:20:29.760]  Here it is.
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:39.180]  Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:56.699]  Does the term transgenic edible vaccine sound far-fetched?
[01:20:56.899 --> 01:20:58.039]  Well, it's not.
[01:20:59.090 --> 01:21:00.109]  We're funding it.
[01:21:00.329 --> 01:21:18.710]  In fact, scientists from the University of California Riverside, funded with your taxpayer dollars, have been studying whether they can turn edible plants, such as lettuce and spinach, into mRNA vaccine factories, thereby creating a transgenic edible vaccine.
[01:21:19.399 --> 01:21:27.140]  One associate professor at UCR explained that ideally a single plant would produce enough mRNA to vaccinate a single person.
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:33.420]  We are testing this approach with spinach and lettuce and have long-term goals of people growing it in their own gardens.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:37.180]  Farmers could also eventually grow entire fields of it.
[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.500]  I don't think this is a good idea.
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:43.399]  I don't think the American people should be funding this.
[01:21:43.579 --> 01:21:54.380]  And I think, and I would hope, that we've learned something from the COVID experience with SARS-CoV-2, that some of our science projects aren't the best ideas.
[01:21:54.539 --> 01:21:55.699]  And with that, I reserve.
[01:21:57.279 --> 01:21:59.220]  The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized.
[01:22:00.069 --> 01:22:03.569]  Well, my colleague on the other side of the aisle talks about keeping prices low.
[01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:07.289]  I think there's more to it than that for the American people.
[01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:15.010]  And he also speaks as if these vaccines, these transgenic edible plant vaccines, are only used for livestock.
[01:22:15.010 --> 01:22:17.569]  Well, in fact, they have been used for livestock.
[01:22:17.569 --> 01:22:18.890]  I'll get to that in a second.
[01:22:19.109 --> 01:22:21.649]  But they're also being used for people.
[01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:31.949]  That is the intended outcome of many of these programs that we are funding, funding with money from the USDA. What could possibly go wrong with this research?
[01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:42.819]  Well, we found out a few years ago when a biotech company was experimenting Growing in corn a vaccine to keep pigs from getting diarrhea.
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:44.260]  What happened?
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:53.420]  Well, the next year where the corn was grown, the prior year the corn came up and it got co-mingled with soybeans that were being grown there.
[01:22:53.659 --> 01:23:00.760]  It contaminated 500 bushels of soybeans, which were then co-mingled with 500,000 bushels of soybeans.
[01:23:01.579 --> 01:23:03.840]  And those all had to be recalled and destroyed.
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:05.699]  Luckily, they caught it.
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:12.220]  Do we want humans eating vaccines that were grown in corn meant to stop pigs from getting diarrhea?
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.279]  I don't think we want that to happen.
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:17.319]  Yet that almost happened, and it could happen.
[01:23:18.039 --> 01:23:26.319]  There's another case where the pollen cross-contaminated another crop of corn and 155 acres of corn had to be burned.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:30.000]  What are the cases where we're not discovering this?
[01:23:30.199 --> 01:23:33.420]  I think it's dangerous to play God with our food.
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.840]  I think we need a safe food supply.
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:39.260]  And this is about food safety.
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:45.340]  Ultimately, the people in this country need to know what's in their food.
[01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:54.350]  And if we start contaminating the DNA of our food with DNA from other animals or viruses, the pollen can spread.
[01:23:55.449 --> 01:23:56.930]  And we don't know what could happen.
[01:23:57.250 --> 01:24:03.010]  And I would hope we've learned a lesson from the Wuhan lab that sometimes things escape.
[01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:04.909]  Sometimes things don't go as you plan.
[01:24:05.210 --> 01:24:16.510]  And so that's why I think it's a bad idea to fund transgenic edible plant vaccine research from the USDA. I urge adoption of my amendment and I yield back the balance of my time.
[01:24:16.909 --> 01:24:20.289]  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kentucky.
[01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:22.090]  Those in favor say aye.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.039]  Does the polls say no?
[01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:28.619]  In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it.
[01:24:28.819 --> 01:24:30.380]  The amendment is agreed to.
[01:24:30.859 --> 01:24:31.500]  All right.
[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:38.020]  I remember 20 years ago, it was about 20 years ago, National News attacked me saying, Alex Jones is crazy.
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:40.020]  He says there's vaccines in these crops.
[01:24:40.779 --> 01:24:46.500]  And I was covering a local Texas paper, it was a Houston Chronicle, about north of Austin.
[01:24:47.810 --> 01:25:04.569]  The company was called Protogen, if I remember correctly, and it was on the news, guys in spacesuits having to burn it because it had contaminated other fields, cornfields, and the corn was growing live HIV virus, and they were isolating the spike protein out of it,
[01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:10.909]  oh, for use in other things, like we saw what happened a few years ago, and then it just left the news.
[01:25:11.979 --> 01:25:15.039]  And then I'm like, what are they doing growing live HIV and corn?
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:18.520]  That could jump into other cornfields, which it did.
[01:25:19.899 --> 01:25:23.220]  And imagine how many of these things you don't know about.
[01:25:23.399 --> 01:25:24.659]  And it's like, oh, Jones is crazy.
[01:25:24.859 --> 01:25:28.680]  It's atrazine, you know, makes the majority of frogs that get exposed to it.
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:30.800]  Try to have sex with male frogs.
[01:25:32.539 --> 01:25:35.800]  Makes some gay, makes others trans where they grow female organs.
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:38.680]  People always say, Jones was wrong.
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:39.680]  They're trans, not gay.
[01:25:39.779 --> 01:25:40.340]  No, it does both.
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:42.619]  I had the damn professors on the show.
[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:45.380]  Again, 15, 20 years ago.
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:49.439]  So, I'm sorry all this stuff sounds crazy.
[01:25:49.439 --> 01:25:50.840]  I'm not the one doing it.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:51.640]  They're doing it.
[01:25:51.699 --> 01:25:52.960]  I'm simply pointing it out.
[01:25:53.319 --> 01:25:57.340]  I can show the former CIA director on Obama saying, yeah, we control the weather.
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.739]  We're spraying with stubborn skies and other jet engines.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:00.239]  A big deal.
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:09.699]  So, we've got to stop putting up with this crap.
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:10.739]  Now, I got...
[01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:14.250]  No exaggeration, more than 35 clips here.
[01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:16.029]  I've got all this news I haven't hit yet.
[01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:18.789]  And I've just done an hour and 28 minutes live here.
[01:26:19.029 --> 01:26:22.810]  And a lot of folks are tuned in at RealAlexJones and InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:31.350]  And pan out video and ask all of you, take that live link and on your X, on your email, on your text message, share it and say, Alex Jones is on air covering really important stuff.
[01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:49.800]  And then I would encourage all of you with your crowdsourcing knowledge better than mine, To take the last hour where I talked about what Trump should do, and you take the best parts of that, and edit it down to 10 minutes, and you say Alex Jones' emergency message of what Trump needs to do.
[01:26:50.699 --> 01:26:51.920]  And he'll probably see it.
[01:26:52.239 --> 01:26:55.359]  But I'll shoot in the next few days a hard focus report.
[01:26:55.739 --> 01:27:01.619]  I'm kind of just brainstorming here live on air, but there's so many points, it's hard for me to get it down to just the most important to tell him.
[01:27:01.659 --> 01:27:02.819]  I think you'd be better deciding.
[01:27:02.979 --> 01:27:03.720]  I'm serious.
[01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:10.390]  You guys all the time, and you know who you are, Thousands of channels I see doing it.
[01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:11.810]  Hundreds that I know well.
[01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:18.449]  You'll put out edits of what I've said way better than I could do and way better than I do live.
[01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:21.850]  Or you've heard what I said.
[01:27:21.890 --> 01:27:25.529]  If you agree with me or maybe you've got better ideas for Trump, you go tell him what he should do.
[01:27:25.630 --> 01:27:26.170]  He listens.
[01:27:27.050 --> 01:27:28.189]  I just know this.
[01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:33.750]  Bowing down to the system and caring what they say and oh my God, all of this is not what the people want.
[01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:34.810]  People are angry.
[01:27:34.949 --> 01:27:35.489]  They're upset.
[01:27:35.770 --> 01:27:36.529]  They want change.
[01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:40.109]  And anything the globalists are pushing, we should be against.
[01:27:40.869 --> 01:27:42.569]  You'll own nothing and be happy?
[01:27:42.829 --> 01:27:44.170]  B.S. You'll eat bugs?
[01:27:44.350 --> 01:27:44.569]  Bull.
[01:27:45.090 --> 01:27:55.529]  Well, they said that five years ago and last year in Europe and the U.S., almost every major food producer now puts bug protein in your food.
[01:27:56.050 --> 01:27:57.829]  Cereal, the breading on chicken.
[01:27:58.630 --> 01:27:59.909]  I've done stories on it.
[01:27:59.970 --> 01:28:00.630]  It's insane.
[01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:17.569]  And I'm not a big junk food guy, but there are TV dinners and stuff I've been eating since I was a kid that I'll buy a couple of, you know, when I don't want to cook dinner, my wife's out of town, and I went and looked at them all in the last year, and they've all got bug protein in them.
[01:28:18.649 --> 01:28:20.630]  It doesn't say bug protein, it gives it a code.
[01:28:22.489 --> 01:28:27.250]  And you've got to, you know, all the Hollywood people for the last decade, oh, bugs are so good, eat them.
[01:28:28.539 --> 01:28:29.680]  Maggot milk's the way to go.
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:30.399]  It's toxic.
[01:28:30.399 --> 01:28:31.100]  It's garbage.
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:35.659]  They want to ban beef and pork and all that regular protein and make you eat this crap.
[01:28:37.119 --> 01:28:47.239]  Did you know for four years in the United States, they don't have to mark GMO salmon, genetically engineered, on your plate?
[01:28:47.279 --> 01:28:48.380]  It's very toxic.
[01:28:48.659 --> 01:28:52.100]  They put insect genes into the fish.
[01:28:52.119 --> 01:28:53.680]  It grows twice as fast.
[01:28:53.819 --> 01:28:54.960]  They've gotten into the ocean.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.239]  They kill the other salmon and they're taking over.
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:01.119]  So Massey's like, imagine what else could happen.
[01:29:01.119 --> 01:29:02.319]  Imagine what we don't know.
[01:29:02.479 --> 01:29:03.000]  I don't know.
[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:04.680]  I know a whole lot of really bad stuff.
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:12.279]  I could talk for an hour about stuff off the top of my head and you could take every damn bit of it and type it in and it's admitted.
[01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:19.720]  Like, GMO salmon now being sold in stores nationwide without markings.
[01:29:20.829 --> 01:29:23.789]  Then you look up the type of salmon and you can look up everything I just told you.
[01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:26.869]  Grows twice as fast, twice as big, super aggressive.
[01:29:27.210 --> 01:29:28.109]  It's gotten in the ocean.
[01:29:28.329 --> 01:29:29.390]  It's killing the other fish.
[01:29:30.689 --> 01:29:36.289]  How the hell did it get out of those tanks where they grow it and get into the ocean?
[01:29:36.710 --> 01:29:38.329]  You think an Easter bunny put them there?
[01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:40.170]  You think the Lucky Charms elf did that?
[01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:42.630]  This is a revolution against the earth.
[01:29:42.850 --> 01:29:45.390]  It's a transhumanist mad scientist crazy town.
[01:29:47.329 --> 01:29:54.720]  I said in February of 2000, That the COVID vaccine will give people false positives for AIDS. And now that's in the news.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:58.420]  Because it ain't false positives for AIDS. You got a different type of it.
[01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:02.140]  Vaccine-induced autoimmune disorder.
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:05.600]  There it is.
[01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:06.439]  See?
[01:30:06.859 --> 01:30:08.020]  Drew just typed in what I said.
[01:30:09.539 --> 01:30:11.899]  Genetically modified salmon will kill regular salmon.
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:12.720]  And they already are.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:15.579]  See, that's 2011.
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:19.979]  Yeah, in tests they did it, now they're in the ocean.
[01:30:20.939 --> 01:30:24.560]  Crew found a story from 13 years ago.
[01:30:25.939 --> 01:30:29.859]  And then you can find the stories where they got in the ocean, and now you're eating them.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.060]  And they don't tell you.
[01:30:31.699 --> 01:30:33.279]  Everything I tell you is on record.
[01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:40.779]  Even when I tell you, God just told me Trump will announce at 1.27.
[01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:43.960]  I'm not sure the time zone, I'm just told 1.27.
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:46.159]  Trump comes out, 1.27.
[01:30:47.789 --> 01:30:49.270]  Now, do I make those calls other times?
[01:30:49.409 --> 01:30:50.430]  No, I was just told, do it.
[01:30:50.529 --> 01:30:50.869]  I did it.
[01:30:51.090 --> 01:30:51.909]  And people go, that's crazy.
[01:30:51.989 --> 01:30:52.869]  You're saying God talks to you.
[01:30:52.989 --> 01:30:56.829]  Well, it happens all the time, and now God's telling me, when he tells me, I'll just start doing it on air.
[01:30:57.029 --> 01:30:57.970]  He tells me right now, I'll do it.
[01:30:58.050 --> 01:30:58.649]  It's never wrong.
[01:30:58.789 --> 01:30:59.430]  I know what it's God.
[01:30:59.449 --> 01:31:00.069]  I feel it.
[01:31:02.130 --> 01:31:04.329]  It's time for everything to come out, folks.
[01:31:04.689 --> 01:31:06.569]  It's time to stop playing the games.
[01:31:10.210 --> 01:31:12.029]  But I don't need God to tell me that about the salmon.
[01:31:12.130 --> 01:31:13.329]  He gave me a brain to research it myself.
[01:31:18.689 --> 01:31:28.729]  If you missed that, go back to Wednesday morning of Election Day, the 6th of November, and we put it on X. It got like 3 million views.
[01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:30.770]  And you go watch me.
[01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:42.130]  The camera didn't have a screen up.
[01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:44.609]  You can see the time of the time o'clock, but my watch was there.
[01:31:44.729 --> 01:31:45.989]  And it's on record streaming out.
[01:31:46.010 --> 01:31:47.189]  There was a time at...
[01:31:49.059 --> 01:31:49.899]  11.35.
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:53.720]  They zoom in on my watch so they can see it.
[01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:56.100]  You see the clip?
[01:31:56.279 --> 01:31:56.819]  I say that.
[01:31:57.039 --> 01:31:57.340]  Then boom.
[01:31:57.659 --> 01:32:00.039]  Hours later, 1.27.
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:04.279]  I say they'll come on the stage and start speaking before the minute ends.
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:09.460]  Three seconds before it goes to 1.28.
[01:32:10.399 --> 01:32:11.779]  He says, thank you.
[01:32:14.069 --> 01:32:15.390]  Now, do I do that other times?
[01:32:15.710 --> 01:32:16.630]  You ever see me do that before?
[01:32:16.789 --> 01:32:17.869]  No, just that one time.
[01:32:19.090 --> 01:32:22.489]  Oh, you can say, well, then we talked to Trump, and then Trump did it.
[01:32:23.210 --> 01:32:23.529]  No.
[01:32:24.890 --> 01:32:25.409]  That's God.
[01:32:28.069 --> 01:32:29.149]  It happens to me all the time.
[01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:30.470]  I just don't talk about it.
[01:32:32.029 --> 01:32:33.590]  God will say, okay, I'm going to show you this.
[01:32:34.289 --> 01:32:34.909]  I'm right here.
[01:32:34.989 --> 01:32:35.789]  I want you to listen to me.
[01:32:35.930 --> 01:32:37.369]  I'm going to show you something just with times.
[01:32:37.470 --> 01:32:38.130]  That's something you get.
[01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:40.430]  So when I tell you other stuff, do what I tell you.
[01:32:40.609 --> 01:32:43.229]  And I've just finally, at like 50, gotten where...
[01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:46.390]  When God tells me to do something, now I do it.
[01:32:49.909 --> 01:32:54.390]  I mean, if I felt it, it's not like an audible voice, but it's a voice.
[01:32:54.529 --> 01:32:55.850]  You feel the presence like on my back.
[01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:56.390]  It's like warm.
[01:32:56.569 --> 01:32:57.810]  It's like, ooh, something's there.
[01:32:58.649 --> 01:33:01.050]  And then I'm like, my brain goes bloop.
[01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:05.069]  And if I was sitting there and God went bloop, told me to jump off a cliff, I'd do it.
[01:33:06.010 --> 01:33:07.029]  Because it's never wrong.
[01:33:07.609 --> 01:33:08.470]  But I'm digressing.
[01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:12.810]  Let's go to break here.
[01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:17.859]  And then I'm going to come back very judiciously.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:18.579]  I think I did pretty good.
[01:33:18.699 --> 01:33:23.159]  I should have four and a half plus hours nonstop.
[01:33:24.859 --> 01:33:31.399]  And then I'm going to just plow through all of this other news and tell you what the globalists are up to and what they're planning.
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:36.060]  And obviously they're not planning on going quietly.
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:39.479]  But the good news is there is such an awakening.
[01:33:39.479 --> 01:33:42.359]  They're going to have big problems trying to pull off anything.
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:56.760]  As long as Trump doesn't put a bunch of bad people in his administration, doesn't just sit there and let him get him off balance and respond to their crap, and as long as we stay focused and aren't naive, we've got a really, really good chance to turn around society.
[01:33:57.279 --> 01:33:58.220]  So let me do this.
[01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:09.939]  If you go to thealexshonestore.com, There is a custom designer knife that I came up with.
[01:34:10.279 --> 01:34:19.020]  This is what I think is you really got to defend yourself in a serious situation, say like in your home or office or wherever, you know, even in your car, you got to check your local jurisdictions.
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:21.359]  It's legal to own in your home and have most areas.
[01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:22.779]  This may be, you know, you're going to check all that.
[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:24.880]  This is basically a short sword knife.
[01:34:25.929 --> 01:34:29.529]  It's a trench knife, World War I, World War II, Vietnam.
[01:34:29.850 --> 01:34:34.050]  It's got the brass knuckles, great grip, skull crusher, double-edged dagger.
[01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:35.869]  This is how you defend yourself.
[01:34:36.949 --> 01:34:39.609]  And I named it the 1776 Devastator.
[01:34:40.689 --> 01:34:43.149]  There were only 850 of them made.
[01:34:44.010 --> 01:34:47.649]  It's got my signature on one side, Betsy Ross flag, and 1776 on the other.
[01:34:47.869 --> 01:34:50.470]  When it sold out, it sold out.
[01:34:53.029 --> 01:34:56.170]  1776 Devastator, thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:34:56.289 --> 01:34:58.670]  Got a nice sheath scabbard.
[01:34:59.689 --> 01:35:03.510]  And then, this is DMO Knives, super custom knife.
[01:35:04.289 --> 01:35:08.250]  It's a breacher, highest quality steel, handmade.
[01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:11.590]  Made in Arkansas.
[01:35:12.189 --> 01:35:14.010]  They only made 550 of these.
[01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:15.310]  They're almost sold out right now.
[01:35:15.689 --> 01:35:20.210]  And that's at dmonives.com, dmonives.com.
[01:35:21.449 --> 01:35:23.050]  And they sell one knife at a time.
[01:35:23.670 --> 01:35:25.510]  And that's the knife they're available right now.
[01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:27.149]  DMONives.com.
[01:35:27.409 --> 01:35:28.210]  The Outback.
[01:35:28.789 --> 01:35:31.770]  The answer to 1984 is the name of the blade.
[01:35:32.670 --> 01:35:35.329]  And that is a fundraiser as well.
[01:35:35.829 --> 01:35:46.590]  But if you really want to make a donation, like I use the example of NPR gets hundreds of millions of taxpayer money, but they still do fundraisers constantly.
[01:35:47.710 --> 01:35:52.989]  And when you know when you get a t-shirt and you make a $100 donation, that the t-shirt costs them $10, $15.
[01:35:54.250 --> 01:35:58.710]  Or you know when you get a $50 donation, the coffee mug costs $5, $6, $7.
[01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:04.149]  But it's a memento that you help keep communism and evil on the air.
[01:36:04.569 --> 01:36:07.510]  Well, we need something where some real money comes in.
[01:36:07.569 --> 01:36:10.630]  Because like with the supplements and stuff, when it's discounted, we're barely making any money.
[01:36:10.770 --> 01:36:11.770]  And they're a great sponsor.
[01:36:11.850 --> 01:36:12.510]  That's their decision.
[01:36:12.729 --> 01:36:12.930]  Fine.
[01:36:12.949 --> 01:36:16.649]  A lot of money comes in, but not as big a profit as we need in case we get shut down.
[01:36:17.630 --> 01:36:20.689]  It's a really good chance next Wednesday, the moment of truth is here.
[01:36:21.670 --> 01:36:24.850]  Payroll, satellite, servers, legal, all of it.
[01:36:24.989 --> 01:36:27.050]  I mean, I don't want to skip a beat here.
[01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:29.329]  And right now, we're not in a great position.
[01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:31.989]  We got enough money to kind of operate on, but it's tenuous.
[01:36:32.609 --> 01:36:33.670]  We need your support.
[01:36:33.850 --> 01:36:35.590]  We're doing important work here.
[01:36:35.710 --> 01:36:36.909]  I want to thank you for your past support.
[01:36:37.289 --> 01:36:39.090]  You want to go to theauctionstore.com.
[01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:42.970]  And I had the idea, why don't we have some InfoWars posters?
[01:36:43.729 --> 01:36:46.449]  So if we don't get it shut down, you know you help save us.
[01:36:46.689 --> 01:36:51.069]  If it does get shut down, the bad guys are even claiming they own the name and all this.
[01:36:51.149 --> 01:36:54.130]  So these will be, and I still do, for another few days.
[01:36:55.170 --> 01:36:56.670]  We can put this poster out.
[01:36:56.750 --> 01:37:00.310]  I can license this poster that is a memento.
[01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:02.069]  So I designed those.
[01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:03.449]  It's just red on black.
[01:37:03.449 --> 01:37:04.250]  Looks amazing.
[01:37:04.890 --> 01:37:07.289]  Says the answer to 1984.
[01:37:09.710 --> 01:37:10.689]  1776 on one.
[01:37:11.899 --> 01:37:14.180]  One says 1776 worldwide, 2024.
[01:37:14.539 --> 01:37:15.460]  Alex Jones.
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:17.680]  Really good looking posters.
[01:37:18.279 --> 01:37:21.520]  The other one is InfoWars Lives Forever.
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:23.979]  White on black with my signature.
[01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:28.119]  And then there's the fun Star Wars limited edition one as well.
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:38.100]  And there's a limited amount of all of those, and we actually make some good money on that, but it's also a keepsake, and I think it'll be more valuable in the future regardless.
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:42.359]  This is a real piece of 1776, Second American Revolution, Part 2.
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:43.840]  They're all limited edition.
[01:37:43.939 --> 01:37:47.159]  There's a limited number of them that have been printed, and I ask you to go there now and get them.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.659]  Here's a closer look at them, and then I'll come back and hit all the rest of the news.
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:05.239]  We brought in a lot of money at the yellowshowstore.com to our sponsor.
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:06.460]  And they're great guys.
[01:38:06.619 --> 01:38:07.199]  They're great marketers.
[01:38:07.319 --> 01:38:07.720]  They're bigly.
[01:38:07.819 --> 01:38:12.239]  They produce the best Trump shirts and are big sponsors for Steven Crowder and the Hodge twins and so many others.
[01:38:13.119 --> 01:38:15.560]  I had little talks with them though because I see the numbers.
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:19.039]  I'm like, you're selling the CMOS for 55% off.
[01:38:19.699 --> 01:38:22.579]  And then you give VIP members another discount?
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:23.880]  And I go, let me see the numbers.
[01:38:24.039 --> 01:38:27.619]  Oh, actually, some of these deals we lose money, but we're getting new customers.
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:28.159]  They're going to love it.
[01:38:28.159 --> 01:38:38.149]  I'm like, Okay, let's have a couple fundraiser t-shirts that are 50 bucks so we actually get 20 something bucks after all the cost.
[01:38:38.630 --> 01:38:40.029]  And I'm not complaining, I'm just saying.
[01:38:40.210 --> 01:38:41.930]  So I had an idea two weeks ago.
[01:38:42.569 --> 01:38:44.229]  We'll do a wide shot so you can see these.
[01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:53.189]  And I said, okay, I want a red on black classic InfoWars that says 1776 worldwide, 2024, my signature.
[01:38:54.310 --> 01:39:01.430]  Historic, looks great in your office, great wherever, you know you support us, whatever happens to InfoWars that survives is even cooler, doesn't survive, you got the memento, it helps fund the future.
[01:39:02.449 --> 01:39:05.189]  An Alex Jones style Star Wars fun thing we came up with.
[01:39:05.409 --> 01:39:09.670]  And then the other thing I designed, white on black InfoWars lives forever with my signature.
[01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:10.909]  It's right there.
[01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:13.250]  There are only a few thousand of each one of these.
[01:39:13.350 --> 01:39:14.270]  They're limited edition.
[01:39:15.010 --> 01:39:17.970]  This is literally you knowing you back the second American Revolution.
[01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:19.010]  It's such a critical time.
[01:39:19.149 --> 01:39:22.510]  While we've gone over the top, while we have the initiative, while this is all happening.
[01:39:22.949 --> 01:39:26.470]  So these things cost like $5 to print because they are high quality.
[01:39:26.729 --> 01:39:28.149]  And they're on like a poster boards.
[01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.930]  They're thick.
[01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:29.409]  They're nice.
[01:39:29.569 --> 01:39:30.649]  It's a particularly good movie poster.
[01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:36.270]  And then the tube and all that's like six, seven bucks, eight bucks per unit.
[01:39:36.810 --> 01:39:45.170]  With 50 bucks, we're getting like, they get parved for other operations, but we're getting 20-something bucks for each poster for the operation.
[01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:51.989]  So if folks just go buy the posters, if people buy them right now, you'll hear me when I come back on Sunday and Monday.
[01:39:52.069 --> 01:39:53.770]  I won't be up here, please, please help me, help me, help me.
[01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:57.789]  If you go get those, we'll have the money and some runway out a few months.
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:00.340]  With illegal everything else.
[01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:05.500]  So if you want to keep the show on the air, this is the action point, thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:12.039]  And all the supplements are great, and all the t-shirts are great, and just, you know, everything's amazing.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:22.659]  It's just when they're selling a t-shirt for 25, 30 bucks, and the t-shirt costs $15, or if it's an XXXL, $17, and then they've got their expenses, and their crew, and the legal, and all this stuff, and then we blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:25.020]  Not a lot of money.
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:31.689]  So these are the things you get If you really want to support us, and all the Trump years in, it's amazing.
[01:40:31.829 --> 01:40:32.289]  Trump won.
[01:40:32.569 --> 01:40:34.029]  I think he's the best designs out there.
[01:40:34.109 --> 01:40:35.050]  I'm proud of these guys.
[01:40:35.250 --> 01:40:36.430]  I love the work they're doing.
[01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:39.020]  And it's all there.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:42.880]  So the AlexJonesStore.com, three limited edition posters.
[01:40:43.479 --> 01:40:45.260]  I designed the red one and the white one.
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:47.119]  I mean, I've literally made those.
[01:40:47.479 --> 01:40:48.640]  And they're simple.
[01:40:48.739 --> 01:40:50.119]  They're very strong, very clean.
[01:40:50.819 --> 01:40:52.779]  It's my original design for the InfoWars logo.
[01:40:53.199 --> 01:40:55.539]  And then the middle one, I said, why don't we have a Star Wars one?
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:02.079]  Kind of a fun thing, you know, for somebody like if you've got a little arcade in your house with video games or pool table or whatever.
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:07.960]  I used to have a bigger house, but I don't have a room for a pool table now, but if I did, I'd be hanging in my house.
[01:41:08.039 --> 01:41:08.439]  That's fun.
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:11.340]  And so it's all there.
[01:41:11.619 --> 01:41:12.579]  To me, it's a no-brainer.
[01:41:12.699 --> 01:41:14.840]  I want to thank you respectfully for everything you've done.
[01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:17.220]  I want to thank God for leading guiding directors.
[01:41:17.399 --> 01:41:23.199]  I want to thank the crew for putting up with me because They understand, but I've been a jerk lately, I'll admit it.
[01:41:23.279 --> 01:41:24.000]  I try to repent.
[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:26.439]  I try to not be so angry, but this is our whole future.
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:27.619]  If they get it, they're pissed off too.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:36.420]  They've been busting their ass, and I'd sure like to not just, whether we survive or have to set up a new operation, it'd be nice to give these guys a bonus and maybe a raise.
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:40.939]  They haven't had bonuses or raises in over two years, and they're a badass team, so I salute them.
[01:41:41.039 --> 01:41:48.600]  So for all of us here at the Infowars family, whatever happens, it's all in God's plan, but God works through you, so take action now and be part of the fundraiser.
[01:41:48.739 --> 01:41:49.840]  Get the posters now.
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:57.699]  Ma'am, would you like to get the full service lubrication?
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:09.300]  I'm now going to start talking about the circuit murder.
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:10.439]  Not your beautiful hair.
[01:42:10.739 --> 01:42:12.460]  Put me in a cab, this is the new Alexis Jones.
[01:42:12.899 --> 01:42:15.220]  I'm doing good, you're doing good.
[01:42:15.399 --> 01:42:17.439]  He's gonna kill me, put me in a cab.
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:19.520]  Trump's doing it.
[01:42:20.159 --> 01:42:25.880]  Trump's shaving my head, I'm giving up my beautiful hair, my beautiful.
[01:42:26.699 --> 01:42:28.159]  He's gonna kill me.
[01:42:29.159 --> 01:42:35.000]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:51.680]  Okay, so a couple minutes ago, I heard a bunch of scrambling around in the back, and Alex was behaving in disturbing ways.
[01:42:51.859 --> 01:42:53.920]  He's now entered the studio.
[01:42:53.939 --> 01:42:55.800]  He seems to have calmed down.
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:57.199]  Are you okay?
[01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:58.460]  No, I'm not okay, Owen.
[01:42:59.159 --> 01:43:07.260]  I began watching your show today, and I was seeing all the videos you were playing of people worried about being put in concentration camps.
[01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:08.439]  And they're shaving their heads.
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.100]  And they're shaving their heads and being mass murdered.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.279]  And I just realized it's true.
[01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:15.340]  Trump did say all Hispanics are criminals and evil.
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:19.159]  He did say all veterans are dumb and stupid.
[01:43:20.359 --> 01:43:21.439]  He does love Hitler.
[01:43:22.319 --> 01:43:24.239]  He did start the war with Russia.
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:26.359]  He did create the inflation.
[01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:30.659]  And I just can't live in this country anymore.
[01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:36.300]  And watching those people, they were so eloquent and didn't look totally insane or nuts.
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:40.279]  They convinced me that I am a trashy American.
[01:43:40.279 --> 01:43:41.340]  I am garbage.
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:43.680]  And that there aren't just two sexes.
[01:43:43.899 --> 01:43:45.340]  And men are the problem.
[01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:47.420]  Men are the problem on Earth.
[01:43:47.579 --> 01:43:53.439]  So we just got rid of men like BlackRock and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab that created all this to divide men and women from each other.
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:55.439]  And that's a good thing, by the way, that they're right.
[01:43:56.239 --> 01:44:04.050]  So in solidarity with the B4 movement, Out of South Korea where men are the problem and where women shave their heads and don't have sex.
[01:44:05.029 --> 01:44:06.890]  And that's going to fix the world.
[01:44:08.130 --> 01:44:15.050]  That I want to announce here on air that since Infowars next week is already getting sold off and shut down, I'm not coming back.
[01:44:15.369 --> 01:44:16.949]  I am retiring forever.
[01:44:18.369 --> 01:44:22.670]  Well, as Alex Jones, but I'm going to become Alexis Jones.
[01:44:23.170 --> 01:44:26.369]  And I am going to support depopulation.
[01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:31.460]  I am going to support You know, carbon taxes.
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:33.380]  I'm going to support atrazine in the water.
[01:44:34.359 --> 01:44:40.420]  And I'm going to be a good person now because I don't want to support the plan Trump's got to put everybody in concentration camps.
[01:44:40.659 --> 01:44:47.600]  And so even though I love my long, flowing, beautiful hair, like the B4 movement, just because of the Trump election, I'm joining them.
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:48.800]  I am a trashy American.
[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:52.600]  No one should go to the auctionstore.com and get this hat or this shirt.
[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:55.600]  To keep us on the air if we get shut down next week, don't do that.
[01:44:55.739 --> 01:45:03.720]  It's good the deep state, the CIA, and FBI are on record doing all the fake trials and putting you in prison and finding me guilty of stuff I didn't do and then a billion and a half dollar judgment.
[01:45:03.859 --> 01:45:08.539]  In fact, I think they were right when they asked for $2.76 trillion, the GDP of India.
[01:45:08.779 --> 01:45:10.300]  So I'm no longer Alex Jones now.
[01:45:11.439 --> 01:45:15.020]  I am now Alexis Jones.
[01:45:15.779 --> 01:45:17.500]  And in solidarity, I'm going to...
[01:45:18.119 --> 01:45:18.640]  Do this.
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:20.060]  I'm giving up a lot in my beautiful hair.
[01:45:20.939 --> 01:45:22.819]  I am, hold on, not yet.
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:23.880]  This is Mary.
[01:45:24.699 --> 01:45:29.420]  Her name used to be Martin, but she's the same as me now.
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:32.859]  He's become a she to get rid of their toxic masculinity.
[01:45:33.659 --> 01:45:35.800]  And so Mary's now a barber.
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:37.600]  I guess that's for men, a hairstylist.
[01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:41.239]  And so I'm now going to start talking about the secret murder.
[01:45:41.399 --> 01:45:42.319]  Not your beautiful hair.
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:43.159]  Put me in the cab.
[01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:44.340]  This is the new Alexis Jones.
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:45.439]  Oh, do it.
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:45.960]  Oh, God.
[01:45:46.119 --> 01:45:46.520]  You're doing good.
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:46:10.439]  Here's We're gonna put you in a Handmaid's Tale outfit.
[01:46:11.899 --> 01:46:13.300]  We're going to make a breeder out of you.
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:16.779]  Project 2025 is coming for you now.
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:17.899]  Don't grab my pussy!
[01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:18.960]  No, Alexis.
[01:46:19.439 --> 01:46:20.220]  We're going to get you too.
[01:46:20.539 --> 01:46:24.939]  You think just because- And if that bullet would have just been a little more off, we wouldn't be in this situation.
[01:46:25.279 --> 01:46:29.399]  You think just because you're going to shave your head doesn't mean we're not coming for you with Project 2025?
[01:46:29.479 --> 01:46:32.279]  I weigh 700 pounds and look like a mutant.
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:36.939]  Not because the chemicals in the water and the food.
[01:46:37.819 --> 01:46:38.319]  RFK Jr.
[01:46:38.439 --> 01:46:39.319]  is trying to stop it.
[01:46:39.420 --> 01:46:39.800]  He's back!
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:54.380]  I'm a woman!
[01:46:54.939 --> 01:46:57.119]  Don't you talk back when a woman's speaking!
[01:46:57.340 --> 01:47:06.600]  Any woman over 10% body fat, we're going to put you on Ozempic and force you to use a treadmill two hours a day that will be mandated fasting because you have to fit into your handmaid's tail outfit.
[01:47:07.699 --> 01:47:08.399]  I gave up my hair.
[01:47:08.399 --> 01:47:09.560]  You're now part of it, Alexis.
[01:47:09.899 --> 01:47:10.680]  You've done this to yourself.
[01:47:10.819 --> 01:47:13.140]  You could have been a man, but then you decided to be a woman.
[01:47:13.239 --> 01:47:15.100]  Now you will get the Handmaid's Tale treatment.
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:18.140]  In fact, I can't believe I've been wearing this shirt.
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:19.739]  You will be a breeder now.
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:21.439]  This should be outlawed as well.
[01:47:21.739 --> 01:47:22.880]  You will be a breeder now.
[01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:26.659]  Free the nipple, but you'll be in your handmaid's tail outfit soon.
[01:47:26.779 --> 01:47:29.319]  Just a couple months, Alexis.
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:30.319]  You did this to yourself.
[01:47:30.439 --> 01:47:32.479]  You could have been a man, but now you want to be a woman.
[01:47:32.739 --> 01:47:36.659]  So now you will be forced to breed when we tell you to?
[01:47:36.859 --> 01:47:37.420]  You will be forced...
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:38.680]  Now I'm a good person.
[01:47:39.140 --> 01:47:42.100]  Now we can have nuclear war like Sean Penn says with Russia.
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:45.380]  And the children should be given that routine.
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:52.300]  Donald Trump just ordered 150 million red capes for you to wear for your Handmaid's Tale future.
[01:47:52.539 --> 01:47:53.479]  Do you understand this?
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:54.399]  This is where you will go?
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:54.659]  Yes!
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:56.560]  That's why I'm moving to Australia.
[01:47:56.899 --> 01:47:58.140]  And it's definitely...
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:47:59.260]  My girlfriend, the one that...
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:02.039]  The one that looks like Jabba the Hutt's daughter on screen, please.
[01:48:02.279 --> 01:48:05.640]  And it's definitely not a joke when we say, your body, my choice.
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:06.699]  That is not a joke.
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:08.579]  I want to show the beautiful young lady you showed earlier.
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:09.479]  That was never humor.
[01:48:09.699 --> 01:48:12.100]  It's not the GMO and the Prozac she's on that makes her look like that.
[01:48:12.199 --> 01:48:13.279]  It's Trump's fault.
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:17.920]  That's why we need to follow what big pharma and mainstream media says.
[01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:19.800]  They care about us.
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:20.260]  Yes.
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:24.260]  You must be talking about your friend there on the screen.
[01:48:24.539 --> 01:48:24.779]  Yes.
[01:48:25.239 --> 01:48:28.220]  You know, that actually takes effort to look that good.
[01:48:29.069 --> 01:48:31.489]  Do you understand how much work that would take to look that good?
[01:48:32.689 --> 01:48:39.270]  For someone like that, we have to have an extra support Peloton bike.
[01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:41.409]  It has to be like steel reinforced.
[01:48:41.970 --> 01:48:47.829]  But she will be forced to exercise 10 hours a day until she can fit into her Handmaid's Tale outfit.
[01:48:49.829 --> 01:48:52.270]  All I know is that this is total insanity.
[01:48:52.489 --> 01:48:53.289]  I mean, they're in a cult.
[01:48:54.229 --> 01:49:00.109]  It's like the trans movement, which was set up by the MI6 on record to set up a sterilization program, make it cool.
[01:49:00.689 --> 01:49:03.729]  They tell them, oh, accept them and love them, they'll commit suicide.
[01:49:03.909 --> 01:49:06.930]  No, it's because of the hormones and the cult they're in, they're committing suicide.
[01:49:07.090 --> 01:49:20.590]  And then as they all get more and more desperate in the leftist cult, They then turn around to us because we haven't fully fallen to this globalist system that they admit is a system to sabotage civilization, the Great Reset.
[01:49:20.789 --> 01:49:26.560]  They literally think those of us trying to stop Our collective destruction are the bad ones.
[01:49:26.619 --> 01:49:29.119]  They think once we're gone, then she's going to be okay.
[01:49:29.279 --> 01:49:33.619]  No, lady, obviously your upbringing, what you're around, what you're doing, that's the problem.
[01:49:33.779 --> 01:49:35.359]  Not Trump, not me, not Owen.
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:42.699]  Well, what's so crazy when we look at these videos, there's very few of them where the women even look like passable, right?
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:46.159]  I mean, some of these women, you're like, oh, okay, you're not too bad looking.
[01:49:46.539 --> 01:49:48.939]  But it's like half of these characters, like, look at this.
[01:49:49.239 --> 01:49:53.380]  Half of these characters that show up in these videos, they look like they're just gone.
[01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:55.789]  They're already gone.
[01:49:57.500 --> 01:49:59.800]  Well, I mean, look, this is brainwashing.
[01:50:00.420 --> 01:50:01.380]  This is the chemicals.
[01:50:01.659 --> 01:50:02.260]  It's happened to everybody.
[01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:04.439]  Look, the sperm count's down over 90% in the United States.
[01:50:04.979 --> 01:50:06.039]  Like Kennedy says, we're the sickest.
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:06.779]  Our kids are dying.
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:07.579]  We don't live as long.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.399]  I mean, we're being killed.
[01:50:09.579 --> 01:50:11.399]  So we're all been, I mean, you're in great shape.
[01:50:11.539 --> 01:50:12.199]  You have great genetics.
[01:50:12.699 --> 01:50:17.560]  But you're not what you would have been if you weren't raised in all of this.
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:23.420]  And, you know, if everybody looks like that all of a sudden, and we're all falling apart, we might want to understand this is by design.
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:24.579]  Well, that's how you get conquered.
[01:50:25.329 --> 01:50:26.289]  Well, you know, and that's the funny thing.
[01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:35.689]  You know, the WALL-E, when you watch WALL-E, it's like they turn humanity into basically just this worthless mass that just gets shuffled around all day.
[01:50:35.770 --> 01:50:38.670]  And, of course, that's all run by AI, and then the AI program takes over.
[01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:44.810]  But it's like it's not – they'll use AI, but it's like there's the bureaucratic management class.
[01:50:44.970 --> 01:50:46.350]  They want you like that.
[01:50:46.510 --> 01:50:47.710]  They want you worthless.
[01:50:47.850 --> 01:50:51.310]  They want you – They don't even want you to be able to shit on your own toilet.
[01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:56.229]  They want to have a robot come wipe your ass because you're literally that gone.
[01:50:56.310 --> 01:50:58.590]  It's like having a respirator instead of breathing.
[01:50:58.789 --> 01:51:00.029]  You think, oh, I have a respirator.
[01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:00.850]  I don't have to breathe.
[01:51:01.909 --> 01:51:12.050]  That's how they controlled several of the dynasties of the Chinese thousands of years ago, is they would tell the women to control the queens and their daughters, we bind your feet because royalty doesn't walk, it has to be carried.
[01:51:12.189 --> 01:51:15.229]  And you can't feed yourself, you have like foot-long fingernails.
[01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:18.810]  And so they made them these totally like babies, they controlled with that.
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:24.779]  And so this is, and yeah, in Wall-E, whoever wrote that, they're telling you actually what the plan is.
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:27.960]  You read the globalist documents like why the future doesn't need us to build joy in 1999.
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:30.159]  And he said, I went to a big globalist conference.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:35.340]  Do we get people to play video games and just be fat and take drugs?
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:37.279]  Or do we just go ahead and wipe everybody out?
[01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:38.699]  And we're like, we'll just go ahead and wipe everybody out.
[01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:40.199]  So that decision's been made.
[01:51:40.279 --> 01:51:41.159]  This is a real project.
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:42.720]  And it sounds horrible.
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:43.579]  People don't want to admit it.
[01:51:43.659 --> 01:51:50.399]  But the general public that's smart enough is actually reading it, seeing the globalists, watching Davos Group events, listening to Elon Musk.
[01:51:50.439 --> 01:51:52.600]  And we're saying we're not part of the death cult.
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:53.399]  We're team humanity.
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:54.840]  So we've got tomorrow.
[01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:55.640]  I'm coming in Saturday.
[01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:56.239]  We've got Sunday.
[01:51:56.239 --> 01:51:56.680]  I'm here.
[01:51:56.899 --> 01:51:57.859]  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[01:51:58.020 --> 01:51:59.020]  You bad guys buy it Wednesday.
[01:51:59.819 --> 01:52:02.039]  As part of the sale, they want to shut down the next day.
[01:52:02.199 --> 01:52:03.640]  I don't know what's going to happen to this auction.
[01:52:04.119 --> 01:52:06.359]  But it's just an amazing time to be alive, Owen.
[01:52:07.130 --> 01:52:10.789]  Well, and you know, what's also amazing is that we got to see this election through.
[01:52:11.329 --> 01:52:15.590]  And we got to be here with the great audience and the great crew for that victory.
[01:52:16.869 --> 01:52:18.569]  It just felt written in the stars.
[01:52:18.810 --> 01:52:20.569]  Well, they tried hard to get us out before then.
[01:52:21.369 --> 01:52:23.529]  I remember 14 weeks ago when the...
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:31.760]  Federal trustee, because the Justice Department came in, they're going to have a trustee appointed, came and ordered this place shut with no court order, and people didn't believe us, and it was in the paper a few days later.
[01:52:32.199 --> 01:52:36.760]  I mean, people don't come and shut down businesses without court orders, and that's the left.
[01:52:36.939 --> 01:52:38.159]  That's their vigilantism.
[01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:42.920]  Well, until they've dealt with the people we've had to deal with, it's almost, you almost can't even fathom.
[01:52:43.479 --> 01:52:46.619]  The lack of integrity and ethics and morals.
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:53:06.539]  I mean, they really- And he worked here six years.
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:08.380]  Been on the air as an anchor for years.
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:09.359]  I mean, it's...
[01:53:09.359 --> 01:53:10.680]  I mean, folks...
[01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:11.819]  But imagine, think about the future.
[01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:13.600]  But just think about the...
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:14.819]  That's perjury.
[01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:16.420]  If you did that, you'd get six years in prison.
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:18.840]  But think about the future, Alex, where...
[01:53:19.470 --> 01:53:21.909]  Let's say there is a journalist out there.
[01:53:22.029 --> 01:53:24.750]  Let's say it's a Glenn Greenwald, a Tucker Carlson, whatever.
[01:53:25.170 --> 01:53:26.170]  World-renowned journalist.
[01:53:26.350 --> 01:53:29.069]  And then they just say, well, we're going to give him the Alex Jones treatment.
[01:53:29.170 --> 01:53:30.550]  We're going to wipe him off the internet.
[01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:32.069]  We're going to erase all of his stuff.
[01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:33.149]  And then they go to a quorum.
[01:53:33.289 --> 01:53:34.810]  There's no evidence this man is a journalist.
[01:53:34.909 --> 01:53:36.170]  It's like, well, you just erased me.
[01:53:36.989 --> 01:53:37.930]  It's like, that's what they're doing.
[01:53:38.050 --> 01:53:40.989]  It's like, oh, we just erased you, and then they're going to come in in your case.
[01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:42.789]  Oh, now they filed, as you know, to take my name.
[01:53:42.789 --> 01:53:43.270]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:53:43.350 --> 01:53:47.789]  Now they're going to say, oh, no, no, no, we own your, we own the likes of Alex Jones now.
[01:53:48.210 --> 01:53:57.750]  And people, when I first reported, it was in the filings months ago, they didn't believe it until the AP and Reuters headlines are, Sandy Goodfamilies acts for real Alex Jones and his name, Alex Jones.
[01:53:58.189 --> 01:53:59.810]  And they're like, you can't use your name.
[01:53:59.810 --> 01:54:00.489]  We own that.
[01:54:00.850 --> 01:54:02.130]  That doesn't happen in a bankruptcy.
[01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:03.550]  That violates the 13th Amendment.
[01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:05.010]  Against slavery.
[01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:06.510]  And they've had to back off.
[01:54:06.609 --> 01:54:07.569]  They go, we'll fall later.
[01:54:07.869 --> 01:54:09.149]  That's why we need support.
[01:54:09.529 --> 01:54:10.630]  And this is a war, folks.
[01:54:10.710 --> 01:54:12.289]  You want people to fight for it, you gotta back them.
[01:54:12.850 --> 01:54:14.050]  Hey, love you, Owen.
[01:54:14.130 --> 01:54:14.869]  Great job with the crew.
[01:54:14.989 --> 01:54:15.989]  I'm gonna let you finish up here.
[01:54:16.270 --> 01:54:23.250]  But I thought I would, it would have been funnier if I just cut to a video of me with a barber and I don't have hair, so I'm not making a sacrifice.
[01:54:25.050 --> 01:54:26.090]  We can go get a wig.
[01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:27.350]  I know there's a wig around here.
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:31.600]  I think there's a blue wig over on the other side, guys.
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:34.060]  If you walk towards my office, I believe there's a blue wig.
[01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:34.500]  All right, guys.
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:51.819]  I wanted to air that from last night on Owen's show, right at the end of the show, just to point out how sick the B4 movement is, where they've got the left having all these abortions, the left taking poison shots, the left saying they don't have babies, and then these women say, we're going to shave our heads because we're all being put in camps,
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:52.960]  and we're not going to have sex with men.
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:54.920]  They're extincting themselves.
[01:54:56.220 --> 01:54:58.640]  And they've already taken themselves out of the gene pool.
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:00.140]  Believe me, nobody wants to have sex with those women.
[01:55:00.359 --> 01:55:01.800]  I can show you a video of them.
[01:55:02.199 --> 01:55:05.119]  But they are totally locked in the cult.
[01:55:05.279 --> 01:55:09.399]  They can't admit that they're being brainwashed or been brainwashed.
[01:55:09.659 --> 01:55:10.739]  And it's very, very sad.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.899]  Okay, let me shift into all the news now.
[01:55:13.119 --> 01:55:14.000]  And there's a lot of it.
[01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:18.800]  If you just tuned in on the live streams at Rolex Jones, and there's I just checked.
[01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:20.000]  Even for Saturday, it's good.
[01:55:20.039 --> 01:55:23.100]  It'll probably be a couple million tonight, but it's about on the three streams together.
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:25.399]  Not about 600,000 people watching.
[01:55:25.979 --> 01:55:27.600]  And I just want to thank you all for doing that.
[01:55:27.659 --> 01:55:32.180]  And I want you to just all take the live feed again and retweet it and say, hey, Alex Jones is covering really important stuff.
[01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:36.260]  And then as soon as this live feed is done, I think I'm going to stop at about 25 minutes.
[01:55:37.579 --> 01:55:38.359]  Go see the family.
[01:55:38.779 --> 01:55:40.439]  Let the crew have a little bit of a break till tomorrow.
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:43.560]  We'll be here tomorrow live 4 to 8 p.m.
[01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:45.239]  Right until Wednesday.
[01:55:45.399 --> 01:55:46.420]  Now they sell it to bad guys.
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:48.979]  They said they're going to just turn the lights out as soon as it's sold.
[01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:53.399]  We're going to just stay on air Wednesday night or whenever it happens.
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:55.619]  When we get the word, we're going to stay here to the last minute.
[01:55:55.819 --> 01:55:56.180]  Bye-bye!
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:59.119]  We're just never giving up, fighting the last minute.
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:08.250]  And then you can find me at Real Alex Jones and AlexJones.network and AlexJones.live and RealAlexJones.com.
[01:56:08.630 --> 01:56:11.329]  Those are all sites that are going to be news sites that are being built.
[01:56:11.489 --> 01:56:13.470]  We've already got stuff on them, but there'll be a lot more there.
[01:56:14.750 --> 01:56:24.170]  We're busy little beavers while fighting the election, doing all the broadcasting, and going through all the globalist lawfare and building the whole new infrastructure with great folks we're working with and our sponsors at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:56:24.850 --> 01:56:28.430]  So get that great Rebellion of Tyrants as Obedience to God Punisher shirt.
[01:56:28.729 --> 01:56:33.189]  That is the second bestseller at TheAlexShowStore.com because we need the money.
[01:56:33.310 --> 01:56:34.149]  Plus, they're great shirts.
[01:56:34.609 --> 01:56:35.810]  It's quite the adventure to wear them.
[01:56:36.489 --> 01:56:44.329]  All right, so I've talked about what Trump should do and how Trump should behave and how we should behave and not be intimidated by the media and not be told how to act and not be politically correct.
[01:56:44.590 --> 01:56:46.670]  Everybody already knows that, but that means going all the way.
[01:56:47.699 --> 01:56:52.579]  And a great sign of that would be making me the White House Press Secretary, which I do not want to live in D.C. more than a couple weeks.
[01:56:53.439 --> 01:56:54.560]  I would go visit.
[01:56:55.119 --> 01:57:00.500]  I think they should rotate through people just to laugh and get in the face and destroy the corporate media.
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:04.680]  Further, it's the ultimate troll, and it just shows them they don't control or dictate what we do.
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:07.819]  We do the opposite of what they say and what they want us to do.
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:11.539]  Now that said, it trended the top of X. Elon Musk has responded.
[01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:14.800]  CNN and others are all reporting.
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:20.239]  The Pentagon's been having secret meetings about how they're not going to follow orders of Trump.
[01:57:20.539 --> 01:57:28.380]  And now remember, Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, famously called the Communist Chinese and said, don't worry, Trump doesn't have the nuke codes.
[01:57:28.479 --> 01:57:29.279]  He's not in command.
[01:57:29.579 --> 01:57:36.659]  Which is a military coup in waiting and administratively and diplomatically is a coup.
[01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:40.369]  Over the presidency and over the people.
[01:57:40.670 --> 01:57:55.909]  And now you've got bills introduced by Senator Blumenthal, a bill that during insurrection, during uprisings, they promised they're going to have, if he gets into August, all the different Democrats have been saying it, as you know, that they have a bill to strip the president of domestic use of military.
[01:57:56.890 --> 01:57:59.130]  So they're planning to stir something up where that would be needed.
[01:58:00.449 --> 01:58:04.590]  And that would be a legislative coup over the executive there as well and over the people.
[01:58:05.569 --> 01:58:05.970]  So...
[01:58:07.229 --> 01:58:12.109]  The unelected bureaucracy of this government answers to the civilian and newly elected leadership.
[01:58:12.869 --> 01:58:16.869]  Elon Musk joined Trump for a call with Zelensky.
[01:58:36.519 --> 01:58:41.939]  I hope Trump fires them all.
[01:58:42.119 --> 01:58:42.319]  Yeah.
[01:58:43.579 --> 01:58:45.159]  I remember what Hillary said a few months ago.
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:47.739]  I'm not going to bore you with the clip if you want to find it.
[01:58:47.819 --> 01:58:48.600]  It's on In Wokeness.
[01:58:48.699 --> 01:58:49.720]  I've already played this like 10 times.
[01:58:50.359 --> 01:58:56.539]  I don't know if we really understood how important Elon Musk is to free speech, said Chad Johnson.
[01:58:56.939 --> 01:59:02.300]  In Wokeness, Hillary Clinton, we lose control if social media stops censoring content.
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:03.600]  Turns out she was right.
[01:59:05.359 --> 01:59:07.859]  So, they're out in the open.
[01:59:08.039 --> 01:59:10.819]  And Yvaldo Harari said that two days before Trump got elected...
[01:59:11.890 --> 01:59:13.949]  He said, our world government is over.
[01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:16.890]  No one will pledge allegiance to the world government if Trump gets elected.
[01:59:18.569 --> 01:59:20.949]  And the New Yorker said, oh, we talked to top TV executives.
[01:59:21.170 --> 01:59:22.250]  Everybody already hates them.
[01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.989]  They have no ratings.
[01:59:23.489 --> 01:59:26.850]  They'll be dead if they can't convince people to vote against Trump.
[01:59:27.310 --> 01:59:28.829]  Dead as in dead politically.
[01:59:29.149 --> 01:59:32.930]  As in, oh, that town's dead or that restaurant's dead or that place is dead this time of night.
[01:59:33.010 --> 01:59:33.850]  Not like we're going to kill them.
[01:59:35.409 --> 01:59:37.970]  So, just insane.
[01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:39.529]  Absolutely crazy.
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:47.560]  And then you've got the clip I already played that went viral of Pompeo when Trump got raided last year at Mar-a-Lago.
[01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:49.560]  Yeah, he looks pretty criminal.
[01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:50.180]  He's a criminal.
[01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:51.100]  He'll do some prison.
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:52.920]  Trump hadn't seen that.
[01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:53.659]  Now he has seen that.
[01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:55.479]  You're not getting the cabinet Pompeo.
[01:59:56.119 --> 02:00:02.279]  And Bill Gates is scurried back after being caught working with Kamala Harris behind the scenes giving him at least $50 million, saying he wants to be friends with Donald Trump.
[02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:03.739]  Well, nobody wants to be friends with you.
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:04.640]  Your wife left you.
[02:00:04.779 --> 02:00:07.619]  You've got criminal charges against you in the Netherlands, in India.
[02:00:08.340 --> 02:00:09.079]  No, sir.
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.119]  So here's that CNN clip I just mentioned.
[02:00:12.399 --> 02:00:12.699]  Clip 10.
[02:00:14.010 --> 02:00:17.210]  On discussions at the Pentagon, I don't know at what level this is.
[02:00:17.310 --> 02:00:19.229]  It just seems like it's informal discussions.
[02:00:19.649 --> 02:00:22.390]  I guess it's understandable they would have those discussions.
[02:00:22.689 --> 02:00:25.529]  It also, I mean, Scott, is it?
[02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:29.149]  Look, I don't like this because what's Donald Trump supposed to think?
[02:00:29.369 --> 02:00:41.909]  You know, he's sitting down there, he's the president-elect, and now he's got to read the newspaper tonight that the unelected bureaucracy of the federal government is having meetings at some level about how to thwart or countermand The commander-in-chief.
[02:00:41.930 --> 02:00:45.510]  I don't care if it's at the Pentagon or at the HUD or Ag Department.
[02:00:45.689 --> 02:00:46.369]  It doesn't matter.
[02:00:46.630 --> 02:00:53.390]  The unelected bureaucracy of this government answers to the civilian and duly elected leadership that we just did.
[02:00:53.550 --> 02:01:05.369]  And if you were in his shoes and you just won the popular vote with a clear mandate and now you've got to read that these unelected bureaucrats are plotting against you, what would you think?
[02:01:05.489 --> 02:01:06.989]  But I think there's a reason for that, though.
[02:01:06.989 --> 02:01:07.409]  Let me finish.
[02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:11.100]  If they have problems, they should not have meetings that then leak to the press.
[02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:19.119]  If they have ideas or things, they should call the president's office and say, hey, we'd like to have some discussions for planning purposes.
[02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:20.920]  But secret meetings that leak?
[02:01:21.319 --> 02:01:23.500]  Terrible way to get off to a start with the new administration.
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:25.939]  Well, I agree that that's maybe not the best way to do it.
[02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:30.960]  However, Trump has set them up to be in this situation where they think that he's coming after them.
[02:01:32.189 --> 02:01:37.369]  Top General Milley reassured China others in secret calls as Trump pushed election lies.
[02:01:37.630 --> 02:01:38.350]  Oh, yeah.
[02:01:38.489 --> 02:01:39.130]  Said, don't worry.
[02:01:39.329 --> 02:01:40.069]  I'm in control.
[02:01:40.189 --> 02:01:40.850]  He's not the president.
[02:01:41.069 --> 02:01:42.029]  Wow, that's a coup.
[02:01:43.810 --> 02:01:44.170]  Yeah.
[02:01:44.710 --> 02:01:47.409]  And member Milley this year, oh, God, he's going to put me in prison.
[02:01:47.569 --> 02:01:49.850]  Well, Milley should be charged for espionage.
[02:01:51.130 --> 02:01:53.670]  Mark Milley fears being court-martialed if Trump wins.
[02:01:55.909 --> 02:01:57.470]  Great job, crew, finding that so fast.
[02:01:57.550 --> 02:01:58.829]  They just type in whatever I say and pull it up.
[02:01:58.850 --> 02:01:59.970]  I don't want you to think I'm making this up.
[02:02:01.449 --> 02:02:02.710]  Alright, so there's that.
[02:02:03.130 --> 02:02:04.930]  Oh my God, he wants to fire people.
[02:02:04.989 --> 02:02:05.970]  We're not going to put up with that.
[02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:08.710]  Absolutely insane.
[02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:27.409]  By the way, you know federal judges in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, and others have been ordering all of this discovery of the millions of illegals and others on the voting rolls and all the rest of it released.
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:36.720]  And in these lawsuits that took years to get the information proving 2020 was stolen, another reason the deep state's so scared, this came out.
[02:02:36.859 --> 02:02:49.600]  Breaking Maricopa County recorder, that's over the elections, Stephanie Richards' deposition transcript shows desire to make life hell for Carrie Lake, calls himself anti-MAGA in text messages.
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:53.000]  Now he's counting the votes in Lake's Senate race where she said...
[02:02:54.039 --> 02:02:57.600]  They've been suppressing Republican votes and not letting them go to the machines, piling them up.
[02:02:57.779 --> 02:02:59.399]  And sure enough, now they're getting into all the ballots.
[02:02:59.539 --> 02:03:00.819]  They're finding out they're legitimate ballots.
[02:03:01.899 --> 02:03:03.020]  At least I checked yesterday.
[02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:04.819]  Guys, look at the counting on the lake race.
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:10.319]  But all those ballots, most of those ballots were for her and for Trump.
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:11.619]  And now she's boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:13.720]  At least last night has a chance.
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:14.899]  Maybe it's already been called.
[02:03:15.039 --> 02:03:15.260]  I don't know.
[02:03:15.279 --> 02:03:17.119]  Can we look up the current lake race?
[02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:19.720]  Just type in current numbers, lake race, Arizona.
[02:03:20.449 --> 02:03:22.390]  All right, because I don't know the latest on that.
[02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:24.449]  I don't want to steer you wrong, but we hope for her.
[02:03:24.890 --> 02:03:25.470]  But she was right.
[02:03:25.670 --> 02:03:28.630]  She goes, you watch when you get all those ballots that they were like, oh, there's a problem.
[02:03:28.729 --> 02:03:29.470]  Or, oh, the machines are broke.
[02:03:29.550 --> 02:03:30.149]  Just leave them here.
[02:03:34.449 --> 02:03:37.109]  Yeah, she's been steadily gaining as more come in.
[02:03:37.989 --> 02:03:39.489]  And that's with 83% in.
[02:03:39.529 --> 02:03:41.350]  So she's got a good chance at winning if you look at the trend.
[02:03:42.510 --> 02:03:43.449]  So there you go.
[02:03:44.790 --> 02:03:45.750]  How surprising.
[02:03:45.989 --> 02:03:47.329]  You know, I'm not surprised at all.
[02:03:48.050 --> 02:03:55.369]  On Tuesday morning, I posted this, and I said, this image is my prediction for the election.
[02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:59.789]  They won't have enough fraud baked in to get above the landslide.
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:02.000]  And that is the image.
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:04.239]  We've got to make a t-shirt of that or a poster.
[02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:07.319]  That is the image that defines the whole thing.
[02:04:07.380 --> 02:04:14.659]  If you'll understand transgenderism and the big corporations that are behind it for sterilization, depopulation, they can make millions off each person they put in the cult right here.
[02:04:14.739 --> 02:04:17.199]  This is understanding, gender-affirming care.
[02:04:18.420 --> 02:04:27.399]  And for radio listeners, it's a jeweler looking at a giant stack of $100 bills with an optical monocle.
[02:04:28.369 --> 02:04:30.109]  It's all about the Benjamins.
[02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:33.170]  For the people that go along with it, for the higher-ups, it's about depopulation.
[02:04:34.829 --> 02:04:36.829]  And breaking up the family.
[02:04:38.689 --> 02:04:49.890]  Continuing, I'm going to do a big thing on this, probably tomorrow, because there's a bunch of video clips and stuff in this article from the internet with professors and leftist talk show hosts and others.
[02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:51.560]  Going, it's horrible.
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:53.939]  Don't let Trump and Robert McKinney Jr.
[02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:59.300]  take hydrofluosilic acid or super concentrated poison sodium fluoride out of the water.
[02:04:59.659 --> 02:05:00.539]  It's horrible.
[02:05:00.819 --> 02:05:06.180]  Even though the FDA now, oh, it lowers IQ, gives you cancer, destroys your teeth, gives you bone cancer, dental fluorosis.
[02:05:06.359 --> 02:05:06.939]  Totally horrible.
[02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:07.640]  Never should have been there.
[02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:08.340]  We always knew that.
[02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:08.979]  It's all confirmed.
[02:05:09.359 --> 02:05:10.739]  They knew back in the 40s they did it.
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:12.960]  Lowers fertility, gives you cancer, dumbs you down.
[02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:18.399]  And the leftists are defending the fluoride in the water.
[02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:27.119]  Also continuing here on this Saturday afternoon emergency transmission, avoid homes advertising Trump breaking.
[02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:33.720]  Whistleblower says FEMA ordered workers to purposely skip homes displaying pro-Trump signs in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton.
[02:05:33.899 --> 02:05:38.819]  That broke yesterday afternoon, and look, the director of the operations has resigned.
[02:05:39.060 --> 02:05:43.520]  The federal government has weaponized against the American people and needs to be purged.
[02:05:45.979 --> 02:05:47.079]  of globalist collaborators.
[02:05:47.439 --> 02:05:56.439]  Justin, FEMA supervisor who instructed disaster relief officials to avoid homes and not help Americans who showed support for Trump, has been relieved of duties according to official statement.
[02:05:57.320 --> 02:05:58.199]  Avoid homes.
[02:05:58.460 --> 02:06:00.180]  Advertising Trump, the FEMA supervisor wrote.
[02:06:00.659 --> 02:06:07.640]  Well, hell, we had the FEMA head people saying, we used to be egalitarian and just be fair, but we're not fair anymore.
[02:06:08.260 --> 02:06:14.819]  We only help LGBTQ. By the way, if you're a new viewer, I played the clip probably four or five times.
[02:06:14.819 --> 02:06:15.699]  You can never play it enough.
[02:06:16.789 --> 02:06:17.329]  You know what?
[02:06:17.449 --> 02:06:18.090]  Find it, crew.
[02:06:18.289 --> 02:06:18.850]  You're awesome.
[02:06:19.850 --> 02:06:20.989]  We had articles about it.
[02:06:21.050 --> 02:06:23.289]  We got big coverage, but some people probably just didn't believe us.
[02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:25.170]  Some, unlike mainstream media, I'll actually show you when I say something.
[02:06:25.670 --> 02:06:34.130]  The headline was, FEMA says direct aid to LGBTQ. And it's worse.
[02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:36.010]  They say, we used to be egalitarian.
[02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:37.689]  We used to help everybody, but now we don't do that.
[02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:40.670]  Imagine the power of the government when it can discriminate.
[02:06:42.350 --> 02:06:43.350]  And that's what they're already doing.
[02:06:43.489 --> 02:06:44.670]  That's what the social credit score is.
[02:06:44.770 --> 02:06:45.609]  That's what globalism is.
[02:06:45.729 --> 02:06:53.229]  But then it gets down to, oh, don't help Trump supporters who are starving and dying, and people did die, and people that are stranded.
[02:06:53.489 --> 02:06:54.470]  Don't help them.
[02:06:54.609 --> 02:06:59.170]  And remember, we all said they're not giving aid in Trump areas, to the conservative counties, that they know are going to vote for Trump.
[02:06:59.289 --> 02:07:00.229]  It's election meddling.
[02:07:00.369 --> 02:07:04.529]  And now we have the director statewide saying, don't help Trump people.
[02:07:04.829 --> 02:07:06.029]  Here's the damn documents.
[02:07:07.029 --> 02:07:08.130]  Right here, it's in the tweet.
[02:07:08.489 --> 02:07:09.149]  Images of it.
[02:07:09.229 --> 02:07:10.270]  It's now admitted.
[02:07:12.130 --> 02:07:13.989]  Imagine the arrogance of these people.
[02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:15.270]  Imagine the craziness.
[02:07:15.449 --> 02:07:17.550]  But there, there, the proof, the proof, the proof.
[02:07:18.449 --> 02:07:21.489]  Yeah, folks that bombed with fluoride to sterilize you and make you dumb.
[02:07:21.890 --> 02:07:23.630]  Think they might be attacking some people?
[02:07:26.729 --> 02:07:29.689]  Absolutely insane in your face.
[02:07:30.590 --> 02:07:31.890]  See if you can find that FEMA thing.
[02:07:32.029 --> 02:07:32.390]  Let me know.
[02:07:33.010 --> 02:07:34.810]  It's like a 10-minute version, a two-minute version.
[02:07:34.989 --> 02:07:35.829]  You got it.
[02:07:35.970 --> 02:07:36.689]  We got it.
[02:07:36.909 --> 02:07:37.630]  We got it.
[02:07:38.029 --> 02:07:40.130]  These are senior FEMA administrators.
[02:07:41.810 --> 02:07:43.029]  That are so cultic.
[02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:47.810]  Imagine saying, we used to help everybody and be egalitarian, but not anymore.
[02:07:48.090 --> 02:07:49.829]  We've got people that are gay.
[02:07:50.109 --> 02:07:52.729]  They're already under attack.
[02:07:54.109 --> 02:07:55.109]  And then you get the memo.
[02:07:55.590 --> 02:07:58.289]  Don't help the old lady that's got a Trump sign.
[02:08:00.729 --> 02:08:03.670]  Imagine once they have the Social Credit Score totally in place, what that would be like.
[02:08:05.409 --> 02:08:06.149]  Here's the clip.
[02:08:07.399 --> 02:08:20.810]  It sparked a few things in my mind, thinking about preparedness and how you said, you know, LGBTQIA people and people who have been disadvantaged already are struggling.
[02:08:20.989 --> 02:08:24.369]  They already have their own things to deal with.
[02:08:24.529 --> 02:08:31.029]  So you add a disaster on top of that, it's just compounding on itself.
[02:08:32.029 --> 02:08:39.609]  And I think that is maybe the why of why we're having these discussions is because it isn't being talked about.
[02:08:39.770 --> 02:08:41.229]  It isn't being socialized.
[02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:44.090]  We're not paying attention to this community.
[02:08:44.710 --> 02:08:46.130]  Thank you so much.
[02:08:46.289 --> 02:08:48.079]  Maggie, Thank you.
[02:08:49.119 --> 02:08:51.979]  There are a couple of things that are intersecting in my mind here.
[02:08:52.140 --> 02:08:59.779]  One of them is the culture of emergency management as an organization, as an industry in the United States specifically, not abroad.
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:07.159]  This has, and my cat sometimes does this, she gets really loud suddenly, so you'll have to just allow for the little meowing in the background.
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:20.979]  The shift that we're seeing right now is a shift in emergency management from utilitarian principles where everything is designed for the greatest good, for the greatest amount of people, to disaster equity.
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:24.079]  But we have to do more, right?
[02:09:24.239 --> 02:09:44.529]  And so this topic is intersecting, I think, with a number of other topics where we have to look at policies And understand to what extent they have disadvantaged communities that had less assets, communities that had pre-existing vulnerabilities in accessing disaster-related recovery supports.
[02:09:45.989 --> 02:09:46.750]  There you go.
[02:09:46.810 --> 02:09:47.609]  I just want to show you this.
[02:09:47.710 --> 02:09:54.010]  Now, when I mentioned the Pentagon and how they're working with their own coup against America, I forgot to get to this clip.
[02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:59.770]  This is Rachel Maddow two nights ago.
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:07.279]  Saying, well I'll show you the clip, with a short clip out of context, Trump says he doesn't need votes.
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:10.699]  And everywhere else the left's saying this means he stole the election.
[02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:13.260]  No, he says this speech all the time.
[02:10:13.260 --> 02:10:14.880]  It's how Trump talks, it's how I talk.
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:18.979]  He says, I don't need votes.
[02:10:19.380 --> 02:10:20.979]  We already won in the past.
[02:10:21.119 --> 02:10:23.479]  We need to get our votes counted and stop the fraudulent ones.
[02:10:23.819 --> 02:10:25.000]  Which has now been proven.
[02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:30.229]  So they're using this as, quote, proof that he stole the election.
[02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:35.810]  Now they've got actors and people, I'll show you a clip in a minute, running around saying the most ridiculous crap you've ever heard.
[02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:45.869]  So here she is saying this, and then I'm going to play the clip of what Trump actually had to say in context, and you'll see what a big fat liar she is.
[02:10:45.970 --> 02:10:46.729]  But again, you already knew that.
[02:10:46.789 --> 02:10:47.090]  Here it is.
[02:10:48.689 --> 02:10:52.430]  But let me also point out something more strange, which...
[02:10:53.489 --> 02:10:56.170]  Has been happening at the same time and hasn't had as much attention.
[02:10:57.470 --> 02:11:01.449]  The day before Trump made those remarks on Friday.
[02:11:01.810 --> 02:11:05.210]  On Friday he said, you're never going to have to vote again after you vote for me this one time.
[02:11:05.909 --> 02:11:12.970]  The day before that, on Thursday last week, he didn't say that people wouldn't have to vote anymore once he was elected this November.
[02:11:13.489 --> 02:11:22.850]  Now, the day before that, on Thursday, he told his supporters, not that they're not going to have to vote again, but that they don't have to vote this time.
[02:11:24.069 --> 02:11:26.850]  But they don't need to vote for him this November.
[02:11:30.250 --> 02:11:32.229]  My instruction, we don't need the votes.
[02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:33.289]  I have so many votes.
[02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:36.529]  My instruction, we don't need the votes.
[02:11:36.529 --> 02:11:37.750]  I have so many votes.
[02:11:38.050 --> 02:11:39.750]  He said that on Thursday last week.
[02:11:41.010 --> 02:11:45.189]  And it turns out this is something, when you look, he says this all the time now.
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:50.420]  My instruction, we don't need the votes.
[02:11:50.579 --> 02:11:51.500]  I have so many votes.
[02:11:51.659 --> 02:11:52.659]  We don't need votes.
[02:11:52.899 --> 02:11:55.239]  I tell my people, I don't need any votes.
[02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:56.600]  We got all the votes we need.
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:11:57.239]  I don't need votes.
[02:11:57.319 --> 02:11:58.000]  We don't need votes.
[02:11:58.239 --> 02:12:00.619]  We got more votes than anybody's ever had.
[02:12:00.859 --> 02:12:01.560]  You don't have to vote.
[02:12:01.659 --> 02:12:02.520]  Don't worry about voting.
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:04.180]  The voting, we got plenty of votes.
[02:12:05.159 --> 02:12:06.180]  Don't worry about voting.
[02:12:09.210 --> 02:12:15.390]  Of all the weirdness around this campaign, this is a truly strange thing to tell people, right?
[02:12:16.130 --> 02:12:16.789]  Don't vote.
[02:12:16.909 --> 02:12:17.670]  I don't need your vote.
[02:12:17.670 --> 02:12:18.430]  I don't want your vote.
[02:12:20.069 --> 02:12:23.170]  I mean, all the surface level weirdness is, you know, worth noting.
[02:12:23.609 --> 02:12:29.569]  Having a new position on literally anything you can think of as soon as any random rich guy tells you to, that's a weird thing.
[02:12:29.710 --> 02:12:37.750]  Picking the eccentric billionaire's intern for your running mate, even though you apparently had no idea who he was or what a disaster he is on television, all of this is weird.
[02:12:38.350 --> 02:12:43.670]  But telling voters, do not bother to vote for me, it doesn't matter if you do, I don't need your votes.
[02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:46.449]  That is a thing that should prick up your ears.
[02:12:46.989 --> 02:12:53.050]  Because what that means, Is that he doesn't think he needs to win the vote to win the election.
[02:12:53.770 --> 02:12:57.210]  He doesn't think he needs to win the election in order to take power.
[02:12:58.329 --> 02:13:04.130]  He thinks something other than votes is going to determine whether or not he gets back in the White House.
[02:13:06.819 --> 02:13:09.180]  I tell my people, I don't need any votes.
[02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:10.520]  We got all the votes we need.
[02:13:10.659 --> 02:13:11.180]  I don't need votes.
[02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:13.659]  All I want to do is make sure that we guard our vote.
[02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:14.199]  It's guard.
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:16.340]  We stop the steal, okay?
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:17.699]  You know, there's a lot of expressions.
[02:13:18.140 --> 02:13:19.359]  I want the vote guarded.
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:20.779]  I want the steal stopped.
[02:13:21.100 --> 02:13:22.180]  Because we don't need the votes.
[02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:22.899]  We have the votes.
[02:13:22.979 --> 02:13:24.100]  We have more votes than we need.
[02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:29.420]  What we need, I tell these guys, I tell even RNC, I tell Michael, I tell Laura, I don't care.
[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:30.680]  We have all the votes.
[02:13:32.380 --> 02:13:33.460]  That's 100% clear.
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:36.619]  And he goes on to explain, they stole the last election.
[02:13:37.239 --> 02:13:42.699]  If we have the poll watchers and we're there and our votes get counted, like Carrie Lake said, she said they didn't count a bunch of our votes.
[02:13:43.159 --> 02:13:47.640]  You watch, you go get all the ones with the machines were broke or we'll fill this out for you or whatever.
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:51.979]  And they got them and sure enough, she's now going to get up there if they actually count them.
[02:13:54.239 --> 02:13:55.220]  And Trump was right.
[02:13:55.500 --> 02:13:59.199]  And she also says this thing, oh, Trump says you'll never have to vote again.
[02:14:00.380 --> 02:14:01.479]  And then she's smart.
[02:14:01.619 --> 02:14:02.680]  She says the lie first.
[02:14:02.779 --> 02:14:03.840]  She says, vote for me again.
[02:14:04.619 --> 02:14:07.020]  Because he goes on to say, you've seen it.
[02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:08.000]  Should I play it for you?
[02:14:08.060 --> 02:14:08.479]  We got it.
[02:14:09.239 --> 02:14:12.720]  He goes on to say, because this is the last time I'm running.
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:15.060]  If I lose this or they steal it, I'm done.
[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:15.760]  It's your problem.
[02:14:16.039 --> 02:14:19.840]  That's what he said last Sunday when he said they're trying like hell to steal it again.
[02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:21.180]  But we're going to win.
[02:14:21.340 --> 02:14:23.500]  We're going to overpower them and we're watching this time.
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:25.420]  But whatever happens, it's your fight.
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:26.159]  I've done my best.
[02:14:26.279 --> 02:14:27.140]  This is my last time.
[02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:28.779]  It's the last time you got to vote for me.
[02:14:30.529 --> 02:14:32.390]  It's like when a rock band goes on its farewell tour.
[02:14:32.470 --> 02:14:33.649]  It's the last time you can see me.
[02:14:34.170 --> 02:14:35.329]  He's 78 years old.
[02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:36.229]  It is the last time.
[02:14:37.729 --> 02:14:40.210]  He didn't say, you'll never vote again.
[02:14:40.590 --> 02:14:42.970]  That's been going on for six months when he says that speech.
[02:14:43.130 --> 02:14:44.229]  It's my last time running.
[02:14:44.329 --> 02:14:45.189]  Last time you can vote for me.
[02:14:45.289 --> 02:14:46.350]  It's the last time you gotta vote for me.
[02:14:46.390 --> 02:14:47.329]  Just do it this one time.
[02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:48.510]  He said, this is it.
[02:14:49.710 --> 02:14:52.590]  This is our last chance to save the country.
[02:14:52.590 --> 02:14:53.489]  He adds that point.
[02:14:53.590 --> 02:14:54.090]  You've heard that.
[02:14:55.479 --> 02:14:57.960]  That turns into, we'll never vote again.
[02:14:58.100 --> 02:15:01.199]  Headline, Trump will never vote again, meaning he'll be a dictator.
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.140]  God, these people are so deceptive.
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:15.760]  And I'm the one saying we should stop responding to all their lies because they don't have the big audiences, but maybe we should because that's what got people who weren't even paying attention to realize they're the bad guys.
[02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:20.699]  Because the really people that are the problem aren't even the evil, dumb people on their side.
[02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:23.789]  And we've got the good people that are informed and engaged.
[02:15:23.970 --> 02:15:24.529]  They're the good guys.
[02:15:24.710 --> 02:15:27.510]  It's the people that just go, well, it's so corrupt, I'm not going to get involved.
[02:15:28.590 --> 02:15:31.310]  Oh, Alex, you're telling us to vote, but it's corrupt.
[02:15:31.609 --> 02:15:32.869]  Yeah, we'll overpower it.
[02:15:32.970 --> 02:15:33.630]  We'll show it.
[02:15:33.729 --> 02:15:34.729]  We'll keep engaging it.
[02:15:34.930 --> 02:15:39.689]  You don't give up when something's bad like this because you're going to be ruled over if you don't.
[02:15:39.729 --> 02:15:42.789]  It's not like you don't like a restaurant so you don't go back there.
[02:15:42.869 --> 02:15:44.229]  You don't like a school where you pull your kid out.
[02:15:44.289 --> 02:15:45.010]  This is the country.
[02:15:46.529 --> 02:15:47.630]  And there's nowhere to go.
[02:15:47.890 --> 02:15:49.369]  We're the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[02:15:50.739 --> 02:15:52.319]  And people are apologizing a lot to me.
[02:15:52.399 --> 02:15:53.600]  I don't care about it for my ego.
[02:15:53.739 --> 02:15:54.779]  I care about it for you being smart.
[02:15:54.979 --> 02:15:55.960]  I see all of our acts.
[02:15:56.060 --> 02:15:56.619]  I get the calls.
[02:15:56.819 --> 02:15:58.079]  Hey, man, I thought you were wrong.
[02:15:58.180 --> 02:15:59.359]  I didn't think we could overpower fraud.
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:02.340]  Well, I mean, they mitigated it.
[02:16:02.439 --> 02:16:03.720]  They got caught doing it.
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:04.420]  And that's another thing.
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:05.579]  I have not made this point.
[02:16:05.739 --> 02:16:07.319]  This is really important.
[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:08.920]  I'm going to make this tomorrow.
[02:16:09.239 --> 02:16:10.800]  I'm going to do special videos on this.
[02:16:10.899 --> 02:16:11.699]  I'm going to write this down.
[02:16:15.060 --> 02:16:17.380]  We need a 2024 investigation.
[02:16:19.260 --> 02:16:24.579]  Just because we stopped them and mitigated it, it took years to get the proof on 2020.
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:29.619]  We've got to finish those investigations and prosecute the people and expose it so they can't do it again.
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:36.399]  And they tried and got caught all over the place and admit illegal aliens are voting everywhere and federal judges are saying they can vote.
[02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:39.139]  And the Secretary of State in Texas said they can vote five weeks ago.
[02:16:39.299 --> 02:16:42.100]  It's like, wow, you really got caught with your pants down.
[02:16:43.059 --> 02:16:46.219]  You really got caught with your hand in the cookie jar.
[02:16:47.420 --> 02:16:50.020]  So that is really important that we need to...
[02:16:50.020 --> 02:16:50.940]  Oh, we won.
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:51.379]  We won.
[02:16:51.459 --> 02:16:52.260]  Let's move on now.
[02:16:52.420 --> 02:16:52.620]  No.
[02:16:53.020 --> 02:16:56.379]  You won a rigged game because you overpowered their ass.
[02:16:57.079 --> 02:16:59.860]  Be like doing a boxing match and the guy's got brass knuckles.
[02:16:59.879 --> 02:17:00.899]  You got regular gloves.
[02:17:01.559 --> 02:17:03.020]  Okay, you won that match.
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:05.540]  Next time you go, hey, by the way, the next time the guy's got to wear gloves.
[02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:11.500]  Because next time, if you don't make them wear gloves, they're going to have a butcher knife in there.
[02:17:11.739 --> 02:17:13.420]  They're going to have a fucking baseball bat.
[02:17:16.479 --> 02:17:18.239]  Yeah, put the lake thing up, because I don't have the latest.
[02:17:20.899 --> 02:17:26.639]  Sitting in the marshals, Arizona officials caught changing the ballot totals as counting for U.S. Senate continues.
[02:17:26.819 --> 02:17:27.440]  Yeah, you knew it.
[02:17:27.479 --> 02:17:27.819]  I knew that.
[02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:28.379]  Oh, boy.
[02:17:28.479 --> 02:17:29.319]  They really hate her.
[02:17:30.180 --> 02:17:31.319]  They see a winner there.
[02:17:31.739 --> 02:17:33.239]  That's presidential material right there.
[02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:35.000]  They don't want a smart woman up there.
[02:17:35.100 --> 02:17:39.319]  They don't want the Republicans getting Tulsi and her in position for 2028.
[02:17:40.860 --> 02:17:41.840]  Just so you know.
[02:17:45.090 --> 02:17:49.250]  I'll vote for a woman so fast to make your head spin if they're smart and patriotic.
[02:17:49.329 --> 02:17:50.129]  And they are.
[02:17:50.549 --> 02:17:51.930]  You Republicans don't want a woman.
[02:17:52.069 --> 02:17:54.649]  Oh, is that why Trump just made it the first female chief of staff?
[02:17:55.569 --> 02:17:56.510]  Because she's good.
[02:17:57.010 --> 02:17:57.690]  She's smart.
[02:18:00.010 --> 02:18:01.129]  Roger vouches for her.
[02:18:01.250 --> 02:18:02.790]  I know she sure got Trump's act together.
[02:18:03.530 --> 02:18:08.510]  She sure ran the operation getting the folks with Laura Trump in there to stop the fraud or mitigate it.
[02:18:09.489 --> 02:18:10.350]  So there's that.
[02:18:11.260 --> 02:18:12.600]  Now, this guy's some actor.
[02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:13.899]  I've seen him in some movies.
[02:18:13.959 --> 02:18:14.760]  He's a real joke.
[02:18:15.180 --> 02:18:21.739]  And without even looking, the last few days, I've seen probably 15 or more of these type of videos.
[02:18:21.879 --> 02:18:22.860]  So this is a talking point.
[02:18:23.260 --> 02:18:27.399]  You always know a talking point because you see it everywhere at once, and they all say the exact same thing.
[02:18:27.459 --> 02:18:34.959]  And the guy's reading off a script on his screen, and he brings out dozens of the standard lies.
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:36.979]  Trump doesn't have big audiences.
[02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:42.020]  Trump got hit in the ear by a giant bullet.
[02:18:42.100 --> 02:18:43.280]  And this is a bullet.
[02:18:43.459 --> 02:18:46.639]  No, this is a.50 caliber cartridge with the round in it.
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:47.879]  This is an unspent round.
[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:50.639]  This is a live cartridge.
[02:18:50.959 --> 02:19:04.819]  And you put it in the barrel and a firing pin hits the white powder detonator, the cap, and it ignites the rest of the white powder and it forces with gas the projectile down the barrel, the tube, and then it goes out of its target.
[02:19:05.579 --> 02:19:07.879]  So Trump wasn't hit by this in the air.
[02:19:08.299 --> 02:19:21.600]  Trump was hit by a tiny 5.56 bullet, not the cartridge, but the grazing barely touched him.
[02:19:21.739 --> 02:19:22.620]  That was the trajectory.
[02:19:24.059 --> 02:19:34.620]  And again, you can watch high-speed shooting videos where people I mean, a really good shot at 100 yards with a 5.56 with a good scope.
[02:19:35.280 --> 02:19:38.079]  You can also put it in clamps so you get it exact.
[02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:42.200]  And I meant to recreate this myself, but I've been too busy to get out to an open air range to do it.
[02:19:42.420 --> 02:19:54.200]  And you can sit there and dial that raffle in and shoot closer and closer until you just graze the paper so small there's a tiny little indentation.
[02:19:54.739 --> 02:19:55.100]  See?
[02:19:56.479 --> 02:19:57.500]  That's how bullets work.
[02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:09.260]  Now, if you hit somebody in the shoulder with one of these, it's just the bullet on the end, and it goes through flesh, it's a little hole where it goes in and a little hole where it goes out.
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:23.899]  But if it hits a bone, the bullet expands into a mushroom, It's going 2,500 miles an hour on average, depending on how far it's shooting.
[02:20:24.319 --> 02:20:26.739]  Comes out of the barrel at 26, 2700, depending on the grain.
[02:20:29.379 --> 02:20:36.420]  And it goes poof, and there's a gaseous explosion from the gas around it.
[02:20:36.659 --> 02:20:40.540]  And it hits the bone, and the bone shatters and shoots bone pieces everywhere.
[02:20:40.780 --> 02:20:45.319]  And the bullet, a 5.56, usually breaks up, unless it's a full metal jacket.
[02:20:46.559 --> 02:20:51.459]  And then it explodes in you, and a giant hole shoots out the back of your shoulder.
[02:20:52.299 --> 02:20:56.399]  So if it grazes you, it just nicks.
[02:20:57.180 --> 02:21:09.719]  But if it would have hit Trump here, it would have blown the skull, blow out his eye, and gas ejection of pressure would have blown the brain up into the skull, and he'd be a vegetable at best.
[02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:13.840]  If it hits you here, like Kennedy...
[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:29.760]  Little hole goes through the skull, starts mushrooming, hits the brain, and then the explosive disturbance with gas shoots the brain back, and the back of the head goes, show Zapruder film, please.
[02:21:33.020 --> 02:21:33.680]  All right?
[02:21:33.940 --> 02:21:36.040]  So this is for the guy we're about to show.
[02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:38.920]  Now, obviously, dum-dum here.
[02:21:40.729 --> 02:21:41.690]  Probably knows this.
[02:21:41.930 --> 02:21:57.569]  He's reading a script for super hardcore leftist morons that think that when you put a cartridge, not the bullet, the bullet's at the end of the cartridge,
[02:21:58.110 --> 02:22:05.290]  into a rifle and pull the trigger that this fires.
[02:22:05.290 --> 02:22:08.090]  No, just the tip, the bullet.
[02:22:09.889 --> 02:22:11.190]  It's like a.50 cal.
[02:22:11.409 --> 02:22:15.010]  When you fire a.50 cal rifle, it doesn't fire this.
[02:22:15.090 --> 02:22:18.829]  This stays in the gun unless it's semi-auto and ejects it out the side.
[02:22:19.389 --> 02:22:31.209]  If it's single shot bolt action or lever action, this stays in until you pull it back, it ejects, and another one goes into the barrel.
[02:22:34.170 --> 02:22:36.250]  I know our listeners know this, our viewers.
[02:22:36.370 --> 02:22:39.430]  I'm sorry to have to explain to people that 1 plus 1 equals 2.
[02:22:39.649 --> 02:22:41.010]  But that's for the left.
[02:22:41.829 --> 02:22:43.829]  Why Trump got hit by this.
[02:22:44.229 --> 02:22:46.489]  Ooh, it blown me off.
[02:22:47.309 --> 02:22:47.670]  Why?
[02:22:48.629 --> 02:22:49.190]  Why?
[02:22:49.469 --> 02:22:50.170]  Look at that.
[02:22:50.309 --> 02:22:52.530]  That's almost, that's two inches long.
[02:22:52.850 --> 02:22:56.729]  Why is that that, you know, hit either side, blow ear off?
[02:23:00.700 --> 02:23:01.700]  God help these people.
[02:23:02.799 --> 02:23:05.079]  So this guy is Bozo the Clown.
[02:23:06.500 --> 02:23:08.379]  But it would take an hour to go about this.
[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:09.700]  Everything he says is a lie.
[02:23:09.920 --> 02:23:16.920]  I know viewers know this, but for leftists that are tuning in that want to see what the show's about, this is a person lying to you.
[02:23:17.420 --> 02:23:24.760]  I can show you Trump rallies with 30,000 people get in and a million don't.
[02:23:26.149 --> 02:23:28.590]  January 6th, the Park Service said over a million.
[02:23:28.809 --> 02:23:29.370]  I was there.
[02:23:29.950 --> 02:23:32.530]  I had a ticket into the Ellipse front row.
[02:23:33.329 --> 02:23:34.969]  30,000 got in.
[02:23:35.450 --> 02:23:36.809]  A million didn't.
[02:23:36.930 --> 02:23:41.809]  They were all far as the eye could see red, up the Washington Monument, up the hill, just everywhere.
[02:23:42.450 --> 02:23:44.149]  Hundreds of thousands went marching to the Capitol.
[02:23:44.809 --> 02:23:47.510]  A few hundred were provocateurs, started fights with the cops.
[02:23:48.659 --> 02:23:52.700]  He uses examples of Pennsylvania and stuff where 30,000, 20,000 are in the arena.
[02:23:53.260 --> 02:23:55.840]  Local police report, 500,000 didn't get in.
[02:23:57.040 --> 02:23:58.459]  And this is the lie.
[02:23:58.680 --> 02:24:00.760]  And then they say he didn't have big crowds.
[02:24:00.899 --> 02:24:01.739]  He did not popular.
[02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:02.299]  He didn't.
[02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:11.440]  And then he goes on to say he can't believe Trump got higher numbers this time than last time.
[02:24:14.180 --> 02:24:15.659]  Do you believe that really...
[02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:21.780]  Biden got 17 million more four years ago than Harris?
[02:24:21.899 --> 02:24:23.360]  No, those are the fraudulent votes.
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:25.920]  And everybody sees right through it, the numbers show it.
[02:24:26.059 --> 02:24:29.479]  But because they were being watched this time, they couldn't do it at that level.
[02:24:30.959 --> 02:24:39.879]  But everybody knows that an incumbent, generally even if they win re-election, doesn't get higher numbers than last time, unless you're Ronald Reagan or Nixon.
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:40.979]  Those are the anomalies.
[02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:44.440]  Everybody hated Harris and the bad economy.
[02:24:44.700 --> 02:24:47.040]  And of course, it makes sense he got more votes.
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:58.540]  But again, they didn't just steal 2020 by giving more illegal votes for Biden, but it was by machines breaking everywhere, the wrong size, ballots in the key districts in Texas.
[02:24:59.079 --> 02:25:00.680]  They didn't lose Texas, but they tried.
[02:25:00.920 --> 02:25:02.920]  In Houston and in Maricopa County, Arizona.
[02:25:03.479 --> 02:25:06.620]  And so they, oh, these didn't work, or oh, come back later.
[02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:08.940]  And then they shelve them and don't count the Republican votes.
[02:25:09.219 --> 02:25:10.200]  Lake knew their trick.
[02:25:10.819 --> 02:25:13.340]  She said, watch, once we get into those, she's way behind.
[02:25:13.540 --> 02:25:16.799]  Now she went, because they're almost all for her and Trump.
[02:25:17.620 --> 02:25:18.100]  See?
[02:25:19.879 --> 02:25:21.979]  So, that's what they do.
[02:25:22.059 --> 02:25:26.100]  And this guy's sitting there telling you Trump didn't get hit.
[02:25:26.239 --> 02:25:27.799]  You couldn't fake that.
[02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:29.520]  The guy shoots six times.
[02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:30.739]  Trump's moving around.
[02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:33.299]  Almost hits him right on trajectory for right here.
[02:25:33.540 --> 02:25:33.879]  Moves.
[02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:35.260]  Grazes him.
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:36.559]  Bleeds right there.
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:39.020]  And again, I've been shot in the ear.
[02:25:40.520 --> 02:25:42.379]  22 caliber pellet gun.
[02:25:43.620 --> 02:25:44.879]  10 years old.
[02:25:45.479 --> 02:25:46.120]  East Texas.
[02:25:46.780 --> 02:25:49.059]  Took one of my city friends down there for two days.
[02:25:49.299 --> 02:25:51.180]  My dad drops us off Friday afternoon.
[02:25:51.979 --> 02:25:53.659]  Comes back Sunday afternoon.
[02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:55.059]  We're about to leave.
[02:25:55.379 --> 02:25:59.000]  I've got a 777 or 177 regular BB gun.
[02:25:59.239 --> 02:26:04.180]  He's barring my uncle's one pump 22 caliber pellet guns.
[02:26:04.340 --> 02:26:05.000]  Big, big pellet.
[02:26:05.899 --> 02:26:08.360]  And for whatever reason, my grandma didn't like the kid.
[02:26:08.459 --> 02:26:09.100]  I don't know him for many years.
[02:26:09.219 --> 02:26:09.940]  Pretty nice kid.
[02:26:10.059 --> 02:26:10.600]  Like a nerd.
[02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:12.979]  We're about to leave.
[02:26:13.079 --> 02:26:13.940]  My dad's almost there.
[02:26:14.180 --> 02:26:16.059]  We're out in the woods behind the house shooting stuff.
[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:18.299]  He just shoots me right in the ear.
[02:26:20.450 --> 02:26:22.950]  And it goes just worse than Trump.
[02:26:23.110 --> 02:26:24.090]  That just grazed the edge of here.
[02:26:24.250 --> 02:26:26.309]  It shot me right in the back here.
[02:26:26.389 --> 02:26:30.469]  There's still a little bit of lead there, so it's like, you look up there, it's kind of like a blue spot, like a gray spot.
[02:26:30.590 --> 02:26:34.450]  It's like if somebody stabbed you with a pencil, back when they were still lead, or graphite would make a mark on you.
[02:26:34.690 --> 02:26:35.629]  I had one of those when I was a kid, too.
[02:26:35.709 --> 02:26:36.209]  It was accidental.
[02:26:36.409 --> 02:26:42.729]  I had the pencil on my deal, and I was wrestling a kid at the bus stop, weren't really fighting, and they just jabbed at me and then broke off.
[02:26:42.809 --> 02:26:51.479]  But the point is, is that It bled like a son of a bitch.
[02:26:52.979 --> 02:26:57.319]  But I'm in school days later, and people are like, where is it?
[02:26:58.139 --> 02:26:59.780]  You got shot with a pellet gun.
[02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:00.479]  Where is it?
[02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:01.500]  Where's the hole?
[02:27:02.079 --> 02:27:05.659]  Because it's cartilage, and it bleeds really bad.
[02:27:05.719 --> 02:27:07.799]  It has a lot of blood vessels, but it closes off quickly.
[02:27:08.219 --> 02:27:10.139]  And unlike regular skin, it's not red.
[02:27:11.079 --> 02:27:15.340]  And so I remember looking, and it's just like when you pierce an ear, it closes back up.
[02:27:16.250 --> 02:27:17.850]  You could hardly even see the hole.
[02:27:17.989 --> 02:27:20.069]  Even though it's.22 caliber, you know, it's bigger than a regular pellet.
[02:27:20.170 --> 02:27:22.950]  You couldn't really see the hole because it closed up right away.
[02:27:23.569 --> 02:27:27.909]  And then once it totally healed, you'd see a little blue spot there where some lead stayed in the flesh.
[02:27:28.129 --> 02:27:30.149]  And I'm so tan and old now.
[02:27:30.229 --> 02:27:33.649]  I try to look at the mirror and kind of see the scars, a little scar, but it just went bloop.
[02:27:34.209 --> 02:27:35.829]  And, you know, through there.
[02:27:35.969 --> 02:27:38.909]  But, I mean, that's what happens.
[02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:40.489]  I've been shot in the ear.
[02:27:40.549 --> 02:27:43.329]  And it bled like a pig all over the place.
[02:27:44.959 --> 02:27:47.079]  My grandmother flipped out, thought I was going to die.
[02:27:47.559 --> 02:27:48.299]  It didn't really hurt.
[02:27:48.479 --> 02:27:49.219]  She's like, wow.
[02:27:49.719 --> 02:27:53.700]  But once it stopped bleeding, it didn't, it just, it seals up.
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:55.899]  So that's what happened.
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:27:58.340]  And they've been saying they want to kill him.
[02:27:58.479 --> 02:28:00.399]  And they celebrated trying to kill him.
[02:28:01.239 --> 02:28:02.680]  You can't fake that.
[02:28:03.700 --> 02:28:05.979]  I mean, he killed one guy, wounded two others.
[02:28:07.379 --> 02:28:13.239]  The top sniper in the world can't sit there 140 yards away and then just accidentally graze his ear.
[02:28:14.370 --> 02:28:16.250]  It's horse crap, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:16.590 --> 02:28:17.450]  It's real.
[02:28:17.569 --> 02:28:18.329]  This is all real.
[02:28:18.430 --> 02:28:19.950]  This is a real struggle against globalists.
[02:28:20.069 --> 02:28:21.229]  They're really pissed off.
[02:28:21.329 --> 02:28:22.069]  They're really losing.
[02:28:22.209 --> 02:28:22.950]  It's really happening.
[02:28:23.389 --> 02:28:25.389]  But this guy reads off a script.
[02:28:25.790 --> 02:28:27.149]  The script is everywhere.
[02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:29.870]  That Trump said he doesn't need votes because he's got it.
[02:28:30.129 --> 02:28:32.110]  And Trump says it's the last time you'll ever vote.
[02:28:32.250 --> 02:28:34.409]  It's the last time you'll ever vote for him!
[02:28:35.399 --> 02:28:37.879]  If they just played the next five seconds, he says that.
[02:28:38.420 --> 02:28:39.840]  Because this is the last time.
[02:28:40.020 --> 02:28:41.879]  If they steal it or I lose, this is it.
[02:28:41.959 --> 02:28:43.059]  It's up to you to fix it.
[02:28:43.500 --> 02:28:44.920]  He said it again last Sunday.
[02:28:45.079 --> 02:28:46.899]  I played the damn speech four times this week.
[02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:49.780]  But they don't care.
[02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:53.159]  Trump says no more voting after he wins.
[02:28:53.280 --> 02:28:54.079]  He's going to be a dictator.
[02:28:54.299 --> 02:28:56.260]  That is criminal lying, folks.
[02:28:58.620 --> 02:29:02.579]  And then they sign executive orders and tell the military to get ready for martial law and to kill citizens.
[02:29:02.979 --> 02:29:04.100]  They got that all ready.
[02:29:04.260 --> 02:29:05.879]  They're still in power for 70 more days.
[02:29:06.379 --> 02:29:08.180]  And they're saying Trump's going to use the military.
[02:29:08.500 --> 02:29:09.799]  Just played you the CNN clip.
[02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:14.520]  What are they planning where he'll have to use the military?
[02:29:17.700 --> 02:29:18.280]  Oh, good.
[02:29:18.420 --> 02:29:19.200]  This is really great news.
[02:29:19.319 --> 02:29:22.299]  Trump just put this on X. The real Donald Trump.
[02:29:23.260 --> 02:29:24.340]  You know, it's incoming.
[02:29:24.340 --> 02:29:26.680]  He's about to say no to Mike Pompeo.
[02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:30.100]  I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley or former Secretary of State.
[02:29:30.219 --> 02:29:30.879]  Oh, it is there.
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:32.459]  Oh, this is such good news.
[02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:33.760]  I only read the top line.
[02:29:33.819 --> 02:29:34.520]  I was like, oh, Nikki Haley.
[02:29:34.620 --> 02:29:36.799]  Oh, I said, I bet it's Pompeo next.
[02:29:36.879 --> 02:29:37.860]  Oh, I hadn't read it yet.
[02:29:38.020 --> 02:29:38.639]  Oh, sorry.
[02:29:54.500 --> 02:29:57.180]  Make America great again.
[02:29:57.680 --> 02:29:59.319]  What did I tell you yesterday?
[02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:02.040]  I know we have a limited crew.
[02:30:02.139 --> 02:30:02.659]  They do a great job.
[02:30:02.739 --> 02:30:03.799]  That's why I wish we had more funds.
[02:30:03.920 --> 02:30:07.079]  I'd have like two people just writing down everything I say so we'd have it instantly for you.
[02:30:07.340 --> 02:30:08.840]  But listeners, you can do it.
[02:30:09.040 --> 02:30:14.739]  You can go to yesterday's four-hour show, and I think I said twice, and I told the story not to brag.
[02:30:15.260 --> 02:30:20.579]  I explained that I used to give Trump data and info who was bad in the White House because everybody else was scared to do it.
[02:30:20.739 --> 02:30:21.319]  Well, now they're not.
[02:30:22.079 --> 02:30:23.000]  Because they get kicked out.
[02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:24.399]  Because there's more bad guys than good guys.
[02:30:24.500 --> 02:30:26.020]  Now there's way more good guys than bad guys.
[02:30:26.219 --> 02:30:27.360]  It's a different setup.
[02:30:28.319 --> 02:30:29.379]  Trump's not naive now.
[02:30:30.399 --> 02:30:34.200]  And Roger Stone calls me yesterday morning.
[02:30:36.819 --> 02:30:38.159]  Or no, it was Thursday night.
[02:30:41.260 --> 02:30:42.440]  And he's...
[02:30:42.440 --> 02:30:44.479]  No, no, no.
[02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:45.159]  I called him.
[02:30:45.299 --> 02:30:45.739]  He texted me.
[02:30:45.780 --> 02:30:46.299]  I called him back.
[02:30:47.260 --> 02:30:48.020]  I was trying to get him on the show.
[02:30:48.139 --> 02:30:48.899]  He goes, I'm too exhausted.
[02:30:49.020 --> 02:30:50.020]  I'll have more to say this weekend.
[02:30:50.020 --> 02:30:50.819]  I'll come on Sunday.
[02:30:51.100 --> 02:30:51.959]  Shit, nine shows.
[02:30:52.120 --> 02:30:52.500]  Oh, my God.
[02:30:52.940 --> 02:30:54.280]  I'm really trying to help Trump with the transition.
[02:30:54.440 --> 02:30:56.479]  Geez, we're trying to put bad people in, but we're catching them all.
[02:30:56.559 --> 02:30:57.319]  Oh, God, I'm exhausted.
[02:30:57.840 --> 02:30:58.520]  I mean, this is what he's doing.
[02:30:58.680 --> 02:30:59.639]  He works hard.
[02:30:59.719 --> 02:31:00.579]  Harder than I do a lot of time.
[02:31:01.459 --> 02:31:04.139]  And he goes, put to me in favor.
[02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:12.610]  I was on Jack Vosobiec's show, and he says he has this clip of Pompeo laughing about Trump and the raid, saying he's guilty, but I can't find it when you find it.
[02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:14.870]  I found it in five seconds and sent it to him.
[02:31:14.909 --> 02:31:17.930]  He wrote an article about it, stayed up that night, and it came out Friday.
[02:31:18.690 --> 02:31:31.219]  But I told the story Friday, and I'm not going to tell the rest of it, but let's just say, I said this yesterday, Trump was shown that clip and others, because we found more, We got him to him.
[02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:32.899]  Roger got him to him.
[02:31:32.959 --> 02:31:34.819]  And let's just say Trump wasn't very pleased.
[02:31:34.940 --> 02:31:37.059]  Because Trump didn't know Pompeo did that.
[02:31:37.260 --> 02:31:39.180]  But see how easy our job is?
[02:31:39.760 --> 02:31:45.200]  And I said, within a few days, Trump is going to say he's not going to get close to Pompeo.
[02:31:45.559 --> 02:31:47.520]  I'm going to frame this and put it on the wall.
[02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:50.500]  Because this is the next fight is keeping these people out.
[02:31:50.559 --> 02:31:51.719]  And not just the big bad ones.
[02:31:52.579 --> 02:31:55.100]  A few minutes of research even on mid-level people.
[02:31:55.340 --> 02:31:59.620]  We're on your ass and we got a conduit straight into Trump and so do a bunch of other people.
[02:32:00.599 --> 02:32:03.899]  So, oh my gosh, I'm glad I went longer than two hours.
[02:32:05.780 --> 02:32:06.840]  Promise some family.
[02:32:06.959 --> 02:32:08.579]  I'll be home about 5.30, I promise.
[02:32:08.719 --> 02:32:10.299]  Oh, you won't just do two hours.
[02:32:10.420 --> 02:32:11.159]  Well, I just can't.
[02:32:13.319 --> 02:32:14.600]  Oh, man, this is awesome.
[02:32:15.780 --> 02:32:21.739]  I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to join the Trump administration, which is currently in formation.
[02:32:21.739 --> 02:32:26.540]  I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously and would like to thank them for their service to our country.
[02:32:26.639 --> 02:32:27.280]  Make America great again.
[02:32:28.479 --> 02:32:30.579]  Well, if you can have a mental orgasm, I just had one.
[02:32:30.760 --> 02:32:32.200]  I need to fire a cigarette up or something.
[02:32:32.360 --> 02:32:33.040]  I mean, good lord.
[02:32:39.219 --> 02:32:39.879]  Oh, man.
[02:32:40.159 --> 02:32:40.340]  Woo!
[02:32:41.579 --> 02:32:41.920]  Yeah!
[02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:44.120]  This is good.
[02:32:44.739 --> 02:32:47.399]  It's a little prelude of things to come.
[02:32:47.579 --> 02:32:48.280]  Okay, let's stop there.
[02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:52.719]  Let's play this clip of this liar reading all the script.
[02:32:52.840 --> 02:32:53.120]  Here it is.
[02:32:54.020 --> 02:32:55.659]  Let me make sure I've got this right.
[02:32:58.430 --> 02:33:04.309]  Last time he lost the popular vote essentially by almost 8 million.
[02:33:05.129 --> 02:33:09.610]  And this time he won the popular by almost 5 million.
[02:33:10.930 --> 02:33:31.340]  So you want me to believe that this guy who already lost last time, who lost the popular vote in 2016 and 2020, Got 13 million votes more popular after January 6th,
[02:33:31.620 --> 02:33:45.840]  after 91 felony indictments, after 34 felony convictions, after espionage charges, after the E. Jean Carroll sexual assault rulings, two of them, two juries.
[02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:51.979]  After CFO went to prison twice.
[02:33:53.260 --> 02:34:04.239]  After every lawyer that ever met him got disbarred and half of them put in jail, his rallies were smaller than they've ever been.
[02:34:04.600 --> 02:34:10.940]  And even in venues that were 5,000 and 7,000, he couldn't fill them.
[02:34:11.399 --> 02:34:14.379]  And people were leaving before they were over.
[02:34:15.780 --> 02:34:19.120]  And he's 13 million votes more popular?
[02:34:21.879 --> 02:34:22.600]  Hmm.
[02:34:24.559 --> 02:34:25.479]  I don't buy it.
[02:34:26.979 --> 02:34:27.379]  Sorry.
[02:34:27.639 --> 02:34:32.360]  I don't know if that's what y'all want to hear or not, but I don't fucking buy it, man.
[02:34:32.860 --> 02:34:33.719]  All right, pause for a minute.
[02:34:34.159 --> 02:34:40.040]  We've got to take this video for tomorrow's show, and I want to put it on X, and just show his giant crowds.
[02:34:40.559 --> 02:34:42.979]  And hell, show my crowds, or show Tucker's.
[02:34:43.100 --> 02:34:47.860]  I mean, in the middle of nowhere, 20,000 people come out to see me in Tucker in Pennsylvania.
[02:34:49.239 --> 02:34:53.239]  They're getting 40, 50, 80, 100,000 at the Trump rallies.
[02:34:54.510 --> 02:34:57.889]  And, oh yeah, look at that tiny crowd.
[02:34:59.110 --> 02:35:01.229]  And then you can just pan back, the whole thing's full.
[02:35:01.409 --> 02:35:05.190]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[02:35:05.610 --> 02:35:11.610]  I've seen three times more Trump signs in Austin, and it's usually more Democrat signs than that.
[02:35:11.709 --> 02:35:12.909]  People are sick of this crap.
[02:35:13.170 --> 02:35:16.430]  But let's go back to this guy reading off a script.
[02:35:16.430 --> 02:35:16.909]  Here it is.
[02:35:19.149 --> 02:35:21.110]  But I don't fucking buy it, man.
[02:35:22.889 --> 02:35:33.309]  I don't buy it any more than I buy him saying that 100,000 people turned out to his New Jersey rally when it was proven that the space only holds 30,000 and wasn't full.
[02:35:34.409 --> 02:35:46.690]  I don't buy it any more than him saying he got shot by an AR-15 bullet but his ear magically healed and there's not even a scratch or scar to show from a bullet this big hitting him in the ear.
[02:35:48.930 --> 02:35:49.670]  I don't buy it.
[02:35:49.770 --> 02:35:51.629]  I just don't buy any of it.
[02:35:51.809 --> 02:35:54.510]  I think, I don't know.
[02:35:54.690 --> 02:35:55.930]  I'm not cocky.
[02:35:55.950 --> 02:36:01.370]  I'm not cocky enough to tell you what's happening, but I don't buy this.
[02:36:02.969 --> 02:36:07.889]  And I'm interested to see if the real United States government is going to buy it.
[02:36:08.930 --> 02:36:15.190]  I still have faith in my government to do what has to be done to handle these people.
[02:36:15.829 --> 02:36:18.010]  Donald Trump is a Russian asset.
[02:36:18.309 --> 02:36:19.069]  He is.
[02:36:19.629 --> 02:36:23.829]  And if you don't believe that, it doesn't make it less true.
[02:36:24.229 --> 02:36:35.809]  If you are a low information voter and you don't understand what I'm saying by that, it doesn't make it less true just because you don't know information or understand.
[02:36:36.829 --> 02:36:39.709]  You can go, there ain't no Russian collusion.
[02:36:40.090 --> 02:36:41.909]  Hey, America, patriot.
[02:36:43.100 --> 02:36:46.739]  You being stupid doesn't make it...
[02:36:46.739 --> 02:36:47.459]  Alright, pause again.
[02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:53.200]  This is the guy that just held his fingers out about three inches apart.
[02:36:53.379 --> 02:36:59.319]  It's actually about a two inch long cartridge that just said this is what hit Trump in the ear.
[02:37:04.090 --> 02:37:04.649]  No.
[02:37:05.350 --> 02:37:08.709]  Something this big going straight.
[02:37:09.709 --> 02:37:13.909]  So look on how big that is coming straight at you.
[02:37:14.090 --> 02:37:15.309]  Went like this.
[02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:19.590]  Like you ever been in a car wreck and the person just barely scratches you?
[02:37:20.610 --> 02:37:21.170]  Dumbass.
[02:37:21.889 --> 02:37:30.649]  Aren't most car wrecks like you come out of the grocery store and somebody's pulled out and barely scratched your car?
[02:37:31.770 --> 02:37:34.989]  You understand that happens most of the time.
[02:37:35.709 --> 02:37:36.530]  Thank God.
[02:37:37.069 --> 02:37:43.930]  So you understand an automobile, or maybe you have a mailbox out by your house, and somebody just barely grazes it.
[02:37:45.989 --> 02:37:53.010]  Maybe you've been cutting tomatoes, and you've barely missed and just barely nicked yourself.
[02:37:53.209 --> 02:37:57.309]  It's a nick, it's a graze, you dumb son of a bitch.
[02:37:57.450 --> 02:37:59.370]  But he's not a dumb son of a bitch.
[02:37:59.870 --> 02:38:01.309]  He's a fucking liar.
[02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:06.040]  He was not hit by this.
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:08.500]  You don't throw bullets at people.
[02:38:10.719 --> 02:38:11.879]  There's the camera right there.
[02:38:12.559 --> 02:38:13.899]  Didn't come at you like this.
[02:38:23.459 --> 02:38:29.020]  But did you hear the most important part?
[02:38:30.430 --> 02:38:34.309]  I count on people in the government that know to deal with him.
[02:38:34.469 --> 02:38:38.389]  Oh, like the CIA said on CNN, Mudd, we're going to kill this guy.
[02:38:39.530 --> 02:38:42.690]  Oh, but nobody tried to kill him the other two times.
[02:38:42.969 --> 02:38:47.129]  You're just calling for them to deal with him and us.
[02:38:47.290 --> 02:38:48.590]  Oh, okay.
[02:38:49.409 --> 02:38:51.270]  Everything he says, he just discredits.
[02:38:51.389 --> 02:38:52.209]  And he's reading off the script.
[02:38:52.430 --> 02:38:53.290]  They're all over the place.
[02:38:53.450 --> 02:38:54.909]  We're going to deal with these Russians.
[02:38:55.149 --> 02:38:56.809]  We're going to roll up our sleeves.
[02:38:57.770 --> 02:38:58.750]  Do we got it?
[02:39:00.650 --> 02:39:02.889]  Damn Russian, you son of a...
[02:39:02.889 --> 02:39:04.790]  We love America.
[02:39:05.049 --> 02:39:05.870]  What did Bruce Springsteen say?
[02:39:06.010 --> 02:39:07.809]  Trump doesn't know anything about America.
[02:39:07.989 --> 02:39:08.989]  He's anti-American.
[02:39:10.430 --> 02:39:13.590]  They're the ones that hate America and are taking out all our founding father statues.
[02:39:13.829 --> 02:39:14.530]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:39:14.629 --> 02:39:15.670]  They hate America.
[02:39:15.870 --> 02:39:16.629]  It's not us.
[02:39:16.770 --> 02:39:18.290]  And any idiot knows that.
[02:39:18.549 --> 02:39:21.430]  They all read off scripts because they're all puppets.
[02:39:21.549 --> 02:39:22.770]  They're not real men and women.
[02:39:22.930 --> 02:39:23.690]  They're jokes.
[02:39:24.229 --> 02:39:27.649]  I can talk 50 hours without any notes because I'm real.
[02:39:28.250 --> 02:39:29.209]  So can you.
[02:39:31.569 --> 02:39:38.110]  I think I go to some barber shop and drink coffee with black good old boys, Hispanic good old boys, black good old boys.
[02:39:38.270 --> 02:39:40.209]  You think we're all reading off teleprompters?
[02:39:40.270 --> 02:39:41.829]  You think we need a teleprompter to talk?
[02:39:41.950 --> 02:39:44.209]  We don't need anything to talk because we've been doing our research.
[02:39:44.209 --> 02:39:45.409]  We know what we're talking about.
[02:39:45.850 --> 02:39:47.629]  We've been around the block a couple times.
[02:39:47.670 --> 02:39:50.870]  And we know BS when we see it and we're done with it.
[02:39:51.790 --> 02:39:54.530]  And that wasn't World War III. It doesn't mean you're a Russian agent.
[02:39:55.110 --> 02:39:56.149]  You rat bitch.
[02:39:59.270 --> 02:40:00.629]  Oh, but we're coming to get them.
[02:40:00.790 --> 02:40:01.569]  But they're coming to...
[02:40:01.569 --> 02:40:03.030]  They're like, we need to deal with them.
[02:40:03.049 --> 02:40:03.790]  You know what I mean?
[02:40:04.909 --> 02:40:06.329]  Because nobody tried to kill Trump.
[02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:07.149]  We need to deal with them.
[02:40:07.370 --> 02:40:08.069]  There's people in the government.
[02:40:08.510 --> 02:40:12.750]  You ain't gonna do anything, are you, punk?
[02:40:17.229 --> 02:40:18.170]  Feeling lucky, punk?
[02:40:20.969 --> 02:40:21.450]  Go ahead.
[02:40:25.729 --> 02:40:26.049]  So...
[02:40:26.049 --> 02:40:27.969]  Finish up.
[02:40:29.950 --> 02:40:34.090]  You being stupid doesn't make it not true.
[02:40:34.649 --> 02:40:36.170]  He's a Russian asset.
[02:40:37.069 --> 02:40:41.389]  He hired a Russian agent to run his 2016 campaign.
[02:40:42.329 --> 02:40:49.610]  One of the things the guy went to jail for was for being a Russian agent and not registering as a Russian agent.
[02:40:49.610 --> 02:40:51.389]  That was one of his charges.
[02:40:52.899 --> 02:41:03.639]  His job right before working for Trump was to work for a pro-Russia Ukrainian candidate who got run out of the Ukraine for being a Russian and fled to Russia.
[02:41:05.219 --> 02:41:11.680]  When Paul Manafort came to work for Trump, he owed Oleg Deripaska $60 million.
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:15.020]  But he came to work for Donald Trump for free.
[02:41:18.350 --> 02:41:22.110]  I mean, I can list 10 other connections to Russia.
[02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:36.469]  But I mean, Elon Musk, with his Starlink satellite internet, Russia said, hey, we want you to shut it off over Ukraine so they can't use it, but we can use it to attack them.
[02:41:36.530 --> 02:41:36.989]  And he did.
[02:41:37.790 --> 02:41:39.729]  And he did the same thing for China.
[02:41:41.049 --> 02:41:41.629]  Not true.
[02:41:41.709 --> 02:41:42.690]  Their situation with Taiwan.
[02:41:45.149 --> 02:41:48.469]  They're both having regular conversations with Russia.
[02:41:48.729 --> 02:41:50.329]  These guys are Russian assets.
[02:41:51.430 --> 02:41:59.670]  This whole thing, this whole Trump thing, going back a long time, this is all Russia.
[02:42:00.110 --> 02:42:01.149]  Every bit of it.
[02:42:01.290 --> 02:42:03.430]  And if you're supporting it, you're a fucking idiot.
[02:42:04.170 --> 02:42:06.229]  You're one of the dumbest people in American history.
[02:42:06.489 --> 02:42:08.450]  You're an unwitting Russian pawn.
[02:42:08.829 --> 02:42:17.530]  And even though I'm telling you this to your face, and you have a supercomputer in your pocket that you could go research it with, you won't because you're that fucking stupid.
[02:42:18.610 --> 02:42:23.329]  You'd rather double down on your mistake than admit how fucking stupid you are.
[02:42:23.450 --> 02:42:24.069]  And that's a shame.
[02:42:24.290 --> 02:42:24.770]  That's pitiful.
[02:42:25.010 --> 02:42:26.030]  You're not a patriot.
[02:42:26.250 --> 02:42:26.989]  You're a fucking idiot.
[02:42:27.989 --> 02:42:30.469]  Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan.
[02:42:31.990 --> 02:42:45.770]  George Herbert Walker Bush, George W. Bush, he worked for presidential candidates and campaigns all over the world, and what he's good at is getting people registered to vote and delegates and all the rest of it.
[02:42:45.850 --> 02:43:01.639]  He's a delegate expert at the election nomination level, and Elon Musk has a policy that you do not use His satellites for military operations,
[02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:07.040]  and when Ukraine was using them to blow up Russian ships in the Black Sea, he turned them off.
[02:43:08.680 --> 02:43:15.680]  There's only one country gets to use Elon Musk satellites for weapons, and that's the United States.
[02:43:16.620 --> 02:43:17.659]  And that's a fact.
[02:43:17.700 --> 02:43:18.340]  You can go look it up.
[02:43:18.440 --> 02:43:20.020]  He gets the contracts from the Pentagon.
[02:43:22.340 --> 02:43:23.659]  And the Pentagon...
[02:43:26.450 --> 02:43:32.950]  It's on record that Elon Musk called and couldn't get a hold of Biden when he had the Russians calling him.
[02:43:33.549 --> 02:43:35.610]  Remember, Kennedy's always on the phone with the Russian leaders.
[02:43:36.209 --> 02:43:37.909]  The Biden administration wouldn't talk to him.
[02:43:37.989 --> 02:43:41.829]  So the Russians start threatening to launch major attacks on U.S. sites.
[02:43:42.909 --> 02:43:44.190]  This all came out in the news.
[02:43:44.670 --> 02:43:47.090]  So Elon Musk at 2 a.m.
[02:43:47.209 --> 02:43:54.690]  gets on the phone and gets the Secretary of Defense on the phone and gets the Russians on the phone with him.
[02:43:55.579 --> 02:43:57.000]  And says, what do you want me to do?
[02:43:57.959 --> 02:43:59.639]  And the Pentagon said, turn them off.
[02:44:00.719 --> 02:44:09.540]  Just like at that time, at the start of the war, or in the middle of it, it was the first third, kind of the beginning of the second quarter, I would say.
[02:44:10.940 --> 02:44:12.799]  Let's say now's the end, which it's not, but you know what I mean.
[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:14.120]  It was about a third end.
[02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:16.360]  And anybody can look this up.
[02:44:16.739 --> 02:44:17.659]  So let's get into facts.
[02:44:17.739 --> 02:44:19.719]  This guy just uses these rumors and disinformation.
[02:44:20.459 --> 02:44:20.739]  Ahem.
[02:44:23.690 --> 02:44:26.549]  That's when Biden was, we can't give him Abrams tanks and F-16s.
[02:44:26.610 --> 02:44:27.110]  That escalates.
[02:44:27.229 --> 02:44:29.549]  That's World War III. And we can't give him long-range missiles.
[02:44:29.690 --> 02:44:30.170]  Now they do.
[02:44:33.069 --> 02:44:38.049]  And so, Elon Musk tried to call the White House, and then he called the Pentagon, and they agreed.
[02:44:38.389 --> 02:44:44.209]  And even the New York Times later, they say, well, actually, Musk was at the direction of the Pentagon, because that's who pays him.
[02:44:44.829 --> 02:44:46.610]  And he's like, hey, these aren't supposed to.
[02:44:46.670 --> 02:44:48.110]  You said these wouldn't be used over there.
[02:44:49.129 --> 02:44:51.049]  And the Pentagon said, yeah, turn them off.
[02:44:55.350 --> 02:45:00.870]  But then that guy just gets up there and calls Elon Musk a Russian agent.
[02:45:01.549 --> 02:45:05.049]  Elon Musk is operating in almost every country in the world.
[02:45:09.350 --> 02:45:16.250]  And in the past, he wouldn't have to call because the Russians would call the Pentagon or the Russians would call Biden.
[02:45:16.469 --> 02:45:21.870]  But I can play you a clip of Biden six months ago saying he hasn't talked to Putin in almost three years.
[02:45:22.090 --> 02:45:22.649]  Why?
[02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:28.430]  Kennedy used to talk to Khrushchev every couple of days.
[02:45:29.110 --> 02:45:30.930]  LBJ, Ronald Reagan.
[02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:35.170]  They all talk to the foreign leaders all the time.
[02:45:35.450 --> 02:45:36.549]  That's what you do.
[02:45:39.090 --> 02:45:40.069]  Good Lord.
[02:45:40.670 --> 02:45:42.430]  Oh, he's a North Korean agent.
[02:45:42.530 --> 02:45:43.329]  He talked to him.
[02:45:43.729 --> 02:45:46.030]  Oh, he talked to the Mexican president.
[02:45:46.030 --> 02:45:47.069]  He's a Mexican agent.
[02:45:53.270 --> 02:45:54.489]  All right, I'm out of time.
[02:45:56.909 --> 02:45:58.829]  I cannot continue this fight without you.
[02:45:58.930 --> 02:46:01.270]  We have smoking badass products that you need.
[02:46:01.430 --> 02:46:06.229]  And our two sponsors, thealexjonesstore.com and my dad's company, drjonesnatchles.com.

[02:46:10.709 --> 02:46:16.489]  And they just got two new ones in, Corsetin Max and CoQ10 Pro.
[02:46:16.709 --> 02:46:19.649]  Now, I don't need to tell you about CoQ10 or Corsetin.
[02:46:20.409 --> 02:46:21.409]  They boost your whole body.
[02:46:21.530 --> 02:46:23.149]  They're antiviral, antibacterial.
[02:46:23.250 --> 02:46:24.209]  They're great for your heart, your brain.

[02:46:26.149 --> 02:46:27.110]  I'm on it all the time.
[02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:32.569]  And I said, why am I taking a store-bought Corsuchin and CoQ10?
[02:46:32.569 --> 02:46:34.290]  I said to my dad, you got to put one out.
[02:46:34.590 --> 02:46:36.049]  Here's the top manufacturers.
[02:46:36.950 --> 02:46:37.670]  They got it.
[02:46:37.729 --> 02:46:38.309]  They got it in.
[02:46:39.489 --> 02:46:41.930]  Competitors sell this exact same thing from the top lab.
[02:46:41.930 --> 02:46:44.370]  We actually get it from a big pharma company, the Patriots.
[02:46:44.510 --> 02:46:46.170]  It's not one of the biggest, but it's big pharma.
[02:46:46.209 --> 02:46:46.629]  They make...
[02:46:47.840 --> 02:46:50.180]  And this is stuff sold in stores everywhere for $60 a bottle.
[02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:52.399]  It's 40% off right now.
[02:46:52.860 --> 02:46:54.600]  $29.95 for both of them.
[02:46:55.629 --> 02:46:56.629]  They're 40% off.
[02:46:56.790 --> 02:46:57.610]  You need them.
[02:46:57.709 --> 02:46:58.250]  You need to take them.

[02:47:17.549 --> 02:47:18.610]  Energy production.

[02:47:32.190 --> 02:47:32.850]  Rocket rest.
[02:47:32.969 --> 02:47:33.870]  The great herbal sleep aid.
[02:47:34.090 --> 02:47:35.069]  That's really good for you.

[02:47:50.730 --> 02:47:52.049]  At drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:47:52.149 --> 02:47:53.790]  And we can be shut down next Wednesday.
[02:47:53.989 --> 02:47:55.790]  So these sponsors are going to help us stay on the air.
[02:47:55.930 --> 02:47:57.329]  And that takes money to do.
[02:47:57.510 --> 02:47:58.450]  I need your support.
[02:47:58.610 --> 02:47:59.270]  You need these products.
[02:47:59.450 --> 02:47:59.889]  It's a win-win.
[02:48:00.049 --> 02:48:00.829]  Take action now.
[02:48:02.329 --> 02:48:03.229]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:48:03.969 --> 02:48:08.389]  And then, something really cool at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:48:08.389 --> 02:48:09.909]  Not just all the new Trump One gear.

[02:48:20.510 --> 02:48:22.209]  If you really want to support us, those are the things to get.
[02:48:22.290 --> 02:48:23.170]  They've got big markup in them.
[02:48:23.229 --> 02:48:25.309]  Most stuff doesn't have a bunch of markups, so we've got to sell a lot.
[02:48:25.430 --> 02:48:27.930]  If you really want to support us, those are mementos, limited edition.
[02:48:28.010 --> 02:48:28.870]  Get the posters.
[02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:37.020]  But Chase noticed about a year ago that nobody could find my 2000 to 2008 broadcast.
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:40.600]  He found an archive somewhere, digitized it all.
[02:48:41.100 --> 02:48:45.260]  So anybody that's a VIP member for $30 a month, you get $40 to spend each month.
[02:48:45.260 --> 02:48:48.420]  So if you're going to buy anything there, you should be a VIP member because you make money that way.
[02:48:48.559 --> 02:48:50.420]  It reminds you to be a member, cancel any time.
[02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:52.579]  It reminds you that you're there and have that money to spend.

[02:49:11.420 --> 02:49:14.840]  Chase loves the old shows, so do I. And that's a fundraiser as well.
[02:49:15.100 --> 02:49:16.540]  The Lost Alex Jones tapes.
[02:49:17.840 --> 02:49:20.659]  Free for everybody that's a VIP member, or for other folks.
[02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:22.540]  It's 30-something bucks, $37.
[02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:24.059]  You get $17.76 off.
[02:49:25.459 --> 02:49:26.280]  And it's digital.
[02:49:26.500 --> 02:49:34.100]  You just pay, and then it sends you an email with a link to down throw the MP3, and then you can share it, upload it, however you want, and these things are viral.
[02:49:34.239 --> 02:49:40.680]  And we need you to get it, and then go mine through it, and upload the stuff to X, because some of the clips already coming off of it are getting 5, 10 million, 3 million views.
[02:49:41.079 --> 02:49:42.000]  So very exciting.
[02:49:42.139 --> 02:49:47.040]  The Lost Alex Jones Tapes at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:49:47.659 --> 02:49:48.920]  All right, great job, the crew.
[02:49:50.110 --> 02:49:51.409]  I got to most of it.
[02:49:51.489 --> 02:49:52.430]  We did a pretty good job today.
[02:49:52.750 --> 02:49:54.969]  I'll be back 4 to 8 p.m.
[02:49:55.030 --> 02:49:56.790]  tomorrow night with Chase Geiser Co-hosting.
[02:49:57.870 --> 02:49:58.889]  Infowars.com.
[02:50:00.030 --> 02:50:02.790]  And we could be shut down as early as Wednesday night.
[02:50:02.950 --> 02:50:04.049]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:50:04.270 --> 02:50:05.450]  We're up for sale, for sale.
[02:50:06.370 --> 02:50:06.770]  Whatever.
[02:50:06.930 --> 02:50:07.610]  We're going to continue on.
[02:50:07.649 --> 02:50:08.690]  But what a historic moment.
[02:50:08.850 --> 02:50:10.870]  And God kept his honor until this time regardless.
[02:50:11.290 --> 02:50:13.829]  So God's hand is on all of this.
[02:50:14.430 --> 02:50:19.090]  I want to go ahead and end the transmission with a couple of special reports I shot last night.
[02:50:22.779 --> 02:50:24.319]  And these are important.
[02:50:26.020 --> 02:50:28.399]  Let's do clip one.
[02:50:28.620 --> 02:50:29.500]  Election bombshell.
[02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:33.719]  Democrat leaders still planning to block certification of Trump re-election.
[02:50:36.860 --> 02:50:38.620]  And then let's play...
[02:50:38.620 --> 02:50:46.379]  Trump makes a historic announcement.
[02:50:46.819 --> 02:50:52.590]  I don't have time to play the others, but you can find them all on X. And boy, let me tell you, I love doing these reports at night.
[02:50:54.030 --> 02:50:57.829]  These babies last night, as of this morning, had 20 million views together.
[02:50:58.430 --> 02:51:00.350]  I shot six reports last night.
[02:51:01.469 --> 02:51:03.309]  And then Rob Deuce stayed up here late and got them out.
[02:51:03.610 --> 02:51:04.829]  And I've been doing that all the time.
[02:51:04.930 --> 02:51:05.909]  Because they want to shut me down?
[02:51:05.909 --> 02:51:09.149]  I promise them I will only increase the output.
[02:51:10.290 --> 02:51:11.190]  Because I'm in a fight.
[02:51:11.610 --> 02:51:12.809]  I'm a really friendly guy.
[02:51:12.850 --> 02:51:16.069]  Until you come up and knock me up the side of the head, you don't like it.
[02:51:16.350 --> 02:51:17.889]  And you might be super badass.
[02:51:18.450 --> 02:51:19.930]  You might kick my ass.
[02:51:21.239 --> 02:51:29.520]  But you're going to be fighting somebody that is going to absolutely give you 100%, and you're not going to like it.
[02:51:29.780 --> 02:51:33.260]  And that's how I am in a physical fight, and that's how I am in information war.
[02:51:34.360 --> 02:51:35.920]  That's what I always tell the bad guys.
[02:51:38.610 --> 02:51:40.989]  You thought because we were asleep, we were pussies.
[02:51:41.569 --> 02:51:42.790]  America was asleep.
[02:51:43.030 --> 02:51:46.250]  You thought your intimidation was what was keeping people under your control.
[02:51:46.430 --> 02:51:52.670]  We're awake now, and the more you piss on us and punch us on the nose and attack us, the more we fight back.
[02:51:52.670 --> 02:51:56.590]  So you just keep doing what you're doing and see how that works out for you.
[02:51:57.610 --> 02:51:59.090]  Really appreciate the crew and their support.
[02:51:59.090 --> 02:52:00.110]  They are the best.
[02:52:00.329 --> 02:52:02.989]  And when you get the products there of the sites, that will...
[02:52:02.989 --> 02:52:04.469]  Because right now, I'll be quite honest with you.
[02:52:11.379 --> 02:52:18.780]  With all the bills and things we've gotten, I had an accountant break it down last Monday, and we've got a little bit more money in since then, but money goes out the door quick.
[02:52:19.340 --> 02:52:24.799]  We got about a month of operating stuff if we get shut down next week with a new operation.
[02:52:26.979 --> 02:52:29.459]  And I want to be able to hire the whole crew.
[02:52:30.100 --> 02:52:32.860]  And I got to finish another studio that's getting done by our sponsor.
[02:52:33.940 --> 02:52:34.299]  So...
[02:52:36.030 --> 02:52:37.250]  We're a critical operation.
[02:52:37.530 --> 02:52:38.930]  Go get the vitamins you need them.
[02:52:39.010 --> 02:52:39.750]  Go get the shirts.
[02:52:39.909 --> 02:52:40.989]  Go get the Devastator Knife.
[02:52:41.010 --> 02:52:41.989]  How freaking cool is that?
[02:52:42.090 --> 02:52:43.530]  Get the fundraiser posters.
[02:52:43.690 --> 02:52:44.069]  Come on.
[02:52:45.510 --> 02:52:47.950]  I mean, you're not betting on a horse that loses here.
[02:52:48.729 --> 02:52:50.909]  This is a participation sport.
[02:52:51.090 --> 02:52:52.950]  The info war taking the country and the world back.
[02:52:53.469 --> 02:52:54.149]  1776 worldwide.
[02:52:55.250 --> 02:52:56.309]  God put me in this position.
[02:52:56.309 --> 02:52:57.649]  It's the opposite of a power trip.
[02:52:57.790 --> 02:52:58.709]  It's an incredible responsibility.
[02:52:58.870 --> 02:52:59.629]  That's why it works so hard.
[02:52:59.770 --> 02:53:02.090]  But we're the detonator.
[02:53:02.549 --> 02:53:04.010]  It's like I showed you that cartridge.
[02:53:04.270 --> 02:53:10.030]  The little cap is what detonates the larger charge that fires the bullet down the barrel.
[02:53:10.909 --> 02:53:19.790]  InfoWars was the detonator, is the detonator, and I thank you all because by supporting us, you are the detonator, the genesis point.
[02:53:21.110 --> 02:53:22.770]  And that's something, isn't it?
[02:53:24.159 --> 02:53:26.479]  We are crashing the lies and disinformation.
[02:53:26.860 --> 02:53:28.440]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[02:53:28.940 --> 02:53:30.879]  We are the resistance.
[02:53:32.739 --> 02:53:34.520]  Donald Trump is not inaugurated.
[02:53:34.719 --> 02:53:35.500]  He's not in office.
[02:53:35.500 --> 02:53:41.059]  Just because he won the quote-unquote election, there's a long list of things to go.
[02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:44.540]  And I'll tell you what sets off my spidey senses about all of this.
[02:53:44.639 --> 02:53:47.280]  They are all acting fairly reasonable.
[02:53:47.500 --> 02:53:49.379]  And it's for one of two reasons.
[02:53:49.739 --> 02:53:57.780]  One, they are either terrified and they know they're fucking caught and they know that they've got to step in line or that's their only chance to not get held accountable.
[02:53:58.120 --> 02:54:02.020]  Or two, they have a backup plan to do something terrible to Trump.
[02:54:02.159 --> 02:54:04.639]  Now remember, these people fucking tried to kill Trump.
[02:54:04.799 --> 02:54:10.399]  The fact that they're calling him and saying, hey, you know, let's do this civil and shit, that's so out of character for them.
[02:54:10.479 --> 02:54:11.940]  It makes me think they have another plan.
[02:54:13.569 --> 02:54:24.909]  Now, I've been sent the clip you just saw from a popular podcast that came out yesterday probably 200 times on my text message, email, and I had callers calling about it.
[02:54:24.950 --> 02:54:25.649]  People saying, is this true?
[02:54:25.709 --> 02:54:26.069]  Is this true?
[02:54:26.450 --> 02:54:34.809]  And yes, what the man is saying, what his hunch is from their past behavior is dead on, but I don't need to go off the hunch.
[02:54:36.729 --> 02:54:52.309]  Raskin and Carville and all these other top globalist strategists, the Democrats, have said they wouldn't accept a Trump win and that they would try to decertify it and that they would have the electors not certify it coming up on January 6th.
[02:54:52.389 --> 02:54:54.989]  Everything they blamed Trump for and they said was illegal.
[02:54:55.780 --> 02:55:01.159]  And they're gonna try to cook up some claim again that Trump's connected January 6th.
[02:55:01.280 --> 02:55:02.860]  So he's an insurrectionist.
[02:55:02.940 --> 02:55:04.719]  So the Constitution says he can't be president.
[02:55:05.239 --> 02:55:07.719]  Yeah, but you've got to be convicted of that.
[02:55:07.860 --> 02:55:09.840]  He's not even been charged with it.
[02:55:09.959 --> 02:55:11.440]  So this is not a rumor.
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:24.280]  And there's a famous clip from a few months ago of Jamie Raskin, who is one of their top strategists, a congressman, saying that they would not certify and that it would go to civil war conditions.
[02:55:24.700 --> 02:55:34.520]  They wanna kick it to Congress, so it's gonna be up to us on January 6th, 2025, to tell the rampaging Trump mobs that he's disqualified.
[02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:47.969]  And then we need Bodyguards for everybody in civil war conditions, all because the nine justices, not all of them, but these justices who have not many cases to look at every year, not that much work to do.
[02:55:48.409 --> 02:55:54.090]  A huge staff, great protection, simply do not want to do their job.
[02:55:54.229 --> 02:55:59.250]  But now there's more quotes of him in publications making similar statements.
[02:55:59.590 --> 02:56:01.649]  Let folks cast their votes for Trump.
[02:56:02.299 --> 02:56:03.299]  If that's their choice.
[02:56:03.579 --> 02:56:06.500]  But mark my words, we won't be certified in the election.
[02:56:06.500 --> 02:56:11.100]  He might win, but we'll ensure he doesn't step foot in the Oval Office.
[02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:14.860]  And there's more quotes of these people saying it.
[02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:17.479]  So it's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:56:17.680 --> 02:56:18.979]  It's not a hunch.
[02:56:20.260 --> 02:56:24.100]  Maddow is on TV a few days ago saying, Trump's gonna kill everybody.
[02:56:24.100 --> 02:56:25.260]  He's gonna have martial law.
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:26.920]  The military's coming for you.
[02:56:27.420 --> 02:56:31.180]  Hell, Harris and Biden were saying that in the last few weeks over and over again with no evidence.
[02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:45.579]  And so they've gotta have the military rise up and they've gotta get aggressive and be like pirates and do all this aggressive violent stuff or we're going to attack them because we're destroying democracy by getting our candidate elected?
[02:56:46.590 --> 02:56:52.870]  So, they need some pretext to launch this civil unrest they want.
[02:56:53.129 --> 02:56:56.569]  And the only question is, will it be before he gets inaugurated or after?
[02:56:57.389 --> 02:56:59.909]  Regardless, they're pushing this, they're setting it up.
[02:57:00.030 --> 02:57:07.090]  But I wanna show you something that I've been pointing out for a while, that Joe Rogan pointed out today, that is really blowing people away.
[02:57:07.309 --> 02:57:08.510]  Look at these numbers.
[02:57:08.879 --> 02:57:11.920]  U.S. presidential election, popular vote, Democrats versus Republicans.
[02:57:12.180 --> 02:57:15.520]  And this is the first time Trump has won the popular vote.
[02:57:15.739 --> 02:57:17.860]  So look at 2016.
[02:57:18.940 --> 02:57:30.620]  I mean, do you really believe that this is what Hillary got, and this is what Trump got, and that now suddenly Biden comes in and he gets all of this?
[02:57:30.739 --> 02:57:32.760]  What's that, 17 million more votes?
[02:57:34.059 --> 02:57:36.739]  And way more than Barack Obama ever got?
[02:57:37.079 --> 02:57:39.239]  No, that's the Big Ten election fraud.
[02:57:39.639 --> 02:57:45.719]  But the Republicans had no ground game and lawyers and poll watchers at that time.
[02:57:46.059 --> 02:57:47.479]  And so it just sailed through.
[02:57:47.659 --> 02:57:49.399]  This time, there was still some fraud.
[02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:50.819]  They got a call over the country doing it.
[02:57:51.750 --> 02:57:55.450]  But it wasn't enough, so Trump won the popular vote.
[02:57:55.750 --> 02:58:02.950]  Do you really believe that Kamala Harris got this fewer votes, even though she is super unpopular, than Joe Biden?
[02:58:03.030 --> 02:58:03.250]  No.
[02:58:03.469 --> 02:58:06.670]  That right there shows you the massive fraud.
[02:58:06.870 --> 02:58:08.590]  No one is buying this, it's in your face.
[02:58:08.750 --> 02:58:13.069]  Then we've got all the proof, and the proof this time, but most of it got mitigated.
[02:58:13.329 --> 02:58:21.709]  Illegals voting all over, mail-in ballots with fake signatures, but most of it did Get discovered and they got caught.
[02:58:21.930 --> 02:58:23.729]  And that's why they're so scared.
[02:58:23.989 --> 02:58:27.770]  Back when we were naive and people weren't engaged and watching, they could get away with anything.
[02:58:28.250 --> 02:58:33.430]  But now they've got a major, major problem because humanity is awake.
[02:58:33.569 --> 02:58:34.889]  We were asleep before.
[02:58:35.190 --> 02:58:37.129]  And so mark my words.
[02:58:38.559 --> 02:58:40.260]  They know they've committed massive crimes.
[02:58:40.459 --> 02:58:41.719]  They know they've looted the treasury.
[02:58:42.079 --> 02:58:44.920]  They smuggled in all these kids and other people in human trafficking.
[02:58:45.479 --> 02:58:47.780]  I mean, they just went for broke like they were invincible.
[02:58:48.440 --> 02:58:55.500]  And they are not going to just go away and let us restore our republic without a fight.
[02:58:56.000 --> 02:59:01.500]  And they've been telling us- That they're not gonna go away without a fight.
[02:59:01.659 --> 02:59:06.520]  Sure, they had Harris and Walls claim that, but that's just the cover story.
[02:59:06.600 --> 02:59:14.979]  Just like what Obama said, peaceful transfer, but had the CIA illegally spying on Trump and had a plan to undermine him, frame him as a Russian agent and remove him.
[02:59:15.120 --> 02:59:15.959]  But that failed.
[02:59:16.459 --> 02:59:18.379]  So when that failed, they stole the 2020 election.
[02:59:18.600 --> 02:59:25.659]  They tried to steal this one, but because we've had four years to organize and get ready, and their policies were so horrible, America rebelled, and they're in deep trouble.
[02:59:25.879 --> 02:59:30.219]  Here are the actual numbers, if you go back over this, back to 2004 until now.
[02:59:30.760 --> 02:59:32.459]  Kerry, 59 million, popular vote.
[02:59:32.559 --> 02:59:34.319]  Obama, 69.5.
[02:59:34.639 --> 02:59:36.420]  Obama, again, 65.9.
[02:59:36.680 --> 02:59:38.159]  Clinton, 65.9.
[02:59:38.659 --> 02:59:40.340]  Biden, 81.3.
[02:59:40.620 --> 02:59:42.440]  Harris, 66.9.
[02:59:42.600 --> 02:59:43.180]  Point four.
[02:59:43.600 --> 02:59:46.059]  Now, does anybody believe that?
[02:59:46.180 --> 02:59:46.319]  No.
[02:59:46.600 --> 02:59:53.860]  This is when they really went completely wild with the fraud, and everybody can see through it.
[02:59:54.219 --> 02:59:57.979]  Now, the real fights now, the next 72 days trying to get Trump in.
[02:59:58.940 --> 03:00:00.360]  We want a big battle, but not the war.
[03:00:00.500 --> 03:00:07.479]  And that's why it's essential that we all stay frosty focused and we continue to stay informed so we can inform and educate others.
[03:00:07.479 --> 03:00:08.700]  We are the Paul Revere's.
[03:00:08.780 --> 03:00:09.540]  We are the resistance.
[03:00:09.860 --> 03:00:14.479]  We are the underdogs, but we're gaining ground, removing the globalist.
[03:00:14.659 --> 03:00:30.129]  That's why it's so critical when InfoWars could potentially be shut down next Wednesday, it's up for sale and bankruptcy, that if we do get shut down, you follow me at X. At Real Alex Jones and the backup channel at AJN Live for Alex Jones Network, AJN Live,
[03:00:30.370 --> 03:00:38.889]  where we are ready to relaunch and ready to continue in the face of this tyranny because the work we do is so critical and your work spreading the word is so critical.
[03:00:39.129 --> 03:00:45.909]  So I thank you so much for your support and just want to congratulate everybody for forcing this evil out in the open.
[03:00:46.149 --> 03:00:51.110]  We haven't won the war, but we've turned the tide, we have the initiative, and we're winning major battles.
[03:01:00.799 --> 03:01:06.000]  I am taping this announcement on the evening of Friday, November 8, 2024.
[03:01:07.329 --> 03:01:12.370]  In just three or four days, Infowars could potentially be shut down forever.
[03:01:12.750 --> 03:01:21.870]  We are up for forced sale by the federal bankruptcy court on Wednesday, November 13th, and the bad guys have pledged to buy it and shut us down.
[03:01:22.170 --> 03:01:31.329]  But regardless, we're gonna fight on at Real Alex Jones on X and at the AJN Network for Alex Jones Network.
[03:01:31.590 --> 03:01:43.700]  We've got backup studios, we've got the crew, But we need your word of mouth if they shut down Infowars to let all the people that are confused and don't know where the website is or the main show to find us.
[03:01:44.040 --> 03:01:45.860]  I hope some good guys buy it.
[03:01:46.040 --> 03:01:52.319]  There's some good people that claim they are, but the system's so rigged, who knows if they'll even be allowed to make the bid.
[03:01:53.129 --> 03:01:54.889]  So I'm not gonna count on that.
[03:01:55.450 --> 03:02:02.510]  Just please pay attention to this, because this is all part and parcel of the climate of the censorship and the tearing in this country.
[03:02:02.750 --> 03:02:07.409]  And that's why we overrode their election fraud and their censorship and their bullying and put Trump in.
[03:02:07.569 --> 03:02:08.469]  So I'm very optimistic.
[03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:16.059]  But at the same time, we are still fighting for our right to be able to have access to the public and warning about what's happening.
[03:02:16.260 --> 03:02:17.799]  So thanks for all your past support.
[03:02:18.020 --> 03:02:19.340]  Now I need your word of mouth.
[03:02:19.559 --> 03:02:26.379]  Let folks know about the situation and be sure and pay attention to what's happening at Real Alex Jones, especially coming up this Wednesday.
[03:02:28.940 --> 03:02:30.639]  Now is the time to wear Trump gear.
[03:02:31.040 --> 03:02:33.780]  And we've got the best designs at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:02:33.940 --> 03:02:36.120]  You support the Second American Revolution.
[03:02:36.420 --> 03:02:37.899]  You exercise your free speech.
[03:02:38.120 --> 03:02:39.840]  You stand up to the bullies.
[03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:44.180]  You exercise your will.
[03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:50.299]  And it keeps this broadcast, and we're shut down next week, still on the air at the Alex Jones Network.
[03:02:51.219 --> 03:02:54.659]  It'll be on the radio, the TV, all the same stations.
[03:02:54.659 --> 03:02:55.680]  It's all set up.
[03:02:56.750 --> 03:03:04.909]  The crew, the studios, all of it, but we need more funds to ensure we're full power when we continue our assault.
[03:03:06.010 --> 03:03:10.309]  So you're literally in the information war refueling the aircraft, loading the weapons, arming them.
[03:03:10.969 --> 03:03:18.690]  And we've already got a lot of weapons loaded, but we need to be fully loaded when we take off at maximum load for maximum attack when we do our attack runs in the information war.
[03:03:19.549 --> 03:03:23.430]  So we're on the tarmac right now, making sure everything's straight here.
[03:03:24.219 --> 03:03:26.340]  You need to go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:03:27.260 --> 03:03:29.920]  Beautiful black shirt with an American eagle and gold.
[03:03:30.100 --> 03:03:30.799]  Says Trump won.
[03:03:31.200 --> 03:03:32.520]  Beautiful red hoodie.
[03:03:32.639 --> 03:03:33.920]  People are going crazy over that.
[03:03:34.340 --> 03:03:35.780]  With white, with Trump won.
[03:03:36.540 --> 03:03:38.860]  Today is your Independence Day, 1-20.
[03:03:40.659 --> 03:03:44.579]  Yeah, that's when we really have the Independence Day, when we keep them alive and it gets in there.
[03:03:45.079 --> 03:03:45.659]  That's great.
[03:03:46.239 --> 03:03:49.079]  So many new hats, all of it made right there in Arkansas.
[03:03:49.299 --> 03:03:50.280]  So you get this stuff quick.
[03:03:50.379 --> 03:03:51.239]  It's already being made right now.
[03:03:51.920 --> 03:03:53.180]  A lot of new Trump shirts and stuff.
[03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:54.040]  It'll take them weeks to get done.
[03:03:54.100 --> 03:03:54.860]  Not our sponsor.
[03:03:55.059 --> 03:03:55.819]  They're ready right now.
[03:03:55.860 --> 03:03:58.540]  So your order's in at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:03:59.559 --> 03:04:01.860]  So many amazing designs, thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:04:01.979 --> 03:04:12.979]  And when you sign up at thealexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP or just click the VIP link at the top on the right hand side that's in red, when you do that, you get $40 each month to spend in the store for $30.
[03:04:13.420 --> 03:04:21.799]  So if you're going to buy the great supplements, going to get the great Patriot gear, going to support the broadcast, you've got to be VIP. It's month-to-month, $30, canceling time.
[03:04:22.100 --> 03:04:29.479]  So if you're going to be a supporter, everyone should be a VIP. My phone has been blowing up.
[03:04:30.379 --> 03:04:32.319]  I've had the crew ask me questions about it.
[03:04:32.399 --> 03:04:34.620]  I've had family call me.
[03:04:34.760 --> 03:04:43.620]  They said, have you seen the video of President Trump coming out and pledging to dismantle the deep state and stop the globalist?
[03:04:44.139 --> 03:04:45.579]  And I'm like, yeah, let me see the video.
[03:04:45.700 --> 03:04:48.340]  And I'm like, yeah, that's from a year and a half ago when he first announced his new campaign.
[03:04:49.579 --> 03:04:56.909]  And then that made me think, Oh, well, he didn't get a lot of attention then because he wasn't on X. He was only on True Social.
[03:04:57.049 --> 03:04:58.489]  But we did play this on my show.
[03:04:58.649 --> 03:05:00.469]  We did make a big deal about it.
[03:05:00.549 --> 03:05:05.309]  But there was still almost total censorship other than people coming to our shows or going to True Social.
[03:05:05.430 --> 03:05:07.389]  So people didn't know about this.
[03:05:07.530 --> 03:05:08.889]  So what's old is now new.
[03:05:09.049 --> 03:05:12.409]  So I'll play the clip, and I've got one more point to make right after it.
[03:05:12.639 --> 03:05:17.280]  Here's my plan to dismantle the deep state and reclaim our democracy from Washington.
[03:05:17.280 --> 03:05:19.600]  Corruption once and for all.
[03:05:20.100 --> 03:05:21.260]  And corruption it is.
[03:05:21.620 --> 03:05:30.319]  First, I will immediately reissue my 2020 executive order restoring the president's authority to remove rogue bureaucrats.
[03:05:30.540 --> 03:05:33.500]  And I will wield that power very aggressively.
[03:05:34.059 --> 03:05:40.399]  Second, we will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus.
[03:05:40.420 --> 03:05:42.280]  And there are plenty of them.
[03:05:43.170 --> 03:05:59.770]  The departments and agencies that have been weaponized will be completely overhauled so that faceless bureaucrats will never again be able to target and persecute conservatives, Christians, or the left's political enemies, which they're doing now at a level that nobody can believe,
[03:06:00.049 --> 03:06:01.110]  even possible.
[03:06:02.069 --> 03:06:10.250]  Third, we will totally reform FISA courts, which are so corrupt that the judges seemingly do not care when they are lied to.
[03:06:11.079 --> 03:06:17.620]  In warrant applications, so many judges have seen so many applications that they know were wrong.
[03:06:18.250 --> 03:06:19.709]  Or at least they must have known.
[03:06:19.930 --> 03:06:21.629]  They do nothing about it.
[03:06:21.750 --> 03:06:22.510]  They're lied to.
[03:06:23.170 --> 03:06:38.510]  Fourth, to expose the hoaxes and abuses of power that have been tearing our country apart, we will establish a truth and reconciliation commission to declassify and publish all documents on deep state spying, censorship,
[03:06:38.809 --> 03:06:39.409]  and corruption.
[03:06:39.409 --> 03:06:41.090]  And there are plenty of them.
[03:06:41.690 --> 03:06:53.709]  Fifth, we will launch a major crackdown on government leakers who collude with the fake news to deliberately weave false narratives and to subvert our government and our democracy.
[03:06:54.110 --> 03:06:57.530]  When possible, we will press criminal charges.
[03:06:58.329 --> 03:07:10.090]  Sixth, we will make every inspector general's office independent and physically separated from the departments they oversee so they do not become the protectors of the deep state.
[03:07:10.770 --> 03:07:27.209]  Seventh, I will ask Congress to establish an independent auditing system to continually monitor our intelligence agencies to ensure they are not spying on our citizens or running disinformation campaigns against the American people,
[03:07:27.469 --> 03:07:33.229]  or that they are not spying on someone's campaign like they spied on my campaign.
[03:07:34.479 --> 03:07:46.120]  Eighth, we will continue the effort launched by the Trump administration to move parts of the sprawling federal bureaucracy to new locations outside the Washington swamp.
[03:07:46.459 --> 03:08:02.420]  Just as I moved the Bureau of Land Management to Colorado, as many as 100,000 government positions could be moved out, and I mean immediately, of Washington to places filled with patriots who love America.
[03:08:02.420 --> 03:08:04.200]  And they really do love America.
[03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:12.440]  Ninth, I will work to ban federal bureaucrats from taking jobs at the companies they deal with and that they regulate.
[03:08:12.719 --> 03:08:17.879]  So they deal with these companies and they regulate these companies and then they want to take jobs from these companies.
[03:08:18.340 --> 03:08:19.299]  It doesn't work that way.
[03:08:19.440 --> 03:08:27.040]  Such a public display cannot go on and it's taking place all the time like with Big Pharma.
[03:08:27.659 --> 03:08:33.020]  Finally, I will push a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of Congress.
[03:08:33.340 --> 03:08:41.879]  This is how I will shatter the deep state and restore government that is controlled by the people and for the people.
[03:08:42.120 --> 03:08:43.139]  Thank you very much.
[03:08:49.739 --> 03:08:52.100]  So I'm glad people are excited about this.
[03:08:52.340 --> 03:08:56.020]  And it's officially in his platform that he wants to do this.
[03:08:56.440 --> 03:09:04.479]  The globalists are unelected tyrants that seek to make us poor, seek to cut off our energy, seek to bring in a great reset.
[03:09:04.659 --> 03:09:05.760]  They're allied with communist China.
[03:09:06.190 --> 03:09:07.290]  They're anti-family.
[03:09:07.409 --> 03:09:09.049]  They want to set up a global digital currency.
[03:09:09.270 --> 03:09:12.229]  Social credit score, they want a financial tyranny.
[03:09:12.469 --> 03:09:20.750]  What a handful of private central banks with private owners literally rule over us with their social credit scores.
[03:09:21.270 --> 03:09:30.110]  And this reminds me of yesterday, Jerome Powell, the head of the private Federal Reserve, who doesn't like Trump and Trump doesn't like him, being asked, will you resign if Trump asks you to?
[03:09:30.149 --> 03:09:30.690]  And he said no.
[03:09:31.399 --> 03:09:32.940]  That's because it's a private corporation.
[03:09:33.299 --> 03:09:35.360]  The president can't make him resign.
[03:09:36.079 --> 03:09:43.100]  But Congress that created the private Federal Reserve and gave it a charter can revoke its charter and abolish it.
[03:09:43.319 --> 03:09:50.159]  It's also a private company that has a monopoly over the issuance of currency and credit, and Congress can break up that monopoly.
[03:09:50.379 --> 03:10:03.659]  And then separately, It is important now that this has gone so viral, finally, a year and a half after he said it, that Trump reissue this promise and fully commit to his war against the globalists.
[03:10:04.020 --> 03:10:11.579]  Regardless, freedom's on the march, we've got the initiative, we've turned the tide, we're winning major battles, but we haven't won the big war yet.
[03:10:11.700 --> 03:10:23.139]  We gotta protect Trump, get him in, get good people in his administration, and then bring the globalists to justice, secure our borders, stop World War III. And lower inflation, along with a lot more.
[03:10:23.299 --> 03:10:25.700]  And that's why it's important to keep us on the air.
[03:10:25.840 --> 03:10:27.520]  We may shut down next week, as you know.
[03:10:28.040 --> 03:10:31.159]  Regardless, be sure to follow me on X so we can stay in contact.
[03:10:31.639 --> 03:10:34.719]  I'm very optimistic because of how awake the people are.
[03:10:34.840 --> 03:10:36.340]  And I thank you for everything you've done.
[03:10:36.520 --> 03:10:38.399]  This victory belongs to all of us.
[03:10:48.270 --> 03:10:53.329]  I am taping this announcement on the evening of Friday, November 8, 2024.
[03:10:54.799 --> 03:10:59.860]  In just three or four days, Infowars could potentially be shut down forever.
[03:11:00.239 --> 03:11:09.360]  We are up for forced sale by the federal bankruptcy court on Wednesday, November 13th, and the bad guys have pledged to buy it and shut us down.
[03:11:09.639 --> 03:11:18.819]  But regardless, we're gonna fight on at Real Alex Jones on X and at the AJN Network for Alex Jones Network.
[03:11:19.059 --> 03:11:31.180]  We've got backup studios, we've got the crew, But we need your word of mouth if they shut down Infowars to let all the people that are confused and don't know where the website is or the main show to find us.
[03:11:31.520 --> 03:11:33.340]  I hope some good guys buy it.
[03:11:33.540 --> 03:11:39.780]  There's some good people that claim they are, but the system's so rigged, who knows if they'll even be allowed to make the bid.
[03:11:40.619 --> 03:11:42.379]  So I'm not gonna count on that.
[03:11:42.920 --> 03:11:50.000]  Just please pay attention to this, because this is all part and parcel of the climate of the censorship and the terror in this country.
[03:11:50.260 --> 03:11:54.899]  And that's why we overrode their election fraud and their censorship and their bullying and put Trump in.
[03:11:55.040 --> 03:11:56.139]  So I'm very optimistic.
[03:11:56.530 --> 03:12:03.549]  But at the same time, we are still fighting for our right to be able to have access to the public and warning about what's happening.
[03:12:03.969 --> 03:12:05.309]  So thanks for all your past support.
[03:12:05.510 --> 03:12:06.829]  Now I need your word of mouth.
[03:12:07.030 --> 03:12:13.850]  Let folks know about the situation and be sure and pay attention to what's happening at Real Alex Jones, especially coming up this Wednesday.
[03:12:16.420 --> 03:12:18.120]  Now is the time to wear Trump gear.
[03:12:18.299 --> 03:12:21.260]  And we've got the best designs at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:12:21.379 --> 03:12:23.600]  You support the Second American Revolution.
[03:12:23.860 --> 03:12:25.379]  You exercise your free speech.
[03:12:25.559 --> 03:12:27.319]  You stand up to the bullies.
[03:12:29.399 --> 03:12:31.659]  You exercise your will.
[03:12:32.840 --> 03:12:37.780]  And it keeps this broadcast, and we're shut down next week, still on the air at the Alex Jones Network.
[03:12:38.700 --> 03:12:42.139]  It'll be on the radio, the TV, all the same stations.
[03:12:42.139 --> 03:12:43.159]  It's all set up.
[03:12:44.229 --> 03:12:52.370]  The crew, the studios, all of it, but we need more funds to ensure we're full power when we continue our assault.
[03:12:53.489 --> 03:12:57.790]  So you're literally in the information war, refueling the aircraft, loading the weapons, arming them.
[03:12:58.450 --> 03:13:06.170]  And we've already got a lot of weapons loaded, but we need to be fully loaded when we take off at maximum load for maximum attack when we do our attack runs in the information war.
[03:13:07.030 --> 03:13:10.909]  So we're on the tarmac right now, making sure everything's straight here.
[03:13:11.709 --> 03:13:13.829]  You need to go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:13:14.370 --> 03:13:17.409]  A beautiful black shirt with an American eagle and gold.
[03:13:17.569 --> 03:13:18.290]  Says Trump won.
[03:13:18.709 --> 03:13:20.010]  Beautiful red hoodie.
[03:13:20.110 --> 03:13:21.409]  People are going crazy over that.
[03:13:21.790 --> 03:13:23.250]  With white, with Trump won.
[03:13:24.030 --> 03:13:26.350]  Today is your Independence Day, 1-20.
[03:13:27.639 --> 03:13:27.959]  25.
[03:13:28.360 --> 03:13:32.059]  Yeah, that's when we really have the Independence Day, when we keep them alive and it gets in there.
[03:13:32.559 --> 03:13:33.139]  That's great.
[03:13:33.719 --> 03:13:36.559]  So many new hats, all of it made right there in Arkansas.
[03:13:36.780 --> 03:13:37.760]  So you get this stuff quick.
[03:13:37.860 --> 03:13:38.719]  It's already being made right now.
[03:13:39.379 --> 03:13:40.459]  A lot of new Trump searches.
[03:13:40.579 --> 03:13:41.520]  It'll take them weeks to get done.
[03:13:41.600 --> 03:13:42.340]  Not our sponsor.
[03:13:42.540 --> 03:13:43.299]  They're ready right now.
[03:13:43.360 --> 03:13:46.020]  So your order's in at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:13:47.040 --> 03:13:49.340]  So many amazing designs, thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:13:49.459 --> 03:14:00.459]  And when you sign up at thealexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP or just click on the VIP link at the top on the right hand side that's in red, when you do that, you get $40 each month to spend in the store for $30.
[03:14:00.899 --> 03:14:09.280]  So if you're going to buy the great supplements, going to get the great Patriot gear, going to support the broadcast, you've got to be VIP. It's month to month, $30 cancelling time.
[03:14:09.579 --> 03:14:20.149]  So if you're going to be a supporter, everyone should be a VIP. I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's going to save this country and nothing's going to stop it.
[03:14:21.170 --> 03:14:24.690]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[03:14:24.889 --> 03:14:27.510]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[03:14:27.649 --> 03:14:28.389]  I'm still not in shape.
[03:14:29.290 --> 03:14:30.709]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[03:14:30.829 --> 03:14:31.790]  Don't tell me eating right.
[03:14:31.889 --> 03:14:32.649]  I'm not going to buy that shit.
[03:14:33.469 --> 03:14:36.149]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[03:14:37.090 --> 03:14:37.969]  Oh, no.
[03:14:39.190 --> 03:14:40.850]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[03:14:41.569 --> 03:14:42.850]  Listen, I did it all.
[03:14:43.389 --> 03:14:46.950]  From the AlexJonesStore.com with Ultimate Seamoss, the ultimate seafood.
[03:14:47.170 --> 03:14:47.909]  That's why, right here.
[03:14:48.590 --> 03:14:53.729]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[03:14:53.790 --> 03:14:55.549]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[03:14:56.110 --> 03:14:57.469]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[03:15:00.229 --> 03:15:04.149]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss.
[03:15:04.229 --> 03:15:07.430]  And I am doing a plug here, because, you know, we could be shut down next Tuesday.
[03:15:08.049 --> 03:15:10.889]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court.
[03:15:10.930 --> 03:15:14.229]  But we'll continue on in the year one way or another, working with great folks.
