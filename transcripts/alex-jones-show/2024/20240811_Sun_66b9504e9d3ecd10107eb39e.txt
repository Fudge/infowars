[00:00:08.158 --> 00:00:08.658]  That's right.
[00:00:08.718 --> 00:00:09.198]  That's right.
[00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:09.818]  Here comes Gant!
[00:00:09.898 --> 00:00:10.679]  Here comes Gant!
[00:00:31.827 --> 00:00:55.005]  Nick Sandman, that now famous Covington, Kentucky teen that stood his ground and remained calm in the face of leftist lunacy, has a legal team filing hundreds of lawsuits against the media mob and celebrities that denigrated his family, his school, his fellow classmates, and himself for merely being a supporter of the sitting president and being at the wrong place at the wrong time.
[00:00:55.205 --> 00:01:07.090]  The Washington Post faces a 250 million dollar judgment and more are to quickly follow for defamation on a scale that can only be attributed to mental illness or Trump derangement syndrome.
[00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:16.675]  You would expect that the mainstream media would be responsible enough to pause, recognize they're dealing with a student,
[00:01:17.822 --> 00:01:41.239]  Investigate and make sure that they have the facts Accurate that the story that they tell is accurate, but they didn't pause when it came to Nicholas Because they wanted to rush out and they wanted to jump into the mob give the mob a megaphone So that they could attack this boy Because he was white.
[00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.420]  He's Catholic and
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.321]  And he was wearing a Make America Great Again cap.
[00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:54.066]  If Nicholas had not purchased that souvenir cap that day at the mall, if he was not wearing it, none of us would know who Nicholas Sandman is.
[00:01:54.266 --> 00:02:03.310]  The millennial Twitter hordes, who recently targeted an Austin, Texas kid for selling hot chocolate to support President Trump's border wall.
[00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.973]  I was against helping Donald Trump and then I saw the State of the Union address and I wanted to help him.
[00:02:08.213 --> 00:02:10.354]  He just said, Dad, I want to do a stand.
[00:02:12.815 --> 00:02:17.936]  Some people are mad and calling me a little Hitler and stuff and then some people are really happy.
[00:02:17.956 --> 00:02:23.858]  Somehow it's gotten skewed to think that we're teaching our son to hate and I don't understand where
[00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:34.538]  That comes from... I like all people.
[00:02:34.678 --> 00:02:39.862]  I think it's important that they know what's going on in the world, where we stand, what we believe in.
[00:02:40.062 --> 00:02:52.971]  After the local CBS affiliate posted the report to their Twitter feed, the mob piled on, posting a child being thrown off a cliff, another being thrown into a fire, and another posted a wrestler destroying a kid in his living room.
[00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:55.532]  A public celebration of child abuse.
[00:02:55.712 --> 00:03:02.015]  The moronic millennial horde called for the kid and his parents to be fined for not having a permit, which he didn't need.
[00:03:02.275 --> 00:03:04.536]  Also, for his parents to be arrested.
[00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:08.057]  All of this on the local CBS Affiliate's Twitter page.
[00:03:08.277 --> 00:03:14.963]  Twitter allows threats of violence of children from leftist mobs, regardless of their supposed rules.
[00:03:15.263 --> 00:03:16.164]  The sad truth?
[00:03:16.444 --> 00:03:18.666]  Millennials aren't really to blame.
[00:03:18.906 --> 00:03:34.200]  They've been indoctrinated by a scourge of Marxist anti-American re-education that has total control of the American school system from the bottom up, suckered into trading their individual freedoms for temporary triggers harboring
[00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:43.887]  When was the last time you checked your tyranny watch?
[00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:46.088]  Because we are way past midnight.
[00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.990]  What's wrong with you?
[00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.351]  Get off of me!
[00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:52.433]  You're not arresting me for nothing!
[00:03:52.453 --> 00:03:53.574]  I'm doing nothing wrong!
[00:03:53.594 --> 00:03:55.135]  Tase somebody over a mask.
[00:04:06.508 --> 00:04:20.155]  Most of us assume that our rights harboring this supposed ethical American society is like a rock that can't be moved, when in reality that boulder is being pushed over a cliff inch by inch, bit by bit every day.
[00:04:20.235 --> 00:04:26.519]  Obama put an internet kill switch in, where only selective sites will be allowed to be heard, selective groups, where the internet is only...
[00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:27.880]  A few channels.
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.961]  Wherever you go, you're basically fed the same thing.
[00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:47.914]  And this is Internet Kill Switch, where now Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, all of them are announcing, we will not let Trump, Republicans, or any of his supporters, where they already have keywords blocked, say he won, or debate it, or show numbers that he really won.
[00:04:54.013 --> 00:05:02.158]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.219]  I'm your host this evening, Chase Geyser.
[00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:07.560]  I will be on the air for the next three hours and 54 minutes.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.743]  In the final hour of the show today, we will be taking your calls because there is so much news for us to talk about.
[00:05:14.244 --> 00:05:15.305]  Breaking news this week.
[00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:19.208]  Prosecutors say Hunter Biden was bribed by a Romanian oligarch.
[00:05:19.288 --> 00:05:28.435]  And this is exciting because finally, prosecutors are admitting what has happened, what has been going on, and admitting how it is connected directly to the Biden regime and administration.
[00:05:28.475 --> 00:05:37.481]  It's not just the president's son who is responsible for this corruption, but it is a conspiracy that the president himself was involved in when he was the vice president of the United States.
[00:05:38.582 --> 00:05:43.929]  It is exceedingly frustrating because this is information that our government has had for years.
[00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:51.038]  Since even before the last election cycle was complete, this information was information that the government had.
[00:05:51.058 --> 00:05:55.824]  And frankly, before I was anybody online, I just simply had a podcast, a small podcast.
[00:05:56.425 --> 00:05:58.767]  I had the great Jack Maxey on the podcast.
[00:05:58.787 --> 00:06:10.355]  He was one of the first people, when he worked for Steve Bannon, to have access to the laptop from hell, to have scoured the contents of the laptop from hell, and to have told me about this relationship with this Romanian oligarch.
[00:06:10.375 --> 00:06:11.396]  So we're going to run some clips here.
[00:06:11.416 --> 00:06:12.757]  I want to go to clip 46 first.
[00:06:13.238 --> 00:06:19.542]  This is prosecutors explaining this bribery corruption between Hunter Biden and the Romanian oligarch.
[00:06:19.602 --> 00:06:19.923]  Clip number 46.
[00:06:22.635 --> 00:06:33.729]  It's not a new charge, but it is a new claim that the special counsel is making in a new court filing tied to Hunter Biden's tax case that's scheduled to go to trial next month in California.
[00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.616]  And the claim is that Hunter Biden was doing not illegal
[00:06:41.823 --> 00:06:45.265]  The special counsel does not allege that Hunter Biden did anything wrong.
[00:07:02.612 --> 00:07:15.113]  They say it's evidence that his mind was clear at the time he failed to pay his taxes, where of course Hunter Biden said his mind was not clear because he was deep in the throes of drug addiction.
[00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:19.288]  So, Hunter Biden was given money by a Romanian oligarch to influence U.S.
[00:07:19.328 --> 00:07:29.193]  policy when his father was vice president, according to a new filing in the tax case against the president's son, as written by RawEggNationalist on InfoWars.com.
[00:07:29.213 --> 00:07:39.458]  The court filing was made on Wednesday, alleges that Hunter Biden and a business associate took more than $3 million from Gabriel Papaviciu, a Romanian oligarch who sought to influence U.S.
[00:07:39.498 --> 00:07:41.879]  policy when Joe Biden was vice president in 2015.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.441]  Now, according to the prosecutors,
[00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:50.925]  Hunter Biden and his business associates were concerned that lobbying work might cause political ramifications for the defendant's father.
[00:07:51.285 --> 00:07:55.167]  So they structure the deal in order to conceal the true nature of the work he was performing.
[00:07:55.428 --> 00:08:02.072]  Now, this is clip number 80 of a small podcast that I did with Jack Maxey two years ago, where this information was revealed.
[00:08:02.152 --> 00:08:02.892]  Clip number 80 here.
[00:08:04.613 --> 00:08:10.597]  What happens is Hunter has a corrupt oligarch in Romania, a criminal.
[00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:23.039]  And the reason Hunter is friends with this guy and the reason Hunter has a business relationship with this guy, like very many of these criminals around the world, I believe the Chinese set it up.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.126]  And this guy's going to help grease the skids for the sale of the Ploiești oil fields in Romania.
[00:08:31.027 --> 00:08:33.268]  Very small oil field by today's standards.
[00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:40.353]  But if you remember World War II, Ploiești oil fields were the last source of oil, gasoline, etc.
[00:08:41.033 --> 00:08:42.454]  for the Nazi regime.
[00:08:43.415 --> 00:08:51.820]  More, probably, Army Air Corps men were killed bombing that airfield than were killed bombing Berlin.
[00:08:53.061 --> 00:08:58.825]  American air power operating from North Africa made a daring but costly attack upon the Romanian refineries.
[00:09:03.657 --> 00:09:16.627]  Now this is the motif of leftist policy.
[00:09:17.468 --> 00:09:32.960]  This reoccurring theme that it's okay to sell out the interests of the American people regardless of how many American soldiers have died defending the interests of the American people, regardless of how many American soldiers have died defending literal oil fields that are now just for sale to the CCP apparently.
[00:09:33.442 --> 00:09:38.346]  Through Romanian oligarchs in order to monetize the influence peddling.
[00:09:39.927 --> 00:09:46.651]  That was possible when Joe Biden was vice president of the United States and his son Hunter was traveling all over the world making deals with corrupt oligarchs.
[00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:51.995]  This is just one example of that in exchange for meetings with the president of the United States with the vice president of the United States.
[00:09:53.236 --> 00:09:53.937]  This level of corruption.
[00:09:53.957 --> 00:10:00.882]  I know it's old news and I know that Joe Biden isn't running anymore, but if you think that there's a difference between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, then you should really consider
[00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.411]  Your position again.
[00:10:03.692 --> 00:10:06.655]  You should really reconsider because they are exactly the same.
[00:10:06.695 --> 00:10:11.019]  The only difference is that Kamala Harris is not suffering from dementia or cognitive decline.
[00:10:11.059 --> 00:10:14.563]  She is every bit as stupid and corrupt as Joe Biden.
[00:10:14.603 --> 00:10:21.610]  Every bit as capable and willing to sacrifice the once interests and needs of the American people for the sake of her own political gain.
[00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.871]  And we're going to get into the clips today.
[00:10:23.812 --> 00:10:35.798]  Her bragging about how with the stroke of a pen, for example, she could charge anybody in the state of California with a misdemeanor and just wreck their lives, cause them humiliation, force them to be arrested, make them stand in line at court.
[00:10:35.818 --> 00:10:37.659]  She's bragging about her power.
[00:10:37.699 --> 00:10:40.020]  She's obviously drunk with her power.
[00:10:41.761 --> 00:10:50.646]  And though Joe Biden isn't running for office again, and though he's probably not even going to be president of the United States for very much longer, and though Hunter Biden is technically just the son of the president of the United States,
[00:10:51.636 --> 00:10:51.856]  I'm good.
[00:11:08.746 --> 00:11:10.927]  A fluke example of corruption among the left.
[00:11:11.167 --> 00:11:18.890]  This is something that leaders in the left and the right, members of our political class, this is the type of corruption that has been going on for decades.
[00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.651]  The only difference is we have all of the evidence.
[00:11:23.291 --> 00:11:27.774]  Proving the extent of this depravity with the Biden administration.
[00:11:28.114 --> 00:11:42.022]  And now it's gotten to a point where the leftists have succeeded to such an extent in their brainwashing of the American people that they can even admit their own corruption, admit their own political coups, without having any ramifications or accountability whatsoever.
[00:11:42.422 --> 00:11:46.104]  Without any pressure being brought to them by their own voters, by their own base.
[00:11:46.144 --> 00:11:49.587]  I mean, they stole the election in 2016 from Bernie, the primary election.
[00:11:50.407 --> 00:11:51.708]  Very little accountability there.
[00:11:52.898 --> 00:11:58.159]  And now they've stolen the election again from Joe Biden, who is technically supposed to be the nominee.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.180]  No accountability there.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.241]  Kamala Harris has zero votes to have supported her as the candidate based on this Democratic primary.
[00:12:05.781 --> 00:12:11.043]  And now we have Pelosi bragging about being responsible for this coup in clip number 22, which I'll call in a minute.
[00:12:11.983 --> 00:12:15.724]  And we have Joe Biden even admitting that he was forced out of the race himself.
[00:12:17.182 --> 00:12:33.712]  So the Democrats are even admitting that there was a blackmail conspiracy waged against the Biden administration in order to place Kamala in as the candidate despite the fact that she had no support in the primary, no votes in the primary, and Democrats are acting like this is just so exciting to have Kamala Harris as the candidate.
[00:12:33.952 --> 00:12:35.293]  This is just such great news.
[00:12:35.493 --> 00:12:41.276]  They are so brainwashed that they say yes daddy every time they get slapped in the face by their own leaders that they put into power.
[00:12:41.716 --> 00:12:42.017]  Clip number 22.
[00:12:44.119 --> 00:12:49.001]  I love him so much, I think he's been really a fantastic president of the United States.
[00:12:49.742 --> 00:12:54.924]  So I really wanted him to make a decision of a better campaign.
[00:12:56.145 --> 00:12:58.686]  Because they were not facing the fact of what was happening.
[00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:03.728]  Just a little background, I've never been that impressed with his political operation.
[00:13:04.549 --> 00:13:05.309]  Biden's operation?
[00:13:05.329 --> 00:13:05.929]  Yeah, I'm not.
[00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:07.710]  I mean, I just haven't been.
[00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.552]  They won the White House, bravo, right?
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:17.323]  So my concern was, this ain't happening.
[00:13:18.624 --> 00:13:22.146]  And we have to make a decision for this to happen.
[00:13:22.426 --> 00:13:25.488]  And the president has to make the decision for that to happen.
[00:13:25.828 --> 00:13:30.351]  Let me just say, I won't say necessarily I knew what I was doing at that time.
[00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:35.734]  I knew what I was doing in the whole thing, not just that show.
[00:13:35.834 --> 00:13:36.395]  And what was that?
[00:13:37.395 --> 00:13:41.298]  That Donald Trump would never set foot in the White House again.
[00:13:41.843 --> 00:13:47.105]  Now on clip number five, we have Joe Biden admitting that he was forced out of the 2024 race by top Democrats.
[00:13:47.945 --> 00:13:56.989]  In a Sunday interview, Joe Biden admitted that he was pressured to drop out of the 2024 election race by prominent Democrat colleagues.
[00:13:57.069 --> 00:14:02.011]  Obviously, Nancy Pelosi was among those colleagues because she just admitted that she forced him out in that interview there.
[00:14:02.071 --> 00:14:02.971]  But this is clip number five.
[00:14:05.097 --> 00:14:08.679]  The polls we had showed that it was a neck-and-neck race.
[00:14:08.699 --> 00:14:10.079]  We would have been down to the wire.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:20.324]  But what happened was a number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races.
[00:14:21.525 --> 00:14:27.750]  And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic you'd be interviewing me about.
[00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.692]  Why did Nancy Pelosi say, why did someone?
[00:14:31.773 --> 00:14:34.275]  And I thought it'd be a real distraction.
[00:14:34.856 --> 00:14:37.718]  Clip number six, Donald Trump says the same exact thing.
[00:14:38.218 --> 00:14:46.225]  Admits that this was a coup, that this was the subversion of the democratic process to elect a candidate.
[00:14:48.066 --> 00:14:51.547]  To represent the Democrats in this race for the general election for the President of the United States.
[00:14:51.567 --> 00:14:52.107]  Clip number six.
[00:14:52.687 --> 00:14:54.947]  The presidency was taken away from Joe Biden.
[00:14:55.528 --> 00:15:02.909]  And I'm no Biden fan, but I'll tell you what, from a constitutional standpoint, from any standpoint you look at, they took the presidency away.
[00:15:03.929 --> 00:15:06.710]  And people are saying he lost after the debate, he couldn't win.
[00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.790]  Well, I don't know that that's true necessarily.
[00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.211]  But whether he could win or he couldn't win, he had the right to run.
[00:15:13.092 --> 00:15:13.813]  And they took it away.
[00:15:13.853 --> 00:15:15.915]  They said they're going to use the 25th Amendment.
[00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:16.916]  They're going to hit you hard.
[00:15:16.976 --> 00:15:22.561]  Either we can do it the nice — I heard — I know exactly, because I know a lot of people on the other side, believe it or not.
[00:15:23.482 --> 00:15:27.726]  And they said, we'll do it the nice way, or we'll do it the hard way.
[00:15:28.767 --> 00:15:30.989]  And he said, all right.
[00:15:31.952 --> 00:15:36.434]  So it's abundantly clear that this was a coup.
[00:15:36.954 --> 00:15:49.401]  This was the entire compromise of our election process, our so-called democratic process in our constitutional republic, of selecting candidates to lead major parties in general elections for major offices, like the President of the United States.
[00:15:49.921 --> 00:16:00.486]  This is a political coup that is akin to, if not worse, much worse, frankly, than the January 6th insurrection that so many committees have been formed over
[00:16:00.486 --> 00:16:00.846]  We're good to go.
[00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:22.232]  Just sitting pleasantly with members of The View being photographed.
[00:16:22.252 --> 00:16:27.116]  He's just, he's delighted to be associated with these leftist hogs, which is exactly what they are.
[00:16:27.616 --> 00:16:39.126]  Delighted to be associated with the entire corruption and subversion of our nation, the undermining of the interests of the American people at the highest levels from the worst people in the world, perhaps even in the history of the world.
[00:16:40.207 --> 00:16:42.709]  All of this over these January 6th claims.
[00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:55.096]  And we've literally witnessed a coup right before our eyes, all in the context of an assassination attempt on the former president, Donald J. Trump, which everybody in the world seems to have forgotten about.
[00:16:55.116 --> 00:17:01.939]  And there are rumors circulating that Tim Walz and his staff have been bragging about the extent to which that news is already forgotten.
[00:17:03.669 --> 00:17:16.156]  How quickly it is that the American people lose focus on the key points that actually matter, the key details that actually matter, like, I don't know, selecting your candidate for your party to be the candidate for the President of the United States?
[00:17:16.476 --> 00:17:17.577]  That seems to be pretty important.
[00:17:17.617 --> 00:17:22.720]  Or the fact that the Deep State attempted to assassinate the former President of the United States, and if they didn't directly attempt
[00:17:24.008 --> 00:17:35.615]  To make this happen, they certainly stood down and watched as it happened intentionally because all of the interests of the political class are abundantly under threat at the notion that Donald Trump will have a second term as President of the United States.
[00:17:35.635 --> 00:17:40.298]  So everything is being done that can be done in order to get in the way of allowing this to happen.
[00:17:41.681 --> 00:17:57.656]  They're willing to kill him, they're willing to imprison him, they're willing to imprison you, they're willing to kill you, they're willing to totally compromise the interests of their own base by blackmailing the rightful candidates for their own races and just appointing a better candidate who can put a sentence together, barely, but put a sentence together, I mean...
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:15.640]  I can't believe that the likes of Jesse Ventura and others actually support this woman after all that she has done and failed to do, done in order to totally compromise the authenticity of this election, and all that she has failed to do as Vice President of the United States when she was the borders
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:15.880]  I don't know.
[00:18:33.638 --> 00:18:34.838]  I'm going to be selfish.
[00:18:35.419 --> 00:18:41.021]  A few years ago, I got the opportunity to see the United States elect its first black president.
[00:18:41.501 --> 00:18:43.122]  I didn't think that could ever happen.
[00:18:43.502 --> 00:18:44.962]  And they even reelected him.
[00:18:45.483 --> 00:18:48.244]  Well, now, I'm going to be selfish again.
[00:18:48.684 --> 00:18:50.605]  I've only got a few elections to go.
[00:18:50.705 --> 00:18:53.966]  I'm 73 years old now, so the window's closing.
[00:18:54.606 --> 00:19:05.135]  I want to be alive to see the first woman president of the United States of America and the first woman commander-in-chief, and we've got her right now.
[00:19:06.757 --> 00:19:10.320]  Governor, thank you so much for sharing your views on this issue.
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:14.183]  I think a lot of people have been very interested to hear what you have said.
[00:19:14.363 --> 00:19:18.207]  So you are officially endorsing the Harris-Waltz ticket, excuse me.
[00:19:19.286 --> 00:19:21.448]  Yes, I want to see a woman president.
[00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:23.270]  It's time for a woman president.
[00:19:23.651 --> 00:19:25.653]  We men have screwed it up enough.
[00:19:26.914 --> 00:19:30.238]  Okay, so you're going to vote for Kamala Harris just because she's a woman.
[00:19:30.739 --> 00:19:34.503]  That is the dumbest, most DEI BS ever.
[00:19:35.043 --> 00:19:38.247]  That's as dumb as not voting for her because she's a woman.
[00:19:39.445 --> 00:19:43.168]  Do you think that somehow women are morally superior to men?
[00:19:43.969 --> 00:19:52.417]  Do you think somehow that just by virtue of being women, that makes them morally more capable or morally superior in any way, shape, or form?
[00:19:52.897 --> 00:19:53.118]  Smart?
[00:19:54.078 --> 00:20:03.127]  One thing that we need to just understand as people of the earth, as human beings, regardless of any of our other immutable characteristics, is that we are all equally capable of incompetence and evil.
[00:20:04.107 --> 00:20:13.350]  Regardless of whether you're black, white, female, male, whatever religion, whatever other immutable characteristic that you've been bestowed with, we are all equally capable of doing terrible things.
[00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.991]  There is no group among us who is morally superior.
[00:20:17.031 --> 00:20:25.113]  There's no group among us who is more or less capable than any other group of doing terrible things, of screwing up the presidency of the United States of America.
[00:20:25.133 --> 00:20:28.475]  So to vote for her just because she's a woman is totally stupid.
[00:20:28.495 --> 00:20:32.916]  And frankly, you think women haven't been in control over the course of the last thousands of years?
[00:20:33.416 --> 00:20:42.921]  You think just because it's men that are written about in history books like Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar or others, that there wasn't a woman behind those people?
[00:20:42.961 --> 00:20:45.402]  That there weren't women behind these people manipulating?
[00:20:45.422 --> 00:20:48.924]  Have you ever read the book The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene?
[00:20:49.324 --> 00:20:49.964]  Brilliant book!
[00:20:50.004 --> 00:21:01.450]  Historical analysis of how seduction has been used for thousands of years and is well documented by women in order to manipulate men in power, whether it's business power or political power, to do things like wage wars.
[00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:02.851]  We're good to go.
[00:21:24.335 --> 00:21:33.604]  In the context of the political campaign and war that has gone on between factions of human beings over the course of thousands of years?
[00:21:34.204 --> 00:21:34.945]  Give me a break.
[00:21:34.985 --> 00:21:39.609]  Just because she's a woman doesn't mean that we're trying something new, folks.
[00:21:40.515 --> 00:21:43.459]  It's not us trying something new, doing things differently.
[00:21:43.499 --> 00:21:53.070]  She's exactly the same as Joe Biden and Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton and all the other leftists who have been in power for decades and sought power for decades.
[00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:54.391]  She's exactly the same.
[00:21:55.367 --> 00:21:57.508]  The only thing is, she's maybe a little bit more arrogant about it.
[00:21:57.548 --> 00:21:58.448]  Maybe she's a little dumber.
[00:21:58.468 --> 00:21:59.649]  It has nothing to do with her being a woman.
[00:21:59.669 --> 00:22:00.649]  She's just kind of dumb.
[00:22:01.249 --> 00:22:02.990]  But she's not to be underestimated, folks.
[00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:12.874]  And she has found a way to climb the ladder of political influence using seduction, as I just mentioned, just like women have been doing for thousands of years.
[00:22:14.642 --> 00:22:16.764]  And this is the fake record that they have, both of them.
[00:22:16.804 --> 00:22:18.645]  This is according to Trump in clip number 13 here.
[00:22:18.865 --> 00:22:21.226]  Trump blasts Kamala and Waltz in Bozeman.
[00:22:21.387 --> 00:22:28.631]  Former President Donald Trump blasted Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Waltz as phonies at his latest rally in Bozeman, Montana.
[00:22:28.651 --> 00:22:29.312]  Clip number 13.
[00:22:30.493 --> 00:22:31.974]  So don't take my word for it.
[00:22:32.054 --> 00:22:36.497]  Listen, Kamala Harris's agenda straight from her own mouth.
[00:22:36.517 --> 00:22:37.857]  Would anybody like to see her?
[00:22:37.877 --> 00:22:39.198]  Let's do it for a couple of seconds.
[00:22:39.459 --> 00:22:39.859]  Go ahead.
[00:22:41.345 --> 00:22:42.025]  Yeah, I am radical.
[00:22:42.265 --> 00:22:45.447]  We need to get radical about what we are doing and take it seriously.
[00:22:45.687 --> 00:22:54.852]  As President of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal.
[00:22:54.872 --> 00:22:56.773]  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking.
[00:22:58.894 --> 00:23:02.436]  We have to have a buyback program and I support a mandatory buyback program.
[00:23:04.977 --> 00:23:07.298]  I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance.
[00:23:07.598 --> 00:23:08.679]  Let's eliminate all of that.
[00:23:10.418 --> 00:23:13.239]  But would you support changing the dietary guidelines?
[00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:13.519]  Yes!
[00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:14.780]  You know, the food pyramid.
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.680]  Yes, yes.
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:19.202]  To reduce red meat specifically.
[00:23:19.222 --> 00:23:19.862]  Yes, I would.
[00:23:20.102 --> 00:23:27.205]  Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
[00:23:27.245 --> 00:23:30.087]  Where do you stand on defund the police?
[00:23:30.147 --> 00:23:35.069]  This whole movement is about rightly saying, we need to take a look at these budgets.
[00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:41.906]  Harris asserted that ICE is perceived as the modern-day Ku Klux Klan.
[00:23:42.166 --> 00:23:43.848]  Are you aware that there's a perception?
[00:23:43.868 --> 00:23:44.408]  I see no perception.
[00:23:44.929 --> 00:23:46.070]  Are you aware that there's a perception?
[00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.492]  That puts ICE in the same category as the KKK.
[00:23:48.572 --> 00:23:50.133]  Is that what you're asking me?
[00:23:50.474 --> 00:23:51.174]  I see no parallel.
[00:23:51.194 --> 00:23:51.855]  I'm not finished.
[00:23:51.875 --> 00:23:52.335]  I see none.
[00:23:53.997 --> 00:23:55.278]  Eddie, I am radical.
[00:23:55.318 --> 00:23:57.220]  We need to get radical about what we are doing.
[00:24:03.593 --> 00:24:04.534]  Absolutely unbelievable.
[00:24:04.554 --> 00:24:13.660]  And of course she brags about the fact that she's going to hire so many new ICE agents right after that ad where she's compared ICE agents to the KKK.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.883]  And she tries to backpedal it and walk away from it a little bit by saying, are you aware that there's a perception?
[00:24:18.943 --> 00:24:29.851]  By not actually making the accusation herself, but just citing the perception, she's able to make the accusation without suffering the political accountability for such an outrageous accusation.
[00:24:29.891 --> 00:24:31.892]  But here she is in clip number 39 admitting
[00:24:34.493 --> 00:24:49.939]  That this immigration situation has been a disaster all after the fact that she has been, the immigrations are, all after the fact that she still is the Vice President of the United States of America, still a very influential member of this administration being, you know, number two and all.
[00:24:50.219 --> 00:24:52.700]  She could go to Joe and say, look, these are the policies I want to implement.
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.002]  Why does she have to wait to get elected to do the right thing for America?
[00:24:56.042 --> 00:24:56.342]  Here's clip 39.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:05.664]  America has tried so many of those failed policies before, and like we all know, we're not going back.
[00:25:11.768 --> 00:25:17.991]  We will move forward and take on the biggest issues facing our nation.
[00:25:18.812 --> 00:25:21.954]  For example, the issue of immigration.
[00:25:23.291 --> 00:25:25.792]  So I was Attorney General of a border state.
[00:25:26.753 --> 00:25:31.876]  I went after the transnational gangs, the drug cartels, and human traffickers.
[00:25:32.716 --> 00:25:36.959]  I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won.
[00:25:36.979 --> 00:25:42.822]  So I know what I'm talking about.
[00:25:44.023 --> 00:25:49.446]  We know our immigration system is broken, and we know what it takes to fix it.
[00:25:51.371 --> 00:25:57.940]  Folks, we're going to get into more details about how full of it she is.
[00:26:07.737 --> 00:26:21.110]  And how urgent this is to undermine her campaign at every possible opportunity every possible level until November 5th because it felt after June 27th like this was going to be a walk in the park because that debate performance was terrible.
[00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:25.675]  It felt after July 13th when this assassination attempt took place.
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.502]  That this was going to be a walk in the park that Trump just won the election.
[00:26:29.782 --> 00:26:36.488]  But the fact of the matter is the leftists who are so brainwashed have forgotten the atrocities of this administration.
[00:26:36.788 --> 00:26:39.250]  They have forgotten the terrible performance on June 27th.
[00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.852]  They have forgotten the repeated failures of Kamala Harris.
[00:26:41.872 --> 00:26:51.059]  And they have forgotten the fact that the deep state attempted to take the life of the former president of the United States because he is the only one that is a threat to America's greatest enemy, our own
[00:26:52.318 --> 00:26:55.720]  Fourth unchecked branch of government that is the Deep State.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.542]  And that's why it's more important now than ever that you support InfoWars.
[00:26:59.602 --> 00:27:15.731]  This is the most important election in the history of the United States of America, perhaps in the history of the world, and it cannot be won by the right candidate, by Donald Trump, if freedom of speech is not protected and the truth is not broadcast worldwide like it is on InfoWars.
[00:27:15.751 --> 00:27:17.852]  So please go to InfoWarsStore.com

[00:27:47.046 --> 00:27:48.767]  I'm your host this evening, Chase Geiser.
[00:27:48.807 --> 00:27:51.029]  Alex Jones will be back in studio tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:51.369]  Central.
[00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:53.611]  Make sure you tune in starting at 8 a.m.
[00:27:53.671 --> 00:28:03.559]  on weekdays for the American Journal, hosted by the great Harrison Smith, immediately followed by the Alex Jones Show, hosted by, of course, Alex Jones, and then the War Room, hosted by Owen Schroer.
[00:28:03.579 --> 00:28:07.943]  We've got nine hours, 10 hours a day of original content live streamed, covering the news.
[00:28:08.283 --> 00:28:11.386]  Not only what's happening now, but what's going to happen next every single day.
[00:28:11.946 --> 00:28:19.874]  And the more you listen, the more informed you will be and the more support we can get to stay on the air and save InfoWars and consequently save humanity.
[00:28:20.014 --> 00:28:22.396]  Because ultimately that's what this broadcast is about.
[00:28:22.676 --> 00:28:23.997]  That's what this network is about.
[00:28:24.017 --> 00:28:32.425]  It's about saving humanity for those anti-humanist, depopulation, genocidal sociopaths
[00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:49.992]  Within our own political class and the political class of the world who seek to conglomerate all political power into one globalist new world order, new world government for the sake of subjugating all of humanity and eradicating those humans who they deem unfit or unvaluable to their political agenda.
[00:28:50.352 --> 00:28:55.674]  That's what's coming if InfoWars shuts down, if Donald Trump loses this election in 2024, literally the end of the world.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.561]  And if you don't believe me, just listen to this clip.
[00:29:03.581 --> 00:29:03.561]  33.
[00:29:03.901 --> 00:29:04.681]  Diabolical.
[00:29:04.721 --> 00:29:10.462]  Kamala Harris says that reducing population to save children during Green Agenda Run is the way to go.
[00:29:10.482 --> 00:29:12.402]  That population reduction is necessary.
[00:29:12.442 --> 00:29:16.003]  How do you, tell me, how do you reduce the population without committing a Kamala cost?
[00:29:16.043 --> 00:29:17.463]  Kamala, clip number 33.
[00:29:19.663 --> 00:29:29.725]  When we invest in clean energy and electric vehicles and reduce population, more of our children can breathe clean air and drink clean water.
[00:29:30.307 --> 00:29:36.210]  And she walked that back later, saying that she was misunderstood or she misspoke about the depopulation, but that doesn't just come out of nowhere.
[00:29:36.591 --> 00:29:55.942]  You say that because of the meetings that you've had with climate change activists, with Green New Deal activists, with the types of people that were responsible for the creation, establishment, building of the Georgia Guidestones, which advocated for a population on the earth of 500 million people, meaning that, what, 11 twelfths of the planet would have to be eradicated?
[00:29:56.362 --> 00:29:56.822]  At least?
[00:29:56.842 --> 00:29:57.483]  11 out of 12 people?
[00:29:59.448 --> 00:30:09.520]  We are talking about a political philosophy that advocates for the mass destruction, murder, and genocide of the vast majority of human beings on the planet.
[00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:14.206]  And all of their policies promote this, improve this, because if you look at what happens...
[00:30:14.887 --> 00:30:22.572]  If we eradicate so-called fossil fuels from the economy tomorrow, everybody in third world countries dies within like a year.
[00:30:23.173 --> 00:30:41.625]  If you look at what happens when there's an EMP attack on the United States of America, estimates from reputable studies conducted by our own government have determined that 90% of the population in the United States of America would die within 12 months if power was totally taken away from our population, if there was no electrical power whatsoever.
[00:30:41.965 --> 00:30:44.307]  This is the type of world that the leftists want,
[00:30:45.027 --> 00:30:54.670]  Because they understand that the more suffering that people face, the more liberties, rights, freedoms they hand over for the sake of any relief from that suffering.
[00:30:55.470 --> 00:31:00.992]  They want to slow walk us into a slaughter because they are so power drunk and satanic whether they know it or not.
[00:31:01.272 --> 00:31:04.473]  And not only are they satanic and power drunk, but they're abundantly stupid.
[00:31:05.113 --> 00:31:05.834]  Just look at clip number 12.
[00:31:06.394 --> 00:31:12.636]  This is a savage clip that Trump played, which is a compilation of Kamala Harris's incoherent word salads during the rally.
[00:31:12.656 --> 00:31:12.936]  Clip number 12.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:18.763]  Kamala is grossly incompetent and, in my opinion, has a very low IQ.
[00:31:18.983 --> 00:31:21.844]  But we'll find out about her IQ during the debate, okay?
[00:31:21.864 --> 00:31:23.385]  Let's find out about her IQ.
[00:31:28.729 --> 00:31:31.070]  So, you know, we have this great system.
[00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:33.512]  I want to show you just one other thing, please.
[00:31:33.532 --> 00:31:34.952]  Do you mind putting it up, please?
[00:31:35.052 --> 00:31:35.453]  Thank you.
[00:31:36.013 --> 00:31:37.014]  We've been to the border.
[00:31:37.054 --> 00:31:37.894]  You haven't been to the border.
[00:31:39.255 --> 00:31:40.476]  And I haven't been to Europe.
[00:31:42.535 --> 00:31:44.456]  I don't understand the point that you're making.
[00:31:44.496 --> 00:31:46.756]  I'm talking about the significance of the passage of time.
[00:31:47.796 --> 00:31:48.076]  Right?
[00:31:48.116 --> 00:31:50.257]  The significance of the passage of time.
[00:31:50.977 --> 00:31:55.038]  So when you think about it, there is great significance to the passage of time.
[00:31:55.238 --> 00:31:58.939]  Ukraine is a country in Europe.
[00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:02.619]  It exists next to another country called Russia.
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.360]  Russia is a bigger country.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.020]  Russia is a power country.
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.701]  Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine.
[00:32:09.981 --> 00:32:12.304]  So basically that's wrong.
[00:32:12.464 --> 00:32:20.755]  So you're now no longer are you necessarily keeping those private files in some file cabinet that's locked in the basement of the house.
[00:32:21.957 --> 00:32:27.444]  It's on your laptop and it's then therefore up here in this cloud.
[00:32:28.465 --> 00:32:30.525]  That exists above us, right?
[00:32:30.545 --> 00:32:36.086]  The Caribbean nations, island nations, in the Western Hemisphere.
[00:32:36.827 --> 00:32:38.107]  That is where the Caribbean is.
[00:32:38.247 --> 00:32:39.927]  We are also in the Western Hemisphere.
[00:32:39.987 --> 00:32:41.067]  They are our neighbors.
[00:32:41.367 --> 00:32:50.949]  I am here, standing here, on the northern flank, on the eastern flank, talking about what we have in terms of the eastern flank.
[00:32:51.049 --> 00:32:54.130]  I can imagine what can be and be unburdened by what has been.
[00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:55.171]  You know?
[00:32:55.832 --> 00:32:57.054]  Space is exciting!
[00:32:57.074 --> 00:33:02.722]  It is time for us to do what we have been doing and that time is every day.
[00:33:04.244 --> 00:33:13.168]  Every day it is time for us to agree that there are things and tools that are available to us to slow this thing down.
[00:33:13.288 --> 00:33:23.273]  We will work together and continue to work together to address these issues, to tackle these challenges, and to work together as we continue to work.
[00:33:23.293 --> 00:33:24.993]  Do you ban plastic straws?
[00:33:25.334 --> 00:33:25.934]  I think we should.
[00:33:26.494 --> 00:33:26.774]  Yes.
[00:33:27.075 --> 00:33:28.456]  I mean, look, I'm going to be honest.
[00:33:28.636 --> 00:33:35.021]  It's really difficult to drink out of a paper straw when you had, if you just, like, if you don't gulp it down immediately, it starts to bend.
[00:33:35.961 --> 00:33:37.823]  And then, you know, the little thing catches it.
[00:33:37.863 --> 00:33:42.786]  And then, you know, so we got to kind of perfect that one a little bit more.
[00:33:42.887 --> 00:33:45.348]  Do you know, okay, a bit of a history lesson.
[00:33:45.649 --> 00:33:51.693]  Do you know that women were not, the women's teams were not allowed to have brackets until 2022?
[00:33:51.733 --> 00:33:52.234]  So the United States
[00:33:55.716 --> 00:34:01.381]  Shares a very important relationship, which is an alliance with the Republic of North Korea.
[00:34:01.501 --> 00:34:03.262]  AI is kind of fancy things.
[00:34:03.442 --> 00:34:04.563]  First of all, it's two layers.
[00:34:05.063 --> 00:34:06.965]  It means artificial intelligence.
[00:34:07.085 --> 00:34:07.585]  As a woman.
[00:34:09.206 --> 00:34:15.711]  There's a balance to be struck between being tough and being a ****.
[00:34:35.768 --> 00:34:41.815]  I swear to God, so if you watching her speak is like is like watching the intro to 2001 A Space Odyssey.
[00:34:42.616 --> 00:34:47.382]  It's just babbling violence in vitriol and incoherent sociopathy.
[00:34:47.822 --> 00:34:49.164]  That's that's what Kamala Harris is.
[00:34:49.184 --> 00:34:52.988]  And if you don't believe that she's just dumb and now you believe she's dumb, but maybe she's got the right.
[00:34:53.989 --> 00:35:13.175]  ...character or mentality for office, then just watch clip number 42 where she brags about her power as Attorney General with the stroke of a pen, what she could accomplish in order to ruin the lives of anyone that she wanted by charging them with misdemeanors, and just extrapolate what you think this means for any right-wing patriotic American who supported Trump.
[00:35:13.755 --> 00:35:26.906]  Up until this point, what do you think if she did this in clip number 42, if she did this in California to her political opponents or those she saw as inferior in the state, what do you think she will do to you, who she hates more than anything in the world, mind you?
[00:35:27.187 --> 00:35:36.675]  She hates you, the patriotic listener of InfoWars, more than perhaps any other demographic in the entire world, more than any other section of the population of the entire planet.
[00:35:37.015 --> 00:35:37.916]  She hates you the most.
[00:35:37.936 --> 00:35:40.838]  So what do you think she's going to do to you if she's bragging like this in clip 42?
[00:35:42.298 --> 00:35:52.328]  You know, the power I have as a prosecutor is that with a swipe of my pen, I can charge someone with a misdemeanor, the lowest level offense possible.
[00:35:53.469 --> 00:35:55.331]  And by virtue of that swipe of my pen,
[00:35:56.533 --> 00:35:59.475]  You will have to go to a courthouse and stand in line.
[00:36:00.096 --> 00:36:02.377]  You will have to come out of pocket and hire an attorney.
[00:36:02.778 --> 00:36:04.519]  You may get arrested for a few hours.
[00:36:04.839 --> 00:36:07.181]  You will be embarrassed in your community.
[00:36:07.581 --> 00:36:10.544]  You will miss time from coming onto the Google campus.
[00:36:11.484 --> 00:36:17.129]  All because with the swipe of my pen I've charged you with a crime, which I may choose to dismiss two weeks later.
[00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:20.311]  It's an incredible amount of power.
[00:36:20.331 --> 00:36:21.312]  Unbelievable.
[00:36:22.335 --> 00:36:24.982]  How you would just wave your sword like that.
[00:36:25.162 --> 00:36:29.834]  How you would just brandish your political power like that to threaten and intimidate anybody.
[00:36:30.683 --> 00:36:31.584]  In your population.
[00:36:31.604 --> 00:36:37.388]  I mean, this is very similar to what we've seen from the United Kingdom over the course of the last couple of weeks, especially the last week with.
[00:36:38.249 --> 00:36:50.398]  Administrators, prime ministers, other law enforcement officials coming out and just bragging about the level of prosecution, persecution and imprisonment that will be conducted against anybody who stands up for their rights, their country and what they believe in.
[00:36:50.799 --> 00:36:58.765]  This is tyrannical BS coming straight from Kamala Harris, and I can't believe that so many of our population are falling for it.
[00:36:59.065 --> 00:36:59.886]  And supporting this person.
[00:36:59.926 --> 00:37:15.597]  And clip number seven, just look at what the family of slain San Francisco cop has to say as they speak out over Kamala's role in sparing the killer of their family member, this San Francisco cop, sparing the killer of their family, the death penalty here.
[00:37:15.637 --> 00:37:16.258]  Clip number seven.
[00:37:17.378 --> 00:37:18.379]  My little girl.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.381]  Isaac Espinosa.
[00:37:20.541 --> 00:37:21.862]  Yay!
[00:37:22.362 --> 00:37:23.203]  Young father.
[00:37:23.223 --> 00:37:24.323]  Come on to daddy.
[00:37:24.343 --> 00:37:25.805]  There you go!
[00:37:27.563 --> 00:37:28.744]  Devoted husband.
[00:37:31.647 --> 00:37:33.409]  And San Francisco police officer.
[00:37:33.909 --> 00:37:36.111]  Until his end of watch, April 10th, 2004.
[00:37:36.672 --> 00:37:42.237]  His captain comes over and I'm just sitting there and he hands me his star.
[00:37:43.919 --> 00:37:48.664]  I remember I walk into this room and he still had blood here.
[00:37:49.064 --> 00:37:51.847]  He was laying there with his eyes closed and I saw the blood here.
[00:37:53.539 --> 00:37:56.601]  And I walked over to him and I was just like, wake up.
[00:37:59.762 --> 00:38:06.746]  Just 29, Espinoza was gunned down with an AK-47 by a 21-year-old gang member.
[00:38:07.487 --> 00:38:13.410]  A new district attorney had just been elected in San Francisco, Kamala Harris, her first elected position.
[00:38:14.266 --> 00:38:21.791]  Three days after Officer Espinoza's death, Harris held a news conference, pledging to keep a campaign promise.
[00:38:22.332 --> 00:38:23.733]  No death penalty.
[00:38:24.213 --> 00:38:37.502]  In San Francisco, it is the will, I believe, of a majority of people that the most severe crimes be met with the most severe consequences, and that life without possibility of parole is a severe consequence.
[00:38:37.742 --> 00:38:41.728]  I felt like she had just taken something from us.
[00:38:41.909 --> 00:38:44.252]  She had just taken justice from us.
[00:38:44.673 --> 00:38:45.474]  From Isaac.
[00:38:45.735 --> 00:38:46.416]  Did she call you?
[00:38:47.197 --> 00:38:47.377]  No.
[00:38:47.678 --> 00:38:48.559]  She never called me.
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.444]  I just don't understand how or why she would...
[00:38:52.927 --> 00:38:55.088]  You can't even wait till he's buried.
[00:38:55.108 --> 00:38:58.110]  You can't even wait to talk to the family.
[00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:05.053]  You can't just wait and, you know, have some compassion and check in on the family.
[00:39:05.193 --> 00:39:07.714]  And I'm standing there and I'm going, oh my god.
[00:39:07.955 --> 00:39:14.618]  Gary Delanus, the man standing next to Harris, was the president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association at the time.
[00:39:14.978 --> 00:39:21.220]  You're thinking to yourself, okay, is she sorry that this kid died or is this just a political opportunity?
[00:39:21.701 --> 00:39:25.922]  Is this just an opportunity for her to double down on the fact she's not going to pursue the death penalty?
[00:39:26.222 --> 00:39:30.764]  What would her motives be to do this so soon after the death?
[00:39:33.246 --> 00:39:36.189]  The political blowback for Harris was enormous.
[00:39:38.031 --> 00:39:41.675]  At Espinosa's funeral, as Harris sat in the pews, U.S.
[00:39:41.715 --> 00:39:47.621]  Senator Dianne Feinstein indirectly rebuked the new DA for not seeking the death penalty.
[00:39:48.162 --> 00:39:52.547]  The hundreds of officers gave Feinstein a standing ovation.
[00:39:53.587 --> 00:39:56.468]  But as far as the Harris voters are concerned, this is absolutely no problem.
[00:39:56.488 --> 00:39:57.748]  We're going to run clip 10 next.
[00:39:57.849 --> 00:39:58.209]  Watch.
[00:39:58.369 --> 00:40:00.889]  Are people really voting for Kamala Harris?
[00:40:00.909 --> 00:40:04.411]  We're going to show you some man-in-the-street footage of people being approached.
[00:40:04.451 --> 00:40:05.951]  Let's see if they actually support Harris.
[00:40:05.971 --> 00:40:13.033]  And then we'll show you another video, clip 36, in a moment of some actual Harris supporters and how maniacal they seem.
[00:40:13.053 --> 00:40:15.454]  But first off, let's look at clip number 10 here and see what people think.
[00:40:16.863 --> 00:40:17.524]  What's up, guys?
[00:40:17.624 --> 00:40:18.385]  Alex Stranger here.
[00:40:18.405 --> 00:40:30.597]  We are out on 6th Street in Austin, Texas asking people how they feel about a Kamala Harris presidency in order to determine whether or not there has actually been a vibe shift these past few weeks.
[00:40:30.657 --> 00:40:32.199]  So, uh, let's see what happens.
[00:40:32.859 --> 00:40:35.841]  How do you feel about Kamala Harris being President of the United States?
[00:40:36.121 --> 00:40:39.143]  I'd rather kill myself than have her be the President, if I'm being honest.
[00:40:39.843 --> 00:40:43.906]  How excited are you about Kamala Harris being the President of the United States?
[00:40:44.306 --> 00:40:47.668]  I don't know shit about politics, but if it's a girl, hell no.
[00:40:47.908 --> 00:40:48.349]  Why not?
[00:40:48.749 --> 00:40:50.010]  Because girls are too emotional.
[00:40:52.501 --> 00:40:55.022]  If they own a period one day we might go to war.
[00:40:55.522 --> 00:41:05.907]  How would you feel if you were dating somebody for four years and your boyfriend decided to break up with you over text message and then recommend a new partner for you?
[00:41:07.128 --> 00:41:09.409]  No, I think I'd be really pissed.
[00:41:10.089 --> 00:41:11.290]  I don't think that's okay.
[00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:15.012]  And I'm only asking this because it's kind of similar to like
[00:41:15.772 --> 00:41:17.873]  Do you think that we should repeal the 19th Amendment?
[00:41:17.893 --> 00:41:19.554]  What is the 19th Amendment?
[00:41:19.614 --> 00:41:20.874]  It gives women the right to vote.
[00:41:43.092 --> 00:41:43.713]  Probably.
[00:41:44.093 --> 00:41:46.494]  What makes you excited about Kamala Harris?
[00:41:47.054 --> 00:41:49.355]  Because she is far more better than Donald Trump.
[00:41:49.515 --> 00:41:50.275]  Far more better.
[00:41:50.315 --> 00:41:53.716]  What do you think Make America Great Again says about bring back slavery?
[00:41:53.776 --> 00:41:57.938]  How excited are you about Kamala Harris being president of the United States?
[00:41:57.978 --> 00:41:58.598]  Fuck that bitch!
[00:41:58.678 --> 00:41:59.819]  Fuck that bitch!
[00:41:59.859 --> 00:42:02.199]  If we vote for Kamala, you're a piece of shit!
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.500]  Get out of our country!
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:07.462]  Now this next clip, clip number 36, absolutely blew my mind.
[00:42:07.522 --> 00:42:26.691]  Let's look at what these Kamala voters have to say and just observe and let me know maybe in the last hour today when we take calls what you think of this mentality, this culture, these types of people who are based on just reason and logic and emotionless mental clarity and sanity and mental health supporting Kamala Harris for President of the United States.
[00:42:26.731 --> 00:42:26.891]  Clip 36.
[00:42:28.447 --> 00:42:30.129]  Why are y'all voting for Kamala Harris?
[00:42:30.469 --> 00:42:31.490]  I don't want to lose my rights.
[00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:38.737]  Like, I'm a trans man and I'm gay and I have been pregnant and I've had an abortion before and I don't want to lose that.
[00:42:39.158 --> 00:42:45.064]  I'm afraid of not being able to be myself anymore because from what I've heard, Trump's America doesn't want me to look like this.
[00:42:45.624 --> 00:42:48.948]  So, that's why I'm here today and that's why I'm voting blue.
[00:42:49.608 --> 00:42:50.349]  What about you?
[00:42:50.449 --> 00:42:52.471]  I've also been pregnant and had an abortion before.
[00:42:52.491 --> 00:43:01.400]  I was a minor and it would have been dangerous for me to properly, like, it would have been dangerous for me to carry a baby with, like, personal reasons and everything.
[00:43:02.701 --> 00:43:05.303]  I also, like, I'm very, you know,
[00:43:06.621 --> 00:43:07.141]  Alternative.
[00:43:07.201 --> 00:43:07.822]  Alternative.
[00:43:07.862 --> 00:43:13.106]  And I feel like if Trump were to win, I wouldn't be able to express myself through my looks and everything.
[00:43:13.166 --> 00:43:17.289]  I wouldn't be able to have the piercings or the dyed hair or the tattoos that I want.
[00:43:17.629 --> 00:43:19.290]  I would be able to be myself.
[00:43:20.671 --> 00:43:22.672]  My dad's very pro-Trump and I'm just very...
[00:43:23.693 --> 00:43:25.814]  Oh my god, her poor father.
[00:43:26.054 --> 00:43:29.436]  I mean, the fact that she thinks she wouldn't even be able to have a piercing.
[00:43:44.403 --> 00:43:46.624]  If Donald Trump was elected, it's just asinine.
[00:43:46.804 --> 00:43:59.467]  You gotta keep in mind, folks, I believe that Donald Trump was the first president of the United States who actually went into office pro-gay marriage in favor of gay people being allowed to be married or their marriages recognized by the state.
[00:43:59.507 --> 00:44:04.849]  You can argue about whether or not it's a legitimate marriage on a religious standpoint, but from the perspective of the state,
[00:44:06.826 --> 00:44:07.988]  Gays are legally allowed to be married.
[00:44:08.008 --> 00:44:11.353]  Now, he was the first president that went into office pro-gay marriage.
[00:44:11.373 --> 00:44:14.879]  When Barack Obama went into office, he thought that marriage was between a man and a woman.
[00:44:14.899 --> 00:44:18.765]  When Hillary Clinton was in the Senate, she said that marriage was between a man and a woman.
[00:44:20.819 --> 00:44:44.694]  And for some reason the leftists are so brainwashed that they believe that the Republican Party or populism or Donald Trump himself are the antithesis of personal liberty when every single example of leftist versus Republican, true Republican, I'm not talking about rhinos or neocons who get us into war after war, every single example of policy goes to show that Republicanism
[00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:49.091]  Conservatism is actually the political philosophy of freedom.
[00:44:49.111 --> 00:45:03.035]  The only difference between Republican political philosophy and Democratic political philosophy, the only real difference, is that Republicans have failed to win the emotional argument.
[00:45:03.095 --> 00:45:15.098]  Obviously, there's stark differences in the outcomes of the policies themselves, but in terms of the eyes of the voters, everything that leftists say that they want, in terms of personal liberty and the ability to make decisions for themselves and freedom,
[00:45:16.809 --> 00:45:30.739]  Our policies that are far more supported by the Republican Party or true conservatism or true constitutional liberty, leftists only seek to impede and subjugate and impede and subjugate time and time again.
[00:45:30.759 --> 00:45:33.161]  I mean, here's a famous example.
[00:45:33.601 --> 00:45:46.090]  This week, former YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki dies at 56 of lung cancer after being warned repeatedly by Infowars, by others who tried to tell the truth on her platform and were censored, warned repeatedly
[00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:52.354]  That mRNA vaccines cause turbo cancer, that boosters cause turbo cancer, that the more vaccinated you are, the more likely you are to get cancer.
[00:45:52.595 --> 00:46:02.082]  She censors these videos for years, brags about wanting to take Alex Jones off the platform entirely, succeeds in doing so, and then dies of cancer.
[00:46:02.122 --> 00:46:06.545]  Maybe she should have listened to those who she censored because listening to that advice might have saved her life.
[00:46:06.605 --> 00:46:06.906]  Clip number 17.
[00:46:09.537 --> 00:46:17.105]  When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk, where do you want to see YouTube do better?
[00:46:17.806 --> 00:46:22.311]  Well, first of all, we've taken responsibility very seriously.
[00:46:22.952 --> 00:46:24.434]  It's been one of my top priorities.
[00:46:25.635 --> 00:46:30.541]  And with regard to COVID and with regard to vaccines, that has been a top priority for us.
[00:46:31.942 --> 00:46:35.845]  And we have we have a number of different ways that we address that.
[00:46:35.925 --> 00:46:42.009]  So first of all, we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID.
[00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:45.772]  Then if that's a violation of policies, then that's something that we'll remove.
[00:46:46.813 --> 00:46:49.715]  We removed over a million videos associated with COVID.
[00:46:50.476 --> 00:46:57.101]  But we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be that come from trusted and authoritative sources.
[00:46:57.521 --> 00:46:59.803]  And we've really been able to do that.
[00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:05.091]  Have you talked to the Biden administration at all about vaccine hesitancy or vaccine misinformation?
[00:47:06.024 --> 00:47:15.271]  Well, we did an event actually with the Biden administration, including President Biden himself, with a number of creators, Fauci as well.
[00:47:16.091 --> 00:47:31.262]  And we really saw that as an opportunity to be able to help and spread the information that was coming from the administration and coming from experts to using creators and those channels to be able to distribute authoritative, trusted information.
[00:47:31.482 --> 00:47:36.845]  I wonder if there's anything that you see in, you know, the way that anti-vaxxers behave on the platform.
[00:47:36.885 --> 00:47:42.588]  If there are any data or insights there that could be helpful to people understanding where they're coming from.
[00:47:42.608 --> 00:47:48.192]  I mean, we try to understand what are the different ways that we can break through.
[00:47:49.192 --> 00:47:54.237]  Um, so we talked about in this campaign that we did about getting back to the things that you love.
[00:47:54.778 --> 00:47:59.622]  Um, we talked about, we had people that represented all different backgrounds.
[00:47:59.682 --> 00:48:04.247]  We had people, like one of them was actually featuring, um, her mom.
[00:48:05.067 --> 00:48:06.569]  Well, there you go, folks.
[00:48:31.502 --> 00:48:32.503]  Unfortunately, she's dead.
[00:48:32.643 --> 00:48:33.563]  Unfortunately, she's dead.
[00:48:33.583 --> 00:48:36.685]  I don't wish harm to even these evil leftists.
[00:48:36.725 --> 00:48:37.685]  I feel bad for her family.
[00:48:37.705 --> 00:48:39.266]  She should be in our prayers.
[00:48:41.007 --> 00:48:54.574]  But this is the death of somebody who advocated misinformation and disinformation and censorship at the highest levels of the internet in the most influential platforms that exist on the planet.
[00:48:56.295 --> 00:48:57.275]  And censorship kills.
[00:48:57.375 --> 00:48:58.776]  It leads to death, ultimately.
[00:49:00.131 --> 00:49:04.054]  Keep in mind, no amount of lying can cover up the truth.
[00:49:04.615 --> 00:49:11.900]  And censorship can only serve, whether it has good intentions or not, it can either intentionally or inadvertently silence the truth only.
[00:49:12.541 --> 00:49:19.627]  Because the truth will always survive in the context of lies, so you don't need censorship to eradicate the lies and let the truth shine through.
[00:49:19.667 --> 00:49:24.851]  Censorship is only ever used for the purpose of censoring an inconvenient truth.
[00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:29.831]  Minimizing an inconvenient truth.
[00:49:30.472 --> 00:49:32.492]  Reducing an inconvenient truth.
[00:49:32.793 --> 00:49:39.796]  Silencing political opposition when they raise questions or make good points or make the case or argue for
[00:49:41.636 --> 00:49:49.041]  The reason that your political agenda or your policies are bad or failures or unjust or corrupt or criminal, that is the only purpose of censorship.
[00:49:49.101 --> 00:50:07.054]  And one of the best examples of this, one of the most outstanding examples of this, despite the pandemic and all the censorship that we saw there on virtually every platform, was the fact that even Mark Zuckerberg himself, when he went on Joe Rogan, bragged, didn't brag, admitted that the CIA called him, called Facebook personally, and warned them about the Hunter Biden laptop story.
[00:50:08.806 --> 00:50:14.390]  Gave them disinformation saying that the story was Russian misinformation.
[00:50:15.671 --> 00:50:18.313]  Caused them to censor everything before the last election cycle.
[00:50:18.613 --> 00:50:19.754]  We know that it's true now.
[00:50:19.994 --> 00:50:22.556]  We've been reporting on this for years that the laptop was true.
[00:50:22.576 --> 00:50:24.398]  We've been reporting the details of the laptop.
[00:50:25.037 --> 00:50:27.399]  For years as well, just as I showed you at the beginning of this show.
[00:50:27.679 --> 00:50:34.543]  The fact of the matter is, it was all real, and the corruption wasn't just example after example of Hunter Biden banging whores and using crack.
[00:50:35.084 --> 00:50:54.317]  It was example after example of how Hunter Biden created an investment firm, Rosemont Seneca, for the purpose of leveraging his position as the son of the Vice President of the United States to see inordinate gains in all of his investments, whether it's MetaBiota, which received $23.7 million after at least a half a million dollars from Rosemont Seneca was investment in it.
[00:50:55.117 --> 00:51:04.199]  Or this other corruption that we've seen come out this week and on my podcast two years ago and before that many times on the War Room and other platforms with this Romanian oligarch.
[00:51:05.159 --> 00:51:18.302]  So this level of censorship from this dead woman is an example of, whether it was intentional or not, the damage done when the truth is censored because you don't need to censor.
[00:51:19.304 --> 00:51:20.946]  Lies in order for the truth to prevail.
[00:51:21.166 --> 00:51:23.889]  But you have to censor truth in order for lies to prevail.
[00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:27.854]  That is the disproportionate injustice of a policy of censorship.
[00:51:28.114 --> 00:51:32.479]  It kills, it harms, it misinforms, and it brainwashes every single time.
[00:51:32.719 --> 00:51:33.921]  I would take a bullet
[00:51:35.575 --> 00:51:43.000]  For anyone's right to say anything, even if they were advocating for communism or things that I absolutely hate, Kamala Harris should be able to do a rally and advocate for depopulation.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:49.284]  We should fight against her advocacy for depopulation and genocide, but she should have a right to say what she wants, what she thinks.
[00:51:50.612 --> 00:52:02.882]  Because her right to say it is imperative because if I censor her, if we censor her, if we censor other opponents of the interests of the American people, it will always come back around to bite us and it will only harm the truth in the long term.
[00:52:03.062 --> 00:52:11.088]  And if we want humanity to live despite this globalist subjugation and genocide and depopulation of our people, then we have to fight censorship.
[00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:29.553]  What we are seeing across the United States is funded in large part by corporations engaging in Chinese slave labor and the notorious unchallenged usurpation strategy of George Soros.
[00:52:29.793 --> 00:52:37.915]  And like the sublime perfect masters of old, Soros will take nothing less than the collapse of the United States at any cost.
[00:52:38.255 --> 00:52:39.115]  President Trump
[00:52:40.174 --> 00:52:47.736]  He's a con man and the ultimate narcissist who wants the world to revolve around him.
[00:52:48.216 --> 00:53:09.800]  Soros' network is massive, where a league of outlaws fueled by an endless stream of funding, Marxist ideology and peer pressure answer to centralized radical left organizations that in turn receive public support from communist-leaning democratic leaders and mockingbird media, all tied into Soros' grand strategy.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.782]  They put us on a thing of syrup!
[00:53:13.363 --> 00:53:15.385]  Aunt Jemima!
[00:53:15.945 --> 00:53:16.646]  Miss Butterworth!
[00:53:16.686 --> 00:53:17.506]  Say her name!
[00:53:17.747 --> 00:53:19.108]  Miss Butterworth!
[00:53:19.268 --> 00:53:20.589]  Say her name!
[00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:32.339]  Portland, Oregon is ground zero, and its liberal mayor, Ted Wheeler, found out firsthand that his civil rights rhetoric is useless against the Marxist maelstrom.
[00:53:36.568 --> 00:53:40.553]  A egregious overreaction on the part of the federal officers.
[00:53:53.493 --> 00:54:00.638]  The president has been on a campaign now for some time against Democratic mayors across the country.
[00:54:01.118 --> 00:54:09.663]  Whether it's me, whether it's Keisha Lance Bottoms in Atlanta, whether it's Muriel Bowser in Washington, D.C., whether it's Jenny Durkan in Seattle.
[00:54:09.683 --> 00:54:11.605]  Do you see a common theme here?
[00:54:12.355 --> 00:54:15.137]  And our justice system is equally compromised.
[00:54:15.397 --> 00:54:24.344]  As Bloomberg reported, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said in a statement, This network of Marxist cultural revolutionaries, which is roughly 90% white, has fully exposed itself.
[00:54:24.364 --> 00:54:26.926]  It has hijacked a civil rights movement to engage in full-blown sedition.
[00:54:41.676 --> 00:54:49.558]  Men will recognize that out of one blood, God made all men well upon the face of the earth.
[00:54:49.958 --> 00:55:02.942]  Let us be dissatisfied until that day when nobody will shout white power, when nobody will shout black power, but everybody will talk about God's power and human power.
[00:55:03.582 --> 00:55:10.365]  Would Martin Luther King's movement of non-violence continue to march as innocent Americans died in its wake?
[00:55:10.685 --> 00:55:15.547]  As American small businesses were torched by MLK's followers?
[00:55:15.827 --> 00:55:17.408]  We all know the answer to that.
[00:55:17.568 --> 00:55:19.768]  It's an obvious, resounding no.
[00:55:22.088 --> 00:55:25.391]  We are going to have this kind of vigorous protest.
[00:55:25.451 --> 00:55:28.274]  My hope is that it will be non-violent.
[00:55:28.634 --> 00:55:34.760]  I would hope that we can avoid riots because riots are self-defeating and socially destructive.
[00:55:35.669 --> 00:55:48.783]  Let all those who are seething with anger and rage, who are starting to organize and think about life under a fascist regime, know that they are not alone and that there actually is a plan and a way to stop this.
[00:55:48.883 --> 00:55:53.688]  Regardless of the fact that they were in part formed by the Revolutionary Communist Party.
[00:55:53.928 --> 00:55:54.548]  In the studio!
[00:56:24.719 --> 00:56:25.841]  We have some good Americans.
[00:56:25.921 --> 00:56:35.196]  Carl Dix, co-initiator of Refused Fascism, representative of the Revolutionary Communist Party.
[00:56:35.577 --> 00:56:36.138]  How are you, sir?
[00:56:36.158 --> 00:56:37.380]  I'm feeling good, Richard.
[00:56:38.234 --> 00:56:43.796]  Because when I heard black voices for Trump, it reminded me of something.
[00:56:43.836 --> 00:56:48.158]  This is like having Jews for Adolf Hitler back in Nazi Germany.
[00:56:48.398 --> 00:56:48.818]  Damn!
[00:56:48.898 --> 00:57:00.062]  And we have known since 2017 that they are indirectly funded by the Alliance for Global Justice, which is listed as an organizer and fiscal sponsor for Refuse Fascism.
[00:57:00.202 --> 00:57:15.813]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser hosting the Alex Jones Show this evening for the next 54 minutes and then I'll be hosting Sunday Night Live for the next two hours.
[00:57:15.853 --> 00:57:18.255]  After that we will be taking your calls in the final hour of the show today.
[00:57:18.275 --> 00:57:19.275]  That's from 7 p.m.
[00:57:19.315 --> 00:57:20.436]  Central until 8 p.m.
[00:57:20.476 --> 00:57:20.816]  Central.
[00:57:21.137 --> 00:57:23.738]  So keep your phones close by because I want to hear from the listeners about all this.
[00:57:24.679 --> 00:57:29.920]  We've been berating Kamala Harris, and she deserves to be berated because she's evil and stupid.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:46.685]  Both of those things are incredibly dangerous, especially at this juncture in the world when World War III seems to be about ready to break out any moment, when our economy seems like it's going to collapse worse than 1929 at any moment, when our people are about to enter into a state of suffering we've never seen in these generations before.
[00:57:48.325 --> 00:58:04.525]  We cannot allow a subversive, corrupt, socialist, basically communist government to be in power when that happens because then our people will give over all of their liberties for sake of a little temporary safety, a little temporary relief.
[00:58:04.625 --> 00:58:07.089]  But a lot of people are attacking Joe Rogan this week.
[00:58:08.095 --> 00:58:10.537]  And I like Joe Rogan pretty much no matter what.
[00:58:10.577 --> 00:58:14.180]  I mean, if he flipped and became the full-on leftist, I would despise him.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.582]  But what we saw regarding his remarks this week about RFK Jr.
[00:58:17.602 --> 00:58:18.523]  did not surprise me.
[00:58:19.124 --> 00:58:22.066]  Because I know that he and RFK Jr.
[00:58:22.206 --> 00:58:24.268]  became very friendly after RFK Jr.
[00:58:24.308 --> 00:58:25.408]  was on his podcast.
[00:58:26.469 --> 00:58:32.053]  And I know that Joe Rogan endorsed, basically endorsed, Bernie Sanders in the last election cycle.
[00:58:32.074 --> 00:58:33.274]  So we know that he's not a Republican.
[00:58:33.294 --> 00:58:35.076]  He's never really been a Trump person.
[00:58:37.014 --> 00:58:42.076]  And we know that he's a left-leaning guy, so when I heard him come out and make all these comments about RFK Jr., he didn't endorse him.
[00:58:42.096 --> 00:58:44.157]  He walked it back, but it came off a lot like an endorsement.
[00:58:44.497 --> 00:58:45.297]  I wasn't surprised.
[00:58:45.337 --> 00:58:46.257]  I was disappointed.
[00:58:46.998 --> 00:58:47.718]  I disagree.
[00:58:47.738 --> 00:58:49.678]  I think that RFK Jr.
[00:58:49.739 --> 00:58:55.240]  is a CIA plant and only serves to weaken the Trump campaign against Kamala Harris, and so voting for RFK Jr.
[00:58:55.340 --> 00:59:05.104]  is, in fact, supporting, inadvertently, Kamala Harris, the most evil woman, perhaps, to ever set foot in the White House, aside from Hillary Clinton.
[00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:12.592]  But here's the clip number 34 where we see Joe Rogan make some friendly comments about RFK.
[00:59:12.612 --> 00:59:13.352]  We're going to run this.
[00:59:13.492 --> 00:59:14.892]  We're going to unpack it, analyze it.
[00:59:15.373 --> 00:59:19.254]  I think we should give Joe Rogan a little bit of grace because he's not going to be right every time.
[00:59:19.734 --> 00:59:22.695]  And he's been so directionally correct with his support for Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.055 --> 00:59:26.416]  Having him on his podcast right after he got that deal with Spotify was incredibly
[00:59:26.696 --> 00:59:28.317]  That's a risky and vulnerable thing for him to do.
[00:59:28.777 --> 00:59:34.600]  Supporting Alex Jones in his last comedy special when he said Alex Jones is often correct, is often right, was a bold thing to do.
[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:39.662]  This is not a bad person just because he is making a bad decision or making remarks that I believe are inaccurate.
[00:59:39.962 --> 00:59:41.503]  It doesn't make him an evil leftist.
[00:59:41.703 --> 00:59:47.445]  I was disappointed to see the right so quick to throw him into the volcano after these comments.
[00:59:47.945 --> 00:59:53.348]  We have to understand that there are leftists and then there are just sort of misguided people
[00:59:54.089 --> 01:00:00.365]  And I wouldn't generally say that Joe Rogan's a misguided person, but I do think that he is incorrect on the nature of RFK Jr.
[01:00:00.405 --> 01:00:01.568]  Let's see the clip and then unpack it. 34.
[01:00:03.186 --> 01:00:04.207]  That's just what they do.
[01:00:04.407 --> 01:00:05.167]  That's politics.
[01:00:05.287 --> 01:00:06.748]  They do it on the left, they do it on the right.
[01:00:06.808 --> 01:00:14.493]  They gaslight you, they manipulate you, they promote narratives, and the only one who's not doing that is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:00:14.793 --> 01:00:15.273]  You a fan?
[01:00:15.533 --> 01:00:16.454]  Yeah, I am a fan.
[01:00:16.854 --> 01:00:18.375]  Yeah, he's the only one that makes sense to me.
[01:00:18.435 --> 01:00:24.939]  He's the only one that, he doesn't attack people, he attacks actions and ideas, but he's
[01:00:26.636 --> 01:00:28.297]  He's much more reasonable and intelligent.
[01:00:28.517 --> 01:00:31.539]  I mean, the guy was an environmental attorney and cleaned up the East River.
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.020]  He's a legitimate guy.
[01:00:34.521 --> 01:00:42.706]  You know, before anybody started calling him an anti-vaxxer, which I thought he was too, I thought he was this nut, this like conspiracy theorist nut, until I read his book.
[01:00:43.226 --> 01:00:45.968]  I read The Real Anthony Fauci, and I'm like, what is...
[01:00:48.123 --> 01:00:48.924]  How much of this is real?
[01:00:49.264 --> 01:00:51.907]  Because if it's all real, this is fucking insane.
[01:00:52.087 --> 01:00:59.133]  And we live in a world where we're being manipulated by these health organizations that are being paid by the pharmaceutical drug interests.
[01:00:59.554 --> 01:01:10.003]  And these pharmaceutical drug companies are pumping these products out into the population and telling us that we need them, and then making insane amounts of money, and then...
[01:01:11.144 --> 01:01:12.686]  Also, the government is in on it.
[01:01:12.886 --> 01:01:15.768]  And also, they share a patent with Moderna.
[01:01:15.868 --> 01:01:18.231]  And also, they share profits.
[01:01:18.271 --> 01:01:28.200]  And there's 700 million dollars, 700... I mean, however much money was made, whatever the number is, that these guys made off of these products.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.402]  Like, this is, all of it is fucking crazy.
[01:01:30.442 --> 01:01:31.563]  There's the revolving door.
[01:01:32.103 --> 01:01:37.024]  Joe Rogan is absolutely right about the issues with Fauci, the issues with the vaccines, the issues with Big Pharma.
[01:01:37.084 --> 01:01:39.845]  But I think he's totally wrong about RFK Jr.
[01:01:39.865 --> 01:01:41.206]  You have to keep in mind that
[01:02:01.804 --> 01:02:02.544]  RFK Jr.
[01:02:02.664 --> 01:02:03.705]  only harms the Trump campaign.
[01:02:03.745 --> 01:02:13.569]  He's never gonna win himself, but he can help Kamala Harris win by polling votes away from Donald Trump because of so many Trump supporters being disappointed in Operation Warp Speed and Trump's position on the vaccines.
[01:02:14.109 --> 01:02:15.010]  That's the harm here.
[01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:18.151]  That, coupled with the fact that RFK Jr.'
[01:02:18.131 --> 01:02:24.494]  's campaign manager is former CIA, despite the fact that we know the CIA killed two members of RFK Jr.'
[01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:24.894]  's family,
[01:02:27.012 --> 01:02:31.013]  And not only is this person running his campaign, but she actually married into his family.
[01:02:31.053 --> 01:02:40.216]  So the CIA is his family now, running his campaign, pushing this candidate, supporting this candidate because they know that it only serves to weaken Donald Trump's position.
[01:02:40.236 --> 01:02:44.337]  So just like they tried to imprison him, just like they tried to prosecute him, just like they tried to assassinate him,
[01:02:44.517 --> 01:02:52.521]  They're also running an independent candidate, whether RFK even knows it or not, for the purpose of undermining the integrity and viability of the Trump campaign.
[01:02:52.741 --> 01:02:53.982]  And I wish Joe Rogan would see this.
[01:02:54.002 --> 01:02:56.943]  And I know that he sat down with them, and I know that the Kennedys are charming.
[01:02:56.963 --> 01:02:58.664]  They've always been charming people.
[01:02:58.924 --> 01:03:00.505]  Bill Clinton's a charming person, okay?
[01:03:00.525 --> 01:03:05.427]  I'm sure that if I sat down with Bill Clinton and I had a beer, he would charm the hell out of me.
[01:03:05.668 --> 01:03:08.189]  I would walk away still knowing that he's an evil rapist.
[01:03:09.482 --> 01:03:15.225]  But if I were to sit with him at this desk and have a conversation with him about politics, he would say some things that would be shockingly impressive.
[01:03:15.305 --> 01:03:16.005]  I guarantee it.
[01:03:16.045 --> 01:03:16.946]  Just like RFK Jr.
[01:03:17.246 --> 01:03:18.687]  says things that are shockingly impressive.
[01:03:18.727 --> 01:03:21.568]  Just like Barack Obama can say things that are shockingly impressive.
[01:03:21.848 --> 01:03:26.111]  Being charmed by these people is the same thing as being tricked by these people.
[01:03:26.131 --> 01:03:29.152]  And I don't know if RFK knows that he's CIA or not.
[01:03:29.192 --> 01:03:33.414]  I think he probably has an inkling, given the fact that the CIA is married into his family and running his campaign.
[01:03:33.695 --> 01:03:37.677]  But I do know that his candidacy is no good for this country whatsoever.
[01:03:38.342 --> 01:03:41.744]  Now does that make Joe Rogan an evil person because he's misguided and wrong?
[01:03:41.784 --> 01:03:42.144]  No!
[01:03:42.865 --> 01:03:47.807]  We have to separate those who have been tricked from those who do the tricking.
[01:03:48.708 --> 01:04:00.115]  It is the leftist political class that is lying to the people that is more culpable for the actions, for the political actions and policies, than it is the people who fall for the lie.
[01:04:00.135 --> 01:04:04.577]  If you fall for a lie from a political leader or a con artist or anybody else, you are a victim.
[01:04:04.617 --> 01:04:05.958]  Now you may be stupid, you may be
[01:04:06.218 --> 01:04:06.958]  We're good to go.
[01:04:23.939 --> 01:04:27.682]  So am I just going to write Joe Rogan off because I disagree with him about RFK Jr.?
[01:04:27.722 --> 01:04:28.963]  Maybe he's right and I'm wrong.
[01:04:29.243 --> 01:04:32.586]  I'm not going to write him off after all that he has done to promote freedom of speech.
[01:04:32.626 --> 01:04:48.079]  Keep in mind that if he would not have taken that Spotify deal in the midst of this pandemic that we just went through, this so-called pandemic over COVID-19, then he would have immediately been censored from YouTube about all of his claims regarding monoclonal antibodies, regarding ivermectin, regarding these vaccines.
[01:04:48.339 --> 01:04:52.022]  He would have been censored to hell in so many people.
[01:04:52.322 --> 01:05:04.266]  Millions upon millions of people never would have been awakened to the fact that something was terribly wrong about the narrative that was pushed by our own government, by the CDC, by Fauci, by the big pharmaceutical companies.
[01:05:04.766 --> 01:05:10.428]  Millions upon millions of people would have never been aware that something was terribly wrong about this pandemic if it wasn't for Joe Rogan.
[01:05:10.448 --> 01:05:17.910]  So just because he's wrong about a guy who's charming as hell that sat down with him and wrote a fantastic book, you're going to just totally write him off?
[01:05:19.056 --> 01:05:22.040]  I mean it seems to me that this is entirely reckless.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:26.867]  I was disappointed to see the right on social media just so brazenly attack him and he did walk it back.
[01:05:26.887 --> 01:05:31.934]  We're gonna run a clip number 58 here basically saying that a vote for RFK is a vote against Trump.
[01:05:31.974 --> 01:05:32.214]  Let's run 58.
[01:05:33.968 --> 01:05:39.230]  Well, I would vote for Trump before I'd vote for Biden, just because I think with Biden, like, he's no- he's- he's gone.
[01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:40.671]  Like, you know he's gone.
[01:05:40.731 --> 01:05:49.774]  It's- you're gonna be relying on his cabinet, and I knew his cabinet would be this f***ing sideshow of diversity, which is exactly what it is.
[01:05:49.854 --> 01:05:53.216]  You can't have those kind of people running a Ben and Jerry's.
[01:05:53.896 --> 01:05:58.718]  You- you certainly can't have those kind of people running the f- most powerful government the world's ever known.
[01:05:59.258 --> 01:06:01.759]  It's not- it's not- So, there you go.
[01:06:04.045 --> 01:06:06.746]  He's shown that Joe Biden is his least favorite candidate.
[01:06:06.966 --> 01:06:10.908]  He's just made the mistake of thinking that supporting or... He didn't endorse.
[01:06:10.928 --> 01:06:12.928]  He walked it back and said he's not formally endorsing anyone.
[01:06:12.948 --> 01:06:18.611]  I think probably because he saw how much harm it did to the Bernie Sanders campaign in 2016 when he offered that endorsement.
[01:06:19.711 --> 01:06:20.611]  Or was it 2020?
[01:06:20.792 --> 01:06:21.532]  God, I get them mixed up.
[01:06:22.272 --> 01:06:29.275]  They steal so many elections, they're all starting to seem the same to me in my mind, but... The fact of the matter is...
[01:06:30.822 --> 01:06:32.364]  Just because he's supporting RFK Jr.
[01:06:32.384 --> 01:06:35.827]  doesn't mean that he's not supporting Trump over Biden or Kamala Harris.
[01:06:35.887 --> 01:06:42.014]  And I know that Biden isn't even the candidate anymore and it's irrelevant to a certain extent, but we've got to give this guy a little grace.
[01:06:42.054 --> 01:06:43.535]  We're all going to make mistakes sometimes.
[01:06:43.735 --> 01:06:44.816]  I've made mistakes myself.
[01:06:44.897 --> 01:06:47.739]  I didn't even think that Russia was going to invade Ukraine until it happened.
[01:06:47.779 --> 01:06:50.763]  For weeks I was tweeting that it was never going to happen, that the Biden administration was lying.
[01:06:51.533 --> 01:07:03.507]  For a while there, I was disappointed in Trump and I wasn't going to support Trump because he made that true social post, that infamous one years ago, about how he thought temporarily we should throw out the Constitution if it means taking this country back.
[01:07:04.268 --> 01:07:05.429]  That's the way it read to me.
[01:07:05.529 --> 01:07:07.732]  People argue that's not what he meant or what he said.
[01:07:07.952 --> 01:07:11.156]  But I came out and said, gosh, I can't support him anymore if he's going to throw out the Constitution.
[01:07:12.037 --> 01:07:14.297]  And I've seen the light since then.
[01:07:14.317 --> 01:07:21.519]  I understand that not supporting Donald Trump is to support the death and homicide of the American people themselves.
[01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:23.959]  The death of this republic itself.
[01:07:24.239 --> 01:07:24.819]  I walked it back.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:25.680]  People change.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.080]  People get things wrong sometimes.
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:33.641]  He's getting this wrong not because he's bought off, or corrupt, or evil, or in on it, or controlled opposition.
[01:07:33.861 --> 01:07:37.282]  He's just falling for it because he hung out with the guy for three hours and he was charmed.
[01:07:38.208 --> 01:07:39.348]  It could happen to anybody.
[01:07:40.129 --> 01:07:41.229]  So give the guy a little grace.
[01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:43.570]  He's practically an American hero as far as I'm concerned.
[01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:54.453]  And as soon as we alienate and write good people off for making wrong decisions or interpreting the truth in an incorrect way, as soon as we write off good people, then we are lost.
[01:07:56.912 --> 01:07:57.833]  And that's the thing, folks.
[01:07:58.253 --> 01:08:06.017]  Our problems in this country are not about your neighbor on the left who votes for the Democrats or your neighbor on the right who votes for the Republicans.
[01:08:06.417 --> 01:08:11.240]  Our problems are not Democrats versus Republicans at the political class level, at the highest levels.
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:15.082]  Our problems are the people versus the political class.
[01:08:15.102 --> 01:08:23.326]  So if we're going to alienate our neighbors who are not themselves culpable or responsible for this exploitation of the American people just because we disagree with them,
[01:08:23.826 --> 01:08:31.529]  In the middle of an information war, when the whole purpose of this information war is to sow as much confusion as possible, then we are lost.
[01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:35.790]  There's a scene from The Patriot with Mel Gibson, one of the best movies of all time.
[01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:43.713]  I try to watch it every Fourth of July, where General Cornwallis is basically berating the antagonist in the movie, who played Draco Malfoy's father in Harry Potter.
[01:08:43.733 --> 01:08:44.754]  I can't remember the actor's name.
[01:08:45.174 --> 01:08:48.215]  He's saying, listen, if you continue to commit these war crimes,
[01:08:49.514 --> 01:08:52.595]  Then you're going to make the post-war world for us impossible.
[01:08:52.635 --> 01:08:58.758]  When this war is over, we as the English need to conduct and resume commerce with the American colonies.
[01:08:59.358 --> 01:09:04.420]  And you're committing war crimes against them, which is going to make it impossible for us to have capitalist success after this war is over.
[01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:05.481]  So stop with the war crimes.
[01:09:05.501 --> 01:09:06.001]  That's the whole point.
[01:09:06.441 --> 01:09:10.183]  We have to realize, as populist Americans,
[01:09:11.428 --> 01:09:21.295]  That we are going to have to have commerce and share communities with the American people, whether they're Democrats, whether they're Republicans, whether they're neocons, whether they're socialists.
[01:09:21.555 --> 01:09:24.297]  I'm talking about these voters who have been tricked.
[01:09:24.557 --> 01:09:31.341]  They have not themselves perpetrated the conning of the American people, perpetrated the corruption or the selling out of the American people.
[01:09:31.521 --> 01:09:38.086]  They have simply fallen for the lies that have been spewed at them incessantly for decades on mainstream media and by the political class itself.
[01:09:38.386 --> 01:09:39.127]  We cannot
[01:09:39.867 --> 01:09:43.228]  Berate them for being the victims of a con.
[01:09:43.508 --> 01:09:50.789]  We have to A. Enlighten them, B. Forgive them, and C. Accomplish total victory over this political class.
[01:09:50.829 --> 01:09:55.490]  So I'm not about to come out and talk crap about Joe Rogan for getting it wrong.
[01:09:55.510 --> 01:10:01.331]  I'm not going to come out and talk crap about Milo Yiannopoulos for saying things I disagree with about JD Vance.
[01:10:01.351 --> 01:10:05.551]  These are good people who I happen to disagree with, but directionally, they are very correct.
[01:10:05.631 --> 01:10:08.892]  And the net good from Joe Rogan is astounding.
[01:10:10.037 --> 01:10:18.921]  If it wasn't for him, I don't know that we would have seen the total death of the corporate media, of the legacy media, of the private political press.
[01:10:19.201 --> 01:10:31.246]  He single-handedly, him and Jamie, in a studio, accomplished more viewership than virtually all of the major corporate media networks combined every single episode that he comes out with.
[01:10:31.286 --> 01:10:31.986]  He killed them.
[01:10:32.006 --> 01:10:35.787]  That's why they have so much press against him because he's the competition.
[01:10:36.007 --> 01:10:39.889]  He's the reason people don't watch CNN at night anymore or Fox News at night anymore.
[01:10:39.949 --> 01:10:40.389]  We're good.
[01:10:55.734 --> 01:11:11.039]  He is responsible for the death of the organizations, corporations, and political elite most responsible for lying to the American people over the course of at least 50 years and getting us into every single war over the course of the last 50, 60, or 70 years.
[01:11:11.319 --> 01:11:13.559]  He killed them and so he's wrong about RFK Jr.
[01:11:13.599 --> 01:11:17.280]  and I'm gonna talk a bunch of crap about him and write him off and call him a podcast bro?
[01:11:17.721 --> 01:11:18.461]  Screw that!
[01:11:19.488 --> 01:11:22.751]  I just disagree with him on a simple thing as to whether or not RFK Jr.
[01:11:22.791 --> 01:11:25.413]  is a good candidate or a good person or a good person to support.
[01:11:25.593 --> 01:11:27.194]  That's a simple thing to disagree with him on.
[01:11:27.214 --> 01:11:29.135]  I'm not going to write him off over this.
[01:11:29.176 --> 01:11:30.056]  Are you ridiculous?
[01:11:31.898 --> 01:11:32.358]  He's wrong.
[01:11:32.398 --> 01:11:33.059]  We should educate him.
[01:11:33.079 --> 01:11:33.879]  We should enlighten him.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:35.540]  We should warn him.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.621]  We should share our perspective.
[01:11:36.641 --> 01:11:38.823]  He should consume it and think about it and consider it.
[01:11:38.843 --> 01:11:43.827]  But to write him off and attack him relentlessly over this just seems totally asinine.
[01:11:46.476 --> 01:11:48.337]  But ultimately, the sentiment is correct.
[01:11:48.778 --> 01:11:56.203]  The sentiment that supporting RFK serves only to benefit the Kamala Harris campaign is absolutely true.
[01:11:57.205 --> 01:11:59.707]  And we've seen clip after clip of how stupid she is.
[01:11:59.727 --> 01:12:03.969]  We've seen clip after clip in this very show of how corrupt and evil she is.
[01:12:03.989 --> 01:12:05.470]  So she's stupid and evil.
[01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:08.912]  And now we're seeing that she's actually a thief herself.
[01:12:08.972 --> 01:12:14.335]  In clip number eight, the Harris campaign just brazenly steals the no taxes on tips policy from Trump.
[01:12:14.596 --> 01:12:19.619]  Now she's actually pushing Trump policies because she understands that Trump's policies are better.
[01:12:19.659 --> 01:12:20.519]  This is clip number eight.
[01:12:20.639 --> 01:12:21.540]  Absolutely unbelievable.
[01:12:31.725 --> 01:12:32.266]  Unbelievable.
[01:12:33.427 --> 01:12:33.867]  Unbelievable.
[01:12:33.887 --> 01:12:41.634]  Kamala Harris announced a new policy of no taxes on tips for workers in the service industry, a policy Donald Trump has been promoting for months.
[01:12:43.016 --> 01:12:43.696]  She stole it from him.
[01:12:44.588 --> 01:12:46.290]  So now she's getting her policy ideas from Trump.
[01:12:46.951 --> 01:12:47.612]  Here's the question.
[01:12:47.872 --> 01:12:49.875]  She's currently the Vice President of the United States.
[01:12:50.155 --> 01:12:53.400]  She's currently a text away from the President of the United States, Joe Biden.
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:57.806]  I know he's on the beach just screwing around while his evil wife just reads a book next to him.
[01:13:00.063 --> 01:13:02.926]  But why is it that she doesn't just push that policy right now?
[01:13:03.526 --> 01:13:19.820]  Why does she have to wait until she's elected to apply a just policy at the legislative level, at the highest levels of our government, for the entirety of the population, for those most vulnerable among us who are forced to work three part-time jobs in Bidenomics, in Biden's economy, in order to make ends meet, whereas under the Trump?
[01:13:20.441 --> 01:13:21.101]  It's August right now.
[01:13:21.121 --> 01:13:23.043]  We've got August to September, September to October, October to November.
[01:13:23.063 --> 01:13:23.543]  That's three months.
[01:13:23.563 --> 01:13:25.544]  And then we've got November to December, December to January.
[01:13:25.844 --> 01:13:27.005]  That's another two months, basically.
[01:13:50.273 --> 01:13:54.354]  Where she's not going to be president yet, even if she wins, right?
[01:13:54.374 --> 01:13:55.655]  She'll be inaugurated in January.
[01:13:55.895 --> 01:13:57.756]  Why doesn't she do it now while she's in office?
[01:13:57.776 --> 01:13:59.496]  Why doesn't she make it happen right now?
[01:13:59.556 --> 01:14:12.181]  Well, it's because she wants to leverage and hold these good policies up just for the sake of causing these ignorant voters to salivate at the notion of Kamala Harris's heroic policies of tax relief for the most vulnerable communities among us.
[01:14:12.461 --> 01:14:15.362]  When she could solve the problem right now, she could lower
[01:14:16.584 --> 01:14:27.334]  That carrot that she's hanging and dangling over the voters right now, but she would rather have you suffer for the next five months if it means that she could accomplish political power and success and victory as a result.
[01:14:27.674 --> 01:14:34.040]  This is the philosophy, the mentality, the entire perspective of leftist political leaders.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:39.706]  They only do that which is politically expedient at the expense of that which is morally correct or just.
[01:14:41.579 --> 01:14:44.622]  Let's just tear into Tim Waltz for the next 30 minutes or so.
[01:14:58.507 --> 01:15:14.413]  And both of you, with your keen understanding of how this works, especially from National Guard families, I can tell you this, having been one of those that came back, we were in support of OEF, but being sitting in there with OEF, OIF veterans, when we came back, they showed us the horse whisperer and told us to be nice when we went home.
[01:15:14.953 --> 01:15:15.993]  And that was the extent of it.
[01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:16.413]  That was in 2004.
[01:15:16.534 --> 01:15:18.894]  I got PTSD just knowing who he is.
[01:15:18.954 --> 01:15:24.216]  Because of the people sitting in here and people who came before me, things have changed over the last four years.
[01:15:24.256 --> 01:15:25.396]  They have not changed enough.
[01:15:25.736 --> 01:15:32.858]  But Mr. Kennedy is following and moving something forward that the late senator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, advocated so clearly.
[01:15:32.918 --> 01:15:37.179]  Mental health, parity, and this issue of destigmatizing mental health, of understanding.
[01:15:37.219 --> 01:15:40.720]  And I, being in there and knowing as a first sergeant, know exactly what you're saying.
[01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:43.401]  And watching as people aren't trained on this, that there is
[01:15:44.741 --> 01:15:47.383]  There's a discrimination that goes against a soldier who has the courage.
[01:16:02.864 --> 01:16:10.346]  Taking a bullet for the United States of America, for the Republic, stood up and bravely said, fight, fight, fight, not lied about his service repeatedly.
[01:16:10.366 --> 01:16:18.967]  But here he is again, Tim Walz in clip number 49, just nodding along as he's being interviewed and the interviewers making claims about his service that are just brazenly false.
[01:16:19.187 --> 01:16:27.029]  Just Tim Walz nodding along, not correcting the record, exploiting stolen valor for the sake of political power.
[01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:30.930]  This is the philosophy of the left.
[01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.370]  Clip number 49.
[01:16:32.654 --> 01:16:32.734]  UGH!
[01:16:53.419 --> 01:17:03.321]  And I read that because I want to preface our discussion with your military careers because you two are trying to stop President Obama from drawing down the army.
[01:17:04.602 --> 01:17:05.982]  Unbelievable, he just nods along.
[01:17:06.802 --> 01:17:09.623]  Served in Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom.
[01:17:10.003 --> 01:17:10.583]  Just not true.
[01:17:11.063 --> 01:17:14.084]  And here's clip number 51 of Tim Waltz coming out and saying
[01:17:14.784 --> 01:17:16.645]  We want the government to mind their own damn business.
[01:17:16.665 --> 01:17:17.505]  Everybody's cheering.
[01:17:17.925 --> 01:17:26.489]  No wonder he wants everybody to mind their own business, because when you look into his military service records, it shows that he's lied for decades about the nature of that service.
[01:17:26.529 --> 01:17:31.431]  And frankly, he not only lied about his service, but he actually abandoned his own unit.
[01:17:32.341 --> 01:17:35.762]  Right before they were going to deploy into a war zone so he could run for Congress.
[01:17:35.782 --> 01:17:43.365]  So he would rather have power than serve his country in any capacity that could amount to any of his suffering or misery or death or violence or anything like that.
[01:17:43.385 --> 01:17:44.765]  He doesn't want to take a bullet for his country.
[01:17:44.985 --> 01:17:49.187]  He wants to send other young men to take a bullet for his political agenda.
[01:17:49.207 --> 01:17:49.527]  Clip number 51.
[01:17:49.567 --> 01:17:49.667]  Look!
[01:17:58.829 --> 01:18:04.115]  You and I, especially the gray hairs in the crowd, we know, we know our relatives.
[01:18:04.495 --> 01:18:08.239]  Republicans used to be the people talking about freedom.
[01:18:10.301 --> 01:18:11.142]  Not this group.
[01:18:11.682 --> 01:18:17.689]  When they talk about freedom, it means that the government should be free to invade your exam room with your doctor.
[01:18:22.659 --> 01:18:28.061]  Look, in Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make.
[01:18:28.622 --> 01:18:31.923]  We maybe wouldn't make the same choices, but we respect them.
[01:18:32.563 --> 01:18:38.866]  And I know in Minnesota and in Arizona and places across this country, you know what makes society work best?
[01:18:39.427 --> 01:18:40.707]  Is when you learn a golden rule.
[01:18:40.987 --> 01:18:42.108]  Mind your own damn business.
[01:18:42.128 --> 01:18:44.329]  Mind your own damn business.
[01:18:44.349 --> 01:18:44.769]  You don't need it.
[01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:56.681]  I don't need you telling me what books to read.
[01:18:56.701 --> 01:19:00.023]  I don't need you telling me about what religion we worship.
[01:19:00.603 --> 01:19:05.146]  And I sure the heck don't need you to tell me about my family.
[01:19:09.288 --> 01:19:10.109]  He's an evil liar.
[01:19:11.294 --> 01:19:12.955]  He is an evil liar.
[01:19:13.156 --> 01:19:18.460]  Now, one thing that might be different about him versus Kamala Harris is Kamala Harris is obviously very stupid.
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:22.364]  I'm not sure if Tim Waltz is stupid or not yet, but I am sure that he's an evil liar.
[01:19:23.124 --> 01:19:28.429]  Totally corrupt, committing stolen valor, advocating for minding your own business when we know that the leftist is the most
[01:19:29.867 --> 01:19:33.009]  Invasive political policy in the history of the United States of America.
[01:19:33.049 --> 01:19:34.609]  We know that he lets cities burn.
[01:19:34.930 --> 01:19:39.532]  That's why he wants us to mind our own business, so we can burn down the entire country without any political backlash.
[01:19:39.632 --> 01:19:41.273]  Stay with us for more on the other side, folks.
[01:19:49.731 --> 01:19:51.312]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:51.372 --> 01:19:58.278]  I am Chase Geyser, your host for the next 27 minutes and then the following two hours on our Sunday Night Live weekly broadcast.
[01:19:58.298 --> 01:20:01.000]  We have been tearing into Kamala Harris and Tim Waltz.
[01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:08.846]  It's very easy to do because there is clip after clip, policy after policy, and item after item that we can explore proving that they are evil, stupid,
[01:20:09.486 --> 01:20:09.646]  I think?
[01:20:39.386 --> 01:20:40.647]  We're good to go.
[01:20:52.419 --> 01:20:54.141]  Is your concern that it's... Oh, go ahead.
[01:20:54.181 --> 01:20:58.004]  But I do want to ask this question quickly, Sergeant Major, and I appreciate your time.
[01:20:59.185 --> 01:21:10.935]  But is your concern about the manner in which he did not speak to you or his decision to retire, which he, as we've talked about, he would have been entitled to do, which causes the most concern?
[01:21:10.955 --> 01:21:17.160]  Because that is the focus that so many people are wondering about, whether he has done something wrong... Is she wearing camouflage?
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.402]  First of all, this... Oh, my God, I haven't seen that.
[01:21:22.583 --> 01:21:25.767]  No, he did something wrong in services as stated before.
[01:21:25.787 --> 01:21:26.648]  He's like a floating head.
[01:21:27.788 --> 01:21:34.252]  He knew the policies and procedures and how we go to leadership and address issues or discuss issues and concerns out there.
[01:21:34.873 --> 01:21:37.595]  Again, backing up, he had told me, no, I'm going forward.
[01:21:37.935 --> 01:21:39.876]  We're going to go with the battalion and go from there.
[01:21:40.597 --> 01:21:42.958]  So I'm under the believing he told me he was going forward.
[01:21:43.018 --> 01:21:44.940]  I'm underneath that believing that he's going forward.
[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:50.063]  He went around me, which he should have addressed it with me so we could help do some things out there.
[01:21:50.864 --> 01:21:55.247]  Sergeant Major, this was really... Excuse me, I don't want to cut you off, sir.
[01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:56.668]  Finish your point, please, Sergeant Major.
[01:21:59.932 --> 01:22:11.700]  He went around me and the fact is that there's a possibility he probably would have realized I would have probably know it's too late you're going forward because we had already received our notice notification of sourcing and there's one other little
[01:22:13.877 --> 01:22:15.577]  He's trying to find a way to get him off the air.
[01:22:44.079 --> 01:22:44.839]  He was going forward.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:46.620]  Yeah, he knew he was going forward.
[01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:48.201]  Had he gotten his orders yet?
[01:22:48.661 --> 01:22:50.162]  No, at that time he had not.
[01:22:51.082 --> 01:23:02.128]  As far as being a command sergeant major, he, as soon as he retired, or I'm going to go with the term retired, which he did, which, and he was eligible after 20 years to get a full retirement.
[01:23:03.148 --> 01:23:05.309]  He was taken out of the academy at that time.
[01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:09.772]  Here's another thing about- Well, Sergeant Major, I do want to hear that.
[01:23:11.215 --> 01:23:12.896]  I do want to hear what you have to say, Sergeant Major.
[01:23:13.517 --> 01:23:17.860]  I know I want to be sensitive of your time and your audio is beginning to break up just a little bit.
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:18.841]  She just mixed that up.
[01:23:19.718 --> 01:23:20.599]  We're good to go.
[01:23:20.619 --> 01:23:21.139]  We're good to go.
[01:23:21.159 --> 01:23:21.479]  We're good to go.
[01:23:21.499 --> 01:23:21.879]  We're good to go.
[01:23:21.899 --> 01:23:22.260]  We're good to go.
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:22.720]  We're good to go.
[01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:23.300]  We're good to go.
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:23.761]  We're good to go.
[01:23:23.781 --> 01:23:24.341]  We're good to go.
[01:23:24.361 --> 01:23:24.741]  We're good to go.
[01:23:24.761 --> 01:23:25.161]  We're good to go.
[01:23:25.181 --> 01:23:25.562]  We're good to go.
[01:23:25.582 --> 01:23:25.942]  We're good to go.
[01:23:25.962 --> 01:23:26.282]  We're good to go.
[01:23:26.302 --> 01:23:26.642]  We're good to go.
[01:23:26.662 --> 01:23:27.043]  We're good to go.
[01:23:27.063 --> 01:23:27.483]  We're good to go.
[01:23:27.503 --> 01:23:28.103]  We're good to go.
[01:23:28.123 --> 01:23:28.684]  We're good to go.
[01:23:28.704 --> 01:23:29.384]  We're good to go.
[01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:29.885]  We're good to go.
[01:23:29.925 --> 01:23:30.385]  We're good to go.
[01:23:30.405 --> 01:23:30.885]  We're good to go.
[01:23:30.965 --> 01:23:32.066]  We're good to go.
[01:23:32.106 --> 01:23:32.506]  We're good to go.
[01:23:32.526 --> 01:23:33.387]  We're good to go.
[01:23:33.407 --> 01:23:33.987]  We're good to go.
[01:23:34.027 --> 01:23:34.407]  We're good to go.
[01:23:34.427 --> 01:23:35.308]  We're good to go.
[01:23:35.348 --> 01:23:35.688]  We're good to go.
[01:23:35.708 --> 01:23:36.529]  We're good to go.
[01:23:36.569 --> 01:23:37.269]  We're good to go.
[01:23:37.289 --> 01:23:38.010]  We're good to go.
[01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:38.850]  We're good to go.
[01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:39.651]  We're good to go.
[01:23:39.671 --> 01:23:40.191]  We're good to go.
[01:23:40.231 --> 01:23:40.952]  We're good to go.
[01:23:41.012 --> 01:23:41.192]  We're
[01:23:49.377 --> 01:23:50.078]  I don't know.
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:28.225]  Because of these false claims of stolen valor, now that we have a real example of actual documented stolen valor going on from Waltz over the course of decades, they're trying to undermine it and just totally ignore it and pretend it's a non-issue and it didn't even happen, yet they'll use the same exact point, the same exact issue erroneously on the right.
[01:24:28.325 --> 01:24:34.607]  This is the double standard, the injustice that is leftist political policy.
[01:24:35.447 --> 01:24:37.368]  Here in clip number 61, listen to what J.R.
[01:24:37.388 --> 01:24:38.768]  Majewski has to say about his experience.
[01:24:41.261 --> 01:24:45.685]  Why is the Kamala Harris campaign attacking me on Twitter?
[01:24:47.006 --> 01:24:47.627]  I'll tell you why.
[01:24:48.447 --> 01:24:56.074]  Because Kamala's vice presidential nominee, her running mate, well, he's been accused of committing stolen valor.
[01:24:56.094 --> 01:24:57.035]  That's right.
[01:24:57.655 --> 01:25:08.805]  Tim Walz, who was in the army, has repeatedly throughout his career lied and insinuated that he deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq
[01:25:09.639 --> 01:25:11.040]  During Operation Enduring Freedom.
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:14.021]  And, well, the records don't show that.
[01:25:14.601 --> 01:25:22.325]  And he's actually said that he's, well... Make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.
[01:25:22.665 --> 01:25:25.726]  I, on the other hand, well, I was endorsed by President Trump and J.D.
[01:25:25.766 --> 01:25:26.106]  Vance.
[01:25:27.047 --> 01:25:32.909]  And I was on my way to defeating a 40-year Democratic incumbent in a congressional race.
[01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:36.131]  And the Democratic Party lied about me.
[01:25:36.897 --> 01:25:48.564]  They stole my military records, they forged my signature, and they fabricated a story about me saying that I never served in Afghanistan because I didn't have a medal that wasn't even created while I was in the military.
[01:25:49.125 --> 01:25:50.986]  Now, J.R., you know, they hit J.R.
[01:25:51.026 --> 01:25:52.407]  very hard, I have to tell you.
[01:25:52.467 --> 01:25:53.367]  These are friends of mine.
[01:25:54.168 --> 01:25:54.548]  J.R.
[01:25:54.568 --> 01:26:00.772]  was a hero and is a hero, and they hit him very hard with false stuff that he wasn't a hero.
[01:26:01.172 --> 01:26:02.093]  This candidate, J.R.
[01:26:02.113 --> 01:26:05.215]  Majewski, has misrepresented his military record.
[01:26:06.690 --> 01:26:08.934]  And after the election, they found out he was.
[01:26:09.596 --> 01:26:09.896]  J.R.
[01:26:09.916 --> 01:26:13.964]  Majewski gave Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur one of her tightest races in 2022.
[01:26:14.605 --> 01:26:17.371]  I was attacked by a political machine.
[01:26:23.733 --> 01:26:29.897]  News Eye team has confirmed that the Air Force recently awarded him the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.
[01:26:30.057 --> 01:26:34.039]  How much do you think the military document issue played a role in the race?
[01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:37.161]  It was significantly impactful.
[01:26:37.341 --> 01:26:46.087]  This is the reality of politics and the American citizen should not have to be dissuaded from running for politics because of this.
[01:26:47.771 --> 01:26:52.617]  And on behalf of our country, I'd like to apologize to J.R.
[01:26:52.677 --> 01:26:54.980]  Majewski, because you were treated very unfairly.
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:56.182]  So, okay?
[01:26:56.822 --> 01:26:58.324]  You were treated very unfairly.
[01:26:58.625 --> 01:27:01.048]  But he is a hero, and everybody now knows it.
[01:27:01.228 --> 01:27:02.509]  Thank you, J.R., very much.
[01:27:02.529 --> 01:27:03.471]  Appreciate it.
[01:27:04.571 --> 01:27:09.333]  And they did lie about his stolen valor in order to undermine his candidacy, because that's what leftists do.
[01:27:09.373 --> 01:27:20.996]  They lie when it's convenient, they advocate for democracy when it's convenient, and then they totally subvert democracy when it's inconvenient by just ushering in a new candidate and blackmailing the candidate who actually received the votes in the primary.
[01:27:21.016 --> 01:27:25.917]  I mean, this is unbelievable, the level of gaslighting we're seeing from the left.
[01:27:26.017 --> 01:27:27.798]  It is akin to like Soviet-level stuff.
[01:27:27.878 --> 01:27:29.518]  It is CCP-level stuff.
[01:27:29.538 --> 01:27:31.359]  Frankly, these folks are all communists.
[01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:32.319]  They're evil communists.
[01:27:32.899 --> 01:27:34.080]  At least we have people like J.D.
[01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:37.301]  Vance and Trump who are willing to come out and call them on their crap.
[01:27:38.022 --> 01:28:02.235]  I just hope the American people have the wisdom and prudence and character to interpret the truth of objective reality rather than just continue to live in their brainwashed stagnant state of this BS anti-fascist mentality thinking that a vote for Donald Trump is somehow a vote for fascism when we see example after example from the left of how their policies are literally fascist.
[01:28:02.515 --> 01:28:17.363]  When they're pressuring major tech platforms like Twitter, like Instagram, like Facebook, like Snapchat, like YouTube and others, using the CIA, they're pressuring these organizations, these private businesses, to censor and violate your First Amendment rights to freedom of speech.
[01:28:17.883 --> 01:28:18.764]  That is fascism!
[01:28:19.184 --> 01:28:33.956]  When the central government has so much leverage and control over private business that it can weaponize the private sector against its own people for the sake of achieving a political agenda at the expense of the rights, interests, wants, and needs of its own people, that is fascism.
[01:28:33.996 --> 01:28:39.760]  So I'm telling you right now that if you're not voting for Donald Trump because you think he's fascist, take a look at these leftist policies.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:45.645]  Take a long, hard, close look at which policy was the one responsible for mask mandates.
[01:28:45.925 --> 01:28:48.067]  Which party was the one responsible
[01:28:48.547 --> 01:28:49.067]  I don't know.
[01:29:13.285 --> 01:29:17.247]  Imprisonment and persecution of political opponents comes exclusively from the left.
[01:29:17.527 --> 01:29:20.348]  The fact that Edward Snowden had to flee to Russia came from the left.
[01:29:20.388 --> 01:29:26.711]  The fact that Julian Assange was stuck in an embassy for years, imprisoned for years unjustly, came from the left.
[01:29:26.791 --> 01:29:28.792]  And now these wars are coming from the left.
[01:29:28.852 --> 01:29:30.433]  This war in Ukraine is from the left.
[01:29:30.693 --> 01:29:33.054]  This war between Israel and Hamas is from the left.
[01:29:33.314 --> 01:29:36.296]  This tension between China and Taiwan is from the left.
[01:29:37.657 --> 01:29:44.181]  We have conflict after conflict, economic crisis after economic crisis, and injustice after injustice, all from the left.
[01:29:44.241 --> 01:29:47.764]  I put to you now, the left is fascist, actually fascist.
[01:29:47.784 --> 01:30:07.357]  So if you're anti-fascist, if you think that you're standing up for individual rights and justice and tolerance and acceptance of communities and the government staying out of your business, then you better think again if you're planning on voting for Kamala Harris, because this is a woman who brags about the fact that with a flick of her pen, she could imprison anybody with a misdemeanor charge that she has this power.
[01:30:08.137 --> 01:30:17.924]  She brags about her policies of keeping people in prison in California beyond the length of their sentence so that they could be used as slave labor.
[01:30:19.064 --> 01:30:24.668]  She brags about how great the border is when it's sponsored the invasion of our people.
[01:30:24.708 --> 01:30:35.155]  She claims to be an advocate for victims of sexual assault while she's allowed tens of millions of people to come into the United States illegally, many of them from terrorist countries, many of them committing robberies, murders, and rapes.
[01:30:37.222 --> 01:30:40.766]  She brags about imprisoning people for small marijuana charges.
[01:30:40.786 --> 01:30:46.171]  She brags about arresting and charging single mothers for their truant children in California.
[01:30:46.211 --> 01:30:47.192]  You realize she did that, right?
[01:30:47.232 --> 01:30:51.296]  When, you know, in California, you have to work three jobs as a single mom in order to make ends meet remotely.
[01:30:52.315 --> 01:31:02.345]  And sometimes when you're working three jobs as a single mom, you lose track of what your kid's doing, or maybe since dad isn't around, your kid's starting to act up and you don't know it, and you're the one that's going to be prosecuted for this situation.
[01:31:02.605 --> 01:31:05.548]  This is the type of world that Kamala Harris believes in.
[01:31:05.668 --> 01:31:13.956]  She is abundantly evil, and she is the embodiment and the manifestation of all leftist idealism and policy, and she is a fascist.
[01:31:13.976 --> 01:31:16.298]  She's a fascist and a communist at the same time.
[01:31:17.574 --> 01:31:23.516]  In the 20th century, it was the fascists who actually put down the communists in Germany, and the fascists ended up being evil.
[01:31:23.536 --> 01:31:25.717]  The communists ended up being even more evil.
[01:31:25.737 --> 01:31:27.837]  We see this from the Great Leap Forward and from the Holocaust.
[01:31:28.097 --> 01:31:41.842]  Millions upon millions die from both fascism and communism, but what these new globalists have done, the Kamala Harrises and the Joe Bidens and the Soroses and others, what they have done is they have somehow figured out a way to merge that which was incompatible into a new compatible form.
[01:31:42.082 --> 01:31:50.426]  They have merged fascism with communism into one singular political movement and philosophy and they call it globalism or they call it progressivism.
[01:31:51.267 --> 01:31:52.467]  They call it unity.
[01:31:52.487 --> 01:31:53.508]  They call it tolerance.
[01:31:53.768 --> 01:31:54.909]  They give it all these names.
[01:31:55.129 --> 01:32:01.032]  But what it is, is the worst of fascism coupled with the worst of communism all in one political ideal.
[01:32:01.352 --> 01:32:02.793]  That is what we are witnessing right now.
[01:32:02.893 --> 01:32:06.815]  And I think JD Vance did a great job of putting it to
[01:32:09.278 --> 01:32:13.225]  Putting the truth out there on CNN in combating Kamala Harris and Tim Waltz.
[01:32:13.245 --> 01:32:16.130]  Let's run clips three and four back-to-back as one clip.
[01:32:16.150 --> 01:32:17.532]  This is clips three and four.
[01:32:17.873 --> 01:32:23.001]  Watch as JD Vance shreds fundamentally fake Kamala Harris and Tim Waltz in CNN interview.
[01:32:23.953 --> 01:32:28.134]  Dana, I criticized his lying about his own record, okay?
[01:32:28.494 --> 01:32:32.815]  This is a guy who was captured on video saying, I carried a gun in war.
[01:32:32.995 --> 01:32:33.935]  He never went to war.
[01:32:34.275 --> 01:32:46.478]  This is a guy who's been captured on video as other people say, he's an Afghanistan veteran, he's a veteran of a war, nodding along in agreement instead of saying, no, no, no, I did serve my country, I did it honorably, but I never went to a war zone.
[01:32:46.758 --> 01:32:49.159]  I'm not criticizing Tim Walz's service.
[01:32:49.579 --> 01:32:53.821]  I'm criticizing the fact that he lied about his service for political gain, Dana.
[01:32:53.941 --> 01:32:57.282]  Now ask me three questions about comments that I made three years ago.
[01:32:57.882 --> 01:33:03.105]  I wonder what Kamala Harris thinks about the fact that she supported policies that opened the American Southern border.
[01:33:03.125 --> 01:33:08.587]  I wonder what Kamala Harris thinks about the fact that she lied to the American people about Joe Biden's middle...
[01:33:09.167 --> 01:33:09.547]  I don't know.
[01:33:29.165 --> 01:33:30.466]  How are we going to lower inflation?
[01:33:30.726 --> 01:33:33.068]  How are we going to reduce the cost of food and housing?
[01:33:33.108 --> 01:33:34.750]  How are we going to close down that southern border?
[01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:36.491]  We've talked so little about that.
[01:33:36.751 --> 01:33:39.814]  We've talked a lot more about a sarcastic remark I made three years ago.
[01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:42.416]  I think we should talk about the issues that most Americans care about.
[01:33:42.476 --> 01:33:45.118]  Kamala Harris is whatever she says she is.
[01:33:45.579 --> 01:33:49.082]  But I believe, importantly, that President Trump is right that she's a chameleon.
[01:33:49.482 --> 01:33:51.784]  She pretends to be one thing in front of one audience.
[01:33:51.824 --> 01:33:54.046]  She pretends to be something different in front of another audience.
[01:33:54.386 --> 01:33:57.109]  Look, Dana, she's not running a political campaign.
[01:33:57.490 --> 01:33:59.212]  She's running a movie.
[01:33:59.532 --> 01:34:01.735]  She only speaks to voters behind a teleprompter.
[01:34:02.176 --> 01:34:03.117]  Everything is scripted.
[01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:04.939]  She doesn't have her policy positions out there.
[01:34:05.259 --> 01:34:08.203]  She hasn't answered why she wanted to ban fracking, but now she doesn't.
[01:34:08.443 --> 01:34:10.205]  She wanted to fund police, but now she doesn't.
[01:34:10.465 --> 01:34:12.468]  She wanted to open the border, but now she doesn't.
[01:34:12.868 --> 01:34:20.132]  She should have to answer for why she presents a different set of policies to one audience and a different set of policies to another audience.
[01:34:20.393 --> 01:34:22.034]  And I think that's what President Trump is getting at.
[01:34:22.074 --> 01:34:23.735]  This is a fundamentally fake person.
[01:34:24.035 --> 01:34:25.696]  She's different depending on who she's in front of.
[01:34:26.276 --> 01:34:28.737]  I criticize people for not having kids.
[01:34:29.138 --> 01:34:31.419]  I criticize people for being anti-child.
[01:34:31.479 --> 01:34:32.920]  And I do think that Kamala Harris...
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:35.261]  If you're pro-abortion and you're pro-depopulation, you're inherently anti-child.
[01:34:35.281 --> 01:34:36.022]  He's absolutely right.
[01:34:36.042 --> 01:34:40.084]  The fact that the CNN anchor couldn't even see this is just... I can't even fathom the audacity, the stupidity of it.
[01:34:59.241 --> 01:35:00.222]  Go back to the COVID era.
[01:35:00.322 --> 01:35:01.923]  One thing that really frustrated me, please.
[01:35:01.983 --> 01:35:03.064]  Are you going to debate Tim Walz?
[01:35:03.185 --> 01:35:03.525]  Of course.
[01:35:03.665 --> 01:35:04.626]  I want to debate Tim Walz.
[01:35:04.686 --> 01:35:05.567]  I think it's important.
[01:35:05.627 --> 01:35:10.371]  And I think that it goes to a very fundamental difference between the Trump fans ticket and our opposition.
[01:35:10.711 --> 01:35:12.693]  We believe in talking to the media.
[01:35:12.953 --> 01:35:14.235]  We believe in answering questions.
[01:35:14.335 --> 01:35:15.396]  We believe in debating.
[01:35:15.716 --> 01:35:16.697]  I think it's really important.
[01:35:17.077 --> 01:35:20.700]  I mean, look, I'm asking the American people to make me their vice president.
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:27.746]  It's really important to stand before the American people to make that case, and I'm going to keep on doing it in whatever form I get the opportunity.
[01:35:27.766 --> 01:35:28.567]  We look forward to it.
[01:35:28.647 --> 01:35:30.688]  Thank you so much for sitting down and taking my questions.
[01:35:30.708 --> 01:35:31.469]  He's absolutely right.
[01:35:31.489 --> 01:35:32.770]  Kamala Harris is totally fake.
[01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:33.791]  Tim Walz is totally fake.
[01:35:33.851 --> 01:35:40.997]  I mean, we just went over the fact that she's stealing Trump's policy for no tax on tips, and this is just hitting the desk, busted.
[01:35:41.077 --> 01:35:43.719]  Biden admin imposed a new tax scheme on tips.
[01:35:44.099 --> 01:35:56.823]  Before copycat Kamala stole Trump's no-tax-on-tips plan, the Biden administration rolled out a new tax rule on service industry tips over a year before Kamala Harris stole former President Trump's proposal to eliminate taxes on tips.
[01:35:57.203 --> 01:36:07.446]  Shortly after Trump in June unveiled his proposal to abolish taxes on tips earned by service industry and hospitality workers, Harris announced on Saturday in Las Vegas that she would do the same if elected in November.
[01:36:08.026 --> 01:36:11.427]  Trump, of course, lambasted Harris on True Social for blatantly stealing his policy
[01:36:11.527 --> 01:36:11.827]  I don't know.
[01:36:30.444 --> 01:36:46.218]  So, if we're going to have Kamala Harris as President of the United States and she's going to make false claims about wanting to adopt Trump policies, even though she could actually work right now as the Vice President of the United States to implement these policies, then how are we supposed to expect her to handle our foreign policy any better?
[01:36:46.539 --> 01:36:52.604]  How are we supposed to expect her not to sell us out to foreign interests when she's selling us out to her own interests right now?
[01:36:52.624 --> 01:36:55.587]  I mean, we have a World War III watch happening right now.
[01:36:56.067 --> 01:37:03.832]  Here at Infowars, as Russia begins heavy retaliation on Ukrainian capital as Zelensky breaks silence on the Kursk invasion.
[01:37:04.093 --> 01:37:15.941]  And I just want to show you what our own defense industry department is saying, what our own intelligence community is saying, what our own military industrial complex is saying about this escalation happening between Russia and Ukraine.
[01:37:16.141 --> 01:37:17.142]  This is clip number 20.
[01:37:17.482 --> 01:37:23.466]  But now in the sixth day of the Kursk invasion, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who I like to refer to as Voldemort Zelensky,
[01:37:23.846 --> 01:37:30.727]  Explained the following on Sunday breaking his silence and giving his first official confirmation of the daring cross-border ground operation He says quote today.
[01:37:30.767 --> 01:37:49.211]  I received several reports from commander-in-chief Sir skele, excuse me regarding the front lines and our actions to push the war onto the aggressors territory at it Ukraine is proving that it can indeed restore justice and ensure the necessary pressure on the aggressor But this is clip number 20 of our own intelligence military community responding to this escalation.
[01:37:49.231 --> 01:37:49.251]  I
[01:37:50.595 --> 01:37:51.055]  Yeah, thanks.
[01:37:51.095 --> 01:38:00.943]  So just on the Ukraine attacks into Russia, are you concerned that Russia will escalate tensions over this attack, including with the U.S., nuclear threats, anything like that?
[01:38:02.485 --> 01:38:08.349]  No, because at the end of the day, Ukraine is fighting for its sovereign territory that its neighbor invaded.
[01:38:08.810 --> 01:38:18.157]  So if we want to de-escalate tensions, as we've said from the beginning, the best way to do that is Putin can make that decision today to withdraw troops from Ukraine.
[01:38:20.399 --> 01:38:35.727]  Ukraine is going to do everything it can to continue to take back its sovereign territory, and that's what we're seeing they're doing in this, what you're referring to in this, you know, Kursk Oblast.
[01:38:35.747 --> 01:38:42.191]  We're going to continue to support Ukraine with the capabilities and the systems that they need.
[01:38:42.931 --> 01:38:45.212]  We don't feel like this is escalatory in any way.
[01:38:45.872 --> 01:38:48.554]  Ukraine is doing what it needs to do to be successful on the battlefield.
[01:38:50.009 --> 01:38:50.509]  Unbelievable.
[01:38:50.529 --> 01:38:51.009]  Now this is clip 18.
[01:38:51.089 --> 01:38:53.950]  I want to throw this up and I'll talk over it because it may be b-roll.
[01:38:54.611 --> 01:39:04.314]  But this is, this is video of these escalations, these Russian targets in clip number 18 being hit by Ukraine offenses.
[01:39:04.594 --> 01:39:11.177]  And the more we fund this, the more weapons we give them, the more soldiers we give them, the more problematic this is, this is going to be for us.
[01:39:11.217 --> 01:39:13.778]  I mean, this is, this is definitely an escalation into World War III.
[01:39:15.828 --> 01:39:22.679]  When you have Russian Territory, Sovereign Territory, Sovereign Territory being attacked by Ukrainian Nazis.
[01:39:22.979 --> 01:39:25.804]  Nazis who we gave 63, what was it, 63 billion dollars?
[01:39:28.527 --> 01:39:35.832]  On Hitler's birthday this year, I am just sick and tired of our own government, our own political class, continuing to sell us out.
[01:39:36.373 --> 01:39:40.776]  And it's not just that they're selling us out or compromising our interests for a little bit of kickback here and there.
[01:39:40.816 --> 01:39:42.597]  It's not a minuscule amount of corruption.
[01:39:42.617 --> 01:39:50.363]  You have to keep in mind, the more powerful the federal government becomes, the more painful and felt corruption is at the highest levels.
[01:39:50.403 --> 01:39:57.648]  Back in, you know, the 19th century in the United States of America, the federal government was much less powerful than it is today.
[01:39:58.248 --> 01:40:00.189]  It's not that people were less corrupt back then.
[01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:02.189]  People have always been the same level of corrupt.
[01:40:02.409 --> 01:40:07.430]  But the more powerful and control a government has, the more that corruption is felt by the people.
[01:40:07.450 --> 01:40:13.932]  Whether it's a fascist government, whether it's a communist government, the more control this government has, the more painful corruption becomes.
[01:40:14.012 --> 01:40:17.553]  And now we are arriving at a place where our government is so abundantly powerful,
[01:40:17.913 --> 01:40:18.093]  I'm good.
[01:40:41.015 --> 01:40:41.455]  We're good to go.
[01:41:04.281 --> 01:41:07.664]  That there's more and more evidence coming out that our very own elections aren't even democratic.
[01:41:07.744 --> 01:41:12.308]  Our own democratic processes in our constitutional republic are totally undermined.
[01:41:12.328 --> 01:41:18.214]  We've got Smartmatic Voting Machines president and two executives indicted on bribery, money laundering charges.
[01:41:18.234 --> 01:41:18.834]  This is clip number 35.
[01:41:18.894 --> 01:41:30.285]  The co-founder and president of electronic voting machine company Smartmatic, Roger Alejandro Piñata Martinez, was indicted on Thursday along with two other executives and a former chairman of the Commission of Elections.
[01:41:32.466 --> 01:41:47.272]  Smartmatic has provided election technology and support services in Venezuela since 2004.
[01:41:49.493 --> 01:41:59.638]  Even in moments of deep political conflict and division, we have been satisfied that the voting process and the count has been completely accurate.
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:14.631]  It is therefore with the deepest regret that we have to report that the turnout numbers on Sunday 30th of July for the Constituent Assembly in Venezuela were tampered with.
[01:42:15.051 --> 01:42:26.140]  Based on the robustness of our system, we know without any doubt that the turnout of the recent election for a National Constituent Assembly was manipulated.
[01:42:26.801 --> 01:42:30.084]  It is important to highlight that similar manipulations
[01:42:31.027 --> 01:42:31.608]  We're good to go.
[01:42:54.875 --> 01:42:57.517]  To make it evident when results are manipulated.
[01:42:58.117 --> 01:43:02.841]  However, there must be people auditing the system and watching for that evidence.
[01:43:03.982 --> 01:43:11.848]  During the National Constituent Assembly elections, there were no auditors from the opposition parties, as they did not want to participate.
[01:43:14.209 --> 01:43:16.691]  So how do you come up with the one million?
[01:43:17.332 --> 01:43:21.535]  An audit would allow everyone to know the exact participation.
[01:43:22.887 --> 01:43:29.750]  We estimate the difference between the actual participation and the one announced by the authorities is at least one million votes.
[01:43:31.831 --> 01:43:39.414]  It is important to point out that this would not have occurred if the auditors of all political parties... So we know that these machines are a major risk.
[01:43:39.694 --> 01:43:44.176]  And it's dangerous to say anything about it because you're liable to get sued by Dominion or Smartmatic or these other companies.
[01:43:44.216 --> 01:43:47.017]  I mean, that's basically the reason that Tucker Carlson is no longer at Fox News.
[01:43:47.297 --> 01:43:49.418]  Of course, it backfired and he's more powerful now than ever.
[01:43:51.377 --> 01:43:58.482]  But speaking of lawsuits and attempts to silence the truth, I want to encourage everyone to go to InfoWarsStore.com right now.
