[00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:03.472]  History is happening now.
[00:00:03.892 --> 00:00:12.480]  26 governors have now combined forces against Joe Biden and the globalists and their attempt to end our border and end American sovereignty.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.581]  History's happening right now.
[00:00:15.302 --> 00:00:21.047]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:23.709]  InfoWars.com forward slash go.
[00:00:27.096 --> 00:00:30.597]  Well, as Ron Paul would famously say, it's happening.
[00:00:31.717 --> 00:00:41.100]  26 states, including Texas, are now standing against the tyrant Joe Biden's disillusion of the southern U.S.
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.460]  border.
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:54.775]   And Biden's announcement that he wants to seize control of the state guard, not so They can stop an invasion, but so that they will not stop an invasion.
[00:00:55.355 --> 00:01:00.079]  This is so historical, and by the hour, more states are joining us.
[00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:04.343]  In fact, some expect Democrats to now join this.
[00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:10.508]  Every Republican governor has now joined Greg Abbott, Rhonda Santos, all of them.
[00:01:10.888 --> 00:01:17.286]   The governor of Florida, the governor of Virginia, the governor of Arkansas, the list goes on and on.
[00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:19.127]  This is a historic moment.
[00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:25.770]  It's in the Constitution, the right to self-defense, massive human smuggling, sex trafficking.
[00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.710]  It's all happening.
[00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:37.817]   And now, peacefully, We see the state standing up against Joe Biden, who told illegal aliens, when I win the election, immediately surge the border.
[00:01:38.578 --> 00:01:42.802]  What I would do as president is several more things, because things have changed.
[00:01:43.222 --> 00:01:47.886]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[00:01:48.267 --> 00:01:49.908]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[00:01:50.168 --> 00:01:51.149]  They deserve to be heard.
[00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:51.970]  That's who we are.
[00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:56.349]   where a nation says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:00.829]   I would change the order that the president just changed saying women who were being beaten and
[00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.390]  abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum.
[00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.750]   So we'll continue to track all of this at Infowars.com/show and on my broadcast tomorrow we're going
[00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.750]   to be getting into great detail on all this the Friday edition of the show.
[00:02:15.127 --> 00:02:17.948]  But this has the power structure in full panic.
[00:02:18.408 --> 00:02:37.131]  If I was a globalist, I would stage an attack on migrants somewhere on the border to demonize this opposition because this is really illustrating the treason that's going on and the ongoing impeachment proceedings against Alejandro Mayorkas, the head of DHS, and all the other incredible developments that are happening.
[00:02:37.811 --> 00:02:38.931]  This is what it's all about.
[00:02:39.252 --> 00:02:49.415]  The states coming together, the people coming together, not to dissolve the republic, it's the UN-run globalist government that's doing that, but to reconstitute our republic.
[00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:51.255]  It's in the Declaration of Independence.
[00:02:51.295 --> 00:02:52.276]  It's in the Constitution.
[00:02:52.696 --> 00:02:53.676]  It's in the Bill of Rights.
[00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:57.497]  It's not just our right, it's our duty to defend ourselves.
[00:02:57.978 --> 00:02:59.198]  And that's what's happening right now.
[00:02:59.238 --> 00:03:01.819]  So I salute all the states that have joined Texas.
[00:03:02.338 --> 00:03:06.058]   Abbott's certainly not perfect by a long shot, but he's made the right move here.
[00:03:06.058 --> 00:03:11.459]   And he's forced this crisis out in the open against the globalists.
[00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.318]   So say what you want about Abbott or some of these other Republican governors.
[00:03:14.318 --> 00:03:20.959]   To have 25 of them lined up together repudiating the globalist puppet Joe Biden is beautiful.
[00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:21.959]  It's powerful.
[00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:22.779]  It's very, very strong.
[00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:24.680]  Will this itself defend the border?
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.500]  Will this save the world?
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.760]  No.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:35.984]  But this act of creating a constitutional focal point or a spotlight to point out the constitutional crisis is already happening is nothing but positive.
[00:03:36.245 --> 00:03:37.405]  So a real answer to prayers.
[00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:38.846]  Thank you so much for watching.
[00:03:38.866 --> 00:03:39.726]  Now, please share this link.
[00:03:40.026 --> 00:03:42.329]  And I'll see you tomorrow with a Friday edition at 11 a.m.
[00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:55.445]  Central at Infowars.com, port slash show, stations across the country, and of course at Band.video, as well as Relox Jones on X. While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:03:55.885 --> 00:03:58.048]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:04:02.558 --> 00:04:08.561]  Two years ago we began developing this game that came out so much better than we thought it would and is now a number one hit.
[00:04:09.021 --> 00:04:12.462]  I imagined the control freak left attacking it.
[00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:26.028]  But I didn't know that right when the game came out with perfect timing Elon Musk would release me on X and the whole world will be waking up and the Davos group will be confronted at their own events by world leaders calling out their tyranny.
[00:04:26.448 --> 00:04:27.889]  This is the planets aligning.
[00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:35.074]  And now, MSNBC, the corporate press, Media Matters, George Soros, they're all calling for it to be banned.
[00:04:35.314 --> 00:04:44.360]  Is there a way to counter the types of hate that people like Alex Jones promote and now they do in video games?
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.864]  I mean, this is a party that talks about video games being dangerous for our kids.
[00:04:50.124 --> 00:04:54.367]  And yet here he is with a video game that promotes violence.
[00:04:54.907 --> 00:04:55.828]  You will be silenced.
[00:04:57.294 --> 00:04:59.388]  And celebrates that kind of violence.
[00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:02.871]  You suck, big tech lizard nerd!
[00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:11.258]  Because, let's be honest here, when he is talking about killing globalists, we know what globalists now means for the Republican Party and what that is code for.
[00:05:11.598 --> 00:05:17.123]  Because they understand they're reaching a bunch of young guys who are getting this sort of message beaten into them right now.
[00:05:17.403 --> 00:05:20.146]  Today, I'm playing the Unhinged Alex Jones video game.
[00:05:20.446 --> 00:05:24.329]  I saw it was released on Steam, so I'm like, well, that kind of opens the floodgates.
[00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:25.991]  This game is actually really good fun.
[00:05:26.511 --> 00:05:27.793]  This is insane!
[00:05:28.514 --> 00:05:29.716]  Look at all the blood!
[00:05:29.816 --> 00:05:31.398]  Look at all these zombies!
[00:05:36.246 --> 00:05:36.686]  Okay.
[00:05:36.766 --> 00:05:37.628]  I'll eat your ass!
[00:05:38.128 --> 00:05:39.290]  Okay, so that is what he said.
[00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.634]  I'll eat your ass!
[00:05:42.114 --> 00:05:48.059]  I don't know what the characteristics of the game are beyond that he's involved and that it's killing globalists.
[00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:57.746]  This is the kind of thing that will become a normalization lever in teaching people, oh yeah, it's okay to kill, it's okay to kill the globalists.
[00:05:57.946 --> 00:05:58.826]  This is pretty amazing.
[00:06:00.788 --> 00:06:02.789]  Jump around, jump around.
[00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.511]  Alex Jones, you are a hero!
[00:06:08.353 --> 00:06:09.955]  This is supposed to be Justin Trudeau, I think.
[00:06:11.463 --> 00:06:12.264]  Come on, Mark!
[00:06:13.745 --> 00:06:14.486]  Oh, shit!
[00:06:14.906 --> 00:06:16.468]  Mark Zuckerberg, kill me!
[00:06:16.628 --> 00:06:17.569]  Forget him crawling away.
[00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.410]  Wait!
[00:06:19.631 --> 00:06:20.431]  What them dogs gonna do?
[00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:23.474]  They gonna... Oh, they ate his ass!
[00:06:23.755 --> 00:06:26.677]  Find out what they're scared of at alexjonesgame.com.
[00:06:26.897 --> 00:06:30.040]  Follow the link from there to Steam and download it and share it.
[00:06:30.361 --> 00:06:30.961]  It's 1776.
[00:06:31.462 --> 00:06:33.263]  It funds the info war.
[00:06:33.604 --> 00:06:35.005]  It is key in the culture war.
[00:06:35.025 --> 00:06:36.186]  We need to be engaged
