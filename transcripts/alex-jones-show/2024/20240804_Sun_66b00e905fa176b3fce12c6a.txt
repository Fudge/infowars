[00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.059]  InfoWars.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:44.504]  Well, it's my mother's birthday today, and I was supposed to go to her house and have dinner with her, but I told him to wait a few hours because I had to come in.
[00:00:45.084 --> 00:00:46.185]  Chase Geiser does a great job.
[00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:53.788]  He was going to be hosting, but he can't not be here during something this important.
[00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:58.118]  Chase is coming up later, but for now you got me.
[00:00:58.718 --> 00:01:00.520]  It is Sunday, August 4th, 2024.
[00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:03.202]  We are live.
[00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:04.564]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:13.231]  Tommy Robinson being blamed by the UK Prime Minister for riots all over the UK after Islamists and others murder, rape, and kill and pillage with total abandon.
[00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:17.535]  He's joining us live exclusively.
[00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:18.556]  The British
[00:01:20.518 --> 00:01:24.181]  Second Civil War, it appears, in the last 200 and something years.
[00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:29.644]  This Lord Cromwell, Lord High Commander, it appears has begun.
[00:01:29.764 --> 00:01:31.486]  Tommy's tried to stop it, so have we.
[00:01:33.447 --> 00:01:37.850]  Islamists are just running around attacking any white people they can find, and the media is covering it up.
[00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.771]  Because of Elon Musk, you're able to see it.
[00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:41.853]  Google, Facebook, all of them will let you see it.
[00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:49.817]  BBC, CNN, but on X at Real Alex Jones, oh my goodness, I probably posted 50 videos today.
[00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:51.137]  It is crazy.
[00:01:53.018 --> 00:01:55.018]  On top of that, we've got U.S.
[00:01:55.058 --> 00:01:57.879]  and Israel bracing for imminent Iranian attack tomorrow morning.
[00:01:59.339 --> 00:02:03.640]  Multiple aircraft carriers and flotillas of ships are ready to go to war with Iran.
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.280]  Iran has giant sleeper cells inside the United States, the U.N.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.201]  I mean, normally one of these stories would be just a giant.
[00:02:12.677 --> 00:02:13.498]  The U.N.
[00:02:13.698 --> 00:02:23.227]  now, in a video, when they're meeting about their pandemic plans, is openly talking about NATO invading the U.S.
[00:02:23.347 --> 00:02:23.828]  and U.N.
[00:02:23.868 --> 00:02:25.470]  troops force-injecting you.
[00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.591]  It's coming up.
[00:02:27.732 --> 00:02:28.893]  You can't make this up.
[00:02:30.354 --> 00:02:31.756]  It's just all out in the open now.
[00:02:33.404 --> 00:02:44.652]  Then we've got the Feds saying Friday they believe a cyber attack's gonna happen that won't shut down voting but will shut down the 32 states that have voter ID where they check that you're in the voter roll when you vote.
[00:02:44.712 --> 00:02:45.313]  Like Texas.
[00:02:46.213 --> 00:02:46.814]  Or Oklahoma.
[00:02:46.854 --> 00:02:47.314]  Or Florida.
[00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:49.316]  Or Idaho.
[00:02:50.476 --> 00:02:50.997]  Or Utah.
[00:02:52.383 --> 00:02:58.968]  And they're saying the hackers are going to attack the voter database computers, so they'll be able to verify who's a citizen and who's not.
[00:02:59.488 --> 00:03:02.130]  I mean, only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
[00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.031]  We've got that, and then stuff like this.
[00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:06.513]  It happened Friday.
[00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:08.214]  It's gotten almost zero coverage.
[00:03:08.995 --> 00:03:16.961]  Berkshire Hathaway, that is the largest owner of BlackRock and Bank of America, so that's the tip of the pyramid.
[00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:22.565]  Dumped 55.8% of its Apple stock Friday.
[00:03:22.925 --> 00:03:25.267]  The number one chip in the world.
[00:03:25.627 --> 00:03:27.168]  The number one blue chip stock.
[00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.272]  Leading the Dow Jones and leading the Nasdaq.
[00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:35.535]  Dumped over half his stock in one day.
[00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:38.017]  Baby, you know what that means.
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.861]  Lordy, lordy.
[00:03:44.383 --> 00:03:48.606]  Buckle up, buckaroo, because it's on like Donkey Kong.
[00:03:48.906 --> 00:03:49.366]  Look at this.
[00:03:49.386 --> 00:03:53.029]  It's on Zero Hedge, it's on Infowars.com, the clip's coming up.
[00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:59.353]  Peter Hotez, the mini-me of Fauci, calls for police deployment against anti-vaxxers.
[00:03:59.653 --> 00:04:00.354]  It's worse than that.
[00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:07.859]  UN and NATO troops to take over the media, lockdown, martial law, and force inject you under the UN treaty.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.880]  What?
[00:04:09.935 --> 00:04:20.579]  I came in yesterday and shot a report on the fact that their global pandemic treaty failed, but having countries implement it regardless, and it talks about lockdowns, forced injections, arresting people to speak out against it.
[00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:21.959]  You're like, well that's New Zealand.
[00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:22.819]  No, it's a beta test.
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.540]  It's in the official UN meeting.
[00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:27.461]  We have the video.
[00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:29.422]  It's coming up.
[00:04:31.082 --> 00:04:33.383]  That alone would just be bombshell.
[00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:39.191]  Bombshell upon bombshell upon bombshell.
[00:04:39.331 --> 00:04:43.453]  I mean, this is crazy town.
[00:04:43.993 --> 00:04:50.657]  Then you've got Kamala refusing to debate Trump, and you tune into mainstream media, the corporate media, the enemy of the people, and they say Trump's refusing to debate.
[00:04:53.398 --> 00:04:56.420]  You'll want to tune into Tommy Robinson coming up in about 27 minutes.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.381]  It's actually 27 minutes, 33 after.
[00:05:02.003 --> 00:05:02.783]  And so much more.
[00:05:03.184 --> 00:05:05.685]  This is tomorrow's news today, and you've got the real power.
[00:05:06.445 --> 00:05:08.866]  Take the links from Real Alex Jones on X, share them now.
[00:05:08.886 --> 00:05:09.406]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:25.492]  Riders on the storm.
[00:05:25.712 --> 00:05:27.213]  Riders on the storm.
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.723]  So the UK is in a anti-UK, anti-Christian civil war.
[00:05:50.928 --> 00:05:56.889]  Everywhere the Muslims move, in every case, they act real friendly, until their numbers get to 10-20%, then they attack.
[00:05:57.489 --> 00:06:12.672]  Then they drive you out of the towns and cities, they take full control of them, then they keep expanding until your country falls to them, whether you're Constantinople 600 years ago, or whether you are, you know, Spain 1,000 years ago, and it took the Spanish 500-600 years to kick the Muslims out.
[00:06:16.607 --> 00:06:24.376]  And so, if you look at a map of the world where Islam's in control, they don't let you have your own religion, they don't let you have any freedom, they totally control you in a few little pockets.
[00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:33.762]  So, that's where the UK is right now, and Tommy Robinson is coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:34.163 --> 00:06:43.707]  Then we've got Iran, after the leader of Hamas was killed, saying they're getting ready to attack Israel imminently, and all these aircraft carriers and U.S.
[00:06:43.747 --> 00:06:44.348]  ships over there.
[00:06:45.048 --> 00:06:54.473]  Well, if you're gonna go blow the Muslims up, which I don't think they should do, let them live in their own countries in peace, just don't let them come here and take everything over, you might not want to bring millions of them into your country.
[00:06:56.485 --> 00:06:57.225]  At the same time.
[00:06:57.245 --> 00:06:58.025]  So we've got all that.
[00:06:58.806 --> 00:06:59.086]  U.S.
[00:06:59.146 --> 00:07:01.907]  and Israel bracing for imminent Iran attack.
[00:07:02.087 --> 00:07:02.547]  Report.
[00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:05.007]  U.K.
[00:07:05.027 --> 00:07:05.668]  joins U.S.
[00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:10.609]  in deploying military forces to Middle East after Israeli escalation.
[00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:16.090]  Elon Musk speculates civil war inevitable as violence sweeps U.K.
[00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:24.893]  Israel assassination spree has United Hezbollah's hands for broader and deeper strikes on Iran.
[00:07:26.667 --> 00:07:32.370]  That's just some of the news that we've got on those fronts.
[00:07:34.391 --> 00:07:39.293]  Then we've got our wide open borders and Kamala Harris refusing to debate.
[00:07:40.353 --> 00:07:43.415]  And the media is spinning it that Trump's scared because he wants her on Fox.
[00:07:43.955 --> 00:07:45.696]  It goes on and on.
[00:07:45.736 --> 00:07:47.157]  But then we've got this clip.
[00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:48.877]  We're going to play it.
[00:07:50.898 --> 00:07:55.981]  And that's Peter Hotez, the official globalist spokesperson with Fauci.
[00:07:57.071 --> 00:08:05.877]  In a UN online meeting, saying we want to use UN troops and NATO to make people take the shots and have lockdowns.
[00:08:07.758 --> 00:08:10.980]  And the same thing is being said in the UK.
[00:08:12.281 --> 00:08:13.362]  I have the articles right here.
[00:08:15.843 --> 00:08:23.909]  They are saying, we are going to lock everything down like we did in COVID,
[00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:39.031]  To stop the violence when they brought in a totally incompatible group of people with 80% of these Muslim invaders on welfare and not even having jobs and running around in their nightgowns all day, pissed off saying we want Sharia law.
[00:08:39.251 --> 00:08:43.534]  Well then why the hell did you come to a Western country?
[00:08:46.335 --> 00:08:47.716]  And Elon Musk is dead on.
[00:08:48.436 --> 00:08:51.078]  This will create inevitable civil war.
[00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:54.760]  The only question is, has it
[00:08:56.463 --> 00:08:57.484]  Officially started.
[00:08:57.544 --> 00:09:01.266]  So there's a lot of things the globalists are going to use for full control.
[00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:12.394]  But coming up, Homeland Security says, oh, people are going to hit the elections.
[00:09:12.754 --> 00:09:14.095]  But don't worry, the elections will work.
[00:09:14.735 --> 00:09:18.418]  But it's going to shut down the voter ID systems that 32 states have.
[00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:21.099]  And so you won't be able to prove somebody's a citizen or not when they vote.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.922]  That's the perfect thing you do since these states have put in these controls.
[00:09:30.083 --> 00:09:43.608]  And then we've got the UN World Treaty on the environment and on the response to COVID, the pandemic treaty.
[00:09:44.853 --> 00:09:47.916]  And they're unable to ram it through, so instead they just have countries implement it.
[00:09:48.476 --> 00:09:50.558]  And I read what New Zealand is putting in.
[00:09:50.578 --> 00:09:51.859]  You say, well that's New Zealand.
[00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:52.740]  No, this affects us all.
[00:09:53.061 --> 00:10:02.389]  And it's literally arresting anybody that criticizes lockdowns, forced injections, quarantine centers that are the smokescreen for locking people up and re-education.
[00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:10.957]  And Maduro in Venezuela is saying he's gonna lock up all of his opposition in the prisons and quote, re-educate them.
[00:10:13.055 --> 00:10:16.097]  So we're at the end of a giant global financial bubble.
[00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:21.181]  50 plus percent of Apple stock just got dumped Friday, almost no news coverage.
[00:10:22.882 --> 00:10:25.684]  The top stock in the world, half of it just got dumped by the main owner.
[00:10:27.105 --> 00:10:28.266]  Half of Warren Buffett's stock.
[00:10:29.727 --> 00:10:30.687]  Hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:10:31.688 --> 00:10:35.071]  And it's just a tiny little blip on the radar screen.
[00:10:36.311 --> 00:10:38.053]  We are in the time of incredible change.
[00:10:38.093 --> 00:10:39.674]  Lennon was an evil person, but he was smart.
[00:10:41.271 --> 00:10:45.436]  And he famously said, there are decades when nothing happens, and weeks where decades happen.
[00:10:47.558 --> 00:10:49.240]  And that's where we are right now, that's what I'm telling you.
[00:10:49.541 --> 00:10:54.547]  With 92 days left of the election, and then the 79 days after that until Trump's inaugurated.
[00:10:55.674 --> 00:10:56.555]  What's that, 180 days?
[00:10:56.575 --> 00:10:57.295]  We'll put it on screen.
[00:10:57.776 --> 00:11:00.919]  We have countdowns for how long to the election and how long to the inauguration.
[00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:07.705]  I keep telling everybody, my spider sense is it's 92 days to the election, 7 hours, 47 minutes, 54 seconds.
[00:11:07.985 --> 00:11:09.166]  And how many days to the inauguration?
[00:11:09.186 --> 00:11:09.166]  168!
[00:11:09.206 --> 00:11:10.167]  Wow, time's flying.
[00:11:14.082 --> 00:11:21.628]  So what I'm telling you is we're in the most important point of change in modern history, probably in human history on this planet, we don't know.
[00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:24.610]  But definitely in the last few hundred years.
[00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:25.831]  It's so dangerous.
[00:11:26.271 --> 00:11:27.312]  It's so insane.
[00:11:28.753 --> 00:11:33.737]  And I see people going about their business, going to play tennis and golf and going to the movies and going to dinner.
[00:11:33.797 --> 00:11:34.277]  Hey, great.
[00:11:34.657 --> 00:11:35.398]  Enjoy yourselves.
[00:11:35.718 --> 00:11:39.521]  But the Titanic is about to tump over and break in two and sink.
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:54.106]  And by the time the public figures out how much trouble they're in with the jobless numbers pouring out and the inflation spiraling out of control, what is the public going to do when they finally figure all this out?
[00:11:54.586 --> 00:11:57.708]  Well, England's a few years ahead of us, so's Scotland, so's Ireland.
[00:11:58.428 --> 00:11:58.969]  They're rioting.
[00:11:59.129 --> 00:12:02.030]  They're tired of being raped and murdered and killed.
[00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.132]  10, 20 to 1 Islamic crime compared to anybody.
[00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:17.369]  Because the Muslims know, and then all the, you know, the average woman has like eight kids, their sons all get on welfare, and they just walk around all arrogant with a bunch of subservient Brits, not knowing that the British have a long fuse.
[00:12:18.729 --> 00:12:21.151]  But once you burn it down, it's a big explosion.
[00:12:22.192 --> 00:12:32.859]  And the globalists think they're gonna get all this power and control out of stirring this up, and people that are out there rioting are walking into a trap, and, you know, I don't agree what they're doing, but the point is, this is where we are.
[00:12:32.899 --> 00:12:34.140]  This is the angrier world.
[00:12:36.175 --> 00:12:40.598]  The Klaus Schwab has set up for everybody.
[00:12:42.039 --> 00:12:44.621]  So, here is a U.N.
[00:12:44.661 --> 00:12:58.891]  meeting with the discredited joke Peter Hotez, basically the Robin to Batman, you know, Fauci's Batman, he's Robin, that runs around and says, all the shots work, 100% they're so good for you, we should make everybody take them.
[00:13:00.493 --> 00:13:04.996]  Well now because people aren't taking them, he's upset.
[00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:14.682]  And here's the New Zealand pandemic plan that openly says forced injections, lock everybody up.
[00:13:15.382 --> 00:13:17.623]  I did a report on it yesterday on X. It's on Infowars.com.
[00:13:17.643 --> 00:13:19.963]  You can read the subsections of it.
[00:13:20.503 --> 00:13:21.904]  This is what they want for the whole world.
[00:13:21.924 --> 00:13:22.664]  This is what they're planning.
[00:13:22.684 --> 00:13:23.084]  This is what the U.S.
[00:13:23.104 --> 00:13:23.644]  government's planning.
[00:13:23.884 --> 00:13:25.064]  Hell, the White House helped write this.
[00:13:27.685 --> 00:13:29.685]  And so that's where we are right now, breaking.
[00:13:29.765 --> 00:13:33.326]  WEF openly announced its plan for quarantines and forced injections, and then
[00:13:35.128 --> 00:13:46.397]  This video that Hotez removed off his YouTube channel two days ago has been reposted to X because, oh, we weren't supposed to be watching him when he's in a UN meeting.
[00:13:47.959 --> 00:13:52.442]  And he's saying, I told Biden we need to use NATO and the UN and the military.
[00:13:52.663 --> 00:13:53.884]  And you say, well, that's just Hotez.
[00:13:54.224 --> 00:14:01.450]  I have Dr. Ryan in my report I filed yesterday, the head of the UN Global Crisis Response, saying
[00:14:03.854 --> 00:14:06.796]  We need totalitarian powers to lock people up and do whatever we want.
[00:14:07.876 --> 00:14:11.038]  And they're gearing up the bird flu and they've got their new mRNA shot ready.
[00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:14.440]  It's all happening right now.
[00:14:18.323 --> 00:14:26.808]  So they're gonna try to use financial collapse, cyber attacks, terror attacks, wars, economic crises,
[00:14:29.588 --> 00:14:31.369]  Assassination of Trump 2.0.
[00:14:31.489 --> 00:14:32.329]  It's all on the table.
[00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.851]  The global bubble is coming to an end.
[00:14:34.891 --> 00:14:36.351]  Their system's coming to an end.
[00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:39.273]  They need to get their world government, cashless society in place.
[00:14:39.533 --> 00:14:44.856]  They want to use orthodox Islam that they brought in as the pretext to create civil war and lock us all down.
[00:14:45.196 --> 00:14:47.477]  They tried Black Lives Matter, but black folks aren't buying it.
[00:14:49.458 --> 00:14:51.379]  So they're going with the four horsemen of the Islamicists.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.521]  Now the full video, I think we didn't post it.
[00:14:55.541 --> 00:14:56.802]  We're going to post it to X right now.
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.262]  Because this is now first and foremost a political problem.
[00:15:01.282 --> 00:15:06.706]  And what I've said to the Biden administration is the health sector can't solve this on its own.
[00:15:06.726 --> 00:15:07.747]  We're going to have to bring in
[00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:28.895]  Homeland Security, Commerce Department, Justice Department to help us understand how to do this.
[00:15:29.035 --> 00:15:41.505]  And I've said the same with, I met with Dr. Tedros last month in Geneva, WHO, the Director General, to say I don't know that the World Health Organization can solve this on our own.
[00:15:41.545 --> 00:15:44.087]  We need the other United Nations agencies.
[00:15:44.827 --> 00:15:53.023]  NATO, this is a security problem because it's no longer a theoretical construct or some arcane academic exercise.
[00:15:53.043 --> 00:15:54.065]  200,000 Americans died.
[00:15:56.345 --> 00:15:59.767]  Because of anti-vaccine aggression, anti-science aggression.
[00:16:00.287 --> 00:16:02.188]  And so this is now a lethal force.
[00:16:03.068 --> 00:16:18.756]  And now I feel as a pediatric vaccine scientist, just as it's important for me to make new vaccines to save lives, the other side of saving lives is countering this anti-vaccine aggression.
[00:16:20.933 --> 00:16:28.516]  Counter the anti-vaccine aggression saying we own our bodies and your shots don't work and kill people with NATO and the UN.
[00:16:32.957 --> 00:16:35.978]  I mean, can this get any more naked?
[00:16:38.199 --> 00:16:41.880]  Can this get any more out in the open?
[00:16:46.182 --> 00:16:46.842]  Look at this headline.
[00:16:48.473 --> 00:17:08.766]  And when you read the cybersecurity document that's right here, press release, by the federal agency that does all of this, the nation's cyber defense agency and national coordinator for the infrastructure security, the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce the risk of digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every day.
[00:17:09.707 --> 00:17:10.408]  And what do they say?
[00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:14.971]  There's going to be giant attacks, but they won't
[00:17:15.936 --> 00:17:18.178]  Denial of service attacks, but they won't take down the voting.
[00:17:18.979 --> 00:17:22.282]  They're going to take down the databases and the voter lookup tools.
[00:17:23.162 --> 00:17:25.605]  So we can see if somebody is a citizen and can vote legally.
[00:17:26.065 --> 00:17:30.189]  So they're telling you what they're going to do.
[00:17:34.187 --> 00:17:35.268]  Starting to figure this out?
[00:17:35.908 --> 00:17:37.369]  Here's the report on Infowars.com.
[00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.693]  Jamie White wrote with the video report I did yesterday on this.
[00:17:41.713 --> 00:17:43.594]  You should go watch if you want to stop this.
[00:17:44.155 --> 00:17:45.335]  Just send it to every member of Congress.
[00:17:45.996 --> 00:17:51.440]  Deep state planning to undermine 2024 election integrity under cover of pre-planned cyber attack.
[00:17:53.982 --> 00:18:01.608]  And it turns out the CrowdStrike thing was all just a big beta test for this as I said it was coming and then when it happened I said look like it was.
[00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:04.271]  So all I can say is, wow.
[00:18:06.772 --> 00:18:10.654]  What a time to be alive.
[00:18:14.415 --> 00:18:15.616]  And we've got other insanity.
[00:18:16.056 --> 00:18:19.518]  Pelosi says Joe Biden should be added to Mount Rushmore.
[00:18:21.799 --> 00:18:26.861]  We've got Kamala Harris refusing to debate Trump, and then they run headlines, he's refusing to debate.
[00:18:27.101 --> 00:18:28.202]  He's publicly said, I'll debate you.
[00:18:29.945 --> 00:18:33.227]  It's just next level insanity by these people.
[00:18:33.868 --> 00:18:39.891]  You've got the Olympics with all the pedophilia and Satanism and people swimming in the river that's full of feces.
[00:18:42.232 --> 00:18:49.717]  And it just gets more and more insane of the rotten brains of the globalists and the people running things.
[00:18:55.199 --> 00:18:58.562]  Meanwhile, Maduro's announced re-education camps for his political opposition.
[00:18:59.302 --> 00:19:02.765]  The exit polls show between 60 and 65 percent voted for Gonzalez.
[00:19:04.466 --> 00:19:12.052]  He now says Elon Musk, with no proof, is leading a coup against Maduro because he doesn't like communist dictators.
[00:19:14.534 --> 00:19:17.936]  And it just gets crazier and crazier from then.
[00:19:18.977 --> 00:19:20.178]  I was talking to Chase
[00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:22.591]  Right before we went live.
[00:19:23.312 --> 00:19:24.153]  I know I give a lot of orders.
[00:19:24.193 --> 00:19:25.033]  I don't say a lot of stuff.
[00:19:25.494 --> 00:19:27.436]  He was going through Joe Rogan's new special.
[00:19:28.837 --> 00:19:33.041]  And Joe Rogan came out and said he doesn't believe anything the new order says anymore.
[00:19:34.002 --> 00:19:35.604]  He basically believes what Alex Jones says.
[00:19:36.305 --> 00:19:39.288]  Made a joke about Michelle Obama's pee-pee.
[00:19:40.694 --> 00:19:45.076]  But then he found a clip where Joe was talking about me last night in the Big Live special.
[00:19:45.476 --> 00:19:46.576]  Because I didn't have time to watch it.
[00:19:46.616 --> 00:19:47.477]  I didn't watch it when it came out.
[00:19:47.497 --> 00:19:48.357]  I guess it came out Friday.
[00:19:49.117 --> 00:19:50.158]  I told him to give that to you.
[00:19:50.178 --> 00:19:54.780]  I don't know if people remembered that or if that happened, but let's... By the time we have left this segment, I did want that clip.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.700]  So, if we could have that, that'd be great.
[00:19:57.641 --> 00:19:59.682]  But regardless, if we don't, I'll cover it later in the broadcast.
[00:19:59.702 --> 00:20:00.582]  We have Tommy Robinson.
[00:20:02.103 --> 00:20:04.404]  We have Tommy Robinson coming up.
[00:20:04.424 --> 00:20:09.646]  But more important than Joe's clip about me is the short clip I posted on X, where he says,
[00:20:10.788 --> 00:20:12.789]  Since they lied about COVID, I don't believe anything they say.
[00:20:13.069 --> 00:20:15.590]  And that's what Joe told me a year ago and six months ago at dinner.
[00:20:16.911 --> 00:20:19.672]  He was just like, no, you're right about all this stuff and I'm done and I'm gonna go after him.
[00:20:19.992 --> 00:20:20.752]  And I told people that.
[00:20:21.873 --> 00:20:23.393]  And now you're seeing Joe at that point.
[00:20:23.413 --> 00:20:28.875]  And the reason that's important is, he's a bellwether for the general public.
[00:20:30.176 --> 00:20:37.339]  And if we keep believing a system that he knows how to get us, we basically deserve what we get.
[00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.171]  Now before I play this clip of Joe, we'll try to grab the other one too.
[00:20:42.671 --> 00:20:44.151]  It's viral everywhere.
[00:20:45.092 --> 00:20:46.972]  Liz Churchill put it out first, so I retweeted.
[00:20:47.512 --> 00:20:48.493]  It's only like a minute long.
[00:20:48.553 --> 00:20:50.353]  It's him talking about, I don't believe anything anymore.
[00:20:50.373 --> 00:20:52.374]  I meant to give it to the crew.
[00:20:52.394 --> 00:20:54.514]  Maybe I did, but I didn't see it on my list.
[00:20:54.535 --> 00:20:57.535]  But the point is, is that I can't do this without you.
[00:20:58.696 --> 00:21:04.297]  And we really are the influential tip of the spear, other than Trump and Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan.
[00:21:04.518 --> 00:21:05.658]  I mean, it's literally Trump.
[00:21:06.897 --> 00:21:08.999]  Elon Musk, Alex Jones, Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson.
[00:21:09.239 --> 00:21:10.099]  That's the big five.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.382]  And they know nine times out of ten, I'm the one on the phone.
[00:21:14.462 --> 00:21:15.343]  Not bragging, this is true.
[00:21:15.503 --> 00:21:16.043]  Joe said this.
[00:21:16.063 --> 00:21:16.904]  I talk every day.
[00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:19.206]  Sending stuff to Carlson.
[00:21:19.246 --> 00:21:19.986]  He gets his own stuff.
[00:21:20.006 --> 00:21:20.707]  You know what I mean?
[00:21:20.727 --> 00:21:22.048]  Joe sends me a lot of stuff too.
[00:21:22.728 --> 00:21:23.929]  Sending stuff to Trump.
[00:21:23.969 --> 00:21:24.849]  Sending stuff to everybody.
[00:21:24.869 --> 00:21:27.191]  That's what I... Half of my work is not even on air.
[00:21:27.231 --> 00:21:28.272]  It's behind the scenes.
[00:21:29.192 --> 00:21:29.993]  Telling people what's coming next.
[00:21:30.013 --> 00:21:30.674]  And they listen now.
[00:21:31.724 --> 00:21:32.884]  That's an important broadcast.
[00:21:33.805 --> 00:21:36.485]  So the enemy seven weeks ago tried to shut us down outside of court order.
[00:21:36.505 --> 00:21:37.705]  We went through hell to stay on air.
[00:21:37.745 --> 00:21:38.626]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:21:39.706 --> 00:21:41.226]  Don't take any broadcast for granted.
[00:21:41.546 --> 00:21:42.247]  Share the articles.
[00:21:42.287 --> 00:21:42.927]  Share the videos.
[00:21:42.987 --> 00:21:44.447]  Share the live feeds of Alex Jones.
[00:21:44.747 --> 00:21:46.307]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:21:46.568 --> 00:21:47.208]  Bandop video.

[00:22:03.926 --> 00:22:06.767]  We go to the manufacturer, say, you're already top-rated, can you make it better?
[00:22:07.527 --> 00:22:09.828]  They go, yeah, our turmeric's 75%, nobody does that.
[00:22:10.129 --> 00:22:10.789]  How high could you go?
[00:22:10.989 --> 00:22:12.610]  We'll go back with you two weeks later.
[00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.610]  95?
[00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:14.311]  Make it 95%.
[00:22:16.612 --> 00:22:19.073]  So, colloidal silver, all of it, the very best.
[00:22:20.053 --> 00:22:23.875]  Drjonesnaturals.com, I can't fight this war without you.

[00:23:34.781 --> 00:23:35.482]  It's symbiotic.
[00:23:35.842 --> 00:23:36.843]  We want a relationship with you.
[00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:39.225]  But I cannot take on the New World Order without you.
[00:23:40.506 --> 00:23:45.230]  So make the decision, and I want to thank those that have and ask those that haven't, hey, okay, it's your choice, I'll manage it.
[00:23:45.511 --> 00:23:47.452]  Why have you not gone to drjonesnaturals.com?
[00:23:48.033 --> 00:23:49.694]  Why have you not gone to mfulworthstore.com?
[00:23:49.975 --> 00:23:50.195]  Why?
[00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:53.336]  Do you have any idea what Nitric Boost will do in your life?
[00:23:53.356 --> 00:23:54.837]  Especially if you're a man, you'll notice right away.
[00:23:55.037 --> 00:23:57.738]  We don't sell it as that, but it has that effect.
[00:23:58.938 --> 00:23:59.358]  Let me tell you.
[00:24:01.138 --> 00:24:02.259]  My wife can tell when I don't take it.
[00:24:02.299 --> 00:24:05.540]  She's already satisfied, but she's like, we're adults here.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.761]  She's like, oh, I haven't taken your Nitric Boost this week, have you?
[00:24:12.141 --> 00:24:14.342]  I mean, heart is a rock when I take it, folks.
[00:24:16.735 --> 00:24:18.737]  You know, I'm 50, not as... I'm not.
[00:24:19.117 --> 00:24:20.058]  That's how good it works.
[00:24:20.138 --> 00:24:23.700]  And imagine what it does to your cardiovascular system if it's doing that for your Johnson.
[00:24:24.001 --> 00:24:25.021]  I'm just... I'm an adult here.
[00:24:25.041 --> 00:24:25.782]  I'm telling you the truth.
[00:24:26.142 --> 00:24:26.703]  It works.
[00:24:26.823 --> 00:24:27.383]  It's real.
[00:24:27.944 --> 00:24:28.404]  Go get it.
[00:24:28.804 --> 00:24:29.985]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:24:30.846 --> 00:24:31.747]  It's not sold for that.
[00:24:31.787 --> 00:24:32.827]  That's just the side effect.
[00:24:34.108 --> 00:24:36.590]  But it does what Viagra does in an unhealthy way, healthily.
[00:24:36.931 --> 00:24:38.912]  That's the same mechanisms, but healthily.
[00:24:39.453 --> 00:24:39.673]  All right.
[00:24:40.574 --> 00:24:41.754]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:24:42.135 --> 00:24:43.636]  Drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:24:44.076 --> 00:24:44.737]  Get it now.
[00:24:46.793 --> 00:24:47.854]  Here's the Joe Rogan Club.
[00:24:49.054 --> 00:24:55.458]  Probably an agent provocateur sent in to discredit your organization with ridiculous behavior.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.641]  Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago.
[00:25:02.021 --> 00:25:05.763]  Listen, listen, he's right about a lot of things.
[00:25:05.783 --> 00:25:06.764]  He was wrong about that one thing, though.
[00:25:07.084 --> 00:25:07.784]  But he's right.
[00:25:08.745 --> 00:25:09.165]  He's right.
[00:25:09.205 --> 00:25:10.326]  That one thing was a big one.
[00:25:10.606 --> 00:25:11.266]  But he's right.
[00:25:11.706 --> 00:25:12.547]  That one thing was huge.
[00:25:12.607 --> 00:25:13.968]  But he's often correct.
[00:25:16.141 --> 00:25:17.341]  Yeah, there's a longer clip.
[00:25:17.381 --> 00:25:18.442]  We'll play later on the show.
[00:25:18.462 --> 00:25:19.102]  We'll play tomorrow.
[00:25:19.522 --> 00:25:21.042]  But that's not the one I even wanted.
[00:25:21.062 --> 00:25:22.023]  I thought I sent this.
[00:25:22.063 --> 00:25:23.663]  It's the clip where he talks about Michelle Obama.
[00:25:24.323 --> 00:25:24.883]  Do we have that?
[00:25:27.144 --> 00:25:27.624]  It's everywhere.
[00:25:27.644 --> 00:25:29.064]  You just, you go to X, type in.
[00:25:30.305 --> 00:25:30.765]  You have it.
[00:25:31.365 --> 00:25:31.765]  We have it.
[00:25:31.845 --> 00:25:32.165]  Roll it.
[00:25:32.205 --> 00:25:32.625]  Here it is.
[00:25:35.426 --> 00:25:37.807]  Time, the country's almost back to normal before World War III.
[00:25:41.107 --> 00:25:42.228]  COVID was just so strange.
[00:25:42.908 --> 00:25:46.650]  We lost a lot of people during COVID, and most of them are still alive.
[00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.872]  Yeah, right?
[00:25:49.892 --> 00:25:49.992]  Right?
[00:25:50.012 --> 00:25:56.876]  Yeah, there's a lot of people that I don't fuck with anymore.
[00:25:57.577 --> 00:26:02.700]  Before COVID, I would have told you that vaccines are the most important invention in human history.
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.082]  After COVID, I'm like, I don't think we went to the moon.
[00:26:07.807 --> 00:26:18.936]  I think Michelle Obama's got a dick, I think Pizzagate is real, I think there's direct energy weapons in Antarctica!
[00:26:19.016 --> 00:26:22.639]  I'm just kidding, I don't think Michelle Obama's got a dick, but I believe all that other shit.
[00:26:28.846 --> 00:26:32.790]  Delay that on air just butchers the living hell out of it, but in post we'll put that out.
[00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:34.692]  Notice Democrats can cuss all over TV.
[00:26:34.712 --> 00:26:35.853]  They don't get fines or in trouble.
[00:26:35.953 --> 00:26:37.514]  We are conservatives or populists.
[00:26:38.095 --> 00:26:42.139]  We still follow all the FCC rules because I'm on over 300 radio stations.
[00:26:42.938 --> 00:26:43.939]  All right, so we're going to go to break.
[00:26:44.519 --> 00:26:46.280]  Tommy Robinson is connected.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.701]  He's going to be on with us from Cyprus.
[00:26:49.101 --> 00:26:49.741]  They've doxed him.
[00:26:49.761 --> 00:26:50.522]  They're coming after him.
[00:26:50.562 --> 00:26:52.523]  The Prime Minister says they're going to arrest him.
[00:26:53.343 --> 00:26:58.506]  All for calling for peace and all for exposing the globalist Islamic invasion of Europe.
[00:26:58.526 --> 00:27:01.828]  Tommy Robinson is coming up right now.
[00:27:01.868 --> 00:27:10.952]  And then in the second, third, and fourth hour, all the other news, all the other clips, all the other details, your calls, so much more tonight.
[00:27:11.012 --> 00:27:12.133]  Chase Geyser's coming in.
[00:27:12.873 --> 00:27:13.854]  And then at 8 a.m.
[00:27:13.894 --> 00:27:15.516]  tomorrow, Harrison Smith's been on fire.
[00:27:15.536 --> 00:27:18.640]  We'll play some clips of him coming up, explaining what's happening in the UK.
[00:27:20.162 --> 00:27:21.083]  We're gonna wake up in the morning.
[00:27:21.103 --> 00:27:23.944]  Hell, it's ten hours ahead anyways, nine hours ahead.
[00:27:24.785 --> 00:27:28.107]  Looks like we'll probably, you know, have an expanded war with Israel and Iran by the morning.
[00:27:28.327 --> 00:27:29.148]  Hope that's not the case.
[00:27:29.588 --> 00:27:30.348]  We've got all that.
[00:27:31.009 --> 00:27:32.229]  And then I come on at 11 a.m.
[00:27:32.309 --> 00:27:36.712]  Central, and then Owen Troyer does a superlative job, 3 p.m.
[00:27:36.792 --> 00:27:39.774]  Central, with The War Room, at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:27:40.054 --> 00:27:41.235]  But the globalists are in trouble.
[00:27:41.255 --> 00:27:42.576]  They're planning major crises.
[00:27:42.876 --> 00:27:44.977]  We're gonna be here chronicling it, trying to stop it together.
[00:27:45.378 --> 00:27:49.140]  Follow me on all the shows, and thanks for supporting our sponsors, at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:28:04.324 --> 00:28:09.387]  Well, we could not have a more important guest to set the record straight than Tommy Robinson.
[00:28:09.407 --> 00:28:19.392]  I've known him for more than 15 years, or right around 15, since he began to expose Muslim-Islamic grooming gangs in the UK that he saw in a little town he lived in in England.
[00:28:20.573 --> 00:28:22.373]  The man's been put in solitary confinement for years.
[00:28:22.393 --> 00:28:23.134]  He's been tortured.
[00:28:23.694 --> 00:28:25.635]  He's an incredible patriot.
[00:28:25.695 --> 00:28:26.976]  He has amazing courage.
[00:28:27.893 --> 00:28:31.314]  Now, he's been having big rallies for years in the UK, all peaceful.
[00:28:31.514 --> 00:28:32.434]  He always calls for peace.
[00:28:33.094 --> 00:28:38.176]  And for seven weeks, he planned Unite the Kingdom rally that happened on July 27th.
[00:28:38.296 --> 00:28:49.618]  It was peaceful, except the police came and arrested him for terrorism, for having the people simply stand and promote liberty and say that they don't want wide-open borders.
[00:28:49.638 --> 00:28:51.559]  Now, remember, Constantinople fell 600 years ago.
[00:28:53.149 --> 00:29:15.253]  I don't want to be enemies with the Muslims, but if you look at a map of Islam around the world, every country they end up taking over, they end up kicking everybody else out, like Christian Lebanon.
[00:29:15.293 --> 00:29:20.554]  Led them all in the 70s, and now the Christians have been pushed out and get hunted down and killed in the streets.
[00:29:20.674 --> 00:29:22.274]  It's just a fact that
[00:29:23.925 --> 00:29:28.651]  Orthodox Islam, dominant Islam, wants to take over and believes it's its mandate to do so.
[00:29:29.654 --> 00:29:33.155]  Show, the Prime Minister has come out and said he's going to try to arrest Tommy.
[00:29:33.575 --> 00:29:36.356]  Tommy already had a family vacation to Cyprus planned.
[00:29:36.836 --> 00:29:38.796]  They're calling him a coward, saying he ran.
[00:29:39.657 --> 00:29:40.877]  Now they're arresting him for terrorism.
[00:29:40.897 --> 00:29:45.238]  He's already set to go the next day on a well-deserved holiday with his family.
[00:29:45.878 --> 00:29:56.401]  Show, I want to roll a clip from the Prime Minister today directly calling out Tommy, because that's what the newspapers are all saying, as though Tommy ordered thugs to attack and then he left the country.
[00:29:57.234 --> 00:30:02.657]  The Wall Street Journal said, I stood back in the distance on January 6th and commanded people to go in the building until the video came out.
[00:30:02.697 --> 00:30:03.557]  I said, don't go in the building.
[00:30:04.237 --> 00:30:07.359]  So Tommy was on the show Friday saying, it's about to blow up.
[00:30:07.459 --> 00:30:08.199]  Don't be violent.
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.580]  You're walking into a trap.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:16.043]  That interview has got like 5 million views on X. Thank God for X or none of this would even be known because the corporate media can lie.
[00:30:16.063 --> 00:30:17.244]  I'm going to go to Tommy here in a moment.
[00:30:17.264 --> 00:30:18.284]  I want to just set this up.
[00:30:18.584 --> 00:30:20.065]  Here's the prime minister just hours ago.
[00:30:21.084 --> 00:30:28.409]  Individuals will be held on remand, charges will follow and convictions will follow.
[00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:40.857]  I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.
[00:30:42.077 --> 00:30:47.321]  This is not protest, it is organised violent thuggery.
[00:30:48.177 --> 00:30:52.119]  And it has no place on our streets or online.
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.821]  That's why the Islamic crime against the general public in the UK is at least 10 to 1.
[00:30:57.482 --> 00:31:00.663]  They import this, they bring this in, they house them in hotels, all of it.
[00:31:01.064 --> 00:31:11.649]  Just two days ago the Prime Minister enraged everybody on purpose, as Tommy has said, by coming out and not caring about the three little girls that got stabbed to death by another one of these illegal aliens or illegal aliens kid.
[00:31:14.577 --> 00:31:15.538]  And the public's pissed.
[00:31:15.558 --> 00:31:16.538]  They're tired of being attacked.
[00:31:16.558 --> 00:31:17.899]  So, Tommy, you've got the floor here.
[00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:22.102]  We'll be rolling B-roll of what's been happening, you know, here, obviously.
[00:31:22.142 --> 00:31:29.147]  But, wow, you are now the scapegoat, yet again, for simply standing up and saying we need to peacefully take our country back.
[00:31:29.167 --> 00:31:29.667]  Tommy.
[00:31:32.309 --> 00:31:39.734]  Alex, on the 27th of July, we mobilized 100,000 patriots, the largest gathering of patriots Britain has ever seen.
[00:31:40.473 --> 00:31:42.234]  That must have put the fear of God into them.
[00:31:42.274 --> 00:31:43.315]  It must have terrified them.
[00:31:43.895 --> 00:31:52.100]  So then we had the incident where the three young girls were brutally murdered and many others stabbed and are still fighting for their life.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.641]  There was then a demonstration that evening.
[00:31:54.821 --> 00:31:58.323]  Now that evening had nothing to do with me.
[00:31:58.803 --> 00:32:03.906]  It was locals on an estate who come out angry and clashed with the police.
[00:32:04.387 --> 00:32:08.529]  Now that evening, the government and the police put out
[00:32:09.372 --> 00:32:11.156]  Claiming it was the English Defence League.
[00:32:11.717 --> 00:32:13.921]  Now Alex, I led the English Defence League.
[00:32:14.041 --> 00:32:14.722]  I founded it.
[00:32:15.103 --> 00:32:17.508]  It has not existed for a decade.
[00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:21.539]  So very early on, they were building up the Fall Guy.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:31.869]  Then, all over the news, our League politicians are talking about prescribing an organisation that doesn't even exist as a terrorist organisation.
[00:32:32.569 --> 00:32:41.418]  So every single bit of disorder that has gone on in the last three, four, five days, there's another hotel on fire now as we speak in a town called Tamworth.
[00:32:41.858 --> 00:32:46.082]  So these disorders are breaking up in towns and cities across the UK.
[00:32:46.483 --> 00:32:54.331]  They're organised by people in those towns and cities and these people are angry and they're fighting, yeah?
[00:32:54.571 --> 00:32:55.972]  And they're fighting the authorities.
[00:32:56.353 --> 00:32:57.494]  Now, it's not...
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.260]  The English Defence League.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.161]  Why have they blamed the English Defence League?
[00:33:01.501 --> 00:33:07.704]  Because they want to create this bogeyman rather than say, the British public are piss.
[00:33:08.264 --> 00:33:10.685]  They're piss in every town and city.
[00:33:11.045 --> 00:33:15.607]  They're angry up and down this country for failures to listen to them.
[00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:17.508]  And then when they try to have a voice,
[00:33:18.382 --> 00:33:26.126]  When they actually take to the street peacefully as we did on the 27th of July, they still attack you with the media as far-right, as extremist.
[00:33:26.426 --> 00:33:34.150]  But our momentum as a cultural movement that we were building, Alex, we started on the 1st of June with 30,000.
[00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:35.591]  We then went to the 27th of July with 100,000.
[00:33:35.651 --> 00:33:36.291]  Our momentum on social media
[00:33:41.954 --> 00:33:43.014]  Which is what this is about.
[00:33:43.034 --> 00:33:50.977]  If you listen to Keir Starmer's address to the nation there, he doesn't talk about locking up the people who have committed criminality.
[00:33:51.697 --> 00:33:53.178]  He's coming for all of you.
[00:33:53.358 --> 00:33:54.838]  That's what he says, okay?
[00:33:55.278 --> 00:33:57.539]  And he implies, I believe and many others
[00:33:58.089 --> 00:33:59.691]  I believe he's talking to me.
[00:34:00.352 --> 00:34:01.974]  And we're going to get locked up as well.
[00:34:02.354 --> 00:34:03.435]  OK, so they've tried.
[00:34:03.756 --> 00:34:16.550]  All the media are saying that I've stoked, even though I'm very grateful that we have X. Because you see, if we didn't have X, I'd put out a video this morning, a three minute video, addressing the government, that this is not my fault.
[00:34:16.711 --> 00:34:17.832]  It's actually your fault.
[00:34:18.713 --> 00:34:20.014]  You're the one who opened the borders.
[00:34:20.334 --> 00:34:26.959]  Last week, a British pensioner, female, was beaten to death by two Somali migrants.
[00:34:27.319 --> 00:34:29.641]  You invited them into the country, not me.
[00:34:29.941 --> 00:34:44.453]  In the city of Hull, where they're currently rioting, in the city of Hull, where they rioted outside a migrant hotel, a migrant left that hotel, an asylum seeker, and stabbed a British pensioner to death while screaming it was for Palestine.
[00:34:45.013 --> 00:34:52.275]  In all the other cities where there's trouble today, Rotherham, local 12-year-old girls have been followed, harassed, sexually assaulted.
[00:34:52.615 --> 00:34:54.675]  In Yarmouth, they've left the hotels.
[00:34:54.695 --> 00:34:56.836]  These are the migrants being put into your community.
[00:34:57.116 --> 00:34:58.096]  They've left the hotel.
[00:34:58.296 --> 00:34:59.156]  They've raped women.
[00:34:59.396 --> 00:35:00.636]  In Oxford, they've raped women.
[00:35:01.016 --> 00:35:03.897]  Up and down our country, English women are being raped.
[00:35:04.237 --> 00:35:06.318]  Our daughters are no longer free to walk the streets.
[00:35:06.658 --> 00:35:08.238]  And when people come out on the streets,
[00:35:08.758 --> 00:35:15.163]  When they come out on the streets with Black Lives Matter, all the politicians and all the news said we need to understand why they're angry.
[00:35:15.784 --> 00:35:19.627]  Well there's no understanding on why the English are angry.
[00:35:19.907 --> 00:35:30.556]  What they've done is come out, declare war on the public and say get back in your box, shut your mouth, you're all far-right, you're all racist, you're all extremists and we're going to crush you.
[00:35:31.077 --> 00:35:32.878]  That's the message from Keir Starmer.
[00:35:33.138 --> 00:35:34.840]  Now Keir Starmer's message today
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.741]  I've put out videos, Alex.
[00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:37.801]  You can see the videos.
[00:35:38.021 --> 00:35:41.082]  There's no videos of Muslims getting beaten on the floor with sticks or bats.
[00:35:41.483 --> 00:35:46.424]  The videos are all of white English people being physically battered with weapons.
[00:35:46.685 --> 00:35:52.687]  There's videos of Muslims walking down the streets with swords, axes, baseball bats in front of the police.
[00:35:53.087 --> 00:35:53.947]  No arrests made.
[00:35:54.188 --> 00:35:58.990]  There's not one single bit of footage of the police hitting Muslims with their batons.
[00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:11.216]  All the footage is of the police setting dogs and attacking English people while Muslims have been given the free reign for the last two days up and down our country to charge through the streets and beat up any non-Muslims they find.
[00:36:11.496 --> 00:36:14.117]  And what does Keir Starmer address in his message?
[00:36:14.437 --> 00:36:17.439]  He doesn't say we're going to come down hard on the Muslim rioters
[00:36:18.303 --> 00:36:19.224]  And the non-Muslim writers.
[00:36:19.744 --> 00:36:20.505]  He just addressed it.
[00:36:20.685 --> 00:36:25.730]  He's coming down hard on the British public who are angry and who are engaging in acts of criminality.
[00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:31.315]  He then goes on to say to the Muslim community, as he did in the first one, we will protect you.
[00:36:32.036 --> 00:36:34.058]  We will we will protect your mosque.
[00:36:34.438 --> 00:36:37.101]  Well, I'm sorry, you haven't protected our daughters.
[00:36:38.234 --> 00:36:47.120]  And I am not guilty of inciting hatred or inciting violence by merely pointing out the government's total fuck-ups for 15 years.
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.522]  You failed, not us.
[00:36:49.902 --> 00:36:50.702]  You have failed.
[00:36:51.323 --> 00:36:58.588]  In the town of Rotherham today, where there were riots against the migrant hotel, in that town, 1,400 English girls were raped.
[00:37:01.142 --> 00:37:03.503]  1,400 someone murdered, OK?
[00:37:03.803 --> 00:37:11.666]  The government never come out, made videos like this, and said, we're going to clamp down, we're going to crush them, and never addressed English mothers.
[00:37:11.926 --> 00:37:12.966]  We will protect you.
[00:37:13.006 --> 00:37:13.886]  We will save you.
[00:37:14.206 --> 00:37:17.668]  The reason people are angry on the street is because they don't feel protected.
[00:37:18.028 --> 00:37:19.128]  They feel in fear.
[00:37:19.408 --> 00:37:20.749]  They're scared for their daughters.
[00:37:21.169 --> 00:37:27.611]  And the whole time, they're gaslit by the public, by the media, and by the politicians, somehow.
[00:37:28.371 --> 00:37:30.113]  Somehow, they're painting me up.
[00:37:30.153 --> 00:37:32.755]  I know what they're doing, so I can foresee what this is about.
[00:37:33.236 --> 00:37:36.579]  What this is about, we had a massive rally, 100,000 people.
[00:37:36.819 --> 00:37:38.861]  We have built momentum like never seen before.
[00:37:39.161 --> 00:37:42.043]  The entire world was watching London on the 27th of July.
[00:37:42.384 --> 00:37:52.633]  We have the ability to inspire a cultural revolution, not just in Britain, but across the entire West when they watch our momentum of what we're building.
[00:37:53.093 --> 00:37:54.274]  That terrifies them.
[00:37:54.574 --> 00:37:55.695]  So what do they have to do?
[00:37:55.955 --> 00:37:57.076]  They have to get rid of me.
[00:37:57.517 --> 00:38:05.583]  I played a film, it's now on 30 million views Alex, on X, it's my pinned tweet, at T Robinson New Era, watch that film.
[00:38:05.863 --> 00:38:11.988]  That film destroys the credibility of the judiciary, the weaponisation of the judiciary.
[00:38:12.228 --> 00:38:16.331]  They use the courts as weapons against dissident voices across the West.
[00:38:16.691 --> 00:38:17.692]  That film destroys
[00:38:18.676 --> 00:38:26.665]  They are building me up as the face of violence, even though every video I've made, they've had 2 million, 3 million, 4 million views.
[00:38:27.006 --> 00:38:37.798]  Each time I've talked to protesters going out in the streets, I've appealed for calm, said that please don't commit violence, do not attack individual police officers, because even though the police are oppressing us,
[00:38:38.794 --> 00:38:39.114]  I think?
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:57.422]  All the riots are going on, all the trouble's going on, and then they want me to be the fool guy.
[00:38:57.922 --> 00:39:17.729]  All I've done is act as a journalist, and as a responsible journalist, I investigate everything I put out, I appealed for calm in all these demonstrations, and the last two events I've held, Alex, have had over 130,000 people involved, and no arrests, no violence, no trouble, because we planned them, okay?
[00:39:18.369 --> 00:39:19.550]  What you're seeing now is not planned.
[00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:20.810]  It's like a rudderless ship.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:28.825]  It is chaos in every town and city, and what Keir Starmer has done is pour petrol on the fire.
[00:39:29.105 --> 00:39:30.506]  They're talking about me stoking up.
[00:39:30.786 --> 00:39:31.766]  They're saying I'm stoking up.
[00:39:31.906 --> 00:39:37.570]  All I'm sharing is what's happening in each town and city and explaining why the British public are angry, and giving them
[00:39:38.345 --> 00:39:42.506]  The reason why they're doing it and talking about it, whilst condemning the violence at the same time.
[00:39:42.526 --> 00:39:46.987]  Now what Keir Starmer's done, and what their government's policy is, is fail to listen.
[00:39:47.327 --> 00:39:54.249]  They could have come out and said, like they've done with Black Lives Matter, okay, they could have come out and said, we fully understand your fears.
[00:39:54.689 --> 00:39:56.530]  We understand your anger.
[00:39:56.730 --> 00:40:00.271]  We need to work together as a country to solve this.
[00:40:00.631 --> 00:40:01.031]  They didn't.
[00:40:01.611 --> 00:40:06.856]  They come out, they arrested nans, they arrested mums, they beat and threw English women on the floor.
[00:40:07.157 --> 00:40:13.042]  They tried to crush anyone standing up to talk about fears for their children.
[00:40:13.382 --> 00:40:14.724]  That's what they've done.
[00:40:14.964 --> 00:40:19.628]  And they've labelled every single person involved in any of these protests as far-right.
[00:40:19.969 --> 00:40:25.634]  I saw interviews with people today saying, if you're calling us far-right hooligans, we'll become far-right hooligans.
[00:40:26.114 --> 00:40:27.256]  I have not orchestrated.
[00:40:27.557 --> 00:40:29.459]  It's none of these demonstrations are my fault.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.761]  They're the government's fault.
[00:40:31.002 --> 00:40:32.184]  It's Keir Starmer's fault.
[00:40:32.444 --> 00:40:33.345]  He should resign.
[00:40:33.826 --> 00:40:37.512]  He is going to be a dictator and he's not even got the mandate.
[00:40:38.413 --> 00:40:39.795]  He was elected with 9 million votes.
[00:40:40.485 --> 00:40:50.907]  Eighteen percent of the vote he's got, eighteen percent of the British population voted for him, and he wants to come down and crush them, oppress them, label them, smear them, attack them.
[00:40:51.287 --> 00:40:53.848]  And Tommy, let me just walk this with you.
[00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:55.288]  This is very important.
[00:40:55.808 --> 00:40:58.929]  He announces, you know, we played it Friday, two days ago.
[00:40:59.749 --> 00:41:05.650]  He said we're going to use draconian anti-terror laws and we're going to surveil everybody and face everybody and lock everybody down.
[00:41:07.102 --> 00:41:10.723]  And said Muslims will protect you when no one had even rioted yet.
[00:41:11.364 --> 00:41:13.224]  Literally just trying to stir people up.
[00:41:13.665 --> 00:41:16.326]  And you've said that on your ex account that you believe he's stirring people up.
[00:41:16.346 --> 00:41:20.607]  Will you explain why you think he's doing that and what their endgame is and what you expect to happen next?
[00:41:20.627 --> 00:41:22.688]  Because you predicted last week this was going to happen.
[00:41:23.008 --> 00:41:24.429]  You told people not to get violent.
[00:41:24.689 --> 00:41:26.549]  But this is locals that are sick and tired of it.
[00:41:26.569 --> 00:41:27.330]  It has nothing to do with you.
[00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:30.531]  You have big organized demonstrations that are totally legal and totally lawful.
[00:41:32.068 --> 00:41:34.329]  They're going to use it as an excuse to absolutely crush me.
[00:41:34.729 --> 00:41:40.990]  It's like, Alex, if you saw the anti-Semitism rally I was reporting on in London, when I was unlawfully arrested.
[00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.731]  And I was arrested and I was pepper-sprayed from point-blank range.
[00:41:44.051 --> 00:41:45.531]  This was in November.
[00:41:45.831 --> 00:41:46.972]  It was November 26th, yeah?
[00:41:47.772 --> 00:41:52.593]  They attacked me and then they banned me from entering my capital city for six months.
[00:41:52.873 --> 00:42:00.135]  They'd done that because I was the one person that they saw that could galvanise the British public behind them to oppose the pro-Hamas rallies.
[00:42:00.595 --> 00:42:02.096]  They banned me for six months.
[00:42:02.156 --> 00:42:06.819]  They didn't just ban me, they used to get in their courts to prosecute me unlawfully.
[00:42:07.279 --> 00:42:09.661]  Everything they'd done was proven unlawful.
[00:42:09.921 --> 00:42:17.566]  The arrest was unlawful, the pepper spraying was unlawful, the bail conditions that banned me from my entire capital city were unlawful.
[00:42:18.627 --> 00:42:20.748]  We're at the next stage of them tactics.
[00:42:21.028 --> 00:42:25.551]  They're sitting now thinking, and this is proven by them digging up
[00:42:26.619 --> 00:42:35.096]  A dead organisation called the English Defence League, which hasn't protested, had meetings, had a membership for over a decade, Alex.
[00:42:35.456 --> 00:42:37.761]  And all of a sudden, every news article
[00:42:38.758 --> 00:42:45.202]  Every politician and every protester is called the English Defence League, and they're taught to prescribe as a terrorist organisation.
[00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:51.306]  I know, I know I'm paranoid, but just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're all out to get you, and they are all out to get us, yeah?
[00:42:51.726 --> 00:42:57.630]  So, they're building up the English Defence League... Yeah, well they're now kicking down doors of women they claim were at protests and dragging them out of the house.
[00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:58.731]  This is footage right here.
[00:42:59.915 --> 00:43:04.938]  They haven't kicked down the doors of the Romanians who were rioting in Harefield.
[00:43:05.338 --> 00:43:05.918]  All of this.
[00:43:05.938 --> 00:43:09.060]  They don't even want to talk about where this anger comes from.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.783]  They don't even want to address the driving forces that's bringing people out on the streets.
[00:43:14.083 --> 00:43:17.485]  They don't want to because if they do, they're all their failures.
[00:43:18.635 --> 00:43:19.396]  Every point of it.
[00:43:19.536 --> 00:43:20.597]  The way they've policed us.
[00:43:20.817 --> 00:43:22.579]  The way they let the Muslims off with only crimes.
[00:43:22.779 --> 00:43:24.841]  The way they've allowed a generation of our daughters to be raped.
[00:43:25.121 --> 00:43:26.622]  The way the borders are still open.
[00:43:26.882 --> 00:43:29.144]  The way people can't afford heating.
[00:43:29.385 --> 00:43:31.126]  The way people can't get dentist appointments.
[00:43:31.326 --> 00:43:32.548]  They're pulling their own teeth out.
[00:43:32.688 --> 00:43:36.171]  And who's put to the front of the queue for every single one of those issues?
[00:43:36.711 --> 00:43:42.273]  The Muslim migrants that are being imported, that are entering our country illegally, that they know nothing about.
[00:43:42.293 --> 00:43:44.433]  Alex, let me give you one example, yeah?
[00:43:44.994 --> 00:43:48.415]  One example, and I could give you an example like this for every town and city.
[00:43:48.755 --> 00:43:54.316]  There was a Muslim who came to the UK, he went to the city of Bournemouth, he said he was 15 years old when he got here.
[00:43:54.336 --> 00:43:55.377]  This is what they all do.
[00:43:55.677 --> 00:43:59.578]  They're taking up the places of vulnerable British children who need housing.
[00:43:59.958 --> 00:44:03.562]  They say they're children, he gets put in a house, he goes to school.
[00:44:03.582 --> 00:44:10.129]  Now when he's 20, so five years later, he stabs a Royal Marine soldier through the heart in the town centre.
[00:44:10.709 --> 00:44:15.875]  When he does that, they then find out he's not 20 years old, he's 26 years old.
[00:44:16.195 --> 00:44:18.077]  Which means when he comes to the school and was
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:19.942]  ...put into school with children.
[00:44:20.283 --> 00:44:21.745]  He wasn't 15, he was 21.
[00:44:21.805 --> 00:44:24.169]  They're endangering our daughters.
[00:44:24.549 --> 00:44:25.991]  Then do you know what else they found out?
[00:44:26.532 --> 00:44:31.119]  On his way to the UK, he shot two people dead with an AK-47 in Serbia.
[00:44:33.266 --> 00:44:41.670]  They put a killer who murdered two people with an AK-47, who's an adult man, in a school with our daughters.
[00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:44.811]  And this is happening up and down our whole country.
[00:44:45.371 --> 00:44:48.513]  And as soon as you try and talk about it, you're a far right racist.
[00:44:48.533 --> 00:44:56.356]  Well, I was about to say, this little hotel, this little town, has literally Islamic men from the third world harassing women, grooming, grabbing people.
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.060]  That has nothing to do with you.
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.101]  Those are people pissed off.
[00:44:59.141 --> 00:44:59.521]  Every hotel.
[00:44:59.841 --> 00:45:06.063]  Just like you 15 years ago when you saw the grooming gangs next to your business and started speaking out then and got attacked.
[00:45:06.464 --> 00:45:09.405]  They're on the same path you were on because they're under the same attack.
[00:45:12.266 --> 00:45:14.287]  Every hotel in every city, Alex.
[00:45:14.547 --> 00:45:18.048]  Now there were riots in Liverpool five, six months ago.
[00:45:19.019 --> 00:45:28.485]  Nothing to do with me, because the Muslims in the hotels harassed young schoolgirls that had been filmed on camera, and all the local men went up there, rioted, they all got put in jail.
[00:45:28.885 --> 00:45:38.111]  They blamed it on the far-right, the imaginary far-right again, because they want to blame the bogey group rather than accept it's the British public.
[00:45:38.391 --> 00:45:44.055]  What you're witnessing now in hotels and trouble across every city in our country
[00:45:45.026 --> 00:45:45.926]  It's the British public!
[00:45:46.226 --> 00:45:47.387]  It's the average British man!
[00:45:47.767 --> 00:45:50.388]  It's not ideologically... They're not ideologically driven.
[00:45:50.868 --> 00:45:59.930]  They're just hard-working family men whose daughters aren't safe, whose wives are being harassed, who are sending a message to the establishment, but the establishment won't listen.
[00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:01.451]  They won't talk to them.
[00:46:01.651 --> 00:46:05.152]  They won't even accept... And by the way, it's all over Europe.
[00:46:05.192 --> 00:46:10.934]  They admit something like 80% of the crime, the rape, in Germany and in Sweden is the Islamists.
[00:46:11.014 --> 00:46:12.174]  I mean, this is what they do.
[00:46:13.054 --> 00:46:17.375]  And it's a bunch of military men arriving daily in boats and coming across the borders.
[00:46:17.855 --> 00:46:19.696]  It's just absolutely insane.
[00:46:19.716 --> 00:46:23.177]  So in the time we have left, you called this week and said, I want peace.
[00:46:24.017 --> 00:46:24.957]  This is going to blow up.
[00:46:25.418 --> 00:46:26.378]  Now they're trying to blame you.
[00:46:26.458 --> 00:46:27.798]  What do you predict next?
[00:46:28.278 --> 00:46:36.681]  Because it looks like everything this prime minister is doing is trying to stir people up to create an open civil war so they can bring in martial law.
[00:46:36.701 --> 00:46:37.221]  Do you agree with that?
[00:46:40.024 --> 00:46:43.527]  They gave the Muslims free run of the towns for two or three days.
[00:46:43.887 --> 00:46:49.490]  Now you see the videos that are being shared on X in a minute of English people being beaten with baseball bats, poles, hammers, yeah?
[00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:50.471]  On the floor.
[00:46:50.951 --> 00:46:54.373]  If there was no X, no one would even see this.
[00:46:55.233 --> 00:46:56.214]  The media have not run them.
[00:46:56.694 --> 00:46:57.755]  No one else has reported them.
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:00.521]  They're banned from all other social media platforms.
[00:47:01.022 --> 00:47:04.084]  Literally, go and search my name on TikTok, no results come up.
[00:47:04.425 --> 00:47:06.566]  Go and search it on Instagram, no results.
[00:47:06.786 --> 00:47:11.130]  They have total control of all other big tech social media.
[00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:15.353]  And for those that don't know, you posted dozens today, I posted dozens.
[00:47:15.774 --> 00:47:17.315]  There are so many videos of men with
[00:47:17.495 --> 00:47:28.737]  Axes, hammers, knives, stabbing, attacking any white person that's attacked, pulling white people out of their cars, and then the national media shows one group of whites pulling a Muslim out of a car, and I think that's wrong to randomly attack a Muslim.
[00:47:29.137 --> 00:47:32.078]  But the point is, is that, is it the attack?
[00:47:32.398 --> 00:47:34.098]  The Muslims know they've been given free reign.
[00:47:34.138 --> 00:47:35.619]  What do you think the endgame is here?
[00:47:37.379 --> 00:47:41.260]  The endgame is total anarchy, and the endgame is to lock up everyone who's opposed to mass immigration.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:45.501]  So the endgame, the jihadists aren't the target.
[00:47:46.161 --> 00:47:46.421]  We are.
[00:47:47.648 --> 00:47:49.889]  The jihadists are not the target, okay?
[00:47:50.449 --> 00:47:55.311]  All of the criminals come in, all those men running around with knives, don't you saw all the weapons?
[00:47:55.571 --> 00:47:56.451]  There's been no arrests!
[00:47:57.332 --> 00:47:57.952]  No arrests!
[00:47:58.272 --> 00:48:03.774]  Our Prime Minister's not letting the rest of our country know, don't worry, we're going to get them, yeah?
[00:48:04.334 --> 00:48:06.695]  He's telling them, he's telling them, don't worry, they're going to get us!
[00:48:07.155 --> 00:48:08.896]  We're talking about it!
[00:48:08.936 --> 00:48:10.256]  Even the ones who aren't acting violently!
[00:48:10.276 --> 00:48:12.217]  And let's be clear, you posted videos today
[00:48:12.935 --> 00:48:30.966]  Where it'll show 500 or so Islamic men, they're all in black, with hatchets, and knives, and axes, and hammers, and poles, and baseball bats, rushing down to attack peaceful British protesters, and the police just stand there and watch, and then later attack women with police dogs that are British.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.481]  That's basically, it's in, but the whole country's watching now.
[00:48:35.801 --> 00:48:39.143]  This is why Elon Musk will be such a target.
[00:48:39.443 --> 00:48:49.607]  I believe the objective of our current government, I saw on Sky News earlier, they said on Sky News, all of this has stemmed from when Tommy Robinson was allowed back on X. It's like, what?
[00:48:50.387 --> 00:48:52.608]  All of this build up, and I've seen it before.
[00:48:53.128 --> 00:48:58.330]  In fact, in the film that I've made, which is called Silence, pinned on my X account,
[00:48:59.218 --> 00:49:00.019]  We showed air.
[00:49:00.299 --> 00:49:06.606]  They fabricated an entire event and the purpose of it was to get me removed off of YouTube and they were successful.
[00:49:07.006 --> 00:49:18.378]  They are going to build up so much pressure to put on Elon Musk to make claims of inciting violence, which is nonsense, or misinformation, which is nonsense, but they're going to put so much pressure.
[00:49:19.321 --> 00:49:22.746]  ...using their weaponised media in an attack.
[00:49:23.087 --> 00:49:27.214]  Now, you see, even Alex, I'm away now with my children, okay?
[00:49:27.274 --> 00:49:28.235]  I live under death threat.
[00:49:28.556 --> 00:49:29.758]  I've got three children with me.
[00:49:30.367 --> 00:49:42.014]  I'm away, and I've been here two days, and now they've run a big newspaper article, the Daily Mail have, they've used their ex-account to dox exactly where I am located.
[00:49:42.234 --> 00:49:43.535]  It's gone out four or five hours ago.
[00:49:43.875 --> 00:49:58.324]  So, exactly where I am located, with my children, they say in the article I'm with my children, Muslims have already put videos up now online saying people need to go and get him in Cyprus, we know where he is, because they don't ever know where I am, because I don't live in the same
[00:49:58.684 --> 00:50:00.124]  And people don't know what this is like.
[00:50:00.164 --> 00:50:12.747]  This has happened to me, like when my wife's dad, he's dead now, had a heart attack a year and a half ago in Omaha, and they put on the front page of the paper and all the TV channels where I was, and people came there to attack me.
[00:50:13.447 --> 00:50:14.448]  And that's nothing compared to you.
[00:50:14.468 --> 00:50:15.288]  These are Islamists.
[00:50:15.308 --> 00:50:16.388]  They are literally trying to kill you.
[00:50:17.648 --> 00:50:18.428]  They do it intentionally.
[00:50:18.889 --> 00:50:23.750]  So this is intentional by the Daily Mail to endanger the lives of my family.
[00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:25.250]  And that's what they've done.
[00:50:26.488 --> 00:50:46.478]  And all of this is coming, so the English Defence League reborn from the dead, the newspapers, Tommy Robertson's stoked riots from Cyprus, all of this together is a total attack because on the 27th of July we conducted ourselves impeccably with 100,000 men.
[00:50:48.426 --> 00:50:52.048]  We put the fear of God into the establishment.
[00:50:52.348 --> 00:50:54.249]  A movement like they've never witnessed.
[00:50:54.690 --> 00:51:02.514]  A proud, patriotic, country-loving, freedom-loving, Christian-loving movement has been born in the UK.
[00:51:03.074 --> 00:51:04.595]  And that has put the fear of God in them.
[00:51:05.103 --> 00:51:09.326]  So they have been, since that day, on a full-on attack.
[00:51:09.726 --> 00:51:10.527]  An onslaught.
[00:51:10.947 --> 00:51:17.432]  And if I didn't have an ex-account to be able to make videos, if you wasn't around anymore, Alex, remember we were in the shadows, bro.
[00:51:17.672 --> 00:51:19.513]  We were both in the shadows.
[00:51:19.733 --> 00:51:20.614]  And we were hidden.
[00:51:20.794 --> 00:51:21.194]  Anyone.
[00:51:21.314 --> 00:51:21.735]  All of us.
[00:51:22.015 --> 00:51:23.816]  We were censored, deplatformed, deleted.
[00:51:24.036 --> 00:51:25.838]  They had total control for five years.
[00:51:26.098 --> 00:51:26.978]  They could tell everyone.
[00:51:27.219 --> 00:51:28.480]  All the headlines they're running now.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.061]  Tommy Robinson incites violence.
[00:51:30.101 --> 00:51:32.803]  Tommy Robinson organises violent protests.
[00:51:33.263 --> 00:51:34.504]  The public would believe that.
[00:51:34.964 --> 00:51:41.168]  But I've now got an account where I can make videos and reach millions in days so the public can see their lies.
[00:51:41.448 --> 00:51:44.951]  So at the minute, go on the Daily Mail article today and read the comments.
[00:51:45.451 --> 00:51:47.912]  Every single one of them is against the Daily Mail and for us.
[00:51:47.932 --> 00:51:48.273]  That's right.
[00:51:48.293 --> 00:51:51.915]  Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, it's late at night.
[00:51:52.195 --> 00:51:56.078]  You're so gracious at 10 o'clock at night in Cyprus to come on with us.
[00:51:56.158 --> 00:51:57.379]  We're going to do a two-minute break.
[00:51:57.399 --> 00:52:03.142]  I'm going to come right back with five more minutes for you then to move on to what you believe is going to happen next because you've been dead on.
[00:52:03.202 --> 00:52:04.083]  People should follow you.
[00:52:05.015 --> 00:52:07.538]  Right now on X at Tommy Robinson New Era.
[00:52:07.558 --> 00:52:08.539]  They should see your film.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.061]  This is amazing.
[00:52:10.161 --> 00:52:11.983]  You're so gracious to be here with us right now.
[00:52:12.003 --> 00:52:16.568]  We're going to go to break and come back and start the next hour in T-minus two minutes.
[00:52:16.649 --> 00:52:18.150]  And hopefully you can join me again tomorrow.
[00:52:18.471 --> 00:52:20.633]  And hopefully you move out of that hotel tomorrow morning.
[00:52:21.014 --> 00:52:21.714]  We'll be right back.
[00:52:21.734 --> 00:52:22.095]  Stay with us.
[00:52:25.626 --> 00:52:30.930]  So, there's the InfoWars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:38.455]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's salt palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[00:52:38.836 --> 00:52:42.538]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[00:52:42.598 --> 00:52:43.879]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[00:52:43.899 --> 00:52:53.946]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWars MD.
[00:52:56.047 --> 00:53:08.354]  If you don't back President Trump, if you don't back people like Victor Orban, if you don't back people like Elon Musk and Alex Jones and Tommy Robinson, you're not in the fight.
[00:53:08.795 --> 00:53:12.357]  Now, Tommy didn't ask me to do this, but during the break I asked him, I said, how are you doing?
[00:53:13.214 --> 00:53:14.555]  He said, they bankrupted me.
[00:53:14.615 --> 00:53:15.996]  I'm just, you know, on the ropes.
[00:53:16.276 --> 00:53:19.197]  I'm, you know, basically just hanging out with family right now, figuring what we're going to do.
[00:53:19.217 --> 00:53:21.939]  And I said, people need to donate to Tommy Robinson right now.
[00:53:22.219 --> 00:53:23.660]  They've been a public enemy, number one.
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:24.440]  They need to support him.
[00:53:24.721 --> 00:53:26.462]  I want to get a final comment from you.
[00:53:26.482 --> 00:53:31.144]  You said you'd probably join us tomorrow, but you've got to leave, obviously, move hotels, where your records are coming to kill you.
[00:53:31.184 --> 00:53:31.765]  They've said they are.
[00:53:32.565 --> 00:53:34.866]  But just how do people support you?
[00:53:34.946 --> 00:53:37.488]  Is it T. Robinson, New Era?
[00:53:37.908 --> 00:53:39.269]  Is it Urban Scoop News?
[00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:40.549]  Is it HelpTommy.com?
[00:53:40.589 --> 00:53:41.310]  How do we support you?
[00:53:43.405 --> 00:53:47.547]  It's urbanscoop.news forward slash support dash us.
[00:53:48.167 --> 00:53:51.588]  So the link is in my bio on my Twitter handle.
[00:53:52.129 --> 00:53:55.350]  It's to support us because that doesn't just support us.
[00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:57.951]  The company I work for support me through everything.
[00:53:58.957 --> 00:53:59.658]  Legal battles.
[00:53:59.958 --> 00:54:01.559]  As I said, I'm staying out.
[00:54:01.899 --> 00:54:02.880]  I've got leave.
[00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:03.901]  There's 18 of us here.
[00:54:04.481 --> 00:54:06.843]  18 of us, and this is the third day of our holiday.
[00:54:07.123 --> 00:54:08.705]  And I've waited a year for this with my kids.
[00:54:09.305 --> 00:54:10.246]  I've waited a year for my kids.
[00:54:10.286 --> 00:54:16.471]  I've had my kids sat crying, saying to people, because there's videos online of Muslims saying to come to the hotel where we're at.
[00:54:16.851 --> 00:54:20.014]  And even if they're not coming, it's ruined it for my children.
[00:54:20.034 --> 00:54:21.515]  My children are passing and looking around.
[00:54:21.535 --> 00:54:22.435]  They're coming for sure.
[00:54:24.797 --> 00:54:26.899]  So I've got a meeting with the manager here in the morning.
[00:54:27.512 --> 00:54:28.713]  But it's just on my head then, man.
[00:54:28.753 --> 00:54:32.654]  So, anyone who can support us who doesn't support me, it supports the incredible work we do.
[00:54:32.674 --> 00:54:33.775]  We do incredible journalism.
[00:54:46.798 --> 00:54:47.659]  Two and a half minutes left.
[00:54:47.719 --> 00:54:48.679]  You may be able to join us tomorrow.
[00:54:48.699 --> 00:54:52.001]  You said you can, but whatever you need to do on my live show.
[00:54:52.021 --> 00:54:54.122]  But just in closing, what comes next?
[00:54:54.143 --> 00:54:55.423]  You predicted this in the UK.
[00:54:55.463 --> 00:54:56.224]  You called for peace.
[00:54:57.164 --> 00:54:58.345]  The public's enraged.
[00:54:58.725 --> 00:55:00.386]  Everything the Prime Minister's doing is going to backfire.
[00:55:00.666 --> 00:55:01.727]  What do you expect to happen now?
[00:55:01.767 --> 00:55:04.609]  Sadiq Khan is calling for, you know, everybody's arrest right now.
[00:55:06.782 --> 00:55:07.602]  I'll be in jail, Alex.
[00:55:08.022 --> 00:55:08.743]  That's what comes next.
[00:55:09.203 --> 00:55:11.264]  So, do you know what?
[00:55:11.444 --> 00:55:12.864]  I think it'll be the worst thing they can do.
[00:55:14.024 --> 00:55:15.385]  It'll galvanise our support.
[00:55:15.405 --> 00:55:16.345]  People ain't backing down.
[00:55:16.905 --> 00:55:18.566]  If they haven't seen that, they've tried to crush them.
[00:55:18.846 --> 00:55:20.566]  The protests have got bigger, they've got more violent.
[00:55:20.907 --> 00:55:21.827]  People aren't backing down.
[00:55:22.727 --> 00:55:28.549]  And whilst we've directed people peacefully, and with our movement our numbers were growing, our next one would have a quarter of a million.
[00:55:29.585 --> 00:55:30.686]  After that I'll be half a million.
[00:55:30.946 --> 00:55:37.012]  There's a revolution brewing in Great Britain and I've made video after video saying it needs to be peaceful, not violent.
[00:55:37.392 --> 00:55:39.034]  But people are not backing down.
[00:55:39.454 --> 00:55:42.657]  We're losing our country, we're losing our culture, we're losing our identity.
[00:55:42.977 --> 00:55:50.504]  A thousand years of English history, we're not giving it away because of weak, cowardly, globalist politicians who wish to destroy and take over this nation.
[00:55:50.725 --> 00:55:51.706]  We're not giving it away.
[00:55:52.046 --> 00:55:53.387]  So people are not going to back down.
[00:55:53.687 --> 00:55:55.249]  And I keep thinking, if they think
[00:55:55.871 --> 00:56:02.015]  But the problem, the concern of it, I'm obviously facing a court case for the film I've made where I face two years in prison.
[00:56:02.656 --> 00:56:07.579]  If they think that's going to stop this, it's going to galvanise my support bigger than ever before.
[00:56:08.099 --> 00:56:10.501]  It's going to double the viewings on my film.
[00:56:10.821 --> 00:56:18.506]  So, but when you ask what's come next, that is honestly what I see is coming next, which is why I've come here for a two week, which is why I had a two week holiday book.
[00:56:19.011 --> 00:56:20.312]  Well that was my final point.
[00:56:20.572 --> 00:56:22.755]  We'll talk about it tomorrow, Tommy.
[00:56:22.775 --> 00:56:25.977]  They've done something nobody could do in 800 years.
[00:56:25.997 --> 00:56:27.559]  They've unified the Irish, the Scots and the English.
[00:56:43.379 --> 00:56:43.759]  They have.
[00:56:43.799 --> 00:56:45.680]  The Northern Irish with the Republicans.
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:55.104]  Yesterday you saw loyalists and Republicans who have been at war for a hundred years with each other marching together, uniting together.
[00:56:55.404 --> 00:56:56.845]  Belfast burned last night.
[00:56:57.105 --> 00:56:58.346]  Many parts of Belfast...
[00:56:59.046 --> 00:57:01.890]  Many migrant businesses or hotels were set fire to.
[00:57:02.251 --> 00:57:03.392]  There are clashes coming.
[00:57:03.693 --> 00:57:15.830]  And unfortunately, what our government, the message our government have sent since Black Lives Matter, since the Muslim riots, since the Romanian riots, is he who riots, he who's violent, and he who's the loudest is who will listen.
[00:57:16.463 --> 00:57:17.703]  That's the message they've sent.
[00:57:18.164 --> 00:57:22.045]  So unfortunately, lots of young men whose lives are going to be destroyed now.
[00:57:22.085 --> 00:57:23.486]  Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.
[00:57:23.666 --> 00:57:24.466]  We'll talk to you in the morning.
[00:57:24.486 --> 00:57:25.506]  Let me say bye to you right now.
[00:57:25.746 --> 00:57:26.787]  Let's book a time to be on.
[00:57:26.827 --> 00:57:27.667]  We'll all pray for you.
[00:57:27.947 --> 00:57:28.427]  God bless you.
[00:57:28.467 --> 00:57:29.328]  We're so proud of you.
[00:57:29.668 --> 00:57:30.408]  Stay with us, folks.
[00:57:30.428 --> 00:57:30.948]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:37.791]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:37.911 --> 00:57:42.652]  I am Chase Geiser, your host for the next several hours until eight o'clock central.
[00:57:42.672 --> 00:57:43.833]  We are going to be covering the news
[00:57:45.090 --> 00:57:47.807]  And taking calls on the final hour of the show today as well.
[00:57:48.735 --> 00:57:55.217]  There's basically three big things that are going on as far as I can tell in the news in the last 24 to 48 hours.
[00:57:55.237 --> 00:58:06.442]  There's this escalation with Iran that's taking place right before our eyes while we see leftists and rhinos alike rally support for antagonism toward Iran, which would inevitably lead to World War III.
[00:58:07.302 --> 00:58:15.105]  There is civil unrest, which seems like it might lead to all-out civil war based on the rhetoric from all parties involved.
[00:58:15.905 --> 00:58:42.712]  happening in the UK and the surrounding region as well because of their migrant policies which have culminated reached a critical mass where now there's no turning back there's so much violence there's so much rioting there's so much crime that's being committed by these refugees that they've taken into these countries because they've sold out their own national sovereignty for the sake of a globalist agenda the beta test of the new world order was and is the European Union
[00:58:44.386 --> 00:58:49.682]  And despite this Brexit that we saw happen and this reclamation of
[00:58:51.803 --> 00:59:06.573]  Britain's national sovereignty, they still suffer at the hands of globalist leaders, mayors, prime ministers, others, who have sold out to the globalist agenda and allowed the invasion of their country by people who refuse to assimilate to their culture.
[00:59:07.253 --> 00:59:17.901]  They have mixed incompatible cultures together with one another, just like if you were a chef and you mixed incompatible ingredients that weren't meant to work in harmony and
[00:59:19.403 --> 00:59:20.043]  We're good to go.
[00:59:46.796 --> 01:00:06.377]  Are going so viral so consistently with clip after clip just showing how much of an utter moron Kamala Harris is that I think it might actually result in a major dive in the polls to the extent that the polls have any semblance of honesty left in them.
[01:00:07.475 --> 01:00:08.496]  So I think they fix the polls.
[01:00:08.516 --> 01:00:12.718]  I think they massage the polls, inflate the polls, and cheat in the polls just like they cheat in elections.
[01:00:13.158 --> 01:00:16.020]  But there's got to be some element of truth in these polls, right?
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.660]  Unless they're just throwing out numbers that they made up.
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:20.822]  Unless they just haven't even conducted a poll at all and they're just making things up.
[01:00:21.062 --> 01:00:28.626]  But if there's any semblance of reality reflected in these polls, I think we are going to see this honeymoon phase of Kamala Harris end.
[01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:31.288]  We're going to see a deep dive.
[01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:37.178]  In her support, and there's still, I'm telling you folks, there's still a chance that they replace her.
[01:00:37.338 --> 01:00:44.609]  And I know that she's secured the necessary delegates for the nomination, and they're gonna have this virtual thing coming right up.
[01:00:45.851 --> 01:00:48.333]  But it's not over until the fat lady sings.
[01:00:48.393 --> 01:00:52.235]  I mean, Joe Biden had enough delegates to be the candidate as well, and they managed to get him out.
[01:00:52.275 --> 01:00:53.296]  So we'll see what happens.
[01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:54.777]  But I do want to run this clip.
[01:00:54.797 --> 01:00:55.878]  This is clip number 44.
[01:00:55.938 --> 01:01:02.663]  This is Michael Malice's appearance in a culmination, a compilation of some other clips on the Joe Rogan experience this week.
[01:01:03.123 --> 01:01:03.984]  He did a great job.
[01:01:04.004 --> 01:01:07.946]  It was, I think, my favorite interview I've ever seen Michael Malice do was this most recent one.
[01:01:08.927 --> 01:01:10.748]  And this has been going viral for good reason.
[01:01:10.768 --> 01:01:11.289]  Let's watch clip 44.
[01:01:16.511 --> 01:01:18.534]  ...you're either racist or sexist or ableist.
[01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:18.935]  Right.
[01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:20.117]  So they will use... Ableist?
[01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:21.078]  Yeah, because she's a retard.
[01:01:21.098 --> 01:01:22.120]  Jesus Christ!
[01:01:22.441 --> 01:01:23.302]  She's literally retarded.
[01:01:23.322 --> 01:01:23.482]  I mean...
[01:01:25.925 --> 01:01:35.689]  Ukraine is a country in Europe and Russia is another country and a powerful country and Russia invaded Ukraine and that's wrong.
[01:01:36.049 --> 01:01:39.711]  Ukraine is a country in Europe.
[01:01:40.211 --> 01:01:43.352]  It exists next to another country called Russia.
[01:01:43.592 --> 01:01:45.133]  Russia is a bigger country.
[01:01:45.313 --> 01:01:46.773]  Russia is a powerful country.
[01:01:46.933 --> 01:01:50.475]  Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine.
[01:01:50.755 --> 01:01:52.976]  So basically that's wrong.
[01:01:53.948 --> 01:01:55.709]  I think of her as America's wine mom.
[01:01:55.889 --> 01:01:58.791]  Because bitch seems like she's three deep by noon.
[01:01:59.371 --> 01:02:01.412]  And she's got the three phases of wine mom.
[01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:02.793]  She's got happy drunk.
[01:02:03.033 --> 01:02:04.054]  Oh my god!
[01:02:04.134 --> 01:02:06.055]  This cereal's got a rabbit on it!
[01:02:06.115 --> 01:02:06.936]  It's so great!
[01:02:07.016 --> 01:02:08.176]  Cackling, cackling, cackling.
[01:02:08.196 --> 01:02:10.178]  Look at my bus!
[01:02:10.338 --> 01:02:12.579]  Oh my god, I love it!
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.001]  Oh wow!
[01:02:16.261 --> 01:02:18.082]  Look at the bus!
[01:02:18.162 --> 01:02:20.284]  Rails on the bus go round and round.
[01:02:20.324 --> 01:02:20.684]  What?
[01:02:22.162 --> 01:02:26.645]  Then there is um trying to drunk at work where you're trying to make sense but you don't.
[01:02:26.805 --> 01:02:31.908]  Space is around us all and unites us all and inspires us all.
[01:02:31.928 --> 01:02:33.629]  Is it time?
[01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:40.153]  It is time for us to do what we have been doing and that time is every day.
[01:02:41.654 --> 01:02:44.536]  Every day it is time for us to agree.
[01:02:44.556 --> 01:02:45.677]  Space is exciting!
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:54.725]  It spurs our imaginations and it forces us to ask big questions.
[01:02:56.066 --> 01:03:02.891]  Space, it affects us all and it connects us all.
[01:03:03.131 --> 01:03:07.654]  I'm being stern so you don't realize how plastered I am and I'm making a point.
[01:03:07.774 --> 01:03:08.915]  Dr. Little Girl was me.
[01:03:09.175 --> 01:03:12.117]  Now I'm going to go upstairs and don't knock on the door because I'm going to pass out.
[01:03:13.306 --> 01:03:20.571]  And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools.
[01:03:21.111 --> 01:03:23.332]  And she was bused to school every day.
[01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:25.614]  And that little girl was me.
[01:03:27.975 --> 01:03:28.956]  We are going to the border.
[01:03:29.036 --> 01:03:29.957]  We've been to the border.
[01:03:30.297 --> 01:03:34.680]  So this whole, this whole, this whole thing about the border, we've been to the border.
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:36.181]  We've been to the border.
[01:03:36.201 --> 01:03:37.121]  You haven't been to the border.
[01:03:38.362 --> 01:03:39.623]  And I haven't been to Europe.
[01:03:41.886 --> 01:03:44.687]  So we see that she's absolutely a moron.
[01:03:44.707 --> 01:03:51.930]  We knew this, but we're going to emphasize this incessantly until the race is won and the country is seized and saved and retaken by patriots.
[01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:54.691]  And we had this week, this all just developed so quickly.
[01:03:55.834 --> 01:04:10.961]  We have this week, Trump agreeing to a Fox debate with Kamala Harris after they came out repeatedly and said that he was scared to debate her, that he wouldn't actually debate her, that he was backing out or he was refusing, saying that he wouldn't because he was scared, he knew that he would lose.
[01:04:10.981 --> 01:04:15.384]  That's what they said before the June 27th debate as well, which ended up not being true at all.
[01:04:16.004 --> 01:04:20.866]  And they even had leaders of the Democratic Party coming out and speaking at rallies, making these claims.
[01:04:20.886 --> 01:04:22.127]  Let's run clip 18 real quick.
[01:04:27.981 --> 01:04:35.806]  Don't know if y'all heard about it, but apparently Donald Trump is too scared to debate the Vice President.
[01:04:41.169 --> 01:04:44.271]  And it's met with cheers and cheers, and that's the essence of the clip.
[01:04:46.263 --> 01:04:47.424]  But she refuses the debate.
[01:04:47.564 --> 01:04:50.866]  Kamala Harris now has refused the Fox News debate against Trump.
[01:04:51.006 --> 01:04:56.710]  The Harris campaign is apparently refusing to debate Donald Trump on Fox News, which the former president announced on Friday.
[01:04:57.330 --> 01:05:05.175]  Trump on Truth Social said he agreed to a debate against Harris with Fox News on Wednesday, September 4th, before a live primetime audience.
[01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:09.694]  And she's come out and refused after they taunted him and teased him.
[01:05:09.714 --> 01:05:19.586]  The Harry Sissons, the Krasensteins, these leaders at these rallies just incessantly antagonized the Trump campaign claiming that he was too scared to debate her.
[01:05:19.887 --> 01:05:22.069]  Now she's backing out and they're radio silent about it.
[01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:23.712]  Oh, it wouldn't be fair if it's on Fox News.
[01:05:23.732 --> 01:05:25.093]  Yeah, you think a CNN debate is fair?
[01:05:26.118 --> 01:05:34.884]  Do you think any of these debates are fair when they're moderated by these deep state cucks that act as pundits on these major networks which are influenced by the CIA?
[01:05:34.924 --> 01:05:37.886]  It's well documented all the way going back to Project Mockingbird.
[01:05:38.407 --> 01:05:41.028]  You think Donald Trump is afraid?
[01:05:41.068 --> 01:05:41.309]  Listen.
[01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:44.267]  There's a lot of reasons to criticize Donald Trump.
[01:05:44.567 --> 01:05:49.411]  Most of the criticism, 99% of the criticism I see of Donald Trump, I don't agree with.
[01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:52.914]  I have some problems with warp speed and some of the vaccine decisions that he made.
[01:05:52.954 --> 01:06:01.100]  I think he made some mistakes in the people that he chose to surround himself with, people that he did not fire, people that he did fire that he shouldn't have fired, like the Steve Bannons and others.
[01:06:01.961 --> 01:06:11.148]  And I understand that Donald Trump is not perfect, but nobody with any rational thinking, rational mind,
[01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:20.254]  Would ever use the word afraid or cowardly or fearful to describe Donald Trump.
[01:06:21.335 --> 01:06:22.676]  You could say he's an egomaniac.
[01:06:22.716 --> 01:06:31.543]  You could say he's crass or rash or reckless or just a celebrity or a bad businessman.
[01:06:32.003 --> 01:06:33.304]  These are things that I disagree with.
[01:06:33.384 --> 01:06:38.908]  But you can make those accusations and support it with evidence, whether it's clips or statements or decisions that he's made.
[01:06:39.208 --> 01:06:41.050]  You can try to make a case for those things.
[01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:45.772]  But to say that he's afraid of Kamala Harris is an absolute joke.
[01:06:45.812 --> 01:07:00.861]  I mean, I'm not going to run the clip because you've seen it a number of times, but even after the June 27th debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, when the golf cart video leaked, so-called leaked, saying that Trump saying in the golf cart that Joe Biden was going to back out and it was going to be Kamala.
[01:07:00.901 --> 01:07:06.664]  And he was saying this is great news because she's an even worse candidate than Joe Biden, who doesn't even have a mind.
[01:07:07.324 --> 01:07:11.129]  This is not a man who is afraid of Kamala Harris, please.
[01:07:11.149 --> 01:07:15.414]  He's debated time and time again on the primary stage against dozens of people.
[01:07:15.694 --> 01:07:16.976]  He's debated numerous times.
[01:07:16.996 --> 01:07:18.438]  He's not afraid to do it.
[01:07:18.638 --> 01:07:24.325]  The only reason he would make the decision not to do it is if for some reason it could only disproportionately benefit her.
[01:07:27.185 --> 01:07:39.811]  And I'm sorry, but the man who gets shot in the face and gets up and raises his fist and yells, fight, fight, fight, is not a man who would back out of a debate with Kamala because he's worried or concerned or fearful or cowardly, all right?
[01:07:39.851 --> 01:07:41.212]  Say what you will about Donald Trump.
[01:07:41.492 --> 01:07:44.914]  Criticize him all you want, but don't call him a coward.
[01:07:44.934 --> 01:07:47.355]  That's just absolutely ridiculous.
[01:07:48.316 --> 01:07:52.738]  Donald Trump has responded to Kamala Harris's backing out.
[01:07:52.758 --> 01:07:56.240]  Trump responds to Kamala's refusal to debate on Fox.
[01:07:57.523 --> 01:08:00.966]  Says, quote, doesn't have the mental capacity to do a real debate against me.
[01:08:01.486 --> 01:08:09.733]  Former President Donald Trump responded to the Harris campaign's refusal to agree to a debate with him on Fox News, declaring, I'll see her on September 4th or I won't see her at all.
[01:08:10.174 --> 01:08:16.979]  Kamala Harris doesn't have the mental capacity to do a real debate against me scheduled for September 4th in Pennsylvania, Trump wrote Saturday on Truth Social.
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:25.727]  She's afraid to do it because there is no way she can justify her corrupt and open borders, the environmental destruction of our country, the Afghanistan embarrassment.
[01:08:26.207 --> 01:08:34.551]  Runaway inflation, terrible economy, high interest rates and taxes, and her years-long fight to stop the words Merry Christmas.
[01:08:34.571 --> 01:08:36.973]  So let's dive in to some of these clips about that.
[01:08:37.013 --> 01:08:38.734]  First I'm going to run clip number three here.
[01:08:39.034 --> 01:08:44.757]  This is Kamala Harris saying how she would fight against the inflation issue.
[01:08:44.777 --> 01:08:45.897]  Go ahead and run clip three, please.
[01:08:46.578 --> 01:08:49.939]  What else are you going to do to fix this problem with inflation?
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:50.900]  Thank you.
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.561]  Well, let's start with this.
[01:08:56.686 --> 01:08:58.188]  Prices have gone up.
[01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:10.559]  And families and individuals are dealing with the realities of that bread costs more, that gas costs more.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:13.561]  And we have to understand what that means.
[01:09:14.402 --> 01:09:16.644]  That's about the cost of living going up.
[01:09:17.485 --> 01:09:22.149]  That's about having to stress and stretch limited resources.
[01:09:22.799 --> 01:09:31.426]  That's about a source of stress for families that is not only economic, but is on a daily level something that is a heavy weight to carry.
[01:09:31.666 --> 01:09:33.668]  So it is something that we take very seriously.
[01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:35.410]  Very seriously.
[01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:46.639]  And we know from the history of this issue in the United States that when you see these prices go up, it has a direct impact on the quality of life for all people in our country.
[01:09:47.019 --> 01:09:49.021]  So it's a big issue, and we take it seriously.
[01:09:49.582 --> 01:09:51.023]  And it is a priority, therefore.
[01:09:52.509 --> 01:09:54.190]  She's just a babbling buffoon.
[01:09:54.711 --> 01:10:01.755]  She's clearly not of the caliber of intelligence that the President of the United States needs to be in order to effectively do the job.
[01:10:02.776 --> 01:10:10.001]  I mean, I'm old enough to remember as an American when at least our opponents, these villains, were intelligent people.
[01:10:10.677 --> 01:10:18.419]  Barack Obama, say all you will about him, say what you will about Big Mike, say what you will about whether he was a deep state plant or even eligible to be the President of the United States, whether he was corrupt or sold us out.
[01:10:18.659 --> 01:10:20.159]  You can criticize Barack Obama all day.
[01:10:20.179 --> 01:10:21.720]  There's plenty of reasons to hate Barack Obama.
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:22.900]  I've got a lot of problems with him.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.260]  Was not a stupid person.
[01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:28.981]  Bill Clinton, obviously an evil, predatory man.
[01:10:29.602 --> 01:10:30.782]  Not unintelligent.
[01:10:31.702 --> 01:10:35.243]  History is riddled with bad men who are very bright.
[01:10:36.547 --> 01:10:45.852]  But now, recently, what we've seen from the leftists as their policies and philosophies and arguments have become increasingly irrational.
[01:10:45.972 --> 01:10:50.294]  This critical theory stuff, this leftist stuff, this trans stuff that doesn't make any sense.
[01:10:51.975 --> 01:10:57.498]  From a logical standpoint, the more irrational the leftist philosophy and agenda becomes,
[01:10:58.894 --> 01:11:02.577]  The dumber the leadership that espouses it becomes.
[01:11:03.378 --> 01:11:11.546]  So you have bright people on the left who are just remaining quiet, backing out, not making very many public appearances, reluctant to do endorsements.
[01:11:11.566 --> 01:11:16.230]  Or if they do endorsements, they're half-hearted via phone calls and they're just, you know, press releases.
[01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:18.953]  There's no joined appearances or anything like that.
[01:11:19.393 --> 01:11:24.438]  All of the bright people that were fighting against the interests of the American people on the left
[01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:26.225]  I don't know.
[01:11:40.112 --> 01:11:41.353]  Right about everything.
[01:11:41.373 --> 01:11:53.763]  Imagine, just hypothetically speaking, if Kamala Harris was Kamala Harris, except she was a right winger instead of a left winger, she would have no support among the Republican Party because it's just embarrassing how dumb she is all the time.
[01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:57.626]  You wouldn't see people on the right making her clips or comments go viral.
[01:11:58.527 --> 01:12:01.209]  You would see the left just criticizing her time and time again.
[01:12:01.249 --> 01:12:03.330]  The Krasisteins, the Sissons, these other influencers.
[01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:12.275]  They would be tearing her apart if she said right-wing things in the way that she says left-wing things because she is an absolute moron.
[01:12:12.295 --> 01:12:23.862]  I mean, here's her coming out in clip number four talking about how extremists across our nation want to turn back the clock and put us in worse times throughout our history.
[01:12:24.162 --> 01:12:24.722]  Clip number four.
[01:12:25.022 --> 01:12:27.384]  These extremists want to roll back the clock.
[01:12:29.079 --> 01:12:33.322]  To a time before women were treated as full citizens.
[01:12:34.202 --> 01:12:35.383]  Before women could vote.
[01:12:36.884 --> 01:12:39.125]  Before women could hold elected office.
[01:12:39.806 --> 01:12:42.327]  Before many women could even own property.
[01:12:42.788 --> 01:12:46.070]  These extremists are trying to take us backwards!
[01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:48.231]  But we're not having that!
[01:12:49.852 --> 01:12:51.393]  We're not having that!
[01:12:53.599 --> 01:12:54.219]  Unbelievable.
[01:12:54.559 --> 01:12:56.560]  And I'm going to run clip number 27 next.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:59.661]  This is Kamala Harris trying to explain what cloud storage is.
[01:12:59.821 --> 01:13:04.723]  And so just for the sake of the audience, if we have anybody out there who doesn't understand what cloud storage is.
[01:13:05.263 --> 01:13:08.904]  Traditionally speaking, we had offices that had real documents in filing cabinets.
[01:13:09.064 --> 01:13:10.425]  That's a local storage system.
[01:13:10.865 --> 01:13:15.447]  Then we had computers with hard drives, whether they were external hard drives or just the hard drives in our computers.
[01:13:15.887 --> 01:13:18.788]  That is where we would store our files on our computer, locally.
[01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:27.652]  Cloud storage is when you actually host and store those files in a server remotely that you access with the internet.
[01:13:28.153 --> 01:13:29.453]  That's all that cloud storage is.
[01:13:29.633 --> 01:13:48.003]  Access to your files, your information, your documents, even if they're not stored locally on your device, whether it's a laptop, a tablet, a phone, or a computer, whatever, you can still access them if they're saved in the cloud because there's server farms that can be accessed with the internet that host that data and present it to you when you call upon it.
[01:13:48.283 --> 01:13:49.664]  That's all cloud storage is.
[01:13:49.944 --> 01:13:52.185]  Here's Kamala Harris trying to explain this in clip number 27.
[01:13:52.225 --> 01:14:01.711]  So you're now no longer are you necessarily keeping those private files in some file cabinet that's locked in the basement of the house.
[01:14:02.931 --> 01:14:11.516]  It's on your laptop and it's then therefore up here in this cloud that exists above us, right?
[01:14:12.297 --> 01:14:13.958]  It's no longer in a physical place.
[01:14:15.538 --> 01:14:17.899]  We're gonna run clip number 46 next.
[01:14:18.159 --> 01:14:25.060]  Yet another example of Kamala Harris, her campaign, these leftists, trying to erase their history of failure.
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:40.924]  What was really interesting to me, and Owen pointed this out when I was on the air with him, after Joe Biden's monologue, his first broadcast to the American people and the world after he announced that he was withdrawing from the race.
[01:14:42.418 --> 01:14:47.420]  It was like a self-narrated autobiographical obituary, basically, is what it came off like.
[01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:55.344]  Even the pictures after the fact of Joe Biden with his family, Hunter and Ashley and others, it was like they were at his own funeral, even though he's still breathing.
[01:14:55.364 --> 01:14:56.725]  I guess he's dead, but he's breathing.
[01:14:57.305 --> 01:14:59.426]  But brain dead, so dead in spirit.
[01:15:00.947 --> 01:15:08.070]  But Joe Biden bragged during that monologue about his successes at the border.
[01:15:09.204 --> 01:15:09.944]  Obviously a lie.
[01:15:10.725 --> 01:15:34.154]  While simultaneously the Democrats have been pushing so hard to insist that Kamala Harris was never the borders are because they know that the border was a disaster and they know that associating Kamala with the border can only harm her because it's been the worst situation it's ever been in the history of this country at the southern border over the course of the last three or four years.
[01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:36.100]  Absolutely abysmal and everybody knows it.
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:53.067]  The left even admits implicitly that they know it by refusing to associate her with the border today, even though they made her the czar years ago, thinking that it was going to be good for her or that it was going to allow for success for her in the future after their policies were manifest and they were able to pass and solve the problem.
[01:15:53.087 --> 01:15:56.309]  They failed to solve the problem, whether intentionally or because of incompetence.
[01:15:56.669 --> 01:16:00.731]  Now they're throwing all of the onus of the responsibility of that
[01:16:00.871 --> 01:16:01.972]  We're good to go.
[01:16:14.286 --> 01:16:21.249]  So says, quote, every individual who is a resident of the United States is entitled to benefits for health care services under this act.
[01:16:21.629 --> 01:16:24.770]  Not every individual who's a citizen, but every individual who's a resident.
[01:16:25.291 --> 01:16:30.693]  So you support giving universal health care, Medicare for all, to people who are in this country illegally?
[01:16:31.373 --> 01:16:33.114]  Let me just be very clear about this.
[01:16:33.934 --> 01:16:41.998]  I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any human being from access to public safety,
[01:16:43.277 --> 01:16:45.799]  Public education or public health, period.
[01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:18.512]  More examples in viral clips, viral videos, and it's not cheap edits or cheap fakes like the leptist would say, or just cheap shots of her stupidity edited in a manipulative or misrepresentative way.
[01:17:19.533 --> 01:17:26.560]  They are just legitimate examples of her saying terrible things or totally stupid things by the hundreds.
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:27.441]  Let's see clip 50.
[01:17:28.257 --> 01:17:36.727]  And when we all sing happy tunes and sing Merry Christmas and wish each other Merry Christmas, these children are not going to have a Merry Christmas.
[01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:40.812]  How dare we speak Merry Christmas?
[01:17:41.473 --> 01:17:42.234]  How dare we?
[01:17:44.767 --> 01:17:55.914]  Unbelievable, even the guy behind her was kind of smirking if you could throw it up in b-roll, because he's like cringing that she's feigning such belligerence and recklessness and hatefulness and anger.
[01:17:55.974 --> 01:18:00.397]  He's cringing behind her as she says, how dare we say Merry Christmas?
[01:18:00.417 --> 01:18:01.758]  Look, he can't even wipe the smile off his face.
[01:18:01.798 --> 01:18:04.100]  He's just kind of wincing, like nodding his head.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.621]  You know, it's okay, you know.
[01:18:07.904 --> 01:18:13.469]  Not wanting at all to be associated with the comments that she's making and how small she looks as she feigns anger.
[01:18:13.489 --> 01:18:14.310]  The problem...
[01:18:15.965 --> 01:18:17.246]  Isn't that she's upset?
[01:18:18.106 --> 01:18:26.590]  She's not genuinely upset that people are celebrating and happy instead of solving these humanitarian crises that she claims to care so much about.
[01:18:26.890 --> 01:18:34.934]  She's actually just upset that people celebrate Christmas at all because she's a Satanist and an evil person and anybody who recognizes traditional Christian values is a threat to her political agenda.
[01:18:35.454 --> 01:18:36.755]  Let's see here in clip number 52.
[01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:38.816]  I think we have enough time before we go to break.
[01:18:39.216 --> 01:18:45.139]  Kamala Harris claiming that minorities and women cannot be successful in a capitalist society.
[01:18:45.299 --> 01:18:45.539]  Watch.
[01:18:46.178 --> 01:18:58.942]  Capitalism in its best form is about the beauty of competition to create the greatest product, to create the greatest outcome.
[01:18:59.842 --> 01:19:08.084]  But inherent in that is an assumption that everyone starts out on the same base and then they compete and whoever wins, wins.
[01:19:08.524 --> 01:19:09.745]  The market, right?
[01:19:09.945 --> 01:19:10.625]  The market share.
[01:19:11.785 --> 01:19:13.886]  But that's a false assumption.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:22.524]  When you take into account the fact that not everyone starts from the same place, in particular when we take into account race and gender.
[01:19:23.924 --> 01:19:37.111]  So what we have to do is recognize the disparities that have long existed and take that into consideration when we want to encourage competition.
[01:19:38.083 --> 01:19:40.984]  All right, folks, we're coming up on a break, and then we're going to get into more news on the other side.
[01:19:41.104 --> 01:19:42.985]  We're going to be together the next two and a half hours.
[01:19:43.025 --> 01:19:47.967]  So we're going to get all the Iran news, all the World War III news into all of the UK news as well.
[01:19:47.987 --> 01:19:51.608]  But in the meantime, please visit drjonesnaturals.com right now.

[01:20:11.058 --> 01:20:12.158]  I am Chase Geiser.

[01:20:19.702 --> 01:20:29.646]  We are going to dive in more on all of the breaking news and do some analysis, continued analysis, and wrap up our conversation a little bit about Kamala.
[01:20:31.769 --> 01:20:40.856]  But as I mentioned, there's been this honeymoon phase which is going to disappear and her lack of support is going to be reflected once again, I believe, in the polls.
[01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:44.598]  To the extent that the polls can be trusted at all or have any semblance of truth behind them.
[01:20:45.159 --> 01:20:45.739]  That is coming.
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:51.944]  Unless they can completely lie altogether and the polls aren't even conducted and they're just putting out numbers that help them, which is possible.
[01:20:51.984 --> 01:20:53.585]  It's probably true in some of these cases.
[01:20:55.182 --> 01:20:59.686]  But you can tell that she's not popular by all of the little clues everywhere.
[01:21:00.146 --> 01:21:10.995]  Not only just the fact that it's unbelievable to imagine that anybody would genuinely support her without being paid because of all the stupid things that she said and the fact that she just generally is stupid.
[01:21:11.615 --> 01:21:13.097]  But because of videos like this.
[01:21:13.157 --> 01:21:17.821]  We saw videos last week of rallies throughout the country that were poorly attended.
[01:21:17.861 --> 01:21:18.521]  This is clip number 13.
[01:21:20.936 --> 01:21:32.326]  And apparently it's representative Jasmine Crockett spotted outside of what looks like a Starbucks or a cafe, something like that, speaking to a crowd of people.
[01:21:32.766 --> 01:21:36.809]  And it's very obvious that virtually no one is there at all.
[01:21:37.290 --> 01:21:38.531]  Let's watch 13.
[01:21:44.496 --> 01:21:46.698]  Kind of seeing the reflections of like no one's there.
[01:21:46.718 --> 01:21:49.120]  I mean, I've seen more people stand around a street musician.
[01:21:49.889 --> 01:21:58.335]  Because if Project 2025 comes to pass, I really don't know where we will be, if we will be anywhere.
[01:21:58.875 --> 01:22:01.838]  If Trump is allowed to get any more Supreme Court justices,
[01:22:03.775 --> 01:22:06.216]  I'm trying to tell y'all ain't nobody safe.
[01:22:06.496 --> 01:22:08.977]  We have seen what this current Supreme Court has done.
[01:22:09.257 --> 01:22:12.398]  We absolutely plan to put two more on the Supreme Court.
[01:22:12.858 --> 01:22:17.920]  We cannot afford to go through another generation of this kind of hate.
[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:21.402]  We need court reform right now when it comes to the Supreme Court.
[01:22:23.262 --> 01:22:25.503]  So they got the Harris stuff plastered on the wall there.
[01:22:25.963 --> 01:22:31.145]  Based on the claps, it sounded like maybe there were a half a dozen people there, even though a representative showed up and spoke.
[01:22:32.746 --> 01:22:32.886]  And
[01:22:35.336 --> 01:22:45.649]  There's evidence coming out everywhere that her campaign is paying people to act like they support her, which I don't even know if that's legal.
[01:22:45.709 --> 01:22:46.190]  Maybe it is.
[01:22:46.230 --> 01:22:46.630]  Maybe it's not.
[01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:47.351]  Probably is.
[01:22:48.112 --> 01:22:53.899]  But we saw how quickly Harry Sisson flipped from Joe Biden is God to Kamala Harris is Queen.
[01:22:55.042 --> 01:23:02.524]  With the flick of a switch, instantly he just completely pivoted away from what he's been espousing as his ideal, brilliant candidate for so long.
[01:23:02.964 --> 01:23:12.086]  If he actually believed all the things that he was saying about Joe Biden over the course of the last 12 months, he would have been somebody who had been like, I am so disappointed that Joe Biden backed out and withdrew from this race.
[01:23:12.466 --> 01:23:13.186]  What happened?
[01:23:13.566 --> 01:23:14.526]  How was he forced out?
[01:23:14.586 --> 01:23:15.387]  Was he blackmailed?
[01:23:15.627 --> 01:23:18.747]  I've been saying for years, for months at least, that he should be the candidate.
[01:23:18.767 --> 01:23:21.168]  I've been espousing all that's so brilliant about his leadership.
[01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:26.679]  He wouldn't just immediately flip the switch and say, all right, Kamala, unless he was paid, right?
[01:23:28.539 --> 01:23:29.780]  Obviously paid.
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:31.541]  And I'm gonna show you this clip 31 here.
[01:23:31.561 --> 01:23:32.201]  This is Aiden Ross.
[01:23:32.241 --> 01:23:37.023]  Aiden Ross is the number one kick streamer, famous for his association with the Tate Brothers.
[01:23:37.443 --> 01:23:38.324]  Very funny guy.
[01:23:38.344 --> 01:23:40.044]  I really like Aiden.
[01:23:40.785 --> 01:23:45.847]  And this is him talking about how he's disappointed that so many rappers have accepted
[01:23:46.547 --> 01:23:46.907]  I don't know.
[01:24:07.893 --> 01:24:10.514]  For whatever speech the politician was going to give, right?
[01:24:10.914 --> 01:24:16.476]  They pay people to get the crowds to show up because the crowds will not show up if it's just them.
[01:24:17.176 --> 01:24:24.019]  They have to have a celebrity or some sort of entertainment or a Hollywood partnership or a music business partnership in order to get anybody to show up to their events.
[01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:27.220]  It's not like Trump who says, I'm going to be here and everybody goes to see Trump.
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:29.481]  Because Trump is actually the celebrity.
[01:24:29.701 --> 01:24:35.583]  They have to outsource the celebrity status of others in order to get the same level of support.
[01:24:36.747 --> 01:24:39.089]  So much love and respect for Quavo as an artist.
[01:24:39.549 --> 01:24:41.071]  I really wish I didn't see what Quavo did.
[01:24:41.411 --> 01:24:44.033]  You know, Kamala Harris is DMing rappers.
[01:24:44.133 --> 01:24:44.894]  She DMed Snout.
[01:24:44.914 --> 01:24:47.416]  Snout posted on Twitter, which I respect Snout for doing.
[01:24:47.656 --> 01:24:50.098]  She's trying to endorse rappers to come and do it.
[01:24:50.378 --> 01:24:55.042]  Megan Thee Stallion and Quavo, they probably took a bag to go to the conference and stuff.
[01:24:55.142 --> 01:24:56.083]  It's sad, bro.
[01:24:56.123 --> 01:24:56.843]  It's really, really sad.
[01:24:57.244 --> 01:24:58.705]  You know, I wish they didn't do that.
[01:24:59.345 --> 01:25:00.407]  But that's why it's free Tory.
[01:25:01.288 --> 01:25:02.650]  And again, guys, it is what it is.
[01:25:02.910 --> 01:25:03.451]  It is what it is.
[01:25:04.352 --> 01:25:07.036]  And again, if Trump were to do that, have Megan Thee Stallion twerk.
[01:25:07.476 --> 01:25:14.085]  And of course, the main issue here is that for the second time, at least the second time,
[01:25:15.086 --> 01:25:22.127]  In a major way, the Democratic Party has officially, formally betrayed its own voters.
[01:25:22.427 --> 01:25:36.310]  So we talk all day about how the Democrats are constantly betraying America and lying about Republicans and the American people and exploiting us and taking advantage of us and failing to represent our interests because globalist interests are more beneficial to their political status and agenda.
[01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:40.611]  We can talk all day about Democrats failing to do anything for us.
[01:25:43.527 --> 01:25:50.069]  But they've repeatedly, totally disregarded the wants, needs, and interests of their own voters.
[01:25:50.769 --> 01:25:54.751]  And not just by failing on a policy level, but literally in the campaigns.
[01:25:54.791 --> 01:26:03.634]  I mean, do you remember in 2016 what happened between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and how disappointed all of the Bernie supporters were?
[01:26:04.654 --> 01:26:25.077]  That Bernie, after it was stolen from him because of the way they conducted the primaries and had vocal votes that weren't really tallied accurately, after they stole the primary away from Bernie, Bernie came out and endorsed Hillary Clinton, and all of the Bernie bros were so disappointed that he did that, that he didn't fight harder, and because of their bitterness that this election was stolen from them,
[01:26:26.653 --> 01:26:45.080]  Because they were so disappointed that their own primary was stolen from them by Hillary Clinton, many of the Bernie supporters, despite the fact he's a socialist and all of his policies are virtually the opposite of Trump, decided to vote for Trump because they voted for Bernie, he was perceived, even though erroneously, as an outsider, and the only other outsider alternative
[01:26:46.212 --> 01:26:49.274]  Was Donald Trump, and he won in 2016 because of this.
[01:26:49.534 --> 01:27:06.045]  But then again, having learned nothing apparently from the disaster that was the 2016 presidential campaign for the Democrats, having learned nothing regarding what happens when you betray your own party and voters and supporters that way, they've done the same exact thing again.
[01:27:06.065 --> 01:27:07.406]  We're going to show clip number 32.
[01:27:08.086 --> 01:27:09.627]  They've done the same exact thing again, where
[01:27:10.948 --> 01:27:15.890]  They are putting up a candidate that literally no one voted for in the primary.
[01:27:15.970 --> 01:27:18.231]  Yes, technically she was on the Joe Biden ticket.
[01:27:18.571 --> 01:27:19.251]  Technically.
[01:27:19.951 --> 01:27:22.572]  But they didn't vote for her to be the presidential candidate.
[01:27:22.592 --> 01:27:24.653]  They voted for her to be the vice presidential candidate.
[01:27:25.053 --> 01:27:26.474]  And now she's going to have the delegates.
[01:27:26.794 --> 01:27:28.374]  Now she's likely to be the candidate.
[01:27:29.475 --> 01:27:35.357]  And it's the second time, at least the second time, that the Democratic Party has insisted on a candidate that did not actually win the primary.
[01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:37.398]  When they do this, they lose.
[01:27:37.458 --> 01:27:37.778]  Clip number 32.
[01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:40.908]  The super chat says that Roseanne won the bet.
[01:27:42.069 --> 01:27:44.310]  So the bet was between Michael Malice and Roseanne.
[01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:45.991]  Roseanne said there won't be an election.
[01:27:46.191 --> 01:27:47.832]  And Michael said, oh, please, yes, there will.
[01:27:48.533 --> 01:27:55.537]  And Michael later clarified that he meant quite literally, whether it's a a fake election, there will be some type of election.
[01:27:56.317 --> 01:28:00.360]  And I think Roseanne was saying it would just like there would not be a legitimate election.
[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:01.881]  This is not an illegitimate election.
[01:28:02.665 --> 01:28:07.250]  Yeah, and so the question then is, I think Michael Maus is going to stand on... No, no, no, no.
[01:28:07.330 --> 01:28:08.451]  There's two candidates and you're going to vote.
[01:28:08.471 --> 01:28:09.152]  This is an election.
[01:28:09.432 --> 01:28:10.994]  Just because it's rigged doesn't mean there's no election.
[01:28:11.414 --> 01:28:15.639]  But I do kind of think that that's not the spirit of what Roseanne's trying to argue.
[01:28:15.659 --> 01:28:21.145]  An installed person that no one voted for as the nominee is not an election.
[01:28:22.426 --> 01:28:23.667]  They're forcing you to vote for her.
[01:28:23.687 --> 01:28:24.607]  A bunch of coerced delegates.
[01:28:24.747 --> 01:28:30.990]  So all these people in all these states, 14 million people, voted for Joe Biden in their primaries, right?
[01:28:31.130 --> 01:28:34.372]  I disagree with their vote, but they voted for Joe Biden in their primaries.
[01:28:34.832 --> 01:28:41.575]  Those delegates who take those votes and then go to the DNC and nominate Joe Biden, that's their job.
[01:28:41.975 --> 01:28:46.077]  They have now betrayed every single person who voted for Joe Biden.
[01:28:46.638 --> 01:28:56.862]  Now it was leaked this week that Kamala's campaign has likely chosen, though it's not been confirmed, likely chosen Josh Shapiro to be the vice presidential candidate.
[01:28:56.882 --> 01:29:00.204]  We've covered his speeches, his rhetoric, his tone.
[01:29:00.444 --> 01:29:08.487]  He's obviously studied Barack Obama very intently and is copying, mimicking that style because of its success in politics for eight years.
[01:29:12.705 --> 01:29:18.470]  He's got quite an interesting history of doing things like supporting Drag Queen Story Hours.
[01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:20.891]  He's absolutely a leftist.
[01:29:21.071 --> 01:29:23.133]  He lies incessantly about JD Vance.
[01:29:23.613 --> 01:29:30.319]  He's not to be trusted, but this is this vice presidential pick situation for both candidates.
[01:29:31.119 --> 01:29:34.361]  Is really about winning over these swing states, these Rust Belt states.
[01:29:34.381 --> 01:29:36.103]  So JD Vance was a great pick for that.
[01:29:36.803 --> 01:29:39.785]  And Shapiro, of course, is a reasonable pick for this too.
[01:29:39.825 --> 01:29:46.570]  But the problem that the Harris campaign has is there are a lot of people within the Democratic Party that really do not like Jews.
[01:29:47.423 --> 01:29:49.264]  Because of the whole free Palestine push.
[01:29:49.284 --> 01:29:52.326]  It went viral on TikTok and Instagram for months and months and months.
[01:29:52.366 --> 01:29:55.207]  All of the bombings that were happening in the Gaza Strip.
[01:29:55.247 --> 01:29:56.988]  All the innocent people who have died.
[01:29:57.068 --> 01:29:59.270]  All of the babies and children being pulled out of rubble.
[01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:02.051]  And I know that both sides lie about what the other side does.
[01:30:02.091 --> 01:30:04.352]  And some things have been debunked and proven false.
[01:30:04.392 --> 01:30:08.655]  But there's no doubt that thousands upon thousands of civilians have died.
[01:30:09.895 --> 01:30:21.265]  Because of the bombings in the Gaza Strip and as a result of that and their viral nature on TikTok and other platforms, the young generation of this country is very much opposed to Israel.
[01:30:21.305 --> 01:30:25.509]  Whether correct or not, they have seen the injustice
[01:30:26.109 --> 01:30:26.429]  I don't know.
[01:30:51.024 --> 01:30:51.204]  Yeah.
[01:31:02.492 --> 01:31:06.673]  A second guessing of the decision within the campaign to have Shapiro as a running mate.
[01:31:07.133 --> 01:31:20.358]  We saw that an ad came out, apparently it was leaked, that basically said that that Shapiro was the VP pick to try to push and force the hand of her not to back out of having him as the VP candidate.
[01:31:20.378 --> 01:31:22.218]  So we're seeing clips of him go viral now.
[01:31:22.298 --> 01:31:29.780]  Obviously he's an articulate, smart person, apparently evil and dishonest, as one might imagine of any political leftist running for the vice president of the United States.
[01:31:30.061 --> 01:31:30.941]  But here in clip number
[01:31:32.101 --> 01:31:36.566]  33.
[01:31:32.141 --> 01:31:36.566]  This is a video that was shared, I believe, by Pasobic on Axe.
[01:31:36.926 --> 01:31:38.768]  It's about three and a half minutes long, but I want you to watch this.
[01:31:38.908 --> 01:31:42.432]  Share this information about Josh Shapiro with anyone you can.
[01:31:42.472 --> 01:31:43.132]  This is clip number 33.
[01:31:44.295 --> 01:31:46.616]  Greenberg will now go to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
[01:31:46.776 --> 01:31:53.057]  The 28-year-old teacher was found dead inside her Maniunk apartment with 20 stab wounds in 2011.
[01:31:53.677 --> 01:31:57.578]  Her death was ruled a suicide, but her parents believe she was murdered.
[01:31:57.678 --> 01:32:11.341]  The AG's office, led by Josh Shapiro, has long insisted evidence proves the 27-year-old died by suicide, but the Greenbergs are convinced she was murdered, and they're currently suing the city's medical examiner with the hope of reopening the case.
[01:32:12.642 --> 01:32:17.245]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard today's edition of Human Events Daily, here live, Butler, Pennsylvania.
[01:32:17.765 --> 01:32:28.952]  Today is August 2nd, 2024, and oh, Dominique, folks, the receipts hole on Josh Shapiro keeps getting deeper and deeper and deeper.
[01:32:29.192 --> 01:32:35.757]  Yesterday, we covered a little bit, we'll get into more of it today, the case of Ellen Greenberg.
[01:32:36.657 --> 01:32:40.499]  The horrific, stabbing death that she received in 2011
[01:32:42.455 --> 01:33:00.987]  Just outside Manningham, Pennsylvania, which is in the Philadelphia area, East Falls, where she was found stabbed 10 times in the front, 10 times in the back, including the back of her head, including her spinal column, twice, according to testimony from medical examiners, post-mortem.
[01:33:01.667 --> 01:33:04.389]  And yet Josh Shapiro signed off on this being a suicide.
[01:33:05.049 --> 01:33:05.910]  And why would he do that?
[01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:10.533]  Does it have to do with potential connections that her fiancé,
[01:33:11.775 --> 01:33:12.735]  I don't
[01:33:31.252 --> 01:33:35.133]  To just get some semblance of an investigation going.
[01:33:35.613 --> 01:33:44.535]  And yet, when you go to Josh Shapiro's office, when he was the Attorney General, Josh Shapiro would just tell you, oh no, no no, just a suicide, there's nothing to see here.
[01:33:44.755 --> 01:33:49.216]  Seems like there's a lot to see here, but Josh Shapiro doesn't want you to see that.
[01:33:49.636 --> 01:33:58.278]  The same same way that he doesn't want you to know about the sexual harassment going on in his own office that was perpetuated by one of his
[01:33:58.618 --> 01:34:02.001]  Cabinet members, a guy by the name of Mike Vareb.
[01:34:02.381 --> 01:34:09.626]  Mike Vareb, a former Republican who decided to become a traitor and go and work for a Democrat governor.
[01:34:09.706 --> 01:34:19.073]  The same Mike Vareb from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania that I used to see walking around blitzed drunk out of his mind in Walmart.
[01:34:19.333 --> 01:34:21.175]  Yes, that is the same Mike Vareb.
[01:34:21.195 --> 01:34:25.198]  So it doesn't surprise me at all that this absolute lush,
[01:34:25.598 --> 01:34:50.315]  Would take the same philandering behavior to the State House, to the Cabinet, when he decided to throw in with Josh Shapiro, stab his own party in the back, and then decide to go and commit sexual harassment, the same way that he doesn't seem to have any loyalty to his own party, to his own ideals, or really anyone but himself.
[01:34:50.695 --> 01:34:51.395]  What can I say?
[01:34:51.776 --> 01:34:55.198]  Couldn't happen to a better couple of guys, but very interestingly,
[01:34:56.179 --> 01:35:05.949]  Josh Shapiro, we're told, didn't even want to stand up for something like this, paid the hush money, tried to go after the victim in this case.
[01:35:06.309 --> 01:35:10.294]  Why does Josh Shapiro not care about female victims?
[01:35:10.614 --> 01:35:16.060]  Whether it's the victim of 20 stab wounds in the front or the back,
[01:35:16.596 --> 01:35:17.997]  Shapiro is obviously a bad person.
[01:35:18.417 --> 01:35:21.758]  He's got a history of lies and dishonesty and cover-ups.
[01:35:21.798 --> 01:35:23.959]  And this is really to be expected from the leftists.
[01:35:24.019 --> 01:35:25.199]  I mean, remember what
[01:35:44.966 --> 01:35:52.648]  The Clintons have done, and the Democratic machine has done, to innocent person after innocent person over the years, and gotten away with.
[01:35:52.668 --> 01:36:05.412]  And I'm specifically talking about people that are associated with the Clintons, like chefs that are found drowned, and then people that are associated with the Obamas, like chefs that are found drowned.
[01:36:05.912 --> 01:36:13.074]  People found hanging from trees with shotgun wounds on their body, ruled suicides.
[01:36:13.934 --> 01:36:25.117]  Seth Rich determined to have been the victim of a botched robbery, murdered, despite the fact that nothing was taken from his body when that happened.
[01:36:25.137 --> 01:36:40.382]  And it was all while apparently Seth Rich was giving information to WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign, even suing investigators and journalists like the brave Matt Couch simply for looking into it to the point where he's bankrupted.
[01:36:41.451 --> 01:36:42.552]  Rendered broke as a result
[01:37:02.259 --> 01:37:06.883]  With the help of the Secret Service and the CIA, presidents like Donald Trump.
[01:37:07.523 --> 01:37:10.365]  And here we have Shapiro lying about J.D.
[01:37:10.405 --> 01:37:15.509]  Vance, very quickly diverting, and you can tell just by his rhetoric, by the way he speaks, he sounds like Barack Obama.
[01:37:15.549 --> 01:37:20.913]  Clip number 40 here, this is Shapiro quickly pivoting and lying about J.D.
[01:37:20.953 --> 01:37:21.194]  Vance.
[01:37:22.354 --> 01:37:23.275]  Governor, J.D.
[01:37:23.375 --> 01:37:29.420]  Vance just said this about you, and these are his words, quote, he compared you to a really bad impression of Barack Obama.
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:30.260]  What is your response to that?
[01:37:31.567 --> 01:37:32.147]  Is that what he said?
[01:37:32.167 --> 01:37:34.008]  That's great.
[01:37:34.188 --> 01:37:36.168]  I love how we get the real-time quotes here.
[01:37:36.248 --> 01:37:38.589]  I mean, look, I don't know.
[01:37:38.609 --> 01:37:46.312]  Barack Obama was probably our most gifted orator of my time, so it's kind of a weird insult, I guess.
[01:37:46.412 --> 01:37:50.913]  But, look, I'll say this about J.D.
[01:37:50.993 --> 01:37:51.293]  Vance.
[01:37:52.093 --> 01:37:56.855]  It is real hard being honest with the American people when you're not being honest with yourself.
[01:37:57.867 --> 01:37:58.348]  J.D.
[01:37:58.448 --> 01:38:02.512]  Vance is a total phony baloney.
[01:38:02.992 --> 01:38:08.618]  He is the most inorganic candidate I think I have ever seen.
[01:38:08.698 --> 01:38:09.599]  Are you kidding me?
[01:38:09.659 --> 01:38:11.581]  They appointed Kamala with zero votes.
[01:38:11.621 --> 01:38:12.883]  That's the definition of inorganic.
[01:38:14.172 --> 01:38:21.416]  It is impossible for him to articulate a coherent message to the American people, because he doesn't believe it.
[01:38:21.796 --> 01:38:24.758]  This guy is not exactly off to a good start.
[01:38:25.258 --> 01:38:30.261]  And it is clear that Donald Trump really has buyer's remorse with his pick.
[01:38:30.641 --> 01:38:35.984]  So if he wants to sling insults in my direction, which I'm not even sure is an insult, let him do it.
[01:38:36.124 --> 01:38:36.644]  That's fine.
[01:38:36.704 --> 01:38:37.244]  Bring it on.
[01:38:37.344 --> 01:38:39.085]  I'll be ready for whatever the hell J.D.
[01:38:39.145 --> 01:38:40.186]  Vance throws in my direction.
[01:38:41.419 --> 01:38:41.820]  Thanks everybody.
[01:38:56.164 --> 01:38:56.905]  We're good to go.
[01:39:16.025 --> 01:39:26.095]  ...had been focus grouped, and it was being pushed by opponents of Donald Trump on every platform, whether it was mainstream media outlets, social media influencers, political campaigns, candidate offices.
[01:39:26.636 --> 01:39:31.721]  They wanted to brand Trump as the chaos candidate, and now we're seeing the same technique being applied to J.D.
[01:39:31.761 --> 01:39:39.629]  Vance from these leftists who have attempted to seize a monopoly of all political narrative in the country, almost successfully with the exception of X and some others.
[01:39:40.811 --> 01:39:49.357]  Some independent outlets like Joe Rogan and Infowars, they're using the same technique to try to brand J.D.
[01:39:49.397 --> 01:39:51.919]  Vance as weird, but he's really not weird.
[01:39:52.039 --> 01:39:52.979]  Maybe he's CIA.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.641]  Maybe he's a phony baloney.
[01:39:54.901 --> 01:39:56.202]  Maybe he's Deep State.
[01:39:56.282 --> 01:39:56.582]  I don't know.
[01:39:56.662 --> 01:39:57.603]  I'm giving him a chance.
[01:39:57.643 --> 01:39:59.404]  As I said before on air, I'm going to give Vance a chance.
[01:40:00.612 --> 01:40:03.173]  But he's not a weird person.
[01:40:03.533 --> 01:40:12.335]  Remember when they came out this week and they had this fake article saying that in his book he described making love to a couch and it just simply wasn't true?
[01:40:12.535 --> 01:40:14.475]  Nothing like that in the book whatsoever.
[01:40:14.815 --> 01:40:19.156]  Then they did a retraction saying, oh it was just a joke, it was satire, but it was too late by then.
[01:40:19.356 --> 01:40:21.817]  They're trying to make him weird so they plant a fake story.
[01:40:22.797 --> 01:40:23.878]  It's a psychological operation.
[01:40:23.898 --> 01:40:24.479]  It's very unethical.
[01:40:24.599 --> 01:40:27.781]  It's lying to say the least if not manipulative at the worst levels.
[01:40:27.801 --> 01:40:28.382]  And it's just simply
[01:40:51.570 --> 01:40:54.293]  A psychological operation that's not true.
[01:40:54.313 --> 01:41:01.723]  I want to run clip number 47 here of J.D.
[01:41:01.763 --> 01:41:05.147]  Vance in a recent podcast appearance responding to some of these allegations.
[01:41:06.601 --> 01:41:10.783]  I have a question about just, just obviously, you know, running and being in politics.
[01:41:10.943 --> 01:41:13.604]  Do you take what sometimes the media says about you personally?
[01:41:13.624 --> 01:41:14.724]  Like, I don't know if you saw that.
[01:41:15.224 --> 01:41:18.386]  There was like a whole clip of like people calling you weird.
[01:41:19.226 --> 01:41:19.806]  Did you see that?
[01:41:21.667 --> 01:41:24.388]  I certainly know the Kamala campaign wants to call me weird.
[01:41:24.588 --> 01:41:30.690]  Yeah, but I'm wondering why that word and because like it was on like a, it was like clipped on like a thousand different media outlets.
[01:41:30.730 --> 01:41:32.391]  Like they were all using the same word.
[01:41:32.771 --> 01:41:37.332]  Yeah, I mean, I don't know if it's, like, something they focus grouped and decided to push on us.
[01:41:37.352 --> 01:41:39.073]  I mean, like, I'm a pretty normal guy.
[01:41:39.113 --> 01:41:42.254]  I've got a wife and kids, and I like to hang out and, you know, watch football.
[01:41:42.894 --> 01:41:43.854]  He's obviously a normal guy.
[01:41:43.874 --> 01:41:46.635]  And if you guys haven't watched Hillbilly Elegy yet, it's on Netflix.
[01:41:46.655 --> 01:41:47.455]  I recommend watching it.
[01:41:47.475 --> 01:41:52.836]  It's not the best movie ever, but it will inform you and give you some context around JD Vance so you know who he is.
[01:41:53.457 --> 01:41:54.117]  But here in clip number 34,
[01:41:56.144 --> 01:41:56.304]  J.D.
[01:41:56.364 --> 01:42:01.248]  Vance gets into it as to what's actually weird, and he's absolutely right.
[01:42:01.268 --> 01:42:01.768]  Let's watch.
[01:42:02.209 --> 01:42:02.569]  It's funny.
[01:42:02.589 --> 01:42:07.232]  It's like the people who call me weird want to give like hormone therapies and sterilize nine-year-olds.
[01:42:07.252 --> 01:42:12.296]  I think it's a lot weirder, you know, me just like living a normal life with my kids and my wife.
[01:42:12.356 --> 01:42:17.880]  But this is what they do, I think, is they latch onto a message and they try to sell it even if it's fake.
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:21.663]  And I think, you know, again, to go back to something Trump said,
[01:42:22.913 --> 01:42:28.676]  We were talking about Trump earlier is Trump's superpower in politics is he just doesn't give a shit, right?
[01:42:28.716 --> 01:42:30.117]  He doesn't care what they say about him.
[01:42:30.177 --> 01:42:31.217]  He's going to be himself.
[01:42:31.437 --> 01:42:32.358]  He's going to tell jokes.
[01:42:32.938 --> 01:42:36.220]  He's going to say things that drive some people off the wall.
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:37.520]  But then we actually listen to what he said.
[01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:38.861]  He's like, oh, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[01:42:39.982 --> 01:42:45.384]  I think that you just if you're going to be in politics and social media age, you've got to kind of have a thick skin and just do what you need to do.
[01:42:46.465 --> 01:42:48.326]  All right, folks, we're going to get more news on the other side.
[01:42:48.346 --> 01:42:50.267]  We're coming up on a break here in 90 seconds.
[01:42:51.087 --> 01:42:57.808]  We're going to dive into some of these other political ads that have come out a little bit from Trump, a little bit about the updates to the economy.
[01:42:57.848 --> 01:43:00.129]  We had record crashes in the stock market this week.
[01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:11.111]  I believe it dropped 5% in 24 hours, which is the first time that that has happened, as I understand it, since March of 2020, when the lockdowns were declared in response to the pandemic.
[01:43:11.931 --> 01:43:15.892]  And we've seen that the unemployment rate actually rose a little bit.
[01:43:16.132 --> 01:43:18.433]  Employment dipped unexpectedly.
[01:43:19.153 --> 01:43:19.794]  We're good to go.
[01:43:29.767 --> 01:43:34.110]  Or pull up your phone, whatever, go to InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:43:34.130 --> 01:43:42.215]  And if you go to InfoWarsStore.com right now, there is a menu at the top and you can pull up InfoWars MD from the dropdown menu.
[01:43:42.255 --> 01:43:45.937]  Now, if you select InfoWars MD, these products are amazing.
[01:43:46.237 --> 01:43:55.803]  They are, some of them, the same exact products that we've sold before, but this partnership is imperative in order for us to keep InfoWars on the air because we cannot run out of stock
[01:43:56.283 --> 01:44:00.266]  When you buy the InfoWars MD line at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:00.286 --> 01:44:06.630]  So check out Joint Relief Max, the Turmeric 95, Nitric Boost, all of our amazing products.
[01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:09.932]  Same power that we've always had at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:10.252 --> 01:44:19.118]  But this is the line to get to keep us on the air while our species itself is under relentless attack from a global elite satanic force.
[01:44:19.178 --> 01:44:19.558]  Stay with us.
[01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:27.144]  This is a make it or break it moment, so I need people to connect those synapses in their brain for you to make a decision.
[01:44:28.305 --> 01:44:31.427]  If you don't support InfoWars, we will be shut down.
[01:44:31.447 --> 01:44:34.250]  And people say, well, they're constantly trying to shut you down.
[01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:35.050]  How are you still on the air?
[01:44:35.190 --> 01:44:35.470]  God.
[01:44:36.511 --> 01:44:37.572]  But God works through people.
[01:44:39.093 --> 01:44:44.417]  So, we're in a paradox here where the judge says we're open for three more months.
[01:44:46.119 --> 01:44:50.562]  If we're able to get a buyer out of the law, they won't be able to shut us down.
[01:44:50.582 --> 01:44:51.483]  I'll just work with somebody else.
[01:44:52.406 --> 01:44:52.906]  And that's coming.
[01:44:52.926 --> 01:44:53.627]  That's got to be set up.
[01:44:54.808 --> 01:45:03.995]  But in the meantime, if people believe the news that we're being shut down everywhere, which they tried to do and failed, by that foregone conclusion, we're shut down.
[01:45:04.135 --> 01:45:15.484]  And under the last federal bankruptcy manager who would not reorder product and killed all our advertising, who was positioning us to be shut down and tried to shut us down, we caught him.
[01:45:15.725 --> 01:45:16.765]  The judge caught him and fired him.
[01:45:18.267 --> 01:45:19.708]  We're almost sold out of all the products.
[01:45:20.543 --> 01:45:20.783]  All right?
[01:45:21.584 --> 01:45:24.325]  But we have a lot of great products that are still in stock.
[01:45:24.825 --> 01:45:25.566]  Limited supply.
[01:45:25.626 --> 01:45:28.867]  So I need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:45:29.107 --> 01:45:30.148]  And we just had a donation button.
[01:45:30.168 --> 01:45:30.948]  Maybe we should just do that.
[01:45:31.689 --> 01:45:34.450]  You're fighting for freedom in a key election, battling the globalists.
[01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:35.110]  We need support.
[01:45:35.851 --> 01:45:37.412]  But we want a long-term relationship with you.
[01:45:37.432 --> 01:45:39.393]  We want you to be symbiotic.

[01:45:46.936 --> 01:45:47.857]  We want a relationship.
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:54.557]  So, there's the Infowars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[01:45:55.307 --> 01:46:02.673]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's salt palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[01:46:03.114 --> 01:46:07.017]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[01:46:07.077 --> 01:46:08.338]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[01:46:08.358 --> 01:46:19.708]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWarsMD.

[01:46:56.295 --> 01:46:56.996]  Already mentioned that.
