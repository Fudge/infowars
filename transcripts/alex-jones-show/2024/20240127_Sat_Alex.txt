[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000]  I'm watching the midterms.
[00:00:22.436 --> 00:00:25.819]  Man, you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:00:26.299 --> 00:00:30.002]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:35.846]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:00:37.327 --> 00:00:46.654]  You want a drop?
[00:00:46.794 --> 00:00:47.934]  You want a drop?
[00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:49.095]  Yeah!
[00:00:49.275 --> 00:00:49.956]  You're the president.
[00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:56.705]  [cheering]
[00:00:56.705 --> 00:01:15.626]   And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[00:01:15.626 --> 00:01:18.966]  [music playing]
[00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:22.205]  [explosion]
[00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:25.445]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:01:25.445 --> 00:01:25.945]  Now.
[00:01:26.603 --> 00:01:26.843]  No.
[00:01:27.424 --> 00:01:28.944]  I'm glad you asked me that question.
[00:01:29.524 --> 00:01:32.545]  No, I'm not having any second thoughts about representing President Trump.
[00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:34.826]  It is the proudest thing I could ever do.
[00:01:35.506 --> 00:01:41.068]  What I am having second thoughts about is the license that I stand here with that the people in there are supposed to have.
[00:01:42.628 --> 00:01:46.628]  I have not spoken because I respect my ethics.
[00:01:46.628 --> 00:01:48.628]  Well, I'm not trying to.
[00:01:48.628 --> 00:01:58.628]  [Music]
[00:01:58.628 --> 00:02:00.628]  We are live.
[00:02:00.984 --> 00:02:02.044]  Saturday, January 27, 2024.
[00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:06.208]  It is 12.01 and 52 seconds.
[00:02:06.748 --> 00:02:15.555]  This is a commercial-free emergency transmission going out on satellites, AM and FM stations, the mighty X-Platform at Real Alex Jones.
[00:02:16.215 --> 00:02:21.081]  And more, and this is listener and viewer participation to get past the censors and the AI.
[00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:33.457]  Please take the links from Real Alex Jones and InfoWars.com forward slash show and the front page of InfoWars.com and give it to your email list, your text messages, your neighbors, your friends, your family, because this is a participation sport.
[00:02:34.963 --> 00:02:37.984]  Texas has had a giant win, 25 states joining it.
[00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:40.844]  Massive attention to the collapsed border.
[00:02:41.444 --> 00:02:43.025]  This is amazing what's happening.
[00:02:43.045 --> 00:02:48.146]  We're going to be covering that coming up in 30 minutes with Michael Yohn, who is in Central America.
[00:02:48.186 --> 00:02:50.526]  We've also got reporters on the ground at the border.
[00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:53.087]  We're going to the border coming up this week.
[00:02:53.147 --> 00:02:59.688]  We will be there reporting live just incredible things that are unfolding all around us.
[00:03:00.068 --> 00:03:04.169]  Texas responds to Biden demands for border access with demands of its own.
[00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:09.793]  Governor Abbott tells Tucker Carlson yesterday he's prepared for conflict with the Feds.
[00:03:10.213 --> 00:03:16.137]  Biden issues an ultimatum, promises to shut down border if lawmakers pass budget deal to fund Ukraine and Israel.
[00:03:16.518 --> 00:03:19.100]  But he means then legalize all the illegals that come across.
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.180]  That's all he's really talking about.
[00:03:20.661 --> 00:03:21.942]  And so much more.
[00:03:22.342 --> 00:03:24.083]  The Washington Post promoting Sybil.
[00:03:25.484 --> 00:03:26.825]  War and so much more.
[00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:32.550]  But if you're just tuned in and you're saying, what in the world is sitting on your desk?
[00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:38.493]  Well, both of these things belong to my dad, who's a doctor, and he got this skull.
[00:03:38.513 --> 00:03:39.814]  It's a real skull from India.
[00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:44.558]  Back then in medical school, they had you buy one for anatomy, dentist, oral surgeon.
[00:03:44.578 --> 00:03:47.981]  So since I was a little kid, he had that skull even before I was born.
[00:03:48.922 --> 00:03:51.764]  And then you've got another thing that belongs to my dad that I asked to borrow.
[00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:56.969]  This is a 35 million year old crocodile, saltwater crocodile skull.
[00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.653]  They dug out a sandstone in the Sahara about 20 years ago.
[00:04:02.273 --> 00:04:04.233]  Hard to believe an awesome fossil like that.
[00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:08.334]  I think my dad paid $500 for it in a trip to the Middle East.
[00:04:09.294 --> 00:04:13.555]  I've seen some people see it, because I've had it here at the office, and they go, well, I'll offer you $10,000 for it right now.
[00:04:13.595 --> 00:04:14.255]  Well, it's not mine.
[00:04:14.735 --> 00:04:16.115]  Why do I have these on the desk?
[00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:19.516]  Because species come and go.
[00:04:19.636 --> 00:04:21.056]  Civilizations come and go.
[00:04:22.477 --> 00:04:23.657]  Dynasties come and go.
[00:04:24.037 --> 00:04:30.158]  And I don't want to see humans be a fossil that some future species or maybe aliens dig up.
[00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:32.622]  I don't want us to just be a memory.
[00:04:32.682 --> 00:04:37.166]  I want our species to go type one civilization, off world, what Elon Musk is talking about.
[00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:41.449]  So I don't want to end up like this extinct species of saltwater crocodile.
[00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.513]  That is the goal and that is what Team Humanity is really all about.
[00:04:46.533 --> 00:04:49.615]  So I thought this would be an interesting illustration after Viva!
[00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:56.623]  Fry, great lawyer, great talk show host, breaks down what's happening with Trump and why it's so dangerous for people not just here but around the world.
[00:04:56.643 --> 00:05:00.687]  Then we're going to have Michael Yaun on to do the deep dive on Eagle Pass and more.
[00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:04.572]  And our crew's getting ready to either leave Monday or Tuesday to go down there.
[00:05:04.612 --> 00:05:06.594]  We've got a lot of sources, a lot of breaking news.
[00:05:07.134 --> 00:05:10.138]  The Fed's promised to move in against the Texas Guard yesterday.
[00:05:12.898 --> 00:05:15.078]  The Texas Governor Abbott said, go ahead and do it.
[00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:17.119]  Nothing's happened so far.
[00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:19.819]  The convoy gets there in a few days, one of many.
[00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:26.120]  We are going to be there live on the ground with our reporters, breaking it all down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:43.963]   Also, coming up, if you're watching or listening on Spaces on X, in the second hour, and I'll probably go longer, we are going to do something that nobody else is doing on a multimedia platform that's on AM, FM, Stations, radio, TV, cable stations.
[00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:52.708]  We are now successfully been doing this on the American Journal with Harrison Smith, working with the great Chase Geyser.
[00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:55.670]  They've been doing Spaces now a few times last week.
[00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.313]  So this is my first Spaces simulcasting InfoWars right now.
[00:06:01.373 --> 00:06:03.194]  So great job of the crew getting that all hooked up.
[00:06:03.234 --> 00:06:07.117]  There are usually a few little glitches here and there, but we're getting this all ironed out.
[00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:18.842]  So we'll take a lot of questions and comments from the folks on X Spaces coming up in the second hour and probably continuing on in the third hour, maybe even longer.
[00:06:18.922 --> 00:06:23.186]  So thank you for joining us on this pioneering transmission.
[00:06:23.606 --> 00:06:23.826]  All right.
[00:06:25.127 --> 00:06:26.949]  It's the best analysis I've seen.
[00:06:27.109 --> 00:06:30.672]  At the end of the broadcast today, I'm going to air his 12-minute breakdown.
[00:06:31.792 --> 00:06:45.187]  I'm sitting there, my daughter's gone to bed, my other kids are moved out, I'm 15 a couple weeks from now, I'm getting old here, it's gonna be an empty nest, but my six-year-old daughter's asleep, my wife is cleaning the house, she loves to do that at night, fine, don't interrupt her.
[00:06:45.568 --> 00:06:48.711]  So I had a big Twitter storm for about three hours, or X-storm.
[00:06:49.532 --> 00:07:03.457]  And it was just reposting Viva Frye over and over again because he's a great lawyer, he's a great talk show host, but he really nailed it and explained what was going on, not just in that 12-minute analysis or rant, but also in post he did.
[00:07:03.477 --> 00:07:33.937]   So I asked him to come back today and just talk about how big a deal this New York Jury ruling the second one with this Eugene Carroll lady is so we'll talk to him about that first because they beta tested on me now use it on Giuliani Trump and countless others and they admit they want to use it against you fully weaponizing the legal system the courts and the judiciary But first let's show a short clip from yesterday when Trump's lawyer Elena
[00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:40.009]  No.
[00:07:39.829 --> 00:07:42.949]  Then we'll get Viva Fry's breakdown on that.
[00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:43.949]  Here it is.
[00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:44.949]  No, no.
[00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:49.427]  I'm glad you asked me that question.
[00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:53.192]  No, I'm not having any second thoughts about representing President Trump.
[00:07:53.852 --> 00:07:55.493]  It is the proudest thing I could ever do.
[00:07:56.193 --> 00:08:01.694]  What I am having second thoughts about is the license that I stand here with that the people in there are supposed to have.
[00:08:03.487 --> 00:08:08.408]  I have not spoken because I respect my ethics while I'm on trial.
[00:08:09.369 --> 00:08:11.349]  But let me now speak about what has happened.
[00:08:12.229 --> 00:08:18.771]  I have sat on trial after trial for months in this state, the state of New York.
[00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:22.492]  Attorney General Letitia James, and now this.
[00:08:24.593 --> 00:08:24.893]  Weeks.
[00:08:26.363 --> 00:08:26.643]  Weeks.
[00:08:26.903 --> 00:08:27.164]  Why?
[00:08:27.204 --> 00:08:32.548]  Because President Trump is leading in the polls and now we see what you get in New York.
[00:08:33.468 --> 00:08:35.850]  So don't get it twisted, whoever asked me that question.
[00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.492]  I am so proud to stand with President Trump.
[00:08:39.293 --> 00:08:42.475]  But I am not proud to stand with what I saw in that courtroom.
[00:08:43.296 --> 00:08:43.936]  I'm not finished.
[00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:45.558]  Let me just finish and I'll take questions, please.
[00:08:47.119 --> 00:08:56.544]   Before I walked into court, That judge decided that every single defense President Trump had, we were not allowed to raise in front of the jury.
[00:08:56.884 --> 00:09:01.787]  It is in writing, and I encourage the journalists, the real journalists, to take the minute to look at his orders.
[00:09:03.469 --> 00:09:04.990]  There was no proof.
[00:09:06.471 --> 00:09:10.193]  And I couldn't prove that she didn't bring in the dress.
[00:09:10.534 --> 00:09:11.714]  There was no DNA.
[00:09:12.035 --> 00:09:13.135]  There was no expert.
[00:09:13.235 --> 00:09:14.556]  My experts were denied.
[00:09:14.877 --> 00:09:15.477]  Two of them.
[00:09:15.997 --> 00:09:17.959]  Two of them were denied to come in.
[00:09:20.319 --> 00:09:23.882]  They didn't let me bring up that Reid Hoffman funded Ms.
[00:09:23.922 --> 00:09:24.402]  Kaplan.
[00:09:24.702 --> 00:09:25.923]  And you know what we got in there?
[00:09:26.364 --> 00:09:33.850]  That my witness, who was her friend, who said that she is a drug addict and the drug addict is herself.
[00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.973]  That friend, I found out in there, was paid for by Ms.
[00:09:38.013 --> 00:09:40.875]  Kaplan's firm and that is disgusting.
[00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:45.058]  That is a violation of everything I stand for and that is why I stand with Trump.
[00:09:45.939 --> 00:09:52.325]  And that is why so many Americans are so proud that he is running again and so excited to run to the ballot box.
[00:09:52.345 --> 00:09:53.326]  But don't get it twisted.
[00:09:53.386 --> 00:09:55.608]  We are seeing a violation of our justice system.
[00:09:55.888 --> 00:10:01.474]  Ladies and gentlemen, you are not allowed to be stripped of every defense that you have.
[00:10:03.066 --> 00:10:06.449]  You are not allowed to be told that you can't bring it up.
[00:10:06.829 --> 00:10:23.183]  And imagine a point where a judge tells the lawyer before your client, the former President of the United States, the leading candidate and obvious nominee for the Republican Party, before he takes the stand to defend himself, Ms.
[00:10:23.203 --> 00:10:29.993]   Hava, Tell me the questions you're going to ask in open court and tell me exactly what he's going to respond.
[00:10:30.274 --> 00:10:32.577]  And then edited my questions.
[00:10:32.938 --> 00:10:35.702]  Edited the response he was allowed to give.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.101]  And guess what my client did?
[00:10:38.141 --> 00:10:39.061]  He took the stand.
[00:10:39.482 --> 00:10:42.884]  He abided by the rules of this corrupt system that I have seen.
[00:10:42.904 --> 00:10:45.605]  We will immediately appeal.
[00:10:45.905 --> 00:10:48.047]  We will set aside that ridiculous jury.
[00:10:48.307 --> 00:10:50.048]  And I just want to remind you all of one thing.
[00:10:50.308 --> 00:10:53.950]  I will continue with President Trump to fight for everybody's First Amendment right to speak.
[00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:58.493]  Everybody's right to defend themselves when they are wrongfully accused.
[00:10:59.253 --> 00:11:01.775]  And to be able to say, I didn't do it.
[00:11:03.018 --> 00:11:06.781]  And to double and triple and quadruple down and say this is wrong.
[00:11:07.362 --> 00:11:08.162]  This is wrong.
[00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:09.804]  But we are in the state of New York.
[00:11:10.244 --> 00:11:14.968]  We are in a New York jury and that is why we are seeing these witch hunts, these hoaxes as he calls them.
[00:11:15.288 --> 00:11:16.449]  And this is another one of them.
[00:11:16.889 --> 00:11:18.190]  Be brought in New York.
[00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:21.993]  In states where they know they will get juries like this.
[00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:27.881]  It will not deter us from fighting, and I assure you, we didn't win today, but we will win.
[00:11:27.901 --> 00:11:39.507]  The record that was made in there, and the behavior I saw in there, some of which was reported widely today, gave us the most perfect record on appeal, and even if I needed it, which I don't.
[00:11:40.588 --> 00:11:41.969]  We were stripped of every defense.
[00:11:43.757 --> 00:11:45.800]  Every single defense before we walked in there.
[00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:48.004]  And I am proud to stand with President Trump.
[00:11:48.204 --> 00:11:51.930]  Because he showed up, he stood up, he took the stand, and he faced this judge.
[00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:52.671]  And you know what?
[00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:53.893]  I'll continue to do so with him.
[00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:54.434]  Yes.
[00:11:56.177 --> 00:11:57.599]  Of course I've spoken with the President.
[00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:10.333]  If you know even basic constitution or English common law that we're based on, which is very similar in Canada, all across the UK, Australia, the US, it's all very similar.
[00:12:10.493 --> 00:12:15.755]  This is, on a scale of one to ten of tyranny, it's a ten and a half, or it's an eleven, like they say in Spinal Tap.
[00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:24.738]  It is so naked, it is so brazen, and remember, in Texas they said I was guilty and wouldn't let me defend myself, and put on fake evidence.
[00:12:25.672 --> 00:12:26.152]  One-sided.
[00:12:26.332 --> 00:12:27.392]  And then in Connecticut, it went further.
[00:12:27.452 --> 00:12:29.993]  The judge said, I was going to testify that second day.
[00:12:30.013 --> 00:12:30.293]  I didn't.
[00:12:30.693 --> 00:12:39.475]  She said, if you say anything I don't like again, and she gave us a list of 25 things we couldn't say, like I was innocent, that I would be put in jail for six months.
[00:12:39.515 --> 00:12:41.215]  They have six months for contempt in Connecticut.
[00:12:41.955 --> 00:12:43.575]  So I said, I'm not testifying.
[00:12:43.595 --> 00:12:44.215]  This is a fraud.
[00:12:44.235 --> 00:12:51.977]  She's like, with the January 6 Commission, I took the fifth 98 times because they're a pack of criminal liars, not because I'm guilty.
[00:12:52.955 --> 00:12:55.557]  So, Viva Frye has done, I think, the best job.
[00:12:55.577 --> 00:13:03.142]  We're very blessed to have him, even though he's going to take one of his children to a birthday party a little bit late today, to be here with us.
[00:13:03.162 --> 00:13:08.285]  I'm going to try to give him the floor to repeat, but also augment and expand on what he said yesterday.
[00:13:08.345 --> 00:13:10.406]  Thank God it's gone viral.
[00:13:10.907 --> 00:13:16.831]  And, of course, you can find him on X at TheVivaFrye, F-R-E-I, and at VivaBarnesLaw.Locals.com.
[00:13:17.671 --> 00:13:18.772]  This is so dangerous.
[00:13:18.792 --> 00:13:20.613]  I mean, if they were doing this to Democrats, I would be against it.
[00:13:20.653 --> 00:13:24.275]  This is insane, and they admit they're doing it.
[00:13:24.315 --> 00:13:25.495]  So what's really happening here?
[00:13:26.996 --> 00:13:30.999]  Alex, first things first, I'll show you this beautiful thing that I have on my desk behind me.
[00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:34.901]  It's a turtle shell, 30 million years old, and it's beautiful.
[00:13:36.021 --> 00:13:40.264]  Yeah, let's not become fossils, but everyone has to understand what's going on here.
[00:13:40.644 --> 00:13:44.066]  We look back at certain eras where we say it was racial injustice.
[00:13:44.566 --> 00:13:57.352]  You could have a man or a group of men totally innocent and have a racially motivated accusation if it didn't result in street justice like we've seen, you know, political stuff result in street justice today.
[00:13:57.732 --> 00:14:00.013]  It ends up with a total judicial injustice.
[00:14:01.554 --> 00:14:03.454]  It's crazy what is going on.
[00:14:04.255 --> 00:14:11.498]  When they defaulted you based on Connecticut stuff in Texas and then they hold a trial so people think you had a trial.
[00:14:12.074 --> 00:14:17.439]  They strip you, Roger Stone, Steve Bannon, Donald Trump of defenses.
[00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:22.123]  So you can't even assert your innocence because the guilt is a foregone conclusion.
[00:14:22.564 --> 00:14:27.448]  You go to Trump and you go into the Leticia James, Judge Enger on trial.
[00:14:28.053 --> 00:14:33.494]   where they issued a summary judgment determining guilt and then go on for another six weeks
[00:14:33.494 --> 00:14:39.653]   to determine quantum. In this case, you have the original trial in which evidence was not allowed
[00:14:39.653 --> 00:14:47.014]   in front of a partisan, you know, lynch mob of a jury to declare Trump guilty, liable for
[00:14:47.014 --> 00:14:51.413]   defamation and not liable for rape. Remember, the jury did not. And she had no evidence,
[00:14:51.413 --> 00:14:56.453]   so he can't put on evidence. She has no evidence. Well, she had evidence which actually contradicted
[00:14:56.453 --> 00:15:00.014]   her own stories, you know, like dresses that apparently weren't made at the time.
[00:15:00.011 --> 00:15:10.338]  A story so outlandish that Trump just runs through the Bergdorf unnoticed that he can commit sexual battery in a changing room.
[00:15:10.698 --> 00:15:12.780]  It's so outlandish two and a half decades later.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:13.901]  But set that aside.
[00:15:15.553 --> 00:15:23.900]  The accusations were baseless, fabricated out of whole cloth, but nonetheless, you get a politically motivated jury to find guilt.
[00:15:24.121 --> 00:15:28.605]  They didn't think E. Jean Carroll was raped, so they didn't believe her on that, but they believed that there was battery.
[00:15:28.925 --> 00:15:37.852]  And then you get a corrupt, politically motivated judge to come in afterwards and say, no, no, it's sufficiently true to say that Trump was found guilty of rape, even though they specifically said, we don't believe that.
[00:15:38.033 --> 00:15:38.373]  Doesn't matter.
[00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:53.772]  After that, Trump comes out and posts what are two relatively innocuous assertions of innocence on truth, and then she sues for defamation again in the second trial that we've seen, where he wasn't allowed asserting innocence.
[00:15:53.792 --> 00:15:56.814]  They said from the beginning, just like in your trial, the guilt is already proven.
[00:15:57.054 --> 00:15:57.954]  We're here for quantum.
[00:15:58.334 --> 00:16:01.436]  And then they strip him of his defenses in terms of what he can say in his own defense.
[00:16:02.145 --> 00:16:06.748]  The evidence that he can deduce as relates to her potential absolute insanity.
[00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:10.331]  I'll say it because it's my humble opinion and I think I can substantiate it.
[00:16:10.651 --> 00:16:12.612]  She is out of her gourd insane.
[00:16:13.173 --> 00:16:20.177]  I believe that she fabricated this entire story from the episode of Law and Order where someone was sexually assaulted in a changing room in the Bergdorf.
[00:16:20.418 --> 00:16:25.361]  When she comes on Anderson Cooper and talks about rape being sexy, none of this was allowed in.
[00:16:25.541 --> 00:16:30.384]  Couldn't say to the jury that her cat is named after a venereal disease, Vagina T Fireball.
[00:16:30.745 --> 00:16:32.987]   That she You're fascinating to talk to, Anderson.
[00:16:32.806 --> 00:16:36.606]  where she comes off as absolutely insane.
[00:16:36.606 --> 00:16:39.406]  Anderson Cooper almost laughing at how crazy she is.
[00:16:39.406 --> 00:16:41.085]  We'll come back at the end of the break.
[00:16:41.085 --> 00:16:43.366]  You're fascinating to talk to, Anderson.
[00:16:43.366 --> 00:16:45.766]  Oh, rapist, rapist, so sexy.
[00:16:45.766 --> 00:16:51.286]   She's clearly living out some demented fantasies in real time.
[00:16:51.384 --> 00:16:53.204]  And I used to say, you know, like, stay out of trouble.
[00:16:53.504 --> 00:16:56.725]  The joke on my channel is keep your schmeckle in your pants and you'll stay safe.
[00:16:57.205 --> 00:17:09.983]   We're now seeing you don't even have to have ever met the crazy person in order for them to fabricate a two and a half decade old allegation of sexual impropriety, whatever, and then Sue you in real time.
[00:17:10.023 --> 00:17:12.286]  By the way, worth noting, I know everybody's highlighted it.
[00:17:12.766 --> 00:17:19.373]  The legislation that extended the statute of limitations for sexual battery claims was initiated and supported by her.
[00:17:19.754 --> 00:17:26.902]  She then files the complaint, the lawsuit, after she had successfully, what is the word when people get, lobbied.
[00:17:27.322 --> 00:17:38.333]  For the extension of the statute of limitations to file civil claims, and then gets in front of a jury, they would have convicted or found liable a ham sandwich if you said it was a Republican ham sandwich.
[00:17:38.593 --> 00:17:45.000]  And I'm looking at this, and I'm saying, I don't care if you're Republican, Democrat, white, black, Jew, Muslim, Christian, whatever.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.965]  If you look at this and say, I hate Trump, therefore I like this, you're part of the problem.
[00:17:50.485 --> 00:18:03.035]  This is exactly how, historically, you had racially motivated convictions, you had racially motivated lynch mobs, in the absence of judicial justice, carrying out the will of a racially prejudiced mob.
[00:18:03.055 --> 00:18:05.016]  Yeah, just because they were black, they were guilty.
[00:18:05.296 --> 00:18:10.440]  This is now, just as you said last night in your analysis, just because you're Republican or Conservative, you're guilty.
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.502]  I mean, this is a high-tech lynch mob.
[00:18:13.608 --> 00:18:18.732]  It's a lawfare lynch mob, and they think now, well, it was done before a court, a jury of your peers?
[00:18:19.133 --> 00:18:19.753]  Horse crap!
[00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.975]  You can't get a jury of your peers in D.C.
[00:18:22.155 --> 00:18:23.736]  You can't get a jury of your peers in New York.
[00:18:23.756 --> 00:18:31.502]  Well, notice how they do it in Austin, or they do it in New York, or they do it in key jurisdictions in Connecticut or D.C.
[00:18:31.823 --> 00:18:33.144]  Those are their four favorite places.
[00:18:34.361 --> 00:18:37.424]  It is, it's obvious, patently transparent.
[00:18:37.984 --> 00:18:47.632]  And they go, and I mean, they will find guilt, notwithstanding any dearth of evidence, or they will exonerate, acquit, notwithstanding damning evidence.
[00:18:47.652 --> 00:18:57.120]  You got Michael Sussman, remember Hillary Clinton's lawyer, who actually billed the Clinton campaign to meet with the FBI to give them that bogus steel dossier, actually billed for it.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.923]  Debt to rights, legally speaking, well, he gets acquitted in D.C.
[00:19:01.443 --> 00:19:07.948]  Trump, standing up, facing this two and a half decade old fabrication, is found liable.
[00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:13.852]  And liable even though they don't believe her on the rape, they believe her on the sexual battery, or they choose to believe her on the sexual battery.
[00:19:15.163 --> 00:19:16.324]  The system's falling apart.
[00:19:16.604 --> 00:19:23.431]  And then, set all that aside, the absolutely ludicrous quantum that they are awarding to defendants.
[00:19:23.451 --> 00:19:25.973]  In your case, one point some odd billion dollars.
[00:19:26.513 --> 00:19:29.156]  You're talking genocide-level compensation amounts.
[00:19:29.316 --> 00:19:30.597]  And by the way, that wasn't enough.
[00:19:30.897 --> 00:19:31.918]  People never believe this when I say it.
[00:19:31.938 --> 00:19:36.062]  I was with Patrick McDavid a year ago, or eight months ago, and he didn't believe me anywhere.
[00:19:36.082 --> 00:19:36.622]  He halfway did.
[00:19:36.883 --> 00:19:43.325]   And they pulled up Bloomberg Connecticut Sandy Hook plaintiffs say $1.6 billion or whatever, not enough.
[00:19:43.645 --> 00:19:47.706]  We want $2.67 trillion, the GDP of India.
[00:19:48.307 --> 00:19:57.409]  And then they put on fake financial evidence when I gave them tax returns and federal bankruptcy, saying I have no money but a house and a piece of property that isn't even worth a few million dollars.
[00:19:57.709 --> 00:20:01.390]  And the judge said, in both states, you will stand down.
[00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.491]  And they put fake financial experts on.
[00:20:03.731 --> 00:20:07.413]   And the judge, when I When the jury was out, I said, your honor, I am bankrupt.
[00:20:07.474 --> 00:20:08.014]  I'm out of money.
[00:20:08.254 --> 00:20:09.676]  She said, you are a liar.
[00:20:10.537 --> 00:20:12.499]  And you, you, you will stop lying.
[00:20:12.539 --> 00:20:13.740]  So she just is God.
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:19.746]  Just like in New York, he doesn't get a jury trial on the Trump organization saying that Mar-a-Lago is worth more than $18 million.
[00:20:19.766 --> 00:20:22.369]  We can sell for 500 million to a million right now.
[00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:23.610]  And there's no jury.
[00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:24.851]  The judge is deciding.
[00:20:25.111 --> 00:20:27.434]  Again, this is not how freedom is supposed to work.
[00:20:28.288 --> 00:20:37.932]  Just remember, everyone has to remember or know what Judge Engelron, who's the judge in the Leticia James Broad case, said in a recording eight years ago.
[00:20:38.293 --> 00:20:42.614]  He's talking to a bunch of journalists and he says, look, I've got tools to do what I want.
[00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:46.436]  I can bypass a jury verdict with a Janov, a judgment notwithstanding a verdict.
[00:20:46.776 --> 00:20:49.357]  I've got tools and I've got my own biases.
[00:20:49.618 --> 00:20:50.118]  I'm a human.
[00:20:50.138 --> 00:20:51.078]  I have my own biases.
[00:20:51.338 --> 00:20:59.004]   And what this Judge Engelron did, He actually said, I have my own emotions, which I follow, which is, I'm not a lawyer like you, but isn't that the cardinal rule, don't follow emotion?
[00:21:01.546 --> 00:21:05.370]  Alex, he even admitted, am I making the law or am I following the law?
[00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.252]  Judges are supposed to follow the law, not make the law.
[00:21:08.272 --> 00:21:14.057]  What he basically admitted is that he's a judicial activist who has the tools to carry out his biases in real time.
[00:21:14.237 --> 00:21:14.798]  And we're seeing it.
[00:21:15.178 --> 00:21:17.580]  So what he said eight years ago has come to fruition in that case.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.501]  This judge here, guilt.
[00:21:19.982 --> 00:21:21.043]  You can't admit evidence.
[00:21:21.783 --> 00:21:24.224]  Severely restricted what Trump could say himself.
[00:21:24.364 --> 00:21:33.749]  And in the part of the show trial, you're about to say it, he makes him get on the stand, but has a whole list of things he can't talk about, or his lawyer goes to jail, or he gets defaulted.
[00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:34.389]  Explain that.
[00:21:35.449 --> 00:21:40.932]  Well, he literally said, first of all, I learned this from Alina Haba and from watching Inner City Press tweet about this.
[00:21:42.006 --> 00:21:48.569]  They asked to vet the questions that Alina Haba is going to ask her own clients and then to know the answers in advance.
[00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:51.690]  I mean, this is this is kangaroo show trials.
[00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:57.753]  I mean, it cannot get more paradigmatic of a show trial than scripting the questions and scripting the answers.
[00:21:57.773 --> 00:22:00.554]  We said this in your case in Texas.
[00:22:01.094 --> 00:22:05.580]  It's a literal show trial when they are controlling what can be asked and what can be answered.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:15.231]  And so the judge severely restricts Trump's testimony after or before, I don't remember when he threatened to lock up Alina Haba, said you're going to do some time, you might risk doing some time.
[00:22:15.392 --> 00:22:16.193]  Can you imagine this?
[00:22:16.793 --> 00:22:19.035]  And then people are going to say, well, I really hate Trump, so it's worth it.
[00:22:19.236 --> 00:22:29.105]  Oh, after all, I believe E. Jean Carroll, a woman who goes on to say that I would not press charges against Trump because it would be disrespectful to the women south of the border who are getting raped.
[00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:30.326]  Do you know what that means to me?
[00:22:30.687 --> 00:22:34.671]  It means that you weren't, and that you know that it would be an outrageous sham.
[00:22:35.171 --> 00:22:36.692]  Of a criminal charge to do it.
[00:22:36.753 --> 00:22:37.253]  Exactly.
[00:22:37.553 --> 00:22:39.055]  And when I'm wrong, I got to correct myself.
[00:22:39.115 --> 00:22:40.296]  I apologize to listeners.
[00:22:40.316 --> 00:22:41.497]  I got it wrong by millions.
[00:22:42.297 --> 00:22:43.158]  It was not, it was not 2.67.
[00:22:43.618 --> 00:22:47.262]  It was 2.75 trillion they asked for.
[00:22:47.282 --> 00:22:47.562]  Sorry.
[00:22:48.923 --> 00:22:49.864]  Just imagine this, Alex.
[00:22:49.904 --> 00:22:55.589]  And they gave the FBI agents who didn't have anyone get killed at the day of, didn't get injured himself.
[00:22:55.869 --> 00:22:57.350]  Never, never said his name.
[00:22:57.611 --> 00:22:58.792]  None of my reporters said his name.
[00:22:58.832 --> 00:22:59.152]  What, 95 million?
[00:23:01.416 --> 00:23:02.477]  $90,000,000 to that guy.
[00:23:02.497 --> 00:23:12.185]  They give $65,000,000 punitive damages to E. Jean Carroll after awarding her, in my view, what is ridiculous, $7,500,000 or $7,300,000 compensatory damages?
[00:23:12.525 --> 00:23:18.671]  First of all, the woman never had a reputation in the first place, and if she did, it was the reputation of a woman who names her cat Vagina T. Fireball.
[00:23:18.871 --> 00:23:25.758]  So let me ask you this, let me ask you this, because you got into this last night, you warned everybody, call it communism, call it fascism, this is the end of freedom.
[00:23:26.479 --> 00:23:27.681]  What needs to be done now?
[00:23:27.741 --> 00:23:32.225]  Because they've weaponized everything, it's not just happening here, it's happening in Europe with the judiciary.
[00:23:32.726 --> 00:23:33.887]  What needs to happen now?
[00:23:33.947 --> 00:23:39.193]  Because every time they do this it backfires, at least it gets Trump's numbers up, but it's still incredibly dangerous.
[00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:40.855]  What do you think needs to happen?
[00:23:41.906 --> 00:23:42.746]  I would say two things.
[00:23:43.347 --> 00:23:47.769]  The first of which is the higher courts have to step in and put an end to the insanity.
[00:23:48.009 --> 00:23:50.930]  I would not rely on the Court of Appeals out of New York or D.C.
[00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:51.450]  for that matter.
[00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:57.533]  They've been proving themselves not just unreliable but equally as weaponized and partisan, you know, ratifying these gag orders.
[00:23:57.953 --> 00:24:01.855]  Which prevents a defendant from defending himself in the court of public opinion.
[00:24:02.475 --> 00:24:02.916]  Madness!
[00:24:02.976 --> 00:24:05.937]  So I wouldn't rely on the New York Court of Appeals, but I don't know.
[00:24:06.077 --> 00:24:08.979]  I mean, I don't know if the Supreme Court gets involved in state decisions like this.
[00:24:09.539 --> 00:24:14.201]  Everyone should know I'm a Quebec Canadian lawyer, former, but I can, you know, ask the right questions.
[00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:17.983]  The higher courts have to step in and say, this is insanity.
[00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:21.105]  You cannot strip people of their defenses in front of a jury trial.
[00:24:21.285 --> 00:24:24.206]  Go back and order a new trial and let the evidence come in.
[00:24:24.586 --> 00:24:30.551]   You know, in Quebec, When a judge refuses to allow evidence in, it's an appealable by right, like right away.
[00:24:30.711 --> 00:24:36.235]  You can't remedy that error later on in trial once you've already gone and not had that evidence be admitted.
[00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:38.477]  I hope I'm not misremembering, but either way.
[00:24:39.204 --> 00:24:45.628]  To deny evidence is one of the most... To deny a fair trial, and I'm not going to say this, I don't have to write myself into the story, it's just true.
[00:24:46.108 --> 00:25:05.880]  Imagine, I'm sitting there with more bills than money I had, so I was like almost insolvent in the Texas trial, insolvent by the Connecticut trial, almost a year and a half ago now, and I see the judge going, on national TV, you're a liar, you're worth $400 million, and now we're going to have a day of a financial expert that's never reviewed your books, Shay, you're almost a billionaire.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:13.586]  And I'm just sitting there knowing that I never had more than a few million dollars in the bank, a couple nice houses, and it's like the rape of justice.
[00:25:13.766 --> 00:25:15.668]  I didn't feel victimized myself.
[00:25:15.848 --> 00:25:23.875]  I felt scared for everybody, because collectively this was insane tyranny, and I knew, I said at the time, and you said, this is going to be used on everybody, and now it has been.
[00:25:24.835 --> 00:25:27.417]  Alex, it's not, you could be worth as much as Elon Musk.
[00:25:27.537 --> 00:25:31.380]  It doesn't rationalize or justify or explain away the injustice.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.302]  It's absolute insanity.
[00:25:33.322 --> 00:25:36.244]  They're using the same tactic now over and over again.
[00:25:36.884 --> 00:25:44.910]  Deny defenses, default judgments, summary judgments, so the only trial that the public knows of is on damages and not on the merits.
[00:25:45.391 --> 00:25:51.015]  Come up with these outlandish, punitive, they're punitive, but in the politically punitive, not judicially punitive.
[00:25:51.035 --> 00:25:55.688]  Oh that's another thing, jurors went public, I think you talked about this, and said we did whatever we had to to stop Trump.
[00:25:55.928 --> 00:25:57.111]  So they're admitting it's political.
[00:25:59.805 --> 00:26:03.327]  Look, punitive damages are intended to deter, you know, the bad conduct.
[00:26:03.788 --> 00:26:12.874]  But this is just, they just want to bankrupt Trump and or issue a ruling that is not, that you can't bankrupt yourself out of.
[00:26:13.154 --> 00:26:18.477]  But the bottom line is, they are literally trying to just take someone's assets and give them to somebody else.
[00:26:18.517 --> 00:26:19.938]  So what do we do about this?
[00:26:20.097 --> 00:26:24.137]   I mean, the reason I keep raising this, Viva Frye, is I'm sitting there, they've been given
[00:26:24.137 --> 00:26:27.538]  my tax returns years before.
[00:26:27.538 --> 00:26:29.856]  They've been given that, they know it's all a lie.
[00:26:29.856 --> 00:26:35.017]   And the judge is using her authority to a jury to say he's already guilty and he's lying
[00:26:35.017 --> 00:26:37.857]  and he's got all this money and she has no evidence.
[00:26:37.857 --> 00:26:39.697]  She just says it.
[00:26:39.697 --> 00:26:42.297]  It's like next level fraud.
[00:26:42.297 --> 00:26:46.697]   Don't they get this will destroy any credibility of judges in the future?
[00:26:47.535 --> 00:26:50.776]  I mean, the bottom line is they don't care so long as they're wielding the power.
[00:26:51.176 --> 00:26:59.238]  And the other thing is, I genuinely, genuinely get the impression now they'd rather burn the house down than hand it over after it's been, you know, after it's been taken over.
[00:27:00.098 --> 00:27:02.959]  So, but what has the courts, the higher courts have to get involved.
[00:27:02.979 --> 00:27:05.479]  They have to get involved on the, you know, the immunity claims.
[00:27:05.499 --> 00:27:06.719]  They have to get involved on the RICO.
[00:27:06.899 --> 00:27:09.780]  They have to get involved because this is not how a judicial system can be used.
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.421]  Second thing, some of these judges are elected.
[00:27:12.701 --> 00:27:14.421]  Most of them are appointed.
[00:27:14.461 --> 00:27:15.901]  I think they can be impeached.
[00:27:15.981 --> 00:27:21.923]  So it's either, you got to get some, not fight fire with fire, because you don't want to become the monster that you're battling.
[00:27:21.943 --> 00:27:23.403]  You haven't beaten the monster.
[00:27:23.443 --> 00:27:28.104]  The Texas judge, who by the way is a laughing stock, even the Democratic Party put in by Soros, she was elected.
[00:27:28.124 --> 00:27:29.985]  Yeah, Judge Guerra Gamble.
[00:27:30.959 --> 00:27:40.826]  And so you just have to put that on blast and vote them out where they're elected the next time they come up for election, and impeach them where you can, and have investigations like they're doing in Georgia now.
[00:27:40.846 --> 00:27:43.147]  They're going to get Fannie Willis investigated.
[00:27:43.208 --> 00:27:45.149]  I don't know if they have the political... By the way, speak to her.
[00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:47.971]  I think you'll get a few minutes left, but then any other comments you want to make, appreciate the time.
[00:27:48.411 --> 00:27:54.415]  The arrogance of her to hire her boyfriend, to give him $600,000, to have him pay it back to her.
[00:27:54.435 --> 00:27:56.737]  I mean, just the arrogance of these people.
[00:27:57.938 --> 00:28:03.541]  Well, that's after she'd announced, you know, like, I don't date my inferiors because I don't want to make the taxpayers pay for this.
[00:28:03.981 --> 00:28:07.744]  It's the audacity and the brazenness of the corruption.
[00:28:07.924 --> 00:28:09.785]  To them, I don't even think it's corrupt anymore.
[00:28:10.185 --> 00:28:13.267]  You ask the prosecution or E. Jean Couch, like, no, this is justice.
[00:28:13.707 --> 00:28:19.310]  Deny someone I hate of all their defenses and, you know, get a totally politically motivated verdict.
[00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:20.170]  You go to Georgia.
[00:28:20.411 --> 00:28:21.431]  Oh, there's nothing corrupt about it.
[00:28:21.471 --> 00:28:22.792]  I'm allowed hiring who I want.
[00:28:23.672 --> 00:28:28.535]  And then paying them exorbitant amounts of money without running through the ethics process or the legal process of Georgia.
[00:28:28.836 --> 00:28:33.298]  Then having them kick back some to me through, what are those things when you go on boats?
[00:28:33.398 --> 00:28:35.379]  Cruises, vacations, going to Australia.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.621]  And the brazenness of all of it.
[00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:38.301]  It's immoral.
[00:28:38.581 --> 00:28:39.362]  It's debauchery.
[00:28:39.562 --> 00:28:41.143]  But it's brazen political corruption.
[00:28:41.543 --> 00:28:44.705]  And it needs to have the lid blown off so the public knows.
[00:28:44.745 --> 00:28:46.646]  Because I don't care if you're a Democrat.
[00:28:47.007 --> 00:28:48.507]  This should shock your conscience.
[00:28:48.567 --> 00:28:49.388]  This is how empires end.
[00:28:51.249 --> 00:28:58.991]  When the courts get weaponized to go after adversaries, you will not evade being the one on the wall at some point in time.
[00:28:59.191 --> 00:29:03.151]  You might just get there later than others, but it will come for you, one way or the other.
[00:29:03.171 --> 00:29:06.472]  Well, that's why smart civilizations have chivalry and rules and don't do this.
[00:29:06.852 --> 00:29:08.232]  That's lasting civilization.
[00:29:08.272 --> 00:29:10.253]  Civilizations end once this is done.
[00:29:10.293 --> 00:29:36.032]   I want to get closing comments from you with what else is on your radar in this huge subject and where this is going, but since you mentioned it, Here is Tucker Carlson talking about who is Reid Hoffman, this big Epstein associate, and then we have to understand that the judge in this second kangaroo court where Trump said he was innocent when he was found guilty before, not of raping her, but of assaulting her, no evidence, that was $5 million.
[00:29:36.072 --> 00:29:37.313]  Now this is $80-something million.
[00:29:38.214 --> 00:29:46.563]  The judge is the main famous corrupt judge that the Epstein cases were given to that protected King Charles's brother and went after the women and did all this.
[00:29:46.603 --> 00:29:49.186]  So it's literally an Epstein judge on top of it.
[00:29:49.206 --> 00:29:50.528]  So here's a couple of these clips back to back.
[00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:55.951]  Civilization activist Reid Hoffman, for example, is a major Haley supporter.
[00:29:56.051 --> 00:29:57.692]  Reid Hoffman is the founder of LinkedIn.
[00:29:57.772 --> 00:29:59.393]  He's a friend of Jeffrey Epstein's.
[00:29:59.433 --> 00:30:01.513]  He was a visitor to Petto Island, in fact.
[00:30:01.713 --> 00:30:05.715]  He's also the guy who funded E. Jean Carroll's sexual assault case against Donald Trump.
[00:30:05.795 --> 00:30:08.255]  Reid Hoffman is a Democratic mega-donor.
[00:30:08.395 --> 00:30:11.677]  In 2020, he gave a million dollars to David Brock's American Bridge Pact.
[00:30:11.857 --> 00:30:15.238]   That's a group designed to physically harass Republican candidates.
[00:30:15.278 --> 00:30:22.062]  Hoffman's money has also helped to prop up the authoritarian governor of California, Gavin Newsom, as well as many others on approximately the same team.
[00:30:22.202 --> 00:30:26.725]  So what's interesting is this cycle, Reid Hoffman is all in on Nikki Haley.
[00:30:26.805 --> 00:30:30.907]  His cash is paid for one of the most shameless propaganda operations in memory.
[00:30:30.947 --> 00:30:37.631]  So the very same people who told you four years ago that Joe Biden was a jovial, moderate grandfather is trying to return America to normal.
[00:30:37.771 --> 00:30:42.834]  Those same people are now trying to sell Nikki Haley as a conservative woman of principle.
[00:30:44.025 --> 00:30:44.906]  You don't feel like a victim?
[00:30:45.266 --> 00:30:47.768]  I was not thrown on the ground and ravished.
[00:30:48.068 --> 00:30:52.212]  The word rape carries so many sexual connotations.
[00:30:52.532 --> 00:30:54.514]  This was not sexual.
[00:30:55.314 --> 00:30:58.517]  It hurt.
[00:30:58.537 --> 00:31:03.141]  I think most people think of rape as a violent assault.
[00:31:03.301 --> 00:31:06.063]  I think most people think of rape as being sexy.
[00:31:07.764 --> 00:31:08.465]  Let's take a short break.
[00:31:08.484 --> 00:31:10.744]  I think of the fantasies.
[00:31:10.744 --> 00:31:14.086]   We've got a ticket If you can stick around, we'll talk more on the other side.
[00:31:14.106 --> 00:31:14.666]  You're fascinating.
[00:31:15.727 --> 00:31:19.650]  I noticed this was trending at the top of X today.
[00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:24.253]  Hundreds of millions of views of her and all the other loom ball stuff she does.
[00:31:24.953 --> 00:31:25.934]  Insane.
[00:31:26.154 --> 00:31:29.896]  Viva Frye, lawyer, talk show host, really smart guy.
[00:31:29.916 --> 00:31:34.559]  Everybody, we're going to air your great analysis from last night at the end of the show coming up in a couple hours.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.201]  But just any closing points you'd like to make that we haven't covered.
[00:31:38.257 --> 00:31:42.179]  Do not let them provoke you into doing something stupid, full stop.
[00:31:42.339 --> 00:31:46.461]  Public mockery I don't think can be undervalued, I don't think it can be overvalued enough.
[00:31:46.941 --> 00:31:52.503]  Do not let them trigger you, provoke you into violence, threats, or whatever, because that is exactly what they want.
[00:31:52.764 --> 00:31:54.544]  These are antagonistic moves.
[00:31:54.905 --> 00:31:57.166]  They're the moves of a desperate...
[00:31:58.326 --> 00:32:00.207]  Failing monster, for lack of a better word.
[00:32:00.507 --> 00:32:02.307]  So don't let it provoke you into doing something stupid.
[00:32:02.547 --> 00:32:06.968]  Raise awareness, criticize the living hell out of it, put it on blast, and shame them.
[00:32:07.309 --> 00:32:10.009]  But stay lawful, stay law-abiding, and don't do anything stupid.
[00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:12.170]  I totally agree with you.
[00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:17.431]  I know you gotta go, go to your child's birthday party, but just, you've got so many great points, and I interrupted a lot.
[00:32:17.831 --> 00:32:19.752]  Any other facets you didn't cover of all this?
[00:32:19.772 --> 00:32:23.953]  You did great breakdowns of just how they're escalating, and it's getting more intense.
[00:32:24.253 --> 00:32:26.514]  If we don't stop this, what do you expect to come next?
[00:32:29.362 --> 00:32:38.230]  I think they'll keep coming with these judgments and empowering the dominoes of momentum, other jurisdictions to convict and keep taking this further.
[00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:39.891]  I got to all the points.
[00:32:40.151 --> 00:32:42.893]  I have to think I'll probably remember one when I'm driving and kick myself.
[00:32:42.953 --> 00:32:45.175]  But no, I mean, we just pay attention to this.
[00:32:45.656 --> 00:32:46.616]  Don't overreact to it.
[00:32:46.897 --> 00:32:47.697]  Put it on blast.
[00:32:47.777 --> 00:32:51.420]  But don't tolerate it, even if you are politically inclined to do so.
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.722]  This is not a justice system if it works like this.
[00:32:53.983 --> 00:32:55.564]  It is a pure kangaroo court system.
[00:32:55.884 --> 00:32:56.665]  Show trial system.
[00:32:57.305 --> 00:32:59.347]  Communist type fashion, whatever you want to call it.
[00:32:59.907 --> 00:33:03.950]  It's punitive and it's not justice and that's this is how things fall apart.
[00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:10.755]  Well, that's what you said at the end of that incredible analysis last night was It doesn't matter who you are what your political view is.
[00:33:10.815 --> 00:33:11.616]  This is tyranny.
[00:33:11.916 --> 00:33:17.500]  This will always blow back and I would never If they had trials of Bill Clinton and wouldn't let him put on defense.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:27.147]   I'd say that he has to go free I mean, it's better that you know a Criminal go free than innocent people go to jail.
[00:33:27.187 --> 00:33:31.331]  I forget the famous saying, I think by the U.S.
[00:33:31.411 --> 00:33:35.014]  A hundred guilty men go free than, you know, imprison one innocent person.
[00:33:35.455 --> 00:33:41.560]  But also appreciate, this is, in my view, when I refer to it as communism, it's sort of like a colloquial term.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:45.844]  This is the state finding a lawfare way of appropriating private assets.
[00:33:46.164 --> 00:33:51.971]  They go in, they fabricate the fraud charges against Trump in New York, overestimating his own property.
[00:33:52.251 --> 00:33:55.215]  Then they estimate it at a wildly lower-than-market rate.
[00:33:55.515 --> 00:34:00.101]  Then they'll say, we need to disgorge you now of $300 million because that's your penalty.
[00:34:00.461 --> 00:34:02.283]  Oh, but Mar-a-Lago is only worth $30 million.
[00:34:02.404 --> 00:34:09.130]   I mean, this is a way a communist regime So what it is is what Thomas Jefferson warned of.
[00:34:09.051 --> 00:34:14.411]   with what's-her-face, E. Jean Carroll, you've got basically a communist jury saying we like
[00:34:14.411 --> 00:34:18.011]   E. Jean Carroll politically, we do not like Donald Trump politically, so let's just take
[00:34:18.011 --> 00:34:19.011]  $100 million from Donald Trump.
[00:34:19.011 --> 00:34:24.851]   So what it is, is what Thomas Jefferson warned of, it's mob rule weaponizing not just the
[00:34:24.851 --> 00:34:30.131]  judiciary, but I guess the final judiciary, the people.
[00:34:30.131 --> 00:34:34.930]   Incredible job, Viva Frye, people can find you at vivabarneslaw.levels.com and on X at
[00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:35.930]  Viva Frye.
[00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:38.491]  Thank you so much, incredible job.
[00:34:38.491 --> 00:34:39.491]  Thank you very much, anytime.
[00:34:39.491 --> 00:34:43.490]   All right, we're going to go to a quick little breakdown of a few newscasts and then come
[00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:47.691]   back with Michael Yawn, who is, at least from yesterday, still in Panama.
[00:34:47.691 --> 00:34:49.891]   He's an expert on the Texas border and what's happening there.
[00:34:49.891 --> 00:34:52.651]  We've got reporters on their way.
[00:34:52.651 --> 00:34:55.090]  Huge developments unfolding there.
[00:34:55.913 --> 00:35:02.179]  We're going to go to these local newscasts in Texas, where Texas is saying, oh, you've got your demands.
[00:35:02.219 --> 00:35:05.362]  Well, Ken Paxton, the Attorney General, has his demands of Biden.
[00:35:05.642 --> 00:35:07.323]  We'll break it all down straight ahead.
[00:35:07.343 --> 00:35:09.405]  Then after Michael Yan leaves us, we're going to stay with us if you'd like.
[00:35:09.705 --> 00:35:14.990]  We're going to take your live questions on air from X Spaces.
[00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:34.229]  We'll be right back.
[00:35:34.088 --> 00:35:41.088]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:35:41.088 --> 00:36:02.368]   Also at the border today, it was a deadline for Homeland Security to set up for Texas
[00:36:02.368 --> 00:36:04.967]  to give federal authorities access to Eagle Pass.
[00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:06.671]  There's been a lot of back and forth for this.
[00:36:06.711 --> 00:36:08.212]  Jason Allen has been following it all.
[00:36:08.552 --> 00:36:15.196]  Jason, we know Texas leaders made it very clear tonight that National Guard troops and law enforcement on the border are not budget.
[00:36:15.396 --> 00:36:16.257]  They absolutely are.
[00:36:16.297 --> 00:36:22.140]  Texas responded Friday to Washington's demands for border access with demands of its own for the federal government.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:27.943]  Demands for proof, wrote Attorney General Ken Paxton, of the government's authority to turn a Texas park into a port of entry.
[00:36:29.847 --> 00:36:35.929]  Texas responded Friday to Washington's demands for border access with demands of its own for the federal government.
[00:36:36.329 --> 00:36:42.891]  Demands for proof, wrote Attorney General Ken Paxton, of the government's authority to turn a Texas park into a port of entry.
[00:36:43.191 --> 00:36:51.713]  Any time you might spend suing Texas should be redirected toward enforcing the immigration laws Congress already has on the books, Paxton wrote.
[00:36:52.273 --> 00:37:03.219]  A strong response came as Customs and Border Protection officially reported more than 302,000 encounters at the southern border in December, the highest monthly number ever recorded.
[00:37:03.659 --> 00:37:07.321]  More people than the entire population of the city of Plano.
[00:37:07.901 --> 00:37:17.604]  Governor Greg Abbott said today he had asked the president eight times to help, with no response, giving him constitutional authority to protect the state from an invasion.
[00:37:17.984 --> 00:37:22.605]  That's a little strange, because we're not talking about a declaration of war by a foreign country.
[00:37:22.785 --> 00:37:24.806]  We're not talking about a military invasion.
[00:37:25.086 --> 00:37:36.949]  Dallas appellate lawyer David Cole thinks the invasion argument has some weaknesses, but he said Texas may be able to make an argument on exactly how much control over immigration the federal government actually has.
[00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:42.350]  How much preemptive power does federal law have in those areas?
[00:37:42.831 --> 00:37:43.831]  Is it automatic?
[00:37:43.971 --> 00:37:47.492]  The entire area is taken off the table for a state to ever talk about?
[00:37:47.872 --> 00:37:48.672]  Or is it more limited?
[00:37:50.523 --> 00:37:51.063]  Cole agreed.
[00:37:51.263 --> 00:37:57.644]  It is very awkward right now having military and law enforcement both on opposite sides of all of this down at the border.
[00:37:57.664 --> 00:38:05.906]  The governor also noted today he believes all 25 states that are backing Texas in its efforts would be willing to send troops to help if they're needed.
[00:38:06.186 --> 00:38:08.127]  Yeah, big issue in our backyard, Jason.
[00:38:08.147 --> 00:38:09.267]  So we'll be following all of it.
[00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:10.107]  Thank you for the update.
[00:38:10.927 --> 00:38:18.629]  Ladies and gentlemen, no great country can say it is secure without being able to control its borders.
[00:38:19.329 --> 00:38:19.649]  Period.
[00:38:20.768 --> 00:38:26.112]  What I would do about it, or that I propose to do about it, almost 13 years ago.
[00:38:26.953 --> 00:38:40.663]  I would radically ramp up the number of border security guards we have, the use of electronic surveillance material we have to guard the border, and a number of what they call virtual fences.
[00:38:40.683 --> 00:38:41.703]  They're not literally fences.
[00:38:42.104 --> 00:38:47.448]  Virtual fences, from aerostat balloons on to where we, whereby, we can control the border.
[00:38:48.088 --> 00:38:49.029]  Much, much better.
[00:38:52.731 --> 00:39:04.418]  Well, if you're a TV viewer or listening to us on X, and people are putting it all over X right now, they're saying, why does Jones have a human skull and a prehistoric 35 million year old saltwater crocodile skull on his desk?
[00:39:05.038 --> 00:39:06.119]  Well, both these are my dad's.
[00:39:06.159 --> 00:39:06.860]  My dad's a doctor.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:07.900]  He had this in medical school.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.561]  He got that in the Middle East.
[00:39:10.042 --> 00:39:13.404]  It was out of the Sahara Desert.
[00:39:15.045 --> 00:39:16.485]  This is extinct, this species.
[00:39:16.565 --> 00:39:17.006]  It's gone.
[00:39:17.066 --> 00:39:17.506]  It failed.
[00:39:17.966 --> 00:39:25.707]   I don't want Future species or aliens, I'm being sarcastic here, to dig us up in the future and say, who is this species?
[00:39:26.987 --> 00:39:28.628]  But our country's being extincted.
[00:39:28.808 --> 00:39:30.428]  The American way of life's being extincted.
[00:39:30.869 --> 00:39:33.790]  They have an anti-human globalist operation taking place.
[00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:36.931]  So this is just illustrative of we don't want to become a fossil.
[00:39:36.951 --> 00:39:40.072]  We don't want to become something that's been destroyed.
[00:39:41.472 --> 00:39:42.812]  So you can say what you want about Abbott.
[00:39:42.832 --> 00:39:44.233]  I don't trust him as far as I can throw him.
[00:39:45.475 --> 00:39:47.897]  But it's gotten 25 states on board.
[00:39:48.117 --> 00:39:50.298]  Massive attention that there's also state pushback.
[00:39:51.619 --> 00:39:56.082]  The feds were going to move in yesterday and throw the Texas State Guard and others out of there.
[00:39:56.162 --> 00:39:56.683]  They didn't.
[00:39:57.183 --> 00:40:00.766]  Now Ken Paxton, the Attorney General, is saying, no, I'm going to block you legally.
[00:40:00.786 --> 00:40:02.146]  You don't control that land federally.
[00:40:02.567 --> 00:40:04.428]  This is an amazing time right now.
[00:40:04.907 --> 00:40:13.186]   But Michael Yon, former special operations operator and then the most probably famous living war correspondent
[00:40:13.186 --> 00:40:18.547]   has been for years as you know, down at the Darien Gap where the UN bases have been set up and expanded
[00:40:18.547 --> 00:40:19.387]  for the invasion.
[00:40:19.387 --> 00:40:23.228]   But he can give real expertise on the Texas border where he has a lot of his crew and reporters as well
[00:40:23.228 --> 00:40:29.106]   and where he's been many times on exactly what's happening and why this is so important.
[00:40:29.106 --> 00:40:34.786]   So Michael Yon, thank you for joining us on this live Saturday emergency broadcast.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.202]  I was just watching you with Viva Frye.
[00:40:39.222 --> 00:40:41.003]  I've watched many hours of his shows.
[00:40:41.023 --> 00:40:44.045]  I would like to get him down to Dairy and Gap.
[00:40:44.065 --> 00:40:49.369]  He's got a very serious sense of justice and a very smart man to benefit down here.
[00:40:49.489 --> 00:40:51.150]  Maybe you can both come at some point.
[00:40:51.891 --> 00:40:53.472]  I'm still down here in Panama.
[00:40:53.492 --> 00:40:54.893]  I'm heading back to Texas soon.
[00:40:55.273 --> 00:41:01.139]  Because for obvious reasons, you know, when it comes to Eagle Pass, I've spent a lot of time down there.
[00:41:01.159 --> 00:41:03.160]  I've spent a lot of time on the Mexican side as well.
[00:41:03.501 --> 00:41:08.025]  So, between Eagle Pass and Piedras Negras, I would say at least a month between those 2.
[00:41:08.345 --> 00:41:11.889]  Piedras Negras is the Mexican side of Eagle Pass, right?
[00:41:12.229 --> 00:41:16.600]   So, I spent almost 2 weeks in Piedras Negras because The U.S.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:23.606]  side would give me such a hassle to to watch what's going on from that side or to talk with aliens who are coming across the Rio Grande.
[00:41:23.907 --> 00:41:31.274]  So I just went over walked across the bridge and went to the for instance I made that photo that was on the Piedras Negras side at the park.
[00:41:31.574 --> 00:41:33.596]  So you can see that bench from the U.S.
[00:41:33.616 --> 00:41:39.482]   side and these are people crossing from Piedras Negras into Eagle Pass.
[00:41:39.502 --> 00:41:40.584]  They're just crossing the river.
[00:41:40.964 --> 00:41:53.583]  Interestingly, I was down there when Governor Abbott was talking about closing off the border another time, and the people were still crossing right in front of me.
[00:41:53.963 --> 00:41:58.687]  So I'm sitting here watching his announcements about how he's doing something Eagle Pass.
[00:41:58.707 --> 00:42:00.769]  That was what?
[00:42:00.949 --> 00:42:01.209]  2022, right?
[00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:02.270]  I think that was June of 2022.
[00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:05.613]  I had left here at Darien Gap.
[00:42:05.773 --> 00:42:06.834]  I'm in Panama City now.
[00:42:07.115 --> 00:42:10.798]  But I had left Darien Gap and I'd gone up to Texas and Mexico again.
[00:42:11.378 --> 00:42:15.502]  And Governor Abbott was doing another one of his K-Faves, another one of his shows.
[00:42:15.902 --> 00:42:20.543]  Saying that they're closing the border and so there I was and he was not closing the border.
[00:42:20.823 --> 00:42:35.487]  You know last night I had dinner down here in Panama with some very interesting friends and we talked about Eagle Pass and and I talked about it in the sense of a grain of pepper which I put a grain of pepper in my hand and I said this is the battleground of Eagle Pass.
[00:42:35.907 --> 00:42:41.208]  This grain of pepper on the table now is how big Eagle Pass is to the U.S.
[00:42:41.268 --> 00:42:42.448]  border, the southern U.S.
[00:42:42.488 --> 00:42:42.788]  border.
[00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:50.919]   It is a grain of pepper where Uh, where governor Abbott and others are drawing people in in the space and time of their choosing.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:58.472]  Now, I just talked with Doc chambers on the phone about an hour ago, you know, good friend of mine who's deeply involved in this.
[00:42:59.511 --> 00:43:11.378]  People like Vice Magazine and the other lefty big hoop earring nose ring people are, you know, are saying that Doc and the rest are rounding up some posse to come hook aliens or migrants.
[00:43:11.418 --> 00:43:12.258]  This is untrue.
[00:43:12.718 --> 00:43:14.959]  Nobody is coming there to do violence.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.620]  For folks that don't know, explain.
[00:43:17.241 --> 00:43:22.904]  Doc is going down there, former Green Beret commander, lieutenant colonel, you know, great patriot, medical doctor.
[00:43:23.624 --> 00:43:26.626]  He's helping lead a caravan down there to draw attention to what's happening.
[00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:30.952]  Right, and they're actually going to go to a Christian retreat center.
[00:43:30.993 --> 00:43:31.933]  That's where I'm going to go.
[00:43:32.394 --> 00:43:35.676]  I'm not going down to get into any gunfights or anything like that.
[00:43:36.037 --> 00:43:36.757]  It's ridiculous.
[00:43:37.198 --> 00:43:38.158]  I'm glad you raised that.
[00:43:38.198 --> 00:43:43.303]  The Washington Post claims, and I'll show the article here, that we're trying to start a civil war with no evidence.
[00:43:43.623 --> 00:43:45.244]  So you talked about it Friday, it went viral.
[00:43:45.544 --> 00:43:46.765]  What is the false flag danger?
[00:43:46.805 --> 00:43:50.849]  We should still go, we should cover it, but we should also watch out for provocateurs.
[00:43:52.079 --> 00:43:52.299]  Right.
[00:43:52.419 --> 00:43:53.860]  I'm going with binoculars, right?
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:54.621]  And my camera.
[00:43:54.781 --> 00:43:57.103]  In fact, I just ordered a new camera lens for this.
[00:43:57.183 --> 00:43:59.004]  So, you know, that's what I'm going with.
[00:43:59.084 --> 00:44:00.866]  I didn't order ammunition or a gun.
[00:44:00.926 --> 00:44:02.167]  I ordered a new camera lens.
[00:44:02.627 --> 00:44:06.050]  So, you know, again, a lot of people don't have any idea who I am.
[00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:08.111]  I've spent many years in wars and conflicts.
[00:44:08.532 --> 00:44:12.835]  I've been in a lot of extremely violent protests where a lot of people died.
[00:44:13.195 --> 00:44:14.456]  Like, you know, not just like 10.
[00:44:14.917 --> 00:44:19.200]  I mean, when I was covering Thailand, there was a couple thousand killed and wounded, right?
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.841]  And I did that twice, 2010 and 2014.
[00:44:22.581 --> 00:44:27.243]  And that doesn't mention the wars and other conflicts I've been to all over the place.
[00:44:27.483 --> 00:44:28.843]  So this is like my office.
[00:44:29.304 --> 00:44:31.444]  I was there on January 6th.
[00:44:31.504 --> 00:44:34.345]  I didn't go in because I sensed that something was off.
[00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:37.026]  I was just there to cover it and watch what was going on.
[00:44:37.426 --> 00:44:38.847]  And I sense it here as well.
[00:44:39.307 --> 00:44:40.308]  It's a mousetrap.
[00:44:40.388 --> 00:44:41.608]  It's a baited mousetrap.
[00:44:41.868 --> 00:44:46.291]  Now, of course, people immediately have come on to my XFeed and said, what are you saying?
[00:44:46.311 --> 00:44:47.211]  We shouldn't stand up?
[00:44:47.431 --> 00:44:48.732]  No, I'm not saying that at all.
[00:44:49.052 --> 00:44:50.713]  I'm saying don't go to their space.
[00:44:50.733 --> 00:44:50.993]  No, no, no.
[00:44:51.153 --> 00:44:57.256]  I wish, because I just trusted in Trump and the Secret Service and everything at January 6th, and I walked right into a trap, and Trump was set up.
[00:44:57.597 --> 00:44:59.638]  We need to know this is a very dangerous situation.
[00:44:59.658 --> 00:45:04.340]  Still go, but damn right, anybody that says we shouldn't be warning people is a fed.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:07.842]  It's like when I used to warn that militias were being infiltrated by feds, which is on record.
[00:45:08.442 --> 00:45:11.231]  Those leaders that were feds would say Jones is anti-militia.
[00:45:11.511 --> 00:45:12.815]  No I'm not, it's in the Constitution.
[00:45:13.096 --> 00:45:15.262]  I'm saying when you get involved in that stuff you better look out.
[00:45:16.741 --> 00:45:20.404]  You know, I saw you speaking in Washington before January 6th.
[00:45:20.484 --> 00:45:21.685]  It was by some hotel.
[00:45:22.065 --> 00:45:22.926]  I was out in the crowd.
[00:45:22.966 --> 00:45:24.667]  I was like, there's Alex, you know?
[00:45:24.947 --> 00:45:25.988]  And I stopped and watched you.
[00:45:26.128 --> 00:45:27.409]  You didn't call for any violence.
[00:45:27.429 --> 00:45:27.870]  You didn't call.
[00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:30.992]  You were just like, you know, we've got to be aware of what's going on.
[00:45:31.012 --> 00:45:33.714]  And I'm sure a lot of people videotape that and put it online.
[00:45:33.734 --> 00:45:35.235]  I mean, you weren't calling for it.
[00:45:35.376 --> 00:45:37.697]  Just like now, you're not calling for any violence.
[00:45:37.777 --> 00:45:38.358]  None of us are.
[00:45:38.658 --> 00:45:44.202]  None of us are calling to slash the tires of the buses that cost $1,000 each or anything like that.
[00:45:45.003 --> 00:45:48.524]  There are other people, but we know Antifa is gonna be down there.
[00:45:49.764 --> 00:46:01.007]  Oh yeah, you know Antifa, the people that write for some of these left-wing rags that are attacking, you know, Doc Chambers this morning, the people with the big hoop earrings and the nose rings that they get caught in their keyboards.
[00:46:01.307 --> 00:46:03.168]  You ever notice these guys are all atheists?
[00:46:03.248 --> 00:46:04.148]  I'm out with them a lot.
[00:46:04.448 --> 00:46:10.050]   Like, I spend a lot of time with them in Portland and Philadelphia and Washington and Atlanta, other places.
[00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:14.912]  I was going all over the place with these people and I would just sit out there and listen to them talk at midnight.
[00:46:14.952 --> 00:46:18.174]  You know, they would talk right in front of me because I would dress like a bum, right?
[00:46:18.494 --> 00:46:25.178]  And just because I wanted to pick up real atmospherics so when people report, I can sense whether or not they're telling the truth.
[00:46:25.458 --> 00:46:27.119]  This is what I did as a war correspondent.
[00:46:27.459 --> 00:46:42.030]   I spent years in various wars and often I would just be out with the guards, with the soldiers that were doing guard duty at three in the morning, you know, and picking up the atmospherics so that I would When did I hear the ring of truth?
[00:46:42.591 --> 00:46:43.973]  When did things sound truthful?
[00:46:44.233 --> 00:46:51.983]  And it's very clear that the patriots that are going down there and the big group that Doc Chambers and others are organizing are not going there for violence.
[00:46:52.103 --> 00:46:52.564]  Period.
[00:46:52.844 --> 00:46:53.725]  I know these people.
[00:46:53.765 --> 00:46:54.947]  They're just not going to do it.
[00:46:54.967 --> 00:46:59.671]   They're going to Peacefully, you know, watch and see what goes on and that's it.
[00:46:59.751 --> 00:47:25.291]   I made this video, I think, yeah, that was on the Eagle Pass side, actually, in the sawgrass and late, you know, it's pretty dangerous out there, by the way, at nighttime, but I would just go out there and wait, you know, sometimes alone and of course with thermals and that sort of thing, which actually thermals don't do a lot of good in a lot of those environments because they can't see very far in that sawgrass, obviously, And night vision doesn't do as well either.
[00:47:25.291 --> 00:47:29.651]   But the bottom line is, they're just rushing over that border 24 hours a day.
[00:47:29.651 --> 00:47:35.231]   And even if you block Eagle Pass, it's one speck of pepper on a giant,
[00:47:35.231 --> 00:47:38.731]  I totally agree with you and get what you're saying.
[00:47:38.731 --> 00:47:40.530]   And you're the guy that's been down there for many years and
[00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:41.850]  you're the leading expert.
[00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:43.131]  And I know we can't trust Abbott.
[00:47:43.177 --> 00:47:50.920]  What I'm saying is, 25 states joining us, that speck of pepper, people focus on that and realize that finally states are standing up.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:55.882]  I agree they're going to try to provocateur it, they're going to try to January 6 it, but we're still going to be there.
[00:47:55.902 --> 00:47:57.943]  This time we know what to look for, we're going to be exposing it.
[00:47:58.263 --> 00:48:01.884]  Regardless, why do you think Abbott was finally forced to do this?
[00:48:04.418 --> 00:48:05.941]  I think it's more kayfabe.
[00:48:06.041 --> 00:48:07.143]  I just don't trust this.
[00:48:07.244 --> 00:48:11.592]  Again, you're very smart, so I pay very close attention to what you say.
[00:48:11.912 --> 00:48:12.453]  Very close.
[00:48:12.694 --> 00:48:15.158]  People don't know what that term means.
[00:48:15.218 --> 00:48:16.260]  Explain what kayfabe means.
[00:48:17.878 --> 00:48:20.621]  Payfabe is that wrestling, that's an old wrestling term.
[00:48:21.101 --> 00:48:23.784]  I actually picked it up with Eric Weinstein using it.
[00:48:23.824 --> 00:48:26.066]  I just took his brother, Brett, down into the Derry Gap.
[00:48:26.366 --> 00:48:33.493]  But the old wrestling term that's been around for years, which is just a fake fight where the owners own both sides, right?
[00:48:33.913 --> 00:48:40.740]  And so it's fake fights that sometimes actually, you know, when I was in India, I spent a year in India, and I want to say something about this.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.342]  There's so many fakes in India.
[00:48:43.482 --> 00:48:45.884]  Like, let's say a candy bar.
[00:48:45.924 --> 00:48:49.447]  I won't say a brand, but let's say a candy bar, right?
[00:48:49.668 --> 00:48:55.633]  And so this candy bar, some people want the original and some people want the fake because it's cheaper.
[00:48:55.933 --> 00:49:00.978]  And then other people want the fake fake because it's cheaper but tastes more like the original.
[00:49:01.318 --> 00:49:04.681]  Then they'll start arguing about, no, I like the fake fake fake.
[00:49:05.081 --> 00:49:06.462]  That's like pay fade.
[00:49:06.762 --> 00:49:07.682]  You get lost.
[00:49:08.023 --> 00:49:13.666]  Or, you know, when you talk to, say, Espionage, most people can't track more than about three layers of deception, right?
[00:49:14.006 --> 00:49:18.308]  You can track, like, you know, what a spy is, and you can track what a double agent is.
[00:49:18.328 --> 00:49:29.754]  When it gets to, like, triple agent, quadruple agent... That's why we overpower it by being individuals who know we're right and taking action under a common rule of non-violence and information.
[00:49:31.243 --> 00:49:31.763]  That's right.
[00:49:31.943 --> 00:49:32.463]  That's right.
[00:49:32.543 --> 00:49:34.704]  Now, I mean, this Abbott must go.
[00:49:34.864 --> 00:49:37.065]  I mean, he is not our friend.
[00:49:37.345 --> 00:49:38.885]  Look, he just ran off to India.
[00:49:39.605 --> 00:49:41.526]  It's not a coincidence that he went to Mumbai.
[00:49:41.586 --> 00:49:53.869]  Keep in mind, Mumbai is, well, the beginning of the new Indo-European corridor, just like I-69 down there in McAllen and other places down there in Brownsville, those three feeders that then go up to Detroit.
[00:49:53.909 --> 00:49:57.690]  Keep in mind, World Economic Forum also has a big presence in Detroit.
[00:49:58.090 --> 00:49:59.411]  I mean, this is not a coincidence.
[00:49:59.451 --> 00:50:02.093]  We could deep dive into that on a different day if you have time.
[00:50:02.493 --> 00:50:05.656]  But the bottom line is a lot of this is about trade corridors.
[00:50:05.936 --> 00:50:09.078]  That's why I'm in front of the Panama Canal right now.
[00:50:09.298 --> 00:50:10.519]  You might see a ship go by.
[00:50:10.899 --> 00:50:15.303]  I mean, I'm out here looking at larger things than just these little fights.
[00:50:15.383 --> 00:50:18.085]  These little fights are like swatting mosquitoes.
[00:50:18.565 --> 00:50:22.768]  Don't get killed in Eagle Pass.
[00:50:23.028 --> 00:50:24.729]  We've got a much bigger thing going on.
[00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:26.771]  We've got a much bigger fish to fry.
[00:50:28.652 --> 00:50:30.884]  Alright, I'm asking a lot of questions, but you're the real expert here.
[00:50:30.904 --> 00:50:31.648]  What else is on your radar?
[00:50:33.513 --> 00:50:38.017]  Well, after this, I'm going to head over to, well, I've got to do a few things.
[00:50:38.117 --> 00:50:41.499]  Actually, Tucker contacted me last night about going on his show.
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:47.384]  I think a lot of that's due to you and Brett and Doc telling him that we need to talk about some of these other things.
[00:50:47.744 --> 00:50:51.788]  So, you know, whenever they're ready for that, I'm obviously ready to do it.
[00:50:52.508 --> 00:50:56.351]  And then also, I've got some things, I want to look at Taiwan and Japan, some other issues.
[00:50:56.711 --> 00:50:59.714]  So, I'll shoot over there for a while and then I'll be right back to the United States.
[00:50:59.734 --> 00:51:00.875]  So, I'm coming to Texas.
[00:51:01.555 --> 00:51:08.881]  Next week, early next week for this, and I'll come by and see you if you've got time, Alex, and then down to the border.
[00:51:09.221 --> 00:51:13.064]  Of course, I'm not going to go get swatted at Eagle Pass.
[00:51:13.405 --> 00:51:23.452]  I'll be down in that area just watching what's going on, and then I'll come back up to your area again, and then finally punch out back to Asia to look at some other China issues.
[00:51:23.733 --> 00:51:25.574]  And by the way, I'm so glad you said that.
[00:51:25.714 --> 00:51:28.977]  I already told my crew that it's going down Monday, and I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:51:28.997 --> 00:51:29.857]  I'm going to be going soon.
[00:51:30.618 --> 00:51:37.604]  I already told them, your job is to find provocateurs and operatives who will use the mask and militia and all that.
[00:51:38.325 --> 00:51:42.408]  Not the militia's bad, but to pose as that, just like we saw with the Whitmer attempted kidnapping.
[00:51:42.788 --> 00:51:49.174]  Our main mission is to document in case the feds try to set something up, and there's a lot of scenarios they could use.
[00:51:50.472 --> 00:51:53.094]  Yeah, let me tell you about one way to spot provocateurs.
[00:51:53.154 --> 00:51:55.596]  I've done this in many countries, and they have certain habits.
[00:51:55.636 --> 00:52:02.921]  And I know some of us will watch this and make countermeasures, but in reality, more of the information will get to our side than theirs.
[00:52:03.341 --> 00:52:07.864]  One of the ways to spot them is to be there long before it actually kicks off.
[00:52:08.265 --> 00:52:10.386]  That's exactly what I told my crew.
[00:52:10.666 --> 00:52:12.387]  They're like, don't we wait until the caravan gets there?
[00:52:12.408 --> 00:52:13.568]  I said, no, get in place now.
[00:52:14.249 --> 00:52:15.209]  And I said, I will relieve you.
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:17.781]  Then you know the pattern of life.
[00:52:18.061 --> 00:52:21.102]  And they'll often meet up before they go into something, right?
[00:52:21.482 --> 00:52:23.503]  Often they'll have the same pair of shoes.
[00:52:23.923 --> 00:52:29.005]  Watch for any recognition symbols, like a piece of tape on their hat or something.
[00:52:29.025 --> 00:52:30.765]  I mean, let's just say they look like a bunch of pedophiles.
[00:52:30.805 --> 00:52:32.186]  They're very easy to spot leftists.
[00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:34.930]  Yeah, and watch for antennas.
[00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:37.051]  Anybody with antennas, photograph them.
[00:52:37.372 --> 00:52:44.876]  When people are talking on their radios, like at January 6th and so many others I've been to, generally they're trying to find the guy that they're trying to talk with.
[00:52:45.237 --> 00:52:51.981]  So when they talk on their radios and they look that direction, look that direction and start photographing, because you might get their partner, right?
[00:52:52.041 --> 00:52:55.382]   And then you can dispatch one of your people to Shadow him or her, right?
[00:52:55.722 --> 00:52:59.483]  So, I mean, there's ways to counter and watch what's going on.
[00:52:59.503 --> 00:52:59.783]  Well, exactly.
[00:52:59.823 --> 00:53:05.545]  Everybody wants to fight the New World Order, but 90% of its information, this is where you really... The war is now, folks.
[00:53:05.845 --> 00:53:10.446]  This is where you go to be peaceful and watch and video and document, and that shakes them up.
[00:53:10.706 --> 00:53:14.027]  That could stop a false flag, their understanding that we're there watching.
[00:53:15.367 --> 00:53:15.747]  All right.
[00:53:15.787 --> 00:53:17.228]  And there's many other ways to spot them.
[00:53:17.248 --> 00:53:19.468]  We'll just talk about in person, but, you know... No, no, no.
[00:53:19.488 --> 00:53:19.869]  Go ahead.
[00:53:19.889 --> 00:53:20.289]  You're right.
[00:53:20.349 --> 00:53:21.489]  It's better to get it out there.
[00:53:23.015 --> 00:53:27.837]  Well, photograph everything they've got, because oftentimes you won't be able to spot it until later.
[00:53:28.097 --> 00:53:33.379]  Like, sometimes you can't spot recognition symbols until you've gone over the game tapes over and over and over.
[00:53:33.639 --> 00:53:36.000]  And let me tell you one thing when it comes to watching game tapes.
[00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:39.302]  Always get women involved in helping to watch the game tapes.
[00:53:39.322 --> 00:53:41.723]  I've been through this years and years in many countries.
[00:53:42.063 --> 00:53:44.464]  Women see stuff that we don't see, right?
[00:53:44.844 --> 00:54:10.142]   It's just every time it's like you have to have women watching the game tapes and they'll be like hey that guy's got well how did you even notice they got you know different tips on their shoelaces or something I don't know how women see this stuff they're like tigers or something but so when you're watching the videos don't just shoot the videos go back and watch them over and over and over and then you'll you might notice things watch them the next day sleep on it go back and No, you're right.
[00:54:10.162 --> 00:54:16.814]  My wife, for years, I mean when they're like 10 years, she'll instantly say, that person's bad, I don't like them, look at this, and they see the detail.
[00:54:17.535 --> 00:54:18.817]  They see the detail we don't see.
[00:54:19.997 --> 00:54:20.537]  That's right.
[00:54:20.617 --> 00:54:26.880]  They see stuff, and then often you put it together when you're looking at some other video somebody made a year ago.
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:30.121]  And she'll go, oh wait a minute, I remember I saw something in Atlanta.
[00:54:30.481 --> 00:54:32.402]  And you look that up, you're like, oh bingo, right?
[00:54:32.422 --> 00:54:38.744]  They're using the same sort of megaphone, and they've got the same, you know, hat on or something like that, and they can't undo that.
[00:54:38.804 --> 00:54:41.745]  They've already committed it to action somewhere else, right?
[00:54:42.185 --> 00:54:45.306]  In other words, they can't undo all the videos that are already out there.
[00:54:45.607 --> 00:54:53.872]   So just look at the game takes that you made, make sure you look at them with a team, But bottom line, you're saying something big is going down with this.
[00:54:54.152 --> 00:54:55.993]  This is already the giant number one story.
[00:54:56.474 --> 00:54:57.775]  It looks good on the surface.
[00:54:58.175 --> 00:55:00.878]  It could be in our advantage to wake people up and save the country.
[00:55:01.178 --> 00:55:03.300]  Or the enemy could use it all against us like January 6th.
[00:55:04.625 --> 00:55:04.845]  Right.
[00:55:04.945 --> 00:55:10.871]  And remember, the people that are taking action against you, they may be staying in hotels literally 100 miles away.
[00:55:10.931 --> 00:55:15.055]  That's a normal sort of tactic that's used 50 or 100 miles away.
[00:55:15.375 --> 00:55:18.758]  So watch when you see groups that are like 50 or 100 miles away.
[00:55:18.778 --> 00:55:22.822]  They look like a bunch of, you know, guys that, hey, something about these guys.
[00:55:23.142 --> 00:55:25.605]  You know, don't hesitate to get all that committed.
[00:55:26.045 --> 00:55:28.651]  Remember, we have face recognition now too, right?
[00:55:28.931 --> 00:55:31.697]  So, I mean, you can put these things together.
[00:55:31.777 --> 00:55:36.847]  If you get a good photo, you can put their image in a Google image search to find out who they are.
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:39.280]  That's right.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.362]  And often they will be staying like hours drive away.
[00:55:42.402 --> 00:55:44.303]  They won't be staying in any hotels near there.
[00:55:44.663 --> 00:55:46.544]  And so just, you know, pay attention.
[00:55:46.824 --> 00:55:48.245]  They'll generally show up in groups.
[00:55:48.305 --> 00:55:51.306]  They'll generally meet in advance somewhere.
[00:55:51.606 --> 00:55:58.050]  That's why often it's good to have people there days in advance watching the patterns of life and watch the perimeters.
[00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:00.111]  Watch the perimeter before the action.
[00:56:01.351 --> 00:56:06.295]  I mean, if you can, watch it at least 24 hours in advance, and then watch it afterwards.
[00:56:06.816 --> 00:56:07.656]  It's very important.
[00:56:08.257 --> 00:56:13.281]  And then walk, when it's all done, when it's said and done, when possible, walk the ground.
[00:56:13.601 --> 00:56:19.005]  Walk the ground, look and see if there's things that get left behind, especially if there's any dramas.
[00:56:19.426 --> 00:56:20.366]  Watch the ground.
[00:56:20.547 --> 00:56:21.387]  Check everything.
[00:56:21.948 --> 00:56:22.988]  Check the trash cans.
[00:56:23.068 --> 00:56:23.569]  Check it all.
[00:56:24.329 --> 00:56:25.610]  Alright, you don't like to speculate.
[00:56:25.631 --> 00:56:28.033]  You're just an intel officer that reports what you're seeing.
[00:56:28.073 --> 00:56:31.557]  But, gut level, get into the speculation here.
[00:56:32.879 --> 00:56:34.100]  You say you smell the bait.
[00:56:34.461 --> 00:56:35.522]  And it's good Texas stood up.
[00:56:35.562 --> 00:56:36.343]  It's good this is happening.
[00:56:36.363 --> 00:56:37.904]  But they've lured us into something they want.
[00:56:38.465 --> 00:56:39.026]  That's okay.
[00:56:39.046 --> 00:56:40.608]  We can use this as an opportunity against them.
[00:56:41.649 --> 00:56:42.570]  What else are you looking at?
[00:56:44.335 --> 00:56:49.518]  Well, by the way, in so far as that particular place, Eagle Pass, you can walk over the bridge.
[00:56:49.598 --> 00:56:50.998]  There's numerous bridges.
[00:56:51.239 --> 00:56:52.599]  You can go to the Mexican side.
[00:56:52.639 --> 00:56:56.962]  I stayed on that side almost two weeks, and some of that video you were showing was video I shot from that.
[00:56:57.322 --> 00:57:00.864]  You can see inside the park from that side very clearly, right?
[00:57:00.924 --> 00:57:02.344]  So, just keep that in mind.
[00:57:03.025 --> 00:57:05.046]  So, again, I spent almost two weeks on that side.
[00:57:05.406 --> 00:57:09.008]  Now, what I'm watching for is any, first of all, just video everything.
[00:57:09.068 --> 00:57:09.848]   Keep the eye I totally agree.
[00:57:09.668 --> 00:57:13.827]   video running at all times, right? For your own safety as well because we know they're doing
[00:57:13.827 --> 00:57:18.867]   setups. We know that they're up to, you know, anything, anything goes. Keep in mind, they've
[00:57:18.867 --> 00:57:23.748]   got thermals on their giraffe, you know, their telescoping poles. They can see if you've got a
[00:57:23.748 --> 00:57:27.507]   weapon, they'll see that weapon through your clothes, by the way. No, I totally agree. The
[00:57:27.507 --> 00:57:31.347]  last thing you want is a bunch of weapons. Right.
[00:57:31.484 --> 00:57:32.644]  And they can see the weapon.
[00:57:33.205 --> 00:57:34.726]  It's not x-ray, but it's thermal.
[00:57:34.766 --> 00:57:38.848]  And they can tell if you're a male or a female with those thermals.
[00:57:39.169 --> 00:57:40.850]  And those are really serious thermals.
[00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:42.070]  They're down there right now.
[00:57:42.411 --> 00:57:44.152]  People have been posting photos of them.
[00:57:44.432 --> 00:57:45.052]  Well, say it again.
[00:57:45.092 --> 00:57:47.254]  This is an info war, not a physical war.
[00:57:48.553 --> 00:57:49.154]  That's right.
[00:57:49.394 --> 00:57:50.194]  It's an info war.
[00:57:50.555 --> 00:57:55.238]  And so collect everything you've got, analyze it with your teams, and then start publishing it.
[00:57:55.599 --> 00:58:00.422]  And so that others, there may be somebody else in the other part of the country that goes, oh, wait a minute, that was key.
[00:58:00.462 --> 00:58:00.923]  That's right.
[00:58:01.143 --> 00:58:03.325]  Put everything out.
[00:58:03.725 --> 00:58:07.328]  Dominate and flood the battle space in the info war with intel.
[00:58:08.462 --> 00:58:09.002]  That's right.
[00:58:09.102 --> 00:58:09.643]  Flooded out.
[00:58:09.683 --> 00:58:18.246]  Because remember, the photos that you take there in Eagle Pass and the hotels way around there, somebody in Miami might go, hey, I go to the gym with that guy.
[00:58:18.406 --> 00:58:19.767]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:58:19.927 --> 00:58:23.909]  And then we'll identify the Southern Property Law Center ADL operative.
[00:58:25.461 --> 00:58:27.302]  Right, we just never know who they are.
[00:58:27.442 --> 00:58:34.568]  And we are, as Glenn Reynolds would have said 20 years ago, an army of Davids, right?
[00:58:34.648 --> 00:58:35.989]  We are an army of Davids.
[00:58:36.429 --> 00:58:41.933]  And we can all collect and we can all disseminate amongst ourselves and we can figure out who's who in the zoo.
[00:58:41.953 --> 00:58:45.736]  I mean, we've got a lot of the technology that they've got if you just use it.
[00:58:46.036 --> 00:58:47.578]  For instance, facial recognition.
[00:58:47.919 --> 00:58:48.560]  You can do it.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:52.044]  I mean, there's many softwares out there that are, you know, a hundred bucks.
[00:58:52.104 --> 00:58:53.426]  You know, you can do it.
[00:58:53.706 --> 00:58:58.092]  You know, uh, and that Lightroom, as an example, has, uh, Adobe Lightroom.
[00:58:58.112 --> 00:59:00.475]  Or you just post them on X and say, who is this?
[00:59:01.857 --> 00:59:02.417]  That's right.
[00:59:03.258 --> 00:59:08.863]  And as you know, you can reverse image search and face search and all those sorts of things.
[00:59:09.643 --> 00:59:10.624]  So we can do it as well.
[00:59:11.005 --> 00:59:18.070]  Interestingly, when I was in Hong Kong covering the fighting there for seven months until they kicked me out, the Hong Kongers were doing that quite a lot, actually.
[00:59:18.371 --> 00:59:28.159]  And one of the ways the Hong Kongers actually were confounding the CCP was wearing a little light-level mask with just little stickers and things on their face to change the recognition.
[00:59:29.383 --> 00:59:35.050]  Yeah, and they were wearing t-shirts with people, the people that were actually, they were looking for certain people.
[00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:41.618]  People started wearing hats and photos that had their faces on it so that they would get a lot of false hits and waste their time.
[00:59:41.978 --> 00:59:45.422]  You know, ultimately, they could still fight through that.
[00:59:45.622 --> 00:59:48.426]  Yeah, two can always play, two can play in a game.
[00:59:49.505 --> 00:59:49.925]  That's right.
[00:59:50.145 --> 00:59:53.867]  Anything you can do to waste their time is a benefit, right?
[00:59:54.387 --> 01:00:00.529]  Any little thing, any little paper cut, anything that slows them down, you know, anything that's legal stays within the law.
[01:00:00.849 --> 01:00:04.070]  We don't have to hand them everything on a silver platter, right?
[01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:07.431]  They need to know that everybody who shows up will be photographed.
[01:00:07.451 --> 01:00:07.771]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:07.791 --> 01:00:09.072]  They want a physical fight.
[01:00:09.112 --> 01:00:10.192]  That's the last thing we want.
[01:00:10.552 --> 01:00:11.233]  Michael Yamno.
[01:00:12.327 --> 01:00:16.980]  Eagle Pass, Congress, they only focus on the border being invaded, not the U.N.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:17.802]  camps being set up.
[01:00:17.862 --> 01:00:21.030]  Spend a few minutes on your main work, Darian Gap, what's happening there?
[01:00:22.472 --> 01:00:28.278]  Well, the camps that are down here and also in Mexico and Guatemala, we're putting in more camps in Guatemala.
[01:00:28.298 --> 01:00:31.221]  I say we, the United States, is putting, I think, eight, is that right?
[01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:32.842]  I mean, I was just up there recently.
[01:00:33.323 --> 01:00:36.606]  And then also in Texas, there's camps being built in Texas.
[01:00:37.407 --> 01:00:41.391]  I mean, lots of camps being built in Texas or across, let's say, the southern border, right?
[01:00:41.891 --> 01:00:44.354]  And what are these camps going to be for, ultimately?
[01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:45.435]  I don't know.
[01:00:45.455 --> 01:00:50.577]  I mean, is it just for the aliens who are invading, or ultimately is that for us as well?
[01:00:50.958 --> 01:00:58.581]  I mean, a lot of people look at the border wall and they're like, hey, this is a perfect way to keep us in, because it's obviously not keeping them out, right?
[01:00:58.961 --> 01:01:00.261]  It's not keeping anybody out.
[01:01:00.962 --> 01:01:03.583]  In fact, the invasion is increasing as we speak.
[01:01:03.983 --> 01:01:10.285]  As Governor Abbott is off in India running around to his money guru, his state is wide open, right?
[01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:13.927]  I mean, there's nobody stopping the border invasion at this point.
[01:01:16.883 --> 01:01:17.824]  Spend more time on that.
[01:01:19.645 --> 01:01:20.586]  It's just increasing.
[01:01:20.626 --> 01:01:28.073]  Like, for instance, down here in the Daring Gap, I just had, again, Brett Weinstein down and Dr. Chris Martinson, who was just on your show.
[01:01:28.573 --> 01:01:31.515]  They're both doing incredible analysis of what they've seen down here.
[01:01:31.776 --> 01:01:41.504]  That's why it's really beneficial to get other people, even though I do this a lot, as soon as I bring somebody else down, they always see stuff that I have missed the whole time that I'm here.
[01:01:41.884 --> 01:01:47.409]  Because they're seeing it from another set of eyes that has other sets of information that are not in my head, right?
[01:01:47.729 --> 01:01:51.773]  And so that's why I desperately want you to come down, because I want you to see this as well.
[01:01:52.093 --> 01:01:53.634]  These camps are growing down here.
[01:01:53.895 --> 01:01:55.536]  The flow is increasing down here.
[01:01:55.876 --> 01:02:00.480]  This place where I'm at now is called the City of Knowledge in Panama City.
[01:02:00.781 --> 01:02:10.574]   This is where more than five dozen of the NGOs, IGOs, And non-profits are at, like IOM, HIAS, and all these other... And you explained that yesterday.
[01:02:10.634 --> 01:02:11.936]  Those are, it's a former U.S.
[01:02:11.956 --> 01:02:14.821]  military base now turned into a giant U.N.
[01:02:14.961 --> 01:02:16.043]  NGO invasion base.
[01:02:17.403 --> 01:02:17.903]  That's right.
[01:02:18.264 --> 01:02:21.986]  For instance, HIAS, they've got an office right like five minutes walk from me now.
[01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:26.369]  There were allegations yesterday that Ben Shapiro is a donor to HIAS.
[01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:27.550]  I don't know if these are true.
[01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:29.671]  He needs to be put on the spot and asked.
[01:02:29.752 --> 01:02:31.433]  And if it's not true, he can deny it.
[01:02:31.813 --> 01:02:35.095]  And if it is, if he doesn't deny it, then I mean, he's going to end up owning it.
[01:02:35.496 --> 01:02:42.259]   But HIAS, the Hebrew immigrant ADA Society is one of the main engines of the invasion, right?
[01:02:42.619 --> 01:02:44.900]  And they've got an office like five minutes walk from me.
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.481]  They've also got an office down in Darien Province.
[01:02:47.921 --> 01:02:54.383]  It's a built, it's a home I almost rented because it's right next to China Camp, but they rented it before I could get it.
[01:02:54.744 --> 01:02:58.885]  So HIAS actually has an office right next to China Camp.
[01:02:58.925 --> 01:03:00.486]  They call it San Vicente Camp here.
[01:03:00.806 --> 01:03:09.371]   But remember, Mayorkas used to be a board member, Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas, Used to be a board member on HIAS, right?
[01:03:09.491 --> 01:03:11.853]  And HIAS is right next to the China camp.
[01:03:12.694 --> 01:03:15.356]  He came down on April 18, 2022.
[01:03:15.877 --> 01:03:16.497]  I was there.
[01:03:16.517 --> 01:03:17.198]  I was waiting for him.
[01:03:17.438 --> 01:03:19.900]  In fact, I left there and I went to Eagle Pass, right?
[01:03:20.181 --> 01:03:26.186]  I went to, I went to, so anyway, so he came down on April 18, 2022 and promised to put more money into that camp.
[01:03:29.469 --> 01:03:37.357]  San Vicente Camp, China Camp, right next to HIAS, where he used to be a board member, and now that camp is much larger and much more efficient.
[01:03:37.658 --> 01:03:57.256]   That's the camp that most of the Chinese are using when they're invading through the South American corridor, which most of the Chinese, a huge number of, I don't know, we're actually, we know some of the Chinese now are actually taking boats, or according to what they just recently told us, They're taking boats from Mexico to Canada and coming across the Canadian border, right?
[01:03:57.576 --> 01:04:00.838]  So, I mean, we know a lot of Chinese are coming across the Canadian border.
[01:04:01.098 --> 01:04:08.023]  We know they're coming across California, of course, and Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, of course, and Florida.
[01:04:08.043 --> 01:04:11.285]  They're coming up on the beaches of Florida, and they're flying in every day.
[01:04:11.605 --> 01:04:15.227]  As you know, people ask all the time, well, why don't they just fly in?
[01:04:15.407 --> 01:04:17.008]  They do, every single day.
[01:04:17.168 --> 01:04:17.768]  Absolutely.
[01:04:17.889 --> 01:04:19.870]  All right, Michael Young, you are on fire.
[01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:21.471]  Can't wait for you to get back to Texas.
[01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:23.611]  Very soon, we're going to be down at the border.
[01:04:23.691 --> 01:04:24.412]  Join us there.
[01:04:24.872 --> 01:04:26.212]  Thank you so much for your time.
[01:04:26.712 --> 01:04:30.293]  At Michael underscore Yon on X. MichaelYon.com.
[01:04:30.313 --> 01:04:32.634]  That's MichaelYon.com.
[01:04:33.114 --> 01:04:34.534]  MichaelYon.locals.com.
[01:04:34.994 --> 01:04:35.815]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:35.855 --> 01:04:36.675]  You're absolutely right.
[01:04:37.195 --> 01:04:42.976]   That's why M4s has got to get down to the border because the left's going to try to create Some type of false flag, some type of big event.
[01:04:42.996 --> 01:04:47.077]  They're going to try to have infiltrated militias that, you know, abuse migrants or something.
[01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:48.898]  I mean, you can see the pre-programming.
[01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:51.618]  The Washington Post says civil war is about to break out.
[01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:53.999]  No, we're not at war with our government.
[01:04:54.019 --> 01:04:55.919]  We're trying to remove the criminals in our government.
[01:04:56.219 --> 01:04:58.139]  This is a very important time to be alive.
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:04:59.480]  Thank you so much, Michael Young.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.360]  Can I say one more thing?
[01:05:03.481 --> 01:05:04.061]  Oh, thank you.
[01:05:04.121 --> 01:05:04.541]  I'm sorry.
[01:05:05.721 --> 01:05:06.161]  Ten minutes.
[01:05:06.201 --> 01:05:06.661]  Go, go.
[01:05:07.621 --> 01:05:08.001]  OK.
[01:05:08.762 --> 01:05:09.122]  OK.
[01:05:09.162 --> 01:05:09.682]  About women.
[01:05:11.224 --> 01:05:15.230]  I'm starting to see a lot of women rise up, more so than men, right?
[01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:27.627]  And interestingly, one of the big indicators that the Iraq War was starting to turn information-wise in our favor in 2006 and 2007, is I noticed that the women were starting to give us much more information, right?
[01:05:28.207 --> 01:05:34.532]  Women, when you see that tide turn with women, it's coming in our favor, right?
[01:05:35.353 --> 01:05:41.157]  And I see a lot, like for instance, the people that will go to the border in the Darien Gap, it's more women than men.
[01:05:41.297 --> 01:05:43.639]  Women are like, let's go, let's go to the Darien Gap.
[01:05:43.859 --> 01:05:45.721]  So I'm taking a lot down here.
[01:05:46.441 --> 01:05:49.804]  And they do spot stuff we never see, period.
[01:05:50.704 --> 01:06:01.371]   And so, whether it's Philippines, whether it's Iraq or wherever, when the women start to turn, That is a good sign for us when they're turning on our side, right?
[01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:08.713]  You know, you see, I think that the pool of Karen's seems to be drying up, and the pool of Patriot women is rising up.
[01:06:08.733 --> 01:06:16.875]  That's right, women instinctively are all about survival, and they're able to manipulate women to join tyranny for survival, but when women realize it's a fraud, they join humanity.
[01:06:17.455 --> 01:06:19.536]  So, Hitler said that, he was a bad guy, and he was right.
[01:06:20.396 --> 01:06:21.176]  Oh, did he say that?
[01:06:21.396 --> 01:06:24.677]  He said, first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[01:06:26.172 --> 01:06:26.852]  Oh, interesting.
[01:06:26.932 --> 01:06:28.113]  I didn't know he said that.
[01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:29.434]  But I mean, it's clearly true.
[01:06:29.794 --> 01:06:32.775]  I've seen it just from my experience in Thailand and Hong Kong.
[01:06:32.895 --> 01:06:36.717]  First you get the women, then you got the children, so follow the men.
[01:06:36.757 --> 01:06:39.798]  That's why the left targets women, but women have now figured out it's a fraud.
[01:06:39.818 --> 01:06:40.639]  I know what you're saying.
[01:06:40.679 --> 01:06:41.199]  More and more are.
[01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:47.154]  Yeah, and so, when you go and do this thing in Texas, make sure you bring women.
[01:06:47.214 --> 01:06:48.175]  You don't have to bring women.
[01:06:48.195 --> 01:06:49.216]  They're probably bringing you.
[01:06:49.236 --> 01:06:50.276]  I mean, you know what I'm saying?
[01:06:50.617 --> 01:06:54.520]  Look at Ann VanderSteel and Masako Kanaha and so many others.
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:56.201]  The women just parachuting in.
[01:06:56.241 --> 01:06:57.042]  They're ready to go.
[01:06:57.682 --> 01:06:59.063]  And, I mean, just do it.
[01:07:00.244 --> 01:07:04.808]  And stand up, gather everything, all the information you can, and distribute it widely.
[01:07:05.828 --> 01:07:06.289]  Absolutely.
[01:07:06.369 --> 01:07:09.935]  But even if it's being manipulated, we can't take away the state stood up for Texas.
[01:07:10.316 --> 01:07:11.238]  There's a big awakening.
[01:07:11.258 --> 01:07:12.680]  They're going to try to hijack and control it.
[01:07:12.961 --> 01:07:14.463]  But it's very, very positive overall.
[01:07:14.804 --> 01:07:15.846]  Mike Leon, thank you so much.
[01:07:15.866 --> 01:07:16.407]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.160]  I'm with you, sir.
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:18.821]  I'll see you soon.
[01:07:18.861 --> 01:07:19.421]  With you too, sir.
[01:07:19.461 --> 01:07:19.941]  God bless you.
[01:07:20.361 --> 01:07:20.581]  All right.
[01:07:20.601 --> 01:07:35.048]  We're going to play a couple of clips here, and I'm going to come back and take your questions or comments or statements on X Spaces, which nobody else on syndicated talk radio slash TV is integrated Xs.
[01:07:35.108 --> 01:07:35.828]  I'm proud of the crew.
[01:07:35.868 --> 01:07:36.809]  I'm proud of Chase Geyser.
[01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:42.171]  Weeks ago, he said, why don't we put Xs on the air?
[01:07:42.951 --> 01:07:44.032]  So we're not just taking calls.
[01:07:46.087 --> 01:07:49.030]  From a traditional phone line, which we do still do, and it's great.
[01:07:49.431 --> 01:07:50.632]  It's all about you having a voice.
[01:07:50.652 --> 01:07:54.416]  We also have people on X right now that have their own followings.
[01:07:54.436 --> 01:07:56.999]  They're pushing in to listen right now at Real Alex Jones.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.002]  And so we're going to go to a quick couple of clips.
[01:07:59.362 --> 01:08:01.725]  We're going to come right back with your phone calls.
[01:08:01.805 --> 01:08:05.409]  It's all about innovation and not becoming a fossil.
[01:08:10.373 --> 01:08:15.096]  Two years ago, we began developing this game that came out so much better than I even thought it would.
[01:08:15.116 --> 01:08:16.377]  It is now a number one hit.
[01:08:16.818 --> 01:08:20.280]  I imagined the control freak left attacking it.
[01:08:20.801 --> 01:08:33.850]  But I didn't know that right when the game came out, with perfect timing, Elon Musk would release me on X. And the whole world will be waking up, and the Davos Group will be confronted at their own events by world leaders calling out their tyranny.
[01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:35.691]  This is the planets aligning.
[01:08:36.071 --> 01:08:42.876]  And now, MSNBC, the corporate press, Media Matters, George Soros, they're all calling for it to be banned.
[01:08:43.136 --> 01:08:52.162]  Is there a way to counter the types of hate that people like Alex Jones promote and now they do in video games?
[01:08:52.222 --> 01:08:57.666]  I mean, this is a party that talks about video games being dangerous for our kids.
[01:08:57.926 --> 01:09:02.169]  And yet here he is with a video game that promotes violence.
[01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:03.610]  You will be silenced.
[01:09:05.093 --> 01:09:07.198]  And celebrates that kind of violence.
[01:09:08.467 --> 01:09:10.667]  You suck, big tech lizard nerd!
[01:09:10.907 --> 01:09:19.069]  Because, let's be honest here, when he is talking about killing globalists, we know what globalists now means for the Republican Party and what that is code for.
[01:09:19.409 --> 01:09:24.890]  Because they understand they're reaching a bunch of young guys who are getting this sort of message beaten into them right now.
[01:09:25.190 --> 01:09:27.951]  Today, I'm playing the Unhinged Alex Jones video game.
[01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:32.072]  I saw it was released on Steam, so I'm like, well, that kind of opens the floodgates.
[01:09:32.312 --> 01:09:33.772]  This game is actually really good fun.
[01:09:34.412 --> 01:09:36.873]  This is insane!
[01:09:36.993 --> 01:09:40.254]  Look at all the blood!
[01:09:40.314 --> 01:09:43.395]  Look at all these zombies!
[01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:44.435]  Okay.
[01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:45.436]  I'll eat your ass!
[01:09:45.916 --> 01:09:47.136]  Okay, so that is what he said.
[01:09:48.437 --> 01:09:49.417]  I'll eat your ass!
[01:09:49.437 --> 01:09:55.879]  I don't know what the characteristics of the game are beyond that he's involved and that it's killing globalists.
[01:09:56.359 --> 01:10:03.482]   This is the kind of thing that will become a normalization lever In teaching people, I mean, it's okay to kill.
[01:10:03.722 --> 01:10:05.563]  It's okay to kill the globalists.
[01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:06.624]  This is pretty amazing.
[01:10:08.585 --> 01:10:10.726]  Jump around, jump around.
[01:10:10.766 --> 01:10:14.547]  Alex Jones, you are a hero!
[01:10:14.567 --> 01:10:17.969]  This is supposed to be Justin Trudeau, I think.
[01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:20.090]  Come on, Mark!
[01:10:21.571 --> 01:10:21.931]  Oh, s***!
[01:10:22.711 --> 01:10:24.272]  Mark Zuckerberg, kill me!
[01:10:24.292 --> 01:10:25.392]  Look at him crawling away!
[01:10:25.953 --> 01:10:26.233]  Wait!
[01:10:27.453 --> 01:10:28.254]  What them dogs gonna do?
[01:10:28.274 --> 01:10:28.514]  They gonna...
[01:10:30.141 --> 01:10:31.340]  Oh, they ate his ass.
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:34.541]  Find out what they're scared of at alexjonesgame.com.
[01:10:34.541 --> 01:10:37.940]   Follow the link from there to Steam and download it and share it.
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:41.141]  It's 1776. It funds the info war.
[01:10:41.141 --> 01:10:42.942]  It is key in the culture war.
[01:10:42.942 --> 01:10:49.840]   We need to be engaged and involved in books and films and universities and Hollywood and everywhere.
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.141]  And we are.
[01:10:51.359 --> 01:10:55.961]  So get Alex Jones' New World Order Wars right now before they ban it.
[01:10:56.261 --> 01:11:00.803]  Make it such a big hit, they continue to s*** their f***ing pants.
[01:11:01.103 --> 01:11:05.205]  And all the control freaks, I want to echo what Elon Musk said to your censorship.
[01:11:05.505 --> 01:11:07.146]  Go f*** yourselves!
[01:11:09.013 --> 01:11:11.214]  So you want somebody to stand up against the globalists?
[01:11:11.234 --> 01:11:12.595]  You want somebody to fight the new world order?
[01:11:13.155 --> 01:11:15.016]  Well, if you're looking for that, I'm your man.
[01:11:15.596 --> 01:11:17.137]  I want to thank you all for your previous support.
[01:11:17.177 --> 01:11:22.680]  I want to thank you all for making The Great Reset and War for the World a number one national bestseller.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.361]  It's had a huge effect.
[01:11:25.141 --> 01:11:25.722]  We've topped it.
[01:11:26.422 --> 01:11:28.063]  This new book has just come out.
[01:11:28.423 --> 01:11:31.505]  It's available at Infowarsstore.com, signed or unsigned.
[01:11:32.535 --> 01:11:33.396]  It is incredible.
[01:11:33.696 --> 01:11:38.079]  It goes through the entire globalist master plan, their activities, what makes them tick.
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:41.561]  And then we lay out an alternate plan for humanity.
[01:11:42.062 --> 01:11:45.344]  And unlike the globalists, we're not ordering people to follow our plan.
[01:11:45.644 --> 01:11:49.087]  We're simply giving alternatives to the dystopia they're building.
[01:11:49.347 --> 01:11:56.112]  That's why it's the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[01:11:56.852 --> 01:12:09.400]  What they're selling, owning nothing, having nothing, eating bugs, castrating our children, cutting our daughters' breasts off, World War III with Russia, human smuggling, open borders, drag queen pedophile time.
[01:12:09.841 --> 01:12:16.925]  What they're selling is so unpopular, we've got to oppose what they're doing, but also give an alternate plan.
[01:12:17.306 --> 01:12:19.787]  And that's what this book opens the debate about.
[01:12:20.227 --> 01:12:23.289]  It is powerful, it is riveting, it is informative.
[01:12:24.130 --> 01:12:27.591]  I poured my heart out, and the book is a lot thicker than my last book.
[01:12:27.971 --> 01:12:30.532]  It is quite the read, but it's a fast read.
[01:12:31.092 --> 01:12:32.513]  It's an informative read.
[01:12:33.033 --> 01:12:34.973]  It is a blueprint for victory against the Globalists.
[01:12:34.993 --> 01:12:44.096]  So get your copy of The Great Awakening, The Plan to Defeat the Globalists, and Launch the Next Great Renaissance at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:12:44.457 --> 01:12:45.357]  You can get it at Amazon.
[01:12:45.377 --> 01:12:45.777]  That's great.
[01:12:45.797 --> 01:12:51.859]  We want to push number one again, but we get a lot more support when you actually buy the book from InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:12:52.419 --> 01:12:55.242]  Or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:12:56.003 --> 01:12:56.824]  We're fighting hard.
[01:12:56.844 --> 01:13:07.555]  I want to thank you for your past support, and I want to encourage you now to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get your copy, signed or unsigned, of The Great Awakening, because The Great Awakening is happening now!
[01:13:08.203 --> 01:13:10.906]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[01:13:11.046 --> 01:13:11.847]  How did this happen?
[01:13:12.508 --> 01:13:13.269]  Who's to blame?
[01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:16.914]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:18.896]  They will be held accountable.
[01:13:19.236 --> 01:13:24.763]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[01:13:25.891 --> 01:13:27.292]  I know why you did it.
[01:13:27.872 --> 01:13:30.114]  I know you were afraid, couldn't be.
[01:13:31.134 --> 01:13:32.675]  War, terror, disease.
[01:13:33.296 --> 01:13:39.139]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rock you of your common sense.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:48.065]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[01:13:48.585 --> 01:14:01.156]   But if you see what I see, If you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, together we shall give them a 5th of November that shall never, ever be fought.
[01:14:01.577 --> 01:14:07.657]   While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:14:07.657 --> 01:14:15.496]  We have the momentum.
[01:14:15.663 --> 01:14:16.865]  We have right on our side.
[01:14:16.905 --> 01:14:17.987]  We have God on our side.
[01:14:18.007 --> 01:14:19.589]  And we will win.
[01:14:20.251 --> 01:14:21.432]  It is Saturday, January 27, 2024.
[01:14:21.353 --> 01:14:31.972]   27, 2024. It's 1 14 central p.m. Texas time and we are simulcasting this TV/
[01:14:31.972 --> 01:14:37.353]  radio news show on X Spaces.
[01:14:35.425 --> 01:14:39.048]  I know Elon wants to get it to video, that's great, but we're doing it right now.
[01:14:39.068 --> 01:14:42.531]  Everybody watching on X at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:14:43.192 --> 01:14:48.857]  What a historic time to be alive, real analysis, real in-depth breakdown of what's happening.
[01:14:48.977 --> 01:14:51.480]  Alright, so we're talking about the fraudulent ruling against Trump.
[01:14:52.373 --> 01:14:56.853]   and how dangerous that is, weaponized judiciary. We're also talking about the open border and the
[01:14:56.853 --> 01:15:01.653]   danger of false flags. We're talking about it all. And so the great Chase Geiser, fellow InfoWars
[01:15:01.653 --> 01:15:08.292]   talk show host, is in there captaining the spaces. He has to control it off of his device. We're still
[01:15:08.292 --> 01:15:13.092]   busy integrating it into our own systems. We are pioneering this right now. And so it takes a few
[01:15:13.092 --> 01:15:15.974]  seconds for people on spaces to be heard.
[01:15:16.099 --> 01:15:19.182]  So I'm going to kind of let him be the traffic cop of that.
[01:15:19.242 --> 01:15:23.866]  But Chase Geiser, we've been live for now an hour and 15 minutes.
[01:15:24.367 --> 01:15:28.367]   What do you think of this maiden voyage for spaces simulcast with InfoWars?
[01:15:28.367 --> 01:15:38.606]  And again, we got a few bugs to work out.
[01:15:38.773 --> 01:15:39.934]  Just turn his microphone on.
[01:15:40.274 --> 01:15:41.694]  We're not talking to Chase on spaces.
[01:15:43.094 --> 01:15:44.714]  Just turn his microphone on in the studio.
[01:15:45.175 --> 01:15:45.475]  No, it's great.
[01:15:45.495 --> 01:15:46.655]  We've got to work the crew through all this.
[01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:46.875]  It's fine.
[01:15:46.895 --> 01:15:47.675]  We're going to work through it all.
[01:15:48.135 --> 01:15:48.455]  Go ahead.
[01:15:48.915 --> 01:15:53.236]  We've got a lot of people who are requesting to speak in the space, and I think we're ready to go.
[01:15:53.256 --> 01:15:56.417]  Let's go ahead and just give the ball to Matt Baker and hear what he has to say.
[01:15:56.597 --> 01:15:57.097]  Go ahead, Matt.
[01:15:57.477 --> 01:15:58.017]  All right.
[01:15:58.137 --> 01:16:00.837]  Author, former Navy SEAL, Matt Baker.
[01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:02.038]  No, no, that's another Matt Baker.
[01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:03.358]  Go ahead.
[01:16:05.357 --> 01:16:06.738]  Yeah, it's one of those Matt Bakers.
[01:16:06.758 --> 01:16:07.418]  We're all the same.
[01:16:07.618 --> 01:16:12.001]  Alex is dominating the Info Wars crew.
[01:16:12.021 --> 01:16:15.682]  He's dominating spaces here on X and it is amazing.
[01:16:15.702 --> 01:16:17.263]  Yeah, so this is the great Matt Baker.
[01:16:17.383 --> 01:16:18.864]  It's Matt Bracken I was thinking of.
[01:16:19.084 --> 01:16:21.185]  This is Matt Baker from San Diego, buddy.
[01:16:21.225 --> 01:16:21.665]  How you doing?
[01:16:23.026 --> 01:16:24.147]  I'm doing great, man.
[01:16:24.187 --> 01:16:27.148]  You know, somebody should give you a reward for all the work you're doing.
[01:16:28.449 --> 01:16:30.650]  Well, the reward is not being a slave.
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.221]  Yeah, I'm just kidding.
[01:16:33.921 --> 01:16:35.942]  I'm going to be going down to San Ysidro.
[01:16:35.962 --> 01:16:37.403]  It's here in San Diego.
[01:16:37.803 --> 01:16:38.623]  And it's going to be there.
[01:16:38.643 --> 01:16:40.124]  I'm going to be part of that convoy thing.
[01:16:40.624 --> 01:16:43.726]  And yes, of course, we're not going into Mexico.
[01:16:43.806 --> 01:16:45.127]  We're not going to attack Mexico.
[01:16:45.147 --> 01:16:46.187]  We're not going to attack the border.
[01:16:46.728 --> 01:17:02.236]   This is right now is our chance to shine the light, to magnify, to force multiply the optics, which are focusing finally on this bloody sword that's been festering, We're sick, guys.
[01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:03.378]  There's a problem.
[01:17:03.838 --> 01:17:13.989]  I gotta tell you, I think the main thing we have to get out of this is we have to stop the asylum process or limit it to an absolute trickle.
[01:17:14.309 --> 01:17:16.512]  This asylum thing is totally out of control.
[01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:27.521]  All these people have to do is say they fear for something in their country and it's in the Charter that they have to have the ability to work, they have to have housing, they have to have health care.
[01:17:27.621 --> 01:17:29.763]  All this stuff is written into the UN Charter.
[01:17:29.783 --> 01:17:34.225]   I looked it up last night because people always say Oh, well why did they stop in the first country?
[01:17:34.245 --> 01:17:34.846]  They're supposed to.
[01:17:34.946 --> 01:17:37.806]  If you look up this charter, the actual law, no, they don't.
[01:17:38.146 --> 01:17:39.286]  They can go wherever they want.
[01:17:39.607 --> 01:17:41.247]  And of course it's going to be here in America.
[01:17:41.287 --> 01:17:42.307]  That's where they're going to end up.
[01:17:42.587 --> 01:17:47.028]  We have to stop this asylum now.
[01:17:47.328 --> 01:17:50.249]  And anybody who wants to see me down in San Ysidro, please come and see me.
[01:17:50.269 --> 01:17:51.029]  I will be there.
[01:17:51.309 --> 01:17:55.250]  If you want to know, hit me up on xslave__2__liberty.
[01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:56.230]  Alex, I love you.
[01:17:56.350 --> 01:17:56.950]  I'll hand it off.
[01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:58.251]  We love you too, buddy.
[01:17:58.351 --> 01:17:58.852]  Matt Baker.
[01:17:58.892 --> 01:17:59.793]  I know Matt Baker well.
[01:17:59.813 --> 01:18:00.834]  I was thinking of Matt Braggin.
[01:18:01.975 --> 01:18:03.657]  Let's go to Liz Churchill next.
[01:18:03.677 --> 01:18:04.558]  Go ahead, Liz Churchill.
[01:18:07.389 --> 01:18:08.670]  Hey guys, how are you?
[01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:10.612]  Good, thanks for joining us.
[01:18:11.032 --> 01:18:12.974]  It's your Canadian commander calling in.
[01:18:14.675 --> 01:18:30.448]  I just want to extend on what Michael Yon had previously stated in regards to women standing up in the moment and that's exactly what's happening here because we're really suffering from a loss of testosterone.
[01:18:31.188 --> 01:18:43.780]   And I also want to add that When you speak of President Trump, I think it's important to highlight a group called Indivisible, because your country has been hijacked by a group of Marxist lawyers.
[01:18:44.521 --> 01:18:47.542]  And that's the lawfare that you're seeing right now.
[01:18:48.342 --> 01:18:53.024]  And you can extend on that if you'd like, and I'll just step out for now.
[01:18:53.304 --> 01:18:55.085]  Well, thank you so much, Liz Churchill.
[01:18:55.245 --> 01:19:00.948]  Chase Geiser, your take on the weaponization of judiciary, the lawfare?
[01:19:00.968 --> 01:19:03.449]  I mean, it's out in the open now, and it's got to be stopped.
[01:19:04.944 --> 01:19:05.484]  Absolutely.
[01:19:05.505 --> 01:19:11.909]  It's just so obvious that the left is using the judicial system as lawfare.
[01:19:11.929 --> 01:19:13.590]  And it doesn't even matter if you're guilty or not.
[01:19:13.650 --> 01:19:17.013]  The whole purpose is just to harass you with the various lawsuits.
[01:19:17.373 --> 01:19:21.796]  And we see it extending beyond the judicial system into things like letters from the IRS.
[01:19:21.856 --> 01:19:23.838]  I know Owen Schroer has received letters from the IRS.
[01:19:23.958 --> 01:19:29.101]  I've received letters from the IRS saying that I owe them over $100,000 in money that I know I don't owe them.
[01:19:29.141 --> 01:19:32.604]  And this goes all the way back to what Eric Holder was doing under the Obama administration.
[01:19:32.924 --> 01:19:37.293]  Where they just want to harass people who are political opponents or political dissidents and it's only going to get worse.
[01:19:37.333 --> 01:19:41.662]  To intimidate people, but people should be more intimidated by if they win what's going to happen.
[01:19:42.819 --> 01:19:43.520]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:48.644]  And frankly, what I'm most concerned about is how are we going to act when we win?
[01:19:48.824 --> 01:19:53.488]  Because I do think there's going to be a reckoning in this country for all the injustices that patriots have faced.
[01:19:54.049 --> 01:20:04.338]  And I hope that we maintain our integrity and our character when we finally do take all the power back, because it's going to be very tempting for us to exact a vengeance the likeness of which has never been seen.
[01:20:04.358 --> 01:20:05.439]  I agree.
[01:20:05.459 --> 01:20:06.660]  Who's up next on Spaces?
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:08.841]  Let's do Timothy Lassley next.
[01:20:09.601 --> 01:20:11.601]  Timothy, welcome.
[01:20:11.601 --> 01:20:17.360]  Let's try Derek Brose next.
[01:20:17.055 --> 01:20:18.816]  All right, Derek Brose.
[01:20:18.836 --> 01:20:19.876]  We're going to go to Derek Brose.
[01:20:19.916 --> 01:20:20.517]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:20:20.557 --> 01:20:21.938]  Thanks for being part of this.
[01:20:23.378 --> 01:20:24.679]  Hey, Alex, I appreciate you.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:28.201]  I'll just let you know very quickly based on what I'm going to say.
[01:20:28.221 --> 01:20:31.323]  I ran strategy for Windows at Microsoft.
[01:20:31.443 --> 01:20:32.484]  I was an executive there.
[01:20:32.524 --> 01:20:34.465]  I was vice president of Paramount Pictures.
[01:20:35.085 --> 01:20:37.507]  And so as a strategist, I'm looking at what's taking place.
[01:20:37.547 --> 01:20:42.710]  When you said earlier that you wouldn't trust Abbott as far as you can throw him.
[01:20:42.730 --> 01:20:44.931]  Let me just say as a strategist, I look at these things.
[01:20:45.675 --> 01:20:56.224]  And I look at if you wanted to secretly distribute an army through a country without knowing, you would use somebody as kind of a paid opposition.
[01:20:56.625 --> 01:21:01.109]  Abbott is sending people all over to strategic places.
[01:21:01.589 --> 01:21:03.691]  Isn't that a little suspect?
[01:21:03.851 --> 01:21:08.375]  And it's under the guise of opposition.
[01:21:08.951 --> 01:21:09.171]  Right.
[01:21:09.251 --> 01:21:10.772]  So we all accept it.
[01:21:10.912 --> 01:21:12.453]  There's something else going on there.
[01:21:12.633 --> 01:21:13.993]  It gives me great concern.
[01:21:14.754 --> 01:21:19.896]  And as a strategist, I look at that and say, hmm, I'm on and by the way, I live in Mexico.
[01:21:20.356 --> 01:21:23.337]  I'm literally 200 yards from the wall in Mexico.
[01:21:23.958 --> 01:21:25.618]  So I see things from this side.
[01:21:25.658 --> 01:21:38.224]  I talk to the locals and I'll tell you what the military here, I've spoken to the Mexican military and they told me that they've been training to defend that wall for an influx of Americans trying to get out.
[01:21:40.899 --> 01:21:43.122]  Well, that's what Ron Paul warned decades ago.
[01:21:43.182 --> 01:21:44.704]  The wall will be used to control us.
[01:21:44.764 --> 01:21:46.827]  But it's good the states are standing up.
[01:21:46.867 --> 01:21:48.048]  It's good to have solidarity.
[01:21:48.088 --> 01:21:48.769]  This is tyranny.
[01:21:48.809 --> 01:21:50.351]  But at the same time, you're right.
[01:21:50.371 --> 01:21:51.152]  We've got a war game.
[01:21:51.433 --> 01:21:52.934]  How they're going to try to use this against us.
[01:21:53.335 --> 01:21:54.617]  And of course, we can't trust Abbott.
[01:21:54.637 --> 01:21:56.199]  What do you think, then, should be done?
[01:21:57.714 --> 01:22:01.877]  You know, this is the thing is that all eyes need to be wide open, right?
[01:22:01.977 --> 01:22:13.225]  So the whole point is, is yes, everybody that is going to Texas and, you know, what is it, 25, 26 states now that have dedicated their National Guard to in defense of the Texas border.
[01:22:13.625 --> 01:22:17.768]  And it's really not see people keep talking about civil war, but this isn't civil war.
[01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:21.131]  The Biden administration, these people would love a civil war.
[01:22:21.451 --> 01:22:30.739]  Because that would prevent, if they could convince people to start killing each other, then they would prevent the revolutionary war that they're terrified of.
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.481]  So that's the big problem.
[01:22:32.621 --> 01:22:35.503]  And let's look at this.
[01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:37.926]  It is not an accident, okay?
[01:22:37.986 --> 01:22:40.107]  Symbolism is everything to these snakes.
[01:22:40.988 --> 01:22:46.413]  It is not an accident that this is happening at Eagle's Pass, the passing of the eagle.
[01:22:47.225 --> 01:22:47.425]  Right?
[01:22:47.305 --> 01:22:49.305]  This is crazy stuff here.
[01:22:49.305 --> 01:22:59.345]   And that goes into Roman ideology, not just the death of an eagle, but the transference of the symbol of the Roman legion,
[01:22:59.345 --> 01:23:06.305]   or the logo of the, what's the term I'm looking for that they call the Roman eagles, the standard.
[01:23:06.305 --> 01:23:08.305]  Yeah, the standard.
[01:23:08.429 --> 01:23:09.490]  Yep, it was the standard.
[01:23:09.970 --> 01:23:11.031]  And look for other things.
[01:23:11.071 --> 01:23:13.412]  Look, you've got Arizona and Texas on this border.
[01:23:13.832 --> 01:23:17.554]  Expect this border to be the ignition of whatever they're doing.
[01:23:17.574 --> 01:23:18.955]  You've got the Phoenix, right?
[01:23:19.455 --> 01:23:20.315]  Phoenix, Arizona.
[01:23:20.615 --> 01:23:23.937]  So expect both of these places to be a trigger point.
[01:23:24.357 --> 01:23:27.419]  Symbolism is everything to Luciferians.
[01:23:27.979 --> 01:23:28.479]  Everything.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.080]  You're absolutely right.
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:32.001]  Any other great points?
[01:23:34.372 --> 01:23:42.777]  You know, I would just say that people, you know, look out for the... Do not discount these basic symbolic measures, man.
[01:23:42.838 --> 01:23:44.959]  These people are going through this methodically.
[01:23:44.999 --> 01:23:50.082]  And also, look, I'm also a strict follower of Christ and Christ's words, but I'll tell you this much.
[01:23:50.502 --> 01:23:53.304]  Scripture is also scripture.
[01:23:53.444 --> 01:23:54.545]  It's a script.
[01:23:54.565 --> 01:24:00.189]  Remember who wrote it, who organized it, and who organized it in 325 CE for the Roman Empire.
[01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:02.030]  So just be cognizant of that stuff, folks.
[01:24:02.924 --> 01:24:03.945]  All right, great points.
[01:24:04.085 --> 01:24:08.147]  We're going to go back to more people joining us via xSpaces.
[01:24:08.347 --> 01:24:10.448]  You want to add anything else, Chase Geiser?
[01:24:11.709 --> 01:24:12.730]  I think it all sounds good.
[01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:15.892]  I think we should be able to take Timothy Lassley's comments.
[01:24:17.272 --> 01:24:18.533]  Timothy, you're on the air.
[01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:19.033]  Can you hear me?
[01:24:20.414 --> 01:24:21.975]  Yeah, I can hear you, Alex.
[01:24:21.995 --> 01:24:23.176]  Thank you very much for doing this.
[01:24:24.151 --> 01:24:27.372]  I just want to parrot what everybody else is saying.
[01:24:27.492 --> 01:24:33.974]  It seems to be somewhat of a contrived situation set up by all the governors, the council of governors.
[01:24:34.514 --> 01:24:42.297]  So if Americans really want to show support for this convoy, you can still do that and you can decentralize it and you don't have to worry about infiltrators.
[01:24:42.677 --> 01:24:44.939]  You can actually just go talk to your neighbors right now.
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:54.408]  You know, hold up signs, support your border, figure out where your population is sitting, and so therefore you're not getting led astray by what we can actually do.
[01:24:54.648 --> 01:24:56.990]  This is our last chance, I think.
[01:24:58.141 --> 01:25:01.284]  Well, that's right.
[01:25:01.544 --> 01:25:03.746]  Biden knows that all the indictments backfired.
[01:25:03.787 --> 01:25:04.667]  Obama knows that.
[01:25:05.168 --> 01:25:06.609]  And so they know there's a border crisis.
[01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:07.510]  We should do something.
[01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:08.791]  What the states are doing is good.
[01:25:09.232 --> 01:25:10.413]  Overall, what Texas is doing is good.
[01:25:10.433 --> 01:25:13.756]  I'm not saying it's negative, but they're going to try to grab victory from the jaws of defeat.
[01:25:14.036 --> 01:25:15.257]  They're going to try to pull a January 6th.
[01:25:15.277 --> 01:25:15.878]  I think that's clear.
[01:25:17.988 --> 01:25:23.430]  It's super clear, and America showed that fear, you know, because they didn't go out and process the shots.
[01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:31.573]  They were too afraid of a centralized movement being infiltrated by the feds and having that headache of what, like, Rufio and Joe Diggs are going through right now.
[01:25:31.933 --> 01:25:32.474]  The nightmares.
[01:25:33.054 --> 01:25:34.534]  So, decentralize it.
[01:25:34.674 --> 01:25:37.155]  Go out to George Street, America.
[01:25:37.195 --> 01:25:39.956]  This is our, this is, you know, this is all I really have to say.
[01:25:39.996 --> 01:25:45.338]  This is what I've been hammering on Infowars because you guys are an amazing program and platform for human freedom and liberty.
[01:25:45.538 --> 01:25:46.959]  Team Humanity.
[01:25:47.677 --> 01:25:49.138]  And you assist the local people.
[01:25:49.198 --> 01:25:50.238]  That's the power.
[01:25:50.579 --> 01:25:53.260]  The court of public opinion starts with us.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:54.581]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:25:54.981 --> 01:25:55.381]  God bless.
[01:25:56.021 --> 01:25:56.481]  Thank you.
[01:25:56.602 --> 01:25:57.622]  Great, great point.
[01:25:58.422 --> 01:26:02.925]  Now, we have our own InfoWars account that's putting this out right now, but I've seen a fan InfoWars account.
[01:26:03.285 --> 01:26:04.165]  They've done a great job over the years.
[01:26:04.185 --> 01:26:07.127]  I don't even know who they are, but it's like red, white, and blue down there.
[01:26:07.167 --> 01:26:07.747]  I saw that.
[01:26:08.548 --> 01:26:09.388]  I want to try to go to them.
[01:26:09.788 --> 01:26:10.889]  There's also a fan account.
[01:26:11.509 --> 01:26:12.790]  They call it Marjorie Taylor Greens.
[01:26:13.766 --> 01:26:16.587]  Okay, I'm going to do my best to get them speaker access.
[01:26:17.027 --> 01:26:20.789]  In the meantime, let's hear from Lenka because she's been requesting to speak for some time.
[01:26:20.809 --> 01:26:21.109]  Let's do it.
[01:26:20.929 --> 01:26:23.529]  Let's go to the Marjorie Taylor Greene press office person.
[01:26:23.529 --> 01:26:27.009]  Okay, I'm going to do my best to get them speaker access.
[01:26:27.009 --> 01:26:31.489]   In the meantime, let's hear from Lenka because she's been requesting to speak for some time.
[01:26:31.489 --> 01:26:32.489]  Let's do it.
[01:26:32.489 --> 01:26:33.489]  Lenka.
[01:26:33.489 --> 01:26:34.489]  Hi, everyone.
[01:26:34.489 --> 01:26:36.288]  Thank you so much.
[01:26:36.288 --> 01:26:40.291]  As you can hear, I'm an immigrant actually, but a legal one.
[01:26:40.872 --> 01:26:46.717]  And I can tell you that it is a long and expensive process to become one, but I'm happy about it.
[01:26:47.277 --> 01:26:53.182]  I live in New York and I can say that I see here many illegal immigrants, you know, all around.
[01:26:53.922 --> 01:27:00.308]  And yesterday I saw like six-year-old girl from Guatemala selling candies in the subway.
[01:27:01.228 --> 01:27:06.331]  It was very sad, but I was just curious what's your opinion?
[01:27:07.051 --> 01:27:08.852]  What is the end to this all?
[01:27:08.892 --> 01:27:11.174]  We had the highest numbers in December.
[01:27:11.194 --> 01:27:15.876]  Do you think the end is a new president or a new government?
[01:27:16.036 --> 01:27:17.677]  When will it end?
[01:27:18.438 --> 01:27:18.718]  Thank you.
[01:27:21.104 --> 01:27:24.786]  Absolutely, all the horrors of the third world and child labor and all of it.
[01:27:25.146 --> 01:27:27.407]  Even the New York Times admitted it's here, including sex slavery.
[01:27:27.427 --> 01:27:29.368]  And the idea that we're helping these people is a lie.
[01:27:29.388 --> 01:27:32.969]  They're bringing in a group to vote for them, a permanent underclass they control.
[01:27:33.329 --> 01:27:34.310]  Chase, you want to comment on that?
[01:27:37.031 --> 01:27:40.412]  I would love to comment on it, but I wasn't paying attention because I was managing the space, Alex.
[01:27:41.213 --> 01:27:42.133]  Tell me who to go to next.
[01:27:43.073 --> 01:27:46.635]  Let's hear from Marjorie Taylor Greene, Press Secretary, parody account.
[01:27:50.236 --> 01:27:51.378]  Go ahead and unmute yourself.
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:55.423]  Marjorie Taylor Greene, parody account.
[01:27:56.124 --> 01:27:57.185]  You are now on the air.
[01:27:57.225 --> 01:27:57.706]  Can you hear us?
[01:28:00.369 --> 01:28:01.150]  They're just hitting hearts.
[01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:02.432]  Apparently they don't want to speak right now.
[01:28:02.452 --> 01:28:04.194]  They must be in a noisy environment.
[01:28:04.875 --> 01:28:06.837]  Let's get Lacey McDermott on.
[01:28:06.878 --> 01:28:08.259]  She's been requesting to speak for some time.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:08.600]  Sure.
[01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:12.812]  Hi everybody and hi Alex.
[01:28:12.912 --> 01:28:18.677]  First of all, I just quickly want to say you are the reason why I am into politics today.
[01:28:18.697 --> 01:28:31.943]   The first time I ever knew anything about you was when you were exposing the Hillary Clinton emails. So I want to personally thank you for opening up my
[01:28:31.943 --> 01:28:39.873]   eyes and seeing things for what is happening today. My comment that I do have is I
[01:28:39.873 --> 01:28:45.802]   cannot stop thinking about all the illegal aliens that are here. I have a huge gut feeling
[01:28:45.802 --> 01:28:51.633]   that in some way, shape or form that Biden is going to possibly use these people
[01:28:51.633 --> 01:28:57.143]   against us, whether it's his own army against us, I don't know.
[01:28:57.143 --> 01:29:04.387]   By the way, the movie Red Dawn that came out in the the 80s was based on a real Rex 84 Pentagon emergency plan
[01:29:04.387 --> 01:29:09.127]   for the Soviet Union flooding us with illegal aliens full of sleeper cells
[01:29:09.127 --> 01:29:12.857]   to take us down. So I think that's a very real issue that our own government,
[01:29:12.857 --> 01:29:16.577]   not the Russians, are using against us. That's a great point. Is that where you're
[01:29:16.577 --> 01:29:19.827]  going? Yes, sir.
[01:29:19.827 --> 01:29:22.827]  Absolutely.
[01:29:20.911 --> 01:29:27.842]  I mean, this is all, the number of known terrorists coming across is just mind boggling while they still try to grope us at the TSA.
[01:29:27.862 --> 01:29:30.626]  I mean, how illustrative is that this is all a fraud?
[01:29:32.731 --> 01:29:51.977]  I absolutely agree, but I do feel that I think when Puppet's the fan, I don't know if they're going to dispatch these people into locking us down or what's going to happen, but I just feel like that's a whole lot of people and a whole lot of age-fighting men that are over here just for votes.
[01:29:52.197 --> 01:29:53.077]  It's bigger than that.
[01:29:53.897 --> 01:29:54.518]  Absolutely.
[01:29:54.558 --> 01:29:59.682]  So the whole idea to take your rights away for security for a virus or crime is to defund the police is a lie.
[01:30:00.002 --> 01:30:02.904]  They're breaking down our society, they're demoralizing us for the Great Reset.
[01:30:03.224 --> 01:30:03.945]  Thank you so much.
[01:30:03.985 --> 01:30:05.406]  Chase, who should we go to next?
[01:30:05.766 --> 01:30:07.808]  I think we should talk to Bill Elmore next.
[01:30:07.888 --> 01:30:11.951]  Bill Elmore has been a frequent guest on our Spaces for the American Journal this week.
[01:30:12.051 --> 01:30:20.077]  I believe, as we discovered this week, he may have actually been the first person ever to combine terrestrial radio with the X-Spaces.
[01:30:20.597 --> 01:30:22.439]  So let's hear from Bill and see what he has to say.
[01:30:24.332 --> 01:30:25.673]  Actually, I can't take credit for that.
[01:30:26.493 --> 01:30:32.515]  You have Hot Tamale02 down there in the audience who did that, but thank you for that.
[01:30:33.396 --> 01:30:40.899]  I just, and I'm sorry if you guys already answered this question, but, you know, I got to ask the question, why is Biden fighting so hard?
[01:30:40.959 --> 01:30:44.600]  Why is he saying, hey, I'll do this if you pass another law.
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.841]  He could do it today, right?
[01:30:47.021 --> 01:30:48.562]  Why is he fighting so hard?
[01:30:49.642 --> 01:30:54.785]  Because he wants to hold us hostage with an open border for Ukraine funding and Israel funding.
[01:30:54.825 --> 01:30:58.867]  And plus, the House and Senate deals legalize an open border.
[01:30:59.107 --> 01:31:03.370]  They don't end illegal immigration the way we think it does, like Trump did, or shut it down.
[01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:05.491]  It ends it by legalizing it.
[01:31:05.531 --> 01:31:09.693]  So when Trump said don't do that deal, the media spun it that Trump's against a border control deal.
[01:31:10.053 --> 01:31:10.553]  No he's not.
[01:31:10.633 --> 01:31:11.194]  It's a fraud.
[01:31:11.234 --> 01:31:12.034]  It's amnesty.
[01:31:14.816 --> 01:31:15.276]  Absolutely.
[01:31:15.696 --> 01:31:16.877]  Absolutely.
[01:31:18.243 --> 01:31:27.592]  There's nothing good with having an open border, having all these terrorists, open terrorists, we're seeing them on videos, we're seeing them coming across boats on the shores, right?
[01:31:27.612 --> 01:31:32.116]  We're seeing the terrorists coming into our country, and Biden is fighting to let them in.
[01:31:32.576 --> 01:31:40.804]  And everybody, whether you're a Democrat, I don't care who you follow, you know, there's no reason to open up borders to these people.
[01:31:42.188 --> 01:31:45.431]  Sir, I 150% agree with you.
[01:31:46.212 --> 01:31:47.774]  And so I can't say Texas is wrong.
[01:31:47.834 --> 01:31:49.135]  I can't say the state of Georgia is wrong.
[01:31:49.175 --> 01:31:49.775]  It's beautiful.
[01:31:50.276 --> 01:31:52.078]  We've just got to be looking for the trap.
[01:31:52.438 --> 01:31:54.941]  That's why everybody's got to be watching and videotaping.
[01:31:55.241 --> 01:31:57.003]  Because you know the left's going to provocateur.
[01:31:57.802 --> 01:32:00.882]  and make up abuse of migrants.
[01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:03.162]  Because this issue is destroying the globalists.
[01:32:03.162 --> 01:32:06.402]   It was meant to save them, but they can't bring enough illegals right away
[01:32:06.402 --> 01:32:07.363]  and have them vote.
[01:32:07.363 --> 01:32:10.641]   There's not a new census yet, and so they can apportion all these illegals
[01:32:10.641 --> 01:32:12.443]  and get their new congressional seats.
[01:32:12.443 --> 01:32:13.641]  That's down the road.
[01:32:13.641 --> 01:32:16.001]  So they're a day late and a dollar short.
[01:32:16.001 --> 01:32:20.962]   They need something to demonize folks that believe in a border and sovereignty.
[01:32:20.962 --> 01:32:21.802]  What is that gonna be?
[01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:22.622]  What do you think?
[01:32:26.443 --> 01:32:34.242]   I, I, I'm just boggled by, I'm fully in support of Texas.
[01:32:34.212 --> 01:32:45.335]  I'm in support of every GOP governor who's willing to, you know, put their name, their state, their National Guard, you know, to help fight this.
[01:32:45.455 --> 01:32:52.556]  I love the truckers, the bikers, the farmers, everybody that's down there that's in support of this.
[01:32:53.216 --> 01:32:56.677]  Absolutely, it's not a criticism of them to say look out and don't get set up.
[01:32:59.677 --> 01:33:00.418]  You're right, Alex.
[01:33:01.318 --> 01:33:02.679]  Hey, I already went through January 6th.
[01:33:02.699 --> 01:33:07.562]  You just expect the National Guard and the Secret Service and the Feds to do the right thing, and they totally set us up.
[01:33:07.922 --> 01:33:14.246]  We do not want to walk into that now, but we don't want to be paralyzed to not go down there and cover it and watch it and see what is happening.
[01:33:14.266 --> 01:33:15.086]  Thank you so much.
[01:33:15.767 --> 01:33:16.947]  Chase Geiser, who's up next?
[01:33:17.828 --> 01:33:18.668]  Let's hear from Chell.
[01:33:18.848 --> 01:33:19.569]  Chell's a good guest.
[01:33:20.890 --> 01:33:21.150]  Go ahead.
[01:33:23.177 --> 01:33:24.398]  Hello Alex, it's nice to meet you.
[01:33:24.438 --> 01:33:24.858]  I'm Shell.
[01:33:25.239 --> 01:33:28.441]  Hey, last week we had Victor Avila on our show.
[01:33:28.841 --> 01:33:32.223]  He is an HSI ICE border agent, special agent.
[01:33:32.904 --> 01:33:36.386]  He's also running for Congress in District 23 in Texas.
[01:33:37.527 --> 01:33:41.170]  And he told us that there is a deal being brokered between the US and Mexico.
[01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.431]  Absolutely.
[01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:46.831]  In this deal, this demand is for that $40 billion.
[01:33:46.831 --> 01:33:53.189]   US, the Mexican are demanding that the US drop the $40 billion in sanctions against
[01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:59.309]   Venezuela and they're demanding that all their citizens illegally here get citizenship.
[01:33:59.309 --> 01:34:01.510]  What are your thoughts on that, Mr. Alex?
[01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:02.350]  Absolutely.
[01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:07.949]   Biden totally opening the border up is about getting voters, it's about getting a new slave class.
[01:34:07.949 --> 01:34:12.949]   But it's also about putting pressure on Congress to pass the so-called border deal
[01:34:12.949 --> 01:34:16.750]  that Obama tried to get and a bunch of others got.
[01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:19.270]  That just basically lets them legalize whoever they want.
[01:34:19.281 --> 01:34:22.927]  And then Mexico wants a big piece of money to do that as well.
[01:34:22.967 --> 01:34:24.951]  So there's a lot of jockeying going on right now.
[01:34:29.586 --> 01:34:34.991]  Hey Alex, Shell, who just spoke, I just wanted to give her a really good introduction.
[01:34:35.491 --> 01:34:42.817]  She has linked not only radio, but just last week, Patriot TV, and they worked out the 90-second delay.
[01:34:42.837 --> 01:34:45.019]  They've done some tremendous work.
[01:34:45.099 --> 01:34:46.180]  I think she can help you out.
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:49.783]  You guys, a lot of you are getting into the spaces.
[01:34:49.803 --> 01:34:54.506]   It's very amazing and going Oh, thank you for being part of this!
[01:34:54.326 --> 01:34:59.926]   the world. So I just can't recommend her highly enough to help you guys as you go through this.
[01:34:59.926 --> 01:35:03.244]  So thanks for letting her and me up on the stage.
[01:35:03.244 --> 01:35:06.326]  Oh, thank you for being part of this. Sorry, go ahead, ma'am.
[01:35:06.326 --> 01:35:09.244]  I would be happy to help. I would be happy to help anytime.
[01:35:09.355 --> 01:35:13.156]  I ran seven and a half hour spaces for a new different media company.
[01:35:13.797 --> 01:35:17.998]  And we got terrestrial radio and live television through those spaces.
[01:35:18.158 --> 01:35:19.118]  It was fantastic.
[01:35:19.638 --> 01:35:24.819]  Unfortunately, Alex, they didn't see the benefit of spaces and wanted to stop.
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:26.700]  But I'm glad you're bringing it back, sir.
[01:35:27.619 --> 01:35:28.759]  It's all very innovative.
[01:35:28.799 --> 01:35:31.060]  I did a Space with Elon Musk, got like 100 million views.
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:32.740]  So, thank you so much.
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:33.260]  All right.
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:38.561]  Chase Geyser is moderating this and running the control panel in there right now.
[01:35:38.601 --> 01:35:40.282]  We're continuing to take your comments.
[01:35:40.322 --> 01:35:40.702]  Go ahead.
[01:35:41.662 --> 01:35:43.522]  Let's hear from Right Angle News Network.
[01:35:43.542 --> 01:35:44.762]  They've been waiting to speak for some time.
[01:35:46.983 --> 01:35:47.543]  Hey, Alex.
[01:35:47.603 --> 01:35:49.523]  I just want to say thank you for letting me on stage.
[01:35:49.563 --> 01:35:49.883]  Thank you.
[01:35:49.923 --> 01:35:52.664]  I've been a huge supporter of your work for the longest time.
[01:35:53.582 --> 01:35:55.324]  I have two questions, if you don't mind.
[01:35:56.425 --> 01:35:58.166]  Well, let's just be clear.
[01:35:58.226 --> 01:35:58.666]  Let me clear.
[01:35:58.746 --> 01:36:00.108]  Thank you for being part of this.
[01:36:00.468 --> 01:36:01.509]  And thank you for having questions.
[01:36:01.549 --> 01:36:02.389]  And I got questions for you.
[01:36:02.410 --> 01:36:02.810]  Go ahead.
[01:36:04.571 --> 01:36:05.312]  Thank you so much.
[01:36:05.993 --> 01:36:09.736]  One, like I said, the other is a question.
[01:36:09.836 --> 01:36:10.216]  One isn't.
[01:36:13.161 --> 01:36:27.151]  I believe that the federal officials are attempting to try to get conservatives and Republicans alike to do something to slip up so that they have a reason to crack the whip with this whole border dispute.
[01:36:27.391 --> 01:36:37.819]  And I just want to say that I think we all need to be extremely cautious to ensure that we do not give the government any reason to do anything else to us that they already have.
[01:36:38.439 --> 01:36:47.679]   And secondly, I want to ask you, why do you think the globalist elites try to silence people like yourself from waking everyone up?
[01:36:48.901 --> 01:36:53.469]  Well, from your lips to God's ears, I mean, it's not your opinion what you just said.
[01:36:54.438 --> 01:36:59.562]  Obviously, anything we do as populists, as people that want freedom, is going to be demonized and attacked.
[01:37:00.742 --> 01:37:02.884]  And so, yeah, they're going to have Antifa at the border.
[01:37:03.224 --> 01:37:04.665]  Yeah, they're going to have covert groups.
[01:37:04.685 --> 01:37:05.666]  Yeah, they're going to stage stuff.
[01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:07.767]  But we're not asleep like we were.
[01:37:08.047 --> 01:37:08.688]  Here's the problem.
[01:37:08.728 --> 01:37:10.089]  Trump had had hundreds of rallies.
[01:37:10.509 --> 01:37:12.210]  We'd had three or four in months before January 6.
[01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:14.932]  We had a half million at one, almost a million at another.
[01:37:15.592 --> 01:37:17.253]  And nothing happened because Antifa hit out.
[01:37:17.333 --> 01:37:18.194]  We got set up.
[01:37:18.774 --> 01:37:21.036]  While Trump was speaking, they were already attacking the Capitol.
[01:37:21.376 --> 01:37:22.377]  The Fed stood down.
[01:37:22.457 --> 01:37:23.578]  We all know what happened there now.
[01:37:24.478 --> 01:37:25.398]  Now we're watching.
[01:37:26.119 --> 01:37:28.699]  So we're not going down to the border to be mean to the illegals.
[01:37:28.719 --> 01:37:30.080]  We're not going down there to do any of this.
[01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:32.780]  We're there to show militias.
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:33.941]  And militias are constitutional.
[01:37:33.961 --> 01:37:34.361]  They're great.
[01:37:34.421 --> 01:37:38.222]  But like with Governor Whitmer, the feds lead militias they've created.
[01:37:38.242 --> 01:37:40.123]  And so you've got to think, what would they do?
[01:37:40.163 --> 01:37:41.063]  They'd stage a shooting.
[01:37:41.083 --> 01:37:42.043]  They'd stage a torture.
[01:37:42.463 --> 01:37:44.684]  They'd stage a sexual assault of a migrant.
[01:37:45.584 --> 01:37:49.066]  How are they going to change this whole subject around when it's totally destroying the deep state?
[01:37:49.387 --> 01:37:52.108]  They're going to, and it's good that Texas did this, and it's good the state's doing it.
[01:37:52.329 --> 01:37:53.449]  We've got to go oppose it.
[01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:55.230]  But it's like in a boxing match.
[01:37:55.250 --> 01:38:00.474]  Somebody hit, punch you first, you're going to try to punch them back, but they're going to try to hit you with a left hook or something.
[01:38:00.774 --> 01:38:01.635]  You've got to be aware of that.
[01:38:01.655 --> 01:38:02.835]  So I don't think it's your opinion.
[01:38:03.916 --> 01:38:05.597]  What you're saying is 100% dead on.
[01:38:05.617 --> 01:38:09.440]  And then on the second question, again, it's prima facie, again, on its face.
[01:38:10.475 --> 01:38:12.857]  The globalists fear any populace they don't control.
[01:38:13.277 --> 01:38:16.259]  I mean, I had Henry Kissinger in front of my producer trying to hire me 17 years ago.
[01:38:16.839 --> 01:38:18.280]  I was offered shows on Fox News.
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:24.084]  I was offered Glenn Beck's job before he existed to replace Rush Limbaugh because he had heart trouble and stuff decades before he died.
[01:38:24.124 --> 01:38:27.967]  The very groups tried to hire me to be Rush Limbaugh, but they told me I'd be controlled.
[01:38:28.047 --> 01:38:29.287]  Rush, by the way, was not controlled.
[01:38:29.307 --> 01:38:37.313]  He was his own guy, but he'd come up organically with Roger Ailes, so he was kind of controlled himself, but at the end, the last five years or so, woke up and joined us.
[01:38:38.193 --> 01:38:41.636]  So, I've been in this since, I mean, I'm not some guy that just got successful overnight.
[01:38:41.656 --> 01:38:43.238]  I've been on air 30 years in April.
[01:38:43.698 --> 01:38:47.061]  Middle of April, I've been on air 30 years, 29 years currently.
[01:38:48.062 --> 01:38:52.786]  And so, they just fear somebody, even, let me explain something very clearly here.
[01:38:53.927 --> 01:39:00.633]  And I've read Brzezinski's books, I've read Rockefeller's books, and when I read it, it's what I've already seen them do in the real world, so I'm like, oh yeah, I figured that.
[01:39:01.815 --> 01:39:19.655]  If I was a globalist that wants you to eat bugs and for world government and open borders and pedophilia, if I wasn't part of their club, and if I wasn't going along with them, and if I wasn't meeting with them, they would come after me just as bad as they'd come after the Patriot Alex Jones.
[01:39:21.053 --> 01:39:22.775]  That's why they're threatened by Trump.
[01:39:23.396 --> 01:39:27.881]  And I'm not saying Trump's a bad guy, he's not perfect, but he's literally taking over their system.
[01:39:27.921 --> 01:39:30.845]  We think it's for us, and I hope it is, but I don't completely trust Trump.
[01:39:31.445 --> 01:39:32.066]  Nobody's perfect.
[01:39:33.107 --> 01:39:34.769]  They see Trump as a real threat.
[01:39:35.290 --> 01:39:39.435]  So whether I was a good guy fighting tyranny or a bad guy fighting tyranny, nobody makes this point.
[01:39:40.447 --> 01:39:47.349]  They don't like somebody that doesn't go to their retreats, that doesn't literally have sex with prostitutes with them, that's bare minimum.
[01:39:47.789 --> 01:39:51.370]  You go meet with these people, they immediately go, I got prostitutes, let's go do it.
[01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:52.630]  I've had them do it.
[01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:58.052]  And it wasn't illegal or whatever in the jurisdiction, so I didn't, it was in confidence, but I mean, I'm like...
[01:39:58.972 --> 01:40:08.414]  28 years old, on hundreds of radio stations, the next Rush Limbaugh, and like, oh, come talk to this group, and you're talking to the head of a company, and it's like, hey man, you like this woman?
[01:40:08.434 --> 01:40:10.074]  Let's, you know, bang her right now on the desk.
[01:40:10.674 --> 01:40:21.857]  So, they use sex entry-level prostitutes, then 16-year-olds and 14-year-olds, then they go, well, this never happened to me, I never got into the underage stuff, I never even, you know, had sex when they offered it.
[01:40:21.877 --> 01:40:22.797]  I thought it was a setup.
[01:40:22.817 --> 01:40:23.397]  I'm like, are you kidding?
[01:40:23.437 --> 01:40:24.357]  I'm here for a job.
[01:40:25.317 --> 01:40:26.178]  I'm promoting freedom.
[01:40:26.438 --> 01:40:27.318]  I'm not going to be controlled.
[01:40:28.118 --> 01:40:29.960]  It's that I wasn't controlled.
[01:40:30.641 --> 01:40:33.744]  In fact, sometimes I ask God, will you just take full control of me?
[01:40:34.064 --> 01:40:38.929]  Like, that's what my prayer is every day, because I'm not... There ain't nobody in control here, folks.
[01:40:39.169 --> 01:40:44.094]  Anybody that works here knows Buck stops right here, 50 years old, doing this 30 years.
[01:40:44.515 --> 01:40:45.355]  I am who I am.
[01:40:45.375 --> 01:40:47.798]  I stand for what I stand, and that's it.
[01:40:48.218 --> 01:40:51.401]  So, you know, I could be an evil Satanist.
[01:40:52.144 --> 01:40:57.184]   But if I wasn't following their orders, they would come after me probably even worse.
[01:40:57.184 --> 01:40:58.184]  In fact, I know that.
[01:40:58.184 --> 01:41:02.823]   If you've served God and you're protected by that energy field, you'll still get attacked,
[01:41:02.823 --> 01:41:06.224]  but God protects you because I've never taken the bait.
[01:41:06.224 --> 01:41:10.423]  But this is a methodology they've got of control.
[01:41:10.424 --> 01:41:19.768]  So of course they're coming after me because not only am I somebody they can't control, I'm somebody trying to be led by the Holy Spirit through my imperfect spirit.
[01:41:20.329 --> 01:41:21.369]  I'm picking that up though.
[01:41:22.009 --> 01:41:24.010]  It all projects through a rose color darkly.
[01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:26.291]  We're all distorted, we're sinful, we're fallen.
[01:41:26.631 --> 01:41:30.073]  But to the enemy, I don't look like a devil.
[01:41:30.373 --> 01:41:34.735]  To myself, because I know I'm fallen, I look horrible and dirty rags before God.
[01:41:35.695 --> 01:41:36.015]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:41:36.035 --> 01:41:37.116]  I apologize for speaking over you.
[01:41:37.136 --> 01:41:37.356]  I did not.
[01:41:37.396 --> 01:41:37.836]  You cut out.
[01:41:37.716 --> 01:41:43.115]   I don't look like that. I look like a reflection of God's will and that's why they're so afraid.
[01:41:43.115 --> 01:41:45.115]  Did that answer your question?
[01:41:45.115 --> 01:41:53.315]   Yeah, absolutely. I apologize for speaking over you. I did not. You cut out. I'm so sorry
[01:41:53.315 --> 01:41:54.316]  about that.
[01:41:54.316 --> 01:41:57.075]  No, I didn't even know. How much of that did you just miss?
[01:41:57.075 --> 01:41:58.356]  I heard all of it.
[01:41:58.470 --> 01:42:02.231]  The last maybe 15 seconds, I didn't hear anything.
[01:42:02.592 --> 01:42:03.472]  It doesn't matter, I'm preaching.
[01:42:03.812 --> 01:42:05.853]  The point is, they don't like anybody they don't control.
[01:42:06.133 --> 01:42:10.254]  Xi Jinping is just as evil as the worst Anglo-American New World Order operative.
[01:42:10.854 --> 01:42:13.615]  But nine years ago, he broke with them and double-crossed them.
[01:42:14.035 --> 01:42:17.316]  And now he's doing, you have three children, you know, he's breaking with them.
[01:42:17.336 --> 01:42:18.116]  He's still super evil.
[01:42:18.536 --> 01:42:20.417]  They don't like him because he's not under their control.
[01:42:20.437 --> 01:42:20.977]  Does that make sense?
[01:42:24.608 --> 01:42:25.149]  Absolutely 100%.
[01:42:25.229 --> 01:42:27.993]  By the way, you're a smart guy.
[01:42:28.013 --> 01:42:28.534]  Keep talking.
[01:42:28.634 --> 01:42:30.236]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[01:42:30.256 --> 01:42:30.597]  Go ahead.
[01:42:30.697 --> 01:42:32.259]  I want to hear from Alex Jones here.
[01:42:34.763 --> 01:42:36.906]  Yeah, I agree with everything you say.
[01:42:37.106 --> 01:42:39.289]  They shut down people like you because...
[01:42:40.336 --> 01:42:43.078]  You wake up people in mass and they don't like that.
[01:42:43.138 --> 01:42:46.141]  They don't like that their agenda is put on display for everyone to see.
[01:42:46.861 --> 01:42:51.645]  And they know that whenever their agenda is on display, it's ridiculous.
[01:42:51.685 --> 01:42:53.166]  And everyone can see that it's ridiculous.
[01:42:53.466 --> 01:42:53.826]  That's right.
[01:42:53.907 --> 01:42:55.748]  No one wants to buy their agenda.
[01:42:55.788 --> 01:42:59.791]  They're selling sewage water and bugs.
[01:43:03.854 --> 01:43:04.355]  Absolutely.
[01:43:04.675 --> 01:43:05.656]  And we can't buy from them.
[01:43:07.417 --> 01:43:09.999]  Well, what is your gut level feeling on what's about to happen at the border?
[01:43:12.573 --> 01:43:28.037]  I genuinely believe that if every single state in the union doesn't stand up with Texas, we're about to have a complete breakdown at our border and it might devolve into a civil war.
[01:43:28.157 --> 01:43:30.198]  Honestly, I hate to say it, but I think it might.
[01:43:32.899 --> 01:43:34.379]  Brother, I totally agree with you.
[01:43:34.399 --> 01:43:36.720]  And the good news is there's not just evil in the universe.
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:38.140]  There's good as well.
[01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:40.881]  Thank you so much for joining us here on Spaces.
[01:43:41.437 --> 01:43:42.957]  Alright, let's continue with everybody else.
[01:43:42.977 --> 01:43:44.058]  Who do we go to next, Chase?
[01:43:44.658 --> 01:43:45.998]  Let's hear from Carolina Bonita.
[01:43:46.238 --> 01:43:46.998]  Carolina, what's up?
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:52.840]  Not sure if she's still tuned in.
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:54.920]  Let's go to, uh, Based Boys Media.
[01:43:57.661 --> 01:43:59.121]  Hey, uh, Alex, can you hear me?
[01:43:59.822 --> 01:44:00.822]  You're a little muffled, but yes.
[01:44:02.342 --> 01:44:04.203]  Okay, let me, uh, let me take off the Bluetooth real quick.
[01:44:04.243 --> 01:44:05.223]  That'll, uh, probably do it.
[01:44:07.383 --> 01:44:08.384]  Okay, now you can hear me better.
[01:44:08.624 --> 01:44:09.604]  Loud and clear, go ahead.
[01:44:11.438 --> 01:44:11.879]  Awesome, man.
[01:44:11.919 --> 01:44:15.041]  Hey, thanks for taking me on this call or on this Twitter space.
[01:44:15.101 --> 01:44:15.702]  Glad to be here.
[01:44:16.302 --> 01:44:18.905]  Man, I'm just really sick of what's going on in the world, especially with this border.
[01:44:19.585 --> 01:44:26.051]  And it's inclined me to basically take my own personal account on X and create a media platform as Baseboys Media here.
[01:44:26.731 --> 01:44:29.213]  You know, we have a podcast and we expose the corruption.
[01:44:29.493 --> 01:44:38.360]   You know, you're an inspiring dude, but my comment to this and what's going on at the border is You know, I think the most dangerous thing is the mindset that comes here from these illegal migrants.
[01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:40.021]  It's not even just the crime and the terrorism.
[01:44:40.061 --> 01:44:50.125]  It's mostly the mindset of submitting to the government and listening to these NGOs and these people that tell them that they're going to get this prosperous life if they come here.
[01:44:50.165 --> 01:44:57.248]  And it's dangerous because they don't really understand the idea of America and the ideals that we hold.
[01:44:57.868 --> 01:44:59.109]  And I think it's really dangerous.
[01:44:59.169 --> 01:45:06.771]   And my question to you is, how do we, like, Do you see America as an interventionist or an isolationist?
[01:45:06.811 --> 01:45:16.377]  Because, you know, I think the thing, you know, they pitch this humanitarian thing to, you know, these NGOs are helping people out, but really they're not.
[01:45:16.437 --> 01:45:21.261]  They're destroying them, they're sending them through the Darien Gap, they're freezing, they're dying, encountering the cartels.
[01:45:22.081 --> 01:45:24.123]  How do we restore democracy in these countries?
[01:45:24.143 --> 01:45:26.584]  Because I think that's the only way to help people.
[01:45:26.644 --> 01:45:28.626]  All right, well, we had a lot of great commenters.
[01:45:28.746 --> 01:45:29.306]  Don't hang up.
[01:45:29.366 --> 01:45:30.527]  I want to come back to you in a moment.
[01:45:30.567 --> 01:45:31.628]  You've asked the best questions.
[01:45:32.341 --> 01:45:32.581]  Okay.
[01:45:33.461 --> 01:45:37.082]  You study George Washington saying we shouldn't be involved in foreign entanglements.
[01:45:37.542 --> 01:45:41.303]  We should be isolationist to produce products instead of war.
[01:45:42.384 --> 01:45:44.304]  Because he was all about, he was a warrior.
[01:45:44.324 --> 01:45:45.224]  I mean, study his whole history.
[01:45:45.564 --> 01:45:51.846]  You know, 15 years old in a combat militia, out doing surveys in the radically dangerous Indian country.
[01:45:52.634 --> 01:45:58.198]  And if he noticed that everything went to war instead of product, he wanted to end war and have it about product.
[01:45:58.218 --> 01:45:59.098]  That's what Trump wants.
[01:45:59.699 --> 01:46:00.920]  Commerce instead of war.
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:04.202]  Prosperity instead of conflict.
[01:46:05.062 --> 01:46:09.125]  And so then you get the Monroe Doctrine later saying, okay, well, the U.S.
[01:46:09.145 --> 01:46:11.947]  will just control this hemisphere, not the other hemisphere.
[01:46:12.207 --> 01:46:13.548]  We become an empire at that point.
[01:46:14.733 --> 01:46:16.533]  So yeah, Manifest Destiny, all of that.
[01:46:16.573 --> 01:46:27.996]  Well, you can say Manifest Destiny's bad, but other people, like the Communists and the British Royals and others, or the Japanese Imperials later, they're going to have their Manifest Destiny.
[01:46:28.036 --> 01:46:35.777]  So if you don't have a destiny you're for, you don't have a destiny, you've advocated it, you've handed it over.
[01:46:35.857 --> 01:46:37.377]  So that's the answer to your first question.
[01:46:37.777 --> 01:46:57.785]   I see ourselves as military, Isolationist, and then with our culture, total interventionist, and it's going to be so hot and so cool and so innovative and so amazing, and we got the best technology and we don't suppress technology, we take over the world through ideas 1776 worldwide.
[01:46:58.285 --> 01:47:11.674]   Then your other point, the average poor illegal alien coming in under the UN treaty with three years of lockdowns in their countries under IMF World Bank control, The 90 plus percent in big polls said we're starving to death, we don't have jobs.
[01:47:11.734 --> 01:47:14.917]  They're victims, they're refugees of the New World Order.
[01:47:15.297 --> 01:47:19.860]  Whether the New World Order brings them in as a political weapon, they don't know what's going on.
[01:47:20.241 --> 01:47:22.202]  So I love a glass of water after I go for a hike.
[01:47:22.742 --> 01:47:24.023]  I love to take a shower in water.
[01:47:25.525 --> 01:47:26.645]  77% of my body's water.
[01:47:27.206 --> 01:47:32.310]  But do I want to have 10 bowling balls tied on me and put in the end of a deep end of a pool and drown?
[01:47:32.610 --> 01:47:32.750]  No.
[01:47:33.070 --> 01:47:35.272]  Water's a great thing until you're drowned in it.
[01:47:36.201 --> 01:47:36.501]  Okay.
[01:47:37.482 --> 01:47:39.684]  And so these people are victims.
[01:47:40.264 --> 01:47:41.605]  They are pawns.
[01:47:42.646 --> 01:47:44.847]  And they're not going to get freed coming here.
[01:47:45.448 --> 01:47:47.309]  So I won't call them migrants.
[01:47:47.469 --> 01:47:49.410]  I call them illegal aliens, not to insult them.
[01:47:49.811 --> 01:47:54.394]  Under federal law, someone coming here unauthorized is an alien.
[01:47:54.674 --> 01:47:56.916]  You try to go to Mexico on the forms, you go to Cancun.
[01:47:57.994 --> 01:48:03.514]   It tells you if you don't fly out the day we say in Spanish, you'll be reported as an alien and picked up.
[01:48:03.514 --> 01:48:07.593]  Alien in Spanish just means you're not of this place.
[01:48:07.593 --> 01:48:10.394]   Okay, you don't pay taxes, you're not from here, you got to do that.
[01:48:10.394 --> 01:48:13.864]  So we have to call them illegal aliens because that's the U.S.
[01:48:13.864 --> 01:48:14.154]  law.
[01:48:14.154 --> 01:48:20.234]   But under UN treaty, it's the refugee resettlement migrant treaties.
[01:48:20.471 --> 01:48:22.614]  Even though we never ratified it, Trump pulled out of it.
[01:48:23.135 --> 01:48:24.918]  Even though Congress ratified it, Trump pulled out of it.
[01:48:25.539 --> 01:48:29.225]  First thing Biden did after he shut off the Keystone Pipeline was to put us back under it.
[01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:36.204]  And so, when they say migrant, that means they have jurisdiction and the UN decides.
[01:48:36.685 --> 01:48:44.531]  That's why you don't use the term migrant, use the term illegal alien or refugee from globalism, so we can recognize what it is.
[01:48:44.551 --> 01:48:46.652]  They say, oh, global warming is why they're all coming here.
[01:48:46.712 --> 01:48:46.933]  No.
[01:48:47.813 --> 01:48:49.154]  We got years of lockdowns here.
[01:48:49.194 --> 01:48:53.277]  They got three years, whether they worked at a farm or a factory, wherever.
[01:48:53.498 --> 01:48:54.939]  They just were told, go home and starve to death.
[01:48:55.694 --> 01:48:56.735]  And they're here like, I'm dying.
[01:48:57.115 --> 01:48:58.556]  I don't blame them at all.
[01:48:59.096 --> 01:49:07.883]  And if I could put them in a refugee camp for six months and feed them and teach them about George Washington and freedom and Jesus and how to defeat the New World Order, quite frankly, we could take a hundred million of them.
[01:49:07.903 --> 01:49:08.303]  We need them.
[01:49:08.743 --> 01:49:10.145]  Because we're not having kids here anymore.
[01:49:10.645 --> 01:49:13.387]  But you don't bring a bunch of leftists brainwashed in here.
[01:49:13.627 --> 01:49:15.108]  I don't give a rat's ass they're brown.
[01:49:15.448 --> 01:49:17.970]  Man, I know people, period, black, white, brown.
[01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:19.872]  I can sell them on freedom all day long.
[01:49:20.512 --> 01:49:22.633]  But I gotta be able to get a hold of them and sell them.
[01:49:22.973 --> 01:49:24.794]  And they haven't been sold on freedom, brother.
[01:49:25.054 --> 01:49:26.215]  They've been sold on tyranny.
[01:49:27.095 --> 01:49:30.057]  And the ones that got here, we're still selling them.
[01:49:30.077 --> 01:49:30.897]  And the numbers show that.
[01:49:31.237 --> 01:49:32.198]  That's what panicked the left.
[01:49:32.238 --> 01:49:33.238]  We're selling the Hispanics.
[01:49:33.518 --> 01:49:34.859]  We're selling the blacks on America.
[01:49:35.558 --> 01:49:36.499]  America isn't perfect.
[01:49:36.539 --> 01:49:37.980]  It's the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[01:49:38.380 --> 01:49:41.642]  Everybody wanted to come here because you got the best shot you get.
[01:49:42.142 --> 01:49:47.186]  BlackRock and Larry Fink want to get rid of that because they want consolidation, vertical integration.
[01:49:47.566 --> 01:49:50.688]  So absolutely, that's where I stand.
[01:49:50.708 --> 01:49:51.469]  Does that answer your question?
[01:49:52.628 --> 01:49:53.749]  Hey, that answers my question.
[01:49:53.789 --> 01:49:54.510]  I mean, you said it best.
[01:49:54.570 --> 01:50:00.976]  And I've got family and friends that are like, oh, you just don't want brown people or people of color in this third world behavior.
[01:50:01.277 --> 01:50:04.300]  It's all about your mindset and having that.
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:05.801]  I'm going to let you talk, but just go back to this.
[01:50:05.881 --> 01:50:07.363]  Ask them, hey, you like a glass of water?
[01:50:07.383 --> 01:50:07.943]  They're like, yeah.
[01:50:08.304 --> 01:50:10.966]  How about I stick your head in the bathtub for five minutes, see how you like that?
[01:50:10.986 --> 01:50:11.587]  You'll be dead.
[01:50:12.227 --> 01:50:13.289]  It's not that they're bad.
[01:50:13.369 --> 01:50:14.510]  We're being drowned in it.
[01:50:16.737 --> 01:50:18.698]  100%.
[01:50:16.817 --> 01:50:18.698]  You know, the solution is simple to this.
[01:50:18.778 --> 01:50:20.178]  It's just a reversal of policy.
[01:50:20.198 --> 01:50:24.999]  I mean, you got Joe Biden coming out with this memo talking about how... It's reverse colonialism.
[01:50:25.019 --> 01:50:26.379]  I know I'm interrupting you because you're on target.
[01:50:26.659 --> 01:50:32.381]  It's reverse colonialism and I say screw... I say fuck colonialism and fuck reverse colonialism.
[01:50:32.621 --> 01:50:33.641]  Sorry, I'll shut up for five minutes.
[01:50:33.681 --> 01:50:33.921]  Go ahead.
[01:50:35.001 --> 01:50:37.262]  Oh man, you're making me want to do your war cry right now.
[01:50:37.342 --> 01:50:37.702]  I love it.
[01:50:37.521 --> 01:50:38.521]  You're pumping me up.
[01:50:38.521 --> 01:50:44.900]  Yes, yes.
[01:50:44.971 --> 01:50:45.972]  It's super simple.
[01:50:45.992 --> 01:50:53.694]  But you have this, you know, O'Biden coming out with this memo or whatever it was, talking about how he's going to use the emergency authority to fix this.
[01:50:53.714 --> 01:50:55.895]  Where were you the last three years in this whole issue?
[01:50:56.955 --> 01:50:57.675]  Nowhere to be seen.
[01:50:57.755 --> 01:50:59.436]  And I don't really trust Republicans in this issue.
[01:50:59.456 --> 01:51:02.317]  I mean, what do you make of 25 states coming out?
[01:51:02.337 --> 01:51:03.937]  Do you think this is all a show?
[01:51:03.957 --> 01:51:04.317]  No, no, no.
[01:51:04.337 --> 01:51:05.538]  I mean, here's the deal.
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:15.963]  I was on a Republican 25 years ago, or even 20 years ago, because Democrats were horrible and terrible, but the Republicans were blue blood, country club, warmonger, racist, okay?
[01:51:16.463 --> 01:51:18.884]  I mean, they really were, but more elitist than racist.
[01:51:19.444 --> 01:51:21.545]  And so I wasn't for them either, and they were for a police state.
[01:51:22.345 --> 01:51:29.268]  But we got a beachhead with Trump, the Tea Party before it, so the globalists are threatened by the fact we've almost taken the Republican Party over.
[01:51:29.668 --> 01:51:32.429]  So you got the Democrat Party radicalized as evil as it can get.
[01:51:33.730 --> 01:51:35.250]  Half the Republicans are neocons.
[01:51:36.291 --> 01:51:37.191]  They pay lip service.
[01:51:39.063 --> 01:51:42.766]  Yeah, well, I know you talk about this all the time.
[01:51:42.786 --> 01:51:44.667]  There's no silver bullet to solve this.
[01:51:44.487 --> 01:51:51.487]   the people are and that's why they back Texas. So it's overall positive.
[01:51:51.487 --> 01:51:55.596]   I know you talk about this all the time. There's no silver bullet to solve this. I mean, if there's one thing that the
[01:51:55.596 --> 01:51:59.487]   everyday average American people can do, I mean, what do you think we can do moving forward?
[01:51:59.602 --> 01:52:08.688]  I mean, I would say, like King David said, to reach as many people as I possibly can, to reach out, create rhetoric revolving these massive issues that face, that we face as Americans.
[01:52:08.948 --> 01:52:10.289]  Well, here's what I'll explain to your friends.
[01:52:10.929 --> 01:52:15.952]  I'd say BlackRock and the most corrupt corporations in the world are all for open borders and replacement migration.
[01:52:16.373 --> 01:52:16.953]  I'm opposing.
[01:52:17.233 --> 01:52:18.494]  They're also for the Ukraine war.
[01:52:18.514 --> 01:52:20.495]  They're also for dollar devaluation.
[01:52:20.816 --> 01:52:21.876]  They're also for all this.
[01:52:21.916 --> 01:52:26.259]  So anything BlackRock's for, anybody that's not an idiot should be against.
[01:52:26.679 --> 01:52:40.739]   They want to If you go back 30 plus years ago, in those incredible debates with Ross Perot 31 years ago on CNN with Al Gore, and he said, listen here, Al, just five years ago we got rid of our tariffs on Canada.
[01:52:41.365 --> 01:52:42.846]  And Canada got rid of their tariffs on them.
[01:52:43.367 --> 01:52:48.391]  The average Canadian worker at an auto facility was making $45 an hour and we were making $25.
[01:52:48.431 --> 01:52:53.896]  Within one year, they went down to $25 and we didn't go up.
[01:52:54.416 --> 01:52:57.719]  Now we're opening up to Mexico where they make $5 an hour and we make $25.
[01:52:58.020 --> 01:52:59.901]  We'll lower down to $5, not $25.
[01:53:00.442 --> 01:53:03.885]  So the issue is that it's a giant sucking sound.
[01:53:04.245 --> 01:53:07.248]  We don't raise the third world when we collapse.
[01:53:08.274 --> 01:53:11.677]  They want us all totally broke, totally under their control.
[01:53:12.037 --> 01:53:12.918]  That's why they want this.
[01:53:13.018 --> 01:53:17.401]  So, anything the globalists are selling, out of hand, reject it.
[01:53:17.421 --> 01:53:24.246]  Then you can intellectually, politically, scientifically, culturally, historically, spiritually, analyze it and know that it's a horrible idea.
[01:53:24.266 --> 01:53:28.670]  It's hard to wake people up though, I mean, to these issues.
[01:53:28.710 --> 01:53:43.854]   I mean, I know these things about BlackRock, the globalists, the NGOs, but like, it seems that people care more about their sports ball and their Netflix shows and it's just, it's ridiculous that People pay taxes and pay into the system and honestly, don't give a shit.
[01:53:44.895 --> 01:53:45.676]  Here's the good news.
[01:53:47.177 --> 01:53:55.945]  And it's the bad news too, but 3% started the Revolutionary War in 1776, 5% were involved in the main war, and by the time we won, we had 20%.
[01:53:57.170 --> 01:53:59.634]  So we don't need the majority.
[01:53:59.675 --> 01:54:04.363]  We need a irate, focused, tireless minority, in the words of Thomas Jefferson.
[01:54:04.383 --> 01:54:06.587]  Thank you so much for joining us on X Spaces.
[01:54:07.108 --> 01:54:10.467]   All right, let's continue on here on this live Saturday transmission.
[01:54:10.467 --> 01:54:18.627]  By the way, Chase, you never talk.
[01:54:18.775 --> 01:54:21.177]  You do a great job when you co-host, or you fill in for me.
[01:54:21.717 --> 01:54:23.078]  Why don't you spend a few minutes here?
[01:54:23.098 --> 01:54:25.180]  You're up here, you've been working seven days a week.
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:28.602]  Why don't you spend a few minutes giving your take on this historic... I think this is a good show today.
[01:54:29.369 --> 01:54:30.570]  Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.
[01:54:30.590 --> 01:54:33.412]  We've been running around like crazy back here trying to figure out different details.
[01:54:33.573 --> 01:54:35.954]  I think the more that we do this, the better it's going to get.
[01:54:36.595 --> 01:54:46.423]  And what's really exciting to me about this is all the amazing speakers that are going to be able to come in and talk to you that may not call in traditionally.
[01:54:46.463 --> 01:54:47.244]  They may not be listening.
[01:54:47.324 --> 01:54:52.808]  And what's amazing is they're going to tell their audience and then it's going to make the show bigger and then we're going to go on their shows too.
[01:54:53.329 --> 01:54:54.570]  That's how we're going to build this community.
[01:54:55.222 --> 01:55:04.149]  Yeah, and the other thing, too, that I wanted to mention is this is an awesome way to sort of reach the next generation, and that's one of the reasons why I wanted to bring that up is because... No, that's right!
[01:55:04.189 --> 01:55:06.010]  The average person in talk radio is 75.
[01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:06.951]  I've been on talk radio 30 years.
[01:55:06.971 --> 01:55:08.252]  They're the best people around.
[01:55:08.592 --> 01:55:09.713]  But that's going away.
[01:55:09.773 --> 01:55:10.454]  This is the future.
[01:55:11.292 --> 01:55:24.962]  Absolutely, and I specifically want to call out the speaker, Dylan Fillion, who is a Gen Z MAGA America First Patriot candidate for the Iowa House of Representatives of District 93.
[01:55:25.022 --> 01:55:32.567]  He's requested to speak, and these are the types of speakers that we're going to get on spaces that we might not get on a traditional phone call when the average audience is 75 years old.
[01:55:32.587 --> 01:55:33.828]  All right, let's go to him.
[01:55:33.868 --> 01:55:34.108]  Go ahead.
[01:55:34.128 --> 01:55:34.429]  Welcome.
[01:55:35.670 --> 01:55:36.090]  Welcome.
[01:55:36.290 --> 01:55:36.850]  Hey, Alex.
[01:55:39.967 --> 01:55:40.367]  Thank you.
[01:55:40.607 --> 01:55:41.728]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:55:43.009 --> 01:56:00.823]  My generation has been, has had a war, I call it a war with truth, because obviously, you know, the left has indoctrinated, just absolutely... Yeah, they turn the young people on average into wannabe victims that are just gibbering lazy fools.
[01:56:02.186 --> 01:56:03.087]  It's stupid.
[01:56:03.527 --> 01:56:26.598]  And I really, honestly, I want to ask you, what is some advice you can give me as a young person that can help me strive through fighting these terrible people and helping me get the message across to them saying, hey, guys, we can all unite together.
[01:56:26.618 --> 01:56:28.639]  We can be stronger together.
[01:56:29.597 --> 01:56:30.958]  Like, just look at the truth.
[01:56:31.378 --> 01:56:35.259]  Just, what's some advice that you have to me for my future?
[01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:45.684]  And by the way, I want to say thank you for telling the truth for all the things you've done and all the hell you've gone through, Alex.
[01:56:45.784 --> 01:56:46.124]  I really...
[01:56:46.983 --> 01:56:47.983]  I really commend you.
[01:56:47.983 --> 01:56:48.983]  Well, let's be clear, and I appreciate you.
[01:56:48.983 --> 01:56:51.983]  And stay there, I want to come back to you in a moment.
[01:56:51.983 --> 01:56:53.342]  Let's be clear.
[01:56:53.342 --> 01:56:57.822]   The persecution I've gone through, or even Roger Stone, is nothing compared to Trump.
[01:56:57.822 --> 01:57:02.943]   I mean, I remember in elementary school and going to Sunday school and learning about
[01:57:02.943 --> 01:57:05.783]  Job and all the persecution he went through.
[01:57:05.790 --> 01:57:06.971]  And I thought, this is ridiculous.
[01:57:07.392 --> 01:57:08.252]  Who would put up with this?
[01:57:08.773 --> 01:57:12.036]  Trump is put up with beyond Jobian persecution.
[01:57:12.776 --> 01:57:13.697]  He can say what he wants.
[01:57:13.757 --> 01:57:16.039]  These people legitimately are trying to destroy him.
[01:57:16.319 --> 01:57:17.440]  He does not work for them.
[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:19.842]  They are totally scared.
[01:57:19.862 --> 01:57:26.508]  And earlier, one of the speakers, I forget who it was, said, what's your best advice?
[01:57:26.568 --> 01:57:28.950]  I kind of got interrupted or I interrupted myself and I didn't say it.
[01:57:29.810 --> 01:57:41.554]   King David, Would go to the place the most high, spend a day praying, and literally get in God's presence, and in that place of total peace, which I've only achieved a few times, would get the main download.
[01:57:41.914 --> 01:57:47.257]  So the number one thing is realizing you're an eternal spirit, made by the creator of the universe, and that you're awesome.
[01:57:47.497 --> 01:57:49.459]  You're on a beautiful planet, staring out the stars.
[01:57:49.899 --> 01:57:51.180]  The firmament is the proof of God.
[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:52.441]  It's all there.
[01:57:52.501 --> 01:57:53.801]  So just know God's real.
[01:57:54.762 --> 01:57:57.603]  Fight the globalists, but don't obsess on them, and I do it myself.
[01:57:58.103 --> 01:58:00.043]  And don't get depressed about them, and I do it myself.
[01:58:00.383 --> 01:58:01.683]  And don't get angry at them, I do it myself.
[01:58:01.703 --> 01:58:05.424]  So when I'm telling you something, one finger's pointed at you, three fingers are pointed back at me.
[01:58:06.384 --> 01:58:07.965]  And just have a relationship with God.
[01:58:08.305 --> 01:58:13.726]  And I think that, number one, will allow you, and it will make you transcend the enemy.
[01:58:13.746 --> 01:58:14.366]  Does that make sense?
[01:58:16.306 --> 01:58:16.646]  Yes.
[01:58:17.326 --> 01:58:18.006]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:58:18.086 --> 01:58:18.947]  It's an honor to be here.
[01:58:19.627 --> 01:58:20.247]  Honor to talk to you.
[01:58:20.267 --> 01:58:20.647]  Anything else?
[01:58:23.354 --> 01:58:23.815]  Uh, no.
[01:58:24.495 --> 01:58:29.759]  Other than I've introduced a bill for term limits in my state, that's about it, really.
[01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:30.840]  Well, how do people find you?
[01:58:34.744 --> 01:58:37.906]  Uh, they can find me here on Twitter.
[01:58:38.366 --> 01:58:41.687]  They can find me on True Social at Dylan Fillion.
[01:58:41.787 --> 01:58:44.168]  And they can go to my website, DylanFillion.com.
[01:58:44.408 --> 01:58:45.609]  Alright, thank you, sir.
[01:58:45.929 --> 01:58:46.409]  Thank you, brother.
[01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:53.252]  Now, we've already tried them once, but I've been seeing this account when I was banned on X the last five years with a great shot of a beautiful woman wearing one of our t-shirts.
[01:58:53.753 --> 01:58:54.913]  It's an InfoWars account.
[01:58:55.493 --> 01:58:56.794]  We already tried to go to you once.
[01:58:56.894 --> 01:58:58.115]  We'll try one more time.
[01:58:58.415 --> 01:59:00.616]  It's an InfoWars fan account and see if they're there.
[01:59:00.636 --> 01:59:01.396]  Go ahead, introduce them.
[01:59:03.137 --> 01:59:06.862]  Go ahead InfoWars fan, unmute yourself if you hear us and let us know what you think.
[01:59:06.882 --> 01:59:12.569]  I feel like I know this guy, or gal, or whoever it is.
[01:59:13.590 --> 01:59:16.214]  But we should show their account, the top of their account, amazing.
[01:59:16.854 --> 01:59:19.558]  Nothing like an InfoWars red, white, and blue shirt with a beautiful woman wearing it.
[01:59:21.956 --> 01:59:23.198]  I don't think they're going to speak, Alex.
[01:59:23.378 --> 01:59:30.346]  The middle order did not make me... I'm definitely heterosexual, so... Alright, well, if we're not going to get to them, then that's fine.
[01:59:30.826 --> 01:59:31.988]  But we should at least show their account.
[01:59:32.008 --> 01:59:34.430]  Can we click on their account to show their ex-account?
[01:59:35.288 --> 01:59:36.810]  Maybe find their home account, show people that.
[01:59:37.250 --> 01:59:38.471]  By the way, that was a t-shirt we put out.
[01:59:38.491 --> 01:59:40.453]  We made like 5,000 of them and never made it again.
[01:59:40.473 --> 01:59:41.954]  I don't know why we don't make that shirt again.
[01:59:41.974 --> 01:59:43.296]  We haven't had that shirt in like five years.
[01:59:43.856 --> 01:59:50.162]  Speak of the devil, we finally have a Team Humanity shirt, Sam, with a nuclear family, Team Humanity, from my Elon Musk discussion.
[01:59:50.722 --> 01:59:52.424]  Really important, folks, and that keeps us on air.
[01:59:52.464 --> 01:59:54.886]  Please get a Team Humanity t-shirt at InfoWarshaw.com.
[01:59:55.367 --> 01:59:56.227]  Okay, yeah, there it is.
[01:59:56.287 --> 01:59:56.888]  Isn't that nice?
[01:59:57.769 --> 01:59:59.030]  Look at that, Betsy Ross flag.
[01:59:59.050 --> 01:59:59.911]  Let's scroll down a little bit.
[02:00:01.792 --> 02:00:03.133]  Scroll down a little bit to the full t-shirt.
[02:00:03.694 --> 02:00:05.095]  We want to see the t-shirt, everybody.
[02:00:05.115 --> 02:00:05.755]  There you go.
[02:00:07.777 --> 02:00:09.198]  I love that t-shirt, man.
[02:00:09.758 --> 02:00:11.480]  God, how badass is God?
[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:13.001]  God made things like that t-shirt.
[02:00:13.341 --> 02:00:15.123]  Can we put God's creation back up there?
[02:00:15.183 --> 02:00:16.504]  Look at that t-shirt, folks.
[02:00:17.244 --> 02:00:19.046]  We got a good Lord above, don't we?
[02:00:21.607 --> 02:00:24.228]  See, I've been fanning these accounts forever.
[02:00:24.248 --> 02:00:24.929]  I want to talk to them.
[02:00:24.949 --> 02:00:26.029]  All right, enough of that.
[02:00:26.609 --> 02:00:28.530]  Let's just leave the image of the t-shirt, not the woman.
[02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:29.471]  That would be terrible.
[02:00:30.251 --> 02:00:36.274]  It's okay to have a convicted pedophile come talk to your five-year-olds, but if you say, a woman's beautiful, and they go, man, God's amazing, that's bad.
[02:00:36.354 --> 02:00:39.075]  No, no, God made me this way, and I'm going to continue to operate this way.
[02:00:39.976 --> 02:00:42.197]  Let's go to the next person, Chase.
[02:00:42.517 --> 02:00:44.178]  Yeah, let's hear from Ultramaga.
[02:00:44.218 --> 02:00:48.540]  This person's been patiently waiting to speak for quite some time, and I'm very anxious to hear what they have to say.
[02:00:50.807 --> 02:00:56.083]  Alex Jones, oh my god, I have been such like the biggest fan of yours.
[02:00:56.645 --> 02:00:57.226]  Big fan of you!
[02:00:58.928 --> 02:01:00.629]  From the very beginning, man.
[02:01:00.689 --> 02:01:03.450]  I watched you from the beginning.
[02:01:03.470 --> 02:01:04.631]  Years.
[02:01:05.531 --> 02:01:06.532]  Multiple years.
[02:01:06.852 --> 02:01:12.634]  Anyway, so Texas is the new J6 2.0.
[02:01:13.475 --> 02:01:29.663]   Unfortunately, what I'm thinking is that they have a lot of undercover people down there And that they're going to try to do what Joe Biden is going to do is call martial law.
[02:01:30.083 --> 02:01:33.845]  He has to because this is an election year.
[02:01:34.545 --> 02:01:36.166]  It's too late for COVID.
[02:01:36.666 --> 02:01:38.608]  It's too late for mail-in ballots.
[02:01:38.968 --> 02:01:40.829]  They have to stop the elections.
[02:01:41.289 --> 02:01:44.531]  This decrepit in power can't run.
[02:01:44.571 --> 02:01:45.551]  He's not running.
[02:01:46.112 --> 02:01:47.752]  He's not going to debate.
[02:01:48.513 --> 02:01:55.081]   So the only way that they can stop Like, an election is martial law.
[02:01:55.742 --> 02:01:59.986]  When he calls martial law, then everything stops.
[02:02:00.286 --> 02:02:01.447]  That's the first part.
[02:02:01.728 --> 02:02:02.689]  I have two parts.
[02:02:03.409 --> 02:02:20.643]   Second part, the military, I just saw a thing on Twitter that said that the military is now allowing people That's a fact.
[02:02:20.683 --> 02:02:21.363]  That's a fact.
[02:02:21.663 --> 02:02:28.584]  They're hiring illegal aliens to be the police and the military and to vote all over the country in blue areas and the feds are doing it.
[02:02:28.624 --> 02:02:29.844]  Thank you for your comments.
[02:02:30.264 --> 02:02:30.905]  We're gonna move quick.
[02:02:30.925 --> 02:02:34.405]  It's only doing about 15 more minutes, so I'm not I'm not pooh-poohing anybody.
[02:02:34.425 --> 02:02:35.105]  You're all amazing.
[02:02:35.485 --> 02:02:40.766]  We got to move quick to get to everybody because I got a great crew that comes in seven days a week, but they need to get back to their families.
[02:02:40.786 --> 02:02:41.286]  So do you.
[02:02:41.606 --> 02:02:43.287]  We'll be able to share this at Real Alex Jones.
[02:02:43.347 --> 02:02:43.827]  It's amazing.
[02:02:44.107 --> 02:02:46.648]   We got some Great speakers set.
[02:02:47.308 --> 02:02:48.509]  Chase Geyser, who's up next?
[02:02:49.249 --> 02:02:50.189]  Let's hear from Mandy next.
[02:02:53.311 --> 02:02:54.151]  Welcome, Mandy.
[02:02:55.712 --> 02:02:57.233]  Welcome, Megatron.
[02:02:58.053 --> 02:02:59.073]  I am Unicron.
[02:02:59.974 --> 02:03:01.034]  Who said that?
[02:03:01.935 --> 02:03:04.136]  I have summoned you here for a purpose.
[02:03:04.776 --> 02:03:07.197]  Nobody summons Megatron.
[02:03:07.898 --> 02:03:09.878]  Then it pleases me to be the first.
[02:03:10.779 --> 02:03:12.160]  State your business.
[02:03:13.908 --> 02:03:15.409]  These are my commands.
[02:03:15.969 --> 02:03:16.990]  All right, brother, you're on the air.
[02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.390]  Go ahead.
[02:03:19.051 --> 02:03:19.672]  Go ahead, Mandy.
[02:03:22.594 --> 02:03:23.354]  Hi, Alex.
[02:03:23.754 --> 02:03:24.835]  I just had a question.
[02:03:24.955 --> 02:03:29.018]  What do you think we can do to secure our borders?
[02:03:29.258 --> 02:03:30.299]  Actually, I have two.
[02:03:30.959 --> 02:03:41.246]  What do you think we should do about... Do you think we would ever have a chance at a mass deportation for all the illegal immigrants that are here now?
[02:03:42.170 --> 02:03:45.232]  Yeah, I mean, the media always calls it racist to make everybody feel bad.
[02:03:45.973 --> 02:03:47.594]  The term wetback is not racist.
[02:03:47.634 --> 02:03:48.955]  The liberals said it was racist.
[02:03:48.975 --> 02:03:51.016]  They said watermelon or fried chicken.
[02:03:51.096 --> 02:03:55.119]  One time, Bill Clinton, who's a bad guy, was in Georgia at a campaign event.
[02:03:55.139 --> 02:03:55.739]  You can look it up.
[02:03:56.199 --> 02:04:00.122]  And he ordered for people, because he likes it too, he's from the South, watermelon and fried chicken.
[02:04:00.162 --> 02:04:01.203]  That's what we eat down here.
[02:04:01.563 --> 02:04:02.924]  That's what I go out.
[02:04:02.984 --> 02:04:07.047]  You go to a redneck restaurant, you go to a black soul place.
[02:04:07.087 --> 02:04:08.007]  It's the same damn food.
[02:04:08.027 --> 02:04:08.908]  We're the same damn people.
[02:04:09.348 --> 02:04:10.449]  OK, it's all right there.
[02:04:13.090 --> 02:04:13.710]  It's the same thing.
[02:04:14.250 --> 02:04:20.312]  Eisenhower launched, I think in 1959, look it up, type in Eisenhower Operation Wetback.
[02:04:20.352 --> 02:04:21.812]  Maybe it was 58, 58 or 56.
[02:04:22.872 --> 02:04:24.492]  And there was millions of illegal aliens here.
[02:04:24.512 --> 02:04:25.513]  They were doing whatever they wanted.
[02:04:25.533 --> 02:04:26.393]  They weren't following a thing.
[02:04:26.793 --> 02:04:30.413]  He gave those that wanted to go through the proper process of legalization, those that wouldn't, he shipped back.
[02:04:30.854 --> 02:04:35.094]  And all wetback means is, the media will cover this nationally, Jones calls Mexicans wetbacks.
[02:04:35.494 --> 02:04:38.335]  No, it just means you just came under the river.
[02:04:38.775 --> 02:04:41.376]  You're wet from coming off the river.
[02:04:41.657 --> 02:04:43.918]  It doesn't mean anybody's bad.
[02:04:44.258 --> 02:04:45.499]  It's not a racial term.
[02:04:46.019 --> 02:04:46.319]  Okay?
[02:04:46.379 --> 02:04:52.382]  I mean, it's literally, I've had Northerners who I love are great people, but they've been at my house and stuff and seen a watermelon and start making a joke.
[02:04:52.422 --> 02:04:56.864]  And I get up every night from the South, you see fried chicken and watermelon, and it's like some Northern joke.
[02:04:57.225 --> 02:05:00.546]  Down here in the South, in Texas, this part of the South, it's not like a joke.
[02:05:00.846 --> 02:05:02.427]  Like, what are you doing eating collard greens?
[02:05:02.467 --> 02:05:03.228]  That's black people.
[02:05:04.088 --> 02:05:05.430]  Okay, whatever man, I'm eating them.
[02:05:05.770 --> 02:05:08.614]  So the point is, is that that's where this is.
[02:05:08.654 --> 02:05:10.437]  So yeah, you say could it happen again?
[02:05:10.457 --> 02:05:15.463]  Eisenhower launched his operation, official federal name, to deport illegals.
[02:05:17.241 --> 02:05:25.065]  All we need to do is say, sanctuary cities don't get federal funds to pay for all these people, which they get a cut of.
[02:05:25.605 --> 02:05:29.567]  All you got to do is say, we're going to do interviews with everybody and deport people that have committed crimes.
[02:05:30.147 --> 02:05:35.249]  All you got to do is not have Biden say, when I win, immediately surge the border.
[02:05:35.549 --> 02:05:36.510]  The border is wide open.
[02:05:36.810 --> 02:05:52.188]   In fact, just in the last week since Texas over the two weeks, since Texas just did the ceremony, excuse me, Since Texas just did the ceremonial thing, they have already seen an 80% reduction all over the Texas border.
[02:05:52.769 --> 02:05:58.973]  So, the perception is, is that the border is completely, absolutely wide open.
[02:05:59.493 --> 02:06:00.654]  And so that's why they're coming.
[02:06:00.674 --> 02:06:01.094]  So yeah.
[02:06:02.255 --> 02:06:02.916]  Let me ask you this.
[02:06:03.636 --> 02:06:07.419]  Do you think the government can keep you and you fly from, I don't know, where do you live?
[02:06:07.439 --> 02:06:11.562]  I live in Kentucky.
[02:06:11.862 --> 02:06:12.162]  Okay.
[02:06:12.583 --> 02:06:12.983]  Louisville?
[02:06:15.422 --> 02:06:16.143]  Oh God, no.
[02:06:16.723 --> 02:06:17.784]  Okay, well where do you live in Kentucky?
[02:06:17.804 --> 02:06:20.446]  I'm just trying to get a name.
[02:06:20.466 --> 02:06:21.547]  I live in a small town.
[02:06:21.827 --> 02:06:23.288]  Oh, you live in a small town in Kentucky.
[02:06:24.008 --> 02:06:30.293]  Now, can you fly to Dallas, Texas without going through a body scanner or having tickets or being checked by TSA?
[02:06:32.614 --> 02:06:32.895]  No.
[02:06:33.275 --> 02:06:41.521]  So, so, so, so, so, so, if they want to control the illegal aliens, can you go to AT&T and get a cell phone without driver's license?
[02:06:44.259 --> 02:06:44.520]  No.
[02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:47.504]  Can you get a passport without your old passport and driver's license?
[02:06:49.648 --> 02:06:49.848]  No.
[02:06:50.289 --> 02:06:52.152]  Can you get a job without a social security number?
[02:06:54.854 --> 02:06:55.635]  Um, no.
[02:06:56.175 --> 02:06:58.377]  Because you're being discriminated against.
[02:06:58.977 --> 02:07:04.862]  They make you do it, but the illegal aliens don't because they want to do child labor and sex slavery and exploit them.
[02:07:05.422 --> 02:07:15.069]  So they make us all love the illegals and let the feds, you know, these are NGOs literally and physically and culturally and economically raping these people.
[02:07:15.489 --> 02:07:19.673]  So the best thing you can do for us and for them is not let them be exploited.
[02:07:20.489 --> 02:07:26.511]  But they're bringing in people with no history of freedom, have no idea, to be exploited, and the drug cartels run our life.
[02:07:26.911 --> 02:07:28.492]  So there's your answer.
[02:07:28.512 --> 02:07:29.312]  Does that answer your question?
[02:07:29.672 --> 02:07:30.292]  Hell yes!
[02:07:30.633 --> 02:07:32.633]  We can shut that border down now.
[02:07:33.133 --> 02:07:37.835]  Instead, the Border Patrol's down there as a nanny, as a facilitator to bring them in.
[02:07:37.855 --> 02:07:44.437]  I think that all makes sense.
[02:07:44.497 --> 02:07:45.938]  Let's hear from Phenomenology next.
[02:07:48.015 --> 02:07:49.896]  Hey there, hey everybody, hey Alex.
[02:07:49.996 --> 02:07:52.177]  This is super fun to be up here with you.
[02:07:52.197 --> 02:08:09.906]  I want to say quickly, before I make the point I was hoping to share, is that when I was a little girl my grandmother was a John Bircher and she took me Tuesday nights while she volunteered at the American Opinion Bookstore and she was always giving me pamphlets about the Trilateral Commission, globalism, the truth about the Kennedy's.
[02:08:09.946 --> 02:08:14.409]   So when I started listening to you, I was like, wow, like I know what this I know.
[02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:16.973]  And that was my grandfathers and my family.
[02:08:17.193 --> 02:08:18.015]  Weren't you blessed?
[02:08:18.415 --> 02:08:21.200]  The John Birch Society was... People say Alex Jones was right.
[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:24.124]  The John Birch Society nailed it 60 years ago.
[02:08:25.046 --> 02:08:26.947]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:08:27.047 --> 02:08:28.728]  So this is such a treat to be up here.
[02:08:28.768 --> 02:08:30.049]  Thank you for bringing me up.
[02:08:30.109 --> 02:08:30.870]  It's a true honor.
[02:08:31.230 --> 02:08:44.038]  I wanted to quickly talk about the fact that the new director for the United Nations International Organization on Migration is Amy Pope, who was the DHS advisor to Obama and then Biden.
[02:08:44.733 --> 02:08:55.776]  Now, when she was in the administration, she said that Trump's immigration policy was racist because we hadn't had any attacks since 9-11, and so she said that there was no chance of any terrorism.
[02:08:56.196 --> 02:09:04.378]  And what's so frightening is that the IOM states that they have solutions for people that are displaced because of climate change, so that's one.
[02:09:04.398 --> 02:09:07.879]  Oh yeah, viruses are attacking us because of climate change.
[02:09:07.919 --> 02:09:08.719]  No, they're made in labs.
[02:09:09.139 --> 02:09:11.159]  Oh, illegals are flooding us because of climate change.
[02:09:11.180 --> 02:09:12.940]  No, it's because you locked them down for years.
[02:09:14.526 --> 02:09:15.147]  Exactly.
[02:09:15.387 --> 02:09:22.895]  Well, the IOM has an operating budget for the last I could find was twenty twenty two and it was one point two billion.
[02:09:22.975 --> 02:09:24.958]  I'm trying to find how much of that is American money.
[02:09:24.998 --> 02:09:37.310]   But what I want to know is why do they need a brand manager and why was Amy Pope The leader, who is an American citizen, working to quote, promote safe, orderly, and regular migration.
[02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:39.813]  The whole thing, that's what I keep harping on.
[02:09:39.873 --> 02:09:45.739]  I watch the congressional hearings, and they point out the slave labor, and the sex slavery, and the hundreds of thousands of kids, and all of it.
[02:09:45.999 --> 02:09:48.441]  But never, why is the State Department funding most of it?
[02:09:49.122 --> 02:09:49.562]  Exactly.
[02:09:49.663 --> 02:09:50.904]  Cut the damn funding off.
[02:09:52.492 --> 02:09:54.534]  Yeah, and she's making this global tour, Alex.
[02:09:54.554 --> 02:09:55.695]  She just visited the Pope.
[02:09:56.175 --> 02:10:03.722]  She's like going all around, you know, this is an American citizen who's leading an organization that is destroying national sovereignty.
[02:10:04.282 --> 02:10:08.406]  And, you know, I just appreciate the ability to come up here and speak with you about it.
[02:10:08.486 --> 02:10:10.247]  I'm a little bit nervous, actually.
[02:10:10.307 --> 02:10:12.109]  Well, it's great to talk to you.
[02:10:12.129 --> 02:10:13.150]  You make amazing points.
[02:10:13.210 --> 02:10:16.332]  And isn't it great we have people like your grandmother that were aware of what was going on?
[02:10:16.673 --> 02:10:17.954]  Without them, we'd be dead in the water.
[02:10:19.449 --> 02:10:20.269]  Amen to that.
[02:10:20.349 --> 02:10:21.510]  Well, thank you so much, Alex.
[02:10:21.550 --> 02:10:22.030]  Thank you.
[02:10:22.530 --> 02:10:24.951]  That's why the Globals are so pissed, is we were waiting for them.
[02:10:25.531 --> 02:10:28.152]  I mean, I've been on air 30 years in April, folks.
[02:10:28.752 --> 02:10:30.212]  I'm 50 in two weeks.
[02:10:30.693 --> 02:10:31.393]  Less than two weeks.
[02:10:33.573 --> 02:10:37.595]  And I mean, we've been laying it out because we have their battle plan.
[02:10:38.015 --> 02:10:39.335]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[02:10:39.455 --> 02:10:40.036]  Who's up next?
[02:10:40.896 --> 02:10:42.556]  Let's hear from Jerome Davison.
[02:10:42.676 --> 02:10:44.697]  Jerome Davison is running for Congress in Arizona.
[02:10:44.737 --> 02:10:46.137]  He's been waiting to speak for a long time.
[02:10:46.157 --> 02:10:46.938]  Let's see if he's still there.
[02:10:46.998 --> 02:10:47.738]  Jerome, are you there?
[02:10:49.713 --> 02:10:50.614]  Hey, what's up, everybody?
[02:10:50.714 --> 02:10:52.515]  Alex Jones, happy 50th, my man.
[02:10:52.535 --> 02:10:53.076]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:53.096 --> 02:10:53.716]  Good to talk to you.
[02:10:55.017 --> 02:10:56.938]  Hey, welcome to X Spaces.
[02:10:57.018 --> 02:10:59.761]  All it took was $44 billion to get your free speech.
[02:11:00.021 --> 02:11:00.321]  Yeah.
[02:11:01.422 --> 02:11:03.904]  And all we needed was my Internet Bill of Rights.
[02:11:04.364 --> 02:11:05.745]  You know, we needed the Internet Bill of Rights.
[02:11:06.766 --> 02:11:10.949]  Isn't it crazy how history is repeating itself about the civil rights?
[02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:16.213]  It was the Democrats who wanted to keep black people in slavery, and the North wanted to cap us free.
[02:11:17.125 --> 02:11:20.908]  And so therefore the states came together and fought over slavery.
[02:11:21.789 --> 02:11:24.351]  Now the civil rights thing is coming over the border.
[02:11:25.252 --> 02:11:31.477]  And both of them ironically had human slavery involved in it, and money, and income.
[02:11:32.198 --> 02:11:42.627]  And I'm very upset that black people are not standing up against this stuff when we have cities like Chicago and California and New York City where black people are being put out on the streets for immigrants.
[02:11:43.493 --> 02:11:50.796]  It's like, you know, so Donald Trump can mistakenly say something, or they say he said something like, or such and such came from an S-hole country.
[02:11:51.617 --> 02:12:00.761]  But yet, your black people are being put out in cities like Chicago, and their football teams can't play, the high school can't play basketball, none of these things, and this does not upset the black community.
[02:12:00.781 --> 02:12:02.481]  By the way, take your time and explain.
[02:12:02.822 --> 02:12:12.826]  Whether it's Chicago, or Austin, Texas, or New York City, they're kicking the kids out of the field houses and the schools and saying, learn from school, the illegal aliens live here now.
[02:12:14.892 --> 02:12:15.132]  That's right.
[02:12:15.172 --> 02:12:16.072]  They're kicking them out of school.
[02:12:16.092 --> 02:12:17.653]  They can't play basketball.
[02:12:17.673 --> 02:12:19.413]  They can't go into the classroom.
[02:12:19.873 --> 02:12:24.054]  And by the way, for folks that don't know, in many of those communities, thank God for sports or I'd be dead.
[02:12:24.375 --> 02:12:25.355]  That's all these kids have.
[02:12:25.375 --> 02:12:27.055]  They don't have fathers at home, black or white.
[02:12:27.295 --> 02:12:29.116]  They need these sports.
[02:12:30.936 --> 02:12:32.117]  That's exact.
[02:12:32.137 --> 02:12:35.558]  Sports was my only therapy when my parents were going through a divorce.
[02:12:35.938 --> 02:12:37.218]  That was my only escape.
[02:12:38.161 --> 02:12:46.727]  And for these kids to be kicked out of sports, but first of all, they was kicking them out of sports with the LGBT and putting men in women's sports and ruining those young ladies' opportunities.
[02:12:46.747 --> 02:12:50.329]  And now California's trying to ban, now California's trying to ban football.
[02:12:52.150 --> 02:12:53.151]  They want to ban football.
[02:12:53.171 --> 02:12:53.611]  You know why?
[02:12:53.631 --> 02:12:54.852]  Because it's masculine.
[02:12:55.493 --> 02:12:56.413]  It's toxicity.
[02:12:56.773 --> 02:13:03.638]  And it's something for black kids and low minority kids to do to exercise all of that testicular energy.
[02:13:03.978 --> 02:13:04.719]  And to learn success.
[02:13:08.394 --> 02:13:08.935]  Absolutely.
[02:13:09.195 --> 02:13:10.456]  Lunch to six, that's where it's at.
[02:13:10.736 --> 02:13:13.059]  And these college players are coming in and making millions of dollars.
[02:13:13.159 --> 02:13:14.540]  Hey, you got five minutes, sir.
[02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:15.301]  Preach at him.
[02:13:15.341 --> 02:13:16.141]  Tell him what's going on.
[02:13:16.161 --> 02:13:17.443]  I want to get this guy on as a guest.
[02:13:17.483 --> 02:13:18.764]  He's damn good.
[02:13:19.665 --> 02:13:21.266]  Tell us what else is going on.
[02:13:22.728 --> 02:13:24.549]  Well, I'm going to be at the border for that.
[02:13:24.609 --> 02:13:25.650]  I'm going to be at the border.
[02:13:25.731 --> 02:13:28.153]  I think this is going to be a wonderful show of strength.
[02:13:28.823 --> 02:13:30.884]  We're not telling the government that we're there to fight.
[02:13:30.924 --> 02:13:33.785]  We're not telling them that this is going to be a Jan 6th hoax.
[02:13:34.145 --> 02:13:34.786]  None of that stuff.
[02:13:34.826 --> 02:13:38.127]  We're just showing them that we are Americans and we're concerned about our country.
[02:13:38.667 --> 02:13:39.868]  Our daughters are being raped.
[02:13:39.948 --> 02:13:41.589]  Our sons are being poisoned to death.
[02:13:41.929 --> 02:13:43.009]  It's enough of the crap.
[02:13:43.429 --> 02:13:44.590]  And here's another thing.
[02:13:45.110 --> 02:13:47.151]  I'm going to be down there with my Harley Davidson.
[02:13:47.171 --> 02:13:50.232]  I'm going to be down there showing people that I'm the America First candidate.
[02:13:50.292 --> 02:13:52.874]  I'm going to show the people that we deserve freedom.
[02:13:53.154 --> 02:13:55.855]  And if we don't stand up and fight right now, it's going to be over.
[02:13:56.511 --> 02:13:57.593]  These people are coming with it.
[02:13:57.894 --> 02:14:00.198]  They have the spirit of the Nephilim in them.
[02:14:00.679 --> 02:14:02.883]  They are evil and they hate humanity.
[02:14:03.596 --> 02:14:10.317]  I'm the only candidate in the United States that's fighting for the America First Agenda, that's fighting for a freedom of speech with the Internet Bill of Rights.
[02:14:10.717 --> 02:14:15.878]  I'm fighting against Bill Gates and his attack on farmlands and water and all these shots that he's given us.
[02:14:15.918 --> 02:14:16.839]  He's not even a doctor.
[02:14:16.879 --> 02:14:18.639]  He doesn't have a pharmaceutical degree.
[02:14:18.999 --> 02:14:24.860]  He's an evil, evil, rich man that wants to depopulate us, and I don't understand that.
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:25.640]  But here's another thing.
[02:14:26.081 --> 02:14:43.958]   I don't understand why Congress has not That's right, the Democrats, just like ObamaPhone, are using that as their political... I thought of that a month ago, I never said it on air.
[02:14:43.998 --> 02:14:44.899]  That's why I love calls.
[02:14:45.199 --> 02:14:46.821]  I love x-spaces.
[02:14:47.261 --> 02:14:49.823]  It's not even a call, whatever you call it, a digital transmission.
[02:14:50.924 --> 02:14:54.928]  Where's that database of the Democrats communicating with this horde of illegal aliens?
[02:14:56.921 --> 02:14:57.364]  Exactly.
[02:14:57.404 --> 02:14:59.277]  This is what they're going to use to steal the election.
[02:15:00.402 --> 02:15:04.625]  Why isn't Congress saying, hey, come on in here, we need the data.
[02:15:05.105 --> 02:15:07.986]  You know where they are, give me the cell phone numbers because we can use that too.
[02:15:08.067 --> 02:15:18.653]  If that's the way you're going to play the game, and if I worked hard and lift weights and did the running and did all the training, and you come in here and cheat and put, instead of having 11 men on the field, you got 15 men on the field, that's cheating.
[02:15:18.713 --> 02:15:22.795]  Okay, if that's the way the game is going to be played, I'm going to bring a couple more players onto the field.
[02:15:22.815 --> 02:15:23.656]  That's the way it's going to be.
[02:15:24.176 --> 02:15:27.658]  So if you want to have the numbers to the illegals, well then give us the numbers to them too.
[02:15:28.459 --> 02:15:30.881]  We need to text them and let them know where to go to vote for us.
[02:15:31.202 --> 02:15:45.255]  By the way, what do you make of a Democrat, I forget the name, in California and one in New York City, both Congress people, one a woman, one a man, just came out in the last month and said, yeah, we want illegal alias, we're going to get more congressional seats out of it.
[02:15:45.876 --> 02:15:52.783]  Even though they can't vote right away, in most cases they're still voting, they literally get more congressional blue seats out of it.
[02:15:54.628 --> 02:15:56.329]  Yeah, because they're using the numbers.
[02:15:56.609 --> 02:15:58.750]  They're using the census to get the seats out of it.
[02:15:59.931 --> 02:16:01.852]  I'm just totally upset with this stuff, man.
[02:16:01.912 --> 02:16:03.113]  Republicans are not fighting.
[02:16:03.533 --> 02:16:05.574]  We should have had this border closed a long time ago.
[02:16:05.634 --> 02:16:07.855]  And thank God that Abbott is doing this.
[02:16:07.876 --> 02:16:10.577]  By the way, Jerome, now that I see your picture, you've been on the show before.
[02:16:10.877 --> 02:16:12.558]  You put out that great Second Amendment ad.
[02:16:14.099 --> 02:16:17.121]  Yes, I did the McRaffles Great Again ad against the KKK.
[02:16:17.341 --> 02:16:17.901]  Well, good.
[02:16:17.941 --> 02:16:19.662]  Well, come back on my show this week.
[02:16:21.403 --> 02:16:22.264]  Oh, I'll come on, man.
[02:16:22.284 --> 02:16:22.604]  Gladly.
[02:16:23.729 --> 02:16:24.611]  All right, 60 seconds.
[02:16:24.651 --> 02:16:25.814]  Let me say 60 seconds.
[02:16:26.255 --> 02:16:27.418]  Yeah, close the comment.
[02:16:27.498 --> 02:16:29.462]  Okay, okay.
[02:16:30.445 --> 02:16:31.687]  I'm going to have a show of strength.
[02:16:31.748 --> 02:16:33.712]  I'm starting to come to Arizona movement.
[02:16:34.204 --> 02:16:38.967]  The only way we, everybody knows that this is the spiritual hub and political hub of the nations.
[02:16:39.227 --> 02:16:41.008]  As Arizona goes, so goes the nation.
[02:16:41.528 --> 02:16:50.013]  I want to show a show of strength by having people fly into this nation, fly into Arizona, knock doors with us and show great numbers and overcome their money.
[02:16:50.373 --> 02:16:54.455]  We can't overcome their money, but we can overcome their numbers with prayer and with people.
[02:16:56.316 --> 02:16:56.656]  I agree.
[02:16:56.696 --> 02:16:59.678]  What do you think, uh, gut level, what's going to happen to Trump?
[02:17:02.128 --> 02:17:03.289]  I believe Trump is going to be okay.
[02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:06.671]  As a matter of fact, I think he's going to get in, and we're going to turn this whole ship around.
[02:17:06.691 --> 02:17:11.235]  And this is why we need people like me in Congress to vote with his agenda and support his agenda.
[02:17:11.575 --> 02:17:15.918]  I don't see it being a revenge tour, and already he's already kind of turning the ship about he's not doing this.
[02:17:16.138 --> 02:17:19.721]  Well, I want him to take revenge, and I want him to do it in righteousness and with the law.
[02:17:20.081 --> 02:17:22.923]  But these people have earned a shot in prison.
[02:17:23.570 --> 02:17:25.891]  Because they have done a lot of things against this country.
[02:17:25.991 --> 02:17:27.051]  It's not about vengeance.
[02:17:27.131 --> 02:17:27.871]  It's about justice.
[02:17:27.891 --> 02:17:28.532]  They gotta pay.
[02:17:28.992 --> 02:17:29.872]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:17:29.912 --> 02:17:31.033]  How do people find your website?
[02:17:31.073 --> 02:17:31.953]  How do they find your website?
[02:17:33.213 --> 02:17:36.734]  Go to Jerome4Congress.com.
[02:17:37.115 --> 02:17:38.915]  Make a donation.
[02:17:39.215 --> 02:17:39.976]  Come to Arizona.
[02:17:39.996 --> 02:17:40.816]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:17:40.856 --> 02:17:41.416]  I love you, brother.
[02:17:41.796 --> 02:17:42.196]  Love you, too.
[02:17:42.236 --> 02:17:42.817]  We'll talk soon.
[02:17:42.837 --> 02:17:43.757]  I love that guy.
[02:17:43.777 --> 02:17:44.837]  I was like, wait, I know that voice.
[02:17:44.857 --> 02:17:46.418]  I was like, wait, I know him.
[02:17:47.358 --> 02:17:48.218]  He's been on the show before.
[02:17:48.638 --> 02:17:52.800]  He put out that great ad where the KKK comes to your house and you got the Second Amendment.
[02:17:55.964 --> 02:17:57.226]  This is the Democratic Party, by the way.
[02:17:57.246 --> 02:17:58.447]  You can't make this up.
[02:17:58.787 --> 02:18:03.273]  Man, it's so ridiculous, I can't even get my mind around it.
[02:18:04.254 --> 02:18:07.758]  Alright, let's keep tagging these great comments here.
[02:18:07.779 --> 02:18:08.800]  Who's up next?
[02:18:09.421 --> 02:18:10.161]  Let's hear from Lou.
[02:18:10.201 --> 02:18:11.503]  Lou's been waiting to speak for some time.
[02:18:11.743 --> 02:18:12.064]  Welcome!
[02:18:14.055 --> 02:18:15.576]  Hi, thank you so much.
[02:18:15.616 --> 02:18:16.237]  I appreciate it.
[02:18:16.657 --> 02:18:17.558]  A couple of things.
[02:18:17.598 --> 02:18:20.360]  Number one, I totally agree that you've been around for a while.
[02:18:20.940 --> 02:18:26.404]  I was actually given a business card for InfoWars back in like 2009 in Vegas.
[02:18:26.504 --> 02:18:27.965]  Beautiful.
[02:18:28.045 --> 02:18:31.748]  So you have been around and we appreciate you so much and your voice.
[02:18:32.849 --> 02:18:36.732]  The thing that I wanted to talk about was the national security risk at the border.
[02:18:37.173 --> 02:18:48.063]  So we're seeing Texas do their border showdown, which I am really happy Abbott has, you know, kind of defied what Biden administration is wanting to do.
[02:18:48.143 --> 02:18:54.469]  But the thing that we're finding is the folks that are coming over aren't the folks that we're used to seeing, right?
[02:18:54.849 --> 02:18:57.772]  Like, you know, the people who are coming over with their kids and things like that.
[02:18:58.232 --> 02:19:08.103]  If you focus on Lukeville, Arizona, and again, another Arizonan up here, you will see that there are some terrifying people coming across the border.
[02:19:08.123 --> 02:19:10.426]  They're praying to Mecca at our border.
[02:19:10.546 --> 02:19:17.714]  Oh no, you got whole armed groups of Islamists coming across, bragging to camera, you don't know who I am, you'll soon find out, infidel!
[02:19:20.775 --> 02:19:21.436]  Absolutely.
[02:19:21.576 --> 02:19:23.918]  And you know, I think that that is a main focus.
[02:19:24.278 --> 02:19:37.389]  And then I just retweeted out of Chicago, they've identified the fact that the Biden administration has spent $1 billion on immigrants in the Chicago area and are fixing $2 billion.
[02:19:37.409 --> 02:19:37.709]  Oh, no, no, no.
[02:19:37.749 --> 02:19:38.790]  Let me show you a document.
[02:19:38.830 --> 02:19:39.671]  Let me show you a document.
[02:19:40.151 --> 02:19:43.253]  This is a congressional report out late last year.
[02:19:43.714 --> 02:19:46.816]  Historic dollar cost DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
[02:19:47.798 --> 02:19:48.460]  November 13, 2023.
[02:19:49.223 --> 02:19:53.300]  It's 400 plus billion dollars is what it's costing.
[02:19:54.993 --> 02:19:57.155]  400 plus million.
[02:19:57.596 --> 02:20:05.443]  But just in Chicago, they are courting what they are calling the new Americans or the new citizens for that voter block.
[02:20:05.843 --> 02:20:08.305]  And they've spent $1 billion in Chicago.
[02:20:08.666 --> 02:20:12.429]  And they're building, you know, housing and everything up there.
[02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:18.415]  I mean, I really feel like this is the moment that we can unite as Americans to fight back against this.
[02:20:18.995 --> 02:20:20.838]  And, you know, what do we do?
[02:20:21.839 --> 02:20:27.767]  What is your recommendation for us to try to unify behind this issue of this invasion?
[02:20:28.883 --> 02:20:32.006]  I mean, I think we're doing a show right now that's going to reach millions of people.
[02:20:32.667 --> 02:20:34.828]  And we've already reached probably 600, 700,000 in the last couple of hours.
[02:20:34.849 --> 02:20:36.690]  It's going to be millions when it's done.
[02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:39.533]  And we just, every little bit helps, every little victory.
[02:20:40.013 --> 02:20:40.894]  And we just pray to God.
[02:20:40.954 --> 02:20:41.715]  We move forward.
[02:20:41.755 --> 02:20:42.916]  We don't hate the illegal aliens.
[02:20:42.936 --> 02:20:44.177]  We know they're a weapon being used.
[02:20:44.717 --> 02:20:45.678]  And we just keep pointing it out.
[02:20:45.698 --> 02:20:50.883]  We don't want to end up being a fossil like this prehistoric crocodile from 35 million years ago.
[02:20:51.263 --> 02:20:53.565]  We don't want humans to become something that destroy ourselves.
[02:20:54.086 --> 02:20:55.027]  We've got to stand together.
[02:20:57.424 --> 02:20:58.125]  Absolutely.
[02:20:58.345 --> 02:21:03.568]  And if I can do one other thing, I just want to plug somebody who's been on the border for seven weeks.
[02:21:04.228 --> 02:21:06.890]  It is at Liberty underscore Clarion.
[02:21:07.791 --> 02:21:16.356]  He has seven weeks of video coming out of Lukeville, watching all of these immigrants come across, how they behave, how they've treated our border agents.
[02:21:17.256 --> 02:21:20.537]  It is some scary stuff, and I would recommend everybody watch that.
[02:21:20.917 --> 02:21:24.478]  And also, you know, follow him and follow our friend Hernando.
[02:21:24.838 --> 02:21:26.979]  He has done such an amazing job as well.
[02:21:27.039 --> 02:21:28.319]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:21:28.339 --> 02:21:29.560]  Oh, no, don't thank me.
[02:21:29.580 --> 02:21:31.020]  Thank you.
[02:21:31.260 --> 02:21:34.421]  And the reason I say don't thank me is I'm just like you on freedom.
[02:21:35.141 --> 02:21:35.861]  Here's a short clip.
[02:21:35.901 --> 02:21:37.402]  I'll go back to the comments.
[02:21:38.530 --> 02:21:43.711]  An insane deep state run Democrats have planned for civil war, which they're pushing all over the news.
[02:21:43.751 --> 02:21:44.651]  But remember what they did?
[02:21:45.172 --> 02:21:47.312]  For just a few hundred people, they waved to the Capitol.
[02:21:47.612 --> 02:21:54.734]  They put up razor wire and barbed wire and put DC under martial law for six months and put the country under for years with lockdown.
[02:21:55.114 --> 02:21:56.894]  So we know who wants to bring martial law.
[02:21:57.295 --> 02:21:58.415]  It's not President Trump.
[02:21:59.015 --> 02:22:00.055]  Thank you so much, caller.
[02:22:00.555 --> 02:22:05.777]  I'm calling a caller because it's not a technical caller, but it's an ex-spacer.
[02:22:06.537 --> 02:22:06.817]  All right.
[02:22:06.897 --> 02:22:07.457]  Who's up next?
[02:22:08.223 --> 02:22:09.803]  Let's hear from the Nick Vertucci Show.
[02:22:10.224 --> 02:22:10.744]  What's up, Nick?
[02:22:12.344 --> 02:22:13.344]  How you guys doing, Chase?
[02:22:13.724 --> 02:22:18.926]  Alex, hey guys, thank you for doing what you guys do and having the balls to do it and taking the heat.
[02:22:19.146 --> 02:22:20.626]  We really appreciate it out here.
[02:22:20.646 --> 02:22:21.807]  I know you don't hear that all the time.
[02:22:23.207 --> 02:22:30.649]  Alex, can I ask you one question that is not on this subject that I am dying to know your opinion on?
[02:22:31.870 --> 02:22:32.611]  I appreciate it.
[02:22:33.091 --> 02:22:46.947]  So, we know, for me, the last two or three years, you know, I've been watching what the path for Trump would be back to the office, and of course we know all about Q, we know all about Juan Jose, and all those guys.
[02:22:47.007 --> 02:22:47.988]  Here's my question to you.
[02:22:48.448 --> 02:22:51.831]  There's a new fellow out here and I know you know of him.
[02:22:51.851 --> 02:23:03.080]  His name is Michael Gill and he's talking about some crazy stuff about some people inside Trump's camp like Flynn and a bunch of other people that are working against him for the presidency.
[02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:08.604]  Do you know anything, and he's even mentioned you, and about the Pandora's box and having all this information.
[02:23:08.624 --> 02:23:12.688]  Do you know anything about that or have an opinion on what he's putting out?
[02:23:13.513 --> 02:23:15.035]  Yeah, you said I know who he is.
[02:23:15.055 --> 02:23:20.482]  I mean, I may have a bunch of crew that puts a post all day on X. I don't know who that is.
[02:23:20.522 --> 02:23:21.364]  I've never heard of that.
[02:23:22.145 --> 02:23:24.227]  General Flynn, in my view, is 100% real.
[02:23:25.249 --> 02:23:26.470]  And all he's doing is backing Trump.
[02:23:27.912 --> 02:23:36.713]   So I mean, I could easily go on X Today and accuse somebody of something and have a big controversy out of it.
[02:23:37.153 --> 02:23:37.873]  I just don't do that.
[02:23:38.473 --> 02:23:40.234]  And evil's not as powerful as you think.
[02:23:40.254 --> 02:23:41.374]  There's a lot of good people, too.
[02:23:42.074 --> 02:23:48.776]  So I don't know about the particular group you're talking about, or Mr. Gill, or Pandora's Box, or whatever that means.
[02:23:49.696 --> 02:23:52.437]  I mean, I'm here just promoting freedom, and so that's what I'm doing.
[02:23:52.737 --> 02:23:52.937]  Yeah.
[02:23:53.518 --> 02:23:58.802]  Well, no, and I apologize to take it off the track of what you're talking about.
[02:23:58.862 --> 02:23:59.442]  No, I don't mind.
[02:23:59.462 --> 02:24:00.363]  I love all these questions.
[02:24:00.463 --> 02:24:01.224]  I just, you know...
[02:24:02.549 --> 02:24:13.775]  Well, if you get a chance and maybe you're not interested and you go to Rumble, I mean, this guy's out there and he has some very good credentials about who he is and who he's connected to.
[02:24:15.116 --> 02:24:36.567]   Maybe it's something you just want to, you know, because like I said, all this stuff has been going on for years now with Juan Osevan and Q and none of this stuff is transpiring and he's kind of given a case of why that isn't happening and that Juan has been, you know, on the other side and again, Yeah, but listen, listen, this all becomes, I appreciate you calling it, but let me just say this.
[02:24:40.467 --> 02:24:45.388]  I don't work for any intelligence agency and nobody tells me what to do, okay?
[02:24:45.588 --> 02:24:47.649]  And I do my own research every day, I do my own show.
[02:24:48.409 --> 02:24:55.210]  And it's insulting to act like intelligence agencies have all this power.
[02:24:55.970 --> 02:25:00.531]  They've got all this data and they've got all this money, but where the people go, they go.
[02:25:02.378 --> 02:25:09.387]  And so we want to think of people in government as magical, and they're not.
[02:25:10.388 --> 02:25:11.289]  I am self-made.
[02:25:12.511 --> 02:25:14.513]  Promoting freedom, other people agreeing, we did this.
[02:25:17.930 --> 02:25:26.774]  You know, I don't, the whole Q thing becomes a religion and then it says this and it takes credit for all the people exposing stuff and it's just, it's a big quagmire.
[02:25:27.514 --> 02:25:30.596]  And then all the people that fight it and all of it, it's just a big quagmire.
[02:25:31.196 --> 02:25:33.997]  Go to the border, videotape everybody.
[02:25:35.278 --> 02:25:43.742]  If we put enough people down there, all over the Texas border, Arizona border, California border, they're not going to be able to stage something.
[02:25:45.063 --> 02:25:46.565]  Because they know you're there taping them.
[02:25:46.885 --> 02:25:47.866]  And you know you're good.
[02:25:48.187 --> 02:25:48.887]  I know I'm good.
[02:25:49.408 --> 02:25:54.253]  So the last thing the feds want is go to the border, be peaceful, document everything.
[02:25:54.334 --> 02:25:55.515]  They don't want our people down there.
[02:25:57.477 --> 02:25:59.700]  So, activate yourself.
[02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:00.801]  You know you love God.
[02:26:00.881 --> 02:26:01.902]  You know you love your family.
[02:26:01.942 --> 02:26:02.863]  You know you love America.
[02:26:03.224 --> 02:26:04.185]  You know you love the truth.
[02:26:05.427 --> 02:26:09.568]  And then just do your own show on X. Maybe you reach 100 people.
[02:26:09.608 --> 02:26:10.029]  Maybe you reach 10,000.
[02:26:10.069 --> 02:26:11.789]  Maybe you reach a million.
[02:26:12.049 --> 02:26:15.631]  A lot of you will do a show or post tweets and get nothing for a while.
[02:26:15.671 --> 02:26:16.791]  All of a sudden you'll have a million people.
[02:26:17.351 --> 02:26:18.051]  Just do it.
[02:26:18.311 --> 02:26:19.212]  You know you're good.
[02:26:20.069 --> 02:26:23.331]  So you use the Holy Spirit and get out there and do stuff.
[02:26:23.631 --> 02:26:26.492]  What they want is paranoia.
[02:26:27.212 --> 02:26:28.393]  There's more of us than them.
[02:26:28.813 --> 02:26:32.015]  Now at a big event like the border, you go down there because that's where they're going to make their move.
[02:26:32.395 --> 02:26:38.898]  But in general, you go to a city council, you go to a school board, it's going to be you and no evil people.
[02:26:39.298 --> 02:26:40.959]  I mean, there'll be an evil person on the board.
[02:26:42.827 --> 02:26:48.229]  You'll be up there speaking, it'll be on TV, other parents will hear it, and you'll probably get no opposition.
[02:26:48.529 --> 02:26:56.331]  Now, if you get 20 parents to come down the next month, there might be a few operatives trying to start a fight with you, you know, by the bathroom or something or by the front door.
[02:26:56.811 --> 02:26:58.672]  But they're pathetic people.
[02:26:59.152 --> 02:27:10.610]   Their power, as Thomas Jefferson was asked by a newspaper reporter, you can pull this up, right when the country was founded, he said, He was asked, what is the level of which tyranny will take us?
[02:27:10.650 --> 02:27:11.651]  What is the limit of tyranny?
[02:27:12.211 --> 02:27:16.053]  And he said, the limit of tyranny is what good men and women will put up with.
[02:27:19.674 --> 02:27:21.495]  So, it's that simple.
[02:27:22.756 --> 02:27:42.122]   And if I'm just a regular guy, that got on AXS TV 29 years ago, and got on local radio 28 years ago, and got syndicated 27 years ago on a small network, Imagine what you can do.
[02:27:43.703 --> 02:27:48.707]  There's not magical powers given to the globalists, except the magical powers we give them.
[02:27:49.207 --> 02:27:52.570]  The only power they have is us believing they're all powerful.
[02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:53.070]  They're not.
[02:27:53.090 --> 02:27:54.271]  All right, who's up next?
[02:27:56.252 --> 02:27:58.054]  Let's hear next from the emergent perspective.
[02:28:00.255 --> 02:28:01.536]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:28:02.037 --> 02:28:02.337]  Welcome.
[02:28:04.002 --> 02:28:05.484]  Okay, so I've got a couple things.
[02:28:05.684 --> 02:28:15.718]  I've been involved in the conservative libertarian movement, going all the way back to Ron Paul's 2012 campaign and prior, and kind of seeing all the things that the RNC did to him.
[02:28:16.239 --> 02:28:17.401]  And just something occurred to me.
[02:28:17.501 --> 02:28:19.343]  Some of my friends, particularly in...
[02:28:20.430 --> 02:28:30.256]  The NRX community recently have come out with kind of an interesting intellectual tool reflecting on so many of these wins that we've had over the last 10, 12 plus years.
[02:28:30.816 --> 02:28:41.643]  And so much of it involves getting past the point in the debate where there's a corrupt system in place and we're debating whether the intentions of the system are good or not.
[02:28:41.923 --> 02:28:51.387]   But when we finally blow past that and get to the point where we're just calling it what it is, That's the point where all the support and all the legitimacy falls out of it.
[02:28:51.507 --> 02:28:59.409]  And I think the more we can kind of use that tool, so that it's actually an old engineering acronym, OzzyWid, or purpose of the system is what it does.
[02:29:00.129 --> 02:29:03.810]  So if somebody tries to debate that, oh, well, this or that thing is a good system.
[02:29:03.870 --> 02:29:06.931]  Communism has really got good intentions or money printing is good.
[02:29:07.171 --> 02:29:10.332]  You just say, look, communism starves people and it centralizes power.
[02:29:10.592 --> 02:29:10.952]  Exactly.
[02:29:10.992 --> 02:29:18.276]  You cut through all the subgroups and cliques and junior high stuff and say, I oppose the WEF-UN agenda.
[02:29:18.936 --> 02:29:20.877]  I oppose the open border program.
[02:29:21.357 --> 02:29:23.498]  I oppose war with Russia.
[02:29:23.818 --> 02:29:24.319]  Exactly.
[02:29:24.639 --> 02:29:25.699]  It's about policy.
[02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:31.322]  I want to cut the State Department funding to shut down the UN camps on our border that run this.
[02:29:31.702 --> 02:29:33.383]  But Congress still won't debate that.
[02:29:35.171 --> 02:29:35.792]  Absolutely.
[02:29:36.152 --> 02:29:41.797]  You know, and I mean, look at, I mean, the latest, two of the latest examples, I think, are corporate media and DEI.
[02:29:41.837 --> 02:29:48.462]  And when we finally cut through the point where every, we've got half of America just saying, corporate media is only there to lie to you.
[02:29:48.482 --> 02:29:49.864]  Look how fast they're collapsing.
[02:29:50.584 --> 02:29:52.045]  Well, that's a whole other narrative.
[02:29:52.585 --> 02:29:58.326]  The globalist system collapses its own system, and all the corporate media is zombie.
[02:29:58.587 --> 02:30:00.047]  None of it's made money in 20 years.
[02:30:00.607 --> 02:30:06.349]  And now they're done even funding their zombie operation, which shows they're failing, we're winning.
[02:30:06.709 --> 02:30:07.929]  That is not rhetoric, folks.
[02:30:07.969 --> 02:30:08.890]  That is real.
[02:30:09.770 --> 02:30:15.031]  And they're going purely to violence, purely to clandestine black ops now, because we're winning.
[02:30:15.351 --> 02:30:22.913]  So people have to get ready to see the Tucker Carlson's, who's been good for 10 years awake, come over to us, the Joe Rogans, the Elon Musk.
[02:30:23.333 --> 02:30:29.355]  We've got to be ready to see that freedom is popular and people, you know, shouldn't completely trust in Elon Musk or whatever.
[02:30:29.375 --> 02:30:31.495]  But the point is, they're coming over to our side.
[02:30:31.515 --> 02:30:33.656]  We should realize freedom's sexy, folks.
[02:30:37.768 --> 02:30:38.408]  Totally agree.
[02:30:39.429 --> 02:30:48.114]  And I think the other one is DEI and how, you know, people say, oh, well, it's a well-intentioned, it's really weaponized compassion.
[02:30:48.534 --> 02:30:53.016]  And the real purpose of it is it's the exact same as political commissars in the Soviet Union.
[02:30:53.477 --> 02:30:56.038]  It inserts forced ideology into the workplace.
[02:30:56.518 --> 02:31:03.621]   And it's basically inserting a reason for government and NGOs to exert No, no, no, exactly.
[02:31:03.661 --> 02:31:15.990]  All of this critical race theory and all of the ESG, corporate governance, liberal crap is to say, will they accept being penalized for their political views if we say it's anti-racist?
[02:31:16.330 --> 02:31:21.054]  And once we accept that they have the authority to do that and have a digital token to do it, it's game over.
[02:31:23.121 --> 02:31:23.922]  Oh, totally agree.
[02:31:24.502 --> 02:31:33.330]  And the last thing I wanted to say is I think especially the Trump lawsuit really kind of highlights this for a lot of people.
[02:31:33.350 --> 02:31:38.715]  It was a breaking point because conservatives have been arguing for so long, well, you know, the law protects me.
[02:31:38.855 --> 02:31:43.159]  And I think this is the point where we realize the law doesn't protect you.
[02:31:43.779 --> 02:31:47.824]  It's fair and just people honoring the law is what protects you.
[02:31:48.185 --> 02:31:58.677]  And when fair and just people are forced out of power and legitimacy, those people that are left there, no piece of paper ever stopped a tyrant who was determined to abuse that.
[02:31:59.284 --> 02:31:59.764]  That's right.
[02:31:59.804 --> 02:32:01.145]  Well, that's a good place to end it.
[02:32:01.185 --> 02:32:02.706]  Sorry to everybody else we can't get to.
[02:32:03.247 --> 02:32:07.229]  We just did two and a half hours live on X Spaces.
[02:32:07.950 --> 02:32:10.511]  I'll be back, Lord willing, tomorrow, 4 p.m.
[02:32:10.631 --> 02:32:11.652]  Central, 5 p.m.
[02:32:11.712 --> 02:32:12.853]  Eastern, 3 p.m.

[02:32:13.753 --> 02:32:21.458]  Pacific, at InfoWars.com forward slash show, and stations across the country, InfoWars.com forward slash show, and we stream it out while we're still able to.
[02:32:21.478 --> 02:32:22.199]  Don't take it for granted.
[02:32:22.939 --> 02:32:27.104]  On Real Alex Jones on X. I want to thank the listeners and I want to thank the viewers.

[02:32:31.684 --> 02:32:36.707]  I got a lot of news I didn't hit, but I'll be hitting this tomorrow night at 4 p.m.
[02:32:36.987 --> 02:32:40.430]  Central on just how crazy the establishment is.
[02:32:40.530 --> 02:32:44.492]  Please remember, the forbidden show they don't want you to hear is weekdays, 11 a.m.
[02:32:44.512 --> 02:32:45.053]  to 3 p.m.
[02:32:45.073 --> 02:32:45.593]  That's mine.
[02:32:46.013 --> 02:32:49.235]  Other great shows, Harrison Smith with American Journal, 8 a.m.
[02:32:49.255 --> 02:32:51.317]  weekdays, InfoWars.com forward slash show.

[02:33:05.946 --> 02:33:07.327]  Please get a copy of my book.
[02:33:07.407 --> 02:33:08.308]  It's all fundraisers.
[02:33:08.348 --> 02:33:08.968]  Keep us on air.
[02:33:09.408 --> 02:33:14.732]  Signed or unsigned, The Great Awakening, The Plan to Defeat the Globalists and Launch the Next Great Renaissance.
[02:33:15.232 --> 02:33:17.253]  All of it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:33:17.594 --> 02:33:23.798]  But I wanted to end this live Spaces transmission because I had Viva Frye, the great lawyer, on earlier.
[02:33:24.318 --> 02:33:30.641]  with his amazing analysis last night of this weaponized judiciary and now it's a threat to us all.
[02:33:30.961 --> 02:33:38.045]  We'll end with this, then we'll restream it at InfoWars.com forward slash show and on X at Alex Jones until 4 p.m.
[02:33:38.445 --> 02:33:39.845]  Central tomorrow.
[02:33:40.166 --> 02:33:41.286]  Thank you all so much.
[02:33:41.606 --> 02:33:42.747]  God bless and good luck.
[02:33:43.047 --> 02:33:47.009]  All right, I wasn't going to do a vlog today, but the news broke.
[02:33:47.309 --> 02:33:55.976]   The verdict in the E. Jean Carroll second defamation case If anybody thinks this is justice, you are idiots, pure and simple.
[02:33:56.016 --> 02:34:01.041]  If anybody likes this just because of the political consequences, you are scoundrels, pure and simple.
[02:34:01.661 --> 02:34:10.630]  E. Jean Carroll, the woman who is, in my humble view, batshit crazy, names her cat after a venereal disease, Vagina T Fireball.
[02:34:11.371 --> 02:34:14.473]  Would you consider bringing a rape charge against Donald Trump for this?
[02:34:14.513 --> 02:34:14.553]  No.
[02:34:14.372 --> 02:34:19.813]   and a half decades ago has no physical evidence of it, says that she would not file charges
[02:34:19.813 --> 02:34:25.032]   for the assault because when you listen to her justification it's going to blow your
[02:34:25.032 --> 02:34:27.772]   mind and you're going to realize you're dealing with a crazy person.
[02:34:27.772 --> 02:34:32.372]   Would you consider bringing a rape charge against Donald Trump for this?
[02:34:32.372 --> 02:34:33.372]  Why not?
[02:34:33.372 --> 02:34:39.012]   I would find it disrespectful to the women who are down on the border who are being raped
[02:34:39.012 --> 02:34:40.252]  around the clock down there.
[02:34:40.293 --> 02:35:03.225]   But for the women down there, and for the women, actually, around the world... Says she's not going to file criminal charges, but sues Donald Trump civilly in New York, possibly one of the most corrupt jurisdictions in the world, wins in the first trial, and then sues for defamation in the second trial because Trump took to Truth Social to post how she's Crazy!
[02:35:03.646 --> 02:35:07.648]  How he never met her before, how the story is a total lie, and she sues him for defamation again.
[02:35:07.668 --> 02:35:25.320]  Oh yeah, I forgot to say, after the first jury found that Trump did not rape her in the Bergdorf changing room two and a half decades ago, but sexually assaulted her, such that when he denied it, it was defamation and awarded her damages for the alleged assault and the defamation.
[02:35:25.500 --> 02:35:28.682]  And then she sued him a second time when he continued to deny it and protest his innocence.
[02:35:29.262 --> 02:35:29.963]  They had a trial.
[02:35:30.783 --> 02:35:37.125]  And when I say that the mainstream media is the enemy of the people, it's only because they are the enemy of the people.
[02:35:37.185 --> 02:35:47.548]  He had a trial in which the guilt was already a foregone conclusion and quite literally the trial was only to adjudicate on how much he would have to pay her and that amount came down today.
[02:35:47.568 --> 02:35:53.490]   But before we get there, NBC News was reporting that Trump testified And he testified briefly.
[02:35:53.530 --> 02:35:56.931]  The headline reads, Trump testifies briefly in the trial.
[02:35:57.351 --> 02:36:06.334]  And then it's only when you go into the article and read why he testified briefly that you realize the system is corrupt, the media is corrupt, and they are the enemy of the people.
[02:36:06.574 --> 02:36:12.636]  He testified briefly because the judge largely restricted what Trump could say in his own defense in court.
[02:36:12.796 --> 02:36:42.702]   So you head into a trial in which your guilt is already determined, only to adjudicate on the damage, in which you are limited in what you can say in your own defense, in which the judge literally says you cannot say certain things, include protesting your innocence, and then you come down with a jury verdict, and oh my goodness, watching a journalist from NBC News, in real time, waiting for the news, announcing the news with orgiastic glee, Like, the winning lottery numbers of this political lottery just came down, and she's reading it in real time.
[02:36:42.722 --> 02:36:49.123]  $83.3 million awarded to bats**t crazy, E. Jean Carroll.
[02:36:49.223 --> 02:36:51.804]  I think it's like 7.5 million compensatory damages.
[02:36:52.444 --> 02:36:56.225]  $11 million to, like, this, uh, defamation rehabilitation program.
[02:36:56.245 --> 02:36:57.265]  I don't know what that is exactly.
[02:36:57.825 --> 02:37:04.387]  And $65 million in punitive damages, which, from what I understand, would survive bankruptcy.
[02:37:04.427 --> 02:37:05.907]  Not that Trump's gonna go bankrupt anyhow.
[02:37:06.167 --> 02:37:09.870]  Not that I think these judgment verdicts are going to stand after appeal.
[02:37:10.090 --> 02:37:12.272]  In any event, $83.3 million.
[02:37:12.652 --> 02:37:18.537]  This NBC journalist is like, oh, that's not as much as they wanted, but nothing to, what did she say, bad enough?
[02:37:18.717 --> 02:37:19.437]  I forget what she said.
[02:37:19.638 --> 02:37:20.378]  It's idiotic.
[02:37:20.518 --> 02:37:21.379]  You just got to watch it.
[02:37:21.539 --> 02:37:22.359]  We do have a verdict.
[02:37:22.900 --> 02:37:30.083]  Eugene Carroll did suffer more than nominal damages as a result of Mr. Trump's publication of these two June 2019 statements.
[02:37:30.424 --> 02:37:35.986]  The first amount for compensatory damages for her emotional pain and anguish is $7.3 million.
[02:37:36.487 --> 02:37:43.010]  The amount for the compensatory damages for the reputation repair program is $11 million.
[02:37:43.050 --> 02:37:48.233]  We're now moving on to the questions about whether Trump acted with malice.
[02:37:48.293 --> 02:37:55.237]   Remember, Vote questions have to be answered in the affirmative to get to a question of punitive damages.
[02:37:56.138 --> 02:37:57.779]  We are still waiting for that answer.
[02:37:57.799 --> 02:37:59.660]  As you wait for those answers.
[02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:00.941]  Mr. Trump acted with malice.
[02:38:01.081 --> 02:38:01.441]  I'm sorry.
[02:38:01.461 --> 02:38:05.104]  Mr. Trump acted with malice in making the first of those statements.
[02:38:05.624 --> 02:38:09.467]  That's the June 21st, 2019 statement at 517 p.m.
[02:38:09.507 --> 02:38:11.348]  in which he denied it for the first time.
[02:38:12.028 --> 02:38:16.451]  And similarly, we are waiting to hear whether and making that yes.
[02:38:20.054 --> 02:38:27.838]  In June 22, 2019, he did also act maliciously or out of hatred or ill will in defaming her on that day.
[02:38:27.858 --> 02:38:32.141]  And here comes the punitive damages award of $65 million, Alicia.
[02:38:32.341 --> 02:38:32.781]  Yes!
[02:38:37.444 --> 02:38:50.687]  So $65 million in punitives, $11 million in the reputation repair program, and $7.3 million in reputation, I'm sorry, in the emotional harm for a total of $83.3 million.
[02:38:51.107 --> 02:38:53.287]  That's a high eight-figure award.
[02:38:53.607 --> 02:38:57.228]  I had predicted we'd be high eight figures or early $100 million.
[02:38:57.488 --> 02:38:59.869]  Certainly less money, I think, that E.G.
[02:39:00.369 --> 02:39:01.729]  Carroll's lawyers had hoped.
[02:39:01.788 --> 02:39:05.468]  But $83.3 million is nothing to sneeze up.
[02:39:05.468 --> 02:39:09.308]  [SIGH]
[02:39:09.308 --> 02:39:14.668]   And people take to Twitter to rejoice in this decision, to celebrate in this verdict.
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:23.406]  You've got Jen Psaki, who was once upon a time literally the propagandist for the government, now turned MSM, propagandist mouthpiece for the government, saying, oh my goodness, this is justice.
[02:39:23.566 --> 02:39:24.827]  The only question is going to be, I don't know.
[02:39:25.147 --> 02:39:25.847]  It's idiotic.
[02:39:25.967 --> 02:39:27.108]  You can see the tweets for yourselves.
[02:39:27.408 --> 02:39:30.170]  People rejoicing in this are scoundrels or morons.
[02:39:30.390 --> 02:39:31.331]  Pure and simple.
[02:39:31.491 --> 02:39:37.115]  This is literally kangaroo court banana republic level madness, where they can find a batshit crazy person.
[02:39:37.155 --> 02:39:40.698]  And by the way, everybody in the media knows that she's batshit crazy.
[02:39:40.878 --> 02:39:44.681]  I'll play to you a compilation, a montage, put together by Gravian.
[02:39:45.041 --> 02:39:50.004]  Everybody knows this woman is batshit crazy, but she's an easy tool for the media to exploit.
[02:39:50.265 --> 02:39:50.965]  Anderson Cooper!
[02:39:51.345 --> 02:39:55.749]  I dare Anderson Cooper not to say publicly he thinks this woman is crazier than a loon.
[02:39:56.369 --> 02:39:57.769]  And it was all fairly playful.
[02:39:58.530 --> 02:39:59.830]  Oh, it was charming.
[02:40:00.110 --> 02:40:00.870]  It was exciting.
[02:40:00.910 --> 02:40:03.611]  Remember what Donald Trump was like in 95, 96?
[02:40:04.692 --> 02:40:08.693]  On the counter were these fancy lingerie boxes that they used to have back in the 90s.
[02:40:08.793 --> 02:40:09.393]  Yeah.
[02:40:10.053 --> 02:40:12.054]  You wore lingerie in the 90s, I'll bet, Joy.
[02:40:12.534 --> 02:40:14.094]  He didn't suggest it, he shouted it.
[02:40:14.315 --> 02:40:14.795]  He shouted what?
[02:40:14.815 --> 02:40:15.235]  Lingerie.
[02:40:15.595 --> 02:40:16.255]  Lingerie.
[02:40:16.415 --> 02:40:17.936]  He may have shouted underwear.
[02:40:18.536 --> 02:40:18.876]  Yeah.
[02:40:18.976 --> 02:40:19.236]  Okay.
[02:40:19.316 --> 02:40:20.056]  Were you scared?
[02:40:20.116 --> 02:40:21.357]  Were you angry?
[02:40:21.517 --> 02:40:23.017]  No, I was too panicked to be scared.
[02:40:24.198 --> 02:40:25.378]  Too panicked to be scared, okay.
[02:40:25.785 --> 02:40:27.486]  Totally, and I put my life on the line.
[02:40:27.506 --> 02:40:29.507]  Do you think that you're going... Well, hold on a second.
[02:40:29.867 --> 02:40:31.188]  What do you mean you put your life on the line?
[02:40:31.428 --> 02:40:34.329]  Well, people have told me I have to be careful.
[02:40:34.909 --> 02:40:35.790]  You've gotten death threats.
[02:40:36.750 --> 02:40:38.091]  I am not looking at death threats.
[02:40:38.451 --> 02:40:45.214]  I had the idea that I'm going to make him put it on over his pants.
[02:40:46.014 --> 02:40:46.915]  That was my idea.
[02:40:47.719 --> 02:40:50.402]  You see how funny that would be to make him put that on?
[02:40:50.663 --> 02:40:54.908]  I guess my question is, could there be any DNA on there?
[02:40:54.928 --> 02:40:56.109]  I have no idea.
[02:40:56.309 --> 02:40:59.513]  I do not know if the president ejaculated.
[02:40:59.533 --> 02:41:00.534]  I have no idea.
[02:41:00.875 --> 02:41:09.042]   Lawrence, I wish I had said, I wish I said, I'll tell you my age if you show me your tax returns.
[02:41:09.262 --> 02:41:11.624]  Yeah, it would have been helpful.
[02:41:12.004 --> 02:41:15.066]  So I'm holding my handbag like that.
[02:41:15.226 --> 02:41:19.989]  The only reason I know I'm holding my handbag is because I discovered it when I got to the street.
[02:41:20.290 --> 02:41:24.372]  The statement that he said, which he's just made, which is she's not my type number one.
[02:41:24.392 --> 02:41:25.353]  That was the number one thing.
[02:41:25.373 --> 02:41:26.734]  I love that I'm not his type.
[02:41:27.154 --> 02:41:27.755]  I'm an archer.
[02:41:27.815 --> 02:41:29.096]  I have bows and arrows, you know.
[02:41:29.796 --> 02:41:30.477]  Yeah, fine.
[02:41:30.957 --> 02:41:32.619]  I think there's just too... Never mind.
[02:41:33.060 --> 02:41:33.400]  Never mind.
[02:41:33.460 --> 02:41:37.965]  I think most people think of rape as a... I mean, it is a violent assault.
[02:41:38.005 --> 02:41:40.888]  It is not a... I think most people think of rape as being sexy.
[02:41:42.609 --> 02:41:43.290]  Let's take a short break.
[02:41:43.310 --> 02:41:44.251]  Think of the fantasies.
[02:41:45.993 --> 02:41:47.715]  We're going to take a quick break.
[02:41:47.775 --> 02:41:49.637]  If you can stick around, we'll talk more on the other side.
[02:41:50.017 --> 02:41:51.358]  You're fascinating to talk to.
[02:41:53.732 --> 02:41:56.773]  They will use her and exploit her for all their political purposes.
[02:41:57.013 --> 02:41:59.053]  They can put her in front of a jury in New York.
[02:41:59.254 --> 02:42:02.214]  They would convict a hand sandwich if you told them it was Republican.
[02:42:02.274 --> 02:42:18.879]  And this really illustrates how, historically, back in eras that were governed by prejudice, you could go to any jurisdiction that was deeply racist, deeply prejudiced, find anybody to level any charges against a specific person or a group of person, and you knew that you would find a jury to convict just based on prejudices.
[02:42:19.019 --> 02:42:24.846]  Racial prejudices of decades ago has now been replaced with political prejudices of today, and it's just as broken a system.
[02:42:24.685 --> 02:42:28.604]   So anybody celebrating this, we know how you would have been ruling on verdicts back in the day.
[02:42:28.604 --> 02:42:37.485]  [Music]
[02:42:37.485 --> 02:42:41.084]  83.3 million dollars to E. Jean Carroll.
[02:42:41.084 --> 02:42:42.085]  65.
[02:42:42.184 --> 02:42:44.106]  $65 million punitive damages.
[02:42:44.146 --> 02:42:46.368]  And from what I understand, Trump is going to appeal.
[02:42:46.708 --> 02:42:52.593]  But from what I understand, he would nonetheless have to put up $83.3 million in court pending his appeal.
[02:42:52.893 --> 02:42:59.039]  Or get a bond and secure a portion of that, pay interest on the loan or whatever in order to post that pending appeal.
[02:42:59.359 --> 02:43:04.158]   This is how the government seizes private property, uses lawfare in order to target,
[02:43:04.158 --> 02:43:09.158]   find an individual, fabricate a crime, and then basically steal the assets of that individual.
[02:43:09.158 --> 02:43:11.798]  You see it happening in New York under Alvin Bragg.
[02:43:11.798 --> 02:43:13.838]  You see it happening in New York under Leticia James.
[02:43:13.838 --> 02:43:16.479]  You see it happening in New York under this judge Kaplan.
[02:43:16.479 --> 02:43:21.038]   In this case, it is plain, it's in your face, and this is how empires fall.
[02:43:21.038 --> 02:43:22.799]  You think this ends at Trump?
[02:43:22.827 --> 02:43:25.048]  Anybody in New York should flee New York.
[02:43:25.088 --> 02:43:26.788]  You think now it's going to be limited to politics?
[02:43:27.129 --> 02:43:33.271]  If you are politically unfavored, if you are just socially disfavored, they will do it to you because they're getting away with it now.
[02:43:33.511 --> 02:43:38.033]  They started with these bogus, guilty-before-the-trial verdicts with Alex Jones.
[02:43:38.073 --> 02:43:41.354]  They did it to Donald Trump in the Judge Enger on Leticia James case.
[02:43:41.394 --> 02:43:42.335]  They did it to him here.
[02:43:42.615 --> 02:43:45.356]  And they just issue awards like confetti.
[02:43:45.716 --> 02:43:53.188]   Outrageous, insane monetary awards for damages that nobody has sustained. Seven and a half million dollars reputational
[02:43:53.188 --> 02:43:59.438]   damages? I'm sorry, no way! 65 million dollars in punitive damages, just something that you know
[02:43:59.438 --> 02:44:03.977]   will survive a bankruptcy so that you know they'll have to pay it. If this does not get overturned
[02:44:03.977 --> 02:44:08.557]   in appeal, at some point the judicial system is gone. Pack up your bikes, get out of New York and
[02:44:08.557 --> 02:44:20.225]   find a state that is not totally corrupt And just one thing that I found particularly interesting, because as I was looking into this, I found an article which by the headline referred to E. Jean Carroll as Jewish American columnist.
[02:44:20.566 --> 02:44:23.086]  E. Jean Carroll sues Donald Trump for alleged rape.
[02:44:23.086 --> 02:44:26.606]   And I was like, oh, well, that's a very bizarre headline for this article.
[02:44:26.606 --> 02:44:29.966]  And I click on it and the article itself only refers to E.
[02:44:29.966 --> 02:44:31.245]  Jean Carroll as a columnist.
[02:44:31.245 --> 02:44:34.365]  The article was from the Jerusalem Post from 2019.
[02:44:34.365 --> 02:44:40.686]   And I noticed that it happened to have been updated in January, 2024, five years
[02:44:40.686 --> 02:44:41.966]  after the article was first published.
[02:44:42.006 --> 02:44:43.127]  Four and a half, five years later?
[02:44:43.467 --> 02:44:46.290]  And I had to go back to the Wayback Machine and just make sure that I'm not going crazy.
[02:44:46.550 --> 02:45:01.344]  And for some reason, and I can think of two possibilities, the Jerusalem Post, which once upon a time took pride in identifying E. Jean Carroll as a Jewish-American journalist, maybe now is not quite so proud of this batshit crazy lady who secured a ridiculous decision out of New York.
[02:45:01.604 --> 02:45:03.486]  There might be other reasons even more nefarious.
[02:45:03.786 --> 02:45:04.467]  I won't go there.
[02:45:04.807 --> 02:45:05.848]  I just thought it was very curious.
[02:45:05.868 --> 02:45:08.270]  But the bottom line, this is a joke, but it's not funny.
[02:45:08.450 --> 02:45:12.833]  It's a bloody tragedy, and it's showing how the court system can be used as political tools.
[02:45:13.013 --> 02:45:15.335]  This is nothing shy of election interference.
[02:45:15.655 --> 02:45:16.236]  Full stop.
[02:45:16.556 --> 02:45:23.681]  E. Jean Carroll exploits a newly amended law which extended the statute of limitations for civil claims for such alleged conduct.
[02:45:24.222 --> 02:45:27.865]  She had a pivotal role in lobbying for that legislative change.
[02:45:28.084 --> 02:45:33.784]   She then exploits that being funded by highly political financiers to take this case to
[02:45:33.784 --> 02:45:39.664]   a politically partisan, hack, corrupt state like New York so that she can get a verdict,
[02:45:39.664 --> 02:45:43.843]   so that they can run the headlines that Trump is a rapist, so that they can then get ridiculous
[02:45:43.843 --> 02:45:49.603]   damages on alleged defamation for a man nearly protesting his innocence, saying she's crazy,
[02:45:49.603 --> 02:45:51.184]  I never even met her.
[02:45:51.184 --> 02:45:54.904]   This is communist level crap and if you don't understand it, you are part of the problem
[02:45:55.852 --> 02:45:56.493]  That is the latest.
[02:45:56.693 --> 02:45:57.313]  It's bullcrap.
[02:45:57.473 --> 02:45:58.254]  It's gonna go to appeal.
[02:45:58.294 --> 02:46:05.700]  If it doesn't get turned over in appeal, get out of New York, find a state where you might be better protected, and make sure to protect yourself nonetheless, because they're gonna come for everybody.
[02:46:05.740 --> 02:46:10.863]  This is going to be the go-to tool to bankrupt people, to destroy people, and more importantly, to silence people.
[02:46:11.024 --> 02:46:12.325]  Alright people, now I gotta go eat dinner.
[02:46:12.485 --> 02:46:13.125]  Now you know your vlog.
[02:46:13.345 --> 02:46:13.646]  Peace out.
