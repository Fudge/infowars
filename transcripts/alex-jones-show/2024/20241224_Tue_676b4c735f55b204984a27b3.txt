[00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.689]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:41.530]  Rising from the ashes of censorship, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.289]  All of us together are going to lift the curse off of this country, and we're going to send the globalists to prison!
[00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:51.509]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.329]  First they come for Alex Jones, and then they're going to come for us.
[00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:58.710]  And they try to bankrupt Alex Jones or try to put Alex Jones in prison.
[00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:05.670]  The demonization of Alex Jones should be of profound interest to everybody all across the board, even progressives.
[00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.390]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:10.530]  Alex Jones taught me about this s*** 20 years ago.
[00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.189]  Listen!
[00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:17.109]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one!
[00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.359]  The Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:46.799]  Coming to you live from the undisputed heart of the global resistance to the new world order, Austin, Texas, where myself and Elon Musk and Joe Rogan are all residing.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:58.959]  And I've been here for 30 plus years, raising the alarm about the New World Order and the hell they were going to release.
[00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.319]  And a lot of people listened before they'd fully rolled it out while it was in beta.
[00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:10.460]  But now, people are really listening because we're not in the testing phase anymore.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.360]  The globalist dehumanizing operation is now operational.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.000]  And is now in high gear.
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:39.419]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, December 24th, 2024. I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are 26 days from President Trump being inaugurated.
[00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.219]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live show.
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.340]  Teleprompter-free, Christmas Eve special transmission.
[00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:50.919]  All right.
[00:02:51.879 --> 00:03:05.960]  We've got a lot of really good news, not just here but around the world, as the explosive awakening just continues to build and become stronger by the day.
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.240]  And you have Senator Paul saying, look, I'm not just referring, as he's done twice, for criminal investigation of Fauci.
[00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:21.840]  He says it's cut and dry, gain of function is illegal, lying to Congress is illegal, serious felonies, arrest him now.
[00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:41.840]  And if one top globalist operative gets arrested for the human trafficking or the COVID creation, Or any of it, the money laundering in Ukraine, the whole house of cards that's already collapsing will accelerate to the ground.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.819]  So we've got that coming up.
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.620]  Then as I said yesterday, the White House is in high gear.
[00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.580]  The outgoing lame duck White House.
[00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:05.169]  Trying to hand Trump a total disaster, bare minimum, perhaps hand him World War III, or nuclear World War III. We're already in World War III. The question is, will it become nuclear?
[00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:17.649]  And yesterday, the Secretary of State and The National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, were saying, oh, Iran might sneak attack us with nukes.
[00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.769]  Now they're claiming Pakistan will.
[00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.230]  This is a big concern.
[00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.290]  We'll cover it first when we come back on this live Christmas Eve transmission.
[00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:28.250]  However you're listening or watching, share those links now.
[00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.889]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:48.939]  It is Christmas Eve on this Tuesday live transmission, December 24th, 2021. 24. And I come to you from the embattled, information war-hardened studios in Austin,
[00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:58.620]  Texas, transmitting worldwide in defiance of tyranny and in total defense of liberty.
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.439]  All right.
[00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.290]  We have elections and preparation for elections all over the globe.
[00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:15.370]  And anti-globalist pro-liberty groups are winning and surging everywhere.
[00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:31.889]  The establishment corporate media run by the big think tanks and intelligence agencies are in total conniption fits and are generating and creating and exacerbating crises and attempt to To bring humanity to our knees,
[00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:40.709]  but the vast majority of people are awake and not going along with it, and many of the minions are starting to wake up very, very quickly.
[00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:49.209]  But that great news is extremely paradoxical because the bad guys are not going to give up.
[00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:56.069]  So, they're launching all of their virus hysteria and fear-mongering.
[00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.050]  They are...
[00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:08.350]  Using anthropologists and sociologists to create as much cultural division, depending on the divisions in the area that they're dividing and conquering or attempting to.
[00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:15.509]  They are trying to escalate and exacerbate military conflicts.
[00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:25.829]  They are waging war through their private central banks against any independent local business or farming infrastructure.
[00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:29.350]  But every day that passes...
[00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.610]  Exponentially, they are losing ground.
[00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:45.569]  The tide has violently, and I mean that as if waves crashing into the shore turned against them.
[00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.110]  They are being thrown against the rocks.
[00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:57.730]  They are having their political bones and backs and skulls shattered and smashed into bloody pulp.
[00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:01.079]  In the information war.
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:08.439]  Because we have the white, hot, flaming sword of victorious truth.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:14.139]  And all they have is their fountains of vomitous lies.
[00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:36.259]  But once you're aware of their endgame, their master plan, how duplicitous, how deceptive, how disgusting they are, how their deceptive formulas and operations work, Then their schemes have no power over you other than the power to enrage you culturally,
[00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:51.319]  spiritually, financially, politically, geopolitically, to remove your support from everything the enemies control.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:59.009]  And without your support, They will be completely destroyed.
[00:08:01.269 --> 00:08:11.389]  And that's why they've been racing to get their global cashless society on and to cut off the resources so that you're so desperate you will accept a global social credit score and universal basic income.
[00:08:11.769 --> 00:08:23.569]  With the AI carbon tax regimen tracking, controlling and manipulating and penalizing and rewarding when you're a good slave everything you do.
[00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.889]  But by increments, always taking more, more, more.
[00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:34.730]  And the people that go along with it will think they're smart because they're doing better than others who aren't submitting.
[00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:40.789]  But in the end, we all end up being complete slaves with no free will.
[00:08:41.009 --> 00:08:42.470]  That is the endgame of the enemy.
[00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:54.009]  All right, Senator Paul is not just doing referrals, as he's done twice before, calling for criminal investigations and saying it's clear that Fauci's committed crimes.
[00:08:54.169 --> 00:09:06.129]  He's saying, damn it, I want him arrested now, cut and dry, illegal, get a function, all the documents, all the admissions, all the witnesses, his own documents, his own prospectus, his own funding.
[00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:20.009]  Requests that were received, his own events he's put on publicly, like in defense of gain-of-function, his lying to Congress about weaponizing viruses, making him stronger, making him spread faster.
[00:09:21.049 --> 00:09:23.289]  He was behind HIV, behind it all.
[00:09:23.409 --> 00:09:26.830]  I mean, that is a real, psychotic, evil gremlin.
[00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:30.870]  That is a true Rumpelstiltskin.
[00:09:31.929 --> 00:09:34.789]  That is a true evil elf.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:44.860]  Not the type that brings presents down the chimney, but brings you bioweapons and deadly shots that turn off your immune system and are filled with cancer viruses.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.580]  That is a man that would make Joseph Mengele, the Nazi angel of death, blush.
[00:09:51.639 --> 00:10:00.440]  If you graded evil by its height, Fauci is a trillion feet tall in his evil.
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.840]  Joseph Mengele was only a thousand feet tall.
[00:10:06.049 --> 00:10:09.549]  He is one of the greatest mass murderers in all of history.
[00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:27.129]  And of course he is an adjunct and a field marshal for Bill Gates, who's been the chairman since his father stepped down in 1999 of the Global Depopulation Eugenics Society,
[00:10:27.129 --> 00:10:30.750]  which is the true name of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.850]  Look it up.
[00:10:34.129 --> 00:10:47.990]  And they think you're so stupid, they see you as a useless eater, they see you as a cockroach that has gotten into the pumpkin pie on the table, and they want to smash you flatter than a greasy stain on the cement.
[00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:49.990]  We have that.
[00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:58.769]  We have new developments since I came on air and said, wow, look at the Secretary of State, look at the National Security Advisor, Blinken and Trump.
[00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:05.730]  Others, like Sullivan, saying, oh, we think Iran might nuke the U.S. or Europe or Israel any minute.
[00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:10.070]  And they've been briefing Trump, warning him that this could be imminent.
[00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.350]  And now they've come out and added Pakistan to it.
[00:11:15.029 --> 00:11:17.889]  Why, Pakistan might launch a nuclear sneak attack.
[00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:23.169]  Now, what would happen if they claimed that that took place?
[00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.809]  Well, both countries know that would be physical suicide.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.039]  They would be thermal nuked into ashes.
[00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:39.799]  And neither country has been threatening that.
[00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:45.659]  So why would we be hearing that they're going to sneak attack?
[00:11:47.799 --> 00:11:48.919]  Well, that's very obvious.
[00:11:49.159 --> 00:11:51.820]  It's not like I just started saying this today, now that they're doing this.
[00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:54.700]  I said, if they start hyping, I didn't think of Pakistan, though.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:04.799]  If they start hyping, then Iran's going to sneak attack us with a nuke, or Iran's trying to sneak a nuke in, which I said a couple years ago and a few months ago and last week.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:12.000]  I said, particularly once President Trump is president-elect, very close to him getting in, this could be their ultimate move.
[00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:16.669]  And I said, if they start hyping it, We got big problems.
[00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:18.370]  And voila!
[00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:21.830]  Here we are.
[00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:37.730]  And I said as soon as Trump is president-elect, I expect the U.S. will authorize NATO, that the U.S. controls, the globalists to control America's control, that they will start raining down high-tech, long-range cruise missiles on Russia as a massive escalatory provocation.
[00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:45.250]  And right on time, week and a half after Trump got elected, the bombs started dropping on Russia property.
[00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:49.950]  Not hard to predict because they told you this is one of their plans.
[00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:57.730]  And they're hyping race war and hyping secession under the civil unrest.
[00:12:57.909 --> 00:13:01.289]  They'll trigger through their Soros groups and they'll call it race war.
[00:13:02.409 --> 00:13:03.809]  And they're doing that.
[00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:11.929]  Carville said before the election, if Trump wins, we need armed uprisings by the black people and by the migrants because Trump is coming to kill you!
[00:13:14.129 --> 00:13:17.850]  So, they're obviously going to provide the false flags upon Trump getting in.
[00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:21.230]  They don't kill him in the next 26 days, which I pray doesn't happen.
[00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.289]  You notice Trump's been bunkering down a lot more, which is smart.
[00:13:25.429 --> 00:13:32.929]  I said, my God, if you're going to put yourself out in danger of all the assassination attempts to win, if you think that's necessary, okay, I think it's not necessary.
[00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:39.580]  Once you win, you better bunker down.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.399]  And he's cut back his activity about 95% as a dead reckoning.
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.820]  So that's a big deal.
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.379]  Article on Infowars.com.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.720]  Lame duck Biden stokes fears of Iranian nukes and Pakistan missiles to Trump again.
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.580]  We're going over all of that.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:10.919]  There's more coming out in the news about these different government agency initiatives to censor and manipulate the press and attack the American people ahead of lawfare.
[00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:21.519]  That's the second part is that they sue you in red court houses like Trump and myself have been the, and Giuliani and many others, the victims of.
[00:14:21.679 --> 00:14:23.879]  There's some very interesting information on that.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:33.919]  We've also got a lot of information on new DEI attempts that Biden's trying to get past and funding.
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:40.200]  And they're also shuffling around money they already have for further culture war.
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:52.120]  We also have Rand Paul's Festivus report exposes Fauci's NIH wasting taxpayer money on barbaric cat experiments, electroshock and brain mutilation.
[00:14:53.899 --> 00:14:54.899]  And he asked, why do they do that?
[00:14:54.919 --> 00:14:58.840]  It's about training the medical workers, the technicians to do barbarous things.
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:07.539]  And I learned that from family that was working in those areas and decided to get out of it.
[00:15:07.659 --> 00:15:09.000]  And they later asked, why do we do this?
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.720]  And they said, well, it's a test to see what you'll do.
[00:15:11.799 --> 00:15:12.379]  No kidding.
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.580]  Oh, remove these beagles' larynxes and then...
[00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:25.389]  Tie them down and put a bag over their head with flesh-eating flies that lay maggots in their flesh.
[00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.009]  That's what Fauci funds, one of thousands of things.
[00:15:30.169 --> 00:15:30.450]  Why?
[00:15:32.129 --> 00:15:34.269]  Because they want to see if people will do that.
[00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.610]  It's like the Mexican Mafia or the Italian Mafia or any other Mafia.
[00:15:40.569 --> 00:15:41.950]  Okay, well, you want to be a real member?
[00:15:42.409 --> 00:15:50.070]  You got to work for us a few years, robbing places, carrying packages, being a pimp, whatever, but now we want this business owner killed.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.799]  Because he won't pay his protection money.
[00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:56.220]  And some of these gangs want it really barbarous.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.639]  You know, while you're at it, go ahead and kill his family.
[00:15:59.419 --> 00:16:05.059]  The Italians don't really, or didn't used to do that, or other classical Irish mafia, you name it.
[00:16:05.179 --> 00:16:09.580]  But the Latin American gangs, others, it's a thing.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.279]  See if you'll do that, because then they got all the dirt on you, everything else.
[00:16:13.259 --> 00:16:14.820]  They want to see who you really are.
[00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:16.940]  So we want you to kill this guy.
[00:16:17.039 --> 00:16:25.440]  And by the way, we want you to put a car bomb on his SUV. We want you to wait till he's going to church with his family.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.759]  He goes to church about 9 a.m.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:27.240]  every Sunday.
[00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:31.700]  We want you to blow his SUV up with his wife and kids in on the turnpike.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:40.360]  And by then in a criminal organization, if you don't say yes, they kill you.
[00:16:43.789 --> 00:16:45.809]  So, they vet people.
[00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.590]  And that's how this is done.
[00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.870]  And I was told that when I was seven years old by my dad.
[00:16:56.809 --> 00:16:59.090]  Because again, he won a Texas show.
[00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:17.549]  He had competitions and stuff in science, and his mom was a principal and school teacher and stuff, and she got him involved in all the different things, and they said, oh, there's a thing, you know, Eisenhower's program, he was already out, but it was the program he started, the WizKid thing, and told the story before, but it's important, and you can look up the WizKid thing,
[00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:23.029]  it continued by Kennedy, and that's what my dad was involved in by then.
[00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:28.230]  And they said, well, you're joining this thing.
[00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:30.950]  It's about the National Institutes of Science and all of it.
[00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:39.250]  And your first job when you're 15 is we're going to send you down to Houston at MD Anderson Cancer Research Facility.
[00:17:40.809 --> 00:17:42.210]  And I'm sitting there seven, eight years old.
[00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:43.369]  My dad's explaining this to me.
[00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:47.130]  And he went back to me after about a year of that and said, I'd like to be transferred.
[00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:52.950]  I don't like this part of NASA. Of course, it wasn't NASA. And I was Department of Defense doing that.
[00:17:54.009 --> 00:18:02.269]  And so, and then he wouldn't tell me the other things, other little things he did.
[00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:05.250]  But by the time he was 18, he said, you know what?
[00:18:05.369 --> 00:18:07.049]  I think I'm not going to do this anymore.
[00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:16.470]  So, can you imagine at 15 what he was doing at that cancer research facility?
[00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:28.690]  Can you imagine the type of stuff the higher ups before they graduate to being right under Fauci have done?
[00:18:32.089 --> 00:18:35.130]  And Fauci came up right around the same time as my dad.
[00:18:36.269 --> 00:18:38.170]  So this is a cult.
[00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:45.529]  So it's not just MS-13 that to become an inner member you have to conduct satanic ceremonies and sacrifice children.
[00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:48.099]  That's mainline media, by the way.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.500]  I reported that decades ago, but now that's mainline news admitting that.
[00:18:51.579 --> 00:18:52.440]  That's the FBI reports.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.500]  You have to grab a little girl, eight-year-old.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.059]  There's a lot of cases from one in what was in New York.
[00:18:59.299 --> 00:19:00.579]  It was Long Island a few years ago.
[00:19:00.759 --> 00:19:07.240]  And you got to take them and rape them and then carve pentagrams on them and do a satanic ritual and then cut their heart out.
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.220]  Just see if you'll do it.
[00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:11.519]  See...
[00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:48.490]  So when you're Fauci level and you're going to create HIV and put it in the tetanus shots and put it in the main was the hepatitis shot in the late 70s and then give people drugs that actually kill them when it's not even the HIV doing it and then you see him 45 years later what he's doing to us now 30 plus million dead from the shots immune systems turned off mass cancer rates exploding I mean this is a serious group of people they're not playing games So,
[00:19:48.490 --> 00:20:04.130]  if 15-year-olds were getting recruited by the Department of Defense, and my dad,
[00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:08.549]  by the way, didn't even figure this out until he was 18, that they don't tell you.
[00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:24.059]  You're like, oh yeah, it's NASA, it's NASA. And then he was drafted into Vietnam and was getting on the bus to go to Fort Hood and a car pulls in, told this story, and they said,
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.240]  paperwork, no, he belongs to us.
[00:20:30.839 --> 00:20:38.119]  That's one hand, I don't know what the other hand did, but that's an example of how insidious this thing is.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.720]  Because my dad was like, sure, you know.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.440]  People came by.
[00:20:45.019 --> 00:20:46.500]  He was about to get drafted, actually.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.819]  He went and filled out the paperwork, said, I love to camp.
[00:20:48.819 --> 00:20:49.539]  I love the outdoors.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.920]  They said, oh, you're infantry.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.160]  You're going to Fort Hood, baby.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.900]  And he'd already been doing this for years, working for the government and these projects they'd sent him to.
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.579]  He was at UT when he was 14, 15 at MD Anderson.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.099]  All plan two.
[00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:05.890]  It's when they put kids in college.
[00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:09.769]  And he didn't start figuring it out until he was like 18. Well, wait a minute.
[00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:13.069]  The Department of Defense, I want to go to the war.
[00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:13.529]  Oh, no.
[00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.809]  You're already in the war, son.
[00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:15.990]  You belong to us.
[00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:17.769]  So I'm not going to tell you more of the story.
[00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:24.109]  The point is that this has been going on forever.
[00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:43.730]  And Eisenhower, when he left office in early 61, gave his farewell address and warned of the scientific technological elite controlling 90% of the funding and policies and not even following his own directives.
[00:21:44.809 --> 00:21:47.890]  And how they were in control of the military industrial complex.
[00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:51.990]  But everybody always hears about him saying, beware the military industrial complex.
[00:21:52.250 --> 00:22:03.210]  But in the full 21 minute speech, he defines it as controlled by a technological elite of technocrats who were forming a coup against America and freedom.
[00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.950]  So in the speech, he warns about Russia and communism.
[00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:24.940]  But he goes on to say, you can pull the transcript up, an equal threat Is our own scientific technological elite who are in control of science and technology and the universities and the research and the government agencies and the military.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.359]  So you've got to beware the military-industrial complex.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.180]  It's on YouTube.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.940]  Eisenhower's farewell address is 21 minutes long.
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:36.579]  Memory serves.
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:37.180]  Guys, pull up.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.519]  Eisenhower's full farewell address on YouTube.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.859]  Type in Eisenhower's full farewell address from the White House.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.400]  We probably just played again today.
[00:22:46.339 --> 00:22:47.380]  So, yeah, there it is.
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:47.960]  How long is it?
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:48.940]  My memory says 21 minutes.
[00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:49.460]  How long is it?
[00:22:50.859 --> 00:22:52.980]  16. I must have seen a version that added some more stuff.
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:57.339]  But that's what we're talking about.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.039]  So how do you face a coup that's scientific?
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.799]  Well, you've got to be scientific yourself.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.279]  So notice this scientific coup...
[00:23:09.259 --> 00:23:11.380]  Tells you two men can have a baby, there's no X and Y chromosomes.
[00:23:11.619 --> 00:23:13.279]  They don't want you to know about real science.
[00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:16.259]  They give you a science that's the opposite of science.
[00:23:16.259 --> 00:23:17.680]  It's not about asking questions.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.420]  It's about being illogical.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.000]  And then say, I am the science, like Fauci said.
[00:23:24.019 --> 00:23:27.259]  So when we come back, I'm going to get to all of it.
[00:23:29.799 --> 00:23:31.240]  But let me do this right now.
[00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:42.140]  I was thinking about how I announced this yesterday, and I didn't really do a good job, because this is so exciting and so big that I didn't really make the most important point.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:52.500]  Thealexjonesstore.com has amazing products, the best supplements, the widest selection of Patriot apparel, some of the best designs out there, period.
[00:23:53.859 --> 00:23:58.759]  I'm not going to say all of them are the best, but we've got some of the best, and a lot of other great ones.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.119]  It's amazing.
[00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:03.119]  And we definitely have the biggest selection of Patriot Apparel.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:15.000]  I break it down to the Patriot 1776, classic Americana, the pro-Trump, Trump won victory stuff, the Alex Jones Infowars stuff, and then the comedy Patriot stuff.
[00:24:17.359 --> 00:24:33.369]  And when you go there, and more items are getting out all the time, and it's going to have thousands of items soon, when you go there and you sign up for the affiliate program, you're just given a link, Create your own account.
[00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:34.269]  It takes like two minutes.
[00:24:35.089 --> 00:24:48.769]  And you're sent your own link that when you're on Instagram or particularly X or Facebook or YouTube or you're on your own personal email, anywhere, you just add the link to the affiliate program and tell folks, hey, I love the products or there's some great t-shirts.
[00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.450]  You can put a link to it with a picture up.
[00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:51.430]  It generates it for you.
[00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:54.309]  And then you get 10% of the gross sale right off the top.
[00:24:54.609 --> 00:24:55.789]  Not 10% of the profit.
[00:24:56.369 --> 00:24:58.650]  A lot of affiliate programs say 10%, but they go of the profit.
[00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:58.869]  No, no.
[00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.069]  Off the top.
[00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.430]  That is gargantuan.
[00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:20.029]  And all the different people that have huge accounts on X and everywhere else, you just post your video, your article, your link, and say, oh, by the way, help keep Alex Jones on the air as citizen journalism and fund what we're all doing in the fight against tyranny.
[00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:24.589]  And I'm telling you, this is going to be so successful.
[00:25:24.589 --> 00:25:33.960]  And I already saw a lot of other great channels on X yesterday saying, Last night, within just a few hours of me launching this, they're already putting out the affiliate links and they're already getting sales.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.079]  So this is amazing.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:44.200]  Things like this could really not just end our funding issues, if we're fighting the deep state, we'd have any problems if we were just not having to fight them.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.440]  Allow us to expand and get more reporters and go 24 hours a day.
[00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:49.619]  We'll do it all.
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.279]  If you just keep supporting at thealexjonesstore.com, we'll get great supplements and more.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.779]  But everybody should become an affiliate member.
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.500]  It's free right now.
[00:25:57.619 --> 00:26:00.660]  And there's so many new great campaign coins.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:06.500]  There's already the classic Save the Frogs coffee mug is back.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.299]  It's all at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:16.450]  The globalist, black rock, New World Order criminals want to make you poor and they want to make you sick.
[00:26:16.609 --> 00:26:17.950]  It's in their own admissions.
[00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:25.690]  Well, in any real revolution against tyranny, it is critical that we be independent and that we have the power of free speech.
[00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:31.529]  I'm bringing you the ultimate win-win or 360 win or non-zero-sum game.
[00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.410]  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing...
[00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:37.630]  The AlexJonesStore.com affiliate program.
[00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.990]  It's so easy, even I know how to do it.
[00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:41.069]  And I'm not a big tech person.
[00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:42.210]  It's free.
[00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:43.809]  You go to TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[00:26:44.089 --> 00:26:45.450]  You go sign up for free.
[00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:48.150]  You're given your own affiliate link.
[00:26:49.009 --> 00:26:51.410]  And then each month you can cash it out.
[00:26:52.029 --> 00:27:02.170]  10% of every sale of game-changing supplements and amazing Patriot apparel and other great products that people love will go to you each month.
[00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:10.089]  So this is a way to help folks out getting great products to keep the show on the air and expanding in the face of the new world order and to put money in your pocket.
[00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:11.609]  The globalists want you poor.
[00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.549]  They want you unhealthy.
[00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:14.009]  They want us isolated.
[00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:17.289]  They don't want all this Patriot apparel out there as we realize how strong we are.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.079]  And so we don't meet like-minded people.
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.759]  This thing is so exciting.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.119]  I was sitting here before I sort of taping this announcement.
[00:27:24.119 --> 00:27:26.319]  I was thinking, how do I hype this enough?
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.980]  If people get excited about this, if folks take action with this information, it's incredible.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:38.480]  And the folks who are doing it with, our great sponsor, TheAlexinStore.com, have done this with other talk shows, and it's been extremely successful.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.660]  And this is a chance for you to join the Infowar.
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.019]  So many people say, hey, we want to help you.
[00:27:44.059 --> 00:27:44.759]  We want to get involved.
[00:27:44.839 --> 00:27:45.299]  What can we do?
[00:27:45.759 --> 00:27:46.720]  This is how you do it.
[00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:47.339]  It's decentralized.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.980]  It's all up to you and how much action you take sharing the links.
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.500]  We've got the great products and the great customer service and everything else.

[00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.609]  Now go to thealexjonesstore.com and sign up right now.
[00:28:08.579 --> 00:28:14.960]  Coming up at the bottom of the next hour, Naomi Zeip, a great citizen journalist out of Germany that Elon Musk reposts every couple days.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.559]  She gets hundreds of millions of views a week.
[00:28:16.839 --> 00:28:18.039]  She's very eloquent.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.420]  I've been watching her for about a year, and she's going to be in studio with us next week.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.720]  She's going to be joining us remotely.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.140]  She's in Kentucky right now, traveling the United States.
[00:28:27.799 --> 00:28:30.960]  And boy, the national government of Germany has been demonizing her.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.460]  She's a German citizen.
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:47.529]  How dare her criticize the tyranny of Where just recently they gave a woman a longer prison sentence than the rapist that raped her brutally because she criticized him and said that he was a migrant and he was bad and they shouldn't have opened borders.
[00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:50.430]  They arrest you for your speech over there.
[00:28:50.910 --> 00:29:07.460]  And now we have the U.S. military involved in an article I've got harassing a woman that was a school board member in New Jersey for speaking out very mildly And saying that they were secretly targeting kids with the LGBT grooming.
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.839]  And it was confirmed.
[00:29:09.019 --> 00:29:11.980]  So the Pentagon got involved harassing her.
[00:29:12.059 --> 00:29:21.000]  He thought it was bad the FBI in Virginia and places a few years ago trying to intimidate families going to school boards against DEI and transgenders raping girls.
[00:29:21.109 --> 00:29:23.470]  Girls in the middle school bathrooms.
[00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.309]  It's pure intimidation.
[00:29:26.509 --> 00:29:33.609]  And so everything you see in Germany, that's one of the most tyrannical countries in the world, free speech-wise, they want to do that here.
[00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:50.470]  So what you see in Australia, what you see in Germany, when you see the UK, hundreds of videos, reportedly thousands of arrests, but you've seen the videos, you just type into X or anywhere, a woman arrested for praying silently across the street from abortion clinic.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.539]  Man arrested for praying across the street from Borschenkling.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:05.920]  Man arrested, veteran, war hero arrested, 67, remember that headline, for comparing transgenderism to Nazis.
[00:30:08.119 --> 00:30:11.980]  That's what the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center and Democratic Party want to do here.
[00:30:12.099 --> 00:30:17.940]  They're trying to pass laws that are ultra draconian in Canada right now.
[00:30:19.509 --> 00:30:21.369]  You've already seen what they've done to people up there.
[00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:23.289]  I mean, these people mean business.
[00:30:23.809 --> 00:30:25.710]  These are real totalitarians.
[00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:31.990]  So, she's coming up, bottom of the next hour, in about 57 minutes from now.
[00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:34.369]  Or exactly how long.
[00:30:35.009 --> 00:30:38.890]  So, this is a big deal.
[00:30:41.699 --> 00:30:44.799]  And we're going to be going over it with her.
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.140]  J.D. Vance appears to defend Germany's far-right AFD party.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.619]  They're always like, we can't believe Musk is defending them.
[00:30:51.779 --> 00:30:52.740]  We can't...
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:31:00.480]  It couldn't be real that Musk is tweeting this woman and people like her and she's getting 50 million, 100 million views on her videos.
[00:31:00.619 --> 00:31:01.680]  I mean, what are we going to do?
[00:31:01.839 --> 00:31:02.960]  I mean, she gets...
[00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:06.589]  More viewers in a day than the national German news.
[00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:07.349]  What do we...
[00:31:07.349 --> 00:31:09.970]  Remember the members of Congress who put the videos last week?
[00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:13.029]  I mean, Musk and the public are putting pressure on Congress.
[00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:15.130]  We can't have them put pressure on us.
[00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.269]  They killed our pork barrel bill last week.
[00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:18.809]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:31:18.809 --> 00:31:20.549]  We've got to stop them right now.
[00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:27.329]  The average show has 53,000 viewers.
[00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:28.289]  That's the average.
[00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:29.950]  Total.
[00:31:30.609 --> 00:31:31.450]  Per hour.
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:43.160]  On MSNBC. CNN's got less than 30. Their average show had about 100,000 a few months ago.
[00:31:43.859 --> 00:31:49.119]  Now, 100,000 is dead for a company that spends billions a year.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.200]  And they made, what, 4 billion last year, CNN. Look it up.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.839]  Well, the company's advertising aren't selling anything.
[00:31:55.839 --> 00:31:57.380]  It's their tithe.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:58.839]  To propaganda.
[00:31:59.359 --> 00:32:02.680]  To keep the facade up that anybody believes this.
[00:32:03.079 --> 00:32:07.599]  But now that they couldn't steal the election, there's basically no value even in the facade now.
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:15.279]  And that's why the layoffs and the pay cuts, it's all happening everywhere in corporate media because they're such liars.
[00:32:15.279 --> 00:32:22.180]  And the more they double down and say a car killed people in Germany at a Christmas festival, a woman just burst into flames.
[00:32:23.369 --> 00:32:24.009]  On the subway.
[00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:25.690]  And then now I got new videos.
[00:32:25.809 --> 00:32:27.950]  They still won't say he was an illegal alien deported by Trump.
[00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.170]  Let back in by Biden.
[00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:35.809]  They will not report it because they're the enemy of the people.
[00:32:37.069 --> 00:32:46.589]  And look, it was rough 20 years ago, 10 years ago, even five years ago to take these people on because they had lawfare, they had PR firms, they had the Justice Department.
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:52.380]  But now the tides turn so bad that it's good to be Joe Rogan opposing the globalist.
[00:32:52.579 --> 00:32:53.619]  He has nothing to lose now.
[00:32:54.019 --> 00:32:55.640]  It's good to be Elon doing it.
[00:32:55.799 --> 00:32:58.079]  They're still coming after him, but that's dissipating.
[00:32:59.079 --> 00:33:03.640]  Now, the bad guys still see me as a consolation prize.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.019]  I even said that recently in the news.
[00:33:05.299 --> 00:33:09.279]  Well, we can't get Trump, but boy, we finally shut down InfoWars.
[00:33:09.339 --> 00:33:09.759]  Remember that?
[00:33:10.519 --> 00:33:12.940]  In the last six months, three times, you heard we were closed?
[00:33:13.279 --> 00:33:14.519]  And I said, I've got rights.
[00:33:14.519 --> 00:33:15.079]  That's wrong.
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:15.960]  I'm opposing you.
[00:33:17.119 --> 00:33:17.740]  And they lost.
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:30.779]  So now, and I'm not going to talk about it yet, but if you think the stuff the Justice Department did to Infowars since May 31st was bad, it's even worse now.
[00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:34.920]  I mean, I am dealing with weaponized government.
[00:33:36.419 --> 00:33:41.960]  Because they hate every cell in my body because I'm standing up for you.
[00:33:42.599 --> 00:33:44.460]  I'm in their way, as Trump says.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.420]  And it's important for that to sink in.
[00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:47.880]  I don't say this so you love me.
[00:33:48.019 --> 00:33:49.759]  I don't say this so you go, that's a great guy.
[00:33:49.819 --> 00:33:51.960]  I'm saying it because it's the truth.
[00:33:53.099 --> 00:33:58.519]  I am a soldier on the wall defending you and your family and my family that lives in the same village.
[00:33:59.359 --> 00:34:00.640]  The enemies come in.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.180]  They burn the farms.
[00:34:02.319 --> 00:34:03.460]  We've all run into the castle.
[00:34:05.809 --> 00:34:28.710]  And the auxiliary men that are all the farmers and the bakers and the cobblers that live out in the town and out in the farms, when the vandals or the Visigoths or the Huns or the folks come in to the valley and start attacking and burning,
[00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:35.150]  everybody runs to the castle to defend as long as we can under siege.
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.480]  Well, that analogy is not even the best, though it's accurate.
[00:34:41.559 --> 00:34:48.300]  I'm a sentry of the village, of the little kingdom.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:57.019]  And my job is to stay out at an outpost at the mountain pass into the entrance to our little fortress.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:05.179]  And I'm supposed to light the watchtowers.
[00:35:07.039 --> 00:35:08.559]  Back in the old days, they didn't have radio.
[00:35:09.159 --> 00:35:11.699]  They hadn't even really started using carrier pigeons yet.
[00:35:12.119 --> 00:35:18.219]  So you use the Lord of the Rings analogy that's, you know, fiction, but based on medieval war systems.
[00:35:19.219 --> 00:35:37.110]  And when they see the army of Mordor marching hundreds and hundreds of miles away from Midas Tirith, the capital of Middle Earth, the capital of the good guys, They light the watchtowers and people 30 miles away see another watchtower on fire and they light the watchtower and then they light the watchtower.
[00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:44.650]  And you might sit up there for a decade as a watchman on the watchtower until you see the enemy start coming in and you run and you light the watchtower.
[00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:46.570]  Well, that's what I do.
[00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:56.429]  And as new attacks happen, as the enemy attacks, and as they pull new scams, I'm studying, no exaggeration, seven, eight hours a day.
[00:35:56.869 --> 00:35:57.769]  Not just on air.
[00:35:57.869 --> 00:36:02.530]  I mean, I am studying six, seven, eight hours, some days, ten hours a day.
[00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:05.550]  And I'd like to be doing other stuff.
[00:36:06.389 --> 00:36:12.769]  I'd like to be hiking or playing pool or going to dinner or barbecuing my family or doing arts and crafts with my seven-year-old daughter.
[00:36:13.289 --> 00:36:15.449]  And I still find time to do that, a couple hours a day.
[00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:16.989]  And I focus completely on her.
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:24.500]  But dammit, she has no future if I don't fight them with everything I've got.
[00:36:25.219 --> 00:36:34.980]  And it's not just our information, it's the spirit of this broadcast of overcoming and being dauntless and never backing down.
[00:36:35.179 --> 00:36:44.199]  And despite all the attacks surviving, that Absolutely enrages the globalists.
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.099]  So, as rough as this has been, I'm exactly where I want to be.
[00:36:47.139 --> 00:36:51.119]  I want to thank the viewers and listeners for keeping me on the air in my important mission.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:59.920]  And we are seeing such massive success, all of us together right now.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:07.300]  But the enemy's launching counter-offensives in the info war, in the financial system, in the military, physically.
[00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.369]  Against the borders, trying to kill our champion, Trump.
[00:37:12.989 --> 00:37:22.829]  And they've been shooting and killing a bunch of leaders in Europe that are against open borders in World War III. I mean, they've shot, what, four of them the last year?
[00:37:24.289 --> 00:37:25.750]  Miraculously, all but one survived.
[00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:33.989]  They've stabbed and firebombed a bunch of other people in Spain, in the Netherlands, in Germany.
[00:37:37.869 --> 00:37:50.050]  In the UK, in Eastern Europe, Slovakia, they've had a coup in Romania three weeks ago, NATO, because they voted against war and voted in a patriot.
[00:37:50.349 --> 00:37:50.949]  Oh, we'll just have a coup.
[00:37:51.429 --> 00:37:54.510]  I mean, you know, this is man's work.
[00:37:56.650 --> 00:38:01.289]  So, that's why I'm saying, have you shared the link to Real Alex Jones today?
[00:38:01.329 --> 00:38:02.329]  Have you told people to follow it?
[00:38:02.369 --> 00:38:03.710]  Have you shared the articles and videos?
[00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:06.269]  Because the enemy's working around the clock to stop that.
[00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:11.449]  They filed the Democrat Party law firms in federal court three weeks ago.
[00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:15.190]  They've spent $326 million in the last seven years suing me.
[00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:20.710]  Now, let that sink in.
[00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:27.429]  So, and now they are failing on every front.
[00:38:31.219 --> 00:38:38.639]  If we're going to show a bunch of Lord of the Rings, just type into YouTube, lighting the watchtowers, Lord of the Rings.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.480]  That's what I want.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.239]  There they are trying to light them.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:48.519]  And then they, 20 miles, 30 miles away, see the watchtower, now they know to light the next one, the next one, the next one.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.559]  I mean, that's what they don't want.
[00:38:51.739 --> 00:38:56.420]  And They don't want the urgency that we have here.
[00:38:56.539 --> 00:38:57.960]  Because you should be urgent.
[00:38:58.179 --> 00:39:00.679]  This is normal with this type of tyranny going on.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:07.380]  Public and private schools all over the Western world for at least 10 years, and it's accelerated to it's everywhere now.
[00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:18.159]  Most schools, private or public, the more elite the worst, are literally secretly indoctrinating your children into a eugenic sterilization death cult.
[00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:21.679]  It's beyond just your child getting molested or raped.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:24.420]  They actually want to cut the body parts off.
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.579]  And they want to just normalize this stuff.
[00:39:30.039 --> 00:39:34.199]  And so we're raising the alarm, but now let me get to the good news.
[00:39:36.019 --> 00:39:41.880]  For those that don't know, I'm sure most of you do, Rand Paul's had the hearings, like seven or eight of them, in the last four years.
[00:39:43.579 --> 00:39:45.159]  Fauci's been caught in his own emails.
[00:39:45.719 --> 00:39:47.159]  He's been caught in his own events.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.760]  Hell, on TV, we played the clips.
[00:39:49.750 --> 00:40:05.610]  About gain of function, defensive gain of function, saying we're doing gain of function, souping up viruses, creating new chimeric viruses with a mixture of different viruses, gene edited, gene guns, mixing them together randomly to see what happens, putting them into animals to see how much they spread.
[00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:11.949]  And then deploying the COVID shot that's full of a bunch of live...
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:29.559]  Transmissible cancer viruses and the synthetic HIV spike protein that goes in and hits the exact spot on the DNA strand that is for cancer repair, DNA repair.
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:45.210]  So it hits you and attempts to order your body, it's more successful than some, to turn off your DNA repair replication system And then a bunch of cancer viruses.
[00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.409]  And that's in the mainline medical literature.
[00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:48.489]  They admit that.
[00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:51.949]  So, this is a diabolical attack.
[00:40:52.829 --> 00:41:01.110]  And the globalists cannot get away with this if people are on air with the doctors and the scientists and the studies and the reports exposing them.
[00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:05.570]  And so we've pushed and pushed and pushed exposing this agenda for decades.
[00:41:05.969 --> 00:41:09.530]  The globalists got desperate and launched their attack, their operation lockstep.
[00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:14.349]  That's COVID. War-gamed it to VIT-201 months before they did it.
[00:41:14.849 --> 00:41:17.170]  And it worked for a while, but backfired.
[00:41:17.889 --> 00:41:27.809]  And in all their war games, the globalists in the UN have said, this is in my film, Endgame, we show you the documents, that they're going to use disease X, probably a new virus like the bird flu out of China.
[00:41:29.389 --> 00:41:30.809]  They've since said that all over.
[00:41:30.889 --> 00:41:32.070]  You've seen them everywhere say that.
[00:41:32.989 --> 00:41:34.550]  Fauci, all of them.
[00:41:36.949 --> 00:41:39.250]  And that this will bring in the world government.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:58.860]  So, their main attack that they believe would give them total power, and a world cashless society controller by the name of stopping virus spread, the contact tracing, all of it, is your slave identification tracking system for the social credit score.
[00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:02.219]  Turning the whole earth into an open-air prison.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:11.360]  Hinges on these disease X's, and I told you they'll launch new pandemics, and they'll declare new emergencies in blue cities and states, and they're doing it!
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.239]  It's totally predictable.
[00:42:17.699 --> 00:42:19.099]  You've just got to admit the horror.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.400]  You've got to admit they're bad.
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:24.539]  And Fauci is one of the most hated people on earth.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:26.860]  He's in hiding.
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.019]  So is Bill Gates.
[00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:32.389]  And did they give up?
[00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:34.309]  No, they doubled down, which makes it worse for them.
[00:42:35.329 --> 00:42:36.909]  And we're on air exposing them.
[00:42:38.449 --> 00:42:48.750]  And boy, they thought when nobody else had a big audience doing this, 7, 8, 9, 10 years ago, that trying to shut me down would somehow keep it from getting out.
[00:42:48.909 --> 00:42:51.170]  But sometimes you stomp on a fire.
[00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.030]  If you've got a campfire, it spreads.
[00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:56.150]  You start stomping on it.
[00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:57.989]  And sometimes it actually makes it spread faster.
[00:42:57.989 --> 00:42:58.690]  That's what happened.
[00:43:00.219 --> 00:43:08.000]  And so I can sit back despite all the pain I've had to go through.
[00:43:08.539 --> 00:43:09.699]  And it's been frustrating.
[00:43:09.699 --> 00:43:10.840]  It's not been a cakewalk.
[00:43:11.699 --> 00:43:13.780]  Mainly it's anger and controlling that.
[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:15.840]  Realizing it's all in God's plan.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:30.449]  That Now, what this broadcast stands for, our worldview of how things work, that's dead on accurate, the most accurate you're going to get anywhere, is now the operating system of the global resistance.
[00:43:30.989 --> 00:43:32.610]  You did that as listeners and viewers.
[00:43:32.769 --> 00:43:48.170]  And I got so much news to hit, but I cannot state to you enough what your word of mouth, what your support, what your own research, and our guests and our crew, what we've done as a family, what we've done as an organization of freedom worldwide,
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:57.159]  Has turned the tide and is now the talking points and the worldview of the resistance.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:05.860]  And so I could go away right now and the globalists are still going to lose, though it's going to be a little more rocky.
[00:44:06.039 --> 00:44:09.099]  And I've always told you for decades, my job is to become obsolete.
[00:44:09.099 --> 00:44:10.019]  I'm not there yet.
[00:44:12.599 --> 00:44:16.699]  And there'll still be times that I see stuff before other people, but we're getting to the point where...
[00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:23.349]  95% of the time I was the only person that saw stuff coming that had a major platform.
[00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:33.070]  Then it was 90, 80, 70, 60. It was about 50% of the time we were the progenitors of key understanding just a few months ago.
[00:44:33.329 --> 00:44:37.150]  Now we're the progenitors 40% of the time.
[00:44:37.389 --> 00:44:39.869]  And this is very good news.
[00:44:42.849 --> 00:44:43.269]  So...
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:49.679]  This is exciting.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:50.780]  So thank you.
[00:44:51.119 --> 00:44:54.760]  All right, I want to get to the Fauci information, then we'll get to everything else coming up.
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.760]  But here is Senator Rand Paul, and I just want to make this point.
[00:45:02.619 --> 00:45:05.739]  You get one of these kingpins to fall.
[00:45:09.219 --> 00:45:09.659]  Indicted.
[00:45:10.119 --> 00:45:11.820]  They're already turning on each other.
[00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:15.530]  You think they're flipping to our side right now?
[00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:26.250]  This thing is like an ancient, rotting barn full of termites that's already fallen down partway, and then a high wind comes in, and you see the barn shaking, and you know it's about to fall over.
[00:45:26.409 --> 00:45:28.949]  I mean, it's going down.
[00:45:30.429 --> 00:45:39.630]  And our defeat can only happen if we hesitate and if we don't indict Mayorkas and Fauci and others.
[00:45:42.199 --> 00:45:43.960]  They will launch more attacks.
[00:45:44.119 --> 00:45:46.599]  They will continue to do evil stuff unless we stop them.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.360]  This is about self-preservation.
[00:45:48.719 --> 00:45:49.880]  It's open and shut.
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:56.039]  And there has been this age of the bureaucracy getting away with murder, any crime they wanted for decades.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:04.980]  And that's coming to an end because everybody that's got a brain cell understands now it is existentially dangerous to everyone to let these people continue to operate.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:11.659]  Yeah, it's dangerous to take them on, but it's a lot more dangerous to let these Frankensteins keep running around the countryside.
[00:46:13.079 --> 00:46:22.980]  So, if you think I like getting up here and spotlighting their ass for 30 plus years, and you think I personally have a death wish, and I like having them come after me and my family, no.
[00:46:23.559 --> 00:46:27.880]  But I understood that they're so evil, we had no future if I didn't take them on.
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.119]  And I had talks to my family decades ago, and they said, we don't care.
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.079]  Because they've been getting messed with for at least 20 years.
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:41.840]  And so, everybody needs to get to that point of you have nothing to lose.
[00:46:44.219 --> 00:46:52.599]  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself, as President Roosevelt said at the beginning of World War II for the U.S. And it really is true.
[00:46:53.019 --> 00:46:55.739]  If you give in to their fear and intimidation, you lose everything.
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:57.360]  You should be afraid of being afraid.
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.519]  You should be afraid of submitting to them.
[00:46:59.679 --> 00:47:01.039]  You should be afraid of cucking.
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:10.219]  So all I have is resistance and defiance to them because I love my family and I love the world they live in and I love you by extension.
[00:47:10.539 --> 00:47:13.000]  And I feel the Holy Spirit and it feels...
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:24.679]  It fills me with satisfaction and completion and relief to fight these people.
[00:47:25.679 --> 00:47:27.099]  And they just keep freaking out.
[00:47:27.179 --> 00:47:28.480]  The more they attack me, the more they evenize.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:29.480]  They go, why does he get stronger?
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.900]  Because I already know you're super evil and you just proved it.
[00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:36.110]  And I know there's no way out of this but to fight you.
[00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:39.550]  So, I mean, it's called battle joy, dumbasses.
[00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:42.230]  I'm doing what a man's supposed to do.
[00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:46.389]  I'm being honorable and strong and researched and focusing and having energy.
[00:47:46.389 --> 00:47:47.230]  And I'm committed.
[00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:48.889]  And I have a serious mind.
[00:47:49.409 --> 00:47:51.889]  And so do my listeners and activist supporters.
[00:47:52.349 --> 00:47:53.869]  And we're gonna get you!
[00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:57.150]  Do you understand that?!
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:02.059]  You do know that, don't you?
[00:48:02.579 --> 00:48:03.860]  I promise you.
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:06.539]  You are going to pay dearly for what you've done.
[00:48:07.239 --> 00:48:10.960]  We will get you off the back of our species and our children.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:16.239]  And your leadership is going to supermax prisons.
[00:48:19.079 --> 00:48:22.059]  You will be lucky to spend the rest of your lives in prison.
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:26.360]  All right, here's Senator Paul.
[00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:34.690]  From the very beginning, Anthony Fauci knew he was involved with funding this lab, and he did everything possible.
[00:48:34.909 --> 00:48:36.130]  It's throughout our government.
[00:48:36.389 --> 00:48:40.489]  Eight different agencies in our government are covering up their support for this lab in Wuhan.
[00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:46.949]  It's ongoing as we speak, even though we've had I have a unanimous Congress declassified information.
[00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:51.329]  I have unclassified information that's being withheld from me to this day.
[00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:59.070]  But we have evidence, yes, that they were dishonest, that Anthony Fauci lied in hearings to me, which is a felony, punishable up to five years.
[00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:14.010]  We now have emails that show him saying that he knew it was gain of function, that the virus looked manipulated, and that he was worried that this came from the Wuhan lab February 1st of 2020. Then he spent the last three years saying nothing to see here.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:20.619]  We also know that there was a safety committee that should have reviewed this, and we know that Anthony Fauci went around the safety committee.
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:29.159]  The safety committee set up in place to make sure this wouldn't happen, never saw the Wuhan funding, because Anthony Fauci allowed the funding to go around the safety committee.
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:34.239]  This is a bombshell revelation, and this will eventually bring down Anthony Fauci.
[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:36.380]  Absolutely.
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:42.719]  I've got a short compilation of Bill Gates that I want to play when we come back, and I'm going to finish up on this.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.300]  Victory is in our hands.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.039]  We have the moral authority.
[00:49:49.039 --> 00:49:49.940]  We have the initiative.
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:50.840]  We've turned the tide.
[00:49:52.019 --> 00:49:55.820]  We are not in a normal situation here.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.920]  And we must crush the bad guys.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:06.760]  They must be legally and lawfully annihilated.
[00:50:08.619 --> 00:50:10.079]  And Trump knows that.
[00:50:11.509 --> 00:50:13.510]  So, pray for his safety, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:14.349 --> 00:50:16.210]  And please pray for him for his safety as well.
[00:50:17.909 --> 00:50:18.989]  Alright, we're going to go to break.
[00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:19.650]  We're going to come back.
[00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:23.210]  Again, I could do so much more if I have the funds.
[00:50:23.309 --> 00:50:25.449]  We have incredible products at the yellowshownstore.com.
[00:50:27.739 --> 00:50:33.820]  The best supplements, the best, widest selection of Patriot apparel, and a lot of other new great items that just came in.
[00:50:34.019 --> 00:50:42.019]  This is a classic, very popular mug that just says, save the frogs, realalexjones.com.
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:47.309]  And It's funding the operation.
[00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:49.829]  It's been a popular cut back when it said Infowars.
[00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:51.449]  This is a new variant on that.
[00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:53.869]  It's available at thealexshownstore.com.
[00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:57.349]  There are new challenge coins, or you can call them campaign coins.
[00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:59.610]  They're from $9 to $25.
[00:51:00.409 --> 00:51:02.389]  This new one, a great gift.
[00:51:02.949 --> 00:51:04.469]  They're metal, they're heavy, they're nice.
[00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:07.809]  President of the United States, Donald John Trump.
[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:09.900]  We'll put it back on screen.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:15.619]  On the back, it says 1776 with the American people, the United States of America, take America back.
[00:51:16.159 --> 00:51:17.619]  Donald Trump, take America back.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:18.960]  Coins, 15 bucks.
[00:51:21.039 --> 00:51:23.500]  There are a whole bunch of designs there and more.
[00:51:23.739 --> 00:51:26.039]  And it takes about a minute to do it.
[00:51:26.239 --> 00:51:27.780]  You get a link.
[00:51:28.159 --> 00:51:30.559]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com in the right-hand corner.
[00:51:30.619 --> 00:51:31.480]  It says become an affiliate.
[00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:32.900]  You just go sign up.
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:33.599]  It's absolutely free.
[00:51:33.699 --> 00:51:38.500]  And then any links you put out in articles or whatever or promotion of the products there, you get 10% off the top.

[00:51:42.699 --> 00:51:44.579]  It's fighting the second American Revolution worldwide.
[00:51:45.119 --> 00:51:46.380]  It's time to take action.
[00:51:46.659 --> 00:51:52.579]  So for a lot of you out there, this is free and you can make supplemental money very easily.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:56.039]  I mean, I would imagine most people can make hundreds of bucks a month with their eyes closed.
[00:51:56.219 --> 00:52:02.429]  And if you really kick ass, We're good to go.
[00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:08.829]  We're good to go.
[00:52:08.909 --> 00:52:12.510]  We're good to go.
[00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:19.469]  There are five limited edition fundraiser posters.
[00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:25.090]  And by fundraiser, everything raises funds there, but the t-shirts cost like 16, 17 bucks a piece before you buy them.
[00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:32.210]  And then the sponsor gets half, we get half, and to run all this and build a new network as a backup, you know, we're squeaking by.
[00:52:32.469 --> 00:52:39.269]  But when something says fundraiser on it, like a t-shirt that's cost double, or a poster, yeah, the poster costs five, six bucks.
[00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:43.070]  I mean, the shipping we ship it in, the special packaging costs as much as the poster itself.
[00:52:43.639 --> 00:52:49.480]  So six, seven, eight, nine bucks for the poster cost with the packaging, and then we're selling it for 25, 30 bucks.
[00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:51.400]  That's because there's some real markup in there to fund it.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:55.159]  So you know you're buying something as a memento that you really backed what we're doing.
[00:52:55.679 --> 00:52:58.980]  The campaign coins, challenge coins, they're all there.
[00:53:00.159 --> 00:53:06.519]  So the posters run from $19.95 to $29.95, and we'll have new limited edition posters after that.
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:12.320]  But the posters on January 6th will be no more.
[00:53:13.219 --> 00:53:17.940]  They're limited edition, so if you get your order in by then, you will get the poster because they're print on demand.
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:18.579]  They're in Arkansas.
[00:53:19.179 --> 00:53:21.380]  If you want one of these posters, there they are.
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.780]  And again, you've got until January 6th to get your order in.
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:27.139]  They look great hanging on the wall.
[00:53:27.139 --> 00:53:31.829]  We got them hanging here in the And I designed all of these.
[00:53:31.989 --> 00:53:37.269]  My favorite is the Trump graph that I showed the day before the election that predicted the election.
[00:53:37.429 --> 00:53:39.449]  I said, she's going to try to steal it, but it's going to fail.
[00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:44.710]  So the blue line goes up and goes straight up, but it's not enough fraud to overpower the landslide.
[00:53:44.829 --> 00:53:46.889]  And that's actually the graph that actually happened.
[00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:48.329]  The key battlegrounds.
[00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:50.269]  So you talk about nailing it, baby.
[00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:51.469]  That's my favorite.
[00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:52.409]  I designed that one.
[00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.710]  And then the 47th one I designed as well.
[00:53:54.849 --> 00:53:55.949]  So I designed those.
[00:53:56.639 --> 00:53:58.900]  I did not design the Darkest Hour one, but there it is.
[00:53:59.019 --> 00:53:59.679]  Thank you for the support.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:00.400]  I'm done plugging.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:08.400]  I've just been looking at all the attacks and our victories in court, and I realized how much money it takes to take these people on, and they are so pissed we're still on air.
[00:54:09.139 --> 00:54:11.119]  And I have hired high-powered lawyers.
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:11.940]  That's why we're winning.
[00:54:17.159 --> 00:54:22.380]  Uh, but my lawyers, uh, are working seven days a week.
[00:54:22.539 --> 00:54:24.559]  And it's, I mean, cause I go and meet with them almost every day.
[00:54:24.699 --> 00:54:26.599]  I mean, and they call me at midnight and say, come to the office.
[00:54:26.739 --> 00:54:28.360]  I want you to read this and sign it, make sure it's accurate.
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:37.159]  I mean, we are, if I told you all the suits we filed on them and all the crap we're doing to these, to bloom, you know, to the whole deep state, because I can't be on defense anymore.
[00:54:37.239 --> 00:54:37.860]  I gotta go on offense.
[00:54:38.599 --> 00:54:40.000]  It would take an hour to go over it all.
[00:54:40.559 --> 00:54:42.940]  Uh, but you want me to fight, I'm fighting.
[00:54:43.739 --> 00:54:54.000]  So, You're financing the current operation, you're financing the Backup Palace Jones Network if we get shut down, and that's still getting built and expanded, not, you know, a larger studio, almost done.
[00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:57.110]  And you're financing the legal defense and offense.
[00:54:57.369 --> 00:54:58.289]  I mean, this is a war.
[00:54:58.409 --> 00:54:59.449]  You want somebody to fight for you?
[00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:00.849]  I love it.
[00:55:01.429 --> 00:55:04.250]  I mean, I'm begging for you to keep me in the game, keep me in the fight, Coach.
[00:55:04.389 --> 00:55:05.829]  But I'm here, you're serving.
[00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:07.190]  You commission me.
[00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:14.150]  Look, I won't stop regardless of what happens, but I'm asking you to empower me, and I will give you everything I got.
[00:55:14.489 --> 00:55:20.829]  I'm so focused right now and so sick of this crap and the stuff that I've been doing to my family behind the scenes, just absolutely criminal.
[00:55:21.429 --> 00:55:24.170]  And so all I'm asking for is the support to keep fighting.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.320]  And we make it easy with incredible products, okay?
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:26.880]  I'm done.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:53.960]  By our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:58.739]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of information.
[00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:05.630]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:08.869]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:11.510]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:14.489]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:18.210]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:25.570]  The real war is here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the new world order and BlackRock.
[00:56:25.869 --> 00:56:28.909]  They have declared war on us and we accept the challenge.
[00:56:34.529 --> 00:56:38.010]  AlexJones.network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:41.829]  This is day three of the videotape demonstration of Bill Gates.
[00:56:42.889 --> 00:56:47.769]  If he didn't like what you said, he was known for responding with the words.
[00:56:47.889 --> 00:56:50.190]  Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
[00:56:51.849 --> 00:56:52.650]  That's ridiculous.
[00:56:52.929 --> 00:56:54.230]  I'm not using this thing.
[00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.969]  No, no, no, no.
[00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:55.989]  Somebody's confused.
[00:56:56.570 --> 00:56:57.550]  Somebody's just not thinking.
[00:56:57.730 --> 00:56:58.469]  I mean, there's no way.
[00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:00.829]  You guys never understood.
[00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:03.489]  You never understood the first thing about this.
[00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:07.630]  He's a multi-dimensional individual.
[00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:11.550]  He has great depth in so many different areas.
[00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:12.210]  Hi kids!
[00:57:12.469 --> 00:57:15.650]  You had a number of meetings with Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:21.369]  Well, he's dead, so, you know, in general you always have to be careful.
[00:57:23.679 --> 00:57:33.059]  And you know, today we're announcing a commitment over this next decade, which we think of as a decade of vaccines.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:39.360]  The vaccine is critical because until you have that, things aren't really going to be normal.
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:45.539]  And it won't be normal until we get An amazing vaccine to the entire world.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:58:02.260]  And for all 193 member states, you must make vaccines a high priority in your health systems to ensure that all your children have access to existing vaccines now and to the new vaccines that have recently become available.
[00:58:02.519 --> 00:58:07.219]  And keeping children alive, would that create more of a population problem?
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:11.219]  That we're pledging an additional billion dollars.
[00:58:24.119 --> 00:58:25.199]  Thank you.
[00:58:31.059 --> 00:58:32.400]  Alright, thank you.
[00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:43.190]  It's not every day we give away billions of dollars.
[00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:46.309]  My dad was head of Planned Parenthood.
[00:58:46.389 --> 00:58:48.610]  Not a Lie with Statistics by Daryl Huff.
[00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:49.929]  It's a quick read.
[00:58:50.429 --> 00:58:52.889]  It's got a lot of good examples in it.
[00:58:57.559 --> 00:59:04.699]  All right, we have a special guest joining us in 30 minutes who is one of the leading citizen journalist voices in Germany.
[00:59:05.579 --> 00:59:17.719]  She speaks great English, dealing with the globalists' attempts to ignore the now-majority party AFD. Elon Musk is fighting hard to free Germany.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:23.900]  If Germany gets free from the tyrants, the whole EU system will disappear, which is a great thing for the whole world.
[00:59:24.039 --> 00:59:26.480]  The EU was set up in 1956 where they...
[00:59:27.639 --> 00:59:35.880]  Steel Cooperative Trade Agreement, Treaty of Rome, and it's an unelected commission, and they have a parliament that's elected, but it's ceremonial.
[00:59:36.019 --> 00:59:37.280]  I mean, that is a tyranny.
[00:59:37.739 --> 00:59:39.500]  And they want to censor us.
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.380]  They're already censoring and controlling Europeans.
[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:46.619]  This is a big deal coming up.
[00:59:48.099 --> 00:59:51.420]  And it's very, very exciting.
[00:59:52.019 --> 00:59:59.219]  Same thing in the UK. The Labor Party is super unpopular, less than 20 points in opinion polls.
[00:59:59.739 --> 01:00:02.239]  Starmer's at about 15%, so they have a new election coming up.
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:03.840]  He's trying to cancel that.
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:05.579]  Trudeau's refusing to resign.
[01:00:05.699 --> 01:00:09.159]  His one party says as soon as the New Year's there and Parliament's back in, he's gone.
[01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:10.980]  I mean, they are...
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:11.780]  I could go on and on.
[01:00:12.239 --> 01:00:13.300]  This is amazing.
[01:00:13.949 --> 01:00:15.949]  And you think Trump getting elected was good.
[01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:17.889]  I mean, this is a global phenomenon.
[01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:21.150]  We are routing the globalist death cult.
[01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:25.250]  Be sure and follow me on X at Real Alex Jones in case they're able to shut down Infowars.
[01:00:25.269 --> 01:00:26.570]  It still happened in January.
[01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:31.610]  Be sure and follow me on X at AJN for Alex Jones Network at AJN Live.
[01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:33.010]  We'll be right back.
[01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:33.469]  Stay with us.
[01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:42.760]  We are now into our number two of this Christmas Eve special transmission on December 24th, 2024. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:44.500]  Very blessed and honored to be here.
[01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:46.539]  Very thankful for you, the viewers and listeners.
[01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:51.969]  For enabling this operation against the globalists to continue.
[01:00:52.489 --> 01:01:00.510]  And all of our fabulous success is temporarily, meaning of this earth, due to you.
[01:01:00.809 --> 01:01:07.070]  And that goes to the crew, my family, our supporters, our sponsors, but really the listeners and viewers.
[01:01:07.369 --> 01:01:16.469]  And I just keep repeating that because I want you to understand that you are the reason the tide has turned.
[01:01:17.429 --> 01:01:20.130]  You are the reason we're in a winning position now.
[01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:24.050]  We haven't won yet, but we're winning almost all the major battles now.
[01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:46.349]  But again, with that comes the extreme danger of the globalists who know that they're losing power and know that they're going to be prosecuted from starting a nuclear war,
[01:01:47.519 --> 01:01:49.539]  Doing a giant cyber attack blaming on the Russians.
[01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:53.719]  They've all pre-positioned and pre-programmed and gotten that ready.
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:02:00.860]  And you see all the pre-programming and you've seen me literally say, this will happen then.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.300]  Then this will happen next.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.199]  And then they will do that.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.079]  And then they will say this.
[01:02:04.519 --> 01:02:11.980]  And then people are like, a year ago, oh yeah, alright, if Trump wins, Biden will start bombing Russia with attack on missiles.
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.900]  They were already preparing it.
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:14.880]  They were already talking about it.
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:16.699]  Getting it ready.
[01:02:18.059 --> 01:02:20.840]  They weren't saying we'll do it if Trump wins, but I was saying, why aren't they doing it now?
[01:02:21.219 --> 01:02:23.760]  A lot of their data points go into each point I make.
[01:02:25.039 --> 01:02:26.659]  And you saw that happen.
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:31.900]  I don't sit up here and say this stuff to sound scary.
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:49.449]  I say it so that the public's aware people can look into it and it matriculates into Congress and into the governorships and into other governments and other intelligence agencies and people that are compartmentalized The mid-level officer corps,
[01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:53.030]  because a lot of them are good, the top people are pretty much all bad, General Flynn will tell you that.
[01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:57.090]  They've been getting mainly globalists in for 30, 40 years, and now it's almost complete.
[01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:03.309]  But the colonels down are good people, some of the best, and the enlisted folks are great.
[01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:05.150]  But the general public always...
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:14.039]  I see it everywhere, and people said to me on the street, they go, oh my god, the Navy SEALs, they know everything, or the Delta Force, they know all the secrets.
[01:03:14.559 --> 01:03:20.059]  Well, they know compartmentalize who they were sent to kill, or who they were sent to torture.
[01:03:23.039 --> 01:03:26.820]  They know the secrets of their little mission.
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.940]  I'm not saying they're little, but that little piece.
[01:03:30.619 --> 01:03:32.860]  They don't know the 35,000 foot view.
[01:03:34.809 --> 01:03:36.510]  Because they're not read into it.
[01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:37.789]  Well, I've reverse engineered it.
[01:03:37.949 --> 01:03:39.309]  My guests are reverse engineered it.
[01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:40.010]  This is all I do.
[01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:46.170]  I have the 35,000 foot view and I have the one inch view and the microscopic view.
[01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:52.730]  And all I do is read the globalist own internal documents that leak and come out over the years.
[01:03:53.889 --> 01:04:08.269]  And They don't like the fact that I'm up here decompartmentalizing people because even most of the top people in the managerial class of the globalists are not generalist experts in this.
[01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:30.789]  And you've got to have a general knowledge of everything and then understand the globalists' larger real plan versus the plan they give their minions versus the fake plan they give the public And so I'm here raising the curtain up behind the little man behind it.
[01:04:30.929 --> 01:04:31.710]  I'm just Toto.
[01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:33.750]  That's who you are as well.
[01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:35.710]  But we have courage, the little dog.
[01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:39.949]  And so that's where we are.
[01:04:41.309 --> 01:04:45.349]  And understanding that is understanding how to beat the enemy.
[01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.929]  They cannot survive exposure.
[01:04:49.909 --> 01:05:06.889]  They wouldn't be going through all this hell to try to intimidate and sue and de-platform and de-bank and kill and imprison pro-human moral patriots around the world if they had it all sewn up.
[01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:10.369]  And I know most of you are saying, well, that's common sense.
[01:05:10.449 --> 01:05:10.829]  We know that.
[01:05:10.969 --> 01:05:14.789]  Well, the public's starting to wake up, but they don't understand the big picture yet.
[01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:17.989]  Because it is scary and it's hard to believe, but it's there.
[01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:18.409]  It's real.
[01:05:22.559 --> 01:05:25.699]  So, the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:35.460]  And I remember even reading in Financial Times of London, where the establishment was being honest about things a decade ago, and they said, if Trump wins, it'll be the end of the world government.
[01:05:36.139 --> 01:05:38.019]  And they said, well, if he wins again, for sure.
[01:05:38.179 --> 01:05:39.679]  And you see, it's their end.
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:48.820]  I mean, these guys have committed such financial crimes that, again, they make Bernie Madoff look moral.
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:53.480]  They make Ponzi look like a amateur.
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:58.579]  They make Sam Beekman Freed look like a choir boy.
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:07.739]  And I understand why people don't want to admit this.
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:30.610]  It's really hard to read all the official documents and admissions and plans and programs That they even put in movies like V for Vendetta or TV series like Utopia where they tell you what they're going to do to you.
[01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:31.409]  Do the shots.
[01:06:31.909 --> 01:06:32.869]  And then they do it.
[01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:54.460]  And then they just think it's so horrible what they've done and they've got the medical establishment By and large, go along with it, that people that have been corrupted by it will then, when the moment of truth comes out, they're faced with reality, will double down and join with it consciously because they're embarrassed about what they've been part of.
[01:06:54.579 --> 01:06:55.960]  And then that's how evil works.
[01:06:56.139 --> 01:06:58.880]  Once it's got you, well, then you'll do anything.
[01:07:04.019 --> 01:07:07.579]  And, you know, to a certain extent, that would work in the past when there was still so much prosperity.
[01:07:09.579 --> 01:07:12.139]  But under the globalist model, that's come to an end.
[01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:30.840]  So, even from a sociopathic perspective, and I've talked a lot about this, this moment we're now in, where when we start turning the tide, and I believe in humanity, I bet on you, and we've now done it,
[01:07:31.579 --> 01:07:46.719]  You see a lot of opportunists from the power structure that really weren't on their program, but were just going along with it for their own personal power and wealth, would join us because they could see we were winning and that that's how the collapse of the globalists would move even quicker.
[01:07:47.179 --> 01:08:05.800]  And I said, when people that have just been mercenaries for the system flip over to our side, we don't ever trust them, we don't turn our backs on them, but we let them come in Because that ensures the victory very quickly.
[01:08:07.659 --> 01:08:10.320]  And that's happening.
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:36.359]  And you got a lot of people that have been fighting the globalists for decades who see all this stuff happening and cannot believe it's so good and they can't articulate how it's a trick and they can't articulate how we aren't starting to win and making major headway and They just discredit themselves by those actions.
[01:08:38.159 --> 01:08:40.960]  Because they can't believe that we can win.
[01:08:41.119 --> 01:08:42.800]  They can't believe that there's good in the universe.
[01:08:44.479 --> 01:08:47.020]  They can't believe that we can turn the tide.
[01:08:48.039 --> 01:08:56.560]  Well, people don't like having their lifestyle taken away.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.640]  People don't like being locked up.
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:01.840]  People don't like being the bad guys, most of them.
[01:09:02.689 --> 01:09:08.069]  They were just waiting for you to have courage and for us to build critical mass so that all the fence sitters would join us.
[01:09:09.489 --> 01:09:14.609]  And we hit critical mass in the last six, seven years.
[01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:26.829]  And the system used all its tricks and all the things up its sleeve to try to maintain control and they could do it for a moment, but any moment where they slowed us down only catapulted the resistance in the future.
[01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:33.119]  I like it in trying to hold a beach ball down at the deep end of the pool.
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:44.460]  You might be a really strong swimmer and you grab that beach ball and you kick down to the bottom and you're holding it, but no matter if you're an Olympic swimmer with 10 gold medals, you're not going to be able to hold it down there very long.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:58.800]  And that's the losing proposition because once there's a critical mass of understanding about how the globalist tricks and formulas of deception operate, once we have the knowledge of evil, Meaning we know how they're operating.
[01:10:00.399 --> 01:10:06.680]  Then we can promote the knowledge of good and the alternate system and people will join us out of self-preservation.
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:11.479]  So I did envision this and I did tell you decades ago it was coming.
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:15.319]  And God gives us chances.
[01:10:18.159 --> 01:10:23.500]  So I would recommend you thank God every day, every minute, every hour.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.180]  I know I'm constantly just thank you God.
[01:10:25.279 --> 01:10:26.060]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:34.630]  And even if we weren't having these big victories right now, I know the Holy Spirit tells me to do this, that it's going to be a victory in the future, and that the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:35.670]  I just have total faith in God.
[01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:45.270]  I could pull up a red light today, and they send some assassin that rolls down their window, and I see a gun pointed at me, and the flash, and my head's blown off.
[01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:50.930]  In that millisecond, I'm just saying, I love you, Jesus, because I know it's God's plan.
[01:10:51.109 --> 01:10:53.569]  I don't believe in God.
[01:10:54.619 --> 01:10:56.119]  I don't trust in God.
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.060]  Those words are too weak.
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:02.140]  I am fully committed, 100%.
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:03.859]  No questions.
[01:11:04.319 --> 01:11:05.739]  It's God's plan.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.039]  I love God.
[01:11:07.039 --> 01:11:08.420]  I am with God.
[01:11:08.619 --> 01:11:11.100]  I am literally interfacing with God.
[01:11:11.239 --> 01:11:13.539]  And whatever God does, it's God's plan.
[01:11:13.659 --> 01:11:18.659]  And I am absolutely, totally, beyond 100% committed to it.
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.800]  I never blame God.
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.199]  I never get mad at God.
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:25.819]  I never ask God, why are you doing this to me?
[01:11:29.979 --> 01:11:31.399]  Because God is teaching me.
[01:11:32.079 --> 01:11:34.279]  And teaching others, and it's part of a larger plan.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.520]  So we don't surrender to Satan.
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.479]  We don't surrender to Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.159]  We don't surrender to Barack Obama.
[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:43.039]  We don't surrender to Anthony Fauci.
[01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:45.319]  We don't surrender to Keira Starmer.
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.319]  We don't surrender to Xi Jinping.
[01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:51.770]  We don't surrender to Trump.
[01:11:53.170 --> 01:11:54.829]  We don't surrender to Rand Paul.
[01:11:55.149 --> 01:11:56.750]  We don't surrender to Alex Jones.
[01:11:56.970 --> 01:11:58.609]  We don't surrender to Tucker Carlson.
[01:11:59.329 --> 01:12:08.289]  We surrender to Jesus Christ and His Father and His Holy Spirit.
[01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:15.289]  I have totally surrendered.
[01:12:19.829 --> 01:12:28.529]  And it is the most empowering, perfect, delicious thing I've ever experienced.
[01:12:28.829 --> 01:12:36.510]  Nothing, nothing, nothing even comes 1% close.
[01:12:38.829 --> 01:12:51.810]  And my only frustration is that I am a fleshly fallen creature, and I slip out of gear, like everyone does, back into the sinful nature, back into the flesh, but less and less, and for shorter and shorter period of time, I'll catch myself.
[01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:56.829]  And I ask, whoa.
[01:12:57.930 --> 01:13:00.989]  Holy Spirit, I can't do this.
[01:13:00.989 --> 01:13:01.970]  I need you right now.
[01:13:02.170 --> 01:13:02.949]  And it's just...
[01:13:06.329 --> 01:13:07.470]  I don't have control.
[01:13:08.109 --> 01:13:09.369]  God has control.
[01:13:10.449 --> 01:13:13.810]  He who is in me is greater than he who is in the world.
[01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:16.750]  And that's why they don't like me.
[01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:21.739]  Because they know They know our God isn't some wimp.
[01:13:22.119 --> 01:13:27.279]  They know our God isn't this fake Hollywood image of Christians that are a bunch of cowardly pieces of crap.
[01:13:27.819 --> 01:13:29.859]  Our God is the God.
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:36.779]  Our God created all the wonderment, all the discovery, all the pleasure, all the power!
[01:13:39.659 --> 01:13:41.439]  You want to give God another name?
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.380]  How about total power?
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.300]  That's the power!
[01:13:46.869 --> 01:13:49.289]  Not this dumbass Satan loser.
[01:13:52.369 --> 01:13:54.029]  Satan's the cosmic loser.
[01:13:55.569 --> 01:13:56.590]  Satan's a joke.
[01:13:58.270 --> 01:14:02.989]  And the only thing, a bigger joke than Satan, is anybody that goes along with him.
[01:14:03.069 --> 01:14:04.590]  But most people never knew what hit him.
[01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:09.050]  And it's our job to explain to him the devil's 100% real.
[01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:12.890]  It's not some metaphorical metaphor, some archetypal thing.
[01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:14.010]  It's a real spirit.
[01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:16.529]  It's a real thing in the universe.
[01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:18.829]  And you got free will, baby.
[01:14:19.609 --> 01:14:23.770]  And if you want to jack into the devil, he's ready to stick it in you.
[01:14:26.890 --> 01:14:28.310]  And I'll tell you, point blank.
[01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:33.729]  Our spiritual nature is sexual.
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.439]  That's why all the Aleister Crowley stuff is sex magic.
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.359]  That's why all the Satan cults of sex.
[01:14:39.479 --> 01:14:40.920]  It's an abomination of it.
[01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:44.960]  God gave us men, gave us women, gave us our lives, gave us that.
[01:14:46.039 --> 01:14:48.899]  It's our main driver is procreation and creation.
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:49.779]  God loves life.
[01:14:49.899 --> 01:14:53.039]  God made it fun, but in God's confines.
[01:14:53.619 --> 01:15:00.359]  And the spiritual relationship with God is sexual.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:06.079]  And I don't mean playing with yourself.
[01:15:06.319 --> 01:15:09.260]  I mean, it's the relationship between a man and a woman.
[01:15:10.899 --> 01:15:12.439]  That's what Christ said.
[01:15:12.739 --> 01:15:13.920]  And it's true.
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:18.500]  I'm God's bitch.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.420]  And that's what this comes down to.
[01:15:23.899 --> 01:15:27.180]  And if you ain't God's bitch, you're Satan's bitch.
[01:15:27.399 --> 01:15:29.140]  And he's going to treat you like a pimp.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.060]  He's going to treat you bad.
[01:15:33.090 --> 01:15:36.689]  So, everybody better ask themselves right now, who is your daddy?
[01:15:37.489 --> 01:15:39.470]  Well, my daddy's the creator of the universe.
[01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:40.829]  My daddy made me.
[01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:41.909]  My daddy loves me.
[01:15:43.149 --> 01:15:48.970]  All of you people out there playing with Satan are like somebody sticking their finger in a light socket.
[01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:50.390]  You're idiots.
[01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:51.689]  All right, I'm done ranting.
[01:15:52.989 --> 01:15:53.949]  I got a bunch of news, dude.
[01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:54.510]  All right.
[01:15:55.289 --> 01:15:56.390]  It's now cresting.
[01:15:56.529 --> 01:15:59.250]  Lawsuits have been filed by the Daily Wire and a bunch of other groups.
[01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:01.829]  And Elon Musk has filed suits over it.
[01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:03.789]  A lot of other journalistic groups have filed suits.
[01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:06.250]  Because it turns out thousands of people are on the list.
[01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.930]  We're on the list.
[01:16:09.729 --> 01:16:10.729]  People say, why don't you file a suit?
[01:16:10.810 --> 01:16:11.989]  Well, if we had the money, we would.
[01:16:12.069 --> 01:16:13.930]  We're fighting as many things as we can right now.
[01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:15.770]  And that's coming.
[01:16:16.609 --> 01:16:18.609]  Hell, if somebody writes a check right now, it'll happen next week.
[01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:21.750]  So, it's up to you how hard I fight.
[01:16:21.850 --> 01:16:22.529]  That's how this works.
[01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:24.529]  Like a garden, up to you.
[01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:30.630]  You go hoe the land and put the fertilizer in and plant the seeds and knock the bugs off, and then you get all that badass stuff growing out there.
[01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:33.529]  I mean, this is a symbiotic relationship here.
[01:16:35.529 --> 01:16:39.869]  And in the archetype, we are the man, and the soil and the plants are the woman.
[01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:40.949]  It's the same thing.
[01:16:41.010 --> 01:16:41.949]  The whole universe is like that.
[01:16:43.829 --> 01:16:46.850]  So, it's perfect.
[01:16:49.149 --> 01:16:49.909]  The yin and the yang.
[01:16:52.770 --> 01:16:54.630]  And so this is all starting to get a lot of attention.
[01:16:54.789 --> 01:16:57.710]  And here's one of the Trump advisors.
[01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:06.010]  Dr. Jan Halpert talking about what we've been talking about forever, but it's now a big topic, thank God.
[01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:17.930]  Wow, they're kind of a big topic that the State Department and the CIA and the Defense Departments involve brainwashing and lying to the public and releasing viruses and scaring the crap out of us and financing disinformation campaigns and PR operations and law firms.
[01:17:18.069 --> 01:17:18.750]  It's illegal as hell.
[01:17:21.630 --> 01:17:27.909]  And so one of the first things Trump needs to do is not just cut the money out of these agencies, he needs to prosecute the living hell out of these people.
[01:17:29.279 --> 01:17:30.520]  So here she is talking about it.
[01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:37.300]  And that is part of why we have this corrupt media.
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:44.260]  You could go to Wikipedia and find Operation Mockingbird, that the CIA has been in there forever.
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:54.380]  Then Obama repealed the 1948 Smith-Munt Act, which then permitted propaganda to be in broadcasting.
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:57.279]  It no longer said that it had to be credible.
[01:17:57.710 --> 01:18:06.069]  And so when he came out and said fake news, he warned us at the end of his speech that it is going to be very hard.
[01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:10.750]  The establishment, the media, the globalists are all going to come after.
[01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:14.949]  They're going to try to intimidate, but he needed to smoke them out.
[01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:15.989]  And guess what happened?
[01:18:16.210 --> 01:18:22.739]  The next day, Congress on the Democrat side wanted to create a law that he couldn't run.
[01:18:23.119 --> 01:18:29.399]  Then what happened was the Republicans came out and said they were going to investigate Hunter Biden.
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:40.319]  And Friday, the Department of Justice, AG, launched an investigation and he put the most corrupt prosecutor who hates Trump on it.
[01:18:41.909 --> 01:18:52.090]  Donald Trump actually plays chess on a 5D level and you never can anticipate what his next move is going to be.
[01:18:52.449 --> 01:19:05.170]  The reason that his Mar-a-Lago was seized upon was that they really wanted to get the PEDS, the Presidential Emergency Act.
[01:19:05.939 --> 01:19:12.539]  Document, which is only what Trump knows and the military that he had to put in place.
[01:19:12.779 --> 01:19:17.420]  Because before he left, he declared two national emergencies.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:18.720]  And you know what?
[01:19:18.939 --> 01:19:20.500]  Biden hasn't reversed that.
[01:19:20.859 --> 01:19:25.600]  Biden has signed on to three of his executive orders to continue them going.
[01:19:25.859 --> 01:19:30.279]  So we have some very fascinating things that are going to come out.
[01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:35.550]  Alright, now I'm going to play another clip here, talking about lying in the media.
[01:19:36.930 --> 01:19:47.750]  Here is the current head of NPR, CRO, Catherine Mayer, explaining that we don't need to tell the truth here.
[01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:49.750]  No, no, no, it's a problem.
[01:19:49.989 --> 01:19:52.909]  So they've been caught lying, so they're trying to say, well, we lie for your own good.
[01:19:52.909 --> 01:19:53.350]  Here it is.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:20:06.439]  But one of the most significant differences, critical for moving from polarization to productivity, is that the Wikipedians who write these articles aren't actually focused on finding the truth.
[01:20:07.239 --> 01:20:13.260]  They're working for something that's a little bit more attainable, which is the best of what we can know right now.
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.619]  And after seven years there, I actually believe that they're onto something.
[01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:26.659]  That for our most tricky disagreements, seeking the truth and seeking to convince others of the truth isn't necessarily the best place to start.
[01:20:27.319 --> 01:20:39.300]  In fact, I think our reverence for the truth might have become a bit of a distraction that is preventing us from finding consensus and getting important things done.
[01:20:41.229 --> 01:20:43.189]  None of that's to say that the truth isn't important.
[01:20:43.409 --> 01:20:50.409]  The search for the truth is at the core of some of our greatest human achievements.
[01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:55.569]  It can animate and inspire us to do, learn and create great things.
[01:20:56.449 --> 01:21:05.789]  But I think in our messy human hearts, we also know that the truth is something of a fickle mistress, and that the beauty of the truth is actually often in the struggle.
[01:21:06.250 --> 01:21:14.250]  It's the reason that we have so many sublime chronicles of the human experience, because there are so many different truths to be explored.
[01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:19.949]  And so in this spirit, I know that the truth exists for each of you in this room.
[01:21:20.409 --> 01:21:23.390]  It also probably exists for the person sitting next to you.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:27.500]  But the thing is, the two of you don't necessarily have the same truths.
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:34.960]  And this is because for many of us, truth is what we make when we merge facts about the world with our beliefs about the world.
[01:21:35.579 --> 01:21:38.600]  Each of us has our own truth, and it's probably a good one.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.960]  So that didn't make any sense, it's not meant to.
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:44.960]  That's what a cult does when it's brainwashing you.
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:48.000]  First off, all NPR does is lie and spin.
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:52.020]  So first off, oh, we've all been telling the truth, but that's not working.
[01:21:52.779 --> 01:21:56.579]  So now we need to not be truthful.
[01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:02.680]  Or, yeah, because they're the ones teaching there's no X and Y chromosomes.
[01:22:04.279 --> 01:22:07.840]  I mean, it's just, this is final stage collapse of these people.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.039]  Oh, we're caught lying.
[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:12.460]  Well, we're only lying for your own good, though we did tell the truth before.
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.579]  Just lies upon lies upon lies.
[01:22:15.359 --> 01:22:18.500]  And the idiot woman's reading off a teleprompter and acts like a retarded robot.

[01:23:49.569 --> 01:23:51.569]  The U.S. trustee's still been left there, though it was over.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:56.000]  The judge said you're actually gonna sell it to who actually offers the most money.
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:24:01.760]  We're gonna work on that with outside groups that won't censor us, but who knows what Soros and Bloomberg are gonna do.
[01:24:02.699 --> 01:24:04.399]  But regardless, we continue on.
[01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:05.539]  The Infowar is you.
[01:24:05.619 --> 01:24:05.960]  It's me.
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:06.640]  It's the people.
[01:24:06.659 --> 01:24:07.399]  It's questioning.
[01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:08.199]  It's researching.
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:09.279]  It's promoting liberty.
[01:24:09.439 --> 01:24:10.600]  It's resisting tyranny.

[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:45.000]  Merry Christmas!
[01:24:48.699 --> 01:24:51.279]  Coming up here in just a few minutes, Naomi Zyped.
[01:24:52.150 --> 01:25:01.850]  The sensation out of Germany, who's here in the United States, will be joining us to talk about the battle against the globalists of the EU that is so important to bring the world from the new world order.
[01:25:03.170 --> 01:25:12.750]  But here she is months ago when they were trying to shut us down and predicting that Trump was going to be victorious, that we were going to be victorious.
[01:25:12.850 --> 01:25:13.569]  She was certainly right.
[01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:17.630]  And she was reaching millions and millions of people a day back then.
[01:25:17.710 --> 01:25:19.470]  Now she's reaching tens of millions a day.
[01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:26.989]  And the same deep state still trying to shut us down now, but we'll keep fighting.
[01:25:27.710 --> 01:25:28.750]  We'll never give up.
[01:25:28.810 --> 01:25:31.430]  And as long as you stand with us, we'll be here.
[01:25:31.609 --> 01:25:32.630]  Here's what she had to say.
[01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:39.909]  The Onion just acquired Infowars, and I read their article on why they chose to waste their money.
[01:25:40.109 --> 01:25:43.329]  And it's as dramatic and pathetic as you can possibly imagine.
[01:25:43.649 --> 01:25:54.850]  They're claiming that Infowars has been manipulating and brainwashing the minds for so many years They felt it was their duty to invest in this opportunity to say fuck you to Alex Jones once and for all.
[01:25:55.329 --> 01:25:56.449]  Well that's gonna backfire.
[01:25:56.670 --> 01:26:07.489]  Honestly to me it sounds a lot like a lack of self-reflection and possibly protection as their own attempts to spread fake news and fear-mongering have failed.
[01:26:08.069 --> 01:26:10.789]  Donald Trump is the president-elect.
[01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:13.779]  And this is why they are being so petty right now.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:19.439]  They feel like they have to come back at us and punch us in the face, but it's barely scratching us.
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:21.319]  It's barely scratching us at this point.
[01:26:21.479 --> 01:26:31.039]  And the same goes for Alex Jones, because the one thing that you're forgetting apparently, you're completely ignorant to the fact that you just bought Infowars.
[01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:33.640]  But you cannot buy Alex Jones.
[01:26:33.979 --> 01:26:36.659]  You cannot buy the voice of the people.
[01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:42.569]  The voice of the people because we enjoyed Infowars for Alex Jones.
[01:26:43.069 --> 01:26:47.390]  Meaning that whatever Alex Jones is going to do next, we are still here with him.
[01:26:47.649 --> 01:26:48.970]  We're not following you.
[01:26:49.630 --> 01:26:50.829]  Infowars is yours now.
[01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:52.050]  Alright, goodbye.
[01:26:52.449 --> 01:26:55.369]  We take on Alex Jones 2.0.
[01:26:56.010 --> 01:26:57.890]  Why do you think Trump won?
[01:26:58.789 --> 01:27:00.430]  It's because of people like you.
[01:27:00.829 --> 01:27:03.029]  People who kept attacking him.
[01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:09.710]  Who punched down when he was on the ground and he came back stronger and he's gonna do it every time.
[01:27:10.409 --> 01:27:12.630]  Do you think Alex Jones is weak?
[01:27:12.970 --> 01:27:17.090]  Do you think he will submit to your pressure?
[01:27:17.729 --> 01:27:19.050]  There is no pressure.
[01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:20.810]  You have achieved nothing.
[01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:22.329]  You wasted your money.
[01:27:23.409 --> 01:27:24.289]  We win.
[01:27:24.710 --> 01:27:26.369]  You can claim that you won.
[01:27:27.670 --> 01:27:31.569]  Keep living in your fairy tale because that's what leftism is all about.
[01:27:31.989 --> 01:27:40.430]  Living in a privileged bubble of imaginary tales, fear mongering, and then in the end claiming that you won.
[01:27:40.869 --> 01:27:41.710]  Claim your victory.
[01:27:41.989 --> 01:27:52.510]  Go ahead, live in your bubble, live in your safe space, far away from the rest of us who are fighting to make America great again.
[01:27:54.289 --> 01:27:58.090]  That's Naomi Zipes will be in studio with us late next week.
[01:27:59.789 --> 01:28:01.210]  She's coming up soon.
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:07.520]  Here's some footage of her shooting.
[01:28:08.579 --> 01:28:10.119]  I love ladies shooting guns, don't you?
[01:28:16.619 --> 01:28:17.659]  She'll get the hang of it.
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:19.600]  Maybe we should take her shooting.
[01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:22.539]  Alright.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:29.720]  Look, I'm not ready to give an update yet on what's going on with the future of M4s.
[01:28:29.779 --> 01:28:30.640]  It's worse than ever.
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:37.760]  And you can probably put two and two together, but there's a reason I'm not telling you.
[01:28:39.079 --> 01:28:46.840]  The Justice Department, the incoming Justice Department, doesn't want the public to know this quite yet.
[01:28:47.439 --> 01:28:50.739]  But our little friends are in for some big surprises.
[01:28:53.399 --> 01:29:02.060]  And I told you the last three times they tried to shut us down, it was illegal, didn't I? Well, what do you think these bozo the clowns are doing now?
[01:29:03.739 --> 01:29:09.140]  Knowing the left, do they so far ever give up when they get caught?
[01:29:09.439 --> 01:29:14.939]  Imagine how desperate they are, three times trying to shut us down, failing in the last seven months.
[01:29:18.199 --> 01:29:21.020]  What do you think they're doing right now?
[01:29:22.819 --> 01:29:24.479]  Fighting harder than ever.
[01:29:27.779 --> 01:29:31.539]  And doing stuff way worse than they've ever done before.
[01:29:34.739 --> 01:29:38.340]  And let's just say a lot of documents have come out.
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:58.279]  I've been waiting for this a long time, my little green friend.
[01:30:00.399 --> 01:30:01.140]  So...
[01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:10.100]  That said, I understand for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:30:14.039 --> 01:30:28.039]  So I'm being particularly careful because these things must be done delicately.
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:36.989]  But yeah, if I relish the bad guys Screwing the pooch.
[01:30:37.770 --> 01:30:40.090]  I think God will forgive me that little sin.
[01:30:41.569 --> 01:30:42.869]  After all, he made me.
[01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:46.630]  And knows my heart.
[01:30:50.010 --> 01:30:51.829]  How did God make King David?
[01:30:51.949 --> 01:30:52.510]  What did God say?
[01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:56.270]  He said, I made him to be a man after my own heart.
[01:31:03.409 --> 01:31:07.560]  So, Finishing up with some big news here before our guest joins us.
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.279]  Remember this story a year ago?
[01:31:11.539 --> 01:31:23.000]  And I noticed even in the alternative media, the patriot media, the real new media, I didn't really see anybody talking about this, but I saw it in the comments on Real Alex Jones when I posted these articles yesterday afternoon.
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:31.039]  And I just love the knowledge of the crowd because basically everybody was saying, well, wait a minute.
[01:31:33.399 --> 01:31:43.039]  A year ago, they bust these two model poster boys, two gay men that had their adopted kids that have been kidnapped from Christian families as usual.
[01:31:45.939 --> 01:31:49.539]  And then they were raping them when they were little kids.
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:32:01.420]  They're still little, but trained them as sex slaves and were loaning them out to Democrat operatives in Georgia and to the trendy, you know, gay slash pedo cult.
[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:02.020]  Sex ring.
[01:32:03.609 --> 01:32:05.229]  So we can put some screenshots of that up.
[01:32:06.449 --> 01:32:13.090]  And we got shots of them with the two kidnapped kids that the state handed over to them.
[01:32:13.489 --> 01:32:16.689]  And of course, a lot of these groups are smart enough not to rape the kids.
[01:32:16.810 --> 01:32:19.029]  They just put them on chemicals and cut their genitals off.
[01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:21.130]  It's all about destroying innocents.
[01:32:21.310 --> 01:32:22.109]  They get a thrill out of that.
[01:32:22.329 --> 01:32:24.170]  It's pressing on the nerve of Satanism.
[01:32:25.850 --> 01:32:29.310]  They both kind of look like Eric Swallowswell, like brothers of Swallowswell.
[01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:31.399]  Love my family.
[01:32:31.579 --> 01:32:47.060]  So there's the two sex slave children that they had in a big Democrat sex ring, and then they were busted a year ago, a little over a year ago, 12 and a half months ago, and they finally had their trial,
[01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:52.260]  and they were given 100 years with no parole in Georgia, which I think's a little...
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.960]  This is the Democrats that were taken back over.
[01:32:56.079 --> 01:33:00.300]  They'll probably pardon them and make them the deputy or heads of HHS or something.
[01:33:00.579 --> 01:33:01.520]  Or the Department of Education.
[01:33:01.699 --> 01:33:02.199]  I'm not even joking.
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:05.479]  Biden just pardoned a bunch of serial killers and people yesterday, as you know.
[01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:16.380]  And so these two pedophiles, convicted pedophiles, were pimping the sex slaves out.
[01:33:17.819 --> 01:33:19.819]  And a year later...
[01:33:21.010 --> 01:33:22.170]  And it's in the police documents.
[01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:28.430]  They confirmed, and they reportedly had videos and photos of all this and a list of people that were raping the children.
[01:33:30.810 --> 01:33:34.409]  And a year later, where are the other indictments?
[01:33:39.489 --> 01:33:43.289]  Because I've read a whole bunch of corporate media and watched newscasts about this.
[01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:44.170]  I've looked for a while.
[01:33:44.529 --> 01:33:45.270]  Maybe it's there.
[01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:45.909]  I missed it.
[01:33:47.710 --> 01:33:53.350]  It's like an illegal alien deported by Trump, comes back, Biden lets him in, he burns a woman to death, and the corporate media won't say he's an illegal alien.
[01:33:53.649 --> 01:33:55.449]  Hell, at first they just had the woman burst into flames.
[01:33:57.409 --> 01:33:58.050]  It's the same thing.
[01:33:58.069 --> 01:34:00.930]  Oh, a car killed a bunch of people in Germany at a Christmas festival.
[01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:06.510]  Zachary Zulock and William Zulock.
[01:34:08.829 --> 01:34:11.909]  I don't think they're going to last too long in the pen.
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:18.079]  Something tells me they're going to get their brains beat out here pretty quick.
[01:34:22.199 --> 01:34:23.760]  Now, California's passed laws.
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:25.840]  You can rape 12-year-old boys, and it's okay.
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:32.560]  But other than places like that, the vast majority of people, like 99%, are against this crap.
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:35.279]  But these people just think they're invincible.
[01:34:35.659 --> 01:34:39.600]  The LGBTs Satan system is about that.
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:40.840]  It's about destroying innocence.
[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:41.920]  It's about pedophilia.
[01:34:42.359 --> 01:34:43.659]  It's about transgenderism.
[01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:46.630]  It's about pedophile rings.
[01:34:49.229 --> 01:34:56.810]  It's about that CIA operation, West Germany, from the 60s into the 90s, with 30,000-plus children placed with convicted pedophiles to create a, quote, new culture.
[01:34:57.710 --> 01:34:58.789]  It's the same thing everywhere.
[01:34:58.869 --> 01:35:01.210]  They do it with the Boy Scouts with it, the Catholic Church with it.
[01:35:01.710 --> 01:35:02.529]  It's a program.
[01:35:02.670 --> 01:35:03.369]  It's how you take over society.
[01:35:04.050 --> 01:35:10.810]  Came out in the news, the CIA put most of the mayors in, or the village leaders in Afghanistan who were pedophiles.
[01:35:11.479 --> 01:35:12.680]  Because they can control them that way.
[01:35:12.939 --> 01:35:14.779]  This is what your evil government does.
[01:35:14.939 --> 01:35:16.319]  Jeffrey Epstein's just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:20.180]  Yeah, it's not just 30,000 potential suspects.
[01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:21.880]  It was over 30,000 kids placed as well.
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:27.060]  And Jeremy, this is one of the biggest rings ever busted and, of course, government run with the German and U.S. government.
[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:30.500]  So...
[01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:36.779]  Why...
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:42.060]  Are we not seeing indictments?
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:53.979]  And I don't think I'm saying that the Trump administration, when locals don't do their job, that's when the feds constitutionally get involved.
[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:57.420]  It's a federal crime to be pimping kids out, not just a state crime.
[01:36:01.039 --> 01:36:11.890]  And There needs to be a federal investigation into this ring, which they admit they were big buddies with prominent Democrats and the LGBT cult.
[01:36:12.130 --> 01:36:23.109]  And that's why, just like Epstein, it's a guarded list and nobody's getting indicted because the system's protecting them.
[01:36:26.369 --> 01:36:31.750]  And I would imagine before the prison inmates get to these guys, the deep state will probably kill them.
[01:36:31.869 --> 01:36:34.170]  They'll probably hang themselves like Jeffrey Epstein very quickly.
[01:36:36.210 --> 01:36:42.390]  So they need to be put in solitary confinement until they can be interrogated by the Trump Justice Department.
[01:36:43.710 --> 01:36:55.270]  And everybody in Georgia and other places sees a lot of fire politically under the ash of the state police and the locals and say, where are the other indictments?
[01:37:02.430 --> 01:37:08.109]  Reportedly, they sold them out to hundreds of Democrat pedophiles.
[01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:11.729]  So, it's like a Christmas sweater.
[01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:14.329]  You grab one string, you keep pulling, and the whole thing unravels.
[01:37:14.449 --> 01:37:19.770]  And then you got Holman coming in, and you've got Mayorkas.
[01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:24.630]  Oh, it's not my job to know where the kidnapped kids are.
[01:37:24.649 --> 01:37:35.739]  I just did it and shipped them in and delivered them to another agency, HHS. I know nothing like Sergeant Schultz says in Hogan's Heroes.
[01:37:38.239 --> 01:37:45.159]  His arrogant, pedophile-enabling ass, and he looks like a pedophile, he acts like a pedophile.
[01:37:45.319 --> 01:37:48.199]  I don't know if he's a pedophile, but...
[01:37:48.199 --> 01:37:53.270]  I mean, I... I'd bet the farm he is.
[01:37:53.409 --> 01:37:57.770]  I mean, you know, if he had like a truth detector, you know, or if he was given truth serum.
[01:37:58.329 --> 01:38:01.390]  But he sure as hell supplies kids for pedophiles and sex rings.
[01:38:01.529 --> 01:38:02.430]  That's come out in the Senate reports.
[01:38:03.289 --> 01:38:05.210]  He sure covers up the tracks of it.
[01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:09.050]  Ends the DNA testing, all the rest of it.
[01:38:10.130 --> 01:38:15.529]  Gives them to people on airfields and Walmart parking lots in the middle of nowhere.
[01:38:17.789 --> 01:38:21.390]  So, he's certainly one of the biggest pedophile enablers in history.
[01:38:22.350 --> 01:38:23.750]  If not the biggest ever.
[01:38:23.909 --> 01:38:24.949]  I can't think of anybody bigger.
[01:38:26.329 --> 01:38:27.869]  Imagine, it's probably worse than that.
[01:38:27.970 --> 01:38:28.970]  I'm sure he's not the biggest.
[01:38:30.789 --> 01:38:32.289]  But he's certainly up there.
[01:38:35.090 --> 01:38:37.789]  And so, Homan says Trump says they're going after him.
[01:38:37.989 --> 01:38:38.489]  Well, that's good.
[01:38:39.869 --> 01:38:41.229]  And man, I'll be honest with you.
[01:38:41.630 --> 01:38:43.010]  He's open to shut convicted.
[01:38:43.649 --> 01:38:45.109]  I mean, it's a public crime.
[01:38:45.250 --> 01:38:46.029]  He's committed these crimes.
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:53.579]  So I would really like to see Mayorkas prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:39:05.600]  And Trump wants to pass a law that anybody that is sex trafficking children gets capital punishment.
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:13.069]  But nobody needs to harm a head, a hair on the head, Of any of these globalists.
[01:39:13.210 --> 01:39:14.250]  That would make them victims.
[01:39:14.449 --> 01:39:19.350]  You know, we want them prosecuted and given fair trials where all of it's opened up to the public.
[01:39:20.329 --> 01:39:23.829]  And then, whatever the jury gives them.
[01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:42.710]  And I'm sure once this all starts coming out, the people are going to want these pedophile ringleaders Hung.
[01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:45.390]  I think that's the way to do it.
[01:39:46.050 --> 01:39:48.270]  Yeah, start hanging them on national television.
[01:39:55.850 --> 01:39:57.869]  So that's where this needs to go.
[01:39:58.430 --> 01:40:02.170]  But don't you harm a hair on their chinny chin chin.
[01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:09.310]  Their house of cards is already coming down.
[01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:11.689]  We're gonna get them.
[01:40:16.659 --> 01:40:18.000]  But you take the government over.
[01:40:19.659 --> 01:40:21.119]  And you don't act like the left.
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:22.800]  Don't do this stuff, it's secret.
[01:40:22.899 --> 01:40:26.699]  But they had to do it in secret and rigged stuff because none of the patriots were guilty of anything.
[01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:37.060]  They spent four years, this is Congress, trying to find some Trump supporter that was prominent or official that would sell out to Russia.
[01:40:37.220 --> 01:40:38.199]  Russia wasn't doing it.
[01:40:38.239 --> 01:40:40.300]  It was the FBI and the CIA. That's all come out.
[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:41.239]  Sex operatives, you name it.
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:54.829]  They couldn't even get hot 30-year-old sex operatives Some of the Republicans had sex with the operatives, but when it got down to, hey, I work with the Russians, I want to give you a million dollars, they're like, bull crap.
[01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:57.010]  And it came out, they'd go report them to the government.
[01:40:57.890 --> 01:41:01.270]  So the Republicans did go to hotel rooms and have sex with these women.
[01:41:03.789 --> 01:41:05.390]  But none of them took the money.
[01:41:07.369 --> 01:41:09.529]  And I had them put sex operatives on me.
[01:41:10.369 --> 01:41:11.550]  They've done it in front of the crew.
[01:41:12.109 --> 01:41:13.050]  I've laughed at them.
[01:41:14.630 --> 01:41:16.590]  I said, what do you got, a sociology degree?
[01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:18.630]  Would you go to Georgetown or something?
[01:41:19.069 --> 01:41:21.029]  Oh, you work for the CIA, huh?
[01:41:21.109 --> 01:41:24.010]  You're actually in the agency, right?
[01:41:24.069 --> 01:41:24.869]  The women start shaking.
[01:41:25.010 --> 01:41:27.510]  Oh, you want to go to the hotel room right now, right?
[01:41:27.689 --> 01:41:29.590]  Hey guys, look at these CIA ladies.
[01:41:29.670 --> 01:41:30.670]  They think they're so smart.
[01:41:31.529 --> 01:41:32.789]  We think I'm a dumbass?
[01:41:35.970 --> 01:41:37.989]  What, you want to Julian Assange me, sweetheart?
[01:41:38.810 --> 01:41:43.210]  Quite frankly, I wouldn't say you're ugly, but you know, you'd be Marilyn Monroe, honey.
[01:41:44.899 --> 01:41:45.680]  Plus, I'm married.
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:49.720]  Why don't you take your ugly asses and get out of here?
[01:41:52.699 --> 01:41:59.239]  And man, when you start telling them where they went to school and Where they, what degrees they got, because you can just tell.
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:01.720]  I can see military people and say, you're in the Marines, right?
[01:42:01.779 --> 01:42:02.359]  Even without the tattoos.
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:03.920]  So you're in the Army, regular Army.
[01:42:04.399 --> 01:42:05.500]  You're in special operations.
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:06.119]  You just tell.
[01:42:06.239 --> 01:42:07.340]  All the groups have their own things.
[01:42:07.479 --> 01:42:09.119]  I know what pedophiles look like.
[01:42:09.439 --> 01:42:11.760]  I know what globalist sex operatives look like.
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:14.600]  I've had the Russians put sex operatives on me at least three times.
[01:42:15.039 --> 01:42:18.699]  And boy, the Russians, it's as naked and ham-fisted as it gets.
[01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:21.550]  Putin like you.
[01:42:22.630 --> 01:42:24.090]  They haven't done it in like 15 years.
[01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:28.329]  But I'll be at some 9-11 event or some speaking event like, oh, Mr. Jones.
[01:42:28.449 --> 01:42:31.130]  Be like a handler guy, usually about 65, you know, some Russian agent.
[01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:32.630]  She likes you.
[01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:33.670]  Be some beautiful blonde.
[01:42:34.090 --> 01:42:35.770]  Oh, she would like to go to dinner with you.
[01:42:35.850 --> 01:42:37.289]  Oh, wait, you're not like woman?
[01:42:37.449 --> 01:42:38.310]  How about money?
[01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.869]  Stocks?
[01:42:38.949 --> 01:42:39.729]  You come to Miami.
[01:42:40.069 --> 01:42:40.869]  Putin like you.
[01:42:42.489 --> 01:42:43.630]  You say, well, how do you know those weren't?
[01:42:43.890 --> 01:42:44.329]  No, no, no.
[01:42:44.430 --> 01:42:46.369]  When the FBI does it, it's done differently.
[01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:52.890]  But And I've had British MI6 try to put sex operatives on me.
[01:42:53.789 --> 01:42:59.710]  And the reason I tell you these stories, folks, is this has all come out.
[01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:06.909]  I told you about it years ago, but what, a month ago came out the sex operatives of the FBI. Yeah, the FBI is doing spy work with sex operatives.
[01:43:09.069 --> 01:43:20.729]  And I'm so proud of Trump supporters that they could not get anyone to To take money.
[01:43:24.250 --> 01:43:24.829]  No one.
[01:43:26.529 --> 01:43:27.090]  No one.
[01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.869]  That's us.
[01:43:30.289 --> 01:43:31.710]  Now, there's new photos came out.
[01:43:31.789 --> 01:43:32.810]  Nick Sordor posted them.
[01:43:32.930 --> 01:43:33.630]  I sent them to the Caribbean.
[01:43:33.789 --> 01:43:34.289]  You can pull them up real quick.
[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:37.460]  But we already had the meetings.
[01:43:37.579 --> 01:43:38.119]  We already had the minutes.
[01:43:38.239 --> 01:43:40.060]  We already had the documents that Biden famously said.
[01:43:40.119 --> 01:43:41.819]  I never knew who Hunter was talking to.
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:42.960]  I had nothing to do with him in business.
[01:43:43.239 --> 01:43:45.340]  I never met with Burisma or the Ukrainians.
[01:43:45.399 --> 01:43:47.979]  I never met with the Chinese officials.
[01:43:47.979 --> 01:43:54.100]  And then all the photos have now come out of Hunter with him and his dad at meetings with the Chinese communist leaders.
[01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:56.340]  But we already know all that.
[01:43:56.439 --> 01:44:00.880]  We have Hunter Biden's laptop where he's talking about the head of Chinese intelligence managing him and his dad.
[01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:09.130]  Yeah, that's it with them with Burisma.
[01:44:09.869 --> 01:44:12.369]  Go to Nick Sordor's ex.
[01:44:12.909 --> 01:44:13.850]  I sent him this morning.
[01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:17.170]  I got it here on the stack, but for some reason I can't find it.
[01:44:17.869 --> 01:44:18.569]  Here, I'll just show you.
[01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:21.670]  Just type in Nick Sordor.
[01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:22.170]  You go there.
[01:44:23.829 --> 01:44:24.569]  There it is.
[01:44:25.810 --> 01:44:30.649]  Remember the famous videos of Clinton that got released via lawsuits?
[01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:42.329]  Meeting in the White House and the Chinese Communist generals in suits are giving him giant Briefcases, the big giant square ones, full of $100 bills.
[01:44:44.010 --> 01:44:45.989]  Come on in here with that, guys.
[01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.810]  That's right.
[01:44:46.930 --> 01:44:48.329]  I'll take it in $100 bills.
[01:44:50.529 --> 01:44:58.409]  So, 100 years of jail, no parole, U.S. court sentences, gay couple for horrific sexual abuse of adopted sons.
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:08.239]  Gay couple, you mean pedophile couple, who showed off picture-perfect family gets 100 years in prison for horrific rape of adopted sons.
[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:15.979]  Husband, not a husband, who abused adopted sons in house of horror slapped with massive prison sentences.
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:19.560]  Gay couple faces 100 years in prison for sexually abusing adopted sons.
[01:45:20.199 --> 01:45:22.920]  Viral gay couple sentenced to rape of adopted sons.
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:24.979]  Oh yeah.
[01:45:25.739 --> 01:45:27.140]  Here's some photos of them.
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:29.659]  With their sex slaves.
[01:45:30.699 --> 01:45:32.579]  And it just comes out all the time.
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:37.479]  Got to do something about these missing children grabbed by the perverts.
[01:45:37.819 --> 01:45:39.619]  Too many incidents, fast trial, death penalty.
[01:45:39.739 --> 01:45:40.119]  That's Trump.
[01:45:40.399 --> 01:45:43.880]  Who, by the way, first exposed every Epstein.
[01:45:45.239 --> 01:45:46.460]  And then we've got this video.
[01:45:46.619 --> 01:45:47.180]  Let's play this.
[01:45:48.699 --> 01:45:51.159]  Remember when Alex Jones accused the CIA of human trafficking?
[01:45:51.359 --> 01:45:54.239]  A CIA contractor who recently caught trafficking children through an airport.
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:56.939]  We'll get to that coming up, then our guest is going to join us.
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:02.800]  Please remember, you are the reason we're here.

[01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:15.319]  And now, our great sponsor has launched the Alex Jones Store affiliate program.

[01:46:31.359 --> 01:46:34.760]  So for all the patriots, via email and text message and...
[01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:38.710]  X, particularly in Instagram and YouTube, everywhere.

[01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:51.630]  Check out this new, you know, collectible knife or these collectible posters.

[01:46:59.029 --> 01:47:03.670]  And you're promoting the t-shirt, you're promoting the supplement, promoting the campaign coins.

[01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:14.520]  Paid right into your bank account.

[01:47:31.569 --> 01:47:32.670]  There's five posters.
[01:47:32.770 --> 01:47:33.609]  I designed four of them.
[01:47:33.909 --> 01:47:34.670]  They're excellent.
[01:47:35.050 --> 01:47:36.770]  They're between $15 and $29.
[01:47:37.329 --> 01:47:39.909]  There's good markup in those so that we actually get some funds in.
[01:47:39.989 --> 01:47:43.789]  Everything else doesn't have that much markup, especially with the affiliate program taking 10% off the top.
[01:47:44.010 --> 01:47:48.689]  Some of the stuff on sale is a loss leader with that deal, but we know you'll love the product, so we're doing it.
[01:47:49.279 --> 01:47:50.260]  Our sponsors are smart.
[01:47:50.399 --> 01:47:51.539]  I'll have to make the decisions on that.
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:52.340]  I decide the products.
[01:47:53.319 --> 01:47:55.779]  But it is insane, the affiliate deal.
[01:47:56.779 --> 01:47:59.500]  Everyone, and even if you're not super technical, it's simple.
[01:47:59.619 --> 01:48:00.680]  You go sign up for free.
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:14.460]  It gives you your link, your tag, and you can spend a few more minutes on there and you can even generate a link to yours that says thealexjonesstore.com and then the URL or handle that you put at the end of it.
[01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:17.029]  There's so much more with this system.
[01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:18.270]  It's the best, newest software.
[01:48:18.449 --> 01:48:18.890]  It works great.

[01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:40.329]  We are reaching tens of millions of new people a day.
[01:48:40.850 --> 01:48:44.289]  We are one of the most devastating operations of the globalists, thanks to your support.
[01:48:46.350 --> 01:48:47.189]  We need to stay on air.

[01:49:11.579 --> 01:49:13.159]  Do your Christmas shopping with us.
[01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:16.619]  But some amazing new products just came in.
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:19.520]  And when I say amazing, I'm excited.
[01:49:19.739 --> 01:49:21.640]  I know these are going to go quickly.
[01:49:23.039 --> 01:49:23.560]  Unfortunately...
[01:49:24.729 --> 01:49:28.569]  This will solve all our problems, but they only made $2,000 in this limited edition.
[01:49:29.050 --> 01:49:34.670]  But it'll go a long way towards our lawsuits and funding our operations and the new network and everything else and keeping InfoWars on it.
[01:49:34.810 --> 01:49:35.489]  That continues.
[01:49:35.689 --> 01:49:36.489]  Look at this bad boy.
[01:49:36.609 --> 01:49:39.350]  The 1984 versus 1776 coin.
[01:49:39.529 --> 01:49:40.149]  I designed it.
[01:49:40.289 --> 01:49:46.590]  There's only 2,000 of these bad boys at TheAlexJonesStore.com and they are a fundraiser.
[01:49:46.670 --> 01:49:48.069]  They are a piece of history.
[01:49:48.289 --> 01:49:50.069]  They're pure silver.
[01:49:50.489 --> 01:49:52.829]  They are minted here in America.
[01:49:54.140 --> 01:49:55.319]  2,000 of these.
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:57.760]  I predict these sell out in just a couple days.
[01:49:58.119 --> 01:50:02.159]  This is a great Christmas gift, a memento that you stood for the Republic at a critical time.
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:03.399]  They are incredible.
[01:50:03.699 --> 01:50:10.180]  Get the 1984 versus 1776 coin at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:18.329]  And the store's not owned by me, so even if the globalists come after us, Even if they take over Infowars next week, they're not going to shut down the AlexShieldsStore.com.
[01:50:18.329 --> 01:50:21.630]  That is our main sponsor with the AlexShields Network and everything we're doing going into the future.
[01:50:21.789 --> 01:50:24.569]  So get this amazing coin now.
[01:50:24.770 --> 01:50:33.050]  And if you don't want to, don't have the money to get that because it's marked up for a fundraiser, a memento, a limited edition, we have challenge coins, a whole bunch of them.
[01:50:33.319 --> 01:50:38.600]  Between 995 and 1495, when tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:40.359]  And on the other side, it's got the Gadsden flag.
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:41.220]  Don't tread on me.
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:43.539]  1776, another one with Alex Jones.
[01:50:43.659 --> 01:50:44.319]  You're truly on it.
[01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:47.380]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 with the Gadsden flag.
[01:50:47.659 --> 01:50:49.899]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God on the other side.
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:54.899]  And there's some other great challenge coins as well at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:50:55.119 --> 01:50:57.260]  Now, this is even more exciting.
[01:50:57.479 --> 01:50:58.520]  They surprised me with this.
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:50:59.600]  I just learned this morning.
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:06.319]  So it's in the mail from Arkansas where their factory is and Their shipping department and all that, the big lead that owns and runs the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:51:06.539 --> 01:51:11.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump on a Stomp, 1995. Everybody loves Elf on a Shelf.
[01:51:11.619 --> 01:51:14.520]  This is Trump on a Stomp Christmas figurine.
[01:51:14.659 --> 01:51:16.579]  Oh, my daughter loves Elf on a Shelf.
[01:51:16.739 --> 01:51:18.359]  We play with them, do all sorts of stuff.
[01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:21.399]  Catapult them around the house, play with the cats, play with them.
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:23.680]  We've probably got 15 of those Elf on a Shelf.
[01:51:23.739 --> 01:51:25.140]  Book a little elf village in the backyard.
[01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:25.979]  We have a lot of fun.
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:27.800]  She puts Christmas tree lights in these little...
[01:51:28.630 --> 01:51:29.930]  Little trees we got in the backyard.
[01:51:30.270 --> 01:51:32.850]  Oh my gosh, I've got to have this, and I already called them.
[01:51:32.970 --> 01:51:35.729]  I said, I want 10 set aside for me, so that means theirs.
[01:51:37.469 --> 01:51:39.369]  1,900 and something of these.
[01:51:39.529 --> 01:51:42.069]  And I'm telling you, this is going to sell out today.
[01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:44.470]  Why they didn't get 20,000 of them, I don't know.
[01:51:44.609 --> 01:51:45.750]  All my problems would be solved.
[01:51:45.890 --> 01:51:46.970]  We would have plenty of fun.
[01:51:47.109 --> 01:51:48.710]  This baby is amazing.
[01:51:48.890 --> 01:51:54.069]  Everybody needs to have this original Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:57.970]  Celebrate Christmas with the Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[01:51:58.130 --> 01:52:01.250]  The ultimate conversation starter for your tree or mantle.
[01:52:01.550 --> 01:52:01.930]  Fully published.
[01:52:01.949 --> 01:52:09.409]  Poseable and ready to take on the globalist, this festive figure can be positioned in any stance from bold and defiant to perfectly perched.
[01:52:09.550 --> 01:52:17.569]  Whether you're decking the halls or making a statement, this patriotic decoration will keep the spirit of 1776 alive all season long, right into Trump being inaugurated next month.
[01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:19.350]  Get your Trump on a stump now!
[01:52:19.649 --> 01:52:27.609]  Ultimate CMOS, Patriot gear, amazing hoodies, Christmas sweaters and more, and fund the second American Revolution worldwide at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:52:36.829 --> 01:52:43.770]  We do not live in a direct democracy, meaning that we do not simply elect the chancellor by ourselves.
[01:52:44.289 --> 01:53:04.369]  And all the other establishment parties have already sworn to build the big coalition, the firewall against the right, die Brandmauer, a metaphorical term that we use to describe it when all the other parties decide to unite against The right,
[01:53:04.649 --> 01:53:05.989]  which is the AfD.
[01:53:21.029 --> 01:53:30.970]  But let's envision this absolutely delusional and anti-democratic future where the AfD, even though it's the most popular party, cannot be in the ruling government.
[01:53:31.789 --> 01:53:39.109]  It would be so outrageous and so obviously tyrannical that the people would revolt.
[01:53:39.590 --> 01:53:42.350]  And perhaps that will be the case.
[01:53:42.710 --> 01:53:56.010]  And so the other parties should be very, very careful and consider whether or not they actually want to undermine not just the AFD, but the voice of the people.
[01:53:56.369 --> 01:54:13.989]  Because I seriously suspect That if the CDU claims to be the ruling party and form a coalition with all the other parties, they will be so unpopular that the government will collapse within a couple of months.
[01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:21.510]  Because if they unite with the Green Party and the far left once again, there will be no change.
[01:54:21.970 --> 01:54:25.270]  And change is what the people are voting for this year.
[01:54:25.810 --> 01:54:30.670]  They want to change after the previous government collapsed.
[01:54:30.989 --> 01:54:44.890]  But if this previous government is once again embedded in the same government, then how can you vote for change unless you are brave and you make the decision?
[01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:57.199]  To vote for the AFD. Germany, you have an incredible opportunity now to show those establishment parties that you are in charge of the change you want to see in Germany.
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:05.279]  Vote accordingly and make sure that you do not only become the media on X, but you become Germany.
[01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:10.920]  Don't let Germany be in the hands of a tyrannical government anymore.
[01:55:11.319 --> 01:55:17.350]  The AFD is the only party that will make sure That your voice will be heard.
[01:55:17.850 --> 01:55:20.569]  Only the AFD can save Germany.
[01:55:22.569 --> 01:55:28.189]  Remember the clip of Elon Musk the day before the election on Joe Rogan?
[01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:29.109]  We'll get it for the next segment.
[01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:32.170]  And he says, listen, this is an existential threat.
[01:55:32.489 --> 01:55:35.250]  Vote for Trump like your future depends on it because it does.
[01:55:35.850 --> 01:55:48.989]  And last week, Elon Musk retweeted Naomi Zyp's latest comments, he does it all the time, and the entire German media, the US media, the world media freaked out.
[01:55:49.050 --> 01:55:52.289]  Oh my God, they're meddling, and who listens to this woman?
[01:55:52.409 --> 01:55:53.930]  Hundreds of millions are watching her.
[01:55:54.189 --> 01:55:55.390]  We can't have that.
[01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:56.449]  No one listens to us.
[01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:57.510]  You saw Congress people.
[01:55:57.750 --> 01:56:01.569]  Musk just shot down our big spending bill that had medical tyranny in it.
[01:56:02.210 --> 01:56:04.670]  Lockdowns, forced injections, quarantining, all of it.
[01:56:06.670 --> 01:56:09.109]  We can't have the people influencing Congress.
[01:56:10.350 --> 01:56:12.229]  We can't have Elon Musk doing that.
[01:56:12.329 --> 01:56:13.029]  This is outrageous.
[01:56:13.229 --> 01:56:18.529]  And of course, poll numbers just came out since last week and it's made AFD even more popular.
[01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:22.350]  The world is in the middle of a giant awakening.
[01:56:24.289 --> 01:56:27.470]  The globalists are in desperate straits.
[01:56:28.439 --> 01:56:30.720]  We have Naomi connected.
[01:56:31.279 --> 01:56:35.439]  We're going to come back and talk to her on the other side.
[01:56:35.539 --> 01:56:36.819]  And we're going to be getting her in studio soon.
[01:56:36.819 --> 01:56:40.420]  She's here visiting the United States right now.
[01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:44.340]  But Germany's fight is our fight.
[01:56:44.399 --> 01:56:45.319]  Our fight is their fight.
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:49.619]  We are facing a globalist threat, a world tyrannical system.
[01:56:51.970 --> 01:56:55.029]  People in Germany really need to use X to know what's really happening.
[01:56:55.149 --> 01:56:56.609]  The legacy media is pure propaganda.
[01:56:57.449 --> 01:56:59.289]  Send X links to friends in Europe.
[01:56:59.489 --> 01:57:01.710]  That's Elon Musk talking about Naomi Zeip.
[01:57:01.829 --> 01:57:03.250]  We'll talk to her straight ahead.
[01:57:03.489 --> 01:57:06.210]  On the other side, please share the live link right now from Real Alex Jones.
[01:57:06.329 --> 01:57:07.010]  That's how we win.
[01:57:07.210 --> 01:57:12.069]  We are now into our number three on this Christmas Eve, December 24th.
[01:57:15.370 --> 01:57:28.329]  We're good to go.
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:49.039]  We're good to go.
[01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:55.619]  Welcome to X today and to band out video.
[01:57:55.819 --> 01:58:00.340]  We'll add some of the clips we played last week where they're just, this woman, they're listening to her.
[01:58:00.399 --> 01:58:01.100]  Who is she?
[01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:09.640]  And Elon, he's not allowed to say he doesn't like us giving a woman a longer prison sentence than the man that raped her because she criticized him because he's a migrant.
[01:58:10.439 --> 01:58:15.260]  Or, oh, you can't say it's an illegal alien that ran over all these people at the Christmas event last week.
[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:18.119]  No, you're not supposed to say that.
[01:58:18.119 --> 01:58:21.779]  Or you can't say it's an illegal alien that torched this lady on the New York subway.
[01:58:23.010 --> 01:58:27.789]  So they sit there and literally go, Elon Musk is influencing Congress and so on the American people.
[01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:28.829]  We can't allow that.
[01:58:29.289 --> 01:58:31.409]  They are just apoplectic.
[01:58:32.130 --> 01:58:35.890]  So here's some of the headlines right here.
[01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:39.949]  J.D. Vance appears to defend Germany's far-right AFD party.
[01:58:40.770 --> 01:58:44.090]  And the corporate media is just like, oh my God, he's appearing to.
[01:58:44.250 --> 01:58:47.529]  Like, we caught him trying to control the narrative.
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:52.380]  Mandenberg, a tax suspect, said Elon Musk and Alex Jones telling the truth.
[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:53.539]  Oh, he's a big leptist.
[01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:55.979]  The BBC promoted him trafficking women in there.
[01:58:56.039 --> 01:58:58.399]  So they're trying to divert off into all of that.
[01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:01.420]  How dare the AFD nationalist party that's surging to the lead?
[01:59:01.579 --> 01:59:04.060]  How dare them protest the illegals killing people?
[01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:05.180]  And that's what they've always been doing.
[01:59:06.020 --> 01:59:08.060]  Oh, they're the bad people for seizing on this.
[01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:13.140]  No, the bad people are the people bringing in all these illegals all over Europe and here to just wreak havoc.
[01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:16.640]  So, Naomi Zeip joins us.
[01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:22.340]  And you can find her on X. We've got it up on screen for you here in a moment.
[01:59:22.619 --> 01:59:24.520]  Naomi, big fan of what you're doing.
[01:59:24.659 --> 01:59:26.479]  We really appreciate you supporting InfoWars.
[01:59:26.619 --> 01:59:28.899]  We've seen your work as well during all this.
[01:59:28.979 --> 01:59:29.800]  You've been dead on.
[01:59:29.939 --> 01:59:34.420]  We've only got a little while with you here, and I appreciate your time.
[01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:36.539]  But I could ask a lot of questions, but wow.
[01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:39.420]  I mean, I see what's happening in Germany so important.
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:41.460]  The EU, as you know, is unelected, tyrannical.
[01:59:41.800 --> 01:59:46.000]  Maybe for folks that don't know about that and the commission, I need to understand that.
[01:59:46.119 --> 01:59:47.340]  I mean, you can start wherever you want.
[01:59:47.460 --> 01:59:53.460]  Elon Musk championing what Germany's doing fighting this tyranny, you know, championing what you're doing.
[01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:57.640]  The EU's been coming after him and X trying to shut down our free speech here in America.
[01:59:57.680 --> 02:00:01.479]  So we should have Americans speaking out and saying we don't like what's happening in Germany.
[02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:08.470]  Germans have a right, you know, with Biden trying to start World War III to criticize what he's We all have rights.
[02:00:08.689 --> 02:00:10.130]  We're all a very small planet here.
[02:00:10.210 --> 02:00:18.989]  I don't think this is election meddling at all for us to point out the tyranny of the unelected EU system and your communist bureaucrats there in Berlin.
[02:00:19.329 --> 02:00:21.350]  So thank you so much, Naomi, for joining us.
[02:00:22.479 --> 02:00:24.039]  Thank you so much for having me on the show.
[02:00:24.199 --> 02:00:28.279]  First of all, I have to say I've been a huge fan of yours since the very beginning.
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:29.579]  I'm not lying about this.
[02:00:29.699 --> 02:00:41.279]  You were one of the very first people who pulled me back in, I think, 2016. So this is truly amazing for me and you have inspired the revolution in Germany as well.
[02:00:42.359 --> 02:00:44.680]  It's been crazy over the past months.
[02:00:44.979 --> 02:01:00.520]  I have just become more vocal about German politics internationally and at first it seriously was a struggle because interestingly in Germany I got a lot of backlash for branching out and Producing more international content,
[02:01:00.779 --> 02:01:14.439]  even though I had already been in the international media around 2020. But this year I really invested all my efforts in speaking up for free speech in Europe and Germany in particular on X mostly.
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:19.680]  And it apparently caused a lot of...
[02:01:19.989 --> 02:01:31.069]  Yeah, I think.
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:02:01.720]  With these mainstream channels in Germany, therefore, and also in connection with our German guild, as you know, it's been very problematic to inspire people to be brave and And look into the side that is denounced and demonized as the alleged Nazi side.
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:09.159]  But now the lies are becoming so obvious in the mainstream media that more and more people are just so fed up with the establishment.
[02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:12.399]  And at this point, there are only two...
[02:02:13.029 --> 02:02:14.250]  Ways that you can vote.
[02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:25.189]  You can either vote for the AFD, which will mean change, and finally abolishing everything that has been destroying your lives in Germany for the past, I would say, over nine years.
[02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:32.390]  It started really badly when Merkel came into office because she formed a coalition with the Green Party.
[02:02:32.569 --> 02:02:36.489]  And the Green Party are the far-left Marxist extremists.
[02:02:36.569 --> 02:02:40.170]  They also have a lot of, famously, a lot of pedophiles in their party.
[02:02:40.869 --> 02:02:45.670]  And now it's just we are in a far-left liberal cesspool.
[02:02:45.970 --> 02:03:01.229]  So then afterwards, after Merkel, we got a far-left coalition, like openly far-left coalition, and that is about to be replaced by, well, either the CDU, which is the Merkel party again, or the AFD. There's only these two options, basically.
[02:03:01.569 --> 02:03:13.020]  The support is very high right now for the CDU. However, the problem is that the most popular party at this point is the AFD. So how is that going to play out?
[02:03:13.420 --> 02:03:17.800]  How are they not going to win if they are the most popular party?
[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:18.899]  Well, that's the problem.
[02:03:19.279 --> 02:03:34.239]  The other establishment parties, they actually despise democracy because they want to form a big coalition, the so-called firewall, the Brandmauer, against the AFD to basically overrule the AFD even if they become the most popular party.
[02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:40.029]  And yeah, basically go against the democratic voices of the people.
[02:03:40.210 --> 02:03:45.789]  They refuse to form a coalition with the right because they demonize them so much.
[02:03:45.989 --> 02:03:54.149]  And what that means in the long term is that you get the same government, the same far-left government that just collapsed in Germany.
[02:03:54.430 --> 02:04:03.569]  So make your decision and vote in accordance with your actual virtues and not with the lies that are being spread on the mainstream media.
[02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:07.869]  I totally agree with you.
[02:04:08.649 --> 02:04:13.350]  I mean, again, some Americans will say, why do we care about Germany?
[02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:14.909]  It's such a tiny planet.
[02:04:15.090 --> 02:04:19.449]  We're all facing the WF, UN, BlackRock, global government.
[02:04:19.609 --> 02:04:27.609]  They have global government symposiums saying they're going to take full control of our lives, cashless societies, forced injections, UN treaties.
[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:29.920]  That is insane.
[02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:36.039]  If we want to be sovereign and independent, we have to be engaged and involved and realized we face a global enemy.
[02:04:36.359 --> 02:04:47.899]  And for those that don't know, Germany is holding up the tyrannical EU. The Germans are paying for the majority of it, just like Americans pay for the majority of NATO. And it's absolutely outrageous.
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:57.840]  And then you've got the demonization of AFD. You've got them trying to outlaw AFD. And if you study the platform and the leadership, they're not even as hardcore as Donald Trump, who's not even right-wing.
[02:04:57.939 --> 02:04:58.899]  He's just populist.
[02:04:59.359 --> 02:05:04.960]  And the AFD is just a good old-fashioned, decent...
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:14.840]  We're good to go.
[02:05:17.609 --> 02:05:23.630]  Yeah, you are absolutely right about the fact that this is a matter of international importance.
[02:05:23.869 --> 02:05:25.229]  It's not just about Germany.
[02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:43.140]  This is a globalist war that we are fighting, which is why I started speaking up for free speech in the first place because, well, I became aware of channels like yours and I understood very quickly that whatever's going on, My free speech being restricted in Germany, that doesn't just have to do with this German guilt complex.
[02:05:43.439 --> 02:05:54.100]  There's something way bigger going on, and these migration flows, mass influx of immigrants in Germany, that's not just a uniquely European problem.
[02:05:54.119 --> 02:06:02.579]  You were facing exactly the same problems in your previous election, which is why I came to America to observe these elections, because I could tell there is hope.
[02:06:03.029 --> 02:06:07.550]  If Trump gets into office, there's hope for the entire West, in fact.
[02:06:08.090 --> 02:06:18.090]  And so Donald Trump's victory has inspired countless people, even in Germany, to look behind the lies of the mainstream media.
[02:06:18.210 --> 02:06:26.250]  Because until the very end, even days before the election in America, when it was basically clear for everyone in America that Trump was going to win...
[02:06:26.899 --> 02:06:32.960]  German media still spread the lie that it was looking like Kamala Harris was going to get into office.
[02:06:33.579 --> 02:06:38.460]  And over 70% of Germans still believed that Kamala Harris was going to win.
[02:06:38.819 --> 02:06:45.319]  Not that they supported her, simply that based on what they got from the mainstream media, they thought she was genuinely going to win.
[02:06:45.899 --> 02:06:52.399]  And then after Donald Trump's victory, suddenly they realized, wait a minute, what else have we been lied to?
[02:06:52.659 --> 02:06:55.500]  That's why this had such an international impact.
[02:06:55.500 --> 02:07:00.279]  And this is also why German politics matters to America, in my opinion.
[02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:05.600]  I think we should form better relations between Germany and America.
[02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:11.319]  We would have the chance to achieve so much greatness in Germany.
[02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:13.020]  In collaboration with each other.
[02:07:13.220 --> 02:07:16.079]  Because we are patriots on both sides.
[02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:19.520]  That doesn't mean that we are nationalist extremists.
[02:07:19.699 --> 02:07:25.460]  It simply means that we are proud of what we can achieve by ourselves and our own nations.
[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:31.479]  But we also like to collaborate with each other and then fight the same tyranny.
[02:07:33.949 --> 02:07:35.890]  Wow, you're absolutely right.
[02:07:36.109 --> 02:07:52.649]  Look, now that the tide has globally turned, and the Great Awakening is here, even the bad guys admit that, their attempts to then ridicule Elon Musk or J.D. Vance, or blame Elon or myself, which, as you know, the international press, the German press has been doing for this nutball,
[02:07:52.869 --> 02:08:06.310]  who was on the BBC, them promoting him, smuggling women illegally into Europe, the psychiatrist, this super creep, And then he does pop into some interview and say one nice thing about me and Elon Musk.
[02:08:06.770 --> 02:08:08.350]  It almost seems like a setup.
[02:08:08.510 --> 02:08:10.149]  I'm not saying he's an operative.
[02:08:10.489 --> 02:08:12.149]  I'm not saying he's MKUltra.
[02:08:12.250 --> 02:08:13.810]  But it is.
[02:08:14.250 --> 02:08:19.329]  The BBC is doing big promotions on him, saying he's great, helping his human trafficking operation.
[02:08:19.789 --> 02:08:23.270]  They're refusing to extradite him for a bunch of reported crimes in Saudi Arabia.
[02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:25.930]  And then he goes and does this.
[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:38.560]  And it's exactly what AFD's been warning about with all these other Christmas attacks with cars in Germany and France, the freedom barriers they put up, the Orwellian term, and then magically he supports Alex Jones and Elon Musk.
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:41.859]  I mean, I've seen this movie before.
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:43.340]  What are you thinking about that?
[02:08:45.069 --> 02:08:53.649]  They are putting a target on my back as well, because apparently he followed me too, and the media say that he was a fan of mine.
[02:08:54.210 --> 02:08:55.449]  I don't buy it.
[02:08:59.090 --> 02:09:10.409]  He did speak a lot of German on X as well, and he communicated with a couple of my friends and colleagues in the German sphere who are Islam critics.
[02:09:11.189 --> 02:09:11.810]  Some of them.
[02:09:12.170 --> 02:09:25.270]  And he was trying to get into their circle and do some kind of appeasement politics with them and get into their activism and spread the word with them.
[02:09:25.369 --> 02:09:26.529]  But he was always...
[02:09:28.419 --> 02:09:29.880]  Ridiculously extremist, apparently.
[02:09:30.140 --> 02:09:38.640]  So I saw a bunch of posts that he had made and I was informed by a couple of friends what kinds of messages that he had sent them.
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:41.500]  And it just sounds very staged.
[02:09:41.619 --> 02:09:42.420]  It sounds very fake.
[02:09:42.579 --> 02:09:44.319]  I mean, maybe he's just crazy.
[02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:45.420]  Maybe he's just insane.
[02:09:45.739 --> 02:09:52.199]  But these friends of mine told me we already suspected prior to the attack that Something was very wrong with him.
[02:09:52.300 --> 02:10:01.439]  And we did not believe that he was actually an Islam critic, that he was actually trying to be part of the club.
[02:10:01.659 --> 02:10:06.140]  It was, yeah, what many may refer to as bedposting.
[02:10:06.300 --> 02:10:08.060]  I don't know if it was a setup.
[02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:09.699]  Maybe he was just insane.
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.560]  But the entire story is simply not adding up.
[02:10:12.659 --> 02:10:17.760]  And I feel like they are trying to put a target on our back on purpose.
[02:10:18.140 --> 02:10:19.680]  And for me...
[02:10:19.699 --> 02:10:23.939]  Obviously, since I am from Germany, this is particularly concerning.
[02:10:24.380 --> 02:10:31.560]  I was supposed to be in Germany now and possibly spend Christmas there with some friends and family.
[02:10:31.779 --> 02:10:38.300]  That's not happening because it's too dangerous for me, especially my hometown.
[02:10:39.180 --> 02:10:42.340]  They published an article just today about...
[02:10:43.699 --> 02:10:54.739]  How curious it is that I am always on the front lines being mentioned in the media, not just around Elon Musk, but now also around the Magdeburg attacker.
[02:10:55.119 --> 02:11:04.689]  And you have to know that in my town, that is Münster, probably not very well known to many people, but Antifa is very strong over there.
[02:11:04.890 --> 02:11:17.390]  I've had some confrontations with Antifa in the past, but at this point with the media backlash, I think it could seriously be dangerous for me to run into some crazy people from Antifa over there.
[02:11:19.710 --> 02:11:23.750]  Antifa has been stabbing and bombing all over Germany.
[02:11:23.909 --> 02:11:26.510]  They've been physically attacking people and in Spain, you name it.
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:43.680]  Yeah, so I don't know if all this was on purpose, but what is on purpose is definitely trying to mess me and people like you into this attack, which is its diabolical inversion of the truth.
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:47.680]  Because the truth is, this criminal from Saudi Arabia...
[02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:55.680]  He should have been extradited a long time ago and he was a known criminal even before he applied for asylum in Germany.
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:59.779]  And if the AFD had been in power, he wouldn't be in Germany.
[02:12:00.699 --> 02:12:02.979]  And then none of this would have happened.
[02:12:03.220 --> 02:12:04.600]  It's as simple as that.
[02:12:04.899 --> 02:12:07.420]  That would have been the way to prevent it.
[02:12:07.979 --> 02:12:20.479]  Not all these, there's an SPD politician and CDU politicians now claiming on social media it was Elon Musk's fault, for example, because he didn't monitor his tweets closely enough.
[02:12:21.239 --> 02:12:23.000]  Isn't that crazy?
[02:12:23.239 --> 02:12:24.119]  That's insane.
[02:12:24.300 --> 02:12:26.859]  That is true insanity or it's just evil.
[02:12:29.239 --> 02:12:30.659]  Well, it sure is.
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:37.960]  And let's play a clip of this Saudi Arabian psychiatrist illegally in Germany, protected by the German government.
[02:12:39.060 --> 02:12:41.500]  And then now we're being blamed for what he did.
[02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:44.380]  But you, myself, and Elon Musk were in quite the club here.
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:46.960]  And just how scared they are of you.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.079]  Because the people like citizen journalists.
[02:12:50.079 --> 02:12:51.800]  They like people that are telling the truth.
[02:12:52.260 --> 02:12:53.739]  And they're just apoplectic.
[02:12:53.739 --> 02:12:54.840]  I want to ask you about this clip.
[02:12:54.939 --> 02:12:56.319]  What do you think they're going to do next?
[02:12:58.199 --> 02:13:02.899]  Despite all these demonization tactics against AFD, they're only surging in the polls.
[02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:03.739]  Here's the clue.
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:25.680]  But from my own experience, I can tell you for 100% that everything Elon Musk says or Tommy Robinson or other people like, I think, Alex Jones or, you know, who are classified by the mainstream media as radicals on the far right,
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:29.100]  They are telling the truth.
[02:13:29.479 --> 02:13:31.579]  They are absolutely telling the truth.
[02:13:31.739 --> 02:13:33.680]  And I'm saying this as a leftist.
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:35.060]  I'm not on the right.
[02:13:35.319 --> 02:13:36.380]  I'm a leftist.
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:47.479]  And what I discovered as a leftist is that leftists are the worst criminals on this planet.
[02:13:48.079 --> 02:13:53.199]  They claim, they claim that they are true criminals.
[02:14:00.340 --> 02:14:05.479]  They claim what they do is exactly the opposite.
[02:14:06.100 --> 02:14:19.600]  Like, what happens to female Saudi ex-Muslims is definitely an evidence that leftists are the worst criminals on this planet.
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:21.239]  And I say this as a leftist.
[02:14:22.670 --> 02:14:34.649]  Do we know, Naomi, now, I mean, there he is on BBC International Television promoting his website for women to be smuggled in by him, and the government allowing that as well.
[02:14:36.109 --> 02:14:40.590]  Has he said why he picked a bunch of Germans at a Christmas party?
[02:14:40.949 --> 02:14:43.109]  Because that's what an Al-Qaeda person would do.
[02:14:43.210 --> 02:14:44.729]  Why did he do a classic Al-Qaeda thing?
[02:14:46.569 --> 02:14:47.409]  I have no idea.
[02:14:47.789 --> 02:14:50.890]  And I don't think we will find out from the media.
[02:14:51.170 --> 02:14:54.189]  They just want to blame us for this attack.
[02:14:54.609 --> 02:14:57.949]  And it's the wildest story.
[02:14:58.189 --> 02:14:59.909]  It just doesn't make sense.
[02:15:00.189 --> 02:15:06.829]  All that matters in the end is that he wouldn't have been there if the AFD had been in power.
[02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:13.210]  And clearly, they are terrified of the support that the AFD is currently getting.
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:17.159]  So close just before the upcoming election.
[02:15:17.439 --> 02:15:34.250]  The previous government just collapsed, the five left government under the SPD and the Green Party and FDP. Because the FDP, the only party that was Somewhat, like, slightly oppositional to the rest from the far left.
[02:15:34.850 --> 02:15:40.470]  They eventually stood up against the coalition and told them, well, this is going too far.
[02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:49.149]  We're spending way too much money on stuff that doesn't make sense, like the climate agenda, which I spoke up against as well for a long time and still do.
[02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:59.729]  And now for the upcoming election, it suddenly looks like Alice Weidel, the chancellor candidate for the AFD, is in fact the most popular candidate.
[02:15:59.989 --> 02:16:01.270]  So what are they going to do?
[02:16:01.409 --> 02:16:12.850]  They have to stage either some sort of false flag or they have to find a ridiculous way that they can twist the narrative until they can still blame it on us.
[02:16:13.010 --> 02:16:14.710]  They will always find a way.
[02:16:15.039 --> 02:16:21.039]  They can come up with any story, and they will still find a way to blame it on the AFD or on us.
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:25.859]  But the truth is, most people are done with it.
[02:16:26.279 --> 02:16:30.420]  And I can see how the narrative just keeps shifting.
[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:34.840]  Why do you think Alice Weidel just got more popular in the polls?
[02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:37.139]  Because the media is lying.
[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:42.079]  And because the people don't want to pay taxes for this bullshit anymore.
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:44.299]  It's way too much at this point.
[02:16:46.129 --> 02:16:53.549]  Yeah, for those that don't know, Germany pays, what, double what you should for your population to prop up the EU? Oh, yeah.
[02:16:54.069 --> 02:17:04.750]  We pay way too much for the entire EU. Ali Simon from the AFD has also announced we should seriously consider the DEXIT, so stepping out of the EU altogether.
[02:17:05.149 --> 02:17:22.969]  But the ideal solution, even in her mind, would be to have some sort of economic European Union, but completely disconnected from what we have right now, which is basically an EU super-state that just robs us of our sovereignty in our individual nations.
[02:17:23.229 --> 02:17:25.430]  And then we have no impact anymore.
[02:17:25.649 --> 02:17:30.729]  The goal of the EU is to stifle the support for the AFD in Germany.
[02:17:30.729 --> 02:17:32.229]  That is crystal clear.
[02:17:32.510 --> 02:17:43.129]  And even if the AFD gains even more support, I can predict that there's going to be some sort of EU mechanism that will try to mess with it.
[02:17:44.900 --> 02:17:48.219]  Completely disregarding their alleged democratic principles.
[02:17:48.459 --> 02:17:51.840]  They are always the ones accusing us of being anti-democratic.
[02:17:52.100 --> 02:17:56.340]  That's why they even wanted to ban the AFD for a very long time, and they still do.
[02:17:56.520 --> 02:18:01.899]  But, I mean, right now it's just completely obvious that that would fail disastrously.
[02:18:02.430 --> 02:18:03.389]  They are trying.
[02:18:05.829 --> 02:18:17.770]  They decided to actually initiate the process to eliminate the AFD. But that means that they have to have a public discussion about the AFD. And it will fail.
[02:18:18.829 --> 02:18:34.030]  So then there will at least be a discussion around why it has to fail, why they have to tolerate the AFD. And that means more attention, more positive attention for the AFD. So at this point, they're just shooting themselves in the foot.
[02:18:34.350 --> 02:18:34.829]  We are winning.
[02:18:36.709 --> 02:18:42.450]  Naomi, do a little bit more with us on the other side, and I think it is smart for you to stay here in the US a little bit longer.
[02:18:42.989 --> 02:18:46.209]  Hopefully, you're gonna come in studio soon, so we look forward to that.
[02:18:46.409 --> 02:18:48.989]  But I wanna come back and just talk about big picture here.
[02:18:49.250 --> 02:18:51.229]  All over the world, populists are being elected.
[02:18:52.039 --> 02:19:00.340]  And I've been predicting for years, and now you see it, that the more they squeeze in Germany, the more they're going to make the people vote for populist parties like the AfD.
[02:19:00.340 --> 02:19:05.420]  And you see that, and their attempt to ban it only made it from the fastest-growing party to now the number one party.
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:07.100]  And it's the same trend everywhere.
[02:19:07.319 --> 02:19:08.020]  So you're right.
[02:19:08.319 --> 02:19:11.239]  All the desperate deep state has left is false flags.
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:14.459]  We'll talk about that and Elon Musk and the future of humanity.
[02:19:14.459 --> 02:19:16.379]  Straight ahead with Naomi Zeiped.

[02:20:57.829 --> 02:21:05.170]  Well, Naomi Zeip is impressive, and she is a woman on the march against tyranny.
[02:21:05.389 --> 02:21:07.290]  For those that don't know, it's fascinating.
[02:21:07.290 --> 02:21:08.930]  I cover it in a few of my films like Endgame.
[02:21:09.309 --> 02:21:12.469]  The EU, starting in 1947, was a trade agreement.
[02:21:12.610 --> 02:21:17.069]  Officially became this ruling body in 1956, but no one really knew about it for decades.
[02:21:17.790 --> 02:21:19.709]  Then it created this parliament.
[02:21:19.709 --> 02:21:21.909]  It got governments to sign their authority over to it.
[02:21:22.229 --> 02:21:23.430]  It's unelected.
[02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:28.649]  And the parliament's elected, but it's ceremonial, and people are really talking about that now.
[02:21:28.809 --> 02:21:35.889]  So for them to lecture AFD as undemocratic when it's elected, Naomi, is just preposterous.
[02:21:36.760 --> 02:21:45.340]  Do you want to elaborate on that for viewers and then your predictions of what's coming next in Europe with the tyrannical EU? And then I know you don't want to get into inside baseball, but, you know, we've talked off air.
[02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:51.620]  Elon Musk did his research on AFD for a long time before he began openly supporting it.
[02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:53.219]  So let's talk about that.
[02:21:55.010 --> 02:22:03.010]  Yeah, obviously we know how bad the stigma is around anything related to German politics that is more on the right.
[02:22:03.409 --> 02:22:06.950]  We used to have two main establishment parties.
[02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:15.450]  That was the SPD and the CDU. And those two parties were basically just battling each other every time in the elections.
[02:22:16.649 --> 02:22:20.690]  Like the Republicans and the Democrats, but they were just two sides of the same coin.
[02:22:20.850 --> 02:22:27.709]  And then in 2013, the AfD was decreated because they were the first EU critic party.
[02:22:27.969 --> 02:22:29.690]  They were a very small party.
[02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:36.409]  And I remember specifically, actually, when I was only 14 years old, I had nothing to do with politics.
[02:22:36.610 --> 02:22:38.549]  I had no interest in politics and I knew nothing.
[02:22:39.090 --> 02:22:44.530]  But my mother was invited actually to a CDU event, so the Merkel party.
[02:22:45.190 --> 02:22:50.489]  Just a small event, but there was this one politician from the CDU. His name is Ruprecht Polenz.
[02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:54.409]  Germans will know who he is and he doesn't like me either.
[02:22:54.940 --> 02:23:06.659]  But he was there as the star guest, and I didn't look up to him, but I knew that he was famous in the CDU, and he was standing right behind Merkel, basically, at a big impact.
[02:23:06.920 --> 02:23:19.809]  And I remember when I was 14, 13, he said at this event, we need to do everything in our power to eliminate the AFD. And in that moment, I got chills.
[02:23:19.809 --> 02:23:21.629]  And I was thinking, something is wrong.
[02:23:21.629 --> 02:23:23.530]  That has nothing to do with democracy.
[02:23:24.270 --> 02:23:44.030]  And as the years went by and then the migration crisis started in Germany, that's when I was truly red-pilled because I started asking questions or criticizing the migration crisis simply because, yeah, I didn't realize there was so much stigma against anything that could be denounced as racist in some way.
[02:23:44.309 --> 02:23:51.760]  And I was wondering, why are my questions, Apparently politically incorrect.
[02:23:52.219 --> 02:23:53.579]  Why can I not ask questions?
[02:23:53.739 --> 02:24:02.059]  Why can I not be critical of government structures and anything that is restricting our freedom in Germany?
[02:24:02.459 --> 02:24:11.000]  And then I looked into different political ideologies and I found out a lot about libertarianism due to people like Stefan Molyneux, for example.
[02:24:11.180 --> 02:24:11.959]  You may still know him.
[02:24:12.319 --> 02:24:14.739]  And that's how I got into Joshua as well.
[02:24:15.049 --> 02:24:26.010]  And that truly red-pilled me and I kept following what the AFD was doing and I realized that they were the only ones standing up for our sovereignty and our freedom in Germany.
[02:24:26.430 --> 02:24:33.170]  And slowly but surely it just dawned upon me that free speech in Germany never really was a thing.
[02:24:33.350 --> 02:24:39.590]  And that just became more clear as the years went on and especially this year.
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:47.500]  The one, something that is written into our law is something like the Majesty Clause.
[02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:55.079]  It's paragraph 188 in our criminal code, which prohibits us from insulting politicians.
[02:24:55.260 --> 02:25:01.840]  So you're not even allowed to post a satirical meme about a politician calling him an idiot or a dimwit.
[02:25:03.310 --> 02:25:05.370]  And Canada is trying to pass similar laws.
[02:25:05.510 --> 02:25:08.889]  So is the UK. I mean, this is the model for the West.
[02:25:08.969 --> 02:25:11.090]  Now, you're going to be here next week with Nick Sordor.
[02:25:11.209 --> 02:25:12.510]  We're so excited late in the week.
[02:25:12.989 --> 02:25:14.389]  You're in Kentucky right now.
[02:25:16.250 --> 02:25:19.809]  Talking about Musk, and you were talking off air about how much research he does.
[02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:21.969]  And we'll just leave it at that.
[02:25:22.149 --> 02:25:25.469]  But, you know, into AFD, what a game changer Musk is.
[02:25:25.590 --> 02:25:26.989]  And I know the behind the scenes stuff, too.
[02:25:27.069 --> 02:25:28.149]  He really does his research.
[02:25:28.350 --> 02:25:30.809]  And as the globalists attack him, he's really gotten informed.
[02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:31.709]  They've got a big problem.
[02:25:31.850 --> 02:25:33.010]  Elon Musk is for real.
[02:25:33.229 --> 02:25:34.670]  What is your view on Elon Musk?
[02:25:36.149 --> 02:25:42.389]  What Elon Musk has done for free speech in the entire world or especially in the West is amazing.
[02:25:42.829 --> 02:25:47.770]  And I don't think enough people can even appreciate how much of an impact it really had.
[02:25:47.770 --> 02:25:59.370]  And it's not even about the numbers of how many people are on X. It's that the most impactful and the most intelligent people are on X. The people who really get it and the people who can make a change, because we are courageous, we are brave.
[02:25:59.709 --> 02:26:03.469]  And I know that Elon Musk doesn't just grab things out of thin air.
[02:26:03.610 --> 02:26:06.250]  He does his research extremely well.
[02:26:06.370 --> 02:26:09.909]  Not just because, obviously, he's incredibly intelligent.
[02:26:09.909 --> 02:26:11.629]  We don't have to argue about that.
[02:26:11.829 --> 02:26:15.409]  He's just on a million side quests at once, saving the world.
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:28.840]  Just for his ultimate goal to send us all to Mars and transform humanity as we know it and transform everything we know to be our status quo right now, which is, yeah, it's incredible.
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:41.500]  And I just know that when it comes to the AFD and German politics, he initially reached out to me already earlier this year when I wasn't that big in the public scene, I guess.
[02:26:42.229 --> 02:26:46.069]  Because you saw that I supported the AFD and I am not sponsored.
[02:26:46.209 --> 02:26:49.670]  I was never sponsored or anything by the AFD. I never got sent from them.
[02:26:49.790 --> 02:27:00.510]  I'm not even personally in touch with most of the leaders from the AFD. I just support them out of my integrity and my genuineness.
[02:27:01.299 --> 02:27:13.420]  And he asked me about the motivations of the AFD, because obviously, especially through the language barrier, what you hear about the AFD in the international media is just this, it's the Nazi Party, they are far-right extremists.
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:22.799]  And I explained to him that they are more like the liberal nationalist movement from the 19th century.
[02:27:24.569 --> 02:27:39.610]  Not like the Hitler nationalism, but the nationalism that we had during the time of the German Revolution around 1848. This revolution initially failed, and then the problem was that people gave up their freedom.
[02:27:39.909 --> 02:27:46.870]  They had the goals of forming Germany as a state, because Germany wasn't a nation, wasn't a state back then.
[02:27:47.690 --> 02:27:51.010]  And they gave up their freedom in order to form the state.
[02:27:51.170 --> 02:27:53.129]  So basically they lost liberalism.
[02:27:53.729 --> 02:27:55.870]  And only had nationalism at that point.
[02:28:13.750 --> 02:28:21.809]  We're good to go.
[02:28:32.139 --> 02:28:36.120]  And that's why we all need to exercise and defend everyone's free speech.
[02:28:36.340 --> 02:28:38.239]  Everybody should follow you on X right there.
[02:28:38.319 --> 02:28:39.639]  Everybody should follow me on Real Alex Jones.
[02:28:39.860 --> 02:28:43.639]  Take this live interview once it's archived, demand.video and Real Alex Jones and share it.
[02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:45.360]  Naomi, please post it on your page.
[02:28:45.399 --> 02:28:50.340]  And I look forward to meeting you in person with my great friend and fellow journalist, Nick Sordor, next week.
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:52.780]  Godspeed and have a wonderful Merry Christmas.
[02:28:53.559 --> 02:28:54.139]  Thank you.
[02:28:54.239 --> 02:28:55.299]  Merry Christmas to everyone.
[02:28:55.879 --> 02:28:56.799]  Thank you so much.
[02:28:56.879 --> 02:28:57.659]  What an amazing lady.
[02:28:58.450 --> 02:29:00.690]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back.
[02:29:00.850 --> 02:29:06.149]  We're about to expose LeBron James right now, and so much more is coming up as well.
[02:29:06.290 --> 02:29:06.770]  Stay with us.
[02:29:08.430 --> 02:29:13.750]  LeBron James famously said there's no party like a P. Diddy party.
[02:29:14.010 --> 02:29:16.549]  Hey, everybody know ain't no party like a Diddy party, so.
[02:29:16.969 --> 02:29:18.170]  Yeah, that's what's up.
[02:29:18.549 --> 02:29:19.010]  Yeah.
[02:29:38.059 --> 02:29:54.520]  As most of you know, I was the first person more than 15 years ago to begin to expose Jeffrey Epstein and his connections to CIA child trafficking operations where pedophilia is used to blackmail and control leaders of industry,
[02:29:55.319 --> 02:29:59.299]  academia, scientists, government, big tech, you name it.
[02:30:00.300 --> 02:30:16.639]  Since then, more and more has come out, even in mainstream news, about how different government officials and different intelligence agencies, including the CIA, have been using pedophile networks to control governments across our planet.
[02:30:17.959 --> 02:30:29.040]  Now, we've now learned about P. Diddy and all of his out-of-control sex parties and the evidence mounting that there were a lot of underage people at those as well.
[02:30:29.200 --> 02:30:35.180]  They were secretly videotaping it to then blackmail people in the entertainment industry.
[02:30:35.239 --> 02:30:40.440]  You have a lot of the same shadowy figures behind Jeffrey Epstein, also behind P. Diddy.
[02:30:40.559 --> 02:30:42.979]  You've got P. Diddy being a big Democrat.
[02:30:43.829 --> 02:30:50.569]  And so, clearly, there's a serious issue going on there, and P. Diddy is in prison awaiting trial right now.
[02:30:50.690 --> 02:30:55.530]  The only question is, will he supposedly hang himself like Jeffrey Epstein?
[02:30:55.629 --> 02:30:57.229]  There's three things that don't hang themselves.
[02:30:58.190 --> 02:31:01.510]  Drywall, Christmas tree lights, and Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:31:02.209 --> 02:31:07.889]  Now, LeBron James famously said there's no party like a P. Diddy party.
[02:31:08.450 --> 02:31:13.110]  And now when he goes out in public, people bring it up to him and he gets very, very upset.
[02:31:13.290 --> 02:31:15.770]  Hey, everybody know ain't no party like a Diddy party, so.
[02:31:16.209 --> 02:31:17.370]  Yeah, that's what's up.
[02:31:17.709 --> 02:31:18.110]  Yeah!
[02:31:19.270 --> 02:31:23.129]  That's what's up.
[02:31:23.590 --> 02:31:23.989]  Ron!
[02:31:24.729 --> 02:31:25.129]  Ron!
[02:31:26.129 --> 02:31:26.530]  Ron!
[02:31:26.989 --> 02:31:28.850]  We know you was at them Diddy parties!
[02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:31.120]  We know you was there.
[02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:33.620]  We know you was at them diddy parties.
[02:31:33.979 --> 02:31:41.479]  Other folks that claim they have information say that he is definitely a bad guy.
[02:31:41.719 --> 02:31:46.440]  From everything that I've read, if these allegations are true, there truly is no party like a diddy party.
[02:31:46.500 --> 02:31:47.319]  Because I don't know any party.
[02:31:47.399 --> 02:31:48.920]  I've been to a lot of parties in my youth.
[02:31:49.120 --> 02:31:58.420]  Never did we have pink cocaine in bottles and thousands of bottles of baby oil and people that were ******.
[02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:59.829]  Sleeping with each other.
[02:31:59.989 --> 02:32:00.549]  We just did not.
[02:32:00.649 --> 02:32:06.030]  So it could be just factually a true statement to say that there ain't no party like a Diddy party.
[02:32:06.549 --> 02:32:11.590]  Now let me show you this clip of him partying with Diddy dancing to Amigos song.
[02:32:11.790 --> 02:32:12.510]  Take a listen.
[02:32:12.829 --> 02:32:24.489]  We're good to go.
[02:32:24.510 --> 02:32:27.309]  We're good to go.
[02:32:28.290 --> 02:32:31.069]  We're good to go.
[02:32:36.709 --> 02:32:39.129]  Well, it looks like he's having a really good time.
[02:32:39.270 --> 02:32:41.290]  It looks like he's had a lot of time with Diddy.
[02:32:41.389 --> 02:32:42.590]  They've been friends for years.
[02:32:42.930 --> 02:32:44.750]  They're always hugging, dapping up.
[02:32:44.889 --> 02:32:46.329]  Bad boys for life, right?
[02:32:47.610 --> 02:32:52.149]  I'm going to start this off, you know, since I'm the man of the hour, the man of the show.
[02:32:52.930 --> 02:32:58.510]  I want to ask LeBron, what does he mean by there's no party like a Diddy party?
[02:32:58.750 --> 02:32:59.909]  I truly want to know.
[02:33:00.270 --> 02:33:04.690]  And not only that, LeBron, how many Diddy parties have you actually been to?
[02:33:05.010 --> 02:33:06.489]  I'm really curious to know.
[02:33:06.790 --> 02:33:08.930]  And is that the reason you left social media?
[02:33:09.049 --> 02:33:12.409]  Because all the backlash you were getting for going to so many Diddy parties?
[02:33:13.250 --> 02:33:15.049]  It's just pathetic, man.
[02:33:15.170 --> 02:33:16.510]  People think this guy's a role model.
[02:33:16.709 --> 02:33:22.010]  He wants to defund the police, the most patriot people of America serving and protecting our country.
[02:33:23.020 --> 02:33:28.200]  LeBron, you're a f***ing scumbag and I hope you get locked up in the same cell with Diddy.
[02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:35.719]  I don't know if LeBron James has been involved in anything unethical or illegal.
[02:33:36.670 --> 02:33:48.149]  But what I can tell you is that a lot of Hollywood people that have been connected to P. Diddy, Epstein, and others have been leaving the United States in droves.
[02:33:48.350 --> 02:33:51.809]  Many of them have been claiming it's because President Trump's coming back into office.
[02:33:52.190 --> 02:34:10.920]  But a lot of the researchers and experts looking at these networks that emanate out of the intelligence agencies in Hollywood as one of its other well-known networks, For lack of a better term, headquarters or motherships were predicting that we would see this mass exodus.
[02:34:11.299 --> 02:34:26.319]  So I got a call last week from one of my sources saying that he'd heard from other good sources that LeBron James had, of course, taken this leave of absence from the Lakers for a while, just recently returned to break some records,
[02:34:26.540 --> 02:34:30.360]  and that he reportedly was thinking about leaving the country.
[02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:43.280]  Then, this morning, I talked to a very trusted source I know, and I'm not gonna give up the specifics, because it'll obviously expose to LeBron James who we're talking about.
[02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:47.819]  But this piece of information has not hit the news yet.
[02:34:48.139 --> 02:34:55.040]  So last year, LeBron James sold his $18.5 million mansion in Miami.
[02:34:55.979 --> 02:35:12.319]  But in the last two weeks, according to my sources, he has sold his $20 million mansion inside some of these, this very elite giant condo estate system.
[02:35:12.540 --> 02:35:19.840]  And I looked it up, and reportedly they're saying some prominent people have sold there, but they're not saying it's LeBron James.
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:37.200]  Now, according to my second source, LeBron James, He said in front of these individuals that he was moving to Europe and that maybe he would play basketball over in the European leagues.
[02:35:37.420 --> 02:35:41.879]  So I am not saying this is 100% because of the P Diddy.
[02:35:42.940 --> 02:35:51.399]  But at the same time, it certainly needs to be investigated by other investigative journalists and others, and it's something to watch.
[02:35:51.659 --> 02:35:58.059]  Because when you see the history of him and P. Diddy, it looks mighty suspicious.
[02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:01.920]  So, the House of Cards is coming down.
[02:36:03.079 --> 02:36:07.440]  We know the Democratic Party and other leftist parties around the world are heavily involved in pedophilia.
[02:36:07.719 --> 02:36:13.959]  We know you can't swing a stick in the dark in Hollywood or the music industry and not run into Satanism and pedophilia.
[02:36:14.079 --> 02:36:16.159]  I mean, hell, they're even promoting it openly.
[02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:29.479]  So I'm really sad if this is the case, but what I do know is LeBron James has made famous comments about he doesn't care about Uyghurs, he doesn't care about China enslaving political dissidents, and he only thinks about himself.
[02:36:29.479 --> 02:36:32.420]  So he is a very selfish person.
[02:36:34.149 --> 02:36:38.110]  And as far as I'm concerned, he's everything wrong with this country.
[02:36:38.469 --> 02:36:43.829]  And so as far as I'm concerned, don't let the door hit you on the ass.
[02:36:44.049 --> 02:36:45.329]  The NBA is collapsing.
[02:36:45.489 --> 02:36:47.829]  Its ratings are way down because of all the political correctness.
[02:36:48.049 --> 02:36:51.549]  Even got NBA coaches saying they don't watch it anymore because of it.
[02:36:51.709 --> 02:36:55.370]  A lot of discussion around NBA ratings and ratings being down.
[02:36:55.549 --> 02:36:56.309]  What are the reasons for that?
[02:36:56.370 --> 02:36:56.989]  Is it the product?
[02:36:57.110 --> 02:36:57.729]  Is it the messaging?
[02:36:57.989 --> 02:36:58.610]  Is it other things?
[02:36:58.889 --> 02:37:00.389]  Do you have any thoughts on that?
[02:37:00.569 --> 02:37:02.530]  Is it a competition you pay attention to at all?
[02:37:02.610 --> 02:37:07.530]  And do you have any thoughts on how the game is discussed or sold that maybe is contributing to it?
[02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:08.870]  No, I mean, I add to that.
[02:37:09.010 --> 02:37:12.870]  I don't watch NBA games, so I'm just as follows as anyone else's.
[02:37:13.649 --> 02:37:14.790]  Is there a reason for that?
[02:37:15.329 --> 02:37:16.350]  I don't like watching the games.
[02:37:17.239 --> 02:37:27.219]  And so I see the NBA, the NFL, Hollywood as all of it is a sick distraction that mesmerized America while our country was hijacked by the globalists.
[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:31.719]  And part of this great awakening is people basically turning it off.
[02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:42.440]  I'm sure if professional sports stops Promoting DEI and transgenderism and taking, you know, knees during the national anthem, it'll become popular again.
[02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:57.319]  But at the end of the day, it's just like the Roman Coliseum, bread and circuses, I love sports, it's fine to be in sports, it's okay to be into sports some, but when your country and the world is on the verge of nuclear war, the average man only caring about sports is sick.
[02:37:57.860 --> 02:38:12.059]  So, at the end of the day, these so-called idols, because they can put a ball in a basket or run a ball down the field, is really a distraction from the real heroes in our world that fight for freedom, that take care of their families, that work so hard, and who are ethical.
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:23.639]  So for myself and the entire crew, I want to wish you all a Merry Christmas, and we'll continue to watch the collapsing house of cards in and around Pedogate that is bringing down the globalists and Mayorkas.
[02:38:24.049 --> 02:38:29.409]  Coming out yesterday and saying, it's not my job, it's not our jurisdiction to care about kidnapped or missing kids.
[02:38:29.690 --> 02:38:40.989]  ICE was also unable to account for more than 32,000 unaccompanied kids who failed to appear in court from 2019 to 2023, according to the report we read.
[02:38:41.350 --> 02:38:48.850]  The incoming boarders are Tom Homan says these children are being exploited and trafficked.
[02:38:49.049 --> 02:38:49.969]  Is that true?
[02:38:50.610 --> 02:39:06.690]  Well, Margaret, we certainly have received reports of children being trafficked, even those As to whom we know where they are, that is outside the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:39:06.909 --> 02:39:17.530]  What we do is we turn children over within 72 hours, as the law requires, to the Department of Health and Human Services, and then HHS places those children.
[02:39:17.899 --> 02:39:30.639]  When it's in the federal law that that's their jurisdiction, and they helped complete the smuggling, stopped the DNA testing, and delivered tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of children around the country to so-called sponsors with no paperwork or no evidence.
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:32.319]  That is criminal.
[02:39:32.799 --> 02:39:37.639]  And when you and I fly back into the country, they ask us questions when you're flying with your family.
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:39.540]  They ask your kids, is this your daddy?
[02:39:39.579 --> 02:39:40.239]  Is this your mommy?
[02:39:40.420 --> 02:39:41.319]  And they should.
[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:45.459]  To make sure that you're not trafficking and to stop trafficking.
[02:39:45.700 --> 02:39:48.459]  But when you're smuggling in kids, they don't want to see any paperwork.
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:49.700]  They don't want to do any DNA testing.
[02:39:49.899 --> 02:39:51.180]  You can't prove it's your kid.
[02:39:51.319 --> 02:39:54.399]  And we know many of them end up in slave labor and sex trafficking.
[02:39:54.579 --> 02:40:00.680]  So we can ask all day, you know, was LeBron James involved in creepy stuff with P. Diddy?
[02:40:01.350 --> 02:40:04.469]  He certainly said the parties were the best, but we don't know that.
[02:40:04.590 --> 02:40:21.750]  But we do know Mayorkas has committed the greatest human trafficking and sex smuggling in modern history in front of the world and the incoming Borders are, Tom Homan has said Trump is greenlit, criminal investigations of the grassroots traffickers up to the NGOs,
[02:40:22.129 --> 02:40:34.729]  the non-profits, the for-profits, and the State Department and DHS. So that is good, but at the same time, I don't want to distract with theorizing about LeBron James and P. Diddy.
[02:40:34.909 --> 02:40:41.969]  It's okay to look at it, it's okay to research it, but we don't know for sure yet, though it's looking interesting, especially if he does flee the country, as I've been told.
[02:40:42.879 --> 02:40:53.200]  But regardless, the proof is Mayorkas and what they did and Joe Biden's daughter in her diary saying, hey, I think my dad molested me in the shower.
[02:40:53.639 --> 02:40:57.020]  I mean, that's where we know this is really going on.
[02:40:57.139 --> 02:41:06.260]  And so we need to continue to not just investigate, but to call for the deep state's prosecution for human trafficking, child sex slavery, and more.
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:16.399]  Now, those are some heavy topics, but the children that are still in bondage and others right now are praying for God to deliver them, and God works through us to get out there and get that done.
[02:41:16.540 --> 02:41:17.440]  So God bless you all.
[02:41:17.639 --> 02:41:18.520]  Have a wonderful Christmas.
[02:41:18.639 --> 02:41:19.239]  Thank you so much.
[02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:32.000]  We are making this announcement on the eve of Christmas 2024. And this is a major gift to liberty and freedom in the information war.

[02:45:35.700 --> 02:45:37.540]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:44.040]  Trump is officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal human trafficking and sex slavery.
[02:45:44.260 --> 02:45:47.319]  We're going to take control January 20th, and people are going to be held accountable.

[02:45:53.440 --> 02:45:55.020]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[02:45:55.149 --> 02:45:59.290]  We're going to be very transparent American people, and we're going to tell them the truth of what happened on this border.
[02:45:59.430 --> 02:46:00.750]  Again, by design.
[02:46:00.930 --> 02:46:02.430]  And so much more is happening.
[02:46:02.530 --> 02:46:03.450]  This is an exciting time.
[02:46:03.709 --> 02:46:05.649]  But the globalists are striking back.
[02:46:05.790 --> 02:46:09.729]  That's why it's important to keep our operation on air now more than ever.

[02:46:37.770 --> 02:46:40.030]  And the family and friends will have so much fun.
[02:46:40.030 --> 02:46:41.350]  It's a great conversation piece.
[02:46:41.690 --> 02:46:43.469]  And this will horrify me.
[02:46:43.629 --> 02:46:48.250]  Leftists, and then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall, shaking in fear, walking on the street.
[02:46:48.370 --> 02:46:48.909]  Say, it's okay.
[02:46:49.329 --> 02:46:54.030]  Alex Jones doesn't bite, though it kind of does look like I'm Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.

[02:47:04.729 --> 02:47:06.450]  Trump won, I'm afraid.
[02:47:06.850 --> 02:47:13.569]  While you're there, believe me, If you love our information, you're gonna love the supplements like Ultimate Sea Moss.
[02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:15.409]  That is the ultimate superfood.
[02:47:15.690 --> 02:47:17.850]  It's the strongest, one of the strongest out there.

[02:48:06.719 --> 02:48:12.940]  I'd heard about CMOS being a superfood, our CMOS namely, but the folks are bigly saying, you're recommending all these supplements and that's great.
[02:48:13.469 --> 02:48:21.770]  Kind of got your vitaminal fusion with electrolytes, that's hydroforce, and a great gut cleanse, and a great probiotic, and energy gummies, and sleep gummies.
[02:48:21.870 --> 02:48:24.129]  Those are all great, Mr. Jones, but he's a great guy.

[02:48:24.969 --> 02:48:28.649]  They're like, but have you looked at the CMOS? We've got one of the top suppliers that'll let us private label it.
[02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:32.909]  And I looked at it, and I was like, oh my God, this is the superfood other than maybe hemp.
[02:48:33.510 --> 02:48:34.909]  But it does other effects than him.

[02:49:00.930 --> 02:49:03.170]  Pretty dangerous for me and Trump, but we wouldn't be anywhere else.
[02:49:03.370 --> 02:49:05.649]  Thanks for keeping me and President Trump with a fight.
[02:49:05.870 --> 02:49:06.909]  God bless and good luck.
[02:49:07.329 --> 02:49:08.530]  Oh, and I almost forgot.
[02:49:09.549 --> 02:49:11.430]  Merry, Merry Christmas to everybody.
[02:49:11.590 --> 02:49:14.489]  That's so triggering to the left, but I also love Christmas.
[02:49:14.850 --> 02:49:18.229]  And a Happy New Year with President Trump about to come into office.
[02:49:18.649 --> 02:49:20.530]  Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:20.530 --> 02:49:21.750]  This is The Alex Jones Show.
[02:49:21.850 --> 02:49:24.590]  I'm Harrison Smith, sitting in for Alex this hour.
[02:49:24.590 --> 02:49:25.989]  And what an hour we have.
[02:49:25.989 --> 02:49:28.229]  I've got some breaking news I want to get to.
[02:49:28.309 --> 02:49:31.569]  Some very big news, in fact, that you're not going to want to miss.
[02:49:31.569 --> 02:49:33.309]  A couple pretty powerful videos.
[02:49:33.510 --> 02:49:41.010]  But really what I want to do with this hour, since it is Christmas Eve, this live Christmas Eve broadcast, I feel bad talking about...
[02:49:41.780 --> 02:49:45.579]  You know, sex trafficking and people being burned alive on the subway.
[02:49:45.739 --> 02:49:49.239]  Nobody wants to hear that on this The Holiest of Nights.
[02:49:49.379 --> 02:49:51.120]  So we are going to talk about that.
[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:52.219]  We are going to get into the news.
[02:49:52.379 --> 02:50:00.579]  We are going to get into some of the bombshell stories that have just broken over the last few hours while Alex was on air, including some pretty incredible videos.
[02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:01.979]  I am going to get to that.
[02:50:02.139 --> 02:50:04.620]  I am going to do my due diligence and cover the news.
[02:50:05.360 --> 02:50:11.500]  But mainly I want to celebrate the incredible victories that we're having really across the entire globe.
[02:50:12.490 --> 02:50:34.440]  And these things happen every once in a while but maybe we don't do a good enough job of sort of taking a break pausing for a second and reminiscing over the just incredible year 2024 has been It's like everything that Alex Jones talked about for the last 30 years is now just on the forefront.
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:50.500]  The main topic of conversation, everything from fluoride being poison, seed oils and the MAHA movement with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the vaccine skepticism that now has a firm hold in our federal government.
[02:50:50.500 --> 02:50:52.559]  And we should be seeing some big changes there.
[02:50:53.299 --> 02:51:04.159]  It's been just a year of unprecedented success, but also that comes with unprecedented pushback from the globalists as they realize that they're losing their grip and they're getting increasingly desperate.
[02:51:04.459 --> 02:51:18.700]  But overall, I think what this does for our audience is gives us an incredible opportunity for spreading the word, an incredible opportunity for telling people about what's really behind all of these seemingly separate occurrences.
[02:51:18.979 --> 02:51:32.000]  In other words, it's not that they're Accidentally poisoning us with fluoride and accidentally implementing digital ID. All of these things are different facets of what the ultimate goal of the globalists is, which is a one-world government.
[02:51:32.620 --> 02:51:39.139]  And now is like the most amazing time for red-pilling your friends and family, especially around the holidays.
[02:51:39.280 --> 02:51:46.420]  And I know a lot of our audience may be listening to my voice on their way to a big Christmas Eve dinner, a big Christmas celebration with their family.
[02:51:46.600 --> 02:52:02.030]  Some of you may be looking forward to Laughing with your red-pilled friends and family about what this year has brought, but probably maybe even a larger portion will be heading towards a family that is still blue-pilled,
[02:52:02.149 --> 02:52:04.670]  unfortunately, and has to be shown the light.
[02:52:04.829 --> 02:52:15.729]  So I really want to take your calls about how to red-pill your family, because it's a delicate procedure you have to carry on, but it's, I think, your responsibility to do it.
[02:52:16.700 --> 02:52:21.500]  I was showing a tweet earlier today on American Journal, and it puts it very simply.
[02:52:21.780 --> 02:52:30.459]  If everyone listening to me is able to red pill two people, and those two people are able to red pill two more people, that's exponential growth.
[02:52:30.620 --> 02:52:32.440]  That is actually how we take back this country.
[02:52:32.579 --> 02:52:40.520]  Because as of yet, we still don't have the institutional power or the positions at the top of academia to spread our ideas to the masses.
[02:52:44.100 --> 02:52:53.040]  We're good to go.
[02:53:01.110 --> 02:53:03.790]  The way I was putting this, it's like catching a butterfly.
[02:53:03.930 --> 02:53:06.530]  You can't just reach out and try to snatch it out of the air.
[02:53:06.649 --> 02:53:11.309]  You're gonna damage it, or you're gonna scare it away, or it's just gonna float away on the breeze.
[02:53:11.450 --> 02:53:12.809]  You gotta let it come to you.
[02:53:12.909 --> 02:53:15.129]  You gotta answer the questions and...
[02:53:17.510 --> 02:53:34.069]  We're good to go.
[02:53:34.399 --> 02:53:42.700]  In the news over the last hour or so, as I was watching Alex and perusing InfoWars.com and other websites to gather this information.
[02:53:42.899 --> 02:53:43.459]  So stay tuned.
[02:53:43.639 --> 02:53:46.059]  Very big hour on this Christmas Eve.
[02:53:46.239 --> 02:53:50.799]  I'm Harrison Smith, and I will be taking your calls, opening up the phone lines at the beginning of the next segment.
[02:53:51.040 --> 02:53:51.840]  Stay tuned for that.
[02:53:51.879 --> 02:53:56.040]  And of course, go to TheAlexJonesStore.com to support everything that we do here.
[02:53:56.139 --> 02:53:57.239]  We could not do it without you.
[02:53:57.639 --> 02:54:02.159]  And already, the success we have is more than enough reason to support us.
[02:54:02.260 --> 02:54:03.879]  But folks, this is just the beginning.
[02:54:04.620 --> 02:54:06.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:06.159 --> 02:54:07.440]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:07.760 --> 02:54:16.780]  I'm your host, Harrison Smith, coming to you live this Christmas Eve, December 24th, 2024. I'm going to go ahead and open up the phone lines right now.
[02:54:16.780 --> 02:54:21.239]  If you want to give us a call, the number to dial is 1-877-789-2539.
[02:54:21.540 --> 02:54:24.319]  That's 1-877-789-2539.
[02:54:24.559 --> 02:54:28.760]  Taking your calls now, specifically on the topic of red-pilling your friends and family.
[02:54:28.860 --> 02:54:29.719]  Do you have advice?
[02:54:30.020 --> 02:54:31.659]  On how to red pill your friends and family.
[02:54:31.799 --> 02:54:35.219]  Have you tried to red pill your friends and family and had some trouble?
[02:54:35.379 --> 02:54:38.639]  Do you have questions, suggestions, answers, concerns?
[02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:39.299]  Give us a call.
[02:54:39.440 --> 02:54:42.520]  1-877-789-2539.
[02:54:42.799 --> 02:54:45.299]  That's 1-877-789-2539.
[02:54:45.540 --> 02:54:47.700]  And we will be taking your calls throughout this hour.
[02:54:47.819 --> 02:54:52.219]  But we've got some very big news to cover as the phone calls come pouring in.
[02:54:53.260 --> 02:55:01.139]  But again, just in case you missed the first five minutes or some radio stations don't carry it, we are talking about red-pilling your family members on this Christmas holiday.
[02:55:01.340 --> 02:55:10.739]  I imagine there are a lot of people driving now to perhaps what they may think is going to be an uncomfortable dinner with some liberal family members.
[02:55:11.879 --> 02:55:14.079]  But I think something very unique is happening right now.
[02:55:14.239 --> 02:55:20.879]  There is an opportunity right now that is really unprecedented in my memory and really in my life.
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:26.829]  The Division of America between left and right, it's getting a little blurred.
[02:55:27.309 --> 02:55:29.469]  There's a bit of an overlap happening.
[02:55:29.709 --> 02:55:35.270]  There's another quadrant that has opened up of populist versus elitist.
[02:55:35.889 --> 02:55:39.510]  And we find ourselves on the same sides on a lot of issues.
[02:55:39.850 --> 02:55:55.709]  We talked about this on American Journal this morning, and a lot of people were pointing out The easy topics to sort of ease in to these conversations with, things like health, things like poison in the food and water, or GMO,
[02:55:55.850 --> 02:55:58.510]  and water filters, stuff like that.
[02:55:58.629 --> 02:56:05.389]  Not only has it become much more of a prominent talking point with the likes of RFK Jr., just...
[02:56:05.939 --> 02:56:10.659]  Bashing this information out for everybody to see and Donald Trump getting on board with that.
[02:56:11.139 --> 02:56:14.540]  But also it is something that just crosses party lines.
[02:56:14.680 --> 02:56:19.600]  You don't have to be a Republican or a Democrat to not want poison in your food and water and to be aware of that.
[02:56:20.020 --> 02:56:26.049]  Even COVID and the vaccines and the lockdowns, all of it has come out over this last year.
[02:56:26.209 --> 02:56:37.829]  This last year has been the year of revelation when it's come to the follies and not follies, I should correct myself, the blatant and purposeful lies of COVID-19.
[02:56:38.030 --> 02:56:41.129]  The lockdowns, the vaccines, the mask, all of that.
[02:56:41.209 --> 02:56:42.950]  They've basically dropped the pretense at this point.
[02:56:43.069 --> 02:56:44.649]  They've stopped trying to lie.
[02:56:44.770 --> 02:56:45.790]  They admit it's a lab leak.
[02:56:46.239 --> 02:57:06.360]  We're good to go.
[02:57:11.360 --> 02:57:16.639]  Policy or topic that I would think that you could reach out across the aisle and find agreement on.
[02:57:16.780 --> 02:57:18.219]  Don't we all hate war?
[02:57:18.399 --> 02:57:20.780]  Don't we all want to see peace on Earth?
[02:57:20.959 --> 02:57:22.780]  I mean, isn't this something we can come together on?
[02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:31.739]  So really, I think now is such a brilliant time to come together as Americans, but it's not even an American thing.
[02:57:31.860 --> 02:57:32.700]  It's a global thing.
[02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:38.440]  And obviously, Alex was talking about this with Naomi over the last hour and throughout the show.
[02:57:39.829 --> 02:57:42.969]  But this is one of the things, it's one of the powers of the mainstream media.
[02:57:43.430 --> 02:57:56.510]  Not only can they establish narrative trends in the minds of the American people, they can make the American people think things like, the police are hunting black men for sport because of one or two deaths in the hands of police.
[02:57:57.049 --> 02:57:57.670]  Of black men.
[02:57:57.790 --> 02:58:08.750]  It's just, you know, they'll take one or two data points and paint this as if it's happening every hour, every day, and eventually you get to the point where people in street interviews and stuff are asked, how many black people do you think are killed by police?
[02:58:08.829 --> 02:58:10.590]  And they say, oh, probably 10,000 a year.
[02:58:10.709 --> 02:58:15.579]  And it's just like, all right, the actual number is Really in the double digits if you get right down to it.
[02:58:15.819 --> 02:58:17.680]  So they plant false narratives.
[02:58:17.879 --> 02:58:21.079]  They plant false storylines, essentially, that gets planted in people's minds.
[02:58:21.239 --> 02:58:25.020]  The flip side of that is they can bury trends that do exist.
[02:58:25.219 --> 02:58:28.440]  They can report on them independently and not draw the lines.
[02:58:28.719 --> 02:58:31.500]  And the fact is, most people won't connect the lines themselves.
[02:58:33.110 --> 02:58:43.510]  We're good to go.
[02:58:51.800 --> 02:58:55.059]  We're good to go.
[02:59:09.540 --> 02:59:10.840]  But can you not recognize the trend?
[02:59:11.020 --> 02:59:15.100]  The trend here is that the establishment is collapsing across the board.
[02:59:15.420 --> 02:59:27.579]  Basically every country that has been suppressing its people and oppressing its people and flooding its own country with foreigners in a deliberate attempt to eradicate the native population there.
[02:59:28.340 --> 02:59:29.639]  They're not putting up with it anymore.
[02:59:29.879 --> 02:59:31.000]  They're standing up against it.
[02:59:31.159 --> 02:59:36.139]  The marches that we see in Germany following the terrorist attack in Magdeburg is just one small example.
[02:59:36.840 --> 02:59:43.180]  Canada, of course, suffering under the leadership of Trudeau, who might not last that much longer.
[02:59:43.399 --> 02:59:45.040]  Major changes happening there.
[02:59:45.239 --> 02:59:47.540]  Across the world, populism is rising.
[02:59:47.739 --> 02:59:52.459]  The victory of Donald Trump is just one bellwether of what's actually happening around the world.
[02:59:52.579 --> 02:59:54.360]  Mass deportations, not just in America.
[02:59:55.049 --> 03:00:00.489]  But in Europe under the name remigration, this is taking hold and becoming an incredibly popular position to hold.
[03:00:00.670 --> 03:00:21.469]  This is unprecedented success, and the collapse of the left worldwide has given us an unprecedented opening to discuss these things with our friends and family and hopefully make a difference from the ground up since we still don't have that top-down control that we will get if we persist and insist on what we know to be true.
[03:00:23.239 --> 03:00:25.159]  So this is an incredibly powerful thing.
[03:00:25.379 --> 03:00:28.000]  I'm very excited to see where it goes from here.
[03:00:28.100 --> 03:00:32.659]  This is an opportunity that we've never had before, and it's up to us to make sure we don't squander it.
[03:00:33.459 --> 03:00:42.520]  I'm going to go out to your phone calls about how to do this and advice people have, because like I said, you can make things worse if you approach it in the wrong way.
[03:00:42.659 --> 03:00:47.180]  And The way I like to think about this is with a quote actually from the Hippocratic Oath.
[03:00:47.440 --> 03:00:52.440]  And the Hippocratic Oath, of course, is for doctors, but I think it's pertinent for what we do here as well.
[03:00:52.579 --> 03:01:04.520]  Since we are physicians of a sort, we're trying to heal America from this infection of leftism that is destroying us from the inside like a cancer that's metastasized.
[03:01:05.540 --> 03:01:12.559]  And that is the quote from the Hippocratic Oath that says, you must avoid the twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.
[03:01:12.799 --> 03:01:18.520]  In medicine, obviously, overtreatment would be you make things worse by trying everything and it doesn't work.
[03:01:18.659 --> 03:01:24.719]  Therapeutic nihilism is when you say, it's over, the patient's going to die, so let's just make them comfortable and just give up.
[03:01:25.930 --> 03:01:33.030]  And in terms of red-pilling your friends and family, overtreatment would be, well, starting off with something a little bit too intense.
[03:01:33.030 --> 03:01:41.010]  You can't expect normies to go right for the hardcore, you know, they want to kill your children type of rhetoric.
[03:01:41.010 --> 03:01:42.389]  Obviously, that's where you want to lead them.
[03:01:42.590 --> 03:01:44.889]  Eventually, it is true, and they need to know that.
[03:01:45.670 --> 03:01:47.489]  But you've got to know how to ease them into it.
[03:01:47.610 --> 03:01:51.209]  Whereas therapeutic nihilism is what you call the black pill, where you say it's all hopeless.
[03:01:51.350 --> 03:01:52.129]  Who cares?
[03:01:52.250 --> 03:01:54.809]  I could red pill these people, but what would be the point of that?
[03:01:55.770 --> 03:01:56.709]  It's all over.
[03:01:57.329 --> 03:01:58.629]  The bad guys are in control.
[03:01:58.649 --> 03:02:00.389]  I'm just going to give up.
[03:02:01.399 --> 03:02:02.620]  And we've got to avoid that too.
[03:02:02.780 --> 03:02:09.899]  So how do we avoid these twin traps of overtreatment or therapeutic nihilism in the topic of red-pilling your friends and family?
[03:02:09.940 --> 03:02:15.040]  How do you do it in a way that is both approachable and understandable by the normies, but also...
[03:02:16.010 --> 03:02:18.069]  You know, is something you can actually achieve.
[03:02:18.430 --> 03:02:36.930]  And I feel like the reason I'm excited about this and hammering this home is because probably the only success I've really had in like actually converting people, changing sort of normies to being red-pilled and based is in times like this.
[03:02:37.069 --> 03:02:43.590]  Either on road trips where you have a couple hours just to talk and you can just field their questions and help sort of guide them down the path of understanding.
[03:02:43.889 --> 03:02:45.170]  Or holiday...
[03:02:47.150 --> 03:02:53.110]  Family events where you're sitting with an uncle or an aunt or a cousin and you just get to hang out and chat for a while.
[03:02:53.290 --> 03:03:00.290]  And it's in these times where you can spend the necessary time to sort of explain, look, this is where this started.
[03:03:00.450 --> 03:03:01.409]  This is where it's going.
[03:03:01.649 --> 03:03:03.629]  This is how they're doing it.
[03:03:03.809 --> 03:03:05.569]  And actually elaborate on that.
[03:03:05.670 --> 03:03:08.409]  But you can't do it if you're just arguing and yelling at each other.
[03:03:08.489 --> 03:03:17.309]  And plus, at the end of the day, The biggest victory is just being happy, enjoying your family, showing that, you know...
[03:03:17.309 --> 03:03:26.889]  Frankly, a lot of people get scared away from conspiracy theories because they may have a friend or family that went too deep, went too hard into the rabbit hole, and...
[03:03:28.129 --> 03:03:29.450]  Doesn't have fun anymore.
[03:03:29.750 --> 03:03:30.629]  You gotta be able to have fun.
[03:03:30.750 --> 03:03:41.750]  You gotta be able to be the example of what we promote, which is family and love of God and patriotism, and also genuine love of humanity of every race, color, and creed.
[03:03:41.850 --> 03:03:44.530]  And that is what converts people to the red pill.
[03:03:44.649 --> 03:03:51.709]  So we'll be dishing out red pill missiles here, firing them at our beloved enemies.
[03:03:52.819 --> 03:03:54.219]  I do want to start with a couple videos though.
[03:03:54.440 --> 03:04:10.149]  This video is from London and I don't want to repeat myself, but if you're watching American Journal this morning, you heard me talk about the fact that when I was a young, dumb kid who still thought that The Daily Show was a valid source of news,
[03:04:10.329 --> 03:04:14.170]  I remember thinking that this idea of the war on Christmas was so silly.
[03:04:14.510 --> 03:04:17.389]  What a dumb thing for people to be concerned about.
[03:04:17.670 --> 03:04:21.909]  So Starbucks writes Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas.
[03:04:22.229 --> 03:04:23.309]  What's the big deal?
[03:04:23.489 --> 03:04:25.370]  And the big deal is that that was the...
[03:04:26.399 --> 03:04:27.459]  That was the first attack.
[03:04:27.899 --> 03:04:29.639]  It's all about incrementalism.
[03:04:29.739 --> 03:04:40.920]  And if you don't stand up to them right away, then eventually you get down the line to a point where they are literally telling you you're not allowed to say the word Christmas because it's offensive to non-Christians.
[03:04:41.059 --> 03:04:54.940]  That's where they've arrived in the UK. Here's a piece from GBN News from London where they go around a winter market and talk to the stall owners and vendors who say they're not allowed to say the word Christmas.
[03:04:54.959 --> 03:04:55.739]  Let's watch.
[03:04:59.879 --> 03:05:04.139]  So we've just come down to what is described as London's biggest Christmas market.
[03:05:04.299 --> 03:05:11.260]  The only problem is they've called it, if you follow me, they've called it a winter come together.
[03:05:12.260 --> 03:05:25.420]  So my challenge now is to find anywhere in this market that says the word Christmas, maybe the word Jesus, any indication that this is indeed a religious holiday in the UK. We've got winter warmers.
[03:05:26.190 --> 03:05:27.729]  Winter warmers at the winter market.
[03:05:27.989 --> 03:05:29.469]  Is this a Christmas market?
[03:05:29.670 --> 03:05:30.549]  It's a winter market.
[03:05:30.729 --> 03:05:31.590]  A winter market.
[03:05:31.790 --> 03:05:32.409]  What's the difference?
[03:05:33.290 --> 03:05:34.469]  It's something to do with religion.
[03:05:34.610 --> 03:05:35.510]  They can't say Christmas.
[03:05:35.889 --> 03:05:41.049]  So, apparently the stall traders here have been told they can't say the word Christmas.
[03:05:41.889 --> 03:05:44.270]  Happy Christmas or Happy Holidays?
[03:05:45.859 --> 03:05:46.379]  Both.
[03:05:46.680 --> 03:05:47.399]  Why both?
[03:05:47.860 --> 03:05:48.940]  It's Christmas, isn't it?
[03:05:49.100 --> 03:05:49.920]  It's Christmas, yeah.
[03:05:50.579 --> 03:05:51.659]  Why would you say happy holidays?
[03:05:51.760 --> 03:05:52.219]  Which scenario?
[03:05:53.760 --> 03:05:56.459]  Because not everybody celebrates Christmas.
[03:05:57.040 --> 03:05:58.760]  Happy holidays or happy Christmas?
[03:05:59.000 --> 03:05:59.739]  Oh, happy Christmas.
[03:06:00.139 --> 03:06:01.420]  Absolutely happy Christmas.
[03:06:01.799 --> 03:06:02.420]  Whoa, hang on a minute.
[03:06:02.600 --> 03:06:02.899]  Christmas?
[03:06:03.260 --> 03:06:04.659]  You'll offend people saying that.
[03:06:04.840 --> 03:06:05.159]  I know.
[03:06:05.639 --> 03:06:06.540]  Happy holidays?
[03:06:06.780 --> 03:06:07.299]  Happy Christmas.
[03:06:07.520 --> 03:06:08.100]  Winter market?
[03:06:09.120 --> 03:06:10.059]  Christmas market.
[03:06:10.360 --> 03:06:12.879]  This is the first sign of Christmas I've seen in this market.
[03:06:14.319 --> 03:06:15.100]  Oh, good man.
[03:06:15.180 --> 03:06:15.600]  Look at that.
[03:06:16.280 --> 03:06:17.219]  He's in the spirit.
[03:06:18.219 --> 03:06:18.920]  So what have you got here?
[03:06:19.040 --> 03:06:23.819]  You've got a mulled gin, which is from the winter market, not Christmas.
[03:06:26.040 --> 03:06:29.319]  Oh, that's good.
[03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:30.659]  That's good.
[03:06:31.040 --> 03:06:34.600]  Literally not allowed to say the word Christmas on the streets of London.
[03:06:34.819 --> 03:06:38.920]  Christmas canceled as woke mob bans X-mas from so-called winter market.
[03:06:39.059 --> 03:06:40.739]  Even X-mas I'm a little suspicious of.
[03:06:40.860 --> 03:06:41.719]  Spell the word, folks.
[03:06:42.590 --> 03:06:43.829]  It's Christmas, not Xmas.
[03:06:44.250 --> 03:06:45.329]  Show some respect.
[03:06:45.569 --> 03:06:48.629]  It just is baffling and bizarre.
[03:06:48.889 --> 03:06:51.090]  Look, who are they doing this for?
[03:06:51.530 --> 03:06:55.680]  Whoever is offended by Christmas Can leave.
[03:06:56.200 --> 03:07:03.379]  I literally can't imagine going to a Muslim country and being offended they're celebrating Muslim holidays.
[03:07:04.180 --> 03:07:05.280]  It's absurd.
[03:07:05.459 --> 03:07:13.100]  Anybody who demands that you stop celebrating your holidays because it offends them is a bad person that needs to go away.
[03:07:13.219 --> 03:07:14.979]  You're supposed to show respect for the country.
[03:07:15.690 --> 03:07:16.309]  That you're in.
[03:07:16.469 --> 03:07:20.549]  And it's absurd that you would allow somebody else to force you into this.
[03:07:20.649 --> 03:07:24.950]  It's even more absurd that it doesn't seem like anybody's forcing the Brits to do this.
[03:07:25.090 --> 03:07:26.329]  They're just doing it themselves.
[03:07:27.129 --> 03:07:29.469]  Utterly cucked, as we say.
[03:07:31.350 --> 03:07:33.229]  Yeah, it's a war on Christmas, folks.
[03:07:33.370 --> 03:07:35.450]  It turns out the war on Christmas is real.
[03:07:35.969 --> 03:07:39.250]  And, well, we've just begun to fight.
[03:07:39.610 --> 03:07:44.989]  So we're going to retake Christmas for ourselves and our children.
[03:07:45.780 --> 03:07:47.559]  With that, let's go out to some of your phone calls.
[03:07:47.719 --> 03:07:50.860]  It looks like Godzilla from Wisconsin is first through the gate.
[03:07:50.959 --> 03:07:52.120]  Godzilla, thanks for calling in.
[03:07:52.200 --> 03:07:52.579]  You're on the air.
[03:07:53.979 --> 03:07:54.739]  Merry Christmas.
[03:07:55.100 --> 03:07:57.440]  Merry Christmas, sir.
[03:07:58.479 --> 03:08:01.260]  Yeah, Christmas red pills and rabbit holes.
[03:08:01.479 --> 03:08:08.559]  I had to call in, and I think we're way past the point of red pilling.
[03:08:08.700 --> 03:08:10.799]  There's so many nowadays, like that video you made.
[03:08:11.329 --> 03:08:20.510]  There's just been, like, new ones, like the lasers, Ukrainian lasers, the UFOs, UAPs, whatever, and all the possible ones that Jones talks about.
[03:08:20.709 --> 03:08:28.350]  And, you know, I think at this point, most are under some sort of demonic parasite or parasite on their, like, astral soul self.
[03:08:28.909 --> 03:08:30.809]  So maybe from, like, a spiritual level.
[03:08:31.610 --> 03:08:34.430]  I mean, if you're not awake by now, what is it going to take?
[03:08:34.729 --> 03:08:35.329]  I know.
[03:08:36.250 --> 03:08:46.090]  But I've thought that for a while, Godzilla, and still we get callers like every day who's like, hey, you know, I was pretty blue-pilled until like about six months ago when I started listening to y'all.
[03:08:46.129 --> 03:08:47.489]  So never give up.
[03:08:47.489 --> 03:08:47.930]  I know.
[03:08:48.069 --> 03:08:55.750]  It seems crazy to me that there are people that still haven't gotten it and still don't understand what's going on.
[03:08:55.829 --> 03:08:59.239]  But Some people just need, they haven't heard it in the right way.
[03:08:59.340 --> 03:09:12.100]  They haven't heard the right message and are still, you know, trusting the media and thinking that the billionaires in Davos having secret meetings in Swiss chateaus are on our side and just love us and love the earth and are trying to save the earth.
[03:09:12.180 --> 03:09:13.579]  People are still buying that crap.
[03:09:13.579 --> 03:09:17.739]  So we gotta wake them up and I still think it's totally possible.
[03:09:18.309 --> 03:09:21.709]  So yeah, I mean, don't you think this is a unique opportunity, Godzilla?
[03:09:21.850 --> 03:09:31.010]  Don't you think that with the world in flux the way it is, there's an opening here where we can swoop in and help to elucidate what all of this chaos is about?
[03:09:32.809 --> 03:09:35.750]  Yeah, you know, it's a good time for conquering because they're so weak.
[03:09:35.850 --> 03:09:37.190]  What they're selling, nobody wants.
[03:09:37.489 --> 03:09:42.510]  You know, it's like, you saw the latest Kardashian video, like, Santa baby!
[03:09:42.829 --> 03:09:44.209]  It's like Satan demonic stuff.
[03:09:47.120 --> 03:09:48.520]  Yeah.
[03:10:27.090 --> 03:10:29.889]  Yes, sir.
[03:10:31.010 --> 03:10:32.950]  Tell them to be as Jesus as they can be.
[03:10:33.290 --> 03:10:40.989]  They've been given a gift of divinity, which just simply means the ability to transcend perceived limitations.
[03:10:41.590 --> 03:10:52.229]  And if we don't try to out-miracle Jesus, but create small miracles as often as you can and for absolutely no reason, we'll get our golden age, man.
[03:10:52.809 --> 03:10:53.409]  Amen.
[03:10:53.870 --> 03:10:54.870]  How do we do that?
[03:10:56.450 --> 03:11:03.930]  Just, you know, walk as if you are Jesus, you know, just be kind, love, compassion, empathy, you know?
[03:11:04.569 --> 03:11:04.709]  Yeah.
[03:11:06.049 --> 03:11:16.989]  And you know what, man, that's so key that you said that, empathy and understanding, because at the end of the day, you've got to understand that they're being tricked, they're genuine in their beliefs.
[03:11:17.170 --> 03:11:30.250]  You know, for the mainstream media, for the politicians, they're liars, they're just lying to everybody, but For your average person, for your cousins or aunts and uncles that are still blue-pilled, the place they're coming from is one that you can empathize with.
[03:11:30.370 --> 03:11:31.389]  They hate oppression.
[03:11:31.389 --> 03:11:34.430]  They just think that oppression comes from white people or something, right?
[03:11:34.510 --> 03:11:35.649]  They're just misaligned.
[03:11:35.829 --> 03:11:37.709]  They're aiming at the wrong target.
[03:11:37.770 --> 03:11:41.510]  But at the end of the day, we all sort of want the same thing, I would think.
[03:11:41.569 --> 03:11:44.530]  Unless you're actually evil, and there's not a lot of actually evil people out there.
[03:11:44.729 --> 03:11:47.629]  There's a lot of really good people with really good...
[03:11:49.800 --> 03:11:57.139]  Desires to fulfill good things, but they're being misled, they're being tricked, they're being led down a false path.
[03:11:57.479 --> 03:12:05.200]  And so really by empathizing with them and finding somewhere to come together, you know, hopefully you can correct their wild ways.
[03:12:05.440 --> 03:12:06.319]  You see what I'm saying, Jake?
[03:12:07.040 --> 03:12:13.700]  Yeah, so I grokked Alex Jones's spiritual and numerological meaning.
[03:12:14.569 --> 03:12:22.370]  And it describes him as a lot of things, but they were all so accurate, but one of them was as a camel, the symbol of endurance, navigating the deserts of life.
[03:12:22.649 --> 03:12:30.989]  So give yourself a gift and check out your spiritual and numerological evaluation of your name, and you will be astonished.
[03:12:31.549 --> 03:12:32.469]  Very interesting.
[03:12:33.129 --> 03:12:35.010]  Very interesting, and yet...
[03:12:35.950 --> 03:12:42.409]  The metaphor doesn't quite work because so far we have not found the straw that will break the camel's back in terms of Alex Jones.
[03:12:42.590 --> 03:12:48.590]  They've piled metric ton upon metric ton on this camel's back and yet we march on.
[03:12:48.889 --> 03:12:52.649]  And of course it's thanks to you going to thealexjonesstore.com and keeping us on the air.
[03:12:52.770 --> 03:12:53.930]  Thanks so much for the call, Jake.
[03:12:53.950 --> 03:12:55.469]  Let's go to Freddie in Georgia now.
[03:12:55.750 --> 03:12:58.030]  Freddie in Georgia, thanks so much for calling in.
[03:12:58.149 --> 03:13:00.569]  You're on the air about red pilling on this Christmas break.
[03:13:01.549 --> 03:13:02.950]  Well, I agree with that.
[03:13:03.209 --> 03:13:07.170]  You know, they've been They started off in the colleges, and now they're in the grammar schools.
[03:13:08.729 --> 03:13:18.350]  But I didn't want someone to talk about the red pill, but I just want to say thank you, because I've been watching your show for over seven-plus years.
[03:13:19.889 --> 03:13:24.750]  And I've learned a lot from what y'all have said.
[03:13:25.590 --> 03:13:33.510]  And people used to call me conspiracy theories, but a few years after they started that, They apologize because a lot of what I told them came true.
[03:13:33.709 --> 03:13:35.069]  And I learned that from y'all.
[03:13:36.030 --> 03:13:37.610]  And that isn't that interesting.
[03:13:37.770 --> 03:13:39.750]  And I mean, that really goes to the heart of it, right?
[03:13:40.129 --> 03:13:42.389]  Who is calling us conspiracy theorists anymore?
[03:13:42.549 --> 03:13:43.889]  We're literally just selling...
[03:13:43.889 --> 03:13:44.969]  I mean, it's not even us.
[03:13:45.129 --> 03:13:46.569]  They're telling you what they're doing, right?
[03:13:46.670 --> 03:13:48.090]  The mainstream media reports on it now.
[03:13:48.209 --> 03:13:51.690]  The mainstream media is admitting that deep state exists and all this stuff.
[03:13:51.829 --> 03:13:53.350]  So it's not even like...
[03:13:53.970 --> 03:13:55.489]  We are suddenly being believed.
[03:13:55.790 --> 03:13:59.129]  It's that the mainstream media is finally admitting what we've been telling you the whole time.
[03:13:59.309 --> 03:14:01.250]  So what do they say now?
[03:14:01.329 --> 03:14:03.209]  They're not calling you a conspiracy theorist anymore, are they?
[03:14:04.170 --> 03:14:18.030]  No, I mean, I'd say every one of them that ever called me that actually apologized, you know, because, like I said, they told me, a lot of what you said is now, you know, it's coming out.
[03:14:18.309 --> 03:14:19.569]  You was telling the truth, you know?
[03:14:20.540 --> 03:14:21.840]  But I had a great...
[03:14:21.840 --> 03:14:23.860]  Before I forget, because I got a bad memory.
[03:14:23.979 --> 03:14:24.200]  Go ahead.
[03:14:24.459 --> 03:14:28.819]  Before I forget, I got a great ideal for a t-shirt for y'all to put out.
[03:14:29.120 --> 03:14:29.639]  All right.
[03:14:30.600 --> 03:14:31.159]  All right.
[03:14:31.239 --> 03:14:43.379]  On the top of it, you put InfoWars support, put a picture of Trump, and then on the left side of him, put four, and on the other side, put 47. Four, 47?
[03:14:43.659 --> 03:14:44.620]  45 and 47?
[03:14:46.420 --> 03:14:48.579]  Well, he's 47 now, but...
[03:14:48.649 --> 03:14:52.809]  You know, that way it won't mess with people's, you know, some people ain't too bright.
[03:14:53.010 --> 03:14:58.670]  So just put, you know, 47. We gotta stick with the lowest common denominator here to get this message out.
[03:14:58.950 --> 03:15:01.489]  Thank you very much for the call, Freddie.
[03:15:01.790 --> 03:15:05.629]  You know, I'd be surprised if there wasn't one of those shirt designs already on the AlexJonesStore.com.
[03:15:05.750 --> 03:15:06.629]  The AlexJonesStore.com.
[03:15:26.020 --> 03:15:31.059]  I signed up myself.
[03:15:31.799 --> 03:15:34.639]  I signed up myself, thealexjonesstore.com slash Harrison.
[03:15:34.819 --> 03:15:46.260]  So I'm going to be doing the best I can to propagate that URL. But you can do it as well and make some money just from your support of Alex Jones and the Infowar.
[03:15:46.760 --> 03:15:48.040]  Thank you very much for that call.
[03:15:48.760 --> 03:15:49.940]  Let's go to one more call here.
[03:15:50.079 --> 03:15:54.200]  John in California, before we go to break, and I'll hold you over if we run out of time.
[03:15:54.319 --> 03:15:55.020]  John, you're on the air.
[03:15:55.120 --> 03:15:55.319]  Go ahead.
[03:15:56.329 --> 03:15:56.809]  Awesome!
[03:15:57.170 --> 03:16:01.229]  Harrison, my brother in Christ, and fantastic InfoWars audience.
[03:16:01.430 --> 03:16:13.909]  I want to address that question you asked specifically, how to red pill families specifically, not just people, because everybody, you know, having gone down that road, you know, from hammer to kindness, man, I've seen kind of everything in between.
[03:16:13.909 --> 03:16:24.469]  The way you red pill family is with actions and attitudes, and then you have to carefully present questions and responsibility that is our burden.
[03:16:25.309 --> 03:16:38.350]  is to be educated and informed enough to be able to answer those questions eloquently so as to not turn them off because often, let's be real, What we're facing is a spiritual sickness.
[03:16:39.090 --> 03:16:39.450]  100%.
[03:16:39.450 --> 03:16:40.549]  Hey, John, stay on the line.
[03:16:40.670 --> 03:16:42.129]  We're going to come back to you on the other side.
[03:16:42.250 --> 03:16:43.229]  This is The Alex Jones Show.
[03:16:43.370 --> 03:16:45.209]  We'll be back in just a few minutes, folks.
[03:16:45.329 --> 03:16:45.670]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:16:45.889 --> 03:16:57.250]  Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow patriots, it's December 2024, and that means it's Christmas at InfoWars, and our big present, President Trump, about to be in office in justice.
[03:16:57.420 --> 03:16:58.420]  A few weeks.
[03:16:58.579 --> 03:17:03.420]  Now, let me show you some of the amazing designs that are limited edition right now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:17:03.520 --> 03:17:04.440]  Talk about fun.
[03:17:04.600 --> 03:17:06.739]  Talk about a conversation piece.
[03:17:06.899 --> 03:17:11.739]  Talk about a way to trigger liberals and find fellow patriots on the street or at work at their Christmas party.
[03:17:11.959 --> 03:17:16.799]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the Alex Jones Rampant Christmas Sweater.
[03:17:17.079 --> 03:17:20.440]  And then, of course, there's the Darth Sidious Hoodies.
[03:17:20.899 --> 03:17:22.600]  Trump won, I'm afraid.
[03:17:23.450 --> 03:17:28.090]  Now, out of the hundreds of amazing designs, the Alex Jones Store.com, I knew this would be popular.
[03:17:28.209 --> 03:17:30.090]  It turns out it is one of the top five bestsellers.
[03:17:30.329 --> 03:17:33.469]  Trump, 2024. Better coverage than Verizon.
[03:17:33.750 --> 03:17:34.870]  Can you hear us now?
[03:17:35.069 --> 03:17:38.149]  And the Alex Jones Store.com has brought back a fan favorite.
[03:17:38.229 --> 03:17:40.309]  We haven't had this shirt for five, six, seven years.
[03:17:40.510 --> 03:17:43.870]  It's the classic InfoWars because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:17:44.110 --> 03:17:48.950]  And then we've got the alchemy of the deadly chemical accuracy bending our genders and the frogs' genders.
[03:17:49.190 --> 03:17:51.649]  The frogs go through the prism and they come out.
[03:17:51.750 --> 03:17:53.110]  Well, you know the rest of the story.
[03:17:53.450 --> 03:17:59.809]  And who can forget the chart that saved President Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania when he turned his head to the right wing of the chart?
[03:18:00.389 --> 03:18:01.510]  Everybody's got to get one of these.
[03:18:01.709 --> 03:18:02.989]  I predict it'll be a bestseller.
[03:18:03.250 --> 03:18:06.870]  Donald Trump reborn as a Jack Daniels bottle.
[03:18:07.090 --> 03:18:08.629]  This is going to be a bestseller as well.
[03:18:08.750 --> 03:18:10.850]  If you're blown away by these designs, it's just a few of them.
[03:18:11.030 --> 03:18:14.010]  There's over 200 designs right now at theaukshowstore.com.
[03:18:14.290 --> 03:18:15.930]  Get them, spread the word, and keep us on the air.
[03:18:16.110 --> 03:18:16.969]  God bless you all.
[03:18:16.969 --> 03:18:17.870]  Have a wonderful Christmas.
[03:18:20.379 --> 03:18:21.379]  Whoa ho ho!
[03:18:21.760 --> 03:18:23.100]  Merry Christmas!
[03:18:47.540 --> 03:18:49.319]  I do not like Christmas.
[03:18:50.129 --> 03:18:50.709]  No, I don't.
[03:18:51.129 --> 03:19:00.049]  And that's why every Christmas season, the Grinch shows up to give a nice little gift to the American people.
[03:19:00.409 --> 03:19:05.569]  Who do you think was responsible for pardoning all the spies and traitors?
[03:19:05.870 --> 03:19:12.209]  Whose idea do you think it was to commute the sentences of the murderers and the rapists?
[03:19:12.430 --> 03:19:14.489]  Why, it was I, the Grinch!
[03:19:15.500 --> 03:19:22.360]  There's all these rumors about who really won Washington, D.C. And I never get the credit for my dastardly deeds.
[03:19:22.940 --> 03:19:23.700]  But it is true.
[03:19:24.079 --> 03:19:25.700]  The Grinch is in charge.
[03:19:25.920 --> 03:19:27.799]  You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.
[03:19:27.979 --> 03:19:28.360]  Santa!
[03:19:28.540 --> 03:19:31.200]  That's not what the Christmas spirit is all about.
[03:19:31.559 --> 03:19:36.799]  It's about loving and giving and joy to the world and the birth of Jesus.
[03:19:37.120 --> 03:19:38.239]  Don't you understand?
[03:19:38.840 --> 03:19:40.280]  Oh, Santa!
[03:19:40.659 --> 03:19:42.239]  I've had a change of heart.
[03:19:42.500 --> 03:19:43.760]  That's more like it.
[03:19:43.959 --> 03:19:46.120]  In fact, I've got a gift for you.
[03:19:47.219 --> 03:19:47.780]  Nutcracker!
[03:19:48.280 --> 03:19:48.840]  Oh!
[03:19:49.500 --> 03:19:50.459]  Ha ha ha!
[03:19:50.459 --> 03:19:50.860]  Ha ha ha!
[03:19:54.260 --> 03:19:59.260]  And that, children, is why you never mess with the Grinch.
[03:20:01.120 --> 03:20:03.860]  This Christmas, go see the Nutcracker!
[03:20:08.860 --> 03:20:10.420]  Don't listen to the Grinch.
[03:20:10.600 --> 03:20:11.680]  He doesn't know what he's talking about.
[03:20:11.680 --> 03:20:12.920]  How about I ring your bell?
[03:20:15.079 --> 03:20:16.500]  You're foul, Grinch!
[03:20:16.620 --> 03:20:17.139]  Foul!
[03:20:17.620 --> 03:20:18.139]  Foul!
[03:20:18.579 --> 03:20:20.620]  I hear you travel around the world on Christmas.
[03:20:20.799 --> 03:20:21.920]  So let's start with...
[03:20:23.959 --> 03:20:25.000]  Maybe Saudi Arabia.
[03:20:25.819 --> 03:20:26.459]  Huh?
[03:20:26.719 --> 03:20:28.319]  How about those spoiled kids in America?
[03:20:29.579 --> 03:20:32.020]  We'll even go to the Brazilian Amazon rainforest!
[03:20:32.559 --> 03:20:34.040]  That's right, we're not done yet.
[03:20:34.239 --> 03:20:35.280]  The Sahara doesn't!
[03:20:35.659 --> 03:20:37.059]  You're ruining Christmas!
[03:20:39.120 --> 03:20:41.659]  Santa doesn't go down under.
[03:20:52.930 --> 03:20:55.370]  How about a refresher course in communism?
[03:20:58.290 --> 03:21:00.750]  And to all, a good night!
[03:21:05.530 --> 03:21:09.110]  So this Christmas, don't be like the Grinch.
[03:21:09.530 --> 03:21:11.569]  Merry Christmas, everyone!
[03:21:13.129 --> 03:21:15.270]  You got knocked the fuck out.
[03:21:18.790 --> 03:21:19.590]  Alright.
[03:21:20.409 --> 03:21:27.989]  A little Christmas gift from your friends at Infowars and the AlexJonesStore.com.
[03:21:28.329 --> 03:21:32.329]  Worthy of professional wrestling, I think.
[03:21:32.469 --> 03:21:37.409]  Some pretty incredible stunt work there from Owen Schroyer and Darren McBreen.
[03:21:38.559 --> 03:21:40.200]  Just a little fun on this Christmas Eve.
[03:21:40.319 --> 03:21:42.120]  You are watching The Alex Jones Show.
[03:21:42.280 --> 03:21:49.700]  I'm Harrison Smith, sitting in for Alex this final hour, taking your calls on how to red pill your friends and family.
[03:21:49.860 --> 03:21:54.280]  And we have some actual news to get to and some actual videos to show you that are of...
[03:22:15.049 --> 03:22:16.729]  Thank you Harrison.
[03:22:17.329 --> 03:22:18.090]  Yes sir, absolutely.
[03:22:18.469 --> 03:22:26.739]  The gem of wisdom that can be transferred to this question is You can't teach anybody anything that they themselves aren't willing to learn.
[03:22:26.920 --> 03:22:39.120]  So the art of arriving at that place with a potential, you know, listener for somebody in your family, it really does boil down to unfortunately tried and true, you know, failures and successes.
[03:22:39.340 --> 03:22:43.920]  And mine I will share with you all out there is actions and attitudes.
[03:22:44.180 --> 03:22:56.809]  And the same can be said with leading people to Christ because it really is that spiritual illness Where only the supernatural power of Christ can change the heart of a man from stone to flesh.
[03:22:57.329 --> 03:23:07.030]  The same infection is what keeps people blinded to those very basic truths that we share with them.
[03:23:07.370 --> 03:23:20.040]  The trick is not overwhelming them intellectually, you know, because you may Not everybody, frankly, is operating on the same intellectual level, but everybody understands actions.
[03:23:20.659 --> 03:23:22.200]  Everybody understands attitudes.
[03:23:22.520 --> 03:23:27.040]  And even deeper, everybody understands blood, which is what unites us through Christ.
[03:23:27.239 --> 03:23:29.540]  So with that, Merry Christmas to you all.
[03:23:29.680 --> 03:23:31.780]  It's been a privilege and an honor to speak to you, Harrison.
[03:23:32.280 --> 03:23:33.219]  God bless you guys.
[03:23:33.500 --> 03:23:35.280]  Everything you're doing, keep it up.
[03:23:35.340 --> 03:23:37.020]  Keep it up out there in the audience.
[03:23:37.819 --> 03:23:39.479]  Everything you're doing matters, folks.
[03:23:40.200 --> 03:23:41.620]  God bless you as well.
[03:23:41.799 --> 03:23:42.540]  I love it, John.
[03:23:42.719 --> 03:23:44.739]  I think you're exactly right in everything that you said.
[03:23:44.840 --> 03:23:45.440]  Very well put.
[03:23:45.600 --> 03:23:46.479]  I love the crew.
[03:23:46.659 --> 03:23:53.879]  If you're a radio viewer, the crew, the whole time people are talking, they're putting up articles that are the opposite of what we're talking about.
[03:23:54.020 --> 03:24:07.360]  All of the very concerned and intellectual articles from the ADL and mainstream media about how to deal with your MAGA dad or how to confront your conspiracy theorist friends and family.
[03:24:07.520 --> 03:24:08.620]  How to help them.
[03:24:09.139 --> 03:24:10.780]  They need help, don't they?
[03:24:11.139 --> 03:24:11.340]  Why?
[03:24:11.440 --> 03:24:16.840]  Because we read the information that you people put out and actually think about it for a little bit?
[03:24:17.340 --> 03:24:18.819]  Yeah, we don't need your help.
[03:24:18.940 --> 03:24:21.299]  You need ours, and we're happy to give it to you.
[03:24:21.559 --> 03:24:27.520]  And I think at the end of the day, it's about recognizing that we all share concerns.
[03:24:27.520 --> 03:24:28.379]  Some people are just...
[03:24:29.250 --> 03:24:33.430]  Sort of led down the wrong path, but they hate oppression.
[03:24:33.670 --> 03:24:34.790]  Who doesn't hate oppression?
[03:24:34.930 --> 03:24:35.950]  Who doesn't hate war?
[03:24:36.209 --> 03:24:39.290]  Who actually likes the stuff that they're promoting?
[03:24:39.530 --> 03:24:52.950]  Now, when it comes to things like climate change, you might have a bit more of a A bit more of a struggle, but there are endless examples of just complete scams that are predicated on the climate change agenda.
[03:24:53.090 --> 03:24:56.750]  And it would be another place that I would think you could at least start on the same foot.
[03:24:56.909 --> 03:25:01.049]  You could at least both agree, like, we both like the earth, right?
[03:25:01.090 --> 03:25:01.909]  We both like nature.
[03:25:02.069 --> 03:25:07.270]  We both want there to be verdant, green, you know, life everywhere.
[03:25:07.270 --> 03:25:08.610]  I mean, we both agree on that, right?
[03:25:08.829 --> 03:25:11.079]  Well, Here's what I think we should do.
[03:25:11.200 --> 03:25:12.500]  Here's what the globalists are doing.
[03:25:12.659 --> 03:25:27.260]  Here's how they're cutting down old growth forests in British Columbia, chopping the trees into pellets, shipping those pellets overseas, and burning them for fuel instead of coal, and then calling it zero emission, because that's what a big scam this all is.
[03:25:27.340 --> 03:25:30.219]  So it's not that we hate the earth, because that's what's always projected.
[03:25:30.319 --> 03:25:31.479]  It's always projected as like...
[03:25:32.770 --> 03:25:36.309]  Republicans and MAGA people, they just want grandma to die.
[03:25:36.450 --> 03:25:39.770]  We want grandmothers to die, which is why we don't want to wear masks.
[03:25:39.950 --> 03:25:55.030]  The projection that they display for everybody of their image, their straw man of Republicans, is so outrageous that really your first response is usually offense and outrage, and that's just how you start off on the wrong foot.
[03:25:55.209 --> 03:26:00.149]  Find something you can start off on the right foot on, and then lead them down the path towards truth and revelation.
[03:26:00.930 --> 03:26:10.989]  We're good to go.
[03:26:17.829 --> 03:26:21.569]  What the globalists are gonna do, why you were right when everybody else was wrong.
[03:26:21.790 --> 03:26:37.129]  And for me, that's because you start off with the assumption that the mainstream media is lying, and they're lying in pursuit of a goal of global governments, of combining all the world's religions, combining all the world's states, getting rid of national borders,
[03:26:37.270 --> 03:26:47.370]  having supranational, unelected bodies who can dictate to us our entire lives, controlling us through surveillance, censorship, and a variety of other oppressive activities.
[03:26:47.629 --> 03:26:55.290]  So, it's like, it's not enough just to understand that we were right about COVID, right about the lab leak, right about the vaccines.
[03:26:55.469 --> 03:27:07.590]  The reason we were right is because we understand the overarching goal of globalism, of this anti-dehumanization program, anti-human dehumanization program that they're engaged in.
[03:27:07.750 --> 03:27:09.610]  That's what informs globalism.
[03:27:11.840 --> 03:27:21.940]  We're good to go.
[03:27:27.549 --> 03:27:31.850]  They actually think that they're doing that because they love you and want what's best for you.
[03:27:31.909 --> 03:27:32.889]  And that is absurd to me.
[03:27:33.049 --> 03:27:38.569]  It makes a lot more sense that they're engaged in a giant open conspiracy to enslave the planet.
[03:27:38.569 --> 03:27:41.170]  And it turns out if you take that assumption, you're going to be right.
[03:27:41.170 --> 03:27:44.069]  You're going to be right a hell of a lot more often than you're going to be wrong.
[03:27:44.750 --> 03:27:45.709]  More calls now.
[03:27:45.829 --> 03:27:49.569]  Let's go to Jessica in California on line number two.
[03:27:49.709 --> 03:27:50.250]  Go ahead, Jessica.
[03:27:50.389 --> 03:27:50.750]  You're on the air.
[03:27:51.770 --> 03:27:52.670]  Hey, O'Harrison.
[03:27:53.010 --> 03:27:53.229]  Hello.
[03:27:54.389 --> 03:27:54.770]  Hey.
[03:27:55.289 --> 03:28:01.270]  So, something that you said like a month ago, and this is crazy because you're talking about all of this stuff right now.
[03:28:01.569 --> 03:28:05.329]  I was listening to Alex when I went to go grocery shopping, and now I'm back and you're on.
[03:28:05.670 --> 03:28:12.250]  So, my son was born in 92, and he's completely gone the other way.
[03:28:12.250 --> 03:28:22.610]  And you were saying how you would love to talk to an intellectual that would listen, and you always have such, you're so much better at getting things out than me.
[03:28:22.889 --> 03:28:28.549]  I've got kids, they were never vaxxed, like no childhood vaccination, and he's completely left.
[03:28:29.309 --> 03:28:31.049]  He loves the smart cities.
[03:28:32.129 --> 03:28:33.229]  He thinks it's great.
[03:28:33.450 --> 03:28:37.430]  He repurposes wood, so he's on the right track.
[03:28:37.909 --> 03:28:41.829]  But I think you and I would have been friends in high school.
[03:28:41.950 --> 03:28:44.129]  I'm way older, but I think you and I would have been buddies.
[03:28:45.180 --> 03:28:46.280]  I hope so.
[03:28:46.559 --> 03:28:49.100]  I probably would have been buddies with your son, too.
[03:28:49.799 --> 03:28:53.360]  All my friends were liberal growing up.
[03:28:54.360 --> 03:28:58.360]  But if you're repurposing wood, there's nothing wrong with that.
[03:28:58.440 --> 03:29:09.860]  And look, there's nothing even wrong with wanting to take advantage of the technology that we have and the lure of smart cities and these ideas are very seductive and they seem cool.
[03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:17.930]  And the obvious response to people who love that stuff is like, Yeah, obviously evil has to package itself in an attractive package.
[03:29:17.930 --> 03:29:19.270]  It always does.
[03:29:19.690 --> 03:29:26.270]  Nobody's going to fall for the scammer that's wearing a scammer sign on their forehead, you know, that's like huddled up with a big trench coat.
[03:29:26.409 --> 03:29:27.950]  Like, they have to present themselves.
[03:29:28.190 --> 03:29:31.809]  Evil always, 100% of the time, presents itself as not evil.
[03:29:31.989 --> 03:29:32.950]  That's how it commits evil.
[03:29:32.950 --> 03:29:33.790]  It's, like, necessary.
[03:29:33.950 --> 03:29:38.149]  It's contingent on them being able to achieve anything.
[03:29:38.329 --> 03:29:38.549]  So...
[03:29:39.710 --> 03:29:44.969]  I hope you're able to break through and lead your son back to the light.
[03:29:45.170 --> 03:29:47.549]  I'm sorry to hear that he's fallen by the wayside.
[03:29:48.549 --> 03:29:50.649]  I would love you to talk to him when you do that.
[03:29:51.040 --> 03:29:51.840]  I'd love to.
[03:29:52.059 --> 03:29:52.799]  I'd love to.
[03:29:53.520 --> 03:29:54.319]  You're serious.
[03:29:54.520 --> 03:29:59.940]  Like, that would be amazing, because you're so much more eloquent than me, and I'm his mom, and you know.
[03:30:00.420 --> 03:30:07.340]  Well, that's the unfortunate problem is, you know, people don't want to listen to their moms.
[03:30:07.379 --> 03:30:09.260]  It never goes away, unfortunately.
[03:30:10.120 --> 03:30:14.879]  But yeah, you know, I'd love to, because again, I think we can agree on a lot of this stuff.
[03:30:15.040 --> 03:30:16.440]  It reminds me, I had a debate with...
[03:30:17.709 --> 03:30:23.030]  Destiny, the live streamer, a couple years ago, and it was about globalism, and he literally didn't even understand what it was.
[03:30:23.129 --> 03:30:43.309]  He had no idea, and I was explaining to him about things like Davos, going, look, there's these billionaires, they come together, industrial elites, the media magnates, the royal family, they meet in secret, they plan the schedule for the next year or however long, and then they come out and the next year they check back in and see where everything's gone.
[03:30:43.790 --> 03:30:45.430]  And he's just like, well, I just don't believe you.
[03:30:45.530 --> 03:30:47.920]  And it's like, Well, that's not an option.
[03:30:48.100 --> 03:30:49.639]  I mean, this is what happens.
[03:30:49.780 --> 03:30:52.200]  I'm not arguing with you.
[03:30:52.360 --> 03:30:53.920]  This isn't a difference of opinions.
[03:30:54.100 --> 03:30:57.399]  I'm just telling you what happens, and you're just saying you don't believe me.
[03:30:57.559 --> 03:30:59.479]  So, okay, I guess.
[03:30:59.579 --> 03:31:02.500]  You can just not believe a reality, but it is reality.
[03:31:02.639 --> 03:31:05.959]  And I feel like that's where a lot of these leftists are.
[03:31:06.459 --> 03:31:07.479]  They just don't know.
[03:31:07.620 --> 03:31:08.520]  They just have no idea.
[03:31:09.399 --> 03:31:10.420]  And it's one of the things.
[03:31:10.500 --> 03:31:15.700]  If you are listening to this broadcast, you're in the top 1% of 1% of awake people.
[03:31:15.819 --> 03:31:18.329]  And I'm not just trying to, like, You know, blow smoke.
[03:31:18.450 --> 03:31:19.889]  I'm not just trying to pump you up here.
[03:31:20.670 --> 03:31:22.350]  Just, you can do it yourself.
[03:31:22.510 --> 03:31:26.969]  Go out in the mall at Christmas Eve today and just ask random people, do you know who Klaus Schwab is?
[03:31:27.090 --> 03:31:32.350]  Do you think 99% of them are going to say, oh yeah, Klaus Schwab, he's the head of the World Economic Forum.
[03:31:32.350 --> 03:31:35.270]  He was Henry Kissinger's understudy at Harvard.
[03:31:35.299 --> 03:31:37.280]  Are they going to know all of that?
[03:31:37.440 --> 03:31:38.200]  Probably not.
[03:31:38.360 --> 03:31:46.280]  So if you know who Klaus Schwab is or what the World Economic Forum even is, you are more informed than 99% of people out there.
[03:31:46.459 --> 03:31:48.360]  And so they don't know.
[03:31:48.360 --> 03:31:58.200]  So when you're talking about billionaires getting together on the top of a mountain under the cloak of darkness to plot world events, they think you sound crazy, but it's all on video.
[03:31:58.200 --> 03:31:59.959]  They live stream it at this point.
[03:31:59.979 --> 03:32:01.120]  So you really can't...
[03:32:01.840 --> 03:32:03.399]  You really can't just ignore this.
[03:32:03.559 --> 03:32:06.440]  I mean, you can choose ignorance, but who would want to do that?
[03:32:06.959 --> 03:32:08.620]  Thank you so much for the call, Jessica.
[03:32:09.100 --> 03:32:10.059]  Just DM me on Twitter.
[03:32:10.200 --> 03:32:16.420]  Follow me on Twitter at Harrison H. Smith and DM me and just say you're Jessica who called in and you want me to talk to your son.
[03:32:16.440 --> 03:32:18.139]  I would be happy to.
[03:32:18.239 --> 03:32:19.440]  We'll have to air it.
[03:32:19.520 --> 03:32:29.209]  We'll have to make it maybe a special broadcast where we bring on normie liberals and try to Try to figure out what's going on in their brains because it's fascinating.
[03:32:29.870 --> 03:32:31.729]  Let's go to Cohen in Oregon.
[03:32:31.750 --> 03:32:33.450]  Cohen, you're on the air about the red pill.
[03:32:34.670 --> 03:32:35.049]  All right.
[03:32:35.250 --> 03:32:42.590]  Well, first of all, your previous caller was an excellent caller that talked about connecting with them through your actions and leading by example.
[03:32:42.809 --> 03:32:42.969]  Yep.
[03:32:44.389 --> 03:32:54.379]  I would truly believe in that for the younger generations, but with the older generations, Like, you know, people in their 40s that are dead set in their ways already.
[03:32:55.440 --> 03:32:57.840]  You know, in my family, I use economics.
[03:32:59.000 --> 03:33:07.540]  And if you're going to go back to the problems with the globalists, with economics, it all starts in 1913, where Bill Wilson signed in the Federal Reserve Act.
[03:33:08.020 --> 03:33:15.459]  Well, these days, that argument is very much more simplified if you use artificial intelligence to argue with you, for you.
[03:33:16.379 --> 03:33:25.219]  And the way that I do that is simply ask it, what would a dollar be worth today had the 1913 Act not taken away the gold standard?
[03:33:25.500 --> 03:33:26.979]  And the answer is $90.
[03:33:27.680 --> 03:33:28.239]  Wow.
[03:33:29.020 --> 03:33:30.459]  That's very interesting.
[03:33:30.620 --> 03:33:35.319]  So if you had $90 extra per dollar, that is a compelling argument for anyone.
[03:33:35.319 --> 03:33:37.319]  I don't care what side of the aisle you're on.
[03:33:38.899 --> 03:33:41.500]  And then you could go into some other stuff.
[03:33:42.319 --> 03:33:58.500]  About lowering the interest rates and maybe even ending the Federal Reserve, which could be done under the trifecta of power that we have right now, which wouldn't be that difficult if we could get everybody to agree that a gold standard or something similar,
[03:33:58.760 --> 03:34:02.020]  maybe even a Bitcoin standard or whatever, could be agreed upon.
[03:34:03.100 --> 03:34:06.440]  But it could be done currently underneath the Trump presidency.
[03:34:06.459 --> 03:34:09.059]  We could abolish the Fed.
[03:34:09.940 --> 03:34:11.000]  Wouldn't that be something?
[03:34:11.780 --> 03:34:21.659]  Of course, the danger of that would be the introduction of a central bank digital currency, which we have to be very aware of and cautious against.
[03:34:22.079 --> 03:34:24.159]  I would prefer a gold standard.
[03:34:24.340 --> 03:34:27.340]  I just don't want to be drawn into the digital ID matrix.
[03:34:28.020 --> 03:34:37.680]  But yeah, economy is a great place that I think people can come together since everybody really is suffering under inflation and are being fed just a litany of lies to explain.
[03:34:44.500 --> 03:34:59.940]  We're good to go.
[03:35:00.510 --> 03:35:03.010]  By Sean Miller, again Infowars.com.
[03:35:03.149 --> 03:35:24.209]  On Tuesday morning, the social media site X saw the term digital ID trend as users rebuked a propaganda piece from the UK, Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, which depicted a young adult who uses a traditional ID card at a pub as clumsy and backwards, followed by a well-kept man promoting the new UK digital ID via smartphone app as the sleek future for age verification.
[03:35:24.590 --> 03:35:27.549]  And it's just one of these things that you just have to ask yourself...
[03:35:28.420 --> 03:35:32.319]  Is the reason that they're giving sufficient to explain this change?
[03:35:32.600 --> 03:35:33.979]  And the answer is obviously no.
[03:35:34.100 --> 03:35:41.020]  I think back to the smart meters, where it's like, oh yeah, we're going to replace your old gas meter with this, or electric meter with this new smart meter.
[03:35:41.020 --> 03:35:44.059]  It's got all of these different abilities that it can do.
[03:35:44.420 --> 03:35:46.340]  And it's like, well, what's the problem they're solving?
[03:35:46.579 --> 03:35:47.360]  You know, there isn't one.
[03:35:47.530 --> 03:35:50.510]  What benefit is there other than surveillance and control?
[03:35:50.829 --> 03:35:51.770]  Well, there isn't one.
[03:35:52.030 --> 03:35:53.989]  So why are they really doing it?
[03:35:54.090 --> 03:35:56.809]  For an ulterior motive, obviously has to be the conclusion.
[03:35:57.049 --> 03:36:04.510]  So in this case, Department of Science, Innovation and Technology posts this video with the title, Ordering a pint under 25 can be hard.
[03:36:04.649 --> 03:36:06.690]  Searching your wallet to find your ID card.
[03:36:06.870 --> 03:36:16.110]  I mean, I hadn't seen this video yet that we're playing on screen for you, but it's exactly what I would expect because I was imagining the classic sort of like...
[03:36:17.110 --> 03:36:17.709]  What's the term?
[03:36:17.809 --> 03:36:29.530]  The infomercial style thing where it's like, have you ever tried to pour a glass of juice and there's just juice going everywhere and they're spilling it and the dog is eating the glass and it's just like, oh god, this is so hard.
[03:36:29.670 --> 03:36:31.270]  It's like, no, this isn't a problem.
[03:36:31.649 --> 03:36:39.290]  Getting your ID out to prove your age has been the successful method of age verification for as long as age verification has been a thing.
[03:36:39.290 --> 03:36:40.389]  So it's not a problem.
[03:36:40.389 --> 03:36:41.309]  It's not an issue.
[03:36:41.510 --> 03:36:43.590]  It's not some, you know...
[03:36:43.959 --> 03:36:47.799]  Something that has collapsed recently and we have to come up with some new system for it.
[03:36:48.020 --> 03:36:51.799]  No, you get your card out, you show it to them, there you go, verified, done.
[03:36:51.920 --> 03:36:52.479]  It's easy.
[03:36:52.579 --> 03:36:53.739]  There's no problem with this.
[03:36:53.819 --> 03:36:58.100]  So why are they trying to introduce digital ID? For all of the reasons they're not giving.
[03:36:58.280 --> 03:37:01.360]  It's not so you can get a pint at the pub on the corner.
[03:37:01.399 --> 03:37:12.959]  It's so that you are now entered into the matrix where, you know, combined with things like contact tracing that they lured us into through COVID, you will be tracked and traced and monitored continuously.
[03:37:13.760 --> 03:37:26.540]  This is the obvious outcome, and it's good to see so many people rising up against this and recognizing immediately what an absurd solution to a non-existent problem this represents.
[03:37:26.540 --> 03:37:28.579]  Just be suspicious.
[03:37:29.239 --> 03:37:31.020]  Yeah, the big problem is...
[03:37:32.030 --> 03:37:35.729]  The under-18s buying cigarettes with their fake Hawaiian IDs.
[03:37:36.049 --> 03:37:36.450]  Yeah, right.
[03:37:36.790 --> 03:37:39.090]  Again, not a problem, so what are they trying to solve?
[03:37:39.290 --> 03:37:47.690]  Well, they're trying to solve the problem, as they see it, of you being a private citizen and not being under continual surveillance because you haven't committed a crime.
[03:37:48.350 --> 03:37:49.549]  That's my take anyway.
[03:37:50.530 --> 03:37:51.729]  So be warned.
[03:37:51.729 --> 03:37:52.809]  I agree about the...
[03:37:55.119 --> 03:37:57.520]  Absurdity of the fiat money system as it stands now.
[03:37:58.360 --> 03:38:02.020]  And look, not to ramble too much, I will go out to calls in just one more second, but...
[03:38:03.120 --> 03:38:08.680]  When you talk about this stuff with leftists, a lot of times they get hung up on the money stuff.
[03:38:08.840 --> 03:38:10.239]  They really think it's all about money.
[03:38:10.379 --> 03:38:17.819]  They really think that all of the problems in the world are because of greedy billionaires, greedy capitalists trying to make money, and that's the real issue.
[03:38:17.940 --> 03:38:19.700]  That's as far as their reasoning goes.
[03:38:20.020 --> 03:38:28.920]  Does that worldview not completely collapse when you know that the money that these people are using is fake and fake?
[03:38:29.870 --> 03:38:30.950]  Created out of thin air.
[03:38:31.110 --> 03:38:33.250]  Like, what do you mean they're doing it for money?
[03:38:33.370 --> 03:38:34.489]  They have all the money.
[03:38:34.750 --> 03:38:37.350]  They create money with a wave of their hands.
[03:38:37.510 --> 03:38:39.270]  So they're not doing anything for money.
[03:38:39.489 --> 03:38:40.969]  They use money as a tool.
[03:38:41.129 --> 03:38:42.729]  Money is the weapon that they deploy.
[03:38:42.909 --> 03:38:44.850]  Money is the method by which they gain control.
[03:38:45.069 --> 03:38:46.250]  That is their ultimate goal.
[03:38:46.370 --> 03:38:47.450]  It's not about money.
[03:38:47.569 --> 03:38:54.409]  So that's another thing that I'm sure people hear from their leftist family members these days is, oh, they're just, Elon Musk is just all about money.
[03:38:54.530 --> 03:39:05.479]  And it's like, We're good to go.
[03:39:12.639 --> 03:39:13.700]  They don't need any more money.
[03:39:13.799 --> 03:39:15.500]  They're not doing things for the sake of money.
[03:39:15.680 --> 03:39:18.840]  And I think that's an important point to make for people who are stuck in that mindset.
[03:39:19.040 --> 03:39:22.500]  It's like people that still think the Iraq war was over oil.
[03:39:22.639 --> 03:39:23.500]  It's like, really?
[03:39:23.799 --> 03:39:24.200]  Really?
[03:39:24.319 --> 03:39:25.079]  Is this the 90s?
[03:39:25.219 --> 03:39:28.700]  Are you stuck in this 20-year-old frame of mind?
[03:39:29.100 --> 03:39:31.719]  Understand, these people are diabolical idiots.
[03:39:33.300 --> 03:39:36.500]  They're beyond concerns of things like money.
[03:39:36.639 --> 03:39:38.139]  They're about power.
[03:39:38.280 --> 03:39:39.100]  They're about control.
[03:39:39.340 --> 03:39:40.200]  They're about domination.
[03:39:40.479 --> 03:39:52.559]  They're about living forever and setting up a world in which immortality can be dispensed by them as gods to the rest of us lowly mortals who will be forced to behave or not be given the immortality.
[03:39:52.680 --> 03:39:56.600]  That's what it's all about at the end of the day, and I hope people can understand that.
[03:39:56.899 --> 03:40:00.600]  Let's go to Digital Dave now in FEMA Region 6. Go ahead, Digital Dave.
[03:40:00.600 --> 03:40:01.180]  You're on the air.
[03:40:02.420 --> 03:40:03.860]  Merry Christmas, Harrison.
[03:40:04.100 --> 03:40:04.659]  Merry Christmas.
[03:40:05.020 --> 03:40:14.059]  Yours and Alex's and all the crew members, Lord, you guys are doing God's work, and we are so grateful out here in the trenches with you.
[03:40:14.840 --> 03:40:15.340]  Well, thank you.
[03:40:16.540 --> 03:40:17.420]  Thank you.
[03:40:17.639 --> 03:40:18.180]  Thank you.
[03:40:19.559 --> 03:40:27.940]  Father God, I just ask you that this anointed call with Harrison and the crew would go as you would have it to go, in Jesus' name.
[03:40:28.420 --> 03:40:28.579]  Amen.
[03:40:29.639 --> 03:40:31.860]  I do something a little bit different.
[03:40:31.979 --> 03:40:33.200]  We got a big family, okay?
[03:40:33.459 --> 03:40:34.059]  Huge family.
[03:40:34.479 --> 03:40:40.540]  Two marriages, concentrated bunch of kids, you know, large group of kids, and we even have a great-grand now.
[03:40:41.379 --> 03:40:44.319]  Oldest daughter had a baby.
[03:40:44.639 --> 03:40:44.959]  Beautiful.
[03:40:45.100 --> 03:40:45.420]  Congratulations.
[03:40:45.739 --> 03:40:46.520]  Granddaughter, I should say.
[03:40:46.639 --> 03:40:47.440]  Yeah, thank you.
[03:40:47.860 --> 03:40:52.739]  So, my take is that there is so much in place already.
[03:40:53.620 --> 03:40:55.100]  Oh, and by the way, Greg, get started.
[03:40:55.239 --> 03:40:59.459]  I won't be very long, but all your previous callers, what blessing.
[03:40:59.959 --> 03:41:01.620]  There's all such blessings.
[03:41:02.059 --> 03:41:19.040]  All the people who are understanding where we're at, and I wish them all the just safest, happiest lives, long and extended lives, because we are constantly moving, and the enemy can't keep us in his crosshairs.
[03:41:19.489 --> 03:41:24.290]  Thanks to the Holy Ghost and the love of Jesus and people like you and Alex.
[03:41:24.350 --> 03:41:26.090]  It is a beautiful thing, Digital Dave.
[03:41:26.409 --> 03:41:31.649]  Now, we only have about a minute left in the show today, so go ahead and give me what you're talking about.
[03:41:31.690 --> 03:41:32.209]  I'll get to my point.
[03:41:32.350 --> 03:41:32.549]  Please.
[03:41:32.690 --> 03:41:33.149]  Alright, okay.
[03:41:33.549 --> 03:41:34.969]  So, first we have to...
[03:41:34.969 --> 03:41:38.469]  I do it publicly more than with the kids and the family now.
[03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:39.750]  Walmart, wherever.
[03:41:40.469 --> 03:41:41.229]  We don't have a target.
[03:41:41.370 --> 03:41:41.809]  They took that.
[03:41:41.950 --> 03:41:42.909]  They're closing the world out.
[03:41:43.090 --> 03:41:44.870]  So I kind of announced stuff.
[03:41:45.049 --> 03:41:47.170]  Boy, I'll just say something to get up.
[03:41:47.430 --> 03:41:48.190]  You know, and I mean it.
[03:41:48.250 --> 03:41:48.870]  I'm sincere about it.
[03:41:48.950 --> 03:41:49.790]  Like, boy, isn't God great?
[03:41:49.989 --> 03:41:51.069]  Did you see the sky today?
[03:41:51.270 --> 03:41:51.409]  Yeah.
[03:41:51.770 --> 03:41:52.010]  Yeah.
[03:41:52.290 --> 03:41:54.930]  You know, I didn't see any aerosol injections out there.
[03:41:55.270 --> 03:42:03.010]  With those two comments right there, you're going to get feedback that's going to give you insight into what this person may or may not think about you.
[03:42:03.110 --> 03:42:03.850]  Just by expressing.
[03:42:03.870 --> 03:42:08.950]  And hopefully you can then, you know, sort of, you open the door with that and then lead them down the path.
[03:42:09.129 --> 03:42:10.370]  I'm sorry to have to cut you off.
[03:42:10.409 --> 03:42:14.770]  I wish I could take more calls, but we are going to have to end here in just about 10 seconds.
[03:42:14.950 --> 03:42:22.590]  I'm Harrison Smith, wishing you a Merry Christmas, and stay tuned because we've got great shows throughout the Christmas break, and God bless you all.
[03:42:22.770 --> 03:42:22.969]  Good night.
[03:42:24.129 --> 03:42:26.729]  Wish everyone an amazing, safe...
[03:42:29.359 --> 03:42:35.500]  Christmas, I would encourage people to pray and get closer to Christ, especially if you don't believe Christ is real.
[03:42:35.639 --> 03:42:38.059]  Why don't you reach out to God and ask God to show you?
[03:42:38.219 --> 03:42:41.340]  I think you'll be surprised what happens.
[03:42:41.680 --> 03:42:46.540]  Basically, everybody I know that actually reaches out with an honest heart to God and says, I don't know if you're real.
[03:42:46.700 --> 03:42:47.520]  I've been told you're not.
[03:42:47.600 --> 03:42:48.819]  But I see the evil in the world.
[03:42:48.819 --> 03:42:49.780]  I also see the good.
[03:42:49.860 --> 03:42:50.500]  Will you show me?
[03:42:50.659 --> 03:42:53.260]  And if you have a sincere heart, God will show you.
[03:42:53.340 --> 03:42:54.100]  You will be amazed.
[03:42:54.889 --> 03:42:59.909]  Might hit you like Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus right away, or it might happen a week from then.
[03:43:00.250 --> 03:43:01.950]  Depends on how sincere you are.
[03:43:02.250 --> 03:43:06.129]  So this Christmas, I want you to know I love you, no matter what color you are or where you came from.
[03:43:06.129 --> 03:43:09.729]  If you love God, you love justice, and you want to be free, I am your brother.
[03:43:10.250 --> 03:43:11.549]  I am your brethren.
[03:43:11.770 --> 03:43:15.450]  And I want to wish you for myself and the whole InfoWars crew a blessed Christmas.
[03:43:22.850 --> 03:43:23.989]  It's time to take action.
[03:43:24.329 --> 03:43:30.190]  So for a lot of you out there, this is free, and you can make supplemental money very easily.
[03:43:30.510 --> 03:43:33.649]  I mean, I would imagine most people can make hundreds of bucks a month with their eyes closed.
[03:43:33.850 --> 03:43:39.549]  And if you really kick ass, thousands of dollars, even if you have a tiny, you know, X account or Facebook or whatever.
[03:43:39.870 --> 03:43:43.290]  But if you're a talk show host, I mean, you can make...
[03:43:43.709 --> 03:43:48.250]  Of living and finance your show and maybe even, you know, hire reporters or whatever.
[03:43:48.389 --> 03:43:49.690]  I mean, this is exciting.
[03:43:49.909 --> 03:43:52.969]  So, go now to the AlexShowStore.com.
[03:43:53.129 --> 03:43:57.069]  And one other thing, there are five limited edition fundraiser posters.
[03:43:57.250 --> 03:43:59.010]  And by fundraiser, everything raises funds there.
[03:43:59.090 --> 03:44:02.709]  But the t-shirts cost like 16, 17 bucks a piece before you buy them.
[03:44:02.790 --> 03:44:07.829]  And then the sponsor gets half and we get half and to run all this and build a new network as a backup.
[03:44:08.170 --> 03:44:09.829]  You know, we're squeaking by.
[03:44:10.129 --> 03:44:16.850]  But when something says fundraiser on it, like a t-shirt that's cost double, or a poster, yeah, the poster costs five, six bucks.
[03:44:17.250 --> 03:44:20.709]  I mean, the shipping we ship it in, the special packaging costs as much as the poster itself.
[03:44:21.129 --> 03:44:27.110]  So we're, you know, six, seven, eight, nine bucks for the poster cost with the packaging, and then we're selling it for 25, 30 bucks.
[03:44:27.250 --> 03:44:29.030]  That's because there's some real markup in there to fund it.
[03:44:29.090 --> 03:44:30.450]  So you know you're buying something.
[03:44:30.670 --> 03:44:32.790]  There's a memento that you really backed what we're doing.
[03:44:33.450 --> 03:44:36.590]  The campaign coins, challenge coins, they're all there.
[03:44:37.819 --> 03:44:41.059]  So the posters run from $19.95 to $29.95.
[03:44:41.360 --> 03:44:44.139]  And we'll have new limited edition posters after that.
[03:44:44.620 --> 03:44:49.959]  But the posters on January 6th will be no more.
[03:44:50.659 --> 03:44:51.700]  They're limited edition.
[03:44:51.899 --> 03:44:54.399]  So if you get your order in by then, you will get the poster.
[03:44:54.579 --> 03:44:55.559]  Because they're print on demand.
[03:44:55.559 --> 03:44:56.200]  They're in Arkansas.
[03:44:56.680 --> 03:44:58.959]  If you want one of these posters, there they are.
[03:44:59.399 --> 03:45:03.399]  And again, you've got until January 6th to get your order in.
[03:45:03.579 --> 03:45:04.760]  They look great hanging on the wall.
[03:45:04.819 --> 03:45:06.540]  We got them hanging here in Arkansas.
[03:45:07.610 --> 03:45:09.450]  And I designed all of these.
[03:45:09.629 --> 03:45:14.909]  My favorite is the Trump graph that I showed the day before the election that predicted the election.
[03:45:15.049 --> 03:45:17.090]  I said, she's going to try to steal it, but it's going to fail.
[03:45:17.290 --> 03:45:22.329]  So the blue line goes up, it goes straight up, but it's not enough fraud to overpower the landslide.
[03:45:22.469 --> 03:45:24.489]  And that's actually the graph that actually happened.
[03:45:24.909 --> 03:45:25.950]  The key battlegrounds.
[03:45:26.149 --> 03:45:27.889]  So you talk about nailing it, baby.
[03:45:28.250 --> 03:45:29.110]  That's my favorite.
[03:45:29.229 --> 03:45:30.030]  I designed that one.
[03:45:30.209 --> 03:45:32.329]  And then the 47th one I designed as well.
[03:45:32.469 --> 03:45:33.590]  So I designed those.
[03:45:34.250 --> 03:45:36.530]  I did not design the Darkest Hour one, but there it is.
[03:45:36.629 --> 03:45:37.309]  Thank you for the support.
[03:45:37.430 --> 03:45:38.010]  I've done plugging.
[03:45:38.430 --> 03:45:46.010]  I've just been looking at all the attacks and our victories in court, and I realized how much money it takes to take these people on, and they are so pissed we're still on air.
[03:45:46.729 --> 03:45:48.729]  And I have hired high-powered lawyers.
[03:45:48.850 --> 03:45:49.530]  That's why we're winning.
[03:45:55.399 --> 03:46:00.000]  My lawyers are working seven days a week.
[03:46:00.579 --> 03:46:02.180]  Because I go and meet with them almost every day.
[03:46:02.340 --> 03:46:04.219]  I mean, they call me at midnight and say, come to the office.
[03:46:04.340 --> 03:46:05.979]  I want you to read this and sign it, make sure it's accurate.
[03:46:06.139 --> 03:46:06.540]  I mean, we are.
[03:46:07.440 --> 03:46:14.780]  If I told you all the suits we followed on and all the crap we're doing to bloom, you know, to the whole deep state, because I can't be on defense anymore.
[03:46:14.819 --> 03:46:15.520]  I got to go on offense.
[03:46:16.180 --> 03:46:17.620]  It would take an hour to go over it all.
[03:46:18.639 --> 03:46:20.559]  But you want me to fight, I'm fighting.
[03:46:21.700 --> 03:46:22.020]  So...
[03:46:23.139 --> 03:46:31.620]  You're financing the current operation, you're financing the back of Palos Jones Network if it gets shut down, and that's still getting built and expanded, not a larger studio, almost done.
[03:46:32.739 --> 03:46:34.719]  And you're financing the legal defense and offense.
[03:46:34.979 --> 03:46:35.899]  I mean, this is a war.
[03:46:36.000 --> 03:46:37.079]  You want somebody to fight for you?
[03:46:37.540 --> 03:46:38.479]  I love it.
[03:46:39.040 --> 03:46:41.860]  I mean, I'm begging for you to keep me in the game, keep me in the fight, Coach.
[03:46:42.020 --> 03:46:43.459]  But I'm here, you're serving.
[03:46:43.760 --> 03:46:44.799]  You commission me.
[03:46:45.819 --> 03:46:51.780]  Look, I won't stop regardless of what happens, but I'm asking you to empower me, and I will give you everything I got.
[03:46:52.100 --> 03:46:58.459]  I'm so focused right now and so sick of this crap and the stuff I've been doing to my family behind the scenes, just absolutely criminal.
[03:46:59.040 --> 03:47:01.799]  And so all I'm asking for is the support to keep fighting.
[03:47:02.409 --> 03:47:03.930]  And we make it easy with incredible products, okay?
[03:47:04.049 --> 03:47:04.469]  I'm done.
