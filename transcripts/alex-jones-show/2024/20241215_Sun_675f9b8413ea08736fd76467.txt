[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:10.939]  It's Sunday, December 15th, 2024, and I have completely solved the drone invasion mystery.
[00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:35.619]  It is Sunday, December 15th, 2024. We are 35 days, 18 hours, 59 minutes, 37 seconds until the inauguration of the populist President Donald John Trump.
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.460]  All right.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.000]  I have been researching at least 12 hours a day yesterday and today.
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.420]  I mean, I've been up since 5 a.m.
[00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.689]  researching And making phone calls and confirming my analysis.
[00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:10.230]  And what I'm going to tell you tonight is my own research, a huge understanding of history, and a consensus with folks, former current intelligence agencies,
[00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:28.099]  former military officers specialists in weapons of mass destruction detection, radioactive isotope detection, Previous pre-programming by the globalists about what they're planning, massive research on the entire UFO,
[00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:33.579]  UAP, UFV phenomenon, and more.
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:42.379]  And of course, we have hours of predictions from me that if Trump was able to win the election on November 5th, that there were multiple tracks the globalists were pre-programming.
[00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:50.469]  To try to, A, keep him from making it into office, or B, take control of the agenda by crises.
[00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.989]  That, of course, is new viral releases or hyping them up, a new pandemic or multiple pandemics.
[00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.109]  That is accelerating the war with Russia, which they did.
[00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.549]  They're now rolling out the pandemic.
[00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:03.790]  They're also...
[00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.300]  Pushing that Trump arresting the illegal aliens is some type of Hitlerian activity that's illegal.
[00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:16.099]  And the military should stage a coup against him and that the Democrats are going to have all these states secede.
[00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.099]  So they're getting some false flags ready to try to make that look legitimate.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.620]  And they've been saying that.
[00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:22.800]  We're going to have an uprising.
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.340]  The black people are about to be targeted by Trump supporters.
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.599]  So we've got to have an armed uprising.
[00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:27.560]  James Carville and others.
[00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.139]  All of those, they've warmed up and are pushing...
[00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.009]  Headlong.
[00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:34.509]  Also economic collapse.
[00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.870]  Mass cyber attack blamed on Russia.
[00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.490]  Those are all the things I said that they'd already pre-programmed that they've now gone into fever pitch on or light speed pushing.
[00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.569]  So the bad guys are not giving up.
[00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.469]  There's another big one that I would just add on like a cherry and any regular listener knows this.
[00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.610]  You just type in Alex Jones predicts government could use fake alien invasion as pretext to bring in world government because they've said they'd do that.
[00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.180]  Before I was born, there were Senate reports and documents and statements.
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.979]  I mean, everybody knows about that.
[00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.080]  You don't need me to tell you about it.
[00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:10.159]  I'm not the only one, obviously, that knows about it.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:26.039]  But they are 100% acting like they don't know what these drones, UAPs, UAVs, you know, different names they use for them, unidentified flying objects, unidentified phenomenon, unidentified vehicles, unidentified aerial vehicles, on and on and on.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.699]  But there is...
[00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.490]  No doubt that this is government and private corporations.
[00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.050]  There's no doubt that 99% of it is man-made.
[00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.629]  There's some stuff that can't be explained, but that's not what's going on right now.
[00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:49.289]  And so on each data point, I have years of real research interviewing basically all the top experts.
[00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.849]  You've heard them here.
[00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.150]  I know you're smart too, folks.
[00:03:52.270 --> 00:04:00.280]  I'm just saying I have a real job to do tonight when I say I'm going to solve the mystery because I know exactly what they're doing.
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.719]  I know who the players are.
[00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.979]  I know what the different scenarios are.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.500]  I know what the different agendas are.
[00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.000]  I understand the globalists, when they roll something out, they only push it if it helps every one of their agendas.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.699]  And this doesn't.
[00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.540]  And so, I've overdone the deep dive here.
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.459]  But I'm going to give you the synopsis up front.
[00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:22.189]  The conclusion.
[00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.970]  And then I'm going to walk through the evidence and just give you snapshots of each piece of the evidence that you can go look at for yourself.
[00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:31.430]  And then we have to ask, why are they doing it?
[00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:33.689]  Well, that's the answer to the mystery.
[00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:40.689]  So, and the different agendas that are going here are all very important as well.
[00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:46.149]  But they got a couple laws they want to pass, new ones they want to reauthorize, or older laws.
[00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.810]  I mean, we know exactly what they're doing.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.980]  And I'm going to lay it all out tonight so people have the answers.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.379]  It is Sunday, December 15, 2024. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.379]  You can see the headline up there.
[00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:12.910]  From X, at Real Alex Jones, Sunday bombshell exclusive.
[00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.930]  Alex Jones has discovered the mystery of the drone UAP invasion.
[00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.949]  This is an absolute must-watch-share emergency broadcast.
[00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.949]  It is 4.06 Central Standard Time.
[00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.689]  We are 35 days out from the inauguration of President Trump.
[00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.029]  Okay.
[00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.449]  I have several hundred clips.
[00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.889]  I have hundreds of articles and documents.
[00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:36.910]  I have the legislation.
[00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.990]  I have the laws.
[00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.009]  I have the sources.
[00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:39.970]  I have it all.
[00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:48.350]  And so my job is very easy exposing what's happening, but it's like drinking out of a fire hose.
[00:05:49.610 --> 00:06:02.290]  So I'm going to do my best to just give a synopsis, then I'm going to go through large chunks of it and point you to the full documents, the full reports, the full information as your homework if you want to go verify everything I'm about to say.
[00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:05.230]  Because like Reagan said, trust but verify.
[00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.430]  And I really want you to understand...
[00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:23.129]  That I've done thousands of years of research over the years on this, interviewed hundreds and hundreds of guests, and have all these different sources from different angles in the private aerospace, in intelligence agencies, the military, government, all of it.
[00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:38.910]  And I can tell you that I've been on the phone for intensely for the last few weeks, and really intensely the last four or five days, and there's a consensus that Of what I'm about to say by very informed people.
[00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:40.310]  So here's the bottom line.
[00:06:41.449 --> 00:07:00.930]  We're being lied to when the Pentagon and the Biden administration and the FBI tells you that they don't know what's going on and that this isn't U.S. government and it's not U.S. corporations and it's not friendly governments.
[00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:16.990]  And that it's not foreign governments, and they don't know what it is, but there's no problem.
[00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:23.230]  And this doesn't pose any type of security threat.
[00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:26.970]  I mean, that is preposterous, and we played the clips.
[00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:28.810]  I mean, Kirby says that.
[00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.389]  The State Department and the Pentagon say that word for word.
[00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:32.629]  This isn't us.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:39.100]  It isn't foreign governments, we don't know what it is, and it doesn't pose any threat.
[00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:45.879]  Now, it's been intensifying the last two years But it's been going on for a long time.
[00:07:46.019 --> 00:08:01.759]  U.S. naval ships, military bases, nuke bases, the most critical bases, critical infrastructure, nuclear power plants, will have a whole swarm, in most cases, other times a few, little bitty orbs that are super fast, a whole bunch of large craft,
[00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:07.420]  you name it, show up, and then the fighter jets show up, and they don't shoot them down.
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.720]  They don't even try.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.019]  Now, that's...
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:13.980]  Huge evidence right there.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.000]  But again, there's so much.
[00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:15.800]  Let me walk through it all.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]  Piece by piece here.
[00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:17.839]  And then I'll give you the conclusion.
[00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:20.699]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:25.759]  You're being lied to that they don't know where they're coming from.
[00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:30.839]  You're being lied to that they don't pose a threat.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.279]  And there is a larger PSYOP or psychological operation here.
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.000]  And on its face...
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.100]  You know they're lying to you.
[00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:53.340]  Standard procedure since the mid-50s is if an aircraft's over restricted airspace and doesn't respond for a certain amount of time fighter aircraft come and or it gets shot down or both.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:07.139]  So first they tell you we don't know what it is or it's not happening then they go okay it is but it's not a problem and then they don't even try to shoot them down.
[00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:14.309]  So That right there tells you a lot.
[00:09:14.549 --> 00:09:22.990]  Then we look at the craft that are swarming New Jersey and New York and military bases and cities all over the United States and other popular areas of the world.
[00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.830]  It's happening everywhere.
[00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:26.009]  But particularly here.
[00:09:26.789 --> 00:09:30.610]  And you can see in most cases those are known drone aircraft.
[00:09:32.289 --> 00:09:34.370]  Then you've got the luminous orbs.
[00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.110]  We've got a lot of leaks in intel.
[00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:38.570]  That's human technology.
[00:09:40.549 --> 00:09:48.850]  But them sitting there claiming they don't know what these are in broad daylight over New York in the last few weeks where these pods are flying around in front of everyone.
[00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:55.269]  And they're sitting over military bases and hovering and nothing's done to them.
[00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.429]  What did Trump say?
[00:09:58.549 --> 00:10:00.629]  He said, mystery drone sightings all over the country.
[00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.169]  So this Friday.
[00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.970]  Can this really be happening without our government's knowledge?
[00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.370]  I don't think so.
[00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:09.470]  Let the public know and now otherwise shoot them down.
[00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:16.970]  Now, Trump is not in office yet.
[00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:28.049]  And that's a whole other area of this that I'll be showing you government documents and openly bringing down one of the main motives here.
[00:10:30.289 --> 00:10:35.970]  But, mystery one, these are human craft.
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:44.799]  That doesn't mean throughout history and even in ancient times they got reported by all cultures that there's been something else there as well and the astronauts have seen it.
[00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:48.899]  NASA's got footage of the orbs coming up decades ago to the space station or the space shuttle.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.240]  I'm not saying there aren't other unidentified flying objects that are something else.
[00:10:57.599 --> 00:11:04.279]  Extraterrestrial, interdimensional, a breakaway human civilization that never went away, that's more advanced, Atlantis.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:11.779]  We don't know that, but we know there is phenomenon going back before the Apollo program that the craft got followed around.
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.240]  Our craft got followed around the moon.
[00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:14.960]  There's film footage of it.
[00:11:15.139 --> 00:11:16.320]  The astronauts reported it.
[00:11:16.419 --> 00:11:16.980]  It was on the news.
[00:11:17.039 --> 00:11:17.840]  They said, we don't know.
[00:11:18.259 --> 00:11:20.860]  So that mystery is not solved.
[00:11:22.169 --> 00:11:30.809]  But the craft over New Jersey, the craft over New York, the craft harassing U.S. bases, particularly nuclear bases that have nuclear weapons.
[00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:40.570]  And then a drone crashes a few days ago in New Jersey, and the police come and cover it up and take it away.
[00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.169]  I mean, why don't they just show it to you?
[00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:44.710]  And who's telling them not to show it to you?
[00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.850]  And what the witnesses and people said is it just looked like a big drone, propellers, all of it.
[00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.429]  Vertical, you know, takeoff aircraft.
[00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:06.570]  So, there is a drone or self-flying autonomous revolution.
[00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.190]  And the laws are all about to be changed.
[00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.330]  They're in Congress right now.
[00:12:11.009 --> 00:12:13.149]  We decide who can do it, where, and why.
[00:12:13.309 --> 00:12:21.029]  And big corporations that are quietly developing all this are lobbying that there be major controls in everybody else, but not them, just like with AI. Right?
[00:12:21.669 --> 00:12:25.049]  Big corporations with the government don't want the general public or smaller companies to have access.
[00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:27.110]  They want to create a bunch of fear.
[00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:31.429]  They want to pass laws, I'll show you in a moment, that put a lot of restrictions on it.
[00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.850]  So that's one layer here.
[00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:36.590]  And we'll go over the details of it.
[00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:37.470]  We've got two hours here.
[00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.649]  But I'm giving you the synopsis right now.
[00:12:41.009 --> 00:12:53.830]  But the bigger piece here is the distraction from the Biden pardons of Incredible criminals.
[00:12:55.309 --> 00:13:03.669]  The judge that would make parents pay money or he'd CPS and take their innocent, you know, kids and they were innocent away.
[00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:07.750]  And people that stole, you know, 50-something million dollars from taxpayers in Illinois.
[00:13:07.929 --> 00:13:08.710]  I mean, on and on and on.
[00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:13.289]  And you've got the war in Ukraine and that escalation, a diversion from that.
[00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:18.830]  And you've got our government putting Al-Qaeda in charge with the help of Israel and Turkey and Syria.
[00:13:19.029 --> 00:13:21.809]  And you've got the NATO overthrowing a week and a half ago.
[00:13:23.649 --> 00:13:32.129]  Romania and their election and setting up a NATO coup there and more bombing of Russia with attack of missiles last week.
[00:13:34.549 --> 00:13:40.730]  So it's a big, new, shiny object, literally and figuratively.
[00:13:42.049 --> 00:13:43.409]  But then...
[00:13:45.169 --> 00:13:52.769]  You've got, here's a microcosm example, the FBI hyping for years, white supremacists are going to blow up power grids everywhere, and they secretly work for Trump and the Russians.
[00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.409]  No evidence of that crazy.
[00:13:54.490 --> 00:14:01.309]  And I said in the last six months, look for around the election, that they'll start foiling white supremacist groups that are going to blow up power stations.
[00:14:01.429 --> 00:14:04.049]  And they busted a bunch of them around the country the day before the election.
[00:14:05.909 --> 00:14:20.309]  Now, you do that, so when you do attack the power grid, well, we stopped at some, but we missed this one, and it's already pre-programmed in your mind that that's what Trump supporters do, that they're white supremacists, that's not true, and that they're going to blow up power stations.
[00:14:20.669 --> 00:14:25.070]  Well, it's the same thing with these UAPs, UAVs, UFOs, whatever you want to call them.
[00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.830]  Oh, it's the government, and they floated that story.
[00:14:30.659 --> 00:14:41.539]  The government thinks that there are stolen nukes or dirty bombs in New Jersey, in New York, been hearing that for weeks, and these drones are out there to identify those that keep you safe.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:50.039]  That way, when a nuke goes off or a tactical nuke or a giant dirty bomb, well, then it's like, well, we tried to stop it.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.559]  And then that can be done right before Trump gets in.
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.559]  And I didn't just say that tonight.
[00:14:55.899 --> 00:14:58.639]  The crew went in today because I asked them to, and I said, search for times.
[00:15:00.059 --> 00:15:05.559]  Where I said they could stage a nuke even here, or Europe, or Ukraine.
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.379]  Blame it on the Russians, because we know the Ukrainian nukes were Russian-made.
[00:15:08.379 --> 00:15:12.919]  When they detonate, they will have that signature of isotopes.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.679]  And we know there are at least 80 that came up missing out of Ukraine.
[00:15:15.679 --> 00:15:16.639]  That's mainstream news.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.419]  I have those articles here, but we've talked about that for decades.
[00:15:21.059 --> 00:15:24.220]  The missing Russian and Ukrainian and other nukes.
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:37.110]  Well, they're back hyping it, and they've leaked out of the Pentagon and leaked out of their people Who mean well when they're giving it and come out and say, oh, I hear this is drones sensing for nukes or radioactive devices.
[00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:49.950]  And I've talked to a lot of my sources and some are coming on the show this week that used to run major teams doing that, like Craig Sawyer and others.
[00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.159]  And They use trucks to do that.
[00:15:55.299 --> 00:15:56.539]  They have devices.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:01.000]  You drive by on light poles and things at the border, but also another coming into big cities.
[00:16:01.159 --> 00:16:11.139]  You drive into a toll road in New York or New Jersey or other places, you see all these antennas and wires and things and weird devices that you never, you know, like something out of a science fiction movie, pointed at your car.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.919]  They're scanning for radioactive isotopes and other things.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:19.559]  And they've got passive x-ray scanners that are super toxic for you driving through it and those that work around it.
[00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:21.620]  But that's what's there, okay?
[00:16:26.529 --> 00:16:29.809]  So, it's not done with these type of drones.
[00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:38.309]  Yeah, they can be fitted with them, but they weigh so much, on average, they're so big that the sensors aren't strong enough that they've got on these things.
[00:16:39.409 --> 00:16:41.149]  They don't need big sensors for chemicals.
[00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:58.019]  But, again, ladies and gentlemen, that's because most of these systems fire a powerful beam out And then there is a reflection back, some of the radar sonar, from the isotope and a reading they get.
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:10.339]  All a sniffing drone for chemicals needs is sensors in there that scoop up the air and have a filter and then they pick it up and then report back or go back and they download the information.
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:16.680]  So the reason I mention that is every point I make has thousands of research points behind it, okay?
[00:17:16.759 --> 00:17:19.180]  So it's impossible to give you all the evidence on each piece.
[00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:21.880]  It would take 50 hours or longer.
[00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:26.299]  But when I'm sitting here telling you something, this is what's going on.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:30.099]  So...
[00:17:30.099 --> 00:17:36.740]  You have to ask then, why are they hyping this?
[00:17:36.839 --> 00:17:38.039]  It's because there might be a nuke.
[00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.269]  Or something along those lines on the East Coast.
[00:17:41.509 --> 00:17:45.529]  Now, you can go back a year ago, six months ago, right before the election.
[00:17:46.049 --> 00:17:48.269]  Crew found the clips, but if I play those, it'll take the whole show.
[00:17:48.589 --> 00:17:49.430]  I said it.
[00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:51.369]  Mike Adams said it.
[00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:52.829]  Jack Posobiec said it.
[00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.349]  General Flynn said it.
[00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:57.650]  I mean, the crew found over 100 clips.
[00:17:58.549 --> 00:18:14.170]  Of us on the show, me and my guests, myself and the guests, saying another big thing they could do is set off a nuke, maybe even kill Trump with a nuke, or set one off to create a national emergency as Trump is coming in, and or, again, detonate one here, or in Ukraine or Europe,
[00:18:14.529 --> 00:18:19.170]  and blame the Russians.
[00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:24.430]  And there'll be such anger, a lot of people will, you know, pile onto that.
[00:18:25.869 --> 00:18:29.109]  So that's a very chilling area of this.
[00:18:33.109 --> 00:18:53.089]  But then, when I get into the laws that are on the books and the laws they're trying to pass, and there's two of those right now, there's then another law passed in 2007,
[00:18:53.089 --> 00:18:54.690]  and this is the meat of it right now.
[00:18:57.119 --> 00:19:12.759]  That they added to the continuity of government system that they got Congress to pass, so it's a law, that not just for a nuclear attack, not just for a biological attack, not just for an economic collapse, or asteroid, or massive natural disaster,
[00:19:13.339 --> 00:19:26.710]  but for any type of drone or UAP, UAV crisis, the continuity of government, NORTHCOM, Real shadow government, real deep state.
[00:19:26.829 --> 00:19:30.029]  I don't mean just bureaucrats that are always there that we call the deep state that are one layer.
[00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:31.970]  I mean the official deep state.
[00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:39.470]  It's based in NORAD in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and in Cheyenne Mountain nearby.
[00:19:42.009 --> 00:19:45.390]  And at Mount Weather and Site R. Write all this down, folks.
[00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:46.410]  I mean, real names here.
[00:19:46.609 --> 00:19:53.269]  People know about Cheyenne Mountain, but you know about Site R? Most folks don't, but it's on the record.
[00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.390]  Nobody knows about it.
[00:19:54.609 --> 00:19:55.950]  Maybe one out of 50 million.
[00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:58.529]  Mount Weather.
[00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.509]  I mean, you need to learn about these terms I'm giving.
[00:20:01.589 --> 00:20:02.230]  These are just a few.
[00:20:02.869 --> 00:20:04.410]  You spend days on each old term.
[00:20:04.529 --> 00:20:05.190]  I just gave each old name.
[00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:25.119]  So, under the COG law since 2007 that was updated, they can use any phenomenon of unidentified craft to To then kick in the hundreds and hundreds, hell, it's got to be trillions of dollars in black budget COG infrastructure,
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:33.859]  the underground bases, the underground railways, the underground systems, to trigger that and to get that in place.
[00:20:34.079 --> 00:20:39.539]  And then why would you trigger and activate that when it's already there, unless you're about to kill Trump?
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:53.960]  Or set off a nuke, because that'll certainly get Trump off his agenda of getting the border shut down and turning the energy back on and getting us out of the Paris global carbon tax system and blocking the central bank digital currencies and all the things he's doing.
[00:20:56.269 --> 00:21:16.450]  Well, when they warm up and fire up and go from just operating in the background, the whole NORTHCOM, COG, alternate government system, they're now firing that up as they are already dissolving national sovereignty and the power of the presidency to fold that in.
[00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:29.349]  And then the COG system appoints the new regional governors of the 10 FEMA regions, That could also be done under the UN treaty.
[00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:37.829]  We didn't sign it because we exposed it, but it's still operating because it's the US government and Biden and the globalists that wrote the new UN treaty.
[00:21:38.009 --> 00:21:38.450]  Look it up.
[00:21:38.609 --> 00:21:40.289]  So they don't even care if it didn't pass.
[00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.950]  They're going to use COG, continuity of government.
[00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:52.450]  They're going to use the NORTHCOM system.
[00:21:53.789 --> 00:21:54.269]  So...
[00:21:55.250 --> 00:22:02.650]  New legislation for drone control and this new drone department like the FAA. Show you that.
[00:22:05.089 --> 00:22:07.269]  Reauthorize the FAA's expanded powers.
[00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:12.109]  They are coming up in literal weeks to be not voted on if they don't fund it.
[00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:14.330]  Reauthorization.
[00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.950]  And there's a fight between this new agency they want to set up and the old agency.
[00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:19.769]  So it's also interagency stuff.
[00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:33.230]  And you've got, when the military at a base says, we don't know why there's 15 of these, you know, 10 foot long, 12 foot long, 14 foot long things right over us when we're told don't shoot them down.
[00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:34.410]  Well, they're not lying.
[00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:35.910]  They're compartmentalized.
[00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:37.309]  They're just told, no, you can't shoot them down.
[00:22:39.009 --> 00:22:48.099]  That order comes from NORAD. NORAD tells the military bases, the Army, the Marines, the Navy, what they can shoot now.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:59.039]  The National Reconnaissance Office gives the information to NORAD. Well, who's over this new legislation they're trying to pass for total drone control?
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:06.599]  Not the FAA. NORAD. So it's also agencies fighting with each other over...
[00:23:06.599 --> 00:23:11.529]  That's why Trump created Space Force, was to try to draw power out of NASA. Oh, you won't do what I say?
[00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:12.569]  Well, I'll just create a new agency.
[00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:20.890]  See, that's just like Kennedy created NASA because the Pentagon wasn't listening to him on space exploration and we're stonewalling.
[00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:21.910]  He says, well, I'll just create a new thing.
[00:23:22.809 --> 00:23:26.230]  So there's layer upon layer upon layer upon layer.
[00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:28.049]  It diverts the public.
[00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.190]  It changes the subject from all the stuff they want to cover up.
[00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:31.150]  It's a diversion.
[00:23:33.569 --> 00:23:39.630]  It gives them cover stories that, oh, there might be nukes in case they want to detonate one of those to bring in the martial law.
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.099]  And activate the COG NORTHCOM control.
[00:23:44.119 --> 00:23:49.619]  NORTHCOM has got its own legislation set for its own new agency.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:55.339]  The FAA wants its new powers and its new authorization over this.
[00:24:02.019 --> 00:24:14.299]  And all of this hysteria and fear gives more power to NORAD and NORTHCOM. It's way more powerful than the FAA because they're the experts on this to be able to go to Congress and say, no, give us the power.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:35.400]  But if you pull back from all of that, and unfortunately no one's doing a full spectrum analysis of this other than We're good to go.
[00:24:48.269 --> 00:24:56.089]  That puts NORTHCOM over a national emergency and can trigger a national emergency that's not even declared to the public at first.
[00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.210]  They can do whatever they want.
[00:24:58.369 --> 00:25:00.829]  And Congress passed this law.
[00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:06.150]  So basically, the shadow government's fighting with itself over power.
[00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:07.109]  Trump's coming in.
[00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:27.230]  They've triggered this crisis using corporate drones so they can deny and say it's not the government, but those corporate aerospace companies have contracts and are the highest level of national security in NORAD, in NORTHCOM, and they're the main,
[00:25:27.309 --> 00:25:36.859]  not even suspects, it's them, that are over this, and they're deploying this To carry out and enforce a bunch of agendas.
[00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:38.759]  So, we know it's human.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.299]  We know the government's lying.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.799]  We know most of the government's compartmentalized and lied to as well.
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.160]  The average FBI agent is not guilty at all.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.619]  The average congressperson has no idea what's going on.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.420]  Only a few senators on key committees have some oversight in this.
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:26:06.579]  And this is your rogue, out-of-control, scientific dictatorship that President Eisenhower warns you in his farewell address in, what, January, Was it 18th, 19th?
[00:26:06.859 --> 00:26:07.980]  Was it 16th?
[00:26:08.619 --> 00:26:10.859]  1961. It's only 21 minutes long.
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:11.359]  Go watch it.
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:11.779]  It's on YouTube.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:31.930]  Then he said there's a scientific technological elite now in control of over 90% of all research funds And they've basically broken away into creating a new civilization, and they control the military-industrial complex, and they need to be controlled and broken up because they pose the greatest danger to the future of our republic,
[00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:32.849]  not the communist.
[00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:34.450]  Go watch the speech.
[00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:35.769]  Go read the transcript.
[00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.769]  He said that.
[00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:39.210]  Basically, quote it word for word.
[00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:44.630]  So that's Eisenhower, the former supreme allied commander in World War II, all of it.
[00:26:45.619 --> 00:26:52.319]  So, and that's 1961. And then Kennedy comes in and was getting the same crap from the shadow government, not letting him know what's going on.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.180]  And he goes, I'll just create a new agency.
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.000]  They didn't transfer the money to that, and I'll be in charge.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.140]  You know what they did?
[00:26:57.599 --> 00:26:58.079]  Oh, yeah?
[00:26:58.119 --> 00:26:58.940]  How's your head doing right now?
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:05.519]  So, I know every publicly known angle of this, okay?
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:10.640]  So, we are exposing the entire mystery, solving it right now.
[00:27:10.819 --> 00:27:11.299]  Stay with us.
[00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.890]  All right, again, there's so many angles to this.
[00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.990]  I'm going to start going through clips and documents right now, but let me throw a few more out.
[00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:25.029]  The future's not human, we're told by the WEF officially.
[00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:34.750]  And they're using our resources to transfer things into this breakaway civilization and replacing us with robots and AI and all the rest of it.
[00:27:35.569 --> 00:27:42.650]  And the public starts getting hysterical and they're thinking aircraft coming in for landings are UFOs just because it's nighttime and they can't identify them.
[00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:50.329]  And that brings us back to 1938. Predictive programming, or is it irony?
[00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:59.349]  Orson Welles' fictional Martian invasion known as the War of the Worlds took place in New Jersey.
[00:27:59.509 --> 00:28:00.730]  Where's this happening right now?
[00:28:01.539 --> 00:28:02.799]  It was just a radio play.
[00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:12.680]  In 1938, radio broadcasts and announcer described a Martian emerging from a large metallic cylinder in the Farmers Field of New Jersey and the invasion spreading through the state.
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:19.980]  The broadcast impact was significant with many listeners believing this were real and some even fleeing their homes in panic and shooting up water towers.
[00:28:20.259 --> 00:28:33.599]  And of course, H.G. Wells, head of the Fabian Society, top globalist, proto-globalist, He wrote the book that Orson Welles, no relation, wrote about.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.480]  So, yeah, this is a psyop big time.
[00:28:44.099 --> 00:28:47.500]  And we're going to go over the different angles of it right now.
[00:28:48.039 --> 00:28:52.200]  But the first thing I wanted to play for you is a short clip that I'll actually show you the law.
[00:28:53.529 --> 00:28:58.150]  The full hour and a half interview is on Real Alex Jones at X, and it's also at band.video.
[00:28:59.089 --> 00:29:12.650]  The UAP UFO invasion may be used to trigger NORTHCOM's continuity of government national emergency powers to stop Trump, said journalist who's written for the Wall Street Journal, you name it, Daniel List, who does an excellent job.
[00:29:14.029 --> 00:29:16.210]  And then here is the law.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:35.539]  It was a directive, and then Congress passed it as a law, Directive on National Continuity Policy, May 4th, 2024, and then Congress agreed to it, passed it in law for the funding for any type of mass UFO event,
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:48.339]  Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, but the power goes to NORAD and to the COG. Unmanned aircraft operations in national airspace systems.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:49.920]  All right?
[00:29:50.259 --> 00:29:57.240]  And it was Dick Cheney who was instrumental in getting that done.
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:09.000]  And then I'm going to show you some of the laws they want reauthorized and some of the new laws they're trying to pass right now while this is happening.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.299]  Just like they tried to pass the Patriot Act, couldn't, and 9-11.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.480]  And then now you know it was always for you.
[00:30:14.599 --> 00:30:15.400]  The border's wide open.
[00:30:15.599 --> 00:30:17.599]  Legal aliens fly without IDs, but you do.
[00:30:17.819 --> 00:30:19.039]  You face scan, they don't.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:20.460]  That's on record.
[00:30:20.599 --> 00:30:22.039]  Savannah Hernandez was at the airport last week.
[00:30:22.119 --> 00:30:23.440]  Our former reporter put it on her page.
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:28.140]  And she showed the illegals with the Manolo envelopes being passed through without face scans or proving who they were.
[00:30:28.259 --> 00:30:30.900]  They wanted her to face scan and said it was the law, even though it's not.
[00:30:32.339 --> 00:30:32.920]  It's not the law.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.440]  The law says they can't make you do it.
[00:30:34.619 --> 00:30:37.960]  And I have to tell you, they have little signs that say optional for the last few years.
[00:30:38.059 --> 00:30:39.440]  Now they've taken those down to most airports.
[00:30:39.839 --> 00:30:41.740]  They still have it in Austin last time I flew.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.819]  But when I was flying out of Detroit three, four months ago and I was up there for a TPUSA event, didn't have the sign up there and got mad at me when I said no.
[00:30:52.319 --> 00:30:53.940]  And to get over here and get patted down.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.779]  So again, perfect example of that.
[00:30:58.539 --> 00:31:01.579]  It's not about security, it's about control over you.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.759]  So here is Daniel List on Friday talking about him.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:14.420]  What it is in the heart of this program really is how do you activate emergency powers?
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.640]  Which is, you know, what are the actual protocols for doing it?
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.799]  What's the level of threat that you need to actually replace the president?
[00:31:21.939 --> 00:31:29.160]  And it's very clear, if you look at the continuity of government profile and in their deep details, what they did is they changed.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:37.039]  In the 1980s, they started a change, and that was involved with Rumsfeld when he was the CEO of a chemical company, a pharmaceutical company.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:45.700]  And Cheney was in there, and it was unusual because the COG thing kind of went underground a little bit during the Clinton era because they had a lot of shifting around to do.
[00:31:45.799 --> 00:31:50.240]  As soon as they got Bush and 9-11, they activated COG during 9-11.
[00:31:50.529 --> 00:32:05.769]  And, you know, we had some unusual things and some unusual crossover with the assassination attempt on Trump, because the Secret Service leader at that point was the same woman who had dragged Dick Cheney into the COG bunker during 9-11.
[00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:08.650]  Well, I don't mention Cheney as just kind of a punchline.
[00:32:08.809 --> 00:32:15.470]  He was deeply involved with crafting the continuity of government protocols in 2007, before they left.
[00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:17.789]  And he was a protege of limited, sir.
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:23.319]  Who got fired by Kennedy for trying to do a COG. Yes, absolutely.
[00:32:23.619 --> 00:32:31.359]  And that's where, you know, when you get that whole Operation Northwoods thing, Ed, you really put Operation Northwoods on the radar.
[00:32:31.359 --> 00:32:40.779]  And it's very interesting because Operation Northwoods tumbled out of these JFK assassination documents late in the 1990s, 30, 40 years after the assassination.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.420]  So we only got that piece that much later.
[00:32:43.579 --> 00:32:58.619]  We know that the National Reconnaissance Office was set up In the 1961, under the Kennedy administration, we didn't get to know about the NRO until 1994. That's a 30-year lag time for the secret black program inside the government.
[00:32:58.839 --> 00:33:02.880]  Well, the government programs that we have around the UFO file exist.
[00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:06.200]  That's where the whole idea of the secret space program comes from.
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:17.079]  There's been a lot of disinformation about that, but the real thing, the hardcore thing, Is when we had the NASA hacker go in, Gary McKinnon, and when he saw in NASA... Okay, so let's stop right there.
[00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:19.119]  The full interview is an hour and a half long.
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:23.539]  That's just a quick clip from it, and then later he goes over the documents there on air that I just showed you.
[00:33:24.299 --> 00:33:39.690]  So, now let's look at this stack of what is Elon Musk really saying about the UAV, UAP, UFO... Off-the-chart acceleration of activity in every major industrialized world.
[00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:46.630]  Well, he put out last Friday morning at 2 in the morning, people were asking, well, what's your statement?
[00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:53.769]  He put an image out of your radio listener, I'll describe it, and it shows an Ayatollah on top of a flying saucer flying over the Middle East.
[00:33:55.019 --> 00:33:57.720]  With a bunch of other classic flying saucers behind him.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.880]  And it says, everyone, please stop creating fake narratives for war.
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:03.059]  U.S. government or the government.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:03.400]  Boom.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.559]  Remember last week they tried to say Iran had motherships off the coast.
[00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:12.800]  And the sheriff's department saying, no, we saw 50 of these orbs flying off the ocean over the city.
[00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.329]  And then the Pentagon goes, oh no, that's not Iran.
[00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:18.730]  That's not us.
[00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:21.409]  We don't know who it is, but don't worry, it's not dangerous.
[00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:22.989]  We don't know who it is.
[00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:23.769]  It's not us.
[00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:24.949]  It's not a foreign government, though.
[00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:25.670]  We know that.
[00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:30.090]  Not an Iranian submarine, but it's not a threat.
[00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:32.110]  That's designed to create fear.
[00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:33.349]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:34.730]  They know they're discredited.
[00:34:34.789 --> 00:34:35.750]  They know no one believes them.
[00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:40.429]  So they know by telling you something, that gives people even more scared.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.920]  They use their weakness as a strength.
[00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:44.940]  But what has Musk really been saying?
[00:34:45.039 --> 00:34:48.500]  He actually did months ago warn about this and predict.
[00:34:48.619 --> 00:34:54.579]  Here are his posts on X. Here is Elon Musk.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.719]  And this is him again months ago.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:00.619]  Let me give you the actual data.
[00:35:00.639 --> 00:35:04.940]  I've got it here in our boil down article from Infowars.com.
[00:35:05.139 --> 00:35:07.219]  September 30th, September 29th.
[00:35:10.679 --> 00:35:15.940]  January 5th, 2023. So this is from September of this year, a few months ago.
[00:35:16.119 --> 00:35:18.960]  And this is from last year, like 11 months ago.
[00:35:19.179 --> 00:35:19.559]  Okay?
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.639]  Let me read to you.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.159]  Here's shots of those.
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.519]  They're still on his X account.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.199]  This is September 30th.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.099]  Drone swarm battles are coming that will boggle the mind.
[00:35:31.239 --> 00:35:32.699]  And two months later, it happens.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.880]  Elon Musk, September 29th.
[00:35:35.019 --> 00:35:36.980]  Drone, epic drone wars coming.
[00:35:38.519 --> 00:35:43.280]  The drone wars are already a big deal, but we ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:35:44.679 --> 00:35:51.000]  In a moment, I'm going to show you over Arizona last night, a drone being shot down.
[00:35:52.099 --> 00:35:54.300]  Then we've got footage in New Jersey.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.360]  These are confirmed videos.
[00:35:55.599 --> 00:35:56.099]  These are real.
[00:35:57.019 --> 00:36:01.780]  The FBI says, we don't know what that is, of drones firing tracer machine gun fire.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.739]  But of course it's on a military base.
[00:36:05.019 --> 00:36:07.980]  Now, does anyone believe the military doesn't attack something shooting at?
[00:36:08.039 --> 00:36:08.119]  No.
[00:36:09.139 --> 00:36:10.699]  They've got compartmentalized units.
[00:36:10.699 --> 00:36:11.440]  Go do this drill.
[00:36:11.579 --> 00:36:12.179]  Go do your training.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:17.780]  They've got other agencies where you've got autonomous AI. That's what a lot of this is.
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.219]  Out mapping and training.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.599]  You've got a bunch of government and corporate facilities in that area of New Jersey.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:29.300]  You have an authorized corridor in the south of New Jersey up to the north for advanced drone testing.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.460]  I'll show you all those documents.
[00:36:30.579 --> 00:36:31.659]  You can just look this up.
[00:36:33.019 --> 00:36:41.940]  Type in New Jersey Advanced Drone Corporate Governmental Proving Ground, New Jersey, and you'll read all about it for years, going back five years.
[00:36:42.679 --> 00:36:44.260]  So it's all there.
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:47.960]  They just know the public doesn't go research this, and then they just deny it, and everybody gets scared.
[00:36:50.179 --> 00:36:52.199]  So there's Elon Musk on that front.
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.300]  And it continues.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.059]  And we have a copy of this law here.
[00:37:03.679 --> 00:37:25.039]  They want Congress to pass the new HR 8610, Counter-UAV Authority, Security, Safety, and Reauthorization Act 2024. And that's new agency power, new control, new money into the FAA and into NORAD and into NORTHCOM. And that is the Counter-UAV Authority,
[00:37:25.199 --> 00:37:29.880]  which is new, Security, Safety, and Reauthorization Act, which is the Funding Act.
[00:37:31.969 --> 00:37:37.070]  Just like you always hear each year of the Defense Department budget is the Reauthorization Act, but it's a whole bunch of new stuff.
[00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.769]  So, and there's a link to that in that article there.
[00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:43.869]  Here's the article that has all this in it.
[00:37:43.949 --> 00:37:47.750]  New Jersey, drawn invasion, just in time for Congress to reauthorize Orwellian law.
[00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:51.010]  So there's that.
[00:37:51.809 --> 00:37:53.789]  Then we've got Mayorkas.
[00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:56.750]  We are limited in our authorities to take down drones.
[00:37:56.989 --> 00:37:58.550]  Oh, we don't have the money.
[00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:59.849]  We don't have the authorization.
[00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:06.170]  We need this reauthorization pass that has all the new laws and money in it.
[00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:08.289]  And then there's multiple versions.
[00:38:08.489 --> 00:38:09.949]  Some give the FAA more power.
[00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:11.090]  Some give NORAD more power.
[00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:14.510]  And there's a big debate and argument going on about that.
[00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.929]  Here is Mayorkas on ABC News yesterday.
[00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:28.570]  And in September of 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration, the FAA, changed the rules so that drones could fly at night.
[00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:37.050]  And that may be one of the reasons why now people are seeing more drones than they did before, especially from dawn to dusk.
[00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:39.150]  And so that is the reality.
[00:38:39.269 --> 00:38:42.789]  But I want to assure the American public that we are on it.
[00:38:42.889 --> 00:38:47.070]  We are working in close coordination with state and local authorities.
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:57.940]  And it is critical, as we all have said for a number of years, that we need from Congress additional authorities to address the drone situation.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:03.059]  Our authorities currently are limited and they are set to expire.
[00:39:03.059 --> 00:39:05.340]  We need them extended and expanded.
[00:39:05.619 --> 00:39:06.980]  What exactly do you need?
[00:39:09.179 --> 00:39:19.000]  We want state and local authorities to also have the ability to counter drone activity under federal supervision.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:26.159]  That is one important element that we have requested and we've heard it echoed by the state and local officials themselves.
[00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:33.800]  Now, here is video that came out this morning over Phoenix and a bunch of people saw this report on the news.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.320]  UAP shoots down drone.
[00:39:39.619 --> 00:39:40.500]  So, there's...
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.699]  And they both look like drones.
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:47.420]  They both got flashing freaking FAA lights on them.
[00:39:49.039 --> 00:39:50.739]  So, again, the public's so panicked.
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:52.960]  These are newer type drones.
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.820]  Obviously unmanned, they both look like.
[00:39:55.119 --> 00:39:57.219]  But, again, over D.C., everywhere.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:03.679]  Oh, my God, look, the flying saucers are coming in because the planes are coming in straight into the cameras and they just look like...
[00:40:04.639 --> 00:40:07.019]  Because the lights all blur together and they've got their landing lights on.
[00:40:07.099 --> 00:40:08.579]  It looks like a flying saucer.
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:10.559]  How many times have you seen that?
[00:40:10.639 --> 00:40:12.380]  I mean, where I live, the plane's coming straight.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.219]  At about 20,000 feet, they're coming into Bergstrom.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.460]  They start going down.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.559]  I live about 15 miles from the airport.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.019]  But if you live somewhere else in Austin over the flight path, you see them come in from the side.
[00:40:23.059 --> 00:40:23.699]  Oh, there's the airplane.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.300]  You see the flashing red light, the blue lights.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.820]  But when it's coming straight on, it's got its landing lights turned on.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.340]  As soon as you see them turn them on, you see it.
[00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:32.940]  A little red light off the distance.
[00:40:33.039 --> 00:40:33.400]  All of a sudden...
[00:40:34.719 --> 00:40:37.679]  Anyways, but people are like, oh my God, it's the Martians!
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:38.320]  We're all dead!
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:38.980]  Run to the hills!
[00:40:40.119 --> 00:40:42.900]  H.G. Wells, Horson Wells, War of the Worlds.
[00:40:44.219 --> 00:40:45.559]  And it goes on and on.
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.440]  Yeah, let's roll this with audio.
[00:40:47.639 --> 00:40:48.880]  This is really wild.
[00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:53.300]  These are both pretty good size unmanned aerial vehicles.
[00:40:53.539 --> 00:40:56.039]  Oh yeah, this is New Jersey.
[00:40:57.179 --> 00:41:00.219]  A couple days ago, you've got...
[00:41:02.299 --> 00:41:04.739]  Obviously a weaponized drone, which you know the Pentagon has.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.280]  By the way, there's over 10,000 predator drones.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.440]  That's an old 30-year-old drone.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.340]  The Pentagon's got hundreds of different types.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.599]  Reapers, you name it.
[00:41:13.119 --> 00:41:16.099]  And they can launch all these autonomously now.
[00:41:16.159 --> 00:41:17.800]  They don't need even humans to control them, pre-program.
[00:41:19.739 --> 00:41:22.320]  And there's, again, New Jersey's one of the few places publicly...
[00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:26.510]  That is a proving ground across much of the state.
[00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:33.590]  Most of the stuff's going on at military bases and white sands and out in the middle of nowhere so people can't see it, they don't get scared.
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:49.099]  Then five years ago, New Jersey gets authorized by NORAD and the FAA and the Pentagon jointly to be a big government-slash-corporate drone proving ground with autonomous AI air taxis, drone deliveries.
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:59.500]  You already got Walmart and Amazon all over the country with small drones delivering prescriptions and things, or a pair of socks if you want to pay for the drone delivery, and people see these drones flop and drop something down.
[00:42:00.719 --> 00:42:06.380]  Also, the FAA just recently, in the last year, authorized nighttime flights of commercial drones.
[00:42:06.579 --> 00:42:12.639]  So Mavers is right when he says that's part of the hysteria, because now people think all of these things must be nefarious.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:22.480]  All because the government doesn't tell you what's going on when they tell one unit, hey, go do your live fire training on the base, knowing they're right by a populated area.
[00:42:22.619 --> 00:42:30.119]  They see a drone shooting tracers that the average person looks like a laser beam or something from Star Wars.
[00:42:31.869 --> 00:42:38.530]  And then you get all of this just intensifying and intensifying and intensifying.
[00:42:39.409 --> 00:42:41.010]  And it is a hysteria.
[00:42:41.909 --> 00:42:44.469]  It is a mass hysteria.
[00:42:45.289 --> 00:42:47.429]  They say, don't worry, we're protecting you.
[00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:49.230]  Somebody might have snuck nukes in.
[00:42:49.289 --> 00:42:50.869]  Iran, Russia, we don't know.
[00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:53.769]  And it lets them then get your attention.
[00:42:55.159 --> 00:43:01.340]  When they can float out these things to create more fear and the backdrop for setting off a nuke.
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:02.920]  But look at this footage of your TV viewer.
[00:43:03.519 --> 00:43:13.480]  Two different drones approach each other, face off, and then one takes out the other.
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:16.500]  And then we got the tracer activity in New Jersey.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.619]  Let's roll these back to back with audio.
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:22.380]  Something's going up real fast.
[00:43:23.679 --> 00:43:24.599]  A plane?
[00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:35.030]  Whoa, is that moving quick?
[00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:37.909]  That could be a drone.
[00:43:38.289 --> 00:43:39.730]  I don't know what the hell that is.
[00:43:40.409 --> 00:43:42.050]  But that is quick.
[00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:44.849]  There's only one remaining right now.
[00:43:47.429 --> 00:43:58.150]  So the green flashing drone approaches the other lit-up red drone and comes up within a few feet and knocks it up.
[00:43:58.769 --> 00:44:00.610]  He's an electromagnetic weapon.
[00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:01.690]  Super.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:05.260]  Did it use a projectile?
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.500]  Did it fire a bolo into its rotors?
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.900]  Goes above it, comes down, and then knocks it out.
[00:44:19.219 --> 00:44:20.500]  Which is what they would do with these.
[00:44:20.599 --> 00:44:21.300]  What do the drones do?
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.739]  They go to tanks and troops and drop something on them.
[00:44:24.559 --> 00:44:27.679]  Whatever it was, just shut down the drone, if that was a drone.
[00:44:36.489 --> 00:44:40.969]  It looks like the red one, the one that was stationary, knocked out the green one.
[00:44:41.429 --> 00:44:42.269]  They got this.
[00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:48.429]  That thing is completely stationary shooting.
[00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:56.610]  Okay, so you have a bunch of different corporations and agencies and groups that are told, okay, go ahead and go do your missions.
[00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:57.530]  Go ahead and do your stuff.
[00:44:57.849 --> 00:45:00.389]  The people all signed on disclosures that worked there in the military.
[00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:01.809]  They're all compartmentalized.
[00:45:01.889 --> 00:45:02.829]  Now, let's play this with audio.
[00:45:03.369 --> 00:45:05.030]  This is over in New Jersey a week ago.
[00:45:07.659 --> 00:45:10.900]  And this was taped by different people at different angles.
[00:45:11.039 --> 00:45:12.159]  The police saw this.
[00:45:12.559 --> 00:45:13.760]  This is real.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:23.860]  Now, if you watch these, they launch from the ground, they go up, and they get at stationary points, lit up for everybody to see, in formation.
[00:45:24.539 --> 00:45:25.960]  And they're quite large.
[00:45:31.179 --> 00:45:33.679]  Now, those could be military drones.
[00:45:36.199 --> 00:45:45.159]  That's the types that are usually synced like this, and you could have them as a early warning system, a grid to communicate with satellites.
[00:45:45.159 --> 00:45:48.920]  If they think ICBMs are coming in, you can have electromagnetic pulse weapons on them.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.900]  You can have missiles.
[00:45:51.139 --> 00:46:00.500]  You can also, this has been around since the 80s, directed energy weapons from space that then triangulate into the mirrors that are on similar systems.
[00:46:01.019 --> 00:46:02.960]  And I've shown these to you before on air.
[00:46:05.759 --> 00:46:07.340]  The last time I did it was, what, in February?
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:08.260]  We got that footage.
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:09.219]  Maybe you guys can play that.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:10.659]  I don't know if you've got hundreds of clips.
[00:46:12.219 --> 00:46:18.059]  I think the headline was, is NATO preparing a nuclear false flag on Russia?
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:26.039]  And in the report I talk about, Russia supposedly has nuclear-powered lasers in space with the U.S. has had since the 80s, X-ray lasers and others.
[00:46:26.619 --> 00:46:28.480]  And then in that report, I show you some of the original...
[00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:39.210]  Nightline and PBS admissions of this in the late 80s describing these aircraft that go up.
[00:46:39.329 --> 00:46:41.309]  They have mirror arrays.
[00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:42.389]  They angle.
[00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:44.829]  And then the high-powered lasers fire from space.
[00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:47.449]  And then they can direct these where they want.
[00:46:47.809 --> 00:46:50.690]  That would be an advanced anti-ballistic missile defense system.
[00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:56.170]  And I saw a bunch of the people online when I talked about that then and now go, Jones is crazy.
[00:46:56.389 --> 00:46:58.949]  You can't stop Putin's ICBMs.
[00:46:58.969 --> 00:47:05.409]  You can't stop his hypersonic missiles going Mach 11. Really?
[00:47:05.769 --> 00:47:09.110]  Well, they had particle beams in the 80s that could stop ICBMs.
[00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:13.570]  And I'm not saying it would stop them all.
[00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:16.449]  But I've studied the weapons that are public.
[00:47:16.949 --> 00:47:20.869]  I've interviewed the former head of the Star Wars program about 20 times before he died, Dr. Bob Bowman.
[00:47:21.409 --> 00:47:25.869]  I've interviewed many times General Benton K. Parton, the former head of Air Force Weapons Development.
[00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:27.210]  Would you like me to go on?
[00:47:28.429 --> 00:47:34.530]  And at dinner with them and on air, I'd say, I know you can't tell me classified stuff, but I know you can tell me things that they've leaked or admitted.
[00:47:35.389 --> 00:47:36.449]  And they're both on air.
[00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:37.050]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.849]  They like to brag.
[00:47:37.969 --> 00:47:38.369]  They like to leak.
[00:47:38.389 --> 00:47:39.409]  And I can tell you what's been leaked.
[00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:42.550]  And there is the Rods from God.
[00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:44.170]  There's the D.U. Shabo rounds.
[00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:53.250]  There is the autonomous, pull-backed and radio-controlled weapon platforms in space.
[00:47:53.789 --> 00:47:54.750]  So, yeah.
[00:47:56.269 --> 00:48:00.389]  So, there's all sorts of systems.
[00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:03.409]  And you always hear, the U.S. is behind with drones.
[00:48:16.209 --> 00:48:19.150]  And I'm talking to the crew because they got so many clips.
[00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:20.289]  They're not sure which ones I want.
[00:48:20.289 --> 00:48:37.750]  When we go to break to start the next hour, I'll come show you the parts I want to show, folks, of those pinning on illustrations, footage of some of the weapons they had in the 80s.
[00:48:39.199 --> 00:48:40.840]  And then, of course, that's what you're seeing right now.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:45.860]  So there's a lot I haven't gotten to, a lot of angles, a lot of information.
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:46.619]  We're going to go to break.
[00:48:47.239 --> 00:48:48.599]  We're going to start the next hour.
[00:48:48.699 --> 00:48:57.400]  Then I'll talk about the different scenarios they could roll out, what we should be doing, how we respond to this with knowledge and with facts, and so much more.
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:58.619]  But I've only scratched the surface.
[00:48:58.739 --> 00:49:04.619]  I've given you kind of a synopsis, the different angles, the different things happening, and what you're getting is the facts.
[00:49:05.739 --> 00:49:09.639]  Now, Yeah, that's the report.
[00:49:10.519 --> 00:49:11.079]  Exclusive.
[00:49:11.219 --> 00:49:13.719]  Secrets of Russia's space-based nuclear lasers exposed.
[00:49:13.719 --> 00:49:18.340]  Are the Globals planning a nuclear laser EMP false flag to escalate a war with Russia?
[00:49:20.229 --> 00:49:24.010]  And if you watch that report from February, it's like even more powerful now.
[00:49:24.329 --> 00:49:25.289]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:49:25.909 --> 00:49:29.969]  We're going to start Hour 2, then Chase Geyser is loaded for bear from 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:30.190]  tonight.
[00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:32.869]  I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m.
[00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:35.030]  Central for my own regular broadcast.
[00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:36.769]  But this is the Sunday edition.
[00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:37.949]  We're about to go to break.
[00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:39.630]  Please remember, we're funded by you.
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.460]  We want to bring you incredible products so you love them.
[00:49:42.539 --> 00:49:43.340]  They work really well.
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:44.059]  They're incredible.
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:47.320]  Thealexjonesstore.com funds us staying on the air.
[00:49:47.699 --> 00:49:49.039]  Funds the new Alex Jones Network.
[00:49:49.179 --> 00:49:53.940]  If InfoWars gets shut down, I've got major updates, by the way, for you before I end the show tonight on that.
[00:49:54.239 --> 00:49:55.179]  Very good news.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.599]  And extremely good news.
[00:49:58.019 --> 00:50:00.840]  And then, also, they're really great products you want.
[00:50:01.179 --> 00:50:03.420]  Now, this is a product I barely promoted.
[00:50:04.289 --> 00:50:07.889]  Okay, the folks, the great sponsors, the AlexJohnStore.com will get the best supplements.
[00:50:07.889 --> 00:50:08.510]  I knew that.
[00:50:08.889 --> 00:50:10.230]  But everybody's got green drinks.
[00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:11.030]  I love green drinks.
[00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:12.889]  There's a whole bunch of, you know, superfood ones out there.
[00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:17.250]  I had the one I liked the best, and I took the, you know, Kaplan's from Dr. Jesus Naturals that are excellent as well.
[00:50:17.989 --> 00:50:24.929]  But Optimal Human, once I started taking it and reading about it, is the best super green food I've ever taken.
[00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:27.449]  You've heard the rave reviews from Harrison Smith.
[00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:29.329]  Right here on InfoWars.
[00:50:29.989 --> 00:50:31.030]  It is amazing.
[00:50:31.269 --> 00:50:32.789]  All of these key vitamins and minerals.
[00:50:32.909 --> 00:50:37.269]  A whole bunch of concentrated, that's the key word, concentrated superfoods.
[00:50:37.369 --> 00:50:41.070]  And the energy you get from it in 30 minutes is why it's now a bestseller.
[00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:45.010]  But what it does for your whole body, the glowing skin, the health, the immune system is incredible.
[00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:48.909]  Now, they only got a limited amount of this.
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:53.639]  And that's frustrating to me because it's such a good seller.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.940]  It would solve our funding problems if people could get what they wanted.
[00:50:56.019 --> 00:50:59.079]  But it'll be sold out probably in four or five days at current sales rates.
[00:50:59.159 --> 00:51:00.360]  And they claim they're getting more in a month.
[00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:06.659]  But if you want to get Optimal Human, you can get yours right now at thealextownstore.com.
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:11.300]  Also, the superfood, Concentrated Irish Sea Moss.
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.800]  That is the superfood of superfoods.
[00:51:14.639 --> 00:51:17.099]  The gummies are now back in stock, not just the powdered capsules.
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:17.739]  They're amazing.
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:23.460]  TheAlexJonesStore.com and the limited edition Trump on a Stump.
[00:51:23.579 --> 00:51:24.400]  Great Christmas gift.
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:25.320]  Great gift year-round.
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:26.659]  That funds the operation.
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:30.760]  That's at TheAlexJonesStore.com and so many other supplements as well.
[00:51:31.179 --> 00:51:32.300]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[00:51:36.599 --> 00:51:37.420]  Lock up.
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:46.699]  Horseman a drawing nearer!
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.719]  Let us seize a ride!
[00:51:51.879 --> 00:52:01.280]  Dave Mustaine, about 12 years ago, said, I'm doing a new album called Endgame based on your movie, and I want you to help me write it, and I'm doing a new Four Horsemen.
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:08.880]  And I just couldn't believe it, because he wrote Four Horsemen, and a little factoid, and I said, man, it's up to you, you do it.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:13.079]  And the album came out, it was amazing, and he had a Four Horsemen-esque song I wish I would have added to it.
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.860]  A little side issue, a little interesting factoid, how we affect culture here.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:16.780]  Thanks for your support.
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:20.679]  Here's a short clip from my piece I did in February of this year.
[00:52:21.409 --> 00:52:38.070]  Ten months ago on the space-based weapons and mirrors and reflectors on the ground or on aircraft that then the lasers refract off on for better accuracy once they're tracking with the systems, Russian missiles potentially coming in.
[00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:39.050]  And then I got another clip I want to play.
[00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:39.449]  Here it is.
[00:52:40.969 --> 00:52:42.530]  The first response.
[00:52:42.889 --> 00:52:48.489]  Space-based kinetic energy weapons fire high-speed projectiles from hyper-velocity guns.
[00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:52.949]  Intercepting enemy missiles as they are boosted through the atmosphere.
[00:52:54.369 --> 00:53:01.710]  Popped up into space, Earth-based nuclear-powered X-ray lasers fire their radioactive rays.
[00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:10.769]  Attack rays from land-based eczema lasers are redirected by huge mirrors orbiting in space.
[00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:16.210]  Chemical lasers fire beams that burn through the shell of the onrushing missile.
[00:53:19.909 --> 00:53:23.309]  Particle beam weapons with pulsing rays join the attack.
[00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:28.610]  Still over the atmosphere, the missile bus ejects its cargo.
[00:53:29.309 --> 00:53:30.889]  Multiple nuclear warheads.
[00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:40.150]  All right, this is a short segment.
[00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:41.530]  I got more coming up, more details.
[00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:45.809]  But here's a short compilation of the government saying they have no idea what's going on, which is pure crap.
[00:53:45.809 --> 00:53:46.289]  Here it is.
[00:53:47.389 --> 00:53:48.889]  These are not U.S. military drones.
[00:53:49.989 --> 00:53:52.769]  Again, this is being investigated by local law enforcement.
[00:53:53.070 --> 00:54:01.949]  Our initial assessment here is that these are not drones or activities coming from a foreign entity or adversary.
[00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:06.309]  You're telling me we don't know what the hell these drones are in New Jersey are?
[00:54:06.789 --> 00:54:07.610]  Is that correct?
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:09.960]  That's right.
[00:54:10.219 --> 00:54:11.059]  That's crazy.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.239]  I mean, that's crazy.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:15.039]  That's madness that we don't know what these drones are.
[00:54:15.099 --> 00:54:29.340]  From the Coast Guard, who said that one of their 47-foot motor lifeboats was followed by between 12 and 30 of these drones as they went through the water.
[00:54:29.679 --> 00:54:34.219]  These are six-foot drones that are somehow evading our detection.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.760]  They are not being detected.
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.400]  They're saying no threat, but how the hell do they know?
[00:54:37.719 --> 00:54:38.639]  They don't know anything.
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:39.639]  They don't know what it is.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:40.719]  They don't know where it come from.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:41.599]  They don't know nothing.
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:44.179]  They know that they can't track them.
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:46.539]  They know that they don't emit a signal.
[00:54:46.539 --> 00:54:49.380]  They know that they can't see them when they turn their lights out.
[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:52.159]  They also indicated that they don't know where they come from.
[00:54:52.159 --> 00:54:53.539]  They don't know where they go to.
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:55:01.119]  One family claims they followed a drone in their car, and while it hovered above them, the clock in their car changed times.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.380]  Alright, so let's stop there.
[00:55:04.219 --> 00:55:10.360]  There are a lot of advanced technologies in physics that have been developed, and a lot of this is on record.
[00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:13.590]  This is being rolled out.
[00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:19.789]  So you got corporations testing drones, government doing it, government doing drills, corporations testing autonomous AI systems.
[00:55:19.869 --> 00:55:26.130]  And then you've got the really exotic stuff going around to create the fear because we're waking up to the globalists.
[00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:29.869]  We're waking up to the breakaway civilization who want back control of our country and our destiny.
[00:55:29.949 --> 00:55:32.010]  And they're like, oh yeah, take a look at this.
[00:55:32.269 --> 00:55:33.530]  We don't know what it is.
[00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:34.590]  We don't know where it came from.
[00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:35.550]  We don't know what's going on.
[00:55:37.489 --> 00:55:38.349]  This is disgusting.
[00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:43.809]  But this is everything we talk about and what we expose, and we decentralize this information.
[00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:49.429]  It is Sunday, December 15, 2024. Have you shared the live link from Real Alex Jones?
[00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:52.590]  Because when you do that, that's what changes the world.
[00:55:52.809 --> 00:55:53.590]  Do it now.
[00:55:53.969 --> 00:55:54.829]  Back in 60 seconds.
[00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:57.949]  Finally, nothing moves.
[00:55:59.170 --> 00:56:00.090]  High news.
[00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:01.610]  Blackout.
[00:56:05.679 --> 00:56:14.500]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:56:15.519 --> 00:56:21.559]  And now you know why I cut that liner, had that liner made, that was like 16 years old.
[00:56:23.289 --> 00:56:25.530]  Broadcasting from FEMA Region 6?
[00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:26.530]  Why does he say Texas?
[00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:42.809]  Well, I want to get you thinking about FEMA and a COG NORTHCOM takeover that they could use, under federal law, an unidentified flying object or UAP, UAV threat to trigger that just removes Congress,
[00:56:42.929 --> 00:56:43.630]  the President, everything.
[00:56:44.489 --> 00:56:53.440]  In the last hour, I showed you those documents, those laws, 2007. Did a deep dive with great journalists who's written for the Wall Street Journal, you name it.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:57:08.519]  Daniel List, Friday, the UAP UFO invasion may be used to trigger NORTHCOM's continuity of government, national emergency powers to stop Trump or derail him like the COVID release did five years ago.
[00:57:10.599 --> 00:57:12.039]  So that's where we are.
[00:57:12.139 --> 00:57:15.159]  And if you listen to Kirby and all of them, they just say this over and over again.
[00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:19.190]  Federal government, NORTHCOMM, DOD, Justice Department.
[00:57:19.329 --> 00:57:20.849]  We don't know who's sending the drones.
[00:57:20.849 --> 00:57:22.510]  We don't know who owns the drones.
[00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:31.969]  We don't know what the drones are doing in the air, in our airspace, but we know that they're not a threat to anybody and they don't pose a threat.
[00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:35.349]  That is a logical scientific fallacy.
[00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:38.889]  And President Trump said mystery drone sightings all over the country.
[00:57:39.679 --> 00:57:43.000]  Can this really be happening without our government's knowledge?
[00:57:43.539 --> 00:57:44.780]  I don't think so.
[00:57:45.159 --> 00:57:46.860]  Let the public know and now.
[00:57:47.039 --> 00:57:48.320]  Otherwise, shoot them down.
[00:57:49.039 --> 00:57:51.360]  Elon Musk got asked about it months ago when he was in Phoenix.
[00:57:52.099 --> 00:57:59.760]  And he said, I don't know the specifics, but I know there's a lot of stuff the public hasn't been given access to and it should be decentralized and made public.
[00:58:00.059 --> 00:58:00.340]  Yeah.
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:03.699]  Here, let's hear from Elon Musk on that.
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:04.219]  Here it is.
[00:58:06.099 --> 00:58:25.539]  As somebody who is directly involved in the pioneering of space travel, what is your perspective on the suppression of advanced technologies under UAP crash retrieval programs and other black projects such as Immaculate Constellation that have the potential to fundamentally change human society?
[00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:38.110]  I'm not familiar with those programs, but I mean, I certainly think if there are technologies that can be helpful, the government's aware of it, we should obviously provide that technology to the people.
[00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:44.269]  So I should say that, you know, people often ask me, you know, do I believe in aliens?
[00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:54.469]  And I said, well, I was one, you know, according to Homeland Security until I got my, you know, it literally said alien registration card.
[00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:55.309]  I'm like, cool.
[00:58:59.439 --> 00:59:05.239]  So, I mean, thus far, I'm not aware of any evidence for aliens on Earth.
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:09.360]  I'm not saying they're not here, but I have not seen any evidence for aliens.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:17.360]  And for our Starlink constellation, we have never had to maneuver around an alien spacecraft, even once.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:20.119]  And we've got 6,000 satellites up there.
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:24.980]  So, I mean, they're very subtle, is what I'm saying, these aliens, you know.
[00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:39.989]  But I think if there's like, I don't know, if there's interesting stuff that the government's aware of that American people would find interesting or useful, we should obviously make that known.
[00:59:39.989 --> 00:59:41.030]  We should publish it.
[00:59:41.389 --> 00:59:46.670]  That is interesting because we see these live feeds out of the SpaceX operations.
[00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:49.150]  We don't see what NASA's shown so many times.
[00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:50.869]  Did NASA fake this stuff?
[00:59:50.889 --> 00:59:51.650]  Doesn't look fake.
[00:59:51.869 --> 00:59:53.449]  See, the moon landing does look fake.
[00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:55.230]  We've got serious problems with this type of stuff.
[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:58.719]  With white orbs decades ago coming up to the space station.
[01:00:00.099 --> 01:00:13.460]  And that makes me, you know, think back to the hundreds of videos I've seen from NASA and also private corporate satellites at distance showing these things that, you know, Mach 50 coming up from the Earth, going back in the atmosphere, flying around.
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.500]  I mean, there's a lot of weirdness going on.
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:24.739]  But the stuff you're seeing over the U.S. and the rest of it with the flashing lights and shooting tracers and knocking other drones down, that's human.
[01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:28.409]  And why are they creating hysteria?
[01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:31.869]  Here's some memes I thought were informative and thought-provoking.
[01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:32.730]  We get an overhead shot.
[01:00:36.469 --> 01:00:40.789]  I swear the drones are a distraction from what is really happening in America.
[01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:44.829]  I'm not sure what to think on those drones, said this lady.
[01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:50.369]  Sassafras 84. And it's Dr. Evil saying, Trump's going to release the Epstein client list.
[01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:51.769]  Release the drones!
[01:00:52.469 --> 01:00:53.309]  Here's another one.
[01:00:54.329 --> 01:00:56.210]  What are the drones being used to distract us from?
[01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:57.550]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[01:00:58.170 --> 01:01:08.889]  And of course, back on Larry King Live decades ago, astronauts, reporters, talking about orbs showing up in Russia, the UK, France, the US over nuke bases and disarming them.
[01:01:08.989 --> 01:01:10.690]  That's been reported by Congress to Congress.
[01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:12.809]  And it goes on and on.
[01:01:12.909 --> 01:01:15.309]  But it's definitely distracting us from heartbreaking.
[01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:21.929]  Biden lets out the judge that would steal people's children if they didn't pay him cash.
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:28.320]  So, Mike Adams had some really good statements on this.
[01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:06.849]  Wow, couldn't say it that good.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.280]  Then you've got the state officials and governors and everybody.
[01:02:11.619 --> 01:02:12.780]  Oh, and the representatives.
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:13.659]  Oh, we're pissed.
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:14.500]  We don't know what they are.
[01:02:14.639 --> 01:02:15.579]  They're attacking us.
[01:02:15.699 --> 01:02:16.460]  It's an invasion.
[01:02:17.099 --> 01:02:18.880]  Massive invasion of drones, close quote.
[01:02:20.739 --> 01:02:21.900]  They're shooting tracers.
[01:02:22.039 --> 01:02:22.800]  They're flying around.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:23.760]  Or these reports.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:27.800]  Oh, no, they're really protecting us from the Russian nukes that they smuggled in.
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:31.179]  So when they detonate one of those, well, people believe it's that.
[01:02:33.219 --> 01:02:35.400]  Meanwhile, they don't want us to look at this.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.280]  California kept its election going over a month.
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:50.440]  They stole a few seats clearly, but now that California has finally finished counting votes, here's the final chart of the unprecedented shift towards Trump versus 2020, overriding even a lot of the fraud in California.
[01:02:52.159 --> 01:03:00.940]  Meanwhile, you do have the government agencies and corporate groups that monitor radiation levels for monitors reporting unprecedented radiation levels in New York City.
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.179]  A lot of craziness going on.
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:06.440]  All right.
[01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:12.530]  I have a lot of other angles I haven't hit yet and some summations.
[01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:23.590]  And I also want to talk about what I believe is coming next from the different tracks, different competing bureaucracies and corporations that are piling onto this.
[01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:30.869]  But we know at the top, the executive branch and the whole shadow government system, this whole scare was greenlit.
[01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:48.230]  And at the heart of it is, and I'll show you these articles and documents, is the authorization a year ago, For drones to operate at night, private ones, and then people see something that's not on nefarious missions and get scared by that, and people see passenger planes and get scared by that and that intensifies the hysteria.
[01:03:48.409 --> 01:03:57.969]  And then five years ago, New Jersey became one of the main testing grounds in populated areas for commercial drone and government testing using AI and other mapping systems.
[01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:04.949]  So the bureaucracy just bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, throws a few switches, and then people see all this and get really scared.
[01:04:06.079 --> 01:04:09.599]  And then the government tells you nothing's going on to not give you answers.
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:13.260]  And so it even gets more insane from there.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.679]  Now there's an excellent report.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:15.820]  It's only 12 minutes long.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.199]  I'm going to repost on my ex-channel, Real Alex Jones.
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.780]  In fact, I'll do it while I'm airing this.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.420]  I forgot to do it.
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:25.340]  This is from TPP News.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:34.139]  Gates Insider admits war drones are spraying chemicals over America, and Gates does this all over the place and releases mosquitoes using aircraft and drones.
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:37.380]  This is all actually hiding in plain view, and we have whistleblowers.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:39.780]  This is an excellent report, not just on Gates, but...
[01:04:40.489 --> 01:04:42.789]  A lot of angles and clips I was already planning to play today.
[01:04:42.989 --> 01:04:45.610]  And I went, wow, they did a great job boiling it all down better than I could.
[01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:46.309]  Really.
[01:04:46.570 --> 01:04:48.670]  And so, here it is.
[01:04:48.730 --> 01:04:49.690]  And I'll be back with more.
[01:04:50.599 --> 01:04:56.260]  The overwhelming public outcry has finally forced the mainstream media to acknowledge the scandal they've long ignored.
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:01.139]  Mysterious drones in the sky attacking America and its citizens.
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:02.420]  But don't be fooled.
[01:05:02.679 --> 01:05:04.579]  They're still not telling you the full story.
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.739]  They're avoiding the critical questions.
[01:05:07.199 --> 01:05:10.119]  What sinister missions are these drones carrying out?
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:14.460]  Why is the media ignoring the fact that drones are spraying chemicals?
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:18.079]  And who are the shadowy figures pulling the strings behind the scenes?
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:25.380]  Thanks to some seriously good investigative work from the TPV community and our partners, we've got the answers they are working hard to cover up.
[01:05:25.579 --> 01:05:26.400]  Stick around.
[01:05:26.719 --> 01:05:28.400]  The details are coming up next.
[01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:37.010]  Reports of mysterious drones swarming the skies over military installations, law enforcement sites and densely populated urban centres are causing a nationwide frenzy.
[01:05:37.289 --> 01:05:46.530]  Sightings of up to 50 drones at once have been documented in various locations, including off the coast of New Jersey, leaving the public and low-level officials scrambling for answers.
[01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:52.010]  One of their officers called 911 after seeing 50 of them come off the ocean.
[01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:57.070]  Advised after we made contact with that officer that there were 50 that came off the ocean.
[01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:57.590]  50?
[01:05:57.869 --> 01:05:58.570]  5-0.
[01:05:58.730 --> 01:05:59.989]  That was my reaction also.
[01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:02.409]  There were 50 that were coming off the ocean.
[01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:04.630]  And this is a sworn officer?
[01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:06.150]  A sworn officer, yes.
[01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:10.289]  We contacted state police, we contacted the FBI, we contacted the Coast Guard.
[01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:16.469]  The Coast Guard, at which point the Coast Guard went out with their boat, and they reported seeing 13 following their boat.
[01:06:16.849 --> 01:06:22.190]  And then the Coast Guard also advised that they went over them about 300 feet and had a wingspan of about 8 feet.
[01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:27.050]  You know, the Ocean County Sheriff, that drone unit, they have an industrial-grade drone.
[01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:27.730]  They put it up.
[01:06:27.769 --> 01:06:34.590]  They were tracking one of these drones, Elizabeth, and they said this thing easily evaded them, disappeared out of thin air.
[01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:41.530]  So, you know, to me, if this is not our military, then it's even more scary and we need answers, frankly.
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:47.300]  According to Biden's Homeland Security Secretary, the federal government doesn't have a clue what's going on.
[01:06:47.719 --> 01:06:48.739]  But don't worry, they say.
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.380]  The drones aren't a threat.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:51.260]  Huh?
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:56.940]  Apparently, the FBI can figure out if a grandfather took a selfie in the Capitol building more than four years ago.
[01:06:57.139 --> 01:07:01.880]  But they can't figure out who is flying a fleet of attack drones over New Jersey as we speak.
[01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:14.829]  This is the same government that lied to you about the Chinese spy balloon, COVID, inflation, the Nord Stream pipeline, and Biden's cognitive decline and gaslit the public on nearly every major issue for the past four years.
[01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:19.210]  Are we really supposed to believe they're suddenly telling the full truth about these drones?
[01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:32.010]  Former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan saw large drones in the sky above his Davidsonville home, located roughly 25 miles from Washington DC, and called for the federal government to immediately address the issue.
[01:07:32.269 --> 01:07:40.030]  Democrat representatives and media pundits are scrambling to spin the phenomenon, but it's painfully obvious they have no clue what's really going on.
[01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:43.269]  Their analysis is as scattered as the drones themselves.
[01:07:43.989 --> 01:07:59.969]  Clearly, there's something going on out there, and what's driving me crazy, and I think a lot of my colleagues in the state government, and of course federally, is that the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, who are chiefly responsible for monitoring and being aware of what's up in the skies,
[01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:10.949]  is not giving us a public briefing, giving us enough information, telling us exactly where these drones are coming from, who's sending them up, you know, are they all unlicensed and unregistered, what are they?
[01:08:11.139 --> 01:08:18.760]  And I think people deserve to know, which is why, of course, when you don't have any information, people get rightly anxious about it and say, what's going on out here?
[01:08:18.979 --> 01:08:19.960]  Give me some information.
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:34.880]  And so I've called on the FBI to immediately, with DHS, brief the country, brief New Jersey, what's going on, make public what they know, and of course, ensure that state and local law enforcement Have the tools they need from a monitoring perspective.
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:49.779]  And if necessary, if these drones are going over military bases like they have been reported in New Jersey or over critical infrastructure like reservoirs or national security sites or other law enforcement sites, that law enforcement has the tools to take out and take down these drones.
[01:08:50.239 --> 01:09:03.239]  Are you surprised that the law enforcement agencies, like the FBI, like DHS, like the Pentagon, that have all come out and tried to say nothing to worry about?
[01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:04.819]  I'm paraphrasing that.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:17.979]  I think they're direct words where there's no national security or public safety threat, no evidence of that threat, and that there's no evidence of a nexus to some kind of foreign impetus or influence in this.
[01:09:18.539 --> 01:09:21.699]  I mean, are you surprised, though, that they can't say, this is what's happening?
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:22.720]  This is what...
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.380]  Do they not have the answers?
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:31.960]  The reason these drones aren't being intercepted, even when they fly over military installations and law enforcement sites, is no accident.
[01:09:32.659 --> 01:09:40.500]  Insiders claim these agencies have been explicitly instructed to stand down, allowing the drones to carry out their shadowy, nefarious activities unchecked.
[01:09:40.619 --> 01:09:41.399]  Let's be real.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:45.579]  If they truly wanted to catch these drones, they could do it without breaking a sweat.
[01:09:46.079 --> 01:09:53.460]  Other countries have no problem intercepting or disabling unauthorized drones, using advanced detection systems and drone jammers.
[01:09:53.779 --> 01:09:57.439]  There are no fancy light shows by federal governments for national security theater.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.619]  The drones simply glide down quietly and efficiently.
[01:10:01.199 --> 01:10:05.140]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:17.840]  I'm good to go.
[01:10:28.699 --> 01:10:39.420]  The decision to allow the drones to continue enjoying the freedom of disguise raises troubling questions about who is truly behind these mysterious drones and why such a hands-off approach is being enforced.
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:46.199]  Are these government agencies complicit or are they under pressure from higher powers to turn a blind eye?
[01:10:46.539 --> 01:10:48.579]  The answers might surprise you.
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:59.500]  The elites have no intention of revealing the truth about the drones, even though we are gathering evidence that completely obliterates their ongoing denials about outright lies about the phenomenon.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.180]  The truth is clear.
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:07.619]  The government's complicity is undeniable, and their motives for keeping us in the dark are as predictable as ever.
[01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:09.489]  But here's the twist.
[01:11:09.829 --> 01:11:10.989]  There's always a catch.
[01:11:11.210 --> 01:11:14.430]  And it's far darker than almost anyone realises.
[01:11:14.710 --> 01:11:18.329]  You're telling me we don't know what the hell these drones are in New Jersey?
[01:11:18.449 --> 01:11:18.670]  That's right.
[01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:19.810]  It's crazy.
[01:11:20.029 --> 01:11:21.949]  What's going on in New Jersey?
[01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:23.649]  These are not US military drones.
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.279]  So since they won't tell you, I'll have to.
[01:11:26.659 --> 01:11:37.619]  DPA Title III. The DPA was revived under Trump to ensure that things like drones, technology, and medical supplies were being produced in the U.S. so that we could move away from Chinese-produced technology.
[01:11:37.619 --> 01:11:40.539]  This led to two Department of Defense drone programs.
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:45.319]  The Blue UAS, Unmanned Aircraft System, and the Replicator Program.
[01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:55.350]  It also led to the Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act, which allotted $200 million, half to creating drone infrastructure and half to training people in drones.
[01:11:55.609 --> 01:12:08.949]  And it just so happens that in 2023, an agreement was made which established a testing corridor between New Jersey and Delaware to allow safe trials of these new technologies, specifically to see how these could work in real life scenarios.
[01:12:09.479 --> 01:12:12.579]  Okay, so right here we see a map of where all the drones have been spotted.
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.340]  And here is a map of all the military bases in New Jersey.
[01:12:16.579 --> 01:12:19.859]  Here's some examples of some of the drones that could be flying over this area.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.439]  Could have a wingspan of four meters, seven meters, which is about 22 feet.
[01:12:24.619 --> 01:12:26.960]  Goes along with some of the claims that people have been making.
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:31.739]  Now, as we can see, the designated corridor for the drone testing is in South Jersey.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.039]  So let's explore maybe some of the reasons that we might be seeing them in North Jersey.
[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:38.279]  We see that they've been seen over the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster.
[01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:43.210]  But we know that during his presidency, he spent 104 days at the golf course.
[01:12:43.229 --> 01:12:51.489]  And it's already been stated that the Replicator Program has a goal to field thousands of drones by August 2025. Okay, so what are these drones doing?
[01:12:51.770 --> 01:13:00.649]  One might be testing counter drone systems, ISR, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, AI navigation development.
[01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:04.210]  This is why we're seeing it over urban and suburban areas.
[01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:07.829]  Okay, so why is the government acting like they don't know what's going on?
[01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:16.770]  Well, one, we know the government is so compartmentalized, and the left hand never knows what the right hand is doing, and that federal, local, and military don't communicate with each other at all.
[01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:31.989]  We also know that this is companies' private sector behind this, which is being funded by the DOD, which is why they're saying it's not the government, because technically there's 30 contracts and over 50 subcontracts, including Anduril Industries and General Atomics,
[01:13:32.329 --> 01:13:33.670]  as well as Skydio.
[01:13:33.949 --> 01:13:35.989]  Now, of course, we know why the media is playing it up.
[01:13:36.170 --> 01:13:39.430]  The election is over and they have to keep the lights on, so let's talk about aliens.
[01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:45.170]  But the fact that the government continues to deny it could be because they enjoy having an invisible threat.
[01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:47.850]  They love to blame the foreign adversaries.
[01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:51.970]  But if it was actually a foreign country, they would not be allowed to fly that low.
[01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:56.869]  It would justify surveillance, profit from fear, and of course it could be a distraction.
[01:13:57.210 --> 01:14:01.590]  There's also been a lot of emphasis on government efficiency coming from Elon Musk.
[01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:12.949]  He has endorsed drone warfare over manned fighter jets, saying they're more cost effective, less human casualty, and the ability to maneuver and accelerate in a way that human pilots could never.
[01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:16.550]  So trust me, I want this to be aliens more than you do, okay?
[01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:19.649]  But shocker, the government is lying to you once again.
[01:14:20.939 --> 01:14:27.659]  According to a Gates Foundation insider, these reports are on the money regarding the DoD involvement, but they don't go far enough.
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:31.840]  These drones are not simply training for future warfare or surveilling the population.
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:41.720]  The drones are spraying a concoction of chemicals on the masses, targeting urban centres and military installations, and preparing to expand their activities across the nation.
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.159]  Alright, listen up.
[01:14:43.319 --> 01:14:46.659]  Cause this is straight out of Jersey and it's eaten me alive.
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.199]  I've been working at the Gates Foundation.
[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:51.060]  Yeah, that Gates Foundation.
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:55.479]  The one that acts all high and mighty about humanitarian work.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:58.239]  Let me tell you, it's all a loadable.
[01:14:58.899 --> 01:15:00.000]  What I've seen there.
[01:15:01.069 --> 01:15:02.529]  It's enough to make your skin crawl.
[01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:06.390]  Those drones you keep hearing about, they ain't just flying around for kicks.
[01:15:06.609 --> 01:15:09.470]  This is a DOD operation, and we're in on it.
[01:15:09.789 --> 01:15:14.149]  They're spraying some engineered toxic cocktail over key spots on the East Coast.
[01:15:14.369 --> 01:15:17.210]  And let me tell you, they're gearing up to take it national.
[01:15:17.569 --> 01:15:19.369]  This ain't some overseas war.
[01:15:19.529 --> 01:15:20.689]  It's right here at home.
[01:15:20.829 --> 01:15:23.770]  It's warfare against the American people, plain and simple.
[01:15:23.970 --> 01:15:28.909]  But instead of bullets and bombs, it's silent, sneaky, and right in your face.
[01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:30.350]  Those chemicals?
[01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:34.149]  They're messing with your head, your mood, your focus.
[01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:41.550]  They're putting people in a fog, making them zoned out, confused, and too distracted to notice or fight back.
[01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:43.289]  Grocery store?
[01:15:43.569 --> 01:15:44.250]  Forget it.
[01:15:44.489 --> 01:15:45.989]  People walking around like zombies.
[01:15:46.829 --> 01:15:47.430]  Roads?
[01:15:47.649 --> 01:15:51.189]  Either they're driving like lunatics or slow as molasses.
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.340]  It's the same everywhere.
[01:15:53.619 --> 01:15:55.720]  Cities, small towns, even military bases.
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:16:00.899]  The excuse we get at the Foundation is it's all for environmental monitoring or disease prevention.
[01:16:01.239 --> 01:16:01.960]  Yeah, sure.
[01:16:02.399 --> 01:16:03.319]  And I'm the Pope.
[01:16:03.699 --> 01:16:04.640]  The real deal?
[01:16:04.779 --> 01:16:10.560]  They're spreading a slow-acting disease and messing with your mind to create a population that's too docile to resist.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:17.479]  I've been seeing this since 2021. It's like something flipped, and suddenly everyone's walking around like they're in a daze.
[01:16:17.659 --> 01:16:19.039]  I know who's behind it.
[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:21.079]  And believe me, it's way bigger than you'd think.
[01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:24.890]  The Gates Foundation is just one piece of the puzzle, but they're neck deep in it.
[01:16:25.170 --> 01:16:29.970]  I tried to warn my colleagues, tried to tell them we're the bad guys in this story, but they're all in.
[01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:31.329]  They don't care.
[01:16:31.609 --> 01:16:35.250]  So now I'm speaking up, because people got to know what's going on before it's too late.
[01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:38.630]  This ain't paranoia, and it sure as hell ain't some crazy conspiracy.
[01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:39.649]  All right, let's stop right there.
[01:16:39.729 --> 01:16:41.449]  There's more of the report I'm posting in OnX.
[01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:48.090]  We'll post it in post tonight when I post the full show after we're not live at Infowars.com and Bandot Video and Real Alex Jones.
[01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:49.069]  But let me just say this quickly.
[01:16:50.029 --> 01:16:56.529]  What do you think Bill Gates' mRNA shot was and how it's causing blood clots and brain damage to everybody and infertility and heart attacks?
[01:16:56.710 --> 01:16:57.489]  They're doing it.
[01:16:57.529 --> 01:17:00.689]  He released deadly mosquitoes all over the world, including all over the U.S. Yeah.
[01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:05.489]  He's got these aircraft and drones on record with their little secret payloads.
[01:17:05.529 --> 01:17:06.189]  So that's part of it.
[01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.850]  We're going to go to break.
[01:17:08.010 --> 01:17:11.409]  I got a ton more news on this, how we should counter it more.
[01:17:11.649 --> 01:17:16.350]  But remember, it's our sponsors that keep us on air, plus the products are incredible.

[01:18:36.399 --> 01:18:44.560]  It's all available that I mentioned and more at drjones, drjonesnaturals.com, and it finances the global awakening.
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:45.239]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:45.319 --> 01:18:45.859]  Stay with us.
[01:18:50.770 --> 01:18:55.550]  Alright, we are one hour and 33 minutes into this live Sunday transmission.
[01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:57.590]  I've got about 26 and a half minutes left.
[01:18:58.229 --> 01:19:02.250]  And then Chase guys are always knocks it out of the park for Sunday Night Live, 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:19:02.329 --> 01:19:02.609]  Central.
[01:19:02.989 --> 01:19:04.310]  He'll be covering the waterfront.
[01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:08.909]  There's a lot of other political news and developments and things I want to hit briefly as well.
[01:19:08.949 --> 01:19:11.609]  It's all extremely informative and interesting and thought-provoking.
[01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:17.729]  But I wanted to sum up the situation taking place.
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:28.760]  With this exponential increase in what's being billed as this UFO, UAP, UAV invasion.
[01:19:30.489 --> 01:19:37.250]  Now, I put the show headline out an hour and a half ago when we started going live that we've solved what's happening in New Jersey and New York.
[01:19:37.710 --> 01:19:50.430]  We have not solved the whole history of UFOs and every ancient culture describing these crafts and what's in the hieroglyphs and the Aztec paintings and all the rest of it, and in cave drawings of Neanderthal.
[01:19:51.729 --> 01:19:54.649]  But almost all of this is human craft.
[01:19:54.649 --> 01:20:02.560]  If you just look up New Jersey, Commercial drone testing system.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.619]  They authorized five years ago to be one of the main places where they can test drones.
[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:09.819]  You get a license to do that in commercial areas.
[01:20:11.399 --> 01:20:15.260]  And it's one of the main centers for that in a built-up area.
[01:20:16.979 --> 01:20:19.060]  So then people wonder what the hell's going on.
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:21.520]  This is the new big industry.
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:26.300]  One of the new big industries like AI is robotic air delivery of things.
[01:20:27.670 --> 01:20:33.409]  Air Taxi is the big air taxi company that's got a lot of big funding is based there.
[01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:34.949]  They're doing their testing there.
[01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:36.310]  I've seen footage in the day.
[01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:38.210]  You can see, well, there's their air taxi.
[01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:38.789]  You can look it up.
[01:20:38.869 --> 01:20:39.630]  It's their air taxi.
[01:20:40.329 --> 01:20:42.449]  And people look at this and go, what the hell is that?
[01:20:42.609 --> 01:20:44.390]  And the government goes, we don't know.
[01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:45.510]  We don't understand.
[01:20:46.529 --> 01:20:49.890]  But clearly, clip 47, I want to play that again with audio.
[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:53.060]  It's about seven days old now.
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:21:03.239]  It came out last Sunday, actually, of aircraft flying like jets very fast and then all stopping in position.
[01:21:03.399 --> 01:21:05.800]  And they look very sophisticated, very fast.
[01:21:05.979 --> 01:21:06.819]  They're coordinated.
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:09.359]  And that looks like the government to me.
[01:21:09.479 --> 01:21:11.659]  That looks like Air Force hardware to me.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:16.960]  And we know they've got a whole lot of different systems and things that do that.
[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:17.399]  So...
[01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:19.670]  Why is this being done?
[01:21:19.869 --> 01:21:23.930]  Well, to distract from all the other political things that are happening that discredit the system.
[01:21:24.609 --> 01:21:29.590]  They're also trying to pass a bunch of restrictions on the civilians and drones right now.
[01:21:30.949 --> 01:21:33.850]  They're also hyping up that nukes could be on the East Coast.
[01:21:33.970 --> 01:21:39.250]  So if one goes off to derail the Trump agenda or maybe even kill Trump if he's in the area, they can say, well, we tried to protect you.
[01:21:39.329 --> 01:21:59.979]  I mean, there's a lot of ominous stuff, but then you get enough drone activity they can institute under the 2007 law, and this is the big point, The continuity of government programs that Dick Cheney got into the regulations and then Congress funded for the regional governors of FEMA to take control and even suspend Congress and the power of the presidency for a time.
[01:22:00.119 --> 01:22:01.520]  And we did the deep dive on that Friday.
[01:22:01.859 --> 01:22:08.220]  The UAP UFO invasion may be used to trigger NORTHCOM's continuity of government national emergency powers to stop Trump.
[01:22:08.939 --> 01:22:11.539]  Here's the directive on national continuity policy.
[01:22:12.659 --> 01:22:17.220]  May 4, 2007, and then pick up all the laws in Congress and the rest of it.
[01:22:17.319 --> 01:22:20.979]  So I'm showing you the receipts here.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.479]  And then we get headlines like this.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:27.399]  Dirty bomb or nuclear war headed in the USA. Drone mystery could be covered.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.779]  Operation searching for devices.
[01:22:30.039 --> 01:22:31.000]  Infowars.com.
[01:22:31.869 --> 01:22:32.750]  Here's Zero Hedge.
[01:22:32.869 --> 01:22:33.409]  Similar article.
[01:22:33.569 --> 01:22:34.350]  New theory.
[01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:41.270]  New Jersey drone sightings could be nuclear sniffers following elevated New York City radiation levels.
[01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:52.350]  According to all my sources and a lot of others that are public that are respected, I can tell you on very good authority there are much more discreet and effective ways that we monitor and search for radioactive nuclear material.
[01:22:53.670 --> 01:23:01.470]  Source counter, WMD, has a significant part of my job as a Navy EOD officer was working for the task force.
[01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:04.649]  And I know other folks did that as well that have told me the same thing.
[01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:11.210]  So I've run down every angle of this, and I'm still thinking of new ones every day, and I run those down.
[01:23:12.210 --> 01:23:19.310]  But you've got very advanced drones that civilians don't have access to unless it's a big corporation.
[01:23:21.010 --> 01:23:22.729]  Constantly harassing military bases.
[01:23:22.869 --> 01:23:25.250]  The military bases are compartmentalized as well.
[01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:26.409]  They don't know what's going on.
[01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:29.729]  And I see articles like this about 50 times a day without even looking.
[01:23:29.869 --> 01:23:30.449]  They're just everywhere.
[01:23:30.630 --> 01:23:31.270]  You see them too.
[01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:32.050]  Look at this.
[01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:35.810]  Mysterious drone in New York State paralyzes airport operations.
[01:23:35.970 --> 01:23:38.229]  This has gone too far, says Governor Hochul.
[01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:44.590]  And then Thursday night, a plane going over between New York and...
[01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:54.880]  The main city there in New Jersey, Trenton, and they say a bird flew in the engine and you slow it down and look at it, it looks like a drone.
[01:23:55.119 --> 01:23:56.659]  It's got right angles.
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.319]  It doesn't look like any bird I've ever seen.
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:04.640]  And then we're supposed to know that the sheriffs have the answers because the feds won't give answers.
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:05.340]  Well, they don't know.
[01:24:05.439 --> 01:24:07.319]  They just know it's advanced and a whole bunch of them.
[01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:10.189]  That they're seeing.
[01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:11.649]  Watch.
[01:24:11.789 --> 01:24:16.689]  Sheriff says 50 mysterious drones spotted coming off the shore before they vanished into thin air.
[01:24:17.409 --> 01:24:19.010]  Well, yeah, they turn their lights off.
[01:24:19.649 --> 01:24:26.250]  New Jersey mayor officials warned us to call bomb squad and we're hazmat if drone crashes like it's an attack.
[01:24:26.710 --> 01:24:30.970]  So the feds are sending all of these mixed messages.
[01:24:31.289 --> 01:24:35.050]  DHS Secretary of Marquez downplays drone sightings, says feds can't shoot them down.
[01:24:36.130 --> 01:24:38.869]  Because, quote, there's a law that lets other people fly to their own seat.
[01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:56.890]  So this is all about hysteria, all about fear, all about distractions, and about getting laws passed that are introduced that I showed you earlier to not let anybody have private drones unless you're big select corporations, and the government's selling up markets,
[01:24:57.130 --> 01:25:00.310]  creating monopolies just like Elon has been exposing with OpenAI.
[01:25:01.869 --> 01:25:02.390]  And...
[01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:07.890]  Others who've been in the meetings and they're like, yeah, we're going to create a monopoly.
[01:25:08.170 --> 01:25:09.050]  That's really going to be run by the government.
[01:25:10.289 --> 01:25:13.069]  So we need Trump to get really informed on this.
[01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:18.329]  If you talk about solutions, we need the governors and the legislatures to be informed.
[01:25:20.690 --> 01:25:25.550]  The knowledge curve of people in government and the general public has to go up.
[01:25:25.630 --> 01:25:32.010]  I mean, I remember being in Congress just six years ago, the famous footage of me confronting Sundar Pichai, the head of Google.
[01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:33.550]  He was showing up to testify.
[01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:35.569]  And I was attacked in the hearings.
[01:25:35.970 --> 01:25:37.909]  That's why I was in D.C., but they wouldn't let me testify.
[01:25:39.489 --> 01:25:40.869]  And I said, hey, Google's evil.
[01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:41.550]  You're a liar.
[01:25:42.210 --> 01:25:46.250]  You're giving your AI to the communist Chinese, but not the U.S. That's even crazier.
[01:25:47.010 --> 01:25:48.729]  Bad enough to have the U.S. government monopolize it.
[01:25:48.729 --> 01:25:50.109]  I'm against that, but it was going to be China.
[01:25:54.010 --> 01:26:10.250]  And he got up there again at the hearing, and the congressman was like, now, my granddaughter can find clips of me on here that I didn't really say, and I hear this Googler can track where I go and what I do.
[01:26:10.289 --> 01:26:12.250]  And he goes, no, sir, chairman.
[01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:14.890]  We've played the clips a hundred times or more.
[01:26:15.409 --> 01:26:16.630]  And they've done it over and over again.
[01:26:16.729 --> 01:26:18.810]  I mean, I've seen them for 20 years, the congressman going...
[01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:20.920]  It's one of the dumb questions I always ask.
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:24.000]  Well, I hear this tracks me where I am and where I go.
[01:26:25.579 --> 01:26:26.899]  And they're like, no, no, no.
[01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:29.520]  Well, no, that's an app that does it on Google, not Google.
[01:26:29.659 --> 01:26:31.300]  See, they play these games.
[01:26:32.619 --> 01:26:38.239]  So, Congress can't even understand that their GPS tracked.
[01:26:39.859 --> 01:26:43.880]  You know, when they put the address in where they're going and it tracks you in live time and you're the little blue bubble on there.
[01:26:45.619 --> 01:26:50.689]  So, Most of Congress is even more ignorant of the public about this.
[01:26:50.850 --> 01:26:54.149]  And so now all these drones are increasing and they're being rolled out commercially.
[01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:57.250]  And they're like, well, why just roll them out and let them know we're doing it?
[01:26:57.289 --> 01:27:04.489]  No, it'll be in the paperwork, it's official, but we'll just play dumb, scare everybody, and pass a law to restrict everybody but a few corporations in the government.
[01:27:06.210 --> 01:27:10.970]  And it's the same story over and over and over again.
[01:27:10.989 --> 01:27:13.510]  And I have sat there in Congress, and I just watched the clips.
[01:27:15.670 --> 01:27:18.250]  And I haven't seen this in a few years, so finally they know that's a dumb question.
[01:27:18.670 --> 01:27:20.569]  Now, is this thing tracking me?
[01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:24.750]  Well, no, so your phone doesn't track you, because technically it's not the phone, it's the program.
[01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:28.750]  It's crazy.
[01:27:30.489 --> 01:27:31.029]  How's that?
[01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:32.390]  What does it do?
[01:27:34.210 --> 01:27:45.229]  You know, it's like watching a caveman be given a cell phone that's really a supercomputer with all these different functions, and It's the same thing they do.
[01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:46.850]  Like, there's no such thing as chemtrails.
[01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:51.189]  Well, yeah, because no one in the scientific arena calls it a chemtrail.
[01:27:51.390 --> 01:27:52.529]  It's geoengineering.
[01:27:52.649 --> 01:27:53.270]  It's terraforming.
[01:27:53.409 --> 01:27:55.649]  It's high-altitude aerosol campaigns.
[01:27:55.829 --> 01:27:56.670]  That's all admitted.
[01:27:57.189 --> 01:28:03.729]  So they'll have NBC News, ABC News, Bill Gates has a program with aircraft controlling the weather and he wants to block out the sun for your safety.
[01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:07.550]  They have the CIA director admitting it under Obama.
[01:28:10.449 --> 01:28:13.829]  Yeah, Bill Gates, 2.4 billion gently modified mosquitoes.
[01:28:14.069 --> 01:28:14.729]  And they did it.
[01:28:18.409 --> 01:28:27.149]  So, then there's a Google whistleblower or a Bill Gates whistleblower about, well, I was in the foundation and I heard them say this.
[01:28:27.250 --> 01:28:28.130]  Heard them say it.
[01:28:28.329 --> 01:28:30.250]  What's in the damn shots they give you?
[01:28:30.289 --> 01:28:31.949]  Every cancer virus they ever discovered.
[01:28:32.529 --> 01:28:36.770]  That's in the mainline Oxford studies that came out two weeks ago.
[01:28:36.930 --> 01:28:38.069]  Of course, we knew it years ago.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:42.579]  Dr. Judy Mikevitz exposed it almost five years ago here.
[01:28:43.079 --> 01:28:44.800]  Years before that, but on this show.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:49.020]  But forget electron microscope, you know, Oxford and Harvard studies.
[01:28:49.159 --> 01:28:51.100]  Let's just speculate they're doing it.
[01:28:52.359 --> 01:28:53.920]  So they have mosquitoes coming in to do it?
[01:28:53.979 --> 01:28:54.680]  Of course they do.
[01:28:55.039 --> 01:28:56.960]  They're going to give you a shot that does it right there.
[01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:58.579]  And remember the first year of the rollout?
[01:28:58.859 --> 01:29:03.199]  Any other drug you go take, any other shot, you go get a tetanus shot, you know...
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:05.699]  And you say, hey, the doctor, let me see the paperwork.
[01:29:05.699 --> 01:29:10.739]  And it comes in the little box that comes with the little bottle with the so-called vaccine in it.
[01:29:10.859 --> 01:29:15.779]  And you open up the paper and it's where it's made, the history, when it was developed, what it was tested on, adverse reactions.
[01:29:16.479 --> 01:29:23.340]  But remember, the COVID so-called vaccine, the mRNA gene therapy, what did it say?
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:24.880]  Nothing.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:28.100]  Absolutely nothing.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.439]  Because they wouldn't tell you what was in it.
[01:29:31.579 --> 01:29:33.779]  It wasn't just one thing they put out one time.
[01:29:33.859 --> 01:29:38.220]  It was a giant test of where the shots were going, who was being given the shots.
[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:39.100]  It was put in a database.
[01:29:39.399 --> 01:29:44.760]  I told you when they started the PCR testing and I was on Joe Rogan's show and they wanted me to do it and I said, I'm not doing it.
[01:29:44.859 --> 01:29:47.300]  I said, that's all going in a database and it came out years later.
[01:29:47.479 --> 01:29:47.979]  It was.
[01:29:48.079 --> 01:29:49.119]  It was a DNA test.
[01:29:51.710 --> 01:29:54.670]  That's how you get one, is out of the mouth of the nasal swab or blood.
[01:29:55.090 --> 01:29:56.250]  And of course they were.
[01:29:56.430 --> 01:30:00.229]  They do whatever they want, however they want, and they lie to you.
[01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:06.829]  And whatever some program you're told is for this reason, it might be for that reason at one level, but it's for a whole bunch of other reasons.
[01:30:07.210 --> 01:30:14.850]  Like when you're going to have a baby, and they prick its heel, put that little clicker, click, click, click, make it bleed, they squeeze the foot, you're all upset about it.
[01:30:15.010 --> 01:30:16.329]  They go, we got to test for blood diseases.
[01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:18.220]  And they go, where do you send it?
[01:30:18.279 --> 01:30:19.159]  Oh, it's a state form.
[01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:19.859]  It goes to the state.
[01:30:20.039 --> 01:30:25.979]  No, the state puts it in a government, UN, Pentagon, HHS database.
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:28.760]  And I exposed that almost 27 years ago.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.420]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.760]  Just type in, baby's blood at birth put in government database.
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:38.560]  So they treat you like an animal.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:39.779]  Don't act like one.
[01:30:39.979 --> 01:30:40.920]  Don't be ignorant.
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:41.800]  Don't be stupid.
[01:30:43.689 --> 01:30:45.729]  I told you, Trump's not been read into all this.
[01:30:45.909 --> 01:30:49.369]  They came out, they came to be totally compartmentalized when he was in office eight years ago.
[01:30:49.909 --> 01:30:52.689]  This time's got to be different, and Kash Patel is going after him.
[01:30:52.829 --> 01:30:54.750]  It's come out that January 6th was fed run.
[01:30:54.890 --> 01:30:55.949]  I was there, I already knew it.
[01:30:56.090 --> 01:31:01.149]  We had the cops arresting men in black that broke in, taking their handcuffs off, high-fiving them.
[01:31:02.539 --> 01:31:04.819]  We'll be covering that through the week, but that's old news.
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:10.140]  But now people are ready to see the people in black putting on the Trump gear before they attacked.
[01:31:10.479 --> 01:31:11.399]  We have them.
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:12.819]  But Kash Patel now is going to be in there.
[01:31:12.899 --> 01:31:13.760]  He's going to expose it all.
[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:19.239]  And you had Merrick Garland, the head of the DOJ, lie to Congress and say there were no feds there.
[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:20.380]  Come on, give me a break.
[01:31:20.859 --> 01:31:23.439]  Here's the cop about to arrest the guy that was being violent.
[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:24.640]  He says, hey, he shows him a badge.
[01:31:24.739 --> 01:31:25.239]  I'm a cop.
[01:31:25.539 --> 01:31:26.520]  We got him inside.
[01:31:26.699 --> 01:31:27.039]  Same thing.
[01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:29.250]  I'm a Fed.
[01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:30.170]  Yeah, here's the footage.
[01:31:30.329 --> 01:31:31.590]  It goes on and on.
[01:31:31.729 --> 01:31:32.449]  We have them.
[01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.989]  We have them.
[01:31:33.029 --> 01:31:40.210]  And I know as all this breaks and is confirmed, it just verifies everything we told you because we know what we're talking about.
[01:31:45.930 --> 01:31:52.789]  Here's folks sending me messages on X. Robert Newcomb, irregular, asymmetric warfare AI. I looked him up.
[01:31:52.869 --> 01:31:54.970]  He's got a good record of government and contractors.
[01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:56.770]  He says, Alex, I'm an expert and we should get him on.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:01.619]  In military drone technology, I have worked at the highest levels of the DOD as an engineer scientist.
[01:32:01.859 --> 01:32:08.520]  I will not disclose the classified information, speak on specific programs, or speak about military operational techniques.
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:11.739]  However, I can tell you the limits of the current science of physics.
[01:32:12.159 --> 01:32:14.159]  These drones are in fact the U.S. government.
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:21.960]  The fact that they are undetectable is a reflection of an autonomous navigation or operating in spectrums that are not detectable.
[01:32:22.239 --> 01:32:32.180]  These types of drones We're good to go.
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:03.479]  They're lying to the public about it and never getting a debrief from the FBI about the balloon or all the domestic swatting calls.
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:04.300]  Same thing.
[01:33:04.739 --> 01:33:09.039]  Yeah, just like never giving us real info about the shooter in Butler.
[01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:17.239]  All of the flight behavior I have seen in New Jersey is indicative of current vertical takeoff landing technology.
[01:33:17.539 --> 01:33:23.159]  All the UAP talk flights, orbs, fears is technology that already has been deployed.
[01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:23.699]  Yes.
[01:33:24.119 --> 01:33:25.100]  Get him on.
[01:33:26.449 --> 01:33:27.210]  He's got a good record.
[01:33:28.409 --> 01:33:29.329]  Public figure.
[01:33:29.630 --> 01:33:30.109]  Expert.
[01:33:30.569 --> 01:33:31.010]  Get him on.
[01:33:31.850 --> 01:33:32.670]  Crew, get him on.
[01:33:34.329 --> 01:33:35.449]  Looked up this guy.
[01:33:35.649 --> 01:33:37.069]  This is a radar guy here.
[01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:40.109]  I know who's operating the drones.
[01:33:41.090 --> 01:33:44.210]  25-year radar operator for a major agency here.
[01:33:44.649 --> 01:33:50.420]  Just thought I'd let you all know that this has been going on These past few weeks.
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:54.399]  The drones are part of a military drill being conducted by Space Force.
[01:33:54.819 --> 01:33:56.840]  Everything is on a need-to-know basis.
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:59.359]  Again, most of them are autonomous, so most people aren't even involved in the government.
[01:34:00.899 --> 01:34:05.020]  Which is why there's so much confusion, which is done by design.
[01:34:05.479 --> 01:34:06.159]  They know what's going to happen.
[01:34:06.539 --> 01:34:11.460]  What gets me concerned and why I had to make this post is that something big is about to go down.
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:19.140]  I happen to know that there are additional full lockout drills that are scheduled to take place between now and Christmas Eve.
[01:34:19.739 --> 01:34:21.340]  Remember Putin said nuclear war by Christmas?
[01:34:21.539 --> 01:34:22.399]  I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:23.079]  He said that.
[01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:29.439]  These operations involve the full turnover of all radio, radar, and aircraft communications like on 9-11 to NORAD they did.
[01:34:30.079 --> 01:34:31.840]  Just like they did on 9-11.
[01:34:32.439 --> 01:34:39.210]  Starting the night before through the next two days, they had a drill of everything turned over to NORAD. So that the inputs can be fake or real.
[01:34:39.409 --> 01:34:39.909]  This is key.
[01:34:40.670 --> 01:34:46.710]  I happen to know there are additional full lockout drills that are scheduled to take place between now and Christmas Eve.
[01:34:46.949 --> 01:34:53.590]  These operations involve the full turnover of all radar and aircraft communications to the military for several hours at a time.
[01:34:54.279 --> 01:35:02.020]  In conjunction with that, there are also scheduled satellite launches off the books, which have been occurring since October, at a feverish pace, I would add.
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:06.399]  They are setting up something very big, a big show for the public very soon.
[01:35:06.979 --> 01:35:10.420]  CNN was even at our facility shooting pre-roll footage for a future story.
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:13.539]  I don't know exactly what's going on, but all I know is this.
[01:35:13.699 --> 01:35:14.180]  Get ready.
[01:35:14.399 --> 01:35:17.279]  Peace and safety to all of you and your families.
[01:35:17.859 --> 01:35:18.659]  Dead on.
[01:35:21.010 --> 01:35:22.090]  Absolutely dead on.
[01:35:22.649 --> 01:35:29.689]  And then the last few years, all these whistleblowers that got reddit on the secret alien craft and got to see them, I might be saying they're bad people.
[01:35:29.829 --> 01:35:31.869]  They've been set up to pre-program that.
[01:35:32.029 --> 01:35:36.010]  I had Stephen Greer on, Dr. Greer, a couple years ago, predicting in the next few years this would all happen.
[01:35:36.810 --> 01:35:38.550]  This is incredible.
[01:35:40.670 --> 01:35:48.409]  So, in an hour and 50 minutes, about an hour and 30 minutes of airtime, we just solved...
[01:35:49.289 --> 01:35:54.529]  The massive escalation of UAP, UFO, garbage going on.
[01:35:54.729 --> 01:36:07.229]  Not all UFOs, not its whole history, but what's happening now, the laws they're trying to pass, the laws they're trying to reauthorize, potential national security emergency being declared using this, that's on the books.
[01:36:07.989 --> 01:36:08.630]  We nailed it.
[01:36:08.949 --> 01:36:09.729]  You nailed it.
[01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:10.989]  The crew nailed it.
[01:36:11.130 --> 01:36:30.149]  And so I would suggest to everyone, not just the millions watching right now at X and the millions listening on radio stations or the hundreds of thousands watching at infowars.com forward slash show, that you take this hour and 30 minutes, we're going to edit out the ads and post it in a few hours to real Alex Jones on X and band.video in case X ever gets messed up or something.
[01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:31.350]  We've got our own backups.
[01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:32.390]  Thanks to your support.
[01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:37.399]  It's critical to be independent, even though we love X. And you can take clips out.
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:38.079]  You can share it.
[01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:39.000]  This belongs to you.
[01:36:39.119 --> 01:36:40.659]  These broadcasts have always been free to air.
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:43.760]  Everything I air has always had a non-exclusive license to everyone.
[01:36:44.239 --> 01:36:46.960]  No matter if bad guys take this over and claim they own my words.
[01:36:47.119 --> 01:36:47.880]  It's all my free speech.
[01:36:47.979 --> 01:36:48.720]  It's all my research.
[01:36:48.739 --> 01:36:49.500]  It's all my belief.
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:50.439]  It's all my soul.
[01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:52.810]  It's all open and free to the public.
[01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:55.869]  It's like if I publish a book and say it has no publishing rights, it's free to the world.
[01:36:55.930 --> 01:36:56.789]  Anybody can republish it.
[01:36:56.909 --> 01:37:00.630]  No one can ever come back and say, no, I own that because it's free to the world.
[01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:03.430]  So it's up to you now to get this information out.
[01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:10.289]  It's up to you now to educate your friends and family, to send this to Congress, to send this to lawmakers so they're not so damn ignorant.
[01:37:10.829 --> 01:37:13.949]  Spend some time, governors, Congress, public.
[01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:15.069]  Look into it.
[01:37:15.250 --> 01:37:15.710]  Learn it.
[01:37:15.869 --> 01:37:16.810]  Don't just believe me.
[01:37:16.949 --> 01:37:21.710]  I showed you so much, and I only scratched the surface more throughout the week.
[01:37:21.729 --> 01:37:31.649]  A whole bunch of expert guests, former intelligence agencies, General Flynn, former head of defense intelligence, former national security advisor, a bunch of other experts that are already booked.
[01:37:32.609 --> 01:37:39.039]  This whole week, we are going to be the source of Of Infowars resistance.
[01:37:39.539 --> 01:37:41.520]  And there's so many other great sources out there.
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:44.020]  Research everything for your own.
[01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:48.739]  But I believe we're going to be one of the most accurate, compelling, hardcore sources out there.
[01:37:48.819 --> 01:37:55.739]  But it's up to you to get the info, to research it, and to share it with everyone you know and those you don't know.
[01:37:55.819 --> 01:37:59.600]  And whoever you share it to say, hey, Big Brother's been fighting to keep this information from you.
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:00.899]  You want to get the deep dive?
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:01.579]  This is important.
[01:38:01.659 --> 01:38:02.680]  They're planning some big stuff.
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:03.880]  Big stuff's going down.
[01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:05.340]  Get this information.
[01:38:12.630 --> 01:38:14.449]  Now, my gosh, the other news.
[01:38:14.630 --> 01:38:15.930]  I could have done 10 hours on this.
[01:38:16.930 --> 01:38:21.970]  Woman who accused Duke lacrosse players of rape in 2006 now admits it was all fake.
[01:38:22.069 --> 01:38:27.569]  Yep, a false flag the Democrats supported to try to create racial division in America, like Jussie Smollett and all the rest of it.
[01:38:28.869 --> 01:38:30.470]  Sorry, been proven to be fake, but there it is.
[01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:32.310]  Poll, Democrats reject Harris.
[01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:34.909]  He floated running for president in 2028 being the governor of California.
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:36.640]  Everybody shot that down.
[01:38:36.779 --> 01:38:37.180]  What a joke.
[01:38:37.659 --> 01:38:42.380]  George Stephanopoulos and ABC apologized to Trump, paid $15 million for lying and saying he was a convicted rapist.
[01:38:42.439 --> 01:38:42.920]  No, he wasn't.
[01:38:43.199 --> 01:38:47.500]  He was civilly found guilty for saying he was innocent, never touched that woman he never met.
[01:38:48.199 --> 01:38:50.600]  E. Jean Carroll, in my view, just like the lacrosse lady.
[01:38:51.439 --> 01:38:52.340]  Probably sue me for that.
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:53.199]  I'm allowed to have my views.
[01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:57.380]  Blinken confirms the U.S. is putting al-Qaeda in charge of Syria.
[01:38:57.779 --> 01:38:58.380]  Full breakdown.
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:00.699]  Infowars.com.
[01:39:02.210 --> 01:39:02.829]  It's crazy.
[01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:08.989]  Trump blasts Biden for border wall fire sale, selling off all the parts of the wall that Trump could easily get done when he gets in.
[01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:09.970]  Stop the presses.
[01:39:10.170 --> 01:39:14.170]  USAID discovers Mexicans in major polls the majority are worried about open borders.
[01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:15.390]  Everybody is that has half a brain.
[01:39:16.409 --> 01:39:19.729]  Euthanasia now responsible for 1 in 20 deaths in Canada.
[01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:21.829]  Neocon defeat.
[01:39:22.050 --> 01:39:29.090]  Romney now admits MAGA is, quote, the Republican Party of the future and of now and doesn't think history will even remember him.
[01:39:29.210 --> 01:39:30.689]  They'll remember you as a traitor if they do.
[01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:33.439]  And it goes on and on.
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:36.659]  Open AI whistleblower found dead in a San Francisco apartment.
[01:39:37.199 --> 01:39:39.439]  Nancy Pelosi breaks her hip, gets her hip replacement.
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.619]  Humans may be fueling global warming.
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:43.579]  We need to get rid of humans.
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:44.899]  Or tax them to breathe.
[01:39:45.039 --> 01:39:46.600]  New York Post, UN calls for.
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:57.300]  Appellate court came out and said NASDAQ cannot be made to have a diversity board and put people on its board just because of what color they are or what sex or what sexual preference.
[01:39:59.430 --> 01:40:04.850]  Oh my gosh, there's so much more I didn't get to, but I know Chase Geyser will hit a lot of it coming up.
[01:40:05.050 --> 01:40:09.409]  Please don't forget, do your Christmas shopping at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:40:09.409 --> 01:40:10.289]  It's our great sponsor.
[01:40:10.369 --> 01:40:12.250]  Whatever happens to Infowars or not, I don't own it.
[01:40:12.329 --> 01:40:14.609]  So they'll continue on and fund the new Alex Jones Network.
[01:40:14.810 --> 01:40:17.770]  If we have to go there, regardless, it'll be rolled into the operation.
[01:40:17.890 --> 01:40:19.890]  We get good owners, good buyers coming in.
[01:40:19.930 --> 01:40:20.850]  I've heard some really good news.
[01:40:20.949 --> 01:40:21.430]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:40:21.529 --> 01:40:22.170]  So keep praying.
[01:40:22.890 --> 01:40:30.350]  We're back in court coming up in early January, and they still get shut down, but we exposed that fraudulent auction, and the judge said he never said anything like it to shut it down.
[01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:36.409]  So let's keep fighting, but go to the alexjonesstore.com.
[01:40:36.529 --> 01:40:40.409]  Get $40 free to spend each month in the store when you become a VIP member.
[01:40:40.770 --> 01:40:45.789]  People are really getting the Trump massive 2024 win limited edition ornament.
[01:40:46.029 --> 01:40:48.069]  People are loving the Trump on the stump elf.
[01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:50.130]  People are absolutely loving the...
[01:40:50.699 --> 01:40:54.439]  Optimal human, ultimate green superfood with incredible energy.
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:55.939]  That's going to sell out quickly.
[01:40:56.199 --> 01:40:59.880]  People are loving the ultimate CMOS, Irish CMOS, the superfood.
[01:41:00.079 --> 01:41:11.640]  They are loving the new super ultimate turmeric formula, the strongest turmeric, strongest concentrated Pepperdine, black pepper extract, and of course, a bunch of other great concentrates like ginger.
[01:41:11.859 --> 01:41:13.000]  Incredible for your whole body.
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:14.079]  Incredible anti-cancer.
[01:41:14.359 --> 01:41:15.239]  Incredible for your immune system.
[01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:16.460]  Incredible for inflammation.
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:17.239]  Incredible.
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:21.439]  It's all there at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:41:21.619 --> 01:41:26.880]  And there are five limited edition fundraiser posters.
[01:41:28.079 --> 01:41:29.220]  One with Trump.
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:31.779]  A couple of classic InfoWars.
[01:41:32.039 --> 01:41:34.500]  The InfoWars Star Wars-esque fundraiser.
[01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:36.250]  And one other.
[01:41:36.409 --> 01:41:40.170]  When those are gone, they've printed a limited amount, they're gone.
[01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:45.130]  And we're going to stop selling them on January 6th.
[01:41:45.149 --> 01:41:48.210]  I picked that as a day because it looks like they'll be probably sold out at current sales rates by then.
[01:41:48.529 --> 01:41:54.569]  So if you want to get one of these collectible posters that fund the operation, that's why they got some markup.
[01:41:54.750 --> 01:41:55.649]  It's with a t-shirt.
[01:41:55.810 --> 01:41:57.210]  We're making like five, six bucks on it.
[01:41:57.289 --> 01:42:05.729]  After our sponsor gets half the profit, And the shirt's like 10, 15, not 10, hell, an extra small would be 12, 14. An XXL is their quality, like 16, 70 bucks.
[01:42:06.289 --> 01:42:08.390]  Then the sponsor has their crew, their expenses.
[01:42:08.569 --> 01:42:09.350]  They get half the profit.
[01:42:09.369 --> 01:42:11.409]  We get half of it, like seven bucks on average.
[01:42:11.970 --> 01:42:13.409]  But not make a lot of money on t-shirts.
[01:42:13.489 --> 01:42:14.489]  So they spread the word and they're great.
[01:42:14.569 --> 01:42:15.289]  You meet like-minded people.
[01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:17.350]  Same thing with the supplements.
[01:42:18.130 --> 01:42:18.930]  But with the...
[01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:24.520]  Fundraiser posters, if you really want to help us have a memento on your wall, these are limited edition.
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:27.060]  We are going to stop selling those January 6th.
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:31.239]  There'll be some new limited editions, but these are from this critical period here, so thank you.
[01:42:31.319 --> 01:42:34.100]  Be sure and get those at thealexshonestore.com.
[01:42:34.619 --> 01:42:35.720]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[01:42:36.859 --> 01:42:38.119]  My two hours will end.
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:40.819]  It'll be up to you now to spread this incredible report.
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:43.680]  The mystery of the drone invasion solved.
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:44.619]  How important is that?
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:45.460]  Knowledge is power.
[01:42:45.579 --> 01:42:46.659]  People perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:42:46.939 --> 01:42:54.159]  But coming up, the mighty Chase Geyser takes over for Sunday Night Live for the next two hours.
[01:42:54.359 --> 01:42:55.600]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:43:01.800]  Now take those feeds from RealAlexJones and InfoWars.com and share them like your future depends on it because it does.
[01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:13.350]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:43:13.829 --> 01:43:16.029]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:43:18.979 --> 01:43:29.880]  I've got some good news for all the Infowars fans out there and supporters that have been upset that Vitamin Mineral Fusion, our best-selling product, has not been available for a few months.
[01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:40.640]  It is now back in stock, the original, exclusively available at drjonesnaturals.com, my dad's great supplement company based right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:43:40.739 --> 01:43:46.439]  He developed it and now it is exclusively available at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:43:46.439 --> 01:43:54.340]  It has All the highest quality vitamins and minerals and a whole bunch of other super foods and herbs concentrated in it.
[01:43:54.479 --> 01:43:55.800]  It tastes great.
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:44:06.060]  It gets maximum absorption because you put it in water as a fruit punch in a liquid form so it absorbs better in the stomach and the intestines.
[01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:18.869]  Ladies and gentlemen, It has all the essential vitamins and minerals, a whole bunch of other concentrates of super herbs that boost your immune system, mental clarity, focus, your energy.
[01:44:19.229 --> 01:44:25.409]  I love Vitamin Mineral Fusion and it keeps our broadcast on the air.
[01:44:25.529 --> 01:44:27.109]  A true 360 win.
[01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:30.510]  When this product first came out five years ago, I didn't really push it.
[01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:31.930]  Okay, it's a Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:34.430]  You know, amino acid, you know, fusion, great.
[01:44:34.569 --> 01:44:35.449]  It's just a staple product.
[01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:45.590]  And then it became more and more popular until it became our number one best-selling product just because the listeners and viewers loved it so much.
[01:44:45.810 --> 01:44:50.680]  Now, I know a lot of you that love it are already going to reorder it, but for folks who have never tried it, Try it.
[01:44:50.819 --> 01:44:51.439]  It's amazing.
[01:44:51.579 --> 01:44:52.380]  It's good for you.
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:54.460]  And it keeps the broadcast on the air.
[01:44:54.619 --> 01:44:57.600]  Our great sponsor is drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:44:57.739 --> 01:45:01.539]  There's so many other incredible products there like CoQ10, the highest quality.
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:02.859]  Quercetin.
[01:45:03.039 --> 01:45:05.659]  This is high-end quality at very low prices.
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:08.760]  You get it for 50% off together right now or 40% off individually.
[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:12.220]  Next level foundational energy is not a stimulant, but feels like one.
[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:13.119]  It cleans out your cells.
[01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:14.500]  There's the fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:16.880]  It's all there at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:17.939]  Thank you for your support.
