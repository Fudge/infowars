[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.960]  So, here we are in the Infowars studios on November 14th, 2024.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.459]  It is 619.
[00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.460]  And I've just been down the road at the Alex Jones Network Studios that were built as backups.
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.000]  And this is the facility we've been in for 16 years.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.559]  Now, I have major breaking news for everyone.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.019]  The headlines you see everywhere that The Onion bought Infowars today is not true.
[00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.759]  The judge had an emergency hearing today that we filed for at 8 a.m.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.159]  this morning.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.000]  It went on for several hours.
[00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:43.359]  He was extremely upset, the federal judge, Chris Lopez, and said, this is not a real auction.
[00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:53.579]  You don't claim there's a public auction where people can bid up and have them register for it and then two days before, change it and say the bids are secret and we don't have to take the highest one.
[00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.700]  Then he asked the U.S. trustee that ran this, what was the winning bid?
[00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:59.799]  He said, well, I can't tell you.
[00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.209]  Did you hear what I just said?
[00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:14.109]  Not only did they not take the highest bid, they won't even say what was paid, but they said, well, it's Alex Jones's judgment.
[00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.030]  That's like toilet paper.
[00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.030]  A billion and a half fake dollars that doesn't exist?
[00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.129]  You're gonna get a billion dollars out of this piece of paper?
[00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:31.170]  So you can't pledge, that's federal law in bankruptcy, a debt towards something.
[00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:39.549]  And especially because doubly, they didn't tell the other bidders that they were going to allow credit to be used to buy it.
[00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:40.230]  That's what they're calling it.
[00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.849]  It's credit in the future, pie in the sky on my future earnings.
[00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:52.250]  So they bought my company in a rigged fake auction that didn't even happen with my money that doesn't exist.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:02.239]  So the judge says he hasn't set the date yet, next Monday or Tuesday, he said early next week, I take that as Monday or Tuesday, to have an evidentiary hearing on this.
[00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:12.009]  My lawyers and the real bidders lawyers, who are very prestigious, Said they've never heard of something like this.
[00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:22.409]  Walter Sissack, the lawyer for the folks that tried to buy InfoWars that were good guys, is recognized as the toughest bankruptcy lawyer in Texas.
[00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.830]  He's known as the Bulldog.
[00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:25.669]  He's a no bullshitter.
[00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:30.449]  He said he's never seen anything like this.
[00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.050]  Well, I told him get ready for that.
[00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:35.229]  And they didn't really believe me.
[00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.840]  And they saw it.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:46.460]  So, Monday afternoon, two days before the auction, they said, forget all your bids that had to be in by November 8th.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.099]  Forget all that.
[00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.199]  Forget the contracts you signed, the deposit you put down, the rules you signed.
[00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:51.159]  That's out the window.
[00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:52.259]  There's a secret bid.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.800]  You just give us an envelope with your bid, and we'll tell you who the winner is.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.139]  And by the way, we'll take one that's lower if we want.
[00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.879]  And the U.S. trustee said he had the authority to do that, just like the last federal trustee.
[00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.280]  That the feds send into these cases if they want.
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.300]  Said he could shut this place down, remember, late May?
[00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.280]  And then two weeks later, the judge had a hearing and fired them, saying you have the authority to do that?
[00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.180]  The judge said to Chris Murray today, where did you think you had authority to do this?
[00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:19.460]  You weren't given the authority to do this.
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:27.099]  So, they've closed the building, cut off the satellite up, linked to the radio and TV stations, to something they didn't buy.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:35.430]  Through bravada, they ordered the IT people to shut down Infowars.com, We've been hijacked.
[00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.009]  So I told you they tried this in late May.
[00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:40.629]  People didn't believe it was so crazy.
[00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.729]  When they came and said, leave the building with security.
[00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.750]  I told the security, where's the order?
[00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.770]  Where's the court order?
[00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.870]  I guess we're not going to do it.
[00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.770]  And then two weeks later in court, the judge, it all came out.
[00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:52.969]  People were like, well, that was true, Alex said.
[00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.050]  Well, you're damn right it was.
[00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:55.490]  Now you see them bragging.
[00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.389]  They shut us down everywhere.
[00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:01.449]  But here I am in this building with the equipment and the rest of it.
[00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.449]  So, what we're supposed to sit here with the crew and everybody, I guess, wait for the judge's hearing.
[00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.969]  That's fine.
[00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.930]  And they said in the hearing, we don't want them back in the building, Your Honor.
[00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.550]  They'll try to get the equipment.
[00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.850]  What, from our studio that we've got good buyers that are going to win the real bid, that we're ready to go up?
[00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.029]  If somebody would have beat what they were doing, you know, in a real auction?
[00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.810]  Going once, going twice.
[00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:27.370]  Numbers go up.
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.699]  And the judge kept saying, an auction is where people can bid.
[00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.860]  So, I mean, look at the screen right there.
[00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:43.420]  The Onion buys Alex Jones' Emperor Wars an auction to help with help from Sandy Hook families.
[00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:44.139]  No!
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.959]  The Onion's just a fake owner.
[00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:49.800]  They didn't do anything.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.949]  The families pledged their Award that's on appeal.
[00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.069]  You can't sell an award that's on appeal.
[00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:03.730]  That's like if I said I was going to buy a house with Confederate notes from the Civil War.
[00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:04.370]  They're worthless.
[00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.870]  Or Zimbabwean notes.
[00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:07.370]  Or Weimar Republic notes.
[00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:16.610]  And they would not tell the judge, even though the US trustee has told the news and told me this morning.
[00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:23.399]  That it was future money of mine that doesn't exist?
[00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:25.279]  Pie in the sky?
[00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:28.939]  That was gonna buy this company?
[00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:33.339]  I mean, for the families.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.120]  I didn't do anything to those people.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.100]  Barely ever even talked about them.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.899]  Didn't create the story.
[00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:37.319]  It didn't happen.
[00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:39.319]  Covered the people not believing it a few times.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.040]  Then they had PR firms claim I was attacking them years later.
[00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.779]  Years.
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.680]  Except 12 years ago.
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.720]  And raised money off me in PR for anti-free speech, anti-gun initiatives.
[00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:58.360]  And then had me defaulted by judges that found guilty and had show trials produced by HBO. The greatest show trials ever in history, mainline lawyers say.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.939]  Literally fake.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.939]  Like the Truman Show.
[00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:11.290]  So, these people have jumped the shark, and it's why there was a referendum against the left and lawfare by Trump got elected to landslide to spot all the fraud.
[00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:12.689]  That's all coming out.
[00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.610]  This is total insanity.
[00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:16.470]  So, I'm going to show you these articles.
[00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:17.410]  Come on over here, Reese.
[00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.329]  Here's some light over here.
[00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.449]  I'm going to show you these articles.
[00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.050]  These are the ones you go read.
[00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:25.410]  And my folks, we're at the hearing.
[00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:26.129]  They listen to it.
[00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:27.129]  I got a transcript of the hearing.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.680]  Judge Alex Jones' bankruptcy case orders hearing over InfoWars' sale to the Onion.
[00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:32.939]  No.
[00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:34.980]  He said, nope, he's not certifying it.
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.639]  Doesn't look like a real deal to him.
[00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:41.680]  The word is, bare minimum, he's going to order a real auction.
[00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.139]  InfoWars will be turned back on sometime next week.
[00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:50.660]  I will still be the owner under law, like he did the last time they tried to hijack it with another US trustee who he removed.
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.279]  And then this will go forward.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.839]  And then in January or so, I would guess, two months from now, there'll be another auction, and then it can be reality-based.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.639]  But I go on with my appeals, and it'll be on them.
[00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:05.800]  We're sure to win the Texas Supreme Court.
[00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:09.279]  Connecticut probably won't, but the Supreme Court there, and we get there, but it doesn't matter.
[00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:10.980]  America's awake.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.959]  The truth's coming out.
[00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:13.259]  So I'm going to say it again.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.379]  The judge blocked the sale today.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.019]  The judge says he doesn't believe it was a real auction.
[00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.069]  Now, you notice you're not seeing that in the news.
[00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.170]  Some of the law sites have it.
[00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.850]  But you go do your research.
[00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.730]  All you out there celebrating like idiots.
[00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:37.350]  If the judge certifies this, it's just another dark day for people's rights.
[00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:40.310]  Because you shouldn't say there's an auction.
[00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.209]  It really isn't an auction.
[00:07:43.209 --> 00:07:44.889]  Where, oh, you're supposed to have cash.
[00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:45.709]  That's the rule.
[00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.129]  Oh, sorry, I'm changing it.
[00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:48.310]  We can take less bids.
[00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.170]  Oh, and by the way, you can just be made up.
[00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.290]  Their judgment.
[00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:56.389]  Like that's money in the bank.
[00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.009]  That's like people that buy into Ponzi schemes.
[00:07:59.209 --> 00:08:02.269]  I didn't set the Ponzi scheme with a billion-half-dollar judgment on me claiming all this money.
[00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.449]  I was negative at the time of those trials.
[00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:07.670]  Negative money.
[00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:09.889]  Never had more than $10 million in the bank.
[00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.089]  That was backup for the company.
[00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:17.589]  I mean, you think my four-bedroom house and my Dodge Charger is going to...
[00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:19.610]  I'm not even into fancy stuff.
[00:08:19.769 --> 00:08:25.509]  My dad, almost 20 years ago, bought me this Rolex for $4,000 as a birthday present because I bought him a tag.
[00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.009]  Now it's worth a lot.
[00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.930]  I didn't know.
[00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.589]  20 years ago, I was getting the coolest watch because it wasn't the coolest watch then.
[00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:37.370]  Kind of like I didn't know when I lived in Austin and everything became the coolest place and Joe Rogan moving down the street.
[00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.230]  It's just, it's insane.

[00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:05.049]  And just do yourselves a favor and don't believe me, go read it all for yourself, okay?
[00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:09.490]  Now, there's a weird court rule that I have a transcript from the hearing.
[00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:13.480]  But the judges don't like it if it isn't an official one to read it yet.
[00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:17.360]  But AP is allowed to, and others, you can go read the quotes in here from the judge.
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.639]  But you've got to read like five articles to find a whole bunch of the stuff.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.539]  And they try to skew it against me, but they still admit the judge didn't think it was transparent.
[00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:24.519]  How could they do this?
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.100]  It doesn't sound like a real auction to him.
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.059]  No, he's not certifying the sale.
[00:09:29.299 --> 00:09:31.440]  Just like a month ago, they said they own my name.
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.820]  The judge said that violates the 13th Amendment against slavery.
[00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:36.240]  So they pulled that back, and they admit that in the articles.
[00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:44.070]  So these people think I'm so hated that they can set precedent or whatever they want to everybody on me.
[00:09:44.289 --> 00:09:45.990]  Just like Trump always says, they're not trying to get me.
[00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.769]  They're not trying to get him.
[00:09:46.889 --> 00:09:49.149]  They're trying to get through us to get to you.
[00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:54.350]  So I'll see you at Real Alex Jones on X. And starting at 11 a.m.
[00:09:54.409 --> 00:09:56.049]  tomorrow, we'll be back on air.
[00:09:56.169 --> 00:09:58.070]  We'll get Harrison and Owen, all of them, back on next week.
[00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.409]  We're just dialing stuff in.
[00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.129]  The studios haven't really been used for live stuff yet.
[00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.110]  We've got a bigger studio that's almost done there.
[00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:04.950]  And a lot of other backups as well.
[00:10:05.149 --> 00:10:07.929]  I don't own the Allen Shields Network, so good luck with them trying to shut that down.
[00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:13.549]  And there's a lot of other stuff happening, but major lawsuits are getting filed on this, I've already been told.
[00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:19.389]  And so to the folks out there, I know the Justice Department's involved.
[00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.490]  They tell you they're going to protect you.
[00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:21.850]  They're all in a lot of trouble.
[00:10:22.809 --> 00:10:23.129]  Okay?
[00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.049]  And so the worm's turned.
[00:10:25.629 --> 00:10:27.250]  And so you guys don't have a free hand anymore.
[00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:28.379]  All right.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.340]  God bless you all.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.200]  Thanks for your support.
[00:10:30.519 --> 00:10:32.240]  The saga continues on.
[00:10:32.659 --> 00:10:39.200]  Free speech is more valuable than ever, so realize that my fight is your fight, and they're trying to shut me down because they want to be able to shut you down.
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.820]  We have an existential threat to our freedoms, but humanity's waking up.
[00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:43.419]  We've turned the tide.
[00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:44.139]  We have the initiative.
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:50.360]  And so understand, your very future does hang in the balance, but humanity's waking up.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.659]  So God bless, and thank you again.
