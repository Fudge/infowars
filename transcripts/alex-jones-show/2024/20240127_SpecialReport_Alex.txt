[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399]  Please welcome Yuval Noah Harari.
[00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.900]  [Applause]
[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:18.899]   COVID is critical because this is what convinces people to accept, to legitimize total biometric surveillance.
[00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:20.960]  We want to stop this epidemic.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.123]  We need not just to monitor people, we need to monitor what's happening under their skin.
[00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:36.980]  What we've seen so far is corporations and governments collecting data about where we go, who we meet, what movies we watch.
[00:00:37.781 --> 00:00:42.246]  The next phase is the surveillance going under our skin.
[00:00:43.615 --> 00:00:50.740]  We now see mass surveillance systems established even in democratic countries, which previously rejected them.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.063]  And we also see a change in the nature of surveillance.
[00:00:55.704 --> 00:00:59.246]  Previously, surveillance was mainly above the skin.
[00:00:59.846 --> 00:01:01.668]  Now it's going under the skin.
[00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.834]  Embedded in his hand is a microchip that serves as his keys, his ID, and his wallet.
[00:01:09.014 --> 00:01:12.876]  Governments want to know not just where we go or who we meet.
[00:01:13.236 --> 00:01:16.718]  Above all, they want to know what is happening under our skin.
[00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.539]  What's our body temperature?
[00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.260]  What's our blood pressure?
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.381]  What is our medical condition?
[00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:24.223]  In a matter of seconds, the chip is inserted.
[00:01:24.743 --> 00:01:26.344]  Transformation is complete.
[00:01:26.624 --> 00:01:32.908]  When scanned, all of a person's information about their vaccination status is shown on a reader or phone.
[00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:38.992]  Now humans are developing even bigger powers than ever before.
[00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:44.215]  We are really acquiring divine powers of creation and destruction.
[00:01:46.337 --> 00:01:49.119]  We are really upgrading humans into gods.
[00:01:49.218 --> 00:01:52.577]   We are requiring, for instance, the power to re-engineer life.
[00:01:52.577 --> 00:02:03.298]  Humans are now hackable animals.
[00:02:03.443 --> 00:02:05.284]  You will own nothing.
[00:02:06.344 --> 00:02:08.485]  And you will be happy.
[00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:15.147]  I think that fake news have been with us for thousands of years.
[00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:16.708]  Just think of the Bible.
[00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:33.089]  You know, the whole idea that humans have, you know, they have this soul or spirit and they have free will and nobody knows what's happening inside me, so whatever I choose, whether in the election or whether in the supermarket, this is my free will.
[00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.049]  That's all.
[00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.049]  [Explosion]
[00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:56.049]   Many, maybe most legal systems are based on this idea, this belief in human rights.
[00:02:56.614 --> 00:02:59.975]  But human rights are just like heaven and like God.
[00:03:00.475 --> 00:03:04.576]  It's just a fictional story that we've invented and spread around.
[00:03:05.197 --> 00:03:12.699]  It may be a very nice story, it may be a very attractive story, we want to believe it, but it's just a story.
[00:03:13.473 --> 00:03:14.333]  It's not a reality.
[00:03:15.014 --> 00:03:17.395]  It is not a biological reality.
[00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:23.958]  Just as jellyfish and woodpeckers and ostriches have no rights, homo sapiens have no rights also.
[00:03:24.758 --> 00:03:34.262]  Take a human, cut him open, look inside, you find their blood, and you find the heart and lungs and kidneys, but you don't find there any rights.
[00:03:35.002 --> 00:03:42.766]  The only place you find rights is in the fictional stories that humans have invented and spread around.
[00:03:43.547 --> 00:03:54.650]  Now all this Huxley in Brave New World and then in the nonfiction book Brave New World Revisited that came out decades later where he breaks down the fact that again it was actually a future prediction of the world they were going to build.
[00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:00.969]   He talks about the fact that he doesn't see the future mainly being a 1984 jackbooted
[00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:08.209]   thug system coming after you, but it would be a nanny state that incrementally domesticated
[00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.769]   and enslaved people by pulling them off the land and putting them in cubicles and putting
[00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.490]   them in tiny coffin apartments and then taking control of human development and human reproduction
[00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.089]  where it would all be done in a laboratory.
[00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:24.408]   And you'll see in Demolition Man that all of that is obviously there.
[00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.871]  We're only going to play some clips of it, so I suggest you go back and revisit it.
[00:04:27.891 --> 00:04:31.633]  I think it's a pretty entertaining action film and extremely informative.
[00:04:31.653 --> 00:04:36.376]  But again, in this review, I'm going to go through it as quickly as I can.
[00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:49.562]  The whole thing starts with a police officer that got too overzealous going after the bad guy, so he's been sentenced to cryo-freeze.
[00:04:50.122 --> 00:05:04.813]   And while you're in the frozen animation, they put a chip in your brain, a Neuralink, That reprograms you and prepares you for when you get released in the future dystopic society that is masquerading as a utopia.
[00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:07.596]  And I'll just skip to the end of the movie here before we get into them.
[00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:11.372]  Predicted programming and it's just classic.
[00:05:12.473 --> 00:05:22.617]  The guy that's taken over the world has done it through a manipulated stock market crash decades before and it's like a BlackRock type company.
[00:05:22.957 --> 00:05:24.738]  They've banned eating beef.
[00:05:25.698 --> 00:05:28.460]  Again, they've banned having sexual intercourse to each other.
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.542]  Everything is virtual reality, but he doesn't have enough control.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:44.867]  And there are a lot of people that live in these underground ghettos, and the globalists talk about the future, those of us that don't want to live in their compact 15 minute control grid prison cities.
[00:05:45.247 --> 00:05:48.489]  Well, we can just live in some ghettos somewhere if we can feed ourselves.
[00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:51.151]  Well, basically, this is in the future.
[00:05:51.831 --> 00:06:24.137]   And the villain, who is again, the utopian liberal on the surface, he Unfreezes a super criminal from the past played by Wesley Snipes So that he can come into the future and take out his political enemies And then of course the supervillain thinks that he will then be able using the the brain chip to just deactivate the supervillain But of course that doesn't go the way he thought it would so it's got false flag attacks in it It's got all the real stuff
[00:06:25.216 --> 00:06:31.778]  That governments throughout really modern history have been obsessed with but have also engaged in throughout history being recorded.
[00:06:31.878 --> 00:06:57.905]   And if you go back to the creation of the theoretical design of the Internet when it was declassified in 1960, it was created by government psychologists, psychiatrists at ARPA, DARPA, where you would indeed have computer terminals in public everywhere that would make sure your programming was going correctly and would surveil you And then they could surveil all of us in lifetime with handheld computers.
[00:06:58.166 --> 00:07:10.173]  They just said as soon as they could make systems small enough to do it, which they did, they would then use all of that to have the central computer AI systems control us and turn us into automatons.
[00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:14.555]  So again, they addict us to these devices.
[00:07:15.376 --> 00:07:23.348]   And then once we're totally programmed and addicted to the devices, They're not just entertainment things anymore.
[00:07:23.708 --> 00:07:25.570]  Now they are our watchmen.
[00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.771]  Now they are our controllers.
[00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:31.535]  Now they are our prison wardens, and we don't know how to live without them.
[00:07:31.575 --> 00:07:35.478]  If you look at Gen Z people and millennials, they are completely dependent on phones.
[00:07:35.698 --> 00:07:37.400]  Hell, I'm already completely dependent.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.480]  They're incredibly useful.
[00:07:38.941 --> 00:07:43.965]  So they knew how to design these Trojan horses to make them very, very, very seductive.
[00:07:47.622 --> 00:07:55.928]  Please don't forget for all the great folks over here at Mug Club who've signed up at jonescrowder.com so that we get some of the funds and help support not just the great work of Steven Crowder and his crew, but us as well.
[00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:59.671]  And I want to thank you all for your support, and I'll see you next week right here at Mug Club.
