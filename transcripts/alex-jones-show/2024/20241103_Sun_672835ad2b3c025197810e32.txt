[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.000]  It is Sunday, November 3rd, 2024.
[00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:16.100]  We are one day, 9 hours, 59 minutes, 31 seconds, going deep into the heart of the most important election in world history.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:26.199]  We are only a few days away from the potential shutdown of Infowars, emblematic of how dangerous the situation is globally, and to free speech.
[00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:39.179]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is hands down As we build in this quickening, the most important broadcast I've ever done, and tomorrow will probably be even more important, and so on and so forth, because the quickening is here.
[00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was born for this.
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:52.579]  I was born to be alive right now in the battle for our republic and a fight to stop nuclear war and to save our children from the satanic pedophiles, and so were you.
[00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.759]  The energy that I feel right now is...
[00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.269]  Exponentially stronger than I've ever felt in my mission.
[00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:15.489]  And it's so clear and so pure that the enemy's energy that I'm always able to feel, I don't even feel it.
[00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.510]  God is with us right now.
[00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:19.030]  You can make no mistake.
[00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:27.950]  So, we have to be very, very focused and very, very judicious about what we say.
[00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:35.950]  Now, I have known this for weeks, and the evidence is all there, of massive attempted theft of the election.
[00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:46.510]  And last night, I went on air in a two-hour emergency broadcast from the Alex Jones Network, X, you find it, at AJNLive.
[00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.030]  And last time I checked, the different versions of it had about 3 million views, which is good for an emergency show we did Saturday night.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.840]  Reaching people should have.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.219]  We're really waking up 100 million.
[00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:03.980]  But the point is, I got massive 50% pushback.
[00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.439]  I usually get about 5% pushback from our listeners.
[00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:08.479]  And I listen to our listeners.
[00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.259]  I don't think I have all the answers.
[00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.020]  That why are you saying there's massive election fraud?
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.340]  Why are you saying they're trying to steal it?
[00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:15.340]  We're going to win.
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.020]  Everything's great.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.500]  And I went through the evidence that we need to expose that so we understand what we're going into.
[00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.580]  And now we know exactly what they're pulling and what's going to happen.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:38.780]  And then Trump came out at about, not at about, I was watching it at about 11.10 in the coffee break room after I had just worked out for an hour and a half.
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.599]  And I'm sitting there watching him live in Pennsylvania and it sounded like my show last night.
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.120]  Because he's looking at the same stuff I'm looking at with even more data.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.659]  And he said, now you better get out and vote to override this.
[00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.219]  And he said something even more important.
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.219]  He said, everybody around me, you know, my campaign people know this is happening, but they're scared because they try to put you in prison for talking about it.
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.080]  That's when you really know you're into tyranny.
[00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:12.439]  Whether you're right or wrong, you can come out and say an election was a fraud, but no, we have the evidence in lifetime happening now, and it's not happening in the dark like four years ago.
[00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:13.639]  It's in front of everybody.
[00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.759]  I've spent the last week showing all that, and I don't need to tell you about it, though there's a bunch of updates, and it's insane.
[00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:24.919]  So, Trump said, people are scared.
[00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.580]  And they don't want to believe it's happening again, but it is.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.460]  And if we don't override this, America's going into total tyranny.
[00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.680]  And I'm going to get put in prison.
[00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:39.460]  That's okay.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.539]  You're going to have to continue on.
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.620]  You've got to get paper ballots so we'll never get rid of this coup.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.000]  And that's the truth.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.180]  So, don't lie to people.
[00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:53.330]  Winston Churchill, after England lost the battle in France at Dunkirk, got up.
[00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:57.590]  I played the audio, the radio address before from Parliament.
[00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:02.710]  And he said, I'm not going to offer you a bunch of sugar-coated garbage.
[00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.569]  All I can promise you is blood, sweat, and tears and a lot of pain.
[00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.629]  But in the end, we'll defeat the Germans and restore our country.
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.099]  And I'm in the exact same position, so is Trump.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.560]  You're not going to get sugar-coated bullshit here.
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.120]  You're going to get the best analysis there is.
[00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:23.759]  And hours after, 12 hours after I said it last night, Trump said exactly the same thing, because it's the truth.
[00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:26.300]  We have massive guests today.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.019]  Stay with us.
[00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:27.800]  Back in 60 seconds.
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.639]  You are the resistance.
[00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:34.360]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.259]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:38.660]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:43.420]  It is Sunday, November 3rd, 2024.
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.519]  We are a day and a half out for the most important election in world history.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.180]  And we are already more than halfway through the election with more than 55% of the electorate voting, it's estimated.
[00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:07.579]  Ladies and gentlemen, I went on air last night in a two-hour emergency broadcast and I said the steel is massive and I went over the evidence.
[00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.110]  Just a portion of it that is absolutely damning, all confirmed, in duplicate, totally insane.
[00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:31.850]  And the last few weeks, as early voting went on and all this happened, I noticed it hardly ever hit national news, even Fox, but it's all over local news, ABC, NBC, it's even there, of mass flipping always from Republican to Democrat on straight ballots,
[00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.170]  hacking of all the systems, more people voting than are on the voter rolls.
[00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:41.879]  More people that aren't voters voting than are on the voter rolls per day in Michigan.
[00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:49.660]  Supreme Court of Nevada saying for three days after, they can take unpostmarked ballots, don't even know where they came from, and use them.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.480]  That's designed for fraud right there, whatever they need to get over the top.
[00:05:55.279 --> 00:06:00.060]  Illegal aliens in 10 states, federal courts ruling the last two weeks that they can vote.
[00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:02.160]  Supreme Court slapped down Virginia, but that's it.
[00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:04.100]  So illegals voting publicly in your face now.
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.060]  Wow, I thought that wasn't real.
[00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:07.420]  That right there, it's a fraud.
[00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:16.610]  The difference is this isn't four years ago where Republicans weren't looking at this and talking about this and the Trump campaign wasn't engaged.
[00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:18.470]  Trump campaign's not caught flat-footed here.
[00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.850]  They've got the intel.
[00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.449]  And I'm tracking it 18 hours a day.
[00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:26.470]  I am working 18 hours a day.
[00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.470]  Even though I love seeing my children, I'm barely seeing them because they don't really have a future and we don't win this thing.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.160]  So I am up at 5 a.m.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.920]  I am asleep at midnight.
[00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:45.040]  Other than working out, spending a little bit of time with family, and taking five minutes out to eat, or a few minutes out to brush my teeth, that's it.
[00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:46.139]  Total commitment.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.060]  And it is dizzying the fraud out in the open.
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.040]  It is incredible.
[00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:56.279]  And the evidence of massive Trump landslide is everywhere.
[00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.449]  And that's why they're so scared.
[00:06:58.529 --> 00:06:59.110]  So it's the paradox.
[00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.149]  Winning in a landslide, but they're going to try to steal it.
[00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.889]  People say, well, which is it?
[00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:02.850]  Well, it's right there.
[00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.029]  He's winning massively.
[00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.810]  They're going to try to steal it.
[00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:09.930]  And last night, my listeners went completely ape crap.
[00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.569]  I mean, I never get 50% pushback.
[00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.829]  50% at least.
[00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.430]  What the hell are you doing?
[00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:17.430]  Don't talk about conspiracies.
[00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.209]  We're going to win.
[00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.189]  You're going to discourage people.
[00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:21.370]  And I'm like, look, my job is to tell you the facts.
[00:07:21.829 --> 00:07:22.769]  Not lie to people.
[00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:24.189]  Not sugarcoat crap.
[00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:26.310]  If you're looking for that, you get plenty of places that'll do it.
[00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.250]  You sure as hell can attack me and tell the truth.
[00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.870]  Now, today they're all apologizing because Trump came out at 11 a.m.
[00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:33.990]  Central, 12 noon Eastern.
[00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.350]  It was 11 here, noon there.
[00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.329]  High noon.
[00:07:37.709 --> 00:07:38.970]  The key battleground state.
[00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.110]  And he said the evidence is just massive.
[00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:44.610]  He said they're fighting so hard to steal the damn thing.
[00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:45.449]  I'm going to play the clip in a moment.
[00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:53.949]  But he said my own people are scared of what the public will think and they're scared of being put in jail.
[00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:55.870]  Oh, yeah.
[00:07:56.769 --> 00:07:59.750]  They basically threw everybody in jail from his last administration that told the truth.
[00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:09.649]  So, we have a responsibility when this is going on to talk about it.
[00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:14.610]  And then you've got this, and it's why the deep state's so panicked.
[00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.810]  There are populist polls...
[00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:26.709]  There are polls that manipulate people who take days to get into it all.
[00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:36.990]  But the point is, the most respected polling agencies and data groups and all the betting services that are always the most accurate had Trump winning massively.
[00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:42.529]  And now even top Democrat pollsters that are respected say, no, he's going to win.
[00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.250]  Well, that's why they're going crazy.
[00:08:47.129 --> 00:08:49.149]  So I'm not saying Trump's not going to win.
[00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:57.539]  And I'm also saying they'll probably blow his airplane up when he's president-elect or something like that with a service-to-air missile.
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.220]  And I say that so people get ahead of it.
[00:08:59.259 --> 00:09:05.419]  He's asked for months and months for the military aircraft that have the anti-missile defense systems on them that fire the flares.
[00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:06.779]  They won't give it to him.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.080]  They said they would over a month ago.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:08.860]  They didn't do it.
[00:09:09.379 --> 00:09:14.399]  And I'm telling you, even top military, even, you know, Eric Prince has come out after I said it.
[00:09:14.899 --> 00:09:17.100]  I popularized it, but it's all known by military people.
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.600]  Service-to-air missile is the way to do it.
[00:09:19.749 --> 00:09:21.649]  And this is all going down.
[00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:23.149]  So here's the headlines.
[00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:25.549]  Head pollster predicts Trump landslide.
[00:09:27.289 --> 00:09:27.870]  Rasmussen.
[00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:28.809]  All of them.
[00:09:30.429 --> 00:09:32.250]  Top pollster predicts Trump landslide.
[00:09:32.409 --> 00:09:33.470]  Sweeping battleground states.
[00:09:34.149 --> 00:09:37.049]  Head of Rasmussen.
[00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.389]  Polymarket Trump bullish whale speaks out.
[00:09:39.429 --> 00:09:40.490]  Absolutely no political agenda.
[00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:41.990]  Trump set to win massively.
[00:09:42.429 --> 00:09:46.009]  Liberal data analyst Nat Silber says Trump favored to win.
[00:09:46.129 --> 00:09:49.169]  Accuses pollsters of putting finger on the scale to make elections seem closer.
[00:09:49.309 --> 00:09:50.610]  Well, they need to so they can steal it.
[00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:56.049]  Democrats drafting impeachment articles in anticipation of his election victory.
[00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.769]  Lawmaker claims Andy Biggs of Arizona.
[00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:01.289]  Well, they're already saying they are.
[00:10:01.649 --> 00:10:02.629]  They've said they're going to.
[00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:06.549]  Not certify them and create civil war conditions and have armed uprisings.
[00:10:06.649 --> 00:10:09.009]  I mean, I've played the clips like 50 times at least, each clip.
[00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:17.269]  Trump assures voters America will soon be an occupied country by the globalists no longer.
[00:10:18.049 --> 00:10:23.889]  Then mainstream media, London Guardian, oh, dead heat polls results are astonishing and improbable, these experts say.
[00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:27.850]  Yeah, that's all the fake polls they try to average it out with to say, oh, it's dead heat.
[00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:28.350]  No, it's not.
[00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:32.440]  And I had the head of Rasmussen on Friday to talk about it.
[00:10:32.539 --> 00:10:35.460]  And they are the most accurate agency out there.
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.240]  That's not even debated.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:36.879]  Go look it up.
[00:10:37.899 --> 00:10:38.259]  So...
[00:10:46.099 --> 00:10:50.960]  Pelosi, and I forgot to tell the crew to grab this so we can grab it during a break, said a bunch during the 2020 campaign.
[00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:52.860]  She said, it doesn't matter what he looks like he wins that day.
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.919]  We'll provide the votes after that are mail-in to win.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.299]  He will not be in the White House.
[00:10:57.419 --> 00:10:59.700]  Well, they're making similar statements now, so that's the arrogance you see.
[00:11:00.919 --> 00:11:02.399]  And Patrick Byrne's coming on in a few minutes.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.440]  He's talked to his sources.
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.779]  They're basically measuring the drapes.
[00:11:04.919 --> 00:11:05.960]  They're admittedly doing that.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.600]  They're saying he won't be allowed to be president.
[00:11:08.379 --> 00:11:09.080]  They're going to try.
[00:11:09.179 --> 00:11:09.840]  They're not all powerful.
[00:11:11.179 --> 00:11:12.360]  You got that with all the fraud.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.820]  You've got to get ahead of that because here's the headlines.
[00:11:15.179 --> 00:11:19.179]  Republicans preparing to reject U.S. election results if Trump loses, warned strategist.
[00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:21.399]  That's right here.
[00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:26.899]  So they're going to challenge a Trump win and not certify it.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.480]  They've all said they're top people.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.960]  But then if Trump challenges it with evidence, they're saying, oh, it's total tyranny.
[00:11:35.139 --> 00:11:35.600]  He's Satan.
[00:11:40.289 --> 00:11:43.190]  So they've said they're going to challenge it if they're unable to steal it.
[00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.789]  So we're in the middle of this.
[00:11:45.909 --> 00:11:47.070]  We better admit where we are.
[00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:48.629]  They're going to try to extend it out for weeks.
[00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:52.730]  Or they can try to steal Texas and win Tuesday night.
[00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.049]  We'll be here covering it live.
[00:11:54.129 --> 00:11:58.590]  Everybody you know, tune in at Real Alex Jones on X for 24-hour coverage.
[00:11:58.789 --> 00:12:00.129]  All the best guests.
[00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:01.429]  All the analysis.
[00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.470]  The key intel right through this thing for however long it takes.
[00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:15.029]  Here is Trump in Pennsylvania at noon today, Eastern, basically saying exactly what I warned you about last night.
[00:12:15.149 --> 00:12:17.309]  And of course, I'm talking to his people and I'm looking at the numbers.
[00:12:17.309 --> 00:12:18.009]  I can see the same thing.
[00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.929]  But there's this attitude, well, let's not discourage people even though it's happening.
[00:12:21.149 --> 00:12:22.190]  No, admit it's happening.
[00:12:22.309 --> 00:12:23.649]  We're overriding it, hopefully.
[00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:24.909]  But everybody better vote.
[00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:29.370]  And we also should get ready for the fight because the Democrats are already saying they're going to have it for months.
[00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.250]  And then if we talk about it, oh, no, you can't do that.
[00:12:32.429 --> 00:12:32.950]  Here's Trump.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.000]  This country is finished, and I say it loud and clear.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.059]  Everything we've been fighting for so hard to achieve for the past nine years all comes down to the next two days.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:46.580]  Think of it.
[00:12:46.659 --> 00:12:50.399]  We've worked in this for nine years, and we got a phony press.
[00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:52.940]  We got a lot of crooked people out there.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.600]  We're fighting like a son of a gun.
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:56.279]  We're fighting.
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.340]  They are fighting so hard to steal this damn thing.
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.460]  Look at what's going on.
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.000]  Look at what's going on in your state.
[00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:10.460]  Every day, they're talking about extending hours and stuff.
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.019]  Who ever heard of this stuff?
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.820]  We should have one day voting and paper ballots.
[00:13:21.179 --> 00:13:25.100]  Then I just heard that a couple of states may go an extra 12 days.
[00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:26.980]  How the hell do you have an election?
[00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:32.169]  You know, they spend all of this money on these damn machines.
[00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:36.789]  And paper ballots, you'd have the answer by 9 o'clock tonight.
[00:13:38.409 --> 00:13:41.029]  It's damn, it's a damn shame.
[00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:46.009]  And I'm the only one that talks about it because everyone's afraid to damn talk about it.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.919]  And then they accuse you of being a conspiracy theorist.
[00:13:50.919 --> 00:13:53.340]  And they want to lock you up.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.440]  They want to put you in jail.
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:14:01.240]  The ones that should be locked up are the ones that cheat on these horrible elections that we go through in our country.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.659]  And I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:08.820]  But for future elections, I won't be even a part of it.
[00:14:09.039 --> 00:14:11.600]  But you ought to damn well go to paper ballots.
[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:17.360]  You ought to go to voter ID. And you ought to have the election over by nine o'clock.
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.279]  I'm hearing now they're going to take weeks.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:22.919]  Can you imagine?
[00:14:23.139 --> 00:14:30.480]  They spend all this money, all this money on machines, and they're going to say, we may take an extra 12 days to determine.
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.379]  And what do you think happens during that 12 days?
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:35.519]  What do you think happens?
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:51.600]  These elections have to be decided by 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock on Tuesday night.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.659]  Bunch of crooked people.
[00:14:55.779 --> 00:14:56.980]  These are crooked people.
[00:15:00.039 --> 00:15:02.419]  We're a day and a half out from the main election day.
[00:15:03.379 --> 00:15:03.700]  Dr.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.820]  Patrick M. Byrne is our guest, former CEO of Overstock, journalist.
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:13.179]  He's got a new film out with General Flynn, The Enemy Within, and actually who we're defining as that, not the people, but the globalist.
[00:15:13.299 --> 00:15:14.759]  We'll talk about that towards the end of the hour.
[00:15:14.899 --> 00:15:15.519]  It's key intel.
[00:15:15.879 --> 00:15:18.620]  But Patrick, you have been putting out a lot of viral reports.
[00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:23.240]  Here's one of the headlines, Obama privately smirking 100% confident in victory.
[00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.470]  Don't believe the polls are what you read.
[00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.490]  Election already in the bag.
[00:15:27.909 --> 00:15:30.669]  Harris transition team 100% staff with Obama staff.
[00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:31.769]  That's even in mainstream news.
[00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:33.309]  Republic being overthrown.
[00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:38.470]  Our one chance is to overwhelm the rigged machines with massive turnout, which all the numbers and research shows.
[00:15:38.549 --> 00:15:40.090]  They've only got so much fraud baked in.
[00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.610]  So I want you to recap that.
[00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.210]  I went on last night, did a two-hour emergency report.
[00:15:44.779 --> 00:15:50.580]  That millions watched just detailing all the admitted fraud and scams and stealing that's so naked now.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.159]  Illegals voting in all these states.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.700]  Supreme Court slapping it down in one.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.100]  More people voting per day in Michigan than are actual voters.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.639]  500,000 that aren't even voters allowed on.
[00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:02.539]  On and on and on.
[00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:04.799]  Take hours to go through it all we have in the last week.
[00:16:04.919 --> 00:16:05.860]  It's just insane.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.100]  Georgia kicking out Republican poll watchers, violating law, putting up illegal...
[00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:12.570]  Drop boxes.
[00:16:12.789 --> 00:16:14.309]  I mean, it's just insane.
[00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.549]  And so recap what you're saying there.
[00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.970]  And people ask, what's our strategy saying this?
[00:16:19.029 --> 00:16:21.330]  Well, my strategy is to tell the truth that the steel's going on.
[00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:22.149]  I don't know if they'll be successful.
[00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:23.669]  That's what Trump said today.
[00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.970]  I got a lot of pushback from people.
[00:16:26.049 --> 00:16:28.730]  I know you got some too for saying what we're saying, but...
[00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:30.840]  This is to get people to understand it's happening.
[00:16:31.019 --> 00:16:32.820]  I mean, that's just what I do is tell you what we see happening.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.759]  I'm not going to just say something just because it makes you feel good.
[00:16:36.039 --> 00:16:38.519]  And then people better understand we're in a serious fight here.
[00:16:38.659 --> 00:16:40.159]  They're saying they're not going to certify him.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.539]  They're saying they're going to go to civil war conditions.
[00:16:41.759 --> 00:16:43.220]  They're saying they're going to have armed uprisings.
[00:16:43.299 --> 00:16:43.879]  I can play the clips.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.360]  You've seen them.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.820]  And so how do we respond to that?
[00:16:45.919 --> 00:16:47.240]  You're a respected, smart guy.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:52.360]  Recap what you said and where we are now and what you make of Trump basically agreeing with you and I today.
[00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:58.870]  Well, the first thing to know is don't be defeated.
[00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:00.610]  We absolutely can beat this.
[00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:02.450]  We absolutely can beat this.
[00:17:02.789 --> 00:17:15.890]  But secondly, as I said, I have sources within close to Kamala Harris, and she was in a meeting with them just within, I can't be too specific, but within, say, the last 48 hours.
[00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:25.349]  And the word is in that meeting, they're smirking and they think they have it in the bag.
[00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:30.349]  And they're saying, don't believe the polls, don't worry about a thing, we've got this.
[00:17:30.769 --> 00:17:32.490]  And with a little smirk.
[00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:37.630]  And that's because they believe they're going to be able to flip the votes and cheat.
[00:17:38.069 --> 00:17:42.390]  Now, don't take that for a moment to defeat you and say, well, what's the point of voting?
[00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.950]  You absolutely can beat it.
[00:17:45.389 --> 00:18:01.230]  If you go out and vote and you get all your friends, your liberty-loving friends to go out and vote, people need to understand this is the end of the American experiment if this Bolshevik revolution continues, and that's what this is, that if they get one more bite at the apple,
[00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.890]  it's over.
[00:18:02.509 --> 00:18:06.789]  So don't, on the one hand, face your situation honestly.
[00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:14.009]  And that is they are expecting to cheat and to move things several points and to win in the counting process.
[00:18:14.349 --> 00:18:17.910]  But don't let that make you feel defeated and give up.
[00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:28.430]  There is a way to beat it, and there's only one way to beat it, and that is everyone getting out there and voting and bringing everyone you can who's pro-liberty, making sure that they vote too.
[00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:31.829]  It's the only way we can defeat this, but we absolutely can defeat it.
[00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.309]  If you do that, there's nothing more that you and I can do.
[00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:35.410]  You've done so much, Alex.
[00:18:35.569 --> 00:18:37.150]  There's nothing more you and I can do.
[00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:39.289]  That's right.
[00:18:39.509 --> 00:18:41.089]  And you say the country's over.
[00:18:41.269 --> 00:18:43.450]  That's the communist strategy is to collapse it.
[00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:44.309]  They admit that's the plan.
[00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.369]  All of her policies would instantly collapse it.
[00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:49.410]  Warren Buffett is going completely out of the stock market.
[00:18:49.609 --> 00:18:52.349]  All the big business company people I know, I know billionaires.
[00:18:52.509 --> 00:18:53.450]  I know you're a very wealthy man.
[00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:54.869]  You know Warren Buffett well.
[00:18:55.069 --> 00:18:55.789]  That's on record.
[00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.150]  Let's just leave it at that.
[00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:00.470]  I mean, they know, and it's being signaled.
[00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:02.450]  I talked to some major executives today in Houston.
[00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:06.690]  They said they're preparing for total collapse if Kamala gets in.
[00:19:06.869 --> 00:19:07.690]  And so...
[00:19:08.119 --> 00:19:09.099]  Why don't you explain that to people?
[00:19:10.599 --> 00:19:11.039]  Yes.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.660]  Well, their plan is...
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.380]  You know, it's funny.
[00:19:14.519 --> 00:19:16.019]  All these years we thought...
[00:19:16.019 --> 00:19:24.700]  I wondered where lefties came from because I thought that so often what they wanted to do would clearly be bad for the long-term health of the country.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.259]  And it just turns out they didn't care.
[00:19:26.359 --> 00:19:27.200]  That's really the plan.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.279]  There's this cloward pivot strategy.
[00:19:29.279 --> 00:19:31.880]  We've talked about it before, which was to basically...
[00:19:34.179 --> 00:19:40.039]  Reduce the U.S. to rubble, and then out of the rubble, they think they emerge in charge.
[00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:43.259]  And that's how the tyrants conquer the United States.
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:51.940]  So all along, we thought we had people on our team who, we saw things differently, but we were all trying to accomplish the same goal, to lift the United States, to lift people here.
[00:19:52.099 --> 00:19:53.819]  They're not even on board with that program.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.960]  They wanted to collapse.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.779]  And they've always hated our Constitution.
[00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:03.740]  They've always hated You know, constitutions are what limit governments and tyrants.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.119]  They have all these...
[00:20:05.119 --> 00:20:06.740]  I grew up around these lefties.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.460]  They have all these ambitious plans for how they think they could make things better.
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.819]  And the Constitution shackles them, shackles them from their plans.
[00:20:16.079 --> 00:20:18.400]  And so that's why I always thought they hated it.
[00:20:18.539 --> 00:20:25.839]  But I've actually realized in the last few years, hanging around a lot of you and even the Christian community, that some of the...
[00:20:25.839 --> 00:20:26.400]  they're right.
[00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.180]  They said that some people are just demons.
[00:20:28.359 --> 00:20:29.619]  They just hate.
[00:20:30.209 --> 00:20:36.589]  To them, it would be the accomplishment of a lifetime, of a hundred lifetimes, if they can collapse the United States.
[00:20:36.769 --> 00:20:40.730]  They feel there are people who get satisfaction out of building a house.
[00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:47.289]  There are other people who basically get satisfaction out of burning it down saying, look, anything you can build, we can burn down.
[00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.109]  They're just this weird mentality.
[00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.190]  No, I totally agree.
[00:20:51.369 --> 00:20:57.369]  I mean, hell, I can show you a hundred articles in five minutes searching the web of the New York Times and others saying, time to get rid of the Constitution.
[00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:58.490]  Don't ask questions.
[00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.329]  The Bill of Rights isn't good.
[00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:01.390]  America's not good.
[00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.490]  They want to bring in this globalist tyranny.
[00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:08.349]  So getting back to what you said, Yesterday, two days ago, Trump responding.
[00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:10.609]  You saw that clip while you were coming on.
[00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:11.509]  I'm sure you've already seen it.
[00:21:11.569 --> 00:21:14.650]  He says, they're fighting so hard to steal this damn thing.
[00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.829]  They're going to collapse the country if they can do it.
[00:21:17.089 --> 00:21:18.809]  That's just a truthful statement.
[00:21:18.829 --> 00:21:20.390]  He said, you better get out and vote.
[00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.869]  We've got a real shot at this.
[00:21:23.009 --> 00:21:29.190]  And we've got even liberal polls are saying, yes, a Trump victory is there.
[00:21:30.009 --> 00:21:31.890]  So looking at this...
[00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:39.990]  And trying to explain to people with the left saying they've got different strategies to block it, to not certify it, or they can't steal it.
[00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:44.009]  What are the different scenarios from the different things they've been preparing that you see, Patrick?
[00:21:45.150 --> 00:22:02.490]  Well, the different scenarios, what the lefties don't get is they're just tools that if this happens and the U.S. collapses, first of all, in the civil war and ensuing effects, and this has all been modeled out in D.C., 90% of people die off in the first year from supply chain collapse.
[00:22:02.829 --> 00:22:07.029]  Just like an EMP. Supply chain collapse of food, fuel, and pharmaceuticals.
[00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.430]  90% are dead within one year.
[00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:11.789]  Then what really happens is China occupies us.
[00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:12.470]  They have a plan.
[00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:21.470]  Well, their plan, the lefty plan, is that they take over out of the rubble and now they're in charge unfettered.
[00:22:21.589 --> 00:22:24.690]  But the real plan that matters is the Chinese plan.
[00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:27.690]  The Chinese plan, and this is in their national security literature.
[00:22:28.049 --> 00:22:30.950]  You read a book called The 100-Year Marathon.
[00:22:32.599 --> 00:22:35.880]  They're planning to drive us into this kind of a civil war.
[00:22:37.079 --> 00:22:41.619]  And 80 to 90 percent collapse from the supply chain collapse.
[00:22:41.839 --> 00:22:45.480]  The cartels are given three years to rape, pillage, loot and burn.
[00:22:45.759 --> 00:22:48.660]  And then they withdraw and China occupies us.
[00:22:49.069 --> 00:22:52.910]  And by the way, top Chinese generals say that on state-run TV in China.
[00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:53.609]  We played the clips.
[00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:54.829]  That's in the Pentagon reports.
[00:22:55.009 --> 00:22:56.589]  That is the official battle plan.
[00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:02.109]  They're working with the Democratic Party to do it, so the leadership knows what they're doing, but the average even people, the minions, don't.
[00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:13.009]  And as you pointed out, that's in the Weatherman plans that came out in federal court in the early 70s that Larry Grafwald exposed, where Obama's top advisors were openly saying...
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:19.400]  The exact plan, break the U.S. Civil War, Cloward and Pibbon, then bring in Chinese troops.
[00:23:19.579 --> 00:23:21.220]  So that's how crazy this is.
[00:23:21.259 --> 00:23:22.140]  You're not making it up.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.480]  And there was a famous Chinese general.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.980]  He was Minister of Defense and Vice Chair of the Party.
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.819]  He retired in 03.
[00:23:30.259 --> 00:23:32.519]  He gave a speech that leaked in 08.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.839]  His name was Cher Haotian.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.180]  You can look up the secret speech of Cher Haotian.
[00:23:37.869 --> 00:23:40.730]  And he said a whole bunch of this.
[00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:44.569]  And that article that you just put up doesn't even get it right.
[00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:47.910]  It's not like China replaces us from over in China.
[00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:58.210]  The plan is, when we collapse, everyone gets exterminated other than maybe 30 million whites who are kept alive as slaves for a few years to turn things over.
[00:23:58.609 --> 00:24:05.529]  Everyone else is rounded up and put in FEMA camps, so they just die from the creation of a walking dead world.
[00:24:06.089 --> 00:24:08.630]  China has polluted 80% of their own groundwater.
[00:24:08.809 --> 00:24:09.430]  They don't care.
[00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:12.930]  For 2500 years, China has had this problem.
[00:24:13.089 --> 00:24:14.089]  They have terrible land.
[00:24:14.309 --> 00:24:16.089]  Four to eight percent of their land is arable.
[00:24:16.509 --> 00:24:18.849]  The United States is the greatest farmland in the world.
[00:24:19.369 --> 00:24:20.450]  They will occupy us.
[00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:33.789]  Every home of any size in America—Alex, I've never been to your home, but I assume you have a nice home—you can be assured that there's some Chinese colonel or general or CCP poobah who looks at—he's already been issued a deed to your home.
[00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:35.150]  He looks at your home.
[00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:36.690]  He looks on Google Earth.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.380]  Once a month, he sees that new hot tub swimming pool you put in.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.500]  He thanks you for it, Alex.
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.440]  He thinks he's occupying that.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:52.279]  And by 2028, or maybe 2027, originally the plan was 1949 to 2049.
[00:24:52.539 --> 00:24:53.759]  That was the 100-year marathon.
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:25:01.759]  In 2010, they publicly within China advanced the plan from 2049 to 2030.
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:07.619]  After the 2020 election, they internally started saying it's all over by 2028.
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.480]  No, I'm not playing the clubs the last year from Chinese national television.
[00:25:10.599 --> 00:25:12.279]  They say the plan is ahead of schedule.
[00:25:13.299 --> 00:25:15.299]  Yeah, and they will collapse.
[00:25:15.519 --> 00:25:17.619]  And again, it's the collapse through.
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.339]  They don't care.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.940]  They collapse us into civil war.
[00:25:23.839 --> 00:25:28.180]  Just life, the walking dead world that results does 80% of the work.
[00:25:28.359 --> 00:25:30.559]  They have the cartels emerge.
[00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:35.700]  You know that Obama already left Three million AR-15s and a trillion rounds of ammo around.
[00:25:35.779 --> 00:25:37.140]  By the way, it's on Indian reservations.
[00:25:37.359 --> 00:25:42.339]  There's great depots on Indian reservations along with 2,000 federal agencies.
[00:25:42.619 --> 00:25:43.779]  They collapse.
[00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:47.549]  Three years, the cartels are given to rape, pillage, loot, and burn.
[00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.150]  Then they get the order to withdraw.
[00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:53.470]  Actually, the deal was struck between Russia and China in 1993.
[00:25:54.069 --> 00:25:57.390]  And the deal is Russia gets Alaska and Western Canada.
[00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.609]  China gets the U.S. and Eastern Canada.
[00:25:59.789 --> 00:26:03.549]  And that's a deal they came to when China saw what happened to the Soviet Union.
[00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.430]  They went over in 1993 and they made this deal with the Russians.
[00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:07.569]  And that's the plan.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.200]  All right, stay there.
[00:26:09.299 --> 00:26:11.859]  I want to come back, and folks, this sounds crazy.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.500]  You can look it all up.
[00:26:12.579 --> 00:26:13.480]  It's actually on the record.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:24.599]  I want to discuss with you what we can do in these final hours to get other people to vote, but also what the Democrats have been telegraphing, and I think it's very good.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.779]  I mean, we got 30 seconds, but don't you think it's good that Trump came out and agreed with us this morning?
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.180]  I love that he did.
[00:26:30.319 --> 00:26:31.079]  I love that he did.
[00:26:31.099 --> 00:26:33.900]  I just saw that for the first time on your clip.
[00:26:37.629 --> 00:26:52.589]  The issue is, they're going to try to force, they're being so egregious and in our face, they want to force us to do something so then they can crack down on the federal government and say, oh, we're cracking down on these people who don't accept democracy.
[00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:53.150]  Exactly.
[00:26:53.369 --> 00:26:54.609]  They're planting false flags.
[00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:55.170]  Get on.
[00:26:55.309 --> 00:26:55.750]  Stay with me.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.180]  We are good.
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.940]  Nine days, nine hours, 26 minutes, 34 seconds till the potential shutdown of InfoWars.
[00:27:07.519 --> 00:27:09.019]  If you don't know about that, just type in InfoWars.
[00:27:09.079 --> 00:27:09.960]  We shut down November 13th.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.720]  It's all over Bloomberg, AP, Reuters, you name it.
[00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:14.859]  And that's emblematic of the attack on free press.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.339]  We're a day and a half out from the heart of the election.
[00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:20.160]  Already over half the folks who voted in the country.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.799]  And how many days are we out?
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.420]  If he can get past the fraud to inauguration, because that's the real danger zone.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.500]  Those 78 days, because we're two days technically out from the heart of the election, day and a half.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:36.440]  And there's 76 when the Democrats have said they're going to drive him from power, they're going to have civil insurrection.
[00:27:38.259 --> 00:27:40.640]  They're not going to certify him in those 77 days.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.680]  It's up to us to not get baited in or get set up on January 6th.
[00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.789]  The FBI says the feds say it's imminent.
[00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:49.930]  Trump supporters are going to stage violent attacks and terror.
[00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:51.509]  No, they're going to false flag us.
[00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:54.009]  Patrick Barber's starting to get to that.
[00:27:54.109 --> 00:27:54.670]  We went to break.
[00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:03.730]  But before we go back to him, we need to be on air one way or another if they shut down Infowars in nine days.
[00:28:04.289 --> 00:28:05.569]  Backup studios are there.
[00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:06.569]  All of it.
[00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:11.529]  But it takes funds for the crew and other things in my legal battles with the establishment.
[00:28:11.869 --> 00:28:12.690]  You support us.
[00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:16.349]  We can keep fighting indefinitely unless they pull the internet kill switch, which is coming.
[00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:17.849]  And you'll still be able to go on the web.
[00:28:17.849 --> 00:28:19.170]  You'll just go to establishment websites.
[00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:20.210]  They'll shut everything down.
[00:28:20.329 --> 00:28:21.289]  They've said they're planning to.
[00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:22.890]  Kamala has said she wants to.
[00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:27.369]  Remember, Tim Walz turns out as a communist Chinese sex handler and is a communist agent.
[00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:29.190]  Congress came out last week and said, no, he's an operative.
[00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.089]  Of course, Confucius Society, all of it.
[00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.170]  Patrick Byrne was talking about that.
[00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.930]  This isn't a game.
[00:28:34.309 --> 00:28:36.630]  This is asymmetrical fifth-generational warfare.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.779]  But America's waking up.
[00:28:38.859 --> 00:28:39.640]  The world's waking up.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.680]  Populists are getting elected.
[00:28:40.839 --> 00:28:43.359]  People are waking up to the WUF and the alliance with China.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.319]  So we're rising.
[00:28:45.319 --> 00:28:46.880]  That's accelerating their program.

[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.380]  I'm not going to spend a bunch of time on this because things are so urgent, but we need the support.
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.480]  You want to keep us on air.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.279]  We are vital in the fight.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:38.480]  We're always ahead of basically everybody else except for a few folks, and that's why they hate us so much, thealexjonesstore.com, and I humbly ask for your support and humbly thank you.
[00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:39.660]  All right, Patrick Byrne.
[00:29:41.809 --> 00:29:49.029]  Going back to where you got caught off the break, and we'll get to the enemy within and more, and just cut the suspense with a knife here.
[00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:54.150]  You were talking about what they're preparing, what they're planning, how they would roll that out.
[00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:56.769]  How would they legitimize challenging his election?
[00:29:56.869 --> 00:30:03.849]  How would they not certify, well, have a new January 6th, much bigger, mixed with a Governor Whitmer type fake kidnapping plot.
[00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:04.789]  That's my view.
[00:30:05.349 --> 00:30:07.569]  What do you see from their pre-preparation, sir?
[00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:15.750]  Well, first of all, the way we don't fall for January 6 again is do not think of national swarming the Capitol.
[00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:26.809]  What should have happened in 2020 and what I favored as a replacement after December 18th as an alternative was people going to their state capitals.
[00:30:27.009 --> 00:30:34.569]  There used to be, there was something called the Jericho March in that same month where people went out to their state capitals and protested.
[00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:37.680]  That's where you make...
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:51.460]  If we have people at 50 state capitals making themselves heard peacefully and peacefully and everything constitutionally, that's how we have to show our support.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:56.519]  When they cheat, one of the aspects of the color revolution, they have rent-a-mobs.
[00:30:56.599 --> 00:31:00.980]  They have rent-a-mobs just like Caramel Harris has rent-a-crowds.
[00:31:01.099 --> 00:31:02.640]  They'll have rent-a-mobs.
[00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:07.809]  And then the media will be saying, oh, these are great people fighting for democracy.
[00:31:07.809 --> 00:31:10.470]  They're fighting to stand against this dictator Trump.
[00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:15.789]  So people have to check out of the mainstream media and check as many people out of the mainstream media as you can.
[00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:22.349]  And secondly, do not descend on Washington, D.C. Be it protesting invisible at your state capitals.
[00:31:24.109 --> 00:31:27.609]  Their whole mission, they call it become ungovernable.
[00:31:27.809 --> 00:31:32.630]  If Trump wins, I mean, he's obviously going to win if it were a legitimate election without this cheating.
[00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:35.609]  He'd win in the biggest landslide in history.
[00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:44.230]  But their plot is to become ungovernable and then have the media hold them up as the heroic heroes fighting against tyranny.
[00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:45.509]  Flip that script.
[00:31:45.750 --> 00:32:05.619]  You become not ungovernable because you're peaceful, but you do it in your states, in your counties, and you have the alternative press reporting the truth that we're the good guys, we're the constitutional guys, and do not do anything to help the mainstream Push this narrative that says,
[00:32:05.779 --> 00:32:11.980]  oh, these are these noble people fighting against, you know, these rent-a-mobs are noble people fighting against democracy.
[00:32:12.519 --> 00:32:15.480]  Enough people are checked out that it can work this time.
[00:32:15.599 --> 00:32:21.960]  And don't descend on Washington, D.C. Keep your protests confined to your state, to your county seats, and especially your state.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:27.859]  Patrick calling into C-SPAN, calling into talk radio, calling the governors, the attorney generals, telling them to stand with Trump against the fraud.
[00:32:28.039 --> 00:32:28.359]  Look at this.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.480]  Washington state governor activates National Guard for election violence.
[00:32:31.599 --> 00:32:38.579]  They've been pre-programming in thousands of articles that I've seen that Trump supporters are going to attack and kill and bomb or shoot election workers.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.680]  That's never going to happen.
[00:32:39.819 --> 00:32:41.579]  If it happens, clearly a false flag.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:49.940]  So I see that as when these Democrat rent-a-mobs come out, somebody from a parking garage or something, God forbid, attacks them, then that's blamed on Trump supporters.
[00:32:50.099 --> 00:32:51.279]  We see all the pre-programming.
[00:32:51.299 --> 00:32:51.859]  What do you say to that?
[00:32:53.159 --> 00:32:54.599]  Maintain the moral high ground.
[00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:56.220]  Maintain the moral high ground.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.960]  You know, Buffett taught me once, you gotta be...
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:04.720]  I was in kind of an ambiguous business situation, and somebody wasn't acting good on the other side, acting well.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:13.019]  And I called him for advice, and he said, you know, they were being down and dirty, and I had to get down and dirty to defeat him.
[00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:14.809]  But how far do you go?
[00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:19.809]  And his advice to me was, he thought a bit and he said, always be better than the other guy.
[00:33:20.069 --> 00:33:23.309]  In fact, be a couple few steps better than the other guy.
[00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:30.269]  Because you're always going to miss, you know, you're going to miss estimate your own, you know, so principles.
[00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:32.690]  So always be a few steps better than the other guy.
[00:33:33.349 --> 00:33:40.519]  No, I mean, Patrick, I hear what you're saying, but my question is, Clearly, if they're saying Trump supporters are going to do all this violence, we're not going to do that.
[00:33:41.059 --> 00:33:43.799]  Clearly, we have this history of them provocateuring things.
[00:33:44.319 --> 00:33:47.019]  Clearly, they're pre-programming for false flags to be blamed on us.
[00:33:47.119 --> 00:33:48.019]  What do we do at that point?
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:56.420]  Well, don't fall for the as soon as you fall for the as soon as you fall for the provocateur stuff, you see what happened with January 6th.
[00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:59.529]  But you've got to get out there and be visible.
[00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:00.670]  Like, they're going to be visible.
[00:34:00.809 --> 00:34:01.329]  Be visible.
[00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:06.670]  And don't buy their PSYOP. They try to make you feel ashamed that you're on the wrong side or something.
[00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:11.730]  I've got some clown writing me now that he knows me.
[00:34:11.769 --> 00:34:13.710]  And they try to make you feel ashamed.
[00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:14.980]  They're demented.
[00:34:15.539 --> 00:34:17.519]  So, but make yourself visible.
[00:34:17.519 --> 00:34:22.179]  And when you wear an American flag or whatever the symbol is, and you're out there and they try to act like you're...
[00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:24.219]  Just remember, they're the fascists.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:24.920]  They're the extremists.
[00:34:25.099 --> 00:34:27.239]  Fascism is a phenomenon of the left.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.139]  Mussolini was a socialist.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:33.579]  He was the editor of this socialist magazine of Italy, Avanti.
[00:34:34.019 --> 00:34:35.719]  Fascism is a lefty phenomenon.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.639]  And we want to keep peaceful.
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:40.599]  We absolutely want to keep peaceful.
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.300]  Anything we do, they will...
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.320]  The Chinese have a saying...
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.679]  Sure, I mean, Nazi starts...
[00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:46.519]  I mean, it means National Socialist Workers' Party.
[00:34:46.559 --> 00:34:47.460]  Sorry, the Chinese have a saying.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.940]  Yeah, there's the National Socialists and the International Socialists.
[00:34:52.019 --> 00:34:53.719]  The International Socialists are the Communists.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.760]  The National Socialists are Fascists.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:57.860]  That's another kind of socialist.
[00:34:58.079 --> 00:35:00.599]  The fights between them are just intramural fights.
[00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:06.630]  The Chinese have a saying, it means see a cat, paint a tiger.
[00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:10.769]  If somebody sees a cat, then they turn around and paint it as a tiger.
[00:35:10.969 --> 00:35:14.230]  Remember that that's what they do and what the mainstream media does.
[00:35:14.429 --> 00:35:17.690]  Any cat you give them, they're going to paint as a tiger.
[00:35:17.869 --> 00:35:19.190]  So don't give them a cat.
[00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:20.829]  You're not worried about- No, I understand.
[00:35:20.929 --> 00:35:22.489]  So let's walk through the technicals and I agree with you.
[00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:24.989]  Clearly, they've said they're not going to accept it.
[00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.550]  Raskin's their main guy, spokesman on Bill Maher saying it.
[00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:32.789]  Clearly, Carmel's calling for armed uprisings because Trump's Hitler coming to kill black people.
[00:35:32.969 --> 00:35:36.849]  None of it makes sense unless they stage an event as the pretext to make that come true.
[00:35:36.929 --> 00:35:39.050]  And it could be even small, see a cat paint a tiger.
[00:35:40.449 --> 00:35:42.489]  What other shenanigans do you think they're going to pull?
[00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:44.469]  And how do we override that?
[00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:45.349]  And what should Trump be saying?
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.820]  Well, I can tell you really just what they're going to do.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:36:00.300]  The Trenda Aragua and these folks that you know about, the Venezuelans, they're in Atlanta, Chicago, New York, and L.A., and I believe their orders, their instructions, are to start a race war.
[00:36:00.539 --> 00:36:09.599]  They're going to deal with the black mafias and try to get them to fight the Sicilian mafias, the white mafias, and from that we get a race war.
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:15.179]  Just remember, we can't have, this can't be about white, black, or anything racial.
[00:36:15.639 --> 00:36:23.179]  So any signs of any racism or stuff, we have to eschew and show that that is not, there's no tolerance for that on our side.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:31.699]  But they're going to, I think this week, I think it's maybe on Tuesday or Wednesday, they're going to begin trying to start a race war.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.099]  And we have to make sure that doesn't happen.
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.500]  So there's that.
[00:36:38.579 --> 00:36:40.139]  There is a constitutional solution.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:51.619]  You know, the Constitution has Article 4, Section 4, It guarantees that the federal government guarantees to maintain a Republican form of government in every state.
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:57.599]  What that means is Rhode Island couldn't just vote itself into being a monarchy.
[00:37:01.019 --> 00:37:08.480]  The Constitution is a contract between the states and this Oregon This organization they created called the federal government.
[00:37:08.599 --> 00:37:12.539]  They clearly have dropped, aren't keeping up to their end of that contract.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.980]  There's got to be an Article IV lawsuit.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:23.099]  Now, this is language that 150 years ago, some justices decided was non-justiciable.
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.440]  They said, well, this is just some flowery language in the Constitution.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.679]  It doesn't really count.
[00:37:28.019 --> 00:37:35.900]  Clarence Thomas, about a decade ago, two decades ago, he wrote a dissent to something where he said this is not just flowery language.
[00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:39.039]  This is a very specific language that has meaning.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:51.670]  And we may be ending up turning to that and going to the Supreme Court because the federal government is clearly allowing and channeling corruption To disrupt the constitutional order.
[00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:54.929]  And so they are absolutely failing their Article IV duties.
[00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:57.429]  So I expect a lawsuit along those lines.
[00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:01.170]  But the truth is we can beat it through massive turnout.
[00:38:01.449 --> 00:38:06.889]  We've seen over and over, you know, they expected to win the House in 2022.
[00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.590]  And we fought tooth and nail.
[00:38:09.809 --> 00:38:14.170]  We didn't And election cheating, but we made it more and more difficult.
[00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:18.170]  So it was more and more difficult for the cheat, and we ended up winning.
[00:38:18.429 --> 00:38:21.670]  It wasn't the 30-seat red wave, but it was five seats.
[00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:36.150]  You do make a difference by voting, and we have throttled so many of the avenues of cheating that they're going to have to turn To an extreme, their most extreme level of cheating.
[00:38:36.269 --> 00:38:38.250]  And I described this on a show the other day.
[00:38:38.369 --> 00:38:39.670]  I see it's got millions of views.
[00:38:39.929 --> 00:38:43.829]  You want me to walk through what the ultimate, their fallback way of cheating is?
[00:38:43.949 --> 00:38:47.889]  Yes, I want to walk through, because there's massive evidence of all of it out in the open this time.
[00:38:47.969 --> 00:38:48.690]  They're not doing it in the darkness.
[00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:50.269]  I want to go back to something you said five minutes ago.
[00:38:51.489 --> 00:38:59.369]  The Pentagon and Reagan, and it came out during the Iran-Contra hearings, but it was separate, had Rex 84 preparedness exercise.
[00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:00.650]  It's on Wikipedia, folks.
[00:39:00.769 --> 00:39:01.130]  You can look it up.
[00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:01.690]  We'll put it on screen.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.139]  It's not Oliver North.
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:07.139]  You just type in REX-84.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.199]  There it is.
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.599]  That's separate what was happening down in Nicaragua, El Salvador.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.599]  This just came out during the hearings.
[00:39:14.159 --> 00:39:16.360]  And in REX-84...
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:24.840]  They talk about the left and communists using gangs as uprisings to bring down the country and start a civil war and collapse it.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.880]  Well, the left is actually using that playbook now.
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:33.260]  And Rex 84 was a response to Reagan knowing about the weathermen who trained Obama's plan for this.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:38.619]  So this is really, they're running the same operation that they knew was getting prepped in the mid-80s.
[00:39:38.679 --> 00:39:41.480]  Again, I want to just back up what you were saying, Patrick Byrne.
[00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:50.789]  Well, I can tell you they have a fallback way of cheating that we now have absolute 100% proof of.
[00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:53.449]  And I can, can I walk you through that?
[00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.789]  Yes, walk through what you're saying.
[00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.730]  Okay, this is going to sound technical.
[00:40:00.909 --> 00:40:02.909]  I got a way to explain it where it's not technical.
[00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:08.969]  Within the machines, what they do is at the last minute, there's always a glitch and they have to download a patch.
[00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:18.389]  Like you just saw in Michigan and the Michigan goon Secretary of State Benson said, Soros gal came out and said, ah, we've got to download a patch and it's not just Michigan, it's nationwide.
[00:40:18.789 --> 00:40:25.170]  They download a patch and it opens up a hole, so to speak, in the back of the machine security.
[00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:27.389]  They then connect to Serbia.
[00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:31.409]  We know the office in Serbia, the office has Chinese nationals in it.
[00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:32.570]  All this is illegal.
[00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:39.969]  From the Serbian office, they connect in the back of the machine, they create within the election server something called a virtual machine.
[00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:53.510]  A virtual machine is something that came around about two decades ago where you, on a computer, you create as if there's a second machine, like you're working on two separate machines when you work at it, but that second machine is not physical.
[00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:55.869]  It just exists virtually within the first machine.
[00:40:56.070 --> 00:41:03.769]  They come in through this virtual machine, they alter the hard drive to give any results they want, they can make that machine stand up and whistle Dixie.
[00:41:04.139 --> 00:41:11.199]  And then they withdraw and they collapse the virtual machine and close off that VPN connection back to Serbia.
[00:41:11.519 --> 00:41:17.880]  And you can't find this unless you do a detailed forensic bits and bytes audit.
[00:41:18.159 --> 00:41:21.860]  And we now know that's how they do it as a last step.
[00:41:22.039 --> 00:41:26.440]  They can just force anything they want to come out of it by taking this step.
[00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:34.710]  Incidentally, they didn't even admit that they had an office in Serbia until we brought it out.
[00:41:35.389 --> 00:41:37.289]  And then they said, well, it's an R&D office.
[00:41:37.389 --> 00:41:38.590]  It's not an R&D office.
[00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:40.329]  It's the center of gravity, frankly.
[00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:41.269]  And now let's raise this.
[00:41:41.429 --> 00:41:45.949]  What do we have with the other Soros operative that tried to take Trump off the ballot there in Colorado?
[00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:51.269]  Magically, 62 of the 63 counties, all the code keys the computers got given up there.
[00:41:51.449 --> 00:41:52.670]  I mean, this looks bad.
[00:41:55.239 --> 00:42:07.099]  Yes, and because, and I'm going to say this, the password on these machines, I'm going to say this with an asterisk, the password comes from the factory as password123.
[00:42:07.679 --> 00:42:12.500]  And it's just, they're supposed to get the machine and send it to something else.
[00:42:13.969 --> 00:42:18.969]  That got leaked, and the password for 63 out of 64 counties got leaked.
[00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:25.909]  But because so many of the counties around the country never changed their password, that password works for everybody.
[00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:27.789]  Now, here's the asterisk.
[00:42:27.989 --> 00:42:30.349]  It isn't actually password 123.
[00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:33.090]  I wouldn't want to be accused of doing anything.
[00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:36.550]  It's something equally silly, equally simple.
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:44.659]  That everyone on the know already knows what the password is, but it's something that simple as the password and all over the country they leave it.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.079]  They leave it one of two or three very simple passwords.
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:43:00.360]  So by leaking those 63 out of 64 counties, which the Secretary of State did, notwithstanding she just put a woman in prison for nine years for For accusing her of doing the same thing, which she didn't even do.
[00:43:00.619 --> 00:43:03.440]  But it's not just 63 out of 64 counties.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:09.920]  That compromised the machines nationwide because so many of them have kept the machines on password 123.
[00:43:10.579 --> 00:43:14.179]  And again, that's not quite accurately exactly the password.
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.079]  It's something similar silly to that.
[00:43:17.579 --> 00:43:18.300]  All right, Patrick.
[00:43:18.539 --> 00:43:19.699]  And of course, that's all on record.
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:20.019]  You're right.
[00:43:20.099 --> 00:43:21.800]  We just put the AP up on screen admitting it.
[00:43:22.159 --> 00:43:25.500]  What's crazy is they admit illegals are voting all over the country now.
[00:43:25.639 --> 00:43:29.039]  Federal judges are ruling they can't, other than the one Supreme Court ruling on Virginia saying they can't.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.159]  They admit they're going to just accept ballots.
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.860]  They don't know where they came from after the election.
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.780]  Now the Democrats are saying it'll be weeks and weeks and weeks.
[00:43:36.429 --> 00:43:41.010]  They then want to use that to gin up some type of civil unrest or provocateur event.
[00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:49.110]  We've already talked about how to respond to that, but we need not just you and I, but we need, and Trump's starting to do it, other people to get ahead of this.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:57.900]  I pointed out that when you've been exposing it, you're not doing it to demoralize people by pointing out they stole it four years ago and all the films, all the money you spent exposing it.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:06.340]  Now we've got attention to it and now there's a lot more spotlights on this and it's mitigated at some, even though there's more intense fraud being attempted.
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:10.159]  And as Trump said, we're in the process of educating people about this.
[00:44:10.239 --> 00:44:13.539]  We can't just not talk about it and we've got to admit the situation.
[00:44:15.759 --> 00:44:16.219]  Yes.
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:17.539]  And you have to admit it.
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:24.460]  And the way to fight it right now is getting out to vote and getting every patriot you know to make sure they vote.
[00:44:25.059 --> 00:44:28.500]  The more you do that, you overwhelm the rig.
[00:44:28.639 --> 00:44:30.000]  And we can overwhelm the rig.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:35.559]  If what they do is they shut down, their plan is to become ungovernable.
[00:44:35.679 --> 00:44:44.739]  They make it appear that they're everywhere and the press, ideally for them, will report, oh, these are the heroes standing up to tyranny.
[00:44:45.469 --> 00:44:46.929]  We have to stand up.
[00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:49.090]  We have to be visible in a peaceful way.
[00:44:49.329 --> 00:44:50.130]  And you know what?
[00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:51.630]  There's a lot of the press that's breaking.
[00:44:51.789 --> 00:44:53.550]  There are judges that are breaking.
[00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.849]  The Minnesota Supreme Court did something very good.
[00:44:56.969 --> 00:44:58.309]  The Fifth Circuit did something good.
[00:44:58.469 --> 00:45:01.070]  The Virginia said no.
[00:45:01.969 --> 00:45:09.469]  The Supreme Court, SCOTUS, said Virginia can prevent the order of putting 1,600 more illegals on.
[00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:10.789]  So we are pushing back.
[00:45:11.099 --> 00:45:12.179]  Because you're a big computer guy.
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.500]  It's not just Alex saying this.
[00:45:13.659 --> 00:45:16.119]  We are pushing back, and that's why the system's so scared.
[00:45:16.219 --> 00:45:26.679]  I know they're arrogant to their top campaign people to keep them in place, and that's also a tactic, but I can tell people behind the scenes and the things I'm seeing in that lip reading of Obama and Biden a few weeks ago, they're scared.
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:27.519]  They're scared.
[00:45:27.619 --> 00:45:32.639]  And Democrat top pollsters are saying, no, Kamala's set to lose, and Rasmussen's very, very respected.
[00:45:32.699 --> 00:45:33.960]  They say, no, Trump's about to win big.
[00:45:34.099 --> 00:45:34.960]  So are the betting markets.
[00:45:35.059 --> 00:45:35.500]  Let's be clear.
[00:45:35.619 --> 00:45:36.300]  Trump's winning.
[00:45:36.639 --> 00:45:39.099]  We're exposing their attempt to theft.
[00:45:40.989 --> 00:45:41.809]  Rasmussen's the best.
[00:45:41.949 --> 00:45:42.769]  They're the only one to trust.
[00:45:42.869 --> 00:45:45.829]  The other polls are there just to manipulate the public.
[00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:47.630]  They have no basis in reality.
[00:45:48.449 --> 00:45:57.289]  Rasmussen is the best and he's conservative in the sense of And even using conservative assumptions, it shows Trump is going to significantly win.
[00:45:57.409 --> 00:45:59.809]  And let's be clear, Patrick Byrne and I are not just saying that.
[00:45:59.909 --> 00:46:05.250]  You can go look at them for the last 30 years and they are the most accurate by outside rating agencies saying, no, they're the best.
[00:46:05.469 --> 00:46:06.190]  I mean, that's just a fact.
[00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:11.769]  They use techniques that are very similar to how corporations measure their consumer satisfaction.
[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:14.380]  It's much more scientific than these other polls.
[00:46:14.579 --> 00:46:23.400]  I saw something like CBS or NBC was using a poll showing that things were neck-and-neck, but they had to assume that 45% of the population is Democrat.
[00:46:24.519 --> 00:46:26.039]  The underlying...
[00:46:30.279 --> 00:46:31.739]  Patrick, Patrick Byrne, stay there.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:32.880]  Patrick Byrne, hold on.
[00:46:33.159 --> 00:46:33.679]  Patrick, hold on.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.179]  Your Skype went out for about six seconds.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.159]  Let's let it get stabilizing now.
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:41.119]  I want to come right back to you in a moment while that stabilizes.
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:43.639]  But folks, this is hardcore, accurate information.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.039]  Roger Stone's coming out with big Intel exclusive Naomi Wolf and so much.
[00:46:48.139 --> 00:46:50.260]  I'm going to do most of the show tonight.
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:52.199]  He's loaded for bear in the last hour.
[00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:54.889]  We're going to have Chase Geiser in here for Sunday Night Live.
[00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:56.269]  Full coverage tomorrow.
[00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:58.690]  Extended overnight coverage Tuesday night.
[00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:00.289]  I believe it's going to get held up.
[00:47:00.329 --> 00:47:01.349]  It's going to be a fiasco.
[00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:04.670]  We're going to be here continually at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:47:04.789 --> 00:47:05.309]  Band out video.
[00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:07.489]  Real Alex Jones on X. Share those coordinates.
[00:47:07.789 --> 00:47:11.070]  And at AJN for AJ Network.
[00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:12.090]  AJN Live.
[00:47:12.269 --> 00:47:14.329]  Follow that on X. Patrick, continue.
[00:47:17.789 --> 00:47:20.309]  It's absolutely beatable through normal means.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.320]  But you have to get everyone to vote.
[00:47:23.519 --> 00:47:28.239]  They do have a fallback plan where they can come in the back through Serbia and rig the machines.
[00:47:28.239 --> 00:47:29.440]  But now we know that.
[00:47:29.619 --> 00:47:30.320]  We know it.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:30.980]  We have it.
[00:47:31.519 --> 00:47:33.659]  I've spent a whole bunch of time in Central Europe.
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:34.659]  We've uncovered it.
[00:47:34.699 --> 00:47:35.760]  We know how it all works.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:36.840]  It's run out of Serbia.
[00:47:37.219 --> 00:47:37.860]  Get this.
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.719]  It's run on Huawei machines.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:44.619]  Our elections are effectively being run on Huawei, banned Chinese machines in Serbia.
[00:47:44.969 --> 00:47:49.849]  And the office, first of all, everyone who touches this code is supposed to be a vetted American citizen.
[00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:53.909]  It's a big shock to find out that the code is actually being run out of Serbia.
[00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:55.789]  That's the center of gravity.
[00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:06.070]  Patrick, I want to get you on in the next few days as well.
[00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:07.329]  Stay there, do five more minutes.
[00:48:07.449 --> 00:48:09.570]  We start the hour ahead of Roger Stone joining us.
[00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:12.750]  But I want to get to your new film that's so important.
[00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:14.769]  We put it on screen, The Enemy Within.
[00:48:14.949 --> 00:48:15.710]  We're not talking about the people.
[00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:16.670]  We're talking about the globalists.
[00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:20.269]  Let's play a quick two-minute trailer for this amazing new documentary.
[00:48:20.429 --> 00:48:20.789]  Here it is.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.860]  My name is Patrick Byrne, domestic extremist threat number one.
[00:48:27.119 --> 00:48:27.820]  Or not.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:32.460]  Perhaps I'm just somebody who's willing to say, the emperor has no clothes.
[00:48:33.119 --> 00:48:34.760]  You can decide for yourself.
[00:48:37.179 --> 00:48:38.000]  Patrick Byrne.
[00:48:38.119 --> 00:48:40.340]  They're following everything that you've been working on.
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:40.719]  Yes, sir.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:41.139]  Understood.
[00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:47.320]  You may know of me as the CEO of this $2 billion e-commerce company, but really, I have this other life.
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:50.679]  You have an unusual relationship with the United States government?
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.019]  Sir, why are you bringing this up?
[00:48:54.699 --> 00:48:57.480]  The FBI needed me to set up a bribe.
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.920]  We can't have agents running around creating crimes.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:05.440]  You know, it would violate too many rules for us to do it, but if you're willing to go do it, we'll look the other way.
[00:49:05.599 --> 00:49:07.360]  Hello, my name is Maria Putina.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.440]  Then I would make it happen.
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.980]  Instead of being happy...
[00:49:13.849 --> 00:49:15.630]  They say, just let it play.
[00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.789]  What?
[00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:18.130]  Let it play?
[00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:24.590]  Now, I know this may look like the deep throat scene from All the President's Men, but where do you think that stuff comes from?
[00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:26.650]  These things happen.
[00:49:29.929 --> 00:49:32.829]  I was encouraged to have a relationship.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:36.980]  And it's heated up.
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.420]  I'm going to meet the Trumps.
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:44.519]  I was starting to realize the feds were using Maria to smudge up the Republican Party.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.800]  And they were using me to use Maria.
[00:49:48.199 --> 00:49:51.119]  And this truth is going to be so explosive.
[00:49:52.719 --> 00:49:55.579]  Erase every moment from your memory.
[00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:07.150]  If you do this long enough, you begin to feel like an enemy of your own country.
[00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:17.329]  They arrest this Russian grad student so they could say, no, there is an actual Russian at the center of our Russian collusion drama.
[00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:22.190]  A civilization all begins with rule of law, and once that gets corrupted...
[00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:31.670]  It's like my worst fears have just been realized.
[00:50:31.969 --> 00:50:33.409]  I don't know, maybe I'm just being sensitive.
[00:50:37.429 --> 00:50:38.369]  EnemyWithin.movie.
[00:50:38.369 --> 00:50:41.030]  He's going to come back in five more minutes with us, but notice what just broke this week.
[00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:47.230]  The FBI trying to put sex operatives inside the Trump campaign, but of course they couldn't find anybody that was a traitor, so none of it worked.
[00:50:47.429 --> 00:50:54.889]  They also tried to set me up repeatedly to take money, quote, from Russians, so I called other officers of the FBI. And, of course, expose it all.
[00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:55.710]  Let's just leave it at that.
[00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:58.389]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[00:50:58.489 --> 00:50:59.630]  We'll finish up with Patrick Byrne.
[00:50:59.829 --> 00:51:03.449]  Then, Roger Stone has got all the latest and so much more.
[00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:05.690]  Naomi Wolf, it's all coming up tonight.
[00:51:05.989 --> 00:51:07.170]  Vote, vote, vote.
[00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:15.530]  Take the live feeds for InfoWars.com forward slash show, band out video, and real Alex Jones and InfoWars, and share them on X. Now, now, now, you are the Paul Revere's.
[00:51:17.989 --> 00:51:29.510]  Paul Revere's Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number two of this live Sunday, November 3rd, 2024 transmission.
[00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:33.090]  Roger Stone is coming up here in just a few minutes with huge breaking news.
[00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:34.670]  Naomi Wolf as well.
[00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:38.369]  Chase Geiser will be here for another three hours tonight.
[00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:45.409]  And then tomorrow, 8 a.m., Harrison Smith, myself, 11 a.m., Owens, 3 to 6, and I'm going to go live.
[00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:47.250]  8 to 10 p.m.
[00:51:47.269 --> 00:51:52.190]  with a big update tomorrow night and then 24-hour coverage overnight, Tuesday, and then right through.
[00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:59.750]  Patrick Byrne, again, is a well-known CEO and journalist and also been doing clenestine operations for the U.S. That's all come out now.
[00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:02.150]  He has a new film.
[00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:07.190]  The Emmy Within, his Skype was breaking up earlier, just finishing up statements on that and then any other tidbits.
[00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:08.050]  The film looks amazing.
[00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:09.050]  The Emmy Within, I'm going to watch it.
[00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:13.510]  All the big honeypot news with the FBI and the Trump campaign breaking this week.
[00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:15.590]  Just final information here.
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.719]  Okay, the real truth is I worked for Brennan and Comey and Obama.
[00:52:21.139 --> 00:52:23.780]  And I'm never going to disclose this in my life.
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:24.679]  I worked for them.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.380]  This coup started in Thanksgiving 2015.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.539]  It's all laid out in this movie.
[00:52:29.699 --> 00:52:30.539]  I was part of it.
[00:52:30.599 --> 00:52:31.440]  It's not a theory.
[00:52:31.679 --> 00:52:32.579]  I was part of it.
[00:52:33.219 --> 00:52:35.699]  I've been trying to derail it since 2019.
[00:52:35.699 --> 00:52:37.679]  I didn't understand what I was in the middle of.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.460]  The movie tells the whole story.
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.800]  Remember, patriots, stay peaceful.
[00:52:42.039 --> 00:52:43.659]  Always keep the moral high ground.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:47.239]  Be a couple steps better than the other side, okay?
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:48.980]  And we can beat this.
[00:52:49.079 --> 00:52:52.179]  At the end of the day, we're forcing them to use their hold card.
[00:52:52.179 --> 00:52:58.139]  And if we force them to use their hold card to rig it, it's something we can completely demonstrate in a court of law.
[00:52:58.159 --> 00:53:05.159]  And there's absolutely a way to do so in an Article IV suit to the Supreme Court if we just find a brave Attorney General.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.380]  Well, you just disclosed this.
[00:53:08.579 --> 00:53:14.340]  Roger Stone told me It had to be eight years ago or seven years ago.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.300]  He said, listen, Patrick Byrne is very smart.
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:21.860]  I think he's on the good guy's team, but he's definitely working for the feds as a secret agent, probably for Obama.
[00:53:22.139 --> 00:53:25.739]  We were having a talk about you last night, and he's coming up.
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:28.579]  And we basically rehashed all of that.
[00:53:29.019 --> 00:53:31.699]  And here it is now.
[00:53:31.699 --> 00:53:32.920]  You just basically admitted it.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:33.800]  But it's come out in the news.
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.460]  You did that in the last few years.
[00:53:35.579 --> 00:53:40.500]  And here you are, a deep state operative, admittedly, and exposing them right now.
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:45.360]  Ronald Reagan was the first president who gave me an assignment, Alex.
[00:53:45.639 --> 00:53:50.260]  I've been taking assignments from different branches of government since 1988.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:54.219]  And it's all laid out in that movie and is laid out in the book.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:58.480]  And Michael Flynn wrote the introduction to my book where he says, look, I'm a three-star general of intelligence.
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:00.559]  I knew about Patrick Byrne.
[00:54:00.719 --> 00:54:02.139]  I knew about Patrick Byrne works for the government.
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:05.320]  So Ronald Reagan was the first, was president.
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.139]  The first assignment I did was for Ronald Reagan.
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:16.539]  I've taken presidential taskings my entire life and taskings from different agencies of the government, always on the side of peace, always trying to do good things.
[00:54:17.039 --> 00:54:21.559]  I thought I was helping them pursue Hillary Clinton in an investigation.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.000]  It turns out they were using me to bribe her.
[00:54:24.139 --> 00:54:28.500]  I bribed Hillary $18 million so that Obama could blackmail her.
[00:54:28.869 --> 00:54:35.650]  She lost in a fluke, and it all turned into this Russian collusion delusion.
[00:54:35.849 --> 00:54:37.449]  And I say this not as a theory.
[00:54:37.449 --> 00:54:42.909]  I say this is the guy that had bribe Hillary Clinton, $18 million, and shagging Maria Bettina.
[00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:44.389]  So I'm right in the middle of it.
[00:54:44.389 --> 00:54:44.610]  Well, let's be clear.
[00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:50.309]  You've gone further than any time before, but it was a couple years ago, this came out in the news that you'd been a clandestine operative.
[00:54:50.389 --> 00:54:52.710]  So this is now, but you're just giving us more of the story.
[00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:57.789]  I worked directly through the period 2015-16.
[00:54:57.789 --> 00:55:03.690]  I was working directly for John Brennan and James Comey, who directly reported to them.
[00:55:03.949 --> 00:55:06.250]  And did they order you directly to target Roger Stone?
[00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:08.190]  No.
[00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:09.909]  Most of my...
[00:55:11.389 --> 00:55:11.750]  No.
[00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:13.369]  I didn't have anything to do with Roger.
[00:55:15.389 --> 00:55:16.909]  Most of my stuff is not domestic.
[00:55:17.090 --> 00:55:18.409]  Most of my career has not been domestic.
[00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:19.250]  It's been overseas.
[00:55:19.989 --> 00:55:26.570]  But tastings came in that I thought I was helping them on fighting crime regarding Hillary Clinton.
[00:55:26.909 --> 00:55:28.110]  And I'll tell you something.
[00:55:28.489 --> 00:55:30.190]  I don't think I've ever revealed this on your show.
[00:55:30.409 --> 00:55:30.469]  Hold on.
[00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:31.170]  60 seconds.
[00:55:31.329 --> 00:55:31.889]  Roger's coming up.
[00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:32.309]  Stay there, dude.
[00:55:32.369 --> 00:55:32.769]  60 seconds.
[00:55:32.849 --> 00:55:33.550]  We've got to join some stations.
[00:55:34.469 --> 00:55:35.530]  Patrick Byrne, stay right there.
[00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:36.670]  60 seconds.
[00:55:42.269 --> 00:55:43.590]  Roger Stone's coming in a few minutes.
[00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:45.309]  We're breaking massive news here tonight.
[00:55:45.449 --> 00:55:48.610]  Patrick Byrne is, of course, a guy that's run a billion-dollar company.
[00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:49.769]  He's been a famous journalist.
[00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:54.429]  He's been an operative for the CIA and the FBI, and that's come out a few years ago in the news.
[00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:57.130]  I mean, I knew that before from my folks.
[00:55:57.610 --> 00:55:59.849]  But he's here exposing that all now.
[00:55:59.949 --> 00:56:02.150]  He wasn't a bad guy in his view, and I don't think he was either.
[00:56:02.429 --> 00:56:03.710]  He started working with Reagan.
[00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:06.050]  He was being used for things and learned it was really for other things.
[00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:08.230]  I had family that worked for Reagan as well.
[00:56:08.469 --> 00:56:09.070]  Quite a few.
[00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:11.630]  And they said when Herbert Walker Bush got in, they all got double-crossed.
[00:56:11.769 --> 00:56:12.829]  Heard similar type stories.
[00:56:12.989 --> 00:56:17.650]  So I can actually, you know, attest to some of the things he's saying here from what I've heard from family directly, how this stuff works.
[00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:19.650]  But Patrick, you were trying to finish something.
[00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:23.750]  You said you were going to say one more thing that was exclusive that you're breaking now that this movie about you is coming out.
[00:56:24.449 --> 00:56:25.849]  I've never explained this.
[00:56:25.929 --> 00:56:27.030]  This is acted out in the movie.
[00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:30.289]  When I got the assignment to bribe Hillary Clinton, I said...
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:35.139]  I said, listen, I need a letter or something on paper.
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:37.840]  Most everything in my life has been on a handshake with Uncle Sam.
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.260]  But for this, I need a letter.
[00:56:39.639 --> 00:56:47.420]  And they said, the director says you can't be given a letter, but if you'll go to Washington, you can be shown a letter.
[00:56:47.559 --> 00:56:49.699]  And I said, so this is coming from Director Comey.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:57.639]  And two federal agents leaned over and said, and I said, Director Comey and the president?
[00:56:58.050 --> 00:57:08.289]  And two federal agents leaned over and said, and I said, gentlemen, you can tell Director Comey and President Obama that a from them is good enough for me.
[00:57:08.449 --> 00:57:09.570]  Consider Hillary bribe.
[00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:11.690]  That was around Thanksgiving 2015.
[00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:19.869]  And January 14, 2016, I got her in a room with a bag man from Azerbaijan, and he gave her an $18 million bribe.
[00:57:20.429 --> 00:57:25.829]  And when they told me to seduce her, Maria again, it was all on behalf of these heads.
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:31.039]  The agent said we are specifically going back to report on video conference to Comey and Brennan.
[00:57:31.179 --> 00:57:34.280]  This is all being done at the personal request of Barack Obama.
[00:57:35.219 --> 00:57:37.860]  That's a well-known internal fight between those groups.
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:42.219]  And it's clear, and this is even a bit in the press, Obama is running the Harris coup.
[00:57:43.679 --> 00:57:43.940]  Yeah.
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:56.880]  In fact, not only is Kamala Harris, not only does my source inside say they're acting completely confident and they're saying, don't worry, it doesn't matter what the polls say, it doesn't matter what happens, we got away, we're going to win this 100%.
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:00.960]  That her internal transition team is already constructed.
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:02.039]  It's all Obama.
[00:58:02.179 --> 00:58:03.139]  It's all Obama staff.
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.519]  It's going to be Obama's fourth threat.
[00:58:05.659 --> 00:58:07.900]  It's all the people around her for the transition.
[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:09.019]  It's all Obama-ites.
[00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:12.929]  All right, Patrick Byrne, I'm going to watch the film, enemywithin.movie.
[00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:13.489]  Looks amazing.
[00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:14.750]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:19.449]  Please pop back on with us during the election or anytime there's no intel.
[00:58:19.989 --> 00:58:21.170]  Text me or text the producer.
[00:58:21.309 --> 00:58:22.030]  Boom, get you back on the show.
[00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:22.369]  Thank you.
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:24.059]  Call Collect.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:24.800]  Call Collect.
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:25.300]  Yes, sir.
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:25.659]  Thank you.
[00:58:26.099 --> 00:58:26.420]  All right.
[00:58:26.659 --> 00:58:28.559]  Roger Stone is coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:58:28.739 --> 00:58:29.780]  We're getting him on the line right now.
[00:58:30.179 --> 00:58:42.119]  Let me recap for the masses of people tuned in on radio stations, TV stations, cable stations, Real Alex Jones on X, Infowars on X, and at AJNLive.
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:43.920]  At AJNLive.
[00:58:44.059 --> 00:58:45.079]  They shut this down.
[00:58:45.239 --> 00:58:46.039]  That's where you find me.
[00:58:46.159 --> 00:58:47.159]  At AJNLive.
[00:58:47.179 --> 00:58:47.880]  Be sure and follow that.
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:48.380]  That's critical.
[00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:50.530]  They're trying to shut us down on the 13th.
[00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:52.050]  I'm not going to spend a bunch of time on that.
[00:58:52.409 --> 00:58:53.570]  A lot of listeners hear me say that.
[00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:54.150]  They don't know about it.
[00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:55.469]  They go, what's he saying they're going to shut them down?
[00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:58.130]  They just type in Alex Jones, InfoWords will be shut down November 13th.
[00:58:58.210 --> 00:58:59.989]  You'll get AP, Reuters, Bloomberg, everywhere, okay?
[00:59:00.409 --> 00:59:01.670]  I'm not going to spend time on me right now.
[00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:04.329]  I'm just saying, I'm like an X-Wing going up against the Death Star.
[00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:10.630]  If you don't support us and spread the word and buy products at thealexjonesstore.com, We will be shut down.
[00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:11.570]  I need your help.
[00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.989]  Thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:14.150]  And I'm counting on you.
[00:59:14.289 --> 00:59:15.429]  I'm just going to move on and leave it there.
[00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:16.170]  Things are too critical.
[00:59:16.349 --> 00:59:16.889]  I need your help.
[00:59:17.010 --> 00:59:17.530]  Keep us in the fight.
[00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:18.050]  We're critical.
[00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:18.530]  You know that.
[00:59:18.869 --> 00:59:19.289]  Thank you.
[00:59:19.469 --> 00:59:19.829]  Respectfully.
[00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:23.750]  Thealexjonesstore.com and drjonesnaturals.com for great supplements.
[00:59:23.969 --> 00:59:26.670]  Now, Roger Stone's with us for the balance of the hour.
[00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:27.130]  Then Dr.
[00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.269]  Naomi Wolf is coming up.
[00:59:28.929 --> 00:59:29.849]  And so much more.
[00:59:29.949 --> 00:59:30.469]  Chase Geiser.
[00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:32.369]  But I want to explain something here.
[00:59:33.579 --> 00:59:37.639]  We're going to hit the latest shenanigans and how they're trying to not let the veterans' votes get in.
[00:59:37.719 --> 00:59:38.480]  And Roger's got that.
[00:59:38.659 --> 00:59:40.059]  And how they're leaving RFK Jr.
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:44.960]  on the ballot even though he tried to get off to try to hurt Trump and key states and all the chicanery going on.
[00:59:45.579 --> 00:59:51.400]  But the headlines out there at Real Alex Jones, Trump is openly warning.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.420]  And I played the video earlier.
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:54.719]  I'm going to play it in a moment and go to Roger Stone.
[00:59:55.619 --> 00:59:57.199]  He said it at noon Eastern.
[00:59:59.079 --> 00:59:59.760]  11 a.m.
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:00.119]  Central.
[01:00:00.599 --> 01:00:03.320]  I am sitting there in the coffee room working up here.
[01:00:04.019 --> 01:00:08.059]  And I don't watch his rallies often because I'm so busy.
[01:00:08.099 --> 01:00:09.000]  I just hit clips later.
[01:00:09.119 --> 01:00:11.440]  But I said, you know, I was on Infowars.com.
[01:00:11.559 --> 01:00:12.619]  We had a live link to it.
[01:00:12.719 --> 01:00:13.619]  So let me watch it.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:14.239]  I click it.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.280]  I'm pouring a cup of coffee.
[01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:20.800]  And it's like I'm talking from Saturday's emergency show.
[01:00:21.699 --> 01:00:24.659]  Trump says they're fighting so hard to steal this damn thing.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.920]  He explains, yeah, the numbers show we're going to win, but they're trying to overpower it.
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.679]  They're saying they're going to try to block it even if I win.
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:32.960]  They're going to dispute it.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.639]  Raskin and all of them say they're not going to certify.
[01:00:36.079 --> 01:00:37.559]  They're calling for civil war conditions.
[01:00:37.559 --> 01:00:39.940]  They're saying they're going to have armed uprisings, car vault.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.380]  And then when we talk about that, they go, oh, you're getting ready to lose.
[01:00:44.639 --> 01:00:49.659]  Oh, see, when they attack you for something, it's because they don't want you to say it because they know it's true.
[01:00:49.739 --> 01:00:53.139]  And they think you'll go, oh, I don't want to be discredited, so I'm not going to point out their theft.
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:55.059]  No, you get ahead of it.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:56.920]  Not because they're going to get away with it.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:57.960]  We're going to expose them.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:03.239]  And boy, are they being exposed with the illegal aliens and all the vote flipping and all the crap right now.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:07.300]  So if they even try this, which they're doing, it's going to blow up their face.
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:12.280]  That's why we're exposing it and telling everybody, even if you're in a red state and think you've got it, no, go vote.
[01:01:12.539 --> 01:01:14.699]  You're in a blue state and think you don't got it, go vote!
[01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:18.030]  Because only that can override the fraud.
[01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:21.309]  That takes an hour to explain, but they only have so many fraudulent votes baked in.
[01:01:21.389 --> 01:01:24.789]  They can only do so much, and then it's impossible in the statistics, so they can't do it.
[01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:30.010]  And top Democrat pollsters are admitting that all the numbers show Trump's going to win.
[01:01:30.389 --> 01:01:32.070]  And Rasmussen, Trump's going to win.
[01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:33.809]  That's why they're in panic mode right now.
[01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:36.230]  So everybody freaked out on me last night.
[01:01:37.690 --> 01:01:39.789]  And I called, by the way, after the show and talked to Roger.
[01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:43.730]  And said, oh my God, you're saying don't go vote.
[01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:44.449]  You're saying we're beaten.
[01:01:44.469 --> 01:01:45.210]  I didn't say that.
[01:01:45.809 --> 01:01:50.949]  I said we need to admit they're doing it and admitting they're going to try to block it and he overwhelmingly wins and get ahead of this.
[01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:58.449]  And you have the headlines, Republicans preparing to reject U.S. election results of Trump loses, warned strategists, AP Reuters, London Guardian, it's everywhere.
[01:02:00.479 --> 01:02:05.199]  So, look, Trump won 2016 because it was a landslide that overpowered the fraud.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:11.099]  Roger told me privately, the day before the election, he said, Trump's going to narrowly win, they're going to steal it.
[01:02:11.239 --> 01:02:12.260]  Don't tell people that.
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:14.739]  And this is in the past, so I don't go out of confidence.
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.239]  I've told the story before I got his permission.
[01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:17.789]  But he said, watch.
[01:02:18.289 --> 01:02:19.789]  This time he said, no, it's too big.
[01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:20.690]  He's barely going to win.
[01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:21.849]  But he's really going to win big.
[01:02:21.849 --> 01:02:22.769]  He's barely going to win.
[01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:24.969]  If they don't kill him or...
[01:02:24.969 --> 01:02:26.550]  Okay, I'm just telling you right now.
[01:02:26.869 --> 01:02:29.570]  And of course, Rogers basically said that on air, so I'm not giving out secrets here.
[01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:30.670]  But he's a really smart political.
[01:02:30.809 --> 01:02:32.650]  That's why they try to put him in prison and hate his ass.
[01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:33.750]  They want him off the game board.
[01:02:34.429 --> 01:02:35.789]  That's why they threw Bannon in prison.
[01:02:35.869 --> 01:02:37.230]  They threw Owen in prison.
[01:02:37.329 --> 01:02:38.230]  And they're trying to put me in prison.
[01:02:38.289 --> 01:02:39.469]  This is a war, people.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:45.900]  So I'm going to play this clip of Trump and then go right to Roger Stone with the balance of the hour, but now everybody's apologizing to me.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:48.199]  I don't care if you're mad at me or you apologize, listeners.
[01:02:48.639 --> 01:02:52.500]  I just want you to know that I'm in this game hard for 30-plus years.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:54.980]  I've got a pretty good brain.
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.260]  I talk to the people I trust.
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.980]  I'm trying to tell you what I really think is happening.
[01:02:58.610 --> 01:03:00.650]  And now everybody's like, oh my god, Trump said exactly what you said?
[01:03:01.269 --> 01:03:05.769]  Yeah, just because we don't want him to try to steal it again, and it's horrible.
[01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:07.309]  Of course they're trying to steal.
[01:03:07.389 --> 01:03:08.150]  They tried to kill him.
[01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:13.469]  They've had all the fake cases, the criminal crap, the lies, the hoaxes, the impeachments, the Russiagate.
[01:03:13.610 --> 01:03:16.710]  I mean, my god, people, of course, they're cornered rats.
[01:03:17.489 --> 01:03:19.050]  So we're going to tell you the truth.
[01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:23.130]  The evidence is everywhere, but I don't think they're going to get it because this landslide...
[01:03:23.719 --> 01:03:24.840]  Roger said, Trump's going to win.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.679]  2016, he said, he's going to barely win.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.280]  They're going to steal it.
[01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:30.739]  2020, he said, no, it's a bigger landslide than ever, but it won't look like it.
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:32.960]  And she's like, so don't tell people that or they won't vote.
[01:03:33.239 --> 01:03:35.639]  Well, we're so close now, it's all out there, okay?
[01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:40.619]  So this is game time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:42.610]  And don't be violent.
[01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:43.510]  I know you already know that.
[01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:44.789]  They're going to stage stuff and blame us.
[01:03:44.869 --> 01:03:45.429]  We've got to get ahead of that.
[01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:45.969]  We are.
[01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:47.630]  You've got to share the live feed of this.
[01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:51.030]  Once it's archived tonight, you've got to share it like your lives depend on it.
[01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:52.590]  This is an existential threat.
[01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:54.429]  Your entire future hangs in the balance.
[01:03:54.909 --> 01:03:56.090]  My future hangs in the balance.
[01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:57.610]  Me and Roger talk privately.
[01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:58.489]  We're not worried about it.
[01:03:58.510 --> 01:04:00.010]  We're like X-Wing fighters going to the Death Star.
[01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:00.789]  But let me tell you.
[01:04:01.389 --> 01:04:09.469]  If you think they came after us last time, you think it's been hell last time, I got everything in my ass and my family and my dick on the line, okay?
[01:04:09.969 --> 01:04:12.469]  So this is not a frickin' game.
[01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:14.190]  This isn't a Netflix show.
[01:04:14.289 --> 01:04:16.269]  This isn't Sopranos, people acting tough.
[01:04:16.449 --> 01:04:17.269]  This is it!
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:25.639]  And it's time for Americans to put their guts and their brains and their blood and their very will on the line and to pray to God to frustrate the plans of the enemy.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.380]  But God helps those who help themselves.
[01:04:27.639 --> 01:04:33.559]  And then to get out there and get others to vote and to be observers and to be peaceful and to focus and to pray for Trump.
[01:04:34.099 --> 01:04:35.000]  Now here's Trump.
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:36.639]  You gotta see the whole damn rally.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.780]  I've got like 30 minute clips of this where he goes even more.
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:43.099]  It sounds like my show 12 hours before at AJN Live.
[01:04:43.599 --> 01:04:43.960]  Okay?
[01:04:45.019 --> 01:04:46.500]  Because I know what I'm talking about.
[01:04:46.599 --> 01:04:48.179]  This is crystal clear what they're doing.
[01:04:49.199 --> 01:04:49.860]  Here's the clip.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:50.519]  We'll go to Roger Stone.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.940]  This country is finished.
[01:04:53.019 --> 01:04:54.679]  And I say it loud and clear.
[01:04:55.730 --> 01:05:02.730]  Everything we've been fighting for so hard to achieve for the past nine years all comes down to the next two days.
[01:05:02.889 --> 01:05:03.230]  Think of it.
[01:05:03.309 --> 01:05:07.070]  We've worked in this for nine years, and we got a phony press.
[01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:09.610]  We got a lot of crooked people out there.
[01:05:09.769 --> 01:05:12.289]  We're fighting like a son of a gun.
[01:05:12.489 --> 01:05:12.949]  We're fighting.
[01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:17.989]  They are fighting so hard to steal this damn thing.
[01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:20.130]  Look at what's going on.
[01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:21.710]  Look what's going on in your state.
[01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:27.119]  Every day, They're talking about extending hours and stuff.
[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:28.679]  Who ever heard of this stuff?
[01:05:29.179 --> 01:05:32.440]  We should have one day voting and paper ballots.
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:41.760]  Then I just heard that a couple of states may go an extra 12 days.
[01:05:42.099 --> 01:05:43.639]  How the hell do you have an election?
[01:05:45.659 --> 01:05:48.860]  You know, they spend all of this money on these damn machines.
[01:05:49.539 --> 01:05:53.480]  And paper ballots, you'd have the answer by 9 o'clock tonight.
[01:05:55.759 --> 01:05:57.719]  It's a damn shame.
[01:05:58.059 --> 01:06:02.719]  And I'm the only one that talks about it because everyone's afraid to damn talk about it.
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:07.579]  And then they accuse you of being a conspiracy theorist.
[01:06:07.579 --> 01:06:10.000]  And they want to lock you up.
[01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:11.099]  They want to put you in jail.
[01:06:11.239 --> 01:06:17.900]  The ones that should be locked up are the ones that cheat on these horrible elections that we go through in our country.
[01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:25.489]  And I don't know what's going to happen, but for future elections, I won't be even a part of it.
[01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:34.050]  But you ought to damn well go to paper ballots, you ought to go to voter ID, and you ought to have the election over by 9 o'clock.
[01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:35.889]  I'm hearing now they're going to take weeks.
[01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:39.590]  Can you imagine?
[01:06:39.789 --> 01:06:47.170]  They spend all this money, all this money on machines, and they're going to say, we may take an extra 12 days to determine.
[01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:51.090]  And what do you think happens during that 12 days?
[01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:52.190]  What do you think happens?
[01:06:58.409 --> 01:07:08.250]  These elections have to be, they have to be decided by 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock on Tuesday night.
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.320]  Bunch of crooked people.
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.639]  These are crooked people.
[01:07:15.119 --> 01:07:17.340]  We are unseating the globalist coup.
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:25.460]  Stonezone.com, former chief, political advisor, and longtime confidant, and former political prisoner Roger Stone joins us.
[01:07:25.719 --> 01:07:31.500]  Roger, give us the download on Trump there and then all the latest that's unfolding in your projections, my friend.
[01:07:33.119 --> 01:07:34.760]  You know, Alex, it's funny.
[01:07:35.019 --> 01:07:36.599]  I'm fighting a cold.
[01:07:36.679 --> 01:07:41.699]  It's a cold I think I picked up in Madison Square Garden, shaking hands with so many great patriots.
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.760]  I went down to the drugstore to get some Sudafed.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:45.320]  You know what?
[01:07:45.539 --> 01:07:49.000]  I had to show them a photo ID to buy cold medicine.
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:56.420]  Now, if you need a photo ID to buy cold medicine, why wouldn't they require a photo ID to vote?
[01:07:57.099 --> 01:07:58.300]  Makes no sense at all.
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:07:59.659]  The president's absolutely right.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:10.190]  If France Can count 38 million paper ballots in one day and get a count by the end of the day, why can't we do it with a computerized system?
[01:08:10.599 --> 01:08:13.920]  So, I was glad to see you have my good friend Pat Burnon.
[01:08:14.039 --> 01:08:14.739]  Pat's a good man.
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:15.440]  He's a patriot.
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:19.800]  I have to admit, everything Pat has ever told me turned out to be accurate.
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.439]  He has a number of sources that I don't have.
[01:08:23.439 --> 01:08:24.640]  He's a very learned guy.
[01:08:24.659 --> 01:08:26.199]  He's a good man.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:29.720]  He's very helpful to my family and I when my wife had cancer.
[01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.680]  I was glad to see you had him on.
[01:08:32.349 --> 01:08:41.430]  Look, I think we're looking at a very, very close election, and there are a number of factors here that are yet to play out.
[01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:55.939]  I find it Shocking to learn today that the Pentagon announced that they didn't have the resources to send absentee ballots to active duty military personnel.
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:59.720]  This is the first time this has ever happened in the history of the country.
[01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:14.850]  Now, I don't need to tell you, Alex, that the men and women currently in the service, whether serving in this country, but not at home, obviously, or serving abroad, When they vote, they vote overwhelmingly for Donald Trump.
[01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:17.970]  But this is shocking.
[01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:20.189]  And it's willful.
[01:09:20.310 --> 01:09:21.829]  There is no question about it.
[01:09:23.170 --> 01:09:28.689]  Without that military vote, it makes it much, much easier for them to steal.
[01:09:29.069 --> 01:09:44.689]  Now, what active duty soldiers need to know is, whether you're in Georgia or North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, you can go to a polling place,
[01:09:44.829 --> 01:09:50.789]  the closest polling place, to the base where you are stationed and you are entitled to vote.
[01:09:50.989 --> 01:09:52.789]  That is federal law.
[01:09:52.989 --> 01:10:00.600]  So the fact that you haven't gotten an absentee ballot in the mail Should not dissuade you from voting.
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:03.439]  And the numbers here are astronomical.
[01:10:03.819 --> 01:10:10.720]  I mean, that could mean, just looking at this here, in Georgia there's 120,000 men and women in Fort Benning.
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:17.939]  In North Carolina there's 127,000 Another 80,000 in Camp Lejeune.
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:24.100]  In Nevada, at Nellis Air Force Base, there's 30,000 men and women serving this country.
[01:10:24.319 --> 01:10:28.279]  In Virginia, there's 180,000 in multiple bases.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.560]  In Michigan, another 6,000.
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.640]  In Wisconsin, number 4,000.
[01:10:32.779 --> 01:10:34.680]  Those people need to vote.
[01:10:35.039 --> 01:10:36.579]  They didn't get an absentee ballot.
[01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:37.939]  This is purposeful.
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.560]  It's disgraceful, is what it is.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.739]  It's purposeful.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:48.779]  But they can go to the closest polling place to whoever their base is, and they are entitled to cast a vote.
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.100]  That is the federal law.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.600]  And Roger, it's all over the news.
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:55.720]  Oh, sorry, they didn't give ballots to the service people.
[01:10:55.939 --> 01:10:57.680]  Sorry, for the first time ever.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.199]  I mean, I've been covering elections 30 years.
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:01.319]  You've been covering them 50, working on so many.
[01:11:01.439 --> 01:11:08.579]  I've never seen anything like this, but I've never seen the amount of vote flipping confirmed all over the country from always Republican to Democrat.
[01:11:09.649 --> 01:11:12.369]  The data keys in all these different states being handed over.
[01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:14.430]  They're admitting illegals are voting in all these states.
[01:11:14.529 --> 01:11:17.750]  Federal judges are saying they can, other than the Supreme Court slapping down Virginia.
[01:11:18.029 --> 01:11:25.170]  I mean, it's just wild, and that's why the president, who's getting more data than even you and I, is saying, man, they're trying like hell to steal this thing.
[01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:41.079]  Well, and you see our Justice Department fighting in Virginia, fighting in Texas, fighting in Michigan to keep people who are clearly ineligible to vote in this election on the voting rolls.
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.739]  What could possibly be their reasoning?
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.359]  The reason they give is it's too close to the election to remove them.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:57.739]  Well, if they're unqualified, Whether it's the day before the election or three weeks before the election, they're either unqualified or they're not unqualified.
[01:11:58.399 --> 01:11:59.619]  And Roger, let's stop right there.
[01:11:59.739 --> 01:12:00.720]  We know state and federal law.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.060]  You know better than I. And I've looked at the Michigan law, the Georgia, all of it.
[01:12:03.279 --> 01:12:06.460]  The voting officials are able to look at a ballot and make the determination.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:12.699]  This Chinese student who voted illegally, they said he's been arrested, but his vote will count.
[01:12:12.819 --> 01:12:21.350]  So suddenly they can't remove, they admit, the 500,000 people they admit that aren't even voters that are on The Michigan rolls that you and Trump and others exposed four years ago.
[01:12:21.449 --> 01:12:22.350]  They denied it.
[01:12:22.409 --> 01:12:24.149]  Now they just admit it's real and say it stays there.
[01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:27.289]  And then you've got Nevada and the Supreme Court saying three days after.
[01:12:27.949 --> 01:12:29.189]  Unpostmarked ballots will be counted.
[01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:30.270]  I mean, my goodness gracious!
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.640]  Yeah, they look for any advantage.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:41.840]  I think the good news is that the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign are on much, much firmer footing here.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:44.060]  They're much better prepared than they were.
[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:50.260]  We've seen them go into court, as they just did in Georgia, for example, as they did in Pennsylvania.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.220]  The Democrats panicked in Pennsylvania.
[01:12:53.739 --> 01:13:08.329]  When the lines in the Republican precincts in Bucks County specifically but also in other counties were incredibly long and the The early voting was supposed to continue until 5 p.m.
[01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.729]  Eastern.
[01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:14.609]  They literally cut it off at 1.45, claiming that the process was too grueling.
[01:13:14.729 --> 01:13:15.470]  That was their excuse.
[01:13:15.649 --> 01:13:17.630]  It was too grueling and difficult.
[01:13:18.369 --> 01:13:29.489]  Immediately, the Republican National Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Whatley and Laura Trump, went into court and got those early voting hours extended.
[01:13:29.890 --> 01:13:31.350]  Just one good example.
[01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:33.750]  That wouldn't have happened in 2020.
[01:13:34.090 --> 01:13:37.949]  So we are much better prepared than we were four years ago.
[01:13:38.229 --> 01:13:40.850]  We've been in both federal and state court.
[01:13:40.930 --> 01:13:43.630]  When I say we, I speak of we as Republicans.
[01:13:44.229 --> 01:14:06.460]  And I think we're much, much better prepared not only to combat irregularities and pinpoint anomalies, but also additionally, all of the early data, Forget all this disinformation online about disproportionate number of women voting and that's panic to the Trump people.
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:07.680]  That's all nonsense.
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:09.260]  That's disinformation.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:31.229]  All of the early voting data that we're looking at, out of every state, It's extremely encouraging, which means that the entire effort by patriots like Cliff Maloney and Scott Pressler and the great folks over at Turning Point USA who have put in enormous hours on the ground,
[01:14:31.489 --> 01:14:32.369]  it's a grind.
[01:14:32.699 --> 01:14:33.699]  It really is a grind.
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:51.500]  They've done a phenomenal job in these states of, first of all, registering pro-Trump voters who weren't registering, and then making sure those who did apply for a mail-in ballot not only received it, filled it out, but either mailed it in or that they went and delivered it.
[01:14:51.619 --> 01:15:03.989]  So we have the best grassroots, on-the-ground operation any presidential candidate has had in the history of the country I'm a veteran of 13 national presidential campaigns.
[01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:09.029]  This is the best organized effort I have ever seen.
[01:15:09.529 --> 01:15:15.649]  Well, there's no such thing as a perfect campaign, but we are light years ahead of where we were in 2020.
[01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:17.029]  And it's showing.
[01:15:17.149 --> 01:15:17.750]  Where is it showing?
[01:15:17.909 --> 01:15:20.689]  It's showing in these early voting numbers.
[01:15:20.770 --> 01:15:22.710]  That's a very good leading indicator.
[01:15:23.289 --> 01:15:24.989]  All right, Roger, that's all very important.
[01:15:25.149 --> 01:15:26.810]  We've got another 30-something minutes with you coming up.
[01:15:26.909 --> 01:15:30.189]  We're still three, four minutes out from break, but just big picture.
[01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:33.329]  Trump comes out, says they're trying like hell to steal it, points it all out.
[01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:39.930]  We see unprecedented fraud, all this other clear blocking of the civil rights and rights of our troops.
[01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:41.430]  I mean, it's all going on.
[01:15:41.529 --> 01:15:42.329]  They're totally desperate.
[01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:45.779]  Raskin's saying they're not going to certify.
[01:15:45.939 --> 01:15:47.000]  They're saying civil war conditions.
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:48.399]  He's all over TV saying that.
[01:15:48.539 --> 01:15:49.739]  That Trump's trying to steal it.
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:52.399]  Looking at that, what do you expect him to do?
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.640]  I don't think we'll have a winner that night.
[01:15:54.819 --> 01:15:57.000]  They're already saying battlegrounds are not going to accept that.
[01:15:57.159 --> 01:15:58.899]  So what's the enemy's strategy?
[01:15:58.899 --> 01:16:00.840]  Let's start talking about that and then how do we respond?
[01:16:02.170 --> 01:16:03.869]  I'm happy to address that.
[01:16:04.029 --> 01:16:05.470]  I think there's a couple things.
[01:16:05.689 --> 01:16:17.409]  First of all, that Department of Defense directive, which for the first time ever gives the military the authority to use lethal force on Americans, is very chilling.
[01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:23.130]  The Pentagon actually tried to deny that they had put it out, but it's there in black and white.
[01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:24.130]  You covered it.
[01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:24.850]  I covered it.
[01:16:25.069 --> 01:16:26.409]  Everyone covered it.
[01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:31.930]  Their constant insistence that Trump's supporters will become violent.
[01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:32.750]  No, we won't.
[01:16:32.869 --> 01:16:34.069]  We renounce violence.
[01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:36.250]  A long piece of substack right now.
[01:16:36.369 --> 01:16:37.930]  Violence is not the answer.
[01:16:38.069 --> 01:16:38.630]  That's a trap.
[01:16:38.869 --> 01:16:46.050]  That's a false flag trap to Give them some excuse to crush the entire movement.
[01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:50.470]  So people need to keep their heads because the solution is never violence.
[01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:56.670]  And that's true, but we know they're obviously with their history of all the stage stuff like a Whitmer kidnapping and J6, they're going to provide it.
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:06.079]  Yes, perhaps, but it's very hard to wargame these things, because you have to see what actually happens on Election Day.
[01:17:06.279 --> 01:17:10.279]  You also need to see the outcome of the races for the House and the Senate.
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:13.199]  That's why I agree with Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:28.670]  I saw her on yesterday, and she said, look, I know this makes some people puke, but you have to go in there and vote not only for the president, But if you have a rhino in Congress who you don't particularly like, you have to vote for them,
[01:17:28.770 --> 01:17:37.909]  because if the Democrats get control of the House, as Jamie Raskin has already announced, they will refuse to certify Trump's election.
[01:17:38.069 --> 01:17:47.550]  Now, they said that that was a seditious crime, which they accused Donald Trump of in 2020, but now Raskin is proposing to do it himself.
[01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:51.649]  So I guess he is confessing to a potentially seditious crime?
[01:17:51.789 --> 01:17:52.729]  That's what it sounds like to me.
[01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:55.050]  We're going to break in a moment.
[01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:56.510]  I know you've got a lot of intel.
[01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:57.810]  What else are we going to hit when you come back?
[01:17:58.510 --> 01:18:13.689]  I want to talk about the importance of the RFK-Tossey-Gabbard-Trump alliance and the fact that the courts have kept RFK on the ballot in Wisconsin and Michigan, two absolutely crucial states.
[01:18:14.029 --> 01:18:19.409]  The same Democrat party that was fighting to get him off the ballot has now fought to get him on the ballot.
[01:18:19.609 --> 01:18:22.229]  Let's talk about the implications of that.
[01:18:22.489 --> 01:18:27.970]  More naked election interference by the panicked, collapsing, pathetic deep state.
[01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:30.090]  And we'll cover the polls showing Trump victory.
[01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:30.750]  Stay with us.
[01:18:33.909 --> 01:18:37.510]  Roger Stone's about to break down a lot of other critical intel for everybody.
[01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:39.430]  And coming up in about 30 minutes, Naomi Wolf.
[01:18:40.359 --> 01:18:43.300]  is going to be hosting the third hour.
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:47.539]  I'll kick it off whether Chase Geiser will be there, whether to kind of bring her in and out.
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:48.800]  Travick Coppin, he'll host.
[01:18:48.939 --> 01:18:53.439]  Always a hard-hitting, fast-moving, a lot of clips and a lot of analysis Sunday night live.
[01:18:53.439 --> 01:18:54.479]  He's doing one hour tonight.
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:19:12.319]  He'll be co-hosting with myself, Owen, Harrison Smith, and a bunch of other special guests like Roger Stone and others throughout tomorrow, throughout Tuesday, and it looks like it's going to get held up for a while during this epic moment that's We're trying to do the right thing for our children and stop World War III. So we're about to get into RFK Jr.
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:16.020]  and what's happening there and what a game changer he is and how they're keeping it on the ballot.
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:17.500]  Again, trying to steal the election.
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:18.819]  All election meddling they've kept.
[01:19:18.979 --> 01:19:21.039]  The troops from being able to vote never before happened.
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.840]  I mean, this is just shocking.
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.319]  And they're not even hiding it.
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:25.220]  Yeah, illegals are voting.
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:26.319]  Yeah, the troops can't vote.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.979]  The illegal aliens can vote.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.460]  Except in Virginia because the Supreme Court stopped that.
[01:19:31.539 --> 01:19:33.119]  But all the other federal judges, yeah, they can vote.
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:35.619]  Texas Secretary of State a month ago, yep, they can vote.
[01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:37.539]  We'll take their foreign IDs.
[01:19:37.779 --> 01:19:38.760]  We'll take non-citizen IDs.
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:42.859]  But veterans or service members, they can't vote.
[01:19:43.359 --> 01:19:43.939]  Active duty.
[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:45.880]  I mean, think of that headline.
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:48.399]  You can't even come up with words bad enough for it.
[01:19:48.619 --> 01:19:50.579]  I mean, this is sensationally ridiculous.
[01:19:51.369 --> 01:19:58.630]  So this is a desperation of a corrupt bureaucracy, the deep state, that thinks they own us and that are doing all this horrible crap to us.
[01:19:58.829 --> 01:20:04.489]  They just dropped a new ad from the Maha Alliance that Elon Musk is finding doing a great job with RFK Jr.
[01:20:04.710 --> 01:20:05.350]  about unity.
[01:20:05.609 --> 01:20:06.569]  Roger wanted to play it.
[01:20:06.630 --> 01:20:07.390]  I totally agree.
[01:20:07.609 --> 01:20:08.569]  I hadn't seen it yet.
[01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:09.069]  Just saw it.
[01:20:09.210 --> 01:20:09.529]  Incredible.
[01:20:09.689 --> 01:20:10.149]  Here it is.
[01:20:13.090 --> 01:20:15.390]  How will we be remembered?
[01:20:16.949 --> 01:20:20.329]  Look at the opportunities before us.
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:25.600]  This election really isn't about the left versus the right.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:33.439]  It's about we the people choosing our government and the choice between freedom versus tyranny.
[01:20:36.039 --> 01:20:39.260]  Nobody has a chronic disease burden like we have.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.899]  Why are we allowing this to happen to our children?
[01:20:43.699 --> 01:20:51.359]  Ultimately, the only thing that will save our country is if we choose to love our kids more than we hate each other.
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:56.819]  What is going on here is deeper than politics.
[01:20:57.659 --> 01:20:59.060]  It is deeply spiritual.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:05.899]  We are being called to rise above the hatred and the fear and the evil.
[01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:15.310]  We need to remember above and beyond that we must love our neighbors, that we must treat other people as we hope to be treated.
[01:21:15.649 --> 01:21:16.810]  You want to be a rebel?
[01:21:17.029 --> 01:21:18.050]  You want to be a hippie?
[01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:19.729]  You want to stick it to the man?
[01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:23.329]  Show up on your college campus and try calling yourself a conservative.
[01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:27.310]  America is going to reach heights that it has never seen before.
[01:21:27.609 --> 01:21:30.430]  The future is going to be amazing!
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.060]  Don't you want healthy children?
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:43.819]  Don't you want a president that's gonna make America healthy again?
[01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:52.979]  I come to you today as a former Democrat.
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:56.260]  I will be a first-time Trump voter tonight.
[01:22:19.090 --> 01:22:21.869]  The people dreamed this country.
[01:22:22.909 --> 01:22:27.909]  And it's the people who are making America great again.
[01:22:34.609 --> 01:22:37.369]  Well, I'm going to post that ad on Real Alex Jones and share it everywhere.
[01:22:37.649 --> 01:22:38.850]  Or go find it right now.
[01:22:39.289 --> 01:22:40.630]  Maha Alliance and get it out.
[01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:43.149]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is Go Hour.
[01:22:43.289 --> 01:22:44.149]  And here's the good news.
[01:22:44.930 --> 01:22:54.470]  I am so proud to be associated with President Trump, with Roger Stone, with Elon Musk, with Tucker Carlson, with all of you and this crew.
[01:22:54.970 --> 01:23:05.850]  And you look at our people, black, white, old, young, Hispanic, Asian, light in their eyes, loving, caring, anti-war, pro-freedom, pro-Second Amendment, pro-God.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.500]  And just pro-truth.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:13.159]  And what an alliance as evil just comes out in the open that's come together.
[01:23:13.159 --> 01:23:15.880]  And I don't see how they can steal this, how they get away with that.
[01:23:15.979 --> 01:23:18.739]  What Tucker said in Madison Square Garden, but they're sure as hell trying.
[01:23:19.119 --> 01:23:21.159]  I just, like, you can't see how they can do it.
[01:23:21.239 --> 01:23:22.859]  But that evil never gives up.
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:24.779]  But they always end up getting defeated.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:27.199]  And I believe we're turning the corner right now.
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:27.920]  And it's going to be rough.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.319]  And when he gets, wins the...
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:31.000]  President, they're going to try to block it.
[01:23:31.119 --> 01:23:32.920]  And once he's in, they're going to go crazy.
[01:23:33.039 --> 01:23:35.279]  But people are wise to them now.
[01:23:35.439 --> 01:23:37.279]  So we're in an incredibly historic moment.
[01:23:37.859 --> 01:23:41.420]  And I'm just glad to be on the good guys team and to be associated with all of you.
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:45.600]  And I just count on all of you to keep us on air because I'm not Elon Musk or Trump.
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:46.819]  Trump's been through hell.
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:50.199]  I need your support to stay on air in nine days.
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:51.579]  Good chance we'll be shut down.
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.079]  Well, we got backups, but it takes money, so we sell you great products, so you'll love them.
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:56.560]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:23:57.399 --> 01:23:58.220]  TheRJonesDadrills.com.
[01:23:58.359 --> 01:23:59.899]  And check out the great things that Roger's doing.
[01:24:00.039 --> 01:24:00.800]  StoneZone.com.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:03.199]  We're all under attack because we're willing to take on the enemy.
[01:24:03.239 --> 01:24:04.479]  I think if they can shut down...
[01:24:04.859 --> 01:24:08.699]  The pro-liberty people that there'll be no leadership, but the leadership is swelling.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:09.779]  People are engaging.
[01:24:10.079 --> 01:24:12.199]  People are getting off the fence, and it's a beautiful time to be alive.
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:15.500]  Roger Stone, what an amazing ad, and so truthful, so accurate.
[01:24:15.619 --> 01:24:17.340]  Everything out of Kamala's mouth's a big lie.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:20.000]  And then with us, it's very wholesome.
[01:24:20.159 --> 01:24:22.560]  I mean, this is something very historic, Roger.
[01:24:24.079 --> 01:24:30.399]  That's really what I want to reflect on, Alex, because I think it all has to be put in a historical perspective.
[01:24:30.939 --> 01:24:44.880]  In 1980, Ronald Reagan, an outsider, came from out of nowhere, totally underestimated by the Republican, Washington-based establishment, grabbed control of the Republican Party and began reforming it into the party of working people.
[01:24:45.329 --> 01:24:46.750]  He made one major mistake.
[01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:50.350]  That was the selection of George H.W. Bush as vice president.
[01:24:50.550 --> 01:25:05.470]  That put in place the ultimate takeover of both major parties by a globalist neocon elite whose priorities are control and making huge profits from war.
[01:25:05.850 --> 01:25:12.810]  We have right now A historic opportunity to reset that balance.
[01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:31.810]  An entirely new coalition is emerging here in which Dick Cheney and the McCains and Adam Kinzinger and those who put a premium on war have endorsed Kamala Harris,
[01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:41.699]  who is the candidate of endless war, while Robert F. Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbard And great Democrats like Rob Blagojevich have endorsed Donald Trump.
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:46.060]  This is a historic opportunity to change everything.
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:48.220]  This is not the old Republican Party.
[01:25:49.279 --> 01:25:49.939]  Pardon me.
[01:25:50.039 --> 01:25:51.899]  Not the party of Wall Street.
[01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:53.180]  Not the party of the wealthy.
[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:54.680]  Not the party of the country clubs.
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:56.899]  This is the party of working people.
[01:25:57.119 --> 01:25:59.859]  This is the party of the common man.
[01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:02.180]  This is the party that will put America first.
[01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:12.060]  And this is the party that will not only make us great again, in terms of making us both strong and prosperous, but also make us healthy again.
[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:16.100]  It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reclaim America.
[01:26:16.199 --> 01:26:18.560]  This time will never come again.
[01:26:19.359 --> 01:26:27.399]  I saw my friend Laura Loomer online today criticizing Robert Kennedy's campaign because they're still raising money.
[01:26:27.939 --> 01:26:34.720]  But I also got calls from friends in Michigan and Wisconsin who are friends of mine who are Kennedy supporters.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:40.260]  Both said they got a phone call today from the Kennedy campaign urging them to vote for Donald Trump.
[01:26:40.439 --> 01:26:42.760]  So I think they are doing the right thing.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:27:01.279]  I can't tell people how important This realignment, this unique opportunity for realignment is we either succeed or we don't, which is why the Democrats who fought so hard to keep RFK off the ballot as a Democrat, then they fought to keep him off the ballot as an independent,
[01:27:01.739 --> 01:27:06.300]  then they fought to keep him on the ballot in Michigan and Wisconsin.
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:07.939]  It is disgraceful.
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:16.119]  Well, I mean, I'm here listening to you and just thinking about 30 years on air, your 50 years in politics in this republic, and it's never been clear.
[01:27:16.279 --> 01:27:22.659]  I mean, the Democratic Party are like chi-com, foam-at-the-mouth, crazy megalomaniac lunatics.
[01:27:22.939 --> 01:27:24.079]  They even try to list all their evil.
[01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:24.720]  Everybody knows it.
[01:27:24.779 --> 01:27:25.579]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:27.619]  It's fabulously corrupt.
[01:27:28.319 --> 01:27:32.159]  And just so cartoonishly wicked that I just marvel at it.
[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:33.039]  It's ridiculous.
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:43.880]  And they're just openly running around talking about civil war and murdering everybody and armed insurrection while saying we're going to kill them with the military while they have the military authorized for civil war and killing citizens.
[01:27:44.829 --> 01:27:47.210]  That would be such a scandal if anybody else did it.
[01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.810]  It should be.
[01:27:48.010 --> 01:27:49.069]  If Trump did it, I'd be against him.
[01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:51.670]  I mean, this is just crazy town.
[01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:55.170]  And I don't even know what to say at this point.
[01:27:55.210 --> 01:27:59.710]  And then not letting the troops vote for the first time in U.S. history and all the other crap.
[01:27:59.850 --> 01:28:01.329]  I mean, this is wild.
[01:28:01.489 --> 01:28:05.590]  And then World War III is on the ballot basically as a referendum.
[01:28:06.090 --> 01:28:07.630]  I mean, this is wild.
[01:28:08.609 --> 01:28:12.869]  Well, Alex, I've never seen a presidential campaign, and I've been in 13 of them.
[01:28:13.549 --> 01:28:21.090]  Where the campaign doesn't have any positive, uplifting, constructive message for the close.
[01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:23.210]  I mean, Trump has told you exactly what he's going to do.
[01:28:23.409 --> 01:28:27.069]  He's going to unleash our energy potential.
[01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:28.829]  We're going to drill baby drill.
[01:28:29.130 --> 01:28:37.270]  We're going to go back to being not only energy independent, but we're going to become the world's largest provider of energy around the world.
[01:28:37.529 --> 01:28:43.369]  That, he knows, is the keystone to unleashing the most robust economy we will ever have.
[01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:51.449]  He's going to get rid of the tax on tips, which helps working people enormously because tips are a gratuity.
[01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:53.149]  They're not for a service rendered.
[01:28:53.409 --> 01:28:54.710]  Should be taxed anyway.
[01:28:55.029 --> 01:28:57.529]  He's going to end the tax on Social Security.
[01:28:57.850 --> 01:29:02.210]  These are constructive, positive ideas to get the economy moving.
[01:29:02.979 --> 01:29:08.439]  Her closing message is, Donald Trump is Hitler and anybody who supports him is a Nazi.
[01:29:08.699 --> 01:29:09.439]  That's it.
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:11.600]  That's her closing message.
[01:29:11.739 --> 01:29:15.119]  Because she has no positive message for the country.
[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:24.439]  No uplifting vision for where she wants to take us, other than her own admission She said it and Biden has said it.
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:25.720]  More of the same.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:28.840]  The exact same policies that have brought us to where we are today.
[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:35.720]  And these job numbers that they released, first of all, they're woefully less than were predicted.
[01:29:36.819 --> 01:29:40.140]  And frankly, they're probably wrong too because we've seen this pattern.
[01:29:40.279 --> 01:29:41.319]  They put the numbers out.
[01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:42.520]  They get the big headlines.
[01:29:43.079 --> 01:29:46.380]  Then two weeks later, they admit, well, we were wrong.
[01:29:46.659 --> 01:29:49.020]  Well, wait, I mean, they already admitted the new job numbers were fake this week.
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:52.279]  It doesn't take very long, does it?
[01:29:52.859 --> 01:29:57.079]  And most of the jobs they're creating are not even full-time jobs.
[01:29:57.199 --> 01:29:58.439]  They're part-time jobs.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:01.859]  So they're running on empty.
[01:30:01.979 --> 01:30:03.079]  They're running on fear.
[01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:12.300]  You're also in this final stage of the campaign where they'll take anything that Trump says, anything that he says, and twist it.
[01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:16.750]  No, he did not say he wanted to put Liz Cheney in front of a firing squad.
[01:30:16.989 --> 01:30:27.810]  What he said was, maybe those who want to rush headlong into war wouldn't be so anxious to be at war if they were the ones who are on the front lines instead of sending our children.
[01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:29.689]  That was the essence of what he said.
[01:30:30.329 --> 01:30:31.689]  And by the way, let me stop you.
[01:30:31.810 --> 01:30:43.670]  I made the point Thursday and Friday when this came out that this is the cliche of hippies to say, all you hawks and chicken hawks that love war so much, you should go face the guns of the enemy, not our men and women in uniform.
[01:30:43.810 --> 01:30:46.350]  And Bill Maher said the exact same thing Friday night.
[01:30:46.369 --> 01:30:46.989]  Here's a short clip.
[01:30:48.239 --> 01:30:50.300]  What do you make of the statement?
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:56.260]  I woke up today to the headline that Trump had called for a firing squad for Liz Cheney.
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:59.460]  And this is what I really don't like about the media.
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:00.659]  No, he didn't.
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:04.380]  You don't have to move me to not like Donald Trump.
[01:31:04.539 --> 01:31:06.300]  He says so many shitty things.
[01:31:06.539 --> 01:31:07.159]  Why do you have to do that?
[01:31:07.159 --> 01:31:09.680]  And by the way, if you don't realize it, here's what he says.
[01:31:09.859 --> 01:31:11.720]  He's criticizing him for being a war hawk.
[01:31:11.739 --> 01:31:13.039]  I mean, she is Dick Cheney's daughter.
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.770]  He said, She's a radical war hawk.
[01:31:15.850 --> 01:31:19.930]  Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, okay?
[01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:21.670]  Let's see how she feels about it.
[01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:30.850]  You know, they're all war hawks when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, oh, gee, we'll send tens of thousands of troops right into the mouth of the enemy.
[01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:33.210]  Now, of course, he expresses himself horribly.
[01:31:33.210 --> 01:31:36.350]  He has to add she's a stupid person because he's a moron.
[01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:37.829]  Well, Trump knows what it's really like from Vietnam.
[01:31:38.729 --> 01:31:39.170]  Okay.
[01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:48.220]  Just to be clear, this is exactly what hippies always said.
[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:50.539]  This is exactly what Peace Vicks always said.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:52.579]  This is Fortunate Son, the song.
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.119]  It's like, you know what?
[01:31:54.199 --> 01:31:59.159]  It's very easy to sit in your building and send young men to die, apropos of Ukraine.
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:31:59.579]  Yes.
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:02.880]  Because, I don't know, that war doesn't look like it's going in the right direction.
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:03.079]  No.
[01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:06.689]  But just so, you know, just don't lie to me.
[01:32:06.829 --> 01:32:08.350]  I don't like Donald Trump.
[01:32:08.569 --> 01:32:13.090]  Don't lie to me and tell me he wants it in front of a firing court.
[01:32:13.170 --> 01:32:23.750]  He was saying something that, by the way, if it came out of the mouth, some of it, not the stupid part, again, sounds like what hippies used to say about not sending people to...
[01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:24.109]  Yes?
[01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:25.609]  I agree with you on the lying.
[01:32:25.930 --> 01:32:29.829]  I mean, that is ridiculous and absurd and counterproductive.
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:33.779]  What's crazy is Jamie Raskin is one of the top globalists.
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.000]  His dad's a famous communist.
[01:32:36.199 --> 01:32:42.880]  Raskin came out and attacked Trump and went along with the lie that he said killed Cheney.
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:44.319]  And now he's up there saying it's ridiculous.
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:45.859]  That guy's a total fraud.
[01:32:45.899 --> 01:32:48.180]  And by the way, he's one of the main brains, isn't he, Roger?
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:50.500]  He's one of the guys planning all this crap, isn't he?
[01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:54.649]  Well, first of all, his wife, of course, was an NSA official.
[01:32:54.829 --> 01:32:57.810]  She's the one who illegally unmasked General Flynn and others.
[01:32:58.970 --> 01:33:01.869]  She's now a federal judge, of course.
[01:33:02.329 --> 01:33:10.810]  She and the congressman inadvertently failed to report millions of dollars of stock gains that they made during their federal service.
[01:33:11.109 --> 01:33:19.329]  He's also the same guy who defamed me regarding January 6th, which I have nothing to do with anything that transpired at the Capitol.
[01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:24.630]  He said otherwise, but produced no evidence because there's no evidence to produce.
[01:33:25.449 --> 01:33:27.670]  I see this other canard coming out.
[01:33:27.909 --> 01:33:32.069]  So they're saying, Trump is going to prematurely declare victory.
[01:33:32.069 --> 01:33:33.390]  We have to be prepared for that.
[01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:34.970]  This has some historical context.
[01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:44.680]  I did say, most definitely, on a video four years ago, that if it's up in the air, if it's undecided that Trump is ahead, that he should declare victory.
[01:33:44.819 --> 01:33:56.960]  This is, of course, consistent with what Secretary of State James A. Baker told George W. Bush in, I guess it was 2000, what Ambassador Joseph Kennedy told his son.
[01:33:57.119 --> 01:33:59.600]  It's standard American political procedure.
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:01.520]  Exactly.
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:03.199]  But here's what I did not say.
[01:34:03.319 --> 01:34:07.100]  I did not say if Trump loses, he should declare victory.
[01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:08.100]  That's not what I said.
[01:34:08.239 --> 01:34:09.319]  Go back and look at the tape.
[01:34:09.479 --> 01:34:13.520]  But that's what they claim you said because they twist everything you said.
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:17.000]  Well, listen, right now, Raskin, as you know, is saying they're not going to certify.
[01:34:17.079 --> 01:34:17.720]  They're going to block it.
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:18.399]  It's going to go on forever.
[01:34:18.539 --> 01:34:19.840]  They're going to have civil war conditions.
[01:34:20.650 --> 01:34:22.409]  And all the other surrogates are.
[01:34:22.569 --> 01:34:25.609]  And then he says Trump's not going to accept it and is going to steal it.
[01:34:25.710 --> 01:34:29.909]  And so he said on Bill Maher, we've got to get out with our lawyers and stop him from stealing it.
[01:34:30.109 --> 01:34:32.909]  Translation, they're going to try to use their lawyers to steal it as you predicted.
[01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:45.810]  Yeah, so this whole thing is them trying to blunt the fact that it's quite likely we may see that Donald Trump is going to win on Tuesday night.
[01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:48.470]  That's why we have this prolonged process.
[01:34:48.670 --> 01:35:02.810]  Yeah, it disturbs me when the Secretary of State of Michigan and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania jointly say, before the voting is over, that it's going to take us many days to determine who the winners are.
[01:35:02.850 --> 01:35:03.729]  How could we know that?
[01:35:03.949 --> 01:35:07.109]  I mean, this is a computerized system, as I said at the beginning.
[01:35:07.409 --> 01:35:16.069]  If France can count 38 million paper ballots in one day, the French, who can't do much, why can't we do it here in the United States?
[01:35:16.069 --> 01:35:16.770]  Roger, Roger.
[01:35:16.909 --> 01:35:21.390]  I'm sure you know this, but Naomi Wolfman, I think it's the 16th, but she's on next hour.
[01:35:21.489 --> 01:35:21.930]  I'll ask her again.
[01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:31.399]  Jamie Raskin, a month ago, set up a big symposium in D.C. about an election undecided in chaos for a week and a half after the election.
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:34.000]  So they're saying that's their plan.
[01:35:34.119 --> 01:35:34.800]  So finish on that.
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:37.479]  Then I want to put the cart before the horse, but we're so close now.
[01:35:37.539 --> 01:35:37.939]  We've got to talk about it.
[01:35:37.979 --> 01:35:40.760]  Let's say Trump wins Tuesday night, decisively, or a few days after.
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:42.340]  It's such a landslide they can't overpower it.
[01:35:42.579 --> 01:35:44.680]  All these polls are now saying, and I'll show you that in a moment.
[01:35:44.699 --> 01:35:46.399]  I'm sure you obviously know, but the listeners...
[01:35:47.619 --> 01:35:53.039]  What about when the 76 days of him president-elect when they're promising uprisings and trying to block him?
[01:35:53.539 --> 01:35:56.300]  Then in the time we have left, let's speak to that after you finish your other point.
[01:35:57.439 --> 01:36:00.640]  Well, look, again, I think there's a couple of important things.
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:03.600]  First and foremost, everybody needs to vote.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.920]  Too big to rig is not just a slogan.
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:14.479]  You make it much more difficult for them to actually execute any of these shenanigans with an overwhelming vote.
[01:36:14.659 --> 01:36:17.300]  And the polling indicates the votes are out there.
[01:36:17.630 --> 01:36:22.810]  So even in states that are thought to be safe, like Florida is thought to be in the Trump column.
[01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:25.529]  Trump won here pretty solidly in 2020.
[01:36:25.670 --> 01:36:29.970]  But there are two constitutional amendments on the ballot, Amendment 3, Amendment 4.
[01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:34.210]  One is the legalization of cannabis, which I'm actually supporting.
[01:36:34.409 --> 01:36:36.810]  So is President Trump, many libertarians.
[01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:40.670]  But there's an abortion amendment on the ballot here.
[01:36:40.810 --> 01:36:44.569]  These are designed to bring out more Democrat voters and so on.
[01:36:44.829 --> 01:36:50.729]  So, if you live in Florida, don't sit back and say, oh, Trump's got this in the bag, I don't need to vote.
[01:36:51.090 --> 01:36:54.810]  I tell people, go through your cell phone, go through your list of contacts.
[01:36:54.989 --> 01:37:09.050]  Every single person watching Infowars right now knows five people who would vote for Trump, but for one reason or another weren't planning to, or don't think it's important, or don't think it's close, or think it's going to be a landslide.
[01:37:09.870 --> 01:37:11.029]  Do not think that.
[01:37:11.229 --> 01:37:14.670]  This is going to be skin tight, skin tight in my opinion.
[01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:16.010]  All right.
[01:37:17.029 --> 01:37:18.489]  Let's look at these polls here.
[01:37:18.829 --> 01:37:20.529]  I want to ask you about that.
[01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:24.710]  Head pollster Rasmussen predicts Trump landslide.
[01:37:24.930 --> 01:37:28.010]  Trump pollster predicts Trump landslide, sweeping battleground states.
[01:37:28.649 --> 01:37:30.529]  Holly Market has got him way ahead.
[01:37:30.989 --> 01:37:37.229]  Liberal data analyst Nat Silbert says Trump favored to win, accuses pollsters of putting finger on the scale to make elections seem closer.
[01:37:37.949 --> 01:37:38.829]  That's out.
[01:37:39.289 --> 01:37:42.890]  Democrats drafting impeachment articles in anticipation of his election.
[01:37:43.170 --> 01:37:44.390]  So there are already...
[01:37:45.069 --> 01:37:56.770]  Preparing for a defeat, and I think the confidence game that Patrick Byrd, which I believe, got from inside of Harris, inside an actual meeting two days ago, saying, don't worry, we're going to win.
[01:37:56.869 --> 01:38:04.189]  That's just them, with a rearguard action, telling their troops, oh no, we're going to win, just so they keep operating and believe that, kind of like Hillary was doing in 2016.
[01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.710]  What do you think?
[01:38:05.689 --> 01:38:10.510]  Well, it could be, or it could be that they have some massive fraud prepared.
[01:38:10.750 --> 01:38:32.810]  But just like I was criticized when I said, look, in Michigan, when they use the Detroit police to remove the Republican observers, they lock the doors and they continue counting, it's crucial that the Republicans know how to reach the federal duty judge on duty that night to file an emergency motion.
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:36.640]  Oh, Stone says judges are going to fix the election.
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:37.479]  That's not what I said.
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:38.380]  That's not what I said.
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:41.479]  But no one even knew how to reach a judge.
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:44.760]  None of the Republican lawyers knew what to do in that instance.
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:46.760]  This year, we are much better prepared.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:48.520]  There is a legal procedure.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:51.180]  This election could get decided in the courts.
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:54.739]  If there's a dispute, that's where it must be decided.
[01:38:54.939 --> 01:38:57.840]  But this time, we are much, much better prepared to do that.
[01:38:58.039 --> 01:39:05.560]  So I think if we had a free, fair, and totally honest election, Trump would win, not by a landslide, but by a comfortable margin.
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:09.659]  Because we're not going to have that, but we're going to have something much closer to it.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.319]  I think Trump is on a victory trajectory.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:28.479]  The polling shows you that if you look at voters' perceptions of the two candidates and their ability to handle the most important issues—inflation, war, gas prices, food prices, and so on—they overwhelmingly picked Trump.
[01:39:28.739 --> 01:39:32.899]  I saw the same thing with Ronald Reagan in the closing days of the 1980 campaign.
[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:34.699]  I feel pretty good.
[01:39:34.699 --> 01:39:48.420]  If everybody does their job, I believe that 45 will follow another great New Yorker, Grover Cleveland, the only president to serve, then lose a disputed re-election and come back to win again.
[01:39:48.899 --> 01:39:52.640]  Trump, a New Yorker, is about to pull out the hat trick, I believe.
[01:39:53.079 --> 01:39:55.439]  Roger, 90 seconds left.
[01:39:55.619 --> 01:39:56.300]  Other key intel.
[01:39:58.399 --> 01:40:05.100]  You know, at this point, Alex, I think that the president is working as hard as humanly possible.
[01:40:05.119 --> 01:40:07.640]  You could see anybody would be tired.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.699]  The man's energy is incredible.
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:14.640]  I mean, talking to people on the plane, I say, how's he doing?
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:15.960]  They said, you just wouldn't believe it.
[01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:18.479]  The guy is just, he is really fired up.
[01:40:19.079 --> 01:40:21.420]  He's tired, but he's feeling good.
[01:40:21.909 --> 01:40:23.250]  He is superhuman, man.
[01:40:23.369 --> 01:40:24.689]  He is the man of steel.
[01:40:24.869 --> 01:40:25.670]  He really is.
[01:40:26.369 --> 01:40:28.409]  And I'm proud to be for him.
[01:40:28.710 --> 01:40:37.789]  And I'm proud for the fact that he could have just ridden off into the sunset and played at the most beautiful golf courses in the country and played with his grandchildren and had a great life.
[01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:40.319]  This has cost him billions of dollars.
[01:40:40.819 --> 01:40:47.760]  It has sheared off half the people in the country who now hate him because they've been fed lies about him by the fake news media.
[01:40:48.079 --> 01:40:49.920]  He really is a great patriot.
[01:40:50.079 --> 01:40:51.500]  He's not doing it for himself, folks.
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:52.939]  He's doing it for us.
[01:40:53.079 --> 01:40:54.600]  He's doing it because he loves the country.
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:56.520]  That's why I'm proud to be for him.
[01:40:56.659 --> 01:40:58.020]  And Alex, I'm proud to be with you tonight.
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:00.640]  I apologize for coughing my way through this.
[01:41:00.859 --> 01:41:02.300]  I got a nasty cold.
[01:41:02.619 --> 01:41:04.460]  Hey, I know you're working your ass off.
[01:41:05.239 --> 01:41:06.300]  StoneZone.com.
[01:41:06.439 --> 01:41:07.220]  Roger is amazing.
[01:41:07.359 --> 01:41:09.119]  Everybody follow him and all his great programs and what he does.
[01:41:09.239 --> 01:41:10.619]  Roger, we'll be talking to you election night.
[01:41:11.119 --> 01:41:14.800]  We'll be talking to you just everywhere as this all unfolds.
[01:41:14.899 --> 01:41:16.119]  Thank you so much, my friend.
[01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:16.699]  God bless you.
[01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:22.630]  All right, I'm going to start the third hour, and Naomi Wolf's going to be co-hosting.
[01:41:22.729 --> 01:41:30.510]  I'm going to hand the baton to her, and then Chase Geyser's going to be riding shotgun, you know, kind of just the training wheels in case there's any problems with her video connection.
[01:41:30.649 --> 01:41:35.930]  He'll be here with her, and he's hosting in the fourth hour, loaded for bear with tons of clips, and the data boiled down.
[01:41:36.050 --> 01:41:39.869]  It is some of the best information we put out is the great Chase Geyser show.
[01:41:40.449 --> 01:41:48.050]  We've got two hours coming up right now at Real Alex Jones at InfoWars at AJ... In live.
[01:41:48.210 --> 01:41:50.050]  That's the Alex Jones network that's backed up.
[01:41:50.329 --> 01:41:52.350]  All of that coming up next hour.
[01:41:52.529 --> 01:41:53.850]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:41:53.949 --> 01:41:54.569]  Radio stations everywhere.
[01:41:54.909 --> 01:41:56.010]  Be sure and join us.
[01:41:56.090 --> 01:42:00.050]  And remember, I'm fighting the globalists and I need money to fight them.
[01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:01.430]  And it came out in the New York Times.
[01:42:01.529 --> 01:42:02.930]  Alex Jones doesn't have all this money.
[01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:04.270]  He has meager assets.
[01:42:04.710 --> 01:42:05.529]  Yeah, it was all a lie.
[01:42:05.630 --> 01:42:06.149]  They knew that.
[01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:08.430]  So you wouldn't support me so they could try to shut us down.
[01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:09.369]  But the truth's there.
[01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:21.989]  If you'll just go get great t-shirts and great supplements and great products at our sponsor that's separate from InfoWars that will continue on, thealexjonesstore.com, CMOS, incredible superfood, Ultimate CMOS, all the other great supplements that are there right now.
[01:42:22.090 --> 01:42:26.210]  Something just as good as Vitamineral Fusion that's excellent, by the way, is the new HydroForce.
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:32.100]  That's got the electrolytes on top of the vitamins and minerals, pre-workout, post-workout, just great for everybody, old, young, you name it.
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:40.640]  It's all there, thealexjonesstore.com, incredible t-shirts, hoodies, hats, everything at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:48.439]  And my dad's a great supplement company with so many amazing supplements like Next Level Financial Energy, the fluoride-free special toothpaste with the nano-silver colloidal and all of it in there.
[01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:53.310]  Super Blue, that's all at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:42:53.590 --> 01:42:54.949]  That will keep us on the air as well.
[01:42:55.369 --> 01:42:56.069]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:59.109]  We'll be right back with our number three and four, Naomi Wolf, straight ahead.
[01:43:05.930 --> 01:43:08.489]  Epic times, history happening now.
[01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:19.050]  Never in my lifetime or I can imagine modern history has good and evil been so clearly defined and the choice so amazingly crystal clear.
[01:43:19.770 --> 01:43:20.409]  Dr.
[01:43:20.489 --> 01:43:22.630]  Naomi Wolf is an extremely respected author.
[01:43:23.559 --> 01:43:27.739]  Former high-level Democrat strategist, but I've been interviewing her for close to two decades.
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:40.180]  She and I were some of the first people to really warn of the encroaching police state and then the ongoing rotting of the Democratic Party, because back then the Republicans were just as bad, but then now there's a beachhead of populism with Trump.
[01:43:40.829 --> 01:43:44.670]  The Democratic Party and the neocons are allied against the American people.
[01:43:45.130 --> 01:43:47.289]  World War III is a referendum on the table.
[01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:50.750]  And so for the next hour, she joins us via remote.
[01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:54.489]  Chase Geyser will be here on the off chance there's any technical things with connections.
[01:43:54.510 --> 01:43:59.590]  And he's hosting the fourth hour tonight, always fast-moving with the great Chase Geyser.
[01:43:59.689 --> 01:44:01.470]  Then, massive coverage tomorrow.
[01:44:01.470 --> 01:44:04.250]  I'll be on after Owen until 10 o'clock at night.
[01:44:04.409 --> 01:44:05.689]  Look for those feeds.
[01:44:05.869 --> 01:44:07.510]  We're going to go overnight if needed.
[01:44:07.869 --> 01:44:08.869]  Tuesday night.
[01:44:09.300 --> 01:44:11.359]  The deep state has telegraphed their plans.
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:14.359]  Trump came out today and said, look, they're already trying to steal it.
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:16.460]  The exact quote is...
[01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:18.439]  I played it earlier.
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:21.420]  I mean, this is just absolutely insane.
[01:44:22.119 --> 01:44:25.479]  It is all unfolding in front of us.
[01:44:25.979 --> 01:44:29.619]  Trump said, they're fighting so hard to steal this damn thing.
[01:44:29.739 --> 01:44:31.340]  And people say, oh, don't be negative.
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:32.140]  You don't know.
[01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:34.079]  I mean, look, we have to admit what's going on.
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:34.760]  So...
[01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:37.010]  We're in the season of false flags.
[01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:41.390]  We have a desperate, dying, corrupt kleptocracy that we're trying to dislodge.
[01:44:41.550 --> 01:44:42.630]  The coup's already there.
[01:44:42.710 --> 01:44:43.949]  They already appointed Harris.
[01:44:44.210 --> 01:44:46.430]  Now they want to extend that out and legitimize it.
[01:44:47.409 --> 01:44:49.090]  Pray, too, for peace.
[01:44:49.529 --> 01:44:49.729]  Dr.
[01:44:49.810 --> 01:44:55.329]  Naomi Wolf takes over now, and she's got a new book out, the Pfizer Papers and more.
[01:44:55.649 --> 01:44:57.850]  She's so gracious to spend our Sunday evening with us.
[01:44:57.989 --> 01:44:59.270]  You look amazing.
[01:44:59.590 --> 01:45:00.250]  Thank you so much.
[01:45:00.250 --> 01:45:00.789]  You have the floor.
[01:45:01.729 --> 01:45:03.270]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:45:03.449 --> 01:45:08.770]  What an honor to be co-hosting Infowars and what a night.
[01:45:09.689 --> 01:45:12.729]  I'm sure you've been covering election irregularities.
[01:45:12.970 --> 01:45:28.210]  I just want to mention that what seems to be happening across the country is that there are the same kinds of irregularities, meaning cheating, various kinds of cheating that you and I talked about the last time we were together.
[01:45:28.699 --> 01:45:46.359]  That, as I mentioned, AI is so good now at manipulating and managing across the country, making it a little different state by state, a little tweaking here, tweaking there, producing virtually the ballots that are needed to make up for Trump ballots.
[01:45:47.119 --> 01:46:02.340]  But what's really interesting to me as a veteran of Really a veteran of 2000 when the first kind of modern contested election was sort of launched and also a citizen, you know,
[01:46:02.479 --> 01:46:11.859]  during 2020 is that what's clear is that the same kinds of things are happening as happened in 2020, but people are recording them.
[01:46:12.079 --> 01:46:23.550]  People are not intimidated by the mystique around ballots and reporting They've gotten more used to being citizen journalists.
[01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:30.170]  I've been beating the drum that, in many states, it's legal to photograph your ballot.
[01:46:30.430 --> 01:46:35.970]  I think Jack Basobiec has been saying, you know, videotape any irregularities that you see.
[01:46:36.069 --> 01:46:36.930]  There are apps.
[01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:43.810]  And I interviewed an election integrity activist, Steve Stern, who named some of these apps.
[01:46:43.810 --> 01:46:54.079]  They're really good, where you can upload examples of irregularities So people are being very, very proactive documenting bad things that are happening with the vote.
[01:46:54.220 --> 01:47:03.319]  And so as a result, President Trump, you know, is rightly calling out the way that the cheating is unfolding.
[01:47:03.579 --> 01:47:09.180]  He, quote unquote, leaned into the subject of election fraud today in Pennsylvania.
[01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:18.539]  But also it's so fascinating, Alex and audience, to watch The media, the legacy media, try to make this go away.
[01:47:19.579 --> 01:47:28.439]  So BBC, for instance, has said, oh, there's misinformation and Russian-produced videos.
[01:47:28.479 --> 01:47:32.340]  And they do mention some fake videos, you know, that they tracked down.
[01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:45.220]  But that doesn't mean there aren't hundreds of Real, identifiable, verifiable, entering the news stream, lawsuits underway, examples of cheating out there.
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:54.340]  So BBC is saying, is really blaming Trump and saying that voter fraud claims flood social media.
[01:47:54.779 --> 01:48:06.199]  There's a, quote, whirlwind of misinformation, which sows distrust as if we are not having distrust due to examples that we see and recognize that have been verified.
[01:48:06.630 --> 01:48:22.369]  Hundreds of incidents are leading people to lose faith in the process, says the BBC. NBC notes that 70% of Americans expect Trump to reject the vote if he loses,
[01:48:22.710 --> 01:48:24.369]  echoes of 2020.
[01:48:25.050 --> 01:48:28.810]  And then let's get into what's actually happening on the ground.
[01:48:29.010 --> 01:48:36.970]  In Georgia, as you may have already covered, but just to chime in myself, In Georgia, there's a lawsuit.
[01:48:37.289 --> 01:48:48.949]  The RNC and the Georgia GOP filed a federal lawsuit against county election officials for collecting ballots in person over the weekend.
[01:48:49.170 --> 01:48:50.550]  Totally illegal.
[01:48:51.010 --> 01:48:55.949]  Totally against the processes that they put in place, the official processes.
[01:48:56.670 --> 01:49:01.409]  And so, as I mentioned, Trump is complaining of fraud in Pennsylvania.
[01:49:01.710 --> 01:49:13.739]  The GOP and the Trump campaign said That buildings were being opened and that ballots were being accepted improperly.
[01:49:13.939 --> 01:49:16.340]  And so there's a fight on in Georgia.
[01:49:16.619 --> 01:49:30.920]  The RNC says ballots were received over the weekend and that they must now be separated from the ballots that have kind of been processed or being processed normally so that they can be counted carefully, you know, in the event of litigation going forward.
[01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:39.270]  And what's really, really interesting to me, Alex, is that the Harris campaign is, again, trying to poo-poo this.
[01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:45.630]  And in that article, the Harris campaign spokesperson said, this is quote-unquote very silly.
[01:49:45.850 --> 01:50:02.090]  So the wish of the American people or the citizens of Georgia, let's just take that state, to have their votes be properly submitted, properly accounted for, properly counted, under scrutiny with observers, is quote-unquote very silly.
[01:50:03.170 --> 01:50:22.539]  Additionally, there's a statement from the Harris campaign that they feel really good about where things are going, and I think it's really interesting that the head of the Harris campaign Stated kind of,
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:26.640]  you know, what you would call predictive programming, getting us ready for this.
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:31.520]  She already knows or claims that we're going to need extra time to count the votes.
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:32.619]  How does she know?
[01:50:32.819 --> 01:50:34.760]  It's not even election day, right?
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:35.819]  How does she know?
[01:50:35.899 --> 01:50:44.319]  It won't be a totally normal until 2020, or really maybe until 2000, election day in which people stand in line, vote.
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:46.720]  There are enough voting booths.
[01:50:46.779 --> 01:50:48.479]  There are enough staffers.
[01:50:48.779 --> 01:50:54.180]  The vote is done, turned in, polls close on election day, and we have a winner!
[01:50:54.319 --> 01:51:03.760]  The way it was virtually every election day except 2000, 2020, and they're claiming now, you know, of my lifetime in the modern era.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:10.319]  So she knows somehow magically through telepathy that they're going to need extra time to count the vote.
[01:51:10.439 --> 01:51:13.060]  So that is super nefarious.
[01:51:13.199 --> 01:51:28.140]  And I think it's just so interesting that as people document Again and again with their phones, like literally they're documenting screens changing from Harris to Trump, and they're using their cell phones.
[01:51:28.359 --> 01:51:30.640]  You know, again, I don't want to encourage anyone to break the law.
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:31.920]  I don't want to get arrested.
[01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:41.199]  There's a map on Daily Cloud that shows you where it's legal to photograph your ballot or your voting process as you vote.
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:43.279]  Some states it's unclear.
[01:51:43.279 --> 01:51:46.220]  I would say if it's not illegal, it's legal.
[01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:49.380]  Because these documents belong to us by law.
[01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:54.779]  And in some states it's not legal, which we can, you know, bring those lawsuits after the election.
[01:51:55.119 --> 01:51:56.460]  But you should check.
[01:51:56.680 --> 01:52:13.020]  Point is, I think this is having a good impact because it's clear that there's intentions to cheat, that citizens are thwarting by being vigilant, documenting, being very sophisticated as citizen journalists,
[01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:15.859]  meaning you got to say who, what, where, when.
[01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:22.850]  You know, this what county, what polling place, what time, you know, ideally add your name if you're willing.
[01:52:24.090 --> 01:52:33.869]  And by doing this, by creating this transparency, it's clear that there's a fight on the ground, but citizens have a chance of derailing the worst of it.
[01:52:34.810 --> 01:52:36.810]  Shall I go on from there?
[01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:39.210]  Yeah, I'll continue.
[01:52:39.369 --> 01:52:39.710]  Absolutely.
[01:52:40.250 --> 01:52:42.130]  So this is...
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:55.800]  I don't know, disturbing still to me because even if all the votes are quote-unquote counted correctly, there are some things that we just can't wish away.
[01:52:56.140 --> 01:53:06.279]  I mean, something I want you all to note, and I don't want it to discourage you from going to the polls if you haven't yet, if you haven't yet voted.
[01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:08.199]  You know, you've got to get up.
[01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:09.939]  You've got to get off your couch.
[01:53:10.159 --> 01:53:11.500]  You've got to get to the polls.
[01:53:11.659 --> 01:53:13.399]  You've got to vote in person, ideally.
[01:53:13.810 --> 01:53:21.090]  You know, bring your friends, bring your neighbors, bring your knitting group, bring your book club, go to the polls.
[01:53:21.369 --> 01:53:26.550]  You know, it's more important than ever that you physically go.
[01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:31.289]  Bring water, you know, bring a folding chair.
[01:53:31.609 --> 01:53:33.789]  Jack Posobiec has really good practical advice.
[01:53:34.109 --> 01:53:39.890]  You may be standing there for hours, which again is, you know, unheard of most of my life as a voter.
[01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:51.119]  But what still worries me a lot is the complicity of Republicans as well as Democrats in not fixing the situation in advance.
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:54:02.100]  Because even if everyone votes and everyone records their messed up ballot process, everyone turns it in.
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:11.649]  The bottom line is people really need to understand that The machines can read whatever they want, okay?
[01:54:11.829 --> 01:54:14.810]  And I'm just going to take a moment to explain machine reading.
[01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:29.390]  Machine reading, okay, when you go to a supermarket and you get six oranges and four bananas, if there's a human being, the human being has to count six oranges and four bananas.
[01:54:29.550 --> 01:54:30.430]  That's human counting.
[01:54:31.170 --> 01:54:42.930]  If you're machine reading, you can have a little barcode on each of those pieces of fruit That identify seven of them as bananas.
[01:54:43.770 --> 01:54:55.210]  And then even if it's six oranges and three bananas, the machine will scan it as seven bananas and two oranges, okay?
[01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:58.670]  And it doesn't matter what the fruit is, right?
[01:54:58.850 --> 01:55:00.430]  The machine reads the barcode.
[01:55:00.729 --> 01:55:19.760]  So by the same token, you've got to understand that Just because you're putting a paper ballot into a machine like we do here in the Hudson Valley in New York State, it doesn't mean the machine is going to read what you intended it to read,
[01:55:19.939 --> 01:55:20.420]  right?
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:22.119]  Let me give you an example.
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:35.920]  We assume, because we've all taken standardized tests that are read digitally, that when you fill in those little bubbles with a pencil, That's what the machine is going to read.
[01:55:36.119 --> 01:55:43.220]  But we've been getting at DailyCloud, we've got a portal where you can upload a photograph of your ballot so that there's a citizen's archive.
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:50.260]  Well, we've been getting a lot of ballots that have code around the perimeter of the ballot.
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:52.699]  Now, we don't know what it means.
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:56:07.029]  I talked to our developer and he said, unless, and I understand this as a tech CEO, unless you have the algorithm, unless you have the source code, Meaning what the machine was told to read, right?
[01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:12.609]  You have no idea what this code around the perimeter of the ballot means.
[01:56:13.229 --> 01:56:28.529]  But it's very possible, it's very easy for the code in the machine to tell the machine to read what's around the perimeter rather than read the bubbles that you've filled in with your pencil.
[01:56:28.729 --> 01:56:33.090]  And what's around the perimeter could be read this as a Harris vote, right?
[01:56:33.399 --> 01:56:38.399]  Or read, you know, three Harris votes to two Trump votes.
[01:56:38.739 --> 01:56:45.119]  We don't know, because the code is proprietary in these machines.
[01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:59.260]  So this is why I said to Alex Jones the last time I was on the show, we can't know since 2005 who's won the American elections, or really elections in any country where they use machines.
[01:57:00.939 --> 01:57:05.899]  The source code can be told to read anything, right?
[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:07.000]  We don't know.
[01:57:07.199 --> 01:57:20.340]  It could literally, it's possible that the code says literally read every four pieces of paper as Harris and every, you know, fifth and sixth piece of paper as Trump.
[01:57:20.619 --> 01:57:21.720]  We don't know.
[01:57:21.899 --> 01:57:39.079]  And so really it doesn't matter that much what you put into the machine, which is why it's so important for you To photograph your ballot if you possibly can, keep a record of what you voted for in case it is adjudicated its evidence.
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:55.920]  And only when we, after this is all over, pass legislation to get rid of the machines, only have paper ballots, same-day voting, in-person voting, no ballot harvesting, only citizens voting, voter ID, public counting,
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:58:08.760]  which is the way it used to be, In America in the 19th century until the early 20th century, election day ended with the votes, paper votes being counted on a raised dais in the middle of the town square.
[01:58:09.300 --> 01:58:11.159]  Everyone watched, right?
[01:58:11.439 --> 01:58:13.039]  That's what we need to bring back.
[01:58:13.479 --> 01:58:17.659]  But I'm just alerting you to that because, you know, we have to be vigilant.
[01:58:17.819 --> 01:58:18.960]  This is not over.
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:25.659]  You know, after election day, we have to get rid of these machines and you really should document your vote.
[01:58:25.979 --> 01:58:35.729]  If it's not legal, To, you know, do anything with that image of your vote, just keep it, you know, personally as an archive in case there's litigation, all right?
[01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:41.829]  So then the other thing I would say, and by the way, I'm not telling you to break the law, all right?
[01:58:42.029 --> 01:58:43.409]  I'm not telling you to break the law.
[01:58:44.229 --> 01:59:00.239]  The other thing I would say is that it's very clear that the Democrats and the legacy media are trying to Demonize the act of questioning the election outcome.
[01:59:00.899 --> 01:59:17.000]  And this, to me, again, as someone who was an advisor to Vice President Gore in 2000, that contested election, many of you may be too young to remember, that that election was fought over right up to the Supreme Court and not decided until five weeks later.
[01:59:17.279 --> 01:59:26.180]  And there was all kinds of arguments about, at that time, the paper ballots, the hanging chads, You know, what do we do with the hanging chads, right?
[01:59:26.699 --> 01:59:28.180]  Are there enough observers?
[01:59:28.899 --> 01:59:35.920]  And it was ultimately decided on a paper-thin majority in one state.
[01:59:36.380 --> 01:59:44.579]  Well, the reason I bring this up is everything that the Gore team and everything that the Bush Jr.
[01:59:44.899 --> 01:59:51.899]  team did from Election Day on till the vote was decided five weeks later would put them in jail today.
[01:59:53.220 --> 02:00:09.279]  In other words, retroactively, the act of challenging the vote, making sure every vote is counted, making sure that all the legal processes are gone through, you know, bringing the lawsuits if necessary, going right up court after court.
[02:00:09.439 --> 02:00:11.460]  That is not terrorism.
[02:00:11.939 --> 02:00:14.060]  That is not criminal behavior.
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:18.640]  That is how our system is supposed to work.
[02:00:18.939 --> 02:00:21.359]  That is how our system is supposed to work.
[02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:23.699]  Every vote is supposed to be counted.
[02:00:24.159 --> 02:00:30.380]  People are supposed to challenge the outcome if they think that even one vote has not been properly counted.
[02:00:30.579 --> 02:00:39.779]  And they're supposed to go right up legally, peacefully, you know, a municipality, you know, precinct, municipality, state, Supreme Court.
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:42.220]  That is the way it is supposed to be done.
[02:00:42.439 --> 02:00:47.619]  And Vice President Gore consulted with his lawyers continually.
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:54.039]  Right from Election Day on until the day he conceded after the Supreme Court ruling.
[02:00:54.619 --> 02:00:58.699]  And George Bush also consulted with his lawyers.
[02:00:58.899 --> 02:01:07.680]  Well, what is President Trump and Steve Bannon and other people who talked about, was there fraud?
[02:01:07.899 --> 02:01:09.100]  Should we contest the vote?
[02:01:09.579 --> 02:01:13.079]  Those conversations have been criminalized.
[02:01:13.239 --> 02:01:18.479]  And the DOD directive That says that the military can shoot Americans.
[02:01:18.779 --> 02:01:25.159]  I believe that one context in which that's possible is challenging the vote.
[02:01:25.699 --> 02:01:34.239]  And right now you can hear the drumbeat of even challenging the vote, even asking, was my vote counted?
[02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:37.880]  Or as the candidate, have the votes been properly counted?
[02:01:38.079 --> 02:01:43.020]  Let's go through all the legal processes to make sure that every single American's vote was counted.
[02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:45.810]  That itself is being criminalized.
[02:01:45.930 --> 02:01:48.449]  And they set the stage for that in 2020.
[02:01:48.909 --> 02:01:52.430]  Remember, they said Trump's baseless claims.
[02:01:52.630 --> 02:01:55.489]  You heard it in the BBC article I quoted to you.
[02:01:55.770 --> 02:01:59.329]  You know, Trump is sowing distrust.
[02:01:59.550 --> 02:02:01.590]  Trump is sowing distrust.
[02:02:01.729 --> 02:02:08.890]  We are supposed to distrust the outcome until every single vote is properly counted.
[02:02:09.170 --> 02:02:11.390]  Every irregularity is examined.
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:15.020]  Every observer gets to examine every vote.
[02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:20.199]  Every lawyer gets to look at every possible challenge.
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:24.619]  Every judge gets to roll up all the way to the Supreme Court.
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:27.439]  That is how our system is supposed to work.
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:35.979]  So what they're trying to do, the legacy media and the Harris administration, is make us forget our civics classes.
[02:02:36.319 --> 02:02:38.180]  And they don't even teach civics anymore.
[02:02:38.850 --> 02:02:42.130]  Those of us over 50, they're making us forget our civics classes.
[02:02:42.409 --> 02:02:48.109]  Those of us under 50 probably don't even know that you are supposed to count every vote.
[02:02:48.250 --> 02:02:50.850]  You're supposed to challenge every regularity.
[02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:53.130]  That's your civic duty.
[02:02:53.289 --> 02:03:05.670]  That's how elections are supposed to be decided, not through a network, not through CNN making a call, not through exit polls, not through someone conceding prematurely.
[02:03:05.710 --> 02:03:06.069]  No.
[02:03:06.619 --> 02:03:09.840]  They are supposed to count every vote and go through every...
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:12.539]  I'm sorry, I'm so, you know, emotional about this.
[02:03:12.579 --> 02:03:16.439]  I'm like repeating myself, but I'm reminding everyone that is our right.
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:31.000]  And they're trying to say that doing that is an act of subversion or an act of civil provocation or, you know, they're trying to say that the only way to be a good citizen is to be told who won.
[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:33.260]  And then even if you have...
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:51.420]  Millions of questions or even if you yourself had a bad experience or problematic or unjust experience at the polling places like the people in Bucks County, Pennsylvania who couldn't even get in to vote because they closed the polls early,
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:51.859]  right?
[02:03:52.340 --> 02:04:02.739]  Or even if you witnessed yourself The flipping of the person you were trying to vote for to someone else, or even if you saw the misspelling of your candidate, right?
[02:04:02.939 --> 02:04:06.579]  You are supposed to sit down and shut up and take it.
[02:04:06.699 --> 02:04:12.180]  And that's the only way to not be a domestic terrorist, or that's the only way to be a good citizen.
[02:04:12.340 --> 02:04:15.399]  And I'm just here to remind you that that is not true.
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:17.859]  They're trying to make it true, but it is not true.
[02:04:18.039 --> 02:04:19.779]  It's not how our system is supposed to work.
[02:04:21.239 --> 02:04:22.800]  Let me go on.
[02:04:24.439 --> 02:04:31.939]  I think that what's going to happen is that there's going to be election day tomorrow, right?
[02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:44.039]  I think that infiltrators, as on January 6th, are going to create violent scenes or disruption.
[02:04:45.239 --> 02:04:54.319]  I fear that there will be bomb threats, for instance, or You know, the power going out.
[02:04:54.460 --> 02:04:56.720]  I think that, by the way, already happened in one polling place.
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:04:57.439]  The power went out.
[02:04:57.739 --> 02:05:00.060]  Remember, I predicted that that would be the case.
[02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:02.739]  And, you know, my prediction came true.
[02:05:03.819 --> 02:05:08.760]  And there may be certainly very, very, very long lines.
[02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:12.840]  At the end of the day, they're going to say, sorry, you know, there just weren't enough staff.
[02:05:13.039 --> 02:05:14.140]  There weren't enough resources.
[02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:20.260]  I think that there is going to be...
[02:05:21.590 --> 02:05:23.130]  You know, claims and counterclaims.
[02:05:23.630 --> 02:05:29.649]  I think that the Harris camp is going to file a lot of lawsuits.
[02:05:29.869 --> 02:05:37.750]  They have hundreds of lawyers at the ready, and Trump also will file lawsuits for irregularities.
[02:05:37.909 --> 02:06:00.779]  I have been told by my co-host, Emerald Robinson, who's a very distinguished conservative reporter with a lot of contacts in the Trump campaign, That she is very worried and upset because the RNC and the Trump campaign had time to put hundreds of lawyers in place,
[02:06:01.159 --> 02:06:04.100]  had the resources and didn't put enough lawyers in place.
[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:25.840]  And again, remembering from, you know, 2000, there were dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of lawyers, the best lawyers positioned in advance in States around the country so that Gore 2000 could fight legally as soon as there were questions about the vote count.
[02:06:26.140 --> 02:06:33.359]  I don't know, I don't think from what Emerald Robinson has been reporting that's going to be an even match of lawyers.
[02:06:33.659 --> 02:06:41.119]  I think that the Democratic lawyers just have more manpower and womanpower than the Republican lawyers.
[02:06:42.260 --> 02:06:52.029]  That's not necessarily the end of the story because I'm guessing that the Republican lawyers will have more evidence and a better case to bring.
[02:06:52.250 --> 02:07:03.729]  In other words, I think there's going to be more cheating to silence or disable or erase Republican than Democratic votes, of course.
[02:07:03.949 --> 02:07:08.250]  But I think we're not going to know who won tomorrow.
[02:07:08.250 --> 02:07:17.399]  And I think it's going to be a—I hope I'm wrong— Unfortunately, my correctness in predicting these matters is about 90 to 95%.
[02:07:17.399 --> 02:07:28.560]  I think we're in for a miserable, horrific, messy few weeks, if not right through the inauguration, or what should be the inauguration.
[02:07:29.359 --> 02:07:35.819]  I think that Americans are going to be really at each other's throats, metaphorically, I hope, not literally.
[02:07:36.439 --> 02:07:59.060]  A lot of hatred and hostility and division As the claims and counterclaims emerge and the battle goes to the courts, I believe that Jamie Raskin is telling the truth when he warns or claims with a smug,
[02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:05.960]  satisfied smile that they just won't validate the vote.
[02:08:06.060 --> 02:08:09.140]  They just won't Confirm the vote.
[02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:24.680]  They'll find a loophole that even if President Trump wins, right, by a miracle of people turning out, making it too big to rig, scrutiny of the paper ballots, maybe even the machines doing what they're supposed to do,
[02:08:24.819 --> 02:08:26.300]  which I have no faith in, as you know.
[02:08:27.039 --> 02:08:40.819]  But if actually there's a Trump win, and right now he looks like he's up in many polls, One to three percentage points in most of the battleground states.
[02:08:41.039 --> 02:08:52.380]  But I really want to warn you that according to political consultants and their wisdom or their toolkit, the margin of error is 4%.
[02:08:52.380 --> 02:09:00.239]  So you really need to be above that 4% margin of error before you can be sure that you're winning, right?
[02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:02.579]  And for Trump, I'm going to say there's so much cheating.
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:06.319]  As I've said before, he really has to be up like 7% to 10%.
[02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:07.340]  To win.
[02:09:07.699 --> 02:09:09.079]  But say he wins.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:25.579]  I still believe that the Biden administration, the Harris administration, I should say, Harris, the Harris campaign is going to, in cahoots with the Biden administration, is going to deny him victory.
[02:09:26.380 --> 02:09:29.279]  They're not going to turn over the keys to the White House.
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:41.560]  They are going to, you know, as I said, find a loophole You know, he's a felon, or he's not in his right mind, or, you know, he called for violence.
[02:09:41.939 --> 02:09:44.420]  They're spinning it now that he's calling for violence.
[02:09:44.619 --> 02:09:53.399]  And honestly, you know, I said this to Alex when I was last on his show, on this show, I do wish President Trump would be more careful with his language.
[02:09:54.079 --> 02:10:04.279]  Because he did say in Pennsylvania, to get at me, you'd have to shoot through the fake media Which I don't mind.
[02:10:04.579 --> 02:10:21.020]  That can be spun as a threat, you know, just as, you know, when Alex and I were last speaking, I wasn't thrilled that he was imagining a scenario in which Liz Cheney gets shot in the face because the narrative,
[02:10:21.340 --> 02:10:28.920]  the goal of the Democrats is going to be to say, look, he's violent, he's a fascist.
[02:10:30.140 --> 02:10:30.680]  Yes.
[02:10:34.170 --> 02:10:38.430]  And they're going to use that to deny him.
[02:10:39.550 --> 02:10:43.310]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Chase Geyser, your host for the evening.
[02:10:43.470 --> 02:10:46.310]  We're going to go back to Naomi Wolf in just a minute or two.
[02:10:46.489 --> 02:10:55.130]  And I will be hosting Sunday Night Live as usual, starting at the top of the hour after we hear more from the esteemed, incredible, and impressive Naomi Wolf.
[02:10:55.289 --> 02:10:58.069]  But I wanted to come in now for this message.
[02:10:59.729 --> 02:11:00.210]  Because...
[02:11:01.819 --> 02:11:05.500]  There's nothing more important that I could possibly say to you than what I'm about ready to say.
[02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:09.159]  We have two days left until this historic election.
[02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:13.800]  It's absolutely 100% not hyperbolic to say that it's the most important election in the history of our country.
[02:11:14.279 --> 02:11:18.500]  And just like they stole the election in 2020, they're trying to steal the election in 2024.
[02:11:19.199 --> 02:11:29.119]  And just like they used the judicial system in a weaponized fashion against Donald Trump and against the election in 2020, and they're certainly going to do in 2024, they've used...
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:37.560]  The weaponization of the Department of Justice and our judicial system, our whole entire judicial branch against Alex Jones and Infowar specifically.
[02:11:37.779 --> 02:11:55.260]  And so for the sake of this crew and these hosts and free speech itself and humanity itself and the truth being able to be broadcast everywhere, I need you to go to thealexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP. Because that is absolutely key,
[02:11:55.539 --> 02:12:02.520]  absolutely essential to make sure that Alex Jones will always be on the air to make sure that this crew can always operate to get the truth out there.
[02:12:02.619 --> 02:12:07.359]  We have nine to 10 days, less than 10 days until InfoWars is auctioned.
[02:12:07.380 --> 02:12:10.180]  We don't know if a friendly buyer is going to buy it and everybody's going to be able to keep their jobs.
[02:12:10.319 --> 02:12:12.979]  We don't know if Soros is going to bid through Media Matters and take it.
[02:12:13.079 --> 02:12:14.880]  We do not know what's going to happen.
[02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:19.560]  We have people coming in the studio this week to crawl through the archives, download stuff to try to sell our intellectual property.
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:23.720]  It is the last lap over the course of the next 9 to 10 days.
[02:12:23.819 --> 02:12:39.460]  So if you've been a listener for two days, two weeks, or two decades, now is the time, if you never have, to go to thealexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP and sign up because that is how we can ensure that we can fund the next operation or this operation.
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:42.579]  If this operation stays operational, then great, fine.
[02:12:42.819 --> 02:12:44.619]  The VIP club is essential for that.
[02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:47.699]  But if this gets shut down in 9 to 10 days, and I honestly don't know what's going to happen.
[02:12:47.739 --> 02:12:48.800]  I'm thinking 50-50 here.
[02:12:49.659 --> 02:13:03.100]  Then that VIP club, the alexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP, is going to be essential to ensure that we can stay on the air the same day with the same crew broadcasting the same truth in defiance of the New World Order.
[02:13:03.850 --> 02:13:05.270]  And it's not a charity thing.
[02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:07.449]  I'm not asking you to do this just to help Alex Jones out or the crew.
[02:13:07.550 --> 02:13:08.649]  It's not even a selfish thing.
[02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:15.989]  It's only selfish to the extent that I want to save humanity from these globalists from the New World Order trying to conglomerate all political power into one world government.
[02:13:16.109 --> 02:13:19.029]  But you sign up for $30 a month, you get $40 in store credit.
[02:13:19.149 --> 02:13:25.449]  We have new shirts every single day the last couple weeks, it seems like, coming out at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:13:25.829 --> 02:13:27.050]  New supplements all the time.
[02:13:27.229 --> 02:13:28.390]  Amazing, high-quality products.
[02:13:28.529 --> 02:13:34.729]  I'm so proud and impressed by the Big League team and their crew and what they've done to help us save this operation and ensure that Alex will always be on there.
[02:13:34.810 --> 02:13:40.010]  So please, go to thealexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP right now and sign up.
[02:13:40.369 --> 02:13:41.689]  Naomi Wolf is going to be taking over.
[02:13:41.770 --> 02:13:43.369]  She's a globally recognized commentator.
[02:13:43.590 --> 02:13:43.970]  Dr.
[02:13:44.109 --> 02:13:51.369]  Wolf is the author of eight best-selling nonfiction books, including NYT Best Sellers, The End of America, and Give Me Liberty, the documentary...
[02:13:51.859 --> 02:13:54.380]  Of the end of America was downloaded 2 million times.
[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:57.359]  Her columns and TV appearances have been in every major news outlet in the West.
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:13:58.659]  She's a Rhodes Scholar.
[02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:00.760]  Oh, one thing she has in common with Bill Clinton.
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:04.260]  With a DPhil from Oxford, Dr.
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:08.739]  Wolf was an informal consultant for the Clinton re-election campaign and formally advised Gore2000.
[02:14:08.739 --> 02:14:12.880]  She is the first American woman whose portrait is hung at Rhodes House, Oxford University.
[02:14:13.020 --> 02:14:16.199]  She is co-founder and CEO of DailyCloud.io, a news...
[02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:30.569]  Thank you so much.
[02:14:31.170 --> 02:14:32.930]  First, let me say I'm so sorry.
[02:14:33.649 --> 02:14:38.489]  I knew that there were dramatic events around Infowars.
[02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:41.949]  I didn't realize what's going on in nine to ten days.
[02:14:42.189 --> 02:14:44.829]  I hope for a really good outcome for you.
[02:14:45.569 --> 02:14:47.789]  I'm just going to second what you just said.
[02:14:48.229 --> 02:15:02.109]  People, if you care about free speech and independent media, you've got to support Infowars and, you know, the handful of other outlets that are not bowing down to censorship in really serious times.
[02:15:02.350 --> 02:15:04.170]  So again, what an honor to be here.
[02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:10.270]  Well, in this segment, I want to make an appeal to undecideds.
[02:15:11.359 --> 02:15:13.920]  I may have said that voting starts tomorrow.
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:15.420]  It does here in New York State.
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:31.779]  I don't know where the polls open for you in your state, but we have a day or two days for a lot of millions of people, probably, who don't know yet what they're going to do when they get inside that booth or in that polling place.
[02:15:32.359 --> 02:15:34.899]  And I'm a lifelong liberal.
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:36.680]  I'm a lifelong Democrat.
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:44.010]  As you heard from my bio, I advised Clinton's re-election campaign in Gore 2000.
[02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:47.489]  I was married to a White House speechwriter for the Clintons.
[02:15:48.909 --> 02:15:51.470]  And, you know, I was a fixture on the left.
[02:15:51.850 --> 02:15:57.789]  And I came out formally and endorsed President Trump about five days ago.
[02:15:58.029 --> 02:16:08.270]  It was actually just before Steve Bannon's press conference on the day that he was released from prison where he had been sent, federal prison in Danbury, for a misdemeanor.
[02:16:08.270 --> 02:16:15.449]  And as he pointed out, He's the only person who, to his knowledge, has been in that prison for a misdemeanor.
[02:16:15.630 --> 02:16:20.989]  That's the kind of weaponization of the justice system that we've seen under Biden-Harris.
[02:16:21.310 --> 02:16:32.709]  And so I wrote a little bit about why I endorsed Donald Trump after being a lifelong, like lifelong Democrat from a long line of Democrats.
[02:16:33.409 --> 02:16:37.170]  Never in a million years thought I would endorse President Trump.
[02:16:37.569 --> 02:16:52.030]  But we've got two days and so I want to give any undecideds, any independents, any even liberals out there what my reasons are and why I believe that you can safely vote for President Trump.
[02:16:53.209 --> 02:16:59.309]  So first I want to remind everyone what a vice president is for, okay?
[02:17:00.030 --> 02:17:12.569]  And it's amazing to me, you know, that Kamala Harris has managed and legacy media have managed again to get us to forget what the job of a vice president is.
[02:17:13.010 --> 02:17:27.139]  Kamala Harris has frequently in her campaign distanced herself from some of the worst decisions and most negative Actions of the Biden regime.
[02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:38.180]  She, you know, acts like she wasn't even in the room during the horrific Afghanistan rollout, which traumatized my veteran husband to even witness.
[02:17:38.459 --> 02:17:50.000]  It made him feel like, what's the point of his having risked his life for years to serve his country if that's what they're going to do to our allies and helpers in Afghanistan?
[02:17:50.659 --> 02:18:00.520]  Who risked their lives to help the United States, let alone to our soldiers, the men and women who died or were injured or disabled fighting in Afghanistan.
[02:18:01.620 --> 02:18:09.239]  She pretended that she doesn't agree with some of the actions of the Biden administration.
[02:18:10.020 --> 02:18:21.420]  Well, the first thing I want to say to you is, and I kind of feel like of all the people in the world who could Attest to this, you know, I am one of them.
[02:18:21.639 --> 02:18:31.319]  I advised a Gore when he was a sitting vice president who was running for the presidency, which is exactly Harris's situation right now.
[02:18:31.739 --> 02:18:38.459]  And I can tell you, there is no such thing as deniability for a vice president.
[02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:40.239]  It doesn't exist.
[02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:41.899]  Why do I say that?
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:46.219]  Because the vice president has a voice, right?
[02:18:46.530 --> 02:18:49.469]  The vice president is part of the decision-making process.
[02:18:49.829 --> 02:18:52.750]  It's not like, oh, Biden's over there.
[02:18:53.090 --> 02:18:54.370]  Kamala Harris is over there.
[02:18:54.510 --> 02:18:56.069]  They really have nothing to do with each other.
[02:18:56.190 --> 02:18:57.569]  Their offices don't communicate.
[02:18:57.870 --> 02:18:58.290]  No.
[02:18:58.690 --> 02:19:08.790]  All day, every day, the chief of staff and the staff of the president is communicating with the chief of staff and the staff of the vice president and vice versa.
[02:19:09.049 --> 02:19:24.700]  The vice president's office sees and signs off on or has input into Every major speech, every major policy decision, every major foreign policy decision, every major national security decision.
[02:19:24.879 --> 02:19:27.899]  They see the intelligence briefings, right?
[02:19:28.219 --> 02:19:30.440]  They see the speeches.
[02:19:30.719 --> 02:19:32.579]  They sign off on the speeches.
[02:19:32.799 --> 02:19:49.309]  If there's something that Kamala Harris didn't agree with, If she didn't agree with the withdrawal from Afghanistan, if she didn't agree with the unconstitutional mandates that I knew would be found unconstitutional,
[02:19:49.510 --> 02:20:03.049]  forcing people to take an experimental injection, now a major multi-million dollar win for BART, California transportation workers, Against the mandate has been decided.
[02:20:03.290 --> 02:20:04.610]  That day was inevitable.
[02:20:05.170 --> 02:20:06.309]  She went along with it, right?
[02:20:06.569 --> 02:20:24.569]  If she didn't go along with horrific decisions, if she didn't go along with rolling out this injection that sterilized and killed people, if she didn't go along with the unconstitutional limiting of our freedom of assembly during COVID,
[02:20:24.889 --> 02:20:25.030]  right?
[02:20:25.290 --> 02:20:27.350]  All she had to do was resign.
[02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:31.600]  But there is no way she wasn't part of the decision-making process.
[02:20:31.799 --> 02:20:32.979]  That just doesn't happen.
[02:20:33.219 --> 02:20:34.579]  But she didn't resign.
[02:20:34.780 --> 02:20:35.780]  She didn't resign.
[02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:38.420]  And she had evidence of all of these crimes.
[02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:44.959]  You know, the Pfizer Papers, which is our book that just came out, documents that POTUS knew, Dr.
[02:20:45.059 --> 02:20:45.840]  Fauci knew, Dr.
[02:20:45.920 --> 02:21:01.090]  Walensky knew, and the Vice President knew all the evidence of injuries, babies dying in utero, damage to women's menstrual cycles, damage to the hearts of minors, Lethal damage, pericarditis, myocarditis,
[02:21:01.469 --> 02:21:05.750]  the thousands of serious adverse events, she knew.
[02:21:05.969 --> 02:21:13.229]  She didn't resign, and all she had to do was resign and give a press conference if she wasn't on board with any of it.
[02:21:13.370 --> 02:21:14.270]  She didn't do that.
[02:21:14.409 --> 02:21:32.129]  So I'm just here to tell you there's no such thing as a vice president who is not in the room during these critical decisions who doesn't know what's going on, isn't read in, doesn't have a voice about Positive and negative things that the president is doing,
[02:21:32.250 --> 02:21:33.309]  she does.
[02:21:33.309 --> 02:21:34.229]  She was there.
[02:21:34.450 --> 02:21:35.430]  She has a voice.
[02:21:35.569 --> 02:21:37.889]  And if she wasn't on board with it, she could have resigned.
[02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:40.850]  I just want to say that, number one.
[02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:45.790]  Number two, what is a vice president for?
[02:21:47.870 --> 02:22:05.520]  By far the most serious thing, even more than not speaking up or resigning for all of this damage that was inflicted on the American people during the Biden regime, The main thing you've got to understand is that she failed at her only job.
[02:22:05.659 --> 02:22:07.600]  And let me explain to you what I mean by that.
[02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:11.059]  And this is another example of like, they're hoping we don't remember civics.
[02:22:11.639 --> 02:22:13.399]  Why is there a vice president?
[02:22:13.540 --> 02:22:15.020]  Why do we have that system?
[02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:17.819]  Why do we have a president and a vice president?
[02:22:18.639 --> 02:22:24.420]  I'm just reminding you, and forgive me those of you who took civics, you know this, but I have to restate it.
[02:22:25.340 --> 02:22:31.239]  It's not to get You know, the white male Southern vote, if you've got a white male Southern Vice President.
[02:22:31.500 --> 02:22:36.739]  It's not to have, you know, a decorative first female Vice President, right?
[02:22:36.979 --> 02:22:51.219]  It's not window dressing like, you know, pardoning the Thanksgiving turkey at the White House, or the White House egg roll, Easter egg roll hunt, or, you know, the Christmas tree.
[02:22:51.639 --> 02:22:53.579]  It's not symbolic.
[02:22:53.979 --> 02:23:01.959]  The only reason We have a vice president is in case the president dies or becomes impaired.
[02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:05.139]  That's why we have a vice president.
[02:23:05.319 --> 02:23:06.799]  That is the only reason.
[02:23:07.059 --> 02:23:10.680]  And that's why only America has a vice president, right?
[02:23:10.819 --> 02:23:23.780]  They don't have the same kind of succession backup structure in other countries that don't have our tripartite system of government, the executive, the judicial, and the legislative.
[02:23:24.159 --> 02:23:40.180]  So her only job, her only main reason to be in or around the White House is to step in if the president dies, like Lyndon Johnson did when JFK was assassinated.
[02:23:40.959 --> 02:23:43.319]  That's our org chart, right?
[02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:48.579]  The president dies, vice president becomes president until there's an election, and then there's an election.
[02:23:48.819 --> 02:23:53.680]  But also, in case the president becomes impaired.
[02:23:55.270 --> 02:24:17.069]  That's when the vice president's job is to say the president is impaired, we have to have an independent review of the president's impairment, and that's when the vice president initiates stepping in so that the country will be spared the damage of an impaired president.
[02:24:17.229 --> 02:24:19.389]  That's her only job, okay?
[02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:20.629]  That's her job.
[02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:43.079]  I talked to, I interviewed doctors who specialize in Parkinson's and they both independently said that the symptoms of Parkinson's disease were evident, apparent, obvious in late 2020 and certainly in early 2021 for President Biden.
[02:24:43.299 --> 02:24:46.520]  And my dad had Parkinson's, it's a terrible disease.
[02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:50.870]  It's not a disease where it gets worse and then it gets better.
[02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:53.950]  It's a disease that only deteriorates over time.
[02:24:54.110 --> 02:24:55.510]  You can have some good days.
[02:24:55.850 --> 02:25:12.510]  You can have some days where a patient with Parkinson's, like my dad, you could have given him at one point when he was quite far gone, a script and turned on a camera for five minutes and cut and edited how he managed that script.
[02:25:12.649 --> 02:25:18.200]  And you could have something that looked like a lucid Leonard Wolfe, right?
[02:25:18.379 --> 02:25:20.500]  But that would have been very deceptive.
[02:25:20.780 --> 02:25:26.100]  And people with Parkinson's are not in a position to run a country.
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:27.940]  Now, I'm not a medical doctor.
[02:25:28.180 --> 02:25:30.379]  These are the opinions of two independent doctors.
[02:25:30.559 --> 02:25:35.379]  But whether or not President Biden has Parkinson's, he clearly has dementia.
[02:25:35.620 --> 02:25:42.540]  And all of us who were observant noted dementia early to mid-2021.
[02:25:43.020 --> 02:25:47.100]  So You've got to process what that means.
[02:25:47.540 --> 02:26:00.899]  That the one person whose job is to have the president step aside and resign or be Article 25, I think it's called, when that president is impaired, didn't do it.
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:05.700]  It's not Nancy Pelosi's job to get the president to step aside.
[02:26:05.879 --> 02:26:10.420]  It's not Congress's job to get the president to step aside.
[02:26:10.799 --> 02:26:15.219]  It's not the Chief of Staff's job to get the President to step aside when the President is impaired.
[02:26:15.579 --> 02:26:23.180]  The job belongs to the Vice President to step in and run the country when the President is impaired.
[02:26:23.399 --> 02:26:33.680]  And no one works as closely, maybe the Chief of Staff in the White House, but no one works as closely apart from that with the President than does the Vice President.
[02:26:33.969 --> 02:26:40.649]  So she was in a position to see it and know it, and it was her job to step in when that president was impaired.
[02:26:40.809 --> 02:26:41.750]  So she didn't.
[02:26:42.069 --> 02:26:45.870]  So I want you to think about, she concealed it, right?
[02:26:46.069 --> 02:26:47.729]  She concealed it for two years.
[02:26:48.049 --> 02:26:50.590]  I want you to think about what that really means.
[02:26:51.010 --> 02:26:53.909]  We weren't the only ones who noticed that our president was impaired.
[02:26:54.329 --> 02:27:00.409]  Our enemies certainly noticed, and they read it correctly as our weakness.
[02:27:00.709 --> 02:27:07.090]  It is, to this day, a massive national security risk, right, vulnerability.
[02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:18.729]  President Biden's impairment is why, you know, hundreds of people were taken hostage in Israel and then Gaza was flattened, right?
[02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:26.450]  There's no one to step in there and calm The crisis in the Middle East.
[02:27:26.649 --> 02:27:36.370]  President Biden's impairment is why the border is open and people are flowing in, changing the nature of our country itself and escalating crime.
[02:27:36.549 --> 02:27:46.329]  President Biden's impairment is why our allies, like Saudi Arabia, are aligning with China and Russia instead of with us.
[02:27:46.469 --> 02:27:49.729]  There's no one running the United States of America.
[02:27:49.969 --> 02:27:53.209]  Who's running the United States of America right now, right?
[02:27:53.389 --> 02:27:56.090]  The president still hasn't stepped aside.
[02:27:56.389 --> 02:28:13.610]  What is supposed to happen in our line of succession is the demented president is forced to resign, and whether you like her or not, Kamala Harris was supposed to be president of the United States starting in mid-2021 when President Biden's dementia became undeniable.
[02:28:13.649 --> 02:28:15.090]  That didn't happen.
[02:28:20.180 --> 02:28:23.879]  Exposing us to this national security disaster.
[02:28:24.239 --> 02:28:27.459]  It's Kamala Harris because it's her job to step in.
[02:28:27.879 --> 02:28:32.159]  All right, so this is not just her failing at her only job.
[02:28:32.459 --> 02:28:33.739]  It's also treason.
[02:28:33.959 --> 02:28:36.059]  And I'm not threatening anything.
[02:28:36.399 --> 02:28:38.000]  I'm a nonviolent person.
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:41.360]  It's just the fact that treason is a capital offense.
[02:28:42.059 --> 02:28:51.649]  That's one thing I want to say when, if you're undecided or unsure whom to vote for, That's the lens you should use in looking at Kamala Harris.
[02:28:52.170 --> 02:29:04.969]  She abandoned her only job and she endangered our entire country and the rest of the world because everyone suffers when the United States is wounded, which we are, through Biden's dementia.
[02:29:05.909 --> 02:29:21.899]  Another few things I want to say as a liberal, I still consider myself a classical liberal, are that I believe that you can vote for President Trump Because of a few things that I think you can be able to lay to rest as worries.
[02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:30.459]  Liberals like me, and especially feminist liberals as I am, tend to be like single or two-issue voters.
[02:29:30.719 --> 02:29:39.319]  In other words, we'll put up with the worst candidates in the world as long as they protect abortion rights and Address climate change.
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:50.719]  Because we genuinely believe, and I know I'm not speaking to an audience that necessarily has a lot of patience for this, but I'm just sharing, you know, we genuinely believe that without abortion rights, without Roe v.
[02:29:50.799 --> 02:30:00.340]  Wade, women will become second-class citizens and, you know, serfs in a patriarchal, misogynist kind of theocracy.
[02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:08.649]  And we also truly believe that the climate won't survive if people are not serious about Tackling climate change.
[02:30:09.309 --> 02:30:15.870]  So I just want to tell undecideds, this is the way it's going to be.
[02:30:16.030 --> 02:30:18.250]  You're not going to lose Roe v.
[02:30:18.309 --> 02:30:18.469]  Wade.
[02:30:18.549 --> 02:30:23.670]  You're not going to lose abortion rights, in my considered opinion, because you've already lost Roe v.
[02:30:23.909 --> 02:30:23.930]  Wade.
[02:30:24.110 --> 02:30:25.770]  In other words, it's gone, right?
[02:30:26.290 --> 02:30:27.670]  It got overturned.
[02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:30.729]  Now, I would say I'm a pro-choice feminist.
[02:30:30.989 --> 02:30:32.290]  I struggle with it.
[02:30:32.389 --> 02:30:35.969]  I know it's not ideal, but I'm like most Americans.
[02:30:35.969 --> 02:30:42.010]  I want limited access to abortion with lots of restrictions, but I don't want no abortion.
[02:30:42.290 --> 02:30:46.350]  And I also don't want what the insane Democrats are pushing for.
[02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:53.350]  And I've seen the legislation, you know, abortion up through the eighth month or even bills I've read that exist.
[02:30:53.959 --> 02:30:57.920]  That let you neglect a child to death a month after the child is born.
[02:30:58.600 --> 02:31:01.739]  Most Americans want, you know, kind of a moderate middle way.
[02:31:01.979 --> 02:31:04.739]  Well, we've lost Roe v.
[02:31:04.959 --> 02:31:05.399]  Wade, okay?
[02:31:05.600 --> 02:31:06.139]  It's in the past.
[02:31:06.260 --> 02:31:10.940]  This is actually a gift to Republicans, but Democrats and liberals and independents need to understand this too.
[02:31:11.319 --> 02:31:14.540]  In America, it is not the case that post-Roe v.
[02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:17.079]  Wade you can't get an abortion under any circumstances.
[02:31:17.979 --> 02:31:20.030]  If you Still believe in abortion.
[02:31:20.229 --> 02:31:20.989]  You still want an abortion.
[02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:22.889]  You can get an abortion in America.
[02:31:23.790 --> 02:31:24.809]  You have to travel.
[02:31:24.989 --> 02:31:25.950]  You may have to travel.
[02:31:26.209 --> 02:31:33.049]  And I just feel like as serious as a decision it is to have an abortion, that's not an undue burden.
[02:31:33.989 --> 02:31:38.569]  Also, I believe that it's right that the decision went back to the states.
[02:31:38.750 --> 02:31:43.229]  I don't think it was right to have a federal decision about it through the Supreme Court.
[02:31:43.809 --> 02:31:47.629]  And in the states, women are the majority of voters in every state.
[02:31:48.059 --> 02:31:54.520]  So if the women of Massachusetts want to change the law to, you know, make abortion more accessible, they can do that.
[02:31:54.700 --> 02:32:00.799]  If the women of Alabama want to change the law to make abortion less accessible or more of a pro-life state, they can do that.
[02:32:01.280 --> 02:32:06.719]  And I really think you've got to recognize that the Democrats, that's their last card.
[02:32:06.860 --> 02:32:09.760]  And they're saying, you'll lose abortion rights.
[02:32:09.899 --> 02:32:10.420]  Well, Roe v.
[02:32:10.540 --> 02:32:16.420]  Wade went away and you didn't Lose the ability to still terminate a pregnancy in the United States of America.
[02:32:16.719 --> 02:32:22.540]  I know a lot of people in this audience may not think that's a good thing, and we can continue to have those fights peacefully.
[02:32:23.079 --> 02:32:28.639]  But to liberals and independents, I really think you should lay to rest that canard.
[02:32:28.899 --> 02:32:35.040]  And also, President Trump has signaled that he's going to take a moderate path on that issue.
[02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:42.270]  Having Melania say that she's pro-choice is exactly what George Bush Jr.
[02:32:42.510 --> 02:32:45.489]  did in sending his wife out to say that she was pro-choice.
[02:32:45.629 --> 02:33:00.750]  It's a way to signal to the base, you know, I'm still going to try to respect a pro-life position, not be insane in kind of propagating abortion on demand,
[02:33:00.770 --> 02:33:04.270]  but also signaling a moderate approach to the issue.
[02:33:05.809 --> 02:33:07.329]  Climate change, all right?
[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:12.379]  As I mentioned, liberals are insanely attached to climate change.
[02:33:12.520 --> 02:33:24.799]  Arguably, it's not unreasonable if you really believe the world will end, if the president doesn't tackle climate change, you will accept any lunatic and monster as long as they deal with climate change.
[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.659]  Because there won't be a future, otherwise you truly believe.
[02:33:27.899 --> 02:33:38.780]  Now, whether or not you think climate change is real or a hoax, It has been off-putting, to say the least, to liberals and independents that President Trump has referred to it as a hoax.
[02:33:38.819 --> 02:33:40.760]  That sounds not well informed.
[02:33:40.959 --> 02:33:45.620]  So I'm incredibly happy that RFK Jr.
[02:33:46.100 --> 02:33:50.440]  and his world has joined forces with President Trump.
[02:33:50.719 --> 02:33:51.399]  RFK Jr.
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:53.059]  is a great environmentalist.
[02:33:53.180 --> 02:33:55.159]  He saved the Hudson River.
[02:33:55.399 --> 02:34:00.059]  He turned it from a dead river to one where you can fish and swim.
[02:34:00.659 --> 02:34:19.920]  He understands climate issues, but he also understands other ways to have a conservative version of an environmental policy, whether it's making cities more walkable, which everyone wants, it's nonpartisan, or making agriculture more sustainable,
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:29.959]  helping farmers have more organic crops, whether it's having a mix of fossil fuels and alternative fuels.
[02:34:30.850 --> 02:34:35.450]  He knows the right people to have a sane environmental policy.
[02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:44.610]  And I'm glad to see that President Trump, while he doesn't, you know, embrace climate change as an issue, is talking about clean air and clean water.
[02:34:45.469 --> 02:34:47.649]  So those are the points I want to make.
[02:34:47.850 --> 02:34:53.110]  And lastly, I think President Trump is really signaling that he's not going to have a theocracy.
[02:34:53.309 --> 02:34:57.409]  He's talking about unity, people of all races, creeds, religions.
[02:34:57.690 --> 02:34:59.530]  That's a really welcome change.
[02:34:59.729 --> 02:35:01.889]  He's being more inclusive in his language.
[02:35:02.069 --> 02:35:13.920]  And so all those are the reasons I think you should put While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:35:14.379 --> 02:35:16.600]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:19.879]  They're coming after everybody.
[02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:20.819]  They're coming after Trump.
[02:35:20.940 --> 02:35:21.680]  They're coming after Kennedy.
[02:35:21.940 --> 02:35:22.780]  We need your support.
[02:35:22.879 --> 02:35:23.799]  And you don't even come here and do this.
[02:35:24.020 --> 02:35:25.260]  Alex, first of all, I want to thank you.
[02:35:25.319 --> 02:35:26.280]  Give to Alex Jones.
[02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:31.680]  I don't want this guy to have to be like wearing a symbol and we're all going to say, you know, the truth teller formerly known as Alex Jones.
[02:35:31.799 --> 02:35:32.959]  Let's not let that happen.
[02:35:33.239 --> 02:35:34.700]  Well, they're trying to make an example out of me.
[02:35:35.159 --> 02:35:37.719]  I'm not that important, but I've become a rallying point.
[02:35:37.860 --> 02:35:40.040]  I've become like a Roman standard they want to capture.
[02:35:40.239 --> 02:35:40.719]  Explain that.
[02:35:40.860 --> 02:35:41.079]  You're...
[02:35:41.290 --> 02:35:50.149]  Look, I mean, if we don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the First Amendment, if, you know, media, which is, look, it never said only newspapers or the media.
[02:35:50.149 --> 02:35:59.190]  It was anyone that wants to challenge government, anyone that's willing to put the feet to the fire of corporate interests of your government, that is supposed to be free.
[02:35:59.329 --> 02:36:00.329]  Electronic soapbox.
[02:36:00.579 --> 02:36:04.559]  In the end, if you lose, Alex, we all lose.
[02:36:04.680 --> 02:36:10.559]  We will all lose the ability to do tough stories, to take risks, to plant flags where we think there's an issue.
[02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:11.799]  Sometime we'll get it wrong.
[02:36:11.959 --> 02:36:13.879]  I said before, you do a daily show.
[02:36:13.979 --> 02:36:15.760]  It's impossible to nail that to the wall.
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:16.799]  I do a weekly show.
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:18.340]  I spend more time vetting it.
[02:36:18.420 --> 02:36:19.340]  They're two different animals.
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:20.520]  They can't be compared to each other.
[02:36:20.520 --> 02:36:21.840]  They also take stuff out of context.
[02:36:22.479 --> 02:36:23.840]  Absolutely, that's true.
[02:36:23.979 --> 02:36:32.500]  You know, one of the things that makes you so spectacular, Alex, is long before any of us were here, You were starting to talk about this deep state.
[02:36:32.700 --> 02:36:44.079]  You were talking about this, you know, a government that was supposed to be of, for and by the people that was being robbed from us by corporate interests, by special interests, by globalists, long before anybody else ever did.
[02:36:44.639 --> 02:36:49.600]  And to imagine you sitting here in this moment, we are in that impactful moment.
[02:36:49.719 --> 02:36:51.879]  And in many ways, not enough people are listening to you.
[02:36:52.059 --> 02:37:07.399]  And I want to say that, you know, I think the vaccine, and we've talked about this before, that was the tip of the spear of the final death blow, which was if we can inject you and own your bodies and own the bodies of your children and pass laws that say that, you know, because of vaccinations,
[02:37:07.399 --> 02:37:09.459]  we've decided that we own your children.
[02:37:09.639 --> 02:37:10.479]  We make a decision.
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:11.920]  That's a revolutionary takeover.
[02:37:11.940 --> 02:37:16.059]  It was a revolutionary takeover, and so people like me got alarmed by that.
[02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:20.680]  And we joined forces with people like you that have been really talking about it for a long time.
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:23.739]  But I would say that we're at the very last stage.
[02:37:23.819 --> 02:37:28.819]  I was just speaking publicly, and this woman said, if things don't happen that fast, Dale, you're being really dramatic.
[02:37:28.819 --> 02:37:31.180]  I don't think this election matters that much.
[02:37:31.399 --> 02:37:35.739]  I was like, that's because you're looking at this over the last year, maybe two years.
[02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:58.209]  There's people like Bobby that's been fighting the corporate establishment for We're really at the end stage of a takeover and destruction of the one thing that stands in the way of globalist thinking,
[02:37:58.430 --> 02:38:01.129]  which is the Constitution of the United States of America.
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:03.420]  They're doing all these lawsuits trying to take my name.
[02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:04.239]  People say they can't do that.
[02:38:04.340 --> 02:38:05.239]  Well, I got to defend those.
[02:38:05.379 --> 02:38:06.040]  We're going to win.
[02:38:06.159 --> 02:38:06.639]  We're already winning.
[02:38:06.739 --> 02:38:07.819]  The judge shut them down last week.
[02:38:07.959 --> 02:38:11.799]  That took high-powered lawyers and that, you know, 50 grand right there to have those briefs ready, okay?
[02:38:11.879 --> 02:38:13.100]  This is total war.
[02:38:13.299 --> 02:38:14.120]  We make it easy.
[02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:16.319]  Great supplements, great t-shirts, great everything.

[02:38:51.309 --> 02:38:53.280]  First step starts This week, and the enemy already knows.
[02:38:54.139 --> 02:38:56.079]  But I need money to do it.
[02:38:56.120 --> 02:38:58.120]  I don't even think about my life or any of that.
[02:38:58.180 --> 02:38:58.700]  That doesn't matter.
[02:38:58.760 --> 02:38:59.420]  I'm on this mission.
[02:38:59.479 --> 02:38:59.979]  I love it.

[02:39:16.620 --> 02:39:18.379]  But at least we're in the fight, and we're starting to win.
