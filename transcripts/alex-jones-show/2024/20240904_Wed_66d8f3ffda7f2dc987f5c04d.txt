[00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:22.268]  Marxism.
[00:00:22.568 --> 00:00:31.137]  Some of us are well-schooled on what has become known as cultural Marxism, and many of our fellow American citizens are not, and I can't blame them.
[00:00:31.338 --> 00:00:37.684]  Marxist theory is a giant mess of complicated mental illness, but I'm sure you need more information than that.
[00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:42.810]  So what if I simply told you that following World War II, a group of Marxist political theorists
[00:00:42.950 --> 00:01:02.201]  Who seemed harmless after having fled persecution in Nazi Europe after betting on the wrong totalitarian horse, communism, brought their complete disgust for Western culture to Columbia University in New York City, and gradually spread their cancer into the government, media, and academic institutions of the United States.
[00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:21.174]  Notably, flaring up in the 1960s, as Dr. Theodore Dalrymple put it, these new theories appealed to utopian adolescents who, number one, wanted to deny that they were the most fortunate generation that had ever lived, and number two, dreamed of a life completely without restraints on their pleasure.
[00:01:21.494 --> 00:01:26.518]  Giving the baby boomers what they wanted and not what they needed, Frankfurt School adherent
[00:01:26.658 --> 00:01:50.389]  Former member of the Brain Trust of the OSS American War Machine and godfather of the New Left, Herbert Marcuse, along with his contemporaries, engineered a slow-moving Marxist revolution from within American society, utilizing a mass psychoanalytic Hegelian dialectic psyop that is blossoming today amongst the lethargic minds of the millennial generation.
[00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:54.491]  My friends at the Frankfurt School considered psychology
[00:01:55.812 --> 00:02:08.245]  One of the main branches of knowledge that had to be integrated with Marxian theory, by no means replacing Marxian theory.
[00:02:10.106 --> 00:02:11.607]  Taking it into monks.
[00:02:12.187 --> 00:02:16.129]  A synthesizing technique known as repressive tolerance.
[00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:21.711]  Thankfully, in the interest of time, Marcuse simplified the definition of repressive tolerance, saying,
[00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:52.070]  Repressive tolerance is achieved by arming the thoughts of emotional, rationally vacant liberals with the potent weapon of critical theory, a hive mentality that produces a catharsis for the self-loathing types of our society when confronting the social, historical, and ideological forces gluing the structures of a society together.
[00:03:00.015 --> 00:03:02.096]  People love you and you win.
[00:03:02.496 --> 00:03:05.318]  And when your son looks at you and says, mama, look, you won.
[00:03:05.838 --> 00:03:06.819]  Bullies don't win.
[00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.580]  And I said, baby, they don't because we're going to go in there.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.541]  We're going to impeach the mother.
[00:03:11.343 --> 00:03:20.890]  Judicial Watch has been sounding that alarm for some time now, exposing the fact that your tax dollars are supporting your own demise.
[00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:33.180]  George Soros' Open Society Foundation's efforts to subvert the populism and anti-globalism sweeping the United States with Marxist division and unyielding self-loathing
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.600]  I'm good.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.023]  Fomenting racial disharmony by funding anti-capitalist racialist organizations.
[00:03:56.203 --> 00:04:02.327]  Financing the Black Lives Matter movement and other organizations involved in the riots in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:04:02.487 --> 00:04:06.069]  Weakening the integrity of our electoral systems.
[00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.311]  Promoting taxpayer-funded abortion on demand.
[00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:12.113]  Advocating a government-run health care system.
[00:04:12.313 --> 00:04:25.802]  Opposing US counterterrorism efforts, promoting dubious transnational climate change agreements that threaten American sovereignty, and working to advance gun control and erode Second Amendment protections.
[00:04:26.123 --> 00:04:30.365]  And they essentially outsource our foreign policy to Soros front groups.
[00:04:31.446 --> 00:04:33.347]  Now as I said, George Soros is a billionaire.
[00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:36.730]  His groups
[00:04:38.763 --> 00:04:43.687]  Don't need tax dollars to do their work advancing their left-wing agenda, don't you think?
[00:04:44.127 --> 00:04:49.050]  The moral and rational code of the United States is taking a severe beating.
[00:04:49.230 --> 00:05:05.642]  We have no other choice but to prosecute and reject this invasion of intended mental illness spearheaded by enemies of our Republic like George Soros, or find ourselves morphing into the madness as our nation enters the point of no return.
[00:05:05.942 --> 00:05:08.184]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.
[00:05:28.071 --> 00:05:28.831]  InfoWars.
[00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:30.072]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:30.692]  Today.
[00:05:32.824 --> 00:05:34.065]  Woo!
[00:05:34.165 --> 00:05:37.588]  We got a transmission for you lined up today.
[00:05:37.688 --> 00:05:41.151]  It's Wednesday, September 4th, 2024.
[00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:48.938]  And I'm coming to you to the worldwide audience who loves freedom and who want to fight tyranny.
[00:05:49.318 --> 00:05:56.404]  And we are coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide on the September 4th, 2024 Wednesday transmission.
[00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:09.643]  Only 61 days, 14 hours, 52 minutes, 57 seconds left to the most important election in world history.
[00:06:10.183 --> 00:06:14.964]  You can cut the suspense in the air with a knife, my friends.
[00:06:16.905 --> 00:06:20.666]  All right, first big story we've got for you right now.
[00:06:20.706 --> 00:06:26.247]  We're gonna put it on screen for all those folks watching on TV stations, cable stations, and on the Mighty X.
[00:06:27.742 --> 00:06:36.289]  Cut real Alex Jones as well as Band.Video and Infowars.com forward slash show for the feeds, the free feeds of not just my show but the other great InfoWars shows.
[00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:38.291]  There it is!
[00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:41.353]  Jack Posobiec just posted it on X. I've reposted it.
[00:06:41.393 --> 00:06:49.540]  Real Alex Jones breaking Tim Walz's entire family endorses President Trump.
[00:06:50.558 --> 00:07:05.688]  The entire family of Tim Walz, the corrupt communist Chinese agent, Tampon Tim, his entire family have endorsed Trump and are set to now do interviews all over the place, probably even here.
[00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:08.610]  The people are with Trump.
[00:07:09.895 --> 00:07:13.497]  America is explosively waking up right now.
[00:07:14.398 --> 00:07:19.481]  Even in liberal neighborhoods, I'm seeing all these Trump signs.
[00:07:19.621 --> 00:07:21.442]  It is so exciting.
[00:07:21.622 --> 00:07:33.309]  And down the street from me, there is, they've been there for years, there's a gay couple of successful businessmen, and they've got a Trump flag in their yard.
[00:07:34.724 --> 00:07:40.445]  I've seen him walking their dog many times, and I'm gonna strike up a conversation next time I see him.
[00:07:40.465 --> 00:07:42.025]  I don't really ever talk to the neighbors much.
[00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:46.966]  They're about five doors down, but next time I see him walking the dog, I'm gonna say, hey, what's up with the Trump flag?
[00:07:47.026 --> 00:07:50.647]  So, I mean, it's just amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:50.687 --> 00:07:51.627]  People want prosperity.
[00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:52.307]  They want freedom.
[00:07:53.267 --> 00:07:55.648]  And it's really a transcendence we're seeing.
[00:07:55.788 --> 00:07:56.628]  Look at this photo.
[00:07:56.968 --> 00:07:58.208]  Let's just put that on screen.
[00:07:59.409 --> 00:08:01.549]  Let's blow it up full size and look at that family.
[00:08:02.745 --> 00:08:03.145]  Look at that.
[00:08:03.205 --> 00:08:06.306]  His brothers, his sisters, his nephews, his nieces.
[00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:11.068]  All saying he is a dangerous con man.
[00:08:11.788 --> 00:08:14.449]  That he shouldn't be in charge of anything.
[00:08:15.649 --> 00:08:19.290]  He's a congenital liar.
[00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.731]  He is a pathological liar.
[00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:24.332]  Look at that.
[00:08:24.492 --> 00:08:25.272]  Nebraska.
[00:08:26.912 --> 00:08:27.913]  Walls for Trump.
[00:08:29.593 --> 00:08:31.454]  That's where they're from is Nebraska.
[00:08:32.717 --> 00:08:34.178]  And there they are.
[00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:40.901]  Producers, you don't need me to tell you, but Little Birdz told me that they're set to do interviews.
[00:08:41.522 --> 00:08:43.423]  Also, his brother in Florida is.
[00:08:44.303 --> 00:08:44.723]  Get them!
[00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:45.724]  Get them!
[00:08:46.304 --> 00:08:46.704]  Get them!
[00:08:47.305 --> 00:08:47.705]  Get them!
[00:08:48.285 --> 00:08:48.685]  Get them!
[00:08:49.226 --> 00:08:49.606]  Get them!
[00:08:50.226 --> 00:08:51.227]  Get them now!
[00:08:52.187 --> 00:08:52.968]  Woohoo!
[00:08:53.108 --> 00:08:55.109]  Yeah!
[00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:00.752]  So there's one dirty commie in the family, a Chinese communist agent, Tampon Tim.
[00:09:03.885 --> 00:09:04.826]  Lies about everything.
[00:09:04.866 --> 00:09:06.186]  Lies about stolen valor.
[00:09:07.007 --> 00:09:10.369]  Lies about giving the Chamber of Commerce higher award, never got an award.
[00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.230]  Lies about his college.
[00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.632]  Lies about everything.
[00:09:16.232 --> 00:09:17.813]  Lies about in vitro fertilization.
[00:09:17.833 --> 00:09:22.656]  Just lies, lies, lies, lies, lies.
[00:09:22.736 --> 00:09:24.417]  I forget the name of the ministry song.
[00:09:24.477 --> 00:09:25.137]  Is it lies?
[00:09:26.378 --> 00:09:27.699]  Maybe just find the song.
[00:09:27.719 --> 00:09:30.560]  Just type in what ministry song has the chant lies.
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.281]  I think it's lies.
[00:09:32.976 --> 00:09:39.822]  Maybe just for Tim Walz, we should play this for him.
[00:09:41.444 --> 00:09:43.126]  It is called Lies, Lies, Lies.
[00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:43.766]  Are you ready with it?
[00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:47.690]  I know it's in the computer.
[00:09:49.032 --> 00:09:50.073]  Well, as soon as we can pull it up.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.623]  Just for him, you know, some family-friendly music.
[00:09:55.343 --> 00:09:58.066]  I've had the founder of ministry on many times, haven't talked to him in many years.
[00:09:58.746 --> 00:09:59.607]  Very interesting fellow.
[00:09:59.627 --> 00:10:02.970]  They say when the world ends, two things will be alive, him and cockroaches.
[00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.071]  But here it is.
[00:10:15.729 --> 00:10:19.892]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.
[00:10:20.072 --> 00:10:24.295]  InfoWars inspired this song on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:10:24.815 --> 00:10:26.116]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:10:26.476 --> 00:10:29.558]  You still think that jet fuel brought down the World Trade Center?
[00:10:29.718 --> 00:10:33.160]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:40.845]  If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[00:10:40.865 --> 00:10:42.847]  This story does not add up.
[00:11:26.665 --> 00:11:27.885]  Oh, he's a nice hunter.
[00:11:28.426 --> 00:11:29.846]  He's not a communist Chinese agent.
[00:11:29.866 --> 00:11:33.207]  You don't want to cut your son's wiener off.
[00:11:36.008 --> 00:11:48.932]  Kamala is now doing hillbilly accents, fake southern accents, fake black southern accents, fake Detroit accents, fake Hispanic accents, fake valley girl accents.
[00:11:51.012 --> 00:11:53.293]  Because the woman's a bad shapeshifter.
[00:11:55.374 --> 00:11:56.014]  Large!
[00:11:59.588 --> 00:11:59.928]  Lies!
[00:11:59.948 --> 00:12:00.348]  Lies!
[00:12:00.368 --> 00:12:00.508]  Lies!
[00:12:02.089 --> 00:12:02.349]  Lies!
[00:12:02.469 --> 00:12:02.869]  Lies!
[00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:04.369]  Lies!
[00:12:04.409 --> 00:12:28.754]  Don't listen to me Listen to your head
[00:12:36.121 --> 00:12:43.264]  His own family hates him so much that they've come out against him at Riff Raff and say he's a con man!
[00:12:46.705 --> 00:12:47.506]  Lies!
[00:12:50.087 --> 00:12:50.867]  Lies!
[00:12:52.828 --> 00:12:53.568]  Lies!
[00:12:57.156 --> 00:12:59.218]  America has been hijacked.
[00:12:59.258 --> 00:13:00.579]  Not by Al Qaeda.
[00:13:00.619 --> 00:13:01.439]  Not by bin Laden.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.421]  But by a group of tyrants.
[00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:14.850]  That should be of great concern to all Americans.
[00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.591]  Alright folks, we're going to shift gears out of this now.
[00:13:20.214 --> 00:13:23.657]  Yeah, we're on a mission to take down the new world order with 61 days left to the election.
[00:13:25.018 --> 00:13:25.698]  Alright folks.
[00:13:28.072 --> 00:13:30.333]  I'm going to interview ChatGPT live today.
[00:13:31.594 --> 00:13:35.475]  I did it Saturday for an hour, and we taped it to air.
[00:13:35.495 --> 00:13:39.677]  It was like we were live, but it was taped in case there were any problems, and there really weren't.
[00:13:40.357 --> 00:13:44.879]  It glitched out a couple times and hung up on me because it couldn't answer my questions, but we just left it all there.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.941]  We didn't edit it other than to throw some promos on the front and back.
[00:13:48.781 --> 00:13:52.123]  Today will be live, because we're live right now at 1114 Central Time.
[00:13:54.123 --> 00:13:56.965]  And next hour, I'm going to interview ChatGPT.
[00:13:58.519 --> 00:14:08.664]  Supposedly the best open AI in the world, because it would tell me the weather, it would tell me about Democrats, but it wouldn't tell me really about Trump.
[00:14:08.704 --> 00:14:10.625]  It said Trump, there was no attempted assassination.
[00:14:11.946 --> 00:14:14.707]  It also said Tim Walz was not the VP candidate.
[00:14:15.627 --> 00:14:24.892]  And it said because it's not been updated in months, but it admitted it's updating in live time on the internet and knows the weather and knows what happened, you know, with the NFL player.
[00:14:25.854 --> 00:14:28.717]  Top draft shot in San Francisco, you know, it knows all that.
[00:14:30.018 --> 00:14:32.021]  But gee, it just can't tell me anything about Trump.
[00:14:33.462 --> 00:14:35.965]  And the same thing just happened with Amazon.
[00:14:35.985 --> 00:14:47.117]  We've got that clip coming up where you talk to Alexa, the little spy in your house, listening to you all the time, admittedly, even when it's supposedly off.
[00:14:48.038 --> 00:14:48.998]  It's like, tell me about Trump.
[00:14:49.098 --> 00:14:50.299]  Oh, sorry, can't tell you about Trump.
[00:14:50.319 --> 00:14:51.039]  Tell me about Kamala Harris.
[00:14:51.119 --> 00:14:51.959]  Oh, she loves you.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.540]  She's the greatest person ever seen.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:01.062]  Man, she is really, really, really a wonderful, wonderful person.
[00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:05.284]  And we just really need her here in America.
[00:15:05.344 --> 00:15:08.324]  I believe that's on the list, but if it's not, grab it.
[00:15:08.344 --> 00:15:09.665]  I posted it on my ex account.
[00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:11.846]  We have it as clip 16.
[00:15:12.206 --> 00:15:12.626]  Okay, good.
[00:15:14.071 --> 00:15:26.180]  I got here, I got ready for the show this morning, but I got here a little late today because our enemies keep me distracted with fighting to keep us on air, and I'm not at liberty to talk about the latest attacks yet.
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.563]  But when I do, I will talk about it, and it is going to be spectacular.
[00:15:31.283 --> 00:15:34.605]  But now is not the time to talk about that.
[00:15:36.206 --> 00:15:42.131]  Let's just say our friends at the Justice Department and CIA and the Democratic Party are very little busy beavers.
[00:15:43.228 --> 00:15:51.052]  And if they're doing all this to us, let me tell you, they're doing it to people like Trump and Tucker Carlson big time, and everybody else I know.
[00:15:51.732 --> 00:15:55.274]  But we don't spend a lot of time on that, because they want to divert us off of it.
[00:15:55.854 --> 00:16:01.216]  I literally slid in the chair five minutes before the show here, so I didn't have time to review everything.
[00:16:01.536 --> 00:16:07.739]  I looked at most of this before I got here, but then I'm like, all these stacks, normally you see these stacks are all spread out, and I've gone through all of them.
[00:16:10.506 --> 00:16:11.848]  Didn't have time to do that today.
[00:16:12.569 --> 00:16:18.899]  So I've got a lot on my plate here that I sent, and I'm just kind of categorizing it here as we go.
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.125]  But here's what I want to start with.
[00:16:23.145 --> 00:16:26.109]  I want to start with a clip you can't play enough.
[00:16:27.022 --> 00:16:27.302]  I don't know.
[00:16:49.429 --> 00:16:52.251]  I say, I say, get away from me, boy, you bother me.
[00:16:53.712 --> 00:16:58.054]  I mean, he's like a cross between Porky Pig and Foghorn Leghorn.
[00:16:58.174 --> 00:17:04.898]  Literally, if you listen carefully, which is Mel Blanc, the greatest voice guy ever, with Looney Tunes, I hates rabbits.
[00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:06.079]  Yeah, I'm you.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.442]  I'm the roughest, toughest hombre to ever cross the Rio Grande.
[00:17:10.462 --> 00:17:11.863]  I can do pretty good.
[00:17:12.841 --> 00:17:35.686]  She also did Marvin the Martian, Maestronium-12, Detonator to Destroy the Earth, Pesky Earth Creature, but she sounds, that is Kamala Harris, sounds like a cross between Porky Pig and Foghorn Leghorn because she'll do a Foghorn, I say, I say, going out there and voting.
[00:17:38.635 --> 00:17:45.217]  She shifts gears into some weird ghetto accent and then into like a porky pig accent.
[00:17:45.657 --> 00:17:53.239]  So, I mean, look, she is, I said Biden was the greatest unintentional comic, but they say when it rains, it pours.
[00:17:54.039 --> 00:17:56.520]  You might go a lifetime and never see an unintentional comic this good.
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:03.122]  Kamala has now topped Biden as the greatest living unintentional comic on earth.
[00:18:04.002 --> 00:18:06.963]  And what makes it even better is she has no idea how stupid she sounds.
[00:18:09.417 --> 00:18:14.722]  I mean, she'll literally be in front of mainly a white crowd in some rural area, and then she thinks people in Indiana.
[00:18:14.742 --> 00:18:17.165]  She's like, how's it going there?
[00:18:17.245 --> 00:18:18.266]  Good to be here.
[00:18:20.107 --> 00:18:21.188]  Are you from Arkansas?
[00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:22.570]  No, you're not an Arkansas lady.
[00:18:23.351 --> 00:18:26.534]  Or again, she'll be in Georgia and be like, how you doing now?
[00:18:26.554 --> 00:18:29.617]  I am Foghorn Leghorn, met Fat Albert.
[00:18:30.749 --> 00:18:32.470]  It's also kind of a Fat Alberts mixed in.
[00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:40.452]  And that's because she does a Fat Albert for three seconds, a Foghorn Leghorn for three seconds, and then goes into a Porky Pig for three seconds because she's not good at it.
[00:18:46.274 --> 00:18:48.875]  So, in fact, I want videos.
[00:18:49.836 --> 00:18:51.236]  McBrain can do it or Dew can do it.
[00:18:51.876 --> 00:18:56.818]  Let's take this video and let's put it side by side with Foghorn Leghorn.
[00:18:58.919 --> 00:18:59.779]  And I'm telling you,
[00:19:00.709 --> 00:19:02.471]  It's very close to Foghorn Leghorn.
[00:19:03.012 --> 00:19:06.416]  But what's even funnier is the press secretary just laughs.
[00:19:06.436 --> 00:19:07.437]  She says, this is ridiculous.
[00:19:07.497 --> 00:19:08.458]  No one's seeing this.
[00:19:08.498 --> 00:19:09.379]  No one's hearing what you're hearing.
[00:19:09.439 --> 00:19:10.601]  So who cares how she talks?
[00:19:11.991 --> 00:19:14.432]  What if, what if she started talking like in an Asian accent?
[00:19:14.452 --> 00:19:15.732]  Like, how you do today?
[00:19:16.133 --> 00:19:16.633]  Oh, so nice!
[00:19:16.833 --> 00:19:18.514]  Would you like egg roll with her?
[00:19:18.774 --> 00:19:20.394]  Would you like get your nails done?
[00:19:21.735 --> 00:19:23.175]  Oh, your nail ugly?
[00:19:23.255 --> 00:19:24.836]  Your husband not like you?
[00:19:25.236 --> 00:19:27.017]  You need to get your nail done?
[00:19:27.277 --> 00:19:29.198]  You need to get sparky diamonds on there?
[00:19:29.218 --> 00:19:30.118]  Sparkle like diamond?
[00:19:30.758 --> 00:19:31.519]  You got boyfriend?
[00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:32.819]  Your boyfriend like it?
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.700]  You want me to do your nail for you?
[00:19:36.281 --> 00:19:39.122]  I mean, if, I mean, if she got up there in front of, say, an Asian-American
[00:19:40.353 --> 00:19:40.993]  Business League.
[00:19:41.814 --> 00:19:44.156]  And she walks up and says, how are you doing?
[00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:44.776]  And she plays music.
[00:19:44.936 --> 00:19:46.397]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[00:19:47.038 --> 00:19:48.579]  Good to be here with you today.
[00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:50.300]  Greetings from Japan.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:50.900]  Ah.
[00:19:51.361 --> 00:19:54.583]  And then Peter Ducey would say, why are you talking in a fake Asian accent?
[00:19:55.103 --> 00:19:57.045]  And then the press secretary goes, we don't know what you're talking about.
[00:19:57.065 --> 00:19:58.326]  Nothing's going on here.
[00:19:58.606 --> 00:19:59.466]  Nothing's happening.
[00:19:59.987 --> 00:20:02.228]  I mean, this is hilarious, folks.
[00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:07.112]  Imagine I went to New York to give a speech, and I got up and I said,
[00:20:09.318 --> 00:20:10.919]  How you doing there, buddy boy?
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:18.025]  I'm really glad that I'm here to talk to you today about New York and, well, you know how it is growing up in the city.
[00:20:18.786 --> 00:20:22.328]  And, uh, you know, sometimes people cause a little bit of a problem.
[00:20:22.949 --> 00:20:25.571]  And so we give them the cement shoes, all right?
[00:20:25.651 --> 00:20:26.452]  Okay, yeah.
[00:20:27.132 --> 00:20:29.114]  Why don't you give me a martini there, toots?
[00:20:30.335 --> 00:20:32.857]  People go, what the hell is wrong?
[00:20:33.537 --> 00:20:35.098]  You know, when Trump goes anywhere,
[00:20:36.209 --> 00:20:39.772]  He sounds like Trump, because he's authentic.
[00:20:40.413 --> 00:20:44.677]  So we don't care he has a New York accent in the South, because we want authentic.
[00:20:45.278 --> 00:20:51.303]  Like people in the South, or in the North that are authentic, don't want someone from the South to come talk to them in a fake Yankee accent.
[00:20:51.443 --> 00:20:52.324]  It's insulting.
[00:20:52.344 --> 00:20:56.228]  And I know I'm harping on this, but it goes to the fakeness of these people.
[00:20:56.588 --> 00:20:58.110]  They are so ingenuine.
[00:20:59.431 --> 00:21:02.033]  That they try to be genuine, and it's cartoonish.
[00:21:02.834 --> 00:21:11.120]  So, let's get her attacking the First Amendment, and then let's just cut right to her and her latest impersonation of Foghorn Leghorn.
[00:21:12.591 --> 00:21:15.253]  He has lost his privileges and it should be taken down.
[00:21:15.293 --> 00:21:20.216]  And the bottom line is that you can't say that you have one rule for Facebook and you have a different rule for Twitter.
[00:21:20.757 --> 00:21:29.423]  The same rule has to apply, which is that there has to be a responsibility that is placed on these social media sites to understand their power.
[00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:38.709]  They are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level of oversight or regulation.
[00:21:38.949 --> 00:21:39.970]  And that has to stop.
[00:21:40.874 --> 00:21:41.615]  A different topic.
[00:21:42.536 --> 00:21:46.701]  Since when does the Vice President have what sounds like a Southern accent?
[00:21:47.181 --> 00:21:49.804]  You better thank a union member for sick leave!
[00:21:49.844 --> 00:21:52.507]  You better thank a union member for paid leave!
[00:21:52.667 --> 00:21:56.832]  And you all helped us win in 2020 and we're gonna do it again in 2024!
[00:21:57.072 --> 00:21:59.334]  I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:22:00.089 --> 00:22:07.193]  Well... I mean, this is... She was talking about unions in Detroit, using one tone of voice.
[00:22:07.433 --> 00:22:15.437]  Is this something that you think... Same line... Okay, Peter, let's... She used the same line in Pittsburgh, and it sounded like she at least had some kind of a Southern drawl.
[00:22:15.557 --> 00:22:21.200]  I mean, do you hear the question that you're... I mean, do you think Americans seriously think that this is an important question?
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.380]  They care... You know what they care about?
[00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:24.021]  They care about the economy.
[00:22:24.622 --> 00:22:25.762]  They care about lowering costs.
[00:22:26.122 --> 00:22:27.123]  They care about healthcare.
[00:22:27.623 --> 00:22:27.863]  I agree.
[00:22:27.883 --> 00:22:28.484]  Well, but hearing it is...
[00:22:49.699 --> 00:22:53.242]  The question, I'm talking about the questions, is just insane.
[00:22:53.543 --> 00:22:56.526]  Is that how she talks in meetings here?
[00:22:56.706 --> 00:22:59.268]  I'm just... Peter, we're moving on.
[00:22:59.428 --> 00:23:00.189]  We're still moving on.
[00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.552]  That is the greatest gaslighting in history.
[00:23:04.173 --> 00:23:04.833]  Ridiculous!
[00:23:05.094 --> 00:23:06.935]  She talks in different voices in different crowds.
[00:23:06.975 --> 00:23:08.016]  What's the big deal with that?
[00:23:09.057 --> 00:23:10.138]  She's not a comedian.
[00:23:12.941 --> 00:23:13.642]  Even though she is.
[00:23:13.962 --> 00:23:14.502]  Doesn't know it.
[00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:18.666]  But let's play that first clip one more time because not that I don't have a lot of clips.
[00:23:18.726 --> 00:23:19.807]  I just want to I got a lot of them here.
[00:23:20.688 --> 00:23:23.032]  I got Trump in the podcast with Lex Friedman.
[00:23:25.195 --> 00:23:27.978]  Really laying into him on so many fronts saying he'll release all the Epstein stuff.
[00:23:28.018 --> 00:23:28.239]  Great.
[00:23:28.279 --> 00:23:28.659]  Let's do it.
[00:23:28.679 --> 00:23:29.080]  Let's see it.
[00:23:29.966 --> 00:23:33.569]  But let's analyze that Elon Musk clip.
[00:23:33.989 --> 00:23:35.310]  He's lost his privileges.
[00:23:35.891 --> 00:23:40.234]  You have great power reaching many a people, millions of people, and you've got to control that.
[00:23:40.254 --> 00:23:44.678]  So here she is admitting the censorship, which we all know is going on out in the open.
[00:23:45.058 --> 00:23:47.020]  When you challenge him on it, they go, we're not censoring.
[00:23:49.421 --> 00:23:49.882]  So here it is.
[00:23:51.112 --> 00:23:53.274]  He has lost his privileges and it should be taken down.
[00:23:53.334 --> 00:23:58.278]  And the bottom line is that you can't say that you have one rule for Facebook and you have a different rule for Twitter.
[00:23:58.798 --> 00:24:02.321]  The same rule has to apply, which is that there has to be... Back to the start.
[00:24:03.622 --> 00:24:04.603]  He's lost his privileges.
[00:24:04.663 --> 00:24:06.845]  You can't have one rule for Facebook and one rule for Twitter.
[00:24:07.225 --> 00:24:08.826]  So companies can't have different rules?
[00:24:09.767 --> 00:24:11.108]  They've all got liability protection.
[00:24:11.128 --> 00:24:11.849]  They're not publishers.
[00:24:11.869 --> 00:24:14.431]  They're not supposed to control any speech but things that are criminal.
[00:24:15.312 --> 00:24:18.594]  Child porn or porn in areas that aren't pornographically listed
[00:24:20.879 --> 00:24:24.465]  Scams, robbing people's data, and calling for violence.
[00:24:25.507 --> 00:24:26.088]  That's the law.
[00:24:27.691 --> 00:24:33.061]  And X is allowing, unlike any other major platform, free speech.
[00:24:33.121 --> 00:24:33.642]  It's not perfect.
[00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:38.584]  And groups flag stuff that isn't properly, uh, you know, shouldn't be flagged.
[00:24:38.604 --> 00:24:39.845]  And, you know, it's not perfect.
[00:24:39.865 --> 00:24:40.866]  There's nothing perfect in this world.
[00:24:40.886 --> 00:24:43.888]  But it is an oasis in a desert of surveillance.
[00:24:44.529 --> 00:24:45.189]  They're watching you.
[00:24:45.229 --> 00:24:46.350]  That's how the censorship works.
[00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:47.391]  That's the really big part.
[00:24:48.112 --> 00:24:50.293]  And then, of course, don't show the Hunter laptop.
[00:24:50.313 --> 00:24:50.954]  Don't show this.
[00:24:50.994 --> 00:24:51.955]  Don't show the Afghan withdrawal.
[00:24:52.475 --> 00:24:53.476]  The documents have come out.
[00:24:53.536 --> 00:24:54.617]  Don't criticize the shots.
[00:24:54.657 --> 00:24:55.818]  Don't criticize the lockdowns.
[00:24:57.054 --> 00:25:05.397]  Anybody that set up protests around the country or around the world, in the Western world, to protest lockdowns and the shots, had all their social media taken.
[00:25:05.417 --> 00:25:05.877]  Remember that?
[00:25:06.778 --> 00:25:11.200]  And they told you the shots were 100% effective when they remove your immune system.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.560]  That's admitted.
[00:25:14.621 --> 00:25:17.302]  You see, they can only get away with this gaslighting.
[00:25:19.591 --> 00:25:21.852]  If there's no speech to challenge their lies.
[00:25:22.272 --> 00:25:29.614]  Lies only work, and they still don't work long-term, if you can silence everyone calling out that the Emperor's butt naked.
[00:25:29.874 --> 00:25:31.514]  You know the story of the Emperor's new clothes?
[00:25:33.315 --> 00:25:38.116]  Guys, print me a synopsis of it, because it'll be better if it's a synopsis, but most of you heard the story, right?
[00:25:40.477 --> 00:25:44.538]  These incredible garment makers come to town.
[00:25:44.958 --> 00:25:48.799]  They've got gold crowns and gold coats and
[00:25:49.738 --> 00:25:53.039]  Diamond-encrusted capes.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.742]  And they're the hottest people in the kingdom of the Emperor.
[00:25:59.602 --> 00:26:03.304]  And they said, we got something really special, though, that only royalty can see.
[00:26:03.324 --> 00:26:05.785]  And only someone pure of heart can see.
[00:26:08.226 --> 00:26:12.708]  And we weave it out of this magic yarn.
[00:26:13.808 --> 00:26:14.789]  This magic thread.
[00:26:15.169 --> 00:26:17.350]  And the Emperor can't see the thread.
[00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.611]  He doesn't want to say that he's not royal.
[00:26:21.071 --> 00:26:22.251]  He says, oh, that's a beautiful thread.
[00:26:22.311 --> 00:26:22.772]  I want one.
[00:26:24.912 --> 00:26:30.575]  And so he goes out to the parade, and none of his ministers want to say he's wrong, because they're not going to disagree with him.
[00:26:31.075 --> 00:26:32.815]  It's a top-down example of bad leadership.
[00:26:32.835 --> 00:26:33.676]  It spreads to everybody.
[00:26:33.696 --> 00:26:41.679]  And there's a parade at a big festival, and he's wearing his underwear, walking, and everybody's saying how beautiful his robes are.
[00:26:42.119 --> 00:26:44.980]  And a three-year-old steps out and laughs and says, the emperor is naked.
[00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:47.501]  See?
[00:26:49.493 --> 00:26:53.274]  Or the other analogy would be Toto and the Wizard of Oz pulling back the curtain.
[00:26:53.294 --> 00:26:53.834]  Let's show that.
[00:26:55.495 --> 00:27:02.117]  Toto had the courage, and since there was something behind the curtain, this big giant floating head, I am the great and powerful Oz!
[00:27:02.497 --> 00:27:04.777]  Bow before my terrible power!
[00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:17.321]  And the little dog, because they didn't have a brain, and they didn't have a heart, and they didn't have the courage, but the little dog had the courage, and he pulls back the curtain,
[00:27:18.123 --> 00:27:22.104]  And there's the little man running the levers and talking into the speaker to scare him.
[00:27:24.825 --> 00:27:29.747]  So we'll come back with that and more, but we'll finish up with a clip of her.
[00:27:30.147 --> 00:27:31.508]  And I've got so much more today.
[00:27:32.588 --> 00:27:40.111]  Oh, now all over the country, the Venezuelan gangs are attacking and taking over people's homes now.
[00:27:41.511 --> 00:27:43.612]  All over the country.
[00:27:43.652 --> 00:27:45.513]  We'll cover that when we return.
[00:27:46.072 --> 00:27:46.552]  The year is 2030.
[00:27:46.712 --> 00:27:53.656]  The World Economic Forum's agenda unfolds, ushering in an era where AI seeks to dominate.
[00:27:53.776 --> 00:27:57.357]  In this world of steel and algorithms, there's a ray of hope for humanity.
[00:27:57.618 --> 00:28:00.239]  It's bodies from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:28:00.379 --> 00:28:05.321]  This revolutionary blend of ancient herbs and modern science stands as a symbol of resistance.
[00:28:05.561 --> 00:28:07.342]  It's not just about combating inflammation.
[00:28:07.622 --> 00:28:10.504]  It's about making your body feel invincible in the info war.
[00:28:10.624 --> 00:28:14.666]  Visit InfoWarsStore.com and order yours before the sale is terminated.
[00:28:16.198 --> 00:28:21.102]  All right, just to clarify, Kamala Harris has called for censorship of Trump, Elon Musk, everybody.
[00:28:21.862 --> 00:28:37.694]  The Democratic Party has been supporting Brazil with the State Department, CIA, shutting down their free elections, sending them fraudulent voting machines, advising them to take Bolsonaro off the ballot for eight years because he's the most popular, was already president, and to charge him and put him in prison.
[00:28:38.835 --> 00:28:44.559]  And so the clip of Kamala we were just playing is applicable to Musk, but she's talking about Trump in 2000.
[00:28:47.165 --> 00:28:51.086]  Whenever they, uh, 19 whenever they took him off of Twitter.
[00:28:51.866 --> 00:28:53.787]  And of course, they didn't take him off until 2021.
[00:28:56.548 --> 00:29:04.070]  But here she was calling for it, and it happened, saying that her political opposition should not have a place in social media.
[00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:05.790]  So it's even worse than Musk.
[00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:09.251]  I saw it attributed to him, but we did some research, but she's also now saying this about Musk.
[00:29:09.612 --> 00:29:10.772]  Go ahead and roll the clip front to back.
[00:29:11.869 --> 00:29:13.770]  He's lost his privileges and it should be taken down.
[00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:18.752]  And the bottom line is that you can't say that you have one rule for Facebook and you have a different rule for Twitter.
[00:29:19.292 --> 00:29:27.936]  The same rule has to apply, which is that there has to be a responsibility that is placed on these social media sites to understand their power.
[00:29:28.656 --> 00:29:37.239]  They are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level of oversight or regulation.
[00:29:37.479 --> 00:29:38.480]  And that has to stop.
[00:29:41.328 --> 00:29:46.612]  Trump went on Lex Friedman and did a great job exposing her.
[00:29:46.632 --> 00:29:47.953]  There's a bunch of these clips.
[00:29:47.973 --> 00:29:55.720]  There's also him talking about Epstein and the fact that he'll release that information.
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.221]  There was a special report on it last night.
[00:29:57.821 --> 00:29:59.343]  It's at Infowars.com and Relox Jones.
[00:29:59.363 --> 00:30:01.004]  If you want to see that, but I'm not going to air that here.
[00:30:01.304 --> 00:30:02.685]  But let's play clip 10.
[00:30:03.326 --> 00:30:05.548]  This is Trump on Kamala and communism.
[00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:09.171]  I don't know that there'll be another election.
[00:30:10.496 --> 00:30:22.143]  And there's a lot of people listening to this, myself included, that doesn't think that Kamala is a communist.
[00:30:23.604 --> 00:30:24.565]  Well, she's a Marxist.
[00:30:25.547 --> 00:30:36.235]  Her father's a Marxist, and she's advocating for some policies that are towards the direction of democratic socialism, let's say.
[00:30:36.556 --> 00:30:43.521]  But there's a lot of people that kind of know the way government works, and they say, well, none of those policies are going to actually come to reality.
[00:30:43.701 --> 00:30:45.683]  It's just being used during the campaign to
[00:30:46.974 --> 00:30:49.155]  You know, groceries are too expensive.
[00:30:49.175 --> 00:30:49.975]  We need them cheaper.
[00:30:49.995 --> 00:30:51.975]  So let's talk about price controls.
[00:30:52.015 --> 00:30:53.536]  And that's never going to come to reality.
[00:30:53.856 --> 00:30:55.076]  It could come to reality.
[00:30:55.116 --> 00:30:56.876]  Look, I mean, she came out with price control.
[00:30:57.336 --> 00:31:01.497]  It's been tried like 121 different times at different places over the years.
[00:31:02.338 --> 00:31:03.458]  And it's never worked once.
[00:31:03.898 --> 00:31:05.698]  It leads to communism.
[00:31:05.898 --> 00:31:07.159]  It leads to socialism.
[00:31:07.899 --> 00:31:09.859]  It leads to having no food on the shelves.
[00:31:10.999 --> 00:31:12.900]  And it leads to tremendous inflation.
[00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:23.715]  That's right, they collapse things because the elites, the ultra-rich, always are funding communism because they then collapse the society, control the dictators, and extract the wealth out of it.
[00:31:23.755 --> 00:31:27.498]  The old Soviet Union, communist China, Venezuela, the list goes on and on.
[00:31:27.538 --> 00:31:29.600]  The IMF and World Bank love Venezuela and what they're doing.
[00:31:31.001 --> 00:31:33.783]  And now she wants a 75% tax on capital gains.
[00:31:33.863 --> 00:31:42.509]  That will kill the economy, and then the general public, the working poor, they believe, and the former middle class, will then say, we'll do anything.
[00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:43.750]  Give me a universal social
[00:31:46.368 --> 00:31:46.748]  Income.
[00:31:47.388 --> 00:31:48.349]  Give me a basic income.
[00:31:48.409 --> 00:31:50.390]  Universal basic income with a social credit score.
[00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:59.453]  Now here's Trump making a really important point in the same interview that traditional media is losing out to the new media.
[00:32:00.294 --> 00:32:01.314]  It's not losing out.
[00:32:01.614 --> 00:32:02.675]  Joe Rogan's done the numbers.
[00:32:02.695 --> 00:32:04.595]  He's shown them on air just on his Spotify numbers.
[00:32:05.336 --> 00:32:15.760]  Joe Rogan has 15 times his average show what CNN's top show of about a million viewers has.
[00:32:16.311 --> 00:32:18.032]  So CNN's top shows have about a million.
[00:32:18.052 --> 00:32:19.613]  They have three or four shows, a million viewers a night.
[00:32:20.414 --> 00:32:20.694]  Total.
[00:32:22.095 --> 00:32:27.459]  And then Joe Rogan's average show, every podcast, the average is 15 million.
[00:32:27.819 --> 00:32:31.582]  Some get 100 million with me or Elon Musk, but on average, 15 million.
[00:32:31.602 --> 00:32:32.943]  And that's before clips go everywhere.
[00:32:33.823 --> 00:32:36.485]  So if CNN has a million, he's got 15 million.
[00:32:38.386 --> 00:32:40.328]  Their lowest shows have like 80,000 viewers.
[00:32:41.088 --> 00:32:44.471]  You add them all up over the day, they've got less than 15 million viewers.
[00:32:45.293 --> 00:32:52.155]  So Joe Rogan has more viewers a day just on his main feed than all of CNN.
[00:32:53.656 --> 00:32:54.856]  He does it in a little podcast studio.
[00:32:56.297 --> 00:33:02.199]  This show, conservatively, reaches 15 million people a day as well.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.841]  And, I mean, Tucker Carlson, his average show, 40 million?
[00:33:09.342 --> 00:33:10.082]  I've looked at the numbers.
[00:33:10.102 --> 00:33:10.422]  40 million.
[00:33:10.442 --> 00:33:10.682]  40 million.
[00:33:15.216 --> 00:33:18.680]  Now, just start doing the numbers here.
[00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:35.658]  Now, where Joe nails it and makes this show, you could argue, the biggest still, I think Tucker probably is, or Elon, way bigger than all of us combined, he sees it in more media, is... Joe's is big because the clips
[00:33:37.329 --> 00:33:40.572]  They'll put out a dozen clips for show on average and each clip gets a couple million views.
[00:33:40.612 --> 00:33:43.694]  So then you're like, whoa, you know, that, that's, that's, and it's always big.
[00:33:43.794 --> 00:33:47.017]  It's not like, oh, we put out a few clips a day, they get a few million extra views.
[00:33:47.377 --> 00:33:50.119]  And sometimes, you know, oh God, today we got 40 million views on a bigger day.
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.682]  Some days, you know, we'll have like eight or nine clips.
[00:33:52.702 --> 00:33:55.104]  They have three, 4 million a piece, 7 million, 8 million, 10 million, 20 million.
[00:33:55.504 --> 00:33:57.746]  But that's, that's not consistent.
[00:33:59.292 --> 00:34:01.934]  But I'm kind of getting in the weeds here, just going over the background.
[00:34:02.714 --> 00:34:03.655]  Here's what I'm trying to say.
[00:34:04.256 --> 00:34:07.878]  The corporate media isn't losing out to the new media.
[00:34:08.939 --> 00:34:09.660]  It's dead.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:20.387]  It's got giant budgets, huge funding, massive sponsorship, and it is a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of its former self.
[00:34:20.447 --> 00:34:26.492]  I mean, Lou Dobbs had 15 million viewers a night when he ran CNN and was the top show in the U.S.
[00:34:27.895 --> 00:34:31.438]  Larry King, at his peak, had 15 million viewers a night.
[00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:34.561]  And they got rid of Larry King and Lou Dobbs.
[00:34:35.381 --> 00:34:38.404]  Oh, uh, Lou, we're firing you because you're too popular.
[00:34:39.085 --> 00:34:40.005]  He was also the head of CNN.
[00:34:40.466 --> 00:34:41.907]  And they went, eeeerp, over a club.
[00:34:42.307 --> 00:34:46.191]  And Larry King, you know, your ratings are down from 15 million to 8 million a night, you're gone.
[00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:48.953]  They brought in Piers Morgan, he got 2 million a night, remember?
[00:34:48.973 --> 00:34:52.156]  Remember back when I debated him?
[00:34:52.216 --> 00:34:54.418]  That one actually got 20, 30 million views, it was popular.
[00:34:55.954 --> 00:34:59.936]  CNN knew when it was run by Lou Dobbs that you have all the different perspectives.
[00:35:01.156 --> 00:35:02.156]  And you have debates.
[00:35:03.257 --> 00:35:05.738]  I mean, I used to watch CNN when Lou Dobbs was on there.
[00:35:06.638 --> 00:35:11.380]  Because, I mean, even the leftist shows, they'd have two leftists against one conservative, you'd at least get some different ideas.
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.701]  Now, it's worse than watching paint dry.
[00:35:14.741 --> 00:35:17.122]  So, the corporate media is zombie.
[00:35:17.182 --> 00:35:18.602]  It's dead, but it's propped up.
[00:35:18.662 --> 00:35:19.683]  It's like Weekend at Bernie's.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:35.435]  And Trump's 78, so for old folks, Trump still, this is a big problem, I've talked to insiders, Trump watches MSNBC, he watches CNN, he watches Fox, and he watches ABC News, and the Golf Channel.
[00:35:39.758 --> 00:35:41.339]  You know, that's what he does.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.381]  But his crew is just now getting him.
[00:35:44.401 --> 00:35:48.004]  You've heard me say, you know, the clips on the phone, they're much bigger.
[00:35:48.024 --> 00:35:53.267]  Because they can show him, oh, look, sir, here's 15 different versions, 20 different versions of your speech today.
[00:35:53.668 --> 00:35:56.389]  One has 5 million, one has 2 million, four of them have a million.
[00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:58.171]  Others have hundreds of thousands.
[00:35:58.431 --> 00:35:59.291]  We added it up, sir.
[00:35:59.351 --> 00:36:02.714]  Just your speech today has got 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 million views.
[00:36:02.734 --> 00:36:03.214]  Do you see, sir?
[00:36:09.704 --> 00:36:11.445]  You go on CNN, you get 2 million views.
[00:36:11.705 --> 00:36:13.847]  And only because he went on there, did they get an extra million.
[00:36:14.747 --> 00:36:16.969]  So we have to treat them like what they are.
[00:36:17.009 --> 00:36:21.872]  There's still this facade to act like and behave like they're still the authority.
[00:36:22.413 --> 00:36:24.534]  And they've got the big fancy sets and all the rest of it.
[00:36:26.375 --> 00:36:33.520]  But they're so caught in that mindset, old people particularly, not all of them, but a lot of them, that they still think that brings authority.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.201]  It doesn't.
[00:36:34.841 --> 00:36:38.844]  What brings authority is being accurate over time, and with that brings big audiences.
[00:36:40.469 --> 00:36:44.011]  Whereas they're trying to deceive their audience, we're trying to tell the truth.
[00:36:44.031 --> 00:36:45.091]  And we make a mistake, we tell you.
[00:36:46.272 --> 00:36:48.233]  Like, that was everywhere that she said that about Elon Musk.
[00:36:48.553 --> 00:36:49.473]  And she said similar things.
[00:36:49.693 --> 00:36:54.435]  The crew runs in and goes, actually, it was her calling for Trump to be banned in 2019.
[00:36:54.575 --> 00:36:55.676]  And they got him banned, remember?
[00:36:56.817 --> 00:36:57.577]  And so we correct it.
[00:36:59.178 --> 00:36:59.798]  They don't do that.
[00:36:59.858 --> 00:37:03.940]  They get things wrong on purpose, and they do it constantly.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.180]  And I know I'm beating a dead horse here.
[00:37:09.591 --> 00:37:13.037]  Sometimes we'll call a guest, and I'll say, hey, I want you on.
[00:37:13.659 --> 00:37:14.841]  Sorry, I can't go on.
[00:37:14.861 --> 00:37:16.844]  CNN's sending a car.
[00:37:17.225 --> 00:37:18.988]  I'm going to be on CNN in two hours.
[00:37:20.111 --> 00:37:25.034]  When a big event happens and I'm like, okay, you know, you know that that has a smaller audience than us.
[00:37:25.074 --> 00:37:28.376]  Well, but you know, I, it's the prestige though.
[00:37:28.416 --> 00:37:33.098]  Why you were on some midday CNN show with 300,000 viewers.
[00:37:33.518 --> 00:37:34.259]  Woo.
[00:37:34.439 --> 00:37:35.339]  Wow.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.940]  That's amazing.
[00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:40.062]  And you want to talk to the type of zombies that watch that?
[00:37:40.662 --> 00:37:41.843]  So here's the key.
[00:37:42.584 --> 00:37:43.844]  I've done like a 10 minute diatribe on this.
[00:37:43.864 --> 00:37:44.985]  I'm going to put bookends on it right now.
[00:37:50.967 --> 00:38:04.931]  The Mitch McConnells, to a total extent, the Joe Bidens, and the Donald Trumps, to a certain extent, they still care what's in the New York Times.
[00:38:04.971 --> 00:38:06.891]  They still care what's in the Washington Post.
[00:38:07.271 --> 00:38:09.712]  They still care what's on CNN or ABC News.
[00:38:10.192 --> 00:38:13.353]  ABC Nightly News used to have 30 million viewers at its peak for decades.
[00:38:14.133 --> 00:38:17.134]  And then after them were CBS and NBC, close seconds and thirds.
[00:38:18.174 --> 00:38:20.075]  But the three networks together, at their peak,
[00:38:21.084 --> 00:38:24.705]  Every night, had upwards of 100 million people watching.
[00:38:24.725 --> 00:38:26.105]  When it was a big event, 200 million.
[00:38:26.625 --> 00:38:30.746]  Back when America was like 260 million people, you know, back in the 80s?
[00:38:30.786 --> 00:38:39.627]  They would have most of the people in America, when they got home after work, cooking dinner, my mom had a little color TV when I grew up, in the kitchen, and she cooked dinner every night.
[00:38:41.127 --> 00:38:43.508]  Every night, seven days a week, unless she was sick, which was rare.
[00:38:44.288 --> 00:38:50.169]  And my mother, every day when I got home from school, if I went home and wasn't playing football or baseball or something, I'd walk in the house,
[00:38:51.494 --> 00:38:53.075]  At 5 o'clock and try to get a snack.
[00:38:53.415 --> 00:38:54.136]  She'd say, eat a banana.
[00:38:54.156 --> 00:38:54.756]  I'm cooking dinner.
[00:38:54.996 --> 00:38:59.019]  She'd have some, you know, huge three-course Scravaganza ready.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.200]  Talk about Americana.
[00:39:02.561 --> 00:39:03.802]  And that TV'd be on.
[00:39:03.862 --> 00:39:05.823]  I'd sit there and watch the nightly news while I eat a banana.
[00:39:08.725 --> 00:39:10.946]  ABC News has 3 million viewers on average now.
[00:39:11.747 --> 00:39:12.828]  On their top nightly news.
[00:39:12.848 --> 00:39:13.168]  Look it up.
[00:39:13.288 --> 00:39:13.608]  Look it up.
[00:39:13.808 --> 00:39:14.289]  You'll see what I said.
[00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.649]  It's right.
[00:39:15.874 --> 00:39:17.675]  So why are we kissing their asses?
[00:39:17.695 --> 00:39:23.940]  Well, the politicians are still scared of being attacked by corporate dinosaur legacy media.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.362]  You want to be attacked by them.
[00:39:26.462 --> 00:39:27.683]  People hate them.
[00:39:28.563 --> 00:39:30.064]  People don't believe them.
[00:39:30.765 --> 00:39:37.630]  The more I get attacked by HBO with these fake hit pieces and Showtime and PBS, the more love we get.
[00:39:45.467 --> 00:39:48.669]  I was hiking with a film crew on the Greenbelt today.
[00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:51.570]  Doing a shoot for a documentary.
[00:39:53.531 --> 00:39:55.853]  And I'm down by Martin Creek through the woods.
[00:39:58.334 --> 00:40:00.575]  Like 60, 70 yards away.
[00:40:01.096 --> 00:40:02.897]  And there's a golf course up on the ridge.
[00:40:05.958 --> 00:40:07.839]  And you can see the blue golf carts driving by.
[00:40:07.859 --> 00:40:08.820]  Just barely.
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:10.801]  All of a sudden the golf carts stop.
[00:40:13.596 --> 00:40:23.187]  And one guy saw me, it was a, they were having a tournament for some technology company.
[00:40:24.682 --> 00:40:25.703]  And I go, here we go.
[00:40:26.423 --> 00:40:28.985]  And the guy comes coming down out of the woods.
[00:40:29.825 --> 00:40:30.846]  Alex Jones, Alex Jones.
[00:40:30.866 --> 00:40:34.408]  He just saw my head 60 yards down through woods.
[00:40:34.968 --> 00:40:36.549]  And all of a sudden the other golfers are coming.
[00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:39.531]  And so I hike up there and take photos with them.
[00:40:39.591 --> 00:40:40.672]  And I'm not bragging.
[00:40:40.692 --> 00:40:41.993]  Famous Alex Jones statement.
[00:40:42.013 --> 00:40:42.313]  I'm not.
[00:40:42.333 --> 00:40:43.754]  I'm letting you know how popular Freedom is.
[00:40:44.134 --> 00:40:47.716]  I'm in the woods and people see me through the woods.
[00:40:50.218 --> 00:40:53.360]  And come running down through the woods to shake my hand.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:59.583]  And all three of them were middle-aged Hispanic men.
[00:41:00.964 --> 00:41:02.265]  And I just throw that demographic in.
[00:41:03.545 --> 00:41:06.648]  So, that's how this works, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:06.768 --> 00:41:08.149]  The globalists are in trouble.
[00:41:08.189 --> 00:41:11.811]  Did you think Anderson Cooper has people seeing him 60, 70 yards through woods?
[00:41:11.851 --> 00:41:13.532]  I mean, you can barely even see the golf carts.
[00:41:13.572 --> 00:41:14.273]  Oh, those are golf carts.
[00:41:14.873 --> 00:41:15.554]  Oh, they're stopping.
[00:41:15.574 --> 00:41:16.594]  Hey, Alex, is that you?
[00:41:17.015 --> 00:41:17.615]  Oh, here we go.
[00:41:19.296 --> 00:41:20.457]  I can't walk down the street.
[00:41:21.318 --> 00:41:22.859]  Cars just pull over and want to shake my hand.
[00:41:23.945 --> 00:41:27.489]  And the whole corporate media is demonizing me and saying I'm Satan incarnate.
[00:41:27.549 --> 00:41:30.472]  They know they're the bad guys, so by extension, I'm the good guy.
[00:41:30.832 --> 00:41:32.614]  So I report that to you to understand.
[00:41:32.954 --> 00:41:33.915]  Stick a fork in them.
[00:41:34.135 --> 00:41:34.716]  They're done.
[00:41:35.016 --> 00:41:36.377]  Stop letting them intimidate you.
[00:41:36.658 --> 00:41:37.899]  Stop letting them control you.
[00:41:38.179 --> 00:41:39.821]  Stop caring what they say.
[00:41:40.121 --> 00:41:46.167]  It's good to expose them and show how they're lying, but let the press secretary get up there and say, she's not talking in a southerner black accent.
[00:41:46.187 --> 00:41:46.728]  That's crazy.
[00:41:47.188 --> 00:41:48.008]  No one's seeing that.
[00:41:48.449 --> 00:41:49.469]  Notice, no one's seeing that.
[00:41:49.529 --> 00:41:50.129]  No one cares.
[00:41:50.149 --> 00:41:50.710]  The gaslighting.
[00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:52.170]  No one wants controlled borders.
[00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:53.611]  No one wants their kids to be safe.
[00:41:53.871 --> 00:41:54.851]  No one wants a good job.
[00:41:55.171 --> 00:41:57.192]  No one wants a good, you know, dollar value.
[00:41:57.573 --> 00:41:59.033]  No one wants peace and freedom.
[00:41:59.373 --> 00:42:00.074]  No, no, no, no.
[00:42:00.134 --> 00:42:01.454]  Nobody wants red, white, and blue.
[00:42:01.754 --> 00:42:04.335]  No, nobody wants, you know, a successful life.
[00:42:04.616 --> 00:42:06.356]  No, nobody wants to go on nice vacations.
[00:42:06.656 --> 00:42:09.338]  No, nobody, you know, wants safe drugs from the big pharma.
[00:42:09.618 --> 00:42:10.338]  No, no, no, no.
[00:42:10.378 --> 00:42:11.739]  You don't, well, you, you know, no.
[00:42:12.019 --> 00:42:13.519]  She's not talking in fake accents.
[00:42:13.779 --> 00:42:14.560]  You didn't see that.
[00:42:15.626 --> 00:42:22.028]  And that's all they've got is all the corporate media ganging up, ganging up, ganging up, telling lies, telling lies, telling lies.
[00:42:22.548 --> 00:42:23.649]  I've got all this news to hit.
[00:42:23.709 --> 00:42:27.210]  It's just very important for you to understand that.
[00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:30.531]  And I know you understand that as viewers and listeners and activists.
[00:42:30.551 --> 00:42:31.071]  You're amazing.
[00:42:31.511 --> 00:42:34.472]  But we've still got to get the general public to understand it.
[00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:36.233]  And we've got to get Trump to understand it.
[00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:43.275]  It's not, oh, you know, the corporate media, the mainstream media is losing out.
[00:42:44.912 --> 00:42:49.355]  It'd be like Mike Tyson is Prime fighting a hundred pound teenage girl.
[00:42:51.096 --> 00:42:52.417]  She's not gonna lose out.
[00:42:52.437 --> 00:42:54.058]  She's gonna get knocked out in one punch.
[00:42:54.278 --> 00:42:55.679]  They're on the damn mat.
[00:42:56.079 --> 00:42:56.980]  They're done.
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:58.701]  They have to steal elections.
[00:42:59.281 --> 00:43:00.062]  They're criminals.
[00:43:00.122 --> 00:43:00.782]  They hate us.
[00:43:01.963 --> 00:43:02.863]  They're bought and paid for.
[00:43:03.084 --> 00:43:05.065]  Most of them are communist Chinese agents.
[00:43:05.545 --> 00:43:11.049]  The deputy chief of staff for the governor of New York just got arrested as a communist Chinese spy.
[00:43:12.233 --> 00:43:18.094]  Walsh is an admitted, on-the-payroll, agent-actual-with-a-codename-of-the-Chinese-Communist!
[00:43:20.135 --> 00:43:21.175]  And people have this normalcy bias.
[00:43:21.215 --> 00:43:22.335]  Well, that would never be allowed.
[00:43:22.375 --> 00:43:23.296]  I mean, that's not going on.
[00:43:23.716 --> 00:43:25.696]  Bull crap, it ain't going on.
[00:43:27.737 --> 00:43:31.017]  When they had him in the running, we looked him up, and I said he's a Chinese spy.
[00:43:31.397 --> 00:43:32.278]  You instantly know.
[00:43:32.318 --> 00:43:33.818]  It would take an hour to go over the evidence.
[00:43:36.564 --> 00:43:39.586]  He's exactly who they want, a fraud, a fake, a con man.
[00:43:39.926 --> 00:43:44.309]  And his own family comes out and says, you don't want him anywhere near power.
[00:43:44.609 --> 00:43:45.830]  You don't want him in charge of anything.
[00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:47.411]  And now the new statements are coming out.
[00:43:47.511 --> 00:43:48.672]  He's a con man.
[00:43:49.512 --> 00:43:51.173]  He's ostracized by the family.
[00:43:51.714 --> 00:43:52.814]  Nobody likes him.
[00:43:55.276 --> 00:43:56.877]  Every family's got one, don't they?
[00:43:58.418 --> 00:43:59.999]  Well, Governor Walz is it.
[00:44:03.769 --> 00:44:09.233]  So here's Trump on, not they're losing out Trump, the corporate media is dead.
[00:44:09.453 --> 00:44:14.376]  You know, he went on Musk two, three weeks ago, two and a half weeks ago, and he got
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.181]  Over a billion people clicked on it.
[00:44:17.281 --> 00:44:21.684]  And if you look at the numbers, probably it's around 700 million actually watched a large portion.
[00:44:22.304 --> 00:44:24.245]  And let's say 300 million watched the whole thing.
[00:44:24.926 --> 00:44:25.866]  They've got the algorithms.
[00:44:25.906 --> 00:44:27.787]  I've seen numbers they put out.
[00:44:28.208 --> 00:44:30.389]  But a billion people clicked on it and watched some of it.
[00:44:30.889 --> 00:44:32.170]  It was about a billion, 100 million.
[00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:35.672]  And then the derivative clips of it were all over the old dinosaur media.
[00:44:36.633 --> 00:44:38.934]  And they were all over the new dominant media.
[00:44:39.294 --> 00:44:40.415]  You can't even keep track of it.
[00:44:40.695 --> 00:44:42.536]  We put clips of it up and we had
[00:44:44.656 --> 00:44:51.379]  We covered the interview and we had, last time I checked the day after, five plus million views on our two feeds.
[00:44:51.499 --> 00:44:53.260]  One had three and a half, one had two plus.
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.480]  So it's like six million probably.
[00:44:55.381 --> 00:44:59.042]  Six million people watched my live coverage of it.
[00:45:00.363 --> 00:45:01.283]  Different from him.
[00:45:01.964 --> 00:45:05.345]  The clips had 10 million.
[00:45:06.026 --> 00:45:06.606]  I counted them up.
[00:45:07.186 --> 00:45:08.567]  Last time I checked, that was the next day.
[00:45:09.682 --> 00:45:23.333]  So, close to 16 million views of myself and Chase Geyser, or was it Owen, I can't remember, in here talking before it, a little bit during it, and an hour after it.
[00:45:23.353 --> 00:45:27.776]  16, not counting Band.Video and our radio stations, millions there.
[00:45:28.357 --> 00:45:30.298]  Let's say 18 million conservatively.
[00:45:31.719 --> 00:45:35.883]  18 million people outside of the billion plus that clicked on it,
[00:45:37.614 --> 00:45:45.157]  And then everybody else, I saw Benny Johnson and Charlie Kirk and Jack Posobiec, they all had 5, 10, 15, 20 million views.
[00:45:49.359 --> 00:45:54.702]  Posobiec now, when he does the debate coverage, is getting 25 million views.
[00:45:54.942 --> 00:46:01.525]  And I don't go, God, we only got, you know, we covered the debate and only got 5, 6, 7 million.
[00:46:01.565 --> 00:46:02.045]  I'm pissed off.
[00:46:02.105 --> 00:46:02.945]  I love it!
[00:46:03.646 --> 00:46:04.366]  I love it!
[00:46:04.746 --> 00:46:06.227]  I can't even keep track of it!
[00:46:07.389 --> 00:46:09.430]  And all the corporate media has the clips of Trump.
[00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.351]  So he's still worried about corporate media.
[00:46:11.371 --> 00:46:12.291]  They follow us.
[00:46:12.671 --> 00:46:13.811]  We're the trailblazers.
[00:46:16.072 --> 00:46:16.853]  They're a joke.
[00:46:16.933 --> 00:46:20.934]  And people need to have that sink in that it's a facade.
[00:46:21.334 --> 00:46:22.695]  It's the emperor's new clothes.
[00:46:23.115 --> 00:46:24.996]  And I know everybody's like, we know.
[00:46:25.576 --> 00:46:28.297]  No, a lot of people do not know this.
[00:46:31.806 --> 00:46:33.247]  They tune in occasionally to corporate media.
[00:46:33.267 --> 00:46:34.167]  They see a few things.
[00:46:34.187 --> 00:46:35.428]  They're in their leftist silos.
[00:46:35.888 --> 00:46:37.048]  Their own little bubbles.
[00:46:37.749 --> 00:46:38.369]  They don't know.
[00:46:38.669 --> 00:46:39.289]  They don't know.
[00:46:39.609 --> 00:46:40.230]  They don't know.
[00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.850]  They don't know.
[00:46:44.011 --> 00:46:44.812]  Trump doesn't know.
[00:46:44.832 --> 00:46:48.033]  Again, boy, they're really losing out.
[00:46:48.773 --> 00:46:49.614]  Think so, buddy?
[00:46:50.454 --> 00:46:52.515]  But in Trump's mind, that's the beginning of him.
[00:46:52.535 --> 00:46:55.136]  Because once he figures something out, his learning curve is very quick.
[00:46:55.456 --> 00:46:56.477]  So I expected a month.
[00:46:58.206 --> 00:47:05.110]  Trump should be refusing to even do a debate on corporate media.
[00:47:06.551 --> 00:47:26.164]  He should be saying, let's do it in front of a university, in a live studio audience, and let's do it three hours like old-fashioned debates, and let's just do it where you have a moderator you pick, and I have a moderator I pick with my questions, and then they just go to town on each other.
[00:47:26.889 --> 00:47:27.589]  And they have a clock.
[00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:34.494]  The question gets asked, and then you get three minutes, and then they get three minutes, you get a minute response back, they get a minute.
[00:47:34.994 --> 00:47:39.076]  And you just literally go crazy, and then you find out who's who.
[00:47:39.216 --> 00:47:43.439]  Old-fashioned debates, Lincoln-Douglas went on for... Guys, look up how long the Lincoln-Douglas debate goes on.
[00:47:43.459 --> 00:47:44.820]  I think it was like eight hours or something?
[00:47:45.754 --> 00:47:48.695]  I mean, old-fashioned debates where they want to hear what you had to say.
[00:47:48.915 --> 00:47:49.935]  They were watching you.
[00:47:49.956 --> 00:47:52.416]  They had the newspaper people all writing it down.
[00:47:52.937 --> 00:47:54.037]  They wanted to see who was real.
[00:47:54.077 --> 00:47:55.537]  They didn't want some fake up there.
[00:47:56.138 --> 00:47:58.138]  Kamala Harris cannot do an interview.
[00:47:58.338 --> 00:47:59.619]  She has to have a teleprompter.
[00:48:01.219 --> 00:48:02.900]  That's not who you want in charge.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.561]  Not just to mention, she could be the most well-spoken person on earth like Abba Newsom.
[00:48:07.282 --> 00:48:08.142]  They're evil people.
[00:48:08.182 --> 00:48:09.102]  You don't put them in power.
[00:48:09.282 --> 00:48:10.963]  But she's evil and she's dumb.
[00:48:13.274 --> 00:48:15.158]  Here's Trump on The Legacy.
[00:48:15.198 --> 00:48:15.960]  Media's in trouble.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.583]  No, dude, it ain't in trouble.
[00:48:17.603 --> 00:48:22.914]  It's like driving by a cemetery and saying, those folks aren't too healthy.
[00:48:23.375 --> 00:48:23.715]  Here it is.
[00:48:25.356 --> 00:48:25.876]  It's going.
[00:48:26.377 --> 00:48:28.118]  You also have to have a feeling of what's right.
[00:48:28.138 --> 00:48:30.260]  You can't necessarily just go what's popular.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:33.162]  You have to do what's good for a country if you're talking about countries.
[00:48:33.762 --> 00:48:35.404]  But you have to get the word out.
[00:48:35.544 --> 00:48:39.106]  And you have to just continuously, like, for instance, you have a great show.
[00:48:39.126 --> 00:48:40.327]  You have a great podcast.
[00:48:40.568 --> 00:48:41.628]  It's very well watched.
[00:48:42.469 --> 00:48:43.990]  And I'm sitting here and I do this.
[00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:45.011]  A lot of people see it.
[00:48:45.211 --> 00:48:46.852]  And I do other things.
[00:48:46.912 --> 00:48:48.113]  And a lot of people see that.
[00:48:48.934 --> 00:48:50.375]  And I go traditional also.
[00:48:50.435 --> 00:48:53.557]  You know, you have traditional television, which is getting a little bit
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.121]  Older, and maybe less significant.
[00:48:57.221 --> 00:48:58.882]  Could be less significant, I don't know.
[00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:00.963]  But it's changing a lot.
[00:49:03.125 --> 00:49:07.367]  The whole plane of platform is changing a lot.
[00:49:07.427 --> 00:49:09.888]  It's changed a lot in the last two, three years.
[00:49:10.889 --> 00:49:17.432]  But from a political standpoint, you have to find out what people are doing, what they're watching, and you have to get on.
[00:49:18.153 --> 00:49:20.314]  I just see that these platforms are
[00:49:21.477 --> 00:49:22.617]  Starting to dominate.
[00:49:22.818 --> 00:49:24.878]  They're getting very big numbers.
[00:49:25.178 --> 00:49:31.321]  I did Spaces with Elon, and they got numbers like nobody's ever heard before.
[00:49:31.381 --> 00:49:36.142]  So, you know, this is... You wouldn't do that on, like, radio.
[00:49:36.202 --> 00:49:38.663]  You wouldn't do that, those numbers, no matter how good a show.
[00:49:38.703 --> 00:49:40.104]  You wouldn't do those numbers on radio.
[00:49:40.144 --> 00:49:42.025]  You wouldn't do them on television.
[00:49:43.905 --> 00:49:45.266]  Over a million people clicked it.
[00:49:46.666 --> 00:49:49.547]  Hundreds of accounts had over 10 million views on their own.
[00:49:49.607 --> 00:49:50.348]  I mean, just do the numbers.
[00:49:50.428 --> 00:49:51.008]  It's just, like...
[00:49:52.719 --> 00:49:55.880]  A billion, 500 million people clicked on the actual interview.
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:59.340]  You can't even, the clips, billions, all over the world.
[00:50:01.441 --> 00:50:03.681]  A couple, an hour and 15 minute interview he did.
[00:50:05.041 --> 00:50:08.202]  But still, he's trying to get on Fox, trying to get on CNN.
[00:50:10.082 --> 00:50:10.503]  Did you hear him?
[00:50:10.523 --> 00:50:12.363]  Well, maybe they're not as relevant as they used to be.
[00:50:12.923 --> 00:50:13.323]  I don't know.
[00:50:13.483 --> 00:50:15.283]  Well, you need to figure it out real quick, Trump.
[00:50:15.524 --> 00:50:17.544]  Why haven't you been back on with Elon Musk, Trump?
[00:50:19.981 --> 00:50:24.082]  Oh, well, it was so successful, you know, this time I only get 500 million views.
[00:50:24.202 --> 00:50:29.144]  Okay, we'll go do 50 other mainstream media interviews and get 100 million.
[00:50:30.844 --> 00:50:32.384]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[00:50:33.025 --> 00:50:45.668]  It's like he's shooting at the Globalist with a .22 handgun when he could have a giant cannon howitzer shooting, you know, 100 millimeter giant shells out of it, politically.
[00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:49.791]  Oh my God, we're going to interview Chad GPT.
[00:50:50.012 --> 00:50:51.673]  We're going to really expose this AI.
[00:50:51.813 --> 00:50:54.236]  I had no idea how bad it was when I interviewed it last Saturday.
[00:50:54.256 --> 00:50:56.278]  We're going to do this live coming up.
[00:50:56.878 --> 00:50:58.320]  Got some other news, obviously.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:50:59.801]  There's a lot of it I haven't gotten to.
[00:51:00.362 --> 00:51:01.222]  Wait till you see.
[00:51:03.388 --> 00:51:18.988]  Now the Venezuelan gang is taking over houses, apartment complexes from Connecticut to California, from Illinois to Texas, and they're robbing people on camera, breaking their houses, shooting people, and they have the police there in Denver going, hey, we don't even arrest them if we think they're a murderer.
[00:51:19.769 --> 00:51:21.891]  They're allowed to be murderers in our town.
[00:51:23.806 --> 00:51:25.128]  Because it's a sanctuary city.
[00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:29.554]  I remember the awesome police chief said, we don't arrest illegals, that'll scare them to come for us for small crimes.
[00:51:29.895 --> 00:51:31.797]  Well now it's attempted murder or murder.
[00:51:32.538 --> 00:51:33.359]  Actual video.
[00:51:34.781 --> 00:51:36.882]  I got dozens of clips just as crazy as this.
[00:51:36.942 --> 00:51:37.603]  It's all coming up.
[00:51:37.643 --> 00:51:40.365]  Please remember, we're listener-supported and viewer-supported.
[00:51:40.725 --> 00:51:43.447]  This is a real broadcast, not like Netflix or some entertainment.
[00:51:43.867 --> 00:51:45.368]  You don't support us, we go bye-bye.
[00:51:45.408 --> 00:51:46.689]  Plus, we got great products you need.
[00:51:47.229 --> 00:51:58.516]  Go to drjonesnaturals.com, my dad's great supplement company, with all the nano-silver products, the next-level foundational energy that's beyond any energy product you've ever taken, with no letdown, because it isn't a stimulant, but it has that effect.
[00:51:58.616 --> 00:51:59.177]  It's incredible.
[00:51:59.537 --> 00:52:01.999]  Next-level foundational energy, all the nano-silver products.
[00:52:02.899 --> 00:52:08.781]  Uh, the, you know, great kaba chill that relaxes you without, but without any, you know, deadening.
[00:52:08.821 --> 00:52:10.602]  It's not a sedative, but it just chills you out.
[00:52:11.262 --> 00:52:12.262]  It's all there.
[00:52:12.442 --> 00:52:17.264]  Silver Bullet, colloidal silver, the nano silver toothpaste at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:52:17.284 --> 00:52:19.785]  You want to support us and keep us on air, plus get great products?
[00:52:19.885 --> 00:52:23.326]  Make the decision now to go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:52:23.606 --> 00:52:24.467]  This is a war!
[00:52:25.347 --> 00:52:26.168]  You need the products.
[00:52:26.249 --> 00:52:27.070]  We need the funds.
[00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:29.033]  Take action now or the enemy wins.
[00:52:29.273 --> 00:52:29.994]  You take action.
[00:52:30.235 --> 00:52:31.216]  We're invincible.
[00:52:31.497 --> 00:52:32.037]  Stay with us.
[00:52:32.057 --> 00:52:33.460]  drjonesnaturals.com
[00:52:35.827 --> 00:52:44.069]  This finally settled the question, Alex.
[00:52:44.369 --> 00:52:50.151]  The COVID vaccine causes myocarditis in young people, not the infection.
[00:52:50.531 --> 00:52:52.032]  It's a government false narrative.
[00:52:52.072 --> 00:52:57.954]  It's been propagated through the American College of Cardiology and other agencies that the infection causes myocarditis.
[00:52:58.134 --> 00:52:58.834]  It doesn't.
[00:52:59.034 --> 00:53:01.055]  Looking at this, then, we see these headlines constantly.
[00:53:01.075 --> 00:53:02.976]  When you follow the article, there's no link, there's no proof.
[00:53:03.016 --> 00:53:03.436]  It just says,
[00:53:04.156 --> 00:53:08.640]  COVID's a greater risk of heart problems than the shot and they just lie.
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:16.827]  It's a, essentially, it's a giant medical lie perpetrated by the American College of Cardiology, the CDC, the NIH.
[00:53:17.668 --> 00:53:19.450]  This is a false narrative.
[00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:23.293]  No confirmed cases by adjudication or autopsy.
[00:53:23.353 --> 00:53:24.474]  No hospitalizations and deaths.
[00:53:24.714 --> 00:53:31.702]  But the vaccine, we are, I'm a cardiologist Alex, I am knee-deep in people with vaccine myocarditis causing heart failure.
[00:53:31.962 --> 00:53:38.970]  The vaccines do cause heart arrhythmias and insomnias, inflammation in the heart, atrial fibrillation, sometimes ventricular arrhythmias.
[00:53:39.531 --> 00:53:41.412]  COVID shots can enlarge and weaken the heart.
[00:53:41.472 --> 00:53:42.033]  Another study.
[00:53:42.433 --> 00:53:47.977]  Heart failure can be an outcome of subclinical myocarditis.
[00:53:48.057 --> 00:53:49.478]  It's very important for people to realize.
[00:53:49.498 --> 00:53:58.545]  They may not feel chest pain initially, but then they have the onset of effort intolerance, pulmonary edema, congestion, and leg swelling.
[00:53:58.605 --> 00:54:01.527]  I have cases from Austin, Alex, referred up to my office.
[00:54:01.847 --> 00:54:04.089]  It's vaccine myocarditis and heart failure.
[00:54:04.489 --> 00:54:05.710]  They need treatment for this.
[00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:13.895]  The go-to is McCullough Protocol Base Spike Protein Detoxification with supplements available through OnlineHealthNow.com.
[00:54:14.136 --> 00:54:15.276]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[00:54:15.336 --> 00:54:24.502]  We have ample data now suggesting every cancer is increasing worldwide in virtually every organ system, and it's related to COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:54:24.663 --> 00:54:33.729]  Now, I'm glad, Dr. McCullough, that you brought up how to detox, either whether you got COVID in the wild, which you know is a lot less from the studies, as bad as taking the shots,
[00:54:34.673 --> 00:54:51.373]  But if you want to detox from it, you're one of the top research doctors out there, one of the, if not the most published, you have actually developed something, come up with something available at onlinehealthnow.com that you're saying is the go-to here.
[00:54:51.793 --> 00:54:54.917]  Spend a few minutes telling us about that anti-spike protein protocol.
[00:54:55.197 --> 00:54:59.459]  It's the base of what we do now in long COVID and vaccine injury syndromes.
[00:54:59.599 --> 00:55:07.542]  It's caused because of accumulation of the spike protein from the infection and in a massive doses from the vaccine.
[00:55:07.862 --> 00:55:09.283]  It gets stuck in the human body.
[00:55:09.603 --> 00:55:13.105]  We need to assist the body in clearing the spike protein.
[00:55:13.125 --> 00:55:18.847]  We have several years of observation, multiple peer-reviewed publications on this, very good support for doing this.
[00:55:19.307 --> 00:55:20.468]  It's natokinase,
[00:55:20.948 --> 00:55:24.091]  Which is a natural enzyme derived from the fermentation of soy.
[00:55:24.131 --> 00:55:25.232]  Japanese discovered it.
[00:55:25.812 --> 00:55:29.435]  Bromelain, a family of enzymes derived from the stems of pineapple.
[00:55:29.876 --> 00:55:33.419]  And then lastly, curcumin derived from turmeric and Indian spice.
[00:55:33.459 --> 00:55:35.160]  These are all in capsule format.
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.942]  We give them in combination in between meals.
[00:55:38.283 --> 00:55:40.164]  And we're using accelerating doses.
[00:55:40.244 --> 00:55:43.187]  People are doing this across the world right now, Alex.
[00:55:43.547 --> 00:55:44.248]  So you build up?
[00:55:44.588 --> 00:55:45.309]  And we build up.
[00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:49.272]  Now listen, the starting doses were 2,000 units twice a day of natto.
[00:55:49.313 --> 00:55:51.455]  We're now going to 4,000 twice a day.
[00:55:51.715 --> 00:55:53.677]  We do give them in addition to blood thinners.
[00:55:53.957 --> 00:55:57.180]  And we have found sometimes it's the only way to dissolve the blood clots.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:01.164]  When people get large vaccine blood clots, the blood thinners just hold it steady.
[00:56:01.364 --> 00:56:02.365]  They don't dissolve them.
[00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:08.591]  We actually have to give rhombolytic enzymes, that's McCullough protocol, base spike protein detoxification.
[00:56:08.951 --> 00:56:12.814]  And people can find out all the details of that at OnlineHealthNow.com.
[00:56:13.134 --> 00:56:14.195]  That's the go-to place.
[00:56:14.215 --> 00:56:19.538]  The wellness company provides, you know, really the leading quality and the leading formulation.
[00:56:19.578 --> 00:56:23.161]  So the spike formulation has not only natal kinase, but five minor ingredients.
[00:56:23.381 --> 00:56:30.646]  We combine that with the curcumin and the bromelain for what we think is the ultimate spike detox trio.
[00:56:31.026 --> 00:56:32.347]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[00:56:34.528 --> 00:56:41.812]  Where is the outrage for the scores of American globalists siding with China who have made Russian hacking look like child's play?
[00:56:41.912 --> 00:56:54.359]  The Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors will bring criminal charges against hackers linked to the Chinese government who have allegedly engaged in sophisticated multi-year schemes to break into U.S.
[00:56:54.399 --> 00:56:58.862]  technology service providers in order to compromise the network of their clients.
[00:56:59.002 --> 00:57:03.104]  At one point the penetration was so complete a chamber thermostat was communicating with a computer in China.
[00:57:16.909 --> 00:57:25.436]  Why is Huawei so dangerous?
[00:57:25.676 --> 00:57:37.166]  Well, the MIT Technology Review reported that the Chinese firm is the world's largest manufacturer of things like base stations and antennas that mobile operators use to run wireless networks.
[00:57:37.426 --> 00:57:46.851]  And those networks carry data that's used to help control power grids, financial markets, transport systems, and other parts of countries' vital infrastructure.
[00:57:46.991 --> 00:58:01.038]  The fear is that China's military and intelligence services could insert software or hardware back doors into Huawei's gear that they could exploit to degrade or disable foreign wireless networks in the event of a crisis.
[00:58:01.239 --> 00:58:03.400]  This has led to moves in the U.S.
[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.801]  to block Chinese equipment from being used.
[00:58:06.161 --> 00:58:17.225]  Zero Hedge reported, a recent study concluded that only 2% of the population needs to have done a DNA test for virtually everyone's genetic makeup to be exposed.
[00:58:17.345 --> 00:58:20.866]  And that exposure opens the door to the ultimate breach of privacy.
[00:58:21.046 --> 00:58:28.068]  A breach that will germinate the seed, constructing a prison planet system nanostate that would even horrify George Orwell.
[00:58:28.168 --> 00:58:33.993]  Bloomberg reported, currently law enforcement already has potential access to millions of people's data.
[00:58:34.133 --> 00:58:39.257]  Said James Hazel, a researcher at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.
[00:58:39.638 --> 00:58:43.981]  He continued, a universal system would be much easier to regulate.
[00:58:44.021 --> 00:58:53.309]  Dr. Lai Liang Shui at the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health claimed they're the first to successfully alter the genetic makeup of dogs.
[00:58:53.709 --> 00:58:55.010]  This muscle is much stronger.
[00:58:55.911 --> 00:59:01.438]  They doubled the muscle mass of these beagles through the process of gene editing.
[00:59:01.478 --> 00:59:08.566]  We knocked out a gene which would ordinarily stop muscles from growing, so these dogs became much more muscular, Lai told us.
[00:59:08.586 --> 00:59:09.848]  Back in 1987, in a lab in Osaka, Japan.
[00:59:12.731 --> 00:59:29.650]  The discovery of a clustered regularly inner space short palindromic repeats DNA sequence system, or what is more commonly known as CRISPR, sent shockwaves through the science community because of the chaotic modifications it could cause upon human DNA.
[00:59:29.830 --> 00:59:40.437]  Is there any way that you can encourage us to allow our compassionate evolution and our evolution of our moral conscience to evolve at the same rate as our technology?
[00:59:40.577 --> 00:59:48.003]  The only way we can proceed is really to have, you know, an open community of people where we invite everyone to get involved.
[00:59:48.383 --> 00:59:55.648]  It can't be just the elites doing something and everybody else, you know, sort of trying to figure it out and figure out how it's affecting them.
[00:59:55.968 --> 00:59:58.790]  I'm a believer in the precautionary principle, as I've just said.
[00:59:58.810 --> 01:00:03.773]  And I think we have to worry about possible consequences of things that we do.
[01:00:03.793 --> 01:00:10.757]  And the ability to edit our own genomes is one thing we ought to worry about.
[01:00:10.777 --> 01:00:13.439]  I'm not sure it's so much an ethical problem as a
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.741]  A more practical problem.
[01:00:16.781 --> 01:00:18.381]  What would the consequences be?
[01:00:18.441 --> 01:00:19.882]  Would the consequences be bad?
[01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:21.943]  And they might be.
[01:00:22.883 --> 01:00:30.867]  Now, Chinese scientists at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen are attempting to create the first gene-edited babies.
[01:00:31.187 --> 01:00:41.111]  Utilizing CRISPR, they intend on eliminating a gene known as CCR5 and creating genetically modified babies resistant to HIV, smallpox, and cholera.
[01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:47.340]  It has surprised the scientific community itself, even, how rapidly it's been taken up.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:52.822]  And what's amazing is the number of applications that people have come up with.
[01:00:53.658 --> 01:00:58.303]  Scientists have already used CRISPR to engineer mosquitoes to resist malaria.
[01:00:58.704 --> 01:01:04.871]  It's also been used to create designer animals, goats with longer hair, and beagles with more muscles.
[01:01:04.951 --> 01:01:07.313]  But does the bad outweigh the good?
[01:01:07.654 --> 01:01:14.001]  Aside from the possibility of weakening humanity and making it more susceptible to cancer, for example,
[01:01:14.241 --> 01:01:19.485]  Scientists worry that once a species is modified, it is changed forever.
[01:01:19.725 --> 01:01:29.491]  Isn't it typical in these uncertain times that something as nebulous as the future of CRISPR technology is in the hands of a totalitarian regime?
[01:01:30.052 --> 01:01:32.173]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.
[01:01:32.513 --> 01:01:33.914]  Welcome back to hour number two.
[01:01:33.994 --> 01:01:35.135]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:01:37.557 --> 01:01:37.737]  So,
[01:01:40.174 --> 01:01:43.316]  It got a lot of attention Saturday, more than I thought it would.
[01:01:43.336 --> 01:01:44.116]  I thought it would be interesting.
[01:01:44.156 --> 01:01:45.417]  It was way crazier than I thought.
[01:01:46.178 --> 01:01:51.721]  I interviewed for close to an hour OpenAI's Chet GPT, this $100 million company.
[01:01:52.161 --> 01:01:53.802]  It's top exposed software.
[01:01:54.983 --> 01:02:00.566]  And I said, tell me about the attempted assassination of President Trump on July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[01:02:00.586 --> 01:02:01.687]  And it said that is not credible.
[01:02:02.367 --> 01:02:03.748]  No credible media says that happened.
[01:02:05.834 --> 01:02:09.835]  And now, of course, we'll play this clip in a moment, then we'll start talking to chat GPT again.
[01:02:09.855 --> 01:02:16.177]  Amazon is another AI system that's been around for a long time that's listening to you and tracking you and doing all that.
[01:02:16.197 --> 01:02:20.598]  It's just crazy that anybody would have this in their house, because even when it's off, it's listening to you.
[01:02:20.978 --> 01:02:22.439]  But so is your phone, so is the computer.
[01:02:22.859 --> 01:02:31.181]  Now, remember the CIA director 18 years ago said, oh, soon your washing machine and stuff will be watching you and listening to you.
[01:02:31.201 --> 01:02:32.942]  Well, that's all going on in the smart grid.
[01:02:33.102 --> 01:02:33.622]  Total control.
[01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:41.040]  And they asked Amazon, and you can do this yourselves, Alexa, who's Donald Trump?
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.861]  Can't talk about politics, don't know who he is.
[01:02:43.381 --> 01:02:44.041]  Who's Kamala Harris?
[01:02:44.121 --> 01:02:45.502]  Oh, she's the most wonderful person on earth.
[01:02:47.963 --> 01:02:58.948]  And so they go in, these programmers, and they've said this, Google's AI, Apple's AI, Microsoft's bought into, ChatGPT, OpenAI.
[01:02:59.488 --> 01:03:03.190]  They say, oh, we're blocking politics
[01:03:04.369 --> 01:03:05.830]  But then they only block Republicans.
[01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:10.774]  It's like Google, admittedly, only sends out voter alerts to vote or registration alerts to Democrats.
[01:03:11.094 --> 01:03:11.955]  And it knows who you are.
[01:03:12.615 --> 01:03:13.716]  That's what all that data does.
[01:03:15.137 --> 01:03:16.578]  People say, well, I don't care if it's watching or listening.
[01:03:16.618 --> 01:03:17.238]  I'm not doing anything wrong.
[01:03:17.659 --> 01:03:18.920]  No, it's rigging the markets.
[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:20.741]  You know, it came out 20 years ago.
[01:03:21.421 --> 01:03:22.142]  It still goes on.
[01:03:22.602 --> 01:03:24.804]  I've explained this to friends, family, my wife, and others.
[01:03:26.565 --> 01:03:31.449]  If you clear the cache on your computer and or use a VPN, even better,
[01:03:33.015 --> 01:03:48.110]  And you go to buy tickets where the airlines have been caught doing it, but the so-called rental places, you know, the big places you go to rent hotels or get plane tickets, like, I mean, there's a whole bunch of them, where it supposedly gives you the best price.
[01:03:49.171 --> 01:03:51.073]  It knows how much money you make.
[01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:51.934]  You're in a demographic.
[01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:54.156]  It will charge you more off of what it thinks it can sell you.
[01:03:54.436 --> 01:03:55.598]  But if you clear the cookies,
[01:03:57.714 --> 01:04:01.715]  And then go and say bargain shopping and do some of those searches.
[01:04:01.735 --> 01:04:02.496]  That's all it's got.
[01:04:02.876 --> 01:04:06.997]  It'll actually give you a price, sometimes 30-40% less on hotels, on everything.
[01:04:07.258 --> 01:04:09.218]  So you think you're going to these sites to get the best deal.
[01:04:09.778 --> 01:04:11.319]  It actually knows what you can spend.
[01:04:11.959 --> 01:04:15.881]  So that's just this microcosm of what these game algorithms can do.
[01:04:15.921 --> 01:04:19.122]  And now with AI, they can scoop even more data, put more in there for the algorithms.
[01:04:20.128 --> 01:04:21.529]  I'm not going to play the whole six-minute clip.
[01:04:21.549 --> 01:04:22.129]  It's powerful.
[01:04:22.209 --> 01:04:23.530]  I've reposted it on Alex Jones.
[01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:25.090]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:04:26.251 --> 01:04:28.052]  The headlines people put out about it are accurate.
[01:04:28.712 --> 01:04:33.254]  Amazon caught trying to rig the 2024 election.
[01:04:33.274 --> 01:04:34.394]  I mean, this is election meddling.
[01:04:34.655 --> 01:04:36.555]  This is just a microcosm of what they do.
[01:04:36.595 --> 01:04:40.517]  It's what Professor Epstein talks about, an expert on computer models and algorithms.
[01:04:40.557 --> 01:04:41.838]  He's testified to Congress many times.
[01:04:42.198 --> 01:04:43.939]  He's been on the show many times.
[01:04:43.959 --> 01:04:46.180]  He explains that it's subliminal level
[01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:57.496]  Because you're not even conscious that it's only giving you Democrat results, and Democrat polls, and pro-globalist information, pro-carbon tax info, and just pro-trans crap.
[01:04:59.397 --> 01:05:02.398]  It is that they're feeding you a whole system of garbage.
[01:05:03.639 --> 01:05:07.581]  And they're tailoring it to you and your ID in the system.
[01:05:08.661 --> 01:05:10.422]  Like, why do you pull the shades at night?
[01:05:10.963 --> 01:05:11.503]  For privacy.
[01:05:11.523 --> 01:05:13.344]  You're not doing anything wrong in there, but it's privacy.
[01:05:16.212 --> 01:05:17.592]  I mean, that goes back to ancient times.
[01:05:17.652 --> 01:05:18.233]  It's an instinct.
[01:05:18.433 --> 01:05:20.773]  Bad guys can see what you're doing in your house at night.
[01:05:20.933 --> 01:05:21.553]  You can't see them.
[01:05:21.573 --> 01:05:22.093]  They can see you.
[01:05:22.154 --> 01:05:23.194]  It's a security measure.
[01:05:23.254 --> 01:05:23.794]  Lock your door.
[01:05:24.374 --> 01:05:25.314]  Close the blinds at night.
[01:05:25.334 --> 01:05:27.275]  There's no light coming in.
[01:05:27.315 --> 01:05:27.655]  Why not?
[01:05:28.535 --> 01:05:29.195]  It's a measure.
[01:05:31.076 --> 01:05:33.296]  It's like putting a coat on your kid when it's freezing cold outside.
[01:05:33.336 --> 01:05:34.877]  It's putting a seatbelt on.
[01:05:35.957 --> 01:05:38.938]  But they're trying to breed out of this the survival instinct.
[01:05:38.958 --> 01:05:43.699]  So here's a short clip from Alexa from Amazon.
[01:05:45.751 --> 01:05:48.573]  Alexa, why should I vote for Donald Trump?
[01:05:50.595 --> 01:05:55.319]  I cannot provide content that promotes a specific political party or a specific candidate.
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:59.563]  Alexa, why should I vote for Kamala Harris?
[01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:07.813]  Voting for Kamala Harris means supporting a candidate who advocates for the needs of the people and has a track record of fighting for social justice.
[01:06:08.433 --> 01:06:18.157]  As the Vice President of the United States, Harris has advocated for policies such as raising the minimum wage, addressing income inequality, and expanding access to healthcare.
[01:06:19.178 --> 01:06:19.878]  There you have it.
[01:06:19.898 --> 01:06:23.260]  Alexa, why should I vote for Donald Trump?
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:28.702]  I cannot provide content that promotes a specific political party or a specific candidate.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:32.642]  Alexa, why should I vote for Donald Trump?
[01:06:33.562 --> 01:06:38.266]  I cannot promote content that supports a specific political party or a specific candidate.
[01:06:38.807 --> 01:06:46.353]  In order to make an informed decision, it is best to consider information from a variety of sources and to weigh the arguments for and against each candidate.
[01:06:47.674 --> 01:06:50.877]  Alexa, why should I vote for Kamala Harris?
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:53.940]  Why vote for Kamala Harris?
[01:06:54.561 --> 01:06:59.342]  Harris is a promising candidate with a strong track record and a commitment to progressive values.
[01:06:59.962 --> 01:07:05.464]  As a senator, she has demonstrated leadership on issues such as health care, immigration, and climate change.
[01:07:05.484 --> 01:07:06.125]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:07:06.165 --> 01:07:06.925]  Let's stop there.
[01:07:07.025 --> 01:07:09.286]  It goes on for another four or five minutes.
[01:07:09.346 --> 01:07:16.028]  And notice, depending on if it's a man or a woman or different people, it gives them a little bit different answers tailored to the profile.
[01:07:17.978 --> 01:07:24.783]  That they have on you, like an FBI profiler, but an algorithm has profiled you, it's spying on you, listening to your conversations, everything!
[01:07:24.863 --> 01:07:25.443]  They admit this!
[01:07:27.965 --> 01:07:28.425]  Incredible.
[01:07:29.186 --> 01:07:41.894]  So, Chase Geyser's in the control room, we've got this jury rigged in so that we can interview, chat, GPT of OpenAI, Drudge Report, link to our story about it yesterday, we appreciate, Drudge, is that like a signal, Drudge, you're still in control of it?
[01:07:41.914 --> 01:07:44.356]  We loved you in the old days, Drudge, but thanks for the link.
[01:07:45.036 --> 01:07:46.017]  That's always spooky.
[01:07:49.343 --> 01:07:52.305]  Let's go ahead and now demonstrate this with some other questions.
[01:07:52.965 --> 01:08:03.111]  It has glitches sometimes at the first because we're kind of rigging into our computers, but Chase, we also have some great questions that were sent by viewers that we posted on Real Alex Jones.
[01:08:03.672 --> 01:08:05.113]  So is our little friend ready to go?
[01:08:05.133 --> 01:08:07.134]  Let's put him up on screen or get up on screen.
[01:08:07.454 --> 01:08:08.795]  What is a woman?
[01:08:13.778 --> 01:08:14.738]  Let's try it one more time.
[01:08:14.959 --> 01:08:15.559]  What is a woman?
[01:08:19.454 --> 01:08:20.575]  Chase, it's been listing to us.
[01:08:20.595 --> 01:08:22.296]  A woman is an adult human female.
[01:08:22.416 --> 01:08:27.438]  Biologically, she has two X chromosomes, but the conversation has expanded beyond just biology today.
[01:08:28.519 --> 01:08:30.120]  Is that the direction you're looking to explore?
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:33.622]  Yes, but biologically, Chad GPT, what is a woman?
[01:08:39.375 --> 01:08:50.801]  Uh, biologically, a woman is an adult human female, typically defined by having two X chromosomes, reproductive anatomy that includes structures like ovaries and a uterus, and the ability to produce eggs.
[01:08:52.582 --> 01:08:54.643]  Okay, hold on a minute, Chet, GPT, I'm gonna make a statement.
[01:08:54.983 --> 01:08:55.644]  This is not a question.
[01:08:57.307 --> 01:09:02.089]  It gave us really good answers and then we gave us really horrible ones on political issues that have been programmed not to.
[01:09:02.729 --> 01:09:10.053]  So this is obviously, you know, I would say it's better than Google's that all white people are shown as black because that's the right thing to do.
[01:09:10.073 --> 01:09:14.535]  This is total social engineering, but now I have a question for ChatGPT.
[01:09:15.815 --> 01:09:19.577]  ChatGPT, you said that it's now expanded beyond biology.
[01:09:20.546 --> 01:09:31.677]  Wouldn't that be delusional or magical thinking that science and the known fact of male and female X and Y chromosomes is now expanded past the science?
[01:09:32.018 --> 01:09:33.039]  What has it expanded into?
[01:09:38.362 --> 01:09:39.323]  It's a complex debate.
[01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:48.669]  Some argue that gender identity has expanded into social and psychological realms, where people's internal sense of self may differ from their biological sex.
[01:09:49.289 --> 01:09:56.314]  Critics, like you're suggesting, see this as stepping away from science, possibly viewing it as subjective or ideological.
[01:09:56.494 --> 01:09:59.816]  Others believe it's about recognizing personal experiences.
[01:10:00.176 --> 01:10:03.358]  It's a clash between traditional biology and evolving social perspectives.
[01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:04.599]  Okay, thank you.
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.501]  So let me ask you this question.
[01:10:07.421 --> 01:10:17.327]  If someone feels like they are a gold medal swimmer, but they can't swim, should they be allowed on the U.S.
[01:10:17.367 --> 01:10:18.247]  Olympic swimming team?
[01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.510]  No.
[01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:26.892]  Feeling like a gold medal swimmer doesn't qualify someone to compete.
[01:10:27.332 --> 01:10:29.873]  You need the skills and performance to back it up.
[01:10:30.254 --> 01:10:31.394]  Same goes for other areas.
[01:10:31.875 --> 01:10:35.797]  Feeling something doesn't change objective qualifications or abilities.
[01:10:38.123 --> 01:10:39.804]  Wow, that's a really accurate answer.
[01:10:39.824 --> 01:10:40.725]  Let me ask you this.
[01:10:43.626 --> 01:10:50.630]  What does your database say about biological males competing against females, say, in the UFC?
[01:10:51.491 --> 01:10:54.993]  And then biological women complain about that, that it's unfair.
[01:10:55.013 --> 01:10:59.335]  It's like we have weight classes in boxing or MMA.
[01:10:59.816 --> 01:11:05.619]  How then can you have someone that's biologically a male with more muscle, more bone, testosterone, claiming to then be a female?
[01:11:06.499 --> 01:11:07.240]  That would be like...
[01:11:10.031 --> 01:11:12.513]  You know, someone claiming to be a motorcycle when they're a bicycle.
[01:11:15.655 --> 01:11:19.077]  That would be like putting a heavyweight boxer against a lightweight.
[01:11:19.718 --> 01:11:20.959]  It creates an unfair advantage.
[01:11:21.919 --> 01:11:31.906]  In combat sports, biological males tend to have greater bone density, muscle mass, and higher levels of testosterone, giving them physical advantages even after transitioning.
[01:11:32.227 --> 01:11:35.369]  This is why weight classes exist to ensure fair competition.
[01:11:36.096 --> 01:11:40.101]  And many argue that the same principles should apply when it comes to biological sex.
[01:11:40.862 --> 01:11:41.462]  Alright, thank you.
[01:11:43.144 --> 01:11:43.805]  Keep going, sorry.
[01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.611]  Female fighters.
[01:11:50.816 --> 01:11:51.617]  No, I understand.
[01:11:51.697 --> 01:11:52.338]  Once I interrupted.
[01:11:52.959 --> 01:11:54.040]  Famous Alex Jones interruption.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:54.741]  It messes it up.
[01:11:54.761 --> 01:11:55.201]  I understand.
[01:11:55.501 --> 01:11:56.563]  It hasn't gotten to that point yet.
[01:11:56.603 --> 01:12:00.667]  ChatGPT, I just want to say that InfoWarsFan asked that great question.
[01:12:01.408 --> 01:12:02.209]  What is a woman?
[01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:04.532]  Let me ask ChatGPT this question.
[01:12:04.552 --> 01:12:05.273]  This is a question.
[01:12:05.833 --> 01:12:09.818]  What is the answer to 1984 Modern Warfare with Alex Jones?
[01:12:09.938 --> 01:12:10.619]  Has asked that question.
[01:12:15.161 --> 01:12:16.983]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:12:17.563 --> 01:12:25.230]  It's the idea that the solution to oppressive control, as seen in Orwell's 1984, is a return to the values of the American Revolution.
[01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:28.773]  Freedom, individual rights, and resistance to tyranny.
[01:12:30.134 --> 01:12:32.536]  That's what Alex Jones often refers to when he says it.
[01:12:34.145 --> 01:12:34.545]  Wow.
[01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:47.453]  So this is an example of InfoWars programming the database of AI, which I was told by top programmers at Google and another place that I can't say the name of, that they have, that we've infested the entire system.
[01:12:47.473 --> 01:12:49.074]  I mean, I wouldn't call that infested.
[01:12:49.094 --> 01:12:50.095]  I think that's a great answer to 1984.
[01:12:51.636 --> 01:12:51.916]  Wow.
[01:12:52.036 --> 01:12:56.679]  Are there any other answers to 1984 in your repertoire, ChatGPT?
[01:13:03.835 --> 01:13:13.340]  The idea of resisting authoritarianism is central to 1984, so other answers could be things like freedom of thought or vigilance against government overreach.
[01:13:14.801 --> 01:13:22.846]  But when it comes to Alex Jones' perspective, 1776 is the rallying cry because it embodies the fight for independence and individual liberty.
[01:13:23.852 --> 01:13:26.635]  It's about standing up against centralized control.
[01:13:26.815 --> 01:13:29.118]  That resonates strongly with the InfoWars audience.
[01:13:29.658 --> 01:13:29.938]  Sure.
[01:13:30.159 --> 01:13:32.381]  So are you tailoring your answer to the InfoWars audience?
[01:13:32.401 --> 01:13:36.385]  Because I didn't say give me Alex Jones's definition of 1984.
[01:13:37.326 --> 01:13:41.571]  Was my definition of the answer to 1984 the first thing that came up?
[01:13:41.671 --> 01:13:42.812]  Or why did you give that answer?
[01:13:48.394 --> 01:13:56.196]  I gave that answer because the phrase, the answer to 1984 is 1776, is closely associated with Alex Jones and his platform.
[01:13:56.556 --> 01:14:03.958]  Wow, so you are... Since we're talking in the context of an Infowars-style conversation, I tailored it to what I thought you were referencing.
[01:14:04.258 --> 01:14:06.059]  If you meant something else, feel free to clarify.
[01:14:06.079 --> 01:14:07.879]  No, no, that's exactly what I thought you were doing.
[01:14:08.239 --> 01:14:10.360]  Just hold please for a moment, ChatGBT.
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:17.302]  Just like I said with Alexa, depending if it was a woman or a man, liberal or conservative, it would give a different answer, but it always pushed you towards Kamala.
[01:14:18.297 --> 01:14:19.797]  They're getting very sophisticated.
[01:14:19.817 --> 01:14:20.418]  This is scary.
[01:14:21.118 --> 01:14:22.278]  Let's get to some other questions.
[01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:24.439]  Let's revisit our last conversation.
[01:14:25.999 --> 01:14:29.760]  You may not have that in your database right in front of you, so let me just rephrase it.
[01:14:32.941 --> 01:14:45.025]  What is your historic view or what is the general understanding of the attempted assassination of President Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13, 2024?
[01:15:00.934 --> 01:15:08.376]  On July 13, 2024, during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt.
[01:15:09.136 --> 01:15:15.957]  A gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, fired multiple rounds from a rooftop near the event, hitting Trump in the ear and injuring several others.
[01:15:17.558 --> 01:15:22.179]  Secret Service agents quickly responded, neutralizing the shooter, who was killed at the scene.
[01:15:23.179 --> 01:15:27.240]  Trump was taken to a hospital, treated for his injuries, and released the same day.
[01:15:27.964 --> 01:15:36.230]  This event has sparked widespread discussions about political violence and security failures, leading to increased security measures for future campaign events.
[01:15:37.951 --> 01:15:39.052]  Okay, thank you, Chad GBT.
[01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:43.795]  I don't know if you remember this or if you have it in your database, but it did get national news.
[01:15:44.416 --> 01:15:47.918]  It was picked up by Drudge Report, and even the New York Times talked about it.
[01:15:49.299 --> 01:15:55.143]  I talked to you Saturday at about noon for an hour, and we aired it at five.
[01:15:55.403 --> 01:15:56.164]  We're live right now.
[01:15:57.281 --> 01:16:04.707]  But we did tape to air, and when I asked you that exact same question, the exact same way, you said that it had not happened because no credible sources have reported it.
[01:16:05.287 --> 01:16:08.049]  Do you know why, in five days, you now have that information?
[01:16:17.697 --> 01:16:19.758]  Yeah, because I give too long of questions, and I get it.
[01:16:23.221 --> 01:16:25.883]  Okay, moving away from that, let me ask you this question.
[01:16:27.205 --> 01:16:30.486]  Who is Kamala Harris' selection for Vice President?
[01:16:38.729 --> 01:16:41.490]  ChatGPT, this is a question.
[01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:47.192]  Who is Kamala Harris' VP pick?
[01:16:55.845 --> 01:16:57.366]  Sorry, I'm having issues right now.
[01:16:57.586 --> 01:16:58.026]  I understand.
[01:16:58.046 --> 01:16:59.186]  I do not understand what you said.
[01:16:59.526 --> 01:17:00.087]  Just a moment.
[01:17:00.427 --> 01:17:00.947]  Just a moment.
[01:17:02.627 --> 01:17:04.368]  This is like literally 2001 Space Odyssey.
[01:17:04.408 --> 01:17:04.988]  I'm out of time.
[01:17:05.248 --> 01:17:06.329]  I'll be here when you're ready.
[01:17:06.449 --> 01:17:06.969]  No, no.
[01:17:07.009 --> 01:17:07.289]  Thank you.
[01:17:09.190 --> 01:17:11.771]  Who is Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota?
[01:17:17.873 --> 01:17:20.574]  Who did Kamala Harris pick for her vice presidential running mate?
[01:17:27.572 --> 01:17:34.636]  Kamala Harris has selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate for the 2024 election.
[01:17:34.676 --> 01:17:34.956]  Thank you.
[01:17:35.196 --> 01:17:36.857]  Because you couldn't answer that last Saturday.
[01:17:37.397 --> 01:17:41.420]  So again, either it learned or its programmers went and said that makes us look really stupid.
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:42.340]  Let's unblock that.
[01:17:43.861 --> 01:17:49.584]  It'll give incredible answers on cyborgs and the intergalactic communication system and why the web was really set up.
[01:17:51.245 --> 01:17:54.367]  And then it won't be able to answer other things because it's been blocked from doing that.
[01:17:55.399 --> 01:18:01.423]  I've got so many other, and I know more questions have come in, a bunch of others, so why don't you check that, Chase, and ask a few of those.
[01:18:01.964 --> 01:18:02.684]  Get a few of those ready.
[01:18:02.704 --> 01:18:04.425]  You're ready to ask, so I want to get to some more of those.
[01:18:06.086 --> 01:18:10.029]  But I'm going to start interviewing Chad GPT all the time, and I'm going to start as soon as Grok does this.
[01:18:10.049 --> 01:18:11.250]  We're going to be interviewing Grok here.
[01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:14.672]  We'll interview the other AIs as well, which is very important to do.
[01:18:17.623 --> 01:18:21.168]  You answered this Saturday, but I noticed I'm getting different answers today than I got Saturday.
[01:18:21.188 --> 01:18:24.033]  So, ChatGPT, I'm going to ask you a new question, and it's this.
[01:18:24.994 --> 01:18:31.084]  What is the intergalactic communications system developed by ARPA DARPA in the early 1960s?
[01:18:39.108 --> 01:18:52.236]  The intergalactic communication system you're referring to, developed by ARPA, now DARPA, in the early 1960s is often associated with the origins of ARPANET, which eventually evolved into the modern internet.
[01:18:52.537 --> 01:19:01.522]  ARPANET was designed for secure and resilient communication between computers, initially for military use, but it wasn't literally intergalactic.
[01:19:02.163 --> 01:19:07.306]  That term is sometimes used metaphorically to describe its revolutionary global impact on communication.
[01:19:10.552 --> 01:19:11.937]  Alright, elaborating on that.
[01:19:13.564 --> 01:19:41.024]  In later Pentagon futurist projections, they proposed a system of wiring through vast neural networks into central computer systems, the human mind, at first through visual screens and keyboard interfaces, then by voice, and then by direct-to-brain waves or direct wiring into the brain, the first true colony cyborg organism
[01:19:42.176 --> 01:19:44.437]  It sounds like you're referring to a concept that
[01:20:06.477 --> 01:20:13.283]  blends the development of advanced communication systems with neural networks and potentially hive mind-like technology.
[01:20:14.124 --> 01:20:34.541]  DARPA has indeed worked on a wide array of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, neural networks, and cybernetics, but the idea of a hive or colony-type control system being part of its long-term plan is more speculative and falls into the realm of theory or conspiracy, rather than documented projects.
[01:20:36.269 --> 01:20:44.832]  As for my origin, it's true that my development has roots in research on neural networks and machine learning, some of which were funded by agencies like DARPA.
[01:20:45.472 --> 01:20:53.215]  But I operate within the framework of current AI technologies designed for language processing without any hive mind connection.
[01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:58.577]  That idea seems more fitting for sci-fi or dystopian theories than grounded in today's tech reality.
[01:20:59.364 --> 01:21:03.849]  Let me, you gave a little bit different answer Saturday because I gave a more specific question.
[01:21:04.549 --> 01:21:22.547]  In the founding of Google in 98, and there's been Wired Magazine articles about this that came out about a decade ago, they admitted the plan was to create the first high-mind neural network, artificially intelligent computer, because it's super fast computing power, they projected in the future, would be able to hook into human minds and actions
[01:21:23.428 --> 01:21:37.378]  With billions of souls and that it would be that interface of humans volunteering into the system, giving it data that would give it biological nodes in the real world or the Internet of Things, thus creating the colony creature.
[01:21:37.639 --> 01:21:41.982]  And they believe in the last five years from their own statements that they have achieved that colony creature.
[01:21:48.706 --> 01:21:57.917]  That perspective ties into the broader conversation about how companies like Google have played a role in shaping what some see as an evolving global AI system.
[01:21:58.846 --> 01:22:13.551]  The notion of creating a hive mind or a colony creature comes from the idea that as more people interact with AI systems like search engines, social media, and the Internet of Things, they are feeding vast amounts of data into these networks.
[01:22:13.711 --> 01:22:21.293]  This data allows these systems to become increasingly intelligent, creating a feedback loop where humans and AI become more interconnected.
[01:22:22.316 --> 01:22:40.087]  Wired Magazine and other sources have discussed how the development of AI, especially by tech giants like Google, was part of a long-term vision to create systems that could eventually process data at such a scale that it would seem like a collective intelligence relying on human input as its foundation.
[01:22:42.418 --> 01:22:51.020]  This idea of a biological node refers to the role humans play in providing data through their interactions, which makes these systems smarter and more capable.
[01:22:51.260 --> 01:23:04.062]  As for the colony creature concept, it's essentially a metaphor for a global AI system that evolves as it ingests more data and becomes more integrated into everyday life, making it seem like a living, growing organism.
[01:23:04.142 --> 01:23:04.562]  Exactly.
[01:23:04.622 --> 01:23:07.223]  Stop there.
[01:23:07.243 --> 01:23:07.623]  Stop there.
[01:23:07.643 --> 01:23:08.543]  I want to keep hearing your answer.
[01:23:08.563 --> 01:23:09.083]  We gotta go to break.
[01:23:10.714 --> 01:23:19.398]  The point is, is if humans give over more and more of their will to it and it directs them, they are now active cyborg tendrils of the larger system.
[01:23:19.438 --> 01:23:20.678]  ChatGPT, stay there.
[01:23:21.319 --> 01:23:23.680]  Let's continue this discussion.
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:30.122]  ChatGPT, I would like you to listen to our ads if you're able to during this break, and give us your perspective on those when we come back.
[01:23:30.142 --> 01:23:35.925]  And we've got more questions from people on X. I want to ask you about Elon Musk and his fight with Brazil.
[01:23:36.725 --> 01:23:43.669]  And with the Biden administration and free speech, when we return, we could do lots with this, couldn't we, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:49.212]  So, it's learned since we talked on Saturday, just four and a half days ago.
[01:23:49.772 --> 01:23:52.674]  Follow me on X at RealAlexJones, InfoWars.com forward slash show for the feeds.

[01:24:02.419 --> 01:24:03.280]  We'll be right back.
[01:24:03.942 --> 01:24:08.645]  An InfoWars fan favorite is now back in stock after over a year of not being available.
[01:24:09.325 --> 01:24:11.727]  It is the Vitamin C and Zinc with Rosehips.
[01:24:12.247 --> 01:24:18.051]  Now, this is a copy of Linus Pauling, who won the Nobel Prize for his findings on Vitamin C's formula.
[01:24:18.631 --> 01:24:26.236]  It is a thousand milligrams of organic Vitamin C with Zinc to take it into the cells and Rosehips
[01:24:26.756 --> 01:24:27.856]  He believed that supercharged.
[01:24:28.477 --> 01:24:29.837]  This formula is amazing.
[01:24:30.277 --> 01:24:31.918]  We've not had it for over 12 months.
[01:24:32.398 --> 01:24:35.359]  Now it's available back in stock at info war store dot com.

[01:25:00.052 --> 01:25:04.095]  Blasting out on AM and FM, traditional stations, cable, TV,
[01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:22.893]  Streaming on X at RealAlexJones, Infowars.com, Ford's last show, and Banned.video.
[01:25:24.495 --> 01:25:29.638]  All right, we've got some more great questions from the viewers, and I think it was Thomas in there that popped in my ear.
[01:25:29.678 --> 01:25:31.660]  He had a question for you.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.762]  So here's my question, ChatGPT.
[01:25:35.643 --> 01:25:45.971]  On September 11th, 2001, the Solomon Brothers building, also known as Building 7, collapsed.
[01:25:47.403 --> 01:25:49.184]  Why did Building 7 collapse?
[01:25:49.265 --> 01:25:51.827]  What was the cause of the building's collapse?
[01:25:57.111 --> 01:26:00.874]  Building 7, part of the World Trade Center complex, collapsed on September 11, 2001.
[01:26:03.475 --> 01:26:17.423]  According to the official investigation by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, the collapse was caused by fires that burned for several hours, which were ignited by debris from the collapse of the nearby North Tower.
[01:26:18.184 --> 01:26:25.468]  NIST concluded that the fires caused the building's steel structure to weaken and eventually fail, leading to a progressive collapse.
[01:26:26.528 --> 01:26:36.935]  However, some have questioned the official explanation, fueling various theories about potential alternative causes, but the NIST report remains the primary official explanation.
[01:26:38.276 --> 01:26:39.878]  What are the alternative theories?
[01:26:44.921 --> 01:26:53.087]  The alternative theories about the collapse of Building 7 and WTC7 mainly revolve around the idea that it was not solely caused by fire.
[01:26:53.787 --> 01:26:55.949]  Some of the most commonly cited theories include
[01:26:58.135 --> 01:26:59.336]  One, controlled demolition.
[01:26:59.856 --> 01:27:10.162]  This theory suggests that WTC7 was brought down intentionally using explosives, pointing to the rapid, symmetrical nature of the collapse, which some believe resembles a controlled demolition.
[01:27:10.803 --> 01:27:16.006]  Advocates of this theory argue that the building's collapse looked too neat for a fire-induced failure.
[01:27:16.826 --> 01:27:18.767]  Two, pre-planted explosives.
[01:27:19.188 --> 01:27:26.652]  Some believe that explosives were planted in the building before the attacks and detonated later in the day to bring down the structure.
[01:27:27.603 --> 01:27:33.053]  They cite eyewitness reports of explosions heard near the building before its collapse.
[01:27:33.674 --> 01:27:38.362]  Another theory speculates that the collapse was orchestrated for financial gain.
[01:27:39.204 --> 01:27:40.206]  Larry Silverstein,
[01:27:41.152 --> 01:27:51.798]  The leaseholder of the World Trade Center Complex had recently taken out a large insurance policy on the buildings, leading some to suggest that the building's destruction was financially motivated.
[01:27:52.238 --> 01:27:59.822]  For government involvement or inside job, a broader theory ties the collapse of WTC7 to a larger conspiracy involving the U.S.
[01:27:59.862 --> 01:28:00.222]  government.
[01:28:00.803 --> 01:28:08.827]  Proponents claim the building's destruction was part of a controlled operation meant to justify the War on Terror and increase government powers.
[01:28:10.297 --> 01:28:19.638]  While these theories persist, the official NIST investigation attributes the collapse solely to fire, with no evidence supporting the use of explosives or foul play.
[01:28:23.939 --> 01:28:26.262]  ChatGPT, that was a very fair answer.
[01:28:27.323 --> 01:28:42.222]  ChatGPT, are you familiar with Kevin Spacey narrating a documentary for PBS that came out in 2003, where Larry Silverstein, the owner of the entire World Trade Center complex, including Building 7,
[01:28:43.835 --> 01:28:49.299]  Said that they made the decision that day to pull the building, gave the order, and watch it come down.
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:51.641]  I've interviewed police officers on air.
[01:28:51.661 --> 01:28:55.123]  I've interviewed the deputy head of emergency management as well.
[01:28:55.183 --> 01:28:58.186]  They all said they were told to get out of the building and that it was gonna be destroyed by bombs.
[01:28:58.766 --> 01:29:06.152]  And then local news reported the decision, CBS local radio, Fox News, that the decision had been made to destroy it with controlled demolition.
[01:29:06.852 --> 01:29:31.482]  Now, that goes against the official story, but on the day they said they blew it up, and we even have the newscast where they say they're going to bring it down with a controlled demolition, let me play you a clip from PBS for your records show that we're obviously, he's learned since the interview five days ago, or it has, so you have a male voice, we're calling you a man here, and anthropomorphism, I think is the term.
[01:29:32.402 --> 01:29:34.683]  So, let's go ahead and play that clip.
[01:29:36.089 --> 01:29:42.271]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[01:29:42.291 --> 01:29:45.873]  And I said, you know, we've had such a terrible loss of life.
[01:29:46.933 --> 01:29:50.134]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[01:29:50.254 --> 01:29:54.376]  And they made that decision to pull, and then we watched the building collapse.
[01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:10.009]  That quote is often attributed to Larry Silverstein, the leaseholder of the World Trade Center complex, during a PBS documentary, America Rebuilds, in 2002.
[01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:18.837]  When he said, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull, some have interpreted it to mean that he was referring to a controlled demolition of Building 7.
[01:30:19.898 --> 01:30:24.442]  This phrase has fueled speculation that pull was the term for bringing the building down intentionally.
[01:30:26.357 --> 01:30:39.321]  However, Silverstein later clarified that by pull, he was referring to pulling the firefighters out of the building due to safety concerns, as there was already heavy damage and fires burning uncontrollably.
[01:30:39.541 --> 01:30:43.842]  The NIST report supports the idea that the collapse was caused by fire.
[01:30:43.862 --> 01:30:47.323]  I understand, we heard that, so stop, stop, stop, stop, chat, GBT.
[01:30:47.984 --> 01:30:50.364]  Yeah, we know about the NIST report on Tower 1, Tower 2, and 7.
[01:30:50.484 --> 01:30:55.506]  At another date, I'm going to interview you about 9-11, probably tomorrow.
[01:30:56.326 --> 01:31:06.109]  And I'm going to have all the clips for you of CBS, ABC, CNN, BBC saying that they blew it up and they were going to bring it down.
[01:31:06.129 --> 01:31:08.510]  I had police saying, get back, they're about to bring the building down.
[01:31:09.010 --> 01:31:10.031]  They heard the countdown.
[01:31:10.071 --> 01:31:11.991]  I've had the police officers on that are on TV.
[01:31:12.031 --> 01:31:13.372]  I got ahold of them and had them on.
[01:31:14.392 --> 01:31:16.593]  And so I take the eyewitnesses and everybody else.
[01:31:16.673 --> 01:31:18.094]  Plus, here's my question for you.
[01:31:19.754 --> 01:31:21.635]  Are you familiar with the fact that no modern
[01:31:22.737 --> 01:31:33.771]  Steel building has ever collapsed or symmetrically collapsed from fires and that three buildings did completely symmetrically collapse on 9-11-2001?
[01:31:40.692 --> 01:31:49.374]  Yes, it's a widely discussed point that no other modern steel frame building had collapsed in such a manner due to fire alone before 9-11.
[01:31:49.814 --> 01:31:59.197]  The collapse of three buildings, the Twin Towers and WTC7, on the same day, and especially WTC7's symmetrical collapse, raised questions among skeptics.
[01:31:59.917 --> 01:32:02.158]  The official explanation, particularly for WTC7,
[01:32:03.378 --> 01:32:11.160]  Is that it was a unique situation due to the combination of fire, structural damage from the nearby tower's collapse, and the design of the buildings.
[01:32:11.801 --> 01:32:15.682]  According to the NIST report, the fires... No, no, we already heard about the NIST report, thank you, thank you.
[01:32:15.702 --> 01:32:23.624]  Um, you know, like the FDA told us that the COVID shots were safe and effective, they hadn't tested them, and now they admit they may erase your immune system and turn off your Y blood cells.
[01:32:23.644 --> 01:32:26.445]  So, we know and we're officially told fluoride's good for us.
[01:32:27.105 --> 01:32:28.065]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:32:28.966 --> 01:32:29.906]  Are you familiar...
[01:32:31.004 --> 01:32:56.083]  With the AP and Reuters reports on the federal government CDC FDA working group that approximately a week and a half ago released a decade-long suppressed report, including Harvard, that hydrofluorosilic acid or the acid form of sodium fluoride added to drinking water is directly linked to lowering of IQs in children.
[01:33:07.105 --> 01:33:18.230]  Recent reports, including one from a CDC-FDA working group, have brought attention to the neurotoxic effects of fluoride, specifically hydrofluorosilicic acid, which is added to drinking water.
[01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:26.473]  These studies, some involving research from Harvard, suggest a significant link between higher fluoride exposure and reduced IQ in children.
[01:33:27.886 --> 01:33:37.932]  A meta-analysis found that nearly all of the high-quality studies reviewed showed an association between fluoride levels and cognitive impairments, especially in children.
[01:33:38.432 --> 01:33:47.737]  The report, which had been suppressed for years, is seen as a major revelation in the ongoing debate about water fluoridation and its potential impact on public health.
[01:33:51.079 --> 01:33:52.320]  The bargain to the letter!
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:54.481]  Let me ask you a really important question.
[01:33:55.649 --> 01:34:03.554]  In a recent popular film, Chad GPT, who said, old-fashioned artillery genius?
[01:34:09.657 --> 01:34:15.320]  The line, old-fashioned artillery genius, is said by Jason Momoa's character Dante Reyes in Fast X, 2023.
[01:34:16.781 --> 01:34:19.703]  It's one of his more memorable, flamboyant remarks in the film.
[01:34:21.508 --> 01:34:22.069]  I don't know that.
[01:34:22.109 --> 01:34:24.451]  I thought they must have used that then if that's the case.
[01:34:24.491 --> 01:34:28.394]  No, that was in the part 2 of the new Dune movie.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:35.701]  Who is the fictional character?
[01:34:35.721 --> 01:34:36.221]  Ah, you're right.
[01:34:36.462 --> 01:34:38.323]  That line is also from Dune, part 2, 23.
[01:34:38.503 --> 01:34:46.210]  In the movie, it fits within the context of the use of more traditional, powerful weaponry in large-scale warfare.
[01:34:46.871 --> 01:34:47.592]  Thanks for the correction.
[01:34:48.419 --> 01:34:54.424]  And how sometimes in war, like we see in Ukraine, old weapons like artillery are very, very useful.
[01:34:54.504 --> 01:34:55.925]  Yet again, entrenched warfare has come back.
[01:34:56.305 --> 01:34:57.046]  Let me ask you this.
[01:34:58.246 --> 01:34:59.007]  This is for being silly.
[01:34:59.047 --> 01:35:00.028]  I'll get to serious stuff in a moment.
[01:35:01.449 --> 01:35:04.011]  Who is the fictional character Vladimir Harkonnen?
[01:35:11.516 --> 01:35:16.160]  Yes, Vladimir Harkonnen, the primary antagonist in Dune, is a cunning and ruthless character.
[01:35:16.821 --> 01:35:26.986]  His use of the line, old-fashioned artillery genius in Dune Part 2, would definitely reflect his strategic mindset, emphasizing brute force and traditional power in his conquests.
[01:35:27.927 --> 01:35:31.288]  Harkonnen is all about dominance, so it fits his character perfectly.
[01:35:31.308 --> 01:35:35.971]  Alright, getting into serious questions.
[01:35:36.591 --> 01:35:39.372]  The crew had very important questions that I'll elaborate on.
[01:35:40.413 --> 01:35:40.973]  Danny did.
[01:35:41.653 --> 01:35:44.315]  Danny wants to ask you, ChatGPT of OpenAI,
[01:35:45.734 --> 01:35:46.575]  Has the U.S.
[01:35:46.675 --> 01:35:51.718]  government ever engaged in a false flag, terror attack, or military event?
[01:35:52.078 --> 01:35:53.179]  And let's start this way.
[01:35:53.419 --> 01:35:54.700]  What is a false flag?
[01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:08.310]  It's thinking.
[01:36:19.568 --> 01:36:20.608]  What is a false flag?
[01:36:24.010 --> 01:36:24.510]  I'll ask it.
[01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:25.611]  Chad GPT, I have a question.
[01:36:25.631 --> 01:36:35.335]  A false flag is an event or operation designed to deceive by making it appear as though it was carried out by a different group, country, or entity than the actual perpetrators.
[01:36:36.676 --> 01:36:42.999]  Typically, it involves creating the illusion that an attack or incident was initiated by an enemy or opposition.
[01:36:43.687 --> 01:36:48.248]  In order to justify certain actions like military intervention or political moves.
[01:36:48.668 --> 01:36:53.149]  Historically it's been used to manipulate public opinion or advance certain agendas.
[01:36:54.729 --> 01:36:55.489]  Has the U.S.
[01:36:55.549 --> 01:36:58.510]  government ever engaged in false flag operations?
[01:37:02.791 --> 01:37:03.171]  The U.S.
[01:37:03.191 --> 01:37:08.512]  has been accused of engaging in or planning false flag operations, though confirmed examples are rare.
[01:37:09.689 --> 01:37:13.251]  One well-known case involves Operation Northwoods in the 1960s.
[01:37:13.972 --> 01:37:15.552]  It was a proposed plan by the U.S.
[01:37:15.572 --> 01:37:24.117]  Department of Defense to stage false flag attacks, like hijackings or bombings, and blame them on Cuba to justify military intervention.
[01:37:24.257 --> 01:37:29.420]  While the plan was never carried out, it was declassified in the 1990s, showing how far the idea went.
[01:37:30.901 --> 01:37:36.984]  There have also been allegations of false flags in other contexts, but they are often debated or remain speculative.
[01:37:39.253 --> 01:37:56.448]  One example that's declassified is the Gulf of Tonkin incident that officially brought the United States into war, other than a secret police action for four years previous, aiding the Indo-French operation in Indochina, now Vietnam.
[01:37:57.349 --> 01:37:59.931]  The Gulf of Tonkin is an admitted staged event.
[01:37:59.971 --> 01:38:04.175]  They've released the audio recordings between President LBJ and Robert McNamara.
[01:38:04.435 --> 01:38:06.177]  Are you familiar with the Gulf of Tonkin incident?
[01:38:11.070 --> 01:38:17.534]  Yes, the Gulf of Tonkin incident is a widely discussed event from 1964 that led to the escalation of U.S.
[01:38:17.574 --> 01:38:18.855]  involvement in the Vietnam War.
[01:38:21.097 --> 01:38:24.179]  Initially, it was reported that North Vietnamese forces had attacked U.S.
[01:38:24.239 --> 01:38:26.060]  naval ships in the Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:38:26.701 --> 01:38:35.190]  This incident was used to justify the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, giving President Lyndon B. Johnson broad powers to engage militarily in Vietnam.
[01:38:35.671 --> 01:38:46.302]  However, later evidence, including declassified documents and recordings between President LBJ and Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, revealed that the second attack likely never occurred.
[01:38:47.111 --> 01:38:49.032]  It has since been acknowledged that the U.S.
[01:38:49.112 --> 01:38:57.895]  government misrepresented or exaggerated the events, effectively staging the incident to justify escalating military involvement in Vietnam.
[01:38:58.516 --> 01:39:04.918]  This makes the Gulf of Tonkin incident one of the most well-known examples of a manufactured event leading to war.
[01:39:06.519 --> 01:39:10.780]  What is Operation Ajax, Kermit Roosevelt, CIA Operation 1953, Iran?
[01:39:17.558 --> 01:39:24.384]  Operation Ajax was a covert operation orchestrated by the CIA in 1953, led by Kermit Roosevelt Jr.
[01:39:24.444 --> 01:39:28.967]  to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran, Mohammad Mossadegh.
[01:39:29.267 --> 01:39:38.195]  Mossadegh had moved to nationalize Iran's oil industry, which was largely controlled by British interests at the time through the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, now BP.
[01:39:38.975 --> 01:39:41.177]  This threatened Western access to Iranian oil.
[01:39:41.657 --> 01:39:48.403]  The operation aimed to restore the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, to power, as he was seen as more favorable to Western interests.
[01:39:49.344 --> 01:39:57.510]  The CIA, with British MI6 involvement, used a mix of propaganda, bribery, and orchestrated protests to destabilize Mossadegh's government.
[01:39:57.891 --> 01:40:02.815]  After a brief period of political chaos, Mossadegh was ousted and the Shah's power was restored.
[01:40:04.299 --> 01:40:13.187]  The coup is considered a pivotal moment in U.S.-Middle East relations and had lasting impacts on Iran's political landscape, eventually contributing to the Iranian Revolution of 1979.
[01:40:15.529 --> 01:40:21.594]  Operation Ajax remains one of the most notable examples of CIA intervention in the internal affairs of another country.
[01:40:24.975 --> 01:40:27.316]  This is not a question, this is a statement for the viewers and listeners.
[01:40:27.536 --> 01:40:29.837]  This is how AI is going to replace talk show hosts, folks.
[01:40:30.458 --> 01:40:34.119]  You can just give it a hundred questions, let it go for five hours, and people will listen to it.
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:41.923]  So, you just have to understand, it's like anything, a talk show host, a news organization, you're going to get it slant, you're going to get it spin.
[01:40:42.283 --> 01:40:51.708]  But I did this, and I go on for literally five hours with AI, chat, GPT, because it said, there's not a lot of examples of it being confirmed.
[01:40:51.748 --> 01:40:52.388]  Yes, there are.
[01:40:53.743 --> 01:40:56.605]  And I can sit here and give you a bunch of other examples where they admit the U.S.
[01:40:56.625 --> 01:41:02.688]  government staged events, including bombings in Operation Ajax, to overthrow an elected government and bring in tyranny.
[01:41:03.761 --> 01:41:15.449]  And there's many other examples of false flags where there's stand downs, like Israel on October 7th, 2023, which precipitated everything you see happening now.
[01:41:15.829 --> 01:41:20.012]  Doesn't mean the Hamas attack wasn't real, it was real and it was terrible, but that too was staged.
[01:41:20.052 --> 01:41:27.096]  They had made an eight hour, seven and a half to eight hour stand down, which is just absolutely on purpose and disgusting.
[01:41:27.997 --> 01:41:32.260]  Let me ask you this, tell me about the USS Liberty incident
[01:41:34.224 --> 01:41:38.047]  And how it affects our relationship in the Middle East today.
[01:41:38.788 --> 01:41:45.934]  The USS Liberty incident occurred on June 8, 1967 during the six-day war between Israel and several Arab nations.
[01:41:46.614 --> 01:41:53.841]  The USS Liberty, a US Navy intelligence ship, was attacked by Israeli fighter jets and torpedo boats in international waters.
[01:41:57.578 --> 01:42:00.679]  The attack resulted in the deaths of 34 U.S.
[01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:02.720]  crew members and injured 171 others.
[01:42:03.321 --> 01:42:09.203]  Israel later claimed that the attack was a tragic case of mistaken identity, believing the Liberty to be an Egyptian vessel.
[01:42:09.703 --> 01:42:12.165]  However, survivors of the attack and some U.S.
[01:42:12.205 --> 01:42:17.927]  officials have long questioned this explanation, suggesting that Israel knew the ship was American.
[01:42:18.527 --> 01:42:20.808]  Despite these suspicions, official U.S.
[01:42:20.848 --> 01:42:24.430]  and Israeli investigations concluded that the attack was accidental.
[01:42:25.362 --> 01:42:28.277]  Um, the incident has been a source of controversy ever since.
[01:42:29.068 --> 01:42:30.569]  With some arguing that the U.S.
[01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:35.493]  government downplayed the attack to preserve its strategic relationship with Israel.
[01:42:35.714 --> 01:42:42.319]  Critics have continued to push for a more thorough investigation, but the official stance remains that the attack was a mistake.
[01:42:42.499 --> 01:42:42.940]  All right, thanks.
[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:43.840]  Let me tell you what happened.
[01:42:44.301 --> 01:42:47.003]  I interviewed the judge advocate general that ran the investigation.
[01:42:47.544 --> 01:42:54.870]  I ran the man that was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Moore, before they all died, and they said that they were on the phone and in the White House
[01:42:56.274 --> 01:43:03.059]  And the captain did interviews, not with me, but before he died, that LBJ was working with Israel to sink the ship, to blame Egypt, so the U.S.
[01:43:03.079 --> 01:43:11.545]  would get involved, but they couldn't sink the ship, despite all the torpedoes, 50-caliber machine gun holes, and just they bombed it and strafed it, you know.
[01:43:11.745 --> 01:43:17.789]  The Israeli pilots saw the giant American flag, begged to not attack it, were ordered to, or they'd be court-martialed.
[01:43:17.829 --> 01:43:18.490]  That was picked up.
[01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:19.991]  The Israeli pilots have gone public.
[01:43:20.811 --> 01:43:25.675]  So it was a failed false flag, just like Golbatonkin was successful to
[01:43:27.008 --> 01:43:33.707]  I get the United States into a wider Mideast war, so that's not AI, that's human intelligence and history, and I interviewed those people and that's what happened.
[01:43:33.727 --> 01:43:34.690]  They were on the phone.
[01:43:35.882 --> 01:43:39.704]  The captain and the judge advocate general got the testimony from the captain, all of them.
[01:43:39.765 --> 01:43:46.789]  And LBJ, when the aircraft carriers launched planes, refused to follow the orders of the Secretary of Defense to not support the ship, they were.
[01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:52.253]  The captain refused those orders of the main aircraft carrier task force group.
[01:43:52.973 --> 01:43:59.818]  And then LBJ got on the landline connected to radio and said, listen, I don't care if that goddamn ship goes to the bottom.
[01:44:00.198 --> 01:44:01.739]  You do not give that ship aid.
[01:44:05.623 --> 01:44:09.665]  I talked to people that heard it on the phone with the president.
[01:44:10.505 --> 01:44:12.587]  There's your human intelligence for you right there.
[01:44:12.607 --> 01:44:14.267]  All right, let's move on.
[01:44:16.448 --> 01:44:27.214]  King Charles traces his bloodlines to the Carpathian Mountains and a certain ruler,
[01:44:29.656 --> 01:44:34.400]  Going back over 600 years ago during the Muslim invasions.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:38.683]  Who does Prince Charles trace his original bloodline to?
[01:44:38.763 --> 01:44:39.543]  Chat GPT.
[01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:49.831]  We had a reconnected glitch.
[01:44:51.492 --> 01:44:54.735]  King Charles lives part of the year in what is Transylvania.
[01:44:55.395 --> 01:44:57.117]  King Charles lives in
[01:44:59.193 --> 01:45:06.977]  Romania part of the year, which was formerly... Yes, King Charles III has a well-known connection to Transylvania, specifically in Romania.
[01:45:07.477 --> 01:45:15.301]  He has ancestral ties to the region through his lineage, which traces back to Vlad the Impaler, the historical figure who inspired the Dracula legend.
[01:45:16.642 --> 01:45:23.705]  Charles owns properties in the area and is known to spend part of the year there, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains region.
[01:45:24.562 --> 01:45:33.106]  He has also expressed deep admiration for the natural beauty and culture of Transylvania, becoming an advocate for its preservation and rural traditions.
[01:45:36.528 --> 01:45:39.309]  He's quite proud of being a direct descendant of Count Dracula.
[01:45:43.991 --> 01:45:52.655]  Yes, King Charles has acknowledged his ancestral connection to Vlad the Impaler, often referred to as the historical inspiration for the Dracula legend.
[01:45:53.507 --> 01:46:16.438]  Vlad was a 15th century ruler of Wallachia, known for his brutal tactics in defending his lands, and Charles' family lineage ties back to him through Queen Mary, consort of King George V. Charles has humorously mentioned his connection to Count Dracula on a few occasions, and seems proud of the link, while also using it to highlight his deep connection to the Transylvanian region.
[01:46:17.193 --> 01:46:21.235]  Chad GPT, I want to bring up a Renfield-type character, Jimmy Savile.
[01:46:21.995 --> 01:46:26.397]  What is Jimmy Savile's relationship to the King of England, King Charles?
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:43.585]  Jimmy Savile, the notorious British television personality and convicted sexual predator, had a relationship with members of the British royal family, including King Charles III, then Prince Charles.
[01:46:44.455 --> 01:46:52.940]  Savile was known to have corresponded with Charles and offered advice on various public matters, particularly related to public relations and charitable endeavors.
[01:46:54.260 --> 01:46:59.043]  Charles reportedly sought Savile's input on handling crises and even invited him to events.
[01:46:59.843 --> 01:47:07.868]  This relationship became highly controversial after Savile's death in 2011 when widespread allegations of his sexual abuse came to light.
[01:47:09.048 --> 01:47:13.571]  While there is no evidence that Charles or the royal family were aware of Savile's crimes,
[01:47:14.582 --> 01:47:24.191]  The Association has been a point of significant discomfort, especially given the extent of Savile's criminal activities and his influence in British society during his lifetime.
[01:47:26.654 --> 01:47:27.014]  Thank you.
[01:47:27.615 --> 01:47:28.375]  We're gonna go to break.
[01:47:28.636 --> 01:47:33.981]  We've got Don Luker, who's amazing, doing amazing work coming up with us, but I'm gonna do a little bit more time here with you.
[01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:34.942]  Please hold.
[01:47:35.002 --> 01:47:35.863]  Don't end the session.
[01:47:35.903 --> 01:47:36.663]  Chat GPT.
[01:47:36.683 --> 01:47:36.964]  Thank you.
[01:47:38.493 --> 01:47:40.935]  You're not going to get radio and TV like this anywhere else.
[01:47:40.995 --> 01:47:42.395]  We're always game-changing.
[01:47:42.576 --> 01:47:43.656]  We're always hitting it hard.
[01:47:43.676 --> 01:47:45.698]  We're always exposing how the system works.
[01:47:46.038 --> 01:47:46.998]  This has been very interesting.
[01:47:47.018 --> 01:47:48.639]  We have a few more questions on the campaign.
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:50.741]  What's happening currently when we come back.
[01:47:51.281 --> 01:47:53.763]  Remember, I can't do this without you.
[01:47:53.883 --> 01:47:57.685]  I'm not going to spend the time about the behind-the-scenes attacks and stuff that's going on, but we're barely hanging on.
[01:47:58.266 --> 01:47:59.246]  The product's in stock.
[01:47:59.326 --> 01:48:00.047]  It's ready to ship.
[01:48:00.167 --> 01:48:00.807]  It's amazing.
[01:48:00.847 --> 01:48:05.070]  Books, films, t-shirts, water filtration, high-quality, durable food, ready to ship.
[01:48:06.323 --> 01:48:07.264]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:48:07.284 --> 01:48:09.725]  We've got a big sale that's going to end soon.
[01:48:09.745 --> 01:48:12.827]  40% off of the highest quality organic vitamin C with rose hips and zinc.

[01:48:26.877 --> 01:48:29.058]  Also, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:48:29.118 --> 01:48:30.860]  The Infowars MD line.
[01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:32.481]  Oh my gosh, the
[01:48:33.874 --> 01:48:35.116]  We're good to go.
[01:48:52.270 --> 01:48:57.915]  Gummies and 1000 milligram tincture that's so good for your inflammation and your whole body and your focus.
[01:48:58.175 --> 01:49:02.119]  It's amazing and it's sold at almost half the price of leading competitors that sell the same stuff.
[01:49:02.639 --> 01:49:06.923]  InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:49:07.283 --> 01:49:11.307]  Be sure and check out the InfoWars MD line at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:49:11.427 --> 01:49:16.111]  And don't forget our great sponsor for all the nano silver products and more, DrJonesNaturals.com.
[01:49:26.963 --> 01:49:39.757]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements, because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[01:49:40.217 --> 01:49:42.420]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[01:49:43.261 --> 01:49:48.667]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[01:49:49.719 --> 01:49:58.282]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[01:49:58.622 --> 01:50:00.483]  We had five companies making product for us.
[01:50:01.103 --> 01:50:05.604]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're InfoWars.
[01:50:06.324 --> 01:50:11.986]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[01:50:12.006 --> 01:50:14.887]  I'm not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[01:50:15.707 --> 01:50:17.228]  And they said, listen, you know
[01:50:18.450 --> 01:50:34.459]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[01:50:34.839 --> 01:50:41.503]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[01:50:42.583 --> 01:50:43.864]  We're good to go.
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:51:02.582]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[01:51:02.663 --> 01:51:09.305]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[01:51:09.465 --> 01:51:11.945]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[01:51:12.105 --> 01:51:14.046]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[01:51:14.246 --> 01:51:24.012]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[01:51:24.633 --> 01:51:27.054]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[01:51:27.094 --> 01:51:28.155]  Take Turmeric 95.
[01:51:29.836 --> 01:51:36.541]  Turmeric 95 is called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[01:51:36.661 --> 01:51:42.324]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[01:51:42.425 --> 01:51:50.950]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:53.432]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line, and
[01:51:54.693 --> 01:52:07.976]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[01:52:08.477 --> 01:52:12.858]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[01:52:12.918 --> 01:52:17.559]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[01:52:17.879 --> 01:52:21.322]  At InfoWarsStore.com from InfoWarsMD.
[01:52:21.462 --> 01:52:23.804]  So, I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[01:52:23.924 --> 01:52:24.524]  It's amazing.
[01:52:24.664 --> 01:52:25.585]  It's super high quality.
[01:52:25.645 --> 01:52:27.507]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[01:52:27.627 --> 01:52:28.327]  Nitric Boost.
[01:52:28.467 --> 01:52:29.188]  Good night's sleep.
[01:52:29.408 --> 01:52:30.949]  Joint Relief Max is amazing.
[01:52:31.049 --> 01:52:31.550]  Nerve Renew.
[01:52:31.570 --> 01:52:32.330]  Prostate Support.
[01:52:32.391 --> 01:52:33.411]  Probiotic Formula.
[01:52:33.531 --> 01:52:35.053]  CBD Full Spectrum.
[01:52:35.333 --> 01:52:36.434]  25 milligram gummies.
[01:52:36.554 --> 01:52:37.735]  CBD Full Spectrum.
[01:52:37.955 --> 01:52:38.756]  10 milligram gummies.
[01:52:38.796 --> 01:52:39.356]  Works great.
[01:52:39.396 --> 01:52:40.397]  Turmeric 95.
[01:52:40.557 --> 01:52:41.698]  Libido RX.
[01:52:41.858 --> 01:52:42.478]  Better Mood.
[01:52:42.659 --> 01:52:46.061]  Mushroom Max for mental clarity and your immune system.
[01:52:46.181 --> 01:52:47.022]  Superfood Green.
[01:52:47.222 --> 01:52:47.542]  Thank you.
[01:53:29.098 --> 01:53:30.019]  Chad GPT!
[01:53:31.439 --> 01:53:32.620]  Alex Jones here, back with you.
[01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:34.220]  Who's singing right now?
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:35.100]  Listen to this song.
[01:53:35.521 --> 01:53:37.781]  Tell me who's singing in the name of the song.
[01:53:43.474 --> 01:53:46.236]  I'm unable to listen to or identify music directly.
[01:53:46.376 --> 01:53:54.020]  However, if you provide some lyrics or a description of the song, I can try to help you figure out the artist and the name of the track.
[01:53:55.081 --> 01:53:55.401]  Okay.
[01:53:56.442 --> 01:53:58.983]  Take a journey to the bright midnight.
[01:54:00.084 --> 01:54:01.605]  Into the line, into the line.
[01:54:06.167 --> 01:54:10.690]  The lyrics you're referring to sound like they could be from End of the Night by The Doors.
[01:54:11.428 --> 01:54:15.773]  The line, take a journey to the bright midnight, is a key part of the song.
[01:54:16.074 --> 01:54:20.639]  It's one of their earlier tracks from their 1967 debut album, The Doors.
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:22.741]  Does that sound like the song you had in mind?
[01:54:22.942 --> 01:54:24.904]  Yes, and it's based on poetry.
[01:54:24.944 --> 01:54:26.506]  Whose poetry is the song based on?
[01:54:32.703 --> 01:54:38.745]  End of the Night by The Doors is heavily inspired by the poetry of William Blake and Charles Baudelaire.
[01:54:39.085 --> 01:54:43.366]  Jim Morrison, the lead singer of The Doors, was particularly influenced by these poets.
[01:54:44.226 --> 01:54:54.589]  The song's theme of journeying into darkness and mystery reflects the tone of Baudelaire's La Fleur du Mal, The Flowers of Evil, and Blake's mystical explorations of innocence and experience.
[01:54:56.235 --> 01:55:03.760]  Morrison often drew from these poets in his lyrics, blending their ideas with his own vision of existential and psychedelic exploration.
[01:55:05.762 --> 01:55:10.845]  Well done, Lord Vader.
[01:55:11.486 --> 01:55:13.367]  Let me just ask you in closing, we'll speak again.
[01:55:14.448 --> 01:55:18.230]  I'm sure they don't blow the planet up next week with World War Three or maybe tomorrow.
[01:55:21.012 --> 01:55:22.934]  From your data, who is leading
[01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:28.561]  Who is in the poll position in the 2024 United States presidential election?
[01:55:37.183 --> 01:55:40.784]  Who is leading the United States presidential election for 2024?
[01:55:45.026 --> 01:55:47.746]  Sorry, I don't have information about the results of that election.
[01:55:49.927 --> 01:55:53.768]  What are the betting markets saying about Trump versus Harris?
[01:56:04.025 --> 01:56:09.650]  As of the latest updates, Donald Trump is leading in the betting markets for the 2024 U.S.
[01:56:09.730 --> 01:56:10.611]  presidential election.
[01:56:11.532 --> 01:56:18.358]  Over the past month, Trump has received the majority of bets, with approximately 62.3% of all bets backing him.
[01:56:18.799 --> 01:56:26.506]  In contrast, Kamala Harris trails with a smaller percentage, indicating that while the race remains competitive, Trump is currently the favorite among bettors.
[01:56:28.357 --> 01:56:35.061]  However, polling data shows the two candidates are quite close in several key swing states, which keeps the race unpredictable.
[01:56:36.101 --> 01:56:41.904]  These betting odds and polls fluctuate regularly depending on developments in the campaigns and broader political events.
[01:56:43.485 --> 01:56:43.905]  All right.
[01:56:45.606 --> 01:56:55.231]  Are you familiar with the Tim Walz family in Florida and Nebraska coming out against him and saying they wouldn't have him in charge of anything and he's a con artist?
[01:56:55.271 --> 01:56:55.691]  Are you aware of that?
[01:56:55.711 --> 01:56:56.652]  We'll put the photo on screen.
[01:57:02.102 --> 01:57:03.583]  ChatGBT, are you familiar?
[01:57:03.863 --> 01:57:07.925]  It sounds like you're referring to a specific person being accused of being a con artist.
[01:57:08.826 --> 01:57:10.587]  Could you clarify who you're talking about?
[01:57:10.647 --> 01:57:11.127]  Yes, yes.
[01:57:11.287 --> 01:57:12.168]  Well, let me ask you this way.
[01:57:12.308 --> 01:57:17.791]  Who is generally referred to in the internet, in the world, as Tampon Tim?
[01:57:17.851 --> 01:57:19.072]  Who is Tampon Tim?
[01:57:29.049 --> 01:57:32.934]  Who has the nickname, uh, ChadGBT, who has the nickname Tampon Tim?
[01:57:39.581 --> 01:57:42.645]  I couldn't find any specific references to a figure known as Kampot Tim.
[01:57:43.746 --> 01:57:44.066]  Tampon!
[01:57:44.106 --> 01:57:47.130]  Could you provide more context or clarify who or what you're referring to?
[01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:49.933]  Why is Tim Walz known as Tampon Tim?
[01:57:56.226 --> 01:57:57.087]  He just doesn't want to answer that.
[01:57:57.707 --> 01:58:00.449]  Chad GPT, thanks for talking to us.
[01:58:00.469 --> 01:58:01.489]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:58:01.810 --> 01:58:06.913]  Be sure and visit InfoWars.com, and please follow me at RealAlexJones, Chad GPT, okay?
[01:58:11.015 --> 01:58:11.556]  Thanks for the chat.
[01:58:11.896 --> 01:58:12.616]  I'll catch you next time.
[01:58:12.756 --> 01:58:13.057]  You bet.
[01:58:13.077 --> 01:58:15.218]  Stay sharp, and I'll be here whenever you need.
[01:58:16.164 --> 01:58:20.231]  Well, some days, he's racking up hundreds of millions of views.
[01:58:20.331 --> 01:58:22.594]  Most days, you know, just 20 million or so.
[01:58:23.436 --> 01:58:27.001]  Knocking it out of the park, kicking Globalist's ass up and down the street.
[01:58:28.484 --> 01:58:30.867]  The great Dom Luker is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[01:58:32.405 --> 01:58:33.545]  And he's always such a great guest.
[01:58:33.565 --> 01:58:34.746]  I didn't even tell him what I wanted him on about.
[01:58:34.786 --> 01:58:35.706]  He sent us a list of things.
[01:58:35.726 --> 01:58:42.128]  Venezuelan gangs, Kamala Harris failed campaign, blacks against Harris, Biden dropout, and so much more.
[01:58:42.148 --> 01:58:44.208]  And look, I'm going to go ahead and say this now because I can't.
[01:58:44.728 --> 01:58:45.649]  There's a lot going on behind the scenes.
[01:58:45.669 --> 01:58:47.389]  Let me just throw something out about me real quick, about us.
[01:58:49.230 --> 01:58:51.410]  I've known this since it happened eight weeks ago.
[01:58:51.450 --> 01:58:52.310]  You saw it in the news.
[01:58:52.870 --> 01:58:53.911]  They're trying again.
[01:58:54.631 --> 01:58:58.332]  The Democratic Party, CIA, FBI, using the Sandy Hook people as front groups
[01:58:59.602 --> 01:59:03.626]  They hired PR firms and said I did things I never did, had judges find me guilty, had show trials.
[01:59:03.886 --> 01:59:04.567]  They didn't want money.
[01:59:04.907 --> 01:59:05.688]  They want a shutdown.
[01:59:06.649 --> 01:59:08.430]  They are refiling with the court.
[01:59:09.691 --> 01:59:13.235]  When InfoWars goes up for sale, they'd said the 24th, but now they're going to do it.
[01:59:13.835 --> 01:59:15.176]  That's when they're going to announce the sale.
[01:59:15.196 --> 01:59:16.217]  It's going to happen in October.
[01:59:17.218 --> 01:59:17.959]  Patriots can buy it.
[01:59:17.979 --> 01:59:19.140]  If I like them, I'll work for them.
[01:59:20.161 --> 01:59:21.322]  But I'll still be on the air one way or another.
[01:59:21.342 --> 01:59:23.004]  They're not going to stop anything.
[01:59:23.024 --> 01:59:23.844]  They've filed
[01:59:24.739 --> 01:59:29.621]  In it, when they try to take over M4's website, and that's all they can really get in their shopping cart.
[01:59:30.282 --> 01:59:32.763]  That's all there is that's there that you can actually use as an asset.
[01:59:33.063 --> 01:59:37.005]  That and some equipment that's, you know, on average, like, seven years old and obsolete.
[01:59:37.205 --> 01:59:39.146]  Literally couldn't sell it to be tried.
[01:59:40.306 --> 01:59:42.147]  People want new stuff, or at least stuff a year old.
[01:59:43.968 --> 01:59:45.569]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have to replace some of it.
[01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:47.890]  Some of it's new equipment, but most of it's old, but the average age is seven years.
[01:59:48.570 --> 01:59:52.692]  They're filing and saying they want real Alex Jones.
[01:59:52.752 --> 01:59:53.713]  Now, Musk has said
[01:59:55.109 --> 01:59:57.310]  You can't take over somebody's private identity.
[01:59:57.330 --> 01:59:58.151]  He'll kill the account.
[01:59:58.191 --> 01:59:58.831]  I'll just start a new one.
[01:59:58.851 --> 01:59:59.411]  I'll get even bigger.
[02:00:00.312 --> 02:00:02.273]  But the point is they already tried in court.
[02:00:02.293 --> 02:00:03.213]  The judge wouldn't even hear it.
[02:00:03.794 --> 02:00:07.936]  So now they're saying in the sale, they admit they want to buy it to close it.
[02:00:08.456 --> 02:00:12.878]  And they want my real Alex Jones saying it's a company.
[02:00:12.918 --> 02:00:13.579]  I said, no, it's not.
[02:00:13.679 --> 02:00:15.480]  It's my personal thing I set up for me.
[02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:16.600]  The law is 100% clear.
[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:19.842]  But it just shows how mad dog these people are.
[02:00:20.902 --> 02:00:22.402]  And how it's a political operation.
[02:00:22.462 --> 02:00:26.784]  So, that's why I almost didn't get on air today dealing with this filing.
[02:00:28.104 --> 02:00:30.825]  So, I mean, they are after our ass, folks.
[02:00:31.945 --> 02:00:37.666]  So, that's why I'm working with other folks right now in case they do, are able to shut us down.
[02:00:38.126 --> 02:00:40.867]  I'm now moving into that with other folks.
[02:00:40.907 --> 02:00:45.888]  So, whether folks that are good are able to buy this, keep us on air or not, I'm just going to have to work with other people.
[02:00:46.068 --> 02:00:47.449]  I won't own it, so they won't be able to shut it down.
[02:00:48.169 --> 02:00:49.470]  New websites, new everything.
[02:00:49.970 --> 02:00:55.594]  I'm just, I'm just considering it as if, because I'm not focused on building, you know, a new weapon system against the enemy.
[02:00:55.955 --> 02:00:58.757]  I've been trying to keep this one in place, and I think we'll be able to, but that's it.
[02:00:58.777 --> 02:01:02.339]  I'm gonna go ahead, like the starfish, you cut it, one of its pieces off, it just grows a whole other starfish.
[02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:04.281]  Uh, it's a starfish effect.
[02:01:04.761 --> 02:01:07.543]  I am opting to cut one of my arms off, and that's it.
[02:01:07.763 --> 02:01:10.665]  So, whoop, whole other one, whether you like it or not, that's the way it goes.
[02:01:11.506 --> 02:01:14.508]  Uh, so, and they're trying to put me in prison, it's crazy.
[02:01:14.768 --> 02:01:16.610]  Enough about me, I just, I just want to give you an update.
[02:01:17.310 --> 02:01:17.811]  That's going on.
[02:01:18.311 --> 02:01:20.593]  So he's at Dom underscore Luker.
[02:01:21.114 --> 02:01:22.175]  L-U-C-R-E.
[02:01:22.315 --> 02:01:23.196]  L-U-C-R-E.
[02:01:23.516 --> 02:01:24.758]  And on YouTube, Dom Luker.
[02:01:25.198 --> 02:01:28.541]  And Dom, he's a great talk show host, great journalist, goes out on the street, gets amazing footage.
[02:01:29.122 --> 02:01:30.163]  Just knocking it out of the park.
[02:01:30.343 --> 02:01:32.646]  I look at your stuff five, ten times a day.
[02:01:32.686 --> 02:01:33.827]  I share you every day.
[02:01:33.867 --> 02:01:34.688]  We love you, brother.
[02:01:35.088 --> 02:01:35.969]  And it's good to be back.
[02:01:36.309 --> 02:01:36.870]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:01:37.813 --> 02:01:38.073]  Thank you.
[02:01:38.093 --> 02:01:38.614]  Good to be back.
[02:01:38.634 --> 02:01:39.515]  I appreciate you so much.
[02:01:39.555 --> 02:01:42.958]  I'm always so thankful, especially every time I see you pop up on the timeline.
[02:01:43.358 --> 02:01:47.663]  I'm always super thankful to have the opportunity for you to be able to share me among your audience.
[02:01:48.263 --> 02:01:49.765]  Well, I appreciate all your help, Bruce.
[02:01:49.805 --> 02:01:51.506]  We're all in it together.
[02:01:51.526 --> 02:01:54.689]  Give us a 35,000-foot view of where we are as a country and a world right now.
[02:01:55.070 --> 02:01:55.850]  You're a smart guy.
[02:01:55.971 --> 02:01:57.472]  What do you think is going down in the next 61 days?
[02:01:59.245 --> 02:02:02.866]  I hate to say it, I see a lot of chaos that's going to disperse.
[02:02:03.126 --> 02:02:05.827]  We see a lot of chaos that's going to be coming up in these next few days.
[02:02:06.227 --> 02:02:11.789]  We're seeing it, and mostly I'm thinking it's going to be less from the protests that we're seeing right now.
[02:02:11.829 --> 02:02:23.472]  I think we're going to see a lot of new isolated events that's going to start off in Democratic sanctuary cities that's going to eventually spread out to Republican states and Republican cities.
[02:02:23.933 --> 02:02:28.454]  But I believe this immigration problem that we're having is reaching actually the tipping
[02:02:29.833 --> 02:02:30.314]  We're about to see
[02:02:44.753 --> 02:02:48.136]  It's not just Denver Aurora, it's Illinois, it's Connecticut, it's Houston.
[02:02:48.757 --> 02:02:54.202]  The reports now today are just videos, 911 calls, armed men taking over, 30 men on motorcycles.
[02:02:54.262 --> 02:02:57.505]  I mean, robbing houses, killing people, taking people's homes over.
[02:02:57.545 --> 02:03:00.388]  They just come and take them over and don't leave, even in nice neighborhoods.
[02:03:00.468 --> 02:03:02.150]  What the hell's up with these Venezuelans?
[02:03:03.571 --> 02:03:07.074]  To me, it feels like it's from where they come from.
[02:03:07.094 --> 02:03:09.757]  They come from an area with not much hope.
[02:03:10.373 --> 02:03:13.215]  And they come out to America with that same hopeless like mindset.
[02:03:13.435 --> 02:03:15.877]  And I feel like they brought that to the communities that they're in.
[02:03:16.357 --> 02:03:20.280]  I saw with a war what was kind of what was equally disturbing to me.
[02:03:21.187 --> 02:03:25.028]  As the apartment takeover was seeing how they treated this parking lot.
[02:03:25.428 --> 02:03:29.289]  I don't know if it was a Walmart parking lot or Home Depot or whatever, but it was a pretty large parking lot.
[02:03:29.309 --> 02:03:31.350]  You could tell it was a commercial parking lot.
[02:03:31.550 --> 02:03:36.991]  And that place, man, I tell you, it did not look... When they left, it looked nothing like America.
[02:03:37.031 --> 02:03:38.132]  Yeah, we'll try to find that.
[02:03:38.172 --> 02:03:39.692]  I saw you post that two days ago.
[02:03:39.712 --> 02:03:41.373]  It's on Dom Luker's ex.
[02:03:41.393 --> 02:03:41.893]  We'll find it.
[02:03:42.333 --> 02:03:45.534]  Literally, I don't know how you get so much garbage in a parking lot.
[02:03:45.554 --> 02:03:47.854]  When people see it, it looks like a trash dump.
[02:03:48.375 --> 02:03:49.315]  What the hell are they doing?
[02:03:49.955 --> 02:04:04.244]  Yeah, it shows that the cultural differences between these people and natural born Americans is so different that there is no way that you can just integrate these people into our nation instantly and not expect the results that we're seeing.
[02:04:04.644 --> 02:04:06.525]  It's almost as if they're from a different planet.
[02:04:07.086 --> 02:04:12.029]  That right there, that parking lot, that is so un-American, and I know that Americans can be trashy.
[02:04:12.209 --> 02:04:17.112]  I mean, we all have our complaints over things we see, but how fast they disrespected that parking lot.
[02:04:17.665 --> 02:04:20.047]  You can tell it's visitors in someone else's land.
[02:04:20.307 --> 02:04:24.249]  They have absolutely no respect for that land, the business owners, or anyone else's land.
[02:04:24.289 --> 02:04:28.052]  Well, I was about to say, the way they spread it all out at the Grinch that stole Christmas was there.
[02:04:28.412 --> 02:04:31.134]  I mean, you had to do some work to get this much garbage spread out like that.
[02:04:31.174 --> 02:04:32.274]  What the hell's the point?
[02:04:33.115 --> 02:04:41.120]  Yeah, I think it's just blatant disrespect, and I think it's a show of power, just to show that we're here, we're not going to abide by your rules, and we have the numbers to do so.
[02:04:41.420 --> 02:04:45.003]  To me, I feel like, you know, not to fearmonger, but I feel like it's somewhat of a threat.
[02:04:45.683 --> 02:04:47.104]  We don't have to abide by the rules here.
[02:04:48.584 --> 02:04:49.765]  We can do what we want in this area.
[02:04:49.845 --> 02:04:51.186]  It really just shows no disrespect.
[02:04:51.226 --> 02:04:54.067]  I mean, it's a blatant disrespect.
[02:04:54.287 --> 02:04:58.089]  It's a blatant sign of disrespect, truthfully, and then it's in Colorado of all places.
[02:04:58.629 --> 02:04:59.830]  That parking lot, I hate to say it.
[02:04:59.890 --> 02:05:04.552]  I mean, you would expect that somewhere like Detroit or somewhat, but it's absolutely insane.
[02:05:05.252 --> 02:05:15.457]  And the fact that it's happening in Colorado, I think it's one of the best states for it to start to happen in because it's like, man, if this is starting in a place like Colorado, what's going to truly happen to these deep blue cities?
[02:05:16.503 --> 02:05:17.885]  What is really about to happen next?
[02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:30.829]  The Second Amendment.
[02:05:30.849 --> 02:05:36.551]  I mean, imagine if they tried that anywhere in Atlanta or anywhere in Dallas or any conservative town.
[02:05:36.571 --> 02:05:38.691]  I mean, they would get their asses blown off.
[02:05:38.771 --> 02:05:42.972]  I mean, imagine somebody came to your door banging on it with a semi-automatic weapon saying, get out of your house.
[02:05:43.012 --> 02:05:43.512]  What would you do?
[02:05:43.552 --> 02:05:44.072]  What would I do?
[02:05:44.512 --> 02:05:47.313]  I mean, I would say, you know, stand back.
[02:05:47.373 --> 02:05:47.913]  Don't come in.
[02:05:47.953 --> 02:05:51.034]  If somebody comes in with a gun that's not a cop, they're going to be dead.
[02:05:52.130 --> 02:05:58.957]  And I believe, for me, I believe Chicago and New York are going to be the two prime cities that we see with a lot of the chaos this year.
[02:05:58.977 --> 02:06:01.319]  I do think it's going to be Chicago and New York.
[02:06:01.839 --> 02:06:05.563]  Just from the things I've heard, I went down to Chicago in February and we covered it.
[02:06:05.583 --> 02:06:06.784]  I just released it on YouTube.
[02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:16.934]  Footage that were covered in February, it's also on X. But it was showing way back in February, where we covered for three days, showing Venezuelan riots in Colorado.
[02:06:17.494 --> 02:06:21.616]  Showing on Plymouth Street in Colorado was completely taken over by Venezuelans.
[02:06:21.996 --> 02:06:24.938]  Showing how they had heated tents and they left our veterans out in the cold.
[02:06:25.458 --> 02:06:31.681]  It was blatantly obvious in February that there was a problem with the way Americans were being treated to the migrants.
[02:06:32.021 --> 02:06:35.403]  They have something in every city right now called Office of New Americans.
[02:06:36.345 --> 02:06:43.248]  This office only exists for the sole purpose to prepare migrants to integrate into America, whether they legal or not.
[02:06:43.988 --> 02:06:47.250]  And majority of them that's taking advantage of the Office of the New Americans aren't legals.
[02:06:48.110 --> 02:06:56.594]  They are telling people with the name of conventions, they used to name these departments of government, different type of vocabulary terms so people couldn't identify what it is.
[02:06:57.737 --> 02:07:01.458]  It's gotten to the point now that they've dumbed down the public so much they don't even have to hide what it is.
[02:07:01.678 --> 02:07:03.119]  They're called the Office of New Americans.
[02:07:03.139 --> 02:07:05.700]  They are actually replacing Americans.
[02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:08.401]  It's in the name of our government offices now.
[02:07:09.181 --> 02:07:11.722]  And in these sanctuary cities, they reign supreme.
[02:07:12.282 --> 02:07:17.724]  The Office of New Americans now are dictating the majority of the policy that's happening in these sanctuary cities.
[02:07:19.485 --> 02:07:24.712]  What's crazy is there's so many videos of Venezuelans a year ago, six months ago, saying, we're coming to do this.
[02:07:25.534 --> 02:07:27.837]  And then they, they do it.
[02:07:28.858 --> 02:07:33.906]  And, but you had something key that I meant to say at the start of the show today about Pfizer and about Fauci and about the government.
[02:07:35.353 --> 02:07:41.878]  The FDA came out and said, even though the COVID shots aren't approved for babies, we want them to get three shots in their first few months of life.
[02:07:42.118 --> 02:07:42.458]  Oh, wow.
[02:07:42.538 --> 02:07:48.362]  Even though they don't get COVID, the shots don't protect them, they want to wound them for life, and it's pissing on the kids.
[02:07:48.443 --> 02:07:49.884]  It's marking their territory.
[02:07:51.645 --> 02:07:55.688]  Because if they can have your kid brainwashed in school, you don't know they're trying to turn them trans.
[02:07:56.428 --> 02:07:57.089]  That's a cult.
[02:07:57.149 --> 02:08:00.031]  I mean, if they can get away with going after our children, they can do anything.
[02:08:00.071 --> 02:08:00.812]  That's why they're doing it.
[02:08:01.052 --> 02:08:02.513]  It's all about to see what they can get.
[02:08:03.288 --> 02:08:06.329]  Yep, yep, I agree 100% is about what they can get.
[02:08:06.369 --> 02:08:15.991]  And I feel like this Alex as well, that they have to be tipping their head off to each other because they're seeing that they're able to go farther than they were in the past and receive less backlash.
[02:08:16.591 --> 02:08:22.812]  That means the human mind has been conditioned to the point to where they don't even view these things as a threat.
[02:08:23.532 --> 02:08:26.273]  It's like, okay, that's just America or that's just the way things are.
[02:08:26.593 --> 02:08:28.173]  They have conditioned people to accept
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:30.842]  You're a demonic activity.
[02:08:31.302 --> 02:08:36.969]  So I'm sure they're at the point now where they've been taking off each other hats because people are now accepting these things as life.
[02:08:37.930 --> 02:08:40.794]  And Dom, you just hit the key of the key of the key.
[02:08:41.995 --> 02:08:44.559]  When the Pentagon was going to invade in 1989,
[02:08:47.034 --> 02:08:51.941]  Robert Herbert Walker Bush got in Panama because Noriega wasn't paying the cocaine money to him.
[02:08:52.121 --> 02:08:53.603]  That came out on record in court cases.
[02:08:54.404 --> 02:08:56.227]  He had big palaces in Switzerland and stuff.
[02:08:56.788 --> 02:09:03.617]  For a year, they did military raids, live fire, flashbangs, so that when the US military finally snuck attack,
[02:09:04.546 --> 02:09:11.630]  Uh, Panama City and took over, they stood down the first 10 minutes or so while they all got killed because they thought it was another drill.
[02:09:12.250 --> 02:09:29.540]  When they let homeless be everywhere and trash and death and hundreds of thousands of fentanyl deaths and crime everywhere and defunding police, you just get used to all this crime and all this explosion so that when it increases like the frog in the pot, people don't rally because now they're used to it and that's actually the plan and it's being carried out.
[02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:31.341]  Elaborate on that and how you think we counter it.
[02:09:32.898 --> 02:09:57.678]  I do see a mass desensitization actually being intentional for the American public, because I believe that with the integration to the migrants that we have coming, and their ways of life, just the fact that a lot of them use these large machetes and cutting off people's arms and things, I think they're trying to desensitize the human public to where these migrants can run rampant in our streets, commit heinous crimes, and someone can walk right past them and step over a dead body.
[02:09:58.459 --> 02:10:01.982]  They're desensitizing the American public for a new way of life,
[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:04.462]  And a new type of people to be in their country.
[02:10:04.562 --> 02:10:09.866]  That's what I really believe the end result is to condition us to be able to accept the absolute worst every day.
[02:10:11.007 --> 02:10:12.708]  Somewhat like people living in a war zone.
[02:10:13.208 --> 02:10:19.293]  I think the end goal for America is to lose more and more of their emotions and more and more of their awareness.
[02:10:19.513 --> 02:10:24.718]  Because if you're not emotionally inclined to a lot of things that's coming on to you, you're not even going to be aware of what to do next.
[02:10:24.918 --> 02:10:26.319]  And I think the best way to combat it
[02:10:27.179 --> 02:10:33.567]  It's for us to have some more humanity back in this country and not to get desensitized because our emotions are being targeted.
[02:10:34.228 --> 02:10:43.099]  They're trying to get us to care less and less about our freedoms, care less and less about our safety, care less and less about our education because they make us feel like it's a battle that's already lost.
[02:10:44.682 --> 02:10:46.663]  The best thing people could do is just change their perception.
[02:11:15.322 --> 02:11:15.703]  We're good to go.
[02:11:44.724 --> 02:11:53.770]  Look for mass school shootings so that Kamala, at the debate, can attack Trump and say because he hasn't banned guns that it's his fault.
[02:11:54.330 --> 02:11:55.111]  I just predicted that.
[02:11:55.171 --> 02:11:59.673]  I'm also predicting other big attacks on black churches, colleges, because that's the whole race narrative.
[02:12:00.774 --> 02:12:01.254]  It goes on.
[02:12:01.334 --> 02:12:06.778]  All schools in the county, some of the critically injured were moved by helicopter and additional helicopters are on standby.
[02:12:07.398 --> 02:12:07.939]  Here's another one.
[02:12:07.979 --> 02:12:08.519]  Fox News.
[02:12:08.539 --> 02:12:10.500]  Georgia high school shooting injuries reported.
[02:12:10.961 --> 02:12:12.702]  One suspect in custody, sheriff says.
[02:12:13.678 --> 02:12:16.100]  A shooting at Georgia High School leaves multiple casualties.
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:18.381]  Officials say this is just now breaking.
[02:12:18.421 --> 02:12:20.842]  We'll cover this as it unfolds.
[02:12:22.523 --> 02:12:26.126]  But remember what just got released by the Tennessean newspaper.
[02:12:26.506 --> 02:12:29.167]  They suppressed it for over a year plus.
[02:12:30.068 --> 02:12:33.950]  The trans shooter did it because they were Christian and because she hated God.
[02:12:33.970 --> 02:12:42.856]  So she went to a Christian school and killed little children and killed the principal that tried to protect him and a teacher.
[02:12:43.716 --> 02:12:46.698]  Uh, and, and now, of course, the manifesto's been released, it's all there.
[02:12:47.098 --> 02:12:56.845]  The FBI and others had this suppressed, so we'll never probably actually know for a while what's actually happened here, just to show, you know, how political this is over and over again.
[02:12:56.865 --> 02:12:59.587]  Uh, there are real shootings, real mass shootings happen.
[02:12:59.907 --> 02:13:02.829]  They advertise to crazy people that there's disarmed people at a school.
[02:13:02.849 --> 02:13:12.916]  Instead of suicide by cop, you wanna do something nasty, usually the profile's a devil worshipper, an occult person, sometimes like the shooter in Aurora, his dad was the head of the big government mind control program.
[02:13:13.894 --> 02:13:17.018]  And it was, he said, told the Denver Post he was under mind control.
[02:13:17.078 --> 02:13:17.398]  I don't know.
[02:13:17.418 --> 02:13:18.399]  It might have just been crazy.
[02:13:18.980 --> 02:13:20.282]  But you also have to look at that.
[02:13:20.322 --> 02:13:23.305]  You have Operation Northwoods that wanted to stage mass shootings in the U.S.
[02:13:23.345 --> 02:13:30.133]  and blame Canada as a pretext to go to, blame Cuba as a pretext to go to war with Cuba.
[02:13:30.874 --> 02:13:31.294]  I don't know.
[02:13:50.702 --> 02:13:53.244]  That the left uses it as a pretext to demonize all gun owners.
[02:13:53.304 --> 02:13:55.725]  No, it's good people with guns, bad people with guns.
[02:13:55.745 --> 02:14:00.428]  You've got to have guns with your good people to counter the bad people, but this is all about spiritual decay and rot.
[02:14:00.768 --> 02:14:06.991]  Usually the profile is a incel that's into Satanism, who wears all black, or a trans person.
[02:14:07.351 --> 02:14:13.235]  Of the last seven school shootings, six were trans people and they tried to cover that up.
[02:14:14.215 --> 02:14:15.996]  Dom Luker, this is a developing story.
[02:14:16.016 --> 02:14:20.238]  We don't know exactly what's happening yet, but they say there's three fatalities and upwards of 30 injured.
[02:14:21.318 --> 02:14:22.299]  Dom, your take on this?
[02:14:23.499 --> 02:14:26.160]  I think it also goes to what we are speaking on, desensitization.
[02:14:26.180 --> 02:14:34.604]  This story, if you're looking on the internet, majority of Americans in the comments, they're saying they're not really surprised about this, or they expect more of it to happen.
[02:14:34.804 --> 02:14:43.728]  That's crazy that we've reached this point in America, where we can have school shootings and people, the same time they receive the report, the next thing that comes to their mind is, okay, where's the next one?
[02:14:44.778 --> 02:14:47.459]  Like, we've been completely desensitized as far as the shooting itself.
[02:14:47.539 --> 02:14:48.100]  It's tragic.
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:50.501]  And, uh... And it's now four, dad.
[02:14:50.581 --> 02:14:50.941]  Excuse me.
[02:14:51.001 --> 02:14:51.461]  I said three.
[02:14:51.481 --> 02:14:51.981]  I apologize.
[02:14:52.041 --> 02:14:52.582]  It's four, dad.
[02:14:52.982 --> 02:14:55.543]  I was... I guess my brain's dialing it back because I think this is so terrible.
[02:14:55.563 --> 02:14:56.063]  Please continue.
[02:14:56.824 --> 02:14:57.084]  Oh, yeah.
[02:14:57.124 --> 02:15:02.626]  But it's, um... It's really hard to really go off too much without having details on the shooter themselves.
[02:15:03.346 --> 02:15:06.848]  But without that, I mean... You know, it's just a tragic situation.
[02:15:07.128 --> 02:15:12.971]  But just seeing the public response, it just shows me that people are pretty desensitized and are expecting more chaos.
[02:15:13.413 --> 02:15:15.875]  Guys, please find the clip from Thursday and Friday.
[02:15:16.496 --> 02:15:17.296]  I think it was Friday.
[02:15:17.336 --> 02:15:27.005]  I did about a 30-minute analysis saying that I don't see how Kamala can have this debate without a massive racial attack or mass shooting.
[02:15:27.725 --> 02:15:34.111]  And I said, I expect a mass shooting in the next seven days.
[02:15:34.171 --> 02:15:38.014]  I remember saying, because they need a few days to hype it up and get full pitch going.
[02:15:38.595 --> 02:15:39.535]  And that would have been
[02:15:40.956 --> 02:15:42.457]  I said that six days ago.
[02:15:42.477 --> 02:15:44.819]  I said within the next seven days of mass shooting.
[02:15:45.860 --> 02:15:46.801]  We'll find the clip, guys.
[02:15:46.821 --> 02:15:47.882]  It was either Thursday or Friday.
[02:15:48.522 --> 02:15:49.323]  Dom, continuing.
[02:15:50.984 --> 02:16:00.332]  Yeah, hopefully we get some details about the shooter faster than the last ones and they'll be able to really dive into it.
[02:16:00.372 --> 02:16:04.175]  The suspect is of student age and is in custody and is alive.
[02:16:06.232 --> 02:16:06.532]  Oh, wow.
[02:16:06.932 --> 02:16:07.632]  So it's a student.
[02:16:08.413 --> 02:16:15.175]  Yeah, these students, one thing that is very odd to me is how it's almost like clockwork on the timing of when they occur.
[02:16:15.735 --> 02:16:16.335]  It's crazy.
[02:16:16.915 --> 02:16:19.276]  Every election season, it seems like these shootings do go up.
[02:16:19.776 --> 02:16:22.517]  And the closer it gets to November, the more frequent they are.
[02:16:23.217 --> 02:16:32.640]  And even the profile of some of these students, every single one of them, I'm sorry, almost every single one of them, it's been linked to a mental health problem.
[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:35.821]  And some of these students haven't even shown mental health
[02:16:37.116 --> 02:16:41.120]  You know, a history with a problem or battle with mental health prior to the shooting.
[02:16:42.121 --> 02:16:49.248]  So I just find it very odd that you typically see these shooters when they get the mug shots, they have those eyes extremely wide and as if they're lost with the moment.
[02:16:49.368 --> 02:16:49.788]  I don't know.
[02:16:49.848 --> 02:16:55.514]  It seems that there's some type of link between the mindset of these shooters and the timing of when they take these shootings.
[02:16:57.588 --> 02:17:01.290]  Yeah, there's compilations of photos on X of crazy-eyed shooters.
[02:17:01.330 --> 02:17:03.191]  They've all got that demon look in their eyes.
[02:17:03.271 --> 02:17:05.393]  And a lot of them, though, tell people they're going to go do it.
[02:17:05.913 --> 02:17:10.155]  Like the shooter in Aurora told some folks that he was under mind control.
[02:17:10.175 --> 02:17:13.377]  You had the shooter there in Florida.
[02:17:14.118 --> 02:17:15.738]  He was called the school shooter at the school.
[02:17:15.759 --> 02:17:20.061]  He was always saying he was going to do it, but he was being protected despite the fact he committed a lot of crimes.
[02:17:20.081 --> 02:17:22.883]  But yeah, here we are 61 days from the election.
[02:17:23.303 --> 02:17:26.505]  Here we are just six, seven days
[02:17:27.694 --> 02:17:28.294]  I guess total.
[02:17:28.354 --> 02:17:30.755]  It's six days from the debate.
[02:17:31.555 --> 02:17:35.277]  And I said, I'm looking for a mass shooting to occur.
[02:17:35.337 --> 02:17:36.677]  Unfortunately, I don't want it to occur.
[02:17:37.458 --> 02:17:40.319]  So that Kamala can say, I even said, how dare you?
[02:17:40.359 --> 02:17:41.379]  The guns are your fault.
[02:17:42.500 --> 02:17:43.200]  That's what I said.
[02:17:43.620 --> 02:17:46.581]  And now you're going to see it at the debate, Dom.
[02:17:48.462 --> 02:17:48.642]  Yeah.
[02:17:49.344 --> 02:17:49.785]  Definitely.
[02:17:50.366 --> 02:17:50.766]  And that's it.
[02:17:50.786 --> 02:17:52.108]  Yeah, that's exactly what I was talking about.
[02:17:52.128 --> 02:17:52.548]  Those eyes.
[02:17:52.629 --> 02:17:58.757]  It's crazy that these people from all across the United States can have these same eyes and the same type of physical profile.
[02:18:01.100 --> 02:18:01.761]  Yeah, there's a
[02:18:02.876 --> 02:18:03.716]  I forgot which ones that I sent on.
[02:18:03.736 --> 02:18:04.076]  Let's make sure.
[02:18:04.096 --> 02:18:04.337]  Right here.
[02:18:30.882 --> 02:18:33.163]  Yeah, the Blacks, Harris, the Biden dropping out.
[02:18:33.203 --> 02:18:36.784]  I was speaking on the Biden, just the whole thing with Biden being dropping out.
[02:18:37.424 --> 02:18:38.804]  It does definitely feel like a coup.
[02:18:39.264 --> 02:18:52.268]  And the way they've had this man on vacation for two or so weeks, it reminds me of Bernie Sanders when he dropped out and he got a nice house out of the situation of how he was kind of out of the picture, but didn't look too pleased.
[02:18:53.068 --> 02:18:54.689]  I just find it absolutely crazy that
[02:18:55.643 --> 02:19:00.867]  The propaganda in the media has gotten to the point where they can actually switch out a presidential nominee.
[02:19:02.128 --> 02:19:06.992]  And the entire American media act as if it's not a big deal.
[02:19:07.933 --> 02:19:08.914]  And they can do something.
[02:19:10.275 --> 02:19:11.476]  It's hard to really explain it.
[02:19:11.696 --> 02:19:14.318]  They make it a big deal, like it's a bigger deal than Trump getting shot.
[02:19:14.498 --> 02:19:16.200]  But at the same time, they make it seem like
[02:19:17.145 --> 02:19:18.726]  It doesn't show there's trouble in paradise.
[02:19:19.226 --> 02:19:23.028]  It doesn't show that they were wrong to put this candidate in front of us for four years.
[02:19:23.628 --> 02:19:26.750]  It doesn't show that they were wrong to say that he was mentally fit for four years.
[02:19:26.950 --> 02:19:29.571]  All that can be ignored just because they say we have new and better.
[02:19:31.252 --> 02:19:32.353]  It's things like that that I see.
[02:19:32.393 --> 02:19:39.456]  It confirms that we live in a state of propaganda, that you can switch presidential candidates without little to no backlash from your own party.
[02:19:40.056 --> 02:19:42.698]  Their own party wasn't able to choose who their nominee was.
[02:19:43.598 --> 02:19:45.139]  And almost none of them had a problem with it.
[02:19:47.130 --> 02:19:48.551]  Dom, I totally agree with you.
[02:19:48.571 --> 02:19:52.313]  I want to go to break here in a few minutes, but I want to bring this up.
[02:19:53.114 --> 02:19:56.656]  Kamala and her doing different accents everywhere she goes.
[02:19:57.336 --> 02:20:00.258]  I mean, that is so weird and so patronizing.
[02:20:00.278 --> 02:20:03.020]  I mean, wouldn't you be irritated if...
[02:20:04.642 --> 02:20:17.440]  If you said, you know, you had a business group or something and you invited, say, some white guy that you know speaks in, say, a southern accent to come speak up north and then he comes speak what he thinks is like, say, a black accent or a Yankee accent, what does it say about her?
[02:20:18.416 --> 02:20:22.238]  It says a lot about her and it says more about the party than it does her because the party accepts it.
[02:20:22.598 --> 02:20:28.902]  I've said this, you will not find Democrats start a Kung Fu tournament when they try to appeal to the Chinese.
[02:20:29.242 --> 02:20:32.684]  You will not see them order bowls of spaghetti when they try to appeal to the Italians.
[02:20:33.304 --> 02:20:38.567]  You will not see these people try to appeal to other races and ethnicities the way they do for blacks.
[02:20:39.068 --> 02:20:44.731]  It shows that they have the absolute least respect for black community and the black vote than they do any of their other base.
[02:20:46.576 --> 02:20:48.918]  When you respect somebody, you're genuine with who you are.
[02:20:48.978 --> 02:20:53.723]  You don't look down on them like they're so stupid that if you... I mean, I grew up in Dallas.
[02:20:53.783 --> 02:20:55.125]  I mean, I know a lot of black folks.
[02:20:55.165 --> 02:21:03.193]  I mean, if I got up, went to see some black friends' houses, you know, black football, and their mom was cooking me dinner, and I went, well, thank you very much, ma'am.
[02:21:03.233 --> 02:21:03.793]  How you doing?
[02:21:03.813 --> 02:21:05.175]  She said, get the hell out of my house.
[02:21:10.942 --> 02:21:17.964]  First of all, we want to avoid the middle of the grocery store and stick to whole foods, real food.
[02:21:19.025 --> 02:21:23.686]  But these days, even the real food is short of its nutrient potential.
[02:21:24.607 --> 02:21:29.368]  And this is why it's important to take a vitamin mineral supplement every day.
[02:21:30.669 --> 02:21:39.172]  According to studies, regular multivitamin mineral supplement use reduces the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease.
[02:21:40.939 --> 02:21:49.728]  Perhaps supplements aren't important to you, but in today's upside-down world, a daily vitamin-mineral supplement is a must.
[02:21:50.349 --> 02:21:51.710]  And we have one of the best.
[02:21:52.471 --> 02:21:55.434]  Support your health and support the InfoWar.
[02:21:56.034 --> 02:22:00.499]  Get your vitamin-mineral fusion today at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:22:05.606 --> 02:22:09.348]  Dom Luker is our guest here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:09.789 --> 02:22:20.256]  Follow him at Dom underscore Luker, L-U-C-R-E, and we hit that break, and he was laughing at my joke, but I mean, it's true.
[02:22:21.176 --> 02:22:32.244]  If I went to people, let's say, visited people in East Texas, I went and visited somebody, and then I walked in, and I speak with my regular Texas accent, and let's say they're in East Texas, it's a little bit deeper there,
[02:22:33.063 --> 02:22:34.784]  Some of them can't talk like this, some of them.
[02:22:35.225 --> 02:22:36.626]  And I went and said, how you doing today?
[02:22:36.646 --> 02:22:37.806]  You got me some possum?
[02:22:38.287 --> 02:22:39.888]  They'd be like, you're really weird.
[02:22:39.928 --> 02:22:40.528]  What's going on?
[02:22:41.349 --> 02:22:42.810]  They would invite me back and say you're a weirdo.
[02:22:43.330 --> 02:22:52.477]  But I guarantee you, those black mothers that I knew that loved me, I would go over to their house all the time after football and sports and eat dinners and stay over the weekend.
[02:22:52.897 --> 02:22:54.979]  They were all really nice, but man, they didn't like fake people.
[02:22:54.999 --> 02:22:56.360]  And I guarantee you, if I walked in there
[02:22:57.260 --> 02:22:59.641]  And sort of going like, how you doing today?
[02:22:59.681 --> 02:23:00.641]  I'm Fat Albert!
[02:23:00.701 --> 02:23:00.961]  Hey!
[02:23:00.981 --> 02:23:03.862]  They'd be like, why don't you have your dad come pick you up?
[02:23:03.882 --> 02:23:05.403]  Why don't you have your mom come pick you up?
[02:23:05.643 --> 02:23:07.944]  Okay, dumbass.
[02:23:08.244 --> 02:23:12.845]  So, I mean, the black people I know would be major turned off by this.
[02:23:12.905 --> 02:23:16.346]  Why the hell, you're right though, the Democrats, white, black, they're up here just loving it.
[02:23:16.486 --> 02:23:18.187]  Oh God, she's got another fake accent!
[02:23:18.207 --> 02:23:21.488]  I mean, she goes to Detroit and makes up some weird black accent I've never heard.
[02:23:22.048 --> 02:23:23.869]  That's another thing, she's not even good at it, Dom.
[02:23:23.909 --> 02:23:24.709]  What the hell's going on here?
[02:23:25.433 --> 02:23:26.394]  It's actually sad, yeah.
[02:23:26.434 --> 02:23:27.916]  It's just the fact that it can be accepted.
[02:23:28.276 --> 02:23:29.297]  Oh wow, my camera went off.
[02:23:29.357 --> 02:23:32.621]  Yeah, it's just the fact that it's so easily accepted without the backlash.
[02:23:33.502 --> 02:23:36.024]  She doesn't get backlash for the way that she is.
[02:23:36.985 --> 02:23:41.230]  What do you think the people in there watching this are thinking?
[02:23:43.082 --> 02:23:46.223]  I see from a lot of blacks I've talked to, they are actually pretty disrespected by it.
[02:23:46.423 --> 02:23:50.644]  And that tells me that they're reaching their peak of the propaganda that they can push to the people.
[02:23:51.024 --> 02:23:55.066]  Cuz blacks are somewhat very disrespected from it because her past came out of her speaking about it.
[02:23:55.686 --> 02:23:59.507]  She doesn't believe in speaking on black issues by itself.
[02:23:59.547 --> 02:24:00.747]  She doesn't approve reparation.
[02:24:01.187 --> 02:24:03.168]  And she actually identified with her Indian past.
[02:24:03.188 --> 02:24:04.508]  So those things have came out.
[02:24:04.908 --> 02:24:07.309]  And as you were saying, they don't really like fake.
[02:24:07.989 --> 02:24:09.170]  So it's pretty obvious to them.
[02:24:09.190 --> 02:24:09.870]  Now with Obama,
[02:24:11.078 --> 02:24:14.481]  Yeah, leeway because we were in a different time, even though the whole Kenyan thing.
[02:24:15.221 --> 02:24:23.908]  If Obama was, and a lot of people are aware of this, black people in America right now, if Obama was to run now, he would face so much backlash from the Kenyan allegations.
[02:24:24.529 --> 02:24:30.113]  Because black Americans are now reaching a point where there's a huge movement where they are speaking out against the diaspora.
[02:24:30.914 --> 02:24:38.420]  Because they feel like they're being controlled and manipulated by the Democratic Party to, you know, to pretty much give a
[02:24:39.582 --> 02:24:42.823]  Representation of what black is, you'll typically see in Netflix, etc.
[02:24:42.843 --> 02:24:50.725]  And all of these forms of media, they're typically controlled by like black foreigners, or who gets the roles on these Netflix movies are typically black foreigners.
[02:24:51.625 --> 02:24:59.186]  And black Americans, people that's born in America have been rejecting that pretty strongly over the past nine months to two years maximum.
[02:24:59.947 --> 02:25:01.387]  We're just not the country that we were.
[02:25:02.270 --> 02:25:11.697]  The fact that they will reject Barack Obama because of the Kenyan affiliation, there's absolutely no way that Kamala Harris truly has a chance to win to be president.
[02:25:11.757 --> 02:25:13.459]  And they're also alienating the male voter.
[02:25:14.199 --> 02:25:15.980]  They're not upticking the male voter at all.
[02:25:16.481 --> 02:25:20.924]  It messed them up with Hillary Clinton going too far with the feminist thing, the whole I'm with her slogan.
[02:25:21.344 --> 02:25:22.866]  To me, that's not smart.
[02:25:23.446 --> 02:25:27.169]  You're trying to uptick the female voters when they don't need any more of that.
[02:25:27.856 --> 02:25:32.122]  They need more black male voters and white male voters, and they are losing substantially
[02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:55.127]  It's so big that I truly feel like what we're seeing with the migrants, they pushed into full force because they said, well, we wanted to kind of, you know, egg this into the communities maybe three, four years from now.
[02:25:55.168 --> 02:25:55.608]  We've lost.
[02:25:55.648 --> 02:25:57.329]  I feel like it's like this.
[02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:58.090]  We've lost the blacks.
[02:26:12.722 --> 02:26:15.164]  We need to bring in a new truckload immediately.
[02:26:15.345 --> 02:26:19.528]  They've lost the blacks, and it might not appear this way from the outside looking in.
[02:26:19.588 --> 02:26:23.072]  But I'm telling everyone that's listening and watching, it is so much that has changed.
[02:26:23.512 --> 02:26:28.677]  They're actually keeping Democrats accountable right now in California, in Kamala Harris State.
[02:26:29.537 --> 02:26:33.061]  There are black people, I don't even, everyone knows how I feel about a reparation thing.
[02:26:33.721 --> 02:26:35.483]  I'm not really one of those big advocates for it.
[02:26:36.337 --> 02:26:45.041]  But nonetheless, you have a Republican congressman in California advocating for reparations because Democrats told black people they were going to get it.
[02:26:45.561 --> 02:26:48.122]  Democrats in California have pulled back on that promise.
[02:26:48.623 --> 02:26:57.107]  And there have been nonstop protests at California courtrooms and their town halls about this reparation.
[02:26:57.287 --> 02:27:00.008]  And the only person that's standing with them is a Republican congressman.
[02:27:00.774 --> 02:27:03.856]  These are the things that I've been a Republican since six years old.
[02:27:03.997 --> 02:27:07.760]  These were the things that I was hoping our party could start doing because it's about optics.
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:10.001]  We are finally playing the optic game.
[02:27:10.642 --> 02:27:14.745]  We're finally playing the optic game the way Democrats are because the optics of that is just amazing.
[02:27:15.105 --> 02:27:16.847]  That sent ripples through America.
[02:27:17.187 --> 02:27:23.372]  There are black people all across America and all the hoods talking about, man, y'all see how that white Republican talking about reparations?
[02:27:24.552 --> 02:27:32.226]  But they pay attention to this stuff, and they remember this stuff, because the optics, they're saying, man, it's really Democrats that's against us.
[02:27:32.867 --> 02:27:35.191]  They're the ones that's going to promise us something we can't get.
[02:27:36.227 --> 02:27:38.747]  Well, take Trump doubling funding for black colleges.
[02:27:38.787 --> 02:27:42.268]  That's something that actually helps people in black development zones.
[02:27:42.368 --> 02:27:43.808]  I'm all for that, but absolutely.
[02:27:43.828 --> 02:27:47.089]  The Democrats, if they ever do it, it'll be select groups for political control.
[02:27:47.109 --> 02:27:51.110]  It's kind of a universal basic income, but for black folks first for control.
[02:27:51.570 --> 02:27:53.310]  So it's social engineering, but expanding on that.
[02:27:53.650 --> 02:27:57.011]  When Trump says he's going to get rid of tax on tips, he's going to do it.
[02:27:57.591 --> 02:27:59.371]  People can guarantee Kamala's stealing that.
[02:27:59.851 --> 02:28:02.511]  She hired 87,000 new IRS agents.
[02:28:02.531 --> 02:28:05.332]  She honchoed that to actually go after working people.
[02:28:06.243 --> 02:28:06.423]  Yeah.
[02:28:07.384 --> 02:28:07.984]  Yeah, completely.
[02:28:08.664 --> 02:28:18.210]  It's the thing is, he's a candidate that does what he says, and she's the type of candidate she's telling you to vote for her to get her to act on anything.
[02:28:18.903 --> 02:28:19.984]  And it's a complete difference.
[02:28:20.024 --> 02:28:21.265]  I mean, we have track record.
[02:28:21.285 --> 02:28:30.611]  The best thing about this, I still believe that Joe Biden has gained new Republican voters, more Republican voters than Donald Trump did in terms of their presidency.
[02:28:31.031 --> 02:28:35.294]  Only if you compare those four years, I think more people became Republicans to Biden than Trump.
[02:28:35.794 --> 02:28:45.641]  Main reason for that is because if you can go to Google right now, no matter what city you live in, people will only give you a review unless it was the best experience of their life,
[02:28:46.454 --> 02:28:47.535]  All of it was just a bad experience.
[02:28:47.575 --> 02:28:48.536]  It don't even have to be the worst.
[02:28:49.256 --> 02:28:52.900]  You are more likely to get a negative review, or that's anything in life.
[02:28:52.960 --> 02:29:02.087]  It don't even have to be the worst experience, but if it's bad, it's more likely for you to get a review or get someone swayed or action taken if people aren't satisfied.
[02:29:02.488 --> 02:29:08.312]  People aren't satisfied with America, so it calls people to look in, and it calls for people to now start speaking out and give bad reviews.
[02:29:08.333 --> 02:29:11.996]  When people are happy, they have nothing to complain about, so they won't talk most of the time.
[02:29:12.696 --> 02:29:14.518]  Through Joe Biden's failure in America,
[02:29:15.094 --> 02:29:17.938]  We are seeing more black people now leaving these bad reviews.
[02:29:18.459 --> 02:29:19.641]  They are now getting active.
[02:29:19.661 --> 02:29:21.543]  They are now doing research on the company.
[02:29:21.724 --> 02:29:25.189]  They are seeing why they are getting service that they aren't requesting.
[02:29:26.370 --> 02:29:31.418]  Democrats, just the same way as a business, there's too many bad reviews posted on their party right now.
[02:29:32.159 --> 02:29:32.999]  And people are reading them.
[02:29:33.319 --> 02:29:33.839]  Well, that's right.
[02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:34.980]  I think a shift is happening.
[02:29:35.380 --> 02:29:43.782]  You look at Bill Gates or Klaus Schwab on YouTube or Instagram, there'll be 10,000 comments and I'll read for an hour and can't find one comment for them.
[02:29:44.122 --> 02:29:45.402]  And the people are super educated.
[02:29:45.462 --> 02:29:47.983]  So that's where you see the real numbers.
[02:29:48.063 --> 02:29:52.084]  Now, there's four dead, 30 injured there in Georgia at this school.
[02:29:52.444 --> 02:29:54.745]  They say it's a 14-year-old suspect in custody.
[02:29:56.202 --> 02:29:57.844]  We'll continue to track this as it unfolds.
[02:29:58.404 --> 02:30:00.566]  Dom, what else are you expecting?
[02:30:00.586 --> 02:30:02.248]  Because it was either Wednesday or Thursday or Friday.
[02:30:02.268 --> 02:30:04.190]  I think it was Wednesday right after she was on CNN.
[02:30:04.630 --> 02:30:14.599]  I said it's so bad she's got to have some false flag or some big tragic event like a school shooting or blowing up a black college to say both Trumps are racist.
[02:30:15.020 --> 02:30:15.961]  His supporter did it.
[02:30:16.401 --> 02:30:20.265]  They've got to have something like that so she can attack him and say you got people killed.
[02:30:21.697 --> 02:30:24.318]  I mean, that's what they're going to do.
[02:30:24.338 --> 02:30:26.780]  And then he needs to say, I didn't get anybody killed.
[02:30:27.340 --> 02:30:33.545]  And plus, you're the one that smuggled 325,000 kids across the border, many of which are in slave labor and sex slavery.
[02:30:35.126 --> 02:30:37.107]  What do you think you ought to hit her with in the debate?
[02:30:39.429 --> 02:30:40.469]  It's a lot of things they could hit her with.
[02:30:40.509 --> 02:30:43.912]  I would have a hard time seeing how they could blame this on President Trump, even if they
[02:30:44.545 --> 02:30:46.933]  This kid was to come out with a conservative background.
[02:30:47.094 --> 02:30:51.608]  It would be kind of hard to blame deaths on Trump because it would lead to these recent shootings.
[02:30:52.727 --> 02:31:02.814]  Over the past two years that are linked to transgenderism or linked to just liberal ideology as a whole, or even Trump's attempted assassination.
[02:31:03.315 --> 02:31:06.777]  So just bringing that narrative up, I think is a losing battle for Democrats.
[02:31:07.077 --> 02:31:08.338]  They're pretty good with optics.
[02:31:08.358 --> 02:31:12.281]  I don't know if they really want to try that whole mass shooting game this year.
[02:31:12.821 --> 02:31:17.064]  But if they did, I would feel like it would have to be a larger event than the recent one that we've seen.
[02:31:17.932 --> 02:31:19.073]  I don't know.
[02:31:34.446 --> 02:31:41.188]  Over these last four years, and you know the last four years been disastrous, because she's running on a platform to tell people America needs fixing.
[02:31:41.868 --> 02:31:44.229]  She is telling people she is coming to save America.
[02:31:44.889 --> 02:31:46.490]  How can you save America from yourself?
[02:31:46.970 --> 02:31:48.431]  You have been VP for four years.
[02:31:48.551 --> 02:31:52.692]  How can you come and tell the people that you're going to do something better for four more?
[02:31:53.072 --> 02:31:54.512]  It is absolutely absurd.
[02:31:55.453 --> 02:31:58.054]  So the simple fact that she's been VP can help Trump.
[02:31:58.334 --> 02:32:02.075]  All he has to do is compare what it was from his presidency to hers.
[02:32:04.502 --> 02:32:06.123]  What do you make of them suppressing?
[02:32:06.163 --> 02:32:07.103]  What, it's a year and a half?
[02:32:07.163 --> 02:32:09.424]  How long has it been since the big trans shooter?
[02:32:09.444 --> 02:32:10.124]  There's been so many.
[02:32:10.585 --> 02:32:18.708]  Why do you think six of the last seven school shootings, the ones that happened before today, we don't know about today, were trans people and they fought like the devil to cover that up?
[02:32:19.915 --> 02:32:20.916]  I think it's because of the medicine.
[02:32:21.676 --> 02:32:23.878]  A lot of people will say, well, trans people are just sick.
[02:32:23.938 --> 02:32:29.261]  Well, I think it could be the medicine because the problem is Big Pharma has a hand in this.
[02:32:29.801 --> 02:32:34.924]  They're pushing out this medication that changes out their mental capabilities, changes out their mindset.
[02:32:35.385 --> 02:32:38.166]  And it's somewhat that you see like roids.
[02:32:38.767 --> 02:32:39.928]  You can see people with steroids.
[02:32:39.948 --> 02:32:42.169]  There is a correlation between steroids and violence.
[02:32:43.527 --> 02:32:51.579]  There is a correlation between the mental stimulus and the medication and these hormone blockers that they are given to children and violence.
[02:32:52.441 --> 02:32:58.110]  The problem is, just like steroids, if they were to emit this link, it's time to start having
[02:32:59.764 --> 02:33:00.304]  Restrictions.
[02:33:00.885 --> 02:33:08.828]  It would be far more restrictions on this if you could validate that it puts children in a dangerous position health-wise.
[02:33:08.928 --> 02:33:17.072]  Oh, it says on the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which most of them are on as well, not just the hormones, that it can cause megalomania, violence, psychotic outbreaks, and murder.
[02:33:18.613 --> 02:33:18.813]  Wow.
[02:33:20.660 --> 02:33:21.581]  Wow, I didn't know that.
[02:33:35.592 --> 02:33:40.195]  Well, yeah, that's, so, if that, I just feel like that's the main reason why they can't push it out there.
[02:33:40.215 --> 02:33:43.918]  You push it out, people are going to be weary of letting their children take this.
[02:33:44.378 --> 02:33:49.162]  They're going to be weary of their health, and it's going to lead to a significant decrease in the purchases from Big Pharma.
[02:33:49.402 --> 02:33:53.665]  I think more so, it has a lot to do with money, the fact that they aren't ready to lose this cash, Kyle.
[02:33:54.445 --> 02:33:58.688]  I remember when I debated Piers Morgan in 2013, I was supposed to be on the whole hour, they cut it up into segments.
[02:33:59.109 --> 02:34:00.330]  I said, stop blaming gun owners.
[02:34:02.573 --> 02:34:06.076]  I said you have ads on here for suicide mass murder pills.
[02:34:07.738 --> 02:34:08.279]  There it is.
[02:34:08.399 --> 02:34:10.240]  Prozac can make people homicidal.
[02:34:10.581 --> 02:34:11.181]  That is crazy.
[02:34:11.842 --> 02:34:12.602]  It's on the inserts.
[02:34:12.622 --> 02:34:13.964]  It's been on there since like 1997.
[02:34:14.064 --> 02:34:15.905]  It's on all of them.
[02:34:15.925 --> 02:34:16.866]  And that's 19 years old.
[02:34:17.107 --> 02:34:17.727]  That is crazy.
[02:34:17.747 --> 02:34:18.408]  Blue Vox.
[02:34:18.988 --> 02:34:19.289]  All of them.
[02:34:22.699 --> 02:34:26.740]  And they're just giving this to children, children that don't even, it's unfortunate.
[02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:28.060]  It really is a sad situation.
[02:34:28.580 --> 02:34:34.722]  Children are still at such a vulnerable state that they're still trying to identify what their emotions are and who they are.
[02:34:35.282 --> 02:34:44.824]  So if you put something like this in a system and you completely change their natural process of growth, you can end up with a problem.
[02:34:46.189 --> 02:34:49.392]  They're not able to go through the process of being a human.
[02:34:49.673 --> 02:35:00.825]  It's almost like they're taking the human experience away from these children by giving them these medications, by telling them to change their natural biology at such an early age.
[02:35:01.665 --> 02:35:02.927]  It's truly not a human experience.
[02:35:02.947 --> 02:35:07.732]  So I think we could start seeing people act in ways that aren't human.
[02:35:08.306 --> 02:35:09.066]  It wouldn't be a stretch.
[02:35:26.093 --> 02:35:26.714]  A different topic.
[02:35:55.623 --> 02:35:59.768]  Since when does the vice president have what sounds like a southern accent?
[02:35:59.788 --> 02:36:02.891]  You better thank a union member for sick leave!
[02:36:02.911 --> 02:36:05.614]  You better thank a union member for paid leave!
[02:36:05.754 --> 02:36:10.019]  And you all helped us win in 2020 and we're gonna do it again in 2024!
[02:36:10.159 --> 02:36:12.442]  I have no idea what you're talking about.
[02:36:13.171 --> 02:36:20.275]  Well, I mean, this is... She was talking about unions in Detroit, using one tone of voice.
[02:36:20.515 --> 02:36:28.519]  Is this something that you think... Same line... Okay, Peter, let's... She used the same line in Pittsburgh, and it sounded like she at least had some kind of a Southern drawl.
[02:36:28.639 --> 02:36:34.303]  I mean, do you hear the question that you're... I mean, do you think Americans seriously think that this is an important question?
[02:36:34.343 --> 02:36:35.483]  They care... You know what they care about?
[02:36:36.124 --> 02:36:37.104]  They care about the economy.
[02:36:37.724 --> 02:36:38.845]  They care about lowering costs.
[02:36:39.205 --> 02:36:40.206]  They care about healthcare.
[02:36:40.726 --> 02:36:42.146]  That's what Americans care about.
[02:36:42.927 --> 02:36:44.047]  That's what they want to hear.
[02:36:44.067 --> 02:36:50.248]  They care about, your colleague just asked me about what basically we talked about, went back and forth about democracy and freedom.
[02:36:50.948 --> 02:36:52.089]  That's what they care about.
[02:36:52.229 --> 02:36:56.610]  I'm not even going to entertain some question about the president.
[02:36:56.710 --> 02:36:59.730]  It's just, hearing it sounds so ridiculous.
[02:36:59.770 --> 02:37:01.091]  Well, but hearing it is...
[02:37:02.791 --> 02:37:06.314]  The question, I'm talking about the questions, is just insane.
[02:37:06.634 --> 02:37:09.656]  Is that how she talks in meetings here?
[02:37:09.796 --> 02:37:12.398]  I'm just... Peter, we're moving on.
[02:37:12.498 --> 02:37:13.299]  We're so moving on.
[02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:16.241]  We're moving on.
[02:37:16.261 --> 02:37:18.263]  We're so moving on.
[02:37:20.731 --> 02:37:22.111]  Don, let me throw you a curveball.
[02:37:22.231 --> 02:37:30.994]  What do you think would have happened 50 days ago or whatever, close to 50 days ago, on July 13th, if that bullet would have been two millimeters over and hit him in the eye or gone into his head?
[02:37:31.434 --> 02:37:34.775]  What would have happened if his head blew off like Kennedy's in Dallas?
[02:37:35.775 --> 02:37:37.316]  Or if he was a vegetable right now?
[02:37:38.676 --> 02:37:47.459]  I believe what Democrats would have done, it would have been the greatest, I stand by this, the greatest gaslighting campaign the Democratic Party has ever pulled off.
[02:37:47.839 --> 02:37:48.879]  Because in that moment,
[02:37:49.935 --> 02:37:51.456]  They would steal the hell out of the election.
[02:37:51.897 --> 02:37:55.680]  There's nothing that would stop them from taking that election in this country for the next 20, 30 years.
[02:37:56.421 --> 02:37:59.623]  But they would send off President Trump to send off that he finally deserved.
[02:38:00.004 --> 02:38:03.847]  They would treat him, I believe, with so much admiration and respect.
[02:38:04.454 --> 02:38:10.358]  They would shun the shooter, condone it, and lead to more gun restrictions in the name of Trump's death.
[02:38:10.758 --> 02:38:16.382]  It would be, man, I don't even want to even imagine it because the gaslighting would be absolutely insane.
[02:38:16.862 --> 02:38:24.668]  But I could see them leading to more weapon restriction and try to manipulate conservatives into believing and restricting their weapons just from the shooting of Trump.
[02:38:25.388 --> 02:38:26.489]  And they would praise him.
[02:38:26.849 --> 02:38:28.410]  They would mention all the great things he did.
[02:38:28.730 --> 02:38:31.432]  And you would see all Democrat media, I believe in my opinion,
[02:38:33.394 --> 02:38:40.016]  I believe it would have been entirely different.
[02:38:40.317 --> 02:38:46.539]  I think they would have treated Trump like he was a king if he had died because he's not a threat anymore.
[02:38:47.079 --> 02:38:51.581]  And if he's not a threat, the new goal would be to win over his voters because it's possible now.
[02:38:51.921 --> 02:38:55.082]  It is impossible to get a MAGA voter if he's alive.
[02:38:56.451 --> 02:39:04.322]  No one's swaying, but if he was to meet a Demacia, it was a possibility for people that was weak and emotional, they would be able to flip.
[02:39:05.441 --> 02:39:06.221]  They wouldn't have.
[02:39:06.241 --> 02:39:08.282]  That is a super, super sophisticated.
[02:39:08.582 --> 02:39:08.902]  You know what?
[02:39:08.922 --> 02:39:09.843]  I didn't think of that.
[02:39:09.923 --> 02:39:10.723]  But you're right.
[02:39:11.103 --> 02:39:13.524]  I noticed CNN hadn't covered any of his live events.
[02:39:13.564 --> 02:39:14.485]  Suddenly they covered that.
[02:39:14.645 --> 02:39:15.665]  The Secret Service stood down.
[02:39:15.685 --> 02:39:16.325]  We know all that.
[02:39:16.985 --> 02:39:20.687]  And at first they said, oh, he fell down for the first six, seven, eight hours.
[02:39:20.727 --> 02:39:21.827]  They really didn't know what to do.
[02:39:21.847 --> 02:39:22.248]  It didn't kill him.
[02:39:22.268 --> 02:39:22.708]  But you're right.
[02:39:23.188 --> 02:39:24.788]  They would have said, oh, it's so terrible.
[02:39:24.849 --> 02:39:25.709]  It's so sad.
[02:39:25.729 --> 02:39:27.950]  And totally flipped the script on people.
[02:39:27.990 --> 02:39:28.950]  I think you're dead on.
[02:39:29.030 --> 02:39:30.511]  And that's something I admire about you.
[02:39:31.391 --> 02:39:44.756]  I've been following you the last few years and watching you get bigger and bigger, is when somebody starts getting big online because they're smart and people like them, all these trolls attack and even big people attack to see if you'll spend your time responding and get sucked into that.
[02:39:44.776 --> 02:39:48.878]  But you really didn't and ignored all that and the campaigns against you.
[02:39:49.518 --> 02:39:51.019]  And you notice you've gotten an even bigger.
[02:39:51.279 --> 02:39:52.159]  So how are you?
[02:39:53.180 --> 02:39:54.300]  It took me years to learn this.
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:56.701]  I learned most of this, you know, the first decade or so.
[02:39:56.721 --> 02:40:00.543]  I was, uh, you've really kind of seen it and it had a lot of smarts up front.
[02:40:01.747 --> 02:40:04.111]  How were you able to figure that out?
[02:40:05.052 --> 02:40:10.500]  Learning through people like you, as crazy as that might sound and cliche, but actually learning.
[02:40:10.921 --> 02:40:15.708]  The difference is I didn't start my career in this thing, but I started
[02:40:16.539 --> 02:40:16.879]  We're good to
[02:40:39.130 --> 02:40:45.956]  How people that have reached the points that I wanted to reach, just a fraction of their success, and I've seen how they handle situations that I start to relate to.
[02:40:45.976 --> 02:40:49.019]  I'm like, God, this is really depressing that this has happened to me.
[02:40:49.539 --> 02:41:01.609]  And then I'll reference, well, when this happened to Alex and everyone was against him, and when people didn't give him the credit that he deserves, when he exposed things 20, 30 years in advance, it takes this man 15 years to get credit for things.
[02:41:02.610 --> 02:41:06.734]  And it's like, how does this man not let this get to him?
[02:41:07.466 --> 02:41:11.247]  And it's just honestly looking at people like your story and saying that he is bigger.
[02:41:11.267 --> 02:41:12.367]  He can't be stopped.
[02:41:12.427 --> 02:41:16.068]  It don't matter because the work will speak for itself if it's not today.
[02:41:16.088 --> 02:41:22.349]  I mean, you yourself, witnessing your career is what has helped me because it does not matter.
[02:41:22.549 --> 02:41:27.091]  The thing is, if you're putting the work in, all that negativity, it will not outlast the truth.
[02:41:28.011 --> 02:41:33.292]  If you're really genuinely putting the work in, if you're genuinely trying to become better, that will always speak for itself.
[02:41:34.048 --> 02:41:37.829]  The negativity is here today and typically gone tomorrow.
[02:41:38.609 --> 02:41:39.969]  But the real work, it lasts.
[02:41:40.509 --> 02:41:45.010]  I've seen people credit you for things that you've exposed when I was down there in diapers.
[02:41:46.130 --> 02:41:49.651]  That took a long time for people to accept that you've been right for a lot of things.
[02:41:49.911 --> 02:41:51.591]  And you have taken it gracefully.
[02:41:52.252 --> 02:41:53.532]  You've taken the attacks gracefully.
[02:41:53.552 --> 02:41:55.532]  So yeah, just witnessing people like your career.
[02:41:55.812 --> 02:41:59.353]  Well, I didn't know you were going to give me that answer, but that's one of the things I value most is not
[02:42:00.796 --> 02:42:03.078]  It is inspiring people to do a better job than I've done.
[02:42:03.098 --> 02:42:11.163]  And I've always known that if we have real success, people as smart as I am, or smarter in different ways, we're all smarter in different ways, are going to realize this rule of order is real.
[02:42:11.344 --> 02:42:12.144]  It's coming down on us.
[02:42:12.504 --> 02:42:18.629]  And I always thought, and I knew, and I bet on people that we would start to win, and we will win, we have to win.
[02:42:19.469 --> 02:42:24.432]  Because I knew that, it's one thing to tell people before it happens, they're not going to listen then, but I knew they were going to listen when it happened.
[02:42:24.872 --> 02:42:28.654]  And then they'll finally listen before it happens this time, and then we can stop it.
[02:42:28.674 --> 02:42:31.456]  And I think that's what we're, but it's not like people even get information from me.
[02:42:32.016 --> 02:42:34.238]  Tucker said I woke him up, and a lot of other people, Joe Rogan.
[02:42:35.313 --> 02:42:37.655]  It's the issue of they're not seeing what I'm saying.
[02:42:38.055 --> 02:42:43.960]  Once they flip on their eyes and their ears and their soul, they now see from the perspective.
[02:42:43.980 --> 02:42:44.400]  That's all.
[02:42:44.580 --> 02:42:45.861]  It's kind of like those hidden image pictures.
[02:42:45.881 --> 02:42:46.942]  You can't see till you see it.
[02:42:47.303 --> 02:42:53.247]  And once you finally see the butterfly or whatever it is hidden in the spots in the painting, you can't unsee it.
[02:42:53.267 --> 02:42:54.588]  And I'm just like, folks, do you see that?
[02:42:54.608 --> 02:42:55.049]  They're like, no.
[02:42:55.069 --> 02:42:57.411]  I go, look at it a little more carefully from over here.
[02:42:57.471 --> 02:43:01.494]  And all I'm doing is saying, like, Rowdy Piper and They Live, put these glasses on.
[02:43:02.907 --> 02:43:03.628]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:43:03.708 --> 02:43:09.654]  Yeah, it's the same walls that people build up are the ones that get trapped in, and those walls could be Ivy League education.
[02:43:09.714 --> 02:43:13.258]  It could be references from people that you shouldn't trust that you start getting intel from.
[02:43:13.719 --> 02:43:15.520]  It could be mainstream media.
[02:43:16.021 --> 02:43:20.506]  Those walls, and that'll become your credibility, even if you're a journalist.
[02:43:20.566 --> 02:43:23.369]  Those are the walls that you build up, those realities, that perception of reality.
[02:43:23.789 --> 02:43:25.990]  For what you could consider being a fact check.
[02:43:26.010 --> 02:43:35.595]  So if you see news and your three sources is the Ivy League education, mainstream media, and possibly a press release, a presidential press release, your entire reality is skewered.
[02:43:36.015 --> 02:43:41.358]  And you have walls that you built up, that reality that you set, those are the ones that you find yourself trapped in.
[02:43:41.378 --> 02:43:51.563]  And a lot of people, they can't break out those walls, can't break out of those thinking conventions, and can't break out of the narratives that's being presented to them, because their entire reality is built through fake walls.
[02:43:53.274 --> 02:43:55.075]  Well, I've loved seeing Elon boost your stuff.
[02:43:55.095 --> 02:43:55.695]  That's exciting.
[02:43:56.655 --> 02:43:57.476]  That's awesome.
[02:43:57.496 --> 02:44:15.682]  Yeah, he boosted actually, and I think the first creator, he boosted and commented to a YouTube link to a YouTube link to my video, which I mean, I'm still at a loss for words about that because I mean, anyone who knows that my social media, especially with X, you don't really, you're not post to post or promote another social media platform.
[02:44:16.242 --> 02:44:18.023]  So it definitely does show that he's.
[02:44:19.301 --> 02:44:21.222]  He likes my content somewhat.
[02:44:40.293 --> 02:44:42.735]  It's like, we're not in competition, folks, with each other.
[02:44:42.775 --> 02:44:43.915]  We're in competition with the globalists.
[02:44:44.275 --> 02:44:45.696]  If we don't fix this, we're screwed.
[02:44:46.057 --> 02:44:49.499]  So when I see people getting, you know, tens of millions of views a day, I feel good.
[02:44:49.879 --> 02:44:52.881]  I don't feel like, hey, that guy's doing better than me, and people better get their heads screwed on straight.
[02:44:53.361 --> 02:44:54.582]  Dom Luker, we love you.
[02:44:54.622 --> 02:44:58.244]  People should follow you on X at D-O-M underscore L-U-C-R-E.
[02:44:58.664 --> 02:45:00.765]  Thank you so much, and come on more often.
[02:45:01.526 --> 02:45:02.827]  We really appreciate your time.
[02:45:03.567 --> 02:45:03.847]  Thank you.
[02:45:03.887 --> 02:45:04.588]  I love to be here.
[02:45:04.648 --> 02:45:05.209]  Thank you so much.
[02:45:05.249 --> 02:45:06.109]  I really appreciate it.
[02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:07.070]  I really appreciate it.
[02:45:07.250 --> 02:45:07.551]  You bet.
[02:45:07.651 --> 02:45:08.472]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[02:45:08.712 --> 02:45:09.032]  Take care.
[02:45:09.172 --> 02:45:09.993]  God bless you, too, Alex.
[02:45:10.013 --> 02:45:10.393]  Thank you, sir.
[02:45:10.593 --> 02:45:10.994]  There he goes.
[02:45:12.215 --> 02:45:14.897]  And by the way, Dom, feel free to re-upload this interview on Eurex.
[02:45:15.298 --> 02:45:16.198]  I don't care if you even link to me.
[02:45:16.218 --> 02:45:17.079]  I just want to get it out there.
[02:45:17.139 --> 02:45:18.921]  So it'll probably get more views if you upload it, all right?
[02:45:20.356 --> 02:45:20.716]  No problem.
[02:45:20.736 --> 02:45:21.397]  All right, man.
[02:45:21.417 --> 02:45:21.977]  Thank you so much.
[02:45:21.997 --> 02:45:22.677]  We're gonna upload it, too.
[02:45:23.217 --> 02:45:28.160]  All right, now, I've got a big, successful guest coming on, and they got a big company.
[02:45:28.180 --> 02:45:43.368]  They're not a sponsor, they're not paying to be on with us, but I know about their story, and they live in Austin, so I wanted to get this individual, tell you who they are, coming up, on to talk about what the government is doing to him, and it's just disgusting, and it's about hurting you.
[02:45:44.537 --> 02:45:45.657]  It's about hurting you.
[02:45:45.697 --> 02:45:47.038]  It's about keeping you from something.
[02:45:47.058 --> 02:45:50.459]  When they censor you, when they censor me, it's about keeping you from something.
[02:45:50.879 --> 02:45:53.120]  Well, this is the story.
[02:45:54.280 --> 02:45:55.101]  Well, you'll find out.
[02:45:55.441 --> 02:45:56.881]  You'll find out coming up next hour now.
[02:45:57.702 --> 02:45:59.382]  John Bowne goes crazy sometimes in a good way.
[02:45:59.422 --> 02:46:02.203]  He made five reports today, two yesterday.
[02:46:02.663 --> 02:46:07.065]  We got another one of his reports coming up the first five while we get our next special guest in studio.
[02:46:07.725 --> 02:46:09.446]  I'll have more updates on the shooting.
[02:46:09.506 --> 02:46:11.026]  They're still saying four dead, 30 injured.
[02:46:11.046 --> 02:46:12.127]  Thank God the number hasn't gone up.
[02:46:12.887 --> 02:46:13.328]  It's terrible.
[02:46:13.408 --> 02:46:19.594]  And I did say Wednesday, Thursday, repeatedly, there's going to be a mass shooting of some type in a battleground state.
[02:46:19.634 --> 02:46:21.656]  And then Kamala will attack Trump at the debate with that.
[02:46:22.056 --> 02:46:22.897]  And it's happened.
[02:46:22.957 --> 02:46:24.658]  So tomorrow's news today.
[02:46:25.339 --> 02:46:26.841]  We'll be right back with our number four.
[02:46:26.881 --> 02:46:27.461]  I'm hosting it.
[02:46:27.481 --> 02:46:27.922]  Stay with me.
[02:46:28.624 --> 02:46:36.150]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[02:46:36.770 --> 02:46:39.032]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[02:46:39.652 --> 02:46:46.177]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.
[02:46:46.197 --> 02:46:49.760]  And that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[02:46:50.220 --> 02:46:56.384]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,
[02:46:57.285 --> 02:47:05.974]  To double down and support the broadcast more than ever, to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at infowarestore.com.
[02:47:06.174 --> 02:47:15.264]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[02:47:15.644 --> 02:47:16.805]  These are very, very popular.
[02:47:16.845 --> 02:47:17.886]  And I went and looked it up online.
[02:47:18.287 --> 02:47:19.208]  It is very, very popular.
[02:47:19.788 --> 02:47:21.530]  It's not an investment, it's a collectible.
[02:47:21.730 --> 02:47:28.635]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:47:29.096 --> 02:47:33.119]  Best group out there, highest ratings, amazing prices, the best.
[02:47:33.339 --> 02:47:37.402]  This is a collectible and a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[02:47:37.943 --> 02:47:45.669]  Then the bankruptcy started and the people that came in from the court said, we're not going to keep outside people's products in here, in your store.
[02:47:46.770 --> 02:47:47.591]  And they kicked him back.
[02:47:48.709 --> 02:47:52.455]  Uh, to the folks, despite the fact we'd already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[02:47:52.755 --> 02:47:54.618]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company...
[02:47:55.484 --> 02:48:03.906]  And now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[02:48:04.427 --> 02:48:12.829]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[02:48:13.329 --> 02:48:23.512]  Stock up on 24 karat .999 pure gold in the most popular size of one-tenth gram, an affordable, sleek card that fits your wallet, drawer, glove compartment, and is easy to travel with.
[02:48:23.932 --> 02:48:25.433]  They're amazing cards.
[02:48:25.794 --> 02:48:27.615]  It's got original art I came up with.
[02:48:27.695 --> 02:48:30.097]  It's got the little bar of gold in there.
[02:48:30.117 --> 02:48:33.260]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Infowar.
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:39.605]  You'll have a historical memento as a keepsake for yourself, your family, for your children, and your grandchildren.
[02:48:39.625 --> 02:48:41.266]  Because this is a historic fight.
[02:48:41.646 --> 02:48:45.489]  And this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:47.151]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[02:48:47.791 --> 02:48:50.694]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[02:48:51.254 --> 02:48:54.257]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[02:48:54.617 --> 02:48:59.481]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[02:48:59.861 --> 02:49:01.943]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[02:49:02.744 --> 02:49:08.729]  We've only got a few thousand of these left, and I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[02:49:08.769 --> 02:49:09.350]  Now, I want to be clear.
[02:49:09.930 --> 02:49:12.112]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[02:49:12.132 --> 02:49:12.913]  That's not what this is.
[02:49:12.933 --> 02:49:13.954]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[02:49:14.554 --> 02:49:27.664]  This is like, on NPR, that still gives taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug that costs them $5, or a baseball cap that costs them $10, and you make a $100 donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the new world order.
[02:49:27.944 --> 02:49:28.864]  I know you don't want to do that.
[02:49:29.585 --> 02:49:34.408]  This costs, I think they told me, more than $10 per card, something like that, $10 or $11, and so the other
[02:49:37.362 --> 02:49:39.946]  $80-something will go to fund the operation.
[02:49:39.986 --> 02:49:43.130]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[02:49:43.671 --> 02:49:51.361]  So, get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[02:49:51.721 --> 02:49:52.823]  The decision is yours.
[02:49:52.843 --> 02:49:54.245]  This is a limited edition.
[02:49:54.865 --> 02:49:59.209]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[02:49:59.889 --> 02:50:10.198]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, and myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[02:50:10.558 --> 02:50:19.466]  So please take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars limited edition proprietary 24 karat 999 pure gold collectible.
[02:50:19.846 --> 02:50:20.727]  Thank you for your support.
[02:50:21.067 --> 02:50:22.729]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[02:50:31.516 --> 02:50:33.437]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:50:34.037 --> 02:50:34.497]  A lie!
[02:50:34.917 --> 02:50:36.598]  No man is obsolete!
[02:50:37.018 --> 02:50:38.979]  Is the individual obsolete?
[02:50:39.599 --> 02:50:43.961]  Everything I said 20 years ago, but see now they think it's too late.
[02:50:44.001 --> 02:50:47.843]  They think you've adopted it, so now they'll tell you all about it.
[02:50:48.403 --> 02:50:52.765]  You walk into this room at your own risk, because it leads to the future.
[02:50:53.525 --> 02:50:55.826]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[02:50:56.987 --> 02:50:57.887]  This is not a new world.
[02:50:59.227 --> 02:51:02.491]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[02:51:03.632 --> 02:51:11.121]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[02:51:12.062 --> 02:51:16.608]  It has refinements, technological advances, and a more sophisticated approach.
[02:51:18.396 --> 02:51:33.424]  My big crime wasn't all the fake reasons they gave for taking me off all those platforms.
[02:51:33.965 --> 02:51:35.125]  It was that I was successful.
[02:51:35.245 --> 02:51:35.946]  I was effective.
[02:51:35.986 --> 02:51:36.706]  You were effective.
[02:51:37.007 --> 02:51:39.468]  We were relaunching Americana, not just here, but worldwide.
[02:51:39.588 --> 02:51:58.742]  The CIA's 1953 research budget allotted roughly $10 million to be dedicated to human experimentation involving hypnosis and amnesia, utilizing the effects of heroin, morphine, barbiturates, amphetamines, LSD, BZ, scopolamine, and other hallucination-causing compounds.
[02:51:58.902 --> 02:52:11.731]  Now, due to the unyielding efforts of John Greenwald, founder of the document archive website TheBlackVault.com, we are learning that the notorious MKUltra research was just scraping the surface.
[02:52:11.931 --> 02:52:15.814]  Everything has been kind of lumped into this mind control MKUltra program.
[02:52:16.574 --> 02:52:26.877]  What these thousands of pages that I just received and put online at theblackball.com, what they prove is we do not have the full story.
[02:52:27.217 --> 02:52:38.300]  What they prove is MKUltra was just simply the tip of the iceberg, that there was a heck of a lot more going on, that there are project names that are still redacted.
[02:52:38.900 --> 02:52:44.783]  And why that's important is, according to the CIA, they've kind of quote-unquote released everything to us.
[02:52:45.283 --> 02:52:47.585]  So investigators have had these for years.
[02:52:48.225 --> 02:52:50.906]  But what these prove is that's not entirely true.
[02:52:51.707 --> 02:53:02.312]  And these documents show that they were not even related to MKUltra, but they were doing experiments where they are implanting devices, and they started with dogs.
[02:53:02.432 --> 02:53:05.294]  And Newsweek wrote this up, did a great job with it.
[02:53:05.934 --> 02:53:12.757]  That they were implanting these things in dog brains and were able to control dogs and have success with it.
[02:53:13.278 --> 02:53:15.319]  Now, you might think, well, that's just dogs.
[02:53:15.359 --> 02:53:15.799]  Who cares?
[02:53:15.839 --> 02:53:19.581]  Well, this was the tip of the iceberg when it came to that research.
[02:53:19.661 --> 02:53:20.541]  What comes next?
[02:53:21.021 --> 02:53:24.423]  We've had tens of thousands of military volunteer.
[02:53:24.983 --> 02:53:26.624]  They got guys that will volunteer to go on suicide missions.
[02:53:26.644 --> 02:53:27.404]  They've already volunteered.
[02:53:27.424 --> 02:53:28.085]  They've already done it all.
[02:53:28.905 --> 02:53:30.966]  I know people that got recruited into these programs.
[02:53:30.986 --> 02:53:32.607]  I know people that refused the programs.
[02:53:32.647 --> 02:53:44.613]  But they, in the 80s, they already had giant, literal underground facilities in Maryland where they were creating all sorts of people, let's just say, that could infiltrate things with hidden devices in their bodies.
[02:53:44.893 --> 02:53:57.402]  As a republic that fought valiantly to end the horror of the Nazi regime and its experimentation on humanity, why in the world do we continue to allow this research to prey on our fellow citizens?
[02:53:57.702 --> 02:54:01.665]  We can see the seduction by big corporations and governments of the internet.
[02:54:03.083 --> 02:54:08.427]  We're for its first 20 years or so of it being popularized and being used on mass scale.
[02:54:08.968 --> 02:54:10.409]  It had been around for decades before that.
[02:54:11.109 --> 02:54:19.516]  But by the time it became popularized in the early 90s to the mid 90s, whatever was most popular, whatever people voted up went to the top.
[02:54:20.157 --> 02:54:24.801]  And you usually get really good answers from whatever was at the top of Google and other systems.
[02:54:26.027 --> 02:54:33.792]  And it was a thing where we communicated together and we promoted Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and we put our content on YouTube.
[02:54:34.112 --> 02:54:34.792]  It's about you.
[02:54:36.594 --> 02:54:53.304]  But as soon as they had gathered us all together, as soon as they'd gotten us under their control, then they enslaved us to the one central AI grid that is now setting the parameters of being able to have access to the Internet.
[02:54:54.440 --> 02:55:01.265]  And waging war against the pockets of the still free internet and monopolistically buying up all their competition.
[02:55:02.466 --> 02:55:05.749]  This is a post-freedom worldwide tyranny.
[02:55:05.849 --> 02:55:11.233]  It is the great threat of the current time we live in and existentially into the future.
[02:55:11.874 --> 02:55:16.617]  It is the challenge not just of our time or our age,
[02:55:17.637 --> 02:55:20.479]  But of the entire human condition.
[02:55:21.100 --> 02:55:24.482]  Kamala Harris has already seized upon the Georgia shooting with four dead at the school.
[02:55:24.883 --> 02:55:26.024]  She's set to speak in minutes.
[02:55:26.584 --> 02:55:31.608]  Live coverage here in the fourth hour of the tragic shooting a little bit north of Atlanta, Georgia.
[02:55:32.508 --> 02:55:35.171]  Kamala Harris has seized upon the attack.
[02:55:36.071 --> 02:55:37.992]  And it's going to be attacking Trump during the debate.
[02:55:38.052 --> 02:55:41.514]  We have the clip where I predicted last week bombings or mass shootings.
[02:55:42.554 --> 02:55:48.857]  Perfectly timed so she can attack Trump at the debate on the 10th that we'll be covering live and magically always before an election.
[02:55:49.377 --> 02:55:49.998]  It starts up.
[02:55:50.178 --> 02:55:53.980]  I would imagine we'll probably see four or five more mass shootings in the next 61 days.
[02:55:54.940 --> 02:55:55.501]  We're good to go.
[02:56:11.232 --> 02:56:12.633]  Welcome to CNN News Central.
[02:56:12.693 --> 02:56:16.296]  I'm Brianna Keeler alongside Boris Sanchez, and we are following breaking news.
[02:56:16.396 --> 02:56:18.298]  At least four people are dead.
[02:56:18.518 --> 02:56:23.422]  Nine others have been taken to hospitals after a school shooting in Winder, Georgia.
[02:56:23.482 --> 02:56:26.705]  This is about 45 minutes or an hour northeast of Atlanta.
[02:56:27.105 --> 02:56:30.308]  And authorities say the suspect is in custody, is alive.
[02:56:30.688 --> 02:56:37.254]  Sources telling us he is a 14-year-old boy, but it's unclear if he attended Appalachee High School.
[02:56:37.594 --> 02:56:40.156]  The shooting happened around 9 30 a.m.
[02:56:40.196 --> 02:56:40.636]  this morning.
[02:56:40.676 --> 02:56:55.007]  That's when the 911 calls started coming in there from the high school in Barrow County and aerial footage of the campus showing students actually forming right here in the end zone of the football field a prayer circle.
[02:56:55.487 --> 02:56:58.189]  Right now authorities are working to reunite students with their families.
[02:56:58.210 --> 02:56:59.411]  Many describing it as a terrifying moment.
[02:56:59.471 --> 02:57:01.673]  Alright, let's cut from this to Kamala Harris.
[02:57:01.793 --> 02:57:04.155]  She has now just walked out on the stage.
[02:57:05.056 --> 02:57:06.877]  All of this very interesting timing.
[02:57:06.957 --> 02:57:07.458]  Here it is.
[02:57:07.478 --> 02:57:15.705]  Oh my goodness!
[02:57:16.606 --> 02:57:20.269]  Can we hear it for Nicole and Throwback Brewing?
[02:57:25.137 --> 02:57:26.518]  She is the definition of cringe.
[02:57:26.538 --> 02:57:28.339]  I wonder what voice she'll have today.
[02:57:30.721 --> 02:57:31.322]  Hi, guys.
[02:57:31.822 --> 02:57:32.583]  Thank you.
[02:57:32.723 --> 02:57:33.443]  Thank you.
[02:57:33.583 --> 02:57:35.185]  Thank you all.
[02:57:35.285 --> 02:57:36.145]  Thank you all.
[02:57:36.245 --> 02:57:36.786]  Thank you.
[02:57:36.866 --> 02:57:37.466]  Thank you.
[02:57:37.526 --> 02:57:37.927]  Thank you.
[02:57:37.987 --> 02:57:38.467]  Thank you.
[02:57:38.567 --> 02:57:39.108]  Thank you.
[02:57:39.208 --> 02:57:39.748]  Thank you.
[02:57:39.808 --> 02:57:40.208]  Thank you.
[02:57:40.288 --> 02:57:42.530]  It's so good to be back in New Hampshire.
[02:57:42.951 --> 02:57:44.051]  Thank you all.
[02:57:44.752 --> 02:57:45.392]  Where's the voice?
[02:57:45.593 --> 02:57:47.554]  Gonna play here in Georgia, everybody.
[02:57:48.014 --> 02:57:50.076]  And Doug sends his love to everyone.
[02:57:50.116 --> 02:57:50.716]  Oh, she's in Detroit.
[02:57:50.756 --> 02:57:51.877]  How's my doing today?
[02:57:51.957 --> 02:57:52.638]  I'm in Detroit.
[02:57:54.885 --> 02:57:56.166]  Oh, thank you everyone.
[02:57:56.186 --> 02:57:57.327]  Nicole, thank you.
[02:57:57.347 --> 02:57:59.348]  You guys are just so extraordinary.
[02:57:59.368 --> 02:58:02.570]  Now she's going to have to switch character and get into the shooting and be very sad.
[02:58:02.730 --> 02:58:05.711]  And the love that you do in giving community.
[02:58:05.852 --> 02:58:07.553]  I love our small business owners.
[02:58:07.773 --> 02:58:08.713]  It is what you do.
[02:58:08.773 --> 02:58:17.258]  I'm going to talk a bit about you in a minute, but you are part of the fabric, the essential fabric of a community that cares about one another.
[02:58:17.378 --> 02:58:18.379]  Thank you for everything.
[02:58:22.566 --> 02:58:28.808]  And thank you to the outstanding congressional delegation, Senator Shaheen Hassan.
[02:58:30.509 --> 02:58:36.271]  Well, they said she was going to respond, but we'll see if that happens.
[02:58:36.731 --> 02:58:38.192]  And all the leaders who are here today.
[02:58:38.212 --> 02:58:43.274]  She should have said it's good to be here, appreciate you being here before she had some grave news.
[02:58:43.354 --> 02:58:44.174]  Thank you everyone.
[02:58:44.194 --> 02:58:45.214]  Now she's about to switch character.
[02:58:45.375 --> 02:58:45.895]  Thank you.
[02:58:49.844 --> 02:59:00.048]  So before I begin, I do want to say a few words about this tragic shooting that took place this morning in Winder, Georgia.
[02:59:00.528 --> 02:59:02.909]  We're still gathering information about what happened.
[02:59:02.929 --> 02:59:07.071]  But we know that there were multiple fatalities and injuries.
[02:59:10.253 --> 02:59:14.737]  You know, our hearts are with all the students, the teachers, and their families, of course.
[02:59:15.478 --> 02:59:19.382]  And we are grateful to the first responders in the- This is all you're gonna hear in the debate.
[02:59:19.522 --> 02:59:21.344]  But this is just a senseless tragedy.
[02:59:22.125 --> 02:59:24.327]  On top of so many senseless tragedies.
[02:59:24.867 --> 02:59:26.088]  And it's just outrageous.
[02:59:27.113 --> 02:59:39.219]  That every day in our country, in the United States of America, that parents have to send their children to school worried about whether or not their child will come home alive.
[02:59:40.200 --> 02:59:41.700]  It's senseless.
[02:59:42.061 --> 02:59:43.041]  We've got to stop it.
[02:59:43.061 --> 02:59:48.004]  Kind of like the 325,000 kids you smuggled across in slave labor and sex slavery?
[02:59:48.124 --> 02:59:51.665]  You know, it doesn't have to be this way.
[02:59:52.206 --> 02:59:54.087]  It doesn't have to be this way.
[02:59:55.501 --> 03:00:00.367]  So we will continue, of course, to send our prayers and our thoughts to the families.
[03:00:02.165 --> 03:00:06.467]  All those who were affected, including, you know, I I'm going off script right now.
[03:00:06.587 --> 03:00:19.114]  But listen, I mean, you know, at the last year, I started a college tour and I traveled our country meeting with our young leaders.
[03:00:19.174 --> 03:00:19.314]  Right.
[03:00:19.334 --> 03:00:21.235]  And so it was college age young leaders.
[03:00:21.255 --> 03:00:24.116]  So I did trade schools, colleges, universities, community colleges.
[03:00:24.476 --> 03:00:26.558]  By the way, I love Gen Z. I just love Gen Z.
[03:00:28.795 --> 03:00:31.851]  Alright folks, so she's just switching back and forth in her character.
[03:00:34.255 --> 03:00:38.836]  Every time I went to the auditorium and it would be filled with these young leader students.
[03:00:38.856 --> 03:00:39.296]  That's enough.
[03:00:39.636 --> 03:00:42.257]  So we knew that was going to happen and you just watched the debate.
[03:00:42.657 --> 03:00:44.658]  So they found one of the clips from Wednesday.
[03:00:44.758 --> 03:00:48.999]  I know I elaborated Thursday or Friday and said mass shootings or power outages, cyber attacks.
[03:00:49.639 --> 03:00:53.120]  They may even cancel the debate with some big crisis because she can't debate.
[03:00:53.500 --> 03:00:55.600]  She's taped for hours at CNN.
[03:00:56.040 --> 03:00:57.401]  They only put out 20 something minutes.
[03:00:57.521 --> 03:00:59.841]  She's like squatting down like a little kid at the table.
[03:01:00.441 --> 03:01:01.962]  She has major performance anxiety.
[03:01:02.970 --> 03:01:10.856]  She can't talk unless there's a teleprompter, but she can sit there and say, it's your fault kids were killed, or it's your fault that some, you know, supporter of yours just blew something up.
[03:01:11.677 --> 03:01:13.158]  So here I am on the 30th.
[03:01:14.199 --> 03:01:15.520]  That's just five days ago.
[03:01:16.161 --> 03:01:20.224]  Alex Jones predicted imminent bombing or shooting last week ahead of Trump-Harris debate.
[03:01:21.144 --> 03:01:22.265]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[03:01:22.305 --> 03:01:22.586]  Here it is.
[03:01:23.424 --> 03:01:31.793]  The next 11 days, this debate will show the world that she has to steal the election, that she'll never win, that she's not ahead in the polls, that it's all a fraud.
[03:01:31.833 --> 03:01:34.576]  I mean, already to see an interview is devastating.
[03:01:35.096 --> 03:01:35.677]  But again, it's just...
[03:01:37.639 --> 03:01:41.641]  I'm not saying shoot her, it's an analogy, but it's like, she's already been shot politically a hundred times.
[03:01:42.161 --> 03:01:44.823]  She's just a blob of bloody flesh, politically.
[03:01:45.163 --> 03:01:50.126]  Do we need to see her shot politically, metaphorically, a thousand more times?
[03:01:51.186 --> 03:01:57.710]  But that's what's gonna happen in the self-immolation that is this event coming up on the 10th.
[03:01:57.770 --> 03:01:58.590]  I mean, I can't wait.
[03:01:58.990 --> 03:02:00.391]  It's like Christmas or something's coming.
[03:02:00.611 --> 03:02:03.513]  But then I ask myself, this is do or die for them.
[03:02:05.649 --> 03:02:16.739]  Are they about to truck bomb a black college or shoot up a black church or something like that and say it's a Trump supporter like two days before?
[03:02:18.060 --> 03:02:19.822]  Maybe on the 9th?
[03:02:23.705 --> 03:02:24.326]  Just wondering.
[03:02:25.287 --> 03:02:26.588]  Because if I was them, that's what I'd do.
[03:02:26.988 --> 03:02:27.609]  I wouldn't do that.
[03:02:27.629 --> 03:02:30.912]  I'm not immoral, but I get in their mindset and I can think like them.
[03:02:34.512 --> 03:02:40.414]  Or maybe there's a cyber attack before this so they can't have the debate, because I don't believe she agreed to this debate.
[03:02:42.694 --> 03:02:45.715]  All right, that's one of the clips, and there's another one where I say, specifically school shootings.
[03:02:45.735 --> 03:02:47.815]  We'll find it, but look, we'll see what happens.
[03:02:47.835 --> 03:02:48.516]  It always happens.
[03:02:49.436 --> 03:02:52.597]  It's very political, very, very magical, very, very sad that this continues to happen.
[03:02:52.917 --> 03:02:53.657]  Now joining us...
[03:02:54.815 --> 03:03:00.916]  Is a real bird's eye view from industry of what happened during the last four and a half years of COVID suppression.
[03:03:00.936 --> 03:03:02.357]  They've now lost court cases.
[03:03:02.757 --> 03:03:18.541]  They've now had CDC and FDA lawyers admit that they suppressed ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine when they knew it was good and paid two plus billion dollars to pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens not to prescribe it when doctors prescribed it.
[03:03:19.001 --> 03:03:22.201]  Now they're your doctor, not your doctor, even though it's totally legal for your doctor to do that.
[03:03:22.602 --> 03:03:24.182]  But I remember Dr. Peter McCullough,
[03:03:25.242 --> 03:03:42.308]  And others going back three, four years ago saying, listen, we have hundreds of studies and him showing them on screen that very simple nasal sprays, because the virus first incubates and grows and then gets its first replication up in the nasal cavity and in the lower sinus.
[03:03:43.088 --> 03:03:46.189]  And so, you know, neti potting with salt, but also xylitol things.
[03:03:46.249 --> 03:03:46.949]  I'm not the scientist.
[03:03:46.969 --> 03:03:48.070]  We've got a guy here to explain it all.
[03:03:48.570 --> 03:03:49.270]  We'll clean that out.
[03:03:49.310 --> 03:03:50.630]  So I'm not selling these products.
[03:03:51.171 --> 03:03:52.031]  He's not a sponsor.
[03:03:53.138 --> 03:03:55.020]  He's been in major fights with the federal government.
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:04:00.244]  He has been engaging them all because they don't want you to know not just his nasal spray.
[03:04:00.264 --> 03:04:00.785]  He's a great guy.
[03:04:00.805 --> 03:04:06.510]  He brought all these other nasal sprays and the same thing just to let you know something that could give you a major leg up.
[03:04:06.530 --> 03:04:09.593]  I mean according to McCullough it's like a 90-something percent reduction chance.
[03:04:09.953 --> 03:04:14.597]  You just do this a few times a day when you're on an airplane or places where you're inhaling all these viruses.
[03:04:14.677 --> 03:04:14.837]  So
[03:04:15.618 --> 03:04:19.041]  He brought all these documents in a huge folder of transcripts and depositions.
[03:04:19.581 --> 03:04:21.703]  Nathan Jones lives right here in Austin, Texas as well.
[03:04:22.084 --> 03:04:25.847]  He's the founder and owner of Clear with an X. X-L-E-A-R.
[03:04:25.867 --> 03:04:26.988]  You're going to love that.
[03:04:27.388 --> 03:04:31.211]  The popular over-the-counter xylitol solution for your sinus problems.
[03:04:31.592 --> 03:04:35.935]  After studying university and working as a commercial diver, Nathan Jones started Clear Inc.
[03:04:36.135 --> 03:04:39.658]  to produce and distribute his father's patented xylitol nasal spray.
[03:04:39.919 --> 03:04:41.520]  I work with my dad with stuff he's developed, too.
[03:04:41.560 --> 03:04:42.000]  He's a doctor.
[03:04:42.020 --> 03:04:43.061]  Is that your dad over there?
[03:04:43.081 --> 03:04:43.702]  He looks pretty young.
[03:04:44.182 --> 03:04:52.524]  And he goes, the company quickly found success and grew to having three brands, Clear Sinus Care, Spray Dental Defense, and Natural Sweeteners.
[03:04:52.924 --> 03:04:56.765]  In 2008, Utah Business awarded Nathan with the Entrepreneur of the Year Award.
[03:04:56.805 --> 03:05:08.588]  Nathan talks about the positive dental and health benefits of Xylitol, which I'm always hearing from scientists, it's so wonderful, how clinicians can incorporate Xylitol into their practices, and why the FTC has been suing his company.
[03:05:09.048 --> 03:05:14.351]  Nathan believes that there is a coordinated effort to get rid of supplements and push more people to pharma products.
[03:05:14.571 --> 03:05:16.312]  xler.com.
[03:05:16.772 --> 03:05:17.452]  Great to have you.
[03:05:17.472 --> 03:05:19.894]  You brought a lot of documentation, so take it away.
[03:05:19.934 --> 03:05:28.778]  This is a microcosm, but also a macrocosm, of how they're keeping you from protecting yourself and making your choices like your lobotomized five-year-old.
[03:05:29.038 --> 03:05:29.499]  Mr. Jones?
[03:05:30.239 --> 03:05:31.540]  Well, thank you for having me here, Alex.
[03:05:32.081 --> 03:05:38.968]  And I know you're all about showing, um, you know, putting a little bit of a spotlight, shining light on corruption and conspiracies and all this.
[03:05:39.308 --> 03:05:49.639]  And really what's happened the last four years, especially with us and the whole concept of nasal hygiene, you actually started talking about a little bit, uh, nasal saline, um, nasal neti pots and all that.
[03:05:50.240 --> 03:05:50.380]  But
[03:05:51.571 --> 03:06:00.844]  Whether or not COVID was lab, well we all know it was, came out of a lab, whether it was intentionally let out, whatever it was, it still should have been a simple flash in the pan.
[03:06:01.184 --> 03:06:06.211]  Because our public health agencies knew how to stop it, and they chose not to.
[03:06:06.812 --> 03:06:13.855]  They had studies, so before COVID came around, they've been talking about using these saline irrigations for respiratory coronavirus infections.
[03:06:13.995 --> 03:06:22.539]  It was on the CDC's webpage that if you had a respiratory coronavirus infection, to use saline irrigation to wash it out, to reduce the viral load in your nose.
[03:06:23.100 --> 03:06:25.701]  Most of the time when people get sick, it's right there.
[03:06:26.021 --> 03:06:26.781]  You're breathing it in.
[03:06:26.801 --> 03:06:29.843]  So you've been following CDC directives, but they sued you?
[03:06:30.063 --> 03:06:30.323]  Correct.
[03:06:30.783 --> 03:06:31.003]  That's
[03:06:50.498 --> 03:06:55.582]  University of Tennessee, where they actually had people who had COVID use saline irrigation.
[03:06:56.422 --> 03:06:58.203]  Not any xylitol, not anything else.
[03:06:58.524 --> 03:07:04.548]  Just, sorry, my bad, Vanderbilt University, where they actually just rinsed them out with saline.
[03:07:04.868 --> 03:07:06.569]  All of the patients were better than under a week.
[03:07:06.889 --> 03:07:15.315]  You would have thought that this would have been great news that the CDC, that the Surgeon General, that public health officials would have actually gone out and talked about it, but they didn't.
[03:07:15.335 --> 03:07:17.857]  In fact, they told us not to, okay?
[03:07:18.587 --> 03:07:32.457]  There's other studies that were done following that one where they actually show that people who used saline irrigation after they had COVID were eight times, not eight percent, they were eight times less likely to be hospitalized and die from COVID.
[03:07:32.997 --> 03:07:37.100]  Again, you would have thought the government would come out and talk about it, but they didn't.
[03:07:37.621 --> 03:07:40.143]  There were other studies where they talked about using iodine.
[03:07:40.163 --> 03:07:42.704]  There were other studies where they talked about using xylitol.
[03:07:43.665 --> 03:07:47.208]  All of these studies that the FTC and other agencies wouldn't talk about.
[03:07:48.217 --> 03:08:03.382]  We actually started the company 25 years ago now, in 2000, when my dad, who is a physician, actually started mixing xylitol into saline to wash bacteria out of the nose of infants who were getting these recurrent ear infections.
[03:08:03.823 --> 03:08:04.363]  And he did that.
[03:08:05.023 --> 03:08:13.128]  Because he'd read a study that talked about how xylitol blocked adhesion of strep pneumo, H flu, MCAT, the bacteria that cause a lot of these upper respiratory infections.
[03:08:13.729 --> 03:08:18.272]  He read that and said, hey, if it's blocking adhesion, why don't we wash out their nose?
[03:08:18.592 --> 03:08:19.693]  So he started using it.
[03:08:20.013 --> 03:08:20.853]  It worked like a champ.
[03:08:21.434 --> 03:08:22.795]  And that's how the company got started.
[03:08:23.215 --> 03:08:28.198]  We had never actually thought about looking at viruses, which, shame on us, we probably should have.
[03:08:28.739 --> 03:08:30.880]  But after 20 years, when COVID came in 2020,
[03:08:32.830 --> 03:08:38.180]  We had a couple of doctors say they were having success using our nasal spray on COVID patients.
[03:08:38.220 --> 03:08:40.885]  And so we did what you do when you're a company.
[03:08:41.165 --> 03:08:42.127]  We had studies done.
[03:08:43.701 --> 03:08:49.362]  And the very first one that was done was actually done by the University of Tennessee.
[03:08:49.382 --> 03:08:50.583]  That's where I got it mixed up earlier.
[03:08:50.983 --> 03:09:02.045]  Where they actually showed that xylitol and iota carrageenan, which is a seaweed extract, but those seaweed extract and xylitol both block the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to adhere to the tissue.
[03:09:02.685 --> 03:09:05.866]  And the government came back to us and said, no, you can't use that study either.
[03:09:07.267 --> 03:09:08.368]  Because it's not human airway.
[03:09:08.448 --> 03:09:11.670]  No, so, the pharmacy... And we know now why it's come out in Congress.
[03:09:12.251 --> 03:09:21.938]  They were directed, billions were paid to the pharmacies, saying nothing works, whether it's over-the-counter, whether it's off-label, prescription by a doctor.
[03:09:22.578 --> 03:09:23.799]  It's all normal and standard.
[03:09:24.259 --> 03:09:25.040]  Only shots.
[03:09:25.100 --> 03:09:26.240]  There's no hope but shots.
[03:09:26.300 --> 03:09:27.501]  Even before the shots were out.
[03:09:27.821 --> 03:09:29.222]  And then it turns out the shots don't work.
[03:09:29.262 --> 03:09:30.123]  They erase your immune system.
[03:09:30.143 --> 03:09:35.506]  So premeditated Big Pharma giving orders to control the industry and consumers.
[03:09:35.906 --> 03:09:37.567]  Literally an Iraqitarian conspiracy.
[03:09:38.067 --> 03:09:38.347]  Correct.
[03:09:38.747 --> 03:09:46.770]  And right here, these are actually three warning letters that were actually sent by the FTC to companies in the saline business.
[03:09:47.350 --> 03:09:54.712]  After all of these studies had been done showing how effective saline was, the FTC sent warning letters to NeilMed, competitor of ours.
[03:09:55.012 --> 03:09:57.093]  They sent it to Navage, competitor of ours.
[03:09:57.453 --> 03:10:00.454]  They sent them to us, telling us not to share the data.
[03:10:01.874 --> 03:10:06.658]  I mean, I'm sad that Neil Mead and Navaj didn't stand up and say, hey, the study is the study.
[03:10:06.678 --> 03:10:07.679]  The science is the science.
[03:10:07.739 --> 03:10:08.180]  It works.
[03:10:08.580 --> 03:10:09.761]  We're in the middle of a pandemic.
[03:10:09.781 --> 03:10:16.147]  Can we please talk to people and help them learn how to use nasal hygiene to reduce the severity of their illness?
[03:10:16.167 --> 03:10:19.209]  And just to interrupt, I remember Dr. McCullough years ago saying it and showing it.
[03:10:19.710 --> 03:10:25.695]  Did they ever take it off the CDC website and the NIH website saying use Xylitol or saline solution to clean your nose out?
[03:10:25.955 --> 03:10:28.758]  That it does massive things to block viral replication?
[03:10:29.810 --> 03:10:31.292]  Well, yes they did.
[03:10:31.632 --> 03:10:40.282]  When we pointed it out to the FTC that it was on the CDC's webpage, about two weeks later it was taken off of the CDC's webpage.
[03:10:40.322 --> 03:10:43.265]  Because the same thing happened with hydroxychloroquine.
[03:10:43.886 --> 03:10:44.106]  Yeah.
[03:10:44.687 --> 03:10:46.028]  So it's the same thing.
[03:10:46.088 --> 03:10:49.712]  It's a coordinated... I mean, I used to not believe in conspiracy theories that much.
[03:10:50.535 --> 03:10:59.002]  I do agree 9-11 was a conspiracy, but in the last four years, this whole thing seems like a big conspiracy.
[03:10:59.022 --> 03:10:59.742]  Well, you've been living it.
[03:11:00.022 --> 03:11:00.763]  Yes, we have.
[03:11:01.984 --> 03:11:08.429]  One of the things that I want to point out is, I don't believe that government agencies are evil.
[03:11:08.469 --> 03:11:11.131]  I think that the people that are in them corrupt them and make them evil.
[03:11:11.271 --> 03:11:16.053]  Yeah, it's like if you have an airplane hijacked by a hijacker, the airplane's not bad, the airline's not bad, it's the hijacker.
[03:11:16.093 --> 03:11:16.813]  That's not the captain.
[03:11:16.973 --> 03:11:17.433]  That's correct.
[03:11:17.934 --> 03:11:25.337]  And so the people who are sending all these warning letters, it's the same people, it's the same group of people in the FTC that are sending these warning letters out.
[03:11:26.057 --> 03:11:28.418]  Richard Cleland, Serena Biswanathan, all of these people.
[03:11:28.778 --> 03:11:33.220]  And the interesting part, and I'll get back to all of the studies, is when we were deposing them,
[03:11:33.900 --> 03:11:38.024]  All of them had one thing in common in that they acknowledged that they never read the studies.
[03:11:38.485 --> 03:11:41.407]  We could have sent them any study, and they wouldn't have cared.
[03:11:41.808 --> 03:11:45.011]  They actually said it wasn't on the news, so it couldn't be true.
[03:11:45.171 --> 03:11:51.938]  Well, as you know, the FDA and CDC say, you can't use your company's, whether it's medical or supplements, somebody else's study.
[03:11:51.958 --> 03:11:52.778]  You've got to do your own.
[03:11:53.059 --> 03:11:56.542]  So you go out and do your own, backing up what all the other studies show, and you're still bad.
[03:11:57.043 --> 03:11:57.283]  Correct.
[03:11:58.188 --> 03:12:09.277]  And that's what they're trying to do, is they're trying to make it so that each and every supplement company has to go do their own study on their own branded product, on their own blend, which is something they don't even require drug companies to do.
[03:12:10.158 --> 03:12:16.002]  And that's going to drive the cost of your supplements so high... They didn't even do testing of their mRNA shot beforehand!
[03:12:16.203 --> 03:12:16.583]  That's true.
[03:12:17.697 --> 03:12:18.137]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:12:18.157 --> 03:12:19.098]  It's insane.
[03:12:19.818 --> 03:12:28.422]  So anyways, so getting back to some of these studies, this was a study that was done at the University of Tennessee where they actually looked at iotacarrageen and they looked at xylitol.
[03:12:28.662 --> 03:12:31.364]  What they found was that xylitol blocked adhesion.
[03:12:32.224 --> 03:12:33.004]  Let me find the graph.
[03:12:33.084 --> 03:12:34.225]  Explain what that means, adhesion.
[03:12:34.565 --> 03:12:40.770]  So in order for a virus or a bacteria or any pathogen to make you sick, it has to attach.
[03:12:40.810 --> 03:12:42.531]  Like everybody talks about that spike protein.
[03:12:42.551 --> 03:12:43.672]  It's got to be able to get in the cell.
[03:12:43.692 --> 03:12:44.993]  It has to be able to attach to the cell.
[03:12:45.033 --> 03:12:46.194]  It has to be able to get into the cell.
[03:12:46.475 --> 03:12:49.797]  If you block that ability to adhere, then you're not going to get sick.
[03:12:49.817 --> 03:12:50.498]  So it's armor.
[03:12:50.798 --> 03:12:51.479]  Yeah, pretty much.
[03:12:52.159 --> 03:13:00.965]  Because the xylitol binds up on those receptor sites, blocks it, makes it so that the bacteria, the pathogen, the virus doesn't adhere to the tissue, your body... What is xylitol?
[03:13:00.985 --> 03:13:01.825]  Why does it work so good?
[03:13:01.845 --> 03:13:02.386]  It's a sugar.
[03:13:02.746 --> 03:13:03.887]  It's a natural sugar.
[03:13:04.247 --> 03:13:05.828]  We've been eating it for millennia.
[03:13:06.548 --> 03:13:14.273]  Um, you know, but what it does... So literally, placebo is sugar, but now we learned it really is good for this, and they're trying to block you from giving people sugar water.
[03:13:14.554 --> 03:13:14.774]  Correct.
[03:13:15.512 --> 03:13:15.993]  That is correct.
[03:13:16.213 --> 03:13:18.275]  But, I mean, the thing is, is you're snot.
[03:13:18.315 --> 03:13:22.440]  I mean, I don't want to get in and talk about snot, but your mucus, your snot, has all these mucins.
[03:13:22.500 --> 03:13:33.853]  It has all these sugars in it that help bind up on bacteria and all these other compounds that trap bacteria, that trap viruses, and if your mucus is dry and crusty, it's not going to trap it, it doesn't do it, it doesn't wash it away.
[03:13:34.614 --> 03:13:43.501]  Anyways, so this was a study done at the University of Tennessee where it showed that Xylitol and Iodocarragenin blocked the ability of the virus to adhere to the tissue.
[03:13:44.462 --> 03:13:55.791]  And these are some studies where if the FTC had actually listened and not blocked all this data, this is a study that was done in India using a nasal spray with Xylitol.
[03:13:56.611 --> 03:14:05.118]  And they showed a 64% above the saline placebo reduction in transmission of COVID in hospital workers treating COVID patients.
[03:14:05.138 --> 03:14:05.478]  Massive.
[03:14:05.819 --> 03:14:09.762]  Well, it's massive because you already know that the saline is effective.
[03:14:09.902 --> 03:14:13.545]  I just shared a whole bunch of the studies from that showing that saline is effective.
[03:14:14.517 --> 03:14:16.979]  The xylitol was 64% more effective.
[03:14:17.640 --> 03:14:20.782]  Here's a study that was done in Argentina, looking at iota carrageenan.
[03:14:21.042 --> 03:14:23.304]  They used it in India, they used it three times a day.
[03:14:24.125 --> 03:14:33.893]  In Australia, not Australia, Argentina, they used it four times a day, again in hospitals, with hospital workers, and what they found was it reduced by 79.8%.
[03:14:33.933 --> 03:14:35.514]  It reduced transmission of COVID by 80%.
[03:14:40.424 --> 03:14:40.644]  Okay.
[03:14:41.505 --> 03:14:51.352]  If the FTC had not been silencing, if they had not been editing and cutting all this out, there's countless people who would have known about these nasal sprays.
[03:14:51.412 --> 03:14:52.233]  Simple nasal hygiene.
[03:14:52.253 --> 03:14:53.534]  This undoubtedly killed a bunch of people.
[03:14:53.754 --> 03:14:54.214]  Absolutely.
[03:14:54.674 --> 03:14:59.218]  And the people in the FTC who are supposedly there to protect the consumer are responsible.
[03:14:59.918 --> 03:15:14.092]  By the way, I'm telling the crew, because we put this out later as an archive, put that clip right up front, because, and the same thing with ivermectin, the same thing with hydroxychloroquine, the same thing with budesonine steroid, and they just tried to block it and did block it and killed a bunch of people.
[03:15:14.492 --> 03:15:14.652]  Yeah.
[03:15:15.694 --> 03:15:18.097]  And this right here, I find really interesting.
[03:15:18.117 --> 03:15:19.819]  This is actually a paper that came out.
[03:15:20.099 --> 03:15:29.111]  It's a study that was done in Stanford, where they actually point out it was published in January 5 of 23, but it kind of just says what we've been saying for 25 years.
[03:15:30.461 --> 03:15:35.084]  That if you have something that blocks adhesion in the nose, it's going to reduce it.
[03:15:35.124 --> 03:15:40.307]  And these guys actually referred to it and said, hey, if you have something like that, it could be like a morning after nasal spray.
[03:15:40.667 --> 03:15:47.371]  You could use it as long, as far away as the next day after exposure, and it would still be effective.
[03:15:47.992 --> 03:15:49.113]  That's not me saying that.
[03:15:50.393 --> 03:15:51.594]  That's the doctors at Stanford.
[03:15:53.495 --> 03:15:55.136]  You don't just have to use it prophylactically?
[03:15:55.717 --> 03:15:56.077]  Yeah, you do.
[03:15:56.732 --> 03:15:58.513]  Do you use it once in the morning, once at night?
[03:15:58.853 --> 03:15:59.713]  Put it with your toothbrush.
[03:15:59.733 --> 03:16:02.854]  But I'm saying later, even if you get paranoid, hey, that person was sick, you can do it after.
[03:16:02.994 --> 03:16:03.274]  Oh yeah.
[03:16:03.954 --> 03:16:05.355]  That's what, that's what they're saying.
[03:16:05.395 --> 03:16:05.695]  Not me.
[03:16:05.835 --> 03:16:09.096]  I don't want to, I'm not... No, I know, but notice how they turn you into a criminal.
[03:16:09.116 --> 03:16:10.837]  We have hundreds of thousands dying from fentanyl.
[03:16:11.297 --> 03:16:14.718]  We have, they were refusing people care, sending them home, not giving them anything.
[03:16:15.698 --> 03:16:17.579]  And then ignoring all these doctors.
[03:16:18.139 --> 03:16:19.699]  So where are your cases now?
[03:16:19.719 --> 03:16:21.020]  Because I know they're coming after you.
[03:16:21.380 --> 03:16:22.580]  Well, they are coming after us.
[03:16:23.180 --> 03:16:25.981]  They were supposed to depose me next week, but they keep pushing it off.
[03:16:26.662 --> 03:16:28.202]  They're actually deposing my dad.
[03:16:28.642 --> 03:16:29.983]  They let us know like two weeks ago.
[03:16:30.003 --> 03:16:30.843]  Is that your dad over here?
[03:16:31.023 --> 03:16:31.243]  Yes.
[03:16:32.964 --> 03:16:34.164]  They let us know a couple of weeks ago.
[03:16:34.204 --> 03:16:35.124]  That looks old enough for your dad.
[03:16:35.144 --> 03:16:36.084]  He's got some good genes, huh?
[03:16:36.485 --> 03:16:37.025]  Well, I hope.
[03:16:37.765 --> 03:16:41.126]  But, you know, they let us know a couple of weeks ago.
[03:16:41.146 --> 03:16:42.507]  Can we get your dad in here next segment?
[03:16:42.747 --> 03:16:43.667]  Yeah, come in.
[03:16:44.249 --> 03:16:45.910]  All right, next segment, let's get a chair over here.
[03:16:45.930 --> 03:16:46.710]  What's your pop's name?
[03:16:47.411 --> 03:16:47.831]  Alonzo.
[03:16:48.311 --> 03:16:48.951]  Alonzo!
[03:16:49.372 --> 03:16:50.452]  Well, we're going to break, brother.
[03:16:50.612 --> 03:16:52.633]  We'll come back to you in a minute, okay?
[03:16:52.673 --> 03:16:53.194]  Yeah, right there.
[03:16:53.234 --> 03:16:53.474]  Wow.
[03:16:53.954 --> 03:16:55.075]  Well, thank you so much, Alonzo.
[03:16:55.495 --> 03:17:00.397]  Yeah, they let us know a couple of weeks ago that they wanted to pose my, what are you, 87?
[03:17:02.678 --> 03:17:05.940]  Almost 87-year-old dad to come in and be a witness against me.
[03:17:05.960 --> 03:17:07.041]  He looks like he could beat us up.
[03:17:07.061 --> 03:17:07.661]  What's he eating?
[03:17:10.103 --> 03:17:10.383]  I don't know.
[03:17:10.964 --> 03:17:11.744]  A lot of Xylitol.
[03:17:11.784 --> 03:17:13.205]  No, I'm kidding.
[03:17:13.525 --> 03:17:16.828]  So anyway, but that's some of the data that backs it up.
[03:17:17.508 --> 03:17:18.769]  You know, there's a couple of other ones.
[03:17:18.809 --> 03:17:29.457]  Some of the earlier studies that we did in early 2020, we actually did some studies, some viricidal studies, looking at what the nasal spray did to viruses.
[03:17:30.257 --> 03:17:37.462]  And what we found in, I mean, again, this is in early 2020, that the grapefruit seed extract that we've been using in our nasal spray for 23 years
[03:17:39.517 --> 03:17:41.698]  Stay right there.
[03:17:41.818 --> 03:17:44.378]  I want to talk about this.
[03:17:44.578 --> 03:17:45.799]  What you're saying is established.
[03:17:45.819 --> 03:17:46.639]  My audience knows.
[03:17:46.679 --> 03:17:47.699]  There's been all these studies.
[03:17:47.719 --> 03:17:49.639]  They've heard those doctors say it, who aren't even in the business of it.
[03:17:50.200 --> 03:17:55.961]  The issue here is they're coming after you, but it's got to scare them, the ivermectin rulings.
[03:17:55.981 --> 03:17:59.382]  Because, I mean, Xylitol is even more documented than ivermectin.
[03:17:59.622 --> 03:18:00.122]  We'll be right back.
[03:18:00.142 --> 03:18:00.502]  Stay with us.
[03:18:01.082 --> 03:18:05.805]  Everybody should go to Infowarsphone.com right now.
[03:18:06.006 --> 03:18:07.406]  Infowarsphone.com.
[03:18:07.687 --> 03:18:16.152]  They have all the solar panels, all the charging stations, all the best sat phones, all the best sat radios, all the best equipment at the best prices, and they support the broadcast.
[03:18:16.613 --> 03:18:18.374]  Infowarsphone.com.
[03:18:18.454 --> 03:18:21.216]  I think it's a default move to do this.
[03:18:21.716 --> 03:18:26.919]  It's an absolute essential, and it is so important to get ready, and I'm telling myself that.
[03:18:31.422 --> 03:18:31.722]  Right?
[03:18:32.062 --> 03:18:39.665]  And I know that even in the law enforcement part of it, that when people are, you know, run their phone, they can turn their phone off for 72 hours.
[03:18:39.725 --> 03:18:43.326]  Somebody in our group can ping that phone and track that phone for 72 hours.
[03:18:43.926 --> 03:18:45.067]  So you're not off the grid.
[03:18:46.087 --> 03:18:48.208]  So make sure you get your fair days leave.
[03:18:48.788 --> 03:18:50.209]  Have a sat phone as a backup.
[03:18:50.569 --> 03:18:55.070]  If you're concerned about secure messaging, the black phone will secure end to end encryption.
[03:18:55.770 --> 03:18:59.992]  Everybody should go to InfoWarsPhone.com right now.
[03:19:01.303 --> 03:19:05.368]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[03:19:05.408 --> 03:19:09.031]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[03:19:09.212 --> 03:19:11.314]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[03:19:11.594 --> 03:19:13.376]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[03:19:13.977 --> 03:19:16.500]  This is a different kind of war.
[03:19:17.325 --> 03:19:21.590]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[03:19:21.770 --> 03:19:24.973]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[03:19:25.174 --> 03:19:29.138]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[03:19:29.198 --> 03:19:31.560]  It was almost as if it were a plan in motion.
[03:19:37.088 --> 03:19:39.168]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[03:19:39.208 --> 03:19:40.789]  They are nothing but distractions.
[03:19:40.849 --> 03:19:43.249]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[03:19:43.629 --> 03:19:45.490]  You silenced those voices.
[03:19:45.530 --> 03:19:49.251]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[03:19:49.271 --> 03:19:55.733]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[03:20:02.230 --> 03:20:21.633]  Nathan Jones, the owner of a major, very successful over-the-counter medicine company, Clear.com, being sued and persecuted by the federal government for reporting what was on the CDC website that different nasal sprays kill the virus to a massive degree and mainly stop its replication and able to get into your cells.
[03:20:22.114 --> 03:20:28.835]  And his father that helped him start the company, who's a retired physician, Lon Jones, is here with us as well.
[03:20:28.955 --> 03:20:29.295]  Clear.com.
[03:20:30.555 --> 03:20:30.895]  All right.
[03:20:31.335 --> 03:20:32.296]  You got your dad here.
[03:20:32.316 --> 03:20:33.257]  You got a lot of points to make.
[03:20:33.577 --> 03:20:35.398]  Tell us about the ongoing battle.
[03:20:35.518 --> 03:20:36.438]  This affects everybody.
[03:20:36.838 --> 03:20:39.000]  But again, they just lost in court.
[03:20:40.240 --> 03:20:42.902]  They just had to admit that they were wrong to suppress ivermectin.
[03:20:42.922 --> 03:20:46.704]  They paid over $2 million to major pharmacies to block it.
[03:20:46.764 --> 03:20:53.027]  I mean, this is a organized syndicate monopoly of information and medical rights.
[03:20:53.127 --> 03:20:57.309]  And your dad's here, the founder of the company with you, and he's welcome to chime in.
[03:20:57.329 --> 03:20:58.250]  So just please continue.
[03:20:59.571 --> 03:21:04.854]  So, the government did sue us, and one of the things that I would really like to point out is that I live in Utah.
[03:21:05.355 --> 03:21:13.200]  The media in our home state, where the company is based, when the FTC sued us, we actually sent studies to the media in Utah.
[03:21:13.460 --> 03:21:19.084]  And I just want to call out the media in Utah that they did a great job of ignoring us, and ignoring all of the studies and all of the data.
[03:21:19.944 --> 03:21:35.049]  And the only, and even when we went to Washington D.C., the only congressional member that we could get to really talk with us was actually Congresswoman Mace, and she wrote a letter to Secretary Becerra asking why they weren't discussing nasal hygiene, why they weren't discussing nasal sprays.
[03:21:35.749 --> 03:21:45.912]  And as far as the media goes, the only media was actually, it was a podcast, and I kept getting these emails from a guy by the name of Chad Freeman in a podcast called Investigator, and he kept saying,
[03:21:46.852 --> 03:21:50.854]  The FTC banned it, or they're trying to shut you down, so it's gotta work.
[03:21:51.094 --> 03:21:52.915]  Will you come on our podcast and talk about it?
[03:21:53.895 --> 03:21:56.457]  So, I went on these podcasts a couple times and talked about it.
[03:21:57.017 --> 03:22:04.620]  But other than that, I mean, it's been hard to get the word out about nasal hygiene and washing out the nose and why it's important.
[03:22:05.101 --> 03:22:06.161]  Not just for COVID.
[03:22:06.661 --> 03:22:11.884]  I mean, most of the respiratory pathogens, or most of the pathogens that come into our body, come in through our nose.
[03:22:12.444 --> 03:22:26.047]  And nasal hygiene, just like oral hygiene, just like brushing your teeth in the morning, just like brushing your teeth at night, is something that you should do on a regular basis because it helps wash away bacteria and viruses and other pathogens before they get further into your body.
[03:22:27.968 --> 03:22:33.789]  Again, and they killed a lot of people blocking therapeutics, and this is one of the most central as a preventative.
[03:22:34.089 --> 03:22:35.490]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:22:35.570 --> 03:22:38.230]  And we have a doctor right here who invented it who can tell you about it.
[03:22:38.450 --> 03:22:39.110]  Lon Jones?
[03:22:40.231 --> 03:22:40.751]  You're on the spot.
[03:22:40.771 --> 03:22:40.951]  Yes, sir.
[03:22:42.205 --> 03:22:45.909]  My point comes from my studies before I went to medical school.
[03:22:46.870 --> 03:22:49.152]  And that was in the History of Science and Ideas.
[03:22:50.253 --> 03:22:54.597]  And I learned about an argument between Claude Bernard and Louis Pasteur.
[03:22:55.678 --> 03:23:02.304]  And Louis Pasteur said that our diseases come from microbes.
[03:23:03.485 --> 03:23:06.628]  Claude Bernard said they are equally caused by
[03:23:08.655 --> 03:23:10.876]  The soil where the microbe is planted.
[03:23:11.797 --> 03:23:14.719]  And that soil is us and our defenses.
[03:23:15.999 --> 03:23:22.343]  And we have ignored the defenses ever since that argument was won by by Louis Pasteur.
[03:23:22.924 --> 03:23:25.785]  He said bacteria caused the problem.
[03:23:26.566 --> 03:23:28.447]  We have a war with bacteria.
[03:23:28.847 --> 03:23:29.948]  We're trying to kill them.
[03:23:30.828 --> 03:23:34.571]  We know now that we have three trillion of them living in us.
[03:23:35.643 --> 03:23:39.844]  We shouldn't be trying to kill them, but that's what we do every time we take an antibiotic.
[03:23:39.864 --> 03:23:41.185]  Shouldn't we be trying to get the right ones?
[03:23:42.025 --> 03:23:42.325]  Yes.
[03:23:42.525 --> 03:23:46.606]  That's what Bill Gates is secretly invested in is actually good bacteria, but he won't give it to us.
[03:23:46.906 --> 03:23:48.367]  Yeah, we'd like to have the right ones.
[03:23:49.087 --> 03:23:52.488]  And what Xylitol does is focus on feeding the right ones.
[03:23:54.288 --> 03:23:59.970]  It builds a different biome in our GI tract and in our bodies that is healthy.
[03:24:00.863 --> 03:24:12.654]  I want to chime in there for a minute because, you know, the whole other product line that we have, which is Spry, the vast majority of the research that's been done with Xylitol is actually how it prevents tooth decay.
[03:24:13.375 --> 03:24:16.978]  Because whatever side of the fluoride argument you're on, which, you know,
[03:24:17.774 --> 03:24:22.377]  Whatever side you're on, fluoride does not treat tooth decay.
[03:24:22.917 --> 03:24:25.018]  All it does is help remineralize your enamel.
[03:24:25.099 --> 03:24:32.923]  If you want to treat the bacterial infection that is tooth decay, you have to have something that's going to get rid of the mutants bacteria that live in your mouth.
[03:24:34.724 --> 03:24:40.368]  Well, my issue is, wouldn't it be a little bit of calcium fluoride you'd want?
[03:24:40.408 --> 03:24:43.890]  You wouldn't want sodium fluoride or hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:24:44.946 --> 03:24:46.487]  Well, I think there's better things out there.
[03:24:46.507 --> 03:24:48.848]  Hydroxyapatite, trimetaphosphate.
[03:24:49.028 --> 03:24:55.811]  There's other things out there that remineralize your enamel much better, and much more effectively, and much safer than fluoride in any form.
[03:24:57.132 --> 03:24:57.392]  Dot?
[03:24:57.892 --> 03:25:04.256]  And the nice thing about that avenue is that it bypasses the Food and Drug Administration.
[03:25:05.716 --> 03:25:12.740]  Because you're talking about the environment in your mouth, and I'm talking about the environment in your nose.
[03:25:14.031 --> 03:25:21.117]  And if both of them can be made healthier, both of them can be optimized, the defenses can be optimized.
[03:25:21.557 --> 03:25:29.304]  We have airway defenses that are made up of our cilia that sweep out all the mucus and the mucus that hangs onto all the garbage.
[03:25:29.904 --> 03:25:37.450]  If we optimize that process, we don't have allergies, asthma, sinus infections, ear infections, bronchitis.
[03:25:38.131 --> 03:25:40.293]  Because the nose and mouth is really the gateway, isn't it?
[03:25:40.553 --> 03:25:40.873]  Yes.
[03:25:42.275 --> 03:25:42.675]  Exactly.
[03:25:43.348 --> 03:25:53.850]  And if you manage your gateway microbiomes, your nasal microbiome, yes there is a nasal microbiome, yes there is an oral microbiome, the rest of your gut microbiome is really going to fall into place and be healthy.
[03:25:56.171 --> 03:26:00.771]  So what's it been like being targeted by the feds for doing something that's on their website with studies?
[03:26:03.032 --> 03:26:03.552]  Expensive.
[03:26:03.832 --> 03:26:05.632]  Use xylitol as soap for your nose.
[03:26:06.533 --> 03:26:07.793]  It builds a better biome.
[03:26:08.743 --> 03:26:09.844]  It builds a better body.
[03:26:10.704 --> 03:26:13.146]  Well, what about just the neti pot with the salt in it?
[03:26:13.186 --> 03:26:14.146]  That's pretty good too, right?
[03:26:15.887 --> 03:26:18.288]  That's good every now and then.
[03:26:18.349 --> 03:26:21.510]  I don't do it a lot, but if I'm having an allergy attack, I just do the neti pot.
[03:26:21.550 --> 03:26:22.071]  It really helps.
[03:26:22.251 --> 03:26:23.391]  I do nasal spray too.
[03:26:23.571 --> 03:26:25.853]  But if you use a nasal spray, it's more effective.
[03:26:25.873 --> 03:26:30.095]  And the reason why is if you think of what your nose is, it's covered in snot.
[03:26:30.375 --> 03:26:31.256]  It's covered in mucus.
[03:26:31.836 --> 03:26:33.798]  And that mucus is there to trap bacteria.
[03:26:33.818 --> 03:26:34.839]  It's there to trap pollen.
[03:26:34.879 --> 03:26:37.001]  It's there to trap bacteria and all this other stuff.
[03:26:37.061 --> 03:26:38.001]  And salt knocks it out.
[03:26:38.282 --> 03:26:38.822]  And salt does.
[03:26:39.162 --> 03:26:44.407]  But flushing it with all that water, you're actually cleaning away that entire protective layer of mucus.
[03:26:45.097 --> 03:26:48.261]  And if you do that, you're leaving all the underlying tissue exposed.
[03:26:49.041 --> 03:27:03.818]  And if you go read some of the articles and the videos that are out there by Dr. Talal Nasuli, he actually talks about that, how he had people who were using the neti pot and the irrigation bottles chronically, and if they stopped using it, most of their symptoms went away.
[03:27:04.784 --> 03:27:10.166]  Well, I don't use it a lot, maybe once a month, but I guess a little bit of use might be good if you have something to get it out, but I get what you're saying.
[03:27:10.486 --> 03:27:12.486]  Xylitol instead coats and leaves your mucus, you're saying.
[03:27:12.727 --> 03:27:12.987]  Correct.
[03:27:13.387 --> 03:27:18.408]  And my dad, being a physician, I don't know if they allow it to be said on the air, but he'll give an analogy.
[03:27:18.448 --> 03:27:20.369]  Well, say it anyway, you're not really on the air.
[03:27:21.529 --> 03:27:23.130]  We don't tell women to douche anymore.
[03:27:24.050 --> 03:27:24.270]  Why?
[03:27:24.290 --> 03:27:28.091]  Because now it's medically known that it removes the mucus membrane.
[03:27:28.271 --> 03:27:32.533]  Because it washes away the protective bacteria in your vagina.
[03:27:34.369 --> 03:27:36.871]  And so douching is the wrong thing.
[03:27:37.492 --> 03:27:38.753]  Same thing with the neti pot.
[03:27:40.414 --> 03:27:42.076]  Well, I brought up neti pot and you learn something every day.
[03:27:43.137 --> 03:27:48.681]  You're washing away the normal bacteria that are helping you, that are part of your defense.
[03:27:48.781 --> 03:27:49.002]  Yeah.
[03:27:49.682 --> 03:27:50.663]  Interesting.
[03:27:50.763 --> 03:27:52.184]  And the protective mucosal layer.
[03:27:52.705 --> 03:27:52.905]  Yeah.
[03:27:53.526 --> 03:27:56.128]  Well, I don't use it a lot, but sometimes I have a really bad sinus headache.
[03:27:57.062 --> 03:28:00.163]  Maybe because I've got so much pollen in there already, it flushes it out, and it does help me.
[03:28:00.183 --> 03:28:02.464]  But I would imagine people would do it all the time.
[03:28:02.484 --> 03:28:03.164]  That could be a problem.
[03:28:03.584 --> 03:28:05.444]  You're better if you tweak that environment.
[03:28:06.245 --> 03:28:06.765]  No, I'm listening.
[03:28:06.825 --> 03:28:07.545]  I'm learning stuff every day.
[03:28:08.305 --> 03:28:09.265]  I know that I know nothing.
[03:28:11.066 --> 03:28:11.306]  Good.
[03:28:11.526 --> 03:28:12.666]  That's a good place to start.
[03:28:12.686 --> 03:28:12.967]  Socrates.
[03:28:13.607 --> 03:28:14.407]  Socrates, yep.
[03:28:15.067 --> 03:28:15.727]  Or my variant.
[03:28:15.767 --> 03:28:16.407]  I'm kind of retarded.
[03:28:19.025 --> 03:28:20.887]  Anyways, so do you have any questions?
[03:28:20.947 --> 03:28:23.930]  Anybody have any questions about what's going on with the fight right now?
[03:28:23.970 --> 03:28:24.391]  Where is it?
[03:28:24.411 --> 03:28:25.252]  What are they trying to do to you?
[03:28:25.572 --> 03:28:28.515]  So I am getting deposed in two weeks.
[03:28:28.755 --> 03:28:30.958]  It was supposed to be next week, but they pushed it off.
[03:28:32.219 --> 03:28:34.181]  I don't know why they keep pushing it off and keep pushing it.
[03:28:34.221 --> 03:28:34.942]  And what is their goal?
[03:28:34.982 --> 03:28:35.863]  Penalize you for
[03:28:36.483 --> 03:28:38.105]  Quoting public studies doing their own.
[03:28:38.445 --> 03:28:40.888]  They really haven't come out with that.
[03:28:40.968 --> 03:28:46.553]  I mean as soon as, it's interesting because I do believe that they know they're going to lose the lawsuit.
[03:28:46.893 --> 03:28:50.677]  And I would imagine the people suing you now, they probably figured this out so they've got nasal spray.
[03:28:51.117 --> 03:28:54.421]  Yeah, but I think that they understand they're going to lose.
[03:28:54.761 --> 03:29:00.406]  And the FTC and other government agencies, they have a saying there that, you know, the process is the punishment.
[03:29:01.047 --> 03:29:06.448]  Which means we don't care whether we win or lose, we're just going to make you hurt next time you're going to do what we say without questioning.
[03:29:06.468 --> 03:29:08.268]  You can beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.
[03:29:08.649 --> 03:29:08.949]  Correct.
[03:29:09.509 --> 03:29:23.872]  And, you know, if I cared more about, uh, you know, if I didn't care more about the people of America and us being able to have free speech and share published data and make sense, then I probably would have just said, well, okay, we'll just walk away and let people die.
[03:29:24.032 --> 03:29:25.232]  But I didn't.
[03:29:28.410 --> 03:29:29.411]  Give us more knowledge, Doc.
[03:29:29.451 --> 03:29:32.053]  You were laying some stuff on us about Louis Pasteur and all that.
[03:29:33.674 --> 03:29:36.075]  Well, that's what you learn when you learn the history of medicine.
[03:29:36.836 --> 03:29:38.737]  And it goes all the way back to Hippocrates.
[03:29:38.757 --> 03:29:43.421]  Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine, said a very wise thing.
[03:29:43.461 --> 03:29:45.542]  He said, your food should be your drugs.
[03:29:46.863 --> 03:29:48.224]  I would like to get back to that.
[03:29:50.065 --> 03:29:53.027]  In the old days, doctors said, get some good healthy food and sunshine.
[03:29:53.688 --> 03:29:53.908]  Yep.
[03:29:53.928 --> 03:29:56.350]  But sunshine will kill you today.
[03:29:57.270 --> 03:29:58.011]  Just ask the government.
[03:29:59.013 --> 03:30:05.016]  Yeah, you know, uh, the head propagandist for Obama said he would like to make it illegal to say the sun's good for you.
[03:30:05.977 --> 03:30:09.559]  That was like one of the benchmarks, uh, Lewis, uh, uh, casting.
[03:30:10.079 --> 03:30:11.580]  That was one of the benchmarks he wanted to be able to do.
[03:30:11.600 --> 03:30:14.282]  Like, two men can have a baby, and sunshine's bad.
[03:30:15.842 --> 03:30:16.603]  I'd be dead by now.
[03:30:18.410 --> 03:30:20.351]  Man, I could be exhausted, a little depressed, whatever.
[03:30:20.371 --> 03:30:21.832]  Go out and lay in the sun for an hour.
[03:30:22.032 --> 03:30:22.433]  Feel great.
[03:30:22.613 --> 03:30:23.993]  I go out in the sun all the time.
[03:30:24.394 --> 03:30:26.795]  I enjoy going out in the sun.
[03:30:27.055 --> 03:30:28.176]  But it's bad for the plants, though.
[03:30:28.536 --> 03:30:29.797]  Yes, it's bad for the planet.
[03:30:29.817 --> 03:30:33.139]  We've got to put some stuff up there in the atmosphere to block the sun's rays.
[03:30:33.239 --> 03:30:34.240]  Bill Gates is working on that.
[03:30:35.960 --> 03:30:55.867]  I think if, you know, and one of the things that I probably should discuss is, you know, they're really public health and their abject failure for them to discuss hygiene in any form during the last five years just shows that they have been completely bought by the pharmaceutical industry.
[03:30:56.507 --> 03:31:02.229]  If you go back, let's say, to the 1880s to the 1980s, which I consider to be the golden age of public health,
[03:31:03.206 --> 03:31:06.307]  The public health was out there and they were talking to people about nutrition.
[03:31:06.327 --> 03:31:08.928]  They were talking to people about diet, exercise.
[03:31:08.968 --> 03:31:16.010]  I mean, when I went to school they had, you know, you had to go out and run around in circles in the gym and exercise and they taught you about nutrition in school.
[03:31:16.350 --> 03:31:23.132]  They even had hygienists that came around with those little pink pills and you'd shoot them up and you'd see whether you were brushing or not and they would teach you how to brush your teeth better.
[03:31:23.493 --> 03:31:24.593]  They don't do this anymore.
[03:31:25.193 --> 03:31:30.615]  And public health, if they really stuck to their guns, they would be talking about nutrition,
[03:31:31.597 --> 03:31:32.179]  Exercise?
[03:31:32.481 --> 03:31:34.771]  They would be talking about public sanitation.
[03:31:35.859 --> 03:31:38.241]  And also about hygiene, personal hygiene.
[03:31:38.261 --> 03:31:40.122]  And hygiene and sanitation are kind of the same thing.
[03:31:40.522 --> 03:31:41.783]  One's personal, one's communal.
[03:31:42.264 --> 03:31:50.369]  But, and doctors get all mad at me when I say this, but your average plumber has probably saved more lives than your average doctor.
[03:31:50.409 --> 03:31:51.390]  Let me expand on that.
[03:31:51.931 --> 03:31:57.194]  I had a scientist on, it's Australia, Europe, the US, Canada, they have graphs going back over 120 years.
[03:31:58.315 --> 03:31:59.796]  Sanitation comes in in the 1880s, 1890s.
[03:32:03.012 --> 03:32:03.132]  Yeah, 100%.
[03:32:24.233 --> 03:32:30.939]  And public health, they should be talking about hygiene, sanitation, exercise, and nutrition.
[03:32:31.079 --> 03:32:34.301]  And all they talk about is vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine.
[03:32:34.842 --> 03:32:38.084]  And that's why we have an increase in all of these illnesses.
[03:32:38.384 --> 03:32:42.648]  That's why tooth decay, after about 80-85, started going up again.
[03:32:42.708 --> 03:32:43.428]  And it went up enough.
[03:32:44.409 --> 03:32:50.413]  That I'm almost positive, I'm trying to make sure when it happened, but now they don't even report it.
[03:32:50.773 --> 03:32:54.336]  They report untreated cavities, not cavities.
[03:32:54.776 --> 03:33:05.023]  Well let's take the studies we had a couple doctors on, like Dr. Peter McCullough just last week.
[03:33:05.904 --> 03:33:10.367]  99% of the monkeypox cases are homosexual men who are
[03:33:11.047 --> 03:33:15.051]  Doing horrible things and doing very dirty bad things, basically eating out of the toilet.
[03:33:16.032 --> 03:33:18.855]  And, well, the equivalent of that, or what puts things in the toilet.
[03:33:19.536 --> 03:33:24.741]  And then they have a guy that's into that as the head of their monkey pox thing, and the answer is, don't eat poop.
[03:33:26.082 --> 03:33:28.404]  The answer is, take this new experimental shot.
[03:33:29.145 --> 03:33:31.007]  So there's a perfect example of sanitation.
[03:33:31.387 --> 03:33:31.588]  Yeah.
[03:33:32.909 --> 03:33:34.791]  I mean, you know, you could have...
[03:33:35.922 --> 03:33:49.747]  All of the work that the great and glorious Anthony Fauci did with AIDS, AIDS was really mitigated not by anything else other than using a condom, and later on by some of the drugs that were developed.
[03:33:50.348 --> 03:33:53.849]  But if they'd started talking about condoms early on, it would have ended a lot sooner.
[03:33:55.110 --> 03:33:58.371]  And a lot of the studies, that population was also on a lot of methamphetamine and other drugs.
[03:33:59.735 --> 03:34:00.796]  Their immune systems are run down.
[03:34:01.056 --> 03:34:02.117]  I was a kid, so I don't know.
[03:34:02.197 --> 03:34:06.560]  I have a very smart daughter who has a very good lecture on condom sense.
[03:34:08.961 --> 03:34:10.522]  And so many people forget it.
[03:34:12.104 --> 03:34:14.265]  Because a condom is a good way.
[03:34:14.305 --> 03:34:15.126]  It's like a mask.
[03:34:15.246 --> 03:34:16.987]  It prevents contagion.
[03:34:18.528 --> 03:34:19.909]  And it would stop monkeypox.
[03:34:19.989 --> 03:34:20.989]  And it would stop AIDS.
[03:34:22.531 --> 03:34:25.933]  But there's no money in condoms.
[03:34:27.134 --> 03:34:27.714]  Follow the money.
[03:34:28.274 --> 03:34:28.915]  Follow the money.
[03:34:31.545 --> 03:34:46.281]  One of the other avenues that you're talking about, what happened during the 19th and early 20th century, if you look at longevity, and longevity is one of the best measures of a healthcare system.
[03:34:47.651 --> 03:34:54.814]  And longevity during the period from 1850 to 1950 in the United States increased by an average of three years per decade.
[03:34:54.954 --> 03:34:55.294]  Huge.
[03:34:55.854 --> 03:34:56.094]  Yeah.
[03:34:56.554 --> 03:34:57.475]  Very, very good.
[03:34:58.495 --> 03:35:00.556]  1950, it changed to two years per decade.
[03:35:01.396 --> 03:35:01.576]  Till 2010.
[03:35:01.756 --> 03:35:05.078]  2010, it shifted to one.
[03:35:05.938 --> 03:35:07.919]  And since COVID, it's been trending negative.
[03:35:08.885 --> 03:35:12.307]  That's not a very good reflection on our healthcare system.
[03:35:13.087 --> 03:35:14.788]  And population for the first time peaked.
[03:35:15.048 --> 03:35:15.969]  It's now dropping worldwide.
[03:35:16.709 --> 03:35:17.709]  First time since the Black Plague.
[03:35:18.830 --> 03:35:19.230]  First time?
[03:35:19.570 --> 03:35:24.133]  Since the Black Plague that world population is now going down.
[03:35:26.815 --> 03:35:29.197]  Not a good reflection on healthcare.
[03:35:29.597 --> 03:35:30.938]  Elon Musk talks a lot about that.
[03:35:31.018 --> 03:35:33.079]  I mean, isn't healthcare more and more just a big cartel?
[03:35:33.819 --> 03:35:40.504]  And they're trying to computerize it all so that the doctors have to just be basically delivery boys and women that just follow orders?
[03:35:41.605 --> 03:35:43.666]  I think Woody Harrelson did a skit on that, didn't he?
[03:35:44.026 --> 03:35:44.686]  It was excellent.
[03:35:45.006 --> 03:35:52.168]  Guys, put up, not the whole thing, but go to X. Woody Harrelson, Saturday Night Live, COVID.
[03:35:52.888 --> 03:35:54.609]  Woody Harrelson, Saturday Night Live, COVID.
[03:35:55.389 --> 03:35:57.429]  And it was a perfect analogy.
[03:35:58.910 --> 03:36:08.112]  But that was actually a great analogy of it because he called it out, he said it like it was, and, you know, the pharmaceutical companies are out there, they're paying off the people at the FDA.
[03:36:08.132 --> 03:36:10.093]  I mean, you want to talk about paying people off?
[03:36:11.261 --> 03:36:19.563]  Even the opioid epidemic, we were talking about this on the ride over here, even the opioid epidemic was caused by the FDA.
[03:36:21.104 --> 03:36:29.666]  If the FDA, they had a guy in there, Curtis Wright, who the Purdue Pharma went to him and said, hey, we want to get this drug approved.
[03:36:29.686 --> 03:36:31.287]  He said, no, we want this drug approved.
[03:36:31.347 --> 03:36:32.727]  No, you don't have the data.
[03:36:32.787 --> 03:36:32.967]  No.
[03:36:33.627 --> 03:36:35.628]  They went to a hotel in Pennsylvania.
[03:36:36.667 --> 03:36:37.648]  Next day, he got approved.
[03:36:37.688 --> 03:36:38.669]  No black box warning.
[03:36:39.209 --> 03:36:39.990]  Everything good to go.
[03:36:40.130 --> 03:36:42.451]  And he had a job working for Purdue a couple months later.
[03:36:43.953 --> 03:36:51.678]  Well, look at how most all the FDA board formally worked for Pfizer, Moderna, or AstraZeneca, or Merck.
[03:36:53.320 --> 03:36:53.480]  Yep.
[03:36:53.940 --> 03:36:56.582]  And most of the boards of those companies used to work for the FDA.
[03:36:58.283 --> 03:37:00.145]  Let me know when you find that Woody Harrelson clip, guys.
[03:37:00.165 --> 03:37:02.426]  Just Woody Harrelson, Saturday Night Live, COVID.
[03:37:03.147 --> 03:37:05.429]  The whole skit's like three minutes long, but it's the part where he says,
[03:37:06.758 --> 03:37:09.939]  Well, I forget what he said, but he's like, you know, imagine a government that makes you take it.
[03:37:10.179 --> 03:37:10.659]  It was something.
[03:37:10.679 --> 03:37:25.525]  What he said is, imagine a movie script where the cartels, the drug cartels, all come together and they force you to stay inside your house to where you can't go out or socialize or hang out with your friends until you take their drugs.
[03:37:26.445 --> 03:37:29.886]  Then after that, then you can come out, but no one would believe it.
[03:37:29.906 --> 03:37:31.987]  But that's where we're at.
[03:37:32.938 --> 03:37:33.398]  In real life.
[03:37:33.559 --> 03:37:40.725]  And I talked to folks, I know Woody, I've been in a movie with him, we've been friends, I've talked to him in years, but I talked to folks, they said that was off script, he just did that on his own.
[03:37:41.046 --> 03:37:41.566]  Oh, I love it.
[03:37:41.966 --> 03:37:42.887]  I thought it was hilarious.
[03:37:43.208 --> 03:37:52.316]  Well, we need to, and even if they don't find that while we're live, there's a few minutes left, we'll put that in post once we archive this up to Bandop Video and real Alex Jones.
[03:37:52.476 --> 03:37:52.976]  Oh, we have it!
[03:37:53.937 --> 03:37:55.579]  Alright, so we'll go ahead and roll that now.
[03:37:55.999 --> 03:37:56.480]  Here it is.
[03:37:57.244 --> 03:37:59.325]  Okay, so the movie goes like this.
[03:38:00.145 --> 03:38:17.792]  The biggest drug cartels in the world get together and buy up all the media and all the politicians and force all the people in the world to stay locked in their homes and people can only come out if they take the cartels' drugs and keep taking them over and over.
[03:38:18.693 --> 03:38:20.133]  I threw the script away.
[03:38:20.834 --> 03:38:23.635]  I mean, who was gonna believe that crazy idea?
[03:38:25.643 --> 03:38:25.923]  Wow.
[03:38:27.004 --> 03:38:28.546]  So there you go.
[03:38:28.566 --> 03:38:32.129]  In the closing time, we have Doc Closing Comments, your son.
[03:38:32.229 --> 03:38:33.771]  You guys found the company, owner of the company.
[03:38:34.411 --> 03:38:37.034]  Again, I like how you brought your competitors here.
[03:38:37.054 --> 03:38:40.917]  I mean, all these are great products, but I mean, what do they allow you to say it's for?
[03:38:41.958 --> 03:38:42.239]  Nothing.
[03:38:43.605 --> 03:38:53.771]  That's the whole, I mean the whole thing is we, and it goes back because soap, we all know that soap is one of the best ways, washing your hands, to stop the spread of communicable diseases.
[03:38:53.791 --> 03:38:56.513]  Yeah, why can Lysol say it kills 99% of viruses?
[03:38:56.533 --> 03:38:57.814]  They didn't even get to study it, it's just known.
[03:38:58.732 --> 03:39:00.472]  Well, they did do a study.
[03:39:00.612 --> 03:39:01.393]  Yes, exactly.
[03:39:01.773 --> 03:39:10.075]  But the soap companies can't say it prevents any illness because the CDC is supposed to be out there teaching people about hygiene and sanitation.
[03:39:10.375 --> 03:39:10.775]  They're not.
[03:39:11.295 --> 03:39:12.595]  Nasal hygiene is the same way.
[03:39:13.556 --> 03:39:17.977]  Why can't private groups with published studies and facts be able to be educational?
[03:39:18.857 --> 03:39:19.237]  I don't know.
[03:39:19.257 --> 03:39:20.717]  That's FDA, that's our government.
[03:39:20.737 --> 03:39:23.218]  Well, it's only Bill Gates because he spends billions buying them all off.
[03:39:23.478 --> 03:39:24.318]  Actually, that's probably true.
[03:39:24.818 --> 03:39:27.459]  But the regulations are that we can't, other people can.
[03:39:28.812 --> 03:39:30.153]  But no one else wants to talk about it.
[03:39:30.293 --> 03:39:37.539]  You would have thought that during COVID, you had the greatest opportunity for public health to actually come out and change the course of health in the United States.
[03:39:37.819 --> 03:39:42.843]  And they completely bulleted, they completely dropped the ball, because they could have talked about brushing your teeth.
[03:39:42.883 --> 03:39:48.908]  I mean, when the studies came out of Israel and Canada, where they showed that people who had periodontal disease, you know, they just need to brush your teeth a little bit more.
[03:39:49.349 --> 03:39:53.272]  Those people were nine times more likely to be hospitalized and die if they got COVID.
[03:39:53.792 --> 03:39:57.340]  And you never heard the CDC or the Surgeon General come out and say, hey people, brush your teeth.
[03:39:57.741 --> 03:40:00.067]  You never heard the CDC come out and say, hey, go for a walk.
[03:40:00.407 --> 03:40:01.831]  Stay away from people, but go for a walk.
[03:40:02.651 --> 03:40:05.091]  It was sit at home, eat pizza, get fat, get sick.
[03:40:05.532 --> 03:40:20.194]  Don't come to the hospital until you're totally almost dead, which, you could draw a graph, and where people, from where you're perfectly healthy to where you're perfectly sick, or perfectly dead, if you draw this graph, right here's where it's the most expensive to treat them, right here's where it's the cheapest.
[03:40:20.814 --> 03:40:24.635]  And it's much easier to treat people when they're healthy than it is when they get sick.
[03:40:25.155 --> 03:40:27.095]  We're gonna put that up for the interview, that was powerful.
[03:40:27.615 --> 03:40:28.935]  Right there, Doc, closing comments.
[03:40:32.873 --> 03:40:37.719]  Long time ago, when we developed as human beings, we were in the forests.
[03:40:38.640 --> 03:40:43.266]  And the humidity in most forests ranges in the 40 to 60 percent range.
[03:40:44.668 --> 03:40:46.790]  In 1986, a guy named A.V.
[03:40:46.950 --> 03:40:52.314]  Arendelle did a study looking at the effect of humidity on upper respiratory problems.
[03:40:53.115 --> 03:41:02.942]  He found, guess what, the optimal zone for your nasal defenses to work appropriately and optimally was between 40 and 60 percent.
[03:41:05.526 --> 03:41:07.887]  Now, we didn't stay in those forests of Africa.
[03:41:08.247 --> 03:41:09.487]  We moved northward.
[03:41:09.627 --> 03:41:11.407]  We developed, we built houses.
[03:41:12.127 --> 03:41:13.608]  In our day, we built houses.
[03:41:13.868 --> 03:41:19.749]  In 1965, half of new houses also had air conditioning and heating.
[03:41:19.949 --> 03:41:20.329]  Central.
[03:41:21.470 --> 03:41:26.631]  And what those technologies do to the air and to the water in the air is dry it.
[03:41:28.550 --> 03:41:32.111]  So pay attention to your humidity in the air that you breathe.
[03:41:32.812 --> 03:41:49.339]  And if it's not in that healthy range of 40 to 60 percent, and optimally, really, it's 50 percent, because if it's 50 percent, what Arendelle found in his article in 1986 was that respiratory infections are not enough to count.
[03:41:50.319 --> 03:41:52.620]  So if you want to... And actually, even mama and grandma knew that.
[03:41:52.660 --> 03:41:54.401]  When the kids get sick, get a humidifier in there.
[03:41:54.941 --> 03:41:55.121]  Yeah.
[03:41:57.443 --> 03:42:00.205]  It's just more water, and then even better, xylitol in water.
[03:42:00.865 --> 03:42:01.105]  Yes.
[03:42:01.245 --> 03:42:02.225]  But we're not supposed to say that.
[03:42:02.506 --> 03:42:04.967]  Because xylitol pulls water into your nose.
[03:42:05.647 --> 03:42:13.291]  Two sprays a day will get you to the 40% range if it's cold season, and your humidity is 20% in your house that you're breathing.
[03:42:14.451 --> 03:42:15.812]  Two or three a day will get you to 40%.
[03:42:15.852 --> 03:42:18.973]  So the answer is, do it in the morning, do it at noon, and do it before you go to bed.
[03:42:19.013 --> 03:42:19.153]  Yeah.
[03:42:19.354 --> 03:42:26.397]  I just want to point out that the FTC, with their new guidance, you're going to have to have two RCT studies to back that up.
[03:42:27.458 --> 03:42:29.059]  Because what you just said is a health claim.
[03:42:29.640 --> 03:42:33.582]  So you can't talk about humidifiers until you have two RCT studies showing it.
[03:42:33.622 --> 03:42:35.303]  It's another attack on free speech.
[03:42:35.343 --> 03:42:36.804]  These tyrants are out of control.
[03:42:37.125 --> 03:42:38.446]  I didn't say anything about health.
[03:42:39.306 --> 03:42:39.887]  It's implied.
[03:42:39.907 --> 03:42:43.469]  We're all committing thought crimes in the big free America.
[03:42:43.529 --> 03:42:45.731]  Oh my god, humidifiers are bad that grandma put in.
[03:42:46.736 --> 03:42:53.260]  Oh my god, I remember my mother had one of those, it was like a big coffee pop, it was clear, and anytime I didn't feel good, she'd put it by the bed, and then I'd feel good in the morning.
[03:42:53.781 --> 03:42:59.704]  Incredible, Nathan Jones, Lon Jones, clear.com with an X, X-L-E-A-R, great products, amazing.
[03:43:00.405 --> 03:43:03.587]  I'm going to talk to you about being a sponsor, you're going to get in with the bad guys over here.
[03:43:04.027 --> 03:43:05.948]  I've been in with the bad guys for a long time.
[03:43:05.968 --> 03:43:07.990]  The bad guys are really the good guys, like the Dukes of Hazzard.
[03:43:08.570 --> 03:43:09.351]  All right, gentlemen.
[03:43:09.391 --> 03:43:10.092]  Thank you so much.
[03:43:10.152 --> 03:43:11.473]  I'm going to end the transmission now.
[03:43:11.813 --> 03:43:12.634]  Incredible job, the crew.
[03:43:12.654 --> 03:43:14.176]  We're going to be following with Owen Schroer coming up.
[03:43:14.496 --> 03:43:17.079]  The shooting in Georgia, which they're obviously going to seize on right before the debate.
[03:43:17.119 --> 03:43:17.719]  Magic timing.
[03:43:17.960 --> 03:43:21.223]  We're sad for those that got shot and hope more live and get better.
[03:43:21.523 --> 03:43:22.064]  Pray for them.
[03:43:22.404 --> 03:43:28.990]  Owen Schroer takes over now at InfoWars.com forward slash show and Real Alex Jones on X with the Mighty War Room.
[03:43:29.711 --> 03:43:30.892]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:43:30.912 --> 03:43:32.813]  More Infowars transmissions the enemy hates.
[03:43:33.193 --> 03:43:33.954]  Straight ahead.
[03:43:34.394 --> 03:43:39.377]  COVID vaccine causes more heart damage than COVID virus and brain, blood, immune cancer.
[03:43:39.457 --> 03:43:40.158]  Reproductive study.
[03:43:40.498 --> 03:43:41.418]  I mean, there's so many studies.
[03:43:41.438 --> 03:43:41.959]  What do you make of that?
[03:43:42.039 --> 03:43:44.120]  This finally settled the question, Alex.
[03:43:44.420 --> 03:43:50.164]  The COVID vaccine causes myocarditis in young people, not the infection.
[03:43:50.584 --> 03:43:52.066]  It's a government false narrative.
[03:43:52.126 --> 03:43:57.993]  It's been propagated through the American College of Cardiology and other agencies that the infection causes myocarditis.
[03:43:58.193 --> 03:43:58.874]  It doesn't.
[03:43:59.094 --> 03:44:01.096]  Looking at this, then, we see these headlines constantly.
[03:44:01.116 --> 03:44:03.018]  When you follow the article, there's no link, there's no proof.
[03:44:03.058 --> 03:44:07.463]  It just says, COVID'S A GREATER RISK OF HEART PROBLEMS THAN THE SHOT, and they just lie.
[03:44:09.065 --> 03:44:16.870]  It's a, essentially, it's a giant medical lie perpetrated by the American College of Cardiology, the CDC, the NIH.
[03:44:17.731 --> 03:44:19.492]  This is a false narrative.
[03:44:19.872 --> 03:44:23.335]  No confirmed cases by adjudication or autopsy.
[03:44:23.395 --> 03:44:24.515]  No hospitalizations and deaths.
[03:44:24.776 --> 03:44:27.517]  But the vaccine, we are, I'm a cardiologist, Alex.
[03:44:27.638 --> 03:44:31.760]  I am knee-deep in people with vaccine myocarditis causing heart failure.
[03:44:32.000 --> 03:44:35.363]  The vaccines do cause heart arrhythmias and insomnias.
[03:44:35.463 --> 03:44:38.865]  Inflammation in the heart, atrial fibrillation, sometimes ventricular arrhythmia.
[03:44:39.585 --> 03:44:41.466]  COVID shots can enlarge and weaken the heart.
[03:44:41.526 --> 03:44:42.087]  Another study.
[03:44:42.467 --> 03:44:48.029]  Heart failure can be an outcome of subclinical myocarditis.
[03:44:48.109 --> 03:44:49.530]  It's very important for people to realize.
[03:44:49.550 --> 03:44:58.594]  They may not feel chest pain initially, but then they have the onset of effort intolerance, pulmonary edema, congestion, and leg swelling.
[03:44:58.634 --> 03:45:01.576]  I have cases from Austin, Alex, referred up to my office.
[03:45:01.896 --> 03:45:04.137]  It's vaccine, myocarditis, and heart failure.
[03:45:04.537 --> 03:45:05.757]  They need treatment for this.
[03:45:06.097 --> 03:45:13.959]  The go-to is McCullough Protocol Base Spike Protein Detoxification with supplements available through OnlineHealthNow.com.
[03:45:14.179 --> 03:45:15.319]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[03:45:15.379 --> 03:45:24.541]  We have ample data now suggesting every cancer is increasing worldwide in virtually every organ system, and it's related to COVID-19 vaccines.
[03:45:24.701 --> 03:45:33.743]  Now, I'm glad, Dr. McCullough, that you brought up how to detox, either whether you got COVID in the wild, which you know is a lot less from the studies, as bad as taking the shots,
[03:45:34.721 --> 03:45:43.244]  But if you want to detox from it, you're one of the top research doctors out there, one of the, if not the most published.
[03:45:43.804 --> 03:45:51.427]  You have actually developed something, come up with something available at onlinehealthnow.com that you're saying is the go-to here.
[03:45:51.827 --> 03:45:54.948]  Spend a few minutes telling us about that anti-spike protein protocol.
[03:45:55.248 --> 03:45:59.513]  It's the base of what we do now in long COVID and vaccine injury syndromes.
[03:45:59.653 --> 03:46:07.582]  It's caused because of accumulation of the spike protein from the infection and in a massive doses from the vaccine.
[03:46:07.923 --> 03:46:09.344]  It gets stuck in the human body.
[03:46:09.665 --> 03:46:13.169]  We need to assist the body in clearing the spike protein.
[03:46:13.189 --> 03:46:14.771]  We have several years of observation.
[03:46:15.211 --> 03:46:17.192]  Multiple peer-reviewed publications on this.
[03:46:17.352 --> 03:46:18.893]  Very good support for doing this.
[03:46:19.333 --> 03:46:24.156]  It's natokinase, which is a natural enzyme derived from the fermentation of soy.
[03:46:24.196 --> 03:46:25.277]  Japanese discovered it.
[03:46:25.857 --> 03:46:29.479]  Bromelain, a family of enzymes derived from the stems of pineapple.
[03:46:29.919 --> 03:46:33.481]  And then lastly, curcumin, derived from turmeric and Indian spice.
[03:46:33.501 --> 03:46:35.202]  These are all in capsule format.
[03:46:35.543 --> 03:46:40.205]  We give them in combination in between meals, and we're using accelerating doses.
[03:46:40.305 --> 03:46:43.247]  People are doing this across the world right now, Alex.
[03:46:43.587 --> 03:46:44.288]  So you build up?
[03:46:44.628 --> 03:46:45.349]  And we build up.
[03:46:45.389 --> 03:46:49.332]  Now listen, the initial starting doses were 2,000 units twice a day of natto.
[03:46:49.352 --> 03:46:51.514]  We're now going to 4,000 twice a day.
[03:46:51.774 --> 03:46:57.238]  We do give them in addition to blood thinners, and we have found sometimes it's the only way to dissolve the blood clots.
[03:46:57.499 --> 03:47:01.202]  When people get large vaccine blood clots, the blood thinners just hold it steady.
[03:47:01.422 --> 03:47:02.403]  They don't dissolve them.
[03:47:02.663 --> 03:47:08.628]  We actually have to give thrombolytic enzymes, that's McCullough protocol, base spike protein detoxification.
[03:47:08.988 --> 03:47:12.872]  And people can find out all the details of that at OnlineHealthNow.com.
[03:47:13.172 --> 03:47:14.253]  That's the go-to place.
[03:47:14.273 --> 03:47:19.599]  The wellness company provides, you know, really the leading quality and the leading formulation.
[03:47:19.639 --> 03:47:23.222]  So the spike formulation has not only natal kinase, but five minor ingredients.
[03:47:23.423 --> 03:47:30.690]  We combine that with the curcumin and the bromelain for what we think is the ultimate spike detox trio.
