[00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:19.233]  It's Wednesday, July 24th, 2024.
[00:00:19.493 --> 00:00:23.316]  This is a special edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:28.159]  Massive breaking news on the globalist coup against America and the world coming up.
[00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:37.427]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:37.447 --> 00:00:40.788]  103 days, 12 hours, 59 minutes, 44 seconds.
[00:00:41.588 --> 00:00:45.049]  The most important election in world history, then the 79 days of hell.
[00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:54.010]  When Trump wins, if he's able to defeat, if we're able to stop the election fraud, they swing in with massive civil unrest they've already got announced and planned.
[00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.131]  This is it, the big one.
[00:00:56.611 --> 00:01:04.180]   We don't stop this, We don't get ahead of this in the info war, the enemy will take us into full civil war.
[00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:06.022]  We'll still win, but it's going to be hard.
[00:01:07.363 --> 00:01:10.346]  Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of good news is unfolding.
[00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:19.275]  A lot of members of Congress are openly saying, we know the deep state did this and the new world order looks scared for the first time in a long time because people aren't buying their BS.
[00:01:21.337 --> 00:01:22.138]  I'm just going to say it.
[00:01:23.396 --> 00:01:29.623]  Are you aware, sir, that many Americans believe this was very likely not a lone shooter, but a coordinated assassination attempt?
[00:01:30.124 --> 00:01:32.286]  Have you been getting those messages from people like I have?
[00:01:32.707 --> 00:01:33.268]  I have not, sir.
[00:01:33.868 --> 00:01:34.189]  You haven't?
[00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:37.573]  Well, there's a lot of people in this room that have been getting the same messages.
[00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:39.335]  Why do you think that is?
[00:01:39.435 --> 00:01:41.177]  Why do you think that a lot of Americans are like...
[00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:42.218]  This doesn't add up.
[00:01:42.238 --> 00:01:43.519]  This doesn't make sense, guys.
[00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.401]  How could this many things have gone wrong?
[00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:47.161]  Right?
[00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:48.322]  Like the things I pointed out.
[00:01:48.342 --> 00:02:01.571]  A 20-year-old kid, 150, got 150 yards of the President of the United States with an AR-15, flew a drone to conduct site surveillance, was spotted with a rangefinder, ranging targets, then lost.
[00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:05.114]  Had advanced explosive devices on him.
[00:02:05.994 --> 00:02:12.498]  With no military training, nobody was placed in the most obvious spot to conduct counter-sniper operations.
[00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:14.619]  I was a sniper in the SEAL Team's kernel.
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.502]  As soon as I got out of the SUV and I saw that sniper, that water tower, I was like, that's exactly where I'd be.
[00:02:20.743 --> 00:02:21.523]  Put me right there.
[00:02:22.343 --> 00:02:22.984]  So obvious.
[00:02:23.524 --> 00:02:39.000]   After partisan attempts to bankrupt him, imprison him for 750 years, and countless depictions as a modern-day Hitler, are you surprised, sir, that a lot of Americans are like, Maybe there's more to this story?
[00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:42.603]  I wouldn't begin to speculate about what the American people think, sir.
[00:02:43.364 --> 00:02:49.851]  Colonel, did your team make entry and conduct investigation at the suspect's home prior to this shooting?
[00:02:52.253 --> 00:02:52.774]  Excuse me, sir?
[00:02:52.854 --> 00:02:53.274]  I'll pass it.
[00:02:53.535 --> 00:02:57.058]  Did your team make entry and conduct any investigation at the suspect's home?
[00:02:58.072 --> 00:03:04.560]  I believe we had people that participated in that securing of it.
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.043]  There were bomb assets that we provided.
[00:03:07.183 --> 00:03:08.805]  Mr. Chairman, can I have 30 more seconds?
[00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:10.707]  Yeah, yeah, I'm letting everybody come.
[00:03:10.827 --> 00:03:11.027]  Okay.
[00:03:11.768 --> 00:03:18.076]  On the night of, since then, none... Did you get any reports from any of your agents of anything fishy at the home?
[00:03:20.478 --> 00:03:21.319]  I was briefed on.
[00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:24.985]  Was there any silverware found in the home or trash?
[00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:27.488]  I have nothing in the briefing that I was given.
[00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.332]  Was it extremely clean, almost like a medical lab?
[00:03:30.893 --> 00:03:31.895]  Were you given any of those reports?
[00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:33.177]  I was not given any of those details.
[00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:34.358]  Okay, that's what I'm hearing.
[00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:35.519]  Interesting.
[00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.519]  [SIREN]
[00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.519]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.519]  Just a good old boy.
[00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.519]  Never meanin' no harm.
[00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.519]  Beats all you never saw.
[00:03:55.116 --> 00:03:58.179]  Been in trouble with the law since the day they was born.
[00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.502]  Straightenin' the curves.
[00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:07.908]  Flattenin' the hills.
[00:04:07.788 --> 00:04:11.788]  Someday the mountain might get 'em, but the law never will.
[00:04:11.788 --> 00:04:18.788]  They're making their way, the only way they know how.
[00:04:18.788 --> 00:04:24.788]  That's just a little bit more than the normal and vow.
[00:04:24.788 --> 00:04:27.367]  (upbeat music)
[00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.061]  Just a good old boss.
[00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:34.083]  Wouldn't change if they could.
[00:04:34.443 --> 00:04:37.725]  Fighting the system like a true modern day Robin Hood.
[00:04:39.989 --> 00:04:40.690]  Damn right!
[00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.371]  Woo!
[00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:43.473]  Ha ha ha!
[00:04:43.954 --> 00:04:45.115]  Good job to that meme team.
[00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:53.324]  All right, we got huge, massive news coming up, ladies and gentlemen, on this live Wednesday, July 24, 24 transmission.
[00:04:54.565 --> 00:04:56.267]  So much coming up in 60 seconds.
[00:04:56.307 --> 00:04:57.328]  I'll tell you all about it.
[00:04:57.348 --> 00:04:59.931]  We're going to open the phones up and do a live Spaces.
[00:05:00.612 --> 00:05:06.013]  So we're going to talk to the American people and others straight ahead in T-minus 60 seconds.
[00:05:06.053 --> 00:05:10.135]  Make sure to follow me at RealAlexJones and check out our website, InfoWars.com.
[00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:11.075]  You may not have heard of it.
[00:05:11.755 --> 00:05:15.796]  Well, I've got a big problem on this July 24th live Wednesday transmission.
[00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:19.737]  There's just too much news, too much incredible stuff to cover.
[00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:25.979]  And it also cleared the slate of most of the guests because I wanted to open up an X spaces for people to comment on the state of the world.
[00:05:27.806 --> 00:05:32.632]  11 days after the attempted assassination of Trump and Biden stepping down to give a speech tonight.
[00:05:32.652 --> 00:05:36.456]  We'll have live coverage here with Owen Schroer, 730 Central.
[00:05:36.496 --> 00:05:41.101]  He'll just continue the war room on through the announcement and then afterwards take your calls and comments.
[00:05:41.121 --> 00:05:45.535]   We'll do a space X deal a spaces on X.
[00:05:45.535 --> 00:05:48.935]   So many X things he wants doing for to keep track of all of them.
[00:05:48.935 --> 00:05:50.374]  X marks the spot.
[00:05:50.374 --> 00:05:51.655]  So that's coming up.
[00:05:51.655 --> 00:05:54.375]   So we'll just have live coverage until like 10 o'clock tonight, or
[00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:55.535]  at least nine o'clock tonight.
[00:05:55.535 --> 00:05:59.375]  Just rolling on from 8:00 AM this morning.
[00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:03.575]   When Chase guys are hosting the American journal, uh, right through
[00:06:03.575 --> 00:06:05.935]  until this evening with Owen.
[00:06:05.935 --> 00:06:07.255]  And there's a good chance.
[00:06:07.255 --> 00:06:11.534]   I'm going to go home and see the family a little bit and then, uh, come
[00:06:11.534 --> 00:06:17.135]  back and be part of that as well because it is historic.
[00:06:16.298 --> 00:06:16.638]  Okay.
[00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:26.141]  Incredible ongoing testimony of the FBI director in front of Congress trying to whitewash the attempted assassination 11 days ago.
[00:06:27.622 --> 00:06:30.683]  Amazing levels of rewriting history in 1984 level gaslighting.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:40.484]  Where there's running headlines everywhere, fact-checking, Kamala Harris was never a border czar, she was never in charge of the border, it's a right-wing lie.
[00:06:41.144 --> 00:06:51.229]  Now, that's like saying the river that runs through by Virginia and Maryland is not the Potomac.
[00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:54.871]  It's like saying the Grand Canyon is not in Arizona.
[00:06:55.951 --> 00:06:58.552]  It's like saying the Statue of Liberty isn't on Staten Island.
[00:06:58.592 --> 00:07:06.869]   I mean, it's just I mean, even the dumbest person has to know that she was the Borders are for the last three and a half years.
[00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.673]  And we have the articles and videos him announcing her press conferences, and they're just like, it's not true.
[00:07:11.893 --> 00:07:12.593]  It's all lies.
[00:07:12.653 --> 00:07:13.334]  Right wing evil.
[00:07:14.915 --> 00:07:17.276]  The corporate media knows people don't believe them anymore.
[00:07:17.316 --> 00:07:19.838]  They just culture jam to create confusion.
[00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:21.799]  Next level.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.142]  DNC to coordinate Harris weeks before convention via rule change.
[00:07:26.162 --> 00:07:27.783]  I talked to Roger Stone this morning.
[00:07:27.803 --> 00:07:28.864]  He says it's too soon to tell.
[00:07:28.884 --> 00:07:29.925]  I'll have more intel tomorrow.
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.222]  And we'll be joining us, but they still may try to double-cross her.
[00:07:35.642 --> 00:07:37.884]  Because again, things are fluid, things are unfolding.
[00:07:37.944 --> 00:07:41.786]  Obama still has not endorsed her, even though she's brought Obama and Eric Holder in to run.
[00:07:41.806 --> 00:07:47.649]  The setting up of her administration ahead of time, and the vetting of the Vice Presidents.
[00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:49.810]  And the VP choice.
[00:07:51.091 --> 00:07:54.273]  So we've got Trump saying he's willing to debate Harris multiple times.
[00:07:55.336 --> 00:08:00.617]  Again, Biden to address the nation, primetime speech tonight, 7.30 Central, 8.30 Eastern.
[00:08:00.657 --> 00:08:05.479]  He'll probably be an hour late, like he was to the so-called press conference he gave a few weeks ago.
[00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:11.120]  Again, Axios, Harris, border confusion haunts her new campaign.
[00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:16.422]  And they say she was never a border czar, it's just the Republicans are just stupid.
[00:08:17.262 --> 00:08:18.222]  They're just confused.
[00:08:18.262 --> 00:08:25.372]   We have all the articles and videos where she was announced as The borders are just unbelievable.
[00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:29.214]  Trump plans to stop holding outdoor rallies after assassination attempt.
[00:08:30.675 --> 00:08:36.317]  I think that is smart, because let's just say the leadership of the Secret Service is not on his side.
[00:08:36.337 --> 00:08:39.019]  There are going to be a lot of people trying to kill Trump now.
[00:08:39.959 --> 00:08:47.543]  Trump in real polls is 20 plus points ahead, but they're spinning it like, oh, Harris is in a dead heat with him, and whoo, there's big excitement about Harris.
[00:08:48.063 --> 00:08:57.642]   And so I remember the last Five years of her on the radar, you know, when she was running for president and then was picked as the VP and then they stole the election almost four years ago.
[00:08:59.483 --> 00:09:03.984]  But now that people are putting a spotlight back on her, it reminded me she's even worse than I thought.
[00:09:04.004 --> 00:09:17.027]  I mean, she's such an evil, stupid person at the same time, cackling witch, and totally fake in every way, that it's really hard to even try to grasp it.
[00:09:18.635 --> 00:09:22.957]  More than 20 clips here of her making an absolute fool of herself, and there's just hundreds more.
[00:09:24.218 --> 00:09:26.419]  My eyes were bleeding this morning, sending these to the crew.
[00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:33.402]  Just clip after clip after clip after clip after clip of the most insane crap you've ever witnessed.
[00:09:34.483 --> 00:09:44.188]  And then they're spinning it that she's black, and the Republican leadership's like, well, let's not make it about the fact that she's a diversity hire.
[00:09:46.254 --> 00:09:48.255]  Because, I mean, there's plenty of black women that could be president.
[00:09:48.275 --> 00:09:48.716]  They're smart.
[00:09:48.736 --> 00:09:50.417]  But this lady certainly isn't black.
[00:09:52.178 --> 00:09:54.380]  And she certainly isn't smart.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.042]  I mean, it's just at every level, it's fraud upon fraud.
[00:09:58.142 --> 00:10:04.187]  It's like saying that that particular U.S.
[00:10:04.247 --> 00:10:07.989]  Senator is a Native American, and then they went and checked her lineage.
[00:10:08.049 --> 00:10:09.610]  Zero Native American.
[00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.111]  Not even 1%.
[00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:11.151]  Most people have at least 1%.
[00:10:12.292 --> 00:10:12.993]  Remember Pocahontas?
[00:10:14.463 --> 00:10:18.024]  So she's as big a fraud as I've ever seen.
[00:10:19.004 --> 00:10:22.966]  We've got a bunch of new information on the attempted assassination of Trump.
[00:10:24.186 --> 00:10:25.266]  The body cam footage.
[00:10:25.286 --> 00:10:29.107]  More and more experts saying at least two shooters.
[00:10:30.748 --> 00:10:33.389]  The Secret Service on local police body cam.
[00:10:34.609 --> 00:10:37.630]  Basically talking about how they had him on camera but didn't do anything.
[00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.811]  And then now I've looked at the different videos shot by citizens.
[00:10:41.918 --> 00:10:50.538]   Versus the body cam and you see a man in shorts Up there and then you see in another video a man in pants
[00:10:50.538 --> 00:10:56.558]   that's dead So this gives me a headache because none of it matches up
[00:10:56.558 --> 00:11:05.499]   and is just incredibly Hard to believe that they just sat there for at least 26
[00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:07.918]   minutes while this guy is roaming around the roof of the rifle
[00:11:08.558 --> 00:11:15.658]   And people are pointing at him and there's a secret service command center with open windows 50 feet maximum away from
[00:11:15.658 --> 00:11:18.888]   him While he's on this basically flat roof right in front of
[00:11:18.888 --> 00:11:29.119]   him [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:11:20.623 --> 00:11:29.610]   I mean, I could, with a handgun, a good handgun, I could shoot that guy in the nose at 50 feet.
[00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.810]  I could shoot him in the left eye.
[00:11:33.851 --> 00:11:34.911]  Just laser.
[00:11:36.031 --> 00:11:38.411]  With some of these handguns they've got now, but I'm digressing.
[00:11:39.312 --> 00:11:43.893]  You've seen the videos where I go out at 100 yards with a handgun, with like a 5-inch steel plate.
[00:11:44.113 --> 00:11:49.014]  I'm going cling, cling, cling, cling, cling, cling, cling, cling, cling.
[00:11:49.034 --> 00:11:49.754]  100 yards.
[00:11:50.514 --> 00:11:50.994]  Football field.
[00:11:51.994 --> 00:12:00.518]   The Secret Service is up there with high-powered rifles and they can't I mean, he can shoot people at half mile away with those easy, and they can't shoot this guy?
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.122]  Oh my God, it gives me, it actually is giving me a headache.
[00:12:08.342 --> 00:12:20.108]  But thank God that horrible woman, head of the Secret Service, Cheetle, all the names Cheetle and Crooks and, sorry if your name's Cheetle or Crooks, but just come on.
[00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:28.162]   These names, Cheetle, Crooks, uh, We're not being told the truth about what happened.
[00:12:29.783 --> 00:12:31.824]  There's definitely two shooters, the acoustics show that.
[00:12:32.804 --> 00:12:34.005]  That is completely crazy.
[00:12:34.025 --> 00:12:36.166]  We're going to be going over all that today.
[00:12:36.186 --> 00:12:41.368]  And then we've got all the stuff we're being distracted from, the economic news, the military news, you've got Netanyahu.
[00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:47.331]  Just had to speak to Congress and all the communists, people ready to riot and burn everything down.
[00:12:47.351 --> 00:12:52.854]  And it's the same Democratic Party that totally supports Israel, but then their constituents hate Israel.
[00:12:53.897 --> 00:12:57.160]  And again, I just see Israel as like one more corrupt country, just like the United States.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.463]  I mean, their leadership is super corrupt, selling the U.S.
[00:13:00.523 --> 00:13:01.104]  out to China.
[00:13:02.327 --> 00:13:07.350]  Standing down on October 7th, doing all sorts of stuff, but I don't have a fetish to hate Jews in general.
[00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:11.632]  I don't have a fetish, you know, just to go, oh, that's the most evil thing in the world.
[00:13:12.073 --> 00:13:17.856]  But at the same time, you've got the sycophantic worship of Israel, that it can do no wrong, and you just don't even question it.
[00:13:18.276 --> 00:13:21.958]  Let them influence our politics, and they're definitely one of the biggest groups doing that.
[00:13:21.998 --> 00:13:23.639]  It's terrible, the Israeli government.
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:37.766]   And then you've also got the communists, the leftists, and the Squad, the other side, who are As bad as you can be, I mean, as a group of just miscreant communist ne'er-do-well scumbags.
[00:13:37.867 --> 00:13:41.048]  And it's just like, oh, what a horror show.
[00:13:42.168 --> 00:13:46.650]  What an absolute horror show that we see ourselves in the middle of.
[00:13:47.671 --> 00:13:53.053]  So we're going to do a Spaces on X that we'll go live with in about 15-20 minutes.
[00:13:54.114 --> 00:13:56.835]  And then most people announce these days before and build them up.
[00:13:56.855 --> 00:14:01.815]   We just do them because it's great to get the HD audio of people that are on X to be able to call in.
[00:14:01.815 --> 00:14:05.835]   To me, I use it as a phone call system just to get some great comments.
[00:14:05.835 --> 00:14:10.575]   But we have done some, we've promoted for a few days that have gotten millions of listeners.
[00:14:10.575 --> 00:14:13.574]   Nothing like the one I did with Elon Musk for two and a half hours that had
[00:14:13.574 --> 00:14:16.693]  50 million at the end of it.
[00:14:16.693 --> 00:14:19.374]   20 million, 25 million that day, but 50 million by the end of the week.
[00:14:19.374 --> 00:14:20.995]  The clip's got another 100 million.
[00:14:20.995 --> 00:14:24.295]   I'm gonna do another one of those and I think one might be getting worked on.
[00:14:24.295 --> 00:14:25.214]  One might happen soon.
[00:14:25.214 --> 00:14:28.455]  We'll see if I'm back on with Elon anytime soon here.
[00:14:28.582 --> 00:14:31.965]  You'll certainly get his doppelganger, uh, Adrian Dittman, on today.
[00:14:32.465 --> 00:14:33.486]  But, uh, that's coming up.
[00:14:34.727 --> 00:14:40.533]  And we'll also open up the phone system, uh, and take your calls on the assassination 11 days ago.
[00:14:40.573 --> 00:14:43.355]  And now the media wants to move on, wants to glaze over it.
[00:14:43.876 --> 00:14:46.478]  I shot a report on this, but I forgot to send it to the crew.
[00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:47.960]  It's in my larger report.
[00:14:50.105 --> 00:14:50.946]  But Rob has it.
[00:14:51.186 --> 00:14:57.708]  Get me the clip of Jim Acosta saying, how dare Trump say the Secret Service didn't do a perfect job?
[00:14:58.969 --> 00:15:00.489]  This is just outrageous.
[00:15:00.549 --> 00:15:04.811]  It's like saying, how dare a mother lead her three-year-old across the street?
[00:15:06.371 --> 00:15:08.532]  Or how dare someone put their kid in a seat belter?
[00:15:09.472 --> 00:15:15.315]  I mean, literally, the Secret Service stood down bare minimum criminal neglect.
[00:15:16.655 --> 00:15:18.596]  The consensus has formed, obviously, inside job.
[00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:31.045]  And then crawling out from under a rock, Acosta, you haven't seen in years, of course nobody watches CNN, he's not hosting shows, he crawls out from under a rock and attacks Trump.
[00:15:31.065 --> 00:15:47.913]   It's in my larger report, Alex Jones issues emergency warning to Trump that I shot last night that has millions of views thanks to all of you taking everything we do at X, Alex Jones, and Band.Video and magnifying the living daylights out of it because let me tell you, you're not the tail You're not the dog.
[00:15:47.933 --> 00:15:48.934]  You're the tail and the dog.
[00:15:48.974 --> 00:15:50.255]  You're the whole shooting match.
[00:15:50.275 --> 00:15:55.418]  When you decide to get excited about something and take action, it is unstoppable.
[00:15:55.438 --> 00:15:58.400]  So I'm going to start getting into the shooting and the information there.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.722]  The name of the space is going to deal with 11 days after the Trump assassination.
[00:16:01.882 --> 00:16:02.583]  Major developments.
[00:16:03.043 --> 00:16:06.465]  We'll get into those major developments coming up here in about 16, 17 minutes.
[00:16:08.626 --> 00:16:15.691]   And we're also welcome to call in or be a speaker on X about Kamala, Biden disappearing.
[00:16:15.731 --> 00:16:18.773]  Now reportedly he's going to officially drop out of the race in a speech tonight.
[00:16:18.813 --> 00:16:22.656]  Not just that letter that wasn't even on the letterhead and wasn't even his signature.
[00:16:24.037 --> 00:16:29.181]  Looks like they pulled a dirty trick on him while he was drugged up or something, coming back from Vegas, which they meant was a medical emergency.
[00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:33.964]  While he was drugged up for a few days, went ahead and said, see, sorry, already resigned.
[00:16:33.984 --> 00:16:34.845]  No getting out of this now.
[00:16:35.706 --> 00:16:39.789]  And now they're all just trying to, reportedly, they meant he's been super mad throwing fits.
[00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:44.708]   But after six days, He emerges stumbling around.
[00:16:44.728 --> 00:16:46.130]  We've got the video of that coming up.
[00:16:47.431 --> 00:16:48.852]  And they say, you know, why'd you drop out?
[00:16:48.872 --> 00:16:51.415]  He goes, ha ha, yeah, like, yeah, I didn't drop out.
[00:16:52.476 --> 00:16:54.698]  So just absolutely insane.
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:03.207]  All the things that are going on, all the things that are happening, we're going to be getting to all of that, as I said, and a lot more here today.
[00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:10.334]  But I keep getting questions on the street, I keep getting questions by the crew, I keep getting questions everywhere.
[00:17:10.354 --> 00:17:12.736]  So I'm going to spend a few minutes on this, then I'm going to move on.
[00:17:14.137 --> 00:17:16.919]  I told you six weeks ago they tried to close this operation without a court order.
[00:17:17.556 --> 00:17:23.355]   Just department manipulating with court-appointed people to do it the judge found out fired them
[00:17:23.355 --> 00:17:28.096]   But not before it was all over the news that yes, we're gonna close it. Yes, it's over and yes, it's gone
[00:17:28.096 --> 00:17:33.655]   And then more headlines it all stopped two weeks ago You haven't heard of things since then
[00:17:33.655 --> 00:17:37.556]   That oh, I'll show to be liquidated It'll be off the air next week and I shot a video and I
[00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:41.175]   said watch I think we're gonna be around a few more months and
[00:17:41.175 --> 00:17:46.414]   there are some maneuvers and just a very good chance that
[00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:51.095]   We will be on the air right to the election and
[00:17:51.095 --> 00:18:01.297]   For the foreseeable future years and years But I don't want to give away all the strategy, the things that have been happening, but we have been hanging on by our fingernails.
[00:18:01.317 --> 00:18:04.540]  Your prayer, your support, it's all been essential, that's why we're still here.
[00:18:05.881 --> 00:18:10.146]  But, I mean, it's no secret, so I'll just say this part.
[00:18:11.513 --> 00:18:14.674]  The judge said, yeah, you're going to have an orderly liquidation because Jones has opted for that.
[00:18:14.714 --> 00:18:15.474]  It's all that's left.
[00:18:16.314 --> 00:18:19.255]  But then someone can buy the assets and we stay on air.
[00:18:20.595 --> 00:18:21.955]  And the judge now knows what's going on.
[00:18:21.975 --> 00:18:22.756]  They admitted the judge.
[00:18:22.776 --> 00:18:23.416]  We don't want him on air.
[00:18:23.456 --> 00:18:24.056]  We don't want money.
[00:18:25.316 --> 00:18:25.996]  We want him closed.
[00:18:26.656 --> 00:18:27.777]  He said, well, that's not my job.
[00:18:27.837 --> 00:18:28.377]  I'm not doing that.
[00:18:29.917 --> 00:18:47.148]   And so the court appointed a committee of the Democrat lawyers and their Clients has told the court and told the new trustee everybody we just want them off the air.
[00:18:47.168 --> 00:19:16.386]   We don't want money and they said well, that's not happening so At least right now So that's why it's critical that enough money come in to keep us on air because people think we're off the air Then money doesn't come in and then by their actions about people believing that we're off the air We're going off the air the support doesn't come in and then we do shut down so could it be your last chance to get x2 and x3 and All the great products like Nitric Boost and all of that at infowarestore.com.
[00:19:17.147 --> 00:19:19.747]  Yes, no more new product has been ordered.
[00:19:20.647 --> 00:19:21.648]  And what is there is there.
[00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:29.730]  And then if we get people that buy the assets and the operation continues on, they've got to then go back and rebuy all the product and fund us for the months it takes to get it in.
[00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.090]  And then we got to continue on.
[00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.131]  We're about to bring some sponsorship on to bridge the gap in that.
[00:19:34.171 --> 00:19:40.597]   So I'm just telling you the inside baseball that This could be your last chance.

[00:19:49.301 --> 00:19:53.563]  The Trump bulletproof shirt is available.

[00:19:55.164 --> 00:19:55.744]  Please get that.
[00:19:55.764 --> 00:19:56.464]  That's now been printed.

[00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.651]  I really appreciate you all for your past support and everything you've done.
[00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:39.648]   What we do have plenty of, and it's great products, is a private label line That's called InfoWarsMD.
[00:20:40.329 --> 00:20:48.875]  I learned two years ago that one of our main suppliers of raw material to our sub supplier, one of our manufacturers, was Listeners and Patriots.
[00:20:49.296 --> 00:20:50.156]  I called the owner.
[00:20:50.557 --> 00:20:53.639]  It's a billion-dollar company, one of the major makers.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:20:55.521]  They said, listen, our whole line is yours.
[00:20:55.541 --> 00:20:58.463]  We just don't want to get in the middle of it politically, so just don't say our name.
[00:20:59.944 --> 00:21:07.216]   We will let you private label all of this Drop shipped out of their warehouse with like one day service.
[00:21:07.256 --> 00:21:09.397]  You order it and it ships in like a day or two, depending on the day.
[00:21:09.437 --> 00:21:11.099]  If you order on a Saturday, it doesn't ship on Sunday.
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.361]  And it's the exact same tumor.
[00:21:14.421 --> 00:21:15.142]  It's in bodies.
[00:21:15.622 --> 00:21:21.007]  Just to give you an example, they had the Nitric Boost was their product.
[00:21:21.787 --> 00:21:24.970]  And we said, well, we could fund ourselves and we can go make that somewhere else.
[00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:26.271]  They said, sure, just have the product.
[00:21:26.731 --> 00:21:27.352]  That's how nice they were.
[00:21:28.573 --> 00:21:29.454]  So we went and made that.
[00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:33.297]  But all they do is tack three to four dollars on every order.
[00:21:34.617 --> 00:21:37.119]  And it's bottled, they put our label on it, everything.
[00:21:37.159 --> 00:21:43.742]  So we've got our costs, they get their three to four bucks, and then we put, you know, markup on it so we can fund ourselves.
[00:21:44.182 --> 00:21:47.404]  So you're literally getting a top-of-the-line supplement line.
[00:21:48.385 --> 00:21:51.447]  I mean, they've got over a hundred products, so I think we've probably labeled 15 or so.
[00:21:53.186 --> 00:21:54.547]  Their joint relief is amazing.
[00:21:54.627 --> 00:21:56.188]  Their prostate support is amazing.
[00:21:56.268 --> 00:21:57.449]  Their nerve renew is amazing.
[00:21:57.489 --> 00:21:58.689]  Their good night's sleep is amazing.
[00:21:58.729 --> 00:22:00.310]  Their ashwagandha products are amazing.
[00:22:01.011 --> 00:22:04.433]  It's InfoWars MD, private labeled, and they got plenty of it.
[00:22:05.113 --> 00:22:11.437]  Showing the products, when our original products that are amazing sell out in the next month, we will have InfoWars MD as the funding mechanism.
[00:22:12.118 --> 00:22:12.998]  So get to know it.
[00:22:13.318 --> 00:22:16.840]  It's been already popular, but this is what we got left to fund the operation.
[00:22:18.321 --> 00:22:19.282]  So thank you for your support.
[00:22:20.214 --> 00:22:21.414]  At InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:22:21.434 --> 00:22:23.335]  The prostate support's amazing, great formula.
[00:22:23.995 --> 00:22:30.537]  Even the FDA admits that this formula with the soft pot metal and these other compounds actually does massively reduce issues with the prostate.
[00:22:31.137 --> 00:22:31.777]  This stuff works.
[00:22:33.217 --> 00:22:36.918]  So they've got great probiotics, prebiotics, they've got enzymes.
[00:22:37.558 --> 00:22:38.079]  It's amazing.
[00:22:38.159 --> 00:22:42.760]  InfoWarsMD, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:53.430]   And then in closing, There's our other great sponsor, and that's a warehouse in North Austin and Round Rock that my dad owns.
[00:22:53.871 --> 00:22:59.372]  He decided, without telling me almost three years ago, when he saw all these attacks, to go set up his own warehouse.
[00:22:59.632 --> 00:23:01.093]  He developed most of the supplements for us.
[00:23:01.113 --> 00:23:04.214]  He's got a chemistry and medical degree background.
[00:23:05.163 --> 00:23:10.026]  And he went with top developers and made a bunch of new products, not just the ones that we had at InfoWars.
[00:23:10.907 --> 00:23:11.807]  And they're all there.
[00:23:11.827 --> 00:23:23.815]  The NanoSilver products, incredible sleep aids, incredible multivitamin organic-based, great concentrated green fiber caps, the concentrated seed sprouts, amazing formula.
[00:23:24.415 --> 00:23:27.177]  So many great formulas at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:23:27.357 --> 00:23:29.158]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:23:29.178 --> 00:23:31.200]   But listen, We're at the tip of the spear.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.322]  You saw Trump get shot.
[00:23:32.682 --> 00:23:34.184]  You've seen the Feds trying to shut us down.
[00:23:34.225 --> 00:23:35.266]  You've seen all hell breaking loose.
[00:23:35.666 --> 00:23:43.858]  It takes money to have this crew and the satellite up links and to be on radio stations, TV stations, you know, our own big servers for back when we were being censored everywhere.
[00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.552]  We've been fighting hard, and it takes money to win a war.
[00:23:47.572 --> 00:23:48.573]  And this is an info war.
[00:23:49.093 --> 00:23:57.380]  And I can tell you, the info I put out, I see picked up word for word by the presidency, the real presidency, by Trump's crew, by Trump, and by Congress.
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.121]  And I know they listen because I talk to them.
[00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:00.562]  I'm not going to brag, I just want you to know.
[00:24:01.283 --> 00:24:10.073]   We've got a direct line, not just to tens of millions of people, the general public, which is great, we have a direct line Into the U.S., real U.S.
[00:24:10.113 --> 00:24:11.734]  government, Trump, the real executive branch.
[00:24:11.774 --> 00:24:12.835]  We have a direct line.
[00:24:12.875 --> 00:24:14.897]  They listen to everything we say.
[00:24:14.917 --> 00:24:17.559]  I'm very humbled, and I appreciate that respect.
[00:24:18.059 --> 00:24:20.301]  But they know I've called it so much.
[00:24:20.781 --> 00:24:29.928]  I mean, I talk to high-level people, and it's bizarre to have, like, 60-, 70-year-old men saying, yes, sir, to me, and saying, what do we do?
[00:24:31.363 --> 00:24:35.425]  And a lot of it is they already know all this, but they take it as an authority when I say it.
[00:24:36.186 --> 00:24:37.386]  And God has put me in this position.
[00:24:38.387 --> 00:24:39.127]  And I'm not perfect.
[00:24:39.748 --> 00:24:40.968]  Plus, the enemy changes their plans.
[00:24:41.189 --> 00:24:47.952]  And that's my plan, is to expose their plan so that they're so exposed and so freaked out that they back off.
[00:24:47.972 --> 00:24:51.494]  I don't want to just keep making predictions that come true, so I'm like, oh, I'm so smart.
[00:24:51.775 --> 00:24:52.995]  That makes me a target, folks.
[00:24:53.055 --> 00:24:54.216]  I'm fully immersed in this.
[00:24:54.256 --> 00:24:55.357]  I'm in the enemy's mind.
[00:24:56.137 --> 00:24:57.098]  I study them constantly.
[00:24:57.118 --> 00:24:57.578]  It's what I do.
[00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:04.503]  And I'm just telling you, you cannot buy product and support a product, because they took all our sponsors 15 years ago.
[00:25:04.763 --> 00:25:06.564]  So I went, well, I'll just go make our own.
[00:25:07.865 --> 00:25:16.250]  We'll make our own t-shirts and sell our own knives and sell our own belt buckles and sell our own bumper stickers and sell our own books and films and supplements.
[00:25:17.231 --> 00:25:18.892]  And I took the money and put it into the operation.
[00:25:20.272 --> 00:25:22.574]  Then they lied about it and said, oh, he doesn't need your support.
[00:25:22.614 --> 00:25:23.214]  He's got $400 million.
[00:25:25.221 --> 00:25:26.221]  He's gonna go to jail.
[00:25:26.281 --> 00:25:28.242]  You saw it all in federal court, federal appointed.
[00:25:28.842 --> 00:25:34.684]  Auditors came in here, checked everything and said, Alex Jones has got a tiny lake house, 127 acres and another house.
[00:25:36.344 --> 00:25:38.205]  You know, not very fancy, but it's nice.
[00:25:38.765 --> 00:25:39.666]  And he's got two cars.
[00:25:41.186 --> 00:25:44.527]  And, oh, New York Times, it turned out Jones has meager assets.
[00:25:45.527 --> 00:25:48.208]  I've been living like a king with a little swimming pool.
[00:25:48.988 --> 00:25:54.787]   My swimming pool's not even big, but it's, you know, it's about It's about 30 feet long.
[00:25:54.807 --> 00:25:55.507]  That's pretty big.
[00:25:55.547 --> 00:25:59.229]  Big enough to cool off and big enough to, you know, play water volleyball in.
[00:25:59.249 --> 00:26:03.251]  But I would give all that up today, and I have given most of it up, for freedom.
[00:26:03.271 --> 00:26:03.992]  I don't care about that.
[00:26:04.012 --> 00:26:04.872]  I'm willing to give my life up.
[00:26:05.553 --> 00:26:09.975]  But if I don't have the funding from you, I cannot do it.
[00:26:09.995 --> 00:26:16.919]  So just commit to support the broadcast at drjonesandnicholls.com and at infowarshore.com.
[00:26:17.239 --> 00:26:22.967]   And then I won't have to sit here And beat you over the head with a bunch of sponsors, like all the talk radio shows.
[00:26:23.367 --> 00:26:30.110]  The other talk radio has four or five plugs an hour, and it's coming in to break, going out of break, and I get it.
[00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:32.130]  It's a hard market to fund themselves, they got to do it.
[00:26:32.971 --> 00:26:36.052]  With me, you usually get a big plug in the first hour, maybe two little plugs later.
[00:26:36.912 --> 00:26:42.014]  I don't want to sit here and plug stuff, but it is great products you need, but I cannot do it without you.
[00:26:43.294 --> 00:26:51.044]   So just mark it in your calendar, put it on the refrigerator door, And say, hey, support Alex if that's what you choose.
[00:26:52.724 --> 00:26:54.104]  Because we'll do what your church is going to do.
[00:26:54.144 --> 00:26:55.105]  We'll fight for life.
[00:26:55.145 --> 00:26:56.125]  We'll fight the Satanist.
[00:26:56.585 --> 00:26:57.625]  We'll take on the New World Order.
[00:26:57.685 --> 00:26:59.025]  And I might say a cuss word occasionally.
[00:26:59.286 --> 00:26:59.826]  I'm not a fake.
[00:27:00.206 --> 00:27:01.186]  But I'll definitely fight the devil.
[00:27:03.267 --> 00:27:04.747]  Maybe you tithe to this broadcast.
[00:27:04.787 --> 00:27:05.867]  Part of your, you know, tithe.
[00:27:06.127 --> 00:27:06.927]  Whatever it is.
[00:27:06.947 --> 00:27:10.008]  I got preachers on almost every day.
[00:27:11.328 --> 00:27:13.609]  You don't see that in the rest of conservative talk radio.
[00:27:13.649 --> 00:27:16.450]  I mean, I don't depend on Jesus.
[00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:17.550]  Jesus is everything.
[00:27:19.858 --> 00:27:20.899]  Jesus isn't number one.
[00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:21.479]  He's everything.
[00:27:23.701 --> 00:27:24.582]  But I need your support.
[00:27:24.902 --> 00:27:25.403]  Please commit.
[00:27:25.443 --> 00:27:26.704]  I want to thank those that have kept us on air.
[00:27:26.724 --> 00:27:27.845]  It's been one hell of a battle.
[00:27:27.865 --> 00:27:30.167]  And when you fought this hard for something, you don't want to give it up.
[00:27:30.427 --> 00:27:31.067]  So pray for us.
[00:27:31.087 --> 00:27:31.828]  That's most important.
[00:27:32.208 --> 00:27:34.830]  And commit to drjonesnaturals.com and infowars.com.
[00:27:35.391 --> 00:27:36.332]  And support our great sponsors.
[00:27:37.488 --> 00:27:46.616]  We'll be right back with all the big news and so much more on the assassination attempt 11 days later and on Biden stepping down and so much more.
[00:27:46.676 --> 00:27:47.197]  Please stay with us.
[00:27:47.597 --> 00:27:52.901]  So there's the Infowars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:27:53.062 --> 00:27:58.566]  Whether it's turmeric or whether it's natural sleep aid or whether it's saw palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate.
[00:27:58.927 --> 00:28:00.428]  Also great for women's breasts.
[00:28:00.848 --> 00:28:02.690]  It affects the same type of tissues.
[00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.052]  And you know, that's a little bit old, that chart.
[00:28:04.932 --> 00:28:11.332]   but I read the literature. You need to go to Infowarsstore.com and go to the sections
[00:28:11.332 --> 00:28:16.051]  that have the whole line over a dozen products, Infowars MD.
[00:28:16.051 --> 00:28:20.770]   And you know, that's a little bit old, that chart. That chart's a couple of months
[00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:25.490]   old and if you wanna really see something that's said, take a look at what happened.
[00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:52.572]   The globalist deep state wants us to stay focused on all the division they're trying
[00:28:52.572 --> 00:28:58.092]   to create in America along racial lines, religious lines, sexual orientation lines.
[00:28:58.082 --> 00:29:04.804]  They want us to forget about the attempted assassination of Trump 11 days ago, but nobody's forgetting about it.
[00:29:05.771 --> 00:29:10.194]  And Congress isn't forgetting about it, and the governors aren't forgetting about it, and you and I aren't forgetting about it.
[00:29:11.715 --> 00:29:14.838]  And the consensus has formed that it was a deep state attempted assassination.
[00:29:14.858 --> 00:29:16.539]  They're going to try to kill Trump again.
[00:29:17.439 --> 00:29:19.261]  President Trump understands that and knows that.
[00:29:19.301 --> 00:29:28.187]  I've talked to the highest levels of his operation, and they are taking my advice and your advice and even the Secret Service advice to stop the outdoor rallies.
[00:29:29.088 --> 00:29:33.090]  We know you're tough, Trump, but we need to protect the king in a game of chess.
[00:29:34.059 --> 00:29:48.823]  And so Trump is not planning on holding any outdoor rallies for the foreseeable future, which is a very smart move that I've been calling for since 11 days ago when this happened, because they're going to be copycats.
[00:29:49.023 --> 00:29:53.185]  The Deep State might not even have to kill him, but copycats are going to try.
[00:29:55.045 --> 00:29:57.466]  But everything, their whole plan is get rid of Trump.
[00:29:59.026 --> 00:30:00.907]  That's how it was easy to predict they would try to kill him.
[00:30:02.321 --> 00:30:07.863]  With the demonization, the lies, the Russiagate, the impeachments, the lawfare, the criminal charges, the fake criminal conviction.
[00:30:08.844 --> 00:30:11.685]  All the different CIA people saying, we're gonna kill this guy on TV.
[00:30:13.426 --> 00:30:16.147]  And then now they let the shooter parade around forever while this happens.
[00:30:17.107 --> 00:30:22.029]  I'm gonna review some of this, the new developments of this body cam footage that Senator Grassley has released from the local police.
[00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:24.690]  With the Secret Service reporting what we already said.
[00:30:26.131 --> 00:30:28.392]  That they knew he was up there, let him parade around, nothing was done.
[00:30:30.299 --> 00:30:35.561]  Another area to look at is, in some videos he's got pants, in the other video he doesn't, he's wearing shorts.
[00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:38.722]  And we're going to do a special report on that right now.
[00:30:38.762 --> 00:30:51.927]  Rob Dews is clipping out the different photos and videos and body cams of what one guy laying down on the roof looks like with the long hair, plus the other guy shot in the head with long hair who doesn't have long pants on.
[00:30:53.228 --> 00:30:55.169]  So we're putting that together right now as well.
[00:30:55.189 --> 00:30:56.489]  We'll post that on X once we have it.
[00:30:56.509 --> 00:30:57.610]  We'll play it on air with commentary.
[00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:58.970]  We'll take that clip out and post it there.
[00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.131]  It'll probably get 10 million views.
[00:31:00.151 --> 00:31:03.792]  I mean, that's the good news is it's not just us.
[00:31:03.852 --> 00:31:06.553]  It's thousands of other people on X alone.
[00:31:08.394 --> 00:31:13.015]  We're getting 30 million views a day on our coverage of the attempted assassination.
[00:31:13.035 --> 00:31:14.396]  Just that, conservatively.
[00:31:15.816 --> 00:31:21.178]  And I see other videos everywhere that are just going totally viral.
[00:31:21.278 --> 00:31:22.479]  And then, of course, it comes out in the news.
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:28.223]  That on Instagram and on Facebook and on YouTube, they're burying them, aren't they?
[00:31:28.663 --> 00:31:39.189]  Just like on the day of the shooting, the 13th, 11 days ago, they said, oh, there was some noises and he fell down.
[00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:46.112]  And the memos came out from the corporate media, their minions being told, no, don't say it's an assassination.
[00:31:46.672 --> 00:31:49.274]  Well, they weren't able to sweep it under the rug.
[00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:54.489]  But we have Jim Acosta now saying, how dare Trump blame the Secret Service leadership?
[00:31:54.829 --> 00:31:55.930]  She just resigned.
[00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:59.311]  So this is a case point of gaslighting.
[00:31:59.591 --> 00:32:00.551]  But first, here's Tucker.
[00:32:01.032 --> 00:32:01.752]  This is important.
[00:32:02.652 --> 00:32:05.953]  From his RNC speech, but I saw it again this morning and thought, we need to play that again.
[00:32:06.373 --> 00:32:09.354]  Where he says, everything changed when they tried to kill Trump.
[00:32:09.434 --> 00:32:10.535]  He changed, we changed.
[00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:13.456]  People finally realize it's game time.
[00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:18.031]  They finally got urgent and realized, wow, this is war.
[00:32:18.772 --> 00:32:19.892]  Damn right it is, people.
[00:32:20.512 --> 00:32:23.373]  I mean, this is hardcore time.
[00:32:24.074 --> 00:32:25.454]  It's time to get hardcore.
[00:32:25.494 --> 00:32:25.894]  Here's Tucker.
[00:32:27.395 --> 00:32:33.877]  I watched the video of what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania, about 15, 50 times.
[00:32:34.938 --> 00:32:37.979]  I think I was one of about 8 billion people around the world who watched it.
[00:32:38.539 --> 00:32:43.221]  And the more I watched it, the more it struck me that everything was different.
[00:32:44.645 --> 00:32:45.306]  After that moment.
[00:32:45.806 --> 00:32:46.126]  Everything.
[00:32:46.146 --> 00:32:47.407]  This convention is different.
[00:32:47.928 --> 00:32:48.849]  The nation is different.
[00:32:48.869 --> 00:32:49.649]  The world is different.
[00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:50.950]  Donald Trump is different.
[00:32:52.091 --> 00:33:01.299]  When he stood up, after being shot in the face, bloodied, and put his hand up, I thought at that moment, that was a transformation.
[00:33:01.399 --> 00:33:02.920]  This was no longer a man.
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.763]  Well, I think that.
[00:33:05.983 --> 00:33:07.444]  I think it was divine intervention.
[00:33:07.524 --> 00:33:15.943]   But the effect that it had on Donald Trump He was no longer just a political party's nominee, or a former president, or a future president.
[00:33:16.864 --> 00:33:18.625]  This was the leader of a nation.
[00:33:21.107 --> 00:33:25.391]  And I think there's a difference.
[00:33:26.032 --> 00:33:30.876]  I've spent most of my life in Washington, where the president is at the top of the pyramid, everyone wants to be the president.
[00:33:31.817 --> 00:33:34.339]  But if you think about it, the presidency comes with great power, obviously.
[00:33:34.359 --> 00:33:40.932]   But if you think about it, that is a title That is bestowed by a process of some sort that can be subverted.
[00:33:40.952 --> 00:33:49.634]  And in the end it does not... Tucker Carlson there saying that the president after that assassination... Alright, that's good.
[00:33:50.174 --> 00:33:51.394]  I want to go back a few photos.
[00:33:51.454 --> 00:33:56.095]  The one where Trump looks like a turtle and he's got his bottom lip up over his mouth.
[00:34:00.236 --> 00:34:01.916]  Go back to the beginning of the photos.
[00:34:02.837 --> 00:34:03.997]  That's the face I make.
[00:34:05.046 --> 00:34:07.126]  When I'm really pissed off and determined.
[00:34:07.766 --> 00:34:08.787]  That face right there.
[00:34:09.647 --> 00:34:11.827]  If you see me coming at you with that face, you know you got a problem.
[00:34:12.647 --> 00:34:14.868]  And that is the face of total determination.
[00:34:14.888 --> 00:34:17.468]  I've seen a lot of other men in really serious situations.
[00:34:18.248 --> 00:34:19.209]  That's the face you make.
[00:34:19.229 --> 00:34:21.009]  Yeah, that face right there.
[00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:24.069]  That's the real face of determination.
[00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:32.871]  Anytime you get in a fight with somebody and they got that look on their face, that means somebody switched on for war.
[00:34:34.356 --> 00:34:37.396]   And look how calm this other Secret Service agent is over here.
[00:34:37.396 --> 00:34:43.836]  Go back to the earlier photo too.
[00:34:43.821 --> 00:34:45.462]  It's even better when we're making him the turtle face.
[00:34:47.903 --> 00:34:51.024]  And I say that because you got the turtle with the lower jaw kind of up over it.
[00:34:52.085 --> 00:34:52.925]  Just roll through that again.
[00:34:52.945 --> 00:34:53.486]  I've got to see it.
[00:34:54.326 --> 00:34:55.707]  Roll through the same images you were just showing.
[00:34:57.767 --> 00:34:58.748]  Comes up right after this.
[00:34:59.388 --> 00:35:01.009]  This is the face right here coming up.
[00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:02.990]  You're on X.
[00:35:05.575 --> 00:35:08.177]  Yeah, maybe you're doing different images than you had.
[00:35:08.197 --> 00:35:09.617]  It's the one that's the straight shot of him.
[00:35:10.558 --> 00:35:11.498]  It's the classic shot.
[00:35:12.299 --> 00:35:13.159]  The one that everybody has.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.000]  We'll get it.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:14.980]  We'll have it.
[00:35:16.261 --> 00:35:18.663]  But I digress here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:19.803 --> 00:35:27.368]  This is such a historic time and what unfolded here is so historic.
[00:35:29.309 --> 00:35:36.186]   And the globalists are never going to be able to put the genie Back in the bottle.
[00:35:38.428 --> 00:35:40.148]  Later in the show, I'll find the image I want.
[00:35:40.188 --> 00:35:41.569]  We're gonna just probably leave it up the entire show.
[00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:42.850]  I think I'll just leave the image up.
[00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:44.271]  I have to go to rebroadcast.
[00:35:44.291 --> 00:35:45.431]  I have to get the image.
[00:35:45.891 --> 00:35:46.352]  I'm not mad.
[00:35:46.372 --> 00:35:47.292]  I'm just gonna have to have it now.
[00:35:47.352 --> 00:35:55.056]  I didn't used to be OCD, but at 50, I'm so OCD now about the classic fight, fight, fight with them all around him and him up out of them.
[00:35:56.097 --> 00:35:57.838]  And he's like this.
[00:35:57.898 --> 00:35:58.478]  That's the one.
[00:35:58.958 --> 00:36:01.740]  We've kind of got the shot, but we don't have the shot.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:02.360]  Here, I'll find it right now.
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:03.641]  Now, that's it.
[00:36:04.605 --> 00:36:05.707]  That's the shot right there.
[00:36:06.147 --> 00:36:07.909]  That right there is determination.
[00:36:09.932 --> 00:36:10.873]  You see that face?
[00:36:11.014 --> 00:36:12.315]  You know what that face is.
[00:36:12.756 --> 00:36:14.819]  That's the face of people in battle, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:17.522 --> 00:36:18.864]  That's the face of determination.
[00:36:18.884 --> 00:36:21.848]  In fact, I've never gotten a tattoo.
[00:36:24.086 --> 00:36:26.508]  I might get this gigantic across my back.
[00:36:27.128 --> 00:36:29.390]  Because I know these people with tattoos.
[00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:30.030]  I see a lot of cool ones.
[00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.911]  I see a lot of horrible ones.
[00:36:31.572 --> 00:36:33.273]  If I was in the military, I'd probably have some.
[00:36:33.793 --> 00:36:36.635]  But, you know, usually it was like you're a sailor, you're a marine, so you've got one.
[00:36:36.655 --> 00:36:37.836]  It's kind of become such a fad.
[00:36:37.876 --> 00:36:39.737]  I was kind of like, yeah, I don't think I'll get one.
[00:36:40.538 --> 00:36:41.278]  But I don't know.
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:47.042]  When they bury me six feet under, I think I might want that on my back.
[00:36:48.844 --> 00:36:50.645]  I bet people are already getting it everywhere.
[00:36:51.806 --> 00:36:53.327]  But you can't do that as a little tattoo.
[00:36:54.031 --> 00:36:58.894]  You can't put that on your arm, you can't put that on your chest, you can't put that on your ass, like a tramp stamp.
[00:36:59.294 --> 00:37:03.196]  If you're gonna do it, it's gotta be like a prison tattoo, all the way across the shoulders.
[00:37:05.177 --> 00:37:06.718]  You know, I'm really thinking about it.
[00:37:08.499 --> 00:37:10.340]  Because you gotta back something like that.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.401]  That is never gonna go away.
[00:37:13.001 --> 00:37:14.322]  That is never gonna be forgotten.
[00:37:15.307 --> 00:37:19.269]  That is over-the-top, powerful, instant, authentic, and real.
[00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:21.611]  And now you know they've released, he did an interview last night.
[00:37:22.011 --> 00:37:26.714]  He's taken the bandage off, and it's just like we saw in the blood, just like I thought, right through the back of the ear.
[00:37:27.094 --> 00:37:37.220]  He has a pierced ear with a 5-5-6 round, and you can see that they sewed it back together, but he's still got a hole right in the back of his ear.
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:43.003]  Truth is so much stranger than fiction.
[00:37:44.059 --> 00:37:52.785]  All right, when we start the next hour, in about 20 minutes, I'm going to go directly to Spaces speakers and callers.
[00:37:52.985 --> 00:37:54.226]  So I guess I should give the toll-free number.
[00:37:54.266 --> 00:37:54.967]  We're going to do both.
[00:37:56.368 --> 00:37:58.329]  But let's only get about seven or eight callers.
[00:37:58.349 --> 00:38:00.270]  We have a phone system that takes 20-plus calls.
[00:38:00.831 --> 00:38:01.671]  I'll never get to 20 calls.
[00:38:02.292 --> 00:38:05.114]  I'm taking X Spaces speakers as well.
[00:38:05.914 --> 00:38:08.816]  So rack up eight calls.
[00:38:10.077 --> 00:38:12.139]  The time we have, I'll get to those.
[00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:16.550]  Eleven days later, what do you think of the attempted Trump assassination?
[00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:17.451]  What are they going to do next?
[00:38:17.871 --> 00:38:24.955]  Kamala Harris, in all of her idiocy, Biden, you know, set to officially step down, but he actually was finally seen it for six days.
[00:38:25.356 --> 00:38:27.217]  They said, what, are you going to step down?
[00:38:27.337 --> 00:38:28.117]  Or why'd you step down?
[00:38:28.137 --> 00:38:29.438]  And he said, started laughing.
[00:38:30.999 --> 00:38:34.961]  So the evidence is overwhelming now that they just put out a letter, a staff did, that he'd resigned.
[00:38:36.485 --> 00:38:38.827]  With no evidence and then basically put pressure on him to do it.
[00:38:39.147 --> 00:38:51.076]  And finally once he got it through his head that it was over, as they basically held him captive it looks like, well they admit he was throwing fits in Delaware and then he's released but still won't talk about it and just laughs about it.
[00:38:52.557 --> 00:38:54.098]  That's how arrogant this guy is.
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.221]  So we've got that.
[00:38:57.281 --> 00:38:59.703]  So the toll free number to join us, we'll open the phones up right now.
[00:39:00.725 --> 00:39:00.765]  877-789-2539.
[00:39:00.785 --> 00:39:00.965]  877-789-Alex.
[00:39:00.985 --> 00:39:01.145]  877-789-2539.
[00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:12.585]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[00:39:12.585 --> 00:39:18.364]   And at Real Alex Jones on the spaces, you're an ex-user, you just go there, click on the
[00:39:18.364 --> 00:39:20.305]  top of my Real Alex Jones, my picture.
[00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:22.071]  You'll see a purple circle around it.
[00:39:22.091 --> 00:39:22.731]  That means we're live.
[00:39:23.311 --> 00:39:24.871]  You click that and you'll get into the spaces.
[00:39:25.291 --> 00:39:29.192]  You can also watch the show there on X at Real Alex Jones as well.
[00:39:29.592 --> 00:39:31.192]  Spaces doesn't have a video element yet.
[00:39:32.493 --> 00:39:34.853]  I'm told they're very, very, very, very, very close to it.
[00:39:35.233 --> 00:39:39.094]  New Trump assassination details emerging now with Alex Jones and speakers.
[00:39:39.774 --> 00:39:42.234]  So that just got launched minutes ago.
[00:39:43.394 --> 00:39:44.235]  All right, let's stop there.
[00:39:45.215 --> 00:39:46.395]  I mentioned Jim Acosta.
[00:39:48.433 --> 00:39:53.676]  So let's go ahead and, again, I could do three hours on this one clip.
[00:39:55.137 --> 00:40:04.283]  Acosta literally crawls out from under his rock, the little harasser of Trump, he's like a horsefly, just flies around, biting you.
[00:40:05.064 --> 00:40:12.928]  And then here he comes back out like an eel from the rocks and says, how ridiculous is it that Trump's blamed the Secret Service?
[00:40:12.969 --> 00:40:14.109]  I mean, she resigned.
[00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:15.010]  What does that mean?
[00:40:16.701 --> 00:40:25.292]  Obviously the Secret Service did a terrible, horrible, negligent job, bare minimum, and all the evidences they were at the leadership level in on it, and this was an attempted CIA operation.
[00:40:25.792 --> 00:40:30.538]  Got all these top Navy SEALs and Delta Force members of Congress and people saying the same thing I've said.
[00:40:30.778 --> 00:40:32.641]  The default safety was turned off.
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.743]  You've got a guy parading around the roof for 26 minutes.
[00:40:36.484 --> 00:40:39.729]  You've got multiple videos of a guy with a gun laying on the roof in pants.
[00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:44.857]  And then you've got the body cam footage of the guy in shorts, bloody and dead.
[00:40:44.877 --> 00:40:46.599]  It doesn't even look like him.
[00:40:46.679 --> 00:40:47.661]  I mean, this is getting weird.
[00:40:48.971 --> 00:40:56.717]  But they thought they'd have Trump dead, then they were going to detonate truck bombs or things like that to then change the subject, and we would be in martial law right now.
[00:40:56.877 --> 00:40:58.478]  And they were already ready to take out Biden.
[00:40:58.839 --> 00:40:59.919]  Now you've seen them do that.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.961]  And they're coronating like she's a queen.
[00:41:01.981 --> 00:41:05.484]  Kamala Harris, outside of law, no one voted for her in the primary.
[00:41:06.124 --> 00:41:11.428]  She had 2% when she ran for vice president of the polls.
[00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:12.649]  She was super unpopular.
[00:41:12.669 --> 00:41:14.691]  I mean, the woman is a joke.
[00:41:17.742 --> 00:41:19.704]  Kamala Harris is as black as I am.
[00:41:22.708 --> 00:41:24.230]  I don't, I've had my DNA done.
[00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:25.671]  I don't, I don't have any African blood.
[00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:26.392]  I'd be proud if I did.
[00:41:26.813 --> 00:41:27.894]  I got Native American.
[00:41:29.295 --> 00:41:30.277]  My dad's like 13%.
[00:41:32.079 --> 00:41:36.484]  So I'm basically 6 point whatever.
[00:41:38.902 --> 00:41:40.182]  But I'm not Native American.
[00:41:40.222 --> 00:41:43.144]  I mean, Pocahontas, the Senator, Elizabeth Warren has none of it in her.
[00:41:43.184 --> 00:41:44.444]  She said she was.
[00:41:45.124 --> 00:41:48.386]  But I'm like 6 point whatever percent, no African.
[00:41:49.186 --> 00:41:49.566]  Zero.
[00:41:51.147 --> 00:41:57.269]  This woman, maybe her dad had 6% African.
[00:41:58.149 --> 00:42:00.450]  I mean, you take a look at him, I'd love to see her DNA test.
[00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:02.871]  In fact, people, because she's running on that she's black.
[00:42:04.383 --> 00:42:06.484]  And you know they said if you don't vote for Biden you ain't black.
[00:42:06.805 --> 00:42:08.726]  I'm surprised Biden didn't say he was black.
[00:42:10.127 --> 00:42:14.670]  Joe Biden is a joke and we know it.
[00:42:16.691 --> 00:42:21.174]  We got Dr. Stella Emanuel who grew up in Africa and is a great doctor and super smart and also a great pastor.
[00:42:21.494 --> 00:42:23.115]  You can look at her, she's a beautiful lady.
[00:42:23.235 --> 00:42:24.336]  She's 100% African.
[00:42:24.576 --> 00:42:25.317]  She's a black lady.
[00:42:25.757 --> 00:42:26.858]  I'm gonna ask her what she's in here.
[00:42:26.898 --> 00:42:27.818]  Is Kamala Harris black?
[00:42:29.479 --> 00:42:29.779]  Stella?
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:31.300]  Dr. Stella, is she black?
[00:42:32.659 --> 00:42:33.620]  That's a black woman.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:42.945]  This woman is not even a... What was the term my black buddies used growing up in Dallas about black girls that were part white?
[00:42:43.446 --> 00:42:44.186]  Yellow bone?
[00:42:45.507 --> 00:42:46.107]  Stuff like that.
[00:42:46.127 --> 00:42:47.128]  What was the other names?
[00:42:48.329 --> 00:42:48.989]  Had a lot of names.
[00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:55.073]  But the point is, is that Kamala Harris is not even a yellow bone.
[00:42:58.325 --> 00:43:03.509]  Kamala Harris, maximum, maximum is 6% black.
[00:43:04.891 --> 00:43:06.372]  And it's ridiculous.
[00:43:06.432 --> 00:43:09.454]  And like, they could have found a smart black lady to be the president.
[00:43:10.135 --> 00:43:11.196]  But they don't want that.
[00:43:11.256 --> 00:43:19.883]  They want a super dumb person, ladies and gentlemen, who they control, just like Joe Biden.
[00:43:21.164 --> 00:43:22.645]  They want an idiotic puppet.
[00:43:23.646 --> 00:43:24.907]  And they come in all shapes and sizes.
[00:43:26.957 --> 00:43:28.878]  I mean, Kamala Harris is basically Indian.
[00:43:30.738 --> 00:43:42.722]  And nothing against Indians, but my God, she's the first Indian Vice President, she's the first black Vice President, she's at least half white, and then why are you never white?
[00:43:43.182 --> 00:43:46.063]  I don't look at something and say, oh, what color are they?
[00:43:46.103 --> 00:43:47.483]  I look at, like, what do they stand for?
[00:43:47.543 --> 00:43:48.023]  What do they do?
[00:43:48.063 --> 00:43:48.543]  Who are they?
[00:43:50.344 --> 00:43:51.224]  But I'm digressing.
[00:43:51.224 --> 00:43:57.724]  We need to get to all these clips.
[00:43:58.622 --> 00:43:59.442]  Here's Jim Acosta.
[00:43:59.282 --> 00:44:23.001]  This guy is so hard to listen to but here it is.
[00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:27.114]  Let me go back to Jonathan Wackrow, who's still with us, I believe.
[00:44:27.494 --> 00:44:35.340]  Jonathan, when you hear the former president saying something like that, what's your reaction?
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:41.264]  I mean, obviously the Secret Service is a professional operation.
[00:44:41.284 --> 00:44:47.169]  To say something like they did not protect me, it just sounds just wildly irresponsible.
[00:44:49.284 --> 00:44:57.585]  Yeah, I mean, he's just capitalizing on the moment and, you know, it's, uh, he's looking at this through the color of politics, not the reality of the situation.
[00:44:58.766 --> 00:44:59.846]  Not the reality.
[00:45:00.186 --> 00:45:01.526]  26 minutes, he's on the roof.
[00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:03.466]  The advance team didn't put him on the roof.
[00:45:04.127 --> 00:45:10.768]  The higher building has the Secret Service Command Center looking out 50 feet away from where the guy took the shots.
[00:45:11.048 --> 00:45:14.348]  Everybody's running away and pointing, man with a gun, man with a gun, for minutes and minutes.
[00:45:15.388 --> 00:45:18.229]  We have this new body cam footage that already confirms what we already knew.
[00:45:19.386 --> 00:45:36.851]  It's coming up that Senator Grassley released, and then he gets up there and says it's horrible, it's preposterous, it's irresponsible to then say that the Secret Service didn't do their job.
[00:45:38.852 --> 00:45:40.612]  That is wild, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:41.913 --> 00:45:45.994]  Alright, I got like 20 of these, but I gotta start getting some of them to get them on record.
[00:45:48.413 --> 00:45:51.356]  Let's go to some clips of Kamala Harris.
[00:45:52.377 --> 00:45:59.003]  And again, they should go after her on her record as Attorney General in California, and before that the DA in San Francisco.
[00:46:00.825 --> 00:46:02.867]  She threw the book at black people.
[00:46:03.647 --> 00:46:04.889]  I've seen the videos.
[00:46:05.069 --> 00:46:06.570]  We should do ads with those.
[00:46:07.251 --> 00:46:14.306]   Pull up those and show her 20 years ago going, If we catch you with marijuana, you're getting five years in prison.
[00:46:14.587 --> 00:46:16.448]  If we catch you with crack cocaine, 20 years.
[00:46:16.889 --> 00:46:22.234]  I'm gonna throw the book, and her specialty was putting black people in jail and calling them predators, just like Biden.
[00:46:23.395 --> 00:46:24.996]  She wouldn't call herself black-backed in.
[00:46:26.057 --> 00:46:33.864]  And then she's the one that put the pro-lifers that caught abortion clinics illegally selling baby parts in prison.
[00:46:35.506 --> 00:46:37.905]  So she is a police state lover.
[00:46:37.905 --> 00:46:46.706]   Dave in the New York Times said Kamala Harris was not a progressive prosecutor.
[00:46:46.869 --> 00:46:48.870]  But now she just has released criminals out of jail.
[00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:51.531]  Hell, you're shooting people, you're burning things down, release them.
[00:46:51.891 --> 00:46:54.832]  That's the new Kamala, because she'll do whatever she's told.
[00:46:55.773 --> 00:46:57.874]  I've got over 20 clips of her, but let's just get to a few of them here.
[00:46:58.607 --> 00:47:02.449]  This is her giggling and cackling when they talk about locking Trump up and she's the prosecutor.
[00:47:02.469 --> 00:47:03.209]  She'll get him.
[00:47:03.869 --> 00:47:05.450]  Totally drunk Kamala Harris.
[00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:10.432]  Kamala Harris was in Australia saying we should follow their gun confiscation plans.
[00:47:10.792 --> 00:47:14.233]  Kamala says she supports 70 to 80 percent tax rates.
[00:47:14.253 --> 00:47:16.534]  She wants to basically restrict beef and make you eat bugs.
[00:47:17.934 --> 00:47:20.295]  This is just... Play clip 16 through 19.
[00:47:20.335 --> 00:47:22.496]  Lock him up!
[00:47:25.597 --> 00:47:26.958]  Lock him up!
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:38.523]  Because when we think about the strength of our democracy, you know, I think that there's a duality to the nature of democracy.
[00:47:39.744 --> 00:47:51.509]  When it's intact, oh, it's so strong in terms of what it does to uphold and protect individual rights and freedoms.
[00:47:51.969 --> 00:47:53.850]  So strong in its nature.
[00:47:55.311 --> 00:47:57.812]  And it's very fragile.
[00:48:00.726 --> 00:48:03.607]  It will only be as strong as our willingness to fight for it.
[00:48:04.107 --> 00:48:12.989]  Gun violence has terrorized and traumatized so many of our communities in this country.
[00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:22.172]  And let us be clear, it does not have to be this way, as our friends in Australia have demonstrated.
[00:48:22.898 --> 00:48:25.340]  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the new darling of the party.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.722]  She officially has more Twitter followers than Nancy Pelosi.
[00:48:28.043 --> 00:48:31.106]  She was on 60 Minutes this weekend proudly calling herself a radical.
[00:48:31.566 --> 00:48:37.872]  And she's promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, every car, should be eliminated within the next 11 years.
[00:48:37.972 --> 00:48:40.354]  Everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax rate.
[00:48:40.834 --> 00:48:45.439]  Do you agree that she could possibly, in this ideology of the socialist left, could splinter your party?
[00:48:46.167 --> 00:48:46.447]  No.
[00:48:46.807 --> 00:48:52.030]  You know, I think that she is challenging the status quo.
[00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:53.450]  I think that's fantastic.
[00:48:54.531 --> 00:49:01.554]  I think that, you know, I used to teach before, especially before, in the last few years.
[00:49:02.134 --> 00:49:08.557]  And the thing that I always loved about teaching was when you teach, it requires you to defend the premise.
[00:49:09.817 --> 00:49:14.780]  And it requires you to re-examine the premise and question, is it still relevant?
[00:49:15.763 --> 00:49:18.085]  Is it, does it have impact?
[00:49:18.105 --> 00:49:19.466]  Does it have meaning?
[00:49:20.126 --> 00:49:25.751]  And I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed.
[00:49:26.791 --> 00:49:29.934]  Buses go here, buses go there, that's what buses do.
[00:49:29.994 --> 00:49:30.954]  That's an actual quote.
[00:49:32.055 --> 00:49:34.597]  Here she is saying she wants to restrict your meat consumption.
[00:49:34.977 --> 00:49:37.279]  Whatever the New World Order wants, she's going to put it out.
[00:49:37.319 --> 00:49:38.720]  She's a perfect puppet.
[00:49:39.921 --> 00:49:44.564]  And then we'll get her talking about, she supports illegal immigrants getting Medicare.
[00:49:44.725 --> 00:49:45.045]  Here it is.
[00:49:45.815 --> 00:49:54.678]  Certain countries have changed their dietary guidelines to reduce the consumption of red meat in light of the impact of the climate change.
[00:49:55.559 --> 00:50:01.661]  If elected, will you be supporting change in dietary guidelines?
[00:50:02.241 --> 00:50:07.823]  And then how will you plan on implementing the changes so that people effectively change their diets?
[00:50:08.666 --> 00:50:11.949]  Yeah, I mean, and thank you, Carol, for your work and the question.
[00:50:12.149 --> 00:50:40.270]   I think of the point that you're raising in a broader context, which is that as a nation, we actually have to have a real priority at the highest level of government around What we eat and in terms of healthy eating because we have a problem in America And we can talk about all that we are now the subject of this conversation we can talk about The amount of sugar in everything we can talk we could talk about soda.
[00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:45.565]   We could go on and on so the answer is yes But I'll also say this.
[00:50:46.786 --> 00:50:55.535]  The balance that we have to strike here, frankly, is about what government can and should do around creating incentives and then banning certain behaviors.
[00:50:55.595 --> 00:50:59.218]  I mean, just to be very honest with you, I love cheeseburgers from time to time, right?
[00:50:59.318 --> 00:51:00.759]  I mean, I just do.
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:15.889]  But there has to be also what we do in terms of creating incentives that we will eat in a healthy way, that we will encourage moderation, and that we will be educated about the effect of our eating habits on our environment.
[00:51:16.229 --> 00:51:19.912]  And we have to do a much better job of that, and the government has to do a much better job of that.
[00:51:21.193 --> 00:51:22.874]  So, I mean, I'm just saying, you love cheeseburgers.
[00:51:22.894 --> 00:51:23.434]  I mean, we all do.
[00:51:23.454 --> 00:51:27.537]  I don't know whether you... I mean, you know, from time to time... A cheeseburger will just surveil you and tax you to have it.
[00:51:32.176 --> 00:51:47.548]  The bill also says, quote, every individual who is a resident of the United States is entitled to benefits for health care services under this act.
[00:51:47.948 --> 00:51:51.090]  Not every individual who's a citizen, but every individual who's a resident.
[00:51:51.611 --> 00:51:56.975]  So you support giving universal health care, Medicare for all, to people who are in this country illegally?
[00:51:57.677 --> 00:51:59.418]  Let me just be very clear about this.
[00:52:00.239 --> 00:52:12.167]  I am opposed to any policy that would deny, in our country, any human being from access to public safety, public education, or public health, period.
[00:52:13.228 --> 00:52:15.490]  And that's from the czar of the border.
[00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:22.395]  We have news clips where they call her the czar three years ago, when Biden put her in, or over three years ago, like three years and three months ago.
[00:52:22.835 --> 00:52:26.938]  But now they're in the news, and I have the news articles, no, she was never the border czar, that's another lie!
[00:52:28.499 --> 00:52:28.799]  All right.
[00:52:28.919 --> 00:52:30.240]  Remember, we're on hundreds of radio stations.
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:31.161]  This is why we have breaks.
[00:52:31.221 --> 00:52:32.202]  Remember, old-fashioned media.
[00:52:32.562 --> 00:52:36.045]  When they banned me five years ago, we still stay on air because we have hundreds of radio affiliates.
[00:52:36.365 --> 00:52:36.806]  We love them.
[00:52:36.826 --> 00:52:39.368]  If you're a local listener, be sure to support their sponsors and support them.
[00:52:39.408 --> 00:52:49.736]  We're going to take a break, start the next hour, and go to your spaces, comments, and your phone calls that covered a ton of news and the new information coming out on the attempted assassination of Trump that is bombshell.
[00:52:50.056 --> 00:52:52.518]  Stay with us and follow me on X and Real Alex Jones.
[00:52:54.199 --> 00:52:59.364]  This is a make-it-or-break-it moment, so I need people to connect those synapses in their brain for you to make a decision.
[00:53:00.525 --> 00:53:03.648]  If you don't support InfoWars, we will be shut down.
[00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:06.470]  People say, well, they're constantly trying to shut you down.
[00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:07.251]  How are you still on the air?
[00:53:07.411 --> 00:53:07.692]  God.
[00:53:08.732 --> 00:53:09.793]  But God works through people.
[00:53:11.315 --> 00:53:22.769]   So, we're in a paradox here where the judge says we're open for three more months, If we're able to get a buyer under the law, they won't be able to shut us down.
[00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:23.710]  I'll just work with somebody else.
[00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:25.130]  And that's coming.
[00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:25.850]  That's got to be set up.
[00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:36.213]  But in the meantime, if people believe the news that we're being shut down everywhere, which they tried to do and failed, by that foregone conclusion, we're shut down.
[00:53:36.333 --> 00:53:47.662]   And under the last federal bankruptcy manager who would not reorder product and killed all our advertising, who was positioning us to be shut down and tried to shut us down, We caught him.
[00:53:47.922 --> 00:53:48.963]  The judge caught him and fired him.
[00:53:50.463 --> 00:53:51.943]  We're almost sold out of all the products.
[00:53:52.744 --> 00:53:53.024]  All right?
[00:53:53.804 --> 00:53:56.545]  But we have a lot of great products that are still in stock.
[00:53:57.045 --> 00:53:57.785]  Limited supplies.
[00:53:57.845 --> 00:54:01.086]  So I need you to go to infowarestore.com.
[00:54:01.326 --> 00:54:02.367]  And we just had a donation button.
[00:54:02.387 --> 00:54:03.167]  Maybe we should just do that.
[00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:06.648]  You're fighting for freedom in a key election, battling the globalists.
[00:54:06.688 --> 00:54:07.328]  We need support.
[00:54:08.048 --> 00:54:09.589]  But we want a long-term relationship with you.
[00:54:10.677 --> 00:54:11.599]  We want you to be symbiotic.
[00:54:11.619 --> 00:54:19.138]  We want you to get great products you like and deliver to you quickly and enjoy them and have them empower you and make your life better so you love them and you keep getting them.
[00:54:19.158 --> 00:54:20.100]  We want a relationship.
[00:54:21.016 --> 00:54:26.778]  So, there's the InfoWars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:54:27.518 --> 00:54:34.781]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's saw palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[00:54:34.801 --> 00:54:39.222]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[00:54:39.282 --> 00:54:40.543]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[00:54:41.263 --> 00:54:51.971]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWars MD.

[00:55:19.299 --> 00:55:20.140]  Works really well.

[00:55:21.641 --> 00:55:22.502]  Huge bottle of it.
[00:55:22.602 --> 00:55:23.443]  You know, jam-packed.
[00:55:23.883 --> 00:55:24.444]  It's there.
[00:55:24.964 --> 00:55:25.885]  Joint Relief Max.
[00:55:26.306 --> 00:55:27.326]  Infowars MD.
[00:55:27.707 --> 00:55:28.488]  Prostate support.
[00:55:28.548 --> 00:55:29.208]  Already mentioned that.
[00:55:29.849 --> 00:55:31.130]  This is just the top formula.
[00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:31.971]  Super high quality.
[00:55:32.331 --> 00:55:32.731]  Organic.
[00:55:33.332 --> 00:55:34.193]  Nerve Renew.

[00:55:40.756 --> 00:55:41.416]  About to sell out.
[00:55:41.456 --> 00:55:42.296]  Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:55:42.316 --> 00:55:44.697]  And something I never talk about and should talk about more.
[00:55:44.777 --> 00:55:46.038]  Probiotic Fiber.
[00:55:46.198 --> 00:55:50.180]  A super high-end product at a low price at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:51.220]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:55:53.141 --> 00:55:54.261]  We're now into hour number two.
[00:55:54.281 --> 00:56:00.164]  11 days after the attempted assassination of President Trump and all the evidence is coming out of a deep state coup.
[00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:01.917]  And Larry Pinckney has called in.
[00:56:02.177 --> 00:56:05.779]  Well, I fired the bat signal, and I said, man, we haven't had Larry Pinckney on.
[00:56:05.799 --> 00:56:07.719]  I've been begging him to come on as a guest, but he's been so busy.
[00:56:08.139 --> 00:56:13.661]  He's one of the founding members of the real Black Panther Party, an American patriot, a populist, a pro-human for everybody.
[00:56:13.701 --> 00:56:14.981]  He sees right through the enemy plans.
[00:56:15.522 --> 00:56:19.783]  And I'm so glad we're launching this Space Ensemblecast on X, and he is the first caller.
[00:56:19.843 --> 00:56:20.803]  We're also taking calls.
[00:56:21.163 --> 00:56:22.064]  This is a short segment.
[00:56:22.104 --> 00:56:22.964]  Some stations don't carry it.
[00:56:22.984 --> 00:56:25.025]  We'll hold you over, Larry, because I want you to have some time.
[00:56:25.045 --> 00:56:29.006]  I don't want everybody else with Chase Geyser controlling the space here on X.
[00:56:29.566 --> 00:56:33.168]  But my friend, first off, my brother, what do you make of the assassination attempt?
[00:56:33.648 --> 00:56:35.789]  You were on just a few weeks ago saying they're going to try to kill Trump.
[00:56:36.149 --> 00:56:37.670]  You said it, we should get that clip and play it.
[00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:40.471]  And then what they're doing, Kamala and Biden and all of it.
[00:56:40.891 --> 00:56:43.232]  This is, we only got four minutes to break, but you got the floor, brother.
[00:56:44.513 --> 00:56:45.673]  Well, thank you, my brother.
[00:56:45.693 --> 00:56:47.194]  It is great to hear your voice.
[00:56:47.214 --> 00:56:51.976]  But beyond that, it is great that you are continuing to fight as we all must do.
[00:56:52.376 --> 00:56:57.818]  What I think about the assassination attempt is that they're going to try it again and again and again.
[00:56:59.792 --> 00:57:05.181]   And, you know, President Trump is standing in front of us.
[00:57:05.381 --> 00:57:10.163]  We must stand in front of him, and beside him, and behind him.
[00:57:10.623 --> 00:57:17.005]  We must understand this is about more, more than President Donald J. Trump.
[00:57:17.105 --> 00:57:22.567]  This is about our republic, our entire nation, our republic.
[00:57:22.967 --> 00:57:31.226]   So it is crystal clear, crystal clear that the fact of the matter is, frankly, to be
[00:57:31.226 --> 00:57:41.047]   blunt, that the so-called stand down by the Secret Service was absolutely, beyond being
[00:57:41.047 --> 00:57:52.287]   criminal negligence, it was clearly all about setting up Donald J. Trump to be blown away,
[00:57:52.287 --> 00:57:56.046]  we used to say back in the day in the 60s and 70s.
[00:57:56.496 --> 00:58:02.897]  This was not, you know when people say criminal negligence, well what is criminal negligence?
[00:58:03.517 --> 00:58:04.377]  Think about it.
[00:58:04.777 --> 00:58:09.938]  If it was negligent and it was criminal, then it was deliberate.
[00:58:10.098 --> 00:58:12.058]  I'm sorry, I need to calm down a little bit.
[00:58:12.118 --> 00:58:15.559]  No, no, you should be upset and so am I Larry, because this means the deep state is going for broke.
[00:58:16.656 --> 00:58:17.857]  Yes, yes.
[00:58:18.377 --> 00:58:27.442]  They're going after Donald J. Trump any possible way they can, his family, his supporters, the American people.
[00:58:27.742 --> 00:58:32.544]  We need to clearly understand what we are dealing with.
[00:58:32.844 --> 00:58:39.648]   We are dealing with people who lack, L-A-C-K, lack All boundaries.
[00:58:39.688 --> 00:58:40.788]  They have no boundaries.
[00:58:40.808 --> 00:58:42.149]  I've said this before.
[00:58:42.489 --> 00:58:43.769]  They are not immoral.
[00:58:43.809 --> 00:58:45.110]  They are amoral.
[00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:46.610]  They have no morals.
[00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:53.713]  They lie, steal, cheat, and play us off as best they can against one another.
[00:58:54.013 --> 00:59:01.289]   And as far as that Trojan horse, Kamala Harris, Kamala Harris, whatever.
[00:59:01.749 --> 00:59:06.632]  As far as that creature is concerned, it's here we go again.
[00:59:07.273 --> 00:59:09.154]  Black, you must be kidding.
[00:59:09.494 --> 00:59:12.856]  That's like, and I don't mean you, obviously, I mean them.
[00:59:13.236 --> 00:59:18.780]  Them, the deep state, the Democrats, the neoliberal fascists that they are.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:20.401]  They must be kidding.
[00:59:20.421 --> 00:59:23.143]  How stupid do they think we are?
[00:59:23.643 --> 00:59:24.864]  We're not stupid.
[00:59:25.284 --> 00:59:26.705]  We know what they're about.
[00:59:27.345 --> 00:59:33.350]  We know what they intend to do, and we must not allow it to happen.
[00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:48.701]  I'm calling upon everybody, all patriots, all of the American patriots, of the people all over this great republic, with all its faults and flaws, it is still a great republic.
[00:59:49.282 --> 00:59:51.944]  I'm calling upon the people to unite.
[00:59:52.515 --> 00:59:53.676]  To stay united.
[00:59:53.976 --> 00:59:55.957]  Do not be divided.
[00:59:56.358 --> 00:59:57.659]  Do not let them do this.
[00:59:58.079 --> 00:59:59.980]  And stop going for the ghost!
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.342]  And what do I mean by going for the ghost?
[01:00:02.742 --> 01:00:04.984]  I mean, stop being sucker punched!
[01:00:05.484 --> 01:00:07.025]  Stop being bamboozled!
[01:00:07.085 --> 01:00:08.466]  Stop being hoodwinked!
[01:00:09.221 --> 01:00:10.261]  Kamala Harris.
[01:00:10.621 --> 01:00:13.582]  What a thick, dangerous joke!
[01:00:14.262 --> 01:00:19.904]  And we must understand that these are the kinds of tactics that they will continue to use.
[01:00:20.324 --> 01:00:20.984]  The media.
[01:00:21.164 --> 01:00:22.545]  We don't have a media.
[01:00:22.725 --> 01:00:27.966]  We have a propaganda machine that would make Goebbels green with envy.
[01:00:28.247 --> 01:00:30.027]  We don't have a media.
[01:00:30.287 --> 01:00:31.407]  Stanley, you're on fire.
[01:00:31.567 --> 01:00:32.328]  Larry Pinkney.
[01:00:32.848 --> 01:00:34.548]  We need Larry to do a show for us.
[01:00:34.608 --> 01:00:36.449]  He should be on the next show we add.
[01:00:36.889 --> 01:00:37.589]  We'll be right back, Larry.
[01:00:37.629 --> 01:00:38.029]  We love you.
[01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.850]  60 seconds, brother.
[01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:40.730]  All right, we're now in hour number two.
[01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:44.471]  I've known Larry Pinckney, it's got to be 18 years or so.
[01:00:44.631 --> 01:00:45.852]  He's been a guest on the show.
[01:00:46.432 --> 01:00:55.074]  He's an original founder member of the Black Panther Party, a former political prisoner, a best-selling author, and just an amazing individual.
[01:00:55.134 --> 01:00:55.674]  So smart.
[01:00:55.774 --> 01:00:56.875]  And I was just sitting there listening to him.
[01:00:56.895 --> 01:00:58.035]  I'm like, this guy's got to have a show.
[01:00:58.514 --> 01:01:03.074]   That's what I planned for this network before they attacked us was to go 24 hours a day.
[01:01:03.074 --> 01:01:05.914]   But maybe an hour a day he does or something, or we get him down here.
[01:01:05.914 --> 01:01:09.315]   I know he takes care of family and other things, but Larry, if you just joined as listeners,
[01:01:09.315 --> 01:01:13.795]   he's got a lot of radio stations, only carry the second and third hour.
[01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:16.733]  Called in, or I said, "Please call Larry and get him on,"
[01:01:16.733 --> 01:01:18.393]  and he was already listening.
[01:01:18.393 --> 01:01:22.713]   So I'm trying to get him on as an actual guest, but he's here.
[01:01:22.713 --> 01:01:24.835]  And a lot of stations didn't carry the last five.
[01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:27.621]  So recap what you said, because it's better than what I could say.
[01:01:27.641 --> 01:01:28.282]  It's so true.
[01:01:29.002 --> 01:01:29.462]  We've got it.
[01:01:29.682 --> 01:01:30.842]  Trump is out in front of us.
[01:01:31.162 --> 01:01:32.923]  As he said, they're trying to get through him to get to us.
[01:01:33.243 --> 01:01:43.245]  He just wants basic populist policies that actually help the people, that actually give jobs to people, that make energy cheap, food cheap, housing cheap, by turning on the market we've got.
[01:01:43.265 --> 01:01:45.106]  The globalists are standing in the way of that.
[01:01:45.166 --> 01:01:46.686]  They've done everything to him.
[01:01:47.086 --> 01:01:48.626]  Maybe you can go through what they've done to him, Larry.
[01:01:48.646 --> 01:01:49.807]  And it was obvious trajectory.
[01:01:49.827 --> 01:01:50.727]  You were on two weeks ago.
[01:01:51.227 --> 01:01:51.948]  We've got to re-air that.
[01:01:51.968 --> 01:01:53.491]  I remember you said they're going to try to kill him.
[01:01:53.671 --> 01:01:54.372]  We said that on air.
[01:01:54.792 --> 01:01:56.114]  And that false flags were the next thing.
[01:01:56.936 --> 01:02:00.781]  Well, Larry's been involved in this for hell, 60 years, folks.
[01:02:00.801 --> 01:02:01.542]  I've been involved 30.
[01:02:02.223 --> 01:02:03.245]  He knows what he's talking about.
[01:02:03.285 --> 01:02:04.286]  He's got a lot of wisdom.
[01:02:05.015 --> 01:02:08.799]  And he's been through hell and he watched how they infiltrate groups and set them up and put them in prison.
[01:02:09.279 --> 01:02:11.922]  Same thing they're doing to me and Trump and everybody around us.
[01:02:12.483 --> 01:02:13.744]  And so this is a war.
[01:02:13.764 --> 01:02:15.686]  And people say, well I don't want to fight it, they're going to get me.
[01:02:15.926 --> 01:02:17.668]  They're going to get everybody if we don't stand up.
[01:02:18.409 --> 01:02:18.709]  Okay?
[01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:22.753]  And so Larry, recap from your historical understanding what's been done to Trump.
[01:02:23.153 --> 01:02:25.135]  Repeat what you said because he's out in front of us.
[01:02:25.876 --> 01:02:27.176]  Just like the Secret Service should have done.
[01:02:27.216 --> 01:02:29.757]  We've got to be in front of him, beside him, behind him.
[01:02:30.377 --> 01:02:31.718]  We've got to shield him.
[01:02:31.738 --> 01:02:32.638]  He's so real.
[01:02:32.658 --> 01:02:33.278]  He's not perfect.
[01:02:33.318 --> 01:02:33.818]  None of us are.
[01:02:34.138 --> 01:02:34.938]  But he's real.
[01:02:35.018 --> 01:02:35.939]  He wants to be the president.
[01:02:35.959 --> 01:02:36.819]  He was the president.
[01:02:37.239 --> 01:02:38.439]  And that's why they hate him.
[01:02:38.979 --> 01:02:42.540]  And now we have Kamala being crowned as the new person with no votes.
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:45.861]  It illustrates the dictatorial, totalitarian nature of the globalization.
[01:02:47.562 --> 01:02:52.243]  I can tell you, they are going to go absolutely for broke here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:54.011 --> 01:02:55.812]  I just lost audio in my earpiece.
[01:02:56.613 --> 01:02:56.953]  It's back.
[01:02:56.973 --> 01:02:58.414]  We had a sound system problem.
[01:02:58.434 --> 01:02:59.695]  That rarely happens, but it just happened.
[01:02:59.715 --> 01:03:00.056]  We're back.
[01:03:00.096 --> 01:03:01.735]  We're all good engineers?
[01:03:01.735 --> 01:03:03.076]  We're good?
[01:03:03.076 --> 01:03:05.576]  Good, good, 'cause I heard audio go out for a minute.
[01:03:05.179 --> 01:03:07.021]  So Larry, epic what you were saying.
[01:03:07.041 --> 01:03:08.542]  A lot of stations weren't carrying it.
[01:03:08.602 --> 01:03:12.465]  Repeat what you said and then extrapolate into what's coming next because we're so honored to have you.
[01:03:13.706 --> 01:03:21.608]  Well, first and foremost, I'm honored to be a part of this patriotic and very necessary fight, my brother.
[01:03:22.128 --> 01:03:23.188]  I really, really am.
[01:03:23.428 --> 01:03:26.029]  We're all in this together, or not at all.
[01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:29.550]  We're in this struggle for our republic together.
[01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:39.485]   Now, what I said earlier, one, the actions, or should I say inactions, by the so-called Secret Service Obviously!
[01:03:40.186 --> 01:03:40.967]  Obviously!
[01:03:41.187 --> 01:03:52.319]  We don't have to be rocket scientists to know that this was clearly an attempt to have Donald J. Trump assassinated.
[01:03:52.679 --> 01:03:55.162]  We don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that.
[01:03:55.482 --> 01:03:58.386]  The American people, we're not stupid.
[01:03:59.128 --> 01:04:05.772]  And I'm sick and tired of us being treated as if we are by the media, the propaganda machine.
[01:04:06.272 --> 01:04:17.299]  What I said earlier, and I'll say it again, is Donald J. Trump is standing out in front, but we must be in front of him, beside him, and behind him.
[01:04:17.659 --> 01:04:24.383]  We must surround him, his family, all of those who are working with him.
[01:04:24.423 --> 01:04:30.022]   We must surround him with love, With strength!
[01:04:30.882 --> 01:04:33.444]  And we must be his eyes and his ears.
[01:04:34.165 --> 01:04:34.845]  We must!
[01:04:35.105 --> 01:04:37.407]  No pun intended when I said ears.
[01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:39.429]  I meant what I said.
[01:04:40.089 --> 01:04:49.857]  The bottom line for all of us is if we do not stand up, and I'm talking about non-violently, so somebody can't come along and distort it.
[01:04:50.177 --> 01:04:54.280]  Oh, Pinky's calling for- I'm calling for us to be patriots.
[01:04:55.114 --> 01:04:55.494]  All right?
[01:04:55.794 --> 01:05:00.916]  I'm calling for us to understand that we are in perilous times.
[01:05:01.516 --> 01:05:04.998]  Our republic is at the very precipice.
[01:05:05.918 --> 01:05:07.598]  The very precipice.
[01:05:07.638 --> 01:05:14.901]  We're on that, we're at that cliff and we must do everything we can to regain our republic.
[01:05:14.961 --> 01:05:29.421]   Now, as far as Kamala Harris or Kamala Harris or I can think of some other names obviously that alone for now, the bottom line is This woman is essentially the reincarnation of Hillary Clinton.
[01:05:29.461 --> 01:05:30.684]  Come on, let's be real.
[01:05:31.205 --> 01:05:32.027]  That's all she is.
[01:05:32.942 --> 01:05:38.084]  And here they go again, trying to play the, quote, race card, the color card.
[01:05:38.484 --> 01:05:38.924]  Come on!
[01:05:39.544 --> 01:05:40.285]  Do they know?
[01:05:40.385 --> 01:05:44.206]  Do they remember the words of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King?
[01:05:44.266 --> 01:05:45.906]  Do they remember what he said?
[01:05:46.407 --> 01:05:54.409]  The content of one's character instead of, or versus, the color of one's skin?
[01:05:54.429 --> 01:05:56.450]  Have they heard it?
[01:05:57.199 --> 01:06:00.382]  Are these neoliberal fascists out there listening?
[01:06:00.803 --> 01:06:02.204]  Do they understand?
[01:06:02.224 --> 01:06:10.692]  It is time for us, as Brother Malcolm said, to stop being pimped, to stop being used, to stop being bamboozled and hoodwinked.
[01:06:11.152 --> 01:06:19.636]   It is time for us, black, white, brown, red, yellow, alright, American citizens, Come together for God's sake!
[01:06:19.856 --> 01:06:23.056]  come together for our republic.
[01:06:23.056 --> 01:06:27.456]   And you were the founder of the new Black Panther Party and heavily persecuted.
[01:06:27.456 --> 01:06:29.455]  You witnessed them kill Martin Luther King.
[01:06:29.455 --> 01:06:30.656]  Not the new Black Panther Party.
[01:06:30.656 --> 01:06:34.256]  Not the new, the original Black Panther Party.
[01:06:35.146 --> 01:06:36.027]  And you were there.
[01:06:36.107 --> 01:06:38.689]  You saw them kill JFK, RFK.
[01:06:39.070 --> 01:06:41.332]  You saw them kill MLK.
[01:06:41.352 --> 01:06:46.537]  You saw them kill Malcolm X. You were there, and you know the enemy we're facing.
[01:06:46.777 --> 01:06:51.081]  People need to understand, this is the permanent deep state, literally at war with the people.
[01:06:51.101 --> 01:06:57.848]  Can you speak to being such a prominent person in the original Black Panther Party, not the new FBI controlled, unlike the KKK's controlled?
[01:06:59.229 --> 01:07:03.574]  In the real, original Black Panther Party about your historical understanding of what we're facing right now.
[01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:06.611]  Well, I saw, alright?
[01:07:07.071 --> 01:07:08.091]  I remember.
[01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:09.611]  This is from memory.
[01:07:09.631 --> 01:07:14.873]  I was very much alive when they assassinated, when they murdered JFK.
[01:07:15.153 --> 01:07:19.755]  I was very much alive when they murdered Medgar Evers.
[01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:26.637]  I was very much alive when they murdered Malcolm X. I was very much alive when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:07:26.917 --> 01:07:32.778]  I was very much alive, in fact, just a few blocks away the day they murdered Robert Kennedy.
[01:07:33.259 --> 01:07:40.732]   I understand Just how insidious these people are, if you can call them people.
[01:07:41.512 --> 01:07:43.133]  I understand, I've seen it.
[01:07:43.613 --> 01:07:48.655]  I saw with my own eyes how they play us off against each other.
[01:07:49.056 --> 01:07:55.119]  They used the color card, the gender card, they used it then, they're using it even more now.
[01:07:55.739 --> 01:08:06.106]   We have got to put our silly Dangerous little differences aside, and come together for the benefit of our entire Republic.
[01:08:06.526 --> 01:08:07.146]  I saw it.
[01:08:07.527 --> 01:08:08.487]  I feel pain.
[01:08:08.547 --> 01:08:12.750]  I think of the people that I knew who gave their lives.
[01:08:13.291 --> 01:08:15.292]  Who gave their lives.
[01:08:15.833 --> 01:08:20.616]  We thought the feds, the FBI in particular, and the CIA were bad then.
[01:08:20.976 --> 01:08:21.937]  Oh my God.
[01:08:22.338 --> 01:08:27.081]  Then, that was the late 60s, early 70s, the early 60s as well.
[01:08:27.481 --> 01:08:30.103]   But now, Oh my God!
[01:08:30.463 --> 01:08:40.146]  The deep state has literally, literally come out in the open, and it is time for us to acknowledge that.
[01:08:40.406 --> 01:08:41.626]  Yes, we can stop it.
[01:08:41.946 --> 01:08:43.687]  Yes, we can turn it around.
[01:08:44.027 --> 01:08:46.447]  But only if we acknowledge it.
[01:08:46.527 --> 01:08:56.870]  If a person is sick, the person has to acknowledge that he or she is sick, and then they deal with that sickness to eliminate it.
[01:08:57.330 --> 01:09:00.272]  This is what we, as a people, united.
[01:09:00.312 --> 01:09:01.893]  Black, white, brown, red, yellow.
[01:09:04.295 --> 01:09:05.435]  Incredible, Larry.
[01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:08.057]  And repeating what you said from Stacey and Gary in the first five.
[01:09:08.497 --> 01:09:10.879]  You said they're going to try to do it again and again and again.
[01:09:10.899 --> 01:09:12.740]  And Trump is tough.
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:13.100]  We get it.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.161]  But he made a smart move.
[01:09:14.221 --> 01:09:16.583]  No more big open rallies outside.
[01:09:16.623 --> 01:09:17.623]  They're going to go at him.
[01:09:17.643 --> 01:09:22.646]  And we're going to let you go because I know you're busy and we've got a bunch of callers and people.
[01:09:22.666 --> 01:09:24.768]  But let me ask you, why don't you come on as a guest soon for hours.
[01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:27.851]  I say first and foremost, I give them my love and my strength.
[01:09:27.871 --> 01:09:29.192]  That's first and foremost.
[01:09:29.012 --> 01:09:35.612]   if they'd have killed Trump and shot him right in the head like Kennedy on that fateful day
[01:09:35.612 --> 01:09:36.612]  eleven days ago.
[01:09:36.612 --> 01:09:37.611]  What would have happened then?
[01:09:37.611 --> 01:09:38.972]  And what is your advice to President Trump?
[01:09:38.972 --> 01:09:41.652]  Because I can tell you, his top people watch the show daily.
[01:09:41.652 --> 01:09:44.092]  We're on, in Trump headquarters right now.
[01:09:44.092 --> 01:09:45.092]  They're all listening right now.
[01:09:45.092 --> 01:09:46.092]  What do you say to them?
[01:09:46.092 --> 01:09:50.891]   I say first and foremost, I give them my love and my strength.
[01:09:50.891 --> 01:09:52.531]  That's first and foremost.
[01:09:52.531 --> 01:09:56.172]  Secondly, I say beware.
[01:09:56.172 --> 01:09:57.412]  Be vigilant.
[01:09:57.873 --> 01:10:00.334]  They want to kill us all.
[01:10:00.434 --> 01:10:01.814]  And I'm not exaggerating.
[01:10:01.914 --> 01:10:02.835]  I wish I were.
[01:10:03.495 --> 01:10:13.499]  I'm saying that the decision that President Trump made regarding rallies is a very wise decision.
[01:10:13.879 --> 01:10:15.480]  Be wise, my president.
[01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:17.561]  Be wise, my liege.
[01:10:18.241 --> 01:10:19.122]  Be wise.
[01:10:19.742 --> 01:10:20.402]  Continue.
[01:10:20.422 --> 01:10:21.523]  Stay the course.
[01:10:23.061 --> 01:10:23.742]  They will.
[01:10:23.882 --> 01:10:34.129]  They, the Deep State, the Democrats, these neoliberal fascists, these Rhino Republicans as well, they will try again and again.
[01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:41.915]  And we must remember that and be prepared to do our best to stop this from happening.
[01:10:42.215 --> 01:10:45.337]  To bring America back to what it could be.
[01:10:45.398 --> 01:10:48.720]  The ideals of what America is about.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.361]  Nobody's saying we're perfect.
[01:10:50.761 --> 01:10:51.062]  Never.
[01:10:51.747 --> 01:10:53.168]  But what country is?
[01:10:53.709 --> 01:10:55.890]  They hate Trump because the people love Trump.
[01:10:56.831 --> 01:10:57.371]  Let's be blunt.
[01:10:57.391 --> 01:11:03.296]  They hate Trump because they know that he reaches the hearts, I said hearts, and the minds of the people.
[01:11:03.376 --> 01:11:10.655]   love Trump. Let's be blunt. They hate Trump because they know that he reaches the hearts,
[01:11:10.655 --> 01:11:17.215]   I said hearts and the minds of the people. They hate Trump because he is a populist,
[01:11:17.215 --> 01:11:20.735]  because the people love him.
[01:11:20.895 --> 01:11:23.297]  Therefore, they hate him.
[01:11:23.757 --> 01:11:25.779]  Therefore, we must love him.
[01:11:26.119 --> 01:11:35.806]  As Malcolm said, the bottom line is that if we don't watch out, the media will have you loving the people who hate you and hating the people who love you.
[01:11:35.826 --> 01:11:39.028]   President Trump Much love to you, my liege.
[01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:40.428]  Stay strong.
[01:11:40.688 --> 01:11:41.509]  Stay the course.
[01:11:41.749 --> 01:11:42.529]  Absolutely.
[01:11:42.729 --> 01:11:52.313]  And to you, Alex, much love to you and all the wonderful crew of InfoWars, and wow, the listeners of InfoWars.
[01:11:52.693 --> 01:11:56.515]  I say, as we said back in the day, all power to the people.
[01:11:56.615 --> 01:11:58.276]  Black, white, brown, red, yellow.
[01:11:58.736 --> 01:12:00.417]  And I appreciate this opportunity.
[01:12:00.537 --> 01:12:00.997]  Absolutely.
[01:12:01.097 --> 01:12:03.258]  In closing, you mentioned the Republican establishment.
[01:12:03.738 --> 01:12:05.359]  They're just as bad, but we're taking that over.
[01:12:05.379 --> 01:12:06.079]  That's why they're scared.
[01:12:06.659 --> 01:12:12.587]  There's multiple videos and photos of Rupert Murdoch and Lindsey Graham who are deep state as you get.
[01:12:13.047 --> 01:12:16.031]  They were so upset during Trump's speech.
[01:12:16.511 --> 01:12:17.973]  And that's the enemy right there.
[01:12:17.993 --> 01:12:18.874]  It's not just the Democrats.
[01:12:18.914 --> 01:12:19.976]  They are so upset right now.
[01:12:20.939 --> 01:12:21.740]  That is correct.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:25.143]  We must watch out for the Trojan Horses.
[01:12:25.744 --> 01:12:26.845]  That's what I call them.
[01:12:27.145 --> 01:12:28.226]  Trojan Horses.
[01:12:28.666 --> 01:12:35.332]  They work with these demons, which means they are part of the demonic plague that we're dealing with.
[01:12:35.673 --> 01:12:38.916]  And I use those terms very deliberately.
[01:12:39.016 --> 01:12:40.117]  I know what I'm saying.
[01:12:40.557 --> 01:12:43.480]  And I know that we can win, brothers and sisters.
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:49.802]   I know that we can win, but we must strong as that biblical passage says,
[01:12:49.802 --> 01:12:52.742]  faith without work is dead.
[01:12:52.742 --> 01:12:57.822]   And we must keep the faith and keep the struggle to regain this
[01:12:57.822 --> 01:12:58.782]  republic.
[01:12:58.782 --> 01:13:01.782]  Larry, how do people find you?
[01:13:01.782 --> 01:13:08.563]   You can find me in an approach at blackactivist,
[01:13:08.563 --> 01:13:12.501]  that's activistwg.org.
[01:13:12.501 --> 01:13:16.202]   WG stands for Writers Guild, Black Activist.
[01:13:16.202 --> 01:13:17.702]  WG.com.
[01:13:17.650 --> 01:13:19.992]  And they called him, he was already listening.
[01:13:20.012 --> 01:13:21.574]  That's a smart guy right there.
[01:13:21.394 --> 01:13:24.474]   some great videos. Yes. Please do more. We love you. Larry Pinkney. Thank you.
[01:13:24.474 --> 01:13:29.233]  Please stay strong, my brother. Love you. Bye bye. Amazing.
[01:13:29.233 --> 01:13:31.233]  I'm so glad he was able to get through.
[01:13:31.233 --> 01:13:34.394]   We got him on as I want him on and they called him. He was already listening.
[01:13:34.394 --> 01:13:36.873]  That's a smart guy right there. And then the real deal.
[01:13:36.873 --> 01:13:39.793]  Turn his mic on guys.
[01:13:40.304 --> 01:13:41.124]  I don't hear his mic.
[01:13:42.064 --> 01:13:48.707]  I was just amazed to hear him use the line, they have a propaganda machine that would make Goebbels green with envy.
[01:13:48.827 --> 01:13:53.228]  I mean, he's poetic and everything that he does, so it's iconic and memorable and really drives it home.
[01:13:53.348 --> 01:13:53.808]  Talented man.
[01:13:54.049 --> 01:13:55.849]  Yeah, why don't we make Larry Pinckney vice president?
[01:13:55.869 --> 01:13:58.250]  See, they don't put the smart black people in charge.
[01:13:58.270 --> 01:13:59.571]  They don't put those smart white people.
[01:13:59.591 --> 01:14:01.231]  They put idiots they control.
[01:14:01.871 --> 01:14:04.192]  So we're not against Kamala because she's black.
[01:14:04.532 --> 01:14:06.113]  We're against her because she's a sellout.
[01:14:07.029 --> 01:14:08.309]  New World Order piece of garbage.
[01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:09.610]  Absolutely.
[01:14:10.690 --> 01:14:12.731]  Gosh, if they had a black Donald Trump, I'd vote for him right now.
[01:14:13.291 --> 01:14:15.212]  Yeah, that'd probably be a good thing.
[01:14:15.252 --> 01:14:16.792]  I wish he was black, to be honest with you.
[01:14:16.812 --> 01:14:18.813]  Yeah, the worst thing about him is he's white!
[01:14:18.833 --> 01:14:22.794]  Alright, so we're now...
[01:14:24.597 --> 01:14:25.819]  45 minutes into the spaces.
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:29.505]  We don't do the spaces where we do it three days before it propagates.
[01:14:29.545 --> 01:14:33.711]  We should, but I do it just to get the commenters from X. It's a way for you to call in.
[01:14:34.893 --> 01:14:37.076]  So, but we are going to do some planned spaces soon.
[01:14:37.577 --> 01:14:38.398]  Got a bunch of spaces.
[01:14:38.438 --> 01:14:39.960]  People got a bunch of info, worse callers.
[01:14:40.852 --> 01:14:48.455]  We got Dr. Selah Emanuel coming on about biblical stuff, coming up in like an hour and a half, or a little over an hour.
[01:14:48.795 --> 01:14:52.596]  So I want to start getting all these calls and getting to these commenters right now.
[01:14:52.616 --> 01:14:55.738]  So let's go to somebody on X. First I want to go to Gray.
[01:14:55.778 --> 01:14:56.938]  Gray, you've been waiting patiently.
[01:14:57.118 --> 01:14:57.918]  I read your bio.
[01:14:58.118 --> 01:15:02.280]  Please unmute yourself, say what you have to say, give the audience a little bit of context of your background.
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:04.541]  Thank you, sir.
[01:15:04.581 --> 01:15:05.161]  I appreciate it.
[01:15:06.042 --> 01:15:10.445]  I was a non-official cover agent raised from birth in a clandestine program.
[01:15:10.745 --> 01:15:19.131]  And what these globalists are doing are raising people to insert into special operations and they go into red cell, red team type of activity.
[01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:23.355]  That is what a lot of this corruption is led under for plausible deniability.
[01:15:23.555 --> 01:15:27.358]  If anybody is caught in the act, it's written off as red team and eventually justified.
[01:15:28.599 --> 01:15:40.508]  For decades now, and going back to the 1995 Advisory Committee for Human Radiation Experimentation, there was testimony presented by Valerie Wolf, Claudia Mullen, and Chris DiNicola.
[01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:45.152]  No, I'm aware of the congressional testimony on declassification of secret radiation testing on children.
[01:15:45.713 --> 01:15:47.314]  So what does that have to do with Trump?
[01:15:47.314 --> 01:15:49.514]  Skipping forward, skipping forward.
[01:15:49.514 --> 01:15:53.354]   So not only are these shooters brainwashing these programs, but so
[01:15:53.354 --> 01:15:55.713]  are the militarized personnel.
[01:15:55.713 --> 01:15:59.873]   And there is a situation where many of these people that are seemingly benign or
[01:15:59.873 --> 01:16:03.474]  on the right side actually have a sub sleeper personality.
[01:16:03.474 --> 01:16:05.993]  Now I am linked up with agents that have been working.
[01:16:05.993 --> 01:16:10.713]   Now I'm linked up with agents that have been working at this for
[01:16:10.713 --> 01:16:13.233]   over 30 years and we have everything we need in the background.
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:18.784]  We merely need some public attention to provide a layer of safety for when we step forward together as a group to give testimony.
[01:16:18.804 --> 01:16:19.765]  Okay, alright.
[01:16:19.785 --> 01:16:24.088]  Well, you're talking so fast I can barely understand what you're saying, but we put you up there.
[01:16:24.108 --> 01:16:25.229]  People can find your information.
[01:16:25.269 --> 01:16:25.629]  Thank you.
[01:16:26.150 --> 01:16:26.650]  Next person.
[01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:29.152]  Let's go to Brooklyn Patriot next.
[01:16:29.212 --> 01:16:31.734]  Brooklyn Patriot, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say.
[01:16:33.431 --> 01:16:34.853]  My name is Brooklyn Patriot.
[01:16:35.294 --> 01:16:37.096]  I'm Patriot from New York, okay?
[01:16:37.457 --> 01:16:39.560]  I'm more well known on Instagram, unfortunately.
[01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:40.901]  I'm just starting out over here.
[01:16:41.502 --> 01:16:45.488]  But I do want to let you guys know that New York is turning red.
[01:16:45.508 --> 01:16:47.871]  People are not blind to what's going on.
[01:16:48.151 --> 01:16:53.877]   People know that there's a satanic A bunch of satanic pedophiles trying to control the world.
[01:16:54.137 --> 01:16:55.298]  Everybody's on to it.
[01:16:55.578 --> 01:17:01.080]  Everybody's on to the same people that did January 6th, did July 13th.
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:03.121]  Everybody's on to the bullshit.
[01:17:03.401 --> 01:17:04.721]  People in New York know it.
[01:17:05.081 --> 01:17:06.282]  People everywhere know it.
[01:17:06.522 --> 01:17:09.363]  And they could try to make New York blue.
[01:17:09.443 --> 01:17:11.203]  They could try to make California blue.
[01:17:11.604 --> 01:17:15.865]  But we the people are the people that control what goes on.
[01:17:16.105 --> 01:17:26.908]   The only problem here in California And in New York is that we get mail-in ballots before an election even starts and that's a problem within itself and what I do want to say is
[01:17:27.896 --> 01:17:31.297]  It's with all the hate going on and everything going on.
[01:17:31.337 --> 01:17:45.299]  People need to pray to God and look up to the heavens and realize that Trump will be our next president and we need to ignore everything that Kamala Harris says or does.
[01:17:45.599 --> 01:17:49.440]  She's irrelevant and there's people pulling her strings behind it all.
[01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:50.600]  She's not black.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.520]  She would not be the first black president.
[01:17:52.861 --> 01:17:55.161]  She's an Indian and everybody knows that.
[01:17:55.521 --> 01:17:55.841]  Okay.
[01:17:56.082 --> 01:17:58.844]  And everything they're trying to do is divide and conquer.
[01:17:58.944 --> 01:18:04.009]  And Democrats love dividing and conquering using color and creed.
[01:18:04.269 --> 01:18:06.110]  They have nothing else to roll out.
[01:18:06.411 --> 01:18:12.436]  And this all started with the Al Smith dinner, when Trump started calling out Hillary with the Watergate committee.
[01:18:12.616 --> 01:18:13.217]  Okay, people forget about it.
[01:18:13.237 --> 01:18:15.339]  No, no, no, but it's also, it's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:18:16.239 --> 01:18:26.373]  The head of, I think it's Columbia, but it's the head of a major university psychological program, and the head of the psychology department says, the only thing we have left is culture war.
[01:18:27.054 --> 01:18:27.815]  And that's what they've done.
[01:18:28.999 --> 01:18:29.420]  That's it.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.502]  It's all about dividing and conquering.
[01:18:31.522 --> 01:18:33.624]  And they divide us and they try to conquer us.
[01:18:33.944 --> 01:18:34.365]  Not us.
[01:18:34.685 --> 01:18:36.947]  They get the Democrats with color and creed.
[01:18:37.408 --> 01:18:38.929]  And that's not supposed to be like that.
[01:18:39.130 --> 01:18:46.497]  But if you remember when Trump spoke at the Al Smith dinner, he called Hillary a traitor.
[01:18:46.577 --> 01:18:51.021]   He said that You know, she raged a village in Haiti.
[01:18:51.161 --> 01:18:52.882]  He was talking all about that different stuff.
[01:18:53.122 --> 01:18:57.865]  And if you looked at the deep state, like Michael Bloomberg's face, they were in shock what he said, okay?
[01:18:58.165 --> 01:19:01.368]  And they don't want him to be president because he's the people's president.
[01:19:01.608 --> 01:19:04.490]  They want somebody from the establishment that can control.
[01:19:05.598 --> 01:19:09.560]  And optimize their goals, not optimize we the people's goals.
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:15.242]  And that's the difference between a patriot and somebody that's a demonic Democrat.
[01:19:15.502 --> 01:19:17.322]  And they want to take away the power from us.
[01:19:17.422 --> 01:19:18.043]  No, I hear you.
[01:19:18.103 --> 01:19:18.923]  Great, great points.
[01:19:18.983 --> 01:19:19.643]  Thank you, sir.
[01:19:19.683 --> 01:19:22.244]  Let's go to some calls now from the Infowars Inn.
[01:19:22.264 --> 01:19:24.545]  And we'll go back to more spaces, speakers.
[01:19:24.945 --> 01:19:25.966]  Frank in New York.
[01:19:26.046 --> 01:19:26.606]  Frank, go ahead.
[01:19:27.853 --> 01:19:36.258]  Yeah, I'd have to disagree with you, Mr. Jones, that Kamala Harris doesn't have any black in her, because I heard from multiple sources that she has black in her multiple times a day.
[01:19:36.278 --> 01:19:38.018]  That's what I heard.
[01:19:38.979 --> 01:19:40.660]  Okay.
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.361]  I also wanted to say something else.
[01:19:45.168 --> 01:19:50.251]  I believe just like that movie Shooter, that guy was set up and he didn't fire one shot.
[01:19:50.852 --> 01:19:54.615]  When the officer went up to check on him, that was a bad actor.
[01:19:54.635 --> 01:19:56.896]  Let me stop you.
[01:19:57.237 --> 01:19:59.098]  Saturday, 11 days ago, I thought of that.
[01:19:59.518 --> 01:20:02.621]  Mark Wahlberg, great movie The Shooter, how they try to set him up as a shooter.
[01:20:03.902 --> 01:20:04.683]  That's what I thought.
[01:20:04.923 --> 01:20:06.265]  And Dews put it together right now.
[01:20:06.765 --> 01:20:12.010]  We have all the videos where the guy's wearing pants and the guy that shoots wearing shorts.
[01:20:12.411 --> 01:20:13.492]  We're getting together right now.
[01:20:13.552 --> 01:20:14.333]  This is a big deal.
[01:20:14.633 --> 01:20:15.494]  This is not adding up.
[01:20:16.914 --> 01:20:17.334]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:17.754 --> 01:20:19.335]  I think the kid got set up.
[01:20:19.355 --> 01:20:21.416]  They pumped him up in some sort of secret thing.
[01:20:21.696 --> 01:20:23.236]  They say he's going to be protecting the President.
[01:20:23.276 --> 01:20:23.756]  You know what I mean?
[01:20:23.796 --> 01:20:25.237]  He wasn't even looking towards the President.
[01:20:25.277 --> 01:20:27.438]  They wouldn't have that banana even looking towards him.
[01:20:27.518 --> 01:20:28.478]  He was just set up, man.
[01:20:28.658 --> 01:20:30.259]  That's what I believe to be true.
[01:20:30.499 --> 01:20:32.580]  Well, definitely it's a stand-down and nobody's buying it.
[01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:33.240]  That's the good news.
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:34.560]  What do you think comes next?
[01:20:36.261 --> 01:20:38.101]  Well, I mean, they could do anything.
[01:20:38.121 --> 01:20:40.322]  You know, our leader just came into town, B.B.
[01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:41.723]  Benjamin Netanyahu.
[01:20:41.743 --> 01:20:44.044]  That's the guy really pulling all the strings to the public.
[01:20:45.934 --> 01:20:49.778]  Exactly, it's a real war, but Israel stands down and lets the attack happen.
[01:20:49.738 --> 01:20:54.298]   now. It's just like it, I mean, this is a same playbook with Israel.
[01:20:54.298 --> 01:20:55.898]  Don't you mean bombing each other?
[01:20:55.898 --> 01:20:56.938]  Just that the other thing.
[01:20:56.938 --> 01:20:59.257]  So anything's on the table.
[01:20:59.257 --> 01:21:01.417]  Anything. Exactly.
[01:21:01.417 --> 01:21:05.018]   It's a real war, but Israel stands down and lets the attack happen.
[01:21:05.018 --> 01:21:07.698]  And it's the same story over and over again.
[01:21:07.698 --> 01:21:10.498]  Yeah, rinse and repeat, brother.
[01:21:10.602 --> 01:21:11.382]  That's all they do.
[01:21:11.682 --> 01:21:14.183]  And the question is, what will they do next?
[01:21:14.243 --> 01:21:15.024]  Thank you, Frank.
[01:21:15.484 --> 01:21:18.325]  Let's go to Aaron Ohio on Trump shooting.
[01:21:19.146 --> 01:21:20.326]  He believes these are false flags.
[01:21:20.346 --> 01:21:20.826]  We'll go to break.
[01:21:20.866 --> 01:21:21.727]  Come back with the ex-speakers.
[01:21:21.767 --> 01:21:23.688]  Go ahead, Aaron.
[01:21:24.728 --> 01:21:29.890]  What they may do next would be to solve the Kamala issue, have a false flag assassination on Kamala.
[01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:30.631]  That does two things.
[01:21:30.711 --> 01:21:32.111]  One, it gets rid of Kamala Harris.
[01:21:32.652 --> 01:21:41.283]   Two, it ensures that the same voters that would be concerned about Wade No, I said they'd try to kill Biden or drug him up at the same time and it happened.
[01:21:41.303 --> 01:21:43.644]  It's a deep state securing its coup over all its minions.
[01:21:43.463 --> 01:21:49.463]   a powerful power play message to that faction that would be behind it.
[01:21:49.463 --> 01:21:50.463]  What do you think about that?
[01:21:50.463 --> 01:21:53.943]   No, I said they'd try to kill Biden or drug him up at the same time.
[01:21:53.943 --> 01:21:55.302]  I mean, it happened.
[01:21:55.302 --> 01:21:56.302]  It's easy to...
[01:21:56.302 --> 01:22:01.264]  It's a deep state securing its coup over all its minions.
[01:22:01.264 --> 01:22:03.583]  I was talking specifically about Kamala.
[01:22:03.583 --> 01:22:06.502]  No, I think there's a very good chance they kill her.
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.202]  I mean, Roger sees all the signs they plan to replace her.
[01:22:09.543 --> 01:22:14.047]  They may not, but yeah, or whoever her VP is, she better watch out for.
[01:22:15.488 --> 01:22:15.689]  Right.
[01:22:16.409 --> 01:22:20.934]  Okay, that's what I wanted to point out because I didn't hear much discussion about that possibility.
[01:22:21.448 --> 01:22:22.088]  Thank you, Aaron.
[01:22:22.549 --> 01:22:22.889]  All right.
[01:22:23.349 --> 01:22:24.049]  We're gonna go to break.
[01:22:24.670 --> 01:22:27.531]  Dennis, Jim, Matt, Garrett, John, Riley.
[01:22:27.571 --> 01:22:28.612]  That's the calls we'll take.
[01:22:28.672 --> 01:22:33.215]  No extra calls, because I want to get the Spaces commenters, Spaces speakers, when we come back.
[01:22:33.575 --> 01:22:35.056]  Chase Geyser, who's up next from X?
[01:22:36.024 --> 01:22:39.247]  We're going to go to Miss Lou, we're going to go to Truth Seeker, Nikki, Dennis, Cole.
[01:22:39.467 --> 01:22:41.950]  We got a bunch of people lined up as well, so yeah, plenty of people.
[01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:43.091]  20 seconds to break.
[01:22:43.131 --> 01:22:44.452]  How epic is this time to be alive?
[01:22:44.592 --> 01:22:45.413]  Oh, it's so epic.
[01:22:45.693 --> 01:22:52.920]  And I got a feeling that we're going to see Kamala Harris as President of the United States before the election, and I don't think she's going to be the candidate.
[01:22:53.985 --> 01:22:59.407]  Yeah, so the 25th Amendment, Biden, and then... Yeah, or he dies of natural causes, or God forbid, you know, they kill him.
[01:22:59.867 --> 01:23:04.669]  Obviously, no violence wanted to come to him, but this is, we're gonna, this is... He hasn't even begun to be crazy yet.
[01:23:04.889 --> 01:23:05.509]  Exactly.
[01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:06.369]  I agree with you.
[01:23:06.489 --> 01:23:11.211]  Crazy town has just begun, and we were supposed to be off the air by now, but we're still here, buddy!
[01:23:11.251 --> 01:23:11.731]  Alright!
[01:23:13.413 --> 01:23:14.574]  It's been sold out for a while.
[01:23:14.814 --> 01:23:17.335]  It is pure deep-earth crystal iodine.
[01:23:17.495 --> 01:23:18.496]  It's so hard to make.
[01:23:18.556 --> 01:23:24.379]  You've got to have DEA-approved labs to do it, and it takes months and months to break it down in this special patented process.
[01:23:24.939 --> 01:23:27.020]  Nobody else has true nascent iodine.
[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:32.983]  They put it on the label, but it's still bound to other elements, and it's not fully absorbable by the cells.
[01:23:33.143 --> 01:23:34.024]  It's the missing link.
[01:23:34.123 --> 01:23:38.882]   Even the UN estimates 2+ billion people have cognitive disabilities because of iodine deficiency.
[01:23:38.882 --> 01:23:43.283]   Up until the 30s we had major IQ reduction because of lack of iodine in the US food supply,
[01:23:43.283 --> 01:23:44.684]  especially in the US Midwest.
[01:23:44.684 --> 01:23:50.042]   From the 30s to the early 80s, the government put crappy iodine in the salt by law.
[01:23:50.042 --> 01:23:53.162]  And IQs went up 15 points on average.
[01:23:53.162 --> 01:23:54.162]  Merton effects went way down.
[01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:56.023]  And then in the early 80s, they took it out again.
[01:23:56.023 --> 01:24:00.123]   This is the deep earth crystal, pure, meaning atomic, on the atomic table.
[01:24:00.123 --> 01:24:02.603]  And it goes into the cells at a cellular level.
[01:24:02.617 --> 01:24:10.644]  Survival Shield X2, now available 25% off, InfoWarsStore.com, 5-star review, or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:24:13.526 --> 01:24:17.750]  All right, I want to play the trailer from Mark Wahlberg, who we know is a patriotic conservative.
[01:24:17.890 --> 01:24:21.953]  I don't care that he's a great actor or like his movies, but we know he's a patriot.
[01:24:21.973 --> 01:24:23.434]  People that are around him is what he does.
[01:24:23.995 --> 01:24:29.959]  But the shooter is such an important movie to watch, and I'm glad that the callers brought that up.
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.541]  Then we'll go to a bunch of spaces, speakers here in a moment.
[01:24:32.902 --> 01:24:35.604]  But man, this movie is all you need to know about how they set stuff up.
[01:24:35.644 --> 01:24:36.004]  Here it is.
[01:24:35.984 --> 01:24:41.484]  [MUSIC]
[01:24:41.484 --> 01:24:42.484]  Come on, boy!
[01:24:42.484 --> 01:24:56.484]  [MUSIC]
[01:24:56.484 --> 01:24:58.984]  Bubbly Swagger, you're a hard man to find.
[01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:00.042]  I'm not hard enough.
[01:25:00.722 --> 01:25:02.864]  There's gonna be an attempt on the life of the president.
[01:25:03.184 --> 01:25:05.626]  The shot will be taken from beyond a mile.
[01:25:06.226 --> 01:25:09.949]  Five or six men in the world make a shot like that.
[01:25:10.049 --> 01:25:16.294]  We need you to stop it.
[01:25:16.314 --> 01:25:20.817]  Out of all the men alive on the planet, you're one of the few people who knows what to look for.
[01:25:24.847 --> 01:25:25.827]  This guy knows what he's doing.
[01:25:25.967 --> 01:25:26.688]  We gotta take him.
[01:25:26.848 --> 01:25:27.368]  This is a setup.
[01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:27.728]  Take him.
[01:25:27.547 --> 01:25:29.547]  Take 'em, take 'em now.
[01:25:29.547 --> 01:25:31.707]  (gunshot)
[01:25:31.707 --> 01:25:36.047]  (explosion)
[01:25:36.047 --> 01:25:42.347]  The would-be assassin, Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger.
[01:25:42.533 --> 01:25:44.134]  I didn't do whatever they said I did.
[01:25:44.793 --> 01:25:46.793]  I'm in some bad trouble and I need some help.
[01:25:46.793 --> 01:25:53.793]  They delivered me on a tray wrapped up like a present.
[01:25:53.793 --> 01:25:55.632]  [GUNFIRE]
[01:25:55.609 --> 01:25:56.750]  Slag is still alive.
[01:25:57.010 --> 01:25:58.411]  That's the hassle with democracy.
[01:25:58.491 --> 01:26:02.975]  There's always a confused soul that thinks that one man can make a difference.
[01:26:03.095 --> 01:26:04.916]  And you have to kill him to convince him otherwise.
[01:26:06.337 --> 01:26:07.878]  In a conspiracy, all those ends are trimmed.
[01:26:08.058 --> 01:26:09.179]  You need to back off this.
[01:26:09.319 --> 01:26:10.020]  Agent Memphis.
[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:10.660]  I got a plan.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:13.742]  I think I'm gonna need your help.
[01:26:13.883 --> 01:26:14.843]  What are you gonna do?
[01:26:14.903 --> 01:26:15.684]  I'm gonna find them.
[01:26:15.984 --> 01:26:17.905]  I'm gonna burn their playhouse down.
[01:26:19.146 --> 01:26:20.788]  This is a Delta-level clearance request.
[01:26:21.148 --> 01:26:22.649]  He's trained in counter-intel.
[01:26:22.809 --> 01:26:23.510]  This guy's good.
[01:26:27.847 --> 01:26:29.488]  I didn't start it, but I mean to see it through.
[01:26:31.329 --> 01:26:31.730]  We got him.
[01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:33.070]  How could you miss?
[01:26:33.130 --> 01:26:34.171]  He was this close to you!
[01:26:34.191 --> 01:26:36.453]  This is about to get worse.
[01:26:36.553 --> 01:26:41.356]  The world ain't ready to change, is it?
[01:26:41.416 --> 01:26:41.836]  No, sir.
[01:26:41.876 --> 01:26:44.198]  You keep that in mind.
[01:26:44.958 --> 01:26:46.099]  I have something you want.
[01:26:46.119 --> 01:26:47.140]  Where are we meeting?
[01:26:47.539 --> 01:27:03.019]   Somewhere I can see you coming from a long way off All right, I want to go back to X spaces and
[01:27:03.019 --> 01:27:09.019]   Start taking your comments here live on air *end*
[01:27:08.459 --> 01:27:11.200]  But you got to go see the movie Shooter that came out like 15 years ago.
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:13.520]  It is dead on with what we're dealing with.
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:19.462]  We've got the clips together where the shooter's got shorts on, then he's got pants on with old people's videos.
[01:27:19.482 --> 01:27:20.142]  This is coming up.
[01:27:20.242 --> 01:27:23.423]  This is... I don't know what's going on exactly, but we're not being told the truth.
[01:27:23.963 --> 01:27:28.084]  Now, a whole separate issue is just in gaslighting.
[01:27:29.923 --> 01:27:33.286]  This is bigger than just Kamala Harris being a puppet.
[01:27:33.966 --> 01:27:35.968]  We're not exposing this just to say, oh, they're a lot.
[01:27:37.769 --> 01:27:39.770]  Why would the corporate media think we're so dumb?
[01:27:40.211 --> 01:27:42.753]  AP, Reuters, Axios, you name it, I've got the articles right here.
[01:27:45.094 --> 01:27:48.997]  Saying that Kamala Harris was never the border czar.
[01:27:49.798 --> 01:27:57.804]  I can show you a hundred newscasts saying she's the border czar and press conferences where she's gonna go fix the border and then only went there one time under pressure.
[01:27:59.503 --> 01:28:00.764]  Why would the deep state do that?
[01:28:00.784 --> 01:28:03.006]  Because they want to train you to hear so many lies.
[01:28:03.067 --> 01:28:08.231]  You know they're a lie, but you get used to hearing the lie and don't get mad about it.
[01:28:08.472 --> 01:28:09.373]  They want you to give up.
[01:28:09.393 --> 01:28:10.093]  They're demoralizing.
[01:28:10.113 --> 01:28:10.413]  Look at this.
[01:28:10.994 --> 01:28:14.617]  Harris border confusion haunts her new campaign.
[01:28:15.158 --> 01:28:18.021]  Axios says she was never the border czar in this article.
[01:28:18.361 --> 01:28:19.122]  I got a bunch of others.
[01:28:20.063 --> 01:28:24.267]  Then we've got the Axios articles from years ago saying she is now the border czar.
[01:28:26.269 --> 01:28:27.790]  Appointed by Biden.
[01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:33.211]  Axios, now, she was never been to Border Czar.
[01:28:35.032 --> 01:28:39.093]  Harris to visit Mexico and Guatemala to address border crossings.
[01:28:40.754 --> 01:28:44.295]  Biden taps VP Harris to lead response to border challenges, AP.
[01:28:45.396 --> 01:28:48.597]  Border Czar, VP Kamala Harris, finally going to border.
[01:28:50.157 --> 01:28:57.196]   Biden tasked Harris with Stemming migration on the southern border, which he opened up and said, if I win the election, immediately surge the border.
[01:28:58.497 --> 01:29:00.619]  Republicans try to make Harris the border czar.
[01:29:01.579 --> 01:29:02.480]  She demurs.
[01:29:04.601 --> 01:29:07.003]  So they're now saying they never did that.
[01:29:07.423 --> 01:29:10.946]  This is another giant lie out in your face.
[01:29:10.986 --> 01:29:11.867]  They think you're stupid.
[01:29:12.287 --> 01:29:13.388]  We've got like five clips.
[01:29:13.428 --> 01:29:16.470]  Just play a few of them and we'll go to the ex-speakers.
[01:29:18.091 --> 01:29:18.992]  But here they are.
[01:29:21.358 --> 01:29:22.546]  Saying she's the Borders are.
[01:29:22.566 --> 01:29:24.319]  Now three years later, never happened.
[01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:30.352]  President Kamala Harris is stepping into a new role, taking the lead on the immigration crisis.
[01:29:30.432 --> 01:29:42.540]  In months of taking office, Vice President Harris was assigned the difficult task of the border, checking in with Central American governments and trying to get to the root causes of immigration problems in the United States.
[01:29:43.181 --> 01:29:48.384]  It has been 91 days since President Biden named Harris as the administration's border czar.
[01:29:48.805 --> 01:29:55.389]  Republicans have heavily criticized her for not visiting the border since then, though she has made other trips to places like Guatemala.
[01:29:55.529 --> 01:30:01.316]  As the border crisis escalates, President Biden is putting the Vice President in charge.
[01:30:01.977 --> 01:30:03.939]  When she speaks, she speaks for me.
[01:30:03.959 --> 01:30:05.661]  She doesn't have to check with me.
[01:30:05.881 --> 01:30:06.982]  She knows what she's doing.
[01:30:07.002 --> 01:30:10.767]  The work will not be easy, but it is important work.
[01:30:13.027 --> 01:30:14.649]  So we're going to put this live clip out.
[01:30:14.669 --> 01:30:17.553]  I don't know what headline to give it on next, but video.
[01:30:17.894 --> 01:30:22.600]  Democrats now claim Kamala Harris was never the border czar or breaking Kamala.
[01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:23.201]  Video.
[01:30:23.481 --> 01:30:25.083]  Kamala Harris appointed border czar.
[01:30:25.164 --> 01:30:25.985]  She now denies it.
[01:30:26.285 --> 01:30:28.768]  I mean, this is like next level lying, Chase.
[01:30:29.617 --> 01:30:31.038]  The gaslighting is unbelievable.
[01:30:31.118 --> 01:30:34.900]  We should do a play on something to do with the czars of Russia, right?
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:38.843]  Like the Bolsheviks attack the borders are, or unseat the borders are.
[01:30:39.223 --> 01:30:41.845]  But they want to have their cake and eat it too, with every single issue.
[01:30:42.205 --> 01:30:46.408]  And we're going to see this play out time and time again until we finally defeat these people.
[01:30:46.988 --> 01:30:48.409]  Well, they think people don't have memories.
[01:30:48.829 --> 01:30:49.030]  Yes.
[01:30:49.370 --> 01:30:52.672]  But they also, again, just want to always deny everything just to get us used to their lying.
[01:30:53.237 --> 01:30:56.978]  And they act as if the mainstream media is the only source of information as well.
[01:30:56.998 --> 01:30:59.438]  I was commenting on this on the American Journal this morning when I was hosting.
[01:31:00.138 --> 01:31:06.000]  If you look at all of the Elizabeth Warren rallies where she tells the same story the exact same way over and over again.
[01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:08.500]  And I got a scholarship to go to college!
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:09.100]  Yay!
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:09.820]  Over and over again.
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:10.481]  There's clip, clip, clip.
[01:31:10.701 --> 01:31:11.961]  And then same thing with Kamala Harris.
[01:31:11.981 --> 01:31:16.882]  You see over and over again she uses that pokey line, what can be unburdened by what has been.
[01:31:17.282 --> 01:31:26.330]  Over and over again, as if it's a rally mainstream media environment and no one's going to realize that she's just repeating the same talking points at rally after rally or speech after speech.
[01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:31.514]  It's like they don't even realize that most people get their information from acts and influencers, not from the mainstream media anymore.
[01:31:31.554 --> 01:31:37.539]  There was a big article on that on siloing and on boomeranging yesterday by Zero Hedge.
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:42.904]  They're believing their own bull while they sit there and lie to people and it's not working.
[01:31:42.964 --> 01:31:44.045]  People know it's the globalists.
[01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:46.126]  They would have confused people, have them give up.
[01:31:46.146 --> 01:31:46.767]  That's not happening.
[01:31:46.787 --> 01:31:48.548]  People are unifying understanding this.
[01:31:48.568 --> 01:31:51.431]  All right, let's go to ex-speakers now.
[01:31:52.091 --> 01:31:53.472]  Dennis, you've had your hand up for the longest.
[01:31:53.492 --> 01:31:55.274]  Why don't you unmute yourself and say what you have to say, sir?
[01:31:56.415 --> 01:31:57.195]  Can you guys hear me okay?
[01:31:57.395 --> 01:31:57.496]  Yes.
[01:31:57.516 --> 01:31:58.056]  Go ahead, yes.
[01:31:59.877 --> 01:32:02.179]  Yeah, I'm having trouble really wrapping my head around.
[01:32:02.199 --> 01:32:11.407]  It could very well be that this was a deep state plot, but it's also, I'm thinking that it could be just blatant incompetence by the Secret Service.
[01:32:12.228 --> 01:32:17.632]  And that this has been going on for a long time, that they've been Swiss cheese for a while, and finally this guy got through the hole.
[01:32:17.652 --> 01:32:32.082]  And the thing that I guess I'm confused on, and haven't really heard many people give an explanation for, is why Trump, of all people that he could have picked for a VP, decides to go with an anti-Trumper in J.D.
[01:32:32.122 --> 01:32:47.887]   Vance, who has a background with Silicon Valley and Peter Thiel and Palantir, with government contracts and the like, And then he goes and disavows all of the Trump loyalists from 2016 that were part of the Heritage Foundation in Project 2025.
[01:32:49.447 --> 01:32:57.110]  So I'm concerned because the rhetoric is definitely not the same with the RNC this year than it was in 2016 with Trump.
[01:32:57.530 --> 01:33:04.993]  And I'm afraid that he's getting sort of enveloped in the deep state itself right now, with even Tucker Carlson.
[01:33:06.103 --> 01:33:19.373]  Tucker Carlson texted, I think it was an AP article, he had texted during the Dominion Voting Systems trial through Discovery how much of a Trump hater he was there too.
[01:33:20.353 --> 01:33:27.038]  And now all of a sudden these guys are Trump fans and it seems to me that it's more because it's politically convenient for them now.
[01:33:27.771 --> 01:33:30.935]  Yeah, but there's also text messages where he says, I love Trump, but I hate him.
[01:33:30.955 --> 01:33:32.717]  I mean, that's like, I've said them on personal text.
[01:33:33.038 --> 01:33:36.062]  God, Trump, it makes me really mad when he was pushing Warp Speed or whatever.
[01:33:36.442 --> 01:33:37.363]  And Tucker's addressed that.
[01:33:38.618 --> 01:33:38.978]  J.D.
[01:33:39.018 --> 01:33:44.040]  Vance, six, seven, eight years ago, did criticize Trump, but since then has made all the right moves.
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:45.121]  That's Trump's decision.
[01:33:45.701 --> 01:33:46.541]  They don't like J.D.
[01:33:46.581 --> 01:33:47.462]  Vance as a choice.
[01:33:48.142 --> 01:33:55.785]  All we've got is Trump right now, but I think what you bring up are legitimate issues, but I don't think there's any way you stage a shooting where it shoots through his ear.
[01:33:55.805 --> 01:33:58.566]  I mean, you're not, you don't think that was a staged shooting, do you?
[01:34:00.476 --> 01:34:02.197]  No, I do not think that was a state shooting.
[01:34:02.497 --> 01:34:16.682]  I think if anything, it may very well have been on purpose, a deep state type thing, whatever you want to call it, or that because the media is so anti-Trump and calling him Hitler, that it drove this kid to do what he did.
[01:34:17.182 --> 01:34:27.806]  And in that movie that you just showed too, I saw that movie so many years ago, but I do remember, I mean, you look at the type of weapon that would be assassin used compared to what this kid used.
[01:34:28.346 --> 01:34:32.872]  I mean, he used an AR-style weapon and he didn't have a scope on it.
[01:34:32.892 --> 01:34:37.118]  I think a lot of people, including snipers, are agreeing that there was no scope on that thing.
[01:34:37.498 --> 01:34:37.619]  Yeah.
[01:34:37.679 --> 01:34:41.223]  And so... I think the consensus is forming that he was just the cover.
[01:34:41.744 --> 01:34:42.445]  It was another shooter.
[01:34:43.883 --> 01:34:45.744]  Yeah, that could very well be possible, too.
[01:34:46.464 --> 01:34:52.567]  And then I find it very strange, too, that there were snipers in the windows in the buildings across the way, too.
[01:34:53.368 --> 01:34:58.910]  Oh yeah, no, no, that's the new video that's been released by Senator Grassley.
[01:34:59.551 --> 01:35:02.012]  It's the local police release that the Secret Service is covering up.
[01:35:02.892 --> 01:35:04.393]  I would play it, but it's like a five-minute video.
[01:35:04.433 --> 01:35:08.055]  It's on my Real Live Jones Channel since last night, like 10 million views now.
[01:35:08.735 --> 01:35:10.376]  They're literally like, oh yeah, he was up there.
[01:35:10.396 --> 01:35:11.017]  We didn't know what to do.
[01:35:11.057 --> 01:35:11.797]  We took photos of him.
[01:35:11.977 --> 01:35:13.418]  There's a guy with a gun, but here's the deal.
[01:35:13.438 --> 01:35:14.499]  We're going to release this video soon.
[01:35:14.979 --> 01:35:20.703]  He's in long pants, jeans, and then later he's in shorts.
[01:35:20.783 --> 01:35:21.703]  Something weird's going on.
[01:35:23.124 --> 01:35:24.445]  And there's no casings on the roof either.
[01:35:24.465 --> 01:35:26.046]  That was something the caller mentioned this morning.
[01:35:26.066 --> 01:35:27.687]  Where are the casings for the shots that he fired?
[01:35:28.849 --> 01:35:32.350]  And then the eight shots thing is obviously concerning too.
[01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:35.451]  I guess we'll find out later on what that's all about.
[01:35:35.511 --> 01:35:40.832]  But Alex, thanks for taking my call and I'm glad that you're still going strong.
[01:35:41.112 --> 01:35:43.893]  And do you mind if I promote my Twitter account?
[01:35:43.913 --> 01:35:45.153]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:35:45.613 --> 01:35:47.794]  It's at Den Hendrickson.
[01:35:48.094 --> 01:35:49.974]  H-E-N-D-R-I-C-K-S-O-N.
[01:35:50.374 --> 01:35:56.396]  Alright, since you mentioned the eight shots, let's play that clip.
[01:35:57.948 --> 01:36:02.272]  FBI Director says the Trump shooter fired at least eight shots.
[01:36:02.933 --> 01:36:05.975]  And I'm not saying the FBI is the definitive answer here, but they've already been all over it.
[01:36:05.995 --> 01:36:06.516]  They've looked at it.
[01:36:06.896 --> 01:36:09.018]  One guy got shot in the back of the head protecting his wife and daughter.
[01:36:09.058 --> 01:36:09.498]  He's dead.
[01:36:09.518 --> 01:36:11.039]  A couple other folks got shot.
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:14.462]  So this was this was a serious situation, obviously.
[01:36:14.822 --> 01:36:18.225]  Here's the FBI director.
[01:36:18.486 --> 01:36:19.787]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[01:36:19.847 --> 01:36:21.208]  Thank you, Director Wray, for being here.
[01:36:21.788 --> 01:36:23.270]  How many shots did the shooter fire?
[01:36:24.891 --> 01:36:30.983]   Well, we we No, that he fired at least eight, because we recovered eight cartridges on the roof.
[01:36:31.523 --> 01:36:31.743]  Okay.
[01:36:32.203 --> 01:36:38.445]  And are all the cartridges and the unspent bullets, have they been, you know how many there are?
[01:36:38.465 --> 01:36:43.087]  You've accounted for all of those?
[01:36:43.887 --> 01:36:44.708]  We believe we have.
[01:36:44.828 --> 01:36:45.588]  We believe we have.
[01:36:45.628 --> 01:36:49.169]  Again, there was lots of work still ongoing, but yes, we believe we have accounted.
[01:36:49.710 --> 01:36:53.591]  And did the recovered shells, the cartridges, match the shooter's rifle?
[01:36:54.872 --> 01:36:55.832]  My recollection is yes.
[01:36:57.421 --> 01:36:59.302]  And you conducted analysis that confirms that?
[01:37:00.603 --> 01:37:10.489]  Uh, well, we work with ATF, but yes, so some of the work has been divided up, but... And, uh, how many shells, uh, casings were recovered from the location of the countersnipers?
[01:37:11.209 --> 01:37:12.330]  I'm sorry, I couldn't hear the last part.
[01:37:12.450 --> 01:37:14.211]  Uh, from the countersnipers' location?
[01:37:15.232 --> 01:37:18.233]  Uh, that I don't have the answer, at least here at my fingertips.
[01:37:18.834 --> 01:37:22.796]  We're hoping to learn more, and we're still exploiting a number of the digital devices.
[01:37:22.816 --> 01:37:23.016]  Right.
[01:37:24.804 --> 01:37:30.548]  I think it's fair to say that we do not yet have a clear picture of his motive.
[01:37:30.668 --> 01:37:36.532]  And I think it's important for me to explain because I understand, of course, why everybody wants to know the answers to those questions.
[01:37:37.693 --> 01:37:55.262]   Often in an investigation, from interviewing people that the subject was in close contact with, looking at the individual's social media accounts, messages, Often things physical evidence in the person's residence, you might see a manifesto, things like that.
[01:37:55.943 --> 01:38:02.270]  We're not seeing that yet, but we are digging in hard because this is one of the central questions for us.
[01:38:03.171 --> 01:38:24.498]   What I can say is that the shooter appears to have Done a lot of searches of public figures in general, but so far we're seeing kind of news articles and things like that, and so the images that have been reported about really what we're talking about there are when you do a news search of an article, the image appears in the cache.
[01:38:25.359 --> 01:38:27.982]  Well, they screwed up bad not getting Trump, Chase.
[01:38:27.822 --> 01:38:33.382]   individual but again I really want to be clear that that's a place that we're
[01:38:33.382 --> 01:38:36.942]  doing a lot of work right now and some more to come on that.
[01:38:36.942 --> 01:38:39.921]  Well they screwed up bad not getting Trump Chase.
[01:38:39.921 --> 01:38:46.301]  Yeah they had they didn't think they were gonna fail at all.
[01:38:44.519 --> 01:38:46.039]  The bargain to the letter.
[01:38:46.059 --> 01:38:48.721]  Yeah, and things would have been so different too.
[01:38:49.241 --> 01:38:54.803]  I mean, they would have been able to get away with shooing in Kamala Harris probably if Trump had been replaced by a Nikki Haley.
[01:38:55.063 --> 01:38:57.644]  But it's totally unconstitutional that it's being confirmed.
[01:38:57.804 --> 01:39:00.625]  Just ignore the primaries, just put her in.
[01:39:01.046 --> 01:39:06.148]  No, you've got a 25th Amendment Joe Biden, and she's got to be brought in, and he's still on the ballot.
[01:39:06.288 --> 01:39:06.708]  They're done.
[01:39:07.108 --> 01:39:22.953]  I just can't believe that Democrats witnessed the Democratic Party, Democratic voters witnessed the Democratic Party steal the primary from Bernie Sanders in 2016, and now they're witnessing the soft coup against Biden now, and they still deny that there was election fraud in 2020.
[01:39:23.193 --> 01:39:27.055]  Like, oh, they would steal primaries, but they would never bring themselves to steal a general election.
[01:39:27.495 --> 01:39:29.536]  And they'll want to indict you if you question it.
[01:39:29.596 --> 01:39:30.136]  Right!
[01:39:30.616 --> 01:39:31.536]  These people, man.
[01:39:31.736 --> 01:39:33.277]  It's like, I think they're waking up in droves.
[01:39:33.357 --> 01:39:34.537]  Honestly, for a long time.
[01:39:34.597 --> 01:39:35.798]  A lot of liberals are waking up.
[01:39:35.838 --> 01:39:36.398]  They're waking up.
[01:39:36.758 --> 01:39:38.059]  And then now they drive the gaslighting.
[01:39:38.099 --> 01:39:39.961]  Oh, Kamala, there's fresh blood.
[01:39:40.001 --> 01:39:40.642]  Everybody loves her.
[01:39:40.922 --> 01:39:44.525]  She was the lowest scoring person of, like, 14 Democrat candidates.
[01:39:44.825 --> 01:39:45.106]  Yes.
[01:39:45.566 --> 01:39:46.367]  In the primaries.
[01:39:46.567 --> 01:39:48.348]  And that's without even mentioning her IQ test.
[01:39:50.050 --> 01:39:51.451]  Lowest scoring there, too, right?
[01:39:51.872 --> 01:39:53.333]  But yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
[01:39:53.373 --> 01:39:54.794]  It's a DEI situation, I think.
[01:39:56.335 --> 01:39:57.076]  What do we do?
[01:39:57.096 --> 01:39:59.899]  Alright, so, uh...
[01:40:00.930 --> 01:40:03.551]  We'll go back to calls in a moment, but let's go back to more X comments.
[01:40:04.292 --> 01:40:05.832]  Sure, let's go to Truthseeker.
[01:40:05.852 --> 01:40:07.713]  Truthseeker, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say.
[01:40:08.674 --> 01:40:09.634]  Hey, what's going on, fellas?
[01:40:10.215 --> 01:40:10.355]  Hey.
[01:40:10.895 --> 01:40:12.256]  Good brother, what do you think's going on?
[01:40:12.316 --> 01:40:13.016]  What do you think's going on?
[01:40:14.117 --> 01:40:17.158]  I believe this has been some predictive programming for quite some time.
[01:40:17.278 --> 01:40:28.304]  I mean, if you actually go back and look at The Economist magazine from 2023, at the end of 2023, in December, you can Google it, it shows a question mark over Trump's right ear.
[01:40:28.844 --> 01:40:30.445]  And then it shows like a dove right above his head.
[01:40:30.965 --> 01:40:34.427]  So I think they've been, this has been like preconditioned for quite some time.
[01:40:34.487 --> 01:40:36.008]  I mean, he even showed the movie Shooter.
[01:40:36.568 --> 01:40:42.731]  Like, they've been hinting at this for quite some time because they want to start a major, like, civil war.
[01:40:42.791 --> 01:40:44.672]  I mean, look, think about the movies that came out.
[01:40:44.712 --> 01:40:47.773]  Like, the actual Civil War movie that just came out recently.
[01:40:47.793 --> 01:40:48.914]  Yeah, I don't know about Shooter.
[01:40:48.934 --> 01:40:51.876]  I don't know about that Economist cover.
[01:40:51.916 --> 01:40:52.556]  I saw that.
[01:40:53.116 --> 01:40:56.598]  But definitely, definitely they're trying to cause a civil war.
[01:40:57.078 --> 01:40:58.659]  Definitely, that's, they admit they want that.
[01:41:00.282 --> 01:41:04.503]  And one last thing I just want to ask, do you think that Biden is even still Biden?
[01:41:04.543 --> 01:41:11.845]  Because I don't know, that clip they showed yesterday of Biden, he like walked extra fast than usual and just didn't even really speak.
[01:41:11.925 --> 01:41:13.925]  So something seems off about that with Biden.
[01:41:14.445 --> 01:41:15.206]  What do y'all think about that?
[01:41:16.406 --> 01:41:17.726]  Yeah, that's an important clip to play.
[01:41:17.746 --> 01:41:18.726]  Does the crew have that?
[01:41:19.707 --> 01:41:25.148]  Last night where Biden gets off the airplane and they say, why'd you resign or why'd you drop out?
[01:41:25.208 --> 01:41:27.128]  He goes, ha ha ha and laughs at them.
[01:41:27.429 --> 01:41:28.749]  Yeah, roll it with audio.
[01:41:28.569 --> 01:41:29.569]  you hear this.
[01:41:29.569 --> 01:41:30.569]  Why did you drop out, Mr. President?
[01:41:30.569 --> 01:41:31.569]  Why did you drop out of the election?
[01:41:31.569 --> 01:41:48.088]  Was it a difficult decision to make?
[01:41:48.088 --> 01:41:49.569]  Look, everybody's saying it's Rubbermask.
[01:41:49.557 --> 01:41:50.718]  Everybody's saying they're body doubles.
[01:41:50.998 --> 01:41:51.178]  Yeah.
[01:41:51.238 --> 01:41:55.861]  No, that's the real rotting Joe Biden with the facelifts and the surgeries.
[01:41:56.302 --> 01:41:57.482]  That's why it doesn't look the same.
[01:41:57.582 --> 01:41:58.323]  It's Joe Biden.
[01:41:58.363 --> 01:41:59.784]  The arrogance, you can't copy it.
[01:42:00.124 --> 01:42:01.865]  It's the same guy I've been watching for 30 years.
[01:42:02.366 --> 01:42:03.827]  He's just out of his mind.
[01:42:04.209 --> 01:42:07.010]  Well, I think some videos that you see of him are probably a double.
[01:42:07.230 --> 01:42:08.450]  I think that one, I agree with you.
[01:42:08.590 --> 01:42:10.010]  Yeah, they admit presidents have doubles.
[01:42:10.291 --> 01:42:10.891]  Right, right.
[01:42:11.011 --> 01:42:20.693]  And Ian Carroll did an outstanding report, we ran it this morning on the American Journal during one of the first five-minute segments, about the history of the masks and how sophisticated they've gotten.
[01:42:20.713 --> 01:42:24.214]  So I think when you see him walking up the stairs and doing a great job, it's probably not him.
[01:42:24.334 --> 01:42:25.755]  When you see him like that, that's probably him.
[01:42:25.775 --> 01:42:30.976]  Remember one time they caught a body double out back at the White House, getting in his car, and it was like a younger guy?
[01:42:31.877 --> 01:42:32.899]  Yeah, it's almost like a meme.
[01:42:32.919 --> 01:42:33.900]  They admit they have that.
[01:42:34.041 --> 01:42:34.241]  Right.
[01:42:34.301 --> 01:42:35.904]  I'm just saying, that was the real Joe Biden.
[01:42:35.944 --> 01:42:36.906]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:42:37.046 --> 01:42:37.226]  I agree.
[01:42:37.246 --> 01:42:39.630]  But they had to crank him up, get him ready.
[01:42:40.612 --> 01:42:43.377]  You know, he is, he is, look at him, that is dementia.
[01:42:44.158 --> 01:42:44.940]  I think he had a stroke.
[01:42:46.531 --> 01:42:47.112]  Barely walked.
[01:42:47.552 --> 01:42:47.732]  Yeah.
[01:42:47.892 --> 01:42:51.836]  I think he stroked out and that's why his voice sounded slurred on CNN the other day.
[01:42:52.136 --> 01:42:55.419]  That's why they had to say he had COVID and put him away for 72 hours to monitor him.
[01:42:55.459 --> 01:42:57.400]  The point is, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:57.620]  Nope.
[01:42:57.961 --> 01:42:58.741]  Let's take a caller.
[01:42:59.202 --> 01:43:00.002]  Let's talk to Dennis.
[01:43:00.022 --> 01:43:01.143]  We'll roll B-roll while he talks.
[01:43:01.163 --> 01:43:02.064]  I'm not going to play the whole clip.
[01:43:02.084 --> 01:43:03.786]  It's on Real Live Alex Jones on X.
[01:43:04.346 --> 01:43:08.426]   of the local police that gave it to Senator Grassley and they're talking about the stand
[01:43:08.426 --> 01:43:12.987]   down, the guy on the roof, nobody doing anything, them videotaping and taking photos of it.
[01:43:12.987 --> 01:43:16.586]   You want to talk about body cam footage of the Trump shooting 11 days ago.
[01:43:16.586 --> 01:43:17.586]  Go ahead, Dennis.
[01:43:17.586 --> 01:43:21.666]  Yeah, two quick points, Mr. Jones.
[01:43:21.666 --> 01:43:25.466]   In that body cam video, we see a body, a gun, but where are the shell casing?
[01:43:25.801 --> 01:43:28.042]  We're told eight casings were found on that rooftop.
[01:43:28.382 --> 01:43:35.884]  That body cam video was taken less than one hour after the failed assassination, but no casings are visible on the rooftop.
[01:43:36.084 --> 01:43:41.746]  In fairness, we could blow it up and look for them, but you can barely even see the gun or the dead body.
[01:43:41.786 --> 01:43:43.446]  I mean, it's all just shaky camera work.
[01:43:43.767 --> 01:43:44.987]  How do we know there's not casings there?
[01:43:46.204 --> 01:43:50.528]  I agree, but I've watched it two or three times, zoomed in on large monitors best I can.
[01:43:50.588 --> 01:43:52.110]  That's decent quality video.
[01:43:53.591 --> 01:44:00.878]  And if they say they removed them, they didn't lay down any evidence markers where they typically would, where they find evidence.
[01:44:02.565 --> 01:44:06.168]  Well, the FBI Director just said they found eight shell casings, so I think that's an important thing.
[01:44:06.528 --> 01:44:09.791]  I'm just saying, we're both watching this video, or anybody watching to see this.
[01:44:10.311 --> 01:44:12.073]  How are you going to tell where a shell casing is in there?
[01:44:12.393 --> 01:44:14.755]  There's all sorts of black spots and skins on that roof.
[01:44:15.035 --> 01:44:17.017]  I don't, I don't, you know.
[01:44:17.477 --> 01:44:21.320]  My second point, feds were pretty quick to dismantle the entire crime scene.
[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:25.704]  The stage, the grandstands, everything was removed before any independent investigation.
[01:44:25.764 --> 01:44:27.585]  Oh, you don't have to convince me it was the stage.
[01:44:27.625 --> 01:44:28.466]  False flag, yeah.
[01:44:30.208 --> 01:44:35.671]  Yeah, but it's going to be difficult to try to recreate the event, take precise measurements of the stage, etc.
[01:44:36.032 --> 01:44:37.553]  So, last point.
[01:44:37.953 --> 01:44:39.434]  We can't let this story fade away.
[01:44:39.494 --> 01:44:41.555]  Everybody needs to order those bulletproof shirts.
[01:44:41.615 --> 01:44:42.656]  I've already done so.
[01:44:43.276 --> 01:44:44.337]  Wear them often.
[01:44:44.597 --> 01:44:46.098]  Keep people thinking about this.
[01:44:46.578 --> 01:44:47.399]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:44:47.917 --> 01:44:49.417]  Thank you brother for the support.
[01:44:49.417 --> 01:44:52.716]   I wasn't cutting him off, I'm just saying you can't tell there's bullet casings, but
[01:44:52.716 --> 01:44:55.037]  the cover-ups there and people aren't buying it.
[01:44:55.037 --> 01:44:58.157]   We have congressmen and senators saying, "We think you tried to kill Trump."
[01:44:58.157 --> 01:45:01.836]   I mean, this is good overall that people aren't going along with it.
[01:45:01.836 --> 01:45:06.317]   When you have bipartisan support for the demanding of a resignation to have Cheadle, that was
[01:45:06.430 --> 01:45:06.971]  Absolutely not.
[01:45:06.991 --> 01:45:07.911]  So what do they do next?
[01:45:07.770 --> 01:45:11.550]   that and others and have it actually work. So I think there are a lot of
[01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:14.270]   Democrats that are very upset about this and I wonder if Joe Biden would have
[01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:17.670]   even resigned, withdrawn from the race had this assassination attempt been
[01:45:17.670 --> 01:45:22.289]   successful. I think he would have stuck it out. Well it's definitely backfiring
[01:45:22.289 --> 01:45:25.030]  on them and nobody's buying this was an accident.
[01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:30.871]   Absolutely not. So what do they do next? Is there a panic mode? Well it's kind of like, you
[01:45:30.871 --> 01:45:36.230]   know, I think what's gonna happen next is similar to if JFK hadn't died.
[01:45:34.409 --> 01:45:39.152]  If the same thing had happened to JFK, if it just had grazed his ear instead, and of course he was the sitting president at the time.
[01:45:39.172 --> 01:45:40.072]  Or shot Conley.
[01:45:40.092 --> 01:45:40.633]  Right.
[01:45:40.653 --> 01:45:41.333]  Or killed his wife.
[01:45:41.453 --> 01:45:42.574]  Imagine if his wife would have got shot.
[01:45:42.594 --> 01:45:48.718]  It would have been, he would have actually shattered the CIA into a thousand pieces, I think, and scattered it to the winds as he had threatened before.
[01:45:49.339 --> 01:45:55.703]  And, you know, Trump came out and said that he was going to declassify all the documents around his own assassination attempt as soon as he goes into office.
[01:45:55.723 --> 01:45:58.745]  I think they're frantically deleting those documents like they did for the MK-11.
[01:45:58.985 --> 01:46:00.987]  And that makes them even more desperate to kill him.
[01:46:01.127 --> 01:46:01.407]  Yes.
[01:46:02.668 --> 01:46:06.131]  To quote the Godfather, they gotta get popped, that's the key.
[01:46:06.711 --> 01:46:07.011]  Yep.
[01:46:07.351 --> 01:46:08.952]  And Trump is pop right now.
[01:46:08.952 --> 01:46:10.711]  Let's jam in one more caller before we go to Brighton.
[01:46:10.711 --> 01:46:12.791]  We'll come back with more spaces, commenters.
[01:46:12.791 --> 01:46:15.591]  Let's go ahead and talk to Garrett in Arizona.
[01:46:15.591 --> 01:46:16.551]  Garrett, you're on the air.
[01:46:16.551 --> 01:46:18.311]  Yeah, hello.
[01:46:18.311 --> 01:46:19.110]  Yeah, go ahead, Garrett.
[01:46:19.110 --> 01:46:20.871]  All right.
[01:46:20.871 --> 01:46:26.311]   First of all, I wanted to start off and talk about Jesus Christ and the country,
[01:46:26.311 --> 01:46:27.831]  the way it was founded.
[01:46:27.831 --> 01:46:33.271]   When you say the Pledge of Allegiance, you are pledging your allegiance to this country
[01:46:33.271 --> 01:46:34.631]  and the ruler of this country.
[01:46:34.631 --> 01:46:35.631]  Um...
[01:46:35.799 --> 01:46:43.664]  So I would pledge my allegiance to God the Eternal Father and to the Holy Spirit and to Jesus Christ who died for our sins and nobody else.
[01:46:45.025 --> 01:46:50.168]  Secondly, let's talk about Donald Trump and let's talk about this shooting.
[01:46:51.389 --> 01:46:56.572]  First of all, you've got to know history of Donald Trump and this goes all the way back into the 90s.
[01:46:56.612 --> 01:46:58.253]  So you know Donald Trump for being rich.
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:00.361]  You know him for being an elite.
[01:47:00.981 --> 01:47:02.482]  You know him for being in real estate.
[01:47:02.662 --> 01:47:04.843]  You know him for being a reality TV star.
[01:47:05.884 --> 01:47:08.865]  You know him for doing WWE wrestling.
[01:47:09.886 --> 01:47:11.307]  You know him for fake news.
[01:47:12.307 --> 01:47:15.789]  You know him by their fruits.
[01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:21.372]  After the shooting happened, who became his spokesperson?
[01:47:22.693 --> 01:47:23.293]  Hulk Hogan.
[01:47:24.756 --> 01:47:25.136]  On TV.
[01:47:25.296 --> 01:47:26.077]  Oh my God.
[01:47:26.277 --> 01:47:27.357]  I've been in movies.
[01:47:27.377 --> 01:47:30.599]  People say I'm fake because I was in a movie and played a part.
[01:47:31.219 --> 01:47:33.280]  I'll come back to you, but this is just BS.
[01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:35.541]  They tried to kill him legitimately.
[01:47:35.561 --> 01:47:38.482]  Hulk Hogan's a great guy.
[01:47:38.502 --> 01:47:40.843]  It just never ends.
[01:47:40.863 --> 01:47:42.744]  I mean, do you wish he got shot saying it's fake?
[01:47:44.537 --> 01:47:57.706]  People don't know, by the way, so, you know, and I'll say this again, that many moons ago, when I was just getting started in all of this, that I remember I used to come on with Alex in 2016 is when we started doing it.
[01:47:58.026 --> 01:47:59.547]  Met you at the RNC in Cleveland.
[01:47:59.567 --> 01:48:01.148]  We did the rally by the river.
[01:48:01.168 --> 01:48:01.609]  Yeah.
[01:48:02.189 --> 01:48:03.490]  With Roger and everyone's there.
[01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:05.491]  And Diamond and Silk were there.
[01:48:05.531 --> 01:48:06.092]  That was great.
[01:48:06.132 --> 01:48:12.239]   We're out here to spite all the threats and exercising your sacred First Amendment We salute you.
[01:48:12.379 --> 01:48:14.205]  The InfoWars salute you.
[01:48:14.446 --> 01:48:16.151]  And you are part of history.
[01:48:16.352 --> 01:48:17.214]  You are the future.
[01:48:17.175 --> 01:48:18.175]  God bless you.
[01:48:18.175 --> 01:48:20.175]  [cheering]
[01:48:20.175 --> 01:48:21.175]  USA!
[01:48:21.175 --> 01:48:22.175]  USA!
[01:48:22.175 --> 01:48:23.175]  USA!
[01:48:23.175 --> 01:48:27.175]   Back then, even before I was at One America, I used to host Hour Four.
[01:48:27.933 --> 01:48:28.453]  You remember that?
[01:48:28.613 --> 01:48:28.833]  Yeah.
[01:48:29.313 --> 01:48:31.594]  And you'd be like, I didn't even know you back then!
[01:48:31.714 --> 01:48:34.695]  And you were, I was just some guy, and you were like, hey, your microphone's not good.
[01:48:34.715 --> 01:48:49.881]  So guys, Alex Jones sends me my first microphone that I've got set up in like a, uh, just like a spare bedroom in the house, and I'm doing it over my laptop, and he goes, oh yeah, yeah, I'm gonna need someone to host Hour Four, but get in there, just do it.
[01:48:49.901 --> 01:48:50.961]  I was like, what do you want me to talk about?
[01:48:51.161 --> 01:48:52.442]  That's whatever you want, I gotta go.
[01:48:52.762 --> 01:48:55.784]  And I'm like, I'm just some, I'm just some guy at that point.
[01:48:55.844 --> 01:48:58.506]  You know, I had been through 2016, we had met, etc, etc.
[01:48:58.566 --> 01:48:59.626]  No, but you were a smart guy.
[01:48:59.666 --> 01:49:06.390]  But it, but it, my point though is that people don't realize how much Alex does behind the scenes to help people.
[01:49:06.671 --> 01:49:28.582]   People don't realize how much that Alex really is just, just generous with his time, generous with his resources, and that's a side, and, and by the way, spends time with your family, and You know, something that I've always tried to say is, like, there's this media caricature of Alex Jones, and I'm like, that's not the guy that I've ever met.
[01:49:28.702 --> 01:49:29.682]  I've never met him.
[01:49:29.802 --> 01:49:31.103]  I've spent plenty of time with him.
[01:49:31.463 --> 01:49:32.983]  I've never met this guy.
[01:49:33.383 --> 01:49:34.564]  He sounds crazy.
[01:49:34.624 --> 01:49:38.725]  I don't know that I'd want to meet the guy that they take you out to be, because that's just not you.
[01:49:38.825 --> 01:49:45.648]  And so, I mean, I just want to take the opportunity real quick to just say thank you for all the help that you gave me when I was getting started.
[01:49:45.748 --> 01:49:51.454]  Well, thank you, Jack, but it wasn't because you were like, I was just, you know, you were a talented, smart guy and making great points.
[01:49:51.494 --> 01:49:53.836]  I'm like, well, hey, you need to get on air and you need to do more.
[01:49:54.217 --> 01:49:54.917]  We're going to go to break.
[01:49:54.958 --> 01:49:55.738]  He's going to take over.
[01:49:55.758 --> 01:49:57.660]  I haven't plugged in three hours.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:58.781]  If we don't do that, we'll be gone.

[01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:10.771]  My dad two years ago said they're going to shut you down.
[01:50:11.171 --> 01:50:12.952]  He went, he already developed the supplements.
[01:50:13.232 --> 01:50:14.932]  He went and set up a warehouse in North Austin.
[01:50:15.232 --> 01:50:16.372]  He's there and he was right.
[01:50:16.873 --> 01:50:18.433]  So great products there.
[01:50:18.453 --> 01:50:21.334]  We've got the Next Level foundational energy.
[01:50:21.934 --> 01:50:25.755]  We've got the 10-hour clean energy turbo force and all the nano silver products.
[01:50:26.335 --> 01:50:28.656]  We've got the rocket rest sleep bed.
[01:50:28.676 --> 01:50:29.336]  It's so amazing.
[01:50:29.376 --> 01:50:32.998]   We've got the Alex, when you're working hard, you've got a bunch of back-to-back flights.
[01:50:33.018 --> 01:50:33.478]  What's good?
[01:50:33.297 --> 01:50:38.297]  the nano silver products everything at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:50:38.297 --> 01:50:41.297]   Alex, when you're working hard you got a bunch of back-to-back flights.
[01:50:41.297 --> 01:50:43.297]  What's good? What should I go for?
[01:50:43.297 --> 01:50:46.297]  These sub-molecules are all so strong I barely take them.
[01:50:46.297 --> 01:50:49.297]  But they'll really work well. I mean I take them all.
[01:50:49.297 --> 01:50:51.297]  I haven't taken any today.
[01:50:51.290 --> 01:50:52.932]  I should have, because I was up until 2 a.m.
[01:50:52.972 --> 01:50:53.492]  last night.
[01:50:54.273 --> 01:50:55.534]  But they're all excellent.
[01:50:55.554 --> 01:50:56.415]  They're all just clones.
[01:50:56.435 --> 01:50:57.537]  I've already met so many guys.
[01:50:57.677 --> 01:50:59.859]  I want to get some before I get back on that plane.
[01:50:59.879 --> 01:51:00.520]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:02.942]  Okay, well, I'm going to tell you right now what you want.
[01:51:02.983 --> 01:51:05.165]  I'm going to tell you what you want right now.
[01:51:05.325 --> 01:51:05.565]  Yeah?
[01:51:06.326 --> 01:51:07.988]  You want... No, that's Rocket Rush.
[01:51:08.028 --> 01:51:08.669]  You need to sleep.
[01:51:08.769 --> 01:51:09.450]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:51:09.850 --> 01:51:10.991]  Well, I'm going to take that later tonight.
[01:51:12.768 --> 01:51:14.048]  Next level foundational energy.
[01:51:14.569 --> 01:51:14.949]  There it is.
[01:51:14.969 --> 01:51:15.229]  Let me see.
[01:51:15.429 --> 01:51:16.729]  And there's no speed in that.
[01:51:17.009 --> 01:51:18.450]  It's a methyl folate to break down.
[01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:19.170]  Oh, wow.
[01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:20.290]  Oh, yeah.
[01:51:20.370 --> 01:51:23.471]  It's methyl folate to break down of what's in spinach.
[01:51:23.651 --> 01:51:24.511]  There's a lot in here.
[01:51:24.531 --> 01:51:26.572]  There's a ton in here.
[01:51:26.632 --> 01:51:27.832]  The point is, it's a great product.
[01:51:28.232 --> 01:51:31.793]  This isn't one of the ones where they, you know, put the cotton in on the top so you only get a little bit.
[01:51:31.833 --> 01:51:32.314]  This is full.
[01:51:32.454 --> 01:51:39.454]  You're nice to support us.
[01:51:39.454 --> 01:51:47.414]   Alright, look, I'm not mad at Garrett, and I'm not upset that he asked questions.
[01:51:47.452 --> 01:51:53.837]  The questions are important, but Trump's been involved in movies, TV shows, everywhere, did some...
[01:51:54.793 --> 01:51:55.974]  Professional wrestling stuff.
[01:51:56.834 --> 01:52:00.877]  We know when we watch him with Vince McMahon doing a joke piece that's separate.
[01:52:00.897 --> 01:52:04.159]  It's like when the media says, Jones has been in a few movies, he's an actor.
[01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:05.320]  They play that game.
[01:52:05.961 --> 01:52:08.062]  When I'm an actor in a movie, you know I'm an actor in a movie.
[01:52:08.342 --> 01:52:09.843]  When I'm on this show, it's me.
[01:52:10.464 --> 01:52:21.230]   So the idea that Trump has done some wrestling and now that Hulk Hogan, who called into the show 10 years ago and I know was a listener, Is now saying screw this, this is wrong with 7 America.
[01:52:21.550 --> 01:52:28.753]  It's like this weird thing like Alex Jones is in the same city as Stratford, some CIA propaganda firm.
[01:52:29.533 --> 01:52:32.494]  And they go well that's it, he's in a town of 2 million, he works for Stratford.
[01:52:33.055 --> 01:52:33.915]  It's mentally retarded.
[01:52:34.807 --> 01:52:36.067]  And I'm 100% real.
[01:52:36.347 --> 01:52:37.768]  I'm up here calling what's going on.
[01:52:37.808 --> 01:52:38.708]  I'm defending the Republic.
[01:52:39.008 --> 01:52:41.429]  But people do this thing like, oh, it's all staged.
[01:52:41.449 --> 01:52:42.209]  Well, then you're staged.
[01:52:42.629 --> 01:52:43.569]  In fact, I'll go to Garrett in a minute.
[01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:45.250]  But Garrett, I say you're CIA.
[01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:47.190]  I say everybody's bad.
[01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:48.111]  Nobody's good.
[01:52:48.191 --> 01:52:48.751]  You're bad.
[01:52:49.031 --> 01:52:50.011]  You work for Hulk Hogan.
[01:52:50.691 --> 01:52:53.092]  It is the same mindset.
[01:52:53.192 --> 01:52:53.772]  I know Trump.
[01:52:53.812 --> 01:52:54.312]  He's real.
[01:52:54.352 --> 01:52:54.932]  He's not perfect.
[01:52:55.292 --> 01:52:56.033]  He got shot.
[01:52:56.573 --> 01:53:00.854]  The deep state has done all these indictments and all these attacks and done all these things.
[01:53:02.236 --> 01:53:05.360]  So, professional wrestling is a super popular thing.
[01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:06.221]  It's Americana.
[01:53:06.801 --> 01:53:07.762]  And so is UFC.
[01:53:07.823 --> 01:53:09.064]  Trump's associated with it all.
[01:53:09.945 --> 01:53:12.308]  I mean, hell, I'm associated with it because I know Joe Rogan forever.
[01:53:12.328 --> 01:53:13.589]  I'm into UFC things, you name it.
[01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:18.615]  So, my issue here is they don't fake somebody getting shot in the ear.
[01:53:18.996 --> 01:53:19.576]  You can see it.
[01:53:19.656 --> 01:53:20.798]  Real people died there.
[01:53:21.818 --> 01:53:29.382]  And so it's just, to me, preposterous when this is going down and the deep state is definitely against Trump to then say it stayed.
[01:53:29.402 --> 01:53:36.205]  So explain to me, you mentioned a bunch of stuff, oh he knows Hulk Hogan and he was in movies so that means he's whatever.
[01:53:36.766 --> 01:53:40.607]  Explain it to me, what are you saying Trump did, who is he working for?
[01:53:40.667 --> 01:53:42.809]  Do we vote for Joe Biden or do we vote for Kamala Harris?
[01:53:43.049 --> 01:53:43.529]  What are you saying?
[01:53:44.597 --> 01:54:03.558]  I say you vote for none of the above and you vote for Jesus Christ and you start telling all the info warriors out there to repent from idol worship and to vote for Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ only because he's the only one that's going to save us from any of this and you can... Let me ask you, let me ask you.
[01:54:03.838 --> 01:54:04.639]  Am I a fake?
[01:54:04.739 --> 01:54:05.420]  Am I an actor?
[01:54:07.043 --> 01:54:08.884]  I don't think you're an actor all the time.
[01:54:08.904 --> 01:54:15.425]  I think you might say you have some of the truth, but you might not be telling everybody the whole truth.
[01:54:16.545 --> 01:54:17.526]  Well, I'm not God.
[01:54:17.546 --> 01:54:18.486]  I appreciate your call.
[01:54:18.926 --> 01:54:19.986]  So I don't know the whole truth.
[01:54:20.746 --> 01:54:24.387]  But I'll assure you, son, that I'm telling what I believe to be the truth.
[01:54:24.667 --> 01:54:25.748]  That is my North Star.
[01:54:25.808 --> 01:54:26.828]  That is what I want to hit.
[01:54:28.069 --> 01:54:30.570]  God, these people don't believe there's good.
[01:54:31.230 --> 01:54:32.830]  There's not just evil, folks.
[01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:33.851]  There's good, too!
[01:54:34.311 --> 01:54:37.852]  Well, when you spend your whole life in Mordor, it's hard to believe that this place like the Shire exists.
[01:54:38.892 --> 01:54:39.432]  Exactly.
[01:54:39.492 --> 01:54:40.173]  That's a good point.
[01:54:41.033 --> 01:54:46.094]  People live in Mordor, so they don't believe that anything good exists.
[01:54:46.534 --> 01:54:46.714]  Yeah.
[01:54:47.235 --> 01:54:47.875]  It's a dark time.
[01:54:48.375 --> 01:54:50.215]  And that's part of waking people up, is showing them the light.
[01:54:50.275 --> 01:54:53.356]  And just like in The Matrix, when he uses his eyes for the first time, he's like, my eyes hurt.
[01:54:53.456 --> 01:54:55.557]  Morpheus says, because you've never used them before.
[01:54:56.522 --> 01:54:56.762]  Right.
[01:54:56.842 --> 01:54:58.683]  It's an allegory of the cave in the Matrix.
[01:54:58.723 --> 01:55:00.763]  They redid the interpretation for that movie.
[01:55:01.204 --> 01:55:03.204]  It hurts when you see the light for the first time, but the light is real.
[01:55:04.505 --> 01:55:04.745]  Yeah.
[01:55:04.885 --> 01:55:06.345]  I mean, to me, the light is everything.
[01:55:07.106 --> 01:55:16.649]  And so people sit back all day and analyze what I do or I go, I'll tell a story about this symbol used to mean in Italy, ward off the devil.
[01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:19.530]  And then the Satanists took it over.
[01:55:19.871 --> 01:55:25.892]  And I'm saying a symbol, like a swastika was an Indian symbol, a Hindu symbol, a Buddhist symbol, and then Hitler took it over.
[01:55:27.293 --> 01:55:28.293]  And so I show a swastika.
[01:55:28.313 --> 01:55:29.373]  They go, look, he's showing a swastika.
[01:55:29.673 --> 01:55:31.914]  No, I'm showing this not in reverence to the devil.
[01:55:32.494 --> 01:55:34.875]  I'm showing this to show how a symbol can be anything.
[01:55:34.895 --> 01:55:35.715]  And people go, look!
[01:55:36.015 --> 01:55:37.855]  They'll take a screenshot of this today.
[01:55:37.875 --> 01:55:39.416]  They go, look, Jones just did this.
[01:55:39.456 --> 01:55:39.956]  Well, do it!
[01:55:40.516 --> 01:55:41.978]  Because I'm not doing this in reference to the devil.
[01:55:42.258 --> 01:55:43.400]  It's just my fingers.
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:44.421]  It's something I can do.
[01:55:44.902 --> 01:55:50.889]  You need to judge people by the character of their deeds, by the fruits of the tree.
[01:55:52.110 --> 01:55:53.972]  Not by the symbol.
[01:55:53.992 --> 01:55:55.614]  Because symbols can mean anything.
[01:55:56.554 --> 01:55:57.355]  It's incredible.
[01:55:57.636 --> 01:56:00.079]  But it must be easy to sit back and say, everybody's bad but yourself.
[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:03.744]  That must feel, it's like a Pharisee, you know, that's what they said about Christ.
[01:56:03.844 --> 01:56:05.567]  Oh, he's not good, we are, he's bad.
[01:56:06.187 --> 01:56:08.330]  So, okay, great, you're the good guy, I'm the bad guy.
[01:56:08.691 --> 01:56:09.232]  Tell us what to do.
[01:56:09.332 --> 01:56:10.033]  Please save us, sir.
[01:56:10.373 --> 01:56:11.114]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:56:11.915 --> 01:56:15.516]  Time waits for no man, and we are the InfoWar.
[01:56:15.877 --> 01:56:18.718]  I'm Alex Jones, your host in a simulcast on X Spaces.
[01:56:19.218 --> 01:56:22.439]  And taking your calls, we've got a special guest coming up in about 25 minutes.
[01:56:22.759 --> 01:56:25.640]  So Chase Geiser, let's go to these X Space commenters.
[01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:29.922]  Then we'll go to Matt, Jim, Riley, and John on the phone calls.
[01:56:29.942 --> 01:56:30.242]  Go ahead.
[01:56:30.542 --> 01:56:33.823]  Alright, well let's go first to Joseph Phillip Daniel, and then we'll go to Miss Lou.
[01:56:33.843 --> 01:56:35.964]  But Joseph Phillip Daniel, if you're still with us, go ahead and speak.
[01:56:37.125 --> 01:56:37.705]  I love you all.
[01:56:37.905 --> 01:56:40.246]  Thank you, Jesus Christ, for Alex Jones.
[01:56:41.314 --> 01:56:43.195]  Fill them with the spirit over and over again this year.
[01:56:43.455 --> 01:56:48.198]  God, make InfoWars get more and more money on a month-to-month basis.
[01:56:48.578 --> 01:56:53.541]  Give them more... You're overdriving your microphone.
[01:56:53.561 --> 01:56:54.422]  Just settle down.
[01:56:54.442 --> 01:56:56.563]  Relax.
[01:56:58.184 --> 01:56:58.804]  I think he's cutting out.
[01:56:58.824 --> 01:56:59.725]  It sounds like he might be outside.
[01:56:59.745 --> 01:57:01.286]  I think he's cutting in and out a little bit.
[01:57:01.346 --> 01:57:04.408]  Let's move on to Miss Lou first and then we'll have... That folks are so excited.
[01:57:04.428 --> 01:57:04.968]  They're screaming.
[01:57:04.988 --> 01:57:05.728]  You can't hear them.
[01:57:05.829 --> 01:57:06.209]  That's great.
[01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.829]  Go ahead Miss Lou.
[01:57:06.849 --> 01:57:08.130]  Unmute yourself and say what you have to say.
[01:57:10.197 --> 01:57:13.499]  Hey Alex, hey Chase, thank you so much for everything.
[01:57:13.519 --> 01:57:14.220]  Thank you.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:16.641]  Listen, I've got a couple points here and I'll keep it quick.
[01:57:17.342 --> 01:57:28.510]  Two breakings, I don't know you guys probably know about this, but Mike Benz on X was saying that the Trump campaign has been notified by the Secret Service that they should have no more outdoor rallies.
[01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.950]  Yeah.
[01:57:29.130 --> 01:57:30.511]  Now you know what that means.
[01:57:30.551 --> 01:57:33.233]  They don't like the optics of the crowd, so we're going to shut that down.
[01:57:33.273 --> 01:57:35.674]  We can't kill him, so we'll just keep killing his chances.
[01:57:36.755 --> 01:57:39.177]  The second point I want to make is from Eric Prince.
[01:57:39.938 --> 01:57:49.783]  Who's on War Room, who addressed the idea of the private security notion, and he said the problem with that is, for Trump, is that you can't combine private and government.
[01:57:50.384 --> 01:57:51.424]  They don't marry well.
[01:57:52.565 --> 01:58:00.449]  So, I think, in my opinion, that Trump ought to dump the Secret Service from now to the time of the election to say, sorry guys, don't need you.
[01:58:01.204 --> 01:58:03.786]  And really hire the real deals.
[01:58:03.806 --> 01:58:12.513]  That's a great idea, but I mean, Trump is, from my sources, he himself understands he shouldn't do outdoor events, so that's not just Secret Service saying that.
[01:58:13.914 --> 01:58:14.595]  Okay, good.
[01:58:15.035 --> 01:58:20.119]  And the third thing I have, just a little levity, I have a new name for Camelot, and I hope it sticks.
[01:58:20.159 --> 01:58:25.083]  By the way, I kind of agree with Chase, they might pull a last minute switch, but the problem with that is twofold.
[01:58:25.203 --> 01:58:30.688]  One, they've already screwed their base on the primary, and she was on the first ticket.
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:36.162]  And the second thing is she is a complete, absolute toady for the deep state.
[01:58:36.602 --> 01:58:38.643]  She will do anything they say.
[01:58:39.124 --> 01:58:45.947]  And so, like Biden, she's Biden only younger and in heels, but she's more evil because she is a lawyer.
[01:58:47.008 --> 01:58:51.250]  And also, my name for her is Kamila.
[01:58:52.546 --> 01:58:53.626]  Combining coming.
[01:58:53.907 --> 01:58:54.267]  I love it.
[01:58:54.307 --> 01:58:56.107]  Communists with Kabbalah.
[01:58:56.147 --> 01:58:56.728]  Kamila.
[01:58:57.148 --> 01:58:58.308]  Yes, Kamila.
[01:58:58.348 --> 01:58:59.349]  Yeah, or Kabbalah.
[01:58:59.409 --> 01:59:00.589]  And that should stick.
[01:59:01.249 --> 01:59:04.010]  Yeah, you know, I mean, Kabbalah is another good one.
[01:59:04.030 --> 01:59:04.591]  Yeah, that's good.
[01:59:04.671 --> 01:59:11.133]  But Kabbalah also has other meanings, you know, in Jewish, you know, stuff.
[01:59:12.194 --> 01:59:15.155]  So anyway, so that's that's what I had to say.
[01:59:15.215 --> 01:59:15.935]  Thank you for the mic.
[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:19.420]  Great points.
[01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:20.801]  I appreciate you calling in.
[01:59:20.821 --> 01:59:22.361]  Let's go to the next person.
[01:59:22.581 --> 01:59:23.862]  Okay, let's go to Nikki.
[01:59:24.022 --> 01:59:27.383]  Nikki, go ahead and unmute yourself if you're still with us and say what you have to say in the space.
[01:59:27.403 --> 01:59:29.464]  Hey, guys.
[01:59:29.524 --> 01:59:30.184]  I'm still here.
[01:59:31.845 --> 01:59:33.346]  Thanks, Alex, for having us.
[01:59:33.366 --> 01:59:33.626]  Thank you.
[01:59:33.646 --> 01:59:35.126]  Thank you for being here.
[01:59:36.147 --> 01:59:39.828]  You know, just listening to everything going on is just batshit crazy.
[01:59:39.888 --> 01:59:43.409]  Like, the times we're living in, wild as hell.
[01:59:46.236 --> 02:00:13.311]   I have a question about you know you said there's a guy in pants and a guy in shorts did you guys notice that there's a guy that's almost he's dressed almost exactly like the shooter sitting kind of on the side of the building like looking up at him because I had like I was going through stuff and there are pictures of him and he has the same color shirt the same color They look like the same colors, but I thought that was kind of odd.
[02:00:13.751 --> 02:00:15.592]  Well, what you're doing is asking questions.
[02:00:15.672 --> 02:00:20.616]  That's something the FBI director and the Secret Service director now fired or resigned doesn't want.
[02:00:20.656 --> 02:00:21.617]  Yeah, they hate that.
[02:00:22.177 --> 02:00:22.817]  They hate that.
[02:00:23.398 --> 02:00:34.105]  And also, it looks like, you know, early on, I was like, where did this picture of the shooter come from that looked like he was kind of sitting in that position where there was kind of like a grass?
[02:00:34.646 --> 02:00:40.998]   And it's literally the same spot above It would have had to have been taken from that second floor window.
[02:00:41.018 --> 02:00:45.123]  I haven't played the video because it's five minutes long.
[02:00:46.485 --> 02:00:53.174]  Senator Grassley released last night local police cam with the Secret Service basically admitting all this.
[02:00:53.615 --> 02:00:55.658]  And then you have the Secret Service Command Center.
[02:00:57.722 --> 02:00:58.443]  Yeah, it had to be.
[02:00:58.262 --> 02:01:02.023]   50 feet from the shooter in the building above it with their open window.
[02:01:02.023 --> 02:01:03.021]  So this is crazy.
[02:01:03.021 --> 02:01:05.462]  So all the crowds like, "Shooter, shooter, shooter!"
[02:01:05.462 --> 02:01:07.021]  He's walking around for 26 minutes.
[02:01:07.021 --> 02:01:08.021]  They do nothing.
[02:01:08.021 --> 02:01:09.382]  This was a stand down.
[02:01:09.382 --> 02:01:11.342]  Yeah, it had to be.
[02:01:11.342 --> 02:01:13.222]  I mean, there's no doubt about it.
[02:01:13.222 --> 02:01:17.822]   That photo that was circulated was definitely, there's no other spot it could have been taken
[02:01:17.822 --> 02:01:19.461]  from.
[02:01:19.253 --> 02:01:26.274]   And then what's the question too, like, you know, there's a van involved and then there's the Hyundai
[02:01:26.274 --> 02:01:30.833]   and there's a, like, I don't know, you know, when Ray was talking about it,
[02:01:30.833 --> 02:01:34.793]  he was referring to a car, he wasn't referring to a van.
[02:01:34.793 --> 02:01:37.773]   So it'd be interesting, like, did they ever go to Home Depot
[02:01:37.773 --> 02:01:41.273]  and get the cams to see like, what kind of vehicle?
[02:01:41.273 --> 02:01:42.354]  Here's what's happening.
[02:01:42.354 --> 02:01:44.993]  They want us to get all caught up in the minutia.
[02:01:44.993 --> 02:01:49.113]   They wanted to remove Trump, they had CIA people on TV saying they're gonna kill him
[02:01:49.113 --> 02:01:51.354]  and Chuckie Schumer and all the rest of them.
[02:01:51.354 --> 02:01:55.573]   And then you've got all the lawfare and all the criminal charges and all the fake trials
[02:01:55.573 --> 02:01:58.394]   and trying to take him off the ballot, them saying we're gonna kill him.
[02:01:58.394 --> 02:02:00.693]  And then this happens and there's a stand down.
[02:02:00.466 --> 02:02:01.126]  They did it.
[02:02:01.146 --> 02:02:03.508]  98% of the evidence points towards that.
[02:02:03.829 --> 02:02:05.710]  You'd have to override your common sense.
[02:02:06.391 --> 02:02:10.433]  And so now members of Congress and others are saying, we know you tried to kill him.
[02:02:10.773 --> 02:02:11.954]  That freaks the deep state out.
[02:02:11.994 --> 02:02:15.155]  If they know people aren't buying their story, they won't try it again.
[02:02:15.195 --> 02:02:22.359]  That's why I said 11 days ago, and I said again today and yesterday, the day before, the day before that, we've got to point out we don't buy any of this.
[02:02:23.593 --> 02:02:30.875]  Right, and then I saw another video today where they were showing a guy with a beard with no shirt and they were kind of detaining him.
[02:02:30.955 --> 02:02:40.617]  But my question from the beginning was, you know, when this first started, how did this Maxwell guy, like, how did his name even become part of this?
[02:02:41.417 --> 02:02:44.198]  And, you know, the second guy, they all sort of looked the same.
[02:02:44.218 --> 02:02:48.219]  You said Maxwell, did you mean Thomas Matthew Crooks?
[02:02:48.279 --> 02:02:48.879]  Is that what you meant?
[02:02:49.999 --> 02:02:50.259]  No.
[02:02:50.279 --> 02:02:51.560]  Okay, I'm lost then.
[02:02:51.580 --> 02:02:51.780]  I'm sorry.
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:52.300]  Go ahead.
[02:02:53.461 --> 02:02:57.504]  There was a Maxwell Yurek, his name was released with this, right?
[02:02:57.944 --> 02:03:01.706]  And it was even, you know, posted on an MSN article.
[02:03:01.906 --> 02:03:04.468]  Well, they were questioning a lot of people, but here's the bottom line.
[02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:11.392]  Kamala Harris is now claiming she was never the Borzar.
[02:03:12.563 --> 02:03:14.883]  So they've gone to full war mode where you just lie.
[02:03:15.324 --> 02:03:18.144]  In World War I, the Germans would play loudspeaker saying, we're not assaulting you.
[02:03:18.164 --> 02:03:19.925]  That's where that started.
[02:03:20.085 --> 02:03:23.245]  Tanks are rolling, thousands of troops, no one's assaulting.
[02:03:23.305 --> 02:03:30.027]  And a small percentage of the troops on the Allied side, the French, the British, the US, the Russian, would just give up.
[02:03:30.047 --> 02:03:31.347]  Well, they just said there's not a war.
[02:03:32.167 --> 02:03:36.128]  So they're telling you, remember the first day, they said nobody tried to kill Trump.
[02:03:36.148 --> 02:03:37.788]  So that's what you've got to understand.
[02:03:37.808 --> 02:03:38.508]  Thank you so much.
[02:03:39.168 --> 02:03:41.309]  Let's go ahead and go to another caller on the InfoWars side.
[02:03:42.614 --> 02:03:43.954]  Matt in Indiana on the Trump shooting.
[02:03:43.974 --> 02:03:44.275]  Go ahead.
[02:03:46.615 --> 02:03:46.975]  Hey, Alex.
[02:03:47.015 --> 02:03:48.176]  Great to talk to you again.
[02:03:48.856 --> 02:03:51.397]  Love you, brother, and pray for you nightly.
[02:03:51.817 --> 02:03:54.217]  I did log some time in Mordor.
[02:03:55.258 --> 02:04:02.040]  So with that, I ran a cabinet level table top exercise for Biden's 2020 inauguration.
[02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:11.956]   And I'm just saying from that experience, we can rule out this, you know, incompetence, Start over and you've got the floor.
[02:04:11.996 --> 02:04:15.678]  You're saying you worked in the federal government with Biden's inauguration.
[02:04:15.698 --> 02:04:19.499]  You don't have to give specifics, but just tell us the area you're working in and what you're saying.
[02:04:19.519 --> 02:04:20.400]  We can rule this out.
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:20.980]  Start over.
[02:04:22.141 --> 02:04:23.621]  Yeah, I appreciate that, Alex.
[02:04:24.682 --> 02:04:27.743]  So let me just say, it was a whole government effort, right?
[02:04:27.803 --> 02:04:33.286]  So you've got federal, state, local... Let's be clear.
[02:04:33.306 --> 02:04:34.786]  I'm going to interrupt you again and you'll have the floor.
[02:04:35.107 --> 02:04:36.327]  You're saying you worked in this.
[02:04:36.607 --> 02:04:37.968]  So start over with that.
[02:04:39.195 --> 02:04:45.877]  Yeah, I'm saying that I ran the cabinet-level tabletop exercise for Biden's 2020 inauguration.
[02:04:46.017 --> 02:04:47.037]  Wow.
[02:04:47.057 --> 02:04:52.318]  So, not the actual event, but the tabletop exercise.
[02:04:52.338 --> 02:04:52.678]  The war.
[02:04:54.019 --> 02:04:55.259]  Precisely, precisely.
[02:04:55.799 --> 02:05:11.163]   So, now, this was a presidential inauguration, so security is going to be more heightened than a former president doing a campaign event, but however, I mean, it's It's clear to me that we need to rule out the incompetent here.
[02:05:11.483 --> 02:05:19.408]  These are not keystone cops that we're dealing with, and this certainly wasn't a conservative false flag, and I'll get more into this, but you've got layers of security.
[02:05:19.428 --> 02:05:24.312]  We talked about federal, state, local layers of surveillance and effects.
[02:05:25.072 --> 02:05:36.080]  You know, they can have lethal, as we saw apply, there's also non-lethal effects that they can employ too during these events to block communications or other things.
[02:05:36.625 --> 02:05:43.949]  You know, different layers of leadership that's on-site leadership, and they probably have an ops center, presumably, somewhere.
[02:05:45.090 --> 02:05:56.337]  So, all of this stuff is leading me to believe that it's highly probable that this assassination attempt on President Trump was an interagency coordinated event with key political family support.
[02:05:56.917 --> 02:06:06.770]   As we look out, you know, first we've got the very telling Austin Private Wealth LLC With the put options on 12 million Trump shares.
[02:06:08.111 --> 02:06:11.174]  And we saw some of the names associated with that effort.
[02:06:12.035 --> 02:06:17.399]  Next, we've got Joe Biden's campaign, which pulled some resources.
[02:06:17.439 --> 02:06:42.326]   And I know the Secret Service pushed back on this, but I would be curious to do some more data mining on that and figure out the timing of when President Trump had his campaign rally planned and when Joe Biden's came up on the map and, you know, where you could easily reallocate some of those critical presidential protection detail assets to Joe Biden's campaign.
[02:06:42.727 --> 02:06:53.898]  And because of that, we saw, you know, untrained or inappropriate characteristics of agents assigned to, you know, defend President Trump and protect him.
[02:06:54.617 --> 02:06:58.058]  So, that's just my observations, Alex.
[02:06:58.659 --> 02:07:07.402]  Well, you sound very credible, and I find this intriguing, and I believe you're telling the truth, but you're saying you ran the tabletop of the 2020 inauguration of Biden.
[02:07:07.442 --> 02:07:09.603]  People can figure out who you are by you saying that.
[02:07:09.983 --> 02:07:11.123]  So, were you with the Secret Service?
[02:07:11.143 --> 02:07:12.104]  Were you with Homeland Security?
[02:07:12.124 --> 02:07:14.725]  I mean, you've basically already said it, if you're who you say you are.
[02:07:15.185 --> 02:07:20.787]  And specifically, you're saying from that understanding, you're basically saying you see the obvious stand down here?
[02:07:23.959 --> 02:07:33.703]  I see obvious holes there, that if you've participated in something like that, you see all the redundancy built into the system to prevent anything like this from happening.
[02:07:33.803 --> 02:07:36.404]  Yeah, how is this guy on the roof for 26 minutes?
[02:07:36.965 --> 02:07:39.446]  How does everybody else see him screaming and yelling?
[02:07:39.746 --> 02:07:42.967]  And you said Secret Service Center, that was in the higher building above him.
[02:07:43.027 --> 02:07:44.268]  We have that video, we'll roll it right now.
[02:07:45.008 --> 02:07:47.249]  They were above where the shooter climbed up.
[02:07:49.768 --> 02:07:50.789]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:07:51.049 --> 02:07:58.673]  I don't want to disclose what organization I was involved with, just because that opens up another can of worms.
[02:07:58.733 --> 02:08:03.456]  But yeah, nonetheless, I was there for that.
[02:08:04.596 --> 02:08:09.999]  So, looking at this with your expertise then, give us your dead reckoning of what really happened.
[02:08:13.462 --> 02:08:24.508]  Well, I think, um, so I think, so what I'm hopeful for is, is some, um, some accountability at the individual, uh, officer or agent level.
[02:08:25.068 --> 02:08:30.731]  And to say, you know, you, you obviously had, um, observation of this.
[02:08:30.791 --> 02:08:32.732]  You obviously had reports of this.
[02:08:33.072 --> 02:08:42.317]  Who, who was telling you and why not to, um, engage, distract, uh, defeat the threat?
[02:08:42.970 --> 02:08:45.572]  That was apparent.
[02:08:45.773 --> 02:09:00.126]  So, you know, people that have maybe have recorded interactions with police officers saying, hey, I told this officer or hey, I told this agent, this agent here on video, if we can just extract from them.
[02:09:00.146 --> 02:09:05.491]  And again, of course, this is all going to work up the chain and find out who gave the stand on order.
[02:09:06.621 --> 02:09:29.548]  Yeah, because someone was telling them to, you know, oh this is a friendly guy, and then of course all the misinformation coming out of the agency is just discrediting and it's absolutely ridiculous where the director would say that the roof slope was an excess of what they were comfortable with and then it was too hot so the officer or the agent didn't show up at their appointed place in duty.
[02:09:30.188 --> 02:09:32.769]  That just simply doesn't happen at this level.
[02:09:34.702 --> 02:09:35.322]  Incredible.
[02:09:35.823 --> 02:09:38.344]  And so how do you see this politically playing out?
[02:09:38.384 --> 02:09:42.886]  Because the good news is Congress, the Republicans and even Democrats told her to resign.
[02:09:43.386 --> 02:09:44.506]  No one is buying this.
[02:09:47.108 --> 02:09:51.149]  Yeah, so politically, I mean, this is a whole minefield.
[02:09:51.269 --> 02:10:03.995]  And I don't, and honestly, Alex, I don't know where this is going to lead us other than just continued heightened vigilance on everyone who cares deeply for the country.
[02:10:04.828 --> 02:10:08.769]  Um, and, and, you know, I think that's what we need to look at.
[02:10:08.789 --> 02:10:19.153]  I know the previous caller, um, you know, was talking about, you know, uh, contracted security, and I think it briefs well.
[02:10:20.555 --> 02:10:24.056]  My fear of that is they don't have the same mechanisms for background checks.
[02:10:24.797 --> 02:10:27.718]  But, you know, there is, in the end, the good old boy system.
[02:10:27.998 --> 02:10:36.582]  And there is a lot to be said for that, for some of those tier one operators vouching for each other and rallying around the former president.
[02:10:37.582 --> 02:10:38.402]  And by the way, that's the key point.
[02:10:38.422 --> 02:10:45.068]   That's the key point about Robots and computers give criminals in government and corporations full of controller hackers.
[02:10:45.689 --> 02:10:49.892]  How do we get Trump at all these events with all this law enforcement and all these armed men?
[02:10:50.292 --> 02:10:51.133]  They're trusted.
[02:10:51.173 --> 02:10:52.313]  They've been proven.
[02:10:52.634 --> 02:10:53.934]  The human system works.
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:58.361]  And that's what we're talking about here is the human system.
[02:10:58.401 --> 02:11:01.761]  And now that system is under attack.
[02:11:02.161 --> 02:11:04.102]  And now that system realizes what's happening.
[02:11:04.142 --> 02:11:06.702]  So how do you get Trump around all these people with guns?
[02:11:07.062 --> 02:11:07.883]  Why do we trust them?
[02:11:07.903 --> 02:11:08.923]  Because we've vetted them.
[02:11:08.963 --> 02:11:09.823]  We know who they are.
[02:11:10.243 --> 02:11:11.043]  We've seen who they are.
[02:11:11.083 --> 02:11:12.103]  You bring in robots.
[02:11:12.643 --> 02:11:14.084]  It's a totally different scenario.
[02:11:16.484 --> 02:11:16.764]  It is.
[02:11:17.104 --> 02:11:17.424]  It is.
[02:11:17.504 --> 02:11:19.085]  And that's, uh, yes.
[02:11:19.485 --> 02:11:20.125]  Yes, it is.
[02:11:20.609 --> 02:11:29.275]  And really, you know, the robots are just, you know, all the autonomy in those systems are programmed by a person, right?
[02:11:29.355 --> 02:11:44.325]  So they program all the behaviors for those autonomous systems, and they're going to react as, you know, whether it's machine learning, it's learned behavior, or whether it's a set of plays, you know, a simple response to some type of stimulant.
[02:11:44.786 --> 02:11:53.585]   So it just What it comes down to is looking another man in the eye and trusting him.
[02:11:54.126 --> 02:12:04.811]  And I do think, as a Christian, that it probably doesn't hurt Trump that the old Lord and Savior seems to be in his corner, rightfully so.
[02:12:05.952 --> 02:12:09.433]  And that's got to freak the bad guys out, because if God be for us, we can be against us.
[02:12:09.814 --> 02:12:14.356]  In the day, the globalists can put their finger on the scale, God can crush the scales.
[02:12:16.238 --> 02:12:17.278]  I think so, Alex.
[02:12:17.999 --> 02:12:33.963]  And I'll tell you, when you step back and take the 30,000 foot view, you're talking about a basic trainee of any of the services or probably law enforcement at 150 yards would be expected to make that shot open sight, let alone with an optic.
[02:12:34.423 --> 02:12:39.004]  So, you know, this is just a divine intervention.
[02:12:39.942 --> 02:12:44.864]  And then you can wish it away and say it was a conservative false flag, or it was just sheer confidence.
[02:12:44.984 --> 02:12:45.825]  Yeah, speak to that.
[02:12:45.925 --> 02:12:50.747]  For people that don't know ballistics and guns, and I'm not a master, but I'm a lay person, a really good shooter.
[02:12:50.767 --> 02:12:53.528]  I mean, I grew up in Texas, but shooting since I was four years old.
[02:12:54.148 --> 02:12:56.509]  You don't graze somebody's ears.
[02:12:56.569 --> 02:12:58.070]  The best robot gun in the world.
[02:12:58.110 --> 02:13:02.792]  If Trump held perfectly still, and a computer had the perfect wind and everything, maybe it could do that.
[02:13:03.172 --> 02:13:06.514]  But we're talking one in a million with a computer to do that.
[02:13:06.574 --> 02:13:07.394]  That is not fake.
[02:13:08.809 --> 02:13:09.749]  No, of course not.
[02:13:09.829 --> 02:13:11.170]  I mean, yeah, no.
[02:13:11.650 --> 02:13:17.833]  Anyone who has any semblance of appreciation or understanding of target shooting would know that.
[02:13:18.413 --> 02:13:28.738]  That is an absolute impossibility, especially as the president was... And imagine Trump's in a meeting, we're gonna stage a false flag, and then at 450 feet you're gonna shoot me perfectly through the ear.
[02:13:28.758 --> 02:13:30.819]  I mean, that's ridiculous!
[02:13:30.839 --> 02:13:31.739]  Yeah, I think I'll pass.
[02:13:31.759 --> 02:13:33.180]  I think I'll step out of the race.
[02:13:33.260 --> 02:13:34.861]  You know what?
[02:13:34.901 --> 02:13:35.661]  Kamala can have it.
[02:13:36.704 --> 02:13:39.165]  You're going to shoot eight bullets at me, and they're all going to miss me.
[02:13:40.065 --> 02:13:40.305]  Wow.
[02:13:40.985 --> 02:13:46.826]  Yeah, and not everybody's familiar with ballistics and firearms, right?
[02:13:47.006 --> 02:13:47.766]  So I get that.
[02:13:48.266 --> 02:13:59.789]  But when you start to do all the other peripheral factors that go into play here, you know, the put options against the Trump shares, the draw of... Which is 100%.
[02:13:59.829 --> 02:14:00.869]  They tried to walk them back.
[02:14:01.169 --> 02:14:06.550]  And of course, it's super ADL, Southern Property Law Center, Soros Company.
[02:14:06.710 --> 02:14:13.415]  Yeah, and the CrowdStrike attack, according to the guests we had on the show the other day, the CrowdStrike attack could have erased any of the evidence around some of those things.
[02:14:13.435 --> 02:14:14.456]  Yeah, so we got him.
[02:14:14.556 --> 02:14:17.158]  So you're a smart guy, whoever you are, I can tell you for real.
[02:14:17.498 --> 02:14:18.659]  What is the enemy's next move?
[02:14:18.699 --> 02:14:19.320]  What should Trump do?
[02:14:19.340 --> 02:14:20.160]  Because Trump's watching.
[02:14:20.441 --> 02:14:21.621]  His people are watching right now.
[02:14:25.244 --> 02:14:30.568]  You know, I don't know, Alex, and I'll tell you... No, I know, I don't know either, but we've got to get our best assessment.
[02:14:31.029 --> 02:14:32.550]  What is your best assessment?
[02:14:33.731 --> 02:14:35.372]  Okay, so I worked...
[02:14:35.859 --> 02:14:37.840]  I worked for both administrations.
[02:14:39.140 --> 02:14:45.002]  So I bridged the gap for Trump administration and for Biden administration.
[02:14:45.102 --> 02:14:49.184]  And I don't want to say too much because, again, I'm just identifying myself.
[02:14:49.604 --> 02:15:00.388]  But I can tell you and I can tell the former president, President Trump, that he did not have a lot of front.
[02:15:00.788 --> 02:15:05.010]  OK, so we were there was information.
[02:15:05.580 --> 02:15:11.723]  That was withheld from his Security Council and from his White House Sit Room.
[02:15:12.504 --> 02:15:13.384]  And it was vetted.
[02:15:13.824 --> 02:15:19.888]  And maybe I thought, well, okay, maybe this is normal.
[02:15:20.588 --> 02:15:33.455]  And then when the other administration came in, it was open kimono and threatening calls from some of the staffers to get information, unvetted, direct.
[02:15:34.099 --> 02:15:36.180]  And, uh, you know, national security type stuff.
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:56.065]  And so, um, so, so, so my observation across two separate administrations is that Trump has to trust, must hire people that he can trust, like Flynn, like Giuliani, like, I mean, I mean, some of the key hard-hitting players.
[02:15:56.685 --> 02:15:59.006]  Yeah, people that have already been attacked and won't back down.
[02:16:00.806 --> 02:16:01.286]  Precisely.
[02:16:01.326 --> 02:16:03.207]  Tested, tested, tested men.
[02:16:04.369 --> 02:16:05.150]  Battle-tested.
[02:16:05.230 --> 02:16:05.991]  Battle-tested.
[02:16:06.031 --> 02:16:06.351]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:07.652 --> 02:16:08.073]  Keep going.
[02:16:10.996 --> 02:16:12.497]  That's about all I've got.
[02:16:12.517 --> 02:16:13.859]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:16:14.059 --> 02:16:15.200]  Obviously, they're desperate.
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:17.843]  They wanted to kill him because he's 20 points ahead in real polls.
[02:16:18.744 --> 02:16:21.947]  Now, obviously, they're going to try to kill him even more than ever, right?
[02:16:24.111 --> 02:16:25.172]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:16:27.453 --> 02:16:30.614]  So you're on the prayer list, as is Trump every night.
[02:16:31.274 --> 02:16:37.117]  I really would ask everyone to make sure that he's on the prayer list.
[02:16:37.177 --> 02:16:38.878]  I do worry for him.
[02:16:39.098 --> 02:16:39.318]  I do.
[02:16:39.338 --> 02:16:42.099]  All right, brother.
[02:16:42.119 --> 02:16:43.500]  Well, we hope you call back in again.
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:44.681]  We can tell you know what you're talking about.
[02:16:44.701 --> 02:16:45.721]  We really appreciate you.
[02:16:45.761 --> 02:16:46.361]  Thank you so much.
[02:16:47.022 --> 02:16:47.782]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:16:47.982 --> 02:16:49.403]  When you leave, you wish you would add something.
[02:16:49.423 --> 02:16:50.543]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:16:51.784 --> 02:16:52.064]  No, sir.
[02:16:52.772 --> 02:16:53.593]  No sir, I've said enough.
[02:16:53.633 --> 02:16:54.373]  I appreciate the time.
[02:16:54.674 --> 02:16:54.994]  Thank you.
[02:16:55.514 --> 02:16:57.095]  We get the best callers, the best everything.
[02:16:57.556 --> 02:16:59.477]  We gotta end the X-Spaces.
[02:16:59.497 --> 02:17:01.558]  We gotta end it all because we got a special guest coming in.
[02:17:03.140 --> 02:17:04.581]  But we're living in historic times, Chase.
[02:17:05.421 --> 02:17:10.144]  It's unbelievable and I can tell by just listening to that man that he could, that he was, he was legitimate.
[02:17:10.204 --> 02:17:16.009]  Using expressions like, it briefs well, but I mean, nobody says that even if they're trying to fake being somebody in a conversation.
[02:17:16.049 --> 02:17:17.830]  No, you know, you can't fake real.
[02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.470]  Yeah.
[02:17:19.031 --> 02:17:19.191]  Yeah.
[02:17:19.936 --> 02:17:22.977]  Unless it's the WWE apparently, right?
[02:17:22.977 --> 02:17:25.137]  Trump's so damn real, people.
[02:17:25.137 --> 02:17:27.537]  He's right in front of you, so am I.
[02:17:27.537 --> 02:17:29.936]  And these people just don't want to believe anything's real.
[02:17:29.936 --> 02:17:31.536]  There's a lot more good than evil.
[02:17:31.536 --> 02:17:32.036]  Yes.
[02:17:32.036 --> 02:17:33.336]  Just evil wants power.
[02:17:33.336 --> 02:17:33.936]  Yep.
[02:17:33.936 --> 02:17:34.736]  Even a small light.
[02:17:34.736 --> 02:17:36.335]  God almighty, I'm so real, folks.
[02:17:36.335 --> 02:17:37.336]  I love freedom.
[02:17:37.336 --> 02:17:38.736]  I'm willing to die for it.
[02:17:38.736 --> 02:17:40.336]  So these callers, I love to death.
[02:17:40.336 --> 02:17:42.336]  They call in, they get everything, some big setup.
[02:17:42.336 --> 02:17:44.136]  Evil ain't that powerful.
[02:17:44.136 --> 02:17:46.736]  Even a small light eradicates all darkness.
[02:17:46.907 --> 02:17:50.569]  Stop giving in to the evil's idea that it's in charge.
[02:17:50.910 --> 02:17:51.790]  God is in charge.
[02:17:52.871 --> 02:17:55.432]  It pisses me off people don't understand how much good there is in this country.
[02:17:55.772 --> 02:17:56.953]  But we don't have the high ground.
[02:17:57.313 --> 02:17:58.734]  But we're going to get control of the government.
[02:18:00.735 --> 02:18:01.836]  And I pray for our enemies.
[02:18:01.856 --> 02:18:02.876]  Yeah, I'm praying.
[02:18:02.896 --> 02:18:05.057]  Because I'm not a vengeful person, but it's got to be done.
[02:18:05.418 --> 02:18:06.498]  Yeah.
[02:18:06.538 --> 02:18:09.180]  You pray for the angel of death because some people did die recently.
[02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:11.381]  I was worried you started doing that.
[02:18:12.293 --> 02:18:13.433]  No, I talk to my pastors.
[02:18:13.453 --> 02:18:14.274]  That's Old Testament.
[02:18:14.354 --> 02:18:14.914]  I shouldn't do it.
[02:18:14.934 --> 02:18:15.714]  Shouldn't do it.
[02:18:16.955 --> 02:18:17.895]  But God, you know something?
[02:18:17.915 --> 02:18:20.796]  I've only prayed five or six times and asked for something.
[02:18:20.816 --> 02:18:22.597]  I just always prayed, God, tell me what to do.
[02:18:23.377 --> 02:18:25.258]  Every time I prayed, God gave it to me like that.
[02:18:25.498 --> 02:18:25.778]  Wow.
[02:18:26.659 --> 02:18:27.779]  And I told the story.
[02:18:27.799 --> 02:18:28.439]  People wouldn't believe it.
[02:18:28.519 --> 02:18:29.000]  It's real.
[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:30.180]  No, I don't.
[02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:31.160]  I don't take it for granted.
[02:18:31.181 --> 02:18:33.321]  It's not me, but I got a direct line to God.
[02:18:34.002 --> 02:18:35.142]  So does every other person, too, though.
[02:18:35.422 --> 02:18:36.062]  It's a big secret.
[02:18:36.803 --> 02:18:37.323]  We'll be right back.
[02:18:38.666 --> 02:18:44.729]  Whether it's the World Economic Forum, whether it's the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, whether it's Open Philanthropy and Dustin Moskowitz.
[02:18:44.789 --> 02:18:50.392]  We know that all of these organizations thought that they could bamboozle all of us.
[02:18:50.812 --> 02:18:55.555]  They thought that by putting fact-checkers on every post, we'd stop sharing posts.
[02:18:56.015 --> 02:18:59.917]  They thought by canceling people that we wouldn't actually listen to people's voices.
[02:19:00.037 --> 02:19:03.478]   But the bad news is for them, We continue to do it.
[02:19:03.878 --> 02:19:05.699]  So what are the simple things that you can do?
[02:19:06.039 --> 02:19:12.080]  The simple things you can do, like I said before, support the alternative platforms that are allowing these voices to be heard.
[02:19:12.401 --> 02:19:14.861]  Make sure that you actually have these conversations.
[02:19:15.021 --> 02:19:19.882]  Without the utility of this voice and this platform, we will lose the war.
[02:19:20.303 --> 02:19:21.663]  So our job is really simple.
[02:19:22.103 --> 02:19:22.643]  Share this.
[02:19:22.704 --> 02:19:23.464]  Communicate this.
[02:19:23.524 --> 02:19:25.305]  Support the InfoWar.
[02:19:25.706 --> 02:19:31.209]  Go to InfoWarStore.com for products to keep strong and prepared.
[02:19:31.489 --> 02:19:35.652]  Donate and share the videos at Band.Video.
[02:19:38.754 --> 02:19:39.595]  I'm just gonna say it.
[02:19:40.868 --> 02:19:47.116]  Are you aware, sir, that many Americans believe this was very likely not a lone shooter, but a coordinated assassination attempt?
[02:19:47.617 --> 02:19:49.779]  Have you been getting those messages from people like I have?
[02:19:50.180 --> 02:19:50.761]  I have not, sir.
[02:19:51.341 --> 02:19:51.682]  You haven't?
[02:19:51.862 --> 02:19:55.046]  Well, there's a lot of people in this room that have been getting the same messages.
[02:19:55.707 --> 02:19:56.808]  Why do you think that is?
[02:19:56.909 --> 02:19:59.691]   Why do you think that a lot of Americans are like, This doesn't add up.
[02:19:59.732 --> 02:20:01.012]  This doesn't make sense, guys.
[02:20:01.773 --> 02:20:03.894]  How could this many things have gone wrong?
[02:20:04.454 --> 02:20:04.654]  Right?
[02:20:04.694 --> 02:20:05.795]  Like the things I pointed out.
[02:20:05.815 --> 02:20:19.043]  A 20-year-old kid, 150, got 150 yards of the President of the United States with an AR-15, flew a drone to conduct site surveillance, was spotted with a rangefinder, ranging targets, then lost.
[02:20:19.863 --> 02:20:22.585]  Had advanced explosive devices on him.
[02:20:23.465 --> 02:20:29.970]  With no military training, nobody was placed in the most obvious spot to conduct counter-sniper operations.
[02:20:30.030 --> 02:20:32.091]  I was the sniper in the SEAL Team's kernel.
[02:20:33.292 --> 02:20:37.975]  As soon as I got out of the SUV and I saw that sniper, that water tower, I was like, that's exactly where I'd be.
[02:20:38.236 --> 02:20:38.996]  Put me right there.
[02:20:39.837 --> 02:20:40.457]  So obvious.
[02:20:40.997 --> 02:20:56.473]   After partisan attempts to bankrupt him, imprison him for 750 years, and countless depictions as a modern-day Hitler, are you surprised, sir, that a lot of Americans are like, Maybe there's more to this story?
[02:20:57.434 --> 02:21:00.076]  I wouldn't begin to speculate about what the American people think, sir.
[02:21:00.836 --> 02:21:04.299]  Colonel, did your team make entry and conduct investigation at the suspect's home?
[02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:07.321]  Prior to this shooting?
[02:21:09.703 --> 02:21:10.744]  Excuse me, sir?
[02:21:11.004 --> 02:21:14.546]  Did your team make entry and conduct any investigation at the suspect's home?
[02:21:15.546 --> 02:21:22.028]  I believe we had people that participated in that securing of it.
[02:21:22.408 --> 02:21:24.508]  There were bomb assets that we provided.
[02:21:24.668 --> 02:21:26.289]  Mr. Chairman, can I have 30 more seconds?
[02:21:26.829 --> 02:21:28.189]  Yeah, yeah, I'm letting everybody count.
[02:21:28.269 --> 02:21:28.489]  Okay.
[02:21:29.229 --> 02:21:35.531]  On the night of, since then, none... Did you get any reports from any of your agents of anything fishy at the home?
[02:21:37.952 --> 02:21:42.475]  I was briefed on- Was there any silverware found in the home or trash?
[02:21:43.076 --> 02:21:44.957]  I have nothing in the briefing that I was given.
[02:21:45.197 --> 02:21:47.799]  Was it extremely clean, almost like a medical lab?
[02:21:48.359 --> 02:21:49.380]  Were you given any of those reports?
[02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:50.841]  I was not given any of those details, sir.
[02:21:50.861 --> 02:21:51.842]  Okay, that's what I'm hearing.
[02:21:52.182 --> 02:21:52.662]  Interesting.
[02:21:56.145 --> 02:21:58.166]  They didn't kill Trump 11 days ago.
[02:22:00.177 --> 02:22:03.799]  Now they are in full, complete panic mode.
[02:22:03.939 --> 02:22:10.542]  They will try again and again and again, as our earlier guest said here on air.
[02:22:12.083 --> 02:22:15.185]  All right, I wanted to get here, fellow Texan, up here to Austin.
[02:22:16.578 --> 02:22:17.578]  From outside Houston.
[02:22:18.218 --> 02:22:20.959]  She's going to host the fourth hour today, but I wanted to get her on.
[02:22:20.999 --> 02:22:22.159]  Plus, she's a great sponsor.
[02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:29.961]  So before you know all the news, the analysis with Dr. Stella Emanuel, medical doctor, I just want to upfront plug her products because everybody needs them on the shelf.
[02:22:30.382 --> 02:22:31.442]  Plus, they support the broadcast.
[02:22:31.462 --> 02:22:32.802]  They're the very best out there.
[02:22:33.422 --> 02:22:36.603]  And whether it's prescriptions you can call, they've got those people can do all that.
[02:22:37.063 --> 02:22:39.224]  Or whether it is high quality supplements, they've got it.
[02:22:39.264 --> 02:22:42.505]  So you didn't come here to do this, but upfront, you're keeping the show on air.
[02:22:42.545 --> 02:22:43.765]  Plus, these are great products people need.
[02:22:45.333 --> 02:22:55.156]  Incredible products people need to buy from you, they need to support you, whether it's telemedicine or whether it's supplements, you've got it all at the website that everybody should visit right now.
[02:22:55.316 --> 02:22:57.557]  DrStellaMD.com.
[02:22:57.597 --> 02:22:59.477]  That's right, as in star.
[02:22:59.877 --> 02:23:03.158]  DrStellaMD.com.
[02:23:03.478 --> 02:23:04.979]  DrStellaMD.com.
[02:23:05.019 --> 02:23:06.319]  Promo code Alex for a discount.
[02:23:06.839 --> 02:23:13.581]   But you're keeping us on air, plus everybody should have this stuff of what's going on with the bird flu and all the Ready to go.
[02:23:13.942 --> 02:23:19.263]  So let's do a plug before we get into the news and Trump and the assassination and the Bible and everything that's happening.
[02:23:19.303 --> 02:23:23.265]  Let's do a plug because I've got to make you do this because you're a great sponsor up front.
[02:23:23.625 --> 02:23:31.848]  Tell us about the telemedicine that's one part of it and all the great things you've got for folks ready and then also the supplements and how they get to us.
[02:23:32.208 --> 02:23:35.450]  Yeah, with telemedicine, I keep, I say this everywhere I go.
[02:23:35.471 --> 02:23:36.972]  I've been saying this for the past four years.
[02:23:37.452 --> 02:23:40.935]  Everybody needs to have hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in their medicine cabinet.
[02:23:41.335 --> 02:23:43.476]  As I'm speaking, people call me all the time.
[02:23:43.797 --> 02:23:45.518]  Dr. Stella, come get me out of the hospital.
[02:23:45.598 --> 02:23:47.119]  Oh, Dr. Stella, I need ivermectin today.
[02:23:47.319 --> 02:23:48.500]  I mean, I get that call.
[02:23:48.560 --> 02:23:49.501]  I get those texts.
[02:23:49.561 --> 02:23:51.142]  I get the emails every day.
[02:23:51.202 --> 02:23:51.703]  I'm sick.
[02:23:52.043 --> 02:23:52.823]  My brother is sick.
[02:23:52.843 --> 02:23:53.604]  My uncle is sick.
[02:23:53.684 --> 02:23:54.825]  I need ivermectin right now.
[02:23:54.865 --> 02:23:56.486]  I need hydroxychloroquine right now.
[02:23:56.926 --> 02:23:58.588]  We cannot get it to you right now.
[02:23:58.888 --> 02:24:01.510]  So one of the things... And 100% the COVID and all that's back.
[02:24:01.710 --> 02:24:04.571]  Yes, we have the summer one called FLIRT.
[02:24:04.611 --> 02:24:05.811]  You can actually Google it, FLIRT.
[02:24:06.151 --> 02:24:07.372]  I mean, Biden just had COVID.
[02:24:07.392 --> 02:24:08.932]  Yeah, FLIRT hits Houston, where you're at.
[02:24:09.272 --> 02:24:11.013]  You told me a month ago, hey, we're seeing a lot of cases.
[02:24:11.033 --> 02:24:12.293]  Two weeks later, it was in the news.
[02:24:12.473 --> 02:24:14.774]  Yes, we're seeing cases right now, people that are getting sick.
[02:24:15.214 --> 02:24:19.375]  So, don't sit down and say... And by the way, viruses don't usually hit in the summer.
[02:24:19.415 --> 02:24:19.935]  Explain that.
[02:24:20.356 --> 02:24:23.657]  Record level in Houston and other Texas cities of FLIRT.
[02:24:23.917 --> 02:24:24.957]  This is obviously made up.
[02:24:25.197 --> 02:24:27.839]  Yes, viruses don't usually hit in the summer.
[02:24:27.879 --> 02:24:38.068]  Viruses, the flu and all those things, RSV, they're usually something that happens in the fall and in the winter, but somehow they have this virus coming in the summer, so they have this COVID strain called flood.
[02:24:38.589 --> 02:24:40.230]  And people are getting sick.
[02:24:40.250 --> 02:24:41.451]  We're seeing more sick patients.
[02:24:41.491 --> 02:24:45.635]  So I'm just telling you, the American people, don't wait till you get sick.
[02:24:45.675 --> 02:24:46.856]  Don't wait till you become desperate.
[02:24:46.876 --> 02:24:50.620]   Yeah, don't wait till the Bill Gates virus Yes, because it is better treated early.
[02:24:50.860 --> 02:24:58.088]  So that's why I've been screaming from the rooftop for the past, you know, four years, get hydroxychloroquine and avometin in your medicine cabinet.
[02:24:58.228 --> 02:25:01.532]  And you, day one, came out as one of the first doctors at press conferences in Congress.
[02:25:01.832 --> 02:25:02.593]  You've been vindicated.
[02:25:02.773 --> 02:25:03.815]  Yes, and guess what?
[02:25:04.275 --> 02:25:07.277]  You cannot call it into Walgreens, Walmart, whatever.
[02:25:07.297 --> 02:25:08.317]  They're not even going to fill it.
[02:25:08.877 --> 02:25:14.000]  It turned out, like you said, they paid $2 billion to Walgreens and to CVS to not fill it.
[02:25:14.020 --> 02:25:25.186]  Yes, so what we did years ago in 2021 when Delta was ravaging the nation, we got involved with mom-and-pop pharmacies all over the nation that will ship this medication to you.
[02:25:25.506 --> 02:25:28.868]   We have doctors all over the nation in all 50 And they did it on purpose.
[02:25:28.707 --> 02:25:33.506]   pharmacies in all 50 states that can give you hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin if you
[02:25:33.506 --> 02:25:39.066]   do a telemedicine appointment on our website drstellarmd.com, drstellarmd.com.
[02:25:39.066 --> 02:25:42.027]  I use promo code Alex so that you can get a discount.
[02:25:42.027 --> 02:25:44.226]  This is what I'm telling you right now.
[02:25:44.226 --> 02:25:48.266]   If you wait until you get sick and you're in the hospital, we cannot help you.
[02:25:48.266 --> 02:25:51.546]   Don't wait until your family, your children or something, don't do that.
[02:25:51.546 --> 02:25:52.546]  So please, right now.
[02:25:52.546 --> 02:25:53.546]  And they did it on purpose.
[02:25:53.546 --> 02:25:55.627]  They wanted people to help until they got really sick.
[02:25:55.627 --> 02:26:01.106]   Do you know Alex, two weeks ago there's an article that came out saying that the AG of
[02:26:01.106 --> 02:26:03.347]  New York wants to ban ivermectin.
[02:26:03.348 --> 02:26:04.009]  I saw that.
[02:26:04.069 --> 02:26:05.849]  Yes, so remember that.
[02:26:05.969 --> 02:26:08.370]  They don't want you to get ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.
[02:26:08.810 --> 02:26:10.851]  It doesn't just work only for COVID.
[02:26:10.931 --> 02:26:17.493]  You know, in the next segment, I'm going to be talking about some other viruses that are around, like dengue, like, you know, monkeypox, all those things.
[02:26:17.833 --> 02:26:22.894]  They are all sensitive to hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, and you need to have it in your medicine cabinet.
[02:26:22.914 --> 02:26:24.415]  So that's what I'm telling the American people.
[02:26:24.915 --> 02:26:35.319]  If you go on our website to a telemedicine appointment, we're going to take all your medical records, look at your prescriptions, look at everything that you're on, and they will prescribe it and the pharmacy will ship it to you.
[02:26:35.539 --> 02:26:37.679]  So it might take four or five days to get to you.
[02:26:37.959 --> 02:26:39.560]  What if you wait till you're sick?
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:40.640]  What if there's a survivor?
[02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:41.361]  And that's one arm.
[02:26:41.381 --> 02:26:45.662]  Then you've got the top, the best supplements out there, separately, you get right away.
[02:26:45.982 --> 02:26:48.223]  Yes, what if there's a cyber attack and you can't reach us?
[02:26:48.503 --> 02:26:52.145]  When you were on last week, you were shut down because of a cyber attack.
[02:26:52.205 --> 02:26:53.105]  Yes, I was shut down.
[02:26:53.125 --> 02:26:59.008]  I was supposed to actually be in Nigeria right now, but there was a cyber attack and all the airlines were shut down and I couldn't travel.
[02:26:59.988 --> 02:27:02.829]  I couldn't travel for almost four or five days.
[02:27:03.210 --> 02:27:07.672]  So this is something that is crazy and it's very important that people are prepared.
[02:27:07.752 --> 02:27:15.235]  And I say this because I deal with this all the time and my heart just breaks when people are really, really sick and they are really desperate and I can't help them.
[02:27:16.036 --> 02:27:16.877]  But explain what happened.
[02:27:16.917 --> 02:27:23.947]  They denied the first care, the treatment which has all been admitted in Concord, Congress, Studies, Hydroxychloroquine.
[02:27:23.967 --> 02:27:30.636]  I remember they block it because if you get it early you're fine, but if you get it late with the new viruses they admit Bill Gates cooked up, then you got a problem.
[02:27:30.916 --> 02:27:38.004]  If you go, there's a website called c19hcq.com.
[02:27:38.304 --> 02:27:42.889]  Now you will see studies or ivmc19.org.
[02:27:43.189 --> 02:27:47.814]  You will see hundreds and hundreds of studies that show that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin works.
[02:27:47.854 --> 02:27:48.695]  I'm going to show it later.
[02:27:49.016 --> 02:27:50.998]  But they've now admitted in federal court it works.
[02:27:51.038 --> 02:27:52.579]  They've now admitted they were wrong.
[02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:58.906]  The other thing that we want you to do is that we need you to get zinc into your system.
[02:27:58.946 --> 02:28:02.710]  I'm going to talk a little bit more about zinc and its effect on viruses later.
[02:28:03.391 --> 02:28:07.195]  You need to get zinc into your system, but zinc cannot enter the cell.
[02:28:07.255 --> 02:28:11.219]  So zinc needs an ionophore, or a zinc transport system.
[02:28:11.479 --> 02:28:14.202]  That's one of the ways that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin works.
[02:28:14.642 --> 02:28:21.545]  So to build your immunity or for immune support, I always tell people, get something that can carry zinc into your cell.
[02:28:21.825 --> 02:28:23.326]  That's why we have Covivite.
[02:28:23.406 --> 02:28:25.887]  Covivite has vitamin C, D, zinc and quercetin.
[02:28:26.327 --> 02:28:28.308]  Quercetin is a zinc ionophore.
[02:28:28.648 --> 02:28:33.230]  So if you get it and take it on a daily basis, you improve your chances of getting sick.
[02:28:33.470 --> 02:28:34.091]  Let's be clear.
[02:28:34.111 --> 02:28:35.411]  Since I said it, I want the crew to find out.
[02:28:35.431 --> 02:28:36.152]  I showed this one earlier.
[02:28:36.532 --> 02:28:37.593]  It came out two months ago.
[02:28:37.613 --> 02:28:42.536]  AP, Reuters, everywhere.
[02:28:42.857 --> 02:28:48.400]  Federal government paid CVS Walgreens not to prescribe ivermectin hydroxychloroquine.
[02:28:48.420 --> 02:28:53.984]  They paid them two billion dollars up front already knowing it was the answer to block it.
[02:28:54.265 --> 02:28:55.365]  That's why they wouldn't fulfill it.
[02:28:55.585 --> 02:28:56.186]  But you did.
[02:28:56.346 --> 02:28:57.707]  Think of the premeditated evil.
[02:28:57.887 --> 02:28:59.369]  Yes, it's great evil.
[02:28:59.789 --> 02:29:06.577]  And let me tell you something, you know, if they do some of these things so that doctors can just be terrified, like look at what the AG of New York is doing.
[02:29:06.657 --> 02:29:10.942]  They don't, see, they don't have jurisdiction over doctors prescribing medicines.
[02:29:11.502 --> 02:29:17.209]  Once a medication has been approved in this country, any doctor... Yeah, who made Latisha James our doctor?
[02:29:17.469 --> 02:29:22.811]  Anybody can use it off-label for anything, as long as you give the patient informed consent.
[02:29:23.271 --> 02:29:32.255]  But if they come out and say, we're going to ban doctors from prescribing hydroxychloroquine, it's just going to terrify a lot of doctors that are scared of their license and they're not bold, and they will stop doing it.
[02:29:32.395 --> 02:29:42.339]  Instead of fighting back and saying, you don't have jurisdiction over me, the CDC, the FDA, they don't have jurisdiction over me to tell me what I prescribe, once the medication has been approved.
[02:29:42.799 --> 02:29:51.405]  The second thing that we did that I want everybody, we put together what I call seven antibiotics you will need in an emergency because things are so crazy.
[02:29:51.765 --> 02:29:55.967]  If something happens, what would you do if you have a throat infection, chest infection, urine infection?
[02:29:56.308 --> 02:29:59.710]  So we put together a package, seven antibiotics you will need in an emergency.
[02:29:59.970 --> 02:30:06.074]  If you need to travel abroad, if you're locked down, so you can get that and be able to have this in your medicine cabinet.
[02:30:06.454 --> 02:30:07.214]  Not for you to use.
[02:30:07.314 --> 02:30:08.095]  This is a no-brainer.
[02:30:08.155 --> 02:30:09.976]  It supports the broadcast, but it's secondary.
[02:30:10.476 --> 02:30:11.856]  Everybody should stockpile this.
[02:30:11.977 --> 02:30:12.877]  It lasts for years.
[02:30:13.317 --> 02:30:14.198]  It's a win-win.
[02:30:14.258 --> 02:30:15.998]  And you've got the best prices ready to go.
[02:30:16.539 --> 02:30:18.940]  People need to keep us on air and get ready and have this.
[02:30:19.840 --> 02:30:21.481]  Let me tell you one thing else.
[02:30:21.521 --> 02:30:28.064]  There are people that got their Ivermectin stock up two years ago and they're sending us messages that, oh, it's expired.
[02:30:28.444 --> 02:30:29.784]  Don't worry about it.
[02:30:30.325 --> 02:30:38.236]   They did a study in the military and they found out that Medicines are usually good five to seven years after the expiration date on the bottle.
[02:30:38.697 --> 02:30:40.437]  So, do not throw away your medicines.
[02:30:40.518 --> 02:30:42.659]  Kind of keep it because, you know, keep your pills.
[02:30:42.699 --> 02:30:44.259]  I saw the studies.
[02:30:44.320 --> 02:30:47.941]  At first, they're maximum, but over like five years, maybe you lose 10% effect.
[02:30:48.001 --> 02:30:48.502]  It's still good.
[02:30:48.542 --> 02:30:49.342]  But it's still very good.
[02:30:49.402 --> 02:30:50.723]  So, don't throw away your medicines.
[02:30:51.123 --> 02:30:51.603]  It works.
[02:30:51.703 --> 02:30:54.385]  It's going to continue to work for years after the expiration date.
[02:30:54.805 --> 02:30:58.027]  So, I'm just telling the American people, please be prepared.
[02:30:58.587 --> 02:30:59.368]  Don't be scared.
[02:30:59.668 --> 02:31:02.570]  Don't wait till something... Well, they're back on the news saying bird flu.
[02:31:02.590 --> 02:31:04.011]  They're back on the news saying all this.
[02:31:04.412 --> 02:31:09.575]  Bird flu, Zika, dengue, there are all kinds of virus, especially with the border being open.
[02:31:09.916 --> 02:31:11.977]  Everything is coming in that America didn't used to have.
[02:31:12.278 --> 02:31:18.302]  Like right now in the Americas, they've had like almost 230% increase in what they call dengue fever.
[02:31:18.622 --> 02:31:20.003]  Dengue fever is caused by mosquitoes.
[02:31:20.063 --> 02:31:22.625]  It's not even supposed to be around here, you know what I'm saying?
[02:31:22.826 --> 02:31:24.307]  But people are getting dengue fever.
[02:31:25.336 --> 02:31:27.757]  Is that part of Bill Gates spraying billions of mosquitoes out?
[02:31:27.997 --> 02:31:28.597]  I think so.
[02:31:28.657 --> 02:31:36.118]  It's part of all the GMO mosquito things going on, and also part of the open borders with things just coming in, people not being screened properly.
[02:31:36.398 --> 02:31:38.479]  When we came into this country, we were screened.
[02:31:38.839 --> 02:31:41.299]  You had to go through all kinds of medical screening to come in.
[02:31:41.319 --> 02:31:45.800]  So if you can just jump through the border, you can bring diseases from every country.
[02:31:45.940 --> 02:31:55.063]   That is why countries have borders, so that diseases are not spread Both in animals, both in plants, both in... So things are just passing through because of our porous border.
[02:31:55.303 --> 02:31:58.124]  So that is why I'm telling the American people to be prepared.
[02:31:58.265 --> 02:31:58.905]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:31:59.365 --> 02:32:05.047]  Number one, get seven anti... If you're going to get three things from our website, get seven antibiotics you will need in an emergency.
[02:32:05.327 --> 02:32:16.112]  The second thing you need to get is the COVID Complete Pack, where you have vitamin... where you have hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, budesonide, Z-Pak, and a home-held nebulizer.
[02:32:16.152 --> 02:32:17.613]  I brought a... I brought that nebulizer.
[02:32:17.713 --> 02:32:18.073]  Look at this.
[02:32:18.900 --> 02:32:21.542]  Oh, and I had COVID and I was 48 when I got it.
[02:32:21.662 --> 02:32:22.143]  I'm tough.
[02:32:22.403 --> 02:32:23.604]  I get sick like every five years.
[02:32:24.024 --> 02:32:25.306]  This was like a gorilla on my chest.
[02:32:25.326 --> 02:32:30.910]  But people need to understand, with the collapse, and we hope we fix it, but everybody should stockpile antibiotics.
[02:32:30.930 --> 02:32:31.871]  You've got them at the lowest price.
[02:32:32.411 --> 02:32:32.892]  Everybody.
[02:32:32.912 --> 02:32:33.432]  It's a no-brainer.
[02:32:33.452 --> 02:32:34.333]  Yeah, we want to fund the show.
[02:32:34.373 --> 02:32:36.255]  Yes, we want to make money to stay on air and fight the globalists.
[02:32:36.615 --> 02:32:37.836]  So I'm selling stuff I believe in.
[02:32:37.856 --> 02:32:41.940]  I go out and say, what is the best thing to sell that I want, that I think is the best?
[02:32:42.060 --> 02:32:46.964]  And exactly in this crazy world, people should be stockpiling everything you've got right now.
[02:32:47.344 --> 02:32:47.804]  Look at this.
[02:32:48.145 --> 02:32:49.826]  This is the handheld nebulizer.
[02:32:49.846 --> 02:32:50.186]  Let me see it.
[02:32:50.246 --> 02:32:51.247]  What are you nebulizing here?
[02:32:51.647 --> 02:32:52.388]  It's a nebulizer.
[02:32:52.428 --> 02:32:53.349]  That's what you used to do.
[02:32:53.449 --> 02:32:54.269]  Is that water?
[02:32:54.309 --> 02:32:55.290]  I know that's just water in it.
[02:32:55.410 --> 02:32:56.451]  But that's what you used for.
[02:32:56.491 --> 02:32:58.833]  Yeah, it's water, Alex.
[02:32:58.893 --> 02:32:59.693]  It's not beautiful.
[02:32:59.934 --> 02:33:03.416]  No, but when I couldn't breathe, man, I got one of these and it was so good.
[02:33:03.496 --> 02:33:04.237]  Well, you know what's beautiful?
[02:33:04.257 --> 02:33:07.079]  The one I had plugged in the wall, though, like you said, even the power goes out, this works.
[02:33:07.239 --> 02:33:09.860]  Yes, this works because you can charge this with a power bank.
[02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:16.522]  You just have, you know, so it's a cute little home-held nebulizer that if you don't have power, if the grid goes down, you still have a nebulizer.
[02:33:16.542 --> 02:33:22.324]  By the way, when the Chicago was in full speed three years ago, two years ago, they were selling those for $1,000 apiece.
[02:33:22.504 --> 02:33:23.084]  This is so cute.
[02:33:23.564 --> 02:33:25.245]  This is part of our COVID complete pack.
[02:33:25.625 --> 02:33:26.105]  Isn't that cute?
[02:33:26.572 --> 02:33:30.831]   Well, let's accuse me to breathe. Yeah, okay good. So if you get the COVID complete pack
[02:33:30.831 --> 02:33:33.911]   It comes with a handheld nebulizer which you can charge with your
[02:33:33.911 --> 02:33:39.701]   The power bank because we give you the beauty tonight and everything so that that way it covers about everything that
[02:33:39.701 --> 02:33:42.942]   you need So that's what I'm saying American people. Just please
[02:33:42.942 --> 02:33:48.072]   listen to me. Don't wait till you get sick I get the calls all the time. He hurts my soul when that
[02:33:48.072 --> 02:33:52.409]   happens You don't need to die, you don't need to be scared of any of these viruses.
[02:33:52.829 --> 02:34:02.014]  Most of these viruses are sensitive to hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, with a supplement like Covivite, that can actually be able to cover a lot of the viruses that you're dealing with.
[02:34:02.334 --> 02:34:03.394]  So don't wait until you get sick.
[02:34:03.414 --> 02:34:06.636]  We're seeing... And for information, you've got that for steroids?
[02:34:08.877 --> 02:34:09.097]  Yes.
[02:34:09.578 --> 02:34:14.461]  So this is for the Budesonite, you know, it's part of the COVID and this thing is part of the COVID complete pack.
[02:34:14.781 --> 02:34:21.666]  So we'll give you Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, Budesonite, Z-Pak, you know something, and Covivite.
[02:34:22.187 --> 02:34:25.849]  So people go to DrStellaMD.com and what packs do they get to get all this at once?
[02:34:28.171 --> 02:34:29.632]  Yeah, they get the COVID complete pack.
[02:34:29.752 --> 02:34:34.957]  It has the nebulizer, it has the hydroxyl, it has everything you will need if you get COVID or if you get Zika.
[02:34:34.997 --> 02:34:36.699]  And you better get extra for your friends and family.
[02:34:36.759 --> 02:34:46.828]  I can't tell you three years ago, when I finally got the word and saved my dad and robbed a bunch of people, I bought dozens of these packs from you and medical doctors locally and we couldn't even get them at first.
[02:34:47.008 --> 02:34:47.248]  Yes.
[02:34:47.368 --> 02:34:49.150]  But it turned people around so quick.
[02:34:49.190 --> 02:34:50.471]  I mean, this is so obvious.
[02:34:50.799 --> 02:34:52.921]  I mean, it turns people around like in a day or two.
[02:34:53.181 --> 02:34:55.983]  Alex, I haven't had people sneeze on me, cough on me or whatever.
[02:34:56.243 --> 02:35:02.248]  When my family gets to get around to my house, I've not gotten sick because I take my supplements and I take weekly hydroxychloroquine.
[02:35:02.568 --> 02:35:05.250]  When we were growing up, they used to call it Sunday, Sunday medicine.
[02:35:05.650 --> 02:35:08.413]  So, you know, so I take Sunday, Sunday medicine.
[02:35:08.593 --> 02:35:11.375]  You know, some people take ivermectin, some people take hydroxychloroquine.
[02:35:11.415 --> 02:35:20.622]  So you grew up in Africa, tell people, and this was already done, and Africa had the lowest level of COVID and the lowest level of vaccine uptake because you said they take, they already take ivermectin.
[02:35:20.862 --> 02:35:25.583]  Yes, they take hydroxychloroquine and all these different chloroquines, camoquine, flavoquine.
[02:35:25.923 --> 02:35:30.344]  You know, COVID hit Africa the same time when it hit the whole world, but guess what?
[02:35:31.644 --> 02:35:35.945]  Sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest COVID death, the lowest vaccine uptake.
[02:35:35.985 --> 02:35:36.285]  Why?
[02:35:36.625 --> 02:35:40.966]  Because when people were going- It was like 3% even got it or something.
[02:35:41.006 --> 02:35:48.027]  Yes, and that 3% was actually in South Africa because in South Africa, hydroxychloroquine, camoquine is not over the counter.
[02:35:48.667 --> 02:35:52.049]  So if you... Even mainstream media asks, why is Africa immune?
[02:35:52.509 --> 02:35:53.590]  Because... Because you've already been through it.
[02:35:53.670 --> 02:35:55.531]  Because the medicine is over the counter.
[02:35:55.892 --> 02:36:00.254]  If you get, you see, signs of malaria, where you feel... So Africa already knows the drugs that work?
[02:36:00.574 --> 02:36:01.375]  No, no, it's not that.
[02:36:01.655 --> 02:36:07.619]  The thing is that when you have malaria, you get cough, runny nose, achy and everything, you just go over the counter and buy malaria medicine.
[02:36:08.019 --> 02:36:10.561]  So COVID has like the same symptoms like malaria.
[02:36:10.841 --> 02:36:17.485]  So when people got up and they cough and everything, they just went and bought malaria medicine and... So they already know because... Knocked out because... Why does it work for malaria and COVID?
[02:36:17.685 --> 02:36:22.268]  Because the same hydroxychloroquine that works for malaria also works for COVID.
[02:36:22.509 --> 02:36:24.070]  They were not trying to treat COVID.
[02:36:24.110 --> 02:36:25.511]  They just thought they had malaria.
[02:36:25.531 --> 02:36:26.551]  No, but I can show the headlines.
[02:36:26.571 --> 02:36:28.533]  Why is Africa immune from COVID?
[02:36:29.473 --> 02:36:32.075]  Scientists should know that, but I don't know what's wrong with people.
[02:36:32.195 --> 02:36:33.056]  Anyway, they don't want to know that.
[02:36:34.517 --> 02:36:40.599]  You cannot even social distance in the slums of Ajegunde or in Lagos, but people survive.
[02:36:40.779 --> 02:36:41.079]  Why?
[02:36:41.399 --> 02:36:46.041]  Because malaria medicine like camoquin, flavoquin, chloroquine, it is over-the-counter.
[02:36:46.281 --> 02:36:50.742]  So when people got achy and runny nose and fever, they just went over-the-counter.
[02:36:50.862 --> 02:36:51.342]  And it worked.
[02:36:51.502 --> 02:36:54.103]  And bought medicine for malaria, and it knocked out the COVID.
[02:36:54.323 --> 02:36:55.464]  They were not trying to treat COVID.
[02:36:55.524 --> 02:36:56.344]  No, it's a fact, guys.
[02:36:56.384 --> 02:36:58.185]  Try to pull the headline.
[02:36:58.585 --> 02:37:01.686]  Why is Africa immune to COVID, or Africa's lowest level of COVID?
[02:37:01.706 --> 02:37:02.306]  They admitted that.
[02:37:02.506 --> 02:37:03.387]  Yes, and guess what?
[02:37:04.027 --> 02:37:09.633]  Africa's COVID immunity is a medical mystery as mortality rates fall below early pandemic projections.
[02:37:09.773 --> 02:37:11.114]  It is not even a medical mystery.
[02:37:11.134 --> 02:37:11.855]  You're very stupid.
[02:37:12.775 --> 02:37:17.019]  You know the greatest number of deaths that happen in Africa in COVID was in South Africa.
[02:37:17.300 --> 02:37:21.544]  Because in South Africa they don't have malaria medicines over the counter because they don't have malaria.
[02:37:21.844 --> 02:37:26.228]  South Africa is not in the tropics, so they don't have malaria.
[02:37:26.868 --> 02:37:27.309]  Yes, he's right.
[02:37:27.549 --> 02:37:34.354]  So South Africa, the greatest number of COVID deaths, over 60% of the COVID deaths are happening in the whole of Africa, was in South Africa.
[02:37:34.674 --> 02:37:38.697]  But the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria is endemic, people did not die from COVID.
[02:37:38.717 --> 02:37:39.718]  They didn't take the vaccine.
[02:37:40.278 --> 02:37:41.760]  COVID was really not a big deal.
[02:37:42.040 --> 02:37:43.581]  But they destroyed economies.
[02:37:43.601 --> 02:37:44.742]  They locked down the place.
[02:37:45.202 --> 02:37:47.644]  They made people lose money, lose family.
[02:37:47.884 --> 02:37:51.387]  They locked up for something that did not even affect the nation.
[02:37:51.687 --> 02:37:53.729]  So scientists are saying it's a medical mystery.
[02:37:54.409 --> 02:37:54.929]  Come on!
[02:37:55.310 --> 02:37:55.490]  Ask!
[02:37:55.650 --> 02:37:56.610]  What is it there?
[02:37:56.890 --> 02:38:08.276]  If we've been talking about hydroxychloroquine and talking about ivermectin, which they use there, where they use there for like a dewormer, and you see that people in this region that have this thing over the counter are not having the disease.
[02:38:08.316 --> 02:38:20.403]  And the point is Bill Gates has paid for these synthetic viruses, he's gonna launch them again, and they know if you don't have the basic building blocks you're susceptible, but if you do, so what else do you do to protect yourself from the stuff they're cooking up?
[02:38:20.683 --> 02:38:24.604]  So I would say the first thing is get your hydroxychloroquine.
[02:38:24.644 --> 02:38:28.026]  Look, the pandemic appears to have spared Africa so far.
[02:38:28.106 --> 02:38:28.926]  Science Magazine.
[02:38:29.346 --> 02:38:30.927]  Scientists struggling to explain why.
[02:38:31.167 --> 02:38:34.088]  Come on, let me explain it to you guys that are struggling.
[02:38:34.568 --> 02:38:41.851]  Africa has malaria and they have the medications that we've been talking about over the counter.
[02:38:42.091 --> 02:38:42.491]  That's why.
[02:38:43.393 --> 02:38:45.635]  So it's no brainer.
[02:38:45.655 --> 02:38:49.417]  You were probably one of the first doctors to go public four years ago.
[02:38:49.577 --> 02:38:53.260]  Yeah, because when they say chloroquine, people are like, hydroxychloroquine, what if I'm pregnant?
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:53.980]  What if I'm a child?
[02:38:54.240 --> 02:39:01.105]  Hydroxychloroquine is so safe that people from babies all the way to 90s can take it.
[02:39:01.165 --> 02:39:03.206]  All it does is push zinc, right?
[02:39:03.326 --> 02:39:04.087]  No, no, no.
[02:39:04.447 --> 02:39:05.148]  It does push zinc.
[02:39:05.808 --> 02:39:11.577]  But it also stops viral replication, it stops viral uptake, it has anti-inflammatory, it has many other things.
[02:39:11.817 --> 02:39:15.002]  But it also is also an ionophore that opens zinc channels.
[02:39:15.779 --> 02:39:22.724]  So again, because you're going to come back and preach and cover news next hour, but you're a big sponsor, you help keep us on air, plus everybody needs us.
[02:39:23.024 --> 02:39:23.965]  I mean, it's a no-brainer for me.
[02:39:24.465 --> 02:39:27.647]  I promote a high-quality water filter at the lowest price, that's the highest rated.
[02:39:28.548 --> 02:39:32.490]  I promote stuff like turmeric, everybody knows that works.
[02:39:32.911 --> 02:39:35.312]  I sell stuff that's going to work for you, because that's how I operate.
[02:39:35.332 --> 02:39:36.833]  I want you to get a great response, come back.
[02:39:37.194 --> 02:39:41.256]  But you've got, whether it's prescriptions or whether it's supplements, some of the great stuff out there.
[02:39:41.377 --> 02:39:42.377]  How do they contact you?
[02:39:42.397 --> 02:39:42.958]  What do they call?
[02:39:42.998 --> 02:39:43.358]  What do they do?
[02:39:43.658 --> 02:39:48.921]  If you go on drstellarmd.com, drstellarmd.com, you make a telemedicine appointment.
[02:39:48.961 --> 02:39:50.402]  It's just like a doctor's appointment.
[02:39:50.422 --> 02:39:52.743]  You make a telemedicine appointment, you enter all your medical records.
[02:39:52.763 --> 02:39:53.344]  It is a doctor's appointment.
[02:39:53.564 --> 02:39:54.965]  Yes, it's a doctor's appointment.
[02:39:55.325 --> 02:39:58.146]  One of our nurses will call you, go through your records and everything.
[02:39:58.487 --> 02:40:08.592]  So when we finish, you know, our NPs and doctors, they will call you, the nurses will call you, they'll go through all your records and they will send your prescriptions to the pharmacy, and then the pharmacy will ship it to your house.
[02:40:08.833 --> 02:40:14.577]   So you bypass all these mainstream pharmacies that Don't want to take care of the American people.
[02:40:14.978 --> 02:40:16.019]  And that's the beautiful thing.
[02:40:16.059 --> 02:40:21.928]  When we're able to hook up our mom and pop pharmacies, I always give them kudos for being able to join me to take care of the American people.
[02:40:22.649 --> 02:40:24.231]  And Trump got a law passed allowing that.
[02:40:24.752 --> 02:40:25.273]  Something good he did.
[02:40:25.293 --> 02:40:26.094]  Yes, yes.
[02:40:26.895 --> 02:40:27.576]  And you know what?
[02:40:27.696 --> 02:40:28.998]  Till today, Alex...
[02:40:30.197 --> 02:40:36.263]  All these mainstream pharmacies will still not feel hydroxychloroquine, will still not feel ivermectin till today.
[02:40:36.283 --> 02:40:40.086]  Stockpile it now at DrStellaMD.com.
[02:40:40.166 --> 02:40:41.487]  Promo code Alex for a discount.
[02:40:41.568 --> 02:40:42.148]  Go there now.
[02:40:42.508 --> 02:40:43.289]  You're a great sponsor.
[02:40:43.369 --> 02:40:44.871]  And for all your family members.
[02:40:45.111 --> 02:40:45.891]  Shifting gears.
[02:40:46.572 --> 02:40:49.595]  What are you going to cover next hour and what do you make of Trump's survival of the assassination?
[02:40:51.032 --> 02:40:53.695]  I think that's a protection from the Lord.
[02:40:54.075 --> 02:40:56.117]  You know, when God calls people, He protects them.
[02:40:56.938 --> 02:40:59.720]  But this is what I want to tell people right now, everybody.
[02:41:00.781 --> 02:41:03.944]  People are kind of scared because they are thinking, well, they're going to try it again.
[02:41:03.964 --> 02:41:10.710]  I'm saying that we as Christians, we as the American people, it is up to us to protect Him spiritually.
[02:41:11.391 --> 02:41:16.175]  That assassination was prevented by, I'm telling you, it was an angel, that move he said.
[02:41:16.535 --> 02:41:21.899]  There is no other way, there is no other reason for him to be alive than what I call divine protection.
[02:41:22.179 --> 02:41:23.340]  So this is what I will say.
[02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:34.529]  You and I, we have the responsibility to continue to pray for divine protection over our president, over his family, and over everybody that is fighting this battle in the front line.
[02:41:34.869 --> 02:41:40.994]  You see, the Bible says in Isaiah 45 that our tongue is a pen of a ready writer.
[02:41:41.394 --> 02:41:44.695]  That means when we speak, it's like we're writing in the spirit.
[02:41:45.035 --> 02:41:47.976]  So, you and I, the power of life and death is in your tongue.
[02:41:48.016 --> 02:41:51.257]  So, instead of you being scared like, where are they going to assassinate him again?
[02:41:51.397 --> 02:41:54.498]  What you should be saying is that God is going to protect Trump.
[02:41:54.818 --> 02:41:56.198]  It's like the old injunction.
[02:41:56.218 --> 02:41:57.698]  The injunction's even said it before.
[02:41:58.139 --> 02:41:59.519]  So let it be written, so let it be done.
[02:41:59.599 --> 02:42:04.420]  Yeah, so we'll speak over his life, build a wall of protection around him.
[02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:09.681]  Join us, if you go on my Twitter handle, we have a prayer meeting every Sunday at 8 p.m.
[02:42:09.701 --> 02:42:11.301]  We've been doing it since February.
[02:42:11.602 --> 02:42:20.764]  We're praying for protection, we're praying for divine covering around him, around our election, we're praying for God to set Confucian in the camp of the enemy, and we are seeing it come to pass.
[02:42:21.124 --> 02:42:31.683]   So, do not be afraid, because you see, when you start getting fearful, you start speaking like things that can, you start speaking death into the
[02:42:31.683 --> 02:42:35.603]   situation but when you have faith and realize that God is still on
[02:42:35.603 --> 02:42:40.443]   the throne and when God calls people, he anoints them, he covers them,
[02:42:40.443 --> 02:42:44.163]   he protects them, but he... So you're saying if we pray for Trump
[02:42:44.163 --> 02:42:48.684]   the bullets will miss again? Yes, you need to pray for him, cover him
[02:42:48.984 --> 02:42:51.169]  Alex, how do you think I've survived all this while?
[02:42:51.489 --> 02:42:57.281]  I mean, doctors in my caliber, some have lost their license, some have lost their lives, some have lost... I have survived because I'm a prayer warrior.
[02:42:58.437 --> 02:43:00.538]  Because we pray for God's will to be done.
[02:43:00.558 --> 02:43:05.700]  The Bible says, in fact even the Lord's Prayer, Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:09.061]  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[02:43:09.581 --> 02:43:16.964]  God called this man and regardless of what you people think about it, if God did not call and anoint Trump, he would not be standing right now.
[02:43:17.324 --> 02:43:21.105]  Everything he has survived shows that it's a call, that it was a supernatural call.
[02:43:21.125 --> 02:43:21.585]  Everything fails.
[02:43:21.625 --> 02:43:22.865]  Everything he has survived, yes.
[02:43:22.945 --> 02:43:23.585]  Everything fails.
[02:43:23.605 --> 02:43:24.305]  Everything fails.
[02:43:24.325 --> 02:43:26.146]  Like an icebreaker, they can't stop him.
[02:43:26.406 --> 02:43:31.967]  From 2016 that he came out, it's like things just roll off him like pouring water on a duck's back.
[02:43:32.407 --> 02:43:37.048]  So you should know that there is a divine mandate upon his life and divine protection.
[02:43:37.428 --> 02:43:40.709]  Regardless of his own issues, he's not perfect, I'm not talking about that.
[02:43:41.189 --> 02:43:42.630]  But he's been chosen as the instrument.
[02:43:42.650 --> 02:43:46.472]  Yes, many people that got caught in the Bible were never perfect and they all had issues.
[02:43:46.832 --> 02:43:50.434]  You and I are not perfect, we all have issues, but it doesn't stop God from using us.
[02:43:50.835 --> 02:43:58.559]  So if God decided that I'm going to use this man for such a time as this, it is our duty to protect him, to pray over him and cover him.
[02:43:58.739 --> 02:43:59.520]  So that's what I'm saying.
[02:43:59.540 --> 02:44:02.321]  Alright, you're taking over in the fourth hour, then I want Troy in one hour.
[02:44:02.381 --> 02:44:04.082]  Dr. Stella takes over.
[02:44:04.122 --> 02:44:06.223]  Dr. Stella Emanuel, right now, stay with us.
[02:44:06.964 --> 02:44:19.309]   We've seen a lot of people And a lot of corporate media and a lot of pundits, and I see a lot, thousands of articles, the last month saying, Impo Wars will imminently be shut down.
[02:44:20.829 --> 02:44:27.571]  And they panicked with a federally appointed CRO and federally appointed U.S.
[02:44:27.611 --> 02:44:32.692]  trustee from the Justice Department, and five weeks ago, ordered this place shut without a court order.
[02:44:33.991 --> 02:44:37.734]  The judge excoriated them, fired them three weeks ago.
[02:44:37.754 --> 02:44:45.699]  Then two weeks ago, the Democrat Party lawyers that use the Sandy Hook parents as a front group came in and said, we want him shut down today.
[02:44:46.099 --> 02:44:47.340]  The judge shut that down.
[02:44:47.921 --> 02:44:51.643]  Then they tried to grab InfoWars a week and a half ago at the state court.
[02:44:51.723 --> 02:44:53.545]  The judge said, that's illegal and shut that down.
[02:44:53.785 --> 02:44:54.405]  This is epic.
[02:44:54.885 --> 02:44:56.286]  People say, how is this continuing on?
[02:44:56.326 --> 02:44:57.227]  Because we're fighting.
[02:44:57.807 --> 02:44:58.668]  We're not giving up.
[02:44:58.688 --> 02:44:59.409]  You're praying.
[02:45:00.109 --> 02:45:04.111]  But I love how five weeks ago, I told you this happened, and you're like, oh yeah, they came out in order to shut it down.
[02:45:04.711 --> 02:45:06.472]  You stood up to them, and all of a sudden, where's the video?
[02:45:06.672 --> 02:45:08.252]  You want on top of that video?
[02:45:08.592 --> 02:45:09.313]  Confronting people?
[02:45:09.673 --> 02:45:10.493]  This is serious.
[02:45:10.533 --> 02:45:11.434]  I tried to not escalate.
[02:45:12.514 --> 02:45:13.655]  Now it's all in the court record.
[02:45:13.875 --> 02:45:14.575]  Of course it's true.
[02:45:14.595 --> 02:45:15.675]  Of course I didn't make this up.
[02:45:15.715 --> 02:45:16.496]  I don't cry wolf.
[02:45:17.516 --> 02:45:24.219]  So, we are surrounded by wolves, but we've got God on our side, and we've got the people that love God supporting us.
[02:45:24.259 --> 02:45:29.361]  So, I need all of you to understand that we're still here for at least three months.
[02:45:30.540 --> 02:45:36.603]  But if people think we're not going to be here and don't support them, FullWorksStore.com, with great sales and great products, will shut down by extension.
[02:45:36.644 --> 02:45:37.264]  That's been happening.
[02:45:37.504 --> 02:45:38.525]  People aren't buying stuff.
[02:45:39.205 --> 02:45:41.106]  Even though we're selling all the products, it's gone away.
[02:45:41.126 --> 02:45:42.187]  Do they think we're about to be shut down?
[02:45:42.247 --> 02:45:42.387]  No.
[02:45:42.767 --> 02:45:43.908]  You order something, you get it.
[02:45:44.268 --> 02:45:51.572]  And so it'll be you that decides to shut us down if you don't go there and get X2 and X3 and Vitamineral Fusion about to sell it and all of it.
[02:45:52.012 --> 02:45:54.374]  But what I want to talk to you about is a fundraiser.
[02:45:55.054 --> 02:46:03.260]  We have a couple thousand copies of the number one worldwide bestseller, The Great Awakening, The Plan to Defeat the Globalists and Launch the Next Great Renaissance.
[02:46:03.820 --> 02:46:05.101]  Huge thick book I wrote.
[02:46:05.622 --> 02:46:07.003]  Just came out six, eight months ago.
[02:46:07.023 --> 02:46:10.826]  There are a few thousand signed copies left, and it is a fundraiser.
[02:46:11.346 --> 02:46:26.239]   I want to thank those of you that got a signed copy, but I want to encourage all of you that have not gotten a signed copy and you want a chance to support the broadcast and know that at the critical juncture you fought to get the funds in to keep operating because we're right on the edge of the red and the black.

[02:46:39.225 --> 02:46:43.187]  There's also about 700 copies of The Great Reset, the predecessor book to this.
[02:46:45.354 --> 02:46:48.835]  And unless we get a buyer and things change and, you know, whatever, we'll be shut down in a few months.
[02:46:48.895 --> 02:46:51.495]  But we will probably continue on.
[02:46:51.575 --> 02:46:52.616]  God's hand is on us.
[02:46:52.676 --> 02:46:53.496]  The force is with us.
[02:46:54.336 --> 02:46:55.536]  Please go now.

[02:47:10.239 --> 02:47:12.580]  I'm going to sign this right now.
[02:47:15.301 --> 02:47:20.902]  2024.

[02:47:25.663 --> 02:47:27.044]  Put a little something extra on there.
[02:47:29.244 --> 02:47:31.785]  All right, so I appreciate you.

[02:47:38.234 --> 02:47:46.561]  With myself, Alex Jones, Ken Heckenleiby, he'll put it together with a foreword by Stephen K. Bannon, who's a political prisoner right now in Connecticut, in jail.

[02:48:06.625 --> 02:48:14.273]  All right, so right now I'm actually hosting this next hour, and I'm going to talk about Bible, science, and current events.
[02:48:14.373 --> 02:48:19.418]  So I'm Dr. Stella Emmanuel, and host of the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:48:19.438 --> 02:48:21.880]  This is exciting, and guess what?
[02:48:23.201 --> 02:48:23.762]  Who am I?
[02:48:24.122 --> 02:48:25.523]  I am a woman of God.
[02:48:25.943 --> 02:48:33.748]  I always say that my greatest job is an intercessor for the nations, and then being a doctor and a businesswoman is kind of like my side hustle.
[02:48:34.208 --> 02:48:39.612]  So, you know, when I came out in 2020, everybody was like, how do you combine all this Christian stuff with science?
[02:48:39.972 --> 02:48:47.738]  I said, well, that's just who I am, because, you know, God saved my life and brought me to a situation like this and, you know, for such a time as this.
[02:48:48.238 --> 02:48:49.599]  So let's get into it.
[02:48:49.999 --> 02:48:57.125]   So one of the things that I want to talk about today is I believe that we're in a spiritual battle, and I'm sure that a lot of people know that.
[02:48:57.546 --> 02:49:09.037]  This spiritual battle that we're fighting, I believe that we're not just dealing with people that are demon-possessed, I actually believe that we're dealing with demonic entities in human form.
[02:49:09.638 --> 02:49:25.201]   And if we don't know that, we tend to just, you know, We tend to look at people and think that, you know, what they are doing is, or they are just making mistakes, but I believe we're dealing with demonic entities in human form.
[02:49:25.522 --> 02:49:37.310]   There are several scriptures that kind of talk about this, but I want you to play the video, the first video with Yuval Harari Noah, that has like a minute, and you see what he said about, you know, what we're going to be dealing with in this time.
[02:49:37.310 --> 02:49:41.110]   So I want you to see that and then I'm going to break what the Bible says about
[02:49:41.110 --> 02:49:45.409]   this, this entities that we're dealing with so that you know the battle that
[02:49:45.409 --> 02:49:48.909]   you're fighting and you're able to fight it strong and spiritual and know what
[02:49:48.909 --> 02:49:49.610]  we're standing for.
[02:49:49.610 --> 02:49:52.710]  So just let me let's get that video with Yuval Hararinoa.
[02:49:52.710 --> 02:49:53.411]  You're going to get it.
[02:49:53.411 --> 02:50:03.210]   So you have these dreams about a world without hierarchy without injustice
[02:50:03.210 --> 02:50:05.210]  without poverty.
[02:50:05.490 --> 02:50:12.337]  And which means, in effect, a world with completely different laws than the laws we recognize, that we are familiar with.
[02:50:12.757 --> 02:50:16.381]  And the idea is that there would be this magical moment, the revolution.
[02:50:17.162 --> 02:50:27.606]  ...of the crusade, or will rebuild the temple, or will create a new perfect utopian society, and it will be a moment of historical redemption.
[02:50:27.626 --> 02:50:35.869]  And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the sense of the Most High, and think to change times and laws.
[02:50:36.709 --> 02:50:41.791]  And they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.
[02:50:43.564 --> 02:50:47.313]  We have the fantasy that we can split off.
[02:50:49.189 --> 02:50:51.530]  Yeah, I think the future belongs to techno-religions.
[02:50:51.550 --> 02:51:02.497]  I mean, the big religions, the important religions of the 21st century are more likely to emerge from Silicon Valley than they are from the Middle East or from Afghanistan or Syria or any of these places.
[02:51:03.378 --> 02:51:08.201]  The main products will not be textiles and vehicles and things like that.
[02:51:08.641 --> 02:51:11.503]  They will be bodies and brains and minds.
[02:51:11.863 --> 02:51:17.187]  The main products of the 21st century are likely to be bodies and brains and minds.
[02:51:18.127 --> 02:51:25.491]  You don't have any answer in the Bible what to do when humans are no longer useful to the economy.
[02:51:26.052 --> 02:51:29.473]  You need completely new ideologies, completely new religions.
[02:51:30.174 --> 02:51:37.218]  And they are likely to emerge from Silicon Valley or from Bangalore and not from the Middle East.
[02:51:38.297 --> 02:51:43.841]  And they are likely to give people visions based on technology.
[02:51:44.441 --> 02:51:47.283]  Everything that the old religions promised.
[02:51:47.364 --> 02:51:50.806]  Happiness and justice and even eternal life.
[02:51:51.426 --> 02:51:54.649]  But here on earth with the help of technology.
[02:51:55.089 --> 02:51:58.972]  And not after death with the help of some supernatural being.
[02:51:59.949 --> 02:52:04.815]  Alright, I wanted you guys to watch that video because sometimes it's good to see what the people are saying.
[02:52:05.276 --> 02:52:43.098]   You know, in 2011, 2012, when we really started, that's kind of when God started really dealing with me with all the things that we're dealing with now and showed me that we're dealing with human demonic entities in human form and so that's what if you read in the book of Daniel Daniel chapter 2 verse 42 to 44 and you can open it and look at it what happened in this scripture Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon saw this vision and in this vision there was like a tall image that they had the head of gold breastplate of breastplate of silver gold silver
[02:52:44.432 --> 02:52:44.912]  All right!
[02:52:45.553 --> 02:52:55.138]  I just played a video with Yuval Harari Nomar telling us that what we're going to have in the 21st century is going to be bodies and minds and brains.
[02:52:55.657 --> 02:53:00.358]   So I want us to look at some things in the scripture and look at what other things
[02:53:00.358 --> 02:53:02.757]  that these demons are talking about.
[02:53:02.757 --> 02:53:08.737]   If you read in the book of Daniel chapter two, verse 42 to 43, this was talking about the fourth kingdom.
[02:53:08.737 --> 02:53:11.817]   And you also hear them talk about the fourth industrial revolution.
[02:53:11.817 --> 02:53:16.617]   It talks up in, it says here that, "And whereas as the toes of the feet were part iron
[02:53:16.617 --> 02:53:21.496]   and part clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken.
[02:53:21.496 --> 02:53:27.617]   And whereas that sawed iron mixed with mary clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men,
[02:53:27.617 --> 02:53:31.938]   but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay."
[02:53:32.377 --> 02:53:37.760]  And in the days of this king shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed.
[02:53:38.300 --> 02:53:44.823]  So what we're saying here that in this last kingdom, in this last days, we're going to have a mingling of seed.
[02:53:44.843 --> 02:53:47.265]   We're going to have Iron mixed with clay.
[02:53:47.545 --> 02:53:53.408]  Iron being, you know, AI, being defluents or whatever, and clay being human beings.
[02:53:53.568 --> 02:53:53.828]  Why?
[02:53:53.848 --> 02:53:56.930]  Because God created us humans out of clay.
[02:53:57.470 --> 02:54:04.194]  So, you hear Yuval Noah saying that in these last days they're going to be selling bodies and minds and everything.
[02:54:04.634 --> 02:54:08.797]  And you hear also, they talk about, you know, being able to download your brain.
[02:54:08.857 --> 02:54:19.866]   Elon Musk is producing what they call You know the neural link where they can download your brain and put in a body and if you die they can replace your body and then you can live forever.
[02:54:20.706 --> 02:54:25.148]  I'm just saying that we're dealing with serious demonic entities right now and people need to know that.
[02:54:25.628 --> 02:54:30.449]  If you read in the book of Revelation, in Revelation 13, I will read this, verse 14.
[02:54:30.949 --> 02:54:34.070]  It says that, and I think this is talking about cloning.
[02:54:34.770 --> 02:54:54.681]  Revelation 13 verse 14 to 15, it says this, And he deceived them that dwell on the earth by the means of the miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast, saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast, an image to the beast, an image to the beast.
[02:54:55.001 --> 02:54:57.503]  And I think image here is probably cloning.
[02:54:58.043 --> 02:55:00.885]  Which was wounded by the sword and did live.
[02:55:01.425 --> 02:55:06.006]  They say he has power to give breath, to give life onto the image of the beast.
[02:55:06.366 --> 02:55:11.967]  That the image of the beast would speak and cause as many as will not worship the image of the beast to be killed.
[02:55:12.468 --> 02:55:17.469]  So what they are saying here that the image of the beast, they will be able to create images.
[02:55:17.709 --> 02:55:19.069]  Why is this a deception?
[02:55:19.549 --> 02:55:23.050]  Okay, let's take for example like somebody like Bill Gates, if he's still human.
[02:55:23.630 --> 02:55:28.052]  Let's say that the devil comes to Bill Gates and say, Bill Gates, listen, you're going to live forever.
[02:55:28.152 --> 02:55:28.913]  You're not going to die.
[02:55:29.333 --> 02:55:39.158]  If you can just download your brain and put inside some Neuralink or some Optimus, and then if you die, we will clone you, produce your body, and then we'll put your brain back and you will live forever.
[02:55:39.658 --> 02:55:40.819]  That is the deception.
[02:55:41.019 --> 02:55:42.500]  Why do we call that a deception?
[02:55:42.860 --> 02:55:45.061]  He says that he would deceive them that dwell on the earth.
[02:55:45.401 --> 02:55:46.742]  Why do we call it a deception?
[02:55:46.802 --> 02:55:52.365]  Because the devil is deceiving these elites, telling them that they will live forever.
[02:55:52.745 --> 02:55:59.147]  Telling them that when they die, they will download their brains, then they will clone them and put their brains back in.
[02:55:59.747 --> 02:56:03.448]  And that is the big deception because yes, they will die.
[02:56:04.008 --> 02:56:05.688]  But when they die, they will go to hell.
[02:56:06.229 --> 02:56:07.549]  Yes, they will clone them.
[02:56:07.929 --> 02:56:12.570]  When they clone them, what is going to live inside of them is a demonic spirit.
[02:56:12.930 --> 02:56:21.414]   And that is why some of these people are so demonic, so crazy, because it is actually Demonic spirit in human form.
[02:56:22.335 --> 02:56:24.617]  Let's read that scripture again and put it together.
[02:56:25.077 --> 02:56:40.150]  You see, he deceives them that dwell on the earth by the means of the miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast, saying to them, Bill Gates, saying to them, Klaus Schwab, that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image, a clone, unto the beast.
[02:56:40.931 --> 02:56:43.093]  Which was wounded by the sword and did live.
[02:56:43.473 --> 02:56:44.313]  He had power.
[02:56:44.454 --> 02:56:49.337]  The devil has power to give breath, to give life to the image of the beast.
[02:56:49.737 --> 02:56:56.002]  That the image of the beast will be able to speak and will cause as many as will not worship the image of the beast to be killed.
[02:56:56.382 --> 02:56:57.683]  So I'm just saying this because...
[02:56:58.183 --> 02:57:10.893]  You know like during COVID we have this like really demonic high-ranking doctors that will just let people die and you're wondering how could a doctor that swore to protect life why are they allowing people to die?
[02:57:11.614 --> 02:57:17.515]   I would put it that some of the people at the top top of the echelon that was running these hospitals were
[02:57:17.515 --> 02:57:21.205]   probably what I would call the nephalums or what I will call this demonic
[02:57:21.205 --> 02:57:26.384]   spirits in human form and they are the ones that will insist and allow people to
[02:57:26.384 --> 02:57:30.425]   die. They are the ones that will insist and stop us from prescribing medicine that
[02:57:30.425 --> 02:57:33.984]   can keep people alive. They are the ones that will do crazy things
[02:57:33.984 --> 02:57:35.355]  that will hurt children.
[02:57:35.355 --> 02:57:39.955]   If you think about some of the crazy things that are happening in our time
[02:57:39.955 --> 02:57:46.875]   just imagine something as evil as putting masks on little two-year-olds
[02:57:46.875 --> 02:57:50.994]   in daycare while they are trying to pull it out of their mouth and just traumatizing
[02:57:50.994 --> 02:57:55.515]   these children or having a three-year-old come to daycare or a five-year-old and
[02:57:55.515 --> 02:57:58.755]   then they swab them and then if you get sick you have to go home and these
[02:57:58.755 --> 02:58:02.274]  children are scared that they are gonna die.
[02:58:00.590 --> 02:58:07.615]  The trauma over the nation, the trauma over the world, over our children was just too much, was something that was not humanly possible.
[02:58:08.095 --> 02:58:14.278]  Recently, of course, you will hear people like Dr. Fauci.
[02:58:14.619 --> 02:58:16.099]  I don't even think Dr. Fauci is human.
[02:58:16.460 --> 02:58:20.622]  If you just hear him talk, he sounds like what they call legions or something.
[02:58:21.342 --> 02:58:25.424]  So I would probably like to check his DNA or check his urine sample to make sure he's still human.
[02:58:25.705 --> 02:58:31.668]  Because the things that he's doing is so evil that human beings, a regular human being, I don't think can be that evil.
[02:58:32.248 --> 02:58:36.931]  So there are evil people living among us that are not human.
[02:58:37.631 --> 02:58:40.194]  These are demonic spirits in human form.
[02:58:40.734 --> 02:58:52.247]  That is why I said, if you look at it in the Bible, it talks about it in Daniel chapter 2 verse 22 to 44, that the last kingdom, there will be a mingling of seed.
[02:58:52.487 --> 02:58:54.589]  There will be clay mixed with iron.
[02:58:55.630 --> 02:58:56.751]  Why am I saying this?
[02:58:56.831 --> 02:58:58.352]  I'm not saying this to scare you.
[02:58:58.772 --> 02:59:03.535]  I'm saying this to show you that as a child of God, what we're dealing with is demonic.
[02:59:03.615 --> 02:59:07.178]  And at the mention of the name of Jesus, every demon bows.
[02:59:07.638 --> 02:59:19.506]  Not because... I'm not scared of those demons, but when you realize that what you're dealing with is not just human beings, then you start learning to use your authority as a child of God to challenge these demons.
[02:59:20.126 --> 02:59:36.053]  You know, in 2012, when the Lord really showed me this vision about these demons, we had done a 100-day prayer program, and we had just prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed, praying for the nation, praying for revival, praying for God to touch our nation.
[02:59:36.533 --> 02:59:39.154]  And on day 99, I had this crazy dream.
[02:59:39.714 --> 02:59:47.978]  I saw these people come into our compound, and you know, they were looking like buff and everything, you know, with dark glasses.
[02:59:48.598 --> 02:59:53.360]  And because I had been praying for 99 days, in the spirit I was like Rambo.
[02:59:53.681 --> 02:59:57.923]  So I was just beating them, punching them, throwing them around, knocking them around in the dream.
[02:59:58.123 --> 03:00:01.404]  And they stopped and told me that, listen, you cannot kill us.
[03:00:01.444 --> 03:00:03.205]  We're genetically modified human beings.
[03:00:03.685 --> 03:00:04.986]  It is not our time yet.
[03:00:05.026 --> 03:00:06.767]  When it's our time, we will manifest.
[03:00:07.367 --> 03:00:13.051]  And then, I had another dream later, when the Lord showed me, I could see people walking around.
[03:00:13.312 --> 03:00:15.193]  Some people were human, some people were not human.
[03:00:15.573 --> 03:00:19.676]  And the human beings did not realize that the other people that were walking around with them were not human.
[03:00:19.977 --> 03:00:25.301]  It's like, I would see a crowd of people, and the three or four people would be human, and the other ones would be, you know, demons and stuff.
[03:00:25.661 --> 03:00:28.123]  Or I would see people in hotels, swimming pools, swimming.
[03:00:28.503 --> 03:00:30.685]  Some of them would be mermaids, and some of them would be humans.
[03:00:31.145 --> 03:00:33.307]  And nobody seemed to think that it was crazy.
[03:00:33.907 --> 03:00:37.011]  So, and just about that time, the Lord showed me this.
[03:00:37.452 --> 03:00:39.034]  I just, I was like, God, what is this?
[03:00:39.354 --> 03:00:40.736]  That is when I started calling.
[03:00:40.776 --> 03:00:43.900]  I said, if I see something in the dream, I need to see it in scripture.
[03:00:44.280 --> 03:00:45.462]  So I started preaching about it.
[03:00:45.502 --> 03:00:48.045]  I started talking about it, that there are aliens among us.
[03:00:48.525 --> 03:00:49.407]  Everybody call me crazy.
[03:00:50.347 --> 03:00:54.631]  Now, I'm sure all of you believe that there are aliens among us because these people cannot be this evil.
[03:00:55.011 --> 03:00:56.592]  And now they're not hiding it anymore.
[03:00:56.992 --> 03:00:58.213]  It's out in the open.
[03:00:58.394 --> 03:01:01.056]  Yuval Noah is telling us that, you know, that they have bodies.
[03:01:01.096 --> 03:01:02.177]  They can download our brains.
[03:01:02.237 --> 03:01:03.037]  This is just normal.
[03:01:03.418 --> 03:01:04.879]  So right now, they're not hiding it anymore.
[03:01:05.399 --> 03:01:16.688]   Now, when I had that vision or that dream, I went online kind of looking at stuff and I found this movie and if you can pull up the clip of this movie called They Live.
[03:01:17.229 --> 03:01:22.133]  It's just like the short, you know, where there was this movie They Live by John Carpenter.
[03:01:22.553 --> 03:01:24.294]  It was a movie that was done way in the 80s.
[03:01:24.435 --> 03:01:28.158]  If you can pull up the clip, just play like maybe one minute clip of that.
[03:01:29.341 --> 03:01:36.506]  It was like, you could see people walking around and some of them had, you know, if you put on dark glasses, you could see the ones that are human and non-human.
[03:01:36.887 --> 03:01:39.949]  So when I saw that movie, I was like, oh my God, this is what I saw in my dream.
[03:01:39.969 --> 03:01:41.350]  This is what I've been seeing in my dream.
[03:01:41.670 --> 03:01:49.296]  So if you can pull that movie and just play it for us so that we can see it, so that people can realize that what we're dealing with is really, really demonic.
[03:01:49.536 --> 03:01:53.695]  and then you can understand your authority on how to fight.
[03:01:53.695 --> 03:01:58.635]  (airplane engine roaring)
[03:01:58.635 --> 03:02:02.135]  (airplane engine roaring)
[03:02:02.135 --> 03:02:05.636]  (airplane engine roaring)
[03:02:05.636 --> 03:02:09.136]  (airplane engine roaring)
[03:02:09.136 --> 03:02:12.636]  (airplane engine roaring)
[03:02:12.636 --> 03:02:16.136]  (airplane engine roaring)
[03:02:16.136 --> 03:02:19.636]  (airplane engine roaring)
[03:02:19.636 --> 03:02:23.136]  (airplane engine roaring)
[03:02:23.136 --> 03:02:34.056]  (whistle blowing)
[03:02:34.056 --> 03:02:37.475]  (airplane engine roaring)
[03:02:37.475 --> 03:02:45.316]  (whistle blowing)
[03:02:45.316 --> 03:02:48.816]  (airplane engine roaring)
[03:02:48.816 --> 03:02:51.156]  Okay, good.
[03:02:51.883 --> 03:02:52.744]  Okay, good.
[03:02:53.144 --> 03:02:55.144]  And how long is this segment?
[03:02:55.144 --> 03:03:17.704]   In this in this movie it was like this guy will put on dark glasses
[03:03:17.704 --> 03:03:18.704]  Thank you.
[03:03:18.762 --> 03:03:26.651]  Once he puts on dark glasses, he would be able to see what is beneath everything that we're looking at, like all the billboards and the magazines and everything.
[03:03:27.031 --> 03:03:29.234]  So on the surface, it would just look like a magazine.
[03:03:29.634 --> 03:03:38.740]  But subliminally, under it, it's like, obey, stay asleep, don't watch TV, reproduce, don't question authority, and stuff like that.
[03:03:39.341 --> 03:03:51.309]  And sometimes, I believe that these subliminal messages are really in everything that we do, and that has, that kind of, like, made people just kind of fall asleep, and not question authority.
[03:03:51.729 --> 03:03:59.294]  But thank God that, uh, thank God for President Trump, because when Trump got here in 2016, he kind of started challenging some of this stuff, and we woke up.
[03:03:59.995 --> 03:04:22.619]   So you can see he puts the glasses he takes off the glasses and it's a human being he puts the glasses back and it's a demon so I would call that discernment If you get discernment, and I'm sure that there are a lot of people that have had discernment of being able to, like, the Lord will show them in the spirit that, you know, they are discerning things that are not human.
[03:04:23.380 --> 03:04:25.841]  And I'm not saying this, like I said, to scare people.
[03:04:26.341 --> 03:04:32.184]  I'm just saying this to show you what we're really dealing with and also show you that we do have authority over it.
[03:04:32.604 --> 03:04:35.106]  We have authority over the works of the devil.
[03:04:35.926 --> 03:04:39.971]  So, at that time, these things told me that, you know, it is not our time yet.
[03:04:39.991 --> 03:04:41.612]  That when it's our time, we will manifest.
[03:04:42.033 --> 03:04:43.474]  That, you know, there are many of us around.
[03:04:43.714 --> 03:04:44.915]  When it's our time, we will manifest.
[03:04:45.836 --> 03:04:47.618]  So, I was like, you say, you can't kill me.
[03:04:48.119 --> 03:04:51.963]  So, I've always kind of been worried about the fact that this demon said I could not kill them.
[03:04:52.523 --> 03:04:55.005]  So I've been praying and saying, okay God, how do we handle this?
[03:04:55.386 --> 03:05:01.932]  Then I found out that whenever I would go through fasting and prayer and everything, I have challenged these demons in the spirit, you know what I'm saying?
[03:05:02.392 --> 03:05:05.054]  I would just blow them up in the name of Jesus!
[03:05:05.114 --> 03:05:06.756]  Holy Ghost fire, destroy them!
[03:05:07.036 --> 03:05:10.980]  And I would watch these Nephilim and I would watch these demons get blown up in the spirit!
[03:05:11.460 --> 03:05:17.164]  So I'm telling you as a Christian, as a child of God, that you have authority over the works of God's hands.
[03:05:17.344 --> 03:05:23.748]  And the reason why we're going through some of these things is because you and I have failed to establish that authority.
[03:05:24.208 --> 03:05:34.214]  So remember that in the name of Jesus, every knee bows, every demon bows, every Nephilim bows, every sickness bows, and stop speaking that authority.
[03:05:34.654 --> 03:06:08.797]   So if you understand the death of the demonic that we're dealing with, Also understand the level of your authority if you give your life to Jesus and as I'm saying this if you're listening to me And you've not made Jesus Christ the Lord of your life You can stop right now and just pray and just pray with me said Lord Jesus I know you died on the cross for me Lord Jesus come into my heart forgive me of all my sins cleanse me from all unrighteousness Become the Lord of my life and my personal Savior, you know clean me up and use me for your glory
[03:06:08.897 --> 03:06:12.503]  You can pray that prayer right now and Jesus will come into your heart.
[03:06:12.763 --> 03:06:17.110]  The Holy Spirit will come into your heart and you will gain back the authority that you lost.
[03:06:18.171 --> 03:06:19.111]  Why am I saying this?
[03:06:19.592 --> 03:06:21.973]  There are a lot of patriots that are fighting this battle.
[03:06:22.013 --> 03:06:27.355]  They know it's a spiritual battle, but they really cannot understand how to fight and be victorious.
[03:06:27.756 --> 03:06:35.279]  So if you know that you're fighting spiritual forces, you learn your authority, then you realize that God has given you and I power.
[03:06:35.519 --> 03:06:47.925]   The Bible says in Luke 10, 19, that we've been given authority over You know, to state up, we've been given power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and all the works of darkness and nothing should be able to hurt us.
[03:06:48.266 --> 03:06:56.490]  So I think in this segment, I really just want to restore every one of us back to the authority that Jesus got from us from the cross.
[03:06:56.830 --> 03:06:59.732]  And when you have that authority, then you can challenge these demons.
[03:07:00.052 --> 03:07:04.294]  If more Christians could just stand in their authority, these demons would bow.
[03:07:04.734 --> 03:07:21.492]  You know, and I'm glad that patriots are waking up, we're fighting, we're resisting, we're saying no, we will not comply, but I just want you to take it to the next level, where you're not just talking about we will not comply in the physical, you're talking also addressing the spiritual beings and saying no!
[03:07:22.153 --> 03:07:24.115]  The earth was given to the sons of man.
[03:07:24.355 --> 03:07:27.918]  The earth was not given to demons, not to Nephilim, not to fallen angels.
[03:07:28.058 --> 03:07:29.059]  It was given to us.
[03:07:29.439 --> 03:07:33.722]  And I will stand and establish my authority here on this earth.
[03:07:34.083 --> 03:07:36.084]  And no, you cannot take over my family.
[03:07:36.104 --> 03:07:37.345]  You cannot take over my city.
[03:07:37.545 --> 03:07:39.066]  You cannot take over my government.
[03:07:39.527 --> 03:07:40.588]  No, you cannot do it.
[03:07:40.788 --> 03:07:49.635]  And if more Christians, more human beings would stand in that level of authority, then we would even be able to push this darkness back.
[03:07:49.995 --> 03:07:52.698]  So that is kind of why I'm bringing this together.
[03:07:53.118 --> 03:07:54.980]  We're dealing with deep demonic forces.
[03:07:55.320 --> 03:07:56.782]  Everything in this world is spiritual.
[03:07:57.102 --> 03:07:59.124]  You're going to serve one power or another.
[03:07:59.404 --> 03:08:05.750]  If you want to rise up to high levels in the world, you're going to have to either serve the power of God or the power of the devil.
[03:08:06.171 --> 03:08:10.575]  And since a lot of us do not want to serve the devil, you cannot stand in the middle.
[03:08:11.056 --> 03:08:12.777]  You have to be intentional.
[03:08:13.772 --> 03:08:14.993]  You cannot just think it.
[03:08:15.313 --> 03:08:16.794]  You cannot just assume it.
[03:08:17.094 --> 03:08:21.397]  You have to be very intentional about your authority.
[03:08:21.658 --> 03:08:26.581]  You have to be very intentional about bringing the Kingdom of God right here on earth.
[03:08:26.861 --> 03:08:29.083]  So that's what I want to get across to you today.
[03:08:29.503 --> 03:08:31.184]  I know there are a lot of you listening to me.
[03:08:31.224 --> 03:08:33.105]  You know God has a hand upon your life.
[03:08:33.485 --> 03:08:35.246]  God has been calling you to work for Him.
[03:08:35.286 --> 03:08:43.170]  God has been calling you to do stuff and you've just kind of been lazing out there, maybe living in sin, living in iniquity, smoking, drinking and doing all this stuff.
[03:08:43.250 --> 03:08:47.232]  And because of that, you've given the devil the right to harass your life.
[03:08:47.773 --> 03:08:51.255]  You see, the Word of God says, if you break the hedge, the snake will bite.
[03:08:51.755 --> 03:08:59.460]   So if you're opening doors in your life, if you've If you're living in sin, if you're not obeying God, you're not reading the word of God, you're going to give room for the devil to harass you.
[03:08:59.860 --> 03:09:02.922]  But if you now stop and say, no, I'm a child of God.
[03:09:02.962 --> 03:09:03.463]  I'm a Christian.
[03:09:03.523 --> 03:09:04.563]  I walk in that authority.
[03:09:04.583 --> 03:09:06.405]  I always say it like this.
[03:09:07.005 --> 03:09:11.628]  Imagine that if you like, let's just take like the Iraq war.
[03:09:12.029 --> 03:09:23.677]  Imagine that during the time of the Iraq war, where there were insurgents everywhere, that you left here as an American soldier, you went to Iraq and instead of you hanging in the American team, you go and start hanging around with the insurgents.
[03:09:23.877 --> 03:09:24.679]  They're gonna kill you!
[03:09:25.039 --> 03:09:33.293]  So one of the reasons why a lot of us are suffering, a lot of patriots, a lot of Christians are suffering, is because we're still hanging out with the insurgents, which is the devil.
[03:09:33.814 --> 03:09:40.545]   Remember in the days of Moses, Moses left the court of Pharaoh and went to kill an Egyptian.
[03:09:40.965 --> 03:09:42.466]  Yes, it was a call upon his life.
[03:09:42.526 --> 03:09:43.126]  He felt it.
[03:09:43.406 --> 03:09:44.386]  So he went to do it.
[03:09:44.886 --> 03:09:46.987]  But he was still living in Pharaoh's court.
[03:09:47.367 --> 03:09:53.629]  So as long as you're still living in the devil's camp, when I mean by living in the devil's camp, that means you're still living in sin.
[03:09:53.649 --> 03:09:54.869]  You're still living in iniquity.
[03:09:55.109 --> 03:09:56.490]  You're still disobeying God.
[03:09:56.950 --> 03:10:00.731]  Once you're still doing that, then you start giving the devil right over your life.
[03:10:01.431 --> 03:10:08.555]  When human beings fall into sin and iniquity and do evil stuff, you give the devil rights to interfere with our world.
[03:10:08.895 --> 03:10:19.961]  But at the same token, when human beings decide to choose righteousness, to choose the Word of God, to choose to walk with the Holy Spirit, then we start giving God authority to intervene in our lives.
[03:10:20.321 --> 03:10:26.123]   The reason our world is so crazy It's because the prevailing priesthood is the priesthood of the devil.
[03:10:26.623 --> 03:10:32.364]  What I mean by the prevailing priesthood, you and I are the only ones that have been given authority over this earth.
[03:10:33.064 --> 03:10:37.005]  God will not interfere in the things of the world except a human being speaks.
[03:10:37.405 --> 03:10:41.026]  The devil will not interfere with the things of the world except a human being speaks.
[03:10:41.546 --> 03:10:50.508]  But what happens when the human beings that are supposed to be bringing this authority down are instead sinning and doing all kinds of stuff or just not speaking?
[03:10:50.968 --> 03:10:57.133]  You see, if you delegate your authority or you leave your authority without enforcing it, the devil is going to use it.
[03:10:57.533 --> 03:11:09.963]  So, my lesson for you today is that you need to wake up, read the Bible, read the Word of God, and start exercising your authority as a person that was given custody of our world.
[03:11:10.403 --> 03:11:13.505]  You and I have been given custody of our planet.
[03:11:14.326 --> 03:11:18.868]  In the spiritual realm, before anything happens in the physical, it is settled in the spirit.
[03:11:19.308 --> 03:11:29.073]  All of you that are scared that they're going to assassinate Trump, if they assassinate Trump, it is because you and I have not stood and spoken as people that are given authority.
[03:11:29.493 --> 03:11:34.716]   If you and I pray, if we cover him in the blood, if we surround him with fire, We command angels to protect him.
[03:11:34.996 --> 03:11:40.320]  The Bible says the angels of God, they encamp and run about those that fear God to deliver them.
[03:11:40.821 --> 03:11:43.683]  It's like being a minister of reconciliation.
[03:11:43.943 --> 03:11:47.526]  You hold on to God as an intercessor, and then you hold on to the person.
[03:11:47.846 --> 03:11:52.790]  And that is the same principle interceding for your family, for your children, for the nation, for anything.
[03:11:53.070 --> 03:11:56.472]  You have to stand in the gap and say, no, not on my watch, devil.
[03:11:56.853 --> 03:11:58.334]  And you cover the person in the spirit.
[03:11:59.304 --> 03:12:06.130]  And I'm just begging, pleading to all of you, join us on this Twitter space that we do every Sunday night at 8 p.m.
[03:12:06.530 --> 03:12:10.073]  If you follow me on Twitter, my Twitter handle is Stella underscore Emmanuel.
[03:12:10.333 --> 03:12:16.058]  We usually will post it where you can join us to pray for the nation, pray for the election, pray for President Trump.
[03:12:16.498 --> 03:12:19.921]  We are seeing the prayers that we've been praying since March.
[03:12:20.222 --> 03:12:21.763]  We are seeing it come to pass.
[03:12:22.243 --> 03:12:24.965]  And on a daily basis, learn to speak.
[03:12:25.666 --> 03:12:31.892]  The Bible says in, you know, in Psalm 45 verse 1, that our tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
[03:12:32.252 --> 03:12:35.455]  That means whatever we speak is written in the Spirit.
[03:12:35.815 --> 03:12:38.698]  And when we speak, it is written and then it comes to pass.
[03:12:39.198 --> 03:12:51.109]  So if you and I start speaking life, speaking protection, speaking peace over this nation, speaking revival, speaking thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven, then we have a fighting chance.
[03:12:51.469 --> 03:13:06.757]   So, My brothers and sisters, fellow human beings, and you know, men and women of God, and children of God, wake up, rise up, take authority, and be one of those that will stand and declare God's will in your life, in your family, in this nation.
[03:13:07.138 --> 03:13:09.499]  And when we declare God's will, it will come to pass.
[03:13:10.079 --> 03:13:11.480]  That way you will not be afraid.
[03:13:11.500 --> 03:13:13.661]  You're not going to be sitting around, well, they're going to do this to me.
[03:13:13.741 --> 03:13:13.881]  No!
[03:13:14.201 --> 03:13:14.901]  You speak it!
[03:13:15.402 --> 03:13:21.805]  Imagine if all of us on a daily basis just stop and take a minute or two and begin to speak revival over the nation.
[03:13:22.105 --> 03:13:24.827]  Begin to speak, say, Father, let your will be done in this nation.
[03:13:24.867 --> 03:13:26.267]  Let your will be done in the election.
[03:13:26.588 --> 03:13:28.849]  Begin to set confusion in the camp of the enemy.
[03:13:29.169 --> 03:13:33.051]  Begin to ask that God would arise and let our enemies scatter.
[03:13:33.651 --> 03:13:34.292]  And guess what?
[03:13:35.293 --> 03:13:37.314]  When you speak, use scripture.
[03:13:37.875 --> 03:13:43.057]  If you go to my website, my ministry website is called firepowerministry.org, firepowerministry.org.
[03:13:43.358 --> 03:13:51.442]  If you look on the sidebar, there are prayers on about every situation that you're dealing with, so that way if you need prayer, you just load up and you begin to pray.
[03:13:51.923 --> 03:13:59.267]  And, you know, there are people that don't understand how to pray yet, so we have the prayers written out for you with scriptures, you know, that you can just decree it.
[03:13:59.987 --> 03:14:24.200]  And then we have, you know, monthly programs that we do where we teach people how to pray, we teach people how to fast, we also do deliverance, we help you to break the power of the devil over your life, so that you and I can become people that are called in this time to stand and, you know, to stand in the gap and to become good custodians of this world that God has given to us and not allow these demons to take over.
[03:14:24.660 --> 03:14:25.942]  Anyway, I'm going to be coming back soon.
[03:14:26.422 --> 03:14:29.887]  Talk more about, like I said, Bible science and current events.
[03:14:30.508 --> 03:14:36.135]  We're going to be coming back, talk more about Bible, talk about science, talk about current events, talk about some of the diseases that are coming out.
[03:14:36.755 --> 03:14:37.396]  And you know what?
[03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:39.389]  See you soon.
[03:14:39.629 --> 03:14:42.989]  This is a real attempt to turn America and the world around.
[03:14:42.989 --> 03:14:44.909]  This is a real attempt to stop world war three.
[03:14:44.909 --> 03:14:48.308]   This is a real attempt to save civilization for our children, because
[03:14:48.308 --> 03:14:49.828]  there's not just evil in the world.
[03:14:49.828 --> 03:14:50.988]  There's good as well.
[03:14:50.988 --> 03:14:55.670]   And so you've got to decide that that's happening and join it and promote it and
[03:14:55.670 --> 03:14:59.709]   support Trump and support us and spread the word because that's what they fear
[03:14:59.709 --> 03:15:03.108]   is when you get a mission and you get committed and you take action.

[03:15:26.058 --> 03:15:27.978]  It cleans out your blood and flushes all the scrap out.
[03:15:28.198 --> 03:15:32.219]  Everybody needs the nano silver toothpastes and products at drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:15:32.438 --> 03:15:34.438]  This is a war!
[03:15:34.438 --> 03:15:36.438]  War!
[03:15:36.438 --> 03:15:38.438]  So, we're back.
[03:15:38.438 --> 03:15:42.438]  So, we're back.
[03:15:42.294 --> 03:16:01.773]   In the last segment, we're really just talking about the spiritual war that we're in, and I just want to pray for those that are listening to me that if you've been dealing with a lot of stuff in this past few days, in this past few months, people that are dealing with fear, people that are dealing with, you know, Just dealing with the attack of the enemy.
[03:16:01.833 --> 03:16:04.254]  I just want to pray right now in the name of Jesus.
[03:16:04.995 --> 03:16:08.877]  Lord, I pray right now in the name of Jesus to everyone listening to the sound of my voice.
[03:16:08.897 --> 03:16:13.459]  I pray that the healing balm of Gilead will begin to flow right now and begin to touch people.
[03:16:13.479 --> 03:16:18.562]  I pray that the veil will come off your eyes, that you see the glorious light of the gospel.
[03:16:19.142 --> 03:16:25.044]  Lord Jesus, I pray that the blood of Jesus will be released on behalf of everyone listening to my voice right now.
[03:16:25.444 --> 03:16:26.705]  In the name of Jesus.
[03:16:26.765 --> 03:16:29.425]  Lord, I come right now to the Holy of Holies.
[03:16:29.465 --> 03:16:31.866]  I come to the mercy seat through the blood of Jesus.
[03:16:32.226 --> 03:16:35.167]  And I begin to hold everyone listening right now.
[03:16:35.207 --> 03:16:36.488]  There's no distance in the Spirit.
[03:16:36.848 --> 03:16:39.869]  I take their hands and I bring them right now to the mercy seat.
[03:16:40.209 --> 03:16:43.370]  And I say, Father have mercy on them for every situation that they are dealing with.
[03:16:43.710 --> 03:16:48.232]  I pray for their families that the peace of God will reign in their families in the name of Jesus.
[03:16:48.552 --> 03:16:59.336]  If you're listening to me and you've been dealing with depression and oppression and anxiety, right now by the power of the Holy Ghost, I break that anxiety over your life in the name of Jesus.
[03:16:59.656 --> 03:17:04.438]  Let the peace of God just flood over you right now in the name of Jesus.
[03:17:04.918 --> 03:17:21.031]  I pray that the anointing that breaks the yoke, the fire of the Holy Ghost, the redemptive power in the blood of Jesus will flow right now, through this line, through my voice right now, and begin to touch you right in your home, in the name of Jesus.
[03:17:22.032 --> 03:17:24.814]  Holy Spirit, begin to heal hearts of people.
[03:17:24.834 --> 03:17:39.123]  There are people that are suffering, people that are hurting, people, oh God, that lost loved ones, people that have been taken down, families whose family members are locked up in jail because of J6 and all kinds of demonic stuff that these creatures have done.
[03:17:39.443 --> 03:17:45.307]  Father Lord, I just pray right now for your hand of comfort to be upon everyone listening to the sound of my voice.
[03:17:46.127 --> 03:17:50.771]  I pray Father that there will be a revival fire released over our nation again.
[03:17:51.091 --> 03:17:54.795]  There will be a revival fire released over the people of God in the name of Jesus.
[03:17:54.815 --> 03:17:55.675]  That you will wake up.
[03:17:56.176 --> 03:17:57.097]  Wake up the church.
[03:17:57.197 --> 03:17:57.957]  Wake them up.
[03:17:58.017 --> 03:18:00.479]  Take us out of the valley of dry bones again.
[03:18:00.780 --> 03:18:03.222]  That people will be able to serve you and know you.
[03:18:03.522 --> 03:18:05.924]  And America again will be a city on the hills.
[03:18:05.984 --> 03:18:06.905]  A city of light.
[03:18:07.366 --> 03:18:11.411]  A city that will take righteousness all over the nations in the name of Jesus.
[03:18:11.792 --> 03:18:13.975]  Father, I pray, O God, for our nation.
[03:18:14.035 --> 03:18:17.660]  I pray that, Father, in your mercy, you will not let this nation go down.
[03:18:17.921 --> 03:18:20.324]  That you will set Confucian in the camp of the enemy.
[03:18:20.604 --> 03:18:22.968]  That they will be exposed in the name of Jesus.
[03:18:23.408 --> 03:18:26.990]  I pray, O God, for President Trump, that your hand of protection will be upon him.
[03:18:27.350 --> 03:18:34.334]  Not only that, Father, that help him, Lord Jesus, counsel him, that he will put people around him that will do the right thing.
[03:18:34.454 --> 03:18:37.016]  People that will give him good counsel.
[03:18:37.436 --> 03:18:43.960]  In the name of Jesus, I pray, O God, that this election will be according to your will, according to the will of the American people.
[03:18:44.340 --> 03:18:52.704]   Father, begin to expose everything that they have done for cheating, crash their computers, Burn their system that they will not be able to cheat.
[03:18:53.044 --> 03:18:57.385]  Let the will of the people come to pass in the name of Jesus.
[03:18:57.805 --> 03:19:09.347]  Right now, I just pray, Father, for just for a veil, the veil that is upon this nation to be torn open that people's hearts will turn back to God again in the name of Jesus.
[03:19:09.847 --> 03:19:16.889]  And you know, I always, I like to sing, so I'm going to just sing this song for America, and then we're going to go into our next level.
[03:19:17.750 --> 03:19:20.637]  We cry over our nation.
[03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:24.727]  We cry over America.
[03:19:25.834 --> 03:19:32.080]  We cry over people that revive a come, come, come.
[03:19:32.760 --> 03:19:35.423]  Revive a come, come, come.
[03:19:36.363 --> 03:19:38.986]  Revive a come home.
[03:19:40.007 --> 03:19:42.809]  We cry over cities.
[03:19:43.590 --> 03:19:46.232]  We cry over families.
[03:19:47.033 --> 03:19:49.995]  We cry over this nation.
[03:19:50.055 --> 03:19:53.518]   Holy Spirit Rain, rain, rain.
[03:19:53.538 --> 03:19:57.140]  Holy Spirit rain, rain, rain.
[03:19:57.160 --> 03:20:00.903]  Holy Spirit rain, oh.
[03:20:01.904 --> 03:20:05.486]  Holy Spirit rain, oh.
[03:20:07.668 --> 03:20:13.797]  In our nation, Reno!
[03:20:13.877 --> 03:20:16.842]  Spirit, Reno!
[03:20:17.863 --> 03:20:20.567]  In America, come home!
[03:20:21.008 --> 03:20:23.011]  In our churches, come home!
[03:20:22.950 --> 03:20:35.129]  Come on. Holy Spirit. Come on.
[03:20:35.129 --> 03:20:44.270]   Rain, rain, rain, rain in our children. Rain, rain, rain, holy spirit rain. Father, I just pray that you will rain in
[03:20:44.270 --> 03:20:52.879]   the heart of our children that are being our children that are being programmed right now. All this demonic stuff that
[03:20:52.879 --> 03:20:55.529]  you would touch their hearts.
[03:20:55.761 --> 03:21:02.983]  There are many parents that are crying for their children that grew up in the church, children that were brought up in the right way and they've just gone astray.
[03:21:03.563 --> 03:21:09.424]  I pray that you would release the angels of the Living God, their ministering spirits set aside to help the heirs of salvation.
[03:21:09.864 --> 03:21:15.366]  That you release them right now to go forth and begin to bring our children back in the name of Jesus.
[03:21:15.866 --> 03:21:22.549]  And if you're listening to me, you have family, you have children, just begin to call their name and just cry out for mercy.
[03:21:22.589 --> 03:21:31.372]  Say, God's mercy will come upon your children and the Spirit of God will go forth and bring your children back from wherever the enemy has caged them, in the name of Jesus.
[03:21:31.732 --> 03:21:35.674]  That God will just begin to touch us again, in the name of Jesus.
[03:21:36.764 --> 03:21:37.545]  In Jesus' name.
[03:21:38.145 --> 03:21:41.448]  Anyway, thank you for that, my preaching.
[03:21:42.789 --> 03:21:47.332]  And I want us to kind of look about a few other things that are happening.
[03:21:47.352 --> 03:21:51.135]  Like I said, my segment is Bible Science and Current Events.
[03:21:51.836 --> 03:21:57.960]  There are many things that are happening in our time right now that I do believe that it was written in the Bible.
[03:21:58.561 --> 03:22:16.076]   In the book of Revelation, Revelation chapter 13, Verse 16 to 18 says, He causes all, both small, great, rich, poor, free, bond, to receive a mark on their right hand or in their foreheads, that no man will be able to buy or sell, save he that has the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
[03:22:16.756 --> 03:22:22.598]  So, right now, and here's the wisdom, let him that have understanding count the number of the beast, for it's the number of man.
[03:22:22.898 --> 03:22:23.798]  His number is 603 score and 6.
[03:22:25.479 --> 03:22:32.402]  Right now, the Word of God is telling us here that there's going to come a time that you're not going to be able to buy or sell except you get a mark.
[03:22:33.303 --> 03:22:49.870]  If you pick up your phone right now and you just Google digital ID, just put any nation, Cameroon, Nigeria, Congo, Mexico, America, Canada, just any nation, you will see that all nations right now are at a very advanced level in their digital ID.
[03:22:50.885 --> 03:22:56.110]  We're hearing about the digital currency, central bank digital currency.
[03:22:56.610 --> 03:22:59.312]  There's going to come a time where you're not going to be able to buy or sell without it.
[03:22:59.653 --> 03:23:02.775]  And there are a lot of things that are happening right now moving towards this.
[03:23:03.136 --> 03:23:07.279]  If you Google, Bill Gates did something called the Quantum Dot Tattoo.
[03:23:07.659 --> 03:23:15.146]  The Quantum Dot Tattoo is supposed to be something that you can inject under your skin that can carry your vaccine record, it can carry your bank record, it can carry everything.
[03:23:15.606 --> 03:23:17.288]  So they have this ready already.
[03:23:17.328 --> 03:23:18.048]  It's called the Quant.
[03:23:18.989 --> 03:23:22.892]  And how are they going to get people to accept this digital ID?
[03:23:23.373 --> 03:23:24.794]  It's going to come with disruption.
[03:23:25.574 --> 03:23:36.042]  So all the crazy stuff that is happening right now, they are getting ready for disruptive events, just like they disrupted us during COVID and many people took the vaccine.
[03:23:36.462 --> 03:23:45.910]  It's just that unfortunately for them, God had his mercy and just came and, you know, and we stood that day in front of the Supreme Court and we screamed and people started shouting like, no, you cannot take us down.
[03:23:46.470 --> 03:23:47.271]  But remember that.
[03:23:48.573 --> 03:23:57.603]  Right now, these demons, I call them demons because World Economic Forum, Bill Gates, you know, WHO, Tedros, all of them, you know, they're not going to give up.
[03:23:57.823 --> 03:24:01.727]  They are still going to try to put disruptive events and the disruption is coming through vaccines.
[03:24:02.728 --> 03:24:04.250]  They're going to try to bring diseases.
[03:24:04.510 --> 03:24:08.714]  Right now in America, if you Google it, you're going to see something called dengue fever.
[03:24:09.415 --> 03:24:12.096]  Dengue fever is not even a disease that is supposed to be in America.
[03:24:12.456 --> 03:24:14.316]  It's supposed to be like, well.
[03:24:14.816 --> 03:24:19.617]  So right now they said there's an increase in dengue, over 230% increase in dengue.
[03:24:19.657 --> 03:24:23.438]  Dengue is a virus transmitted by the Aedes mosquito.
[03:24:23.798 --> 03:24:27.039]  It is not supposed to be endemic in America, but dengue is coming around.
[03:24:27.499 --> 03:24:29.459]  Zika, you know, we have bird flu.
[03:24:29.519 --> 03:24:33.020]  If you Google bird flu, I believe that they are actually planning bird flu.
[03:24:33.060 --> 03:24:36.001]  We have the bird flu conference that they are planning already in October.
[03:24:37.041 --> 03:24:38.343]  About three weeks to the election.
[03:24:38.784 --> 03:24:40.486]  They are planning the Bird Fruit Conference.
[03:24:40.526 --> 03:24:43.109]  They are making sure that they can be able to lock us down.
[03:24:43.530 --> 03:24:46.454]  They already have it arranged just the way that they did with the...
[03:24:47.567 --> 03:24:50.787]  they did with the, what do you call it, with Event 201.
[03:24:50.787 --> 03:24:53.147]  So they already have their event arranged.
[03:24:53.147 --> 03:24:55.507]  They are monitoring our sewer system right now.
[03:24:55.507 --> 03:24:59.867]   And if they start monitoring our sewer for bird flu, that means at any time they can just declare
[03:24:59.867 --> 03:25:04.227]   bird flu pandemic and then lock down cities because they found bird flu in the sewer.
[03:25:04.227 --> 03:25:10.147]   They started with chicken just like, I feel like we are at the cusp of what happened in 2020.
[03:25:10.147 --> 03:25:15.106]   Just like when they started in Wuhan, initially it was in a bat and then somebody ate bat soup
[03:25:15.106 --> 03:25:18.027]  and then from bat soup it went to human beans.
[03:25:18.027 --> 03:25:22.826]   And then very soon there was the first patient in Seattle, Washington, and two, three months later
[03:25:22.826 --> 03:25:23.746]  we're in lockdown.
[03:25:24.082 --> 03:25:26.103]  I believe that they are creating these disruptive events.
[03:25:26.803 --> 03:25:28.604]  So, bird flu, they are planning it.
[03:25:28.684 --> 03:25:33.566]  We have the COVID virus, too, that is already around, the fleet version.
[03:25:34.126 --> 03:25:37.268]  And then, of course, we have things like dengue, we have Zika.
[03:25:37.288 --> 03:25:39.129]  So they just have a whole bunch of stuff that they are planning.
[03:25:39.729 --> 03:25:41.770]  And not just in America, kind of all over the world.
[03:25:42.816 --> 03:25:45.278]  The other thing that they are doing is disrupting our food supply.
[03:25:45.298 --> 03:25:46.639]  So think about it with bird flu.
[03:25:47.119 --> 03:25:48.660]  They are killing chickens all over the country.
[03:25:48.680 --> 03:25:50.762]  They are killing chickens in Colorado, in Michigan.
[03:25:50.782 --> 03:25:52.943]  They are really just slaughtering and killing chickens.
[03:25:53.464 --> 03:25:57.226]  And very soon they are going to kill our cows because the cows also carry bird flu.
[03:25:57.607 --> 03:26:01.249]  Not only do they carry bird flu but the cows fart and cause global warming.
[03:26:01.749 --> 03:26:03.551]  So they are going to be disrupting our food supply.
[03:26:04.051 --> 03:26:18.723]  Not just here, if you see like in Africa, they've put fertilizers right now in so many countries, they are bringing GMO corn, and so that the land is getting destroyed, and the land cannot just produce food by itself anymore without some fertilizer or some GMO stuff.
[03:26:19.164 --> 03:26:26.750]  So they are coming against our food supply, they are bringing all kinds of viruses and everything, infections, because they know human beings are scared to die.
[03:26:27.111 --> 03:26:30.814]  So if they bring an infection, human beings will take any kind of digital ID they give them.
[03:26:31.354 --> 03:26:34.295]  And then, of course, they're going to have cyber attacks.
[03:26:35.015 --> 03:26:36.896]  I was actually supposed to be in Nigeria right now.
[03:26:36.916 --> 03:26:41.417]  I was preaching in a conference in Nigeria, and the day I was going to leave, I packed my bags on the way out.
[03:26:41.457 --> 03:26:44.618]  They said Delta crashed, and nobody could leave the country.
[03:26:44.658 --> 03:26:46.559]  Nobody, there were people staying at the airport for 48 hours.
[03:26:47.819 --> 03:26:49.160]  We could not go to the bank.
[03:26:49.600 --> 03:26:50.881]  This happened on Friday.
[03:26:51.521 --> 03:26:55.903]  It's just that people are not talking about it because, you know, everybody's distracted with Harris, Harris, Harris.
[03:26:55.923 --> 03:26:56.764]  People are distracted.
[03:26:57.064 --> 03:27:01.366]  But for like two, three days, four days, Delta has still not gotten together.
[03:27:01.707 --> 03:27:06.269]  In fact, the only airline that did not go down was Southwest because, of course, their computers are old.
[03:27:06.809 --> 03:27:10.091]  But Delta, United, you could not even leave the country.
[03:27:10.331 --> 03:27:11.492]  People were stuck at the airport.
[03:27:11.852 --> 03:27:14.113]  I could not travel to go preach like I had to go.
[03:27:14.153 --> 03:27:14.634]  I'm still here.
[03:27:15.314 --> 03:27:15.654]  Why?
[03:27:16.295 --> 03:27:24.920]  They said CloudStrike, which is a Microsoft software, had an upgrade and because of the upgrade, you know, everything went down.
[03:27:25.993 --> 03:27:28.915]  So imagine what will happen if there's a cyber attack.
[03:27:28.996 --> 03:27:38.624]  Klaus Schwab already said it, that there will be a major cyber attack and that this when they bring that cyber attack, you know, COVID will look like child's play.
[03:27:39.104 --> 03:27:49.312]   So if imagine there's a cyber attack and then you cannot reach your computer, it brings down our, you know, you know, there's no There's no light or anything.
[03:27:49.572 --> 03:27:50.472]  We are in Texas.
[03:27:50.572 --> 03:27:54.574]  We know Hurricane Barry passed through, and for like a week, many people did not have electricity.
[03:27:54.954 --> 03:27:56.695]  Our grid is not strong like that.
[03:27:57.075 --> 03:27:59.317]  So, we're looking at disruption in that level.
[03:27:59.877 --> 03:28:02.938]  And then, of course, you can look at disruption in the markets.
[03:28:03.358 --> 03:28:07.981]  The BRICS nations are gathering together, ready to disrupt the system, ready to drop the dollar.
[03:28:08.341 --> 03:28:10.602]  China is already dropping a lot of our treasury bonds.
[03:28:11.082 --> 03:28:16.405]  So, we are basically just standing on tether hooks, waiting for these globalists to do their best.
[03:28:17.489 --> 03:28:20.974]  And, uh, for somebody like me, I'm not scared, you know, and you shouldn't be.
[03:28:20.994 --> 03:28:24.819]  I think that every one of us need to get paranoid.
[03:28:24.960 --> 03:28:27.363]  Like, totally, completely paranoid, so that we're prepared.
[03:28:28.024 --> 03:28:29.786]  If you're paranoid, you will be prepared.
[03:28:30.825 --> 03:28:31.986]  Be prepared physically.
[03:28:32.026 --> 03:28:33.466]  Stock up food, stock up water.
[03:28:34.067 --> 03:28:38.349]  You know, charcoal grill, water filtration system.
[03:28:38.709 --> 03:28:44.272]  Just make sure that you are totally prepared that if something happens, you and your family can survive.
[03:28:44.812 --> 03:28:47.053]  Make sure that you start growing your own food.
[03:28:47.073 --> 03:28:54.857]   You can grow potatoes in In baskets or, you know, in flower pots.
[03:28:54.897 --> 03:28:56.057]  You can grow your own potatoes.
[03:28:56.077 --> 03:28:56.837]  You can grow food.
[03:28:56.877 --> 03:28:57.818]  You can grow watermelon.
[03:28:58.238 --> 03:28:59.418]  Start growing your own food.
[03:28:59.458 --> 03:29:01.179]  You don't learn urban farming.
[03:29:01.279 --> 03:29:07.961]  If you go on YouTube and just Google urban farming, you're going to see a lot of videos that teach you how to do urban farming.
[03:29:08.321 --> 03:29:09.981]  So you can start growing your own food.
[03:29:10.481 --> 03:29:12.542]  Stock up things like rice, beans.
[03:29:12.722 --> 03:29:17.762]   You know, I usually, I love to buy Goya products because Like those, they are canned beans.
[03:29:17.802 --> 03:29:19.003]  They last for like seven years.
[03:29:19.703 --> 03:29:25.525]  And I tell people, don't throw away your food because it smells, because it looks, it's expired.
[03:29:25.865 --> 03:29:28.246]  Throw them away when it smells bad or looks bad.
[03:29:28.606 --> 03:29:33.768]  Because most of the times, the reason why they have expiration dates is just so that I can throw it away and buy new ones.
[03:29:34.288 --> 03:29:36.109]  So learn to preserve your food.
[03:29:36.289 --> 03:29:39.370]  Like rice, I mean, I am telling you, I'm never throwing my rice away.
[03:29:39.790 --> 03:29:44.472]  I eat it two, three years after it's expired and it still tastes just as good and it doesn't give me any problems.
[03:29:45.112 --> 03:29:47.094]  So, learn to preserve your food.
[03:29:47.714 --> 03:29:48.435]  Stock up food.
[03:29:49.276 --> 03:29:52.518]  Make sure that you have a kind of currency, like gold.
[03:29:52.558 --> 03:29:54.340]  You know, I know Alex talks a lot about gold.
[03:29:54.660 --> 03:29:57.762]  Make sure that you have, you know, you have gold, silver, and everything that you can use to barter.
[03:29:58.303 --> 03:30:04.107]  Like I said, you know, sell some of your Gucci shoes, and some of your Prada bags, and you know, and Michael Kors.
[03:30:04.147 --> 03:30:06.569]  Sell some of those things, and make sure you stock up food.
[03:30:07.030 --> 03:30:10.072]  Because one of the ways that you're gonna get people is with famine.
[03:30:10.492 --> 03:30:19.177]   If you read in Revelation chapter 6, when the seals are open, The first seal that was opened in Revelation Chapter 6 is the white horse.
[03:30:19.237 --> 03:30:20.918]  And the white horse was given two things.
[03:30:21.398 --> 03:30:25.199]  It was given a poisonous dart and a crown.
[03:30:25.540 --> 03:30:26.880]  And do you know what crown means?
[03:30:27.040 --> 03:30:28.241]  Crown means corona.
[03:30:28.541 --> 03:30:33.463]  So it was given corona and a poisonous dart, which is the jab, to use it to conquer the whole world.
[03:30:33.783 --> 03:30:35.403]  The second seal is wars.
[03:30:35.844 --> 03:30:38.385]  The Bible talks about it over wars and rumors of wars.
[03:30:38.444 --> 03:30:43.123]   There's wars going on right now in over 50 countries, active wars.
[03:30:43.123 --> 03:30:47.244]   The third seal is famine, a measure of which for a day's wages.
[03:30:47.244 --> 03:30:51.084]   Make sure you stock up food, water, water filtration system, everything.
[03:30:51.084 --> 03:30:53.424]  The third seal is death and hell.
[03:30:53.424 --> 03:30:55.324]  So make sure you're spiritually prepared.
[03:30:55.324 --> 03:30:56.804]  You give your life to Christ.
[03:30:56.804 --> 03:31:00.565]   Make sure that if the Lord Jesus come today, you are right with God.
[03:31:00.565 --> 03:31:05.404]   What we actually help people do, we help people to be medically prepared.
[03:31:05.468 --> 03:31:13.693]  Like I said, if you go to DrStellaMD.com, DrStellaMD.com, we have several things that will help you to be medically prepared.
[03:31:14.033 --> 03:31:18.115]  The first thing, like Alex and I discussed earlier, we have the pandemic packs.
[03:31:18.215 --> 03:31:28.020]  We have the COVID complete pack that has Ivermectin, Hydroxychloroquine, Budesonite, Z-Pak, and a handheld nebulizer.
[03:31:28.888 --> 03:31:30.150]  Here's the handheld nebulizer.
[03:31:30.551 --> 03:31:30.931]  I like it.
[03:31:30.971 --> 03:31:31.572]  It's really cute.
[03:31:32.253 --> 03:31:37.362]  You know, you can turn it on and then, you know, you do a breathing treatment by just turning it on, you know.
[03:31:39.912 --> 03:31:43.095]  When you hold this nebulizer, you can charge it with a power bank.
[03:31:43.175 --> 03:31:45.598]  In case there's no power, you don't have to go plug it.
[03:31:45.638 --> 03:31:57.670]  Most nebulizers are big and you have to go plug it, but this one, you can just plug it to a power bank, charge it, and if you need to use your biretsunite, if you have anything that you need breathing treatment, whether it's a B-roll, anything, you can just put it in here.
[03:31:57.910 --> 03:31:59.231]  This is water, this is not a treatment.
[03:31:59.572 --> 03:32:00.633]  And then you can use that.
[03:32:01.013 --> 03:32:03.535]  So we have it as part of the COVID Complete Pack.
[03:32:03.635 --> 03:32:07.838]  I tell everybody, get that COVID Complete Pack for your family right now.
[03:32:08.158 --> 03:32:11.381]  If you go on our website, if you use promo code Alex, you will get a discount.
[03:32:12.041 --> 03:32:16.605]  Get the COVID Complete Pack for your family, for your children, for everyone.
[03:32:16.645 --> 03:32:17.866]  Don't wait till you get sick.
[03:32:18.246 --> 03:32:24.591]  Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin will help you, whether it's Zika, whether it's Dengue, whether it's COVID.
[03:32:25.051 --> 03:32:29.253]  All these things are RNA viruses and because they are RNA viruses, they are actually sensitive.
[03:32:29.633 --> 03:32:32.514]  Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin are potent antivirals.
[03:32:32.794 --> 03:32:36.136]  They have studies that have been done about this for years.
[03:32:36.656 --> 03:32:46.500]  If you go to, there's a website called C19HCQ.com, you will see hundreds of studies that show that hydroxychloroquine works for viruses and for C19.
[03:32:46.980 --> 03:32:53.340]   Or if you go to IVM, C19ivm.com, these two websites, in fact I'm going to put
[03:32:53.340 --> 03:32:58.779]   the link on my Twitter handle, Stella_Emanu, you can pull it up there and look at it.
[03:32:58.779 --> 03:33:04.060]   Go to this website and take these articles, read them, and use it to wake up people, to
[03:33:04.060 --> 03:33:07.859]   show people that there are a lot of things that they are doing that is not right.
[03:33:07.841 --> 03:33:23.817]  So for you to survive, I'm just, I'm begging you, this is, I say this with all my heart and I always cry out because I deal with people calling me all the time because they are sick and then now things are bad and then they want me to come and save them out of the hospital or they want me to send them hydroxychloroquine now.
[03:33:24.638 --> 03:33:28.562]  If you wait till you get sick, you might have to wait five days to get your medicine.
[03:33:29.662 --> 03:33:31.923]  Because we're not going to call it to the mainstream pharmacies.
[03:33:32.843 --> 03:33:36.764]  During Delta, at all times still, we had like 2,000 people waiting to see us.
[03:33:37.324 --> 03:33:39.745]  We could not call prescriptions to mainstream pharmacies.
[03:33:39.785 --> 03:33:43.966]  There are some people that ended up losing their lives because they could not see us.
[03:33:44.506 --> 03:33:50.248]  So if you wait till things get crazy and we're jammed, and then there's no way for you to come see us, then it's going to be a problem.
[03:33:50.308 --> 03:33:53.229]  Or there's a cyber attack, or the computers are down and you can't see us.
[03:33:53.909 --> 03:33:55.070]  Be prepared right now.
[03:33:55.150 --> 03:33:57.953]  Get hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in your medicine cabinet.
[03:33:57.993 --> 03:34:05.700]  If you cannot afford to get the whole pack, you can order hydroxychloroquine individually or ivermectin individually, but you have to do the telemedicine appointment.
[03:34:05.940 --> 03:34:07.922]  Do it right now for you, for your family.
[03:34:08.323 --> 03:34:10.745]  Tell everybody, give them promo code ALEX.
[03:34:11.385 --> 03:34:13.427]  Be prepared right now.
[03:34:13.948 --> 03:34:18.992]  Don't wait till Zika gets here or till dengue or till monkeypox or COVID.
[03:34:19.092 --> 03:34:19.453]  All of them.
[03:34:20.033 --> 03:34:20.814]  It's all the same thing.
[03:34:21.114 --> 03:34:21.734]  So that's one.
[03:34:22.074 --> 03:34:26.777]  The second thing that we have is the seven antibiotics you need in an emergency.
[03:34:27.237 --> 03:34:28.858]  We have things like Z-Pak.
[03:34:28.898 --> 03:34:35.962]  We have Augmentin for chest infection, for throat infection, for pneumonia, for urine infection, for skin infection.
[03:34:36.362 --> 03:34:40.704]  And we even have, you know, an antifungal in case you get a yeast infection after you take the medicines.
[03:34:41.145 --> 03:34:42.265]  So we have that pack.
[03:34:42.325 --> 03:34:42.986]  We call it the...
[03:34:44.968 --> 03:34:47.968]  the emergency pack, 7 antibiotics you need in an emergency.
[03:34:47.968 --> 03:34:50.268]  You need to get that and put that in your medicine cabinet.
[03:34:50.268 --> 03:34:55.567]   When I say put it in your medicine cabinet, I'm not saying you should get these things and use them.
[03:34:55.567 --> 03:34:57.768]  Get it and put it in your medicine cabinet.
[03:34:57.768 --> 03:35:03.468]   The other thing that I have, I did a Twitter space, and I'm going to repost it so that you can pull it up.
[03:35:03.468 --> 03:35:07.568]   It's called "Over-the-counter medicines you will need in an emergency."
[03:35:07.662 --> 03:35:11.044]  They have a lot of over-the-counter medicines that you will need in an emergency.
[03:35:11.084 --> 03:35:23.753]  If you go and watch that space, write this thing down, put together a solid first aid kit that you can have over-the-counter so that if something happens, you have band-aid, you have antibiotic creams, you have things like...
[03:35:25.094 --> 03:35:26.695]  You have things like ace bandage.
[03:35:26.715 --> 03:35:29.456]  You have slings or whatever you need.
[03:35:29.797 --> 03:35:31.718]  We did a Twitter space on that.
[03:35:31.758 --> 03:35:37.461]  If you go to my Twitter handle, Stella underscore Emmanuel, I'm going to repost that after this show so that you'll be able to pull it up.
[03:35:37.761 --> 03:35:38.682]  Follow me on Twitter.
[03:35:38.762 --> 03:35:39.642]  Follow me on Rumble.
[03:35:39.962 --> 03:35:42.684]  So that way you can keep in touch with what I am doing.
[03:35:43.484 --> 03:35:47.167]  Now, the last thing that I want to talk about is actually just the supplements.
[03:35:47.207 --> 03:35:49.508]  You know, we put together amazing supplements.
[03:35:50.028 --> 03:35:54.171]  You see, there's a lot of people have zinc deficiency.
[03:35:54.551 --> 03:36:01.736]  There's an article that they did, this was actually did in the NIH, where they talk about the antivirus effectiveness of zinc, you know.
[03:36:02.476 --> 03:36:04.177]  Zinc is antiviral.
[03:36:04.498 --> 03:36:09.101]  Zinc helps to break the viral shell.
[03:36:09.521 --> 03:36:11.722]  But zinc cannot enter into the cell.
[03:36:12.343 --> 03:36:14.304]  Zinc has a problem getting into people's cells.
[03:36:14.324 --> 03:36:15.985]  That is why a lot of people are zinc deficient.
[03:36:16.005 --> 03:36:17.526]  That's why a lot of people get viruses.
[03:36:19.247 --> 03:36:22.609]  We need a transport system to get zinc into your system.
[03:36:23.250 --> 03:36:27.353]  So that you can be able to even absorb the zinc that is in our regular food.
[03:36:27.913 --> 03:36:29.494]  That is where quercetin comes in.
[03:36:29.894 --> 03:36:32.916]  That is the other way that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin works.
[03:36:32.976 --> 03:36:37.299]  If you go on our website, we have a vitamin called Covivite.
[03:36:37.460 --> 03:36:43.944]  And right now, we have 40% off on Covivite if you get a six month supply of Covivite on our website.
[03:36:44.324 --> 03:36:47.246]  And of course, if you use promo code Alex, you get an additional 5%.
[03:36:49.308 --> 03:37:01.096]  40%!
[03:36:50.529 --> 03:37:01.096]  This is like the best sale we've done, where you get 40% off, because we want to make sure the American people have a six-month supply of COVID vaccines to last them throughout this winter, throughout the election.
[03:37:01.437 --> 03:37:08.482]  So if you order the six-month supply, you have 40% off, and if you use promo code Alex, you get an additional 5% off.
[03:37:09.062 --> 03:37:11.204]  Get it, stock it up, start taking it.
[03:37:12.222 --> 03:37:17.146]  Build up your zinc stores so that that way you don't get any of these infections that are coming in.
[03:37:17.586 --> 03:37:19.468]  And here's the thing.
[03:37:20.489 --> 03:37:21.630]  Don't take too much zinc.
[03:37:21.670 --> 03:37:22.551]  If you take too much zinc...
[03:37:23.309 --> 03:37:26.289]  It can affect your copper and give you anemia.
[03:37:26.289 --> 03:37:27.408]  So that's what I'm telling people.
[03:37:27.408 --> 03:37:29.969]  I said, you know, make sure that you get prepared today.
[03:37:29.969 --> 03:37:31.568]  Our supplements are very great.
[03:37:31.568 --> 03:37:34.049]  On our website too, we have the medicinal herbs.
[03:37:34.049 --> 03:37:36.529]   There are a lot of people that don't even want to deal with medicine.
[03:37:36.529 --> 03:37:38.090]  They just want to take herbs.
[03:37:38.090 --> 03:37:43.129]   We have, you know, we have moringa, we have ginger, spirulina.
[03:37:43.129 --> 03:37:46.430]  These are grown non-GMO.
[03:37:46.430 --> 03:37:49.049]  My sister grows them in her farm in Africa.
[03:37:49.049 --> 03:37:50.930]  They package them and they send it to us.
[03:37:50.930 --> 03:37:54.289]   So we have these medicinal herbs, you know, turmeric and everything.
[03:37:54.289 --> 03:37:57.449]  We scoop them, mix them in a tea and drink them.
[03:37:57.449 --> 03:37:58.689]  It keeps you healthy.
[03:37:58.689 --> 03:38:02.049]   So if you don't even want to deal with medicine, you can take these medicinal herbs
[03:38:02.049 --> 03:38:03.549]  and it will also help you.
[03:38:03.549 --> 03:38:04.388]  So.
[03:38:04.787 --> 03:38:05.708]  Call to action.
[03:38:06.229 --> 03:38:07.730]  Number one, pray.
[03:38:08.211 --> 03:38:09.352]  Give your life to Christ.
[03:38:09.573 --> 03:38:10.514]  Pray for the nation.
[03:38:11.094 --> 03:38:12.896]  Number two, be prepared.
[03:38:13.277 --> 03:38:13.937]  Stock up food.
[03:38:14.058 --> 03:38:14.859]  Stock up water.
[03:38:15.019 --> 03:38:16.240]  Learn to grow your own food.
[03:38:16.701 --> 03:38:19.203]  Number three, be medically prepared.
[03:38:19.704 --> 03:38:28.532]  Go watch this video on my Twitter handle that says, over-the-counter medicines that you will need in an emergency.
[03:38:28.892 --> 03:38:31.655]  Make sure you have a solid emergency first aid kit.
[03:38:32.115 --> 03:38:35.518]  Number four, go on our website, DrStellaMD.com.
[03:38:35.718 --> 03:38:37.299]  Do a telemedicine appointment.
[03:38:37.660 --> 03:38:39.061]  Get the COVID complete pack.
[03:38:39.101 --> 03:38:40.843]  Get hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.
[03:38:41.203 --> 03:38:42.704]  Put it in your medicine cabinet.
[03:38:43.165 --> 03:38:45.186]  Get the emergency antibiotic pack.
[03:38:45.487 --> 03:38:46.788]  Keep it in your medicine cabinet.
[03:38:47.348 --> 03:38:49.789]  Number five, go to our marketplace.
[03:38:50.809 --> 03:38:56.571]  Get Covivite, you can get Covilite, you can get, because it's not just Covivite that has quercetin.
[03:38:56.611 --> 03:39:00.712]  Covivite, Covilite, Covicleanse, Covitaspray, they all have quercetin.
[03:39:00.952 --> 03:39:09.454]  But right now we're running this 40% sale on our products that have quercetin to help the American people to stock up, to last between now and through the election.
[03:39:10.254 --> 03:39:11.555]  Use promo code Alex.
[03:39:12.055 --> 03:39:24.260]  I really believe in what Alex does and if you go on our website and you show up, we help to keep this show on the air and we help to support Alex and we help to support a lot of other people.
[03:39:24.880 --> 03:39:25.481]  So listen!
[03:39:26.341 --> 03:39:28.042]  DrStellaMD.com.
[03:39:28.142 --> 03:39:29.262]  Use promo code Alex.
[03:39:29.663 --> 03:39:32.524]  I just pray that everything will be right with you.
[03:39:32.904 --> 03:39:36.386]  And remember, at the end of this battle, Jesus wins.
[03:39:36.466 --> 03:39:38.687]  At the end of this battle, you and I win.
[03:39:38.727 --> 03:39:41.368]  We are the American people and we are strong.
[03:39:41.848 --> 03:39:42.889]  See you again next week.
[03:39:42.989 --> 03:39:43.649]  God bless you.
[03:39:43.689 --> 03:39:44.950]  This is Dr. Stella Emmanuel.
[03:39:45.470 --> 03:39:58.438]  Explain how the central bank digital currency, ESG-controlled corporate governance, controlling what you can do and spend, corporations, governments, private individuals, how they use that as the next bubble with the unified ledger.
[03:39:58.518 --> 03:40:11.025]  This is key because their bridge to get out of this bubble is the next level of total control to take a giant slice of everybody's life, but not call it a bail-in, just call it a social credit score.
[03:40:11.803 --> 03:40:23.527]  Yeah, so let me, if I may, put this into the context of you and what you've gone through in this bankruptcy that you've had to go through and everything happening with InfoWars.
[03:40:24.127 --> 03:40:28.829]  You know, they didn't like what you had to say, so they froze you from your bank account.
[03:40:28.929 --> 03:40:30.729]  You couldn't access your money, right?
[03:40:32.610 --> 03:40:35.272]  But that took a legal process to get to that point.
[03:40:35.792 --> 03:40:38.754]  This is that exact same scenario.
[03:40:39.395 --> 03:40:42.797]  Them separating you from your money, but without a legal process.
[03:40:43.357 --> 03:40:44.918]  They can just do it because they don't like you.
[03:40:45.338 --> 03:40:46.819]  Because they don't like your ideology.
[03:40:46.839 --> 03:40:47.320]  Now, slow down.
[03:40:47.340 --> 03:40:48.380]  That's the scheme, Dr. Elliott.
[03:40:48.621 --> 03:40:50.682]  This is a central bank ledger.
[03:40:50.702 --> 03:40:51.983]  It just sounds like a term people know.
[03:40:52.103 --> 03:40:53.264]  Everyone is in bankruptcy.
[03:40:53.304 --> 03:40:55.805]  Private companies, corporations, the general public.
[03:40:55.825 --> 03:40:56.245]  That's what they say.
[03:40:56.265 --> 03:40:57.166]  They'll owe nothing and like it.
[03:40:57.506 --> 03:40:59.327]  And then they unify it and take what they want.
[03:40:59.628 --> 03:41:00.408]  Your mortgage.
[03:41:00.588 --> 03:41:01.489]  Everything is unified.
[03:41:01.929 --> 03:41:02.350]  Everything.
[03:41:02.710 --> 03:41:16.143]  See, every asset that you have that's in this digital form, whether it's a bank account, checking account, savings account, money market, stock bond, mutual fund, brokerage account, all of that stuff, and anything with a title like your house, right?
[03:41:16.183 --> 03:41:18.205]  You can be put into this unified ledger.
[03:41:18.926 --> 03:41:25.307]  Now, the World Economic Forum has explained this really well in the sense of this is digital money.
[03:41:25.387 --> 03:41:35.429]  It's programmable money, meaning they tokenize or they put all of your assets into a into a packet and that packet is now can be sold.
[03:41:35.750 --> 03:41:35.910]  Right.
[03:41:35.930 --> 03:41:37.050]  This is like a derivative.
[03:41:37.430 --> 03:41:44.491]  You can flip off the ownership with the flip of a button saying, OK, Alex, you no longer own all of this stuff that you thought you had.
[03:41:44.771 --> 03:41:51.094]   We're flipping the switch and we're going to give it to Person B, or person C, or to the government, right?
[03:41:51.134 --> 03:41:52.155]  They can do whatever they want.
[03:41:52.215 --> 03:41:55.737]  This is what programmable money and a unified ledger is.
[03:41:55.877 --> 03:42:02.861]  And to make it really dangerous is that it's based on your digital social profile and your social credit score.
[03:42:03.302 --> 03:42:07.144]  Now, we, you know, we're not talking about a dystopian future, right?
[03:42:07.464 --> 03:42:10.186]  We saw this happen with the truckers in Canada.
[03:42:10.766 --> 03:42:17.853]  They, their ideology, their, what they... Oh, the British Prime Minister said if you don't accept military service, we'll just turn your bank account off.
[03:42:18.233 --> 03:42:19.014]  That, two weeks ago.
[03:42:20.134 --> 03:42:21.555]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:42:22.035 --> 03:42:26.698]  So, so all of these things seem to be a stretch in people's minds, right?
[03:42:26.718 --> 03:42:28.480]  It's like, oh, this is the mark of the beast.
[03:42:28.500 --> 03:42:29.400]  This is way down the road.
[03:42:29.740 --> 03:42:31.121]  We've seen it, you know, bank accounts.
[03:42:31.141 --> 03:42:31.442]  That's right.
[03:42:31.462 --> 03:42:33.463]  You're not covering things that are coming.
[03:42:33.543 --> 03:42:34.764]  This is all being rolled out now.
[03:42:35.224 --> 03:42:41.929]  They have gas station chains all over Europe, the U.S., including in Oklahoma and Texas, where you've got to swipe a card to get in the building.
[03:42:41.949 --> 03:42:45.671]  You've got to swipe a card to buy gas just to prove you're even able to buy it.
[03:42:45.771 --> 03:42:48.233]  I mean, it's coming in.
[03:42:48.393 --> 03:42:51.215]   We're not just talking about Freedom here, right?
[03:42:51.275 --> 03:42:54.419]  Financial freedom, getting out of harm's way of these digital assets.
[03:42:54.439 --> 03:42:58.163]  We're also doing something that we get the best of both worlds.
[03:42:58.603 --> 03:43:00.405]  Asset protection and growth.
[03:43:00.966 --> 03:43:04.790]  And that's what makes it such an amazing godsend right now.
[03:43:04.990 --> 03:43:06.371]  Nothing is performed as good as silver.
[03:43:07.012 --> 03:43:11.957]  And I haven't had a silver gold sponsor because so many of them sell numismatics, ripping people off.
[03:43:11.997 --> 03:43:16.182]  You are the number one bullion dealer in America right now because you've got the best deals.
[03:43:16.202 --> 03:43:17.964]  Look at that 12-year graph, folks.
[03:43:18.504 --> 03:43:21.648]  This is a no-brainer to protect your assets and probably have growth.
[03:43:21.968 --> 03:43:26.593]  We can't guarantee anything, but my God, you're crazy if you don't call Dr. Kirk Elliott at 720-605-3900.
