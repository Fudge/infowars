[00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.910]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.670]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.109]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is election day and the most important election in world history.
[00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.090]  November 5th, 2024.
[00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.350]  And the enemy is out in the open.
[00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.710]  We have forced them to take the mask off.
[00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.679]  And they are openly flipping votes and removing Republican votes in Texas, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona.
[00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:06.459]  Judges are catching them left and right, finding illegal aliens by the millions and illegal voters on the rolls.
[00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:18.620]  It is crazy, but there is a mass endorsement of the heads of Black Lives Matter and Joe Rogan and everybody else of Donald Trump as people since the doom.
[00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:27.069]  Of a Harris-Waltz administration that's already been installed in a coup four months ago.
[00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:28.090]  Wow!
[00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.950]  Now, I was on the air until 10 o'clock last night doing an emergency broadcast.
[00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.370]  Harris is for this morning, 8 a.m.
[00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.670]  We're going to go right through past midnight tonight.
[00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:45.950]  We have an incredible raft of experts throughout the evening joining us.
[00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:47.930]  And I am going to be here...
[00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:58.489]  Regardless, right through until the morning, I've got my couch in my office, ready to take a nap at 3 a.m.
[00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:59.250]  if I need to.
[00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:07.670]  We got the coffee on the stove, and we are ready to go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:20.530]  So, I'm going to run through all the big developments, the epic history of what's happening, the white supremacists trying to blow up a Power station and knock the power off in areas of Tennessee that we predicted what happened right on time.
[00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.210]  And they're prepping the pump for false flags during a disputed election.
[00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:25.949]  Oh, we caught one, but we couldn't catch the other.
[00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.969]  It's very easy to call what's coming next when you understand the bigger picture.
[00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:49.009]  But I got to tell you, what I see in the grassroots and what I see from the scientific polls is a landslide so big for Trump that in my gut, I know Trump's going to win if they don't kill him.
[00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:56.629]  In fact, it may be so big that he is the president tonight, president-elect.
[00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:02.409]  The Democrats, again, I went over it yesterday, today, there's been more big developments.
[00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:12.590]  They're being caught everywhere because Trump got control, partial control, but that's better than no control, of the RNC in the last few years.
[00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:22.550]  And they've got the poll watchers, the lawyers, the experts, and they're catching them red-handed with algorithms running on the machines in Harris County.
[00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.389]  You don't really think Texas cities are blue, do you?
[00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:35.430]  And removing thousands and thousands and thousands of registered Republicans off, flipping them to Democrats.
[00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.370]  I mean...
[00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.039]  It is wild.
[00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.680]  Same thing in Pennsylvania, all the key Republican districts.
[00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.080]  Oh, the computers all failed.
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.039]  Just leave your ballots here.
[00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.159]  We'll count them later.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.560]  And then the judges that are 80-plus percent Democrat in Pennsylvania, same thing in Michigan, same thing in Texas, because they care.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.979]  They get in there because they'll just pull down the American flag out of your yard or brainwash your seven-year-old son that he's really a girl.
[00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:04.419]  They're all about creeping around passive-aggressive criminal activity.
[00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:05.439]  It's what cowards do.
[00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.500]  So it is just bonkers crazy.
[00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:12.800]  But this is just insane.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.080]  Absolutely wild.
[00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.259]  And remember, this is not a spectator sport.
[00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.980]  It's an Infowar.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:27.439]  Take the live feeds from RealAlexJones on X and at Infowars.com forward slash show and share them and tell folks, hey, here's the election coverage to watch right here.
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.319]  This is where you get what's really happening.
[00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:33.199]  RealAlexJones on X. Share the link now, [...] now.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.040]  I'll say it again, man.
[00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:37.259]  I think this is the last election.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.259]  If Trump doesn't win, this is the last election.
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.959]  I think you're right.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.839]  I think you're right.
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.279]  I think people, and a lot of people, are waking up and realize that, that have been lifelong Democrats.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.920]  Guys like Bill Ackman, guys like Chamath, Tulsi Gabbard switched over to the Republicans.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.199]  There's a lot of people who their whole life, they've been left-wing and they realize, like, I can't do this anymore.
[00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:59.180]  You and I used to be Democrats.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.519]  Yeah.
[00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:02.040]  It's nuts.
[00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.470]  It's nuts, man.
[00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:10.089]  If the Dems win this election, they will legalize enough illegals to turn the swing states, and everywhere will be like California.
[00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.529]  There will be no escape.
[00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:13.269]  That is so insane.
[00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:15.290]  This is the final...
[00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.430]  This is it.
[00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.509]  This is the last chance.
[00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.769]  Has anybody tried to push back?
[00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.149]  Go out and vote.
[00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.949]  Vote like your life depends on it, vote like your future depends on it, because it does.
[00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.959]  You know, I've had a liner we've aired for 20 years that I wrote 20 years ago.
[00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:41.160]  Where it says, and now from the heart of the resistance, Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.600]  And then a mile from here, Elon Musk yesterday...
[00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.569]  Joe Rogan, J.D. Vance, Trump, all of it.
[00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.970]  I mean, this really is the heart of the resistance.
[00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.430]  And of course, Austin's Republican.
[00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.430]  It's been total election fraud.
[00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.569]  I proved it 25 years ago.
[00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.089]  It was even in the newspaper that they stole the election.
[00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.910]  We discovered it.
[00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:01.449]  The state still certified it.
[00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.930]  Once your city goes blue, you can't vote yourself out of it.
[00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.689]  We're good to go.
[00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.970]  We're good to go.
[00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:31.910]  We're good to go.
[00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.089]  Of this election today.
[00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:40.029]  In fact, I'm going to turn this into a t-shirt after Trump wins.
[00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:54.350]  Remember, they were able, after the tabulation centers closed in Pennsylvania and Georgia and Michigan and other bilateral states, to suddenly get the extra votes to go straight up total fraud and defeat Trump.
[00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:10.050]  But I believe that's what the curve is going to look like today because there's such a massive, gargantuan, ridiculous That the graph they put out will be a lot narrower than that,
[00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:13.569]  but that's the reality of what is about to happen.
[00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:24.029]  Now, that said, they didn't have a lot of eyes watching them when they stole it four years ago.
[00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.829]  I mean, we caught them, and it's all been vindicated, and it took years to prove it in court.
[00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:32.689]  The judges all over the country four years ago said, well, we're not going to look at it.
[00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.370]  You have no standing.
[00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:35.230]  So the media said, oh, look, there's no proof.
[00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:36.589]  No, the judges said, we're not looking at that.
[00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:37.870]  That's not what this is.
[00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:46.850]  Well, now the judges have, and they found fraud everywhere worse than what I said, worse than what Trump said, worse than what we saw in those weeks when they stole the election.
[00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:52.160]  And now they promised when Trump wins to try to block him there and not certify.
[00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:55.639]  So the fight's not over if he wins in a landslide tonight.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.279]  Roger is rarely wrong.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:03.040]  Roger Stone's joining us many times today, this afternoon and then later in the evening.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.620]  But he said, very good chance.
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:20.790]  We said it on air a few days ago, Sunday, that we have Trump as the winner late tonight or early in the morning, 1 a.m., 2 a.m., But the globalists could set off a nuke or something and, you know, say Russia did it.
[00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.889]  I mean, this is crazy town.
[00:08:24.029 --> 00:08:29.670]  So just because you see a huge landslide and a lot of the establishments are already capitulating, saying, we can't steal it now.
[00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:30.350]  It's too obvious.
[00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:32.230]  We've got to just try to destroy Trump once he's in.
[00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.669]  There's big sectors and different factions that aren't going to stop.
[00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.309]  So this is the most consequential thing.
[00:08:44.229 --> 00:08:52.909]  Urgent, existential, meaning life-threatening to our freedoms, our country, and our very existence that our nation has ever been in.
[00:08:53.009 --> 00:08:57.289]  And World War III is up for referendum on the ballot today.
[00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:04.429]  And again, the election workers themselves, most of them aren't criminals.
[00:09:04.629 --> 00:09:07.769]  Now, some of the key judges have been caught and are Democrat Party operatives, most of them.
[00:09:08.429 --> 00:09:12.350]  But the companies just go in and program the machines to mess up.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.000]  And they've got algorithms built in where they only mess up specifically when they need to.
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.980]  And it's all baked in.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.559]  And it's going on everywhere.
[00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:27.100]  They've got judges slapping it down in live time.
[00:09:27.299 --> 00:09:28.320]  They're catching them.
[00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:33.509]  They're catching Democrats saying, oh, we're just going to have people vote for days and weeks after.
[00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:35.210]  Judges are slapping that down.
[00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.309]  Oh, we're having illegals vote.
[00:09:36.789 --> 00:09:38.370]  Supreme Court slapped that down in one state.
[00:09:38.529 --> 00:09:41.110]  So, this stuff is at least coming out in the open.
[00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:54.970]  That is, the big news is, even if the globalists steal this, which I don't think they're going to be able to do, it will be a Pyrrhic victory, where they win the battle, lose the war, because that will even blow up in their face bigger.
[00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.129]  Though they're going to try.
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.179]  Because it's so out in the open now.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.299]  But here is my election prediction in a meme.
[00:10:06.919 --> 00:10:08.059]  Put it back on screen.
[00:10:09.059 --> 00:10:10.080]  There it is.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.659]  I just really focused on it last night.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.080]  Got home about 11 after working.
[00:10:16.659 --> 00:10:18.940]  Sat in a chair in the dark for about an hour.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.440]  Drinking ice water.
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:27.200]  And Trump is going to be re-elected.
[00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.750]  I don't see how they beat.
[00:10:32.629 --> 00:10:35.210]  Probably 70% of voters are going for him.
[00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.110]  I mean, I work out in a liberal area of South Austin.
[00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.909]  And I sit there and ask people and they talk to me.
[00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.250]  Women, blacks, old, young, Hispanics.
[00:10:46.029 --> 00:10:47.429]  Everybody's voted for Trump.
[00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:49.889]  And that's what I hear from all over the country.
[00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.549]  And then you see all the former leftists coming out.
[00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:57.110]  Joe Rogan's always pledged to not be political and endorse anybody.
[00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.769]  I told you he's closeted Trump for four years.
[00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.870]  But I didn't want to say that.
[00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.809]  But I mean, he's been there.
[00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.450]  But he's all in.
[00:11:06.029 --> 00:11:06.590]  Endorsed Trump.
[00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.870]  Officially on his ex last night.
[00:11:10.409 --> 00:11:11.909]  And that's a signal.
[00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:15.230]  Kind of like Alex Jones is the first to support Trump.
[00:11:16.169 --> 00:11:17.929]  And then Rogan's the last.
[00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:20.309]  But you see that there.
[00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:22.710]  The sign that it's a total realignment politically.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.340]  And I told you three years ago that Musk was going to get super hardcore because, well, I'll just leave it at that.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.320]  I've been talking to certain people that are very close to Musk.
[00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:35.419]  Very hard to get any closer.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.480]  So, why would people tell me that if that wasn't actually what they were going to do?
[00:11:42.139 --> 00:11:43.059]  And I told you.
[00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:44.399]  People were like, oh, shut up, Jones.
[00:11:44.539 --> 00:11:46.379]  Rogan's not going to come out for us.
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.720]  Oh, yeah, right.
[00:11:48.919 --> 00:11:53.600]  I mean, have the archivist find me four years ago saying both Musk and Rogan are about to get hardcore.
[00:11:55.279 --> 00:12:06.700]  They saw what was coming, they understood what was happening, and then they build the crescendo and then show you who they are when, politically, it has the maximum effect.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.299]  So, you saw Zuckerberg roll over.
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.879]  I said, six months ago, you better roll over.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.139]  Two months later, he rolled over.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:14.740]  Three months later?
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:22.580]  I mean, we've got our nose to the grindstone here, and I've said to the globalists, listen, you don't have to completely join us, just get out of the way.
[00:12:24.049 --> 00:12:29.590]  Because you know your bosses are going to start World War III and Civil War, and you will lose in that.
[00:12:29.769 --> 00:12:33.389]  It's going to be horrible, it's going to be destructive, but you're smart.
[00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.549]  Put the numbers together.
[00:12:35.549 --> 00:12:36.769]  You will lose.
[00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:37.929]  100%.
[00:12:37.929 --> 00:12:43.269]  So, you want to do this the easy way or the hard way?
[00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:50.929]  And they've got their NGOs and their leftist groups all baked in with their money and their orders.
[00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:56.960]  And the election officials and all these key battleground states and counties who are going to go forward with the fraud regardless.
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.559]  But this time, they are being caught everywhere.
[00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:03.960]  It is spectacular.
[00:13:05.679 --> 00:13:07.899]  I spent two hours last night going over the latest.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.620]  There's hours of stuff here today.
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.799]  It is crazy town.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:14.460]  And then you've got the Pentagon.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.120]  Oh, there's no absentee ballots for the active duty, first time ever.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:18.679]  Just sorry.
[00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:19.419]  They don't get to vote.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.500]  That's total election fraud right there.
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.740]  That could be a game changer if it wasn't such a landslide.
[00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:26.820]  And then all the states with the federal judges, yeah, illegals can vote.
[00:13:27.179 --> 00:13:29.139]  Texas Secretary of State, five weeks ago, yeah, illegals.
[00:13:29.419 --> 00:13:31.440]  You got a non-citizen ID, you can vote.
[00:13:31.539 --> 00:13:32.139]  Don't ask questions.
[00:13:33.019 --> 00:13:35.840]  Then you go out of California, the person says, hey, you want to check my name?
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.799]  You want to make sure it's the right person?
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:37.460]  No, we don't care.
[00:13:37.759 --> 00:13:38.519]  Whoever you are, you can vote.
[00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:44.429]  And then all these folks from Europe visiting other places go in and vote just to show it and videotape it.
[00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:57.250]  Then, James O'Keefe, the video's coming up, goes into a voting station, and he doesn't even go in.
[00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:57.950]  He's out on the street.
[00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.570]  And they're like, absolutely, illegal, non-citizen, you can vote.
[00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:01.870]  Nope.
[00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:03.470]  So they send people in with voting.
[00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.149]  This form they're giving from the NGO across the street.
[00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.070]  Well, I'm an illegal alien.
[00:14:09.129 --> 00:14:09.590]  Can I vote?
[00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:11.389]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:12.029]  You can vote.
[00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:14.429]  Can I vote on the national ticket?
[00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:14.710]  Yep.
[00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:18.870]  And now the national media is going, oh, he violated civil rights.
[00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.129]  He secretly videotaped people voting.
[00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.470]  No.
[00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:31.330]  He sent a woman up to the front of it with the flyer from 80 feet across the street or 60 feet across the street at the NGO that tells them to go vote.
[00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:32.070]  And they go, that's right.
[00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:33.230]  Come on in and vote.
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:44.919]  They exposed fraud in Philadelphia, in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.419]  And it's everywhere.
[00:14:48.139 --> 00:14:54.820]  O'Keefe showed it in San Antonio, Houston, Austin, Dallas, any blue city, this stuff's going on.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:13.000]  And so, the illegals, you know, come in to get free food and some goodies at the NGO, they help sign up for welfare, jobs, and then, but, you gotta go across the street and vote right there, they give them the flyer, they come up, person talks to them in Spanish or English, whatever language,
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:13.899]  come on in.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.159]  Well, I'm not a citizen, doesn't matter, you can vote.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.700]  Remember what Obama said on the eve of the election eight years ago, he said, yeah, if you're here, you can vote.
[00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.889]  So, they bus them up in Pennsylvania.
[00:15:27.149 --> 00:15:27.929]  You saw that last week.
[00:15:28.049 --> 00:15:29.549]  The illegals get off, go up and vote.
[00:15:29.909 --> 00:15:31.090]  The names don't even matter.
[00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:31.789]  They go, it doesn't matter.
[00:15:31.789 --> 00:15:32.429]  Go on and vote.
[00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.029]  Oh, sorry.
[00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:34.669]  Citizens, it's closed for you.
[00:15:35.889 --> 00:15:37.490]  And Trump won court cases there.
[00:15:37.649 --> 00:15:40.710]  So, you gotta stop shutting the poll places at 1pm.
[00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:56.649]  So, A lot of people say, well, the elections are rigged, don't vote, or there's already tyranny in place, don't speak out against it.
[00:15:58.009 --> 00:16:02.750]  No, historically, you engage it, you draw it out, you draw its fire.
[00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:17.730]  That's a classic military maneuver to send in a smaller unit to draw out the enemy so that your larger force can then move against the enemy after it's been revealed and what their formations are and you get intel.
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.879]  And so I've studied history.
[00:16:21.019 --> 00:16:21.740]  I've studied politics.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.100]  I've studied statesmanship history.
[00:16:24.899 --> 00:16:32.320]  And I've been saying this for 25 plus years on air that this was my mission.
[00:16:33.299 --> 00:16:34.860]  And would you join me in this mission?
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.539]  This is your mission if you choose to accept it.
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.120]  And millions of you did.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:44.080]  And you kept us on air despite all the attacks for the moment we are in right now.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.220]  I'm going to go through all the news here today.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.440]  Let me tell you who we've got.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.860]  General Michael Flynn coming up in about 12 minutes.
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:12.839]  Darren J. Beattie, Viva Frye, Gavin McGinnis, Stephen Crowder, Benny Johnson, Luke Radowski, Roger Stone, Candace Horbach, and many,
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:13.819]  many others.
[00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:15.700]  Benny Johnson...
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.000]  Jack Posobiec.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.119]  Robert Barnes is back one out, but he thinks we'll be able to do it.
[00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:28.660]  And we've got listeners around the country.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:36.819]  We'll be doing spaces, simulcast on X. And we will be here as long as it takes.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:51.460]  If I need to be, I will go straight through until, say, 3 a.m., So we're getting all the reports, and then I'll go sleep three or four hours, and I'll be back on air at 8 a.m., and so will the rest of the crew.
[00:17:52.819 --> 00:17:53.839]  So they're dedicated.
[00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:55.079]  I appreciate them.
[00:17:55.279 --> 00:17:56.400]  I want to thank them.
[00:17:58.799 --> 00:18:13.849]  Now, of course, you've also got the white supremacists that the FBI in their own press release admits have been watching for a long time, provided the explosives to, drove with him to carry out the attack, did Nordic rituals with him, The guy looks like he's got an extra chromosome,
[00:18:13.849 --> 00:18:21.769]  and he's going to try to blow up a power station that knocked out the power to part of a city, an accelerationist.
[00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:26.890]  Will there be more to taxes they've been predicting once a disputed election?
[00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:30.329]  Yeah, this is, oh, we busted one, but we couldn't stop them all.
[00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:38.349]  I think that's not what I'm predicting, but that's, from all the past behavior of these people, that's exactly what I would think is probably going on.
[00:18:39.299 --> 00:18:41.740]  Big Governor Whitmer-style kidnappings, bombings.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.920]  He also wanted to do mass shootings of black people.
[00:18:44.299 --> 00:18:47.779]  How many times did I tell you they're going to wind up a white supremacist to go kill a bunch of black people?
[00:18:48.259 --> 00:18:56.740]  And they admit in the filing and the arrest stuff that he wanted to go do a mass shooting, but I guess they couldn't quite provocateur him into that.
[00:18:57.259 --> 00:18:59.400]  So then he says, no, I'm not going to do the mass shooting now.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.279]  I'm going to knock the power out.
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:03.579]  So...
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.880]  Almost all these plots with the FBI, whether it's white supremacists or Muslims, turn out to be provocateur.
[00:19:11.339 --> 00:19:13.180]  And they don't even deny it in the press release.
[00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:14.140]  I covered it last night.
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:14.900]  I had a copy of that.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:25.220]  He has to be in the Justice Department press release on the sting where they got him out there with the drone, with the explosives, a whole nine yards with this Schuyler...
[00:19:27.779 --> 00:19:32.240]  Because I had that last night in the other studio, the Alex Jones Network studio.
[00:19:33.019 --> 00:19:35.140]  That's miles away from here.
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.299]  Let me reprint that.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:36.640]  That'd be great.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:36.880]  Thanks.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.779]  So, we have that to get into.
[00:19:42.079 --> 00:19:43.079]  Here's the headlines.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.099]  This is AOL, AP, you name it.
[00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:49.500]  Widespread voting news.
[00:19:50.059 --> 00:19:52.700]  Problems reported in two heavily Republican Pennsylvania counties.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.819]  How interesting!
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:20:03.480]  And the same thing in Texas, and the same thing in Georgia, and the same thing in North Carolina, and Michigan, just everywhere.
[00:20:03.599 --> 00:20:04.279]  Isn't that magic?
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.839]  Just like the votes always flip from Republican to Democrat.
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.319]  Voting tabulating machines in Michigan and Pennsylvania are reporting errors, with many being down.
[00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:19.500]  Local officials are telling voters they'll just scan their ballots for them later in the evening when they choose.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.019]  Some locations are also reporting that they have the wrong tabulators.
[00:20:23.779 --> 00:20:28.380]  How can the United States be the most advanced nation, but we can't hold a simple election without this nonsense?
[00:20:28.539 --> 00:20:34.500]  Well, we always decided on the night of, or the next morning, until Trump won in 2016, and then...
[00:20:34.839 --> 00:20:36.640]  After that, it never works again.
[00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:41.180]  And, you know, the head folks there in Arizona are saying, this is just the way it is now.
[00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:44.619]  And the lady that ran the election four years ago, she became the governor.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.539]  And there's videos of all this.
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:57.039]  Reports are coming in from Pennsylvania that voting machines access in the western part of the state are experiencing issues due to problems with their flash drives.
[00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.250]  Machines are reportedly failing to scan ballots.
[00:21:00.369 --> 00:21:02.809]  The poll workers saying they'll do it later.
[00:21:03.309 --> 00:21:08.869]  Saying scan it later in the equivalent of saying this is safe and effective.
[00:21:11.589 --> 00:21:13.250]  Pennsylvania election integrity.
[00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:18.589]  This has all been confirmed.
[00:21:18.869 --> 00:21:29.369]  Early this morning, we learned that Republican poll watchers in Philadelphia, York, Westmoreland, and other whole bunch of counties were being turned away.
[00:21:29.589 --> 00:21:37.069]  We deployed our roving attorneys, engaged with local officials, and can now report that all Republican poll watchers have been let into the building.
[00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:38.369]  Yeah, they're committing a crime doing that.
[00:21:38.569 --> 00:21:42.309]  We will keep fighting, keep winning, and keep sharing updates.
[00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:45.329]  That's from the Voting Integrity group there.
[00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:48.589]  And again, they're the ones that always break it.
[00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.190]  And later, this is all confirmed in the news.
[00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.769]  Voters at Cambria County PA polling places.
[00:21:55.289 --> 00:22:01.849]  And it goes on to say that they're telling them the machines don't work, but just fill it out and do it that way.
[00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.549]  Wow.
[00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.049]  Just hand it to us.
[00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.029]  We'll take care of it for you.
[00:22:05.799 --> 00:22:11.960]  Breaking major security concerns raised by the discovery of an algorithm in Houston, Harris County voter rolls.
[00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:23.180]  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's office urged to investigate Harris County voter rolls after algorithm discovered signals potential tracking and classification of voters.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.440]  Yep, running an algorithm on it to decide who to shave off.
[00:22:27.519 --> 00:22:28.539]  And here it is.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:33.619]  Harris County, Texas, thousands of votes disappeared from early voting, and the lead went from Republican to Democrat.
[00:22:34.609 --> 00:22:35.970]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:22:38.569 --> 00:22:44.349]  And of course, you got the meme of Kamala Harris' Princess Leia talking to R2-D2 and said it's a Dominion voting machine.
[00:22:44.349 --> 00:22:45.470]  She says, help me, Dominion.
[00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:47.029]  You're my only hope.
[00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:48.450]  Help me, Obi-Wan.
[00:22:48.529 --> 00:22:49.250]  You're my only hope.
[00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:50.369]  Help me, Dominion.
[00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.490]  You're my only hope.
[00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:56.349]  And of course, it is Dominion all over the country, magically flipping the ballots, confirmed.
[00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:01.690]  But you heard the Soros Attorney General last week in Michigan.
[00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.529]  She just said, it's everywhere, it's okay.
[00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:08.070]  Breaking!
[00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:12.250]  The margins don't add up right now for the Democrats in any of these battleground states.
[00:23:12.569 --> 00:23:13.509]  CNN reporting.
[00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:15.349]  Yeah, it's not looking good despite the fraud.
[00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:18.210]  Breaking!
[00:23:18.369 --> 00:23:25.690]  The Georgia Supreme Court just ruled that ballots cannot be accepted and counted after the deadline by election officials anywhere in the state.
[00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:33.410]  Democrats in Cobb County wanted to accept 3,000 mail-in ballots after the election day deadline, but the court just shut down their plans.
[00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:36.630]  And it happened in a bunch of other states.
[00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.450]  There's video of this.
[00:23:38.849 --> 00:23:48.690]  Assistant County Manager Zach Scuria has confirmed that full election results might take days to announce every election day in Maricopa County.
[00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:50.829]  He now says this is normal.
[00:23:51.329 --> 00:23:52.470]  The new normal.
[00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:59.829]  And there's a new major glitch they just announced, magically.
[00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:04.150]  And then they get caught lying, and the last glitch covered up the illegal aliens.
[00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.890]  That we're voting.
[00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:07.130]  And don't forget this.
[00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:08.150]  Election treason.
[00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:10.410]  Pentagon blocks active duty military for participating in election.
[00:24:10.869 --> 00:24:12.089]  All illegals publicly vote.
[00:24:12.369 --> 00:24:13.069]  Nope, sorry.
[00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:13.589]  Active duty.
[00:24:13.809 --> 00:24:15.049]  No absentee balances.
[00:24:15.349 --> 00:24:16.250]  We just didn't make them.
[00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:16.650]  Sorry.
[00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:17.190]  Bye-bye.
[00:24:17.349 --> 00:24:17.829]  Shut up.
[00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:19.230]  Take a poison shot.
[00:24:19.369 --> 00:24:19.950]  Here you go.
[00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.210]  Election game changer.
[00:24:25.329 --> 00:24:26.690]  Federal judge orders 1.2 million.

[00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:44.890]  Top California power company to conduct public safety power outages across the state on election day, knocking out at least 7,000 polling stations potentially.
[00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:52.690]  Texas deploys rapid response legal team across the state to prevent bad actors seeking to unduly influence or illegally undermine Texas elections.
[00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:59.069]  Show all the gaslighting that this stuff doesn't exist isn't working and James O'Keefe caught illegal aliens.
[00:25:00.129 --> 00:25:07.349]  Openly voting with the help of the election officials, and now he's the criminal for filming it at the door, them admitting it.
[00:25:07.509 --> 00:25:08.609]  No, he's a hero.
[00:25:10.109 --> 00:25:11.529]  We're going to go to break.
[00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:17.609]  General Flynn's going to give us his take on what's really happening and the enemy's tricks up their sleeves.
[00:25:19.339 --> 00:25:21.180]  But now I want to tell you about something very exciting.
[00:25:21.299 --> 00:25:26.059]  I'm telling you for months it was coming in because this stuff is made in North Carolina and the Panhandle of Florida.
[00:25:26.299 --> 00:25:37.180]  The hurricanes messed it up, but now it's in and we're very excited because everyone should be doing this in the winter with all the viruses and crap and things they put out.

[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:45.980]  It's not marked up.

[00:28:01.779 --> 00:28:03.619]  That was just insane.
[00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:11.019]  And the things he was posting, he was posting good things.
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.279]  He was saying, hey, do not riot.
[00:28:14.599 --> 00:28:16.740]  Don't do any destruction of property.
[00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:18.460]  Please stay calm.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.500]  That's the kind of stuff he was posting.
[00:28:21.119 --> 00:28:21.319]  Yeah.
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.460]  And you're like, uh, what's wrong with that?
[00:28:23.619 --> 00:28:31.700]  And then there's the fact that we know that there was agents in the crowd that were agent provocateurs that were encouraging people to do illegal shit.
[00:28:31.859 --> 00:28:32.059]  Yes.
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:33.180]  We know that for a fact.
[00:28:33.319 --> 00:28:33.980]  This is not...
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:39.079]  That was always the big Alex Jones type tinfoil hat conspiracy theory.
[00:28:39.279 --> 00:28:43.599]  Because Alex proposed that back at the World Trade Organization protests.
[00:28:43.819 --> 00:28:45.920]  I believe we were in Seattle in the 90s.
[00:28:48.659 --> 00:28:50.059]  Right.
[00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:08.750]  So you couldn't protest, you couldn't exercise your First Amendment rights.
[00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:13.230]  You couldn't even, like, have a peaceful protest, a fucking sticker on your car.
[00:29:13.329 --> 00:29:14.029]  You couldn't have that.
[00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:15.089]  It's crazy.
[00:29:15.309 --> 00:29:15.809]  It is crazy.
[00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:35.190]  We're good to go.
[00:29:44.019 --> 00:29:52.259]  We're good to go.
[00:30:08.049 --> 00:30:12.710]  Yeah, and I am at probably the healthiest place on the planet.
[00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:15.049]  Seed to table here, Alex, and to your great audience.
[00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.150]  This is a very, very important day for the country.
[00:30:18.289 --> 00:30:19.589]  It's historically consequential.
[00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:22.609]  I'm glad that you planned pieces of the Elon Rogan interview.
[00:30:22.769 --> 00:30:23.549]  Those guys matter.
[00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:26.349]  They matter a lot to our country and to the survival of our country.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.900]  I do believe that we're going to see a big Trump victory.
[00:30:30.119 --> 00:30:37.000]  We're already seeing the turnout in the rural parts of the country and all the swing states are much, much higher than 2020.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.720]  The urban center turnout is actually lower in many cases.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.559]  That doesn't mean anybody needs to assume anything.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.119]  At this point in time, if you're in line, stay in line.
[00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:55.900]  If you're watching this feed right now, if you're watching Alex and the Alex Jones show, then stay in line and don't let anybody tell you to otherwise.
[00:30:56.099 --> 00:30:56.900]  Don't assume anything.
[00:30:57.299 --> 00:31:01.500]  Now, what I believe is going to happen is I believe we're going to see a victory tonight.
[00:31:01.859 --> 00:31:03.440]  And that's a good thing for the country.
[00:31:03.559 --> 00:31:04.759]  It's a good thing for our future.
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:22.990]  What I do, I am concerned about, seriously concerned about, is I'm concerned about The safety and security of not only Donald J. Trump, but going forward over these next few days and weeks,
[00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:26.089]  we've already heard what the Democrats, what the left, plans on doing.
[00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:31.410]  We've heard what the thugs like Jamie Raskin have said they're going to do.
[00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:33.049]  They're not going to allow...
[00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:37.789]  For Trump to basically go into office.
[00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:39.390]  I mean, these people are not done.
[00:31:39.609 --> 00:31:40.650]  They are not done.
[00:31:40.849 --> 00:31:47.930]  So I think everything that we have seen them do, they will double or triple down when there is a victory tonight for Donald J. Trump.
[00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:59.240]  And I do, again, my biggest concern, because they've already tried it a couple of times, is for the safety of And security and the health of President Donald J. Trump here.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:05.000]  So, one of the things going forward for everybody to know is that this is not over with this election.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.819]  This actually begins the hard part.
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:11.380]  Getting here, I know it was difficult, and we've been fighting it for years.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:17.420]  You know, from the fake J6 events that was a complete setup.
[00:32:18.089 --> 00:32:21.529]  All the way to these assassination attempts.
[00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:27.509]  We can go through the litany of things that they have attempted to do with Donald Trump and frankly, myself.
[00:32:28.109 --> 00:32:36.650]  But as we go forward, the national security of this country is at risk, and we still have a couple of months to deal with this administration.
[00:32:37.759 --> 00:32:40.960]  Obviously, Joe Biden is not in charge.
[00:32:41.299 --> 00:32:42.779]  He's definitely not in charge.
[00:32:43.279 --> 00:32:46.960]  Harris is being manipulated every single day.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:33:00.240]  She has no ability to be able to be a commander-in-chief, to be the senior law enforcement officer for this country, which is also a hat that the President of the United States wears, nor is she capable of being the President of the United States.
[00:33:00.359 --> 00:33:01.299]  There's just no way.
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:12.400]  And it is undeniable To all the people that not only watch your show, but everybody that has tried to even remotely listen to her try to answer any real tough questions.
[00:33:12.619 --> 00:33:23.420]  So going forward, I do predict tonight we're going to see a, I wouldn't call it a landslide, but I do believe that Donald J. Trump is going to come out victorious this evening.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:32.230]  We should know this evening there should be no The reason why we should not know this evening, they want to take this country over, and I mean that very precisely.
[00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:33.450]  They are not done.
[00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:37.950]  And so we have to continue to keep people, you know, focused.
[00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:45.250]  I think the citizen journalists, you know, you're at the top of that list right there, my friend.
[00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:59.039]  You've been at this for decades, and the honesty and integrity and truth that you have been Providing to anybody who's listening, and certainly to the American people, has all come to fruition.
[00:33:59.319 --> 00:34:08.920]  And right now, it's the fruition that we are talking about is the ability for the United States of America to remain a constitutional republic.
[00:34:09.079 --> 00:34:11.880]  You look at these beautiful people that you're showing right now.
[00:34:12.059 --> 00:34:15.519]  You look at these beautiful people that you're showing right now at some of these rallies, right?
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:20.320]  Or these clowns, these clowns that are on the mainstream corporate woke media.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:30.300]  There are people that we have to get in front of, and we're going to have to get the team of people.
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.860]  I've heard already today from Tucker.
[00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:34.659]  I've heard from Vivek Ramaswamy.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.199]  I've heard from Eric Trump.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:41.199]  I've heard from a couple of others who are in the camp down there.
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:45.980]  I'm over on the Gulf Coast of Florida with a large, large group of people here tonight.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:52.079]  Throughout the night, we'll be broadcasting from here, because Florida is already looking good.
[00:34:52.219 --> 00:35:05.599]  Florida has done a great job with their elections, and I went and early voted myself the other day, and I felt very confident in how it was done, very professionally and very securely.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:21.690]  I do think that, you know, the crazy thing, Alex, is all of the problem areas where we see, some problem areas, right, machines down and Alright, General Flynn, General Flynn, hold on a moment while your Skype connection or Zoom connection,
[00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:24.070]  whatever we're using, comes back because you're saying some really important things.
[00:35:24.289 --> 00:35:29.829]  When your Skype last cut out a few minutes ago, you were bringing up the globalists being in deep trouble, then it cut out.
[00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:41.789]  How big is it to have Elon Musk come out, I don't know if you saw it yesterday, and openly say, the new world order global government is unelected and is out to get us and wants to enslave us, and there is no future.
[00:35:42.659 --> 00:35:44.199]  Everyone's life is in danger.
[00:35:44.579 --> 00:35:45.860]  This is existential.
[00:35:46.179 --> 00:35:48.800]  Exactly what you were saying a month ago on my show and studio.
[00:35:49.159 --> 00:36:01.159]  To have him out there, to have Joe Rogan coming out and saying it, this shows the political realignment is so massive that even Zuckerberg's come in and thrown in the towel and rolled over, at least on the surface.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.699]  And we're seeing populists being elected everywhere.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.320]  How would you quantify the historic moment we're in right now, General Flynn?
[00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:18.889]  The fact that Elon is coming out, because I've been following Elon for a long time, as I've followed you and Joe Rogan as well, but Elon, I've been following for quite a while, you know, partly because of all the things that he has done or said or achieved in his life.
[00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:25.889]  And I think what Elon has finally come to the realization of is that, and he knows this because he knows these people and he knows what their intentions are.
[00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:33.650]  So the fact that Elon's coming out and saying these things, you know, like he says, vote like your life depends on it because it does.
[00:36:33.869 --> 00:36:36.030]  And not just our life, but our country.
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:44.599]  And the future of really sovereign nations like the United States of America, the future of our Constitution, the future of generations to come.
[00:36:45.039 --> 00:36:47.760]  General Flynn, what you're saying is so incredibly important.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.239]  It's great to see your face, but let us just call you back on the phone.
[00:36:50.539 --> 00:36:54.059]  We're going to call you back because what you're saying is too important, and it's not, you know, seeing your face we need.
[00:36:54.099 --> 00:36:55.219]  It's just we need to hear from you.
[00:36:55.570 --> 00:37:02.530]  We're good to go.
[00:37:16.889 --> 00:37:20.469]  Right now and talk to General Flynn that way.
[00:37:20.809 --> 00:37:29.650]  While we're doing that, I want to play a clip from James O'Keefe in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the epicenter battleground state that they're so desperately trying to steal.
[00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:33.550]  And you can do this in any blue city, not just in blue states.
[00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:34.730]  You can do this in Austin, Texas.
[00:37:35.389 --> 00:37:38.090]  You can do this in Miami, Florida.
[00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:40.869]  You can do this in...
[00:37:43.389 --> 00:37:43.829]  Utah.
[00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:50.289]  I mean, you can go anywhere, and they'll have NGOs, multiple ones usually, right across the street from polling places.
[00:37:51.429 --> 00:37:55.710]  And they give them a sheet saying that they're authorized to vote.
[00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:57.929]  And they say, oh, it's just a local election.
[00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:01.329]  But then they tell them, no, you can vote in the national election because you live here.
[00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:02.869]  And it's totally illegal.
[00:38:02.869 --> 00:38:03.630]  It's a felony.
[00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:05.369]  But they just do it.
[00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:06.429]  And then they gaslight.
[00:38:06.429 --> 00:38:07.989]  It's been going on for over a decade.
[00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:10.670]  They gaslight and go, no, no, no, that doesn't exist.
[00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:11.650]  That's not happening.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.039]  But now it's out in the open and the federal judges are, yeah, illegals can vote.
[00:38:16.219 --> 00:38:18.900]  So, again, that's being now struck down by the Supreme Court.
[00:38:19.059 --> 00:38:25.980]  So we're forcing the fraud, forcing the debate, getting past the gaslighting part of nobody's teaching your kid to chop their penis off.
[00:38:26.639 --> 00:38:27.840]  Nobody's, you know, devaluing your dollar.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.519]  Nobody's starting World War III. Oh, no, this shot's safe and effective.
[00:38:30.739 --> 00:38:32.039]  Oh, fluoride's good for you.
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.539]  No, that's all over.
[00:38:33.659 --> 00:38:35.360]  People now know it's premeditated evil.
[00:38:35.539 --> 00:38:36.539]  They're out to get us.
[00:38:36.659 --> 00:38:41.659]  And now they're trying to turn around like, will O'Keefe be charged for disrupting polling and showing people voting?
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:42.980]  He went to the door.
[00:38:43.159 --> 00:38:44.860]  He had his undercovers go to the door.
[00:38:45.019 --> 00:38:47.360]  And he had them say, yeah, you're not a citizen.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.159]  You can vote.
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:49.980]  Yeah, you can vote.
[00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:56.170]  And that is exposing crime, and he's totally protected.
[00:38:56.289 --> 00:38:58.250]  But I'm sure they'll still indict him, and he'll beat that.
[00:38:58.449 --> 00:39:01.570]  But it'll take you supporting him, just like you gotta support us.
[00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:05.969]  Here is the clip of the amazing work of the great James O'Keefe.
[00:39:06.809 --> 00:39:10.070]  James O'Keefe here in North Philadelphia on Fifth Street.
[00:39:10.309 --> 00:39:15.989]  Right here is the Philadelphia City Commissioner's Office the day before Election Day.
[00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:20.269]  And across the street is an NGO called Saiba.
[00:39:20.809 --> 00:39:21.590]  That's Saiba.
[00:39:22.139 --> 00:39:24.760]  And they are telling people to vote.
[00:39:25.039 --> 00:39:35.679]  They are telling people that all you need is what's called a tin number, that's i-tin number, and you can vote if you're not a citizen of the United States.
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:48.860]  So we sent an undercover reporter to this NGO right across from the place where people are early voting, and she got confirmation that yes, in fact, she can vote with nothing but an i-tin number.
[00:39:57.469 --> 00:40:07.030]  And then we went into the city commissioner's office to speak to the man who works there, working for the city government, confirming that you only need to be a resident of Philadelphia.
[00:40:07.329 --> 00:40:10.989]  But when I say resident, that means of the entire United States.
[00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.269]  But you're just worried about...
[00:40:13.269 --> 00:40:13.269]  Philadelphia.
[00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:15.269]  Oh, you don't care about anything else.
[00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:18.530]  You just want them to have a resident of Philadelphia.
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:22.179]  After that, you confirm that, you register.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.780]  Whether you have a social security number or not, you can vote.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.699]  Obviously, it's extremely loud here.
[00:40:29.119 --> 00:40:30.719]  Music is very loud.
[00:40:31.179 --> 00:40:35.460]  So we're going to go ahead and walk across the street and talk to these people.
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:41.960]  Are you Juliesa?
[00:40:42.739 --> 00:40:44.019]  Are you Juliesa?
[00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:58.070]  And these people over here across the street are saying that you can vote if you have an I-10 number.
[00:40:58.389 --> 00:41:00.269]  This is the document that they gave us.
[00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:05.230]  Once again, I cannot comment because I don't know, no idea.
[00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:10.050]  All right, General Flynn is back with us.
[00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:11.789]  General, you were saying such critical things.
[00:41:11.949 --> 00:41:13.309]  Recap what you said and continue on.
[00:41:13.409 --> 00:41:13.909]  You've got the floor.
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:15.900]  Yeah, so the globalists.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.619]  What I want to do is I want to just give you their battle plan, okay?
[00:41:18.679 --> 00:41:21.800]  The globalists have a couple of things in mind, and they've already begun.
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.679]  They began with the COVID indoctrination, right?
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:38.460]  I mean, the last few years, and the whole thing about the Wuhan virus, the China virus, as Trump calls it, that was intentionally designed to basically determine if they could actually control the world, right?
[00:41:38.579 --> 00:41:39.280]  I mean, and they did.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:43.519]  They used COVID. And the Wuhan virus and China virus to do that.
[00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:44.219]  That's number one.
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:53.960]  That's part of their plan to just determine how far they could actually go to gain some type of leverage over literally the globe.
[00:41:54.099 --> 00:41:55.280]  And they were able to do that.
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.900]  And everybody has experienced that.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.400]  Now, in America, we're not going to be fooled again by that.
[00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:03.889]  You know, but they were able to achieve a modicum of success.
[00:42:03.889 --> 00:42:13.670]  And I can talk to the details of that where, you know, closing down certain churches, closing down small businesses, going after and dividing the people in this country into different camps.
[00:42:13.809 --> 00:42:27.179]  The second thing, and they just finished up, is the BRICS Consortium, which is the Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and many other nations now that are going to change away from the U.S. dollar as the currency of choice.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:36.920]  So this is the economic shift that the globalists want in order to gain control with components like the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, World Health Organization.
[00:42:37.199 --> 00:42:43.780]  Of course, the World Health is tied into the COVID madness that we experienced, but that's part of their plan.
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:52.050]  And then the third thing really is Is this whole thing, and this is why I'm here, is this whole thing about health and human migration, right?
[00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:57.650]  These people believe in mass migration, and they don't care if it's illegal.
[00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:02.369]  Now, I will tell you, Trudeau, Biden, and Oregon are out of Mexico.
[00:43:02.369 --> 00:43:03.690]  He's not in charge in Mexico.
[00:43:03.809 --> 00:43:04.769]  Now, they signed off.
[00:43:04.909 --> 00:43:06.429]  They signed off on a pact.
[00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:08.889]  Most people don't understand what this means.
[00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:13.969]  But basically, a North American pact for human migration where all borders...
[00:43:14.239 --> 00:43:15.219]  Are seamless, right?
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.619]  People can move back and forth.
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:32.869]  So the idea to get after America with so many illegals, and now we're talking, a recent study, and I think it was either out of Yale or Harvard, I believe Yale, recent study that talked about 22 million Illegals are in the United States of America right now.
[00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:46.610]  So the monumental task to not only shut the border down, but to do a deportation of illegals out of this country, particularly the terrorists and the criminals that we know are here, that the Biden administration allowed.
[00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:49.550]  What I want people to understand, those three components, right?
[00:43:49.670 --> 00:44:01.630]  The migration, the illegal migration, the health components, the The economic situation, and then, of course, what they did with the COVID madness, I call it.
[00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:11.769]  It's just a madness, because the globalist's intention is to take our sovereignty away, bring us under a global system of government, where I mentioned some of these organizations.
[00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:17.150]  You know, the World Economic Forum is kind of the command and control headquarters for their battle plans, right?
[00:44:17.269 --> 00:44:20.789]  People like Klaus Schwab, Yuval Noah Harari, and many others.
[00:44:20.849 --> 00:44:22.489]  You got Bill Gates, you got George Soros.
[00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:26.269]  These people You know, this isn't Mike Flynn's conspiracy theory.
[00:44:26.469 --> 00:44:35.150]  These are intentional actions and words that these people have said in various forums over the last probably 10 years.
[00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:47.159]  And now what happened to them, their plan where Obama left office The plan was to have Hillary come in, and we wouldn't be having this conversation, Alex, and to your beautiful audience.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:55.599]  What we'd be talking about is we'd be talking about what levels of socialism would be enforced in our country had we gotten a Hillary Clinton.
[00:44:55.699 --> 00:45:05.320]  But what happened was, and it was a miracle, the miracle was that Donald Trump made the decision back in 2015, summer of 2015, and I met with him actually that summer.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.500]  Where he said, I'm going to run for president of the United States.
[00:45:08.659 --> 00:45:12.860]  And of course, the whole, you know, the whole political world went crazy and said, oh, this guy's a joke.
[00:45:13.099 --> 00:45:14.599]  And Donald Trump won.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.099]  And he won in 2016.
[00:45:16.619 --> 00:45:23.619]  And I feel today, sitting here today, two years or Eight years ago, right?
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:28.900]  I feel very similar to the way I felt on the election day of 2016.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:46.619]  I feel a sense of energy in the country, a sense of renewedness, a sense of sort of refreshment from the people of our country because the thing about the American people and what is still in our And our DNA is something called freedom and liberty.
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:53.119]  And the American people are not about to give that up to some yard birds that are part of this globalist system.
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.800]  And these people are very real.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:59.920]  I mean, I think most of your audience is going to be aware of it because you've been talking about it for so long.
[00:46:00.219 --> 00:46:07.340]  Now, the challenge going forward, and I was saying this, and I'm not sure that it all got picked up because I know we had a bad connection.
[00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:14.630]  But I think it's really important for me to emphasize So I am assuming a victory for Donald Trump, but that doesn't mean you get out of line.
[00:46:14.909 --> 00:46:15.909]  You stay in line and you vote.
[00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:18.750]  And we want to continue to have that overwhelming vote.
[00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:22.329]  But going forward, this is when the real hard work begins.
[00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:25.329]  This is when the real sacrifices are going to begin.
[00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:35.269]  And one of the things that I have continued to emphasize within the Trump camp, particularly with President Donald J. Trump, is his own personal safety.
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:38.300]  These people have already tried to kill him a couple of times.
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:51.739]  And we know that there are foreign elements in place that will work with domestic elements to try to take this man out or try to take members of his family out or D, all of the above.
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.679]  And I mean that and I'm very serious about that.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:04.690]  We are in a completely different time You and I, both in the week before they tried to kill him in July, both said it, so absolutely.
[00:47:05.369 --> 00:47:09.949]  I mean, politically, historically, that's the only move they've got left, basically, so we need to be watching for that.
[00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:16.650]  Now, the other thing is, and here's another piece of history that we are about to go into, okay, because history you always think about in the back.
[00:47:16.969 --> 00:47:28.849]  But going forward, so Donald Trump is going to go into his sentencing hearing on November 26th, okay, in front of this Marchand, this Judge Marchand up in New York, which is in state court.
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:36.179]  And this is going to be interesting because let's assume a big victory tonight, right?
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:46.860]  Now, a couple of weeks later, we have a constitutional process between the election day and when he gets finally confirmed and the Electoral College gets his final vote.
[00:47:47.179 --> 00:47:51.400]  That's like what happened on 6 January of 2020, the setup.
[00:47:52.699 --> 00:47:56.840]  And I put Nancy Pelosi right at the head of that with the likes of people like Obama.
[00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:58.989]  So the setup of January 6th.
[00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:01.309]  So we have a constitutional process we're going to go through.
[00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:11.670]  Well, now the new thing going forward in the historical context is we've never had a president, a former president, convicted of felonies.
[00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:13.829]  And God knows even what these things are about.
[00:48:14.449 --> 00:48:15.789]  And I've studied a lot of this.
[00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:19.250]  I still can't totally tell what he was convicted for.
[00:48:19.389 --> 00:48:21.070]  But he's going to go in front of this judge.
[00:48:21.389 --> 00:48:28.780]  So when he wins today, 26th November, he goes in for sentencing.
[00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:37.500]  If he is elected as the president in the next 24 hours, right, and it comes out that he's an overwhelming victory, what does this judge do?
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:40.099]  And how does the left respond?
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:46.340]  My guess is that they will seriously consider putting this man in jail.
[00:48:46.599 --> 00:48:54.500]  And then what they do, then what the left does, and this is a scenario, Alex, I'm laying out a scenario, a bit of a hypothetical, but I know how these people think.
[00:48:54.750 --> 00:49:10.949]  Because I, you know, I have had to fight these kinds of battles against opposing ideologies in my own experiences, not only as a, you know, on the battlefield, but as a senior intelligence officer in support of big, big strategic issues that this country has been involved in.
[00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:14.469]  So one of the standards is they put this man in jail.
[00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:15.369]  They put him in prison.
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:22.679]  And then what the left does is they go, we can't certify a convicted felon, you know, for president of the United States.
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:27.619]  And they start going rabid crazy, like rabid, like a rabid dog.
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:31.500]  And they start going crazy about how they can't certify this guy.
[00:49:31.699 --> 00:49:33.519]  He's in prison, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.940]  And this is where the American people have to shore up.
[00:49:37.099 --> 00:49:44.510]  And this is why I say, Tactically, we're talking about another two and a half months between now and the inauguration day.
[00:49:44.969 --> 00:49:46.230]  The man has got to stay alive.
[00:49:46.909 --> 00:49:54.849]  Strategically, they are not done because these globalists have not taken us through the likes of Russiagate, impeachment gates.
[00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:56.610]  General Flynn, General Flynn, two minute break.
[00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:57.550]  Stay with us, five more minutes.

[00:52:02.159 --> 00:52:04.079]  Oh, and did I mention orders over $99?
[00:52:04.679 --> 00:52:05.199]  Free shipping.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.420]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[00:52:08.599 --> 00:52:09.820]  It just goes on from there.
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:16.940]  So, theallocshownstore.com forward slash VIP. Or just at the top of theallocshownstore.com, you see the VIP button.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.260]  We're fighting the new world order.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.159]  I don't have millionaire backers.
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:25.860]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:27.300]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[00:52:28.039 --> 00:52:29.019]  Theallowshowstore.com.
[00:52:29.579 --> 00:52:35.320]  It's up to you whether you want to back The number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:44.619]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:51.880]  And I just don't know why I'm this lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[00:52:52.019 --> 00:52:54.019]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[00:52:54.539 --> 00:52:56.980]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.199]  We've already...
[00:52:59.079 --> 00:53:00.179]  Just devastated them.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:03.340]  I mean, world government, the New World Orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[00:53:03.579 --> 00:53:04.900]  The whole world's turning against them.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:09.179]  They're super dangerous as they're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:19.860]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've understood, that I should let these Criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[00:53:20.199 --> 00:53:21.659]  So, again, I don't give up.
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:24.519]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[00:53:24.739 --> 00:53:28.179]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:30.639]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[00:53:30.739 --> 00:53:32.119]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:40.820]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over the social credit score and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[00:53:41.019 --> 00:53:45.820]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:49.190]  And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:51.670]  I mean, it's just...
[00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:53.030]  This is a joke.
[00:53:53.289 --> 00:53:54.510]  This is ridiculous.
[00:53:54.909 --> 00:53:56.050]  We're changing the world.
[00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:59.030]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[00:53:59.489 --> 00:54:03.369]  It is election day, the day of doom for the globalists.
[00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:07.670]  2024, as Trump said Sunday in a speech in Pennsylvania, nine years of struggle.
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.400]  To engage these people in these battles.
[00:54:10.579 --> 00:54:14.079]  But we are very close to winning the war today.
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:16.159]  The war to get him in.
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:19.159]  Then the real war starts to keep him alive.
[00:54:19.159 --> 00:54:22.360]  To get him in office on the 20th of January.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.320]  And to good people in the government.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.539]  And to restore the republic.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:31.219]  And to put us back on a path of the great nation.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.260]  The greatest nation in the history of the world that we were.
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:35.000]  As a city on the hill.
[00:54:35.099 --> 00:54:35.880]  A light to the world.
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:37.719]  General Flynn...
[00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:41.929]  Who was the main enemy of the globalists when Trump first got in 2016.
[00:54:41.929 --> 00:54:47.489]  His main advisor is here now breaking down the globalist plan.
[00:54:47.730 --> 00:55:00.869]  And before he went to break, he'd just gotten up to the point of explaining that he believes, and I believe we're about to win today, or in the next few weeks even if it's disputed, but then the enemy is going to strike back.
[00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:03.329]  It's key to start getting into that battle space.
[00:55:03.469 --> 00:55:04.389]  General Flynn, finish up.
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:05.099]  Right.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:09.340]  So on the battlefield, we talk about fighting through the objective, right?
[00:55:09.559 --> 00:55:12.400]  So I give somebody an objective, take that hill.
[00:55:12.639 --> 00:55:17.960]  And what I want them to do is I not only want them to take that hill, but I want them to fight through the hill.
[00:55:18.059 --> 00:55:22.980]  I want them to go to the other side, and I want them to continue to crush the enemy that we are facing.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:28.500]  And so tonight, we're going to put nails into the coffin of the globalists, right?
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:30.599]  And this is very, very real.
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:40.019]  But what we have to understand, to your great, wonderful audience, and many, many others that will hear this, is we have to fight all the way through this objective.
[00:55:40.139 --> 00:55:50.460]  That means we have to continue To keep that message alive, to keep the idea of what it means to be an American, what it means to have the liberties that we have.
[00:55:50.679 --> 00:55:53.019]  These people will not go away.
[00:55:53.159 --> 00:56:08.409]  If we don't fight through the objective, if we don't achieve what it is that we need to achieve today, which is a victory, For Donald J. Trump to be the next president of the United States, now what we're going to have to do is fight through that objective and go to the other side and start attacking down the hill.
[00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:12.469]  Chase them back through the gates of hell, if you will.
[00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:16.769]  And that's something that we're going to have to do because they are not going to suddenly go away.
[00:56:16.949 --> 00:56:24.420]  These are not people that will easily give in and they will have other What we call in the military, branches and sequels.
[00:56:24.539 --> 00:56:29.579]  They're going to have other ways to fight back, and they're going to try different ways.
[00:56:29.739 --> 00:56:36.400]  And I do believe, one of them that I said earlier, Alex, is this idea of going after this man physically.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:41.920]  I mean, the spiritual nature of the war that we are in, this is clearly a good versus evil.
[00:56:42.179 --> 00:56:48.530]  And America, you know, for the For the most part of our 250 years, we've been a good nation.
[00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:49.650]  We are a humble nation.
[00:56:49.769 --> 00:56:50.929]  We are a courageous nation.
[00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:52.070]  We have courageous people.
[00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:54.150]  We are the most giving nation on the planet.
[00:56:54.289 --> 00:57:06.710]  And we can continue to be that way with the right leadership instead of taking and taking and taking from the people of our country and giving it away to people who don't deserve it, frankly, in many cases.
[00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:12.949]  So the plans that they have, that our opposition has, are many.
[00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:14.590]  And we have to be ready for them.
[00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:18.849]  And this is why I say, and I kind of take a deep breath here.
[00:57:18.889 --> 00:57:20.369]  I want people to understand me.
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:25.460]  You know, feel good about a victory because we are going to achieve a victory.
[00:57:25.639 --> 00:57:26.380]  Feel good about it.
[00:57:26.619 --> 00:57:37.239]  But now take a deep breath and let's get to where we start to feel very, you know, we really start to focus and we start to say, okay, what's next?
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:40.659]  And we start to look at what's next and we start to take action for what's next.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:58:00.699]  That means those people that are operating at the local level that have been a big, big We have somebody to the north in Trudeau.
[00:58:02.019 --> 00:58:05.920]  You know, sort of a growth in communism to our south in Mexico.
[00:58:06.219 --> 00:58:20.420]  We have the Chinese, you know, and this government is not going to, our current government does not talk about the Chinese infiltration into every segment of our country, all the institutions, whether it's education or whether it's our government.
[00:58:20.579 --> 00:58:28.019]  And the Chinese are part of this force, this enemy formation that we are facing.
[00:58:28.019 --> 00:58:33.230]  And the Chinese work very closely with the Mexican cartels, and they, And look at Walls.
[00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:34.630]  Look at Walls as an open agent.
[00:58:34.769 --> 00:58:37.349]  General Flynn, you're going to give us more updates.
[00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:38.070]  God bless you.
[00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:38.929]  We'll talk to you soon.
[00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:40.210]  We'll call you back later today.
[00:58:40.389 --> 00:58:40.730]  Thank you.
[00:58:40.869 --> 00:58:41.570]  God bless, Alex.
[00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:41.949]  Thank you.
[00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:42.949]  Great audience, too.
[00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.670]  Thank you, General.
[00:58:43.769 --> 00:58:44.349]  Yes, they're the best.
[00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:45.670]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:45.809 --> 00:58:46.949]  That's what the globalist hates, our audience.
[00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:47.489]  Thank you, General.
[00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:51.210]  You heard General Flynn just five minutes ago.
[00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:54.829]  He feels a disturbance in the force.
[00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:57.329]  Big time victory, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:58.429 --> 00:59:00.329]  That's what my gut tells me as well.
[00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:01.809]  And it's never been wrong.
[00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:08.489]  But that's the victory of America waking up at a total cultural, spiritual realignment.
[00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:15.389]  We're vomiting up the satanic poison of Hollywood and the pedo gates and the Jeffrey Epstein's and the P. Diddy's and all of it.
[00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:19.969]  We've massively turned the corner, but that doesn't mean they won't kill Trump.
[00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:22.769]  That doesn't mean they won't knock out the power and blame Russia.
[00:59:23.929 --> 00:59:27.869]  That doesn't mean they won't stage a mass shooting of a black church or college and blame it on Trump.
[00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:32.230]  That doesn't mean they won't try to steal this thing which they're doing.
[00:59:32.469 --> 00:59:52.949]  And how many times did I tell you till your ears bled in the last few years and a crescendo in the last few weeks with guests like the professor we're about to talk to that they say white supremacists are going to mass shoot and bomb and blow the power out in a disputed election.
[00:59:54.070 --> 01:00:03.489]  And then they bust this guy in Tennessee that they've been watching forever with huge public dossiers on him by the NGOs, by the Southern Property Law Center and others.
[01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:04.289]  I've got them right here.
[01:00:04.469 --> 01:00:05.570]  We'll show them to you on screen.
[01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:07.329]  They give him the bomb.
[01:00:07.329 --> 01:00:08.489]  He goes out with the drone.
[01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:12.710]  He's got confidential human informants and sources that handle him.
[01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:14.170]  And then they stop him in the act.
[01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:17.269]  So I believe they can say, oh, we stopped this one.
[01:00:17.389 --> 01:00:18.489]  Sorry, we didn't stop the other ones.
[01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:19.170]  And now...
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:26.880]  The Feds are running around saying the Russians are involved and the Russians are doing bomb threats.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.639]  Remember Vault 7, Edward Snowden?
[01:00:31.059 --> 01:00:35.639]  The documents where the CIA goes and takes over foreign computers and attacks us and blames it?
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:41.980]  Remember Hillary said that if any foreign attack by cyber happened by Russia, we would nuke them?
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.079]  So...
[01:00:47.309 --> 01:00:47.969]  It's on.
[01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:53.429]  Georgia Secretary of State claims that bomb threats to two Georgia polling stations originated in Russia.
[01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:56.730]  They are pre-programming it now.
[01:00:56.730 --> 01:00:59.849]  We'll play the video coming up here in a moment.
[01:01:00.849 --> 01:01:02.510]  Breaking election terror alert.
[01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:07.929]  As predicted by me, a right-wing terrorist has been caught trying to blow up the Tennessee power grid.
[01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:11.650]  Plus, Elon Musk warns X will be shut down under a Harris-Waltz administration.
[01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:16.190]  White supremacists plan to blow up an electricity station using drone-laden explosives.
[01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:19.150]  When you read the federal press release, they admit they handled him.
[01:01:19.289 --> 01:01:19.889]  They ran him.
[01:01:20.269 --> 01:01:22.289]  The standard MO will put that press release on screen.
[01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:24.909]  But joining us is Dr.
[01:01:25.369 --> 01:01:33.949]  Darren J. Beattie, Revolver.News, the January 6th expert, totally vindicated, Elon Musk and...
[01:01:35.179 --> 01:01:39.159]  Rogan yesterday saying, yeah, just like they staged January 6th.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.840]  Just like Alex Jones was right.
[01:01:41.659 --> 01:01:42.440]  That's big.
[01:01:42.659 --> 01:01:43.800]  You're like, we already know all this.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:44.900]  Now it's Elon Musk.
[01:01:45.039 --> 01:01:45.840]  Now it's Joe Rogan.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.320]  Seismic.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.320]  Musk saying, the new world order is unelected.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.480]  Global government's your enemy.
[01:01:51.599 --> 01:01:52.539]  They want to enslave you.
[01:01:52.719 --> 01:01:53.960]  Your future hangs in the balance.
[01:01:54.159 --> 01:01:56.000]  Word for word what I say, because it's true.
[01:01:57.119 --> 01:02:01.699]  So, this is massive.
[01:02:03.369 --> 01:02:05.570]  But the enemy is going to pull something big.
[01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:07.949]  So give us a 35,000 foot view.
[01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:08.849]  Dr.
[01:02:08.869 --> 01:02:11.369]  Beatty, of course, has been a top advisor to Trump, speech writer, you name it.
[01:02:11.869 --> 01:02:13.289]  One of our big brains.
[01:02:13.869 --> 01:02:20.329]  If he was one of the creatures in the Starship Troopers, he'd be the brain bug.
[01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:25.530]  So brain bug, what is, I mean that affectionately, what do you see happening?
[01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:27.150]  The telltale pre-programming.
[01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:29.250]  What's your view on what's taking place right now?
[01:02:31.329 --> 01:02:39.269]  Well, there's a lot going on, as you say, and I was extremely encouraged, as you were, to see Rogan and Musk talking about January 6th.
[01:02:39.369 --> 01:02:49.769]  In fact, there's a clip that I imagine you've seen as well, and a lot of your viewers may have seen, is Elon Musk was asked directly not just about January 6th, but about the pipe bomb.
[01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:58.150]  To which he responded that in all likelihood it was the pipe bomber is a government informant or government employee.
[01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:12.360]  And so the Fed's erection lie that we've been reporting on, that you've been reporting on, that we've been talking about for so long, Really reached escape velocity, so to speak.
[01:03:12.519 --> 01:03:20.619]  It's not just something that Trump knows about, not just something Rogan knows about, Elon knows about it, and the American public know about it.
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:27.820]  And it's important because they're still trying to use January 6th as this pretext to get rid of Trump.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:32.239]  I'm sure you've spoken about this nut job called Raskin.
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:38.800]  And Raskin's whole plan, he's propounded this theory recently in a variety of venues.
[01:03:39.039 --> 01:03:43.920]  His working assumption is that Trump is constitutionally unqualified to be president.
[01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:46.969]  And therefore, why even bother having an election?
[01:03:47.269 --> 01:04:01.869]  But just, you know, if they're not able to steal it immediately, he's proposing we're just not going to certify the result because the Supreme Court abdicated its duty in this case by not ruling Trump ineligible.
[01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:14.710]  And so we as Congress, this is Raskin speaking, it's incumbent upon us to To usurp the constitutional mandate by refusing to certify Trump under any circumstances.
[01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:21.079]  And he fully entertains the possibility that this could result in Quote-unquote civil war-like conditions.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:45.920]  I think this is a somewhat remote possibility, but it just goes to show how much the regime still leans on this fake January 6 Fed surrection nonsense for all of their sort of extracurricular ideas on how to subvert and overturn Trump's presidency and undermine the energies beneath it.
[01:04:46.039 --> 01:04:46.300]  Well, that's right.
[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:46.800]  Let's be clear.
[01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:50.730]  As you postulated four years ago, it's all been documented.
[01:04:50.949 --> 01:04:52.510]  The whole thing hinges on that.
[01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:54.750]  The pipe bomb was set up by the feds.
[01:04:54.889 --> 01:04:57.409]  The police staged discovery, and it's all on video.
[01:04:57.610 --> 01:04:58.010]  It's come out.
[01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:59.769]  Now it's hit escape velocity.
[01:05:00.389 --> 01:05:03.610]  Now Elon Musk and Rogan are saying Alex Jones is right.
[01:05:03.809 --> 01:05:08.070]  That's just a touchstone zeitgeist that they're coming out against fluoride in the water.
[01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:09.449]  They're going to ban the poison shots.
[01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:12.650]  We have reached, not just on that topic, escape velocity.
[01:05:12.929 --> 01:05:16.909]  The grand awakening, the finale of exploding...
[01:05:17.779 --> 01:05:21.019]  The dam that's been holding back the truth has happened.
[01:05:21.239 --> 01:05:27.880]  But if we don't think Skynet's not going to send back a Terminator to try to derail this, we're stupid.
[01:05:28.099 --> 01:05:32.340]  So how do they grab victory from the jaws of defeat?
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.699]  Because that's all they're thinking about.
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:34.719]  That's all they're doing.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.639]  And so, yeah, we see the mass awakening.
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:37.199]  We're celebrating.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:37.800]  We can feel it.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:38.420]  We can see it.
[01:05:38.559 --> 01:05:40.099]  They're being caught in election fraud everywhere.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.340]  Everything's blowing up in their faces.
[01:05:41.619 --> 01:05:43.980]  But we know these people, they don't give up.
[01:05:44.429 --> 01:05:50.969]  We've seen some capitulation on their side by Zuckerberg and others, so do you agree they're going to pull some shenanigans and what are those, Doctor?
[01:05:52.059 --> 01:05:53.639]  I think they're going to be very desperate.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.280]  First of all, I just want to say we can entertain.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:58.099]  It's absolutely appropriate to do that.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:08.940]  All of the things that the regime might do in the interim between basically the election day today and the inauguration should we get the result that we want.
[01:06:09.139 --> 01:06:25.380]  But even as we entertain these possibilities, I think it's imperative to remind the audience and the audience to remind everyone you know First things first, let's make sure we've all voted and everyone we know, assuming that they think the right way politically and are going to vote for Trump,
[01:06:25.719 --> 01:06:31.539]  make sure they go to the poll because the steal presupposes the win.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:36.019]  We need to get the win first before we can fight off the steal.
[01:06:36.199 --> 01:06:44.960]  So that's number one, first and foremost, go and vote and tell everyone you know who's going to vote for Trump, go vote as well.
[01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:46.769]  Absolutely critical.
[01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:49.849]  Then we've got this and then we can worry about the steel.
[01:06:50.030 --> 01:07:15.750]  As for how the steel might take place, how the undermining might take place, there's a variety of tools that the regime has from the sort of more exotic and perhaps remote possibilities entertained by Raskin to I think we can fully expect a barrage of lawfare related to contested states if it looks like It's going in the direction the regime doesn't like.
[01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:17.230]  Oh, they've already pledged to do that.
[01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:18.849]  Elias and all of them are already doing it.
[01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:19.789]  Absolutely.
[01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:21.949]  So that's just baked into the cake.
[01:07:22.610 --> 01:07:29.690]  As for what they're going to do with Trump, they've already showed, and we're talking about January 6th and these other things.
[01:07:29.889 --> 01:07:35.329]  I think one thing that's so encouraging is that Elon himself is fully unleashed.
[01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:40.170]  I think that Elon is going to keep pushing when Trump wins.
[01:07:41.239 --> 01:07:59.980]  Elon is going to make sure that we get to the bottom of these things that we need to get to the bottom of, including The assassination attempts on Trump, which I think if there's one thing that's going to be a bigger scandal, then the pipe bomb is going to be uncovering the actual truth about the assassination attempts.
[01:08:00.219 --> 01:08:02.420]  So that's going to be huge.
[01:08:02.559 --> 01:08:18.470]  I think that level of desperation that we saw in Butler, we might unfortunately see that same desperation because I think what's happening at the bird's eye level is You have a different situation from 2016 and 2020.
[01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:30.770]  In 2016 and 2020, it's fair to say that there was full spectrum consensus across all the stakeholders in the regime that Trump is an existential threat.
[01:08:31.069 --> 01:08:50.720]  Now, I think the dam has broken to the point where you have major players, people like Elon, and there's even a softening with, you know, Bezos at least took the step that's significant, if not, you know, It's not everything, but it's a positive and encouraging first step to have the Washington Post not to endorse Kamala,
[01:08:50.779 --> 01:08:53.279]  which has been the first time in a very long time.
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.279]  That's encouraging.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.079]  You brought up Zuckerberg.
[01:08:56.199 --> 01:08:58.279]  And so there's a dam is broken.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:11.699]  By Elon acquiring Twitter and very much being the man in the arena this session has created kind of preference cascade across a certain sector of the tech and even business elite.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:20.560]  I think that's incredibly significant because it means there's no longer this I think?
[01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:40.449]  I was about to say, they've been caught in so many lies and so many hoaxes that none of it's going to work now.
[01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:42.189]  So all they've got left is what?
[01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:43.069]  Assassination?
[01:09:43.569 --> 01:09:45.529]  Or trigger such a giant war?
[01:09:45.729 --> 01:09:47.689]  Or collapse the economy and blame Trump?
[01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:50.010]  I mean, again...
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:10:06.260]  Nothing they're doing is working, and it's accelerating into, quite frankly, good thing Trump is a good guy, just wants to stabilize things, because their attempts to do all this to him, if he wanted to come in and become a dictator and actually, you know, do all this stuff, he could do it.
[01:10:06.319 --> 01:10:07.020]  It's not going to happen.
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:09.859]  But, I mean, they have really roused the public.
[01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:11.619]  And, again, it's exponential.
[01:10:11.699 --> 01:10:12.619]  I'm seeing it.
[01:10:12.819 --> 01:10:13.939]  This is getting wild-eyed.
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.680]  I mean, the globalists really push too far.
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:18.100]  Yeah, I mean, and the thing is...
[01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:26.750]  You know, on one hand, the anti-Trump forces are much weaker because there's not this full spectrum regime-wide consensus.
[01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:32.869]  But on the other side, the weaker they are now, in some ways, the more dangerous they are because they're desperate.
[01:10:33.149 --> 01:10:37.109]  And I think that's really behind what you saw in Butler.
[01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:39.050]  It was a desperate act.
[01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:40.569]  It was an extreme act.
[01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:47.069]  It's what the regime does When they no longer have censorship at their disposal, they can't...
[01:10:47.069 --> 01:10:49.670]  You know, 2020 was a high-water mark for censorship.
[01:10:50.170 --> 01:10:52.850]  With Elon changed that whole dynamic.
[01:10:54.189 --> 01:11:09.270]  2016 was a high-water mark for the efficacy of these reputation-damaging weapons like calling someone racist, getting fired from their jobs, this so-called cancellation approach.
[01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:10.689]  That still happens.
[01:11:12.099 --> 01:11:13.420]  Yeah, they're out of bullets.
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.380]  They're out of bullets.
[01:11:14.479 --> 01:11:15.600]  The bullying backfired.
[01:11:15.779 --> 01:11:18.840]  But you're the real expert on false flags and leptis garbage.
[01:11:18.899 --> 01:11:20.899]  And I'm, quite frankly, an expert too.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.979]  I researched it and lived it and been through it.
[01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:26.939]  What do you make up of them pre-programming that we're all white supremacists going to kill everybody?
[01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:32.989]  And then clearly then provocateuring people, which we just saw with the Tennessee guy trying to blow up the power station.
[01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:36.590]  I mean, to me, that's one of the other big cards they've still got left.
[01:11:36.649 --> 01:11:39.289]  And then if they do play that, how does that get blamed on Trump?
[01:11:39.550 --> 01:11:41.609]  What do they use that for to trigger riots?
[01:11:42.489 --> 01:11:44.010]  They tried to wind this guy up.
[01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:49.430]  They admit in their own press release to shoot up black people, but they couldn't get him to do that.
[01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:51.890]  So, I mean, I don't think we're out of the woods yet.
[01:11:52.399 --> 01:11:54.560]  No, we're not out of the woods by any stretch.
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:12:02.100]  Again, the desperate animal in this case, the regime is going to be the most dangerous in some key respects.
[01:12:02.279 --> 01:12:17.250]  And so we should fully expect or at least be prepared for something like the false flag, something, God forbid, like We're good to go.
[01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:36.170]  We're good to go.
[01:12:53.849 --> 01:12:57.789]  I think the regime is in a very...
[01:12:58.889 --> 01:12:59.989]  Desperate place.
[01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:16.250]  If I were them, if I were thinking as them, I think their best shot is to outright steal it, do whatever they need to do to get the electoral vote victory today, tomorrow, in the coming days.
[01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:25.710]  So I think all of these approaches to steal after the fact have greatly diminished in terms of their expected efficacy.
[01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:28.409]  Dead on.
[01:13:28.829 --> 01:13:31.250]  So what else would you impart to us?
[01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:34.310]  And then hopefully this evening and tomorrow as this unfolds, you can pop back in with us.
[01:13:34.369 --> 01:13:38.989]  You just tell us the times and we'll work you in for a quick five minute, ten minute hit with your knowledge.
[01:13:39.529 --> 01:13:41.270]  Because folks, most of you know this.
[01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:42.250]  This guy knows what he's talking about.
[01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:44.770]  Because all I do is research this and I learn stuff from this guy every day.
[01:13:45.029 --> 01:13:50.090]  What else is on your radar screen and what other wild card should we be looking for from the enemy?
[01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:55.270]  Well, again, I mean, this is kind of a pedestrian and boring answer.
[01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:59.930]  But I think the first things first is we just need to get out there and win it today.
[01:14:00.409 --> 01:14:01.909]  That's the number one thing.
[01:14:02.069 --> 01:14:04.710]  And just conventionally look where things go.
[01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:08.590]  Obviously, there are, you know, there's a whole other game to be played.
[01:14:08.909 --> 01:14:20.750]  After that, and I think even when we get the victory, which I hope and expect we will, there needs to be, you know, we've had a reckoning with the censorship industrial complex.
[01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:23.250]  I think Elon is on board with this too.
[01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:39.350]  There needs to be a reckoning with the election industrial complex because even if Trump wins, again, which we all hope and I expect, Our voting system, the way we do elections, it is not sustainable.
[01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:40.750]  It is not tenable.
[01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:53.350]  It needs a complete audit, overhaul, and reckoning such that this is the last election that is manifestly ridiculous in the way that really only the United States elections are.
[01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:56.630]  This has to be the last one that we run this way.
[01:14:56.770 --> 01:15:02.909]  It's simply insane how easy it is for people, whoever they are, to go in and vote, vote multiple times.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:24.739]  Well, I mean, look at the James O'Keefe video in Philadelphia where they have the NGO giving them forms saying you're allowed to vote and then the election officials say come on in and vote.
[01:15:24.859 --> 01:15:25.560]  It doesn't matter if you're a citizen.
[01:15:25.779 --> 01:15:28.279]  I mean, we got federal judges ruling illegals can vote.
[01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:46.710]  Election integrity is like, I hate to even use the word democracy because it's been so raped and plundered by the corrupt trash that run our country, but the election integrity is to democracy like border security is to the country.
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:55.159]  If we don't have real election integrity, if our elections continue to be a joke, it's not going to matter.
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:59.199]  Just like if we continue to not have borders, we don't have a country.
[01:15:59.399 --> 01:16:01.699]  If we don't have borders, we don't have a country.
[01:16:01.899 --> 01:16:19.039]  And if we don't have election integrity, we're never going to have true rule of the people, for the people, even if we're able to win by virtue of Trump's exceptional campaigning and the fact that people are fed up With the elites right now.
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:30.380]  It's simply something we have to do, and I hope that's going to be a major priority going forward into what's hopefully Trump's second term in the White House coming up soon.
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.100]  Quickly, final question.
[01:16:32.479 --> 01:16:35.579]  Let's say we're able to overpower this and get in, which I see happening.
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.020]  It's just gut level, it's so massive.
[01:16:37.279 --> 01:16:39.199]  And there are frauds getting caught everywhere, as you said.
[01:16:39.579 --> 01:16:41.619]  That's all accelerating the awakening process.
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:49.800]  So they're burning themselves down even faster, trying to hold on to power instead of being smart and kind of reclusing back and sneaking back and just trying to hang on.
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:50.739]  They're going to lose it all.
[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:56.220]  Once he's president-elect, though, in those 76 days, that's when the real fiasco begins.
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:59.199]  And so we're winning a major battle, but we haven't won the war.
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:01.300]  100 percent.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:03.439]  And that's why we need to be very attentive.
[01:17:03.439 --> 01:17:07.079]  I hope Trump's people has the lawyers they need.
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:12.579]  And again, I'm encouraged by the fact that Elon couldn't be more in the arena.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.439]  He has a lot at stake here.
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:15.560]  It's not just for the country.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:17.140]  Elon himself, there's a lot at stake.
[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:18.039]  And that's a good thing.
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:19.619]  He's got skin in the game.
[01:17:19.779 --> 01:17:27.380]  A lot of these people in the tech world who have publicly supported Trump, they all have skin in the game now because they have a target on their back.
[01:17:28.199 --> 01:17:30.180]  God forbid Kamala should win.
[01:17:30.319 --> 01:17:41.979]  And so I think and hope we're going to have the resources we need to fight that battle on the legal terrain and also to keep Trump and J.D. safe in this interim period.
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:51.420]  Doctor, everybody should bookmark it, revolver.news, some of the best information that then moves the needle and wakes people up.
[01:17:51.479 --> 01:18:02.159]  Really a blueprint for Trump and the good folks we have in Congress exposing the deep state and their activities and neutralizing the lie of January 6th that is now household information that it was a staged provocateur event.
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:03.640]  We'll talk to you again, sir.
[01:18:03.779 --> 01:18:04.180]  God bless.
[01:18:05.279 --> 01:18:05.899]  Bless you.
[01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:06.340]  Thank you.
[01:18:07.050 --> 01:18:10.470]  Guys, if I don't want to come on tonight, we're going to go right through the evening.
[01:18:10.710 --> 01:18:11.750]  Massive guest everywhere.
[01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:18.670]  We've got a great lawyer, great political pundit, Viva Fry, joining us coming up next segment.
[01:18:18.789 --> 01:18:23.130]  We'll get into so much other news, but you talk about skin in the game, baby.
[01:18:23.890 --> 01:18:24.970]  Trump's got it in the game.
[01:18:25.289 --> 01:18:26.449]  I've got it in the game.
[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:39.239]  My crew has it in the game, and I am 100% committed to justice and the truth, and I have seen God work through our operation and your support, and I know our most important work is to come.
[01:18:39.579 --> 01:18:42.000]  So I need your support now.
[01:18:42.319 --> 01:18:44.760]  We need funds now, plus I make it easy.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:50.060]  Go to our great sponsor right here in Central Texas, my dad's supplement company, and get the amazing supplements.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:55.000]  Finally, some of the amazing new supplements are coming in.
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:58.539]  Everybody needs high-quality quercetin.
[01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:01.119]  Everybody needs high-quality CoQ10.
[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:03.960]  I don't need to explain to you why they're so great.
[01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:07.180]  These are organic, the highest quality, strong doses of it.
[01:19:07.319 --> 01:19:12.720]  It's good for your whole body with all the crazy viruses and the weird mutations and the crap going on.
[01:19:13.119 --> 01:19:17.260]  Everybody in the fall and winter needs to be on quercetin, and you need to be on CoQ10.
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.300]  It cleans out your cells, great for your immune system.
[01:19:19.479 --> 01:19:20.199]  It's amazing.
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:22.539]  Quercetin, incredible documented antidepressants.
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:29.840]  We're good to go.
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:35.800]  We're good to go.
[01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:52.630]  We're good to go.
[01:19:52.770 --> 01:20:07.210]  We're good to go.
[01:20:09.949 --> 01:20:15.989]  That we've got sponsors to continue on and be able to stay on air.
[01:20:16.409 --> 01:20:17.649]  They're great products.
[01:20:17.789 --> 01:20:18.189]  You need them.
[01:20:18.329 --> 01:20:19.229]  I'm asking for your help.
[01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:20.069]  Take action.
[01:20:20.529 --> 01:20:21.710]  Vote with your money.
[01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:22.909]  Vote for Trump.
[01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:24.430]  Vote in the info war.
[01:20:24.609 --> 01:20:31.390]  They're trying to take out their most hated broadcasts because we exposed the whole paradigm and wrote the talking points for everybody else.
[01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:34.630]  It's recognized because we're on it because our talking points are accurate.
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:36.520]  They hate my guts.
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.199]  And boy, do they hate the fact you keep me on air.
[01:20:38.279 --> 01:20:39.939]  They are so pissed when you support us.
[01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:42.039]  You see the leftist lawyers on TV don't support him.
[01:20:42.119 --> 01:20:42.600]  He's going down.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.100]  You're the reason we're here.
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:45.119]  I'm in your hands.
[01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:46.500]  I'm only on air because of you.
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:51.399]  Go now to drjonesnactuals.com to get Corseton Max and...
[01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:53.300]  CoQ10 Pro.

[01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:56.760]  These are high-end quality at low prices.
[01:20:57.260 --> 01:20:59.840]  You pay double to get this type of quality anywhere else.

[01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:03.279]  drjonesdactyls.com.

[01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:24.229]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I say I'm excited about bringing you the ultimate gut cleanse, exclusively available at thealexjohnstore.com, I'm not joking around.
[01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:27.729]  We don't sit there and shoot in the dark.
[01:21:28.029 --> 01:21:38.470]  We go out and we find what are already the best-selling, highest-rated products in the country, and we say, hey, we'd like to private label it, but we'd like you to make it a little bit stronger for us so it's proprietary.
[01:21:39.029 --> 01:21:40.289]  You got it right here.
[01:21:40.949 --> 01:21:42.090]  The ultimate gut cleanse.
[01:21:42.210 --> 01:21:43.810]  This is not just a gut cleanse.
[01:21:44.170 --> 01:21:45.310]  It's not just a detox.
[01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:48.590]  It doesn't just have natural ingredients that gently get rid of parasites.
[01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:49.930]  Oh, it's got that covered.
[01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:57.289]  It's then got a whole bunch of stuff in it like saw palmetto that's good for all your glands and even the government admits great for men's prostates.
[01:21:57.609 --> 01:21:59.510]  And it goes on and on.
[01:21:59.710 --> 01:22:01.189]  I cannot read all the ingredients.
[01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:02.350]  They're concentrated.
[01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:03.430]  They're incredible.
[01:22:03.710 --> 01:22:08.890]  You want to get it right now at thealexjonesstore.com for between 30 and 50% off.
[01:22:09.010 --> 01:22:12.229]  50% off for you to the combo and get it with the Ultimate Probiotic.
[01:22:13.210 --> 01:22:21.989]  It is 1233 Central Standard Time on Tuesday, November 5th, 2024.
[01:22:22.289 --> 01:22:25.390]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:44.960]  And my 30 years of work in the trenches with you against the globalists is really coming in to a spectacular political realignment.
[01:22:45.699 --> 01:22:48.859]  I want to make a prediction right now.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.439]  Trump is set to have a historic victory.
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.319]  They're going to try to contest it.
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.239]  They're going to try to kill him again.
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:01.000]  They're going to create pretexts and excuses for the left to riot.
[01:23:02.539 --> 01:23:07.859]  It's going to be absolutely insane for the next 76 days after he is president-elect.
[01:23:10.239 --> 01:23:13.079]  But the fraud is not going to work.
[01:23:13.159 --> 01:23:28.739]  And when I saw this meme image today that's posted at Real Alex Jones, I said, this is a graphic image that That accurately depicts my prediction for the 2024 election.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:33.899]  This represents my 2024 election outcome prediction.
[01:23:34.859 --> 01:23:37.319]  They are going to try the exact same thing.
[01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:40.920]  You'll see the same graph, but it will not go past the red line.
[01:23:41.819 --> 01:23:44.100]  It'll be a lot closer than it's depicted here.
[01:23:44.239 --> 01:23:46.359]  That's the reality of what's going to happen.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:49.039]  But it will not defeat Trump.
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:50.920]  It will not defeat America.
[01:23:52.699 --> 01:24:03.100]  If they are crazy enough to openly call it early like Fox did four years ago and steal it, it blows up even bigger in their face down the road.
[01:24:03.279 --> 01:24:08.140]  But you already see capitulations by a lot of the Silicon Valley people.
[01:24:08.859 --> 01:24:09.960]  Not just Zuckerberg.
[01:24:10.239 --> 01:24:11.840]  They know the writings on the wall.
[01:24:12.039 --> 01:24:18.859]  Republican Congress folks that are very respected have said they've already seen it circulating that they're getting ready to try to impeach him as soon as he's in.
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.039]  They plan riots once he's president-elect.
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:37.210]  We're not out of the woods yet, but the big battle to wake people up and to have them rebel against the system mentally and not be bullied and not let the left in Hollywood program you And control you and dictate to you and bully you is over.
[01:24:37.409 --> 01:24:38.310]  And it's global.
[01:24:38.970 --> 01:24:54.010]  The tide turned a few years ago, but now the giant waves of awakening are smashing the globalist system into little pieces of driftwood.
[01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:56.409]  Now, they're going to strike back.
[01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:58.909]  But you can see it.
[01:24:59.010 --> 01:24:59.930]  You can feel it.
[01:25:00.130 --> 01:25:02.210]  You are living an incredible history.
[01:25:03.450 --> 01:25:05.090]  Trump says, yeah, we're going to ban fluoride in the water.
[01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:07.369]  Yeah, we're going to get all the vaccines and ban the ones that hurt people.
[01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:07.949]  Well, they all do.
[01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:08.529]  None of them work.
[01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:09.170]  There are no vaccines.
[01:25:10.170 --> 01:25:17.989]  They're in Congress today trying to pass laws to have genetically modified lettuce and tomatoes that makes you take, quote, vaccines that aren't even vaccines.
[01:25:17.989 --> 01:25:19.069]  We'll cover that in a moment.
[01:25:19.369 --> 01:25:21.210]  But it's all coming out.
[01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:22.810]  It's all being exposed.
[01:25:23.529 --> 01:25:25.930]  Viva Frye is a lawyer.
[01:25:26.109 --> 01:25:30.329]  He's also a popular analyst and talk show host with the great Robert Barnes.
[01:25:30.369 --> 01:25:34.050]  And he'll be popping back in with us throughout this evening and tomorrow.
[01:25:34.109 --> 01:25:38.670]  But I wanted to get him on to see if he agrees with me or see what he's focused on.
[01:25:39.409 --> 01:25:41.750]  But I just see election fraud being caught everywhere.
[01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:44.270]  Judges ruling against them everywhere.
[01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:46.949]  The illegals voting being caught.
[01:25:47.149 --> 01:25:50.350]  I mean, this is the mask coming off.
[01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:51.569]  You cannot deny that.
[01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:54.289]  That's for sure that culturally, spiritually...
[01:25:56.210 --> 01:26:01.590]  That the Great Awakening just went from a huge explosion to supernova.
[01:26:01.989 --> 01:26:03.989]  Viva Frye, what do you say to those statements?
[01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:04.729]  Do you agree with that?
[01:26:05.989 --> 01:26:09.569]  Alex, now that you actually said it out loud, I hadn't thought about it.
[01:26:09.859 --> 01:26:16.819]  Coming after him to impeach him again, because now they can at least hang their hat on the fact that he's been convicted of a crime.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.479]  Before, when they tried to impeach him, there wasn't even a crime.
[01:26:19.579 --> 01:26:22.520]  They were arguing, you don't actually need to have committed a crime.
[01:26:22.659 --> 01:26:23.500]  It could be anything.
[01:26:23.619 --> 01:26:25.300]  You can impeach him for the color of his tie.
[01:26:25.899 --> 01:26:31.500]  But now that they got that bogus conviction out of New York, maybe they make an argument to try to impeach him again.
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:36.699]  You're right, by the way, that this is a unification unlike any other.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:45.539]  And I want to make the joke that Kamala Harris is actually the most unifying presidential candidate ever because she unified everybody behind Donald Trump.
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.239]  Trump and Vance and the populist movement is one thing.
[01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:53.760]  To unify Tulsi Gabbards of the world, of the Democrat Party, RFK Jr.
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:27:00.819]  of the Democrat Party, she truly is the great unifier in this, in that she's a force of evil driving forces of good to coalesce.
[01:27:01.399 --> 01:27:14.000]  But I feel it, and I do think that maybe, to the extent that tonight's victory is going to be decisive enough, I naively, optimistically say they're just going to have to give up at some point.
[01:27:14.239 --> 01:27:16.500]  An impeachment after this will not work.
[01:27:18.039 --> 01:27:27.619]  God forbid another attempt It won't work because the movement is already there, JD Vance is already there, and it won't serve their purposes.
[01:27:27.819 --> 01:27:35.520]  So at some point, they might just have to roll over and say, all right, time to move on or at least jump ship.
[01:27:35.819 --> 01:27:37.319]  I made the joke, Alex.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:39.380]  Biden can resign.
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:44.159]  He can pardon all federal agents who are fearful of being prosecuted under a Trump presidency.
[01:27:44.439 --> 01:27:47.340]  Pardon all the rats, let them resign, and then they'll just jump ship.
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:53.300]  But I think if it's decisive enough tonight, maybe the chicanery will come to a screeching halt, hopefully.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:56.939]  You're absolutely right.
[01:27:57.239 --> 01:27:58.140]  What do you make?
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:27:59.340]  I know I watch your show.
[01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:05.979]  I mean, all the fraud coming out, judges ordering the millions of, you know, names that we know are illegals and others to be released.
[01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:10.779]  Judges saying, no, you can't keep counting ballots, you know, that aren't postmarked after the election.
[01:28:11.439 --> 01:28:13.920]  I mean, there's a lot more wins than there are losses.
[01:28:14.119 --> 01:28:24.619]  We have Nevada saying they can keep going for days with unpostmarked ballots, but in the aggregate, and Roger Stone's the expert, and he agrees with me, there was almost no defense for fraud four years ago.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.199]  Now, we are like...
[01:28:26.439 --> 01:28:28.640]  It flies on you-know-what on their ass.
[01:28:28.779 --> 01:28:30.500]  I mean, we are on their ass.
[01:28:30.779 --> 01:28:32.439]  They're kicking out poll watchers.
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:33.100]  Lawyers come.
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:34.539]  They're being forced back in.
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:36.640]  They're catching them flipping votes everywhere.
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:41.039]  They're catching them pulling Republican votes off, putting Democrats on in Houston, putting it back on.
[01:28:41.199 --> 01:28:43.539]  I mean, we are on their ass.
[01:28:43.659 --> 01:28:50.600]  And it's not just the Republicans with Trump finally in control of much of the RNC with his daughter-in-law doing a great job from zero resistance.
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:52.979]  So I'd say 60% resistance is what they should be doing.
[01:28:53.119 --> 01:28:55.680]  But there are all these grassroots legal groups and people just...
[01:28:55.989 --> 01:28:58.409]  Kicking ass, just killing it.
[01:28:58.990 --> 01:28:59.510]  It is.
[01:28:59.630 --> 01:29:05.449]  What's amazing, and I had thought about this as well, yeah, it seems that the courts have stepped up, and I'll put it in quotes because I don't think they stepped up.
[01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:12.149]  I think they've been forced to step up to actually do the right thing this time around because you look at the tools and you look at the players.
[01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:15.250]  In 2020, you had a controlled Twitter.
[01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:16.770]  You did not have a free Twitter.
[01:29:16.949 --> 01:29:19.369]  You had intelligence censorship.
[01:29:19.529 --> 01:29:24.869]  You had government interfering with private enterprise or social media platforms for government censorship.
[01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:26.250]  You don't have that now.
[01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:27.649]  They don't have those tools.
[01:29:27.989 --> 01:29:35.329]  So Twitter, or commonly referred to as X, it's no longer under the control of a deep state, a government apparatus.
[01:29:35.649 --> 01:29:51.449]  You got Rumble out there, and in as much as Rumble doesn't have the user base as a YouTube, they've got the biggest tools to fight the public warfare, which is the top podcasts that are reaching hundreds of thousands of millions of people daily.
[01:29:51.729 --> 01:29:55.319]  You got Bongino, Bannon gets out of jail, Crushes it on Rumble.
[01:29:55.479 --> 01:30:01.539]  So you've got the tools that are no longer the same as the hands tied behind the back back in 2020.
[01:30:01.859 --> 01:30:07.239]  And it puts the courts on absolute blast that they can't run and hide like they did in 2020.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:10.239]  And so they have to step up and deal with the actual overt fraud.
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:13.699]  It was last week, Posobiec puts it on blast.
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.439]  You know, what's going on in Pennsylvania?
[01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:23.109]  And shutting down early voting three hours early, you know, because it's a long and Tedious effort to vote early.
[01:30:23.189 --> 01:30:27.470]  Viva, you are nailing it because we have some free press and spotlights.
[01:30:27.670 --> 01:30:31.090]  If you don't have lights on your car driving around the middle of the desert, you're gonna run to a sand dune.
[01:30:31.170 --> 01:30:37.210]  We've got lights now, and so they can't get away with it because it's red-handed, red-handed, red-handed, red-handed.
[01:30:37.329 --> 01:30:41.229]  And people had the machines flipping four years ago, but you couldn't put it on X or anywhere else.
[01:30:41.539 --> 01:30:43.579]  People had all this, but it would get shut down.
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:50.640]  And the FBI, when the postal carrier would say, I was sitting there for eight hours waiting for him, and all these trucks were pulling up, pulling out the same packages.
[01:30:50.659 --> 01:30:54.800]  So I looked, there were tens of thousands of ballots just for Joe Biden, and it's all confirmed.
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:58.260]  The FBI comes and threatens him, and they take the press conferences down.
[01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:01.500]  Now they're not getting away with that because they don't have air superiority.
[01:31:02.489 --> 01:31:05.270]  They don't have the monopoly over the airwaves anymore.
[01:31:05.449 --> 01:31:11.130]  And it's an amazing thing when Musk was on Rogan and he's talking about having changed the course of the universe.
[01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:17.710]  When you have X reaching 100,000 Americans, that's more than all of MSM combined.
[01:31:17.890 --> 01:31:19.229]  Now, admittedly, you're reaching less.
[01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:21.829]  I said I meant 100 million.
[01:31:21.949 --> 01:31:22.189]  I'm sorry.
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:26.159]  If I said 100,000- By the way, it's way more than 100 million, brother.
[01:31:26.439 --> 01:31:28.560]  We're clocking some days on there.
[01:31:29.479 --> 01:31:31.819]  40 million people clicking on it and watching it?
[01:31:31.939 --> 01:31:32.460]  I mean- Well, no, no.
[01:31:32.579 --> 01:31:34.159]  What I mean, Alex, what I mean is Americans.
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:38.420]  They reach a third of America, at least, but say even more.
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:38.880]  You're right.
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:40.220]  They can't get away with it.
[01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:42.640]  And admittedly, they're reaching the left and the right.
[01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:50.560]  But they have full exposure, and so the courts can't run and hide- X is a major beachhead, a major beachhead.
[01:31:50.979 --> 01:31:56.500]  And you got Rumble, and you got Bongino, who's getting 200,000, putting it on blast every day.
[01:31:56.500 --> 01:32:03.159]  So they don't have the cloak of darkness that they had in terms of suppression of I think?
[01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:23.550]  Some malfunctions.
[01:32:23.710 --> 01:32:27.470]  They only have four years to prepare for this in Josh Shapiro's corrupt Pennsylvania state.
[01:32:27.829 --> 01:32:33.949]  From a government perspective, they're having malfunctioning software in what I looked up were predominantly Republican areas.
[01:32:34.130 --> 01:32:45.890]  I mean, if it were not for the immediate, real-time, full spotlight of social media and the hundreds of millions of people that are being reached immediately through these platforms, they would probably get away with it yet again.
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:53.659]  It's a different ballgame now, and it's going to be reflected in the results I'm predicting and hoping and crossing my fingers and touching wood.
[01:32:55.319 --> 01:32:56.220]  There's your headline.
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:05.659]  The X spotlight of truth, the mighty spotlight of X truth frustrates Democrats' plans to steal election in live time.
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:06.380]  I mean, it is.
[01:33:06.779 --> 01:33:08.920]  Folks, I know you know, listeners, but this is all I do.
[01:33:09.039 --> 01:33:13.750]  I worked, no exaggeration, 19 hours yesterday.
[01:33:13.949 --> 01:33:15.909]  I slept four hours, four and a half hours.
[01:33:16.210 --> 01:33:22.210]  Ladies and gentlemen, I just showed you a bunch of evidence that it is unraveling in live time.
[01:33:22.350 --> 01:33:23.930]  We are routing them.
[01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:25.710]  This is beautiful.
[01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:28.729]  I don't want to be too optimistic because what about the false flag?
[01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:31.770]  I mean, the FBI... Press release says they ran the guy.
[01:33:31.890 --> 01:33:32.670]  They built the bomb.
[01:33:32.850 --> 01:33:34.489]  They were his white supremacy leaders.
[01:33:34.649 --> 01:33:37.649]  They conducted Nordic rituals with him.
[01:33:37.890 --> 01:33:39.890]  They wanted him to go shoot up a place.
[01:33:40.109 --> 01:33:43.170]  But instead, he said, no, I'm going to bomb a power station.
[01:33:43.369 --> 01:33:45.329]  I mean, right on time, that happening.
[01:33:45.609 --> 01:33:47.069]  What the hell's going on there?
[01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:59.939]  Look, you can never put anything past anybody, but you appreciate that with Rumble X and the live streams that are gonna be covering this tonight and throughout the day, they will not be able to get away with it.
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:03.439]  The things that they did objectively get away with in 2020.
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:05.520]  So it is just a question.
[01:34:06.579 --> 01:34:08.920]  Of too big to rig, beat the cheat.
[01:34:09.039 --> 01:34:09.619]  What's the other one there?
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:10.279]  There's another one.
[01:34:10.399 --> 01:34:11.079]  No, I forget it.
[01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:13.239]  That the results have to be so overwhelming.
[01:34:13.479 --> 01:34:20.680]  But all eyes should be on Pennsylvania because they're gonna try something suspicious, questionable with that state, and it's starting already.
[01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:27.880]  Oh, even mainstream media admits it's all the key Republican counties and areas that the machines just aren't working.
[01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:32.359]  After a judge just ruled they did do voter suppression and kept closing polls at 1 p.m.
[01:34:32.699 --> 01:34:34.119]  I mean, they are just...
[01:34:34.119 --> 01:34:47.060]  It's brazen, but in fairness, had it been predominantly Democrat areas, then I would be suspicious that they're saying, oh, we've got to extend it, we've got to gather up as much as we need and then wait for the Republican areas to tell us how many votes they have so that we know how many we need.
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:54.539]  We're good to go.
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:18.939]  And they're not gonna be able to wash their hands and run away from it, the courts like they did the last time.
[01:35:20.359 --> 01:35:22.859]  Absolutely, I've been asking the questions here, but you're a smart cookie.
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:23.939]  What else is on your radar?
[01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:26.159]  No, I'm following that.
[01:35:26.279 --> 01:35:30.119]  I mean, the question is just gonna be, what's gonna happen tonight?
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:33.119]  I mean, Pennsylvania is the biggie.
[01:35:34.319 --> 01:35:35.880]  Michigan is a big one as well.
[01:35:36.510 --> 01:35:40.869]  But I mean, we're just gonna be following what happens throughout the day and keeping up with the stories and keeping them on blast.
[01:35:41.029 --> 01:35:43.710]  So the big stories are coming out of Pennsylvania right now.
[01:35:43.829 --> 01:35:45.329]  Florida, I'm sitting here in Florida.
[01:35:45.449 --> 01:35:47.909]  I was trying to find a way to volunteer to drive.
[01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:50.869]  There was a Disabled American Veterans Association.
[01:35:50.869 --> 01:35:52.949]  I was trying to drive people to and from the polls.
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:56.060]  Apparently a lot of people vote early and it's not even easy to volunteer.
[01:35:56.319 --> 01:35:59.659]  So I'm just sitting here, I'm going to be following the biggest developments.
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:09.500]  But right now, extending the voting hours in, it's Cambria and another district in Pennsylvania, which are predominantly Republican until I think it's now 10 o'clock.
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:11.680]  I'd want to double check to make sure I'm not getting that wrong.
[01:36:11.859 --> 01:36:17.079]  But following what's going on because it's going to be all eyes on Pennsylvania and not letting...
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:18.420]  Philadelphia.
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:22.579]  I'm borrowing some knowledge from a guy named Mark Grobert.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:24.220]  If you've never heard of him, Alex, you should have him on.
[01:36:24.399 --> 01:36:35.380]  But his theory is that Philly, like they've done in the past, biggest epicenter of Pennsylvania waits to see what the other areas are reporting so they know what they need in order to try to make up that.
[01:36:35.479 --> 01:36:36.119]  No, it's not a theory.
[01:36:36.159 --> 01:36:37.100]  They do that with Detroit.
[01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:38.460]  They do it with Atlanta.
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:41.819]  They do it in Maricopa County, Phoenix.
[01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:42.960]  No, that's what they do.
[01:36:43.659 --> 01:36:43.979]  Exactly.
[01:36:44.239 --> 01:36:44.920]  That's what they do.
[01:36:45.329 --> 01:37:02.010]  So, I mean, the bottom line, the thing to watch tonight is to make sure that it doesn't, the count doesn't go on for too long, because the longer it goes on, the more of this chicanery occurs, and the more, not advanced notice, but the more results that come in, the more the big epicenters that can control how many ballots they can find,
[01:37:02.210 --> 01:37:05.630]  they know what number they need to break, or they need to reach in order to, you know.
[01:37:06.130 --> 01:37:06.850]  Seal the deal.
[01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:10.250]  So it's gonna be a question of making sure this doesn't drag on the count.
[01:37:10.329 --> 01:37:11.869]  The count should be done pretty quickly.
[01:37:12.130 --> 01:37:18.890]  And the amazing thing is where some of these states, and I forget which ones now, I think it was Arizona, saying how you might not know for weeks.
[01:37:19.369 --> 01:37:21.779]  That is not even third world- Yeah.
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:26.380]  It's not even banana republic like kangaroo systems in third world countries.
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:27.760]  It's pure corruption.
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:33.579]  And it's such corruption that if any other country were to say that, America would be the first to say, this is a problem.
[01:37:34.119 --> 01:37:39.039]  And yet they wanna, what is it, astroturf you, pre-Swayia thinking that this is normal.
[01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:39.960]  It's not normal.
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:44.500]  And it's not normal in the swing states that are the most critical and the most corrupt of the swing states.
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:46.239]  And I'm referring to governments and not people here.
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:50.520]  And by the way, that's what the Democrat officials say in all the states, Michigan, Arizona.
[01:37:50.699 --> 01:37:51.840]  They go, this is normal.
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:57.380]  No, until Trump won in 2016, we always learn on election night or early the next day.
[01:37:57.539 --> 01:37:59.500]  Now they go, the new normal is weeks and weeks.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:01.340]  It's preposterous.
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:02.300]  And now we learn this.
[01:38:02.789 --> 01:38:03.029]  Go ahead.
[01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:06.390]  It's preposterous because the technology gets better, and yet the results get worse.
[01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:11.449]  So it's not only not possible, it's outlandish on its face.
[01:38:11.649 --> 01:38:18.350]  That technology gets better, and they're implementing electronic voting machines, and it's complicating and delaying the process.
[01:38:18.569 --> 01:38:19.930]  Well, then it's not an accident.
[01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:20.750]  Then it's deliberate.
[01:38:20.909 --> 01:38:23.449]  And I genuinely now have gotten a little bit blackpilled cynical.
[01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:24.550]  It is deliberate.
[01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:25.170]  It's obvious.
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:31.539]  And the only thing is that in order to win, this is like my father always said when we were growing up, you gotta work harder to succeed.
[01:38:31.859 --> 01:38:39.539]  In order for the Republicans just to win, they have to outperform in order to make this a fair election because of the degree of cheating that goes on in these corrupt counties.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:44.689]  And not only Democrats, Georgia 2020 Was a big, big problem.
[01:38:45.130 --> 01:38:48.569]  Not ever doing the signature matches is exactly how you get away with it.
[01:38:48.689 --> 01:38:53.970]  And it's not because they have a R in front of their name that they're any less corrupt than some of the big D Democrats.
[01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:56.310]  And so Raffensperger.
[01:38:56.829 --> 01:38:57.689]  Yeah, we've got Rhino.
[01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:25.689]  I've got NBC News, ABC News...
[01:39:26.069 --> 01:39:27.090]  I mean, it's all coming out.
[01:39:27.210 --> 01:39:28.609]  They're getting caught with their hand in the cookie jar.
[01:39:28.789 --> 01:39:36.569]  I want to say they're caught red-handed, but in this case, they're caught dead-handed because they actually have dead, they're actually requesting ballots for dead voters.
[01:39:36.789 --> 01:39:41.210]  I mean, it's everything that they said has not been happening, and we're seeing it in real time.
[01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:43.189]  And they're going to move the goalposts like they did in 2020.
[01:39:43.369 --> 01:39:45.130]  They'll say, oh, it's not, there's no fraud.
[01:39:45.329 --> 01:39:47.310]  Okay, there's no widespread voter fraud.
[01:39:47.409 --> 01:39:50.989]  Okay, there's no widespread voter fraud that would have changed the outcome of the election.
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:52.340]  We're seeing it now.
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:40:08.689]  Everything we knew of 2020, I'm not yet on the immediate vote flipping or the fractional counting or the servers in foreign countries, but everything that people were complaining about Prior to 2020, the problems with electronic voting, we're seeing real, the problems with ballot harvesting,
[01:40:09.010 --> 01:40:15.770]  the problem with not purging voter rolls so that you have so-called dead voters on voter rolls or people who are dead or might be out of state.
[01:40:16.029 --> 01:40:17.710]  And you now have concrete evidence.
[01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:18.390]  What's the company called?
[01:40:18.449 --> 01:40:19.649]  It was called Media Plus or something.
[01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:20.569]  I heard it had a plus in it.
[01:40:21.310 --> 01:40:26.670]  They're going and requesting ballots for dead people, literally, and people who are not eligible voters.
[01:40:26.670 --> 01:40:27.550]  But wait, let's go further.
[01:40:27.789 --> 01:40:40.939]  For the first time in modern history since we've had absentee ballot, We're good to go.
[01:40:40.939 --> 01:40:51.600]  We're good to go.
[01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:58.409]  It doesn't matter if you're a citizen.
[01:40:58.409 --> 01:41:00.289]  If you live here, you can vote nationally.
[01:41:00.710 --> 01:41:01.310]  Come on in.
[01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:04.829]  Now they wanna indict O'Keeffe saying he violated people's rights.
[01:41:04.829 --> 01:41:05.850]  He didn't even go in the building.
[01:41:05.970 --> 01:41:07.069]  He asked him at the door.
[01:41:07.369 --> 01:41:08.649]  This is insane.
[01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:10.350]  It's insane.
[01:41:10.649 --> 01:41:13.510]  They're not gonna be able to get away with it like they did before.
[01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:23.470]  They will still try to persecute the truth tellers much in the same way They go after the whistleblowers, but not the actual lawbreakers.
[01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:30.310]  And I mean, I think it was Ed Snowden who said it, but when you punish the people who expose the crimes, you're living in full-fledged tyranny.
[01:41:31.170 --> 01:41:34.250]  It's amazing what we're seeing actually happen in real time.
[01:41:34.609 --> 01:41:39.550]  The not purging, people who self-identified as non-citizens.
[01:41:39.710 --> 01:41:41.609]  This was in Virginia, if I'm not mistaken.
[01:41:42.410 --> 01:41:48.930]  By not purging, people have identified as non-citizens because it's within 90 days of the election.
[01:41:49.289 --> 01:41:50.970]  I mean, the number is inconsequential.
[01:41:51.210 --> 01:41:55.029]  The Chinese student that voted illegally, they say his vote still counts.
[01:41:56.189 --> 01:42:08.489]  I mean, it's satire, it's parody, and it just, I think it's been laid so bare that Even the middle of the ground rational who are not totally brainwashed TDS Democrats are saying, yeah, we're on board now.
[01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:13.170]  And so you have to outperform the cheat in order just to get the fair result.
[01:42:13.630 --> 01:42:17.409]  We're on our, I hope to goodness, we're on our way to it.
[01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:23.850]  The problem is going to be ultimately, if there is something totally unforeseen, totally unbelievable, no one's going to believe it.
[01:42:23.949 --> 01:42:44.659]  And then the question is, what happens, not just to America, but to the world, when everyone says, we just don't believe I think that they were astroturfing a little bit of a potential Kamala win by playing with the betting markets as they did over the weekend because it made no sense Why Kamala Harris went from 40-cent underdog to a 55-cent favorite and then back down,
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:48.920]  except to say, well, look, she won, but the markets predicted it on Saturday and Sunday.
[01:42:49.079 --> 01:42:50.180]  So I'm concerned about that.
[01:42:50.239 --> 01:42:57.159]  But the problem is if people have no faith in the system, seeing the actual fraud now in real time, and it's objective, it's confirmed.
[01:42:57.239 --> 01:42:58.819]  You can't get in trouble on YouTube for saying it.
[01:42:58.979 --> 01:43:01.359]  They broke election laws in Pennsylvania last week.
[01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:03.300]  And a judge had to come in and fix it.
[01:43:03.479 --> 01:43:04.319]  We're seeing it now.
[01:43:04.439 --> 01:43:15.199]  And if the result is something wildly unbelievable, that the most awful, insidious, disgusting, moronic idiot of a candidate wins, along with her running mate who's equally repulsive, no one's gonna believe it.
[01:43:15.279 --> 01:43:17.699]  And I don't know what happens then, but hopefully we avoid that.
[01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:18.420]  All right.
[01:43:18.619 --> 01:43:19.260]  Viva Frye.
[01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:26.760]  VivaBarnesLaw.locals.com at the Viva Frye on X. Please join us again tonight and tomorrow.
[01:43:26.819 --> 01:43:27.899]  Let the producers know the time.
[01:43:28.039 --> 01:43:28.619]  Viva, we love you.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:29.460]  Amazing analysis.
[01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:30.560]  Thank you very much.
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.979]  I'll be live and bouncing around, but yeah, I'll come in, Alex.
[01:43:33.079 --> 01:43:34.600]  It's going to be one heck of a night.
[01:43:34.909 --> 01:43:35.649]  Thank you so much.
[01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:36.350]  Great to be here with you.
[01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:38.430]  Great to be sharing with us with all the listeners and viewers.
[01:43:39.210 --> 01:43:41.289]  I'm telling you folks, so much work to get to this place.
[01:43:41.409 --> 01:43:43.489]  As Trump said Sunday, nine years of hard battle.
[01:43:43.890 --> 01:43:44.649]  It's been intense.
[01:43:44.729 --> 01:43:45.510]  We've drawn the enemy out.
[01:43:46.090 --> 01:43:48.090]  We've got the great Gavin McGinnis coming up.
[01:43:48.810 --> 01:43:51.689]  In the fourth hour, I'm going to take calls and do an X Spaces.
[01:43:52.050 --> 01:43:53.369]  I'm going to continue on.
[01:43:53.489 --> 01:43:59.029]  Owen Schroyer is really good at all the maps and all of the latest developments.
[01:43:59.029 --> 01:44:02.170]  He'll be with us all night bringing all of that in.
[01:44:02.250 --> 01:44:08.510]  And remember, if you're watching us on X or Infowars.com forward slash show, share those live feeds on your email, your text messages, word of mouth.
[01:44:08.670 --> 01:44:12.930]  Share the links to our live feeds at Relox Jones and at the Infowars links and at...
[01:44:13.950 --> 01:44:14.609]  AJN Live.
[01:44:14.789 --> 01:44:15.770]  That's the AJN Network.
[01:44:15.869 --> 01:44:21.529]  In case they shut us down next week, follow us there at AJN Live on X. There's all the feeds right there.
[01:44:21.850 --> 01:44:24.590]  Share them, share them, share them, and say, here is the censored truth.
[01:44:24.810 --> 01:44:27.750]  Here is the best feed, I believe, of what's happening.
[01:44:27.829 --> 01:44:29.909]  And we're going to be checking in with Stephen Crowder and their feeds.
[01:44:30.210 --> 01:44:32.930]  Everybody else, Roger Stone, the list goes on and on tonight.
[01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.710]  Now...
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:40.279]  We could be shut down next week, but we got sponsors and backup studios and satellite uplinks, we need money for the crew, and legal to battle the enemy.
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:45.739]  I need funds, so I make it easy for you to support us with our great sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:47.239]  Don't just vote for Trump today.
[01:44:47.479 --> 01:44:52.300]  Vote to keep a hardcore broadcast the enemy says themselves is the most effective against them.
[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:54.279]  And get great products.
[01:45:23.159 --> 01:45:24.619]  It isn't just high-quality electrolytes.
[01:45:24.659 --> 01:45:25.300]  It's the vitamins.
[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:27.220]  It's the minerals.
[01:45:27.439 --> 01:45:29.100]  It is super powerful.
[01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:30.340]  People love it.
[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:32.520]  You can get it for 55% off for three canisters.
[01:45:33.369 --> 01:45:35.710]  50% off for two and 40 for one.
[01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:37.069]  There's so many other great products.
[01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:38.409]  And then I came up with this idea.
[01:45:38.949 --> 01:45:40.109]  I love this hat.
[01:45:40.210 --> 01:45:41.270]  They got it made so quick.
[01:45:41.489 --> 01:45:42.890]  That's why they're our great sponsor.
[01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:44.409]  Trashy American.
[01:45:44.430 --> 01:45:46.710]  Because you're all trash because you love freedom and aren't a communist.
[01:45:47.069 --> 01:45:52.369]  This hat is available as well at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:45:52.569 --> 01:45:55.430]  Get this along with hundreds and hundreds of designs.
[01:45:55.609 --> 01:45:56.590]  More getting added.
[01:45:57.130 --> 01:45:58.130]  Justice for Peanut.
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:02.420]  You know, the squirrel, all of that is there at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:46:02.539 --> 01:46:09.020]  And you fund the second American revolution and the globalists that hate our guts and want us off the air, get even more pissed.
[01:46:09.159 --> 01:46:10.199]  I'm in your hands.
[01:46:10.319 --> 01:46:11.640]  I will keep fighting no matter what.
[01:46:11.779 --> 01:46:13.279]  But I can't do it without you.
[01:46:13.439 --> 01:46:15.720]  Show thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:46:15.859 --> 01:46:19.899]  But whatever you do, take the live links at Relox Jones and share them like your life depends on it.
[01:46:20.199 --> 01:46:21.340]  They're coming after everybody.
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:22.300]  They're coming after Trump.
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:23.159]  They're coming after Kennedy.
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:24.260]  We need your support.
[01:46:24.319 --> 01:46:25.279]  And you don't even come here and do this.
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:26.739]  Alex, first of all, I want to thank you.
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:27.800]  Give to Alex Jones.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:33.159]  I don't want this guy to have to be like wearing a symbol and we're all going to say, you know, the truth teller formerly known as Alex Jones.
[01:46:33.279 --> 01:46:34.439]  Let's not let that happen.
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:36.199]  Well, they're trying to make an example out of me.
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:39.180]  I'm not that important, but I've become a rallying point.
[01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:41.539]  I've become like a Roman standard they want to capture.
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:42.199]  Explain that.
[01:46:42.689 --> 01:46:51.630]  Look, I mean, if we don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the First Amendment, if, you know, media, which is, look, it never said only newspapers or the media.
[01:46:51.789 --> 01:47:00.649]  It was anyone that wants to challenge government, anyone that's willing to put the feet to the fire of corporate interests of your government, that is supposed to be free.
[01:47:00.810 --> 01:47:01.810]  Electronic soapbox.
[01:47:02.069 --> 01:47:06.050]  In the end, if you lose, Alex, we all lose.
[01:47:06.170 --> 01:47:12.029]  We will all lose the ability to do tough stories, to take risks, to plant flags where we think there's an issue.
[01:47:12.250 --> 01:47:13.289]  Sometime we'll get it wrong.
[01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:15.350]  I said before, you do a daily show.
[01:47:15.529 --> 01:47:17.250]  It's impossible to nail that to the wall.
[01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:18.289]  I do a weekly show.
[01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:19.829]  I spend more time vetting it.
[01:47:19.949 --> 01:47:20.810]  They're two different animals.
[01:47:20.970 --> 01:47:21.970]  They can't be compared to each other.
[01:47:21.970 --> 01:47:23.350]  They also take stuff out of context.
[01:47:23.489 --> 01:47:23.989]  I'm exaggerating.
[01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:25.329]  Absolutely, that's true.
[01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:33.989]  You know, one of the things that makes you so spectacular, Alex, is long before any of us were here, You were starting to talk about this deep state.
[01:47:34.170 --> 01:47:45.550]  You were talking about this, you know, a government that was supposed to be of, for and by the people that was being robbed from us by corporate interests, by special interests, by globalists, long before anybody else ever did.
[01:47:46.109 --> 01:47:51.090]  And to imagine you sitting here in this moment, we are in that impactful moment.
[01:47:51.210 --> 01:47:53.350]  And in many ways, not enough people are listening to you.
[01:47:53.550 --> 01:48:08.869]  And I want to say that, you know, I think the vaccine, and we've talked about this before, that was the tip of the spear of the final death blow, which was if we can inject you and own your bodies and own the bodies of your children and pass laws that say that, you know, because of vaccinations,
[01:48:08.869 --> 01:48:10.930]  we've decided that we own your children.
[01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.930]  We make a decision.
[01:48:12.109 --> 01:48:13.390]  That's a revolutionary takeover.
[01:48:13.409 --> 01:48:17.550]  It was a revolutionary takeover, and so people like me got alarmed by that.
[01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:22.149]  And we joined forces with people like you that have been really talking about it for a long time.
[01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:25.229]  But I would say that we're at the very last stage.
[01:48:25.289 --> 01:48:29.310]  I was just speaking publicly, and this woman said, things don't happen that fast, Del.
[01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:30.289]  You're being really dramatic.
[01:48:30.289 --> 01:48:32.670]  I don't think this election matters that much.
[01:48:32.829 --> 01:48:37.210]  I was like, that's because you're looking at this over the last year, maybe two years.
[01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:59.680]  There's people like Bobby that's been fighting the corporate establishment for four We're really at the end stage of a takeover and destruction of the one thing that stands in the way of globalist thinking,
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:02.659]  which is the Constitution of the United States of America.
[01:49:02.909 --> 01:49:04.909]  They're doing all these lawsuits trying to take my name.
[01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:05.729]  People say they can't do that.
[01:49:05.850 --> 01:49:06.710]  Well, I got to defend those.
[01:49:06.869 --> 01:49:07.510]  We're going to win.
[01:49:07.649 --> 01:49:08.109]  We're already winning.
[01:49:08.210 --> 01:49:09.310]  The judge shut them down last week.
[01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:13.270]  That took high-powered lawyers and that, you know, 50 grand right there to have those briefs ready, okay?
[01:49:13.369 --> 01:49:14.569]  This is total war.
[01:49:14.770 --> 01:49:15.590]  We make it easy.
[01:49:15.689 --> 01:49:17.789]  Great supplements, great t-shirts, great everything.
[01:49:18.090 --> 01:49:19.729]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:49:19.810 --> 01:49:20.649]  Come a VIP member.
[01:49:20.729 --> 01:49:21.729]  You get 40 bucks free a month.
[01:49:21.850 --> 01:49:23.350]  For 30 bucks, you make 10 bucks on that.
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:24.020]  We're good to go.
[01:49:24.659 --> 01:49:45.579]  We're good to go.
[01:49:46.289 --> 01:49:47.489]  I just hope the money comes in.
[01:49:47.569 --> 01:49:48.489]  But we're going on the offense.
[01:49:48.670 --> 01:49:49.329]  We caught them.
[01:49:49.409 --> 01:49:50.109]  We got the documents.
[01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:52.430]  I told you I'll sue the CIA and FBI. Get ready.
[01:49:52.689 --> 01:49:53.930]  First steps start this week.
[01:49:54.029 --> 01:49:54.750]  And the enemy already knows.
[01:49:54.930 --> 01:49:55.909]  So, I'm just...
[01:49:55.909 --> 01:49:57.550]  But I need money to do it.
[01:49:57.590 --> 01:49:59.590]  And look, I don't even think about my life or any of that.
[01:49:59.649 --> 01:50:00.170]  That doesn't matter.
[01:50:00.250 --> 01:50:00.909]  I'm on this mission.
[01:50:00.970 --> 01:50:01.449]  I love it.
[01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.989]  This is great.
[01:50:02.329 --> 01:50:04.510]  But I need funds to fight a war.
[01:50:05.229 --> 01:50:05.989]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:50:06.770 --> 01:50:07.609]  DrJonesNational.com.
[01:50:07.890 --> 01:50:09.770]  Those are the coordinates of the resistance.
[01:50:10.210 --> 01:50:10.989]  It's all there.
[01:50:11.130 --> 01:50:12.010]  And it's great products.
[01:50:12.090 --> 01:50:12.829]  At great prices.
[01:50:12.970 --> 01:50:13.609]  Highest quality.
[01:50:13.829 --> 01:50:14.590]  And it funds...
[01:50:14.979 --> 01:50:19.899]  The fight against the New World Order that's coming down on us with both damn feet, but at least we're in the fight and we're starting to win.
[01:50:20.319 --> 01:50:20.979]  All right.
[01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:23.060]  One of my favorite people, Gavin McInnes.
[01:50:24.010 --> 01:50:26.090]  Is our guest for the next 30 minutes?
[01:50:26.250 --> 01:50:30.750]  Then, I'm opening the phones up for what you're seeing around the country, your predictions, and more.
[01:50:31.029 --> 01:50:33.850]  Live coverage here at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:50:34.109 --> 01:50:40.170]  Band out video with our own streams in case X goes down and at Real Alex Jones on X. Gamma Guinness is at Censored.tv.
[01:50:40.869 --> 01:50:45.729]  And, boy, he is one of the original OGs in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:50:46.149 --> 01:50:49.989]  His predictions, his take on what's happening, I see a total political realignment.
[01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.949]  The dam has broken.
[01:50:51.819 --> 01:50:55.039]  Even if they killed Trevor Still the election, it's the end of the globalist.
[01:50:55.319 --> 01:50:59.439]  Elon Musk declaring war on the New World Order and saying global government wants to destroy you.
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:00.380]  Your life's in danger.
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:01.020]  It's all true.
[01:51:01.579 --> 01:51:05.720]  I mean, man, it's like the whole world's become Alex Jones and Gavin McGinnis.
[01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:07.420]  Gavin, my friend...
[01:51:08.250 --> 01:51:10.829]  I tell you, I've been waiting for this a long time.
[01:51:10.970 --> 01:51:14.829]  I'm not saying we won the war, but we're winning kind of the Battle of Stalingrad here.
[01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:18.430]  And so it'll be over for the bad guys.
[01:51:18.649 --> 01:51:20.090]  I mean, this is the big battle.
[01:51:20.210 --> 01:51:21.449]  This is the deciding factor.
[01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:22.029]  What do you think?
[01:51:22.050 --> 01:51:22.569]  Am I wrong?
[01:51:22.789 --> 01:51:25.550]  Because I respect your gravitas, my friend.
[01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:26.130]  What do you think?
[01:51:32.489 --> 01:51:34.270]  That was a really good pregnant pause.
[01:51:34.890 --> 01:51:37.029]  I can't hear Alex very well at all.
[01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:38.520]  I love it.
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:40.439]  Dun, dun, dun.
[01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:43.699]  Well, even if you can't hear me, Gavin, what do you make of what's happening?
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:46.619]  There you go.
[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:51.859]  But, you know, I can just kind of sit here and look at him.
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:52:01.199]  He looks like a happy, happy, one of those creatures that pop up out in the middle of fields.
[01:52:03.789 --> 01:52:04.550]  A meerkat.
[01:52:04.890 --> 01:52:06.529]  He's a happy meerkat.
[01:52:06.710 --> 01:52:08.130]  Make America great again.
[01:52:09.439 --> 01:52:12.279]  Well, this is the fun part of live radio.
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:15.100]  We're going to go back to him in a minute.
[01:52:15.319 --> 01:52:20.840]  I wanted to play this clip again because it's Elon Musk breaking down what's really happening.
[01:52:20.979 --> 01:52:21.420]  It's clip 11.
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:22.640]  And he's right.
[01:52:22.779 --> 01:52:24.199]  This is an existential threat.
[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:24.979]  This is it.
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:28.579]  And the globalists will absolutely enslave you if they have their way.
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:29.119]  Here it is.
[01:52:29.279 --> 01:52:30.300]  I'll say it again, man.
[01:52:31.039 --> 01:52:32.539]  I think this was the last election.
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:33.600]  If Trump doesn't win...
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:35.500]  This is the last election.
[01:52:35.699 --> 01:52:36.220]  I think you're right.
[01:52:36.619 --> 01:52:36.960]  Yeah.
[01:52:37.399 --> 01:52:38.119]  I think you're right.
[01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:43.520]  I think people, and a lot of people, are waking up and realize that, that have been lifelong Democrats.
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:45.760]  Guys like Bill Ackman, guys like Chamath.
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:45.960]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:48.199]  Tulsi Gabbard switched over to the Republicans.
[01:52:48.439 --> 01:52:53.460]  There's a lot of people who their whole life, they've been left-wing, and they realize, like, I can't do this anymore.
[01:52:53.479 --> 01:52:54.439]  You and I used to be Democrats.
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:54.779]  Yeah.
[01:52:54.979 --> 01:52:55.260]  So.
[01:52:55.420 --> 01:52:55.699]  Yeah.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:56.180]  Yeah.
[01:52:56.439 --> 01:52:57.300]  It's nuts.
[01:52:58.010 --> 01:52:58.729]  It's nuts, man.
[01:52:58.850 --> 01:53:05.350]  If the Dems win this election, they will legalize enough illegals to turn the swing states, and everywhere will be like California.
[01:53:05.550 --> 01:53:06.789]  There will be no escape.
[01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:08.529]  That is so insane.
[01:53:08.829 --> 01:53:10.529]  This is the final...
[01:53:10.529 --> 01:53:11.689]  This is it.
[01:53:12.430 --> 01:53:13.789]  This is the last chance.
[01:53:14.609 --> 01:53:16.029]  Has anybody tried to push back?
[01:53:16.989 --> 01:53:18.409]  Go out and vote.
[01:53:19.369 --> 01:53:20.869]  Vote like your life depends on it.
[01:53:20.949 --> 01:53:22.050]  Vote like your future depends on it.
[01:53:22.170 --> 01:53:23.250]  Because it does.
[01:53:23.909 --> 01:53:26.829]  And there's another big factor to all of this.
[01:53:28.229 --> 01:53:29.590]  And it's not just vote.
[01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:31.250]  You have to have people informed.
[01:53:31.329 --> 01:53:34.050]  And once Trump gets in, they're going to give us total hell.
[01:53:34.210 --> 01:53:35.489]  We've got to understand their tricks.
[01:53:35.689 --> 01:53:51.989]  We've got to educate the other pundits like Musk and Rogan and everybody else on the game plan so that we can continue to be able to To beat them by admitting how evil they are, admitting how corrupt they are,
[01:53:52.109 --> 01:53:55.170]  admitting how out of control they are, and how bad they are.
[01:53:55.229 --> 01:53:58.609]  But if you sit there and are naive, it is not going to work.
[01:53:58.750 --> 01:53:59.590]  Let's try this again.
[01:53:59.829 --> 01:54:01.369]  Gavin, are we winning?
[01:54:02.899 --> 01:54:04.420]  Yes, we're absolutely winning.
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:11.140]  We can see with the early voting that Kamala is just squeaking ahead, but early voting isn't our thing.
[01:54:11.779 --> 01:54:14.659]  You know, blue-collar dudes, they vote today, they vote right now.
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:18.779]  So we've already won, and it's going to be too big to rig.
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:25.600]  I'm seeing a total political realignment, and their attempts and all their propaganda has totally backfired.
[01:54:25.699 --> 01:54:26.220]  Do you agree with that?
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:28.079]  Absolutely.
[01:54:28.319 --> 01:54:30.479]  But I think they gave up a long time ago.
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:31.560]  They gave up on Biden.
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:40.439]  They put a bit of money and effort behind Kamala, but there's a reason they didn't bust out their Gavin Newsom's or whoever else, because they're saving it.
[01:54:40.619 --> 01:54:45.199]  You know when you let a loser pitch in Little League because you've already lost this game?
[01:54:45.439 --> 01:54:47.000]  That's kind of where we're at.
[01:54:47.119 --> 01:54:51.979]  They're letting the losers pitch because they know they're going to get merced in the sixth inning.
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:54.640]  Absolutely.
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:55.079]  All right.
[01:54:55.199 --> 01:54:57.000]  Some stations don't join us to the next segment.
[01:54:57.159 --> 01:54:58.220]  That's a 60-second break.
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:54:59.520]  We had a little trouble at first.
[01:54:59.659 --> 01:55:05.060]  I want to come out of the gates with you to just have the floor for the next 27 minutes or so.
[01:55:05.199 --> 01:55:07.859]  Gavin McGinnis, the icon of the liberty movement.
[01:55:08.159 --> 01:55:09.819]  I just love him to death.
[01:55:09.939 --> 01:55:13.340]  This is an OG. And by the way, I'm very excited.
[01:55:13.939 --> 01:55:15.960]  You want to know my prediction for what's about to happen?
[01:55:15.979 --> 01:55:16.699]  It's on screen.
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:17.720]  They're going to try to steal it.
[01:55:17.819 --> 01:55:18.579]  They are trying to steal it.
[01:55:18.579 --> 01:55:19.340]  They've been caught red-handed.
[01:55:19.739 --> 01:55:21.300]  It's all blowing up in their face.
[01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:24.439]  It's forced people to just totally turn against the system.
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:28.300]  They're talking about banning fluoride and banning vaccines and arresting Bill Gates.
[01:55:28.659 --> 01:55:33.880]  It's like the whole world's becoming Gavin McGinnis and Alex Jones.
[01:55:34.079 --> 01:55:35.619]  And Gavin's been fighting these guys for decades.
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:37.380]  So have I. Gavin...
[01:55:39.659 --> 01:55:40.399]  I love you, brother.
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:42.279]  Censored program.
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:43.460]  Censored.tv.
[01:55:43.619 --> 01:55:45.279]  We're two of the most censored people in the world because...
[01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:47.430]  They knew we were bringing it.
[01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:48.649]  They know you've changed culture.
[01:55:48.649 --> 01:55:49.510]  I've changed culture.
[01:55:49.630 --> 01:55:50.170]  It's not about bragging.
[01:55:50.289 --> 01:55:50.869]  It's why they hate us.
[01:55:51.010 --> 01:55:52.329]  They know we can move the needle.
[01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:53.729]  We can cut through.
[01:55:54.029 --> 01:55:56.689]  You've got everybody now basically endorsing Trump.
[01:55:56.890 --> 01:56:02.149]  It is just insanely beautiful that folks get this.
[01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:06.689]  RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, Hulk Hogan, Dr.
[01:56:06.810 --> 01:56:10.090]  Phil, Buzz Aldrin, the head of Black Lives Matter.
[01:56:10.270 --> 01:56:12.149]  What in the hell is going on?
[01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:13.489]  But we can't get too positive.
[01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:17.409]  What are the bad guys going to do as they see it all slipping away?
[01:56:17.529 --> 01:56:18.170]  Gavin McGinnis.
[01:56:19.909 --> 01:56:22.430]  Well, I don't even think they're going to try to cheat that much.
[01:56:22.590 --> 01:56:25.470]  As I was saying earlier, they've accepted this as a loss.
[01:56:25.609 --> 01:56:28.670]  And you're already seeing cheaters get caught in Portland.
[01:56:29.090 --> 01:56:31.770]  And I think Georgia was reporting some issues.
[01:56:33.170 --> 01:56:37.329]  Mariscopa County is getting bullied by everyone on Twitter going, why is it taking you so long?
[01:56:38.250 --> 01:56:39.989]  Florida's got 9 million people.
[01:56:40.090 --> 01:56:41.130]  They do it that night.
[01:56:41.769 --> 01:56:54.789]  And I think they're already sort of trying to come across as fair, which is why they are allowing us to catch them cheating, because this is a mulligan, and they've accepted that they've lost.
[01:56:54.949 --> 01:56:58.689]  And I think it's interesting to look at why they've lost.
[01:56:58.930 --> 01:57:01.369]  Like, there's been no discussion of policies.
[01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:06.750]  Her only policies are child tax and no tax on tips and Trump things.
[01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:11.130]  So these people who love her, they don't like her policies.
[01:57:11.130 --> 01:57:12.510]  They don't dislike Trump's policies.
[01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:14.649]  They just have Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:57:14.810 --> 01:57:20.069]  And I think it's worth psychoanalyzing that because my belief is that it's daddy issues.
[01:57:20.210 --> 01:57:22.970]  And Trump represents bedtime issues.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:23.600]  Come on, guys.
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:24.500]  Get off your phones.
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:25.079]  It's bedtime.
[01:57:25.239 --> 01:57:26.159]  You got school tomorrow.
[01:57:26.380 --> 01:57:28.060]  He represents eating your vegetables.
[01:57:28.319 --> 01:57:36.699]  He represents the self-indulgent multiple pronoun blue hair game is over and it's time to do your homework.
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:39.680]  And spoiled brat Americans cannot handle that.
[01:57:41.779 --> 01:57:42.399]  I agree.
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:45.619]  You know, they've been pre-programming that Trump's gonna blow everything up and kill everybody.
[01:57:45.619 --> 01:57:47.020]  I'm worried about false flags.
[01:57:47.239 --> 01:57:49.479]  Now they've got new articles of impeachment drafted up.
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:50.180]  It's being reported.
[01:57:51.239 --> 01:57:53.359]  Look, yeah, we're winning the culture war big time.
[01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:54.439]  I mean, it's spectacular.
[01:57:54.439 --> 01:57:55.180]  It's exponential.
[01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:55.720]  But...
[01:57:57.020 --> 01:58:06.920]  Once he's president-elect for 78 days, they're promising violence, insanity, and they never get held accountable because they control the blue cities and the DAs won't prosecute them.
[01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:08.560]  So what do we do about that?
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:11.439]  And what are you predicting the temper tantrums going to be like?
[01:58:12.850 --> 01:58:22.550]  Well, we'll probably get some BLM riots, some Antifa riots, some bricks through mom and pop's windows, even though they don't have insurance and that costs them their entire net for the week.
[01:58:22.649 --> 01:58:27.010]  It's bullying the working class is really what these riots are.
[01:58:27.130 --> 01:58:28.590]  Starbucks and Citibank can handle it.
[01:58:28.670 --> 01:58:30.069]  So we will see a bit of that.
[01:58:30.819 --> 01:58:32.680]  They've already had temper tantrums.
[01:58:32.739 --> 01:58:33.819]  The boys already cried wolf.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.180]  So what are you going to do?
[01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:36.100]  Wreck Portland?
[01:58:36.380 --> 01:58:38.020]  You're going to wreck Philadelphia?
[01:58:38.359 --> 01:58:39.779]  You're going to wreck New York?
[01:58:39.979 --> 01:58:41.920]  You're going to destroy the south side of Chicago?
[01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:43.859]  Is anything left in Ferguson?
[01:58:44.220 --> 01:58:45.640]  So go ahead and write.
[01:58:45.779 --> 01:58:47.279]  We've all written off those cities.
[01:58:47.739 --> 01:58:52.039]  You can't even buy deodorant at CVS without going to get an employee.
[01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:55.020]  So you're trashing cities that have been abandoned.
[01:58:55.159 --> 01:58:57.760]  This is like trashing the city and escape from New York.
[01:58:58.119 --> 01:58:59.100]  Nobody cares.
[01:59:01.230 --> 01:59:02.170]  I totally agree.
[01:59:02.569 --> 01:59:09.970]  So, I always ask the questions here, and I got a lot of them, but what are you telling your audience?
[01:59:10.170 --> 01:59:16.930]  I mean, what do you think is most important right now, and what do you think Trump's agenda, we know what it is once he gets in, how do we keep the swamp from infiltrating this time?
[01:59:18.170 --> 01:59:25.630]  Welcome to my show!
[01:59:35.989 --> 01:59:41.050]  They're all saying the same things, which is Proud Boys, you see, they were told to stand back and stand by.
[01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:46.310]  So they're looming in the bushes like a Michael Jackson video, like Beat It.
[01:59:46.630 --> 01:59:49.409]  And then there's going to be some sort of signal.
[01:59:49.609 --> 01:59:56.310]  I don't know if it's going to be a bat signal in the sky or if Trump is going to send out a tweet going, no.
[01:59:57.189 --> 02:00:04.890]  But they are convinced, and I think if they just watch too many movies, that Trump is going to do some sort of Mad Max, like, Snap of the fingers.
[02:00:05.130 --> 02:00:05.590]  It's on.
[02:00:05.810 --> 02:00:19.750]  And then the stand-back standbys will respond by not just destroying America, but like killing trans and rounding up liberals and sending them to re-education camps.
[02:00:19.930 --> 02:00:22.229]  And I hear all this shit and I'm like, I wish...
[02:00:25.010 --> 02:00:25.850]  Oh my gosh.
[02:00:26.050 --> 02:00:28.430]  You know, it's just wild.
[02:00:28.649 --> 02:00:30.229]  There's two clips today that go together.
[02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:37.850]  Manow comes out and says the government will have to go after Elon Musk and shut down his companies for what he's done.
[02:00:37.850 --> 02:00:40.829]  So that's a serious, super hardcore totalitarian statement.
[02:00:41.289 --> 02:00:47.170]  Documents came out two weeks ago, and I've told everybody this, because our agencies will contract with foreign agencies and do illegal stuff.
[02:00:47.710 --> 02:00:51.909]  So the U.S. suppresses the Brits and people in the U.K., then they suppress us.
[02:00:52.090 --> 02:00:55.550]  It's like the Steele dossier, but MI6 going after Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:00:55.750 --> 02:01:04.689]  through front companies, MI6 going after Elon Musk, working with Kamala Harris' campaign, how they're going to shut down X once she wins.
[02:01:05.050 --> 02:01:08.710]  I mean, this is not just our own agencies domestically illegally operating.
[02:01:08.869 --> 02:01:12.770]  This has all come out in Congress with weaponization hearings that you and I already knew and told people.
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:19.119]  But now it's foreign governments and then Maddow salivating.
[02:01:19.239 --> 02:01:25.739]  And then they have the nerve to turn around and say Trump, in another clip, is going to burn books and ban historians.
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:29.939]  And meanwhile, we're only saying don't give eight-year-olds pedophile books.
[02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:32.060]  I mean, it's like saying we're going to ban alcohol.
[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:33.880]  No, just don't give it to people under 21.
[02:01:34.579 --> 02:01:37.979]  So it's just they're claiming everything about us.
[02:01:38.039 --> 02:01:40.760]  And I know I'm stating the obvious, but it's just so ridiculous.
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:42.739]  No one believes this shit anymore.
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:46.520]  Yeah, they're the ones who committed law fairs.
[02:01:46.619 --> 02:01:49.600]  They're the ones who jailed their political opponents.
[02:01:50.199 --> 02:01:52.220]  This talk of they might riot.
[02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:56.180]  All you guys did was riot nonstop for two years.
[02:01:56.319 --> 02:02:01.479]  And there's this perpetual fear that we are going to sin, that we're going to take away your rights.
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:03.119]  Trump's been in office for four years.
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:05.680]  Again, nothing they say makes any sense.
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:14.899]  And every time you try to impose logic on them and say, give me a policy, give me an actual quote, things Trump said, give me some concrete evidence, they never can.
[02:02:14.899 --> 02:02:17.500]  They just go, it's going to be hell on earth.
[02:02:17.659 --> 02:02:24.899]  And that's how I get to this conclusion that, you know, it's just going to be us shrugging.
[02:02:25.039 --> 02:02:28.260]  Like if Kamala wins, which isn't going to happen, there will be no rise.
[02:02:28.420 --> 02:02:29.939]  They'll just be like, well, you blew it.
[02:02:30.489 --> 02:02:37.470]  Like if a kid, if a teenager trashed his car on purpose just to spite you, you'd just go, well, there goes your car, dummy.
[02:02:38.109 --> 02:02:41.550]  You screwed up, and that's who they are.
[02:02:42.289 --> 02:02:58.250]  I always go with my gut, and we now know from science that the gut is not the gut, though your stomach is connected to your spinal cord, it's connected to your brain, and so obviously the organs are communicating, but the gut is your manifestation, your brain telling your stomach to pay attention,
[02:02:58.930 --> 02:03:10.289]  It's not the other way around, and they've proven that scientifically, that the unconscious and then the subconscious above that is way more powerful than your limited cerebral cortex, what you're focused on.
[02:03:10.770 --> 02:03:13.590]  Hundreds, if not thousands of times, depending on the person.
[02:03:13.789 --> 02:03:22.029]  And so your gut knows Trump is going to win, because it's not just your gut, it's aggregating all these billions of pieces of data.
[02:03:22.029 --> 02:03:25.029]  You're a supercomputer, and then it tells you the answer.
[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:27.079]  So yes, my gut's never wrong.
[02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:30.380]  And at 50, I've learned to basically follow it all the time.
[02:03:30.659 --> 02:03:33.899]  He was always right when I was a kid, a teenager, 25, 30, 40.
[02:03:34.180 --> 02:03:35.300]  My gut's never wrong.
[02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:36.720]  The damn thing's dead on.
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:39.520]  And that's really my unconscious and subconscious and my spirit.
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:43.119]  But my gut says 100% like you're saying...
[02:03:43.979 --> 02:03:44.960]  But there's a paradox.
[02:03:45.199 --> 02:03:46.579]  Yeah, we feel the Great Awakening.
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:49.180]  We feel that he's really going to win probably 70% of the voters.
[02:03:49.239 --> 02:03:50.720]  They're going to mitigate it with fraud.
[02:03:51.199 --> 02:03:54.359]  But then there's also this duality of the fraud.
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:56.000]  They are trying to steal it.
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:57.779]  Why are you...
[02:03:57.779 --> 02:04:00.359]  Even Trump this weekend was like, I'm not confident they won't steal it.
[02:04:00.399 --> 02:04:05.699]  Yeah, I know we're winning, but because of all the stuff we see, why are you so certain?
[02:04:05.859 --> 02:04:08.800]  And everybody else I talk to, it seems to be so...
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:10.479]  And I feel totally certain as well.
[02:04:12.199 --> 02:04:12.619]  The gut.
[02:04:12.939 --> 02:04:16.340]  I mean, it's not just our subconscious and our conscious mind.
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:22.859]  I was arguing with this sort of internet influencer kid yesterday or Saturday, and these kids, they don't get out.
[02:04:22.979 --> 02:04:24.760]  They don't talk to their cab drivers.
[02:04:24.979 --> 02:04:33.159]  They don't go to a bar and shoot the shit with some lineman who just got back from, you know, West Virginia or South Carolina.
[02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:35.340]  So they can't gauge things.
[02:04:35.539 --> 02:04:38.239]  I love talking to things like truckers.
[02:04:38.359 --> 02:04:40.680]  Talk to truckers and ask them about port-a-potties.
[02:04:41.039 --> 02:04:42.720]  And the graffiti in porta-potties.
[02:04:43.079 --> 02:04:48.920]  And they would say, well, Trump usually wins with porta-potties, but Hillary had a few things up there with union guys.
[02:04:49.079 --> 02:04:54.020]  But this election, all of the graffiti in all the porta-potties is all Trump, Trump, Trump.
[02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:57.760]  Here's another silly metric, but they add up.
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:05:02.220]  You talk to an amateur comedian who's just driving around the country in a Honda Civic.
[02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:03.600]  He's going to upstate New York.
[02:05:03.659 --> 02:05:04.920]  He's across the desert.
[02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:06.239]  He's in rural California.
[02:05:06.579 --> 02:05:08.579]  And you talk to those guys and they say...
[02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:12.779]  Couple Kamala flags only in very affluent neighborhoods.
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.880]  Otherwise, 100% Trump everywhere you go.
[02:05:16.340 --> 02:05:19.319]  Way less Kamala flags than Hillary flags.
[02:05:19.539 --> 02:05:29.180]  And as you say, you accrue these different metrics all over the place talking to people, and you end up with this hunch that is actually based on a million data points.
[02:05:30.140 --> 02:05:34.560]  And I knew Biden was not going to have two terms from day one.
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:36.899]  I physically couldn't picture it.
[02:05:36.979 --> 02:05:39.579]  I've got a very vivid imagination, but I just couldn't picture it.
[02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:40.979]  So I knew Biden wasn't going to win.
[02:05:41.119 --> 02:05:42.500]  And you can just feel...
[02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:44.819]  I wore this exact outfit eight years ago.
[02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:48.979]  When we had an election night party for Trump's first victory.
[02:05:49.220 --> 02:05:52.279]  And it feels like the exact same night.
[02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:55.039]  The same vibe, the same energy everywhere you go.
[02:05:55.140 --> 02:05:58.180]  And by the way, General Flynn, I've interviewed him probably 30 times.
[02:05:58.819 --> 02:06:01.159]  He's never said my gut, my instinct.
[02:06:01.359 --> 02:06:03.819]  He said, I haven't felt this since election night eight years ago.
[02:06:04.100 --> 02:06:04.880]  He said...
[02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:10.760]  I can look at all the data as the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, but he said it's the gut.
[02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:14.800]  He said they're going to try to steal it so it won't look like a landslide.
[02:06:15.319 --> 02:06:16.539]  That's what my gut says.
[02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:25.020]  It's going to be narrow, but he's going to win, and it's just going to be spectacular what these lunatics are going to do.
[02:06:25.119 --> 02:06:26.520]  I mean, I am just so sick of them.
[02:06:27.399 --> 02:06:39.800]  Is it possible that they are going by that strong men create good times, and then good times create weak men, weak men create hard times, hard times create hard men, that whole thing?
[02:06:40.039 --> 02:06:44.279]  Is it possible that they're like, look, we're weak, we've created some hard times.
[02:06:44.750 --> 02:06:47.590]  Let's get a hard man in there, as they call them in Scotland.
[02:06:47.829 --> 02:06:49.750]  He'll clean up this mess we made.
[02:06:49.909 --> 02:06:52.289]  And then in four years, we'll be affluent.
[02:06:52.369 --> 02:06:53.430]  We'll have oil.
[02:06:53.630 --> 02:06:54.850]  People will be in a good mood.
[02:06:55.029 --> 02:06:56.109]  They'll feel like experimenting.
[02:06:56.449 --> 02:07:04.949]  And then I can put in my Gavin Newsom or my, God forbid, Pete Buttigieg or AOC or someone when I have some, like, breathing room.
[02:07:05.050 --> 02:07:13.930]  But right now, they know that They've destroyed America too much, and they need us to fix it before they can try to sabotage it again.
[02:07:14.350 --> 02:07:15.270]  Well, absolutely.
[02:07:15.489 --> 02:07:17.369]  So what do you think the establishment's doing?
[02:07:17.409 --> 02:07:21.050]  Because they've legitimately come after Trump and you and I. They've tried to put us all in prison.
[02:07:21.770 --> 02:07:23.550]  I'm not going to whine about it, but I mean...
[02:07:23.579 --> 02:07:24.819]  Listeners, you don't know 10%.
[02:07:24.819 --> 02:07:26.920]  I know Gavin is the same as we've hung out and talked.
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:28.539]  Because we're men.
[02:07:28.739 --> 02:07:29.819]  We got in this game.
[02:07:29.939 --> 02:07:31.140]  We're big boys.
[02:07:31.239 --> 02:07:33.520]  So we don't spend all day about what's happening to us.
[02:07:33.619 --> 02:07:36.840]  But it is spectacular how bad these people are.
[02:07:37.079 --> 02:07:41.039]  And they really are losing big time, the hearts and minds.
[02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:43.630]  And They failed.
[02:07:43.770 --> 02:07:50.829]  And so I start wondering, what are the Black Rocks and the Klaus Schwab's who had to step down this year and the Bill Gates's that, you know, is falling apart?
[02:07:51.770 --> 02:07:57.670]  Are they crazy enough to release one of the real super viruses they've got that they've been prepping and saying is imminent?
[02:07:57.890 --> 02:08:11.010]  So as positive as I am picking up the signs of an awakening, I don't want to have a blind spot to understand, well, you also got crazy people that'll burn the world down If they can't control it, so I mean, come on, look into your black pill zones.
[02:08:11.090 --> 02:08:17.810]  I agree, I'm all white pill right now, but I don't want to get caught because I got so many good data points and kind of get drunk on that mentally, spiritually.
[02:08:18.489 --> 02:08:26.550]  What about, just kind of use the reptile part of your brain, and I guess that's actually the more emotional one.
[02:08:26.829 --> 02:08:32.649]  Use the analytical part, just cold-bloodedly, and I mean, is there any ace card they've got?
[02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:36.380]  I think they do have ace cards.
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:38.859]  I think they could do another COVID. They could do a million things.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:45.399]  They deprived the survivors of the hurricane any kind of infrastructure in order to make them unable to vote.
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:47.920]  But we're down to the last 12 hours.
[02:08:48.460 --> 02:08:51.199]  And they've given up on total sabotage.
[02:08:51.359 --> 02:08:56.359]  Next four years, they can unleash another COVID. There's a lot that can happen in the next four years.
[02:08:56.479 --> 02:08:57.939]  But they're kind of done with this.
[02:08:58.039 --> 02:09:03.119]  And one thing I want to remind you of, I'm sure you remember this, but we won in 2016.
[02:09:04.289 --> 02:09:06.729]  We felt like gods for the first six months.
[02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:17.350]  Proud Boys had a vigil in Times Square on all of our friends who died of winning AIDS. Because they got so sick of winning, they got winning AIDS. Those are the kind of jokes we were doing.
[02:09:17.689 --> 02:09:18.550]  Having a great time.
[02:09:19.010 --> 02:09:20.949]  And then the TDS really kicked in.
[02:09:21.090 --> 02:09:24.550]  And I remember Jim Goad called me and he goes, Can you believe we won?
[02:09:25.060 --> 02:09:26.560]  It doesn't feel like it.
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:32.939]  And then I realized just because your king is in the castle doesn't mean everyone in the castle wants him dead.
[02:09:32.939 --> 02:09:36.680]  So it's the sort of Damocles in a very literal sense.
[02:09:36.899 --> 02:09:39.180]  They have tried to kill him twice now.
[02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:47.680]  So just because we're going to win tonight, when January rolls around, don't think like the J6ers are going to get released that afternoon.
[02:09:47.939 --> 02:09:52.420]  Like there's still going to be some major problems because the deep state is deep.
[02:09:53.010 --> 02:09:56.510]  It is full of demonic vermin.
[02:09:56.729 --> 02:09:58.649]  And they're not going to be kicked out overnight.
[02:10:00.010 --> 02:10:00.829]  Well, that's right.
[02:10:00.829 --> 02:10:02.350]  And that's what General Flynn said.
[02:10:02.590 --> 02:10:06.010]  And again, we're all finishing each other's sentences because we're veterans of this.
[02:10:06.130 --> 02:10:06.909]  And so are the listeners.
[02:10:07.090 --> 02:10:21.029]  We're all veterans of a bioattack and a poison shot and sabotaging the economy and the government trying to demoralize us and Hollywood attacking us and trying to make a race war and turning off our systems and jacking up energy prices.
[02:10:21.250 --> 02:10:23.069]  And I mean, they've been in economic war with us.
[02:10:23.130 --> 02:10:24.449]  The Great Reset trying to break us.
[02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:29.289]  But as I always said, if we point out they're the ones doing it to us, Then they're not the saviors.
[02:10:29.390 --> 02:10:31.130]  They don't get the power in the Great Reset.
[02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:33.310]  It ends up destroying them instead of us.
[02:10:33.409 --> 02:10:34.229]  That's how this works.
[02:10:34.449 --> 02:10:38.829]  So we cannot sit around and go to Mar-a-Lago and wear tuxedos all day.
[02:10:38.890 --> 02:10:39.810]  I'm not saying that can happen to some.
[02:10:40.029 --> 02:10:41.229]  And just celebrate it.
[02:10:41.369 --> 02:10:42.189]  Oh, our guy's in.
[02:10:42.210 --> 02:10:42.609]  It's great.
[02:10:42.810 --> 02:10:43.149]  No.
[02:10:43.550 --> 02:10:47.250]  We're winning the main strategic battle, but we've got to finish the war.
[02:10:47.350 --> 02:10:48.250]  What does that look like?
[02:10:48.329 --> 02:10:50.250]  Because they always say...
[02:10:50.579 --> 02:10:52.840]  This will discredit you if you do it because they're afraid of it.
[02:10:52.939 --> 02:10:53.000]  No.
[02:10:53.340 --> 02:10:57.060]  Trump has a responsibility to prosecute the leadership of the globalists.
[02:10:57.159 --> 02:11:08.039]  We have a responsibility to put them in jail for the crimes they've committed, the illegal spying, the persecution, the lawfare, the human trafficking of 325,000 kids that they didn't lose.
[02:11:08.159 --> 02:11:09.260]  They brought them in and disappeared them.
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:11.539]  We need to find those kids.
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:13.159]  That can be Trump's real...
[02:11:13.670 --> 02:11:29.609]  Real, you know, right thing to do, but also everybody gets behind it, and then we're going to find the kids, and we're going to prosecute those involved, and that's Biden, Mayorkas, those, the NGOs, Kamala, and he goes after him on that, and then he brings down the whole deep state, the whole P. Diddy cult,
[02:11:29.710 --> 02:11:36.729]  and then, and from there, what do we, describe, because look, let's, look, we can't let the enemy reconstitute if we win, okay, which we are.
[02:11:37.060 --> 02:11:39.520]  And we have to do it judiciously, legally, and lawfully.
[02:11:39.659 --> 02:11:40.380]  They get trials.
[02:11:40.539 --> 02:11:41.000]  They get it all.
[02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:42.319]  But let's just be honest.
[02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:46.319]  He can't sit there and give them amnesty after this.
[02:11:46.539 --> 02:11:47.880]  I said this in the last year.
[02:11:48.020 --> 02:11:49.079]  I said, roll over now.
[02:11:49.479 --> 02:11:50.159]  Zuckerberg did.
[02:11:50.420 --> 02:11:53.279]  Run up the white flag now, and then you can go.
[02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:55.420]  Okay, we already had the amnesty period.
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:58.920]  For the hardcore globalists, there cannot be an amnesty.
[02:11:59.060 --> 02:11:59.939]  Do you agree, Gavin McGinnis?
[02:12:00.699 --> 02:12:01.680]  I agree 100%.
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:10.159]  And stop saying that that bill, not you, but that bill was there to solve the problem, and Trump rejected it because he wanted the problem to remain unsolved.
[02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:12.340]  You didn't provide a solution to the problem.
[02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:16.460]  That bill that you proposed had $100 billion earmarked for Ukraine.
[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:25.560]  Even when you allegedly stripped it down, the bill was just more asylum processors, more quote-unquote judges, they're not even judges, and more people...
[02:12:26.109 --> 02:12:26.970]  To come in here.
[02:12:27.090 --> 02:12:30.850]  So you can't give me 12 million illegals in four years.
[02:12:30.850 --> 02:12:32.149]  And I go, hey, that's too much.
[02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:33.949]  And you go, well, let me process them.
[02:12:34.069 --> 02:12:40.949]  It's sort of like in Saudi Arabia, they bought the Taliban a soccer field, the UN did, and said, you guys can play sports here.
[02:12:41.069 --> 02:12:43.590]  And they started hanging women from the goalposts.
[02:12:43.989 --> 02:12:47.090]  And the UN goes, hey, that's not what we got you that for.
[02:12:47.329 --> 02:12:50.789]  And they go, well, give us some gallows where we can hang women.
[02:12:50.890 --> 02:12:52.829]  This is the only thing we have.
[02:12:53.050 --> 02:12:53.250]  Yeah.
[02:12:53.890 --> 02:13:00.510]  So, every time they get something, they crowbar it into their perverted way.
[02:13:00.590 --> 02:13:03.090]  It's like Palestinians spending their money on weapons.
[02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:05.430]  So, we can't trust them.
[02:13:05.590 --> 02:13:14.670]  And it's going to be a good four years of discipline and telling kids that meritocracy is back and it's bedtime.
[02:13:14.949 --> 02:13:16.590]  You gotta eat your vegetables.
[02:13:18.210 --> 02:13:18.869]  Gavin?
[02:13:25.759 --> 02:13:30.600]  Can I add something here?
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:32.819]  Here's something that drives me nuts about the left.
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:39.020]  They think that there's Fox News, there's InfoWars, there's Daily Wire, the media is all conservative.
[02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:39.489]  No.
[02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:44.710]  The only media, right-wing media, that is not throttled is Fox News.
[02:13:44.850 --> 02:13:45.470]  That's one.
[02:13:45.630 --> 02:13:47.350]  They have all of the rest.
[02:13:47.489 --> 02:13:48.770]  They have all of academia.
[02:13:48.930 --> 02:13:51.069]  They have the entire justice system.
[02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:54.770]  They have the top brass of the FDNY, all the cops and firemen.
[02:13:54.869 --> 02:13:56.789]  They own all the tops of that.
[02:13:57.010 --> 02:14:01.920]  And For a while, we didn't even have Fox News and we were pushed into talk radio.
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:03.260]  And what did we get from that?
[02:14:03.359 --> 02:14:04.420]  We got Rush Limbaugh.
[02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:09.460]  They gatekeeped the media so much that Infowars had to hide underground.
[02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:16.819]  And now I think young people especially have realized that those gatekeepers are A, 90% left.
[02:14:17.350 --> 02:14:19.510]  And be terrible at their jobs.
[02:14:19.829 --> 02:14:22.210]  So this really is our time.
[02:14:22.350 --> 02:14:24.390]  Because we were right all along.
[02:14:24.529 --> 02:14:27.229]  We kept telling them that Charlottesville was a trap.
[02:14:27.430 --> 02:14:29.890]  I kept telling them that January 6th was a trap.
[02:14:30.109 --> 02:14:33.510]  I kept warning them that they're never going to get a fair trial.
[02:14:33.710 --> 02:14:34.710]  And they didn't.
[02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:37.609]  And I think young people especially are turning around going, wow.
[02:14:38.449 --> 02:14:40.210]  Fox News is even mainstream.
[02:14:40.869 --> 02:14:49.609]  It's these alternative news sources that are getting it right every time because they talk to people and they know people and they don't make their career Googling.
[02:14:49.970 --> 02:14:51.109]  Endless Googling.
[02:14:51.649 --> 02:15:09.710]  You were the first person I heard had to be 15 years ago, I've been interviewed that long, that said the populist conservative anti-establishment movement is the real Sex Pistols Johnny Rotten And then later he said that,
[02:15:09.810 --> 02:15:12.550]  and now Joe Rogan says that, and now Elon Musk says that.
[02:15:12.829 --> 02:15:13.970]  But it really is true.
[02:15:14.109 --> 02:15:15.329]  You've always been a maverick.
[02:15:15.390 --> 02:15:16.430]  I've always been a maverick.
[02:15:16.510 --> 02:15:17.970]  And I want listeners to understand something.
[02:15:18.050 --> 02:15:19.050]  It's not about, oh, we're mavericks.
[02:15:19.470 --> 02:15:20.510]  You're mavericks, too.
[02:15:20.770 --> 02:15:21.489]  We believe in you.
[02:15:21.609 --> 02:15:29.850]  We're just populists like Gavin Sadler and more from, you know, somebody that's been fixing power cables around the country or works on cell towers or truck drivers than I learned from anybody.
[02:15:29.989 --> 02:15:31.109]  That's real knowledge.
[02:15:31.670 --> 02:15:36.109]  And that's what I'm into, not just studying the economists in the world and bills.
[02:15:36.170 --> 02:15:36.729]  I do that all.
[02:15:36.890 --> 02:15:39.310]  But you've got to have it, you know, every spectrum of it.
[02:15:39.590 --> 02:15:41.850]  And so we have been through hell.
[02:15:42.170 --> 02:15:43.989]  And quite frankly, I'm a rebel.
[02:15:44.109 --> 02:15:46.270]  I enjoyed it because listeners still supported me.
[02:15:46.329 --> 02:15:46.810]  But it was rough.
[02:15:46.909 --> 02:15:47.729]  We barely hung on.
[02:15:47.850 --> 02:15:48.729]  We're barely hanging on now.
[02:15:48.909 --> 02:15:54.010]  But it's so sweet with all this, these planets aligning to see this explosive awakening.
[02:15:54.550 --> 02:15:56.390]  And there's going to be more shots the enemy throws.
[02:15:56.529 --> 02:16:00.189]  We're not out of the woods yet, but we're winning the game by a lot of points right now.
[02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:07.569]  And so there has to be a moment of you and I here, because few people have been persecuted as much as you and I. Trump's more than us, but few others.
[02:16:09.229 --> 02:16:10.569]  Compadre, it is so good.
[02:16:11.039 --> 02:16:16.960]  To be a real Maverick and Rebel, you get to know the best Mavericks and Rebels, men and women like you, and you're right up there at the top.
[02:16:17.159 --> 02:16:19.659]  I mean, this is a great society to be in, brother.
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:23.420]  And, I mean, we are in a club where there's not memberships.
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:24.880]  You've got to go through the war to be in it.
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.220]  And we are veterans of this thing, brother, and I love you.
[02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:28.619]  I'm so proud to know you, Gavin.
[02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:29.359]  I salute you.
[02:16:29.500 --> 02:16:31.140]  We salute you, Gavin McGinnis.
[02:16:32.319 --> 02:16:33.139]  I salute you back.
[02:16:33.139 --> 02:16:36.659]  You saved me when I was at my lowest point and said we can rebuild him.
[02:16:36.799 --> 02:16:38.659]  We can rebuild the bionic man.
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:44.379]  But yeah, someone was calling me Niedermeyer the other day from Animal House and I go, who's banned from campus?
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:45.459]  We are.
[02:16:45.639 --> 02:16:47.540]  We are the Animal House guys.
[02:16:47.780 --> 02:16:48.639]  We're John Belushi.
[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:51.600]  You guys, you politically correct pronoun types.
[02:16:51.719 --> 02:16:52.899]  You're the nerds.
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:56.879]  You're the ass kissers that the dean loves because you follow the rules.
[02:16:57.479 --> 02:17:00.639]  And here we are, the guys who said, don't listen to them, they're wrong.
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:05.559]  And we're finally vindicated, and we'll be much more vindicated tonight.
[02:17:06.180 --> 02:17:06.540]  Absolutely.
[02:17:06.540 --> 02:17:09.040]  And it's not about Gavin and I saying, hey, we're OGs.
[02:17:09.479 --> 02:17:13.639]  But we're still, in ways, halfway out of the basement, clawing for survival.
[02:17:13.639 --> 02:17:14.360]  He's doing great.
[02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:15.879]  I'm telling you, we could be shut down next week.
[02:17:16.020 --> 02:17:16.379]  I am.
[02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:17.819]  It's like a pure victory.
[02:17:17.959 --> 02:17:21.159]  I've gone through the war, we're winning, and I bleed to death, so I need support.
[02:17:21.420 --> 02:17:23.020]  Gavin, how do people find your incredible show?
[02:17:24.860 --> 02:17:26.540]  Censored.tv, we're streaming live.
[02:17:26.639 --> 02:17:28.940]  We're going to be on Rumble, too, and probably Twitter.
[02:17:29.100 --> 02:17:30.500]  We're banned from YouTube, of course.
[02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:35.399]  And we'll be broadcasting the election from 6 till...
[02:17:35.399 --> 02:17:42.340]  I mean, it'll be a miracle if Arizona and Pennsylvania know at 4 a.m., but if they do, we'll be there dancing around.
[02:17:42.340 --> 02:17:43.659]  Hey, I want to pop in with you.
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:44.600]  I want you to pop in with us.
[02:17:44.719 --> 02:17:45.540]  Let's simulcast some.
[02:17:45.879 --> 02:17:46.520]  Love you, brother.
[02:17:46.860 --> 02:17:47.500]  Yeah, let's do that.
[02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:48.100]  Love you.
[02:17:48.299 --> 02:17:48.799]  What a badass.
[02:17:48.959 --> 02:17:49.319]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:49.690 --> 02:18:00.809]  As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark MAGA. A few weeks ago, when I saw Elon Musk in Pennsylvania with Trump at Butler, and he had that dark MAGA hat on, I said, we've got to have our own.
[02:18:01.110 --> 02:18:02.290]  And we've come out with it.
[02:18:02.750 --> 02:18:07.629]  Yeah, we can put one out that, you know, just says, Make America Great Again, and that's available at TheAlexShowStore.com.
[02:18:07.690 --> 02:18:09.270]  But I personally like this one.
[02:18:09.870 --> 02:18:14.549]  Murdered out, it fits great, and it funds the Infowar and supports President Trump.
[02:18:14.950 --> 02:18:17.590]  And if you don't like Murdered Out, we got it white on black.
[02:18:17.790 --> 02:18:27.850]  So get yours right now and a bunch of other great designs of hoodies and t-shirts and top of the line supplements that all fund the second American Revolution at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:18:27.909 --> 02:18:28.790]  Let me show you a few more of these.
[02:18:28.969 --> 02:18:35.450]  Now that the FDA admits fluoride does lower your IQ and give you cancer and infertility, it's a great time to wear one of these beautiful hats.
[02:18:35.709 --> 02:18:38.010]  And it's a great way to start a conversation and warn people.
[02:18:38.170 --> 02:18:40.770]  Here's the classic Make America Great Again Murdered Out.
[02:18:40.930 --> 02:18:44.549]  And we've got the Save the Frogs, over 50 designs, all at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:18:44.649 --> 02:18:46.530]  And it keeps us on air and it spreads the word.
[02:18:46.690 --> 02:18:49.170]  Please go to alexjonesstore.com and get your Patriot gear.
[02:18:51.030 --> 02:18:55.809]  Rising from the ashes of censorship, it's Alex Jones.
[02:18:56.090 --> 02:19:01.649]  All of us together are going to lift the curse off of this country and we're going to send the globalists to prison.
[02:19:02.780 --> 02:19:05.879]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:19:06.159 --> 02:19:09.700]  First they come for Alex Jones, and then they're going to come for us.
[02:19:09.799 --> 02:19:13.040]  And they try to bankrupt Alex Jones or try to put Alex Jones in prison.
[02:19:13.239 --> 02:19:20.040]  The demonization of Alex Jones should be of profound interest to everybody all across the board, even progressives.
[02:19:20.239 --> 02:19:21.760]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:19:21.940 --> 02:19:24.879]  Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago.
[02:19:25.139 --> 02:19:25.559]  Listen!
[02:19:25.860 --> 02:19:31.479]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one!
[02:19:37.979 --> 02:19:42.719]  The Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.
[02:19:54.100 --> 02:20:01.879]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[02:20:02.059 --> 02:20:16.020]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[02:20:17.210 --> 02:20:20.069]  Transdimensionally over the space-time continuum through full space.
[02:20:20.290 --> 02:20:24.610]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[02:20:24.850 --> 02:20:28.829]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:42.620]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life and that it's fulfilling to be informed.
[02:20:42.639 --> 02:20:44.520]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[02:20:44.739 --> 02:20:45.739]  It's fulfilling.
[02:20:46.260 --> 02:20:46.799]  InfoWars.
[02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:48.500]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:20:51.500 --> 02:20:56.840]  It's live election day coverage on the InfoWars stream on X and InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:20:57.239 --> 02:20:58.860]  Share the link everywhere.
[02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:00.559]  Let's get 100 million watching.
[02:21:00.899 --> 02:21:04.219]  We had just 40 million last week, and one day, do it.
[02:21:04.500 --> 02:21:08.139]  Real Alex Jones, B. Paul Revere, the enemy hates you.
[02:21:09.799 --> 02:21:12.260]  It's one small step for a man.
[02:21:12.420 --> 02:21:13.239]  They hate your will.
[02:21:13.579 --> 02:21:14.760]  One giant leap for a man.
[02:21:15.020 --> 02:21:15.420]  Music.
[02:21:16.319 --> 02:21:16.819]  One minute.
[02:21:17.659 --> 02:21:18.360]  Someone's here.
[02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:28.100]  Gavin was getting ready to clip.
[02:21:28.340 --> 02:21:29.540]  They're trying to put him in prison.
[02:21:29.719 --> 02:21:36.520]  Shut him down and I played this on air live and then talked about Gavin McGinnis instead of Steve Austin.
[02:21:37.239 --> 02:21:38.219]  We can rebuild him.
[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:45.700]  And if they shut us down next week, you're gonna have to rebuild us.
[02:21:49.189 --> 02:21:51.829]  If you stand with me, we're unstoppable.
[02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:55.010]  I'll do anything to beat these people.
[02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:56.569]  But I need you.
[02:22:00.069 --> 02:22:02.389]  I launched this operation 30 plus years ago.
[02:22:03.010 --> 02:22:05.450]  I told you for decades we could do it.
[02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:06.649]  And we've turned the tide.
[02:22:07.709 --> 02:22:10.090]  We're winning the war, but we've not won yet.
[02:22:11.409 --> 02:22:12.569]  We have the initiative.
[02:22:31.909 --> 02:22:33.469]  Steve Austin.
[02:22:33.829 --> 02:22:34.709]  Astronaut.
[02:22:34.930 --> 02:22:36.709]  A man barely alive.
[02:22:52.659 --> 02:22:55.760]  Steve Austin will be that man.
[02:22:56.959 --> 02:22:58.899]  Better than he was before.
[02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:04.399]  Better, stronger, faster.
[02:23:09.659 --> 02:23:21.920]  Now, the archetype of Steve Austin Barely alive, rebuilt, is the archetype of Trump, is the archetype of myself, is the archetype of America, is the archetype of you.
[02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:24.780]  Because people can die, but countries can come back.
[02:23:24.920 --> 02:23:26.440]  But you've got to believe it.
[02:23:26.559 --> 02:23:32.379]  It's all about spirit and will and policies and agendas and understanding history.
[02:23:32.819 --> 02:23:33.739]  It's happening.
[02:23:34.180 --> 02:23:36.100]  Because Trump was willing to die.
[02:23:36.379 --> 02:23:38.799]  Because you were willing to speak the truth.
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:42.920]  Because you backed people that stood for your values.
[02:23:49.149 --> 02:23:49.670]  Yes.
[02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:52.530]  We will turn the tide, as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:23:52.770 --> 02:23:55.149]  said, for our children and the future.
[02:23:56.569 --> 02:23:57.090]  But...
[02:23:59.269 --> 02:24:09.110]  We're facing, up for auction, Soros' pledge through Media Matters to buy it and shut this building, this equipment, and our satellite uplinks and the servers down.
[02:24:10.129 --> 02:24:16.549]  And without getting into a long story, and I'm going to get back on the news and all the breaking stuff and open the phones up and take your calls.
[02:24:16.590 --> 02:24:18.969]  Another big guest coming up and we'll be here right through midnight tonight.
[02:24:19.370 --> 02:24:20.229]  You're on the feed.
[02:24:20.329 --> 02:24:20.729]  It's here.
[02:24:20.889 --> 02:24:21.569]  Boom, share it.
[02:24:21.729 --> 02:24:22.969]  The power of you is everything.
[02:24:23.489 --> 02:24:25.129]  Take action now, now, now.
[02:24:30.540 --> 02:24:41.200]  If I tried to tell you all the stuff and what they've done to my family and all the rest of it, just like I saw Eric Trump a year ago on TV and he said, listen, I played the clip a few times.
[02:24:41.860 --> 02:24:46.459]  He said, for every one thing you hear about, there's at least nine or ten others that you don't know about.
[02:24:47.659 --> 02:24:52.280]  And I've experienced what they do at a lower level.
[02:24:52.739 --> 02:24:54.260]  And it's insane.
[02:24:56.620 --> 02:25:09.379]  The Southern Poverty Law Center that's really the CIA... Went and contacted a bunch of the current employees and found one who'd been here previously who quit to go take a better job.
[02:25:09.579 --> 02:25:10.739]  He asked for his job back.
[02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:11.379]  We get him in here.
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:15.120]  For two years, he's hacked into the security cameras in the building.
[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:33.870]  Overwhelming evidence was he tried to get into everything else but wasn't able to and had nothing but me one late night show because I took my dress shirt off and walked down the hall because I'd left my other shirt in the bathroom And I had a bottle of vodka in my hand.
[02:25:34.430 --> 02:25:37.309]  And they leaked that on the internet like that was their two-year investigation.
[02:25:37.790 --> 02:25:47.430]  In our office, that's just one little example of look at this guy with his potbelly and his bottle of vodka after he worked 16 hours.
[02:25:49.510 --> 02:25:51.729]  So that's the best you got because that's about it.
[02:25:51.829 --> 02:25:52.510]  I don't even drink anymore.
[02:25:53.689 --> 02:25:54.510]  So, yeah.
[02:25:55.549 --> 02:26:06.649]  Imagine, they're in here two years, and they got another one to do it, and he wrote stuff at the New York Times, and he was only here a few years as a camera guy, and after he was gone, people said, well, we didn't want to tell you to stir up trouble, because nobody does that around here.
[02:26:06.729 --> 02:26:07.329]  They're not gossips.
[02:26:08.010 --> 02:26:11.889]  He would go into the offices and be on road trips to do reports.
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:16.239]  And he'd go, you know, I don't like the N-words to our crew.
[02:26:16.319 --> 02:26:16.780]  They'd be like, what?
[02:26:16.899 --> 02:26:17.819]  We don't dislike black people.
[02:26:18.219 --> 02:26:19.739]  Yeah, and of course he was recording them.
[02:26:20.899 --> 02:26:23.799]  And there was a black lady who worked here.
[02:26:23.879 --> 02:26:24.719]  She did the same thing.
[02:26:25.180 --> 02:26:26.659]  And then lied about me in the news.
[02:26:28.299 --> 02:26:31.760]  And, I mean, that's what type of scum you're talking about.
[02:26:32.719 --> 02:26:39.020]  Like, they'd come in here and they're here for years, every day recording us trying to find something.
[02:26:43.770 --> 02:26:54.270]  And then they make up lies like there was a fish tank of a crew member and there was a goldfish in it and they weren't working hard so Jones grabbed the goldfish and ate it.
[02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:56.930]  There's never been a fish tank here.
[02:26:58.370 --> 02:26:59.969]  I've never eaten a raw fish.
[02:27:00.110 --> 02:27:01.489]  I mean, a live raw fish.
[02:27:01.590 --> 02:27:02.049]  I've eaten sushi.
[02:27:02.469 --> 02:27:03.489]  I love fish.
[02:27:04.170 --> 02:27:06.590]  I've got a saltwater tank I've had 12 years I absolutely love.
[02:27:06.610 --> 02:27:08.350]  I've got one fish that's still alive in there.
[02:27:08.569 --> 02:27:09.649]  I love the damn thing.
[02:27:11.260 --> 02:27:14.280]  But again, that's in Wolf of Wall Street.
[02:27:15.319 --> 02:27:17.819]  They just make stuff up.
[02:27:19.139 --> 02:27:21.139]  And that's the funny stuff.
[02:27:21.239 --> 02:27:25.620]  They have sued my mother and father for two years.
[02:27:26.079 --> 02:27:29.340]  High-powered Democrat Party law firms, the main Democratic Party ones.
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:38.059]  And my dad didn't have more than a million bucks in the bank in a house.
[02:27:40.809 --> 02:27:42.770]  And he spent all the money that came in at Dr.
[02:27:42.829 --> 02:27:47.690]  Jones Naturals while they sued him, and now he's a prideful person.
[02:27:47.790 --> 02:28:00.209]  Not prideful, but I noticed he was really stressed out last few months, so I finally went over there when they were out of town and dug through all his paperwork, and he's inches from being bankrupt and losing his house.
[02:28:01.579 --> 02:28:03.399]  And my parents are like, you just fight harder.
[02:28:03.620 --> 02:28:07.739]  And they don't tell me because they don't want to bother me with what these fucking people have done.
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:09.219]  I'm fucking sick of them.
[02:28:09.299 --> 02:28:11.059]  And I will get your goddamn asses.
[02:28:11.139 --> 02:28:12.719]  It's the last fucking thing I do.
[02:28:12.940 --> 02:28:13.479]  Excuse me.
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:15.260]  Excuse me for taking the Lord's name in vain.
[02:28:15.420 --> 02:28:16.520]  But I do want them damned to hell.
[02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:17.500]  I mean, I don't take it in vain.
[02:28:17.579 --> 02:28:17.920]  I mean it.
[02:28:18.739 --> 02:28:24.920]  So, but the thing is, is that, you know what you think?
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:25.500]  I'm pissed.
[02:28:25.659 --> 02:28:26.940]  Imagine the stuff they've done to Trump.
[02:28:29.459 --> 02:28:32.340]  But all I'm saying is they're going to do that to all of you.
[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:33.860]  They want to hurt everybody.
[02:28:33.860 --> 02:28:34.879]  They want to make you poor.
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:38.819]  It's their admitted policy to control you, to dictate the terms of your surrender.
[02:28:49.620 --> 02:28:57.000]  So, when I get up here and I tell you I need money, it ain't so I can...
[02:28:58.430 --> 02:28:59.870]  We're gold cufflinks.
[02:29:00.030 --> 02:29:01.829]  I don't give a rat's ass about crap like that.
[02:29:02.010 --> 02:29:09.510]  The money you give to us by buying product goes into fighting the new world order.
[02:29:13.309 --> 02:29:14.530]  95% of it.
[02:29:15.149 --> 02:29:19.989]  Yeah, I eat a nice steak occasionally, drive an okay car, got a decent house, got a little pool in the backyard.
[02:29:20.329 --> 02:29:22.049]  I would give all that up in a second.
[02:29:22.329 --> 02:29:23.010]  That's nothing.
[02:29:25.350 --> 02:29:28.129]  I need money to fight these people.
[02:29:31.030 --> 02:29:36.450]  And we try to make it easy for you by giving you great products that you're going to love and want again and again.
[02:29:36.549 --> 02:29:43.909]  They're all private-labeled, already certified, top brands, so I know it's the best you're going to get.
[02:29:46.370 --> 02:29:49.370]  And I'd have no money problems if I sold you crap supplements.
[02:29:50.579 --> 02:29:51.360]  And marked them up.
[02:29:51.700 --> 02:29:52.319]  Don't do it.
[02:29:52.540 --> 02:29:53.899]  Folks, I'm offered now.
[02:29:54.200 --> 02:30:02.479]  It's now up to $5 million a month I've been offered to have some of these top gold companies on that charge people 30-40% above what the gold and silver is worth.
[02:30:03.020 --> 02:30:04.360]  And I just won't do it.
[02:30:05.559 --> 02:30:07.319]  Because I wouldn't want somebody to treat me like that.
[02:30:07.440 --> 02:30:08.280]  I know you trust me.
[02:30:08.420 --> 02:30:09.120]  I would not do that.
[02:30:09.420 --> 02:30:12.600]  Kirk Elliott is the biggest silver broker.
[02:30:14.930 --> 02:30:19.469]  But they only charge 8% after the fees and all the crap and their marketing and their crew.
[02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:24.389]  You know, we get like 20% of 8%.
[02:30:24.389 --> 02:30:24.950]  Okay.
[02:30:26.350 --> 02:30:29.090]  You know, oh, $100,000 a month sounds a lot.
[02:30:29.290 --> 02:30:30.709]  That doesn't fight the enemy.
[02:30:31.370 --> 02:30:32.469]  But I get it.
[02:30:32.850 --> 02:30:38.569]  I'd rather get $100,000 a month Some months it's 150 because we get a little commission.
[02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:39.950]  That's been the highest it's been.
[02:30:40.590 --> 02:30:42.110]  But it's like the Ring of Mordor.
[02:30:42.250 --> 02:30:43.969]  I'm like, well, I can do a lot of good, actually.
[02:30:44.510 --> 02:30:48.549]  I mean, I don't get tempted by evil, but the way I get tempted is wanting to fight evil.
[02:30:48.670 --> 02:30:49.229]  But that's the thing.
[02:30:49.290 --> 02:30:50.670]  You put the ring on, it is pure evil.
[02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:52.829]  You become it, so you can't beat it by doing it.
[02:30:52.829 --> 02:30:55.229]  And all the time I'm just like, 5 million now.
[02:30:55.909 --> 02:30:57.790]  Well, you know, listeners will still get some gold.
[02:30:57.809 --> 02:30:58.069]  Yeah.
[02:30:58.549 --> 02:31:07.850]  No, I don't want my listeners calling up, you know, old ladies that trust me, and then the guy told, oh, it's collectible, it's really good, and then they pay 30-40% what it's worth.
[02:31:07.850 --> 02:31:12.209]  No, I want you to get it, get a great deal, because I need that mojo.
[02:31:12.209 --> 02:31:15.770]  I need to be a good person.
[02:31:18.170 --> 02:31:20.790]  But then I start thinking, man, my parents are going to lose their house.
[02:31:21.469 --> 02:31:23.190]  I mean, I was literally last night driving home.
[02:31:23.309 --> 02:31:26.870]  I was like, nope, never, never.
[02:31:27.010 --> 02:31:29.870]  But the point is, that's why they want us all poor.
[02:31:30.069 --> 02:31:34.290]  That's a microcosm so that we'll all cut corners and survive.
[02:31:34.389 --> 02:31:42.090]  See, if the people are successful and independent and are moral, they won't have to bow just to survive.
[02:31:42.370 --> 02:31:44.250]  They want to get us all in that position.
[02:31:45.690 --> 02:31:50.399]  And Trump is fighting that.
[02:31:50.520 --> 02:31:51.139]  I'm fighting that.
[02:31:51.200 --> 02:31:51.760]  You're fighting that.
[02:31:51.899 --> 02:31:55.879]  So, just make the decision today so I don't have to belabor this.
[02:31:56.040 --> 02:31:57.840]  We have millions and millions of people tuning in right now.
[02:31:57.860 --> 02:32:01.620]  I don't want to sit here and talk about our products and say, go get Patriot t-shirts, but they're all great.
[02:32:01.680 --> 02:32:02.239]  I mean, look at this hat.
[02:32:04.219 --> 02:32:05.780]  Half these designs are me.
[02:32:06.280 --> 02:32:07.459]  And it's not rocket science.
[02:32:07.719 --> 02:32:09.299]  I'm sitting there going, hey, we need a...
[02:32:10.909 --> 02:32:11.610]  Squirrel shirt.
[02:32:12.090 --> 02:32:13.229]  And they can turn it around quick.
[02:32:13.370 --> 02:32:15.049]  When you see them put it on the site, they've made it.
[02:32:15.129 --> 02:32:15.950]  They're producing it in Arkansas.
[02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:16.409]  It's ready.
[02:32:16.989 --> 02:32:26.389]  I said yesterday, no, two days ago, Sunday I called them in Arkansas and I said, I want a red hat this color.
[02:32:26.489 --> 02:32:28.930]  It's like this kind of lighter red with white.
[02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:30.209]  This is total redneck deluxe.
[02:32:30.370 --> 02:32:31.309]  This is trashy American.
[02:32:32.010 --> 02:32:33.170]  And I want this font.
[02:32:33.350 --> 02:32:36.030]  It was in the mail yesterday.
[02:32:36.090 --> 02:32:38.690]  It was on my desk this morning when I walked in here.
[02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:42.760]  This is a fun hat right here.
[02:32:44.159 --> 02:32:46.139]  It's all there at the Alice Jones store.
[02:32:47.659 --> 02:32:51.920]  And there's great supplements like Ultimate Seamoss.
[02:32:52.159 --> 02:32:57.020]  When I get up here and say Seamoss is, for years, the hottest superfood, it is.
[02:32:57.120 --> 02:32:57.579]  Look it up.
[02:32:57.739 --> 02:33:00.700]  And we've got the best from one of the top suppliers that's highest rated.
[02:33:00.899 --> 02:33:05.979]  It's just the way the vitamins and minerals and the iodine in it is naturally produced in the moss is just spectacular.
[02:33:09.079 --> 02:33:13.059]  Because so much of nutrients is how it's delivered, what it's bound to.
[02:33:13.239 --> 02:33:15.739]  If it's bound to something that gets into the cells, it's great.
[02:33:16.059 --> 02:33:17.799]  If it isn't, it bounces off.
[02:33:17.920 --> 02:33:18.680]  It doesn't get in.
[02:33:20.440 --> 02:33:23.399]  Get the ultimate CMOS. It does so much for your whole body.
[02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:24.680]  Libido, stamina, energy.
[02:33:25.500 --> 02:33:27.260]  I mean, I'm high as a kite on it right now.
[02:33:27.540 --> 02:33:30.520]  I'm on methylfolate, next level foundational energy, Dr.
[02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:31.159]  Jones Naturals.
[02:33:31.540 --> 02:33:34.440]  I'm on CMOS. I'm on iodine.
[02:33:37.899 --> 02:33:39.180]  I'm actually taking the supplements.
[02:33:39.340 --> 02:33:41.559]  I mean, I'm taking like 15 pills a day right now.
[02:33:42.159 --> 02:33:43.459]  Drinking gallons of water.
[02:33:43.620 --> 02:33:45.200]  I feel better when I was 18.
[02:33:45.819 --> 02:33:49.360]  And I used to always kind of take some here and there, but I was kind of caught in this thing.
[02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:50.500]  No, I went all in.
[02:33:50.860 --> 02:33:52.079]  And then all in on everything.
[02:33:52.159 --> 02:33:55.260]  I lost 34 pounds in 67 days.
[02:33:57.159 --> 02:33:58.719]  No drugs, no Ozempic.
[02:33:59.299 --> 02:34:00.159]  You want to take Ozempic?
[02:34:00.219 --> 02:34:00.379]  Fine.
[02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:03.559]  It's untested, and I don't trust it.
[02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:07.559]  But you don't get bigger muscles when you're on Ozimpy.
[02:34:07.739 --> 02:34:09.020]  I've lost weight and gotten bigger.
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:10.680]  Because I'm working my ass off.
[02:34:10.799 --> 02:34:11.780]  And I've got the genetics.
[02:34:12.579 --> 02:34:16.020]  But the point is that this is the war.
[02:34:16.260 --> 02:34:17.600]  It's happening right now.
[02:34:17.799 --> 02:34:21.500]  If you'd have bought silver 13 months ago when I got elegant on.
[02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:24.700]  Because I believe it was the time.
[02:34:24.700 --> 02:34:25.700]  I knew it was going up.
[02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:27.840]  And so I go, well, I just buy to find the highest rate.
[02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:28.879]  And I go, I know this guy forever.
[02:34:29.020 --> 02:34:29.659]  Yeah, World Net Daily.
[02:34:29.780 --> 02:34:30.239]  Focus on the family.
[02:34:31.500 --> 02:34:34.799]  And then you'd be up almost, it's like 49% now a day up.
[02:34:35.700 --> 02:34:37.899]  From a year ago, I mean, oh my God, I told you to get silver.
[02:34:38.059 --> 02:34:39.399]  Sorry, it's only up 49%.
[02:34:39.399 --> 02:34:43.340]  No investment comes near that.
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:47.479]  So, I mean, look at our investment with Trump and fight the new old order.
[02:34:47.540 --> 02:34:50.040]  My God, we're just wrecking the living horse shit out of him.
[02:34:51.399 --> 02:34:52.899]  And all glory goes to God.
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:35:01.870]  But I'm telling you right now, That a fraction of the audience buys silver.
[02:35:02.430 --> 02:35:04.309]  I bet it's one-tenth of one percent.
[02:35:04.709 --> 02:35:11.950]  If five percent of you bought it, we'd have five million dollar commissions and you'd all have a great investment and I'd just plug it one time a day and we'd be done.
[02:35:12.809 --> 02:35:26.760]  But instead, I'd be just scrabbling, scrabbling to just get it, you know, I mean, you have no idea how much satellite uplink equipment and all this crap costs in the servers, and we just can't sit here and hope Infowars gets saved next week.
[02:35:26.860 --> 02:35:38.020]  We've had to do the whole frickin' thing, and I'm sitting there looking at the bank accounts, and there's just like almost no money, and then my dad's in trouble, and I want to go help him, and I'm just like...
[02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:39.680]  I mean, have I not proven?
[02:35:39.819 --> 02:35:41.299]  Have I not been a faithful servant to you?
[02:35:41.379 --> 02:35:42.280]  Well, please help me.
[02:35:42.420 --> 02:35:55.620]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, and I want to do it charging in, focused purely on news and information, not spending five minutes an hour with my hat in my hand to the 99% of you that never buy a damn thing.
[02:35:55.879 --> 02:35:56.020]  What?
[02:35:56.159 --> 02:36:01.840]  I mean, you're betting on yourself when you share the articles, when you pray for us, when you buy the damn products.
[02:36:01.979 --> 02:36:02.579]  I mean, it's...
[02:36:03.989 --> 02:36:05.770]  I told you, go get the silver.
[02:36:05.969 --> 02:36:07.090]  It's up almost 50.
[02:36:07.430 --> 02:36:08.370]  I told you, get the gold.
[02:36:08.530 --> 02:36:09.649]  It's up like 30-something.
[02:36:15.329 --> 02:36:22.209]  I'm telling you, take CMOS. Nitric Moose was a sleeper product.
[02:36:22.370 --> 02:36:23.250]  We barely promoted it.
[02:36:23.309 --> 02:36:29.510]  Now it's a super seller because particularly men are like, well, I didn't buy this knowing it was Viagra.
[02:36:31.049 --> 02:36:32.290]  But it does it healthily and naturally.
[02:36:32.430 --> 02:36:33.329]  That's just a side effect.
[02:36:33.690 --> 02:36:36.329]  I mean, we don't sell bull here.
[02:36:38.409 --> 02:36:39.389]  It's all tested.
[02:36:39.530 --> 02:36:40.010]  It's all everything.
[02:36:40.129 --> 02:36:40.829]  So I'm done talking.
[02:36:40.969 --> 02:36:44.290]  I want to get to your calls, the news, special guests coming up, so much more.
[02:36:45.649 --> 02:36:47.590]  Oh, and one more thing I forgot to tell you.
[02:36:48.049 --> 02:36:51.190]  This was Chase Geyser's idea like a year ago.
[02:36:52.329 --> 02:36:53.649]  And it took him this long.
[02:36:53.770 --> 02:36:55.049]  He did a great job to collate it all.
[02:36:55.229 --> 02:36:59.989]  He found, because he's obsessed with the old shows, he listens to them every day at night when he goes home.
[02:37:02.060 --> 02:37:03.959]  And he finds all these little jewels.
[02:37:04.479 --> 02:37:08.219]  There was no archive from 2001 to 2008 of the show.
[02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:14.280]  Because YouTube didn't come around until even a few years later, but none of this was available.
[02:37:15.959 --> 02:37:20.040]  Chase found an archive of 2001 to 2008 over a year ago.
[02:37:20.959 --> 02:37:25.000]  He digitized it, all of it, and it's a great fundraiser.
[02:37:25.079 --> 02:37:35.750]  So if you go to thealexjonesstore.com, If you go there, listen to this.
[02:37:36.809 --> 02:37:46.049]  MP3 audio files of all the Alex Jones Show episodes, the lost Alex Jones tapes, 2001, you'll hear Rogan calling on 9-11, to 2008.

[02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:09.100]  It's ultra green.
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:09.899]  It's not just evergreen.
[02:38:10.500 --> 02:38:20.860]  Our content has always been free, but now, for the first time ever, we have compiled the lost broadcast in one easy-to-use place that will ensure Alex Jones will be on the air for years to come.
[02:38:21.399 --> 02:38:23.420]  Go now to thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:38:23.420 --> 02:38:24.340]  There's a big link at the top.

[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:35.139]  So we're going to spend stuff there.
[02:38:35.180 --> 02:38:35.780]  It's a moneymaker.
[02:38:36.569 --> 02:38:38.010]  And if you're a member, you just get it free.
[02:38:38.790 --> 02:38:40.809]  But for other folks, you can go buy it and support us.
[02:38:41.090 --> 02:38:43.250]  Take action now, thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:38:43.350 --> 02:38:44.049]  Okay, I'm done plugging.
[02:38:44.950 --> 02:38:49.530]  I want to give the number out, take calls, go through all the breaking news, and there's been an attempted attack reported late at the Capitol.
[02:38:49.709 --> 02:38:50.610]  Of course, you know this is all coming.
[02:38:51.389 --> 02:38:52.370]  So easy to predict.
[02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:55.149]  You don't want me to play all the clips I've been saying the last few months.
[02:38:55.170 --> 02:38:55.790]  You know it.
[02:38:55.829 --> 02:38:56.670]  You know it's coming, too.
[02:38:57.350 --> 02:39:00.250]  But I guess Chase threw together a video to do with this, too, I didn't know about.
[02:39:00.329 --> 02:39:01.209]  So let's go ahead and roll that.
[02:39:30.250 --> 02:39:32.469]  The Alex Jones fan put that video together.
[02:39:32.590 --> 02:39:35.690]  Not the one he just put together with it, but I saw that.
[02:39:35.790 --> 02:39:36.870]  I retweeted it, but let me just give him advice.
[02:39:36.989 --> 02:39:41.350]  They do great jobs over at the Alex Jones fan on X. The music's too loud.
[02:39:42.250 --> 02:39:42.729]  Remix it.
[02:39:42.850 --> 02:39:43.069]  Send it.
[02:39:43.149 --> 02:39:43.629]  Post it again.
[02:39:43.750 --> 02:39:44.610]  I'll post it everywhere.
[02:39:44.870 --> 02:39:46.969]  You mix the music too loud.
[02:39:47.790 --> 02:39:48.110]  Please.
[02:39:49.049 --> 02:39:50.750]  I'm like directing people here on air.
[02:39:50.909 --> 02:39:51.649]  I love the fans.
[02:39:51.649 --> 02:39:52.430]  They do the best job.
[02:39:53.049 --> 02:39:54.190]  But that music's too loud.
[02:39:54.329 --> 02:39:56.229]  And the Alex Jones fan does better edits than I would do most of the time.
[02:39:56.290 --> 02:39:57.530]  I don't know why the music's too loud.
[02:39:57.969 --> 02:39:59.989]  Our feed was a little low that night.
[02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:01.389]  A little tinny.
[02:40:01.469 --> 02:40:03.350]  It was a test show over at the Alex Jones Network down the street.
[02:40:04.020 --> 02:40:05.579]  And so, that's where that...
[02:40:05.579 --> 02:40:06.600]  Oh, and you think you shut that down?
[02:40:06.659 --> 02:40:07.120]  That's good enough?
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:10.219]  Oh, I'm afraid there's another backup as well.
[02:40:11.780 --> 02:40:14.040]  So, as long...
[02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:20.120]  I'm afraid this battle station will be quite operational when your friends arrive.
[02:40:22.699 --> 02:40:24.020]  Sorry, I've been through a lot.
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:24.719]  You've been through a lot.
[02:40:25.340 --> 02:40:26.959]  I'm reveling right now.
[02:40:28.299 --> 02:40:29.120]  Savoring a little bit.
[02:40:29.579 --> 02:40:32.020]  Because even if they steal it tonight, you can feel it.
[02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:34.959]  Humanity is just waking up.
[02:40:35.079 --> 02:40:36.760]  And this is the best feeling in the world, isn't it?
[02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:40.940]  I mean, it is just amazing.
[02:40:41.899 --> 02:40:43.020]  It's going to get rough, though.
[02:40:44.700 --> 02:40:46.000]  But at least they know.
[02:40:46.600 --> 02:40:48.520]  And at the end of the day, all our enemies know.
[02:40:49.159 --> 02:40:50.299]  They started the fight.
[02:40:51.500 --> 02:40:53.100]  And they got one back, didn't they?
[02:40:53.879 --> 02:40:54.500]  All right.
[02:40:54.940 --> 02:40:58.719]  We have a guest popping in at the bottom of the hour from Pennsylvania with big breaking news there, exclusive.
[02:40:59.319 --> 02:41:05.620]  But I want to give the number out for listeners on the election, on what you're thinking is happening, what you're seeing in your area.
[02:41:06.059 --> 02:41:10.819]  Election calls, toll-free number, 877-789-2539.
[02:41:11.799 --> 02:41:14.879]  877-789-2539.
[02:41:15.579 --> 02:41:23.520]  877-789-ALEKS. And I really look forward to talking to you coming up in the next hour.
[02:41:23.780 --> 02:41:34.100]  And then, 65 minutes from now, Owen Schroyer and the War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:41.440]  And boy, Owen has dialed in all the voting system databases and all the feeds, and he's going to be kicking ass tonight.
[02:41:42.809 --> 02:41:49.069]  As the election numbers come in, and I'm in here in the studio with all these guests and things, we're going to be every five to ten minutes.
[02:41:49.149 --> 02:41:50.190]  In fact, he'll have a live feed.
[02:41:50.290 --> 02:41:54.069]  Anytime he tells us, whoa, sorry, we can have Steve Bannon on or anybody.
[02:41:54.370 --> 02:41:55.870]  Oh, hold on, we've got some breaking news.
[02:41:56.170 --> 02:41:59.250]  He will come in and give us the latest numbers and things.
[02:41:59.270 --> 02:42:00.809]  You're going to get it all right here.
[02:42:02.190 --> 02:42:06.569]  And that's why they really don't want you to take the live links from Infowars.com.
[02:42:07.670 --> 02:42:15.350]  And they really don't want you to take the feeds from Real Lock Showns on X and say, hey, here's the most censored show in the world.
[02:42:15.549 --> 02:42:19.510]  You know, the media operation that blew it wide open and what they're saying.
[02:42:19.510 --> 02:42:20.549]  And if you want to get...
[02:42:21.010 --> 02:42:25.489]  Probably the best analysis over the horizon of what's happening and what the bad guys are planning next.
[02:42:25.670 --> 02:42:27.350]  They really don't want you to listen to this.
[02:42:27.450 --> 02:42:30.389]  You know, Fauci doesn't want you to share this live coverage.
[02:42:30.629 --> 02:42:32.770]  Oh my gosh, Bill Gates doesn't want you to share it.
[02:42:32.909 --> 02:42:34.930]  Kamala sure hopes you don't share this.
[02:42:35.290 --> 02:42:45.170]  But we should put some posts out on Real Alex Jones, InfoWars, and Alex Jones Network and all the rest of the feeds and say, whatever you do, don't share this live unfiltered feed of what's really happening with the election.
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.120]  And again, they're trying to steal it.
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:51.200]  So why did we break their back pointing it out?
[02:42:51.739 --> 02:42:54.479]  So it's so obvious that they have to back off.
[02:42:55.020 --> 02:42:59.600]  But if you act like they're not doing it and people aren't watching, then they're going to do it.
[02:43:00.379 --> 02:43:04.920]  Again, you don't deny they're trying to steal it when they are because that could scare people.
[02:43:05.139 --> 02:43:06.040]  You go with the truth.
[02:43:06.239 --> 02:43:07.079]  That's leadership.
[02:43:14.370 --> 02:43:20.590]  Oh, they have been really using me as a punching bag in YouTube, but I gotta tell you, there's a lot more us that are awake now than them.
[02:43:21.309 --> 02:43:23.430]  Now they got Elon Musk to deal with.
[02:43:23.610 --> 02:43:25.329]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah!
[02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:29.120]  We are announcing Ultimate Hydroforce.
[02:43:29.559 --> 02:43:32.819]  Now, this is not just electrolytes, okay?
[02:43:33.219 --> 02:43:41.079]  This is really a superfood, similar to Vitamin Mineral Fusion, but with a whole bunch more electrolytes and other things in there.
[02:43:41.180 --> 02:43:46.559]  It would take me a long time to go through the ingredients, three pages of them here, and what they do.
[02:43:46.780 --> 02:44:02.489]  But it's got super high-quality Vitamin C, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, It's got panthenogenic acid, vitamin B5, so key, calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, chloride, sodium,
[02:44:03.090 --> 02:44:03.950]  and more.
[02:44:04.270 --> 02:44:05.850]  Potassium, the list goes on and on.
[02:44:06.049 --> 02:44:11.750]  And it's all the highest quality sources of it on top of that.
[02:44:11.750 --> 02:44:17.280]  And then it funds my broadcast, And the crew and all of us continuing on.
[02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:20.739]  So we need your support if Infowars shuts down November 13th to continue on.
[02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:25.000]  Regardless, it's going to help us up our game if Infowars survives.
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:33.700]  So please, go check out this amazing supplement, the highest quality you're going to find, with big discounts and other great supplements at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:46.139]  We sought out The very best, highest quality, rehydrating product for pre-workout, post-workout, you name it.
[02:44:46.340 --> 02:44:50.420]  And we found a top company with top reviews that would let us private label it.
[02:44:50.540 --> 02:44:53.079]  And it's beyond just hydration.
[02:44:53.340 --> 02:44:55.879]  It's beyond just getting your electrolytes.
[02:44:56.159 --> 02:44:57.540]  It's a super food.
[02:44:57.620 --> 02:44:58.420]  It's a pre-workout.
[02:44:58.479 --> 02:44:59.399]  It's a post-workout.
[02:44:59.540 --> 02:45:03.180]  You've got to go read all the ingredients that are in this bad boy.
[02:45:03.780 --> 02:45:13.139]  And then look at the insane low prices between 30 and 50% off depending on how many canisters you get of Ultimate Hydro Force.
[02:45:13.399 --> 02:45:19.979]  Now again, go look at the ingredients for yourself and the quality of the ingredients and the amount of the ingredients.
[02:45:20.219 --> 02:45:22.319]  This baby is next level.
[02:45:22.500 --> 02:45:28.299]  This is beyond anything out there at anywhere near this low price.
[02:45:28.930 --> 02:45:39.370]  As you know, I always seek to bring you the very best supplements possible so you get a great response, great effects, and you want to come back and get them again.
[02:45:39.370 --> 02:45:41.870]  Like a restaurant wants to have tasty, good, delicious food.
[02:45:41.989 --> 02:45:43.309]  So there's a line out the door.
[02:45:43.670 --> 02:45:51.809]  Well, I've got to admit some false advertising, and next time we reproduce this, or my sponsors do, we're going to probably have to change the name.
[02:45:52.149 --> 02:45:53.389]  And why is that?
[02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:54.090]  Well, it's simple.
[02:45:54.190 --> 02:45:58.069]  This is called Ultimate HydroForce Electrolyte Drink Mix.
[02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:02.280]  But it's really a superfood, post-workout, pre-workout.
[02:46:02.459 --> 02:46:06.120]  That's why it's Ultimate HydroForce and more, I guess you say.
[02:46:07.139 --> 02:46:12.739]  Hydration, energy, vitamins, minerals, health, immune system.
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:16.079]  Get your HydroForce exclusively at TheAlexYoungStore.com.
[02:46:26.299 --> 02:46:34.840]  If you're a Christian and you watch Hollywood movies or you watch football games or you're in the system and then you don't vote because Trump isn't perfect, you're a hypocrite.
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:36.100]  And that's the bottom line.
[02:46:36.930 --> 02:46:48.829]  But a lot of it is also Christians wanting to stay out of the fray, wanting to go to churches where everything's okay, we're just waiting for the return of Jesus, and we're not politically engaged, and we're not involved.
[02:46:49.090 --> 02:46:56.389]  So the way I would put it is, a vote for Trump is a vote for survival and having a shot at a livable future.
[02:46:56.850 --> 02:46:59.450]  And a vote for Kamala is a vote for the devil.
[02:47:00.030 --> 02:47:02.350]  And it really does just come down to that.
[02:47:02.569 --> 02:47:18.489]  And I've got to tell my Christian brethren out there that if you in your heart and your spirit don't understand that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are pure evil, and you just step aside and do nothing because you're like a Pharisee in Christ time.
[02:47:18.750 --> 02:47:19.569]  Look, read the New Testament.
[02:47:19.750 --> 02:47:27.190]  He constantly, Christ and his disciples criticized the Pharisees because they demanded everybody be absolutely perfect, but they themselves weren't.
[02:47:27.629 --> 02:47:28.370]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:47:28.489 --> 02:47:31.290]  Study says 32 million Christians likely not to vote.
[02:47:31.790 --> 02:47:35.290]  So I guess you're upset that Trump struck down Roe v.
[02:47:35.389 --> 02:47:36.469]  Wade or got that done.
[02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:41.280]  I guess you want the human trafficking to continue that he basically shut down 99%.
[02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:46.020]  I guess you want World War III. I mean, I guess you want the transgenderism in the schools.
[02:47:46.020 --> 02:47:49.219]  I guess you want the Venezuelan gangs running around and robbing and killing.
[02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:57.879]  I just cannot in my mind and my soul get my little brain wrapped around while you're sitting there on the sideline.
[02:48:22.010 --> 02:48:23.629]  The circle is now complete.
[02:48:24.090 --> 02:48:25.969]  It is game time.
[02:48:27.569 --> 02:48:28.569]  Election day.
[02:48:29.030 --> 02:48:30.450]  Doomsday for the globalists.
[02:48:30.569 --> 02:48:32.069]  November 5th, 2024.
[02:48:33.489 --> 02:48:38.110]  But don't think for a minute they might not set off a nuke and claim the Russians did it.
[02:48:38.389 --> 02:48:47.010]  Don't think for a minute there might not be a mass shooting tonight or tomorrow or next week of black Americans by a Trump-supporting white supremacist.
[02:48:48.389 --> 02:48:51.770]  And now, we're beginning to see the signs.
[02:48:53.729 --> 02:48:56.030]  But, this too will fail.
[02:48:56.149 --> 02:48:57.010]  No one's going to buy it.
[02:48:57.950 --> 02:49:05.770]  Breaking U.S. Capitol Visitor Center shuts down after a man smelling of fuel walks in carrying a torch and flare gun.
[02:49:07.030 --> 02:49:09.569]  Cal police arrest a man in possession of torch and flare gun.
[02:49:09.690 --> 02:49:10.530]  Was he going to self-immolate?
[02:49:12.209 --> 02:49:15.549]  A man who smelled like fuel with torch and flare gun arrested in U.S. Capitol.
[02:49:17.939 --> 02:49:20.219]  Russia-linked bomb threats to U.S. polling stations.
[02:49:20.379 --> 02:49:26.139]  Not credible, says the FBI, but the neocon that helps steal the elections in Michigan says it's happening.
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:31.540]  We'll play a clip of Rafshenberger here in a moment.
[02:49:32.700 --> 02:49:42.760]  And then, of course, we've got the white supremacist handled and run by the FBI. They built in the bomb, controlled him, were his leaders.
[02:49:42.940 --> 02:49:45.079]  They admit there were arrest documents in their press release.
[02:49:47.940 --> 02:49:49.659]  By the way, you guys always do a great job.
[02:49:49.659 --> 02:49:51.379]  You gave me the press release last night.
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:53.700]  I covered the emergency report from the Alex Jones Network.
[02:49:53.959 --> 02:49:56.299]  I've been asking for that since 30 months for the show.
[02:49:56.399 --> 02:49:56.979]  Did we ever find that?
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:50:00.299]  There was a press release by the Justice Department where they admit it all.
[02:50:01.579 --> 02:50:02.940]  And I covered it on air.
[02:50:04.299 --> 02:50:12.059]  Just type in Justice Department or FBI press release on man arrested attempting to blow up Tennessee power station tonight.
[02:50:12.850 --> 02:50:13.590]  Yeah, print me that.
[02:50:13.950 --> 02:50:14.870]  Print me that, please.
[02:50:15.270 --> 02:50:16.430]  Because I want to show people.
[02:50:16.549 --> 02:50:17.049]  I'm not just...
[02:50:17.049 --> 02:50:20.110]  I'm not like the corporate media that says, you know, things that aren't true.
[02:50:20.190 --> 02:50:23.930]  Like, Jones ate a goldfish in front of everybody and killed the employee's fish.
[02:50:24.010 --> 02:50:24.670]  No, it's not true.
[02:50:24.770 --> 02:50:25.129]  No, it is.
[02:50:25.250 --> 02:50:25.590]  It's all right.
[02:50:26.569 --> 02:50:28.649]  But, you see, with them, they're...
[02:50:28.649 --> 02:50:29.809]  I don't just tell you something.
[02:50:29.870 --> 02:50:37.229]  I want to show you in that press release and in the arrest documents, they admit they cooked it all up, which is the standard MO. So...
[02:50:43.860 --> 02:50:47.940]  Were another group planning to let them do it, and then the feds got smart and stopped these attacks?
[02:50:48.700 --> 02:50:52.260]  Or is this so they can say, oh, look, we stopped some of them, but we couldn't stop them all?
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:57.100]  Because, I mean, they've been telling you, oh, the white supremacist Trump supporters are going to blow up the power stations, boom.
[02:50:57.600 --> 02:51:00.620]  Or do they just say it enough and looms go, yeah, that's a good idea.
[02:51:00.799 --> 02:51:02.280]  I mean, either way, they're putting it out there.
[02:51:02.659 --> 02:51:07.000]  All right, we are now into our number four of my coverage.
[02:51:08.399 --> 02:51:09.780]  We've been here since 8 a.m.
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:14.920]  covering things in 54 minutes when Schroyer takes over for three hours.
[02:51:15.059 --> 02:51:16.799]  He's in all the technicals and numbers.
[02:51:17.739 --> 02:51:28.659]  And then he's going to continue on with me and a bunch of other special guests and your calls and X spaces and everything right through into the early morning hours of November 6th.
[02:51:28.940 --> 02:51:31.260]  But it is November 5th right now.
[02:51:35.029 --> 02:51:44.729]  And we've got a special guest, Cliff Maloney, joining us with one of the election integrity groups, PHA.com, at the bottom of the hour.
[02:51:44.809 --> 02:51:46.329]  But we're going to continue on with your phone calls.
[02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:49.309]  We're going to take a lot of phone calls throughout the night and tomorrow.
[02:51:50.329 --> 02:51:55.049]  If Trump doesn't clearly take it tonight, they're going to try to, you know, obviously steal it, but everything they're doing is blowing up their face.
[02:51:55.170 --> 02:51:56.729]  So I just, the dog ain't hunting.
[02:51:57.909 --> 02:51:59.389]  The gaslighting isn't working.
[02:52:01.729 --> 02:52:02.329]  And so...
[02:52:05.239 --> 02:52:11.100]  We're seeing signs they're going to just back off and let Trump win and then reconstitute and attack with a bunch of other garbage.
[02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:12.239]  But we'll see.
[02:52:14.899 --> 02:52:18.139]  Let's take your phone calls on the election, what you're seeing, what you think.
[02:52:18.559 --> 02:52:21.540]  Mike in New Orleans, Louisiana, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:52:22.799 --> 02:52:24.879]  It is so great to be here, Alex.
[02:52:25.719 --> 02:52:27.760]  Former United States Navy Blue Angel.
[02:52:28.250 --> 02:52:32.190]  I got out of the military due to saying that I was not going to take the COVID shot.
[02:52:32.350 --> 02:52:33.989]  The only person in my unit to say so.
[02:52:34.229 --> 02:52:35.229]  They kicked me out.
[02:52:35.389 --> 02:52:37.430]  Then they offered me $20,000 to come back in.
[02:52:37.530 --> 02:52:37.969]  I said no.
[02:52:38.229 --> 02:52:41.850]  God has protected me so much, just like he's protected President Trump.
[02:52:42.010 --> 02:52:49.090]  And I want you and everyone else to remember that President Trump was not saved on July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania for no reason.
[02:52:49.770 --> 02:52:53.389]  Jesus Christ, God, our Heavenly Father, has great plans for this country.
[02:52:53.389 --> 02:52:54.129]  It's not over.
[02:52:54.510 --> 02:52:56.729]  And I want everyone to know that Trump is going to win.
[02:52:56.909 --> 02:53:01.190]  I'm predicting and prophesying that President Trump will win, and we will have more troubles.
[02:53:01.350 --> 02:53:02.209]  It's not going to be perfect.
[02:53:02.250 --> 02:53:03.430]  It's not the end of the road.
[02:53:03.649 --> 02:53:11.209]  But we, and men like you, President Trump, the guest you had earlier, Gavin McGinnis and others, they have worked very hard.
[02:53:11.250 --> 02:53:14.350]  You guys have worked very hard for this country, and people are finally waking up.
[02:53:14.489 --> 02:53:24.430]  When I first started watching you back in 2013, I questioned certain things, and then I came to realize, wait, These guys are really saying things that we're not all hearing.
[02:53:24.649 --> 02:53:26.350]  Why are they not teaching this stuff in schools?
[02:53:26.510 --> 02:53:28.569]  Why are they not teaching the U.S. Constitution in the military?
[02:53:28.850 --> 02:53:41.329]  Why, when I wanted to teach the U.S. Constitution in the military, I was always given excuses why you cannot teach it, even though, by law, you have to teach it every September 17th throughout all federal agencies, branches of government, and schools.
[02:53:41.610 --> 02:53:49.670]  So I just want everyone to know that You know, it's been very stressful for both Democrats and Republicans, but we're all Americans, and we all do come together for the same values.
[02:53:49.889 --> 02:53:50.489]  It's not diversity.
[02:53:50.489 --> 02:53:51.889]  It's not multiculturalism.
[02:53:51.989 --> 02:53:55.569]  It's our founding motto, E Pluribus Unum, which means we are all different.
[02:53:55.729 --> 02:54:02.389]  We all come from different places, and we all have different backgrounds, but we come together, E Pluribus Unum, out of many, one.
[02:54:02.590 --> 02:54:04.690]  We come together for the same values.
[02:54:04.969 --> 02:54:07.569]  The same God-given values that we know in our heart are true.
[02:54:07.989 --> 02:54:11.290]  Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, and private property.
[02:54:11.409 --> 02:54:12.389]  We all love those things.
[02:54:12.649 --> 02:54:13.870]  That's what makes us American.
[02:54:14.389 --> 02:54:16.370]  And I'm so glad to be here.
[02:54:16.450 --> 02:54:20.889]  I'm so glad to have said to God, hey, I want you to be with me.
[02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:22.209]  I don't know what to do.
[02:54:22.209 --> 02:54:28.129]  I don't know what I'm going to do for work to provide food for my family because I do not want to put this poison in my blood.
[02:54:28.510 --> 02:54:29.750]  And I had no plan.
[02:54:30.059 --> 02:54:33.280]  And after I got out, I ended up making more money and doing better.
[02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:38.479]  Not because of me or because of how hard I worked, but because God is miraculous in how He works.
[02:54:38.540 --> 02:54:39.719]  He works very mysteriously.
[02:54:39.920 --> 02:54:42.100]  And I want people to don't give up on God.
[02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:43.059]  Don't give up on yourself.
[02:54:43.540 --> 02:54:44.719]  Don't give up on your family.
[02:54:44.840 --> 02:54:45.860]  And don't give up on this country.
[02:54:46.020 --> 02:54:49.420]  There's good things that we have ahead of us.
[02:54:49.559 --> 02:54:57.129]  And if you just pray every day, and if you don't know what you're going to do, Pray to God and say, look, I'm not strong enough.
[02:54:57.129 --> 02:54:58.930]  I can't do this on my own, but you are.
[02:54:59.110 --> 02:55:00.729]  You can give me the strength, God.
[02:55:00.930 --> 02:55:04.510]  And this is so important because God is real.
[02:55:04.510 --> 02:55:08.610]  And if you just ask him to come into your life, he will come into your life.
[02:55:08.610 --> 02:55:11.309]  He will fix anything that you ask him to fix.
[02:55:11.549 --> 02:55:14.030]  So President Trump will win.
[02:55:14.170 --> 02:55:18.610]  We have tough times ahead, but we've gone through the toughest times in my opinion.
[02:55:18.750 --> 02:55:22.430]  And I think that we have glorious beginnings that are going to happen.
[02:55:22.659 --> 02:55:28.120]  When we hear these great stories about the golden age of America and what do we want to be great again?
[02:55:28.340 --> 02:55:30.159]  We want families to be great again.
[02:55:30.239 --> 02:55:31.340]  We want God in our schools.
[02:55:31.579 --> 02:55:37.319]  We want the Second Amendment to be protected where people don't get looked at weirdly for carrying their weapons.
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:39.420]  We want all of these things.
[02:55:39.500 --> 02:55:41.180]  We want our kids to be protected.
[02:55:41.399 --> 02:55:45.440]  We don't want our schools to look like prisons and guards to be outside the doors.
[02:55:45.659 --> 02:55:49.760]  We want people to understand that we are all free.
[02:55:50.079 --> 02:55:51.559]  Individual freedom is real.
[02:55:51.950 --> 02:55:54.149]  It's very real, and it comes from God.
[02:55:54.309 --> 02:55:57.829]  The U.S. Constitution is God-guided.
[02:55:57.969 --> 02:56:01.389]  It was not just a bunch of white guys that were racist.
[02:56:01.510 --> 02:56:01.649]  No.
[02:56:01.870 --> 02:56:04.170]  This is providence.
[02:56:04.170 --> 02:56:08.290]  This is God working through humanity to provide a way for us to all be free.
[02:56:08.450 --> 02:56:17.549]  It's very important that we all remember that, because it can be lost, and we can dive down and become a terrible country like North Korea, Venezuela.
[02:56:18.270 --> 02:56:24.040]  You know, God takes Imperfect people and does incredible things with them like Moses who was afraid to speak.
[02:56:24.540 --> 02:56:30.700]  He took President Trump in perfect and made him into, in my opinion, the greatest leader in American history.
[02:56:31.399 --> 02:56:32.459]  Let me stop you there.
[02:56:32.540 --> 02:56:34.479]  You're making great points, but I got it to everybody else.
[02:56:34.620 --> 02:56:39.600]  But they purge the military with the poison shots on purpose and critical race theory and all that.
[02:56:40.180 --> 02:56:43.500]  Because they want to wreck it to bring in nothing but a robot military in the future.
[02:56:43.579 --> 02:56:44.760]  And that's the minute Pentagon plan.
[02:56:45.340 --> 02:56:48.120]  So hopefully you'll be able to get back in if you want to once Trump gets in.
[02:56:48.180 --> 02:56:48.940]  But God bless you, brother.
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:49.920]  We really appreciate your call.
[02:56:50.020 --> 02:56:50.879]  It was an amazing phone call.
[02:56:52.329 --> 02:56:53.569]  It says one of the blue angels.
[02:56:53.750 --> 02:56:57.049]  I've seen them a lot when I was a kid and seen them more recently.
[02:56:57.190 --> 02:56:57.610]  Just amazing.
[02:56:57.750 --> 02:56:58.690]  Some of the best pilots in the world.
[02:56:59.229 --> 02:56:59.549]  All right.
[02:56:59.670 --> 02:57:00.409]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[02:57:01.250 --> 02:57:03.489]  Jake in Ohio, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:57:03.690 --> 02:57:04.069]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:57:05.209 --> 02:57:06.049]  How you doing, man?
[02:57:06.190 --> 02:57:10.870]  Hey, first I want to thank you and Gerald for turning me on to God.
[02:57:11.370 --> 02:57:14.670]  I was 40 years old before I finally believed, but anyhow.
[02:57:15.100 --> 02:57:24.020]  I think what they're going to do is blow up one of them migrant centers in either Texas or Cali, and then, you know, of course, the Mexican government and the cartels will feign outrage and invade.
[02:57:27.379 --> 02:57:30.079]  I think that's definitely one of the things on the agenda, brother.
[02:57:31.159 --> 02:57:32.680]  Do me a favor, turn your radio off.
[02:57:33.559 --> 02:57:34.600]  Oh, that's you.
[02:57:34.780 --> 02:57:34.979]  Sorry.
[02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:36.440]  I know my voice.
[02:57:36.540 --> 02:57:37.059]  Yeah, I hear myself.
[02:57:38.299 --> 02:57:39.520]  One of these is enough.
[02:57:41.739 --> 02:57:43.600]  Man, you look just like my uncle, dude.
[02:57:43.879 --> 02:57:44.760]  You guys are, like, identical.
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:45.360]  It's crazy.
[02:57:46.079 --> 02:57:51.940]  And I also sent you guys a bunch of good ideas for t-shirts, man, like Hillary Clinton's vagina killed Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:57:53.819 --> 02:57:54.879]  That's a little racy.
[02:57:55.319 --> 02:57:55.959]  Yeah, I know.
[02:57:56.059 --> 02:57:56.340]  It's a bit.
[02:57:56.600 --> 02:57:59.860]  Or Queers for Palestine Airlines flying off a rooftop near you.
[02:58:01.799 --> 02:58:04.399]  I had to kill the t-shirt that came up with it.
[02:58:04.459 --> 02:58:05.420]  Alex Jones is his daddy.
[02:58:05.620 --> 02:58:07.840]  So, yeah, we're not trying to be too racy here, but I hear you, brother.
[02:58:08.040 --> 02:58:12.110]  Yeah, I No, no, but what do we do if they do stage a big false flag?
[02:58:12.170 --> 02:58:13.610]  It looks like they're warming them up right now.
[02:58:15.569 --> 02:58:17.389]  I'm beating my brains around about that.
[02:58:17.530 --> 02:58:21.510]  Like, it's just impossible to, you know, judge that.
[02:58:22.229 --> 02:58:23.170]  You know what I mean?
[02:58:23.229 --> 02:58:26.889]  Because, obviously, at that time, it's up in arms.
[02:58:27.049 --> 02:58:28.069]  I mean, it's grab your gun.
[02:58:28.329 --> 02:58:28.950]  You know what I mean?
[02:58:29.010 --> 02:58:31.110]  Like, just, you have to.
[02:58:32.450 --> 02:58:34.530]  You know, I'm not calling for anything like that.
[02:58:34.569 --> 02:58:36.069]  You understand with their propaganda.
[02:58:36.290 --> 02:58:37.409]  Okay, they blow up a migrant center.
[02:58:38.149 --> 02:58:39.549]  And then they blame Trump supporters.
[02:58:39.770 --> 02:58:41.290]  Who do we grab guns on who?
[02:58:41.569 --> 02:58:51.110]  I mean, you know, again, the gun is the info or if they blow up a migrant center, we expose they've been pre-programming and we didn't do it, just like the FBI was running this latest white supremacist.
[02:58:51.209 --> 02:58:55.159]  I mean, you know, I mean, I mean, again, Grab your guns who?
[02:58:55.840 --> 02:58:58.120]  Because seriously, I mean, what, the cops?
[02:58:58.239 --> 02:58:59.100]  Most of them are on our side.
[02:58:59.459 --> 02:59:01.760]  What, the FBI? Most of them are compartmentalized.
[02:59:02.340 --> 02:59:05.819]  And then, okay, you go out and you kill the FBI unit.
[02:59:05.819 --> 02:59:06.680]  I'm not saying do that.
[02:59:06.760 --> 02:59:08.100]  I'm saying hypothetically don't do that.
[02:59:08.500 --> 02:59:09.920]  That stages something.
[02:59:10.540 --> 02:59:14.000]  I mean, let's say the FBI just got caught staging the Whitmer kidnapping.
[02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:14.719]  It came out.
[02:59:14.799 --> 02:59:15.700]  They lost their jobs.
[02:59:15.920 --> 02:59:17.319]  They got in trouble.
[02:59:18.819 --> 02:59:20.559]  We won that because we didn't...
[02:59:20.559 --> 02:59:21.600]  I mean, if somebody went...
[02:59:22.379 --> 02:59:25.920]  And killed those FBI agents that would turn them into victims and make us the bad guys.
[02:59:26.139 --> 02:59:28.360]  So I'm not trying to be mean to you, sir, but just listen to me.
[02:59:29.159 --> 02:59:29.940]  Violence is not...
[02:59:29.940 --> 02:59:33.120]  Now, they're trying to take you to a FEMA camp, and the power is off.
[02:59:33.180 --> 02:59:35.260]  We're in martial law, and they're driving around in trucks, running people up.
[02:59:35.540 --> 02:59:36.399]  Yeah, we're in a war.
[02:59:37.140 --> 02:59:37.540]  Okay?
[02:59:38.120 --> 02:59:44.180]  But I'm just telling you that it's going to be the state attorney generals and the state police that there is martial law.
[02:59:44.299 --> 02:59:45.899]  You're going to have states break away, line up.
[02:59:46.219 --> 02:59:48.700]  The globalists will release a bioweapon that's killing so many people.
[02:59:48.780 --> 02:59:53.700]  You'll just be in your house, and so will I. So I appreciate your call, but man, I study this, folks.
[02:59:54.440 --> 02:59:56.959]  People just have this instinctive thing that it's fighting.
[02:59:57.100 --> 02:59:58.500]  You're in a new type of war.
[02:59:59.149 --> 03:00:01.190]  90 plus percent of it's information.
[03:00:01.510 --> 03:00:04.510]  And if you lose the information war, you lose the physical war.
[03:00:04.690 --> 03:00:10.469]  The reason we're winning is because we're doing it in information war and very Gandhi-esque.
[03:00:10.569 --> 03:00:13.270]  We let them attack us and do horrible stuff to us.
[03:00:13.309 --> 03:00:15.909]  We expose their false flags like Jan 6 and Governor Whitmer.
[03:00:16.670 --> 03:00:19.469]  And we were very cool like Fonzie.
[03:00:19.930 --> 03:00:21.430]  So that's what we need to do here.
[03:00:22.250 --> 03:00:22.770]  Alright?
[03:00:23.329 --> 03:00:25.850]  And I understand people are ready to start killing.
[03:00:26.409 --> 03:00:26.930]  But...
[03:00:29.610 --> 03:00:45.290]  I mean, do you think mowing down a group of Democrat protesters of Trump in a contested election, say in two weeks, which don't do, this is hypothetical.
[03:00:45.290 --> 03:00:46.610]  I'm saying this is the wrong thing to do.
[03:00:47.530 --> 03:00:52.690]  And let's say they burned stuff down and killed cops and horrible stuff, and then somebody from a parking garage shoots 100 of them.
[03:00:55.090 --> 03:00:57.090]  And then idiots go online and defend it.
[03:00:57.829 --> 03:00:59.709]  Right there, they've got what they want for a civil war.
[03:01:01.530 --> 03:01:09.049]  So, somebody goes to George Soros' house and puts him on a meat hook.
[03:01:10.190 --> 03:01:11.170]  Turns him into victims.
[03:01:11.329 --> 03:01:12.989]  Don't touch a hair on his head.
[03:01:14.090 --> 03:01:14.969]  Plus, he's a vegetable.
[03:01:15.709 --> 03:01:25.420]  But yeah, once we take the government back, we prosecute, move up the chain, give them a trial, make sure it's fair, and Then whatever the jury finds for treason.
[03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:27.760]  And it's a good example for people.
[03:01:27.920 --> 03:01:29.579]  And then they know that's what it's coming to.
[03:01:29.659 --> 03:01:30.780]  That's why they said they're going to do it to us.
[03:01:30.940 --> 03:01:32.120]  That was their plan for us.
[03:01:32.440 --> 03:01:35.239]  So when you've got people to do stuff like that, you've got to do your duty.
[03:01:35.440 --> 03:01:37.620]  But it's all got to be done legal and lawful like.
[03:01:40.540 --> 03:01:45.319]  And so that's what we're dealing with here.
[03:01:45.579 --> 03:01:46.860]  So this isn't a game.
[03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:51.180]  This isn't, you know, call of duty.
[03:01:52.280 --> 03:01:53.299]  This is the real world.
[03:01:54.620 --> 03:01:58.120]  So what we do here is violent with the truth.
[03:01:59.700 --> 03:02:02.559]  What we do is very vicious to the enemy.
[03:02:02.780 --> 03:02:05.219]  It hurts them irrevocably.
[03:02:07.100 --> 03:02:08.520]  And I'm going to go on hurting them.
[03:02:11.079 --> 03:02:15.420]  Because I told them, I don't know how this is all going to end for me, but in the end, you're going down.
[03:02:17.559 --> 03:02:18.500]  And they know that.
[03:02:21.389 --> 03:02:23.809]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Trace in New Jersey.
[03:02:23.989 --> 03:02:25.049]  Trace, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:02:26.530 --> 03:02:27.690]  Hey, how's it going, Uncle Alex?
[03:02:28.069 --> 03:02:31.290]  I've been listening to you since I was six years old.
[03:02:31.430 --> 03:02:38.850]  I first saw you on a local Fox affiliate for talking about abortion and the Klan.
[03:02:39.030 --> 03:02:43.350]  But what I really called in for, I have an election update from New Jersey.
[03:02:44.209 --> 03:02:46.590]  I went early voted on Sunday.
[03:02:47.940 --> 03:02:52.100]  And they have these new fancy machines that are totally touchscreen.
[03:02:52.559 --> 03:02:58.040]  You put your ballot into it, and it scans it, and then you go ahead and you vote.
[03:02:58.219 --> 03:03:00.040]  I didn't have any issues when I voted.
[03:03:01.920 --> 03:03:09.440]  So a friend of mine works in the school system, and they do a lot of the election in the school systems.
[03:03:09.620 --> 03:03:19.629]  And they are seeing a lot of people that don't speak English Yeah, no, I mean, it's on record.
[03:03:19.770 --> 03:03:28.909]  The illegal aliens are under the control of NGOs and local immigration lawyers, and they tell them, you go vote, and you bring back proof of it, or you don't get your welfare.
[03:03:29.190 --> 03:03:30.530]  I mean, they are, and they're scared.
[03:03:30.549 --> 03:03:31.370]  I don't even blame them.
[03:03:31.610 --> 03:03:33.209]  They're refugees from collapsed countries.
[03:03:33.409 --> 03:03:36.149]  Some of them are criminals that have been dumped in other prisons, but a lot of them are just refugees.
[03:03:36.870 --> 03:03:45.270]  They get here, they get signed up for work, they get signed up for welfare and multiple identities, most of the money gets taken off the top, and then they're told, you get over here and you go vote, or we're going to deport you.
[03:03:45.389 --> 03:03:48.250]  They make one phone call, and then they get picked up for deportation.
[03:03:48.819 --> 03:03:52.459]  But for everybody else, they set it out seven years to their first immigration hearing.
[03:03:52.760 --> 03:03:53.600]  Hey, you're in.
[03:03:54.020 --> 03:03:58.280]  Just give us a big slice of the money and keep your mouth shut.
[03:03:58.459 --> 03:04:06.899]  And then you'll see the illegals getting off the bus, all nervous, you know, in Georgia or in Pennsylvania or in Michigan or in Arizona.
[03:04:07.239 --> 03:04:09.899]  And they walk up and there'll be a bureaucrat there and they're waiting.
[03:04:10.020 --> 03:04:10.340]  Come on in.
[03:04:10.379 --> 03:04:10.719]  It's okay.
[03:04:10.799 --> 03:04:12.899]  And they'll go, well, that name doesn't match, but it's okay.
[03:04:12.940 --> 03:04:13.440]  You can still vote.
[03:04:13.520 --> 03:04:14.000]  Thank you.
[03:04:14.100 --> 03:04:14.680]  And they go in.
[03:04:15.149 --> 03:04:30.389]  And it's like, you know, they're told they're in this new country, and they're told, and then they go on Telemundo and tell them you're allowed to vote, and Obama says you're allowed to vote, and they see ads, you know, you can vote in our city, and they're like, and they'll even ask, it's not just the new James O'Keefe undercover, there's others he got in Texas, and other ones where they're like,
[03:04:30.850 --> 03:04:43.469]  well, they're saying, I don't, you know, in Spanish, they're like, I didn't know I could do this, but they tell me I must, so I go, and they, the lady from the government takes me, it's not a lady from the government, but the NGOs, when you go to the border, There's these giant camps.
[03:04:43.590 --> 03:04:44.250]  We shot video of it.
[03:04:44.430 --> 03:04:47.309]  Fall over with helicopters, you know, the size of five, six football fields.
[03:04:47.729 --> 03:05:01.950]  And the NGOs, literal blue and purple haired, like 25-year-old leftists, 30-year-old leftists, are ordering the National Guard, the State Guard, and the Border Patrol around and are their bosses facilitating the smuggling.
[03:05:02.090 --> 03:05:09.030]  I mean, the Border Patrol, the head of the union has been public all over the news for four years saying, we are now ordered to facilitate the smuggling.
[03:05:09.690 --> 03:05:09.989]  Okay?
[03:05:10.329 --> 03:05:14.170]  And you go there and literal NGOs are being saluted by the military.
[03:05:14.389 --> 03:05:15.149]  They are in command.
[03:05:15.430 --> 03:05:16.309]  Does that make sense?
[03:05:17.250 --> 03:05:17.870]  Oh, yeah.
[03:05:18.010 --> 03:05:20.549]  You know, Uncle Alex, I grew up there in Corpus Christi.
[03:05:21.129 --> 03:05:24.569]  I used to see illegals coming all the time.
[03:05:25.030 --> 03:05:29.770]  You know, I would take trips with friends down to Mexico and we'd see them.
[03:05:30.190 --> 03:05:33.030]  And large groups coming across the border.
[03:05:33.389 --> 03:05:37.030]  And people really don't think that it's as bad as it is.
[03:05:37.090 --> 03:05:37.909]  It's gotten worse.
[03:05:38.049 --> 03:05:38.930]  I know it's gotten worse.
[03:05:39.129 --> 03:05:46.430]  Having grown up in South Texas, I've had a couple of friends go missing or die because of the illegal immigrants.
[03:05:46.629 --> 03:05:48.270]  And it's getting ridiculous.
[03:05:48.590 --> 03:05:54.629]  And I live in New Jersey now, and I see so many Haitians, people from all over the world.
[03:05:54.790 --> 03:05:59.120]  I've seen these military-aged Chinese men And women coming through.
[03:05:59.360 --> 03:06:01.920]  And I'm like, oh, dear God, they're really going to push me very hard.
[03:06:01.920 --> 03:06:03.700]  Well, brother, it's not just your call, I believe you.
[03:06:04.040 --> 03:06:06.219]  There's videos out of New Jersey where the illegal aliens are voting.
[03:06:06.479 --> 03:06:07.159]  Look at this.
[03:06:08.110 --> 03:06:09.590]  I've got a stack of news on that.
[03:06:10.370 --> 03:06:13.049]  Cartels throwing dead bodies over California border wall.
[03:06:13.170 --> 03:06:14.110]  There's video of it, everything.
[03:06:14.530 --> 03:06:15.370]  Here's another one.
[03:06:15.469 --> 03:06:15.729]  Video.
[03:06:15.930 --> 03:06:22.049]  Gruesome axe attack on train where the illegal aliens just start attacking everybody with axes in Paris.
[03:06:22.850 --> 03:06:24.870]  Swear Allah or we'll do it again.
[03:06:25.190 --> 03:06:29.350]  12-year-old schoolgirl beaten and has her hair set on fire in Vienna gang attack.
[03:06:29.569 --> 03:06:31.549]  I mean, I have hundreds of these every day.
[03:06:32.350 --> 03:06:34.229]  Total cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
[03:06:34.920 --> 03:06:36.059]  And then we've got this news.
[03:06:36.139 --> 03:06:36.819]  I appreciate your call.
[03:06:37.200 --> 03:06:41.719]  This is Reuters, which means CIA. Don't be fooled by early U.S. vote counts.
[03:06:41.840 --> 03:06:42.719]  They might be misleading.
[03:06:43.079 --> 03:06:44.840]  Red Mirage crap again.
[03:06:45.040 --> 03:06:47.620]  Oh, even if it looks like Trump wins, we're not going to accept it.
[03:06:48.879 --> 03:06:52.479]  And it's probably not going to be decided tonight.
[03:06:53.549 --> 03:06:58.309]  You know, their selected chosen one probably won't be announced tonight, and the people's person won't be announced tonight.
[03:06:58.489 --> 03:06:58.690]  Probably.
[03:06:58.829 --> 03:06:59.469]  It could be so big.
[03:06:59.610 --> 03:07:01.409]  Roger thinks it's probably going to happen to Trump's Wednesday night.
[03:07:01.610 --> 03:07:02.250]  Hope he's right.
[03:07:02.569 --> 03:07:03.069]  We're really wrong.
[03:07:03.409 --> 03:07:07.549]  But they're already pulling the Red Mirage crap, but no one's going to buy this this time.
[03:07:08.569 --> 03:07:10.309]  Steve in New York, you're on the air.
[03:07:10.709 --> 03:07:11.170]  Thank you.
[03:07:12.870 --> 03:07:13.549]  Hey, Alex.
[03:07:13.670 --> 03:07:19.450]  I met you in Pennsylvania at Tucker's VIP event, and it was great meeting you, Chase Geiser, and Rob Dew.
[03:07:19.909 --> 03:07:26.950]  And I'm here to say that on Election Day, November 5th, 2024, is the day of transcendence by Jesus Christ.
[03:07:27.250 --> 03:07:41.709]  No matter what happens tonight, whether Trump is elected or not, whether this goes to January 6th, the 16th Civil War conditions, etc., it doesn't matter because we, the people, have finally rosen up out of this culture war and we are finally getting somewhere.
[03:07:41.930 --> 03:07:48.389]  There's a reason why millions of us tonight have woke up with a spark and an energy that I've never had in the last couple of years.
[03:07:48.670 --> 03:07:54.790]  And we are all on a positive note regardless of what happens because we won the culture war led by InfoWars.
[03:07:54.969 --> 03:07:59.229]  We got RFK and Tulsi Gabbard and Elon Musk and Joe Rogan.
[03:07:59.329 --> 03:08:03.030]  We definitely are going to win this regardless if they try and steal it.
[03:08:03.149 --> 03:08:04.709]  No one's going to believe it, Alex.
[03:08:04.930 --> 03:08:06.530]  We're going to win this thing!
[03:08:06.729 --> 03:08:07.170]  Yeah!
[03:08:08.870 --> 03:08:09.889]  Well, I agree with you.
[03:08:10.069 --> 03:08:12.649]  So elaborate on it's here.
[03:08:12.750 --> 03:08:13.909]  The Great Awakening's here.
[03:08:14.069 --> 03:08:15.530]  We're winning the culture war.
[03:08:15.750 --> 03:08:17.010]  We've broken the trance.
[03:08:17.129 --> 03:08:18.149]  We've broken the conditioning.
[03:08:18.409 --> 03:08:19.190]  You can feel it.
[03:08:19.250 --> 03:08:19.909]  You can see it.
[03:08:19.989 --> 03:08:23.069]  No matter what happens now, it's the beginning of the end of the New World Order.
[03:08:25.149 --> 03:08:28.709]  100%, the vaccination program that they rolled out did not work.
[03:08:28.809 --> 03:08:31.149]  We're now talking about fluoride in the water.
[03:08:31.290 --> 03:08:34.989]  We're talking about the vaccinations and having a healthier life for our children.
[03:08:35.600 --> 03:08:40.940]  We are now in a place where by Jesus Christ of Nazareth has given us transcendence.
[03:08:41.100 --> 03:08:43.420]  There is something so much greater ahead of us.
[03:08:43.709 --> 03:08:48.809]  Not sure when it's going to happen, not sure what's going to happen tonight, but we're going to win this thing.
[03:08:48.930 --> 03:08:52.270]  We won the culture war and it's all positivity from this point on.
[03:08:52.469 --> 03:08:57.709]  Well, we've definitely got the initiative and the tide's been turned and the awakening is accelerating.
[03:08:57.950 --> 03:09:00.110]  And it's not just we're talking about flora in the water.
[03:09:00.170 --> 03:09:05.569]  The government four months ago said, okay, it's deadly, gives you cancer, lowers fertility and attacks, you know, just your whole body.
[03:09:07.249 --> 03:09:13.569]  And then now Trump says he's gonna ban it, and he's gonna ban the vaccines once they release all the secret data.
[03:09:13.729 --> 03:09:15.010]  I mean, that's the last 48 hours.
[03:09:15.170 --> 03:09:16.610]  I mean, it is on, brother.
[03:09:18.389 --> 03:09:19.510]  Oh, I love it, man.
[03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:21.750]  There's no better place to be than in the fight.
[03:09:21.969 --> 03:09:23.969]  I went to that protest in Washington.
[03:09:24.430 --> 03:09:26.290]  Four years ago, nothing happened to me.
[03:09:26.370 --> 03:09:27.350]  I committed no crimes.
[03:09:27.450 --> 03:09:29.030]  And I was fired from my job.
[03:09:29.129 --> 03:09:30.850]  And they offered it back to me on their terms.
[03:09:30.989 --> 03:09:31.690]  And I said no.
[03:09:31.909 --> 03:09:36.329]  Just like your first caller who took a stance on the vaccinations, I took a stance.
[03:09:36.469 --> 03:09:38.930]  There is no price on free speech, Alex.
[03:09:39.110 --> 03:09:40.190]  And thanks for what you do.
[03:09:40.350 --> 03:09:44.270]  If it wasn't for you, the crew in this program, I'm not sure where this country would be.
[03:09:44.510 --> 03:09:46.450]  You have done well, Lord Vader.
[03:09:47.110 --> 03:09:47.709]  All right, brother.
[03:09:47.829 --> 03:09:48.350]  Thanks for calling.
[03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:53.139]  Oh my goodness.
[03:09:57.620 --> 03:10:00.000]  I'll do that little evil laugh because it freaks the left out.
[03:10:00.399 --> 03:10:01.799]  They really don't like me.
[03:10:04.180 --> 03:10:05.799]  Oh my goodness gracious.
[03:10:07.139 --> 03:10:10.100]  See, I've been pushing and pushing and pushing for this.
[03:10:10.700 --> 03:10:12.620]  And I know it's real.
[03:10:16.460 --> 03:10:17.479]  I mean, you understand.
[03:10:17.819 --> 03:10:19.440]  We gotta make a documentary about this.
[03:10:19.579 --> 03:10:21.620]  Not because it's not about me, but it's about showing people the power of God.
[03:10:23.030 --> 03:10:25.989]  That God literally told me all this stuff.
[03:10:26.370 --> 03:10:29.309]  And told me basically how it was all going to happen in this download.
[03:10:29.329 --> 03:10:30.129]  I couldn't even understand.
[03:10:30.389 --> 03:10:35.930]  Because you get the download and then it's like you get the battle orders as you need it.
[03:10:36.670 --> 03:10:38.969]  And we would have done much better.
[03:10:39.649 --> 03:10:41.110]  And I know that goes for all you as well.
[03:10:41.229 --> 03:10:42.590]  We're all contributing.
[03:10:43.149 --> 03:10:45.629]  If I would have just received it and followed the orders.
[03:10:46.629 --> 03:10:49.049]  And I just constantly sometimes have to go, okay...
[03:10:50.430 --> 03:10:51.450]  What am I supposed to do?
[03:10:51.590 --> 03:10:56.850]  And then if I just listen, I don't hear an audible voice, but I'm just...
[03:10:56.850 --> 03:10:59.430]  If I just listen, then I'm...
[03:10:59.430 --> 03:11:00.709]  Oh, yeah, that's what I'll do.
[03:11:00.829 --> 03:11:01.870]  And it's just amazing.
[03:11:04.149 --> 03:11:04.549]  And...
[03:11:04.549 --> 03:11:08.149]  The New World Order does not like us tapping into the Holy Spirit.
[03:11:08.649 --> 03:11:10.569]  And we have a direct connection to God.
[03:11:11.350 --> 03:11:18.870]  And yes, I am a fallen creature, and we all see through a rose color darkly that distorts God's light that shines through us, but...
[03:11:19.940 --> 03:11:21.479]  It is spectacular.
[03:11:21.899 --> 03:11:23.180]  I mean, look around you.
[03:11:23.799 --> 03:11:26.459]  You're on a planet around a giant ball of fire.
[03:11:26.739 --> 03:11:33.700]  You can point your own personal telescope out and look at galaxies thousands or millions of light years away.
[03:11:34.540 --> 03:11:38.180]  And I mean, it's just all the cool, crazy stuff.
[03:11:38.399 --> 03:11:45.940]  I mean, just life and the passion and the enjoyment and the experiences.
[03:11:45.940 --> 03:11:48.180]  And it's just so amazing.
[03:11:49.120 --> 03:11:51.459]  God is infinity real.
[03:11:52.420 --> 03:12:01.379]  God is ultra green, regenerative, always good, always right, always pure.
[03:12:01.639 --> 03:12:04.280]  It's just so good.
[03:12:04.680 --> 03:12:05.879]  Total completion.
[03:12:06.819 --> 03:12:07.680]  Timelessness.
[03:12:08.459 --> 03:12:09.319]  There is no past.
[03:12:09.420 --> 03:12:10.540]  There is no present.
[03:12:10.639 --> 03:12:11.280]  There is no future.
[03:12:11.399 --> 03:12:13.659]  There is only oneness with the Father.
[03:12:14.620 --> 03:12:29.139]  And then God creates the green fields of the universe and the free will and the perfect union of male and female in the master plan.
[03:12:30.879 --> 03:12:39.520]  The total manifestation of absolute, complete Timeless, unending, total perfection.
[03:12:40.180 --> 03:12:47.379]  And the final piece to perfection is to create the new free will that is imperfect.
[03:12:48.700 --> 03:12:54.959]  Because you couldn't just be given absolute total perfection as a sentient creature made in the image of God.
[03:12:55.540 --> 03:13:02.219]  You had to be given the potential to do your own free will.
[03:13:06.110 --> 03:13:08.569]  And the Satanists will say, God is a sadist.
[03:13:09.250 --> 03:13:12.290]  I'm not a sadist, and I'm not God, but it's a smaller version of that.
[03:13:13.129 --> 03:13:14.110]  Like in the fractal.
[03:13:15.809 --> 03:13:16.850]  As above, so below.
[03:13:17.649 --> 03:13:18.469]  I have children.
[03:13:18.629 --> 03:13:20.270]  They could end up being murderers, serial killers.
[03:13:20.370 --> 03:13:20.569]  They're not.
[03:13:20.670 --> 03:13:20.989]  They're great.
[03:13:21.209 --> 03:13:23.409]  But I did that, and someday they'll die.
[03:13:23.409 --> 03:13:24.530]  Oh, you can say, I killed my children.
[03:13:24.649 --> 03:13:25.389]  No, I didn't do that.
[03:13:25.729 --> 03:13:28.069]  I wanted to be with new sentient free will creatures.
[03:13:29.020 --> 03:13:30.260]  And so I did it!

[03:14:30.969 --> 03:14:34.649]  All right, y'all, so I got an exclusive update for the Infowars audience.
[03:14:34.649 --> 03:14:35.790]  We're here on the ground.
[03:14:35.989 --> 03:14:38.309]  I'm at our headquarters here for the Pennsylvania Chase.
[03:14:38.530 --> 03:14:42.809]  We're analyzing these numbers as they come in, and we're trying to understand where we are.
[03:14:43.170 --> 03:14:44.370]  Here's the skinny, okay?
[03:14:44.649 --> 03:14:54.069]  When you look at Democrat returns in terms of their mail-in ballots, Joe Biden won early votes by 1.4 million in 2020.
[03:14:54.649 --> 03:15:05.709]  Right now, for 2024, Kamala, based on all the numbers of both Democrat returns, Republican returns, and independents, it looks like she's only going to win by 600,000.
[03:15:05.989 --> 03:15:06.729]  Think about that.
[03:15:06.870 --> 03:15:12.750]  So instead of going into the election up 1.4 million votes, they're only going to be up 600,000.
[03:15:12.809 --> 03:15:13.930]  Now listen, we're still down.
[03:15:14.170 --> 03:15:16.989]  So we're going to need record turnout across the state.
[03:15:17.170 --> 03:15:20.290]  We need every Republican, if you have a ballot, get it back in.
[03:15:20.780 --> 03:15:25.700]  If you don't have a ballot, show up at the polls, vote at your precinct on Election Day.
[03:15:25.959 --> 03:15:33.079]  But this is about making sure that we do what we did in 2020, which was Trump won Election Day by 1.3 million.
[03:15:33.420 --> 03:15:38.059]  Right now, we only need to win Election Day by roughly 600,000 and change.
[03:15:38.079 --> 03:15:41.139]  We'll say 750, just to give ourselves a little wiggle room.
[03:15:41.719 --> 03:15:42.479]  But we're encouraged.
[03:15:42.600 --> 03:15:45.440]  We've got 120 of our full-time ballot chasers out there.
[03:15:45.579 --> 03:15:50.659]  We've knocked 500,000 doors across Pennsylvania to try to flip the Keystone State.
[03:15:50.979 --> 03:15:54.420]  And we believe that if we win PA, we win the White House.
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:16:01.600]  Remember, Trump and these other statewides have averaged 20% of all mail-in ballots when you compare Republican to Democrat.
[03:16:01.920 --> 03:16:10.139]  Our whole program, the PHA, is about getting Trump to 33% versus Kamala Harris's when you look at just their mail-in votes.
[03:16:10.340 --> 03:16:11.420]  We're going to get there.
[03:16:11.520 --> 03:16:12.840]  We've got today to get it done.
[03:16:13.100 --> 03:16:15.000]  But I'm really hoping we pull off a victory.
[03:16:15.120 --> 03:16:17.360]  And if we win PA, we take the White House.
[03:16:17.520 --> 03:16:19.819]  Appreciate InfoWars for everything you guys do.
[03:16:19.940 --> 03:16:21.000]  Keep spreading the truth.
[03:16:21.620 --> 03:16:22.819]  Alright, he shot that today.
[03:16:22.860 --> 03:16:24.219]  He's got updates for us.
[03:16:24.260 --> 03:16:25.799]  He's a big voting rights activist.
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:27.979]  PHAs.com.
[03:16:28.120 --> 03:16:29.180]  Cliff Maloney.
[03:16:29.639 --> 03:16:30.579]  Cliff, quick update.
[03:16:30.760 --> 03:16:32.600]  What are you seeing in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania?
[03:16:32.600 --> 03:16:36.239]  We're seeing a lot of chicanery, but we're also seeing a lot of good court rulings.
[03:16:36.299 --> 03:16:36.899]  What's really happening?
[03:16:37.829 --> 03:16:40.270]  Yeah, hey Alex, appreciate you guys having me as always.
[03:16:40.649 --> 03:16:47.690]  Look, early this morning, 7am polls open and right away we saw, you know, some of the shenanigans that we typically see.
[03:16:47.870 --> 03:16:52.809]  And that is that about five counties in Pennsylvania had voting machine scanners.
[03:16:52.989 --> 03:16:57.209]  So I'm not talking about the actual machines, but the machines that scan the ballots.
[03:16:57.370 --> 03:16:59.629]  And what happened was they were malfunctioning.
[03:16:59.709 --> 03:17:00.350]  They weren't reading.
[03:17:00.889 --> 03:17:08.430]  And so I'm happy to say that four of them fixed it within about 30 minutes to 45 minutes, which is still detrimental to Trump.
[03:17:08.649 --> 03:17:10.510]  But at least they got it fixed quickly.
[03:17:10.690 --> 03:17:14.489]  But one of these other counties, Cambria County, you know, they're still having issues.
[03:17:14.729 --> 03:17:16.850]  And so I'll give the RNC credit.
[03:17:17.110 --> 03:17:19.350]  You know, Whatley and Trump filed suit immediately.
[03:17:19.350 --> 03:17:20.350]  They took action.
[03:17:20.569 --> 03:17:26.149]  And now Cambria County has agreed to extend their voting until 10 p.m.
[03:17:26.479 --> 03:17:31.680]  And so what you're seeing in that county, which I'm still a little nervous about, is this is a red county, Alex.
[03:17:31.879 --> 03:17:35.700]  Trump won this county by 40 percentage points, right?
[03:17:35.860 --> 03:17:45.700]  So this is obviously not a good thing, but they're taking the ballots and they're placing them in a lockbox and they're apparently going to hand count them if they're not able to get these scanners to work.
[03:17:46.159 --> 03:17:47.200]  So that's the negative.
[03:17:47.399 --> 03:17:51.520]  The positive right now is we are seeing lines like crazy.
[03:17:51.680 --> 03:17:55.100]  I'm talking record turnout in a lot of these red counties.
[03:17:55.319 --> 03:18:02.159]  But when you look at Philly and you look at some of these collar counties around Philadelphia, southeastern PA, it's quick.
[03:18:02.420 --> 03:18:07.159]  I mean, the lines are not bustling like they are in some of the deep red counties.
[03:18:12.560 --> 03:18:18.440]  What about all of the reports in the key Republican districts that they're having all these machine problems?
[03:18:19.579 --> 03:18:24.079]  Yeah, and so I think with those reports, I mean, you've seen them get fixed in four of them.
[03:18:24.719 --> 03:18:26.379]  We're continuing to monitor it.
[03:18:26.479 --> 03:18:28.120]  And look, Alex, we knew they would try to do this.
[03:18:28.239 --> 03:18:36.620]  I mean, when the majority of your people show up on the right on election day because we want the most secure election possible, we know we're going to deal with this.
[03:18:36.799 --> 03:18:42.020]  The problem the left has this cycle, Alex, which is good news for us, Is there people just don't care?
[03:18:42.399 --> 03:18:49.299]  I mean, I got to tell you, some of the things we're doing in Philadelphia and the Philadelphia suburbs, these black men, they hate Kamala Harris.
[03:18:49.500 --> 03:18:50.840]  I mean, they can't stand her.
[03:18:51.120 --> 03:18:53.100]  They're excited about Trump.
[03:18:53.219 --> 03:18:54.940]  And this is different from 16.
[03:18:55.260 --> 03:18:56.840]  It's different from 2020.
[03:18:57.159 --> 03:18:59.879]  You know, these black men, this isn't me just talking about a poll.
[03:19:00.100 --> 03:19:05.860]  I got 25 black dudes on my team that are talking to black men in Philadelphia, right?
[03:19:06.040 --> 03:19:06.860]  This is a shift.
[03:19:07.260 --> 03:19:21.020]  And I think these blue collar folks are moving in that direction, but it makes it harder for Democrats to cheat because a lot of these people that they used to rely on to kind of pad the numbers of legitimate votes, well, they're not requesting ballots and they're not showing up.
[03:19:21.159 --> 03:19:23.200]  I think all that's very good for Donald Trump.
[03:19:26.579 --> 03:19:29.040]  Any other angles in closing you want to get through to people?
[03:19:30.120 --> 03:19:37.530]  Yeah, I think, listen, if anybody in Pennsylvania or you know anybody in Pennsylvania that has a mail-in ballot, They need to get it back.
[03:19:37.709 --> 03:19:39.170]  You can take it to your county office.
[03:19:39.430 --> 03:19:40.889]  Don't trust the post office.
[03:19:41.069 --> 03:19:41.809]  It's election day.
[03:19:41.989 --> 03:19:43.829]  Okay, that's been our message the whole time.
[03:19:44.030 --> 03:19:45.170]  And I tell people that.
[03:19:45.350 --> 03:19:46.729]  Do not trust the post office.
[03:19:46.870 --> 03:19:48.709]  Take it to the county and drop it off.
[03:19:48.850 --> 03:19:56.549]  If you can't go to your county office, go to the polls, surrender your ballot, and demand that they let you cast a new ballot in person.
[03:19:56.850 --> 03:19:57.770]  That will count.
[03:19:58.000 --> 03:19:59.600]  And look, Alex, I got to say this.
[03:19:59.680 --> 03:20:01.120]  I appreciate everything you guys do.
[03:20:01.920 --> 03:20:03.700]  Pennsylvania will decide the White House.
[03:20:03.879 --> 03:20:06.940]  We've got America First Patriots not afraid to speak the truth.
[03:20:07.139 --> 03:20:08.940]  We're running the show here on the ground.
[03:20:09.139 --> 03:20:12.020]  This is not some political consultant operation.
[03:20:12.319 --> 03:20:21.500]  This is real grassroots, people that watch Infowars, and I think we're going to flip PA, and that's going to win Trump the White House come polls closing tonight.
[03:20:21.819 --> 03:20:22.299]  All right.
[03:20:22.399 --> 03:20:23.600]  Give us updates later this evening.
[03:20:23.719 --> 03:20:25.100]  Cliff Maloney, thank you so much.
[03:20:25.280 --> 03:20:27.020]  At Maloney on X. We'll talk to you soon.
[03:20:27.860 --> 03:20:28.479]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:20:29.180 --> 03:20:29.420]  Okay.
[03:20:31.299 --> 03:20:32.739]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[03:20:32.879 --> 03:20:35.600]  And as I said, we've got huge guest analysts.
[03:20:35.879 --> 03:20:36.340]  You name them.
[03:20:36.479 --> 03:20:42.840]  They're on Stephen Crowder, Roger Stone, General Flynn, Robert Barnes, Owen Schroyer on the big board.
[03:20:42.860 --> 03:20:43.719]  He's really good at that.
[03:20:43.920 --> 03:20:47.600]  Former sportscaster, you know, giving you all the numbers.
[03:20:47.799 --> 03:20:51.340]  And, you know, as that goes, we'll obviously know a lot more about 678 tonight.
[03:20:51.340 --> 03:20:52.200]  It's going to be crazy.
[03:20:53.469 --> 03:20:55.489]  We are going to be here live on air.
[03:20:55.649 --> 03:20:58.930]  And again, this is not a spectator sport.
[03:20:59.290 --> 03:21:00.790]  This is not where you sit in the bleachers.
[03:21:00.889 --> 03:21:15.129]  I know you already know that, most of you, but for those that don't, when you go to Real Alex Jones on X and you take the network feed and the feed of my show and you share it and say, here's the forbidden feeds...
[03:21:16.620 --> 03:21:20.399]  Of live, censored coverage of what's really happened with the election.
[03:21:20.860 --> 03:21:22.899]  Here are the feeds they don't want you to see.
[03:21:23.840 --> 03:21:25.620]  Share everyone you know and tell them to share it.
[03:21:25.940 --> 03:21:27.680]  That creates a chain reaction.
[03:21:27.860 --> 03:21:29.079]  And this is the key to everything.
[03:21:29.920 --> 03:21:31.139]  And I harp on it.
[03:21:31.520 --> 03:21:36.600]  So, we've had streams the last month with 40 million viewers in 24 hours.
[03:21:38.139 --> 03:21:38.860]  One stream.
[03:21:39.780 --> 03:21:49.379]  One day we had 60 million people watch us on XLN. And the left did a bunch of stuff to try to mitigate that and a bunch of false reporting they do on it to drive the algorithm.
[03:21:49.500 --> 03:21:50.940]  It doesn't work when you overpower it.
[03:21:52.020 --> 03:21:57.340]  So like it, share it, go to the backup feed in case something happens to X, which I wouldn't put past the globalists.
[03:21:57.379 --> 03:21:59.520]  You're shutting it down or attacking it or cyber-attacking it.
[03:21:59.579 --> 03:22:03.700]  We got feeds at ban.video and infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:22:03.860 --> 03:22:04.239]  Share those.
[03:22:04.360 --> 03:22:05.100]  Say backup feed.
[03:22:06.779 --> 03:22:08.959]  Go now to at Real Alex Jones.
[03:22:09.100 --> 03:22:10.959]  If you're not an ex-person, an ex-member, go get on there.
[03:22:11.180 --> 03:22:16.219]  But if you're not on ex, go share from infowars.com forward slash show or man.video just in the live show feed area.
[03:22:16.700 --> 03:22:20.780]  That way you should take over the front page of man.video because you've got to go to the Alex Jones channel and click the live feed and all that.
[03:22:20.920 --> 03:22:21.860]  It's up in the left-hand corner.
[03:22:22.020 --> 03:22:22.959]  It's easy to do, but whatever.
[03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:24.899]  Just infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:22:25.100 --> 03:22:26.000]  That has all the streams there too.
[03:22:27.559 --> 03:22:30.360]  Go there, share it, and it will create a chain reaction.
[03:22:31.370 --> 03:22:36.350]  And again, usually when my show ends every day for the Alex Jones show at 3 p.m., it just loops the show again.
[03:22:36.950 --> 03:22:38.670]  It gets millions and millions and millions more.
[03:22:38.909 --> 03:22:40.010]  That won't happen today.
[03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:48.350]  When this show ends, this broadcast just continues on in 18 and a half minutes, it will go right into the war room and Owen.
[03:22:48.590 --> 03:22:52.110]  And then I'll be around popping in, bringing in breaking news.
[03:22:52.170 --> 03:22:53.809]  I'm going to be here, you know, I'm going to sleep here tonight.
[03:22:55.360 --> 03:22:57.579]  And then it will just go right through.
[03:22:57.700 --> 03:23:04.479]  I'll be back hosting at 6 o'clock with Owen, with all these other special guests, in studio, out of studio, your calls, everything.
[03:23:04.940 --> 03:23:06.319]  This is the place to watch.
[03:23:06.420 --> 03:23:07.239]  I know you already know that.
[03:23:07.920 --> 03:23:08.739]  Tell others.
[03:23:09.739 --> 03:23:11.379]  And we're going to be simulcasting with Crowder.
[03:23:11.479 --> 03:23:14.319]  He paid over a million bucks to get into the actual feeds.
[03:23:14.379 --> 03:23:17.319]  We show you the news feeds ourselves, but they can manipulate those.
[03:23:17.879 --> 03:23:21.739]  He'll be in there because their analysts look at it, decide what to show you.
[03:23:22.139 --> 03:23:28.280]  Crowder's gone in and bought access to all that so that he can then have the live time.
[03:23:28.379 --> 03:23:31.079]  We'll be checking with him and so much more.
[03:23:31.200 --> 03:23:32.920]  Gavin McGinnis, everybody, tonight.
[03:23:33.639 --> 03:23:35.280]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:23:35.459 --> 03:23:42.350]  Real Alex Jones on X. And Infowars on X. And if they try to take that down, at AJN Live.
[03:23:42.649 --> 03:23:43.350]  Alex Jones Network.
[03:23:44.069 --> 03:23:44.969]  AJN. It's the initials.
[03:23:45.190 --> 03:23:46.090]  AJN Live.
[03:23:47.030 --> 03:23:52.590]  And there are the coordinates right there on screen for you, my friends.
[03:23:53.790 --> 03:23:59.889]  And we'll retweet that image on Real Alex Jones here in a few minutes.
[03:23:59.889 --> 03:24:02.329]  You can share that with everybody you know as well.
[03:24:02.670 --> 03:24:03.989]  I want to say great job to the crew.
[03:24:05.109 --> 03:24:08.649]  Before we go back to these calls quickly, just to remind you all, we can't do this without you.
[03:24:09.190 --> 03:24:11.809]  InfoWars is up for auction to be shut down next Tuesday.
[03:24:12.270 --> 03:24:13.149]  What is the 13th?
[03:24:13.229 --> 03:24:13.829]  It's a Tuesday or Wednesday.
[03:24:14.469 --> 03:24:16.010]  And we can be shut down instantly.
[03:24:16.469 --> 03:24:17.549]  I have the bad guys buy it.
[03:24:17.590 --> 03:24:18.250]  They say they will.
[03:24:18.489 --> 03:24:19.729]  That's part of them buying it.
[03:24:19.790 --> 03:24:23.129]  We can be shut down immediately as soon as the wire clears, sir.
[03:24:23.649 --> 03:24:28.549]  Well, we'll just be right back from the AJN Studios.
[03:24:30.750 --> 03:24:32.190]  And we need everybody to remember that.
[03:24:32.309 --> 03:24:36.389]  And we pay for satellites and uplinks and the computers and the systems.
[03:24:36.610 --> 03:24:38.709]  We stay on all those radio stations, all those systems.
[03:24:39.430 --> 03:24:41.909]  But it takes money to do that and the legal to battle our enemies.
[03:24:43.370 --> 03:24:45.129]  So, support us.
[03:24:45.190 --> 03:24:47.950]  Get great supplements, great t-shirts, great books, great ball caps.
[03:24:50.139 --> 03:24:55.399]  At thealexjonesstore.com and our other great sponsor for amazing supplements, drjonesnatorials.com.
[03:24:55.540 --> 03:24:59.200]  It's got a lot of new products in that are amazing, drjonesnatorials.com.
[03:24:59.340 --> 03:25:02.600]  And here is my new favorite hat, Trashy American.
[03:25:04.739 --> 03:25:06.139]  Because we're all trash, right?
[03:25:06.959 --> 03:25:08.379]  No, the globalists are the trash.
[03:25:08.899 --> 03:25:18.639]  So get a great hat, fund the Infowar, thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnatorials.com with the coordinates of getting great products and funding the Second American Revolution.
[03:25:19.420 --> 03:25:22.840]  It's just as important as voting for Trump is funding the organizations that are under global attack.
[03:25:23.440 --> 03:25:29.000]  Because what we say here, what goes out, is picked up by not just the general public, which is very important.
[03:25:29.059 --> 03:25:30.879]  It's picked up by the intelligentsia of the resistance.
[03:25:31.260 --> 03:25:34.120]  I mean, people ask, who tells me what to say and to do?
[03:25:34.280 --> 03:25:35.879]  My own research, the Holy Spirit.
[03:25:36.180 --> 03:25:45.200]  And quite frankly, we had to pick one person in the world who, they admit, basically creates the resistance systems, ideas, analysis...
[03:25:46.069 --> 03:25:46.530]  It's me.
[03:25:46.969 --> 03:25:48.670]  So, I'm in charge.
[03:25:48.870 --> 03:25:50.270]  And I don't mean that in an arrogant way.
[03:25:50.409 --> 03:25:51.530]  The enemy knows that.
[03:25:51.690 --> 03:25:57.729]  I mean, doing this 30 plus years, all the films, the work, the crew, our guests, this broadcast is in charge.
[03:25:58.049 --> 03:26:00.670]  This broadcast is seen as the thing.
[03:26:02.379 --> 03:26:05.819]  And yesterday, Elon Musk and Rogan were talking about that.
[03:26:05.940 --> 03:26:07.500]  We played the wrong clip earlier.
[03:26:07.659 --> 03:26:09.059]  It was okay because I sent them two clips.
[03:26:09.360 --> 03:26:10.639]  It's the longer one in context.
[03:26:10.739 --> 03:26:12.459]  We're talking about J6 and being staged.
[03:26:12.579 --> 03:26:13.600]  And they talk about it for 10 minutes.
[03:26:13.700 --> 03:26:14.479]  This is still a short clip.
[03:26:14.600 --> 03:26:15.139]  Get it ready, please.
[03:26:15.620 --> 03:26:22.399]  But then they go into how I expose the WEF and how they attack peaceful people during that protest in 1999.
[03:26:22.559 --> 03:26:27.239]  The Delta Force ran that for Clinton to set up the protesters back when the left was anti-globalist.
[03:26:27.340 --> 03:26:28.260]  They wanted to get them on board.
[03:26:28.299 --> 03:26:30.440]  So they just outlawed the left basically doing that.
[03:26:31.010 --> 03:26:31.709]  That's what we're talking about.
[03:26:31.829 --> 03:26:33.530]  And the realization of false flags, as Dr.
[03:26:33.750 --> 03:26:35.350]  Darren Beatty said earlier, is critical.
[03:26:35.469 --> 03:26:38.610]  It's now gone mega-mainstream.
[03:26:39.209 --> 03:26:41.469]  It's reached escape velocity.
[03:26:41.469 --> 03:26:42.129]  Here's the clue.
[03:26:42.799 --> 03:26:49.799]  When they de-platformed the sitting president, de-platformed Trump, that was just insane.
[03:26:51.719 --> 03:26:57.180]  And the things he was posting, he was posting good things.
[03:26:57.319 --> 03:27:04.639]  He was saying, hey, do not riot, don't do any destruction of property, please stay calm.
[03:27:04.799 --> 03:27:06.680]  That's the kind of stuff he was posting.
[03:27:07.290 --> 03:27:09.629]  And you're like, uh, what's wrong with that?
[03:27:09.850 --> 03:27:17.870]  And then there's the fact that we know that there was agents in the crowd that were agent provocateurs that were encouraging people to do illegal shit.
[03:27:18.030 --> 03:27:19.370]  We know that for a fact.
[03:27:19.969 --> 03:27:32.120]  That was always the big Alex Jones type tinfoil hat conspiracy theory, because Alex proposed that back at the World Trade Organization protests I believe we're in Seattle in the 90s.
[03:27:32.500 --> 03:27:37.139]  And they sent in agent provocateur, started smashing things, lighting things on fire.
[03:27:37.420 --> 03:27:39.920]  Now all of a sudden a peaceful protest is no longer peaceful.
[03:27:40.079 --> 03:27:42.299]  They move in the cops, they shut everything down.
[03:27:42.459 --> 03:27:49.420]  They had it set up where it was a no protest zone, where you couldn't even have a pin that had the WTO with a red line through it.
[03:27:49.459 --> 03:27:51.239]  They wouldn't let you go in through to go to work.
[03:27:51.750 --> 03:27:52.889]  So you couldn't protest.
[03:27:52.989 --> 03:27:54.969]  You couldn't exercise your First Amendment rights.
[03:27:55.370 --> 03:27:59.389]  You couldn't even, like, have a peaceful protest, a fucking sticker on your car.
[03:27:59.510 --> 03:28:00.190]  You couldn't have that.
[03:28:00.329 --> 03:28:01.250]  It's crazy.
[03:28:01.590 --> 03:28:02.010]  It is crazy.
[03:28:02.750 --> 03:28:03.850]  Wanted to get that in.
[03:28:04.010 --> 03:28:08.110]  Okay, in about 14 minutes, Owen Stroyer starts with amazing coverage.
[03:28:08.829 --> 03:28:09.649]  Fast-paced.
[03:28:10.149 --> 03:28:11.530]  I'll be back and forth with him.
[03:28:11.670 --> 03:28:12.750]  I'll be back at 6.
[03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:14.430]  Share those links, folks.
[03:28:14.489 --> 03:28:15.190]  It's important.
[03:28:15.930 --> 03:28:17.350]  All right, Klaus in Virginia.
[03:28:17.350 --> 03:28:18.809]  You're on the air in a key battleground state.
[03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:19.709]  Welcome, and thanks for calling.
[03:28:20.680 --> 03:28:22.979]  Thank you very much for your time, Alex.
[03:28:23.139 --> 03:28:23.760]  Big fan.
[03:28:23.979 --> 03:28:24.860]  God is good.
[03:28:25.479 --> 03:28:29.340]  And just boots on the ground here in Salem, Virginia.
[03:28:29.659 --> 03:28:34.780]  Last weekend, as you know, I'm sure Trump ended his rally campaign in Salem.
[03:28:35.059 --> 03:28:42.020]  I'm wondering just your general thoughts on why exactly he decided to end in Virginia, especially Salem.
[03:28:42.360 --> 03:29:01.379]  And two, there was a Roanoke College swim team that actually showed up at the rally because Yeah,
[03:29:02.059 --> 03:29:04.739]  well, I'll tell you the answer.
[03:29:05.020 --> 03:29:07.079]  I mean, you know, Trump's got his own strategists that are excellent.
[03:29:07.319 --> 03:29:08.920]  They know Virginia is very close in play.
[03:29:09.020 --> 03:29:10.840]  They think they've got Pennsylvania, so he's there.
[03:29:11.059 --> 03:29:25.540]  Plus, it's close to D.C. But, you know, expanding on that, instead of being intimidated when the trans cult that's run by the globalists to depopulate us and destroy the family attacks you and being scared of it, embrace it like they're doing.
[03:29:25.620 --> 03:29:29.139]  And exactly, if a man's competing in your sport, none of the women should be part of it.
[03:29:29.180 --> 03:29:30.280]  That'll shut it down immediately.
[03:29:30.659 --> 03:29:32.879]  And so, yeah, I think you answered your own question.
[03:29:34.620 --> 03:29:37.000]  Alright, and then I just had one more question.
[03:29:37.260 --> 03:29:40.940]  So, my mom was actually working as a ballot like...
[03:29:41.420 --> 03:29:43.959]  Ballot attendant during the 2016 election.
[03:29:44.360 --> 03:29:52.219]  And she was essentially tasked with being told to kind of check the ballots and make sure that there weren't any extra voting.
[03:29:52.219 --> 03:29:56.680]  But there was a room in Pennsylvania that she was not allowed to enter during the election.
[03:29:56.879 --> 03:29:59.799]  And that's where every single ballot ended up going.
[03:29:59.979 --> 03:30:03.079]  And no ballot analyzer was actually allowed that room.
[03:30:03.989 --> 03:30:07.110]  So I'm just kind of wondering why exactly we have people there.
[03:30:07.110 --> 03:30:12.329]  No, that's one of their big things is that they get the conservative ballots and they just put them in a room and don't count them.
[03:30:12.629 --> 03:30:14.409]  Oh, the machines are broke right now.
[03:30:14.489 --> 03:30:15.309]  Give us all your ballots.
[03:30:15.309 --> 03:30:15.950]  We'll take care of it.
[03:30:16.010 --> 03:30:16.889]  That's the standard procedure.
[03:30:17.049 --> 03:30:17.469]  Thank you, Klaus.
[03:30:17.590 --> 03:30:18.030]  Great questions.
[03:30:19.309 --> 03:30:21.190]  Chaz in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[03:30:21.290 --> 03:30:21.469]  Welcome.
[03:30:23.090 --> 03:30:23.889]  All right, Alex.
[03:30:24.149 --> 03:30:29.670]  The first thing I have to do, I can't remember who it was, but I have to think...
[03:30:31.849 --> 03:30:48.090]  Savage or Limbaugh for talking so horribly about you in 2014 because I was driving home one night from McDonald's when I was 17, my first job, and they said you were a crackpot, conspiracy theorist,
[03:30:48.270 --> 03:30:53.469]  and ever since then I went home, got on YouTube, and it's a wrap.
[03:30:53.670 --> 03:30:54.969]  I've been with you ever since.
[03:30:59.090 --> 03:31:00.270]  Any more now.
[03:31:01.509 --> 03:31:02.989]  My occupation's changed.
[03:31:03.170 --> 03:31:04.809]  I gotta get up at the crack of dawn.
[03:31:05.170 --> 03:31:07.110]  Work 10 and a half hours a day.
[03:31:07.889 --> 03:31:09.729]  This morning, I get up.
[03:31:10.450 --> 03:31:12.569]  I head straight to the polling place.
[03:31:13.170 --> 03:31:16.590]  And all I see...
[03:31:16.590 --> 03:31:18.750]  Luckily, I got there early enough.
[03:31:18.750 --> 03:31:20.270]  I was the fifth person in line.
[03:31:20.549 --> 03:31:25.309]  By the time they opened the doors, there was 60 to 70 people lined up.
[03:31:25.989 --> 03:31:29.069]  And 90% of them were guys just like me.
[03:31:29.800 --> 03:31:41.479]  Work boots, work shirts, just trying to get our vote in before we go to work for the day because we don't have time to do anything else.
[03:31:42.719 --> 03:31:46.879]  And we showed up to make sure that it's worth something in the end.
[03:31:48.319 --> 03:31:49.139]  Absolutely, sir.
[03:31:49.360 --> 03:31:51.959]  And even if they steal it, everybody's going to know it.
[03:31:52.020 --> 03:31:53.379]  So what you're feeling is the Great Awakening.
[03:31:53.500 --> 03:31:54.299]  God bless you, Chaz.
[03:31:54.540 --> 03:31:55.280]  Keep it up.
[03:31:56.010 --> 03:31:58.969]  Alright, let's go to Jerry in Florida.
[03:31:59.129 --> 03:31:59.790]  Jerry, thanks for calling.
[03:32:01.450 --> 03:32:02.690]  Hey, Alex.
[03:32:05.190 --> 03:32:06.069]  How we doing?
[03:32:06.290 --> 03:32:06.690]  Good, brother.
[03:32:07.030 --> 03:32:09.329]  It's a big election day, a lot of crazy stuff going on.
[03:32:10.209 --> 03:32:10.950]  Yeah, no kidding.
[03:32:11.129 --> 03:32:19.239]  So first off, I wanted to say, seeing you and Gavin McGinnis together, sorry about that, I'm That's the job, son.
[03:32:19.739 --> 03:32:22.760]  Seeing you and Owl get us together gives me a big reverie one.
[03:32:22.899 --> 03:32:25.040]  That is an absolute incredible duo.
[03:32:25.639 --> 03:32:26.700]  Brother, I've got to let you go.
[03:32:26.780 --> 03:32:28.459]  I appreciate your call, but your phone's having problems.
[03:32:28.819 --> 03:32:29.879]  Owl Killer, go ahead.
[03:32:29.940 --> 03:32:30.879]  You're on the air from Virginia.
[03:32:31.020 --> 03:32:31.219]  Welcome.
[03:32:32.479 --> 03:32:39.360]  Well, I just want to say, it definitely wasn't Michael Savage putting you down, that's for sure, because the guy actually loves you.
[03:32:39.440 --> 03:32:40.600]  He's always called you the warrior.
[03:32:41.040 --> 03:32:41.579]  Oh, yeah.
[03:32:41.719 --> 03:32:43.739]  No, Savage has never attacked me.
[03:32:43.940 --> 03:32:45.180]  It was Limbaugh, I remember.
[03:32:45.969 --> 03:32:48.430]  But, you know, Limbaugh came to the party at the end.
[03:32:48.549 --> 03:32:49.569]  I mean, he was overall good for us.
[03:32:49.610 --> 03:32:49.989]  We love him.
[03:32:51.250 --> 03:32:51.870]  Yeah, for sure.
[03:32:52.270 --> 03:32:57.670]  So, you know, with all this talk about Pennsylvania, why is everybody ignoring Wisconsin?
[03:32:57.770 --> 03:33:02.729]  Because I remember 2020, they said Trump was going to lose by like 19 points, and he was within a point.
[03:33:03.010 --> 03:33:03.190]  Yep.
[03:33:04.409 --> 03:33:07.229]  So, I mean, he wins Wisconsin, and the election's over.
[03:33:07.290 --> 03:33:07.989]  And I'll tell you something.
[03:33:08.430 --> 03:33:19.950]  You look at Drudge right now, the Drudge report does not seem to, out of Much hype that they had been putting behind Kamala, they don't seem too confident in her right now.
[03:33:20.110 --> 03:33:22.629]  Yeah, let's put up the Drudge Report right now, whoever runs it.
[03:33:23.409 --> 03:33:26.030]  Matt Drudge, if it's still you running it, put them out at the top.
[03:33:26.469 --> 03:33:28.129]  History or her story?
[03:33:28.569 --> 03:33:29.729]  America's biggest election.
[03:33:30.010 --> 03:33:32.049]  Yeah, he was totally going to win yesterday.
[03:33:32.190 --> 03:33:33.149]  It doesn't say that now, does it?
[03:33:34.430 --> 03:33:34.829]  Exactly.
[03:33:34.989 --> 03:33:36.309]  No, she was totally going to win yesterday.
[03:33:36.510 --> 03:33:42.409]  So, the one thing I want to bring up, so, with Elon coming up with this government...
[03:33:43.260 --> 03:33:44.819]  Basically, the accountability.
[03:33:45.940 --> 03:33:49.399]  What was the department that he's looking into creating?
[03:33:49.700 --> 03:33:51.479]  Basically, to look at the wasteful spending?
[03:33:52.879 --> 03:33:55.360]  It's the Government Efficiency Bureau.
[03:33:55.819 --> 03:33:56.719]  Efficiency, right?
[03:33:56.979 --> 03:33:58.399]  Is Ron Paul really on board?
[03:33:58.620 --> 03:34:01.000]  Because he tweeted out about it that he would be...
[03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:02.299]  No, no, Ron Paul's being...
[03:34:02.299 --> 03:34:03.659]  It's basically an endorsement of Trump.
[03:34:03.799 --> 03:34:05.680]  Yeah, Rogan, all of them endorse Trump.
[03:34:06.299 --> 03:34:07.860]  So, look at this.
[03:34:08.479 --> 03:34:24.709]  The one thing AI is good at The same way that BlackRock was able to pick out when they created that Genie software, whatever it was, to go through all the toxic assets, that is something that, after the 2008 financial collapse,
[03:34:24.870 --> 03:34:32.229]  that's how Larry Fink got his big start when he came up with that software program that looked at all the toxic assets and was able to weed it out.
[03:34:32.950 --> 03:34:35.530]  AI could cut the budget in half, literally in half.
[03:34:38.069 --> 03:34:46.010]  When you're talking about bringing people to justice, I actually think the best benefit for the country is literally pardon everybody across the board.
[03:34:46.590 --> 03:34:52.430]  And you don't even fire people, but give them their pension, but these departments are gone.
[03:34:52.430 --> 03:34:54.790]  And you never have to pay another person again when they die.
[03:34:54.790 --> 03:34:55.569]  It's over.
[03:34:56.799 --> 03:34:58.059]  We just move on from there.
[03:34:58.159 --> 03:35:04.260]  Because if these people have the fear that they're going to go to jail, it gives them a reason to create a stay-behind network.
[03:35:04.420 --> 03:35:06.360]  And that's exactly what happened in 2016.
[03:35:06.600 --> 03:35:09.440]  So let's move them into a sentia like they did with Napoleon.
[03:35:09.620 --> 03:35:13.180]  But actually, hey, you just can't have any more part in the government.
[03:35:13.180 --> 03:35:15.040]  But we need to move forward as a country.
[03:35:15.040 --> 03:35:20.959]  And I don't think retaliating against them legally, we just got to have blank pardons across the board.
[03:35:21.079 --> 03:35:26.180]  And if Trump does win, he should call Biden and tell Biden, hey, Pardon?
[03:35:26.360 --> 03:35:27.719]  Stop the stuff with Giuliani.
[03:35:27.899 --> 03:35:29.940]  Stop the stuff that's going on with the January...
[03:35:29.940 --> 03:35:31.559]  Well, Trump can pardon the January 6th people.
[03:35:31.840 --> 03:35:33.000]  Drop the charges against me.
[03:35:33.079 --> 03:35:33.659]  I'll pardon you.
[03:35:33.760 --> 03:35:34.520]  I'll pardon your son.
[03:35:34.680 --> 03:35:36.340]  They could even do it behind closed doors.
[03:35:36.500 --> 03:35:37.479]  I hear you, brother.
[03:35:37.639 --> 03:35:38.120]  Great points.
[03:35:38.200 --> 03:35:38.739]  Moving on to others.
[03:35:38.860 --> 03:35:39.239]  Thank you.
[03:35:39.559 --> 03:35:40.879]  Let's go to Dave in Iowa.
[03:35:41.100 --> 03:35:41.780]  Dave, you're on the air.
[03:35:41.879 --> 03:35:42.059]  Welcome.
[03:35:44.040 --> 03:35:46.540]  Alex, it's an honor and pleasure to talk to you.
[03:35:46.639 --> 03:35:50.079]  I know you hate having people tell you that, but it is an honor.
[03:35:50.079 --> 03:35:50.879]  No, I don't hate it.
[03:35:50.920 --> 03:35:53.200]  It's just every caller does it, and it happens 50 times a day.
[03:35:53.319 --> 03:35:54.540]  It's like, hey, I love you too, brother.
[03:35:54.819 --> 03:35:55.079]  Go ahead.
[03:35:55.100 --> 03:35:55.600]  What's on your mind?
[03:35:56.540 --> 03:35:57.120]  All right.
[03:35:57.139 --> 03:36:03.299]  So we're talking about the specter of the possibility of false flag attacks and things like that.
[03:36:03.500 --> 03:36:10.159]  Alex, you're not going to believe it, but two hours ago, Daily Mail, UK, here's the headline.
[03:36:11.970 --> 03:36:16.270]  We're good to go.
[03:36:20.540 --> 03:36:23.379]  Well, guys, pull that article about U.S. to test hypersonic missile.
[03:36:23.500 --> 03:36:26.420]  Yeah, their October surprise could be a full war with Russia.
[03:36:26.579 --> 03:36:27.040]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:36:27.079 --> 03:36:29.200]  We're all feeling good because we're waking up, taking things back.
[03:36:29.459 --> 03:36:30.899]  The globalists could do anything.
[03:36:30.899 --> 03:36:31.819]  So pray for peace.
[03:36:31.940 --> 03:36:33.079]  Pray for their plans to be stopped.
[03:36:33.319 --> 03:36:35.219]  Pray for a global awakening to accelerate.
[03:36:35.620 --> 03:36:36.540]  I'm glad you called.
[03:36:36.659 --> 03:36:36.920]  There it is.
[03:36:37.020 --> 03:36:38.719]  U.S. to test hypersonic nuclear missile tonight.
[03:36:39.059 --> 03:36:40.379]  Just hours after election polls close.
[03:36:40.540 --> 03:36:41.620]  They've been growing World War III fears.
[03:36:41.760 --> 03:36:41.940]  Wow.
[03:36:43.159 --> 03:36:44.000]  There you go.
[03:36:44.569 --> 03:36:45.149]  There you go.
[03:36:45.250 --> 03:36:50.110]  Yep, tonight's between 11.01pm and 5.01pm Pacific Standard Time.
[03:36:50.110 --> 03:36:54.829]  They're going to launch it from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base.
[03:36:56.649 --> 03:36:58.149]  Dave, I'm glad you got on.
[03:36:58.270 --> 03:36:59.530]  We've only got a minute and a half left.
[03:36:59.690 --> 03:37:00.090]  Thank you.
[03:37:00.329 --> 03:37:02.409]  All right, Warren, Exodus, and others.
[03:37:02.530 --> 03:37:03.209]  I can't get to you.
[03:37:03.329 --> 03:37:04.850]  My four hours is over.

[03:37:31.069 --> 03:37:32.569]  This is the People's Channel.
[03:37:33.350 --> 03:37:34.190]  Pass it on.
[03:37:34.309 --> 03:37:36.030]  And, man, it is going to be amazing.

[03:37:41.090 --> 03:37:41.930]  Please listen to Owen.
[03:37:42.030 --> 03:37:44.129]  He's going to have great analysis and all the breaking news.
[03:37:44.250 --> 03:37:44.969]  They're loaded for bear.
[03:37:45.389 --> 03:37:48.309]  He's in the chair right now, right through that door of the studio right there.
[03:37:48.450 --> 03:37:49.110]  I'll be in here.
[03:37:49.950 --> 03:37:52.110]  All day, 6 o'clock tonight, right through.
[03:37:52.350 --> 03:38:00.049]  And whatever happens, we're going to stay on the air until Trump wins or they start World War III and nuclear bombs rain down.
[03:38:01.350 --> 03:38:02.110]  Great job.
[03:38:02.750 --> 03:38:03.950]  And I mean it for the crew.
[03:38:04.090 --> 03:38:04.770]  Pray for them as well.
[03:38:04.770 --> 03:38:05.590]  They have put up with me.
[03:38:05.649 --> 03:38:08.770]  I'm telling you, I am wound up like nothing ever before.
[03:38:08.950 --> 03:38:09.989]  I feel the energy.
[03:38:10.510 --> 03:38:12.489]  And just everybody's doing a great job.
[03:38:12.590 --> 03:38:14.770]  The viewers and listeners, you are the men and women in the arena.
[03:38:14.770 --> 03:38:15.829]  I salute you.
[03:38:16.629 --> 03:38:17.809]  We are fighting the globalist hard.
[03:38:18.030 --> 03:38:24.190]  I didn't get to Congress trying to pass putting secret bio vaccines in your lettuce and tomatoes.
[03:38:24.350 --> 03:38:25.049]  I'm not joking.
[03:38:25.229 --> 03:38:26.090]  That's in Congress today.
[03:38:26.670 --> 03:38:27.209]  I will.
[03:38:27.389 --> 03:38:28.370]  I want you to cover that.
[03:38:28.510 --> 03:38:32.389]  I mean, there's so much we didn't get to, but it's all coming up on these feeds.
[03:38:32.489 --> 03:38:34.549]  But this isn't, again, a spectator.
[03:38:35.030 --> 03:38:36.889]  This is action, action, action.
[03:38:37.030 --> 03:38:38.190]  Go to Relox Show and share the link.
[03:38:38.290 --> 03:38:39.309]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:38:39.389 --> 03:38:39.930]  Show the link now.
[03:38:40.559 --> 03:38:40.979]  All right.
[03:38:41.100 --> 03:38:42.860]  The War Room Owen Schroyer coming up.
[03:38:43.020 --> 03:38:43.579]  Live coverage.
[03:38:43.680 --> 03:38:46.840]  The 2024 Mega Election is live now.
[03:38:47.860 --> 03:38:50.000]  So, I'm just asking you to keep me in the fight.
[03:38:50.440 --> 03:38:53.860]  And we got great t-shirts and incredible blow-you-away supplements and everything.
[03:38:54.020 --> 03:38:56.299]  And our great sponsor, the AlexJonesStore.com.
[03:38:56.600 --> 03:39:01.600]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction.
[03:39:01.760 --> 03:39:03.399]  Because I hadn't really...
[03:39:03.399 --> 03:39:04.940]  There's other folks on this.
[03:39:05.040 --> 03:39:06.139]  Other folks that are great run this.
[03:39:06.280 --> 03:39:06.860]  The folks at Bigly.
[03:39:07.180 --> 03:39:08.319]  Great Patriot backers.
[03:39:08.399 --> 03:39:09.000]  Total Patriots.
[03:39:09.040 --> 03:39:09.520]  J-Sexers.
[03:39:09.579 --> 03:39:10.000]  You name it.
[03:39:11.069 --> 03:39:13.229]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[03:39:13.409 --> 03:39:17.190]  So when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[03:39:17.790 --> 03:39:27.989]  So if you're a member of the Alice Jones VIP Club at alicejonesstore.com forward slash VIP, or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation.
[03:39:28.430 --> 03:39:30.790]  We don't know what the future holds for the operation.
[03:39:31.239 --> 03:39:35.260]  The following information I'm about to relay to you is imperative so we can stay in touch.
[03:39:35.420 --> 03:39:38.479]  You can get great products and keep me on the air one way or the other along with the crew.
[03:39:38.840 --> 03:39:40.079]  Monthly member credits.
[03:39:40.420 --> 03:39:45.700]  Every month as a VIP member you get $40 of free store credit.
[03:39:46.159 --> 03:39:47.159]  Did you hear what I just said?
[03:39:47.260 --> 03:39:47.620]  That's right.
[03:39:47.840 --> 03:39:51.280]  It's like money in your pocket with the best products on the planet.
[03:39:51.659 --> 03:39:55.620]  So you pay 30 bucks to be a VIP, and then you get 40 bucks free.
[03:39:55.760 --> 03:39:56.700]  That's $10 you make.
[03:39:56.940 --> 03:40:07.559]  All the Alex Jones products, the best prices, we're talking about 10 to even 40% off the already existing sales, so sometimes it becomes lost leaders, in the store 24-7, 365 days a year.
[03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:11.479]  This is an unbeatable pricing you'll never find anywhere else.
[03:40:12.020 --> 03:40:20.260]  Automatic double entries in any of the giveaways, like the awesome turbo diesel super truck, $138,000 value, plus $1,000 cash.
[03:40:21.130 --> 03:40:23.610]  The winner of the sweepstakes will be announced the 30th this month.
[03:40:23.850 --> 03:40:24.629]  You want to win?
[03:40:24.850 --> 03:40:25.770]  I know you do.
[03:40:25.969 --> 03:40:28.530]  Because the VIP will get double entries in every single giveaway.
[03:40:28.809 --> 03:40:31.170]  No effort, just double your chances just like that.
[03:40:31.649 --> 03:40:33.409]  Exclusive VIP-only giveaways.
[03:40:33.610 --> 03:40:35.309]  This is where it gets big, folks.
[03:40:35.430 --> 03:40:38.930]  VIP members get entered into their own exclusive giveaways every month.
[03:40:39.030 --> 03:40:40.649]  Nobody else is allowed in these.
[03:40:41.000 --> 03:40:43.459]  Early access to products, promos, and giveaways.
[03:40:43.760 --> 03:40:48.719]  VIP members get first access to new products, promotions, and giveaways before anyone else.
[03:40:48.899 --> 03:40:49.959]  You're in the know.
[03:40:50.360 --> 03:40:52.219]  Oh, and did I mention orders over $99?
[03:40:52.840 --> 03:40:53.420]  Pre-shipping.
[03:40:53.440 --> 03:40:56.559]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[03:40:56.739 --> 03:40:57.979]  It just goes on from there.
[03:40:58.540 --> 03:41:05.079]  So, theallocshowstore.com forward slash VIP. Or just at the top of theallocshowstore.com, you see the VIP button.
[03:41:05.469 --> 03:41:07.409]  We're fighting the new world order.
[03:41:07.610 --> 03:41:09.309]  I don't have millionaire backers.
[03:41:09.450 --> 03:41:14.010]  I am not controlled by anybody but my own soul, my own brain.
[03:41:14.209 --> 03:41:15.469]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[03:41:16.209 --> 03:41:23.469]  Theallowshowstore.com It's up to you whether you want to back The number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[03:41:23.750 --> 03:41:32.790]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[03:41:32.950 --> 03:41:40.030]  And I just don't know why I'm such a lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[03:41:40.170 --> 03:41:42.170]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[03:41:42.690 --> 03:41:45.129]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[03:41:45.569 --> 03:41:46.370]  We've already...
[03:41:47.239 --> 03:41:48.340]  Just devastated them.
[03:41:48.479 --> 03:41:51.500]  I mean, world government, the dual orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[03:41:51.739 --> 03:41:53.059]  The whole world's turning against them.
[03:41:53.520 --> 03:41:54.639]  They're super dangerous.
[03:41:54.819 --> 03:41:57.340]  They should throw in the kitchen sink at us, try to keep control.
[03:41:57.760 --> 03:42:08.020]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've ever understood, that I should let these criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[03:42:08.200 --> 03:42:09.819]  So, again, I don't give up.
[03:42:09.940 --> 03:42:12.700]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[03:42:13.190 --> 03:42:16.329]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[03:42:16.530 --> 03:42:18.790]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[03:42:18.909 --> 03:42:20.270]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[03:42:20.430 --> 03:42:28.969]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over the social credit score, and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[03:42:29.170 --> 03:42:33.969]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[03:42:35.069 --> 03:42:37.329]  And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[03:42:38.969 --> 03:42:39.829]  I mean, it's just...
[03:42:39.829 --> 03:42:41.170]  This is a joke.
[03:42:41.450 --> 03:42:42.649]  This is ridiculous.
[03:42:43.129 --> 03:42:44.209]  We're changing the world.
[03:42:44.329 --> 03:42:47.149]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
