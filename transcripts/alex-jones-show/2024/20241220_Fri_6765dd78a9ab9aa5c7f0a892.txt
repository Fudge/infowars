[00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.839]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.679]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:20.920]  And a tweet changed all of it?
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:29.780]  Can you imagine what the next two years are gonna be like if every time The Congress works its will and then there's a tweet?
[00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:39.579]  Or from an individual who has no official portfolio, who threatens members on the Republican side with a primary, and they succumb?
[00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:48.420]  This institution has a separate responsibility based upon the separation of powers.
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.219]  Members of Congress don't serve under presidents of the United States.
[00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:54.079]  It's Friday.
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:26.379]  December 20th, 2024. The clip you just saw is Congressman Richard Neal, a Democrat, panicking and just apoplectic, talking about the fact that while Elon Musk and other people have sway with the population and X is allowing the population to come together and lobby their representatives to The continuing resolution
[00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:34.500]  spending bill two days ago, and we just can't allow them to put pressure on Republican lawmakers to do the right thing.
[00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.500]  That's how free open societies are supposed to work.
[00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:50.560]  That's how the United States of America's constitutional republic is supposed to operate, the apple of the world's eye, the model in the last 200 plus years for the rest of the world to emulate, to have a free society.
[00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:54.200]  And they're saying, we can't allow this.
[00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.180]  We can't do this.
[00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.640]  I mean, what was in that bill?
[00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:07.980]  Total medical tyranny, new quarantines, masks, martial law level powers, everything they couldn't get passed in the UN treaty?
[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.900]  And then you've got AFD with the majority of the votes in Germany in the last election.
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.900]  And the current government says we're not recognizing that.
[00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:19.159]  We'll cover that in a moment.
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.979]  And then you've got Keira Starmer in the UK blocking new elections because he knows his party's about to be voted out.
[00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:30.419]  You've got Trudeau's own party saying they'll remove him in the new year if he doesn't resign.
[00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.599]  It's happening all over the world.
[00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:43.189]  But in places in Europe, Where countries like Romania are saying, we're anti-war, we're anti-globalists.
[00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:50.210]  NATO came in two weeks ago and said, fine, we're just disregarding your election and we control your intelligence agency.
[00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:55.009]  And so now we're just saying your election doesn't count.
[00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.509]  So the tyrants are really moving against humanity right now.
[00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.050]  But let's watch this clip of the Congressman one more time.
[00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:09.060]  Can you imagine what the next two years are going to be like if every time The Congress works its will and then there's a tweet.
[00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:25.800]  And what Congressman Neal just said is the standard statements, not just here in America, but by the communist politicians in control of Germany, by the globalist communist WF puppets up in Canada,
[00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:29.500]  the UK, Ireland, everywhere.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.219]  They're all just, we can't allow Elon Musk and the population to do this.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.379]  And Elon Musk just came out and endorsed AFD in Germany and said, you know, they're the real government.
[00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:46.539]  So you cannot stress enough the incredible job that Musk is doing, what a game changer is.
[00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.819]  Some people say, well, why do you gush over Musk?
[00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.099]  I mean, without him, we wouldn't have got Trump in.
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:04:01.479]  And he just continues all over the world, in Latin America, in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, in Eastern Europe, everywhere, to expose the new world order agenda.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:11.560]  And he put out a post on Xtoday just explaining that it's about giving the population a place to congregate and organize and unify for populist vision and ideas.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.500]  We're going to go to break in a minute.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.459]  I'm going to come back with more on this global revolution that's happening.
[00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:19.060]  It's so exciting.
[00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:24.120]  The globalist system really is in free fall collapse right now, but that's why they're so dangerous.
[00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:27.779]  And that's why more attack of missiles rained down inside Russia today.
[00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.029]  And so, yeah, we're winning, but the bad guys are launching a new pandemic.
[00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.470]  They got big, nasty plans once Trump gets in for civil unrest.
[00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.730]  We'll lay it all out straight ahead because exposing their agenda is what will stop them.
[00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:49.589]  That's why they admit in their own white papers and statements, the deep state, that they want me off the air because we are breaking down their plans and their operations and their dirty tricks.
[00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.329]  Stay with us.
[00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.730]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.629]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:16.550]  It's Friday, December 20th, 2024. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:20.009]  The globalists are losing on every front.
[00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:38.800]  Every one of their different policy initiatives is running into massive We are seeing anti-globalist, pro-freedom, pro-capitalist, pro-Western national sovereign parties surging and winning all over the world.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.680]  We have Elon Musk coming out and endorsing AFD in Germany that's been winning the elections and should now be in charge of the Bundestag and the parliament.
[00:05:48.079 --> 00:06:03.139]  But the other parties have gotten together and say, we're just disregarding you, and they're trying to now ban the The AFD. And then if you look at what's happening in the UK, Kerry Starmer is talking about canceling an upcoming election because his party's got less than 20% approval ratings.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.759]  He's got about a 15% approval rating.
[00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:27.029]  Obviously, the main party up in control of Canada with Trudeau is now calling for him to resign, saying he will be removed early in the new year if he doesn't because the public is absolutely pissed and awakening to Trudeau's WEF We're good to go.
[00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:46.810]  Patriots are getting elected, and that's why we see politicians and different globalist puppets from Australia to the U.S. say, we can't allow this, and we can't allow the people to be organizing and saying no and shooting down our legislation.
[00:06:46.810 --> 00:07:00.170]  I mean, why, we just had this big pandemic legislation in the continuing resolution spending bill, and Elon Musk and the public got mad about it and stopped it by threatening to primary the Republicans that were going to go along with it.
[00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.589]  Yes, the people are exercising their power.
[00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.709]  We don't want medical tyranny.
[00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.069]  We don't want all this globalism.
[00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:10.649]  And now, NATO has started bombing Russia with the TACIMs again.
[00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:16.569]  You're watching footage from earlier today in Rilsk, Kursk.
[00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:22.930]  The city was bombed by NATO. U.S. made TACIM missiles.
[00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:26.110]  Reportedly, other missiles slammed into other areas.
[00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:35.329]  This is a serious escalation with only 31 days left until Trump is in office.
[00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:41.470]  You've got Biden arriving via Marine One yesterday, even unable to speak.
[00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:46.949]  Harris running back from vacation in California to the White House.
[00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:48.269]  They're in total disarray.
[00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.709]  They're trying to launch a new pandemic.
[00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:56.980]  Announcing a bird flu emergency in California to try to get political control of the people's minds.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:04.040]  They're accelerating open World War III and the danger of nuclear war with Russia.
[00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:15.259]  And again, as soon as President Trump gets back into office, the Democrats have announced they're going to try to trigger race-based civil unrest as some pretext to drive him from office.
[00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:16.680]  This is all official.
[00:08:16.939 --> 00:08:19.000]  These are the crises they're cooking up.
[00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:23.170]  We're good to go.
[00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:36.490]  Exciting time.
[00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:49.929]  And the InfoWars viewers and listeners, the activists, you are recognized by the bad guys as the tip of the spear, as the main focal point, getting the truth out that then becomes the talking points for everybody else, including Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and others.
[00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.490]  So get this report out.
[00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.169]  Owen Troyer is about to take over.
[00:08:53.309 --> 00:08:53.889]  Live transmission.
[00:08:54.049 --> 00:08:56.870]  I'll be back with more coming up in a little while.
[00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:01.549]  Please stay with us and share the live feed to the show right now at Relox Jones on X because you are the Paul Revere's.
[00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:02.169]  You are the resistance.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live inside the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:15.139]  It's Friday, December 20th, 20-24.
[00:09:15.299 --> 00:09:16.899]  Owen Troyer sitting in for Alex today.
[00:09:17.299 --> 00:09:21.639]  He will be sending reports in from the road, but...
[00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:29.629]  We have major developments going down in D.C. right now, at the Capitol right now.
[00:09:29.809 --> 00:09:38.389]  There was supposed to be a vote hours ago on a new bill, continued resolution bill, didn't happen.
[00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:52.389]  So I'm going to give you the update on everything that's going on, and then I'll tell you the most likely outcome as we are just hours away from From a government shutdown.
[00:09:54.690 --> 00:10:02.110]  The original bill, 1500 pages plus, was basically a Democrat bill.
[00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.769]  It was a Democrat sponsored and written bill.
[00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:07.809]  Deep state, big government bill.
[00:10:09.129 --> 00:10:13.029]  Mike Johnson decided that was the bill he was going to roll with.
[00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.850]  It was so bad...
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:26.940]  He couldn't even bring it to the floor for a vote because of all the outcry, not just from we the people but from Republicans in the House as well.
[00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:33.240]  Chuck Schumer is now suggesting we go back to that bill.
[00:10:33.379 --> 00:10:38.960]  So if you had any doubt that that was a Democrat bill, remove that doubt.
[00:10:39.379 --> 00:10:42.720]  And I'll show you what Chuck Schumer had to say coming up here shortly.
[00:10:44.559 --> 00:11:00.659]  You then had Johnson circle the wagons, forced to present a second bill for a vote last night that was still over 100 pages, but removed a lot of the agenda items,
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.360]  like the global...
[00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:13.309]  Tyranny for pandemics, the medical tyranny, the censorship operations, the protection for the January 6th committee criminals.
[00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.929]  A lot of the political agenda items were removed.
[00:11:16.129 --> 00:11:20.110]  A lot of the spending items remain the same, virtually the same.
[00:11:20.669 --> 00:11:25.990]  And then it increased the debt limit, which is something Donald Trump is requesting.
[00:11:27.909 --> 00:11:30.029]  And we'll explain that.
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.320]  When we tell you what's about to happen today.
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:42.059]  Well, that bill failed on the floor last night with more than 30, the number is 38, Republicans voting against it.
[00:11:42.139 --> 00:11:49.720]  And of course all the Democrats voting against it as well because they were hoping that we could go back to their original bill with all their political items in it.
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:56.379]  The censorship, the medical tyranny, the protection of the January 6th committee criminals and more.
[00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:03.210]  Which they want to go back to again today, but that's not going to happen.
[00:12:04.769 --> 00:12:20.789]  Now, behind the scenes, the Freedom Caucus had a third bill that was 22 pages long and was as clean as it gets with a continued resolution and then funding the Farm Act,
[00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.750]  the disaster relief for the hurricane victims, and the military.
[00:12:26.649 --> 00:12:27.850]  22 pages.
[00:12:28.909 --> 00:12:30.029]  Never made it to the floor.
[00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:32.049]  Johnson wasn't interested in it.
[00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.149]  Was questionable whether it would get the votes or not.
[00:12:36.289 --> 00:12:38.070]  It didn't have the votes on the Republican side.
[00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.169]  They were going to be a couple short on the Republican side.
[00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.789]  They might have been able to get a couple Democrats to vote for it.
[00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:43.529]  That's kind of unknown.
[00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.990]  The Democrats are moving in unity right now, unlike the Republicans.
[00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:56.710]  But that's simply because they have an agenda to get that original bill passed with all of their political items, political agendas inside of it.
[00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:13.549]  The fact that we haven't had a vote or a bill presented yet tells me that the situation with Speaker Johnson is so bad, he has virtually no command over the House Republicans whatsoever.
[00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.950]  Now, there's been a lot of chatter back and forth.
[00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:23.850]  The Trump supporters...
[00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:33.330]  The populists have had a bit of a split, a bit of a chasm last night because Trump endorsed this bill.
[00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.389]  A lot of people wanted that bill last night to pass.
[00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:41.350]  And now they're upset with the 38 Republicans that voted against it.
[00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:43.950]  Well, here's the truth.
[00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.730]  That bill was not physically conservative.
[00:13:51.549 --> 00:13:57.440]  And as a precedent, I think it was the right thing to vote against it.
[00:13:58.299 --> 00:14:09.259]  Now, I've heard both sides from Republicans that I think are good and conservatives and pro-America, pro-Trump, not corrupt, saying why they should support it or why they shouldn't.
[00:14:09.259 --> 00:14:17.620]  And now everybody's going back in time and looking at things these Republicans have said past about George Floyd or Donald Trump or Steve Bannon.
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.639]  And so I get that.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.980]  And now it's turned into this game of political whack-a-mole instead of dealing with the real issue.
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.840]  And this is the real issue.
[00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:31.259]  We need single issue, single page bills.
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:32.659]  Period.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.179]  We need to embrace a government shutdown.
[00:14:41.059 --> 00:14:42.600]  And I find it ironic.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:47.539]  The same people that are promoting Doge as a concept...
[00:14:50.149 --> 00:15:04.289]  With Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk, who have proposed cutting up to 75% of the federal government, are complaining that 17% of the government might close if this bill doesn't pass.
[00:15:04.409 --> 00:15:05.669]  I just don't get that.
[00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:10.590]  If you're serious about Doge, then you should be okay with this government shutdown.
[00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.330]  Might be a nice little test run.
[00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.970]  Now, there are political implications here if the government shuts down.
[00:15:21.049 --> 00:15:31.509]  One being, and this could go both ways, but one being, okay, well, does this limit what Joe Biden can do in his final days of office?
[00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:32.289]  It just might.
[00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:49.450]  And then what happens on January 3rd when the new Congress shows up and they have to vote for a new speaker and they have to get new agenda items passed?
[00:15:50.669 --> 00:15:51.789]  What happens then?
[00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.129]  It's a very peculiar situation.
[00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:56.669]  I think it's a good thing.
[00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:57.730]  We should have a reset.
[00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:02.649]  There shouldn't be anything that happens before Donald Trump takes office or the new Congress takes office.
[00:16:03.649 --> 00:16:04.769]  Why would we want that?
[00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:10.909]  And the issue with the disaster relief obviously is a real issue.
[00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:12.970]  But how are we going to sit here...
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:19.440]  And talk about, oh, and finger wag and finger point about not funding disaster relief.
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.460]  This is something that should have been done months ago.
[00:16:22.779 --> 00:16:25.200]  This is something that shouldn't even be an issue.
[00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:34.679]  But it is because members of this Congress, including Republicans, voted to give money to illegal immigrants.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.139]  Where is all the complaining about that?
[00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:48.840]  So we'll go back in time and look at tweets and statements from four years ago about things Republicans said that voted against this bill to smear mud on their face.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:17:09.019]  But what about the fact that just months ago, and even over the course of the last two years with this Congress, those same Republicans and the ones that voted to the bill to support the bill last night, Have voted to give federal money to illegal immigrants.
[00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:13.660]  And now you're going to complain because there's no disaster relief aid?
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.140]  No.
[00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:17.240]  That is a problem from years ago.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.380]  That is a problem from months ago.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.180]  That is a problem right up to the White House.
[00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:50.369]  So yeah, it's really tragic that now we have to sit here and use the Christmas break and the government shutdown and a continued resolution and we are holding hostage Americans that are living in tents in North Carolina because our government is so sick and depraved that they refused to have emergency relief for Americans and instead sent hundreds of billions of dollars to illegal immigrants.
[00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:51.910]  Let's just get that straight.
[00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:54.670]  That's your real issue here.
[00:18:00.369 --> 00:18:02.170]  There will likely be a government shutdown.
[00:18:04.769 --> 00:18:11.589]  And the strategy for Mike Johnson is really just completely non-existent at this point.
[00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.069]  And it shows me that he really doesn't want to win.
[00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.609]  He wants the swamp to win.
[00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.250]  There's a very simple path to victory here.
[00:18:19.509 --> 00:18:20.250]  Very simple.
[00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:24.119]  And I understand why Trump wants to increase the deficit.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.279]  He wants to increase his spending limit.
[00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:29.400]  And he wants to do it now before he becomes president.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.559]  But if you're going to be cutting all these...
[00:18:33.999 --> 00:18:37.160]  Federal programs and spending, then you're going to have more cap room anyway.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.619]  So I don't really see it as that big of an issue.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:45.839]  Plus, you're still going to control the House and the Senate when the next congressional session starts.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.359]  So I don't really think it's that big of an issue now.
[00:18:48.839 --> 00:18:51.680]  And if you're a fiscal conservative, you really don't want it anyway.
[00:18:53.539 --> 00:18:54.559]  But put that aside.
[00:18:55.059 --> 00:18:59.539]  There's a very clear strategy for Mike Johnson to have a victory here.
[00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:05.490]  You propose as many as you want.
[00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:09.069]  If you want it to be two, three, four, five, whatever, as many as you want.
[00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:12.509]  Single-issue bills.
[00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:14.990]  Single-page, single-issue bills.
[00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:19.970]  And you have one for federal disaster relief for the hurricane.
[00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:23.650]  Same fund from the original bills that have failed.
[00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.750]  You put a Farm Act bill out there.
[00:19:28.089 --> 00:19:28.609]  Same fund.
[00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.950]  Same agenda that you had in the last two bills.
[00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:40.450]  And then if you need some military stuff or some other things, single issue, single page bills.
[00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:43.369]  And then here's what you'll have.
[00:19:46.289 --> 00:20:03.220]  Either the Democrats will be forced to vote against Hurricane Relief, against the Farm Act, and then whatever other items you want to put out there, Or you can actually get the disaster relief,
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:10.359]  get the Farm Act passed, get the things that need to be passed, passed, and then government shut down, government doesn't shut down.
[00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:11.900]  Who cares?
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.660]  I like the government shutdown.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.920]  Some do, some don't.
[00:20:16.059 --> 00:20:17.019]  You can have it out over that.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.460]  But if you actually want to have a political victory, that's what you would do.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.980]  And you should be able to pass those things with the Republican Party.
[00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:29.460]  And if he can't do that...
[00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:31.630]  Then he's even worse than we think.
[00:20:32.769 --> 00:20:36.730]  But there are no indications he's going to do that at this current time.
[00:20:39.589 --> 00:20:41.210]  So imagine how sick that is.
[00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.609]  You could do that right now.
[00:20:44.569 --> 00:20:50.809]  You could propose a bill right now for disaster relief for hurricane victims.
[00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:53.670]  It could be one sentence, two sentences, three sentences.
[00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.730]  One page, one bill, put it on the floor and get the votes.
[00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:01.359]  But they're not going to do that.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.839]  Johnson's not going to do that.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:18.240]  Because he, like the politicians we've been dealing with forever, would rather hold those hurricane victims hostage in a tent to try to get the rest of their agenda items passed.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.559]  The rest of their spending items passed.
[00:21:23.779 --> 00:21:25.940]  That's how sick our Congress is.
[00:21:26.019 --> 00:21:28.079]  That's how sick our politicians are.
[00:21:31.049 --> 00:21:41.789]  And just because you don't like somebody in the Republican Party and just because they've said things and done things that might be completely despicable in the past politically, sometimes they can still be right.
[00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:51.670]  So I get people don't like Chip Roy for things he's done and now Trump's against Chip Roy and people don't like Nancy Mace for things she's done and now there's a whole attack on Nancy Mace.
[00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:54.650]  Fine.
[00:21:56.289 --> 00:21:57.990]  But that doesn't mean they're not right here.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.079]  And by the way, now Trump is basically saying just go ahead and shut it down.
[00:22:03.559 --> 00:22:04.779]  So even Trump is caved.
[00:22:08.839 --> 00:22:18.599]  Mike Johnson needs to go as speaker and failing at this juncture is going to be the thing that does it if he's not already out.
[00:22:20.859 --> 00:22:25.779]  U.S. Speaker Mike Johnson's future hangs in balance as he scrambles for funding deal.
[00:22:26.619 --> 00:22:27.519]  What are you going to do?
[00:22:28.099 --> 00:22:35.619]  You're going to Pose another couple hundred pages of legislation that nobody's read and then send it to the floor for a vote.
[00:22:35.819 --> 00:22:44.019]  People are going to vote on a bill they've never even read, which is just in complete violation of the 72-hour rule.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.099]  Just give me a bill.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:46.819]  I'll vote for it.
[00:22:48.099 --> 00:22:49.099]  Didn't even read it.
[00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:53.160]  Mike Johnson signals Plan C reached to avert shutdown Friday.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.880]  That's what he was telling the press this morning.
[00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:55.799]  No vote.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.380]  No bill.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:06.859]  No Plan C. And he won't even take the 22-page continued resolution bill that came out of the Freedom Caucus.
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.940]  He won't even take that bill to the floor because he knows the Democrats won't vote for it.
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.880]  You might be able to get the votes from the Republicans on that bill.
[00:23:17.019 --> 00:23:17.420]  You might.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:23.160]  You're going to have to do some negotiating, but you could get the votes from the Republicans on that bill.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.279]  You won't get a vote from a Democrat.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.640]  So good, so bring it to the floor and let him vote no.
[00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:36.549]  Shutdown looms as Johnson to roll out very similar spending package for Friday vote.
[00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:37.690]  Still haven't seen it.
[00:23:38.369 --> 00:23:43.130]  Senate Republicans fume over dysfunctional House amid shutdown fight.
[00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:44.809]  Tells ya.
[00:23:47.309 --> 00:23:48.309]  Johnson's cooked.
[00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:52.150]  Johnson's cooked.
[00:23:52.849 --> 00:23:56.210]  Rand Paul suggests Elon Musk as House Speaker.
[00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.109]  Vivek Ramaswamy's name has been kicked around as well.
[00:24:01.359 --> 00:24:02.700]  More commentary from the Senate.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.240]  Mike Lee.
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.299]  Here's an idea.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:19.059]  Well, that's a direct shot at Mike Johnson.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:19.839]  But it's true.
[00:24:22.759 --> 00:24:23.500]  It's true.
[00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:30.609]  And look, normally they just vote for this stuff and it just passes and we just go about our business.
[00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:31.529]  Not today.
[00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:32.349]  Not anymore.
[00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:36.190]  See, we the people actually get a say in all of this, don't we?
[00:24:37.869 --> 00:24:39.769]  Of course, this has Democrats fuming.
[00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.369]  Some Republicans fuming too.
[00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:44.170]  Like Dan Crenshaw.
[00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:49.430]  He's just gone into complete psychotic tirades the last 48 hours.
[00:24:49.589 --> 00:24:50.710]  He's just completely lost it.
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:54.859]  Let's call their bluff.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.480]  Democrats pledge to work through Christmas on funding to rebuff Trump's demands.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.140]  No, they won't.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.519]  No, they won't.
[00:25:04.019 --> 00:25:04.519]  Please.
[00:25:06.579 --> 00:25:08.660]  Call their bluff.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.400]  Shut it down.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.059]  By the way, they want the shutdown too because they want to blame the Republicans.
[00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:17.559]  Thomas Massey says this isn't complicated.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.880]  Separate bills and vote on them individually.
[00:25:21.259 --> 00:25:21.680]  That's right.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.440]  It's not complicated.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.180]  It's common sense.
[00:25:23.299 --> 00:25:24.359]  It's what the American people want.
[00:25:25.099 --> 00:25:28.000]  One vote on the clean CR. One vote on the debt limit.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.619]  One vote on disaster relief.
[00:25:29.819 --> 00:25:31.240]  One vote on farm bailouts.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.900]  Individual bills for each issue.
[00:25:34.519 --> 00:25:36.519]  That's 100%.
[00:25:36.519 --> 00:25:37.920]  Who wouldn't agree with that?
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.019]  Well, apparently not Mike Johnson.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.980]  He could do that right now.
[00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:46.000]  And he would get the votes from the Republicans.
[00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:57.759]  At least on disaster relief, farm bailouts, debt limit and the CR, there might be negotiating that needs to go down on that, but he can get the disaster relief.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.019]  Make Democrats vote against it.
[00:25:59.099 --> 00:25:59.380]  Do it.
[00:26:00.279 --> 00:26:01.259]  What are you waiting on?
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.799]  No, you stand to reason.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.880]  Mike Johnson is actually working for the Democrats here.
[00:26:10.039 --> 00:26:12.400]  And that's probably why Chuck Schumer...
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.940]  Said this on the floor this morning in clip eight.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.319]  Wonderful.
[00:26:29.619 --> 00:26:30.980]  Nothing like a little tech glitch.
[00:26:31.859 --> 00:26:32.339]  Oh.
[00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:37.319]  It's time to go back to the original agreement we had just a few days ago.
[00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:54.210]  It's time the House votes on our bipartisan CR. It's the quickest, simplest, and easiest way we can make sure the government stays open while delivering critical emergency aid to the American people.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.359]  And that's the other reminder here.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:05.619]  So that dirtbag, that absolute dirty, rotten, scoundrel rat, probably the biggest rat that's ever been seen in D.C. There's some big rats in D.C. You ever seen them?
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.779]  They crawl out of dumpsters and trash cans, scurry around.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.680]  Schumer walks around the Capitol.
[00:27:09.779 --> 00:27:10.680]  He's the biggest rat ever.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:17.980]  And that rat is demanding we go back to the first original 1,500-page bill because it's the Democrat bill.
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:24.440]  It has all the Democrat agenda items in there, things that they probably would like to use before Trump even gets into office.
[00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:35.990]  The pandemic, medical tyranny, spying on American citizens, protection of the January 6th committee criminals.
[00:27:37.309 --> 00:27:39.529]  We've got more coming up on this issue.
[00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:40.910]  We'll be paying attention.
[00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:44.190]  Shut it down!
[00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:05.890]  The Musk Johnson proposal is not serious.
[00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:07.430]  It's laughable.
[00:28:08.369 --> 00:28:12.250]  Extreme MAGA Republicans are driving us to a government shutdown.
[00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:16.089]  Do you see a world in which you might regret not agreeing with a clean debt ceiling?
[00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.630]  That's Hakeem Jeffries speaking to the media.
[00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.210]  And they have these signs that they're taking to the floor.
[00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:30.190]  During the speaking times, it's a hashtag Republican shutdown.
[00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:33.329]  And it's so easy.
[00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:34.630]  It's not even that complicated.
[00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:38.869]  You don't have to be a political genius to understand how to defeat that narrative.
[00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:44.809]  Bring forth the single-issue bills and make the Democrats vote against them.
[00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:52.519]  Bring forth the CR, disaster relief, the farm bill, And make Democrats vote against him.
[00:28:52.619 --> 00:28:54.279]  And then how are they going to say it's a Republican shutdown?
[00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:58.019]  But you should embrace the shutdown.
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.039]  The Republicans should embrace the shutdown.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.519]  They should say, yes, we're serious.
[00:29:04.019 --> 00:29:05.500]  We're serious about Doge.
[00:29:06.019 --> 00:29:07.460]  We think the government's corrupt.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.160]  It has a very low approval rating from the American people.
[00:29:10.279 --> 00:29:10.920]  It's out of control.
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:11.680]  It's overspending.
[00:29:11.799 --> 00:29:12.099]  It's corrupt.
[00:29:12.259 --> 00:29:14.079]  So, yeah, let's go ahead and shut down the government.
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:15.759]  And by the way...
[00:29:16.819 --> 00:29:24.279]  When do we see debates like this when we send hundreds of billions of dollars in money to Ukraine?
[00:29:24.519 --> 00:29:26.299]  You notice how that's never a problem?
[00:29:27.119 --> 00:29:30.279]  We can send billions of dollars to foreign countries.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.880]  We can send hundreds of billions of dollars to foreign countries.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.160]  Foreign wars.
[00:29:35.339 --> 00:29:36.420]  No big debate.
[00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:37.599]  No big struggle session.
[00:29:39.299 --> 00:29:41.420]  No big finger-pointing, finger-waving.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.400]  Oh no, that money just...
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.059]  Oh yeah, easy.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.019]  Oh, foreign country?
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:45.619]  Foreign war?
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:46.920]  Send it away.
[00:29:48.039 --> 00:29:49.920]  But Americans need disaster relief.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.680]  Farmers need to bail out all this stuff.
[00:29:51.759 --> 00:29:52.579]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.299]  We gotta...
[00:29:53.299 --> 00:29:54.519]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:29:54.599 --> 00:29:55.240]  Hold your horses.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.420]  We gotta have a big debate here.
[00:29:56.519 --> 00:29:58.740]  We gotta have a big congressional circus here.
[00:30:02.079 --> 00:30:03.039]  So here's the latest.
[00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:26.450]  There were multiple new bills proposed, one very similar to yesterday's bill that failed at the floor, and then the Freedom Caucus bill that was 22 pages that had everything in it, very clean, very simple, that was questionable whether it could have the votes, but it was a very small amount of Republicans they would have to switch over to get to vote for it for that to pass.
[00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:31.289]  I'm told neither of these bills has the vote as of right now.
[00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:35.829]  And that's why there hasn't been a vote yet and nobody's gone to the floor.
[00:30:38.049 --> 00:30:45.910]  So, what's being worked on right now are single-issue bills, and it might be the four that Thomas Massey talked about.
[00:30:46.569 --> 00:30:50.710]  A clean CR, a debt limit, disaster relief, and farm bailouts.
[00:30:50.829 --> 00:30:52.589]  So, it's pretty simple here.
[00:30:52.609 --> 00:30:58.829]  You get the CR, and then the continued resolution, see who votes for it, see who doesn't, okay.
[00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:00.309]  Then you get...
[00:31:01.069 --> 00:31:04.849]  The debt limit, which was in the original bill, but not what Trump wanted.
[00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.150]  Trump put the new debt limit in the new bill because he wants a higher debt limit.
[00:31:09.109 --> 00:31:11.109]  So put that out there, see if it works.
[00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:15.029]  That probably is the smallest chance of passing, but go ahead and put it out there.
[00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:21.890]  And then if Trump wants to use it politically to decide who's with him and who's not, whatever, fine, put it out there.
[00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:25.950]  And then the disaster relief bill and the farm bill.
[00:31:27.259 --> 00:31:28.059]  Single bills.
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:28.940]  Single page.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:29.599]  Get it done.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.940]  Now apparently that's what's being worked on right now.
[00:31:32.119 --> 00:31:37.880]  The problem is the vote would not be able to happen until tomorrow because of the rules.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:46.839]  So the bills that they've already had in the works could be brought to the floor today, but they can't get the votes.
[00:31:47.849 --> 00:31:49.549]  There are holdouts in the Freedom Caucus.
[00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:51.250]  There are holdouts in the Republican Party.
[00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:53.069]  They cannot get the votes.
[00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:59.150]  So now, I guess trying to avoid embarrassment, Johnson doesn't even want to bother bringing him to the floor.
[00:31:59.349 --> 00:32:06.009]  The Democrat Party is voting in unison, so there's really no chance of getting any votes there.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:12.460]  And now they're apparently working on single-issue votes, but the problem is you can't vote on them until tomorrow.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:22.920]  Now there's another development here in that many members of Congress are threatening to leave at the end of the day today and start their Christmas vacation.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:32.819]  Now if that's the case, you would have to get Democrat votes to pass any of the bills.
[00:32:33.099 --> 00:32:35.819]  Because there will be Republicans that are threatening to go home.
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.960]  You will have to get Democrats.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.819]  Now, the Democrats already said, we'll stay, we'll work.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:48.900]  I don't believe them for one second.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:49.660]  I think they're bluffing.
[00:32:49.799 --> 00:32:55.339]  But you could floor single-issue bills and get a vote tomorrow.
[00:32:56.099 --> 00:32:57.559]  Republicans are already threatening to leave.
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:58.319]  They don't want to do that.
[00:32:59.559 --> 00:33:01.380]  So this is what's being negotiated.
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.980]  This is what's going back and forth right now on the Hill.
[00:33:05.099 --> 00:33:10.839]  But again, They never have a big standoff like this over hundreds of billions of dollars for Ukraine.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:16.519]  They never have a big standoff like this anytime Israel asks for a blank check.
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.960]  We never get anything like this.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.019]  It's only when it's the American people.
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:29.359]  It's only when the government's supposed to be functioning for us and our country's operations and infrastructure and disaster relief and farmers.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.519]  No, then there's a big debate.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.099]  Then there's a big standoff.
[00:33:34.319 --> 00:33:36.319]  But a foreign country, a foreign war needs it?
[00:33:36.519 --> 00:33:37.220]  Blank check.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:37.759]  What do you need?
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:38.259]  Anytime.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.000]  You got it.
[00:33:40.599 --> 00:33:41.880]  So I'm sick of it.
[00:33:42.599 --> 00:33:44.700]  And I think the American people are sick of it.
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.079]  So go ahead, shut it down.
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.779]  And all the hemming and hawing.
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.740]  Oh, but the hurricane victims.
[00:33:53.859 --> 00:33:58.579]  The hurricane victims got screwed and got raped by our government months ago.
[00:33:59.539 --> 00:34:07.480]  The hurricane victims got ignored by our government months ago and illegal immigrants were put at the front of the line.
[00:34:07.599 --> 00:34:17.559]  So don't give me this bullcrap of holding the country hostage because the people in North Carolina were abandoned months ago, years ago.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.320]  Same thing goes for the farmers.
[00:34:22.619 --> 00:34:23.480]  Hey, I don't like that.
[00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:32.940]  I'd rather the billions we spend on illegal immigrants, I'd rather the billions we spend on foreign countries and foreign wars and foreign citizens be spent on our farmers and our citizens that need disaster relief.
[00:34:33.099 --> 00:34:34.199]  Of course, who wouldn't?
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.079]  That's gone.
[00:34:35.079 --> 00:34:35.719]  That's over.
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:36.420]  We lost.
[00:34:38.119 --> 00:34:40.280]  They screwed that deal way long ago.
[00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:44.400]  Now we got a chance to make it right.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.280]  But it's not happening with this bill.
[00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:52.389]  It's not happening with this Congress.
[00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:54.210]  It's not happening with this White House.
[00:34:57.369 --> 00:34:59.570]  I got all these clips from the floor last night.
[00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:12.389]  But the Republicans need to get in unison with one thing, and that's pit the Democrats against the wall.
[00:35:14.789 --> 00:35:18.769]  If you don't want to own a government shutdown, which I don't understand, they don't...
[00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:20.869]  It's so stupid to me.
[00:35:21.469 --> 00:35:23.070]  It's not even a real government shutdown.
[00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:24.550]  It's like 17% of the government.
[00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:25.750]  Most people won't even know.
[00:35:25.849 --> 00:35:28.210]  99% of the population won't even notice a government shutdown.
[00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:33.750]  And, you know, to the people that will, I'm sorry.
[00:35:33.949 --> 00:35:35.989]  Your government is completely corrupt.
[00:35:35.989 --> 00:35:37.230]  It's a criminal government.
[00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:39.210]  So, yes.
[00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:47.389]  For those that might not get a paycheck or whatever it is, I'm sorry.
[00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:49.389]  You have a complete criminal government.
[00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:50.369]  We got a problem here.
[00:35:51.489 --> 00:35:52.050]  Sorry.
[00:35:52.409 --> 00:35:53.269]  Has to be done.
[00:35:55.769 --> 00:35:56.690]  Has to be done.
[00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:00.070]  But the Democrats melting down.
[00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:09.349]  I mean, you got Democrats going to the podium cross-dressing men.
[00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:14.150]  It's a dude in a purple wig dressed like a woman in a dress.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.400]  It's a clown show.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.860]  It's a complete and utter clown show.
[00:36:26.019 --> 00:36:31.380]  So the real process would be get the single issue bills to the floor.
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.380]  The Republicans that bail, those are the bad guys.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.699]  Not the ones that voted against the bill last night.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:42.460]  The ones that bail tomorrow and refuse to vote on single issue bills.
[00:36:44.149 --> 00:36:46.210]  Bills, they're the ones that need to be primaried.
[00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:51.510]  Because they refuse to do their job.
[00:36:58.889 --> 00:37:03.349]  And if you want to do this fight over who's responsible for the shutdown, then that's what you do.
[00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:04.489]  Which apparently they want to do.
[00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:14.190]  Here's J.D. Vance talking about it in clip 12. Mr. Vance, will you accept any deal that does not include a debt limit increase?
[00:37:14.369 --> 00:37:15.349]  Look, I'll say one thing.
[00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:28.829]  The Democrats just voted to shut down the government, even though we had a clean CR, because they didn't want to give the president negotiating leverage during the first year of his new term.
[00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:40.320]  And number two, because they would rather shut down the government and fight for global censorship bullshit They've asked for a shutdown and I think that's exactly what they're gonna get.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:50.000]  They're not gonna win with this current situation.
[00:37:51.469 --> 00:37:57.750]  If they want to win the argument on who's responsible for the government shutdown, then they have to present single issue bills and they have to show up.
[00:37:57.849 --> 00:37:58.789]  Otherwise, it's not going to work.
[00:37:58.929 --> 00:37:59.869]  Not that it even matters.
[00:37:59.969 --> 00:38:00.769]  Nobody even cares.
[00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:02.849]  The American people don't care.
[00:38:02.929 --> 00:38:07.869]  This whole government shutdown thing is this stupid little political game they play, this finger-pointing game they play.
[00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:09.389]  The American people don't care.
[00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:11.849]  You ask the average American, they probably want it shut down.
[00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:18.690]  Here's Senator Mike Lee saying that Speaker Johnson's time is...
[00:38:19.659 --> 00:38:21.380]  Basically up after this failure.
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:27.199]  Clip 13. Well, I don't think Johnson likes you now.
[00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:32.820]  Next time you guys see each other walking through the calls of Congress, he's gonna probably kick you in the leg.
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.460]  He is a good man.
[00:38:34.619 --> 00:38:35.199]  He's a friend.
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:35.960]  He's been a long...
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.219]  friend for a long time.
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.199]  Great person.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.559]  He's lost control of this process.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:40.880]  Okay.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:41.940]  And he's...
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:42.739]  this is...
[00:38:42.739 --> 00:38:44.619]  I don't know how he can remain in power.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.760]  We need Elon or Vivek as speaker.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.159]  He's a friend, and you just threw him overboard.
[00:38:49.389 --> 00:38:51.730]  Man, politics is tough, Senator Lee.
[00:38:51.949 --> 00:39:01.150]  Well, it is, especially when you try to jam an entire country with a 1,500-page bill that nobody's read, and you try to trick them and bully them into doing it.
[00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:02.769]  Some of us take that personally, Jesse.
[00:39:02.889 --> 00:39:03.849]  Yeah, no, I don't like it either.
[00:39:03.869 --> 00:39:07.929]  I think it's terrible, and we've got to stop doing it, and it's got to stop now.
[00:39:09.909 --> 00:39:10.809]  So there you go.
[00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:12.989]  Now, again, I've got these other clips.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:47.079]  From the process last night I'm going to put those on hold for now and I want to get to this big story out of the White House because it explains the larger issue of the Democrats in a way believing their own propaganda but now all piling on Joe Biden since it's public information but that he's falling apart but let's again just say this Mike Johnson is going to have a decision to make He
[00:39:47.079 --> 00:39:54.579]  knows as of 1145 Central, 1245 Eastern, they do not have a bill that can pass.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.119]  They do not have it.
[00:39:56.639 --> 00:39:59.340]  They've had two bills that wouldn't pass, one that failed last night.
[00:40:00.199 --> 00:40:02.659]  They made some adjustments to the one that failed last night.
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:03.659]  They don't have the votes.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:08.519]  There's a 22-page clean resolution bill with everything else in it from the Freedom Caucus.
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:10.099]  That doesn't have the votes.
[00:40:10.239 --> 00:40:11.860]  Now, you might be able to get that passed.
[00:40:13.559 --> 00:40:15.079]  But I don't think Johnson wants that bill.
[00:40:15.179 --> 00:40:16.699]  So he's not going to bring that one to the floor.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.460]  He's not even going to try to negotiate with that bill.
[00:40:18.639 --> 00:40:25.179]  But that's basically his last shot is that bill from the Freedom Caucus to not shut down the government.
[00:40:27.039 --> 00:40:33.579]  Because if they bring single-issue bills tomorrow, they will not have the votes either because nobody's going to be there.
[00:40:34.699 --> 00:40:38.860]  And unless you can convince the Democrats to vote for your bill, you're not going to have the votes.
[00:40:40.489 --> 00:41:00.929]  So I'd say at this point the government shutdown is inevitable and now you have to start looking at strategy dealing with the new Congress getting sworn in on January 3rd and really and they're not going to do the work Most of these members of Congress are lazy anyway.
[00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:02.510]  So they're not going to do the work.
[00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:14.369]  But what they should be doing now is getting ready to move at light speed starting on January 3rd when the new Congress comes in.
[00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:19.130]  And then you got January 6th, the certification of Trump's victory.
[00:41:19.309 --> 00:41:21.110]  And then you got January 20th, the inauguration.
[00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:30.420]  You basically need to move at light speed in that small window To actually get a bill passed.
[00:41:30.639 --> 00:41:35.760]  Or you can just say, we're going to keep the government shut down until Trump gets into office.
[00:41:38.199 --> 00:41:44.920]  But you better find a way, whoever the next speaker is, you better find a way to figure out who the next speaker is going to be.
[00:41:45.739 --> 00:41:51.019]  And then you need to find a way how to get Republicans to vote in unison like the Democrats are.
[00:41:53.099 --> 00:41:57.619]  Or this next administration is going to have problems.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.460]  But the truth is, this is how our government was designed.
[00:42:02.699 --> 00:42:03.780]  This is a good thing.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:04.880]  I enjoy this process.
[00:42:05.099 --> 00:42:07.139]  It shouldn't be easy to get things done in Congress.
[00:42:07.579 --> 00:42:23.719]  And it's been way too easy for them to screw us over for my entire life, give billions of dollars to foreign countries and foreign wars our entire lives, open the borders, fund that, fund everything else, fund all their agendas, fund NATO, fund the UN, all the other bullcrap.
[00:42:24.519 --> 00:42:25.719]  It's been way too easy.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.119]  Shut it all down.
[00:42:29.779 --> 00:42:36.440]  Literally, turn the power button off, take the cartridge out of the game, and just shut it down, just reset entirely.
[00:42:37.519 --> 00:42:40.559]  Let's great reset this corrupt government.
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:42.400]  Let's do that.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.539]  You don't need to increase your spending limit.
[00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:48.320]  You don't need to.
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:51.159]  You just need to cut your spending and then you'll have more cap room.
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:54.539]  And Trump knows that.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:05.559]  He just wanted to stick it to the Democrats, I think, with that spending limit deal as political leverage with the incoming administration.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.659]  But let's look at the current administration.
[00:43:08.739 --> 00:43:11.380]  Notice the silence from Joe Biden.
[00:43:11.559 --> 00:43:13.900]  Notice the silence from Kamala Harris.
[00:43:14.059 --> 00:43:16.960]  Now, Biden has been on and off a vacation the last couple days.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.659]  Harris has been on and off a vacation since she lost the election.
[00:43:22.019 --> 00:43:23.900]  And both of them have pretty much quit.
[00:43:25.409 --> 00:43:27.250]  I don't know who's running the White House.
[00:43:27.429 --> 00:43:29.329]  I don't know who's writing these pardons.
[00:43:30.849 --> 00:43:31.469]  Nobody knows.
[00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:34.230]  I don't know who's coming up with the policies right now.
[00:43:35.469 --> 00:43:37.349]  There is some policy coming out of the White House.
[00:43:37.449 --> 00:43:37.929]  We'll explain that.
[00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:43.889]  But the Wall Street Journal published this story, which is weird.
[00:43:43.889 --> 00:43:47.250]  It has such a big impact on D.C., but, you know, it's the Wall Street Journal.
[00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:52.030]  How the White House functioned with a diminished Biden in charge.
[00:43:52.369 --> 00:43:54.750]  Aides kept meeting short and controlled access.
[00:43:54.909 --> 00:43:59.190]  Top advisors acted as go-betweens and public interactions became more scripted.
[00:43:59.389 --> 00:44:02.190]  The administration denied Biden had declined.
[00:44:02.389 --> 00:44:08.070]  So it's insiders, it's whistleblowers, it's people that worked in the administration, it's members of Congress, it's all these people talking.
[00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:14.449]  Of course, they don't want you to know who they are in case political repercussions.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:33.139]  But you also had O'Keefe Media Group that had National Security Council and other people going on undercover camera saying, yeah, Biden is, quote, basically dead, can't talk, can't walk,
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:34.159]  doesn't run anything.
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.820]  I'm beginning to wonder if that's all, like, kind of fake.
[00:44:39.139 --> 00:44:47.219]  Like, these Biden administration insiders actually call O'Keefe Media Group and say, hey, do you want to catch me on a hidden camera?
[00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:50.590]  Like, I'll pretend I don't know it's there.
[00:44:50.750 --> 00:45:01.489]  Just, you know, send one of your undercover journalists over here and we'll go to dinner a couple times and I'll act like it's a normal dinner and I'll just kind of, like, spill the beans and spill the tea and I'll just pretend like it's undercover and I got caught.
[00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:03.250]  But really, I'll just give you all the information.
[00:45:03.869 --> 00:45:06.989]  Because, I mean, there's dozens of sources in this story.
[00:45:07.329 --> 00:45:12.949]  There's been multiple people that O'Keefe Media Group has caught on hidden camera talking about this stuff.
[00:45:15.909 --> 00:45:20.610]  But so that's what's frustrating is, oh, now it's in the Wall Street Journal and now it's real.
[00:45:20.789 --> 00:45:22.730]  And now everybody in D.C. is talking about it.
[00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:25.369]  Oh my gosh, Biden's been declining?
[00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:27.010]  Biden doesn't run anything?
[00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:28.690]  Oh my gosh, this is a disaster.
[00:45:31.389 --> 00:45:33.590]  This has been the case since day one.
[00:45:35.789 --> 00:45:37.329]  Everybody's known this since day one.
[00:45:37.429 --> 00:45:40.690]  But now it's the Wall Street Journal, so now it's real.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:50.739]  So who's writing all these pardons if Joe Biden doesn't even know where he is half the time?
[00:45:51.159 --> 00:45:56.159]  If Joe Biden is, quote, basically dead according to an NSC spy?
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:03.400]  Who's writing all of these policies?
[00:46:04.599 --> 00:46:10.699]  Feds look to hire up to 1,200 new DEI bureaucrats before Trump takes office.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:15.300]  They're just going to hire a salary up to $310,000.
[00:46:16.659 --> 00:46:21.880]  We're talking about hundreds of millions a year in DEI bureaucrats coming in.
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:26.539]  Biden announces cancellation of another $4 billion in student loans.
[00:46:26.679 --> 00:46:27.519]  Totally illegal.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.400]  Supreme Court ruled totally illegal, totally unconstitutional.
[00:46:30.719 --> 00:46:32.579]  Whose policy is that?
[00:46:32.699 --> 00:46:33.400]  Who's riding that?
[00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:39.710]  In a short interview, he sat down with a media outlet you've never heard of.
[00:46:39.789 --> 00:46:40.590]  Nobody's ever heard of him.
[00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:41.849]  Midas Touch.
[00:46:42.769 --> 00:46:44.869]  Just this left-wing hack group.
[00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:47.610]  Somebody forced Biden to go do an interview with them.
[00:46:47.809 --> 00:46:50.369]  They're trying to grow their profile ahead of the Trump administration.
[00:46:50.369 --> 00:46:51.429]  They have no audience.
[00:46:52.449 --> 00:46:54.010]  Nobody knows who Midas Touch is.
[00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:54.550]  Nobody cares.
[00:46:54.769 --> 00:46:59.949]  So they forced Biden to sit down and do this interview, hoping they could grow some notoriety, some profile.
[00:47:00.789 --> 00:47:02.690]  So they can attack Trump for the next four years.
[00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:04.090]  But it's an irrelevant group anyway.
[00:47:04.869 --> 00:47:06.050]  But, oh, they forced Biden.
[00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.989]  He looks old.
[00:47:06.989 --> 00:47:07.869]  He's confused.
[00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:10.230]  It's the worst he's ever looked.
[00:47:10.929 --> 00:47:15.230]  And he says, there's not a single thing he regrets about his disastrous presidency.
[00:47:15.469 --> 00:47:16.630]  Not a single thing he...
[00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:17.829]  Oh, yeah, not Afghanistan.
[00:47:19.389 --> 00:47:21.309]  The spy balloons, everything else.
[00:47:21.409 --> 00:47:23.349]  Oh, no, not a single thing.
[00:47:24.449 --> 00:47:26.070]  All the vacation time.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:32.179]  The Hunter Biden laptop isn't real, but I'm pardoning Hunter for all the things on his laptop.
[00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:41.150]  But now it's, oh, the secret's out in D.C. Biden wasn't running anything for the last four years.
[00:47:41.269 --> 00:47:43.309]  Biden didn't know what was going on for the last four years.
[00:47:43.409 --> 00:47:44.630]  It was a complete disaster.
[00:47:44.889 --> 00:47:46.090]  His aides were running everything.
[00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:47.210]  His staff was running everything.
[00:47:47.389 --> 00:47:53.570]  It was all the Obama holdovers and Obama that was running the White House the entire time, running policy, foreign policy, everything else.
[00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:56.050]  Oh, and the American media lied to the...
[00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:57.409]  Oh, they lied to you again.
[00:47:58.929 --> 00:48:00.989]  But it's the Washington Journal, see?
[00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:03.429]  Excuse me, it's the Wall Street Journal.
[00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:04.889]  So now it's real!
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:08.800]  Now it's real!
[00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:14.719]  It doesn't matter.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.260]  Everybody's known this for four years.
[00:48:16.719 --> 00:48:17.679]  It doesn't matter.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.559]  Biden has been clearly declining his entire administration.
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:28.239]  They ran a coup against him, yanked him out after his horrible debate performance.
[00:48:28.239 --> 00:48:28.900]  Oh no!
[00:48:29.219 --> 00:48:33.840]  It's the Wall Street Journal and now D.C. is freaking out!
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:41.300]  Former CNN pundit apologizes for ignoring Joe Biden's obvious mental decline.
[00:48:41.719 --> 00:48:44.739]  Oh, Chris Kaliza, he's sorry.
[00:48:45.059 --> 00:48:45.719]  Oh.
[00:48:47.719 --> 00:48:48.739]  No, no.
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:53.360]  You lied to the American people about Joe Biden since day one.
[00:48:54.179 --> 00:48:57.039]  And you said it was a conspiracy theory.
[00:48:58.269 --> 00:48:59.789]  You said he was sharp as a tack.
[00:48:59.789 --> 00:49:02.369]  You said his age was his advantage.
[00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:04.309]  You said he won the debate.
[00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:05.070]  Everything else.
[00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:06.550]  You've been lying since day one.
[00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:16.050]  But now, the Wall Street Journal with its inside sources and members of the intelligence community on undercover camera all saying Biden is declining.
[00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:17.530]  Biden's basically dead.
[00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:19.389]  They've been covering it up for four years.
[00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:20.570]  No, they haven't.
[00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:22.210]  You've just been lying to us.
[00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:23.530]  Everybody's seen it.
[00:49:25.639 --> 00:49:28.800]  And now people are wondering, why is Kamala Harris canceling her trip?
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.840]  Kamala Harris cancels California trip, goes to White House.
[00:49:35.019 --> 00:49:40.380]  She suddenly canceled her trip to Los Angeles to remain in D.C. after Biden declined bombshell.
[00:49:42.099 --> 00:49:44.139]  So is it in response to the story?
[00:49:44.539 --> 00:49:46.619]  Is something else going on?
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.400]  Yeah, well, the story is this.
[00:49:52.639 --> 00:49:54.719]  Joe Biden has been declining for four years.
[00:49:54.719 --> 00:49:56.280]  He hasn't been the president.
[00:49:56.679 --> 00:50:03.559]  And Kamala Harris is also done after she lost the election.
[00:50:04.159 --> 00:50:10.039]  So what you have is Chuck Schumer basically running things as far as the agenda is concerned.
[00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:19.289]  And then a bunch of Obama holdovers and staff members running the White House while Joe Biden is fumbling around, bumbling around.
[00:50:19.409 --> 00:50:20.329]  Nobody knows what's going on.
[00:50:20.409 --> 00:50:23.809]  The Bidens are running around, probably doing cocaine, selling the country out.
[00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:30.349]  But now, oh, now we can talk about it, now that he's on his way out.
[00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:34.570]  Well, what if you guys would have kept Biden in and then ran him and then gotten him elected again?
[00:50:35.969 --> 00:50:39.809]  Do you see how dangerous your lies are, your propaganda is?
[00:50:41.849 --> 00:50:43.610]  And that's what they do, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:44.269 --> 00:50:45.190]  That's what they do.
[00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:53.510]  And it's outlets like this being on air that are a huge threat to their propaganda and a huge threat to their operations.
[00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:55.389]  And that's why they want us shut down.
[00:50:55.530 --> 00:51:00.369]  And that's why in another undercover video you have these CIA contractors saying, oh yeah, we're going to shut Alex down.
[00:51:00.469 --> 00:51:01.190]  We're going to take his money.
[00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:03.610]  We're going to do everything we can to silence him and shut Infowars down.
[00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:03.969]  Oh yeah.
[00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:07.309]  We should have a congressional investigation into that.
[00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:19.309]  But your support has kept us on air this far, and your continued support will continue to keep Alex Jones on the air into the future at thealexjonesstore.com.

[00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:30.929]  There's Christmas sweaters for the Christmas season, Christmas ornaments and other decorations.

[00:52:13.769 --> 00:52:18.309]  You want to know how ridiculous this is, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:25.909]  You want to know how absolutely absurd it all is?
[00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:34.750]  Creen Jean Pierre had a press conference today.
[00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:41.269]  And I'm sure there will be plenty of interesting soundbites that come out of this press conference.
[00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:47.750]  But this one in particular will put it all into perspective.
[00:52:49.769 --> 00:53:03.210]  As we're sitting here debating about the continued resolution, debating about government spending, trying to get disaster relief, The Farm Bill, everything else.
[00:53:03.289 --> 00:53:11.710]  As all of this is going on, big debate over fiscal policy, fiscal conservatism, continued resolution, government spending, all this stuff.
[00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:13.610]  All this stuff.
[00:53:15.489 --> 00:53:19.650]  Listen to what the White House announced moments ago.
[00:53:20.119 --> 00:53:31.400]  As you all saw, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation announced a $1 billion financial initiative to support conservation of the Ecuadorian Amazon.
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:46.699]  This is a result of the President's recent trip to the Amazon and a continuation of the administration's effort to support innovative ways to address climate change through sustainable growth and development without burdening countries facing financial constraints.
[00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:51.989]  Would you like to hear that one more time?
[00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:52.969]  Did you catch that?
[00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:54.829]  Go ahead.
[00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:57.369]  Just in case you missed it.
[00:53:57.469 --> 00:53:58.070]  Go ahead, guys.
[00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.510]  Play it again.
[00:53:59.239 --> 00:54:11.599]  Earlier this week, as you all saw, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation announced a $1 billion financial initiative to support conservation of the Ecuadorian Amazon.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:26.920]  This is a result of the President's recent trip to the Amazon and a continuation of the administration's effort to support innovative ways to address climate change through sustainable growth and development without burdening countries facing financial constraints.
[00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:30.760]  How many buzzwords did you hear in that little explanation?
[00:54:31.179 --> 00:54:33.519]  Yeah, remember when Biden wandered off into the rainforest?
[00:54:34.099 --> 00:54:34.280]  Literally.
[00:54:36.059 --> 00:54:42.019]  A billion dollars for the Ecuadorian rainforest conservation project.
[00:54:43.239 --> 00:54:45.099]  Struggling countries.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:50.059]  Greenhouse gases, climate change, sustainable development.
[00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:52.820]  A billion dollars for the Ecuadorian Amazon.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:53.780]  Where do you think that's going?
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.199]  You think that's going to the Amazon?
[00:54:58.579 --> 00:54:59.559]  You're an idiot!
[00:55:00.099 --> 00:55:02.199]  That's called money laundering, baby!
[00:55:02.519 --> 00:55:03.780]  That's called theft!
[00:55:04.039 --> 00:55:06.320]  That's called fuck you, American people!
[00:55:06.539 --> 00:55:08.719]  I'm stealing your money on the way out!
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.840]  Is that that corrupt Brazilian president right there with him too?
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:14.960]  Unbelievable!
[00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:17.840]  Unbelievable!
[00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:38.860]  You can't even get disaster relief for Americans after Hurricane Helene and this Congress will hold them hostage so that you have to pass a bill That funds all the other agendas,
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:54.340]  the censorship, the global government, the medical tyranny, the protection of the D.C. criminals, all the other items, and they're holding American victims hostage, and then the White House goes out and says, oh, by the way, a billion dollars for Ecuador.
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:56.039]  Fuck you!
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:03.539]  And I'm supposed to feel guilty because I want the government shut down?
[00:56:04.889 --> 00:56:05.829]  Give me a break.
[00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:16.070]  All these people screaming and hemming and hawing about, oh, we need to give the disaster relief money, so you have to pass whatever bill we give you, even if you haven't read it.
[00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:23.769]  Even if it says you have to offer us your firstborn son and your firstborn daughter, you gotta pass it because of the hurricane victims.
[00:56:23.969 --> 00:56:26.469]  Give them the damn money you just gave to Ecuador!
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:28.559]  Fuck you!
[00:56:28.739 --> 00:56:29.739]  Shut it down!
[00:56:30.059 --> 00:56:31.719]  Shut it down now!
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:32.760]  Now!
[00:56:33.059 --> 00:56:33.400]  Now!
[00:56:33.679 --> 00:56:34.659]  I'm done!
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.119]  I'm done!
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:37.480]  No more money for Ukraine!
[00:56:37.639 --> 00:56:38.639]  No more money for Israel!
[00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:39.920]  No more money for Ecuador!
[00:56:40.159 --> 00:56:41.780]  No more money for any of these countries!
[00:56:42.079 --> 00:56:43.539]  Shut it down!
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:54.079]  How'd you like to be a guest on InfoWars after a rant like that?
[00:56:55.949 --> 00:56:59.050]  Well, one man will tell you the answer to that.
[00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:00.010]  That's Robert Newcomb.
[00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:00.909]  He's joining me now.
[00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:13.070]  We're going to be talking about this drone story, how it all ties into AI and the future of government policy with Doge.
[00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:23.179]  Foreign wars, foreign funding, it all ties in, but I guess, you know, it's the theme of the day here, Robert.
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:36.300]  Everybody talking about what's going on in Washington, D.C. And I just can't take anything this government does seriously, or the media, for that matter, that has been lying to us about Joe Biden for four years.
[00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:37.000]  Now they admit it.
[00:57:37.099 --> 00:57:38.039]  Oh, they just figured it out.
[00:57:38.119 --> 00:57:38.760]  They had no idea.
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:39.800]  Now they're admitting it.
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.059]  Okay, so you're either stupid or you're just lying.
[00:57:43.079 --> 00:57:43.840]  Probably both.
[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:59.340]  But when they come out and they just say, hey, billion dollars for Ecuador and the Amazon to fight climate change while they're holding victims hostage in North Carolina for disaster relief, I mean, how do the American people tolerate this stuff?
[00:57:59.599 --> 00:58:05.219]  I mean, they can't even, like, oh, we don't know whose drones they are and we don't have money for hurricane victims.
[00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:06.579]  I'm sick of this, man.
[00:58:06.719 --> 00:58:09.039]  I'm just, I'm so sick of the abuse we take.
[00:58:12.159 --> 00:58:12.820]  I completely agree.
[00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:16.460]  It's a dysfunctional government right now under the Biden administration.
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:26.519]  Just on top of the things that you just mentioned, you look at all the policy effects when it comes to a foreign policy perspective.
[00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:32.619]  And the disastrous Middle East, you know, the vacuum, the power vacuum that has occurred in Syria.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:38.579]  I mean, we can make a huge list as far as all the debauchery that has occurred over the last four years.
[00:58:39.519 --> 00:58:47.380]  And I'll just list one because I'm a veteran and the debacle that occurred in Afghanistan and pulling out of Afghanistan.
[00:58:47.619 --> 00:58:53.079]  So it's like a bad nightmare that's occurring in Syria and it's just going to happen again.
[00:58:53.539 --> 00:58:55.559]  We're lucky, you know, to have...
[00:58:55.599 --> 00:59:03.380]  This change in administration with Trump, just because, you know, of all the failures of the Biden administration.
[00:59:04.019 --> 00:59:07.280]  Well, and you've got quite a resume here, you know, an engineer.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:11.039]  You've gone through the Engineering Science and Development Program with the U.S. Navy.
[00:59:11.239 --> 00:59:13.699]  You've trained with the Department of Defense Weapons Systems.
[00:59:14.519 --> 00:59:19.380]  You're very well informed on AI and, of course, as well as drones.
[00:59:20.099 --> 00:59:24.159]  And I don't want to get off into some of these old stories, but, you know, you do bring that up.
[00:59:25.889 --> 00:59:30.530]  Obama basically gave American drone technology to Iran.
[00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:32.250]  They wanted to act like that was a mistake.
[00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:33.590]  I don't believe it for one second.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:38.480]  Bill Clinton sold nuclear secrets to the Chinese.
[00:59:39.019 --> 00:59:52.559]  And so we have this pattern of behavior of, hey, we're going to give U.S. intellectual property or even military technology to our foreign adversaries, but we're going to just count on the media not to report about it.
[00:59:53.019 --> 00:59:57.019]  And then they have these drones flying around, which we know that the government knows what's going on.
[00:59:57.119 --> 00:59:57.900]  They just won't tell us.
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:08.300]  But it's just like, at what point do the American people say, hey, wait a second, If this is an Iranian drone, which I don't believe for one second, you can comment on that too.
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.059]  Well, who gave them that technology?
[01:00:10.179 --> 01:00:11.139]  That was Barack Obama.
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:12.440]  He gave him that technology.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:17.800]  If there's an Iranian mothership off the coast flying drones, well, Obama gave him that technology.
[01:00:19.469 --> 01:00:34.769]  Right, and that's a good point, too, because you even look at how Xi Jinping came over to San Francisco, and Biden was right there inviting all these, you know, the open, Sam Altman and all these open AI,
[01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:38.170]  you know, techies to Frisco to meet Xi Jinping.
[01:00:38.949 --> 01:00:40.670]  And likely...
[01:00:40.929 --> 01:00:50.409]  There has been some transition or giving away of our technologies as far as AI goes to him.
[01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:51.449]  So yeah, absolutely.
[01:00:52.250 --> 01:01:03.219]  And of course, that's the next big technological boom is AI. You'd think Biden would want to keep America at the front of that, at the top of that, but I guess not.
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:04.860]  I guess it's, hey, whatever we're...
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:06.440]  I mean, they did the same thing with drones, too.
[01:01:06.739 --> 01:01:16.480]  Whatever technology we might have the edge in, let's just sacrifice that edge because we like to sell out this country and become rich, like the Biden crime family and the Clintons and so much more.
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.420]  Now, the drone story on the East Coast has kind of disappeared.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:21.900]  I mean, not literally.
[01:01:22.199 --> 01:01:26.420]  I don't know if there are still drones flying, but nobody's really talking about it.
[01:01:26.579 --> 01:01:32.000]  What is your synopsis of that with your experience in that field and just what you're seeing and what you're hearing?
[01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:46.130]  Yeah, so, you know, it's hard not to put your pulse on a PSYOP in this circumstance, just because of the way the narrative...
[01:01:48.519 --> 01:01:52.679]  You know, they said they didn't know, and then it might be UAPs, and they didn't know what adversary it was.
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:02:09.690]  And from, you know, a person that has spent so many years in the DOD developing what we call counter-UAS or other payloads or sensors that we put on Group 1, Group 2, which is the smaller drones, I just knew that that was not accurate.
[01:02:09.929 --> 01:02:11.789]  The DOD knows what's in our skies.
[01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:20.250]  We know, you know, what we call spectrum effects, which is how to sense drones in our skies, how to detect them.
[01:02:21.389 --> 01:02:32.630]  And so when it comes to the narrative, for sure, you know, to me, there's a level of speculation that comes just because of what we know, what kind of technology we have.
[01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:51.250]  As far as Congress goes, though, and the CR that they're trying to pass and the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act, they actually have a segment in there allocating, I think, roughly about $335 million to develop domestic or CONUS,
[01:02:51.329 --> 01:03:09.849]  continental U.S., technologies on a basis of There's an effort to do some collaboration with ARO, the ARO office within the DOD, and then also money towards doing collaborations with local police and law enforcement.
[01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:13.789]  So to me, from my perspective, I think this is a long time coming.
[01:03:14.530 --> 01:03:28.559]  When you look at threats and you look at From the perspective of the DOD, we look at threats, we do what's called risk mitigation, and we also do vulnerability assessments when it comes to our assets or our bases.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:41.920]  And from those perspectives, this is a much-needed effort in order to deter the civilian side of Or the domestic side of these threats.
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:52.099]  So certainly the conversation has changed since they've come out and kind of botched the narrative from the beginning.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:04:05.760]  But I'm glad to see that there's more legwork as far as implementing deterrences within CONUS, continental U.S. Robert Newcomb is my guest.
[01:04:06.619 --> 01:04:09.179]  DefendUT.com is the website.
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:13.340]  Let me talk technicals with you because you kind of bring this up.
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:25.360]  First of all, you know, there already is some rather basic laws and regulations on drones when you want to go buy a drone and just a consumer-level drone and fly it in the sky.
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.260]  There's some pretty basic regulations there.
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:35.610]  How much oversight or ability or knowledge in just a Minute-to-minute basis, let's say.
[01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:40.369]  Let's say 10 people go out in New Jersey with their consumer drones.
[01:04:40.429 --> 01:04:41.289]  They can go buy to Best Buy.
[01:04:41.429 --> 01:04:45.030]  Let's say 10 people go out, they put them in the air, they're filming or trying to do some stunts or whatever.
[01:04:45.429 --> 01:04:49.090]  I mean, does the FAA pretty much have that all under wraps?
[01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:53.409]  Like, okay, these are the drones that's up, they're up, bing, they've pinged, and then that's it?
[01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:57.690]  I mean, how much knowledge is there available just on an immediate basis?
[01:04:59.099 --> 01:05:00.340]  Yeah, there isn't.
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.380]  And that's for good reason in some respects.
[01:05:02.539 --> 01:05:10.599]  But the FAA, you know, follows and is supposed to be governing our domestic airspace.
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:14.300]  These drones, however, are supposed to be registered.
[01:05:14.559 --> 01:05:25.409]  And so when it comes to like a domestic, whether it's airports, From a domestic perspective, a lot of these drones are not picked up from the radar systems we have at our airports.
[01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:29.050]  And that, you know, we could get on the technical side of that.
[01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:40.650]  I don't think you want to, but it's basically they used what's called phased array a lot of times in the military to detect smaller And even decipher between like a drone and a bird.
[01:05:40.949 --> 01:05:53.550]  So the radar systems at airports are kind of aged and they'll pick up big passenger jets or even small like Cessnas and stuff, but they don't track in domestic airspace.
[01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:58.360]  They don't Unless it has a transponder, they don't track these smaller drones.
[01:05:58.639 --> 01:06:16.639]  And so that's part of the concern, especially when you look at the border, the open border that Biden has had, and all the terrorists, the known terrorists that have gotten caught and the gotaways, terrorists have had a knack for using drones to attack military bases.
[01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:17.559]  We see it in Ukraine.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.219]  We see it in the Middle East.
[01:06:21.599 --> 01:06:23.139]  You know, the threat is there.
[01:06:23.599 --> 01:06:36.639]  And to dismiss it or, you know, to ignore that all the threats and the terrorists that come over the border is, to me, it's close to incompetence or being inept.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:37.119]  So...
[01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:41.150]  Well, I would say you could even argue, in fact, no, I would argue that it's criminal.
[01:06:41.889 --> 01:06:43.969]  Mayorkas is a criminal, in my opinion.
[01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:46.489]  Maybe one of the biggest traitors in the history of this country.
[01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:52.949]  And that's why it's so offensive when they come out and say, well, we don't know whose drones they are, but we know it's not a threat.
[01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:58.010]  Well, okay, obviously you're lying because that's just completely illogical.
[01:06:58.679 --> 01:07:05.960]  But okay, a smaller consumer drone, you fly it in the air, maybe it doesn't register with the FAA or PING on any radar unless it's over protected airspace.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:12.239]  Now, what about the drones that we have been seeing on the East Coast that are military style?
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:16.519]  I mean, it appears to be drones that the Navy has purchased or has used in the past.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:22.340]  These drones that can change shape and move pretty fast, pretty agile in the air.
[01:07:23.099 --> 01:07:24.320]  Have worked with the Navy.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.920]  They're stationed off of the East Coast.
[01:07:27.119 --> 01:07:29.000]  Do drones like that ping?
[01:07:29.219 --> 01:07:30.420]  Or is it kind of the same situation?
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:35.139]  Unless it goes off in a protected airspace, they can pretty much fly around and not be on radar.
[01:07:36.679 --> 01:07:37.739]  Well, they could.
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:38.559]  They could ping.
[01:07:38.679 --> 01:07:39.900]  There's kind of a caveat there.
[01:07:40.079 --> 01:07:46.099]  When drones fly in the air, typically they give off signatures within the RF spectrum.
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:52.500]  Those signatures include radio frequencies, and they'll communicate with a ground controller.
[01:07:52.699 --> 01:08:00.480]  Now, for military and other advanced drones, we're getting into an area of autonomy and AI where...
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.760]  They're not going to give off a signature.
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.760]  So they're not going to be as detectable.
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:14.739]  And you couple that with materials, how radar detects drones in the air.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:23.960]  There's certain materials that can, stealth materials, that can deflect or absorb these radar frequencies.
[01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:43.449]  From a military perspective and from an advanced drone perspective, they're not necessarily going to be detectable from conventional radars that we deploy within the continental U.S. So if it was a spy drone,
[01:08:43.649 --> 01:08:49.869]  they wouldn't have their lights on and it wouldn't be detectable on radar because they'd obviously not want to be detected.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:52.140]  Right.
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:53.739]  And so that's part of the narrative.
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:09:00.460]  And to me, when I initially saw this, and I'm not, I don't deal with this kind of technology currently.
[01:09:00.779 --> 01:09:04.239]  I'm still a weapons engineer, and I still work for a contractor.
[01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:09.899]  But when I did, I helped stand up, you know, the counter-UAS pass force.
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.399]  I was the head of an organization that...
[01:09:12.559 --> 01:09:15.720]  That did a lot of red teaming within the DOD years ago.
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:30.239]  So from this perspective, though, you know, when it comes to detecting these things, and whether it's a military or not, my first impression was always that it was a test.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:31.479]  Now, there's some narratives that...
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:36.319]  That came up as far as nuclear material detection.
[01:09:37.079 --> 01:09:40.819]  I was skeptic about that just because of the payload.
[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:45.479]  We use what's called a size, weight, and power analysis when it comes to these small drones.
[01:09:45.819 --> 01:09:56.710]  And to put a detector on there to detect nuclear material, It can be done, but at distances that these drones were not flying.
[01:09:56.949 --> 01:10:02.989]  So you're talking like 100 meters or closer for specific sensors that detect nuclear material.
[01:10:03.149 --> 01:10:06.109]  But to me, from the beginning, I always thought it was a...
[01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:12.770]  Was some kind of contractor test or a DOD test, but most certainly these are not UAPs.
[01:10:12.949 --> 01:10:29.340]  These are likely U.S. drones from a three-letter agency or a contractor doing certain tests, and they can fly You know, legally, through the FAA, they can fly within those airspaces.
[01:10:29.479 --> 01:10:33.260]  So that's part of what I think Congress is trying to push is to change.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:37.420]  And to me, it has to be driven from the FAA. Change the rules.
[01:10:38.439 --> 01:10:39.920]  Ensure everything's registered.
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:48.560]  You know, maybe update some radars, domestic radars, and most certainly update DOD radars on domestic bases.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.100]  To include detection of these smaller drones.
[01:10:52.279 --> 01:10:57.939]  I mean, you know, there was even, I live near Hill Air Force Base, and we did a four-year request.
[01:10:58.479 --> 01:11:13.680]  This reporter here locally, his name is Brian McElhatton, but he did a four-year request, and he discovered that there's been drones in the last four years that have made incursions onto Hill Air Force Base and hovered over a fuel tank,
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.760]  you know, an aviation fuel tank.
[01:11:16.210 --> 01:11:17.050]  And then disappeared.
[01:11:17.409 --> 01:11:30.369]  So most absolutely, these things, to me in my mind, you know, there should be funding allocated in the NDAA to cover these kinds of emerging threats.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:35.899]  Well, and you know, quickly on that, there have obviously been a lot of stories they don't get as much attention.
[01:11:36.479 --> 01:11:48.479]  These drones are flying in mass in a very highly population-dense area where people can just go out on their back porch at night for a cocktail and they just see these drones in the sky.
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:49.699]  So it kind of made a lot of news.
[01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:59.619]  They've had problems at military installations and bases for some time now, but obviously when you're on a military base, you're not going out and blowing that up on your social media or to the news.
[01:11:59.619 --> 01:12:05.020]  So those things kind of don't really make Big news stories like what we saw in New Jersey.
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:07.800]  Now here's the latest in this development.
[01:12:07.939 --> 01:12:08.979]  I want to get your response here.
[01:12:10.279 --> 01:12:16.800]  FAA bans drones over parts of New Jersey, threatens deadly force for imminent security threat.
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:26.199]  They are banning, the FAA is banning drones, violating New Jersey bans until January 17th over special security reasons.
[01:12:27.039 --> 01:12:30.340]  What do you make of this latest development?
[01:12:32.739 --> 01:12:43.479]  Yeah, it's likely the lack of ability to detect, track, or know who's actually operating these drones.
[01:12:44.479 --> 01:12:50.260]  You know, and this is part of my skepticism with the DoD because, you know, we have...
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.939]  We have technologies to track these drones.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:13:13.899]  Certainly that domestic side does not, but just from a spectrum perspective, you know, F-18, you know, F-35 pilots on their cueing mechanism on their HUD heads-up display, they have a bounding box that they use,
[01:13:13.939 --> 01:13:16.020]  right, to track their targets.
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:28.380]  And so there's technologies, I don't want to get into too much of this side of it, but there's technologies that we have related to computer vision, or there's technologies we can do acoustic tracking.
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:37.460]  If you have triangulation, you have sensors that track acoustically, you can track something that emits noise.
[01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:47.869]  You know, and I'm not familiar with what the DOD is using exactly, but I can tell you that these technologies are already, they've been around for a long time.
[01:13:48.029 --> 01:13:48.949]  It can be done.
[01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:59.470]  And for the DOD to come out and, which is surprising, just from a leadership perspective, you don't come out and say, I don't know, and who knows, it could be UAPs.
[01:13:59.529 --> 01:14:07.750]  For me, You know, from a leadership perspective, you say what you do know, and then you say, you know, some of it's classified and I can't speak to it, right?
[01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:15.430]  So I think it's not only a leadership problem, you know, with this administration, but it's also just an overall transparency.
[01:14:15.649 --> 01:14:20.250]  I mean, we have to, this is why I'm glad Trump's getting into office, because we got to be more truthful.
[01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:21.350]  We got to be more transparent.
[01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:23.829]  And if we can't talk about something, it's fine.
[01:14:23.989 --> 01:14:25.670]  You know, just say you can't talk about it.
[01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:27.449]  Don't spin the narrative.
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:34.460]  You know, so people, there's almost a bubble of hysteria, right, from the nation.
[01:14:34.659 --> 01:14:46.779]  And then you get people that come out, and they look at their sky at night, and they mistake a neutron star or a pulsar for a UAP, you know, or other orbs, or even a sprite.
[01:14:47.039 --> 01:14:52.239]  You know, I've studied at length, you know, the UAP issue outside of the DoD.
[01:14:52.319 --> 01:14:54.600]  I've even worked here locally with Skinwalker Ranch.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:00.250]  And, you know, the anomalies we see in the sky, I would say 90% of them are explainable.
[01:15:00.449 --> 01:15:17.289]  And if they're not explainable by natural phenomena, there are certainly technologies that we have that we use from a space base or even terrestrial technologies that have certain effects within the upper atmosphere or the stratosphere.
[01:15:18.179 --> 01:15:32.699]  Whether it's the radio waves or lasers coming through the atmosphere for weather, you know, they have certain effects, visual effects that occur through the atmosphere.
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:46.920]  And that's not even mentioning, right, we're in a solar maximum cycle, so our coronal mass ejections or solar flares were at a height in 2025, so we see more aurora borealis, you know, effects.
[01:15:47.319 --> 01:15:55.300]  I think?
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:22.800]  I can't think of any reason why policy would change now after this has been going on for three weeks that now they're saying, okay, we're going to ban the drones from going up in the sky when even two weeks ago people were trying to fly drones in the sky and it looked like something was shutting them down.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.359]  No answer was given to that.
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.359]  So it's like now they have this policy after they say everything is fine.
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.479]  So nothing really adds up.
[01:16:28.539 --> 01:16:29.859]  But it feels like a game.
[01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:33.210]  They know exactly what's going on and they just kind of want to tease us.
[01:16:33.529 --> 01:16:39.090]  They just want to hold us in suspense and be like, well, we know, but the American people don't need to know.
[01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:40.130]  Just know that it's fine.
[01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:41.850]  Just know that we're in control.
[01:16:42.489 --> 01:16:49.029]  So it's just very offensive, I think, for them to come out and pretend like they don't know when obviously they know.
[01:16:49.229 --> 01:16:49.789]  And then...
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:54.180]  It's like the story is dying down, so then it's like, oh no, no, no, let's keep them in suspense.
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:57.119]  Let's now officially have a policy that bans drones.
[01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:58.020]  Yeah, that'll do it.
[01:16:58.079 --> 01:16:59.239]  That'll really keep them in suspense.
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:04.000]  It's just insulting and it's rude and inconsiderate to the American people how they're treating them.
[01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:06.130]  Agreed.
[01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:26.210]  Yeah, I mean, I've also delved into, you know, all the policy generated from the United Nations, you know, from the G20 or G7 summits and the column SDGs and how the Biden administration just globbed onto it and called it ESGs.
[01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:31.590]  They just changed the acronym, right, from SDGs to ESGs here locally, environmental, social, and governance.
[01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:34.750]  And so, to me, we see this.
[01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:48.430]  It's a horrendous top-down mandate coercion effect on the American people that I think is, frankly, it's dangerous, just for the fact that Americans love their freedom.
[01:17:49.210 --> 01:17:55.970]  As a veteran, I took an oath to defend and support the Constitution of the United States.
[01:17:56.610 --> 01:18:01.149]  That, you know, for veterans out there, that does not end when we die.
[01:18:01.369 --> 01:18:02.989]  That is a lifetime commitment.
[01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:06.310]  So when we're discharged from the military, that commitment is still there.
[01:18:06.449 --> 01:18:22.250]  And so for the Biden administration to come out and, you know, use all these terms like mismal and disinformation and then mandate it and collude with tech industry to facilitate their agenda, it's disgusting,
[01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:25.029]  frankly, to me, and dishonorable.
[01:18:25.890 --> 01:18:39.470]  To the service of all those veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedoms, for the Constitution, and yeah, frankly, it gets me spun up, so I'll dial it back.
[01:18:39.630 --> 01:18:42.289]  Well, you're right to get spun up, because it's bad.
[01:18:43.609 --> 01:18:44.689]  It's bad what they do.
[01:18:44.890 --> 01:18:47.649]  They treat our veterans, our military, like cannon fodder.
[01:18:47.770 --> 01:18:49.630]  All right, I want to hold you over through this break.
[01:18:49.630 --> 01:18:53.449]  You said something in the last segment I can't ignore, and that's Skinwalker Ranch.
[01:18:53.670 --> 01:18:55.770]  Now, I mean, we're going way off base today.
[01:18:59.130 --> 01:19:07.520]  All right, we still have our guest on who said something, if you know about This story, you hear it and your ears kind of perk up.
[01:19:07.739 --> 01:19:08.979]  So I want to go back to that in a second.
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:13.380]  I do want to give you an update on what's happening right now on Capitol Hill.
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:18.119]  The Republicans in control of the House are debating two things.
[01:19:18.659 --> 01:19:25.140]  And that is the bill that was proposed last night without the debt ceiling increase.
[01:19:25.659 --> 01:19:32.739]  And so they're shopping that around to see if they can get the votes from the Republicans to pass that bill.
[01:19:34.579 --> 01:19:39.760]  That was one of the big hiccups, but I don't think that will work.
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:44.760]  I think these Republicans are now just holdouts and maybe want the government shut down.
[01:19:45.979 --> 01:19:56.380]  The second option that they're weighing is three single-issue bills, a CR, a farm bill, and disaster relief.
[01:19:57.739 --> 01:20:01.779]  Those would have to have a rules vote and then be voted on tomorrow.
[01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:13.649]  So, in that instance, they have to see if they'll even have enough Republicans present to vote yes to get those three bills passed.
[01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:16.390]  So that's what's going on right now.
[01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:33.609]  First, they're going to see if they can get the votes on the same bill that failed last night without the debt limit increase, or they're going to try to get three single-issue votes, or, excuse me, three single-issue bills passed That would not be voted on until tomorrow.
[01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:36.090]  So that's what's going on right now.
[01:20:36.489 --> 01:20:38.170]  They were supposed to have a vote this morning.
[01:20:38.289 --> 01:20:38.829]  It didn't happen.
[01:20:38.989 --> 01:20:42.550]  That tells you Mike Johnson has completely just, he has nothing.
[01:20:43.529 --> 01:20:46.869]  So he was saying, oh, we're going to vote in the morning and we got a bill that's going to pass.
[01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:47.989]  And no, you didn't.
[01:20:48.649 --> 01:20:49.869]  A total failure again.
[01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:51.789]  So that's where we're at.
[01:20:51.949 --> 01:20:56.149]  Quite frankly, the three single issue bills is a decent option.
[01:20:57.210 --> 01:21:04.590]  You could argue about the continued resolution, whether you want to fund the government or not, but you would get the farm bill, you would get the disaster relief bill, and vote on that.
[01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:09.989]  But again, your issue is these members of Congress want to go home.
[01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:14.710]  They don't want to sit around D.C. for even another day to vote on this bill.
[01:21:15.029 --> 01:21:16.149]  So that's where you're at.
[01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:18.649]  And it's all just disgusting, really.
[01:21:18.970 --> 01:21:22.369]  Our government is just completely disgusting and despicable.
[01:21:22.649 --> 01:21:23.989]  So I say, shut it down.
[01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:27.470]  Alright.
[01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:31.569]  Others are saying they've already reached an agreement on the debt limit, but...
[01:21:32.449 --> 01:21:35.229]  Again, I'm not sure they have the votes yet.
[01:21:35.369 --> 01:21:38.470]  So, we'll be continuing to monitor that.
[01:21:38.989 --> 01:21:41.289]  Robert Newcomb is my guest.
[01:21:41.569 --> 01:21:55.050]  Now, okay, anybody who knows about Skinwalker Ranch, if you don't, this is one of the wildest stories, conspiracy theories, phenomenon ever, that you can look into.
[01:21:55.050 --> 01:22:21.130]  And it's mostly kind of the UFO... Alien extraterrestrial community that is really interested in that and kind of experts on that and there have been documentaries come out really just crazy stuff I had no idea Robert had anything to do with that so I just got to ask him what what was your role what what do you know about Skinwalker Ranch what was your role in I guess investigating it looking into it what what do you know about it?
[01:22:22.770 --> 01:22:23.649]  Excuse me.
[01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:31.369]  I've spent several years just out of interest, aside from my normal duties on my job.
[01:22:33.770 --> 01:22:39.770]  Researching UAPs, researching the technology that could justify what we see in our skies.
[01:22:41.170 --> 01:22:45.250]  When it comes to Skinwalker Ranch, it was more of a friend of a friend connection.
[01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:56.449]  But, you know, Brandon Fugel, Eric Bard, they were cordial and gracious enough to, you know, allow me to consult or have conversations with Eric Bard, who is the lead scientist there.
[01:22:57.750 --> 01:23:08.789]  Most of my experience over the last four years investigating UAPs, when it comes to Skinwalker Ranch, Skinwalker Ranch by itself is an anomaly to me.
[01:23:09.630 --> 01:23:13.710]  It's hard to explain the evidence that comes out of there.
[01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:32.779]  I've often explained it as an environmental anomaly, whether it's coming from outside of the Or off the Earth, you know, from a cosmic perspective, or it's being generated from the Earth kind of anomaly.
[01:23:33.039 --> 01:23:44.899]  And I just, you know, when I've researched all the UAP evidence and everything that happened, you know, from Tic Tac to Gimbal, Skinwalker Ranch always sticks out to me.
[01:23:45.039 --> 01:24:07.260]  And so my involvement there with Eric Bard was a series of consultations or conversations about what technology to deploy in order to drive out these anomalies, especially when it comes to AI or computer vision or camera systems or other networked or grid-type sensors.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:19.800]  To track the location of an anomaly, track via AI, track the visual identification of an anomaly.
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:22.199]  So I don't work there.
[01:24:22.199 --> 01:24:24.880]  It's a consultation effort in the past I have.
[01:24:24.979 --> 01:24:27.880]  So it's very limited, but for sure, 100%.
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:36.659]  Like I said previously, Skinwalker Ranch stands out to me above any other kind of research that I've done on the matter.
[01:24:36.979 --> 01:24:39.399]  Well, and people that haven't heard of it are out there in suspense.
[01:24:39.399 --> 01:24:40.060]  What is this?
[01:24:40.119 --> 01:24:40.979]  What are you talking about?
[01:24:41.399 --> 01:24:54.119]  Well, there's kind of like this, let's say, cultural mystery about it, and maybe extraterrestrial beings and just some of the kind of cultural history there, and it kind of ties into...
[01:24:54.729 --> 01:25:08.550]  Like, certain areas, like you talk about Area 51, where you're just out in the vast desert, and there's just, like, this local color of, yeah, we see aliens all the time, or, you know, spaceships, or there's weird things that go on in the desert, or even cave drawings, whatever.
[01:25:08.829 --> 01:25:10.630]  So there's that aspect of it.
[01:25:10.710 --> 01:25:11.270]  But then...
[01:25:12.039 --> 01:25:13.859]  Yeah.
[01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:42.590]  And dealing with livestock and stuff that happens that is just completely unexplainable yet easily documented.
[01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:45.250]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:25:45.529 --> 01:25:51.989]  And, you know, there's dozens of examples, like I said, evidence that comes to mind.
[01:25:52.710 --> 01:26:11.350]  You know, I think what they're doing at Skinwalker Ranch and the effort or money that Brandon Fugle is putting forward to discover this or to drive out, you know, this anomalous behavior will eventually lead to new discoveries,
[01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:12.289]  you know, in science.
[01:26:12.909 --> 01:26:28.449]  As our technology advances, AI comes on board, a lot of these sensors get more You know, they can drive out more detail in the data, and especially as LQMs,
[01:26:28.630 --> 01:26:44.750]  large quantitative models, come out, which are really a physics or a science-based model, AI model, and they do what's called a recursive research, which these LQMs, large quantitative models,
[01:26:44.890 --> 01:26:57.760]  can do is We're good to go.
[01:27:07.449 --> 01:27:11.670]  If left under Biden, it would have been a crash and burn for our society.
[01:27:12.170 --> 01:27:24.750]  Under Trump, however, I actually have, I'm optimistic, I'm hopeful that, you know, this AI effort will come out to good fruition.
[01:27:26.029 --> 01:27:26.670]  So...
[01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:44.750]  U.S. government involvement is there at Skinwalker Ranch because there's all these other historical sites where if citizens, you know, want to just even just show up and start filming or some sites where people might show up with a shovel,
[01:27:44.949 --> 01:27:48.270]  I mean, there'll be people that show up out of the woods immediately and you're like, whoa, what the hell?
[01:27:49.630 --> 01:27:53.090]  How much government involvement is there at Skinwalker Ranch?
[01:27:53.170 --> 01:27:57.329]  Do they have tight ropes on that or is it like kind of a free-for-all?
[01:27:59.559 --> 01:28:04.359]  I'm not familiar with any three-letter agencies that are involved in Skinwalker Ranch currently.
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:07.859]  I know historically they have been...
[01:28:07.859 --> 01:28:12.300]  I forgot the individual's name, but he owned it previously to Fugle.
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.880]  But I'm sure...
[01:28:16.319 --> 01:28:24.359]  There's no doubt in my mind, however, that some three-letter agencies still has a pulse on what's being discovered there.
[01:28:24.399 --> 01:28:33.479]  I'm sure in bat channels, which I'm not familiar with, there could be some dialogue there between those three-letter agencies and Skinwalker Ranch.
[01:28:33.619 --> 01:28:35.100]  That I do not know, though.
[01:28:35.899 --> 01:28:37.819]  Well, they love to be around...
[01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:52.819]  Not just human interest stories, but when there's actual genuine historical stuff going on or genuine aerial phenomenon stuff going on, whether that's just they don't want you to know what's really going on or they're interested for themselves, they always seem to find their way, right?
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:59.340]  They always seem to find their way on there, if not permanently entrenched there to protect people from trying to find the truth.
[01:28:59.699 --> 01:29:03.899]  So that's an amazing story that you're involved there.
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:13.560]  Truly, folks, just if you want one of the more curious UFO, alien, extraterrestrial, anomaly, phenomenon stories.
[01:29:13.779 --> 01:29:18.119]  Skinwalker Ranch is certainly one you can dig into and just say, what in the hell is that?
[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:20.819]  And there's so much actual on-the-ground evidence.
[01:29:20.819 --> 01:29:24.720]  It's not just people with blurry photos or stories without any evidence.
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.920]  It's like you're there on the ground and they got a lot of things that they've seen and can show you.
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:31.819]  All right, Robert Newcomb, I really appreciate your time today.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.399]  DefendUT.com is his website.
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:36.779]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:37.970]  All right, brother.
[01:29:38.109 --> 01:29:38.510]  Good to meet you.
[01:29:38.689 --> 01:29:39.050]  You too.
[01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:44.569]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to get more into any developments we have coming off of Capitol Hill.
[01:29:44.810 --> 01:29:47.250]  I still have some clips from last night we may play.
[01:29:47.250 --> 01:29:50.810]  I do have some other geopolitical news that we can get to.
[01:29:51.090 --> 01:29:57.710]  And we also have a special report from Alex Jones coming up in about T-minus 15 or 20 minutes.
[01:29:58.569 --> 01:30:03.149]  So plenty to go here before Jay Dyer takes over to host the fourth hour.
[01:30:05.839 --> 01:30:10.939]  Remember, thealexjonesstore.com is the best way to show your support for Alex right now.
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:14.020]  And there are plenty of options there for you.
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:21.020]  Like old classic InfoWars apparel, t-shirts, hats, designs from years ago.
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:25.720]  We're going back even decades sometimes for some of this apparel.
[01:30:25.899 --> 01:30:28.319]  Plus the new apparel as well.
[01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:30.000]  So a very large apparel.
[01:30:30.029 --> 01:30:37.869]  We have a large store there at thealexjonesstore.com for you to choose from as far as all the different InfoWars and Alex Jones apparel is concerned.
[01:30:38.090 --> 01:30:40.210]  Of course, we have the Trump One gear as well.
[01:30:40.289 --> 01:30:43.829]  The Trump One hoodies, the Trump One t-shirts, the Trump One hats.
[01:30:44.109 --> 01:30:45.670]  Very popular as well.
[01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:57.880]  And you hear Alex talking about the new supplements there that he loves so much, like Ultimate Seamoss Gummies, which are available at a discounted rate right now as well.
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:59.920]  It's all available at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:13.439]  And don't forget, when you become a member of the VIP club, thealexjonesstore.com slash VIP. You get increased opportunities for the giveaways when you make purchases.
[01:31:13.439 --> 01:31:16.279]  You get free shipping on orders over $99.
[01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:21.859]  You get monthly membership credits and so much more.
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:28.180]  You gotta go to thealexjonesstore.com slash VIP to learn all about it and become a member of the club.
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:36.520]  But either way, when you shop at thealexjonesstore.com with every purchase, you get multiple entries into the Monster Truck Raffle.
[01:31:37.149 --> 01:31:40.609]  Which is happening right now.
[01:31:41.289 --> 01:31:41.930]  Okay.
[01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:46.890]  We got some illegal immigrant news here.
[01:31:47.109 --> 01:31:48.689]  That never seems to stop.
[01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:59.510]  But right now, again, folks, everything is happening behind closed doors with the continued resolution versus government shutdown.
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:16.380]  And basically the Republicans are weighing two options, and that's either to bring last night's bill back to the floor without the debt limit increase, or to bring three separate bills, which would be one, a continued resolution,
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:22.260]  two, disaster relief aid, and three, the farm bill.
[01:32:24.399 --> 01:32:28.979]  But those would not be available to be voted on until tomorrow.
[01:32:29.819 --> 01:32:39.359]  So the risk there, even though those might be the most likely to get the votes, the risk there would be people are already saying, threatening that they're not going to be there tomorrow no matter what.
[01:32:39.539 --> 01:32:42.539]  So bring the bill to the floor tonight or we're leaving tomorrow.
[01:32:42.539 --> 01:32:44.319]  We're not going to vote on a single issue bill.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.359]  Which is really too bad.
[01:32:48.810 --> 01:32:52.949]  I'd say that's too bad that members of Congress would feel that way.
[01:32:53.250 --> 01:33:00.329]  But at the same time, they should have done the single issue bill today.
[01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:02.170]  It's what they should have done.
[01:33:02.909 --> 01:33:04.409]  And you could have avoided this whole thing.
[01:33:05.890 --> 01:33:07.430]  And it's not clear to me...
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:27.060]  And I'm trying to find out what the continued resolution bill is, but my guess would be it's the Freedom Caucus continued resolution bill that Clay Higgins was sponsoring that was a clean continued resolution, 22 pages long, that you could actually read and then go vote on.
[01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:36.579]  So not some bill that they want to plop down on your desk and say go vote on it, but a bill you can actually get and read and go vote on it.
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:43.600]  Now of course all of this is in violation of the 72-hour rule, but they don't really seem to care much about that, do they?
[01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:46.680]  They don't seem to care much about that.
[01:33:48.539 --> 01:33:51.859]  Now last night you had some clown shows going on.
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:34:00.260]  Including this Democrat Rosa DeLauro, which is just a man who goes around in a wig, a purple wig and a dress.
[01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:04.800]  I mean, just look at this crap, guys.
[01:34:05.119 --> 01:34:05.979]  Go ahead and play clip one.
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:07.680]  ...on a bill.
[01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:09.260]  They signed it.
[01:34:10.739 --> 01:34:11.979]  And you know what?
[01:34:12.899 --> 01:34:14.279]  They got scared.
[01:34:16.209 --> 01:34:17.590]  Wait, is that not a dude?
[01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:18.529]  I don't know.
[01:34:18.689 --> 01:34:19.350]  Who knows these days?
[01:34:21.630 --> 01:34:24.949]  It's a dude, it's a man, it's a woman, it's a Democrat.
[01:34:25.449 --> 01:34:26.170]  Don't do it.
[01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:28.310]  Shut the government down.
[01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.970]  Imagine.
[01:34:29.869 --> 01:34:35.729]  What does he know about what people go through is when the government shuts down.
[01:34:37.069 --> 01:34:39.229]  Are his employees furloughed?
[01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:40.430]  Hell no.
[01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:42.850]  Is he furloughed?
[01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.829]  No.
[01:34:44.210 --> 01:34:48.029]  And when you shut the government down, people don't get paid.
[01:34:48.409 --> 01:34:57.130]  And maybe if none of us got paid if the government shut down, some people on the other side of the aisle would feel differently about where we're going in this effort.
[01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:59.090]  We had an agreement.
[01:34:59.310 --> 01:35:00.170]  But, you know, this is not...
[01:35:00.170 --> 01:35:00.909]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:35:01.050 --> 01:35:01.949]  The Democrats...
[01:35:01.949 --> 01:35:03.489]  The Democrats had a bill they wanted.
[01:35:03.529 --> 01:35:07.569]  ...from what we've experienced over the last year and a half or so.
[01:35:07.850 --> 01:35:08.829]  Think about it.
[01:35:08.949 --> 01:35:11.970]  Biden-McCarthy, deal, come together.
[01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:14.069]  Next day, walk away.
[01:35:14.729 --> 01:35:16.609]  Johnson-Schumer, deal.
[01:35:16.909 --> 01:35:18.710]  Next day, walk away.
[01:35:19.029 --> 01:35:22.909]  And now this deal, walk away from it.
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:24.520]  Good.
[01:35:24.659 --> 01:35:26.760]  Who do we trust in this body?
[01:35:27.079 --> 01:35:27.420]  No one.
[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.579]  And above all, can the American people trust us?
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:30.359]  No.
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:31.640]  Trust us with their lives.
[01:35:31.779 --> 01:35:31.899]  No.
[01:35:31.939 --> 01:35:41.100]  When we had a moment, when we came to agreement as Democrats and Republicans, and then we were able to say, let's move forward.
[01:35:41.699 --> 01:35:45.920]  You know, one of my colleagues, I think it was Congressman Neal who said this.
[01:35:48.699 --> 01:35:49.720]  What do you guys think?
[01:35:51.119 --> 01:35:51.960]  Man or woman?
[01:35:56.090 --> 01:35:56.770]  What do we think, guys?
[01:35:58.449 --> 01:35:59.550]  They think it's a woman.
[01:35:59.710 --> 01:36:00.369]  I'm not so sure.
[01:36:00.489 --> 01:36:01.829]  This could have been an early transition.
[01:36:03.649 --> 01:36:07.609]  She could have been an early transition situation there.
[01:36:08.930 --> 01:36:10.529]  That is a skexy, man.
[01:36:10.670 --> 01:36:12.130]  I mean, that is about...
[01:36:12.130 --> 01:36:17.970]  You put her and Pelosi next to one another and you think you're in the Jim Henson movie, Dark Crystal.
[01:36:27.010 --> 01:36:31.390]  You also had Democrats getting scolded when Anna Paulina Luna was trying to speak.
[01:36:33.130 --> 01:36:39.909]  You can't even really pick it up over the microphone, but they were really out of control last night.
[01:36:40.569 --> 01:36:46.250]  And I've never seen a House gavel get banged harder because they were completely out of control, clip two.
[01:36:48.219 --> 01:37:03.359]  But I'm here today because I realize that the plan that's on the table currently to keep our government open, but also the promise from the only president in my lifetime who's ever followed through on all of his campaign promises to the American people.
[01:37:03.579 --> 01:37:05.359]  Excuse me, I'm not done talking.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:07.760]  Give me the same respect we give you guys.
[01:37:09.119 --> 01:37:10.819]  The House will come to order.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.369]  My colleagues are reminded The gentlewoman has the floor.
[01:37:15.689 --> 01:37:17.329]  She has the right to be heard.
[01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:26.289]  The gentlewoman has the right to be heard, and the gentlewoman would be reminded to direct her comments to the chair.
[01:37:26.529 --> 01:37:28.750]  The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized.
[01:37:29.050 --> 01:37:38.930]  From the only president in my lifetime who's fulfilled all of his campaign promises to the American people, has promised to cut hundreds of billion dollars in reconciliation.
[01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:41.109]  You want to talk about shutting down the government.
[01:37:41.609 --> 01:37:49.909]  The deal that was negotiated was largely rejected by the American people, which two speakers, Johnson's credit, pulled it from the floor, which is why we are here today.
[01:37:50.210 --> 01:37:58.229]  The deal on the table will keep the government open for the American people, and if you guys so choose to shut it down, it will be on you, but not the Republican Party.
[01:37:58.710 --> 01:38:00.750]  We will not be going back to the table.
[01:38:00.850 --> 01:38:08.090]  This deal stands as it is, so let you go back home on Christmas and explain to your people why you shut down the government, because we won't be doing it.
[01:38:12.309 --> 01:38:14.470]  Furthermore, furthermore, Mr. Speaker.
[01:38:19.710 --> 01:38:22.409]  That's a strong gavel.
[01:38:22.649 --> 01:38:23.369]  The House will be in order.
[01:38:23.609 --> 01:38:25.409]  I mean, he slammed that thing.
[01:38:25.930 --> 01:38:29.289]  The gentlewoman is reminded to direct her comments to the chair.
[01:38:29.550 --> 01:38:31.529]  My colleagues are reminded.
[01:38:31.829 --> 01:38:38.550]  I just don't understand why it's this weird little political thing where they want to blame the other side for the government shutdown.
[01:38:38.930 --> 01:38:40.250]  Just own it.
[01:38:42.699 --> 01:38:45.020]  Own it and judo it.
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:48.399]  Look at the government.
[01:38:49.779 --> 01:38:51.420]  Look at the government's approval ratings.
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:54.800]  Look at Joe Biden's approval ratings.
[01:38:55.699 --> 01:38:57.300]  Look at all the different biocracies.
[01:38:57.399 --> 01:38:58.199]  Look at their approval ratings.
[01:38:59.039 --> 01:39:00.859]  Look at the corporate media's approval ratings.
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.159]  There's no populism there.
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:08.000]  The government is not popular.
[01:39:09.449 --> 01:39:12.670]  The mainstream media pointing their finger at you, saying you shut down the government.
[01:39:12.729 --> 01:39:13.430]  It's not popular.
[01:39:13.609 --> 01:39:14.649]  Congress is not popular.
[01:39:17.710 --> 01:39:19.090]  So I just don't get this.
[01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:21.149]  You're going to blame for the government shutdown.
[01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:22.390]  You're going to blame for the government shutdown.
[01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:27.430]  It's like, hey, can you get the emergency relief that you've screwed the American people over for years?
[01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:31.909]  No, you're the government shutdown.
[01:39:32.029 --> 01:39:32.670]  You're the government shutdown.
[01:39:34.210 --> 01:39:36.949]  They're about to be wrapping a conference meeting on the Hill right now.
[01:39:36.949 --> 01:39:38.489]  I'll have an update on that.
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:42.479]  There might be a change in the situation.
[01:39:42.479 --> 01:39:43.119]  I'll let you know.
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:45.680]  Here's Democrat Congressman Richard Neal.
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:50.720]  They're all mad about the influence of we the people.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:54.079]  They just blame X, but it's we the people in clip three.
[01:39:55.359 --> 01:39:57.460]  And a tweet changed all of it?
[01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:14.460]  Can you imagine what the next two years are gonna be like if every time the Congress works its will and then there's a tweet Or from an individual who has no official portfolio, who threatens members on the Republican side with a primary,
[01:40:14.819 --> 01:40:16.140]  and they succumb?
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:24.979]  This institution has a separate responsibility based upon the separation of powers.
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:29.800]  Members of Congress don't serve under presidents of the United States.
[01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:32.239]  You know, I want to explain something here.
[01:40:32.359 --> 01:40:39.399]  I want to pull up a post from Democrat Jasmine Crockett.
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:41.119]  She says...
[01:40:41.119 --> 01:40:47.000]  Where is it here?
[01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:51.840]  Let me try to find this.
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:58.380]  Well, the point is...
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:05.819]  Yeah, she says, which branch of government does Elon Musk belong to?
[01:41:07.739 --> 01:41:11.800]  Let's just put this all in perspective as we close out the second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:14.600]  Which branch of government does Elon Musk belong to?
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:27.319]  Well, actually, Jasmine, part of government that Elon Musk belongs to is actually the most important part of government.
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:33.399]  And it seems as though you and your colleagues have forgotten the most important part of the government.
[01:41:33.399 --> 01:41:36.920]  And that part is we, the people.
[01:41:38.890 --> 01:41:40.130]  We the people.
[01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:46.829]  You see, Congress is not supposed to execute its will over us.
[01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:52.550]  Our government is not supposed to dictate our future to us.
[01:41:53.189 --> 01:41:54.810]  It's actually the opposite.
[01:41:57.430 --> 01:42:00.630]  And you just got a little taste of that.
[01:42:01.029 --> 01:42:02.449]  And you don't like it.
[01:42:02.550 --> 01:42:07.510]  He says, well, can you imagine two years of the people deciding their fate?
[01:42:08.949 --> 01:42:16.970]  Can you imagine the next two years of Americans getting to voice their opinion and have an influence over this Congress?
[01:42:16.970 --> 01:42:18.250]  Can you believe it?
[01:42:19.329 --> 01:42:21.090]  Yeah, we the people are back.
[01:42:21.609 --> 01:42:23.550]  We are taking our government back.
[01:42:23.710 --> 01:42:27.010]  We're taking our future back, our destiny back, our country back.
[01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:29.050]  You don't seem to like it that much.
[01:42:29.949 --> 01:42:31.590]  But we're not going anywhere.
[01:42:32.409 --> 01:42:37.909]  And this is a huge threshold that has been crossed, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:42.800]  And I explained it yesterday when I opened the war room.
[01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:46.579]  I'm almost out of time here, but I'll explain it when I come back.
[01:42:47.579 --> 01:42:55.159]  Yesterday's failure to pass the bill and the response from Congress since is a major threshold...
[01:42:56.409 --> 01:42:58.369]  And I'll explain that when we come back.
[01:42:58.810 --> 01:43:06.609]  And we have a special report coming up from Alex Jones as we enter the third hour of the Alex Jones show.
[01:43:07.149 --> 01:43:08.210]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:43:08.449 --> 01:43:09.890]  News is breaking by the minute.
[01:43:25.829 --> 01:43:34.529]  The sad reality is your government has been corrupt your entire life.
[01:43:34.850 --> 01:43:35.810]  Extremely corrupt.
[01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:39.689]  Most of your politicians and members of Congress have been corrupt as well.
[01:43:43.130 --> 01:43:47.890]  And the American people have finally woken up to it.
[01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:51.460]  And we're trying to get some representation.
[01:43:51.779 --> 01:43:58.079]  We're trying to get some leadership that isn't corrupt, that actually wants to help the country, that actually wants to act on their own.
[01:43:59.279 --> 01:44:07.220]  And you're starting to see the results of that with the rise of Donald Trump, the emergence of Elon Musk politically, and some other members of Congress here and there.
[01:44:11.529 --> 01:44:20.630]  But why are these politicians, and specifically in the recent developments on the Democrats' side of the aisle, so upset that you finally have a say again?
[01:44:20.630 --> 01:44:23.310]  So upset that your voice is finally being heard again?
[01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:27.930]  Well, because normally they're able to operate in the shadows.
[01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:37.869]  Normally they're able to show up, vote on these criminal bills, and go home without barely hearing a peep about it.
[01:44:39.119 --> 01:44:40.479]  But that's not the case anymore.
[01:44:40.699 --> 01:44:41.520]  So that upsets them.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:45.920]  But here's the real threshold that is represented by this development here.
[01:44:47.539 --> 01:44:52.619]  For really the last...
[01:44:52.619 --> 01:44:56.180]  Well, forever, you could argue.
[01:44:57.899 --> 01:45:01.899]  But certainly in modern American history, political communication...
[01:45:03.819 --> 01:45:10.739]  Between politicians and their constituents, political leaders, and the American people has been a one-way street.
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:23.020]  Meaning, they make statements on the floor, and you hear them, they go do interviews on TV or radio, and you listen, and that's it.
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:25.680]  It's a one-way street.
[01:45:25.899 --> 01:45:26.819]  They talk, you listen.
[01:45:30.439 --> 01:45:36.260]  And the only way they might ever hear you is if you call their office, send them a message, or maybe go vote.
[01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:40.840]  But in the day-to-day, it's a one-way street.
[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:41.720]  They talk, you listen.
[01:45:41.859 --> 01:45:48.560]  Well, now, because of X, and by the way, that determines how they behave.
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:52.699]  And so they know they can get away with everything, so they really don't have to care about what the American people think.
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:54.239]  They don't have to care about what their constituents think.
[01:45:54.479 --> 01:45:59.420]  But now, thanks to social media, and specifically X, it's now a two-way street.
[01:46:00.119 --> 01:46:03.340]  Now they communicate and they get immediate feedback.
[01:46:04.399 --> 01:46:07.399]  Now they can communicate and see what's popular, what's not popular.
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:15.800]  Now they can communicate and see what other people are thinking, what other people are feeling, or even things that they didn't know or think themselves.
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.100]  Now it's a two-way street.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  So now you have to live in this infinite feedback loop of action-reaction instead of, oh, I'm just talking and you're listening and then that's the end of the story.
[01:46:29.399 --> 01:46:31.939]  So this is changing the face of American politics.
[01:46:32.039 --> 01:46:38.000]  This is forcing politicians to finally react to or bend to the will of the American people.
[01:46:38.039 --> 01:46:40.640]  And you can tell some people are really upset about that.
[01:46:41.939 --> 01:46:42.939]  Mostly Democrats.
[01:46:44.899 --> 01:46:49.399]  So this is a major threshold crossing moment.
[01:46:49.539 --> 01:46:55.920]  This is a major game changing moment in American politics and really the course of political history on a global scale.
[01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:04.819]  But getting to operate in the darkness, getting one-way communication paths is over.
[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:06.220]  It's over.
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:09.340]  People are paying attention now.
[01:47:09.619 --> 01:47:11.239]  People are engaged.
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:12.140]  They're activated.
[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:13.520]  They understand things now.
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:15.119]  And we have the immediate feedback.
[01:47:16.779 --> 01:47:18.000]  You can go look.
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:18.880]  There's a couple examples.
[01:47:19.699 --> 01:47:23.579]  Go look at Dan Crenshaw's recent social media post.
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:27.960]  This guy is one of the least popular men in Congress on the Republican side.
[01:47:28.239 --> 01:47:38.020]  He's had a complete mental break going on diatribes, curse-laden diatribes against American people, against Texans.
[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:42.319]  And then there's Thomas Massey, maybe one of the only conservatives left in our government.
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:43.579]  Very popular.
[01:47:43.779 --> 01:47:45.180]  Nothing but positive feedback.
[01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:49.369]  So now everyone else can kind of look at that and say, hmm, which way do I go?
[01:47:49.529 --> 01:47:51.789]  Do I go the way of Dan Crenshaw, who nobody likes?
[01:47:51.970 --> 01:47:54.529]  Or do I go the way of Thomas Massey, who's very popular?
[01:47:55.149 --> 01:47:58.310]  So this is the impact of We the People and now social media.
[01:48:01.409 --> 01:48:04.409]  Welcome back to this live Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:48:04.489 --> 01:48:05.850]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:48:05.970 --> 01:48:25.760]  I want to play a very informative, very powerful clip from Tim Poole last night on his TimCast talking to a well-known leftist who just thinks that Trump supporters from J6 that got set up by the feds and the whole fedsurrection deserve to be thrown away into prison and not even charged or ever tried.
[01:48:26.039 --> 01:48:27.380]  I mean, this is the essence of tyranny.
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:34.460]  And they're trying to set the precedent for this to then expand that against other populist and Trump supporters going forward.
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:41.500]  And the Democrats have said if Trump would have lost this election, if they could have stolen it, they were going to weaponize it against basically all Trump supporters.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:42.760]  And then we really are in 1984-19.
[01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:45.840]  So these people weren't given due process.
[01:48:46.079 --> 01:48:47.420]  Many of them haven't been charged.
[01:48:47.819 --> 01:48:50.939]  And they're being held in cruel and unusual circumstances.
[01:48:50.939 --> 01:48:52.479]  And they all need to be released.
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:55.500]  Trump's saying, well, I'm going to release everybody that looks like they're innocent.
[01:48:55.779 --> 01:48:57.159]  He has to release everybody.
[01:48:57.819 --> 01:49:03.739]  Because they got set up with the feds provocateuring and triggering the police to attack the general crowd.
[01:49:04.529 --> 01:49:08.569]  And so it's better that 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man go to prison.
[01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:10.149]  They haven't been given due process.
[01:49:10.329 --> 01:49:11.289]  It's all political.
[01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:14.210]  They all need to be released now.
[01:49:14.350 --> 01:49:18.989]  There are people three years in prison for just going inside the Capitol and they never even had a trial.
[01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:21.310]  So here's Tim Pool laying it all out.
[01:49:21.909 --> 01:49:28.130]  We need to see the J6 criminals like Liz Cheney and the rest of them that have been caught tampering with evidence charged.
[01:49:28.689 --> 01:49:32.210]  Kinzinger, Schiff, they're already under investigation.
[01:49:32.210 --> 01:49:35.630]  The Trump administration incoming is going after them, and that is good.
[01:49:35.789 --> 01:49:37.069]  That is the right thing to do.
[01:49:37.149 --> 01:49:43.069]  And we will destroy this fraudulent narrative of J6 and actually punish the feds that were in the crowd and did launch the attack.
[01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:45.010]  Here's Tim Pool's excellent analysis.
[01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:46.369]  You have?
[01:49:46.670 --> 01:49:47.630]  No, I haven't.
[01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:48.810]  No, no, no, stop, stop.
[01:49:48.909 --> 01:49:50.930]  You don't know anything about these January 6th cases.
[01:49:50.989 --> 01:49:52.670]  You don't know why these people are in jail.
[01:49:52.789 --> 01:49:56.430]  You don't know that a man is in Brooklyn right now for three years without charge or trial.
[01:49:56.569 --> 01:50:01.550]  And when Donald Trump says, these people have been held for too long, you say, no, Trump is wrong.
[01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:02.569]  Keep them locked up.
[01:50:02.689 --> 01:50:04.229]  That's fucking fascist.
[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:10.460]  Dude, you have been sitting here with no knowledge of the specifics of some of these cases.
[01:50:10.659 --> 01:50:14.880]  There is a man in Brooklyn right now, I'm going to say it again, no charges whatsoever brought.
[01:50:14.899 --> 01:50:17.199]  He's been in jail for three fucking years.
[01:50:17.619 --> 01:50:21.260]  For you to sit there and say it is good that he remains locked up is fascism.
[01:50:21.710 --> 01:50:27.289]  That is saying the hierarchy, the hierarchical system of the courts and the government is just and the process is all that matters.
[01:50:27.770 --> 01:50:34.550]  And I am saying perhaps three years is enough because I actually have moral logic and an understanding of these cases.
[01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:39.510]  Hence, my position on January 6th has always been the people who have attacked police must go to prison.
[01:50:39.649 --> 01:50:42.810]  But three years is a fucking long time for assault on an officer.
[01:50:43.069 --> 01:50:52.229]  We have seen people on the far left, notably when they were firebombing shit all across Minnesota, 33 people murdered And how many criminal charges do we get for this?
[01:50:52.369 --> 01:51:08.789]  When they firebombed a police station and forced the police to evacuate on May 29th, 2020, when thousands of far leftists firebombed the White House grounds and set fire to St. John's Church and injured 100 police officers, how many fucking people went to prison for three years?
[01:51:08.930 --> 01:51:12.170]  How many of them who never showed up on that day are in prison for 20 years?
[01:51:12.489 --> 01:51:15.949]  Enrique Tarrio wasn't even in D.C. on January 6th.
[01:51:15.989 --> 01:51:20.510]  And you are saying that man, who only, his only crime was, quote, Don't leave.
[01:51:20.729 --> 01:51:21.590]  That's his only crime.
[01:51:21.729 --> 01:51:24.369]  You think he should be in prison for 20 years because you're a fascist.
[01:51:24.489 --> 01:51:25.630]  You don't care what the facts are.
[01:51:25.789 --> 01:51:27.270]  You don't care if this is unjust.
[01:51:27.529 --> 01:51:32.390]  You only care that the machine state has decreed you are not to be locked up.
[01:51:32.590 --> 01:51:34.250]  And this is the problem I have with the left.
[01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:35.430]  They don't know the facts.
[01:51:35.550 --> 01:51:36.649]  They don't care about the facts.
[01:51:36.789 --> 01:51:39.470]  They view morality as a blanket government stroke of the pen.
[01:51:39.810 --> 01:51:43.329]  And every person, regardless of their crime, should be in prison for decades.
[01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:44.529]  I reject it outright.
[01:51:44.770 --> 01:51:47.210]  The people who fought cops should go to prison.
[01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.850]  They did.
[01:51:48.010 --> 01:51:49.010]  It's been three years.
[01:51:49.409 --> 01:51:54.770]  But when you've got people who are on misdemeanor charges for having walked into a building at 4 p.m.
[01:51:54.970 --> 01:52:01.250]  after the riot, and I know some of these people, they walked into a building for two minutes and walked out, and they got 18 months for that.
[01:52:01.470 --> 01:52:07.909]  I don't see you defending the innocent people who walked onto a public grass at a public building after a riot had been completed.
[01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.689]  You don't know.
[01:52:08.789 --> 01:52:09.470]  You don't care.
[01:52:09.630 --> 01:52:12.630]  You've taken a tribal position, and people are suffering because of it.
[01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:19.880]  Now you say that Donald Trump saying the injustice that we've seen warrants commutation or pardons, you say that means he's advocating for violence.
[01:52:20.159 --> 01:52:21.579]  This is the ultimate problem.
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:25.079]  Then you cite a press release from Maryland saying, but the right's more violent.
[01:52:25.239 --> 01:52:33.180]  There is a distinction between a white supremacist as a right-wing group and a run-of-the-mill Christian conservative who showed up on that day not to protest.
[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:34.739]  Let's talk about Brandon Strzok.
[01:52:34.859 --> 01:52:35.880]  He never went in the building.
[01:52:36.079 --> 01:52:37.640]  He was on the other side of the building.
[01:52:37.819 --> 01:52:38.939]  There was a permanent protest.
[01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:41.300]  He walked up the stairs and he was yelling.
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:42.979]  They put this guy in prison.
[01:52:43.439 --> 01:52:48.659]  There is Owen Schroyer, who was at a permanent rally, who was yelling death to communists.
[01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:51.960]  They put him in prison and specifically cited his speech.
[01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:54.460]  My dude, you don't know what you're talking about.
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:55.460]  And it's fine.
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:55.979]  I get it.
[01:52:56.039 --> 01:52:56.760]  We try to be polite.
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:57.479]  We try to be nice.
[01:52:57.659 --> 01:53:04.960]  But there are so many young liberals who sit here and say, the corporate press told me that these people are bad and the machine state government has decreed it by pen.
[01:53:05.119 --> 01:53:06.680]  So I don't care what crime they committed.
[01:53:06.819 --> 01:53:08.079]  I don't care what the jury said.
[01:53:08.279 --> 01:53:09.359]  I don't care who was on the jury.
[01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:12.500]  Enrique Tarrio, who was not there, should be in prison for two decades.
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:13.460]  Tell me this now.
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:14.899]  Why is Enrique Tarrio in prison?
[01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:19.810]  Yeah, so they uncovered with him his plot to overthrow the government.
[01:53:20.729 --> 01:53:21.449]  Enrique Torres?
[01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:22.949]  Yeah, and his organization.
[01:53:23.170 --> 01:53:23.529]  What plot?
[01:53:24.329 --> 01:53:24.829]  Who's they?
[01:53:25.810 --> 01:53:28.010]  Give me some data.
[01:53:28.409 --> 01:53:30.989]  Stop squinting at me and saying the prosecutors did a thing.
[01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:31.649]  You didn't know.
[01:53:31.770 --> 01:53:32.390]  You didn't read it.
[01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:33.529]  You didn't read the court papers.
[01:53:33.829 --> 01:53:38.390]  All you know is the fascist machine state told you he should be in prison and you're saying yes to them.
[01:53:38.899 --> 01:53:44.020]  I also think it's interesting that this report comes out the day after Chris Wray resigns.
[01:53:44.319 --> 01:53:52.359]  It seems to me that he may not have wanted to contend with the questions that of course are going to emerge from everything that we're learning today.
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:54:06.470]  And the other point I'd like to make is something that David Sponchus raised, where he said that Matthew Graves, who's the U.S. Attorney here in Washington, D.C., did not prosecute any of those confidential human sources, spies, that did enter the Capitol that day.
[01:54:06.689 --> 01:54:16.810]  And Graves' office did put out a statement and said that they did not generally prosecute anyone who just went into the Capitol and didn't commit other crimes.
[01:54:17.210 --> 01:54:19.310]  My question there is, what does generally mean?
[01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:20.649]  How did they make those decisions?
[01:54:21.090 --> 01:54:25.350]  And why weren't those particular paid spies part of that group?
[01:54:25.789 --> 01:54:31.869]  The 23 confidential human sources just reading through this, Carrie, three of them entered the Capitol during the riot.
[01:54:32.010 --> 01:54:35.210]  An additional 11 entered the restricted area around the Capitol, to your point.
[01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:41.010]  Based on what we have learned so far in the details of this report, how would you characterize the findings?
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.880]  The feds have been caught.
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:47.500]  They ran J6 just like I told you four years ago.
[01:54:47.659 --> 01:54:48.260]  I was there.
[01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:49.340]  I witnessed it.
[01:54:49.539 --> 01:54:54.520]  So now everyone who is set up in this false flag operation must be freed.
[01:54:54.819 --> 01:54:59.260]  They are victims of a totalitarian deep state system that is in free fall collapse.
[01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:08.680]  Did any FBI agents or confidential informants actively participate in the events of January 6th?
[01:55:08.739 --> 01:55:09.100]  Yes or no?
[01:55:10.279 --> 01:55:11.300]  I can't answer that.
[01:55:11.659 --> 01:55:16.060]  For me, it was surreal to watch the hearings and they're acting like I wanted to attack the Capitol.
[01:55:16.399 --> 01:55:19.659]  Then they omit the footage of us trying to stop people going in the Capitol.
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:22.359]  They really don't want us to talk about Ray Epps.
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:23.560]  Who is Ray Epps?
[01:55:24.199 --> 01:55:25.659]  I'm aware of the individual, sir.
[01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:28.380]  I don't have the specific background to him.
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:30.500]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[01:55:30.779 --> 01:55:31.220]  Fed!
[01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:31.760]  Fed!
[01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:32.939]  Fed!
[01:55:33.439 --> 01:55:33.680]  Fed!
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:34.079]  Fed!
[01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:34.340]  Fed!
[01:55:34.779 --> 01:55:36.460]  Ms. Sandberg, was Ray Epps a Fed?
[01:55:37.579 --> 01:55:39.319]  Sir, I cannot answer that question.
[01:55:39.779 --> 01:55:41.399]  I'm the one who asked Merrick Garland.
[01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:43.979]  I showed him the tape of Ray Epps.
[01:55:44.119 --> 01:55:49.619]  I had to show it on an iPad for Merrick Garland to watch it, and then he refused to say how many Feds were there.
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:52.319]  I'm not going to comment on an investigation that's ongoing.
[01:55:53.069 --> 01:56:00.649]  Feds, agents of the federal government, were not just there, but were also encouraging people to riot or go into the Capitol.
[01:56:00.850 --> 01:56:01.850]  That's exactly right.
[01:56:02.010 --> 01:56:04.289]  Federal agents encouraged the violence that day.
[01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:11.109]  And the government is openly organized to physically go to war with the American people and provide the false flags as a pretext.
[01:56:11.229 --> 01:56:18.270]  And then our civilization will descend into something that makes civil war sound like a walk in the park.
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:43.119]  The involvement of certain actors, you could say deep state actors within the federal government, to set the stage for what happened in J4, 5, and 6, and to entrap thousands of Americans from across the country and lure them into this set stage.
[01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:47.840]  The people that were involved in that is quite a large web.
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:59.939]  You just said that elements within the federal government, I assume law enforcement, intel, and military, lured Americans to Washington into what you called a trap.
[01:57:00.159 --> 01:57:00.899]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:04.520]  And I assume that's a sober conclusion based on the evidence.
[01:57:04.539 --> 01:57:05.260]  That's what you're saying.
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:10.039]  That would be my sober assessment as an investigator.
[01:57:10.619 --> 01:57:17.899]  I love my country, and I've always been a staunch defender of the thin blue line.
[01:57:19.399 --> 01:57:22.439]  I would proudly count the FBI amongst that number.
[01:57:22.539 --> 01:57:23.800]  It was like brothers to me.
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:35.500]  So to find that level of conspiratorial corruption at the highest levels of the FBI has been very troubling to me as a man, as a cop.
[01:57:35.989 --> 01:57:56.750]  Those Americans were targeted by the FBI, almost universally Republicans and largely Trump supporters, but the FBI worked undercover to infiltrate those conversations and become a significant part of those individual Americans' communications.
[01:57:57.979 --> 01:58:14.000]  When you dig into the evidence that we've had revealed through some criminal cases that I've followed and worked with the families of J6 detainees and Americans that have been persecuted for their involvement in the Capitol that day,
[01:58:14.199 --> 01:58:32.010]  some of that evidence shockingly reveals that the FBI agents that were operating undercover Within the online groups across the country were the first ones to plant the seeds of suggestions of a more radical occupation of the Capitol.
[01:58:32.409 --> 01:58:48.529]  So, FBI had fingerprints on this thing for many months prior to J-4, 5, and 6. That is proof of entrapment because, of course, the federal government could have prevented entry into the Capitol Building.
[01:58:48.649 --> 01:58:49.310]  There aren't that many doors.
[01:58:49.569 --> 01:58:50.470]  You work there, you know.
[01:58:51.260 --> 01:58:54.119]  But they allowed people in on purpose to entrap them.
[01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:55.340]  That's what that proves, I think.
[01:58:55.619 --> 01:59:11.060]  The FBI assets that were dressed as Trump supporters that were inside the Capitol We're there, I believe, and evidence indicates that they were there to specifically wave in the Trump supporters that had gathered outside the Capitol,
[01:59:11.340 --> 01:59:13.779]  and the doors opened and they were allowed in.
[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:22.880]  On the inside were, oh, there's some more Trump supporters, but really those were FBI assets, law enforcement assets, that knew their way around the Capitol.
[01:59:23.079 --> 01:59:26.300]  They waved those guys in, said, come on, follow us.
[01:59:27.470 --> 01:59:28.750]  You have to have a guide.
[01:59:29.029 --> 01:59:37.710]  And on January 6th, the guides were FBI assets, the law enforcement assets, and they were dressed as Trump supporters.
[01:59:37.869 --> 02:00:06.289]  They were positioned inside the Capitol prior to the doors being opened so that the Americans that had assembled outside the Capitol, once allowed in, could be brought directly to areas where the FBI and the DOJ and the deep state actors knew Would be the most condemning criminal action of Americans being inside the Capitol protesting without permit and things.
[02:00:06.489 --> 02:00:11.130]  They knew it was setting the stage for arrest and prosecution.
[02:00:11.550 --> 02:00:24.079]  I'm not trying to create a crime to fit a narrative to blame on the FBI. I'm following the evidence, and to my horror, it implicates our FBI at the highest level.
[02:00:24.199 --> 02:00:39.880]  A conspiracy within our government at the highest level to set the stage for a compromised election cycle in 2020, and then the actions that took place on J-4, 5, and 6,
[02:00:40.020 --> 02:00:58.750]  and then the criminal investigation, arrest, and prosecution All Americans that they were able to entrap and document with the thousands of cameras that were operating that day, and use that evidence that they knew they were setting up to investigate,
[02:00:58.750 --> 02:01:01.890]  arrest, and prosecute the Americans that they had entrapped.
[02:01:02.189 --> 02:01:11.810]  So Congress can investigate these things, and we are, and we will reveal these horrific truths, and we will have criminal referrals.
[02:01:12.090 --> 02:01:34.560]  But until you have a president running the executive branch that will clean house at the DOJ and FBI at the highest levels and put American patriots in place that will act upon the criminal referrals that that Congress provides then none of those guys are going to get arrested because they're not going to arrest themselves.
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:53.149]  All right ladies and gentlemen let's Let's respond to that epic report from Alex, the Tim Pool rant, Clay Higgins, and everything we just saw.
[02:01:53.850 --> 02:01:59.989]  And keep in mind that I am a January 6th defendant.
[02:02:01.970 --> 02:02:07.529]  I was put in prison for my political speech.
[02:02:10.569 --> 02:02:14.869]  And obviously I know a lot of the behind the scenes stuff because I was directly involved.
[02:02:15.789 --> 02:02:17.050]  I talked to lawyers.
[02:02:18.090 --> 02:02:20.510]  I talked to other feds.
[02:02:20.630 --> 02:02:21.869]  I talked to DC police.
[02:02:22.329 --> 02:02:23.489]  We know what happened.
[02:02:23.689 --> 02:02:25.649]  We've got the entire thing.
[02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:37.250]  But let's start first with the Tim Pool rant where he mentions my case and he has that leftist there just stunned in disbelief.
[02:02:37.369 --> 02:02:38.970]  And let's start there.
[02:02:42.529 --> 02:02:44.250]  And let's give some other examples of this.
[02:02:45.770 --> 02:03:02.409]  I sat down, this same studio, this same show, with one of the Krasenstein brothers, a leftist, and he sat there straight-faced and said,
[02:03:02.529 --> 02:03:04.729]  the Hunter Biden laptop is fake.
[02:03:05.329 --> 02:03:10.630]  Sat there straight-faced and Said January 6th was an insurrection.
[02:03:10.630 --> 02:03:11.829]  Plot to overthrow the government.
[02:03:11.949 --> 02:03:13.090]  There was no federal involvement.
[02:03:14.869 --> 02:03:16.289]  So why do I bring that up?
[02:03:17.770 --> 02:03:25.770]  Because when you deal with these leftists, you realize rather quickly they don't live in reality.
[02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:28.289]  They don't do any research.
[02:03:28.289 --> 02:03:29.529]  They don't have any facts.
[02:03:29.890 --> 02:03:32.130]  They really don't know the real story at all.
[02:03:33.250 --> 02:03:41.850]  They take whatever propaganda that fits their beliefs, their narratives, their politics, and then they just regurgitate it and repeat it.
[02:03:42.090 --> 02:03:43.750]  And that's all they have.
[02:03:44.170 --> 02:03:50.810]  And when you actually come armed with facts and knowledge and logic, all they can do is sit there stunned in belief.
[02:03:51.850 --> 02:03:56.090]  And then repeat the same lie that every single time gets disproven.
[02:03:56.409 --> 02:03:58.069]  Every single time.
[02:04:00.670 --> 02:04:06.329]  Again, a Krasenstein brother on this show said the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation and not real.
[02:04:06.609 --> 02:04:08.850]  What else am I supposed to do except laugh in his face?
[02:04:10.250 --> 02:04:11.569]  These are not serious people.
[02:04:11.729 --> 02:04:12.630]  These are leftists.
[02:04:12.729 --> 02:04:13.170]  These are liberals.
[02:04:13.369 --> 02:04:24.949]  So the guy is just sitting there taking it from Tim Pool, doesn't even know what to say, because Tim obviously knows what he's talking about, and this leftist is just an authoritarian who wants to see his opposition locked up and killed.
[02:04:27.390 --> 02:04:28.170]  Damn the facts.
[02:04:28.329 --> 02:04:28.909]  Damn the evidence.
[02:04:29.050 --> 02:04:29.649]  Damn the research.
[02:04:29.810 --> 02:04:30.329]  Doesn't matter.
[02:04:30.550 --> 02:04:31.270]  Feels good to them.
[02:04:31.470 --> 02:04:33.609]  They love big government as long as they can control it.
[02:04:34.409 --> 02:04:36.449]  So you've got the ignorance of the leftist.
[02:04:37.329 --> 02:04:40.250]  And you have the arrogance of the leftist.
[02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:43.409]  And you have the authoritarianism of the leftist.
[02:04:43.550 --> 02:04:47.909]  And when you combine those three factors, that's why the left is so dangerous.
[02:04:49.909 --> 02:04:51.970]  But now let's talk about January 6th.
[02:04:54.109 --> 02:04:56.329]  They knew damn well what they were doing.
[02:04:57.489 --> 02:05:01.390]  The Democrats, the D.C. police, and the deep state.
[02:05:02.810 --> 02:05:13.649]  Donald Trump requested the National Guard, and it was rejected by the Democrat mayor of Washington, D.C., Mariel Bowser.
[02:05:13.890 --> 02:05:16.289]  She did not want the National Guard there that day.
[02:05:16.689 --> 02:05:18.130]  That was a stand-down.
[02:05:22.250 --> 02:05:23.630]  Capitol Police...
[02:05:25.460 --> 02:05:30.300]  Under the direction of the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was also stood down that day.
[02:05:31.090 --> 02:05:32.430]  They were supposed to have backup.
[02:05:32.649 --> 02:05:34.050]  They were supposed to have reinforcements.
[02:05:34.189 --> 02:05:35.569]  They were supposed to have increased numbers.
[02:05:36.109 --> 02:05:40.989]  Instead, Nancy Pelosi sent them home and said, no, we don't need extra support.
[02:05:41.289 --> 02:05:43.869]  Some inside actually wanted to get outside support.
[02:05:44.029 --> 02:05:45.109]  They wanted more support.
[02:05:45.250 --> 02:05:46.130]  They wanted more police.
[02:05:46.270 --> 02:05:47.270]  They wanted to be prepared.
[02:05:47.729 --> 02:05:49.869]  Nancy Pelosi stood down the Capitol Police.
[02:05:50.310 --> 02:05:53.130]  So Democrat Mariel Bowser stood down the National Guard.
[02:05:53.310 --> 02:05:56.189]  Democrat Nancy Pelosi stood down the Capitol Police.
[02:05:56.949 --> 02:05:58.529]  This is all on record.
[02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:05.220]  Not just from sources that I've interviewed on air, but also backed up by government documents.
[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:06.699]  It's all on the record.
[02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:14.680]  We've been saying for years that they had federal informants and agents on the ground.
[02:06:15.220 --> 02:06:21.939]  And there's a couple anomalies and names that stick out that people kind of point to and say, oh, is this proof?
[02:06:22.140 --> 02:06:23.659]  There's the famous scaffolding man.
[02:06:24.239 --> 02:06:27.100]  There's the situation with Ray Epps who denies it.
[02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:35.750]  Where he's on a list and then he's not and then he doesn't get charges even though he says go into the Capitol and then they do end up charging him months later even though this has already been known.
[02:06:39.130 --> 02:06:55.409]  But when you're involved in these cases and you talk to the lawyers of these defendants, you find out real quick that yes, there were definitely some form of federal agents involved Some form of federal informants on the ground that day,
[02:06:55.689 --> 02:06:57.189]  which they denied for years.
[02:06:57.449 --> 02:07:01.590]  Now it's public information, undercover agents, undercover police, all of it confirmed.
[02:07:01.770 --> 02:07:05.050]  And the numbers you're getting now are not going to be the final numbers.
[02:07:06.189 --> 02:07:07.350]  I promise you that.
[02:07:07.569 --> 02:07:08.850]  26 or a couple dozen?
[02:07:09.250 --> 02:07:09.770]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:07:10.449 --> 02:07:13.050]  When it's all said and done, you'll find out probably triple digits.
[02:07:13.310 --> 02:07:13.989]  Maybe more.
[02:07:15.289 --> 02:07:15.949]  Maybe more.
[02:07:17.789 --> 02:07:19.649]  Then there's the January 6th committee.
[02:07:21.399 --> 02:07:26.539]  That wasn't there to actually investigate what happened on January 6th.
[02:07:26.939 --> 02:07:35.239]  They were there to cement the narrative and then use it against Donald Trump so that he couldn't run for re-election.
[02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:39.140]  So they were not there to find out what really went on.
[02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:40.800]  They were there to lie to the American people.
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:42.979]  They were there to deceive the American people.
[02:07:43.159 --> 02:07:50.979]  The committee was run by Democrats to spin a narrative and then what they hoped would be Stop Donald Trump from running again.
[02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:53.000]  They couldn't pull it off.
[02:07:53.960 --> 02:07:58.539]  And then when Republicans won the House in 2022, they took over the January 6th committee.
[02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:06.699]  And on their way out the door, the Democrats or Liz Cheney or somebody else erased all the evidence.
[02:08:06.899 --> 02:08:08.359]  Now, they claim they didn't erase it.
[02:08:08.420 --> 02:08:12.640]  They claim it was some glitch or it got lost or a technical error, whatever.
[02:08:13.260 --> 02:08:14.819]  Does anybody really believe that?
[02:08:17.609 --> 02:08:22.789]  So now the incoming administration is saying, well, that's a crime if you deleted evidence.
[02:08:23.569 --> 02:08:25.310]  That's obstruction of justice.
[02:08:26.409 --> 02:08:30.430]  You need to be looking at criminal referrals for this.
[02:08:30.670 --> 02:08:31.729]  You need to be investigated.
[02:08:32.869 --> 02:08:50.029]  So they tried to put into the continued resolution bill that never even made the floor legal protection for the January 6th committee So that when they were subpoenaed or they were investigated or they were criminally referred,
[02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:58.989]  for whatever happened to all the evidence, whatever happened to the government documents, whatever happened to all the stuff that went out the door, they would get legal protection.
[02:09:00.029 --> 02:09:01.729]  A total admittance of guilt.
[02:09:02.529 --> 02:09:06.250]  They're calling up the Biden White House saying, give us a preemptive pardon.
[02:09:06.449 --> 02:09:07.970]  A total admittance of guilt.
[02:09:09.810 --> 02:09:11.250]  So what does it all lead up to?
[02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:16.539]  They didn't want there to be a review of the 2020 election because they know it was stolen.
[02:09:16.739 --> 02:09:20.199]  And now, after the 2024 results, what are Democrats saying?
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:23.159]  They're saying, where did all the votes go?
[02:09:24.260 --> 02:09:25.199]  Election fraud!
[02:09:25.439 --> 02:09:26.720]  Where did all the votes go?
[02:09:27.579 --> 02:09:29.340]  Oh yeah, you got it right, election fraud.
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:30.800]  You just got the wrong election.
[02:09:32.479 --> 02:09:34.359]  So it's all blowing up in their face.
[02:09:35.659 --> 02:09:43.949]  Serious people Are actually trying to get into the government and actually see some justice to the criminals coming out of D.C. And the Democrats are scared.
[02:09:44.409 --> 02:09:46.149]  They ran January 6th.
[02:09:47.670 --> 02:09:49.750]  They ran the election fraud.
[02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:55.949]  They likely committed crimes on their way out the door of the January 6th committee.
[02:09:57.810 --> 02:10:01.930]  And they're afraid that somebody serious might get in there and actually do something about it.
[02:10:04.649 --> 02:10:09.270]  But you try to explain any of this to a leftist and they sit there like a deer in the headlights.
[02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:11.050]  They have no clue what's going on.
[02:10:12.489 --> 02:10:22.970]  And based off of whoever has been writing these pardons for Joe Biden, blanket pardons need to be had day one from the Trump administration for all January 6th defendants.
[02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:27.869]  And the day they cry about, oh, this guy harassed a police officer, say, I thought you hated the police.
[02:10:27.970 --> 02:10:28.930]  I thought all cops were bad.
[02:10:29.090 --> 02:10:32.829]  What about the Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters that beat up police?
[02:10:32.989 --> 02:10:33.609]  Nothing on that.
[02:10:34.979 --> 02:10:37.380]  So now, that's what has to be done, day one.
[02:10:40.699 --> 02:10:43.819]  Alright, we're back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:10:43.819 --> 02:10:54.720]  I want to cover the rest of the headlines that I have on my desk for Jay Dyer set to take over for the fourth hour.
[02:10:54.819 --> 02:10:58.640]  We do have some geopolitical news today.
[02:11:03.450 --> 02:11:09.670]  Biden secretly moves troops to Syria.
[02:11:11.869 --> 02:11:14.029]  Secretly more than doubled U.S. troops in Syria.
[02:11:14.029 --> 02:11:17.829]  Now we were told it was 900. Then they came out and said it was 2,000.
[02:11:19.109 --> 02:11:30.970]  Listen to the Pentagon excuse in clip 7. As you know, we have been briefing you regularly that there are approximately 900 U.S. troops deployed to Syria.
[02:11:31.470 --> 02:11:40.229]  In light of the situation in Syria and the significant interest, we recently learned that those numbers were higher.
[02:11:40.390 --> 02:11:42.189]  And so, asked to look into it.
[02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:47.710]  I learned today That, in fact, there are approximately 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria.
[02:11:48.789 --> 02:12:02.310]  As I understand it, and as it was explained to me, these additional forces are considered temporary rotational forces that deploy to meet shifting mission requirements, whereas the core 900 deployers are on longer-term deployments.
[02:12:02.409 --> 02:12:07.189]  And as you know, for many of our deployments, numbers will fluctuate from time to time.
[02:12:07.630 --> 02:12:17.470]  But given that this number is significantly higher than what we've been briefing, I wanted to let you know as soon as I found out this information.
[02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:21.010]  Oh, we just recently learned we had these troops over there.
[02:12:21.329 --> 02:12:21.710]  Really?
[02:12:22.189 --> 02:12:23.989]  Again, is this incompetence?
[02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:24.750]  Are they lying?
[02:12:24.989 --> 02:12:26.069]  This is just pathetic.
[02:12:28.210 --> 02:12:29.489]  It's just pathetic.
[02:12:29.729 --> 02:12:31.210]  Now, there might be a purpose.
[02:12:32.529 --> 02:12:39.630]  U.S. officials travel to Syria in search of missing Americans meeting with rebel leaders.
[02:12:39.729 --> 02:12:42.550]  So these proxy groups run by the CIA or Mossad.
[02:12:44.529 --> 02:12:48.850]  That are now cutting deals with Israel and Turkey might be their resistance.
[02:12:50.829 --> 02:12:52.750]  So there's missing Americans in Syria.
[02:12:52.949 --> 02:12:54.329]  Is that why they're sending the troops there?
[02:12:55.890 --> 02:12:57.510]  So you got American hostages.
[02:12:57.829 --> 02:12:59.170]  You got missing Americans in Syria.
[02:12:59.470 --> 02:13:01.689]  And they just let the Biden administration off the hook.
[02:13:01.829 --> 02:13:03.329]  They just let John Kirby off the hook.
[02:13:03.649 --> 02:13:08.550]  They just let all of this administration off the hook.
[02:13:11.210 --> 02:13:17.630]  American hostages, missing Americans, all because of the horrible foreign policy of this administration.
[02:13:17.649 --> 02:13:19.489]  And there's just no pressure at all.
[02:13:19.630 --> 02:13:20.529]  Nobody blames Biden.
[02:13:20.689 --> 02:13:21.949]  Nobody blames the Biden administration.
[02:13:22.170 --> 02:13:23.890]  Missing Americans, hostage Americans.
[02:13:24.149 --> 02:13:26.510]  No, we're just not going to talk about that.
[02:13:27.329 --> 02:13:29.090]  As Biden doesn't even know where he is.
[02:13:29.229 --> 02:13:35.029]  They're doing the Christmas event at the White House and he's trying to grab kids and force them onto his lap.
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:42.960]  Russia scrambles to reinforce Libya bases after collapse of Assad regime.
[02:13:43.619 --> 02:13:49.000]  Russia withdraws air defense systems, other advanced weapons from Syria, and they're going to try to move him into Libya.
[02:13:50.039 --> 02:13:57.279]  Which, of course, is ironic because, you know, that was Hillary Clinton's big victory, was the collapse of Libya.
[02:13:58.539 --> 02:14:00.079]  The killing of Gaddafi.
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:04.260]  That was a huge victory for Hillary Clinton, her State Department, and the corrupt...
[02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:06.119]  Military-industrial complex.
[02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:08.779]  And now they're going to end up losing it to Russia, it looks like.
[02:14:08.859 --> 02:14:09.640]  So that's fun.
[02:14:10.239 --> 02:14:11.539]  But that's just how it goes.
[02:14:11.659 --> 02:14:12.939]  They get their big money grab.
[02:14:13.180 --> 02:14:16.000]  They get their weapons contractors paid.
[02:14:16.119 --> 02:14:17.239]  Their stock options increase.
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:21.380]  And then every four years or so, they do more regime change and just repeat the cycle.
[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:22.960]  Just rinse, wash, repeat.
[02:14:23.060 --> 02:14:24.060]  Same thing will happen in Syria.
[02:14:27.039 --> 02:14:32.819]  Russia detains Uzbek citizen as suspect in Moscow bombing that killed General...
[02:14:33.859 --> 02:14:42.619]  And I believe it was also Uzbekistan that blamed these Uzbekistan nationals for the mass shooting in Moscow.
[02:14:45.279 --> 02:15:00.539]  So it looks like the CIA groups, the State Department groups, are operating out of Uzbekistan for Ukraine, trying to sneak them into Moscow.
[02:15:02.449 --> 02:15:04.890]  Is what it would appear is happening there.
[02:15:06.989 --> 02:15:13.210]  Israel media report accuses troops of indiscriminate killing of Gaza civilians.
[02:15:15.689 --> 02:15:16.989]  Yeah, no kidding.
[02:15:16.989 --> 02:15:24.170]  Most of it's on video and then they kick the journalists out and then they ban drones so you can't see what's going on.
[02:15:27.789 --> 02:15:31.850]  Thousands of Jews have left Israel since the October 7th attacks.
[02:15:31.869 --> 02:15:35.350]  Remember how they were saying that they're all going in, they're all going in, and they were showing you those airplanes?
[02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:36.510]  Yeah, actually, they were all leaving.
[02:15:37.930 --> 02:15:40.109]  And this is the angle that they don't really tell you.
[02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:55.109]  Lots of people are leaving Israel, not just for safety reasons, but for economic reasons, and they don't like what the IDF and what Netanyahu is doing, putting the nation at risk, putting Israel standing on the global stage at risk.
[02:15:56.869 --> 02:16:07.069]  But of course, as you know, your politicians and your media, they will always be pro-Israel despite what the international community is saying or what's actually happening on the ground.
[02:16:08.430 --> 02:16:09.869]  And you know, it's funny too.
[02:16:10.850 --> 02:16:12.890]  It's just like...
[02:16:12.890 --> 02:16:29.159]  You have these powder kegs of ratings like Candace Owens or Dan Bilzerian and they'll just go discuss geopolitics On shows like Piers Morgan or the Jake Shields podcast.
[02:16:31.199 --> 02:16:33.500]  And then immediately, it's always the same.
[02:16:34.399 --> 02:16:35.579]  It's always the same.
[02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:39.500]  All these people come out and attack them and, oh, they're anti-Semites.
[02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:45.139]  Insult them, call them names, and they never address what they're actually talking about.
[02:16:45.559 --> 02:16:48.059]  It's like, you can't even just talk geopolitics.
[02:16:48.459 --> 02:16:53.319]  Tucker Carlson had a survivor of the USS Liberty.
[02:16:54.309 --> 02:16:59.110]  Or no, Candace Owens had a survivor of the USS Liberty, and they just discount him.
[02:16:59.229 --> 02:17:00.069]  His opinion doesn't count.
[02:17:00.290 --> 02:17:00.809]  He was just there.
[02:17:00.909 --> 02:17:01.489]  He just lived it.
[02:17:02.690 --> 02:17:09.510]  Tucker Carlson has a guy talking about the history of Israel and just geopolitics and history, and then, oh, now Tucker Carlson's an anti-Semite.
[02:17:10.889 --> 02:17:13.170]  It's like, why can't you just talk geopolitics?
[02:17:13.170 --> 02:17:14.409]  Why can't you just talk foreign affairs?
[02:17:14.549 --> 02:17:21.370]  Why can't you just talk Middle East developments without these people just insulting you and name-calling you en masse?
[02:17:23.059 --> 02:17:26.479]  It's not really helping your arguments either.
[02:17:26.540 --> 02:17:30.040]  It's actually making you look worse and weak.
[02:17:31.219 --> 02:17:32.520]  Israel versus Turkey.
[02:17:32.639 --> 02:17:34.340]  The intensifying Middle East power struggle.
[02:17:34.459 --> 02:17:36.600]  So it looks like that's what's going to be happening in Syria now.
[02:17:37.239 --> 02:17:41.139]  Now, the Assad regime was toppled.
[02:17:41.979 --> 02:17:43.479]  Looks like deals were cut.
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:45.899]  And Assad had no choice but to leave.
[02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:51.020]  He basically got thrown out by his own people, overthrown by his own people.
[02:17:52.879 --> 02:18:11.459]  And so the Western-backed proxy groups ran it, overthrew the regime, brought in their moderate rebel groups, all funded by the West, being operated by Mossad, being funded with all the money and weapons that are coming in through Ukraine.
[02:18:12.379 --> 02:18:16.219]  And then they cut a deal with Israel to give Israel land.
[02:18:16.219 --> 02:18:21.100]  They take over Syria, and now Turkey is coming in and trying to fill the power void.
[02:18:22.329 --> 02:18:28.270]  Now that Syria has fallen and the Assad regime is over.
[02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:45.790]  So it's this giant power play of Israel versus Turkey and then the West military-industrial complex intelligence groups Proxy armies are kind of just always involved in all of this stuff,
[02:18:45.930 --> 02:18:47.149]  and then every four years.
[02:18:47.290 --> 02:18:52.489]  So there'll probably be another regime change in Syria in four years, and it'll be the same players, same people getting paid.
[02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:58.329]  It always goes that way, except when Trump gets into office.
[02:18:58.450 --> 02:19:00.250]  But they had to do all of this before Trump got in.
[02:19:02.209 --> 02:19:08.090]  Irish politicians refuse to remain silent about Israel's genocide in Gaza after being called anti-Semitic.
[02:19:08.149 --> 02:19:09.329]  Well, that's the big trick, don't you know?
[02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:13.350]  You say anything negative about Israel, then you just get called anti-Semitic.
[02:19:13.489 --> 02:19:20.909]  You talk about the history of Israel, or you talk about USS Liberty, or you talk about what's going on on October 7th or after.
[02:19:21.069 --> 02:19:22.409]  It's just, you're anti-Semitic.
[02:19:22.489 --> 02:19:23.409]  Well, let's have a debate on it.
[02:19:23.469 --> 02:19:24.750]  No, I don't talk to anti-Semites.
[02:19:25.930 --> 02:19:26.569]  Oh, okay.
[02:19:29.969 --> 02:19:33.209]  So there's your update on the geopolitical news.
[02:19:33.409 --> 02:19:36.530]  Then you have illegal immigrants.
[02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:37.629]  Now, the Mexican...
[02:19:39.340 --> 02:19:44.319]  President Scheinbaum says she is ready to receive Mexicans deported by Donald Trump.
[02:19:44.979 --> 02:19:54.100]  So Trump's tariff policy, trade policy, is already having positive results in multiple sections here when it comes to dealing.
[02:19:54.260 --> 02:19:56.479]  By the way, ICE is already starting to deport people.
[02:19:56.639 --> 02:19:57.459]  Confidence is up.
[02:19:58.579 --> 02:19:59.440]  Deportations are up.
[02:19:59.780 --> 02:20:01.500]  Some of them are turning themselves in.
[02:20:01.540 --> 02:20:02.239]  They want to be deported.
[02:20:03.959 --> 02:20:05.139]  And then you have...
[02:20:05.940 --> 02:20:15.319]  The leftist groups that are funding these protests, maybe they even want to start riots with these non-citizens, but they've got some of these protests started.
[02:20:15.659 --> 02:20:27.079]  Look at what they're doing here in clip 18. Hundreds of pro-migrant protesters outside the ICE federal detention center in downtown LA demanding...
[02:20:27.079 --> 02:20:29.760]  A sanctuary ordinance in every city.
[02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:35.280]  ...wearing shirts and holding signs against President-elect Donald Trump's plans for deportations.
[02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:38.399]  Let them know that we're going to mobilize and we're going to fight.
[02:20:38.559 --> 02:20:42.760]  On day one, I will launch the largest deportation program of criminals.
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:45.559]  Trump's inauguration now just one month away.
[02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:48.110]  There's a lot of uncertainty and a lot of fear in the community.
[02:20:48.329 --> 02:20:52.829]  For Martinez Zaragoza here from San Jose for International Migrants Day.
[02:20:53.090 --> 02:20:54.209]  What's your main goal today?
[02:20:54.549 --> 02:20:59.930]  To stand in solidarity, but also as somebody undocumented, somebody with DACA, my own rights are at risk.
[02:21:00.069 --> 02:21:02.110]  I am not afraid, but I know a lot of people that are.
[02:21:02.370 --> 02:21:05.430]  And it's just here to show them that they're not alone and that there's people fighting back.
[02:21:07.930 --> 02:21:08.290]  Bye.
[02:21:10.850 --> 02:21:16.479]  So look, you're going to see a lot of this I don't really think they'll get violent.
[02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:17.899]  The left would love them to get violent.
[02:21:18.579 --> 02:21:19.920]  I don't really think they will.
[02:21:21.379 --> 02:21:22.639]  It's kind of all of a bluff.
[02:21:22.799 --> 02:21:23.879]  Oh, I'll stand there.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:25.360]  I'll stop the deportations.
[02:21:26.479 --> 02:21:32.139]  They're going to get all these AstroTurf protests, but I don't think it's going to change anything.
[02:21:35.340 --> 02:21:37.180]  20 million under Joe Biden.
[02:21:38.379 --> 02:21:39.079]  20 million.
[02:21:42.569 --> 02:21:44.590]  20 million illegal immigrants.
[02:21:47.489 --> 02:21:49.590]  And they've all been put on welfare.
[02:21:54.350 --> 02:21:56.590]  So, yeah, what do you expect?
[02:21:56.610 --> 02:22:01.329]  You give people free stuff and then you take it away.
[02:22:01.389 --> 02:22:03.370]  There's going to be some problems.
[02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:11.790]  But so now the left is funding protests so that these people can go out and protest The fact that we want to have secure borders and deport illegal immigrants.
[02:22:12.450 --> 02:22:14.290]  And then you got the stories like this.
[02:22:16.069 --> 02:22:17.469]  It just never ends.
[02:22:17.690 --> 02:22:18.729]  It just never ends.
[02:22:18.850 --> 02:22:30.040]  Clip 19. We say that a man in the country illegally has been charged with child sex crimes in an Eastern Carolina county.
[02:22:30.319 --> 02:22:41.659]  On Wednesday, detectives with the Carteret County Sheriff's Office arrested 27-year-old Nestor Anhal Anhal of Newport for enticing a child to send nude photos over social media for money.
[02:22:42.049 --> 02:22:46.670]  Deputies also say that evidence show that Angel had sexually abused a child.
[02:22:46.870 --> 02:22:52.010]  He is charged with indecent liberties with the child and disseminating obscenities, both felonies.
[02:22:52.149 --> 02:22:55.409]  He's being held on a $150,000 secured bond.
[02:22:55.629 --> 02:23:03.090]  Additionally, deputies say that ICE has issued a detainer and Angel will be transferred to their custody once his court case is finished.
[02:23:03.350 --> 02:23:07.090]  Deputies say additional charges are expected in this ongoing investigation.
[02:23:08.059 --> 02:23:13.459]  And a lot of these child-abusing illegal immigrants get released from jail by liberal DA's.
[02:23:14.659 --> 02:23:17.180]  All funded by the U.S. taxpayer.
[02:23:17.420 --> 02:23:18.799]  It's just completely out of control.
[02:23:19.700 --> 02:23:23.200]  We should have zero tolerance for this and we need to stop it now.
[02:23:23.299 --> 02:23:31.340]  And the only way to do that is to hold those responsible who brought them in, funded their travel, and funded their housing.
[02:23:31.479 --> 02:23:47.469]  Anybody, an NGO, a policy maker, Who funded the housing, facilitated the housing, funded and facilitated the travel of any criminal that's committed, any illegal alien criminal that's committed a crime,
[02:23:47.469 --> 02:23:51.729]  they also need to be charged as well with aiding and abetting and whatever crime that is.
[02:23:51.809 --> 02:23:53.209]  And this will stop immediately.
[02:23:54.350 --> 02:23:56.069]  It will stop immediately.
[02:23:58.709 --> 02:24:02.729]  Alright, why does the U.S. government want you unhealthy?
[02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:06.819]  And RFK Jr. are hopefully going to take care of some of this.
[02:24:06.899 --> 02:24:08.360]  Why does the U.S. government want you unhealthy?
[02:24:08.860 --> 02:24:10.520]  No one has to be healthy.
[02:24:10.719 --> 02:24:16.159]  San Francisco taps fat activist as weight stigma czar.
[02:24:16.799 --> 02:24:21.459]  And this woman is about as unhealthy looking as you could possibly be.
[02:24:22.139 --> 02:24:23.379]  But you need to have that.
[02:24:23.479 --> 02:24:24.280]  You need to promote that.
[02:24:24.399 --> 02:24:25.459]  We need to promote obesity.
[02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:28.280]  Instead of saying, hey...
[02:24:29.700 --> 02:24:30.959]  You know, you're unhealthy.
[02:24:30.959 --> 02:24:33.059]  Because this is what the doctors would used to say to you.
[02:24:33.700 --> 02:24:38.040]  You know, you're putting your health at risk.
[02:24:39.299 --> 02:24:42.600]  You're setting yourself up for a shorter lifespan than you should.
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:45.219]  And some major health complications.
[02:24:45.219 --> 02:24:48.180]  You might want to lose some weight and change your diet.
[02:24:48.319 --> 02:24:50.620]  No, now it's, oh, you're fat and obese.
[02:24:50.780 --> 02:24:51.799]  So, hey, that's great.
[02:24:51.799 --> 02:24:52.680]  That's empowering.
[02:24:52.879 --> 02:24:54.500]  Don't let anyone tell you how to live.
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:25:03.280]  Go have a donut or 10. And they promote these new positions, weight stigmas are.
[02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:04.299]  It's not a stigma.
[02:25:05.579 --> 02:25:06.819]  What happened to science?
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:08.120]  What happened to believe the science?
[02:25:08.299 --> 02:25:15.299]  It's not a stigma that if you're 100 pounds overweight and obese, that you're going to have health problems.
[02:25:15.579 --> 02:25:16.940]  Okay, that is a fake photo.
[02:25:16.940 --> 02:25:18.180]  That is not even funny.
[02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:18.959]  No, yeah, okay.
[02:25:19.379 --> 02:25:21.479]  That's me with my girlfriend Shamu.
[02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:25.379]  That is just, this crew is just sick.
[02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:26.360]  They're sick people.
[02:25:26.459 --> 02:25:27.680]  We have sick people in this crew.
[02:25:29.719 --> 02:25:34.219]  Putting my face snuggling up next to Shamu.
[02:25:34.219 --> 02:25:36.540]  The weight stigmas are...
[02:25:36.540 --> 02:25:43.899]  Oh my gosh.
[02:25:44.180 --> 02:25:45.180]  It's ridiculous.
[02:25:45.579 --> 02:25:49.079]  You try to host a show and your crew undermines you.
[02:25:49.239 --> 02:25:51.440]  Right there, live on air for all to see.
[02:25:52.959 --> 02:25:53.540]  Unbelievable.
[02:25:55.809 --> 02:26:00.530]  No, I was not pictured with Shamu, the weight stigmas are, in gay pride socks.
[02:26:00.709 --> 02:26:01.170]  Sorry.
[02:26:01.950 --> 02:26:03.469]  Sorry to let you down, folks.
[02:26:03.809 --> 02:26:08.229]  But hey, that's the new doctor's advice.
[02:26:08.229 --> 02:26:11.709]  Oh yeah, you're 150 pounds overweight and your heart can barely beat.
[02:26:11.889 --> 02:26:13.510]  So, great job.
[02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:15.409]  Yeah, I'm not going to tell you to lose weight.
[02:26:16.709 --> 02:26:21.569]  And then they want to attack all the options that you have out there.
[02:26:24.430 --> 02:26:36.229]  The FDA, under orders from the Biden regime and big pharma lobbyists, released a threatening letter to low-cost, fully safe, and compound GLP-1 peptides.
[02:26:36.350 --> 02:26:42.030]  They want to force patients on overly expensive, patented drugs.
[02:26:45.090 --> 02:26:49.389]  FDA, knockoff versions of Lilly obesity drug must come off the market.
[02:26:50.549 --> 02:26:57.159]  FDA finalized decision to end Lilly's GLP-1.
[02:26:59.559 --> 02:27:02.639]  So, it's well known about peptides.
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:06.639]  Anybody that's looked into peptides, all kinds of great benefits there.
[02:27:06.739 --> 02:27:07.319]  But no, no, no, no.
[02:27:07.379 --> 02:27:11.600]  We don't want cheap options, just like we don't want hydroxychloroquine, just like we don't want ivermectin.
[02:27:11.899 --> 02:27:20.780]  You have to go buy, whichever pharmaceutical lobbyist spends the most money in D.C., you have to go buy their drugs.
[02:27:22.459 --> 02:27:25.680]  That's what you have to do, is buy their drugs, okay?
[02:27:27.540 --> 02:27:29.319]  Have you been able to get your Amazon packages?
[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:33.479]  Because there is a massive Amazon strike, and apparently growing.
[02:27:34.559 --> 02:27:42.500]  Amazon suffers Christmas blow as 10,000 workers walk off the job at worst possible time.
[02:27:43.579 --> 02:27:49.920]  It is hitting New York, Atlanta, Southern California, San Francisco, and Skokie, Illinois.
[02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:55.819]  It's also apparently gone global, and they're threatening other cities will strike as well.
[02:27:58.069 --> 02:28:05.409]  Teamsters say momentum continues as Christmas time strikes against Amazon enters day two.
[02:28:05.590 --> 02:28:07.649]  Well, this could be the flavor of the season.
[02:28:08.450 --> 02:28:09.909]  Shut down the government.
[02:28:10.190 --> 02:28:11.629]  Amazon workers go on strike.
[02:28:11.629 --> 02:28:12.430]  What's next?
[02:28:15.290 --> 02:28:20.389]  You already have all the fat, liberal, purple-haired woman on a sex strike.
[02:28:20.909 --> 02:28:24.790]  Of course, this changes nothing, but they said it.
[02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:27.940]  It's the season of strikes.
[02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:33.719]  Obese, liberal, blue-haired women are still not having sex, but it's a sex strike.
[02:28:36.979 --> 02:28:38.520]  Amazon workers are striking.
[02:28:38.680 --> 02:28:39.940]  The government's going to be shut down.
[02:28:39.940 --> 02:28:41.739]  It's the season of the shutdown.
[02:28:43.139 --> 02:28:46.659]  You know, I would like to see some action here.
[02:28:48.879 --> 02:28:56.139]  House weaponization panel releases 17,000-page report exposing two-tiered system of government.
[02:28:57.620 --> 02:29:02.559]  The subcommittee says it took important steps to ensure that the federal government no longer works against the American people.
[02:29:02.659 --> 02:29:07.079]  Representative Jim Jordan calls confidential human source a fancy name for spy.
[02:29:07.219 --> 02:29:09.680]  That's about the January 6th riot.
[02:29:10.079 --> 02:29:13.879]  So we hear all about this, but we never see any action.
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.020]  We never see any criminal referrals or anything else.
[02:29:16.159 --> 02:29:22.219]  I hope that changes in the next Congress because this is getting to be ridiculous.
[02:29:24.239 --> 02:29:26.319]  It's beginning to get ridiculous.
[02:29:28.079 --> 02:29:34.379]  And I wonder if this has anything to do with Catherine Herridge, a very well-respected journalist.
[02:29:34.639 --> 02:29:43.600]  She's teasing a new story here in clip 16. Some stories are just difficult to report.
[02:29:44.020 --> 02:29:55.260]  This story about attacks on our intelligence, military, and State Department personnel, I've really been picking up on and off for maybe four, five, six years.
[02:29:58.899 --> 02:30:02.440]  The working title for this project right now is government gaslighting.
[02:30:02.559 --> 02:30:07.719]  That is what the U.S. intelligence community and the CIA has been doing to injured personnel.
[02:30:09.540 --> 02:30:14.520]  And it's more than a dozen countries across the globe where these events have happened.
[02:30:14.780 --> 02:30:16.879]  There are these common threads.
[02:30:17.079 --> 02:30:19.860]  They're common threads of the type of injuries they're having.
[02:30:22.270 --> 02:30:29.870]  The evidence is building and it appears likely that a foreign adversary is behind these attacks.
[02:30:31.950 --> 02:30:39.670]  This is a highly vetted group and they're trusted with some of the U.S. government's most closely held secrets.
[02:30:41.909 --> 02:30:49.670]  And if you acknowledge that U.S. government personnel are being targeted overseas while on assignment, it sends the message that nobody is safe.
[02:30:51.090 --> 02:30:53.850]  Well, yeah, nobody's safe when your own government hates you.
[02:30:54.069 --> 02:30:55.670]  Your own government attacks you.
[02:30:55.889 --> 02:30:58.209]  You think they care if a foreign adversary attacks you?
[02:30:58.350 --> 02:30:59.469]  They probably like it.
[02:31:00.629 --> 02:31:02.489]  Your own government doesn't like you.
[02:31:02.610 --> 02:31:04.309]  So why would they care if someone else attacks you?
[02:31:04.370 --> 02:31:05.549]  They'd probably endorse it.
[02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:06.530]  Give them the green light.
[02:31:08.510 --> 02:31:09.110]  All right.
[02:31:10.020 --> 02:31:10.879]  Should we have a laugh?
[02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:12.159]  Have you ever seen...
[02:31:12.159 --> 02:31:14.500]  When was the last time you saw Brian Stelter?
[02:31:14.579 --> 02:31:15.280]  You know, he's back.
[02:31:15.420 --> 02:31:17.979]  Somehow he got back at CNN. And then Jim Acosta.
[02:31:18.219 --> 02:31:19.280]  The crying session.
[02:31:19.879 --> 02:31:23.500]  We should probably send them a lifetime supply of Kleenexes.
[02:31:23.500 --> 02:31:26.120]  They're going to need them for the next four years with Trump in office.
[02:31:27.420 --> 02:31:28.420]  They're really upset.
[02:31:28.799 --> 02:31:35.479]  They're really upset that the Democrats couldn't get their bill passed and that we the people with Donald Trump and Elon Musk helped stop it.
[02:31:35.559 --> 02:31:36.600]  Here they are crying about it.
[02:31:36.659 --> 02:31:39.809]  Clip 17. Fresh and innovative ideas.
[02:31:40.010 --> 02:31:41.989]  That is a part of what makes government better.
[02:31:42.190 --> 02:31:50.069]  But Musk, this unelected figure who has this enormous amount of power, it sometimes seems as if he's just starting to learn how the government functions.
[02:31:50.350 --> 02:31:52.010]  Hold on.
[02:31:52.170 --> 02:31:52.510]  Pause it.
[02:31:52.770 --> 02:31:53.090]  Pause it.
[02:31:53.389 --> 02:31:53.829]  Unelected?
[02:31:53.930 --> 02:31:59.930]  How many votes did Kamala receive to become the Democrat nominee again?
[02:32:00.090 --> 02:32:00.889]  Okay, just checking.
[02:32:01.030 --> 02:32:01.649]  Go ahead, coffee boy.
[02:32:03.450 --> 02:32:05.829]  And by the way, it's not just me saying it.
[02:32:06.110 --> 02:32:17.510]  Representative Dan Crenshaw, a Republican lawmaker, tweeted to Musk last night and said, I love you, Elon, but you need to take five seconds to check your sources before highlighting bottom feeders looking for clicks.
[02:32:17.950 --> 02:32:21.450]  You know, Musk likes to post anonymous accounts that are spreading misinformation.
[02:32:22.030 --> 02:32:25.110]  And let's recognize, a lot of people have benefited from Musk.
[02:32:25.270 --> 02:32:27.510]  You know, the Tesla stock has been on a tear lately.
[02:32:27.729 --> 02:32:29.530]  Lots of CEOs going to Mar-a-Lago.
[02:32:29.530 --> 02:32:36.649]  They're probably jealous of Musk right now, both because of his relationship to Trump and because of the performance of Tesla and Musk's other companies.
[02:32:36.649 --> 02:32:39.409]  So there's a lot Musk can bring to government.
[02:32:39.530 --> 02:32:46.850]  But his behavior on X and his influence over the spending bill, it also shows how misinformation is at work here, Jim.
[02:32:47.020 --> 02:32:49.819]  Yeah, I mean, for all the talk of calling people fake news and so on.
[02:32:49.920 --> 02:32:50.059]  Misinformation.
[02:32:50.219 --> 02:32:50.899]  All right.
[02:32:51.100 --> 02:32:51.440]  All right.
[02:32:51.520 --> 02:32:53.639]  Let's get those two clowns off the screen there.
[02:32:55.159 --> 02:32:55.979]  They're back.
[02:32:56.340 --> 02:32:57.340]  Oh, yes!
[02:32:58.219 --> 02:33:01.479]  Stelter Acosta in the age of Trump round two.
[02:33:01.739 --> 02:33:02.159]  Get ready.
[02:33:02.280 --> 02:33:03.219]  That's going to be fun.
[02:33:03.459 --> 02:33:04.360]  That is going to be fun.
[02:33:04.559 --> 02:33:04.739]  All right.
[02:33:04.840 --> 02:33:05.940]  Jay Dyer is about to take over.
[02:33:06.079 --> 02:33:12.899]  Folks, I've just been told at thealexjonesstore.com we are almost out of optimal human drink mix.
[02:33:13.900 --> 02:33:14.700]  Very popular.
[02:33:14.959 --> 02:33:15.719]  The crew loves it.
[02:33:15.799 --> 02:33:17.000]  They talk about it all the time.
[02:33:17.139 --> 02:33:18.139]  They're drinking it here at work.
