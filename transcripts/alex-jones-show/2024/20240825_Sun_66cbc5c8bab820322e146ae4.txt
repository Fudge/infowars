[00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:17.569]  Listen to this.
[00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.011]  325,000 migrant children are gone.
[00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:20.852]  They're missing.
[00:00:25.074 --> 00:00:28.015]  She allowed them to be trafficked into our country.
[00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:33.937]  Many of these children are now in sex slavery or they're dead.
[00:00:34.737 --> 00:00:36.178]  Probably mostly dead.
[00:00:36.798 --> 00:00:40.099]  They will never see their homes or their parents again.
[00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:41.960]  They were swiped out of their homes.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.921]  They were taken out of their homes.
[00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:48.602]  300, this is a government number, 325,000 children.
[00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:53.802]  Sex slaves or they're dead.
[00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:55.242]  Many are dead.
[00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:00.824]  It's Sunday, August 25th, 2024.
[00:01:01.324 --> 00:01:06.165]  And Robert F. Kennedy's endorsement of Trump has sent shockwaves through the political spectrum.
[00:01:06.485 --> 00:01:07.305]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:01:10.886 --> 00:01:15.047]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:01:16.648 --> 00:01:20.729]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[00:01:21.758 --> 00:01:27.421]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:29.682]  71 days, the most important election in world history.
[00:01:29.762 --> 00:01:42.167]  But if you add together the 76 days that comes after that in the countdown when President Trump is president-elect, it's 147 days, 18 hours 59 minutes.
[00:01:42.187 --> 00:01:49.671]  I am very honored to be here with you tonight.
[00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:55.371]  That was an incredible speech in Arizona Friday with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:01:55.851 --> 00:02:02.780]  fully endorsing Trump and going on the campaign trail with him and now hitting national television and major podcasts in the last 48 hours.
[00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:08.187]  Massive, massive, incredible developments, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:09.952 --> 00:02:10.292]  All right.
[00:02:10.753 --> 00:02:14.436]  We're going to go through all of the news in the next two hours, most of it.
[00:02:14.456 --> 00:02:16.198]  A lot of stuff's breaking as we speak.
[00:02:16.858 --> 00:02:19.761]  And then Chase Geyser is coming in 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:02:19.821 --> 00:02:25.265]  Central for Sunday Night Live for another two hours of live transmission.
[00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:32.852]  I decided to shave my head again for the last stretch of the campaign, get in the Spartan mode here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:33.793 --> 00:02:34.494]  So here we are.
[00:02:35.706 --> 00:02:35.987]  Wow.
[00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:45.325]  Look, any way you slice it, Kennedy, Tulsi Gabbard, all these real, respected, non-communist Democrats endorsing Trump,
[00:02:46.215 --> 00:02:55.802]  is just seismic and it just pokes more holes in the fraud that is Kamala Harris and Tim Walz and the fact that they stole the election almost four years ago.
[00:02:56.242 --> 00:03:04.968]  They've been gaslighting us ever since and running the country into the ground and lying about jobless numbers and totally opening the border and saying Kamala Harris is what the borders are.
[00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:05.848]  It's just insane.
[00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.570]  We're going to be hitting all of that tonight.
[00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.954]  How illegal aliens in their own policies are to be given free health care
[00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:31.426]  So this is a very, very dangerous moment for the country and the world.
[00:03:31.486 --> 00:03:34.687]  This is how they plan to bring in a group that can outvote the citizens.
[00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:36.007]  It is pure treason.
[00:03:36.527 --> 00:03:37.468]  And this is on top of it.
[00:03:37.488 --> 00:03:41.949]  Students left without bus service as Massachusetts funds buses for illegals.
[00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:43.929]  That on top of
[00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:50.166]  Kamala Harris and her co-chair Whitmer saying illegals should get everything free.
[00:03:50.626 --> 00:03:54.470]  California moves towards zero down payment mortgages for illegal immigrants, not for citizens.
[00:03:57.393 --> 00:04:02.898]  The western state where migrants, that's Oregon, get 30,000 homebuyer grants, but citizens are excluded.
[00:04:02.918 --> 00:04:03.879]  30,000 free bucks.
[00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.011]  This is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:09.992]  Meanwhile, horror!
[00:04:10.052 --> 00:04:15.795]  Military parents lose custody of 16-year-old autistic son after refusing to let him transition to a girl.
[00:04:16.295 --> 00:04:25.620]  Son is currently in foster care, living with non-gendered chaplain named Lavander.
[00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:31.624]  Yep, they get the mentally ill, the retarded children, and they sterilize them.
[00:04:32.344 --> 00:04:35.726]  Can't sign up to the military, can't buy liquor, can't buy cigarettes, but
[00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:39.297]  In the UK, they're trying to cut six-year-old's penises off.
[00:04:39.337 --> 00:04:40.157]  Here, it's age seven.
[00:04:41.118 --> 00:04:41.618]  Unbelievable.
[00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.141]  Anti-Trump pollster Frank Luntz says RFK Jr.
[00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:47.702]  endorsement could make the difference and propel Trump to victory.
[00:04:48.483 --> 00:04:53.987]  Trump's already way ahead, but they have a baked-in margin of fraud of 10%, according to all the research experts and myself have done.
[00:04:54.967 --> 00:05:02.953]  This added six to 12 points, depending on how you look at it, depending on how people vote, will devastate them, and they are just in total panic mode.
[00:05:03.413 --> 00:05:04.414]  This means they will try
[00:05:05.694 --> 00:05:08.278]  To kill Trump now, more than ever.
[00:05:08.578 --> 00:05:09.860]  And they're going to come out with a free speech.
[00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:19.976]  When you see the founder and head of the popular Twitter-style site Telegram, Pavel Durov, arrested yesterday.
[00:05:20.865 --> 00:05:27.027]  When he landed in France, you know that's the model for everybody else, and the main target's Elon Musk.
[00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:30.168]  That's coming up and more today.
[00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:31.148]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:31.648 --> 00:05:38.010]  Follow me on X at RealAlexJones and at m4wars.com forward slash show as well as band dot video.
[00:05:57.734 --> 00:06:00.857]  Well, when you've got R.F.K.
[00:06:00.897 --> 00:06:20.412]  Jr., Tulsi Gabbards, Elon Musk, and so many other prominent, top former Democrats coming out and saying the Democratic Party is a criminal mafia that is endangering not just America, but the world of World War III, and working with Big Pharma and Big Food to poison our children.
[00:06:20.432 --> 00:06:26.597]  When you've got Kennedy saying we've got to come together because we love our children more than we love to hate each other.
[00:06:27.625 --> 00:06:30.487]  The globalists have got a big, big problem.
[00:06:31.427 --> 00:06:34.009]  And they are absolutely up against the wall.
[00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:36.630]  They are the cornered rats that they are.
[00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:40.132]  And with only, what, how many days left of the election?
[00:06:40.152 --> 00:06:40.132]  72?
[00:06:40.172 --> 00:06:42.313]  73?
[00:06:40.192 --> 00:06:42.313]  Let's put it up on screen.
[00:06:44.014 --> 00:06:46.015]  They are going to create black swan events.
[00:06:46.075 --> 00:06:49.297]  They are going to try to create 71 days.
[00:06:50.698 --> 00:06:54.100]  All sorts of crises and false flags, if they can pull it off.
[00:06:55.128 --> 00:06:56.950]  They're trying to scare us back under their control.
[00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:05.679]  They're going to try to manipulate Russia into expanding the war, as they've been doing in the last, now, 20 days, with the Ukrainian invasion into Russia.
[00:07:10.184 --> 00:07:13.127]  And things are just getting started right now.
[00:07:14.482 --> 00:07:22.287]  Now I want to air some of the incredible excerpts from the Kennedy-Trump rally in Arizona Friday.
[00:07:23.167 --> 00:07:27.890]  Also, there was the incredibly historic speech of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.592]  when he endorsed Trump on Friday.
[00:07:31.192 --> 00:07:32.533]  We also have so much other news.
[00:07:32.553 --> 00:07:35.535]  I want to make sure I get to that first before we get into all those clips.
[00:07:35.575 --> 00:07:36.255]  They were amazing.
[00:07:36.835 --> 00:07:43.560]  And Roger Stone joins us with updates and breaking news in the last 30 minutes of the show coming up in about an hour and 22 minutes from now.
[00:07:46.735 --> 00:07:57.778]  But, it's very important to understand that the campaign has been about making America great again, but what really makes America great again?
[00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:13.443]  We have the worst childhood obesity, the worst autism, the worst cancer rates, the worst fatty liver, the worst everything, and the worst healthcare of any industrialized nation, and a bunch of other third world nations are ahead of us, in the world.
[00:08:13.523 --> 00:08:14.584]  We're being killed
[00:08:15.609 --> 00:08:26.035]  By design, just like they admitted last Thursday, the federal government, okay, the fluoride lowers your IQ, gives you cancer, dumbs you down, destroys your fertility.
[00:08:27.176 --> 00:08:32.620]  The dam is breaking, and all of this information is starting to come out.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:41.005]  So the fact that Kennedy and Trump, and Trump pledged, not just in a speech with Kennedy, but in a video announcement he made before the rally,
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:53.165]  That his main legacy will be reversing the disease and record death in our children that is our future.
[00:08:54.205 --> 00:09:09.913]  And I was sent by the head of the campaign last night, and I put it up on X this morning, their new official banner, image, and slogan, M-A-H-A, MAHA, Make America Healthy Again.
[00:09:12.342 --> 00:09:17.392]  So we broke that, and they've been being really nice, giving a lot of exclusive behind-the-scenes photos and more.
[00:09:20.678 --> 00:09:21.680]  And I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[00:09:24.895 --> 00:09:33.240]  We could obviously get Kennedy on the show, but I agree with the strategic reasons that I am so polarizing with all the demonization that would become a distraction.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:41.185]  So once Trump's in the White House, we'll definitely get Trump and Kennedy on the show for listeners.
[00:09:41.966 --> 00:09:46.209]  I keep asking for that, but I think it's a distraction at this point, so that's a side issue.
[00:09:46.569 --> 00:09:47.449]  Let's just move on from it.
[00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:54.174]  But you do notice that I broke Tuesday that Kennedy would be making that announcement on
[00:09:55.583 --> 00:09:58.544]  Friday, it would probably be with Trump.
[00:09:59.424 --> 00:10:00.625]  They were going to do it in Los Angeles.
[00:10:00.645 --> 00:10:04.226]  They decided to move it so he could be with Trump there in Southern Arizona.
[00:10:05.046 --> 00:10:07.187]  And it's not about me saying, oh, look, I was right again.
[00:10:07.647 --> 00:10:08.367]  I wasn't right.
[00:10:08.427 --> 00:10:09.307]  They just didn't lie to me.
[00:10:09.327 --> 00:10:12.168]  It wasn't like I predicted or looked into a crystal ball.
[00:10:12.909 --> 00:10:16.130]  I was told that by high up in the campaign sources.
[00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.730]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:10:17.776 --> 00:10:21.020]  Not Dale Bigtree, he's the campaign manager, but some other folks.
[00:10:22.441 --> 00:10:23.242]  Very close to Kennedy.
[00:10:23.843 --> 00:10:24.444]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:10:25.665 --> 00:10:27.867]  And so there you go.
[00:10:28.008 --> 00:10:29.029]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:10:29.649 --> 00:10:32.072]  People were really on my ass saying I made that up Tuesday.
[00:10:32.092 --> 00:10:35.496]  And then he just said, the next day I got a big announcement coming up Friday.
[00:10:35.516 --> 00:10:36.817]  They're like, well, you're still making it up.
[00:10:37.924 --> 00:10:39.525]  I don't ever make stuff up on purpose.
[00:10:39.766 --> 00:10:40.967]  I get things wrong here and there.
[00:10:40.987 --> 00:10:42.908]  I mispronounce names a lot.
[00:10:43.549 --> 00:10:45.870]  Sometimes I flip statistics around because I'm teleprompter free.
[00:10:46.631 --> 00:10:48.593]  But I never get something wrong on purpose.
[00:10:49.313 --> 00:10:50.354]  I want to be credible.
[00:10:50.474 --> 00:10:51.695]  I want to be truthful.
[00:10:52.156 --> 00:10:54.257]  I want to be the opposite of corporate media.
[00:10:54.277 --> 00:10:58.220]  I want to be the opposite of CNN and MSNBC and The Washington Post and The New York Times.
[00:10:58.301 --> 00:10:58.801]  And we are.
[00:10:59.682 --> 00:11:01.003]  And that's why they want us off air.
[00:11:01.163 --> 00:11:05.666]  Because they know, people know, 98% of the time, we're dead on.
[00:11:08.393 --> 00:11:11.474]  I said I'd get to more of the clips later after I hit all this other news.
[00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:15.956]  We'll do the whole RFK Trump situation next hour.
[00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:18.637]  There's a lot to cover, a lot to unpack.
[00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:25.800]  You know, it trended on X, it trended on Instagram and all over the national news yesterday that Trump is going to replace
[00:11:28.328 --> 00:11:29.710]  Vance with RFK Jr.
[00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:36.617]  That is the left and corporate media trying to undermine Vance and Trump to act like there's something wrong with Vance when he's great.
[00:11:37.418 --> 00:11:40.181]  And that was never the intention and that's not going to happen.
[00:11:40.842 --> 00:11:45.347]  And I got that directly from very high up in the Trump operation.
[00:11:45.387 --> 00:11:46.007]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:11:47.789 --> 00:11:48.409]  Real high up.
[00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.571]  Just like I got the information high up on RFK.
[00:11:53.391 --> 00:11:58.794]  And folks are being nice to me because they recognize we're one of the biggest bulldogs for liberty out there.
[00:11:59.534 --> 00:12:05.496]  And so we're going to be getting a lot more exclusives here on Trump and on everything else that surrounds it.
[00:12:06.237 --> 00:12:08.938]  Because it is recognized that InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:16.801]  And I say that as a report to our backers, the real shareholders of this broadcast that have kept this embattled ship in the fight.
[00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:18.405]  Is that right?
[00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:41.290]  And I appreciate you, and I also will report back to you, we're kicking some ass.
[00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:42.251]  So, thank you.
[00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:43.551]  And you're kicking ass with us.
[00:12:44.092 --> 00:12:50.074]  Because, I mean, I would have no energy to swing my leg and my foot into the New World Order's arse if it wasn't for you.
[00:12:50.154 --> 00:12:56.037]  So, thank you for the energy, and the will, and the support, and the intel, and all of it.
[00:12:56.537 --> 00:12:59.758]  So, just want to always be thankful and humble.
[00:13:00.839 --> 00:13:02.319]  And thank you all for commissioning us.
[00:13:02.339 --> 00:13:04.900]  You know, like when you commission a painter to do an artwork or something.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.861]  Well, you've commissioned me.
[00:13:06.923 --> 00:13:09.504]  With your support and your word of mouth to be here.
[00:13:10.484 --> 00:13:15.026]  And so I just respectfully ask you to keep us in the fight and keep us in the game.
[00:13:16.747 --> 00:13:17.087]  All right.
[00:13:18.767 --> 00:13:21.789]  Let's go ahead and get to a few clips, though, because they're so good, I can't help it.
[00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:31.032]  Here is Trump when he talks about the 325,000 missing children.
[00:13:34.656 --> 00:13:43.001]  The corporate media and the fact checkers tried to attack this, but then they got destroyed when people started posting on X and other places right under it.
[00:13:44.462 --> 00:13:55.410]  The fact that the Senate report from nine years ago about Obama when he opened the border up just partially compared to Biden, and how there was an estimated 500,000 unaccountable minors,
[00:13:58.092 --> 00:14:04.678]  And that over 50,000 were under the age of five, and that many had been found, thousands, over 10,000.
[00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:11.765]  You just type in, Senate Report Finds Children Smuggled Across Border Found in Sex Slavery, Washington Post.
[00:14:12.286 --> 00:14:13.607]  You'll get that from nine years ago.
[00:14:13.627 --> 00:14:15.729]  Or 2000 and late, late 2015, it was early 2016.
[00:14:15.929 --> 00:14:16.009]  And
[00:14:22.796 --> 00:14:23.436]  That was then.
[00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:31.682]  Then last year, they had a Senate report that there were 480-something thousand children under the age of 12 in the U.S.
[00:14:31.783 --> 00:14:32.403]  under Biden.
[00:14:32.923 --> 00:14:33.964]  That was only two and a half years in.
[00:14:33.984 --> 00:14:35.345]  Now we're three and a half years in or more.
[00:14:36.226 --> 00:14:41.970]  And that then, 89,000 had completely disappeared.
[00:14:42.851 --> 00:14:46.053]  Well, the new numbers came out last week, and I hadn't even seen these yet.
[00:14:46.093 --> 00:14:46.753]  I guess Trump did.
[00:14:46.793 --> 00:14:47.354]  I looked it up.
[00:14:48.456 --> 00:14:48.876]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:14:48.896 --> 00:14:50.979]  Obama administration placed children with human traffickers.
[00:14:51.539 --> 00:14:52.380]  Senate report says.
[00:14:52.801 --> 00:14:53.401]  Washington Post.
[00:14:55.063 --> 00:14:55.684]  Scroll the date.
[00:14:55.704 --> 00:14:56.665]  Let's see if my memory serves.
[00:14:56.725 --> 00:14:58.427]  Is it late 2015 or is it 16?
[00:14:58.467 --> 00:14:58.807]  Scroll down.
[00:14:59.288 --> 00:14:59.928]  Let's see my memory.
[00:15:00.208 --> 00:15:00.729]  Scroll down, please.
[00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:03.172]  Alright, maybe we can't do that.
[00:15:03.752 --> 00:15:07.676]  So, the issue here is that
[00:15:08.695 --> 00:15:10.115]  Now, it's January 28, 2016.
[00:15:10.416 --> 00:15:12.096]  Okay, there you go.
[00:15:12.116 --> 00:15:12.536]  So early 2016.
[00:15:12.856 --> 00:15:17.078]  I remember it was late in the late 2015 or early 2016.
[00:15:17.298 --> 00:15:18.578]  So there, nailed it again.
[00:15:18.618 --> 00:15:25.520]  I just want to show you that I'm not just, people seem to be here, see me talking, and then this guy's, you know, making this stuff up.
[00:15:25.761 --> 00:15:27.381]  No, they're in there checking everything I say.
[00:15:28.521 --> 00:15:33.663]  And a few percentage points, my memory isn't photographic like it was when I was about 40.
[00:15:34.703 --> 00:15:35.644]  It's no longer photographic.
[00:15:35.704 --> 00:15:36.124]  It was,
[00:15:37.483 --> 00:15:39.528]  And it was actually painful, because I remembered everything.
[00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:45.301]  And the good thing about age is, it's just kind of like your sight, it starts to fade, but I've still got very good recall.
[00:15:45.341 --> 00:15:46.524]  But, I digress.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:16:06.753]  So, the point is, there's a new ICE Border Patrol report out with the Senate numbers, and it is the number Trump said, 325,000 children, and they found some of them dead, a lot of them in sex slavery, but it just, it's in the local news.
[00:16:06.913 --> 00:16:08.654]  It doesn't hit the national news.
[00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:13.638]  So, when you see Kamala Harris talking about how she found out somebody was reportedly
[00:16:14.438 --> 00:16:30.905]  Abusing a child sexually when she was young and she reported it and then she's presided as the borders are the last three and a half plus years over the biggest trafficking of children the world has ever seen along with her compatriot and her accomplice
[00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:33.440]  Alejandro Mayorkas.
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.202]  I mean, these people are real supervillains.
[00:16:37.282 --> 00:16:57.492]  Even the New York Times over a year ago reported hundreds of thousands have been found not even going to school as young as nine, average age 12, sleeping in warehouses on cots at tire factories and cereal factories and food processing factories and meatpacking factories.
[00:16:58.272 --> 00:17:00.694]  I mean, what are adults doing at these meatpacking factories?
[00:17:01.519 --> 00:17:11.644]  And at these, in Ohio and Michigan and Illinois, some of the most corrupt states as you know, when it comes to slave labor, and you're there and little kids are sleeping there?
[00:17:12.505 --> 00:17:16.347]  And little kids are getting caught and hurt and killed in the machines?
[00:17:17.147 --> 00:17:17.888]  That's in the news!
[00:17:17.928 --> 00:17:19.869]  The New York Times is telling you that!
[00:17:20.049 --> 00:17:21.149]  And they're whitewashing it!
[00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:25.492]  I mean, but of course you call the cops in those areas of Michigan.
[00:17:26.365 --> 00:17:28.347]  Or those areas of Illinois or Ohio.
[00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:29.788]  They're on the payroll.
[00:17:29.828 --> 00:17:30.548]  They don't come.
[00:17:30.829 --> 00:17:32.170]  Oh, those are illegal alien kids.
[00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:33.110]  You can just use them.
[00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:35.252]  They're the lucky ones.
[00:17:36.573 --> 00:17:38.134]  That which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:17:38.154 --> 00:17:41.157]  I'm not saying it's good, but at least they're not getting raped.
[00:17:42.298 --> 00:17:44.700]  So you cannot molest it.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.780]  You cannot.
[00:17:46.641 --> 00:17:47.522]  You cannot.
[00:17:50.359 --> 00:17:55.925]  Make this up, and because of the New York Times reporting it, Tyson and Perdue are facing child labor investigations.
[00:17:56.405 --> 00:18:05.134]  Of course, the left wants to ban a child under the age of 15 helping milk cows on the family farm, or helping drive a tractor and shredding for hay.
[00:18:06.315 --> 00:18:09.418]  Oh, but if you want children in sex slavery, it's A-OK.
[00:18:09.458 --> 00:18:12.161]  So, here's Trump hitting on all cylinders.
[00:18:13.575 --> 00:18:18.279]  Listen to this.
[00:18:18.299 --> 00:18:20.080]  325,000 migrant children are gone.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.001]  They're missing.
[00:18:21.821 --> 00:18:24.804]  She allowed them to be trafficked into our country.
[00:18:25.464 --> 00:18:32.950]  Many of these children are now in sex slavery or they're dead, probably mostly dead.
[00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.853]  They will never see their homes or their parents again.
[00:18:36.933 --> 00:18:38.754]  They were swiped out of their homes.
[00:18:39.255 --> 00:18:41.677]  They were taken out of their homes.
[00:18:43.871 --> 00:18:47.375]  This is a government number, 325,000 children.
[00:18:48.457 --> 00:18:50.599]  Sex slaves, or they're dead.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.001]  Many are dead.
[00:18:52.021 --> 00:19:02.914]  Hamas has sold- When we put this two-hour show up tonight at Bandot Video and Real Alex Jones on X, I want that clip at the start of the show.
[00:19:05.709 --> 00:19:06.290]  More of that.
[00:19:07.332 --> 00:19:08.975]  And that's really what I should have said up front.
[00:19:08.995 --> 00:19:14.886]  I meant to say this right when I came on 19 minutes ago and I kind of dropped the ball because I need to announce the big theme I'm seeing here.
[00:19:16.069 --> 00:19:16.889]  I think you're seeing it too.
[00:19:16.929 --> 00:19:19.210]  I've seen it all over X. I don't need to tell people this.
[00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.790]  Everybody sees it.
[00:19:20.391 --> 00:19:23.512]  Trump just took the gloves off and took it up another level with RFK Jr.
[00:19:23.972 --> 00:19:29.694]  And RFK Jr., I was talking to his campaign head last night, is really influencing Trump heavily.
[00:19:30.194 --> 00:19:34.476]  Trump really likes Bobby Kennedy and really respects him and is listening to him.
[00:19:34.976 --> 00:19:42.059]  And Trump told him personally, and Kennedy talked about this in his speech Friday, that Trump pledged to him.
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:44.580]  Pledged to him.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:51.744]  That he wants to make it his legacy to detoxify the food and the water, get the GMOs out, and stop Big Pharma.
[00:19:53.085 --> 00:19:57.128]  And privately, you already saw a leaked video of this, but I've got the inside baseball.
[00:19:57.708 --> 00:19:59.869]  Trump said, look, I tried to get the economy going.
[00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:01.370]  I tried to get all the therapeutics going.
[00:20:01.931 --> 00:20:02.671]  They lied to me.
[00:20:02.811 --> 00:20:05.853]  I do think they're, quote, giving the kids too much, too big a shot.
[00:20:06.114 --> 00:20:08.495]  That's his way of mentally dealing with it, because Trump won't admit he's wrong.
[00:20:08.936 --> 00:20:13.679]  Part of one of his strengths is that he's very pig-headed, very donkey-like, very mule-like.
[00:20:13.739 --> 00:20:15.460]  And I am too, but not to that extent.
[00:20:16.501 --> 00:20:17.001]  We're good to go.
[00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:39.653]  And I've talked to people that were from both sides that were in the discussions.
[00:20:40.194 --> 00:20:42.838]  Because Trump knows I've talked to Trump and talked to his people.
[00:20:43.259 --> 00:20:45.181]  And Trump's like, I don't want to hear from you again.
[00:20:45.682 --> 00:20:46.964]  You know, you keep bringing this up to me.
[00:20:47.144 --> 00:20:47.806]  I've told the story.
[00:20:47.826 --> 00:20:48.787]  It was a couple years ago.
[00:20:49.631 --> 00:20:52.173]  So he's still the lesser of two evils, so I'm supporting him.
[00:20:52.553 --> 00:20:57.017]  But now putting Kennedy in there, and reportedly going to put him in charge of this, it's going to be huge.
[00:20:57.577 --> 00:21:00.539]  Regardless on big commissions that report to Congress.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:06.884]  Because Trump is thinking he can get him appointed to HHS, because those need Senate approval.
[00:21:06.984 --> 00:21:12.448]  But Trump can make him the CIA director, because that's the executive branch appointed by the President.
[00:21:12.809 --> 00:21:14.390]  And a little bird told me,
[00:21:15.936 --> 00:21:20.157]  That he is in strong consideration for the director of the CIA.
[00:21:21.598 --> 00:21:25.299]  And that Kennedy hadn't even thought about that.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.381]  So, Trump is asking, would he want that job?
[00:21:31.441 --> 00:21:38.083]  Now, I'll be honest, I think Trump oughta, the globals already know though, but Trump oughta be keeping that to himself.
[00:21:38.983 --> 00:21:43.944]  I mean, the deep state's already tried to kill him, but that scares the living snot out of them.
[00:21:45.225 --> 00:21:45.405]  So,
[00:21:46.938 --> 00:21:51.282]  Every little thing I'm saying here, if I shot its own video about it and put it on X, it'd get 5 million views.
[00:21:51.322 --> 00:22:01.350]  In fact, the live show on all these radio stations is great, and I love it, but kind of the format, I'm just up here breaking bombshell after bombshell after bombshell, and it doesn't even really do it justice, does it?
[00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.733]  Trump exposes the elephant in the room, the demon in the room.
[00:22:05.959 --> 00:22:10.322]  The giant sex slavery, many of the kids killed, all confirmed, but nobody's talking about it.
[00:22:10.402 --> 00:22:11.522]  That's ultra-massive.
[00:22:11.883 --> 00:22:12.803]  That's a huge story.
[00:22:13.504 --> 00:22:16.525]  Trump considering him for CIA director, over-the-top, wild.
[00:22:18.086 --> 00:22:22.629]  Trump already saying he's going to set up multiple commissions with executive power.
[00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:31.815]  That means Trump will sign executive orders off of his recommendations to bypass the tyranny of Congress and to bypass them not approving him.
[00:22:32.595 --> 00:22:36.577]  And that he'll follow those recommendations on the poisoned food and everything else?
[00:22:36.677 --> 00:22:41.339]  I mean, this, all of this is so sensationally good.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:47.322]  It makes me so happy, but then I'm also not stupid, and I know you're not stupid.
[00:22:48.543 --> 00:22:53.285]  If you think the New World Order was fighting for their lives before, they are on death's doorstep politically.
[00:22:54.066 --> 00:22:55.927]  I mean, this is spectacular.
[00:22:58.088 --> 00:23:00.349]  And I gotta just say this, and I'll talk about it coming up after the break.
[00:23:01.613 --> 00:23:02.533]  Because they're coming after Musk.
[00:23:03.234 --> 00:23:05.835]  Musk, Christ said you judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:23:05.855 --> 00:23:08.796]  So you can argue all day, oh on Halloween he wore a devil outfit.
[00:23:09.176 --> 00:23:09.496]  Okay.
[00:23:10.176 --> 00:23:11.617]  Or he was for this or that.
[00:23:13.017 --> 00:23:13.958]  Move all that aside.
[00:23:14.158 --> 00:23:15.158]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:23:15.318 --> 00:23:17.999]  Elon Musk is annihilating the globalists.
[00:23:18.439 --> 00:23:20.140]  He is devastating their operations.
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.701]  He's cleaning their clocks.
[00:23:22.261 --> 00:23:24.682]  And he's doing irrevocable
[00:23:25.967 --> 00:23:29.571]  Massive systemic damage to their operations worldwide.
[00:23:30.131 --> 00:23:32.894]  They are in total hysteria mode.
[00:23:34.232 --> 00:23:35.232]  And so I will say it right now.
[00:23:35.592 --> 00:23:40.253]  And I told Elon Musk this months ago, and he responded to my tweet and my video with Tucker Carlson and said, I agree with you.
[00:23:40.813 --> 00:23:41.754]  I'm going to up my security.
[00:23:41.774 --> 00:23:43.174]  And I know people that work with him.
[00:23:43.214 --> 00:23:44.714]  He's like tripled it, basically.
[00:23:45.334 --> 00:23:47.575]  And he's doing a lot of stuff I'm not going to talk about on air.
[00:23:48.375 --> 00:23:51.196]  And now he's really beefed it after they saw him try to kill Trump.
[00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:52.876]  Because Musk isn't dumb.
[00:23:52.936 --> 00:23:53.916]  He knows he's next.
[00:23:54.456 --> 00:23:55.477]  Kennedy knows he's next.
[00:23:55.657 --> 00:23:56.377]  I know I'm next.
[00:23:56.417 --> 00:23:57.357]  Tucker knows he's next.
[00:24:00.558 --> 00:24:04.380]  It's like my mother goes, I like Trump, but why are you all in constantly?
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:05.860]  Your life depends on it.
[00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:07.141]  My God, worry about your family.
[00:24:07.261 --> 00:24:13.444]  Two weeks ago at dinner, I said, Mom, they're trying to get through him to get to me and all of us.
[00:24:13.684 --> 00:24:16.265]  When Trump says that, that's damn true, people.
[00:24:16.525 --> 00:24:17.926]  That's not some saying here.
[00:24:18.606 --> 00:24:23.149]  When that bullet almost killed him, if they could kill Trump, what do you think they're going to do to me?
[00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:26.310]  They're going for broke once they steal this election.
[00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:27.170]  I'm getting chills right now.
[00:24:27.671 --> 00:24:30.132]  They're all over the news saying they're going to have martial law and round us all up.
[00:24:32.984 --> 00:24:34.485]  Do people comprehend what I'm saying?
[00:24:35.245 --> 00:24:35.705]  Comprende?
[00:24:36.866 --> 00:24:39.888]  I mean, we're not in Kansas anymore, people.
[00:24:41.228 --> 00:24:43.610]  And the good news is the public's finally getting the urgency.
[00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:54.476]  And everybody from Naomi Wolf, super respected on the left, to, you know, people on the far right are all saying the Democrats are cancer, they're psychotic, they're demons, they've got to be stopped.
[00:24:54.936 --> 00:24:58.018]  I said I wouldn't play these clips, but it's got to, I got like 20 of them.
[00:24:58.658 --> 00:25:00.319]  Let's go out to break with a clip.
[00:25:01.439 --> 00:25:01.519]  17 and 18.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.441]  I mean, here he is all over multiple Fox shows.
[00:25:04.481 --> 00:25:05.922]  He's all over all the top shows.
[00:25:07.703 --> 00:25:09.484]  The globalists hate this coming out on the news.
[00:25:09.945 --> 00:25:11.265]  They hate this being discussed.
[00:25:11.285 --> 00:25:19.530]  They hate the secrets of their GMOs and their seed oils and all the toxins they put in there on purpose that are so addictive and make you fat and unhealthy.
[00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:20.471]  Oh, now it's official.
[00:25:20.511 --> 00:25:25.374]  Bill Gates has launched Franken-cows that don't fart or burp and aren't even cows.
[00:25:25.694 --> 00:25:26.434]  Super toxic.
[00:25:26.454 --> 00:25:27.415]  We've got news on that.
[00:25:27.435 --> 00:25:30.157]  It's over the top, all of it.
[00:25:32.332 --> 00:25:34.155]  But let's go out to break with RfK Jr.
[00:25:34.175 --> 00:25:39.124]  Just a few of the clips of him going full on against Big Pharma and Big Food.
[00:25:39.164 --> 00:25:39.886]  That's the same group.
[00:25:39.906 --> 00:25:40.206]  Here it is.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:54.650]  President Trump is going to make a series of announcements about other Democrats who are joining his campaign.
[00:25:54.670 --> 00:26:01.518]  I want to make America healthy again, and so does President Trump.
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:04.942]  Those are objectives.
[00:26:07.404 --> 00:26:30.624]  The Wall Street Journal may be worried about shareholder value for pharmaceutical companies, and I think, you know, I talked specifically to President Trump about that issue, and he said that he wanted to leave, as his legacy, healthy children, and that, you know, that he was unconcerned about the other implications.
[00:26:31.144 --> 00:26:34.105]  Is it fair to say that you would try to dismantle some of those organizations?
[00:26:34.366 --> 00:26:35.926]  No, I wouldn't dismantle them.
[00:26:36.246 --> 00:26:38.928]  I would change the focus and I would end the corruption.
[00:26:40.208 --> 00:26:44.910]  Right now, 75% of FDA's budget is coming from pharmaceutical companies.
[00:26:45.891 --> 00:26:47.972]  That is a perverse incentive.
[00:26:49.012 --> 00:26:53.494]  In NIH, if you, scientists and officials in NIH,
[00:26:55.117 --> 00:27:02.383]  Who work on drug development, who incubate drugs for the pharmaceutical company, get to collect lifetime royalties from those products.
[00:27:02.423 --> 00:27:03.424]  These are regulators.
[00:27:03.464 --> 00:27:06.206]  They're supposed to be looking for problems in those products.
[00:27:07.067 --> 00:27:11.631]  We have these agencies that have become sock puppets for the industries they're supposed to regulate.
[00:27:11.651 --> 00:27:14.693]  So they're not really interested in public health.
[00:27:15.013 --> 00:27:19.797]  Everybody, the most profitable thing today in America is a sick child.
[00:27:20.398 --> 00:27:21.559]  Everybody's making money.
[00:27:21.599 --> 00:27:23.200]  The hospitals are making money.
[00:27:24.341 --> 00:27:28.304]  Pharmaceutical companies are making money, even the insurance companies make money.
[00:27:29.185 --> 00:27:41.935]  And we need to end those perverse incentives, we need to get the corruption out of FDA, out of NIH, out of CDC, and make them function as they're supposed to function, which is to protect public health and particularly children's health.
[00:27:42.716 --> 00:27:44.577]  And by the way, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:27:44.637 --> 00:27:46.659]  is doing devastating damage to the cult.
[00:27:47.503 --> 00:28:00.657]  They want to medicalize them for their lives, suck millions of dollars out of them, just like the transgender movement targets mainly autistic and mentally ill children, where they take them away from their children and then convince someone who's mentally ill or low IQ to be sterilized, saying it's a cool identity.
[00:28:00.677 --> 00:28:02.459]  It's like a kid will want to be Superman.
[00:28:02.479 --> 00:28:03.279]  You're not really Superman.
[00:28:04.255 --> 00:28:10.083]  So it's the same thing, and our children are dying, and just praise God for what's happened with RFK Jr.
[00:28:10.783 --> 00:28:12.606]  and all the massive coverage he's getting.
[00:28:12.966 --> 00:28:14.508]  This is everything we've asked for happening.
[00:28:14.809 --> 00:28:18.033]  The cult of death, of depopulation, is being exposed!
[00:28:29.599 --> 00:28:34.743]  Bill Maher and Eyepatch McCain, along with James Carville, were crapping bricks last night.
[00:28:34.763 --> 00:28:35.664]  Talk about R.L.K.
[00:28:35.684 --> 00:28:35.724]  Jr.
[00:28:50.735 --> 00:29:05.740]  I mean, I tell you, for those of us who have a certain age, who grew up with the Kennedys, I mean, to have a Kennedy endorse not just any Republican, but the worst one ever, what do we make of this, gentlemen?
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.100]  Well, you know, every family has a whatever.
[00:29:11.784 --> 00:29:14.387]  That guy is not weird.
[00:29:14.467 --> 00:29:17.731]  There's something that... There's an expression he uses in New Orleans.
[00:29:18.192 --> 00:29:19.133]  That boy ain't right.
[00:29:20.194 --> 00:29:21.556]  Okay?
[00:29:21.616 --> 00:29:23.518]  There's something way... Weird?
[00:29:23.558 --> 00:29:24.199]  You're weird.
[00:29:24.779 --> 00:29:25.240]  Okay?
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.343]  That's nothing wrong with being weird.
[00:29:27.803 --> 00:29:28.724]  But that boy ain't right.
[00:29:28.804 --> 00:29:30.126]  He just did something wrong.
[00:29:30.166 --> 00:29:31.427]  He hit his head or something.
[00:29:31.447 --> 00:29:31.868]  I don't know what.
[00:29:38.482 --> 00:29:40.482]  I wouldn't go that far.
[00:29:40.823 --> 00:29:41.183]  I would.
[00:29:41.443 --> 00:29:43.563]  Okay.
[00:29:51.865 --> 00:29:52.965]  Sunday Night Live!
[00:29:55.246 --> 00:29:58.486]  R.L.K., Trump alliance sends the left into total hysteria.
[00:30:01.287 --> 00:30:03.367]  It sends shockwaves across the political spectrum.
[00:30:03.567 --> 00:30:05.928]  Deep State, now in full panning mode.
[00:30:10.402 --> 00:30:15.084]  So, I can take that one-minute clip and teach a college course on it.
[00:30:15.504 --> 00:30:18.445]  Carville's completely weird, one of the creepiest students on the planet.
[00:30:19.405 --> 00:30:39.933]  You got Ipache McCain up there, who is about as leftist as mouths say tongue, and lies to his constituents constantly, laughing and smiling and nodding his head while they talk crap about Trump and RFK Jr., and then not even Maher agrees with him, because he knows almost everybody watching likes Trump and RFK.
[00:30:42.128 --> 00:30:53.037]  But, if you're driving around in Texas, and I saw one of these the other day, and you've got a I-Patch McCain sticker on your car, something's wrong with you.
[00:30:54.899 --> 00:31:05.288]  But, as I said, they are apoplectic, they don't know what to do, and so their answer is, Trump and RFK Jr.
[00:31:05.408 --> 00:31:05.988]  are weird.
[00:31:06.969 --> 00:31:10.292]  No, Tim Walz, Tampon Tim, is weird.
[00:31:12.543 --> 00:31:16.464]  Supporting communism, supporting radical Islam, being a communist Chinese agent.
[00:31:18.284 --> 00:31:18.825]  That's weird.
[00:31:20.425 --> 00:31:21.285]  These people are weird.
[00:31:22.566 --> 00:31:24.226]  And that's all they got is that we're weird?
[00:31:25.366 --> 00:31:31.488]  But I guess if you're some type of weird pervert, people that aren't are weird to you.
[00:31:32.677 --> 00:31:44.303]  We've got thousands of more fake articles they admit that Kamala Harris pays for to be put in newspapers and online at Google and the rest of it about how she's way ahead and Trump doesn't have any energy and she's incredible.
[00:31:44.543 --> 00:31:51.946]  She's not given one interview since they replaced Biden with her.
[00:31:55.748 --> 00:31:56.869]  And that leads me to this.
[00:31:56.929 --> 00:31:59.070]  This is just an incredible clip.
[00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:00.630]  It's short.
[00:32:00.991 --> 00:32:01.471]  It's sweet.
[00:32:02.697 --> 00:32:04.618]  And it shows you the arrogance of these people.
[00:32:06.719 --> 00:32:14.984]  Once I was out to dinner with a very prominent person, and Gavin Newsom, about a year ago, a little less than a year ago, called them during the dinner.
[00:32:16.925 --> 00:32:30.212]  And so, the individual talked to him a few minutes, while our steaks were coming, hung up the phone, showed me some of the text messages from him, just said, just don't say my name, and Newsom's like, please don't talk bad about me.
[00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:32.470]  On your podcast.
[00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:34.631]  Please be nice to me.
[00:32:34.691 --> 00:32:35.891]  I really agree with you guys.
[00:32:35.931 --> 00:32:37.031]  I'm doing the best I can.
[00:32:37.391 --> 00:32:38.571]  I know this is all bull.
[00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:42.732]  And that's what he was begging him on the phone to do.
[00:32:43.732 --> 00:32:45.252]  Please, my kids watch you.
[00:32:45.893 --> 00:32:47.173]  Please don't talk bad about me.
[00:32:48.093 --> 00:32:50.413]  So here's Newsom, who wrecked California.
[00:32:51.054 --> 00:32:55.034]  Passed all these laws where, you know, men can have sex with 12 year old boys.
[00:32:55.374 --> 00:32:55.714]  Literally.
[00:32:56.214 --> 00:32:56.575]  Signed it.
[00:32:57.455 --> 00:32:58.835]  Did all these other terrible things.
[00:33:01.331 --> 00:33:05.554]  And his new thing is just to say, yeah, we did clean up San Francisco for the communist Chinese dictator.
[00:33:05.814 --> 00:33:06.235]  So what?
[00:33:06.255 --> 00:33:06.735]  Get used to it.
[00:33:07.536 --> 00:33:09.597]  So now he goes on a podcast yesterday.
[00:33:09.617 --> 00:33:10.858]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:33:10.898 --> 00:33:11.799]  You'll see the full thing.
[00:33:12.399 --> 00:33:18.984]  Governor Newsom laughs over DNC's switch to Kamala Harris says he was told to call it inclusive.
[00:33:21.604 --> 00:33:35.507]  He admits it's a fraud, he admits he's a puppet, he admits it's a lie, and he laughs about it with other Democrat Party operatives, and other Democrats tune in when the joke's on them as the idiot constituents, where they then laugh at themselves being conned.
[00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:46.210]  It'd be like if somebody sold you a car saying it was new, and you find out that it's three years old and was in a flood, and it's completely worthless, and the engine doesn't even start.
[00:33:47.841 --> 00:33:48.962]  There's been cases of that.
[00:33:49.723 --> 00:33:50.684]  Oh, it's a brand new car!
[00:33:50.944 --> 00:33:52.645]  You buy it, never even starts!
[00:33:54.607 --> 00:33:57.790]  And then you laugh, haha, you conned me, you ripped me off, this is so cute!
[00:33:59.011 --> 00:34:00.733]  Kamala Harris isn't gonna give you free tips.
[00:34:02.634 --> 00:34:04.576]  Kamala Harris isn't gonna give you no taxes on tips.
[00:34:06.057 --> 00:34:07.278]  Trump, if he says it, will do it.
[00:34:08.359 --> 00:34:12.383]  Again, everything with them, it's like claiming Taylor Swift and Beyoncé
[00:34:13.757 --> 00:34:33.670]  And George W. Bush, we're all gonna be at the DNC the last night, because no one was wanting to come, it was so boring, to the fourth day, and they couldn't fill the bleachers, so they put out, through their surrogates, through their influencers, on their payroll, like Don Lemon, to say, oh, where it is, Beyonce and Taylor Swift tonight?
[00:34:34.991 --> 00:34:39.554]  I told you two weeks before that, I saw influencers saying Taylor Swift would be there.
[00:34:40.575 --> 00:34:41.876]  People went, well wait, she's in Europe,
[00:34:43.131 --> 00:34:44.412]  I didn't say she was going to be there!
[00:34:47.055 --> 00:34:49.837]  I saw the influencers saying two weeks before that!
[00:34:50.598 --> 00:34:52.559]  I'm not bragging, I just noticed stuff.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:35:07.393]  I'm sitting there scanning this, and I see this big crowd, and I see people, I go and search into some of the folks that are there to see if the crowd was that big, and what they did is bunch them all together and put them in like a column so it looked bigger out of the airplane, and they did a close camera shot, so that's a trick.
[00:35:08.493 --> 00:35:11.436]  They put out some AI photos that added crowd as well.
[00:35:11.536 --> 00:35:12.778]  I mean, but that was a big crowd.
[00:35:13.198 --> 00:35:13.519]  It was like 20,000.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:15.581]  Biggest you ever had.
[00:35:16.422 --> 00:35:18.624]  Until the DNC where they paid most of them to be there.
[00:35:20.727 --> 00:35:23.230]  And I found out that they said Taylor Swift would be there.
[00:35:24.818 --> 00:35:27.300]  And sure as hell, people said, oh Jones, you didn't see that.
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:28.941]  I don't have the crew of the people.
[00:35:29.001 --> 00:35:32.723]  I should have like an off-air crew of like three guys with me, or girl, whoever, three people.
[00:35:33.463 --> 00:35:34.764]  And then I'm like, see that, see that?
[00:35:34.884 --> 00:35:39.327]  And just film me seeing it, and then just put reports out in live time, because I move so fast, it's hard to do it.
[00:35:39.607 --> 00:35:41.628]  And I put out the tweet, it went viral, got millions of views.
[00:35:42.749 --> 00:35:44.470]  Millions of reads on that, people said.
[00:35:46.131 --> 00:35:49.293]  And then some of the commenters were like, well wait, here is a link where they said Taylor Swift would be there.
[00:35:49.513 --> 00:35:51.074]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:53.115 --> 00:35:55.016]  That was a beta test, so that worked.
[00:35:56.896 --> 00:35:59.437]  So they tried it again at the DNC.
[00:36:00.237 --> 00:36:02.298]  But this time, they had big influencers do it.
[00:36:03.058 --> 00:36:04.898]  Big, so-called big talk show hosts.
[00:36:06.099 --> 00:36:13.741]  And people hear, you know, Don Lemon saying, well, I hear it's going to be Beyonce, and it's going to be Taylor Swift, and my god, Elvis is going to be there too, and the Martians.
[00:36:15.563 --> 00:36:16.764]  Abraham Lincoln's gonna show up.
[00:36:17.024 --> 00:36:26.252]  So, here's Governor Newsom, laughs over DNC switch to Kamala Harris, says he was told it was inclusive and makes a big joke about how she was installed.
[00:36:26.292 --> 00:36:26.612]  Here it is.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.780]  There's an intangible, it's different.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.161]  How are you feeling about the switch?
[00:36:30.781 --> 00:36:32.061]  I mean, the switch.
[00:36:32.661 --> 00:36:36.442]  Now we went through a very open process, a very inclusive process.
[00:36:37.162 --> 00:36:39.162]  It was bottom-up, I don't know if you know that.
[00:36:39.322 --> 00:36:40.743]  Yes, that's what I've been told to say.
[00:36:40.803 --> 00:36:43.283]  It was a blitz primary, I believe.
[00:36:43.303 --> 00:36:44.123]  That's what they called it.
[00:36:44.163 --> 00:36:45.483]  It was a very, very fast blitz.
[00:36:45.564 --> 00:36:48.924]  I think it was a blink primary, so we call that.
[00:36:48.944 --> 00:36:53.245]  A 30-minute convention, you know, between a tweet and another tweet.
[00:36:53.285 --> 00:36:54.186]  It's amazing how it happened.
[00:36:54.226 --> 00:36:55.007]  Yeah, it's been amazing.
[00:36:55.027 --> 00:36:57.589]  But what is amazing is how unified everybody is.
[00:36:57.609 --> 00:36:58.150]  Yeah.
[00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:58.931]  I mean, it's next level.
[00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:23.532]  There are a lot of top scientists coming out and pointing this out, and I posted a bunch of these interviews on X today at Real Alex Jones.
[00:37:23.572 --> 00:37:24.232]  You should go watch them.
[00:37:25.033 --> 00:37:26.473]  And I guess I forgot to send them to the crew.
[00:37:26.593 --> 00:37:31.396]  My fault, but during this video I'm about to play, I'm going to send them a few of these clips because we need to see these.
[00:37:32.117 --> 00:37:34.358]  Respected top government advisors, you name it.
[00:37:34.398 --> 00:37:35.499]  We're getting top people now.
[00:37:35.979 --> 00:37:38.781]  We've always had top scientists, but now insiders are going, look.
[00:37:40.131 --> 00:37:45.156]  Bill Gates has been hyping bird flu for 20 years and funding all the research and the so-called vaccines.
[00:37:45.857 --> 00:37:49.221]  And it looks like they're already putting out some manipulated versions of it.
[00:37:49.621 --> 00:37:53.625]  And we believe he's getting ready to release something really serious.
[00:37:55.307 --> 00:37:56.869]  Really strong.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:58.621]  I think so.
[00:38:18.044 --> 00:38:31.590]  To supposedly control mosquito populations that are mutants, and he's also been talking about releasing mosquitoes that forcibly give you injections and forcibly, biologically, just like a head of lettuce can be engineered to be a vaccine or something else.
[00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:41.915]  It could be a pharmacological crop of a mosquito, a grape, a lettuce, a tomato, a potato, dates, yams, you name it.
[00:38:42.315 --> 00:38:44.856]  They can have plants grow this in it live.
[00:38:45.765 --> 00:38:54.313]  So now he's been doing all sorts of weird experimental releases of viruses, and all of a sudden these fevers that have never been in the United States are suddenly here.
[00:38:54.793 --> 00:39:05.223]  And then really rare stuff, like Zynga, we have Fauci all of a sudden getting West Nile infection.
[00:39:07.401 --> 00:39:09.863]  Now, that's like 1 in 20 million people.
[00:39:09.903 --> 00:39:10.544]  I mean, I looked it up.
[00:39:10.604 --> 00:39:11.765]  It's like super rare.
[00:39:12.585 --> 00:39:13.967]  Fauci magically gets it.
[00:39:14.007 --> 00:39:18.611]  No, he just volunteers to be the guy that fear mongers to kind of change news about himself.
[00:39:18.891 --> 00:39:25.636]  Instead of him being the guy that killed 30-something million people by pushing the poison shots worldwide and being a total liar and saying the shots worked and all the rest of it.
[00:39:26.769 --> 00:39:29.771]  Being behind the creation of gain-of-function in the virus and all the rest of it.
[00:39:29.871 --> 00:39:33.474]  Oh, now, oh, he's been in the hospital secretly for, you know, all these days.
[00:39:33.854 --> 00:39:35.315]  He's got West Nile virus.
[00:39:36.015 --> 00:39:37.216]  But now he's back at home.
[00:39:37.576 --> 00:39:39.037]  Who believes any of this?
[00:39:40.238 --> 00:39:41.879]  So, this new report just went live.
[00:39:41.919 --> 00:39:43.600]  I'm posting it on X right now.
[00:39:44.441 --> 00:39:45.722]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:39:45.742 --> 00:39:47.203]  It broke after I was already on the air.
[00:39:49.865 --> 00:39:52.626]  Bill Gates, mosquitoes, and the October surprise.
[00:39:52.827 --> 00:39:53.187]  Here it is.
[00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:14.263]  Oxford, Massachusetts, and three neighboring towns have a reason for concern as mosquitoes carrying a potentially deadly virus called Eastern Equine Encephalitis, or EEE, infected a resident who is now fighting for his life.
[00:40:14.644 --> 00:40:17.647]  The rare but dangerous disease can cause swelling in the brain.
[00:40:17.727 --> 00:40:20.769]  There's no treatment and anyone can get infected.
[00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:22.511]  The death rate is as high as 30%.
[00:40:23.592 --> 00:40:29.336]  Like, I know they're releasing genetically modified mosquitoes, but, like, airdropping it from a black helicopter?
[00:40:29.936 --> 00:40:32.237]  The GMO mosquitoes are not dying.
[00:40:32.578 --> 00:40:33.558]  They are thriving.
[00:40:33.858 --> 00:40:41.103]  Bill Gates is up to his demonic eugenicist tricks again, bankrolling genocide in Brazil on both sides of the coin.
[00:40:41.383 --> 00:40:50.906]  Further out in the future, we'll actually have gene drive, which changes the genetics of the mosquitoes and either reduces their population or reduces how long they live.
[00:40:51.126 --> 00:40:53.147]  That could have dramatic benefits.
[00:40:53.687 --> 00:41:04.271]  We have great tools today that we need to keep evolving and some very exciting ones in the pipeline, because those will be key to achieve our ultimate goal of eradication.
[00:41:04.611 --> 00:41:17.760]  The UN's World Mosquito Program announced in 2023 a plan to release billions of gene-edited mosquitoes in Brazil over a 10-year period in a bid to eradicate dengue fever in the country.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:23.364]  Rio has registered over 10,000 cases of dengue fever in just over a month.
[00:41:23.584 --> 00:41:23.764]  Here's 2015.
[00:41:24.504 --> 00:41:25.525]  So it was introduced in 2014.
[00:41:25.985 --> 00:41:27.966]  You can see it went up for a couple years and then it dropped.
[00:41:28.046 --> 00:41:29.446]  So it seemed, oh, maybe it's working.
[00:41:29.846 --> 00:41:32.748]  Then it went up again, then it dropped a little, and now it's going back up.
[00:41:33.068 --> 00:41:37.769]  And now we're on a pace to go four times more than this number.
[00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:42.311]  That's where we're on pace for with the first two months of 2024.
[00:41:43.452 --> 00:41:45.152]  So that's 12 million.
[00:41:45.192 --> 00:41:46.713]  See, that's a three million right there.
[00:41:47.153 --> 00:41:47.793]  Three million cases.
[00:41:47.813 --> 00:41:49.154]  Now we're going to be up to 12 million.
[00:41:49.814 --> 00:41:52.515]  But don't worry, they have a vaccine ready now.
[00:41:52.995 --> 00:41:55.056]  So they've created more dengue fever.
[00:41:55.376 --> 00:41:55.656]  Why?
[00:41:55.976 --> 00:41:59.757]  Because the mosquitoes are getting the tetracycline, they're not dying.
[00:42:00.137 --> 00:42:03.178]  Now there's more mosquitoes giving more people dengue fever.
[00:42:03.678 --> 00:42:09.780]  According to the NIH website, programs are being developed to allow human immunization via mosquito bite.
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:14.241]  It was Science Magazine that coined the phrase, flying syringes.
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.320]  You think they can't make you take a shot?
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:17.521]  They're gonna bring troops to your door?
[00:42:17.541 --> 00:42:23.883]  No, they're gonna send mosquitoes to your backyard when you're watering the elephant ears, or when you're getting the groceries out of the back of the car.
[00:42:24.143 --> 00:42:27.984]  I got an article from NPR citing a study, and there's multiple other studies.
[00:42:28.725 --> 00:42:30.365]  They can use mosquitoes.
[00:42:30.405 --> 00:42:33.286]  What they've done is they call them flying syringes, right?
[00:42:33.826 --> 00:42:36.687]  So they genetically modify these mosquitoes.
[00:42:37.387 --> 00:42:42.149]  They bite you, and when a mosquito bites you, well, the stuff that they put back into you
[00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:44.291]  Can act as a vaccine.
[00:42:44.772 --> 00:42:45.312]  There you go.
[00:42:45.712 --> 00:42:51.937]  NPR, you know, they've got these mosquitoes that can vaccinate you against malaria.
[00:42:52.378 --> 00:42:56.401]  So what they do is they take these mosquitoes and they bioengineer them.
[00:42:56.441 --> 00:43:03.046]  They say, well, listen, these mosquitoes that we've bioengineered have malaria, but it can't make you sick.
[00:43:03.675 --> 00:43:03.896]  Right?
[00:43:03.956 --> 00:43:06.300]  They've edited it in a way where that's hilarious.
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:11.749]  Just like he does with the number one cause of the world is Bill Gates's polio vaccine.
[00:43:11.769 --> 00:43:12.991]  It's the number one cause of polio.
[00:43:13.011 --> 00:43:14.053]  Guys, put up Reuters for him.
[00:43:14.454 --> 00:43:15.535]  Is that where you're going with this?
[00:43:16.328 --> 00:43:17.909]  That's exactly where I'm going with it.
[00:43:18.249 --> 00:43:21.311]  Texas is reporting a case of locally transmitted malaria.
[00:43:21.331 --> 00:43:28.074]  It's rare and the first in our state since 1994 and there hasn't been a case of malaria caught locally in the U.S.
[00:43:28.454 --> 00:43:28.674]  since 2003.
[00:43:28.734 --> 00:43:40.801]  The CDC is reporting that these four people from Florida and then another person from Texas contracted this disease between late May and late June through what they're saying is local transmission.
[00:43:40.881 --> 00:43:41.441]  So I did ask
[00:43:41.641 --> 00:43:43.422]  And yes, in 2021, with the financial support of the Gates Foundation,
[00:44:00.987 --> 00:44:13.712]  GlaxoSmithKline developed a malaria vaccine, a clear case of problem-reaction-solution, where once again Bill Gates adds to his massive fortune through nefarious means.
[00:44:14.093 --> 00:44:16.474]  So yes, people are concerned.
[00:44:16.874 --> 00:44:26.238]  Bill Gates has become an American pariah, following his hand in the rollout of COVID vaccines that continue to injure and kill millions of Americans.
[00:44:26.818 --> 00:44:27.938]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.
[00:44:49.827 --> 00:44:52.828]  Many years ago, I coined the term 360Win.
[00:44:53.268 --> 00:44:55.949]  That's another way of saying it's a non-zero-sum game.
[00:44:56.309 --> 00:45:01.090]  When you have a sum game, it's a pizza, there's only so many pieces, it doesn't get bigger.
[00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:07.372]  But if something is symbiotic, if something empowers everybody involved with it, it is a 360Win.
[00:45:07.852 --> 00:45:17.395]  When you visit drjonesnaturals.com, you're not just supporting our broadcast by getting the products, you're getting game-changing products that really, really work and are.
[00:45:17.415 --> 00:45:17.975]  They're amazing.
[00:45:18.556 --> 00:45:19.977]  All of the NanoSilver products.
[00:45:20.317 --> 00:45:35.250]  Incredible products like Next Level Foundational Energy, products like Top Brain, an incredible Nootropic, Rocket Rest, an incredible Natural Sleep Aid, and dozens of other products not available at InfoWorksStore.com or exclusively available at DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:38.653]  And they keep the show on the air, and they're amazing.
[00:45:38.673 --> 00:45:39.373]  A 360 win.
[00:45:39.694 --> 00:45:44.117]  So please, follow the links below to DrJonesNaturals.com, and I thank you for your support.
[00:45:45.058 --> 00:45:57.388]  And for breaking news and updates, be sure and follow me at RealAlexJones, here on X. Alright, so they've already launched the monkeypox hysteria and declared a world emergency, but nobody's buying that.
[00:45:57.408 --> 00:46:10.439]  They tried six months ago, up until right now, to make everybody do PCR tests at farms and poultry facilities, and wear hazmat suits, telling them there's deadly bird flu everywhere, even though all these positives they have on people
[00:46:12.082 --> 00:46:13.403]  Have all been false positives.
[00:46:13.984 --> 00:46:17.988]  So they're trying to create the same old hysteria they did four and a half years ago, but it's not working.
[00:46:18.068 --> 00:46:22.912]  So now Bill Gates is running around releasing all these mosquitoes and trying the same thing.
[00:46:22.972 --> 00:46:30.439]  It's just absolutely insane and totally and completely transparent.
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:33.382]  And they do it over and over again.
[00:46:33.422 --> 00:46:37.006]  That's why it's so important to realize that medicine
[00:46:38.579 --> 00:46:50.423]  And entertainment, establishment entertainment, and big agro, big food is all owned by BlackRock and a handful of families, and they're using it as a control system against people.
[00:46:50.983 --> 00:46:52.104]  Again, they just came out Thursday.
[00:46:52.404 --> 00:47:04.128]  The federal government said, oh, we've been suppressing for many years, 30 years of studies, including new ones, and they just focused on IQ and children and how fluoride makes their IQ drop massively and doesn't protect them.
[00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:06.849]  It also creates infertility, cancer, depression.
[00:47:08.132 --> 00:47:08.552]  You name it.
[00:47:08.712 --> 00:47:10.193]  So that's why what RFK Jr.
[00:47:10.253 --> 00:47:11.434]  is doing is so important.
[00:47:12.214 --> 00:47:13.755]  Here's a clip of RFK Jr.
[00:47:13.855 --> 00:47:16.976]  talking about this on another Fox show, which is just beautiful.
[00:47:17.017 --> 00:47:19.058]  We're seeing the greatest level of education about this.
[00:47:19.078 --> 00:47:20.538]  They're really breaking their backs.
[00:47:20.979 --> 00:47:21.799]  This is clip 11.
[00:47:21.879 --> 00:47:28.522]  Former presidential candidate RFK breaks down the effects of processed foods in American diet in two minutes and 14 seconds.
[00:47:28.682 --> 00:47:30.183]  Short and sweet, but you should.
[00:47:30.203 --> 00:47:31.844]  It's posted on Infowars.com.
[00:47:32.524 --> 00:47:32.904]  You know what?
[00:47:34.565 --> 00:47:37.147]  I see his speech is like an hour and a half long, though, and it was so good.
[00:47:38.174 --> 00:47:48.464]  Maybe you guys can find in his speech, he does it at kind of the middle and the end, and where he talks about we need to save the children, we need to love the children more than we hate each other.
[00:47:48.924 --> 00:47:51.286]  Maybe next hour we should play a few of those clips up front.
[00:47:52.968 --> 00:47:55.931]  Because, I mean, they know the shots are killing them, they know they don't protect them.
[00:47:56.551 --> 00:47:59.034]  It's just, you have to admit they're doing this to you.
[00:47:59.314 --> 00:47:59.975]  Here's RFK Jr.
[00:48:01.313 --> 00:48:05.518]  Yeah, because that is a direct result of corruption.
[00:48:06.479 --> 00:48:16.751]  About 75% of FDA's budget comes from regulated industry, and that means food processors and pharmaceutical industry, all of them profit from a sick population.
[00:48:17.452 --> 00:48:21.295]  In our country, natural flavors are chemical products.
[00:48:22.115 --> 00:48:25.158]  So you can't trust what's on the ingredient label.
[00:48:25.318 --> 00:48:27.819]  And the reason for that, again, is government corruption.
[00:48:27.899 --> 00:48:35.045]  It's that the agency, the USDA, the FDA, have been captured by the industries they're supposed to regulate.
[00:48:36.065 --> 00:48:42.408]  And they all have an interest in subsidies and then in mass poisoning the American public.
[00:48:43.308 --> 00:48:57.113]  As president, I'll issue an executive order on day one that anybody who is recommending food products in USDA or FDA at any of those committees, if you are going to be on those committees, you have to have no conflict of interest.
[00:48:57.333 --> 00:49:03.136]  We spend five times our military budget on chronic disease.
[00:49:04.516 --> 00:49:23.433]  And it's made us the sickest population in the world, and if you wonder why we're the sickest people in the world, why do we have these epidemics of ADHD and depression and all these kinds of psychiatric illnesses that have been linked by the science?
[00:49:24.654 --> 00:49:26.336]  To these kind of foods.
[00:49:26.476 --> 00:49:28.077]  To the ingredients of these foods.
[00:49:28.137 --> 00:49:30.479]  And why do we have these neurological disorders?
[00:49:30.499 --> 00:49:33.301]  All this epidemic of autoimmune disease.
[00:49:33.541 --> 00:49:39.346]  The advisors who actually choose the nutrition guidelines are almost all corrupted.
[00:49:39.406 --> 00:49:40.307]  They're conflicted.
[00:49:40.427 --> 00:49:45.815]  Are you willing to take on a position like this in the Trump administration as Health Czar?
[00:49:46.275 --> 00:49:50.181]  Well, one way or the other, I'm going to be fighting to get this stuff out of our foods.
[00:49:50.201 --> 00:49:51.563]  I mean, we're poisoned.
[00:49:51.583 --> 00:49:55.829]  We have a generation of kids that are swimming around in a toxic soup right now.
[00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:00.952]  And we need to, you know, we're betraying them.
[00:50:01.232 --> 00:50:07.775]  We're supposed to be taking care of our kids and we're letting these industries corrupt our agencies and mass poison them.
[00:50:07.955 --> 00:50:14.678]  And, you know, nobody in the world has a chronic disease epidemic of the kind that we have in this country.
[00:50:16.991 --> 00:50:20.472]  Now folks, you gotta ask yourselves, RFK Jr., now he's getting Trump to do it.
[00:50:20.572 --> 00:50:22.133]  We've been at the tip of the spear for 30 years.
[00:50:23.013 --> 00:50:24.813]  We're saving lives on this broadcast.
[00:50:24.873 --> 00:50:27.054]  We're almost turning the tide of it.
[00:50:27.074 --> 00:50:28.374]  The tide is turning on this.
[00:50:29.675 --> 00:50:32.015]  They're murdering tens of millions of people a year with this garbage.
[00:50:32.716 --> 00:50:34.856]  They're making us sick and unhealthy to control us.
[00:50:35.776 --> 00:50:38.577]  And people are finally facing the full horror of this.
[00:50:39.137 --> 00:50:40.538]  So we cannot do this.
[00:50:42.469 --> 00:50:52.932]  Without your support, that's why when you spread the articles and videos and when you tell your friends and neighbors and family and share the live show feed on your text links and via email and say, hey, this is important.
[00:50:52.952 --> 00:50:54.692]  Tune into this and research it and share it.
[00:50:55.232 --> 00:50:56.352]  People are ready for this now.
[00:50:56.732 --> 00:50:57.773]  That's how we change the world.
