[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.080]  Infowars.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.079]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:32.679]  Today.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.899]  Well, probably just like me, you are amazed.
[00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:40.799]  Not by the fact...
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:52.159]  That absolutely uncivilized means had been used against Trump all the way up to assassination attempts, numerous assassination attempts.
[00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.240]  And I think he's not safe even now.
[00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:10.810]  The history of the United States has known many But I think President Trump is a smart person and a cautious one, I hope.
[00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:27.819]  But what amazed me most, that in fighting him, not only Trump was subjected to humiliating court procedures, accusations,
[00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.700]  and so on.
[00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.640]  But his family was attacked as well.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.079]  His children were attacked.
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.939]  Gangsters don't do this in Russia.
[00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.140]  When criminal gangs fight, they don't touch children and women.
[00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:46.030]  It's men who fight among themselves.
[00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.189]  But those guys stooped as low as that.
[00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.170]  I think this is so...
[00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:05.870]  This looks so bad that it only preaffirms, reconfirms how low the political system of the United States has fallen.
[00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.050]  It is Friday, November 29th, 2024. Thank you for joining us.
[00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.009]  Global Peace Alert.
[00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.430]  Trump set to announce a plan to end the Ukraine war by forcing a ceasefire and stationing Western troops in Ukraine.
[00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.909]  We're going to be breaking down these historic developments here today.
[00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.430]  All right.
[00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.530]  There are a lot of reasons you see the war in Ukraine.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:03:01.580]  But the recent historically dangerous escalations by NATO is predominantly being done because they want to hold a nuclear war gun to the head of the people of the planet.
[00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.020]  Then, of course, the globalists also want world governments.
[00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.180]  They don't want any other sovereign countries they don't control.
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:21.620]  I have been not just reading all the different news developments and things that the corporate media is reporting on or the alternative media that's really the dominant media.
[00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:29.819]  I've also been talking to a lot of sources very close to President Trump and I can tell you exactly what is really going on when we come back.
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.960]  It's pretty important News and information.
[00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:34.539]  A lot of the news we'll cover as well.
[00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.659]  Not just the war front situation.
[00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:51.539]  It is Friday, November 29th, 2024. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.560]  And the great awakening to the New World Order globalist death cult is here.
[00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:02.550]  And if you think they're gonna just go away, think again.
[00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:13.469]  But at least, humanity is becoming aware of just how diabolical these people are, and the awakening and understanding is exponential.
[00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:19.269]  So we are living in a very extraordinary, interesting times.
[00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.410]  Thank you again so much for joining us.
[00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.829]  We are 51 days out from the inauguration of President Trump.
[00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:37.589]  You notice he's been bunkering and hunkering down except for a trip to Texas since the election in Mar-a-Lago, and that is because he is aware of extreme security threats from the deep state.
[00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.389]  Vladimir Putin came out And only talked about 10 minutes.
[00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.810]  The whole thing was extraordinarily interesting and historic.
[00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.689]  And we're going to be going over that today.
[00:04:49.689 --> 00:05:00.029]  Also, we've had statements by General Kellogg, Trump's new chief envoy for a peace deal in Ukraine.
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.259]  And I don't just go off of the corporate media.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.879]  I go off of my sources and contacts.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.040]  And I'm obviously not going to give out any of those sources.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:20.740]  But you'll notice that we are, at least on the war news, months, weeks, days, hours ahead of everything.
[00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:28.579]  So, I can tell you here what the current position is of Russia.
[00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:29.660]  That's public.
[00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:37.649]  What the current position of Zelensky and the NATO globalist leftist neocon hawks are.
[00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:43.930]  What the current position of President Trump is and where we are.
[00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:53.189]  Now, I have neglected in the last few weeks, not completely but to a large extent all the other news.
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.540]  We're good to go.
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:35.800]  But also because it's being used as a pressure point against President Trump and our populist movement to restore control of the federal government and America to the people and to our elected representatives and not to the globalist dehumanization post-industrial destabilization depopulation death cult.
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.360]  So I'm going to hit the military news.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.120]  And then I'm going to get into the big picture and then drill down into it quite a bit here today.
[00:06:49.399 --> 00:07:02.959]  And again, we are live on Friday, November 29th, 2024. You can follow me on X at RealAlexJones and at AJNLive for the Alex Jones Network.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.480]  I'll also give you an update on At the start of the next hour on the future of InfoWars.
[00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:13.240]  I know it's quite a soap opera.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.540]  I know the fight goes on and on and on.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.439]  And that's what the bad guys want to do, is just wear everybody out, wear we just give up.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:33.160]  In fact, just last week at that Monday hearing, where the judge said, and almost no corporate media picked it up, but it hit some of the news, the sale to the onion never happened.
[00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:37.500]  Status quo, Alex Jones is the owner of Free Speech Systems.
[00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:50.100]  And coming up next Monday on the 9th, he's having an evidentiary full hearing on exactly what happened.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.740]  And I can just say it doesn't look good for the feds, the bad guys.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.620]  So that is a pretty big deal right there.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:09.560]  But it is just an emblematic example of how these tyrants have been acting and behaving and doing whatever they want, as if they're above the law for a long time.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:29.959]  But more and more, the public's patience is worn to the point of total resistance, and it's not going the way that But there's been some big developments on that front as well.
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.600]  This is very historic, what's happening.
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.059]  If they're able to get away with this, with InfoWars, they'll be able to get away with it across the board.
[00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:53.000]  But regardless if the bad guys get the website InfoWars.com, regardless of the different activities they're involved in, we're going to continue on here one way or another,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.179]  unless they...
[00:08:56.029 --> 00:09:03.190]  Do a giant cyber attack and blame Russia and implement the internet kill switch and kill Trump and bring in total martial law.
[00:09:04.029 --> 00:09:16.169]  Which is still a very, very, very serious possibility, bordering on probability, if President Trump isn't extremely careful.
[00:09:16.549 --> 00:09:21.289]  Alright, let me just give everybody a summation here of what's going on.
[00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.350]  And this is not my opinion.
[00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.250]  This is what is happening.
[00:09:30.289 --> 00:09:40.610]  And I can tell you in synopsis before I drill through it all that Trump wants peace.
[00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:44.570]  Trump wants a unilateral ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.
[00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:54.529]  Trump is threatening, and that came out last night, which is the main leverage to cut off the money and weapons to Ukraine.
[00:09:54.929 --> 00:10:03.009]  Three weeks ago, Zelensky, on the eve of the election, said, I don't care if America doesn't fund us and Trump gets elected.
[00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:05.090]  We played the clip several times.
[00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.629]  He says, we don't need them.
[00:10:06.789 --> 00:10:08.649]  Well, the United States taxpayer...
[00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.690]  Has been paying for over 85%.
[00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:20.929]  It's around 86% of this giant evil war that's conservatively killed 600,000 troops.
[00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.649]  That's a low number.
[00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:23.950]  Most numbers are around a million.
[00:10:26.809 --> 00:10:39.710]  And if Trump, as the head of the executive branch, Doesn't matter how much money Congress funds for it, he can say that money's not going there.
[00:10:39.909 --> 00:10:49.250]  If Trump pulls the plug on the money to Ukraine, the war ends like turning a light switch off and cutting the electricity to a light bulb.
[00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:54.509]  So, yeah, he said he could end it day one because that's a fact.
[00:10:54.649 --> 00:10:57.870]  And the left and the so-called party, that's ridiculous.
[00:10:58.049 --> 00:10:58.929]  He's so crazy.
[00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.090]  Nobody can do that.
[00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.950]  Two men can have a baby, though.
[00:11:07.379 --> 00:11:22.500]  So, that's his big leverage point, and it came out in the news last night out of Mar-a-Lago that Trump is working with Zelensky, Putin, Stoltenberg, Rutt, Keir Starmer, Macron,
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:29.960]  and of course, the CIA and the State Department telling him this is what's going to happen.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:37.759]  So they have come to Trump and said, fine, we want NATO troops permanently stationed in Ukraine.
[00:11:39.139 --> 00:11:41.879]  Well, Putin has said that's his red line.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.179]  That's why he went there to begin with.
[00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:47.419]  He's already fighting a proxy war undeclared against NATO the last 14 years.
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:55.039]  And so we have the 2014, 2016 troops.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.120]  You have the taking over Crimea.
[00:11:58.809 --> 00:12:09.629]  Then you have three years ago the invasion, three years in February to get that buffer zone in the east and to, quote, demilitarize Ukraine.
[00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:24.889]  So Trump is negotiating to give the Russians roughly a third of Ukraine to be their own military zone of security.
[00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:47.299]  And that then a NATO consortium would be in the west and central area, but there would be an agreement signed officially that heavy weapons and advanced weapons would be banned in Ukraine,
[00:12:48.279 --> 00:13:04.149]  offensive weapons, and that Ukraine would not be made a member of NATO. But then by extension, even if Putin wants to agree to that, NATO's there,
[00:13:04.169 --> 00:13:08.289]  so you've got NATO. And do you think NATO's going to abide by that?
[00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:10.190]  But that's where this is right now.
[00:13:11.429 --> 00:13:14.669]  The Russians aren't waiting for Trump to get in in 51 days.
[00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:17.830]  They have been expanding their buffer zone.
[00:13:18.889 --> 00:13:25.070]  And annihilating the already collapsed NATO-backed Ukrainian forces.
[00:13:25.789 --> 00:13:29.669]  They are feeding mentally retarded people into the meat grinder.
[00:13:29.789 --> 00:13:31.570]  They're feeding young women into it.
[00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:38.370]  The average age of the soldier is now 55. They're feeding 60, 70-year-old men into it.
[00:13:38.909 --> 00:13:45.830]  The globalists are fighting to the last dead Ukrainian and Russian people.
[00:13:47.570 --> 00:14:00.289]  And the big issue here is, will the whole globalist system in the next 50 plus days continue to bomb Russia with strategic, high-powered, precision, nuclear-capable missiles?
[00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:05.850]  Which is a major nuclear provocation, because you never know when they're going to swap them out for nukes and hit Russia with a sneak attack.
[00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:11.769]  And you've got NATO last week saying maybe we should hit Russia with a sneak attack to be provocative to Russia.
[00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:13.929]  Extreme provocation.
[00:14:16.019 --> 00:14:22.779]  So we saw that build up towards provocation escalation last week into this week.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.960]  And General Flynn was here on Monday.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:33.879]  And we said we would expect Trump by the eve of Thanksgiving or the latest Thanksgiving to start putting out a peace proposal.
[00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:38.059]  And that of course is what Flynn had been hearing from his sources.
[00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:41.580]  He talks to Trump all the time obviously but won't speak about that.
[00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:43.710]  And many other sources.
[00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:45.909]  I've got a lot of calls from Mar-a-Lago.
[00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:53.190]  Tuesday, Wednesday, and last night about the intense debates going on.
[00:14:53.850 --> 00:15:03.350]  Trump came out last night for a little Thanksgiving dinner celebration and sang a little YMCA with Elon Musk about footage of that.
[00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:12.129]  But other than that, he has been diligently, I'm told, up to 16 hours a day on the phone with world leaders trying to get this deal done.
[00:15:13.909 --> 00:15:15.549]  So, those are the pieces.
[00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:20.870]  Then, today, it began to break what I was just talking about.
[00:15:21.169 --> 00:15:27.629]  West is planning on freezing conflict in Ukraine and stationing troops there.
[00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.929]  Putin slams U.S. political system targeting Trump, says Trump isn't safe.
[00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.889]  We've got Trump working on Ukraine.
[00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:41.389]  Russian ceasefire ahead of inauguration as globalist Pupin Zelensky resists peace talks.
[00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:50.840]  It's now official that Trump is telling Zelensky that all U.S. funds and weapons will be cut off if he doesn't go to the peace table.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.419]  We'll go through more of this in detail here in a moment.
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:02.179]  Incoming Trump administration closing in on Ukraine peace deal with indefinite hold on NATO membership.
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.360]  Then we have President Putin slams U.S. government for treating Donald Trump unfairly.
[00:16:08.419 --> 00:16:09.159]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.460]  Another clip of Putin.
[00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:16.899]  President Putin says Russia will not allow Ukraine to obtain nuclear weapons.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.799]  R.O.K. Jr.'s had a good breakdown of what's really happening there.
[00:16:24.379 --> 00:16:41.220]  Also, this is a really important clip I want to play because I'm not trying to attack Trump's new peace envoy, General Kellogg, but In this little five and a half minute clip,
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.120]  he is so contradictory.
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.899]  And that is the schizophrenia of this policy.
[00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:51.139]  He says it's incredibly dangerous.
[00:16:51.139 --> 00:16:53.100]  It could blow the whole world up any time.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.639]  We don't want to escalate this.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:02.559]  But it's, you know, wonderful that Biden has started, along with others, bombing Russia.
[00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:07.779]  That'll help Trump bring him to the negotiating table.
[00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:30.789]  I, in my experience in studying history and a lot of negotiations that have gone on in recent history and more remote history and ancient history is most of the time big escalations with other big high-powered organizations and countries does not end in I mean,
[00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:42.029]  if Russia moved missiles to our border and overthrew a country next door to us and then started firing nuclear-capable missiles, blowing up U.S. military bases, do you think that would make the United States negotiate with the Russians?
[00:17:42.349 --> 00:17:42.809]  No.
[00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.049]  The United States would blow Russia off the map.
[00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:50.089]  So we're all just keep hoping that the Russians aren't like us.
[00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:56.190]  And I can tell you that they are.
[00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:14.130]  But they've been attacked and invaded more than anybody in history, so they are refraining, but they have tested an intermediate-range ICBM or ballistic missile with MIRV technology,
[00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:18.950]  and Kellogg talks about that.
[00:18:19.329 --> 00:18:26.950]  Now, Trump's national security advisor, Waltz, Came out this week on Monday and said we need to de-escalate now.
[00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:31.289]  We are already entering full war and world war.
[00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:32.369]  You hear that?
[00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:33.190]  Already entering.
[00:18:33.349 --> 00:18:35.130]  I read the quote Wednesday here several times.
[00:18:35.289 --> 00:18:36.210]  I'll pull it back up if you want.
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:42.619]  He made a public statement, put out a statement, and said, we're already in World War.
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.619]  And now the Russians, Putin, by the way, said that yesterday.
[00:18:46.279 --> 00:18:49.579]  He's now in a state of war with the West, and he's a stop.
[00:18:50.339 --> 00:18:53.640]  The MI6 former head came out Wednesday and said that too.
[00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:57.119]  Of course, the former head of the Ukrainian military said it last week.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.440]  I said it before that.
[00:18:58.619 --> 00:19:00.680]  I mean, I said, you'll soon see them announce it, because...
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.779]  It's a threat escalation ladder of doctrine.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.000]  So it's not like it's hard for me to know that.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:11.960]  I just sit here and go, why is no one announcing that this is direct war between Russia and NATO and we're a NATO member?
[00:19:12.539 --> 00:19:14.279]  80 plus percent of NATO strength.
[00:19:15.119 --> 00:19:19.160]  That's why we contribute 85 percent to the operation in Ukraine.
[00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:21.099]  That's all in treaty agreements.
[00:19:22.039 --> 00:19:24.859]  So my frustration is this is all...
[00:19:27.389 --> 00:19:29.009]  Very simple, really.
[00:19:29.349 --> 00:19:34.109]  And that's why Biden said a few years ago, he said, we can't give them F-16s and Abrams tanks.
[00:19:34.269 --> 00:19:41.309]  That goes up the escalation ladder, and that's World War III. Well, then, why did you go ahead and do it?
[00:19:41.849 --> 00:19:43.569]  Because they've convinced themselves...
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.720]  That Russia isn't going to respond.
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:56.980]  And yes, for 20 plus years, Russia put up with the West encroaching, taking over country after country, trying to destabilize them internally, trying to put in leftist Soros operatives.
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:04.700]  Soros went on when he could still talk three years ago on CNN again and said, I am basically the czar of Russia.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.220]  I run Russia and soon we will overthrow them.
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:12.779]  And it's all meant to just goad and poke, poke, poke, poke the bear.
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.940]  And these globalists are trying to drag us into a full war with Russia.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.900]  Everybody already knows that.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.140]  I'm just stating the obvious here.
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.180]  And this is insane, because I'm going to explain it again.
[00:20:23.579 --> 00:20:28.099]  NATO made a deal in 1992 to not expand one inch eastward.
[00:20:28.359 --> 00:20:29.240]  The Russians made a deal.
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.039]  They followed it.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.240]  Then the West went in and set up oligarchs and looted Russia.
[00:20:34.339 --> 00:20:35.599]  Then Russia kicked most of them out.
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.519]  And then in the mid-90s, the Clintons started bombing Serbia.
[00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:41.740]  They just went down the line attacking Russia.
[00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:46.690]  And encircling Russia, and no one would put up with that.
[00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:48.170]  No one.
[00:20:49.529 --> 00:20:52.369]  So, I don't like starting fights with anybody.
[00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:59.630]  I don't like, you know, walk into a restaurant, I'm in a bad mood, and I see some little guy, so I go over and grab him by the back of the neck, because I can beat him up.
[00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:10.390]  And I sure as hell, you know, don't go to a, let's say a police station, and pull a gun out and start shooting at it, because the cops are going to kill me.
[00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:11.309]  Plus, I don't want to do that anyways.
[00:21:12.069 --> 00:21:19.789]  But this is like walking up to a police station and just randomly you just start shooting into the windows with it.
[00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.150]  You're going to get shot real fast.
[00:21:23.049 --> 00:21:26.630]  Or pull up to the entrance to a military base and start shooting at the guard station.
[00:21:26.769 --> 00:21:27.630]  You're going to get killed.
[00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:31.769]  You might get one or two of them, but you're going to be dead real fast.
[00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:37.170]  Okay, well this is a lot worse than a military army guard installation or a Marine Corps base.
[00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:42.690]  This is a lot worse than going to the White House and spraying bullets at it, which I'm not saying do, but you get shot real quick.
[00:21:42.829 --> 00:21:44.710]  Or one of the FBI headquarters is doing that.
[00:21:45.349 --> 00:21:53.529]  This is literally messing with the people that have the biggest nuclear weapons arsenal in the world, and on record the fastest hypersonic missiles and a shit ton of them.
[00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:59.750]  So, I mean, you know, I don't go beat up little wimps because I don't need to feel powerful, and that's wrong.
[00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:00.849]  I have no desire to do it.
[00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:14.369]  And I sure as hell don't walk up to, let's say, the UFC heavyweight champion, Mr. Jones, and just, while he's eating dinner with his wife, and just slap him across the face.
[00:22:14.509 --> 00:22:16.410]  He's going to get up and put me in a coma.
[00:22:19.229 --> 00:22:20.869]  So, this is insane.
[00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:25.109]  And I know I've said that a lot, but we're going to go to break here in a few minutes.
[00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:28.869]  And I'm going to come back.
[00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:33.269]  And I'm going to get into all the news.
[00:22:34.849 --> 00:22:38.869]  So, the bottom line is this.
[00:22:40.009 --> 00:22:41.890]  Trump is following through on what he did.
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:49.400]  He's got the deep state globalists that have tried to kill him twice, that have tried to put him in prison, that have been all this craziness.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:54.240]  He knows full well he is playing with some very dangerous people.
[00:22:55.839 --> 00:22:59.480]  And Trump always follows through on his promises.
[00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:02.720]  Even when he's wrong about something, he never stops.
[00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:04.119]  Which is only wrong about a few things.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.759]  But when he says something, you can bet that's what he's planning.
[00:23:08.829 --> 00:23:10.349]  He likes people to know that.
[00:23:10.589 --> 00:23:12.589]  And that's a real power, by the way.
[00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.849]  His real power is you say something and you mean it and you do it.
[00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:17.789]  And people respect that and you get stuff done.
[00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:23.970]  So, we've heard some spin from Kellogg and people that was very...
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:38.299]  Disconcerting Wednesday, and I did reports on that, implying Trump is behind the bombing of Russia as a negotiation point, and that's now been repudiated in statements that have come out of Mar-a-Lago.
[00:23:39.859 --> 00:23:52.000]  And so Trump is trying to get Zelensky to come to the table before he gets in, promising Zelensky, we are going to really spank your ass and come after you for your corruption if you don't do this.
[00:23:52.119 --> 00:23:55.220]  I'm the new boss, not the globalist that put you in, puppet.
[00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.309]  And we'll let you run off with your Miami billions.
[00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:02.430]  You're poorly stolen, like at least two billion himself.
[00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:04.950]  We'll let you have your stolen goodies.
[00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:07.329]  But I'm the new boss, you little bastard.
[00:24:09.329 --> 00:24:13.109]  So you can go play piano with your ding-dong and stuff after this instead of being in a prison.
[00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:17.410]  You can wear your high heels and, you know, make out with dudes and everything.
[00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:18.289]  But...
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.940]  You're going to do what we say.
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:21.759]  I've been elected.
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:22.539]  I have a mandate.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.019]  Do it.
[00:24:23.339 --> 00:24:27.819]  Don't make me wait 51 days to get in office and then cut the weapons off to your ass.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.759]  We're going to do this.
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:34.339]  And then we'll rebuild you and all the rest of it, which is more taxpayer money.
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:40.519]  But it won't be one-tenth as expensive as this war, and it will not be as expensive as a nuclear war.
[00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:43.029]  And people say, well, Trump need to put him in president.
[00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:44.549]  Nope, not one more dollar for them.
[00:24:45.349 --> 00:24:47.609]  Trump has to get the Ukrainians on board.
[00:24:47.769 --> 00:24:49.150]  He has to get Putin on board.
[00:24:49.289 --> 00:24:57.829]  He has to promise and sign an agreement that NATO won't put offensive weapons in there.
[00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.029]  They're going to turn it into a demilitarized zone.
[00:25:00.329 --> 00:25:03.529]  This is what happens when big powers come together and make a deal.
[00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:08.740]  Every time countries get divided up, Ukraine's been divided up over and over again in history.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.579]  That's why so many wars have been fought there, and history's repeating itself.
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:18.339]  So that's how you get a deal done, and that's what Trump's trying to do.
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.180]  If it doesn't happen, the Russians are going to continue to double down.
[00:25:24.019 --> 00:25:39.490]  They're going to continue to blow the daylights out of Ukraine, and This new Northern Alliance, that's not the Taliban, it's a new Northern Alliance, run by the UK and others,
[00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:41.430]  is going to continue fighting the Russians.
[00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:50.609]  And then they're going to pull false flags off and a bunch of other crap and just try to continue to get us into World War III. So, that's the deal Trump's doing behind the scenes.
[00:25:51.599 --> 00:25:53.160]  And it's going to be hard to get that done.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:56.440]  But it's a lot easier than blowing the world up.
[00:25:57.059 --> 00:26:03.160]  I'm going to go through some more details of this place, some of the clips I mentioned, and then talk about the dangers of Trump and a lot more.
[00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:05.240]  Why is Putin warning him that he believes he's in imminent danger?
[00:26:05.539 --> 00:26:07.799]  Well, General Flynn said that on Monday, because Trump is.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:08.900]  We'll be right back.
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:09.380]  Stay with us.
[00:26:09.859 --> 00:26:12.119]  We've been through a lot at Infowars.
[00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:14.819]  America and the world has been through hell.
[00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:16.319]  But the Great Awakening is here.
[00:26:16.539 --> 00:26:18.339]  The globalists are in full panic mode.
[00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:31.059]  And now it's more important than ever to keep the most powerful, effective voices at exposing the globalist agenda and promoting the team humanity agenda on air.
[00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:40.049]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, is owned by Great Patriots and some of the top makers of Patriot apparel.

[00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.650]  We have two new campaign coins.

[00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:17.289]  One is the answer to 1984 is $17.76.
[00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:21.289]  And on one side, it's got the Gadsden flag.
[00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:24.490]  On the other side, it's got yours truly.
[00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:36.670]  The other great coin is 1776 limited edition coin with a Gadsden flag, don't tread on me, and 1776. Both are powerful coins, powerful coins.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:37.880]  Messages.
[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.039]  They weigh a lot.
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:39.720]  They feel good.
[00:27:39.839 --> 00:27:40.539]  They're a great gift.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.400]  They're a great memento.
[00:27:42.539 --> 00:27:43.640]  They're a great keepsake.
[00:27:43.779 --> 00:27:45.680]  They're a great conversation starter.
[00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:52.819]  And both these coins are $14.97 at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.319]  We can't do this without you.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.960]  We want to sell you products you love so you come back again and again.
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.500]  Thanks for keeping us in the fight.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.519]  Please visit thealexjonesstore.com today and get the campaign coins.
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:27.660]  All right, these are really stunning clips from Vladimir Putin and from General Keith Kellogg that I'm going to get to here in a moment, then we're going to analyze the Russian president warning that Trump's life is in danger.
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.720]  What information do they have?
[00:28:29.819 --> 00:28:37.880]  You heard General Flynn in here Monday, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, saying they're going to try to kill Trump in the next few weeks.
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.160]  And that's the information he's getting.
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:47.900]  So, there's a lot of celebrating going on, a lot of people having a great time, thinking everything's okay.
[00:28:48.539 --> 00:28:53.220]  We just won a major battle, huge historic battle against the globalists.
[00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:56.119]  And culturally, we're running the tables on them.
[00:28:56.299 --> 00:28:58.759]  The whole world's starting to wake up and getting pissed.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.599]  Populars are being elected everywhere.
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.940]  Their entire New World Order agenda is in tatters.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.519]  And if you study these people's mindsets, what do they do when that happens?
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.579]  They will create a giant crisis or crises.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.319]  So we better be watching everything they're doing and what they're pre-programming.
[00:29:15.859 --> 00:29:17.119]  And that's what we do here.
[00:29:17.299 --> 00:29:19.539]  So I'll get to all of this critical information in a moment.
[00:29:19.759 --> 00:29:22.200]  But that's why this broadcast is so important.
[00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:25.650]  That's why they want me off the air.
[00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:27.950]  I'm not a regular talk show host.
[00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:35.930]  I have the deep state, and I don't know if it's true, but it's in the transcript at the court hearing this Monday.
[00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:36.950]  I keep saying last Monday.
[00:29:37.009 --> 00:29:37.789]  It feels like it's Monday.
[00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:38.349]  It's Friday.
[00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:39.769]  It's Thanksgiving holiday.
[00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:53.440]  They said in court this Monday, five days ago, Oh, Your Honor, we've spent $316 million suing Alex Jones the last seven years.
[00:29:54.519 --> 00:30:00.460]  The Democrat Party law firms, literally the law firms represent Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, the same ones that have sued Trump.
[00:30:01.319 --> 00:30:06.019]  And we want those fees tacked on, and the judge said no to that.
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:14.119]  Now, I don't know if they really spent $300 million suing me, but they had said $80 million before.
[00:30:15.469 --> 00:30:17.849]  Now, does that sound like a normal show to you?
[00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:19.509]  Does that sound like something that's not important?
[00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:22.450]  They can't stand this broadcast.
[00:30:22.609 --> 00:30:34.490]  Their bosses cannot stand this show because when the globalists tune in from the State Department and the CIA and MI6 and the EU and NATO, they go, this guy knows everything about us.
[00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:36.650]  Yeah, they're child trafficking.
[00:30:38.349 --> 00:30:39.589]  They're drug dealing.
[00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.490]  They're globalist, transhumanist religion.
[00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:46.109]  Well, of course I know what they do.
[00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:47.549]  They've shot their mouths off.
[00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:49.650]  We know their operations.
[00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:54.730]  So the bad guys want this show off the air.
[00:30:55.829 --> 00:31:03.809]  So how have we held them off and fought them and now having victories that you don't see in the news legally?
[00:31:06.099 --> 00:31:07.339]  With $16 million.
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:15.220]  That's how much money we've spent in the last almost seven years of your money that you sent in to us buying products.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.099]  That's the chunk we've spent illegal.
[00:31:18.819 --> 00:31:27.180]  My dad, they sued the living hell out of the last two years, claiming he was hiding money and was a criminal and all this crap.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.180]  Audits, court attacks, and of course my dad was totally, everything he said was true.
[00:31:33.339 --> 00:31:34.460]  Didn't have a bunch of money.
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:42.660]  And most of the money he spent was money he had from retirement from what he'd done as a doctor.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:50.359]  So we have total skin in the game, the Jones family, for you.
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.180]  Because if you're going to be free, I'm going to be free.
[00:31:53.259 --> 00:31:54.420]  If I'm going to be free, you've got to be free.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.880]  I mean, I think about you like you're myself.
[00:31:57.789 --> 00:32:05.309]  And finally America got off the bench, donated to Trump, voted, spoke out, and we overrode their fraud in a landslide.
[00:32:05.309 --> 00:32:09.130]  It would have been a total landslide without all the baked-in fraud, just as I told you.
[00:32:10.009 --> 00:32:17.589]  Well, it takes the same thing with word of mouth, with prayer, with sharing the clips, sharing the articles, and a lot of you are doing it.
[00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:19.829]  It's why we're reaching tens of millions of new people today.
[00:32:19.849 --> 00:32:20.529]  Great job.
[00:32:23.019 --> 00:32:28.920]  But when it comes to the Department of Finances, it's very frustrating because I know the economy's shot.
[00:32:29.559 --> 00:32:31.519]  That's the biggest reason we have trouble raising funds.
[00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:32.240]  I get it.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.619]  The economy's good.
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.359]  We have no problem to have plenty of money to fight these people.
[00:32:38.819 --> 00:32:44.259]  So you think I want to get up here and heartfelt to sit here and explain this to you when I've got all this other news to hit?
[00:32:44.339 --> 00:32:44.759]  No, I don't.
[00:32:46.369 --> 00:32:48.190]  So we try to make it easy for you to support.
[00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:51.289]  You really want the supplements at the AlexShieldStore.com.
[00:32:51.289 --> 00:32:52.509]  They really are game-changing.
[00:32:52.609 --> 00:32:53.269]  They really do work.
[00:32:53.329 --> 00:32:54.049]  They really are amazing.
[00:32:54.569 --> 00:32:59.650]  The t-shirts, hundreds and hundreds of great designs of ball caps, t-shirts, hoodies.
[00:32:59.789 --> 00:33:00.769]  I mean, they're just amazing.
[00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:03.390]  So proud of them, with our great sponsor, the AlexShieldStore.
[00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:05.730]  Which, again, is not owned by me.
[00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:09.049]  Even if the bad guys are able to get InfoWars, they have no claim on that.
[00:33:09.089 --> 00:33:11.150]  It will continue on as our sponsor at the AlexShieldStore.
[00:33:13.829 --> 00:33:15.930]  So now is the time to take action.
[00:33:16.049 --> 00:33:19.410]  The Alex Jones gear, the Patriot gear, the 1776 gear.
[00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:27.410]  I'd put it in Trump gear, Alex Jones M4 gear, and Patriot 1776 founding father type stuff.
[00:33:27.569 --> 00:33:28.549]  That's my favorite gear.
[00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:31.170]  And funny, the stuff I like the best is the best selling.
[00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:37.309]  It goes Patriot gear, Alex Jones gear, it's the same thing, but, you know, with myself, Remforz on it.
[00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.410]  And then the Trump gear.
[00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:42.650]  And these are, it's great Trump gear, but quite frankly, the Trump, well, that shirt's really popular right there.
[00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:45.750]  Trump, better coverage than Verizon, now do you hear us.
[00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.849]  But, no, the Trump gear is the least popular category.
[00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:53.450]  People like the anti-New World Order, pro-America stuff.
[00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:56.650]  That's what I guess would be most popular, and that's what's most popular.
[00:33:57.910 --> 00:33:59.930]  I would think Team Humanity would be very popular.
[00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:00.390]  It's not.
[00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:02.009]  That's what we are on.
[00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:06.890]  So, there is a big sale going on right now.
[00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:12.050]  You can get three shirts or three hats for 40% off.
[00:34:12.289 --> 00:34:12.969]  That's a huge deal.
[00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.750]  Biggest sale yet.
[00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.150]  Two hoodies for 35% off.
[00:34:17.329 --> 00:34:17.849]  They're high quality.
[00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.989]  Ultimate supplement bundle for 30% off.
[00:34:22.269 --> 00:34:31.289]  And VIP members will get sent a link to claim their $30 to $50, depending on the person's random, of free gifts.
[00:34:34.269 --> 00:34:40.550]  That is here in just the next couple days.
[00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:41.750]  Then that ends.
[00:34:42.309 --> 00:34:46.349]  So there's different specials every few days.
[00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:51.309]  And that is the special right now.
[00:34:52.309 --> 00:34:57.489]  Also, there is Black Friday Cyber Monday.
[00:34:57.889 --> 00:35:02.510]  Right now, 25% off site-wide on top of all the discounts.
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.760]  And so some of these are lost leaders now, so I should have told you about that.
[00:35:07.099 --> 00:35:09.760]  It's just automatic at checkout on top of the other specials.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.579]  That's insane.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:16.460]  That's why the owner of the company was here last week, and he said, he said, Alex, you say we do two to get discounts.
[00:35:16.639 --> 00:35:17.599]  Sometimes they're not enough profit.
[00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:18.679]  He goes, we're really going to hate this.
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:19.300]  Yeah.
[00:35:20.239 --> 00:35:29.300]  But their thought is you're going to love the product so much, you will get addicted to the Ultimate CMOS. What it does, your energy, stamina, libido, focus, clarity, health.

[00:35:31.579 --> 00:35:33.380]  People see how my skin glows, so much energy.
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.360]  It's just amazing.
[00:35:35.679 --> 00:35:40.800]  And then, as I said, also all those other specials and more.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.420]  So 25% off on top of everything.

[00:35:56.130 --> 00:36:07.690]  And VIP members will be emailed the link where you'll either have $30, $40, or $50 extra on top of the $40 you get a month being a VIP to spend on the store for $30 a month you spend.
[00:36:07.889 --> 00:36:10.170]  Then you get all those other great specials, cancel anytime.
[00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:12.769]  So there's that.
[00:36:14.219 --> 00:36:16.599]  All at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:17.059]  Okay.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.300]  Let me start over now.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:39.980]  There is a global, corporate, Rothschild, British Empire, U.S. Empire system called the Anglo-American establishment in their own white papers.
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:41.840]  Doesn't mean white people.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:46.059]  It goes off the Anglo-American oil, Anglo-American East India Company.
[00:36:46.219 --> 00:36:47.260]  It's the corporate name.
[00:36:47.579 --> 00:36:49.619]  And it goes back to William the Conqueror.
[00:36:49.659 --> 00:36:51.000]  And it's a long history lesson.
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:57.599]  But it was a group of Vikings that took over Western Europe about a thousand years ago.
[00:36:58.059 --> 00:37:02.119]  And then they took over what is England in the next hundred years.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:08.260]  And the Russians have back and forth been fighting with them for a thousand years.
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:12.880]  So Putin, in speeches all the time, refers to the Anglo-American Empire.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.500]  Because he actually talks to them who they are.
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:22.679]  The Rothschilds in 1215 at the Battle of Runnymede, or was it 1214?
[00:37:22.679 --> 00:37:23.699]  Look it up, my memory fails.
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:28.840]  Were able to crash the British stock market claiming that Napoleon had won and buy it up for $99.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:36.659]  You know, cents of the dollar, bought it for like one, literally one, it went down by 99%.
[00:37:36.659 --> 00:37:42.800]  They were able to buy almost the whole thing up, and then they became the heads of the British Empire, and that's where you get this whole system since then.
[00:37:44.559 --> 00:37:48.559]  And you got the Chinese with their own system, and you've got the Russians with theirs.
[00:37:48.719 --> 00:37:53.599]  The Chi-Coms were created by the globalists, put in power in 49%.
[00:37:55.559 --> 00:38:13.940]  Built up by the 90s, given almost all of our industry and jobs, they had a deal to not be militarily expansive and expansionist, but they could be the hegemonic client of the globalist and control all the rare earth metals and things and be the dominant engine of the world.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:25.900]  But the CHICOMs about 13, 14 years ago double-crossed the globalist And by about 12 years ago, it was a public rift and the Asia pivot by Obama, and the rest is history.
[00:38:26.539 --> 00:38:39.219]  So it's the Russians, the Chinese, and the Anglo-American establishment, and the European Union's kind of a bastardized subset elite that's all mixed in with the Anglo-American establishment.
[00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:43.960]  The Anglo-American establishment...
[00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:52.280]  It's been dominating since the end of World War II. It was super dominant by the early 1990s with the fall of the Soviet Union.
[00:38:54.099 --> 00:38:59.860]  And then through BlackRock and the private banks, it was able to basically take over almost all the finances of the world.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:12.119]  And you see it's programmed to domesticate, dumb people down, make them manageable, controllable, to then kind of ease people into the anesthetization of depopulation.
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:21.000]  Now with China breaking up with the globalists and then Russia not going along with the globalists.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:31.159]  And now with the globalists launching all these wars driving China and Russia together, which goes against smart policy if you actually care about the West.
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:37.880]  And then the West evil anti-human death cult ideology of attacking families and children and transhumanism.
[00:39:38.019 --> 00:39:41.780]  That's totally turned the Russians and Chinese against the West as well.
[00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:49.070]  And so the West controllers want to inject their social poison into the world.
[00:39:51.469 --> 00:39:57.409]  But at the same time, if the world doesn't get totally poisoned by it and rejects it, it just makes them stronger.
[00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:59.230]  It's now made us weaker.
[00:39:59.469 --> 00:40:00.250]  We're falling apart.
[00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:02.949]  And so in a giant game of brinksmanship...
[00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:21.289]  They've been trying to basically lure Russia into a first nuclear strike, and the globalists are willing, if the Russians do it, to then say that their hands are clean in the West and then use that to try to stay on top of a post-nuclear war hellscape.
[00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.489]  Now, if that isn't dystopian, I don't know what is.
[00:40:28.239 --> 00:40:30.380]  So Trump doesn't want to blow the world up.
[00:40:30.559 --> 00:40:31.619]  Trump isn't psychotic.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.019]  Trump isn't a megalomaniac.
[00:40:33.179 --> 00:40:36.940]  Trump wants business and success and progress and expansion.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.340]  So does Elon Musk.
[00:40:39.659 --> 00:40:49.519]  They represent laissez-faire libertarian capitalism that should be the dominant force in the world and his Western creation.
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.219]  And that is the real fight.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.159]  There is a civil war between the elites in the West.
[00:40:55.699 --> 00:41:02.400]  Do they go to the doomsday death cult operation that any sane person should be 100% against?
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:07.280]  Or do we stabilize the West and then just move forward through economic dominance?
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.340]  And then the elites over here will still be in charge.
[00:41:09.579 --> 00:41:17.440]  It's just that we're not going to cut little boys dicks off and we're not going to have pedophilia legalized and we're not going to make everybody drink fluoride.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:18.840]  It's just horrible.
[00:41:20.099 --> 00:41:28.000]  It's a eugenicist, death cult, depopulationist, new world order, green cult, transhumanist nightmare.
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.460]  It's dystopia by design.
[00:41:30.139 --> 00:41:51.119]  And so, it should be easy to defeat this when you ideologically admit what it is, admit how crazy, evil it is, admit it's happening, and then just expose it, withdraw support from it, And then tell the establishment people that are trying to do this nuclear banksmanship and all the rest of it,
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.960]  look, we don't want to kill you.
[00:41:54.099 --> 00:41:55.099]  We don't want to put you in prison.
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:42:01.679]  But if you're going to try to blow the world up and kill all of us, we're going to have to really knock some heads here.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:07.800]  So people are really coming to the awakening that, wow, this is real tyranny.
[00:42:10.439 --> 00:42:12.780]  And, I mean, I'm going to play some of this today.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:13.880]  I didn't get to it Wednesday.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.639]  I will today.
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.440]  Rogan's been having, like, huge billionaire top tech people on.
[00:42:21.159 --> 00:42:24.599]  And they're just like, look, there's a world government run by the big banks.
[00:42:24.619 --> 00:42:25.920]  And they want to enslave everybody.
[00:42:26.119 --> 00:42:27.659]  And, hey, I'll control everything you do.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.159]  And they want to cut the resources off and have no competition.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.340]  And it's really horrible.
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.559]  And I've been in the big meetings with them.
[00:42:32.659 --> 00:42:34.980]  And I just, you know, I can't be part of this.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.780]  And a lot of us at Silicon Valley, in fact, the majority now, just have decided to go against it.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:39.199]  We have to.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:39.800]  It's just too evil.
[00:42:42.059 --> 00:42:44.199]  And Rogan's like, wow, this is...
[00:42:44.199 --> 00:42:47.420]  I'm talking to Rogan today.
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:50.500]  He's just like, you can't believe everything I said is completely exactly how I said it.
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:51.260]  I'm like, yeah.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.659]  You need to meet with well-known billionaires that are in the meetings to see this.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.179]  Know this.
[00:42:56.239 --> 00:42:58.460]  This is really that bad, Joe.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.579]  He's like, wow, it really is all true.
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:01.179]  Yeah.
[00:43:01.539 --> 00:43:08.920]  It's just hard for people who aren't psychotic megalomaniacs to see it going on and say, why would you do...
[00:43:10.159 --> 00:43:12.340]  If you're rich and powerful, why would you want to blow everything up?
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:15.699]  But it's the nature of these psychos.
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:20.280]  And they all get around each other in the Pentagon and the banks.
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.280]  Well, we're the power.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.860]  We can push Russia.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.539]  Russia is bluffing.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.699]  And it just gets worse and worse and worse.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.340]  And that's how escalation happens.
[00:43:33.559 --> 00:43:33.780]  So...
[00:43:34.699 --> 00:43:50.320]  It's the forces of stability and sanity and life and self-preservation and people that like their grandkids and like their kids and like their wives and like their husbands and like playing golf and like seeing movies and like eating barbecue and, you know,
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.980]  like going to a ball game and like going to church and just want to be, you know, hey...
[00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:56.969]  We're not that we're wimps or something.
[00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:57.510]  We've got to fight.
[00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:57.969]  We'll fight.
[00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:00.329]  But the bad guys are running our government.
[00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:02.570]  The bad guys are running the big corporations.
[00:44:02.769 --> 00:44:03.269]  They're bad.
[00:44:03.489 --> 00:44:04.389]  I mean, they're real bad.
[00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:05.909]  Just go read their writings.
[00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:06.750]  Read their policies.
[00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:12.550]  I mean, they knew full well those COVID shots would turn off immune systems and sterilize and kill a bunch of people.
[00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:14.230]  That's mainstream news.
[00:44:14.429 --> 00:44:17.329]  Giant Harvard-Oxford study just came out.
[00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:20.269]  Wednesday.
[00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:21.230]  I got them right here.
[00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:29.190]  That 25 million people have been killed by the shots off the British government's own numbers, which is a snapshot of the British population, their death.
[00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:31.610]  Then you extrapolate it out.
[00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:36.230]  They have similar numbers from other countries, but they just looked at their numbers and then extrapolated out.
[00:44:37.329 --> 00:44:47.969]  But 1.7 million kids and teens that got the Pfizer shot alone found to have myocarditis only in vax groups.
[00:44:50.139 --> 00:44:51.940]  Upwards of 30 million dead worldwide.
[00:44:53.179 --> 00:44:56.739]  Upwards of 300 million now with serious heart problems from the shots.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:08.800]  That's just a snapshot of 40% of the kids that took it that are in a database, government database in the UK. That's a big sample though, 40% of the kids.
[00:45:10.159 --> 00:45:11.239]  Got it through the government.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:12.860]  So they're in a government database.
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:17.539]  They went and looked and compared their medical records, just like New Zealand did six months ago.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.480]  The head of their program leaked it.
[00:45:19.579 --> 00:45:21.360]  They're trying to put him in prison as a hero.
[00:45:21.679 --> 00:45:24.119]  I mean, this is hardcore stuff.
[00:45:25.139 --> 00:45:27.539]  I mean, again, you're a TV or radio listener.
[00:45:27.639 --> 00:45:28.619]  You look at all these stacks.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.860]  This is not props here.
[00:45:30.539 --> 00:45:37.340]  I mean, just the clips of billionaire tech titans going public about the plan to totally enslave you and kill you.
[00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:40.630]  That would take an hour to cover properly.
[00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:41.849]  And you know what?
[00:45:41.909 --> 00:45:42.489]  We're going to do it.
[00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:51.250]  So, I said I'd finish up the war news, but I really can't do it justice right now.
[00:45:51.389 --> 00:45:54.130]  I mean, we're seven minutes to break, so I'm going to go ahead and start it now.
[00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:57.989]  It'll take me maybe 15 minutes the next hour to finish up.
[00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:00.090]  And then I'm going to leave that chapter.
[00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:01.309]  I'm hosting all four hours today.
[00:46:02.809 --> 00:46:03.849]  I'll be here until 3 p.m.
[00:46:03.949 --> 00:46:04.190]  Central.
[00:46:04.369 --> 00:46:05.849]  Head of Owen Schroer coming in 3 p.m.
[00:46:05.889 --> 00:46:06.329]  with the war room.
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:12.139]  And I'm going to go ahead and get into Putin's statements right now.
[00:46:12.519 --> 00:46:20.480]  And then we're going to come back and play the very disturbing, well, there's a lot of very disturbing clips out of him.
[00:46:20.599 --> 00:46:32.960]  I ended up spending Tuesday and Wednesday about seven, eight hours just on this one subject of Kellogg and Waltz.
[00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.090]  Trump's two advisors on this.
[00:46:36.389 --> 00:46:38.150]  And one of them's saying really good stuff.
[00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.130]  The other one's saying a lot of snaky stuff.
[00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:40.590]  Kellogg.
[00:46:41.889 --> 00:46:43.170]  So we're going to be looking at that.
[00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:48.550]  But just if you're tuned in right now, this broadcast is like high noon to a vampire.
[00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.429]  Okay?
[00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:51.989]  To the globalists.
[00:46:52.469 --> 00:46:54.570]  So just understand, they don't want this on air.
[00:46:55.679 --> 00:46:56.800]  So, what do you do?
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:07.159]  You take the live feed from Real Alex Jones and you hit your whole email list, your text message list, you repost it on your ex or other places, you take clips out, you share it, that's where all the power is, Paul Revere's.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:19.199]  And then you tell those you share it to, to tell those they share it to, to share it, and tell those they share it to, to share it, that causes the chain reaction that we're looking for to win.
[00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:21.760]  And we've already done a lot of chain reactions.
[00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:32.489]  When you watch the congressional attacks on me and the think tank reports, the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundation reports on Infowarsioners truly, going back decades ago, and there's even new ones that are out.
[00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:33.789]  I don't spend time showing you these.
[00:47:33.869 --> 00:47:34.510]  You can look them up if you want.
[00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:36.449]  It's all this guy.
[00:47:40.769 --> 00:47:49.489]  Nine times out of ten is where these narratives come from, and he creates these chain reactions and punches through and forces his talking points out there.
[00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:51.989]  I mean, yeah, you hear Elon Musk now?
[00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:54.130]  Sounds just like me five years ago, ten years ago.
[00:47:54.429 --> 00:47:55.050]  You hear Trump?
[00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:56.369]  Sounds just like me ten years ago.
[00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:59.570]  Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, word for word Alex Jones.
[00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:03.090]  And they listen some, but they don't need to listen.
[00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:10.670]  Once you get the perspective right, understand the master plan, then you start reading the globalists' own admissions and their own operations, and you see it for yourself.
[00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:17.110]  And baby, once you see the matrix for yourself, or once you put the sunglasses on like they live, you don't need me to tell you what I'm seeing.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:22.219]  When Rowdy Piper gets his buddy to put the glasses on finally, he didn't have to say, look, look, see that, see that?
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:23.920]  It's like, oh yeah, see that now?
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:41.800]  So, we are so close to having such a global awakening that I'll still have some use, but I fully intend, it might be a year, it might be five years from now, we really turn the tide big on this,
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:46.619]  once a week podcast, write a book once a year, make a film once a year, do a few interviews, that's it.
[00:48:47.159 --> 00:48:59.599]  I love the crew, we'll still have InfoWars and other talk show hosts on the network, but I mean, and I'm not against doing seven days a week, but I can't do this half speed, so this is all I do.
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:03.099]  All I did, basically for 30 plus years.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.260]  And now it gets more intense.
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:08.139]  You know, as you get older, you know, if you're a workaholic, that's how it is because the work's so important.
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:11.119]  I eat, drink, sleep this.
[00:49:11.239 --> 00:49:12.599]  I dreamed about all this stuff last night.
[00:49:12.659 --> 00:49:14.000]  I was working in my dreams last night.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.760]  And I'm in this dream at about 3 a.m.
[00:49:17.559 --> 00:49:20.099]  And I'm doing work on the New World Order and research.
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.840]  And I went, that's not accurate information.
[00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:24.179]  And I went, oh, I'm in a dream.
[00:49:24.519 --> 00:49:25.159]  Wake up.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:25.920]  And I woke up.
[00:49:26.559 --> 00:49:29.460]  Went and got a drink of water, took a piss, and went back to bed, went back to work.
[00:49:30.119 --> 00:49:33.900]  And my dad had told me about, he was able to do that, read books on dreaming and stuff.
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:37.179]  He'd already done it, some in college, where he could study in his dreams.
[00:49:37.659 --> 00:49:38.599]  And that's what I do now.
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:39.800]  This is all I do.
[00:49:40.739 --> 00:49:47.380]  And it's not that I don't want to work 16, 18 hours a day.
[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:53.840]  It's that I want to have such an awakening and understanding that I'm not needed.
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.400]  Because that means we've done our job.
[00:49:57.579 --> 00:49:59.300]  So the goal is to get to that point.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.659]  Not so I don't have to work all the time.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.460]  It's to get to the goal where I can then step back.
[00:50:04.199 --> 00:50:06.739]  Which is what a real master is able to do.
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.619]  And I want to be a master.
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.159]  There's not really a lot of masters out there.
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.559]  Trump is a master at this point.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:20.840]  Musk is developing into the super badass master of what he does.
[00:50:22.059 --> 00:50:23.619]  And he does so many things.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:24.719]  But...
[00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:30.670]  We really have something special here with the crew and the other talk show hosts and the guests and the information.
[00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:34.230]  We have a wide spectrum understanding of what's really going on.
[00:50:35.369 --> 00:50:42.340]  And I can tell you, you know, I... I get invited to go, you know, speak directly with world leaders.
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.360]  I get invited to go to have dinner with world leaders.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.800]  I'm not going to say the names, but you can probably imagine recently.
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.460]  I mean, I've been invited.
[00:50:50.019 --> 00:50:51.679]  And I just, I just, it's more important.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.159]  I can talk to those people from here.
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.079]  I can talk on air to everybody.
[00:50:55.559 --> 00:50:57.760]  And again, I'm not saying that to sound powerful.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.119]  It's just that I've never put on airs.
[00:51:00.219 --> 00:51:01.699]  This information is what's powerful.
[00:51:03.719 --> 00:51:06.920]  So, I don't try to sit there and go, oh, look, you know, what we're doing is so important.
[00:51:07.179 --> 00:51:10.940]  But then I realize, well, we better let people know that so they understand why it is important to keep it on air.
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:20.219]  I mean, I get on an airplane right now and invited to go meet with all sorts of folks in a very large country that's in a big war.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.960]  And I could go down right now and be invited, you know, repeatedly.
[00:51:24.119 --> 00:51:24.960]  And I'm not insulting him.
[00:51:25.019 --> 00:51:25.880]  I'm very respecting him.
[00:51:26.079 --> 00:51:30.179]  I'd love to go to El Salvador and have dinner and hang out with Hugh Kelly.
[00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:33.969]  And this is like the fifth invite, like, why aren't you coming?
[00:51:34.469 --> 00:51:39.010]  I would love to go when Bolsonaro invited me, and so did his son, down to Brazil when he was president.
[00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:41.989]  I just was like, yeah, I want to go to Brazil, I want to see it, I want to meet you, I want to do it.
[00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:46.150]  I just said, it's too important, I just stay totally focused on the info war when I'm doing it.
[00:51:46.469 --> 00:51:53.809]  And I've had repeated offers to go meet with other world leaders, Putin, and I just don't do it.
[00:51:54.769 --> 00:52:01.989]  My mission is to stay right here in the cockpit, Getting the information out can all be done from right here, more effectively.
[00:52:02.449 --> 00:52:05.429]  But that's why your support is so important.
[00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:06.909]  You keep me in place.
[00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:07.630]  We'll be right back.
[00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:08.110]  Stay with us.
[00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:24.250]  I've got a very simple, but important, powerful, and completely truthful proposal for you.
[00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:26.570]  Keep InfoWars on the air.

[00:56:13.239 --> 00:56:22.179]  Next segment, I'm going to move quickly through them, then I'm going to hit a whole bunch of other critical news, and then later in the four-hour broadcast here today, we're now into hour number two.
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:23.420]  We've got three hours in front of us.
[00:56:23.579 --> 00:56:24.460]  Take your phone calls.
[00:56:24.719 --> 00:56:28.760]  I want to thank everybody for joining us here on this Friday, November 29th, 2024 broadcast.
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:35.519]  But I want to say something about what I was just saying about the importance of InfoWars, the importance of the work we do here.
[00:56:37.699 --> 00:56:43.019]  And the importance of you amplifying what we do and also giving us a lot of intel.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.579]  We are a family.
[00:56:45.579 --> 00:56:47.239]  We are a system.
[00:56:47.519 --> 00:56:57.219]  We are organic human intelligence struggling for truth and justice and freedom and survival and rediscovering our survival instincts.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.260]  So when I explain how important this broadcast is, I'm talking about you.
[00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:07.690]  And not letting the enemy demoralize you or think that you're not strong and that you don't matter.
[00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:08.130]  You do.
[00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:22.170]  And that's really the point that I wanted to make is, of all the other great patriots and authors and filmmakers fighting tyranny, and we all do it together, everybody's incredibly important.
[00:57:24.769 --> 00:57:35.780]  The audience of activists of this broadcast, the men and women in the arena, That make this transmission possible and are part of this resistance movement.
[00:57:36.139 --> 00:57:39.980]  We are at the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart.
[00:57:40.219 --> 00:57:41.619]  We are the core.
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:44.360]  We are recognized as the core.
[00:57:45.699 --> 00:57:47.980]  Now, that's a great responsibility.
[00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:53.860]  And I don't state that, again, from any position of arrogance or pride.
[00:57:54.519 --> 00:57:57.860]  In fact, it's extremely dangerous to be in this position.
[00:57:58.809 --> 00:58:08.070]  But I've more and more realized that even people that are awake to a lot of issues still only operate most of the time on the surface.
[00:58:10.409 --> 00:58:16.349]  And people need to not do that.
[00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:23.190]  And Folks have to realize that everything you do has an effect.
[00:58:23.429 --> 00:58:34.429]  What you buy, what you say, what you do, who you talk to, when you go to a school board meeting, when you take your children out of public schools, or hell, most of the private schools are even worse, getting grant money for all the leftist evil.
[00:58:34.989 --> 00:58:41.130]  That each little move you think's little, each little struggle you go through to do the right thing is not little, damn it.
[00:58:42.130 --> 00:58:47.510]  Everything in the universe is done at a subatomic level that just expands out from that point.
[00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:52.829]  So, and I'm not perfect, believe me, when I say this, I'm lecturing myself.
[00:58:53.389 --> 00:59:03.929]  Eating right, being healthy, being loving, being honorable, taking care of your family, being strong, not being a victim, committing to being a force for justice.
[00:59:04.809 --> 00:59:10.030]  That is the blood and the guts and the sinew and the bones and the brains and the eyes.
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:14.619]  The spirit, the will, it's everything.
[00:59:15.019 --> 00:59:27.519]  So, it is important for all of you to understand, and I want this to burn into your brain, that when you call in thanking me, and saying, I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it, you're the best, you're the best, thank you, I'm trying to do my best.
[00:59:28.119 --> 00:59:39.179]  But all I am is somebody that recognizes a public, evil, anti-human, satanic plan against us, that God warned us about, and that God told us to resist, and I'm just doing the default...
[00:59:40.489 --> 00:59:41.610]  to resist that.
[00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:45.269]  It is insane not to resist it.
[00:59:45.409 --> 00:59:50.389]  So to act like it's heroic to fight tyranny is why we're in this position.
[00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:52.510]  It is like breathing.
[00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:56.650]  You're not heroic when you breathe.
[00:59:56.889 --> 00:59:58.190]  It's not, oh, I've got to breathe.
[00:59:58.210 --> 00:59:58.969]  It's so much work.
[00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:00.010]  It's what you do.
[01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:10.900]  And standing up for what's right and standing up for your own individual freedom and those around you's freedoms is not Exceptional.
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:14.760]  Now, it's become exceptional, and that's why we're in so much trouble.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:28.940]  So, what is exceptional is out of all the shows and all the organizations and all the groups out there that are fan bases and niches and political movements, it's almost all disinformation, crap, or delusions.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:39.000]  This broadcast is hated by the tyrants because it's as close in our flawed temporal understanding of reality to reality as you're going to get.
[01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:43.579]  This is as close to the truth as you're going to get as being a flawed human.
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:45.039]  And I don't just mean me.
[01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:46.800]  I mean the guest, you, all of us.
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:47.679]  We're it.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.800]  We're recognized as the best there is.
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:50.860]  So recognize yourself.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:56.579]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:01:00.079 --> 01:01:02.579]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide.
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.579]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:01:06.039 --> 01:01:31.210]  It is Friday, November 29, 2024. 51 days, 22 hours, 53 minutes, 30 seconds to the inauguration of Donald John Trump winning his third in a row presidential election going up against the satanic pedophile Megalomaniac,
[01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:36.630]  worst collection of trash the planet has ever witnessed.
[01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:40.349]  That victory is yours.
[01:01:40.889 --> 01:01:42.190]  You did that.
[01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:55.130]  And I keep saying that because the general public needs to know the truth that you bring the change.
[01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:57.989]  You bring the power.
[01:01:59.159 --> 01:02:00.659]  The world's listening to you.
[01:02:01.039 --> 01:02:02.480]  They're listening to me.
[01:02:03.099 --> 01:02:05.760]  We're promoting the truth and sanity and justice.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.639]  We have the track record of accuracy.
[01:02:08.119 --> 01:02:09.780]  That's why they want us off the air.
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:16.000]  Because in this black night of fraud, the light that is there shines so much brighter.
[01:02:18.079 --> 01:02:27.440]  And in this storm, at sea, as the ships come into the channel, if that lighthouse isn't there, they're going to careen right into it.
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:33.840]  Pylons of rocks and sink and be crushed against the shore.
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:35.820]  All right.
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:37.639]  Briefly recapping.
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.079]  Had a lot of people join us minute to minute.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:41.300]  Trump has made good.
[01:02:41.579 --> 01:02:42.099]  It's confirmed.
[01:02:43.579 --> 01:02:56.079]  He is telling Zelensky that he'll have his money and military aid cut if Zelensky doesn't start moving now towards a ceasefire.
[01:02:58.210 --> 01:03:12.590]  And that once Trump gets into office in 51 days, they can immediately move to demilitarize Ukraine and bring in Western forces, but not offensive weapons.
[01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:14.289]  This is being proposed by Trump.
[01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:23.289]  Russia will be given a little less than a third of Ukraine in the east as a military buffer zone that Putin said he wanted when he invaded a few years ago.
[01:03:24.869 --> 01:03:30.849]  Russia would keep Crimea, that's always been part of Russia, and their Black Sea port.
[01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:42.349]  And the Ukraine would agree to never join NATO. So, that's where we are.
[01:03:45.610 --> 01:04:16.139]  The globalist neocons and leftists and the NATO operatives Have said that they want to continue to escalate the situation in hoping that Russia will overreact and that'll be a pretext to expand the war and officially have Ukraine join NATO. They might even entice or provocate Russia into a nuclear response
[01:04:16.139 --> 01:04:18.559]  and the globalists would rather have a nuclear war.
[01:04:18.739 --> 01:04:23.920]  They believe they can come out on top after all of that unspeakable Armageddon-like carnage.
[01:04:26.619 --> 01:04:38.800]  And there are a lot of smart people in government and corporations and around the world as well as here that say, we don't want to end the war.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.599]  I mean, we don't want to end the world.
[01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:48.110]  There's got to be a way to stop this.
[01:04:48.250 --> 01:05:01.250]  But then again, there are the globalists that know their system is coming to an end and they want to use the war as the pretext and the detonator to create a global crisis so big that on the ashes of it, they can stay in power.
[01:05:03.989 --> 01:05:05.610]  So that's where we are.
[01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:11.090]  Vladimir Putin came out yesterday and said a lot of very interesting things.
[01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:20.670]  He said Trump, he believes, is still in serious danger and hopes that he's taking precautions, should be taking precautions.
[01:05:21.929 --> 01:05:26.150]  He said that he understands that Trump is smart and the war is completely out of control.
[01:05:27.309 --> 01:05:33.150]  He went on to say that they're not going to accept ever Ukraine having nuclear weapons.
[01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:37.590]  He said that Ukraine doesn't have nuclear weapons.
[01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:59.110]  And that if they do have nuclear weapons, they would have had to be given to them by a NATO country, and that that violates the international treaties on WMD proliferation, and that Russia will respond with nuclear weapons.
[01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:01.989]  And Medvedev, that is basically...
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:07.559]  Putin's mouthpiece that plays the bad cop.
[01:06:07.699 --> 01:06:08.559]  Putin plays the good cop.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.920]  He said transfer.
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.280]  Put that back on screen, please.
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:13.199]  Transfer of nuclear weapons.
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:18.699]  Transfer of U.S. nukes to Ukraine would be seen as a nuclear attack on Russia.
[01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:20.539]  And yet you have says.
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:32.860]  And again, you've got the former head of MI6. You've got Vladimir Putin now yesterday saying a state of war between Russia and NATO is now in place.
[01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:36.230]  Which wasn't a hard prediction for me to make last week.
[01:06:42.369 --> 01:06:46.409]  I said last Wednesday that within a week I would expect Putin to announce that.
[01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:47.550]  And I was wrong.
[01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:51.769]  He announced it in eight days, not in seven.
[01:06:53.889 --> 01:06:59.420]  So, We have other important articles here.
[01:07:00.179 --> 01:07:05.059]  Newsweek, Russia and China staged nuclear bomber exercise near U.S. allies.
[01:07:05.239 --> 01:07:06.320]  We'll get to more of that in a moment.
[01:07:08.719 --> 01:07:09.940]  World War III update.
[01:07:10.119 --> 01:07:12.500]  Former MI6 head says NATO now at war with Russia.
[01:07:13.099 --> 01:07:15.679]  Putin readies Satan 2 nukes in response.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:25.340]  But let's go to a clip of Vladimir Putin slams the U.S. government for treating Donald Trump unfairly.
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:25.820]  Here it is.
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:42.000]  Well, probably just like me, you are amazed not by the fact that absolutely uncivilized means had been used against Trump all the way up to assassination attempts,
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:44.019]  numerous assassination attempts.
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:47.079]  And I think he's not safe even now.
[01:07:50.699 --> 01:08:02.650]  The history of the United States has known many But I think President Trump is a smart person and a cautious one, I hope.
[01:08:03.769 --> 01:08:20.539]  But what amazed me most, that in fighting him, not only Trump was subjected to humiliating court procedures, accusations and so on,
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.479]  but his family was attacked as well.
[01:08:23.619 --> 01:08:24.939]  His children were attacked.
[01:08:25.739 --> 01:08:27.779]  Gangsters don't do this in Russia.
[01:08:29.239 --> 01:08:33.979]  When criminal gangs fight, they don't touch children and women.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:37.880]  It's men who fight among themselves.
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:42.039]  But those guys stooped as low as that.
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:45.020]  I think this is so...
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:57.739]  This looks so bad that it only preaffirms, reconfirms how low the political system of the United States has fallen.
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:09.039]  And if you look at global numbers around the world, over 90% of the world sees the West as the aggressor here because the West did start this proxy war 14 years ago and has been doing it the whole time.
[01:09:10.119 --> 01:09:17.140]  Again, different globalists like Soros gone on TV and bragged about it.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:20.000]  I mean, Victoria Newland admits it.
[01:09:20.899 --> 01:09:22.659]  Putin's like, you got bioweapon labs there.
[01:09:22.779 --> 01:09:23.159]  Stop it.
[01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:24.340]  She goes before Congress.
[01:09:24.439 --> 01:09:25.079]  She goes, yeah, we do.
[01:09:25.239 --> 01:09:25.760]  So what?
[01:09:27.649 --> 01:09:35.010]  It isn't Russia that cooked up the poison shots, and it didn't Russia cook that crap up at Wuhan, and that was not even the Chinese.
[01:09:35.289 --> 01:09:36.550]  By the way, I'd blame them in a second.
[01:09:36.649 --> 01:09:37.210]  They were behind it.
[01:09:37.289 --> 01:09:37.890]  It wasn't them.
[01:09:37.989 --> 01:09:38.869]  It's come out the Pentagon did it.
[01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:50.750]  They got caught under Obama cooking that crap up in 2013-14 at UT... Galveston, Rice University, Houston, and the main place was Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:51.670]  Big controversy.
[01:09:51.949 --> 01:09:58.630]  So they moved their airborne SARS, COVID-19, to damn Wuhan so they could have their plausible deniability ready.
[01:09:59.789 --> 01:10:05.850]  And then Fauci went on C-SPAN and stuff a year before and said, don't worry, something really bad's about to happen.
[01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:08.289]  There'll be a new virus out of China.
[01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:09.770]  We'll take over using it.
[01:10:10.069 --> 01:10:11.270]  It's going to be great.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:16.800]  I mean, this has all come out.
[01:10:17.699 --> 01:10:21.760]  So, Russia's got its issues.
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.619]  I'm not saying Russia is our sweetheart.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:39.779]  What I'm saying is the new world order are the ones trafficking kids here and dissolving the border and defunding the police and destroying the dollar and shipping hundreds of billions of dollars to Ukraine and all the arrests and cutting off our energy and geoengineering.
[01:10:41.479 --> 01:10:43.300]  Big geoengineering news coming up, by the way.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:44.260]  I've got to cover this.
[01:10:45.239 --> 01:10:46.800]  But let's go to another Putin clip.
[01:10:46.979 --> 01:10:47.699]  Here's Putin.
[01:10:49.699 --> 01:10:52.119]  Won't allow West to arm Ukraine with nukes.
[01:10:52.239 --> 01:10:52.619]  Here it is.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:11:02.000]  What do you think if we speak about the common sense, if we are involved in the hostilities with the country that is becoming a nuclear power?
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:03.460]  If that's the case...
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:11.539]  We will use every, I would like to emphasize this, every means every weapon at our disposal.
[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:14.920]  We will not let this happen, that's one.
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:26.729]  Two, such statements can only be done by people who are irresponsible, We're not responsible for anything and they carry no burden of responsibility on their shoulders.
[01:11:27.029 --> 01:11:31.350]  Responsibility neither for their country nor for the world in general.
[01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:45.869]  Three, if someone is giving something officially, then it means that it is going to be a violation of all the obligations assumed under the non-proliferation of the mass destruction weapons treaties.
[01:11:46.489 --> 01:11:48.470]  As for Ukraine itself?
[01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:54.670]  We will follow every step of theirs.
[01:11:56.449 --> 01:12:05.010]  It used to be a highly developed industrial republic within the Soviet Union, but they've lost everything, or almost lost everything.
[01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:09.569]  Everything that the Soviet Ukraine was proud of, used to be proud of.
[01:12:09.770 --> 01:12:13.970]  So today, to make something from scratch would be next to impossible.
[01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:18.550]  Only some kind of dirty bomb, as they put it.
[01:12:19.079 --> 01:12:28.199]  Using the waste fuel from the nuclear power plants, but we will respond in kind at the Russian Federation.
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:38.859]  Now breaking, Zelensky suggests he's prepared to end Ukraine war and return for NATO membership even if Russia doesn't immediately return seized land.
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:50.159]  So, Trump says, demilitarize zone, put U.S. troops in, but they don't join NATO, and Russia gets part of Ukraine.
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:54.100]  And now we hear from Zelensky now he wants the NATO membership.
[01:12:56.239 --> 01:12:58.880]  And that was what Putin said on the eve of an invasion.
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:08.779]  Almost three years ago, he said, look, they're going to join NATO, and the way the lay of the land works is they can roll right in if they're right on our border there.
[01:13:08.859 --> 01:13:11.359]  We need to take this area all along these rivers.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.899]  We've got topography where we can build it up.
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:21.020]  So we need to go ahead and just take that so that if NATO does take over, we can defend ourselves.
[01:13:21.479 --> 01:13:24.680]  Because he's got to have a land corridor also down to Crimea in the south.
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:27.920]  I mean, he told everybody, and now it's happening.
[01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:40.130]  So, Putin has been completely transparent about what was happening and why he did this.
[01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:41.430]  He's like, we don't want Ukraine.
[01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:42.329]  We got too much land.
[01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:45.489]  But you just keep coming up to our borders and putting weapons in.
[01:13:46.810 --> 01:13:49.670]  And we're not going to let you get right up to the Russian border with this crap.
[01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:52.010]  You already surround us all over the place.
[01:13:53.409 --> 01:13:58.329]  I mean, that's the corridors right where the Nazis invaded in 1942 in the winter.
[01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:07.970]  Without going into all the topography and things, the lay of the land and the other areas around there is not good.
[01:14:08.489 --> 01:14:09.489]  Mountains, you name it.
[01:14:09.710 --> 01:14:10.810]  But right there, just roll.
[01:14:10.890 --> 01:14:13.010]  It's like flat, like the plains of Texas.
[01:14:13.489 --> 01:14:14.149]  Right in there.
[01:14:14.689 --> 01:14:15.409]  That's the spot.
[01:14:15.489 --> 01:14:16.729]  And they're like, nope, not doing that.
[01:14:17.689 --> 01:14:18.289]  Stop it.
[01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.989]  Stop it.
[01:14:19.170 --> 01:14:19.550]  Stop it.
[01:14:19.649 --> 01:14:20.529]  Stop bringing troops in.
[01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:21.289]  Stop giving them weapons.
[01:14:21.449 --> 01:14:22.289]  Okay, we're going to invade.
[01:14:22.489 --> 01:14:23.449]  All right, we've invaded.
[01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:29.069]  The United States would have done that way before if somebody got on our border with that crap.
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:33.039]  So again, we are not in the position as the good guys.
[01:14:34.079 --> 01:14:35.579]  I don't need to explain to everybody.
[01:14:35.859 --> 01:14:36.800]  You already know I'm right.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.260]  Do we have bad people running our government?
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.079]  Are they trying to hurt us?
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:43.399]  Are they out of control?
[01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:50.079]  Are they going to popular YouTube people's houses in New York that have a pet squirrel that's super popular and killing it?
[01:14:51.119 --> 01:14:57.380]  Yeah, little kids are getting smuggled by the government across the border for slave labor and sex slavery, but don't worry, we got plenty of money to SWAT team you over a squirrel.
[01:14:58.909 --> 01:15:00.510]  Does that sound like good guys or bad guys?
[01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:02.970]  These are megalomaniacs out of control.
[01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:07.569]  That literally...
[01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:13.090]  Almost every public school is teaching little boys they're really girls.
[01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:18.390]  And almost every private school that's got any real funding is doing it too.
[01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:19.930]  I mean, this is a cult, people.
[01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:21.750]  They're bad guys.
[01:15:22.569 --> 01:15:25.289]  And I know the audience knows that, but for new listeners, I just want to explain.
[01:15:25.689 --> 01:15:29.130]  If you support the left and what they're doing, you are in a cult.
[01:15:29.489 --> 01:15:30.890]  The globalists don't like you.
[01:15:30.989 --> 01:15:31.750]  They want you dead.
[01:15:35.210 --> 01:15:37.409]  They are depopulationists.
[01:15:37.489 --> 01:15:38.329]  They are exterminists.
[01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:39.310]  They are a death cult.
[01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:41.810]  All right, let me get to this big clip now.
[01:15:43.090 --> 01:15:47.210]  This is General Kellogg, Keith Kellogg.
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:52.159]  This is Trump's head peace envoy in all of this.
[01:15:53.619 --> 01:16:10.720]  And we've heard his new national security advisor, Waltz, say we need to de-escalate, we need to make a deal, we need to cut the weapons off, we need to have them come to the table, this is out of control, Biden needs to stop bombing Russia, the threat escalation ladder is too dangerous,
[01:16:11.439 --> 01:16:26.579]  this leads to total war, and then you've got Kellogg, there's a bunch of these clips, making the rounds on Fox in the last few days, going, well, I don't know any of this, so it's just my opinion, but, you know, Trump might be behind telling Biden,
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.460]  go ahead and bomb them with missiles, so he's got a negotiating point.
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.920]  No, that's what the neocons and the globalists want.
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:39.159]  And Kellogg's like, I always thought we should be bombing Russia.
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:46.729]  And then We learn the next day that no, Trump is trying to get a peace deal.
[01:16:49.050 --> 01:16:54.449]  But notice Kellogg also says in the club, we'll play it here in a moment, that, oh, this place is a tinderbox.
[01:16:54.569 --> 01:16:55.369]  They can't explode at any time.
[01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:56.010]  It's so dangerous.
[01:16:56.010 --> 01:16:57.130]  We need to de-escalate.
[01:16:57.529 --> 01:17:09.050]  But then the answer is, bomb Russia with nuclear-capable missiles, which is already going on, and have NATO officially Tuesday, like, oh, maybe we should sneak attack Russia.
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.699]  NATO. Our policy has been to use Ukraine as a proxy.
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:24.279]  You know, we're not dying and the Ukrainians are dying and it's weakening Russia.
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:24.859]  This is great.
[01:17:25.079 --> 01:17:26.199]  You've heard that from Lindsey Graham.
[01:17:26.319 --> 01:17:27.000]  You've heard it from all of them.
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:28.500]  What an immoral statement.
[01:17:28.699 --> 01:17:30.039]  And then now it's like, oh, yeah.
[01:17:33.819 --> 01:17:35.399]  You know, we just start bombing Russia.
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:36.939]  That'll really make them be nice.
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:40.239]  Which is what Russia said.
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:45.840]  You're going to move these missiles up to our border and start bombing us, and then you can use them as a sneak attack if we accept conventional ones hitting us.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:50.680]  How do we know you don't then switch them out for hydrogen bombs and you take out our forces in a sneak attack?
[01:17:50.979 --> 01:17:52.739]  And he goes, yeah, that's actually what we're planning.
[01:18:05.779 --> 01:18:13.970]  That reminds me of the scene in Peril Rider where the Big mining company doesn't like the claim squatters that have their own claims.
[01:18:14.109 --> 01:18:15.130]  They want to strip mine it.
[01:18:16.989 --> 01:18:23.409]  And the company brings in a bunch of these hired guns to start killing people, but they got to trick them.
[01:18:24.029 --> 01:18:31.989]  So they start smart-mouthing the old miner in front of his family and making him feel bad about himself.
[01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:36.590]  And then they trick him and they kill him.
[01:18:38.789 --> 01:18:45.130]  I mean, you know, somebody walks up to you on the street, slaps you in the face, and tries to get you to make a move against them.
[01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:49.550]  If you're smart, you sit back and you go, why is this guy trying to get me to make a move?
[01:18:49.649 --> 01:18:52.510]  Why is this guy trying to put me in a provocation?
[01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:53.689]  What's the setup?
[01:18:55.590 --> 01:19:02.810]  It happens to me, not often now, but when Trump first got elected and then over his first administration, it probably happened, let's not exaggerate.
[01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:06.310]  Fifteen times or more?
[01:19:08.239 --> 01:19:09.420]  I start trying to think how many times.
[01:19:09.579 --> 01:19:10.420]  It'd probably be like 20-something.
[01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:15.239]  But I'd be sitting there in a restaurant, tap on the shoulder, turn around.
[01:19:15.399 --> 01:19:15.880]  Hey, what's up?
[01:19:16.399 --> 01:19:17.300]  You know, I hope you die.
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:23.000]  I just hate you, you Nazi piece of crap, you Russian agent, you piece of filth.
[01:19:23.399 --> 01:19:27.100]  And I'd be like, don't touch me and leave me alone.
[01:19:29.949 --> 01:19:33.369]  And then I'd call over the waiter, and I'd say, get me your manager.
[01:19:33.930 --> 01:19:38.329]  And I'd say, a guy just came up, tapped on me, and he went around the corner.
[01:19:38.770 --> 01:19:40.109]  I think he's going to come back.
[01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:41.529]  I want you to go stand over there and watch.
[01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:46.989]  Because I figured this out if it happened a few times, and it turned out it was local Antifa did this at least three or four times in Austin.
[01:19:47.289 --> 01:19:48.310]  They'd know I was at a restaurant.
[01:19:48.449 --> 01:19:50.829]  One of their people would call, then they'd come to the restaurant and do it.
[01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:54.529]  So later, I saw Owen at events, and I saw these same people there.
[01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:56.390]  They were with Antifa.
[01:19:56.449 --> 01:19:57.189]  They weren't wearing masks.
[01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:06.050]  Famous case of this, it hit the news, happened at Lucy's Fried Chicken on South Congress.
[01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:09.010]  It's kind of outside an indoor area.
[01:20:09.210 --> 01:20:10.350]  This is one of the first times it happened.
[01:20:10.449 --> 01:20:11.350]  I started figuring out how it worked.
[01:20:11.810 --> 01:20:14.850]  And then he came over a couple more times and did it, and the manager told him to go away.
[01:20:14.869 --> 01:20:20.489]  The next time, he went outside and waited, and they got a picnic table right by the exit.
[01:20:21.989 --> 01:20:27.010]  And when I came out, they were like, F you, Alex Jones, F you.
[01:20:27.170 --> 01:20:28.069]  And then...
[01:20:29.979 --> 01:20:33.659]  They had their phones going, so it looked like I came over to be mean to them.
[01:20:33.739 --> 01:20:36.539]  It was like, Alex Jones screams innocent people at Lucy's Chicken.
[01:20:36.899 --> 01:20:41.739]  They even sent the Austin-American statesman down because they thought they had me.
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:46.500]  And the statesman rider had to be fair and goes, well, we talked to the manager.
[01:20:46.619 --> 01:20:48.159]  They'd actually been over to his table three times.
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:50.140]  So I've had them do that.
[01:20:50.239 --> 01:20:51.680]  Oh, I've had them do it in Seattle.
[01:20:51.859 --> 01:20:53.920]  I've had them do it in any leftist area.
[01:20:54.319 --> 01:20:55.479]  Happened in San Francisco.
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:58.680]  Happened in Austin five, six times at least.
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.619]  And then you learn, but that's what they do.
[01:21:01.819 --> 01:21:12.899]  They provocate you, they get in your face, and then they got their camera rolling, then they edit it out, like, oh, this crazy guy just came over and yelled at me.
[01:21:13.359 --> 01:21:21.460]  You know, because this was three times he came over and said, I hope you die, F your family, stuff like that.
[01:21:23.319 --> 01:21:27.579]  Only touched me once, and then they're waiting when I come out the door the next time.
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:31.220]  Again, to do their theater, to be the victims.
[01:21:34.899 --> 01:21:36.760]  So, that's what they do.
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:41.539]  And so they're doing this on a trillion times the scale with Russia.
[01:21:43.739 --> 01:21:45.960]  Except they're doing it with bombs they drop on them.
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:50.600]  Alright, I promise I'll get to Kellogg and a few more clips and I'm going to move on to the other stuff.
[01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.140]  It's hard to get off this subject.
[01:21:52.279 --> 01:21:53.939]  There's some other things I want to hit.
[01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:54.579]  We're going to go to break.

[01:23:28.079 --> 01:23:28.880]  Thank you so much.
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:29.359]  We'll be right back.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:37.279]  Well, the winner, Chris Delaro, is here in studio from New Jersey, former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[01:23:37.279 --> 01:23:38.399]  What an amazing aircraft.
[01:23:38.739 --> 01:23:43.819]  This is one of the pinnacles in my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there, just being in this studio.
[01:23:43.819 --> 01:23:44.979]  I never imagined I'd be.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:45.960]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[01:23:46.039 --> 01:23:46.640]  You're the reason we're here.
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:50.220]  I can't wait to learn who the next winner is.
[01:23:50.319 --> 01:23:52.800]  And even though they shut out InfoWars, the Alex Jones Network continues on.
[01:23:53.359 --> 01:23:59.159]  TheAlexJonesTour.com is not owned by me, so we now know it's the Democratic Party and the biggest gun control group that was behind all the fake lawsuits.
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:01.239]  We already knew that, but now they've bragged about it.
[01:24:01.399 --> 01:24:06.479]  Whether these people are successful or not, and I believe they won't be, we're going to continue on at the Alex Jones Network.
[01:24:06.699 --> 01:24:10.600]  And so, this baby is the new promotion, and I will be...
[01:24:11.010 --> 01:24:18.890]  Delivering this bad boy and $10,000 cash to you, from myself and the entire Infowars family and the Alex Shows Network family.
[01:24:19.069 --> 01:24:20.510]  You are our family.
[01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:21.949]  God bless you all.
[01:24:22.109 --> 01:24:25.189]  Now go to thealexshowstore.com and get entered to win this bad boy.
[01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:27.050]  Please stand by for further details.
[01:24:27.250 --> 01:24:29.409]  We return you now to your regularly scheduled program.
[01:24:29.609 --> 01:24:32.010]  Alright, so Wednesday I see...
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:50.939]  General Keith Kellogg that's been friends with Trump for decades and was in his last administration, and I don't want to say he's a bad guy, but we have all the clips in the last two and a half years calling for full war with Russia, bombing Russia, all of it, and then he goes on Fox News and says,
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:52.239]  well, you're about to see it.
[01:24:53.079 --> 01:24:55.739]  Oh, it's a tinderbox, oh, it's so dangerous, oh, you know, but...
[01:24:56.770 --> 01:24:58.569]  I've been for bombing Russia the whole time.
[01:24:58.949 --> 01:25:04.010]  You don't, you know, fight a war and then, you know, let the enemy have safe zones.
[01:25:04.649 --> 01:25:08.350]  So if Vietnam would have attacked us in the Vietnam War, that would have been okay?
[01:25:09.850 --> 01:25:13.369]  Or we were fighting North Korea in the Korean War, would it be okay if they attacked us?
[01:25:13.810 --> 01:25:15.210]  This is a proxy war.
[01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:22.649]  So the idea, so if the U.S. is supplying Ukraine, Russia could say, well, then we're going to attack you.
[01:25:23.739 --> 01:25:26.239]  I mean, it's just, it's just, it's no, he's like, oh, it's no big deal.
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:27.319]  It's good to bomb Russia.
[01:25:29.359 --> 01:25:33.979]  Almost all the even mainline military analysts have told Biden don't do this, but now he's doing it.
[01:25:34.479 --> 01:25:36.199]  Everybody knows how dangerous this is.
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:38.439]  He says it's super dangerous.
[01:25:39.819 --> 01:25:47.380]  And then he implies that, well, I don't know this, but I tell you, Trump could have told Biden to do this as a negotiating point.
[01:25:47.539 --> 01:25:49.899]  That way Trump can move backwards or sideways, whatever.
[01:25:50.239 --> 01:25:51.520]  That's not how Trump operates.
[01:25:51.739 --> 01:25:55.949]  So, I believe he was saying this out of class.
[01:25:56.250 --> 01:25:58.069]  I believe he was saying this unauthorized.
[01:25:58.710 --> 01:26:02.170]  We've seen a lot of this with Trump's last administration and ongoing.
[01:26:03.710 --> 01:26:06.510]  And these guys don't think Trump's watching all the time.
[01:26:07.289 --> 01:26:09.689]  But since then, we've seen no Trump wants a peace deal.
[01:26:09.789 --> 01:26:10.949]  No, he wants to cut the funds off.
[01:26:11.050 --> 01:26:12.229]  No, he wants to get it done now.
[01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:23.210]  I'm confident Trump will do the right thing because he's been anti-World War III forever.
[01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:25.310]  He understands what's going on.
[01:26:25.630 --> 01:26:27.430]  And Trump does what he says he's going to do.
[01:26:27.989 --> 01:26:43.949]  But this still gives you the idea into the mind Of the Republicans and Democrats in the establishment who think it's manly and tough to want to go to war with Russia and that are trying to get us into full war thinking we're politically, geopolitically,
[01:26:44.189 --> 01:26:47.550]  militarily illiterate.
[01:26:48.449 --> 01:26:49.489]  So, no.
[01:26:50.770 --> 01:27:00.550]  The West in the last 14 years starting this proxy war ongoing, escalating to where we are now, saying the Russians are bluffing, That they're going to respond.
[01:27:00.689 --> 01:27:03.350]  They stopped bluffing in February three years ago.
[01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:06.989]  Hell, they did that before that with the invasion of Crimea.
[01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.930]  They're done.
[01:27:08.670 --> 01:27:12.829]  So, you can't keep escalating this unless you want to go to full war with the Russians.
[01:27:12.970 --> 01:27:18.390]  And the Russians, Putin said yesterday, that's another clip, you pull up the headline, Putin says Russia now war with the West.
[01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:20.550]  Kind of a big deal.
[01:27:21.390 --> 01:27:24.090]  So, okay, do the American people want this war?
[01:27:24.250 --> 01:27:25.729]  Nope, 80 plus percent are against it.
[01:27:28.099 --> 01:27:29.859]  So we don't want it.
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:30.680]  We elected Trump.
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:31.800]  He said he would stop it.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:46.819]  He didn't get elected to expand World War III. So Keith Kellogg Jr., the so-called peace envoy, needs to be watched very closely.
[01:27:48.199 --> 01:27:49.000]  Here's the clip.
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.279]  Well, good to be back.
[01:27:51.539 --> 01:27:55.500]  So Ukraine's ex-top general says World War III has begun.
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:59.899]  I'm sure that he would like the world to believe that so that the allies throw in with Ukraine.
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:01.399]  But do you really see it that way?
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:05.000]  No, I don't think World War III has begun, but we're right on the precipice.
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:06.079]  I mean, it's right there.
[01:28:06.199 --> 01:28:11.750]  And what I mean by that is when you look at what's happening, look at With an alliance, President Trump kept apart.
[01:28:11.909 --> 01:28:16.149]  He had North Korea over here, he had China over here, he had Iran here, and he had Russia over here.
[01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:18.149]  And what you've seen them now is they've all joined.
[01:28:18.250 --> 01:28:21.510]  You've got an axis together, and they're feeding off one another.
[01:28:22.289 --> 01:28:26.909]  Just in June, Russia signed a self-defense pact with North Koreans.
[01:28:27.210 --> 01:28:28.729]  So now for the first time- Wait, stop this.
[01:28:28.909 --> 01:28:29.890]  I'm gonna start and stop it.
[01:28:30.829 --> 01:28:31.829]  Go to the first again.
[01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:37.829]  NATO started the war 14 years ago.
[01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:47.010]  Trump did not do the, because he got intimidated or froze out, not even intimidated by all the impeachments and the Russiagate.
[01:28:47.050 --> 01:28:49.390]  And if he got involved in Ukraine, oh, he's a Russian agent.
[01:28:49.649 --> 01:28:51.670]  So Trump didn't end the war.
[01:28:51.829 --> 01:28:54.069]  It didn't expand massively under him.
[01:28:54.130 --> 01:29:04.210]  So that was a win, a B+. But what's driven Russia and China and everybody together is NATO moving up to the border.
[01:29:04.409 --> 01:29:06.489]  Of course that's going to create these alliances.
[01:29:06.710 --> 01:29:08.170]  Of course that's bad for America.
[01:29:08.409 --> 01:29:09.829]  Look at the BRICS getting stronger.
[01:29:10.029 --> 01:29:21.010]  So their policies that Kellogg has supported have led to this, and then he wants to just act like this happened in a vacuum and blame Biden, who's just as much to blame as anybody.
[01:29:21.170 --> 01:29:22.270]  But I mean, it's just...
[01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:25.590]  The West is starting a war with Russia.
[01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:27.369]  The West is encircling Russia.
[01:29:28.949 --> 01:29:30.569]  Blew up Serbia in the mid-90s.
[01:29:30.670 --> 01:29:31.909]  It's just gone on from there.
[01:29:32.869 --> 01:29:34.550]  And Russia is tired of it.
[01:29:34.810 --> 01:29:36.069]  We are not in the right.
[01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:37.250]  This is wrong.
[01:29:38.170 --> 01:29:41.289]  Now just listen to this crap and listen to the contradictions.
[01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:42.069]  Start it over.
[01:29:44.170 --> 01:29:47.550]  So, Ukraine's ex-top general says World War III has begun.
[01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:53.449]  I'm sure that he would like the world to believe that so that the allies throw in with Ukraine, but do you really see it that way?
[01:29:53.869 --> 01:29:57.029]  No, I don't think World War III has begun, but we're right on the precipice.
[01:29:57.109 --> 01:29:58.149]  I mean, it's right there.
[01:29:58.149 --> 01:30:08.199]  And what I mean by that is when you look at what's happening, look at What President Trump kept apart, you know, he had North Korea over here, he had China over here, he had Iran here, and he had Russia over here.
[01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:10.199]  And what you've seen them now is they've all joined.
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:13.560]  You've got an axis together, and they're feeding off one another.
[01:30:13.739 --> 01:30:18.960]  You know, just in June, Russia signed a self-defense pact with North Koreans.
[01:30:19.159 --> 01:30:23.800]  So now for the first time in its history, North Korea has exported fighters into Russia.
[01:30:24.319 --> 01:30:27.640]  Between 10,000 to 30,000 North Koreans are now fighting.
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:35.970]  You're seeing a use of an Intermediate range ballistic missile that can be nuclear tipped, being shot at Dnipro, a city of around 900,000.
[01:30:36.189 --> 01:30:38.189]  So you're seeing this thing starting to build.
[01:30:38.289 --> 01:30:49.369]  And that, I think, internationally is going to be President Trump's biggest thing he's going to have to solve, which is the fight theory in Ukraine and Russia, which happens to be the largest land war in Europe since the end of the world.
[01:30:49.789 --> 01:30:51.029]  So it's massive.
[01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:53.149]  And John, you know this.
[01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:58.840]  A simple spark can spin things right out of control and without even trying out there.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.739]  You assassinate one archduke and suddenly...
[01:31:01.739 --> 01:31:02.000]  Yep.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:03.220]  Absolutely.
[01:31:03.979 --> 01:31:04.539]  Good touche.
[01:31:05.979 --> 01:31:12.399]  General, talk to us about this new sort of sophisticated weapon that Putin is now...
[01:31:12.399 --> 01:31:13.699]  He launched some kind of...
[01:31:14.890 --> 01:31:18.550]  Medium-range ballistic missiles with a lot of warheads on it into Ukraine.
[01:31:19.010 --> 01:31:23.470]  Can you talk to us in layman's terms what it does and how alarmed people should be about it?
[01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:30.310]  It's an intermediate-range ballistic missile based off range, and it's got MIRVs on it, multiple independent reentry vehicles, so more than one warhead.
[01:31:30.579 --> 01:31:33.500]  Meaning they can split up and hit a whole lot of targets.
[01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:35.239]  Yes, they will break off and hit multiple targets.
[01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:38.319]  And again, it can be nuclear-tipped.
[01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:40.000]  But they only used one.
[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:48.500]  And it's basically a class of what they call truck-mounted intermedia range ballistic missiles that they've got there.
[01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:51.260]  He's used it for psychological reasons.
[01:31:51.319 --> 01:31:52.979]  And Jack Keane made a great comment on that.
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:58.539]  He didn't use it because it was militarily effective, because it hit a city Not very much damage there at all.
[01:31:58.779 --> 01:32:01.319]  But he's kind of saying to the West, well, see what I can do.
[01:32:01.539 --> 01:32:03.399]  And this is one where people have backed off.
[01:32:03.619 --> 01:32:04.680]  President Biden's backed off.
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:09.760]  When the minute he said IRBM, ICBM, nuclear war, we said, oh my gosh, we can't go there.
[01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:13.079]  That's when you need to lean in, because he is not he-meaning Putin.
[01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:15.039]  He will not start a nuclear war in Europe.
[01:32:15.039 --> 01:32:17.359]  And he'd remind them, let me make sure you understand.
[01:32:18.050 --> 01:32:19.189]  The Brits have nuclear weapons.
[01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:20.189]  The French have nuclear weapons.
[01:32:20.289 --> 01:32:21.109]  We've got nuclear weapons.
[01:32:21.250 --> 01:32:21.810]  Don't go there.
[01:32:22.529 --> 01:32:24.149]  And we haven't really said that to him.
[01:32:24.210 --> 01:32:25.869]  So it's kind of a psychological play.
[01:32:25.989 --> 01:32:27.390]  And I think Jack Keane's got it right.
[01:32:27.569 --> 01:32:35.770]  So he's kind of upped the ante in weaponry, just like Zelensky upped the ante when he went into the Kursk region with the long-range missiles.
[01:32:35.770 --> 01:32:43.270]  He attacked them in So everybody's wondering why Biden suddenly gave permission to Ukraine to launch these attackers deeper into Russian territory.
[01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:48.069]  Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about that yesterday at the briefing and gave a typical answer.
[01:32:48.170 --> 01:32:48.510]  Listen here.
[01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:57.449]  For a long time, the White House argued that using these long-range attacking missiles into Russia to attack targets inside Russia would escalate.
[01:32:57.649 --> 01:33:01.149]  The war would really invite retaliation.
[01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:02.430]  Why change the policy now?
[01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:06.090]  I'm just not going to get into specifics about Ukraine's operations.
[01:33:06.090 --> 01:33:07.770]  That's something that I'm going to do today.
[01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:09.250]  But I want to be really clear.
[01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:12.489]  I guess I'm asking about the specifics of the White House decision to change policy.
[01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:15.970]  I'm just telling you that I'm not going to get into specifics from here, from the podium.
[01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:19.649]  Yeah, so that's what we've kind of gotten used to, saying nothing about everything.
[01:33:20.130 --> 01:33:21.310]  But why now?
[01:33:21.649 --> 01:33:26.229]  I mean, he's left this pile of dog, you know what, on Trump's doorstep.
[01:33:26.449 --> 01:33:27.909]  You know, John, here's what I'm really hoping.
[01:33:28.109 --> 01:33:36.510]  I'm hoping that Jake Sullivan talked to Michael Walsh, who's the incoming national security advisor, or President Biden who's talked to President Trump and said, here's what I'm gonna do.
[01:33:36.529 --> 01:33:43.289]  I'm really hoping that happened, because what he has done, Biden, Through his action, he's actually given President Trump more leverage.
[01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.630]  Really?
[01:33:43.729 --> 01:33:47.789]  Because now he can pull back, he can go left, he can go right, he can do something.
[01:33:47.989 --> 01:33:53.369]  I think what he did is he basically said, well, this is what I want to do, and I'm hoping there's something to this.
[01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:59.829]  I don't know, but it does give President Trump more ability to pivot from that.
[01:33:59.930 --> 01:34:00.510]  Oh, that's interesting.
[01:34:01.289 --> 01:34:04.569]  Just one quick question before we let you go, but it's like five seconds, General.
[01:34:04.930 --> 01:34:15.289]  So you're not buying the White House's, the Biden administration's justification that they launched, they approved these new long-range weapons because of the North Koreans on the ground inside Ukraine?
[01:34:15.390 --> 01:34:23.069]  It sounds good, but Jillian, what I'm really hoping is there was another reason to it, which allows, gives leverage to President Trump.
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:25.500]  Maybe that may be a good reason to do it.
[01:34:25.619 --> 01:34:27.819]  Look, they should have been doing this a year ago.
[01:34:28.899 --> 01:34:29.920]  They've basically pulled back.
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:33.819]  You don't fight a war allowing other countries to have sanctuaries.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.420]  If you're going to fight a war, you fight a war.
[01:34:35.819 --> 01:34:41.899]  And we've basically pulled back on letting Zelensky fight a war that he should have been fighting a long time ago.
[01:34:42.079 --> 01:34:43.880]  I know the casualties were horrific.
[01:34:44.039 --> 01:34:44.520]  Yeah, of course.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:48.680]  But the advantages that he had this last summer are not there anymore, he meaning Zelensky.
[01:34:48.779 --> 01:34:52.319]  Well, at the best of my knowledge, we haven't heard from Trump on the Use of the attack.
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:53.319]  And I think it's real.
[01:34:53.819 --> 01:34:56.420]  My thoughts to that are it's very smart.
[01:34:56.659 --> 01:34:56.819]  Okay.
[01:34:56.899 --> 01:34:57.340]  Hold fire.
[01:34:57.779 --> 01:34:58.020]  All right.
[01:34:58.359 --> 01:34:58.439]  Good.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:34:59.979]  General, great to see you back.
[01:35:00.119 --> 01:35:00.539]  Great to see you, sir.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.020]  Thanks for having more of you in the future.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.619]  It's very smart.
[01:35:04.979 --> 01:35:05.979]  Hold fire.
[01:35:07.399 --> 01:35:08.500]  Notice that doublespeak.
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:11.479]  So the U.S. is bombing Russia, which escalates.
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:15.439]  General Kellogg then says it's terrible they've escalated.
[01:35:15.579 --> 01:35:16.760]  Well, who escalated that?
[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:25.279]  If anybody has military knowledge or is logical, he was just feeding everybody a load of crap.
[01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:26.600]  Oh, we need to get rid of this war.
[01:35:26.739 --> 01:35:27.460]  Oh, it's really dangerous.
[01:35:27.479 --> 01:35:31.220]  And that's why we're bombing them, because that makes them ready to negotiate.
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:43.300]  Thank God the Russians don't have bases on our border blowing up stuff here, because the U.S. would not put up with that.
[01:35:45.619 --> 01:35:47.600]  And I don't need to sell people on that.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:48.560]  Everybody knows that.
[01:35:49.649 --> 01:35:55.310]  Alright, I am done covering this after I hit a few more little stories.
[01:35:57.409 --> 01:35:58.909]  And then I'm going to cover everything else.
[01:35:59.729 --> 01:36:00.550]  And you know what?
[01:36:02.250 --> 01:36:03.909]  Maybe I won't take calls today.
[01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:08.649]  Because I like taking calls, but I get so prepared for these shows.
[01:36:08.649 --> 01:36:13.170]  And then, with this World War III stuff being number one, I agree with Kellogg on that.
[01:36:13.229 --> 01:36:13.970]  That's the big issue.
[01:36:14.630 --> 01:36:15.670]  Because you don't deal with that.
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:18.180]  This is a real war, folks.
[01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:20.779]  This isn't like bombing Iraq or something, you know.
[01:36:22.380 --> 01:36:24.500]  It's like Martians attacking the Earth or something.
[01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:28.300]  No, this is really bad.
[01:36:29.039 --> 01:36:34.380]  But then I've got other stuff like this that's just so amazing.
[01:36:34.579 --> 01:36:35.779]  So amazing.
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:45.659]  Mainstream corporate media reporting the U.S. is building an early warning system to detect geoengineering?
[01:36:47.159 --> 01:36:49.520]  Well, I thought there's no geoengineering going on.
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:37:02.000]  Oh, but other governments are doing it, so the U.S. has to tell us all about how it exists and what's going on and how governments are spraying stuff added to the jet fuel that creates nuclei and cloud banks.
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:08.560]  And other governments are using antenna arrays, oh, like Doppler radar to control the weather.
[01:37:08.899 --> 01:37:11.600]  So separately, other people are doing it.
[01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:17.920]  But when we criticize our own government doing it, it suddenly doesn't exist.
[01:37:19.119 --> 01:37:20.520]  That's the type of stuff.
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:22.640]  Oh, AOC saying she might run for president?
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:26.859]  I've got the British government study.
[01:37:27.199 --> 01:37:36.779]  1.7 million children with different myocarditis and heart problems and death from the loving shots.
[01:37:37.399 --> 01:37:38.560]  That's government...
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.939]  Study with Oxford and Harvard.
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:43.579]  Kind of a big deal.
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.699]  I know that's old news for everybody here, but we did this to you.
[01:37:48.399 --> 01:37:49.300]  Isn't that nice?
[01:37:50.079 --> 01:37:51.680]  Just hiding in plain view.
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:52.739]  That's kind of important.
[01:37:53.899 --> 01:37:58.800]  And then we've got the new borders are and what he's saying he's going to do.
[01:37:58.939 --> 01:38:01.000]  We've got all these admissions of...
[01:38:02.170 --> 01:38:09.670]  What they're going to build if we don't stop big tech with the government and what living under the global social credit score AI run is going to be like.
[01:38:10.850 --> 01:38:29.609]  They just describe hell and why so many people in Silicon Valley have gotten behind Trump and what Elon Musk and myself and others have been warning of and so much more.
[01:38:32.509 --> 01:38:40.069]  But finishing up on the military news, Russia and China staged nuclear bomber exercises near U.S. allies.
[01:38:40.510 --> 01:38:53.069]  Russia and China sent nuclear-capable bombers over the waters between Japan and South Korea, which are the treaty allies of the United States, for their ninth Joint Strategic Air Patrol Friday.
[01:38:54.729 --> 01:39:06.510]  Two American conventional bombers on Monday simulated the release of weapons over Finland, a NATO ally that borders Russia and Japan and South Korea.
[01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:15.170]  The U.S. is committed to using its full range of military abilities, including nuclear, to support extended deterrences.
[01:39:15.529 --> 01:39:18.270]  So everybody's practicing attacking each other.
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:22.060]  World War, nuclear war, drills.
[01:39:22.439 --> 01:39:31.840]  The Chinese Defense Ministry said the Joint Bomber Patrol was conducted over the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea in South Korea.
[01:39:32.039 --> 01:39:41.500]  It is located between the Japanese archipelago to the east and the Korean Peninsula to the west and the Russian Far East region to the north.
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:43.399]  Hmm.
[01:39:44.699 --> 01:39:49.880]  Iran to begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges, UN watchdog says.
[01:39:50.319 --> 01:39:57.479]  AP. Yeah, they've been two weeks away from nuclear bombs since 2001. They got nuclear bombs.
[01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:05.140]  Putin's deadliest day with 2,000 troops lost on fastest advance since the invasion.
[01:40:07.039 --> 01:40:11.680]  Russia's war economy slows, new cracks after the ruble plunges.
[01:40:15.519 --> 01:40:19.699]  Jihadist allies enter Syria's second city in lightning assaults.
[01:40:19.699 --> 01:40:22.000]  So the proxy wars are breaking out everywhere.
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:23.399]  The West is backing these guys.
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:29.159]  Russia no longer trades in the dollar.
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:31.680]  Ruble is plunging.
[01:40:31.779 --> 01:40:34.159]  Russia's central bank halts U.S. dollar purchases.
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:39.640]  Russian central bank intervenes as ruble tumbles past 110 to the dollar.
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:44.880]  Russia-Ukraine war.
[01:40:45.039 --> 01:40:47.960]  Thousands of tired troops have deserted the Ukrainian army.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:52.600]  What a collapsing Russian ruble means for the Ukraine war.
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:41:02.340]  Russia's currency has continued to plunge, adding to the country's economic turbulence and raising questions about the financial stability of Vladimir Putin's aggression in Ukraine.
[01:41:04.079 --> 01:41:06.859]  So this is all part of asymmetrical warfare.
[01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:11.800]  Russian central bank takes desperate stand to halt collapsing ruble.
[01:41:12.890 --> 01:41:19.609]  And fierce inflation, most dangerous stage, the view from Russia as Ukraine war escalates.
[01:41:20.050 --> 01:41:27.369]  Last week, a defense industry site in the central Ukrainian city of Dinarpo was struck by a Russian medium-range ballistic missile.
[01:41:32.069 --> 01:41:33.250]  All right, so...
[01:41:34.239 --> 01:41:36.579]  This is all just completely out of control.
[01:41:37.079 --> 01:41:38.880]  Massive cyber attacks in Russia.
[01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:40.600]  Massive cyber attacks in China.
[01:41:40.979 --> 01:41:42.579]  Massive cyber attacks in Europe.
[01:41:42.779 --> 01:41:44.199]  Massive cyber attacks in America.
[01:41:46.079 --> 01:41:48.380]  This is all just asymmetrical war.
[01:41:48.739 --> 01:41:50.819]  Undersea cables getting cut all over the place.
[01:41:51.199 --> 01:41:52.260]  It's not good.
[01:41:53.899 --> 01:41:55.739]  Not good at all.
[01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:05.960]  And then we're also going to get into this.
[01:42:06.079 --> 01:42:11.380]  Australian Parliament banned social media for under 16s with the world's first law.
[01:42:12.039 --> 01:42:14.699]  That's also AP. A lot of people will say, oh, that's good.
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:15.399]  Protect the children.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:17.100]  No, it has nothing to do with that.
[01:42:18.079 --> 01:42:22.319]  How do you know that someone is under 16?
[01:42:23.439 --> 01:42:31.500]  What does everyone have to do to get on the internet to prove they're not 16 or younger?
[01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:46.789]  You have to have a digital government-issued internet ID that then tracks everywhere you go and what you do that will then be the social credit score enforcement to kick you off the internet if you don't behave.
[01:42:47.109 --> 01:42:54.229]  And then that leads to your vaccine passport that also is in a government database there that's all UN Bill Gates run as a beta test.
[01:42:56.649 --> 01:43:00.189]  Italy is trying to get this in place and it's all run by the UN and Bill Gates.
[01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.710]  Look it up.
[01:43:01.690 --> 01:43:11.869]  To standardize internet ID, the center of the wheel that all the other spokes go off of, of the Cashless Society control grid.
[01:43:11.890 --> 01:43:15.609]  And we're going to get to a lot on that and how that's already in place.
[01:43:15.609 --> 01:43:20.710]  They're just rolling it out now, coming up next hour.
[01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:23.250]  In fact, I'm going to hit that first.
[01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:27.069]  I've got a lot of preparation on this.
[01:43:30.810 --> 01:43:36.289]  So I'm going to hit that first when we start the next hour.
[01:43:36.289 --> 01:43:40.329]  And that ties into these big tech executives blowing the whistle on how this is all going to work.
[01:43:40.510 --> 01:43:43.210]  And I know for viewers, you already have heard this before.
[01:43:43.649 --> 01:43:49.430]  20 years ago, I was doing special reports on it from their own theoretical plans for all of this.
[01:43:49.529 --> 01:43:50.949]  But now we're not in theoretical.
[01:43:52.170 --> 01:43:53.210]  We're not in beta.
[01:43:53.369 --> 01:43:54.609]  We're not in testing phase.
[01:43:55.770 --> 01:43:57.970]  We are in the hot water.
[01:43:59.869 --> 01:44:05.329]  So I'm going to talk about where they are, what they're doing, how they want to roll it out, what it's going to look like if they do roll it out.
[01:44:05.949 --> 01:44:07.789]  China's already had this in place for eight years.
[01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:12.569]  In their own government spokesman's statement last year, he said, our system is now in place.
[01:44:13.050 --> 01:44:23.069]  For over 80% of the people in China, unless you live in a very rural area, you cannot go one half foot outside your door unless you're in compliance with whatever our latest policies are.
[01:44:23.310 --> 01:44:28.029]  And they can have their social credit score bar here and then raise it or change it.
[01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:30.109]  And selectively enforce it.
[01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:35.010]  It is a digital nightmare gulag archipelago.
[01:44:39.810 --> 01:44:50.930]  So, that's coming up next hour.
[01:44:51.090 --> 01:44:57.250]  And it ties into all the political correctness and the enforcement of the ESG scores, the corporate level down to your private.
[01:45:01.150 --> 01:45:17.810]  Social credit score that'll then be tied to universal basic income so that everybody is either penalized if you've got a well-paying job and part of your money's taken because you don't behave the way they want to people that totally comply get a bunch of free goodies.
[01:45:18.029 --> 01:45:24.010]  And of course, that's why you put a piece of cheese out for a mouse when it comes over to get a little treat.
[01:45:24.430 --> 01:45:26.829]  You're not putting the cheese out because you like the mouse.
[01:45:26.989 --> 01:45:29.350]  Or you put a minnow or a worm on the end of a hook.
[01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:31.880]  You're not doing it because you want to be nice to the fish.
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:32.859]  You want to eat the fish.
[01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:38.640]  So, how are they going to get it through?
[01:45:38.859 --> 01:45:43.520]  Well, they've got different systems everywhere, but here it's the reparations for black people.
[01:45:45.239 --> 01:45:47.520]  It's not about giving black people some money.
[01:45:48.659 --> 01:45:49.939]  It's about selling.
[01:45:50.180 --> 01:46:00.250]  Oh, certain groups get some free money so the globalists can set the precedent to discriminate And get past those laws on your behavior or who you are.
[01:46:00.930 --> 01:46:07.210]  And that is the ultimate social engineering system.
[01:46:09.449 --> 01:46:10.390]  All right.
[01:46:12.010 --> 01:46:20.970]  We are also going to get into that massive poison shot news and some of the biggest yet and so much more.
[01:46:22.069 --> 01:46:26.909]  I am going to start the third hour here in just a few minutes.
[01:46:28.329 --> 01:46:31.989]  But for those of you that are supporters, I want to thank you for your past support.

[01:46:41.470 --> 01:46:54.380]  If InfoWars get shut down, We're good to go.

[01:48:24.890 --> 01:48:26.210]  And then on top of it...
[01:48:27.149 --> 01:48:34.510]  You get sent another email with your code to get more free money to spend in the store.
[01:48:34.989 --> 01:48:42.250]  So these discounts are so great, but it's part of giving back to our supporters, thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:48:42.609 --> 01:48:48.109]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting to stop World War III. We are battling to get Trump into office.
[01:48:48.210 --> 01:48:49.569]  He's only president-elect right now.
[01:48:49.729 --> 01:48:51.449]  We are exposing the globalists.
[01:48:51.529 --> 01:48:54.489]  We are reaching 60, 70, 80 million people a day.
[01:48:54.630 --> 01:48:56.409]  We're back in the Infowars studios.
[01:48:56.689 --> 01:48:58.729]  The purchase was fraudulent.
[01:48:59.109 --> 01:49:01.210]  There's emergency hearings in court coming up next week.
[01:49:01.329 --> 01:49:07.050]  But regardless, I'm going to stay on air at the Alex Jones Network even if this shuts down.
[01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:12.529]  So when you go to our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, that's not owned by me.
[01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:21.210]  The Onion people and the National Gun Control Crew and the Democrats, even if they succeed, which I don't believe they will, will not get thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:24.590]  They will not get the Alex Jones Network because I don't own it.
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:30.159]  So when you support our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com with some of the most incredible supplements ever.
[01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:32.800]  The Superfood, Irish Sea Moss.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.220]  We have the strongest, most concentrated, incredible for your whole body.
[01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:37.739]  Take an hour to go through it all.
[01:49:37.899 --> 01:49:38.720]  Go check it out.
[01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:45.619]  That's their discounted up to 55% when you get three bottles, 50% when you get one bottle, 40% when you get one bottle.
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:46.359]  Try it.
[01:49:46.399 --> 01:49:47.020]  You're going to love it.
[01:49:47.079 --> 01:49:47.539]  I'm on it.
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:48.399]  I've lost so much weight.
[01:49:48.659 --> 01:49:49.359]  It's insane.
[01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:51.100]  Get that and other supplements and then...
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:55.180]  There's over 200 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies now there.
[01:49:55.340 --> 01:50:01.680]  These folks that own it bigly were already one of the top producers of Trump and Patriot gear.
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:02.640]  They had the best designs.
[01:50:03.039 --> 01:50:04.760]  All of the new Trump One gear.
[01:50:04.899 --> 01:50:07.239]  There's more than 40 shirts and hoodies and ball caps there.
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:08.899]  These designs are incredible.
[01:50:09.079 --> 01:50:15.319]  And now there's all these amazing Alex Jones shirts that are limited edition and will keep me on the air one way or another.
[01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:16.060]  Here they are.
[01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:17.010]  Look at this one.
[01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:21.090]  That famous meme of me coming out of the tunnel with all the Alex Jones clones.
[01:50:21.329 --> 01:50:23.109]  We are all Alex Jones.
[01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:24.270]  You've got to get that.
[01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:26.609]  Gay frogs equals extinction.
[01:50:26.909 --> 01:50:27.550]  Oh my goodness.
[01:50:28.010 --> 01:50:30.050]  What a way to wake folks up about all the poison in the water.
[01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:31.170]  That's now mainstream news.
[01:50:31.689 --> 01:50:34.550]  1984 is not an instruction manual.
[01:50:35.029 --> 01:50:36.170]  Team Humanity.
[01:50:36.430 --> 01:50:37.850]  Oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[01:50:37.989 --> 01:50:40.189]  Launched that over a year ago with Elon Musk.
[01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:42.130]  And then, Dale Grebel.
[01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:47.750]  Oh, warns you about the government was right the whole time.
[01:50:48.189 --> 01:50:49.069]  Darkest Hour.
[01:50:49.369 --> 01:50:50.550]  Me is Winston Churchill.
[01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:55.569]  And so much more at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:50:55.569 --> 01:50:57.810]  Now, we don't make a ton off the t-shirts.
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:03.180]  We don't make a ton off the supplements because there's not a lot of markup in those, but we do sell a lot.
[01:51:03.359 --> 01:51:15.800]  But where we do get major funds is the marked up classic Alex Jones Infowars red on navy blue shirt and a few other fundraiser shirts that aren't 25 or 30 bucks, they're 50, so we get real money in.
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:19.539]  Because these t-shirts are high quality, printed right here in Arkansas in the United States.
[01:51:19.980 --> 01:51:23.520]  And so, an extra, extra, extra large is like 16, 17 bucks.
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:25.960]  A small is like 15. The printing costs money.
[01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:27.380]  The sponsor gets part of the money.
[01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:28.699]  We get part of it to operate.
[01:51:29.340 --> 01:51:31.899]  We're making like six, seven bucks on the average t-shirt, which is great.
[01:51:32.039 --> 01:51:32.899]  And they spread the word.
[01:51:32.979 --> 01:51:33.659]  You meet like-minded people.
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:40.060]  But when you get the marked-up shirts, only two of them are marked up to 50, we get some real money in to the operation.
[01:51:40.119 --> 01:51:43.279]  So if you really want to support, get the fundraiser shirts.
[01:51:43.659 --> 01:51:54.300]  Also, The posters, limited edition, back-to-back-to-back Trump win, all those are marked up where they cost us six, seven bucks to print them and to put it in the tube.
[01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:56.899]  So we make like 40-something bucks off that.
[01:51:57.039 --> 01:52:07.199]  If you really want to support us and hang it on the wall and know you supported the second American Revolution right at the critical point, then get some of the limited edition posters as well.
[01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:09.180]  But regardless, you're going to love the supplements.
[01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:10.640]  You're going to want to order again.
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:13.079]  We can't stay on air without your support.
[01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:14.510]  I'm suing the deep state.
[01:52:14.649 --> 01:52:15.470]  We're going after them.
[01:52:15.569 --> 01:52:21.590]  We have put all the stuff they did and the bid rigging and everything in these lawsuits and court filings.
[01:52:21.930 --> 01:52:23.050]  We're going to win this thing.
[01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:26.810]  But regardless, we've got to have money to continue to fight them and stay on air.
[01:52:26.930 --> 01:52:36.409]  So go now to thealexjonesstore.com for amazing products and know you stood with fellow Americans at the critical time to save our republic.
[01:52:37.770 --> 01:52:40.390]  Thealexjonesstore.com Thank you so much for your support.
[01:52:42.569 --> 01:52:43.829]  Alright, here's what I'm going to do.
[01:52:44.810 --> 01:52:51.550]  When we come back, I'm going to get into how the globalists are going to roll out their cashless society and try to trick the public into accepting it.
[01:52:53.510 --> 01:53:10.890]  Then I'm going to get into the latest on what the so-called COVID vaccines really are and what they're doing to the public and just the ironclad information that's just confirmed everything we already knew.
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:12.920]  That's come out there.
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:16.899]  Then John Cusack has come out and attacked me today.
[01:53:19.739 --> 01:53:29.520]  And by the nature of his attack, I bet, I don't know this, but I bet my right arm he's been paid by a PR firm to just desperately come out and attack me.
[01:53:30.939 --> 01:53:37.039]  Because of the nature of the way the attack happened, they used their little trump card, Sandy Hook, Sandy Hook.
[01:53:37.770 --> 01:53:39.430]  It just never ends.
[01:53:40.789 --> 01:53:42.670]  So, hilarious.
[01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:45.449]  That's all these guys got.
[01:53:45.649 --> 01:53:46.689]  They're not relevant.
[01:53:46.890 --> 01:53:47.529]  They're a joke.
[01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:50.810]  The Sandy Hook people live off me.
[01:53:50.810 --> 01:53:51.829]  I don't live off them.
[01:53:51.989 --> 01:53:53.390]  I barely even ever talked about them.
[01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:54.369]  Everybody already knows that.
[01:53:55.970 --> 01:54:01.210]  But I wanted to play a couple clips from the Russian foreign minister, Lavrov.
[01:54:02.869 --> 01:54:04.010]  There's several of these.
[01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:13.939]  Getting into what happened to Julian Assange, but also how NATO and bookbams are to blame for the war.
[01:54:14.239 --> 01:54:16.420]  Listen to this, because it is about social issues.
[01:54:16.479 --> 01:54:19.880]  Why they want to take down Russia is because they're not chopping their sons' penises off.
[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:20.340]  Here it is.
[01:54:21.359 --> 01:54:23.880]  Let's remember the situation with Julian Assange.
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:39.060]  It was a bullying that lasted for years, and everyone has certainly watched it, and the truth has become the vivid illustration of what would occur to the strong opponents to the West.
[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:43.100]  It will be a lesson for all the dissenters.
[01:54:43.649 --> 01:55:00.050]  It is telling that despite many disagreements with the opinion of Julian Assange as investigative journalist, Russia was almost the only country that consistently raised its voice for him, while all the free speech advocates, the so-called human rights defenders,
[01:55:00.710 --> 01:55:02.810]  didn't put in a good word for him.
[01:55:03.489 --> 01:55:14.329]  I need to say that fakes and lies and information wars won't help Kyiv regime and all the objectives and goals of the special military operation will be fulfilled.
[01:55:14.630 --> 01:55:29.350]  And as Vladimir Putin has stated many times, with peaceful political and diplomatic means that the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis won't be durable and lasting if its root causes are not addressed.
[01:55:30.630 --> 01:56:00.859]  They include posing long-term threats to Russia's security in the western direction by NATO's eastward expansion and by adding Ukraine to NATO. And among the root causes is the systematic actions of the Kyiv regime to Eliminate the rights of Russian and Russian-speaking citizens of their country by banning the
[01:56:00.859 --> 01:56:14.680]  instruction in Russian at all stages, starting from the maternity schools, finishing with the higher education, banning the broadcasting in Russian, banning cultural events.
[01:56:15.239 --> 01:56:25.739]  Just as during the Third Reich, They are throwing away books in Russian from libraries.
[01:56:28.039 --> 01:56:31.760]  Yep, it's about erasing Russian culture that is Ukrainian culture.
[01:56:31.899 --> 01:56:43.680]  We're going to come back and I'm going to break down the global rollout of the cashless society control grid that we're very, very close to.
[01:56:44.119 --> 01:56:46.659]  And I'll show you all the documents and articles and clips.
[01:56:48.319 --> 01:56:51.399]  But remember, you can basically search anything I say and pull it up for yourself.
[01:56:51.539 --> 01:56:51.859]  We'll be right back.
[01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:55.600]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:57:01.020]  We're now into hour number three of this Friday, November 29th, 2024 transmission.
[01:57:01.819 --> 01:57:10.380]  I want to do the deep dive on the globalist endgame and their control grid, the cashless society, the social credit score.
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:13.659]  But the most important thing before we do this deep dive is this.
[01:57:15.619 --> 01:57:32.840]  Bill Gates and the UN, along with Google and the private central banks, the EU, NATO, the Australian government, New Zealand government, the Brazilian government, over 150 governments.
[01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:37.920]  And they've been testing it in China and in places like Nigeria.
[01:57:40.159 --> 01:57:53.560]  And When you hear you will eat the bugs, when you hear we're going to take beef away from you, when you hear they're going to genetically engineer cows so they don't fart methane, I mean, this is a total takeover of everything.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:06.479]  And the Cashless Society AI monitoring is just the data collection for the enforcement of all the other systems.
[01:58:07.619 --> 01:58:13.859]  And if you're a good little globalist or one of their corporate minions or leaders, you're basically exempt from all of this.
[01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:16.960]  The average person doesn't get any real protein.
[01:58:17.159 --> 01:58:18.819]  The average person doesn't get to travel.
[01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:20.640]  The average person doesn't have a job.
[01:58:20.819 --> 01:58:22.220]  The average person's displaced.
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:27.199]  The average person's pushed to commit suicide, to be euthanized by the government.
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:29.399]  I mean, this is a dystopic system.
[01:58:29.539 --> 01:58:34.220]  200 square foot apartments, 15 minute prison cities.
[01:58:35.409 --> 01:58:37.630]  So all of this is interconnected in their own admissions.
[01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:56.989]  And you can look, Bill Gates and the EU and the UN and China have standardized the new World ID and standardized the new global vaccine passport and standardized, you know, the international insurance associations and the international restaurant associations and the international airport associations.
[01:58:57.869 --> 01:59:05.569]  Where nobody will be able to fly or move without a smartphone and a QR code that's activated when you've done everything you're supposed to do.
[01:59:05.890 --> 01:59:08.810]  So you watch, you know, from 10 years ago, a Dark Mirror episode.
[01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:11.850]  You think, man, that's terrible.
[01:59:12.090 --> 01:59:15.869]  That's nothing compared to what they're actually going to do with this.
[01:59:17.329 --> 01:59:19.810]  And they can always make you do more, more, more.
[01:59:20.649 --> 01:59:23.229]  They can tell you where to spend your money, how to spend your money.
[01:59:24.180 --> 01:59:31.500]  As the head of the Communist Chinese Party said last year, or the head of their tech group, he said, we've already got our social credit score system in.
[01:59:31.619 --> 01:59:32.420]  It's perfected.
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:34.239]  80 plus percent of the country has it.
[01:59:34.319 --> 01:59:35.239]  You can look these quotes up.
[01:59:35.859 --> 01:59:45.659]  And he said, our mission is you cannot go one half step outside your apartment door if you're not in compliance with the rules and regulations of the party.
[01:59:46.739 --> 01:59:53.500]  So it turns the whole world into a giant control freak supermax prison, a prison planet.
[01:59:58.579 --> 02:00:08.380]  Now, you've already heard of debanking and political correctness, and this has been happening to myself and the Trumps and gun manufacturers and everybody for decades.
[02:00:08.779 --> 02:00:10.500]  And now it's super intense.
[02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:20.560]  And they want these regulations in place where it's not just racketeering a bunch of corporations ganging up with their own secret databases, and you don't know why you've been debanked.
[02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:21.340]  You don't know why.
[02:00:22.119 --> 02:00:25.779]  You can't get a loan even though you've had good credit.
[02:00:27.409 --> 02:00:30.189]  That's racketeering where they do it through color of law secretly.
[02:00:30.489 --> 02:00:33.869]  They want this all officially out in the open.
[02:00:38.109 --> 02:00:50.170]  And Mark Andressen, who's the inventor of a whole bunch of computer systems and browsers and owner of Netscape and sold it to AOL and he's a billionaire.
[02:00:50.729 --> 02:00:52.130]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[02:00:52.409 --> 02:00:52.630]  Mosaic.
[02:00:53.489 --> 02:01:04.829]  And he is a large owner of hundreds of major tech companies and is seen as an intellectual leader in Silicon Valley.
[02:01:05.090 --> 02:01:07.689]  He went on Joe Rogan earlier in the week.
[02:01:08.750 --> 02:01:10.489]  And it's since been viral everywhere.
[02:01:10.729 --> 02:01:12.069]  Elon Musk has been posting everywhere.
[02:01:12.310 --> 02:01:14.949]  Hundreds and hundreds of millions of views of the clubs.
[02:01:16.329 --> 02:01:16.810]  And...
[02:01:18.710 --> 02:01:19.489]  He's dead on.
[02:01:19.789 --> 02:01:35.029]  And Joe, who I've been explaining this to for decades, is just freaking out about it, because here's this very respected guy, he's done a long time, saying, look, I'm in the secret meetings with the top billionaires, and the government came in under Biden and said, we're going to have total monopoly,
[02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:45.890]  it's going to run every fast of your life, we're going to shut down all the rest of the economy, we're going to make people obsolete, no startups of any type in farming, or mechanics, or industry, or computers.
[02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:51.439]  Absolute total control over everything you do.
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:53.119]  And he did several hours.
[02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:55.420]  He starts out with the debanking.
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.220]  And then he walks Joe through it all.
[02:01:58.319 --> 02:02:02.119]  So I've got an hour or more of clips of him.
[02:02:02.819 --> 02:02:04.720]  And everything he says is dead on.
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:09.279]  But then he says things like, but it's legal for the banks to do this.
[02:02:10.899 --> 02:02:15.500]  Banks to all get organized together and discriminate against certain people because of their political beliefs.
[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:17.600]  No, there's laws against that.
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:18.600]  It's a civil rights violation.
[02:02:18.779 --> 02:02:19.699]  It's a conspiracy against rights.
[02:02:19.699 --> 02:02:22.020]  But the banks sure think it's legal.
[02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:23.619]  Well, they sure don't want it public.
[02:02:23.819 --> 02:02:29.600]  I was given four years ago by a major bank that I'd used for 20 years here in Texas.
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:35.659]  And the banker didn't like the fact they were ordered to kick us off the bank.
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:40.260]  And then we had the highest credit score for a merchant account you could have.
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:42.199]  Almost no chargebacks.
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:43.220]  Great delivery.
[02:02:44.100 --> 02:02:45.899]  Just no complaints, basically.
[02:02:47.170 --> 02:02:54.550]  And they gave us the document but said you can't show it to anybody because there's computerized watermarks in the digital copy.
[02:02:56.189 --> 02:03:11.029]  And it said, out of this globalist rating agency, that Jones is a political problem and that Jones is involved in hate and that Jones is hereby sanctioned.
[02:03:12.189 --> 02:03:17.470]  Now, there's still little banks and things that are able to get around this, but under this new system coming in, it won't be there.
[02:03:17.949 --> 02:03:19.789]  And you'll be monitored in live time.
[02:03:20.630 --> 02:03:24.350]  Everything you do, even if you pay cash, you'll be face scanned, and it'll be on record.
[02:03:24.569 --> 02:03:31.369]  You got Bitcoin, they're going to make you face scan, not the Bitcoin people, but when you try to interface with any other financial systems.
[02:03:32.569 --> 02:03:36.550]  So, yeah, Bitcoin's the answer to counter this, but they're bringing an end to counter Bitcoin.
[02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:39.930]  So it's the best of times, worst of times, tell it to cities.
[02:03:42.869 --> 02:03:45.090]  And so he goes over all this.
[02:03:45.189 --> 02:04:04.189]  So before I get to the latest developments and talk about how they're going to bring in the Internet ID that is the center hub for all of this, because everything's the Internet now, let's go to an eight-minute clip of him on Joe Rogan getting into how this works.
[02:04:04.189 --> 02:04:04.710]  Here it is.
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:07.880]  Can you give me an example?
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.720]  You know, debanking.
[02:04:10.199 --> 02:04:13.100]  This is where a lot of the debanking comes from, is these agencies.
[02:04:13.319 --> 02:04:17.840]  So debanking is when you as either a person or your company are literally kicked out of the banking system.
[02:04:17.979 --> 02:04:18.779]  Like they did to Kanye.
[02:04:19.159 --> 02:04:20.300]  Exactly, like they did to Kanye.
[02:04:20.619 --> 02:04:22.739]  My partner Ben's father has been debanked.
[02:04:23.180 --> 02:04:23.439]  Really?
[02:04:23.539 --> 02:04:24.260]  We had an employee.
[02:04:24.439 --> 02:04:24.800]  For what?
[02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:26.350]  For having the wrong politics.
[02:04:26.750 --> 02:04:28.109]  For saying unacceptable things.
[02:04:29.970 --> 02:04:31.550]  Okay, here's a great thing.
[02:04:31.670 --> 02:04:44.649]  Under current banking regulations, after all the reforms of the last 20 years, there's now a category called a politically exposed person, PEP. And if you are a PEP, you are required by financial regulators to kick them out of your bank.
[02:04:44.850 --> 02:04:45.189]  What?
[02:04:45.369 --> 02:04:47.109]  What if you're politically on the left?
[02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:48.029]  That's fine.
[02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:51.159]  Because they're not politically exposed.
[02:04:51.380 --> 02:04:52.939]  So no one on the left gets debanked?
[02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:55.380]  I have not heard of a single instance of anyone on the left getting debanked.
[02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:57.619]  Can you tell me what the person that you know did?
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:04:59.659]  What they said that got them debanked?
[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:01.119]  David Horowitz is a right wing.
[02:05:01.279 --> 02:05:01.979]  He's pro-Trump.
[02:05:02.119 --> 02:05:03.119]  He's said all kinds of things.
[02:05:03.279 --> 02:05:05.060]  He's been very anti-Islamic terrorism.
[02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:07.640]  He's been very worried about immigration, all these things.
[02:05:07.779 --> 02:05:08.819]  And they debanked him for that?
[02:05:08.859 --> 02:05:09.619]  Yeah, they debanked him.
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:11.619]  So you get kicked out of your bank account.
[02:05:11.779 --> 02:05:14.140]  You can't do credit card transactions.
[02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:16.439]  How is that legal?
[02:05:16.619 --> 02:05:17.100]  Well, exactly.
[02:05:17.340 --> 02:05:18.199]  So this is the thing.
[02:05:18.359 --> 02:05:20.300]  And then you go into this thing of like, well, there's no...
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:32.119]  This is where the government and the companies get intertwined, back to your fascism point, which is there's a constitutional amendment that says the government can't restrict your speech, but there's no constitutional amendment that says the government can't debank you, right?
[02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:34.640]  And so if they can't do the one thing, they do the other thing.
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:35.920]  And then they don't have to debank you.
[02:05:35.979 --> 02:05:39.180]  They just have to put pressure on the private company banks to do it.
[02:05:39.380 --> 02:05:42.020]  And then the private company banks do it because they're expected to.
[02:05:42.350 --> 02:05:43.989]  But the government gets to say, we didn't do it.
[02:05:44.109 --> 02:05:45.510]  It was the private company that did it.
[02:05:45.609 --> 02:05:48.890]  And of course, JP Morgan can decide who they want to have as customers, of course, right?
[02:05:49.069 --> 02:05:49.949]  It's their private company.
[02:05:50.210 --> 02:05:52.810]  And so it's this sleight of hand that happens.
[02:05:53.210 --> 02:06:00.489]  So it's basically, it's a privatized sanctions regime that lets bureaucrats do to American citizens the same thing that we do to Iran.
[02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:01.500]  Whoa.
[02:06:01.619 --> 02:06:02.680]  Kick you out of the financial system.
[02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:06.079]  And so this has been happening to all the crypto entrepreneurs in the last four years.
[02:06:06.220 --> 02:06:12.380]  This has been happening to a lot of the fintech entrepreneurs, anybody trying to start any kind of new banking service because they're trying to protect the big banks.
[02:06:13.239 --> 02:06:17.739]  And then this has been happening, by the way, also in legal fields of economic activity that they don't like.
[02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:29.630]  And so a lot of this started about 15 years ago with this thing called Operation Short Point, where they decided to, as marijuana started to become legal, as prostitution started to become legal, and then guns, which there's always a fight about.
[02:06:30.109 --> 02:06:41.739]  Under the Obama administration, they started to debank Legal marijuana businesses, escort businesses, and then gun shops, just like your gun manufacturers, and just like you're done, you're out of the banking system.
[02:06:42.100 --> 02:06:46.899]  And so if you're running a medical marijuana dispensary in 2012, guess what?
[02:06:46.979 --> 02:06:55.859]  You're doing your business all in cash, because you literally can't get a bank account, you can't get a visa terminal, you can't process transactions, you can't do payroll, you can't do direct deposit, you can't get insurance.
[02:06:56.490 --> 02:06:58.850]  Like, none of that stuff is, you've been sanctioned, right?
[02:06:58.850 --> 02:06:59.710]  None of that stuff is available.
[02:06:59.829 --> 02:07:06.770]  And then this administration extended that concept to apply it to tech founders, crypto founders, and then just generally political opponents.
[02:07:07.550 --> 02:07:10.449]  Yeah, so that's been, like, super pernicious.
[02:07:10.630 --> 02:07:11.569]  I wasn't aware of that.
[02:07:11.729 --> 02:07:12.170]  Oh, 100%.
[02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:17.300]  So it's Operation Shortpoint 1.0 was 15 years ago against the pot and the guns.
[02:07:18.159 --> 02:07:23.159]  Shortpoint 2.0 is primarily against their political enemies and then to their disfavored tech startups.
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:24.979]  And it's hit the tech world hard.
[02:07:24.979 --> 02:07:27.979]  We've had like 30 founders debanked in the last four years.
[02:07:28.020 --> 02:07:28.119]  Real?
[02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:28.760]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:07:28.859 --> 02:07:30.720]  It's been a big recurring pattern.
[02:07:30.939 --> 02:07:31.180]  30?
[02:07:31.439 --> 02:07:34.140]  This is one of the reasons why we ended up supporting Trump.
[02:07:34.260 --> 02:07:35.319]  It's like we just can't...
[02:07:35.630 --> 02:07:36.550]  We can't live in this world.
[02:07:36.649 --> 02:07:46.050]  We can't live in a world where somebody starts a company that's a completely legal thing and then they literally get sanctioned and embargoed by the United States government through a completely unaccountable...
[02:07:46.050 --> 02:07:47.770]  By the way, no due process.
[02:07:48.010 --> 02:07:49.149]  None of this is written down.
[02:07:49.729 --> 02:07:50.710]  There's no rules.
[02:07:51.090 --> 02:07:51.989]  There's no court.
[02:07:52.689 --> 02:07:54.210]  There's no decision process.
[02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:55.449]  There's no appeal.
[02:07:55.949 --> 02:07:57.029]  Who do you appeal to?
[02:07:57.529 --> 02:08:00.229]  Who do you go to to get your bank account back?
[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:11.819]  And then there's also the civil asset forfeiture side of it, which is right the other side, and that doesn't happen to us, but that happens to people in a lot of places now who get arrested and all of a sudden the state takes their money.
[02:08:12.159 --> 02:08:16.319]  Yes, but that happens to people if they get pulled over and they have a large amount of cash in some states.
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:30.260]  Right, or there'll be well-publicized examples of there'll be some investigation into safe deposit boxes, and the next thing you know, the feds have seized all the contents of the state deposit, safe deposit boxes, and that stuff never gets returned.
[02:08:30.689 --> 02:08:33.750]  And this is when Trump says the deep state.
[02:08:34.229 --> 02:08:37.210]  The way we would describe it is it's administrative power.
[02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:40.829]  It's political power being administered not through legislation.
[02:08:41.409 --> 02:08:43.529]  So there's no defined law that covers this.
[02:08:43.689 --> 02:08:44.710]  It's not through regulation.
[02:08:45.649 --> 02:08:48.029]  You can't go sue a regulator to fix this.
[02:08:48.350 --> 02:08:50.510]  It's not through any kind of court judgment.
[02:08:50.890 --> 02:08:52.470]  It's just raw power.
[02:08:52.770 --> 02:08:54.510]  It's just raw administrative power.
[02:08:54.670 --> 02:08:59.810]  It's the government or politicians just deciding that things are going to be a certain way and then they just apply pressure until they get it.
[02:09:00.069 --> 02:09:03.329]  So what happens to those 30 tech people that you know?
[02:09:03.710 --> 02:09:05.210]  Start to go into a different field.
[02:09:05.550 --> 02:09:09.149]  Like, try to do something different and try to get, you know...
[02:09:09.149 --> 02:09:09.189]  Whoa!
[02:09:09.189 --> 02:09:10.170]  Complete upending of your life.
[02:09:10.210 --> 02:09:11.130]  Yeah, complete upending of your life.
[02:09:11.250 --> 02:09:13.090]  And try to, yeah, try to change your life.
[02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:14.229]  Try to get out of the...
[02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:15.750]  Try to get away from the Eye of Sauron.
[02:09:16.189 --> 02:09:19.010]  Try to get out of whatever zone got you into this.
[02:09:19.529 --> 02:09:26.470]  And keep applying for new bank accounts at different banks and hope that at some point a bank will say, okay, it's okay, we've checked and it's now all right.
[02:09:26.869 --> 02:09:27.229]  Whoa!
[02:09:27.649 --> 02:09:29.970]  But there's no- So what do they do with their money?
[02:09:30.090 --> 02:09:30.789]  What happens?
[02:09:31.229 --> 02:09:32.250]  I mean, you go to cash.
[02:09:32.829 --> 02:09:33.949]  You go to cash?
[02:09:34.090 --> 02:09:35.170]  You can't have a- Yeah.
[02:09:35.489 --> 02:09:36.369]  So where do you put it?
[02:09:36.789 --> 02:09:37.949]  Under your mattress.
[02:09:40.789 --> 02:09:41.170]  Yes, exactly.
[02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.869]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:09:41.869 --> 02:09:42.890]  That is so insane.
[02:09:42.989 --> 02:09:46.390]  So if someone has $30 million in the bank and they get debanked.
[02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:51.789]  Diamonds, art, you know, do you, I don't know, go overseas somewhere?
[02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:53.149]  Holy shit!
[02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:53.750]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:09:53.869 --> 02:09:55.250]  It just happens.
[02:09:55.409 --> 02:09:56.750]  And again, it's really, really important.
[02:09:56.930 --> 02:09:57.649]  There's no fingerprints.
[02:09:57.850 --> 02:09:58.489]  Like, there's no...
[02:09:59.039 --> 02:09:59.359]  Right.
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:00.659]  There's no person who...
[02:10:00.659 --> 02:10:02.479]  There's no stick above the strings.
[02:10:02.779 --> 02:10:03.439]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:10:03.659 --> 02:10:03.779]  Right.
[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:04.600]  It just happened.
[02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:13.800]  And we can trace it back, because we know the politicians involved, and we know how the agencies work, and we know how the pressure's applied, and we know that the banks get phone calls and so forth.
[02:10:14.439 --> 02:10:23.039]  We can loosely, like, we understand the flow of power as it happens, but when you're on the receiving end of this, your specific instance of it, like, you can't trace it back and there's nothing you can do about it.
[02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:24.479]  So, what are the instances?
[02:10:24.779 --> 02:10:29.680]  Like, what is the company, what are they trying to do, and how do they run afoul?
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:32.680]  Well, all the crypto startups in the last, basically, four years.
[02:10:32.819 --> 02:10:39.039]  So, remember the crypto thing got, like, really, you know, sort of everybody got excited and, like, NFTs and, like, all that stuff, and then it just, like, stopped.
[02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:39.579]  Yeah.
[02:10:39.819 --> 02:10:56.359]  And the reason it stopped is because basically every crypto founder, every crypto startup, they either got debanked personally and forced out of the industry, or their company got debanked and so it couldn't keep operating, or they got prosecuted, charged, or they got threatened with being charged.
[02:10:57.060 --> 02:10:59.420]  This is a fun little twist.
[02:10:59.739 --> 02:11:07.880]  So the SEC sort of has been trying to kill the crypto industry under Biden, and this has been a big issue for us because we're the biggest crypto startup investor.
[02:11:08.810 --> 02:11:12.949]  The SEC, they can investigate you, they can subpoena you, they can prosecute you, they can do all these things.
[02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:15.750]  But they don't have to do any of those things to really damage you.
[02:11:15.810 --> 02:11:17.850]  All they have to do is they issue what's called a Wells Notice.
[02:11:18.390 --> 02:11:21.470]  And the Wells Notice is a notification that you may be charged at some point in the future.
[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:27.359]  You're like on notice that you might be doing something wrong and they might be coming after you at some point in the future.
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:28.279]  Oh my god.
[02:11:29.060 --> 02:11:29.420]  Terrifying.
[02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:30.260]  That's the eye.
[02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:31.859]  The eye of Sauron is on you.
[02:11:32.619 --> 02:11:35.880]  Now, trying to be a company with a Wells notice doing business with anybody else.
[02:11:36.399 --> 02:11:37.380]  Oh my god.
[02:11:37.619 --> 02:11:37.720]  Right.
[02:11:37.859 --> 02:11:39.119]  Try to work with a big company.
[02:11:39.220 --> 02:11:40.239]  Try to get access to a bank.
[02:11:40.399 --> 02:11:41.220]  Try to do anything.
[02:11:41.359 --> 02:11:43.020]  So that's when they support DEI initiatives.
[02:11:43.939 --> 02:11:53.920]  Well, then the SEC under Biden became a The SEC under Biden became a direct application of DEI. They did a lot with that and then all the ESG stuff.
[02:11:54.079 --> 02:11:57.680]  And ESG is a very malleable concept and they piled all kinds of new requirements into that.
[02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:02.119]  So through this process, the SEC could basically just simply dictate what companies do.
[02:12:03.050 --> 02:12:04.630]  With no accountability at all.
[02:12:04.869 --> 02:12:09.810]  There are hearings where they get yelled at, but nothing changed.
[02:12:09.970 --> 02:12:11.649]  Nothing ever happened in a hearing that ever changed anything.
[02:12:12.189 --> 02:12:14.090]  It was just the raw application of power.
[02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:18.329]  And this is your friends, this has happened to.
[02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.930]  Oh yeah, for sure.
[02:12:19.069 --> 02:12:22.329]  Like I said, we had an employee who got debanked because he had crypto in his job title.
[02:12:22.909 --> 02:12:25.609]  He was doing crypto policy for us and his bank.
[02:12:27.530 --> 02:12:28.010]  That's it?
[02:12:28.109 --> 02:12:33.069]  Because they did a screen across, it's what they told us, is they did a screen across their customer base.
[02:12:33.930 --> 02:12:34.810]  Anyone with crypto.
[02:12:35.029 --> 02:12:37.789]  Because anybody with crypto became a politically exposed person.
[02:12:38.609 --> 02:12:38.970]  Wow.
[02:12:39.390 --> 02:12:39.949]  All right.
[02:12:40.130 --> 02:12:44.050]  Now, he gets into more complex current things and where it's going.
[02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:44.989]  We'll get to those clips in a moment.
[02:12:45.069 --> 02:12:48.710]  But he's laying out kind of the baby steps for Joe.
[02:12:48.850 --> 02:12:52.550]  And I'm not putting Joe down, but I've told Joe this over and over again, and he finds it hard to believe.
[02:12:53.820 --> 02:12:55.840]  But Joe now is really concerned.
[02:12:56.060 --> 02:12:57.020]  I've been talking to him about it.
[02:12:57.500 --> 02:12:59.899]  The point is, this is already way advanced.
[02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:05.699]  So the debanking and the secret databases and the ESGs, that's at the corporate level.
[02:13:05.779 --> 02:13:07.960]  They've already got the social credit score globally.
[02:13:09.239 --> 02:13:10.420]  And you heard him.
[02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:12.760]  They can just pile on into that anything they want.
[02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:14.100]  So first, it's marijuana.
[02:13:16.150 --> 02:13:23.770]  Then it's anybody's CBD. There's no, you know, none of the chemical in there that gets you high.
[02:13:24.289 --> 02:13:24.970]  Doesn't matter.
[02:13:25.890 --> 02:13:28.470]  And then it's, oh, it's gun shops.
[02:13:28.609 --> 02:13:29.649]  Then it's sporting goods stores.
[02:13:29.829 --> 02:13:33.670]  Then it's, you wonder why all these big companies say, we're no longer going to sell guns.
[02:13:34.449 --> 02:13:36.289]  Like Dick's Sporting Goods and the rest of it.
[02:13:36.829 --> 02:13:40.010]  Because of the corporate ESG score.
[02:13:40.270 --> 02:13:41.670]  And who sets the score?
[02:13:42.109 --> 02:13:42.550]  BlackRock.
[02:13:43.619 --> 02:14:07.710]  That's why Texas and a bunch of other states suing BlackRock that's coming up is so important because we have to exercise our power on them because these big corporations have gotten together and they're exercising governmental level tyrannical power that we would never put up with from government Through them acting like it's all legal,
[02:14:07.710 --> 02:14:10.010]  but even on the current laws, it's not.
[02:14:10.170 --> 02:14:13.189]  It's just not enforced by this corrupt Justice Department.
[02:14:16.750 --> 02:14:19.550]  And then again, you have the AI to enforce it all.
[02:14:19.710 --> 02:14:28.069]  You're like, well, I just won't interface with AI. You'll have to have an internet ID that they're selling worldwide to, quote, keep kids safe.
[02:14:28.250 --> 02:14:40.430]  But to prove you're not a kid, everybody's got to enter the ID. Now that ID is the basis of the database that is already there being used to track everything you do, to control what you do.
[02:14:41.199 --> 02:14:50.520]  To take money out of your bank accounts in a unified ledger, this has all been announced, where you don't own your house, you don't own your stocks and bonds, you don't own your 401k, you don't own your bank account.
[02:14:50.979 --> 02:14:57.039]  It's all in a big derivative bubble that they can use and control all mixed together.
[02:14:57.380 --> 02:15:12.119]  So it takes all the previous scams of the private Federal Reserve and Bernie Madoff and Sam Binkman Freed, and it makes them look like A grain of sand compared to all the beaches and all the sand in the world.
[02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:15.460]  And again, it's all selectively enforced.
[02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:16.640]  It's all invisible.
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:19.640]  It controls your medical records.
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:21.720]  It controls whether you could have a job.
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:22.899]  Did you have all your shots?
[02:15:22.899 --> 02:15:23.979]  There's not even a law.
[02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:29.880]  You've got to have the shots to have a job, but no one will employ you because there is a global corporate governance.
[02:15:30.399 --> 02:15:31.420]  What's the new world order?
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:42.460]  Global corporate governance through AI. And the general public, even people that think they're informed, don't know about this.
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:45.100]  Don't understand this.
[02:15:45.979 --> 02:15:47.840]  Because to them, well, that's illegal.
[02:15:48.079 --> 02:15:48.880]  I mean, that's tyranny.
[02:15:50.119 --> 02:16:04.819]  And under the ESG system, in their own admissions from the UN and BlackRock, which we've read on air and made reports on and shown you, it says everything you do that has carbon involved will be given a rating, tracked, and controlled.
[02:16:05.909 --> 02:16:07.489]  And you are the carbon they want to reduce.
[02:16:07.670 --> 02:16:09.489]  And basically everything is carbon.
[02:16:12.250 --> 02:16:13.989]  So you don't get any energy.
[02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:21.430]  You get taxed for using energy for your farm or your machine shop or your mechanic shop or your school.
[02:16:21.869 --> 02:16:28.609]  But if you're a globalist school or shop or business that does all the other things they tell you to, well, suddenly you're allowed to operate.
[02:16:29.390 --> 02:16:30.529]  You're allowed to get your energy.
[02:16:30.850 --> 02:16:33.430]  Big tech can have all the energy at once.
[02:16:33.590 --> 02:16:36.770]  It can build its own private nuclear reactors, but you can't.
[02:16:37.010 --> 02:16:43.129]  Your state has to go to the federal government, this is the same all over the world, and say, hey, a big Blue Norther is coming in.
[02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:43.850]  Remember two years ago?
[02:16:43.969 --> 02:16:45.510]  We need to up the power.
[02:16:45.829 --> 02:16:46.489]  Nope, sorry.
[02:16:46.969 --> 02:16:54.590]  We won't just fine you a million dollars per minute to your power production plants.
[02:16:55.389 --> 02:16:56.409]  A million bucks a minute.
[02:16:56.610 --> 02:17:12.629]  When you go above this level of power production, we will criminally charge you, the Biden administration, told Texas, Missouri, and other states, if you up the power, and then the blackouts happened,
[02:17:12.729 --> 02:17:26.739]  and we were plunged into two weeks of no power, and I pointed it out, And the media said Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist when it's the federal regulations, not law.
[02:17:27.739 --> 02:17:39.079]  Remember the Supreme Court two years ago ruled, you can't have the EPA and all these groups in the Department of Energy saying we have regulations that aren't passed by Congress, that aren't laws.
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:41.500]  To do all this, you have to stop.
[02:17:41.659 --> 02:17:42.639]  But they didn't stop.
[02:17:43.579 --> 02:17:44.780]  Trump will stop them.
[02:17:45.909 --> 02:17:50.469]  But he was just a four-year pause on this, accelerated under Obama, accelerated under Biden.
[02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:55.209]  No matter where you live, Sri Lanka, Japan, Germany, it's the same.
[02:17:56.489 --> 02:18:01.409]  Now China and India and Mexico, they don't follow it, but the globalists are all invested there.
[02:18:01.649 --> 02:18:04.569]  They've got all their industries running at full power, totally dirty.
[02:18:05.709 --> 02:18:09.790]  This is designed to pick and choose winners and losers.
[02:18:11.510 --> 02:18:14.069]  And now Texas and 10 other states are suing over it.
[02:18:14.149 --> 02:18:14.629]  We'll get to that.
[02:18:14.690 --> 02:18:18.170]  But I want to come back with more clips from Andresen.
[02:18:19.350 --> 02:18:27.469]  On the other side, it gets a lot more hardcore, where he's in the meetings with the globalists, and they explain, we're shutting everything down.
[02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:31.290]  Not just, no, no other tech startups are allowed.
[02:18:31.469 --> 02:18:32.750]  No other companies are allowed.
[02:18:33.010 --> 02:18:35.030]  The SEC will come after you.
[02:18:35.510 --> 02:18:36.450]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:18:37.309 --> 02:18:37.750]  Everything.
[02:18:39.590 --> 02:18:56.709]  Every business, every company has to follow the rules and then be absorbed, and then they're going to lay everybody off and say, don't worry, we've got a universal basic income, but now with that comes total control, and there's no economy left to be able to live on the margins or hide from it.
[02:18:56.850 --> 02:19:01.670]  It forces you under the beast system that you must worship to take part in.
[02:19:01.709 --> 02:19:03.170]  You must follow its every order.
[02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:04.469]  That's what worship is.
[02:19:05.229 --> 02:19:05.829]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:05.930 --> 02:19:06.309]  Stay with us.
[02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:11.729]  I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's going to save this country and nothing's going to stop it.
[02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:16.290]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[02:19:16.489 --> 02:19:19.110]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[02:19:19.129 --> 02:19:19.989]  I'm still not in shape.
[02:19:20.950 --> 02:19:22.309]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[02:19:22.450 --> 02:19:23.389]  Don't tell me you're eating right.
[02:19:23.489 --> 02:19:24.110]  I'm not going to bite it.
[02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:27.750]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[02:19:28.170 --> 02:19:28.729]  I'm working.
[02:19:29.069 --> 02:19:29.590]  Oh, no.
[02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:32.450]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:34.469]  Listen, I did it all.
[02:19:34.979 --> 02:19:38.559]  From the AlexJonesStore.com with Ultimate Seamoss, the ultimate seafood.
[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:39.500]  That's why, right here.
[02:19:40.180 --> 02:19:45.340]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:47.139]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[02:19:47.459 --> 02:19:49.059]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[02:19:51.780 --> 02:19:59.020]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss, and I am doing a plug here, because, you know, we could be shut down next Tuesday.
[02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:05.840]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court, but we'll continue on in the year one way or another, working with great folks.
[02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:10.940]  The new world order is dystopia by design.
[02:20:12.239 --> 02:20:19.360]  Maximum evil carried out against the human species.
[02:20:20.909 --> 02:20:23.649]  In a giant satanic ritual against God's creation.
[02:20:24.989 --> 02:20:51.920]  Alright, so, highly respected tech billionaire, the developer of so much of what you see today, Mark, has come out and gone on the Joe Rogan show and said that he's been in these meetings With the globalists,
[02:20:52.139 --> 02:21:10.559]  which we already know, we see the policies, we see the reports, where they explain absolute total monopoly and control over every facet of human activity and life, and a monopoly over information,
[02:21:11.020 --> 02:21:16.200]  business, the shutdown of any startups of any type, not just big tech.
[02:21:17.109 --> 02:21:20.350]  This is what the globalist monopoly is all about.
[02:21:20.549 --> 02:21:21.090]  Here's another clip.
[02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:26.909]  And that's why this administration freaked us out so much, is because it felt like they were trying to become way more like China.
[02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:32.370]  See, I was not nearly as aware as I should have been about all these things you're saying.
[02:21:32.549 --> 02:21:33.209]  I didn't know this.
[02:21:33.309 --> 02:21:38.610]  I did know about the banks, and I certainly didn't know that they were cracking down on AI the same way they cracked down on social media.
[02:21:38.989 --> 02:21:40.069]  The AI thing was very alarming.
[02:21:40.229 --> 02:21:47.440]  We had meetings this spring that were the most alarming meetings I've ever been in, where they were taking us through their plans, and it was Can you talk about it?
[02:21:47.479 --> 02:21:49.239]  Basically, just full government control.
[02:21:49.799 --> 02:21:50.540]  This sort of thing.
[02:21:50.659 --> 02:21:54.280]  There will be a small number of large companies that will be completely regulated and controlled by the government.
[02:21:54.479 --> 02:21:57.219]  They told us, they just said, don't even start startups.
[02:21:57.360 --> 02:21:57.899]  Don't even bother.
[02:21:58.459 --> 02:21:59.280]  There's just no way.
[02:21:59.420 --> 02:22:00.620]  There's no way that they can succeed.
[02:22:00.739 --> 02:22:02.159]  There's no way that we're going to permit that to happen.
[02:22:02.500 --> 02:22:02.860]  Wow.
[02:22:03.139 --> 02:22:04.280]  They said, this is already over.
[02:22:04.379 --> 02:22:08.280]  It's going to be two or three companies, and we're going to control them, and that's that.
[02:22:08.399 --> 02:22:09.280]  This is already finished.
[02:22:09.459 --> 02:22:10.200]  Oh, my God.
[02:22:10.420 --> 02:22:12.860]  When you leave a meeting like that, what do you do?
[02:22:13.180 --> 02:22:14.399]  You go endorse Donald Trump.
[02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:23.850]  Now again, all these clips in my mind, I have something I want to say about each little piece of it.
[02:22:25.409 --> 02:22:25.829]  But...
[02:22:26.969 --> 02:22:29.549]  Again, this is not just with AI. It's with everything.
[02:22:29.790 --> 02:22:30.670]  In their own admissions.
[02:22:30.889 --> 02:22:36.389]  Total monopoly over everything to the engineer society and whoever's left in it the way these people want.
[02:22:36.649 --> 02:22:39.270]  And I've had Henry Kissinger try to hire me.
[02:22:39.750 --> 02:22:43.129]  I've had the globalist over and over again say, Alex, the public's too dumb.
[02:22:43.250 --> 02:22:43.930]  They're too worthless.
[02:22:44.250 --> 02:22:46.809]  You'll never be able to get them to rally for their own future.
[02:22:47.049 --> 02:22:47.909]  Just join us.
[02:22:48.010 --> 02:22:49.889]  The fact you understand it means you should be with us.
[02:22:50.049 --> 02:22:50.889]  It's disgusting.
[02:22:52.299 --> 02:22:53.959]  But notice humanity is waking up.
[02:22:54.040 --> 02:22:57.159]  We are turning the tide, but not fast enough.
[02:22:58.239 --> 02:23:00.899]  So it doesn't matter whether the public wakes up or not.
[02:23:01.079 --> 02:23:12.139]  I refuse to be part of this satanic, degenerate, ejecting kids with stuff that destroys their immune system and takes decades off their lives and turns them into invalids for the system.
[02:23:12.959 --> 02:23:14.540]  These people are disgusting.
[02:23:19.090 --> 02:23:22.889]  And I just want people to wake up and understand you're under attack and then get organized against it.
[02:23:22.930 --> 02:23:23.909]  And that's coming up in a moment.
[02:23:26.729 --> 02:23:32.770]  Play clip 45. Mark Andressen, they're already tested this level of control on the food system.
[02:23:38.299 --> 02:23:39.600]  Back to the doge for a moment.
[02:23:39.959 --> 02:23:47.979]  So, one of the reasons why everybody became unhealthy is because the government directly exerted, put itself into the food system, and specifically, high-fructose corn syrup.
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:52.959]  Right, high-fructose corn syrup was an artifact of government agriculture subsidies, right?
[02:23:53.120 --> 02:23:56.079]  The country was- Which was good during World War II, because we needed food.
[02:23:56.200 --> 02:23:56.739]  At one time.
[02:23:56.940 --> 02:23:57.100]  Yeah.
[02:23:57.299 --> 02:23:57.399]  Right.
[02:23:57.540 --> 02:24:01.840]  But, like, by the 1970s, we were massively overproducing, specifically, we were massively overproducing corn.
[02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:05.840]  And the corn lobby, the sort of agriculture lobby became very powerful.
[02:24:05.979 --> 02:24:11.819]  And we have this government agency, one of the 450 government agencies is the USDA. And the USDA has a dual mandate.
[02:24:12.239 --> 02:24:17.420]  It's to promote U.S. agriculture, specifically things like corn, and it's also to advise us on what we should eat.
[02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:18.760]  And they also do the food pyramid.
[02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:35.620]  And that's why the food pyramid is upside down, right, for all those decades, where we're supposed to eat carbs and not protein and fat, was because literally that's the agency that's responsible for promoting agriculture, and then that agency has inserted itself through laws, regulations, and this kind of administrative pressure,
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:42.760]  and basically said, thou shalt use high-fructose corn syrup because it is a byproduct of corn, as opposed to sugar.
[02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:52.020]  And as we now know, that was a Absolutely poisonous decision, like that was like literal poison, absolutely a ruinous decision, just an absolutely terrible idea.
[02:24:52.860 --> 02:24:59.719]  But they knew what they were doing, just like putting flora in the water in 45. I got a bunch on that coming up.
[02:25:00.100 --> 02:25:03.680]  But here's a really important clip, once I give you the rest of the story.
[02:25:05.420 --> 02:25:12.799]  Here we're talking about the numbers of the federal employees that don't even do any work now, and it's moved into the county and city employees and everywhere.
[02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:14.399]  Why would you do that?
[02:25:14.500 --> 02:25:15.840]  Why would you defund the police?
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.239]  You want to make society break down.
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:35.000]  You make the military breakdown, and then you've got to bring in the AI and the robots to replace the humans, to make the humans obsolete, so then they can start saying, like Canada and the Netherlands, well, let us euthanize you because you don't have a place here in society,
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:41.739]  and the government can come in and say, like the Netherlands and Canada, and say, we're saying you're a ward of the state.
[02:25:41.739 --> 02:25:46.440]  We're saying we are your guardian now, and we've decided to kill you.
[02:25:47.389 --> 02:25:48.489]  That's not even euthanasia.
[02:25:48.590 --> 02:25:50.149]  That's government genocide.
[02:25:50.149 --> 02:25:50.969]  That's murder.
[02:25:57.729 --> 02:26:07.909]  So let's play clip 44 about the government workers since COVID, which was all designed basically doing no work.
[02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.370]  Here it is.
[02:26:09.769 --> 02:26:11.670]  You know, most federal workers never came back to work.
[02:26:12.549 --> 02:26:12.909]  Really?
[02:26:13.170 --> 02:26:14.329]  Yeah, they work from home.
[02:26:14.889 --> 02:26:15.250]  Most?
[02:26:15.430 --> 02:26:15.709]  Most.
[02:26:16.030 --> 02:26:17.309]  Yeah, a very large percentage.
[02:26:17.489 --> 02:26:19.469]  Something like half just literally just never came back.
[02:26:19.850 --> 02:26:20.149]  Whoa!
[02:26:20.409 --> 02:26:24.549]  They still, by the way, still draw a paycheck, they're still on their jobs, but literally they're not in the office.
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:32.319]  Or in some cases, they have an agreement where there's one agency, I won't name, but there's one agency where there's, okay, here's another great thing.
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:40.500]  There are agencies of the federal government whose workforces are both civil servants, have full civil service protections and unionized.
[02:26:42.409 --> 02:26:46.850]  Entirely paid for by the taxpayer, but they both have civil service protections, which, by the way, are totally made up.
[02:26:46.969 --> 02:26:49.309]  There's no concept in the Constitution of civil service protections.
[02:26:49.309 --> 02:26:50.569]  It's just a totally made-up thing.
[02:26:50.989 --> 02:26:51.950]  And they're unionized.
[02:26:52.110 --> 02:26:58.770]  And there's a particular agency that I know of where the union negotiated the return of the office from COVID, and the agreement was you have to be in the office one day a month.
[02:26:59.629 --> 02:26:59.909]  Whoa!
[02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:07.569]  And actually, the pattern now is what they do is the employees come in on the last day of the month and the first day of the following month, so they only have to be there for two days.
[02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:08.370]  For two months.
[02:27:08.510 --> 02:27:09.489]  Out of 60 days.
[02:27:09.729 --> 02:27:10.569]  That's crazy.
[02:27:11.209 --> 02:27:14.750]  As a consequence, many of them have actually left the area, right?
[02:27:14.850 --> 02:27:18.629]  Because they get their government paycheck, which is calibrated for living there, and then they go live someplace nice.
[02:27:18.770 --> 02:27:23.409]  You know, someplace nice, but, you know, they go live in the Ozarks or something, where the cost of living is cheaper, and they have a bigger house.
[02:27:24.110 --> 02:27:26.729]  And, you know, in theory, they're working from home, but, like...
[02:27:27.870 --> 02:27:29.110]  Is it actually happening?
[02:27:29.389 --> 02:27:30.549]  And again, this is the Doge.
[02:27:30.629 --> 02:27:32.770]  This is one of the things, the Doge, they've already announced.
[02:27:33.450 --> 02:27:36.270]  The thing they've said is, you can work from home, just not for the federal government.
[02:27:38.030 --> 02:27:44.030]  And so when people are talking about, is the Doge going to be able to do anything, it's just, okay, there's 50% of the federal workforce.
[02:27:45.770 --> 02:27:49.329]  Right, and as a taxpayer, how do you feel about that?
[02:27:49.469 --> 02:27:56.850]  And to your point on paying taxes, if those people are in the office and they're dynamos of activity and they're making the country better, fair enough.
[02:27:56.950 --> 02:27:57.329]  Of course.
[02:27:57.450 --> 02:27:59.950]  But if they're kicking it at home, maybe not.
[02:28:00.190 --> 02:28:00.809]  Yeah, maybe not.
[02:28:02.190 --> 02:28:05.190]  And again, what did Klaus Schwab say?
[02:28:05.809 --> 02:28:13.840]  This is the great reset, getting ready for carbon lockdowns, whether you're in Australia, Germany, England, the US. It's the same.
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.420]  It's over 80% only coming about one week a month.
[02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:18.659]  They were already doing almost nothing.
[02:28:18.799 --> 02:28:22.520]  Now they're being trained to do nothing as this special class.
[02:28:22.639 --> 02:28:24.860]  And when people attack this, they go, oh, they're lazy.
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:28.040]  Oh, their unions did this.
[02:28:28.239 --> 02:28:28.399]  No.
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:30.219]  Yeah, their unions went along with it.
[02:28:30.379 --> 02:28:41.059]  This is done to sabotage the human infrastructure To where people are totally domesticated and dependent on a robotic AI system.
[02:28:41.379 --> 02:28:44.760]  This is the rolling up and the sabotaging of human systems.
[02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:49.100]  And everywhere, the UN says organic farming is the worst, must be banned.
[02:28:49.260 --> 02:28:52.280]  England's passed all these laws are shutting down most of it.
[02:28:53.700 --> 02:28:58.200]  They pay them to just get rid of their property and not do anything with it.
[02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:06.329]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on.
[02:29:08.409 --> 02:29:11.129]  And then, oh, make the kids be trained at home.
[02:29:12.290 --> 02:29:13.489]  Kids don't go into school.
[02:29:16.270 --> 02:29:20.170]  And then now it's big tech coming in to create the curriculums.
[02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:21.870]  And it backfires.
[02:29:22.049 --> 02:29:24.930]  Parents actually stayed home during the lockdowns and saw what their kids were being taught and flipped out.
[02:29:25.229 --> 02:29:27.430]  So this thing is easy to beat.
[02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:37.000]  If you come to the realization of the full horror of it, and you understand the technocrats that came up with this plan, they themselves are deceived.
[02:29:39.379 --> 02:29:47.110]  Because when I talk about, if you really study this whole thing, and Aren't even a conspiracy theorist.
[02:29:47.209 --> 02:29:49.409]  You just logically say, what is anti-human?
[02:29:49.569 --> 02:29:50.670]  Why are they anti-carbon?
[02:29:50.930 --> 02:29:52.649]  Why are they sabotaging our genetics?
[02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:54.969]  Why are they injecting us with stuff that mutates our genetics?
[02:29:55.290 --> 02:29:59.690]  And you look at all the things going on, and it's like, wow, this is like an alien attack.
[02:30:00.590 --> 02:30:05.750]  You just introduce ideas, introduce culture to the elites that bring in anti-human systems.
[02:30:05.770 --> 02:30:11.409]  You slowly cut off the resources while poisoning and dumbing people down and poisoning our genetics and mutating us.
[02:30:12.969 --> 02:30:14.889]  And then the human civilization falls apart.
[02:30:15.030 --> 02:30:15.690]  It's not dynamic.
[02:30:15.690 --> 02:30:16.370]  It's depressed.
[02:30:16.590 --> 02:30:17.870]  It's demoralized.
[02:30:18.809 --> 02:30:24.389]  And then Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and Yuval Noah Harari and all of them say, oh, don't worry.
[02:30:24.510 --> 02:30:25.590]  Humans were a bad species.
[02:30:25.870 --> 02:30:29.170]  We're going to merge with machines and become gods, those that survive.
[02:30:29.430 --> 02:30:33.190]  And you're like, wait, that's the Thabian socialists.
[02:30:33.329 --> 02:30:34.870]  That's Arthur C. Clarke.
[02:30:35.010 --> 02:30:36.170]  That's childhood's end.
[02:30:38.950 --> 02:30:41.909]  They've been writing about this since the 30s.
[02:30:43.520 --> 02:30:52.280]  Theoretically about this new change in ending humanity and becoming a machine, and then they're just getting rid of all the biological human systems.
[02:30:53.879 --> 02:31:01.280]  Not because we're bad and we're bad with the earth, but because this is a off-world alien agenda.
[02:31:13.969 --> 02:31:15.049]  Alright, I've got more clips.
[02:31:16.209 --> 02:31:17.250]  I've got a lot more.
[02:31:17.889 --> 02:31:20.709]  See, I haven't even gotten into one of my stacks yet.
[02:31:20.850 --> 02:31:23.170]  I have five stacks on the AI takeover.
[02:31:23.469 --> 02:31:47.100]  When we come back, I'm going to get into how they're implementing it, how we stop it, and then the traitors against our own species 99% of which don't even know why they're doing it.
[02:31:47.180 --> 02:31:50.159]  They just know they get rewarded when they follow through on these orders.
[02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:52.500]  Like...
[02:31:52.500 --> 02:31:56.620]  John Cusack attacking me today.
[02:31:57.260 --> 02:31:58.280]  And Joe Rogan.
[02:32:00.780 --> 02:32:01.940]  And that's all they got.
[02:32:04.340 --> 02:32:06.540]  Is a bunch of actors...
[02:32:08.949 --> 02:32:11.590]  Actors out on loan to the New World Order.
[02:32:12.409 --> 02:32:15.690]  Alright, and then I'm going to get into the poison shot news and everything else.
[02:32:16.250 --> 02:32:16.649]  Yep.
[02:32:17.090 --> 02:32:20.090]  I wasn't going to take calls today, but...
[02:32:20.090 --> 02:32:24.690]  This is what it's like, though.
[02:32:24.809 --> 02:32:25.930]  I just...
[02:32:25.930 --> 02:32:28.969]  We just have to reject it all.
[02:32:30.370 --> 02:32:33.649]  And we've got to understand that it's not work to fight evil.
[02:32:33.649 --> 02:32:34.969]  It's what you're meant to do.
[02:32:35.090 --> 02:32:38.290]  Your survival instinct, your will to thrive, what God made you to be.
[02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:42.819]  The potential of a pro-human destiny, Team Humanity.
[02:32:43.639 --> 02:32:45.459]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:32:45.819 --> 02:33:01.000]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, InfoWars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[02:33:01.260 --> 02:33:06.579]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public, and people can just put in one bid.
[02:33:07.409 --> 02:33:10.450]  And then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[02:33:10.930 --> 02:33:14.809]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might tell you tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[02:33:14.930 --> 02:33:15.430]  Who knows?
[02:33:15.969 --> 02:33:18.430]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[02:33:18.729 --> 02:33:33.090]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty, having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and when they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:37.479]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at InfoWars.
[02:33:37.639 --> 02:33:50.239]  But regardless, our great sponsors at thealexjonesstore.com with incredible supplements and amazing Patriot gear have been helping us continue to stay on air and prepare to launch the Alex Jones Network.
[02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:51.899]  Where we won't miss a beat.
[02:33:52.100 --> 02:34:06.659]  And if you remember when they first came on three months ago as a sponsor, they launched that incredible Super Dodge pickup giveaway sweepstakes, where every time you buy something at theologistrestore.com, you get entered to win the raffle for the truck.
[02:34:07.059 --> 02:34:10.860]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in.
[02:34:10.979 --> 02:34:14.399]  But that's going to get announced, the winner, here in just a few days.
[02:34:14.559 --> 02:34:18.620]  And regardless of whether InfoWars is on the air or not, the Alex Jones Network will be on air.
[02:34:18.719 --> 02:34:22.100]  And so you'll see the winner, the announcement, we're going to invite them to Austin, and so much more.
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:23.260]  So now...
[02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:31.299]  We were going to do this in a few weeks, but now our great sponsor is doing it early because we're calling it the Darkest Hour giveaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:31.659 --> 02:34:37.180]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[02:34:37.420 --> 02:34:38.639]  I'll read over the specs in a moment.
[02:34:38.819 --> 02:34:39.780]  It's a beautiful truck.

[02:36:48.250 --> 02:36:50.809]  I've been obsessing over World War III, and that is important to do.
[02:36:53.309 --> 02:36:56.530]  To actually cover all the research I do here on air.
[02:36:58.969 --> 02:37:01.549]  The problem is...
[02:37:01.549 --> 02:37:09.170]  I get pissed off when I'm researching all this.
[02:37:12.379 --> 02:37:18.739]  And then when I start covering it again, because for me I've already researched it, then I'm doing it again, I'm just disgusted.
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:20.639]  And I'm not complaining.
[02:37:20.799 --> 02:37:25.459]  And look, I know it's hard to hear the truth too at some levels, but isn't it refreshing to also know what you're up against?
[02:37:27.139 --> 02:37:30.000]  But yeah, I apologize to the crew and listeners.
[02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:34.100]  I've been a baby in the last hour or some, but I just...
[02:37:36.090 --> 02:37:38.309]  I just can't believe that we're putting up with this.
[02:37:38.489 --> 02:37:40.750]  I believe in humanity too much.
[02:37:41.010 --> 02:37:42.670]  And I am angry.
[02:37:46.510 --> 02:37:53.629]  You know, Thomas Jefferson said it one way.
[02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:54.709]  Edmund Burke said it another.
[02:37:55.370 --> 02:37:59.450]  But all that evil needs to flourish is that good people do nothing.
[02:38:00.809 --> 02:38:20.489]  And I should be incredibly positive that Because if you look at where we've come with almost nobody being aware of this takeover plan to a majority of people starting to wake up and concerned, a large minority that are aware of a lot of the projects and operations,
[02:38:20.489 --> 02:38:23.989]  it's very positive.
[02:38:26.409 --> 02:38:38.950]  But we do not have enough people That absolutely understand the compendium of the big picture.
[02:38:39.450 --> 02:38:48.510]  Because if I could just get people to understand that as bad as I say things are, as evil as I say these people are...
[02:38:53.719 --> 02:38:54.979]  I can't even describe it.
[02:38:56.639 --> 02:39:01.000]  It's not just that they want to kill 90 plus percent of the public in their own public documents.
[02:39:01.299 --> 02:39:13.940]  It's that they enjoy dumbing people down, hurting people, making them desperate, manipulating them, making them become evil because they think that's how they survive.
[02:39:14.540 --> 02:39:17.940]  It's all a giant process to get your soul.
[02:39:19.959 --> 02:39:50.329]  And then when you see the extraterrestrial anti-human movement, and you know that it's alien, And you know that we're electrochemical beings and you know they've proven in tens of thousands of studies that we have a sixth sense and that our brains and spinal cords and nerves electrochemically
[02:39:50.329 --> 02:40:10.649]  transmit and receive, that our DNA is a receiver transmitter and that the aliens don't attack you in little flying saucers from Mars like Mars attacks, that it is an interdimensional attack and that They want to kill us.
[02:40:10.750 --> 02:40:12.309]  It's a military attack.
[02:40:17.709 --> 02:40:31.649]  And that you have to tune in to God and God's transmission that built us and will transcend it instantly the moment we individually and then collectively do that.
[02:40:33.159 --> 02:40:41.139]  And it's just so unbelievable to know how real all this is and to see it, but it must be like in Rowdy Piper, they live.
[02:40:43.260 --> 02:40:49.280]  Imagine wearing the sunglasses and you can't even get people to put them on.
[02:40:52.979 --> 02:40:57.840]  And even those, you can get to put them on and say, I can't handle this, I want to take them off.
[02:40:57.920 --> 02:40:59.280]  It's like in The Matrix when he says, you know...
[02:41:00.579 --> 02:41:01.579]  I went back in the Matrix.
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:02.340]  I don't want to remember anything.
[02:41:02.459 --> 02:41:04.280]  I just want to be a famous movie star.
[02:41:04.459 --> 02:41:05.180]  And that's what it is.
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:10.200]  So many people wake up to this and they actually join it.
[02:41:12.459 --> 02:41:13.899]  But I guess, I don't guess.
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  I know that's just God's plan.
[02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:19.180]  But as for me, there's not even a choice here.
[02:41:19.239 --> 02:41:20.920]  I don't know how anybody joins with Satan.
[02:41:22.229 --> 02:41:23.549]  I just can't even understand it.
[02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:24.190]  We'll be right back.
[02:41:24.309 --> 02:41:24.629]  Stay with me.
[02:41:25.450 --> 02:41:26.649]  Alright, I don't do it often.
[02:41:27.370 --> 02:41:28.649]  Get overly angry on air.
[02:41:29.069 --> 02:41:32.670]  People used to love it, you know, years ago and I'd blow up and stuff at least once a week.
[02:41:32.829 --> 02:41:33.790]  Well, it was never an act.
[02:41:34.129 --> 02:41:35.190]  I don't do that anymore.
[02:41:36.370 --> 02:41:37.850]  It's more of a controlled rage.
[02:41:38.809 --> 02:41:41.829]  But I gotta remember, we don't do this because we hate the bad guys.
[02:41:41.829 --> 02:41:46.530]  We do it because we love the women and children and people we're protecting that are behind us.
[02:41:49.729 --> 02:41:58.010]  So, I really should have started this whole hour-long breakdown with the good news.
[02:41:59.590 --> 02:42:02.590]  Folks are waking up that there's a predatory globalist system.
[02:42:02.950 --> 02:42:06.629]  They're actually reading the books and statements and operational manuals of the bad guys.
[02:42:07.049 --> 02:42:09.030]  They're so arrogant, they really haven't hidden it.
[02:42:09.090 --> 02:42:09.569]  But it's more than that.
[02:42:09.850 --> 02:42:11.590]  Metaphysically, there's a rule.
[02:42:11.709 --> 02:42:13.590]  They gotta tell you in the fine print what they're doing.
[02:42:16.270 --> 02:42:41.069]  And I want to get to the solutions and the good news and then drill in to how the bad guys are currently rolling out the fulcrum or the nerve center or the wheel to which the spokes go out to the larger operation.
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:42.639]  And it's real simple.
[02:42:43.180 --> 02:42:46.120]  It's stated, it's the UN, it's Bill Gates, it is.
[02:42:46.559 --> 02:42:59.440]  Internet ID. And whether you're in the United States, or whether you're in Canada, or whether, you know, they can't get the feds to pass it, New York, all these places want Internet ID so kids don't see violence and porn.
[02:43:00.219 --> 02:43:02.440]  No, parents shouldn't be giving them devices.
[02:43:02.659 --> 02:43:04.760]  Parents should have the controls on their parents.
[02:43:07.969 --> 02:43:12.430]  But instead, oh no, we need an internet ID to keep 16 and under off the internet.
[02:43:17.329 --> 02:43:19.309]  Texas, you know, trying to pass laws.
[02:43:19.450 --> 02:43:20.709]  Don't let kids see porn.
[02:43:23.260 --> 02:43:24.719]  And the Republicans trying to pass it.
[02:43:24.819 --> 02:43:27.280]  Meanwhile, they're like, well, kids shouldn't have access to this.
[02:43:27.420 --> 02:43:36.860]  It's not the government's place because it's admitted that the Internet ID... Oh, just kids are going to have one?
[02:43:36.979 --> 02:43:37.200]  No.
[02:43:37.479 --> 02:43:41.579]  No, they admit in all the legislation that just passed Australia, it's the same thing everywhere.
[02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:50.260]  Everyone's got to put the ID in, and in that database, everywhere you go, what you do...
[02:43:52.549 --> 02:44:12.809]  All the apps you've got now legally and lawfully can be shared with all the corporations and governments, and then they can bring in the social credit score over it to penalize you for your legal and lawful behavior and reward people that do what they're told and go along with this evil social justice system.
[02:44:14.510 --> 02:44:15.989]  This is mind control.
[02:44:16.729 --> 02:44:19.549]  This is putting you in a digital mind control harness.
[02:44:19.809 --> 02:44:35.569]  I can play you WEF videos from this year and last year where they get up and say, oh, all these big corporations like IBM make their employees wear earbuds that track your brain waves and read your brain, and then your boss calls in and can tell you've not been doing your work.
[02:44:38.090 --> 02:44:40.270]  That's one step away from the brain chip.
[02:44:42.489 --> 02:44:44.229]  People go, ah, Elon Musk.
[02:44:44.329 --> 02:44:45.569]  I thought Elon Musk was good.
[02:44:45.629 --> 02:44:46.370]  He wants Neuralink.
[02:44:47.290 --> 02:44:48.350]  It's like a gun.
[02:44:50.149 --> 02:44:53.370]  Guns are great in the hands of good people.
[02:44:54.350 --> 02:44:56.750]  And you're not going to keep them out of the hands of bad people.
[02:44:57.209 --> 02:44:59.209]  So I just say have no gun laws.
[02:44:59.329 --> 02:45:02.010]  And that's how it used to be when crime was almost non-existent.
[02:45:02.690 --> 02:45:04.049]  Because people get their asses blown off.
[02:45:04.770 --> 02:45:17.370]  If I am in a car wreck, God forbid, next week, and break my neck and am paralyzed from the neck down, do I want to have a chip in my spine, which they're coming out with, that gives me...
[02:45:17.370 --> 02:45:22.569]  Because they can't fix the spinal cord, but they can wire it in between there, and suddenly I can walk again.
[02:45:22.590 --> 02:45:23.969]  I'll take a chip in two seconds.
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:41.399]  This is a global chip over all your activity monitoring you externally that manipulates your behavior through stimuli where you don't need a chip to now be an android because you're following the directives of it.
[02:45:41.459 --> 02:45:45.379]  And that's all the different patents about how we don't need chips.
[02:45:45.559 --> 02:45:51.760]  We just have all the stimuli and the controls in your car, in your phone, in your computer, in your appliances, in your boss, in your job.
[02:45:53.959 --> 02:45:54.479]  Everywhere.
[02:45:58.100 --> 02:46:00.340]  I get my car that's more modern.
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:02.940]  I'm going to get rid of it and just get an old vehicle for now.
[02:46:03.659 --> 02:46:06.180]  Now they want to ban all the old vehicles because they want to make you have it.
[02:46:06.940 --> 02:46:09.059]  And it knows that I'm going to be going home.
[02:46:09.059 --> 02:46:09.639]  It knows.
[02:46:09.639 --> 02:46:10.340]  It can figure that.
[02:46:10.420 --> 02:46:12.379]  So it goes, here's where you get home.
[02:46:12.559 --> 02:46:13.360]  I'm like, funny.
[02:46:13.479 --> 02:46:16.399]  I've got all that location stuff turned off in my phone.
[02:46:16.540 --> 02:46:20.459]  And I've turned it off at least 50 times in this car that I've had for seven, eight years.
[02:46:20.860 --> 02:46:24.340]  And I got to bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, go in and turn it off.
[02:46:25.209 --> 02:46:26.629]  Because it turns it back on.
[02:46:26.790 --> 02:46:30.329]  And it's like, look, I'll show you how to go home, or I'll show you...
[02:46:30.329 --> 02:46:34.889]  I was out hiking with my oldest daughter a few days ago on the hiking bike trail.
[02:46:38.110 --> 02:46:45.149]  And she pulls her phone out to take a picture, and I said, honey, did you ask that to tell you where the car is?
[02:46:46.540 --> 02:46:50.979]  She goes, no, it just says 27 minutes away at the current walking speed.
[02:46:50.979 --> 02:46:52.000]  I wasn't even in this.
[02:46:52.159 --> 02:46:54.200]  I don't know why Google's telling me where the car is.
[02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:56.639]  But see, it just figures you're going back towards your car.
[02:46:56.739 --> 02:46:57.459]  Maybe you want to know.
[02:46:58.579 --> 02:46:59.959]  And it's so easy.
[02:46:59.959 --> 02:47:00.979]  It's so helpful.
[02:47:00.979 --> 02:47:01.840]  It's so nice.
[02:47:01.959 --> 02:47:04.180]  It's so promiscuous.
[02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:06.920]  Incestuous.
[02:47:09.840 --> 02:47:15.319]  But for the service you're using it for, that's just the worm on the hook, the cheese on the...
[02:47:17.269 --> 02:47:20.309]  Mousetrap to get you to adopt it and use it.
[02:47:22.190 --> 02:47:25.229]  So it's how the chips are deployed.
[02:47:25.389 --> 02:47:27.969]  It's what type of chip it is.
[02:47:28.530 --> 02:47:29.430]  My uncle.
[02:47:30.829 --> 02:47:32.770]  Motorcycle accident decades ago.
[02:47:33.309 --> 02:47:34.489]  Brain out on the pavement.
[02:47:35.209 --> 02:47:38.229]  Has his mental faculties but had speech impediments since then.
[02:47:39.069 --> 02:47:41.030]  But still just as smart as he was.
[02:47:41.649 --> 02:47:42.549]  Really smart guy.
[02:47:42.610 --> 02:47:43.110]  My dad's brother.
[02:47:46.579 --> 02:47:49.979]  Had to take all these depressants to not have convulsions every day.
[02:47:50.879 --> 02:47:52.200]  Made his life miserable.
[02:47:53.479 --> 02:47:56.559]  Got a chip stimulator on the vagus nerve.
[02:47:57.299 --> 02:48:00.780]  Almost ended his seizures.
[02:48:01.879 --> 02:48:04.700]  Then went and got a fancier one in the brain.
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:07.360]  Doesn't have seizures anymore.
[02:48:09.239 --> 02:48:11.139]  He'd gotten so bad he was in a wheelchair.
[02:48:11.739 --> 02:48:12.719]  Now he's not.
[02:48:15.739 --> 02:48:28.860]  But every time I see him, and we're having dinner, or out feeding the horses, he'll be sitting there talking to me, and just like out of a movie, he'll be going, and I tell you what, I was over there.
[02:48:32.020 --> 02:48:34.079]  I haven't pulled my phone out yet to do it.
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:36.819]  I'm sure he'll let me do it.
[02:48:37.379 --> 02:48:38.979]  And it's literally digital.
[02:48:40.850 --> 02:48:50.110]  And a digital thing goes into his brain to stimulate, and when it sees a storm in the brain, it knocks the storm out.
[02:48:50.389 --> 02:48:53.389]  But he literally talks like a robot.
[02:48:55.409 --> 02:49:00.090]  And for all the stuff you see, Musk is just rolling out what's already been around for decades.
[02:49:01.489 --> 02:49:07.629]  And neuroscience, yeah, and driverless cars, of course that's going to be used to displace humans and abuse people.
[02:49:08.049 --> 02:49:09.469]  It's got great use.
[02:49:09.670 --> 02:49:15.110]  I'm going to have to have finally surgery on my Achilles at some point.
[02:49:15.569 --> 02:49:16.909]  It's completely gone.
[02:49:18.170 --> 02:49:21.809]  Blew 70-80% of it out 10 years ago, never had the surgery, just ignored it.
[02:49:21.989 --> 02:49:22.850]  Now it's gone.
[02:49:23.469 --> 02:49:27.870]  And just as the doctors warned me years ago, once it's gone, all the rest of the stuff starts going around it.
[02:49:31.659 --> 02:49:33.659]  Especially if you're exercising a lot like I do.
[02:49:34.180 --> 02:49:35.219]  There's no pain.
[02:49:35.399 --> 02:49:36.000]  Nerve's gone.
[02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:37.739]  It's making my atrophy my calf.
[02:49:38.579 --> 02:49:41.280]  The parts that aren't still have nerves are bigger.
[02:49:42.420 --> 02:49:44.139]  The body tries to cope with it.
[02:49:45.379 --> 02:49:50.979]  But imagine, oh, seven weeks I've got to be in a calf because I didn't do it soon enough.
[02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:55.299]  It would have been like two weeks if I would have just got stapled back because it's all rotted and gone now.
[02:49:55.760 --> 02:49:56.139]  Atrophy.
[02:49:56.620 --> 02:49:57.100]  Necrosed.
[02:49:59.139 --> 02:49:59.620]  Absorbed.
[02:50:00.870 --> 02:50:03.729]  Big ball back here in my leg where the tendon's up there, but that's almost gone now.
[02:50:03.809 --> 02:50:04.809]  It's just my body's eating it.
[02:50:06.170 --> 02:50:12.190]  And it'd be great getting the car, bloop, bloop, bloop, because I can't be able to drive for a while, driving where I need to go.
[02:50:13.129 --> 02:50:18.309]  But see, it's like a calculator being a great thing, except nobody can do math anymore.
[02:50:19.229 --> 02:50:23.110]  And pretty soon you just have a respirator because it's easier to have a respirator than to breathe for yourself.
[02:50:23.329 --> 02:50:24.770]  So yeah, it's great for the blind.
[02:50:24.909 --> 02:50:25.989]  It's great for people that are paralyzed.
[02:50:25.989 --> 02:50:27.950]  It's all wonderful for my uncle.
[02:50:29.659 --> 02:50:31.459]  He doesn't have a Neuralink, he's got some other chip.
[02:50:32.459 --> 02:50:42.680]  But the point is, is that the direction by the globalist is to replace us and is to remove us.
[02:50:44.239 --> 02:50:58.239]  And so, we have to have a debate about this and we have to look at the technology and we have to make decisions culturally and regulatory about using all this to build a pro-human future.
[02:50:59.620 --> 02:51:01.579]  So everybody's trying to come out with driverless cars.
[02:51:01.780 --> 02:51:02.520]  They're all over the place.
[02:51:03.500 --> 02:51:06.040]  Everybody's trying to come out with neurosystems and chips.
[02:51:06.899 --> 02:51:08.719]  Everybody wants a big rocket program.
[02:51:09.340 --> 02:51:11.100]  Elon Musk is good at doing all of it.
[02:51:11.639 --> 02:51:15.780]  I'm not going to look at the tool and the system and just say, it's bad.
[02:51:17.969 --> 02:51:19.549]  Because I'm not anti-technology.
[02:51:20.010 --> 02:51:25.950]  But we have to have a real discussion about the way it's all being deployed and the way it's all being rolled out.
[02:51:26.110 --> 02:51:29.309]  And Elon Musk is saying AI the way it's being deployed is very dangerous.
[02:51:30.590 --> 02:51:32.309]  And he's addressing all these things.
[02:51:32.430 --> 02:51:34.069]  You're not getting that out of the other people.
[02:51:35.209 --> 02:51:39.190]  So my point is, he's the one that gets singled out for all this stuff.
[02:51:48.889 --> 02:51:53.750]  But the people like Bill Gates deploying it all saying it's a displace us and get rid of us.
[02:51:54.049 --> 02:51:56.069]  And Klaus Schwab, why is there no discussion about them?
[02:51:56.409 --> 02:51:57.389]  I mean, they're saying.
[02:51:57.549 --> 02:51:58.530]  And look, I think it's creepy.
[02:51:58.530 --> 02:52:01.350]  I don't want to come home and have a robot bring my groceries in.
[02:52:01.489 --> 02:52:03.489]  I don't want to come home and have a robot cook my dinner.
[02:52:03.629 --> 02:52:04.329]  I like to cook dinner.
[02:52:06.829 --> 02:52:09.409]  I don't want a robot to grow my garden.
[02:52:09.430 --> 02:52:10.450]  It's fun for me to do it.
[02:52:11.389 --> 02:52:12.889]  I can see an industrial scale.
[02:52:13.149 --> 02:52:13.329]  Sure.
[02:52:13.670 --> 02:52:18.819]  Have a robot with a little laser beam that goes around, you know, Frying weeds.
[02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:20.840]  And there's no pesticides.
[02:52:20.840 --> 02:52:21.920]  I don't get the pesticides.
[02:52:22.100 --> 02:52:22.719]  My family doesn't.
[02:52:22.799 --> 02:52:24.379]  There's plenty of places for robots.
[02:52:26.179 --> 02:52:30.399]  But we can't say, oh, we're not going to send humans to Mars.
[02:52:30.540 --> 02:52:31.840]  We'll send robots that's safer.
[02:52:32.020 --> 02:52:37.440]  We need to do it with humans because we need to build a human biosphere wherever we go.
[02:52:37.620 --> 02:52:40.200]  We need to build it for us, about us.
[02:52:40.340 --> 02:52:41.959]  Not just say something's better.
[02:52:42.159 --> 02:52:43.459]  Something makes us obsolete.
[02:52:43.700 --> 02:52:45.559]  Let's just go away because this can do it better.
[02:52:45.799 --> 02:52:48.139]  Can a robot really tell you how beautiful a sunset is?
[02:52:48.260 --> 02:52:51.040]  It can lie to you and say it sees as beautiful, but it doesn't.
[02:52:52.590 --> 02:52:57.409]  Does a robot have some ancient history back into antiquity of an amazing species?
[02:52:58.629 --> 02:53:00.649]  No, a robot got made by us.
[02:53:01.590 --> 02:53:03.049]  It's an extension of us.
[02:53:03.190 --> 02:53:03.950]  It works for us.
[02:53:04.110 --> 02:53:08.750]  And anybody telling us that we're obsolete and the robots are better than us is an enemy.
[02:53:09.829 --> 02:53:16.770]  And wants you to just give up your life force, give up your destiny, give up your survival instinct, and just make them the bosses.
[02:53:17.149 --> 02:53:19.690]  And those that program them and build them the bosses.
[02:53:21.190 --> 02:53:21.930]  So no.
[02:53:23.319 --> 02:53:27.420]  The police ought to be smart and use robots sparingly and drones.
[02:53:28.459 --> 02:53:31.879]  And everybody else should be because you're being replaced.
[02:53:34.260 --> 02:53:37.219]  Not because it's better, not because it's expedient.
[02:53:37.659 --> 02:53:43.239]  No, not because of any of that, because the globalists hate competition and they want a monopoly and they want to play God.
[02:53:45.440 --> 02:53:52.139]  So you read these articles, Australian Parliament banned social media for under-16s with world's first law.
[02:53:53.709 --> 02:54:10.430]  Now what they really did was, Australia the first to implement the Bill Gates UN plan for a world internet ID, which will be used to control your banking, your life, everywhere you go, and will give you absolutely no privacy, and let the system decide where you can go,
[02:54:10.569 --> 02:54:17.489]  where you can go, and it will penalize you for activities that aren't even illegal, that the ESG Global Corporate Board doesn't like.
[02:54:18.450 --> 02:54:24.729]  Headline, Australia passes the first law to create the digital mark of the beast slave monitoring system.
[02:54:28.270 --> 02:54:39.229]  See, that's your real headline from AP. You think the censorship and surveillance has been bad?
[02:54:39.569 --> 02:54:40.729]  That is...
[02:54:43.780 --> 02:54:46.139]  A 0.1 on the Richter scale.
[02:54:46.340 --> 02:54:53.940]  This thing is a 10. You get this thing in place, and yeah, Congress is talking about it, other governments are talking about it, but it's still all racing ahead.
[02:54:56.860 --> 02:55:03.360]  You're worried about the Rockefellers having a monopoly over oil in 1906 and that being busted up?
[02:55:03.500 --> 02:55:03.760]  Great.
[02:55:04.649 --> 02:55:08.909]  This is a monopoly of everything you do and total control over you.
[02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:26.969]  This is a monopoly of a control grid literally with the patents to where if you follow all their orders and jump when they say jump and carry out all the little tasks that they want you to carry out, then you'll stay in good standing with the slave masters 1 billion.0.
[02:55:34.549 --> 02:55:36.030]  So, what is the answer to this?
[02:55:36.110 --> 02:55:36.629]  It's right here.
[02:55:36.909 --> 02:55:38.090]  Recognize the control grid.
[02:55:38.229 --> 02:55:39.729]  Recognize the enforcement system.
[02:55:39.829 --> 02:55:43.209]  BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, all owned by the same people.
[02:55:43.329 --> 02:55:45.989]  80 plus percent of world assets controlled by them.
[02:55:46.649 --> 02:55:48.229]  Most of it's not their assets.
[02:55:48.469 --> 02:55:50.610]  You give it to them under management.
[02:55:51.350 --> 02:55:52.989]  Through your stock portfolio.
[02:55:53.250 --> 02:55:54.450]  Through your 401k.
[02:55:54.729 --> 02:55:56.049]  Through your mutual fund.
[02:55:56.350 --> 02:55:57.469]  Through your pension fund.
[02:55:58.579 --> 02:55:59.540]  This is the way.
[02:55:59.659 --> 02:56:04.719]  11 GOP states sue BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard for aspiring to drive up energy costs.
[02:56:06.079 --> 02:56:12.399]  AG Ken Paxton sues BlackRock, Vanguard for jacking up electric prices through investments.
[02:56:12.979 --> 02:56:16.379]  Yep, they make more money while they make it more scarce.
[02:56:18.860 --> 02:56:30.950]  And if you can cut people's energy and cost them more, they have less discretionary income, So they get more money to invest and control, and you get less money, and it's racketeering.
[02:56:31.129 --> 02:56:32.409]  It's organized crime.
[02:56:34.170 --> 02:56:38.829]  BlackRock Vanguard accused of antitrust violations by Texas and a whole bunch of other states.
[02:56:38.950 --> 02:56:41.909]  Texas sues big three asset managers over coal.
[02:56:43.309 --> 02:56:44.829]  There's no law banning coal.
[02:56:44.969 --> 02:56:45.690]  It's all regulatory.
[02:56:47.209 --> 02:56:49.110]  The Supreme Court already said that two years ago.
[02:56:49.899 --> 02:56:56.260]  Governor Newsom banning any new sales of RVs because it's cheap, good, mobile housing.
[02:56:56.940 --> 02:57:11.100]  While they jack up the prices and everything else, they, California and a bunch of other states, all together, that's all under ESG, that's all under UN, that's all under BlackRock, it's already happening all over the world, banning mobile homes, banning RVs.
[02:57:11.479 --> 02:57:15.700]  It has nothing to do with carbon and, oh, they use too much gas.
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:16.040]  No.
[02:57:17.930 --> 02:57:22.450]  Banning space heaters, banning range heaters, banning natural gas water heaters.
[02:57:22.569 --> 02:57:33.030]  It's all about cutting off the resources to you to drive you into financial ruin so you will then beg for the universal basic income.
[02:57:33.170 --> 02:57:41.989]  And under the universal basic income, they can dictate to you even more every aspect of your life, including in the Netherlands and Canada and England just passed the law today.
[02:57:44.490 --> 02:57:46.090]  Oh, you've got a hurt spine.
[02:57:46.090 --> 02:57:47.530]  You've been on welfare two years.
[02:57:47.729 --> 02:57:51.590]  We'll give you six months of welfare left, but we want you to sign an agreement to be euthanized.
[02:57:52.389 --> 02:57:53.829]  And they pressure you to do it.
[02:57:54.850 --> 02:58:00.629]  Just like, oh, just let us have gay marriage, and then boom, let us have convicted pedophiles teach your five-year-olds in school.
[02:58:02.450 --> 02:58:03.829]  It's all part of the same agenda.
[02:58:04.010 --> 02:58:06.209]  All the ESG, all funded by the big corporations.
[02:58:06.569 --> 02:58:09.690]  UK lawmakers vote in favor of a bill legalizing assisted dying.
[02:58:10.010 --> 02:58:10.610]  Fox News.
[02:58:10.989 --> 02:58:11.430]  And then boom.
[02:58:11.790 --> 02:58:12.930]  Then it's forced dying.
[02:58:16.350 --> 02:58:17.250]  You see how that works?
[02:58:18.709 --> 02:58:22.350]  Six states banned gas and diesel RV sales starting next year.
[02:58:25.750 --> 02:58:26.770]  See how it works?
[02:58:29.750 --> 02:58:31.610]  And then you got all the political correctness.
[02:58:31.930 --> 02:58:33.370]  People go, oh, it's the idiot liberals.
[02:58:33.549 --> 02:58:33.790]  Oh, yeah.
[02:58:33.950 --> 02:58:34.829]  It's the big banks.
[02:58:34.889 --> 02:58:35.790]  It's the ESGs.
[02:58:35.969 --> 02:58:36.549]  It's BlackRock.
[02:58:36.709 --> 02:58:37.069]  It's Vanguard.
[02:58:37.190 --> 02:58:37.530]  It's State Street.
[02:58:38.690 --> 02:58:45.989]  It's Larry Fink saying last year and this year, we're going to control your behavior through the ESGs, the corporations that monitor it through the internet and control.
[02:58:46.610 --> 02:58:47.909]  It's all pooled.
[02:58:50.030 --> 02:58:55.530]  And then you go into a restaurant that's a corporate chain and they charge you more because of your ESG score.
[02:58:59.629 --> 02:59:05.170]  And then the governments and the banks, they all enforce this through corporate global governance.
[02:59:05.170 --> 02:59:05.809]  Look at this example.
[02:59:07.209 --> 02:59:14.729]  Germany, man-criticized judge who fined Syrian for raping a 15-year-old girl gets fined twice as much.
[02:59:14.889 --> 02:59:17.629]  So raping a little girl gets you one fine.
[02:59:18.129 --> 02:59:20.670]  Just criticizing it gets you a bigger one.
[02:59:21.510 --> 02:59:23.670]  But not if you're a globalist leftist.
[02:59:25.170 --> 02:59:26.569]  No investigations.
[02:59:26.909 --> 02:59:31.850]  AFD must accept Peter Fisher's controversial statements.
[02:59:37.030 --> 02:59:50.709]  The president of Frankfurt, Peter Fischer, said you need to go to the houses and attack any AFD members that are simply milquetoast conservatives.
[02:59:50.989 --> 02:59:52.370]  They call for violence.
[02:59:53.049 --> 02:59:57.170]  And in Germany, you get arrested for even just criticizing the government anyway.
[02:59:57.569 --> 03:00:02.450]  But if you call for violence as a leftist leader, the government said that's okay.
[03:00:04.030 --> 03:00:04.670]  Look at this.
[03:00:04.750 --> 03:00:08.530]  The $267 million price tag of censorship efforts under Biden.
[03:00:08.549 --> 03:00:09.030]  Remember Biden?
[03:00:09.270 --> 03:00:11.250]  They told Congress there was no government censorship.
[03:00:11.569 --> 03:00:19.190]  This is just the $267 million they spent just on one censorship board that told big tech who to censor.
[03:00:22.030 --> 03:00:22.549]  Shock!
[03:00:22.729 --> 03:00:30.870]  U.S. regulatory group gives government sweeping control over U.S. tech.
[03:00:31.930 --> 03:00:35.670]  Just like the EU says they're going to go after Elon Musk and everybody else with their regulations.
[03:00:35.930 --> 03:00:47.729]  If Biden would have gotten back in or Kamala Harris, they were going to roll over and let the EU and the UK regulate and criminally charge Americans for their speech and for tech owners if they went along with it.
[03:00:47.770 --> 03:00:52.010]  Remember what the ADL said three years ago about me and Zuckerberg?
[03:00:52.110 --> 03:00:59.690]  They said, Zuckerberg will not give us full control over the speech and control, and so we want him put in prison and Alex Jones.
[03:01:03.229 --> 03:01:10.569]  G20 online speech clampdown calls set to ignite free speech fears.
[03:01:11.670 --> 03:01:15.329]  Yep, here's the G20 Rio de Janeiro leaders declaration.
[03:01:16.950 --> 03:01:20.530]  Remember they passed Agenda 21 and 92 in Rio de Janeiro.
[03:01:20.690 --> 03:01:29.309]  Well, they're back with their global declaration of total censorship and control and penalizing people through the ESG social credit score for anything you say and do.
[03:01:33.100 --> 03:01:37.180]  Human Rights Tribunal fined small Ontario town for refusing to fly gay flags.
[03:01:37.379 --> 03:01:38.399]  See, it's everything.
[03:01:39.840 --> 03:01:44.559]  Gotta fly the foreign, globalist, transhumanist flag or you get fined.
[03:01:45.340 --> 03:01:46.340]  That's in Canada.
[03:01:46.940 --> 03:01:55.620]  The hate incidents probed by police from the tweet about identifying as a fish to a boy calling another a leprechaun how cops are wasting time on ridiculous issues.
[03:01:55.760 --> 03:01:56.639]  It's not ridiculous.
[03:01:56.639 --> 03:01:58.620]  It's total tyranny all over the world.
[03:01:58.680 --> 03:01:59.639]  It's the ESG scores.
[03:01:59.680 --> 03:02:03.069]  It's the UN. Don't identify as a fish.
[03:02:04.030 --> 03:02:06.450]  There's only 127 things you're allowed to identify as.
[03:02:07.110 --> 03:02:08.370]  Don't make fun of us.
[03:02:12.209 --> 03:02:14.850]  And again, it's not just the censorship or they're being arrested.
[03:02:15.649 --> 03:02:17.709]  It's that they're surveilling you to do it.
[03:02:18.430 --> 03:02:22.209]  You see something in Germany or Ireland or England, you say, oh, that'll never happen here.
[03:02:22.389 --> 03:02:24.030]  Bull, it's the same globalist system.
[03:02:27.129 --> 03:02:27.670]  Look at this.
[03:02:27.790 --> 03:02:30.909]  Chicago teacher, union rep, says your children belong to her.
[03:02:31.030 --> 03:02:31.790]  She actually says it.
[03:02:31.889 --> 03:02:32.450]  Let's grab that clip.
[03:02:32.510 --> 03:02:33.489]  I forgot to play that the other day.
[03:02:34.729 --> 03:02:35.489]  Here it is.
[03:02:38.270 --> 03:02:43.709]  German Lutheran Church bans AFD members from committees, calls party anti-human.
[03:02:45.530 --> 03:02:49.670]  Berlin teacher sound alarm over educational crisis caused by multiculturalism.
[03:02:50.389 --> 03:02:53.409]  Only half the students can read or write or speak German.
[03:03:01.620 --> 03:03:04.680]  Alright, I'm gonna talk more about where this is going and how we stop it.
[03:03:05.399 --> 03:03:13.680]  We're always gonna look at some of the scumbag mercenaries that support this, like John Cusack.
[03:03:15.090 --> 03:03:15.670]  Stay with me.
[03:03:15.909 --> 03:03:19.229]  Many years ago, I coined the term 360 win.
[03:03:19.670 --> 03:03:22.370]  That's another way of saying it's a non-zero sum game.
[03:03:22.590 --> 03:03:27.510]  When you have a sum game, it's a pizza, there's only so many pieces, it doesn't get bigger.
[03:03:27.829 --> 03:03:33.790]  But if something is symbiotic, if something empowers everybody involved with it, it is a 360 win.

[03:04:11.129 --> 03:04:19.530]  And for breaking news and updates, be sure and follow me at Real Alex Jones here on X. All right, I'm going to say something really important here, and please listen to me.
[03:04:20.229 --> 03:04:22.829]  I know a lot of you know this, but a lot of people don't.
[03:04:23.670 --> 03:04:38.809]  Whether it's medical, whether it's financial, whether it is religious, you know, the big establishment churches, whether it is travel, whether it is transportation, Whether it's food,
[03:04:38.809 --> 03:04:49.510]  whether it's shopping, restaurants, all of it, whether you're in Japan or whether you're in Austin, Texas, or you go to the airport, they don't ask you.
[03:04:49.569 --> 03:04:50.489]  They just say face scan.
[03:04:50.709 --> 03:04:53.229]  The law says you don't have to, but people are just submitting.
[03:04:54.690 --> 03:05:03.750]  And in Europe, at Whole Foods and the other big chains, and now starting in the U.S., got a face scan to get in the building.
[03:05:04.850 --> 03:05:06.290]  You come up to turnstiles.
[03:05:07.610 --> 03:05:09.889]  Like you're at the subway, and now it wants to face-scan you.
[03:05:12.250 --> 03:05:15.530]  That's all through the BlackRock ESG corporate governance.
[03:05:16.170 --> 03:05:36.190]  I didn't even need to look it up, but I did, right when the fake pandemic started, which they admitted was training wheels for the whole casual society, and the permanent climate lockdown, just search that term, that all the major restaurants,
[03:05:37.440 --> 03:05:38.559]  Including mom and pops.
[03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:42.340]  95% of them.
[03:05:46.559 --> 03:05:47.559]  You walk in.
[03:05:49.159 --> 03:05:50.780]  After two weeks to flatten the curve.
[03:05:51.139 --> 03:05:51.840]  All that bull.
[03:05:52.799 --> 03:05:54.360]  And they say, no paper menus.
[03:05:54.799 --> 03:05:55.860]  Please QR code.
[03:05:56.219 --> 03:05:57.520]  And I'd say, I want a paper menu.
[03:05:57.680 --> 03:05:58.879]  No, the manager says we won't.
[03:05:58.979 --> 03:05:59.639]  Okay, I'm leaving.
[03:06:00.120 --> 03:06:03.280]  But I want you to know this comes out of the International Restaurant Society.
[03:06:04.569 --> 03:06:15.690]  An organization, and that it has directed this with these QR codes to get you ready for a vaccine passport and to get everybody ready to show a QR code to phone to buy and sell.
[03:06:15.889 --> 03:06:20.350]  Then they're going to, in the future, put locking doors on the front where you can't even get in places without it.
[03:06:20.489 --> 03:06:21.989]  This is the Chinese Social Credit Score.
[03:06:22.149 --> 03:06:22.729]  Sir, whatever.
[03:06:23.209 --> 03:06:24.309]  Let me talk to your manager.
[03:06:24.750 --> 03:06:26.610]  Manager comes out and says, yeah, I know, it's corporate.
[03:06:28.190 --> 03:06:31.649]  And then also the restaurant started saying, oh, we don't take cash anymore.
[03:06:33.030 --> 03:06:40.489]  And then I go home, get on the computer, international restaurant associations adopt QR codes, blah, blah, blah.
[03:06:40.709 --> 03:06:57.209]  And then boom, right out of the WF, right out of the UN, they tell them all the associations, the associations of energy, the associations of mechanics, the associations of welders, the associations of airline pilots, the associations of custodial workers.
[03:06:58.030 --> 03:07:04.360]  It's all through these societies that Who will get unlimited globalist money if they do what they're told.
[03:07:04.420 --> 03:07:05.340]  So here's a microcosm.
[03:07:06.219 --> 03:07:09.440]  With COVID. And now it's intensified.
[03:07:10.899 --> 03:07:17.639]  You go to the airport, suddenly half the restaurants rolled out right as they roll out COVID. It was already ready, set up years before.
[03:07:18.659 --> 03:07:20.840]  They kick out all the old restaurants that were successful.
[03:07:21.840 --> 03:07:26.979]  And you walk to the Austin airport and there's multiple restaurants where only it's a robot making the food.
[03:07:27.059 --> 03:07:28.860]  It's like weird, gross space food.
[03:07:29.020 --> 03:07:30.200]  Yee, yee, yee, yee.
[03:07:32.670 --> 03:07:34.450]  You can go search on the side of the place.
[03:07:34.590 --> 03:07:35.530]  Oh, bug protein.
[03:07:35.690 --> 03:07:36.790]  Funny, that's exactly what I thought.
[03:07:37.329 --> 03:07:37.850]  Oh, yeah.
[03:07:38.969 --> 03:07:41.030]  And I go to San Francisco Airport, same thing.
[03:07:41.170 --> 03:07:42.290]  D.C. Airport, same thing.
[03:07:44.649 --> 03:07:46.469]  And there's people all lined up at these things.
[03:07:46.649 --> 03:07:48.290]  Or you go up, you digitally put it in.
[03:07:48.370 --> 03:07:50.149]  There's a few workers, but sorry, I can't talk to you.
[03:07:50.209 --> 03:07:50.770]  You got to use the machine.
[03:07:51.090 --> 03:07:52.549]  Same thing at the grocery store checkout.
[03:07:52.770 --> 03:07:53.850]  Same things at Michael's.
[03:07:54.209 --> 03:07:55.049]  Art supplies.
[03:07:56.989 --> 03:07:58.049]  And it's all like that.
[03:07:59.639 --> 03:08:02.500]  And suddenly Chick-fil-A's got robots driving around delivering the food.
[03:08:04.059 --> 03:08:05.239]  And you think, oh, how cute.
[03:08:05.360 --> 03:08:10.139]  No, this is an anti-human rollout that isn't for efficiency, that isn't for humans.
[03:08:13.280 --> 03:08:15.399]  It's turning everything into a prison.
[03:08:17.340 --> 03:08:19.559]  And oh, don't worry, you don't go to the restaurant anymore.
[03:08:19.559 --> 03:08:20.799]  It just gets delivered to you.
[03:08:20.879 --> 03:08:22.520]  And it all sounds convenient on the surface.
[03:08:25.829 --> 03:08:33.629]  But it's all about making you obsolete and collapsing the human economy and training people never to work or know how to do anything for themselves.
[03:08:34.149 --> 03:08:37.489]  And then I don't even need to ever go find the documents, though I always do it.
[03:08:37.610 --> 03:08:40.170]  And then I go find the documents and it's word for word, but I already saw.
[03:08:41.670 --> 03:08:43.110]  Because it's a takeover plan.
[03:08:44.030 --> 03:08:49.729]  So you take Whataburger, famous Texas company, started in Corpus Christi in the 50s.
[03:08:51.309 --> 03:08:53.549]  Gets bought by a big Chicago globalist company.
[03:08:54.750 --> 03:08:56.729]  And they're just shutting them down all over the country.
[03:08:57.450 --> 03:08:59.049]  Digital Whataburger kitchens.
[03:08:59.049 --> 03:08:59.909]  There's one at my house.
[03:09:03.149 --> 03:09:05.590]  And you drive by it.
[03:09:06.190 --> 03:09:09.270]  There's usually no cars, maybe one car.
[03:09:09.510 --> 03:09:10.770]  People are putting it in.
[03:09:10.889 --> 03:09:11.909]  I want to go do a report on it.
[03:09:12.610 --> 03:09:14.370]  There's still humans inside.
[03:09:14.549 --> 03:09:15.510]  There's some robots too.
[03:09:16.520 --> 03:09:18.059]  And you say, well, that's not making money.
[03:09:18.180 --> 03:09:19.239]  Nobody wants to go there now.
[03:09:19.360 --> 03:09:20.100]  They don't care.
[03:09:20.180 --> 03:09:24.079]  It's for the next virus, the next lockdown, the next system.
[03:09:24.520 --> 03:09:35.500]  Because you'll only be able to spend your money at the places that are compliant, and they admit they're going to use new viruses as the training wheels for the lockdown of society, where you're literally a prisoner, like Australia tested.
[03:09:37.930 --> 03:09:49.969]  Where, oh, you can leave your house three hours a week, but you'll be arrested and spend two years in prison if you don't call the police every hour and FaceTime them to show that you are where you said you would go.
[03:09:50.530 --> 03:09:51.409]  Complying with the warden.
[03:09:51.489 --> 03:09:52.010]  You're a trustee.
[03:09:52.110 --> 03:09:53.010]  Warden, I'm here.
[03:09:55.610 --> 03:10:00.049]  It's all a Milgram prison experiment.
[03:10:00.350 --> 03:10:00.930]  Look that up.
[03:10:01.489 --> 03:10:01.889]  Psychological.
[03:10:02.110 --> 03:10:02.790]  See what you'll do.
[03:10:02.969 --> 03:10:03.870]  See what you'll jump through.
[03:10:04.030 --> 03:10:04.770]  See what you'll accept.
[03:10:05.959 --> 03:10:08.540]  And then you can go look it up and they admit it was all a psychological test.
[03:10:09.680 --> 03:10:14.579]  MI6, CIA, British Ministry of Defense, Pentagon, hundreds of headlines, years after.
[03:10:15.219 --> 03:10:18.459]  Oh yeah, COVID was all a psychological test for total control.
[03:10:24.180 --> 03:10:26.559]  Getting you used to not talking to any humans.
[03:10:26.700 --> 03:10:28.540]  Getting you used to being locked in your house.
[03:10:28.700 --> 03:10:31.659]  Getting you used to like a rat going up to a little door.
[03:10:34.940 --> 03:10:37.280]  And then what are all those people going to do without their jobs?
[03:10:38.299 --> 03:10:40.120]  Where are the entry-level jobs going to be?
[03:10:42.520 --> 03:10:44.200]  And again, this is all unnatural.
[03:10:45.639 --> 03:10:54.319]  We just keep on going the way we're going for thousands of years, getting better science, getting better technology that we adopt because we like it, because it's good.
[03:10:54.540 --> 03:10:59.940]  No, this is the forced adoption of an end to human development.
[03:11:00.079 --> 03:11:00.600]  Just a...
[03:11:02.879 --> 03:11:04.440]  Dystopia by design.
[03:11:07.360 --> 03:11:13.440]  And what do they call the dystopia?
[03:11:13.799 --> 03:11:15.559]  They call it a utopia.
[03:11:15.780 --> 03:11:22.420]  So back in the 90s, guys, look at the original utopia.
[03:11:22.520 --> 03:11:23.100]  I'm going from memory.
[03:11:24.219 --> 03:11:38.129]  The new utopia was made in 2019, went out on television in 2020, And a decade before, memory serves, they had the British version of Utopia.
[03:11:39.270 --> 03:11:41.329]  That's the exact same script.
[03:11:41.790 --> 03:11:45.770]  To the point is, this is made both of these before the COVID rollout.
[03:11:46.969 --> 03:11:51.049]  And they actually tell you exactly in the shows...
[03:11:55.950 --> 03:11:56.770]  What they're going to do.
[03:11:57.370 --> 03:12:06.649]  Utopia is an American science fiction drama television series created by Gillian Flynn based on the 2013 British original series of the same name.
[03:12:13.370 --> 03:12:28.520]  It was produced in 2019. The comic book fans discovered a global conspiracy.
[03:12:28.760 --> 03:12:42.280]  The comic book contains clues of future events because it's written by one of the architects of a plan designed to prevent ecological disaster as the Earth's population raises the resources are depleted.
[03:12:43.479 --> 03:12:46.860]  So, and they're telling you what the show is here in the plot.
[03:12:50.530 --> 03:12:56.329]  Welcome to my show!
[03:13:12.030 --> 03:13:15.549]  Announced to the public the creation of a new vaccine.
[03:13:16.010 --> 03:13:25.569]  Three, to the coordination between global elites and non-governmental organizations, ESGs, governments move quickly to inject the world's population with a new vaccine.
[03:13:25.809 --> 03:13:26.829]  That's in quotes.
[03:13:27.250 --> 03:13:28.030]  Not a vaccine.
[03:13:28.329 --> 03:13:41.870]  Four, once the population is injected, it turns out the vaccine is designed to sterilize almost all the people that take it, causing the global population to drop by 7.8 billion to about 500 million, which is the Georgia Guidestone number, and ushering in a new era of plenty.
[03:13:43.069 --> 03:13:58.389]  Now, in both the 2013 original and the 2020 remake, they grab the scientists and are mad and are interrogating him, but after he talks to them for five minutes,
[03:13:58.629 --> 03:14:01.709]  they're convinced it's right and they free him.
[03:14:02.809 --> 03:14:16.340]  So, this is like the Unabomber 10.0 and they tell you what they're going to do There's a whole bunch of shows like this too, and they tell you the show's supposed to tell you, so you're in on it.
[03:14:19.340 --> 03:14:20.739]  What do psychopaths like to do?
[03:14:20.799 --> 03:14:21.540]  They like to brag.
[03:14:23.700 --> 03:14:24.959]  Now, why is that important?
[03:14:26.360 --> 03:14:28.360]  I'll play a clip of it in a moment, the 2020 remake.
[03:14:28.920 --> 03:14:30.399]  This is John Cusack.
[03:14:32.219 --> 03:14:32.739]  All right?
[03:14:34.180 --> 03:14:38.479]  And he's a paid actor, and I would bet my bottom dollar...
[03:14:40.639 --> 03:15:02.459]  Because we're kicking the CIA, FBI's ass through their front group right now, Bloomberg, Everytown, and the whole PR thing they ran on me and raised hundreds of millions by dredging up and exaggerating and lying and saying I'm victimizing people and raising money off my name and then suing me and having HBO productions and rigged court cases where I'm already found guilty.
[03:15:03.639 --> 03:15:04.860]  And that's all coming out.
[03:15:04.920 --> 03:15:05.680]  They don't know what to do.
[03:15:06.479 --> 03:15:08.280]  And they want to attack Joe Rogan.
[03:15:10.389 --> 03:15:17.950]  And the same group's done that, threatening to sue him and stuff, if he ever has me on, or saying, well, come after you for Sandy Hook, to him.
[03:15:18.670 --> 03:15:21.969]  And they've threatened Aaron Rodgers.
[03:15:27.850 --> 03:15:33.469]  And so now he surfaces today, or last night, and attacks Joe Rogan.
[03:15:36.020 --> 03:15:38.120]  And says, Joe Rogan's a horrible person.
[03:15:38.360 --> 03:15:43.079]  He likes Alex Jones, the Sandy Hook man that was so mean to the families.
[03:15:43.079 --> 03:15:45.299]  No, I didn't do anything to those people.
[03:15:46.420 --> 03:15:50.139]  Those folks have gotten 70 plus million dollars from Remington.
[03:15:54.020 --> 03:15:56.120]  Adam Lanza, you know the guy that killed the kids?
[03:15:59.540 --> 03:16:02.860]  Adam Lanza, you know the guy that killed people.
[03:16:06.379 --> 03:16:06.940]  Not me.
[03:16:07.459 --> 03:16:09.020]  See, it's just a mind control thing.
[03:16:09.139 --> 03:16:10.579]  People associate Alex Jones, Sandy Hook.
[03:16:11.440 --> 03:16:12.440]  So I've said, yeah, I killed him.
[03:16:14.819 --> 03:16:17.180]  People are like, what?
[03:16:20.739 --> 03:16:21.739]  Well, that's what people think.
[03:16:21.840 --> 03:16:23.540]  People walk up to me and say, how dare you kill those kids?
[03:16:23.700 --> 03:16:24.520]  It's happened in front of my family.
[03:16:25.639 --> 03:16:26.799]  It's happened in front of my security guys.
[03:16:30.100 --> 03:16:31.260]  That's mind control, folks.
[03:16:32.770 --> 03:16:33.209]  That's Bloomberg.
[03:16:33.469 --> 03:16:34.930]  That's the CIA. It's all come out in court.
[03:16:35.170 --> 03:16:35.590]  Justice Department.
[03:16:35.750 --> 03:16:36.090]  All ran it.
[03:16:36.190 --> 03:16:36.389]  Public.
[03:16:36.549 --> 03:16:36.850]  Submitted.
[03:16:38.510 --> 03:16:41.370]  Run TV ads raising money.
[03:16:41.510 --> 03:16:42.950]  Oh, Alex Jones is coming after us.
[03:16:43.030 --> 03:16:43.629]  Help us.
[03:16:43.709 --> 03:16:44.569]  Send us money.
[03:16:45.770 --> 03:16:53.829]  Adam Lanza's mother buys a gun at Walmart legally that Remington made, an AR-15.
[03:16:54.309 --> 03:16:58.229]  He takes it, kills her, then goes and kills a bunch of other people.
[03:16:59.010 --> 03:17:01.469]  And then all you know 12 years later is Alex Jones.
[03:17:06.440 --> 03:17:14.479]  And then John Cusack comes out and says Joe Rogan's bad because he likes Alex Jones.
[03:17:17.059 --> 03:17:19.399]  See, it's by extension now.
[03:17:23.780 --> 03:17:27.059]  Now, why did Cusack surface right now?
[03:17:27.219 --> 03:17:28.520]  Why did he surface with his talking point?
[03:17:28.959 --> 03:17:30.299]  Well, it's a standard thing.
[03:17:32.950 --> 03:17:37.530]  And now, by extension, Joe Rogan knows Alex Jones, so he's bad too.
[03:17:37.590 --> 03:17:38.270]  He hurt kids.
[03:17:38.350 --> 03:17:39.110]  He peed on graves.
[03:17:39.290 --> 03:17:41.549]  He did all these things that never happened.
[03:17:43.450 --> 03:17:52.370]  So that's the best they can do, is tell this guy to do this, or have his agent do it, or a little something.
[03:17:57.030 --> 03:17:59.809]  Actor John Cusack attacks Alex Jones' Joe Rogan.
[03:18:00.930 --> 03:18:09.549]  Any man who stands with Alex Jones, a Sandy Hook crisis actor freak, is a total and complete fraud, says Hollywood has been.
[03:18:11.190 --> 03:18:13.129]  Numerous ex-users defend Jones.
[03:18:14.930 --> 03:18:16.170]  And boy, did they.
[03:18:18.549 --> 03:18:20.469]  John, don't be an idiot.
[03:18:20.729 --> 03:18:24.450]  They came after Jones more than they did Epstein's client list.
[03:18:25.170 --> 03:18:26.270]  Use your brain.
[03:18:26.370 --> 03:18:27.809]  Oh, I think he's using his bank account.
[03:18:29.229 --> 03:18:30.909]  John Cusack, Joe Rogan, Alex Jones.
[03:18:31.069 --> 03:18:31.209]  Hmm.
[03:18:31.670 --> 03:18:33.409]  One of these guys can't think for himself.
[03:18:33.690 --> 03:18:35.950]  Promotes liberal talking points to keep his job.
[03:18:36.129 --> 03:18:39.889]  The other two, oh, they succeeded in the new free market of ideas.
[03:18:41.489 --> 03:18:42.209]  You're wrong.
[03:18:42.350 --> 03:18:43.590]  Alex Jones is the real deal.
[03:18:45.290 --> 03:18:48.329]  I guess freedom of speech isn't worth a damn anymore.
[03:18:49.870 --> 03:18:51.690]  You are consumed with hate.
[03:18:52.209 --> 03:18:55.370]  I dare you to listen to Joe Rogan for a week before you speak about him again.
[03:18:55.370 --> 03:18:59.530]  If you can't manage that, For one three-hour show.
[03:19:00.889 --> 03:19:02.049]  It goes on from there.
[03:19:02.250 --> 03:19:04.950]  But, I mean, this is a badge of honor.
[03:19:05.770 --> 03:19:09.790]  But did I lie about WMDs in Iraq and triple the sanctions and kill millions of kids?
[03:19:10.770 --> 03:19:13.870]  You know, Iraq was pretty much a desert country.
[03:19:13.969 --> 03:19:15.129]  Most of their food was shipped in in medicine.
[03:19:15.389 --> 03:19:16.129]  No, I didn't do that.
[03:19:16.129 --> 03:19:17.770]  But I'm the bad one.
[03:19:18.110 --> 03:19:19.450]  I'm the immoral one.
[03:19:19.549 --> 03:19:21.709]  Because I did all these things I never did.
[03:19:22.399 --> 03:19:24.319]  The internet didn't believe Sandy Hook happened.
[03:19:24.459 --> 03:19:25.500]  I'd barely ever even covered it.
[03:19:25.719 --> 03:19:28.059]  Hadn't talked about it for three years when they sued me.
[03:19:31.420 --> 03:19:32.540]  It's all on record.
[03:19:34.120 --> 03:19:35.520]  But that's what they've got.
[03:19:36.180 --> 03:19:38.020]  And how'd it work out for you?
[03:19:38.540 --> 03:19:41.139]  Because you listened to Elon Musk today.
[03:19:41.520 --> 03:19:43.979]  Boy, he sure sounds like somebody I know.
[03:19:45.399 --> 03:19:48.120]  And I like him harassing Rogan.
[03:19:48.340 --> 03:19:49.959]  There's other stuff behind the scenes going on.
[03:19:50.219 --> 03:19:50.540]  Good.
[03:19:50.719 --> 03:19:51.340]  Keep that up.
[03:19:52.620 --> 03:19:54.239]  See, because you guys are jellyfish.
[03:19:54.319 --> 03:19:55.159]  You guys are coward.
[03:19:55.319 --> 03:19:56.340]  You guys are bought off.
[03:19:56.459 --> 03:19:57.360]  You guys are controlled.
[03:19:57.559 --> 03:19:58.760]  You guys are losers.
[03:19:59.100 --> 03:20:00.139]  You guys are followers.
[03:20:00.700 --> 03:20:02.879]  Just keep messing with everybody.
[03:20:03.100 --> 03:20:04.600]  Just keep harassing people.
[03:20:04.799 --> 03:20:06.219]  Just keep attacking us.
[03:20:06.280 --> 03:20:08.559]  See how it works out for you.
[03:20:10.090 --> 03:20:16.629]  You think you had a problem with me when the State Department and the government said eight years ago, numero uno enemy in the media is Alex Jones.
[03:20:16.790 --> 03:20:18.770]  Get him, get him, get him, get him.
[03:20:19.170 --> 03:20:23.729]  Do you think all these attacks made me stronger or made me weaker?
[03:20:25.629 --> 03:20:31.590]  They made me way stronger, personally and with my effect, because I am anti-globalist.
[03:20:31.690 --> 03:20:32.770]  I am anti-tyranny.
[03:20:32.930 --> 03:20:36.350]  And by the way, I want the American people, people of the world, to be the establishment.
[03:20:36.610 --> 03:20:40.850]  I want renaissance and innovation and open source freedom to be innovation.
[03:20:41.430 --> 03:20:43.549]  I really am a fan of our species.
[03:20:43.690 --> 03:20:44.950]  I really like people.
[03:20:45.090 --> 03:20:47.569]  I'm really a good, hardworking person.
[03:20:50.030 --> 03:20:53.850]  So, John Cusack, I love it.
[03:20:55.459 --> 03:20:56.459]  That's all you got?
[03:20:58.659 --> 03:21:02.420]  When people like you attack me, I know I'm doing my job.
[03:21:03.299 --> 03:21:09.379]  So here's this sick seduction piece, of course produced by the British government.
[03:21:09.879 --> 03:21:22.120]  You know MI6 produced the first incarnation, and this is the remake, produced months before the COVID rollout, perfectly on time, so they could all sit around in their cult on a power trip.
[03:21:22.159 --> 03:21:24.120]  And I wonder if Cusack's part of it.
[03:21:25.329 --> 03:21:27.629]  I wonder if he's read in on it.
[03:21:29.090 --> 03:21:30.190]  I don't know that.
[03:21:35.329 --> 03:21:37.350]  But, you know, they tried to get me to join him.
[03:21:39.850 --> 03:21:41.629]  Many times, but it was always off record.
[03:21:42.309 --> 03:21:49.549]  Except one time in front of my producer, John Harmon, Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger group, said, Dr. Kissinger really wants to meet with you.
[03:21:49.670 --> 03:21:50.450]  We want to work with you.
[03:21:50.610 --> 03:21:52.209]  You can lead the Patriots.
[03:21:53.179 --> 03:21:54.680]  And you'll have a seat at the table.
[03:21:54.840 --> 03:21:59.200]  You'll have to, you know, not make all the decisions, but this is how you'll actually have a real effect in the world.
[03:22:01.139 --> 03:22:10.000]  It must be a power trip to sit around and talk about how they're going to sterilize most of the population, and it'll have a side effect of killing a bunch of people, but that's okay because they're such big thinkers.
[03:22:10.219 --> 03:22:11.819]  You know, they know how to make all the decisions.
[03:22:15.840 --> 03:22:17.819]  Yeah, they're all too smart by half.
[03:22:18.579 --> 03:22:19.860]  Too cute by half.
[03:22:23.420 --> 03:22:24.979]  And their system's coming to an end.
[03:22:26.280 --> 03:22:28.760]  The only question is, will they kill all of us in the process?
[03:22:29.120 --> 03:22:31.159]  So John Cusack...
[03:22:31.159 --> 03:22:38.280]  You're an empty person.
[03:22:39.479 --> 03:22:41.120]  You're a biological robot.
[03:22:42.739 --> 03:22:43.979]  You're like Pinocchio.
[03:22:43.979 --> 03:22:44.860]  You're not a real boy.
[03:22:45.579 --> 03:22:46.940]  And I wish you were.
[03:22:47.139 --> 03:22:49.739]  Because the fact that fellow members of our species...
[03:22:51.719 --> 03:22:54.219]  Are against our species is disgusting.
[03:22:54.700 --> 03:22:55.360]  Here's the clip.
[03:22:57.540 --> 03:23:08.000]  Your father created a world-changing, not world-ending, a world-changing, world-improving omnivirus.
[03:23:08.780 --> 03:23:13.139]  And we have taken that virus and embedded it in the vaccine of the Stearns flu.
[03:23:13.579 --> 03:23:14.540]  I knew it.
[03:23:15.700 --> 03:23:16.579]  I knew it.
[03:23:16.719 --> 03:23:19.299]  He created a panic and now everybody's begging for the vaccine.
[03:23:19.420 --> 03:23:19.639]  No, no, no.
[03:23:20.059 --> 03:23:20.860]  Demanding it.
[03:23:21.430 --> 03:23:23.690]  With all the entitlement of a first world country.
[03:23:23.829 --> 03:23:24.149]  Yes.
[03:23:25.270 --> 03:23:27.170]  And now we have exactly what we want.
[03:23:27.450 --> 03:23:33.889]  Hundreds of millions of Americans lining up, offering us their arms, and letting us give them our creation.
[03:23:34.069 --> 03:23:38.930]  I'm pretty sure when every vaccinated person starts dying, they'll trace it back to you, undetectable virus or not.
[03:23:39.170 --> 03:23:40.270]  You've all been very busy.
[03:23:40.569 --> 03:23:41.409]  You're all very sharp.
[03:23:41.629 --> 03:23:43.389]  Are you sure none of you would like to come and work for me?
[03:23:44.430 --> 03:23:44.870]  No?
[03:23:46.049 --> 03:23:47.270]  Then understand this.
[03:23:48.819 --> 03:23:52.120]  What we are doing is far bigger than death.
[03:23:52.520 --> 03:23:52.979]  Wait.
[03:23:53.520 --> 03:23:55.700]  This virus is not deadly.
[03:23:55.959 --> 03:23:57.520]  It looks pretty damn deadly.
[03:23:59.239 --> 03:24:00.399]  Tell me this.
[03:24:02.280 --> 03:24:06.600]  What have you done today to earn your place in this crowded world?
[03:24:09.940 --> 03:24:10.620]  Exactly.
[03:24:11.600 --> 03:24:15.739]  Everything I do is a cure for our current situation.
[03:24:27.670 --> 03:24:29.809]  And how's it a cure if you're killing people?
[03:24:29.969 --> 03:24:31.590]  I told you it does not kill.
[03:24:32.149 --> 03:24:34.750]  That was the amazing epiphany we had.
[03:24:35.049 --> 03:24:37.549]  We didn't have to kill to accomplish our goal.
[03:24:44.430 --> 03:24:45.530]  Which is what?
[03:24:54.530 --> 03:24:59.270]  We intend to stop human reproduction for three generations.
[03:25:01.829 --> 03:25:07.469]  The busy, endless global assembly line of babies will grind to all.
[03:25:09.090 --> 03:25:10.829]  You're sterilizing people?
[03:25:11.450 --> 03:25:11.889]  Uh-huh.
[03:25:14.049 --> 03:25:20.170]  In the first five years, we'll start to see major birth rate declines as teenagers vaccinated today hit their childbearing years.
[03:25:23.199 --> 03:25:24.440]  Is that what they're calling it?
[03:25:24.700 --> 03:25:31.360]  It's a very nice euphemism for a species that is replicated like a contagion across the planet, killing all other species in its wake.
[03:25:31.879 --> 03:25:35.399]  Except things that are cute like puppies or koalas.
[03:25:35.760 --> 03:25:36.280]  Pandas.
[03:25:38.059 --> 03:25:42.020]  Never in history has there been a creature begging for extinction more than a fucking panda.
[03:25:43.760 --> 03:25:44.719]  Except us.
[03:25:45.600 --> 03:25:47.059]  You hate people that much?
[03:25:47.280 --> 03:25:49.020]  On the contrary, I love people.
[03:25:49.200 --> 03:25:49.639]  Then how?
[03:25:49.860 --> 03:25:50.420]  Why would...
[03:25:50.420 --> 03:25:56.020]  Doing what our government or citizenry is too spoiled or self-indulgent to do, we are saving ourselves from ourselves.
[03:25:56.420 --> 03:25:57.959]  Halting overpopulation.
[03:25:58.280 --> 03:26:02.299]  A hundred years ago, the global population was 1.7 billion.
[03:26:02.680 --> 03:26:03.219]  2011?
[03:26:03.870 --> 03:26:04.590]  It reached...
[03:26:04.590 --> 03:26:05.329]  7 billion.
[03:26:05.790 --> 03:26:10.229]  People live too long, die less often, fuck too much, shit out babies like...
[03:26:10.229 --> 03:26:11.809]  In 2050, they say it's gonna plateau.
[03:26:12.370 --> 03:26:17.309]  We'll blow past 11 billion and then slowly begin to...
[03:26:17.309 --> 03:26:17.309]  decline.
[03:26:17.629 --> 03:26:23.049]  But by then, it'll be too late to save an Earth that bears any resemblance to a world we actually wanna live in.
[03:26:38.200 --> 03:26:40.040]  So I decided to take care of the problem.
[03:26:52.319 --> 03:26:55.620]  By injecting your virus into the veins of every human on it?
[03:26:55.969 --> 03:26:59.629]  Global warming, mass extinctions, food, water shortages.
[03:26:59.989 --> 03:27:04.170]  All these problems can be boiled down to one thing, overpopulation.
[03:27:04.430 --> 03:27:05.770]  It's not as simple as that.
[03:27:05.969 --> 03:27:06.790]  But it is.
[03:27:07.090 --> 03:27:11.729]  At 1.7 billion, we can be as decadent, self-indulgent, shitty as we want.
[03:27:12.049 --> 03:27:12.690]  10 billion.
[03:27:12.870 --> 03:27:13.790]  All right, let's stop there.
[03:27:14.409 --> 03:27:15.790]  This speaks to people.
[03:27:16.749 --> 03:27:18.469]  That want to be self-appointed.
[03:27:18.790 --> 03:27:21.250]  And that's only the outer court of the secret society.
[03:27:21.430 --> 03:27:23.690]  When you get into the internal documents, some are public.
[03:27:23.829 --> 03:27:25.069]  They want all humans dead.
[03:27:25.309 --> 03:27:26.190]  Humans are bad.
[03:27:26.510 --> 03:27:29.569]  And they talk about how they're going to become this new species.
[03:27:30.250 --> 03:27:30.469]  All right.
[03:27:30.690 --> 03:27:32.989]  Owen Schroer is set to take over with the war room.
[03:27:33.829 --> 03:27:35.549]  Big war news just broke.
[03:27:35.809 --> 03:27:37.090]  I told you this was coming.
[03:27:37.389 --> 03:27:38.649]  Trump pressured him into it.
[03:27:39.670 --> 03:27:40.530]  London Telegraph.
[03:27:40.969 --> 03:27:44.069]  Zelensky, I'll give up Ukraine territory to Russia to achieve peace.
[03:27:45.090 --> 03:27:52.090]  I believe the public, and I know God gives us free will, wants people to know the truth so you can make a choice, whether you want to be slowly killed or whether you want to thrive.
[03:27:53.229 --> 03:27:54.049]  Humans are good.
[03:27:55.309 --> 03:27:56.370]  I'm on Team Humanity.
[03:27:56.750 --> 03:27:57.790]  Please join me in that.
[03:27:57.989 --> 03:28:01.729]  Take these articles, take these interviews, take this live feed, share it if you want to live.

[03:28:05.870 --> 03:28:08.049]  Big Black Friday sales are massive.
[03:28:08.229 --> 03:28:10.930]  I don't have time to get into all that now because I'm out of time.
[03:28:11.350 --> 03:28:15.389]  But huge sales right now at thealexjonesstore.com, the biggest in that site's history.
[03:28:15.870 --> 03:28:16.909]  I need your support.
[03:28:17.590 --> 03:28:18.590]  Plus, they're great products.
[03:28:18.870 --> 03:28:19.850]  I've done my job.
[03:28:19.950 --> 03:28:20.770]  Now the rest is up to you.
[03:28:20.870 --> 03:28:21.530]  Great job, crew.
[03:28:22.170 --> 03:28:23.209]  Owen Schroyer takes over.
[03:28:23.329 --> 03:28:25.170]  I'll be posting emergency reports within an hour.
[03:28:25.770 --> 03:28:33.229]  Well, the winner, Chris Delaro, is here in studio from New Jersey, former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[03:28:33.229 --> 03:28:34.329]  What an amazing aircraft.
[03:28:34.610 --> 03:28:35.989]  Chris, I gotta say, man, we love you.
[03:28:36.069 --> 03:28:36.809]  Thanks for the support.
[03:28:37.350 --> 03:28:38.329]  I love you, Alex.
[03:28:38.489 --> 03:28:40.590]  I love Bigley, Nate, Colin.
[03:28:40.850 --> 03:28:41.229]  Thanks, Chris.
[03:28:41.270 --> 03:28:46.409]  This is one of the pinnacles in my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there, just being in this studio.
[03:28:46.409 --> 03:28:47.610]  I never imagined I'd be here.
[03:28:47.610 --> 03:28:48.569]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[03:28:48.649 --> 03:28:49.250]  You're the reason we're here.
[03:28:49.549 --> 03:28:51.809]  It's so cool how cool the listeners are.
[03:28:51.889 --> 03:28:52.290]  It is.
[03:28:52.649 --> 03:28:52.770]  Yes.
[03:28:52.969 --> 03:28:53.469]  Oh, thank you.
[03:28:53.700 --> 03:28:54.780]  The listeners are amazing.
[03:28:55.020 --> 03:29:00.760]  Like, everyone that goes to the Alex Jones store, obviously you're in it to win this truck, but this experience of coming on the show, how is this, Chris?
[03:29:00.940 --> 03:29:04.620]  I mean, is this not, this is like a, it's a dream, I would feel like, for the winner, right?
[03:29:04.819 --> 03:29:16.059]  Fortunately, I slept pretty good last night, but it's been very stressful because he said, Colin said, you're going on the show, and I was like, I'm a little camera shy, but here I am.
[03:29:16.180 --> 03:29:17.360]  And I've done well, Lord Vader.
[03:29:18.360 --> 03:29:20.719]  I said, I'll do whatever I need to do to help Alex and Big Lee.
[03:29:20.920 --> 03:29:22.559]  Well, I'm glad I got to meet you.
[03:29:22.600 --> 03:29:24.399]  We're going to eat some barbecue from Terry Black's here in a minute.
[03:29:24.719 --> 03:29:26.120]  Am I starting to mouthwater when you said that?
[03:29:26.260 --> 03:29:26.739]  No, I'm starving.
[03:29:26.860 --> 03:29:30.860]  Now, real quick, this is all done by a computer, by a professional company.
[03:29:31.079 --> 03:29:32.200]  I was talking to you guys before.
[03:29:32.760 --> 03:29:34.100]  Sometimes it's in the middle of it.
[03:29:34.139 --> 03:29:34.940]  Sometimes it's at the end.
[03:29:35.020 --> 03:29:35.940]  Sometimes it's at the start.
[03:29:36.700 --> 03:29:39.139]  Have you seen where somebody who entered on the first day won?
[03:29:39.809 --> 03:29:45.129]  Honestly, we've done probably 30 of these giveaways and have never seen someone win on the very first day.
[03:29:45.329 --> 03:29:50.950]  But we have these multipliers that go into place maybe at the first week and the last week of the giveaway, right?
[03:29:51.090 --> 03:29:54.270]  And during these multipliers, if you spend $10, you get 100 entries.
[03:29:54.290 --> 03:29:56.370]  If you spend $100, you get 1,000 entries, right?
[03:29:56.530 --> 03:29:59.030]  It's a 10x multiplier for when you enter during that time period.
[03:29:59.190 --> 03:30:01.889]  You actually entered during the 10x time period, right?
[03:30:02.170 --> 03:30:04.870]  And at the end of the giveaway, we run the 10x time period as well.
[03:30:04.909 --> 03:30:07.409]  So it was one of the best times to enter to win.
[03:30:07.649 --> 03:30:10.469]  And I mean, you got, you know, more entries for how much you spent.
[03:30:10.489 --> 03:30:11.989]  With the new contest, where are we right now?
[03:30:12.110 --> 03:30:15.409]  It's a brand new Ford F-250 Super Duty trimmer.
[03:30:15.569 --> 03:30:16.030]  It's sick.
[03:30:16.129 --> 03:30:17.389]  It's all black, jacked up.
[03:30:17.549 --> 03:30:19.370]  It's Alex Jones verified for sure.
[03:30:19.590 --> 03:30:20.610]  He picked the wheels.
[03:30:20.729 --> 03:30:21.469]  He picked the tires.
[03:30:21.709 --> 03:30:22.469]  It looks good.
[03:30:22.549 --> 03:30:22.870]  I don't know.
[03:30:22.969 --> 03:30:23.969]  Yeah, we're showing it right here.
[03:30:24.370 --> 03:30:26.889]  It also comes with $10,000 in cash as well.
[03:30:26.950 --> 03:30:27.889]  Chris, do you have that on you?
[03:30:28.049 --> 03:30:29.629]  Yeah, this is not a hoax, people.
[03:30:42.829 --> 03:30:43.790]  Somebody can be like Chris.
[03:30:43.909 --> 03:30:45.450]  They can go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:30:45.530 --> 03:30:48.750]  They can order the great CMOS, order any of the great supplements, t-shirts, hats, whatever.
[03:30:48.889 --> 03:30:54.889]  And you're entered to win a badass, brand new F-250 trimmer, fully loaded pickup truck.
[03:30:54.930 --> 03:30:56.270]  And you get $10,000 in cash.
[03:30:56.350 --> 03:30:57.530]  And we fly you down here.
[03:30:57.649 --> 03:30:58.510]  You get to meet Alex.
[03:30:58.610 --> 03:30:59.290]  You get to be on the show.
[03:30:59.430 --> 03:31:01.790]  If you just enter your email, you're still entered to win.
[03:31:01.989 --> 03:31:03.750]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:31:03.889 --> 03:31:04.530]  Enter your email.
[03:31:04.709 --> 03:31:05.870]  Join the VIP club.
[03:31:06.090 --> 03:31:09.229]  I promise you next week what you'll get for being in the VIP club.
[03:31:09.489 --> 03:31:10.510]  You'll be very excited.
[03:31:10.690 --> 03:31:15.090]  I knew folks would love the last truck, and I know you'll love this truck as well.
[03:31:15.290 --> 03:31:20.969]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[03:31:21.149 --> 03:31:26.649]  It's a beautiful truck, super high ratings, and you get $10,000 in cash on top of it.
[03:31:26.819 --> 03:31:42.739]  For the lucky winner, a 2024 Ford F-250 Super Duty Diesel Tremor Edition, 6.7 liter high output power stroke diesel engine with 500 horsepower and 1,200 pound-feet per torque, 2-inch ready lift kit,
[03:31:43.100 --> 03:31:51.959]  37-inch Toyo off-road tires, 20-inch black Rhino wheels, 12-inch touchscreen with 360-degree cameras to see all around the truck.
[03:31:52.579 --> 03:31:53.879]  Well, it's a kick-ass truck.
[03:31:54.059 --> 03:31:56.280]  I'm sorry to see it go, but it's going to a great guy, Chris.
[03:31:56.420 --> 03:31:57.620]  Chris, love you, brother.
[03:31:57.840 --> 03:31:58.379]  Love you, man.
[03:31:58.459 --> 03:31:58.739]  Thank you.
[03:31:59.100 --> 03:32:01.139]  Somebody's about to get this sweetheart right here.
[03:32:01.600 --> 03:32:04.600]  And listen, they said I could drive it while I was down here for the last month and a half.
[03:32:04.760 --> 03:32:05.559]  I only drove it once.
[03:32:05.899 --> 03:32:06.879]  Things are too nice.
[03:32:07.159 --> 03:32:09.079]  The winners are going to get these pristine trucks.
[03:32:09.500 --> 03:32:11.840]  So, we'll see you at thealkshowstore.com, and thanks for all your support.
