[00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.489]  It's Wednesday, December 4th, 2024. About to lay out intel that can stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:28.769]  If not, it's civil war.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.759]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.960]  46 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, 19 seconds.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.149]  President Trump is Inaugurated the 47th President of the United States of America.
[00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.450]  It is Wednesday, December 4th, 2024. This is an emergency Wednesday broadcast.
[00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.689]  I have discovered how the globalists are planning to stage a coup against the incoming Trump administration and plunge America into civil war.
[00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.429]  This is an absolute must-watch-share transmission.
[00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.950]  Now, look, I have incredible news.
[00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:09.849]  All of it's very important, and I will get to all of it here today.
[00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:23.450]  But, sitting here in the last few hours, getting ready and researching, I thought, what is the most important thing for me to cover?
[00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.209]  First, first and foremost, I'm on one of these shows that, you know, we'll wait until the second or third hour of the most important things coming in.
[00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:32.129]  It's all important.
[00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:35.909]  But, I want to explain something to people.
[00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.370]  And I know most of you know this.
[00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.230]  I am trying to affect the future.
[00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.349]  I'm trying to stop the bad guys.
[00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.430]  I want to stop this plan they've got.
[00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.810]  I don't want it to happen.
[00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.829]  And then everyone's completely amazed.
[00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:50.469]  Oh my God, Alex Jones is so smart.
[00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:52.189]  I'm not smart.
[00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.909]  All right?
[00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.349]  I mean, I'm not stupid, but what I'm saying is you don't need to be super smart to understand this.
[00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.109]  It's very frustrating.
[00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.390]  They are 100% not even telegraphing.
[00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:07.290]  Not even foreshadowing.
[00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.849]  They are everywhere continually.
[00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.169]  And you've been hearing this from me for over a year.
[00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.150]  And I mean, that was over the horizon.
[00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:19.590]  Hundreds of times, explain.
[00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:28.270]  Once he's president-elect, if we're able to override the fraud, which we did, they will accelerate war with Russia.
[00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.050]  That happened.
[00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.469]  That was an absolute no-brainer.
[00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.949]  I said, they'll start hitting them with attack comes and storm shadows.
[00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.490]  They did that.
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.199]  And I said they'll also try to pull the rug out from the economy, which they're doing, and I've got that today.
[00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:43.500]  But I also said the pre-programming is not clear.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.539]  It's 100% crystal.
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:03:08.419]  So it's not my opinion that they are everywhere and they're intensifying it out of the blue with no evidence saying white supremacist armies Are going to blow up the power grid, working with Trump and the Russians, and the FBI leads mentally ill people and then busts them in the process to create the illusion that's real,
[00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:22.199]  literally synthetic, completely manufactured, and they're going to kill migrants en masse once Tom Homan goes out and starts arresting the illegal alien smugglers and the rest of them.
[00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:28.659]  And I told you you'd see the mayors and people say we're going to physically resist them and they're going to try to get civil unrest going.
[00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.699]  So if you're a regular listener, you're like, we already know this.
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.740]  We've heard this a hundred times.
[00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.240]  Well, we're not just here to know interesting information.
[00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.300]  We're here as Paul Revere's.
[00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:47.400]  That means you, the resistance, the populace, the American people and others around the world.
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.539]  Everybody's affected by this.
[00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.250]  As goes America, so goes the world.
[00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:04.610]  That they are 100% planning mass attacks, mass shootings, bombings of illegal aliens as soon as Trump gets in.
[00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.370]  They are 100% going to hit the power grid and blame Trump supporters.
[00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:10.550]  They're already doing it.
[00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.910]  They are 100% going to blow up a big black church or a...
[00:04:20.369 --> 00:04:21.209]  Black college.
[00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:26.029]  And then they're going to have unrest burning down half the country.
[00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.509]  And then when Trump tries to stop it, that's when they're going to kill him.
[00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:39.490]  And then they're going to just trigger an ongoing civil war as the smokescreen for the political persecution and the shift of America to total totalitarianism.
[00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:40.649]  Here's the good news, though.
[00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:41.389]  We've got their plan.
[00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:42.170]  We're going to stop it.
[00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.350]  If you raise the alarm, it's up to you.
[00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:45.829]  Do you want to stop tyranny?
[00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:56.089]  Well, so do I. Alright, we have an extremely important mega-packed transmission today.
[00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.990]  Special guests, you name it.
[00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.250]  There is so much going on.
[00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:11.810]  And I'm going to mention here some of what we're going to be covering today, and then I'm going to plunge into what is, first and foremost, the most important issue.
[00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:15.490]  Do you want to stop the new world order?
[00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.009]  Do you want to secure the Trump victory?
[00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.269]  Do you want to turn the country and the planet around?
[00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.250]  Do you want to have a prosperous, secure, empowered future?
[00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.449]  I sure as hell do.
[00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:37.350]  Well, as Edmund Burke once said, and as Thomas Jefferson said, they all basically said the same quote.
[00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.829]  It's true.
[00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:42.110]  All that evil needs to succeed is that good men do nothing.
[00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.610]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is good men do nothing.
[00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.250]  And so the average good man just wants to go work and go play golf and be with his family and go to church.
[00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.350]  He thinks that's being a good man because he's not robbing banks.
[00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:58.209]  Yeah, okay.
[00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.829]  You're a good person.
[00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.970]  But you're sure as hell not out on the field of...
[00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:07.329]  Life.
[00:06:07.329 --> 00:06:11.430]  Understanding that there are a lot of evil people that want power and control.
[00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:15.990]  And just because you don't want power and control doesn't mean they don't.
[00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:29.949]  And so when you don't try to have power and control, the power and control to have checks and balances and liberty, that creates a vacuum and nature abhors a vacuum.
[00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.389]  And like water to the sea, rivers to the sea, you will get tyranny.
[00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.370]  So, I am stating something that is as clear as the nose on my face or your face.
[00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.829]  Or this blue shirt I'm wearing.
[00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.709]  Or this black microphone in front of me.
[00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.730]  And this is 100% going on.
[00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.850]  This is 100% happening.
[00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:56.889]  And I see zero...
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:14.920]  Response from the incoming Trump administration and zero from Trump and zero from Don Jr. and zero from his immediate circle.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.959]  And I'm not mad at them.
[00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:16.879]  I care about them.
[00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:17.800]  I love them.
[00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:24.699]  But you have to get ahead of this.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:35.250]  We still hear nothing from From Trump on the accelerated World War III. And that's their other big attack.
[00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.370]  And it's confirmed behind the scenes trying to get peace deals and the rest of it.
[00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:41.449]  Well, you get that by using your bully pulpit.
[00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.750]  That's a major mistake, 100%.
[00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:52.850]  And so we need to put pressure publicly, all of us, and on the telephone, those of us that have connections, and say, what's going on?
[00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.730]  So, I belabored that the last few weeks.
[00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:58.990]  I'm not going to really get into that now.
[00:07:59.129 --> 00:07:59.990]  It's been covered.
[00:08:00.829 --> 00:08:02.529]  If you don't know about it, you've been hiding under a rock.
[00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.269]  You missed any of the shows last week.
[00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.750]  I hit it at the start of every show.
[00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:07.910]  So, I'm not going back there.
[00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.449]  So, Putin's publicly, hey, let's do a peace deal.
[00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.069]  Come on, let's go.
[00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.149]  They're going to try to kill you, Trump.
[00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:19.290]  They're going to try to accelerate the war before you get in.
[00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.029]  We need to do this.
[00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:21.129]  That's smart.
[00:08:27.459 --> 00:08:30.339]  No, what I'm talking about is the other track they've got.
[00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:39.179]  And within that track is some really nasty stuff, and I'm going to expose that.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.320]  And again, for regular listeners, you're like, we already know what you're about to say.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:54.539]  Well, okay, we're not here to just entertain people, because I got plenty of robberies and murders and crazy leftists that are hilarious, and we can laugh at the left all day.
[00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.169]  It's like laughing at gangrene on your leg.
[00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.769]  It's rotting the country and the world.
[00:09:00.169 --> 00:09:02.710]  And sure, I like that stuff as much as the next person.
[00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:15.929]  Except, obsessing over the Hunter Biden pardon, which you knew was coming, or obsessing over the Secretary of Defense nomination, all of that is a diversion.
[00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.809]  That's little potatoes.
[00:09:20.669 --> 00:09:21.529]  Small potatoes.
[00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:24.870]  I'm talking about not just the steak on the plate.
[00:09:25.009 --> 00:09:26.370]  I'm talking about the whole cow here.
[00:09:26.529 --> 00:09:26.889]  Okay?
[00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:34.269]  It's accelerating World War III and it is triggering mass civil unrest.
[00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:48.450]  Build a civil war and having the military and that means the globalist commanders stage a coup against Trump.
[00:09:48.690 --> 00:10:00.299]  The Democrats are When I said the Trump incoming administration is crickets, the Democrats are like a giant symphony of drums banging.
[00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:02.639]  War drums.
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.559]  People go, oh, they're pathetic.
[00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:05.580]  They'll never get away with that.
[00:10:05.759 --> 00:10:07.720]  Okay, I hope you're right.
[00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:11.600]  They sure as hell won't if we start spotlighting it.
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:39.740]  But if they're running around everywhere, and they said this four years ago, if Trump could have overridden the fraud, that they were going to have the Democrats, states, and cities secede and order their police and the local public to rise up against the Trump administration and federal agents,
[00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:44.929]  And sabotage the country.
[00:10:45.169 --> 00:10:46.190]  And they're now back.
[00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:51.389]  Everything they're saying is the public Podesta plan from four years ago in the New York Times.
[00:10:53.029 --> 00:11:00.490]  And they said in the big war game plans, that the Democrats had their war games, and they said, well, we're going to call it a red mirage, and we'll have the ballots we need.
[00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:02.029]  We think that'll override him.
[00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:03.529]  They were just saying they were going to steal it.
[00:11:04.149 --> 00:11:06.509]  The 2,000 mules, it's all there.
[00:11:09.809 --> 00:11:12.250]  And so they said, if we can steal it, we're going to do this.
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:20.539]  And then we're going to prosecute all his people and come after him and lawfare everybody and try to destroy the liberty movement and target his supporters.
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:35.039]  But if we can't steal it, as the shadow government openly said, yeah, we're the shadow government and here's how we stop Trump in 2020. I mean, they bragged about it all over the news.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.279]  But if we can't do that, here's what we're going to do.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.759]  We're going to have all these blue sectors secede.
[00:11:43.429 --> 00:11:51.789]  And then we're going to have uprisings and we're going to have our own inauguration of Biden to legitimize it to their idiot supporters in the cult.
[00:11:53.450 --> 00:12:10.070]  And then when the feds come in and Trump tries to stop the illegal communist globalist rebellion, we're going to say he's a dictator and the Pentagon will move against him.
[00:12:11.929 --> 00:12:14.690]  Now they've introduced the legislation in the Senate.
[00:12:14.889 --> 00:12:16.169]  Now they're all over the news.
[00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:23.870]  And I'll go over it in a moment, saying he's going to use the military to attack the people.
[00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:25.029]  He's going to kill the migrants.
[00:12:25.029 --> 00:12:26.870]  He's going to kill the black people with no evidence.
[00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.669]  His supporters working with Putin are going to knock out the electrical grid.
[00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:40.529]  And we keep catching the feds literally running mentally ill people they recruit online who think they're in some type of Nordic cult.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.360]  And then they're commanded to go out and try to blow up power stations.
[00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:51.419]  Every week they're busting another group to create the chatter and say, see, we stopped all these, but oh, we couldn't stop the big one.
[00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:58.679]  And they've pre-programmed that the cyber attack will make COVID look like a minor inconvenience.
[00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:09.039]  And so Putin with Trump, with the white supremacist, knocks the power out in different areas.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.879]  The left's uprising.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:19.960]  There's a mass attack on a migrant demonstration in Denver or New York or wherever, Chicago.
[00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:22.940]  Somebody shoots a couple hundred people.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.059]  They find the patsy.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.320]  He's dead, though.
[00:13:26.419 --> 00:13:27.340]  He's a Trump supporter.
[00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:31.120]  He gets off five magazines into the crowd of men, women, children.
[00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:35.970]  Little two-year-old Paco gets shot in the face.
[00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.210]  You see his face everywhere.
[00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:55.149]  And the Pentagon, two days after Trump won the election, put out publicly that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and the other military leadership...
[00:13:57.019 --> 00:14:03.440]  The civilian and military leadership of the Pentagon were meeting on how to stop Trump giving illegal orders and martial law.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:14.080]  See, they're going to provide the crises, and then when Trump gives the orders, then they have the military coup.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:23.210]  And you've seen the movie Civil War, where the military comes and the Secret Service Doesn't desert the president.
[00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:25.429]  Well, the military just kills them too.
[00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.649]  So they've all scripted it.
[00:14:27.789 --> 00:14:29.250]  It's all right there.
[00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:48.009]  And so many people are following the diversions of the Biden pardon and the Secretary of Defense nomination and all that.
[00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:51.889]  Instead of, what are the bad guys doing?
[00:14:52.029 --> 00:14:53.049]  What are the bad guys saying?
[00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:53.889]  What are they up to?
[00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.370]  What have they been battle planning forever?
[00:14:55.769 --> 00:15:00.330]  So, their plan in 2020 was publicly.
[00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.210]  John Podesta interviewed, yeah, we war game.
[00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:04.230]  We're going to secede.
[00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.809]  We're going to form uprisings.
[00:15:07.149 --> 00:15:12.029]  And then now they're saying it again because Trump won and they're going with the damn plan.
[00:15:12.289 --> 00:15:18.129]  I mean, and then I have to put a headline out, Alex Jones has discovered the plan.
[00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:28.029]  Because it's like if I got on an airplane and flew to Washington, D.C. and drove down by the White House and said, look, I've discovered the Washington Monument.
[00:15:28.409 --> 00:15:35.570]  Or if I went to southern, south Manhattan and looked out at the water and said, there's Staten Island.
[00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.169]  I've discovered the Statue of Liberty.
[00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.110]  This is so ridiculous.
[00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:51.429]  Because when we live in tyranny, and it sounds outrageous, and they're saying it and doing it and preparing it, it just doesn't sound normal to say they're planning this.
[00:15:51.549 --> 00:15:54.789]  And so the Republicans are like, Mr. President, don't address this.
[00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:55.570]  Don't talk about it.
[00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.509]  It's not going to happen.
[00:15:57.669 --> 00:15:58.190]  They're crazy.
[00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:02.029]  Well, you wait until they cut the power off in half the country.
[00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.009]  You wait until they mow down a couple hundred migrants.
[00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.450]  You wait until they truck bomb a black college.
[00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:09.970]  You just wait!
[00:16:13.129 --> 00:16:14.610]  And that's why they want me off the air.
[00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:20.230]  And I've had the Justice Department twice in the last six months try to close the doors here illegally.
[00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:30.570]  And because I will come out and say what they're up to.
[00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:51.009]  And I've got Tens of millions of wonderful people like you listening, and if you decide I'm right, which it's not even deciding, it's right there, and then you decide to share the live link from real Alex Jones right now, and you decide to grab the clips yourself and upload them elsewhere,
[00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:58.009]  and you decide to hit your whole email list and your whole text message list and go around and say, this is important, this is important, this guy's been right a lot.
[00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.769]  Look, you don't have to believe him, they're saying they're going to do it.
[00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:12.359]  They're not running around on ABC News and NBC and CNN and MSNBC and the New York Times, the Washington Post, everywhere else, saying Trump's gonna kill the migrants.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.940]  Trump's gonna kill the black people.
[00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:17.640]  He's got armies of white supremacists training in the woods, coming to kill everyone.
[00:17:18.279 --> 00:17:22.440]  As Pelosi and Maxine Waters, you've heard them all.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.880]  Oh, Trump's got people traded in the woods coming to kill us.
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:37.660]  You mean feds are running bases where they psychologically troll and find mentally ill people and literally homeless people, like in the Whitmer kidnapping synthetic case.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:43.299]  Think of the Whitmer kidnapping times 100. And that's just the detonator.
[00:17:44.539 --> 00:17:55.440]  Whack jobs controlled by these people going out and mowing down a bunch of illegal aliens and protesters that are protesting Trump the Nazi.
[00:17:56.079 --> 00:17:59.039]  And then the final piece is, oh look, he is a Nazi.
[00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:04.700]  I mean, look all the hay they made out of Charlottesville and false quoted Trump on that.
[00:18:13.079 --> 00:18:22.119]  You imagine 100, 200 dead Democrat illegal alien protesters, and you imagine what that's going to look like.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.720]  So you want to know what they're going to do?
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.920]  I told you, I said within weeks of him getting elected, they're going to start bombing Russia with attackums and storm shadows.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.079]  I'm on record like a broken record.
[00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:39.910]  And now I'm telling you they are saying they are going to do this.
[00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.569]  They're not saying they're going to attack the illegal aliens themselves.
[00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.990]  But that's the last little piece.
[00:18:46.809 --> 00:18:50.130]  They're not saying the feds are going to blow up the power stations.
[00:18:50.349 --> 00:18:51.109]  They are just...
[00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.750]  Saying, oh God, all these Trump supporters are out there.
[00:18:54.869 --> 00:18:55.329]  They're going to do it.
[00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.609]  An FBI emergency bulletin was last year and this year.
[00:18:59.009 --> 00:19:02.410]  Oh, Putin working with Trump is going to cut the power off.
[00:19:02.509 --> 00:19:03.529]  Hmm, sure he is.
[00:19:05.009 --> 00:19:09.029]  The Democrats turning off the pipelines and literally turning the power off.
[00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:13.210]  So I'm going to talk about this for a while.
[00:19:14.009 --> 00:19:15.609]  And then I'm going to get into all the other news.
[00:19:15.609 --> 00:19:16.410]  It's very important.
[00:19:17.569 --> 00:19:17.970]  But...
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:27.539]  It really frustrates me to know the enemy plans that a blind person could understand.
[00:19:30.079 --> 00:19:43.299]  And to sit here and just watch this thing, this runaway train coming towards us, And we're not even tied down on the tracks.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.299]  We just have to recognize there's a train a mile away going 100 miles an hour.
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.240]  It's going to be here soon.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.819]  We need to get off the railroad tracks.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.940]  I'm like, you hear it?
[00:19:51.599 --> 00:19:52.200]  It's coming out.
[00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:53.259]  That's a train right there.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.420]  We're just like having a picnic on the train tracks.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.859]  Oh, come on.
[00:19:58.819 --> 00:20:00.299]  Don't want to sound alarmist, do you?
[00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:02.839]  So I'm here raising the alarm.
[00:20:04.339 --> 00:20:06.220]  That's why the deep state does not like me.
[00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:27.509]  And we just continue to sleepwalk into nuclear war, economic collapse, civil unrest leading into a national emergency, and they can still kill Trump now.
[00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:29.609]  They can still blow up his plane with a surface-air missile now.
[00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:30.890]  Believe me, they're trying.
[00:20:31.089 --> 00:20:32.390]  They can still poison Trump now.
[00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:34.690]  But...
[00:20:37.049 --> 00:20:42.390]  Then he becomes a martyr, and you get J.D. Vance, and they're still going to try.
[00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.630]  But I don't think they'll succeed.
[00:20:44.849 --> 00:21:03.369]  But their backup plan that is now their main plan is hand Trump a giant out-of-control war and trigger a civil war.
[00:21:07.509 --> 00:21:14.990]  And then you've got the last four years, thousands of food processing facilities blown up and other infrastructure.
[00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:16.809]  And of course, it's globalists.
[00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:17.670]  They're operatives.
[00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:23.210]  Because they didn't just want really bad inflation because of their monetary policies.
[00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:24.930]  They wanted inflation on you.
[00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:26.829]  They wanted your food prices up.
[00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:30.170]  Why do you think there's shortages of food and different things you like to eat?
[00:21:30.349 --> 00:21:31.329]  Why do you think...
[00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:33.549]  Prices are so high.
[00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.130]  It's not just the monetary issues.
[00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.309]  It's the processing of food.
[00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.369]  What did Kerry say last year and this year?
[00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.650]  We've got to cut half the farming in the world or people are going to starve.
[00:21:43.809 --> 00:21:44.410]  And you're like, what?
[00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:53.430]  We've got to tie bowling balls to our feet and jump into the Atlantic Ocean in 1,000-foot water or we're going to drown?
[00:21:55.130 --> 00:22:01.829]  That's oxymoronic, but they're cutting off the food and farming all over the world.
[00:22:03.019 --> 00:22:07.500]  Then, when food prices go up, to a certain point, it always triggers civil unrest.
[00:22:08.099 --> 00:22:11.839]  Klaus Schwab says, an angrier world will bring in the new world order.
[00:22:12.099 --> 00:22:13.779]  The angrier world.
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.980]  Cloward and Piven on a mass scale.
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.380]  Primed and ready.
[00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:30.299]  And now the Democrats and the globalists in other countries like the UK, Keir Starmer, Suddenly pivot and go, oh, we're against the illegals.
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.099]  We want to deport them.
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.079]  You're right, it's terrible.
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.579]  And then they cut off the benefits to them.
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:53.460]  So then when the civil unrest hits, so the 25 million illegal aliens and the 60, 70, 80 million people on food stamps, and even they get the food stamps that won't buy enough food, and now in the actuaries, in the numbers, anywhere in the world when the average person's income,
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:23:02.950]  whether it's welfare or your paycheck, When you start spending 50% on food and energy, you get mass crime and civil unrest.
[00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.829]  You go up to 60, you get total revolution.
[00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:11.230]  And they're going to be there providing to all the pissed off people.
[00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.390]  The reason you're pissed off is Trump.
[00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:21.950]  His people just killed 167 innocent migrants and other American citizens protesting the Nazi policies of Trump.
[00:23:22.109 --> 00:23:24.769]  And a group of Nazis just killed them.
[00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:26.809]  It's Trump.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.680]  And then they burn down the country.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.039]  And then the military at the top blows up Trump's airplane.
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.900]  And then they just roll through with the Civil War.
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:48.220]  And they take all the Patriots Bank accounts and they start having you go to truth and reconciliation commissions and denouncing your neighbors and people.
[00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:55.769]  And then once you hit that point, you are in a totalitarian nightmare hellscape extravaganza.
[00:23:56.309 --> 00:23:57.890]  Then they release a new virus.
[00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.710]  Then they roll out a new poison shot.
[00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:05.569]  Then their cult members are everywhere, wearing their mask, denouncing anyone that doesn't submit.
[00:24:07.009 --> 00:24:17.930]  And the globalists don't care if governors fight back or legislators get together because the chaos will be so horrible and the electricity won't be on most of the time.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.359]  That they'll just let us run around and burn ourselves out for a couple years.
[00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:23.940]  That's the plan.
[00:24:24.119 --> 00:24:25.819]  End of America right now.
[00:24:26.539 --> 00:24:29.359]  Yeah, Trump on the ballot was about saving America.
[00:24:29.779 --> 00:24:32.579]  The globalists had a plan to fully capture it and take control of it.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.920]  And if they're going to lose control, they're not going to go with their slow collapse plan.
[00:24:37.079 --> 00:24:39.240]  They're going to go with the fast collapse plan.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.779]  They're willing to have a nuclear war to stay in power.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.799]  You think they'll collapse this country?
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.380]  You better bet your bottom Benjamin they will.
[00:24:53.019 --> 00:25:14.059]  So, we need Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan and Elon Musk and Donald Trump and Vivek Ramaswani and J.D. Vance and every other smart person that has access to large audiences to raise the alarm.
[00:25:14.259 --> 00:25:18.220]  But whether they do it or not, I'm going to do it.
[00:25:18.859 --> 00:25:21.880]  And I know you're going to do it.
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:30.240]  And not because we're heroes, not because we like risking our lives, but because it's the default.
[00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:39.119]  You'd have to be the most psychotically courageous, nihilistic person to not want to stop this.
[00:25:39.259 --> 00:25:40.880]  And I know it's scary to be facing it.
[00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:44.799]  Let me tell you what's a lot scarier, my sweethearts.
[00:25:46.599 --> 00:25:48.079]  Letting them pull this off.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.779]  This is about self-preservation.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.240]  I'm not doing any of this.
[00:25:54.509 --> 00:25:57.509]  Because I'm a savior or I'm so smart.
[00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:02.369]  We have to get in the mindset of it is the default to be informed.
[00:26:02.589 --> 00:26:04.869]  It is the default to not be an idiot.
[00:26:05.069 --> 00:26:07.529]  It is the default to be engaged and vocal.
[00:26:07.809 --> 00:26:11.990]  It is the default when you're under attack and there's nowhere to run.
[00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:15.150]  We're cornered.
[00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:32.210]  And we're more powerful than them if we simply decide to be hardcore and be honest with ourselves and everyone else and admit the bad position the world's in because of these people and that they're the ones that have got to be removed and they're the ones planning all this.
[00:26:32.509 --> 00:26:39.369]  You think if Elon Musk and Donald Trump start talking about this obvious plan that they're all admitting to?
[00:26:40.539 --> 00:26:44.240]  They admit to all of it, but the false flags are going to stage that are the trigger.
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:44.839]  That's it.
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.019]  All of it's admitted.
[00:26:46.299 --> 00:26:46.960]  All of it's set up.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:47.819]  All of it's rolling.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.980]  All of it's in function.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.339]  All of it is in action.
[00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:51.880]  All of it is happening now.
[00:26:52.539 --> 00:26:52.900]  Okay?
[00:26:53.319 --> 00:26:54.319]  The enemy's on the move.
[00:26:54.539 --> 00:27:01.680]  All you got to do is recognize it, call it out, and then they will not be able to do it.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.960]  Tulsi Gabbards needs to talk about it.
[00:27:04.859 --> 00:27:06.339]  R.O.K. Jr. needs to talk about it.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:12.460]  Or we're going to be sitting here in 50, 60, 70 days watching this country burn down.
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.279]  We can stop them together.
[00:27:14.779 --> 00:27:21.579]  My dad is chemistry background, also a retired doctor, but he came in to help me run my supplement division 13 years ago.
[00:27:22.079 --> 00:27:23.400]  The deep state sued the hell out of him.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.819]  We're going to our guest in a moment, but I got to do this.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.240]  Thank you, sir.
[00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:29.390]  They basically almost destroyed my parents.
[00:27:29.509 --> 00:27:35.950]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family that my dad was at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits the Democrats filed.
[00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:39.950]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are $316 million yesterday.
[00:27:40.329 --> 00:27:42.910]  They filed before they spent $80 million suing me.
[00:27:43.109 --> 00:27:44.710]  We spent $16 million fighting them.
[00:27:45.009 --> 00:27:46.609]  My dad spent $2 million fighting them.
[00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:47.750]  And we're finally winning.
[00:27:48.009 --> 00:27:59.289]  Not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnationals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request, I ask you, To support him because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:09.470]  He was giving everything to Infowars and then personally going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me because that's how dads are.
[00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:10.990]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:17.250]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office and I got pissed.
[00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:24.980]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day, and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.700]  The supplements are there.
[00:28:26.859 --> 00:28:27.500]  They're great.
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.839]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.200]  He's put everything into it he has.
[00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:30.859]  They're incredible.
[00:28:31.099 --> 00:28:40.799]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, that I don't want to belabor this.
[00:28:40.839 --> 00:28:42.119]  We have important topics to cover.
[00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:44.190]  Please support us.
[00:28:44.369 --> 00:28:46.410]  Go to drjonesdactuals.com.
[00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:47.190]  There's a new sale.

[00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:06.349]  And my dad...
[00:29:06.369 --> 00:29:12.950]  Literally took a loan last week to be able to buy the product that's coming in finally next week.
[00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.230]  Turbo Force, things like that that are popular.
[00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:17.930]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:22.410]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:24.089]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:24.849]  He's a fighter.
[00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:25.829]  Hell, he's my dad.
[00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:26.930]  I think I'm a fighter.
[00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:28.569]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:36.779]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.619]  But at this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:39.759 --> 00:29:40.700]  It's about my parents.
[00:29:41.339 --> 00:29:46.759]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's why the enemy targeted them.
[00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:50.299]  So, please support the Infowar today.
[00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:52.420]  Support my mother and my father.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.400]  I'm asking you personally for you to do it now.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:00.140]  And if 5% of the millions watching will go do it, all our problems will be over in one minute.
[00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:05.799]  But it's less than one half or one percent to ever buy anything from DrJonesNaturals.com or TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[00:30:05.859 --> 00:30:08.599]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:31.500]  We're good to go.
[00:30:33.579 --> 00:30:36.680]  Saying that they're going to have citizens in uprisings.
[00:30:36.859 --> 00:30:38.880]  You've got Carble calling for armed uprisings.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:47.880]  You have the public plan if Trump won in 2020. The Democrats have Western states secede and declare a new government.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:55.099]  And you say, well, the federal government under Trump, the rightful president, will just move against him with the military.
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.059]  Almost every general is a globalist right now in the U.S. military.
[00:30:59.259 --> 00:31:02.299]  And they've been publicly meeting to have the coup against Trump.
[00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:04.650]  So Trump's coming to kill you.
[00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:07.849]  We need to overthrow Trump.
[00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:09.970]  And if you look at that and go, that doesn't make any sense.
[00:31:10.109 --> 00:31:10.970]  Why respond to that?
[00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:11.589]  That's ridiculous.
[00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:15.170]  Well, they're going to give us the crises that make that look legitimate.
[00:31:15.569 --> 00:31:17.210]  A bunch of dead migrants.
[00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:22.029]  A power outage blamed on Russia and Trump supporters.
[00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:31.890]  And they've got their movies like Civil War made years after their plan was developed and publicly put in the New York Times.
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:42.799]  Like the New York Times is kind of their bulletin board saying a few days before Biden started bombing Russia three weeks ago we're going to start bombing Russia and two days later they did.
[00:31:45.619 --> 00:31:46.740]  It's the same thing.
[00:31:47.079 --> 00:31:58.980]  They just post there this is what we're doing to their people and they have no intention of letting Trump turn the country around.
[00:31:59.769 --> 00:32:04.730]  And you look at a movie like Civil War, almost a $400 million budget, came out this year.
[00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:21.109]  It's a bunch of minorities that have been targeted by the former racist president, who's still the president, and the media, the corporate media, and the U.S. military that's not going to put up with this evil president.
[00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:33.650]  And so they go and they kill the white Trump supporter militias, and they march on D.C., and they take over the little racist white towns, and then they go in and the black sergeant kills Trump.
[00:32:36.589 --> 00:32:39.009]  And now they're in the news saying that's their plan.
[00:32:39.829 --> 00:32:47.250]  And that Senator Blumenthal's organizing the Pentagon, that when Trump gives illegal orders, remember they said having...
[00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:52.670]  The federal government and the military assists his unconstitutional illegal orders.
[00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:57.630]  CNN, AP, Reuters, the Pentagon meeting to block Trump illegal orders.
[00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:58.569]  They believe he'll give.
[00:32:58.789 --> 00:33:00.750]  And then what did the Ninth Circuit say yesterday?
[00:33:01.009 --> 00:33:02.630]  That's completely constitutional.
[00:33:02.849 --> 00:33:05.410]  Well, I didn't need to have the Ninth Circuit tell me that.
[00:33:05.529 --> 00:33:06.589]  It's in the damn Constitution.
[00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:13.009]  But they're still going on with this.
[00:33:14.339 --> 00:33:16.000]  So, this is their plan.
[00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:17.400]  This is their plan.
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.640]  This is their plan.
[00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:34.099]  Just like I said, as soon as Trump wins the election, if we override the fraud, they will then attack Russia, inside Russia, and that's the international track.
[00:33:35.579 --> 00:33:46.779]  And then domestically, with the NGOs and the Soros networks and the Southern Poverty Law Center and the rest of them, they'll start beating the drum that we're going to resist Trump and he's Hitler when he comes to stop us.
[00:33:47.819 --> 00:34:03.589]  And do you think they're going to let those events happen where you've got 10,000 Democrats in Denver, where the, let's just guess it's that number, and the mayor, and And the governor, as well as making similar statements,
[00:34:04.109 --> 00:34:09.389]  says, we're going to have citizens fight you, and we're going to have the police waiting for you, and we're going to...
[00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:13.889]  And Tom Homan, the New Borders are, goes, well, let me read the U.S. Code to you on national television.
[00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:14.909]  Those are all felonies.
[00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:19.010]  And the mayor goes, okay, we won't get violent.
[00:34:19.869 --> 00:34:21.190]  They just jumped the gun.
[00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:26.409]  And it's not like I'm looking at this now and saying, oh, that's what they're doing.
[00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:29.230]  I told you before they did it, they'd do this.
[00:34:30.539 --> 00:34:33.599]  This is guaranteed going down.
[00:34:34.519 --> 00:34:36.519]  Unless, unless what?
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.880]  Unless we raise the alarm.
[00:34:39.059 --> 00:34:40.280]  This is ridiculous.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.219]  It's criminal.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.340]  It's transparent.
[00:34:42.619 --> 00:34:43.639]  It's out in the open.
[00:34:44.619 --> 00:34:45.920]  All of it is admitted.
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:50.900]  The military coup, stripping Trump the power of the military.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.659]  And you're like, well, Congress won't do that.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.880]  They'll have hearings during all this.
[00:34:57.489 --> 00:35:02.449]  Just to legitimize the idea for when the military leaders do it.
[00:35:02.949 --> 00:35:05.969]  And you're like, well, the rank and file military won't follow those orders.
[00:35:07.969 --> 00:35:10.769]  Not if they're not aware of this ahead of it happening.
[00:35:10.969 --> 00:35:14.409]  They'll believe the cover stories of the dead migrants.
[00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:20.650]  That's why I'm on air harping on this now.
[00:35:20.849 --> 00:35:25.710]  We have to affect the battle space in the information war.
[00:35:25.869 --> 00:35:30.269]  And look, Homan did the right thing when he said, well, we'll just arrest you.
[00:35:30.369 --> 00:35:31.989]  And then the mayor came out and apologized.
[00:35:34.869 --> 00:35:38.929]  But you've heard similar stuff out of the governor of Massachusetts and the mayor's there.
[00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:45.650]  You've heard the similar crap out of Newsom, the governor of California and mayor's there and all over.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.619]  Dozens of these jerks.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.480]  So, why?
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.500]  And it's super popular when Homan came out and said, well, just arrest your ass.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.480]  That's good.
[00:35:58.579 --> 00:35:59.679]  See, people want that.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.619]  That's constitutional.
[00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:01.699]  We want justice.
[00:36:01.699 --> 00:36:02.739]  We're tired of this.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.719]  We're tired of the invasion.
[00:36:05.079 --> 00:36:08.000]  So, it's the right thing to do, and it's ultra-popular.
[00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:15.809]  To come out and say, you keep saying everywhere Trump's gonna kill everybody and use the military.
[00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:24.809]  You're the ones that signed executive orders for martial law and to kill US citizens under civil unrest because they were planning to steal it from Trump.
[00:36:25.989 --> 00:36:32.750]  And then they were still going to have the unrest and stage stuff and blame Trump supporters on a scale much bigger than January 6th.
[00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:33.909]  And they admitted that.
[00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:40.909]  But because they weren't able to steal it, they went from that plan, but it's still on the books until Trump gets in in 45 days.
[00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:52.030]  So Trump has to come out and say, well, funny, you're the ones that have martial law in the books and killing U.S. citizens, not me.
[00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:52.710]  I'm really concerned.
[00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:53.809]  What were you planning?
[00:36:55.969 --> 00:36:58.070]  And why do you keep saying I'm going to kill everybody?
[00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:58.909]  I would never do that.
[00:36:59.289 --> 00:37:03.969]  Are you planning to stir something up or maybe make something happen?
[00:37:04.409 --> 00:37:06.090]  Boy, I find this very curious.
[00:37:07.769 --> 00:37:24.869]  What's the Senate Democrats doing talking to the Pentagon about blocking illegal orders of mine when all I've said is we're going to follow federal law and people that haven't shown up for their immigration hearings or whatever, the judges will swear out a deportation warrant under federal law, crisp and clear and totally lawful and legal.
[00:37:25.619 --> 00:37:27.400]  And the duty of the federal government.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.320]  And the 9th Circuit just said, I'm right.
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:43.380]  What are you doing telling the Pentagon in the legislative branch that you've introduced bills to strip the presidency of domestic power over the border?
[00:37:45.019 --> 00:37:45.900]  That's a coup.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.760]  That's a legislative coup introduced.
[00:37:49.159 --> 00:37:52.760]  There's freaking legislation and they're all over AP Reuters.
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:58.860]  Oh, Senator Blumenthal and other Democrat senators, they're really worried about Trump and they want to stop his martial law plan.
[00:38:00.019 --> 00:38:11.500]  Because they're going to stage the uprisings and then they're going to victimize their own people to wave the bloody shirt with their agent provocateurs.
[00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:21.309]  To then order their operatives to torch all the major cities.
[00:38:26.909 --> 00:38:45.329]  Oh, they want guardrails for Trump that when there's a domestic uprising of mostly peaceful protesters and they're having powwows at the Pentagon and telling the officers Don't follow Trump's orders.
[00:38:45.969 --> 00:38:48.789]  That's public preparation for a coup.
[00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:52.650]  Normally you don't introduce legislation for coups.
[00:38:52.809 --> 00:38:56.090]  Normally you don't publicly have the meetings and publicly say you're on the right.
[00:38:59.849 --> 00:39:02.750]  Because if anybody else ever did this somewhere, they'd be arrested.
[00:39:04.389 --> 00:39:05.989]  They'd just sneak attack with a coup.
[00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:08.369]  But they think the public's so stupid...
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:19.579]  They're trying to pre-program and legitimize it because their people are scared and know there's a 99% chance this is going to fail.
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:26.800]  Now when I say that, that's a big claim, isn't it?
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:34.039]  Well, when I say fail, even if they kill Trump and get a civil war going, I've looked at all the angles.
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.280]  They lose.
[00:39:37.889 --> 00:39:43.250]  But if they're willing to start World War III and nuclear war to stay in power, this is even a safer bet for them.
[00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:47.570]  It's the best of bad options.
[00:39:48.469 --> 00:39:50.969]  The best option would be for them to go away.
[00:39:51.969 --> 00:39:54.369]  Do you think these people are going to go away?
[00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:56.070]  I'm asking a serious question.
[00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:59.230]  Just ask yourself, are these people going to stop?
[00:39:59.469 --> 00:40:00.789]  Do they ever stop?
[00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.809]  No.
[00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:03.789]  So now you know the answer.
[00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:09.210]  So then you ask the question, what the hell are we going to do about this?
[00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:10.829]  Good Lord!
[00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:29.090]  They have coup legislation introduced, they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off, saying they're going to do all this, and the last ingredients are blowing up power stations and blaming it on Trump supporters and mowing down a bunch of migrants and blaming it on Tom Homan.
[00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:34.190]  That's it.
[00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:40.570]  And it is crickets out of the Trump incoming administration.
[00:40:42.210 --> 00:41:03.789]  On this, and the other big track, expansion, acceleration, escalation of World War III. And Europe is in total mobilization for total nuclear war,
[00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:09.090]  the worst ever in nuclear history since the 1950s, and that's all over the foreign press.
[00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:11.269]  I've shown you the headlines, so your eyes bleep.
[00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:22.469]  So, the bad guys are playing a very reckless, dangerous game of chicken that is a lot closer to...
[00:41:22.469 --> 00:41:26.650]  It's not closer to, it is...
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:30.519]  Thermal nuclear Russian roulette.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:31.480]  Pun intended.
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:41.199]  And on this path, it's not like Russian roulette where there's one bullet, one cartridge and six in the cylinder.
[00:41:43.159 --> 00:41:48.019]  On this path, all six cylinders are loaded.
[00:41:49.099 --> 00:41:52.739]  So when you pull the trigger, baby, you get it.
[00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:58.789]  So this is what dying corrupt empires do.
[00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:00.710]  They engage in desperate gambles.
[00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:04.269]  They throw cost-benefit analysis out the window.
[00:42:04.969 --> 00:42:18.570]  And the system is sitting back going, do we just keep going to nuclear war or do we just go into this plan to set up Trump supporters and Americans as all Nazis and then the forces they control are going to battle the Nazis.
[00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:19.769]  That's how they're scripting it.
[00:42:21.989 --> 00:42:27.019]  Do we sit here And put up with this.
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:29.179]  Obviously no.
[00:42:32.119 --> 00:42:35.940]  And then the other question is, what do we do about it?
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:42.300]  The globalists are losing the social war.
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:43.760]  They're losing the soft war.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.519]  They're losing the war of hearts and minds.
[00:42:45.659 --> 00:42:46.219]  They've lost.
[00:42:48.199 --> 00:42:54.539]  Unless they create crises so big, they believe that during that insanity, they can win.
[00:42:54.739 --> 00:43:01.219]  So even if they go ahead with these plans, we've got to pre-position everybody mentally to understand who did it, who was behind it.
[00:43:02.639 --> 00:43:05.940]  I mean, I'm fighting all the different scenarios here.
[00:43:09.719 --> 00:43:26.440]  Can you imagine if they do all this and trigger the internet kill switch and go to full martial law, how powerful it'll be to have this hour on a thumb drive to show your mayors and governors who won't be getting all this different advice and who aren't psychotic and aren't satanic, so they don't really have knowledge of total evil.
[00:43:26.599 --> 00:43:27.500]  They have a blind spot.
[00:43:27.599 --> 00:43:30.500]  They're going to be like, whoa, I want to work with the feds.
[00:43:30.559 --> 00:43:32.619]  We're sad Trump got killed, but we're not Nazis.
[00:43:32.619 --> 00:43:34.079]  Now let's be friendly here.
[00:43:34.199 --> 00:43:35.679]  Let's get the power back on.
[00:43:37.139 --> 00:43:38.380]  That's what they're counting on.
[00:43:38.639 --> 00:43:38.880]  No.
[00:43:39.159 --> 00:43:40.139]  Everybody has to know.
[00:43:40.539 --> 00:43:45.639]  We're trying to stop them making these moves, but even if they make them, we're then getting ready for the next phase.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.739]  That's what I'm doing right now.
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:55.159]  And in the next phase, you think people like Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan are going to be walking around?
[00:43:57.179 --> 00:43:59.420]  So this is a life and death situation for me.
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:05.920]  You can notice I've been a little more focused in the last few months because this is game time.
[00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:07.670]  This is the big one.
[00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:15.170]  I know there's millions of shows out there, and people just kind of subconsciously stop differentiating things.
[00:44:15.289 --> 00:44:17.530]  Like, oh, there's movies, entertainment, sports.
[00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:18.969]  This guy's got some stuff to say.
[00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:22.349]  You know, he's right a lot, but that kind of sounds incredible.
[00:44:23.329 --> 00:44:25.590]  What, are you going to tell me they killed 30 million people with a shot?
[00:44:26.369 --> 00:44:27.429]  Which they admittedly did.
[00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.030]  Yeah, these are crazy people.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.820]  And by the way, that news today is just over the top.
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:37.280]  And the Supreme Court on the mutilation of children in Tennessee blocking it.
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.920]  So I'm going to finish up and show you some of the articles and video clips that I mentioned here.
[00:44:45.019 --> 00:44:46.019]  It's good to have those on record.
[00:44:46.719 --> 00:44:48.539]  Again, in case you've been hiding in a cave.
[00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:51.239]  And then I'm going to get into all the other news.
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.920]  And believe me, it's massively important.
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:57.639]  And it just shows who these bad guys are, what their plan is, the fact that they're not giving us any quarter.
[00:45:02.679 --> 00:45:03.639]  It's all coming up.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:08.380]  Let's go ahead and just get to this.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:27.199]  You know, when I said it's crickets from the Trump administration, there is a popular CNN analyst who's actually from the Bush era, but strangely enough, Scott Jennings is like saying more accurate stuff than anybody except me and Stephen Bannon.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.000]  So...
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:42.619]  And he's not cutting to the chase on this, but at least he's responding every day when they say Trump's coming to kill us with the military and they have no evidence of that.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.260]  He'd say, funny you keep bringing that up.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.739]  Are you guys planning that?
[00:45:47.239 --> 00:45:48.260]  And they're like, how dare you say that?
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:50.400]  Well, you're saying he's going to kill people with the military.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.500]  You've got mayors saying you're going to have uprisings and all this.
[00:45:53.719 --> 00:45:57.440]  Looks like you're trying to get a crisis going here that you can use, right?
[00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:00.170]  That could be his milquetoast response.
[00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:06.150]  And by the way, my milquetoast response is better than what he did, but at least he's doing something.
[00:46:07.989 --> 00:46:11.070]  So, he's like one of the few people...
[00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:17.789]  Because I look at everything that's even addressing this while they run around 24-7 and say it.
[00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:22.429]  They're not putting this talking point out everywhere for no reason.
[00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:29.309]  They've not introduced legislation to strip Trump of the power over the military, which is a legislative coup for no reason.
[00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:31.889]  They're not everywhere saying Trump's going to kill everybody for no reason.
[00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:34.150]  They're planning to create that scenario.
[00:46:38.719 --> 00:46:40.659]  It's not like I'm saying that's happening.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.159]  They've already rolled this out.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.159]  It's already in play.
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.679]  The horse already got let out of the barn.
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.860]  The train left the station.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.900]  And we're just sitting there flat-footed.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.380]  Because the Republicans and Trump's like, well, that's ridiculous.
[00:46:59.659 --> 00:47:00.840]  Okay, those crazy liberals.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:02.340]  Okay.
[00:47:03.539 --> 00:47:07.099]  Here is Scott Jennings.
[00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:10.610]  I don't want to be bringing back waterboarding.
[00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:15.750]  I don't want to be a country that tortures people, especially if we're the kind of country that's going to be using the military against our own citizens.
[00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:17.730]  This kind of thing concerns me.
[00:47:17.869 --> 00:47:19.449]  What do you mean, use against our own citizens?
[00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:21.050]  I'm talking about sending...
[00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:21.449]  You said blue states behave.
[00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:22.210]  What do you mean?
[00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.969]  What are you talking about?
[00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:28.070]  I'm talking about sending the military into blue states to make them behave.
[00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:29.710]  Getting Gavin Newsom under control.
[00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:31.090]  Getting J.P. Pritzker under control.
[00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:32.170]  What are you talking about?
[00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:36.590]  What do you mean, sitting into the state capitol to commandeer the state government?
[00:47:36.809 --> 00:47:39.869]  I mean, I hope not, but he's definitely talked about that.
[00:47:39.929 --> 00:47:40.869]  I don't know why you're acting like you've never heard this before.
[00:47:40.869 --> 00:47:46.809]  Trump has talked about using the military to suppress, in the Black Lives Matter era, those protests in the street.
[00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.989]  He goes there himself.
[00:47:48.309 --> 00:48:00.570]  Just make sure I understand your position, that you believe Donald Trump is going to use the military To set up, effectively, like, coups in state capitals of states that he didn't win?
[00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:01.869]  I think you're taking it a step or two.
[00:48:01.869 --> 00:48:05.010]  No, she said make blue states behave, and she also said round up immigrants.
[00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.750]  That's not true.
[00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:07.969]  It's deport illegal immigrants.
[00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:09.969]  Scott, I don't know why you're acting.
[00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:11.869]  I'm sorry.
[00:48:11.949 --> 00:48:12.630]  Hold on.
[00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:13.309]  I mean, look.
[00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:15.170]  I think you're right.
[00:48:15.289 --> 00:48:15.929]  Let's be precise.
[00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:23.750]  Trump has wanted to use the military to do things domestically that actually the military is not allowed to do.
[00:48:23.909 --> 00:48:25.349]  I think that's the point that she's making.
[00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:26.449]  Like what?
[00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:28.210]  Like deport illegal immigrants.
[00:48:28.349 --> 00:48:30.550]  That is actually not a function of the military.
[00:48:30.849 --> 00:48:39.050]  The military can absolutely be used to work with local officials, to provide military resources, but working with other parts of the federal government and local officials.
[00:48:39.309 --> 00:48:41.070]  We already send the National Guard to the border.
[00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:44.090]  But you're not against the will of the local officials or the will of the state government.
[00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:46.210]  We have a federalist government here.
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:50.079]  The military is not supposed to take up arms against American citizens, period.
[00:48:50.099 --> 00:48:50.340]  They're not.
[00:48:50.739 --> 00:48:51.460]  You keep saying that.
[00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:52.760]  This is about illegal immigration.
[00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:54.260]  You all keep saying American citizens.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.719]  It's about illegal immigration.
[00:48:55.719 --> 00:48:57.139]  How do we know whether the people are illegal or not?
[00:48:57.699 --> 00:48:58.840]  We know after they're shot.
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.599]  We know after they die.
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:04.519]  We have 1.6 million people in Scott, you're onto illegal immigration.
[00:49:04.719 --> 00:49:05.699]  That's not the point.
[00:49:06.659 --> 00:49:10.699]  It's always back to illegal immigration with people who support Donald Trump.
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:12.559]  It's always back to illegal immigration.
[00:49:12.559 --> 00:49:16.039]  But that's not the only thing that we're talking about here.
[00:49:16.079 --> 00:49:17.739]  We're talking about the American people.
[00:49:17.739 --> 00:49:22.780]  We're talking about taking up arms against them with a military that's supposed to be protecting them.
[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:23.739]  This is not right.
[00:49:24.329 --> 00:49:28.269]  You cannot say Donald Trump is sending the military to round up.
[00:49:28.269 --> 00:49:30.610]  That's what he is saying, Scott.
[00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:31.329]  That's not what I'm saying.
[00:49:31.369 --> 00:49:32.030]  Totally false.
[00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.750]  He said that.
[00:49:32.929 --> 00:49:33.530]  Totally false.
[00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:34.429]  That's what he said.
[00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:35.269]  Scott, Scott.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:37.460]  We're in the fever swamps, Andy.
[00:49:37.599 --> 00:49:37.980]  I'm sorry.
[00:49:38.179 --> 00:49:40.059]  What is your dispute here?
[00:49:40.179 --> 00:49:41.119]  I'm not even really understanding.
[00:49:41.139 --> 00:49:45.199]  Because they're saying that he's sending the military to shoot and or round up American citizens.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.000]  Not true.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.260]  We did not say shoot.
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:48.880]  I think the issue, the issue.
[00:49:49.139 --> 00:49:50.599]  He just said take up arms.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:58.719]  Look, I did say take up arms because when you send the army in, that's what they're here for.
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:00.639]  They're all reading a script.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.039]  Remember Carvel, two weeks before the election?
[00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:07.889]  On MSNBC and CNN, he said, black men, Trump is coming to kill you.
[00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:16.510]  You need to have an armed uprising, like 1776. And then there's the black man, the CNN host, reading a script.
[00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:20.949]  You all see him look down, they look back up, they've all got a script, and they're reading a script about this.
[00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:25.809]  And again, they've got the legislation introduced.
[00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:28.130]  It's all been set up.
[00:50:28.269 --> 00:50:29.690]  It's all been prepared.
[00:50:29.809 --> 00:50:30.130]  Look at this.
[00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:31.429]  Obama signs order...
[00:50:32.279 --> 00:50:33.920]  Outlining emergency internet control.
[00:50:34.119 --> 00:50:37.099]  Remember that, CNET? This is all still in place.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:45.500]  And of course, the host, Scott Jenkins, said, wait, you mean the executive order Biden signed for martial law and killing citizens?
[00:50:45.659 --> 00:50:46.400]  No, Trump didn't do that.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.099]  He's against that.
[00:50:48.199 --> 00:50:50.739]  It'd be so easy and say, you guys have a talking point.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.300]  This is being put out by Senator Blumenthal.
[00:50:52.619 --> 00:50:53.400]  The Pentagon's meeting.
[00:50:53.519 --> 00:50:54.059]  This is illegal.
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:55.760]  You guys are planning a coup.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:51:07.340]  And when Trump responds to your blue state uprising coup and civil war and secession, which John Podesta's called for, is an official plan, you're going to call the response to your illegal operation a coup.
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:12.820]  You guys are planning an uprising like the mayor of Denver.
[00:51:13.159 --> 00:51:13.639]  Boom!
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:14.320]  You're done!
[00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:18.150]  Alright, we're going to start the next hour.
[00:51:18.329 --> 00:51:19.610]  I'm done talking about this.
[00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:20.510]  You've got your warning.
[00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:22.829]  It's up to you now to share this hour and get it out.
[00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:25.869]  Your future hangs in the balance.
[00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:26.449]  So does mine.
[00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:27.329]  Big time.
[00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.510]  These people want to break your will and totally enslave you.
[00:51:30.769 --> 00:51:33.889]  Listen, I make it easy to support this broadcast.
[00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:35.250]  I've rolled up my sleeves.
[00:51:35.389 --> 00:51:36.929]  I'm taking on the new world at 110%.

[00:51:56.679 --> 00:51:58.739]  I had a guy today at the gym say, does Seamoss really work?
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:04.000]  I said, Irish Seamoss, if you looked it up, has the most best organic iodine and super minerals and vitamins.
[00:52:04.139 --> 00:52:06.079]  The way it grows in the moss, it's concentrated.
[00:52:06.239 --> 00:52:07.260]  You're damn right it's good.
[00:52:08.119 --> 00:52:08.780]  Research it.
[00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:12.409]  And a bunch of other people, we were in the sauna, packed.
[00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:13.489]  They were like, oh yeah, that's great.
[00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:14.130]  I read about that.
[00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.489]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:16.230]  That's got atomic ion.
[00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.889]  I'm a little bit different.
[00:52:16.989 --> 00:52:19.030]  It actually has this other molecule and takes it to the cell.
[00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:20.010]  I'm like, wow, you know your stuff.

[00:53:38.019 --> 00:53:45.539]  Well, the winner, Chris DiLaro, is here in studio from New Jersey, former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[00:53:45.539 --> 00:53:46.659]  What an amazing aircraft.
[00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:48.320]  Chris, I gotta say, man, we love you.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.139]  Thanks for the support.
[00:53:49.869 --> 00:53:50.650]  I love you, Alex.
[00:53:50.849 --> 00:53:52.949]  I love Bigley, Nate, Colin.
[00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:53.590]  Thanks, Chris.
[00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:58.750]  This is one of the pinnacles in my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there, just being in this studio.
[00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:59.909]  I never imagined I'd be.
[00:53:59.909 --> 00:54:00.889]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[00:54:00.969 --> 00:54:01.590]  You're the reason we're here.
[00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:04.150]  It's so cool how cool the listeners are.
[00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:04.630]  It is.
[00:54:04.969 --> 00:54:05.110]  Yes.
[00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:05.809]  Wow, thank you.
[00:54:06.039 --> 00:54:07.119]  The listeners are amazing.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:13.099]  Like, everyone that goes to the Alex Jones store, obviously you're in it to win this truck, but this experience of coming on the show, how is this, Chris?
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:16.960]  I mean, is this not, this is like a, it's a dream, I would feel like, for the winner, right?
[00:54:17.159 --> 00:54:28.400]  Fortunately, I slept pretty good last night, but it's been very stressful because he said, Colin said, you're going on the show, and I was like, I'm a little camera shy, but here I am.
[00:54:28.519 --> 00:54:29.699]  You've done well, Lord Vader.
[00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:33.050]  I said, I'll do whatever I need to do to help Alex and Bigley.
[00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:34.889]  Well, I'm glad I got to meet you.
[00:54:34.929 --> 00:54:36.730]  We're going to eat some barbecue from Terry Black's here in a minute.
[00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:38.429]  I started to mouthwater when you said that.
[00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:39.070]  Oh, I'm starving.
[00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:43.210]  Now, real quick, this is all done by a computer, by a professional company.
[00:54:43.389 --> 00:54:44.530]  I was talking to you guys before.
[00:54:45.070 --> 00:54:46.429]  Sometimes it's in the middle of it.
[00:54:46.489 --> 00:54:47.269]  Sometimes it's at the end.
[00:54:47.369 --> 00:54:48.269]  Sometimes it's at the start.
[00:54:48.989 --> 00:54:51.489]  Have you seen where somebody who entered on the first day won?
[00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:57.429]  You know, honestly, we've done probably 30 of these giveaways and have never seen someone win on the very first day.
[00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:03.289]  But we have these multipliers that, you know, go into place, you know, maybe at the first week and the last week of the giveaway, right?
[00:55:03.369 --> 00:55:06.590]  And during these multipliers, if you spend, you know, $10, you get 100 entries.
[00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:08.690]  If you spend $100, you get 1,000 entries, right?
[00:55:08.829 --> 00:55:11.389]  It's a 10x multiplier for when you enter during that time period.
[00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:14.230]  You actually enter during the 10x time period, right?
[00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:17.210]  And at the end of the giveaway, we run the 10x time period as well.
[00:55:17.269 --> 00:55:19.730]  So it was one of the best times to enter to win.
[00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:22.789]  And, I mean, you got, you know, more entries for how much you spent.
[00:55:22.809 --> 00:55:24.329]  With the new contest, where are we right now?
[00:55:24.469 --> 00:55:27.750]  It's a brand new Ford F-250 Super Duty trimmer.
[00:55:27.769 --> 00:55:28.329]  It's sick.
[00:55:28.489 --> 00:55:29.750]  It's all black, jacked up.
[00:55:29.989 --> 00:55:31.710]  It's Alex Jones verified for sure.
[00:55:31.889 --> 00:55:32.929]  He picked the wheels.
[00:55:32.949 --> 00:55:33.789]  He picked the tires.
[00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.809]  It looks good.
[00:55:34.929 --> 00:55:35.190]  I don't know.
[00:55:35.309 --> 00:55:36.329]  Yeah, we're showing it right here.
[00:55:36.590 --> 00:55:39.230]  It also comes with $10,000 in cash as well.
[00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:40.230]  Chris, do you have that on you?
[00:55:40.389 --> 00:55:41.929]  Yeah, this is not a hoax, people.
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:50.519]  He is the winner of all the thousands of folks that came to thealexjonesstore.com and got product to be entered to win or just put your email in for free and you're entered to win.
[00:55:50.679 --> 00:55:54.980]  He bought two t-shirts, ladies and gentlemen, and he won this incredible super truck.
[00:55:55.119 --> 00:55:56.119]  Somebody can be like Chris.
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:57.800]  They can go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:09.880]  They can order the great CMOS, order any of the great supplements, t-shirts, hats, whatever, and you're entered to win a badass, brand new F-250 trimmer, fully loaded pickup truck, and you get $10,000 in cash, and we fly you down here.

[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.139]  If you just enter your email, you're still entered to win.

[00:57:10.809 --> 00:57:11.050]  Thank you.
[00:57:11.469 --> 00:57:13.469]  Somebody's about to get this sweetheart right here.
[00:57:13.989 --> 00:57:16.929]  And listen, they said I could drive it while I was down here for the last month and a half.
[00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:17.889]  Only drove it once.
[00:57:18.269 --> 00:57:19.210]  Things are too nice.

[00:57:42.929 --> 00:57:49.610]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:57:49.789 --> 00:57:51.969]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:57:53.849 --> 00:57:59.090]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:58:16.079 --> 00:58:17.880]  You must be mistaken, kind sir.
[00:58:18.239 --> 00:58:19.579]  I'm just a regular guy.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:20.880]  Bullshit!
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:22.539]  You're a wizard, Donnie.
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:29.659]  Jones Grid, I don't want this to come off too autistic.
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:34.559]  But I just get the sense that you're a really good guy.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.420]  Well, thanks for saying that, Donnie.
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:39.460]  Anywho, you know how your parents are dead?
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:44.800]  If we don't step up, everybody, everyone is going to have dead parents.
[00:58:45.199 --> 00:58:48.900]  That makes me upset, Jones Grit, in a huge way, actually.
[00:58:49.239 --> 00:58:50.139]  What do we do?
[00:58:50.539 --> 00:58:52.539]  Let's go get you some school supplies.
[00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:00.610]  These don't seem like regular school supplies.
[00:59:00.849 --> 00:59:02.710]  Oh yeah, that's because you're not going to a regular school.
[00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:08.050]  Welcome to Tism Heart.
[00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:10.869]  I am Professor Muskeldor.
[00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:15.369]  Fun fact about me, I'm angry about the way things are going in the world.
[00:59:24.639 --> 00:59:30.340]  I teach potions, but my passion is purging the school of fat kids.
[00:59:30.639 --> 00:59:32.019]  They're disgusting, okay?
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:41.360]  Class, who can tell me why Billington Gatesom and Anton Faucinius belong in Azkaban?
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:45.940]  Happy Holidays, Donny.
[00:59:46.219 --> 00:59:47.679]  It's pronounced Merry Christmas.

[00:59:58.599 --> 01:00:03.780]  Weaponized and mentally ill men dressed like special needs tramps, Professor?

[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:06.760]  75 points to libertinium.
[01:00:08.719 --> 01:00:15.860]  They're using blood magic, but we've got spells they've never heard of, like 1776 of a maxima.
[01:00:16.119 --> 01:00:18.280]  That one melts commies' faces off.

[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:12.159]  I just spent the entire first hour on the Democrats' public plan to trigger mass civil unrest once Trump is sworn in in 45 days and to cry victim whenever the Border Patrol and ICE go out and start getting the human traffickers and others.
[01:03:12.599 --> 01:03:20.719]  The Democrats are falsely claiming everywhere now in a crescendo that Trump is going to kill everybody and that it's a coup.
[01:03:21.179 --> 01:03:25.079]  No, this is them triggering an uprising as the smokescreen for their coup.
[01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:28.730]  And secession of blue states, all been announced.
[01:03:28.909 --> 01:03:30.989]  This is so historic, so dangerous.
[01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:32.710]  I just spent a whole hour on it.
[01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:52.750]  And within 30 minutes or so, we'll take that first hour and we'll post it at realalexjonesonx and band.video so that you can go get the report and share it so that we're not caught flat-footed by this.
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:04:03.500]  Because we're getting almost no response from any of the Trump people to the main Democrat attack.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.579]  And that's not good.
[01:04:08.159 --> 01:04:14.800]  So, a lot of other talk show hosts that are great people are territorial, though, still.
[01:04:15.179 --> 01:04:16.760]  And they're like, I cover that.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.800]  Why is that person covering what I first broke?
[01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:20.250]  I'm the opposite.
[01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:24.610]  I want everybody covering what I'm doing and I don't even care about credit.
[01:04:24.849 --> 01:04:25.909]  I don't give a damn about that.
[01:04:25.969 --> 01:04:26.909]  I want to stop these people.
[01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:34.429]  I love seeing all the other talk show hosts adopt my way of thinking, which is the accurate way of thinking, against the globalists.
[01:04:34.489 --> 01:04:36.909]  The globalists are in almost total control of the world.
[01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:38.190]  They want absolute control.
[01:04:39.659 --> 01:04:43.219]  They're doing horrible, terrible, evil, dehumanizing things I'm about to get into.
[01:04:43.659 --> 01:04:46.199]  And so, there's different perspectives.
[01:04:46.239 --> 01:04:47.579]  Are you for the evil?
[01:04:47.739 --> 01:04:49.579]  Are you asleep and not aware of what's going on?
[01:04:49.659 --> 01:04:50.460]  Or are you against it?
[01:04:51.239 --> 01:04:52.420]  Are you a bad guy?
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:54.159]  Are you a asleep sheep?
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:56.579]  Or are you a sheepdog fighting wolves?
[01:04:59.619 --> 01:05:00.320]  That's everything.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.980]  And people can say, well, Jones is a buzzkill.
[01:05:06.199 --> 01:05:07.219]  Well, I'm not a buzzkill.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:07.920]  You like Trump winning?
[01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:10.239]  You like turning things around?
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.840]  Well, we've got to secure that victory.
[01:05:13.079 --> 01:05:17.380]  You know, I get invited by a lot of great people who do a lot of amazing things.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:27.619]  And I, you know, got invited to be over there in Russia right now with Tucker and Tucker's folks.
[01:05:27.699 --> 01:05:33.780]  And I just, a week ago, I said, I said, great job going over there trying to stop World War III. Great job as a real journalist.
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:34.440]  Totally support you.
[01:05:34.519 --> 01:05:35.099]  You guys are amazing.
[01:05:37.239 --> 01:05:42.340]  I'm going to cover their operations here for triggering martial law.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.400]  And I don't bring that up to name drop a story or something that sounds important.
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.099]  I mean, I get calls all the time by very prominent people that live here in Austin.
[01:05:50.199 --> 01:05:51.199]  Hey, let's go out to dinner.
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:52.280]  Let's go to the comedy club.
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:53.139]  Hey, let's...
[01:05:53.139 --> 01:05:58.219]  And I'm just like, in the past I'd do that some, I'd just go, sorry, I can't do that.
[01:05:59.519 --> 01:06:00.559]  I'm in a war.
[01:06:02.189 --> 01:06:07.449]  And I'm literally going to be put in prison or killed if the bad guys win this round of the fight.
[01:06:08.289 --> 01:06:12.789]  And America's going to be totally screwed in the world and we're going to be totally impoverished and live under absolute tyranny.
[01:06:12.869 --> 01:06:15.050]  I just can't screw around any.
[01:06:16.769 --> 01:06:19.530]  And I'm not saying Tucker's screwing around, that's the opposite.
[01:06:19.650 --> 01:06:25.010]  What I'm saying is, I am literally every day saying, what is the most important thing to cover?
[01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:27.309]  What is the most important thing I can do?
[01:06:29.030 --> 01:06:40.809]  And by 6 or 7 at night, I'll be exhausted after getting up at 5.30 in the morning, and I'll just literally, without even taking a nap, I used to take naps, I just will myself to continue working.
[01:06:40.809 --> 01:06:45.769]  Because I'm just like, son, you weren't put in this position for half measures.
[01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:47.429]  That's what the Holy Spirit tells me.
[01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:49.730]  Get your ass up and attack!
[01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:55.429]  Because that's the best defense is an offense.
[01:06:56.130 --> 01:07:00.369]  So I only tell you that because people can get inside my mind where I'm at.
[01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:01.710]  I am in...
[01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:03.889]  People ask me all the time, how are you doing, Alex?
[01:07:04.269 --> 01:07:05.449]  I'm in total war.
[01:07:05.889 --> 01:07:06.329]  Really?
[01:07:07.369 --> 01:07:08.889]  Yeah, you know you're in a war, right?
[01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:11.010]  You know you're in a war, right?
[01:07:11.849 --> 01:07:13.070]  And it's a declared war.
[01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:15.050]  The Globalists have declared war on team humanity.
[01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:18.789]  They've declared war on the God that made us, the God.
[01:07:20.239 --> 01:07:21.559]  I'm about to go over all that in a moment.
[01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:31.019]  And again, it is not incredible.
[01:07:31.639 --> 01:07:33.039]  It is not heroic.
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:37.119]  It is not amazing to fight this.
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:38.900]  It is survival.
[01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:41.760]  This is the priority, people.
[01:07:42.099 --> 01:07:44.320]  This is the priority.
[01:07:45.559 --> 01:07:46.840]  This is the real world.
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:47.739]  This is game time.
[01:07:48.059 --> 01:07:50.659]  This is the crossroads of human destiny right now.
[01:07:52.199 --> 01:07:52.900]  Right now.
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:06.420]  I love getting home as early as I can with my seven-year-old daughter and playing board games with her and building a fire outside and putting up Christmas lights.
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:11.260]  And I do spend a couple hours with her every day.
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:13.880]  And I saw my other children, they're adult.
[01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:17.529]  Moved out now yesterday, spent some time with them.
[01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:20.390]  I spent three hours with my children yesterday.
[01:08:20.869 --> 01:08:23.810]  One with my older children, two with my sweet little daughter.
[01:08:25.329 --> 01:08:31.930]  But I have to not be with them because I've got to protect them.
[01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:38.229]  Just like if I was a soldier away for a year in a war, you think those soldiers want to leave?
[01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:39.750]  I have to.
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:46.399]  And I see a bunch of other people not realizing how desperate the situation is!
[01:08:47.579 --> 01:08:49.399]  We need maximum urgency!
[01:08:50.119 --> 01:08:52.960]  We're up against the most evil people the world's ever seen!
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.800]  Don't you understand that?!
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:09:10.000]  Now, I know I see this all the time because I care about what you say,
[01:09:10.079 --> 01:09:10.699]  so I read...
[01:09:11.909 --> 01:09:15.270]  When I'm on a JAG, thousands of your comments on X every day on InfoWars.
[01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:17.470]  But usually, it's not exaggerated.
[01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:20.329]  I probably read 500 comments a day because I really care about what you're saying.
[01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:21.529]  It helps me think.
[01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:23.229]  And I see it everywhere.
[01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.930]  I see it everywhere.
[01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:30.930]  You know, his show is important and I know he knows what he's talking about, but God, it's depressing.
[01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:32.170]  No, it's not.
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:35.680]  What's depressing is people that don't know they're under attack.
[01:09:36.859 --> 01:09:42.819]  Is it depressing to wake up when somebody's breaking into your garage and breaking into your back door that's going to rob you and your family?
[01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:44.199]  They got a ski mask on.
[01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:46.779]  Is it depressing that your dog barked and you woke up?
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.060]  No.
[01:09:47.279 --> 01:09:47.640]  No.
[01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:48.859]  They're breaking in your house.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.979]  It's good that you woke up and you're going to get the shotgun.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:59.140]  And that's all I'm saying is we are under attack.
[01:10:02.899 --> 01:10:03.939]  This isn't entertainment.
[01:10:03.939 --> 01:10:05.060]  It's not a game.
[01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:10.520]  And they want me off the air because I have urgency.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.060]  My head is screwed on straight.
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:20.060]  You think our ancestors under this level of attack would be acting like the general public right now?
[01:10:20.359 --> 01:10:20.640]  No.
[01:10:20.979 --> 01:10:22.859]  They'd be acting more hardcore than me.
[01:10:24.819 --> 01:10:26.319]  Because they were connected.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.899]  They had instincts.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.600]  They were real.
[01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:33.210]  They knew a threat when they saw one!
[01:10:42.489 --> 01:10:43.090]  Alright.
[01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:48.569]  But I do understand those listeners saying it's depressing.
[01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:58.810]  Do you think that I want to shovel the giant stinking piles of shit on my desk right now?
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.619]  Well, that's what Hercules did, was shovel out the Aegean stables.
[01:11:07.859 --> 01:11:09.760]  And I'd sure like some help doing it.
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:18.380]  You think you don't want to hear this?
[01:11:18.619 --> 01:11:21.460]  You think I want to tell you this?
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.100]  You think I like this?
[01:11:27.729 --> 01:11:35.909]  But the only way to get them off our backs and our children's backs is to face it and to get in there with the flies and the crap and to shovel it out.
[01:11:37.409 --> 01:11:38.270]  So help me.
[01:11:42.810 --> 01:11:44.590]  All right, let me tell you what's coming up now.
[01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:47.210]  Oh my God, it's bad.
[01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:49.529]  Here it is.
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.340]  There's the Marshall Law Plan stack right there.
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:54.380]  That's Civil War.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.159]  These freaking demons.
[01:11:57.899 --> 01:11:59.119]  Sure be nice to stop them.
[01:11:59.539 --> 01:12:00.760]  Sure be nice to admit they're doing it.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:01.800]  Sure be nice to grow up.
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:04.560]  But let's go ahead.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:05.779]  Let me just do this.
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:07.779]  Let me just tell you the stacks here.
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:13.579]  Okay, we got the Supreme Court to hear challenged to ban transgender health care for minors.
[01:12:14.159 --> 01:12:16.279]  Health care, mutilating children in a death cult.
[01:12:16.479 --> 01:12:20.920]  I have sickening clips of these people that are so disgusting that you want to throw up.
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:28.420]  And then I wanted to tie that in with all the poison shots, because it's all weapons.
[01:12:29.159 --> 01:12:36.420]  Sterilence, mutilations, surgeries, poison, HIV, spike protein, injections.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:42.899]  There's giant, super prestigious, massive new studies out that we covered four years ago.
[01:12:43.039 --> 01:12:48.359]  It was already out, but totally confirmed that the COVID mRNA shots, Pfizer and Moderna, it's the same shot.
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.300]  Moderna's is four times stronger, equivalent of four doses.
[01:12:52.899 --> 01:12:55.760]  Or like 3.8.2.
[01:12:56.079 --> 01:12:56.779]  Look it up.
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:09.979]  And when you and they inject it, it doesn't just have a bunch of DNA in there by accident.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:14.079]  It's exactly what Dr. Judy Mikovic said on the show three years ago.
[01:13:15.539 --> 01:13:21.760]  It's got every cancer virus that they ever discovered that they put in shots for 60 years.
[01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:27.449]  And it just mass produces cancer viruses in your body.
[01:13:28.409 --> 01:13:32.369]  So it's a spike protein that cuts all your DNA so it can't repair against cancer.
[01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:34.310]  It floods you with cancer viruses.
[01:13:35.409 --> 01:13:37.750]  You want to see the couple new big procedure studies?
[01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:38.430]  I'll show them to you.
[01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:41.229]  How about you read one?
[01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:42.489]  That's really fun.
[01:13:42.609 --> 01:13:43.810]  And learn what it all means.
[01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:49.210]  And all the electron microscope videos of the cancer viruses growing in you.
[01:13:50.579 --> 01:13:52.899]  You're like, well, my DNA will just fight that.
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:56.720]  Oh yeah, the spike protein goes and cuts that key part that blocks cancer in half.
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:01.979]  So it takes out your defenses, takes out your anti-aircraft guns, and then...
[01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:06.420]  And then, oh my God, Pfizer's making record profits off all the new cancer.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:07.380]  Isn't that lovely and liberal?
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:18.460]  But see, you've got to face that and realize you're under attack to do something about it.
[01:14:21.479 --> 01:14:23.819]  Now, I'll give you the good news before I start plowing more into this.
[01:14:24.479 --> 01:14:26.060]  They thought they'd get away with this.
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:27.600]  See, that's the logic of people.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:30.239]  They thought it'd be so horrible, people couldn't admit this.
[01:14:30.319 --> 01:14:32.439]  They thought they could censor those of us that knew what was happening.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:33.779]  It didn't work.
[01:14:33.939 --> 01:14:38.840]  So they are the most hated, despised globalists on Earth, the biomedical tyrants, the death cult.
[01:14:40.279 --> 01:14:52.420]  So they're totally desperate now, caught in that, caught in their human trafficking sex slavery, And that's why they're so dangerous.
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:56.619]  Because we're kicking their ass in the information war.
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.060]  We are slaughtering them right now.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:00.979]  And you're like, well, good.
[01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:02.020]  Yeah.
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:05.579]  And then so they're starting World War III and Civil War.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.039]  So, yeah, it's great we stood up and are fighting them.
[01:15:09.579 --> 01:15:12.359]  Now they're throwing everything else they got back at us.
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:14.880]  That's what a war is like.
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:17.020]  See, that's what a struggle is.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:31.880]  Somebody comes at you with a dagger trying to stab you to death, and you get out of the way and then kick them in the back, and then they roll over on the ground, maybe skin their face, and they jump back up with a bloody nose.
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:33.399]  We ain't done yet.
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:35.920]  This is a metaphor.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:36.800]  Of course, I'm not violent.
[01:15:37.119 --> 01:15:39.460]  You're going to have to do one of two things.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:40.119]  Run.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.979]  Oh, sorry, this is a globalist system.
[01:15:43.079 --> 01:15:43.699]  You can't run.
[01:15:46.159 --> 01:15:47.439]  Or you're going to have to fight.
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:51.180]  You're going to have to make the decision when they come rushing it with that dagger.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.140]  However you're going to do it.
[01:15:54.539 --> 01:15:55.439]  Step aside.
[01:15:55.739 --> 01:15:56.600]  Kick out their feet.
[01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:01.140]  When they hit the ground, jump with both your knees on the base of their neck and break their neck.
[01:16:01.539 --> 01:16:04.880]  Or do you grab that knife and shove it in?
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:06.220]  And you've got to decide.
[01:16:06.619 --> 01:16:09.899]  You've got to order your brain.
[01:16:10.159 --> 01:16:10.600]  Kill!
[01:16:11.699 --> 01:16:12.140]  Kill!
[01:16:12.939 --> 01:16:13.380]  Kill!
[01:16:13.859 --> 01:16:14.300]  Kill!
[01:16:15.199 --> 01:16:17.600]  Now, I don't want anybody to go out and be physically violent.
[01:16:17.779 --> 01:16:19.619]  I want you to kill with truth!
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.140]  Kill with your will!
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:21.880]  Kill!
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:22.539]  Kill!
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:23.899]  Kill their lies!
[01:16:24.699 --> 01:16:26.739]  I want you to kill their names!
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.279]  They attacked us!
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:31.260]  They declared war on us!
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:34.239]  And there's nowhere to run!
[01:16:36.109 --> 01:16:45.270]  And if you could see our unused power, we are 10,000 feet tall with imperishable armor of God.
[01:16:45.609 --> 01:16:49.210]  And they are a maggot with no legs.
[01:16:49.670 --> 01:17:01.750]  All we have to do is remove ourselves from their system, denounce them, rebuke them, which is the equivalent of stepping on them.
[01:17:04.239 --> 01:17:11.779]  And when that 10,000 foot steel giant steps on that little one inch maggot, it's history.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.159]  But you've shrunk yourself down to the size of an ant.
[01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:30.390]  You've reduced yourself down to some dead flesh that the maggot's gonna eat.
[01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:31.989]  I'm not a pile of dead flesh.
[01:17:31.989 --> 01:17:33.310]  I'm not food for that maggot.
[01:17:33.609 --> 01:17:35.010]  I see that maggot.
[01:17:35.109 --> 01:17:36.689]  I see how pathetic it is.
[01:17:37.810 --> 01:17:41.869]  But the 10,000 foot stainless steel sentinel is us together.
[01:17:50.529 --> 01:17:53.050]  I'm about the same size as that maggot, but I'm not a maggot.
[01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.630]  I am an ant.
[01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:58.210]  And I'm fighting that maggot right now for you and me and our children.
[01:17:58.850 --> 01:18:03.029]  And I've already fucked that maggot up pretty bad thanks to your help.
[01:18:04.569 --> 01:18:07.350]  But I'm tired of fighting them down here on their scale.
[01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:08.810]  I want to step on them.
[01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:20.109]  And to step on them, you gotta admit that they are the most evil, sick, degenerate, murderous trash the planet has ever seen.
[01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:22.789]  No half measures.
[01:18:31.770 --> 01:18:33.069]  Stop being naive.
[01:18:34.569 --> 01:18:36.710]  Stop thinking you're in Kansas and you ain't.
[01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:41.520]  You're in a war for your soul.
[01:18:43.199 --> 01:18:44.439]  All right, I said I'd come.
[01:18:44.659 --> 01:18:47.960]  Yeah, I started getting into just a couple of the stack headlines and I get pissed, man.
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:51.479]  I mean, we already knew this.
[01:18:51.579 --> 01:18:53.460]  It was Mike Adams who broke this like four years ago.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.840]  He dug up the studies that were already out there and it's all confirmed now.
[01:18:57.979 --> 01:19:01.300]  That they are injecting everyone with a Mikovits?
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:08.520]  Because she was involved in all of it and realized what she was involved in working for Fauci 20 years ago.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:09.600]  I was like, what the hell?
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:15.100]  You're putting into the main vaccine stockpiles every damn virus we ever discovered that causes cancer?
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:18.539]  It's not part of the manufacturing process.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.619]  They're doing it on purpose.
[01:19:21.779 --> 01:19:23.060]  Let that sink in.
[01:19:24.199 --> 01:19:25.819]  I know for most of you it sunk in.
[01:19:26.079 --> 01:19:35.079]  A lot of you had your husbands or wives or daughters or sons murdered by medical malpractice during COVID. You don't need me to tell you about how they're murderers because you've already experienced it.
[01:19:44.479 --> 01:19:50.640]  But how do we get these people and trances out of them?
[01:19:53.039 --> 01:19:58.939]  Well, I've heard a lot of people say, oh, you just slowly start conversations and find common ground.
[01:19:58.979 --> 01:20:01.619]  That's not how you wake people up that are in a coma.
[01:20:02.399 --> 01:20:04.720]  You hit them in the head with a metaphorical two-by-four.
[01:20:06.619 --> 01:20:07.819]  You tell them you're in a cult.
[01:20:08.989 --> 01:20:10.229]  You think the system cares about it?
[01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:11.869]  You think Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab care about it?
[01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:13.369]  You like being lied to?
[01:20:13.689 --> 01:20:15.149]  You keep betting on the system.
[01:20:15.289 --> 01:20:16.890]  You went and got your college degree that's worthless?
[01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:25.130]  And the same system that told you that lie tells you, well, just get deeper into the lie, and someday you'll finally be successful?
[01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:28.689]  It's because of the patriots and the Christians and the populists and the capitalists.
[01:20:28.789 --> 01:20:30.069]  They're the reason you're not successful.
[01:20:30.130 --> 01:20:30.750]  You're a victim.
[01:20:30.930 --> 01:20:32.229]  You're in our cult now.
[01:20:32.489 --> 01:20:35.369]  Join our victim cult, and we'll stop the victimizers.
[01:20:35.529 --> 01:20:38.229]  You're being victimized by the cult you're in.
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.579]  Not by us.
[01:20:39.779 --> 01:20:41.180]  We want you to be free.
[01:20:41.319 --> 01:20:42.420]  We want you to have prosperity.
[01:20:42.659 --> 01:20:43.680]  We are the good guys.
[01:20:47.619 --> 01:20:49.960]  We don't just look like the good guys.
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:51.979]  We are the good guys.
[01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:55.000]  And by that, you look at people fighting tyranny.
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.500]  They're smart.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:57.520]  They're intelligent.
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:58.479]  They're good-looking.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:01.060]  Black, white, Asian, old, young, Hispanic.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.359]  They don't need teleprompters.
[01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:07.000]  You look at servants of evil, they look like a bunch of...
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:09.920]  Half-starved rats or something.
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:12.579]  Because that's who they are.
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:20.079]  Go to a leptist event.
[01:21:20.079 --> 01:21:21.500]  They look like they're all dead.
[01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:24.079]  Because they are dead on the inside.
[01:21:24.979 --> 01:21:26.659]  I don't even know if I can cover it.
[01:21:26.659 --> 01:21:27.239]  I'm serious.
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.880]  I'm so beyond pissed off.
[01:21:30.079 --> 01:21:32.180]  It's not even pissed off.
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:33.619]  I'm just like...
[01:21:33.619 --> 01:21:34.500]  I mean...
[01:21:35.859 --> 01:21:38.680]  I have five stacks on the poison shots.
[01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:40.859]  I just got to one of them.
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:41.760]  Just mentioned it.
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:51.069]  These guys, right here, With Obama, cook this up.
[01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:52.689]  And they give you a shot.
[01:21:52.829 --> 01:22:05.930]  They call it a vaccine that has an HIV self-replicating spike protein in it that destroys your DNA. And then into the mix, they fire all these cancer viruses in and give you cancer.
[01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:09.069]  And I get it.
[01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:11.489]  People are like, that's too horrifying to believe.
[01:22:11.689 --> 01:22:12.909]  Okay, we'll take a shot and die.
[01:22:13.329 --> 01:22:13.949]  Look at them.
[01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:15.430]  It's funny to them.
[01:22:17.649 --> 01:22:18.829]  I don't think it's funny.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:23.020]  And you know, at the end of the day, my spirit doesn't like it.
[01:22:23.199 --> 01:22:27.300]  And when I follow the spirit, I feel good and strong and close to God.
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:29.640]  And when I don't follow it, I feel horrible.
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:36.239]  So, at the end of the day, I fight these people because that's what my cells want.
[01:22:37.159 --> 01:22:38.319]  My whole body.
[01:22:39.859 --> 01:22:40.680]  Everything in me.
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:43.239]  Everything I ever was, am, or will be.
[01:22:45.389 --> 01:22:47.890]  Imagine being that little demonic maggot.
[01:22:48.029 --> 01:23:00.069]  I mean, look at the open evil, the villain incarnate, who gets off on killing hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of people.
[01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:05.270]  A little self-appointed devil.
[01:23:08.689 --> 01:23:10.350]  He thinks she'll never wake up.
[01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:12.390]  He thinks she'll never get organized.
[01:23:13.609 --> 01:23:14.909]  He thinks he's better than you.
[01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:16.449]  He thinks that it's raw power.
[01:23:16.569 --> 01:23:21.770]  He's got survival of the fittest, social Darwinism, and he's doing you a favor killing you.
[01:23:23.229 --> 01:23:27.069]  He thinks I'm weak because I care about you.
[01:23:30.770 --> 01:23:32.510]  He thinks I'm wasting my time.
[01:23:32.789 --> 01:23:35.369]  I haven't had Fauci try to get me to join him, but I've had a bunch of them.
[01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:37.289]  I've gotten the speech 20-something times.
[01:23:42.619 --> 01:23:44.600]  No, they're the deceived ones.
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:45.279]  They're the losers.
[01:23:45.439 --> 01:23:46.260]  They're the biggest losers.
[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:50.939]  They're bigger losers than people that aren't awake and being killed by them.
[01:23:53.239 --> 01:23:59.960]  They think you deserve to be killed because they're doing this to you and you don't stand up for yourself.
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.119]  Well, I bet on you.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:09.140]  And I see humanity very rapidly waking up.
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:14.279]  But people wake up to a certain point and stop because they just, whoa, that's too scary.
[01:24:14.579 --> 01:24:16.819]  No, you've got to fully wake up with the position you're in.
[01:24:18.479 --> 01:24:21.920]  And that goes for all the enemies out there that attack me and my crew and my family.
[01:24:22.279 --> 01:24:23.779]  I actually feel sorry for you.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:24.840]  I mean, I really do.
[01:24:26.159 --> 01:24:27.920]  Because you really work for evil.
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:30.800]  And by increment, you have been totally turned to it.
[01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:32.760]  And you think you're on the winning team.
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:35.979]  And you can look around and see you're not on the winning team.
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:37.399]  You will be defeated.
[01:24:38.529 --> 01:24:41.329]  The only question is, how many people have to be destroyed in the process?
[01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:44.369]  You've already been defeated from the foundations of the earth.
[01:24:45.649 --> 01:24:47.609]  This is all a test, and you failed it.
[01:24:49.109 --> 01:24:55.869]  And you will be cut off from the almighty maker, which is a fate infinitely worse than death.
[01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:57.270]  All right, I'm gonna stop.
[01:24:58.210 --> 01:24:59.649]  I'm going to cover it when I come back.
[01:24:59.829 --> 01:25:00.470]  There's a bunch of it.
[01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:01.029]  Stay with us.
[01:25:01.449 --> 01:25:04.210]  There is a big sale going on right now.

[01:25:12.329 --> 01:25:14.430]  Two hoodies for 35% off.

[01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:29.449]  And that is here in just the next couple days.
[01:25:29.489 --> 01:25:30.590]  And then that ends.
[01:25:30.789 --> 01:25:34.069]  So there's different specials every few days.
[01:25:34.069 --> 01:25:37.289]  And that is the special right now.
[01:25:37.409 --> 01:25:39.270]  Black Friday, Cyber Monday.
[01:25:39.630 --> 01:25:44.050]  Right now, 25% off site-wide on top of all the discounts.
[01:25:44.250 --> 01:25:46.090]  And so some of these are lost leaders now.
[01:25:46.109 --> 01:25:47.409]  So I should have told you about that.
[01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:48.470]  It's just automatic in check.
[01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:50.789]  That's insane.
[01:25:50.989 --> 01:25:55.569]  That's why the owner of the company was here last week and he said, he said, Alex, you say we do too big a discount.
[01:25:55.689 --> 01:25:56.670]  Sometimes they're not enough profit.
[01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:57.750]  He goes, we're really going to hate this.
[01:25:58.050 --> 01:26:00.710]  Yeah, but their thought is you're going to love the product so much.
[01:26:00.829 --> 01:26:07.710]  You will get addicted to the ultimate CMOS. What it does, your energy, stamina, libido, focus, clarity, health.
[01:26:07.890 --> 01:26:09.010]  It's just a total superfood.
[01:26:09.090 --> 01:26:09.890]  That's what I'm on right now.
[01:26:09.949 --> 01:26:11.789]  People see how my skin glows, so much energy.
[01:26:11.789 --> 01:26:12.729]  It's just amazing.
[01:26:12.909 --> 01:26:14.689]  So we try to make it easy for you to support.
[01:26:14.869 --> 01:26:17.789]  You really want the supplements at thealexfieldstore.com.
[01:26:17.890 --> 01:26:19.010]  They really are game-changing.
[01:26:19.090 --> 01:26:19.750]  They really do work.
[01:26:19.810 --> 01:26:20.510]  They really are amazing.
[01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:24.270]  The t-shirts, hundreds and hundreds of great designs of ball caps, t-shirts, hoodies.
[01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:25.390]  I mean, they're just amazing.
[01:26:25.630 --> 01:26:26.409]  So proud of them.
[01:26:26.489 --> 01:26:27.989]  With our great sponsor, The Alexfield Store.
[01:26:28.130 --> 01:26:29.310]  Which, again, is not owned by me.
[01:26:29.869 --> 01:26:32.630]  Even if the bad guys are able to get InfoWars, they have no claim on that.
[01:26:32.729 --> 01:26:34.710]  It will continue on as our sponsor at the Alex Jones Network.
[01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:37.310]  So now is the time to take action.
[01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:40.810]  The Alex Jones gear, the Patriot gear, the 1776 gear.
[01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:47.930]  I'd put it in Trump gear, Alex Jones InfoWars gear, and Patriot 1776 Founding Father type stuff.
[01:26:48.069 --> 01:26:49.050]  That's my favorite gear.
[01:26:49.210 --> 01:26:51.369]  And funny, the stuff I like the best is the best selling.
[01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:53.689]  It goes Patriot gear, Alex Jones gear.
[01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:54.890]  It's the same thing, but you know...
[01:26:57.650 --> 01:27:01.270]  It's great Trump gear, but quite frankly, that shirt's really popular right there.
[01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:04.350]  Trump, better coverage than Verizon, now do you hear us.
[01:27:04.569 --> 01:27:07.989]  But no, the Trump gear is the least popular category.
[01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:10.550]  People like the anti-New World Order, pro-America stuff.
[01:27:10.810 --> 01:27:11.210]  That's...
[01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:12.850]  That's what I guess would be most popular.
[01:27:12.930 --> 01:27:13.689]  That's what's most popular.
[01:27:13.989 --> 01:27:15.729]  I would think Team Humanity would be very popular.
[01:27:15.729 --> 01:27:16.189]  It's not.
[01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:17.890]  That's what we are on.
[01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:22.710]  So, and then as I said, also all those other specials and more.
[01:27:23.050 --> 01:27:25.210]  So 25% off on top of everything at checkout.
[01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:29.369]  It's just automatic and 40% off on the t-shirts and hats.

[01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:34.970]  30% off on the supplement bundle on top of the other specials.
[01:27:35.109 --> 01:27:46.689]  And VIP members will be emailed a link where you'll either have $30, $40, or $50 extra on top of the $40 you get a month being a VIP to spend on the store for $30 a month you spend.
[01:27:46.930 --> 01:27:49.229]  And you get all those other great specials, cancel anytime.
[01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:51.829]  All at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:19.399]  All right, in February of 2017, Fauci, addressing a whole bunch of the biomedical eugenicist death cult, we played the clip yesterday, said, don't worry, Trump's going to get hit by a brand new pandemic real quick,
[01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.020]  and that'll cut him down to size.
[01:28:21.779 --> 01:28:24.079]  He said, I guarantee it, watch.
[01:28:25.109 --> 01:28:39.449]  Well, now his mini-me, Peter Hotez, has crawled out from under a rock and gone on MSNBC and said, we got some big stuff coming down the pike for him on January 21st.
[01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:42.329]  His first full day as president.
[01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:45.229]  Got some big nasties for you.
[01:28:47.630 --> 01:28:48.550]  Oh, and look.
[01:28:50.130 --> 01:28:52.590]  Amid bleeding eye virus scare...
[01:28:54.149 --> 01:29:00.090]  Mystery disease with flu-like symptoms kills almost 150 in Africa, sparks pandemic fears.
[01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:03.869]  Yeah, what have some of the top globalists said?
[01:29:05.449 --> 01:29:15.369]  In the past, they said airborne Ebola will be what they use to bring in their world government.
[01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:27.270]  Health officials investigate mystery disease in southwest Congo after 143 deaths and growing.
[01:29:27.689 --> 01:29:34.590]  The flu-like disease that has killed dozens of people over two weeks is being investigated in southern Congo.
[01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:37.270]  Local authorities said, oh, the UN, of course.
[01:29:37.810 --> 01:29:46.750]  The deaths were recorded between November 10th and November 25th in the Pansy Health Zone of Quango province.
[01:29:47.449 --> 01:29:51.729]  Symptoms include fever, headache, cough, and anemia.
[01:29:53.619 --> 01:30:03.800]  Provincial health minister said, a team of epidemiological experts is expected in the region to take samples and identify the problem.
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:09.199]  Oh, but don't worry, the UN's going to save us.
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:12.859]  Unknown disease kills 143 in southwest Congo.
[01:30:13.039 --> 01:30:17.300]  Local authorities say, all right.
[01:30:21.579 --> 01:30:37.079]  And then let's go to what old Peter Hotez, I remember he said a few months ago, he goes, I just met with Tedros, the director of the WHO, and we need to have the UN and NATO take over America and arrest people that don't agree with us.
[01:30:37.159 --> 01:30:37.760]  They're violent.
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:39.020]  They're telling you not to take shots.
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:39.680]  That's violent.
[01:30:39.939 --> 01:30:41.399]  We need to arrest people.
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.220]  The UN does.
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:44.340]  You're like, well, that's Hotez.
[01:30:44.479 --> 01:30:44.880]  Oh, really?
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:51.520]  Then Eric Schmidt of Alphabet says, The parent company of Google came out and said it at Stanford and a bunch of others.
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:56.460]  They're like, gosh, what would the climate be like to get that done?
[01:31:01.119 --> 01:31:03.819]  Hotez, COVID-19 was just a warm-up act.
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:05.859]  That's what Bill Gates said four years ago.
[01:31:05.939 --> 01:31:07.800]  He said, oh, this is just a test.
[01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:09.880]  Something far worse is coming.
[01:31:10.199 --> 01:31:11.760]  Something that targets children.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.939]  Something that makes your eyes bleed.
[01:31:14.359 --> 01:31:15.279]  That'll scare you.
[01:31:18.279 --> 01:31:23.300]  Five big public health threats the Trump administration may face day one.
[01:31:23.939 --> 01:31:26.340]  Isn't that a nice little man?
[01:31:29.319 --> 01:31:30.840]  Here's what he had to say.
[01:31:32.099 --> 01:31:42.060]  Here's the reason why we need to care about this stuff, Nicole, is that we have some big picture stuff coming down the pike starting on January 21st.
[01:31:42.399 --> 01:31:46.439]  Mr. Bloomberg mentioned H5N1. That I'm really worried about.
[01:31:46.579 --> 01:31:52.119]  It's all over wild birds on the western part of the United States and going up in the north.
[01:31:52.119 --> 01:31:53.460]  It's getting into the poultry.
[01:31:53.659 --> 01:31:56.079]  We're seeing sporadic human cases.
[01:31:56.079 --> 01:31:59.239]  No human-to-human transmission yet, but that could happen.
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:00.039]  It's in the cattle.
[01:32:00.159 --> 01:32:00.800]  It's in the milk.
[01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:02.189]  And that's just the beginning.
[01:32:02.369 --> 01:32:06.069]  We have another major coronavirus likely brewing in Asia.
[01:32:06.170 --> 01:32:15.789]  We've had SARS in 2002, SARS-2, COVID-19 in 2019. And we know these viruses are jumping from bats to people thousands of times a year.
[01:32:16.130 --> 01:32:17.590]  But there's still more.
[01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:31.069]  We know that we have a big problem with mosquito-transmitted viruses all along the Gulf Coast, where I am here in Texas, or expecting dengue and possibly Zika virus coming back, or Apuche virus.
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:32.680]  Maybe even yellow fever.
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:33.720]  And there's more.
[01:32:33.899 --> 01:32:42.960]  Then we have all this sharp rise in vaccine-preventable diseases going up because of, in part, the anti-vaccine activism that's so prominent right now.
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:49.119]  We have a five-fold rise in pertussis cases, whooping cough over the last year, 15 measles outbreaks this year.
[01:32:49.239 --> 01:32:52.479]  We've got polio that's been in the wastewater in New York State.
[01:32:52.819 --> 01:32:57.699]  All that's going to come crashing down on January 21st on the Trump administration.
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:01.239]  We need a really, really good team to be able to handle this.
[01:33:02.010 --> 01:33:08.489]  And so they're going to try to create all this fear and get their people back in to kill the whole Trump agenda with a bunch of fear-mongering.
[01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:13.430]  And they'll roll out a bunch of new poison shots, which is already an emergency authorization for, like monkeypox.
[01:33:13.529 --> 01:33:14.609]  People get really sick and die from that.
[01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:18.729]  And they go, oh, look, people are dying from the ding-dong fever.
[01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:26.130]  And then they've got this new hemorrhagic thing, it looks like, in the Congo, all right on time.
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:31.460]  Here's, remember what Fauci said right when Trump came into office last time, here it is.
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:50.380]  Given, as you heard from the introduction, that I have been around for a while and have had the opportunity and the privilege and the pleasure of serving in five administrations, I thought I would bring that perspective to the topic today is the issue of pandemic preparedness.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:34:06.859]  And if there's one message That I want to leave with you today based on my experience, and you'll see that in a moment, is that there is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases,
[01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:16.140]  both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease, and we have certainly a large burden of that, but also there will be a surprise outbreak.
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:36.710]  And I hope by the end of my relatively short presentation you will understand why history The history of the last 32 years that I've been the director of NIAID will tell the next administration that there's no doubt in anyone's mind that they will be faced with the challenges that their predecessors were faced with.
[01:34:48.609 --> 01:34:51.550]  It's publicly said they would use the disease X to bring in world government.
[01:34:51.909 --> 01:34:52.430]  Just type in.
[01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:57.989]  UN, WHO said world government needed to stop future disease Xs.
[01:34:58.090 --> 01:34:59.010]  They've been saying that for 20 years.
[01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:01.449]  And then you actually read their war games.
[01:35:01.569 --> 01:35:03.529]  They basically tell you they're going to release the viruses.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:20.720]  Fauci said on C-SPAN two years before coming, he goes, a new virus will be coming out of China, respiratory, and we will use that to blow up the old system and bring in our new system, where there will no longer be any testing, we will just test directly on the publics.
[01:35:22.439 --> 01:35:25.220]  I can pull the club up, I played it recently, and he says that.
[01:35:26.899 --> 01:35:30.340]  They're all there laughing and smiling, oh, we're in charge, ha ha!
[01:35:36.789 --> 01:35:38.149]  That's how they hold you hostage.
[01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:43.470]  Somebody holds you hostage with a gun, the cops come, they shoot the bad guy.
[01:35:43.710 --> 01:35:52.930]  But if you do it with viruses and then you're the ones that release it, and then you're the ones that run the system and respond to it, you're the hero while you kill people and get rich.
[01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:54.529]  Works out pretty good.
[01:35:54.909 --> 01:36:00.689]  Then you bring in the world government cashless society based on the vaccine passport, and then you control everybody that way.
[01:36:02.250 --> 01:36:02.949]  And then...
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:10.199]  Judicial Watch sued in 2007 and got the documents from the North American Union UN meeting in BAM Canada.
[01:36:10.439 --> 01:36:11.539]  It's in my film, Endgame.
[01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:16.100]  And they said, we're going to use virus threats to bring in world government.
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:30.800]  And to silence critics of the WHO. Self-appointed depopulationists that say they're saving the earth by trying to depopulate us.
[01:36:30.819 --> 01:36:32.579]  And for the first time ever, the world population is dropping.
[01:36:34.849 --> 01:36:36.270]  Since recorded history.
[01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:43.289]  And life expectancy's dropping and cancer's exploding and autism's exploding.
[01:36:43.770 --> 01:36:46.869]  I mean, what, like 1 in 50,000 back in the 70s?
[01:36:46.930 --> 01:36:49.590]  Now it's like 1 in 10, about to be 1 in 3?
[01:36:51.210 --> 01:36:53.430]  Just keep taking your shots, kids!
[01:36:55.029 --> 01:36:56.329]  But let me move through these stories.
[01:36:57.939 --> 01:37:12.119]  Breaking new study urges immediate halt to COVID-19 mRNA injections over alarming levels of DNA in the Journal of Science and Public Health Policy and Law with a whole list of top scientists.
[01:37:13.979 --> 01:37:40.779]  And it goes on to say the COVID-19 mRNA injections, Moderna and Pfizer, have extremely concentrated mutagenic DNA carrying RNA packages of SV40 and a whole bunch of other super deadly cancer-causing viruses.
[01:37:41.119 --> 01:37:46.939]  I don't mean cancer-causing like smoking cigarettes that just breaks your DNA and then you get mutations.
[01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:50.579]  No, I mean it goes in and orders cells to become tumors.
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:54.000]  You know most cancers viral, right?
[01:37:56.449 --> 01:37:59.449]  That's something they don't really teach in schools, but look it up.
[01:37:59.710 --> 01:38:01.210]  That's what a wart is.
[01:38:01.710 --> 01:38:05.010]  A virus that causes a skin cancer.
[01:38:05.210 --> 01:38:10.390]  But it's called benign because it doesn't tend to take over other tissues.
[01:38:13.770 --> 01:38:19.289]  These create malignant cancers.
[01:38:20.659 --> 01:38:25.380]  So the spike protein turns off your DNA, cuts it at the exact spot.
[01:38:25.539 --> 01:38:28.039]  Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:37.619]  And then your body can't repair, and in comes the loving, liberal cancer viruses.
[01:38:40.359 --> 01:38:46.140]  Breaking new study urges immediate halt to COVID-19 mRNA injections over alarming levels of DNA contamination.
[01:38:47.659 --> 01:38:49.720]  Dr. Peter McCullough, let's get him on now.
[01:38:50.239 --> 01:38:53.680]  Researchers find DNA contamination in COVID-19 mRNA.
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:56.460]  It's not contaminated if it's there on purpose.
[01:38:57.619 --> 01:39:00.180]  This gasoline is contaminating my engine.
[01:39:02.199 --> 01:39:09.520]  Researchers find DNA contamination in COVID-19 mRNA injections exceeding regulatory limits over 300%.
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:12.779]  But then the best part is it's not just some random stuff.
[01:39:12.899 --> 01:39:15.859]  No, it's the most deadly cocktail ever known, perfectly prepared.
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:20.399]  Confirming findings from earlier studies.
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:25.000]  When will large vaccinated groups show concern over themselves?
[01:39:27.359 --> 01:39:29.600]  And here's another study for you.
[01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:32.619]  From the University of South Carolina.
[01:39:33.119 --> 01:39:39.000]  Headed up by Philip Buxenholtz, PhD, professor of cancer molecular genetics.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.399]  The Pfizer mRNA vaccine is contaminated with a plasma DNA vector.
[01:39:45.079 --> 01:39:46.920]  Vector means it spreads.
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:57.300]  That is used as the template for in vitro transcription reaction.
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:39:59.800]  That means it replicates in you.
[01:40:00.359 --> 01:40:08.199]  His DNA, this DNA could be the cause of some of the rare but serious side effects like death.
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:12.239]  Yeah, it starts a viral reaction.
[01:40:16.289 --> 01:40:28.970]  The DNA can and likely will integrate into genomes of transfected cells.
[01:40:30.109 --> 01:40:38.810]  There is a very real hazard for genome modification, mutation, of long-lived somatic cells.
[01:40:42.670 --> 01:40:43.989]  What are they growing this stuff on?
[01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:45.949]  Immortal cell lines.
[01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:47.409]  Zombie cells.
[01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:54.920]  Which could cause sustained autoimmune attack Towards that issue.
[01:40:55.579 --> 01:40:56.140]  Tissue.
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:03.539]  There is also a theoretical risk of future cancer depending on the piece of DNA and the site of integration.
[01:41:03.899 --> 01:41:06.859]  And then it's the most deadly cancer viruses ever known.
[01:41:06.859 --> 01:41:10.180]  A whole bunch of them put in there for you.
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:11.579]  And look at this.
[01:41:11.699 --> 01:41:13.159]  They've got nice graphics of it.
[01:41:14.079 --> 01:41:17.000]  This is an older study.
[01:41:17.159 --> 01:41:18.840]  And we were telling you this four years ago.
[01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:25.770]  And now they have looked and grown from the vaccines that aren't vaccines.
[01:41:25.930 --> 01:41:26.789]  What's in it?
[01:41:26.909 --> 01:41:27.949]  Let me show you the new study.
[01:41:28.810 --> 01:41:31.029]  Under electron microscopes.
[01:41:31.590 --> 01:41:32.590]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:41:33.050 --> 01:41:36.850]  And you can see what they're growing in you and read all about it.
[01:41:36.970 --> 01:41:41.909]  It's the most deadly cocktail of all the most deadly publicly known cancer viruses.
[01:41:42.189 --> 01:41:49.810]  All grown and prepared and put in stasis in the shot to slowly murder you with love.
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:52.479]  It's so trendy.
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:55.119]  It's so liberal.
[01:41:56.079 --> 01:41:58.100]  It's so much fun.
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:02.159]  Let's get Dr. Judy Mikovits on.
[01:42:02.399 --> 01:42:06.500]  She was on the show over four years ago saying all of this and giving the documents, but she's so pissed.
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:07.020]  She's like me.
[01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:08.819]  She's rattling off stuff like a machine gun.
[01:42:11.819 --> 01:42:13.539]  Okay, I got to one of those stacks.
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.420]  There's only four more on the shots today.
[01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:16.000]  I'm sorry.
[01:42:22.479 --> 01:42:23.520]  Let's move to the next one.
[01:42:25.399 --> 01:42:26.100]  Oh boy.
[01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:28.000]  These are big.
[01:42:35.239 --> 01:42:38.520]  Took me about two hours last night to just fast read through all this.
[01:42:38.659 --> 01:42:40.000]  Of course, I already know most of it because I look at it all the time.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.779]  This is more studies, more documents, more proof, more hell, more horror, more mass killing.
[01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:45.479]  Oh, look at this little lady.
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:48.020]  She's got that demon stare.
[01:42:48.939 --> 01:42:50.420]  She's committing a mass crime.
[01:42:50.939 --> 01:43:03.279]  CDC accelerates childhood hyper-vaccination plan for 2025. 32 shots by age 2. By age 361. And then let's move on to this.
[01:43:03.579 --> 01:43:04.439]  Here's the schedule.
[01:43:06.119 --> 01:43:08.560]  Nice graphic describing basically what it does.
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:10.359]  Mommy holding the baby under the water.
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:12.000]  Helping the baby.
[01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:12.819]  Mommy stayed.
[01:43:13.079 --> 01:43:13.760]  There you go.
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:14.439]  Go bye-bye.
[01:43:16.090 --> 01:43:24.369]  Here's a clip of Fauci saying, you don't want to give people shots of cold viruses like COVID during an outbreak.
[01:43:24.369 --> 01:43:27.010]  It causes deadly mutations, which then he did.
[01:43:27.949 --> 01:43:29.390]  That's just a video of him saying it, though.
[01:43:30.949 --> 01:43:31.770]  Oh, look at this.
[01:43:31.770 --> 01:43:32.789]  I see these all the time.
[01:43:32.909 --> 01:43:35.989]  You know, I worked for a large animal vet off and on for four years.
[01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:37.750]  One time for a whole year.
[01:43:38.409 --> 01:43:41.210]  And then I also worked for a small animal vet for a year before that.
[01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:45.869]  And I would always hear them just tell people, look, you don't need to give your dog these shots.
[01:43:46.510 --> 01:43:49.409]  And they would say, yeah, no, the dogs and cats die.
[01:43:49.569 --> 01:43:51.729]  They get autoimmune diseases when we...
[01:43:51.729 --> 01:43:56.069]  Oh, by the way, that's in the big study because you had autoimmune disease.
[01:43:56.289 --> 01:44:00.529]  It basically gives the cats and dogs AIDS. Mainly cats are the ones that really get killed by the loving shots.
[01:44:01.010 --> 01:44:04.470]  Oh, but here's a new big report by the company itself actually had a soul.
[01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:09.609]  A common big pharma dog vaccine linked to mass canine death.
[01:44:10.909 --> 01:44:14.949]  And it goes into how it causes the same anaphylactic shock.
[01:44:15.170 --> 01:44:17.609]  A lot of times the dogs are dead within one hour.
[01:44:18.289 --> 01:44:19.250]  That's liberal.
[01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:32.010]  A common vaccine given to dogs has been found to contain eugenics chemicals which have caused the mass culling of dogs worldwide.
[01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:45.439]  The Tredelia osteopeptoeum The osteopeto vaccine, what a nice little name, is used to vaccinate dogs against a strain of bacteria.
[01:44:45.979 --> 01:44:54.319]  However, after the vaccine was exposed for killing and maiming the recipients, the company decided to voluntarily withdraw the jab.
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:55.800]  Go read it for yourself.
[01:44:55.939 --> 01:44:56.800]  It gets a lot worse.
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:58.239]  We gotta move quick here.
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:03.500]  I know we don't care about people, but some of the liberals might care about the puppy dogs.
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:14.300]  Remember, if the oxygen level of kids wearing masks in the classroom were the same as the ones inside the mask, she would be instructed to evacuate the building immediately.
[01:45:18.699 --> 01:45:20.119]  Oh, let's continue.
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:26.159]  Oscar Cabrera...
[01:45:27.130 --> 01:45:34.029]  Adams, dead from heart attack after blaming heart condition on COVID vaccine, myocarditis.
[01:45:34.170 --> 01:45:37.069]  He died of a massive heart attack during a stress test.
[01:45:37.229 --> 01:45:44.869]  He fought for his life for several years, but the viruses that they injected him with destroyed his heart, and he's dead now.
[01:45:46.890 --> 01:45:50.350]  But Peter Hotez is happy now.
[01:45:51.239 --> 01:46:05.300]  A nice graphic that describes all this, shows a stone, a spear, an arrow, a bullet, a Sidewinder missile, and then a syringe.
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:08.720]  That is the evolution of war.
[01:46:09.859 --> 01:46:12.579]  Silent weapons for quiet wars.
[01:46:14.529 --> 01:46:16.710]  And then we read about what's recently happened.
[01:46:16.930 --> 01:46:20.210]  Parents appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court over forced COVID vaccines.
[01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:29.310]  Seven states have ruled we're going to force inject your kids and not tell you isn't that liberal.
[01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:33.329]  And there's more.
[01:46:33.850 --> 01:46:35.489]  There's a lot more, obviously.
[01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:38.029]  But, I mean, I'm a killjoy.
[01:46:38.229 --> 01:46:40.489]  I really shouldn't even be talking about this.
[01:46:41.229 --> 01:46:42.350]  I'm the bad man.
[01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:46.600]  You heard CNN said, I'm continuing here.
[01:46:48.359 --> 01:47:03.380]  Matt Hancock, who got caught admitting that the COVID thing was all fake, it was about control, and his text messages that came out who ran the poison shot operations in the UK. More of his messages have come out, and now Matt Hancock is cracking jokes about Bill Gates' conspiracy.
[01:47:05.159 --> 01:47:10.159]  He joked about Bill Gates ought to be paying me a lot of money for all the people I injected with his chips.
[01:47:11.359 --> 01:47:28.939]  Well, he does own a company that does put nanochips in vaccines to track you, but what they put is self-replicating nanotech spike protein to cut off and self-replicate your DNA defense system, and then they load you with hundreds of known top cancer viruses.
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:32.619]  So it's far worse than a microchip.
[01:47:33.239 --> 01:47:36.920]  I was talking to my Navy SEAL buddy, and this has come out in the news as well.
[01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:39.340]  I first broke it over 20 years ago.
[01:47:41.810 --> 01:47:45.109]  And when they were going through bugs training, they make them swallow a microchip.
[01:47:46.170 --> 01:47:51.590]  And I said, how long did the microchip, because they could come up with a computer, just like Star Trek, and see their vitals with it.
[01:47:52.939 --> 01:47:57.119]  And he said, well, they claim it would come out after Bud's, but probably never left.
[01:47:57.899 --> 01:48:00.460]  But the point is, is that I had a family member who's an officer.
[01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:01.520]  He's out of the Army now.
[01:48:02.619 --> 01:48:06.479]  And he was at a meeting in Texas at a base.
[01:48:06.579 --> 01:48:09.520]  And he said I could talk about it, just not, you know, say his name.
[01:48:09.699 --> 01:48:11.720]  But they figured it out and called him in.
[01:48:12.539 --> 01:48:13.180]  And they were there.
[01:48:13.279 --> 01:48:14.180]  It was like 20 years ago.
[01:48:14.779 --> 01:48:17.640]  And they told him, yeah, soon you're all going to be getting microchips.
[01:48:17.819 --> 01:48:22.020]  And just for people that don't know, host of the military has got microchips for about 15 years.
[01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:26.479]  But see, that's compartmentalization.
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:33.699]  I go into a business routinely, and they're always asking me.
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:36.100]  I get asked about Joe Rogan all the time, obviously, and Tucker Carlson.
[01:48:36.439 --> 01:48:38.140]  People are always like, Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan.
[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:38.920]  I love Joe Rogan.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:39.779]  You ever talk to Joe Rogan?
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:41.359]  I talk to Joe all the time, almost every day.
[01:48:41.659 --> 01:48:43.340]  And they go, man, I'm really...
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:45.619]  I heard the president was in town to talk to him.
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:46.100]  I'm like, yeah.
[01:48:46.939 --> 01:48:47.300]  Yeah.
[01:48:48.979 --> 01:48:52.180]  And Joe Rogan's offices are across the street.
[01:48:52.539 --> 01:48:52.899]  Yeah.
[01:48:53.979 --> 01:48:56.859]  It's just funny because he's right by his office and I'm over at this place all the time.
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:57.619]  It's a gym.
[01:48:58.479 --> 01:49:02.199]  And it's a perfect example of compartmentalization.
[01:49:02.399 --> 01:49:04.260]  Like, almost all the military's got microchips.
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:07.000]  But they're not supposed to talk about it.
[01:49:07.079 --> 01:49:08.800]  But it's come out in Congress and things like that.
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:09.720]  I first broke it.
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:21.779]  But the point is, is that just like I first broke 29 years ago, that The baby blood they take for the heel test, they claim it's for blood tests, is sent into a Pentagon database.
[01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:25.579]  And then it broke a few years after we broke that, but we got the documents from a nurse in San Antonio.
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:28.760]  The point is, this is all an example of compartmentalization.
[01:49:30.739 --> 01:49:33.340]  Where the stuff's going on all around, you know, good stuff.
[01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:36.060]  Like, Joe Rogan's 50 yards away, but you don't know it.
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:38.939]  And of course, I don't tell people, oh, Joe Rogan's right there.
[01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:41.020]  You see, his car's parked right there.
[01:49:41.319 --> 01:49:42.840]  I go, oh yeah, Joe Rogan, great guy.
[01:49:43.539 --> 01:49:46.039]  I might go have some coffee with him in 20 minutes, but I don't tell him that.
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:52.500]  So, that's good compartmentalization.
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:55.020]  Well, imagine what's going on all around you you don't know about.
[01:49:55.399 --> 01:49:56.859]  This is the stuff we know about.
[01:49:57.039 --> 01:49:57.680]  All right, we're going to break.
[01:49:59.069 --> 01:50:01.210]  Obviously, this information is so vital.
[01:50:01.810 --> 01:50:05.229]  Obviously, you want it to continue to get out, so we frustrate the enemy plans.
[01:50:05.369 --> 01:50:07.010]  So I make it easy for you to support.
[01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:11.590]  We've got the Black Friday Cyber Week Super Sales going.
[01:50:11.890 --> 01:50:16.890]  We're talking 30 to 40% off on top of the big discounts on the best supplements.
[01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:20.989]  Incredible, widest selection of some of the best designs of Patriot gear.
[01:50:22.010 --> 01:50:25.710]  It funds the operation, and we have the fundraiser shirts.
[01:50:25.970 --> 01:50:28.050]  You know, the shirts are $25, $30.
[01:50:30.439 --> 01:50:31.819]  Christmas sweaters, all that.
[01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:32.619]  Hoodies.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.460]  But we have a couple of fundraiser shirts.
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:40.840]  The same Alex Jones broadcast limited edition t-shirt is like $42.
[01:50:41.739 --> 01:50:44.699]  And then another one, so we get some real money in for those.
[01:50:44.699 --> 01:50:45.720]  So if you really want to support...
[01:50:46.739 --> 01:50:53.920]  Get the Rebellion to Tyrants limited edition fundraiser t-shirt, Rebellion to Tyrants, Disobedience to God, 1776, that I designed.
[01:50:54.119 --> 01:50:59.520]  And then there's the other classic Infowars, red on navy blue, that also designed the American flag.
[01:50:59.739 --> 01:51:02.500]  Both of those shirts are $42.99.
[01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:06.119]  I guess I got another limited edition fundraiser shirt, Darkest Hour.
[01:51:06.159 --> 01:51:06.939]  I didn't design that one.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:07.359]  It's okay.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.600]  I don't think I really look like Winston Churchill, but all right.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.220]  They make a lot of cool designs.
[01:51:12.319 --> 01:51:13.079]  That's not one of my favorites.
[01:51:15.070 --> 01:51:16.590]  Gosh, I guess they got more than...
[01:51:16.590 --> 01:51:17.310]  I thought I was only...
[01:51:17.310 --> 01:51:18.369]  Those have two fundraiser shirts.
[01:51:18.510 --> 01:51:18.829]  Okay, great.
[01:51:18.909 --> 01:51:19.869]  Those are all fundraiser shirts.
[01:51:20.409 --> 01:51:25.630]  I mean, you know, we raise a little money off, you know, a t-shirt for $25, $30, but they're high quality.
[01:51:25.630 --> 01:51:30.989]  It costs like $15, $16, $70, depending on the size of the shirt, then you got to print them, and then, you know, the sponsor gets...
[01:51:32.050 --> 01:51:38.710]  Half the money, and then for us to have money to operate, we're going to get like five, six, seven bucks on a t-shirt, but not with the fundraiser shirts.
[01:51:38.789 --> 01:51:39.630]  You really want to support?
[01:51:40.170 --> 01:51:47.210]  Get the fundraiser shirts, and I want to thank you for your support, but you definitely want to get the Ultimate CMOS. You definitely want to get the Detox.
[01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:49.250]  You definitely want to get the Energy Gummies and the Sleep Gummies.
[01:51:49.250 --> 01:51:53.189]  They're all amazing, and they fund the second American Revolution worldwide.

[01:55:55.199 --> 01:55:59.800]  The Mockingbird Media is now using the term Pizzagate as a verb.
[01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:06.979]  For example, in 2020, NBC News ran the article, Inside the Campaign to Pizzagate Hunter Biden.
[01:56:07.199 --> 01:56:22.689]  The article goes on to attempt to arrogantly debunk The boogeyman of far-right QAnon conspiracy theories, stemming from the alleged pictures on the Hunter Biden laptop of Hunter Biden engaging in his twisted lifestyle with children.
[01:56:22.949 --> 01:56:34.909]  Fast forward to post-Epstein death 2023, and those pictures are not only public record, they continue to be ignored by Biden's corrupt DOJ. The conspiracy theorists...
[01:56:34.909 --> 01:56:38.890]  While the mental toll of cognitive dissonance comes crashing down.
[01:56:39.119 --> 01:56:44.000]  And the craziest fake news of all is something called Pizzagate.
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:57.699]  People actually believe a conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton and her former campaign manager John Podesta ran a child sex ring at a pizzeria in DC. This is a lie.
[01:56:57.979 --> 01:56:58.960]  This is a lie.
[01:56:59.479 --> 01:57:03.760]  If you want news, go to CBS's John Dickerson or maybe the Wall Street Journal.
[01:57:04.659 --> 01:57:22.819]  Investigations by The Wall Street Journal and researchers at Stanford University and the University of Massachusetts Amherst have found that Instagram helps connect and promote a vast network of accounts openly devoted to the commission and purchase of underage sex content.
[01:57:23.039 --> 01:57:33.159]  These pedophilic accounts are brazen about their interest, using hashtags like pedohore and preteensex to search for sellers of child sex material.
[01:57:33.979 --> 01:57:40.119]  And seller accounts often claim to be run by children themselves and use overtly sexual handles.
[01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:54.789]  Meanwhile, a slew of self-anointed champions of the propaganda movement that, quote, debunked Pizzagate or investigated child sex crimes Are facing or have faced child sex crime charges.
[01:57:55.069 --> 01:58:11.850]  Front and center, James Gordon Meek, a high-profile Emmy Award-winning investigative journalist with ABC News and the New York Daily News, and also held a position as a senior counterterrorism advisor and investigator for the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security,
[01:58:12.130 --> 01:58:14.430]  had, quote, debunked Pizzagate.
[01:58:14.529 --> 01:58:24.270]  Yet Meek was in possession of thousands of child sex abuse media dating back to 2014, including a video of the rape of an infant female.
[01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:36.010]  Meek also networked with other pedophiles and in court admitted to transporting and possessing child sexual abuse material and now faces a sentence ranging from 5 to 20 years.
[01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:39.770]  Then there is the hypocrisy of Peter Bright, a.k.a.
[01:58:40.050 --> 01:58:49.850]  Dr. Pizza, a left-wing Ars Technica journalist that mocked Pizzagate truthers in 2018 while dubbing himself at Dr. Pizza on Twitter.
[01:58:50.130 --> 01:59:10.979]  Bright was arrested by an FBI sting after an undercover agent posing as a mother arranging A sexual encounter between Bright and her children who were ages 7 and 9. During the trial, the defense argued that Bright was under the impression that he and the FBI agent were engaged in age play and that the children were in fact consenting adults.
[01:59:10.979 --> 01:59:28.539]  That trial ended in a hung jury in 2020. And back in 2017 in Australia, investigative journalist Ben McCormick, who had made a name for himself confronting an Australian television star over child sex allegations, which led to Robert Hughes being sentenced to six years in prison.
[01:59:28.699 --> 01:59:30.760]  Throughout the trial, he'd shown little emotion.
[01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:37.439]  But right at the end, when the verdicts were being read out, he started to cry and he yelled out to the jury, I am innocent.
[01:59:37.899 --> 01:59:42.479]  He's shown no remorse and taken no responsibility for his horrendous crimes.
[01:59:42.699 --> 01:59:45.979]  But tonight, he's behind bars awaiting sentencing.
[01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:51.140]  Well, Ben McCormick was later sentenced to prison himself for child porn offenses.
[01:59:51.420 --> 02:00:01.199]  These examples only scrape the surface into an international billion-dollar child trafficking ring that includes the Biden administration and the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:12.380]  There was a witness, a whistleblower, who said that U.S. federal government has essentially become a middleman in a multi-billion dollar human trafficking operation targeting unaccompanied minors at the southern border.
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:24.840]  But when U.S. Customs and Border Protection encounters 435 unaccompanied minors per day, drug cartels and traffickers exploiting 60% of these children in prostitution, forced labor, and child pornography...
[02:00:24.859 --> 02:00:26.039]  So where are we now?
[02:00:26.220 --> 02:00:31.319]  Well, the facade of those that doth protest too much has been destroyed.
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:37.979]  We are now in a hyper-spiritual war on this plane of existence with powers we can barely imagine.
[02:00:38.119 --> 02:00:39.659]  Hunter laptop from hell.
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:40.880]  What's on that?
[02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:42.119]  It's from hell?
[02:00:42.359 --> 02:00:44.640]  Well, I have a good idea what's on that.
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:45.899]  And it's pretty bad.
[02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:50.000]  Can we love God's children more than we fear evil?
[02:00:50.359 --> 02:00:58.380]  My brothers and sisters, can we love Jesus I don't know about the last, but definitely the most effective.
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:02.319]  And that's because all of your support is the crew.
[02:01:02.859 --> 02:01:06.760]  And of course, God working through you is not number one.
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:07.319]  It's everything.
[02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:08.840]  All right.
[02:01:11.399 --> 02:01:20.199]  Victor Boot was supposed to be on today about the Russia escalation war stuff, but he got stuck in transit coming back into Russia.
[02:01:20.279 --> 02:01:22.039]  So he's going to be on tomorrow.
[02:01:22.819 --> 02:01:25.380]  Also, Dr. Peter McCullough and Dr. Judy Mikovits.
[02:01:25.779 --> 02:01:27.899]  So it's going to be one hell of a transmission tomorrow.
[02:01:29.539 --> 02:01:30.979]  If we're here, you never know.
[02:01:31.159 --> 02:01:32.300]  So much is going on.
[02:01:32.739 --> 02:01:37.880]  Had the feds illegally tried to shut us twice in the last six months, once three weeks ago.
[02:01:39.479 --> 02:01:48.479]  I'm going to be in federal court on Monday for the evidentiary hearing about the fraudulent sale of InfoWars to Michael Bloomberg's group.
[02:01:49.319 --> 02:01:50.619]  And they're in a lot of trouble.
[02:01:50.859 --> 02:01:59.939]  I mean, even outside top lawyers that have looked at the lawsuit filings in the documents say they don't see how these people don't get indicted.
[02:02:01.039 --> 02:02:03.319]  You're at Barnes yesterday, and he never talks like that.
[02:02:03.359 --> 02:02:04.380]  He said, this is open and shut up.
[02:02:04.979 --> 02:02:05.659]  Bankruptcy fraud.
[02:02:05.859 --> 02:02:13.159]  I mean, we put in our lawsuits, and so did the Real better than one that they cheated U.S. code.
[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:20.739]  And talking to their lawyer, he's very respected, but he said he's never done that in his 45 years of practicing law to a U.S. trustee.
[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:26.560]  So, I mean, let me get to the other news.
[02:02:26.699 --> 02:02:34.359]  It's just, they gave one set of auction rules to everybody else, and then another set of rules to the people they chose as the winner.
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:36.380]  I mean, that right there, illegal bid rigging.
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:45.539]  And we're dumb enough to memorialize it and have documents to the court.
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:46.880]  Well, we just made...
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:50.939]  It's our business decision that no one else can use credit, but they can.
[02:02:53.859 --> 02:02:55.239]  And we didn't tell...
[02:02:55.239 --> 02:02:57.800]  And we told the other bidders, you can't use credit.
[02:02:58.479 --> 02:03:02.439]  And you can't offer them a piece of the business in the future to act magnanimous.
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:03.699]  Because the owner...
[02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:09.779]  The company that I was going to work with that was bidding to buy it, I was like, Alex, I want to be nice.
[02:03:10.939 --> 02:03:16.800]  Would you work for me if I gave them 5-10% of the future earnings?
[02:03:16.899 --> 02:03:18.460]  And I said, you don't understand.
[02:03:18.539 --> 02:03:23.000]  This is the Justice Department and the CIA. They're going to get it regardless.
[02:03:25.319 --> 02:03:26.859]  According to the rules, they wouldn't even tell me what they were bidding.
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:27.680]  They followed all the rules.
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:29.520]  But I said, yeah, that's fine with me.
[02:03:29.539 --> 02:03:30.399]  I don't care about the money.
[02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:31.579]  I care about fighting the tyrants.
[02:03:33.489 --> 02:03:37.710]  But then they're told, no, you can't do that by the U.S. trustee.
[02:03:37.909 --> 02:03:41.090]  You can't offer them any money.
[02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:47.270]  And they gave them specific rules saying they couldn't.
[02:03:47.489 --> 02:03:49.609]  And then let the other people do it.
[02:03:49.689 --> 02:03:51.109]  But it wasn't even real money.
[02:03:51.229 --> 02:03:54.050]  It was pledging my future earnings as the money.
[02:03:55.770 --> 02:04:02.569]  It gets so much crazier that people reading it, because these are public documents, cannot believe it.
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:09.800]  I mean, it's such fantastical fraud that it's cartoon level.
[02:04:09.979 --> 02:04:11.439]  It's bonker town.
[02:04:13.420 --> 02:04:17.659]  But you saw them on Good Morning America, their interview in the Bloomberg group.
[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:19.600]  Oh, we really own the onion.
[02:04:19.779 --> 02:04:20.880]  We're going to get Alex Jones.
[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:21.579]  We're every town.
[02:04:21.739 --> 02:04:22.640]  Bloomberg funds us.
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:23.220]  Ha ha ha.
[02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:25.300]  He funds like 97% of it.
[02:04:26.100 --> 02:04:27.199]  They go and...
[02:04:29.710 --> 02:04:32.729]  Stephanopoulos says, well, how did you pay a lower bid?
[02:04:32.930 --> 02:04:34.149]  That doesn't sound like a real auction.
[02:04:35.409 --> 02:04:37.649]  And they go, it's Alex Jones!
[02:04:38.050 --> 02:04:40.170]  It's like, come on!
[02:04:40.369 --> 02:04:41.569]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:04:41.649 --> 02:04:42.590]  We can do whatever we want!
[02:04:43.029 --> 02:04:44.090]  Come on!
[02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:45.229]  It's Donald Trump!
[02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:52.270]  That crazy woman says, literal crazy leftist cat lady.
[02:04:52.390 --> 02:05:03.199]  I'm going to scale a 1 to 10. She's an 11. Jean Carroll says, I don't remember exactly what year, but I was in the changing stall that didn't even have doors on it, and he walked up and grabbed my vagina.
[02:05:03.779 --> 02:05:05.100]  Trump says, that's crazy.
[02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:06.140]  I never met that woman.
[02:05:06.319 --> 02:05:07.020]  I'd never do that.
[02:05:09.819 --> 02:05:11.199]  Oh, defamation!
[02:05:12.319 --> 02:05:13.600]  Then he said he was innocent again.
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:14.560]  Defamation again.
[02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:17.819]  How do you not say you're innocent?
[02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:19.819]  I mean, even if you're not innocent, you're allowed to, right?
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:20.699]  No.
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:23.319]  You are not allowed to say you're innocent.
[02:05:24.189 --> 02:05:29.529]  I was told that in Texas and Connecticut in the trials, where the judges already found me guilty.
[02:05:29.630 --> 02:05:43.689]  They gave us printed orders in both places, scripted by HBO. And I knew it was scripted, but when I was in Connecticut after I met in Texas a month later, they had scheduled them for the extravaganza.
[02:05:46.189 --> 02:05:53.909]  And I remember looking over when I was testifying on the judge's notes, and then I was looking over, and I have a really good memory of notes and documents, and I'm kind of, she sees me looking, it's kind of, hmm.
[02:05:55.520 --> 02:05:57.119]  Judge Bellis kind of puts a little sheet over it.
[02:05:57.260 --> 02:05:58.619]  I was like, that's the same damn no.
[02:05:58.739 --> 02:05:59.579]  It's about rules for me.
[02:06:00.159 --> 02:06:02.439]  And I saw that in Texas.
[02:06:02.779 --> 02:06:05.220]  I was like, what?
[02:06:06.439 --> 02:06:12.500]  And then I kind of got freaked out for a minute because I wasn't really listening when the guy was asking idiotic questions.
[02:06:13.039 --> 02:06:14.920]  And they were like arguing about rules or something.
[02:06:15.039 --> 02:06:16.319]  I was just kind of tuning out, looking over.
[02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:17.479]  Actually, I was sitting here.
[02:06:17.579 --> 02:06:18.039]  I was looking this way.
[02:06:19.699 --> 02:06:21.640]  And all of a sudden, I went like, what?
[02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:28.180]  And the head lawyer, Koskoff, saw me for the first time, look upset, and he went like, like a wolf.
[02:06:28.359 --> 02:06:28.979]  Like, why is he?
[02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:34.180]  He's like, he's smiling, because I was like going, God, he's completely rigged.
[02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:35.899]  They've got a script.
[02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:38.180]  I was like, what the hell?
[02:06:38.539 --> 02:06:41.800]  This is an actual Shakespeare, like actual play.
[02:06:43.619 --> 02:06:46.000]  I mean, the magnitude of that.
[02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:51.939]  But again, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:53.409 --> 02:06:55.590]  We can do whatever we want to him.
[02:06:56.109 --> 02:07:05.250]  And we can script this and have a big show trial and get up and go, he sent the people to my house and they attacked me and they were mean.
[02:07:05.489 --> 02:07:07.369]  Well, did you call the police as a report?
[02:07:07.710 --> 02:07:08.069]  No.
[02:07:08.750 --> 02:07:10.409]  Did you ever see Alex say do that?
[02:07:10.550 --> 02:07:10.750]  No.
[02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:12.609]  Well, who peed on the graves?
[02:07:12.789 --> 02:07:13.149]  I don't know.
[02:07:13.310 --> 02:07:14.050]  I heard somebody told me.
[02:07:14.130 --> 02:07:14.510]  Who told you?
[02:07:14.569 --> 02:07:15.170]  I don't remember.
[02:07:18.130 --> 02:07:19.010]  Pee on the grave.
[02:07:19.130 --> 02:07:20.569]  I mean, just, you know, it's...
[02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:26.640]  Jones stormed in the office screaming at employees.
[02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:33.359]  He looked at the fish tank of the fish named Wilbur and he reached in and ate it and said, I don't want fish in here.
[02:07:33.779 --> 02:07:35.119]  There's never been a fish here.
[02:07:36.939 --> 02:07:42.899]  But they put it in the New York Times because they know you're already pre-programmed with it because you saw Wolf of Wall Street.
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:46.880]  Your brain hears that and thinks it's true because you've seen someone do it before.
[02:07:47.159 --> 02:07:48.020]  That's programming.
[02:07:50.500 --> 02:07:55.500]  That's the level of these people coming up with new lies and how to con you.
[02:07:59.399 --> 02:08:03.699]  They're trying to apply their fiction onto humanity and get us to accept their fiction.
[02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:05.840]  All right, so Victor Boot couldn't be here.
[02:08:05.899 --> 02:08:10.079]  And that's not a bad thing because he's a big guest.
[02:08:10.100 --> 02:08:12.619]  I want to talk about World War III, but I've already talked about that so much.
[02:08:12.819 --> 02:08:14.699]  And there is new developments that will be on tomorrow.
[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:16.479]  But I was like, man, I didn't get to...
[02:08:19.739 --> 02:08:25.000]  All of these other stacks, and I didn't get to new developments on the poison shots that just came out.
[02:08:25.659 --> 02:08:31.899]  So I was sitting there right before I went to break, before they came in and told me that boot wasn't on today, thinking, man, I wish I had time to cover this.
[02:08:32.060 --> 02:08:34.039]  This is even worse than I thought about Hotez.
[02:08:34.399 --> 02:08:41.460]  You saw the interview with him doing the Fauci thing of, oh, look out, boy, Trump's about to get hit with a bunch of viruses and smiling like a damn gremlin.
[02:08:43.939 --> 02:08:44.779]  Not like a gremlin.
[02:08:44.899 --> 02:08:45.800]  He is an obvious gremlin.
[02:08:46.100 --> 02:08:49.180]  In fact, he makes gremlins look sweet if they did exist.
[02:08:49.619 --> 02:08:51.979]  He's what, I guess, you get the archetype of gremlins from.
[02:08:53.319 --> 02:08:54.880]  Renfield, Dracula's servant.
[02:08:55.500 --> 02:08:59.340]  That's really, he's a Renfilian character, archetype.
[02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:02.659]  And then I actually got the Houston Chronicle interview with him.
[02:09:03.239 --> 02:09:05.340]  Boy, that's even wilder.
[02:09:05.460 --> 02:09:06.399]  I mean, we're talking.
[02:09:06.939 --> 02:09:07.640]  Woo, baby!
[02:09:08.579 --> 02:09:10.119]  He went further than Fauci.
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:11.880]  Oh, don't worry.
[02:09:12.020 --> 02:09:13.699]  There'll be a new pandemic right away.
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:14.800]  We'll be in control.
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:18.319]  We're going to get to that coming up.
[02:09:23.460 --> 02:09:25.640]  Maybe I'll just start talking like Fauci all the time.
[02:09:28.199 --> 02:09:31.100]  Oh, my God.
[02:09:33.319 --> 02:09:35.180]  So I got a lot of news here.
[02:09:36.399 --> 02:09:37.800]  And so I'm going to be a good boy.
[02:09:44.229 --> 02:09:49.630]  And then I'm going to go into the fourth hour with a special guest.
[02:09:49.770 --> 02:09:50.529]  A lot of breaking news.
[02:09:50.630 --> 02:09:51.050]  We're getting ready.
[02:09:53.010 --> 02:09:56.369]  And I'm sure everybody likes me to cover whatever the latest pop news is.
[02:09:56.550 --> 02:10:05.489]  You got this UnitedHealthcare CEO this morning with a man in a black ski mask, execution style, shooting him a couple times in the chest and running off.
[02:10:06.449 --> 02:10:08.390]  And they're saying it looks like a hit.
[02:10:08.710 --> 02:10:09.149]  Yeah.
[02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.670]  Yeah.
[02:10:10.789 --> 02:10:14.010]  This is what corporations have always done, but it's been heating up.
[02:10:14.090 --> 02:10:20.510]  You have like the Boeing whistleblowers dying of those overnight colds that kill you.
[02:10:21.369 --> 02:10:23.850]  But what am I supposed to do?
[02:10:23.989 --> 02:10:24.869]  We don't know why.
[02:10:24.989 --> 02:10:26.109]  We don't know exactly who.
[02:10:27.770 --> 02:10:28.949]  It's small potatoes.
[02:10:32.039 --> 02:10:36.340]  The globalist hyping that they're going to hit Trump with a new virus to take control.
[02:10:36.539 --> 02:10:44.880]  So war with Russia, domestic uprisings, new virus, cyber attack could go with any of those, power outages.
[02:10:45.140 --> 02:10:48.159]  I mean, they got it rolling out right now.
[02:10:48.319 --> 02:10:59.279]  So again, I could talk all day about, well, will it be this defense secretary or that defense secretary?
[02:11:03.340 --> 02:11:04.180]  Window drapes.
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:07.920]  I'm talking about the structure of the building.
[02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:09.520]  The big kahuna.
[02:11:09.779 --> 02:11:12.140]  The skeleton.
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:13.720]  The brain.
[02:11:13.979 --> 02:11:14.680]  The guts.
[02:11:14.819 --> 02:11:15.199]  The mind.
[02:11:15.399 --> 02:11:15.760]  The blood.
[02:11:17.939 --> 02:11:20.680]  Not the sunglasses that the body's wearing.
[02:11:21.079 --> 02:11:22.199]  Or the suit.
[02:11:23.279 --> 02:11:25.279]  But the very sinew.
[02:11:26.699 --> 02:11:28.840]  The very heart of the matter.
[02:11:29.730 --> 02:11:30.869]  That's what we do.
[02:11:31.050 --> 02:11:33.329]  And I don't say that to go, oh look, we do a great job.
[02:11:33.569 --> 02:11:36.270]  Oh look, I'm the one giving you the hardcore stuff.
[02:11:36.409 --> 02:11:47.609]  No, it's that we have to stop as a culture chasing every rabbit trail that's out there and sit back and say, what is front and center?
[02:11:53.170 --> 02:11:55.250]  What's coming down the pike right at you?
[02:11:56.930 --> 02:11:57.989]  What's the lead elephant?
[02:11:59.250 --> 02:12:00.270]  What's the enemy plan?
[02:12:01.550 --> 02:12:10.050]  Instead of reacting to their plan once it's launched, and then reacting to all the little small horseflies.
[02:12:10.869 --> 02:12:15.850]  I mean, if you've got a big giant goblin creature attacking you, you've got to deal with it.
[02:12:16.470 --> 02:12:18.470]  Now, maybe you've got horseflies biting you and stuff.
[02:12:18.489 --> 02:12:20.609]  They don't feel good, but you've just got to ignore the horseflies.
[02:12:21.689 --> 02:12:24.210]  Because while you're slapping that horsefly that's biting you on the head...
[02:12:25.489 --> 02:12:28.390]  That goblin is going to come crashing down on you with his club.
[02:12:28.390 --> 02:12:30.930]  Now, in the real world, it's actually his little horse slice coming.
[02:12:31.050 --> 02:12:33.270]  Little loving mosquitoes released by Bill Gates.
[02:12:33.470 --> 02:12:34.350]  Oh, hi!
[02:12:36.189 --> 02:12:42.310]  All right, let's start getting into it here.
[02:12:44.529 --> 02:12:47.710]  I covered the surface of the transgender news.
[02:12:48.659 --> 02:12:51.880]  But I want to drill into this right now because a lot's happening on this front.
[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:52.819]  This is key to everything.
[02:12:53.399 --> 02:12:54.539]  We'll do that in just a moment.
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:58.239]  But first, remember, I'm in a war fighting for you.
[02:13:00.380 --> 02:13:05.720]  Because if I'm not living in a free country, you're not living in a free country.
[02:13:05.819 --> 02:13:06.899]  See, we're all in it together.
[02:13:06.899 --> 02:13:17.289]  And I know you know that, but let it really be first and foremost that We all hang together, as Benjamin Franklin said, or we hang separate.
[02:13:17.949 --> 02:13:19.569]  Here's a clip, and I'll be right back with the news.
[02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:26.890]  My dad is chemistry background, also a retired doctor, but he came in to help me run my supplement division 13 years ago.
[02:13:27.369 --> 02:13:28.710]  The deep state sued the hell out of him.
[02:13:28.829 --> 02:13:30.149]  We're going to our guest in a moment, but I got to do this.
[02:13:30.210 --> 02:13:30.569]  Thank you, sir.
[02:13:31.090 --> 02:13:34.750]  And they basically almost destroyed my parents.
[02:13:34.829 --> 02:13:37.689]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family members.
[02:13:37.729 --> 02:13:41.289]  That my dad was at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits the Democrats filed.
[02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:45.289]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are $316 million yesterday.
[02:13:45.670 --> 02:13:48.250]  They filed before they spent $80 million suing me.
[02:13:48.430 --> 02:13:50.050]  We spent $16 million fighting them.
[02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:51.949]  My dad spent $2 million fighting them.
[02:13:52.010 --> 02:13:53.090]  And we're finally winning.
[02:13:53.359 --> 02:14:04.619]  Not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnaturals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request I ask you to support him because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[02:14:04.819 --> 02:14:14.800]  He was giving everything to InfoWars and then personally going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me because that's how dads are.
[02:14:15.199 --> 02:14:16.340]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[02:14:16.479 --> 02:14:22.600]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office and I got pissed.
[02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:30.310]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day, and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[02:14:30.750 --> 02:14:32.029]  The supplements are there.
[02:14:32.189 --> 02:14:32.810]  They're great.
[02:14:32.989 --> 02:14:34.170]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[02:14:34.229 --> 02:14:35.109]  He's put everything into it.
[02:14:35.130 --> 02:14:35.529]  He has.
[02:14:35.630 --> 02:14:36.189]  They're incredible.
[02:14:36.449 --> 02:14:46.130]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, that I don't want to belabor this.
[02:14:46.170 --> 02:14:47.449]  We have important topics to cover.
[02:14:48.270 --> 02:14:49.529]  Please support us.
[02:14:49.710 --> 02:14:51.729]  Go to drjonesadgrills.com.
[02:14:51.810 --> 02:14:52.529]  There's a new sale.
[02:14:52.829 --> 02:14:54.229]  Everything is 30% off.

[02:15:04.010 --> 02:15:06.250]  Or try these other amazing products.
[02:15:06.550 --> 02:15:10.390]  Ultimate Longevity Pack for 50% off a big sale.
[02:15:10.569 --> 02:15:17.689]  And my dad literally took a loan last week to be able to buy the product that's coming in finally today.
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:20.579]  Next week, turbo force, things like that that are popular.
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:23.279]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:27.760]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[02:15:28.100 --> 02:15:29.439]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:30.199]  He's a fighter.
[02:15:30.319 --> 02:15:31.159]  Hell, he is my dad.
[02:15:31.319 --> 02:15:32.279]  I think I'm a fighter.
[02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:33.899]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[02:15:34.590 --> 02:15:42.109]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[02:15:42.289 --> 02:15:44.970]  But at this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:45.090 --> 02:15:46.029]  It's about my parents.
[02:15:46.630 --> 02:15:52.130]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's why the enemy targeted them.
[02:15:52.609 --> 02:15:55.649]  So, please support the info war today.
[02:15:55.909 --> 02:15:57.750]  Support my mother and my father.
[02:15:57.789 --> 02:16:00.729]  I'm asking you personally for you to do it now.
[02:16:00.949 --> 02:16:03.630]  And at 5% of the millions watching, we go do it.
[02:16:03.750 --> 02:16:05.470]  All our problems will be over in one minute.
[02:16:05.529 --> 02:16:11.109]  But it's less than one half, one percent to ever buy anything from drjonesnagros.com, thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:16:11.210 --> 02:16:14.750]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight for our futures.
[02:16:15.149 --> 02:16:18.409]  So, thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnagros.com.
[02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:20.029]  I'm going to shut up at the balance of this hour.
[02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:23.970]  And I'm going to shut up on the plugging now.
[02:16:24.329 --> 02:16:24.569]  Okay.
[02:16:28.909 --> 02:16:40.069]  Analysts are saying, and I tend to agree with them, knowing the makeup of the court, that the Supreme Court that was sharing arguments today is likely to uphold a ban on gender-affirming care.
[02:16:40.309 --> 02:16:41.270]  Look at that headline.
[02:16:41.430 --> 02:16:45.270]  I mean, just this alone is a lesson in deceptive propaganda.
[02:16:47.070 --> 02:16:48.510]  Gender-affirming care.
[02:16:48.729 --> 02:16:51.729]  Brainwashing children secretly in the public and private schools.
[02:16:52.209 --> 02:16:54.450]  Private schools are just as bad or worse.
[02:16:54.790 --> 02:17:08.209]  Not all of them, but statistically, because they get grants from government and private groups to literally not let you know what's going on with your young children as they induct them into this cult and then turn the kids with psychological warfare techniques against the parents.
[02:17:08.430 --> 02:17:14.729]  And then when they start them on the chemicals or then actually mutilate them with surgery, it's called gender-affirming care.
[02:17:14.729 --> 02:17:15.610]  It's care.
[02:17:16.770 --> 02:17:17.969]  We cut your breast off.
[02:17:18.069 --> 02:17:19.069]  We cut your uterus out.
[02:17:19.170 --> 02:17:20.790]  We cut your penis and testicles off.
[02:17:20.969 --> 02:17:21.930]  It's care.
[02:17:22.809 --> 02:17:25.569]  No, it's worse than raping a child.
[02:17:25.770 --> 02:17:28.549]  Because that's terrible and affects them their whole life.
[02:17:29.209 --> 02:17:35.829]  But actually cutting their genitals off is taking, I call it satanic philia.
[02:17:36.590 --> 02:17:38.690]  Pedo sacrifice philia.
[02:17:39.539 --> 02:17:39.899]  Pedophilia.
[02:17:39.899 --> 02:17:41.299]  They want to give them poison shots.
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:42.700]  They want to abort them before they're born.
[02:17:42.959 --> 02:17:46.079]  They want to give them GMO. They want to give them all this poison garbage.
[02:17:46.219 --> 02:17:48.020]  They want to cut them up.
[02:17:48.459 --> 02:17:49.459]  It's just hiding it.
[02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:50.540]  But oh, it's the loving.
[02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:51.260]  It's liberal.
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:52.139]  Come on!
[02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:55.920]  And you've got the kids being targeted.
[02:17:56.059 --> 02:18:00.579]  You've got the sicko-leptist parents that want to drop the kid out and be popular and up their social credit score.
[02:18:01.670 --> 02:18:04.549]  You got the hospitals and medical workers that just want to get rich.
[02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:09.329]  But at the top of it, Tavistock Institute, MI6, CIA, look it up.
[02:18:09.510 --> 02:18:10.989]  It's a plan to break down society.
[02:18:11.329 --> 02:18:15.510]  Because if you put up with that in men and women's bathrooms and all the rest of it, you'll put up with anything.
[02:18:15.790 --> 02:18:16.950]  It's a litmus test.
[02:18:18.270 --> 02:18:19.569]  It's human sacrifice.
[02:18:21.250 --> 02:18:21.610]  Light.
[02:18:23.569 --> 02:18:24.889]  But it's not light, is it?
[02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:31.129]  And then when they commit suicide at the highest rates, oh, you didn't accept them and celebrate it.
[02:18:31.229 --> 02:18:37.530]  That's why they're the highest group to be in the sex trade and to commit suicide and to be depressed and to commit crimes.
[02:18:38.569 --> 02:18:40.450]  Because there are whack jobs, many of them.
[02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:41.690]  I don't hate these people.
[02:18:41.829 --> 02:18:43.950]  I'm nice to these people that are victims of it.
[02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:48.209]  But I don't endorse the cult and the targeting of the children.
[02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:50.049]  Big difference.
[02:18:51.409 --> 02:18:54.270]  And I hate the establishment that's doing it.
[02:18:55.510 --> 02:19:00.229]  Supreme Court is now hearing challenged a ban on transgender healthcare for minors.
[02:19:01.270 --> 02:19:06.709]  And then I happened to be watching CNN yesterday when I got off air eating lunch to monitor the enemy.
[02:19:06.829 --> 02:19:07.930]  I actually saw this live.
[02:19:08.129 --> 02:19:09.850]  I meant to tell the crew to get it, but I didn't.
[02:19:09.909 --> 02:19:11.450]  But I noticed it was on X this morning, trending.
[02:19:12.229 --> 02:19:14.170]  They had the transgender lawyer.
[02:19:14.809 --> 02:19:17.649]  And I missed the part where they announced that it's a woman to man.
[02:19:17.870 --> 02:19:19.450]  But I could tell it was a woman.
[02:19:20.850 --> 02:19:22.870]  And this is the cult.
[02:19:24.309 --> 02:19:25.469]  And they want your kids.
[02:19:25.770 --> 02:19:27.850]  They want to form a relationship with them secretly.
[02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:29.469]  Use psychological warfare tactics.
[02:19:29.709 --> 02:19:30.870]  Take them away from you.
[02:19:32.430 --> 02:19:34.090]  And say, be nice to me.
[02:19:34.110 --> 02:19:36.170]  I just want a relationship with your kids.
[02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:38.569]  I want to abort them.
[02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:39.590]  I want to give them shots.
[02:19:39.629 --> 02:19:41.229]  I want to cut the pee-pees off.
[02:19:42.129 --> 02:19:44.190]  I want to cut little girls' breasts off.
[02:19:44.290 --> 02:19:44.930]  Isn't that nice?
[02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:45.709]  That's liberal.
[02:19:46.370 --> 02:19:47.590]  That's so liberal.
[02:19:49.329 --> 02:19:50.389]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[02:19:52.159 --> 02:19:53.079]  Big studies out.
[02:19:53.780 --> 02:19:56.420]  Most gender-confused children grow out of it.
[02:19:56.500 --> 02:19:57.219]  That's the point.
[02:19:57.479 --> 02:19:59.920]  Grow out of it, you mean most of them break out of the cult?
[02:20:00.319 --> 02:20:06.799]  Landmark 15-year study concludes, as critics say, it shows big trans is usually just a phase for kids.
[02:20:06.979 --> 02:20:08.780]  That's how conservatives counter it.
[02:20:08.819 --> 02:20:11.659]  Well, we know you love the kids, but you're wrong about it.
[02:20:11.700 --> 02:20:12.540]  You made a mistake.
[02:20:12.799 --> 02:20:15.040]  Not this is a total takedown of society weapon.
[02:20:15.799 --> 02:20:17.680]  And total evil hiding in plain view.
[02:20:23.729 --> 02:20:24.989]  Let's get into this first, though.
[02:20:26.290 --> 02:20:27.709]  Hello, lovely lady.
[02:20:28.510 --> 02:20:34.850]  And it's men that say they're women and they almost universally are obsessed with recruiting other kids.
[02:20:35.069 --> 02:20:36.510]  They are school teachers.
[02:20:40.770 --> 02:20:44.170]  And they are going to teach your children their ways.
[02:20:44.329 --> 02:20:45.069]  They're going to groom.
[02:20:45.329 --> 02:20:46.149]  They're going to recruit.
[02:20:48.430 --> 02:20:49.930]  It's so much fun!
[02:20:50.149 --> 02:20:52.229]  And they love Pfizer, too.
[02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:57.770]  And they love seed oils and 5G. And they want to eat the bugs.
[02:20:57.969 --> 02:20:59.989]  They're the friendlies of the establishment.
[02:21:00.250 --> 02:21:01.870]  They join the team.
[02:21:02.549 --> 02:21:04.430]  They cut their peepees off.
[02:21:04.629 --> 02:21:08.010]  They're good little slaves, and now they're going to help your child do it.
[02:21:08.629 --> 02:21:12.010]  They're the zombie army of the New World Order.
[02:21:13.270 --> 02:21:14.270]  Remember this clip?
[02:21:14.409 --> 02:21:15.170]  Because this is the case.
[02:21:16.409 --> 02:21:20.149]  They found out in Tennessee that they weren't telling parents.
[02:21:20.149 --> 02:21:21.389]  They were bringing them into the system.
[02:21:21.409 --> 02:21:22.409]  They were sterilizing them.
[02:21:22.489 --> 02:21:23.250]  It was totally illegal.
[02:21:23.450 --> 02:21:26.069]  And so the state passed another law saying you can't do that.
[02:21:27.610 --> 02:21:30.950]  And then they caught the heads of the institution saying we're going to make all this money.
[02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:32.590]  We make millions off these people.
[02:21:32.989 --> 02:21:34.829]  And it gets taxpayer paid for.
[02:21:36.610 --> 02:21:42.250]  Vanderbilt Health is gender bending Tennessee minors without parental consent.
[02:21:42.569 --> 02:21:43.729]  The Federalists.
[02:21:45.909 --> 02:21:50.409]  The bill followed a September 2022 investigation into Vanderbilt University.
[02:21:51.170 --> 02:21:54.409]  We're gonna get into that when we come back and play clips.
[02:21:56.889 --> 02:22:00.430]  Yeah, it's time to end the mutilation of children.
[02:22:04.530 --> 02:22:06.270]  See, it's all or nothing for these people.
[02:22:06.350 --> 02:22:13.549]  They gotta do the most wild, crazy, evil stuff and bully you and censor you and attack you into shutting up about it.
[02:22:16.270 --> 02:22:19.209]  Hey, just accept Bruce Jenner is now Caitlyn Jenner.
[02:22:19.350 --> 02:22:21.069]  You're like, okay, guy, let's be a woman.
[02:22:21.149 --> 02:22:21.649]  I don't hate him.
[02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:24.790]  Oh, just accept gay marriage one day later.
[02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:25.790]  Let us have exes to your children.
[02:22:25.909 --> 02:22:26.930]  Let us cut their penises off.
[02:22:29.829 --> 02:22:33.489]  Hey, just accept the Wachowski brothers that made the Matrix.
[02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:34.590]  They're both women now.
[02:22:34.709 --> 02:22:35.870]  Do you accept them?
[02:22:35.950 --> 02:22:36.809]  You're not against them, are you?
[02:22:38.309 --> 02:22:40.389]  I would have reporters like for Vanity Fair, you name it.
[02:22:40.649 --> 02:22:41.389]  Esquire asked me that.
[02:22:41.450 --> 02:22:42.430]  I'm like, I don't dislike them.
[02:22:42.549 --> 02:22:44.329]  And I understood what was going on 10 years ago.
[02:22:44.370 --> 02:22:47.530]  But I'm like, well, I don't hate the people that have done it as adults.
[02:22:47.969 --> 02:22:48.729]  It's like, oh, good.
[02:22:48.809 --> 02:22:49.770]  Then you accept it for everybody.
[02:22:51.329 --> 02:22:52.409]  No, I didn't say that.
[02:22:52.690 --> 02:22:55.129]  Yes, we're going to talk to your children without you being there.
[02:22:56.569 --> 02:22:58.489]  It's so wonderful now.
[02:23:01.049 --> 02:23:02.309]  So we're going to get to all of that.
[02:23:03.209 --> 02:23:04.409]  The new Hotez news.
[02:23:05.930 --> 02:23:09.049]  They're planning to pull the rug out for under Trump with the economy that's already started.
[02:23:10.030 --> 02:23:11.430]  Attacks on Elon Musk.
[02:23:12.549 --> 02:23:15.590]  Russia banning imports of US GMO garbage.
[02:23:16.729 --> 02:23:17.950]  And so much more.
[02:23:18.309 --> 02:23:20.090]  We also have Cancel Me!
[02:23:20.170 --> 02:23:22.809]  New York City Mayor vows to work with Trump on mass deportations.
[02:23:22.989 --> 02:23:24.549]  It's all coming up straight ahead.
[02:23:25.090 --> 02:23:27.530]  We've been through a lot in Infowars.
[02:23:27.729 --> 02:23:30.229]  America and the world has been through hell.
[02:23:30.389 --> 02:23:31.729]  But the great awakening is here.
[02:23:31.950 --> 02:23:33.729]  The globalists are in full panic mode.
[02:23:33.930 --> 02:23:46.479]  And now it's more important than ever to keep the most Powerful, effective voices at exposing the globalist agenda and promoting the team humanity agenda on air.

[02:24:23.319 --> 02:24:26.059]  We have two new campaign coins.

[02:24:28.159 --> 02:24:36.790]  One is the answer to 1984 is 1776. And on one side, it's got the Gadsden flag.
[02:24:36.989 --> 02:24:39.909]  On the other side, it's got yours truly.

[02:24:53.069 --> 02:24:53.510]  Messages.
[02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:54.469]  They weigh a lot.
[02:24:54.549 --> 02:24:55.149]  They feel good.
[02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.950]  They're a great gift.
[02:24:56.149 --> 02:24:57.829]  They're a great memento.
[02:24:57.950 --> 02:24:59.069]  They're a great keepsake.
[02:24:59.190 --> 02:25:01.090]  They're a great conversation starter.
[02:25:01.409 --> 02:25:08.229]  And both these coins are $14.97 at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:25:08.350 --> 02:25:09.750]  We can't do this without you.
[02:25:09.909 --> 02:25:12.389]  We want to sell you products you love so you come back again and again.
[02:25:12.610 --> 02:25:13.909]  Thanks for keeping us in the fight.
[02:25:14.090 --> 02:25:17.930]  Please visit thealexjonesstore.com today and get the campaign coins.
[02:25:30.610 --> 02:25:33.770]  And our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[02:25:34.270 --> 02:25:38.530]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of information.
[02:25:40.399 --> 02:25:45.440]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[02:25:45.559 --> 02:25:48.659]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[02:25:48.879 --> 02:25:51.360]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[02:25:51.559 --> 02:25:54.299]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:25:58.020]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:05.379]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the new world order and BlackRock.
[02:26:05.639 --> 02:26:08.799]  They have declared war on us and we accept the challenge.
[02:26:14.399 --> 02:26:17.819]  AlexJones.network is tomorrow's news today.
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:34.379]  All right, so if you want to know what's at the heart of the Vanderbilt case that the left is, got to the Supreme Court trying to overturn, where Tennessee said, look, we're banning you, sterilizing kids, giving them chemicals, or chopping their body parts off.
[02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:38.760]  They got to make that decision when they're 18. Yeah, can't buy a pack of cigarettes.
[02:26:40.180 --> 02:26:44.840]  Can't get alcohol until you're 21. Can't join the military until you're 18. Can't get loans.
[02:26:45.059 --> 02:26:46.020]  Can't make those decisions.
[02:26:46.260 --> 02:26:52.020]  But the state can secretly, with hospitals, convince you that your parents are wrong and start chopping you up.
[02:26:52.799 --> 02:26:54.920]  So I want to get to the latest developments on that.
[02:26:55.059 --> 02:26:57.680]  But let's just play these Vanderbilt clips back-to-back.
[02:26:58.340 --> 02:27:14.889]  19, 20, and 21. Vanderbilt opened its trans clinic in 2018. During a lecture that same year, Dr. Shane Taylor explained how she convinced Nashville to get into the gender transition game with how much,
[02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:17.389]  quote, big money they'd make and a big moneymaker.
[02:27:18.129 --> 02:27:22.049]  Then goes on to talk about convincing staff or punishing staff that wouldn't get in the cult.
[02:27:22.250 --> 02:27:23.149]  How to bully people.
[02:27:23.309 --> 02:27:26.809]  How to use the Stanford prison experiment to control people.
[02:27:26.989 --> 02:27:27.610]  Mind control.
[02:27:28.489 --> 02:27:31.729]  Vanderbilt unveiled a program called Trans Buddies.
[02:27:32.090 --> 02:27:46.549]  The Buddies are trans actors from the community who attend appointments with the trans patients monitoring the doctors to guard against unsafe behavior such as misgendering and make sure that they keep the kids saying they want to be sterilized without mommy and daddy knowing.
[02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:54.629]  Total grooming, total sex cult, but everybody knows that's illegal and wrong to rape kids, so we don't rape them.
[02:27:54.850 --> 02:27:57.250]  We just cut their penises and breasts off.
[02:27:57.950 --> 02:27:59.850]  We just sterilize them.
[02:28:01.350 --> 02:28:02.629]  Don't be a bully.
[02:28:02.850 --> 02:28:04.469]  Be nice to them.
[02:28:04.969 --> 02:28:11.250]  All these kids are committing suicide because they're under our control, but we're going to blame it on you and make sure you don't say anything.
[02:28:13.409 --> 02:28:15.110]  All right, I'm going to stop doing the Fauci voice.
[02:28:15.250 --> 02:28:15.389]  Sorry.
[02:28:20.270 --> 02:28:25.229]  But it's hard for me and my own voice to say what they're thinking, so I kind of need to choose that.
[02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:27.149]  I've chosen Fauci, I think, as the new voice.
[02:28:33.779 --> 02:28:35.520]  Welcome, seven-year-old.
[02:28:36.079 --> 02:28:39.020]  Your mommy and daddy don't trust you or like you.
[02:28:39.219 --> 02:28:40.200]  I'm your friend.
[02:28:40.700 --> 02:28:42.680]  Don't tell them what we're going to do.
[02:28:42.799 --> 02:28:43.680]  You're special.
[02:28:44.860 --> 02:28:47.299]  You're going to have some new special friends.
[02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:48.579]  You're going to be happy.
[02:28:48.879 --> 02:28:50.739]  You're sad and depressed, aren't you?
[02:28:50.799 --> 02:28:51.739]  Here have some candy.
[02:28:53.219 --> 02:28:58.020]  I used to just pull up in backyards and grab kids out of the back of their playground.
[02:28:58.659 --> 02:29:01.059]  But now I'm here in the school with you.
[02:29:03.629 --> 02:29:05.930]  We're going to give you some special prizes.
[02:29:07.649 --> 02:29:08.750]  Is that a better voice?
[02:29:11.030 --> 02:29:13.969]  Now let me talk to the administrators at the hospital.
[02:29:14.649 --> 02:29:17.709]  You can make five million dollars a year doing this.
[02:29:17.930 --> 02:29:19.129]  It's good for the children.
[02:29:19.569 --> 02:29:22.909]  But if you don't like it, we're going to force you out.
[02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:27.479]  Oh, you're quitting.
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:30.360]  Remember, you have a non-disclosure.
[02:29:30.899 --> 02:29:33.680]  If you tell everyone, we'll sue you.
[02:29:36.159 --> 02:29:42.819]  And now, Your Highness, I wasn't doing a Darth Vader voice, but I guess they've done that, so let me do it actually that way.
[02:29:43.379 --> 02:29:51.540]  And now, Your Highness, we'll discuss the location of your hidden rebel base.
[02:29:57.290 --> 02:29:58.770]  Obi-Wan Kenobi?
[02:29:59.170 --> 02:30:01.069]  Surely he must be dead.
[02:30:01.809 --> 02:30:05.129]  Don't underestimate the power of the Force.
[02:30:06.850 --> 02:30:12.549]  We've got a issue on Selbach.
[02:30:14.809 --> 02:30:27.850]  THX 138. Obi-Wan is here, and the Force is with him.
[02:30:29.770 --> 02:30:32.829]  If this is true, he must not be allowed to escape.
[02:30:34.750 --> 02:30:36.190]  Escape is not his plan.
[02:30:36.510 --> 02:30:38.170]  I must face him alone.
[02:30:39.090 --> 02:30:41.549]  I don't think we're going to do the evil guy voice in Darth Vader.
[02:30:41.729 --> 02:30:43.170]  It doesn't fit.
[02:30:44.049 --> 02:30:46.629]  No, we'll stick with the Fauci voice.
[02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:50.909]  Maybe I can do the globalist voice in Palpatine's voice.
[02:30:53.229 --> 02:30:57.049]  I'm afraid your children belong to us now.
[02:30:57.329 --> 02:30:59.829]  We're going to help them.
[02:31:00.229 --> 02:31:02.590]  And there will be peace.
[02:31:10.850 --> 02:31:15.309]  Go to the Jedi Temple and kill all the younglings.
[02:31:15.690 --> 02:31:23.930]  Only then will you be strong enough in the dark side to save your beloved Pac-Man.
[02:31:26.989 --> 02:31:29.190]  The Jedi are relentless.
[02:31:31.030 --> 02:31:34.809]  They must be wiped out or there will be civil war!
[02:31:35.090 --> 02:31:36.690]  No end!
[02:31:37.309 --> 02:31:41.090]  Do what must be done, Lord Vader!
[02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:43.569]  Show no mercy!
[02:31:59.399 --> 02:32:01.459]  All right, go ahead and show the Vanderbilt scum.
[02:32:01.520 --> 02:32:02.360]  They should all be in prison.
[02:32:02.540 --> 02:32:02.920]  Here it is.
[02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:12.979]  Starting in January 1st of 2017, according to the Affordable Care Act, insurance carriers are mandated to cover medical expenses for trans folks.
[02:32:14.340 --> 02:32:25.909]  Some of our BUMC financial folks in October of 2016, started a couple years ago, put down some The cost of how much money we think each patient would bring in.
[02:32:26.110 --> 02:32:28.069]  And this is only including top surgery.
[02:32:28.190 --> 02:32:29.809]  This doesn't include any bottom surgery.
[02:32:30.489 --> 02:32:32.670]  And it's a lot of money.
[02:32:32.850 --> 02:32:34.270]  These surgeries make a lot of money.
[02:32:35.090 --> 02:32:39.870]  So female to male, chest reconstruction, can bring in $40,000.
[02:32:40.690 --> 02:32:48.870]  A patient just on routine hormone treatment, who I'm only seeing a few times a year, can bring in several thousand dollars because it requires a lot of visits and labs.
[02:32:48.989 --> 02:32:50.750]  It actually makes money for the hospital.
[02:32:51.510 --> 02:33:01.229]  Now, these I got from the internet, but it's from the Philadelphia Center for Transgender Surgery, which does a lot of surgery for patients.
[02:33:01.309 --> 02:33:08.110]  I just wanted to give you an idea of how much these bottom surgeries are making, and I think this has to be an underestimate.
[02:33:08.670 --> 02:33:10.309]  This is for vaginoplasty.
[02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:25.979]  They're saying, they're quoting roughly around $20,000 for imaginoplasty, but that doesn't include your hospital stay, that doesn't include your post-op visits, that doesn't include your anesthesia, your OR, so I would think that this has to be a gross underestimate.
[02:33:26.360 --> 02:33:32.379]  I think that's just like the surgeon's piece of it, which anybody who's ever been to the hospital knows that that's like...
[02:33:34.939 --> 02:33:39.559]  And the female to male bottom surgeries, these are huge money makers.
[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:44.959]  Again, I think this has to be an underestimate that they're voting around $20,000 for a phalloplasty.
[02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:48.200]  There's been different things that I've read that said it could be up to $100,000.
[02:33:49.079 --> 02:33:59.979]  Dr. Winokur, who's our surgeon, says that there's entire clinics where the entire clinic is supported just by their phalloplasties, and that is like a fraction of the surgeries that they're doing.
[02:34:00.290 --> 02:34:07.069]  These surgeries are labor-intensive, they require a lot of follow-ups, they require a lot of over time, and they make money.
[02:34:07.190 --> 02:34:08.190]  They make money for the hospital.
[02:34:08.729 --> 02:34:16.809]  If you are going to assert conscientious objection, you have to realize that that is problematic.
[02:34:17.729 --> 02:34:25.250]  You are doing something to another person, and you are not paying the cost for your belief.
[02:34:25.989 --> 02:34:30.940]  I think that is a real I mean, I think that's a real issue.
[02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:52.399]  So yes, Vanderbilt, if someone has a conscious objection to participating in this sort of surgery, it would probably have to accommodate you to the extent that you can find another person who can do your job who doesn't have an objection,
[02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:54.360]  other things of that nature.
[02:34:54.659 --> 02:35:07.969]  But I just want you to take home That saying that you're not going to do something because of your consciousness, because of your religious beliefs, is not without consequences.
[02:35:08.809 --> 02:35:11.590]  And it should not be without consequences.
[02:35:11.969 --> 02:35:14.930]  And I just want to put that out there.
[02:35:15.209 --> 02:35:17.469]  We are given enormous...
[02:35:17.469 --> 02:35:21.670]  If you don't want to do this kind of work, don't work at Vanderbilt.
[02:35:23.549 --> 02:35:25.149]  It's trans buddy time.
[02:35:25.930 --> 02:35:32.149]  My name is Shawn Riley, and I'm the program coordinator for TransBuddy at the program for LGBTQ health at Vanderbilt University.
[02:35:33.049 --> 02:35:40.190]  TransBuddy provides trained peer advocates for transgender patients who are coming for doctor's appointments or other healthcare related services.
[02:35:40.569 --> 02:35:52.709]  Whether you're looking for something that's related to medical transition, such as hormone therapy, or something completely unrelated, like breaking an arm or going to an ENT, we are here to help support any transgender patients that come through our doors.
[02:35:53.149 --> 02:35:53.709]  TransGroomers.
[02:35:54.209 --> 02:36:01.510]  The Trans Money program was organically created through the efforts of transgender people and continues to consistently be led by trans people in Middle Tennessee.
[02:36:01.750 --> 02:36:03.809]  We used to drive around in ice cream trucks in your neighborhood.
[02:36:04.010 --> 02:36:04.969]  Now we're here in the hospital.
[02:36:05.209 --> 02:36:09.270]  Institutions are looking to Vanderbilt to replicate and expand programs like ours.
[02:36:09.469 --> 02:36:12.690]  We're not seeking to find solutions often for people's problems.
[02:36:12.889 --> 02:36:16.069]  We're just seeking to be there and to accompany and to be a friendly face.
[02:36:16.270 --> 02:36:16.709]  Of course.
[02:36:18.579 --> 02:36:22.000]  And to be a non-medical face...
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.280]  Stick your arm down in the storm drain, Georgie.
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:28.719]  ...a healthcare provider and may be unsafe.
[02:36:28.719 --> 02:36:30.180]  Oh, there's popcorn down here.
[02:36:30.440 --> 02:36:31.440]  Pop, pop, pop.
[02:36:33.100 --> 02:36:34.920]  We're not going to bite the arm off.
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:36.420]  We're going to bite something else off.
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:42.879]  ...interacting with individuals and, again, you know, using correct pronouns or treating the individual with respect.
[02:36:43.940 --> 02:36:45.420]  We're respecting you.
[02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:48.120]  We're going to get that government money, Georgie.
[02:36:50.409 --> 02:36:52.469]  Don't you want your boat, don't you, Georgie?
[02:36:52.610 --> 02:36:53.250]  Stay with me.
[02:36:53.409 --> 02:36:54.690]  Come on down in here.
[02:36:55.389 --> 02:36:55.809]  Good.
[02:36:55.989 --> 02:36:57.889]  No, you don't like your pee-pee's gone.
[02:36:58.049 --> 02:36:59.510]  Well, we'll put you on some drugs.
[02:36:59.670 --> 02:37:00.950]  Oh, you committed suicide.
[02:37:01.809 --> 02:37:03.610]  Well, that's all right, Georgie.
[02:37:04.950 --> 02:37:07.989]  So, let's play...
[02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:28.299]  The clip I've got here, 16, transgender lawyer, as you translate, globalist death cult priest from ACLU who will argue before the Supreme Court today that underage children should be allowed to undergo life-altering surgeries.
[02:37:28.700 --> 02:37:31.899]  You mean, oh, we cut your arm off.
[02:37:31.979 --> 02:37:34.719]  We plucked your eyeball out.
[02:37:34.819 --> 02:37:36.420]  We cut your leg off.
[02:37:37.059 --> 02:37:38.819]  It's gender-affirming.
[02:37:40.379 --> 02:37:42.979]  Oh, we convinced you to cut your breasts off.
[02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:44.000]  Isn't that nice?
[02:37:44.319 --> 02:37:45.959]  You're not in a cult or anything.
[02:37:47.540 --> 02:37:55.639]  Imagine they had some cult out in the desert in Nevada where there was some crazy dude and you had people convinced to cut arms and legs off or to cut...
[02:37:55.639 --> 02:37:57.040]  Oh, remember Heaven's Gate cult?
[02:37:57.319 --> 02:37:58.840]  They cut their penises off.
[02:37:58.959 --> 02:38:01.719]  It was another Silicon Valley cult.
[02:38:01.860 --> 02:38:04.479]  You look at Silicon Valley, like half of them have cut their penises off.
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:10.479]  You can't get to the spaceship following Hale-Bopp unless you cut your testicles off.
[02:38:11.420 --> 02:38:15.760]  Also, you need to drink a gallon of vodka and take a bunch of painkillers and die.
[02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:19.139]  Make sure you wear your black uniform and white Nike shoes.
[02:38:19.559 --> 02:38:20.940]  Get ready, Scotty.
[02:38:21.159 --> 02:38:22.700]  We're gonna beam you up.
[02:38:24.739 --> 02:38:31.239]  Yeah, if the Hale-Bopp leader was still alive, the Heaven's Gate cult, he'd be probably running Vanderbilt.
[02:38:32.659 --> 02:38:33.479]  In fact, what was his name?
[02:38:33.559 --> 02:38:34.079]  Let's look up his name.
[02:38:34.180 --> 02:38:37.040]  I nominate him posthumously to be the new head of Vanderbilt.
[02:38:37.780 --> 02:38:38.639]  Let's get serious.
[02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:40.299]  I want them all indicted.
[02:38:40.559 --> 02:38:42.200]  It's not enough to pass a law to ban it.
[02:38:42.620 --> 02:38:44.959]  Throw their ass in Supermax prisons.
[02:38:48.500 --> 02:38:53.340]  If somebody grabs your kid off the school bus and cut their penis off, they'd get the death penalty.
[02:38:56.559 --> 02:38:59.139]  Marshall Applewhite, the new head of Stanford.
[02:39:01.899 --> 02:39:03.739]  Look, they went up to the spaceship.
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:06.920]  First you cut your balls off.
[02:39:07.459 --> 02:39:09.379]  Then you kill yourself.
[02:39:09.799 --> 02:39:12.319]  And then you fly up to the spaceship.
[02:39:12.860 --> 02:39:13.780]  Sounds good.
[02:39:14.379 --> 02:39:18.100]  Oh, we're going to cut your genitals off and you're going to be a little girl now.
[02:39:20.180 --> 02:39:22.559]  So let's go to the transgender lawyer.
[02:39:22.739 --> 02:39:24.760]  I forget what this person's name is.
[02:39:25.420 --> 02:39:27.399]  Don't want to misgender her.
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:29.860]  I could be arrested in 10 states.
[02:39:32.439 --> 02:39:35.040]  Oh, Chase Transgeo.
[02:39:35.399 --> 02:39:36.700]  That's not a cult or anything.
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:39.520]  Let's hear from Transgeo.
[02:39:39.659 --> 02:39:40.180]  Here it is.
[02:39:41.450 --> 02:39:45.930]  who's going to argue this high-profile case before the U.S. Supreme Court, Chase Strangio.
[02:39:46.069 --> 02:39:47.149]  Chase, thanks so much for being here.
[02:39:47.229 --> 02:39:47.909]  Really appreciate it.
[02:39:47.989 --> 02:39:59.790]  So the case comes at a time when 26 states have passed laws restricting health care treatments for transgender youth, according to a CNN analysis of data from the nonprofit think tank Movement Advancement Project.
[02:39:59.989 --> 02:40:06.610]  So how do you plan to argue before the U.S. Supreme Court in a case that could have wide-ranging implications beyond the state of Tennessee?
[02:40:07.239 --> 02:40:08.600]  Well, thank you for having me, Jake.
[02:40:08.719 --> 02:40:13.379]  And obviously this is a critical inflection point for transgender people across the country.
[02:40:13.540 --> 02:40:21.659]  We're coming off of an election season where transgender people played an outside role in people's consciousness in terms of the way in which we were situated as a threat to others.
[02:40:21.860 --> 02:40:27.879]  And when we look at the map of states that ban this type of evidence-based health care, we went from zero states that had these bans.
[02:40:27.909 --> 02:40:30.870]  It's being crammed down everyone's throat everywhere.
[02:40:31.090 --> 02:40:35.010]  They're forming secret relationships with your children in public and private schools everywhere.
[02:40:35.209 --> 02:40:39.090]  And literally taking kids in a bunch of states and sterilizing them against parents' will.
[02:40:39.350 --> 02:40:42.309]  I mean, it's a freaking psycho Hellraiser death cult.
[02:40:43.489 --> 02:40:45.030]  And then we got this lady.
[02:40:47.010 --> 02:40:49.290]  Moonlighting is the Groucho Marx lookalike.
[02:40:50.930 --> 02:40:51.850]  Up there.
[02:40:55.350 --> 02:40:56.350]  Playing victim.
[02:40:57.629 --> 02:40:59.809]  We just want access to your children's genitals.
[02:41:01.090 --> 02:41:02.870]  We just want to convince them to cut them off.
[02:41:02.989 --> 02:41:03.690]  That's totally normal.
[02:41:03.950 --> 02:41:04.790]  What's your problem?
[02:41:06.829 --> 02:41:09.270]  Maybe she should learn how to talk like that, like, Hey!
[02:41:11.670 --> 02:41:16.340]  Notice the ACLU Doesn't care about mass censorship and surveillance.
[02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:17.719]  Doesn't care about all the tyranny.
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.139]  Doesn't care about people being debanked for their free speech.
[02:41:20.299 --> 02:41:20.420]  No.
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:27.479]  The ACLU's at Soros took it over is like, we care about taking your kids away and chopping the junk off.
[02:41:27.620 --> 02:41:27.879]  Yeah.
[02:41:28.659 --> 02:41:29.719]  Let's go back to her.
[02:41:30.569 --> 02:41:33.030]  2020 to now more than half the country.
[02:41:33.469 --> 02:41:37.930]  So before the court tomorrow, the question is really a simple one as I see it.
[02:41:38.270 --> 02:41:43.809]  This is a law that bans medical treatment only when it is prescribed inconsistent with an individual's sex.
[02:41:43.989 --> 02:41:53.069]  Our argument is that that treats people differently because of their sex, and therefore the court has to treat it like all other forms of sex discrimination, and that's why it's unconstitutional.
[02:41:53.250 --> 02:42:08.600]  So attorneys representing the state of Tennessee told the U.S. Supreme Court, quote, If the government's theory holds, men who identify as women could claim constitutionally-based access to women's bathrooms, women's locker rooms,
[02:42:08.739 --> 02:42:20.299]  and women's sports, accepting that theory would perversely erode women's rights and jeopardize landmark statutes protecting women's equal access to schools, winners' podiums, and beyond.
[02:42:20.299 --> 02:42:21.659]  What's your response to that?
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:26.100]  Well, I obviously disagree with that premise, that allowing transportation...
[02:42:26.100 --> 02:42:27.040]  Yeah, I mean, hit pause again.
[02:42:28.059 --> 02:42:46.239]  It'd be the equivalent, if somebody served 10 years, say, in the U.S. Army or the Marine Corps or the Navy or the Air Force, and then they want the GI Bill, and then you can't get it because a bunch of people ahead of you who weren't ever in the military,
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:50.360]  don't have discharge papers, identify as veterans.
[02:42:51.590 --> 02:43:00.270]  Or there's a lot of corporate and government grants, which I think are fine, for black folks to go to college and to help them.
[02:43:01.290 --> 02:43:07.209]  A lot of other things happen for everybody like that, so that's good, I think, overall.
[02:43:08.209 --> 02:43:18.469]  Well, then somebody identifies as being black who's not, and they get that money from that scholarship.
[02:43:18.469 --> 02:43:19.350]  That's fraud.
[02:43:20.370 --> 02:43:25.549]  So they're ruining women's sports, ruining everything on purpose to destabilize society.
[02:43:28.010 --> 02:43:29.489]  Chase Stan Gio.
[02:43:29.629 --> 02:43:31.389]  They create these new identities for themselves.
[02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:36.569]  And then they just run around playing victim while they victimize our children.
[02:43:36.809 --> 02:43:37.290]  Let's continue.
[02:43:38.409 --> 02:43:48.489]  Well, I obviously disagree with that premise that allowing transgender women into women's sports or women's bathroom is a threat to women, but it is also not a question before the court in this case.
[02:43:48.610 --> 02:44:03.430]  And in fact, it is a totally independent question about whether a law that bans medical care for transgender adolescents discriminates against people based on sex versus these separate cases that preceded any of these health care bans will continue to be litigated in the courts regardless of the outcome here.
[02:44:14.569 --> 02:44:27.870]  What do you say to physicians who are sensitive and supportive of trans kids, obviously don't want suicidal ideation, etc.?
[02:44:28.129 --> 02:44:31.350]  But wonder if there is enough data as of now.
[02:44:31.370 --> 02:44:32.930]  We already know it wrecks their lives.
[02:44:33.049 --> 02:44:38.850]  We've got to cut this child's penis off, this girl's breast off, her uterus out, or they're going to commit suicide.
[02:44:38.850 --> 02:44:41.049]  Because they commit suicide after they do it.
[02:44:42.090 --> 02:44:43.129]  Especially the women.
[02:44:44.069 --> 02:44:47.510]  They cut off the meat off the forearm, the muscle.
[02:44:47.690 --> 02:44:48.829]  It doesn't have feeling.
[02:44:49.610 --> 02:44:51.750]  And for some reason, it's so hell-raiserous.
[02:44:52.489 --> 02:44:54.049]  I've seen the videos of the surgeries.
[02:44:54.250 --> 02:44:59.770]  Giant, rotting elephant trunks with a piece of PVC tube in it.
[02:45:00.149 --> 02:45:03.290]  And then it almost always rots and falls off very quickly.
[02:45:03.290 --> 02:45:04.530]  And it's like, oh, you're depressed!
[02:45:05.290 --> 02:45:08.549]  We cut your arm off and connected it to you.
[02:45:08.889 --> 02:45:10.489]  And you're a man now!
[02:45:10.629 --> 02:45:11.950]  You got a pee-pee now!
[02:45:13.549 --> 02:45:15.489]  I mean, just the hell of it.
[02:45:15.790 --> 02:45:17.629]  Oh, you committed suicide.
[02:45:17.770 --> 02:45:22.989]  That's because people didn't love your forearm we stitched together and hung off your body.
[02:45:25.430 --> 02:45:27.989]  I mean, what a nightmare.
[02:45:28.750 --> 02:45:31.309]  Imagine 20 years ago telling people this was going to happen.
[02:45:31.489 --> 02:45:32.670]  You'd be like, that's not possible.
[02:45:37.329 --> 02:45:39.489]  I mean, whack jobs.
[02:45:40.889 --> 02:45:41.670]  Let's continue.
[02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:42.270]  Go back to it.
[02:45:43.020 --> 02:45:50.180]  To prove that it is beneficial to allow these sort of treatments before the age of 18. So I would say three things.
[02:45:50.379 --> 02:45:51.920]  And the first is we have...
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:52.860]  Oh, I would say three things.
[02:45:52.979 --> 02:45:53.879]  And we love the children.
[02:45:54.020 --> 02:45:54.860]  We inducted the children.
[02:45:54.959 --> 02:45:55.780]  We brainwashed the children.
[02:45:55.959 --> 02:45:57.280]  It's all about destroying parental rights.
[02:45:57.420 --> 02:45:58.479]  We're in total control of everything.
[02:45:59.239 --> 02:46:00.159]  Sorry, back it up.
[02:46:00.260 --> 02:46:00.479]  Play it.
[02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:03.000]  And so this is not new.
[02:46:03.139 --> 02:46:04.899]  This is not new medication.
[02:46:05.100 --> 02:46:06.500]  And so we have that information.
[02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:09.739]  We have long-term studies that track people for five, six years.
[02:46:09.940 --> 02:46:16.739]  The Supreme Court this week had arguments in an FDA case in which the FDA referred to long-term as being six months of follow-up.
[02:46:16.819 --> 02:46:18.399]  Here we have years of follow-up.
[02:46:18.420 --> 02:46:18.920]  That's enough.
[02:46:19.459 --> 02:46:21.239]  Meanwhile, all the studies are out already shown to you.
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:23.579]  I mean, it's just total evil.
[02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:33.170]  Meanwhile, This system will take your bank account, fire you if you don't take a poison shot.
[02:46:34.670 --> 02:46:36.790]  It's all about taking over people's bodies.
[02:46:38.190 --> 02:46:42.430]  I didn't know this dude did a rap song, former convict.
[02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:42.889]  Wait a minute.
[02:46:43.270 --> 02:46:49.190]  This dude that said ma'am and all that and freaked out on the dude, just said, hey brother, I did a rap song.
[02:46:49.270 --> 02:46:50.229]  Here, let me hear the rap song.
[02:46:50.309 --> 02:46:51.469]  I gotta hear this.
[02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:04.600]  Oh, that's enough.
[02:47:04.860 --> 02:47:06.000]  This has got to be hell.
[02:47:07.260 --> 02:47:07.920]  All right.
[02:47:08.819 --> 02:47:09.760]  I got more.
[02:47:12.020 --> 02:47:14.000]  I told you about Hotez.
[02:47:14.139 --> 02:47:14.860]  I saw the video.
[02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:16.500]  He did a Houston Chronicle interview.
[02:47:17.680 --> 02:47:18.719]  That's even worse.
[02:47:20.829 --> 02:47:22.190]  So I'm going to get to that.
[02:47:22.190 --> 02:47:24.750]  I'm going to get to the GMO news.
[02:47:24.870 --> 02:47:30.969]  I'm going to get to the mayor of New York getting on board with Trump.
[02:47:31.290 --> 02:47:31.889]  Smart move.
[02:47:34.209 --> 02:47:36.690]  And a lot more coming up because he wants a pardon.
[02:47:38.209 --> 02:47:40.750]  Because you know he got indicted because he didn't go along the borders.
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:43.620]  He wasn't enthusiastic enough.
[02:47:44.159 --> 02:47:45.680]  And a few other big stories.
[02:47:46.059 --> 02:47:47.219]  I'm going to have to do this tomorrow.
[02:47:47.559 --> 02:47:48.700]  We've got a whole other hour coming up.
[02:47:48.780 --> 02:47:53.659]  But tomorrow, we're going to do the deep dive on how they are really pulling the rug out from under the economy out of Trump getting in.
[02:47:53.840 --> 02:48:10.340]  So they want to start full war, stage false flags as a coup cover, claiming Trump's Hitler, Do a cyber attack, blaming on Trump supporters, release a new virus, which they're guaranteeing is coming, that's next, put them a cover,
[02:48:10.479 --> 02:48:16.500]  and then probably next as well, what they're literally going to do, and again, pull the rug out from the economy.
[02:48:17.620 --> 02:48:26.940]  That's their plan, make you so poor, you're just so busy trying to get money for energy and food and medicine that you just roll over to them.
[02:48:27.020 --> 02:48:27.620]  That's their plan.
[02:48:28.379 --> 02:48:32.139]  Because they found statistically people that are self-sufficient aren't easy to control.
[02:48:32.860 --> 02:48:34.200]  It's all about power.
[02:48:34.379 --> 02:48:35.200]  It's all about domination.
[02:48:35.219 --> 02:48:36.799]  It's all about overriding your rights.
[02:48:36.959 --> 02:48:40.920]  It's all about enslaving you and packaging it all as new rights.
[02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:43.239]  We have a right to your children.
[02:48:44.020 --> 02:48:50.299]  We have a right to form a relationship with them and convince them that we can cut their body up.
[02:48:51.659 --> 02:48:53.239]  Well, they're not of the age of consent.
[02:48:53.239 --> 02:48:55.260]  That's why they can't have sex.
[02:48:55.579 --> 02:48:56.860]  That's why that's a felony.
[02:49:00.559 --> 02:49:02.559]  That's why they can't join the military.
[02:49:02.559 --> 02:49:04.459]  It's why they can't buy a bottle of Jack Daniels.
[02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:06.639]  It's why they can't buy a pack of Marlboros.
[02:49:08.159 --> 02:49:13.639]  But, oh, you heard what the lady that says she's a dude on CNN was up to.
[02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:19.180]  She's like, well, we've been doing this a while.
[02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:20.620]  Hey, we got a president here.
[02:49:20.739 --> 02:49:23.879]  It's like, hey, Hitler's been invading countries for four or five years.
[02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:24.500]  He's allowed to.
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:27.440]  I mean, hey, we had slavery in America.
[02:49:27.440 --> 02:49:27.959]  It's okay.
[02:49:31.279 --> 02:49:32.299]  Hey, electroshock therapy.
[02:49:32.299 --> 02:49:32.879]  It happened before.
[02:49:32.959 --> 02:49:33.520]  We can do it again.
[02:49:33.700 --> 02:49:34.260]  It's precedent.
[02:49:34.719 --> 02:49:35.659]  Come on!
[02:49:36.540 --> 02:49:37.200]  Come on!
[02:49:37.219 --> 02:49:42.399]  It's just secret government corporate groups coming after your kids to screw them up, put them in a cult, and cut their body parts off.
[02:49:42.459 --> 02:49:44.040]  I mean, God Almighty, big deal.
[02:49:45.239 --> 02:49:46.479]  I mean, be nice to me.
[02:49:46.819 --> 02:49:48.340]  I'm a nice man.
[02:49:48.719 --> 02:49:54.399]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting to stop World War III. We are battling to get Trump into office.
[02:49:54.540 --> 02:49:55.860]  He's only president-elect right now.
[02:49:56.020 --> 02:49:57.739]  We are exposing the globalists.
[02:49:57.819 --> 02:50:00.780]  We are reaching 60, 70, 80 million people a day.
[02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:02.559]  We're back in the Infowar studios.
[02:50:03.360 --> 02:50:05.020]  The purchase was fraudulent.
[02:50:05.159 --> 02:50:07.520]  There's emergency hearings in court coming up next week.
[02:50:07.620 --> 02:50:13.360]  But regardless, I'm gonna stay on air at the Alex Jones Network even if this shuts down.
[02:50:13.540 --> 02:50:18.780]  So when you go to our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, that's not owned by me.
[02:50:19.379 --> 02:50:27.479]  The Onion people and the National Gun Control Crew and the Democrats, even if they succeed, which I don't believe they will, will not get the AlexJonesStore.com.
[02:50:27.479 --> 02:50:30.879]  They will not get the Alex Jones Network because I don't own it.
[02:50:31.100 --> 02:50:39.100]  So when you support our sponsor, the AlexJonesStore.com, with some of the most incredible supplements ever, the superfood, Irish Sea Moss.

[02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:45.020]  Go check it out.
[02:50:45.239 --> 02:50:47.139]  That's their discounted up to $50.
[02:50:47.170 --> 02:50:51.930]  55% when you get three bottles, 50% when you get one bottle, 40% when you get one bottle.
[02:50:52.090 --> 02:50:52.649]  Try it.
[02:50:52.690 --> 02:50:53.309]  You're gonna love it.
[02:50:53.389 --> 02:50:53.829]  I'm on it.
[02:50:53.909 --> 02:50:54.709]  I've lost so much weight.
[02:50:54.969 --> 02:50:55.670]  It's insane.
[02:50:55.790 --> 02:50:56.809]  Get that and other supplements.
[02:50:56.950 --> 02:51:01.469]  And then, there's over 200 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies now there.
[02:51:01.690 --> 02:51:08.000]  These folks that own it bigly were already one of the Top producers of Trump and Patriot gear.
[02:51:08.100 --> 02:51:08.940]  They have the best designs.
[02:51:09.360 --> 02:51:11.079]  All of the new Trump One gear.
[02:51:11.200 --> 02:51:13.559]  There's more than 40 shirts and hoodies and ball caps there.
[02:51:13.940 --> 02:51:15.200]  These designs are incredible.
[02:51:15.379 --> 02:51:21.620]  And now there's all these amazing Alex Jones shirts that are limited edition and will keep me on the air one way or another.
[02:51:21.760 --> 02:51:22.360]  Here they are.
[02:51:22.530 --> 02:51:23.309]  Look at this one.
[02:51:23.469 --> 02:51:27.389]  That famous meme of me coming out of the tunnel with all the Alex Jones clones.
[02:51:27.629 --> 02:51:29.409]  We are all Alex Jones.
[02:51:29.569 --> 02:51:30.569]  You've got to get that.
[02:51:31.209 --> 02:51:32.909]  Gay frogs equals extinction.
[02:51:33.209 --> 02:51:33.850]  Oh my goodness.
[02:51:34.309 --> 02:51:37.469]  What a way to wake folks up about all the poison in the water that's now mainstream news.
[02:51:37.989 --> 02:51:40.850]  1984 is not an instruction manual.
[02:51:41.329 --> 02:51:42.469]  Team Humanity.
[02:51:42.729 --> 02:51:44.149]  Oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[02:51:44.290 --> 02:51:46.489]  Launched that over a year ago with Elon Musk.
[02:51:46.690 --> 02:51:48.430]  And then, Dale Grebel.
[02:51:48.920 --> 02:51:54.059]  Oh, warns you about the government was right the whole time.
[02:51:54.500 --> 02:51:55.379]  Darkest Hour.
[02:51:55.659 --> 02:51:56.819]  Me is Winston Churchill.
[02:51:57.120 --> 02:52:01.899]  And so much more at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:52:01.899 --> 02:52:04.139]  Now, we don't make a ton off the t-shirts.
[02:52:04.680 --> 02:52:09.479]  We don't make a ton off the supplements because there's not a lot of markup in those, but we do sell a lot.
[02:52:09.639 --> 02:52:22.100]  But where we do get major funds is the marked up classic Alex Jones Infowars red on navy blue shirt and a few other fundraiser shirts that aren't 25 or 30 bucks, they're 50, so we get real money in.
[02:52:22.180 --> 02:52:25.840]  Because these t-shirts are high quality, printed right here in Arkansas in the United States.
[02:52:26.450 --> 02:52:29.829]  And so, extra, extra, extra large is like 16, 17 bucks.
[02:52:29.930 --> 02:52:32.250]  A small is like 15. The printing costs money.
[02:52:32.409 --> 02:52:33.670]  The sponsor gets part of the money.
[02:52:33.809 --> 02:52:35.030]  We get part of it to operate.
[02:52:35.670 --> 02:52:38.209]  We're making like six, seven bucks on the average t-shirt, which is great.
[02:52:38.350 --> 02:52:39.190]  And they spread the word.
[02:52:39.309 --> 02:52:39.950]  You meet like-minded people.
[02:52:40.049 --> 02:52:46.350]  But when you get the marked up shirts, only two of them are marked up to 50, we get some real money in to the operation.
[02:52:46.430 --> 02:52:49.610]  So if you really want to support, get the fundraiser shirts.
[02:52:49.989 --> 02:53:00.590]  Also, The posters, limited edition, back-to-back-to-back Trump win, all those are marked up where they cost us six, seven bucks to print them and to put it in the tube.
[02:53:00.750 --> 02:53:03.209]  So we make like 40-something bucks off that.
[02:53:03.329 --> 02:53:13.489]  If you really want to support us and hang it on the wall and know you supported the Second American Revolution right at the critical point, then get some of the limited edition posters as well.
[02:53:13.770 --> 02:53:15.489]  Regardless, you're going to love the supplements.
[02:53:15.690 --> 02:53:16.909]  You're going to want to order again.
[02:53:17.309 --> 02:53:19.370]  We can't stay on air without your support.
[02:53:19.569 --> 02:53:20.809]  I'm suing the deep state.
[02:53:20.950 --> 02:53:21.750]  We're going after them.
[02:53:21.850 --> 02:53:27.870]  We have put all the stuff they did and the bid rigging and everything in these lawsuits and court filings.
[02:53:28.190 --> 02:53:29.350]  We're going to win this thing.
[02:53:29.450 --> 02:53:33.090]  But regardless, we've got to have money to continue to fight them and stay on air.
[02:53:33.229 --> 02:53:42.670]  So go now to thealexjonesstore.com for amazing products and know you stood with fellow Americans at the critical time to save our republic.
[02:53:44.829 --> 02:53:46.670]  TheAlexJonesStore.com Thank you so much for your support.
[02:54:11.840 --> 02:54:15.159]  They called that...
[02:54:16.420 --> 02:54:17.239]  Lobotomy therapy.
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:18.700]  I forget the guy's name.
[02:54:18.780 --> 02:54:20.120]  Guys, pull up the inventor of lobotomies.
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:20.559]  I'm not kidding.
[02:54:20.659 --> 02:54:21.360]  You can't make this up.
[02:54:21.959 --> 02:54:24.340]  Then they come up with electroshock, Walter Friedman.
[02:54:24.559 --> 02:54:34.760]  Then they come up with electroshock therapy, frying your frontal lobe with high-voltage electricity, running a blue arc of electricity through your cerebral cortex.
[02:54:34.979 --> 02:54:39.559]  And now they call gender-affirming care chopping children's genitals off.
[02:54:40.930 --> 02:54:50.809]  Well, Peter Hotez has done a repeat of what Fauci did when Trump first came into power in 2016. He surfaced all over the news.
[02:54:51.290 --> 02:54:58.870]  Big Pharma shill Peter Hotez warns potential pandemics will come crashing down on January 21st on the Trump administration.
[02:55:00.379 --> 02:55:04.879]  Now, he said that on MSNBC. I played the clip earlier, but it's even worse when you read the Houston Chronicle articles.
[02:55:04.879 --> 02:55:05.780]  There's two new ones.
[02:55:06.139 --> 02:55:06.899]  Here's one of them.
[02:55:07.459 --> 02:55:11.479]  Five major disease threats Trump's team must face.
[02:55:11.700 --> 02:55:16.719]  He rattled off like 20 of them, smiling and giggling in the video.
[02:55:16.719 --> 02:55:19.889]  But here he is saying, A... Of the five points.
[02:55:20.290 --> 02:55:21.690]  I'll read it in Fauci's voice.
[02:55:22.250 --> 02:55:32.569]  We've got some big ticket concerns regarding infectious diseases and pandemic threats.
[02:55:33.610 --> 02:55:41.829]  The new administration is not going to have the luxury of time to organize and think about it.
[02:55:42.229 --> 02:55:43.989]  They're going to be...
[02:55:45.819 --> 02:55:49.040]  Confronted with this from the very beginning.
[02:55:49.659 --> 02:55:55.059]  One of the big threats I'm following is H5N1 on avian influenza.
[02:55:55.879 --> 02:55:56.680]  That's how he talks.
[02:55:59.180 --> 02:56:01.180]  I mean, you talk about a supervillain.
[02:56:01.739 --> 02:56:03.219]  He's like the mini-me, though.
[02:56:03.319 --> 02:56:04.280]  He's like the Batman.
[02:56:04.799 --> 02:56:06.940]  The Robin the Batman of supervillains.
[02:56:07.180 --> 02:56:08.319]  Here's an actual photo.
[02:56:08.579 --> 02:56:09.680]  He's now transitioning to a woman.
[02:56:10.059 --> 02:56:12.459]  Here's Peter Hotez helping the children right here.
[02:56:13.900 --> 02:56:15.620]  Let me help you, darling.
[02:56:15.760 --> 02:56:17.420]  Here, let's put your face in the water.
[02:56:17.680 --> 02:56:18.780]  It's a joke, obviously.
[02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:23.719]  If you're a radio listener, it's a graphic of a mother grounding her daughter in the bathtub.
[02:56:24.440 --> 02:56:25.079]  Oh, hi!
[02:56:26.280 --> 02:56:27.979]  I really care about your kids.
[02:56:28.079 --> 02:56:29.120]  Give me access to them.
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:33.780]  I wonder what's on his hard drive.
[02:56:35.180 --> 02:56:38.040]  Do-do [...]-do.
[02:56:43.399 --> 02:56:44.940]  I really want to fight these people.
[02:56:45.079 --> 02:56:46.479]  I really want to stop these people.
[02:56:46.620 --> 02:56:48.360]  I really want to defeat these people.
[02:56:48.559 --> 02:56:51.920]  It's only going to get worse than we've done, and we're starting to really win and turn the tide.
[02:56:53.020 --> 02:56:54.280]  So I'm going to say it again.
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:57:00.579]  I want to thank and salute all of you that share the articles, the videos, the clips, the live feed from Real Alex Jones at Infowars.com.
[02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:08.459]  And I want to implore you to realize you're in a war and to really make it your priority to expose these people.
[02:57:09.190 --> 02:57:11.069]  Because the world's waking up and ready for the truth.
[02:57:11.329 --> 02:57:13.510]  So we're bringing the pain to the new world order.
[02:57:14.030 --> 02:57:17.930]  And get incredible products that will enrich and empower your life.
[02:57:18.090 --> 02:57:19.569]  I won't steer you wrong.
[02:57:19.569 --> 02:57:20.969]  I want to be right.
[02:57:21.190 --> 02:57:22.950]  I want to be tomorrow's news today.
[02:57:23.190 --> 02:57:30.129]  I want you to be blown away by Ultimate CMOS. Which is the superfood at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:57:30.270 --> 02:57:36.250]  I want you to go check out the hundreds of the very best amazing patriot designs to spread the word and meet like-minded people.
[02:57:36.350 --> 02:57:36.969]  It's such an adventure.
[02:57:37.190 --> 02:57:42.809]  I want you to keep us on air against the new world order at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:57:44.170 --> 02:57:58.370]  And I want to thank from the bottom of my guts and my heart and my soul and the center of my mind For you keeping me in this fight, because this is what I do, it's what I'm born to do, and I love it.
[02:57:59.030 --> 02:58:04.930]  And man, I just knew it was the right thing to do, and I predicted we'd start turning the tide.
[02:58:05.329 --> 02:58:06.350]  And it's happening.
[02:58:06.950 --> 02:58:08.549]  I didn't predict it, God told me.
[02:58:09.569 --> 02:58:16.530]  And I'm like, God, you know, you do this thing all the time where you tell me incredible stuff, and am I supposed to tell people this?
[02:58:17.090 --> 02:58:18.090]  God's like, yeah.
[02:58:18.979 --> 02:58:22.659]  So no matter how dumb it sounds when I start telling you to do stuff, do it.
[02:58:22.719 --> 02:58:26.319]  So I'm on election night, two and a half hours before Trump announced the winner.
[02:58:26.600 --> 02:58:31.540]  And I said, Trump will come to the stage at 127 and will announce that he is the winner.
[02:58:31.979 --> 02:58:34.819]  And he came on exactly that and said that.
[02:58:34.940 --> 02:58:37.420]  I was just like, okay, I just told you, I just said this, it just happened.
[02:58:38.260 --> 02:58:43.200]  As my first order of business, I hereby declare, mark the law.
[02:58:43.760 --> 02:58:45.459]  You have to take out their families.
[02:58:45.659 --> 02:58:48.680]  When you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families.
[02:58:49.450 --> 02:58:50.350]  Putin's a killer.
[02:58:50.610 --> 02:58:51.370]  There are a lot of killers.
[02:58:51.590 --> 02:58:52.469]  There are a lot of killers.
[02:58:52.750 --> 02:58:54.030]  Why do you think our country's so innocent?
[02:58:54.170 --> 02:58:55.209]  Death penalty.
[02:58:56.069 --> 02:58:57.209]  Bring it forth.
[02:58:58.049 --> 02:59:00.450]  Killed a good communist to the dead communist!
[02:59:00.649 --> 02:59:04.149]  Donald Trump and the Niger Republicans representing extremism.
[02:59:04.569 --> 02:59:06.270]  Americanism, not globalism.
[02:59:06.389 --> 02:59:08.170]  What threatens the very foundations.
[02:59:08.370 --> 02:59:09.649]  Will be our credo!
[02:59:21.860 --> 02:59:33.299]  Thank you so much.
[02:59:46.090 --> 02:59:52.729]  And like Alex was saying at the beginning of the show, there's so much news in all these stacks that it's hard to know where to begin.
[02:59:53.750 --> 03:00:07.350]  The level of documentation and publication of the deep state and the new world order in terms of what they want to do and what their plan is for humanity is prolific and abundant every single day.
[03:00:07.590 --> 03:00:09.090]  It's overwhelming and alarming.
[03:00:10.790 --> 03:00:12.829]  And I've only been here for about a year and a half.
[03:00:13.090 --> 03:00:15.129]  Alex Jones has been doing this for over 30 years.
[03:00:17.139 --> 03:00:42.360]  And in just the 18 months or so that I've been broadcasting, covering the news and paying close attention, I'm just paying attention ever since 2021, but just the last 18 months, I can understand why it's taxing on the soul to see this level of depravity, this level of content just being purged upon the face of the earth every single day by the most evil people and compromised organizations in the history of compromised organizations.
[03:00:44.850 --> 03:00:49.530]  And there's something I said a couple of weeks ago that is proving to be true.
[03:00:49.690 --> 03:00:51.850]  It wasn't anything super insightful or brilliant by any means.
[03:00:51.930 --> 03:00:57.690]  But I said that when we won this election on the 5th of November, it wasn't the end of a war, but the beginning of a war.
[03:00:57.870 --> 03:01:04.149]  And that things were gonna just get more and more complicated and difficult and combative in the ensuing years.
[03:01:04.190 --> 03:01:07.850]  And we cannot make the mistake that we made in 2016, many of us made.
[03:01:08.340 --> 03:01:15.739]  Of thinking that just because Trump won the election, then we were set, we were good for four years, we didn't have to worry until it was time for another re-election.
[03:01:16.239 --> 03:01:18.879]  Because the big guy's at the top, he's got everything under control.
[03:01:20.680 --> 03:01:33.280]  And as anyone who's been paying attention, as this great audience already knows, our greatest threat now has shifted from the leftists to the rats.
[03:01:34.309 --> 03:01:38.610]  The Republicans against Trump, R-A-T, rats.
[03:01:40.049 --> 03:01:54.350]  Now that we have rendered the leftists, the official explicitly stated, published leftists, now that we have rendered them virtually powerless, they don't have the Senate, they don't have the House, they don't have the White House, they're losing all over the world in droves.
[03:01:54.989 --> 03:02:02.069]  All that's left are those who claim to be Republicans, and maybe the whole rhinos thing is actually a misnomer.
[03:02:03.149 --> 03:02:10.250]  Maybe all of the people that we've been calling Republicans in name only have actually been what Republicans are.
[03:02:10.790 --> 03:02:16.370]  Maybe the Republican Party for the last 20 years has been just neocons and warmongers.
[03:02:16.569 --> 03:02:25.629]  And now with this MAGA movement, we have this populist movement coming in where we're not just shifting the landscape of America in the global political arena.
[03:02:27.030 --> 03:02:29.829]  But we're actually having a renaissance within the party.
[03:02:29.829 --> 03:02:34.110]  So the Republican Party is no longer this neocon, warmongering party.
[03:02:34.309 --> 03:02:36.969]  Now the Republican Party is the MAGA party.
[03:02:36.969 --> 03:02:38.270]  It is the populist party.
[03:02:40.010 --> 03:02:56.590]  And there's this schism, this civil war that's happening right before our eyes within our intelligence community, within our political party, within our movement, where we are seeing the true face in a more blatant and obvious and explicit way than ever of what these neocons are really like.
[03:02:56.670 --> 03:03:01.649]  And I'm talking about you, Adam Kinzinger, and I'm talking about you, Lindsey Graham.
[03:03:03.010 --> 03:03:04.809]  Nobody cares that you're gay, Lindsey.
[03:03:04.969 --> 03:03:06.389]  It just bothers everybody that you hide it.
[03:03:08.360 --> 03:03:11.600]  Coming out and making these very bizarre comments.
[03:03:12.899 --> 03:03:25.659]  Just in, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican in South Carolina, is disturbed by the media stories against Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense, according to CBS. I think some of these articles are very disturbing.
[03:03:25.940 --> 03:03:31.579]  He obviously has a chance to defend himself here, but some of this stuff is going to be difficult.
[03:03:32.079 --> 03:03:32.680]  What?
[03:03:34.549 --> 03:03:36.930]  Is Graham considering voting to reject him?
[03:03:37.090 --> 03:03:42.450]  We see that other so-called rhinos, rats, Republicans against Trump, they come out explicitly, they act like they love Trump.
[03:03:42.510 --> 03:03:43.409]  They love Trump so much.
[03:03:45.569 --> 03:03:49.149]  And then they betray behind the scenes, and then they always vote for more boots on the ground.
[03:03:49.229 --> 03:03:55.629]  They always vote for more money to go to Ukraine to wage wars for no reason so that 500,000 million, a million and a half people can die.
[03:03:55.770 --> 03:03:58.549]  They always vote to support all this stuff, and they always just love it.
[03:04:00.129 --> 03:04:26.860]  I saw a picture of Lindsey Graham sitting with Trump's newly appointed AG on a couch in his office and behind him hanging on the wall, I'm zooming in to try to make sure, behind him hanging on the wall is this giant placard of some legislation and in the middle there's an image of Lindsey Graham shaking George W. Bush's hand and then he's got in the plaque The pen,
[03:04:27.100 --> 03:04:30.979]  presumably, the pen that signed whatever legislation was hanging on the board.
[03:04:31.100 --> 03:04:31.799]  I'm looking it up.
[03:04:32.180 --> 03:04:42.219]  What legislation was it that Lindsey Graham could have authored or sponsored or co-authored or whatever that would have gotten him shaking hands with George Bush and then the pen in the plaque on his office.
[03:04:42.399 --> 03:04:43.139]  And look it up.
[03:04:43.239 --> 03:05:05.239]  It's like the DTA. I can't remember what the acronym stands for, but it's part of the Defense Authorization Act of 2005 or 2006. I'm pulling from memory here, but it was all this stuff that just basically gave the deep state a path for torturing and getting away with it and didn't really regulate the CIA in terms of how it conducted all this Overseas,
[03:05:05.559 --> 03:05:07.959]  basically terrorism, espionage on the American people.
[03:05:08.079 --> 03:05:10.299]  I mean, this guy is the epitome of a deep state hack.
[03:05:10.440 --> 03:05:26.600]  And so on November 5th, we saw the beginning of this war now where we have the Lindsey Graham's coming out and the Adam Kinzinger's coming out and half of the Republican Party, the establishment political class Republican Party like them coming out and just sabotaging every nomination you could possibly imagine,
[03:05:26.739 --> 03:05:28.239]  whether it's Matt Gaetz, whether it's Hegseth.
[03:05:31.020 --> 03:05:45.219]  These are the same people who months ago when Tucker Carlson had some guest whose name escapes me, please forgive me, on his podcast talking about how Churchill wasn't really the hero that we thought he was of World War II, and maybe Churchill was responsible in some sophisticated ways.
[03:05:45.879 --> 03:05:49.100]  This analysis was fairly sophisticated and nuanced.
[03:05:49.440 --> 03:05:53.579]  Maybe Churchill was responsible for some unnecessary escalations.
[03:05:53.719 --> 03:05:56.799]  I don't know if it's true or not, but it was a fairly sophisticated argument.
[03:05:57.620 --> 03:06:02.620]  Some unnecessary escalations in World War II. And everybody came out saying, oh, he's a Hitler lover.
[03:06:02.780 --> 03:06:03.680]  He's anti-Semitic.
[03:06:03.760 --> 03:06:04.540]  Churchill was a hero.
[03:06:04.659 --> 03:06:05.459]  Churchill was a hero.
[03:06:06.159 --> 03:06:06.899]  All these people.
[03:06:06.959 --> 03:06:07.799]  And maybe Churchill was.
[03:06:07.920 --> 03:06:08.299]  I don't know.
[03:06:08.399 --> 03:06:08.860]  I like him.
[03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:10.459]  I thought he was charming in the movies.
[03:06:10.500 --> 03:06:14.780]  I like his top hat and his cigar and the fact that he had a drink.
[03:06:14.780 --> 03:06:16.059]  And you could hardly understand what he was saying.
[03:06:16.059 --> 03:06:19.459]  Not because he was drinking too much, but because his accent was so heavy.
[03:06:19.520 --> 03:06:20.520]  And his speech was amazing.
[03:06:20.920 --> 03:06:21.899]  To find him on the beaches.
[03:06:23.819 --> 03:06:39.899]  But the same people who come out and celebrate Churchill as some sort of saint of Western culture are coming out now and saying that, oh, this Hegseth thing is gonna be super difficult because there are rumors from anonymous sources at Fox News that maybe he had a bit too much to drink.
[03:06:41.149 --> 03:06:41.870]  Are you kidding me?
[03:06:42.030 --> 03:06:44.270]  You're going to celebrate Churchill and then bash Hegseth?
[03:06:44.450 --> 03:06:50.629]  I thought Churchill was one of the best leaders in a wartime world of all time, according to all the neocons, according to everybody.
[03:06:50.930 --> 03:06:53.549]  But then, oh, Hegseth, that's questionable because maybe he drinks too much.
[03:06:55.309 --> 03:06:56.969]  Which, first of all, we don't even know if it's true.
[03:06:57.110 --> 03:07:01.149]  I mean, it was just made up, published, based on anonymous sources.
[03:07:01.350 --> 03:07:02.850]  Could potentially not be true at all.
[03:07:02.950 --> 03:07:04.829]  But then even if it is true, it's like, whatever.
[03:07:06.399 --> 03:07:08.379]  We're good to go.
[03:07:27.569 --> 03:07:32.889]  A critical mass such that we all feel it every single day in all of our lives in almost everything that we do.
[03:07:32.969 --> 03:07:37.309]  Whether it's to go fill up a tank of gas or whether it's to go to the grocery store and try to make ends meet.
[03:07:38.190 --> 03:07:44.190]  Whether you're getting calls from debt collectors or whether you're part of the 21% increase year over year in bankruptcies.
[03:07:45.010 --> 03:07:48.590]  We're feeling all of this because of the corruption of this political class which taxes us.
[03:07:48.889 --> 03:07:53.510]  And then because our taxes are not enough, Prince Money which weakens our buying power.
[03:07:53.629 --> 03:07:54.290]  It's another tax.
[03:07:54.430 --> 03:07:55.409]  It's a ghost tax.
[03:07:56.780 --> 03:08:13.420]  So that they can fund unnecessary war after unnecessary war to prop up the system which just allows them to skim from the top which now has also resulted in them skimming from the bottom to the point where there is just nothing but pain and suffering and concern and worry among all people.
[03:08:15.409 --> 03:08:19.569]  Such financial strife and difficulty that divorces are rampant if marriage even occurs at all.
[03:08:19.629 --> 03:08:27.690]  The family is torn apart, and everybody in this country is forced to outsource the raising of their children from the ages of 4 to 20 to the state?
[03:08:28.329 --> 03:08:33.370]  And these public school systems, which secretly advocate for the transition of our children?
[03:08:33.510 --> 03:08:34.329]  I mean, come on.
[03:08:34.649 --> 03:08:37.549]  And I don't want to beat a dead horse talking about tranny this, tranny that.
[03:08:37.930 --> 03:08:39.370]  They want to chop off your kids' dicks.
[03:08:39.409 --> 03:08:40.670]  They want to chop off your kids' breasts.
[03:08:41.229 --> 03:08:42.170]  You guys know.
[03:08:42.170 --> 03:08:42.870]  You get it.
[03:08:44.049 --> 03:08:50.750]  But the fact that Americans have been brought to a place economically where they have basically no other choice in mass.
[03:08:51.329 --> 03:08:52.870]  Some of us are fortunate that we do.
[03:08:53.090 --> 03:09:02.530]  But to send their kids to these institutions, which the likes of Kamala Harris will arrest you if your child does not show up to their mandatory probation.
[03:09:02.750 --> 03:09:04.889]  I mean, I remember being in high school in a public school.
[03:09:05.350 --> 03:09:14.559]  I was fortunate enough to go to a fairly normal school in a small town that hadn't been Contaminated with this philosophy.
[03:09:15.920 --> 03:09:17.780]  But I remember being disgusted.
[03:09:17.840 --> 03:09:23.399]  I was reading Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman and Wealth of Nations when I was in high school because I was just that kid.
[03:09:23.879 --> 03:09:40.969]  I remember being frustrated at lunch, seeing the other kids The 200 kids sitting around the lunch tables, laughing, flirting, having a good time, eating the rectangle pizza with the diet ranch dressing that Michelle Obama mandated,
[03:09:41.129 --> 03:09:45.190]  drinking their diet Dr. Pepper that Michelle Obama mandated during the Let's Move campaign.
[03:09:45.329 --> 03:09:53.350]  And I'm thinking to myself, how are you having fun and laughing and enjoying yourself in this place when you are not legally allowed to leave?
[03:09:55.889 --> 03:09:59.729]  I mean, the amount of psychological manipulation that must have taken place.
[03:09:59.729 --> 03:10:03.270]  And I was treated like the weird one for being unhappy there.
[03:10:03.729 --> 03:10:06.090]  What do you mean I legally have to be here for eight hours a day?
[03:10:06.149 --> 03:10:11.530]  I got a letter from the state of Illinois when I was in high school that said, if I missed one more day of high school, I couldn't legally graduate.
[03:10:11.690 --> 03:10:15.989]  So the last three months of high school, my senior year, my attendance was like a Boy Scout.
[03:10:16.549 --> 03:10:17.670]  I was there every day.
[03:10:21.489 --> 03:10:24.149]  But this level of manipulation...
[03:10:26.789 --> 03:10:33.729]  And gaslighting by even our own party is absolutely disgusting to me.
[03:10:33.809 --> 03:10:35.110]  I mean, let's just show you a couple of clips.
[03:10:35.489 --> 03:10:37.250]  Let's show clip D as in dog.
[03:10:37.729 --> 03:10:40.729]  This is from The View that they're unhappy that they lost.
[03:10:40.870 --> 03:10:41.870]  D as in dog, play it.
[03:10:42.930 --> 03:10:44.329]  You know what's in the air, Whoopi?
[03:10:44.909 --> 03:10:45.350]  Trumpism.
[03:10:45.649 --> 03:10:46.809]  We lost the election.
[03:10:47.010 --> 03:10:47.389]  Wait a minute.
[03:10:47.530 --> 03:10:48.889]  We lost the election.
[03:10:49.209 --> 03:10:49.909]  We're miserable.
[03:10:50.329 --> 03:10:51.889]  Half of this country is miserable.
[03:10:52.110 --> 03:10:53.569]  And let's just tell the truth.
[03:10:53.670 --> 03:10:55.190]  We hate that he won.
[03:10:55.430 --> 03:10:56.049]  We hate it.
[03:10:58.909 --> 03:11:01.829]  And everybody's up tight and crazy right now.
[03:11:05.569 --> 03:11:07.829]  They're clapping like seals at SeaWorld.
[03:11:09.629 --> 03:11:14.770]  Because Joy Behar is coming out and saying, we're so unhappy that we lost, stating the abundantly obvious.
[03:11:14.909 --> 03:11:21.149]  Meanwhile, we have left us like AOC, Eclipsee, streaming for no goddamn reason whatsoever.
[03:11:21.489 --> 03:11:22.290]  Look, she even admits it.
[03:11:22.389 --> 03:11:23.149]  I don't even know why I'm streaming.
[03:11:23.250 --> 03:11:24.190]  I'm just streaming because I love attention.
[03:11:24.370 --> 03:11:24.510]  Watch.
[03:11:27.049 --> 03:11:27.770]  Hey, everyone.
[03:11:29.600 --> 03:11:30.639]  I'm just popping on.
[03:11:32.440 --> 03:11:33.459]  Just popping on?
[03:11:34.260 --> 03:11:39.620]  To be honest, I'm not even sure why I'm popping on right now.
[03:11:39.760 --> 03:11:40.200]  Hey, everybody.
[03:11:42.180 --> 03:11:43.100]  Hey, everyone.
[03:11:43.260 --> 03:11:45.959]  Thanks for joining.
[03:11:46.399 --> 03:11:47.360]  I mean...
[03:11:47.360 --> 03:11:52.180]  Hey, everyone.
[03:11:52.819 --> 03:11:53.639]  Just popping on.
[03:11:55.659 --> 03:11:56.059]  What?
[03:11:56.600 --> 03:11:58.200]  These are the people that we're electing.
[03:11:58.319 --> 03:11:59.799]  These are the people that we're celebrating.
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:04.059]  Millions upon millions upon millions upon millions of dollars to Ukraine.
[03:12:04.139 --> 03:12:05.700]  And I know Ukraine is an old story.
[03:12:05.840 --> 03:12:06.180]  I know.
[03:12:06.520 --> 03:12:11.180]  After a war has gone on for three years, it's almost like nobody should even talk about it because we know.
[03:12:11.319 --> 03:12:14.840]  After a war has gone on in the Middle East for 20 years, why are we even talking about it?
[03:12:14.899 --> 03:12:19.159]  After the Patriot Act has been enacted for 15 or 20 years, why should we even talk about it?
[03:12:19.659 --> 03:12:31.299]  After Julian Assange has been in prison for years and years, after Edward Snowden has been forced to flee his own country for years and years, it's hardly even a story even anymore, despite the fact that it's still happening to him every day.
[03:12:33.739 --> 03:12:41.139]  But this Ukraine thing where they're coming out with a, what was it, blinking this week another $750 million to Ukraine for God knows what reason?
[03:12:43.159 --> 03:12:45.700]  Just throwing cash into the bonfire.
[03:12:47.089 --> 03:12:50.850]  Just evaporating after it's skimmed and stolen by these warmongers.
[03:12:51.069 --> 03:12:55.809]  And then we claim that everything we do is for the good of democracy.
[03:12:56.190 --> 03:12:58.909]  Everything we do is for our own national security interests.
[03:12:59.270 --> 03:13:03.110]  All of this aid is totally necessary because we care about humanity so much.
[03:13:03.190 --> 03:13:04.569]  We know the government doesn't have a conscience.
[03:13:04.729 --> 03:13:05.969]  No government has a conscience.
[03:13:06.149 --> 03:13:13.950]  It either has rules that it has to follow or it has no rules and does the most evil thing possibly imaginable.
[03:13:14.190 --> 03:13:16.290]  Genocides, wars, holocausts, things of that nature.
[03:13:18.030 --> 03:13:22.370]  It's a consciousness, a government.
[03:13:23.629 --> 03:13:26.290]  And you either regulate it or you don't.
[03:13:27.870 --> 03:13:37.750]  But the reason we do these wars is because we make so much money destroying nations and peoples, and we make so much money, again, building them back up on the other end.
[03:13:37.909 --> 03:13:43.829]  This is clip number F. Mike Benz, no aid in USAID on Joe Rogan.
[03:13:43.889 --> 03:13:45.090]  Watch this, brilliant analysis.
[03:13:45.469 --> 03:13:48.530]  State Department, USAID, and the National Endowment for Democracy.
[03:13:52.300 --> 03:13:53.840]  It's sort of a switch player.
[03:13:54.100 --> 03:13:56.399]  There's no aid in USAID, by the way.
[03:13:56.860 --> 03:14:01.120]  Your brain is being tricked when you see the phrase USAID. It's not an aid organization.
[03:14:01.420 --> 03:14:05.520]  The aid in USAID stands for US Agency for International Development.
[03:14:05.979 --> 03:14:14.170]  It is developing Internationally, around the world, all of the institutions that the State Department needs to use.
[03:14:14.690 --> 03:14:24.110]  So, when they are capacity-building activist groups in a foreign country, that's because the State Department wants those activists there.
[03:14:24.670 --> 03:14:44.899]  Now, USAID, for the first time in its history, it was created in the early 1960s by JFK, 1961. It was created because you had all of this Intelligence, statecraft, and military support and logistical aid that was tripping over itself,
[03:14:44.899 --> 03:14:45.520]  basically.
[03:14:45.719 --> 03:14:50.579]  The military would be running aid to certain groups in the region.
[03:14:50.600 --> 03:14:53.659]  The State Department would be running aid to certain groups in the region.
[03:14:53.840 --> 03:14:54.979]  The Intelligence Committee would...
[03:14:55.440 --> 03:15:00.799]  And there was no sort of central coordinator of those capacity building operations.
[03:15:01.379 --> 03:15:03.379]  USAID, by the way, is a $50 billion budget.
[03:15:03.700 --> 03:15:06.319]  The entirety of the intelligence community is only $72 billion.
[03:15:06.540 --> 03:15:10.319]  So it is more than the CIA and more than the State Department.
[03:15:10.639 --> 03:15:10.840]  Wow.
[03:15:11.500 --> 03:15:17.639]  And USAID is effectively a switch player to assist the Pentagon with...
[03:15:28.649 --> 03:15:31.110]  Hey, we've been talking about it for decades.
[03:15:31.110 --> 03:15:34.309]  It's called the military-industrial complex, which...
[03:15:34.860 --> 03:15:37.059]  Wasn't even good enough for the deep state.
[03:15:37.200 --> 03:15:46.420]  They had to expand it beyond military operations into the political industrial complex where it has contaminated and infected basically every department of government.
[03:15:46.780 --> 03:15:55.340]  And when those departments are fully saturated with this diabolical philosophy and economic scheme, they just make more departments and expand the government.
[03:15:55.540 --> 03:16:02.379]  Did you know that over 95% of new jobs in California last year were government jobs?
[03:16:04.129 --> 03:16:08.090]  That's why they want to expand the government because it's expanding the Ponzi scheme.
[03:16:08.290 --> 03:16:26.870]  And instead of talking about that, instead of talking about the fact that USAID, USAID, has a $50 billion budget, everyone's talking about how cute little mousy Adam Kinzinger is when he comes on The View, clip number N, just bashing Trump for no reason other than he's a giant pussy,
[03:16:26.870 --> 03:16:27.309]  I guess?
[03:16:27.389 --> 03:16:27.809]  Let's watch.
[03:16:29.379 --> 03:16:33.020]  So Trump recently announced his plans to appoint Magdalena...
[03:16:33.020 --> 03:16:35.719]  Meanwhile, he's the smallest person at the table, the only one with a set of balls.
[03:16:35.840 --> 03:16:45.079]  ...and you have been trolling cash on social media calling him, and I want to quote this, crazy eyes and a, quote, straight-up psycho.
[03:16:45.340 --> 03:16:46.840]  So it's safe to say you're not a fan.
[03:16:46.899 --> 03:16:47.700]  Not a big fan, nope.
[03:16:47.899 --> 03:16:49.100]  And why is that?
[03:16:49.200 --> 03:16:55.819]  So look, this is a guy, so he actually started out as a staffer for Devin Nunez on the intel committee.
[03:16:56.100 --> 03:16:57.120]  Oh, the cow guy.
[03:16:57.180 --> 03:16:58.299]  Yeah, the cow guy.
[03:16:59.159 --> 03:17:06.620]  David Nunez was normal until he wasn't, until all of a sudden he got in Donald Trump's kind of circle and Kash Patel went basically crazy with this.
[03:17:06.700 --> 03:17:16.479]  So he put out an enemies list, a so-called enemies list of members of the deep state, which again is part of that darkness, that division, that thing that's trying to turn us against each other.
[03:17:16.639 --> 03:17:21.180]  And he actually in a recent interview said on day one he's going to close down the FBI building.
[03:17:21.239 --> 03:17:22.079]  Of course he won't.
[03:17:22.260 --> 03:17:25.379]  But day one, he's going to close it down and make it a monument to the deep state.
[03:17:25.680 --> 03:17:30.620]  When you politicize the position of FBI director, that is really dangerous in this country.
[03:17:30.659 --> 03:17:35.760]  And to know what Donald Trump's intention is, all you have to do is listen to what he's accusing his opponents of.
[03:17:35.920 --> 03:17:40.180]  If he accuses his opponents of politicizing justice, he fully intends to do that.
[03:17:40.219 --> 03:17:42.239]  And you can see this is one of those picks, unfortunately.
[03:17:42.620 --> 03:17:43.500]  He's going to attack the press, too, as well.
[03:17:44.079 --> 03:17:50.020]  He's going to attack the press, too, as well, says the program that had issued, like, four legal notices because they're always wrong.
[03:17:51.239 --> 03:17:58.020]  I feel bad, like I won't troll somebody that's innocent, but somebody that goes out and trolls people, I think they- You feel you have a role to play.
[03:17:58.139 --> 03:18:00.379]  Yeah, a little bit, because you call out the hypocrisy.
[03:18:00.500 --> 03:18:00.920]  That's what I see.
[03:18:00.979 --> 03:18:04.840]  So like, again, Kash Patel putting out his enemies list, right?
[03:18:05.200 --> 03:18:18.139]  Well, that's important to point out that- Says the guy who supported funding of Ukraine and the CIA, which put me, Alex Jones, half the staff here at Infowars among 200 other people.
[03:18:18.829 --> 03:18:21.389]  On an enemies list for Ukraine.
[03:18:21.590 --> 03:18:31.510]  So his government wants to put me and others on an enemies list for another country paid for by my tax dollars for the CIA. And then he's mad at Kash Patel for coming out with an enemies list.
[03:18:32.610 --> 03:18:34.670]  Maybe he's just mad because he's on it.
[03:18:34.989 --> 03:18:39.889]  Maybe he's just mad because he knows that he's the real enemy of America and he doesn't want to be on any lists.
[03:18:40.450 --> 03:18:43.450]  This is the guy that puts us literally on lists.
[03:18:44.129 --> 03:18:52.190]  When you have the Tulsi Gabbards and others that are on terrorist watch lists at the airport, they have to go through special screening when they get on a plane for no reason whatsoever.
[03:18:52.989 --> 03:18:57.530]  This guy has the audacity to say that he doesn't think it's good that Kash Patel put people on lists.
[03:18:58.770 --> 03:19:05.129]  And frankly, putting people on lists is one of the requirements to be the director of the FBI, isn't it?
[03:19:05.610 --> 03:19:09.110]  Doesn't the FBI have a famous list called America's Most Wanted?
[03:19:09.469 --> 03:19:11.870]  Maybe making lists is actually part of the job.
[03:19:12.090 --> 03:19:13.709]  Maybe there should be people on lists.
[03:19:14.069 --> 03:19:17.110]  Maybe it's just been the wrong people on the list the whole time.
[03:19:17.250 --> 03:19:18.549]  And that's why we need to catch Mattel.
[03:19:18.610 --> 03:19:21.629]  And you're going to see his crazy eyes because the photographer took too long to take his picture.
[03:19:21.850 --> 03:19:23.750]  So his eyes are up because he's trying not to blink.
[03:19:24.649 --> 03:19:25.090]  Please.
[03:19:25.770 --> 03:19:26.209]  Please.
[03:19:27.290 --> 03:19:28.209]  Adam Kinninger.
[03:19:30.350 --> 03:19:34.229]  Here's psycho-feminists saying that Trump wants to put people on a firing squad.
[03:19:34.389 --> 03:19:36.090]  This is clip M. Watch this.
[03:19:36.770 --> 03:19:37.809]  NBC News said it.
[03:19:37.870 --> 03:19:44.770]  Honestly, what the other side has been saying for years, what you guys ran on for president, was multiple lies.
[03:19:44.870 --> 03:19:46.909]  I mean, if Eric Holder said it right, I think.
[03:19:47.030 --> 03:19:49.350]  He said if Hunter's name was Joe Smith- She's gonna cite Eric Holder.
[03:19:51.399 --> 03:19:55.260]  Fast and furious, disproportionately auditing conservatives.
[03:19:56.379 --> 03:20:00.159]  But wasn't to Scott's point, I mean, wasn't it a lie?
[03:20:00.319 --> 03:20:04.399]  I mean, you can defend it, but wasn't it a lie that he was not gonna pardon?
[03:20:04.559 --> 03:20:06.819]  No, I believe the circumstances have changed.
[03:20:07.079 --> 03:20:19.120]  I think that we now have a president coming into office who's talking about firing squads, who's talking about running people around the country and making sure that everyone who's his enemy is going to be punished.
[03:20:19.500 --> 03:20:23.159]  And Hunter Biden lied about his drug use on a government forum when he was buying a gun.
[03:20:23.219 --> 03:20:26.079]  And he failed to file and pay taxes when he was a drug addict.
[03:20:26.299 --> 03:20:28.200]  He paid back those taxes with interest.
[03:20:28.639 --> 03:20:33.260]  Donald Trump himself was invited for 17 counts of criminal tax fraud, more than Hunter.
[03:20:33.399 --> 03:20:35.540]  And he's going to be- She's been given a list by a producer.
[03:20:36.670 --> 03:20:39.270]  Because she has an objective given to her by someone else.
[03:20:39.750 --> 03:20:42.409]  And they have to read from lists because they have no thoughts of their own.
[03:20:42.709 --> 03:20:44.510]  I came in here with one list.
[03:20:45.290 --> 03:20:47.770]  A list of clips that I thought might be interesting.
[03:20:49.209 --> 03:20:53.370]  Because I can talk about this stuff because I have my own ideas, my own thoughts, my own philosophy.
[03:20:53.510 --> 03:20:54.270]  Sometimes it's flawed.
[03:20:54.409 --> 03:20:55.270]  Sometimes I make mistakes.
[03:20:55.450 --> 03:20:56.110]  Sometimes it's wrong.
[03:20:56.149 --> 03:20:56.770]  I'm not perfect.
[03:20:57.090 --> 03:20:59.309]  But I'm not reading someone else's thoughts.
[03:20:59.530 --> 03:21:01.250]  I'm not reading someone else's propaganda.
[03:21:02.569 --> 03:21:13.530]  These networks that read into teleprompters are dying because they read lying trash in a tacky and sophisticated way, and nobody's buying it anymore.
[03:21:13.909 --> 03:21:19.969]  And frankly, the whole firing squad's claim about Trump is a lie, and it's one of those lies about Trump I wish was true sometimes.
[03:21:21.000 --> 03:21:25.319]  Maybe it is time for firing squads, politically, spiritually, emotionally, culturally.
[03:21:25.579 --> 03:21:26.540]  Folks, more on the other side.
[03:21:26.639 --> 03:21:27.000]  Stay with us.
[03:21:27.500 --> 03:21:32.479]  I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's gonna save this country and nothing's gonna stop it.
[03:21:33.540 --> 03:21:37.040]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[03:21:37.239 --> 03:21:39.840]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[03:21:39.940 --> 03:21:40.739]  I'm still not in shape.
[03:21:41.600 --> 03:21:43.040]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[03:21:43.180 --> 03:21:44.120]  Don't tell me eating right.
[03:21:44.180 --> 03:21:45.000]  I'm not gonna buy that shit.
[03:21:45.720 --> 03:21:48.479]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[03:21:50.659 --> 03:21:53.180]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[03:21:53.459 --> 03:21:59.280]  I did it all from the alexjonesstore.com with Ultimate Seamoss, the ultimate seafood.
[03:21:59.500 --> 03:22:00.219]  That's why, right here.
[03:22:00.979 --> 03:22:06.059]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[03:22:06.200 --> 03:22:07.860]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[03:22:08.200 --> 03:22:09.799]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[03:22:12.549 --> 03:22:16.469]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss.
[03:22:16.590 --> 03:22:19.770]  And I am doing a plug here, because, you know, we could be shut down next Tuesday.
[03:22:20.370 --> 03:22:23.229]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court.
[03:22:23.409 --> 03:22:26.590]  But we'll continue on in the air one way or another, working with great folks.
[03:22:27.209 --> 03:22:28.690]  Give me good from before they said no.
[03:22:28.909 --> 03:22:31.350]  Our word is, this is a Chinese bioweapon.
[03:22:32.450 --> 03:22:33.750]  Exactly what you just said.
[03:22:34.409 --> 03:22:42.530]  In fact, before, you told me that separately from my sources inside the Central Intelligence Agency saying the same thing.
[03:22:42.670 --> 03:22:55.030]  It's now being confirmed that this coronavirus was being weaponized and studied in labs in the United States, Canada, Europe, China, you name it, and that the CHICOMs got caught stealing it out of labs.
[03:22:55.469 --> 03:23:09.629]  And so the big takeaway is Why are all these labs around the world weaponizing viruses, quote, to study them or, oh, in case it ever mutates, they've got the weaponized virus and they can make a vaccine out of it.
[03:23:10.610 --> 03:23:17.690]  Because the cover for bioweapons production is research into countering bioweapons.
[03:23:17.809 --> 03:23:27.370]  And that's how Russia, China, the United States, the UK, that's how all these nuclear powers and biological weapon powers have gotten around it is research.
[03:23:29.079 --> 03:23:29.979]  Defense research.
[03:23:30.180 --> 03:23:31.639]  It's not defense research.
[03:23:32.000 --> 03:23:33.200]  And it's madness.
[03:23:33.959 --> 03:23:40.239]  And of course, now it's coming out that most experts believe it's a engineered bioweapon.
[03:23:40.379 --> 03:23:42.200]  And that's in the medical reports.
[03:23:42.440 --> 03:23:48.600]  You know, the last four releases of SARS that killed a lot of people were out of Chinese labs.
[03:23:48.899 --> 03:23:53.239]  New research cashed out the coronavirus started in Wuhan food market.
[03:23:53.360 --> 03:23:53.899]  Of course it did.
[03:23:53.899 --> 03:23:56.780]  It started in a bioweapons lab.
[03:23:57.649 --> 03:24:06.750]  An interim report released by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions concluded that COVID was, quote, more than likely the result of a research accident in Wuhan.
[03:24:07.090 --> 03:24:08.850]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser.
[03:24:09.010 --> 03:24:15.290]  We have 25 minutes left of this broadcast before the great Owen Schroer takes over with The War Room from 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:24:15.430 --> 03:24:15.670]  Central.
[03:24:15.670 --> 03:24:20.709]  I am broadcasting from the front lines of the information war in Austin, Texas.
[03:24:21.329 --> 03:24:28.829]  Surrounded by the enemy on all sides, fighting back against lies, deceit, and censorship is an honor and a pleasure to be with you.
[03:24:29.309 --> 03:24:30.350]  I want to show you this clip.
[03:24:30.450 --> 03:24:31.750]  This is Tucker Carlson in Moscow.
[03:24:31.750 --> 03:24:32.409]  He's back.
[03:24:32.549 --> 03:24:34.350]  This is clip number A as an apple.
[03:24:34.870 --> 03:24:43.030]  This clip of Tucker just proves that he's a hero and shows the world a little bit of what true journalism is.
[03:24:43.170 --> 03:24:51.920]  Remember, he wanted to interview Zelensky, as I understand it, but the CIA... Told Zelensky that was not a good idea.
[03:24:52.280 --> 03:25:00.680]  So, Zelensky followed the orders of his higher-ups and operated like the satellite that he is for our own deep state interests.
[03:25:01.059 --> 03:25:03.700]  Let's watch clip number A and unpack it.
[03:25:04.170 --> 03:25:19.610]  In the weeks since we left Russia, Moscow, where we are now, in February, after interviewing Vladimir Putin, we've watched from the United States as the Biden administration has driven the US ever closer to a nuclear conflict with Russia, the country that possesses the world's largest nuclear arsenal.
[03:25:20.469 --> 03:25:27.430]  It has accelerated ever since, and it's reached its apogee so far in the weeks after Trump's election.
[03:25:27.590 --> 03:25:28.629]  He's now the president-elect.
[03:25:28.909 --> 03:25:37.809]  In that time, just a few weeks ago, the Biden administration, American military personnel, launched missiles into mainland Russia and killed at least a dozen Russian soldiers.
[03:25:38.270 --> 03:25:46.889]  So we are, unbeknownst to most Americans, in a hot war with Russia, an undeclared war, a war you did not vote for and that most Americans don't want, but it is ongoing.
[03:25:47.569 --> 03:25:57.149]  And because of that war, because of the fact that the US military is killing Russians in Russia right now, we are closer to nuclear war than at any time in history.
[03:25:57.389 --> 03:26:00.030]  Far closer than we were during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[03:26:00.270 --> 03:26:03.610]  That would mean the elimination of Russia, the United States, and most of the rest of the world.
[03:26:04.379 --> 03:26:11.819]  We felt there must be someone behind the scenes in Washington working to make sure that this conflict doesn't become a nuclear holocaust.
[03:26:12.020 --> 03:26:14.360]  But we found out that no, in fact, there is nobody.
[03:26:14.979 --> 03:26:20.559]  Tony Blinken, the current Secretary of State, cut off all contact between the U.S. and Russian governments.
[03:26:20.739 --> 03:26:21.739]  There is no backchannel.
[03:26:21.840 --> 03:26:22.899]  There is no conversation.
[03:26:23.040 --> 03:26:24.600]  There hasn't been for more than two years.
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:25.739]  That's shocking.
[03:26:26.399 --> 03:26:32.520]  Meanwhile, most Americans have no access to any perspective other than that granted to them by NBC News and the New York Times.
[03:26:32.639 --> 03:26:34.239]  They don't know how close we are.
[03:26:34.319 --> 03:26:35.360]  They don't know the Russian perspective.
[03:26:36.659 --> 03:26:41.600]  We've been trying for over a year to get that perspective out to American news consumers.
[03:26:41.739 --> 03:26:45.799]  We've also tried for over a year to get an interview with Zelensky, the president of Ukraine.
[03:26:46.040 --> 03:26:48.059]  We've attacked that from a bunch of different angles.
[03:26:48.280 --> 03:26:51.139]  He's spoken to a lot of different people around him, had dinner with them.
[03:26:51.239 --> 03:26:55.700]  We've been in talks continuously, and those efforts have been thwarted by the U.S. government.
[03:26:55.899 --> 03:27:02.540]  The American embassy in Kiev, which our tax dollars pay for, told the Zelensky government, no, you may not do the interview.
[03:27:02.950 --> 03:27:05.350]  You can talk to CNN. You can't talk to us.
[03:27:05.450 --> 03:27:06.770]  So we've been unable to speak to him.
[03:27:06.950 --> 03:27:15.309]  So we came back to Moscow yesterday to interview the foreign minister of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, the longest serving foreign minister in the world.
[03:27:15.309 --> 03:27:18.309]  He's been a part of this government for 25 years.
[03:27:18.450 --> 03:27:23.270]  He's been in the diplomatic corps for over 40. And ask him, where exactly are we?
[03:27:23.389 --> 03:27:29.629]  Are we headed toward An unprecedented conflict between Russia and the United States.
[03:27:30.030 --> 03:27:35.590]  Is there any way to peel Russia back from the East, from the sphere of China, back into the West?
[03:27:35.870 --> 03:27:37.250]  Is that alliance permanent?
[03:27:37.590 --> 03:27:48.110]  And does the election of Donald Trump mean an end to this war, which is reshaping the world, the US economy, the global economy, and risking the life of every person on this planet?
[03:27:48.129 --> 03:27:48.969]  Is that possible?
[03:27:49.329 --> 03:27:50.809]  We just walked out of that interview.
[03:27:50.950 --> 03:27:51.969]  It's absolutely fascinating.
[03:27:52.270 --> 03:27:53.670]  It's coming very soon.
[03:27:53.750 --> 03:27:54.389]  We hope you'll watch.
[03:27:56.549 --> 03:27:57.889]  Well, well, well.
[03:27:59.129 --> 03:28:09.129]  U.S. intelligence would not allow Zelensky to speak to Tucker Carlson, but was happy to allow Zelensky to speak to CNN. What does that tell you about who's compromised?
[03:28:09.770 --> 03:28:11.069]  Which networks are compromised?
[03:28:11.409 --> 03:28:13.110]  Which individuals are compromised?
[03:28:14.190 --> 03:28:18.870]  And like I said before, I'll say it again, I know you're tired of hearing about Ukraine.
[03:28:19.090 --> 03:28:21.370]  I know you're tired of hearing about Taiwan.
[03:28:21.670 --> 03:28:26.790]  I know you're tired about hearing About Israel.
[03:28:28.829 --> 03:28:30.149]  And I'm tired of it.
[03:28:30.850 --> 03:28:31.950]  Sick and tired of it.
[03:28:32.649 --> 03:28:36.809]  And it's not about any one people or any one nation.
[03:28:37.750 --> 03:28:47.049]  It's the fact that we have a deep state apparatus, an entire political class, both covert and overt, that is hell bent on globalism.
[03:28:48.210 --> 03:29:00.049]  Global interdependence, the new world order, was supposed to be a bastion of freedom and peace and prosperity for all of mankind, where we were not a world of nations, but one nation world.
[03:29:01.620 --> 03:29:15.020]  Where we weren't a world of different races and cultures, but we were a world of one species, and finally we were going to come together as one people on one planet, and it would be the end of all conflict, and we were going to globalize the economy.
[03:29:15.020 --> 03:29:29.069]  We were going to ensure that enemies, whether they're communists or fascists, Or dictators or warlords, we're all going to be neutralized by this economic interdependence, by this fiat currency which relied on the Federal Reserve.
[03:29:29.649 --> 03:29:32.030]  By war after war after war.
[03:29:33.530 --> 03:29:39.149]  Where we would be so interdependent that China would collapse if it wasn't for us spending money importing all of their goods.
[03:29:39.370 --> 03:29:44.229]  And the United States would collapse if it weren't for China because we couldn't afford to manufacture our own goods.
[03:29:45.090 --> 03:29:50.780]  Because of organized labor and other laws and regulations that make it Not competitive to do anything here.
[03:29:51.059 --> 03:29:53.860]  That was supposed to lead to peace.
[03:29:54.360 --> 03:30:02.620]  This interdependence was going to create a perpetual, recursive, permanent, cyclical stalemate.
[03:30:03.440 --> 03:30:05.780]  Where it was just constantly going to be a draw.
[03:30:06.920 --> 03:30:08.020]  Cross the board.
[03:30:09.079 --> 03:30:10.700]  And instead, what have we seen?
[03:30:10.799 --> 03:30:15.659]  But conflict after conflict after conflict and war after war after war after war after war.
[03:30:17.329 --> 03:30:21.629]  Because of this new world order, this Federal Reserve fractional banking system.
[03:30:21.829 --> 03:30:28.270]  I mean, look at all the trash that happened in 1913. Just look at the major events of 1913. What organizations sprung up?
[03:30:28.569 --> 03:30:29.569]  What banks were created?
[03:30:29.909 --> 03:30:42.389]  And then suddenly within four years, we're in World War I. When World War I ends, and suddenly within 20 years, less than 20 years, we're in World War II. And then World War II ends, and then suddenly within 20 years, we're off the gold standard, and we're in Vietnam.
[03:30:43.290 --> 03:30:44.030]  And we're in Iraq.
[03:30:44.190 --> 03:30:45.190]  And we're in Afghanistan.
[03:30:45.549 --> 03:30:46.090]  And we're in Ukraine.
[03:30:46.270 --> 03:30:47.290]  And now we're fighting in Israel.
[03:30:47.370 --> 03:30:48.350]  And now we're fighting for Taiwan.
[03:30:48.649 --> 03:30:51.129]  And now there's major conflicts in the Pacific.
[03:30:52.129 --> 03:30:56.489]  And we're all concerned about what China can do with balloons and ships.
[03:30:56.549 --> 03:30:58.770]  And their shipbuilding capacity is so much greater than ours.
[03:30:58.870 --> 03:30:59.950]  And we're totally compromised.
[03:31:00.129 --> 03:31:06.969]  And now we're doing everything that we can to subvert China's expansion and trade in the entire hemisphere because of...
[03:31:09.159 --> 03:31:25.780]  There are new trade routes that we've gotten so entwined with the Ukraines and the Israels and others that in order to protect our own interests, we have to go to war and just cause the death of hundreds of thousands of innocent people,
[03:31:25.959 --> 03:31:29.719]  women and children alike, especially women and children, given that they're the most vulnerable, the first to go.
[03:31:31.739 --> 03:31:33.200]  While they call us Nazis.
[03:31:35.569 --> 03:31:45.049]  Well, they call us fascists because we tell them to stop war and stop perpetuating an economy built on a monetary system that is fundamentally a lie.
[03:31:46.149 --> 03:31:51.129]  I don't want to bore you with economic theory or gripes about foreign interests and corruption.
[03:31:51.309 --> 03:31:54.549]  The fact of the matter is, every people is equally corrupt.
[03:31:55.129 --> 03:31:59.090]  There is no one group or one people more corrupt than any other.
[03:31:59.270 --> 03:32:03.989]  We are all equally capable of evil, and the United States is just as corrupt and evil as Russia.
[03:32:04.739 --> 03:32:06.180]  Just as corrupt and evil as Israel.
[03:32:06.319 --> 03:32:07.579]  Just as corrupt and evil as Taiwan.
[03:32:07.799 --> 03:32:10.139]  I know you don't hear a lot of griping about Taiwan and poor little island.
[03:32:10.559 --> 03:32:16.639]  I'm telling you folks, the people at the top of Taiwan are just as capable and willing to conduct evil as any of these other superpowers.
[03:32:20.299 --> 03:32:22.059]  I don't want to beat a dead horse here.
[03:32:23.799 --> 03:32:29.399]  But this is fundamentally the philosophical and logical flaw of globalism.
[03:32:29.879 --> 03:32:40.600]  It was claimed, it was thought that globalism would lead to a stalemate and peace and economic interdependence that would cease all wars and conflict and that we would be able to go on and produce in harmony.
[03:32:40.739 --> 03:32:42.959]  But the fact of the matter is, it's done exactly the opposite.
[03:32:43.459 --> 03:32:46.899]  It has expanded waste and inflation and poverty.
[03:32:48.459 --> 03:32:51.780]  And regardless of whether you believe in climate change or not, it certainly hasn't been good for the environment.
[03:32:55.639 --> 03:33:18.579]  So we have to come out in the name of nationalism, in the name of populism, in the name of national sovereignty, and we have to acknowledge the conflict, the cognitive dissonance that is our government advocating for the national sovereignty of every nation in the world except our own.
[03:33:19.110 --> 03:33:24.170]  Oh, Ukraine's borders are so important, but 20 million people can storm across the border in the United States.
[03:33:24.329 --> 03:33:32.209]  Oh, Israel's sovereignty is so important, but it doesn't matter how many people are murdered or raped by illegal migrants in the United States of America.
[03:33:32.610 --> 03:33:39.049]  Oh, Taiwan should be independent from China, but it doesn't matter how dependent the United States is for pharmaceutical drugs on China.
[03:33:39.229 --> 03:33:41.709]  It doesn't matter that China has to send, gets to send...
[03:33:42.840 --> 03:33:46.520]  Enough fentanyl into the United States every year to amount to the death of 100,000 people.
[03:33:46.639 --> 03:33:51.200]  What is it like the number one cause of death for people under the age of 40 is overdose in this country?
[03:33:51.299 --> 03:33:51.879]  Thanks, China.
[03:33:53.340 --> 03:33:55.920]  We care so much about Taiwan's independence from China.
[03:33:55.920 --> 03:34:00.579]  We become so dependent on China that we're basically addicted to them to the point where we're overdosing on them.
[03:34:00.700 --> 03:34:02.420]  We're literally overdosing on China.
[03:34:04.319 --> 03:34:08.520]  Let's run clip number L, as in loser.
[03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:16.209]  This is Mike Benz, breaking down how every aspect of Ukraine really boils down to our own deep state apparatus.
[03:34:16.430 --> 03:34:16.670]  Let's watch.
[03:34:16.950 --> 03:34:23.629]  Look at something called the Red Lines Memo, which is, I think I have it near the top of my exit counter.
[03:34:23.770 --> 03:34:25.489]  You can look for just the phrase, Red Lines Memo.
[03:34:25.590 --> 03:34:41.090]  And you will see, Zelensky's first month in office, he was given a threat letter, effectively by the U.S. State Department, where they had something like 70 U.S.-funded NGOs who wrote a letter to Zelensky And telling him,
[03:34:41.250 --> 03:34:49.450]  ordering him not to cross the below-listed red lines or else there will be political instability in your country.
[03:34:49.590 --> 03:34:56.129]  Now, political instability in the country caused by the U.S. State Department is the reason Zelensky ultimately became president.
[03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:58.750]  The 2014 coup in Ukraine was...
[03:34:59.379 --> 03:35:09.520]  U.S. and U.K. orchestrated political instability to have a January 6th-style mob destabilize the government and literally run it out of the country.
[03:35:09.979 --> 03:35:14.799]  And they gave him red lines on every single aspect of what he could do as president.
[03:35:15.340 --> 03:35:16.620]  Security red lines.
[03:35:17.670 --> 03:35:20.409]  Cultural red lines, energy policy red lines.
[03:35:20.409 --> 03:35:22.229]  What were these red lines, cultural red lines?
[03:35:22.229 --> 03:35:31.450]  So, for example, that he could not allow the use of Russian language to be aired on any of the major Ukrainian media channels.
[03:35:32.049 --> 03:36:00.030]  This was part of a drive by the US State Department in tandem with the censorship work that started at that same time in order to prevent the sort of affinity, The sort of Russian affinity network that happens because of Russian propaganda spreading from Russian language news sources and to try to pry the country off of the Russian ethnic faction and have essentially the Ukrainian dialect.
[03:36:00.370 --> 03:36:01.690]  This is in response for what happened in Crimea?
[03:36:02.069 --> 03:36:02.670]  Yes, yes.
[03:36:02.829 --> 03:36:07.690]  And Crimea and the Donbass, the whole eastern side breakaway.
[03:36:07.829 --> 03:36:20.079]  But this is effectively the long arm of Of Langley, the long arm of the State Department and CIA, telling Ukrainians what kind of language they can use in their own country.
[03:36:20.399 --> 03:36:32.159]  Ukraine was effectively forced to transfer over its education ministry to an EU commissioning body so that Russian-adjacent mythologies couldn't be taught in the country.
[03:36:32.620 --> 03:36:43.239]  They were told what industries they needed to privatize and to block any attempt to maintain sovereign control of those energy assets.
[03:36:43.379 --> 03:36:56.000]  This is ultimately what gave rise to the Burisma scandal, by the way, and the Hunter Biden State Department affairs that ran through all of that, which is a whole other fascinating topic, I should add.
[03:36:56.520 --> 03:36:57.819]  I'd love to get back to that.
[03:36:58.719 --> 03:37:00.860]  But this is...
[03:37:03.409 --> 03:37:20.489]  Every aspect of Ukrainian society, effectively top-down controlled by democratic institutions, funded by the U.S. government, when it's stock standard that the only reason we do that, you know, he who pays the piper calls the tune.
[03:37:21.540 --> 03:37:28.479]  They're being funded to exert this soft power issue, this soft power force on the Ukrainian government.
[03:37:28.600 --> 03:37:40.639]  And Zelensky knows that force because the only reason he occupies the power that he does is because that force ushered him in through the sequence of events from Yatsenyuk in 2014 up to him.
[03:37:40.979 --> 03:37:47.350]  And so the issue is, Those are the institutions.
[03:37:47.610 --> 03:38:02.770]  By the way, that whole thing was run through something called the Ukraine Crisis Media Center, which is effectively a suite of media institutions in the area that are CIA conduits, like the Kiev Independent, which is funded by the National Endowment for Democracy.
[03:38:06.619 --> 03:38:10.700]  Most pernicious forces in the entirety of the censorship industry.
[03:38:11.479 --> 03:38:16.239]  And, you know, you were talking with Marc Andreessen about NGOs and their role in internet censorship.
[03:38:16.739 --> 03:38:19.719]  And, you know, he was, I think, fleshing out sort of the concept of the government.
[03:38:19.719 --> 03:38:24.840]  An absolutely brilliant breakdown of what's going on in that episode with Mike Bounds on Joe Rogan's podcast.
[03:38:25.059 --> 03:38:28.379]  Folks, I mean, what else am I supposed to tell you?
[03:38:28.459 --> 03:38:30.559]  What else can we do?
[03:38:30.559 --> 03:38:31.600]  Please tell me.
[03:38:32.959 --> 03:38:35.180]  What else can we do?
[03:38:36.770 --> 03:38:49.270]  To stop this seemingly insurmountable foe from coming in like a tsunami and just wiping out everything that civilization has produced.
[03:38:50.870 --> 03:39:04.350]  I mean, this deep state foe almost successfully established a unilateral monopoly over information in the world.
[03:39:06.739 --> 03:39:34.479]  Until Elon Musk bought Twitter and turned it into X. They almost established a universal, unilateral monopoly over political power in the world until Donald Trump came out of left field and catalyzed a populist movement and won a third term.
[03:39:37.030 --> 03:39:56.790]  And I don't know about you, but to me it is shocking and alarming and dangerous that we as human beings on the planet Earth have to rely on rogue billionaires having a conscience and coming out and doing something about it in the 11th hour.
[03:40:00.049 --> 03:40:02.129]  People talk trash about Trump.
[03:40:02.309 --> 03:40:05.549]  They talk trash about Elon Musk all day long.
[03:40:06.540 --> 03:40:07.899]  Say what you will about Elon Musk.
[03:40:08.059 --> 03:40:15.459]  Maybe you're worried about Neuralink and the technology potentially leading to mass surveillance and control of the human psyche.
[03:40:15.600 --> 03:40:21.639]  Maybe you're worried about artificial intelligence taking over and replacing humans and then betraying them.
[03:40:23.219 --> 03:40:25.819]  Maybe you're concerned that Elon Musk has had his hand in that technology.
[03:40:28.920 --> 03:40:40.540]  Say what you will about Donald Trump, and maybe he's egotistical, maybe he's bombastic, maybe he repeatedly surrounds himself with bad people like Sebastian Gorka, who just talk about war and relief factor over and over again.
[03:40:42.959 --> 03:40:47.219]  And sabotage the interests of populism in America.
[03:40:49.120 --> 03:40:59.200]  But these two people over the course of the last four years have basically made it so that the death and subjugation of all of humanity is not guaranteed any longer.
[03:40:59.319 --> 03:41:00.120]  It is no longer guaranteed.
[03:41:00.260 --> 03:41:12.760]  I mean, if they would have lost, if Elon Musk would not have taken over Twitter, if Trump would not have won this election, which may not have been possible if Musk hadn't bought Twitter and turned it into X. Then our demise would have been virtually guaranteed.
[03:41:12.760 --> 03:41:21.860]  There would have actually been, at some point in the next 50 years, had these two failed in their mission over the course of the last three, been civil war in this country.
[03:41:22.020 --> 03:41:25.379]  Violent, bloody, real, hot civil war.
[03:41:26.239 --> 03:41:31.040]  Starvation, supply chain disruption, no relief for natural disasters.
[03:41:31.299 --> 03:41:34.440]  I mean, pathetic Sodom and Gomorrah level destruction.
[03:41:34.639 --> 03:41:35.040]  I mean, just...
[03:41:36.600 --> 03:41:55.920]  Fire and brimstone and injustice and pain and suffering and hell on earth and inferno on the planet, probably World War III. And now we have not guaranteed ourselves victory, but we have purchased ourselves with these two a shot at saving humanity from global Satanism.
[03:41:59.440 --> 03:42:04.579]  And I'm not using the term Satanism in some hyperbolic colloquial sense.
[03:42:05.680 --> 03:42:10.719]  Where you think of a pentagram and candles and people casting spells and selling their soul for riches and fame.
[03:42:11.379 --> 03:42:22.059]  I'm talking about Satanism in the true sense of the term, which is all that, which is an adversary to the will of God, to the design of God, to the plan of God.
[03:42:22.139 --> 03:42:31.520]  And God established himself first in the Bible as a creator, a creator of the earth, a creator of humanity, a creator of all that we know and want and love.
[03:42:32.120 --> 03:42:33.059]  All that is good.
[03:42:34.489 --> 03:42:39.450]  And so anything that is counter the interests of creation is by definition satanic.
[03:42:39.809 --> 03:42:54.200]  And these globalists in their anti-human philosophy, in narcissistic, egotistical, God-making hubris, Are the epitome of satanic whether they even know it or not.
[03:42:54.520 --> 03:42:57.559]  I doubt if you asked Klaus Schwab whether he was a satanist.
[03:42:57.719 --> 03:42:59.760]  He would honestly tell you that's ridiculous.
[03:42:59.760 --> 03:43:00.440]  I am not.
[03:43:00.540 --> 03:43:01.239]  He would mean it.
[03:43:01.319 --> 03:43:02.260]  He would think that he wasn't.
[03:43:02.479 --> 03:43:05.200]  But his philosophy says otherwise because it's entirely anti-human.
[03:43:07.139 --> 03:43:13.260]  Klaus Schwab, George Soros, Nancy Pelosi, Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton.
[03:43:13.620 --> 03:43:16.079]  These people, whether they know it or not, they probably don't.
[03:43:16.159 --> 03:43:18.299]  That's what's so deceptive about satanism.
[03:43:19.639 --> 03:43:22.200]  Are acting in the interests of Satanism.
[03:43:22.379 --> 03:43:23.360]  They are Satanists.
[03:43:23.479 --> 03:43:24.180]  They say they're humanists.
[03:43:24.319 --> 03:43:24.559]  No, they're not.
[03:43:24.680 --> 03:43:25.079]  They're Satanists.
[03:43:25.180 --> 03:43:25.819]  They say they're globalists.
[03:43:25.899 --> 03:43:28.159]  That's true, but it's also Satanism.
[03:43:29.620 --> 03:43:42.459]  And we have arrived at this place as human beings where we have to rely on people like Alex Jones and Elon Musk and Donald Trump and maybe two dozen others.
[03:43:44.120 --> 03:43:50.620]  If I sat down, I could make a list if I really thought about it to save people All 7 billion of us?
[03:43:51.620 --> 03:43:54.319]  From total subjugation and demise?
[03:43:55.819 --> 03:44:03.639]  And all of the people that would be on that list, Alex Jones, Trump, Musk, and others, are all under relentless attack from within and without.
[03:44:07.639 --> 03:44:28.590]  Constant attempts to compromise their establishments, whether it's Infowars itself, whether it's any of Musk's companies, SpaceX, Tesla, X, Whether it's Trump within his administration, within his businesses, constantly under attack with lawfare and assassination attempts and violence and the imprisonment of their various supporters.
[03:44:30.270 --> 03:44:32.790]  Not just nationally, but abroad as well.
[03:44:37.129 --> 03:44:44.450]  And so I'm just racking my brain here trying to figure out what we can do to stop this seemingly insurmountable foe.
[03:44:45.469 --> 03:44:49.229]  The foe that is evil itself at the highest and lowest levels.
[03:44:49.469 --> 03:44:53.790]  And the only thing I can think of is sitting in this chair and doing everything I can to keep Alex Jones on air.
[03:44:56.209 --> 03:44:58.309]  And I know what it's like to feel powerless.
[03:44:58.489 --> 03:45:06.370]  I felt that way in 2021 when I started my podcast, when I realized after they called January 6th an insurrection, that my vote was not good enough.
[03:45:06.370 --> 03:45:12.409]  I also wanted a voice and I worked like hell for years to get to a point where I could broadcast and support truth and free speech.
[03:45:16.370 --> 03:45:18.409]  Now I'm presenting you with the same opportunity.
[03:45:19.469 --> 03:45:33.690]  If you are not satisfied with your vote, if your vote is not enough and you realize that in order to defeat evil worldwide, you need more than just a vote, you need a voice, then the best thing that you can do is go to thealexjonesstore.com.

[03:46:43.770 --> 03:46:44.889]  What an amazing aircraft.
[03:46:45.110 --> 03:46:46.549]  Chris, I gotta say, man, we love you.
[03:46:46.610 --> 03:46:47.350]  Thanks for the support.
[03:46:48.079 --> 03:46:48.879]  I love you, Alex.
[03:46:49.059 --> 03:46:51.159]  I love Bigley, Nate, Colin.
[03:46:51.399 --> 03:46:51.780]  Thanks, Chris.
[03:46:51.860 --> 03:46:56.979]  This is one of the pinnacles in my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there, just being in this studio.
[03:46:56.979 --> 03:46:58.180]  I never imagined I'd be here.
[03:46:58.200 --> 03:46:59.120]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[03:46:59.180 --> 03:46:59.819]  You're the reason we're here.
[03:47:00.059 --> 03:47:02.360]  It's so cool how cool the listeners are.
[03:47:02.420 --> 03:47:02.840]  It is.
[03:47:03.200 --> 03:47:03.319]  Yes.
[03:47:03.520 --> 03:47:04.020]  Oh, thank you.
[03:47:04.260 --> 03:47:05.340]  The listeners are amazing.
[03:47:05.579 --> 03:47:11.319]  Like, everyone that goes to the Alex Jones store, obviously you're in it to win this truck, but this experience of coming on the show, how is this, Chris?
[03:47:11.479 --> 03:47:15.180]  I mean, is this not, this is like a, it's a dream, I would feel like, for the winner, right?
[03:47:15.360 --> 03:47:27.899]  Fortunately, I slept pretty good last night, but it's been very stressful because he said, Colin said, you're going on the show, and I was like, I'm a little camera shy, but here I am, and I've done well, Lord Vader.
[03:47:28.920 --> 03:47:31.280]  I said, I'll do whatever I need to do to help Alex and Bigley.
[03:47:31.479 --> 03:47:33.100]  Well, I'm glad I got to meet you.
[03:47:33.180 --> 03:47:34.959]  We're going to eat some barbecue from Terry Blacks here in a minute.
[03:47:35.280 --> 03:47:36.680]  Am I starting to mouthwater when you said that?
[03:47:36.739 --> 03:47:37.299]  No, I'm starving.
[03:47:37.399 --> 03:47:41.399]  Now, real quick, this is all done by a computer, by a professional company.
[03:47:41.639 --> 03:47:42.760]  I was talking to you guys before.
[03:47:43.319 --> 03:47:44.639]  Sometimes it's in the middle of it.
[03:47:44.700 --> 03:47:45.500]  Sometimes it's at the end.
[03:47:45.559 --> 03:47:46.479]  Sometimes it's at the start.
[03:47:47.260 --> 03:47:49.700]  Have you seen where somebody who entered on the first day won?
[03:47:50.010 --> 03:47:55.670]  You know, honestly, we've done probably 30 of these giveaways and have never seen someone win on the very first day.
