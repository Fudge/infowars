[00:00:01.118 --> 00:00:06.901]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:12.564]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:18.947 --> 00:00:25.751]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Thursday, August 8th, 2024, and we've got one element transmission lined up for you.
[00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:34.266]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:34.286 --> 00:00:38.489]  164 days to the inauguration.
[00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.491]  That's the real number.
[00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:43.313]  Not the 89 or the 88 to the election.
[00:00:55.944 --> 00:01:00.285]  The deep state is making their move and they're openly saying they will not let Trump back into office.
[00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:06.667]  They already tried to kill him.
[00:01:06.747 --> 00:01:17.669]  Tommy Robinson gives us a major update on the incredible police state unfolding in the UK and the framing of himself, Andrew Tate and others for calling for violence, which they never did.
[00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.150]  Laura Logan in studio.
[00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.611]  She's in there hosting the war room right now for Steve Bannon, who's in prison.
[00:01:26.323 --> 00:01:30.125]  Drew Hernandez and so much more today.
[00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:31.826]  All right.
[00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:36.008]  Tim Walz is done.
[00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:39.710]  He'll never get away with this.
[00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:54.518]  They are now uncovering news article interviews and multiple TV interviews and speeches he gave where he claimed, in the technical nomenclature he used, that he is a combat veteran.
[00:01:55.523 --> 00:02:00.445]  But instead he betrayed those under his command and did just a terrible thing.
[00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:10.408]  Veterans understand all the complexities of this and that's why they're so outraged because he stole valor in a very technical, specific way.
[00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:17.630]  Tim Walz's stolen valor fiasco is quickly becoming a disqualifying spectacle.
[00:02:19.332 --> 00:02:25.475]  The National Guard, people that worked with him and the other officers have been putting out letters exposing him.
[00:02:26.775 --> 00:02:30.417]  Report Tim Walz falsely claimed he was a veteran of Afghanistan.
[00:02:31.797 --> 00:02:33.598]  Veterans will not be fooled by Tim Walz.
[00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:35.559]  This is huge.
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.202]  And as the former governor of Minnesota said, he is Bernie Sanders in hunting gear.
[00:02:41.262 --> 00:02:41.982]  Don't be fooled.
[00:02:45.584 --> 00:02:46.424]  That's all coming up.
[00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:49.851]  With the video clips that will sink his ass.
[00:02:51.832 --> 00:02:52.412]  Next segment.
[00:02:53.752 --> 00:02:59.953]  Biden went on national TV yesterday and said there will not be a peaceful transference of power if Trump wins.
[00:03:02.254 --> 00:03:03.774]  You think, well, that's just his fried brain.
[00:03:04.454 --> 00:03:06.655]  Well, yeah, because he's saying the secret part out loud.
[00:03:07.015 --> 00:03:13.616]  But that's what Raskin and Pelosi and all the other operatives are saying openly.
[00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:16.580]  And that tells you where they're coming from.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.341]  That is huge.
[00:03:18.642 --> 00:03:24.606]  Then, we've analyzed how Harris is finally getting some pretty big crowds.
[00:03:24.626 --> 00:03:28.049]  10,000-20,000 people in Atlanta, Dearborn, Michigan, places like that.
[00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.350]  Atlanta, Georgia, Dearborn, Michigan.
[00:03:30.231 --> 00:03:30.991]  We have it right here.
[00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:37.917]  They're telling people that there's going to be some big music stars there, and they'll announce one or two big ones, but say that there'll be a surprise one.
[00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:44.182]  Then they have their surrogates, kind of a Democrat version of Cube, and oh, the word is it's Taylor Swift.
[00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:46.340]  And we've caught them doing that.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.541]  And notice she just cancelled her tour.
[00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:58.867]  Now the new, blue QAnon, blue-anon thing is, Taylor Swift will be her new running mate when Walls drops out.
[00:03:58.907 --> 00:04:01.248]  I mean, this is a train wreck.
[00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.229]  Or as they say, a Chinese fire drill.
[00:04:06.331 --> 00:04:06.551]  So,
[00:04:09.244 --> 00:04:09.944]  That's where we are.
[00:04:09.984 --> 00:04:11.325]  It's not attacking Chinese.
[00:04:11.345 --> 00:04:12.345]  That's where the term comes from.
[00:04:12.405 --> 00:04:12.946]  It's from China.
[00:04:12.966 --> 00:04:17.648]  Because just like our fire drills where we had fire departments, everybody would just grab buckets of water and go throw it on there.
[00:04:17.668 --> 00:04:18.588]  Everybody's running every direction.
[00:04:19.429 --> 00:04:20.509]  Like chickens with their heads cut off.
[00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:24.171]  And that's what's going on with the Democrats right now.
[00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:29.273]  And it is going to be crazy with this convention coming up here very soon.
[00:04:29.353 --> 00:04:31.054]  So we're going to be looking at all of that.
[00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:32.835]  And the bait and switches.
[00:04:34.755 --> 00:04:36.636]  And the Democrat attempts to steal elections.
[00:04:37.197 --> 00:04:37.737]  Governor Glenn,
[00:04:40.131 --> 00:04:48.097]  Duncan puts Virginia into play, announces sweeping election security measures to protect legal voters.
[00:04:48.157 --> 00:04:51.179]  Every legal vote deserves to be counted without being watered down by illegal votes.
[00:04:52.233 --> 00:04:57.256]  So that whole leftist brainwashing tactic that, oh, there's no illegals voting when they openly are, is backfiring.
[00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:59.116]  Other states are going to be cracking down.
[00:04:59.897 --> 00:05:04.259]  And so it may cut back a lot of the margin of fraud and get Trump in there, baby.
[00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:07.120]  So this is just incredible time to be alive.
[00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:09.902]  You can cut the suspense with a knife.
[00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:10.542]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:11.223 --> 00:05:13.784]  We are living in such an incredibly historic time.
[00:05:16.371 --> 00:05:17.391]  It is Thursday, August 8, 2024.
[00:05:17.691 --> 00:05:19.472]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:20.012 --> 00:05:21.893]  Laura Logan coming up in studio.
[00:05:23.273 --> 00:05:29.495]  Tommy Robinson with major update on the incredible police state behavior in the UK that's a model for the rest of the world.
[00:05:30.475 --> 00:05:32.236]  And so much more today.
[00:05:34.797 --> 00:05:42.439]  Biden has come out and repeated what Raskin and others are saying, that there will not be a peaceful transference of power if Trump is reelected.
[00:05:43.831 --> 00:05:46.452]  They're going to have civil unrest, civil war conditions.
[00:05:47.132 --> 00:05:49.973]  I played that clip of Raskin the last three days over and over again.
[00:05:50.453 --> 00:05:52.573]  Biden goes on national TV, says the same thing yesterday.
[00:05:53.594 --> 00:05:56.535]  Does that get your attention yet, folks, of what we're facing?
[00:05:59.195 --> 00:06:06.878]  We've then got all the dirty tricks Kamala Harris is pulling to get big crowds out for her finally by claiming there's going to be these big music acts there.
[00:06:07.638 --> 00:06:09.758]  And then as soon as the music act's done, everybody leaves.
[00:06:10.298 --> 00:06:10.859]  Totally pathetic.
[00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:11.759]  We've got all the evidence of that.
[00:06:13.596 --> 00:06:16.377]  Walls is done in any real universe.
[00:06:18.098 --> 00:06:21.900]  He's been caught in total stolen valor, claiming he was a combat veteran of Afghanistan.
[00:06:24.761 --> 00:06:25.762]  Absolutely insane.
[00:06:26.942 --> 00:06:30.204]  We've got all of that coming up, and so much more.
[00:06:30.844 --> 00:06:37.307]  We have Walls, this is an Infowars.com article with a video, flees from reporters who confront him over stolen valor allegations.
[00:06:37.947 --> 00:06:39.148]  Nobody's gonna put up with this.
[00:06:40.592 --> 00:06:46.655]  And we've got clip after clip, and they're bad on C-SPAN and giving speeches where he claims he's a combat veteran.
[00:06:47.916 --> 00:06:52.178]  Because on top of that, he resigned his commission when they went to war.
[00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:55.960]  Which is the ultimate cowardly act.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.921]  It's one thing if you're enlisted, people look down on it.
[00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:00.902]  There's one thing if you're draft dodged, people look down on it.
[00:07:00.943 --> 00:07:09.327]  But if you are an officer for 20 years, and finally get called up to run artillery in Afghanistan,
[00:07:10.598 --> 00:07:14.280]  And you cut and run, that right there is a total disqualifier.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.201]  You want that guy as the Vice President?
[00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:20.003]  Or you want Trump who gets shot and pops right back up and says, fight, fight, fight?
[00:07:21.244 --> 00:07:23.425]  I mean, these two clowns are incredible.
[00:07:25.806 --> 00:07:30.409]  And another video is resurfaced of two veterans confront wall staff over false allegations of service claim.
[00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:35.892]  Told them Stolen Valor Act violations could lead to jail time.
[00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:42.213]  So this is all just pouring out right now.
[00:07:44.094 --> 00:07:58.103]  So we're going to show the clip we showed yesterday of him giving a speech lying about a combat veteran, the new video that just came out last night of him on C-SPAN saying it, and then him being confronted years ago over it, and then confronted again today.
[00:07:59.084 --> 00:08:00.044]  I mean, I smell blood.
[00:08:01.004 --> 00:08:05.326]  Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of pedo scum.
[00:08:06.087 --> 00:08:10.409]  Be he live or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to make my bread.
[00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:15.492]  I smell victory.
[00:08:16.713 --> 00:08:18.654]  I smell defeat of our enemies.
[00:08:23.256 --> 00:08:25.978]  But that only makes them more dangerous now they're so cornered.
[00:08:26.598 --> 00:08:29.820]  But I do see victory in most paths forward.
[00:08:30.859 --> 00:08:34.122]  Some will be very costly, some not costly at all.
[00:08:34.142 --> 00:08:38.305]  I don't really see any path to victory for our enemies long term.
[00:08:39.045 --> 00:08:39.906]  We have turned the tide.
[00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:48.192]  That means there's some utopia we're offering, and you know, a free lunch and all that crap, but humanity's really tough to kill.
[00:08:50.054 --> 00:09:00.542]  And yeah, we've been drunk on entertainment and the easy life for a long time, myself included, but there's nothing like tyranny getting up in your grill to get you to get your head screwed on straight.
[00:09:02.415 --> 00:09:06.018]  And now it's time to screw that sucker on straight like a laser beam.
[00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:08.680]  But let's begin with this.
[00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:26.575]  If Joe Biden with his fried brain said this, and he was the only one saying it, and it wasn't mud of the CIA, and Pelosi of Congress, and Raskin of Congress, and just hundreds of these clips, professors, movies, TV shows, fiction, non-fiction, civil war.
[00:09:27.556 --> 00:09:29.378]  If he just said this alone,
[00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.851]  I'd be like, ah, he has his right brain.
[00:09:32.511 --> 00:09:32.811]  It's not.
[00:09:34.552 --> 00:09:36.613]  He gets in these meetings and he's getting senile.
[00:09:36.673 --> 00:09:40.734]  He can't keep what the real plan is versus the fake plan he puts out to the public.
[00:09:41.855 --> 00:09:45.857]  So they ask the question, so will there be a peaceful transfer of power?
[00:09:46.417 --> 00:09:47.357]  Well, not if Trump wins.
[00:09:47.938 --> 00:09:51.119]  Oh, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, you know, if he loses.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.721]  So this is a big, big deal.
[00:09:57.113 --> 00:10:02.694]  Joe Biden tells CBS News he's not confident at all that there will be a peaceful transfer of power if Donald Trump loses.
[00:10:03.874 --> 00:10:06.295]  But what he really said was wins.
[00:10:07.135 --> 00:10:09.796]  So see the media spinning it for him at every level.
[00:10:10.696 --> 00:10:11.676]  Carrying his water.
[00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:12.596]  Here's what he really said.
[00:10:15.037 --> 00:10:21.378]  Are you confident that there will be a peaceful transfer of power in January 2025?
[00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:25.279]  If Trump wins, no I'm not confident at all.
[00:10:26.175 --> 00:10:28.116]  I mean, if Trump loses, I'm not confident at all.
[00:10:29.297 --> 00:10:30.157]  He means what he says.
[00:10:30.217 --> 00:10:31.338]  We don't take him seriously.
[00:10:31.858 --> 00:10:32.478]  He means it.
[00:10:33.539 --> 00:10:36.200]  All the stuff about if we lose, there'll be a bloodbath.
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.161]  It'll be a storm.
[00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:42.463]  Look what they're trying to do now in the local election districts where people count the votes.
[00:10:42.483 --> 00:10:47.926]  They're putting people in place in states that they're gonna count the votes, right?
[00:10:48.986 --> 00:10:50.087]  So let's unpack that.
[00:10:52.577 --> 00:10:55.921]  Trump said, if all these U.S.
[00:10:55.941 --> 00:11:00.045]  companies, Ford and Chevy, move their electric cars that were given U.S.
[00:11:00.065 --> 00:11:05.851]  government subsidies, electric car manufacturing in Mexico, Musk isn't doing that, he's moving all to Texas, or a lot of it.
[00:11:05.871 --> 00:11:10.636]  It's all, you know, here in the U.S., but some in Europe, but he's moving most of it to Texas.
[00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:14.867]  But Ford and Chevy and others said, we're moving to Mexico.
[00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:25.896]  And Trump said, what, four or five months ago, he said, if you do that, I'm going to put 100% tariff on it, and that's a bloodbath, which is a corporate term in the definition for destroying a company.
[00:11:27.677 --> 00:11:28.798]  That is a corporate term.
[00:11:29.138 --> 00:11:32.421]  A bloodbath in business means exactly that.
[00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:34.783]  So let's unpack the rest of the lies of that clip.
[00:11:37.076 --> 00:11:39.237]  He says, oh, look what they're doing locally to stop votes.
[00:11:39.757 --> 00:11:48.062]  And we have Raskin, who's one of their top statisticians and top strategist, tacticians, in that same interview where he said, we're going to have civil war.
[00:11:48.482 --> 00:11:50.103]  He said, I want illegals to be able to vote.
[00:11:51.773 --> 00:11:53.293]  And they are voting.
[00:11:53.353 --> 00:11:54.654]  They give them voter registration.
[00:11:54.674 --> 00:11:55.774]  They give them driver's license.
[00:11:55.854 --> 00:11:56.374]  They're doing it.
[00:11:57.054 --> 00:12:03.256]  They've got Gallup and Rasmussen and all these undercover reports, too, where they go canvass illegals.
[00:12:03.276 --> 00:12:04.176]  They go, yeah, we're voting.
[00:12:04.616 --> 00:12:06.377]  And it's always 9 to 14 percent.
[00:12:06.417 --> 00:12:08.377]  It's always the lowest 9, the highest 14.
[00:12:10.538 --> 00:12:12.238]  They do national polls of illegal aliens.
[00:12:12.978 --> 00:12:13.758]  They know they're illegal.
[00:12:13.798 --> 00:12:14.399]  They admit they're illegal.
[00:12:14.419 --> 00:12:16.359]  They say, yeah, I'm voting.
[00:12:19.821 --> 00:12:22.484]  So, and that's the ones that are admitting it.
[00:12:22.504 --> 00:12:36.400]  A lot of them are smart enough to know, Sam, they're not, but that's, it's tied to their welfare check, it's tied to their job, that they're given a Democrat handler when they're brought in illegally, and signed up for welfare and also given a job, and then the left skims off that and farms these poor people.
[00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:38.440]  But there's Biden.
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.102]  I mean, what an incredible clip.
[00:12:40.282 --> 00:12:43.986]  I could talk for the next four hours just on this clip about how deception works.
[00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:47.850]  But he slips up at first and says there will not be a peaceful transfer if he wins.
[00:12:48.751 --> 00:12:52.315]  Then he attacks the facts that Trump's and the state's trying to block election fraud.
[00:12:54.377 --> 00:12:55.598]  It's just, it's amazing.
[00:12:55.819 --> 00:12:57.020]  Let's play the clip one more time.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.340]  Here it is.
[00:12:59.878 --> 00:13:03.979]  That there will be a peaceful transfer of power in January 2025.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.921]  If Trump wins, no I'm not confident at all.
[00:13:08.781 --> 00:13:10.721]  I mean if Trump loses, I'm not confident at all.
[00:13:11.902 --> 00:13:13.922]  He means what he says, we don't take him seriously.
[00:13:14.463 --> 00:13:15.063]  He means it.
[00:13:16.124 --> 00:13:18.788]  All the stuff about if we lose, there'll be a bloodbath.
[00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:25.079]  Look what they're trying to do now in the local election districts where people count the votes.
[00:13:25.099 --> 00:13:30.467]  They're putting people in place in states where they're going to count the votes, right?
[00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.871]  Oh, count the votes, right.
[00:13:33.211 --> 00:13:36.613]  Can't trust those pesky states to have someone give you an ID.
[00:13:36.633 --> 00:13:49.539]  But don't worry, FBI said last week there's going to be cyber attacks that don't take down the voting machines, but take down the voter registration computers in those states so they can check that it's a real driver's license or real info.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:50.400]  Hmm.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.163]  Perfect strategic blasting of systems that have integrity for the voting system.
[00:13:57.484 --> 00:13:59.805]  Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
[00:14:04.195 --> 00:14:05.256]  Dakota Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[00:14:07.338 --> 00:14:09.720]  So, when you're conscious, you just see their moves.
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.961]  When you're not, you're like, oh, well, there's gonna be a hack attack.
[00:14:12.642 --> 00:14:18.607]  Don't worry, the vote has integrity, but the system that makes sure it has integrity, it's gonna be shut down.
[00:14:19.207 --> 00:14:21.829]  Ah, and then when that happens, oh, the FBI's so smart.
[00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.671]  Man, they predicted exactly what happened.
[00:14:23.691 --> 00:14:25.352]  How do they know they're so smart?
[00:14:27.134 --> 00:14:28.134]  I think we're stupid, folks.
[00:14:28.495 --> 00:14:30.236]  We're just dialed in and dialed up.
[00:14:30.276 --> 00:14:30.977]  You see it all.
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.542]  And the proof is all the predictions we make basically come true.
[00:14:35.582 --> 00:14:38.544]  Almost all of them, except the ones we make that stop them.
[00:14:40.205 --> 00:14:50.913]  That's the real goal here, is to not sit back and say, see, I told you so, to warn you what's coming and we get awake and we say no and we're watching and we're taking action legally and lawfully and we stop them.
[00:14:53.535 --> 00:14:55.777]  But the caller called in here, she goes, you always see legal and lawful.
[00:14:55.977 --> 00:14:56.617]  You're a wimp.
[00:14:56.698 --> 00:14:57.458]  You don't want violence.
[00:14:57.818 --> 00:14:58.819]  And I said, okay, who do we kill?
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:00.680]  Oh, click.
[00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:02.021]  Bed call.
[00:15:02.502 --> 00:15:02.682]  Click.
[00:15:03.353 --> 00:15:04.634]  Let's see if we can get Alex Jones to call for violence.
[00:15:05.354 --> 00:15:10.397]  If I thought violence was the answer, under the Declaration of Independence, we've been attacked with the poison shots, all of it.
[00:15:10.658 --> 00:15:14.700]  Yeah, sure, we have it right in the law and common sense to defend ourselves.
[00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:17.462]  But you're going to choose the targets?
[00:15:17.482 --> 00:15:20.324]  You're going to launch, in this big complex society, this thing?
[00:15:21.745 --> 00:15:23.386]  The Pentagon will tell you, and they're right.
[00:15:24.363 --> 00:15:26.084]  They said 20 years ago, today it's even more.
[00:15:27.144 --> 00:15:28.584]  90% of war is information.
[00:15:29.105 --> 00:15:30.845]  That's why I named it Info Wars.
[00:15:31.065 --> 00:15:34.246]  27 years ago when I started the website, but only plus 30 plus years.
[00:15:35.807 --> 00:15:37.828]  So I'm doing the war here, okay?
[00:15:38.568 --> 00:15:39.188]  This is the war.
[00:15:39.548 --> 00:15:41.009]  We use the truth and integrity.
[00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:43.290]  It's the Ace of Spades.
[00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.030]  They use lies.
[00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:46.211]  They're little joker cards.
[00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:47.511]  They got unlimited joker cards.
[00:15:49.332 --> 00:15:51.452]  Shoot joker cards at us all day.
[00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:53.033]  It's like a Gatling gun of joker cards.
[00:15:54.838 --> 00:15:55.519]  I'm just BS.
[00:15:55.879 --> 00:16:03.626]  But when you got the Ace of Spades, you go, the Ace of Spades, the Ace of Spades, the only God I need is the Ace of Spades.
[00:16:04.086 --> 00:16:08.671]  Quoting a song, I don't believe that's my God, but I'm quoting a great song.
[00:16:09.792 --> 00:16:12.494]  But we should go out to break with Ace of Spades from the start.
[00:16:12.634 --> 00:16:15.016]  Two minutes of Ace of Spades with Lenny.
[00:16:16.077 --> 00:16:19.861]  Okay, so the fusion of blues and hard rock.
[00:16:19.881 --> 00:16:20.421]  It's amazing.
[00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:24.936]  That's where we are with this.
[00:16:26.457 --> 00:16:28.718]  And these people are nuts.
[00:16:29.438 --> 00:16:33.280]  So remember what Raskin said that I've played probably 10 times the last four days.
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.141]  Yeah, I'm since Sunday, so five days.
[00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:39.143]  Here's Raskin, who is in there quarterbacking.
[00:16:39.183 --> 00:16:42.905]  He's one of the top generals in this and carrying out the globalist orders.
[00:16:42.945 --> 00:16:46.067]  But as a tactician, he's in there.
[00:16:46.587 --> 00:16:49.529]  He's a ground commander of major globalist forces.
[00:16:50.029 --> 00:16:51.730]  Here he is basically saying what Biden just said.
[00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:53.019]  Thank you.
[00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:37.627]  What it's stating and so, you know, they want to kick it to Congress so it's gonna be up to us on January 6th 2025 to tell the rampaging Trump mobs that he's disqualified and then we need bodyguards for everybody in Civil War conditions all because the nine justices not all of them, but these justices who have Not many cases to look at every year not that much work to do a huge staff great protection simply do not want
[00:17:38.187 --> 00:17:45.330]  I mean, I've already unpacked that five times at least, but I can't let those lies go out and not unpack it again in case new viewers are here, which I know there are by the millions.
[00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:50.613]  A lot of folks just come through the show, you know, once a month, every few weeks, and they listen, so our audience is very diverse.
[00:18:06.977 --> 00:18:09.860]  That was 55 seconds superior horseman-er.
[00:18:10.721 --> 00:18:13.303]  Trump was never charged with January 6th or any insurrection.
[00:18:14.425 --> 00:18:21.292]  Trump was taken off the ballot in multiple states, Colorado, Maine, and others, with the lie that he was guilty of something.
[00:18:22.172 --> 00:18:24.515]  You'd be convicted under that to be removed.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.481]  He's not even charged!
[00:18:26.982 --> 00:18:29.124]  He goes, oh, the Supreme Court knows, it's on its face.
[00:18:29.625 --> 00:18:33.749]  Oh, you know, you know, it's, it's, it's all, no, it's like, it's well known that pigs fly.
[00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.854]  It's well known the Easter Bunny's real and Santa Claus is real and Lucky Charms is real and all.
[00:18:39.155 --> 00:18:40.156]  The Tooth Fairy's real.
[00:18:40.397 --> 00:18:42.439]  Razz is like, it's well known the Tooth Fairy's, you know, real.
[00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:50.109]  And then, oh, because the Supreme Court, they've got all this protection implying they're being threatened by Trump.
[00:18:50.309 --> 00:18:51.410]  See, everything he says is a lie.
[00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:55.714]  Every second is just a lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.
[00:18:55.794 --> 00:19:03.320]  You know, they've got great staff, great protection, but they just won't do the right thing and take Trump off the ballot when the law says you can't do it.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.081]  But he just says 14th Amendment, it's clear.
[00:19:06.783 --> 00:19:09.565]  Convicted of insurrection, it's clear.
[00:19:09.785 --> 00:19:10.746]  He's not convicted.
[00:19:10.786 --> 00:19:11.847]  He goes, it's just clear.
[00:19:14.284 --> 00:19:19.987]  No, it's clear that you're a communist and so is your father, a very famous one, and that you're an enemy of this country, you sack of garbage.
[00:19:22.008 --> 00:19:32.094]  Okay, so let's shift gears now to the Stolen Valor fiasco that should disqualify Tim Walz.
[00:19:33.171 --> 00:19:38.973]  Now, he's not just super aggressive, castrate children, little children, down at age six.
[00:19:39.833 --> 00:19:41.173]  He's not just anti-gun.
[00:19:41.234 --> 00:19:43.974]  He didn't just do his four-day stand-down when they burned down Minnesota.
[00:19:46.855 --> 00:19:47.736]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[00:19:48.096 --> 00:19:50.076]  I mean, this guy is super uber.
[00:19:50.136 --> 00:19:52.717]  His wife opened the windows up to smell the burning tires.
[00:19:52.737 --> 00:19:54.778]  I mean, we have video of her saying it plenty yesterday.
[00:19:55.178 --> 00:19:56.998]  I mean, this is cuckoo level.
[00:19:57.299 --> 00:19:58.479]  This is Bernie Sanders
[00:20:00.185 --> 00:20:02.207]  Waving around dead ducks and a shotgun.
[00:20:02.247 --> 00:20:04.570]  Look, I'm with you, dead ducks and a shotgun.
[00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.772]  I'm like you, dead ducks and a shotgun.
[00:20:09.855 --> 00:20:12.518]  I shoot ducks, and I shoot patriots.
[00:20:13.178 --> 00:20:13.699]  They're freedoms.
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.483]  So now he's been caught in all these interviews.
[00:20:18.424 --> 00:20:20.145]  Newspaper interviews, combat veteran.
[00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:23.309]  But he can deny he said that, but we've got all these videos now.
[00:20:24.639 --> 00:20:31.044]  And it turns out it's been a scandal for over a decade about this, and the Democrats didn't even do their due diligence to check.
[00:20:31.625 --> 00:20:35.788]  Or I guess all their potential candidates have so much dirt, I guess they thought he was the best one.
[00:20:36.749 --> 00:20:45.256]  Look at this, 2009 video shows, so that's 15 years ago, shows veteran confronting Tim Wall's staff over stolen valor allegations.
[00:20:45.937 --> 00:20:47.738]  And these are folks that were in the unit with him.
[00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:50.080]  He abandoned them.
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:50.701]  He didn't just
[00:20:52.153 --> 00:20:58.179]  Claim he was a combat vet, he abandoned them when they went to war, and then sat around and said he was in war.
[00:20:59.119 --> 00:21:01.482]  That's a real cherry on top.
[00:21:02.543 --> 00:21:03.664]  I don't know how he survives this.
[00:21:04.384 --> 00:21:06.867]  But even if you tune into Fox News, CNN, they're not talking about this right now.
[00:21:06.887 --> 00:21:10.390]  Oh, it's how great he is, and how folksy it is, and how wonderful he is.
[00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.911]  But it's all coming out.
[00:21:11.951 --> 00:21:12.792]  They can't stop this.
[00:21:12.832 --> 00:21:16.315]  So, we got three new clips, but let's play the first clip.
[00:21:16.355 --> 00:21:17.476]  Yesterday, him talking to a crowd.
[00:21:18.419 --> 00:21:19.640]  About how he's a combat veteran.
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.581]  And the whole record he says is a lie.
[00:21:21.861 --> 00:21:23.342]  They've pulled up his military record.
[00:21:23.843 --> 00:21:26.565]  And then we'll go to the new clips and his military record.
[00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:26.845]  Here it is.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:34.963]  Hope woke up like many of you did five weeks ago and said, Dad, you're the only person I know who's in elected office.
[00:21:34.983 --> 00:21:36.644]  You need to stop what's happening with this.
[00:21:36.724 --> 00:21:38.465]  I'll take my kick in the butt for the NRA.
[00:21:38.505 --> 00:21:40.626]  I spent 25 years in the Army, and I hunt.
[00:21:40.986 --> 00:21:43.408]  And I gave the money back, and I'll tell you what I have been doing.
[00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:47.770]  I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks.
[00:21:47.831 --> 00:21:49.071]  We can do CDC research.
[00:21:49.311 --> 00:21:56.676]  We can make sure we don't have reciprocal carry among states, and we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.
[00:21:59.562 --> 00:22:02.564]  What's your background, and how did somebody from Nebraska end up in Minnesota?
[00:22:02.684 --> 00:22:05.145]  Yeah, well, my wife's from Minnesota, so she took me there.
[00:22:05.205 --> 00:22:12.008]  Actually, it was based on the educational system in Minnesota was one that we kind of aspired to teach in, so I ended up in southern Minnesota.
[00:22:12.028 --> 00:22:14.489]  My wife's been there for many generations.
[00:22:14.829 --> 00:22:15.889]  And your military background?
[00:22:16.109 --> 00:22:19.031]  I spent 24 years in the National Guard, some of that full-time.
[00:22:19.111 --> 00:22:20.071]  I was an artilleryman.
[00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:23.492]  I deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, my battalion provided.
[00:22:25.359 --> 00:22:26.000]  Good morning.
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.140]  Thank you very much for this opportunity.
[00:23:02.768 --> 00:23:03.529]  He's a fraud.
[00:23:03.989 --> 00:23:04.729]  She's a fraud.
[00:23:04.769 --> 00:23:08.412]  And there he runs off from people asking questions about a stolen Valor.
[00:23:16.257 --> 00:23:16.898]  Governor!
[00:23:17.758 --> 00:23:20.420]  Fans accuse you of stolen Valor!
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.361]  Your response!
[00:23:27.465 --> 00:23:30.627]  Now the video of him being confronted by veterans in 2009
[00:23:33.948 --> 00:23:34.988]  Is about six minutes long.
[00:23:35.088 --> 00:23:40.570]  So, we're live now, but in post, we post this to X. We'll take the juicy clips out of that and put it in there.
[00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:42.650]  Later that time, I'll put the thing live on there to millions.
[00:23:43.331 --> 00:23:45.131]  But you need to get this out, obviously.
[00:23:45.171 --> 00:23:46.772]  But you can tell he's not getting away with this.
[00:23:47.212 --> 00:23:48.552]  They have just screwed the pooch again.
[00:23:49.032 --> 00:23:52.333]  But let's go back to the video of him on C-SPAN.
[00:23:52.353 --> 00:23:56.134]  Because the crew pointed this out in my ear when we were playing it.
[00:23:56.554 --> 00:23:58.195]  And I thought that too when I saw it last night.
[00:23:59.462 --> 00:24:04.685]  There's the big tell when he talks about his unit was in combat and that was his service.
[00:24:05.025 --> 00:24:07.667]  He gulps and kind of does the tell.
[00:24:08.627 --> 00:24:12.349]  Like if I said, you know, I beat Mike Tyson one time in arm wrestling.
[00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:15.871]  I beat Mike Tyson arm wrestling contest.
[00:24:15.891 --> 00:24:17.372]  No, I didn't.
[00:24:19.373 --> 00:24:20.134]  Rip my arm off.
[00:24:21.455 --> 00:24:21.615]  So.
[00:24:22.839 --> 00:24:25.040]  Again, this is, or I beat Mike Tyson.
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.820]  I beat Mike Tyson, he was 20 years old, it's prime.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.161]  Go ahead and roll the video again.
[00:24:29.181 --> 00:24:30.561]  I mean, look at this face of a liar.
[00:24:31.001 --> 00:24:31.261]  Play it.
[00:24:32.362 --> 00:24:33.542]  There for many generations.
[00:24:33.882 --> 00:24:34.922]  And your military background?
[00:24:35.163 --> 00:24:38.063]  I spent 24 years in the National Guard, some of that full time.
[00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:39.124]  I was an artilleryman.
[00:24:39.184 --> 00:24:42.525]  I deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, my battalion provided.
[00:24:44.241 --> 00:24:45.021]  And your military background?
[00:24:45.061 --> 00:24:45.101]  Um...
[00:24:59.953 --> 00:25:01.054]  Mmm, yeah, play it again.
[00:25:01.575 --> 00:25:04.478]  This is, this, this... They're for many generations.
[00:25:04.819 --> 00:25:05.860]  And your military background?
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.023]  I spent 24 years in the National Guard, some of that full-time.
[00:25:09.084 --> 00:25:10.065]  I was an artilleryman.
[00:25:10.125 --> 00:25:13.509]  I deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, my battalion provided.
[00:25:16.392 --> 00:25:19.396]  Now play it through without the, with the, play the clip through.
[00:25:31.104 --> 00:25:32.185]  You gotta love our computers.
[00:25:32.365 --> 00:25:38.489]  We have, like, $70,000 computers, which are great, but you gotta pay $500,000 for one that doesn't do this.
[00:25:39.069 --> 00:25:44.193]  It's a little... If I ever get plenty of money around here, we're gonna get the big, fancy, super-badass systems that don't do this.
[00:25:44.213 --> 00:25:44.593]  But it's okay.
[00:25:45.193 --> 00:25:45.714]  It's ready now.
[00:25:46.194 --> 00:25:46.494]  Here it is.
[00:25:46.534 --> 00:25:46.734]  Play it.
[00:26:01.244 --> 00:26:02.405]  There for many generations.
[00:26:02.745 --> 00:26:03.805]  And your military background?
[00:26:04.025 --> 00:26:06.947]  I spent 24 years in the National Guard, some of that full-time.
[00:26:07.027 --> 00:26:07.987]  I was an artilleryman.
[00:26:08.048 --> 00:26:10.289]  I deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.
[00:26:10.329 --> 00:26:18.933]  My battalion provided base security throughout the European theater from Turkey to England in the early stages of the war in Afghanistan.
[00:26:19.193 --> 00:26:21.714]  And that same battalion is now in Iraq at this time.
[00:26:22.035 --> 00:26:24.516]  Next call, Lawton, Oklahoma for Congressman Tim Walz.
[00:26:24.576 --> 00:26:24.756]  Oh my God.
[00:26:24.776 --> 00:26:27.377]  I mean, if they put him on the stage with J.D.
[00:26:27.417 --> 00:26:30.619]  Vance, who is an admitted decorated Marine combat veteran,
[00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:33.751]  Which he never even talks about.
[00:26:33.771 --> 00:26:41.535]  And this guy also, because I read that Hillbilly book that Vance wrote, Hillbilly Elegy.
[00:26:42.495 --> 00:26:53.381]  And I hadn't read it until I met him a month before he was picked up in Detroit at a TPUSA action event that I was a speaker right before him.
[00:26:54.402 --> 00:26:55.662]  And I thought, well, I better get this book.
[00:26:55.722 --> 00:26:56.863]  So I ordered it and read it.
[00:26:58.124 --> 00:26:58.224]  And
[00:26:59.505 --> 00:27:04.147]  It's very loving how he talks about being a hillbilly and how they are, but he makes fun of himself.
[00:27:04.167 --> 00:27:04.688]  That's a thing.
[00:27:06.108 --> 00:27:09.190]  Hillbillies are similar to Southerners, that we make fun of ourselves.
[00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.051]  It's a self-deprecating thing.
[00:27:11.731 --> 00:27:14.092]  Walls turns that around that he's attacking his heritage.
[00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:14.652]  It's the opposite.
[00:27:14.672 --> 00:27:17.594]  He went back where he was from to try to empower those people.
[00:27:19.124 --> 00:27:23.607]  Just because I make fun of the Beverly Hillbillies is because I am from Beverly Hillbillies, folks.
[00:27:23.707 --> 00:27:24.728]  That's where I come from.
[00:27:25.148 --> 00:27:25.809]  And I'm proud of it.
[00:27:26.089 --> 00:27:28.191]  But I'll sure as hell make fun of it all day long.
[00:27:28.471 --> 00:27:29.572]  Would you like a possum?
[00:27:30.032 --> 00:27:30.652]  We'll be right back.
[00:27:30.672 --> 00:27:31.113]  Stay with us.
[00:27:31.933 --> 00:27:32.794]  Nitric Boost.
[00:27:33.735 --> 00:27:34.215]  Turmeric 95.
[00:27:36.474 --> 00:27:39.377]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[00:27:40.338 --> 00:27:45.323]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[00:27:45.823 --> 00:27:52.970]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[00:27:53.531 --> 00:27:55.513]  They let us private label their products.
[00:27:55.533 --> 00:27:56.413]  That's why you've already heard of
[00:27:57.282 --> 00:27:58.323]  Bodies Old Turmeric Formula?
[00:27:58.643 --> 00:28:01.406]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[00:28:01.646 --> 00:28:02.947]  This is just their brand of that.
[00:28:03.308 --> 00:28:06.611]  And so, it is available under Turmeric 95.
[00:28:06.991 --> 00:28:07.611]  That's the name.
[00:28:07.852 --> 00:28:13.537]  So, we're sold out of bodies, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated
[00:28:14.077 --> 00:28:16.918]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the great Lemmy bringing us in.
[00:28:16.938 --> 00:28:17.879]  A little motorhead for you.
[00:28:17.899 --> 00:28:18.099]  All right.
[00:28:44.204 --> 00:28:45.365]  All hell's breaking loose.
[00:28:45.865 --> 00:28:48.087]  Tim Walz, who just joined us, is destroyed.
[00:28:49.608 --> 00:28:51.069]  I hope they keep him on the ticket, actually.
[00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:54.571]  I mean, total stolen valor of the worst type.
[00:28:55.031 --> 00:28:56.652]  Resigned his commission at wartime.
[00:28:57.213 --> 00:29:02.156]  The most... Look, people can put up with it in the enlisted class, not in the officer class.
[00:29:02.296 --> 00:29:06.339]  It is... It's as bad as... It's the worst thing you can do.
[00:29:06.879 --> 00:29:10.382]  And then he added the cherry on top with whipped cream and nuts.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:12.560]  We're good to go.
[00:29:32.583 --> 00:29:34.384]  More of that coming up with Laura Logan.
[00:29:34.664 --> 00:29:42.709]  We've got Tommy Robbins joining us with huge, big developments where they're openly saying they're going to arrest anybody that shows the Muslims rioting and engaging in crime.
[00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:44.871]  There is no law that says that.
[00:29:44.931 --> 00:29:45.932]  They are just desperate.
[00:29:46.992 --> 00:29:48.013]  This is wild.
[00:29:50.214 --> 00:29:51.655]  And so much more today.
[00:29:53.796 --> 00:29:59.020]  But I wanted to get Dr. Kirk Elliott, who's an amazing economist, degreed economist, and degreed theologian,
[00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:10.160]  I've known who he is for 25 years, and I don't know what was wrong with me not having a gold or silver sponsor for 12 years because I couldn't find one that wouldn't give people a good deal.
[00:30:10.781 --> 00:30:14.101]  He's now the biggest silver broker in the country, an overnight 25-year success story.
[00:30:14.802 --> 00:30:21.383]  And the good news is he's seeing the biggest response he's ever seen this week of people wanting silver and wanting gold.
[00:30:21.443 --> 00:30:21.923]  That's good.
[00:30:22.504 --> 00:30:23.524]  And we'll do a pitch for it.
[00:30:23.544 --> 00:30:24.284]  He's a great sponsor.
[00:30:24.324 --> 00:30:25.084]  He keeps us on air.
[00:30:26.144 --> 00:30:27.585]  But I'm going to tell you this again.
[00:30:28.664 --> 00:30:44.595]  I have had, in just the last month, two major gold companies offer me five times the money Kirk Elliott funds us with, he's a substantial funder by the way, to come on air and just send you to them so they can rip the living snot out of you.
[00:30:45.056 --> 00:30:56.024]  With Dr. Kirk Elliott, it is cut and dry, 8%, whatever silver and gold wholesale is, and they don't even sell it to you, they have top depositories.
[00:30:56.963 --> 00:30:58.104]  We're good to go.
[00:31:17.526 --> 00:31:20.869]  And nobody has the 4.7 to 4.9 star reviews he's got.
[00:31:20.889 --> 00:31:23.251]  You've got to dig for hours to find some pissy review.
[00:31:23.691 --> 00:31:27.154]  I mean, people would review a cure for cancer as bad, you know, even if it works.
[00:31:27.534 --> 00:31:31.937]  But the point is, he's got a 97% rating.
[00:31:32.438 --> 00:31:33.458]  He's the place to call.
[00:31:33.559 --> 00:31:35.560]  He's the place to get gold and silver.
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:36.981]  He'll tell you, don't get gold.
[00:31:37.482 --> 00:31:38.943]  That's up, but not as much as silver.
[00:31:39.463 --> 00:31:41.004]  And again, silver and gold went down a little bit.
[00:31:41.044 --> 00:31:41.945]  That was a buying opportunity.
[00:31:41.985 --> 00:31:42.826]  It's already gone back up.
[00:31:44.383 --> 00:31:46.084]  But I want to get him back on with us.
[00:31:46.104 --> 00:31:47.965]  He was on Monday and that interview went viral.
[00:31:48.025 --> 00:31:55.028]  Millions of views on Exelon to break down the new developments of the contagion that we know is going to continue on.
[00:31:55.108 --> 00:31:58.589]  And will the crash come soon before the election or after?
[00:31:58.629 --> 00:32:02.671]  Will they hand Trump a hand grenade with the pin pulled out of it?
[00:32:03.331 --> 00:32:04.992]  So Kirk, you sent me a lot here.
[00:32:05.012 --> 00:32:07.573]  We've only got 25 minutes to try to blitz through this quickly.
[00:32:13.351 --> 00:32:14.231]  Dot, stop right there.
[00:32:14.872 --> 00:32:16.392]  Today, when it rains, it pours.
[00:32:16.412 --> 00:32:17.493]  We've got a technical difficulty.
[00:32:17.533 --> 00:32:18.453]  Can you unmute yourself?
[00:32:21.654 --> 00:32:22.195]  I'm unmuted.
[00:32:22.335 --> 00:32:22.855]  Can you hear me?
[00:32:22.875 --> 00:32:23.275]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:32:23.295 --> 00:32:23.615]  Start over.
[00:32:23.635 --> 00:32:23.855]  Go ahead.
[00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:24.556]  Okay.
[00:32:24.976 --> 00:32:29.418]  Yeah, there's no way we're going to get through everything that I sent you, but things are happening so fast, Alex.
[00:32:29.478 --> 00:32:31.599]  Like, out of control fast.
[00:32:31.699 --> 00:32:40.322]  So, when we spoke earlier this week, Japan had basically said, we're going to raise rates a quarter of a point.
[00:32:40.362 --> 00:32:42.083]  Why did they have to do that?
[00:32:42.683 --> 00:32:51.685]  Because their inflation is so bad in Japan that they had to do it or else they go into an inflationary spiral like Venezuela or Zimbabwe, right?
[00:32:51.745 --> 00:32:53.425]  So they said, we're going to do this.
[00:32:53.545 --> 00:32:54.525]  And what happened?
[00:32:55.025 --> 00:32:57.386]  The markets collapsed globally.
[00:32:58.066 --> 00:33:02.706]  The largest bank in Japan down 21% in one day, right?
[00:33:03.007 --> 00:33:04.667]  But they had to do this to save the yen.
[00:33:05.047 --> 00:33:06.427]  So here was their dilemma.
[00:33:06.867 --> 00:33:08.788]  Do we raise rates to save the yen?
[00:33:09.308 --> 00:33:11.088]  But if we raise rates, we're going to kill
[00:33:11.548 --> 00:33:16.576]  Not just the Japanese economy, but the global economy because of the yen carry trade.
[00:33:16.896 --> 00:33:19.120]  So they decided, OK, we're going to raise rates.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:27.212]  Well, OK, so then after the mayhem, because the Dow was down almost a thousand points,
[00:33:27.552 --> 00:33:29.233]  That that same day, right?
[00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:31.015]  Banks were just falling apart.
[00:33:31.035 --> 00:33:32.736]  You know, it's just terrible.
[00:33:33.077 --> 00:33:45.186]  So then, Uchida, the Bank of Japan director, yesterday said, we're actually not going to raise rates in the midst of a huge market collapse and when things are so bad.
[00:33:45.547 --> 00:33:48.249]  So they had to capitulate and they turned it around.
[00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:49.850]  But here's the point of all of this.
[00:33:50.531 --> 00:33:53.233]  That inevitable D-Day is coming.
[00:33:53.931 --> 00:34:06.345]  Because they have so much inflation in Japan, if they go into an inflationary spiral like Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe, it lights out.
[00:34:06.765 --> 00:34:11.691]  So you look at Japan, Alex, and we can compare and contrast that to the Fed.
[00:34:12.251 --> 00:34:18.037]  So both of them, Japan and the U.S., are in a lose-lose situation, and here's why.
[00:34:18.838 --> 00:34:32.612]  If the Fed says that they're going to cut rates like they did, they said they're going to do that in September, and now they're proposing an emergency rate cut, you know, go much more than what they thought, maybe 50 basis points, a half a percent or more.
[00:34:33.132 --> 00:34:42.054]  Okay, if they cut rates aggressively right now, markets will tank further because they risk a resurgence of inflation.
[00:34:42.974 --> 00:34:52.136]  But here's where the investing public and the hedge funds and banks all over the world say, ooh, if the Fed lowers rates that much, why is that?
[00:34:52.436 --> 00:34:54.357]  Because they're facing recession.
[00:34:54.717 --> 00:34:56.577]  They need to stimulate the economy.
[00:34:56.617 --> 00:34:58.217]  See, that's a lose-lose.
[00:34:59.478 --> 00:35:00.778]  But here's the bigger issue.
[00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:02.522]  Cutting U.S.
[00:35:02.622 --> 00:35:12.390]  rates will only make this yen carry trade unwinding even worse, likely sending the Nasdaq into bear market territory like nothing we've ever seen.
[00:35:13.397 --> 00:35:17.199]  The Nikkei in Japan into a correction like nothing we've ever seen.
[00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:19.720]  But here's the catch-22.
[00:35:20.441 --> 00:35:25.683]  If the Fed doesn't cut rates right now, recession fears are going to continue to mount.
[00:35:25.743 --> 00:35:30.645]  No rate cuts mean more worry about rising unemployment, which is now at a three-year high.
[00:35:31.086 --> 00:35:37.569]  The Fed must pick between market and inflation instability or a potential recession.
[00:35:38.297 --> 00:35:38.477]  Right.
[00:35:38.537 --> 00:35:43.021]  So and even if they pick the right form, we're still going to end up in recession.
[00:35:43.061 --> 00:35:43.241]  Right.
[00:35:43.261 --> 00:35:44.742]  This is the catch 22.
[00:35:45.263 --> 00:35:47.265]  And this is going to be a really bumpy road.
[00:35:47.805 --> 00:35:50.527]  So I sent you this this chart.
[00:35:50.607 --> 00:35:53.550]  It's under the market collapse section.
[00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:59.715]  It says a stock market collapse appears imminent worse than 2008 and 2009.
[00:36:00.376 --> 00:36:00.596]  Right.
[00:36:00.696 --> 00:36:05.060]  So so when we look at some of these pictures, this chart
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:10.623]  Is absolutely insane bonkers how history repeats itself.
[00:36:11.484 --> 00:36:18.708]  So if you go back to 2009, you look at the chart and how we exploded to the upside and then came crashing down.
[00:36:19.355 --> 00:36:23.837]  The chart today looks almost exactly the same Alex.
[00:36:23.977 --> 00:36:27.859]  We're going to do this live on air for the crew because you sent us so much stuff.
[00:36:28.199 --> 00:36:29.399]  They're not sure which order.
[00:36:29.419 --> 00:36:30.700]  So watch your screen.
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:33.061]  You're getting a feed of me so you can see this.
[00:36:33.121 --> 00:36:33.701]  I can see it.
[00:36:33.801 --> 00:36:35.342]  We'll just go through every chart here together.
[00:36:35.522 --> 00:36:36.842]  Is this the chart you want to show?
[00:36:38.223 --> 00:36:38.423]  Nope.
[00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:40.404]  It's okay.
[00:36:40.424 --> 00:36:40.984]  We'll just keep going.
[00:36:41.004 --> 00:36:42.525]  Let's do all this live on air.
[00:36:43.527 --> 00:36:43.767]  Okay.
[00:36:43.887 --> 00:36:45.028]  We'll just, cause it's no big deal.
[00:36:45.048 --> 00:36:45.629]  We'll start doing this.
[00:36:45.649 --> 00:36:47.050]  We'll actually do preparation on it.
[00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:47.891]  It's that one right there.
[00:36:47.911 --> 00:36:48.991]  The Defcon 3 one.
[00:36:49.012 --> 00:36:49.752]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:36:49.832 --> 00:36:50.032]  Yep.
[00:36:50.653 --> 00:36:52.154]  So, so check this out.
[00:36:52.655 --> 00:36:58.800]  So 2008, 2009, you had ups and downs and then it exploded to the upside and then came crashing down.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.982]  The chart on the right is today, right?
[00:37:03.022 --> 00:37:05.044]  Don't those charts look very, very similar?
[00:37:05.464 --> 00:37:06.205]  So here's the thing.
[00:37:06.325 --> 00:37:09.867]  When history repeats itself, where does that put the Dow?
[00:37:10.607 --> 00:37:14.710]  Close to like 24,000 if history repeats itself.
[00:37:15.331 --> 00:37:17.252]  And why does history repeat itself?
[00:37:17.312 --> 00:37:19.473]  It's because markets get overbought.
[00:37:19.874 --> 00:37:23.316]  Public perception gets, you know, shellacked.
[00:37:23.896 --> 00:37:29.483]  Because in 2008-2009, the subprime lending crisis, people lost confidence in the system.
[00:37:29.923 --> 00:37:34.068]  Today, Alex, people are losing confidence in the system.
[00:37:34.088 --> 00:37:36.711]  So here's another thing.
[00:37:38.613 --> 00:37:40.674]  Why are they losing confidence in the system?
[00:37:41.334 --> 00:37:47.576]  The chart right above that, which is, it talks about a Black Swan event, right?
[00:37:47.676 --> 00:37:52.738]  So, the Kobesi letter, it's this amazing research, right?
[00:37:53.258 --> 00:37:56.719]  So, there's an index called
[00:37:57.379 --> 00:38:00.460]  The Cambria Tail Risk ETF, right?
[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.820]  So it jumped up by four and a half percent.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:03.660]  What is this?
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.180]  What is this index?
[00:38:05.801 --> 00:38:10.241]  It basically talks about the propensity for a black swan event to happen.
[00:38:10.721 --> 00:38:13.242]  It's buying protection against a big sell off.
[00:38:13.782 --> 00:38:20.183]  This is the worst this has been since like 2020 during COVID, right?
[00:38:20.263 --> 00:38:24.284]  People are expecting something bad to happen.
[00:38:25.345 --> 00:38:30.270]  They're just expecting it, and perception is reality in the investing world.
[00:38:31.451 --> 00:38:38.179]  Regardless, if bank stocks are already in serious trouble, there's already failures, if they lose a bunch of their investment, that's going to trigger more bank failure.
[00:38:39.665 --> 00:38:41.447]  Yeah, it is going to trigger more bank failure.
[00:38:41.567 --> 00:38:47.433]  And the yen carry trade, it's worth a one-minute review of what that is.
[00:38:47.593 --> 00:38:51.677]  Because we talked about it on Monday, but I know there's millions of people watching, right?
[00:38:52.337 --> 00:38:55.841]  Max Keiser said yesterday, it's all about the yen carry trade.
[00:38:57.506 --> 00:39:03.848]  This is the pendulum shifting moment, Alex, that we've been talking about often, right?
[00:39:04.128 --> 00:39:09.150]  So how could the Japanese yen actually impact the global market this much?
[00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:14.772]  Well, for decades, Japan has had so much inflation, they've kept rates artificially low.
[00:39:14.892 --> 00:39:21.094]  Even during COVID, their official treasury rate was negative, Alex, not zero, it was negative.
[00:39:21.594 --> 00:39:21.935]  We're good.
[00:39:38.251 --> 00:39:49.014]  And you can say, I can go to Japan and borrow money at zero, and in supposedly a risk-free investment, I could take that money I borrowed at zero, put it in U.S.
[00:39:49.114 --> 00:39:55.296]  Treasuries at 4.5%, and that's a 4.5% gain on what's considered zero risk.
[00:39:55.776 --> 00:39:58.877]  Now, this is what a traditional advisor would tell you, but it's like,
[00:40:00.137 --> 00:40:01.718]  I would say that U.S.
[00:40:01.778 --> 00:40:05.179]  Treasuries are not a zero-risk option right now, right?
[00:40:05.239 --> 00:40:07.260]  So this is the yen carry trade.
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:09.061]  How big is it?
[00:40:09.081 --> 00:40:10.401]  20 trillion dollars.
[00:40:10.921 --> 00:40:13.602]  It's basically all of the Japanese economy.
[00:40:13.642 --> 00:40:17.524]  So when it gets in trouble and it's this globalist free cash machine, what does that signify?
[00:40:19.326 --> 00:40:23.088]  Oh, that signifies that capital is going to dry up globally.
[00:40:23.488 --> 00:40:34.754]  If these big countries and companies and hedge funds can't get money at 0% to inject in other parts of the economy to try to invest, it's lights out.
[00:40:34.834 --> 00:40:38.736]  So it's always been like a secret QE, Q2, Q3.
[00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:41.117]  It's always been a little secret injector point.
[00:40:42.441 --> 00:40:45.664]  Yeah, it has been and it's been secret to the public.
[00:40:46.005 --> 00:40:48.067]  Hasn't been secret to banks and hedge funds, right?
[00:40:48.147 --> 00:40:50.409]  This is the mechanism that they use.
[00:40:51.110 --> 00:41:00.599]  So the last so now what happens is we're starting to see flight capital into the precious metals market because you don't have this anymore.
[00:41:00.639 --> 00:41:01.921]  People are looking for safety.
[00:41:01.941 --> 00:41:02.821]  And so I've gotten
[00:41:03.582 --> 00:41:04.883]  A bajillion calls.
[00:41:04.903 --> 00:41:12.907]  And it's like, Kirk, you've been saying that gold and silver go up during times of crisis and uncertainty and turbulence, and yet gold and silver came down.
[00:41:13.487 --> 00:41:14.588]  Why is that?
[00:41:15.288 --> 00:41:15.788]  Right?
[00:41:16.289 --> 00:41:18.910]  So, okay, so let's look at this chart here.
[00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:23.332]  So we're looking at this chart, and gold is near an all-time high, right?
[00:41:23.372 --> 00:41:24.893]  And silver is following right along.
[00:41:24.993 --> 00:41:28.095]  It's not at an all-time high, but it's outpacing gold.
[00:41:28.535 --> 00:41:32.017]  Well, the last time gold hit these levels,
[00:41:33.041 --> 00:41:36.702]  The 12-month Stoche RSI crossed this 50% level.
[00:41:36.763 --> 00:41:38.783]  Basically, it's a bunch of technical garbage.
[00:41:38.863 --> 00:41:41.724]  But the last time it did this, gold went up 450%.
[00:41:41.764 --> 00:41:42.945]  The time before that, it gained 1800%.
[00:41:43.005 --> 00:41:43.125]  Alex,
[00:41:48.727 --> 00:41:50.209]  We're here again now.
[00:41:50.569 --> 00:41:50.769]  Right.
[00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:58.776]  So so this is where in a flight for quality type of an investment opportunity, gold and silver absolutely shine.
[00:41:59.197 --> 00:41:59.377]  Right.
[00:41:59.397 --> 00:42:06.984]  So but so why did gold and silver come down during this big market correction that we saw over this this last week?
[00:42:07.324 --> 00:42:08.986]  But it's already but it's already bumped back up.
[00:42:09.853 --> 00:42:11.294]  Oh, it's bumping back.
[00:42:11.474 --> 00:42:19.917]  I mean, today, gold's up almost $30, silver's up like 70 cents, because it was that initial knee-jerk reaction, the sell-off, right?
[00:42:19.977 --> 00:42:27.700]  It's like, when people don't know what to do because everything's falling apart, they basically capitulate, and it's like, I'm selling everything.
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.260]  I'm just getting out of Dodge.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:30.201]  I don't know what to keep.
[00:42:30.341 --> 00:42:31.461]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:42:31.501 --> 00:42:32.461]  So I'm going to sell.
[00:42:32.561 --> 00:42:32.782]  Right.
[00:42:32.862 --> 00:42:34.382]  So that's part of it.
[00:42:34.482 --> 00:42:35.723]  But that's a small part.
[00:42:36.123 --> 00:42:43.645]  The retail investor is a very small part of the gold and silver purchasing mechanism globally.
[00:42:44.085 --> 00:42:45.466]  Here's what happened.
[00:42:45.506 --> 00:42:55.169]  Gold and silver came down because as the markets were coming down, the normal traditional equity and debt markets, margin calls were basically
[00:42:55.849 --> 00:43:00.292]  Hold on, so people got this margin calls they had to sell.
[00:43:00.332 --> 00:43:06.776]  That's what, you know, I'm a layman but I was about to say that was that's what I thought is people needed money so they had to cash out some of their gold and silver.
[00:43:07.916 --> 00:43:08.456]  Yeah.
[00:43:08.556 --> 00:43:12.958]  And the big brokerage firm says, oh, wait, you've got this gold and silver and everything else is falling down.
[00:43:13.118 --> 00:43:15.159]  We've got to institute these margin calls.
[00:43:15.199 --> 00:43:16.299]  You're coming down too much.
[00:43:16.359 --> 00:43:17.940]  We're going to force you to liquidate.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:18.880]  Here's the thing.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.942]  When somebody gets a margin call, they don't want to sell that asset.
[00:43:23.382 --> 00:43:27.964]  The broker dealers force them to sell the asset in a margin call.
[00:43:28.004 --> 00:43:30.085]  So they had to do this for selling.
[00:43:30.485 --> 00:43:30.925]  And now
[00:43:31.465 --> 00:43:37.188]  When reality is setting in and they're saying, what, are we really going to have this emergency rate cut?
[00:43:37.628 --> 00:43:40.769]  Is the Fed actually going to lower rates in September?
[00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:44.831]  And is it going to be half a point instead of, you know, a quarter point?
[00:43:45.271 --> 00:43:50.474]  Well, that signifies that they are so scared about a future recession that
[00:43:52.075 --> 00:43:55.217]  The gold and silver now, being this flight for quality, is starting to go up.
[00:43:55.237 --> 00:43:56.178]  Sure, so let's talk about this.
[00:43:56.218 --> 00:44:01.061]  Let's go back to that graph, then, that you were saying two times in the past has happened, gold exploded.
[00:44:01.101 --> 00:44:01.742]  Explain that to me.
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:06.743]  So there's this technical level, right?
[00:44:06.843 --> 00:44:09.025]  It's the S-T-O-C-H-R-S-I.
[00:44:09.085 --> 00:44:13.708]  Basically, I don't know what that acronym stands for, but it's what technical traders look at.
[00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:20.914]  Well, it has to do with not just supply and demand, but how much people are purchasing, what's available, all this stuff, right?
[00:44:20.994 --> 00:44:23.777]  So once it hits that level,
[00:44:24.577 --> 00:44:30.201]  In the past, once it's hit that level, gold bumped up 450% after that.
[00:44:30.541 --> 00:44:33.943]  The time before, it bumped up 1,800% after that.
[00:44:34.384 --> 00:44:35.164]  And you know what, Alex?
[00:44:35.364 --> 00:44:37.366]  We're at that level.
[00:44:37.806 --> 00:44:40.308]  So we can't ever make guarantees, right?
[00:44:40.348 --> 00:44:41.048]  We're not God.
[00:44:41.108 --> 00:44:42.349]  We don't control the markets.
[00:44:42.729 --> 00:44:47.032]  But these technical patterns tend to repeat themselves.
[00:44:47.492 --> 00:44:49.374]  And this is where- They don't tend to repeat.
[00:44:49.454 --> 00:44:51.515]  I mean, history repeats and rhymes.
[00:44:51.855 --> 00:44:54.237]  It happens a little different, but it matches basically the tempo.
[00:44:55.537 --> 00:44:55.978]  It does.
[00:44:56.458 --> 00:45:10.283]  And so when we see this price pullback, when the fundamentals of the markets did not change, well then, you know, because unsustainable debt, inflationary pressures, political chaos, geopolitical conflict, we've got communists running on the Democrat side.
[00:45:10.563 --> 00:45:13.364]  I mean, this is uncertainty like nothing we've ever seen.
[00:45:13.904 --> 00:45:15.785]  And so those fundamentals didn't change.
[00:45:15.905 --> 00:45:20.166]  So therefore, the rationale of why and how we invest doesn't change either.
[00:45:20.546 --> 00:45:20.686]  Right.
[00:45:20.706 --> 00:45:22.347]  So it's a buying opportunity.
[00:45:23.527 --> 00:45:30.270]  So here's where the fundamentals, Alex, are so strong in an ugly way.
[00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:33.292]  If we go down to the U.S.
[00:45:33.332 --> 00:45:36.593]  economy section of the documents I sent you.
[00:45:37.414 --> 00:45:38.834]  So where is the U.S.
[00:45:38.914 --> 00:45:39.074]  now?
[00:45:39.214 --> 00:45:42.576]  How are we fighting inflation as a nation, as people?
[00:45:42.996 --> 00:45:44.317]  We're doing it with debt.
[00:45:46.058 --> 00:45:57.746]  Because of Bidenomics and the massive inflationary pressures in the high taxation environment, we are fighting inflation the only way that we know how as people, and that's with debt.
[00:45:58.106 --> 00:46:00.668]  So look at these numbers.
[00:46:01.068 --> 00:46:05.371]  $17.8 trillion in household debt, $12.5 trillion in mortgages.
[00:46:05.491 --> 00:46:07.453]  These are all records, by the way, right?
[00:46:08.493 --> 00:46:17.077]  $1.6 trillion in auto loans, nearly $1.6 trillion in student loans, $1.1 trillion in credit card debt.
[00:46:17.558 --> 00:46:20.899]  Household debt's up 53% over the last 10 years.
[00:46:21.439 --> 00:46:24.941]  Credit card debt is up 50% since 2020.
[00:46:25.581 --> 00:46:29.383]  See, delinquency on all these things, and people can't afford it.
[00:46:29.463 --> 00:46:33.545]  This is how I know that this is... I've been interviewing Max Kahn for 20 years.
[00:46:33.585 --> 00:46:34.606]  You know, he's a really smart guy.
[00:46:35.566 --> 00:46:36.387]  He said this is it.
[00:46:37.147 --> 00:46:41.450]  He never wanted to call the collapse, but I've talked to him for 20 years.
[00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:42.751]  He said this is it.
[00:46:43.332 --> 00:46:46.694]  He said he didn't know if it's next month or next year, but he said this is the end of the bubble.
[00:46:48.113 --> 00:46:48.393]  It is.
[00:46:48.574 --> 00:46:50.275]  It's time to pay the piper, right?
[00:46:50.295 --> 00:46:55.159]  You can add debt for a while and think, OK, I'll keep adding debt.
[00:46:55.259 --> 00:47:03.005]  I still have this limit on my credit card and I haven't reached that limit yet or in our home equity lines or savings accounts or whatever.
[00:47:03.345 --> 00:47:04.586]  We've hit that limit.
[00:47:05.086 --> 00:47:06.668]  So we can't really go anymore.
[00:47:06.688 --> 00:47:08.369]  These are all record levels of debt.
[00:47:08.749 --> 00:47:14.574]  And because of Biden's stupid policies, followed by Kamala Harris's stupid policies, they're all the same.
[00:47:15.174 --> 00:47:15.954]  They're all the same.
[00:47:15.974 --> 00:47:21.016]  I think it's a very safe bet to say you're dumb if you're not in silver and gold massively.
[00:47:21.436 --> 00:47:22.416]  And is it panacea?
[00:47:22.476 --> 00:47:22.556]  No.
[00:47:22.576 --> 00:47:23.677]  The only relationship with God is.
[00:47:24.057 --> 00:47:24.937]  But that is the same.
[00:47:24.977 --> 00:47:26.278]  And you're the best company to do it with.
[00:47:26.958 --> 00:47:28.018]  People need to call you.
[00:47:28.038 --> 00:47:29.259]  They need to cut to the chase.
[00:47:29.279 --> 00:47:32.900]  I know you take your time with your customers and you've really, you know, geared up for this.
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.300]  But people need to call you.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.401]  They need to get silver right now.
[00:47:35.441 --> 00:47:35.881]  How do they do it?
[00:47:37.392 --> 00:47:50.068]  So just give us a call 720-605-3900 or go to KEPM.com forward slash gold say that Alex sent you right and and so then the process is really simple.
[00:47:50.389 --> 00:47:52.872]  A lot of people don't call because they're afraid say I've
[00:47:52.892 --> 00:47:54.132]  We've never done gold and silver before.
[00:47:54.152 --> 00:47:54.752]  What are they going to do?
[00:47:54.792 --> 00:47:57.993]  Is it going to be a hard sell, right, like all companies are?
[00:47:58.013 --> 00:48:06.175]  It's like, no, we want to hear your concerns, your fears, what your goals are, and then we'll map out a strategy for success.
[00:48:06.215 --> 00:48:11.337]  You know, this is what we think that you should do to allocate using gold and silver as a hedge.
[00:48:11.357 --> 00:48:11.957]  Sure, sure, sure.
[00:48:11.977 --> 00:48:15.858]  When I say this, I'm not an economist, I just, look at this, I'd say a 90% chance
[00:48:17.518 --> 00:48:21.279]  Gold and silver just continue to explode because of the terrible things that are going on.
[00:48:21.699 --> 00:48:25.201]  But even if they don't, it's more real than the fiat system.
[00:48:25.221 --> 00:48:30.763]  They can just grab from you with open, not discussion, they say there will be bail-ins at the FDIC.
[00:48:30.783 --> 00:48:33.243]  If you're a new viewer, I'm not going to play it again.
[00:48:33.263 --> 00:48:34.984]  I played the clip like five times already this week.
[00:48:35.344 --> 00:48:37.325]  But I mean, they're saying there will be bail-ins.
[00:48:37.705 --> 00:48:39.726]  Folks, you want to just trust these people with your money?
[00:48:40.586 --> 00:48:45.210]  People are insane if they have liquid assets to not be 30% in silver right now.
[00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:48.112]  I mean, if I had extra assets, that's what I would be doing right now.
[00:48:49.493 --> 00:48:59.422]  Yeah, because Alex, now mainstream media is starting to talk about what you and I have been talking about for the last nine months, and that is recession is coming.
[00:48:59.862 --> 00:49:05.126]  Goldman Sachs even said, okay, the probability of a recession before the end of the year went from 25% to 35%.
[00:49:07.408 --> 00:49:13.072]  You talked about this earlier this week, about bird flu and some kind of swine flu and all this other garbage.
[00:49:13.232 --> 00:49:16.254]  A pandemic is coming as well, right?
[00:49:16.274 --> 00:49:17.034]  Yeah, monkeypox.
[00:49:17.074 --> 00:49:17.935]  It's like, what?
[00:49:18.315 --> 00:49:20.476]  I mean, they're making up all these things.
[00:49:20.496 --> 00:49:25.659]  The Democrats are openly on TV saying, occupy America with the UN and NATO.
[00:49:26.059 --> 00:49:28.561]  Biden said, we won't let Trump take over.
[00:49:28.601 --> 00:49:29.502]  It won't be peaceful.
[00:49:29.802 --> 00:49:31.383]  I mean, look, look.
[00:49:33.064 --> 00:49:34.264]  I'm just telling you like it is, folks.
[00:49:34.304 --> 00:49:35.005]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:49:37.253 --> 00:49:37.513]  It is.
[00:49:37.874 --> 00:49:47.081]  And the biggest, I mean, so near the bottom, the second to the last article that I sent you, because I know we're running out of time, the rot in commercial real estate.
[00:49:47.402 --> 00:49:49.023]  We think that it's bad now.
[00:49:49.663 --> 00:49:55.128]  Wait until this bubble bursts, which is going to be sometime over the next 24 months.
[00:49:55.168 --> 00:49:56.169]  It's already starting.
[00:49:56.609 --> 00:49:58.611]  Commercial real estate in Denver, like
[00:49:59.031 --> 00:50:00.552]  Our office, that we own here.
[00:50:00.953 --> 00:50:05.396]  I talked to a realtor last week, just like, what's our office worth?
[00:50:05.417 --> 00:50:08.319]  It's like, it's down 50%, right?
[00:50:08.379 --> 00:50:08.819]  It's down 50%.
[00:50:08.959 --> 00:50:10.741]  Miami is down 25%.
[00:50:11.682 --> 00:50:12.863]  That's the hottest real estate in the country.
[00:50:13.769 --> 00:50:19.030]  Yeah, and so this commercial real estate sector is going to devastate banks.
[00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:26.172]  So UBS basically had this building, and it's just a quick little story, has this building in Manhattan, right?
[00:50:26.272 --> 00:50:29.092]  So they bought it- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:50:29.112 --> 00:50:30.373]  We're getting Tommy Robinson on.
[00:50:30.793 --> 00:50:31.493]  We got to go to break.
[00:50:31.533 --> 00:50:33.333]  Do five more minutes on this and explain this.
[00:50:33.373 --> 00:50:36.494]  But folks, again, the banks are mainly invested in real estate.
[00:50:37.836 --> 00:50:38.736]  And stocks and bonds.
[00:50:38.796 --> 00:50:40.517]  Those go down, real estate goes down.
[00:50:41.377 --> 00:50:42.978]  You've already got bank failure starting.
[00:50:43.438 --> 00:50:45.279]  All the experts agree that's the next big deal.
[00:50:45.699 --> 00:50:48.260]  It's a guarantee a bunch of banks are going to fail.
[00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:52.262]  As you predicted six months ago, you said August or September, we're here.
[00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:53.262]  So how long?
[00:50:53.502 --> 00:50:55.163]  Quick answer and we'll go to break, come back.
[00:50:56.284 --> 00:51:06.848]  You're not God, we know that, but dead reckoning as an economist, as a father, as a Christian, as a patriot, how soon until this becomes super evident and the banks start failing everywhere?
[00:51:08.269 --> 00:51:09.170]  Before the election.
[00:51:11.532 --> 00:51:20.819]  I think this all comes down before the election because it is the pulse that will hopefully get the Democrats, right, is what they want, is people to say, please fix it.
[00:51:20.939 --> 00:51:22.640]  We will give you whatever you want.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:23.801]  You've got to fix this thing.
[00:51:23.861 --> 00:51:25.543]  I think it happens before the election.
[00:51:27.064 --> 00:51:27.744]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:27.764 --> 00:51:28.325]  Stay with us.
[00:51:28.665 --> 00:51:29.606]  Tommy Robinson coming up.
[00:51:40.615 --> 00:51:53.419]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements, because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[00:51:53.859 --> 00:51:56.060]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:02.302]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[00:52:03.385 --> 00:52:11.947]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[00:52:12.287 --> 00:52:14.127]  We had five companies making product for us.
[00:52:14.747 --> 00:52:19.268]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're in full wars.
[00:52:19.988 --> 00:52:25.629]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[00:52:25.649 --> 00:52:28.549]  I'm not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:30.870]  And they said, listen, you know
[00:52:32.096 --> 00:52:48.099]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:55.141]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[00:52:56.175 --> 00:52:56.595]  I don't know.
[00:53:08.149 --> 00:53:16.254]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we were even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[00:53:16.334 --> 00:53:22.958]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[00:53:23.118 --> 00:53:25.600]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:27.701]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[00:53:27.901 --> 00:53:37.674]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[00:53:38.295 --> 00:53:40.698]  So, that's what Impul Wars MD is.
[00:53:40.759 --> 00:53:41.820]  Take Turmeric 95.
[00:53:43.482 --> 00:53:50.187]  Turmeric 95 isn't called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[00:53:50.307 --> 00:53:55.970]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[00:53:56.071 --> 00:54:04.596]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTore.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[00:54:04.656 --> 00:54:06.738]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[00:54:06.978 --> 00:54:07.078]  And
[00:54:08.348 --> 00:54:21.631]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[00:54:22.132 --> 00:54:26.513]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[00:54:26.573 --> 00:54:31.214]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[00:54:31.534 --> 00:54:34.976]  At InfoWarsStore.com from InfoWarsMD.
[00:54:35.116 --> 00:54:37.457]  So, I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[00:54:37.577 --> 00:54:38.177]  It's amazing.
[00:54:38.297 --> 00:54:39.238]  It's super high quality.
[00:54:39.298 --> 00:54:41.159]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[00:54:41.279 --> 00:54:41.959]  Nitric Boost.
[00:54:42.119 --> 00:54:42.839]  Good night's sleep.
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:44.600]  Joint Relief Max is amazing.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:45.201]  Nerve Renew.
[00:54:45.221 --> 00:54:45.981]  Prostate Support.
[00:54:46.041 --> 00:54:47.061]  Probiotic Formula.
[00:54:47.182 --> 00:54:48.702]  CBD Full Spectrum.
[00:54:48.982 --> 00:54:50.083]  25 milligram gummies.
[00:54:50.203 --> 00:54:51.384]  CBD Full Spectrum.
[00:54:51.604 --> 00:54:52.404]  10 milligram gummies.
[00:54:52.444 --> 00:54:53.004]  Works great.
[00:54:53.044 --> 00:54:54.045]  Turmeric 95.
[00:54:54.205 --> 00:54:55.345]  Libido RX.
[00:54:55.505 --> 00:54:56.146]  Better Mood.
[00:54:56.306 --> 00:54:59.707]  Mushroom Max for mental clarity and your immune system.
[00:54:59.828 --> 00:55:00.788]  Superfood Greens.
[00:55:00.888 --> 00:55:01.208]  Thank you.
[00:55:30.504 --> 00:55:34.029]  All right, Tommy Robinson's getting connected from an undisclosed location in Europe.
[00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:36.192]  England's going full tyranny.
[00:55:36.432 --> 00:55:36.993]  It is on.
[00:55:37.033 --> 00:55:38.154]  The tyrants are desperate.
[00:55:38.475 --> 00:55:39.797]  He's joining us in five minutes.
[00:55:40.437 --> 00:55:42.480]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, we got four minutes to break here.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.883]  You've got the floor to finish up that point about the
[00:55:45.424 --> 00:55:46.225]  We're good to go.
[00:56:07.625 --> 00:56:08.906]  Yeah, it's going down.
[00:56:08.946 --> 00:56:12.369]  And so, Alex, you and I have talked a ton about banks.
[00:56:12.649 --> 00:56:22.078]  The next bank run, the next round of bank failures, commercial real estate, I believe, is going to be the linchpin, the spark that causes all of that.
[00:56:22.138 --> 00:56:23.659]  So, quick little story.
[00:56:23.679 --> 00:56:27.863]  UBS, you know, this building in New York, paid $332 million for it, invested $76 million in renovations for a total of $408 million.
[00:56:34.168 --> 00:56:34.549]  You know what?
[00:56:34.609 --> 00:56:37.011]  The vacancy rate was ridiculously low, 43%.
[00:56:38.472 --> 00:56:39.553]  So they had to sell it.
[00:56:40.074 --> 00:56:41.856]  What did they sell this building for?
[00:56:41.876 --> 00:56:45.539]  $8.5 million.
[00:56:45.559 --> 00:56:47.060]  $393 million loss.
[00:56:47.501 --> 00:56:52.345]  Now, on books, on paper, they had accelerated depreciation.
[00:56:52.406 --> 00:56:53.467]  It didn't look that bad.
[00:56:53.747 --> 00:56:55.849]  But you can never take accounting tricks
[00:56:56.209 --> 00:56:59.133]  To account for actual realized losses.
[00:56:59.453 --> 00:57:00.414]  That's what that was.
[00:57:00.775 --> 00:57:08.204]  So the reason I bring that up is this is going to come across the board over the next 24 months.
[00:57:08.224 --> 00:57:13.531]  $1.2 trillion of commercial real estate debt in the United States will mature.
[00:57:14.071 --> 00:57:26.459]  So, what are these people, these companies, going to do when they have low vacancy rates, they can't afford the buildings, and interest rates have tripled or more from where they were, you know, when they got these things, and now they're maturing.
[00:57:26.779 --> 00:57:28.420]  They're not going to be able to refinance them.
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:29.661]  They can't afford them.
[00:57:30.161 --> 00:57:34.504]  All of this toxic debt is going to be handed back to the banks.
[00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:36.345]  This doesn't happen in 24 months.
[00:57:36.425 --> 00:57:36.786]  In 24 months.
[00:57:37.346 --> 00:57:38.206]  Over the next 24 months.
[00:57:40.808 --> 00:57:42.288]  All of these things are unraveling.
[00:57:42.708 --> 00:57:46.549]  $1.2 trillion of commercial real estate.
[00:57:46.729 --> 00:57:51.430]  I believe that's the spark that's gonna cause banks to start to fail.
[00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:54.971]  And when the first one happens, here's the danger.
[00:57:55.351 --> 00:57:57.952]  It's gonna be like that movie, It's a Wonderful Life, right?
[00:57:57.992 --> 00:58:03.393]  Where people are going into the bank, they can't get their money, they're not gonna know what to do, a run on the bank ensues.
[00:58:03.833 --> 00:58:06.834]  And so when you've got that big of a deal, $1.2 trillion,
[00:58:09.174 --> 00:58:10.974]  This is going to cause banks to fail, Alex.
[00:58:10.994 --> 00:58:12.435]  So what then do we do?
[00:58:12.875 --> 00:58:15.976]  This is why you and I shout it from the rooftops.
[00:58:16.556 --> 00:58:17.816]  Get to safe ground.
[00:58:18.156 --> 00:58:19.696]  Get to something that's tangible.
[00:58:20.036 --> 00:58:21.477]  Get to something that's real.
[00:58:22.097 --> 00:58:29.378]  Five years ago, I would have said, yeah, having money on the bank, sitting on the sidelines, sitting in cash is a safe thing to do if you think markets are coming down.
[00:58:29.799 --> 00:58:31.759]  Look, I can't say that anymore.
[00:58:32.259 --> 00:58:36.020]  Banks are undercapitalized in very dangerous territory.
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.862]  And it's the end of the line, right?
[00:58:39.982 --> 00:58:41.442]  The rope is gone.
[00:58:41.903 --> 00:58:47.165]  And we're at that tipping point, Alex, where we're seeing global monetary change.
[00:58:47.405 --> 00:58:49.146]  We're seeing what's happening in Japan.
[00:58:49.466 --> 00:58:51.687]  We're seeing the undercapitalization of banks.
[00:58:51.987 --> 00:58:55.469]  We're seeing all of these technical charts where history repeats itself.
[00:58:56.009 --> 00:58:56.609]  Overbought.
[00:58:56.850 --> 00:58:57.970]  Gonna come crashing down.
[00:58:58.090 --> 00:58:59.391]  Get to safe ground.
[00:59:00.191 --> 00:59:03.253]  Literally, get to safe ground, tangible assets.
[00:59:03.793 --> 00:59:04.574]  When the U.S.
[00:59:04.654 --> 00:59:16.680]  dollar has lost literally 99% of its value since the Federal Reserve started, it's lost over 80% of its value since the petrodollar in the early 1970s.
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:24.464]  Just having gold and silver as a safe haven, almost insurance policy against a collapsing currency.
[00:59:24.504 --> 00:59:26.786]  Oh, it's 100% have it as a hedge and probably
[00:59:27.446 --> 00:59:33.388]  If I was without the enemy trying to take all our wealth away, I would be 100% in right now on silver, as you said.
[00:59:33.848 --> 00:59:35.489]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:59:35.509 --> 00:59:36.909]  You get the best deals.
[00:59:37.089 --> 00:59:37.929]  It supports the show.
[00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:39.730]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:40.590]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:40.930]  720-605-3900.
[00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.371]  They make 8%.
[00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:42.531]  You can sell it back for nothing.
[00:59:46.346 --> 00:59:50.228]  And that goes into their marketing, their crew, everybody, their sponsorship, everything.
[00:59:50.889 --> 00:59:55.832]  They made the decision 25 years ago to have very small margins, but to have the biggest audience, and they've done it.
[00:59:55.932 --> 01:00:02.876]  The place to go is under Kirk Elliott at kpm.com forward slash Gold or 720-605-2900.
[01:00:02.916 --> 01:00:04.357]  That's 720-605-3900.
[01:00:04.377 --> 01:00:07.039]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, thank you so much.
[01:00:07.079 --> 01:00:07.539]  God bless you.
[01:00:07.559 --> 01:00:08.299]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:09.540]  God bless.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.000]  See you, Alex.
[01:00:10.581 --> 01:00:12.142]  Call him right now, folks, or you're stupid.
[01:00:14.434 --> 01:00:18.757]  Welcome to hour number two of this incredible Thursday, August 8, 2024 transmission.
[01:00:19.357 --> 01:00:23.960]  Laura Logan, an incredible individual, will be in studio with us coming up in 25 minutes.
[01:00:24.841 --> 01:00:39.170]  But let me tell you, the best part of my job is I get to know Donald Trump, I get to know Tucker Carlson, I get to know Elon Musk, I get to know Joe Rogan, I get to know Russell Brand, I get to know all of you black, white, Hispanic, old, young that love freedom.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:51.562]  And I get to know Tommy Robinson, who 15 years ago was running a tanning salon and saw members of his family kidnapped and raped by Islamists and the grooming gangs that all came out the government was defending.
[01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:58.984]  And he's always called for peace and he founded the English Defense League like 14 years ago and it was led by Sikhs and everybody.
[01:00:59.004 --> 01:01:00.744]  He wasn't against any of the other outsiders.
[01:01:00.764 --> 01:01:01.704]  They were all assimilating.
[01:01:01.944 --> 01:01:02.865]  They were all great people.
[01:01:03.505 --> 01:01:04.225]  He wasn't racist.
[01:01:05.523 --> 01:01:06.683]  The Indians, all of them.
[01:01:07.143 --> 01:01:08.404]  People from Jamaica, you name it.
[01:01:09.044 --> 01:01:12.185]  But the Islamists, no, they were there to take over.
[01:01:12.965 --> 01:01:14.785]  And so he's been calling for peace for years.
[01:01:14.825 --> 01:01:16.226]  He's been put in prison for nothing.
[01:01:16.666 --> 01:01:17.366]  Solitary confinement.
[01:01:17.386 --> 01:01:22.988]  And now Piers Morgan and all the corporate media and the BBC have said he's behind the riots in England.
[01:01:23.008 --> 01:01:25.588]  They covered up the Islamic riots that were 95% of the violence.
[01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:31.630]  We have hours of horrible footage of just random white people having their brains beat out, stabbed, you name it.
[01:01:32.628 --> 01:01:34.269]  And now the Prime Minister's called for his arrest.
[01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:35.831]  They're saying they're going to arrest him.
[01:01:35.851 --> 01:01:37.852]  They have members of Parliament saying they're going to arrest him.
[01:01:39.373 --> 01:01:40.855]  He already had a vacation months ago.
[01:01:41.175 --> 01:01:42.376]  They're saying he ran to Europe.
[01:01:42.416 --> 01:01:42.796]  He didn't.
[01:01:43.216 --> 01:01:53.304]  But I've told him, and I think he agrees, he needs to stay in Europe now because he's reaching, as the BBC reported with anger, 30 million people a day, conservatively, just on his ex-account, right now.
[01:01:53.424 --> 01:01:55.106]  So, this is backfiring.
[01:01:55.146 --> 01:01:56.927]  The film, 40 million views now.
[01:01:56.967 --> 01:01:57.728]  They tried to suppress.
[01:01:58.108 --> 01:01:58.809]  They just released.
[01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:10.598]  So this is one hell of a time to be alive and we have the head of the National Prosecution, that's the equivalent of their FBI prosecutor, saying if you retweet or show the Islamic violence, we'll put you in prison.
[01:02:11.199 --> 01:02:12.160]  The law doesn't even say that.
[01:02:13.234 --> 01:02:16.356]  So they're in full panic mode with their Islamic invasion.
[01:02:16.856 --> 01:02:18.397]  The House of Lords is talking about it.
[01:02:18.477 --> 01:02:19.178]  Parliament is.
[01:02:19.678 --> 01:02:20.579]  It's an incredible time.
[01:02:20.599 --> 01:02:26.402]  But I wanted to get Tommy Robinson to give us an update on what's happening and that monster.
[01:02:27.023 --> 01:02:31.686]  Piers Morgan saying, and now he's even blaming Andrew Tate, who's a Muslim.
[01:02:32.466 --> 01:02:33.846]  And who's been calling for nothing but peace.
[01:02:34.207 --> 01:02:36.027]  He had Andrew Tate on and said, do you want to apologize?
[01:02:36.047 --> 01:02:37.187]  Do you want to say you're against violence?
[01:02:37.488 --> 01:02:39.788]  Andrew Tate said, show me where I call for violence.
[01:02:40.068 --> 01:02:43.269]  This is like they sit there and they accuse you.
[01:02:43.689 --> 01:02:45.670]  They're the ones that brought in all these people.
[01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:51.312]  And then he accuses a Muslim who lives in another country just because he's against
[01:02:52.664 --> 01:02:54.967]  The censorship or the control that he's violent.
[01:02:55.707 --> 01:02:58.049]  I think Andrew Tate should sue him for defamation.
[01:02:58.290 --> 01:03:01.313]  The defamation laws are very strong in England.
[01:03:01.633 --> 01:03:02.774]  Piers Morgan is disgusting.
[01:03:03.014 --> 01:03:03.575]  I'm ranting.
[01:03:03.635 --> 01:03:05.216]  Tommy, we've got limited time.
[01:03:05.256 --> 01:03:06.177]  We appreciate you.
[01:03:06.838 --> 01:03:07.739]  Go ahead, you've got the floor.
[01:03:09.701 --> 01:03:16.267]  Piers Morgan sat on that TV show and said that I have incited violence and destruction of mosques.
[01:03:17.361 --> 01:03:18.602]  That's just a blatant lie.
[01:03:18.782 --> 01:03:19.583]  It's just a total lie.
[01:03:19.883 --> 01:03:21.004]  I'm sitting here watching.
[01:03:21.285 --> 01:03:25.288]  Now it's played out, even like yesterday, our government went full mode.
[01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:27.910]  NHS, unions, they were lit.
[01:03:28.111 --> 01:03:33.015]  The whole country got told there was a hundred far-right racist riots happening.
[01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:33.876]  There was none.
[01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:35.217]  There was none planned.
[01:03:35.617 --> 01:03:36.398]  It was all a hoax.
[01:03:36.838 --> 01:03:39.000]  That was a hoax to get the mobilisation.
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:44.265]  So now the front page of our papers is, the far-right was stopped by the communities.
[01:03:44.825 --> 01:03:46.967]  There was no planned demonstrations.
[01:03:46.987 --> 01:03:47.667]  You made it all up.
[01:03:48.187 --> 01:03:49.248]  You made all of it up.
[01:03:49.628 --> 01:03:54.732]  And you can see now the way it's orchestrated and the entire attack, the attack against me.
[01:03:54.992 --> 01:04:00.536]  I'm sitting here, literally, my media, my police, my government have declared war on me.
[01:04:00.936 --> 01:04:01.836]  I've done nothing wrong.
[01:04:02.937 --> 01:04:06.920]  The actual evidence of what I say is calling for calm, calling for peace.
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:09.602]  And now they're saying you were going to lead
[01:04:10.282 --> 01:04:23.689]  All over the news, I'm showing the articles, 100 violent marches, you never called for those, you had a peaceful demonstration with 100,000 people before they stabbed the three girls to death, and then they blame you and now claim victory that they stopped you from burning down England.
[01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:26.971]  And there were no demonstrations planned!
[01:04:27.271 --> 01:04:27.771]  There was none!
[01:04:28.211 --> 01:04:31.933]  There was one demonstration last night in Aldershot, and it was totally peaceful.
[01:04:32.033 --> 01:04:39.117]  But there were, Mike, you posted it on your ex, hundreds of violent attacks against white people by the, mainly, Pakistanis.
[01:04:40.287 --> 01:04:41.487]  They called it last night.
[01:04:41.667 --> 01:04:43.388]  The Muslims rioted last night in Croydon.
[01:04:43.408 --> 01:04:45.168]  You wouldn't know that because it's not in any of the media.
[01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:46.729]  They don't call it a riot.
[01:04:47.069 --> 01:04:48.609]  They call it anti-social behaviour.
[01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:52.690]  We won't see pictures of them all over the news getting arrested and getting their doors kicked off.
[01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:57.671]  We've got videos of police cutting open doors, ramming through them.
[01:04:58.111 --> 01:05:00.572]  One man just got sentenced today, an English man.
[01:05:00.952 --> 01:05:03.252]  He's near enough a pensioner, 59 years old.
[01:05:03.613 --> 01:05:08.554]  He just got 26 months in jail for shouting aggressively at police.
[01:05:08.974 --> 01:05:09.614]  I kid you not.
[01:05:10.034 --> 01:05:11.535]  Shouting!
[01:05:11.775 --> 01:05:13.775]  26 months for shouting at police.
[01:05:14.196 --> 01:05:15.316]  I'll ask the question again.
[01:05:15.816 --> 01:05:19.017]  Where was the equivalent for the Romanians and Muslims that rioted?
[01:05:19.338 --> 01:05:21.979]  Where are the equivalent raids like this?
[01:05:22.279 --> 01:05:24.219]  How come we've not seen all their pictures in the news?
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.760]  Why haven't we been given their names?
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.561]  How come they're not in prison within a week?
[01:05:27.861 --> 01:05:32.923]  What we saw yesterday, Alex, was a Labour, our government, Kia Sama, two-tier Kia,
[01:05:34.083 --> 01:05:40.226]  One of his councillors stood on the streets and said, we need to slit all of the far right's throats.
[01:05:40.326 --> 01:05:41.846]  And by the way, we're going to pull that clip up.
[01:05:41.906 --> 01:05:42.947]  It's his name is Jones.
[01:05:42.987 --> 01:05:44.007]  I'm actually saying my name now.
[01:05:44.447 --> 01:05:49.609]  His name is Jones, a council, city council member, saying kill and murder and slit the throats.
[01:05:49.889 --> 01:05:52.891]  And they're just randomly running into pubs and beating up white people.
[01:05:52.911 --> 01:05:53.491]  We have the videos.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.360]  And they're all cheering.
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:56.921]  They're all cheering as he's doing it.
[01:05:57.341 --> 01:05:58.581]  And this is the Labour government.
[01:05:58.741 --> 01:06:02.022]  We actually, what people need to understand is, we live under communism.
[01:06:02.282 --> 01:06:03.402]  People just don't realise it yet.
[01:06:03.702 --> 01:06:04.663]  We're already there.
[01:06:04.943 --> 01:06:06.423]  We're not heading towards communism.
[01:06:06.743 --> 01:06:07.303]  We're there.
[01:06:07.904 --> 01:06:08.324]  Already.
[01:06:08.624 --> 01:06:11.265]  We've got people getting 26 months for shouting at the police.
[01:06:11.585 --> 01:06:14.986]  We've got a total two-tier judiciary, two-tier policing system.
[01:06:15.186 --> 01:06:16.026]  I'll let you play his voice.
[01:06:17.266 --> 01:06:18.126]  He calls for the murder.
[01:06:18.967 --> 01:06:20.187]  He calls for the murder of people.
[01:06:22.591 --> 01:06:25.114]  Since you mention it, let's play the clip with audio.
[01:06:25.134 --> 01:06:25.454]  Here it is.
[01:06:45.106 --> 01:06:52.153]  So Tommy, if you said, go slit brown people's throats, you're not even against.
[01:07:02.623 --> 01:07:04.364]  You would be thrown in prison for life.
[01:07:04.684 --> 01:07:10.849]  Here's a member of a major city council saying, go out and kill the English Defense League that hasn't existed in 10 years.
[01:07:10.909 --> 01:07:11.789]  It was multiracial.
[01:07:12.049 --> 01:07:13.130]  They're literally running around.
[01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:15.592]  I have hundreds, I can't even watch them all.
[01:07:16.012 --> 01:07:21.736]  I have like dozens on my list here of them beating, they'll just find a white person and beat their brains out.
[01:07:22.496 --> 01:07:30.500]  And then now the head of the federal prosecution says, if you show that, we're going to put you in jail, including if you're a foreigner, we're going to extradite you.
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:31.080]  Well, guess what?
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:31.740]  We're going to show it.
[01:07:32.161 --> 01:07:32.621]  Go ahead, Tommy.
[01:07:33.723 --> 01:07:34.424]  Alex, you know what?
[01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:35.945]  You know the reason why they're hating this?
[01:07:36.185 --> 01:07:38.587]  The reason why they're hating this is because you see these videos you're showing?
[01:07:38.847 --> 01:07:40.648]  They're the videos I'm showing on my X account.
[01:07:40.968 --> 01:07:41.949]  No one would see these.
[01:07:42.389 --> 01:07:43.690]  They have had total control.
[01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:47.393]  Until Elon Musk took over X, they had total control over what the public see.
[01:07:47.813 --> 01:07:48.574]  I was censored.
[01:07:48.874 --> 01:07:51.396]  Anyone like us was censored on all social medias.
[01:07:51.596 --> 01:07:54.598]  If you go onto TikTok now and search Tommy Robinson, there's no videos.
[01:07:54.838 --> 01:07:56.980]  You're not allowed to mention my name on Facebook or Instagram.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.763]  They have total control over what the public see.
[01:07:59.983 --> 01:08:04.187]  They don't like the fact, you know you said earlier it was 30 million people a day, it's 50 million a day.
[01:08:04.567 --> 01:08:15.137]  They don't like that when they're pumping this narrative of this fake organisation called the English Defence League, of these fake demonstrations, they've got someone who's uncontrollable as a journalist saying actually you're lying.
[01:08:15.577 --> 01:08:17.559]  And actually here's what's happening on the streets,
[01:08:18.239 --> 01:08:21.620]  As they chase this boy, they shout in white boy, white boy.
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:22.780]  They're racially beating him.
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:24.441]  That man there is what he's wearing from work.
[01:08:24.641 --> 01:08:25.681]  He's in his work clothes.
[01:08:26.021 --> 01:08:27.002]  He's what he's wearing from work.
[01:08:27.222 --> 01:08:28.702]  This doesn't even make our news.
[01:08:28.962 --> 01:08:30.623]  None of these attacks have made our news.
[01:08:30.863 --> 01:08:33.603]  They're literally walking down the streets with swords, hammers.
[01:08:34.003 --> 01:08:39.125]  Luckily, we had a police officer today who got interviewed on Talk TV, who said that the police were told
[01:08:40.052 --> 01:08:46.117]  And now the head of the prosecution says he wants to put you in jail, but anybody that shows the Islamic violence
[01:09:10.452 --> 01:09:12.156]  If you share the videos, they want to bring in new laws.
[01:09:17.022 --> 01:09:18.063]  Because they can't control it.
[01:09:18.383 --> 01:09:19.363]  So the people are seeing it.
[01:09:19.684 --> 01:09:20.564]  The public are awake.
[01:09:20.644 --> 01:09:21.645]  They're seeing what's happening.
[01:09:21.845 --> 01:09:24.927]  This is an innocent pub full of families playing karaoke.
[01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:30.690]  And because they're white, these mobs of Muslims who are armed with weapons, who police let them walk down there.
[01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:33.412]  They didn't kettle them, didn't get their dogs out, didn't get their horses.
[01:09:33.712 --> 01:09:38.154]  There is a total two... And they're gaslighting us on TV, saying there's no two-tier policing.
[01:09:38.415 --> 01:09:39.655]  There's not just two-tier policing.
[01:09:39.815 --> 01:09:40.756]  There's two-tier funding.
[01:09:40.916 --> 01:09:42.277]  There's two-tier judiciary.
[01:09:42.477 --> 01:09:43.898]  There's two-tier everything.
[01:09:44.198 --> 01:09:45.619]  Now, the worrying thing for the public
[01:09:46.119 --> 01:09:48.841]  The Muslim community make up 6% of the country.
[01:09:49.261 --> 01:09:51.123]  What do you think it's going to be like when they're 20%?
[01:09:52.524 --> 01:09:54.285]  Already we're left to fend for ourselves.
[01:09:54.425 --> 01:09:56.327]  Already the police aren't enforcing the law.
[01:09:56.587 --> 01:09:57.287]  Already now.
[01:09:57.688 --> 01:09:58.828]  They can't enforce the law.
[01:09:59.069 --> 01:10:07.575]  They know that with those Muslim mobs full of weapons, they've arrested one today who's done a video with a machine gun saying he's going to come and shoot the EDL and he names me.
[01:10:08.135 --> 01:10:11.116]  Now what they've done, Alex, this has nothing to do with me.
[01:10:11.816 --> 01:10:15.318]  This holiday that I was on was pre-planned 18 months ago.
[01:10:15.338 --> 01:10:16.598]  I'm going to put the booking form up.
[01:10:16.878 --> 01:10:18.399]  I booked it 18 months ago.
[01:10:18.679 --> 01:10:20.680]  They say I fled the country after the riots.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:22.440]  I'd left the country before any riots.
[01:10:22.821 --> 01:10:24.101]  I wasn't involved in any riots.
[01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:29.283]  They've landed this on my lap to justify the fact that they want to lock me up for a long time.
[01:10:29.483 --> 01:10:36.426]  They want the public, and my mate rang me today and said he's had people going up to him saying, I can't believe your mate Tommy's getting everyone to burn the country.
[01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:38.161]  What?
[01:10:38.722 --> 01:10:38.942]  How?
[01:10:39.102 --> 01:10:41.363]  How can your government and your media... So let's play the clip.
[01:10:41.383 --> 01:10:41.823]  Let's play it.
[01:10:41.883 --> 01:10:43.124]  And Piers Morgan's given the script.
[01:10:43.164 --> 01:10:43.704]  He follows it.
[01:10:44.105 --> 01:10:56.012]  So here is Stephen Parkinson, who is the federal prosecutor, saying if you show the videos of the Muslims attacking people, you are the terrorist for showing what they did because they know England's waking up.
[01:10:56.352 --> 01:11:00.654]  It's about to shut down the millions of illegals they're bringing in every few years.
[01:11:00.734 --> 01:11:01.195]  Here's the clip.
[01:11:02.443 --> 01:11:16.071]  The offence of incitement to racial hatred involves publishing or distributing material which is insulting or abusive, which is intended to or likely to start racial hatred.
[01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:21.034]  So if you retweet that, then you're republishing that, and then potentially you're committing that offence.
[01:11:21.654 --> 01:11:25.878]  And we do have dedicated police officers who are scouring social media.
[01:11:26.439 --> 01:11:33.065]  Their job is to look for this material and then follow up with identification arrests and so forth.
[01:11:33.565 --> 01:11:35.247]  So it's really, really serious.
[01:11:35.347 --> 01:11:39.310]  People might think they're not doing anything harmful.
[01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.911]  They are.
[01:11:40.592 --> 01:11:42.734]  And the consequences will be visited upon them.
[01:11:44.574 --> 01:11:54.278]  And now we learn, Tommy, that the prosecutor that freed and protected Jimmy Savelle for his mass rape of children was your current Prime Minister.
[01:11:54.638 --> 01:11:55.978]  I mean, these are some nasty people.
[01:11:56.959 --> 01:11:58.319]  Yes, he's our Prime Minister.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:59.200]  He let him off.
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:00.220]  He covered for him.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.841]  He said there was insufficient evidence.
[01:12:02.161 --> 01:12:05.802]  Hundreds of children, hundreds of victims, insufficient evidence.
[01:12:06.102 --> 01:12:10.464]  He's also the lawyer who fought that illegal immigrants can get benefits.
[01:12:10.924 --> 01:12:12.425]  He also was successful in that as well.
[01:12:12.905 --> 01:12:13.746]  He's a communist.
[01:12:13.967 --> 01:12:20.375]  We are living in Soviet Britain and at least the public, you see the little clips you're seeing now again, they wouldn't let the public see that.
[01:12:20.395 --> 01:12:27.864]  If they get rid of Elon Musk, if they get rid of X, free speech and the British public are going to be totally under their control.
[01:12:28.505 --> 01:12:29.466]  And that's why they hate me.
[01:12:29.626 --> 01:12:30.907]  They don't hate me because I broke any laws.
[01:12:30.927 --> 01:12:32.047]  I don't break any laws.
[01:12:32.267 --> 01:12:33.608]  I'm an uncontrollable journalist.
[01:12:33.688 --> 01:12:38.171]  And listen to that jerk-off's message there of threats of imprisonment for sharing news.
[01:12:38.651 --> 01:12:41.493]  I will, we will, continue to share the news.
[01:12:41.793 --> 01:12:43.434]  We will continue to show the public.
[01:12:43.634 --> 01:12:45.055]  And you will have to imprison us.
[01:12:45.555 --> 01:12:46.536]  You will have to imprison us.
[01:12:46.556 --> 01:12:47.357]  And let me raise this now.
[01:12:47.437 --> 01:12:48.918]  Let me raise this now, because I've known you...
[01:12:49.838 --> 01:12:53.640]  I've been interviewing you since you hit the screens for exposing the Muslim grooming gangs.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.140]  You were proven right about that.
[01:12:56.341 --> 01:12:58.822]  But I've been interviewing you for 15 years since you got started.
[01:12:59.722 --> 01:13:03.424]  Now, Tommy, you are everywhere.
[01:13:03.444 --> 01:13:04.804]  Like you said, it's 50 million a day now.
[01:13:06.365 --> 01:13:08.566]  You've got to stay out of the UK for now.
[01:13:09.622 --> 01:13:10.923]  They're going to kill you in jail.
[01:13:10.943 --> 01:13:12.104]  I don't want it to be scary.
[01:13:12.424 --> 01:13:16.067]  They've got to create a message to threaten everybody else.
[01:13:16.447 --> 01:13:19.949]  You are so important and powerful now on the air.
[01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:20.630]  Please.
[01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:23.012]  You were online a few days ago saying, I'm going back.
[01:13:23.072 --> 01:13:24.152]  I'll face the false charges.
[01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:25.213]  It's a fraud.
[01:13:25.393 --> 01:13:25.794]  Please.
[01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:26.614]  We know you're tough.
[01:13:27.395 --> 01:13:28.195]  Your mom's Irish.
[01:13:28.235 --> 01:13:28.616]  We get it.
[01:13:28.656 --> 01:13:30.277]  But please don't get in the enemy trap.
[01:13:34.591 --> 01:13:36.252]  I don't know what I'm going to do, Alex, if I'm honest.
[01:13:36.272 --> 01:13:37.093]  I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:13:37.113 --> 01:13:38.493]  Do you know what I was debating doing?
[01:13:38.894 --> 01:13:39.694]  Organising a rally.
[01:13:40.355 --> 01:13:45.418]  Well, let me just tell you, let me tell you right now, do not go back to the UK.
[01:13:45.458 --> 01:13:46.138]  Stay out of there.
[01:13:46.618 --> 01:13:47.519]  Do whatever you have to.
[01:13:48.019 --> 01:13:49.380]  You can fight them in cyberspace.
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:50.441]  They are so pissed.
[01:13:50.461 --> 01:13:53.763]  You saw that Member of Parliament last night, you tweet saying she wants you arrested.
[01:13:54.043 --> 01:13:56.364]  She wished the UK was still in the EU so they could arrest you.
[01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:58.405]  Please, Tommy, I know you're innocent.
[01:13:58.426 --> 01:13:59.206]  You want to go face it.
[01:13:59.226 --> 01:14:00.006]  You're not a coward.
[01:14:01.027 --> 01:14:03.929]  You're going to be on air kicking their ass politically.
[01:14:04.889 --> 01:14:06.371]  Do you know what they've done?
[01:14:06.391 --> 01:14:07.232]  With these lies.
[01:14:07.452 --> 01:14:12.818]  Like my inbox, my messages, videos, everywhere, is now full of Muslims wanting my blood.
[01:14:12.858 --> 01:14:13.939]  Yeah, they're wanting my blood anyway.
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:21.068]  But now they're all, one got arrested this morning by armed response police officers because he's done a video of a machine gun to send to us to say he's going to shoot me dead.
[01:14:21.488 --> 01:14:30.172]  So they have wound up the entire British Islamic community to tell them that I've orchestrated the violence and attacks against their members of their community.
[01:14:30.533 --> 01:14:33.174]  Nick Lowes and Hope Not Hate, they go on about misinformation.
[01:14:33.434 --> 01:14:38.997]  Hope Not Hate, a government-funded NGO with senior Labour politicians on their board, may put out
[01:14:39.437 --> 01:14:44.500]  He put out a statement saying that a Muslim woman has been attacked with acid by English Defence League supporters.
[01:14:44.721 --> 01:14:47.963]  There is no English Defence League and there was no woman ever attacked with acid.
[01:14:48.263 --> 01:14:49.904]  Now this heightens the tensions.
[01:14:50.164 --> 01:14:52.546]  If anyone should get done for misinformation, it's these groups.
[01:14:52.846 --> 01:15:01.171]  These groups have made up a hundred hoax rallies in order to get the public on the street, which has resulted in innocent men like this walking down the street getting violently beaten.
[01:15:01.412 --> 01:15:03.273]  The problem is the media don't report this.
[01:15:03.633 --> 01:15:05.254]  We have a totally controlled media.
[01:15:05.534 --> 01:15:07.314]  That is why we're such a danger to them.
[01:15:07.695 --> 01:15:08.595]  We're such a danger.
[01:15:08.815 --> 01:15:10.516]  We're a danger because we're showing the public.
[01:15:10.536 --> 01:15:11.136]  And do you know what?
[01:15:11.436 --> 01:15:15.738]  The reason why my Twitter ex account is flying through the roof is because the public want to see it.
[01:15:16.018 --> 01:15:17.198]  The public want to know the truth.
[01:15:17.218 --> 01:15:18.699]  They don't want some filtered nonsense.
[01:15:19.019 --> 01:15:23.080]  Some, we're managing, we're managing the situation or managing what the public know.
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:24.101]  Tell them the truth.
[01:15:24.421 --> 01:15:26.542]  The problem is that bad that they need to know the truth.
[01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:28.282]  That there's massive problems.
[01:15:28.362 --> 01:15:29.823]  Even today, they go on about
[01:15:30.223 --> 01:15:35.285]  They're spending all this money now for all these big arrests and preventing the far right, protecting the mosque.
[01:15:35.565 --> 01:15:36.786]  Protect our borders!
[01:15:37.506 --> 01:15:39.007]  Protect our borders!
[01:15:39.547 --> 01:15:41.668]  Send the military to protect our borders!
[01:15:41.928 --> 01:15:43.649]  Our women are being raped, it's not a joke!
[01:15:44.129 --> 01:15:48.090]  Our women are not safe and you keep bringing them in and you've just turned.
[01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.951]  They've turned.
[01:15:49.051 --> 01:15:54.373]  When we had 100,000 people on the street, the entire country is rebelling against mass immigration.
[01:15:54.753 --> 01:15:58.955]  They've turned it all to make it that anyone who says a word is far-right and racist and indispensable.
[01:15:59.235 --> 01:16:02.217]  They've had a successful campaign over the last seven days.
[01:16:02.457 --> 01:16:11.521]  They've manipulated it, orchestrated it, riled up all the Muslims, made up a hundred demonstrations, and all the headlines now are, we beat the racists, we stopped the riots.
[01:16:11.741 --> 01:16:12.822]  You let the riots happen.
[01:16:13.082 --> 01:16:14.603]  You organised the riots.
[01:16:15.023 --> 01:16:16.484]  You manipulated the riots.
[01:16:16.824 --> 01:16:28.952]  Now you're imprisoning young kids who are angry, disenfranchised, neglected, forgotten, English kids, angry with the system, angry at being neglected, angry at being second rate.
[01:16:29.833 --> 01:16:32.736]  And now you're banging them all in jail for three years, four years.
[01:16:33.137 --> 01:16:34.879]  What about the Muslims who attacked the police officers?
[01:16:35.199 --> 01:16:36.721]  What about them in Manchester Airport?
[01:16:37.202 --> 01:16:40.225]  How can you, within seven days, be locking all these people up?
[01:16:40.586 --> 01:16:45.672]  Where's the Romanian and the Muslims that burnt buses, that burnt police cars, that attacked violently police officers?
[01:16:45.912 --> 01:16:47.034]  How come none of them are in jail?
[01:16:47.254 --> 01:16:47.634]  None of them!
[01:16:47.995 --> 01:16:48.375]  How come?
[01:16:49.016 --> 01:16:50.257]  How come none of them?
[01:16:50.837 --> 01:16:53.139]  And this is what everyone's watching.
[01:16:53.419 --> 01:16:54.500]  And I may sound frustrated.
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:57.762]  I'm frustrated because journalists have been for the last week.
[01:16:58.102 --> 01:16:59.383]  They come to find out where I was.
[01:16:59.603 --> 01:17:00.964]  They let the world know where I was.
[01:17:01.204 --> 01:17:05.647]  They are purposely, they've done it with Pim Fortuyn in Holland.
[01:17:05.948 --> 01:17:10.130]  They build this character and then they encourage until someone tries to kill you.
[01:17:10.371 --> 01:17:11.892]  They don't even have to get their hands dirty.
[01:17:12.232 --> 01:17:13.653]  They wind everyone else up with lies.
[01:17:14.193 --> 01:17:15.114]  Total lies!
[01:17:15.354 --> 01:17:17.216]  There is no evidence I've encouraged violence.
[01:17:17.516 --> 01:17:19.458]  No evidence I was involved in these demonstrations.
[01:17:19.778 --> 01:17:21.099]  No evidence I organised them.
[01:17:21.219 --> 01:17:21.440]  None!
[01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:22.781]  I wasn't involved.
[01:17:23.041 --> 01:17:28.526]  I merely made videos as a commentator, which is what I do as a journalist, and show people what was happening.
[01:17:28.566 --> 01:17:31.248]  Not what the media was showing, because the media are just showing English people.
[01:17:31.488 --> 01:17:32.529]  They're not telling people why.
[01:17:32.549 --> 01:17:33.710]  They're not showing police reactions.
[01:17:33.951 --> 01:17:34.971]  They're not showing them arresting.
[01:17:35.714 --> 01:17:37.937]  Grandmothers throwing English women on the floor.
[01:17:38.137 --> 01:17:40.379]  They're not showing why the public are so angry.
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:43.663]  And because our borders are open, our country's changing.
[01:17:43.884 --> 01:17:44.865]  They're totally spun it.
[01:17:45.225 --> 01:17:53.475]  It's been a massively successful government campaign under a communist regime who wish to take away freedom of speech, take away freedom of movement and end freedom of the press.
[01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:57.359]  Citizen journalism is the answer to these problems.
[01:17:57.599 --> 01:17:58.680]  And they have to stop it.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:00.702]  And to stop it, they have to stop Elon Musk.
[01:18:00.942 --> 01:18:05.607]  They have to stop X. If they take out X, we are ruled under communism already.
[01:18:06.307 --> 01:18:06.988]  Totally ruled.
[01:18:07.168 --> 01:18:09.190]  At the minute, they don't know what to do.
[01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:10.351]  They don't know what to do.
[01:18:11.112 --> 01:18:11.993]  I agree.
[01:18:12.013 --> 01:18:13.514]  They're in total panic mode.
[01:18:13.574 --> 01:18:15.256]  Now they're calling for Elon Musk arrest.
[01:18:15.736 --> 01:18:18.079]  Now members of parliament are calling for Elon Musk arrest.
[01:18:19.329 --> 01:18:19.929]  Panic mode.
[01:18:19.969 --> 01:18:20.929]  They don't know what to do.
[01:18:20.949 --> 01:18:25.391]  And the problem is, they're used to threatening people, arresting people, scaring people, making them silent.
[01:18:25.551 --> 01:18:26.331]  It's not going to work.
[01:18:26.851 --> 01:18:27.831]  We're not backing down.
[01:18:28.231 --> 01:18:29.612]  I'm not going to shut up.
[01:18:29.632 --> 01:18:30.112]  I'm right.
[01:18:30.132 --> 01:18:31.532]  I will be proven right.
[01:18:31.892 --> 01:18:35.133]  I think I said 15 years ago, my videos age very well.
[01:18:35.173 --> 01:18:35.633]  Yours don't.
[01:18:35.653 --> 01:18:36.154]  OK?
[01:18:36.494 --> 01:18:37.054]  Yours don't.
[01:18:37.494 --> 01:18:38.894]  We are standing up for what's right.
[01:18:38.914 --> 01:18:39.895]  We're standing up for our children.
[01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:40.795]  We're standing up for our country.
[01:18:40.815 --> 01:18:41.515]  And we're not going to stop.
[01:18:41.935 --> 01:18:43.557]  We're not going to stop so you can enslave everyone.
[01:18:43.957 --> 01:18:44.718]  It's not happening.
[01:18:44.978 --> 01:18:50.803]  We're not becoming minorities in our own country so you can flood it with hostile, violent migrants.
[01:18:51.224 --> 01:18:52.044]  That's the reality.
[01:18:52.265 --> 01:18:53.806]  These aren't women and children.
[01:18:54.266 --> 01:18:56.068]  They're not women and children fleeing war zones.
[01:18:56.148 --> 01:18:57.990]  And by the way, Tommy, let me stop you.
[01:18:58.690 --> 01:19:01.013]  We've got national UK TV Sky.
[01:19:02.663 --> 01:19:07.066]  Alex, I've got to go on this one.
[01:19:07.486 --> 01:19:07.946]  Sorry, man.
[01:19:08.307 --> 01:19:11.909]  If that's three minutes early, I've got to go for this phone call.
[01:19:11.969 --> 01:19:13.710]  I've got a few problems going on with the family.
[01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:14.611]  I understand, brother.
[01:19:14.631 --> 01:19:15.451]  Take the call.
[01:19:15.491 --> 01:19:15.771]  Thank you.
[01:19:15.791 --> 01:19:15.991]  Cool.
[01:19:16.512 --> 01:19:16.892]  Cheers, man.
[01:19:16.912 --> 01:19:17.412]  Cheers.
[01:19:18.033 --> 01:19:19.954]  So that guy is in a total emergency.
[01:19:20.614 --> 01:19:22.075]  You can see how real all this is.
[01:19:23.836 --> 01:19:24.437]  He is hunted.
[01:19:25.373 --> 01:19:26.515]  So here's the clip I was talking about.
[01:19:26.636 --> 01:19:32.527]  UK authorities begin to arrest citizens for social media posts containing inaccurate information.
[01:19:32.567 --> 01:19:33.469]  And they define that.
[01:19:33.489 --> 01:19:33.769]  Here it is.
[01:19:34.394 --> 01:19:47.799]  We have some breaking news now and a woman has been arrested by Cheshire Police in relation to an inaccurate information on social media about the attacker in the Southport murders.
[01:19:47.839 --> 01:20:01.743]  It says a 55-year-old woman from near Chester was arrested earlier today, Thursday the 8th of course, on suspicion of publishing written material to stir up racial hatred and false communications.
[01:20:01.823 --> 01:20:03.164]  She is currently being held
[01:20:03.664 --> 01:20:05.045]  in police custody.
[01:20:06.106 --> 01:20:22.202]  Chief Superintendent Alison Ross has also made a statement saying that this is in relation to a post which has been fuelled by malicious, the process rather, has been fuelled by malicious and inaccurate communications online.
[01:20:22.902 --> 01:20:31.168]  It is a stark reminder of the dangers of posting information on social media platforms without checking the accuracy.
[01:20:31.528 --> 01:20:35.752]  It's also a warning that we are all accountable for our actions.
[01:20:36.772 --> 01:20:39.634]  Oh, you're all accountable if they say it's disinfo?
[01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:41.276]  We're gonna arrest you.
[01:20:41.316 --> 01:20:42.737]  The globalists are in deep trouble.
[01:20:44.558 --> 01:20:45.619]  Their system is collapsing.
[01:20:45.639 --> 01:20:49.101]  I've just done an hour and 26 minutes of live radio.
[01:20:49.121 --> 01:20:49.322]  27 minutes.
[01:20:49.342 --> 01:20:49.762]  Hour and 27 minutes.
[01:20:52.216 --> 01:20:54.298]  Without plugging, I need your support.
[01:20:55.159 --> 01:20:57.261]  I need to say, wow, these guys are fighting for freedom.
[01:20:57.301 --> 01:20:58.142]  They're fighting for me.
[01:20:58.483 --> 01:20:59.123]  They're standing up.
[01:20:59.143 --> 01:21:00.245]  They're putting their lives on the line.

[01:22:11.996 --> 01:22:13.096]  You're the only reason we're still on air.
[01:22:13.456 --> 01:22:14.417]  Thanks for being in the fight.
[01:22:15.117 --> 01:22:17.598]  Those of you on the fence, this isn't some Netflix show.
[01:22:17.618 --> 01:22:18.418]  This isn't entertainment.
[01:22:18.658 --> 01:22:20.318]  This is the war for the future of humanity.
[01:22:21.639 --> 01:22:27.481]  Now, Laura Logan, amazing journalist, in studio, coming up after this break.
[01:22:27.921 --> 01:22:30.141]  But first, a John Bowne report.
[01:22:30.842 --> 01:22:31.582]  Stay with us.
[01:22:32.386 --> 01:22:34.468]  The InfoWars system is very simple.
[01:22:34.668 --> 01:22:39.232]  We tell you the truth about what's going on in the world, and we ask that you support us in exchange.
[01:22:39.372 --> 01:22:42.275]  If we don't tell you the truth, you probably won't support us.
[01:22:42.615 --> 01:22:43.816]  That's our only incentive.
[01:22:43.956 --> 01:22:46.458]  All we have is you, the InfoWars audience.
[01:22:46.999 --> 01:22:54.966]  And just like our information has to be good, or else we can't expect your support, well, our products have to be good, or we can't expect you to be returning customers.
[01:22:54.986 --> 01:22:58.829]  And everybody knows some of the bombshell, incredible, iconic
[01:22:59.930 --> 01:23:00.550]  We're good to go.
[01:23:22.415 --> 01:23:25.536]  And as a woman, there is a balance to be struck between being tough and being a bitch.
[01:23:52.387 --> 01:24:01.869]  Turn that off!
[01:24:02.909 --> 01:24:04.609]  You know, we have to stay woke.
[01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:09.231]  Like, everybody needs to be woke.
[01:24:09.551 --> 01:24:14.772]  And you can talk about if you're the wokest or woker, but just stay more woke than less woke.
[01:24:16.493 --> 01:24:22.598]  In a banana republic, it is common for the military and police to be on high alert when election day comes.
[01:24:23.099 --> 01:24:29.565]  But in the United States, the idea of being on high alert after election day was ludicrous until now.
[01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:38.904]  A nationwide concern about election day.
[01:24:39.404 --> 01:24:44.025]  I felt like I had no choice but to do what I did.
[01:24:44.045 --> 01:24:45.765]  So yeah, kill them.
[01:24:46.385 --> 01:24:47.086]  Kill the Nazis.
[01:24:47.126 --> 01:24:50.846]  Long live the socialist revolution!
[01:24:50.886 --> 01:24:58.408]  When conditions become right, people do get the opportunity to change the whole system through a revolutionary struggle.
[01:25:06.275 --> 01:25:16.157]  The propaganda dung beetles of CNN quasi-journalism spread one lie after another to foment the chaos.
[01:25:16.297 --> 01:25:19.238]  We have a disinformation network in this country, right?
[01:25:19.258 --> 01:25:23.579]  You know, the top cable news channel is at its core a disinformation network.
[01:25:24.079 --> 01:25:28.200]  We have people with large online followings who push disinformation on a regular basis.
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.124]  Right, in 2000 there weren't buildings being boarded up in major cities.
[01:25:32.164 --> 01:25:40.053]  Now look, let's be honest, probably that's happening, Susan, because some business owners are worried about liberal protests in the event of a Trump win.
[01:25:40.353 --> 01:25:44.277]  But there's also this dynamic of fear of unrest in an event of a Trump loss.
[01:25:44.297 --> 01:25:49.883]  I just want to give a heartfelt thank you to a lot of people for
[01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:56.958]  For the peace and the generosity, the kindness and the love that's been shown on our streets of Minneapolis, St.
[01:25:56.978 --> 01:26:02.383]  Paul and across Minnesota over the last several days and last evening was another example of that.
[01:26:02.903 --> 01:26:07.747]  We saw peaceful protests across the city.
[01:26:08.288 --> 01:26:16.855]  We saw memorials continue to grow for George Floyd down on 38th and Chicago.
[01:26:17.796 --> 01:26:18.257]  We saw
[01:26:19.753 --> 01:26:22.154]  Beautiful interactions on the State Capitol.
[01:26:22.875 --> 01:26:23.835]  We're out of respect.
[01:26:25.076 --> 01:26:34.562]  The National Guard troops there told the protesters out of respect they would go back away to the building and just take care of those vehicles that were out front, which of course they did.
[01:26:36.763 --> 01:26:39.245]  Not protesters at that point.
[01:26:40.005 --> 01:26:44.768]  Certainly neighbors and friends and agents of change.
[01:26:45.416 --> 01:26:48.938]  Kamala Harris named Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.
[01:26:49.378 --> 01:26:56.722]  Walz is a former school teacher and seasoned Washington lawmaker who has been credited with a new political insult against Republicans.
[01:26:57.283 --> 01:26:58.023]  Yes, they're weird.
[01:26:58.323 --> 01:26:59.324]  They prove that every day.
[01:26:59.384 --> 01:27:00.184]  It's an observation.
[01:27:00.805 --> 01:27:02.105]  How many chances do you get?
[01:27:05.207 --> 01:27:09.390]  My answer to that is as many chances as you need.
[01:27:10.650 --> 01:27:13.532]  Which doesn't really please those law and order people.
[01:27:14.972 --> 01:27:24.136]  When our children tell us who they are, it is our job as grown-ups to listen and to believe them.
[01:27:30.999 --> 01:27:32.640]  That's what it means to be a good parent.
[01:27:34.192 --> 01:27:35.194]  But we can get out there.
[01:27:35.474 --> 01:27:35.955]  Reach out.
[01:27:36.195 --> 01:27:36.716]  Make the case.
[01:27:36.996 --> 01:27:40.582]  And for one thing, don't ever shy away from our progressive values.
[01:27:41.202 --> 01:27:43.746]  One person's socialism is another person's neighborliness.
[01:27:43.846 --> 01:27:44.267]  Alright, ready.
[01:27:44.648 --> 01:27:45.349]  Whoa, wait a minute.
[01:28:00.003 --> 01:28:04.388]  Well, nobody said the New World Order trying to take over would not be exciting.
[01:28:05.409 --> 01:28:10.435]  Anybody that's bored watching Netflix, that's because you're watching fiction rather than reality.
[01:28:10.455 --> 01:28:20.025]  It's been said by many historians, truth is way stranger and more dangerous and more invigorating and more horrifying and more empowering than fiction.
[01:28:21.317 --> 01:28:24.639]  So the great journalist, Laura Logan, is in studio with us.
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:28.042]  Follow her on X at LauraLogan and LauraLogan.com.
[01:28:28.382 --> 01:28:29.603]  Host her own popular talk show.
[01:28:29.643 --> 01:28:31.824]  Hell, she already taped a couple of big interviews.
[01:28:31.864 --> 01:28:36.767]  She did the War Room for C-Band today and some other big shows she did while she's at her studio.
[01:28:36.787 --> 01:28:37.648]  She's a fellow Texan.
[01:28:38.008 --> 01:28:40.930]  We love having her here with us and she wants to cover the waterfront.
[01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:49.596]  Big breaking news, what really happened in Afghanistan, what's happening in Europe, what's happening in the UK, what's happening in the election, the stolen valor, the attempted Trump assassination.
[01:28:49.616 --> 01:28:50.717]  When she was here seven weeks ago,
[01:28:51.377 --> 01:28:55.719]  The feds, outside of court order, were trying to close the doors.
[01:28:55.779 --> 01:28:56.439]  We stood up to them.
[01:28:56.459 --> 01:28:57.680]  The judge shut them down.
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:02.202]  We're still here for now, and I'm giving people updates on that, but what a crazy time to be alive.
[01:29:03.002 --> 01:29:04.183]  Yeah, it is pretty crazy.
[01:29:04.203 --> 01:29:06.344]  Remember, I told you, I said, this isn't about me.
[01:29:06.364 --> 01:29:07.244]  They're gonna try to kill Trump.
[01:29:07.685 --> 01:29:11.846]  On air that day, I said, they're making a big move when they sent the Justice Department here to shut us down without a court order.
[01:29:12.247 --> 01:29:13.167]  How crazy is that?
[01:29:13.487 --> 01:29:14.428]  These are like vigilantes.
[01:29:15.108 --> 01:29:18.329]  Well, it's always been about, uh, not, it's never been about Trump, right?
[01:29:18.349 --> 01:29:19.430]  It's always been about the people.
[01:29:20.563 --> 01:29:20.903]  It is.
[01:29:21.684 --> 01:29:23.545]  So it's great to have you here.
[01:29:23.665 --> 01:29:25.146]  You want to start with what's happening in the UK?
[01:29:25.166 --> 01:29:26.667]  I know you've been following that in depth.
[01:29:27.627 --> 01:29:39.934]  Well, what's incredible to me, the one thing I've been posting, trying to get people to understand, is when you're having the same conversation in the United Kingdom, and the exact same issues happening, that tells you that the policy behind it is exactly the same, right?
[01:29:39.954 --> 01:29:42.376]  The people behind it are exactly the same.
[01:29:42.996 --> 01:29:47.459]  And to see people being arrested because of what they're posting on social media,
[01:29:48.459 --> 01:29:50.961]  It's so blatant what's happening in the UK.
[01:29:51.001 --> 01:29:58.627]  I mean, you know, in the old days, you might have looked at somebody like Tommy Robinson and thought, OK, well, do I want to post this person because I don't want to be accused of being far right?
[01:29:59.007 --> 01:30:02.170]  And now you see, wait a minute, this is ridiculous.
[01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:11.957]  They are literally they are literally attacking and arresting the people who are standing up, who are saying, hey, we have a problem in this country.
[01:30:11.977 --> 01:30:17.662]  You know, young girls in a dance class were murdered, hacked to death.
[01:30:18.762 --> 01:30:21.565]  And the media is being dishonest about how they're reporting this.
[01:30:21.645 --> 01:30:22.966]  Our leaders are being dishonest.
[01:30:23.327 --> 01:30:24.888]  I mean, people have had it, Alex.
[01:30:25.028 --> 01:30:25.549]  You know this.
[01:30:25.649 --> 01:30:27.971]  And they're blaming the journalist, Tommy.
[01:30:28.832 --> 01:30:32.595]  So watching this, and again, you're obviously a journalist.
[01:30:32.615 --> 01:30:33.756]  You're always up to speed on everything.
[01:30:33.776 --> 01:30:38.641]  But we have clips of the national police saying, if you show a Muslim riot, we'll put you in jail.
[01:30:38.681 --> 01:30:39.802]  And now they're arresting people.
[01:30:40.102 --> 01:30:42.004]  That shows not strength but desperation.
[01:30:42.537 --> 01:31:02.225]  Well, and not only that, did you see the woman, I believe she's kind of like the Secretary of Homeland Security, did you see when she said, you will be arrested, you will be convicted, so don't worry about the legal process, you will be convicted, and she said you will go to jail and you will also be subject to travel bans.
[01:31:02.765 --> 01:31:08.388]  I just want to know when travel bans became part of the law and the standard.
[01:31:08.448 --> 01:31:09.568]  That's the social credit score.
[01:31:10.129 --> 01:31:10.369]  Yes!
[01:31:11.269 --> 01:31:13.612]  But now they're openly saying it.
[01:31:14.814 --> 01:31:15.815]  Which is just staggering.
[01:31:15.915 --> 01:31:16.316]  I agree with you.
[01:31:16.336 --> 01:31:18.919]  These clips out of the UK, I've got like 10 of them, are so chilling.
[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:20.782]  It's like 1984 for real.
[01:31:20.822 --> 01:31:23.165]  I can't believe they're like pure the baddies.
[01:31:23.465 --> 01:31:24.467]  They're just being pure evil.
[01:31:24.963 --> 01:31:25.183]  Yeah.
[01:31:25.964 --> 01:31:27.444]  And they're not even hiding it at this point.
[01:31:27.464 --> 01:31:35.228]  I mean, you've got literally people, surely people across the UK are looking at this and saying, wait a minute, little girls were murdered.
[01:31:36.288 --> 01:31:39.210]  And you're saying if you object to that, you're going to go to jail.
[01:31:39.250 --> 01:31:40.250]  What does that remind you of?
[01:31:40.571 --> 01:31:49.315]  That reminds you of parents going to school board meetings because they wanted to have a say in their children's education being targeted by the Attorney General.
[01:31:49.955 --> 01:31:51.677]  As being domestic terrorists, right?
[01:31:51.737 --> 01:31:52.938]  It's exactly the same thing.
[01:31:53.218 --> 01:31:58.782]  And when you see the same thing happening, it means the same policy and the same people are behind it.
[01:31:58.802 --> 01:32:05.928]  Well, that's key that you say that, because COVID, they admit, was run by the UN, the WF, was the same policy, whether you're in New Zealand or Canada or the US or Germany.
[01:32:06.488 --> 01:32:07.169]  It's the globalists.
[01:32:07.898 --> 01:32:13.280]  Yeah, and you know, this is one thing I keep banging on about this, and people don't really pay much attention to it.
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:19.101]  But if you want to know why the southern border is open, well, look at the Open Society Foundation.
[01:32:19.762 --> 01:32:23.623]  That's why, because we have open border ideologues inside the administration.
[01:32:23.963 --> 01:32:30.185]  And not only that, at the United Nations, they had a global compact on migration.
[01:32:30.505 --> 01:32:32.686]  They made migration a human right.
[01:32:33.046 --> 01:32:36.887]  And so what they said is, it can't be illegal if you're exercising your human rights.
[01:32:37.887 --> 01:32:44.631]  And so that is why the Biden administration, as soon as they took office, said no one's allowed to use the word illegal anymore when it comes to immigration.
[01:32:44.671 --> 01:32:46.132]  And then we all do it and say migrant.
[01:32:46.172 --> 01:32:47.013]  Exactly.
[01:32:47.173 --> 01:32:54.057]  Because now you are looking at the globalist policy on migration that has been implemented in your country.
[01:32:54.317 --> 01:32:55.798]  You didn't get a chance to vote on it.
[01:32:56.118 --> 01:32:57.499]  They bypassed the legislature.
[01:32:57.519 --> 01:32:58.640]  They bypassed Congress.
[01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:00.421]  I mean, they bypassed the people.
[01:33:00.581 --> 01:33:01.902]  And they bring in groups they control.
[01:33:02.785 --> 01:33:14.831]  Well, you know, let's see how they control them, because the groups that they're bringing in... I mean, I'll tell you, Alex, about some of the things that... I was about to say, that's the... You know about Islamists, since you've been all over the world, famously attacked by them, without getting into detail.
[01:33:15.791 --> 01:33:19.973]  I mean, they're really... made a mistake here.
[01:33:22.182 --> 01:33:25.745]  Well, I don't know what you mean by made a mistake precisely.
[01:33:25.765 --> 01:33:29.067]  Well, you said the globalists think they can control these Islamic hordes.
[01:33:29.127 --> 01:33:31.009]  I was reading into what you're saying.
[01:33:31.029 --> 01:33:32.530]  You think they're going to bite them in the ass.
[01:33:33.356 --> 01:33:39.360]  Well, the Arabs have a saying, actually, that when you let a snake into your garden, eventually it makes its way into your house.
[01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:42.842]  And we've seen that happen all over the world, right?
[01:33:42.882 --> 01:33:47.726]  You know what's interesting, though, Alex, is I know a gentleman who infiltrated the global cult.
[01:33:48.126 --> 01:33:51.508]  And the part of the global cult, he did this on behalf of the United States government.
[01:33:51.528 --> 01:33:53.409]  He spent years in training underground.
[01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:56.431]  But he was assigned to the Islamic faction.
[01:33:56.872 --> 01:34:02.796]  So I think one of the things that I always try to remember here, when I think about him and the work that he did, is that
[01:34:03.496 --> 01:34:04.998]  This is a global cult.
[01:34:05.018 --> 01:34:06.239]  Islam is only one arm.
[01:34:06.599 --> 01:34:09.642]  But there is an Islamist faction among the globalists.
[01:34:09.722 --> 01:34:12.625]  It's not just, you know, the deep state in America.
[01:34:12.905 --> 01:34:14.386]  I mean, think about it.
[01:34:14.466 --> 01:34:23.635]  Islamic jihad is a way to control the Muslim population as much as socialism is a control mechanism to control Western politics.
[01:34:23.655 --> 01:34:25.437]  And that's why socialism is allied with Islam.
[01:34:26.297 --> 01:34:26.597]  Yes!
[01:34:27.618 --> 01:34:34.685]  And I don't think people pay enough attention to this, the history and the relationship between Islam and the left.
[01:34:34.765 --> 01:34:42.792]  But all of these are control mechanisms that come back to a small group of people whose agenda is profoundly anti-human, right?
[01:34:43.132 --> 01:34:51.400]  And one of the reasons, and one of the most important strategic arms of their agenda is the Open Society Foundation and the Open Borders.
[01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:56.441]  And when you look at that now, you look at what does this mean for America right now?
[01:34:56.882 --> 01:35:06.185]  Well, I mean, Europe is the living, breathing example of what happens to your country when you become completely, your own culture becomes completely overwhelmed.
[01:35:06.505 --> 01:35:09.986]  There is a political agenda behind this and a cultural agenda.
[01:35:10.886 --> 01:35:30.142]  And what I was working on reporting earlier was just the relationship between the Chinese and the Chinese Communist Party and basically the Islamic terrorist state that we created in Afghanistan, as well as their relationship with the cartels, both the Mexican cartels and the Venezuelan cartels.
[01:35:30.542 --> 01:35:33.745]  Because we have a serious problem in this country.
[01:35:34.646 --> 01:35:39.090]  The picture that I've been investigating for the last couple of years, Alex, started with the question
[01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:43.754]  Are the cartels really the army of the deep state and the globalists?
[01:35:43.814 --> 01:35:44.814]  Is that what you're looking at?
[01:35:45.135 --> 01:35:59.347]  Because at the end of the day, although the United States military has been decimated with this ideology, I don't believe that most Americans who will put on a uniform in the service of this country will ever go to war against their own country.
[01:35:59.367 --> 01:36:01.108]  And that's why Pelosi called MS-13 God's Children.
[01:36:01.909 --> 01:36:05.592]  And that's why you need, that's why you need to have the cartels as your real army.
[01:36:05.632 --> 01:36:24.589]  And I want you to get into all that in your Afghanistan research, we'll do that in a moment, but finishing up with the UK and the open, if you show Muslims rioting we're gonna put you in jail, and making up there was a hundred riots which wasn't true, and this new prime minister they've got we know is working with Obama, where do you see that going?
[01:36:25.427 --> 01:36:26.088]  No, we're good.
[01:36:26.508 --> 01:36:26.709]  Right?
[01:36:26.749 --> 01:36:27.770]  I mean, I'm not a prophet.
[01:36:28.110 --> 01:36:29.031]  I'm just a journalist.
[01:36:29.452 --> 01:36:31.294]  But it's very, very obvious here.
[01:36:31.635 --> 01:36:38.403]  I think one of the encouraging things is that so many people in the UK are saying they don't care.
[01:36:38.683 --> 01:36:43.128]  They've reached the point now where it's gone beyond anything that
[01:36:44.290 --> 01:36:51.640]  I mean this really is becoming a moment in history where you either stand for something or you stand for nothing and you lose everything.
[01:36:52.141 --> 01:36:55.005]  And that seems to be what is happening all over the UK.
[01:36:55.366 --> 01:36:58.150]  And that's scaring the left because they know the people are awake.
[01:36:58.769 --> 01:37:00.490]  Well, and it's not just in the UK.
[01:37:00.850 --> 01:37:03.772]  I mean, look at what is happening in France.
[01:37:03.932 --> 01:37:05.093]  France is in real trouble.
[01:37:05.393 --> 01:37:06.854]  The Netherlands is in real trouble.
[01:37:07.014 --> 01:37:08.315]  Italy is in real trouble.
[01:37:08.335 --> 01:37:10.357]  I mean, this is all over Europe.
[01:37:10.997 --> 01:37:18.502]  And it's quite interesting to me because you'll hear people be very critical of Donald Trump when you, I mean, Europeans and British people.
[01:37:18.822 --> 01:37:24.446]  But when you hear them then talk about the immigration problem in their own country, they sound exactly like Trump.
[01:37:25.126 --> 01:37:26.247]  You know, they don't want to admit it.
[01:37:26.768 --> 01:37:36.056]  When it comes to the Islamic problem, they feel like they're able to talk about that freely now because now the threat to their own culture is very, very real.
[01:37:36.076 --> 01:37:36.717]  And let's be clear.
[01:37:37.117 --> 01:37:38.118]  I don't want to kill the Muslims.
[01:37:38.138 --> 01:37:38.759]  I'm not their enemy.
[01:37:38.799 --> 01:37:41.121]  But they believe they have a right to rule the world.
[01:37:41.601 --> 01:37:43.323]  Every other place they take over, they rule it.
[01:37:43.363 --> 01:37:44.304]  They push everybody else out.
[01:37:44.704 --> 01:37:46.506]  So you were bringing in an incompatible group.
[01:37:50.188 --> 01:37:51.709]  This is what I say to people, Alex.
[01:37:51.789 --> 01:37:53.629]  I mean, I spent five years living in Iraq.
[01:37:53.989 --> 01:37:55.370]  I spent years in Afghanistan.
[01:37:55.490 --> 01:37:56.590]  I've been all over the Middle East.
[01:37:56.650 --> 01:38:00.372]  Syria, Jordan, Palestinian territories, Hebron, Gaza, Ramallah.
[01:38:00.432 --> 01:38:01.372]  I mean, you name it.
[01:38:01.652 --> 01:38:03.133]  You got famously attacked in Egypt.
[01:38:03.153 --> 01:38:04.133]  You don't make a big deal about that.
[01:38:04.173 --> 01:38:09.735]  But I mean, you could be in a group in Europe or America or even Latin America with men out at night.
[01:38:09.775 --> 01:38:10.435]  That wouldn't happen.
[01:38:10.515 --> 01:38:11.956]  I mean, it's just something different.
[01:38:12.276 --> 01:38:18.759]  Well, I mean, you know, gang rape and those kind of things happen all over the world, and I think there was a political dimension to the attack on me.
[01:38:19.159 --> 01:38:20.399]  But this is what I would say to people.
[01:38:20.419 --> 01:38:26.442]  I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but it's like, it's like a, it's like part of Islam that Mohammed married a six-year-old, consummated at nine years.
[01:38:26.462 --> 01:38:27.922]  I mean, it's part of the cult.
[01:38:28.103 --> 01:38:32.184]  Without a doubt, when it comes to Sharia law and the treatment of women.
[01:38:32.344 --> 01:38:33.645]  And they blame women when they get attacked.
[01:38:34.332 --> 01:38:39.074]  Well, there's no doubt that I would not choose that for my daughter.
[01:38:39.395 --> 01:38:40.615]  And that's what I say to people.
[01:38:40.795 --> 01:38:44.377]  You know, people argue about what the Quran says about women, what it doesn't say about women.
[01:38:44.637 --> 01:38:46.638]  But at the end of the day, for me, it comes down to this.
[01:38:47.079 --> 01:38:49.320]  Tell me, show me as a Western woman,
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:51.040]  Well, that's what Islam does.
[01:39:19.611 --> 01:39:22.472]  Like Christ said to the tree by its fruits, that's what it does, it enslaves women.
[01:39:23.472 --> 01:39:27.172]  Yeah, I mean, definitely it enslaves women, and there's no question about that.
[01:39:27.212 --> 01:39:29.413]  You see it in any Islamic country that you go to.
[01:39:31.053 --> 01:39:32.313]  So where do you see this going?
[01:39:32.933 --> 01:39:33.433]  Big picture.
[01:39:33.833 --> 01:39:36.154]  We'll get into Afghanistan news, you're going to break in all the rest of it.
[01:39:36.694 --> 01:39:46.816]  Trump, the antithesis, we haven't talked, you know, we'll talk some on the phone, but haven't talked since they tried to kill him on July 13th, and what the Democrats are doing with stolen valor of Tim Walz.
[01:39:46.936 --> 01:39:47.776]  I mean, just, this is a...
[01:39:48.823 --> 01:39:49.226]  Shitshow.
[01:39:50.424 --> 01:39:54.305]  Well, I gotta say, Tim Walz is a really terrible choice, right?
[01:39:54.745 --> 01:39:56.165]  I mean, the man is full of holes.
[01:39:56.665 --> 01:39:57.025]  Look at it.
[01:39:57.065 --> 01:40:08.147]  He's being absolutely destroyed all across the media, and they can, you know, they can attack people for questioning his record, his military record, and they can say, you know, that it's right-wing propaganda.
[01:40:08.167 --> 01:40:10.487]  They can do whatever they like, but look at it, Alex.
[01:40:10.527 --> 01:40:12.048]  I mean, it doesn't look good, right?
[01:40:12.088 --> 01:40:14.008]  You left your unit right before they deployed.
[01:40:14.028 --> 01:40:19.429]  I mean, and people... You're not in the military, but you spent years in combat as a combat reporter.
[01:40:20.469 --> 01:40:24.353]  It's one thing to leave, but if you're an officer and leave right at the time, that's like a big no-no.
[01:40:25.294 --> 01:40:29.397]  And then he claimed that he was there and fought on top of it, which is really rubbing it in.
[01:40:29.818 --> 01:40:34.442]  Well, look, I mean, yes, I spent, you know, the better part of 15 years on battlefields.
[01:40:34.842 --> 01:40:38.245]  I'm married to someone who served in the special operations community.
[01:40:38.785 --> 01:40:41.307]  And of course, I know many people from that community.
[01:40:42.128 --> 01:40:45.571]  The biggest no-no is to say that you were in combat when you weren't.
[01:40:46.051 --> 01:40:50.215]  I mean, you know, there are few bigger lies than that to claim.
[01:40:50.255 --> 01:40:51.396]  That's called stolen valor.
[01:40:51.916 --> 01:40:56.260]  And the kind of people that do that are looked upon very poorly.
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:59.643]  But the only thing worse is to desert your unit at the time of battle, which you didn't.
[01:41:00.356 --> 01:41:03.999]  Well, I mean... So he's a deserter and a Stolen Valor?
[01:41:04.019 --> 01:41:07.421]  It doesn't... That's like a royal flush of badness.
[01:41:07.461 --> 01:41:08.882]  Like, that's hard to be that bad.
[01:41:09.182 --> 01:41:10.443]  It's the trifecta.
[01:41:10.984 --> 01:41:14.946]  You're pretty much hitting the trifecta of cowardice, right?
[01:41:15.547 --> 01:41:20.550]  And, I mean, now, I know that there's a lot of pushback on this in the media.
[01:41:20.610 --> 01:41:25.554]  And, you know, I'd want to see... We've been down this road before with John Kerry and George Bush.
[01:41:25.934 --> 01:41:27.274]  So you want to be very careful here.
[01:41:27.314 --> 01:41:28.915]  You want to know what the actual facts are.
[01:41:29.195 --> 01:41:36.077]  But what's interesting about it is that the records on this predate Tim Walz being selected as Kamala Harris's candidate.
[01:41:36.177 --> 01:41:37.718]  Oh, veterans came in front of him in 2009 about it.
[01:41:37.918 --> 01:41:38.178]  Right.
[01:41:38.778 --> 01:41:38.998]  Right.
[01:41:39.038 --> 01:41:41.139]  So that's what adds some credibility to it.
[01:41:41.219 --> 01:41:45.540]  And what it means is that it's definitely worth asking the questions.
[01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:50.442]  And as I understand it, Walz didn't want to answer those questions, right, when confronted by reporters.
[01:41:52.042 --> 01:41:56.307]  Well, I'm not a military guy, but I talked to a bunch of officers that were the same rank as him and those above him.
[01:41:56.708 --> 01:41:58.830]  They read his, what's it called, DS-14?
[01:41:58.850 --> 01:41:59.031]  Yeah, DD-214?
[01:41:59.051 --> 01:41:59.731]  Whatever it is.
[01:41:59.812 --> 01:42:01.033]  I had it in my phone.
[01:42:01.073 --> 01:42:03.396]  They read it and they said, no, this guy's a total fraud.
[01:42:09.335 --> 01:42:12.877]  Well, I can tell you that is the most comprehensive record of your military service.
[01:42:13.378 --> 01:42:26.606]  So, I mean, if you want to know what somebody has done, now, you know, if you're dealing with someone who is in the clandestine realm, you might not find everything on that, well, you won't find everything on that piece of paper, but for the most, for the most part, everything about your service is in that record.
[01:42:29.928 --> 01:42:33.711]  Just gut level, how do you, talk about, what was, where were you when they tried to kill Trump?
[01:42:35.058 --> 01:42:37.802]  Oh, I was in New Jersey, of all places.
[01:42:38.522 --> 01:42:40.945]  I know, in a hotel room in New Jersey with my son.
[01:42:40.965 --> 01:42:44.570]  And, yeah, I mean, I couldn't believe it.
[01:42:46.095 --> 01:42:46.776]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:42:47.016 --> 01:42:51.960]  I mean, you kind of knew that it was coming and, you know, you'd mentioned it in advance.
[01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:54.002]  I'd spoken about this with a lot of other people.
[01:42:54.402 --> 01:42:59.487]  It made complete sense because obviously Trump is in a free and fair election.
[01:42:59.867 --> 01:43:03.030]  Trump is unstoppable at this point.
[01:43:03.370 --> 01:43:05.812]  I mean, it doesn't matter what demographic you're talking about.
[01:43:07.334 --> 01:43:15.605]  You know, whether it's in the cities or whether it's in the rural areas, whether it's Hispanic Americans, African Americans, white Americans, I mean, every age group.
[01:43:16.085 --> 01:43:22.533]  I mean, he is absolutely unstoppable at this point because people have seen the reality.
[01:43:23.274 --> 01:43:25.195]  Um, of what they're facing otherwise.
[01:43:25.255 --> 01:43:29.378]  And, you know, it's not the beginning, for example, of the transgender movement now, right?
[01:43:29.618 --> 01:43:35.981]  We've had enough time for people who've transitioned to come out and say, you know, this was the worst thing that ever happened to me.
[01:43:36.542 --> 01:43:46.407]  Um, I was pushed into this by, you know, people in positions of authority within the schools or in the hospitals or in the doctor's office or the therapist.
[01:43:46.848 --> 01:43:52.311]  And, you know, so the, the, basically they have built a society that is based on deception
[01:43:52.791 --> 01:43:53.952]  We're good to go.
[01:44:10.330 --> 01:44:10.831]  I agree.
[01:44:11.251 --> 01:44:11.811]  He's a focal point.
[01:44:31.468 --> 01:44:33.790]  If they would have killed him, it would have been worse for them, actually.
[01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:36.272]  I'm glad they didn't kill him, but de-war game that.
[01:44:36.633 --> 01:44:38.995]  They're not even thinking second, third order.
[01:44:39.015 --> 01:44:40.296]  They're thinking immediacy.
[01:44:40.316 --> 01:44:42.298]  I think they're going to try again, Laura Logan.
[01:44:42.318 --> 01:44:42.678]  What do you think?
[01:44:43.857 --> 01:44:47.518]  Well, I mean, the Secret Service has said they think they're going to try again, right?
[01:44:47.558 --> 01:44:50.519]  I mean, a lot of very informed people are saying they're going to try again.
[01:44:50.559 --> 01:44:51.559]  It certainly makes sense.
[01:44:51.739 --> 01:44:53.900]  I mean, they're terrified of Trump.
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:56.081]  They're absolutely terrified of him.
[01:44:56.641 --> 01:44:58.521]  And he's not afraid of them anymore.
[01:44:58.541 --> 01:45:00.022]  And I know him well, you know him well.
[01:45:00.282 --> 01:45:01.382]  It's because he's real.
[01:45:01.422 --> 01:45:03.183]  He makes mistakes, but he is the guy.
[01:45:03.523 --> 01:45:05.523]  With Donald Trump, nobody's telling him what to do.
[01:45:05.824 --> 01:45:06.864]  You know, I've met Trump.
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:07.921]  You've never met him?
[01:45:08.121 --> 01:45:09.044]  I've never met him.
[01:45:09.124 --> 01:45:11.289]  I saw photos of you in Mar-a-Lago, maybe they were fake or whatever.
[01:45:11.389 --> 01:45:13.855]  I know, I've been to Mar-a-Lago, but I never met Trump.
[01:45:14.256 --> 01:45:16.280]  No, Trump is behind the scenes, like...
[01:45:17.651 --> 01:45:18.192]  We're good to go.
[01:45:39.770 --> 01:45:42.194]  Most popular president since George Washington was Nixon other than Trump.
[01:45:42.495 --> 01:45:45.119]  So it's Nixon, Trump, Washington, the most popular ever in the numbers.
[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.664]  And all three of them were their own person, so.
[01:45:48.263 --> 01:45:49.103]  Alex, you know what's funny?
[01:45:49.424 --> 01:45:52.565]  You know how Trump drives them crazy because he speaks in hyperbole, right?
[01:45:53.105 --> 01:45:55.486]  He's the guy that went fishing and never caught a fish this size.
[01:45:55.526 --> 01:45:58.988]  He caught the fish this size, the most beautiful fish that anyone's ever caught.
[01:45:59.468 --> 01:46:07.371]  Well, I remember when he used to say in the beginning of his presidency that he was going to be one of the most consequential presidents in the history of the United States.
[01:46:07.812 --> 01:46:17.036]  Well, now you look at it and you realize, I mean, holy guacamole, not only is that true, but in some ways he may be the most
[01:46:18.236 --> 01:46:22.180]  I already told Trump, I said, you're at George Washington level, you're about to go past it.
[01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:25.443]  So, no, he's definitely the most important president since George Washington.
[01:46:25.603 --> 01:46:27.164]  Because this is it, right?
[01:46:27.364 --> 01:46:28.045]  I mean, this is it.
[01:46:28.105 --> 01:46:34.231]  Since the birth of this country, there has never been an election that was more consequential than this one.
[01:46:34.651 --> 01:46:37.113]  There has not been an election in our lifetimes.
[01:46:38.234 --> 01:46:41.896]  From the very beginning, there hasn't been an election that mattered as much as this.
[01:46:41.916 --> 01:46:44.398]  I mean, you are literally now in every direction.
[01:46:44.698 --> 01:46:50.641]  Tucker Carlson said recently, right, he said that the Fourth Amendment privacy is a prerequisite to freedom.
[01:46:51.242 --> 01:46:52.803]  Well, look where we are on privacy.
[01:46:53.403 --> 01:46:57.305]  You know, our privacy has been obliterated, so our freedom is being obliterated.
[01:46:57.846 --> 01:47:01.968]  And it's the promise of Trump I don't like that he might do the right thing because they don't control him.
[01:47:02.208 --> 01:47:02.608]  Oh no, no.
[01:47:02.729 --> 01:47:03.689]  It's not just a promise.
[01:47:04.230 --> 01:47:05.011]  I mean, they know.
[01:47:05.671 --> 01:47:12.618]  If Trump doesn't do the right thing this time, like if he's not definitive about what he does, he already knows they're coming for him.
[01:47:12.758 --> 01:47:13.539]  That's key.
[01:47:13.579 --> 01:47:15.661]  His survival is tied to doing the right thing now.
[01:47:16.644 --> 01:47:18.285]  Yes, without a doubt.
[01:47:18.565 --> 01:47:20.546]  And that's why Rasky would say, we're going to have a civil war.
[01:47:20.766 --> 01:47:24.848]  Did you see Biden say on CBS yesterday?
[01:47:25.368 --> 01:47:28.289]  Where he's like, oh, there won't be a peaceful transfer if he wins.
[01:47:28.329 --> 01:47:30.951]  He goes, oh, I mean, I mean, he's stay there.
[01:47:30.991 --> 01:47:32.791]  Back in two minutes, Laura Logan is on fire.
[01:47:33.112 --> 01:47:34.492]  Whole other hour with her.
[01:47:34.932 --> 01:47:36.553]  And then Drew Hernandez takes over.
[01:47:36.593 --> 01:47:39.194]  It's so good to have you here.
[01:47:39.254 --> 01:47:40.215]  It's a great honor.
[01:47:40.715 --> 01:47:41.415]  We'll be right back.
[01:47:41.435 --> 01:47:42.476]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:47:43.194 --> 01:47:50.696]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[01:47:51.316 --> 01:47:53.597]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[01:47:54.217 --> 01:48:00.738]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.
[01:48:00.758 --> 01:48:04.299]  And that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[01:48:04.779 --> 01:48:10.941]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,
[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:20.549]  Double down and support the broadcast more than ever to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:48:20.729 --> 01:48:29.819]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:31.381]  These are very, very popular.
[01:48:31.481 --> 01:48:32.462]  And I went looking up online.
[01:48:32.863 --> 01:48:33.784]  It is very, very popular.
[01:48:34.364 --> 01:48:36.104]  It's not an investment, it's a collectible.
[01:48:36.285 --> 01:48:43.206]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:48:43.646 --> 01:48:47.667]  Best group out there, highest ratings, amazing prices, the best.
[01:48:47.907 --> 01:48:51.968]  This is a collectible at a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[01:48:52.508 --> 01:49:00.230]  Then the bankruptcy started and the people that came in from the court said, we're not going to keep the outside people's products in here, in your store.
[01:49:01.331 --> 01:49:02.151]  And they kicked him back.
[01:49:03.286 --> 01:49:07.028]  Uh, to the folks, despite the fact we already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[01:49:07.328 --> 01:49:18.395]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[01:49:18.995 --> 01:49:27.402]  Infowars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[01:49:27.882 --> 01:49:33.186]  Stock up on 24 karat .999 pure gold in the most popular size of one-tenth grand.
[01:49:33.426 --> 01:49:38.130]  An affordable, sleek card that fits your wallet, drawer, glove compartment, and is easy to travel with.
[01:49:38.530 --> 01:49:40.012]  They're amazing cards.
[01:49:40.372 --> 01:49:42.193]  It's got original art I came up with.
[01:49:42.273 --> 01:49:42.874]  It's got the little
[01:49:43.494 --> 01:49:44.695]  Bar of gold in there.
[01:49:45.176 --> 01:49:47.818]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Infowar.
[01:49:48.118 --> 01:49:54.163]  You'll have a historical memento as a keepsake for yourself, your family, for your children, and your grandchildren.
[01:49:54.183 --> 01:49:55.825]  Because this is a historic fight.
[01:49:56.225 --> 01:50:00.048]  And this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[01:50:00.408 --> 01:50:01.710]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[01:50:02.370 --> 01:50:05.252]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[01:50:05.832 --> 01:50:08.814]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[01:50:09.195 --> 01:50:14.038]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[01:50:14.418 --> 01:50:16.520]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:23.284]  We've only got a few thousand of these left, and I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[01:50:23.304 --> 01:50:23.925]  Now, I want to be clear.
[01:50:24.485 --> 01:50:26.666]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[01:50:26.686 --> 01:50:27.467]  That's not what this is.
[01:50:27.487 --> 01:50:28.528]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[01:50:29.128 --> 01:50:42.220]  This is like, on NPR, if it still gets taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug to cost them $5, or a baseball cap to cost them $10, and you make a $100 donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the New World Order.
[01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:43.441]  I know you don't want to do that.
[01:50:44.162 --> 01:50:48.966]  This costs, I think they told me, more than $10 per card, something like that, $10 or $11, and so the other
[01:50:51.578 --> 01:50:54.520]  80-something dollars will go to fund the operation.
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:57.683]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[01:50:58.223 --> 01:51:05.909]  So, get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[01:51:06.290 --> 01:51:07.371]  The decision is yours.
[01:51:07.391 --> 01:51:08.812]  This is a limited edition.
[01:51:09.452 --> 01:51:13.776]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[01:51:14.456 --> 01:51:24.764]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, and myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[01:51:25.124 --> 01:51:34.031]  So please take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars limited edition proprietary 24 karat 999 pure gold collectible.
[01:51:34.411 --> 01:51:35.292]  Thank you for your support.
[01:51:35.632 --> 01:51:37.294]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[01:51:49.918 --> 01:51:53.401]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:52:22.481 --> 01:52:29.986]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[01:52:30.626 --> 01:52:32.887]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[01:52:33.508 --> 01:52:40.032]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.

[01:52:44.054 --> 01:52:50.238]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,

[01:53:09.503 --> 01:53:10.743]  These are very, very popular.
[01:53:10.783 --> 01:53:13.404]  Now, when we looked it up online, it is very, very popular.
[01:53:13.644 --> 01:53:15.384]  It's not an investment, it's a collectible.
[01:53:15.584 --> 01:53:18.645]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's
[01:53:19.065 --> 01:53:22.487]  Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.

[01:53:27.189 --> 01:53:31.251]  This is a collectible and a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[01:53:31.791 --> 01:53:33.092]  Then the bankruptcy started.
[01:53:33.732 --> 01:53:39.515]  And the people that came in from the court said, we're not going to keep outside people's products in here, in your store.

[01:54:17.816 --> 01:54:19.296]  They're amazing cards.
[01:54:19.657 --> 01:54:21.477]  It's got original art I came up with.
[01:54:21.557 --> 01:54:23.918]  It's got the little bar of gold in there.
[01:54:24.458 --> 01:54:27.101]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Infowar.
[01:54:27.421 --> 01:54:33.447]  You'll have a historical memento as a keepsake for yourself, for your family, for your children, and your grandchildren.
[01:54:33.467 --> 01:54:35.108]  Because this is a historic fight.
[01:54:35.488 --> 01:54:39.332]  And this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[01:54:39.692 --> 01:54:40.994]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[01:54:41.654 --> 01:54:44.536]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[01:54:45.117 --> 01:54:48.119]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:53.323]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[01:54:53.704 --> 01:54:55.805]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[01:54:56.606 --> 01:55:02.591]  We've only got a few thousand of these left, and I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[01:55:02.671 --> 01:55:03.211]  I want to be clear.
[01:55:03.772 --> 01:55:05.953]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[01:55:05.973 --> 01:55:06.774]  That's not what this is.
[01:55:06.794 --> 01:55:07.795]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[01:55:08.405 --> 01:55:21.508]  This is like on NPR, if it still gets taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug that costs them $5 or a baseball cap that costs them $10 and you make a $100 donation and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the new world order.
[01:55:21.788 --> 01:55:22.708]  I know you don't want to do that.
[01:55:23.428 --> 01:55:27.849]  This costs, I think they told me, more than $10 per card, something like that, $10 or $11.
[01:55:27.929 --> 01:55:28.250]  And so the other
[01:55:30.845 --> 01:55:33.808]  80-something dollars will go to fund the operation.
[01:55:33.848 --> 01:55:36.991]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[01:55:37.511 --> 01:55:45.199]  So, get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[01:55:45.559 --> 01:55:46.660]  The decision is yours.
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:48.082]  This is a limited edition.
[01:55:48.722 --> 01:55:53.045]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[01:55:53.745 --> 01:56:04.011]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, and myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.

[01:56:36.098 --> 01:56:39.262]  We're coming back with Laura Logan and T-Minus 60 Seconds.
[01:56:39.983 --> 01:56:50.215]  Well, Laura Logan is an amazing pundit and analyst, but she's really known for being a top journalist and investigative journalist and wartime correspondent and combat journalist.
[01:56:50.796 --> 01:56:52.217]  And she's been working on this a long time.
[01:56:52.237 --> 01:56:53.899]  She wants to break this today.
[01:56:54.580 --> 01:56:58.642]  And this tie, it sends chills up my spine to all the sleeper networks in the U.S.
[01:56:58.702 --> 01:57:02.644]  from Iran, from the Palestinians, Hamas, Hezbollah, all of it.
[01:57:02.984 --> 01:57:06.346]  What really happened in Afghanistan, why Biden pulled out of there.
[01:57:06.706 --> 01:57:07.787]  She's got the numbers here.
[01:57:07.827 --> 01:57:12.589]  This is major breaking news happening right now with the award-winning top journalist, Laura Logan.
[01:57:12.869 --> 01:57:13.830]  Laura, tell us what's happening.
[01:57:14.642 --> 01:57:27.106]  So, Alex, one of the things I've been investigating is, was reported to me by Dr. Keith Rose, who was a clandestine operative, intelligence operative for the U.S.
[01:57:27.126 --> 01:57:28.686]  government for more than three decades.
[01:57:29.407 --> 01:57:33.828]  And he has now, I mean, this is a guy who stayed in the shadows, right?
[01:57:34.148 --> 01:57:36.369]  He spent many, many years in Afghanistan.
[01:57:36.449 --> 01:57:37.989]  I have known him for a number of years.
[01:57:38.949 --> 01:57:43.271]  And he has come forward now to report on something that
[01:57:44.031 --> 01:57:50.576]  He has already submitted to central reporting, which in the intelligence world means it's gone into the system.
[01:57:50.616 --> 01:57:52.037]  To all 17 agencies.
[01:57:52.357 --> 01:57:53.018]  That's correct.
[01:57:53.278 --> 01:57:57.481]  So there's no way that anyone can say that this is a surprise or they can say they don't know about it, right?
[01:57:57.901 --> 01:58:08.589]  And what they are reporting is that some 70,000 terrorists graduated this year from terrorist training centers attached to the madrasas.
[01:58:09.190 --> 01:58:11.752]  Madrasas are those religious schools attached to mosques.
[01:58:11.772 --> 01:58:13.053]  While our borders are wide open.
[01:58:13.433 --> 01:58:22.423]  While our borders are wide open, Afghanistan has turned into basically a terrorist state on a scale that the world has never ever seen before.
[01:58:22.543 --> 01:58:25.607]  So just like they use it against the Soviets and then use it against America?
[01:58:25.627 --> 01:58:27.189]  No, this is nothing like that.
[01:58:27.549 --> 01:58:30.713]  This is what they did against the Soviets on a nuclear scale.
[01:58:31.013 --> 01:58:41.000]  This is 70,000 jihadis who graduated from terrorist training centers at the madrasas at these mosques in Afghanistan just this year.
[01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:45.223]  So we know Obama on a smaller scale of 20,000 attacked the Middle East with.
[01:58:46.431 --> 01:58:47.272]  I don't know about that.
[01:58:47.952 --> 01:58:48.873]  Remember Syria?
[01:58:49.994 --> 01:58:50.834]  Yes, yes.
[01:58:50.894 --> 01:58:54.637]  There were certainly some there, but this, Alex, is something completely different.
[01:58:54.657 --> 01:58:55.298]  A whole nother level.
[01:58:55.358 --> 01:58:56.599]  This is a whole nother level.
[01:58:56.619 --> 01:59:06.166]  This is after we handed Afghanistan over to al-Qaeda and the Taliban, who are working together in Afghanistan, and the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, moved in.
[01:59:06.186 --> 01:59:08.688]  By the way, I'm going to show up and give you the floor.
[01:59:08.788 --> 01:59:09.569]  I want to be clear.
[01:59:09.949 --> 01:59:12.451]  I'm just saying there's precedent for this before on a smaller scale.
[01:59:12.631 --> 01:59:12.972]  Oh yeah.
[01:59:13.092 --> 01:59:15.215]  And so this is kind of the shadow army the globalists are using.
[01:59:15.255 --> 01:59:18.079]  Like you said, radical Islam is just one arm of the globalists.
[01:59:18.099 --> 01:59:20.041]  So I just wanted to say you're right about that.
[01:59:20.442 --> 01:59:24.027]  We wonder why they pulled out, why they gave them $87 million of weapons.
[01:59:24.548 --> 01:59:26.430]  You've got the resources, the insiders.
[01:59:26.711 --> 01:59:28.133]  You're about to tell us what this is really all about.
[01:59:28.473 --> 01:59:29.814]  Oh yeah, because it's much worse than that.
[01:59:29.834 --> 01:59:32.615]  They didn't just leave behind $80 billion in weapons.
[01:59:32.675 --> 01:59:37.777]  They left behind the biometric capability that the NSA uses.
[01:59:38.097 --> 01:59:40.959]  They left behind the people trained in using those systems.
[01:59:41.339 --> 01:59:43.620]  They left behind access to those systems.
[01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:56.846]  So not only do you have tens of thousands of Afghans being trained inside these religious schools at the mosques, who are being trained in bomb making and small arms and all the rest of it, they are now able to issue them passports
[01:59:57.426 --> 01:59:58.888]  With altered biometrics.
[01:59:59.348 --> 02:00:02.932]  So they cannot be, they do not show up in the terrorist database.
[02:00:03.132 --> 02:00:03.412]  Wow.
[02:00:03.933 --> 02:00:05.394]  So they gave them cloaking power?
[02:00:05.875 --> 02:00:06.215]  Yes.
[02:00:06.496 --> 02:00:06.976]  Wow.
[02:00:07.296 --> 02:00:07.617]  Yes.
[02:00:07.817 --> 02:00:10.780]  Wow, so Afghan terrorists give NSA cloaking.
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:12.742]  That's spy-level stuff.
[02:00:13.203 --> 02:00:14.544]  The State Department did it.
[02:00:14.964 --> 02:00:17.307]  The intelligence agencies did it.
[02:00:17.667 --> 02:00:19.890]  I mean, there is... But that alone is bombshell.
[02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:20.800]  Yep.
[02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:25.822]  Cloaking new identity technology given by Biden to Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:00:26.102 --> 02:00:28.903]  Yes, and this doesn't just come from, you know, U.S.
[02:00:28.943 --> 02:00:29.683]  intelligence sources.
[02:00:29.703 --> 02:00:32.464]  This also comes from Afghan intelligence sources.
[02:00:32.844 --> 02:00:38.265]  This is what they've literally, I mean, you can be a known Afghan terrorist, have altered your biometrics.
[02:00:38.606 --> 02:00:42.427]  You can either cross the southern border or you can fly in to an American airport.
[02:00:42.547 --> 02:00:44.267]  Oh, by the way, to a European airport.
[02:00:44.627 --> 02:00:49.529]  I mean, Afghanistan has become the terrorist training center for the entire world.
[02:00:50.129 --> 02:00:54.130]  And I know that this is not a theoretical conversation.
[02:00:54.470 --> 02:01:08.073]  I have been tracking this now for the last couple of years, and I know that in the last couple of months, there's been, you know, numerous times that the intelligence community has been warned about what is happening in Afghanistan.
[02:01:08.133 --> 02:01:12.353]  And the FBI director says we've never seen somebody flashing red lights, so uninterrupted like five times.
[02:01:12.433 --> 02:01:14.654]  Start over at the beginning and go through it all.
[02:01:15.074 --> 02:01:19.835]  Well, here's I think a lot of people will remember that when the U.S.
[02:01:19.975 --> 02:01:27.936]  was pulling out of Afghanistan for some inexplicable reason, we agreed to a timeline that was set really by our terrorist enemies.
[02:01:28.536 --> 02:01:35.498]  And it made no sense because there wasn't anyone in the United States saying the Biden administration has to be out by this time or else.
[02:01:36.098 --> 02:01:42.519]  And so in the midst of this chaos, right, remember the scenes of Afghans who were terrified, desperately clinging
[02:01:42.879 --> 02:01:43.299]  Thank you so much.
[02:02:06.616 --> 02:02:07.197]  We're good to go.
[02:02:27.278 --> 02:02:44.555]  Until today, when Dr. Keith Rose was talking to me on Bannon's show, I was hosting, guest hosting for Bannon because he's on day 39 in prison and this is my way to show support and to stand up for the First Amendment and to stand up for Steve Bannon because nobody should be, he should not be in jail.
[02:02:44.996 --> 02:02:48.779]  So when Dr. Keith Rose came forward, he said, what has come to light now
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:03:04.771]  From people who were involved and who witnessed this firsthand, is that Nicholas Burns, not only did he meet with Siraj Akhani, he also met with two representatives, intelligence operatives for the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, at that same meeting.
[02:03:05.111 --> 02:03:15.279]  There was also someone, President, representing the Pakistani Intelligence Services, and a very significant intelligence operative for the Iranian IRGC, the Quds Force.
[02:03:15.859 --> 02:03:17.600]  Okay, who was well-known to U.S.
[02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:20.503]  intelligence agencies for his work in Iraq.
[02:03:21.583 --> 02:03:36.254]  And no one has yet come forward to explain what exactly, why exactly was the head of the CIA meeting off-site with Tier 1 security at this, basically, what is a gathering of America's enemies.
[02:03:36.695 --> 02:03:40.598]  A Legion of Doom meeting, obviously, getting ready to hand the chat comms.
[02:03:43.121 --> 02:03:46.823]  Yeah, and look at where we are today.
[02:03:47.183 --> 02:03:56.069]  We have hundreds of thousands of Chinese that have crossed the southern border illegally, many of them military-aged males, numbers that we have never seen in the history of this country.
[02:03:56.829 --> 02:04:01.412]  We have the Chinese Communist Party working very closely with the Afghans.
[02:04:01.712 --> 02:04:07.556]  They have access to the rare earth minerals inside Afghanistan that are used in electronics, you know, all over the world.
[02:04:07.956 --> 02:04:11.078]  They have backed the Afghans with unprecedented amounts of money.
[02:04:11.118 --> 02:04:17.181]  Afghanistan is the center of the global chessboard, according to Brzezinski's view, which is adopted by the CIA.
[02:04:17.541 --> 02:04:19.501]  And guess what, Alex, you're going to love this, okay?
[02:04:19.942 --> 02:04:24.263]  Not only have the Chinese partnered with the Afghans in creating this terrorist state, right?
[02:04:24.504 --> 02:04:26.765]  That our tax dollars are still funding, by the way.
[02:04:27.405 --> 02:04:34.788]  But the Chinese have now, for the first time in history, erected a border wall between Afghanistan and China.
[02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:44.791]  I mean, during the time of Alexander the Great, during the time of the Russians, during the time of Genghis Khan, during the time of the British, during the time even when the U.S.
[02:04:44.851 --> 02:04:47.935]  were present in Afghanistan, they did not have a border.
[02:04:47.955 --> 02:04:48.936]  So what do they know is coming?
[02:04:49.377 --> 02:04:50.418]  What's the extrapolation?
[02:04:50.879 --> 02:04:54.942]  The terrorists that they have helped to create, they're making sure they can keep them out of China.
[02:04:55.382 --> 02:04:57.644]  They don't want that threat coming into their garden, right?
[02:04:58.224 --> 02:05:02.627]  They don't want that snake making its way into their own garden, but they're happy to see- So, exactly.
[02:05:02.647 --> 02:05:04.929]  So they're building this giant, unprecedented army.
[02:05:05.269 --> 02:05:06.290]  Who are they planning to point it at?
[02:05:06.946 --> 02:05:18.333]  Well, you know, it's no secret, according to two Chinese colonels, they wrote the book on unrestricted warfare, which was, you know, that's exactly what they've been using against the United States.
[02:05:18.694 --> 02:05:20.215]  And they're going after the U.S.
[02:05:20.495 --> 02:05:23.357]  I mean, we are so used to traditional forms of war.
[02:05:23.737 --> 02:05:28.040]  We think if we don't see tanks rolling down the streets or bombs falling from the sky... We're not ready for asymmetrical.
[02:05:28.100 --> 02:05:29.761]  We think we're not at war, but we are.
[02:05:29.781 --> 02:05:31.402]  And we have been at war.
[02:05:31.422 --> 02:05:32.362]  This is an undeclared war.
[02:05:32.382 --> 02:05:35.685]  Open borders, fentanyl, transgenderism, devaluing the dollar.
[02:05:36.945 --> 02:05:40.566]  We're under globalist attack, and they're going to use Islam as one of their key weapons.
[02:05:40.926 --> 02:05:43.606]  This is an undeclared war, and it's a war for your mind.
[02:05:44.207 --> 02:05:52.168]  You know, I mean, that's why the digital space, that's why information and press freedom and privacy, that's why these things matter so much.
[02:05:52.548 --> 02:05:58.750]  Those are, I mean, those are the walls that are standing, right, between us, and that's it.
[02:05:59.190 --> 02:06:00.430]  Once those walls fall,
[02:06:01.030 --> 02:06:05.153]  I mean, then it's really uncertain that this is reversible.
[02:06:05.213 --> 02:06:10.156]  We don't have an open-ended window to address this.
[02:06:10.676 --> 02:06:11.596]  We really don't.
[02:06:11.636 --> 02:06:12.577]  Let me ask you this then.
[02:06:12.657 --> 02:06:14.678]  We have Israel standing down on October 7th.
[02:06:15.179 --> 02:06:17.960]  We have Biden giving $6 billion to Iran before.
[02:06:18.401 --> 02:06:19.661]  Clearly there's some back channel.
[02:06:20.302 --> 02:06:23.524]  In the globalist system, who do you think's on whose side?
[02:06:23.584 --> 02:06:24.384]  What's their endgame?
[02:06:24.404 --> 02:06:25.985]  What do you think they're planning with a 70,000 army?
[02:06:28.328 --> 02:06:42.783]  I think it's obvious, Alex, that, you know, today, if you talk about the United States, you have to make a distinction whether you're talking about the domestic enemies of this country, the globalists, who really, they may be American, but only in name, right?
[02:06:43.044 --> 02:06:45.066]  And it's the same when you talk about other countries.
[02:06:45.586 --> 02:06:49.771]  I mean, because although you say, you know, Israel stood down, but not all of Israel stood down, right?
[02:06:50.051 --> 02:06:51.131]  No, no, the central government.
[02:06:51.211 --> 02:06:52.111]  Obviously, we don't blame Israel.
[02:06:52.151 --> 02:06:57.733]  What I'm saying is there's a larger, you see Iran and the West working together at some sick level.
[02:06:58.313 --> 02:06:59.293]  What's the backroom deal?
[02:06:59.333 --> 02:07:02.534]  Why did Biden give them Afghanistan, the 80 plus billion of weapons?
[02:07:03.114 --> 02:07:05.674]  I'm saying, what are they setting up?
[02:07:05.754 --> 02:07:07.014]  What do you think the end game is?
[02:07:07.935 --> 02:07:10.255]  They have the outcome they want, right?
[02:07:10.675 --> 02:07:15.196]  I mean, if you didn't want a terrorist state in Afghanistan, you wouldn't have done what you did.
[02:07:15.216 --> 02:07:19.617]  Yeah, you spent 21 years there and then handed over to the Taliban with 80 billion bucks.
[02:07:20.191 --> 02:07:20.591]  And more.
[02:07:20.932 --> 02:07:21.652]  We did much more.
[02:07:21.692 --> 02:07:23.774]  Look, we left behind clandestine capabilities.
[02:07:24.035 --> 02:07:25.876]  We left behind clandestine operatives.
[02:07:26.317 --> 02:07:32.362]  I mean, you know, all kinds of things that haven't even been exposed or admitted to, right?
[02:07:32.542 --> 02:07:42.171]  There were clandestine and significant surveillance assets in aircraft that made it across the border to another country that the U.S.
[02:07:42.251 --> 02:07:43.212]  agreed to give back.
[02:07:43.732 --> 02:07:49.996]  It was illegal to even move those assets across that border back into Afghanistan and put them in the hands of terrorists.
[02:07:50.316 --> 02:07:51.377]  But they did it anyway.
[02:07:51.737 --> 02:07:53.098]  And nobody had a gun to their head.
[02:07:53.538 --> 02:07:54.659]  They chose to do that.
[02:07:55.099 --> 02:07:58.041]  And they did it in violation, actually, of U.S.
[02:07:58.101 --> 02:07:58.341]  law.
[02:07:58.701 --> 02:08:01.403]  So, I mean, you know... No, I know that's all on record.
[02:08:01.423 --> 02:08:02.824]  You've exposed more stuff today, so...
[02:08:03.704 --> 02:08:05.507]  We don't have to guess.
[02:08:05.968 --> 02:08:07.650]  We don't have to guess at what the plan is.
[02:08:07.991 --> 02:08:08.892]  We just have to listen.
[02:08:09.293 --> 02:08:10.815]  We have to listen to what they tell us.
[02:08:11.376 --> 02:08:13.479]  I mean, it's very, very clear.
[02:08:14.861 --> 02:08:18.787]  When this administration put open border ideologues in
[02:08:19.768 --> 02:08:26.692]  On their staff, when they gave them control over the immigration policy of this country in violation of U.S.
[02:08:26.752 --> 02:08:32.635]  law and bypassed Congress and bypassed the American people, they let you know what their policy was.
[02:08:33.055 --> 02:08:36.937]  So they created a radical Islamic army over the border, then what do they do next?
[02:08:38.318 --> 02:08:40.939]  Well, they're backed by the Chinese.
[02:08:41.419 --> 02:08:43.900]  So, I mean, we've never seen anything like this, right?
[02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:46.882]  So unlike Red Dawn where Russians parachute in and they're going to use Islamists?
[02:08:48.785 --> 02:08:53.450]  You know, this is what a number of intelligence operatives that I have spoken to over the last few years believe.
[02:08:53.470 --> 02:08:56.773]  They believe that the cartel are the army of the deep state.
[02:08:57.734 --> 02:08:59.836]  Well, you know the CIA's run the cartels for 40 years.
[02:09:00.782 --> 02:09:04.224]  Well, this is what you're looking at is an intelligence operation, right?
[02:09:04.584 --> 02:09:08.565]  I mean, everything about what you're looking at leads to an intelligence operation.
[02:09:08.906 --> 02:09:16.269]  Dr. Rose, he spelled that out, you know, in a very interesting way, because I look at it in information terms because I'm a journalist.
[02:09:16.309 --> 02:09:19.970]  I look at the information war because this is obviously a battle for our minds.
[02:09:20.451 --> 02:09:27.374]  But it's easy to miss when you do that, that what you're really looking at is an intelligence operation.
[02:09:28.214 --> 02:09:32.538]  Right, that's what's being carried out, not just against Donald Trump, but against the American people.
[02:09:32.858 --> 02:09:34.600]  It's being carried out against the British people.
[02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:35.441]  And it's just like Obama.
[02:09:37.102 --> 02:09:43.028]  All the guns from Fast and Furious, it wasn't just to blame gun owners for violence in America, it was to be shipped to ISIS.
[02:09:44.389 --> 02:09:48.831]  Well, there's a lot more to that that has yet to be uncovered.
[02:09:48.851 --> 02:09:50.011]  No, I agree.
[02:09:50.031 --> 02:09:53.233]  So we think Fast and Furious, hundreds of thousands of guns was bad.
[02:09:53.553 --> 02:09:56.394]  This 80-something million is a thousand times bigger.
[02:09:56.634 --> 02:10:08.659]  Yeah, and Fast and Furious was very significant because that was the beginning of agencies within our government going beyond their legal charter and in violation of the law and getting away with it.
[02:10:08.979 --> 02:10:12.383]  You know, you see the same thing with the IRS under Lois Lerner, right?
[02:10:12.403 --> 02:10:13.004]  Sure.
[02:10:13.144 --> 02:10:23.756]  And one after another, what we saw under Obama that has been repeated ever since is agencies going beyond their legal charter and their authority to break the law and get away with it.
[02:10:24.196 --> 02:10:32.864]  And the other thing we saw that was introduced under Obama that has become prolific for radical progressives is abandoning your people.
[02:10:33.504 --> 02:10:34.645]  Abandoning your citizens.
[02:10:34.745 --> 02:10:35.866]  They did it in Benghazi.
[02:10:36.227 --> 02:10:37.828]  They did it in Afghanistan.
[02:10:38.108 --> 02:10:39.510]  They did it again in Gaza.
[02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:40.871]  And now with our veterans here.
[02:10:41.331 --> 02:10:42.772]  So, let's extrapolate.
[02:10:43.673 --> 02:10:47.774]  80 plus billion in weapons, training 70,000, open borders.
[02:10:47.794 --> 02:10:49.715]  They're clearly planning some type of attack.
[02:10:50.095 --> 02:10:54.837]  They think we'll be so dumb when this attack happens, they'll pose as the saviors and take all of our rights.
[02:10:55.337 --> 02:11:03.199]  So, what I can say as a journalist, Alex, because I don't like to, you know, as you know, I hate to say I'm not a prophet, right?
[02:11:03.579 --> 02:11:06.160]  But what we can see is the building blocks.
[02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:08.741]  You see the staging operations, right?
[02:11:09.061 --> 02:11:11.822]  Build the army, give them the weapons, protect them, open the border.
[02:11:12.342 --> 02:11:13.443]  Trump asked for the 10,000 troops?
[02:11:13.484 --> 02:11:13.604]  No.
[02:11:27.159 --> 02:11:27.239]  Yes.
[02:11:57.599 --> 02:12:01.802]  Well, and most importantly, Alex, it's both sides of the political aisle.
[02:12:02.343 --> 02:12:06.826]  This is something that I cannot state more clearly.
[02:12:06.846 --> 02:12:07.286]  I agree.
[02:12:07.306 --> 02:12:08.987]  The Republican establishment is a big part of this.
[02:12:09.468 --> 02:12:11.929]  Because that's how they sell it to the country.
[02:12:12.230 --> 02:12:25.099]  I mean, you'll find that there's a lot of people who identify as Republicans and conservatives who are still hesitant to support, you know, just to address January 6th because their Republican leaders stood up and helped, you know,
[02:12:25.879 --> 02:12:28.480]  Push the lie from the very beginning, right?
[02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:30.541]  I mean, they have been part of pushing the lie.
[02:12:30.581 --> 02:12:33.483]  Look at look at what Fox News did with the 2020 election.
[02:12:33.843 --> 02:12:35.504]  I mean, this is the perfect example.
[02:12:35.844 --> 02:12:44.568]  They knew after 2016 that if you had all the same players saying that, you know, that Biden was going to win and Trump was going to lose, that people weren't going to buy it.
[02:12:44.588 --> 02:12:45.849]  They're going to say this is a replay of 2016.
[02:12:46.149 --> 02:12:49.030]  So what did they do with less than 10 percent of the vote counted?
[02:12:49.370 --> 02:12:52.572]  They had the you know, they had Fox News lead the charge.
[02:12:53.192 --> 02:12:58.494]  And in giving Arizona to Biden, it was impossible for them to know it at that point.
[02:12:58.895 --> 02:13:02.656]  And what happened is so many people is they folded, right?
[02:13:02.696 --> 02:13:03.977]  That nobody wanted to talk about.
[02:13:04.057 --> 02:13:04.557]  I totally agree.
[02:13:04.597 --> 02:13:06.478]  So what do you see them pulling this time?
[02:13:08.079 --> 02:13:12.521]  Well, it remains to be seen whether there will still be an election, whether there will actually be an election.
[02:13:12.581 --> 02:13:13.541]  That is not a given.
[02:13:14.342 --> 02:13:19.164]  You know, when you when it when a dangerous animal is cornered,
[02:13:20.154 --> 02:13:22.715]  They will do anything to survive.
[02:13:22.815 --> 02:13:26.297]  They will fight in any way possible for their life.
[02:13:26.777 --> 02:13:28.918]  And that's, I think, where we stand at this point.
[02:13:29.198 --> 02:13:34.180]  The one thing that these people fear more than anything else is accountability, right?
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:37.982]  Because accountability happens because the people want accountability.
[02:13:38.542 --> 02:13:40.843]  And if the people get it, it's over for them.
[02:13:41.363 --> 02:13:43.084]  So they're fighting for their survival.
[02:13:43.104 --> 02:13:49.926]  And when you have that animal that's cornered, you can see they're cornered because Trump has never been more popular than he is right now.
[02:13:50.426 --> 02:13:52.747]  People have never been more fed up than they are right now.
[02:13:53.067 --> 02:13:54.908]  They're more outspoken than they've ever been.
[02:13:54.948 --> 02:13:57.049]  They're more united than they've ever been.
[02:13:57.309 --> 02:14:02.011]  They're watching this play out all over the world and they're realizing, wait, this is real.
[02:14:02.431 --> 02:14:06.332]  And if we don't do something now, then we may not ever have the confidence again.
[02:14:06.352 --> 02:14:07.313]  So the globals were smart.
[02:14:08.573 --> 02:14:10.774]  Give up and go back in the shadows and try again.
[02:14:10.834 --> 02:14:12.255]  But I don't think they're going to do that.
[02:14:12.275 --> 02:14:12.775]  They can't.
[02:14:13.556 --> 02:14:14.776]  I think that ship has sailed.
[02:14:15.377 --> 02:14:16.897]  It's not available to them anymore.
[02:14:17.118 --> 02:14:22.360]  Because, I mean, I don't think that anyone's going to just ride in on a white horse and fix everything.
[02:14:22.721 --> 02:14:28.664]  But at the same time, it's obvious that there are people fighting behind the scenes because... And I agree with you, but...
[02:14:29.364 --> 02:14:31.765]  They knew Trump was going to win despite election fraud, so they tried to kill him.
[02:14:31.825 --> 02:14:32.786]  Now he got even stronger.
[02:14:32.806 --> 02:14:35.987]  Now the impetus to kill him is even stronger.
[02:14:36.408 --> 02:14:40.750]  Yes, but also, I mean, these people have been doing this for a very long time, Alex.
[02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:42.191]  So they already have a plan.
[02:14:42.451 --> 02:14:50.855]  If they can't prevent Trump from getting the White House, you can be sure they have a plan for what to take the House and take the Senate and, you know, and have him impeached.
[02:14:51.555 --> 02:14:54.558]  That's what Raskin said he would do.
[02:14:54.799 --> 02:14:56.480]  He said civil war.
[02:14:57.001 --> 02:15:01.145]  They have multiple lines of operation going at the same time.
[02:15:01.485 --> 02:15:02.647]  And they have multiple plans.
[02:15:02.687 --> 02:15:04.589]  If you don't think that, then you're an idiot.
[02:15:05.449 --> 02:15:06.070]  No, I agree with you.
[02:15:06.090 --> 02:15:07.451]  The good news is we're aware of it now.
[02:15:08.268 --> 02:15:08.628]  That is.
[02:15:08.868 --> 02:15:09.729]  That's a big part of it.
[02:15:09.789 --> 02:15:20.013]  Because although, you know, the Republican Party and the GOP, they've been dismal in doing anything significant about election integrity and fraud.
[02:15:20.373 --> 02:15:23.135]  But at the same time, the people are more aware.
[02:15:23.335 --> 02:15:24.855]  And that's got to count for something.
[02:15:24.875 --> 02:15:25.235]  I agree.
[02:15:25.275 --> 02:15:26.296]  And Trump's speaking live right now.
[02:15:26.316 --> 02:15:26.976]  We'll play it later.
[02:15:27.016 --> 02:15:28.677]  But are we not proud of Trump?
[02:15:28.717 --> 02:15:29.277]  He's not perfect.
[02:15:29.317 --> 02:15:30.538]  But my God, what a specimen.
[02:15:30.838 --> 02:15:31.918]  This guy is so strong.
[02:15:31.998 --> 02:15:32.779]  What do you think of Trump?
[02:15:33.039 --> 02:15:35.360]  Laura Logan, your real assessment of this guy?
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:41.165]  I think it's very interesting that he has never looked more at ease and more relaxed in the public eye.
[02:15:41.245 --> 02:15:43.167]  I mean, you know, he got a lot of flack.
[02:15:43.728 --> 02:15:48.212]  They call him the R in Jesus and what the Clementine deity and all the rest of it.
[02:15:48.552 --> 02:15:54.358]  But his days of looking like he just stepped out of a tanning salon and being kind of, you know, I mean, those days are gone.
[02:15:54.778 --> 02:15:57.101]  I mean, Trump is really he's really sort of.
[02:15:58.542 --> 02:16:01.084]  He's ready to come into his own at this moment.
[02:16:01.164 --> 02:16:05.829]  And if you think about it, I mean, for me, I didn't take, I'll be honest, I didn't take Trump seriously.
[02:16:06.269 --> 02:16:10.793]  In 2016, my dad called me from South Africa, and he's like, what the hell's going on over there in America?
[02:16:11.173 --> 02:16:13.135]  And I said, Dad, don't be ridiculous.
[02:16:13.235 --> 02:16:18.460]  You know, I was affected by the media coverage, and I didn't think that he was really serious.
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:20.142]  I didn't know a lot about Donald Trump.
[02:16:20.182 --> 02:16:21.323]  Well, I felt a tremor in the force.
[02:16:21.343 --> 02:16:22.063]  That's why I backed him.
[02:16:23.004 --> 02:16:35.971]  I didn't realize, but over time, Alex, he has earned my respect because I don't think there's any one individual that has been more attacked by the media, by the political establishment, in both parties.
[02:16:35.991 --> 02:16:37.011]  And it's not fake, it's real.
[02:16:37.151 --> 02:16:38.612]  By the intelligence agencies.
[02:16:38.892 --> 02:16:43.014]  I mean, they've tried to bankrupt him, cripple him financially, they've gone after his family.
[02:16:43.374 --> 02:16:44.275]  I mean, there's nothing.
[02:16:44.315 --> 02:16:46.456]  So, I mean, we've never seen a person
[02:16:47.416 --> 02:16:53.340]  The degree of strength of character and integrity and courage that it takes to stand up to that.
[02:16:53.420 --> 02:16:54.701]  And what about the shooting?
[02:16:55.062 --> 02:16:55.902]  You can't fake that.
[02:16:55.942 --> 02:16:57.783]  Graze him, he pops back up, fight by fight.
[02:16:58.104 --> 02:17:00.866]  That was so, like, that was amazing.
[02:17:01.146 --> 02:17:02.367]  That was amazing.
[02:17:03.107 --> 02:17:03.988]  That was amazing.
[02:17:04.308 --> 02:17:05.569]  Yeah, I mean, it was unbelievable.
[02:17:05.789 --> 02:17:06.970]  What would have happened if they had killed him?
[02:17:08.177 --> 02:17:10.539]  Well, I mean, to a degree that's unknowable, right?
[02:17:10.599 --> 02:17:15.482]  Because we have to speculate, but I can I can only speak for myself.
[02:17:17.423 --> 02:17:20.165]  I think there are two things that would have happened.
[02:17:20.405 --> 02:17:31.413]  One is that it would have taken the heart and soul out of many in this country because the scale of what we're up against is just can feel overwhelming at times.
[02:17:31.973 --> 02:17:37.537]  But on the other side of that, it would have ignited a fire of rage.
[02:17:38.938 --> 02:17:43.764]  I cannot imagine that the people would have taken that lying down.
[02:17:45.137 --> 02:17:46.238]  And the globalists know that.
[02:17:46.278 --> 02:17:48.319]  We would get violent, then they would bring in martial law.
[02:17:48.379 --> 02:17:49.260]  Oh, it only helps them.
[02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:49.880]  Yeah.
[02:17:50.141 --> 02:17:51.322]  It plays right into their hands.
[02:17:51.702 --> 02:17:54.204]  And, you know, I mean, I've heard people talking about things.
[02:17:54.244 --> 02:17:59.447]  I think Glenn Beck was hinting at this, right, that we're not in the clear yet.
[02:17:59.948 --> 02:18:08.114]  There's been so many red flag operations that they have tried to get away with and that have been basically failed, right, because people are more aware.
[02:18:08.514 --> 02:18:12.277]  But, you know, when you look at the Kamala Harris-Tim Waltz
[02:18:12.797 --> 02:18:13.197]  Tickets?
[02:18:13.518 --> 02:18:15.219]  That seems like an unwinnable ticket.
[02:18:15.559 --> 02:18:21.224]  I mean, in any election, let alone this one, where it definitely has no chance of defeating Trump.
[02:18:21.284 --> 02:18:22.605]  There's an arrogance to it.
[02:18:23.326 --> 02:18:24.927]  But is there something else to it?
[02:18:25.188 --> 02:18:34.756]  I mean, because if the Secret Service is in such bad shape, which it obviously is right now, what's to say that there wouldn't be an attempt on Kamala Harris?
[02:18:34.876 --> 02:18:35.336]  I agree.
[02:18:35.536 --> 02:18:35.796]  You know?
[02:18:36.317 --> 02:18:38.959]  And that could easily be blamed on Trump supporting me.
[02:18:38.999 --> 02:18:39.800]  I've been saying that.
[02:18:40.340 --> 02:18:45.645]  I think that's one of their big moves to kill Harris or the pervert guy.
[02:18:45.665 --> 02:18:49.668]  The pervert guy?
[02:18:50.930 --> 02:18:52.371]  Mr. Tampon, whatever you call him.
[02:18:52.451 --> 02:18:53.472]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:53.872 --> 02:18:55.914]  Yeah, that guy's got serious creep factor.
[02:18:56.234 --> 02:18:56.995]  It's creepy.
[02:18:57.636 --> 02:18:59.797]  Wait, but wait, isn't that their talking point?
[02:19:00.318 --> 02:19:01.399]  Republicans are weird?
[02:19:02.059 --> 02:19:05.182]  Is that because they knew they were picking a creepy guy and they had to project?
[02:19:05.522 --> 02:19:07.104]  That's an information warfare tactic.
[02:19:07.304 --> 02:19:09.927]  Well, I don't have gaydar, but I've watched the pedophiles.
[02:19:09.987 --> 02:19:14.192]  I got pedo, pedo radar, and the pedo radar breaks walls.
[02:19:14.652 --> 02:19:15.213]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:15.754 --> 02:19:18.757]  Many years ago, I coined the term 360 win.
[02:19:19.218 --> 02:19:21.861]  That's another way of saying it's a non-zero-sum game.
[02:19:22.261 --> 02:19:26.985]  When you have some game, it's a pizza, there's only so many pieces, it doesn't get bigger.
[02:19:27.405 --> 02:19:33.270]  But if something is symbiotic, if something empowers everybody involved with it, it is a 360 win.

[02:21:16.178 --> 02:21:19.499]  The enemy loves to delay me and take me away from my work, but guess what?
[02:21:20.159 --> 02:21:21.599]  The Lord works mysterious ways.
[02:21:22.400 --> 02:21:31.602]  Laura Logan tomorrow will host the first two hours, then the great Owen Schroyer will host the next two hours of my Friday transmission, and I won't let them take me away from the fight.
[02:21:32.102 --> 02:21:40.504]  I'll return Saturday with a special live four-hour broadcast to defeat the enemy, and then Sunday I'll return for a four-hour transmission as well.

[02:21:44.509 --> 02:21:47.192]  And I salute and thank you all for sharing the articles, the videos, the reports.
[02:21:47.212 --> 02:21:48.454]  You're doing an amazing job.
[02:21:48.474 --> 02:21:54.863]  All right, Laura, you sent me the Border Patrol numbers of what's happening at the border and all this other key intel.
[02:21:54.883 --> 02:21:55.664]  So let's get into that right now.
[02:21:56.806 --> 02:22:02.569]  Yeah, so this is, um, the numbers that I've given you come from Border Patrol, uh, Customs and Border Patrol themselves, right?
[02:22:02.629 --> 02:22:10.774]  And if you take a look at it, in 2017 there were 2,683 Venezuelans that were apprehended crossing the border illegally.
[02:22:11.334 --> 02:22:16.257]  So, now, if you, if you, that number has risen steadily year on year and year until 2023.
[02:22:17.177 --> 02:22:23.641]  It, the number of Venezuelans crossing the southern border illegally, I just, are you ready for this, Alex?
[02:22:24.241 --> 02:22:25.542]  334,914.
[02:22:24.261 --> 02:22:25.542]  And that's just who they catch.
[02:22:25.642 --> 02:22:27.864]  That's just the Venezuelans they apprehended.
[02:22:27.884 --> 02:22:30.246]  So you've gone from 2,683 in 2017 all the way up here to 334,914 in 2023.
[02:22:30.286 --> 02:22:32.408]  And what is so significant about that?
[02:22:32.428 --> 02:22:33.129]  Well, it's this.
[02:22:33.149 --> 02:22:33.749]  You probably have heard
[02:22:51.289 --> 02:22:55.870]  Lately in the news, people referring to something that isn't very familiar.
[02:22:55.890 --> 02:22:57.231]  It's called Trenda Aragua.
[02:22:57.671 --> 02:22:59.151]  Okay, what is Trenda Aragua?
[02:22:59.372 --> 02:23:01.072]  This is a Venezuelan cartel.
[02:23:01.112 --> 02:23:07.414]  We're very familiar with Sinaloa and Cartel Jalisco Nueva Nacion, the CJNG out of Mexico, right?
[02:23:07.474 --> 02:23:09.975]  Mexico's cartels, we know them, Los Zetas and so on.
[02:23:10.295 --> 02:23:16.457]  But we don't know a lot about Trenda Aragua because this is a cartel that has come out of Venezuela.
[02:23:17.117 --> 02:23:20.798]  And has really infiltrated all across this country.
[02:23:21.099 --> 02:23:23.700]  So why does this matter?
[02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:33.163]  Well, how many people remember when it was reported widely that Venezuela had opened its prisons and that many of those people had come across the border?
[02:23:33.443 --> 02:23:45.468]  Now, I spoke to Venezuelans living inside the United States who had contacted me, reached out, because they were very concerned about the accents that they heard, the type of people that were coming over, and what they were saying.
[02:23:46.428 --> 02:23:52.411]  We've got a whole bunch of videos of Arabs and Chinese and Latin Americans warning terrorists are coming over, you're in trouble!
[02:23:52.772 --> 02:24:05.138]  Yeah, and get this Alex, Trinidad and Tobago, not only is it a very significant Venezuelan cartel, but it was built inside the prison system in Venezuela, okay, by the regime.
[02:24:05.418 --> 02:24:11.942]  So when you hear that Venezuela has emptied its prisons, this isn't a motley collection of murderers and rapists and all the rest of it, no.
[02:24:12.442 --> 02:24:14.824]  This is an organized army.
[02:24:15.584 --> 02:24:24.692]  Of the worst, most violent kind of people that exist, who have- And you add that to the 70,000 trained Afghan terrorists, there's something big planned here.
[02:24:25.332 --> 02:24:27.314]  Well, I mean, look at these numbers.
[02:24:27.514 --> 02:24:32.098]  So, I know you don't want to- you're a journalist, you only cover what's happening, but it's two plus two plus four.
[02:24:32.138 --> 02:24:35.681]  They're planning massive crime, terror attacks, assassinations.
[02:24:36.261 --> 02:24:37.763]  I mean, is this the secret weapon of the left?
[02:24:38.163 --> 02:24:40.085]  Well, okay, you don't have to speculate.
[02:24:40.245 --> 02:24:42.708]  Look at what was just leaked to the media, right?
[02:24:43.169 --> 02:24:51.298]  It was a law enforcement document that showed that Trinidad and Tobago had been given orders from their leadership that U.S.
[02:24:51.358 --> 02:24:53.681]  law enforcement were now legitimate targets.
[02:24:54.141 --> 02:24:55.141]  For them to go after.
[02:24:55.442 --> 02:25:04.905]  So you have a situation where you have one of the most violent and cartels around that is now infiltrated inside the U.S.
[02:25:05.345 --> 02:25:06.086]  You have U.S.
[02:25:06.126 --> 02:25:12.468]  leadership not doing anything about it, and you know that they've been given an order to attack U.S.
[02:25:12.528 --> 02:25:13.209]  law enforcement.
[02:25:13.429 --> 02:25:14.989]  Well, that isn't a random order.
[02:25:15.029 --> 02:25:16.190]  It doesn't come out of nowhere.
[02:25:16.250 --> 02:25:19.371]  Yeah, borders open, attack law enforcement, feds keep border open.
[02:25:19.951 --> 02:25:21.392]  Mayorkas has got something cooking there.
[02:25:21.820 --> 02:25:24.404]  Well the conditions have been set, right?
[02:25:24.744 --> 02:25:29.611]  The conditions have been set for chaos in almost any part of America.
[02:25:29.631 --> 02:25:30.272]  So what's the trigger?
[02:25:31.058 --> 02:25:31.438]  I don't know.
[02:25:31.818 --> 02:25:32.659]  I don't know what the trigger is.
[02:25:32.699 --> 02:25:40.601]  Maybe if they try to, you know, if there's not an opportunity for them to take Trump out, maybe the failure to get rid of him is the trigger.
[02:25:40.741 --> 02:25:42.482]  I mean, it's very difficult to say what we do.
[02:25:42.542 --> 02:25:48.104]  Well, Raskin and others who are top planners have said, we're going to have a racial war and destabilization if Trump wins.
[02:25:48.844 --> 02:25:49.744]  He won't be allowed in.
[02:25:49.884 --> 02:25:51.145]  So that's what they're planning.
[02:25:51.165 --> 02:25:52.465]  Okay, we've already seen that, right?
[02:25:52.525 --> 02:25:55.186]  We know that they have that infrastructure in place.
[02:25:55.266 --> 02:25:57.527]  That's what the George Floyd riots were all about.
[02:25:57.987 --> 02:26:00.328]  And the current walls was helping do.
[02:26:00.808 --> 02:26:05.309]  Yeah, and they take Antifa, they infiltrate them into the streets.
[02:26:05.349 --> 02:26:06.129]  They lead it.
[02:26:06.290 --> 02:26:06.890]  They lead them.
[02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:08.430]  Not only that, they pay.
[02:26:08.730 --> 02:26:09.951]  They pay young black kids.
[02:26:09.971 --> 02:26:10.771]  And they bail them out.
[02:26:10.851 --> 02:26:15.612]  So that they're hoping that those kids get shot or hurt by the police because it furthers their narrative.
[02:26:15.632 --> 02:26:18.073]  That's in their own internal documents we've gotten.
[02:26:18.093 --> 02:26:18.653]  They hope for that.
[02:26:19.033 --> 02:26:19.313]  Yes.
[02:26:19.894 --> 02:26:20.615]  God almighty.
[02:26:20.935 --> 02:26:22.777]  Yeah, so we know what that looks like.
[02:26:22.817 --> 02:26:26.561]  And also, remember that- This is literally like Lex Luthor Legion of Doom stuff.
[02:26:27.102 --> 02:26:28.203]  We're up against supervillains.
[02:26:28.684 --> 02:26:32.468]  They're going to lose everything if they lose this election because they're going to be held accountable.
[02:26:32.788 --> 02:26:36.632]  These people have- Did you see Biden on CBS say, if Trump wins it won't be a peaceful transfer?
[02:26:37.273 --> 02:26:39.894]  Well, that's called projection and shaping.
[02:26:40.055 --> 02:26:46.638]  They're shaping the information battlefield so that people, when it happens, it's just like they've been telling us for years that Texas is going blue.
[02:26:46.918 --> 02:26:48.499]  OK, Texas is not going blue.
[02:26:48.779 --> 02:26:55.663]  Trump said once, don't mean to tell me that a candidate that's against God, against gas and against guns is going to win the state of Texas.
[02:26:55.983 --> 02:26:57.404]  And Trump is absolutely right.
[02:26:57.444 --> 02:27:02.426]  That is an information operation to prepare you for when they steal the elections in Texas.
[02:27:03.567 --> 02:27:05.068]  Texas has been going blue for years.
[02:27:05.188 --> 02:27:07.130]  No, no, that is not true.
[02:27:07.150 --> 02:27:09.532]  There is nothing about Texas that is going blue.
[02:27:09.772 --> 02:27:12.014]  God, can you imagine the Democrats get Texas?
[02:27:13.415 --> 02:27:18.679]  Well, there's some people, political people, who say that there wouldn't be another Republican establishment for a hundred years.
[02:27:18.719 --> 02:27:20.060]  You could argue there wouldn't be one ever.
[02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:22.202]  There'll be a revolt for sure if that happens.
[02:27:22.502 --> 02:27:23.002]  I don't know.
[02:27:23.022 --> 02:27:23.863]  I don't know.
[02:27:23.883 --> 02:27:25.284]  People talk big, you know?
[02:27:25.544 --> 02:27:25.925]  I hear you.
[02:27:26.285 --> 02:27:28.186]  They talk big, but we don't see a lot of action.
[02:27:28.507 --> 02:27:29.287]  People are scared.
[02:27:29.307 --> 02:27:30.909]  I agree.
[02:27:30.969 --> 02:27:32.390]  So how do we stop this?
[02:27:34.042 --> 02:27:35.003]  Why are you asking me?
[02:27:35.404 --> 02:27:36.205]  No, I'm just kidding.
[02:27:36.966 --> 02:27:38.027]  No, you're a smart lady.
[02:27:38.107 --> 02:27:38.668]  I mean that.
[02:27:39.321 --> 02:28:03.135]  Okay, well I can tell you what, so intelligence operatives who have seen these tactics, who have used these tactics in foreign countries, trained by the United States government to use these tactics to bring down foreign governments, the one thing that they have said to me consistently from the beginning of this is that the only time they ever saw these tactics fail is when the people unite.
[02:28:03.375 --> 02:28:04.876]  Yeah, there's a counter operation.
[02:28:05.305 --> 02:28:06.146]  When the people unite.
[02:28:06.987 --> 02:28:14.495]  When you stand together, when the people realize their power, and they stand together, the tactics do not work.
[02:28:14.855 --> 02:28:22.444]  That's why they pour so much money, and organization, and effort, and personnel, and infrastructure, and so on, into keeping us divided.
[02:28:26.730 --> 02:28:27.710]  Maximum division.
[02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:29.410]  And that's what technology is about.
[02:28:29.450 --> 02:28:33.831]  They create these feedback loops, is what it's called.
[02:28:33.851 --> 02:28:34.671]  Bubbles.
[02:28:35.011 --> 02:28:35.271]  Yes!
[02:28:35.572 --> 02:28:36.772]  You live in your little bubble.
[02:28:36.792 --> 02:28:38.672]  So you're physically isolated.
[02:28:38.692 --> 02:28:39.832]  Look what COVID did to us.
[02:28:40.252 --> 02:28:42.833]  I mean, we're physically isolated from each other.
[02:28:43.153 --> 02:28:46.533]  That's what 15-minute cities and all these other things are about.
[02:28:46.793 --> 02:28:48.714]  Keeping you geographically isolated.
[02:28:49.014 --> 02:28:51.994]  You're ideologically isolated by the technology.
[02:28:52.374 --> 02:28:55.275]  And once you're all isolated, I mean, if we can't travel,
[02:28:55.675 --> 02:28:57.298]  Or see what's really happening in London.
[02:28:57.358 --> 02:28:58.660]  And that's why they want us off air.
[02:28:58.680 --> 02:29:04.350]  It's not that I'm that important, but people will tune in here and they don't want anybody having a focal point to tell them what's happening.
[02:29:04.833 --> 02:29:07.655]  No, because in the digital realm, they can tell you whatever they want.
[02:29:07.676 --> 02:29:10.758]  They can tell you that Larry Elder is a white supremacist, even though he's black.
[02:29:10.998 --> 02:29:11.179]  Yeah.
[02:29:11.239 --> 02:29:12.320]  They can say whatever they like.
[02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:15.422]  Because in the digital world, it doesn't have to be true.
[02:29:15.923 --> 02:29:18.585]  It's a metaverse.
[02:29:19.726 --> 02:29:20.547]  It is a metaverse.
[02:29:20.587 --> 02:29:24.490]  I mean, these games like Minecraft and Sims, you know, my kids hate it when I say this.
[02:29:24.510 --> 02:29:25.231]  They roll their eyes.
[02:29:25.271 --> 02:29:26.131]  They say, come on, Mom.
[02:29:26.392 --> 02:29:27.473]  But these are training.
[02:29:27.913 --> 02:29:28.453]  These are training.
[02:29:28.473 --> 02:29:29.795]  They have better training wheels for tyranny.
[02:29:30.375 --> 02:29:32.297]  That's what they are, and for absolute control.
[02:29:33.553 --> 02:29:39.096]  So, if you had to pull back, Laura Logan, really smart lady, so accomplished, I mean that, you're an amazing person, everybody knows that.
[02:29:39.616 --> 02:29:40.057]  Thank you.
[02:29:40.837 --> 02:29:41.477]  Well, I don't thank you.
[02:29:41.797 --> 02:29:42.598]  Thank you for existing.
[02:29:44.159 --> 02:29:46.980]  What, I mean, I think we've got the odds, but like 55 to 45.
[02:29:47.020 --> 02:29:54.244]  We can win this if we're serious and focused and pray, but if we don't, let's give them the negative.
[02:29:54.384 --> 02:29:58.126]  If we don't do the right things, what will it look like if they steal the election?
[02:29:58.166 --> 02:30:00.227]  What will the globalists, people think, oh, they'll just go away.
[02:30:00.287 --> 02:30:01.148]  No, they're going to go for broke.
[02:30:02.017 --> 02:30:06.600]  Look, first thing I have to say to you is, what is the voter turnout in this country?
[02:30:07.301 --> 02:30:11.624]  I mean, if people are really worried about this election, they should be ashamed of themselves when they look at voter turnout.
[02:30:11.644 --> 02:30:11.624]  65%?
[02:30:12.985 --> 02:30:17.087]  Well, the Republican primary nationwide, the turnout was less than 35%.
[02:30:17.348 --> 02:30:17.988]  Yeah.
[02:30:18.929 --> 02:30:29.316]  Okay, so it's, you know, if you're looking at this election as the most important election in history, and you're not bothered to go and vote, then there's something wrong with you.
[02:30:29.773 --> 02:30:30.473]  No, you're right.
[02:30:30.733 --> 02:30:33.955]  It's 35 in the primary, like 60-something in the general.
[02:30:34.355 --> 02:30:34.755]  We need 90%.
[02:30:34.995 --> 02:30:42.098]  Yeah, I mean, if people are serious about having a say in the running of this country, they have to get out and vote.
[02:30:42.378 --> 02:30:44.779]  And then they say, oh, but it's a fraudulent election.
[02:30:44.799 --> 02:30:46.060]  We've done the numbers of all the experts.
[02:30:46.360 --> 02:30:49.201]  They only have so many dead people and fraudulent votes.
[02:30:49.241 --> 02:30:51.162]  We have to override that with too big to rig.
[02:30:51.769 --> 02:30:54.010]  Well, the thing is, if you don't show up and vote, you've got no chance.
[02:30:54.530 --> 02:30:54.831]  Okay?
[02:30:54.871 --> 02:30:56.792]  So, your best chance is to go and vote.
[02:30:57.372 --> 02:31:04.516]  And it doesn't mean that you're going to be able to overwhelm all those things, but you absolutely have zero chance of prevailing.
[02:31:04.676 --> 02:31:06.277]  Half of victory is showing up.
[02:31:06.877 --> 02:31:07.177]  Yes.
[02:31:07.877 --> 02:31:08.658]  Without a doubt.
[02:31:09.398 --> 02:31:14.221]  And, you know, I have to tell you, you don't need me to tell you this, the Democrats figured that out a long time ago.
[02:31:15.074 --> 02:31:15.815]  A long time ago.
[02:31:15.835 --> 02:31:16.335]  They show up.
[02:31:16.756 --> 02:31:18.978]  Yes, absolutely they show up.
[02:31:18.998 --> 02:31:20.459]  So, I mean, that's the one thing.
[02:31:20.499 --> 02:31:24.583]  The other thing is, General Flynn said this to me not so long ago.
[02:31:24.643 --> 02:31:27.405]  He said, you know, people need to realize that Trump is just a life raft.
[02:31:27.925 --> 02:31:29.147]  Okay, we're in a tsunami.
[02:31:29.767 --> 02:31:36.033]  And if we're lucky enough, if we're lucky enough that we get that life raft to take us, you know, to the other side.
[02:31:36.113 --> 02:31:37.254]  He'll just give us a beachhead.
[02:31:37.594 --> 02:31:38.534]  Then we have a chance.
[02:31:39.114 --> 02:31:41.375]  But it's going to take every person standing up.
[02:31:41.695 --> 02:31:44.435]  And Alex, here's something that I just I want to say.
[02:31:45.095 --> 02:31:52.997]  It's very natural and instinctive for people not to want to take risks and be an outlier and expose themselves.
[02:31:53.117 --> 02:31:54.997]  We are by nature herd animals.
[02:31:55.337 --> 02:31:59.598]  And you hear people being very derisive about, you know, people are sheeple and all the rest of it.
[02:32:00.078 --> 02:32:02.218]  And I understand where that comes from.
[02:32:02.618 --> 02:32:05.939]  But if you recognize that there's safety in numbers,
[02:32:06.579 --> 02:32:09.381]  That's why people gravitate towards each other.
[02:32:09.401 --> 02:32:11.862]  That's why there are more followers than leaders, okay?
[02:32:12.502 --> 02:32:21.107]  And so they're counting on that human instinct of ours to gravitate towards each other, have that safety in numbers, and not raise your hand because you don't want to get chopped off.
[02:32:21.487 --> 02:32:24.689]  The problem is that that is a false sense of security.
[02:32:24.709 --> 02:32:29.732]  Because when the social contract's broken, you must resist to be a leader via survival.
[02:32:30.012 --> 02:32:30.753]  I totally agree.
[02:32:30.953 --> 02:32:32.574]  And the social contract is broken.
[02:32:33.394 --> 02:32:34.075]  It is broken.
[02:32:35.255 --> 02:32:36.836]  And this is just the beginning.
[02:32:36.876 --> 02:32:41.199]  We are in a spiritual war, as many people have talked about.
[02:32:41.279 --> 02:32:42.720]  It really is a spiritual battle.
[02:32:43.361 --> 02:32:46.063]  And this is a moment now.
[02:32:46.363 --> 02:33:00.152]  I mean, if you just look at your children or your grandchildren and you think about the world that you want them to grow up in, I couldn't imagine the world that they envisage for our children is so dark.
[02:33:00.212 --> 02:33:02.874]  In fact, someone who studied this... They're going to sexually chop them up!
[02:33:03.394 --> 02:33:21.000]  Well, Alex, someone who studied this for a living told me that if you look at the world of the cartels in Mexico, right, where they chop people up on a regular basis, kill anybody they want, and so on and so on, that's the physical manifestation of what the world looks like if the global cult prevails.
[02:33:22.961 --> 02:33:23.761]  Because they're evil.
[02:33:23.861 --> 02:33:25.282]  I mean, they're going to manifest.
[02:33:25.302 --> 02:33:28.443]  If good people don't do anything, as Thomas Everson said, we give it over to these evil people.
[02:33:28.936 --> 02:33:29.917]  Well, and here's another thing.
[02:33:29.957 --> 02:33:33.298]  How many times have you heard people say, oh, I can't watch the news anymore.
[02:33:33.358 --> 02:33:34.259]  I can't take it anymore.
[02:33:34.539 --> 02:33:37.221]  You know, I just- They want to overwhelm you and make you give up.
[02:33:37.361 --> 02:33:42.644]  Well, what they have done is, if you imagine this is an undeclared war, the entire world is our battlefield.
[02:33:42.924 --> 02:33:44.905]  Every single one of us is a soldier, right?
[02:33:45.365 --> 02:33:50.408]  And so if you're a soldier on that battlefield and you say, I don't want to participate.
[02:33:50.508 --> 02:33:51.349]  So you withdraw.
[02:33:51.489 --> 02:33:53.030]  Well, that's the equivalent of surrender.
[02:33:53.330 --> 02:33:54.871]  You just gave up that- Exactly.
[02:33:54.891 --> 02:33:56.431]  There's election fraud, so I won't vote.
[02:33:56.491 --> 02:33:57.252]  You've just given up.
[02:33:57.512 --> 02:33:57.973]  You've given up?
[02:33:57.993 --> 02:34:00.436]  You think you're removing yourself and winning?
[02:34:00.496 --> 02:34:01.638]  No, you just let them win.
[02:34:01.658 --> 02:34:05.002]  I am a never surrender person.
[02:34:05.843 --> 02:34:07.005]  Never surrender.
[02:34:07.025 --> 02:34:10.710]  Okay, even to the last breath in my body, I will fight.
[02:34:11.090 --> 02:34:13.053]  They will never take my freedom.
[02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:14.321]  It doesn't exist.
[02:34:14.441 --> 02:34:15.643]  I don't even consider it.
[02:34:15.663 --> 02:34:18.847]  You know, I would have a lot of people, especially when I was at 60 Minutes,
[02:34:31.224 --> 02:34:37.870]  I have a lot of people come to me and say, you know, that they wanted to work for me or with me or to do what I do and so on.
[02:34:38.190 --> 02:34:42.814]  And they would always be surprised because I wouldn't say, which college did you go to?
[02:34:43.135 --> 02:34:45.497]  How did you do in your degree or, you know, whatever.
[02:34:45.897 --> 02:34:47.038]  How many languages do you speak?
[02:34:47.118 --> 02:34:48.359]  I didn't ask those questions.
[02:34:48.820 --> 02:34:51.022]  My only question was, who are you?
[02:34:52.259 --> 02:34:53.580]  And most of them didn't know.
[02:34:54.360 --> 02:34:56.021]  And then I would send them away.
[02:34:56.061 --> 02:34:59.464]  I would say, well, when you figure out who you are, then come back to me.
[02:34:59.524 --> 02:35:04.927]  Because if you really want to do this job in a way that counts, you have to know who you are.
[02:35:04.947 --> 02:35:07.769]  And it's the same for how you approach everything in your life.
[02:35:07.889 --> 02:35:12.092]  Once you know who you are and you know what you stand for, they can never take that.
[02:35:12.372 --> 02:35:14.433]  I forget the philosopher said, first you must know yourself.
[02:35:15.094 --> 02:35:15.314]  Yes.
[02:35:16.653 --> 02:35:23.355]  Yes, otherwise you can be manipulated, you can be, you know, misled, you can be constantly deceived and used.
[02:35:23.475 --> 02:35:24.475]  So what is your anchor?
[02:35:24.535 --> 02:35:25.556]  Who are you at the base?
[02:35:25.596 --> 02:35:26.296]  What do you stand for?
[02:35:27.156 --> 02:35:28.057]  What is your allegiance to?
[02:35:28.757 --> 02:35:29.017]  God.
[02:35:32.418 --> 02:35:32.778]  That's it.
[02:35:33.458 --> 02:35:42.061]  Well, I think, and I know the enemy's losing right now, but if you have this Q stuff that we're invincible and everything's fine, it's all White House run things, that is very dangerous.
[02:35:42.580 --> 02:35:43.902]  Oh yeah, no, that's a terrible idea.
[02:35:45.604 --> 02:35:50.169]  If you think that you can literally, you know, stand there and watch the building is on fire, right?
[02:35:50.209 --> 02:35:52.051]  And you're waiting for the fire department to come in.
[02:35:52.091 --> 02:35:53.353]  No, that's going to be too late.
[02:35:53.914 --> 02:35:54.654]  It's too big.
[02:35:55.155 --> 02:35:57.978]  It's too big because, you know, even this is what I say to people.
[02:35:57.998 --> 02:36:01.483]  Can you imagine if Donald Trump were to be reelected?
[02:36:01.903 --> 02:36:02.824]  So what is he going to do?
[02:36:02.924 --> 02:36:16.216]  Dispatch the FBI, the same people who are still arresting and incarcerating American citizens for misdemeanor offenses that are nonviolent, for exercising their constitutional rights on January 6th.
[02:36:16.476 --> 02:36:17.797]  They're still putting them in prison.
[02:36:18.197 --> 02:36:20.199]  So you think these people are going to go and arrest who?
[02:36:20.239 --> 02:36:20.579]  Let me see.
[02:36:21.340 --> 02:36:26.982]  Wait, the seditious conspiracy to overturn an election and undermine a legally elected president.
[02:36:27.302 --> 02:36:36.685]  We got John Brennan, we got James Clapper, we've got Obama, Biden, Sally Yates, Hillary Clinton, I mean, Mark Elias.
[02:36:36.765 --> 02:36:47.288]  I mean, how many people, powerful people, you really think the same FBI, the same Justice Department, they're just going to roll up to their doors, arrest all these people, and we're going to have real accountability and justice?
[02:36:47.748 --> 02:36:48.489]  It's delusional.
[02:36:48.689 --> 02:36:49.610]  Yeah, it's delusional.
[02:36:49.910 --> 02:36:51.972]  It's going to take something much greater than that.
[02:36:52.412 --> 02:37:04.403]  And if people think that they can just hang it all on Trump, you know, one thing that frustrates me is I do hear people, you know, they don't want to be associated with, well, Trump this and Trump that and Trump's a narcissist and Trump's bad personality.
[02:37:04.943 --> 02:37:13.471]  And it's kind of like, OK, I see the vision of the world that that Trump represents and I see the vision of the world that these
[02:37:15.072 --> 02:37:20.854]  Radical, progressive, Marxist, technocrat, this global cult wants to create.
[02:37:21.254 --> 02:37:22.955]  And I know exactly where I stand.
[02:37:23.255 --> 02:37:26.236]  So don't waste my time in a personality contest.
[02:37:26.296 --> 02:37:28.977]  I'm not interested in your personality contest.
[02:37:29.277 --> 02:37:32.658]  And we've had enough time now to see what the actions are.
[02:37:32.678 --> 02:37:34.019]  I mean all this nonsense.
[02:37:34.079 --> 02:37:39.020]  Oh yeah, I had a family member like a week ago go, I read this book about Trump and he's a bad guy.
[02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:42.241]  And I looked at it and a communist wrote it and I said, I don't want to hear what they have to say.
[02:37:42.261 --> 02:37:43.522]  I can look at what Trump's done.
[02:37:43.942 --> 02:37:45.983]  I don't need to go off what some communist says.
[02:37:46.403 --> 02:37:46.863]  That's right.
[02:37:47.783 --> 02:37:48.623]  That's exactly right.
[02:37:48.663 --> 02:37:49.344]  That's my point.
[02:37:51.884 --> 02:37:54.845]  So we have, what, 88 days left of the election.
[02:37:54.925 --> 02:37:56.045]  I'm Laura Logan.
[02:37:56.065 --> 02:37:59.566]  I'm more concerned about the 79 days after he's president-elect, what they're going to pull.
[02:38:00.347 --> 02:38:01.647]  Well, that's a big concern.
[02:38:01.767 --> 02:38:03.688]  And not just the 79 days, right?
[02:38:03.748 --> 02:38:06.308]  But the entire time, if he manages to stay in office.
[02:38:06.348 --> 02:38:08.729]  I mean, just, they tried to kill him when he was a candidate.
[02:38:08.769 --> 02:38:11.890]  Doesn't mean they won't try to kill him if he, you know, became the president again.
[02:38:12.588 --> 02:38:15.370]  Well, anybody that's saying we're in boring times is not awake.
[02:38:15.390 --> 02:38:17.252]  I mean, these are, like, nail-biting.
[02:38:18.012 --> 02:38:28.820]  This is... You know, did you notice, though, around, even before that assassination attempt happened, did you see that JFK kept popping up all across the media?
[02:38:28.860 --> 02:38:28.961]  Yes.
[02:38:29.041 --> 02:38:31.663]  And you have to wonder about that parallel, right?
[02:38:32.043 --> 02:38:35.766]  How is it that we still don't have answers on JFK's assassination attempt?
[02:38:35.806 --> 02:38:39.729]  Is this where we're going to be, like, half a century later, still no answers on Trump?
[02:38:41.223 --> 02:38:47.625]  Well that's the thing, I think there's a very, and I'm not trying to make this happen, but there's a very good chance they kill Trump in the next few months.
[02:38:48.245 --> 02:38:55.908]  You know, there's one thing, well there's a couple things about the American system, Alex, that get lost in translation in the rest of the world.
[02:38:55.988 --> 02:39:09.693]  And one is that this concept that your elected officials serve you, that the government is of the people and for the people and by the people, this is a concept that really doesn't exist in the same way anywhere else in the world.
[02:39:10.413 --> 02:39:14.755]  And it's the thing that, it's so easy, too many Americans seem to have forgotten this.
[02:39:15.175 --> 02:39:17.937]  And they don't really know what their rights are.
[02:39:18.357 --> 02:39:20.998]  I mean, people don't even know what their rights are at the polling stations.
[02:39:21.539 --> 02:39:23.760]  They really don't know what their rights are to election records.
[02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:29.303]  At every polling station, they have to document exactly everything that goes wrong with the election.
[02:39:29.943 --> 02:39:32.764]  And that isn't even counted in the official election records.
[02:39:33.024 --> 02:39:35.866]  But you, as a member of that county, you have a right to those records.
[02:39:36.266 --> 02:39:49.351]  I mean, if every citizen just requested those records, you would have a much better idea of what goes on in your elections than from reading any article, or listening to any decision in a court case, or what any journalist has to say.
[02:39:49.371 --> 02:39:51.432]  I totally agree.
[02:39:51.452 --> 02:39:57.294]  You're going to host a little bit more of this in the next hour, and then Drew Hernandez takes over, but you're going to be hosting the first two hours tomorrow.
[02:39:57.748 --> 02:39:59.148]  Yes, you talked me into that.
[02:39:59.648 --> 02:40:00.209]  I love it.
[02:40:00.609 --> 02:40:01.029]  I'm excited.
[02:40:01.049 --> 02:40:01.469]  You excited?
[02:40:03.189 --> 02:40:04.329]  We'll see afterwards.
[02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:05.370]  I'll be excited.
[02:40:05.450 --> 02:40:06.150]  You know, I'm one of those.
[02:40:06.210 --> 02:40:07.070]  I want to do it well.
[02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:09.211]  When I've done it well, then I'll be excited.
[02:40:09.311 --> 02:40:10.431]  I'm sure you will do well.
[02:40:10.911 --> 02:40:12.311]  You have done well, Lord Vader.
[02:40:13.392 --> 02:40:14.172]  I want to play this clip.
[02:40:14.192 --> 02:40:14.732]  This is Trump.
[02:40:14.752 --> 02:40:16.392]  We're very close to World War.
[02:40:16.952 --> 02:40:18.133]  He just had a press conference.
[02:40:18.193 --> 02:40:18.833]  It just ended.
[02:40:18.853 --> 02:40:21.793]  We've got a bunch of clips here of Trump.
[02:40:21.813 --> 02:40:22.294]  Here's Trump.
[02:40:22.334 --> 02:40:23.694]  We're very close to World War.
[02:40:23.734 --> 02:40:24.034]  Here it is.
[02:40:25.314 --> 02:40:27.596]  Just a statement before I talk about debates.
[02:40:28.577 --> 02:40:38.305]  I think that our country is right now in the most dangerous position it's ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.
[02:40:40.266 --> 02:40:47.212]  Both gangs on the street and frankly gangs outside of our country in the form of other countries that are frankly very powerful.
[02:40:47.332 --> 02:40:49.874]  They're very powerful countries and we don't know what we're doing.
[02:40:49.914 --> 02:40:51.535]  We have leadership that has no clue.
[02:40:52.438 --> 02:40:55.179]  How to handle them or how to handle any other situation.
[02:40:56.099 --> 02:41:00.761]  We have a lot of bad things coming up.
[02:41:00.821 --> 02:41:06.723]  You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety, which would be a devastating thing.
[02:41:06.743 --> 02:41:09.004]  Took many years, took decades to recover from it.
[02:41:10.285 --> 02:41:11.365]  And we're very close to that.
[02:41:11.545 --> 02:41:13.006]  We're very close to a world war.
[02:41:13.066 --> 02:41:16.907]  In my opinion, we're very close to a world where we have people that don't know how to handle it.
[02:41:17.968 --> 02:41:20.309]  They're not respected all over the world.
[02:41:20.329 --> 02:41:20.969]  They're left at.
[02:41:22.256 --> 02:41:23.136]  And we can't have that.
[02:41:23.777 --> 02:41:26.258]  Most dangerous period of time I've ever seen for our country.
[02:41:27.098 --> 02:41:27.999]  Total truth.
[02:41:29.239 --> 02:41:31.260]  You see, he looked stressed there.
[02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:32.381]  He's next level now.
[02:41:32.841 --> 02:41:32.941]  Yeah.
[02:41:32.961 --> 02:41:36.763]  He's not the overconfident Trump, which I like this.
[02:41:37.383 --> 02:41:40.664]  I like the fact that he looks not scared, but really... Serious.
[02:41:40.784 --> 02:41:41.465]  Very serious.
[02:41:41.485 --> 02:41:42.105]  Brave.
[02:41:42.145 --> 02:41:42.345]  Yeah.
[02:41:42.445 --> 02:41:42.845]  Brave.
[02:41:43.025 --> 02:41:43.326]  Yeah.
[02:41:43.386 --> 02:41:43.766]  Brave.
[02:41:44.466 --> 02:41:46.267]  Yeah, that's... Because we're in a grave situation.
[02:41:46.656 --> 02:41:48.517]  We are in a grave situation, actually.
[02:41:48.577 --> 02:41:49.757]  This is a very bad time.
[02:41:49.777 --> 02:41:57.901]  You know, Alex, a couple years ago, I hosted an event in Canada for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, right?
[02:41:57.921 --> 02:42:15.628]  There's a lot of Jewish people in the audience, and I moderated a conversation between Ehud Barak and others, and the question, the last question that I posed at that event was, I said, I know this is going to be controversial, a lot of you won't like it, but my question is, will Israel still exist 50 years from now?
[02:42:16.588 --> 02:42:18.890]  And there was a sharp intake of breath in the audience.
[02:42:19.390 --> 02:42:24.693]  And people thought, you know, that I was, um, that that was, you know, some people thought that wasn't a valid question.
[02:42:24.713 --> 02:42:32.457]  But you have to ask yourself, when you look at the situation in the Middle East today, is that really such a, you know, an outlandish question?
[02:42:32.778 --> 02:42:34.399]  Or is that a very reasonable question?
[02:42:34.779 --> 02:42:38.141]  Because I was talking to General Flynn just a couple of days ago.
[02:42:38.541 --> 02:42:41.423]  He said Israel does not have the ability
[02:42:42.083 --> 02:42:48.888]  That's a big deal, and obviously that's not just a reasonable question, it's central
[02:43:11.618 --> 02:43:12.519]  Will Israel exist?
[02:43:12.559 --> 02:43:13.619]  That's a very serious question.
[02:43:14.099 --> 02:43:15.720]  It's a very serious question.
[02:43:15.820 --> 02:43:18.842]  And what does it mean if it doesn't?
[02:43:18.882 --> 02:43:26.186]  And what does that say about us as a civilization, given the origins of Israel?
[02:43:26.246 --> 02:43:33.930]  And I know there's a lot there for people to unpack in terms of Israel's role in a lot of things that are going on.
[02:43:33.970 --> 02:43:40.394]  But at the end of the day, we are in a very serious situation in the Middle East.
[02:43:40.834 --> 02:43:42.976]  One that we have not seen in our lifetime.
[02:43:42.996 --> 02:43:45.939]  Well yeah, Israel's in danger of being destroyed and they have nuclear weapons.
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:46.880]  Yes.
[02:43:47.020 --> 02:43:48.681]  So there's a Samson option.
[02:43:49.022 --> 02:43:51.344]  We're going to start the next hour, 31 minutes, with Laura Logan.
[02:43:51.364 --> 02:43:54.707]  She's going to be hosting tomorrow, the first two hours.
[02:43:55.087 --> 02:43:55.668]  I'd love to be here.
[02:43:55.688 --> 02:43:56.809]  I'm in court, stuff to deal with.
[02:43:57.209 --> 02:44:00.532]  But I'll be back Saturday and Sunday, I will ensure, coming up 3 p.m.
[02:44:00.572 --> 02:44:01.173]  Central today.
[02:44:01.193 --> 02:44:03.375]  We're about to start hour number four here.
[02:44:03.455 --> 02:44:06.238]  But a few of the clips from Trump's ongoing press conference
[02:44:06.718 --> 02:44:08.960]  The presidency was taken away from Joe Biden.
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:10.401]  He had the right to run.
[02:44:10.802 --> 02:44:12.743]  Trump is pointing out a central issue there.
[02:44:13.224 --> 02:44:18.748]  Trump reminds voters Kamala was the first one in the 2020 primaries to basically drop out because she had no support.
[02:44:19.609 --> 02:44:22.592]  Trump, if Kamala became president, our country is going to be a giant fail.
[02:44:22.612 --> 02:44:27.476]  I think that is a very accurate statement.
[02:44:28.297 --> 02:44:33.161]  Trump says that he has agreed to three debates on Fox, but Kamala has not.
[02:44:34.755 --> 02:44:39.199]  While she runs around cackling like a demonic hyena, saying Trump is scared.
[02:44:39.219 --> 02:44:42.702]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[02:44:43.222 --> 02:44:43.563]  It is.
[02:44:43.643 --> 02:44:44.484]  It's all ridiculous.
[02:44:45.224 --> 02:44:48.347]  And then you got Tim Walz caught red-handed and stolen valor.
[02:44:48.807 --> 02:44:50.289]  Back in two minutes with Laura Logan.
[02:44:51.420 --> 02:44:55.403]  You've seen what President Trump has gone through in the last eight years.
[02:44:55.423 --> 02:44:58.224]  And you've seen a lot of the things that Infowars has gone through.
[02:44:58.845 --> 02:45:04.888]  And I want to thank all of you over the years for your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support, because without you, we would not be on the air.
[02:45:05.409 --> 02:45:10.052]  Now, without getting into a two-hour long story, in the process of the bankruptcy in the last two years,
[02:45:10.752 --> 02:45:22.301]  We were basically sabotaged and the people that were brought in here to supposedly run things didn't reorder product, even though there was plenty of money at the time, to basically put this operation in a position of shutting down.
[02:45:22.902 --> 02:45:31.688]  But by the grace of God, years ago, I set up backup supplement line from one of the main providers of the raw materials we were using.
[02:45:32.129 --> 02:45:34.851]  And so many of these InfoWars MD products
[02:45:35.492 --> 02:45:41.260]  Are actually our famous products simply private labeled and others are different formulas this company offers.
[02:45:41.580 --> 02:45:42.601]  They're all top of the line.
[02:45:42.621 --> 02:45:43.663]  They're already best sellers.
[02:45:43.963 --> 02:45:49.411]  They're already all over the market and in stores and online under other names, but they are all the very best.
[02:45:49.892 --> 02:45:51.995]  So this line is called Info Wars MD.
[02:45:53.004 --> 02:45:54.726]  Our supplements are basically all sold out.
[02:45:55.107 --> 02:45:58.731]  Only a few things are left, like X2, X3, and some of the other amazing products.
[02:45:59.152 --> 02:46:01.715]  But with InfoWars MD, you have Turmeric 95.
[02:46:02.215 --> 02:46:05.119]  That is the same formula as Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:46:05.479 --> 02:46:07.381]  You have the Nitric Boost.
[02:46:07.401 --> 02:46:09.124]  It's so good for your heart cardiovascular system.
[02:46:09.464 --> 02:46:10.986]  It is the exact same
[02:46:11.186 --> 02:46:11.446]  Thank you.
[02:46:33.107 --> 02:46:35.068]  Get great products and help keep us on the air.
[02:46:35.168 --> 02:46:36.369]  I need you to take action.
[02:46:36.669 --> 02:46:37.810]  You will love these products.
[02:46:38.050 --> 02:46:39.390]  They work really, really good.
[02:46:39.630 --> 02:46:49.635]  No matter which one you try, they're already top of the line, tested, private label by us, available right now at InfoWarsStore.com under the InfoWars MD label.
[02:46:49.836 --> 02:46:50.616]  Thank you for your support.
[02:46:57.695 --> 02:47:16.210]  Act Blue, the insidious George Soros tax-exempt political organization, an organization where billionaires dump money into pseudo grassroots movements designed to throw a wrench in federal, state, and local government foolish enough to allow the minions of Soros's lies to fester.
[02:47:16.690 --> 02:47:23.336]  Act Blue was once described in a human rights article as, quote, not driven by the average Democrat.
[02:47:23.616 --> 02:47:31.624]  As their image may suggest, they are rather mouthpieces for the radical agendas of the likes of Soros and labor unions.
[02:47:31.824 --> 02:47:39.211]  You really need to bring China into the creation of a new world order.
[02:47:39.651 --> 02:47:42.754]  George Soros has been a controversial topic.
[02:47:42.974 --> 02:47:45.816]  His past is well known and his enemies are many.
[02:47:45.996 --> 02:48:01.248]  But after the media defended his public image recently, he had fallen off the radar, which gave Soros and those that would dismantle the United States enough time and cover to reinforce their radical activism infesting major U.S.
[02:48:01.329 --> 02:48:01.689]  cities.
[02:48:02.029 --> 02:48:04.211]  It became accepted common knowledge,
[02:48:04.531 --> 02:48:09.614]  And although it is completely antithetical to the survival of our republic, U.S.
[02:48:09.674 --> 02:48:15.417]  politicians have done relatively nothing to stop it, and it's been ignored by media as it grew.
[02:48:15.697 --> 02:48:29.464]  The students who are out there right now protesting, they are mourning the loss of their classmates, and frankly of their innocence to some extent, knowing that they have to be prepared for what might be a massacre.
[02:48:29.904 --> 02:48:39.126]  Fellow Americans, who is directly behind the national movement to manipulate American youth into signing away their Second Amendment rights?
[02:48:39.466 --> 02:48:51.949]  At this point, you can blindly throw a dart at the chaos inhabiting the United States, and it will land on an organization directly funded by one of George Soros' Open Society foundations.
[02:48:52.489 --> 02:48:53.569]  And under that umbrella,
[02:48:53.809 --> 02:49:01.212]  Yet another radical left umbrella directly connected to the student walkout movement, the Tides Foundation.
[02:49:01.632 --> 02:49:06.233]  womensmarch.com organized the student walkout protest.
[02:49:06.454 --> 02:49:10.175]  Scrolling down to the bottom of the Women's March global website,
[02:49:10.575 --> 02:49:20.240]  We learn they are a project of the Tide Center, a radical left funding machine created by a name synonymous with George Soros, Drummond Pike.
[02:49:20.660 --> 02:49:33.346]  In 2008, Pike anonymously donated $1 million to ACORN after Dale Rathke, the brother of ACORN's founder, Wade Rathke, was found to have embezzled $948,670.50 from the group and affiliated charitable organizations.
[02:49:40.209 --> 02:49:45.035]  Acorn had previously received funding from the Tides Foundation.
[02:49:45.476 --> 02:49:58.992]  A reminder, Black Lives Matter may appear to be some organic movement of African Americans fed up with the man, but it is simply a front for more Soros activity to divide and conquer.
[02:49:59.392 --> 02:50:03.697]  Bus fare, hotel rooms, and manufactured signs cost real money.
[02:50:03.918 --> 02:50:10.406]  Its two main financial supporters are Democracy Alliance and the Freedom Road Socialist Organization.
[02:50:10.706 --> 02:50:16.754]  Politico wrote, Democracy Alliance was created in 2005 by a handful of major donors.
[02:50:16.994 --> 02:50:17.574]  We're good to go.
[02:50:36.622 --> 02:50:48.631]  Breitbart reported the foundation has, for instance, donated millions to the Mexican nationalist organization La Raza, the group founded to reclaim the southwestern United States for Mexico.
[02:50:48.871 --> 02:50:58.137]  In 2015, the foundation gave $2,400,000 to the National Council of La Raza for general operating support.
[02:50:58.518 --> 02:51:04.382]  The Kellogg Foundation also has deep ties and associations with George Soros and the Clintons.
[02:51:04.702 --> 02:51:11.524]  Breitbart News noted that Kellogg gave $200,000 to George Soros' far-left Open Society Institute.
[02:51:11.844 --> 02:51:18.407]  Kellogg also gave $930,000 to Black Lives Matter and millions to the Clintons and Soros.
[02:51:18.747 --> 02:51:25.749]  When I looked into the groups, the Civil Rights Unit, who's suing us, and the Voting Rights Institute at Georgetown,
[02:51:26.489 --> 02:51:38.013]  Every member of their advisory board for Voting Rights Institute, all 12 people, were directly working with organizations that are directly funded by George Soros' Open Society.
[02:51:38.473 --> 02:51:39.514]  Every single one of them.
[02:51:39.534 --> 02:51:40.354]  It's incredible.
[02:51:40.754 --> 02:51:43.475]  This guy thought he was the messiah 30 years ago when he wrote a book.
[02:51:44.035 --> 02:51:46.696]  But in a way, he kind of is the messiah of evil.
[02:51:46.796 --> 02:51:49.277]  I mean, he's like the devil's messiah.
[02:51:49.957 --> 02:51:52.919]  Well, the amazing Laura Logan is our guest.
[02:51:52.939 --> 02:51:55.401]  She's hosting the show tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:51:55.441 --> 02:51:56.842]  Central, 12 noon Eastern.
[02:51:58.002 --> 02:52:01.905]  We got some amazing clips of Trump from his statement and press conference.
[02:52:03.226 --> 02:52:03.726]  That's it.
[02:52:04.847 --> 02:52:09.911]  We're going to get to it, but I just wanted to get you to make any other comments you wanted to get out there before we did this.
[02:52:10.431 --> 02:52:10.891]  About what?
[02:52:11.772 --> 02:52:13.673]  The entire panacea of what's happening.
[02:52:15.374 --> 02:52:18.576]  Okay, nothing like throw me a curveball right there, Alex.
[02:52:21.477 --> 02:52:33.546]  Well, I gotta say, one of the things that concerns me the most, because I'm a mom, is the trans ideology and what is happening with our education system.
[02:52:33.686 --> 02:52:47.676]  General Flynn always says, you know, I'm on the board of his foundation, and we do these counter-trafficking events around the country together, and he always tells people that the first thing he would do, if he were Trump, and he got back in office, is not go after the DOJ
[02:52:48.576 --> 02:52:49.597]  Or the FBI.
[02:52:49.737 --> 02:52:51.738]  It would be to get rid of the Department of Education.
[02:52:52.198 --> 02:52:52.438]  Yeah.
[02:52:53.198 --> 02:52:53.959]  That's the real cult.
[02:52:54.559 --> 02:52:55.659]  That's the real cult.
[02:52:56.220 --> 02:53:01.002]  And, um, you know, the way I explain it is kind of like this.
[02:53:01.602 --> 02:53:05.664]  If you or I saw a picture, as you can find easily on the internet, right?
[02:53:06.084 --> 02:53:11.627]  Of Pete Buttigieg and his partner or, you know, two guys in a hospital bed cradling a newborn baby.
[02:53:12.207 --> 02:53:16.089]  Like, we look at that and that is profoundly unnatural.
[02:53:17.014 --> 02:53:17.595]  And ungodly.
[02:53:17.615 --> 02:53:18.897]  They're pretending like they just had babies.
[02:53:19.197 --> 02:53:22.241]  Yeah, but you show that picture to the younger generation.
[02:53:23.122 --> 02:53:25.085]  How many of those kids say, yeah?
[02:53:26.454 --> 02:53:26.954]  And so what?
[02:53:27.174 --> 02:53:28.155]  Too many babies, yeah.
[02:53:28.435 --> 02:53:28.635]  Yeah.
[02:53:29.115 --> 02:53:34.276]  You know, because that's the degree to which they have normalized all of this.
[02:53:34.376 --> 02:53:45.980]  And as we move further and further away from God as a society and as a nation, what happens is that, you know, if you watch what the Marxists do, right, the Marxist strategy is they'll move the line.
[02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:46.920]  They'll just keep pushing.
[02:53:47.140 --> 02:53:50.621]  They'll pick it up and they'll keep moving it, moving it, moving it up until they hit a wall.
[02:53:51.181 --> 02:53:54.743]  And that wall is the people, that wall is you, right?
[02:53:54.823 --> 02:53:57.684]  And you say, no, no, no, wait a minute, what's going on here?
[02:53:58.044 --> 02:54:01.205]  But what they do, Alex, they never move back.
[02:54:01.925 --> 02:54:03.246]  They hold the line.
[02:54:03.866 --> 02:54:10.229]  And then the moment that your attention is diverted, you're worried about something else, they move it forward again and again and again.
[02:54:10.309 --> 02:54:14.250]  In an information war, that term is known as fractionalization, right?
[02:54:14.611 --> 02:54:17.672]  They start to get you used to something in tiny little increments.
[02:54:18.412 --> 02:54:21.774]  And you start to look over time where that has taken us.
[02:54:22.254 --> 02:54:28.256]  And that's a real worry for me as a mother and just as a decent human being.
[02:54:28.296 --> 02:54:29.617]  They're moving the overton window.
[02:54:30.197 --> 02:54:31.198]  They definitely are.
[02:54:31.298 --> 02:54:32.018]  But here's the good news.
[02:54:32.038 --> 02:54:33.098]  Not in a good direction.
[02:54:33.279 --> 02:54:38.641]  When I read the Carnegie and Ford endowment documents that are public, plus the ones I've been shown that are secret and I'm not supposed to talk about.
[02:54:40.364 --> 02:54:41.964]  The reason they hate me and hate you too.
[02:54:42.104 --> 02:54:42.925]  Here's a pro tip.
[02:54:42.965 --> 02:54:45.146]  If you want to keep something secret, don't tell Alex Jones.
[02:54:46.647 --> 02:54:48.067]  No, I'm not saying where the secret came from.
[02:54:50.509 --> 02:54:55.111]  They're so pissed because we moved the Overton window back and now they say, Oh my God, Alex Jones is now mainstream.
[02:54:55.751 --> 02:54:59.193]  So what we talk about is the truth, but they try to make it radical and evil.
[02:54:59.453 --> 02:55:07.397]  If we're not ashamed of our strongest leaders telling the truth and the normalization of it, we're actually normalizing normalization and moving it back right now.
[02:55:07.437 --> 02:55:08.418]  That's why they're in full panic mode.
[02:55:08.438 --> 02:55:08.918]  Does that make sense?
[02:55:09.278 --> 02:55:11.239]  Alex, how much do they hate me for doing that?
[02:55:11.739 --> 02:55:12.899]  How much do they hate me?
[02:55:13.300 --> 02:55:15.921]  I was the face of 60 Minutes.
[02:55:16.001 --> 02:55:21.403]  I was the future of the greatest news program ever, ever created.
[02:55:21.423 --> 02:55:22.143]  The Golden Child.
[02:55:22.423 --> 02:55:22.743]  Yes!
[02:55:23.223 --> 02:55:26.724]  Washington Post, New York Times, Vogue Magazine, Glamour Magazine.
[02:55:26.745 --> 02:55:27.465]  That's a good question.
[02:55:27.505 --> 02:55:32.507]  What made you, because you were never bad, but I've seen the documentaries you're in, when did you start to wake up?
[02:55:32.527 --> 02:55:33.307]  What was the shift like?
[02:55:34.249 --> 02:55:40.133]  Well, I mean, when I got, you know, smashed in the face with a hammer for my Benghazi reporting.
[02:55:40.493 --> 02:55:41.854]  I mean, that's effectively what happened.
[02:55:41.874 --> 02:55:51.420]  That's when I discovered media matters for America and, you know, and just how evil these people are and how infiltrated political operatives and propagandists were across the media.
[02:55:51.460 --> 02:55:52.440]  I mean, I really have no idea.
[02:55:52.460 --> 02:55:53.081]  Well, that's what I found.
[02:55:53.141 --> 02:55:56.003]  Your intimidation, day one, wakes people up who aren't cowards.
[02:55:56.363 --> 02:55:57.384]  You weren't just aware.
[02:55:57.764 --> 02:55:58.624]  You weren't fully aware.
[02:55:58.644 --> 02:56:01.446]  So when they tried to intimidate you, that didn't intimidate you.
[02:56:01.486 --> 02:56:02.547]  That made you investigate more.
[02:56:03.097 --> 02:56:07.941]  No, I mean, Alex, I did what I have done since I was 17 years old.
[02:56:07.981 --> 02:56:09.302]  I'm 53 years old now.
[02:56:09.802 --> 02:56:12.324]  I followed the facts wherever they led me.
[02:56:12.404 --> 02:56:17.909]  I never thought about whether it was going to be good for the Republicans or bad for the Democrats or something like that.
[02:56:17.929 --> 02:56:21.332]  It never entered into my head and people may find that hard to believe.
[02:56:21.412 --> 02:56:25.855]  I can't help you if you find it hard to believe because it's the truth and there's only one truth, right?
[02:56:26.196 --> 02:56:28.497]  But so when I was doing that, you know, I just,
[02:56:29.338 --> 02:56:29.618]  I think?
[02:56:59.538 --> 02:57:01.239]  No, it doesn't work like that.
[02:57:01.679 --> 02:57:16.027]  And, you know, then you go forward to the Trump election and you realize, wait a minute, this whole thing when they said that, you know, the people, that the one place where all of us are equal, where that counts equally, is when you cast your vote, right?
[02:57:16.107 --> 02:57:22.030]  Your vote, my vote, doesn't, it's no different to, you know, Obama's vote, Biden's vote, Trump's vote, it all counts the same.
[02:57:22.591 --> 02:57:24.912]  Except, what were they really saying?
[02:57:25.272 --> 02:57:26.713]  They were saying, no, that's a lie.
[02:57:27.253 --> 02:57:28.314]  That was just theater.
[02:57:28.614 --> 02:57:31.397]  We said that because it sounded nice, but we didn't mean it.
[02:57:31.957 --> 02:57:35.520]  You, the people, you're too stupid to choose your own leaders.
[02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:36.301]  We know better.
[02:57:36.721 --> 02:57:38.683]  So we can be whoever, right?
[02:57:38.763 --> 02:57:40.305]  It's not defined by the color of your skin.
[02:57:40.325 --> 02:57:42.607]  They want you to believe that it is, but it isn't.
[02:57:43.047 --> 02:57:43.948]  We know better.
[02:57:44.068 --> 02:57:48.172]  If I had a penny for every time I heard a journalist say that the audience was stupid,
[02:57:48.652 --> 02:57:49.193]  Well, you're ignorant.
[02:57:49.373 --> 02:57:50.074]  You're not dumb.
[02:58:05.092 --> 02:58:06.334]  You just haven't learned about it.
[02:58:06.614 --> 02:58:20.368]  But your ability to understand it, when you have journalists who stand up and tell the truth, and they do it, you know, with skill and discipline, because that's what we're supposed to have, and they do it with knowledge, you can reach anybody.
[02:58:21.169 --> 02:58:28.692]  If you tell someone a story in a meaningful way that's accurate, that's the art of what we did at 60 Minutes when we did it properly.
[02:58:29.052 --> 02:58:32.294]  The problem is now they do it, but they don't have any bowls when they do it, right?
[02:58:32.514 --> 02:58:33.114]  On No.
[02:58:33.134 --> 02:58:35.235]  69 is exposing organ harvesting 20 years ago.
[02:58:35.655 --> 02:58:36.736]  They wouldn't do any of that now.
[02:58:37.478 --> 02:58:37.959]  Hell no.
[02:58:38.759 --> 02:58:39.260]  Hell no.
[02:58:39.340 --> 02:58:44.105]  They're just, you know, when I was attacked, that was a message to everyone who stayed on that program.
[02:58:44.605 --> 02:58:47.268]  If you want to survive, don't do what she did.
[02:58:47.728 --> 02:58:49.129]  Don't go outside of the narrative.
[02:58:49.590 --> 02:58:52.553]  You know, they have a system of control.
[02:58:53.193 --> 02:58:54.975]  And that system is driven by fear.
[02:58:55.315 --> 02:58:55.836]  That's the thing.
[02:58:55.876 --> 02:58:57.878]  Well, they've got to be upset now that you're bigger than ever.
[02:58:58.599 --> 02:58:59.660]  So it's beautiful.
[02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:01.842]  And she's hosting the Alex Jones Show tomorrow.
[02:59:02.884 --> 02:59:03.806]  I finally made it.
[02:59:03.826 --> 02:59:05.269]  We made it.
[02:59:05.329 --> 02:59:05.710]  We made it.
[02:59:05.730 --> 02:59:06.191]  We love you.
[02:59:06.491 --> 02:59:07.674]  I've been a big fan for a long time.
[02:59:08.094 --> 02:59:08.956]  I remember my grandfather.
[02:59:10.120 --> 02:59:18.464]  He's been dead about 15 years, but I remember sitting in his house with my grandmother watching you on 60 Minutes and thinking, wow, that's an amazing journalist right there.
[02:59:18.504 --> 02:59:19.604]  So it's great to have you here.
[02:59:19.844 --> 02:59:21.865]  So I got a few of these Trump clips from his press conference.
[02:59:22.285 --> 02:59:22.986]  Let's play Trump.
[02:59:23.006 --> 02:59:24.686]  The president, he was taken away from Joe Biden.
[02:59:25.047 --> 02:59:26.867]  He had the right to run.
[02:59:26.887 --> 02:59:27.448]  That's true.
[02:59:27.468 --> 02:59:31.309]  This was an undemocratic coup, just like everything else we've seen.
[02:59:31.409 --> 02:59:32.250]  Trump is right to say this.
[02:59:32.290 --> 02:59:32.590]  Here it is.
[02:59:33.274 --> 02:59:40.678]  Vice President who is the least admired, least respected, and the worst vice president in the history of our country.
[02:59:41.259 --> 02:59:43.240]  The most unpopular vice president.
[02:59:44.341 --> 02:59:53.426]  And because of political reasons or because of being politically correct, even though she never received a vote.
[02:59:53.466 --> 02:59:55.127]  Don't forget, she was the first one defeated.
[02:59:56.112 --> 02:59:59.253]  As I remember it, because I watched it very closely, but she was the first one.
[02:59:59.273 --> 03:00:01.113]  She never made it to Iowa the first day.
[03:00:01.133 --> 03:00:02.354]  She never made it to Iowa.
[03:00:03.034 --> 03:00:04.694]  She was the first one that was defeated.
[03:00:05.555 --> 03:00:07.295]  She was the nastiest to him.
[03:00:07.355 --> 03:00:12.257]  She was nasty with the calling him a racist and the school bus and all of the different things.
[03:00:12.677 --> 03:00:14.057]  She was very nasty to Biden.
[03:00:14.777 --> 03:00:17.078]  And shockingly, he appointed her
[03:00:18.456 --> 03:00:20.237]  Asked her to serve as vice president.
[03:00:20.277 --> 03:00:24.199]  Well, uh, I don't know if he's happy about that decision right now.
[03:00:24.279 --> 03:00:25.119]  This was taken away.
[03:00:25.159 --> 03:00:38.446]  The presidency was taken away from Joe Biden and I'm no Biden fan, but I'll tell you what, from a constitutional standpoint, from any standpoint you look at, they took the presidency away and people were saying he lost after the debate.
[03:00:38.466 --> 03:00:39.106]  He couldn't win.
[03:00:39.126 --> 03:00:44.629]  Well, I don't know that that's true necessarily, but whether he could win or he couldn't win, he had the right to run.
[03:00:45.501 --> 03:00:46.201]  And they took it away.
[03:00:46.241 --> 03:00:48.302]  They said they're going to use the 25th Amendment.
[03:00:48.322 --> 03:00:49.302]  They're going to hit you hard.
[03:00:49.383 --> 03:00:50.443]  Either we can do it the nice.
[03:00:50.563 --> 03:00:54.965]  I heard I know exactly because I know a lot of people on the other side, believe it or not.
[03:00:55.885 --> 03:01:00.107]  And they said, we'll do it the nice way or we'll do it the hard way.
[03:01:01.167 --> 03:01:03.368]  And he said, all right.
[03:01:04.341 --> 03:01:07.503]  So that, I mean, they've really taken, what they've done is pretty incredible.
[03:01:08.504 --> 03:01:09.825]  Trump's really making a key point here.
[03:01:10.225 --> 03:01:13.267]  Steal the election from him, try to take him on the ballot, remove Biden.
[03:01:13.307 --> 03:01:15.869]  They're really showing that they're totalitarian colors.
[03:01:16.749 --> 03:01:18.310]  You remember the movie Wag the Dog?
[03:01:18.690 --> 03:01:19.351]  Yeah, excellent.
[03:01:19.731 --> 03:01:20.732]  Isn't that what we're looking at?
[03:01:20.932 --> 03:01:21.292]  It is.
[03:01:21.552 --> 03:01:21.732]  Right?
[03:01:21.833 --> 03:01:22.833]  It's exactly that.
[03:01:23.213 --> 03:01:30.838]  This really kind of exposes their operations, which usually happen behind a wall of, you know, media cover, right?
[03:01:30.919 --> 03:01:32.159]  But now they- No, that's the key.
[03:01:32.199 --> 03:01:33.000]  The mask is off.
[03:01:33.922 --> 03:01:34.182]  Yes.
[03:01:34.683 --> 03:01:48.116]  I think we're just seeing in plain sight now what has always been there, but it's been harder for us to identify because they were much more skilled and adept at keeping it from us.
[03:01:49.517 --> 03:01:53.119]  I want to play a clip about Trump talking about Elon Musk, which is true.
[03:01:53.759 --> 03:01:58.441]  Folks, I'm not some Elon boaster, but I judge three by three.
[03:01:58.501 --> 03:01:59.962]  He's devastating them.
[03:02:00.402 --> 03:02:01.963]  He is a maverick with what he's doing.
[03:02:02.383 --> 03:02:04.604]  And Trump points out that Elon Musk endorsed me.
[03:02:05.004 --> 03:02:06.045]  It wasn't easy to do.
[03:02:06.205 --> 03:02:08.026]  He is courageous and he is.
[03:02:08.066 --> 03:02:08.526]  Here's a clip.
[03:02:09.352 --> 03:02:09.712]  Yeah, sure.
[03:02:09.912 --> 03:02:11.033]  So Elon called me.
[03:02:11.854 --> 03:02:13.595]  As you know, he endorsed me full-throated.
[03:02:13.995 --> 03:02:14.836]  Great endorsement.
[03:02:14.956 --> 03:02:16.177]  I respect Elon a lot.
[03:02:16.197 --> 03:02:16.997]  He respects me.
[03:02:18.098 --> 03:02:21.180]  And not easy for him to endorse, to be honest with you.
[03:02:21.200 --> 03:02:24.563]  You know, it takes courage to endorse people.
[03:02:25.183 --> 03:02:27.665]  Many people have courage, and many people don't.
[03:02:27.685 --> 03:02:28.545]  He does have courage.
[03:02:29.186 --> 03:02:33.609]  And Elon endorsed me, and he asked me whether or not I'd do a show on Monday, and I think it's going to be Monday night.
[03:02:35.033 --> 03:02:38.575]  And I believe he's the host of the show, so it'll be very interesting.
[03:02:38.595 --> 03:02:39.856]  A lot of people are talking about it.
[03:02:39.876 --> 03:02:40.457]  I look forward to it.
[03:02:40.757 --> 03:02:42.018]  That'll be done on Monday night.
[03:02:44.999 --> 03:02:46.440]  So, yeah, this is gonna be huge.
[03:02:46.500 --> 03:02:47.841]  I mean, Elon is all in now.
[03:02:47.881 --> 03:02:48.782]  This is very exciting.
[03:02:50.387 --> 03:02:54.871]  Well, Elon Musk, I mean, really is leading the way on multiple fronts right now.
[03:02:54.991 --> 03:02:57.893]  His lawsuit against Garm, right?
[03:02:58.193 --> 03:03:08.061]  The globalist sort of advertising cabal that has been behind many of these shadow campaigns to stop anyone getting advertisers.
[03:03:08.081 --> 03:03:08.821]  The BlackRock ESG.
[03:03:09.542 --> 03:03:18.565]  I mean, Musk leading the way on that and funding the lawsuits for people who cannot fund their own lawsuits.
[03:03:19.025 --> 03:03:23.847]  This has been very significant because lawfare is a misuse of the legal system.
[03:03:24.987 --> 03:03:26.388]  You know whom I'm talking to.
[03:03:26.988 --> 03:03:30.509]  But Laura, I can't keep track of all the good stuff Elon's doing.
[03:03:30.529 --> 03:03:31.610]  It's like it's all good.
[03:03:32.170 --> 03:03:35.911]  And I'm not going to sit here and go, I'm holier than thou, you must be secretly evil.
[03:03:36.311 --> 03:03:38.052]  No, they hate him.
[03:03:38.092 --> 03:03:44.453]  They're criminally coming after him in the EU and the UK and Brazil and Australia.
[03:03:44.693 --> 03:03:49.374]  I mean, he's devastating them all because he's finally, I already knew this from inside people, I'll leave it at that.
[03:03:49.975 --> 03:03:51.555]  He said, they took my son and cut his dick off.
[03:03:51.895 --> 03:03:53.676]  I'm trying to be gross, but I mean, that's what he said.
[03:03:53.896 --> 03:03:54.636]  They murdered my son.
[03:03:55.256 --> 03:03:57.577]  That was his Rubicon moment.
[03:03:57.597 --> 03:03:58.357]  He was like,
[03:03:59.477 --> 03:03:59.897]  I'm done.
[03:04:00.357 --> 03:04:06.460]  Okay, so I will say that if anyone hasn't heard Elon tell that story, he does it a lot better than you.
[03:04:06.540 --> 03:04:06.820]  He does.
[03:04:06.860 --> 03:04:08.041]  I cut right in the chase.
[03:04:08.501 --> 03:04:09.942]  It's tear jerking.
[03:04:10.322 --> 03:04:15.204]  No, if you haven't heard Elon Musk talk about that, you really need to hear it.
[03:04:15.924 --> 03:04:18.125]  And I apologize for boiling it down to a gross level.
[03:04:18.185 --> 03:04:21.467]  I'm just saying, there's a level for any man.
[03:04:21.727 --> 03:04:24.209]  He probably wouldn't care about you bullying a doctor.
[03:04:24.229 --> 03:04:24.849]  I understand, yeah.
[03:04:24.969 --> 03:04:25.810]  He probably wouldn't care.
[03:04:26.070 --> 03:04:28.952]  But I just say, I urge people to go and look up that clip.
[03:04:28.972 --> 03:04:30.193]  Well, there's a good chance he's listening right now.
[03:04:30.233 --> 03:04:31.214]  He listens every day.
[03:04:31.254 --> 03:04:33.356]  That's what I'm saying is, that's a Rubicon moment.
[03:04:33.396 --> 03:04:34.797]  I thought it was very revealing.
[03:04:34.957 --> 03:04:37.599]  And also, I have to be honest, I was very moved.
[03:04:37.679 --> 03:04:41.021]  And I feel the kind of thing with Elon because he's a fellow South African.
[03:04:41.702 --> 03:04:44.964]  And I remember the early days with Elon Musk.
[03:04:44.984 --> 03:04:47.106]  I remember when they sold PayPal.
[03:04:47.486 --> 03:04:49.107]  And do you know what he did, Alex?
[03:04:49.168 --> 03:04:50.048]  Do you know that story?
[03:04:50.068 --> 03:04:50.609]  I do, but tell it.
[03:04:51.429 --> 03:04:58.914]  Um, that was when he, uh, when he promised a million rand, because rand being the South African currency, to every single employee of his company.
[03:04:58.934 --> 03:05:01.615]  He made every single one of them a millionaire, including the tea lady.
[03:05:02.096 --> 03:05:04.617]  So, you know, the lady would come in from the townships and make tea.
[03:05:04.877 --> 03:05:07.379]  The guy who worked in the garden, the overnight security guard.
[03:05:07.779 --> 03:05:24.190]  I've never forgotten that about Elon Musk, and when I listen to him tell that story about his son, one, I felt, on a personal level, I felt angry for him, and just angry that these people have been able to do this to so many, and then on the other... There's a government for my kids, too.
[03:05:24.930 --> 03:05:25.650]  All of our kids.
[03:05:26.051 --> 03:05:27.531]  They're coming for all of our kids.
[03:05:27.571 --> 03:05:29.692]  And our children are under spiritual attack, too.
[03:05:30.073 --> 03:05:31.413]  Make no mistake about that.
[03:05:31.453 --> 03:05:32.394]  But think about this.
[03:05:32.754 --> 03:05:37.316]  Elon Musk is about as powerful an individual as you can get.
[03:05:37.797 --> 03:05:39.738]  And they still got to his kids.
[03:05:39.778 --> 03:05:42.999]  That was my point, is you think they'd be smart enough, let's not get his kid.
[03:05:43.059 --> 03:05:44.260]  No, they wanted that trophy.
[03:05:44.670 --> 03:05:52.677]  Yeah, but think about all the parents around this country who come under pressure from therapists and school administrators and doctors and hospitals.
[03:05:53.197 --> 03:05:57.621]  And they pass laws even in Colorado where they don't tell the parents they're luring your kid away.
[03:05:58.021 --> 03:05:58.342]  Yes!
[03:05:58.682 --> 03:05:59.443]  In fact, you know what?
[03:05:59.503 --> 03:06:02.125]  Here's something that I'm investigating right now.
[03:06:02.605 --> 03:06:05.168]  I was just contacted by someone who's working on this.
[03:06:05.548 --> 03:06:11.453]  It's an underground network, really, where they take trans kids away from their parents
[03:06:11.613 --> 03:06:12.573]  Oh, that's in Washington!
[03:06:12.913 --> 03:06:13.594]  And hide them!
[03:06:13.734 --> 03:06:14.694]  What state is it, Washington?
[03:06:14.934 --> 03:06:16.194]  Oh, I'm not going to say right now.
[03:06:16.214 --> 03:06:17.475]  It's a bunch of states.
[03:06:17.635 --> 03:06:21.816]  This is where they use furries, you know, these crazy people that dress up like furries.
[03:06:22.176 --> 03:06:25.817]  It's tied to the furries and the trans community, and they're luring these people away.
[03:06:25.837 --> 03:06:27.057]  It's pedophiles dressed up like animals.
[03:06:27.397 --> 03:06:27.917]  Come here!
[03:06:28.298 --> 03:06:30.098]  Your mommy won't be there, dear daddy.
[03:06:30.138 --> 03:06:31.138]  We're going to take care of you.
[03:06:31.178 --> 03:06:31.939]  It's a pedophile cult.
[03:06:31.959 --> 03:06:32.859]  Okay, I'm not doing that.
[03:06:33.219 --> 03:06:35.259]  You do that way too well.
[03:06:35.760 --> 03:06:36.660]  I do it way too well?
[03:06:36.800 --> 03:06:37.440]  I'm not doing it.
[03:06:38.140 --> 03:06:40.801]  I was not asking you to do a little furry dance.
[03:06:41.840 --> 03:06:43.241]  Just making sure we're clear on that.
[03:06:43.481 --> 03:06:45.242]  Did I ask you, Laura, to do a furry dance?
[03:06:45.302 --> 03:06:45.962]  No, you didn't.
[03:06:46.022 --> 03:06:47.683]  No, I've covered it.
[03:06:47.703 --> 03:06:48.744]  Yeah, you're right.
[03:06:49.284 --> 03:07:09.094]  I mean, literally, in Llano, Texas, okay, which is not far from where we're sitting right now, I had a woman come up to me, a mother, come up to me at a Lincoln-Reagan dinner I spoke at, and she told me that in the classrooms in Llano, Texas, they were having kids dress up as furries and partner and, you know, crawl around on all fours and be let on a leash.
[03:07:09.634 --> 03:07:10.195]  I'm not kidding.
[03:07:10.235 --> 03:07:10.875]  No, no, no, no.
[03:07:10.915 --> 03:07:12.256]  You know, I just saw that woman.
[03:07:12.476 --> 03:07:13.657]  The same woman came up to me.
[03:07:13.697 --> 03:07:22.604]  I did the Remnant Alliance event in Dallas, Texas, with all these pastors, and that woman was at the gala, and she came up to me, and I couldn't believe it.
[03:07:22.624 --> 03:07:23.825]  I said, how's it going in Leno?
[03:07:23.865 --> 03:07:24.966]  She said, it's worse than ever.
[03:07:25.486 --> 03:07:26.267]  No, no, I know.
[03:07:26.287 --> 03:07:30.590]  So what I'm saying is this classic, and this furry thing, I didn't even know about it until I researched it like five years ago.
[03:07:31.010 --> 03:07:32.691]  That's in The Shining.
[03:07:32.911 --> 03:07:34.312]  It's another level of insanity.
[03:07:34.613 --> 03:07:37.255]  It's how the pedophiles dress up like furries to do it.
[03:07:37.595 --> 03:07:38.856]  This is how they're recruiting the kids.
[03:07:39.116 --> 03:07:43.441]  And they're taking your children away and they're hiding them in these underground networks.
[03:07:43.762 --> 03:07:49.829]  They passed a law last year in Washington to take children and put them in these and not tell the parents where they are.
[03:07:49.869 --> 03:07:50.370]  It's incredible.
[03:07:50.450 --> 03:07:52.973]  In Vermont, they say that they can vaccinate your kids at school.
[03:07:53.273 --> 03:07:55.676]  They don't have to have your permission and they don't have to tell you.
[03:07:55.836 --> 03:07:57.016]  The cult wants your children.
[03:07:57.036 --> 03:07:57.997]  Here's Trump.
[03:07:58.017 --> 03:07:58.377]  Okay, wait.
[03:07:58.417 --> 03:08:01.077]  So just the one thing about Elon that I want to say.
[03:08:01.118 --> 03:08:03.438]  The one part is that personal part with Elon Musk.
[03:08:03.858 --> 03:08:11.981]  But the other part about it is, imagine where we would be today if Twitter had stayed in the hands of the people running it before.
[03:08:12.001 --> 03:08:12.741]  I'm very thankful.
[03:08:12.761 --> 03:08:13.741]  We'd be in a bad position.
[03:08:14.201 --> 03:08:15.221]  We'd be in a much worse position.
[03:08:15.241 --> 03:08:16.862]  By the way, Laura, I'm not doing the furry thing with you.
[03:08:18.834 --> 03:08:21.997]  If you take away guns, she wants to take away everyone's gun.
[03:08:22.017 --> 03:08:23.678]  If you take away guns, can't do it.
[03:08:39.372 --> 03:08:41.193]  Because people need the guns for protection.
[03:08:41.693 --> 03:08:44.774]  Now, entertainment they wanted, hunting, you know, different things.
[03:08:44.854 --> 03:08:48.015]  But they need weapons for protection in this country.
[03:08:48.535 --> 03:08:50.996]  People live out in the woods and they're not going to have a gun.
[03:08:51.876 --> 03:08:58.678]  If you look at some countries, I don't want to get them in trouble, but some countries have actually gone the opposite way.
[03:08:58.718 --> 03:09:01.919]  They had very strong gun laws and now they have gone the opposite way.
[03:09:02.737 --> 03:09:09.278]  Where they allowed people to have guns, where in one case they encouraged people to go out and get guns, and crime is down 29%.
[03:09:09.819 --> 03:09:16.460]  And remember this, what is the toughest gun law in the United States?
[03:09:17.100 --> 03:09:17.700]  Chicago.
[03:09:19.361 --> 03:09:24.162]  On July 4th, 117 people were shot and 17 died.
[03:09:24.882 --> 03:09:29.783]  The toughest gun laws in the United States are in the city of Chicago, you know that.
[03:09:30.987 --> 03:09:33.389]  They had 117 people shot.
[03:09:33.849 --> 03:09:35.410]  Afghanistan does not have that.
[03:09:36.591 --> 03:09:41.515]  Afghanistan, by the way, was the lowest point in the history of our country, in my opinion.
[03:09:42.296 --> 03:09:48.821]  That was the worst embarrassment to the history of this country, and I say Putin would not have gone into Ukraine.
[03:09:49.665 --> 03:09:49.905]  I think?
[03:10:10.077 --> 03:10:11.258]  But I had a strong talk with him.
[03:10:11.898 --> 03:10:17.602]  For 18 months, not one American soldier was shot at or killed.
[03:10:17.622 --> 03:10:18.943]  Alright, let's stop there.
[03:10:19.404 --> 03:10:30.692]  Since Laura mentioned this, here is the clip of him talking about what happened to his son, who he basically correctly says is his dad, as his real identity captured by the cult.
[03:10:30.992 --> 03:10:31.352]  Here it is.
[03:10:31.792 --> 03:10:36.736]  It happened to one of my older boys, where I was
[03:10:41.317 --> 03:10:47.820]  I was essentially tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys, Xavier.
[03:10:47.840 --> 03:10:53.203]  This was before I had really any understanding of what was going on.
[03:10:53.223 --> 03:10:57.185]  We had COVID going on, so there was a lot of confusion.
[03:10:57.205 --> 03:11:03.928]  And, you know, I was told Xavier might commit suicide.
[03:11:04.328 --> 03:11:06.489]  That was a lie right from the outset?
[03:11:06.910 --> 03:11:07.570]  Incredibly evil.
[03:11:08.422 --> 03:11:11.264]  And I agree with you that people that have been promoting this should go to prison.
[03:11:11.485 --> 03:11:22.334]  So I was, I was tricked into doing this, um, and, uh, you know, it wasn't explained to me that puberty blockers are actually just sterilization drugs.
[03:11:23.094 --> 03:11:32.122]  Um, so, um, anyway, uh, and so I lost my son, essentially.
[03:11:32.142 --> 03:11:36.786]  Uh, so, you know, they, uh, they call it deadnaming for a reason.
[03:11:38.150 --> 03:11:43.992]  Alright, so the reason it's called deadnaming is because your son is dead.
[03:11:45.413 --> 03:11:46.533]  So my son Xavier is dead.
[03:11:47.894 --> 03:11:49.154]  Killed by the woke wine virus.
[03:11:50.595 --> 03:11:51.575]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[03:11:52.055 --> 03:11:52.255]  Yeah.
[03:11:52.356 --> 03:11:53.896]  I can't imagine what that would be like.
[03:11:53.916 --> 03:11:56.337]  Yeah.
[03:11:57.517 --> 03:12:03.360]  So... Yeah, and there's lots of people in that situation now.
[03:12:03.380 --> 03:12:03.900]  Right.
[03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:04.640]  It's not pretty.
[03:12:05.040 --> 03:12:06.321]  And lots of demolished kids.
[03:12:07.383 --> 03:12:07.623]  Yes.
[03:12:08.624 --> 03:12:11.525]  Yeah, well, that's a good reason to be the final straw.
[03:12:11.545 --> 03:12:16.667]  All right, so let's... So I vowed to destroy the worldwide virus after that.
[03:12:16.687 --> 03:12:22.049]  Yeah, we're making some progress.
[03:12:22.650 --> 03:12:22.870]  Yeah.
[03:12:23.250 --> 03:12:28.292]  I mean, if I was the globalist, I wouldn't try to destroy the son of Elon Musk, but they just can't stop.
[03:12:28.312 --> 03:12:29.893]  And that was a prize, Laura.
[03:12:30.729 --> 03:12:31.650]  It just breaks your heart.
[03:12:31.810 --> 03:12:32.731]  It really breaks my heart.
[03:12:32.972 --> 03:12:38.418]  I think, I feel like I saw Elon Musk in that moment in a way I'd never seen him before.
[03:12:38.938 --> 03:12:41.361]  And you can just, um, you can feel his pain.
[03:12:41.501 --> 03:12:42.602]  You know why he's doing it now.
[03:12:43.464 --> 03:12:44.205]  You understand?
[03:12:44.585 --> 03:12:44.825]  Yeah.
[03:12:45.025 --> 03:12:48.027]  It really changes everything for, it would change everything for me.
[03:12:48.427 --> 03:12:54.772]  I had a lot of faith in him before that, but I did have some questions and I just feel like, I mean, I'm a mama bear man.
[03:12:54.852 --> 03:12:55.672]  I'm a mama bear.
[03:12:56.032 --> 03:13:03.377]  First and foremost, it is the most important thing in the world to me and I'll fight for your kids and for his as much as I will fight for mine.
[03:13:04.038 --> 03:13:06.399]  And I just think that these people truly are evil.
[03:13:06.459 --> 03:13:11.923]  When he says in that quiet voice, you know, that's when I vowed to destroy them and I'm making some progress.
[03:13:12.563 --> 03:13:12.744]  Wow.
[03:13:13.864 --> 03:13:15.525]  That's pretty, that's pretty bad.
[03:13:15.565 --> 03:13:17.586]  That's when I vowed to destroy them.
[03:13:19.367 --> 03:13:20.848]  And I'm making some progress.
[03:13:21.328 --> 03:13:22.689]  And that's what the left has to do.
[03:13:22.709 --> 03:13:23.409]  Satan is up again.
[03:13:24.010 --> 03:13:25.150]  War is a two-way street.
[03:13:26.151 --> 03:13:27.011]  It's a two-way street.
[03:13:28.492 --> 03:13:29.252]  It is a two-way street.
[03:13:29.312 --> 03:13:30.773]  And so, by the way, is technology.
[03:13:31.333 --> 03:13:33.935]  You know, they're using it against us, but we can use it against them.
[03:13:35.482 --> 03:13:37.463]  And that's what Elon Musk has been doing, right?
[03:13:37.523 --> 03:13:42.105]  He's been taking their tactics, their tools, and putting that back in the hands of the people.
[03:13:42.265 --> 03:13:42.946]  Let's go to break.
[03:13:43.366 --> 03:13:46.027]  Drew Hernandez is still going to take over to some great work, and then Owen Schroyer.
[03:13:46.047 --> 03:13:51.030]  I want you to finish up, help people find you, everything Laura Logan, and then we'll have Drew Hernandez.
[03:13:51.090 --> 03:13:53.691]  I apologize, he gets it sometimes the fourth hour I take over, he gets it.
[03:13:54.331 --> 03:13:56.972]  And he'll maybe host with me next week or something to take over the show too.
[03:13:56.992 --> 03:14:01.755]  But tomorrow, the first two hours, Laura Logan hosting InfoWars!
[03:14:01.935 --> 03:14:02.375]  Yes!
[03:14:06.550 --> 03:14:07.350]  Yeah!
[03:14:08.211 --> 03:14:09.091]  Nitric Boost.
[03:14:10.012 --> 03:14:11.353]  Turmeric 95.
[03:14:12.753 --> 03:14:15.715]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[03:14:16.636 --> 03:14:21.618]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[03:14:22.119 --> 03:14:29.263]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[03:14:29.823 --> 03:14:31.804]  They let us private label their products.
[03:14:31.824 --> 03:14:32.705]  That's why you've already heard of
[03:14:33.565 --> 03:14:34.626]  Body's Old Turmeric Formula?
[03:14:34.926 --> 03:14:37.388]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[03:14:37.448 --> 03:14:39.250]  This is just their brand of that.
[03:14:39.590 --> 03:14:42.513]  And so, it is available under Turmeric 95.
[03:14:43.293 --> 03:14:43.894]  That's the name.
[03:14:44.154 --> 03:14:50.639]  So, we're sold out of Body's, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated turmeric.
[03:14:50.860 --> 03:14:51.940]  Same thing with Nitric Boost.
[03:14:52.361 --> 03:14:53.982]  Nitric Boost came from this company.
[03:14:54.022 --> 03:14:56.024]  They even let us use their name.
[03:14:56.324 --> 03:14:57.325]  It's now our best seller.
[03:14:57.525 --> 03:14:58.526]  We sold out of our version.
[03:14:58.786 --> 03:15:00.227]  Their version has a white model.
[03:15:00.568 --> 03:15:01.949]  It's the exact same thing.
[03:15:02.469 --> 03:15:04.229]  You get it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:15:04.309 --> 03:15:06.890]  So check out InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:15:07.890 --> 03:15:09.731]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[03:15:09.951 --> 03:15:14.392]  It's the Alex Jones Show with Laura Logan, Derrick Hernandez, coming up live.
[03:15:14.412 --> 03:15:17.413]  All right, Laura, you're going to be hosting the first two hours tomorrow.
[03:15:17.453 --> 03:15:19.693]  We look forward to a Saturday and Sunday show.
[03:15:20.373 --> 03:15:23.154]  I'm called away for stuff I've got to deal with, but you're so gracious to do that.
[03:15:23.594 --> 03:15:24.774]  Fellow Texan here with us.
[03:15:25.274 --> 03:15:27.475]  Closing comments and how do people find your great work?
[03:15:28.442 --> 03:15:32.084]  So you can find me on X. My show is on there too.
[03:15:32.124 --> 03:15:33.524]  The rest of the story with Lara Logan.
[03:15:33.544 --> 03:15:35.365]  My handle is at Lara Logan.
[03:15:35.385 --> 03:15:43.409]  I'm also on Truth Social and Wimkin and Rumble and Locals and a few other places.
[03:15:44.529 --> 03:15:45.009]  Beautiful.
[03:15:45.049 --> 03:15:46.530]  Your closing comment about the state of the world?
[03:15:50.777 --> 03:15:55.219]  I would just urge people to think critically about everything.
[03:15:55.239 --> 03:15:57.340]  You don't have to take anything I say at face value.
[03:15:57.760 --> 03:15:58.681]  Challenge everything.
[03:15:59.021 --> 03:16:09.206]  You know, as I said to my son just the other day, I was explaining to him, because we went to the orthodontist and he was telling me all the reasons he didn't need to get braces and why he didn't have to listen to the orthodontist.
[03:16:09.246 --> 03:16:14.028]  And I was like, wow, you know, when I was a kid, the orthodontist said, you need braces, you got them.
[03:16:14.648 --> 03:16:15.529]  It's healthy.
[03:16:15.609 --> 03:16:16.149]  You've done well.
[03:16:16.449 --> 03:16:16.729]  Right.
[03:16:16.889 --> 03:16:19.411]  And so he said to me, Mom, you've got to question everything.
[03:16:19.851 --> 03:16:22.453]  And I thought that was quite extraordinary.
[03:16:22.473 --> 03:16:24.814]  It was a great reminder from my 15-year-old.
[03:16:25.274 --> 03:16:26.655]  Question everything.
[03:16:26.715 --> 03:16:27.396]  Challenge everything.
[03:16:27.436 --> 03:16:31.258]  Because the only thing that stands up to questioning is the truth.
[03:16:31.698 --> 03:16:33.980]  Lies need, they have no legs.
[03:16:34.360 --> 03:16:37.262]  They need more lies and more lies and more lies to keep them up.
[03:16:37.722 --> 03:16:41.105]  And what we're seeing right now is all the lies around us are crumbling.
[03:16:41.505 --> 03:16:49.410]  But if you want to get to the other side of this, and you want the truth to prevail, and there is only one truth, then you need to stand up.
[03:16:50.111 --> 03:16:50.851]  Beautifully said.
[03:16:50.871 --> 03:16:52.733]  Alright, Laura Logan, thank you so much.
[03:16:53.073 --> 03:16:54.274]  Drew Hernandez takes over now.
[03:16:56.952 --> 03:16:59.393]  All righty, thank you, Alex and the great Laura Logan.
[03:16:59.953 --> 03:17:00.973]  What's going on, InfoWarriors?
[03:17:01.013 --> 03:17:02.013]  My name is Drew Hernandez.
[03:17:02.133 --> 03:17:04.854]  I am your guest host for the remainder of the fourth hour.
[03:17:05.494 --> 03:17:25.080]  And I do want to kind of piggyback on this conversation when it comes to this insane, satanic, baphomet, LGBTQ, so-called trans kid agenda and really zero in on Tim Walz because I think people need to really understand, and I know the InfoWarriors get this, but when you take a look at someone like Tim Walz,
[03:17:25.820 --> 03:17:31.803]  Being propped up by the Democrat Party as America's coach or America's big gay dad.
[03:17:31.843 --> 03:17:42.129]  That's pretty much what they're spinning him off to be as if he's some kind of kind papa that could, anyone could just have their child sit on his lap and you could feel safe with him.
[03:17:42.729 --> 03:17:49.051]  Of course, these satanic Democrat pedophiles are going to prop up somebody as depraved and degenerate like Tim Walz.
[03:17:49.491 --> 03:17:51.712]  Now, Kamala Harris is a full-blown mental retard.
[03:17:51.772 --> 03:17:52.412]  We all get that.
[03:17:52.472 --> 03:17:53.312]  We all understand that.
[03:17:53.632 --> 03:17:58.314]  She's depraved as well, but this is exactly why she will not hold any press conferences.
[03:17:58.374 --> 03:18:01.375]  This is exactly why she will not address the media.
[03:18:01.395 --> 03:18:06.136]  This is why she doesn't want to have any type of press like that, because the campaign full well knows
[03:18:06.937 --> 03:18:15.269]  That they will receive bad press as a result because there are some very serious questions that will be and can be asked that will be used against her.
[03:18:15.289 --> 03:18:17.212]  They've kind of learned their lessons from Biden.
[03:18:17.972 --> 03:18:25.017]  When they were trying to cover it up entirely, having him talk to the press even for five seconds was totally turned against them and backfired.
[03:18:25.398 --> 03:18:35.586]  But when they decided to launch the coup led by Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to launch the 25th Amendment to threaten him, to pressure him to not step aside.
[03:18:35.746 --> 03:18:42.951]  But according to the letter that was dropped on President Biden's ex account on that Sunday afternoon, him to stand down.
[03:18:43.452 --> 03:18:46.394]  Those were the exact words, to stand down.
[03:18:46.434 --> 03:18:47.615]  That is how the deep state works.
[03:18:48.371 --> 03:18:53.805]  But again, Kamala Harris is an obvious threat because she's just as worse of a puppet as Joe Biden is.
[03:18:53.825 --> 03:18:55.790]  At least with Joe Biden, they had the excuse.
[03:18:56.937 --> 03:19:00.059]  That his age was causing his cognitive decline.
[03:19:00.399 --> 03:19:02.401]  But with Kamala Harris, they don't have any excuses.
[03:19:02.821 --> 03:19:18.031]  She's just a low IQ, retarded DEI hire that's been propped up because they need another puppet that's a bit younger to carry out their depraved, degenerate, disgusting agendas brought out and assigned by the New World Order that we see carried out every single day.
[03:19:18.071 --> 03:19:21.253]  So this brings me to Tim Walz, especially with this agenda.
[03:19:21.273 --> 03:19:23.094]  I think people really do need to take a look
[03:19:23.644 --> 03:19:27.827]  At how serious and how dangerous this individual will be.
[03:19:27.947 --> 03:19:29.449]  Now, Kamala will be a puppet.
[03:19:29.489 --> 03:19:40.277]  Let's say we get a President Kamala Harris, which will totally plunge this entire nation into chaos, free fall, economic chaos, cultural chaos.
[03:19:40.677 --> 03:19:43.039]  Our military will be depleted and destroyed.
[03:19:43.700 --> 03:19:46.302]  Our police departments will be depleted and destroyed.
[03:19:46.502 --> 03:19:48.103]  And they will install a police state.
[03:19:49.264 --> 03:19:51.526]  As a result, that's why they've been defunding the police.
[03:19:52.623 --> 03:19:55.524]  For the past couple years, because that's a regime installation.
[03:19:55.564 --> 03:20:02.907]  Get rid of the good guys, get rid of any good police officers, cause them to retire early, cause them to get out of the force.
[03:20:02.927 --> 03:20:04.627]  They're doing the same thing with the military.
[03:20:04.847 --> 03:20:08.829]  They're doing the same thing with the Border Patrol, because that's a regime installation.
[03:20:08.849 --> 03:20:12.630]  Defund the police, gut the Border Patrol, gut the military.
[03:20:12.670 --> 03:20:16.712]  That's not necessarily to create anarchy.
[03:20:17.112 --> 03:20:20.433]  That's to install their regime with an entire army
[03:20:21.517 --> 03:20:28.379]  Of degenerate pedophiles without a conscience that will carry out wicked orders against the citizens of its own country.
[03:20:28.699 --> 03:20:32.459]  If you don't believe me, take a look at exactly what's happening in Britain right now.
[03:20:32.860 --> 03:20:34.720]  They're just a few years ahead of us.
[03:20:35.760 --> 03:20:38.761]  So with that said, you'll have a Kamala Harris puppet.
[03:20:39.801 --> 03:20:44.742]  That's why she's being propped up as the first black girl president ever.
[03:20:45.182 --> 03:20:47.863]  And it's totally amazing and gay and everybody's happy, right?
[03:20:48.826 --> 03:21:01.375]  That's just the dangling, shiny thing that Democrats are so very good, they're masters of propaganda to get all their NPCs and retarded voters to just be amplified literally, not overnight, immediately, within an hour.
[03:21:01.515 --> 03:21:04.277]  They're very good at this, and you should not underestimate that.
[03:21:04.898 --> 03:21:07.260]  It's not that you shouldn't underestimate Kamala Harris.
[03:21:07.880 --> 03:21:08.921]  She's retarded.
[03:21:09.582 --> 03:21:10.503]  And everybody knows it.
[03:21:10.943 --> 03:21:14.146]  It's the machine behind Kamala Harris that you should not underestimate.
[03:21:14.807 --> 03:21:19.411]  And I know a lot of people are pointing to the fact that Democrats are just giving free concerts.
[03:21:19.712 --> 03:21:25.397]  And that's why millions of people are all over social media amplifying the size of her rallies.
[03:21:25.457 --> 03:21:26.678]  And there's thousands of people there.
[03:21:27.018 --> 03:21:27.439]  Well, yeah.
[03:21:27.939 --> 03:21:29.781]  Because they've been doing that for a very long time.
[03:21:30.221 --> 03:21:32.263]  They're very good at that, and it's nothing new.
[03:21:32.683 --> 03:21:36.306]  Democrats just offering free anything for votes, and it works.
[03:21:37.086 --> 03:21:43.151]  And they have really, really, really sharpened their blade when it comes to running these types of campaigns.
[03:21:43.571 --> 03:21:46.814]  They've refined their ability to do this, and they're doing it right.
[03:21:46.834 --> 03:21:50.919]  Right now, and I know Republicans and right wingers and Trump supporters may look at this.
[03:21:50.999 --> 03:21:55.685]  And of course, you could criticize it and say, well, all those people are there for a free concert.
[03:21:56.105 --> 03:21:59.249]  True, but it works and it does gain votes.
[03:21:59.790 --> 03:22:00.450]  That's a fact.
[03:22:00.891 --> 03:22:01.852]  Democrats have been doing this
[03:22:01.852 --> 03:22:03.033]  They've been doing this for a long time.
[03:22:03.053 --> 03:22:03.733]  It's nothing new.
[03:22:04.114 --> 03:22:05.935]  And they're running the same thing with Kamala Harris.
[03:22:05.955 --> 03:22:09.157]  So don't underestimate the machine behind Kamala Harris.
[03:22:09.477 --> 03:22:15.602]  Because the moment you do, you become complacent, and you think you got the W in the bag, and that's when you lost.
[03:22:15.902 --> 03:22:16.923]  You don't lose in November.
[03:22:17.283 --> 03:22:26.009]  You lose when you convince yourself that the other side and the machine that are masters at propaganda to activate their NPCs within seconds are unbeatable.
[03:22:26.863 --> 03:22:28.964]  That is not the mentality we need right now.
[03:22:29.384 --> 03:22:41.229]  Everyone must remain vigilant at all costs, because we have a serious, deep state, New World Order, satanic, luciferian regime that is getting closer and closer and closer to another eight years.
[03:22:41.329 --> 03:22:42.970]  Mark my words, they rigged this election.
[03:22:43.310 --> 03:22:46.652]  You will have eight years of Kamala Harris in the White House.
[03:22:47.152 --> 03:22:47.412]  Yes.
[03:22:47.912 --> 03:22:56.316]  If you think America is bad now for all the normies out there that might be watching me on X at Real Alex Jones or at Infowars, or you can find me on X at Drew H. Live,
[03:22:57.034 --> 03:23:11.426]  I'll tell you this, if you think America has been a complete horror show for the past four years under Biden and Kamala Harris, well, just picture that for another eight years and beyond with a President Kamala Harris.
[03:23:11.686 --> 03:23:14.568]  All of a sudden, magically, things are gonna change and get better.
[03:23:14.608 --> 03:23:20.573]  When she's been the VP, she's been in the White House with Joe Biden for the past four years.
[03:23:20.613 --> 03:23:22.755]  Now, all of a sudden, it's magically gonna change.
[03:23:23.775 --> 03:23:24.336]  This is why
[03:23:25.347 --> 03:23:29.972]  Her campaign is not pointing to anything within her record the past four years.
[03:23:30.032 --> 03:23:38.460]  If you pay attention and you use your brain for any normies out there, if you really take a look at what this campaign is doing, isn't it traditionally
[03:23:41.249 --> 03:23:52.996]  The most effective way to campaign is to point to your most recent record, especially if you are the first black girl female vice president of the United States.
[03:23:53.296 --> 03:23:58.879]  Well, what has the first black girl female president of the United States done the past four years?
[03:23:59.300 --> 03:23:59.700]  Nothing.
[03:24:00.402 --> 03:24:05.744]  And the Harris campaign can't even point to a damn thing the past four years because she's a low IQ diversity hire.
[03:24:05.924 --> 03:24:16.027]  That's a retard that laughs at everything and can't have a conversation with the mainstream media without having the fear that everyone's gonna view her for the retard diversity hire that she actually is.
[03:24:16.287 --> 03:24:17.007]  What am I saying?
[03:24:17.328 --> 03:24:21.649]  What I'm saying is that her own campaign can't
[03:24:22.509 --> 03:24:33.998]  They literally can't point to anything she's accomplished for the past four years of the first black girl VP because she's done nothing but cause destruction to this nation with Joe Biden.
[03:24:35.319 --> 03:24:36.300]  Tag team together.
[03:24:39.082 --> 03:24:45.167]  And they can't even campaign on that for her to be the first black girl female president, because she's a total disaster.
[03:24:46.448 --> 03:24:48.490]  But again, she's a puppet.
[03:24:49.190 --> 03:24:51.412]  And again, this brings me to Tim Walz.
[03:24:52.279 --> 03:24:54.320]  Cuz Obama's running the show, that's very clear.
[03:24:54.600 --> 03:24:56.962]  Obama led the coup against Joe Biden.
[03:24:57.022 --> 03:25:02.185]  President Trump made that very clear today in his press conference in Mar-a-Lago, in case you missed it.
[03:25:02.525 --> 03:25:06.247]  You can go find the clips on my ex, go to at Drew H Live, you can follow me over there.
[03:25:06.267 --> 03:25:09.609]  But President Trump made it very clear.
[03:25:09.689 --> 03:25:11.230]  He actually defended Joe Biden.
[03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:14.792]  He said, the presidency was stolen from Joe Biden.
[03:25:15.333 --> 03:25:15.573]  Why?
[03:25:16.034 --> 03:25:30.864]  Because the Democrats staged a coup led by Barack Obama and President Trump even name dropped Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and Kamala Harris all in unison together to remove Joe Biden from the race for another four years.
[03:25:30.905 --> 03:25:43.354]  Now you and I know very clearly that Joe was incapable of another four years, but still nobody voted for Kamala Harris as the president for the nomination of the DNC.
[03:25:44.238 --> 03:25:55.862]  And they're calling this democracy because democracy is synonymous with communism and globalism in the mind of a Democrat or a leftist or a psychotic unit party operative that is destroying the West currently as I speak.
[03:25:57.923 --> 03:26:00.984]  And so with that said, we know that Barack Obama is leading the charge.
[03:26:01.604 --> 03:26:10.647]  It's the reason why Joe Biden was pressured to stand down because they were going to threaten the 25th Amendment against him to declare him incompetent to carry out his
[03:26:13.374 --> 03:26:15.816]  Literal president duties.
[03:26:16.156 --> 03:26:17.617]  I mean, and we've all known this, right?
[03:26:18.037 --> 03:26:24.682]  But the fact of the matter is, is will Kamala be in charge as a president?
[03:26:25.462 --> 03:26:26.303]  I would say no.
[03:26:27.043 --> 03:26:27.724]  She's a puppet.
[03:26:27.784 --> 03:26:30.726]  She will do as she's told in the eyes of the public.
[03:26:31.626 --> 03:26:33.688]  It's like a smoke screen.
[03:26:33.708 --> 03:26:35.369]  Kamala Harris will be a smoke screen.
[03:26:36.069 --> 03:26:36.950]  She'll be the one at the forefront
[03:26:40.709 --> 03:26:43.170]  That Democrats will want everyone to be focused on.
[03:26:43.410 --> 03:26:45.971]  The first black female president did this.
[03:26:46.311 --> 03:26:48.872]  The first black female president did this.
[03:26:49.172 --> 03:26:52.613]  The first black female president did, it'll continue, it'll continue.
[03:26:52.993 --> 03:26:56.814]  More homosexuals, degenerates with their genitals out at the White House.
[03:26:57.274 --> 03:26:59.355]  Okay, they'll probably have children out in the open.
[03:26:59.375 --> 03:27:01.656]  It's straight Sodom and Gomorrah levels right now, okay?
[03:27:02.156 --> 03:27:02.836]  That's where we're at.
[03:27:03.797 --> 03:27:04.977]  And that'll be at the forefront.
[03:27:05.917 --> 03:27:07.798]  But the one actually carrying things out,
[03:27:08.775 --> 03:27:09.636]  Will be Tim Walz.
[03:27:09.836 --> 03:27:11.677]  And I think this is why he was selected.
[03:27:11.737 --> 03:27:14.359]  It's a bad selection, especially with the stolen valor.
[03:27:16.620 --> 03:27:24.366]  Clearly stolen valor attempt at running as the vice president to capture the White House.
[03:27:24.486 --> 03:27:27.488]  I mean, it is stolen valor, but he's attempting to ride that wave.
[03:27:28.354 --> 03:27:31.617]  To the White House, that is not a good look for Democrats.
[03:27:31.917 --> 03:27:35.941]  And you have US veterans from both sides, Republicans or Democrats.
[03:27:36.562 --> 03:27:42.968]  And there's tons of footage out there of veterans confronting his staff offices.
[03:27:43.692 --> 03:27:47.795]  Questioning why he's claiming to be a combat veteran in Afghanistan.
[03:27:47.815 --> 03:27:49.275]  That is stolen valor.
[03:27:49.376 --> 03:27:50.296]  You do not do that.
[03:27:50.316 --> 03:27:51.817]  It does not matter who you are.
[03:27:51.837 --> 03:27:54.239]  It doesn't matter if you're a Republican or a Democrat.
[03:27:54.879 --> 03:28:01.183]  Every single veteran that is out there that hears me will tell you this is not a Republican or a Democrat issue.
[03:28:01.443 --> 03:28:02.484]  We don't care who you are.
[03:28:02.604 --> 03:28:03.304]  And I'm not a veteran.
[03:28:03.364 --> 03:28:11.189]  I'm just saying this is all I've been hearing from veterans on comment sections on my shows, people calling in on my show, DMs I've been getting.
[03:28:11.829 --> 03:28:12.710]  They all keep saying,
[03:28:14.109 --> 03:28:16.891]  This Republican Democrat is not an issue to us.
[03:28:17.571 --> 03:28:28.397]  It is your fake claims of serving as a combat veteran when you never saw combat, when there are men and women that have died out there, okay?
[03:28:28.837 --> 03:28:40.824]  You are LARPing, you are fake, you are lying about something that is clearly not for you, a self-sacrifice that you weren't anywhere near.
[03:28:41.384 --> 03:28:42.585]  So get that out of your mouth.
[03:28:43.749 --> 03:28:45.891]  Stolen valor is actually against the law.
[03:28:46.491 --> 03:28:47.252]  And so that's huge.
[03:28:47.812 --> 03:28:50.294]  That's a bad look for Democrats, but Democrats are liars.
[03:28:50.314 --> 03:28:51.015]  What do you expect?
[03:28:51.495 --> 03:28:56.259]  Of course, everything about this is astroturfed, but it doesn't mean it's not effective.
[03:28:56.359 --> 03:29:01.663]  This is where Republicans, right-wingers, and Trump supporters need to really, really pull your mind out of that.
[03:29:02.203 --> 03:29:06.847]  Pull your mind out of, okay, what they're doing is fake and astroturfed.
[03:29:08.328 --> 03:29:09.129]  It's not gonna work.
[03:29:09.429 --> 03:29:13.312]  Stop thinking that way, because that's not the way to think right now.
[03:29:14.261 --> 03:29:15.663]  Yes, it's astroturfed.
[03:29:16.003 --> 03:29:16.884]  Yes, it's fake.
[03:29:17.325 --> 03:29:18.807]  Yes, they're being propped up.
[03:29:19.167 --> 03:29:20.208]  Yes, they're lying.
[03:29:20.549 --> 03:29:21.430]  Yes, it works.
[03:29:23.292 --> 03:29:23.693]  It works.
[03:29:24.372 --> 03:29:25.693]  This is the art of propaganda.
[03:29:25.713 --> 03:29:32.879]  You tell a lie, you tell it frequent, you tell it bigger and bigger and bigger, and eventually the masses are gonna believe it, especially their own base.
[03:29:33.159 --> 03:29:37.442]  The real question right now is how do moderates, how do independents feel about all of this?
[03:29:37.942 --> 03:29:46.669]  And I think the election will determine that if we actually do have a free and fair election, which I'm not quite too confident we will, but we've seen some developments in some different states.
[03:29:47.550 --> 03:29:50.212]  In Nevada, cleaning up the voting rolls, huge.
[03:29:50.872 --> 03:29:51.353]  Georgia,
[03:29:52.387 --> 03:29:59.290]  I believe allowing poll watchers to be inside watching the status of the machines and the vote.
[03:29:59.330 --> 03:30:06.413]  So there have been some movements, ballot chasers being recruited and deploying across the United States for the 2024 election.
[03:30:06.713 --> 03:30:09.154]  There have been some changes in some states.
[03:30:09.714 --> 03:30:20.238]  But the big question is, will the too-big-to-rig theory be enough to beat out the millions of illegals, the machines that are not being watched, the mass mail-in ballot drops?
[03:30:21.895 --> 03:30:26.037]  Millions of dead that will be voting outside of states that have not cleaned up their voter rolls.
[03:30:27.117 --> 03:30:32.319]  The big question is, will the too-big-to-rig theory be correct to beat out all of that?
[03:30:33.019 --> 03:30:40.301]  We're talking about, conservatively, maybe 15 to 20 million illegals voting in this next election.
[03:30:42.642 --> 03:30:44.623]  So, I don't know, you do the math.
[03:30:45.943 --> 03:30:47.064]  You have your own opinion on that.
[03:30:48.204 --> 03:30:49.164]  But back to Tim Walz.
[03:30:50.145 --> 03:30:50.505]  For any
[03:30:51.417 --> 03:30:59.684]  Father out there, or mother, grandmother, or grandfather, or if you're an aunt or an uncle, you have a niece or a nephew, right?
[03:31:00.624 --> 03:31:03.567]  Even if you don't have kids, children should always be a concern to you.
[03:31:04.267 --> 03:31:09.711]  Even if you don't have children, you don't have a niece, you don't have a nephew or a grandson, whatever.
[03:31:09.731 --> 03:31:17.257]  That doesn't mean you do not have the right to be concerned about the children in your society.
[03:31:17.938 --> 03:31:20.460]  You damn well should be concerned at all costs.
[03:31:21.175 --> 03:31:24.498]  Especially when you have these homosexual pedophiles coming after your children openly.
[03:31:25.098 --> 03:31:29.121]  Just straight up pride rallies with homosexuals with their genitals out and children right there.
[03:31:29.141 --> 03:31:32.904]  And they're just dancing and they're helicoptering with their penises as kids walk by.
[03:31:33.085 --> 03:31:34.246]  And they call that progression.
[03:31:34.266 --> 03:31:35.507]  They call it pride.
[03:31:35.527 --> 03:31:37.889]  And they call it real freedom to express yourself.
[03:31:38.589 --> 03:31:40.391]  Literally naked in front of little children.
[03:31:40.411 --> 03:31:41.131]  Because that's great.
[03:31:41.171 --> 03:31:41.672]  It's liberal.
[03:31:41.732 --> 03:31:42.332]  It's awesome.
[03:31:42.352 --> 03:31:43.013]  And we feel free.
[03:31:44.204 --> 03:31:44.404]  No.
[03:31:44.724 --> 03:31:45.925]  That's called Sodom and Gomorrah.
[03:31:45.945 --> 03:31:46.965]  That's called perversion.
[03:31:47.265 --> 03:31:51.046]  The Bible has addressed this, and he's forewarned not to accept homosexuality.
[03:31:51.466 --> 03:31:55.647]  And if the nation doesn't want to agree with God, well then, accept your destruction.
[03:31:55.667 --> 03:31:56.808]  It's as simple as that.
[03:31:57.388 --> 03:31:58.008]  It's as simple as that.
[03:31:58.028 --> 03:32:06.570]  If you don't want to listen to God, then accept your destruction of your families, of your children, of your society, of your entire civilization.
[03:32:06.810 --> 03:32:07.370]  Accept it.
[03:32:07.450 --> 03:32:09.831]  You don't want to side with God on this subject?
[03:32:10.111 --> 03:32:11.812]  Then accept your destruction.
[03:32:12.412 --> 03:32:12.732]  Period.
[03:32:13.328 --> 03:32:19.571]  This comes down to God's word, not Drew's word, not any talk show's word, God's word himself on this subject.
[03:32:19.951 --> 03:32:24.253]  That's why you're seeing so much perversion, because we've tolerated perversion up until this point.
[03:32:25.253 --> 03:32:30.576]  And there is no piece of policy, and there is no human idea that's gonna put this thing to sleep.
[03:32:31.256 --> 03:32:33.457]  It is only the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[03:32:34.492 --> 03:32:44.322]  Obeyed by the masses and his word obeyed by the masses that will address this sexual perversion that has been tolerated for far too long in this country.
[03:32:44.682 --> 03:32:45.883]  Drew, you sound really radical.
[03:32:46.163 --> 03:32:46.504]  Fine.
[03:32:46.904 --> 03:32:48.586]  Yes, I'm a born again Christian.
[03:32:48.606 --> 03:32:50.167]  I'm a Christ supremacist.
[03:32:50.628 --> 03:32:51.489]  I'm not a liberal.
[03:32:52.556 --> 03:32:55.018]  Okay, newsflash, I'm not a liberal.
[03:32:55.078 --> 03:32:59.020]  You want to call me a far right Christian extremist, whatever, fine.
[03:32:59.100 --> 03:32:59.821]  Give me the crown.
[03:32:59.921 --> 03:33:00.541]  I'll put it on.
[03:33:00.661 --> 03:33:01.261]  I'll wear that.
[03:33:02.002 --> 03:33:05.964]  I will gladly accept that title because I believe in my Bible.
[03:33:06.224 --> 03:33:11.147]  And I believe my Bible determines the reality around me as civilization should go.
[03:33:11.407 --> 03:33:17.191]  And if you disagree with that and you call yourself a Christian, you might want to examine yourself as to whether you really are in the faith.
[03:33:18.852 --> 03:33:19.592]  That's a side note.
[03:33:20.093 --> 03:33:20.633]  Tim Walz.
[03:33:21.417 --> 03:33:28.158]  With the remaining time I have, any sane individual out there needs to really understand how dangerous this guy is.
[03:33:28.178 --> 03:33:32.179]  This guy's worse than Kamala Harris and Joe Biden combined.
[03:33:32.899 --> 03:33:34.799]  And he will be running the show because he's not dumb.
[03:33:34.859 --> 03:33:35.519]  He's very smart.
[03:33:35.559 --> 03:33:36.300]  He's very intelligent.
[03:33:36.320 --> 03:33:36.780]  He's cunning.
[03:33:37.980 --> 03:33:42.901]  And I think that's exactly why Barack Obama wanted him.
[03:33:44.401 --> 03:33:50.082]  Because they need someone that is intelligent, but that is depraved, wicked, and void of morality.
[03:33:51.232 --> 03:33:52.052]  That is Tim Walz.
[03:33:52.472 --> 03:33:52.932]  He's smart.
[03:33:52.973 --> 03:33:53.573]  He's not stupid.
[03:33:53.593 --> 03:33:54.493]  He's not a stupid man.
[03:33:55.353 --> 03:33:58.574]  Do not look at someone like Tim Walz as stupid.
[03:33:58.614 --> 03:34:00.114]  Don't underestimate somebody like that.
[03:34:00.595 --> 03:34:01.375]  He's intelligent.
[03:34:01.615 --> 03:34:02.295]  He's smart.
[03:34:02.855 --> 03:34:04.456]  But he's evil.
[03:34:05.476 --> 03:34:11.778]  That is a combination that is a total, total nightmare for society.
[03:34:11.978 --> 03:34:14.078]  And I think that is why he was selected.
[03:34:14.398 --> 03:34:16.639]  Traditionally, I mean, you'll hear Roger Stone say, right?
[03:34:16.999 --> 03:34:19.780]  Traditionally, politicians, left and right, they'll pick VPs that
[03:34:20.447 --> 03:34:24.749]  Don't necessarily do much for them, but they don't hurt them.
[03:34:24.969 --> 03:34:26.190]  Just pick someone that's safe.
[03:34:26.650 --> 03:34:28.531]  I don't think Democrats are thinking that way.
[03:34:29.652 --> 03:34:32.073]  Democrats don't run campaigns like that right now in 2024.
[03:34:32.614 --> 03:34:36.456]  Everything about Democrats is let's prop them up like rock stars.
[03:34:36.496 --> 03:34:37.876]  They're like the next messiahs.
[03:34:37.916 --> 03:34:38.797]  They should be worshipped.
[03:34:38.997 --> 03:34:42.659]  Let's brand them in Hollywood, and they are to be embraced like that.
[03:34:42.799 --> 03:34:46.381]  And that is how we communicate with our voters, emotionally connecting with them.
[03:34:47.372 --> 03:34:51.274]  That's what Democrats are doing with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz right now.
[03:34:51.374 --> 03:34:55.737]  However, to sane-minded individuals, we still have to point these things out.
[03:34:55.757 --> 03:34:56.597]  And I'll do it real quick.
[03:34:56.617 --> 03:34:57.938]  You want to know insane this guy is?
[03:34:57.958 --> 03:35:01.119]  You want to know how depraved and wicked this guy is?
[03:35:01.580 --> 03:35:03.741]  Whether you're a Christian or not, let me ask you this.
[03:35:04.261 --> 03:35:10.965]  This guy signs bills, signs away legislation in Minnesota as the governor, right?
[03:35:12.366 --> 03:35:16.728]  For abortion, for a woman to have the right to have an abortion at any
[03:35:17.680 --> 03:35:32.490]  Any point in the pregnancy, first, second, third trimester, all the way up into nine months, hours before the baby's born, if the mother decides to neutralize that pregnancy and neutralize that baby, she has the right to do that.
[03:35:33.210 --> 03:35:36.412]  And I believe that abortion is murder at conception, okay?
[03:35:36.533 --> 03:35:38.614]  That's my Christian belief.
[03:35:38.874 --> 03:35:41.996]  Excuse me, I believe it's murder because life begins at conception.
[03:35:42.957 --> 03:35:44.598]  And any point in the pregnancy is murder.
[03:35:45.729 --> 03:35:52.434]  But however, I will point out to you how extreme and insane, all abortion is extreme and insane.
[03:35:52.914 --> 03:36:00.860]  But the fact that he legislates this way that a woman could neutralize and execute her baby even at nine months, if she chose, changed her mind.
[03:36:01.580 --> 03:36:10.687]  And even to take it a step further, he even legislated that if the abortion fails and the baby survives,
[03:36:11.624 --> 03:36:16.307]  That doctors, the clinics, or wherever she gets the abortion, it's infanticide, it's murder.
[03:36:17.167 --> 03:36:21.950]  That if the baby survives, that doctors are not obligated by law to keep the baby alive.
[03:36:23.251 --> 03:36:28.133]  They could just let the baby sit there and just die, suffer, and nobody will ever know.
[03:36:28.173 --> 03:36:29.714]  You wanna know why no one will ever know?
[03:36:30.375 --> 03:36:38.139]  Because he even took it a step further and legislated that doctors, medical personnel, nurses, anybody involved, clinics that carry out these abortions,
[03:36:38.954 --> 03:36:41.896]  If the baby survives, they don't even have to report it.
[03:36:41.936 --> 03:36:46.059]  They are not obligated to report any of this to the government, the state at all.
[03:36:46.339 --> 03:36:49.201]  It is all done in secret under the table.
[03:36:50.202 --> 03:36:51.883]  And taxpayers fund it all.
[03:36:52.623 --> 03:36:54.104]  Straight up murder out in the open.
[03:36:54.805 --> 03:36:55.765]  And they don't even have to.
[03:36:55.805 --> 03:36:56.546]  They're not obligated.
[03:36:56.566 --> 03:37:03.731]  This goes against everything taught ever for doctors and nurses and medicine for thousands of years.
[03:37:04.451 --> 03:37:05.292]  You are obligated
[03:37:06.016 --> 03:37:09.998]  To keep human life living at all costs, right?
[03:37:11.139 --> 03:37:12.160]  But no, not with babies.
[03:37:12.880 --> 03:37:14.001]  Because babies, we don't care.
[03:37:14.561 --> 03:37:15.602]  It's human sacrifice.
[03:37:15.642 --> 03:37:16.943]  It's Molech, okay?
[03:37:17.003 --> 03:37:22.106]  Worship, incinerating babies, offering up human sacrifice, dismembering our babies.
[03:37:22.866 --> 03:37:23.967]  That's who Tim Walz is.
[03:37:24.007 --> 03:37:26.248]  That's how Tim Walz has already governed.
[03:37:26.589 --> 03:37:27.789]  He's not promising to do that.
[03:37:27.949 --> 03:37:29.070]  He's already done that.
[03:37:29.951 --> 03:37:32.192]  He's created Minnesota to be a sanctuary state.
[03:37:33.126 --> 03:37:36.308]  Where so-called trans kids can flee their parents.
[03:37:37.089 --> 03:37:42.552]  And they can go to Minnesota, they can get their genitals cut off, the state will pay for it and carry it out without telling the parents.
[03:37:42.653 --> 03:37:45.074]  Yes, Tim Walz has signed off on all of this.
[03:37:46.235 --> 03:37:53.420]  And by the way, it's so extreme that he even signed off that the state can, in an emergency,
[03:37:55.210 --> 03:38:00.135]  So-called temporary, they can take temporary emergency custody of your child.
[03:38:00.655 --> 03:38:08.603]  If your child flees from you because you're a bigot parent that doesn't want to chop their genitals off and pump them up with drugs and puberty blockers, they can flee to Minnesota.
[03:38:08.923 --> 03:38:17.391]  The state will take emergency custody of your child and carry out these operations and not even have to tell you or consent with you.
[03:38:19.315 --> 03:38:21.897]  And this can go anywhere.
[03:38:21.937 --> 03:38:23.458]  They accuse you of child abuse.
[03:38:23.478 --> 03:38:28.081]  Well, the state takes custody of your child because you are risking your child of suicide.
[03:38:28.121 --> 03:38:34.126]  Wouldn't you rather have a living daughter than a dead son if your son claims to be a little girl?
[03:38:34.506 --> 03:38:35.206]  What's wrong with you?
[03:38:35.266 --> 03:38:36.067]  That's child abuse.
[03:38:36.647 --> 03:38:37.888]  This is how radical this guy is.
[03:38:38.629 --> 03:38:39.329]  And I'll end here.
[03:38:39.349 --> 03:38:46.034]  There's a book called Gender Queer that depicts homosexual acts of oral sex of teenage boys.
[03:38:47.015 --> 03:38:48.816]  And this is shown to little kids in school.
[03:38:50.157 --> 03:38:55.078]  And it's called, well, technically they call it homosex.
[03:38:55.919 --> 03:38:58.579]  Really, it's homosexual education for children.
[03:38:59.460 --> 03:39:00.580]  It's pornography for kids.
[03:39:02.120 --> 03:39:05.821]  And there have been calls from parents to ban these books out of schools.
[03:39:08.442 --> 03:39:11.143]  And you wanna know what Tim Walz's reaction was to that?
[03:39:11.843 --> 03:39:12.883]  He said that's ridiculous.
[03:39:13.163 --> 03:39:23.267]  And by the way, also, there was legislation originally that was signed that made it hard for pedophiles to identify that as their sexual orientation as to why they're attracted to children.
[03:39:23.867 --> 03:39:32.490]  He redacted that very legislation out of the original legislation to make it easier for pedophiles to hide behind sexual orientation.
[03:39:33.390 --> 03:39:33.850]  Sick stuff.
[03:39:44.451 --> 03:39:52.519]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements.
[03:39:53.480 --> 03:39:57.264]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[03:39:57.704 --> 03:39:59.906]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[03:40:00.747 --> 03:40:06.173]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[03:40:07.228 --> 03:40:15.792]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[03:40:16.112 --> 03:40:17.973]  We had five companies making product for us.
[03:40:18.594 --> 03:40:23.116]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're in fours.
[03:40:23.816 --> 03:40:26.117]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts.
[03:40:27.098 --> 03:40:32.401]  We found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country, not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[03:40:33.221 --> 03:40:34.722]  And they said, listen, you know,
[03:40:35.936 --> 03:40:51.943]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[03:40:52.323 --> 03:40:58.986]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[03:41:00.066 --> 03:41:01.207]  We're good to go.
[03:41:11.989 --> 03:41:20.093]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[03:41:20.173 --> 03:41:26.796]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[03:41:26.956 --> 03:41:29.437]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[03:41:29.617 --> 03:41:31.518]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[03:41:31.738 --> 03:41:41.506]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[03:41:42.146 --> 03:41:44.548]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[03:41:44.588 --> 03:41:45.649]  Take Turmeric 95.
[03:41:47.330 --> 03:41:54.032]  Turmeric 95 is called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[03:41:54.152 --> 03:41:59.814]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[03:41:59.914 --> 03:42:08.437]  So, bought these Ultimate Turmeric Formulums, sold out at mfulworthstore.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[03:42:08.477 --> 03:42:10.558]  So that's why Mfulworth's MD is such an amazing line.
[03:42:12.188 --> 03:42:25.471]  Because of the bankruptcy, attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[03:42:25.971 --> 03:42:30.352]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[03:42:30.412 --> 03:42:35.053]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[03:42:35.373 --> 03:42:38.814]  At InfoWarsStore.com from InfoWarsMD.
[03:42:38.954 --> 03:42:41.315]  So, I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[03:42:41.415 --> 03:42:42.015]  It's amazing.
[03:42:42.155 --> 03:42:43.075]  It's super high quality.
[03:42:43.135 --> 03:42:44.996]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[03:42:45.116 --> 03:43:05.102]  Nitric Boost, good night's sleep, Joint Relief Max is amazing, Nerve Renew, Prostate Support, Probiotic Formula, CBD Full Spectrum, 25 milligram gummies, CBD Full Spectrum, 10 milligram gummies works great, Turmeric 95, Libido RX, Better Mood, Mushroom Max for mental clarity and your immune system, Superfood Greens, Ageless
[03:43:05.162 --> 03:43:05.442]  Thank you.
