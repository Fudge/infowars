[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:08.033]  They know exactly what they're doing, and it is self-assembling nanotech in the body.
[00:00:08.453 --> 00:00:17.737]  And we were finding this stuff decades ago, but right when they rolled out the COVID hysteria four years ago, we got all the literature, and they were keeping secret what was in the Pfizer shots and the Moderna shots, the rest of it.
[00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:24.996]  But whistleblowers actually released, it's later been confirmed, what was in it, and it was a giant test.
[00:00:25.036 --> 00:00:29.280]  They were changing thousands of times at Moderna and Pfizer, run by the Pentagon.
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.401]  They were just front companies.
[00:00:31.982 --> 00:00:35.445]  What they were putting in it, they were testing all sorts of stuff.
[00:00:36.406 --> 00:00:40.209]  Ebola, Marburg, all sorts of bird flus.
[00:00:42.734 --> 00:01:14.164]   Just to see, because humans are so tough, and most of these diseases we can't get, they were putting zoological viruses that had been weaponized into us, hoping they could find some people that would actually hit, and then they could send in their medical teams and, oh, we want to study the body, take the body away to exsanguinate it, suck all the juices out, and then try to study How to weaponize that against people, like that clip I played 10 times last week of Gates going, yeah, we're just messing around.
[00:01:14.244 --> 00:01:15.886]  We don't know what this mRNA is going to do.
[00:01:16.747 --> 00:01:18.829]  We're just putting it in you to test it as guinea pigs.
[00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:20.650]  We just shoot it right in the kid's veins.
[00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:29.159]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.592]  The scam starts small over the generations.
[00:01:36.752 --> 00:01:38.174]  Evil grows slowly.
[00:01:39.475 --> 00:01:46.381]  But as people begin to bow down to it and not recognize it, it grows like a cancer.
[00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:49.563]  And then it starts moving at light speed.
[00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:52.626]  And that's where we are today.
[00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:59.392]  All right.
[00:02:00.473 --> 00:02:01.734]  I'm about to hit you and hit you hard.
[00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:05.603]  This, uh.
[00:02:08.385 --> 00:02:11.966]  The stack of news right here is next level evil.
[00:02:14.508 --> 00:02:15.828]  And we're going to break some news here.
[00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.729]  As well.
[00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.893]  Because it's one thing to have something in the news is one thing you hear about something to have a whistleblower on the inside at Pfizer.
[00:02:26.894 --> 00:02:28.294]  It was very close to coming on the show.
[00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.995]  He's already sent us all his documents and information.
[00:02:31.036 --> 00:02:31.696]  We've just got to.
[00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:38.975]  Change the voice so that they don't kill him.
[00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:42.035]  Like you've seen with the Boeing whistleblowers.
[00:02:42.055 --> 00:02:46.096]  Of course, since they killed two of them, one with a gunshot to the head, the other with a bioweapon.
[00:02:49.757 --> 00:02:51.918]  10 more have stepped into the place saying we're not intimidated.
[00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:57.880]  That's kind of an interesting little parable for the people doing this that they thought we were intimidated.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.600]  We were asleep.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.640]  Now we're awake.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.520]  We're not intimidated.
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.841]  At least a lot of us aren't.
[00:03:01.861 --> 00:03:02.461]  We're pissed off.
[00:03:03.743 --> 00:03:07.749]  So, Gregory's put out a five-minute report.
[00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:13.577]  As you watch his last dozen reports or so on the subject, it's all congruent.
[00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.361]  It all proves what's happening.
[00:03:17.662 --> 00:03:31.329]  And so, there's new documents coming out all the time and new emails in Congress that, oh, Fauci calls it gain of function, and they created the COVID virus in 2014 with Obama at the University of Texas in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.470]  You're like, yeah, we've been hearing this for four years, Alex, we know about it.
[00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.070]  Hell, we got clips of me talking about 2014.
[00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.591]  It was a big scandal.
[00:03:36.931 --> 00:03:39.232]  Scientists at the university said, you're making weaponized...flu.
[00:03:39.092 --> 00:03:53.572]   flu, SARS, mixing HIV and flu and and and cold viruses and bird flu together.
[00:03:51.715 --> 00:03:52.756]  What are you doing?
[00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:53.376]  This is illegal.
[00:03:54.297 --> 00:03:56.718]  It was in major newspapers everywhere in 2014, 2015.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.622]  And so we already know the story, but more has come out since then.
[00:04:03.662 --> 00:04:25.506]   Well, on the subject of graphene oxide and the lipid particles and how they've been designed to when they're put into 98.9 degrees of protein, which is your blood, they start growing.
[00:04:26.807 --> 00:04:29.730]  And they've been designed to create a matrix.
[00:04:32.332 --> 00:04:38.697]  And that's why all these coroners and pathologists around the world say we've never seen anything like it.
[00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:46.981]   You know, 30, 40 years some of these people have been working Top, you know, head of the German National Pathology Union said, we've never seen anything like this.
[00:04:47.402 --> 00:04:59.174]  The turbo cancers, the people die, and it's like, well, it's not like if you leave a soup on the stove, say a beef broth or, you know, cooking a beef rib.
[00:04:59.992 --> 00:05:01.093]  And you don't eat it, you forget to.
[00:05:01.133 --> 00:05:01.814]  You only eat part of it.
[00:05:02.054 --> 00:05:02.774]  You leave it on the stove.
[00:05:03.155 --> 00:05:05.157]  It cools down to 70 degrees.
[00:05:05.397 --> 00:05:07.739]  You get up in the morning and there's that fat at the top.
[00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:11.462]  And then the rib meat and then the carrots and stuff are down there.
[00:05:12.343 --> 00:05:12.983]  It's the same thing.
[00:05:13.043 --> 00:05:18.007]  It's not like you're living while there's this sludge as thick as is in the tumors.
[00:05:18.468 --> 00:05:25.114]  It's that when you died because it was already in your body and was causing heart attacks, then it separates out.
[00:05:26.158 --> 00:05:27.418]  And they go, what the hell?
[00:05:27.438 --> 00:05:39.182]  I mean, they're seeing at these mortuaries every day, something they never saw, where they'll just pull out of a carotid artery, some big old fat thing, half the size of a hot dog and two feet long.
[00:05:40.122 --> 00:05:41.062]  And you're like, how the hell?
[00:05:41.102 --> 00:05:41.903]  I've had the corners on.
[00:05:41.923 --> 00:05:45.464]  They're like, how the hell did this person even live?
[00:05:49.925 --> 00:05:52.626]  How did they, how did they do this?
[00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:59.794]  How did they survive this long?
[00:06:01.575 --> 00:06:03.417]  By the way, in the break, guys, give me a new clip.
[00:06:03.437 --> 00:06:04.277]  I've asked for a couple of days.
[00:06:04.317 --> 00:06:05.678]  This clip pops off constantly.
[00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:06.619]  The clip is broken.
[00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:08.240]  I can't do the show with it anymore.
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.440]  Okay.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.442]  It's just a constant, like every five minutes I'm fixing it.
[00:06:11.722 --> 00:06:12.423]  I'm like, can I have a new clip?
[00:06:12.443 --> 00:06:13.023]  It's like, I don't know.
[00:06:13.043 --> 00:06:13.844]  It's like this weird thing.
[00:06:13.864 --> 00:06:18.767]  Like, Bruno does a great job, but on certain things, like if it's key, maybe we don't have another clip.
[00:06:18.827 --> 00:06:20.909]  I'm just driving me nuts right now.
[00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:22.630]  So continuing here.
[00:06:25.894 --> 00:06:28.656]  My earpiece keeps falling out.
[00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:40.306]  The point is, is that they know exactly what they're doing, and it is self-assembling nanotech in the body.
[00:06:40.707 --> 00:06:50.015]  And we were finding this stuff decades ago, but right when they rolled out the COVID hysteria four years ago, we got all the literature, and they were keeping secret what was in the Pfizer shots and the Moderna shots and the rest of it.
[00:06:51.243 --> 00:06:57.267]  But whistleblowers actually released, it's later been confirmed, what was in it, and it was a giant test.
[00:06:57.287 --> 00:07:01.530]  They were changing thousands of times at Moderna and Pfizer, run by the Pentagon.
[00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:02.651]  They were just front companies.
[00:07:04.232 --> 00:07:07.694]  What they were putting in it, they were testing all sorts of stuff.
[00:07:08.655 --> 00:07:12.458]  Ebola, Marburg, all sorts of bird flus.
[00:07:14.986 --> 00:07:46.433]   Just to see, because humans are so tough, and most of these diseases we can't get, they were putting zoological viruses that had been weaponized into us, hoping they could find some people that would actually hit, and then they could send in their medical teams and, oh, we want to study the body, take the body away, to sanguinate it, suck all the juices out, and then try to study How to weaponize that against people like that clip I played 10 times last week of Gates going, yeah, we're just messing around.
[00:07:46.493 --> 00:07:48.073]  We don't know what this mRNA is going to do.
[00:07:48.994 --> 00:07:51.075]  We're just putting it in you to test it as guinea pigs.
[00:07:51.355 --> 00:07:52.915]  We just shoot it right in the kid's veins.
[00:07:56.837 --> 00:07:59.538]  So they're turning us into the biological factories.
[00:08:00.178 --> 00:08:05.821]  You hear all about how fruit and vegetables can be designed to grow pig protein or whatever they want.
[00:08:06.601 --> 00:08:08.902]  They're doing it to us, and the hospitals don't know.
[00:08:09.182 --> 00:08:16.304]  They just get an added bonus so they can say, hey, we'll take off half your bill for your dad that died, or your mom, or your brother, your sister, your cousin.
[00:08:16.904 --> 00:08:18.065]  You're the next of kin.
[00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:20.126]  Just sign here for medical study.
[00:08:20.486 --> 00:08:22.826]  Your dad will help with this, and we'll knock half your bill off.
[00:08:25.427 --> 00:08:27.708]  And then they take the body away, and they can suck it all dry.
[00:08:28.408 --> 00:08:36.091]  And just like they did at Wuhan with thousands of pigs, they would inject with these zoological viruses, because pigs are closest to humans, to see what would jump into us.
[00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:43.241]  And I could go on for a hundred hours about this, but I'm going to play the Gregory's report that just came out today.
[00:08:43.401 --> 00:08:46.103]  It's got to be his 13th, 14th report, because I went and looked today.
[00:08:46.163 --> 00:08:49.445]  He's done like 13 or 14 on nano stuff in the last four years.
[00:08:50.666 --> 00:08:51.167]  It may be more.
[00:08:51.207 --> 00:08:52.388]  I found like 13 or 14.
[00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:56.691]  And this is all confirmed in the literature.
[00:08:57.471 --> 00:08:58.752]  And he put all his reports together.
[00:08:58.772 --> 00:09:00.293]  You know, all the evidence is there.
[00:09:00.312 --> 00:09:03.472]  is there.
[00:09:03.472 --> 00:09:19.874]   So self-replicating nanobots found in both the vaxed and unvaxed Greg Reese, here's the report and then I'm going to go into all of this new information ahead of the next guest coming on next hour.
[00:09:20.234 --> 00:09:22.897]  And it'll take me about 15 minutes, 20 minutes to hit this.
[00:09:23.297 --> 00:09:27.821]  Then I'll hit all the border news and political news and the other stuff that's going on before the guest comes on.
[00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:30.543]  I'll probably go some of the fourth hour to hit this.
[00:09:30.583 --> 00:09:35.107]  But this is being done premeditatedly.
[00:09:36.514 --> 00:09:42.240]  And it is a fact that, yes, the so-called vaccinated are farms for prions.
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.441]  That's the protein in the arteries.
[00:09:43.461 --> 00:09:45.943]  Imagine what it's doing to your brain when that stuff grows in your brain.
[00:09:47.144 --> 00:09:52.089]  And now young people, millions, have what they call, you know, juvenile Alzheimer's suddenly.
[00:09:52.109 --> 00:09:53.190]  And they're like, well, it's no big deal.
[00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:58.656]  And cancer's off the chart, and life expectancy's plummeting, and population suddenly starts plummeting in the last few years.
[00:10:00.492 --> 00:10:07.138]  And it's all a giant project to test this on the public and find cures for themselves.
[00:10:07.898 --> 00:10:18.007]  And they send out certain hot batches as well to key areas that are way stronger because they want to kill people, but they also want to find who took the shot, who survived it.
[00:10:19.144 --> 00:10:20.704]  So not everybody gets the super deadly shots.
[00:10:21.165 --> 00:10:22.985]  They'll send them out key range finding.
[00:10:23.025 --> 00:10:23.805]  It's like a range finder.
[00:10:23.825 --> 00:10:25.946]  Before you shoot a deer at 500 yards, you've got a range finder.
[00:10:25.966 --> 00:10:28.127]  Yeah, I think that deer is about 500 yards.
[00:10:28.147 --> 00:10:28.487]  Let me test.
[00:10:28.967 --> 00:10:30.107]  Okay, it's 540 yards.
[00:10:30.127 --> 00:10:30.707]  I kind of guessed it.
[00:10:31.428 --> 00:10:31.888]  Hit the rifle.
[00:10:31.948 --> 00:10:32.728]  Click, click, click, click.
[00:10:32.828 --> 00:10:33.208]  All right.
[00:10:33.228 --> 00:10:34.229]  A little Coriolis effect.
[00:10:34.289 --> 00:10:35.889]  All right.
[00:10:36.649 --> 00:10:37.329]  Right in the heart.
[00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.970]  Oh, good.
[00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.530]  Good shot.
[00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:46.212]  So it's battlefield range finding or Green Berets lazing a target before F-16s or Predators swoop in and drop bombs.
[00:10:48.013 --> 00:10:48.773]  So everybody got a...
[00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:55.574]  Poison shot at some level, but it was a gradient of what you were injected with.
[00:10:57.835 --> 00:11:12.486]  Because they're range finding, and then, more importantly, if you survive when they gave you a hot shot, well, the hospital's got all your blood tests, it's got all your things they're selling, the biomedical companies, they don't tell you about, it's admitted.
[00:11:13.587 --> 00:11:27.778]  And you survive, they've got those bags of blood, they've got those samples, they've got those tests, and it's confirmed, it's coming out in the news, that whistleblower's coming on soon, who did survive hot matches, who were then contacted by the CDC and said, hey, we really want you to come in for some tests and things, and we'll pay you $10,000.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:34.003]  We just come in for a CAT scan, we come in to give us, you know, a couple bags of blood, and people go, sure, I want to help.
[00:11:34.724 --> 00:11:49.073]   And so you go into a CDC-approved place, they take blood, nurse has no idea what's going on, she's compartmentalized, he's compartmentalized, and They take it away and then they can sit there and look at how you survived what they just hit you with.
[00:11:52.176 --> 00:11:52.876]  This is dangerous.
[00:11:53.336 --> 00:12:08.336]  Here's Greg Raich's report.
[00:12:08.344 --> 00:12:17.052]  And in 2008, he said that humans would become infused with nanorobots, which would vastly improve the human body.
[00:12:17.072 --> 00:12:27.762]   If you go out, Even to 2045, that's only four decades from now, most of our intelligence of our human civilization will be non-biological.
[00:12:27.782 --> 00:12:29.624]  We're going to put this inside our bodies and brains.
[00:12:29.884 --> 00:12:43.596]   So we're going to become machines, but not... And if you say that, then people go, well, I don't want to become a machine, because they're thinking of machines As we knew them from the 19th century, which were much lesser than humans, and machines today are still lesser than humans.
[00:12:43.956 --> 00:12:53.643]  I'm talking about a new type of machine that's actually greater, more subtle, more supple, more intelligent, more creative, more beautiful than humans.
[00:12:53.843 --> 00:13:02.610]  In 2010, he interviewed Robert Freitas on the future of nanotechnology, who said that nanorobots could cure aging and death.
[00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:08.372]  Medical nanorobots really have the potential to extend human life more or less indefinitely.
[00:13:08.392 --> 00:13:12.253]  So what's your view about the role of death and do we need death?
[00:13:13.033 --> 00:13:14.874]  Death is something that is an end.
[00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:16.255]  It's an end to life.
[00:13:16.835 --> 00:13:17.835]  It's an end to progress.
[00:13:17.975 --> 00:13:18.815]  It's an end to thoughts.
[00:13:19.816 --> 00:13:21.236]  It's something to be cured.
[00:13:22.457 --> 00:13:24.758]  Aging is a disease.
[00:13:25.758 --> 00:13:26.838]  It's a curable disease.
[00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:31.774]   Nanomedicine is the cure for that disease.
[00:13:32.214 --> 00:13:41.058]  He said that this technology is expected to be deployed by 2020 and that laws will be in place to protect the public from its misuse.
[00:13:41.418 --> 00:13:50.582]  I expect that by the time nanorobots are deployed, which will be sometime perhaps in the 2020s or the 2030s, we will have a whole set of laws in place, regulations.
[00:13:51.102 --> 00:13:52.823]  There will be things you can and cannot do.
[00:13:53.343 --> 00:14:01.128]  The laws were never put in place, but the technology was patented and deployed to billions of people without their knowledge in 2020.
[00:14:01.568 --> 00:14:09.834]  We know this because several independent labs have confirmed the presence of this nanotechnology in the COVID vaccines.
[00:14:10.354 --> 00:14:13.116]  And Bill Gates recently admitted to this as well.
[00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:18.762]  Making the mRNA is really easy and really cheap and that's the magic of this thing.
[00:14:19.342 --> 00:14:24.768]  But there's no doubt in the next five years we can, you know, we just need to mess around.
[00:14:24.848 --> 00:14:28.952]  There's a lot of lipid nanoparticles and some are very self-assembly.
[00:14:29.833 --> 00:14:35.816]  Self-assembly and self-replication seem to be the same technology when it comes to nanorobots.
[00:14:36.197 --> 00:14:41.279]  And this was considered to be the greatest danger involved with the use of this technology.
[00:14:41.559 --> 00:14:43.360]  Self-replication causes disease.
[00:14:44.241 --> 00:14:50.564]  Nanorobots are inherently much stronger than biological systems being built of diamondoids.
[00:14:50.584 --> 00:14:58.389]  So if they self-replicate, that disease, quote-unquote, could be even a tougher problem than biological disease.
[00:14:59.549 --> 00:15:05.354]  So, first of all, what's the feasibility of self-replication in the nanotechnology world?
[00:15:05.874 --> 00:15:10.778]  As a general principle, you do not want to put self-replicating nanorobots inside the human body.
[00:15:11.539 --> 00:15:17.684]  I suppose not everybody agrees with me on that, but that is the way I think that we can best guarantee safety.
[00:15:18.545 --> 00:15:25.270]  If the robots, nanorobots, are able to replicate inside the human body, that means they are using some component of the human body as food.
[00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.891]  Stop there.
[00:15:26.111 --> 00:15:27.672]  And... Back it up ten seconds.
[00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:28.673]  Now.
[00:15:30.526 --> 00:15:31.927]  What do these nanobots do?
[00:15:32.007 --> 00:15:32.948]  They admit it's in there.
[00:15:33.448 --> 00:15:34.409]  It's self-replicating.
[00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:35.909]  It looks just like computer chips.
[00:15:35.929 --> 00:15:37.571]  We've covered this a hundred times at least.
[00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:39.812]  It grows throughout the whole body.
[00:15:39.832 --> 00:15:40.793]  It creates a sludge.
[00:15:43.314 --> 00:15:53.000]  They want to roll all this out, but they want to camouflage it by contaminating billions of people with it and just hiding it in plain view and getting the medical system that didn't know it was happening to go along with it.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.241]  So they've now been corrupted.
[00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:56.523]  See how smart this is from a satanic perspective?
[00:15:58.584 --> 00:15:59.445]  There they are 20 years ago.
[00:16:01.109 --> 00:16:03.069]  Predicting what they've now already done to us.
[00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.530]  They're going to tell us about this.
[00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:06.250]  They've done it.
[00:16:07.591 --> 00:16:11.331]  But they're not putting the jack in yet for the 5G.
[00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:12.332]  That's in the patents.
[00:16:12.392 --> 00:16:18.573]  This is just a mass test on the public to be able to see what works and what doesn't for themselves.
[00:16:18.913 --> 00:16:21.274]  It's raw research on the public.
[00:16:21.294 --> 00:16:21.614]  Continue.
[00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:27.894]  As a general principle, you do not want to put self-replicating nanorobots inside the human body.
[00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:34.798]  I suppose not everybody agrees with me on that, but that is the way I think that we can best guarantee safety.
[00:16:35.659 --> 00:16:45.066]  If the nanorobots are able to replicate inside the human body, that means they are using some component of the human body as food, and we don't want them to be doing that.
[00:16:46.046 --> 00:17:04.842]  In his 1986 book, Engines of Creation, Kim Eric Drexler wrote about what he termed the Grey Goo Scenario, a hypothetical catastrophic event caused by out-of-control, self-replicating nanotechnology which consumes the biomass of the host.
[00:17:05.382 --> 00:17:08.425]  And this is exactly what independent researchers are finding.
[00:17:09.699 --> 00:17:14.246]  It explains the large, so-called blood clots being found in the dead.
[00:17:14.827 --> 00:17:15.588]  And it's spreading.
[00:17:16.009 --> 00:17:19.895]  Evidence shows that the vaxxed are shedding this to the unvaxxed.
[00:17:20.396 --> 00:17:21.137]  How do we prevent...
[00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:29.273]  A terrorist or someone who's bent on destruction from creating such a self-replicating system.
[00:17:29.353 --> 00:17:33.155]  There will be some terrorist acts because that's what humans do, unfortunately.
[00:17:33.996 --> 00:17:40.479]  So what we're going to be needing in this era of nanofactories is something equivalent to the fire department.
[00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:49.223]  Hopefully the incidents will be very few, but we will have an emergency regime which is set up to deal with that type of event.
[00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:53.410]  Well, no.
[00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:54.671]  You don't have a fire department.
[00:17:54.711 --> 00:17:55.651]  You don't tell the public.
[00:17:55.711 --> 00:17:57.952]  You hit four billion people with it.
[00:17:58.873 --> 00:18:00.233]  Then it sheds onto others.
[00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:00.994]  Isn't as bad.
[00:18:01.014 --> 00:18:03.135]  It looks like there's ways to mitigate it.
[00:18:04.555 --> 00:18:06.336]  But the point is, you see what they did now?
[00:18:07.477 --> 00:18:08.097]  They don't wait.
[00:18:08.137 --> 00:18:08.717]  They don't ask.
[00:18:08.737 --> 00:18:09.678]  That's what Gates said.
[00:18:09.698 --> 00:18:12.819]  And that's what Fauci said five, six years ago on C-SPAN interviews.
[00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:14.820]  Oh, we're just going to blow up the old regime.
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:15.520]  No more testing.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.601]  We test on you live.
[00:18:16.641 --> 00:18:16.981]  Continue.
[00:18:18.237 --> 00:18:24.706]  So what we're going to be needing in this era of nanofactories is something equivalent to the fire department.
[00:18:24.986 --> 00:18:33.518]  Hopefully the incidents will be very few, but we will have an emergency regime which is set up to deal with that type of event.
[00:18:34.039 --> 00:18:39.061]  But the event is worldwide, and there is no agency set up to put out this fire.
[00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:49.525]  Our governments are not even discussing the problem, and the perpetrators are planning a second round of nanobot deployment with another fake pandemic.
[00:18:50.466 --> 00:18:55.287]  If we the people cannot unite and stand together now, then what exactly are we?
[00:18:56.368 --> 00:18:58.929]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:19:00.658 --> 00:19:03.220]  I posted that this morning on X at like 5 a.m.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.521]  I hope you share the video and sit real Alex Jones.
[00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:08.222]  Or you can roll over and die.
[00:19:08.603 --> 00:19:09.243]  Really, it's up to you.
[00:19:10.944 --> 00:19:11.204]  All right.
[00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:14.406]  So, we're living in an experiment.
[00:19:14.646 --> 00:19:15.486]  This is happening.
[00:19:15.667 --> 00:19:16.627]  There's no debating it.
[00:19:16.847 --> 00:19:17.247]  It's there.
[00:19:17.428 --> 00:19:17.968]  What are we going to do?
[00:19:19.449 --> 00:19:22.731]  Well, now they're rolling out the bird flu, the next leg, as we told you they would.
[00:19:25.312 --> 00:19:26.853]  Now, let's start drilling through this, okay?
[00:19:29.696 --> 00:19:31.717]  We get paid to vaccinate your children.
[00:19:31.757 --> 00:19:34.898]  Pediatrician reveals details of Big Pharma Payola scheme.
[00:19:35.599 --> 00:19:38.460]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars for every few hundred kids they inject.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.160]  It's all there.
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:39.761]  It's all public.
[00:19:39.781 --> 00:19:40.421]  You might want to read it.
[00:19:40.461 --> 00:19:41.442]  So you ask, why would they do it?
[00:19:41.462 --> 00:19:42.542]  They just get money.
[00:19:44.423 --> 00:19:50.126]  OGBYN doctor calls on attorneys to sue institutions that force dangerous COVID shots on babies and pregnant women.
[00:19:50.566 --> 00:19:55.768]  Upwards of 80% of the women in the first trimesters are having miscarriages when they take the shot.
[00:19:56.168 --> 00:19:57.009]  He's coming on next hour.
[00:19:58.763 --> 00:20:01.265]  Self-replicating nanobots found in both Vax and Unvax.
[00:20:01.305 --> 00:20:02.005]  That's the new report.
[00:20:04.326 --> 00:20:05.747]  Second class, now this is key.
[00:20:05.827 --> 00:20:09.489]  This is Der Spiegel, the most important, at least the New York Times of Germany.
[00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.590]  Second class medicine.
[00:20:11.631 --> 00:20:14.212]  Germans unhappy with alternative swine flu vaccine.
[00:20:14.552 --> 00:20:16.874]  Politicians were given a cleaner, better shot.
[00:20:17.454 --> 00:20:17.934]  This is from 2009.
[00:20:18.174 --> 00:20:20.836]  Point is, this goes on, this happens.
[00:20:21.656 --> 00:20:24.278]  I'm going to get to the breaking exclusive news here in a moment.
[00:20:26.319 --> 00:20:27.800]  And here it is, going live now.
[00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:30.840]  At InfoWars.com.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:31.921]  Story's already written.
[00:20:31.941 --> 00:20:33.022]  I've got a preview article here.
[00:20:34.803 --> 00:20:41.887]  Exclusive Pfizer whistleblower leaks company email offering separate and distinct COVID-19 vaccines for workers.
[00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:43.528]  And we don't just have it in the U.S.
[00:20:43.588 --> 00:20:44.009]  or England.
[00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:49.032]  We have documents and videos admitting it from the Senate in Australia.
[00:20:51.533 --> 00:20:55.774]  Now, the fact checkers, when this began to break two years ago, said, well, it's not true.
[00:20:56.634 --> 00:20:58.295]  They just didn't want to take away your shots.
[00:20:58.335 --> 00:20:59.575]  They just had some set aside.
[00:20:59.635 --> 00:21:05.997]  No, we have the company documents in multiple countries that it was a different shot altogether.
[00:21:06.017 --> 00:21:08.858]  Because how do they convince their employees?
[00:21:08.878 --> 00:21:09.598]  Don't take this.
[00:21:10.138 --> 00:21:10.898]  We got something else.
[00:21:11.098 --> 00:21:12.699]  It was sugar water.
[00:21:12.739 --> 00:21:13.499]  It was saline.
[00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:14.439]  It was salt water.
[00:21:15.599 --> 00:21:16.260]  People tested it.
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:16.660]  It was.
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:17.940]  I've got that document.
[00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:21.796]  We're going to go to break.
[00:21:21.816 --> 00:21:28.361]  I'm going to come back with the exclusive information inside emails, inside documents from Pfizer.
[00:21:28.381 --> 00:21:33.806]  You're going to see this information straight ahead.
[00:21:33.846 --> 00:21:34.486]  We're going to break.
[00:21:36.168 --> 00:21:38.089]  I cannot fight this fight without you.
[00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.993]  If you want to keep us on air, we can stay on air, but I'm going to need your support.
[00:21:42.813 --> 00:21:44.254]  Plus, I've got great products you need.

[00:22:28.523 --> 00:22:29.324]  We're talking 30 40% profit on food.
[00:22:31.638 --> 00:22:32.399]  And water filtration.
[00:22:32.419 --> 00:22:35.061]  So we're talking 20-30% when we do 10% off.
[00:22:35.081 --> 00:22:39.185]  That is a 10% off on food and water filtration is like 40% off.
[00:22:39.565 --> 00:22:41.206]  Okay, that is a big deal.
[00:22:41.347 --> 00:22:44.429]  Infowarstore.com, take advantage of that.

[00:23:35.742 --> 00:23:37.423]  We need to get ready now.
[00:23:37.823 --> 00:23:40.864]  People need to go to KEPM.com forward slash gold.

[00:23:51.628 --> 00:23:56.310]  In my opinion, you are insane if you don't get into silver right now and get some gold.
[00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.911]  And I wish I could do it.
[00:23:58.091 --> 00:23:59.131]  I'm under enemy attack.
[00:23:59.591 --> 00:24:00.151]  It's okay.
[00:24:00.191 --> 00:24:00.472]  It's fine.
[00:24:00.652 --> 00:24:11.576]  And I'm just looking at all of you wishing I was in the position you're in right now because I wish this wasn't the case, but I intellectually and spiritually know I'm 100% right.
[00:24:11.636 --> 00:24:12.756]  And I think you all know it too.
[00:24:13.156 --> 00:24:14.177]  We are screwed.
[00:24:15.074 --> 00:24:17.936]  But the good news is, humanity's waking up and we're going to turn this around.
[00:24:18.376 --> 00:24:19.937]  So, buckle up, folks!
[00:24:20.178 --> 00:24:22.899]  Buckle up and get ready now!
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:31.425]  Because the greatest crisis of all of our lives is happening now, and I'm just the watchman on the wall, the Paul Revere, telling you, the new world order's coming.
[00:24:31.825 --> 00:24:32.186]  It's here.
[00:24:33.046 --> 00:24:36.108]  You know how much the globalist control freaks hate this broadcast?
[00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:39.691]  You know how much they hate the fact we're still on air?
[00:24:40.759 --> 00:24:46.561]  You know what a thorn in their side it is that you have held us, with your gravity of support, in position?
[00:24:46.581 --> 00:24:50.842]  I want to salute you all.
[00:24:53.143 --> 00:24:58.325]  Because we are driving wooden stakes into these vampires' hearts, politically, culturally, spiritually.
[00:24:59.005 --> 00:25:00.485]  And that is a real pleasure.
[00:25:00.805 --> 00:25:02.805]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[00:25:02.805 --> 00:25:13.924]   For an American man leading the people out of the New World Order.
[00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:16.521]  All right, let's get into the whistleblower information.
[00:25:18.583 --> 00:25:20.304]  Now, all this is already confirmed.
[00:25:20.324 --> 00:25:21.165]  They tried to deny it.
[00:25:21.205 --> 00:25:24.168]  I've got government documents from the UK, the US, Canada, Australia.
[00:25:24.188 --> 00:25:25.389]  I'm going to show them all to you, okay?
[00:25:26.009 --> 00:25:27.310]  We do that unlike corporate media.
[00:25:27.631 --> 00:25:28.832]  You'll find this stuff, see it for yourself.
[00:25:30.526 --> 00:25:32.907]  But these globalists love being mad scientists.
[00:25:32.967 --> 00:25:36.908]  Ray Kurzweil was not just some billionaire that invented the optical scanner and all the rest of it.
[00:25:37.348 --> 00:25:45.570]  Ray Kurzweil has been the chief futurist for 26 years, 25 years, since Google was founded in 1998.
[00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:49.951]  And he's up there saying the future is not human.
[00:25:50.371 --> 00:25:54.173]  So you hear that from Klaus Schwab, you hear it from Bill Gates, you hear it from you all, or you hear it from all of them.
[00:25:54.613 --> 00:25:55.613]  That's where this is coming from.
[00:25:57.369 --> 00:25:59.871]  And how about terrorists are gonna release nanobots and take over?
[00:25:59.911 --> 00:26:00.731]  Well, they've done it.
[00:26:02.252 --> 00:26:06.135]  So, we got recently an overhead shot of this.
[00:26:06.715 --> 00:26:08.296]  The guy gave us his name, his documents.
[00:26:08.316 --> 00:26:10.218]  We always prove that whistleblower.
[00:26:10.238 --> 00:26:11.038]  We've redacted it all.
[00:26:11.939 --> 00:26:13.520]  A gentleman that has worked with Pfizer.
[00:26:15.421 --> 00:26:22.726]  And he got this email, this letter, on January 8th, 2021, right before they rolled out the poison shots.
[00:26:24.377 --> 00:26:25.097]  And it says, U.S.
[00:26:25.858 --> 00:26:29.060]  essential colleague and contractor, COVID.
[00:26:29.861 --> 00:26:35.784]  You're essential, you're just still driving your car, leaving your house, everybody else is locked down to get the propaganda they thought actually got the truth.
[00:26:35.804 --> 00:26:39.187]  These people didn't just believe the establishment, blew it with their face.
[00:26:39.247 --> 00:26:51.554]  And it goes on here to say, the vaccine does to be used for this program are separate and distinct from those committed by Pfizer to governments around the world.
[00:26:52.775 --> 00:27:06.334]   So it says right there, We'll do an overhead shot so it's clear for them that this is separate and distinct from what the general public is getting.
[00:27:08.295 --> 00:27:11.196]  Now, we already have that in documents to know that, but they tried to deny that.
[00:27:11.236 --> 00:27:11.917]  I'll show you in a moment.
[00:27:16.018 --> 00:27:17.199]  So there's that information.
[00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:19.840]  Let's show you some of the history of it.
[00:27:22.901 --> 00:27:27.362]  Pfizer official admits company employees receive different COVID jabs than the rest of the population.
[00:27:27.802 --> 00:27:29.222]  That's from last year.
[00:27:30.603 --> 00:27:31.143]  Kelly McBrain.
[00:27:31.823 --> 00:27:36.844]  We have our new article out on this today that I hope you go and share.
[00:27:36.864 --> 00:27:38.265]  It's now gone live.
[00:27:39.805 --> 00:27:45.166]  Exclusive Pfizer whistleblower leaks company email offering separate and distinct COVID-19 vaccines to workers.
[00:27:45.426 --> 00:27:48.867]  Let's make sure we've posted that on Real Alex Jones on X right now.
[00:27:51.164 --> 00:27:55.725]  So, Pfizer official admits company employees received different COVID jabs than the rest of the population.
[00:27:55.805 --> 00:28:00.647]  Once that came out, they had the fact-checkers at USA Today say it's false.
[00:28:02.007 --> 00:28:04.568]  But then they said, oh, they just held some back for themselves.
[00:28:04.608 --> 00:28:11.410]  But we have the documents, not just here but in Australia and other countries, that it was a separate, totally different concoction.
[00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:16.472]  But there's their spin that, oh, no, no, no, we didn't mean that.
[00:28:18.308 --> 00:28:21.050]  Because it's obvious they won't take it, but they want you to.
[00:28:22.472 --> 00:28:23.512]  So let's play this clip.
[00:28:25.854 --> 00:28:34.502]  This is a... Pfizer employees were given a special batch different from what was forced into the population.
[00:28:34.522 --> 00:28:38.045]  I don't see it on my list, but do we have that clip?
[00:28:38.065 --> 00:28:38.645]  If we don't, it's fine.
[00:28:38.685 --> 00:28:39.106]  We can get it.
[00:28:41.616 --> 00:28:42.496]  Well, let's grab it right now.
[00:28:42.676 --> 00:28:43.697]  Okay, it's a health bot.
[00:28:44.397 --> 00:28:47.599]  I've got news articles about it on the Australian.com.
[00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:48.199]  It's fact.
[00:28:48.899 --> 00:28:50.520]  So we'll table that till we get that clip.
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:55.442]  Here is the Australian government document from the Australian government website.
[00:28:57.003 --> 00:29:04.606]  Right here, where it talks about what the public got and it was a totally different shot versus what the Pfizer employees got.
[00:29:04.646 --> 00:29:06.367]  So there's that document.
[00:29:08.148 --> 00:29:08.748]  Here's another one.
[00:29:09.188 --> 00:29:17.288]   Why has Pfizer Change the formulation of its COVID-19 vaccine for children to include an ingredient that stabilizes people suffering heart attack.
[00:29:17.668 --> 00:29:19.690]  They admitted hundreds of changes secretly.
[00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.511]  That's why the inserts were blank.
[00:29:21.531 --> 00:29:22.191]  They wouldn't say what was in it.
[00:29:22.732 --> 00:29:23.732]  In a giant test.
[00:29:24.933 --> 00:29:25.614]  We have the clip.
[00:29:25.854 --> 00:29:36.061]  Here is the Australian Pfizer employees testifying about a special batch different from what was forced into the general population.
[00:29:36.081 --> 00:29:36.361]  Here it is.
[00:29:37.517 --> 00:29:45.322]  You read that your vaccine mandate was using your own batch of vaccine, especially imported for Pfizer, which was not tested by the TGA.
[00:29:45.702 --> 00:29:46.402]  Is that correct?
[00:29:48.904 --> 00:29:57.089]  Senator, so Pfizer undertook to import a batch of vaccine specifically for their employee vaccination program.
[00:29:57.529 --> 00:30:03.192]  I just showed you to Spiegel 15 years ago in Medellin for swine flu.
[00:30:04.838 --> 00:30:06.418]  Don't worry, we're giving you something special.
[00:30:06.678 --> 00:30:08.219]  A saline solution has come out.
[00:30:08.239 --> 00:30:08.999]  I'll show you that in a moment.
[00:30:10.719 --> 00:30:11.720]  So, kind of a big deal.
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:18.781]  Why would you give children an anti-coagulation, anti-blood clot injection mixed with it?
[00:30:19.462 --> 00:30:20.822]  That was another test they admit they did.
[00:30:20.902 --> 00:30:22.102]  Oh, these are really nice people.
[00:30:22.442 --> 00:30:24.083]  Again, all testing what they were doing.
[00:30:24.103 --> 00:30:28.344]  Pfizer secretly added heart attack drug to children's COVID vaccines.
[00:30:28.484 --> 00:30:28.744]  Why?
[00:30:31.044 --> 00:30:32.526]  And then I could play you the newscast.
[00:30:32.886 --> 00:30:36.029]  UK, Germany, Australia, US.
[00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:38.031]  I started seeing these in the middle of 2000.
[00:30:38.071 --> 00:30:41.915]  First time I saw it was during the contested election, actually late 2000.
[00:30:42.015 --> 00:30:43.997]  No, that was early 2000.
[00:30:45.779 --> 00:30:49.422]  In Phoenix, while I was there protesting election fraud.
[00:30:49.843 --> 00:30:52.786]  And I saw buses driving by saying heart attacks are normal in children.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.381]  Another bus trip.
[00:30:54.401 --> 00:30:55.361]  I have this video of this.
[00:30:55.882 --> 00:30:58.463]  Nanotech will sue me and your body and vaccines and save you.
[00:30:58.483 --> 00:31:01.906]  They are already subliminally like programming it before they did it.
[00:31:02.726 --> 00:31:03.087]  Here's one.
[00:31:03.487 --> 00:31:06.869]  Cardiac arrest can happen to anyone anytime at any age.
[00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.331]  It's quite normal for small children to have heart attacks now.
[00:31:10.692 --> 00:31:11.413]  It's the new normal.
[00:31:12.313 --> 00:31:12.814]  Nice people.
[00:31:13.594 --> 00:31:28.133]   Pfizer says Scientist says Pfizer intentionally deceived regulators about COVID-19 vaccination contamination of SV40 green monkey cancer virus that they admit killed over 100 million Americans with a polio rollout alone from cancer.
[00:31:28.994 --> 00:31:30.876]  Seriously viral cancer.
[00:31:31.996 --> 00:31:36.380]  It's like a wart, this cancer is viral, but it's a much more aggressive basically wart all over your body.
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:37.741]  Isn't that liberal?
[00:31:39.386 --> 00:31:45.652]  One dose of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine contains over 200 million DNA fragments that can incorporate into human DNA.
[00:31:46.033 --> 00:31:48.935]  That's what Dr. Malone said three years ago, the inventor of mRNA.
[00:31:49.256 --> 00:31:55.922]  Now it's mainstream FDA studies last week admitting, okay, it does contaminate your DNA with cancer viruses.
[00:31:57.564 --> 00:32:02.428]  COVID-19 vaccine data administrator reveals deaths related to bad batch of Pfizer shots.
[00:32:02.508 --> 00:32:03.770]  Oh, the really deadly batches.
[00:32:05.541 --> 00:32:08.982]  American scientists confirmed toxic graphene oxide and more in COVID injections.
[00:32:11.383 --> 00:32:11.923]  Here's the study.
[00:32:14.183 --> 00:32:16.024]  Immunization with SARS coronavirus.
[00:32:16.444 --> 00:32:23.766]  Vaccine leads to pulmonary emopathology on challenge with SARS virus.
[00:32:23.786 --> 00:32:28.987]  Pfizer vaccine matches the EU where placebos say scientists.
[00:32:29.327 --> 00:32:30.688]  That's why no one died in the study.
[00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:32.156]  Fake studies.
[00:32:32.716 --> 00:32:33.736]  COVID lies exposed.
[00:32:33.796 --> 00:32:36.277]  Evidence proves survivors of EU jab took placebos.
[00:32:38.437 --> 00:32:44.379]  Moderna's CEO tells the WEF last week that, oh, we've got millions dying.
[00:32:44.519 --> 00:32:45.679]  It's because of long COVID.
[00:32:45.719 --> 00:32:48.380]  But in the study show, it's the so-called vaccinated.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:54.621]  Pfizer stock hit after boy dies of cardiac arrest during gene therapy trial.
[00:32:54.841 --> 00:32:58.202]  He was the only person in the trial died two days after the shot.
[00:32:59.262 --> 00:32:59.882]  That sounds liberal.
[00:33:01.855 --> 00:33:06.358]  Koba Shield maker AstraZeneca with raw COVID-19 vaccines due to heart attacks, blood clots.
[00:33:06.778 --> 00:33:07.799]  That just broke last week.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.642]  Paul Goeser talks about the millions of injured and dead in Congress last week.
[00:33:14.043 --> 00:33:16.264]  Point is, this is all coming out.
[00:33:16.284 --> 00:33:17.885]  But don't worry, and get me the clips.
[00:33:18.405 --> 00:33:19.266]  I'm going to play them next day.
[00:33:19.666 --> 00:33:32.887]   Here is Chris Cuomo, the brother of the evil governor that fully implemented the UN policies of not giving people treatments, giving them Ventilators to kill him.
[00:33:36.308 --> 00:33:40.809]  Cuomo and his brother, the former governor, have now come out in a speaking tour all over the place.
[00:33:40.829 --> 00:33:41.750]  There's dozens of these clubs.
[00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:43.270]  I've seen, there must be more.
[00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:45.611]  Saying, oh no, we never said you have to tag it.
[00:33:45.631 --> 00:33:46.771]  We never said there was a little law.
[00:33:47.211 --> 00:33:48.171]  We never said it was a problem.
[00:33:48.471 --> 00:33:49.371]  We never said wear a mask.
[00:33:49.391 --> 00:33:50.272]  We never said lock you down.
[00:33:50.532 --> 00:33:59.054]  And they have the former head of Planned Parenthood, that communist Chinese minion, who is all over CNN, the rest of it, saying arrest people who don't take shots.
[00:34:00.623 --> 00:34:01.784]  They're not saying, oh, no, no, no.
[00:34:01.804 --> 00:34:02.605]  They're not behind it.
[00:34:02.685 --> 00:34:03.265]  They're good.
[00:34:03.285 --> 00:34:04.326]  They believe in Ivermectin.
[00:34:04.586 --> 00:34:07.809]  But Chris Cuomo says he got sick from the shot last week.
[00:34:10.992 --> 00:34:17.458]  So let's go ahead and play Chris Cuomo first and then his brother, the disgraced governor.
[00:34:17.858 --> 00:34:20.420]  Here's a Chris Cuomo suddenly loves Ivermectin.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:20.761]  Here it is.
[00:34:22.435 --> 00:34:26.038]  I am taking a regular dose of Ivermectin.
[00:34:26.058 --> 00:34:28.900]  Ivermectin was a boogeyman early on in COVID.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.400]  That was wrong.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.002]  We were given bad information about Ivermectin.
[00:34:31.822 --> 00:34:35.622]  Ivermectin was a boogeyman early on in COVID.
[00:34:35.622 --> 00:34:36.862]  You couldn't talk about it.
[00:34:36.862 --> 00:34:38.701]  That was wrong.
[00:34:38.701 --> 00:34:42.222]  We were given bad information about Ivermectin.
[00:34:42.222 --> 00:34:44.981]  The real question is why?
[00:34:44.981 --> 00:34:47.222]  Everyone's going to say Joe Rogan was right.
[00:34:47.271 --> 00:34:49.874]  No, Joe Rogan was saying, yeah, he was right.
[00:34:50.234 --> 00:34:51.956]  But that's not what matters.
[00:34:51.996 --> 00:34:55.920]  What matters is the entire clinical community knew that ivermectin couldn't hurt you.
[00:34:56.601 --> 00:34:57.562]  They knew it, Patrick.
[00:34:58.042 --> 00:34:58.983]  I know they knew it.
[00:34:59.024 --> 00:34:59.424]  How do I know?
[00:34:59.724 --> 00:35:06.191]  Because now I'm doing nothing but talking to these clinicians who at the time were overwhelmed by COVID and they weren't saying anything.
[00:35:06.371 --> 00:35:16.293]  Not that they were hiding anything, but it's cheap, it's not owned by anybody, and it's used as an antimicrobial, antiviral, in all of these different ways.
[00:35:16.313 --> 00:35:17.353]  It has been for a long time.
[00:35:17.494 --> 00:35:19.494]  For malaria, for over almost 20 years.
[00:35:19.514 --> 00:35:27.716]  Yeah, so, and my doctor, who is now my doctor, was using it during COVID on her family and on patients, and it was working for them.
[00:35:28.678 --> 00:35:32.221]  So, they were wrong to play scared on that.
[00:35:32.822 --> 00:35:33.742]  Didn't know that at the time.
[00:35:34.103 --> 00:35:34.643]  Know it now.
[00:35:34.903 --> 00:35:35.524]  Admit it now.
[00:35:35.724 --> 00:35:36.585]  Reporting on it now.
[00:35:36.905 --> 00:35:38.186]  Because I think that's the job.
[00:35:39.087 --> 00:35:40.968]  So that's his rehabilitation campaign.
[00:35:41.068 --> 00:35:42.189]  Oh, I'm sick from the shots.
[00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:42.850]  I'm wrong.
[00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:50.376]  And then his brother, Andrew Cuomo, goes on with the Planned Parenthood lady and says, oh no, we never did this.
[00:35:50.436 --> 00:35:51.077]  Everything's fine.
[00:35:51.097 --> 00:35:52.198]  We're your friends now.
[00:35:52.218 --> 00:35:54.259]  And they're just total jokes.
[00:35:54.279 --> 00:35:59.193]   So these are Scared little minions running like Nazis at the end of World War II trying to hide.
[00:35:59.213 --> 00:35:59.573]  Here it is.
[00:36:00.853 --> 00:36:20.739]  I believe if government would now say, we just made a finding that there's a new virus and everyone should do X, Y, and Z, the amount of compliance with X, Y, and Z would be much, much lower than it was at the beginning of COVID because people do not trust the government.
[00:36:21.719 --> 00:36:25.920]  Especially on this issue, the way they did at the beginning.
[00:36:26.721 --> 00:36:29.721]  And that would be a complicating factor, right?
[00:36:29.801 --> 00:36:33.082]  When you have people who just don't listen.
[00:36:33.723 --> 00:36:37.804]  Because government had no capacity to enforce any of this.
[00:36:39.004 --> 00:36:40.265]  You must wear a mask.
[00:36:42.085 --> 00:36:44.346]  And people wore masks in New York.
[00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:49.921]  But if they said, I'm not wearing a mask, there was nothing I could do about it.
[00:36:51.004 --> 00:36:53.209]  You must close your private business.
[00:36:53.971 --> 00:36:54.372]  I won't.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.782]  Well, there was nothing I could really do about it.
[00:36:57.822 --> 00:37:11.774]  It was really all voluntary, and it was extraordinary when you think about it, that society acted with that uniformity voluntarily, because I had no enforcement capacity.
[00:37:12.494 --> 00:37:16.438]  So, you have a reduced trust in government.
[00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:19.772]  All right, that's a clip I sent you guys two days ago.
[00:37:19.832 --> 00:37:20.453]  That's my fault.
[00:37:20.673 --> 00:37:23.936]  I have a new clip of her saying, go after anybody that doesn't take the shot.
[00:37:23.976 --> 00:37:24.857]  You've got to take the shot.
[00:37:25.337 --> 00:37:27.319]  That's what's really, really, really, really powerful.
[00:37:27.339 --> 00:37:28.300]  So let me just send it again here.
[00:37:29.882 --> 00:37:31.243]  We'll just take care of that.
[00:37:33.605 --> 00:37:36.808]  And we'll get it on air because that's what I'm going to do here.
[00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:40.152]  Because that's what I want to do.
[00:37:40.172 --> 00:37:42.374]  And that's what I'm going to do.
[00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:48.011]  I try as hard as I can, folks.
[00:37:47.831 --> 00:37:49.831]  I swear to God I tried.
[00:37:49.831 --> 00:37:53.831]  [Clears throat]
[00:37:53.831 --> 00:37:56.831]  It's fine in here.
[00:37:56.831 --> 00:38:02.831]  [Silence]
[00:38:02.831 --> 00:38:03.831]  [Sniffles]
[00:38:03.831 --> 00:38:05.831]  [Punch]
[00:38:05.006 --> 00:38:10.630]  Just go to X and type in Chris Cuomo or Andrew Cuomo.
[00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:12.472]  I don't get it.
[00:38:13.553 --> 00:38:14.734]  Just go to rebroadcast for a while.
[00:38:16.391 --> 00:38:20.932]  She's got a rebroadcast, and no, it's not Cuomo saying he's sick now.
[00:38:21.032 --> 00:38:23.733]  It's the clip of her as he's saying, arrest everybody.
[00:38:23.933 --> 00:38:27.814]  And then it's got clips of her saying, we didn't ever do anything.
[00:38:28.294 --> 00:38:29.254]  We never did anything wrong.
[00:38:31.035 --> 00:38:33.276]  Hell, I even put it out on X. I'll find it that way.
[00:38:34.616 --> 00:38:35.896]  One way or another, I'm getting this right now.
[00:38:37.097 --> 00:38:37.717]  I'm leaving.
[00:38:37.757 --> 00:38:38.477]  I'm happy about it.
[00:38:38.497 --> 00:38:38.837]  It's fine.
[00:38:39.437 --> 00:38:40.598]  But I've got a real Alex Jones.
[00:38:42.058 --> 00:38:42.418]  I sent it.
[00:38:42.818 --> 00:38:43.418]  And let me see.
[00:38:43.478 --> 00:38:43.798]  OK.
[00:38:43.818 --> 00:38:45.659]  I sent that yesterday.
[00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:48.190]  We'll do it.
[00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:48.691]  Got to have it.
[00:38:48.851 --> 00:38:49.391]  Okay, here it is.
[00:38:49.712 --> 00:38:50.112]  All right, great.
[00:38:50.172 --> 00:38:50.392]  Found it.
[00:38:50.772 --> 00:38:51.013]  Perfect.
[00:38:51.553 --> 00:38:52.234]  Come and sit here right now.
[00:38:53.335 --> 00:38:54.476]  And here is the clip.
[00:38:55.457 --> 00:39:00.501]  And I'm going to show people on X. It goes, it says, you can run, but you can't hide.
[00:39:00.521 --> 00:39:04.324]  It's only about 10 posts deep from eight hours ago.
[00:39:04.344 --> 00:39:11.811]  And it is a very, very, very, very, very important clip.
[00:39:13.666 --> 00:39:17.614]  You can run but you can't hide at Real Alex Jones.
[00:39:18.897 --> 00:39:20.480]  Because I'm pissed at these people, man.
[00:39:20.741 --> 00:39:23.466]  They know full well what they're doing and it's in the Spars 2025.
[00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:25.796]  Alright, we found the clip.
[00:39:25.815 --> 00:39:28.875]   report that would come out within a couple of years they did this and even
[00:39:28.875 --> 00:39:32.775]   how they would whitewash it and say we're sorry we did that to you. No you're
[00:39:32.775 --> 00:39:35.754]   not sorry. They should all be hauled before Congress, they should all be
[00:39:35.754 --> 00:39:40.555]   indicted, they got paid money to do this but instead the FBI and the Justice
[00:39:40.555 --> 00:39:43.596]   Department is completely controlled at the top with a bunch of criminals that
[00:39:43.596 --> 00:39:48.674]  don't even care about their own children.
[00:39:48.674 --> 00:39:54.355]   All right we found the clip great here it is. And I actually think this is one
[00:39:54.355 --> 00:39:59.275]   where the public health and scientific community has a lot to blame because at
[00:39:59.275 --> 00:40:03.475]   some point they began essentially people got the message that if you care about
[00:40:03.475 --> 00:40:07.994]   public health at all or your fellow citizens you have to be masking you have
[00:40:07.994 --> 00:40:12.115]   to believe in masks and vaccines and if you are not doing these things or are
[00:40:12.115 --> 00:40:16.596]   even questioning whether we should have mandates then you are somehow anti
[00:40:16.596 --> 00:40:20.315]  science or anti public health.
[00:40:18.856 --> 00:40:28.099]  There were topics that we now know are actually, they're not controversial, but they're more debatable, as in we should have a robust scientific conversation around them.
[00:40:28.199 --> 00:40:33.559]   example, natural immunity, which actually is a thing. But for a long time, it was taboo to bring
[00:40:33.559 --> 00:40:39.398]   it up for fear that you might be called an anti-vaxxer. And so I think that public trust
[00:40:39.398 --> 00:40:44.117]   has been eroded, yes, by people who are perpetuating misinformation and disinformation.
[00:40:44.117 --> 00:40:49.159]   But I think that the scientific, the people in the scientific community who did not do a very
[00:40:49.159 --> 00:40:54.599]   good job of separating fact from opinion also helped to erode that trust.
[00:40:54.599 --> 00:40:59.639]   Clear to them that the vaccine is the ticket back to pre-pandemic life.
[00:40:59.815 --> 00:41:01.736]  And the window to do that is really narrowing.
[00:41:01.836 --> 00:41:08.317]  We need to start looking at the choice to remain unvaccinated the same as we look at driving while intoxicated.
[00:41:08.337 --> 00:41:13.818]  That you have the option to not get vaccinated if you want, but then you can't go out in public.
[00:41:14.178 --> 00:41:15.379]  I don't think it goes far enough.
[00:41:15.559 --> 00:41:17.719]  I think this is what's needed in the middle of a pandemic.
[00:41:17.759 --> 00:41:21.020]  And in fact, I think the Biden administration, if anything, could have gone even further.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:30.263]  The honor code was never going to work, that when vaccinated and unvaccinated people are mixing, unless there is proof of vaccination, everybody should still be wearing masks.
[00:41:30.303 --> 00:41:42.608]  And so I actually support what the CDC is now doing, which is going back to this indoor mask requirement, because frankly, we know that we can't trust the unvaccinated, that they have been walking around without masks.
[00:41:42.748 --> 00:41:45.069]  And in fact, that's what led to the surge that we're seeing.
[00:41:45.549 --> 00:41:48.150]  How are we going to incentivize people to actually get the vaccine?
[00:41:48.431 --> 00:41:55.995]  So that's why I think the CDC and the Biden administration needs to come out a lot bolder and say, if you're vaccinated, you can do all these things.
[00:41:56.115 --> 00:41:57.896]  Here are all these freedoms that you have.
[00:41:58.296 --> 00:42:01.778]  Because otherwise, people are going to go out and enjoy these freedoms anyway.
[00:42:03.118 --> 00:42:04.759]  So 100% they've been paid off.
[00:42:04.779 --> 00:42:05.540]  We already know that.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.761]  And they've all got together in PR rooms last few months.
[00:42:09.562 --> 00:42:11.343]  Bill Gates comes out and says, I was never for masks.
[00:42:11.403 --> 00:42:11.963]  I never said that.
[00:42:12.003 --> 00:42:13.864]  I got hours of him saying, you got to wear a mask.
[00:42:15.069 --> 00:42:16.930]  You remember, you have a memory, you can pull it up.
[00:42:17.091 --> 00:42:19.492]  So, they all need to go to prison.
[00:42:19.512 --> 00:42:21.534]  They're disgusting criminals.
[00:42:23.776 --> 00:42:25.317]  Yeah, here's the actual clip I was talking about.
[00:42:26.518 --> 00:42:27.098]  Here's another one.
[00:42:27.319 --> 00:42:27.679]  Breaking.
[00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:33.403]  The government is now admitting that the increase in heart disease and excess deaths are due to COVID vaccines.
[00:42:34.384 --> 00:42:36.566]  That's in congressional reports.
[00:42:37.665 --> 00:42:38.846]  Breaking documents reveal U.S.
[00:42:38.866 --> 00:42:41.488]  State Department officials knew COVID leak from Wuhan lab.
[00:42:41.928 --> 00:42:43.969]  CCP covered it up back in July.
[00:42:44.009 --> 00:42:45.991]  It wasn't CCP, it was the Pentagon running it all.
[00:42:47.852 --> 00:42:50.454]  Meanwhile, they admit there's all these poisons in the water sterilizing you.
[00:42:50.514 --> 00:42:51.234]  ABC News.
[00:42:52.976 --> 00:42:54.437]  Remember how I got attacked for exposing that?
[00:42:55.938 --> 00:43:00.361]  Pfizer tried to hide data showing its COVID vaccine caused massive increase in miscarriages.
[00:43:00.841 --> 00:43:01.621]  Stillborn babies.
[00:43:03.303 --> 00:43:04.984]  Got a guest coming on next hour about that.
[00:43:06.254 --> 00:43:09.856]  Well, the first AstraZeneca admits its COVID vaccine can cause blood clots.
[00:43:11.357 --> 00:43:16.399]  So, that's all critical, but that's what we've been through.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.941]  And I don't take this stuff lying down.
[00:43:19.961 --> 00:43:21.282]  Not because I'm some badass.
[00:43:21.302 --> 00:43:22.162]  People are trying to kill me.
[00:43:22.402 --> 00:43:23.543]  I'm going to expose them and fight them.
[00:43:23.843 --> 00:43:24.723]  They're the bad guys.
[00:43:26.284 --> 00:43:26.944]  Oh, but I'm bad.
[00:43:27.004 --> 00:43:29.086]  I questioned Jussie Smollett in some mass shootings.
[00:43:29.126 --> 00:43:29.806]  I should shut up.
[00:43:31.547 --> 00:43:32.807]  People want me to be ashamed of what I've done.
[00:43:32.827 --> 00:43:33.648]  I'm proud of what I've done.
[00:43:36.769 --> 00:43:37.309]  And it's sick.
[00:43:37.329 --> 00:43:39.930]  A lot of the problem people attacking me are dying of cancer.
[00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.771]  They just can't even put two and two together.
[00:43:42.391 --> 00:43:42.972]  It's insane.
[00:43:43.932 --> 00:43:49.114]  So let's play a doctor at an FDA panel on the FDA board.
[00:43:49.134 --> 00:43:53.476]  They had to fire three boards to get this final board that agreed to the experimental shots.
[00:43:55.297 --> 00:43:57.638]  Says we're never going to learn about how it's safe.
[00:43:58.911 --> 00:44:00.152]  Unless you just start giving it.
[00:44:00.693 --> 00:44:01.453]  What did Bill Gates say?
[00:44:01.493 --> 00:44:03.175]  We got to mess around with it.
[00:44:03.495 --> 00:44:04.596]  We don't know what it's going to do.
[00:44:04.616 --> 00:44:06.258]  We just shoot it right in the kid's vein.
[00:44:06.298 --> 00:44:06.919]  Those are quotes.
[00:44:07.219 --> 00:44:08.000]  Want to play the clip again?
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:09.501]  I played them yesterday three times.
[00:44:09.581 --> 00:44:10.862]  I'm not going to play it again.
[00:44:10.902 --> 00:44:11.643]  They said that.
[00:44:13.905 --> 00:44:17.809]  And so here is the FDA board member at an FDA meeting.
[00:44:19.252 --> 00:44:20.213]  Giggling and laughing.
[00:44:20.293 --> 00:44:22.114]  We don't know what it does until we give it to you.
[00:44:22.394 --> 00:44:23.594]  That's called the guinea pig.
[00:44:23.795 --> 00:44:35.021]  The truth is, they already tested it at University of Texas, Galveston, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, under Obama, and they cooked this up, then they had it on the shelf to attack the world when they were ready.
[00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:36.602]  A terrorist attack of nanobots.
[00:44:37.342 --> 00:44:38.763]  You heard Ray Kurzweil brag about earlier.
[00:44:40.724 --> 00:44:42.905]  See, if you're informed, folks, this is all naked.
[00:44:43.785 --> 00:44:46.407]  But do you have the will to admit it was done to you?
[00:44:47.361 --> 00:44:47.982]  God, that's scary.
[00:44:48.002 --> 00:44:48.542]  They'll come after me.
[00:44:48.762 --> 00:44:50.404]  They're already coming after you.
[00:44:51.624 --> 00:44:53.226]  We're forcing them out in the open.
[00:44:54.347 --> 00:44:54.907]  Here's the clip.
[00:44:56.669 --> 00:45:01.132]  But we're never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is unless you start giving it.
[00:45:01.973 --> 00:45:03.214]  That's just the way it goes.
[00:45:04.495 --> 00:45:05.756]  And the full clip, he brags about it.
[00:45:06.196 --> 00:45:07.177]  Play it again, one more time.
[00:45:07.517 --> 00:45:08.398]  That's FDA board member.
[00:45:10.103 --> 00:45:14.544]  But we're never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is unless we start giving it.
[00:45:15.385 --> 00:45:16.625]  That's just the way it goes.
[00:45:17.165 --> 00:45:22.947]  So they said it was safe and effective but it was experimental and they said they didn't know what it would do because they actually knew.
[00:45:22.967 --> 00:45:24.667]  Let's play it five times in a row.
[00:45:24.687 --> 00:45:25.287]  Just five times.
[00:45:27.388 --> 00:45:31.849]  But we're never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is unless we start giving it.
[00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:33.770]  That's just the way it goes.
[00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:39.230]  But we're never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is unless we start giving it.
[00:45:40.031 --> 00:45:41.252]  That's just the way it goes.
[00:45:42.133 --> 00:45:46.598]  But we're never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is unless we start giving it.
[00:45:47.399 --> 00:45:48.621]  That's just the way it goes.
[00:45:49.502 --> 00:45:53.967]  But we're never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is unless we start giving it.
[00:45:54.767 --> 00:45:55.889]  That's just the way it goes.
[00:45:56.878 --> 00:46:01.342]  But we're never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is unless we start giving it.
[00:46:01.822 --> 00:46:03.304]  You know, that's just the way it goes.
[00:46:03.824 --> 00:46:04.725]  Can we play it five more times?
[00:46:04.745 --> 00:46:05.746]  What do you think?
[00:46:06.246 --> 00:46:08.028]  Because I could play you Bill Gates saying it, too.
[00:46:08.088 --> 00:46:09.089]  I mean, it's in the literary.
[00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:10.149]  It's a fact they did it.
[00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:13.012]  They're bragging while they're on the news saying it was all tested.
[00:46:13.052 --> 00:46:13.873]  It's totally safe.
[00:46:13.933 --> 00:46:14.573]  It's wonderful.
[00:46:15.814 --> 00:46:16.775]  We've got a guest coming up.
[00:46:16.795 --> 00:46:18.497]  I didn't even get to half the research we did.
[00:46:18.537 --> 00:46:20.158]  I've got all these other clubs have been missing it.
[00:46:24.508 --> 00:46:25.689]  They could kill me at any moment.
[00:46:25.769 --> 00:46:26.949]  They could shut us down at any moment.
[00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:28.430]  I'm not being dramatic, folks.
[00:46:29.091 --> 00:46:30.752]  You have no idea what's going on behind the scenes.
[00:46:31.492 --> 00:46:32.192]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:46:33.313 --> 00:46:33.913]  It's next level.
[00:46:34.534 --> 00:46:35.034]  It's okay.
[00:46:35.054 --> 00:46:36.435]  I expect that I'll be an over-the-target.
[00:46:36.455 --> 00:46:38.476]  But take every day as precious.
[00:46:39.116 --> 00:46:40.937]  Take every day that InfoWars is on the air as precious.
[00:46:41.518 --> 00:46:42.939]  And support us and spread the word.
[00:46:42.979 --> 00:46:43.959]  And take our video links.
[00:46:44.299 --> 00:46:48.582]  Remember RealAlexJones on X. And InfoWars.com forward slash show and may not video.
[00:46:48.642 --> 00:46:50.503]  And share them like your life depends on it.
[00:46:50.803 --> 00:46:51.884]  Because it does!
[00:46:53.615 --> 00:46:54.376]  Good God!
[00:46:55.617 --> 00:47:00.321]  I mean, this is so fantastical, and people can't admit it because it's so horrible, and I get that.
[00:47:00.341 --> 00:47:03.683]  We're going to just come back and start the next hour.
[00:47:03.704 --> 00:47:05.505]  We have a special guest coming on.
[00:47:05.565 --> 00:47:17.795]  Just play Red States Targeted with Bad Matches, and then New Zealand whistleblower Barry Young, and then I got the other clips about this, but I mean, cancer's up 20,000% on average now.
[00:47:17.875 --> 00:47:18.956]  It was 10,000% before this.
[00:47:18.976 --> 00:47:20.538]  They're murdering everybody.
[00:47:22.535 --> 00:47:28.818]  So, um, listen, I need your support.
[00:47:29.139 --> 00:47:30.639]  There's a lot of stuff behind the scenes going on.
[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:42.326]  If you want to keep us on air, either here or wherever I'm going to be going, and I'm going to try to take the crew with me, but I've been an honest broker in this and I've not got that stuff ready yet, but they are months away from shutting us down.
[00:47:42.766 --> 00:47:43.366]  I've been so busy.
[00:47:43.406 --> 00:47:46.828]  I haven't done it yet, but I said I'd probably do it this week.
[00:47:47.228 --> 00:47:48.469]  I'm going to definitely have to do it next week.
[00:47:51.638 --> 00:47:53.819]  If they shut it down, it'll take three or four months to shut it down.
[00:47:53.859 --> 00:47:54.639]  That's how the law works.
[00:47:54.699 --> 00:47:56.199]  You'll get your products or it'll be shipped to you.
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:56.940]  Infowars.com.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.521]  And I don't want to have to announce this to people, but I'm having to make those decisions because that's what's happening.
[00:48:03.362 --> 00:48:06.963]  If you want to support us, go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:48:07.343 --> 00:48:08.743]  Drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:48:09.143 --> 00:48:10.324]  Get the nano silver products.
[00:48:11.388 --> 00:48:12.608]  That's a little financial energy.
[00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:21.552]  Get the rocket rest, get the top brain, get all the products at drjonesnaturals.com if you want to continue on and if you want to prop us up in the fight.
[00:48:21.572 --> 00:48:23.912]  Because I'll never give up, but I got to be propped up, folks.
[00:48:23.952 --> 00:48:24.713]  I got to have your support.
[00:48:25.233 --> 00:48:26.513]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:48:26.553 --> 00:48:27.254]  Go there now.
[00:48:27.574 --> 00:48:27.974]  Stay with us.
[00:48:28.783 --> 00:48:30.424]  Let's go to Nurse Keith in Oregon.
[00:48:30.444 --> 00:48:30.964]  You're on the air.
[00:48:31.004 --> 00:48:31.905]  Welcome and thanks for holding.
[00:48:32.265 --> 00:48:42.590]  About an hour ago, you were kind of explaining to people about how the micronutrients and stuff that are available and different foods actually have an effect on... Let's be clear.
[00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:45.112]  There isn't long-term, billion-year evolution.
[00:48:45.352 --> 00:48:53.111]   There's jumps, but like how you build a car, cars have evolved, or electricity, or computers
[00:48:53.111 --> 00:48:54.332]  have changed.
[00:48:54.332 --> 00:48:59.632]   There is innovation and humans do get ancestral memories from their ancestors.
[00:48:59.632 --> 00:49:00.632]  That's called instincts.
[00:49:00.632 --> 00:49:01.632]  Yes.
[00:49:01.632 --> 00:49:07.231]   Not trying to brag, but I'm a board certified wound care associate, which is not an easy
[00:49:07.231 --> 00:49:08.672]  certification.
[00:49:08.499 --> 00:49:15.059]   to get takes years and it encompasses you know cardiology, endocrine, pulmonary, you name it,
[00:49:15.059 --> 00:49:20.098]   you've got to be good at all kinds of stuff and let's face it a lot of my doctors they don't know
[00:49:20.098 --> 00:49:26.338]   anything about this stuff. It's my job as a nurse to figure it out. The average medical doctor gets
[00:49:26.338 --> 00:49:31.939]   two hours of college education on nutrition. So one of the things that I do is I'm looking for
[00:49:32.819 --> 00:49:43.779]   results and by using very good nutraceuticals and supplements and things like that I can fix a
[00:49:44.427 --> 00:49:51.870]  Just a real quick example, let's say you have a really bad wound on your leg and you have diabetes and poor circulation.
[00:49:51.970 --> 00:50:03.299]   Well, I can order you a bottle of Nitric Boost, a bottle of Bezo Beats, and Get your ass up on a treadmill a little bit.
[00:50:03.781 --> 00:50:08.115]  And these things work better than any of the medication that we give.
[00:50:08.832 --> 00:50:13.975]  So I've got about 35,000 points because I gave these things away as gifts.
[00:50:14.295 --> 00:50:14.896]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:50:14.936 --> 00:50:15.736]  This is important.
[00:50:15.776 --> 00:50:17.157]  This is important, absolutely.
[00:50:17.617 --> 00:50:20.399]  Just iodine alone, it's essential.
[00:50:20.419 --> 00:50:21.220]  It means you die without it.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.781]  They don't tell you most people are deficient.
[00:50:23.121 --> 00:50:25.202]  Two billion people have cognitive disabilities, the UN admits.
[00:50:25.442 --> 00:50:28.584]  That's what these concentrated plants and other compounds do.
[00:50:28.984 --> 00:50:33.187]   So you're saying you're taking care of people with wounds, one of the biggest Medical industry's out there.
[00:50:33.247 --> 00:50:34.067]  Super tough job.
[00:50:34.408 --> 00:50:37.850]  You're seeing with nutrition and also they need to not be sedentary, obviously.
[00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:41.232]  You're seeing massive effects, because I've actually read about this.
[00:50:41.272 --> 00:50:50.357]  I'm not an expert like you, but that there's massive problems because the doctors don't even say exercise or get out of the bed or take supplements that are good for your skin.
[00:50:50.917 --> 00:50:51.758]  And it's so simple.
[00:50:51.818 --> 00:50:56.320]  I mean, my wife takes supplements to have good hair and good nails and it really works for her.
[00:50:56.421 --> 00:50:57.521]  I mean, this stuff works.
[00:50:57.601 --> 00:50:58.542]  It's the compounds.
[00:50:58.882 --> 00:51:00.303]  Tell people about some of the things you've witnessed.
[00:51:00.823 --> 00:51:07.050]  Alex, I would not have 35,000 Patriot Points if this stuff didn't work.
[00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:10.453]  I'm not into buying BS and I don't push BS.
[00:51:11.094 --> 00:51:18.289]   When I've got a complex wound and I see something that you guys sell that I know Perfectly fits.
[00:51:18.769 --> 00:51:20.490]  I love vitamin C and zinc.
[00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:27.731]  It's simple stuff, but the difference is that things that you guys sell versus what I buy at Walmart, they're not even in the same game.
[00:51:27.991 --> 00:51:29.831]  The stuff that you guys sell is legit.
[00:51:30.131 --> 00:51:34.812]  We can sell the stuff Walmart sells, synthetic stuff, and the bottle costs more than what they're selling.
[00:51:35.252 --> 00:51:40.893]  With us, these products, some of these products are costing us $30 a bottle, like DNA Force, okay?
[00:51:41.153 --> 00:51:44.294]  I mean, so there's cost because it is the highest rated.
[00:51:44.614 --> 00:51:52.118]  If you're taking a nitrate, like you were talking about the nitrate boost, well, that is going to vasodilate.
[00:51:52.798 --> 00:51:57.220]  So when you're vasodilated, yeah, you're going to be pitching a proper 10.
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.221]  The vasobeat does the exact same thing.
[00:51:59.621 --> 00:52:02.843]  But it also helps if I've got a person who's got really poor perfusion.
[00:52:03.721 --> 00:52:09.887]  And I just want to get their blood flow going so that I can keep this wound from going septic and actually get some granulation going.
[00:52:10.427 --> 00:52:12.409]  Or I could throw all the medications at it.
[00:52:12.689 --> 00:52:13.810]  Not going to do a damn thing.
[00:52:14.171 --> 00:52:19.455]  The doctors see the patient for 10 minutes, write a prescription, say, okay, come back in 45 days.
[00:52:19.796 --> 00:52:21.677]  And it's my job to actually go figure it out.
[00:52:21.857 --> 00:52:24.400]  And so I use a lot of the stuff that you guys have.
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:26.582]  Thank you so much and God bless you, Nurse Keith.
[00:52:26.602 --> 00:52:27.182]  We'll talk to you soon.
[00:52:27.202 --> 00:52:27.763]  Give us your name and number.
[00:52:30.982 --> 00:52:36.707]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
