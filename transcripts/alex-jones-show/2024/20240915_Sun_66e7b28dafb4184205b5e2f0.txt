[00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:35.262]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:45.066]  We are 50 days, 9 hours, 59 minutes, 34 seconds.
[00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:59.314]  Until the election, the most important election in world history, it is Sunday, September 15, 2024.
[00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:10.161]  And on Friday's show, I said another assassination attempt against Trump is imminent, probably at Mar-a-Lago, probably at his golf course.
[00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:11.262]  That's the main target.
[00:01:11.322 --> 00:01:12.823]  They know when he's there most often.
[00:01:15.085 --> 00:01:18.407]  And we caught the globalists with their pants down on this big time.
[00:01:18.647 --> 00:01:20.569]  I have literally hundreds of articles.
[00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:24.807]  We're within minutes of this breaking, about an hour and 45 minutes ago.
[00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:35.835]  Every channel, CNN, New York Times, all of them have been given the official story by whoever, that it was just a gang shootout and it wasn't Trump and everything was fine.
[00:01:37.016 --> 00:01:39.978]  Then Sean Hannity was supposed to go with and play golf this morning, but didn't.
[00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.300]  Calls Trump and calls other witnesses.
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.881]  They're between the fifth and sixth hole.
[00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:47.603]  The Secret Service see a guy with a gun, pointed at Trump.
[00:01:47.884 --> 00:01:49.145]  They reportedly start shooting.
[00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:50.846]  They tackle Trump.
[00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:55.312]  He had a semi-automatic rifle described as an AK-47 type.
[00:01:57.872 --> 00:01:58.812]  They returned fire.
[00:01:59.093 --> 00:02:05.054]  The individual flees in a black SUV and has been captured.
[00:02:06.794 --> 00:02:08.274]  Now, will they blame Iran?
[00:02:09.315 --> 00:02:09.815]  We don't know.
[00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:19.637]  But who gave them the story that, oh, it's a high-crime area, the richest area in the U.S., and that it wasn't an assassination attempt of Trump?
[00:02:20.643 --> 00:02:27.244]  We saw and heard the same thing in Butler for eight hours, that it was an assassination attempt and Trump had just fallen down.
[00:02:27.264 --> 00:02:37.106]  And then Google for a month and a half, it was two month mark on Friday of the assassination attempt, wouldn't show any searches of Trump assassination images, articles, videos.
[00:02:38.146 --> 00:02:39.126]  They just made that decision.
[00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:44.087]  So we're seeing the same attempt at information management, but it's failed.
[00:02:45.267 --> 00:02:49.168]  It's all at Relox Jones on X, Sean Hannity, Mario Dufault,
[00:02:51.445 --> 00:02:52.126]  Jack Posobiec.
[00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:57.149]  And we're going to get all those folks on the broadcast, but I'm tracking all this in live time as well.
[00:02:59.611 --> 00:03:01.312]  And obviously we've been predicting all of it.
[00:03:02.313 --> 00:03:03.754]  I shot a report minutes before we went live.
[00:03:03.814 --> 00:03:05.115]  It's now on X that you can share.
[00:03:05.175 --> 00:03:10.599]  Donald Trump survives second assassination attempt as corporate media goes into full damage control mode.
[00:03:12.361 --> 00:03:13.742]  That's on real Alex Jones on X.
[00:03:18.388 --> 00:03:20.189]  So here's the headline.
[00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:21.190]  I have the video clips.
[00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:26.454]  CNN reports Trump was target of shots fired.
[00:03:31.658 --> 00:03:34.640]  CNN reports Trump was target of shots fired.
[00:03:38.983 --> 00:03:42.306]  Suspect detained after fleeing an SUV from Trump golf course shooting.
[00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:48.262]  Suspect pointed rifle at Trump.
[00:03:48.602 --> 00:03:52.505]  May have shot golf course before Secret Service opened fire.
[00:03:53.826 --> 00:03:57.208]  Suspect in Trump golf course incident arrested on I-95.
[00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.850]  MSM had their story lined up.
[00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.771]  Trump safer for gunshots fired in his vicinity.
[00:04:03.432 --> 00:04:07.055]  Remember, an AK-47 semi-automatic rifle was recovered as well as GoPro camera.
[00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:12.818]  Just in, Secret Service did fire back at possible assassin.
[00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.401]  Don't worry, AG Garland briefed on Trump security incident.
[00:04:18.137 --> 00:04:25.923]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can't go to the DHS or the Justice Department.
[00:04:25.943 --> 00:04:29.966]  They're the ones that had to stand down and lied to Congress and did what they did in Butler.
[00:04:30.607 --> 00:04:35.690]  And when they failed and Trump got even more popular, what were they going to try again?
[00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:41.355]  Well, you know what they're going to try again.
[00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:46.592]  They're going to try to kill him again, and again, and again.
[00:04:46.612 --> 00:04:51.193]  And Trump needs to start taking this stuff seriously.
[00:04:52.933 --> 00:04:57.874]  He needs to just go to a media bunker, point out that he's trying to kill him, and broadcast basically 10 hours a day.
[00:04:58.475 --> 00:04:59.275]  He'll win by 75 points.
[00:04:59.435 --> 00:05:02.836]  If he keeps running around, they will kill him.
[00:05:02.856 --> 00:05:06.877]  If he makes it to the election, they'll kill him when he's president-elect during the 76 days.
[00:05:07.597 --> 00:05:10.317]  It's absolute certainty they're going to keep trying until they kill him.
[00:05:10.737 --> 00:05:11.338]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:11.518 --> 00:05:12.158]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:12.198 --> 00:05:12.598]  We're live.
[00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:19.312]  Well, there's a reason during this election I've been broadcasting seven days a week.
[00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:21.313]  We were up here yesterday filing a bunch of reports.
[00:05:21.773 --> 00:05:28.695]  We're here live right now at 4.06 Central Time, 5.06 Eastern, 3.06 Mountain, 2.06 Pacific.
[00:05:30.076 --> 00:05:34.657]  And it's because massive developments are happening every day.
[00:05:35.698 --> 00:05:38.179]  The globalist Deep State tried to kill Trump and Butler.
[00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:39.259]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:05:40.213 --> 00:05:41.334]  They lied to Congress about it.
[00:05:41.414 --> 00:05:42.735]  All the evidence came out last week.
[00:05:43.155 --> 00:05:45.297]  They want to start pure World War III with Russia.
[00:05:46.017 --> 00:05:52.942]  Biden did greenlight bombing Russia starting as early as this week with heavy U.S.-made missiles, an act of war, Russia says.
[00:05:53.542 --> 00:05:59.426]  They need Trump out of the way for their big global plans of global domination.
[00:05:59.947 --> 00:06:01.308]  So there's so much to unpack here.
[00:06:01.348 --> 00:06:08.413]  Now, about two hours ago, on the golf course by Mar-a-Lago, between the fifth and sixth hole,
[00:06:09.605 --> 00:06:10.606]  Citizens saw it.
[00:06:10.686 --> 00:06:11.587]  Witnesses saw it.
[00:06:12.188 --> 00:06:12.929]  It's now come out.
[00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:18.515]  A man very calmly got on an SUV with a GoPro and a rifle and go up to the woods and wait.
[00:06:18.835 --> 00:06:19.856]  Be right where Trump would be.
[00:06:20.136 --> 00:06:22.519]  Totally being coordinated, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:28.885]  And either began to shot or was about to shoot and the Secret Service tackled Trump, shot at him.
[00:06:29.106 --> 00:06:29.666]  He escaped.
[00:06:29.686 --> 00:06:30.467]  They've captured him.
[00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.614]  Did the globalist hire through some third party an Iranian who thinks she's for the Iranians and they're about to set up Iran in World War III?
[00:06:37.634 --> 00:06:39.416]  I've seen a lot of pre-programming on that.
[00:06:39.556 --> 00:06:39.977]  I don't know.
[00:06:41.618 --> 00:06:43.360]  Is it some maniac that had help?
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.881]  Because he clearly knew we're right to be.
[00:06:47.363 --> 00:06:48.925]  And again, just like Butler, it was citizens.
[00:06:48.945 --> 00:06:51.207]  Hey, there's a guy on the roof with a gun, a gun, and nothing's done.
[00:06:51.227 --> 00:06:56.151]  90 minutes, he's caught with rangefinders, a bag, a bike.
[00:06:57.267 --> 00:06:59.448]  He's jumping from building to building, didn't climb up the building.
[00:06:59.588 --> 00:07:01.429]  The Secret Service said don't put people on the building.
[00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:03.749]  The Secret Service didn't shoot the shooter, Crooks.
[00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.110]  It was the cops.
[00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:13.453]  Everything we were told was a lie by the same DHS that wants Trump dead, by the same Justice Department that's waging war against Trump.
[00:07:13.873 --> 00:07:23.177]  They failed at every level with the impeachments and the scams and the indictments and the fake conviction and the civil lawfare.
[00:07:24.297 --> 00:07:25.718]  The next thing on the trajectory is to kill him.
[00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:29.411]  And I'm going to say it again, what is Trump doing out playing golf?
[00:07:30.612 --> 00:07:34.076]  Well, then you go to the rallies and have an iron glass around him or bulletproof glass.
[00:07:34.896 --> 00:07:41.022]  But I've said this about a thousand times in the last two months, at least, I mean, probably 10 times a day.
[00:07:41.042 --> 00:07:44.125]  So do the math that Trump is rolling the dice on this.
[00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:48.542]  So for me, that's the big front and center issue here.
[00:07:48.642 --> 00:07:50.243]  This is a Sunday emergency broadcast.
[00:07:50.283 --> 00:07:54.305]  Secret Service confirms second assassination attempt on President Trump in Florida.
[00:07:54.925 --> 00:07:59.707]  Alex Jones, that's me, is live on air right now breaking down Deep State's next move and how to stop them.
[00:08:01.227 --> 00:08:06.830]  And I said all last week, I said imminently they're going to try to kill him again.
[00:08:08.735 --> 00:08:12.376]  And then two hours ago, right when this broke, oh, it's just gang-related.
[00:08:12.396 --> 00:08:13.676]  It's a high crime area, which isn't true.
[00:08:13.956 --> 00:08:14.837]  We're just part of the U.S.
[00:08:15.957 --> 00:08:18.798]  High crime area with all the cops and Secret Service, all the place running around.
[00:08:20.118 --> 00:08:21.319]  And it's no big deal.
[00:08:21.359 --> 00:08:21.879]  Everything's fine.
[00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:24.319]  Just like they said for eight hours, Trump wasn't shot at.
[00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:25.240]  He just fell down.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.540]  You saw Google cover it up.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.861]  So when you see them ready with their official story all at the same time, it's very suspicious.
[00:08:33.762 --> 00:08:36.663]  But seeing into their credit, about an hour and 30 minutes later,
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.548]  Just about 25-30 minutes ago, came out and said, okay, we've talked to the Secret Service.
[00:08:41.568 --> 00:08:42.891]  They say the guy was trying to shoot Trump.
[00:08:43.873 --> 00:08:48.903]  The same story Hannity put out an hour and a half ago, because he is good friends with Trump.
[00:08:50.342 --> 00:08:50.822]  We're good to go.
[00:09:12.372 --> 00:09:13.273]  A lot's coming out.
[00:09:13.873 --> 00:09:14.934]  We'll cover it.
[00:09:15.134 --> 00:09:17.016]  We've got four hours here with the crew tonight.
[00:09:17.477 --> 00:09:19.478]  Sunday Night Live's coming up at Chase Geyser, 6 p.m.
[00:09:19.498 --> 00:09:21.160]  Central, in an hour and 50 minutes.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.581]  I will stay on with him.
[00:09:23.342 --> 00:09:26.965]  And as more unfolds, we will have every bit of it here for you.
[00:09:27.886 --> 00:09:29.767]  But they have the suspect in custody.
[00:09:30.208 --> 00:09:38.355]  And if you think you're going to get the truth out of Mayorkas-controlled Secret Service or the rest of the FBI controlled by Merrick Garland, I got a bridge
[00:09:39.898 --> 00:09:44.281]  In Brooklyn, I want to sell you some oceanfront property in Arizona from my front porch.
[00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:45.042]  You can see the sea.
[00:09:45.602 --> 00:09:47.323]  But again, listen to me carefully.
[00:09:48.704 --> 00:09:52.406]  America is in a state of war with the deep state against the people.
[00:09:53.247 --> 00:09:54.988]  Top Democrats have said they're not going to accept Trump.
[00:09:55.008 --> 00:09:58.310]  They're going to have a civil war if he's elected in 50 days.
[00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:00.172]  So I'm going to say it again.
[00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:05.150]  Trump's got ice water in his veins, but you don't know war.
[00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:13.172]  Put your top scientist or your top general out on the front line wearing his general's uniform, where every enemy can see him and take a pot shot at him.
[00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:14.012]  That's not heroic.
[00:10:14.312 --> 00:10:15.173]  That's stupid.
[00:10:16.093 --> 00:10:18.614]  And Trump should really triple his security now.
[00:10:18.994 --> 00:10:19.834]  Oh, I heard the talk.
[00:10:19.974 --> 00:10:22.475]  Oh, they won't try shooting again after they already did.
[00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:23.595]  Yeah, the hell they won't.
[00:10:24.355 --> 00:10:28.476]  Truck bombs, poisoning, missiles shooting down his plane, blaming Iran.
[00:10:28.616 --> 00:10:30.917]  I predicted that before they started pre-programming it.
[00:10:32.403 --> 00:10:33.683]  Days after they tried to kill Trump.
[00:10:33.743 --> 00:10:36.644]  I said it the day after and three days after they came out.
[00:10:36.664 --> 00:10:38.005]  Oh, the Iranians were probably behind it.
[00:10:38.225 --> 00:10:39.906]  Did the Iranians have the Secret Service stand down?
[00:10:40.246 --> 00:10:45.548]  Or have Ronald Rove, the real head of the Secret Service that ran all the stand downs, lied to Congress to do all that?
[00:10:46.268 --> 00:10:46.428]  No.
[00:10:47.888 --> 00:10:49.509]  They're making their move, folks.
[00:10:49.549 --> 00:10:50.889]  There's a coup over America.
[00:10:50.929 --> 00:10:52.230]  They stole the 2020 election.
[00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.790]  They know Trump's winning by a landslide.
[00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.111]  There's not enough fraud to steal it.
[00:10:55.651 --> 00:10:56.511]  Too big to rig.
[00:10:57.852 --> 00:10:58.212]  And so,
[00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:04.154]  All they can do is try to kill Trump.
[00:11:05.895 --> 00:11:06.876]  And they're going to kill J.D.
[00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:07.377]  Vance, too.
[00:11:07.397 --> 00:11:09.058]  They've already been sabotaging their aircraft.
[00:11:09.078 --> 00:11:10.219]  Both their aircraft have had problems.
[00:11:10.259 --> 00:11:11.520]  All of a sudden, emergency landings.
[00:11:13.161 --> 00:11:14.422]  This is just out of control.
[00:11:14.462 --> 00:11:15.764]  Drone attacks, you name it.
[00:11:15.804 --> 00:11:16.824]  Pray for Trump right now.
[00:11:21.277 --> 00:11:21.657]  You know what?
[00:11:21.857 --> 00:11:27.440]  If he keeps doing this stuff, I'm gonna go on the trail following Trump around, bullhorning and making a big scene about this.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.021]  I'm gonna protest him if he continues to do this.
[00:11:31.061 --> 00:11:32.922]  Not that I don't support him, it's the opposite.
[00:11:33.662 --> 00:11:35.023]  Trump, you're in a war.
[00:11:35.623 --> 00:11:37.804]  It's time to put you in the bunker.
[00:11:39.425 --> 00:11:41.726]  And time to come out and say, overwhelming evidence,
[00:11:42.708 --> 00:11:46.111]  Put a poll on X, 98% are going to say that Deep State's trying to kill Trump.
[00:11:46.371 --> 00:11:47.712]  You'd be an idiot at this point.
[00:11:47.892 --> 00:11:50.133]  They're starting to not know that, to not say that.
[00:11:50.334 --> 00:11:52.295]  They're about to start nuclear war with Russia.
[00:11:52.515 --> 00:11:56.778]  They just authorized Friday US heavy missiles to start raining down inside Russia.
[00:11:56.818 --> 00:11:57.939]  Russia says it's an act of war.
[00:11:58.199 --> 00:11:59.180]  We'll go to war with us.
[00:11:59.901 --> 00:12:01.302]  And Bolton goes, oh, it's just a bluff.
[00:12:02.162 --> 00:12:04.884]  Like he bluffed going into Ukraine if NATO continued to expand there?
[00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:05.365]  He did it.
[00:12:07.475 --> 00:12:10.276]  So, this is just out of control.
[00:12:10.476 --> 00:12:14.357]  This is end-of-the-world type crap going on.
[00:12:14.377 --> 00:12:16.577]  But CNN now reports about all the video clips.
[00:12:16.597 --> 00:12:19.918]  The Secret Service says it was an attempted assassination.
[00:12:20.819 --> 00:12:27.640]  And the leftists and the Democrats and their influencers are all over X. I saw them going through the news.
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:28.581]  No, it's nothing.
[00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:29.581]  It's just a backfire.
[00:12:29.641 --> 00:12:30.541]  Oh, just gang-related.
[00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:33.642]  Putting out the official story that's still been discredited.
[00:12:36.067 --> 00:12:44.289]  It's just like they tell you there's no Haitians eating geese or cats, and there's just tons of videos of them eating them and doing recipes on it, and the media is still telling you it doesn't exist.
[00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:53.950]  Oh, there's no Venezuelan gangs, or no MS-13, or no inflation, or no open border, and she was the Border Czar, and she wasn't the Border Czar, and now she is the best Border Czar ever.
[00:12:55.131 --> 00:12:57.871]  I mean, she said Tuesday, with Trump, that it's crazy.
[00:12:57.911 --> 00:12:58.891]  She doesn't want to take any guns.
[00:12:58.931 --> 00:12:59.131]  Why?
[00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:00.632]  Tim Walz loves guns.
[00:13:00.652 --> 00:13:01.212]  He loves to hunt.
[00:13:01.252 --> 00:13:01.752]  That's the quote.
[00:13:02.665 --> 00:13:14.776]  Yesterday she puts out an official policy link saying ban all semi-autos, ban all assault rifles on her axe, with a link to the new policy paper saying ban all semi-autos on the frickin' her campaign website.
[00:13:15.417 --> 00:13:23.044]  So four days before, he's crazy, it doesn't exist, and then four days later she says now she wants it again, even though we have 20 plus videos of her saying it in the last few years.
[00:13:23.285 --> 00:13:24.726]  Just like she wants to ban fracking.
[00:13:24.906 --> 00:13:26.167]  Hell yeah, ban all fracking.
[00:13:26.427 --> 00:13:27.709]  Now I never said that, you're crazy.
[00:13:29.619 --> 00:13:33.381]  So they just gaslight and gaslight and gaslight so you don't take action.
[00:13:33.441 --> 00:13:33.942]  You know it.
[00:13:33.982 --> 00:13:35.443]  They're trying to kill Trump.
[00:13:35.463 --> 00:13:36.684]  They're going to try again.
[00:13:36.704 --> 00:13:47.931]  And Trump's just out there on the golf course, where major roads drive by, where people can just get in those giant shrubs they've got there dividing the neighborhood.
[00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:53.094]  And the guy just parks his car, gets out with a gun, knows right where Trump's going to be, magically through the giant shrubs.
[00:13:53.114 --> 00:13:53.935]  You can't even see through them.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.823]  I looked it up, like 30 foot tall giant shrubs.
[00:13:57.843 --> 00:14:00.686]  He just, oh, just magically knows right where to pop out where Trump is.
[00:14:02.447 --> 00:14:06.151]  Just magically on 18 holes knew right where Trump would be, right there at the right moment.
[00:14:06.171 --> 00:14:09.114]  The Secret Service and the police are all sitting there, you know, just standing around.
[00:14:09.134 --> 00:14:12.017]  But a citizen ran up and pointed it out and saw it again and made a big noise.
[00:14:12.217 --> 00:14:13.578]  Hey, there's a guy with a gun right here!
[00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:16.301]  Secret Service, who are good, the local ones, the ones with Trump.
[00:14:16.882 --> 00:14:17.843]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.191]  Which they should have done!
[00:14:22.092 --> 00:14:24.054]  So, it's on, folks.
[00:14:24.235 --> 00:14:25.236]  It is on.
[00:14:25.356 --> 00:14:28.480]  And let me tell you, I got a vested interest in Trump surviving and becoming president.
[00:14:29.497 --> 00:14:31.898]  They've been coming after me and doing all sorts of dirty tricks.
[00:14:31.938 --> 00:14:33.098]  I'm not going to spend our time on it.
[00:14:33.398 --> 00:14:34.379]  You know the stuff going on.
[00:14:34.559 --> 00:14:36.559]  It's happening to anybody prominent defending Trump.
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:46.243]  They're coming after everybody, including you, and your energy, and your children, and your health, and your social security, and your bodily autonomy with forced injections in a UN treaty.
[00:14:46.503 --> 00:14:50.424]  I mean, we're going into slavery hardcore.
[00:14:50.464 --> 00:14:51.605]  You think stuff's crazy now?
[00:14:51.885 --> 00:14:53.285]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:14:54.386 --> 00:14:54.706]  Nothing.
[00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.111]  Absolutely nothing.
[00:14:57.791 --> 00:14:59.292]  We are in a state of war.
[00:14:59.693 --> 00:15:01.054]  The globalists have hijacked the country.
[00:15:01.074 --> 00:15:01.934]  They stole the election.
[00:15:02.154 --> 00:15:07.138]  They're at war with us, our nation, our currency, our border, our culture, our children, our bodies, our lives.
[00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:11.241]  And everybody has this normalcy bias.
[00:15:11.381 --> 00:15:15.063]  I just want to go to the movies and a nice dinner and I want to go bowling.
[00:15:15.183 --> 00:15:16.564]  Fine, great, I love all that too.
[00:15:16.884 --> 00:15:21.568]  But you don't do that when your country is being destroyed and starting World War III by psychotics.
[00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:27.470]  There's no way to describe how serious this is, and I keep saying there needs to be urgency.
[00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:28.710]  There needs to be a concern.
[00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:29.891]  You need to listen to me.
[00:15:29.911 --> 00:15:31.151]  I don't know if the listeners get that.
[00:15:34.672 --> 00:15:35.653]  The left's like, big deal.
[00:15:35.673 --> 00:15:37.453]  Poop won't do anything when we start bombing him next week.
[00:15:37.813 --> 00:15:38.013]  What?
[00:15:39.554 --> 00:15:42.395]  I mean, it's just all completely bonkers.
[00:15:44.275 --> 00:15:45.716]  Now, they just started the press conference.
[00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:46.056]  Here it is.
[00:15:46.076 --> 00:15:46.896]  We'll go to some of this.
[00:15:46.916 --> 00:15:49.617]  Notice you didn't have a press conference in Butler.
[00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:52.389]  Because it was all planned out.
[00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:54.110]  Even more than this.
[00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:59.754]  But he was given protection and they had their official story ready within 60 seconds of it breaking.
[00:16:00.415 --> 00:16:01.256]  The same story everywhere.
[00:16:01.676 --> 00:16:02.397]  How would they know that?
[00:16:02.477 --> 00:16:03.497]  Gang-related, not Trump.
[00:16:03.978 --> 00:16:04.738]  A gang shootout.
[00:16:05.219 --> 00:16:06.259]  Horrible crime area.
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.480]  Total horse crap.
[00:16:08.541 --> 00:16:09.782]  Politico, CNN, all of them.
[00:16:10.042 --> 00:16:12.484]  But soon the Secret Service said, nope, that was a guy trying to shoot him.
[00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:15.387]  Let's go to the press conference.
[00:16:15.407 --> 00:16:15.707]  Here it is.
[00:16:18.206 --> 00:16:26.733]  We are going to give you, when I say we, we have a representative from the FBI, from the Secret Service, from the State Attorney's Office, we are going to give you everything we have.
[00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:27.733]  Everything.
[00:16:27.753 --> 00:16:28.854]  Alright?
[00:16:28.994 --> 00:16:32.537]  So when we get done, think about your questions, because we're not going to take a lot.
[00:16:33.318 --> 00:16:35.339]  And keep them to the information that you heard.
[00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:39.843]  Don't get into what-ifs, and because of this, we're not going to go there.
[00:16:39.863 --> 00:16:40.303]  Alright?
[00:16:41.004 --> 00:16:43.626]  So keep that in mind, and we'll be good.
[00:16:44.446 --> 00:16:44.947]  So here we go.
[00:16:46.178 --> 00:16:48.119]  Alright, 1.30 this afternoon.
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.721]  Call came out, shots fired.
[00:16:50.741 --> 00:16:52.322]  That was called in by the Secret Service.
[00:16:52.842 --> 00:16:56.184]  Because we're in constant contact with them all the time.
[00:16:57.065 --> 00:17:02.388]  We were notified of that and we had units here that immediately sealed off the area.
[00:17:03.462 --> 00:17:17.748]  Fortunately, we were able to locate a witness that came to us and said, hey, I saw the guy running out of the bushes, he jumped into a black Nissan, and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tank, which was great.
[00:17:18.969 --> 00:17:27.273]  So, we had that information, our real-time crime center put it out to the license plate readers.
[00:17:28.499 --> 00:17:34.203]  And we were able to get a hit on that vehicle on I-95 as it was headed into Martin County.
[00:17:35.064 --> 00:17:43.210]  We got a hold of Martin County Sheriff's Office, alerted them, and they spotted the vehicle and pulled it over and detained the guy.
[00:17:44.191 --> 00:17:56.320]  After that, we took the victim, I'm sorry, the witness that witnessed the incident, took flew him up there and he identified as the person that he saw running out of the bushes and jumped into the car.
[00:17:57.216 --> 00:18:12.251]  Now, in the bushes where this guy was is an 8K47 style rifle with a scope, two backpacks which were hung on the fence that had a ceramic tile in them, and a GoPro, which he was going to take pictures of.
[00:18:13.584 --> 00:18:15.586]  So those are being processed right now.
[00:18:16.327 --> 00:18:20.711]  The Secret Service agent that was on the course did a fantastic job.
[00:18:21.291 --> 00:18:27.177]  What they do is they have an agent that jumps one hole ahead of time to where the President was at.
[00:18:28.263 --> 00:18:36.188]  And he was able to spot this rifle barrel sticking out of the fence and immediately engage that individual, at which time the individual took off.
[00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:39.050]  So that's what we know about the investigation.
[00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:43.173]  We have somebody in custody right now that is a potential suspect.
[00:18:43.213 --> 00:18:44.994]  We got a little bit more work to do on it.
[00:18:45.495 --> 00:18:56.903]  But as we usually do, as soon as we decide that we're going to book him into the county jail and the charges that he's going to be booked into, we'll get those to you and we'll get a picture of him and we'll get you his background.
[00:18:57.603 --> 00:19:03.408]  So now I'm going to turn it over to the representative of the Secret Service and he's going to make a brief statement.
[00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:07.051]  Good afternoon everyone.
[00:19:07.351 --> 00:19:17.039]  I first want to thank all of our law enforcement partners to include the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office and the Martin County Sheriff's Office for their involvement today.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.423]  Former President Donald Trump is safe and unharmed.
[00:19:22.476 --> 00:19:25.498]  Following a protective incident shortly before 2 p.m.
[00:19:25.538 --> 00:19:29.540]  on Sunday at Trump International Golf Club at West Palm Beach.
[00:19:30.701 --> 00:19:38.326]  The US Secret Service personnel opened fire on a gunman located near the property line and this matter is under investigation.
[00:19:38.966 --> 00:19:41.968]  I'll turn it over to my partners over at the FBI.
[00:19:47.597 --> 00:19:48.638]  Good afternoon, everyone.
[00:19:48.678 --> 00:19:49.838]  My name is Jeffrey Veltri.
[00:19:49.858 --> 00:19:52.900]  I'm the special agent in charge of the FBI's Miami Field Office.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:20:06.567]  The FBI has assumed the role as the lead federal law enforcement agency in the investigation of the incident that occurred earlier today at Trump International Golf Course here in West Palm Beach, Florida.
[00:20:08.448 --> 00:20:16.892]  We've deployed a number of resources, including the investigative teams, crisis response team members, bomb technicians,
[00:20:18.157 --> 00:20:20.499]  And evidence response team members as well.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.902]  What we need right now is for the public to avoid the area around the golf course.
[00:20:27.063 --> 00:20:31.566]  We will continue to support this investigation with the full resources of the FBI.
[00:20:32.687 --> 00:20:41.373]  Alongside our partners with the United States Secret Service and the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office, as well as Martin County Sheriff's Office and state and local law enforcement.
[00:20:42.543 --> 00:20:55.549]  I would ask that if anyone has any information that may assist with this investigation to contact our tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI or at tips.fbi.gov.
[00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:56.190]  Thank you.
[00:21:07.518 --> 00:21:10.459]  Hi, I'm Dave Ehrenberg, State Attorney for Palm Beach County.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.021]  I want to thank Sheriff Bradshaw and our partners at the local, state, and federal levels.
[00:21:16.242 --> 00:21:23.765]  I'm here because our prosecutors are currently working up warrants and a motion for pretrial detention for the suspect.
[00:21:25.126 --> 00:21:27.307]  In that way, he will be kept in custody.
[00:21:27.727 --> 00:21:30.989]  But our filing of these warrants and charges at the state level
[00:21:31.889 --> 00:21:34.471]  Does not preclude federal charges that could be coming.
[00:21:34.871 --> 00:21:41.315]  But in the meantime, it looks like the warrants and the pretrial detention motion will happen first.
[00:21:42.075 --> 00:21:47.239]  And again, I want to thank the cooperation we've had with our federal partners and at the local level.
[00:21:47.719 --> 00:21:49.300]  And thank you all for being here today.
[00:21:50.746 --> 00:21:53.250]  Okay, we're going to make these pictures available to you.
[00:21:53.530 --> 00:22:01.781]  It'll show you a picture of the backpack and the rifle, and there's also a GoPro on the fence there where he was intent on filming what was going on.
[00:22:02.642 --> 00:22:06.667]  Even though we're going to have to secure a couple areas around the golf course here,
[00:22:07.461 --> 00:22:08.822]  The public doesn't need to panic.
[00:22:08.882 --> 00:22:12.925]  We know that we got a post office, a library, and a school down the street.
[00:22:13.366 --> 00:22:16.729]  So we'll make it convenient for you to get to all the places you need to go.
[00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:18.170]  Get your kids to school.
[00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:19.150]  Alright, let's stop right here.
[00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.432]  They're not going to have any more information.
[00:22:22.193 --> 00:22:23.774]  Okay, we'll track it as it unfolds.
[00:22:24.295 --> 00:22:24.875]  Here's the deal.
[00:22:26.616 --> 00:22:32.041]  Put the satellite photo of Mar-a-Lago back on screen, please.
[00:22:33.885 --> 00:22:36.747]  So Trump built a $45 million golf course right next to Mar-a-Lago.
[00:22:37.368 --> 00:22:38.009]  It's in Palm Beach.
[00:22:38.429 --> 00:22:38.949]  People are confused.
[00:22:38.969 --> 00:22:40.010]  They go, is it Mar-a-Lago or Palm Beach?
[00:22:40.491 --> 00:22:43.593]  Mar-a-Lago is his resort in Palm Beach.
[00:22:44.114 --> 00:22:45.475]  It's the most expensive real estate in the world.
[00:22:46.115 --> 00:22:51.560]  He was convicted for saying it was worth $200 million when the judge who didn't have a real estate license said it was worth $18 million.
[00:22:52.201 --> 00:22:58.666]  Two acres last year sold next to it for $200 million plus.
[00:22:58.686 --> 00:23:00.468]  So it's probably worth a billion.
[00:23:00.728 --> 00:23:01.208]  The point is,
[00:23:02.432 --> 00:23:02.972]  That doesn't matter.
[00:23:02.992 --> 00:23:03.753]  Put it back on screen, please.
[00:23:03.973 --> 00:23:08.054]  If you look at it, there's a giant hedge that goes all the way around it, about 30 feet tall.
[00:23:09.215 --> 00:23:13.756]  And there's roads, as you can see, around two-thirds of it.
[00:23:17.138 --> 00:23:29.803]  So, how did this individual, they now reportedly have his photo, it's reported, it's alleged, but it's being reported of him being stopped, and it's a white man in his 60s,
[00:23:31.937 --> 00:23:33.898]  But in the fog of this, we're not sure yet.
[00:23:34.338 --> 00:23:35.239]  Other people are saying it's him.
[00:23:35.259 --> 00:23:36.339]  We're just saying it's being reported.
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:54.128]  How does he duck in with a gun into the woods, into shrubs, into a big divider of trees, and they reported calmly, and then
[00:23:55.885 --> 00:23:58.646]  Get a line of sight on Trump and reportedly start firing?
[00:23:58.906 --> 00:23:59.947]  We're not sure.
[00:23:59.987 --> 00:24:00.667]  Shots were fired.
[00:24:00.907 --> 00:24:04.169]  And the Secret Service either returned fire or saw him aiming the gun and shot at him.
[00:24:04.529 --> 00:24:12.933]  And then he left the gun and ran back out and the witness that saw him go in and saw him come out, they saw all this crap, and pointed what car it was the police that were already rolling up.
[00:24:13.774 --> 00:24:15.394]  And look, I'm not gonna even attack the police.
[00:24:15.414 --> 00:24:24.879]  When you're having to protect, let's put that back on screen, this gigantic area with post offices and schools and grocery stores and condos and mansions,
[00:24:26.929 --> 00:24:27.569]  All around it.
[00:24:29.151 --> 00:24:30.111]  Shopping centers.
[00:24:30.672 --> 00:24:33.053]  I mean, this is the richest area now in the United States.
[00:24:33.113 --> 00:24:34.675]  Used to be New York, it's now there.
[00:24:34.695 --> 00:24:36.776]  Everybody, the rich people in New York moved there.
[00:24:38.297 --> 00:24:38.958]  That's where they moved.
[00:24:38.978 --> 00:24:40.479]  Trump first did it 35 years ago.
[00:24:41.719 --> 00:24:43.681]  It was pretty much run down when he went and did it.
[00:24:43.721 --> 00:24:44.481]  He built it up.
[00:24:45.402 --> 00:24:50.125]  But the point is, is that how the hell do you defend that?
[00:24:52.767 --> 00:24:54.889]  How'd I sneak in Bohemian Grove 24 years ago?
[00:24:55.289 --> 00:24:56.310]  Right around the Secret Service.
[00:24:57.421 --> 00:24:59.222]  Because they it's a gorge.
[00:24:59.262 --> 00:25:00.662]  You only got one big entrance to it.
[00:25:01.403 --> 00:25:05.124]  And then Redwoods that go up and then it's literally thousand foot plus.
[00:25:05.184 --> 00:25:07.065]  You're already up in the in the hills, the mountains.
[00:25:07.765 --> 00:25:08.786]  So it's a mountain gorge.
[00:25:09.346 --> 00:25:13.108]  But I just slipped in and slipped around them because they'd have a solid perimeter.
[00:25:13.868 --> 00:25:19.150]  I had 150, maybe 120 yards to get through and I snuck right around them.
[00:25:20.731 --> 00:25:21.371]  I got footage of it.
[00:25:22.392 --> 00:25:22.592]  So
[00:25:24.349 --> 00:25:28.894]  That is undefendable unless they came in with an emergency.
[00:25:28.954 --> 00:25:29.534]  He's not the president.
[00:25:29.554 --> 00:25:30.035]  He can't do it.
[00:25:31.797 --> 00:25:33.078]  And shut the area down.
[00:25:35.541 --> 00:25:36.421]  Trump shouldn't do that.
[00:25:37.322 --> 00:25:41.427]  He should pick one of his golf courses that has a resort area in the corner of it.
[00:25:41.667 --> 00:25:42.267]  They have those.
[00:25:42.308 --> 00:25:43.369]  He owns a bunch of golf courses.
[00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:50.793]  It's got a mansion on it that can be defended and encircled with no major roads around it so that people can't bring truck bombs in.
[00:25:51.473 --> 00:25:54.435]  And then that's not even safe because they can hijack a jet and fly it into them.
[00:25:56.496 --> 00:25:58.857]  So he needs to be in a bunker.
[00:26:00.218 --> 00:26:04.640]  Not on the news, Trump's back at Mar-a-Lago and everybody knows he plays golf every day.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:10.283]  And then this guy, and there are police and Secret Service all over the place, patrolling back and forth.
[00:26:12.503 --> 00:26:16.305]  Pulls up, parks his SUV, and then magically knows how to run in the woods.
[00:26:16.625 --> 00:26:17.706]  And I've looked it up.
[00:26:18.526 --> 00:26:22.008]  They do question anybody that pulls a car off and parks it, usually within a few minutes.
[00:26:23.849 --> 00:26:31.693]  So, he wasn't like checking here and checking there and pulling over here and running over there and looking for Trump on a giant golf course, 18 holes.
[00:26:32.734 --> 00:26:33.514]  I live on one, folks.
[00:26:33.534 --> 00:26:40.858]  Believe me, it'd be hard for me to, you know, just know somebody's playing golf at some time and then just drive around on the roads looking and hoping I see them.
[00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.251]  Especially when there's these big shrubs that are solid.
[00:26:44.591 --> 00:26:50.734]  I've seen shots from the ground, they're just these big trees that start at the bottom, those Roman-style trees, I forget their name, and they're just, it's solid.
[00:26:50.954 --> 00:26:53.055]  So the neighbors don't have to see it, and the golf balls don't hit them.
[00:26:55.335 --> 00:26:57.797]  So, and so the golfers have privacy.
[00:26:58.637 --> 00:27:02.278]  And so this guy knew right where to pop in, and nobody else is pointing that out.
[00:27:02.418 --> 00:27:03.619]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:27:04.699 --> 00:27:08.941]  Just like with crooks, the whole stand down, them protecting him, him running around the roof forever.
[00:27:09.822 --> 00:27:10.582]  It's ridiculous.
[00:27:12.375 --> 00:27:21.361]  I'm gonna get a cup of coffee, and I'm gonna come back and lay through all this, but we can obsess over the new assassination attempt in the details all day.
[00:27:21.961 --> 00:27:25.584]  You're an idiot if you don't think the Deep State bare minimum told this guy where to go.
[00:27:26.845 --> 00:27:28.546]  Now, I notice you're seeing a press conference right away.
[00:27:28.806 --> 00:27:30.147]  You never saw one in Butler, did you?
[00:27:30.187 --> 00:27:31.328]  Because that was a total setup.
[00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:38.333]  This guy just got told where to be, guaranteed had an earpiece or a phone, but the FBI's gonna be in control of that phone.
[00:27:38.413 --> 00:27:39.213]  Who told him where to be?
[00:27:39.273 --> 00:27:40.654]  Who guided him to what spot?
[00:27:41.294 --> 00:27:49.458]  They need to check all his GPS, his phone record, how many times he's been back to the golf course, who'd he meet with, but the Justice Department's gonna run and control this, so you'll never see that.
[00:27:50.619 --> 00:27:51.119]  We'll be right back.
[00:27:51.139 --> 00:27:52.560]  Stay with us.
[00:28:06.785 --> 00:28:11.908]  All right, we are back live on this Sunday, September 15th, 2024 broadcast.
[00:28:12.048 --> 00:28:13.309]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:28:15.567 --> 00:28:22.953]  All right, I'm gonna break down what's happening, and I'm gonna just tell you right now, and I know this audience gets it, but we need to take everybody watching and listening.
[00:28:23.653 --> 00:28:34.321]  You should take the feed from X at Real Alex Jones and share it on your email, your text message, on X, everywhere, on Facebook, everywhere else, and infowars.com.
[00:28:34.541 --> 00:28:38.024]  That's how we reach more people, and you've been doing that lately.
[00:28:39.266 --> 00:28:42.327]  And so we had 15 million people watch the debate on our feed.
[00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:46.648]  We had 40 million watch Friday's show on X out of our five feeds.
[00:28:46.749 --> 00:28:47.569]  One had 30 million.
[00:28:47.809 --> 00:28:51.850]  The rest totaled 40 million as of this morning.
[00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.871]  40 million people clicked on the video.
[00:28:54.791 --> 00:28:55.271]  That's you.
[00:28:55.511 --> 00:28:55.952]  You did that.
[00:28:56.912 --> 00:28:58.612]  So go to the live feed right now.
[00:28:59.893 --> 00:29:02.994]  We'll show it to you on X. I put out like five headlines with a live feed in it.
[00:29:04.795 --> 00:29:06.757]  And we're going to educate and brief America here.
[00:29:07.717 --> 00:29:09.579]  CNN's top shows have 1 million viewers.
[00:29:10.019 --> 00:29:11.300]  Their smaller show has 80,000.
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.961]  Just understand, they're a joke.
[00:29:13.301 --> 00:29:14.462]  The corporate media is dead.
[00:29:14.502 --> 00:29:17.805]  They have no power anymore, except the power you give them in your mind.
[00:29:18.866 --> 00:29:22.809]  Now, I say this to the audience.
[00:29:22.829 --> 00:29:27.272]  I know most of the audience knows this, but for new viewers, this is not a Netflix true crime drama.
[00:29:27.873 --> 00:29:29.574]  This is not a Netflix fiction show.
[00:29:29.674 --> 00:29:30.835]  This is not Lord of the Rings.
[00:29:33.902 --> 00:29:38.405]  This is, this is, this is the real world on this planet.
[00:29:38.605 --> 00:29:41.267]  My life, your life, our lives, our children's lives together.
[00:29:43.108 --> 00:29:48.551]  But now, this did not happen 50 days out from the election by accident.
[00:29:48.591 --> 00:29:50.172]  Just like Butler didn't happen by accident.
[00:29:50.192 --> 00:29:52.494]  The cover-up and the lies and the stand-down and everything else.
[00:29:54.095 --> 00:29:58.658]  And it's a no-brainer that they're gonna try again and again and again and again and again to kill Trump.
[00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:08.513]  And they asked in the press conference that's still ongoing, well, why didn't he have a Secret Service guard in the golf course?
[00:30:08.533 --> 00:30:09.613]  Well, he's not the president.
[00:30:09.973 --> 00:30:11.074]  He gets a small number.
[00:30:13.434 --> 00:30:19.437]  And he supposedly has Army Special Operations, former people, there's no such thing, that are guarding him as well.
[00:30:20.157 --> 00:30:21.357]  Well, didn't work, did it?
[00:30:21.617 --> 00:30:22.918]  A private citizen stopped it.
[00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:28.420]  Like they tried to stop it in Butler, but the Secret Service sat there while the guy ran around on the roof.
[00:30:30.623 --> 00:30:31.583]  For 26 minutes.
[00:30:32.844 --> 00:30:34.564]  I ran around with a rifle for six minutes.
[00:30:35.044 --> 00:30:35.665]  He's got a gun!
[00:30:35.685 --> 00:30:36.265]  He's got a gun!
[00:30:36.285 --> 00:30:36.945]  He's got a gun!
[00:30:36.965 --> 00:30:42.487]  You can see on cameras from behind Trump, the guy crawling around up there with a naked eye.
[00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:44.327]  150 yards away.
[00:30:44.347 --> 00:30:52.090]  And now this guy drops in on a giant, huge golf course that has some huge thoroughways.
[00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:54.071]  You know, huge 200, 300-yard holes.
[00:30:54.091 --> 00:30:54.271]  Gigantic.
[00:30:59.824 --> 00:31:03.585]  And he just knows right where to drop in where Trump is and tries to kill him.
[00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:15.388]  So this, ladies and gentlemen, is history happening right now.
[00:31:15.408 --> 00:31:19.009]  Now there's video crooks running around on the roof.
[00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.370]  So this is a joke.
[00:31:28.411 --> 00:31:29.191]  How bad this is.
[00:31:32.415 --> 00:31:33.476]  So they've done it again.
[00:31:33.516 --> 00:31:34.597]  They will do it again.
[00:31:34.617 --> 00:31:40.121]  And I made a big deal about it that Trump should not be parading around in front of everybody.
[00:31:41.482 --> 00:31:42.203]  People understand him.
[00:31:42.223 --> 00:31:43.644]  He says, look, they keep trying to kill me.
[00:31:43.684 --> 00:31:44.805]  I've got to get in as a president.
[00:31:44.825 --> 00:31:45.906]  I don't control the Secret Service.
[00:31:45.926 --> 00:31:46.686]  I don't have protection.
[00:31:48.127 --> 00:31:57.575]  And he can digitally dominate and do fireside chats every night and do roundtable interviews and invite all the independent media there that's bigger than the mainstream media that's not mainstream.
[00:31:59.102 --> 00:32:02.204]  He should do Elon Musk updates every few days with a billion viewers.
[00:32:02.244 --> 00:32:03.425]  Instead, there's J.D.
[00:32:03.445 --> 00:32:06.887]  Vance is on CNN half the time talking to their million viewers, getting beat up by him.
[00:32:06.907 --> 00:32:07.708]  I mean, it's a joke!
[00:32:08.528 --> 00:32:12.031]  And the corporate media is talking about... Laura Loomer.
[00:32:12.731 --> 00:32:14.552]  Nothing against Laura, but, you know, my God.
[00:32:16.934 --> 00:32:18.435]  But this should not happen in a vacuum.
[00:32:20.612 --> 00:32:27.877]  Wednesday, the British say we've been given a green light to start bombing inside Russia with high-power, precision-guided, U.S.-made missiles.
[00:32:27.917 --> 00:32:29.779]  They put the explosives in in Europe.
[00:32:30.319 --> 00:32:30.739]  The U.K.
[00:32:30.819 --> 00:32:31.440]  owns the company.
[00:32:32.721 --> 00:32:33.401]  Storm Shadow.
[00:32:34.262 --> 00:32:40.006]  You can fire them from 1,000 miles away, the ones they're getting them to, like, 500.
[00:32:40.466 --> 00:32:41.847]  You can hit a postage stamp with it.
[00:32:43.108 --> 00:32:48.011]  You can sit there and stand there in a field with your mouth open, and they can drop the missile right into your mouth.
[00:32:48.632 --> 00:32:49.953]  The nose cone would hit you right in the teeth.
[00:32:51.952 --> 00:32:55.554]  So, Russia has said that'll be an act of war.
[00:32:55.594 --> 00:32:57.296]  They told the UN that on Friday.
[00:32:57.316 --> 00:33:05.681]  And Biden, on Friday, came out in the Leningrad and New York Times, said, well, yeah, we just don't want the blame for it, but we give the authorization.
[00:33:06.061 --> 00:33:07.942]  Trudeau came out and said, yep, it's all authorized.
[00:33:08.423 --> 00:33:09.543]  And so, will it start tomorrow?
[00:33:09.563 --> 00:33:10.224]  Will it start today?
[00:33:10.264 --> 00:33:11.064]  Will it start next week?
[00:33:11.445 --> 00:33:12.465]  How will the Russians respond?
[00:33:16.108 --> 00:33:21.191]  Got a guy with his backpack and his, you know, gun and all the rest of it with his scope.
[00:33:22.739 --> 00:33:24.861]  They said it was an AK-47 type rifle.
[00:33:25.941 --> 00:33:27.923]  The clip, the magazine looks like one.
[00:33:29.064 --> 00:33:31.105]  But, I don't know.
[00:33:32.546 --> 00:33:37.970]  The rest of the rifles, I'd look at a Dragunov, or whatever those Russian-style sniper ones are.
[00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:42.193]  There are a lot of those sold on the market here in the United States.
[00:33:46.116 --> 00:33:47.096]  Not the rifle I'd use.
[00:33:47.777 --> 00:33:49.878]  But, thank God these guys aren't using .300 Win Mags.
[00:33:54.405 --> 00:33:59.346]  338 Lapua or some of the others.
[00:33:59.366 --> 00:34:04.908]  I know there's some smaller rounds people like, but I like a 300 Win Mag.
[00:34:04.928 --> 00:34:10.169]  I can shoot mountain goats at 800 yards all day, never miss.
[00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:16.151]  But, thank God, they're not using a real rifle.
[00:34:17.611 --> 00:34:20.472]  But, that's what these people think are good.
[00:34:22.753 --> 00:34:22.953]  So,
[00:34:24.815 --> 00:34:25.336]  Here we are.
[00:34:26.456 --> 00:34:28.197]  And the Secret Service fired at him and stopped him.
[00:34:30.579 --> 00:34:31.659]  But I'm going to say it again.
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.001]  They wanted to get Trump out of the way before full war with Russia.
[00:34:35.862 --> 00:34:37.943]  And I just cannot believe we're in this position.
[00:34:38.003 --> 00:34:39.724]  I cannot believe things are this serious.
[00:34:41.745 --> 00:34:45.207]  I keep telling my family, who are dialed in and smart, they knew about the stuff before I was born.
[00:34:45.787 --> 00:34:47.348]  They're still just going to the movies.
[00:34:47.388 --> 00:34:48.649]  And, oh, Alex, don't worry about it.
[00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:49.970]  Hey, let's go on a trip.
[00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:52.171]  Let's go on a Caribbean trip next week.
[00:34:52.271 --> 00:34:53.352]  No, not happening.
[00:34:54.485 --> 00:35:04.932]  I'm going to Reading next week with Tucker and Jack Pesso because it's key and it's key to reach those people and it'll be on the podcast that probably reach 30 million people.
[00:35:05.332 --> 00:35:05.932]  So I'm doing that.
[00:35:07.513 --> 00:35:14.558]  But after that, I'm done for the election because I need to stay right where I'm at to report on this because I can reach tens of millions a day.
[00:35:16.118 --> 00:35:18.880]  And there's no danger at that rally, obviously.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.581]  It's Trump that's the target.
[00:35:20.621 --> 00:35:28.546]  But my point is, is that I can sit here digitally, morning, noon, and night, just like we do and Steve Bannon does, emulating us.
[00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:29.487]  And I love the fact that he does that.
[00:35:29.507 --> 00:35:30.667]  He'll be out of jail hopefully soon.
[00:35:31.208 --> 00:35:32.629]  They've neutralized him for all this.
[00:35:32.989 --> 00:35:34.810]  Tried to take us off the air 10 weeks ago, remember?
[00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:35.891]  Outside of court order.
[00:35:36.963 --> 00:35:40.047]  Total vigilanteism by the Justice Department for the bankruptcy system.
[00:35:40.067 --> 00:35:40.788]  The judge shut them down.
[00:35:41.249 --> 00:35:43.071]  I mean, that's how desperate they are.
[00:35:43.471 --> 00:35:48.237]  And when they tried to shut us down without a court order 10 weeks ago, when we came here to lock the place and said, we don't need an order.
[00:35:48.558 --> 00:35:49.139]  Get out of the way.
[00:35:49.159 --> 00:35:50.080]  I said, no, I'm not.
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:50.761]  I'm calling the police.
[00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:54.773]  People said that can't be true, that sounds insane.
[00:35:54.793 --> 00:35:56.015]  But later it came out in the news, they did that.
[00:35:56.155 --> 00:35:57.136]  Reuters AP was proud of it.
[00:35:57.156 --> 00:35:58.158]  Oh yeah, yeah, they tried to shut down.
[00:35:58.458 --> 00:36:00.040]  Jones didn't let them, but we'll shut it down soon.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.663]  It wasn't about me.
[00:36:01.683 --> 00:36:03.325]  I said they're getting ready to kill Trump!
[00:36:04.026 --> 00:36:08.732]  I mean, that's not a hard thing to... They got the Justice Department trying to shut us down without a court order?
[00:36:08.792 --> 00:36:09.654]  Not even a piece of paper?
[00:36:14.744 --> 00:36:16.006]  I got physically ill when that happened.
[00:36:16.027 --> 00:36:17.309]  I started throwing up all over the place.
[00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:18.311]  The crew was like, what's wrong?
[00:36:18.752 --> 00:36:20.675]  Laura Logan was here the next day after it was happening.
[00:36:20.896 --> 00:36:21.517]  They tried again.
[00:36:21.537 --> 00:36:22.458]  She said, why are you so upset?
[00:36:22.479 --> 00:36:23.340]  I said, they're going to kill Trump.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:23.741]  I said, I don't know.
[00:36:23.761 --> 00:36:24.462]  They're going to kill Trump.
[00:36:24.482 --> 00:36:25.184]  It's imminent.
[00:36:25.224 --> 00:36:25.544]  It's imminent.
[00:36:25.564 --> 00:36:26.326]  That's why they did this.
[00:36:26.366 --> 00:36:27.328]  I mean, I'm not stupid.
[00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:41.843]  You're a sentry on a parapet at a castle a thousand years ago, and you see some movement in the edge of the woods there, and all of a sudden, seven arrows shoot past you, shoot the other sentry in the head, and one grazes you in the arm.
[00:36:42.483 --> 00:36:43.804]  You don't go, oh, poor me!
[00:36:44.084 --> 00:36:44.885]  Somebody tried to hurt me!
[00:36:44.925 --> 00:36:46.105]  You start ringing the alarm bell.
[00:36:46.145 --> 00:36:47.586]  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing!
[00:36:47.626 --> 00:36:48.907]  You light the emergency torch.
[00:36:49.127 --> 00:36:51.289]  You say, probable invasion!
[00:36:51.649 --> 00:36:56.012]  And sure enough, by the time your forces rally, 20,000 people come out of the woods.
[00:36:56.092 --> 00:36:57.213]  Raaar!
[00:36:57.553 --> 00:36:58.013]  Ladders!
[00:36:58.594 --> 00:37:00.235]  Trying to come over the walls, man!
[00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:04.538]  Those arrows came in here and barely missed us.
[00:37:04.558 --> 00:37:05.799]  We almost got shut down.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.721]  The Justice Department had to bluff its way to take us off air.
[00:37:08.961 --> 00:37:10.242]  I didn't go, boy, I'm important.
[00:37:10.563 --> 00:37:13.425]  I meant they're getting ready to kill Trump because I'm a sentry.
[00:37:13.785 --> 00:37:16.627]  I'm a Paul Revere on the parapet at 2 a.m.
[00:37:16.647 --> 00:37:18.989]  And I see in the shadows movement.
[00:37:19.029 --> 00:37:21.991]  I'm looking over 60 yards all of a sudden.
[00:37:30.814 --> 00:37:32.095]  The border's overrun.
[00:37:32.195 --> 00:37:33.275]  Everything's overrun.
[00:37:33.335 --> 00:37:34.716]  America is under attack.
[00:37:36.717 --> 00:37:38.978]  But it's a new type of asymmetrical warfare.
[00:37:39.018 --> 00:37:43.160]  It's not Nazi Germany and army tanks or the Soviet Union and missiles.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.301]  It's the New World Order bombing you with poison shots.
[00:37:47.542 --> 00:37:48.963]  Bombing you with poison culture.
[00:37:49.003 --> 00:37:50.684]  Bombing you with devalued currency.
[00:37:52.084 --> 00:37:52.805]  Bombing you.
[00:37:53.045 --> 00:37:53.945]  Attacking you.
[00:37:54.305 --> 00:37:55.086]  Lying to you.
[00:37:55.506 --> 00:37:56.266]  Savaging you.
[00:37:56.306 --> 00:37:57.147]  They're enemies.
[00:37:58.012 --> 00:38:00.594]  That's why Kamala said, I've never wanted gun control Tuesday.
[00:38:00.614 --> 00:38:03.717]  And then she came out officially and said, we want to ban all your semi-autos Saturday.
[00:38:05.618 --> 00:38:07.260]  Even though she said before she wants to ban them all.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:07.960]  She goes, you're crazy.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:08.721]  I never said that.
[00:38:09.061 --> 00:38:10.162]  Like Tim Walz hunts.
[00:38:11.243 --> 00:38:13.044]  Four days later, I'm going to ban your guns.
[00:38:13.805 --> 00:38:14.445]  Why does she do that?
[00:38:14.686 --> 00:38:16.427]  Because it's disrespecting you.
[00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.172]  Yep, there he is coming up to the edge of the shrubs, the trees.
[00:38:24.534 --> 00:38:25.775]  Knew right where Trump was.
[00:38:27.247 --> 00:38:36.951]  Trump was, again, at hole five when it happened, going to hole six, and he knew right where to pull up.
[00:38:37.571 --> 00:38:39.912]  And that road's just full of police and Secret Service.
[00:38:40.992 --> 00:38:41.953]  I've talked to folks that are there.
[00:38:41.973 --> 00:38:42.553]  I've looked at them.
[00:38:42.633 --> 00:38:46.414]  I mean, you're talking—one's rolling by every 30 seconds, back and forth.
[00:38:47.055 --> 00:38:48.375]  If you look at—I've seen the newscast.
[00:38:48.615 --> 00:38:52.897]  You'll just see constantly three or four police cars driving up the road, back and forth, back and forth, turning around.
[00:38:53.357 --> 00:38:54.137]  Imagine that job.
[00:38:54.157 --> 00:38:55.878]  It's all day, back and forth, back and forth.
[00:38:56.846 --> 00:39:06.050]  Anybody pulls over and stops, gets in the woods, you'd say, oh, this guy, he just magically knew right where to pull up and right where to pop out.
[00:39:06.991 --> 00:39:11.553]  Again, I've said it a hundred times or more, the average Secret Service man is a good person.
[00:39:12.713 --> 00:39:14.874]  And they're the ones that can get shot for Trump.
[00:39:14.894 --> 00:39:16.135]  They're the ones that are there shielding him.
[00:39:16.155 --> 00:39:17.095]  They're the ones that care.
[00:39:17.555 --> 00:39:19.536]  They shot back, they shot at the guy.
[00:39:21.077 --> 00:39:22.678]  And he pops out of the woods with his rifle.
[00:39:24.058 --> 00:39:24.839]  Which looks like a
[00:39:26.476 --> 00:39:27.356]  Put it back on screen.
[00:39:27.376 --> 00:39:31.178]  It's in the shadows, but I know why they're calling it AK-47 stock, because it's got the banana.
[00:39:32.898 --> 00:39:33.398]  Magazine.
[00:39:34.799 --> 00:39:35.599]  Clip, as it's called.
[00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:37.920]  Popular nomenclature, but it's a magazine.
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.421]  And it looks like a, was it Drag-Off?
[00:39:42.161 --> 00:39:42.501]  Yeah.
[00:39:43.402 --> 00:39:44.202]  I've never owned one.
[00:39:44.242 --> 00:39:44.902]  I've shot one.
[00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:48.563]  Looks like it's even got the little Russian scope on it.
[00:39:50.584 --> 00:39:51.524]  Not a piece of crap.
[00:39:51.544 --> 00:39:52.485]  I mean, it's not bad.
[00:39:52.505 --> 00:39:53.125]  It's just not a .301 mag.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:04.045]  So, and are they going to say he's a Russian?
[00:40:04.065 --> 00:40:06.707]  Are they going to say he's a Iranian?
[00:40:08.128 --> 00:40:10.049]  They've got these stories all pre-programmed.
[00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:21.437]  But the big takeaway here is, is Trump going to stop acting like a fish in a barrel
[00:40:23.274 --> 00:40:27.936]  Or that he's at the carnival and he's one of the targets you sit there and you shoot at with the BB guns.
[00:40:30.198 --> 00:40:31.838]  You know, they've had them since I was a kid.
[00:40:31.999 --> 00:40:35.120]  You go to the carnival and they put the little piece of paper up there with a red star.
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.841]  You gotta shoot it just perfectly all out to win a prize.
[00:40:39.202 --> 00:40:41.784]  The secret is you don't shoot the star itself, you shoot in a circle around it.
[00:40:42.444 --> 00:40:46.046]  They always get mad because I just win and win and win and win and win and win and win.
[00:40:46.086 --> 00:40:52.169]  They put a whole strip of, it's like a clip of BBs and they load it in and it's air powered.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.685]  Does this Trump, like, wanna be like the piece of paper with the red star on it at the carnival?
[00:40:58.385 --> 00:40:59.366]  Because that's what he is.
[00:40:59.386 --> 00:41:04.611]  I mean, maybe he likes getting shot at.
[00:41:06.694 --> 00:41:10.758]  But I'm gonna be really upset when they kill him and they just try it again.
[00:41:12.182 --> 00:41:14.663]  And if you think it's going to be two months until they try again, think again.
[00:41:15.003 --> 00:41:17.825]  They got people lined up for two days from now, next week.
[00:41:18.385 --> 00:41:19.745]  They got people swarming around.
[00:41:20.586 --> 00:41:30.390]  They're just waiting to have some driver or somebody that works with one of these reporters, be a Trump supporter, mainstream media matter, that get on Air Force One.
[00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:32.811]  Trump should not have the press corps on his airplane.
[00:41:34.232 --> 00:41:36.713]  Everyone should be double-searched when they come on.
[00:41:37.961 --> 00:42:02.578]  Because all it takes is a half pound of plastic explosives, or two pounds, or a pound, woven into the inside of a purse, inside the lining, and then the plane's taking off, perfect time, and all you do is dial the cell phone, doot, doot, doot, doot, call, and when the call goes through, fuselage blows out, it'll probably detonate at about 3,000 feet to get a good, good crash.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.181]  You ready for Trump?
[00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:07.222]  You ready to wake up?
[00:42:08.251 --> 00:42:12.973]  Are you ready to be at work at lunch and everybody starts running around going, oh, President Trump's plane went down.
[00:42:13.853 --> 00:42:14.474]  You ready for that?
[00:42:15.554 --> 00:42:17.955]  Ready to hear, oh, a big explosion at Mar-a-Lago.
[00:42:17.995 --> 00:42:18.636]  You ready for that?
[00:42:20.736 --> 00:42:21.337]  You ready for that?
[00:42:24.718 --> 00:42:29.620]  Because that's what you're going to be watching, and you're going to be seeing, and he'll be dead.
[00:42:32.141 --> 00:42:35.363]  And then they're going to stage a bunch of false flags and say right-wingers in response to it.
[00:42:36.633 --> 00:42:40.414]  And this is all very easy to know what's going on.
[00:42:40.474 --> 00:42:44.374]  I'm sitting here like telling you what's going to happen if Trump doesn't stop.
[00:42:47.715 --> 00:42:51.616]  Do I have to get on an airplane and find his schedule and go make a huge scene?
[00:42:56.997 --> 00:42:58.537]  I've been thinking about what I'm gonna have to pull.
[00:43:02.818 --> 00:43:03.878]  God, do I have to do everything?
[00:43:07.853 --> 00:43:09.614]  So, I mean, I don't know what to say.
[00:43:09.634 --> 00:43:10.655]  I got Don Jr.'
[00:43:10.635 --> 00:43:12.556]  's number, and I've called these people.
[00:43:12.636 --> 00:43:13.937]  I could call up and yell at them, I guess.
[00:43:13.997 --> 00:43:14.837]  I've been nice so far.
[00:43:14.857 --> 00:43:18.839]  I mean, do you want your dad's blown-off head in your hands?
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:20.300]  I know you don't.
[00:43:21.981 --> 00:43:23.642]  So, you can only tempt fate so many times.
[00:43:23.682 --> 00:43:24.683]  God's hand is on Trump.
[00:43:25.563 --> 00:43:28.125]  But Hunter S. Thompson said, trust in God, but we're away from the rocks.
[00:43:28.165 --> 00:43:30.066]  The Bedouins say, trust in God, but type your camel.
[00:43:30.666 --> 00:43:33.568]  God helps those that help themselves, and
[00:43:35.967 --> 00:43:38.628]  We have mad men running the country and they're totally at war with us.
[00:43:39.409 --> 00:43:42.730]  And Trump needs to be very direct with people that are trying to kill him.
[00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:44.051]  And twice is enough.
[00:43:44.751 --> 00:43:45.892]  And he needs to go digital.
[00:43:47.392 --> 00:43:49.173]  He needs to decide where he's going to move and when.
[00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:51.554]  Not tell people until like an hour before.
[00:43:55.516 --> 00:43:57.377]  Because next they're going to hit his motorcade with a truck bomb.
[00:43:58.197 --> 00:43:59.938]  Look, the Secret Service knows the route he takes.
[00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:02.959]  That'll be given to Merrick Garland.
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:04.200]  Or Mayorkas.
[00:44:06.937 --> 00:44:12.601]  Look, I guarantee you, they got truck bombs with plastic explosives loaded up right now.
[00:44:13.481 --> 00:44:26.229]  All they gotta do is park one in a garage on Trump's route, and he's driving by 50 feet away from it on the road, and they go, bloop!
[00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:32.874]  And then his armored sedan will roll five or six times,
[00:44:35.034 --> 00:44:37.315]  And he will, bare minimum, be seriously brain damaged.
[00:44:37.415 --> 00:44:39.976]  Ask the troops that get blown up by IEDs how it feels.
[00:44:40.596 --> 00:44:41.716]  And it's gonna be a lot bigger than that.
[00:44:44.257 --> 00:44:45.278]  So he might survive that.
[00:44:46.698 --> 00:44:48.839]  Or they shoot down his airplane and say the Iranians did it.
[00:44:49.919 --> 00:44:50.960]  With a surface-to-air missile.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.401]  You know they're trying to poison his food.
[00:44:53.441 --> 00:44:54.481]  I know he takes precautions for that.
[00:44:54.841 --> 00:44:56.162]  He's worried about that for a while.
[00:44:56.182 --> 00:44:58.723]  He'll randomly tell his staff, go get 20 cheeseburgers.
[00:44:58.763 --> 00:45:00.023]  And he looks at them all and picks one.
[00:45:02.084 --> 00:45:02.264]  So...
[00:45:03.839 --> 00:45:06.663]  Or he has trusted people at Mar-a-Lago that he comes, he picks the steak.
[00:45:07.684 --> 00:45:08.745]  You've seen it on footage.
[00:45:08.785 --> 00:45:09.946]  And he goes, oh, I want that one.
[00:45:09.966 --> 00:45:10.807]  And he watches them cook it.
[00:45:11.348 --> 00:45:12.489]  Watches them make a spaghetti.
[00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:14.611]  His fettuccine alfredo.
[00:45:14.932 --> 00:45:15.692]  His lobster tails.
[00:45:16.053 --> 00:45:17.014]  Where he goes to buffets.
[00:45:18.255 --> 00:45:20.177]  He knows buffets are going at Mar-a-Lago all the time.
[00:45:20.938 --> 00:45:21.919]  He goes to other golf courses too.
[00:45:21.939 --> 00:45:22.960]  And he just shows up unannounced.
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.302]  He goes right up to the thing himself.
[00:45:26.806 --> 00:45:27.246]  Breaking.
[00:45:27.366 --> 00:45:34.629]  Eric Prince, founder of the private security firm Blackwater, calls on Florida Governor DeSantis to immediately assume control of the investigation in the second prepossessation attempt.
[00:45:34.669 --> 00:45:40.271]  He adds, the feds have dropped the ball thoroughly on Butler PA at the time for Florida to save the day.
[00:45:41.512 --> 00:45:41.952]  Damn right.
[00:45:41.972 --> 00:45:44.333]  Print me that.
[00:45:44.353 --> 00:45:44.333]  100%.
[00:45:44.393 --> 00:45:46.273]  I mean, that's a nice way of saying it.
[00:45:46.293 --> 00:45:50.675]  You know this was quarterbacked by Merrick Garland.
[00:45:50.735 --> 00:45:51.675]  Guaranteed. 100%.
[00:45:54.346 --> 00:45:57.488]  They used a couple of cutouts to, you know, tell the guy where to be.
[00:45:58.208 --> 00:45:59.189]  He was so coordinated.
[00:45:59.549 --> 00:46:01.150]  He was riding around in the area ready.
[00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:02.731]  They probably drilled it a few times.
[00:46:03.212 --> 00:46:06.334]  His source says, all right, go to zone such and such.
[00:46:06.994 --> 00:46:08.195]  He's got it marked on his GPS.
[00:46:08.435 --> 00:46:08.855]  Pulls up.
[00:46:09.456 --> 00:46:10.256]  There's Trump right there.
[00:46:10.636 --> 00:46:11.437]  Pops out with a gun.
[00:46:12.157 --> 00:46:13.338]  Secret Service start firing at him.
[00:46:13.358 --> 00:46:14.259]  We're not sure if he fired.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:17.641]  And the rest is history.
[00:46:18.281 --> 00:46:19.802]  I mean, precision.
[00:46:21.843 --> 00:46:22.604]  Precision.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:31.202]  Would you know how to just pull up at Trump's giant golf course and just randomly walk in the woods, and there he is, while the cops are driving back and forth the Secret Service, who do their jobs and would run over?
[00:46:31.962 --> 00:46:36.523]  They were there when he runs out of the woods, gets in the car, and the guy goes, that's him, that's the guy, he had a gun!
[00:46:37.083 --> 00:46:41.744]  So they got him, because somebody's like, hey, there's a guy right there, like they did in Butler, hey, he's on the roof, there he is!
[00:46:41.984 --> 00:46:44.225]  Nothing's done for six, seven minutes, hey, he's got a gun!
[00:46:44.365 --> 00:46:46.625]  Everybody's running, he's got a gun, run, he's got a gun!
[00:46:48.986 --> 00:46:50.266]  Local police were locked.
[00:46:52.113 --> 00:46:56.297]  Behind the fence and not allowed in and had to ram through it when Trump got shot?
[00:46:56.937 --> 00:46:58.038]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.481]  This isn't coincidences.
[00:47:08.556 --> 00:47:10.479]  So here's what I'm going to do.
[00:47:10.619 --> 00:47:18.992]  I'm going to, just so it's on record, I'm going to play all the CNN clips admitting it was an assassination attempt in the press conference and go over all the news and the background of it.
[00:47:19.012 --> 00:47:22.898]  And then we're going to join a Spaces with Mario Fall, one with Nick Santor.
[00:47:24.186 --> 00:47:25.526]  They've had millions on there as well.
[00:47:25.766 --> 00:47:26.707]  It's good to join the streams.
[00:47:27.427 --> 00:47:28.767]  Contrary to what Ghostbuster says.
[00:47:29.767 --> 00:47:32.148]  And then, cross the streams.
[00:47:33.308 --> 00:47:35.889]  And then, we'll continue on to 8 o'clock tonight at least.
[00:47:36.649 --> 00:47:38.050]  But now they're gonna really be desperate.
[00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:39.550]  And so it's not a hard prediction.
[00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:42.031]  It is a probable probability.
[00:47:43.371 --> 00:47:44.491]  And pretty much a guarantee.
[00:47:45.291 --> 00:47:47.812]  That they will now accelerate the timetable for killing Trump.
[00:47:50.287 --> 00:47:51.829]  And they definitely don't want Trump and J.D.
[00:47:51.869 --> 00:47:53.951]  Mance at the same place at the same time.
[00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:58.976]  So, that's where we are.
[00:48:00.057 --> 00:48:02.800]  And it's the backdrop of the missiles that start raining down on Russia.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.042]  And it could happen next hour.
[00:48:04.062 --> 00:48:05.283]  It could happen two weeks from now.
[00:48:05.363 --> 00:48:05.683]  I don't know.
[00:48:06.424 --> 00:48:07.065]  It's all confirmed.
[00:48:07.085 --> 00:48:07.545]  The U.S.
[00:48:07.585 --> 00:48:08.847]  government's going to greenlit.
[00:48:14.397 --> 00:48:25.361]  Inside Russia, with giant cruise missiles, blow up whole blocks, blow up whole military barracks, whole airfields, large portions of it.
[00:48:28.282 --> 00:48:32.884]  So, that's where we are, with 50 days left to the election.
[00:48:33.937 --> 00:48:36.139]  And a lot of people, it's like entertainment now.
[00:48:36.479 --> 00:48:38.541]  Oh, a guy charged the stage and tried to jump on Trump.
[00:48:39.001 --> 00:48:40.422]  Oh God, another guy tried to kill him.
[00:48:40.483 --> 00:48:42.744]  Oh boy, this is better than a TV show.
[00:48:42.764 --> 00:48:47.288]  This is people that have enslaved the country, that are destroying the nation, trying to kill our leaders.
[00:48:47.308 --> 00:48:49.150]  We're trying to get control again and fix things.
[00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:50.731]  They just tried to kill him again.
[00:48:50.791 --> 00:48:52.092]  They just tried to kill your freedom.
[00:48:52.312 --> 00:48:53.393]  They just attacked you.
[00:48:53.673 --> 00:48:54.714]  Do you understand that?
[00:48:54.934 --> 00:48:56.095]  Do you take this personal?
[00:48:56.376 --> 00:48:57.817]  This is not a fucking game.
[00:49:07.546 --> 00:49:10.827]  All right, let me do this because we're gonna win, Trump's gonna be safer.
[00:49:10.847 --> 00:49:14.548]  I trust in God, God's hands on us, and we've gotta stay on air.
[00:49:15.769 --> 00:49:22.331]  Before I start the next hour, we had 40 million viewers on X, a Friday show.
[00:49:22.351 --> 00:49:24.131]  It wasn't just my show, it was the loop of all the shows.
[00:49:24.171 --> 00:49:25.452]  The network feed had 30 million.
[00:49:25.812 --> 00:49:28.613]  My show, you added up the other shows, there's over 40 million views of the shows Friday.
[00:49:30.953 --> 00:49:31.894]  But a loop of Harrison,
[00:49:32.805 --> 00:49:33.605]  Myself and Owen.
[00:49:34.406 --> 00:49:35.106]  30 million plus.
[00:49:35.647 --> 00:49:35.987]  Plus.
[00:49:36.607 --> 00:49:37.708]  And then others 10 million.
[00:49:38.588 --> 00:49:39.028]  40 plus million.
[00:49:40.449 --> 00:49:41.050]  And I'm not bitching.
[00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:41.430]  It's great.
[00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:43.131]  We did see some uptake in sales.
[00:49:43.171 --> 00:49:44.852]  We had millions and millions on InfoWars.
[00:49:44.872 --> 00:49:46.433]  But it's new listeners, folks.
[00:49:46.473 --> 00:49:47.473]  They don't buy crap.
[00:49:48.173 --> 00:49:53.416]  It is the original hardcore folks, you know who you are, that are supporters, that are responsible for the fact we're reaching so many people.
[00:49:53.476 --> 00:49:54.077]  I salute you.
[00:49:54.457 --> 00:49:54.997]  I thank you.
[00:49:55.037 --> 00:49:55.518]  Great job.
[00:49:55.818 --> 00:49:57.479]  And so I just ask you to continue.
[00:49:57.779 --> 00:49:59.740]  And I thank you and I appreciate the great products you need.

[00:53:31.834 --> 00:53:33.694]  So, it's exciting to wear these out in public.
[00:53:33.734 --> 00:53:34.935]  Most people will agree with you and love you.
[00:53:35.075 --> 00:53:35.975]  You'll meet so many friends.
[00:53:36.095 --> 00:53:37.576]  Go to thealexjonestore.com.
[00:53:37.596 --> 00:53:38.476]  We need your support.
[00:53:38.536 --> 00:53:39.156]  No excuses.
[00:53:39.196 --> 00:53:40.817]  Take action at thealexjonestore.com.
[00:53:40.837 --> 00:53:41.177]  Thank you.
[00:53:41.717 --> 00:53:44.558]  Enter to win right now at thealexjonestore.com.
[00:53:44.758 --> 00:53:50.300]  All right, I want to keep the focus some on
[00:53:51.923 --> 00:53:55.026]  In February of 2022, President Joe Biden threatened the Nord Stream Pipeline.
[00:53:55.046 --> 00:53:55.807]  If Russia invades,
[00:54:16.297 --> 00:54:23.079]  That means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again.
[00:54:23.099 --> 00:54:28.680]  Then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:33.921]  We will bring an end to it.
[00:54:34.221 --> 00:54:42.023]  How will you do that exactly, since the project and control of the project is within Germany's control?
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:46.301]  We will, I promise you, we'll be able to do it.
[00:54:47.301 --> 00:54:50.822]  One month later, he was a harbinger for World War III.
[00:54:51.462 --> 00:54:53.783]  We're showing the strength and we'll never falter.
[00:54:53.883 --> 00:55:10.588]  But look, the idea, the idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand and don't kid yourself, no matter what you all say, that's called World
[00:55:13.655 --> 00:55:13.996]  Okay.
[00:55:15.621 --> 00:55:17.125]  Let's get it straight here, guys.
[00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:23.253]  Six months later, the Nord Stream pipeline was destroyed by NATO forces.
[00:55:23.993 --> 00:55:27.875]  NATO forces who overthrew the Ukraine government 10 years ago.
[00:55:28.476 --> 00:55:36.040]  NATO forces who have been building bioweapons labs and missile systems along the Russian border for decades.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:44.945]  And now, NATO forces are discussing plans to deploy advanced long-range weapons to target deep into Russia.
[00:55:45.385 --> 00:55:49.107]  Which would most definitely trigger a full-scale war with Russia.
[00:55:49.807 --> 00:55:53.669]  Vladimir Putin responded yesterday to this major escalation.
[00:55:54.049 --> 00:55:59.571]  He said that... This is an attempt at manipulation.
[00:56:01.112 --> 00:56:07.234]  Because it is not about allowing or forbidding the Kiev regime from striking inside Russia.
[00:56:08.775 --> 00:56:13.237]  They're already doing that with drones, flying devices and other means.
[00:56:14.008 --> 00:56:27.278]  But when it comes to using AI-precision weapons, long-range Western-made ones, that's a completely different story.
[00:56:28.879 --> 00:56:35.544]  The point is, and I've already mentioned this, any experts could confirm this, both ours and Western ones.
[00:56:36.865 --> 00:56:45.236]  That the Ukrainian army is not capable of launching strikes with modern, high-precision, long-range, Western-made systems.
[00:56:45.617 --> 00:56:53.106]  This is only possible with the use of a proprietary system, which Ukraine does not have.
[00:56:55.167 --> 00:57:03.092]  This information comes only from European Union or United States satellites, essentially NATO satellites.
[00:57:03.873 --> 00:57:04.973]  That is the first thing.
[00:57:05.514 --> 00:57:16.301]  And very importantly, maybe the key thing, is that flight missions on these rocket systems can basically only be programmed by military personnel from NATO countries.
[00:57:18.683 --> 00:57:21.045]  Ukrainian servicemen are not able to do this.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:34.848]  That's why it's not about allowing the Ukrainian regime to strike Russia with these weapons or not allowing it.
[00:57:35.048 --> 00:57:41.173]  It's about deciding whether NATO countries directly participate in the military conflict or not.
[00:57:43.182 --> 00:57:54.251]  If this decision is made, it will mean nothing less than the direct involvement of NATO countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine.
[00:57:56.643 --> 00:58:01.744]  This is their direct involvement, and it significantly changes the nature of the conflict.
[00:58:04.886 --> 00:58:12.849]  It would mean that NATO countries, the USA, and European countries are at war with Russia.
[00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:24.113]  And if so, given the change in the nature of the conflict, we will make the corresponding decisions based on the threats posed to us.
[00:58:26.377 --> 00:58:28.800]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:04.542]  Alright, we are now into hour number two.
[00:59:07.163 --> 00:59:08.184]  We have a new video coming up.
[00:59:08.204 --> 00:59:08.985]  They're grabbing right now.
[00:59:09.025 --> 00:59:09.705]  This just broke.
[00:59:09.765 --> 00:59:10.786]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:59:10.806 --> 00:59:11.586]  It was just handed to me.
[00:59:12.507 --> 00:59:14.028]  This is such incendiary rhetoric.
[00:59:14.228 --> 00:59:17.531]  This is exactly what Dwayne Johnson the Rock came out last week and said he needs to stop.
[00:59:18.651 --> 00:59:21.453]  MSNBC on second assassination attempt.
[00:59:21.513 --> 00:59:22.714]  Trump had it coming.
[00:59:25.016 --> 00:59:26.537]  The video's on Infowars.com.
[00:59:27.117 --> 00:59:28.118]  We'll play that coming up.
[00:59:29.088 --> 00:59:31.050]  These guys are very open about what they're doing.
[00:59:31.090 --> 00:59:33.932]  They tried to kill him two months and two days ago in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[00:59:34.713 --> 00:59:35.434]  They had a stand-down.
[00:59:35.474 --> 00:59:36.254]  They lied to Congress.
[00:59:36.274 --> 00:59:37.035]  They did a cover-up.
[00:59:37.075 --> 00:59:37.796]  It's all confirmed.
[00:59:38.676 --> 00:59:39.697]  Even the Senate admits it.
[00:59:40.478 --> 00:59:45.882]  And now this guy knew right where to go, around a giant golf course, and pop out perfectly where Trump was and try to kill him.
[00:59:46.523 --> 00:59:47.824]  The Secret Service pinned him down.
[00:59:47.864 --> 00:59:48.445]  He ran off.
[00:59:48.465 --> 00:59:48.985]  They caught him.
[00:59:50.827 --> 00:59:53.389]  And as I said at the start of the show, and as Eric Brent said later,
[00:59:55.486 --> 00:59:56.066]  It's a no-brainer.
[00:59:56.726 --> 01:00:06.629]  You can't have the DHS with Mayorkas and the Secret Service to the investigation, the leadership of Pure Evil, definitely behind Butler, probably behind this, and the same thing with the Justice Department and the FBI.
[01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:10.750]  You cannot have them do the investigation.
[01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:17.232]  All right, there's a bunch of clubs I want to get to just to get them on record.
[01:00:17.472 --> 01:00:22.574]  Here's one from the press conference where they ask, well, why wasn't there Secret Service out there on the road?
[01:00:23.456 --> 01:00:24.477]  They're like, well, he doesn't have enough.
[01:00:24.517 --> 01:00:25.297]  He's not the president.
[01:00:26.118 --> 01:00:30.780]  It all goes for the puppet president and for Kamala and all the rest of it.
[01:00:31.341 --> 01:00:36.184]  That's my point is Trump doesn't have adequate security, even with a regular giant secret service detail.
[01:00:37.084 --> 01:00:41.147]  With all these continued assassination attempts and the rest of it, he should not be doing this.
[01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:49.033]  Or he should randomly pick a golf course he's going to be at and not tell anybody till the morning of.
[01:00:49.053 --> 01:00:55.776]  He's got his own jet and he can fly two hours in one of his golf courses or somebody else's and then he's safe because they don't have time to line this up.
[01:00:58.578 --> 01:01:01.139]  But he cannot just, oh, I'm at Mar-a-Lago for four days.
[01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:04.400]  I'm going to go play golf and then not think that somebody is coming to kill him.
[01:01:07.782 --> 01:01:09.883]  So here's something very important.
[01:01:11.391 --> 01:01:20.734]  This happened about three plus hours ago, about three hours and 10 minutes ago in Palm Beach at the big golf course right next to the Owens in Mar-a-Lago.
[01:01:24.155 --> 01:01:30.557]  Within minutes, the entire corporate press ran, it was just gang related, he's fine, it wasn't directed at him, everything's fine.
[01:01:31.117 --> 01:01:31.978]  That was their cover story.
[01:01:32.398 --> 01:01:34.739]  It was definitely told to them, we need to find out by who.
[01:01:35.919 --> 01:01:38.660]  Scripted, just like the cover up at Butler and all the rest of that happened.
[01:01:40.219 --> 01:01:43.101]  And Google, you know, for months saying it didn't happen.
[01:01:43.141 --> 01:01:47.463]  And that's why ChatGPT is separate from Google.
[01:01:47.483 --> 01:01:50.825]  But it said it didn't happen when I interviewed it two weeks ago, because Google says it didn't happen.
[01:01:51.465 --> 01:01:52.526]  That's information management.
[01:01:52.566 --> 01:01:53.206]  That's propaganda.
[01:01:53.226 --> 01:01:53.887]  That's brainwashing.
[01:01:54.367 --> 01:01:55.668]  That's 1984 on steroids.
[01:01:57.089 --> 01:02:00.471]  So they had that official story out.
[01:02:02.712 --> 01:02:02.852]  And
[01:02:05.387 --> 01:02:06.547]  That tells you everything you know.
[01:02:07.068 --> 01:02:08.748]  Just like Butler, they said, oh, he didn't get shot at.
[01:02:08.788 --> 01:02:09.368]  That's not true.
[01:02:09.388 --> 01:02:13.370]  For eight hours, Forbes, CNN, New York Times, he just fell down.
[01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:20.452]  So this is really, really, really, really bad.
[01:02:22.433 --> 01:02:26.614]  And it's in Trump's hands.
[01:02:28.174 --> 01:02:29.495]  He won't look like a scaredy cat.
[01:02:32.134 --> 01:02:32.674]  We're good to go.
[01:02:52.108 --> 01:02:58.175]  They've only got so many dead people, it's around 10% they can steal if they apply it all, if it's done right.
[01:02:58.195 --> 01:03:06.486]  6-7% if they don't get it applied right and fraud by, you know, closing the voting places and stuffing the ballots and putting them in the machines over and over again.
[01:03:07.773 --> 01:03:15.955]  That's why in all the places where Trump was winning when the polls closed and they go in and stuff in just enough for him to win, probably lost these states between six and 15,000 votes.
[01:03:16.335 --> 01:03:17.975]  They just got enough to get over the top.
[01:03:18.455 --> 01:03:19.795]  You got the graph where it's organic.
[01:03:20.155 --> 01:03:20.916]  He's above Biden.
[01:03:21.436 --> 01:03:23.176]  They close the polls, kick everybody out.
[01:03:23.236 --> 01:03:27.557]  They go in and start stuffing and then Biden goes up above just enough to get on top.
[01:03:28.477 --> 01:03:29.897]  That F curve it shows.
[01:03:33.338 --> 01:03:37.359]  So they know he's going to win.
[01:03:40.523 --> 01:03:43.645]  I mean, you got all these Hollywood people coming out for him now because they know where the support is.
[01:03:44.246 --> 01:03:45.446]  Got Elon Musk supporting him.
[01:03:48.148 --> 01:03:51.050]  And so, that's where we are.
[01:03:54.012 --> 01:03:57.254]  And it's his to lose by getting killed.
[01:03:57.274 --> 01:04:03.078]  They don't have to believe the crap about, oh, she's really ahead and all this ridiculousness.
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:07.642]  That's just them trying to convince you if they're able to steal it that she actually won.
[01:04:08.635 --> 01:04:10.976]  He's 25 points ahead of the general election.
[01:04:11.597 --> 01:04:12.717]  Battleground's 15.
[01:04:13.398 --> 01:04:16.199]  They don't have the numbers to steal it.
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:17.820]  It's too big to rig.
[01:04:18.141 --> 01:04:21.062]  That's why they're going to try to kill him.
[01:04:21.843 --> 01:04:23.204]  This is not even 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:04:23.524 --> 01:04:24.644]  It's not even 1 plus 1 equals 2.
[01:04:24.885 --> 01:04:27.846]  It's like, you look at the number 1 and say it's number 1.
[01:04:27.926 --> 01:04:31.969]  I mean, it's... You look at the Atlantic Ocean, and you go, that's the Atlantic Ocean.
[01:04:32.089 --> 01:04:33.790]  Or you look at the moon at night, that's the moon.
[01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:34.991]  You look at the sun, that's the sun.
[01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:36.371]  Look at my shirt.
[01:04:36.391 --> 01:04:37.412]  You go, that's a black shirt.
[01:04:37.572 --> 01:04:38.472]  Trump's tie is red.
[01:04:40.433 --> 01:04:43.295]  So, you know, I mean, this is this is a fact.
[01:04:46.696 --> 01:04:55.000]  But they still gaslight us, the corporate media with almost no viewers, but we still listen to them like they're still the authority, like they're still in charge, like they're still what they say matters.
[01:04:57.141 --> 01:05:04.445]  So what do we do about getting Trump to realize how much serious danger he's in and doing something about it?
[01:05:06.823 --> 01:05:07.363]  What do we do?
[01:05:12.007 --> 01:05:14.448]  So let's start out with a short clip from the press conference.
[01:05:14.468 --> 01:05:23.034]  I'm going to play the Hannity clip, which was accurate, which came out first and the media ignored him and didn't report on the guy that had just talked to the president and his friends that were there.
[01:05:23.074 --> 01:05:24.095]  He was supposed to play golf today.
[01:05:24.715 --> 01:05:25.376]  He's there all the time.
[01:05:27.117 --> 01:05:28.098]  Him and Trump are bosom buddies.
[01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:32.521]  And then I've got the CNN clips.
[01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:40.641]  Where they finally had to report the truth, just for new listeners, because there's a bunch of corporate media still saying it was gang-related, and we're just making this up.
[01:05:43.062 --> 01:05:44.523]  So, just play them back-to-back.
[01:05:46.225 --> 01:05:51.388]  Play the short press conference clip, then play Hannity, and then I'll get to these other clips of CNN admitting it was an attempt at assassination.
[01:05:51.408 --> 01:05:51.748]  Here it is.
[01:05:53.789 --> 01:05:57.432]  How was this able to happen, and for future reference, is there any opportunity of a golf course?
[01:05:58.459 --> 01:06:01.461]  Well, you got to understand the golf course is surrounded by shrubbery.
[01:06:01.501 --> 01:06:04.723]  So, when somebody gets into the shrubbery, they're pretty much out of sight.
[01:06:04.743 --> 01:06:05.844]  All right?
[01:06:06.324 --> 01:06:10.207]  And at this level that he is at right now, he's not the city president.
[01:06:10.828 --> 01:06:13.369]  If he was, we would have had this entire golf course around him.
[01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:19.754]  Well, because he's not, the security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible.
[01:06:20.834 --> 01:06:27.159]  So, I would imagine the next time he comes at a golf course, there'll probably be a little bit more people around the perimeter.
[01:06:28.103 --> 01:06:44.773]  Anyway, so long story short is President Trump, they were on the fifth hole, they were about to go up to putt, and the way Steve Whitkoff, now just as a little bit of background, Arthel, I happened to go to breakfast with Steve Whitkoff and another friend of mine this morning.
[01:06:45.454 --> 01:06:47.335]  And I was invited to play golf.
[01:06:47.735 --> 01:06:49.256]  They happen to be really good golfers.
[01:06:49.876 --> 01:06:57.061]  I don't have a lot of time to play golf, so I said thank you, but I'm not gonna go out on the golf course and get killed out there.
[01:06:57.641 --> 01:07:01.744]  But long story short, so they were playing, they were on the fifth hole.
[01:07:01.884 --> 01:07:11.031]  And the way Steve described this, the way the president described it, they both had exactly the same story, which was that they heard pop, pop, pop, pop.
[01:07:11.891 --> 01:07:16.695]  And Steve went into great specificity and great detail as to what happened right after.
[01:07:17.375 --> 01:07:23.157]  Within seconds, the Secret Service pounced on the President, covered him.
[01:07:23.698 --> 01:07:25.778]  You had snipers with tripods.
[01:07:25.999 --> 01:07:34.002]  They knew the direction where the shots had been fired, and they had eyes on the location where the shots had been fired.
[01:07:34.882 --> 01:07:36.643]  And long story short,
[01:07:38.404 --> 01:07:44.408]  I have confirmed with both the President and with Mr. Wyckoff that the gun has been found.
[01:07:44.828 --> 01:07:47.030]  They identified it as an AK-47.
[01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:59.839]  And thanks to Secret Service drone video coverage, they were able to identify one individual involved in this shooting getting into a car after dropping the AK-47.
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:09.166]  My understanding, according to both of them, is that that car has been identified and I believe it's been surrounded.
[01:08:09.566 --> 01:08:13.189]  Whether or not that person has been apprehended or not, I don't know.
[01:08:13.209 --> 01:08:16.051]  This happened in a matter of seconds.
[01:08:16.332 --> 01:08:27.481]  A little more color, a little bit more details on this, is that when they got on top of the President, immediately what is called a fast cart that I believe has steel reinforcement,
[01:08:27.921 --> 01:08:29.262]  We're good to go.
[01:08:53.312 --> 01:08:55.914]  Uh, so we don't have any details on any of that.
[01:08:56.014 --> 01:08:57.175]  They don't know that part.
[01:08:57.275 --> 01:09:03.640]  I only know the part of what they experienced while they were playing golf at Trump, uh, International in West Palm.
[01:09:04.061 --> 01:09:05.762]  Thankfully, the president is safe.
[01:09:06.403 --> 01:09:07.804]  Uh, Steve Whitkoff is safe.
[01:09:08.164 --> 01:09:19.293]  The Secret Service apparently acted with incredible speed and professionalism and, um, but, but certainly alarming in every way imaginable in light of what happened in Butler, as you mentioned.
[01:09:19.918 --> 01:09:20.419]  Yeah, of course.
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:21.522]  This is very alarming.
[01:09:21.602 --> 01:09:24.590]  And, Sean, have you spoken to the former president or texted with him?
[01:09:26.043 --> 01:09:31.966]  I have spoken with the president three times since this incident, and each time I got a new piece of information.
[01:09:32.526 --> 01:09:35.208]  One, that they had found, first of all, what happened with the shooting.
[01:09:35.588 --> 01:09:38.089]  The second thing, that they had found that AK-47.
[01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:50.715]  Third, that their drone footage was able to give them enough surveillance to identify the exact car that the individual involved in the shooting got into.
[01:09:51.355 --> 01:09:53.977]  And further detail that they gave me was that
[01:09:54.697 --> 01:10:01.083]  That they were updated and told that that car had been found, identified, was surrounded by law enforcement.
[01:10:01.183 --> 01:10:02.724]  I don't know what happened from there.
[01:10:03.145 --> 01:10:04.986]  It could not have been too far away.
[01:10:05.006 --> 01:10:12.974]  I would say the time frame was less than a half hour between the time that the shooting actually took place and they identified the car.
[01:10:13.074 --> 01:10:16.277]  So, on all fronts... I'm trying to find out, like, how is he doing?
[01:10:16.397 --> 01:10:17.177]  That's what we want to know.
[01:10:17.217 --> 01:10:18.879]  How is he doing if you spoke to him?
[01:10:19.059 --> 01:10:22.242]  You know, well, you really want to know the truth, Arthel?
[01:10:22.663 --> 01:10:28.549]  He goes, I really... Well, there's more details, because I did hear, and Steve Witkoff was very clear.
[01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:35.076]  The first thing the president did when he got back to the clubhouse was make sure that everybody else was okay.
[01:10:35.116 --> 01:10:37.118]  He didn't see his golf partner with him.
[01:10:37.318 --> 01:10:38.059]  Where's Steve?
[01:10:38.119 --> 01:10:38.760]  Where's Steve?
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.441]  Where's Steve?
[01:10:39.881 --> 01:10:41.162]  And then Steve says, I'm right here.
[01:10:41.622 --> 01:10:43.804]  He got in maybe a few minutes behind the president.
[01:10:44.144 --> 01:10:46.706]  The Secret Service was able to get everybody to safety.
[01:10:46.866 --> 01:10:48.868]  Everybody else was taken off the golf course.
[01:10:49.949 --> 01:11:04.839]  Then when the president found out everybody was safe and nobody had been harmed, I guess in typical fight, fight, fight fashion, Trump said to Steve, and then he related to me, I really wanted to finish the hole.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.742]  I was even and I had a birdie putt.
[01:11:09.323 --> 01:11:17.408]  And it was on the fifth hole, which shows a lot of, I think, guts and gumption and very Trumpian, I guess, in every way.
[01:11:17.468 --> 01:11:30.175]  But, you know, the good news we can report is that in spite of this being in such close proximity to the president and others and the Secret Service, that they were not harmed and that they are in safety.
[01:11:30.195 --> 01:11:32.957]  And I know the investigation will go forward.
[01:11:33.197 --> 01:11:35.979]  Probably more details, I would imagine, as time unfolds.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:38.901]  Alright, so.
[01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:42.664]  It's almost like a sport now.
[01:11:42.704 --> 01:11:44.005]  Yeah, they tried to kill him again.
[01:11:44.085 --> 01:11:44.946]  Well, he's tough.
[01:11:45.046 --> 01:11:46.787]  He'll put himself out there to get shot at again.
[01:11:49.289 --> 01:11:50.770]  It's gonna be real funny when they kill him.
[01:11:52.251 --> 01:11:52.531]  Not.
[01:11:57.095 --> 01:12:00.877]  Eric Trump came out and said, Leningradian has the quote, my father's running out of lives.
[01:12:01.478 --> 01:12:04.060]  Family and leaders shocked by Trump shooting.
[01:12:08.092 --> 01:12:11.874]  My father's running out of lives, said son Eric Trump on Fox News' Sarah Sean Hannity.
[01:12:12.374 --> 01:12:17.217]  How many more rifles are going to come within assassination distance of my father?
[01:12:23.441 --> 01:12:27.563]  And then I've got video like this will play.
[01:12:29.204 --> 01:12:31.005]  MSNBC on second assassination of Trump.
[01:12:32.506 --> 01:12:34.607]  MSNBC on second assassination attempt.
[01:12:35.007 --> 01:12:36.028]  Trump had it coming.
[01:12:39.602 --> 01:12:40.422]  These people, man.
[01:12:42.003 --> 01:12:43.004]  They're literally out to get us.
[01:12:43.024 --> 01:12:44.845]  They want to cut our son's penises off.
[01:12:45.245 --> 01:12:49.527]  And they brainwash them in public schools from Texas to New York, from Colorado to California.
[01:12:49.547 --> 01:12:52.589]  You think you're in a red state, but your cities are blue in most cases.
[01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:59.993]  And they put you in a database and keep it secret from the parents that they're getting them on the fast track to have their genitals cut off or be chemically castrated.
[01:13:00.053 --> 01:13:01.694]  And they're doing the same thing to little girls.
[01:13:01.734 --> 01:13:07.177]  I mean, what a sick group of evil freaks trying to give us poison shots, killing 35 million people.
[01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:12.299]  I mean, these are bad people and their minions just full of venom.
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:18.402]  Now I've made this prediction a thousand times as they tried to kill Trump and a thousand before that.
[01:13:19.002 --> 01:13:24.465]  They just found the first one they found it's from about poison or mass shootings or bombings or shooting his plane down.
[01:13:24.485 --> 01:13:25.526]  I always say the same thing.
[01:13:25.866 --> 01:13:29.668]  It's almost pointless to even play where I predicted this is going to happen because I've said it every show.
[01:13:30.708 --> 01:13:35.551]  Pretty much before they tried to kill him in Butler and Graves Demon now this, but
[01:13:39.076 --> 01:13:50.619]  This, uh, game of Russian roulette that Trump's playing, because the Cruz, I mean, I'm glad they found me predicting it, but they need to find where I predict he shouldn't be on that golf course.
[01:13:51.159 --> 01:14:01.841]  Mar-a-Lago's the main target to either truck bomb, because they let trucks get up close, you just drive through the barricades, or shoot him on the golf course.
[01:14:02.422 --> 01:14:04.942]  And I've said he needs to stop announcing where he's going to be.
[01:14:05.382 --> 01:14:07.763]  If he's going to play golf, he needs to randomly pick where it is.
[01:14:08.732 --> 01:14:10.833]  He's got so many damn golf courses and then just show up.
[01:14:10.873 --> 01:14:16.035]  Don't give him time to direct this guy who knew right where to come at the side of the golf course and pop out of the woods.
[01:14:16.055 --> 01:14:18.956]  He pulls up, gets out with a gun, guy sees him, runs into the woods.
[01:14:19.957 --> 01:14:21.397]  You hear pop, pop, pop, pop, pow.
[01:14:21.437 --> 01:14:22.698]  He runs away from the Secret Service.
[01:14:22.978 --> 01:14:24.438]  Secret Service, police pull up.
[01:14:24.458 --> 01:14:25.499]  They go, that's him, that's him.
[01:14:25.519 --> 01:14:26.339]  I mean, it was right there.
[01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:29.120]  They were on their job, but it's a huge perimeter.
[01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:32.141]  The average cop, Secret Service aren't bad.
[01:14:32.161 --> 01:14:32.982]  They're trying to do their job.
[01:14:35.009 --> 01:14:39.911]  But the guy literally just popped in and popped out, like magically finds right where Trump is.
[01:14:40.051 --> 01:14:40.291]  What?
[01:14:42.252 --> 01:14:46.093]  And during the breaks, I've checked X. I've checked other places.
[01:14:46.213 --> 01:14:48.714]  No one's asking why the guy knew right where to pop out.
[01:14:50.054 --> 01:14:56.437]  It'd be like if you were hunting a big buck on, shoot a big golf course like that.
[01:14:58.516 --> 01:15:00.017]  Look up how many acres Mar-a-Lago is.
[01:15:00.357 --> 01:15:03.639]  Look up how many acres Mar-a-Lago golf course is.
[01:15:03.659 --> 01:15:07.442]  It's got another name, but it's... How big is Trump's golf course in Mar-a-Lago?
[01:15:07.702 --> 01:15:10.323]  How many acres is Trump's golf course in Mar-a-Lago?
[01:15:11.584 --> 01:15:11.804]  What, 400, 500, 600?
[01:15:12.485 --> 01:15:15.266]  Probably a thousand?
[01:15:15.326 --> 01:15:15.767]  I don't know.
[01:15:18.388 --> 01:15:21.490]  And so a guy, imagine you're hunting a buck and there's woods all over the place.
[01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:22.151]  It's heavily wooded.
[01:15:23.007 --> 01:15:29.330]  I'd say half the golf course is woods, and there's roads around it, and he knows right where to pop up, right where the buck is, right on the hole he wants.
[01:15:29.410 --> 01:15:30.290]  Come on, people!
[01:15:31.571 --> 01:15:37.953]  You're hunting on 500 acres, and there's one buck, and you just pull your car up and just get out, and the buck's right where you come out.
[01:15:38.293 --> 01:15:40.014]  Come on, people!
[01:15:41.715 --> 01:15:46.377]  That's why folks tune into this show, because I come up with the angles other people don't, and I don't want to be the one coming up with the angles.
[01:15:46.457 --> 01:15:47.317]  It's so frustrating.
[01:15:52.247 --> 01:15:59.713]  I mean, that's what the Secret Service and the local police should be asking, and then the FBI, is how the hell did this guy know right where to pop up?
[01:16:06.679 --> 01:16:10.722]  Okay, well, it's 7,326 yards of play space.
[01:16:11.963 --> 01:16:12.524]  Look up this.
[01:16:13.024 --> 01:16:17.107]  How many square miles is the West Palm Beach Golf Club?
[01:16:17.768 --> 01:16:18.589]  That's what I want to know.
[01:16:18.669 --> 01:16:21.091]  When I said 500 acres, it's going to be thousands.
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:23.820]  Let me make a guess.
[01:16:25.561 --> 01:16:28.442]  It's a very expensive area, so I bet it's smaller than that.
[01:16:28.462 --> 01:16:29.643]  I bet it's a thousand acres.
[01:16:31.084 --> 01:16:31.964]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:16:32.304 --> 01:16:33.365]  The point is it's big.
[01:16:35.145 --> 01:16:39.347]  And if you think that guy just parked his car, went through woods, you can't even see the golf course there.
[01:16:39.787 --> 01:16:40.748]  It's designed like that.
[01:16:42.629 --> 01:16:47.351]  And then pops out and just perfectly is about to kill Trump, you need to have your head examined.
[01:16:50.583 --> 01:16:52.204]  I'm so angry I can barely do the show right now.
[01:16:52.224 --> 01:16:53.084]  I don't want to start cussing.
[01:16:54.545 --> 01:16:56.666]  But I know what it's going to be like if they kill Trump.
[01:16:56.766 --> 01:16:58.627]  I mean, you know, my ass is on the line.
[01:16:58.687 --> 01:17:00.128]  So is yours, but mine a lot faster.
[01:17:00.728 --> 01:17:03.150]  I mean, our lives are in the fucking balance here.
[01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:04.450]  God fucking damn it!
[01:17:05.151 --> 01:17:06.412]  See, I'm not taking the Lord's name in vain.
[01:17:06.432 --> 01:17:07.272]  I don't mean to disrespect.
[01:17:08.813 --> 01:17:09.333]  I apologize.
[01:17:09.353 --> 01:17:10.013]  I'm going to stop right now.
[01:17:10.554 --> 01:17:11.734]  I want God to damn these people.
[01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:12.095]  I mean that.
[01:17:12.115 --> 01:17:13.515]  I'm praying for God to damn these people to hell.
[01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:15.997]  I grew up Baptist.
[01:17:16.217 --> 01:17:17.618]  You never say that you're taking God's name in vain.
[01:17:17.638 --> 01:17:18.298]  No, I'm not taking it in vain.
[01:17:18.358 --> 01:17:18.678]  I mean it.
[01:17:19.018 --> 01:17:20.019]  I want God to damn these people.
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:22.220]  It doesn't matter.
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:23.561]  I'm not a preacher or a priest.
[01:17:23.581 --> 01:17:24.942]  So God knows my heart and you don't.
[01:17:25.923 --> 01:17:27.884]  And what comes out of my mouth comes out when I want to say it.
[01:17:28.084 --> 01:17:29.865]  I am beyond pissed off right now.
[01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:41.493]  It's only 200 acres.
[01:17:41.833 --> 01:17:44.035]  So I guess that it's still big.
[01:17:46.256 --> 01:17:47.277]  Oh, more than 200 acres.
[01:17:47.397 --> 01:17:48.598]  I don't think anybody knows.
[01:17:48.618 --> 01:17:49.498]  All right, that's enough.
[01:17:50.759 --> 01:17:51.440]  Okay, so
[01:17:53.919 --> 01:17:56.281]  There's a lot of angles, a lot to cover, a lot to do.
[01:17:56.341 --> 01:17:58.203]  Jack Posobiec said he'd be popping in anytime now.
[01:17:58.863 --> 01:18:00.945]  He was with his family at a carnival.
[01:18:02.586 --> 01:18:06.049]  Jack's a hard-working guy during the week, but he likes to take off some on Sunday with his family, and I get it.
[01:18:06.910 --> 01:18:07.830]  He's driving back home.
[01:18:08.511 --> 01:18:09.712]  All the kids had to cut it short.
[01:18:11.093 --> 01:18:13.155]  I want to get his take on this, so he should be joining us.
[01:18:13.175 --> 01:18:14.135]  Let me see if he's texting me.
[01:18:17.959 --> 01:18:22.022]  Talked about an hour ago, and he said it took him about an hour to get home, so he should be on in about 10-15 minutes with us.
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:41.425]  We're also going to be joining, coming up in about 35 minutes, our spaces, and a bunch of big folks decided they were going to kill their spaces and just join ours on X. So we'll be taking those speakers.
[01:18:41.525 --> 01:18:43.425]  Nick Sordor, hopefully at Maroon, will fall on.
[01:18:43.445 --> 01:18:49.247]  We know we're going to get... We'll get Steve Bannon on, but he's in prison right now, and a bunch of other... Jack Posovic's coming on.
[01:18:50.648 --> 01:18:51.508]  That's all coming up.
[01:18:51.528 --> 01:18:53.889]  But I said it, so here's a few of my Trump predictions.
[01:18:55.626 --> 01:19:02.468]  The Deep State already tried to kill him and failed on July 13th of this year, just 40-something days ago.
[01:19:03.328 --> 01:19:11.831]  And two days after it happened, I came out and said, the Deep State is going to try again and they're going to try to frame Iran.
[01:19:13.551 --> 01:19:17.292]  Ladies and gentlemen, I told you that we're not in normal times.
[01:19:17.752 --> 01:19:19.893]  World War III, nuclear war is this close.
[01:19:20.970 --> 01:19:24.931]  They just fired five shots at Trump and hit him in the side of the head.
[01:19:25.732 --> 01:19:28.513]  And the media's like, big deal, he survived an assassination attempt.
[01:19:29.533 --> 01:19:31.154]  And now they've tried to kill him with a gun.
[01:19:32.034 --> 01:19:33.575]  They're going to try to poison him.
[01:19:33.915 --> 01:19:34.375]  So Trump
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.101]  Inside Circle, listen to me.
[01:19:38.141 --> 01:19:39.001]  And I know you've listened before.
[01:19:39.021 --> 01:19:40.222]  You've had the Secret Service call me.
[01:19:40.602 --> 01:19:41.502]  I've briefed them on stuff.
[01:19:42.182 --> 01:19:42.823]  Listen to me.
[01:19:42.883 --> 01:19:45.184]  They're going to try to poison him now.
[01:19:45.924 --> 01:19:47.004]  This blew up in their face.
[01:19:47.085 --> 01:19:47.605]  They failed.
[01:19:47.625 --> 01:19:48.825]  They fired five shots.
[01:19:49.165 --> 01:19:50.166]  They killed two people.
[01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:54.548]  This means the New World Order is going for broke.
[01:19:55.048 --> 01:19:57.349]  But definitely the globalists are scared right now.
[01:19:57.669 --> 01:20:00.150]  And in closing, don't you agree they're going to try to kill Trump even more now?
[01:20:01.374 --> 01:20:02.694]  Yeah, he's in the biggest threat.
[01:20:03.095 --> 01:20:11.918]  He needs more protection than he's ever had, because right now it's basically guaranteed, like you said, that he's going to win because more people are coming on board, so he needs to be protected maximum.
[01:20:11.978 --> 01:20:17.059]  All right, folks, we'll get Ivan Reikland, former Green Beret colonel, on as well coming up.
[01:20:17.099 --> 01:20:17.620]  He's texting.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:29.904]  He wants to get on, so we'll get Potobos coming up, Reikland, Nick Sartor, a lot of the really smart folks, and Chase will be in here co-hosting with me as well into the third and fourth hour tonight.
[01:20:31.246 --> 01:20:32.367]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:36.430]  Coming up, I've got MSNBC saying Trump had it coming.
[01:20:39.873 --> 01:20:40.213]  Wow.
[01:20:40.934 --> 01:20:43.236]  Also, other big breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[01:20:43.276 --> 01:20:51.823]  Biden and men defy subpoenas demanding answers surrounding executive order allowing agencies to promote voter registration of illegal aliens.
[01:20:52.483 --> 01:20:54.245]  That story's huge on InfoWars.com.
[01:20:54.265 --> 01:20:58.889]  That's totally illegal, what he's doing, but that's just par for the course.
[01:21:00.134 --> 01:21:03.377]  Uh, with these crooks, but by the grace of God, Trump's alive.
[01:21:04.258 --> 01:21:06.601]  That's twice now in two months and two days.
[01:21:07.742 --> 01:21:14.649]  And I, I guess, I mean, I guess Trump's just going to parade around in front of his enemies even more now.
[01:21:14.729 --> 01:21:15.750]  I would probably predict.
[01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:16.390]  Okay.
[01:21:17.091 --> 01:21:20.534]  We're just sitting here waiting for somebody to put a bullet in him.
[01:21:22.036 --> 01:21:22.596]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:22.636 --> 01:21:23.037]  Stay with us.
[01:21:26.809 --> 01:21:31.992]  Well, I'm on the air seven days a week during this election because it's the most important election in world history.
[01:21:32.032 --> 01:21:37.596]  The globals are trying to start World War III with Russia, announcing they're gonna start raining down storm shadow missiles inside Russia.
[01:21:37.636 --> 01:21:41.258]  Russia says that's an act of war and that they're gonna go to war with NATO.
[01:21:42.705 --> 01:21:44.667]  We got Jack Masoby calling in in 10 minutes.
[01:21:45.287 --> 01:21:48.210]  Ivan Reikland, former Green Beret colonel, lawyer, really smart guy.
[01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:48.850]  You know him well.
[01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:50.752]  On the front lines of understanding what's happening.
[01:21:50.772 --> 01:21:53.094]  Basically lives up on Capitol Hill going after the deep state.
[01:21:53.674 --> 01:21:57.317]  When Jack pops in, we'll put him on hold and come back to him if he wants to stay with us.
[01:21:57.357 --> 01:21:58.258]  He's got a lot to say.
[01:21:59.519 --> 01:22:02.581]  Also coming up, we've got MSNBC on second assassination attempt.
[01:22:02.641 --> 01:22:03.502]  Trump had it coming.
[01:22:04.763 --> 01:22:07.906]  Here's what I want to say to Ivan Reikland and get his observations.
[01:22:08.666 --> 01:22:11.309]  You've got this huge golf course
[01:22:12.745 --> 01:22:15.912]  And you've got 18 holes and you've got woods all the way around it.
[01:22:16.393 --> 01:22:19.139]  And this guy drops in an SUV in an area highly patrolled.
[01:22:20.865 --> 01:22:22.046]  By police and Secret Service.
[01:22:22.086 --> 01:22:25.848]  They were there 30 seconds after he got shot at by Secret Service.
[01:22:25.868 --> 01:22:28.209]  Reportedly, he may have shot first, but missed.
[01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:31.591]  We're not sure yet, but they admit that they saw him with a gun and there was gunfire.
[01:22:31.811 --> 01:22:32.292]  One went off.
[01:22:32.872 --> 01:22:35.273]  Probably both sides were not sure, but Secret Service definitely shot at him.
[01:22:35.814 --> 01:22:42.057]  The person that saw him saw him go in with a gun, saw him run off with a gun, pointed him out as he ran for the police, so they got him.
[01:22:42.237 --> 01:22:42.938]  He's in custody.
[01:22:43.658 --> 01:22:53.104]  How did he just drop in magically around this huge golf course with massive woods all around it so it doesn't disturb the neighborhood, and just know right where Trump would be, which he did on the fifth hole?
[01:22:53.504 --> 01:22:54.325]  I mean, come on!
[01:22:54.345 --> 01:23:01.109]  And then the media is absolutely ready with its, oh, it's just gunfire, it's gang-related, when they didn't get Trump.
[01:23:01.129 --> 01:23:05.392]  That was pushed out within minutes, even though Sean Hannity was supposed to go on the golf event.
[01:23:06.212 --> 01:23:09.213]  ...outing, called Trump and his friend and got the real story.
[01:23:09.253 --> 01:23:10.034]  That was out instantly.
[01:23:10.054 --> 01:23:10.874]  The media ignored that.
[01:23:11.434 --> 01:23:14.816]  But then, because local police got to the press, the truth came out.
[01:23:15.876 --> 01:23:17.577]  America is in a war for its future.
[01:23:19.318 --> 01:23:23.140]  America is in a war for its very survival right now.
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:24.520]  The deep state is cornered.
[01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:25.821]  They know Trump's going to win a landslide.
[01:23:25.861 --> 01:23:27.041]  They tried to kill him two months ago.
[01:23:27.081 --> 01:23:28.002]  They tried to kill again.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:30.760]  This country's fighting for its life.
[01:23:30.821 --> 01:23:32.701]  This is what it looks like right now.
[01:23:33.081 --> 01:23:38.363]  Ivan Reikland, give us your expert take just three hours into this unfolding on what you think's going on here.
[01:23:38.383 --> 01:23:44.146]  And do you agree with me that the guy dropping in, witness, pulls in, pulls right up, calmly walks in the woods with a gun.
[01:23:44.166 --> 01:23:47.447]  30 seconds later, there's shots going off.
[01:23:47.767 --> 01:23:50.548]  The guy walks back out, runs, gets in the car and drives off.
[01:23:50.648 --> 01:23:54.530]  I mean, how the hell would you drop in like that if you didn't have somebody directing you there?
[01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:57.431]  Or it's just one in a million luckiness, Ivan.
[01:23:58.519 --> 01:23:59.039]  I'm going to say this.
[01:23:59.079 --> 01:24:06.181]  I mean, it's not like the Secret Service are protecting a new target like what, you know, they could claim that, oh, Butler, Pennsylvania, that's something new.
[01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:07.181]  We did a little recon.
[01:24:07.221 --> 01:24:07.661]  We failed.
[01:24:08.101 --> 01:24:12.302]  This is a fixed site that they've had to protect for numerous years.
[01:24:12.662 --> 01:24:18.503]  So it's not like it's a new sort of plan of action that they need to take in order to protect the facility known as Mar-a-Lago.
[01:24:18.983 --> 01:24:25.765]  There's and the golf course that he owns, not only Mar-a-Lago, but the different golf courses that President Trump owns.
[01:24:26.226 --> 01:24:27.246]  So in this instance, right?
[01:24:27.727 --> 01:24:32.329]  And so it's very disingenuous to say that it is yet another mistake.
[01:24:32.369 --> 01:24:35.210]  Like Jack Dorsey says when he censors folks, it's a mistake.
[01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:36.810]  The Secret Service say it's a mistake.
[01:24:37.171 --> 01:24:41.052]  No, at this point in time, it needs to be presumed that it was an inside job.
[01:24:41.392 --> 01:24:44.594]  And then it needs to be disproven that it was an inside job.
[01:24:46.134 --> 01:24:46.454]  I agree.
[01:24:46.494 --> 01:24:47.615]  What are your other observations?
[01:24:49.224 --> 01:25:10.863]  Yeah, I think at this point we need to, all of our networks that are listening in, we need to go ahead and start to basically create a list of those Secret Service officers that were on site July 13th, that were on site today, and figure out if there's any overlap, and then also take a look at who is investigating the assassination attempts.
[01:25:11.283 --> 01:25:14.046]  I know that the Miami field office's special agent in charge
[01:25:14.366 --> 01:25:14.466]  Yeah.
[01:25:44.446 --> 01:25:53.931]  infused FBI is essentially using its authority at this point to go well above and beyond just their private citizen capacity First Amendment activity.
[01:25:54.391 --> 01:26:00.535]  It's going into their investigative work and probably beyond to nefarious bad faith activity.
[01:26:01.555 --> 01:26:12.241]  So let me look at every single one of them and start to expose them and the risk that they pose to a President Trump presidency.
[01:26:13.308 --> 01:26:22.012]  So Trump in two months and two days, so that's in 62 days, 63 days, has survived two assassination attempts.
[01:26:23.173 --> 01:26:27.515]  And you and I called this a year ago, almost, eight months ago, February, right?
[01:26:27.955 --> 01:26:32.458]  And everybody was yelling at us, oh, they're advocating for something bad.
[01:26:32.518 --> 01:26:34.959]  No, we're giving you what their playbook is going to be.
[01:26:34.999 --> 01:26:38.221]  And we hit it on the nail to the T. And they're only escalating.
[01:26:39.901 --> 01:26:41.982]  So this will only make them escalate more, won't it?
[01:26:42.022 --> 01:26:42.983]  They're a cornered animal.
[01:26:44.409 --> 01:26:44.830]  Absolutely.
[01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:49.455]  They are cornered and one of the reasons I think that they're doing this is
[01:26:50.562 --> 01:26:52.964]  I like that meme that you put out earlier on your ex account.
[01:26:53.384 --> 01:26:55.365]  Elon Musk just moved Twitter to Texas.
[01:26:55.846 --> 01:27:04.351]  There are now more opportunities to expose these scum through Twitter holdings in a safer manner now that Elon has those headquarters here in Texas.
[01:27:04.812 --> 01:27:09.575]  And I think that they're factoring this in and trying to do all things available to them.
[01:27:09.855 --> 01:27:11.476]  You mentioned it earlier on the program.
[01:27:11.776 --> 01:27:13.377]  I watched some of your material earlier today.
[01:27:13.858 --> 01:27:14.718]  They're going to go to war.
[01:27:15.039 --> 01:27:16.419]  They're going to go ahead and do cyber.
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:18.941]  They're just going to do all full court press.
[01:27:18.961 --> 01:27:20.102]  And that's why I think it is
[01:27:20.682 --> 01:27:21.623]  Well, I can tell you without giving any...
[01:27:44.506 --> 01:27:46.827]  And we're going to check back in with you a little bit later.
[01:27:47.447 --> 01:27:47.787]  Jack, what's up?
[01:27:47.807 --> 01:27:48.127]  It's coming up.
[01:27:48.188 --> 01:27:53.370]  I want to interview you more on some other subjects that are tied into this, but let's just say it.
[01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:57.771]  Trump needs to, because he doesn't have the security, he doesn't have the full secret service.
[01:27:57.791 --> 01:28:02.013]  They admitted that in the press conference, that that's why there weren't any secret service, you know, in the woods or on that road.
[01:28:02.053 --> 01:28:02.993]  This is preposterous.
[01:28:03.634 --> 01:28:08.175]  Trump has got to stop parading around in all these target zones.
[01:28:08.375 --> 01:28:09.056]  It's got to stop.
[01:28:10.996 --> 01:28:12.257]  I see your argument on that.
[01:28:13.926 --> 01:28:14.126]  It is.
[01:28:32.521 --> 01:28:37.403]  If he wants to go to one of his golf courses, get on a plane, not tell anybody and go there, he'll be okay.
[01:28:37.843 --> 01:28:40.224]  Clearly this guy had help and was directed right to that spot.
[01:28:40.664 --> 01:28:43.045]  He cannot go somewhere and stay somewhere four days.
[01:28:43.105 --> 01:28:45.206]  That gives them plenty of time to launch an operation.
[01:28:46.846 --> 01:28:59.891]  I think the most important thing that we collectively can do, and this is what I'm, the reason why I'm in Texas is to, the way we protect president Trump is that we have to make those people that have TDS have less of it.
[01:29:00.447 --> 01:29:07.771]  And the way we do that is to put out more and more content as you're doing, exposing the nefarious actors that are going after them.
[01:29:08.211 --> 01:29:12.614]  And if we can do it with granular level detail, then that puts them on defense.
[01:29:12.814 --> 01:29:14.174]  Then they have to defend themselves.
[01:29:14.515 --> 01:29:17.036]  Right now, they feel that they can act with impunity.
[01:29:17.616 --> 01:29:24.260]  We need to make sure that we are the blocking force in the psyche of the American people, and then also have
[01:29:24.699 --> 01:29:35.547]  Other layers of physical protection, as you mentioned, other than relying on federal actors that are clearly in the positions that they are in order to create increased risk to President Trump.
[01:29:35.848 --> 01:29:41.872]  So maybe, I can't remember who called on it, but I think Governor DeSantis should take the lead in this investigation.
[01:29:42.213 --> 01:29:43.514]  Florida needs to take the lead.
[01:29:44.374 --> 01:29:49.738]  The local and state officials need to take lead on the investigation of this assassination attempt.
[01:29:50.139 --> 01:29:51.620]  If they don't, then guess what?
[01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:59.243]  It will appear as though Ron DeSantis, as the governor of Florida, is complicit in the cover-up of this assassination attempt.
[01:29:59.263 --> 01:30:02.785]  What do you make of Eric Prince, who we know has been providing a lot of logistics?
[01:30:02.825 --> 01:30:05.426]  I think, yeah, I think Eric Prince is the one that called on it earlier today.
[01:30:06.266 --> 01:30:06.707]  Absolutely.
[01:30:06.747 --> 01:30:14.250]  I mean, we cannot have the same old Obama, New World Order, Biden-Harris machine be involved in this at any levels.
[01:30:16.051 --> 01:30:16.291]  Agreed.
[01:30:17.068 --> 01:30:29.536]  Eric Prince, as a private citizen, is the one that is most experienced in running a company that protects the highest level of importance individuals globally.
[01:30:30.116 --> 01:30:30.777]  And what do they do?
[01:30:30.837 --> 01:30:38.402]  They change routes all the time, they fly people in helicopters that are on the ground, and they drive 100 miles an hour and tell no one where they're going the minute they go.
[01:30:39.282 --> 01:30:46.347]  So the first thing he'll say is, stop going to a place we can't control or protect you and letting people know that you're on a damn golf course.
[01:30:48.137 --> 01:30:48.318]  Right.
[01:30:48.378 --> 01:30:51.706]  I mean, I would say take Eric Prince's lead on this.
[01:30:51.766 --> 01:30:52.467]  He's probably the most
[01:30:53.414 --> 01:31:07.058]  Well, speaking of Eric, Eric Trump says my dad's running out of lives, they're trying to kill him, the Secret Service won't protect him, we've got to do something.
[01:31:07.078 --> 01:31:11.360]  Yeah, your dad, I'm not attacking Trump, you know, we get it, he's not a coward.
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:19.342]  It's not cowardly, I'm not a coward, but if I was Trump and the top guy that they've got to take out and he's going to win in a landslide, I sure as hell would knock off the golf course stuff.
[01:31:22.967 --> 01:31:25.869]  Yeah, I mean, change your pattern of life.
[01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:30.913]  Make things a lot harder for them to put you in a position to be vulnerable.
[01:31:31.413 --> 01:31:32.394]  I would agree a hundred percent.
[01:31:32.414 --> 01:31:39.679]  All right, if you were talking to Trump, Ivan, and he listens to you, I know, and so does Capitol Hill, a lot of folks, what would you say, if you had two minutes to talk to Trump, what would you say to him?
[01:31:42.801 --> 01:31:44.462]  I would say, I would need 30 seconds.
[01:31:45.162 --> 01:31:48.705]  I would tell him to pick up the phone and then go ahead and call two people.
[01:31:49.344 --> 01:31:54.946]  General Flynn, Eric Prince, those two people need to be by your side every day at every single meeting that you're at.
[01:31:55.586 --> 01:31:55.826]  Done.
[01:31:58.387 --> 01:31:58.707]  All right.
[01:31:58.867 --> 01:32:05.830]  As this unfolds later tonight, tomorrow, Ivan Reikland, I want to talk to you again for radio listeners that didn't see your X handle up on screen.
[01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:06.510]  I'll be able to find you.
[01:32:08.111 --> 01:32:08.271]  Yeah.
[01:32:08.311 --> 01:32:14.633]  So Ivan Reikland, I'm on X primarily at this point in the digital battle space and then also on Rumble.
[01:32:15.334 --> 01:32:16.874]  And I am in Texas all week.
[01:32:16.914 --> 01:32:18.195]  I'm actually sitting here in Houston.
[01:32:18.215 --> 01:32:20.335]  I'm going to be doing some bigger shows, Dinesh.
[01:32:21.176 --> 01:32:23.276]  I'm going to be up at Blaze as well at the end of the week.
[01:32:23.796 --> 01:32:26.957]  And then in Infowar Studios with some of your colleagues there.
[01:32:27.357 --> 01:32:31.819]  If you want me to report within studios as well, I'd be honored to come on board on Wednesday.
[01:32:31.839 --> 01:32:32.279]  Absolutely.
[01:32:32.299 --> 01:32:34.419]  60 second closing point about what you witnessed today.
[01:32:34.439 --> 01:32:36.100]  I can't believe we're just... I'm doing it too.
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:38.580]  We're just calmly talking about a second assassination attempt.
[01:32:40.081 --> 01:32:44.322]  So Donald Trump presents at this point the gravest threat
[01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:49.653]  to the established order and the deep state domestically and globally.
[01:32:50.073 --> 01:32:54.036]  Everyone knows that now because you've been saying that for decades, right?
[01:32:54.416 --> 01:32:55.817]  Finally, it's coming to fruition.
[01:32:56.478 --> 01:33:05.583]  And with X, also the amplification platform, exposing this to a billion monthly active users almost, it is now at a critical juncture.
[01:33:05.944 --> 01:33:12.388]  We're in a digital, I'll just call it for what it is, it's a digital and information civil war.
[01:33:12.748 --> 01:33:13.969]  Let's keep it peaceful,
[01:33:14.625 --> 01:33:24.671]  By continuing to apply pressure and then usher in the existential threat to the deep state, usher in President Trump so that we can start to prosecute and hold all those individuals to account.
[01:33:24.831 --> 01:33:25.171]  That's right.
[01:33:25.231 --> 01:33:28.733]  We're peacefully winning the hearts and minds of the info war with soft power.
[01:33:28.933 --> 01:33:31.595]  The enemy's losing, so they're desperately trying violence.
[01:33:32.335 --> 01:33:35.377]  And that's why I'm really concerned about false flags being blamed on Trump supporters.
[01:33:35.417 --> 01:33:35.957]  Look for that.
[01:33:36.438 --> 01:33:37.738]  Ivan Reiglin, we'll talk to you again soon.
[01:33:38.619 --> 01:33:39.039]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:33:39.359 --> 01:33:39.820]  Appreciate you.
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:40.860]  All right.
[01:33:43.888 --> 01:33:46.292]  Let's go ahead and play the clip that I was talking about.
[01:33:46.312 --> 01:33:48.055]  The full clip's up on Infowars.com.
[01:33:48.817 --> 01:33:51.622]  MSNBC on second assassination attempt.
[01:33:52.323 --> 01:33:53.785]  Trump had it coming.
[01:33:53.986 --> 01:33:54.366]  Here it is.
[01:33:55.276 --> 01:33:57.416]  Yeah.
[01:33:58.057 --> 01:34:01.617]  Do you expect there to be calls from within the Trump campaign to do that?
[01:34:03.378 --> 01:34:09.359]  Because he's going to reach out to his supporters and say, let's take this down.
[01:34:10.099 --> 01:34:14.300]  We do not know, again, the source of any gunshot or gunshots.
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:16.800]  We don't know who's responsible for this.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.941]  The whole thing has yet to be 100% confirmed.
[01:34:20.841 --> 01:34:22.882]  From start to finish, how this all played out.
[01:34:23.422 --> 01:34:30.025]  But do you expect to hear anything from the Trump campaign about toning down the rhetoric, toning down the violence?
[01:34:30.085 --> 01:34:33.326]  Or would that be atypical of the former president?
[01:34:34.086 --> 01:34:41.249]  Well, Alex, remember back to the assassination attempt on President Trump's life and how, you know, there was talk of a new tone.
[01:34:41.309 --> 01:34:45.951]  And then the Republican convention was, by Trumpian standards, muted.
[01:34:46.191 --> 01:34:49.072]  And it did seem like he was, you know,
[01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.470]  Just
[01:35:08.530 --> 01:35:09.431]  These people are sick.
[01:35:28.737 --> 01:35:44.004]  All right, we're going to be joining Jack Posobiec here in a minute when he calls in to give us his take, and then we're going to be connecting with Nick Sordor and a bunch of others simulcasting on RX Spaces, a bunch of very informed speakers and folks giving their take on the situation we're witnessing.
[01:35:44.064 --> 01:35:46.866]  But we do have Jack Posobiec now connected.
[01:35:47.486 --> 01:35:58.731]  Again, he's former Naval Intelligence, but I've known him for eight, nine years, great journalist, so prolific, reaching over 10 million people a day conservatively, now with his popular news programs and more.
[01:35:59.551 --> 01:36:01.552]  And it's just, we knew this was coming.
[01:36:02.032 --> 01:36:03.013]  Trump's got a lot of courage.
[01:36:03.053 --> 01:36:04.633]  He still lives his life the way he wants to.
[01:36:04.673 --> 01:36:10.416]  But in this situation, I think he needs to really understand that until he's president, he won't have the security he needs to do things like this.
[01:36:11.096 --> 01:36:12.377]  God is protecting him, but
[01:36:13.337 --> 01:36:14.918]  You don't want to tempt fate as well.
[01:36:15.699 --> 01:36:18.080]  We've seen a lot of very interesting developments here.
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:22.223]  Them trying to deny it was an assassination attempt at first, then having to admit it.
[01:36:22.683 --> 01:36:24.444]  Some of the media saying Trump had it coming to him.
[01:36:24.504 --> 01:36:25.305]  MSNBC.
[01:36:26.105 --> 01:36:28.947]  This is just wild with the whole Russia development.
[01:36:29.287 --> 01:36:30.208]  Jack was on Friday.
[01:36:31.383 --> 01:36:42.033]  That show on X, because Musk has taken the controls off, it's clear, we had 40 plus million views on my show and the other shows combined.
[01:36:42.313 --> 01:36:43.054]  Just amazing.
[01:36:43.074 --> 01:36:44.335]  So people are getting the word.
[01:36:44.796 --> 01:36:49.721]  We're obviously talking about the storm shadow missiles and that that's confirmed now that Biden has green lit that reportedly.
[01:36:50.101 --> 01:36:51.182]  Russia says that's an act of war.
[01:36:51.222 --> 01:36:55.006]  So we have these twin things going on, but clearly the deep state needs to get rid of Trump.
[01:36:55.706 --> 01:36:59.915]  Ahead of launching what could turn into World War 3, but very quickly.
[01:36:59.935 --> 01:37:01.878]  So Jack, I believe we've got limited time here.
[01:37:01.918 --> 01:37:03.041]  We're 10 minutes to break.
[01:37:03.081 --> 01:37:03.882]  So you've got the floor.
[01:37:04.183 --> 01:37:04.984]  Give us your briefing, sir.
[01:37:06.892 --> 01:37:11.414]  Well Alex, thanks so much for having me on, and of course for doing this emergency broadcast.
[01:37:11.474 --> 01:37:14.076]  Look, I learned the news as much as everybody else.
[01:37:14.156 --> 01:37:27.402]  Probably just a few minutes before it went live, I was getting sources from the local Palm Beach County police, people who were down there hearing of the attack, hearing that something had gone on, a potential second assassination attempt.
[01:37:27.422 --> 01:37:32.465]  We also know that very early on, liberal media were trying to downplay this yet again,
[01:37:32.945 --> 01:37:37.907]  Trying to say this was a gang-related thing, trying to say it was two people in a high-crime area.
[01:37:38.287 --> 01:37:48.272]  No, this was a Trump assassination attempt, the second one we've seen in two months, almost two months exactly, to the day.
[01:37:48.912 --> 01:37:53.514]  And what we are now witnessing, and people know that I've got the book coming out about the first one.
[01:37:53.554 --> 01:37:56.535]  I've just got off the phone, by the way, with my publisher just a few minutes ago.
[01:37:56.935 --> 01:38:00.477]  Ryan Routh will be included in Bulletproof.
[01:38:00.797 --> 01:38:01.478]  We're good to go.
[01:38:21.957 --> 01:38:30.123]  From Afghanistan after that failed after the stand down of withdrawal and of Kabul to bring them to Ukraine to get involved in the fight there.
[01:38:30.463 --> 01:38:44.573]  This is someone who is clearly at the nexus of mercenaries clearly at the nexus of CIA operatives clearly at the nexus of so many various things that we've seen going on where foreign fighters have come from the United States.
[01:38:44.892 --> 01:38:45.432]  Go to Ukraine.
[01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:52.218]  By the way, this happened in Syria as well, where far leftists would go into Syria to receive training.
[01:38:52.258 --> 01:38:58.563]  They would go to the battlefield, they would receive training with terrorist groups, and then they would come back and conduct attacks in the United States.
[01:38:58.583 --> 01:39:00.985]  And we know that some of them were involved in CHAZ.
[01:39:01.205 --> 01:39:06.730]  So we're seeing yet another example of someone who's an ardent leftist who has traveled to Ukraine.
[01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:08.131]  He went crazy during COVID.
[01:39:08.311 --> 01:39:11.634]  He went even crazier during the Ukraine crisis.
[01:39:11.934 --> 01:39:12.274]  He has.
[01:39:26.465 --> 01:39:29.907]  Why didn't President Trump have full security, presidential level security?
[01:39:30.248 --> 01:39:32.549]  How did he have access to this?
[01:39:33.370 --> 01:39:37.232]  And more importantly, did he have access to President Trump's schedule?
[01:39:37.253 --> 01:39:47.059]  Because from what my people are telling me, that he was only about one or two holes away from where he was situated, was one or two holes away from where President Trump was standing.
[01:39:47.119 --> 01:39:54.224]  I'm also told that when he had his interaction, his exchange of fire, and I keep hearing that phrase over and over, exchange of fire.
[01:39:55.816 --> 01:39:55.956]  He
[01:40:16.288 --> 01:40:16.808]  We'll fix that.
[01:40:16.868 --> 01:40:17.409]  Go ahead, Jack.
[01:40:17.449 --> 01:40:18.490]  Can you hear me now, Jack?
[01:40:41.087 --> 01:40:42.047]  Yeah, you know, I can hear you.
[01:40:42.087 --> 01:40:43.188]  I just hear all the producers as well.
[01:40:43.388 --> 01:40:43.968]  Yeah, of course.
[01:40:44.008 --> 01:40:44.749]  They got a microphone open.
[01:40:46.530 --> 01:40:47.970]  Listen, my issue is this.
[01:40:48.691 --> 01:40:49.231]  Start over.
[01:40:49.451 --> 01:40:53.253]  You're saying we now know the name of the reported shooter there in Florida.
[01:40:54.605 --> 01:41:05.928]  So the reported shooter, we're told, is Ryan Wesley Ralph, 58 years old, someone who is intimately involved in Ukraine recruiting operations for foreign fighters.
[01:41:05.988 --> 01:41:10.129]  So the foreign fighter flow that was going between the US and Ukraine.
[01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:14.370]  This is a guy who was directly involved with these types of operations.
[01:41:14.430 --> 01:41:24.052]  Someone, by the way, who was even quoted in the New York Times about about a year ago alongside Malcolm Nance, who was also involved in these foreign fighter flows.
[01:41:24.891 --> 01:41:24.992]  As
[01:41:41.209 --> 01:41:43.310]  They're saying he resided in Florida than other places.
[01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:45.912]  He's referring to himself as being from Hawaii.
[01:41:46.052 --> 01:41:48.253]  The New York Times said that he was from North Carolina.
[01:41:48.493 --> 01:41:55.057]  But again and again, the main nexus that we see coming up here is that he was heavily involved with Ukraine.
[01:41:55.957 --> 01:42:02.801]  If this is the exact name, by the way, he was involved with a scheme to attempt to recruit
[01:42:03.633 --> 01:42:19.549]  Afghan refugees, so Afghan foreign train fighters or USCIA train fighters that he was attempting to bring those Afghan fighters into Ukraine to fight Russia and was having trouble getting the passports in order to do so.
[01:42:20.429 --> 01:42:22.852]  Also we're seeing that he received
[01:42:23.536 --> 01:42:43.213]  Direct consent from the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine back in May of this year saying that he was under contract as Potentially a a mercenary or a what they call a salaried soldier Under the position of a shooter Rahim Kassam has that up.
[01:42:43.253 --> 01:42:44.114]  I've retweeted it.
[01:42:44.174 --> 01:42:45.835]  So Look guys.
[01:42:46.035 --> 01:42:50.299]  There's a lot coming out on him far more than ever came out on Thomas Matthew Crooks and
[01:42:51.238 --> 01:42:55.362]  And we just finished or I thought we had finished writing the book on Thomas Matthew Crooks.
[01:42:55.402 --> 01:43:01.187]  But of course, I've spoken to the publisher for Bulletproof and we are actually going to be pulling that from the presses.
[01:43:01.287 --> 01:43:07.934]  They say if we have time, we're able to we're able to get the information about Ryan Routh in there because this is the historic event.
[01:43:08.294 --> 01:43:09.175]  The name is out there.
[01:43:09.335 --> 01:43:11.917]  Ryan Routh is the name all over the place.
[01:43:11.937 --> 01:43:17.102]  The FBI has confirmed this is a second assassination attempt and we are seeing someone
[01:43:17.421 --> 01:43:23.289]  Who has far left-wing politics, but also extreme, neoconservative, neoliberal politics.
[01:43:23.590 --> 01:43:34.345]  Someone who, by the way, Alex, you and I have been saying again and again, that there would be something involving Ukraine, involving Russia, that would potentially affect our election directly, and it looks as though that may have just happened.
[01:43:36.159 --> 01:43:39.520]  Jack, pulling back here again, you've got it all up on your ex-account.
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:40.881]  We've reposted it as well.
[01:43:40.961 --> 01:43:44.762]  This has just broke the last 20 minutes that they have him in custody.
[01:43:44.802 --> 01:43:45.863]  They're now releasing his name.
[01:43:45.923 --> 01:43:54.926]  And I remember you a year ago, eight months ago, six months ago, two months ago, three months ago, saying we need to look at Ukrainians, Americans that have trained in Ukraine,
[01:43:55.626 --> 01:43:58.548]  Coming back to America, who've got training, who've been radicalized.
[01:43:58.808 --> 01:44:14.279]  It's like a lot of these white supremacists the Southern Poverty Law Center and others are controlling, posing as Trump supporters, turned out are U.S.-Ukraine or Canadian-Ukraine or European-Ukraine veterans coming back here, and you've warned that they could be connected to the previous assassination and future ones of Trump.
[01:44:14.299 --> 01:44:15.719]  Do you remember saying that?
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:19.942]  Because you were the only one I've ever heard say that, and now it's coming true.
[01:44:20.983 --> 01:44:22.284]  Well, Alex, it's happened before.
[01:44:22.364 --> 01:44:23.285]  It's happened before that
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:30.141]  We've seen radicals get military experience in Syria, come back and conduct domestic terror operations.
[01:44:30.181 --> 01:44:31.121]  This happened in Chaz.
[01:44:31.141 --> 01:44:37.162]  I'm one of the only people who's ever reported on this, with the YPG sending people over to Chaz.
[01:44:37.182 --> 01:44:49.744]  And we've seen it again, and potentially we've seen it again here, where someone who's clearly highly radicalized, who was involved in fighting in Ukraine, then came back to the United States, came back to Florida, and attempted to kill President Trump.
[01:44:49.904 --> 01:44:50.504]  All right, stay there.
[01:44:50.744 --> 01:44:52.185]  I know you gotta go, but we gotta go to break.
[01:44:52.505 --> 01:44:53.345]  New stuff just broke.
[01:44:54.110 --> 01:44:57.155]  Jack Posobiec, Facebook just scrubbed his account just seconds ago.
[01:44:59.688 --> 01:45:00.128]  I mean, folks.
[01:45:00.148 --> 01:45:00.609]  Oh, there you go.
[01:45:00.929 --> 01:45:01.169]  Folks.
[01:45:01.609 --> 01:45:11.936]  Well, Mark Zuckerberg has a chance to stand up to what he's been saying lately, and he could release it if he wanted to, if he wants to tell us that he's really on the side of truth and transparency, or he can comply with the deep state.
[01:45:11.976 --> 01:45:13.337]  Mark Zuckerberg, the choice is yours.
[01:45:13.857 --> 01:45:16.118]  And that's all the private stuff he's got on there should be released.
[01:45:16.478 --> 01:45:18.360]  Well, you know the FBI told him to take that down.
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:19.500]  We've got to go to break.
[01:45:20.021 --> 01:45:20.861]  People can follow you.
[01:45:20.921 --> 01:45:23.283]  Just type in Jack Posobiec on X. You can't miss Jack Posobiec.
[01:45:23.723 --> 01:45:24.604]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:24.804 --> 01:45:25.304]  Stay right there.
[01:45:25.364 --> 01:45:26.064]  Five more minutes with us.
[01:45:26.084 --> 01:45:27.565]  After two minutes, I want to recap this.
[01:45:28.766 --> 01:45:45.300]  Now, the reported identity, the Sheriff's Department, and you tie it back to this guy, and it is the same photo of the same guy they had detained there, so it appears to be him, and he's heavily involved in the whole Ukraine operation, just as Jack Posobiec predicted here months ago, that that's where these attacks will be coming from.
[01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:48.563]  He nailed it, just like they use Cuba-style people to go after Kennedy.
[01:45:53.177 --> 01:46:01.322]  All right, final segment with Jack Posobiec, then I'll join spaces with a bunch of folks to take their comments and analysis, Nick Sartor and others, here in about six minutes.
[01:46:02.503 --> 01:46:03.663]  But this just broke in the last 30.
[01:46:04.104 --> 01:46:05.765]  Facebook has taken it down.
[01:46:07.085 --> 01:46:19.233]  But this is the person reportedly in custody, and it's the same guy in the photos on his Facebook and other places, Ryan Routh, who was in the video still being arrested by the police.
[01:46:19.273 --> 01:46:21.174]  He was in the Ukrainian Foreign Legion.
[01:46:21.194 --> 01:46:22.375]  The documents were on his Facebook.
[01:46:23.135 --> 01:46:28.917]  Look, Alex, we're in a situation, I think, where Donald Trump has now survived more assassination attempts than Kamala Harris has had interviews.
[01:46:52.113 --> 01:46:56.258]  No, look, we know that Ukraine has been a nexus for CIA activity.
[01:46:56.578 --> 01:47:08.192]  We know that the CIA was directly training, and even the New York Times has reported the CIA was directly training Ukrainian death squads, directly training their individuals that were over.
[01:47:08.312 --> 01:47:12.317]  And of course, we also know that the New York Times and others have reported
[01:47:12.577 --> 01:47:12.757]  I think?
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:43.845]  Going into combat and we're starting to see pictures of him and we're starting to see things come out that basically it looks as though this guy wasn't just there for fun.
[01:47:43.885 --> 01:47:58.173]  That this guy was actively involved in combat operations in Ukraine and he came back to the United States and attempted to use that training and that battlefield experience against President Trump, penetrating the foliage, penetrating the tree line and the shrubbery.
[01:47:59.073 --> 01:48:05.937]  Along the Trump golf course, and then use that to go and attempt to get close enough to President Trump that he could take him out.
[01:48:05.978 --> 01:48:08.899]  And of course, people were saying at first that it was an AK-47.
[01:48:08.999 --> 01:48:14.783]  Also, now there's information that potentially it was a, like a Drovogunov or a PK-7.
[01:48:14.863 --> 01:48:23.429]  So, you know, a more of a sniper rifle type variant from that, you know, perhaps may look similar to an AK-47 for folks who aren't familiar.
[01:48:24.129 --> 01:48:28.372]  And that it looks as though he also had partnered, there's even a report from Semaphore
[01:48:28.873 --> 01:48:35.872]  From about a year ago that says, I've had partners meetings with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense every week.
[01:48:36.826 --> 01:48:45.871]  So he was meeting on a weekly basis with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, which we know, by the way, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and the Ukrainian government have been riddled with U.S.
[01:48:45.891 --> 01:48:58.619]  control, Victoria Nuland, with direct control, direct run by the State Department and the CIA operatives, that this is exactly what we have been warning about for a long time, that something bad would come out of this nexus.
[01:48:59.019 --> 01:49:04.142]  I didn't realize that something would come all the way from Ukraine to Mar-a-Lago or to the
[01:49:06.503 --> 01:49:23.693]  And Jack, when we went live two hours and three minutes ago, I posted on X that this is all about the coming full war and bombardment of Russia, and that this is paving the way for full war to get rid of Trump.
[01:49:24.373 --> 01:49:25.314]  Here's an overhead shot.
[01:49:26.054 --> 01:49:29.116]  This is a global nuclear war alert.
[01:49:29.952 --> 01:49:42.138]  A successful assassination of President Trump in Florida today would have cleared the way for the Biden administration and NATO to launch full war with Russia days after Biden authorized NATO bombing of Russian Federation.
[01:49:42.699 --> 01:49:47.201]  And boom, now it's tied right back to Ukraine, what we know is run by NATO and the CIA.
[01:49:47.241 --> 01:49:48.461]  This is smoking gun crap.
[01:49:48.501 --> 01:49:49.262]  This is insane.
[01:49:51.209 --> 01:49:53.750]  Look, this is this is NATO, this is CIA.
[01:49:53.810 --> 01:50:01.535]  This is a huge, huge issue for Zelensky, for NATO, for all the rest of them to talk about these.
[01:50:01.575 --> 01:50:05.417]  So we've talked about NATO, the online information warfare arm of this.
[01:50:05.717 --> 01:50:08.739]  But this is on the ground international fighter flow.
[01:50:09.179 --> 01:50:10.520]  This was direct
[01:50:10.925 --> 01:50:11.885]  Radicalization
[01:50:31.272 --> 01:50:34.094]  I always have to keep saying this, but this isn't about the people of Ukraine.
[01:50:34.354 --> 01:50:40.259]  This is about the deep state and the globalists using Ukraine for their operations.
[01:50:40.279 --> 01:50:40.920]  They've been using it.
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:42.141]  They've been radicalizing people.
[01:50:42.341 --> 01:50:46.504]  They are desperate to hide what's going on there, and they know if President Trump comes back, he'll expose all of it.
[01:50:46.804 --> 01:50:48.424]  I know if they get Trump, they're coming after us.
[01:50:48.464 --> 01:50:49.445]  This is so huge.
[01:50:49.505 --> 01:50:50.125]  It's so real.
[01:50:50.185 --> 01:50:50.885]  It's not a drama.
[01:50:50.925 --> 01:50:51.665]  It's not a video game.
[01:50:51.685 --> 01:50:52.425]  It's not a TV show.
[01:50:52.845 --> 01:50:53.986]  Recap what you just said.
[01:50:54.026 --> 01:50:55.006]  You predicted it all.
[01:50:56.066 --> 01:51:00.047]  Literally, I said before we even knew this, hours before, I said this is about war with Russia.
[01:51:00.327 --> 01:51:07.689]  This is about making sure Trump's out of the way before the massive escalation that Biden just greenlit Friday that has Russia saying we'll officially be at war with the United States.
[01:51:08.109 --> 01:51:10.291]  This is America in a civil war.
[01:51:10.551 --> 01:51:12.012]  We're being peaceful in an info war.
[01:51:12.092 --> 01:51:13.853]  They're getting violent because they're losing.
[01:51:13.973 --> 01:51:15.955]  Recap what you just said for everybody.
[01:51:16.295 --> 01:51:20.718]  And then what do you think Trump should do not putting himself in this position anymore?
[01:51:20.738 --> 01:51:23.020]  Because they're trying to kill him because they know he's going to win.
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:24.201]  The polls are fake.
[01:51:24.241 --> 01:51:30.065]  We know the ground numbers and we know he's got a lot of courage, but discretion is the better part of valor.
[01:51:30.325 --> 01:51:31.966]  We need to protect Trump at all costs.
[01:51:32.186 --> 01:51:34.168]  So recap what you were saying and then give me your take on that.
[01:51:35.029 --> 01:51:42.487]  Well, I will also say that, of course, Donald Trump, as we've clearly seen, is protected by the armor of God and is protected by the hand of God.
[01:51:42.507 --> 01:51:43.791]  And we've seen that twice now.
[01:51:44.232 --> 01:51:48.273]  New reports are coming out saying that the shooter was only 300 to 500 yards away.
[01:51:48.333 --> 01:51:52.474]  Again, a couple of golf holes away from where President Trump was golfing.
[01:51:52.774 --> 01:51:59.836]  The fact that he was able to get into, to gain access to through the security perimeter, he would have had a clean shot.
[01:51:59.936 --> 01:52:05.457]  I was told that he would have had a line of sight on President Trump within just about one hole of golf.
[01:52:05.477 --> 01:52:12.019]  So within just a few minutes, and again, we're seeing a situation here where someone has come out of the nexus.
[01:52:12.612 --> 01:52:23.614]  Of NATO, CIA, foreign fighter operations on the ground in Ukraine has now gotten the training, the battlefield experience, the combat experience to the United States.
[01:52:23.654 --> 01:52:31.916]  And one of the first messages I received, Alex, even before I knew anything about Ukraine, even before anything was mentioned about this, someone told me, I'll just read it again.
[01:52:33.156 --> 01:52:36.837]  When they broke, and I got this from a White House official.
[01:52:37.537 --> 01:52:45.480]  When they broke it, so we're talking about Secret Service, when they broke ranks to get to a hard point and return from cover, he breached the bubble for 15 seconds or so before retreating.
[01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:50.062]  It was a solid fighting stance too, definitely trained for this.
[01:52:50.402 --> 01:53:03.728]  So I received information from one of my sources that this guy seemed like he had combat experience or military training, and then minutes later, we get his name, we go to his, and I did put the tweet up at the time,
[01:53:04.144 --> 01:53:06.185]  And then we get his name, we get his information.
[01:53:06.325 --> 01:53:11.468]  Turns out that it looks like he may have actually been, and he was, on the battlefield in Ukraine.
[01:53:11.488 --> 01:53:12.869]  So these people are coming back over.
[01:53:13.089 --> 01:53:14.310]  They're highly radicalized.
[01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:16.471]  They're hearing President Trump say that he wants peace.
[01:53:16.511 --> 01:53:17.452]  They don't want peace.
[01:53:17.672 --> 01:53:19.593]  They are escalating towards World War III.
[01:53:19.713 --> 01:53:22.635]  Alex, that's exactly what I warned just a few days ago.
[01:53:22.895 --> 01:53:25.156]  And I wonder how he knew to just drop in right on that road close to Trump.
[01:53:25.176 --> 01:53:26.276]  All of this is beyond suspicious.
[01:53:26.296 --> 01:53:27.476]  Why would Facebook delete Ryan Roth's page?
[01:53:50.779 --> 01:53:55.080]  Look, so Elon Musk versus Mark Zuckerberg, and we can see the difference now.
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:54:00.622]  So Elon Musk has allowed this guy, Ryan Routh, tweets about Donald Trump, about Tulsi Gabbard.
[01:54:00.642 --> 01:54:03.883]  He's targeted many, by the way, many politicians to go up against them.
[01:54:04.303 --> 01:54:05.823]  Elon Musk has allowed it to stay up.
[01:54:05.983 --> 01:54:13.766]  Mark Zuckerberg apparently has complied directly with likely Secret Service and or FBI to take it down immediately.
[01:54:13.906 --> 01:54:17.707]  Any information about his associates, any information about his travels or posts.
[01:54:18.027 --> 01:54:19.687]  Has now all potentially been scrubbed.
[01:54:19.707 --> 01:54:25.608]  So Mark Zuckerberg, Mark Zuckerberg, you say that you want to, that you want to be on the side of freedom.
[01:54:25.648 --> 01:54:27.229]  You want it to be on the side of patriotism.
[01:54:27.269 --> 01:54:29.089]  You're going around doing MMA.
[01:54:29.369 --> 01:54:31.209]  You're doing your wakeboarding with the American flag.
[01:54:31.229 --> 01:54:33.130]  Well, stand up and be an American, Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:54:33.450 --> 01:54:34.350]  Leave the account up.
[01:54:34.690 --> 01:54:38.891]  Stand up and be an American and release the information about the shooter.
[01:54:38.991 --> 01:54:41.071]  You own that information, Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:54:41.411 --> 01:54:44.032]  That is the checkbox that everybody has to put in.
[01:54:44.072 --> 01:54:45.712]  So if Mark Zuckerberg owns the information,
[01:54:46.252 --> 01:54:53.279]  You can go right now and put it public, or you can tweet it out on X, or whatever you want to do, but this is the time to stand and be measured.
[01:54:53.319 --> 01:54:53.539]  Yes.
[01:54:53.559 --> 01:54:57.863]  So if Mark Zuckerberg, if you want to stand and be measured, you have the opportunity to do so, sir.
[01:54:57.923 --> 01:54:58.664]  The choice is yours.
[01:54:58.684 --> 01:55:00.005]  Alright, closing statement.
[01:55:00.025 --> 01:55:01.446]  I want you to go back to my question.
[01:55:02.007 --> 01:55:03.588]  What do you think Trump should do?
[01:55:03.708 --> 01:55:05.490]  I mean, he's not cowardly, he's smart.
[01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:08.773]  If he pulls back and is even more careful, and then...
[01:55:10.586 --> 01:55:20.328]  How do you think Trump right now should respond to this with all the news coming out of what we said two months ago that the Secret Service stood down, they lied, they opened the door, bare minimum criminal negligence by design?
[01:55:21.709 --> 01:55:26.570]  Look, President Trump at this point, and I think a lot of people have been saying this over and over, he's got to call in Eric Prince.
[01:55:26.610 --> 01:55:35.012]  He's got to call in Eric Prince or someone to run private security for him, to someone to control not just the venues, but at all times, at all times.
[01:55:35.092 --> 01:55:40.053]  Because clearly what's going on, it has been penetrated multiple times now.
[01:55:40.433 --> 01:55:42.954]  There's some whatever it is right now is not good enough.
[01:55:42.994 --> 01:55:57.957]  You need number one, of course, needs presidential level security, something the Biden White House continues to to decline to continues to refuse to give full presidential security to Donald Trump, where now we have not just one but two assassination attempts on him.
[01:55:57.977 --> 01:56:01.118]  And I'm, of course, working with my publishers because, look, Alex, we were doing the book.
[01:56:01.158 --> 01:56:03.798]  We were doing bulletproof the whole thing the first time around.
[01:56:03.878 --> 01:56:04.739]  And now this happens.
[01:56:04.859 --> 01:56:06.359]  I got on the phone with them and I said, guys,
[01:56:06.894 --> 01:56:07.674]  Stop the presses.
[01:56:07.834 --> 01:56:09.135]  Stop the presses immediately.
[01:56:09.295 --> 01:56:11.315]  I want a full chapter on this or a micro chat.
[01:56:11.355 --> 01:56:12.176]  Whatever we can do.
[01:56:12.616 --> 01:56:18.377]  Whatever we can do because the American people need all of this information as much as possible.
[01:56:18.397 --> 01:56:19.958]  I don't even care how much money it cost me.
[01:56:20.198 --> 01:56:21.458]  I don't care how much money it cost me.
[01:56:21.478 --> 01:56:22.719]  We're going to get this information out.
[01:56:22.779 --> 01:56:28.861]  And you're going to join me and Tucker Carlson, not this Monday, but next Monday in eight days in Redding, Pennsylvania for Tucker's big event.
[01:56:29.161 --> 01:56:30.461]  TuckerCarlson.com.
[01:56:30.481 --> 01:56:33.042]  Alex, the bulletproof briefing just got twice as long.
[01:56:34.073 --> 01:56:34.313]  All right.
[01:56:34.334 --> 01:56:35.456]  We look forward to seeing you.
[01:56:35.476 --> 01:56:39.904]  You're going to be popping back in tomorrow at 1230 Eastern, 1230 p.m.
[01:56:39.924 --> 01:56:40.385]  Eastern, right?
[01:56:41.367 --> 01:56:42.268]  Back to report with tomorrow.
[01:56:42.569 --> 01:56:42.829]  Thank you.
[01:56:42.849 --> 01:56:43.731]  We'll talk to you again real soon.
[01:56:43.771 --> 01:56:44.092]  Thank you, Jack.
[01:56:49.586 --> 01:56:49.946]  We're good to go.
[01:57:07.253 --> 01:57:08.274]  In world history right now.
[01:57:08.474 --> 01:57:09.895]  Even mainline analysts are saying that.
[01:57:09.936 --> 01:57:18.203]  So pray to God for justice and peace and for enemies to be shut down and confounded because I just cannot describe to you how serious the situation is.
[01:57:18.643 --> 01:57:22.366]  Now I've got a black screen and we can punch up the feed for xSpaces.
[01:57:23.567 --> 01:57:30.133]  Our xSpaces that we use to take HD audio comments and statements from folks on there.
[01:57:30.554 --> 01:57:31.815]  I was going to go on with Mario DeFault.
[01:57:31.835 --> 01:57:34.197]  I was also going to go on with Nick Sartor on their streams but
[01:57:35.503 --> 01:57:39.428]  We already launched the stream, so you can't have a stream going and then also use my ex account.
[01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:41.511]  So we'll run this a while.
[01:57:41.551 --> 01:57:47.760]  Then I do intend to get on with Nick and get on with Mara and a fall on their streams later as well.
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:49.362]  But I want to go ahead and punch up.
[01:57:50.663 --> 01:57:51.283]  I think so.
[01:58:20.779 --> 01:58:21.960]  This is so dangerous.
[01:58:21.980 --> 01:58:23.201]  This is so insane.
[01:58:24.002 --> 01:58:25.183]  How did I call it?
[01:58:25.543 --> 01:58:27.524]  Because it's about World War III.
[01:58:28.485 --> 01:58:30.086]  And they use a Ukrainian U.S.
[01:58:30.186 --> 01:58:30.967]  asset to do it.
[01:58:32.328 --> 01:58:34.750]  Thank God he didn't get killed or they'd say he was an Iranian.
[01:58:36.451 --> 01:58:37.512]  This is so sick.
[01:58:38.933 --> 01:58:41.936]  Chase, guys, give me your take on all this, then bring in Nick Sartor whenever you're ready.
[01:58:42.932 --> 01:58:45.613]  Yeah, I mean, I don't even know what to think, Alex.
[01:58:45.953 --> 01:58:54.034]  It feels exactly like July 13th, and you know, the thing that came to mind to me, Alex, was, you know, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.
[01:58:54.915 --> 01:58:58.055]  At this point in time, it's just ridiculous that there's been two attempts within two months.
[01:58:58.075 --> 01:59:02.876]  This is historic, never happened before as far as I understand or know in the history of U.S.
[01:59:02.936 --> 01:59:06.137]  politics, two assassination attempts in such quick...
[01:59:06.917 --> 01:59:07.958]  Proximity to one another.
[01:59:07.978 --> 01:59:09.639]  I want to hear from from Nick Sorter.
[01:59:09.719 --> 01:59:12.922]  Nick, go ahead if you're there and unmute yourself and share what you have to say.
[01:59:12.982 --> 01:59:15.584]  I know you have some inside information about what's going on with Facebook.
[01:59:17.165 --> 01:59:17.726]  Absolutely.
[01:59:17.806 --> 01:59:32.738]  So I am, I work pretty closely with someone who is a, let's just say we call them a high-ranking individual at Meta that did confirm to me that, and I don't know there's a lot of background, I was just letting you guys know that we're just going through the space through Alex's mic,
[01:59:33.278 --> 01:59:33.598]  We're good.
[01:59:48.646 --> 01:59:49.066]  We're good.
[02:00:04.842 --> 02:00:08.783]  Speaking to the fact that this has happened, obviously, a second time.
[02:00:08.803 --> 02:00:24.707]  They've been demanding a lot more resources, and we heard the Secret Service earlier say during the press conference that the reason they didn't protect and have a perimeter around the entire golf course is because he's not the President of the United States.
[02:00:24.927 --> 02:00:31.029]  Now, I'm gonna make this point right here, and I'm opening this up to anybody that wants to argue with me for it.
[02:00:31.764 --> 02:00:36.227]  Donald Trump is a much bigger target than Joe Biden is.
[02:00:36.548 --> 02:00:38.749]  Nobody cares about Joe Biden.
[02:00:39.009 --> 02:00:44.133]  Nobody cares to go—if they take out Joe Biden, he's not running the country anyway.
[02:00:44.453 --> 02:00:45.834]  Somebody else is running the country.
[02:00:46.075 --> 02:00:49.477]  They get Kamala Harris, which is controlled by exactly the same people— Nick, let me just interrupt you.
[02:00:49.497 --> 02:00:51.138]  Let me interrupt you and just say you're totally right.
[02:00:51.879 --> 02:00:53.480]  Mayorkas is over the Secret Service.
[02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:54.281]  Biden's over that.
[02:00:55.250 --> 02:00:56.611]  The FBI is under Merrick Garland.
[02:00:56.631 --> 02:00:58.151]  They're covering up the last thing.
[02:00:58.351 --> 02:00:59.332]  And Butler, that's all come out.
[02:00:59.372 --> 02:01:03.853]  They are deliberately opening the doors to get killed Trump, to get Trump killed.
[02:01:04.214 --> 02:01:06.314]  They're deliberately opening the doors to get Trump killed.
[02:01:06.895 --> 02:01:10.956]  They are totally accomplices to this latest attack and to the first one.
[02:01:10.976 --> 02:01:11.716]  They're caught red-handed.
[02:01:11.736 --> 02:01:12.457]  Give me your take on that.
[02:01:12.517 --> 02:01:12.877]  Nick Sordor.
[02:01:15.001 --> 02:01:15.702]  No, absolutely.
[02:01:15.722 --> 02:01:21.306]  At this point, you know, no matter what you think, we've been saying that this was going to happen again.
[02:01:21.767 --> 02:01:30.714]  And obviously the Trump campaign and even Trump's immediate body detail, the guys that are surrounding him, they're the most important parts of the detail.
[02:01:31.194 --> 02:01:34.657]  They have been continuously requesting more resources.
[02:01:34.877 --> 02:01:37.019]  They still have not gotten them.
[02:01:37.359 --> 02:01:43.183]  Even after Trump was literally shot there in Pennsylvania, they still didn't give him the additional resources.
[02:01:43.443 --> 02:01:48.386]  They still didn't give him the presidential-level detail that, honestly, that he deserves.
[02:01:50.028 --> 02:01:54.911]  Like I said, this guy is a lot more of a target than Joe Biden is.
[02:01:55.591 --> 02:02:02.536]  I go to Trump rallies all around the country at this point, and they still have not banned rangefinders.
[02:02:02.836 --> 02:02:08.699]  You can still bring a rangefinder into a Trump rally, but you can't bring a water bottle with a lid on it.
[02:02:08.779 --> 02:02:12.560]  You have to go inside and you can buy a water bottle, but you have to take the lid off and everything.
[02:02:12.580 --> 02:02:13.881]  These people aren't serious.
[02:02:14.201 --> 02:02:21.124]  So at a very minimum, Alex, they are complicit in these continued assassination attempts based on their inaction.
[02:02:21.424 --> 02:02:27.627]  At a maximum, they're in on it and they're purposely not doing anything more to protect him because they want him to be shot.
[02:02:28.007 --> 02:02:31.589]  They have changed almost nothing since he was shot the first time.
[02:02:33.032 --> 02:02:34.793]  Now let me add the biggest takeaway I've got.
[02:02:34.813 --> 02:02:36.495]  I want everybody to listen to me very, very carefully.
[02:02:38.436 --> 02:02:49.445]  Jack Posobiec, I've known eight plus years, we were the first to get him on air, I guess nine years now, about a year before the election, did a great job in China and all over the world for naval intelligence.
[02:02:49.465 --> 02:02:54.368]  He did real work for our country against the Chinese communists, in-country, as an undercover spy, you name it.
[02:02:55.509 --> 02:03:00.073]  And he's always had great sources, but he has the best sources in the Pentagon and with Trump.
[02:03:01.622 --> 02:03:07.727]  And he kept coming on, we're going to find the clips because it's so amazing, saying they're going to use Ukrainian cutouts, U.S.
[02:03:07.767 --> 02:03:11.310]  people that have trained in a foreign legion to come back and try to kill Trump.
[02:03:11.330 --> 02:03:12.651]  He said, look at that in Butler.
[02:03:13.792 --> 02:03:15.653]  Look at the shooter Crooks being connected to that.
[02:03:15.773 --> 02:03:17.935]  He didn't even remember saying that when I brought it up on air.
[02:03:18.115 --> 02:03:18.536]  I remember.
[02:03:19.679 --> 02:03:25.762]  And then I come out and say they're going to probably connect this somehow to get rid of Trump for World War III with the Russians out.
[02:03:25.782 --> 02:03:28.063]  They've announced this missile bombardment plan last Friday.
[02:03:28.784 --> 02:03:31.925]  And then within two hours of that, it comes out that he is in the Foreign Legion.
[02:03:32.385 --> 02:03:34.747]  He did work for the Ukrainian military in the Pentagon.
[02:03:34.887 --> 02:03:35.767]  That's the CIA.
[02:03:36.187 --> 02:03:37.988]  And then he then just came and tried to kill Trump.
[02:03:38.008 --> 02:03:41.190]  So this is a deep state shadow army operative.
[02:03:42.196 --> 02:03:46.600]  That knew right where to drop in, right when, to try to kill Trump.
[02:03:46.700 --> 02:03:47.700]  Guaranteed had help.
[02:03:47.981 --> 02:03:50.182]  This is completely obvious, Nick Sordor.
[02:03:50.723 --> 02:03:52.444]  I want your take on that, then we'll come back to you.
[02:03:52.484 --> 02:03:55.607]  I want to get Harrison Smith and other people here in the space's take.
[02:03:55.647 --> 02:03:59.350]  But to me, these documents, this information's all at Real Alex Jones right now.
[02:03:59.370 --> 02:04:00.871]  You know, we've retweeted it.
[02:04:00.951 --> 02:04:02.192]  It's all his documents.
[02:04:02.612 --> 02:04:03.513]  All of it is on the site.
[02:04:04.033 --> 02:04:04.974]  They're on X. Get it.
[02:04:05.555 --> 02:04:08.377]  And the fact, as you said, Nick, they're covering this up shows they don't want this known.
[02:04:08.417 --> 02:04:09.438]  This is insane.
[02:04:11.107 --> 02:04:16.833]  No, it absolutely is insane, and I know there are probably a lot of people here that are fans of Dan Bongino, who was an ex-Secret Service agent.
[02:04:16.873 --> 02:04:25.741]  He's saying that it looks like this was an off-the-record movement for President Trump, which security ends up being handled differently and such, which should definitely be changed at this point.
[02:04:25.962 --> 02:04:27.363]  But how did this guy know?
[02:04:27.383 --> 02:04:29.465]  Because he's not from there, right?
[02:04:29.485 --> 02:04:31.367]  He's from... I've been looking to... I've had...
[02:04:31.747 --> 02:04:36.751]  My entire team going through the reports, like the background reports on this guy.
[02:04:36.851 --> 02:04:42.075]  I have my people on the ground in Hawaii that are literally going and visiting the registered addresses to him out there.
[02:04:42.355 --> 02:04:43.576]  He's not from Florida.
[02:04:43.796 --> 02:04:45.618]  He doesn't have any connection to Florida.
[02:04:45.838 --> 02:04:49.400]  His connections are for Hawaii and North Carolina.
[02:04:49.741 --> 02:04:57.666]  How did he know that Trump was going to be at the golf course there in West Palm Beach today?
[02:04:57.987 --> 02:04:59.688]  How did he know when he was going to be there?
[02:04:59.988 --> 02:05:00.889]  What was this guy doing?
[02:05:01.309 --> 02:05:02.510]  How did he have that information?
[02:05:02.710 --> 02:05:03.771]  That's what we don't know yet.
[02:05:05.852 --> 02:05:08.333]  If you ask me, there's a hell of a lot fishy about that.
[02:05:08.613 --> 02:05:24.683]  Even as a journalist, even as a guy that goes around to different events with President Trump and sort of follows him around the country, it's hard for me even to know where Trump is going to be, let alone some Ukrainian shill from North Carolina that supposedly owns a tiny home business.
[02:05:24.923 --> 02:05:25.603]  How did that happen?
[02:05:25.784 --> 02:05:26.424]  That's what I want to know.
[02:05:28.092 --> 02:05:30.574]  Well, we know we can't have the FBI do the investigation.
[02:05:30.614 --> 02:05:32.796]  That's exactly what Eric Prince is saying.
[02:05:32.816 --> 02:05:39.742]  We just reposted on X his statements to Benny Johnson and others.
[02:05:39.782 --> 02:05:40.903]  In fact, get that clip, guys.
[02:05:40.943 --> 02:05:43.986]  I'm about to post on X. We just did post to X. Nick, stay there.
[02:05:44.026 --> 02:05:44.746]  Please don't leave.
[02:05:45.587 --> 02:05:53.214]  Let's get Chase Geiser's take on this, and then we'll go to our fellow InfoWars host, host of American Journal, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[02:05:53.254 --> 02:05:54.355]  Central, Harrison Smith.
[02:05:55.785 --> 02:06:05.028]  Yeah, like I said, Alex, I don't know what to think, but we've known that Ukraine has been a CIA cutout since at least 2014, and obviously they're trying to kill him.
[02:06:05.048 --> 02:06:06.608]  It's not a coincidence that this is happening.
[02:06:06.628 --> 02:06:15.350]  You know, Steve Bannon, you mentioned him briefly earlier, of course he's in prison now because of his political persuasion, has a famous saying in the background of his show, The War Room.
[02:06:15.670 --> 02:06:21.012]  I think it says, there are no cons... I can't remember exactly how it's phrased, but it's something about, it's not...
[02:06:22.332 --> 02:06:25.514]  It's not a conspiracy, but there are no coincidences at the same time, right?
[02:06:26.014 --> 02:06:33.797]  And though I do think that this is a conspiracy to kill Donald Trump, we have to look beyond this as a coincidence.
[02:06:34.157 --> 02:06:39.560]  I think the left is going to try to, we're going to see the Krasensteins, the Sissons, and others try to frame this as a rogue coincidence.
[02:06:39.580 --> 02:06:43.522]  They're going to try to say that we need to have gun reform and assault weapon bans.
[02:06:43.742 --> 02:06:46.623]  Kamala Harris just the other day posted that she wanted to ban all assault weapons.
[02:06:46.923 --> 02:06:48.544]  This is the angle that the left is going to take.
[02:06:49.451 --> 02:06:57.737]  They're going to say that this is an assault weapon issue, but they're actually responsible for it themselves by conspiring against the American people.
[02:06:59.178 --> 02:07:11.526]  Bottom line, Trump's would-be assassin is now a confirmed CIA-Ukraine war foreign legion cutout who knew right when to drop in at an unannounced event that nobody knew Trump was going to be there.
[02:07:12.432 --> 02:07:15.740]  And that's what they're saying, Bongino is saying, and I'll go with Sartor, he's a great source.
[02:07:16.201 --> 02:07:20.050]  We'll go back to Sartor Amendment and then other speakers, but right now, let's go to Harrison Smith.
[02:07:20.070 --> 02:07:20.370]  Harrison.
[02:07:22.086 --> 02:07:27.929]  Yeah, no, I think you're exactly right to question, you know, how this guy knew where to go, how he knew exactly where to be.
[02:07:27.989 --> 02:07:29.410]  Tons of questions swirling about this.
[02:07:29.870 --> 02:07:30.310]  But you know what?
[02:07:30.951 --> 02:07:32.011]  Forget the Ukraine thing.
[02:07:32.031 --> 02:07:33.052]  Forget the Russian thing.
[02:07:33.072 --> 02:07:36.493]  To me, this is about the staccatic terror of the left.
[02:07:36.573 --> 02:07:39.335]  This is about radicalized Democrats.
[02:07:39.575 --> 02:07:43.557]  I mean, we know this guy donated to tons of Democrat causes.
[02:07:44.057 --> 02:07:51.461]  They don't even have the false claim that they did with Butler Pennsylvania that, well, he registered for Republican, you know, as a joke one time three months ago.
[02:07:52.105 --> 02:07:57.826]  This guy's clearly a hardcore believer in what they say, which is Donald Trump is an existential crisis.
[02:07:57.866 --> 02:07:59.046]  He's a threat to democracy.
[02:07:59.066 --> 02:08:06.088]  I mean, they are continually signaling that Trump needs to die and that democracy will die if somebody doesn't take him out.
[02:08:06.508 --> 02:08:16.590]  So, you know, as tantalizing and, you know, almost certainly going to be found to be true, the connections to the deep state and CIA, I mean, this guy glows in a word, right?
[02:08:16.610 --> 02:08:18.010]  This guy is clearly
[02:08:18.872 --> 02:08:23.377]  Clearly, intel adjacent, if not involved in the intelligence agencies.
[02:08:23.717 --> 02:08:30.884]  But beyond that, this is the rhetoric that they talk about being a danger to democracy.
[02:08:31.064 --> 02:08:32.225]  And I'm not calling for censorship.
[02:08:32.245 --> 02:08:33.387]  I don't think there should be censorship.
[02:08:33.767 --> 02:08:36.710]  But I'm a little bit annoyed that Trump is joking about that.
[02:08:36.910 --> 02:08:38.912]  And again, you know, this is Trump.
[02:08:38.932 --> 02:08:39.673]  We know who he is.
[02:08:39.713 --> 02:08:40.674]  We know how he reacts.
[02:08:41.698 --> 02:08:52.044]  I don't want to throw shade at the guy when he survives his second assassination attempt in as many months, but when he's going, you know, I wish I could have finished the whole, I was too under par.
[02:08:52.164 --> 02:08:55.506]  It's like, dude, there are Trump supporters being beaten in the streets.
[02:08:55.666 --> 02:08:56.866]  They're trying to kill you.
[02:08:56.886 --> 02:08:59.608]  He's got to take this seriously.
[02:08:59.668 --> 02:09:02.269]  And it's not even that I think he's handling it incorrectly.
[02:09:02.309 --> 02:09:04.550]  It's almost like he doesn't get it.
[02:09:04.711 --> 02:09:06.672]  It's almost like he doesn't understand.
[02:09:08.106 --> 02:09:09.047]  They're trying to kill him.
[02:09:09.087 --> 02:09:10.227]  He's not taking it seriously.
[02:09:10.568 --> 02:09:17.232]  And not even for his own sake, but I think just for the sake of his supporters and the violence and rhetoric and demonization that we're subjected to.
[02:09:17.512 --> 02:09:23.276]  You know, you've got people like- Well, that's why the deep state hates Trump, because I've been around Trump only a few times, talked to him on the phone a lot.
[02:09:23.666 --> 02:09:26.667]  He, the presence he has is intimidating.
[02:09:26.707 --> 02:09:27.487]  I don't get intimidated.
[02:09:27.507 --> 02:09:29.027]  He's like, whoa, his wife too.
[02:09:29.767 --> 02:09:36.108]  And he just is so confident and thinks he's invincible that these people are all a bunch of evil, scared rats.
[02:09:36.148 --> 02:09:37.528]  They go, they just freak out around it.
[02:09:37.548 --> 02:09:38.829]  They don't want to support strength.
[02:09:39.149 --> 02:09:40.029]  They get threatened by it.
[02:09:40.049 --> 02:09:40.569]  You understand?
[02:09:40.609 --> 02:09:51.291]  So I think Trump, I mean, Roger told me this many, like eight years ago, they said Trump is fatalistic in that he just doesn't, it's, it's, it's, I mean, look, he's behind glass now at the rallies.
[02:09:52.771 --> 02:09:56.573]  Eric and others are really pissed and say, my dad doesn't have endless lives.
[02:09:56.654 --> 02:10:02.597]  They're going to get word to him that, and this talk about, well, he won't look tough if he doesn't keep doing this.
[02:10:02.657 --> 02:10:05.018]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:10:05.318 --> 02:10:07.499]  If he comes out and says, well, obviously they can't protect me.
[02:10:07.519 --> 02:10:09.240]  The deep state's out to kill me and I'm already going to win.
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:09.881]  I'm way ahead.
[02:10:10.481 --> 02:10:14.063]  And so, you know, look, they're going to keep trying.
[02:10:14.363 --> 02:10:15.123]  That much is clear.
[02:10:15.163 --> 02:10:16.364]  Harrison, I'll come back to you.
[02:10:16.684 --> 02:10:17.925]  Nick Sordor, can you speak to that?
[02:10:17.965 --> 02:10:19.826]  And then I'm going to go to some other speakers and stay on with us.
[02:10:24.039 --> 02:10:24.780]  Let's go back to Nick.
[02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:27.145]  Nick, I mean, what do you think about what he just said?
[02:10:27.325 --> 02:10:28.727]  I mean, a criticism of Trump here.
[02:10:29.248 --> 02:10:30.591]  I mean, Trump's our champion.
[02:10:31.012 --> 02:10:31.913]  He is our president.
[02:10:31.953 --> 02:10:33.376]  He can really turn this country around.
[02:10:33.797 --> 02:10:36.762]  And parading around like he's in a shooting gallery is something he needs to stop.
[02:10:36.782 --> 02:10:37.163]  Nick Sordor?
[02:10:38.326 --> 02:10:39.246]  Yeah, sorry about that.
[02:10:39.266 --> 02:10:41.888]  I was actually reviewing another article by the Greensboro.
[02:10:41.908 --> 02:10:44.889]  So apparently this guy, I'll just add this and I'll answer your question.
[02:10:45.349 --> 02:10:51.491]  This guy was featured in the New York Times just last year as an advocate for Ukraine.
[02:10:51.511 --> 02:10:55.813]  The New York Times wrote a piece on this guy back and then there's also the Greensboro Times.
[02:10:55.853 --> 02:11:04.837]  Greensboro, North Carolina wrote a piece on this guy because he fled police from a traffic stop and led them on an entire car chase and then barricaded himself in a room.
[02:11:04.857 --> 02:11:05.917]  So this was a known guy.
[02:11:05.957 --> 02:11:07.278]  This guy was very much known.
[02:11:08.038 --> 02:11:09.801]  No, no, no.
[02:11:10.141 --> 02:11:11.824]  Nick, I have the New York Times profile.
[02:11:11.844 --> 02:11:14.167]  I tweeted it.
[02:11:14.247 --> 02:11:20.697]  They praised him as this incredible fighter recruiting people as a commander for the Foreign Legion.
[02:11:20.997 --> 02:11:21.498]  Absolutely.
[02:11:22.871 --> 02:11:27.895]  And at this point, I'm pretty much assuming anybody that the New York Times endorses probably needs to be on the list.
[02:11:27.915 --> 02:11:30.416]  You know, they want to put people like you and me on no-fly lists.
[02:11:30.797 --> 02:11:32.438]  These are the people that need to be looked at.
[02:11:32.718 --> 02:11:40.043]  I mean, this guy was radicalized by the left, by the loony left, you know, the people that are profiting so bigly on this Ukraine war.
[02:11:40.743 --> 02:11:41.004]  Right?
[02:11:41.084 --> 02:11:44.888]  That are saying that, okay, all the Russian disinformation is deadly.
[02:11:45.068 --> 02:11:49.614]  Well, it turns out that it seems, I guess, the Ukrainian disinformation is being deadly.
[02:11:49.854 --> 02:11:55.821]  Because the frontrunner for President of the United States at this point, there was an attempted assassination on his life.
[02:11:56.523 --> 02:11:59.125]  By somebody radicalized by the left.
[02:11:59.185 --> 02:12:10.434]  Basically pledged his allegiance to Ukraine at this point just based on the propaganda that has been put out by the Biden-Harris regime.
[02:12:10.694 --> 02:12:12.335]  That should terrify everybody.
[02:12:15.198 --> 02:12:16.138]  I totally agree.
[02:12:16.959 --> 02:12:17.600]  Nick, stay there.
[02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:18.340]  I want to come back to you.
[02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:22.203]  I know you're ferreting through news, so we'll come back to you in about 5-10 minutes.
[02:12:22.824 --> 02:12:24.245]  Who should we go to next, Chase Geyser?
[02:12:24.997 --> 02:12:26.378]  Let's go to Colonel Gannon.
[02:12:26.398 --> 02:12:28.039]  Go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say.
[02:12:28.059 --> 02:12:33.123]  Hey guys, we're right at it.
[02:12:33.223 --> 02:12:35.925]  I want to put it back in the moment because I think that is where we are.
[02:12:35.945 --> 02:12:38.967]  We have to take what we're saying right now in the moment.
[02:12:39.047 --> 02:12:46.132]  Right now we've got the deep state and a vice and the vice is President Trump on one side and it's Russia on the other side.
[02:12:46.212 --> 02:12:48.394]  In between are these globalist psychopaths who
[02:12:49.154 --> 02:12:57.796]  They're guilty of crimes against humanity with the vaccines and everything they've done with us, and now those bastards are on the verge of trying to start World War III.
[02:12:57.816 --> 02:13:03.398]  And that's where we go back to the missiles that are coming in to Ukraine right now.
[02:13:04.118 --> 02:13:09.079]  And, you know, for all the things that Trump is doing, that's where we are.
[02:13:09.119 --> 02:13:12.920]  He's one side of that vice, and that's why they tried to take him out in this moment.
[02:13:16.686 --> 02:13:23.950]  You know, Trump is a warrior.
[02:13:24.090 --> 02:13:28.112]  I think he believes, like I do, that God is going to judge us on his timeline.
[02:13:28.152 --> 02:13:33.875]  And I understand, Alex, what you're saying about, hey man, get off the golf course, you know, don't be out there.
[02:13:34.315 --> 02:13:37.617]  But at the same time, he's got to do what he has to do.
[02:13:37.677 --> 02:13:41.119]  That said, we talked earlier when I talked to you about spiritual
[02:13:41.779 --> 02:13:42.480]  I think so.
[02:14:02.816 --> 02:14:03.096]  We're good.
[02:14:27.349 --> 02:14:28.870]  Well, that's my next question for you.
[02:14:28.890 --> 02:14:31.171]  You're a retired naval aviator and a smart guy.
[02:14:31.331 --> 02:14:33.612]  You've been a guest on the show before.
[02:14:46.019 --> 02:14:48.360]  I love how the left's like, oh, Putin always backs down.
[02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:48.840]  No, he didn't.
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:51.341]  He said, if NATO comes into Ukraine, I'm going to invade.
[02:14:51.381 --> 02:14:51.801]  He did.
[02:14:51.861 --> 02:14:54.862]  Now he says it's an act of war and their threat doctrine.
[02:14:54.982 --> 02:14:55.703]  What would the U.S.
[02:14:55.723 --> 02:14:58.284]  do if somebody started shooting missiles into our country?
[02:14:58.704 --> 02:15:01.105]  I mean, I don't see what Russia does if this happens.
[02:15:01.365 --> 02:15:06.807]  And that's now been reported that Biden said, OK, go ahead and do it, but just don't blame the U.S.
[02:15:06.867 --> 02:15:08.087]  Let's not make a big deal about it.
[02:15:08.488 --> 02:15:11.849]  What does he, The New York Times said and The Washington Post and The Leningradian?
[02:15:12.549 --> 02:15:14.630]  What do they think's gonna happen when those missiles detonate?
[02:15:15.010 --> 02:15:16.611]  It's just like blowing up the Nord Stream pipeline.
[02:15:16.631 --> 02:15:17.832]  Everybody knows who's doing it.
[02:15:17.852 --> 02:15:21.014]  I mean, the Easter Bunny's not gonna be firing those at Russia.
[02:15:21.054 --> 02:15:21.694]  What's gonna happen?
[02:15:23.188 --> 02:15:28.189]  Putin is the only adult in the room and he has told you what he is going to do.
[02:15:28.269 --> 02:15:30.710]  And he is actually begging all of us to stand up.
[02:15:30.990 --> 02:15:40.813]  And I'm praying right now that there's somebody of, if somebody has the actual courage within the DOJ to arrest Anthony Blinken.
[02:15:40.913 --> 02:15:52.016]  Because I think if they move those missiles in, then the only thing that will stop Putin from taking us down, if one of those were to fire into it, is the arrest of someone like Anthony Blinken or Mayorkas.
[02:15:58.729 --> 02:16:08.997]  People of the United States who don't want to be destroyed by nuclear conflict take back over their government because right now the people of the United States do not have control of their government.
[02:16:09.377 --> 02:16:11.879]  We have rigged elections and all the polls say it.
[02:16:11.979 --> 02:16:14.561]  Eighty-five percent of Republicans believe the election is rigged.
[02:16:14.841 --> 02:16:17.463]  And oh, by the way, 60 percent of Democrats.
[02:16:17.763 --> 02:16:22.067]  And we can't fight a war like that because none of us want to go into it.
[02:16:22.127 --> 02:16:23.608]  And I spent my entire life
[02:16:24.208 --> 02:16:24.828]  Fighting wars.
[02:16:24.868 --> 02:16:26.749]  I did five combat deployments.
[02:16:26.789 --> 02:16:29.610]  And I'm telling you, the American people don't want to do that.
[02:16:29.650 --> 02:16:39.773]  And the reason I went off to do that is so that we could preserve what we had, you know, albeit I was misled about a lot of things that we were doing at the time.
[02:16:39.833 --> 02:16:50.276]  But at the end of the day, you know, we're not a good actor on the stage right now because we don't have an actual functioning political system because our elections are rigged.
[02:16:50.756 --> 02:16:50.916]  And so
[02:16:56.662 --> 02:17:01.964]  God bless President Trump because he's giving at least the appearance on the world stage that there is hope for the American people.
[02:17:23.146 --> 02:17:23.767]  I totally agree.
[02:17:23.807 --> 02:17:35.257]  For people that weren't an officer in the Marine Corps and who didn't train to fight Russia, for people that don't study military doctrine, I don't know because it's so interesting, since the end of the Cold War,
[02:17:37.469 --> 02:17:41.671]  There were deals not to move weapons up and to take over areas of Eastern Europe.
[02:17:41.691 --> 02:17:42.372]  That's been done.
[02:17:42.472 --> 02:17:43.592]  Ukraine's one of the last now.
[02:17:44.253 --> 02:17:45.073]  And that's the red line.
[02:17:45.093 --> 02:17:51.837]  But if you go back to the beginning of the atomic age, at the end of World War II, I don't think we've ever been, it's hands down, in a situation this dangerous.
[02:17:52.237 --> 02:17:52.938]  And under U.S.
[02:17:52.958 --> 02:18:03.364]  doctrine, Russian doctrine, all doctrine, if a foreign power starts firing heavy missiles that are guided by a country into your nation, it's no longer a proxy war that NATO started 11 years ago in Ukraine.
[02:18:03.744 --> 02:18:05.105]  It's now an official declaration of war.
[02:18:06.125 --> 02:18:14.332]  And then, meanwhile, people like Bolton came out Friday and said, oh, we got a three-to-one conventional military superiority.
[02:18:14.372 --> 02:18:17.134]  We'll beat the Russians in this new war.
[02:18:17.154 --> 02:18:23.980]  Well, that would be horrible enough, that war and conscription and hundreds of thousands, millions probably dead.
[02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:28.684]  But it goes in all the threat analysis and all the war games into nuclear very, very quickly.
[02:18:29.324 --> 02:18:31.946]  That's the doctrine of Russia is when outnumbered use nukes.
[02:18:32.247 --> 02:18:36.871]  That was the doctrine of Western Europe when the Russians outnumbered Western Europe 3 to 1.
[02:18:37.231 --> 02:18:39.253]  So the direct doctrine leads to that.
[02:18:39.733 --> 02:18:41.695]  That's the Rand Corporation threat continuum.
[02:18:41.855 --> 02:18:43.657]  This is the default I'm talking about.
[02:18:43.877 --> 02:18:44.798]  Can you explain that to people?
[02:18:44.818 --> 02:18:51.343]  Well, of course, it's like the complete Dr. Strangelove scenario, right?
[02:18:51.403 --> 02:18:53.505]  Mutually assured destruction.
[02:19:00.225 --> 02:19:08.288]  At the end of the day, the idea is that you actually have a functional political system that isn't suicidal at the top.
[02:19:08.388 --> 02:19:10.769]  And right now, we're not there, Alex.
[02:19:12.149 --> 02:19:12.829]  We're not there.
[02:19:13.229 --> 02:19:22.672]  So what will happen is if we fire, allow our missiles to be fired into Russia, they will annihilate the threat, right?
[02:19:23.092 --> 02:19:27.894]  And then that will give the precursor for what I'm telling you is a non-
[02:19:28.704 --> 02:19:33.508]  accountable, non-functioning political elite that are trying to maintain control.
[02:19:33.588 --> 02:19:45.597]  And frankly, they're suicidal to the point that they would destroy the world instead of seeking any kind of natural peace.
[02:19:45.657 --> 02:19:51.001]  And then once those missiles are in the air, you cannot know where it goes.
[02:19:51.201 --> 02:19:54.143]  I bet your best AI couldn't figure it out.
[02:19:54.184 --> 02:19:57.246]  I'm sure it'd come up with something, but it would not be correct.
[02:19:58.885 --> 02:19:59.666]  That's right, guys.
[02:19:59.706 --> 02:20:01.047]  Keep showing that scenario.
[02:20:01.127 --> 02:20:02.568]  In the United States, we're showing it.
[02:20:02.869 --> 02:20:03.930]  Nuked Russia first.
[02:20:04.130 --> 02:20:07.793]  There's no winner in a nuclear war of this magnitude.
[02:20:07.993 --> 02:20:19.003]  Almost every war game, if the Russians hit the missile fields firing these with tactical nuclear weapons, that is their default doctrine, then I would imagine NATO's going to strike their launch systems with tactical.
[02:20:19.063 --> 02:20:22.927]  And then within a few minutes, the Russians will decide, probably for total commitment.
[02:20:24.007 --> 02:20:27.669]  And again, it's in my report that got about 5 million views, which is good.
[02:20:27.709 --> 02:20:31.231]  He's 100 million that I put out yesterday dealing with this.
[02:20:31.252 --> 02:20:33.753]  But I have the clip of Bolton saying, oh, they'll stand down.
[02:20:33.773 --> 02:20:35.034]  They'll just take us doing this.
[02:20:35.694 --> 02:20:36.374]  They're cowards.
[02:20:36.414 --> 02:20:38.636]  But that isn't the case with Napoleon or Hitler.
[02:20:39.056 --> 02:20:44.679]  The Russians were willing to lose a third of their population in World War II and wipe out a third of the Germans at least.
[02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:49.102]  I mean, let's say there's a 50-50 chance Russia just rolls over.
[02:20:49.822 --> 02:20:51.103]  Alex, that's what I want to get to.
[02:20:51.163 --> 02:20:54.226]  It's not survivable, so I'm asking everybody out there to pray for
[02:21:14.787 --> 02:21:15.187]  We're good to go.
[02:21:40.916 --> 02:21:51.825]  We will be destroyed because we're about to set the entire world on fire because of our incompetent, illegitimate government right now that is running it.
[02:21:51.965 --> 02:21:53.786]  And they are corrupt beyond belief.
[02:21:53.886 --> 02:22:01.032]  And if there's anyone in there in the DOJ or the FBI that has any balls whatsoever and loves their country, now is your time.
[02:22:04.616 --> 02:22:06.398]  Well, there's the problem.
[02:22:06.438 --> 02:22:07.959]  There's the problem.
[02:22:08.019 --> 02:22:10.762]  Merrick Garland is just as crazy as they are, and that's the issue.
[02:22:11.623 --> 02:22:17.810]  A year and a half ago, Biden said, if we have Abrams tanks there, that escalates to World War III.
[02:22:17.850 --> 02:22:21.573]  Now they're already way past that on the threat continuum of the Pentagon.
[02:22:21.593 --> 02:22:22.895]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[02:22:22.935 --> 02:22:23.876]  You're right, Colonel.
[02:22:24.256 --> 02:22:24.977]  It's total madness.
[02:22:24.997 --> 02:22:25.578]  Thank you so much.
[02:22:26.653 --> 02:22:27.595]  All right, this is breaking.
[02:22:27.635 --> 02:22:30.803]  Of course, it broke over an hour ago here with Jack Posobiec on the show.
[02:22:31.605 --> 02:22:34.411]  He broke it before the name was even released, that it was a Ukrainian...
[02:22:36.581 --> 02:22:38.002]  Foreign Legion guy from the U.S.
[02:22:38.022 --> 02:22:45.226]  Now the New York Post, AP, they're all reporting would-be Trump assassin ID'd as Ryan Roth, 58, of Hawaii.
[02:22:45.867 --> 02:22:53.911]  And he is part of a CIA foreign legion and then magically knew when to drop in when it was totally unannounced where Trump was going to be.
[02:22:54.732 --> 02:22:57.173]  That's now confirmed and was very close to him.
[02:22:57.253 --> 02:22:58.034]  So he had help.
[02:22:58.434 --> 02:23:05.358]  This is the type of libtard, looney-tune, nutjobs that wants to kill Trump because he doesn't want World War III.
[02:23:05.378 --> 02:23:05.739]  You have
[02:23:06.839 --> 02:23:10.420]  Sean Penn, a year and a half ago, saying nuclear war is good, let's have one with Russia.
[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:14.621]  I mean, these are lunatic, maniac, crazy people.
[02:23:16.742 --> 02:23:17.702]  I just can't even believe it.
[02:23:18.683 --> 02:23:23.864]  Let's get Nick Sordor's take on what we've just been breaking, because I know he's really good at digging out new news.
[02:23:24.184 --> 02:23:26.665]  Any new developments, Nick Sordor here on The Spaces, and we'll go to other speakers.
[02:23:29.358 --> 02:23:36.967]  Well, Alex, what it seems like here is the latest from the people that I'm talking to on the ground there in Hawaii.
[02:23:37.388 --> 02:23:42.914]  He actually ended up moving back to the mainland in order to pursue this.
[02:23:43.295 --> 02:23:46.539]  This is still information that we're trying to dig out here.
[02:23:49.522 --> 02:24:04.372]  Let's just say a source on the ground there has gotten in contact with a family member and Ryan Routh moved back to the mainland, spent most of his time in the mainland because he was focusing his efforts on trying to recruit U.S.
[02:24:04.432 --> 02:24:07.394]  citizens to move over to Ukraine.
[02:24:08.278 --> 02:24:11.019]  In order to fight on behalf of Ukraine.
[02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:12.500]  He spent time in D.C.
[02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:18.503]  lobbying on behalf of the Ukrainian government and trying to have the U.S.
[02:24:18.543 --> 02:24:19.584]  government actually send U.S.
[02:24:19.604 --> 02:24:20.284]  troops over there.
[02:24:20.624 --> 02:24:30.129]  But the time that he spent in Hawaii recently has been much less than it was before because he came back to the mainland in order to push U.S.
[02:24:30.149 --> 02:24:31.049]  troops into Ukraine.
[02:24:31.489 --> 02:24:32.350]  Well that just confirms the...
[02:24:51.818 --> 02:24:55.480]  New York Times article that he was running around recruiting people, that he was such a wonderful hero.
[02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:56.800]  Nick Sordor, keep digging.
[02:24:56.820 --> 02:24:57.641]  I think we'll talk to you in a moment.
[02:24:58.161 --> 02:24:59.922]  Let's go to more speakers on Spaces.
[02:25:00.422 --> 02:25:01.443]  Chase Geyser, who's up next?
[02:25:01.963 --> 02:25:02.943]  Let's go to Naomi next.
[02:25:03.003 --> 02:25:04.904]  Naomi, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say.
[02:25:04.924 --> 02:25:07.726]  Hi, thanks.
[02:25:07.846 --> 02:25:11.667]  Pleasure to be on the Space, although, well, the situation is quite tragic, actually.
[02:25:12.168 --> 02:25:16.670]  But, well, I just want to point out again, because it was mentioned before, how
[02:25:17.786 --> 02:25:23.192]  How crucial it is that we recognize Trump is unique and he's irreplaceable.
[02:25:23.552 --> 02:25:30.079]  And that's why if something I mean, of course, we don't hope for an attack like this to happen on Kamala Harris either.
[02:25:30.439 --> 02:25:35.164]  But if it happened, she would be easily replaceable, just like Joe Biden was replaceable.
[02:25:35.504 --> 02:25:38.066]  But Trump is completely irreplaceable.
[02:25:38.506 --> 02:25:52.776]  And each time something like this happens, we have to realize that there is nobody else in the Republican Party who could replace Trump simply because he is not only shifting the Overton window towards a more right-wing narrative or something.
[02:25:53.057 --> 02:25:56.199]  No, he's allowing us freedom of the people.
[02:25:56.619 --> 02:26:01.945]  He is the man of the people and that's why he is stepping out of this entire establishment.
[02:26:01.986 --> 02:26:05.450]  That's why he's such a threat to the entire system.
[02:26:06.070 --> 02:26:13.259]  And Kamala Harris came out with a statement apparently saying that she condemns the violence or something like
[02:26:14.639 --> 02:26:16.279]  Violence has no place in America.
[02:26:16.580 --> 02:26:18.380]  Well, isn't that fucking ironic?
[02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:19.140]  Sorry for swearing.
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:22.120]  But she is the one letting in the illegal immigrants.
[02:26:22.521 --> 02:26:29.062]  And we have seen, not just in Europe, but also now in America, to what kind of crime that leads.
[02:26:29.462 --> 02:26:41.804]  And she is also responsible, or maybe not just she herself personally, but her entire campaign is responsible for this destructive messaging against Donald Trump that has been going on for years.
[02:26:41.884 --> 02:26:43.144]  She's just part of this
[02:26:43.604 --> 02:26:44.565]  We're good to go.
[02:27:04.564 --> 02:27:13.372]  A systematic attack on Donald Trump and it's going to keep on going and we can't just wish it away by him becoming the president.
[02:27:13.692 --> 02:27:14.973]  It might even get worse.
[02:27:15.553 --> 02:27:16.875]  Every single day counts.
[02:27:17.075 --> 02:27:21.418]  Every single day there is a threat until he has like maximum security.
[02:27:21.779 --> 02:27:23.160]  So what is the solution now?
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:24.101]  What are we going to do?
[02:27:24.121 --> 02:27:28.124]  He is such a valuable person.
[02:27:28.664 --> 02:27:29.265]  His life
[02:27:30.337 --> 02:27:43.260]  I would like to get your thoughts on that as well.
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:47.121]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[02:27:47.141 --> 02:27:49.061]  And I just go back to the facts.
[02:27:49.761 --> 02:27:50.721]  We know they had to stand down.
[02:27:50.761 --> 02:27:51.722]  We know they lied to Congress.
[02:27:51.762 --> 02:27:53.362]  We know that they're suppressing information.
[02:27:53.382 --> 02:27:54.662]  That's all come out in the Senate last week.
[02:27:54.702 --> 02:27:56.963]  We already knew it back at the time, two months ago.
[02:27:57.023 --> 02:27:58.283]  But now it's all confirmed what we said.
[02:27:59.585 --> 02:28:04.048]  The CIA runs the foreign legions that are sent over to Ukraine.
[02:28:04.068 --> 02:28:04.868]  They run the whole thing.
[02:28:04.928 --> 02:28:12.192]  So a CIA-trained, controlled operative dropped right in where Trump was to kill him at an unannounced golf game.
[02:28:12.933 --> 02:28:13.613]  He had help.
[02:28:14.013 --> 02:28:15.394]  The FBI is running the investigation.
[02:28:15.414 --> 02:28:16.315]  They'll cover it up again.
[02:28:16.995 --> 02:28:17.996]  Eric Prince is totally right.
[02:28:18.016 --> 02:28:19.116]  We'll get that clip ready in a moment.
[02:28:19.497 --> 02:28:22.799]  He was just on with Benny Johnson and said, we've got to have Governor DeSantis take control of this.
[02:28:23.559 --> 02:28:25.620]  This is just absolutely so dangerous.
[02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:29.261]  Chase Geiser, if Harrison Smith's still there, we'll go.
[02:28:29.541 --> 02:28:30.721]  That might actually be a good question here.
[02:28:30.741 --> 02:28:32.082]  We have Jim Paff up here on the stage.
[02:28:32.122 --> 02:28:36.223]  Jim, he's a veteran of Capitol Hill, and I think it is a good question, and a lot of people are asking that.
[02:28:36.303 --> 02:28:38.324]  In that bottom right-hand corner, there's a little purple pill there.
[02:28:38.604 --> 02:28:39.964]  Guys, give your questions, comments, and such.
[02:28:39.984 --> 02:28:42.925]  We'll try to bring them up on the space here.
[02:28:43.165 --> 02:28:49.307]  Jim, so Eric Prince, who is the CEO of Blackwater, a U.S.
[02:28:49.507 --> 02:28:51.088]  military contractor,
[02:28:51.708 --> 02:28:53.029]  And he's also an ex-Navy SEAL.
[02:28:53.310 --> 02:29:03.078]  He brought up that Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida should take control of this investigation down there because the FBI is in charge now.
[02:29:03.338 --> 02:29:06.160]  A lot of people don't trust the FBI at this point.
[02:29:06.180 --> 02:29:07.621]  There's very good reason not to.
[02:29:08.862 --> 02:29:10.304]  What can Governor Ron DeSantis do?
[02:29:10.324 --> 02:29:11.445]  Can he actually do that?
[02:29:11.525 --> 02:29:16.489]  Can he take control of this investigation using state law enforcement down there in Florida?
[02:29:17.230 --> 02:29:19.032]  There's a degree to which he can for sure.
[02:29:19.373 --> 02:29:28.086]  Now, of course, you're talking about a federal candidate in Donald Trump, but he's not presently, you know, a president of the United States.
[02:29:28.607 --> 02:29:31.552]  So there is, I mean, the FBI always
[02:29:32.233 --> 02:29:32.894]  We're good to go.
[02:29:47.586 --> 02:29:56.670]  To be, you know, have equal access to everything that's going on and with the FBI not being able to absolutely control it.
[02:29:56.990 --> 02:30:03.092]  And he's got some of the assets here was local police officers who arrested this potential shooter.
[02:30:03.693 --> 02:30:08.795]  And so, you know, the local authorities and certainly the state as well has an interest.
[02:30:09.515 --> 02:30:12.116]  Absolutely, Ron DeSantis can step in here and do something.
[02:30:12.136 --> 02:30:12.496]  It's absurd.
[02:30:25.021 --> 02:30:37.027]  How we have forgotten so much about the federalist system that we are in, which, you know, is in various levels of government, with no area of government having complete authority over the others.
[02:30:37.107 --> 02:30:42.709]  Local, state, and federal government all, you know, the state and local governments have their authority with it.
[02:30:42.749 --> 02:30:49.692]  But there's one little thing that we got to keep in mind that drives the FBI to want to control it and to hide the information.
[02:30:50.432 --> 02:30:53.474]  The main argument that these
[02:30:54.428 --> 02:30:56.608]  What bureaucrats and D.C.
[02:30:56.668 --> 02:31:03.350]  people have against Donald Trump is that they hate him because he might have executive power.
[02:31:03.390 --> 02:31:23.114]  They have argued against his presidency on the basis that he's going to be a little dictator because he wants to put all control into himself, and that's just going to make him a dictator, which is absurd because the Constitution does give all executive authority to a president of the United States.
[02:31:23.114 --> 02:31:30.007]  Meanwhile, that's what they, the bureaucrats, have already given as themselves a fourth branch above the government that is the deep state.
[02:31:30.973 --> 02:31:40.115]  There's no doubt about it, Alex, and this is the mindset that makes a huge difference in everything that's going on.
[02:31:40.395 --> 02:31:42.355]  These people literally think they're in charge.
[02:31:42.375 --> 02:31:45.716]  I mean, the documents case, for example, is absurd.
[02:31:47.336 --> 02:31:50.317]  You have to follow some procedure if you're president of the United States.
[02:31:50.337 --> 02:31:52.317]  No, bullcrap!
[02:31:52.618 --> 02:31:54.538]  The procedures are the presidents.
[02:31:55.238 --> 02:31:56.259]  Not the other way around.
[02:31:56.679 --> 02:32:07.768]  So that mindset is going to make everything that's going on, not just today, but everything leading up to it, that mindset is really what we're fighting against here.
[02:32:08.108 --> 02:32:10.650]  These people are authoritarian in their outlook.
[02:32:10.930 --> 02:32:21.358]  And just to harken to what we see going on in Brazil, and I'm connected with many of the members of Congress down there, Alan DeSantos and Paulo Figueiredo are friends of mine, this thing going on down there
[02:32:21.958 --> 02:32:24.940]  It's escalating quickly, Jim, and talk about what you see escalating.
[02:32:24.980 --> 02:32:26.241]  And then what about Trump?
[02:32:26.261 --> 02:32:27.222]  You know, he's a great guy.
[02:32:27.722 --> 02:32:29.264]  He has nothing but confidence.
[02:32:47.597 --> 02:32:58.842]  But again, in a war, you don't have your top general parade around where the enemy can shoot him, or a top scientist, or like the top brain, and the symbol we need, and the guy that'll do what he says he's gonna do.
[02:32:59.443 --> 02:33:00.743]  I mean, come on, people!
[02:33:00.783 --> 02:33:10.608]  I mean, I said last Friday, I said Friday, I said they're gonna try to kill him, I'm totally pissed he's parading around, and it's still going on, he's still gonna do it, and there's, and look, you know, God's got his hand on him, but
[02:33:10.868 --> 02:33:13.711]  But God also wants people to take care of themselves and use their brain.
[02:33:14.111 --> 02:33:17.134]  And I see Eric Trump and others are freaking out about this and are really concerned.
[02:33:17.495 --> 02:33:18.916]  Trump has got to stop it.
[02:33:18.956 --> 02:33:21.859]  He's got to know they're sending more assassins.
[02:33:21.879 --> 02:33:22.720]  I mean, holy Toledo.
[02:33:24.241 --> 02:33:28.225]  You have to have thoughtful caution in situations like this.
[02:33:28.285 --> 02:33:33.711]  But Alex, I also look to some of the great generals in American history who found themselves
[02:33:34.508 --> 02:33:45.491]  Yeah, Washington, Patton, you can name, there are dozens of them in the Civil War that made the Union have that victory because you had people who get right into it.
[02:33:46.131 --> 02:33:52.633]  So there's a sense in which you want that, but certainly there needs to be great precaution in this situation.
[02:33:52.893 --> 02:34:01.516]  But I'll say this, what I believe can come out, and I don't know how to wrap my head around the Ukraine theory, but obviously everything that you're saying has
[02:34:03.027 --> 02:34:03.908]  Tremendous relevance.
[02:34:03.948 --> 02:34:05.109]  Well, let me explain it.
[02:34:05.129 --> 02:34:06.650]  $200 billion into a black hole.
[02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:09.913]  The CIA trains and radicalizes leftists.
[02:34:10.333 --> 02:34:11.894]  They send them over there for combat.
[02:34:11.955 --> 02:34:15.537]  Then they're sent back here trained to carry out assassinations and other dirty work.
[02:34:15.818 --> 02:34:17.639]  Jack Posobiec predicted it months ago on the show.
[02:34:18.620 --> 02:34:21.282]  And there are billions of dollars more at stake here.
[02:34:21.763 --> 02:34:27.908]  And so while you look at that situation as we try to put that together for this guy, we better recognize
[02:34:28.547 --> 02:34:30.468]  That these people are serious.
[02:34:30.888 --> 02:34:45.152]  They're serious about taking down a man who, I believe, directly with you, the polls are totally wrong, a man who's likely to become president again, highly likely to become president again, and everything's a threat.
[02:34:45.473 --> 02:34:48.454]  And they're the ones backed in the corner, not Donald Trump.
[02:34:48.814 --> 02:34:53.555]  So when you see a rabid dog backed in a corner, you better be careful.
[02:34:53.575 --> 02:34:55.636]  You better know what you're doing and you better take it out.
[02:34:56.076 --> 02:34:57.597]  Because it's going to come and harm you.
[02:34:58.278 --> 02:35:00.860]  That's the attitude that we're going to see coming here.
[02:35:00.940 --> 02:35:01.741]  It's the attitude.
[02:35:01.881 --> 02:35:21.819]  And this is why, by the way, these idiots, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney and all these other people who everyone thought were conservative heroes, we find out that no, they really are deep state neocons who wanted to control things for the benefit of their cronies.
[02:35:22.649 --> 02:35:28.674]  And that is a serious issue because it's not just their friendships and connections, it's money.
[02:35:29.014 --> 02:35:30.375]  It's a huge amount of money.
[02:35:30.755 --> 02:35:34.538]  And these people are determined to utilize federal power.
[02:35:35.228 --> 02:35:37.270]  Let's go to Heather next.
[02:35:37.330 --> 02:35:39.032]  Heather, you've been waiting patiently.
[02:35:39.092 --> 02:35:41.835]  Go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say.
[02:36:02.344 --> 02:36:03.545]  Thank you guys.
[02:36:03.785 --> 02:36:10.232]  There was one thing that I wanted to comment on before I talked about my question that I have.
[02:36:10.832 --> 02:36:21.462]  The one is, I hear a lot of people saying that Trump needs to maybe roll back his schedule a little bit, his appearances, which I 100% understand.
[02:36:22.043 --> 02:36:27.348]  The other thing that I want to point out to people, and perhaps the colonel that spoke earlier can, you know,
[02:36:28.698 --> 02:36:29.999]  Chime in on this token.
[02:36:30.439 --> 02:36:31.440]  I myself am a veteran.
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:35.563]  I served for 15 years in the Air Force, multiple deployments, both to Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:36:36.464 --> 02:36:49.694]  These types of situations, within the first 24 to 48 hours, the person is going to experience a myriad of emotions and a myriad of various different components for what they just went through.
[02:36:49.914 --> 02:36:52.916]  This was a very, you know, for the average person, I get it.
[02:36:52.956 --> 02:36:53.657]  We love Trump.
[02:36:53.677 --> 02:36:55.338]  Trump is a strong human, but
[02:36:56.252 --> 02:37:15.855]  They are trying to take the strong human out who also has been dehumanized and as a human going through these types of experiences and these types of traumatic events he is going to need to be given a little bit of grace to to go different ways should he choose because
[02:37:16.576 --> 02:37:21.038]  When you are in those situations, it is hard to think on a straight line.
[02:37:21.499 --> 02:37:36.646]  And so I think that over the course of the next probably 24 to 48 hours a week, we're going to see some changes happening, probably that are going to be contrary to what was said today from the Trump campaign in terms of his events.
[02:37:37.187 --> 02:37:39.228]  So I think some grace is needed.
[02:37:40.166 --> 02:37:48.160]  In terms of how they choose to go forward, remembering that Trump is a human, that in the last two months has had two attempts on his life.
[02:37:49.353 --> 02:37:51.154]  Well the point is, let me just say something real quick.
[02:37:53.115 --> 02:37:53.415]  J.D.
[02:37:53.455 --> 02:37:54.535]  Vance is on CNN.
[02:37:54.615 --> 02:37:58.097]  Trump still goes on CBS and stuff like it's the big audience.
[02:37:58.257 --> 02:38:00.058]  And maybe some undecided people there, but probably not.
[02:38:00.678 --> 02:38:02.099]  Hardly anybody watches that now.
[02:38:02.119 --> 02:38:02.559]  I have the numbers.
[02:38:02.579 --> 02:38:04.120]  He had a billion with Elon Musk.
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:05.340]  That was a month ago.
[02:38:05.500 --> 02:38:06.521]  Do it every week.
[02:38:07.401 --> 02:38:08.321]  Do roundtables.
[02:38:08.361 --> 02:38:09.802]  Do it with, go do Joe Rogan.
[02:38:09.882 --> 02:38:13.504]  I mean, he doesn't, and look, rallies are great.
[02:38:14.298 --> 02:38:23.560]  But no, digitally, Trump is just now figuring out that the internet, even mainstream news, this is like 80% of news is now just people online.
[02:38:23.620 --> 02:38:26.781]  People don't get their news from that unless they're like 80 years old anymore.
[02:38:27.121 --> 02:38:28.082]  Nothing against old folks.
[02:38:28.142 --> 02:38:34.203]  So it's not even good strategy to continue to parade around, do a few events.
[02:38:35.503 --> 02:38:37.384]  Now we learned this was an unannounced golf deal.
[02:38:38.324 --> 02:38:39.144]  The shooter was there.
[02:38:39.164 --> 02:38:41.105]  And again, I'm gonna say it again.
[02:38:42.495 --> 02:38:46.996]  They've got killers all over the place trying to kill him, okay?
[02:38:47.676 --> 02:38:52.897]  The fact that they failed twice now, they're gonna shoot his plane down or something and say the Iranians did it.
[02:38:52.917 --> 02:38:55.857]  Everybody's gonna go, God, Alex Jones was right again.
[02:38:56.338 --> 02:39:00.278]  When they do that, they're gonna cut the internet off, blow up a bunch of stuff and say Trump supporters did it.
[02:39:00.698 --> 02:39:05.979]  When they kill Trump, they're gonna do a bunch of false flags and put on the internet kill switch, okay?
[02:39:06.639 --> 02:39:09.360]  And life as you know it is over and then we go into the real thing.
[02:39:10.256 --> 02:39:11.917]  I mean, I've got urgency.
[02:39:11.977 --> 02:39:17.580]  I'm physically disgusted right now because I don't think people realize, even hardcore folks think they're hardcore.
[02:39:17.860 --> 02:39:19.381]  This is not some game show.
[02:39:19.821 --> 02:39:20.962]  This is not entertainment.
[02:39:21.422 --> 02:39:23.924]  Trump likes some shooting gallery and it's so exciting.
[02:39:23.964 --> 02:39:25.044]  Will he get killed tomorrow?
[02:39:25.525 --> 02:39:27.966]  Is what that existentially means.
[02:39:28.446 --> 02:39:29.427]  I said at the start of the show,
[02:39:29.887 --> 02:39:36.170]  This is connected to them getting ready to go to full war with Russia, and two hours later it came out the guy's sheep-dipped CIA U.S.
[02:39:36.190 --> 02:39:37.071]  fighter out of Ukraine.
[02:39:37.471 --> 02:39:37.791]  Okay?
[02:39:38.011 --> 02:39:39.712]  I mean, this is the deep state.
[02:39:40.112 --> 02:39:42.153]  And so was Crooks, and all of it.
[02:39:42.253 --> 02:39:46.195]  And look, it'd be one thing if it was a deep state just wanting to run things.
[02:39:46.235 --> 02:39:49.357]  They don't want to just run things, they want to cut our sons' genitals off and our daughters' breasts off.
[02:39:49.577 --> 02:39:50.497]  They want war with Russia.
[02:39:50.757 --> 02:39:51.938]  They are demons.
[02:39:52.378 --> 02:39:53.639]  Sorry, ma'am, go ahead and finish your points.
[02:39:56.044 --> 02:39:58.567]  No, Alex, I agree with everything you're saying.
[02:39:58.627 --> 02:40:15.724]  And then my other, you know, unfortunately there is this push within the press and I think that this statistic is alarmingly low because it has come out that it's 85%, the last stat that I read, that the mainstream media is, they say left-leaning, but I'd say they're all in on the left.
[02:40:16.668 --> 02:40:28.916]  And it's the rhetoric that is coming from the top, the pioneers, the purveyors of propaganda in the Biden and Harris administration, and it's being filtered out through the press who are not tackling these issues.
[02:40:28.976 --> 02:40:39.102]  The fact that it has been left alone for the American public and nobody is being held accountable for the first assassination attempt without a motive.
[02:40:39.423 --> 02:40:42.985]  When do people wake up and cut out this
[02:40:44.005 --> 02:40:48.830]  Propagandic mainstream media that is corrupting the minds of these people.
[02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:57.237]  I mean, you can't say that the Biden-Harris and the press and the media don't have blood on their hands when it comes to this for continuing to put out these lies.
[02:40:57.477 --> 02:41:00.700]  And Biden still blocking full secret server protection for Trump.
[02:41:00.740 --> 02:41:01.401]  Thank you so much.
[02:41:01.421 --> 02:41:01.901]  Great points.
[02:41:02.442 --> 02:41:04.223]  I see Edward Dowd, who's super smart.
[02:41:04.944 --> 02:41:08.526]  And it really exposed the actuary numbers and got the whistleblowers to go public.
[02:41:08.546 --> 02:41:11.908]  Some of the top actuaries in the world on the mass death from the poison shots.
[02:41:11.948 --> 02:41:13.028]  I see him in the listeners.
[02:41:13.609 --> 02:41:14.269]  So he's listening.
[02:41:14.309 --> 02:41:19.072]  I know he's listening, but Edward, make yourself raise your hand because we want to go to you in a moment.
[02:41:20.392 --> 02:41:22.594]  I want to go back to Harrison Smith, too, who's waiting there.
[02:41:22.614 --> 02:41:25.155]  So he needs to be a speaker as well.
[02:41:25.595 --> 02:41:30.638]  But while Harrison and Edward Dowd are getting queued up, let's go back to real quick.
[02:41:30.898 --> 02:41:32.079]  Nick Sorter, who I know is
[02:41:32.879 --> 02:41:35.701]  Really doing a great job beavering away, getting new intel.
[02:41:36.021 --> 02:41:38.062]  Since we talked to you 15 minutes ago, anything new, Nick?
[02:41:39.263 --> 02:41:58.514]  Well, I mean, kind of going back to what you were talking about before, about how the White House tried to, you know, these secret sources or whatever CNN is citing, after the first Trump assassination, it came out, or assassination attempt, it came out that said, oh, well, we briefed the Trump campaign saying that
[02:41:59.494 --> 02:42:03.375]  That Iran was going to increase their efforts to attack President Trump.
[02:42:03.736 --> 02:42:08.397]  That came out almost immediately after the first Trump assassination attempt.
[02:42:08.457 --> 02:42:13.479]  And lo and behold, what comes out again right after this Trump assassination attempt?
[02:42:13.779 --> 02:42:15.799]  You have the exact same thing.
[02:42:15.819 --> 02:42:24.222]  CNN sources coming out saying that Iran was going to, again, increase their efforts to attack President Trump.
[02:42:24.442 --> 02:42:25.743]  That's from CNN citing Intel.
[02:42:27.203 --> 02:42:28.884]  All right, Nick, stay there.
[02:42:28.904 --> 02:42:29.404]  Stay there.
[02:42:29.444 --> 02:42:31.645]  We're on hundreds of radio stations.
[02:42:31.725 --> 02:42:35.527]  I've been skipping all the breaks for the end of hour breaks.
[02:42:35.547 --> 02:42:36.587]  We cannot skip for the radio stations.
[02:42:36.607 --> 02:42:39.529]  So we'll be back in two minutes with the fourth hour.
[02:42:50.990 --> 02:42:52.851]  And we've just got all these great people on here with us.
[02:42:53.071 --> 02:42:54.332]  This is so dangerous.
[02:42:54.352 --> 02:42:55.353]  They're going to try again.
[02:42:56.093 --> 02:42:57.334]  They're starting World War III.
[02:42:57.634 --> 02:42:59.496]  It's just unspeakably insane.
[02:43:00.016 --> 02:43:02.298]  But again, the average American doesn't even think about Russia existing.
[02:43:02.318 --> 02:43:03.138]  It's like another planet.
[02:43:03.578 --> 02:43:04.959]  No, it's only a few minutes away.
[02:43:12.919 --> 02:43:24.585]  All right folks, we are back into hour number four right now, and we're simulcasting on Spaces on X, and Nick Sordor got cut off by that network break.
[02:43:25.245 --> 02:43:26.586]  So Nick, finish the point you were making.
[02:43:27.972 --> 02:43:49.674]  Well, the point that I was making is that these intelligence sources, quote-unquote, that CNN has, are saying exactly the same thing that they said the first time they made an attempt on Trump's life, where they come out and they say, oh, well, we briefed the Trump campaign about these incoming attacks from Iran, and then
[02:43:50.694 --> 02:44:01.503]  You know, and then apparently right after they did those briefings, then Trump got shot for the first time, and they still did not increase his security to the point of the President of the United States.
[02:44:01.603 --> 02:44:08.689]  Obviously, President Trump's a much bigger target than Joe Biden at this point because he's just a corpse that's walking around, doesn't actually have any power, he's not running anything at this point.
[02:44:08.929 --> 02:44:10.570]  But again, same excuse.
[02:44:10.850 --> 02:44:19.137]  Now CNN reporting that they warned the Trump campaign that there was going to be more attempts by Iran to take him out
[02:44:19.737 --> 02:44:25.845]  That's what CNN is saying, although the Secret Service would still not give them more resources.
[02:44:25.865 --> 02:44:30.732]  I don't know what they're supposed to do with that information, even if what the intelligence community was telling them was true.
[02:44:31.702 --> 02:44:32.783]  I don't understand.
[02:44:33.303 --> 02:44:34.024]  What is the point?
[02:44:34.364 --> 02:44:36.125]  What is their goal at this point, Alex?
[02:44:36.165 --> 02:44:42.770]  Are they just trying to... Are they releasing this information now just so that, you know, they can sort of preface this for a war with Iran?
[02:44:43.330 --> 02:44:45.011]  I mean, is that what we're getting to at this point?
[02:44:45.471 --> 02:44:51.956]  Well, they have already put out reports in the news saying Iran's being investigated.
[02:44:52.016 --> 02:44:52.476]  It never ends.
[02:44:52.496 --> 02:44:53.177]  He's a U.S.
[02:44:54.380 --> 02:44:55.160]  Foreign Legion.
[02:44:55.261 --> 02:44:56.541]  CIA runs all that.
[02:44:56.821 --> 02:44:58.322]  Operative that's come back to the United States.
[02:44:58.342 --> 02:45:00.544]  He was out recruiting people for the Foreign Legion.
[02:45:00.584 --> 02:45:01.384]  He hated Trump.
[02:45:01.744 --> 02:45:02.645]  We have his Facebook.
[02:45:02.665 --> 02:45:03.185]  They've removed it.
[02:45:03.205 --> 02:45:03.966]  We have copies of it.
[02:45:03.986 --> 02:45:04.966]  He hated Trump's guts.
[02:45:05.887 --> 02:45:08.828]  And he was threatening a lot of other Republicans or saying he was going to do stuff.
[02:45:09.389 --> 02:45:10.169]  And here we go.
[02:45:10.229 --> 02:45:12.631]  The usual suspects are running around saying that's not true.
[02:45:13.071 --> 02:45:17.413]  It's like they say, there's no Haitians engaged in any crime in Springfield, Ohio.
[02:45:18.174 --> 02:45:19.074]  Let's go ahead now.
[02:45:19.254 --> 02:45:21.636]  And who's up next here, Chase Geyser?
[02:45:22.316 --> 02:45:26.138]  All right, Edward Dowd, you should be able to tap the mute button in the lower left and unmute yourself.
[02:45:26.199 --> 02:45:29.521]  If you're still available to speak, please go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say.
[02:45:29.541 --> 02:45:37.285]  All right, looks like he's having trouble, so in the meantime, let's go on to World Life.
[02:45:37.305 --> 02:45:38.246]  World Life, you've been waiting.
[02:45:38.766 --> 02:45:40.487]  Go ahead and unmute yourself and say... Oh, there's Edward.
[02:45:40.507 --> 02:45:40.988]  There's Edward.
[02:45:41.028 --> 02:45:41.368]  There he is.
[02:45:41.468 --> 02:45:42.329]  Okay, Edward, we got you.
[02:45:44.170 --> 02:45:45.190]  Can you guys hear me?
[02:45:45.991 --> 02:45:47.432]  Yeah, sounds like you're in a windstorm.
[02:45:49.249 --> 02:45:53.752]  Yeah, I'm out for a walk, so I'll be brief, um, if you can hear me well.
[02:45:53.952 --> 02:45:54.413]  Yeah, we can hear you.
[02:45:54.433 --> 02:46:00.777]  Bottom line, why, bottom line, Alex is, uh, you nailed it early on.
[02:46:01.177 --> 02:46:04.439]  The questions of logistics and timing suggest he had help.
[02:46:04.860 --> 02:46:06.501]  There's no way he knew about this event.
[02:46:06.941 --> 02:46:15.667]  The timing, uh, the tee time, the golf hole he was on, uh, and where to, where to, where to, uh, pop in on the hedgerows.
[02:46:15.687 --> 02:46:16.868]  So he had help.
[02:46:17.428 --> 02:46:18.429]  It's an inside job.
[02:46:19.318 --> 02:46:22.740]  What do you think Trump should do, Edward?
[02:46:39.461 --> 02:46:39.901]  I'm with you.
[02:46:39.941 --> 02:46:40.842]  You should go to the bunker.
[02:46:41.142 --> 02:46:42.863]  It's over.
[02:46:42.883 --> 02:46:48.887]  These rallies, while great, and he loves them and they give him a lot of energy, he's speaking to the crowd.
[02:46:48.947 --> 02:46:54.930]  It's now time to convince the marginal mind, reach people digitally, and invite people to find out where he is.
[02:46:54.990 --> 02:47:01.294]  And he can reach millions more doing what you said, getting on spaces with Elon and yourself.
[02:47:01.354 --> 02:47:02.594]  That's my personal opinion.
[02:47:02.915 --> 02:47:03.315]  The bunker,
[02:47:04.105 --> 02:47:05.547]  Mentality has to be set.
[02:47:05.607 --> 02:47:09.211]  You can't be running around doing events, unfortunately.
[02:47:10.752 --> 02:47:13.035]  How desperate do you think the deep state is now they failed again?
[02:47:13.055 --> 02:47:19.202]  Well, first of all, you know, this Friday we learned what you talked about.
[02:47:19.262 --> 02:47:21.164]  I saw you highlight it Friday morning.
[02:47:21.184 --> 02:47:24.908]  The missiles, the cruise missiles going into the heart of Russia.
[02:47:25.808 --> 02:47:29.470]  That, to me, says they need to do something before the election.
[02:47:30.630 --> 02:47:43.357]  The financial situation, when I pull back $30,000, is that at the point where they're desperate to have an excuse to pull the plug on the system and have a system reset?
[02:47:44.398 --> 02:47:52.067]  And additionally, I have a war expert that I'm in correspondence with, and he said watch for the second evacuation of Kiev.
[02:47:53.469 --> 02:47:56.092]  If that happens, the bombs will start dropping.
[02:47:56.413 --> 02:48:00.258]  So if we start hearing of an evacuation of Kiev, be careful.
[02:48:03.112 --> 02:48:03.392]  Wow.
[02:48:03.452 --> 02:48:04.112]  All right, Edward.
[02:48:04.192 --> 02:48:04.973]  Thank you so much.
[02:48:05.013 --> 02:48:05.853]  Talk to you again soon.
[02:48:05.893 --> 02:48:06.533]  Excellent points.
[02:48:07.254 --> 02:48:11.135]  All right, let's go back to Harrison Smith, and then we'll go to the other speakers and co-host Harrison Smith.
[02:48:11.155 --> 02:48:15.717]  By the way, congratulations to the listeners, because Harrison's always done a great show.
[02:48:15.757 --> 02:48:16.317]  So does Owen.
[02:48:16.337 --> 02:48:16.997]  So does Chase.
[02:48:18.398 --> 02:48:22.399]  It's not just my show exploding on X and everywhere on radio stations.
[02:48:23.300 --> 02:48:30.903]  Harrison has been clocking just on his show on X alone about 4 million viewers a day, and we had 40 plus million
[02:48:32.105 --> 02:48:41.987]  Friday, on the network feed, Harrison Smith, Owen Schroer, and myself, not to mention our other feeds, over 40 million total.
[02:48:43.468 --> 02:48:44.228]  That's not about me.
[02:48:44.808 --> 02:48:45.808]  And look, our enemies know that.
[02:48:45.828 --> 02:48:47.189]  I don't even want to talk about our big race.
[02:48:47.229 --> 02:48:48.129]  That makes them come after us more.
[02:48:48.149 --> 02:48:49.929]  But they've got such a problem now.
[02:48:49.949 --> 02:48:53.930]  I'm seeing Roger Stone with his show with two or three million viewers a day.
[02:48:54.050 --> 02:48:54.410]  I love it.
[02:48:54.810 --> 02:48:56.071]  Jack Masobik, tens of millions.
[02:48:56.131 --> 02:48:57.091]  I could just listen for hours.
[02:48:57.151 --> 02:48:57.771]  I mean, there's so many.
[02:48:58.491 --> 02:48:59.812]  Benny Johnson, on and on.
[02:49:03.931 --> 02:49:05.452]  Elon Musk with hundreds of millions a day.
[02:49:07.713 --> 02:49:17.598]  There was stuff going on at X and Elon is... I feel like bowling balls while I'm in a swimming race, but I had two bowling balls tied to my feet still on X. Bowling balls are gone, folks.
[02:49:18.518 --> 02:49:20.640]  A lot of that is you sharing the links, but something else is going on.
[02:49:20.740 --> 02:49:22.080]  Elon is full in.
[02:49:22.641 --> 02:49:23.221]  Harrison Smith?
[02:49:24.958 --> 02:49:27.059]  Yeah, thanks, Alex, and thank God for Elon Musk.
[02:49:27.079 --> 02:49:29.320]  And also, you know, it's not just us.
[02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:33.462]  So many people now sound like Infowars because finally the message is broken through.
[02:49:33.902 --> 02:49:48.890]  And just to, you know, do like Infowars does and take it that next step further, I think you were right on the money early on when you were talking about ammonium nitrate and how dangerous some of the attacks could be, just planting a bomb or running a truck through the barriers.
[02:49:48.930 --> 02:49:50.971]  I mean, Trump is not going to be safe.
[02:49:51.651 --> 02:49:53.992]  And I don't know if you saw the story yesterday.
[02:49:54.052 --> 02:49:57.093]  They were talking about Russia threatening to cut the underwater cables.
[02:49:57.113 --> 02:50:01.115]  And now I don't actually know if Russia would do that or if that'd be an inside job sort of thing.
[02:50:01.135 --> 02:50:03.816]  But that gives them the cyber disruption before the election.
[02:50:03.836 --> 02:50:04.016]  Yeah.
[02:50:04.036 --> 02:50:05.817]  100 percent.
[02:50:05.917 --> 02:50:10.738]  And it would be directly after the assassination of Trump or during, you know, whatever reign of terror followed after that.
[02:50:11.099 --> 02:50:19.862]  So I think it's important that people have plans with their friends and family and just say, hey, if everything goes down, we're going to meet at dad's ranch, you know, and just
[02:50:20.382 --> 02:50:20.902]  We're good to go.
[02:50:45.811 --> 02:50:53.275]  Of this struggle going on between the deep state and our elected representatives where they are denying Congress the power of oversight.
[02:50:53.515 --> 02:50:56.537]  They're usurping the authority of Congress in a number of different areas.
[02:50:57.457 --> 02:50:59.538]  And this is like, this is the death of democracy.
[02:50:59.558 --> 02:51:05.521]  I mean, as much as you want to talk about it, the death of our ability as citizens to have a say in our government, that's what's coming.
[02:51:05.601 --> 02:51:14.066]  If we allow the DHS, the DOJ, who's going after Trump, you know, with everything they've got in a totally corrupt way, if they're able to get away with this,
[02:51:14.767 --> 02:51:17.269]  That's it for elected representation.
[02:51:17.349 --> 02:51:25.279]  They're trying to get rid of our ability to have anybody we elect have any oversight or any say or any influence or any power in the American government.
[02:51:25.319 --> 02:51:34.029]  So we have to, you know, recognize this and call on the Congress, even if just for their own power and their own aggrandizement, they need to treat this seriously.
[02:51:34.649 --> 02:51:41.953]  And fight back against what's happening here, because it's a total usurpation, it's a total destruction of our system if we allow them to get away with this.
[02:51:42.333 --> 02:51:49.177]  And at a certain point, malice and inability are one and the same.
[02:51:49.237 --> 02:51:51.398]  There is no difference, there's no meaningful difference.
[02:51:51.718 --> 02:51:52.998]  Between incompetence and malice.
[02:51:53.038 --> 02:51:54.839]  So we have to treat this for what it is.
[02:51:56.079 --> 02:51:57.220]  What's he saying?
[02:51:57.300 --> 02:51:59.300]  Twice is a coincidence, three times is enemy action?
[02:51:59.741 --> 02:52:08.023]  Well, this is two assassination attempts and I think we can assume enemy action at this point since, I mean, clearly they're gunning for Trump.
[02:52:08.763 --> 02:52:10.704]  No pun intended, but with everything they've got.
[02:52:12.210 --> 02:52:12.630]  Absolutely.
[02:52:12.650 --> 02:52:15.313]  And there's Friday's show, 33.9 million.
[02:52:15.333 --> 02:52:16.554]  That's just one of five feeds.
[02:52:16.654 --> 02:52:19.236]  Over 42 million views on Friday's show.
[02:52:19.256 --> 02:52:20.918]  Congratulations, everybody, in the info war.
[02:52:20.938 --> 02:52:22.459]  That means the listeners sharing the links.
[02:52:22.479 --> 02:52:24.060]  You are kicking New World Order ass.
[02:52:24.621 --> 02:52:25.802]  That is devastating.
[02:52:25.902 --> 02:52:32.327]  Everywhere I was on the hike and bike trail, I hiked seven miles this morning with my oldest daughter and a security guy, great guy.
[02:52:35.698 --> 02:52:37.820]  And every other person was a lister.
[02:52:37.860 --> 02:52:39.661]  Black, white, Hispanic, Chinese, old, young.
[02:52:39.681 --> 02:52:40.562]  It was just, it was insane.
[02:52:42.083 --> 02:52:43.705]  Nick Sordor's got some breaking news, Nick.
[02:52:45.031 --> 02:52:52.913]  Well, I mean, not necessarily breaking news, but I've been going through the audience questions here, and a lot of people are concerned at this point.
[02:52:53.013 --> 02:53:01.875]  Alex, we've seen now two assassination attempts on President Trump in two months, and a lot of people didn't trust the Secret Service for good reason after the first time.
[02:53:02.236 --> 02:53:11.538]  They're definitely not going to trust them much now, because this guy was able to get within shooting range, 300 to 500 yards, with a scoped rifle of President Trump on an open
[02:53:11.698 --> 02:53:13.919]  How do we make sure Trump is protected?
[02:53:41.517 --> 02:53:43.178]  Yeah, that is a great, great point.
[02:53:43.418 --> 02:53:50.423]  And again, this guy reportedly had backpacks, gun, and GoPro wanting to get, you know, battle footage of his big kill.
[02:53:50.804 --> 02:53:54.506]  But the Secret Service opened fire on him instantly when he popped up.
[02:53:54.526 --> 02:53:57.688]  So again, the local guys, the ones assigned to Trump are there to guard him.
[02:53:57.708 --> 02:53:58.469]  They're getting shot at too.
[02:53:58.489 --> 02:53:58.929]  They're good men.
[02:53:58.949 --> 02:53:59.350]  They're heroes.
[02:54:01.691 --> 02:54:07.936]  Uh, and, uh, he even had, like, fake security women that weren't even Secret Service, the one that couldn't holster a gun, because he didn't have Secret Service.
[02:54:07.956 --> 02:54:09.237]  He tried to make it look like he did.
[02:54:09.257 --> 02:54:13.220]  He only had, like, six or seven, reportedly, in Butler, uh, because they ordered a stand-down.
[02:54:13.581 --> 02:54:17.284]  Now he's got a little bit more, but, but, you know, at least they opened fire on this piece of filth.
[02:54:18.024 --> 02:54:19.204]  Uh, this total libtard.
[02:54:19.384 --> 02:54:20.205]  And what's gonna happen to him?
[02:54:20.645 --> 02:54:22.265]  You know, they already cremated the body of Crooks.
[02:54:22.325 --> 02:54:25.306]  Wonder how fast this guy'll die like Epstein in his jail cell.
[02:54:25.826 --> 02:54:29.147]  Uh, let's, uh, let's, let's... You know, the audience is asking me that?
[02:54:29.207 --> 02:54:29.907]  They want my take?
[02:54:29.927 --> 02:54:32.268]  I mean, I pretty much said what I think.
[02:54:32.288 --> 02:54:33.928]  They're gonna try again and again and again.
[02:54:33.948 --> 02:54:35.849]  They're trying to start World War III right now.
[02:54:35.929 --> 02:54:38.910]  I mean, look, there's never been a time in human history this dangerous, okay?
[02:54:39.210 --> 02:54:41.030]  Hands down, all the analysts agree.
[02:54:41.410 --> 02:54:43.211]  I don't even have words to describe how insane this is.
[02:54:44.386 --> 02:54:48.607]  And again, I told family two weeks ago that wanted to go on some Caribbean trip.
[02:54:48.687 --> 02:54:49.567]  Oh, it's inexpensive.
[02:54:49.587 --> 02:54:50.627]  We deserve a week off.
[02:54:50.707 --> 02:54:52.968]  Come on, let's just go on a weekend, a long weekend.
[02:54:54.068 --> 02:54:55.629]  And I said, when there can be a nuclear war?
[02:54:56.329 --> 02:54:57.429]  When they can try to kill Trump?
[02:54:57.449 --> 02:55:04.551]  Do you understand that the minute they kill Trump, they're going to hit the internet kill switch and blow a bunch of crap up and blame it on Trump supporters and we're off to the races.
[02:55:05.091 --> 02:55:07.611]  They got top Democrats saying they're going to stage a civil war, people!
[02:55:09.032 --> 02:55:10.492]  And my own family gets irritated with me.
[02:55:11.514 --> 02:55:12.915]  Oh, you're just doom and gloom.
[02:55:12.955 --> 02:55:13.756]  The hell I am!
[02:55:13.776 --> 02:55:17.158]  You think I've been doing this 30 years, sitting there with my thumb up my ass?
[02:55:17.178 --> 02:55:19.941]  You think I don't know what I'm... I don't tell you anything I don't believe.
[02:55:20.241 --> 02:55:24.504]  Now, I'm wrong sometimes, but the audience doesn't need me to tell you how much trouble we're in.
[02:55:24.824 --> 02:55:36.253]  We better be praying, we better be speaking out, and all the crazy people, the lawyers that run everything now, most have never been in the military, never been in a real fistfight, never had a problem, now they want to go start a fight with Russia.
[02:55:36.413 --> 02:55:38.255]  This isn't like the Arabs who don't have nuclear weapons.
[02:55:40.273 --> 02:55:44.015]  Okay, I mean, this is crazy town behavior.
[02:55:45.643 --> 02:55:48.125]  Oh, let's start a fight with the Russians, the biggest nuclear power in the world.
[02:55:48.505 --> 02:55:54.169]  The biggest thing, I mean, it is, it's like somebody saying let's start firing cruise missiles at the United States.
[02:55:54.229 --> 02:55:55.129]  It's just as dumb.
[02:55:55.650 --> 02:55:57.691]  It is, it's Satanism.
[02:55:57.991 --> 02:56:04.835]  The people running things are Satanist, and they're trying to get our military and our government, everybody in line for World War frickin' Three.
[02:56:05.176 --> 02:56:06.977]  I'll say it, World War fuckin' Three.
[02:56:06.997 --> 02:56:08.038]  Are you ready for that, folks?
[02:56:08.758 --> 02:56:11.620]  That's the real question, because I said it before the show started.
[02:56:13.177 --> 02:56:17.918]  I posted on X, this is all about them announcing the bombardment of Russia with storm shadow missiles.
[02:56:18.139 --> 02:56:19.939]  They gotta get Trump out of the way before World War III.
[02:56:20.179 --> 02:56:26.821]  And then it comes out he's Ukrainian, US, Foreign Legion, CIA-run piece of filth.
[02:56:27.281 --> 02:56:30.502]  I mean, my God, people, it doesn't get any more obvious than that.
[02:56:30.842 --> 02:56:32.323]  Dropped in right where Trump was.
[02:56:32.363 --> 02:56:35.084]  I mean, this is not 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[02:56:35.764 --> 02:56:37.244]  This is, what's that in the sun at noon?
[02:56:37.324 --> 02:56:37.965]  It's the sun.
[02:56:38.785 --> 02:56:41.106]  You know, what's that up in the sky at night?
[02:56:41.146 --> 02:56:41.806]  That's the moon.
[02:56:42.961 --> 02:56:44.322]  You know, what color shirt am I wearing?
[02:56:44.382 --> 02:56:44.802]  Black.
[02:56:46.003 --> 02:56:46.623]  What's behind me?
[02:56:46.663 --> 02:56:47.524]  The Texas Capitol.
[02:56:48.164 --> 02:56:52.107]  I mean, it's just, it's 100% crazy people.
[02:56:53.308 --> 02:56:55.669]  I mean, Hitler starts losing World War II in North Africa.
[02:56:57.331 --> 02:57:00.312]  And so he says, I'll just attack Russia with operate.
[02:57:00.353 --> 02:57:01.493]  Oh, that's a wonderful idea.
[02:57:02.174 --> 02:57:03.334]  And it's the same crap.
[02:57:05.116 --> 02:57:06.116]  Hitler was like, I'll do it.
[02:57:06.156 --> 02:57:08.218]  Napoleon never did behind the scenes.
[02:57:08.238 --> 02:57:09.859]  Yeah, that's really a great idea.
[02:57:11.832 --> 02:57:13.953]  It's megalomaniac behavior.
[02:57:17.435 --> 02:57:18.736]  Chase, who should we go to next?
[02:57:19.716 --> 02:57:21.738]  Next up, let's go to Chief Trumpster.
[02:57:21.798 --> 02:57:23.999]  Chief Trumpster, go ahead and unmute yourself and share what you have to say.
[02:57:25.500 --> 02:57:27.361]  Yeah, I'll just say a couple points.
[02:57:27.381 --> 02:57:29.542]  When the left calls Trump an enemy to democracy,
[02:57:34.248 --> 02:57:38.495]  The Trumps sure are talking about how Trump's ending democracy and how actions have to be taken.
[02:57:38.515 --> 02:57:40.498]  And actions taken, people are surprised.
[02:57:40.518 --> 02:57:41.800]  The reality is, like, the West has been
[02:57:45.430 --> 02:57:45.851]  I don't know.
[02:58:05.666 --> 02:58:06.306]  Okay, cool.
[02:58:26.749 --> 02:58:26.929]  I don't
[02:58:46.988 --> 02:58:48.629]  Alright, thank you so much, great points.
[02:58:48.649 --> 02:58:52.311]  We just got a new video, we're downloading it now.
[02:58:52.351 --> 02:58:59.074]  This guy was so prolific, he was in the New York Times, a bunch of other papers recruiting people for war, going over to war.
[02:59:15.211 --> 02:59:28.059]  And now, the reported assassin, Wesley Roth, 58, who tried to kill Trump today, reportedly, is in videos, we're downloading it now, running around trying to recruit people to fight.
[02:59:28.079 --> 02:59:30.340]  We have video of this bozo.
[02:59:31.100 --> 02:59:31.781]  So here is...
[02:59:33.044 --> 02:59:38.306]  Ray Wesley Roth, 58, trying to recruit people to go and fight and die in NATO's war.
[02:59:38.366 --> 02:59:38.726]  Here it is.
[02:59:39.587 --> 02:59:40.427]  I don't do paper, though.
[02:59:40.627 --> 02:59:41.848]  I don't care if you do paper or not.
[02:59:41.868 --> 02:59:43.208]  I'm looking for revolutionaries.
[02:59:43.228 --> 02:59:45.349]  What number of people want to take this whole system down?
[02:59:45.369 --> 02:59:46.250]  Bro, I'm a veteran.
[02:59:46.290 --> 02:59:46.970]  Like, do you need me?
[02:59:47.110 --> 02:59:48.150]  What kind of veteran are you?
[02:59:48.330 --> 02:59:49.251]  Bro, I served in Newtown.
[02:59:49.271 --> 02:59:54.033]  Well, I think it's better to serve in fighting the powers fucking over the system.
[02:59:54.053 --> 02:59:55.754]  Bro, give me a Glock and a Hellcat.
[02:59:55.874 --> 02:59:56.594]  Take a look at this!
[02:59:56.634 --> 02:59:57.634]  Bro, but I don't do paper, though.
[02:59:57.674 --> 02:59:58.235]  I just told you that.
[02:59:58.255 --> 02:59:58.535]  Come on, dude.
[02:59:58.555 --> 02:59:58.975]  Then get away.
[03:00:01.522 --> 03:00:03.223]  I mean, a revolutionary.
[03:00:03.283 --> 03:00:04.023]  Bring the system down.
[03:00:04.063 --> 03:00:09.005]  Well, you certainly will, Mr. Roath with nuclear war, you lunatic demon.
[03:00:10.525 --> 03:00:11.506]  Lunatic demon.
[03:00:11.546 --> 03:00:17.508]  Whatever Dick Cheney wants, whatever the neocons want, whatever's completely evil the left supports.
[03:00:17.548 --> 03:00:20.349]  I mean, what a shameful group of whack jobs.
[03:00:21.809 --> 03:00:26.971]  Absolute, total, lying, crazy, demonic, pedophile whack jobs.
[03:00:27.912 --> 03:00:28.812]  All right, here's what I'm gonna do.
[03:00:30.888 --> 03:00:33.989]  I've got a bunch of breaking stuff behind the scenes and other reports I want to file.
[03:00:36.831 --> 03:00:38.011]  They're going to try to kill Trump again.
[03:00:38.051 --> 03:00:40.952]  This is now the second attempt and people are just like nonchalant about it.
[03:00:41.012 --> 03:00:41.593]  Okay, sure.
[03:00:42.973 --> 03:00:53.698]  And I'm going to have Chase Geiser come in here and sit in the seat for the last 40 minutes or so and just go through as many of the space commenters and speakers as he can.
[03:00:54.278 --> 03:00:55.579]  And then hopefully we're still here tomorrow.
[03:00:55.599 --> 03:00:56.559]  Nuclear war hasn't started.
[03:01:00.540 --> 03:01:01.600]  I'm going to follow more reports.
[03:01:01.640 --> 03:01:11.723]  I'm also going to cut out the key clips with Jack Posobiec and Ivan Reikland and others and get them up on X. And your job, folks, is to continue to ferret through information like you're doing and sending it to us and posting it.
[03:01:12.964 --> 03:01:19.386]  If you take your mission, if you accept what I'm saying, I think you agree with me, and to magnify all this information.
[03:01:19.406 --> 03:01:20.186]  But I just want to say this.
[03:01:20.726 --> 03:01:22.006]  I did one plug in the first hour.
[03:01:22.026 --> 03:01:23.727]  We're now three hours and 18 minutes in.
[03:01:24.307 --> 03:01:27.288]  If I don't promote and sell products, we won't be here.
[03:01:27.548 --> 03:01:30.069]  The crew hadn't gotten a raise in years.
[03:01:32.730 --> 03:01:34.011]  We're trying to survive.
[03:01:34.331 --> 03:01:41.217]  We've got the enemy trying to drill in and take us out right now, but I'm not making a big deal about that because we're just on our position exposing things.
[03:01:41.277 --> 03:01:45.761]  But at the same time, I need you to make the decision in such a dangerous time as this.
[03:01:46.221 --> 03:01:47.462]  We're on the verge of nuclear war.
[03:01:47.482 --> 03:01:49.204]  They're trying to steal the election, trying to kill Trump again.
[03:01:49.764 --> 03:01:51.585]  To go, man, we might want to support InfoWars.
[03:01:51.665 --> 03:01:54.366]  As Harrison said earlier, everybody sounds like me now.
[03:01:54.506 --> 03:01:56.507]  Not because they're even listening, though a lot of them are.
[03:01:56.928 --> 03:01:59.349]  It's because once you take the blinders off, you see the same thing I'm seeing.
[03:01:59.789 --> 03:02:02.951]  You may see a different perspective or something else I don't see because of your background understanding.
[03:02:03.351 --> 03:02:05.172]  I see more than you in areas, you see more than me.
[03:02:05.512 --> 03:02:07.773]  But dammit, we've been 98% accurate, okay?
[03:02:08.013 --> 03:02:10.715]  I'm a loyal American, a loyal human, mainly loyal to God.
[03:02:10.735 --> 03:02:12.916]  You know, those loyalties come, too, but...
[03:02:14.031 --> 03:02:14.592]  I love God.
[03:02:14.632 --> 03:02:15.252]  I love my family.
[03:02:15.272 --> 03:02:15.893]  I love my country.
[03:02:15.913 --> 03:02:16.393]  I love the truth.
[03:02:16.433 --> 03:02:17.094]  I love justice.
[03:02:17.234 --> 03:02:18.115]  I've been through hell.
[03:02:18.175 --> 03:02:19.576]  It's been a pleasure to do it, actually.
[03:02:19.916 --> 03:02:24.020]  I feel good at a core level, so satisfied to not be a coward and to tell the truth.
[03:02:24.921 --> 03:02:29.204]  But I'm asking you, I don't want to spend half my time trying to get money.
[03:02:30.485 --> 03:02:33.788]  And if you'll just go to infowarestore.com.
[03:02:33.808 --> 03:02:34.889]  Everybody needs water filtration.
[03:02:34.909 --> 03:02:37.251]  We have the highest quality, lowest prices, all the stuff in the water.
[03:02:37.271 --> 03:02:38.412]  You're crazy if you don't get an Alexa appear.

[03:02:42.620 --> 03:02:46.005]  We have the CBD gummies and thousand milligram tincture.
[03:02:46.325 --> 03:02:48.709]  That's basically as strong as it gets, super high quality.
[03:02:49.269 --> 03:02:51.292]  We get private label, one of the top brands in the country.
[03:02:51.332 --> 03:02:53.275]  We sell it for 40, 50 bucks with less than what they do.
[03:02:54.338 --> 03:02:56.579]  It's all there at infowarestore.com.

[03:03:06.984 --> 03:03:12.006]  The next level of financial energy is not, it's about to sell out, is not, is not, is not.
[03:03:13.191 --> 03:03:14.392]  A stimulant that has that effect.
[03:03:14.772 --> 03:03:15.492]  I'm on it right now.
[03:03:16.113 --> 03:03:16.813]  Totally clean.
[03:03:17.633 --> 03:03:18.414]  Totally amazing.
[03:03:18.834 --> 03:03:19.534]  It's about to sell out.
[03:03:19.554 --> 03:03:20.835]  Next level foundational energy.
[03:03:20.855 --> 03:03:21.415]  You want to get it?
[03:03:21.816 --> 03:03:22.996]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:03:23.576 --> 03:03:31.140]  And then our new great sponsor, that's so critical to get the word out of keeping us on air, thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:03:32.932 --> 03:03:34.073]  That's not part of InfoWars.
[03:03:34.093 --> 03:03:35.894]  That's not me, but I'm working with these great folks.
[03:03:36.334 --> 03:03:37.395]  They try to shut down InfoWars.
[03:03:37.415 --> 03:03:38.535]  We need sponsors in the future.
[03:03:39.936 --> 03:03:41.617]  For free, just put your email in.
[03:03:41.637 --> 03:03:43.558]  You can get in the raffle that comes out on Halloween.

[03:03:54.044 --> 03:03:55.325]  They say it's the baddest truck in the world.
[03:03:55.365 --> 03:03:57.747]  So smooth, so amazing, so incredible.
[03:03:57.967 --> 03:03:59.648]  And $10,000 cash for the winner.
[03:04:00.714 --> 03:04:04.015]  When you buy products, you get entered five or 10 times, depending on the day.
[03:04:04.035 --> 03:04:06.176]  Enter the raffle, it's all there.
[03:04:06.196 --> 03:04:09.917]  But the t-shirts, now it's over 40 of them and 30 hat designs are amazing.
[03:04:09.977 --> 03:04:10.798]  People love them.
[03:04:10.818 --> 03:04:14.139]  A lot of classic M4 shirts have been augmented, updated, never surrender.
[03:04:15.872 --> 03:04:19.393]  Don't don't snack on me shirt with a kitty cat on the front.
[03:04:19.973 --> 03:04:21.854]  We are not descended from fearful men.
[03:04:21.874 --> 03:04:21.854]  70 76.
[03:04:22.194 --> 03:04:25.735]  These are great shirts, and they fund the operations.
[03:04:25.755 --> 03:04:27.816]  I need you to go to the Alex Jones store dot com.
[03:04:28.536 --> 03:04:30.757]  And check out the shirts more being added daily.
[03:04:31.177 --> 03:04:32.197]  They're limited editions.
[03:04:32.217 --> 03:04:34.278]  They do like one big run of each, and that's it.
[03:04:34.358 --> 03:04:38.359]  And the new shirts we brought back the old save the frog shirt, but made it even bigger.
[03:04:39.355 --> 03:04:39.816]  Uh, and better.
[03:04:39.836 --> 03:04:42.519]  Uh, so that's a limited edition shirt.
[03:04:42.539 --> 03:04:44.641]  We brought a new version out.
[03:04:44.941 --> 03:04:46.483]  1776 hat with my signature on it.
[03:04:46.503 --> 03:04:48.205]  The answer in 1984, 1776.
[03:04:49.286 --> 03:04:51.929]  So many great products at thealexjonestore.com.
[03:04:51.949 --> 03:04:53.491]  I want to thank you all for your support.

[03:04:57.990 --> 03:04:58.630]  I need your help.
[03:04:59.050 --> 03:05:00.351]  I respectfully ask for your help.
[03:05:00.671 --> 03:05:05.492]  My goodness, I'm swinging from the fences here, and we keep delivering victory, thanks to God, working through you to give us support.
[03:05:05.873 --> 03:05:06.693]  Take action now.

[03:05:08.373 --> 03:05:09.714]  I'm asking humbly for your support.
[03:05:09.994 --> 03:05:13.795]  TheAlexJonesStore.com, InfoWareStore.com, DrJonesDactyls.com.
[03:05:14.035 --> 03:05:16.196]  Those are the quarters to get great products and fund the InfoWare.
[03:05:16.416 --> 03:05:20.857]  It's your choice at this crossroads in history, whether you want to just think this is another entertainment show.
[03:05:20.957 --> 03:05:22.418]  No, it's not another entertainment show.
[03:05:22.918 --> 03:05:25.799]  We got the deep state breathing on our neck because we're over the target.
[03:05:26.259 --> 03:05:27.279]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:05:27.779 --> 03:05:34.101]  All right, we're going to... Because World War III is a big issue.
[03:05:34.121 --> 03:05:36.442]  Oh, there's a bunch of clips here.
[03:05:36.462 --> 03:05:39.243]  I want Shakespeare to come get the chair and go right back to your spaces.
[03:05:40.583 --> 03:05:49.845]  As speakers, let's... I mean, they got video of them barbecuing cats on grills in Ohio now, but don't worry, the governor says it's not true.
[03:05:50.986 --> 03:05:51.346]  We've got...
[03:05:53.462 --> 03:05:57.107]  Democrat open borders plan to entrench single-party rule.
[03:05:58.989 --> 03:06:01.613]  We got women being harassed in Germany not wearing hijabs.
[03:06:02.594 --> 03:06:04.657]  We got Kamala Harris saying she will ban your guns now.
[03:06:06.374 --> 03:06:07.254]  Let's go to Nick Sordor.
[03:06:07.314 --> 03:06:12.196]  Nick, you host about three or four or five minutes while Chase gets in position in here to take over the rest of the show.
[03:06:12.736 --> 03:06:17.698]  And then I hope, to my lucky stars, we're on the air tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.
[03:06:17.818 --> 03:06:22.519]  because, I mean, they're gonna start tomorrow, today, next week, I hope they back off, start raining bombs on Russia.
[03:06:22.859 --> 03:06:23.520]  Our government is.
[03:06:24.100 --> 03:06:26.100]  I mean, it's just like, I don't even believe I'm saying this.
[03:06:26.381 --> 03:06:28.761]  And it's all over the news, like, great, let's, they won't do anything.
[03:06:28.781 --> 03:06:29.962]  I mean, phew!
[03:06:30.902 --> 03:06:37.244]  I mean, it's equivalent to spitting a cylinder and putting a gun to your head, but it's got like three out of the six cylinders with bullets in it.
[03:06:37.264 --> 03:06:44.747]  I mean, this is cuckoo, nutsoid, megalomania, Adolf Hitler type crap.
[03:06:45.907 --> 03:06:51.429]  So, for the left that hates Hitler, well, you sure love his behavior now, attacking Russia.
[03:06:52.470 --> 03:06:53.730]  He got his ass kicked.
[03:06:53.930 --> 03:06:54.931]  The Germans were mean as hell.
[03:06:56.024 --> 03:06:57.705]  And the Russians didn't have nuclear weapons.
[03:06:57.725 --> 03:07:02.167]  I mean, World War II, 90% was fought between the Russians and the Germans, boys and girls.
[03:07:03.188 --> 03:07:07.830]  So, Nick Sordor is going to comment here, and we're going to get Chase Geyser in the seat.
[03:07:07.850 --> 03:07:10.231]  I want to go work on some headlines and some stuff that's happening.
[03:07:10.271 --> 03:07:13.153]  That'll all be up on Relox Jones, themfortwars.com, band up video.
[03:07:13.173 --> 03:07:13.773]  Great job, crew.
[03:07:14.394 --> 03:07:14.934]  Here's Nick Sordor.
[03:07:15.885 --> 03:07:20.807]  Yeah, Alex, I don't know if you can hear me or not, it seems like there's a little bit of an audio issue here, but either way, I'll say it anyway.
[03:07:20.847 --> 03:07:43.676]  I'm here on the ground in Springfield, Ohio right now, and I have spoken to these people, and your name was actually brought up at one point, because you have the mainstream media here, you have NBC, they've been on the ground spewing the propaganda of the Harris regime, or the Biden-Harris regime, all in the past week and a half now, and these people have finally realized
[03:07:44.096 --> 03:07:53.266]  That people like you, who the mainstream media has put out there as some sort of, you know, wild kook that's just unhinged, what you have been saying has been true.
[03:07:53.566 --> 03:08:04.718]  This small town in Ohio has all of a sudden been taken over by people that have been shipped in, and they're losing their jobs, they're losing their residences, and you don't even have to talk about the dogs and cats and stuff.
[03:08:04.878 --> 03:08:06.640]  This is a bigger issue than that.
[03:08:07.080 --> 03:08:19.751]  These people are being forced to listen to the propaganda from the mainstream media that is basically telling them that they're a racist if they don't go along with this.
[03:08:20.011 --> 03:08:25.976]  If they don't allow themselves to be kicked out of their homes and they end up in shelters at this point.
[03:08:26.016 --> 03:08:30.400]  The homeless population has exploded and they're all native Springfieldians.
[03:08:31.080 --> 03:08:33.242]  It's wild.
[03:08:33.802 --> 03:08:35.963]  It's really sad what we're seeing going on here.
[03:08:36.604 --> 03:08:48.911]  And sort of related to that, NBC's Lester Holt just came out and said, quote, today's apparent assassination attempt comes amid increasingly fierce rhetoric on the campaign trail.
[03:08:49.191 --> 03:08:50.853]  Mr. Trump, his running mate J.D.
[03:08:50.913 --> 03:08:51.233]  Vance,
[03:08:51.833 --> 03:08:55.336]  continues to make baseless claims about Haitian immigrants.
[03:08:55.737 --> 03:08:58.699]  So we're talking about he just found a way.
[03:08:58.800 --> 03:09:12.192]  Lester Holt from NBC just found a way to link this assassination attempt and blame it on President Trump for what he's been saying about importing the third world and what the third world is doing in these communities.
[03:09:12.532 --> 03:09:14.254]  And they think people still buy this stuff?
[03:09:14.873 --> 03:09:16.054]  You've got to be kidding me.
[03:09:16.255 --> 03:09:17.456]  These people are over it.
[03:09:17.696 --> 03:09:22.922]  The regime, the deep state does not know what is coming for them at this point.
[03:09:23.242 --> 03:09:29.429]  I spoke with a law enforcement officer here today that was telling me, this is a state law enforcement officer.
[03:09:29.729 --> 03:09:31.271]  I spoke with him for about an hour and a half.
[03:09:31.691 --> 03:09:54.824]  And this guy is not, he's not unhinged, he's a normal dude, he was a lot of the things that were being claimed he actually shut down, but he told me he was terrified that there was going to be a false flag attack here, and he said he saw it forming, he's seen the quote-unquote people that instigated J6 on the ground here organizing, and that there was going to be a false flag attack.
[03:09:55.124 --> 03:09:59.607]  That is terrifying, and then we end up seeing something like this right afterward.
[03:10:00.385 --> 03:10:03.148]  People are waking up to this, and a lot of it is thanks to you, Alex.
[03:10:03.489 --> 03:10:08.034]  I'm not trying to toot your horn here, but I've heard it here myself.
[03:10:08.074 --> 03:10:08.955]  I didn't bring your name up.
[03:10:09.536 --> 03:10:12.579]  Other people here brought your name up, and they were thankful for what you do.
[03:10:12.659 --> 03:10:13.600]  So thank you very much.
[03:10:14.722 --> 03:10:15.963]  Well, Nick, thank you so much, too.
[03:10:16.684 --> 03:10:16.944]  Okay, perfect.
[03:10:40.211 --> 03:10:51.178]  It's one of those things, man, I don't know if you feel this way, where I wasn't surprised at all that there was a second attempt on Trump's life because we've been predicting it on this network ever since the first attempt.
[03:10:51.818 --> 03:10:55.521]  Alex, of course, since 2016 has been predicting the first attempt on Trump's life.
[03:10:55.881 --> 03:10:58.403]  But it's still shocking even when you're not surprised.
[03:10:59.003 --> 03:11:01.485]  When you finally hear it, it's like, oh, my God, it really happened.
[03:11:02.025 --> 03:11:02.685]  And, you know,
[03:11:03.926 --> 03:11:06.748]  As far as the campaign's concerned, I think this is going to be a huge boost for him.
[03:11:07.168 --> 03:11:09.589]  But something's got to change, man.
[03:11:09.709 --> 03:11:14.672]  And I don't know, like, I'm at a loss for... Hopefully Trump takes this seriously now.
[03:11:14.972 --> 03:11:24.298]  I've got 36 pages of documents linking the CIA to the Ukrainian Foreign Legion, which is basically a way to launder our troops or our people into this war.
[03:11:25.418 --> 03:11:27.740]  And keep in mind, Nick, I don't know if you remember this, man.
[03:11:28.200 --> 03:11:33.463]  Do you remember it was a couple of months ago that the CIA funded an organization that put
[03:11:34.063 --> 03:11:45.031]  Alex Jones and myself, other InfoWars writers like Jamie White and Adon Salazar and InfoWars crew members on an enemies of the state list in Ukraine.
[03:11:45.071 --> 03:11:57.981]  So the CIA funded this organization in Ukraine that made an enemies of the state list for being against increased funding for Ukraine when they gave $63 billion on Hitler's birthday to the Azov battalion and other Ukrainian leadership.
[03:11:58.781 --> 03:12:07.784]  And they're putting us on enemies of the state list while their own foreign legion cutouts are attempting to assassinate the former president of the United States.
[03:12:07.804 --> 03:12:15.087]  So how is it that I'm an enemy of the state, but Ukraine isn't an enemy of the state when they're now officially attempting to assassinate the president of the United States, Nick?
[03:12:16.329 --> 03:12:26.933]  You know what, I'm just gonna say, Chase, at this point, knowing what we know now about this guy, luckily there were people that, you know, the feds tried to scrub this extremely quickly, right?
[03:12:26.973 --> 03:12:31.414]  They tried to eliminate all, you know, Facebook took down his profile within minutes.
[03:12:31.914 --> 03:12:32.214]  Minutes.
[03:12:32.274 --> 03:12:33.495]  Yeah, because the CIA called him.
[03:12:34.615 --> 03:12:35.036]  Exactly.
[03:12:35.076 --> 03:12:36.677]  All it takes is that one phone call.
[03:12:36.697 --> 03:12:39.479]  They didn't want us to know what we know right now.
[03:12:39.800 --> 03:12:41.781]  They're not the ones that actually released the name.
[03:12:42.101 --> 03:12:43.823]  We had to find out through other sources.
[03:12:44.083 --> 03:12:45.864]  Law enforcement sources that leaked it.
[03:12:46.185 --> 03:12:53.591]  Because the FBI, what they're going to try to do now at this point, you think that they've been burying the Butler investigation?
[03:12:54.338 --> 03:12:55.699]  Look at what they're going to do to this now.
[03:12:56.019 --> 03:12:58.300]  This is going to be memory hold so quickly.
[03:12:58.580 --> 03:13:06.483]  And what I fear is they're going to have to do something else to blow up the news cycle this week to make us stop talking about this.
[03:13:06.744 --> 03:13:10.065]  This is the worst case scenario for them at this point.
[03:13:10.085 --> 03:13:13.967]  This guy that's literally trying to recruit people to go fight in Ukraine.
[03:13:14.267 --> 03:13:18.669]  That's the last thing the deep state and the warmongers
[03:13:18.769 --> 03:13:19.309]  We're good to go.
[03:13:34.742 --> 03:13:40.529]  Was Ukrainian backed when a Ukrainian member of the Foreign Legion just tried to kill former President Donald Trump?
[03:13:40.709 --> 03:13:43.572]  I think it's very obvious where the collusion is happening.
[03:13:43.612 --> 03:13:47.336]  It's in our own deep state, our own deep state cutouts like Ukraine itself.
[03:13:47.857 --> 03:13:49.719]  It's just absolutely disgusting.
[03:13:49.739 --> 03:13:51.021]  I want to hear a little bit from Honey Badger.
[03:13:51.061 --> 03:13:52.983]  Honey Badger, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say.
[03:13:54.505 --> 03:13:58.668]  Well, I was talking to Nick about this earlier, and you know, again, exactly right.
[03:13:58.828 --> 03:14:01.911]  We, you know, how soon did we forget about the last assassination attempt?
[03:14:01.931 --> 03:14:02.792]  Not once, not twice.
[03:14:02.832 --> 03:14:04.153]  This won't be the last time either.
[03:14:04.773 --> 03:14:11.719]  You know, and taking a step forward, you know, it's interesting to me, I don't know if anybody else caught it, but apparently one of his handlers was ex-CIA.
[03:14:12.975 --> 03:14:18.485]  He forgot to apparently disconnect or I say unfollow this woman.
[03:14:19.406 --> 03:14:20.468]  Do you ever name gorillas?
[03:14:21.650 --> 03:14:25.858]  Anyways, before he before he attempted it.
[03:14:26.514 --> 03:14:28.855]  And I'll put it, I'll put it actually in the purple pill, yeah.
[03:14:29.295 --> 03:14:31.575]  It's been, it's being reported, um, widely.
[03:14:31.635 --> 03:14:34.556]  So this is going to get more interesting before it doesn't.
[03:14:34.576 --> 03:14:44.039]  But again, like, just like Nick said, you know, there's, there's going to be some other, some other issue this week, unfortunately, but this is the way that they're going to bury it in the news cycle, just like they did the first attempt.
[03:14:44.119 --> 03:14:45.599]  And I can't believe how soon we forgot.
[03:14:46.311 --> 03:14:47.192]  Well, exactly.
[03:14:47.212 --> 03:14:58.665]  And one of the things I want to mention, if you look back on the first assassination attempt of Trump, you have the Krasensteins, the Sissons and others coming out saying that this shooter was a conservative, a Republican.
[03:14:59.086 --> 03:15:01.749]  Obviously, if the guy tried to kill Trump, he's not a Trump supporter.
[03:15:01.909 --> 03:15:02.089]  Right.
[03:15:02.409 --> 03:15:15.078]  And now I saw a report, a post earlier from Ed Krasenstein that the shooter today was somebody who backed Vivek and somebody who backed Nikki Haley as if that means it was a conservative, a right-wing extremist that tried to kill President Trump.
[03:15:15.098 --> 03:15:15.858]  It's like, no, no, no.
[03:15:16.099 --> 03:15:22.543]  It's obvious the reason this person backed Nikki Haley and Vivek is because they were running against Trump.
[03:15:22.863 --> 03:15:23.183]  Go ahead.
[03:15:24.324 --> 03:15:25.565]  Oh, she wants to nuke Moscow.
[03:15:25.625 --> 03:15:27.486]  Of course he's going to back Nikki Haley.
[03:15:27.526 --> 03:15:28.926]  I mean, that has nothing to do with it.
[03:15:29.207 --> 03:15:32.308]  She is the anti-Trump in the Republican Party.
[03:15:32.328 --> 03:15:34.989]  That's why you saw so many Democrats going for Nikki Haley.
[03:15:35.230 --> 03:15:46.075]  But the left is now, they're in a chaos mode because they know at this point they have to go on the defense because the American people are now looking at this and saying, okay, they just tried to kill Trump again.
[03:15:46.375 --> 03:15:47.876]  You saw what happened after the first time.
[03:15:47.916 --> 03:15:49.797]  The support spiked because, you know, people
[03:15:50.817 --> 03:15:59.881]  You don't have to have more than a room temperature IQ to realize, oh, well, this guy, you know, he might be onto something if they keep trying to kill him over and over again.
[03:16:00.221 --> 03:16:02.342]  Nobody's attempting to kill somebody that isn't winning.
[03:16:02.362 --> 03:16:03.662]  They're trying to say that he's not winning.
[03:16:03.682 --> 03:16:04.503]  Right.
[03:16:04.603 --> 03:16:05.263]  I'm sorry, but...
[03:16:05.843 --> 03:16:12.905]  Clearly, this kind of tells me that they're definitely terrified, at least some faction of the Democrat Party, that Trump is actually going to win.
[03:16:12.985 --> 03:16:24.307]  And it's crazy, too, if you notice in the debate with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, Kamala said, you know, Tim Walz and I are both gun owners, assuring the audience that they weren't going to try to take your gun or ban guns.
[03:16:24.647 --> 03:16:29.548]  And then just yesterday or the day before, Kamala Harris's official vice presidential
[03:16:30.248 --> 03:16:30.989]  I don't know.
[03:16:51.308 --> 03:16:55.771]  They're trying to persecute political dissidents like Steve Bannon and Owen Schroer and others.
[03:16:55.791 --> 03:17:00.493]  They're trying to wage lawfare against Infowars and Alex Jones, where they want to literally steal his identity.
[03:17:00.854 --> 03:17:01.554]  That's the issue.
[03:17:01.594 --> 03:17:06.457]  It's not the fact that this guy was able to get a long-range rifle and fire off some shots.
[03:17:06.577 --> 03:17:07.377]  That's not the issue.
[03:17:07.397 --> 03:17:16.003]  The issue is that the deep state is actively interfering in our elections in multiple ways, leaving our borders open, allowing 20,000 Haitians to invade Springfield, Ohio.
[03:17:16.223 --> 03:17:18.304]  They're trying to interfere in our elections.
[03:17:18.544 --> 03:17:20.885]  And they're going to blame this now on our Second Amendment right.
[03:17:20.905 --> 03:17:27.648]  They're going to try to make it about Trump's rhetoric, try to make it about the Second Amendment itself, the Constitution itself being the reason that this could even happen.
[03:17:27.668 --> 03:17:29.509]  It's just so obnoxious and sickening.
[03:17:29.549 --> 03:17:30.129]  Nick, what do you think?
[03:17:34.171 --> 03:17:35.212]  Looks like we might have lost you, Nick.
[03:17:35.232 --> 03:17:35.752]  I'm going to go ahead.
[03:17:35.792 --> 03:17:37.213]  No, you haven't lost me.
[03:17:37.373 --> 03:17:39.954]  I'll go ahead and jump in on this.
[03:17:39.974 --> 03:17:43.676]  And I'm just saying it seems like the mainstream media at this point has gotten their talking points.
[03:17:44.452 --> 03:17:54.577]  I mean, it's shameless to think that you can possibly, you know, they're already terrified about what's being exposed in Springfield.
[03:17:54.857 --> 03:17:57.538]  And then you get, I mean, what kind of a stretch is it?
[03:17:58.239 --> 03:18:05.102]  How desperate do you have to be to say that Trump talking about the problems being caused by illegal Haitian immigrants
[03:18:06.480 --> 03:18:11.165]  Is the reason that he has been... They've made another attempt on his life tonight.
[03:18:11.425 --> 03:18:12.906]  I don't understand that.
[03:18:12.986 --> 03:18:19.974]  At this point, it seems like there's no way... Give me feedback down there in the comments, guys.
[03:18:20.554 --> 03:18:21.556]  Tell me what you think.
[03:18:21.616 --> 03:18:23.397]  Are people buying this anymore?
[03:18:23.417 --> 03:18:28.563]  I mean, how stupid do you have to be to think that Trump talking about illegal Haitians
[03:18:29.083 --> 03:18:32.704]  is a reason to blame him for this assassination attempt today.
[03:18:32.724 --> 03:18:35.805]  I don't understand how they say this with a straight face.
[03:18:35.845 --> 03:18:37.025]  Maybe I'm the crazy one.
[03:18:37.245 --> 03:18:37.565]  I don't know.
[03:18:37.866 --> 03:18:42.987]  Well, you are crazy, Nick, but when the world is a crazy place, it takes crazy people to solve the problems, right?
[03:18:43.007 --> 03:18:50.029]  Radical problems require radical solutions, and I've always admired your insight and analysis and hard work and just true patriotism.
[03:18:50.069 --> 03:18:52.470]  Let's go to Dr. Simon Goddick.
[03:18:52.550 --> 03:18:54.370]  Dr. Simon Goddick, I started following you recently.
[03:18:54.690 --> 03:18:55.911]  You've been doing some amazing reporting.
[03:18:55.951 --> 03:18:57.471]  Go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say.
[03:18:59.645 --> 03:19:00.525]  Hey, hey, hey, what's up?
[03:19:01.606 --> 03:19:08.269]  So I think you don't follow me, but anyway, I've been diving into Ryan Ruth's website.
[03:19:08.289 --> 03:19:10.490]  So he has this website, VoteRyanRuth.com.
[03:19:10.550 --> 03:19:15.072]  So he was running for Mayor of Honolulu, Hawaii.
[03:19:15.332 --> 03:19:15.592]  Wow.
[03:19:15.892 --> 03:19:18.633]  And yes, so the website is still online.
[03:19:18.773 --> 03:19:22.835]  It's like a blog, you know, this 90s blog, the PHPBB blog.
[03:19:23.739 --> 03:19:25.381]  And I've read all the posts.
[03:19:25.421 --> 03:19:28.524]  So while everybody was raging on Axe, I was reading all the posts.
[03:19:28.544 --> 03:19:33.488]  So he actually made posts that he wanted to declare war on roosters, you know.
[03:19:34.369 --> 03:19:36.771]  Well, it sounds familiar with all the Haitian stuff that's going on.
[03:19:37.919 --> 03:19:43.905]  Yeah, I think he must have PTSD, because everything that creates some kind of noise, he wanted to ban.
[03:19:44.425 --> 03:19:47.188]  So, roosters, fireworks, etc.
[03:19:47.228 --> 03:20:00.460]  But he also made a remarkable post, in which he writes, I have been to Ukraine twice for eight months total, and communist Russia and Putin must be eliminated and dissolved at all costs, including boots on the ground.
[03:20:01.224 --> 03:20:10.372]  So he even wanted to embrace like having like teaming up or making Iran and North Korea allies.
[03:20:11.333 --> 03:20:12.814]  So it's totally wild.
[03:20:12.934 --> 03:20:19.800]  And then I was going on the on the bellopedia and to check whether he was on the list for the Honolulu election.
[03:20:19.840 --> 03:20:20.540]  I couldn't find him.
[03:20:21.001 --> 03:20:23.423]  So not even as a withdrawn disqualified candidate.
[03:20:23.463 --> 03:20:26.045]  So he was simply not on the ballot.
[03:20:26.838 --> 03:20:32.743]  Yeah, well it's possible that he decided to run too late and was doing a write-in campaign.
[03:20:33.283 --> 03:20:34.964]  Who knows what's really going on with that.
[03:20:34.984 --> 03:20:36.345]  Bill Elmore, you've had your hand raised for some time.
[03:20:36.385 --> 03:20:37.486]  Bill, what are your thoughts?
[03:20:55.020 --> 03:20:56.741]  Yeah, just connecting the dots, right?
[03:20:58.801 --> 03:21:00.482]  This guy didn't just pop up, right?
[03:21:00.722 --> 03:21:03.483]  Everything he said about his background is now public knowledge.
[03:21:04.603 --> 03:21:14.746]  He created a sniper nest at the right place at the right time, even had ceramic tiles hanging over the fence to shield his heat signature, right?
[03:21:15.887 --> 03:21:23.389]  He had posted right after the first attempt on Trump's life, underneath a Kamala post,
[03:21:24.153 --> 03:21:31.059]  Criticizing Trump for not doing enough for the, or not caring about the people who were killed at that.
[03:21:32.480 --> 03:21:39.845]  The media had an immediate response and it just had to tone it down to say it was something different.
[03:21:40.806 --> 03:21:44.029]  So either they were just, you know, pining for the next attempt.
[03:21:45.058 --> 03:21:51.120]  Or, you know, if you want to put your conspiracy hat on, they knew something was going to happen.
[03:21:51.440 --> 03:21:54.260]  It was an unannounced outing.
[03:21:55.561 --> 03:22:05.283]  There's too many things to say that this is not, you know, something more nefarious than just some crackpot who wanted to take a shot at Trump.
[03:22:05.403 --> 03:22:08.984]  So it's interesting to watch it all play out.
[03:22:09.524 --> 03:22:12.105]  But, you know, this guy,
[03:22:14.319 --> 03:22:16.042]  Arm to the teeth, right?
[03:22:16.542 --> 03:22:19.486]  Being who he is, who he works for, worked for.
[03:22:19.506 --> 03:22:23.170]  You know, this, it's inevitable.
[03:22:23.430 --> 03:22:28.256]  And I like what Alex was saying earlier about, you know, embrace the digital.
[03:22:28.968 --> 03:22:29.208]  Right?
[03:22:29.829 --> 03:22:31.449]  You know, Trump's rallies are huge.
[03:22:31.490 --> 03:22:33.070]  You get 5-10,000 people.
[03:22:33.210 --> 03:22:36.933]  Well, get on Spaces with Elon, you get 30 million, right?
[03:22:37.333 --> 03:22:40.234]  Go on with Joe Rogan.
[03:22:40.855 --> 03:22:47.739]  Start embracing the digital audience and save their life, you know?
[03:22:47.779 --> 03:22:48.639]  Get more protective.
[03:22:48.699 --> 03:22:49.680]  So, my thoughts.
[03:22:50.083 --> 03:22:50.823]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:22:50.863 --> 03:23:02.108]  And you see the left bragging about how many viewers watched the CNN interview of Kamala, or how many viewers tuned into the debate with Trump and Kamala, and it pales in comparison.
[03:23:02.148 --> 03:23:03.328]  And that's an understatement.
[03:23:03.368 --> 03:23:04.889]  It pales in comparison.
[03:23:05.549 --> 03:23:10.211]  To the amount of listeners that Musk and Trump got on their X spaces.
[03:23:10.591 --> 03:23:13.112]  And so there is a way for him to do this campaign digitally.
[03:23:13.152 --> 03:23:14.173]  I think that will reach more people.
[03:23:14.273 --> 03:23:25.057]  One thing I will say as a criticism of Trump, obviously I adore him and I'm voting for him enthusiastically, is I'm disappointed that he has not leveraged X the same way that he leverages his truth social account.
[03:23:25.597 --> 03:23:26.557]  What are your thoughts on that?
[03:23:26.618 --> 03:23:30.019]  David Reilly, let's go ahead and get you to unmute yourself and say what you have to say if you're still with us.
[03:23:32.069 --> 03:23:33.271]  Hold on one second.
[03:23:33.411 --> 03:23:33.892]  No problem.
[03:23:33.912 --> 03:23:35.875]  Just raise your hand when you're ready David and we can go back to you.
[03:23:37.196 --> 03:23:39.019]  Alright, let's go to Sam.
[03:23:39.499 --> 03:23:41.202]  Sam, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say, sir.
[03:23:42.031 --> 03:23:42.891]  Hey, appreciate it.
[03:23:42.911 --> 03:23:43.611]  Thanks for having me up.
[03:23:43.651 --> 03:23:53.594]  Yeah, you know, I just got done looking through the 19 Facebook posts that this guy allegedly made, and I just wanted to review some inconsistencies I found.
[03:23:53.634 --> 03:23:57.175]  I don't really know exactly what's going on, but I think people should be made aware.
[03:23:57.895 --> 03:24:03.397]  Obviously, yeah, the Facebook was taken down, but I was able to capture a video that scrolled through and showed all the posts.
[03:24:04.017 --> 03:24:10.479]  Number one, he only had 19 total posts on his Facebook going back about two years.
[03:24:11.512 --> 03:24:26.006]  And they all dealt with recruiting Afghan special forces soldiers for Ukraine, or there were a couple of COVID posts and stuff related to protecting Taiwan.
[03:24:26.026 --> 03:24:32.132]  And then there was a single post about with a Palestine map that still had the creases in it.
[03:24:33.235 --> 03:24:35.338]  So a few things struck me about this.
[03:24:35.738 --> 03:24:49.297]  In his last post, or second to the last post, he said he was getting hundreds of volunteers, hundreds of applicants hitting him up on his Facebook messages.
[03:24:49.864 --> 03:24:50.024]  Correct.
[03:24:50.044 --> 03:24:50.244]  Correct.
[03:25:10.900 --> 03:25:20.127]  So there's no way that he was getting hundreds of Facebook messages and hundreds of WhatsApp messages from his six or eight posts on Facebook.
[03:25:20.148 --> 03:25:21.028]  So that was a lie.
[03:25:21.068 --> 03:25:21.989]  That's clearly fake.
[03:25:22.009 --> 03:25:22.649]  That's number one.
[03:25:23.090 --> 03:25:33.818]  Number two, he was posting in Pashto, the language of Afghanistan, asking for Afghan special forces who spoke perfect English.
[03:25:34.319 --> 03:25:39.883]  Now, if you're looking for Afghan special forces who speak perfect English, why are you posting in Pashto?
[03:25:41.056 --> 03:25:41.737]  Alright, number one.
[03:25:41.977 --> 03:25:49.641]  And number two, how many perfect English-speaking Afghan Special Forces soldiers are cruising random Facebook posts?
[03:25:50.602 --> 03:25:55.745]  Like, is that really a great Afghan, you know, Special Forces recruiting pipeline?
[03:25:56.525 --> 03:26:01.008]  I mean, he was getting like three comments, smiley faces, laughy emojis on some of these posts.
[03:26:01.508 --> 03:26:04.950]  Like, not hundreds of Facebook applicants like he was letting on.
[03:26:05.490 --> 03:26:10.153]  What this whole Facebook profile strikes me as just a setup.
[03:26:10.614 --> 03:26:11.394]  It's just fake.
[03:26:35.270 --> 03:26:47.601]  Right, or knowing that he would either be killed or detained, he might have populated it with information that he wanted to kind of be confusing.
[03:26:57.373 --> 03:26:58.275]  Confusing.
[03:26:58.576 --> 03:27:02.002]  They want to make it look like a certain thing, but it's all fake.
[03:27:03.224 --> 03:27:06.310]  If he's an asset, that's going to be activated to do things.
[03:27:06.974 --> 03:27:10.716]  Uh, like he could, you know, you like, you got some big, you got some COVID stuff there.
[03:27:10.736 --> 03:27:12.257]  You got some Taiwan stuff.
[03:27:12.297 --> 03:27:14.298]  You got some Palestine stuff.
[03:27:14.338 --> 03:27:15.539]  You got some Ukraine stuff.
[03:27:15.859 --> 03:27:18.081]  So that gives them a lot of options.
[03:27:18.221 --> 03:27:26.425]  Like he can, you know, partake, participate in perhaps different operations and have it covered by the variety of his Facebook posts.
[03:27:26.466 --> 03:27:28.106]  Now there's only like 19 of them, like I said.
[03:27:28.447 --> 03:27:30.128]  And by the way, like who,
[03:27:31.188 --> 03:27:36.711]  Show me somebody who's only got 19 Facebook posts, never anything regular, normal.
[03:27:37.252 --> 03:27:38.873]  Unless he's scrubbed it.
[03:27:38.913 --> 03:27:39.133]  Right.
[03:27:39.813 --> 03:27:42.535]  Well, yeah, unless he's scrubbed it.
[03:27:42.575 --> 03:27:44.696]  But, you know, so it's fake.
[03:27:45.056 --> 03:27:47.838]  It's meant to it's meant to tell a story.
[03:27:47.878 --> 03:27:52.760]  And I think I just think the story that most people are grabbing from it is the wrong story.
[03:27:52.780 --> 03:27:55.862]  It's the story they're trying to communicate to
[03:27:55.862 --> 03:27:56.082]  Mm-hmm.
[03:28:14.438 --> 03:28:20.723]  And have you noticed that, like, they're all basically the same length and the same information just over and over?
[03:28:20.743 --> 03:28:22.164]  They look like bot posts.
[03:28:22.384 --> 03:28:24.286]  I saw screenshots of them in bulk.
[03:28:24.526 --> 03:28:30.951]  Yeah, February 4th, I wish that someone in Haiti would reach out to me so that I can supply thousands of NATO trained Afghan soldiers very cheaply.
[03:28:30.971 --> 03:28:33.212]  He lists his phone number, he says, on April 22nd.
[03:28:34.313 --> 03:28:35.213]  Yeah, it's just all fake.
[03:28:35.233 --> 03:28:35.753]  It's all fake.
[03:28:35.773 --> 03:28:42.734]  So like whatever, whatever story that like, we can't hang our hat on like what's being explicitly said on his social media because it's being used to
[03:29:03.578 --> 03:29:04.178]  We're good to go.
[03:29:33.639 --> 03:29:36.461]  I'll just leave this for a parting shot.
[03:29:57.295 --> 03:29:57.696]  We're good.
[03:30:06.073 --> 03:30:13.276]  At the time, this was used to frame him as, like, you know, some anti-Zionist, Jew-hating, you know, terrorist wacko.
[03:30:13.837 --> 03:30:16.918]  But that was all a misdirect, and we see that in hindsight.
[03:30:17.198 --> 03:30:26.402]  So here this guy's got a single picture of a Palestine map, like, just out of the blue with the creases still in it, a random Facebook post.
[03:30:26.442 --> 03:30:29.303]  And now everybody's posting it, and they're trying to make hay out of it.
[03:30:29.363 --> 03:30:31.825]  And so, like, I'll just leave that with people.
[03:30:32.005 --> 03:30:32.705]  It's all fake.
[03:30:32.745 --> 03:30:34.006]  It's a misdirect.
[03:30:34.026 --> 03:30:34.846]  So see past that.
[03:30:35.768 --> 03:30:36.269]  Absolutely.
[03:30:36.289 --> 03:30:38.776]  Alright, let's hear from American Papa Bear if you're with us.
[03:30:38.816 --> 03:30:41.122]  American Papa Bear, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say.
[03:30:44.187 --> 03:30:45.708]  Hey, thanks for bringing me onto the stage, guys.
[03:30:45.728 --> 03:30:46.528]  I really appreciate it.
[03:30:47.129 --> 03:30:50.330]  So I just hopped in a little while ago, so I didn't get to hear a lot of what the speakers were saying.
[03:30:50.350 --> 03:30:52.952]  I just kind of wanted to give you guys my two cents on the situation.
[03:30:54.012 --> 03:30:56.273]  I'm not surprised at all that this attempt happened.
[03:30:57.614 --> 03:31:01.096]  Ever since J13, I knew that something was going to keep happening.
[03:31:01.156 --> 03:31:02.516]  These attempts are going to keep happening.
[03:31:03.337 --> 03:31:07.619]  And if anybody thinks that it was just a one-time deal in Butler, Pennsylvania,
[03:31:10.708 --> 03:31:11.008]  Yeah.
[03:31:11.028 --> 03:31:11.108]  Yes.
[03:31:11.128 --> 03:31:11.188]  Yes.
[03:31:47.944 --> 03:31:48.265]  I agree with you.
[03:31:48.285 --> 03:31:49.988]  David Reilly, it looks like you're ready to speak.
[03:31:50.008 --> 03:31:50.509]  What's up, David?
[03:31:50.529 --> 03:31:51.230]  What's on your mind?
[03:31:58.725 --> 03:32:00.347]  Hey, thank you so much for having me on.
[03:32:00.367 --> 03:32:14.380]  Yeah, you know, I was in another space just earlier and people were talking about how, you know, this nonsense about the cats in Ohio, the rhetoric leading to a boiling point in America, and that's why this is happening.
[03:32:14.420 --> 03:32:16.602]  And I just kind of wanted to point out a couple of things.
[03:32:16.642 --> 03:32:22.988]  There is a phrase, a term that was being used by the left against the right a few years ago called stochastic terrorism.
[03:32:23.448 --> 03:32:23.908]  Yeah.
[03:32:41.005 --> 03:32:43.706]  That's the perfect definition of stochastic terrorism.
[03:32:43.966 --> 03:33:06.690]  And if you want to look at some interesting stuff, I would say the doppelganger affidavit that came out as part of this Tenet media scandal, there was a page in document four towards the end that is talking very frankly about how a part of the narrative that was supposed to be disseminated is that if America is in a civil war, that would be better for Israel.
[03:33:07.350 --> 03:33:07.791]  Interesting.
[03:33:07.831 --> 03:33:10.556]  I'd love for you to share that document with me so I can take a look too.
[03:33:19.076 --> 03:33:19.337]  I will.
[03:33:19.357 --> 03:33:20.518]  I'll send it to you in a DM.
[03:33:20.838 --> 03:33:37.138]  But it's worth looking at because all of this talk about civil war, you know, all the talk about civil war that came after the first assassination attempt, I mean, it seems very clearly that regardless of which country it is, outside nations do not want America to be stable in any way at all.
[03:33:38.499 --> 03:33:44.520]  And so, you know, I think that there's a lot of moves going on here, and it's worth looking into.
[03:33:44.540 --> 03:33:45.720]  I'll DM that to you right now.
[03:33:45.960 --> 03:33:46.480]  Thank you, David.
[03:33:46.500 --> 03:33:46.980]  I appreciate that.
[03:33:47.000 --> 03:33:48.621]  Alex Stone, you've had your hand raised for some time.
[03:33:48.681 --> 03:33:50.201]  Go ahead and unmute yourself and share what you have to say.
[03:33:51.221 --> 03:33:52.981]  Yeah, Chase, thanks for having me on.
[03:33:53.001 --> 03:33:53.762]  I appreciate it.
[03:33:54.102 --> 03:33:56.922]  You know, obviously, you know, Alex is a Christian.
[03:33:56.962 --> 03:33:57.682]  I'm a Christian.
[03:33:57.742 --> 03:33:58.762]  Roger Stone is a Christian.
[03:33:58.802 --> 03:34:03.763]  We've all been talking about the, you know, prophetic nature of these assassination attempts.
[03:34:03.823 --> 03:34:07.564]  It's going to happen again, but something I want to make clear is that
[03:34:08.544 --> 03:34:15.367]  Everything has fallen apart for these people, whether it be the assassination attempts or the legal battles that President Trump is facing.
[03:34:15.767 --> 03:34:22.190]  They're all falling apart, and the reason why is because you cannot kill someone that God wants alive.
[03:34:22.650 --> 03:34:23.850]  I believe that with my whole heart.
[03:34:25.371 --> 03:34:36.936]  Another thing that I want to mention, I was at Tucker Carlson's event in Wichita, Kansas the other day, and something that he was talking about is how these people always claim the moral high ground on everything.
[03:34:37.529 --> 03:34:41.612]  And right now these are people are the ones who are claiming that Donald Trump is Hitler.
[03:34:42.152 --> 03:34:48.256]  And I don't care about their rhetoric about how they, you know, think that it's terrible that this is happening.
[03:34:49.128 --> 03:34:52.570]  It is moral for them to kill Hitler, okay?
[03:34:52.790 --> 03:34:53.890]  And they think he's Hitler.
[03:34:53.930 --> 03:34:54.971]  It is moral for them.
[03:34:55.191 --> 03:34:57.712]  And that's a classic tactic to dehumanize the opponent.
[03:34:57.792 --> 03:34:59.613]  In World War II, we called the Germans Krauts.
[03:35:00.113 --> 03:35:02.174]  In Vietnam, we called the Vietnamese Charlie.
[03:35:02.495 --> 03:35:09.818]  You dehumanize and lump them all into one personification to kind of as a psychological cope to make it easier to eradicate the enemy.
[03:35:09.838 --> 03:35:15.401]  And by calling him Hitler over and over again, these people feel like they're doing the right thing by killing an innocent person.
[03:35:16.994 --> 03:35:17.535]  I don't know.
[03:35:34.045 --> 03:35:34.405]  I don't know.
[03:35:57.142 --> 03:36:01.966]  To Kamala Harris' campaign, that this has happened a second time in as many months to Donald Trump.
[03:36:02.166 --> 03:36:03.347]  This is going to be a major boost.
[03:36:03.387 --> 03:36:07.429]  And, you know, I was worried that people had already forgotten what happened on July 13th.
[03:36:07.469 --> 03:36:10.251]  It was so iconic, what happened, especially with the photos.
[03:36:10.292 --> 03:36:12.653]  It was just, I mean, it was perfect.
[03:36:12.753 --> 03:36:15.235]  Obviously, it was a terrible thing that happened, and I wish that it hadn't.
[03:36:15.495 --> 03:36:17.517]  But from a campaign perspective, it was perfect.
[03:36:17.877 --> 03:36:21.039]  Now that this has happened a second time, I don't think people are going to forget.
[03:36:21.119 --> 03:36:22.300]  What do you think, Ms.
[03:36:22.380 --> 03:36:22.620]  Liu?
[03:36:22.740 --> 03:36:25.983]  Do you think people are going to remember these two assassination attempts come November 5th?
[03:36:27.970 --> 03:36:32.471]  I think the media is going to sway their base into not giving a damn.
[03:36:32.911 --> 03:36:35.232]  I'm absolutely apoplectic right now, Chase.
[03:36:35.532 --> 03:36:36.172]  Absolutely.
[03:36:36.672 --> 03:36:38.673]  Because I smell MKUltra.
[03:36:39.033 --> 03:36:40.854]  This is CIA all over.
[03:36:40.874 --> 03:36:43.855]  If you look all the shooters back to 63 and even earlier.
[03:36:43.875 --> 03:36:44.795]  They're all the same.
[03:36:44.835 --> 03:36:47.636]  All planned in the deep state.
[03:36:47.676 --> 03:36:49.136]  They have a Gladio operation.
[03:36:49.176 --> 03:36:52.377]  They use third parties to do domestic damage.
[03:36:52.857 --> 03:36:54.658]  And here's the thing, okay?
[03:36:55.118 --> 03:36:55.858]  The reason
[03:36:56.338 --> 03:37:06.933]  The number one reason that they want to and feel they have to kill Donald Trump is because he wants to stop global war.
[03:37:07.890 --> 03:37:09.971]  War is the number one problem.
[03:37:10.051 --> 03:37:22.799]  Yes, it is not a coincidence that this has happened in the same week that the Biden administration comes out and says it's going to allow long-range missiles, high-tech missiles from NATO, U.S., and British manufacturers with U.S.
[03:37:22.880 --> 03:37:23.360]  and British assistance.
[03:37:23.380 --> 03:37:24.340]  I have to add one more thing.
[03:37:24.541 --> 03:37:24.921]  Go ahead.
[03:37:25.341 --> 03:37:26.422]  I have to add one more thing.
[03:37:28.143 --> 03:37:32.986]  That Wilde, Susie Wilde, and the campaign people
[03:37:33.912 --> 03:37:38.034]  I don't think have their freaking eyes open or they're being complicit.
[03:37:38.655 --> 03:37:42.577]  I can't figure it out, but they have made so many wrong moves with this man.
[03:37:43.157 --> 03:37:49.361]  He needs to absolutely, what an earlier speaker had said truthfully, he needs to bunker down.
[03:37:49.661 --> 03:37:51.102]  This is no longer a joke.
[03:37:51.622 --> 03:37:55.344]  And the people who are surrounding him, I don't think are giving him great advice.
[03:37:55.804 --> 03:37:56.725]  I'll be honest with you.
[03:37:57.145 --> 03:38:02.308]  I don't trust his campaign and I don't trust a lot of the people who are in his inner circle.
[03:38:03.592 --> 03:38:06.674]  Well, there was no excuse for the assassination attempt to happen the first time.
[03:38:06.815 --> 03:38:09.756]  There's certainly no excuse for a second one to happen.
[03:38:09.776 --> 03:38:09.957]  No.
[03:38:10.277 --> 03:38:17.462]  But he's got to get together with people like Bongino, Prince, all the outside guys who are professional shooters.
[03:38:17.882 --> 03:38:19.403]  Forget the Secret Service.
[03:38:19.483 --> 03:38:20.624]  Forget the FBI.
[03:38:20.664 --> 03:38:21.804]  They're all complicit.
[03:38:22.105 --> 03:38:25.447]  I'm not saying there aren't good agents in both, you know, institutions.
[03:38:25.807 --> 03:38:28.369]  I'm saying the heads of the snake are driving this train.
[03:38:28.829 --> 03:38:29.210]  Absolutely.
[03:38:29.230 --> 03:38:29.810]  Absolutely.
[03:38:30.151 --> 03:38:30.891]  Oh, too late.
[03:38:30.911 --> 03:38:32.273]  It's all been documented now.
[03:38:50.655 --> 03:38:52.716]  Yep, I took my snapshot.
[03:38:52.776 --> 03:39:01.199]  I'm sure Elon Musk was pretending to miss the call from the CIA for at least an hour or two or three or four or five to give people a chance to back everything up.
[03:39:01.719 --> 03:39:03.379]  Now that it's all backed up, they're like, oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
[03:39:03.399 --> 03:39:03.900]  We'll take it down.
[03:39:04.400 --> 03:39:04.780]  What do you think?
[03:39:08.419 --> 03:39:09.480]  Sounds right.
[03:39:11.100 --> 03:39:12.301]  A lot of us got our shots in.
[03:39:12.601 --> 03:39:16.603]  Folks, we're coming up on the last 90 seconds of the show before we end this broadcast.
[03:39:16.643 --> 03:39:18.344]  A historic day, historic broadcast.
[03:39:18.404 --> 03:39:19.505]  Alex Jones did a great job.
[03:39:19.665 --> 03:39:22.787]  All of the speakers, especially Nick Sordor, did an outstanding job.
[03:39:22.807 --> 03:39:30.531]  It's such an honor and a privilege to be working at InfoWars during this historic time, not only in our nation's history, but in the history of humanity.
[03:39:30.551 --> 03:39:32.592]  And I truly do believe that
[03:39:34.346 --> 03:39:48.759]  This is the most important time in human history because not only do we have the power to eradicate the entire population with the weapons of mass destruction that we have, but we seem to actually be stoking and escalating that intentionally.
[03:39:49.199 --> 03:39:56.286]  And I think that this 2024 election is the most important election in the history of all elections or transitions of power ever to have happened.
[03:39:56.326 --> 03:39:59.328]  So please make it possible for InfoWars,
[03:40:00.149 --> 03:40:13.917]  And hosts like Alex Jones and Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and myself to broadcast the truth as we see it as far and wide as possible when freedom of speech needs to be protected and the truth needs to be protected more now than ever.
[03:40:13.957 --> 03:40:15.417]  So please go to Infowarsstore.com
[03:40:16.658 --> 03:40:22.760]  We've got a shirt, a bulletproof shirt that came out after the July 13th attempt on Donald Trump's life.
[03:40:23.400 --> 03:40:28.122]  Now is a great time to get this bulletproof shirt again at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:40:28.162 --> 03:40:37.604]  Not only has this man survived one assassination attempt on July 13th, but he's now survived a second assassination attempt on his life, apparently by the deep state.
[03:40:37.644 --> 03:40:43.006]  Please go to InfoWarsStore.com right now, get the shirt, get any of our supplements, and be the reason that we are still on the air.
[03:40:43.386 --> 03:40:45.827]  Save humanity from the globalists who are trying to take over.
[03:40:47.901 --> 03:40:56.604]  I got a great way for you to keep InfoWars on the air, and regardless what happens in InfoWars, keep me on the air, and that's TheAlexJonesStore.com, a new key URL for you to mark down.
[03:40:57.064 --> 03:41:00.385]  I've teamed up with the folks that make a lot of the top-selling Trump shirts in the country.
