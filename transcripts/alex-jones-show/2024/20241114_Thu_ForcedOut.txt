[00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.690]  They're turning off the internet.
[00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.009]  They're turning everything off here.
[00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.089]  And so that's in the process right now.
[00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.049]  M4s is turned off.
[00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.169]  Bandit video is turned off.
[00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:16.949]  And so there is a very good chance that we will be back here in the next few days as soon as the judge has an emergency hearing.
[00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.489]  And this will, this is what I believe is injustice and wrong will be upended.
[00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:27.019]  And so discretion is the greater part of valor.
[00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.920]  And so the feds that were here left.
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.600]  And when they heard Steve Bannon say, you know, go put cameras on them, that's not what I was going to do.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.460]  I wanted to go talk to them.
[00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:37.299]  I did talk to them over the phone.
[00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:43.939]  And they're going to Houston for the emergency hearing that the folks I was working with that put in real bids were just denied the process.
[00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.020]  They went and paid.
[00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:46.880]  They went and put down deposits.
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.679]  They did everything right.
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.219]  And then, nope, sorry, lower bid gets it.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.179]  And that's all coming out in court.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.380]  And if the judge wants to certify this, and that's what America is so far, we know that we've got to continue to work to restore our republic.
[00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.200]  But we've won.
[00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.719]  Trump's in.
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.380]  We're turning the tide.
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.060]  We haven't won the war.
[00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.920]  We've won the major battles.
[00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.319]  And so I just want to commend the crew.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:17.120]  I want to commend everybody for the hard work over the years that they have done.
[00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:31.769]  I want to thank the listeners and the viewers that over the years have fought so hard to keep us on air.
[00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.329]  This is not a victory for the bad guys.
[00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.269]  This is them being revealed.
[00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.469]  This is them being brought out in the open.
[00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.409]  This is the globalist tyranny being forced to take the mask off.
[00:01:46.129 --> 00:02:01.489]  And so, this will only backfire, that's 100% clear, Streisand Effect, because you are gonna take all my old clips, all our live shows, everything we do, and know that the system doesn't want you to have this because we are effectively bringing America back in a peaceful second American revolution.
[00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:25.360]  I ask that with your verdict, you not only take Alex Jones' platform that he talks about away, I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild the platform.
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.919]  That's what matters.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:39.099]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.770]  That is punishment.
[00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:44.050]  That is deterrence.
[00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.930]  But somewhere out there right now is another thing.
[00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.270]  Getting ready to bounce?
[00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.090]  Or will you stop it?
[00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.090]  That's going to be in your hands.
[00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.689]  And if we get all done with all the evidence, we're going to come back in your asses.
[00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:32.270]  Because that's what justice is in this case.
[00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.229]  I hope that we never see someone like him again.
[00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.889]  I hope that with your verdict he can go away.
[00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:55.710]  Alex Jones is patient zero for our society's inability to speak without lies.
[00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:57.990]  I believe it.
[00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.729]  He is patient zero for alternative facts.
[00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.590]  Yeah, there's gonna be a resolution made under what these claims are valued at.
[00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:14.710]  And that's also gonna have to take into account what the Lafferty claims are valued at, and the Posner claims are valued at, and the Fontaine claims are valued at.
[00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:24.759]  And that is why I've been saying that what this is heading towards Is there's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of Infowars and the bankruptcy estate.
[00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:28.579]  And over the course of that process, that could get very, very dangerous for Mr.
[00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.379]  Jones, because there is going to be a new level of financial scrutiny.
[00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:41.189]  You know, some lawyer like me can basically find out that he's hiding the keys to the candy store, pull it out in front of him on the stand.
[00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.949]  I can only imagine what federal receivers meant to.
[00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:59.149]  All right, and that was two years ago, and the federal receivers came in and found nothing wrong, and I got a $4.3 million tax return in the IRS audit because we'd overpaid taxes, and I had basically no assets, and that went into the bankruptcy and into the whole system.
[00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:05.149]  All right, so this could be the last minute of me on air out of these studios for the last 16 years.
[00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.750]  Infowars for 27 of it on air, 30 and a half years.
[00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.970]  Follow us right here at Real Alex Jones on X at AJN Live.
[00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.589]  Be sure to follow that at the Alex Jones Network.
[00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.430]  I'm going to sign off here.
[00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:36.649]  I'm not going to give away legal strategy, but what they did, and I've talked to the lawyers and what went on with the so-called auction and the way it was done and the fact that I knew it, they don't even deny it now, a lower bid was allowed to have the assets.
[00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.189]  No amount of money that we would have brought forward with our folks we're working with would have been there.
[00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.430]  And I told the crew that.
[00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.230]  I told them they would have a shutdown by Thursday morning.
[00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.389]  And so this was expected by me.
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.339]  And that's what this is.
[00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:54.500]  So, it's 1026, and I'm about to sign off here.
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.139]  We'll, you know, run some clips and things to, you know, fill up the time here.
[00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:12.759]  And then in about 20, you know, 33 minutes from now, if you're watching on the streams at Real Alex Jones and the streams at AJN Live, you will see me out of the new studio.
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.240]  The news desk, there's a bigger studio that's almost done there as well.
[00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:19.759]  And we've got backups on top of that with folks.
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.980]  Several people own it, run it.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.600]  They're going to try to get that, too.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.160]  It's not going to work.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.220]  And the Streisand effect is happening.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.259]  The system doesn't want you to know this information.
[00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:30.120]  So, they're turning off the internet.
[00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:31.439]  They're turning everything off here.
[00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:34.519]  And so, that's in process right now.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.459]  M4s is turned off.
[00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:36.600]  Bandit video is turned off.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.259]  And so...
[00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:45.389]  There is a very good chance that we will be back here in the next few days as soon as the judge has an emergency hearing.
[00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.910]  And this is what I believe is injustice and wrong will be upended.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.459]  And so discretion is the greater part of valor.
[00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.319]  And so the feds that were here left.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.040]  When they heard Steve Bannon say, you know, go put cameras on them, that's not what I was going to do.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.899]  I wanted to go talk to them.
[00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:05.740]  I did talk to them over the phone.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:12.339]  And they're going to Houston for the emergency hearing that the folks I was working with that put in real bids were just denied the process.
[00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:13.439]  They went and paid.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.319]  They went and put down deposits.
[00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:16.120]  They did everything right.
[00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:18.639]  And then, nope, sorry, lower bid gets it.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.600]  And that's all coming out in court.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:28.620]  So, and if the judge wants to certify this, and that's what America is so far, we know that we've got to, you know, continue to work to restore our republic, but we've won.
[00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:29.139]  Trump's in.
[00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:29.800]  We're turning the tide.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.500]  We haven't won the war.
[00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:31.360]  We've won the major battles.
[00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:35.759]  And so I just want to, you know, commend the crew.
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:45.639]  I want to, you know, commend everybody for the hard work over the years that they have done.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:08:00.209]  I want to thank The listeners and the viewers that over the years have fought so hard to keep us on air.
[00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.790]  This is not a victory for the bad guys.
[00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.709]  This is them being revealed.
[00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.910]  This is them being brought out in the open.
[00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:13.850]  This is the globalist tyranny being forced to take the mask off.
[00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:29.920]  And so, this will only backfire, that's 100% clear, Streisand Effect, because you are going to take all my old clips, all our live shows, everything we do, and know that the system doesn't want you to have this, because we are effectively bringing America back in a peaceful second American revolution.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:49.419]  So, I'm going to sign off here, and you'll find us, obviously, at alexjones.network, and realalexjones.com, and alexjones.live, and on X, at realalexjones, and at AJN Live, and then of course all the rest of the crew and host and people have their own great spaces there.
[00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:51.539]  Rumble Spaces, we'll see you at the Great Rumble.
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.639]  It's all happening right now.
[00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:59.759]  History is unfolding, and they wanted me off the air long before the election.
[00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:05.440]  They tried, they tried, but because you backed us, we stayed on air through seven years of lawfare, almost $80 million they filed in court.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.580]  They've spent trying to shut us up.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.220]  They admit it was never about money.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.860]  I didn't do any of the things they said I did.
[00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:11.000]  They had judges find me guilty.
[00:09:11.159 --> 00:09:11.659]  It was all a lie.
[00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.909]  And so we are victorious.
[00:09:14.149 --> 00:09:15.570]  That's why we're under attack.
[00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.830]  We're truthful.
[00:09:17.049 --> 00:09:17.429]  We're honorable.
[00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.330]  And our ancestors, I can guarantee you, are proud of us.
[00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.549]  And they're proud of all of you that have supported.
[00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:25.049]  So to continue on, please support our sponsor, thealexjohnstore.com.
[00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.289]  And of course, my dad's great supplement company, drjohnsdackles.com.
[00:09:28.429 --> 00:09:30.450]  And that will keep us in the fight.
[00:09:30.549 --> 00:09:31.330]  I will never surrender.
[00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.269]  I will never back down.
[00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.549]  It is impossible for me to quit.
[00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:39.639]  Especially in our moment of victory, as we see the deep state totally revealed.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.240]  But they thought shutting me down was going to work.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:50.000]  Now you got Elon Musk, basically a smarter, even better clone of my worldview, which is the real worldview of how things are actually going down.
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.580]  We are the future.
[00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:52.419]  We are the resistance.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.659]  And you got Joe Rogan totally awake and Tucker Carlson and just everybody else.
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:03.580]  So that meme of where I'm coming out of the tunnel and there's hundreds and hundreds of Alex Jones as the clones, it's here.
[00:10:03.919 --> 00:10:04.679]  It's happening.
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.940]  And so that's what it's all about.
[00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:14.840]  So now it's up to you, Paul Revere, to take the links, to follow RealAlexJonesOnX, at RealAlexJones, and at AJNLive.
[00:10:15.259 --> 00:10:26.179]  And it's up to you to make sure that this beachhead we had to take our country and the world back from the hands of the globalist, technocrat, transhumanist, satanist, pedophiles, will be successful.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.320]  So for myself, the entire InfoWars crew, for my family, we are all one family.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.259]  I love you, and I thank you.
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.100]  And our greatest work is ahead.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:46.419]  And in the final words, I will say here, of John Paul Jones, the founder of the U.S. Navy, when his ship, half the size of the British frigate, with more than double the troops and Marines on board, was sinking.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.019]  The British captain hailed across on the old-fashioned bullhorn.
[00:10:50.139 --> 00:10:51.440]  It wasn't electric, but threw a bullhorn.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.139]  Would you like to give up?
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:53.860]  Would you like quarter?
[00:10:54.019 --> 00:10:57.779]  And John Paul Jones said, I have not yet begun to fight.
[00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:00.539]  And that's in the Old English.
[00:11:00.539 --> 00:11:05.279]  I've only begun to fight in the common, popular, modern vernacular.
[00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:06.759]  Of English.
[00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:09.360]  And of course, as his ship sunk, he tied it to the British.
[00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:12.919]  They took the ship, saved both ships, and that's where you get.
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.960]  I've only begun to fight, and that's exactly what's happening.
[00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:21.299]  So my sinking ship is here, tied to the new ship, and a whole armada of ships is coming.
[00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:22.840]  It's the American people and people of the world.
[00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:24.679]  Global realignment against the New World Order.
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.700]  Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, they're in deep trouble.
[00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:29.840]  And so that which does not kill us only makes us stronger.
[00:11:30.159 --> 00:11:33.200]  So God bless you all, and the journey has just begun.
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:33.759]  Thank you.
[00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:40.919]  For years I've been telling you guys never to take no for an answer, right?
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:47.320]  You know, to keep pushing, to never hang up the phone until you get what you want.
[00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:50.120]  Because you all deserve it.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.539]  You know this f***ing deal that I'm about to sign?
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.080]  The f*** is that, you know?
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.659]  I'll tell you what it is.
[00:12:01.879 --> 00:12:06.000]  It's me taking no for an answer, you know?
[00:12:08.169 --> 00:12:11.409]  It's them selling me, not the other way around.
[00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:15.289]  It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.
[00:12:21.549 --> 00:12:21.950]  So...
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.139]  I'm not f***ing leaving!
[00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:54.379]  His show goes on!
[00:13:27.429 --> 00:13:31.830]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the big moment of truth is here.
[00:13:32.529 --> 00:13:36.570]  I'm taping this as an emergency message on Friday, November 8th in the evening.
[00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:50.529]  And in just a few days, next Wednesday, November 13th, by order of a federal judge, InfoWars is being sold to auction and the bad guys say they're going to buy it to turn it off and try to take me off air.
[00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:56.350]  Well, even if they shut down this building and take the website InfoWars away, I'm the Infowar.
[00:13:56.429 --> 00:13:57.250]  You're the Infowar.
[00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:58.409]  The crew is the Infowar.
[00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.210]  Our work is the Infowar.
[00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.570]  The globalist plan was deliberately trying to make us poorer.
[00:14:03.669 --> 00:14:04.110]  They admit that.
[00:14:04.169 --> 00:14:04.730]  The Great Reset.
[00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:08.750]  That's why just a few days after his president-elect, Bitcoin's way up.
[00:14:08.809 --> 00:14:09.690]  The stock market's way up.
[00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:15.149]  All these companies are announcing they're moving back to the US. Russia says they're not going to try to dethrone the dollar anymore.
[00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.730]  So now, it's more important than ever that we stay on air.
[00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:26.769]  And the only way we can stay on air In the face of all this tyranny is if you support us.
[00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:38.309]  So when you go to thealexjonesstore.com, incredible supplements, great Patriot apparel, amazing collectible knives, it's all there.
[00:14:38.789 --> 00:14:58.080]  But we've come out with three fundraiser items that are limited edition, That do have markup in them, so that instead of selling a t-shirt, and we end up making like 10 bucks on it, and it doesn't, at the end of the day, bring in enough funds, just like NPR will have a fundraiser to promote their communism and globalism,
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.740]  and a coffee cup probably costs them six, seven bucks.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.899]  When they sell it for 100, you know it's not worth that.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.879]  It's a fundraiser.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.779]  You're getting the memento that you supported their new order agenda.
[00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:11.950]  Well, you don't want to do that.
[00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:13.950]  You want to support what we're doing.
[00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:18.409]  So we have these three great limited edition posters.
[00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:25.210]  Two of them are about InfoWars and celebrating its history and what we've done, whether it survives or not.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.840]  And just remembering all we've gone through together and ensuring that we continue to fight on the future.
[00:15:30.039 --> 00:15:37.440]  And the other is an Alex Jones-style InfoWars crew, kind of Star Wars spoof spinoff.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.019]  And they're all great to hang in your office, great to hang in your house.
[00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:43.330]  They're limited edition.
[00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:44.590]  They're pieces of history.
[00:15:44.929 --> 00:15:50.669]  And so when you get them for $50, it costs us to print it and put it in the tube and all that like seven or eight bucks.
[00:15:50.929 --> 00:15:54.250]  We get some real funds in for operations.
[00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.850]  So I can tell you there's only a few thousand of each one of these posters.
[00:15:57.529 --> 00:16:04.389]  If you get them, I will have the funds to operate for a few months.
[00:16:05.429 --> 00:16:10.350]  As it stands right now, we've only got the funds to really get about a month or so launch.
[00:16:11.539 --> 00:16:12.759]  So I need your help.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.759]  Our work is the most important it's ever been right now.
[00:16:15.879 --> 00:16:16.759]  These are great posters.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.720]  I'm asking the Infowars family to stand with us.
[00:16:19.799 --> 00:16:22.240]  You've done so much in the past at this most critical of times.
[00:16:22.379 --> 00:16:26.480]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com and get one or more of these posters.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.460]  And I humbly, respectfully thank you for your support.
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.460]  But I gotta tell you, they are good-looking posters.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:39.419]  I mean, the Star Wars spinoff spoof is fun, but I designed the Infowars, red and white on black designs.
[00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:42.340]  One says 1776 worldwide.
[00:16:43.039 --> 00:16:46.179]  2024, Alex Jones with my signature.
[00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:48.600]  The other says Infowars lives forever with my signature.
[00:16:48.919 --> 00:16:51.080]  These are really great looking posters.
[00:16:51.299 --> 00:16:54.360]  They're iconic and the tyrants hate Infowars.
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.360]  They hate the idea of it.
[00:16:55.799 --> 00:16:57.200]  And it will live on regardless.
[00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:58.960]  So I thank those that have supported.
[00:16:59.179 --> 00:17:00.899]  I ask those that have supported to support again.
[00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:01.980]  And those that have been on the fence.
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.740]  Maybe you shared articles, videos, you're a fan.
[00:17:04.019 --> 00:17:04.900]  What are you doing?
[00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.420]  This is history happening.
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:07.920]  We're turning the tide.
[00:17:08.059 --> 00:17:08.799]  We have the initiative.
[00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:09.880]  We're starting to win.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.440]  We've won major battles, but not the war.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:19.720]  So go down to the AlexJonesStore.com and get one of these historic posters and keep us on the air one way or another.
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.039]  I thank you.
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.779]  And now I ask you to take action.
[00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:23.460]  God bless.
