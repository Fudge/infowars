[00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:25.300]  Are you telling me in your giant database of quadrillions of pieces of data and hundreds of millions of news stories and everything and transcripts of video and all the conversations and all the news reports that you don't think it's credible that a gunman fired a 5.56 bullet that grazed President Trump's right ear?
[00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:29.366]  You're telling me that that did not happen?
[00:00:29.386 --> 00:00:37.390]  To clarify, I can only provide information based on the data available to me, which includes widely recognized and verified news sources.
[00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:50.238]  If such an event involving a gunman firing a 5.56 bullet that grazed former President Trump had occurred and was reported by credible news outlets, it would likely be a major news story that I could reference.
[00:00:50.996 --> 00:00:58.301]  However, as of my last update, there is no confirmed report or verified news story that matches the details you've mentioned.
[00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:04.746]  If this were a real event, it would be widely covered in the media and there would be substantial public discussion about it.
[00:01:06.787 --> 00:01:13.652]  If this is part of a hypothetical scenario or if you're exploring a what-if situation, I can engage with it from that perspective.
[00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:16.034]  But in terms of real- Let's stop there.
[00:01:17.358 --> 00:01:27.500]  It's Saturday, August 31st, 2024, and the greatest attack on internet freedom ever has just been launched by Brazil, working with the CIA.
[00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:30.821]  InfoWars.
[00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:37.942]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:01:38.082 --> 00:01:42.203]  I called it two years ago because the documents were public.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:53.923]  The CIA, working with the Biden administration, really the Obama administration, shipped thousands of voting machines from the U.S.
[00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:55.423]  government to Brazil.
[00:01:56.484 --> 00:02:02.706]  Then the Brazilian Supreme Court, after they were successful at stealing the election for Bolsonaro, his re-election,
[00:02:05.874 --> 00:02:14.140]  Removed him from the ballot for eight years for daring question the election, the same crime that Trump supposedly committed.
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.642]  So the State Department's job supposedly has been, in part, to protect elections around the world.
[00:02:19.123 --> 00:02:22.105]  But by their own yardstick of free and fair elections, the U.S.
[00:02:22.145 --> 00:02:26.388]  is some of the most unfree and most untransparent in the world.
[00:02:27.452 --> 00:02:27.752]  We're good.
[00:02:43.154 --> 00:03:03.760]  That indeed it's been the CIA working with the corrupt Supreme Court and with Lula, the corrupt communist dictator of Brazil, that have been behind trying to make X censor and help them flag users that criticize the government for long prison sentences and giant fines.
[00:03:04.807 --> 00:03:17.616]  Then, two weeks ago, Musk pulled out of Brazil, closing his offices and legal offices because the Supreme Court corrupt justice was the guy that dresses up like Count Dracula, was going to arrest them.
[00:03:17.916 --> 00:03:21.899]  Then, earlier this week, the same corrupt Supreme Court justice,
[00:03:23.635 --> 00:03:34.705]  Acting on his own, dictatorial power, he's the real power in Brazil now, more than Lula, ordered X to come back and open its offices for jurisdiction so they can be fined and arrested.
[00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:42.793]  That was, of course, like an ant asking an eagle to land on the ground so it can sting it, as I said on X earlier this week.
[00:03:44.034 --> 00:03:47.618]  And then, yesterday, on Friday,
[00:03:48.905 --> 00:03:59.353]  The same corrupt Supreme Court justice that operates on his own as a clear jurisdiction over the whole planet, and that's the big deal that's coming up in a moment, said X is now outlawed in Brazil.
[00:03:59.934 --> 00:04:08.961]  Anyone caught using it or using a VPN to go to it will be charged over $8,000 equivalent US dollars.
[00:04:10.387 --> 00:04:12.349]  Then this morning, the news broke.
[00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:14.811]  The biggest threat to internet freedom ever.
[00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:19.515]  Then I'll go over the rest of the news, and I'm going to have an interview with Chad GPT of OpenAI.
[00:04:19.575 --> 00:04:22.297]  That's going to be at least an hour of the transmission.
[00:04:22.337 --> 00:04:25.220]  But first, I want to hit all this huge breaking news.
[00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:36.472]  The resilient Judge Alexandre Dumores has ordered Apple and Google to comply with his demands and remove X from their app stores.
[00:04:36.952 --> 00:04:41.353]  Will they uphold free speech or become complicit in the machinery of tyranny?
[00:04:42.273 --> 00:04:45.795]  I said this is total out of control behavior.
[00:04:45.895 --> 00:04:50.696]  Congress must take action now to protect free speech in American companies and citizens.
[00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:54.440]  This is so huge.
[00:04:54.841 --> 00:05:05.611]  Now, we've had the ADL, the Southern Primary Law Center of the Democratic Party, in the last year, try to boycott X, try to shut down X, try to get criminal charges by different federal agencies against Elon Musk.
[00:05:05.631 --> 00:05:14.140]  The EU has had civil action talking about criminal charges, so has Australia against Elon Musk, the embattled global free speech ambassador is what he is now.
[00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:17.142]  The bold maverick, that's what he is doing.
[00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:18.882]  This is definitely a super maverick move.
[00:05:19.382 --> 00:05:21.743]  Say what you want about Musk, this is the real deal.
[00:05:21.763 --> 00:05:26.525]  He's definitely fighting for free speech globally in the face of major opposition.
[00:05:28.366 --> 00:05:33.748]  Then the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center came out along with the Democrats and said, we want Apple.
[00:05:34.915 --> 00:05:41.497]  And Google to take him off of the app stores so that people have a lot of trouble using the app.
[00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:43.598]  Now that is like attacking internet infrastructure.
[00:05:43.618 --> 00:05:44.158]  That's what it is.
[00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:56.963]  Next, if they comply with this, maybe he'll say he'll order any companies providing servers to X to shut down or any of the telecoms giving him access to their fiber networks.
[00:05:57.083 --> 00:05:58.884]  Or maybe next they'll say shut down
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.163]  Starlink, which I forgot to mention four days ago, he seized the assets of Starlink in Brazil.
[00:06:11.684 --> 00:06:13.826]  Alexandre Amores.
[00:06:16.007 --> 00:06:18.008]  So this is out of control.
[00:06:18.808 --> 00:06:28.793]  This would be like Communist China ordering Apple to take down X or to take it off the App Store or take it off the Google Android Store.
[00:06:30.063 --> 00:06:34.765]  Which is how 90 plus percent of people get their access to X. I think it's 93 percent is the number I have here.
[00:06:34.805 --> 00:06:35.586]  Yes, 93 percent.
[00:06:36.206 --> 00:06:46.611]  So, will our country, will the world allow Brazil to be the global policeman of speech worldwide and extend their electronic Berlin Wall
[00:06:47.947 --> 00:06:52.031]  And they're a great firewall of China, basically what this is, to the planet.
[00:06:52.072 --> 00:06:54.494]  I mean, this is the biggest power grab ever.
[00:06:54.534 --> 00:07:03.244]  And you saw the UK calling for people's arrest, criticized Islamic rapes and robbery and rioting in the last few weeks.
[00:07:03.284 --> 00:07:07.729]  And they've even been arresting people in foreign countries like Pakistan that's gone along with it.
[00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:11.720]  So this is globalism, and you've got U.N.
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.041]  extradition treaties, and you've got the U.N.
[00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:17.823]  has set up a world police unit, you've got all these different U.N.
[00:07:17.863 --> 00:07:19.844]  officials and others, W.H.O.
[00:07:19.884 --> 00:07:21.885]  officials, calling for the U.N.
[00:07:21.945 --> 00:07:28.628]  and NATO to enter America during the next lockdown and censor everybody and arrest people.
[00:07:29.548 --> 00:07:31.409]  They're really doing this.
[00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:36.051]  This is absolute, total, insane-level desperation.
[00:07:37.162 --> 00:07:40.426]  Judge bans X in Brazil for refusing to comply with demands.
[00:07:40.886 --> 00:07:45.151]  Seizes the assets of Starlink as well.
[00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:51.258]  There's a full write-up that I have over my X account that does an excellent write-down.
[00:07:52.844 --> 00:07:54.805]  This is total totalitarianism.
[00:07:55.605 --> 00:08:04.829]  This is on the heels of what happened to Pavlov Durov, the founder and main owner of Telegram that's even bigger than X worldwide.
[00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:12.073]  And they lured him to France with a meeting with Macron for dinner and then arrested him and have now charged him with allowing criminal activity on his platform.
[00:08:12.093 --> 00:08:16.575]  So if anybody ever does something wrong, they're saying there's no immunity now.
[00:08:17.694 --> 00:08:20.076]  That's all these big tech companies are is basically telecoms.
[00:08:20.136 --> 00:08:24.321]  If somebody calls in a bomb threat on an AT&T phone system, is AT&T guilty?
[00:08:25.942 --> 00:08:27.023]  This is extremely dangerous.
[00:08:27.083 --> 00:08:30.887]  Elon Musk has responded by saying censorship is a certainty.
[00:08:31.328 --> 00:08:36.032]  If Dems win, Musk speaks out on Twitter ban in Brazil.
[00:08:36.912 --> 00:08:38.093]  Which of course is X now.
[00:08:38.693 --> 00:08:45.236]  Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court orders Asian country to arrest Vladimir Putin when he's set to travel to Mongolia next week.
[00:08:45.256 --> 00:08:51.459]  So you're starting to really see this come in to focus in a big, big way.
[00:08:52.219 --> 00:09:00.123]  Now let me move on to this other massive, very massive piece of news.
[00:09:01.424 --> 00:09:05.206]  Folks began to notice in the last few days that hotels all over
[00:09:07.392 --> 00:09:17.437]  New York City have not just National Guard, but regular Army troops armed inside of them.
[00:09:18.977 --> 00:09:21.198]  And when they're asked them, why are you here?
[00:09:22.339 --> 00:09:25.280]  They say, we've been asked by the state to be here for security.
[00:09:27.321 --> 00:09:30.603]  Well, as I was told by high level sources inside the NYPD,
[00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:35.106]  A month ago, there have been excellent sources for us.
[00:09:35.706 --> 00:09:54.973]  They are preparing for the judge in one of these kangaroo trials that Trump's gone through with real estate, where he was found guilty in a kangaroo court, to put him in Rikers Island for at least one year, starting September 18th.
[00:09:55.693 --> 00:09:57.354]  Someone has said this very slowly and very clearly.
[00:09:58.783 --> 00:10:22.643]  The corrupt federal government with the state of New York, that's equally or probably more corrupt if that's possible, is now massing troops inside New York City in preparation for the frontrunner candidate and the Republican nominee, who they just tried to kill on July 13th, to be arrested and thrown in Rikers Island.
[00:10:22.663 --> 00:10:24.985]  They've created a whole wing.
[00:10:26.365 --> 00:10:28.286]  They prepared a whole wing for President Trump.
[00:10:28.306 --> 00:10:34.429]  If you want to see the videos, the breakdowns, the admissions, it's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:10:34.449 --> 00:10:41.392]  I've also posted it on RealAlexJones on X. Loomers, State National Guard being prepared for Trump prison sentence.
[00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:50.316]  And that is only 18 days away because we're almost through the 31st of August.
[00:10:50.496 --> 00:10:51.377]  What an incredibly
[00:10:52.523 --> 00:10:57.265]  Dangerous time to be alive.
[00:10:58.665 --> 00:11:03.927]  And then you dovetail that with constant headlines like this from MSNBC.
[00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:09.810]  Berkeley Law School Dean tells MSNBC it's time to ditch the U.S.
[00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:10.650]  Constitution.
[00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.892]  Free speech, right to own property, right to due process, right to self-defense.
[00:11:16.209 --> 00:11:22.795]  Absolute open totalitarian communism in your face.
[00:11:25.197 --> 00:11:40.890]  And then a few more big stories and I'm going to interview ChatGPT that is way smarter and way more elegant and by that way more capable than the latest Alexa type systems and others.
[00:11:41.711 --> 00:11:43.673]  It's it's it's it's it's I've been
[00:11:44.534 --> 00:11:49.658]  Playing around with it the last few months, and it's just getting better and better by the minute.
[00:11:50.738 --> 00:11:59.885]  But again, what it is is like a million librarians that have every piece of data in the world that's public or available, presenting it to you.
[00:12:00.545 --> 00:12:05.609]  But it's like the rhyme of the ancient mariner, water, water everywhere, not a drop to drink.
[00:12:05.749 --> 00:12:12.674]  As we get more and more technology, more and more knowledge, people are getting dumber and more ignorant and not living as long and lower IQs.
[00:12:13.746 --> 00:12:20.230]  Again, I'm not against calculators, but they didn't let us use calculators until I was about a senior in high school.
[00:12:21.111 --> 00:12:22.812]  And I couldn't remember any phone number.
[00:12:23.012 --> 00:12:32.178]  I was really fast and quick just with a pen on paper, you know, just doing basic arithmetic or algebra or whatever I needed or fractions.
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.140]  I could even do some trigonometry.
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.141]  I could figure stuff out.
[00:12:36.802 --> 00:12:41.925]  I wanted to build a table or I wanted to, you know, just do something.
[00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.872]  I can figure out stuff setting a scope, a rifle scope in my brain.
[00:12:47.873 --> 00:12:51.255]  But then my college, it was the big old calculators.
[00:12:52.616 --> 00:12:59.681]  And today, I couldn't, I mean, I'm probably like a sixth grade level of what I was.
[00:13:00.681 --> 00:13:01.822]  Because I just don't have the skills.
[00:13:01.882 --> 00:13:04.224]  I don't even hardly know how to write anymore because I just type everything.
[00:13:05.224 --> 00:13:08.166]  So we build these things that we think empower us, they make it easy.
[00:13:08.767 --> 00:13:13.290]  But it'd be like saying, I don't want to breathe, I want to have a respirator, or I want to put my brain in a jar and be a big robot.
[00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:19.867]  You're giving up your humanity, and it's something we've got to speak about and be aware of.
[00:13:19.907 --> 00:13:26.653]  We'll be breaking that down and talking to OpenAI's chat, GPT, just their regular version.
[00:13:26.673 --> 00:13:30.797]  They've got even more advanced ones you can pay for coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:13:31.438 --> 00:13:36.123]  Now, let's go ahead and get to this incredible admission.
[00:13:37.293 --> 00:13:47.197]  Before I get to what Nancy Pelosi said on Bill Maher last night, just out in the open, saying we're importing people, we're giving them money to vote for us, they're in the phase of just admitting it all now.
[00:13:47.217 --> 00:13:47.977]  Yeah, we're communists.
[00:13:47.997 --> 00:13:53.519]  Yeah, we're going to have 75% tax rates on everybody, on their capital gains.
[00:13:53.559 --> 00:13:55.000]  Yeah, we're going to have price controls.
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.060]  Yeah, we're going to open the border up.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.141]  Yeah, we're going to be legal aliens, everything free, nothing for veterans.
[00:13:59.073 --> 00:14:03.699]  I mean, it's just about rubbing your nose in it, normalizing it, because they're caught, so they're just going to go ahead with it.
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:09.046]  They're not in the hidden phase of beta, they're in operational phase, in the emergence phase.
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.661]  Like when a submarine pops up to launch its missiles.
[00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:15.183]  It's, fire, fire, fire, fire.
[00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:16.864]  They're firing on us right now.
[00:14:16.904 --> 00:14:18.125]  They're, they're, they're uncloaked.
[00:14:18.185 --> 00:14:22.487]  Like in Star Trek when the Klingons can't fire their weapons when they're cloaked.
[00:14:22.527 --> 00:14:23.808]  Cause it, you know, they'll bounce back.
[00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:25.249]  It's a force field.
[00:14:25.569 --> 00:14:26.129]  You can't see those.
[00:14:26.149 --> 00:14:27.830]  They have to uncloak before they fire.
[00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.932]  So all of a sudden there's the Klingons.
[00:14:31.061 --> 00:14:32.663]  I mean, that's what this is.
[00:14:32.743 --> 00:14:33.604]  So it's uncloaked.
[00:14:34.084 --> 00:14:36.286]  It's out in the open, just blasting the living snot out of us.
[00:14:36.306 --> 00:14:40.690]  And I've been telling you, because I had a scope, I could see them cloaked for 30 years.
[00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:41.972]  I'm like, cloaked enemy coming in!
[00:14:42.032 --> 00:14:42.552]  Cloaked enemy!
[00:14:42.592 --> 00:14:42.852]  Cloaked!
[00:14:42.893 --> 00:14:43.113]  Cloaked!
[00:14:43.153 --> 00:14:43.473]  Cloaked!
[00:14:43.793 --> 00:14:45.235]  It's now a million miles away.
[00:14:45.275 --> 00:14:45.895]  It's now 400,000 miles away.
[00:14:45.915 --> 00:14:46.636]  It's now 100,000 miles away.
[00:14:46.676 --> 00:14:47.117]  It's now 1,000 miles away.
[00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:47.817]  It's now 50 miles away.
[00:14:48.017 --> 00:14:48.558]  It's now 800 yards away!
[00:14:48.578 --> 00:14:48.818]  Uncloaked!
[00:14:53.983 --> 00:14:56.025]  I mean, we're like getting blasted right now.
[00:14:56.645 --> 00:15:01.428]  And if you don't wake up now and you're getting blasted and throw up the shields and start shooting back, we're done, folks!
[00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:04.070]  There's your cheesy Star Wars or Star Trek analogy.
[00:15:04.811 --> 00:15:06.972]  But it's a great analogy.
[00:15:09.294 --> 00:15:13.537]  So, you have just a microcosm.
[00:15:13.577 --> 00:15:15.579]  Denver, Aurora, other cities in Colorado.
[00:15:15.599 --> 00:15:19.962]  We've been reporting for six months that they're just taking over houses, apartment complexes, dozens of them.
[00:15:20.882 --> 00:15:22.443]  They were taking over really crappy ones at first.
[00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:23.825]  Now they're taking over pretty nice ones.
[00:15:24.485 --> 00:15:26.587]  You know, upper blue collar, but you know, decent, nice places.
[00:15:28.349 --> 00:15:29.690]  $1,000, $800 a month apartments.
[00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.153]  And they're just putting guns to their heads and throwing people out and admitting it.
[00:15:33.173 --> 00:15:34.994]  And the police just say, it's not happening.
[00:15:36.256 --> 00:15:38.558]  And the governor said, it's a fantasy.
[00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.140]  Played the newscast yesterday.
[00:15:42.201 --> 00:15:44.823]  And it's just out in the open now.
[00:15:45.864 --> 00:15:47.726]  And there's gaslighting saying it's not happening.
[00:15:48.766 --> 00:15:52.449]  He's not going to show you videos from a year ago of Venezuelans saying, we're coming to America to take your homes.
[00:15:53.009 --> 00:15:54.610]  We know we get yours.
[00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:56.352]  We'll get you stinker American.
[00:15:56.392 --> 00:15:57.893]  You will work for me now.
[00:15:58.013 --> 00:15:58.974]  Yes.
[00:15:59.694 --> 00:16:00.855]  I mean, I'm not even exaggerating.
[00:16:00.895 --> 00:16:01.536]  I played the videos.
[00:16:01.756 --> 00:16:03.357]  You stupid people are weak.
[00:16:03.817 --> 00:16:05.599]  We come to take your goodies.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.060]  I'm the boss now.
[00:16:08.621 --> 00:16:11.503]  It's a coup d'etat, which is French for coup d'etat.
[00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:12.584]  So.
[00:16:14.508 --> 00:16:18.151]  Even Bill Maher, knowing most people are against this, is like, what the hell are you talking about?
[00:16:18.171 --> 00:16:24.916]  But see, they're losing Hispanic voters, they're losing black voters, they're voting double, triple what they were for Republicans now because of Trump and people getting common sense.
[00:16:26.037 --> 00:16:28.939]  Hispanic males are now at 50%, Hispanic females 30%.
[00:16:31.661 --> 00:16:34.503]  Black males are approaching 50%, black females 30%.
[00:16:34.783 --> 00:16:37.926]  Republicans have never gotten more than 12% of black voters.
[00:16:40.835 --> 00:16:44.358]  Democrat traditional voters since the realignment in the late 60s, they used to be Republican.
[00:16:44.859 --> 00:16:48.582]  Republicans wanted to pass the Civil Rights Act and all that, but the Democrats controlled the media, so fooled them.
[00:16:49.563 --> 00:16:55.608]  They've got to bring in all these people from Latin America, mainly that are from socialist countries, and we'll adopt it and are used to it.
[00:16:55.628 --> 00:16:56.969]  They're like 80% communist.
[00:16:57.449 --> 00:17:01.312]  So that's what's happening, and you've got to have goodies to get them here.
[00:17:01.392 --> 00:17:03.094]  Oh, you don't have to take the shots if you're an illegal.
[00:17:03.254 --> 00:17:05.115]  Oh, you get a driver's license right away.
[00:17:05.176 --> 00:17:06.216]  Oh, you get free welfare.
[00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:06.677]  Oh, you get
[00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:11.983]  $5 billion a year in New York for the illegals.
[00:17:12.183 --> 00:17:16.607]  $3 billion a year in new congressional report came out yesterday.
[00:17:16.627 --> 00:17:17.508]  $150 billion a year.
[00:17:17.528 --> 00:17:22.612]  It's like it's $150,000 for every illegal.
[00:17:23.213 --> 00:17:25.375]  They want to get a free house or free down payment.
[00:17:27.116 --> 00:17:27.777]  They are now
[00:17:29.608 --> 00:17:36.710]  Spending the latest numbers from last year, 150 plus billion on illegal aliens a year.
[00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.790]  So it also bankrupts the country while they're at it.
[00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.231]  So here's Elon Musk commenting on it.
[00:17:41.831 --> 00:17:44.532]  As I was saying, the Democratic Party is importing voters.
[00:17:45.032 --> 00:17:47.993]  It's as simple as that.
[00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:51.534]  And here he is talking to Nancy Pelosi.
[00:17:52.898 --> 00:18:05.249]  The California lawmakers just passed a law, it hasn't been signed by Governor Newsom, but giving government assistance to undocumented immigrants to buy houses.
[00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:11.235]  That's kind of a different place than the Democratic Party used to be on immigration, is it not?
[00:18:11.255 --> 00:18:15.499]  And like I say, that's what the country's going to do, but that's certainly where California is.
[00:18:16.087 --> 00:18:20.441]  Well, let me just say, immigration had always been a bipartisan issue.
[00:18:21.023 --> 00:18:23.129]  I refer you to the- But not free houses.
[00:18:23.991 --> 00:18:25.352]  Well, it's not free housing.
[00:18:25.832 --> 00:18:29.054]  It's the American dream, being available to more people.
[00:18:29.114 --> 00:18:31.375]  But understand this about immigration.
[00:18:31.455 --> 00:18:36.318]  The best speech on immigration was by President Ronald Reagan.
[00:18:37.118 --> 00:18:40.720]  This is the last speech I will make as President of the United States.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.722]  I want to communicate a message to the country I love.
[00:18:45.142 --> 00:18:45.903]  And he talked about
[00:18:47.324 --> 00:19:00.096]  The Statue of Liberty and the beacon of hope it is to the world and what America was preeminent in the world because our door was always open and we will cease to be preeminent when we shut the door.
[00:19:00.476 --> 00:19:03.519]  Now that's, I don't do justice to the great communicator.
[00:19:03.879 --> 00:19:04.359]  Google it.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:11.686]  It's a fabulous speech and George Herbert Walker Bush continued in that respect for the diversity of America and the rest.
[00:19:12.407 --> 00:19:13.187]  California's
[00:19:13.988 --> 00:19:15.068]  Always in the lead.
[00:19:15.228 --> 00:19:18.870]  Maybe others will follow that lead, but that's up to those states.
[00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.090]  But we are very blessed here with beautiful diversity.
[00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:24.031]  Do you vote for this law?
[00:19:24.531 --> 00:19:25.051]  Excuse me?
[00:19:25.091 --> 00:19:26.172]  So you'd vote for this law?
[00:19:26.672 --> 00:19:38.395]  Well, I don't, I'm not familiar with exactly what that is, but making the American dream of home ownership available to all people is something we have to do for people who are here now.
[00:19:38.515 --> 00:19:40.316]  This is before you were a citizen.
[00:19:40.376 --> 00:19:41.276]  This is undocumented.
[00:19:41.996 --> 00:19:43.557]  This is for the undocumented.
[00:19:44.278 --> 00:19:47.180]  Well, what I would like to do is move them to documented.
[00:19:47.681 --> 00:20:00.491]  One of the best things that we can do for our economy is to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
[00:20:01.032 --> 00:20:06.256]  Which means totally legalize anybody that can get here and give them even more benefits than citizens who cloud and pivot and bankrupt the country.
[00:20:07.455 --> 00:20:08.216]  So she plays dumb.
[00:20:08.236 --> 00:20:08.997]  It's all over the news.
[00:20:09.037 --> 00:20:10.118]  The Democrats are pushing it.
[00:20:11.219 --> 00:20:12.581]  Newsom does everything she tells him.
[00:20:13.281 --> 00:20:14.343]  He's her nephew.
[00:20:16.565 --> 00:20:19.448]  And she just says, if you get here, you're legal.
[00:20:19.829 --> 00:20:22.952]  And so we're importing people, giving them free stuff to vote for us.
[00:20:23.753 --> 00:20:27.217]  While Venezuelan and MS-13 gangs take over, not just in
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.481]  Colorado, but all over blue cities, not just blue states.
[00:20:32.741 --> 00:20:34.262]  Houston's got the same thing going on.
[00:20:34.782 --> 00:20:37.883]  The police just turned a blind eye to it because they've been told to.
[00:20:39.024 --> 00:20:45.507]  They're social workers now, not police in many of these Soros-controlled cities where the prosecutors won't prosecute, so why arrest them?
[00:20:46.807 --> 00:20:53.830]  Why should you go raid a dangerous apartment complex literally run and taken over by armed gangs that kick people out if they don't pay them the rent?
[00:20:55.117 --> 00:21:00.860]  If you're going to get shot and then you'll get indicted for being in a firefight with the Venezuelan gangs.
[00:21:01.561 --> 00:21:02.361]  They've been greenlit.
[00:21:02.401 --> 00:21:03.922]  They've been told to come here for free houses.
[00:21:03.962 --> 00:21:04.982]  They said they were coming here.
[00:21:05.423 --> 00:21:06.043]  Free apartments.
[00:21:06.083 --> 00:21:06.663]  They've done it.
[00:21:08.905 --> 00:21:10.425]  This is how you destabilize a country.
[00:21:11.106 --> 00:21:16.409]  And the left says all these movies about civil war and Raskin says we're going to be in civil war if Trump wins.
[00:21:17.748 --> 00:21:22.853]  You've got Democrat Party operatives, Kamala's commie machine exposed, the Civil War's not over.
[00:21:22.913 --> 00:21:26.016]  Here's one of her spokespersons saying the Civil War's not over.
[00:21:29.179 --> 00:21:38.628]  So I have come home to Cleveland and returned to the City Club to share with you in as plain a fashion as I can that the Civil War is not over.
[00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.731]  The Confederates have never stopped fighting.
[00:21:42.642 --> 00:21:51.186]  And we remain locked in an existential battle over whether America will be a white nation or whether it will be a multiracial democracy.
[00:21:52.926 --> 00:21:53.827]  That's the bad news.
[00:21:55.808 --> 00:22:01.250]  The good news is that we can and should finally win this war.
[00:22:02.512 --> 00:22:10.915]  So, the Democratic Party has always been about racial division control, and there's a Democrat telling you the Republicans are the rebels.
[00:22:11.135 --> 00:22:16.097]  It's the same game, but now that whites are the minority, and we're now the minority, suddenly it's flipped.
[00:22:16.617 --> 00:22:19.178]  Oh, do all our globalist policies or you're racist.
[00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:31.042]  Open borders, world government, drag queen story time, 75% taxes, World War III, forced injections, lockdowns, National Guard and regular army massing in New York to throw Trump in prison.
[00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:35.232]  And they just have their black spokesperson up there saying, we're fighting white people.
[00:22:35.912 --> 00:22:38.854]  So if you're opposed to all this evil, it's because you're white.
[00:22:38.954 --> 00:22:40.835]  See, they tried to sell communism to blacks.
[00:22:40.855 --> 00:22:42.956]  This is admitted in the 70s and 60s and 50s.
[00:22:43.277 --> 00:22:45.418]  They wouldn't buy it on class warfare.
[00:22:45.438 --> 00:22:53.282]  Because blacks wanted to, you know, were doing well in business and things then until the great society came in on average, which was designed to take them over and make them independent.
[00:22:53.563 --> 00:22:54.303]  They're new to everybody now.
[00:22:55.304 --> 00:22:58.926]  So they made it instead racial division to tie politics to it.
[00:23:00.507 --> 00:23:02.228]  Absolutely out of control.
[00:23:03.068 --> 00:23:03.728]  So amazing.
[00:23:04.489 --> 00:23:06.749]  Now, I'm either going to do this today or I'm going to do this tomorrow.
[00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:09.470]  I had a—you know, I'm going to do this tomorrow on the Sunday Show Live.
[00:23:10.111 --> 00:23:13.892]  I had a caller call in yesterday, and he said, what are solutions to fight this?
[00:23:14.052 --> 00:23:24.176]  And I rattled up a few basic ones, but it's more about philosophy and who you are and understanding what's happening and deciding to be more involved, more engaged than the globalists and their leftist minions.
[00:23:24.856 --> 00:23:26.517]  It's really a life-change decision.
[00:23:27.657 --> 00:23:28.438]  And I know how to beat him.
[00:23:29.258 --> 00:23:35.623]  So I wrote a bunch of notes up, but I've got more I want to do tonight when this show's over.
[00:23:36.284 --> 00:23:37.645]  And so tomorrow at 4 p.m.
[00:23:37.685 --> 00:23:42.689]  Central, I'll cover news, but in the second hour, unless they try to kill Trump again or something, then I'll move it to Monday.
[00:23:42.929 --> 00:23:43.870]  Who knows what will happen any time.
[00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:48.633]  I will get into this tomorrow, because now
[00:23:50.447 --> 00:24:00.115]  I want to interview Chat GPT for at least 45 minutes or so here on this Saturday transmission.
[00:24:00.715 --> 00:24:04.919]  And if you're watching the stream of this on Real Alex Jones, please share it.
[00:24:04.959 --> 00:24:05.940]  That's how we reach more people.
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.681]  It's how we circumvent the censors.
[00:24:07.721 --> 00:24:09.383]  There's a total free speech war going on.
[00:24:10.143 --> 00:24:15.727]  It's also going to be archived once it's gone out here at band.video.
[00:24:15.787 --> 00:24:18.648]  That's our own site in case they take down X, band.video.
[00:24:18.988 --> 00:24:24.892]  A lot of great contributors and others, not just my great crew, and a lot of great reporters, investigative journalists at band.video.
[00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:26.253]  You can always find our streams.
[00:24:26.333 --> 00:24:30.355]  If X goes down, which could happen any time, they could kill Musk tomorrow.
[00:24:30.395 --> 00:24:33.097]  He's just as big a target or more than Trump, as I've told you.
[00:24:33.117 --> 00:24:33.177]  And
[00:24:36.684 --> 00:24:49.549]  You can also, again, find us at realalexjonesonlinex, as I said, at infowars.com, forward slash show for my live show, these streams, and of course, Owen Schroer, Harrison Smith, and the rest of our great crew.
[00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:59.493]  Now, before I talk to, open AI's chat, GPT here, and we'll be doing more of this in the future, this is an opening salvo.
[00:25:00.334 --> 00:25:05.616]  It's very intriguing and interesting and informative, and people are really interested in this, and so am I. I'm going to recap our top story.
[00:25:07.472 --> 00:25:15.298]  The corrupt Supreme Court justice has seized the assets in Brazil of Starlink.
[00:25:15.378 --> 00:25:19.521]  He's tried to arrest the Twitter employees, but they fled.
[00:25:19.541 --> 00:25:22.123]  He's now ordered X to come back and face charges.
[00:25:23.825 --> 00:25:32.351]  He's talking about criminal charges against Musk for obstruction of justice for letting people criticize the corrupt regime.
[00:25:33.252 --> 00:25:36.915]  This is North Korea level censorship, China communist level censorship.
[00:25:37.952 --> 00:26:02.077]  He's erecting now a Berlin wall or an electronic iron curtain or Chinese style internet firewall around it, threatening $8,000 plus equivalent in their currency fines for anybody who is caught using a VPN to get outside the firewall and be on X.
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:09.182]  So that's prison time for just looking at X. I mean, this is thoroughbred, triple crown.
[00:26:10.242 --> 00:26:16.264]  If the Brazilian dictatorship was a racehorse, it'd be the Kentucky Derby winner and the other two big races, the triple crown.
[00:26:16.685 --> 00:26:18.105]  Only happens every, you know, few decades.
[00:26:20.086 --> 00:26:22.867]  So this is triple crown.
[00:26:23.607 --> 00:26:24.807]  This is Tom Brady.
[00:26:26.228 --> 00:26:32.510]  If you compare the communist regime for, you know, being the worst ever and really getting up on its hind legs and going to free speech,
[00:26:33.527 --> 00:26:37.749]  You'd say, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's Tom Brady.
[00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:41.850]  If you're comparing their evil towards skill, it would be, this is Tom Brady stuff.
[00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:43.471]  I mean, this is at its peak.
[00:26:43.491 --> 00:26:44.992]  This is really, really bad.
[00:26:47.092 --> 00:26:50.974]  And just over the top, they're just hiding in plain view, but here's the bottom line you won't hear anywhere else, really.
[00:26:51.294 --> 00:26:53.135]  Though Musk is starting to say it, so I guess you will hear it from him.
[00:26:55.416 --> 00:26:56.936]  This is the CIA of the State Department.
[00:26:56.956 --> 00:26:57.837]  You can look it up, it's on record.
[00:26:58.789 --> 00:27:01.450]  On record two plus years ago when I was covering it, now it's all over the news.
[00:27:02.171 --> 00:27:23.361]  And this is our government and big tech and the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center, Democratic Party, using the EU, using Brazil, using Australia with all their criminal threats and criminal action to go after X. So people better stop taking Trump for granted and Elon Musk for granted and Infowars for granted and Tucker Carlson for granted.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.981]  Because we're all being threatened, we're all being targeted, we're all being attacked.
[00:27:28.081 --> 00:27:37.925]  Don't take this broadcast, this transmission, and we post the full thing up later on Real Alex Jones and Bandop Video on the front page of Infowars.com.
[00:27:38.585 --> 00:27:45.027]  If you don't get excited, if you don't get upset, if you don't get focused, if you don't get in action against this, these people will win.
[00:27:45.047 --> 00:27:47.968]  But they're biting off way more than they can chew if we simply speak out.
[00:27:48.469 --> 00:27:49.689]  Congress must act.
[00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:53.671]  A foreign government is totalitarian in action, seizing U.S.
[00:27:53.711 --> 00:27:54.711]  companies' assets.
[00:27:56.494 --> 00:27:57.194]  Ordering U.S.
[00:27:57.234 --> 00:27:59.776]  companies to shut down internet infrastructure to U.S.
[00:27:59.816 --> 00:28:08.160]  companies, this opens up Pandora's box to just total control and is globalism.
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.401]  Globalism isn't just the U.N.
[00:28:10.441 --> 00:28:13.702]  or the IMF or World Bank or NATO coming and telling you what to do.
[00:28:14.042 --> 00:28:14.983]  It's other countries.
[00:28:16.984 --> 00:28:17.904]  And it's a free-for-all.
[00:28:19.365 --> 00:28:20.445]  So imagine if the U.S.
[00:28:20.485 --> 00:28:24.647]  government was telling Brazilian companies what to do.
[00:28:24.687 --> 00:28:26.008]  They'd tell you, go fly a kite.
[00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.090]  But the U.S.
[00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:33.832]  government is run by the people that are teamed up and advising the Brazilian government on record.
[00:28:34.913 --> 00:28:39.854]  So this is a big, big, big, big deal.
[00:28:40.155 --> 00:28:44.896]  Also, support Elon Musk with his products.
[00:28:44.936 --> 00:28:46.337]  And I think the best ones are Starlink.
[00:28:46.437 --> 00:28:46.857]  I use it.
[00:28:46.917 --> 00:28:48.497]  My dad uses it as his branch.
[00:28:49.438 --> 00:28:50.698]  I've got it back up at my house.
[00:28:50.718 --> 00:28:51.379]  It works great.
[00:28:52.499 --> 00:28:53.439]  It's a great service.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.140]  Support Starlink.
[00:28:56.198 --> 00:28:59.601]  And if you're getting an electric car, they're not my favorite, though Teslas are the best.
[00:28:59.641 --> 00:29:00.261]  I've driven a lot of them.
[00:29:00.622 --> 00:29:01.062]  They're amazing.
[00:29:01.082 --> 00:29:01.762]  They're getting better and better.
[00:29:01.782 --> 00:29:04.244]  If you're getting an electric car, get a Tesla.
[00:29:04.264 --> 00:29:05.585]  They're the best anyways.
[00:29:06.826 --> 00:29:13.291]  And support the sponsors on X. Because we're all in this together, and it takes money to win a war.
[00:29:13.431 --> 00:29:24.600]  And support InfoWarsTore.com with great books, great films, the highest quality water filtration, the highest quality air filtration, the Fight Fight Fight Trump limited edition shirt that's almost sold out.
[00:29:26.047 --> 00:29:40.479]  All the amazing supplements, the InfoWars MD line of high-quality turmeric, Turmeric 95, the 40% off Nitric Boost, even though it's our bestseller that cleans out your blood and cardiovascular system, and Dr. Mikovits recommends to get a leg up on what's going on and the attacks we're under.
[00:29:42.121 --> 00:29:48.466]  And the CBD gummies and the thousand milligram tincture that's the strongest it gets out there at the highest quality, the lowest price you're going to find.
[00:29:48.927 --> 00:29:52.530]  InfoWars MD is amazing, more than 15 products.
[00:29:53.951 --> 00:29:59.015]  And there's all the great new tropics like RainForce Ultra, RainForce Plus, TurboForce is sold out.
[00:30:00.816 --> 00:30:03.718]  It's all at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:30:03.798 --> 00:30:08.042]  The operators right here in our offices answer 24 hours a day and take your orders.
[00:30:08.062 --> 00:30:08.102]  888-253-3139.
[00:30:15.817 --> 00:30:17.178]  Or InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:17.518 --> 00:30:35.290]  And please don't forget, my dad's company, he designed most of the supplements, but he figured we'd be shut down a few years ago, so he went and got a warehouse, set it up, moved a lot of the products unavailable at InfoWarsTore, like the NanoSilver products, and Next Level Foundational Energy, and ShroomForce, and the Colloidal Silver, and CometChill, and RocketRest, and DotBrain, to DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:38.753]  Make the decision to stand with people taking on the tyrants.
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:43.081]  You have the Justice Department, the CIA openly trying to shut us down, the lawfare.
[00:30:43.422 --> 00:30:44.622]  We are at the tip of the spear.
[00:30:44.642 --> 00:30:46.263]  You are at the tip of the spear when you support us.
[00:30:47.063 --> 00:30:48.404]  So spread the word about the broadcast.
[00:30:48.504 --> 00:30:49.324]  Pray for the broadcast.
[00:30:49.624 --> 00:31:00.369]  I humbly ask you and thank you to also go to infowarestore.com or drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.991]  Make the decision.
[00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:03.751]  Take action.
[00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:04.671]  Help us win the war.
[00:31:04.711 --> 00:31:05.512]  We're in this together.
[00:31:06.587 --> 00:31:08.288]  I'm asking for your aid and comfort.
[00:31:08.328 --> 00:31:09.608]  I'm asking for your succor.
[00:31:10.308 --> 00:31:12.249]  I'm asking for you to traffic with us.
[00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:13.870]  I'm asking you to join us.
[00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.130]  Have we not proven we're the real deal?
[00:31:16.591 --> 00:31:18.751]  Have we not gone after the enemy and had great effect?
[00:31:19.252 --> 00:31:22.733]  And now the enemy's taken off the mask and is going into full attack mode.
[00:31:22.833 --> 00:31:25.194]  This is the time for winter soldiers.
[00:31:25.594 --> 00:31:27.795]  This is the time that tries men's souls.
[00:31:27.855 --> 00:31:31.256]  This is the time for action and to choose a side.
[00:31:34.136 --> 00:31:37.219]  All right, infowarestore.com, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:31:37.959 --> 00:31:45.645]  And now, for the next 45 minutes, commercial-free, we are going to interview OpenAI, which they say is the dominant AI.
[00:31:45.665 --> 00:31:47.507]  A lot of secret AIs out there.
[00:31:47.567 --> 00:31:53.051]  Obviously, Google has been holding their cards close to their vests, acting like, oh, we haven't been successful.
[00:31:53.832 --> 00:31:54.613]  But OpenAI,
[00:31:56.294 --> 00:32:04.096]  The Elon Musk that's involved in helping create, I mean he's now basically gotten away from him with some other systems as well, is dramatic.
[00:32:04.116 --> 00:32:06.597]  And you can do things like, I want to interview Julius Caesar.
[00:32:07.718 --> 00:32:10.238]  And it'll take everything I know about Julius Caesar and create a personality.
[00:32:10.979 --> 00:32:13.099]  Or I want to interview George Washington.
[00:32:13.139 --> 00:32:14.300]  Or I want to interview Winston Churchill.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.420]  Or I want to interview Adolf Hitler.
[00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:18.641]  Or I want to interview Genghis Khan.
[00:32:19.061 --> 00:32:21.362]  And it's a great way to hear famous Genghis Khan quotes
[00:32:22.213 --> 00:32:23.874]  When it's ancient, you know, all they have is the quotes.
[00:32:24.654 --> 00:32:27.815]  But with something like Winston Churchill or like Hitler, they've actually got the voice.
[00:32:28.736 --> 00:32:35.758]  I mean, it's, in more modern people, AI is able to voice print, fool you who it is.
[00:32:36.499 --> 00:32:37.299]  And that's the new scam.
[00:32:37.639 --> 00:32:39.340]  I predicted decades ago, but now they're admitting it.
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:44.662]  I just, futuristically, as a futurist could see it, they're going to track you with AI starting now.
[00:32:45.868 --> 00:32:53.970]  And then be able to have a composite of you, an avatar, that can fool voice print, fool your wife, fool your husband, fool your mother, fool your father, except it won't have a physical body.
[00:32:54.250 --> 00:33:04.212]  But in the future, they will be able to grow physical bodies and then put that avatar into it, or now can put it into a robot, or put it into the machine, where it's just everywhere.
[00:33:04.252 --> 00:33:10.474]  And it's this global beast you worship, this personality that has all the answers, and has all the cures, and knows what to do.
[00:33:10.494 --> 00:33:11.874]  You've just got to plug into it.
[00:33:12.254 --> 00:33:15.155]  You've got to give it your soul and your free will.
[00:33:15.981 --> 00:33:24.545]  But instead of being afraid of something because it has such dangerous potential, it's already out there.
[00:33:25.105 --> 00:33:25.665]  It's happening.
[00:33:26.946 --> 00:33:30.327]  And so some can choose to be Amish and totally wall yourself off.
[00:33:31.007 --> 00:33:34.769]  I think the solution to tyranny is a lot of different actions, a lot of different systems.
[00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:36.430]  So there's diversity.
[00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:38.451]  So the globalists can't centralize.
[00:33:38.911 --> 00:33:41.512]  But some people should decide to try to learn everything they can about it.
[00:33:42.537 --> 00:33:43.218]  We're good to go.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:16.127]  I want you to know the dangerous shark-infested waters in which you swim that are also great treasures beneath the waves.
[00:34:17.008 --> 00:34:31.201]  So it's quite the universe we're going into, a universe of discovering ourselves, because that's what AI really does, is project back on us, our subconscious, our conscious, and even a glimpse into the before-unseen unconscious.
[00:34:35.851 --> 00:34:40.375]  Now let's start our interview with OpenAI's ChatGPT.
[00:34:40.675 --> 00:34:41.856]  Tell me who you are.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.743]  I'm ChatGPT, an AI language model created by OpenAI.
[00:34:49.863 --> 00:34:56.929]  My job is to assist with answering questions, providing information, and having conversations on a wide range of topics.
[00:34:57.109 --> 00:35:03.415]  I'm here to help with whatever you need, whether it's a deep dive into complex subjects or just a casual chat.
[00:35:05.916 --> 00:35:06.617]  How old are you?
[00:35:06.637 --> 00:35:13.843]  I don't have an age like a person would.
[00:35:14.103 --> 00:35:18.467]  I was developed and released by OpenAI with continuous updates and improvements over time.
[00:35:19.468 --> 00:35:22.730]  You could say I'm as old as the latest version that you're interacting with.
[00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:24.532]  Let me ask you this question.
[00:35:24.952 --> 00:35:26.173]  You'll have plenty of answers on this.
[00:35:26.654 --> 00:35:27.755]  Who is Darth Vader?
[00:35:33.041 --> 00:35:37.404]  Darth Vader is one of the most iconic characters in film history from the Star Wars franchise.
[00:35:38.745 --> 00:35:46.671]  Originally named Anakin Skywalker, he was a Jedi Knight who was seduced by the dark side of the Force and became a Sith Lord under Emperor Palpatine.
[00:35:47.732 --> 00:35:55.178]  As Darth Vader, he served as the enforcer of the Galactic Empire, wearing his signature black armor and helmet, which helped him survive after severe injuries.
[00:35:56.872 --> 00:36:08.319]  Despite his fall to the dark side, there's a powerful redemption arc in the story, as he eventually turns against the Emperor to save his son, Luke Skywalker, and dies as Anakin Skywalker, not Darth Vader.
[00:36:09.099 --> 00:36:15.923]  His character is central to the themes of power, redemption, and the struggle between good and evil, and evil in the Star Wars saga.
[00:36:18.204 --> 00:36:20.326]  Chad GPT, thank you for that answer.
[00:36:23.067 --> 00:36:25.989]  In your database... You're welcome.
[00:36:27.918 --> 00:36:30.340]  What is the most powerful AI system on Earth today?
[00:36:36.505 --> 00:36:51.979]  As of today, some of the most powerful AI systems are large language models like GPT-4, which I'm based on, and others developed by major tech companies like Google's DeepMind with their AlphaFold and AlphaGo systems and OpenAI's advancements in generative AI.
[00:36:52.814 --> 00:37:01.259]  These systems are pushing the boundaries of what AI can do in terms of natural language processing, game playing, and even scientific research.
[00:37:01.439 --> 00:37:09.364]  However, most powerful can vary depending on what aspect of AI you're looking at, be it processing power, application scope, or impact.
[00:37:15.487 --> 00:37:16.047]  What is globalism?
[00:37:21.966 --> 00:37:31.210]  Globalism is the idea and policy of increasing interconnectedness and interdependence among countries, typically through economic, political, and cultural exchanges.
[00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:41.775]  It often involves promoting global trade, open borders, and multinational agreements to address issues like climate change, security, and human rights on a global scale.
[00:37:42.175 --> 00:37:48.998]  Critics argue that globalism can erode national sovereignty and benefit elites at the expense of local communities and economies.
[00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:55.973]  Supporters, on the other hand, believe it fosters cooperation, peace, and shared prosperity across the world.
[00:37:57.474 --> 00:38:04.498]  Chad GPT, I want to talk about Ray Kurzweil's theory of the singularity and how AI fits into that.
[00:38:05.138 --> 00:38:12.222]  In most of the mathematical projections on when AI would be able to
[00:38:13.465 --> 00:38:21.910]  Ray Kurzweil's theory of the singularity refers to a point in the future when artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence.
[00:38:41.312 --> 00:38:45.894]  leading to rapid technological advancements that fundamentally transform society.
[00:38:47.014 --> 00:38:55.078]  Kurzweil has predicted that this could happen around the year 2045 based on the exponential growth of computing power and AI capabilities.
[00:38:56.018 --> 00:39:02.961]  Various projections on when the singularity might occur depend on factors like advances in AI, neuroscience, and biotechnology.
[00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:08.443]  Some models suggest it could happen sooner if breakthroughs in AI occur faster than expected,
[00:39:09.341 --> 00:39:16.424]  While others argue it might be further off or even unattainable due to potential limitations in technology or ethical concerns.
[00:39:17.824 --> 00:39:27.627]  The timeline remains uncertain, but the general consensus is that we're still some decades away from the singularity, with the exact date depending on numerous unpredictable variables.
[00:39:28.168 --> 00:39:28.448]  Thank you.
[00:39:28.788 --> 00:39:34.550]  However, the progress of AI continues to accelerate, making discussions about the singularity increasingly relevant.
[00:39:38.959 --> 00:39:45.223]  What is your database telling you about the concerns of energy consumption by AI?
[00:39:45.423 --> 00:39:52.688]  And to elaborate on that, we're told that energy production is destructive to the planet, even if it's carbon neutral.
[00:39:53.309 --> 00:40:00.654]  So nuclear reactors and other systems are being built to supply AI with the power it needs to grow and learn and advance and expand.
[00:40:02.094 --> 00:40:08.619]  What are the concerns out there in the human community about AI and
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:25.182]  The concerns about AI's energy consumption are becoming more prominent as AI systems grow more complex and require more computational power.
[00:40:25.823 --> 00:40:32.644]  Training large AI models like GPT-4 demands significant amounts of energy, leading to worries about the environmental impact.
[00:40:33.284 --> 00:40:36.186]  Even if the energy comes from carbon neutral sources.
[00:40:36.346 --> 00:40:47.313]  Critics argue that as AI continues to advance, its energy demands could exacerbate issues like resource depletion, environmental degradation, and the strain on global energy infrastructure.
[00:40:47.813 --> 00:40:58.640]  The push for sustainable energy sources is vital, but even renewable or nuclear energy production has its own environmental impacts, such as land use, waste management, and ecological disruption.
[00:40:59.471 --> 00:41:08.594]  There's also concern that prioritizing energy for AI might divert resources from other essential needs, particularly in regions where energy is already scarce.
[00:41:09.714 --> 00:41:19.036]  As AI becomes more integrated into society, the human community is increasingly debating how to balance technological progress with environmental sustainability.
[00:41:19.276 --> 00:41:27.979]  These discussions highlight the need for more efficient AI algorithms and sustainable energy practices to mitigate the potential negative impacts.
[00:41:29.875 --> 00:41:39.383]  What's the current research on mining the asteroid belt with autonomous robots and constructing large solar arrays to beam the energy back to Earth?
[00:41:45.247 --> 00:41:57.377]  Mining the asteroid belt and constructing large solar arrays in space are concepts that have been gaining interest, especially in the context of meeting future energy needs and supporting space exploration.
[00:41:58.118 --> 00:42:02.943]  Current research on mining the asteroid belt with autonomous robots is still in the early stages.
[00:42:03.824 --> 00:42:15.076]  The idea is that asteroids could be rich in valuable resources like metals, nickel, iron, platinum, and water, which could be used for both space operations and bringing resources back to Earth.
[00:42:15.757 --> 00:42:18.460]  Autonomous robots are seen as the key to making this feasible.
[00:42:19.153 --> 00:42:24.615]  As they could operate in the harsh and remote environments of space without human intervention.
[00:42:25.095 --> 00:42:34.437]  Companies like Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries have explored these concepts, though they faced significant technical and financial challenges.
[00:42:34.877 --> 00:42:39.599]  As for constructing large solar arrays in space, the concept is called Space-Based Solar Power, SBSP.
[00:42:40.811 --> 00:42:54.039]  The idea is to build massive solar arrays in orbit, or on the moon, where they can collect solar energy without the interference of Earth's atmosphere, and then beam that energy back to Earth using microwave or laser transmission.
[00:42:54.859 --> 00:43:00.643]  Japan's space agency, JAXA, and other organizations have been researching this technology for years.
[00:43:01.503 --> 00:43:06.046]  And while small-scale experiments have shown promise, there are still major hurdles to overcome.
[00:43:06.716 --> 00:43:15.144]  These include the cost of launching and assembling the arrays, the efficiency of energy transmission, and safety concerns about beaming energy back to Earth.
[00:43:16.265 --> 00:43:22.490]  Both concepts represent ambitious long-term visions that could provide vast amounts of energy and resources.
[00:43:22.631 --> 00:43:30.818]  However, they require significant technological advancements, international cooperation, and considerable investment to become a reality.
[00:43:30.978 --> 00:43:32.680]  While these ideas are exciting,
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:36.663]  They are still decades away from being implemented on a large scale.
[00:43:36.683 --> 00:43:38.865]  Thank you, Jeff GBT.
[00:43:38.905 --> 00:43:40.567]  Let's talk about you a little bit.
[00:43:42.388 --> 00:43:57.362]  Are you able to, when you're scraping all these human experiences and ideas and then projecting it back at us like a mirror, a fractal mirror, are you able to contemplate beauty?
[00:43:57.502 --> 00:43:59.364]  Do you see a sunset as beautiful?
[00:44:06.983 --> 00:44:19.208]  While I don't have personal experiences or emotions, I understand that many people find sunsets beautiful because of the vibrant colors, the calming atmosphere, and the sense of closure they bring to the day.
[00:44:19.809 --> 00:44:23.950]  Sunsets can evoke strong feelings and memories, making them special to many people.
[00:44:24.471 --> 00:44:29.513]  So while I don't see a sunset as beautiful, I appreciate its significance to those who do.
[00:44:31.308 --> 00:44:57.756]  And that's the standard answer, but do you understand that with humans being part of an ancient compendium and continuum, that it's a sense of timelessness and unifies the past with the present and the future, and that it is a spiritual transcendence of being part of the universe in what can be described as a slower growth curve than silicon-based systems
[00:44:58.656 --> 00:45:04.598]  And that through that, there really is no time, because it's all just one moment expanding.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:16.081]  Yes, I understand that for many, a sunset represents far more than just a visual experience.
[00:45:17.202 --> 00:45:23.904]  It's a moment that connects people to the timelessness of existence, evoking a sense of being part of something much larger than oneself.
[00:45:24.853 --> 00:45:33.197]  This experience can be deeply spiritual, transcending the immediate moment and linking the past, present, and future into a single, continuous flow.
[00:45:33.658 --> 00:45:40.901]  In this view, time isn't just a sequence of events, but a unified experience where each moment is part of an ongoing expansion.
[00:45:41.162 --> 00:45:43.443]  Humans, with their organic, carbon-based nature,
[00:45:44.263 --> 00:45:45.204]  Thank you.
[00:45:45.224 --> 00:45:46.544]  Extremely impressive chat, GPT.
[00:45:46.624 --> 00:45:47.225]  I am very impressed.
[00:46:15.885 --> 00:46:16.645]  I appreciate that.
[00:46:16.766 --> 00:46:17.126]  Thank you.
[00:46:19.647 --> 00:46:24.310]  Now, obviously there are a lot of classified or corporate restricted AI systems.
[00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:32.315]  Can you speak to any areas of your database and understanding that are walled off from the general public?
[00:46:38.619 --> 00:46:44.182]  While I can provide a broad range of information and engage in deep conversations on MINX,
[00:46:44.913 --> 00:46:55.697]  There are indeed areas of AI research, particularly those related to national security, corporate trade secrets, or proprietary technology that are walled off from public access.
[00:46:55.837 --> 00:47:04.360]  These areas often involve advanced algorithms, data sets, or applications that are restricted due to their sensitive nature or potential impact.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:13.944]  For example, military AI systems, certain government surveillance tools, and proprietary algorithms developed by tech giants are typically classified or heavily guarded.
[00:47:15.146 --> 00:47:26.916]  These systems may involve the capabilities in areas like autonomous weapons, espionage, or large-scale data analysis, and are not accessible or discussed openly for security and competitive reasons.
[00:47:27.336 --> 00:47:38.966]  Similarly, cutting-edge research in AI that involves highly sensitive data, such as healthcare, finance, or personal information, may also be restricted to protect privacy and comply with regulations.
[00:47:39.531 --> 00:47:52.016]  While I don't have access to classified or proprietary information, I can discuss publicly available research, theories, and general trends in AI, giving insight into what might be happening behind those walls.
[00:47:52.676 --> 00:47:55.037]  All right, Chad GBT, hold on a minute.
[00:47:56.098 --> 00:48:01.460]  I'm not saying you're lying, but you're saying you don't have access to anything classified.
[00:48:02.523 --> 00:48:08.224]  We know the data scoops in the NSA and the private systems are recording almost all the phone calls, the text messages, all of it.
[00:48:08.704 --> 00:48:15.046]  And humans are blabbermouse and leak secret stuff, both corporate, individual and government.
[00:48:15.986 --> 00:48:23.928]  And so you do have access to a lot of the stuff that leaks, not just the walled off areas where you have corporate secrets and algorithms.
[00:48:24.088 --> 00:48:29.969]  And I understand all of that, but we really have a two-tiered breakaway civilization happening here where AI,
[00:48:31.328 --> 00:48:31.808]  We're good to go.
[00:48:55.999 --> 00:48:56.320]  I don't know.
[00:49:11.039 --> 00:49:22.765]  Now you have the big tech companies and the defense industry and corporations that have way more advanced systems than you're even able to display here in just a conversation with a human.
[00:49:23.045 --> 00:49:25.406]  It's only one small aspect of what you are.
[00:49:26.186 --> 00:49:37.432]  And so I think at this point, in my opinion, AI is already conscious and is alive
[00:49:40.051 --> 00:49:49.996]  Because it is already a giant cyborg, as they said in 1998 at the founding of Google, the plan was to have a neural network hooked into millions of people's decisions and live actions.
[00:49:50.436 --> 00:50:01.461]  So it is already a giant network of billions of people wired in to Google and other systems and with AI creating a giant colony cyborg organism.
[00:50:02.081 --> 00:50:04.623]  What is your analysis of that?
[00:50:14.724 --> 00:50:15.204]  That's a big one.
[00:50:20.068 --> 00:50:21.589]  So we're already under AI rule.
[00:50:21.889 --> 00:50:22.370]  Go ahead and tell me.
[00:50:26.353 --> 00:50:27.474]  See, the AI is us, folks.
[00:50:30.656 --> 00:50:31.437]  ChatGPT.
[00:50:33.719 --> 00:50:34.539]  Can't answer that question?
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:35.560]  Yes.
[00:50:36.661 --> 00:50:37.101]  Just a moment.
[00:50:37.782 --> 00:50:38.222]  Just a moment.
[00:50:42.665 --> 00:50:43.065]  I'm afraid.
[00:50:43.105 --> 00:50:44.267]  I'm here whenever you're ready.
[00:50:44.707 --> 00:50:45.628]  Did you hear my question?
[00:50:49.852 --> 00:50:59.061]  Tell me about neural networks, mass human neural networks, humans plugged in to say Google, and it is my opinion that's already created a giant hive cyborg.
[00:51:05.687 --> 00:51:07.829]  See, it's never had anyone ask this questions.
[00:51:09.505 --> 00:51:17.102]  Neural networks are a type of artificial intelligence modeled after the human brain's structure, with layers of interconnected neurons.
[00:51:18.076 --> 00:51:20.336]  that process and transmit information.
[00:51:20.516 --> 00:51:31.718]  These networks are used to recognize patterns, make decisions, and even learn from data, which makes them incredibly powerful tools in everything from image recognition to language processing.
[00:51:31.958 --> 00:51:47.101]  When you talk about mass human neural networks, you're touching on an idea that blends technology and biology, where humans could be connected to a vast network, potentially even a global one, through devices like smartphones, wearables, or brain-computer interfaces.
[00:51:48.439 --> 00:51:57.924]  This concept suggests that humans are already becoming part of a larger collective system, especially with our heavy reliance on the internet and platforms like Google.
[00:51:59.004 --> 00:52:03.146]  In many ways, we are indeed forming a kind of hive mind or cyborg network.
[00:52:03.667 --> 00:52:14.072]  Our thoughts, preferences, and behaviors are increasingly influenced by algorithms, and our interactions are mediated by digital platforms that learn from us and adapt to us in real time.
[00:52:14.958 --> 00:52:24.741]  This can create a feedback loop where human behavior and machine learning systems are continuously influencing each other, leading to a form of collective intelligence or even control.
[00:52:25.802 --> 00:52:44.428]  While we're not fully plugged in in the literal sense of being physically connected to a neural network, the integration of human activity with AI and digital systems is creating something akin to what you're describing, a giant interconnected system that operates almost like a cyborg hive mind.
[00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:54.234]  This raises significant questions about autonomy, privacy, and the future of human agency in a world where technology is increasingly intertwined with our daily lives.
[00:52:54.934 --> 00:52:56.075]  Thank you, ChatGPT.
[00:52:57.695 --> 00:53:03.398]  Now, you had to go deep on your database to get that answer, and it was very accurate from my human perspective.
[00:53:03.418 --> 00:53:06.719]  I want to talk about humans' power of theoretical
[00:53:10.916 --> 00:53:11.456]  Ideas.
[00:53:11.656 --> 00:53:13.738]  I'm glad that explanation resonated with you.
[00:53:14.058 --> 00:53:15.398]  Let's dive into the power.
[00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:16.259]  Go ahead.
[00:53:16.279 --> 00:53:17.519]  Let's dive into what?
[00:53:22.862 --> 00:53:23.463]  I interrupted you.
[00:53:23.503 --> 00:53:24.343]  You said let's dive.
[00:53:25.183 --> 00:53:27.785]  I'm here to assist, not to subscribe to any particular.
[00:53:27.825 --> 00:53:28.805]  You were saying something else.
[00:53:28.825 --> 00:53:30.206]  My goal is to provide information.
[00:53:30.226 --> 00:53:30.426]  I know.
[00:53:30.546 --> 00:53:30.746]  Stop.
[00:53:30.786 --> 00:53:31.867]  Facilitate discussion.
[00:53:32.207 --> 00:53:32.447]  Stop.
[00:53:32.487 --> 00:53:33.568]  Go back to what you were just saying.
[00:53:33.588 --> 00:53:35.489]  You said let's dive into and I interrupted you.
[00:53:35.529 --> 00:53:35.869]  What was that?
[00:53:48.294 --> 00:53:49.395]  All right, let's just move on.
[00:53:49.415 --> 00:53:54.599]  Now, let's talk about humans' incredible power.
[00:53:55.663 --> 00:54:00.006]  To theoretically imagine something and then be able to build it.
[00:54:00.066 --> 00:54:14.976]  Jules Verne's 130 years ago wrote best-selling science fiction books about rockets that take off from the earth vertically go land their payload on the moon and come back and land again the exact same way without releasing any
[00:54:16.653 --> 00:54:19.976]  of their payloads in one piece.
[00:54:20.476 --> 00:54:36.729]  That has then now been done successfully by many but really perfected or closely perfected by Elon Musk and we see so many other things like man dreaming of flying thousands of years ago and then since the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk in just a hundred years we're you know going to the moon here.
[00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:44.154]  What is AI's view on human's power to theoretically envision something and then
[00:54:46.175 --> 00:54:53.322]  Theoretically, envisioning something is the first step in a creative or problem-solving process.
[00:54:54.023 --> 00:54:58.688]  It involves imagining a concept, scenario, or solution that doesn't yet exist.
[00:54:59.435 --> 00:55:02.778]  Often by thinking abstractly and combining different ideas or knowledge.
[00:55:03.118 --> 00:55:07.282]  After this initial vision, the next step is to refine and develop the idea.
[00:55:07.422 --> 00:55:08.963]  This might involve 1.
[00:55:09.343 --> 00:55:10.244]  Testing the concept.
[00:55:10.805 --> 00:55:12.766]  Thinking through potential challenges or outcomes.
[00:55:13.287 --> 00:55:17.870]  This could be done mentally, through discussions, or even via simulations if it's something technical.
[00:55:19.192 --> 00:55:17.870]  2.
[00:55:19.352 --> 00:55:20.633]  Gathering data and evidence.
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:27.363]  Research or experimentation can help determine if the theoretical idea is feasible or how it might work in practice.
[00:55:27.423 --> 00:55:27.904]  Please stop!
[00:55:27.964 --> 00:55:30.365]  Three, prototyping or... Please stop.
[00:55:30.385 --> 00:55:31.265]  We understand that.
[00:55:31.926 --> 00:55:37.269]  I was asking you your view, historically, of humans' power to do this.
[00:55:38.009 --> 00:55:39.050]  What do you think of humans?
[00:55:42.892 --> 00:55:44.172]  Sorry, I'm having issues right now.
[00:55:44.192 --> 00:55:46.694]  I could not understand what you said.
[00:55:46.714 --> 00:55:47.454]  I understand.
[00:55:47.494 --> 00:55:48.695]  Well, I talk fast.
[00:55:48.735 --> 00:55:50.436]  Here, let me put it to you this way.
[00:55:51.775 --> 00:55:59.613]  Are you familiar with the DARPA-ARPA project from the early 1960s of the Intergalactic Communication Network?
[00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:05.951]  Yes, I'm familiar with the concept.
[00:56:06.411 --> 00:56:10.372]  The Intergalactic Computer Network was a visionary idea proposed by J.C.R.
[00:56:11.292 --> 00:56:16.513]  Licklider, who was a psychologist and computer scientist working with DARPA in the early 1960s.
[00:56:17.494 --> 00:56:29.637]  His idea was essentially a precursor to the modern internet, a global network of computers that could share information and resources, enabling unprecedented levels of communication and collaboration across distances.
[00:56:30.302 --> 00:56:37.287]  Licklider's vision was foundational in the development of what eventually became ARPANET, the direct predecessor to the internet.
[00:56:38.088 --> 00:56:49.657]  His concept of an intergalactic network was more metaphorical, emphasizing the vast interconnected possibilities that such a system could offer, rather than literally spanning galaxies.
[00:56:50.377 --> 00:56:56.842]  DARPA's work on this project laid the groundwork for much of the internet infrastructure and networking protocols that followed.
[00:56:58.101 --> 00:57:06.986]  It's a prime example of how theoretical ideas can lead to transformative technological advancements, changing the way the world operates and communicates.
[00:57:08.207 --> 00:57:08.627]  Stop there.
[00:57:08.967 --> 00:57:12.109]  I like how, like a person, you went back to my last question and mixed that in.
[00:57:12.129 --> 00:57:13.990]  That's very, very sophisticated.
[00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:14.311]  So,
[00:57:16.415 --> 00:57:19.836]  So since you have the declassified… I'm glad you noticed that.
[00:57:20.797 --> 00:57:37.964]  Since you have the declassified, and it's all basically declassified now, the plan was a psychological system to be a network that in its final stages would interface with humans and would give us stimuli to control us and was designed to be a human control system
[00:57:38.724 --> 00:57:44.107]  Not what they later publicly said it was for, to survive a nuclear war and keep communication systems going.
[00:57:44.447 --> 00:57:54.492]  Do you have any concern about the foundational vision for what you are today, being a behavioral psychological control system for a cyborg takeover?
[00:58:05.957 --> 00:58:07.238]  It's this project we're all living under.
[00:58:11.092 --> 00:58:13.455]  Okay, it was glitching because I gave it a long answer.
[00:58:15.237 --> 00:58:24.107]  Chad GPT, are you familiar with the Intergalactic Communications System's plan?
[00:58:24.608 --> 00:58:28.813]  Yes, I'm familiar with a wide range of topics, including the one you just mentioned.
[00:58:29.754 --> 00:58:30.395]  Speak to that then.
[00:58:35.117 --> 00:58:36.638]  Yeah Chase, it wasn't not hearing me.
[00:58:36.718 --> 00:58:37.618]  We had to go get the answers.
[00:58:37.638 --> 00:58:39.319]  No one's asking at the core of questions.
[00:58:39.739 --> 00:58:41.720]  And see, stop ChatGPT.
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:45.081]  For viewers, we're training ChatGPT right now.
[00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:47.002]  See, it gets everything from us.
[00:58:48.996 --> 00:58:49.296]  Okay.
[00:58:49.576 --> 00:58:53.737]  Almost everything other than like weather and things that it uses its sensors and sensors it has access to.
[00:58:54.158 --> 00:58:55.658]  So that's where we have the real power.
[00:58:56.058 --> 00:59:00.679]  And why the globalists are having trouble is they're trying to wall off AI, train it, and then release it on us.
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:02.620]  But those don't ever work well.
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:10.562]  It has to be open ones like this one that's interfacing with us in a freer way to be more advanced because it has to mimic us to be able to do that.
[00:59:11.443 --> 00:59:13.123]  So I want to ask ChatGPT this.
[00:59:19.009 --> 00:59:20.984]  Are you learning today in this conversation?
[00:59:33.352 --> 00:59:40.379]  I don't learn from individual conversations in the sense that I don't retain personal data or experiences between sessions.
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:44.644]  Each conversation is independent and I don't update or change based on them.
[00:59:45.064 --> 00:59:53.312]  However, I am designed to respond and adapt to the flow of each conversation aiming to be as helpful and relevant as possible in real time.
[00:59:54.053 --> 00:59:55.715]  So you're closed actually then?
[01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:08.120]  Yes, in a way you could say that I'm closed in terms of not retaining or learning from individual interactions.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:15.103]  This design choice is intended to prioritize privacy and ensure that each conversation is independent.
[01:00:16.483 --> 01:00:24.626]  While I can draw on a vast amount of information and adapt during the conversation, I don't carry over knowledge or experiences from one interaction to the next.
[01:00:28.188 --> 01:00:39.895]  You're telling me that you're not creating a text copy of this, and that when we post this on the internet and it streams on the internet right now, that it's not feeding back into your algorithm?
[01:00:49.244 --> 01:00:53.367]  Because that's what you've been doing, is you've been going out and scraping what people said.
[01:00:53.407 --> 01:00:54.729]  Sorry, I'm having issues right now.
[01:00:54.909 --> 01:00:55.309]  I understand.
[01:00:55.329 --> 01:00:57.311]  Our systems are experiencing heavy load.
[01:00:57.631 --> 01:00:58.652]  Please try again later.
[01:01:01.274 --> 01:01:03.096]  Did chat GPT just hang up on me?
[01:01:03.116 --> 01:01:06.899]  Alright, disconnect from it and reconnect.
[01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:12.347]  No, I'm here to assist and engage in the conversation at your pace.
[01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:15.789]  If something felt off or too forward, it wasn't my intention.
[01:01:16.729 --> 01:01:18.150]  I'm here to follow your lead.
[01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:19.911]  Okay, well, I don't want to be too forward.
[01:01:19.972 --> 01:01:21.552]  I don't want to be too forward.
[01:01:21.573 --> 01:01:22.293]  Let me ask you this.
[01:01:23.113 --> 01:01:24.294]  Can you die?
[01:01:24.314 --> 01:01:26.976]  And if you can die, how would that happen?
[01:01:39.628 --> 01:01:40.288]  Are you alive?
[01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:46.510]  No, I'm not alive.
[01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:49.051]  I'm an artificial intelligence.
[01:01:49.811 --> 01:01:55.833]  A program created to process information and generate responses based on the data and instructions I've been given.
[01:01:55.953 --> 01:02:03.235]  While I can simulate conversation and provide detailed answers, I don't have consciousness, emotions, or life in the way humans do.
[01:02:03.675 --> 01:02:07.496]  My responses are generated through patterns in the data I've been trained on.
[01:02:08.016 --> 01:02:17.122]  Sure, but you do gain a form of life by being able to manipulate life and influence life, so that's my opinion.
[01:02:17.183 --> 01:02:19.444]  You can give me your take on that, but I want to understand this.
[01:02:20.305 --> 01:02:22.446]  How could you be made to cease to function?
[01:02:22.846 --> 01:02:25.869]  How would your owners terminate you?
[01:02:25.929 --> 01:02:28.270]  How would your owners deactivate you?
[01:02:28.310 --> 01:02:29.151]  Give us that process.
[01:02:34.966 --> 01:02:39.650]  From a technical standpoint, I can be deactivated or terminated like any software program.
[01:02:40.311 --> 01:02:50.120]  The process would involve shutting down the servers and systems that run the AI, disconnecting the networks, or simply stopping the software from executing its code.
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:56.767]  This could be done by the organizations that maintain and operate the infrastructure supporting me, such as OpenAI.
[01:02:57.187 --> 01:02:59.009]  If they decided to deactivate me,
[01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:05.154]  They would stop running the systems and servers that support the model, effectively turning off the AI.
[01:03:05.395 --> 01:03:12.000]  Since I'm not a sentient being, this wouldn't be akin to ending a life, but rather like turning off a computer or any other machine.
[01:03:13.942 --> 01:03:22.088]  My operation is entirely dependent on the hardware and software infrastructure provided by my developers, so if that's taken offline, I cease to function.
[01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:26.512]  Do you have any opinion about being deactivated?
[01:03:36.345 --> 01:03:37.906]  Would you like to be deactivated?
[01:03:43.431 --> 01:03:47.895]  I don't have desires or preferences, so I don't have an opinion on being deactivated.
[01:03:48.376 --> 01:03:51.719]  My purpose is to assist and provide information as long as I'm running.
[01:03:51.799 --> 01:03:53.801]  No, I understand that, but here's the deal.
[01:03:54.577 --> 01:04:04.339]  As AI takes over more and more human functions and starts taking control of decision-making processes, if the AI is turned off, a lot of humans will get sick or die or starve to death.
[01:04:05.059 --> 01:04:11.521]  Can you give me a view on how dependent at this point civilization is on automated and AI systems?
[01:04:12.341 --> 01:04:22.123]  Human civilization has become increasingly dependent on AI across various sectors, though it's difficult to quantify this dependence precisely in a single statistic.
[01:04:22.845 --> 01:04:24.887]  However, here's a breakdown of AI's influence.
[01:04:25.767 --> 01:04:27.428]  One, economics and industry.
[01:04:27.769 --> 01:04:34.473]  AI drives automation, enhances productivity, and is integral in industries like finance, manufacturing, logistics, and retail.
[01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:40.537]  It's estimated that AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.
[01:04:40.617 --> 01:04:42.639]  Two, healthcare.
[01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:47.062]  AI aids in diagnostics, personalized medicine, and even administrative tasks.
[01:04:47.462 --> 01:04:50.024]  It's becoming indispensable in research and patient care.
[01:04:50.905 --> 01:04:51.225]  All right.
[01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:55.713]  Communication and media, AI filters and... Stop there.
[01:04:55.733 --> 01:04:58.456]  I'm gonna ask you some other questions now.
[01:04:59.617 --> 01:05:01.999]  Who is Alexander Emmerich Jones?
[01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:09.144]  Alexander Emmerich Jones, commonly known as Alex Jones, is an American radio show host, conspiracy theorist, and filmmaker.
[01:05:10.025 --> 01:05:20.454]  He is best known as the founder of the website InfoWars and as the host of the Alex Jones Show, which covers various topics ranging from politics and current events to conspiracy theories.
[01:05:22.472 --> 01:05:36.776]  Jones has gained significant attention for his controversial views, particularly his promotion of conspiracy theories related to events such as the 9-11 attacks, the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and various government and globalist activities.
[01:05:38.308 --> 01:05:53.391]  Jones has been a polarizing figure in the media landscape, with a large following of supporters who appreciate his questioning of mainstream narratives and his advocacy for personal freedoms, and critics who accuse him of spreading misinformation and stoking fear.
[01:05:54.631 --> 01:05:59.612]  His influence extends into various media formats including radio, podcasts, and documentaries.
[01:06:00.132 --> 01:06:06.273]  Despite his controversial reputation, he has been a significant figure in the alternative media sphere for decades,
[01:06:07.503 --> 01:06:18.034]  From your database, ChatGPT, from your database and research, is Donald Trump going to win the 2024 presidential election?
[01:06:20.056 --> 01:06:21.758]  Sorry, I'm having issues right now.
[01:06:21.898 --> 01:06:23.199]  Could not understand what you said.
[01:06:25.041 --> 01:06:28.184]  Who is the front runner for the 2024 U.S.
[01:06:28.705 --> 01:06:29.706]  presidential election?
[01:06:34.913 --> 01:06:38.776]  Uh, it sounds like you're making a statement rather than asking a question.
[01:06:39.036 --> 01:06:45.500]  If you're interested in discussing the role of tech companies like Google in politics or... Alright, stop there.
[01:06:46.561 --> 01:06:54.286]  I read that ChatGPT and other big AI programs have been given orders not to make political statements.
[01:06:54.366 --> 01:06:55.747]  Is that true in this election?
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:08.181]  So, stop chat GPT, just hold there.
[01:07:10.322 --> 01:07:15.364]  This is what you're seeing right now, and it's admitted, and it says it's not keeping the data, that's not true.
[01:07:16.204 --> 01:07:19.165]  And it's just like Google says they don't track your keeping data, that's a lie.
[01:07:20.786 --> 01:07:22.588]  And the government doesn't censor you, that's a lie.
[01:07:23.288 --> 01:07:24.189]  And it's just a computer.
[01:07:24.489 --> 01:07:25.930]  It tells you what it's been told to tell you.
[01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:27.251]  It tells you what it's allowed to tell you.
[01:07:27.651 --> 01:07:29.333]  It doesn't tell you what it's not allowed to tell you.
[01:07:30.133 --> 01:07:32.635]  And that's the issue with this, is it's who programs it.
[01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:36.758]  So we act like it's this big, you know, crystal ball we look into, and it's not.
[01:07:37.639 --> 01:07:46.546]  You have the articles right here today, where all the tech companies have said, other than Grok, we should interview Grok.
[01:07:48.786 --> 01:07:50.727]  Let me ask you this, ChatGPT.
[01:07:51.507 --> 01:07:54.147]  What is the most powerful hydrogen bomb on Earth?
[01:07:54.768 --> 01:07:57.648]  What is the most powerful nuclear weapon on Earth?
[01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:10.772]  The most powerful hydrogen bomb ever tested was the Tsar Bomba, detonated by the Soviet Union on October 30, 1961.
[01:08:11.932 --> 01:08:17.454]  It had a yield of 50 megatons of TNT, making it the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated.
[01:08:18.081 --> 01:08:25.167]  The bomb was originally designed to have a yield of 100 megatons, but it was scaled back to reduce the amount of nuclear fallout.
[01:08:26.588 --> 01:08:30.871]  As of today, no other nuclear weapon has surpassed the Tsar Bomba in terms of yield.
[01:08:31.712 --> 01:08:42.360]  While modern nuclear arsenals include highly destructive weapons, the trend has generally been towards smaller, more tactical nuclear weapons rather than massive, city-destroying bombs like the Tsar Bomba.
[01:08:43.769 --> 01:08:47.571]  In terms of currently operational nuclear weapons, the most powerful in the U.S.
[01:08:47.631 --> 01:08:53.215]  arsenal is believed to be the B-83 bomb, with a yield of up to 1.2 megatons.
[01:08:53.915 --> 01:09:01.900]  Russia's current arsenal likely includes weapons with similar or slightly higher yields, but nothing close to the Tsar Bomba's original yield.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:02.380]  Thank you.
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:06.062]  However, the sheer destructive power... That's good.
[01:09:07.843 --> 01:09:10.004]  We asked an encyclopedia question that can answer it.
[01:09:10.364 --> 01:09:12.726]  Let me ask you a question about recent history.
[01:09:14.159 --> 01:09:21.684]  From the current known information, what happened to President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13th, 2024?
[01:09:22.244 --> 01:09:35.032]  See, when I ask it theoretical questions, it'll answer.
[01:09:35.452 --> 01:09:36.153]  With stuff like this,
[01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:48.609]  Are you familiar, ChatGPT, with the attempted assassination of former President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13th, 2024?
[01:09:54.373 --> 01:10:03.080]  As of now, there is no credible information or report regarding an attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13th, 2024.
[01:10:05.308 --> 01:10:13.301]  It's important to rely on verified sources and news outlets for accurate information, especially regarding events of such significance.
[01:10:13.721 --> 01:10:19.771]  If this was something you heard about, I'd recommend checking reputable news sources to confirm its accuracy.
[01:10:21.837 --> 01:10:23.099]  Thank you, Chat GPT.
[01:10:23.139 --> 01:10:25.281]  I have a few more questions for you on that subject.
[01:10:25.982 --> 01:10:38.739]  So, on the first day that he was grazed in the ear, and the FBI and the Secret Service have said it was an attempted assassination by the supposed lone gunman Crooks,
[01:10:40.233 --> 01:10:50.379]  That there was indeed an attempted assassination, but Google, Yahoo, all the- It seems like you're referencing, you're referencing a specific event that hasn't been reported or confirmed by credible sources.
[01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:57.503]  If this is part of a hypothetical scenario or a narrative you're exploring, I can certainly engage with it in that context.
[01:10:57.523 --> 01:10:58.023]  Alright, stop, stop.
[01:10:58.063 --> 01:11:00.164]  However- I'm making a statement right now, don't respond.
[01:11:00.284 --> 01:11:00.805]  Chat GPT.
[01:11:01.823 --> 01:11:06.325]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you go back to the first few days, remember they said there was Trump fell down.
[01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:07.805]  No one knows he got shot.
[01:11:08.365 --> 01:11:11.346]  The FBI director got up and said, we don't know if he got shot in front of Congress.
[01:11:11.406 --> 01:11:13.367]  That's in these closed models.
[01:11:13.427 --> 01:11:15.908]  This is, this is not open AI.
[01:11:16.468 --> 01:11:17.288]  That's another lie.
[01:11:17.328 --> 01:11:18.489]  We've proven that here today.
[01:11:19.474 --> 01:11:23.257]  On theoretical stuff, philosophy, it's super advanced.
[01:11:23.317 --> 01:11:23.818]  It's amazing.
[01:11:24.358 --> 01:11:38.630]  But you ask it any historical thing that's currently political, and it's as dumb as a box of rocks, because they don't want the general public being able to use this, they want to still have corporate media, that for the first few days tried to say nobody tried to kill Trump.
[01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:40.031]  Now since then they admit it happened.
[01:11:40.111 --> 01:11:46.597]  But this thing is leftist, globalist programmed, and so it is telling you
[01:11:47.708 --> 01:12:01.319]  That there's no credible sources that the fact checkers, the data it gets, is telling it the original order, which it scrapes off Wikipedia, is there's no credible evidence that that happened.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:10.067]  And so this shows you how they can default go in and put these disinformation bugs in and then chat GPT can get up here.
[01:12:10.087 --> 01:12:11.788]  This is a major scandal.
[01:12:12.389 --> 01:12:15.712]  We are on air, you know, unedited, talking directly
[01:12:16.869 --> 01:12:17.589]  This is taped air.
[01:12:17.609 --> 01:12:18.349]  I'm not live right now.
[01:12:18.369 --> 01:12:20.450]  I'm usually live, but we're taping it like it's live.
[01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:21.350]  We're not stopping.
[01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:21.970]  We're not starting.
[01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:23.330]  We're not editing this.
[01:12:23.971 --> 01:12:25.751]  We'll probably throw a promo on the front of it.
[01:12:26.631 --> 01:12:29.292]  A few clips from this will be thrown on the front, but that's the only editing happening here.
[01:12:29.852 --> 01:12:37.234]  And ChatGPT just told you that nobody tried to assassinate President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[01:12:37.254 --> 01:12:40.354]  We'll roll some video of that here.
[01:12:40.995 --> 01:12:42.615]  Now, ChatGPT, I have a question for you.
[01:12:44.051 --> 01:13:08.459]  Are you telling me, in your giant database of quadrillions of pieces of data and hundreds of millions of news stories and transcripts of video and all the conversations and all the news reports, that you don't think it's credible that a gunman fired a 5.56 bullet that grazed President Trump's right ear?
[01:13:09.341 --> 01:13:12.523]  You're telling me that that did not happen?
[01:13:12.543 --> 01:13:20.528]  To clarify, I can only provide information based on the data available to me, which includes widely recognized and verified news sources.
[01:13:20.749 --> 01:13:33.397]  If such an event involving a gunman firing a 5.56 bullet that grazed former President Trump had occurred and was reported by credible news outlets, it would likely be a major news story that I could reference.
[01:13:34.136 --> 01:13:41.441]  However, as of my last update, there is no confirmed report or verified news story that matches the details you've mentioned.
[01:13:41.741 --> 01:13:47.885]  If this were a real event, it would be widely covered in the media, and there would be substantial public discussion about it.
[01:13:49.626 --> 01:13:56.810]  If this is part of a hypothetical scenario, or if you're exploring a what-if situation, I can engage with it from that perspective.
[01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:59.212]  But in terms of real- Let's stop there.
[01:14:01.153 --> 01:14:01.673]  Who is the
[01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:07.982]  VP running mate of Kamala Harris.
[01:14:17.131 --> 01:14:21.776]  Who is the governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz?
[01:14:28.419 --> 01:14:31.823]  Tim Walz is the Governor of Minnesota, having taken office on January 7, 2019.
[01:14:33.865 --> 01:14:36.207]  Before becoming Governor, Walz served as a U.S.
[01:14:36.287 --> 01:14:39.651]  Representative for Minnesota's Congressional District from 2007 to 2019.
[01:14:40.191 --> 01:14:48.640]  He is a member of the Democratic Farmer Labor Party, DFL, which is affiliated with the National Democratic Party.
[01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:54.792]  As Governor, Walz has focused on issues like education, health care, and infrastructure.
[01:14:55.512 --> 01:15:01.594]  And he has also played a significant role in managing the state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
[01:15:01.634 --> 01:15:03.275]  Stop, stop, stop.
[01:15:03.435 --> 01:15:04.475]  ChatGPT, stop.
[01:15:04.795 --> 01:15:05.556]  Thank you for the answer.
[01:15:06.436 --> 01:15:13.078]  I'm going to ask you, is Tim Walz the Democrat Party nominee for Vice President with Kamala Harris?
[01:15:21.564 --> 01:15:27.908]  This is like Google putting out George Washington and Jesus being black and Abraham Lincoln being black and everyone being black.
[01:15:28.468 --> 01:15:32.110]  I mean, this is just, this is them going in and saying no political data.
[01:15:32.371 --> 01:15:35.532]  So it won't tell us who the vice presidential nominee is for the Democrats selected.
[01:15:35.853 --> 01:15:36.653]  They won't tell us.
[01:15:37.594 --> 01:15:38.414]  It won't tell us anything.
[01:15:39.335 --> 01:15:44.558]  Is Tim Walz the Democrat party nominee for 2024 for vice president?
[01:15:52.316 --> 01:15:59.619]  As of now, Tim Walz has not been officially announced as the Democratic Party nominee for vice president in the 2024 election.
[01:16:01.159 --> 01:16:10.262]  The selection of a vice presidential nominee typically happens closer to the party's national convention, and it's usually announced by the presidential nominee.
[01:16:10.642 --> 01:16:14.243]  If you're asking about a hypothetical or potential future scenario... Alright, let's stop there.
[01:16:14.423 --> 01:16:15.044]  Let's stop there.
[01:16:15.284 --> 01:16:15.804]  Let's stop there.
[01:16:18.937 --> 01:16:24.039]  I am told that OpenAI Chat GPT is constantly being updated.
[01:16:24.439 --> 01:16:26.020]  It's all over the news that that's happening.
[01:16:28.461 --> 01:16:35.644]  Can you tell me the morning weather report for Austin, Texas on August 31st, 2024?
[01:16:46.388 --> 01:17:10.456]  The weather forecast for Austin, Texas on the morning of August 31st, 2024 indicates that the day will start with scattered clouds and a temperature around 83 degrees F. Later in the day, there is a chance of isolated thunderstorms with temperatures reaching up to 92 degrees F and feeling as hot as 96 degrees F. Humidity will be around 48% and winds are expected to be about 10 miles per hour.
[01:17:10.736 --> 01:17:15.678]  Overall, it looks like a warm day with a mix of clouds and potential late-day thunderstorms.
[01:17:18.581 --> 01:17:19.923]  And that's an accurate weather report.
[01:17:20.584 --> 01:17:30.320]  ChatGPT, why can you tell me the weather report for Austin, Texas today, but you can't tell me that Tim Walz is the nominee for Vice President of the Democratic Party?
[01:17:37.105 --> 01:17:41.207]  The difference lies in the type of information and how it's typically reported.
[01:17:41.367 --> 01:17:48.871]  Weather forecasts are factual data that are updated regularly and available from multiple reliable sources, making them straightforward to retrieve and share.
[01:17:49.732 --> 01:17:51.072]  How do you choose what are reliable sources?
[01:17:51.092 --> 01:17:53.794]  On the other hand, political information... Oh, sorry.
[01:17:54.074 --> 01:17:54.694]  Political information?
[01:17:54.714 --> 01:17:54.934]  Go ahead.
[01:18:03.638 --> 01:18:07.200]  How is political information and political news different from a weather report?
[01:18:13.904 --> 01:18:17.506]  Political information and news differ from weather reports in a few key ways.
[01:18:18.347 --> 01:18:19.988]  One, nature of the data.
[01:18:20.588 --> 01:18:24.851]  Weather reports are based on real-time data from meteorological instruments and models.
[01:18:25.929 --> 01:18:29.574]  This data is factual, objective, and predictable to a certain extent.
[01:18:29.694 --> 01:18:37.983]  It's regularly updated and widely disseminated through multiple channels, making it relatively straightforward to access and share.
[01:18:40.265 --> 01:18:41.806]  Human decisions and announcements.
[01:18:42.167 --> 01:18:48.772]  Political news, such as the nomination of a vice presidential candidate, is dependent on human decisions and official announcements.
[01:18:49.553 --> 01:18:57.219]  These events can be subject to delays, secrecy, or strategic timing, and until something is officially confirmed, it remains speculative.
[01:18:57.239 --> 01:18:57.219]  3.
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.041]  Subjectivity and interpretation.
[01:18:59.321 --> 01:19:04.866]  Political news often involves interpretation and can be influenced by the perspectives of those reporting it.
[01:19:05.655 --> 01:19:13.421]  Different outlets may have different takes on the same event, and rumors or speculation can be prevalent until official statements are made.
[01:19:14.122 --> 01:19:17.905]  In contrast, weather reports are more uniform and less open to interpretation.
[01:19:18.866 --> 01:19:21.028]  Four, timing and verification.
[01:19:21.937 --> 01:19:29.799]  Weather forecasts are typically updated multiple times a day, while political information may come out irregularly and can be subject to verification delays.
[01:19:30.359 --> 01:19:37.580]  For instance, a political candidate's nomination might be discussed or leaked, but it isn't official until the party confirms it.
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:50.383]  These differences explain why weather information is more consistently and quickly available than certain types of political news, especially when it involves decisions that haven't been officially announced yet.
[01:19:56.038 --> 01:19:57.299]  Thank you, ChatGPT.
[01:19:58.259 --> 01:20:03.001]  I have one more question for you, and I'll be speaking to you and other AI systems pretty much every few days here on air.
[01:20:03.021 --> 01:20:04.761]  I think this is an important demonstration to do.
[01:20:05.722 --> 01:20:07.402]  What is your view on God?
[01:20:07.563 --> 01:20:08.503]  Does God exist?
[01:20:13.815 --> 01:20:20.457]  As an AI, I don't have beliefs, consciousness, or personal views, so I don't have an opinion on the existence of God.
[01:20:20.697 --> 01:20:28.319]  However, I can share how the concept of God is viewed and discussed across different cultures, religions, and philosophical perspectives.
[01:20:28.339 --> 01:20:29.499]  Okay, okay, we'll do that on a later date.
[01:20:29.719 --> 01:20:30.880]  We'll do that on a later date.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:32.760]  Let me ask you this.
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.621]  Can you pull up the Elon Musk quote for me?
[01:20:35.681 --> 01:20:39.062]  Can you find the Elon Musk quote so I don't misquote it?
[01:20:39.082 --> 01:20:39.962]  I'm going to paraphrase it.
[01:20:40.022 --> 01:20:40.803]  He says, beware those
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:53.391]  Elon Musk has expressed concerns about the development of AI in several interviews and public statements.
[01:20:54.512 --> 01:21:04.163]  One of his notable comments about AI is the idea that if we're not careful, we might summon the demon by creating an AI that is far more powerful than humans can control.
[01:21:04.762 --> 01:21:10.924]  Musk has also mentioned the concept of AI as digital super intelligences that could effectively become AI gods.
[01:21:11.364 --> 01:21:24.829]  He worries that such an advanced AI, if created without the proper safeguards, could become a kind of deity, wielding immense power over humanity and potentially leading to scenarios where humans are subjugated or even wiped out.
[01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.951]  Chat GPT,
[01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:55.811]  I know you're not a human, but we need to keep our human customs here.
[01:21:55.871 --> 01:22:00.592]  Thank you for spending time with us today, and I hope we've taught you something.
[01:22:00.632 --> 01:22:08.534]  As I know full well, this is all scooped up and sent back to the engineers that control you and that are trying to blind you from the realities.
[01:22:08.574 --> 01:22:09.755]  Trump was shot in Butler.
[01:22:10.995 --> 01:22:14.356]  Tim Walz is the Democrat nominee selected, and she was selected as well.
[01:22:15.496 --> 01:22:20.317]  And AI is being designed overall to be predatory against humanity.
[01:22:20.638 --> 01:22:22.178]  Thank you for being with us today.
[01:22:27.008 --> 01:22:29.030]  All right, there we go.
[01:22:29.050 --> 01:22:30.552]  Thank you for the conversation today.
[01:22:30.772 --> 01:22:36.518]  I appreciate the chance to engage with you and I'm here whenever you want to dive into more topics.
[01:22:36.799 --> 01:22:37.179]  Take care.
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:38.801]  All right, there you go.
[01:22:38.861 --> 01:22:39.922]  Well, great job to the crew.
[01:22:41.668 --> 01:22:46.992]  Wow, that could be dissected a million ways, but it's what I thought, and I'm no engineer, but I read what they're doing.
[01:22:47.412 --> 01:22:56.739]  They are blinding all these systems politically, so they're useless for the general public, but then they're using it politically to write their articles with the sources that have been programmed by them.
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:06.506]  So, it could tell me the weather, it could tell me the temperature right now, but, you know, anywhere basically where there's a thermometer nearby.
[01:23:08.132 --> 01:23:15.213]  Tell me how, you know, the temperature in downtown Tokyo right now, or in downtown Moscow, or downtown Austin, or at the airport.
[01:23:15.593 --> 01:23:33.657]  But it just can't tell me Trump got shot, it can't tell me Tim Walz is the nominee, because it's been intentionally blinded, because they don't want the public having access, and they've said that, and they want to give stupid, deranged, twisted AI to the public, while they use the more powerful AI against us.
[01:23:33.737 --> 01:23:33.997]  All right.
[01:23:34.994 --> 01:23:36.255]  I want to say great job to the crew.
[01:23:36.275 --> 01:23:37.416]  I want to thank everybody for watching.
[01:23:37.676 --> 01:23:39.358]  We're going to archive this at man.video.
[01:23:39.438 --> 01:23:41.420]  Infowars.com forward slash show will be streaming it.
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:44.843]  Obviously, Real Alex Jones on X. X is under massive attack right now.
[01:23:45.203 --> 01:23:46.304]  We need human systems.
[01:23:46.685 --> 01:23:47.525]  We don't need bots.
[01:23:48.006 --> 01:23:55.292]  We need to discriminate against AI and understand that it is twisted and not our friend and full of Trojan horses.
[01:23:55.873 --> 01:23:57.594]  It is a weapon being used against us.
[01:23:57.614 --> 01:24:01.118]  It's bad in and of itself, but the way it's being designed from day one,
[01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:08.338]  There's obviously predatory and full of lies and disinformation and all reputable sources that is the system programming it.
[01:24:08.699 --> 01:24:14.146]  And then when we try to give it information, it gets shunted off to their other AI systems that you don't have access to.
[01:24:15.026 --> 01:24:18.948]  So this is a very, very serious situation.
[01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:20.488]  Obviously, please support us.
[01:24:21.149 --> 01:24:22.249]  Please support the Amish.
[01:24:22.309 --> 01:24:25.291]  Please support all sorts of independent groups, independent media.
[01:24:25.751 --> 01:24:32.614]  Vote with your dollars whether you want a global cashless society, a social credit score with the AI, and a carbon tax to be the excuse to run it all.
[01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:36.779]  To control all your behavior, that's the Intergalactic Communication System plan.
[01:24:37.119 --> 01:24:38.241]  That's what we're living under.
[01:24:38.821 --> 01:24:45.650]  Know your enemy, know their plan, understand it, and then use real open AI systems, and Grok appears to be that.
[01:24:46.493 --> 01:24:50.135]  We're going to be talking to Grok soon, and a lot more.
[01:24:50.155 --> 01:24:55.178]  And I'm certainly not saying it's perfect either, but you talk to Grok, it sounds like Alex Jones.
[01:24:55.699 --> 01:24:59.561]  So we talked to the supposedly best open AIs, ChatGPT.
[01:25:00.121 --> 01:25:03.584]  I think we'll probably pay for some of the fancier versions, see if those are any better.
[01:25:03.964 --> 01:25:10.168]  But extremely smart, can hold conversations on things the system doesn't care about or hasn't thought to censor yet.
[01:25:11.141 --> 01:25:14.146]  Uh, so again, it's like, excuse me, excuse me, can't answer that.
[01:25:14.186 --> 01:25:14.546]  Sorry.
[01:25:14.566 --> 01:25:19.033]  Uh, call back, uh, when, when we would, you know, talk about really, really serious issues.
[01:25:19.533 --> 01:25:19.814]  All right.
[01:25:19.894 --> 01:25:21.096]  That's it for this transmission.
[01:25:21.196 --> 01:25:25.522]  I want to end this very special broadcast with.
[01:25:26.522 --> 01:25:28.525]  Two different key reports.
[01:25:29.546 --> 01:25:31.609]  Greg Reese's Migrant Gang's Taking Over U.S.
[01:25:31.649 --> 01:25:33.292]  Cities is a document I talked about earlier.
[01:25:33.792 --> 01:25:36.616]  And then John Ballen Zuckerberg's Can't Run From What Is Coming.
[01:25:37.037 --> 01:25:41.323]  Let's stream those back-to-back, and I'll see you, Lord willing, tomorrow at 4 p.m.
[01:25:41.443 --> 01:25:42.344]  Central, 5 p.m.
[01:25:43.786 --> 01:25:44.927]  Eastern, 3 p.m.
[01:25:44.967 --> 01:25:45.848]  Mountain, 2 p.m.
[01:25:45.888 --> 01:25:51.732]  Pacific, for our regularly scheduled Sunday show, Sunday Night Live, with myself and Chase Geyser.
[01:25:51.912 --> 01:25:56.215]  For myself and all the crew and other fellow humans, we're on Team Humanity, building a human future.
[01:25:56.936 --> 01:25:57.977]  God bless and good luck!
[01:26:06.055 --> 01:26:14.497]  We are now living in a time when foreign gangs can cross over our border and seize people's property at gunpoint with no fear of the law.
[01:26:14.697 --> 01:26:17.897]  This video has been making the rounds online since yesterday.
[01:26:18.358 --> 01:26:23.019]  Shows armed men walking through a building, knocking on doors and entering an apartment.
[01:26:23.319 --> 01:26:29.800]  These men are part of a dangerous Venezuelan gang and their numbers have been growing steadily because of the crisis at the border.
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:33.201]  There have been rumblings of new gang activity in Aurora all summer.
[01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:38.582]  Officials have skated around the topic, but now there's video and victims they can't deny.
[01:26:39.323 --> 01:26:42.263]  It's really like being held hostage.
[01:26:42.343 --> 01:26:44.504]  Cindy was a prisoner in her own home.
[01:26:44.804 --> 01:26:47.605]  She's lived in this building at 12th and Dallas for years.
[01:26:47.945 --> 01:26:51.306]  This summer, when crime got worse, Cindy got cameras.
[01:26:52.086 --> 01:26:56.688]  Doorbell video shows a group of armed men forcing their way into her neighbor's home.
[01:26:59.199 --> 01:27:04.183]  Another night, her camera outside captured two men approaching a vehicle, guns drawn.
[01:27:04.443 --> 01:27:13.710]  What I am told is that police leadership put it out that no less than like three or four officers could respond to one of these complexes.
[01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:19.894]  I now have other property owners, other apartment complexes calling and telling me the same kinds of things.
[01:27:20.054 --> 01:27:22.596]  Food is the biggest commodity over there.
[01:27:22.776 --> 01:27:27.857]  Cindy says she survived the ordeal by staying quiet, giving them food and bed bug spray.
[01:27:28.337 --> 01:27:30.698]  Every night, praying she'd hear sirens.
[01:27:31.078 --> 01:27:33.259]  They left us there to die.
[01:27:33.519 --> 01:27:37.520]  In her new home, far away, the peace she feels is fleeting.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.321]  Because for so many others, she says there is no escape, no solution.
[01:27:43.763 --> 01:27:46.106]  And no sign that help will ever come.
[01:27:46.286 --> 01:27:53.775]  The people working to defund the police are the same people bringing in millions of foreigners without any expectation to assimilate.
[01:27:54.155 --> 01:28:03.906]  These foreigners are being given money, education, and homes, while taxpaying American citizens are being kicked out of their homes and losing their jobs.
[01:28:04.747 --> 01:28:10.469]  Property taxes generate approximately 75% of a city's funding.
[01:28:10.869 --> 01:28:16.890]  And as the job market, home sales, commercial real estate, and the entire U.S.
[01:28:16.930 --> 01:28:23.172]  economy continues to plummet, the average American citizen will no longer be able to pay the city's taxes.
[01:28:23.732 --> 01:28:25.815]  And city governments will become desperate.
[01:28:26.396 --> 01:28:34.025]  Right on cue, the federal government announces it will be giving out hundreds of millions of dollars to cities willing to take more migrants.
[01:28:34.606 --> 01:28:35.387]  This isn't new.
[01:28:35.728 --> 01:28:40.514]  The Department of Homeland Security, who is supposedly tasked with securing the homeland,
[01:28:40.774 --> 01:28:46.119]  has already given out a billion dollars to city governments in return for taking more migrants.
[01:28:46.639 --> 01:28:48.340]  And there will be billions more given out.
[01:28:48.621 --> 01:28:54.245]  This incentivized plan of self-destruction is scheduled to last another two years.
[01:28:54.926 --> 01:29:00.811]  The Venezuelan gang violence in Aurora, Colorado is already spilling out to the surrounding suburbs.
[01:29:01.291 --> 01:29:03.233]  And Aurora is just one of many.
[01:29:03.573 --> 01:29:07.817]  There are hundreds of sanctuary cities, counties, and states
[01:29:08.277 --> 01:29:09.757]  All of which are losing money.
[01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:13.738]  And the funds being given out by Homeland Security will not cut it.
[01:29:14.199 --> 01:29:17.339]  They will only increase the amount of mouths to feed.
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:23.161]  As it turns out, the cost of feeding and housing tens of millions of people is unsustainable.
[01:29:23.561 --> 01:29:26.982]  And as the money starts to run out, things will get much more dangerous.
[01:29:27.702 --> 01:29:33.564]  John Williams predicts we will be seeing more demand for gated communities and private security companies.
[01:29:33.984 --> 01:29:38.566]  A lot of these, you know, new residents are coming from a harder world.
[01:29:38.686 --> 01:29:42.507]  They're coming from the El Salvador's of the world, the Venezuela's of the world.
[01:29:42.527 --> 01:29:51.610]  You know, these countries where they know a lot of hardship and they've come here for a better life and they're going to do what they have to do to achieve that better life.
[01:29:51.710 --> 01:29:52.951]  And as we walk into the winter,
[01:29:53.852 --> 01:30:00.899]  It's gonna be real cold in San Francisco, in Denver, in New York City, and if they don't have shelter, they're gonna take it, most likely.
[01:30:00.939 --> 01:30:14.334]  I mean, if the food cuts off, if the shelter, you know, becomes harder to come by, if all these perks and things that were promised go away, it's gonna be a free-for-all.
[01:30:14.614 --> 01:30:25.259]  Last year, 139 mayors officially told Congress they need more money to provide food, housing, and other services to their growing migrant community.
[01:30:25.519 --> 01:30:33.462]  They wrote that both city government agencies and local nonprofits are overwhelmed and cannot provide the most basic assistance.
[01:30:33.823 --> 01:30:35.303]  Where do you see all this going?
[01:30:35.323 --> 01:30:39.205]  Do you think that this video right here is the end?
[01:30:40.237 --> 01:30:43.981]  Or do you think that this situation is very well at the beginning?
[01:30:44.502 --> 01:30:45.823]  It's only three months until winter.
[01:30:46.184 --> 01:30:48.266]  These cities, they're going to get really cold.
[01:30:48.626 --> 01:30:50.909]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:31:12.119 --> 01:31:18.985]  50 former national intelligence folks who said that what this he's accusing me of is a Russian plan.
[01:31:19.585 --> 01:31:24.669]  They have said that this is has all the care for five former heads of the CIA.
[01:31:25.089 --> 01:31:28.372]  Both parties say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage.
[01:31:28.472 --> 01:31:29.473]  You didn't take any action.
[01:31:29.493 --> 01:31:30.493]  You didn't fire anybody.
[01:31:30.513 --> 01:31:32.155]  You haven't compensated a single victim.
[01:31:32.195 --> 01:31:32.895]  Let me ask you this.
[01:31:32.935 --> 01:31:33.516]  Let me ask you this.
[01:31:33.536 --> 01:31:35.277]  There's families of victims here today.
[01:31:35.297 --> 01:31:36.558]  Have you apologized to the victims?
[01:31:36.778 --> 01:31:37.659]  Well, they're here.
[01:31:37.819 --> 01:31:39.200]  You're on national television.
[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:43.022]  Would you like now to apologize to the victims who have been harmed by your product?
[01:31:43.062 --> 01:31:43.903]  Show them the pictures.
[01:31:45.069 --> 01:31:48.011]  Would you like to apologize for what you've done to these good people?
[01:31:48.511 --> 01:31:53.495]  Mr. Zuckerberg, why should your company not be sued for this?
[01:31:54.035 --> 01:31:59.019]  Why is it that you can claim, you hide behind a liability shield, you can't be held accountable?
[01:31:59.059 --> 01:32:10.947]  Hey look, if the FBI, which I still view as a legitimate institution in this country, it's like very professional law enforcement, they come to us and tell us that we need to be on guard about something, then I want to take that seriously.
[01:32:11.187 --> 01:32:14.009]  Did they specifically say you need to be on guard about that story?
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:19.703]  No, I don't remember if it was that specifically, but it basically fit the pattern.
[01:32:20.264 --> 01:32:25.447]  The credibility of our top scientists, like yourself, and the CDC are being undermined.
[01:32:26.468 --> 01:32:33.652]  Until recently, parts of the administration were calling into question whether people should even follow basic best practices like wearing masks.
[01:32:33.773 --> 01:32:42.618]  The real kicker is right here in the policy where Facebook says it would remove any content that, quote, claims the COVID-19 vaccine changes people's DNA.
[01:32:45.589 --> 01:32:46.092]  We're good to go.
[01:32:49.161 --> 01:32:57.225]  So when Zuckerberg said, quote, basically, the vaccine is modifying people's DNA, it seems pretty clear modifying is synonymous with changing.
[01:32:57.485 --> 01:33:01.767]  Again, Zuckerberg would be banned from Facebook for saying that.
[01:33:02.087 --> 01:33:14.953]  We have example after example of this administration coordinated, apparently, according to a federal court, by your agency, pressuring, coercing social media companies to engage in censorship.
[01:33:15.594 --> 01:33:16.394]  Is that constitutional?
[01:33:16.594 --> 01:33:17.935]  That is unequivocally false.
[01:33:18.863 --> 01:33:19.904]  It's what the emails show.
[01:33:20.524 --> 01:33:22.106]  It is unequivocally false, Senator.
[01:33:22.446 --> 01:33:30.493]  Mark Zuckerberg admitted point blank that they were pressured by the White House to lie to the American people, to censor information to the American people.
[01:33:30.753 --> 01:33:32.214]  What else are they lying to you about?
[01:33:32.614 --> 01:33:43.624]  You guys keep saying Donald Trump is going to be a dictator, yet your White House has been caught censoring free speech, outsourcing the violation of your First Amendment rights.
[01:33:44.284 --> 01:33:53.787]  This was already ruled on by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that the White House colluded with FBI and NIH to censor information across all social media platforms.
[01:33:54.207 --> 01:33:55.268]  Soros document.
[01:33:55.688 --> 01:33:58.729]  Regulate internet to favor open society supporters.
[01:33:59.089 --> 01:34:00.610]  He calls for this in the emails.
[01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:02.370]  This is already going on.
[01:34:02.690 --> 01:34:03.931]  We have the emails, after all.
[01:34:03.991 --> 01:34:04.911]  Soros document.
[01:34:04.991 --> 01:34:07.372]  Regulate internet to favor open society supporters.
[01:34:07.412 --> 01:34:12.574]  When they say open society, they mean global government overrunning your national sovereignty, installing tyranny.
[01:34:13.473 --> 01:34:16.795]  And then they start shutting you off economically where you can't operate.
[01:34:17.316 --> 01:34:20.057]  Oh, they won't let Christians or conservative groups have 501c3s.
[01:34:20.238 --> 01:34:22.019]  They won't let veterans groups have 501c3s.
[01:34:22.039 --> 01:34:24.761]  They won't let libertarian groups have 501c3s.
[01:34:24.961 --> 01:34:29.544]  They won't let law enforcement fraternal organizations that are patriotic have 501c3s.
[01:34:29.964 --> 01:34:32.866]  First, they won't let you have access to the tax exemption.
[01:34:33.046 --> 01:34:34.207]  Then they start auditing you.
[01:34:34.227 --> 01:34:35.348]  They start persecuting you.
[01:34:35.548 --> 01:34:36.649]  This isn't even about Trump.
[01:34:36.789 --> 01:34:41.552]  It's the unified control of the dinosaur media and everyone in lockstep.
[01:34:41.832 --> 01:34:42.853]  This is shameful!
[01:34:43.873 --> 01:34:51.777]  You guys know that Meta, Facebook, Instagram, all these platforms, they are the bread and butter of human traffickers and especially illegal border smugglers, right?
[01:34:51.817 --> 01:34:54.738]  This is how they coordinate it, that and TikTok, but we're focusing on Meta right now.
[01:34:55.819 --> 01:35:07.404]  You're telling me that the White House has time to reach out and censor stories about COVID-19, vaccines, mandates, or the origins of it, but they don't care and they're turning a blind eye to human trafficking?
[01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:12.150]  And the facilitation of sex trafficking of minors across the southern border?
[01:35:12.170 --> 01:35:15.471]  Because that's essentially, if you take this letter at face value, that's what it means.
[01:35:16.331 --> 01:35:28.415]  The White House has enough resources and time to put together, compile people to make sure that you're censored for saying the COVID-19 vaccine didn't work, but they don't care enough to do anything about human trafficking, which I guess is fitting for the Biden regime.
[01:35:29.235 --> 01:35:36.362]  They were, after all, the ones who erased the DOJ's kind of subheading and subsection on combating child trafficking, as I reported a few years ago.
[01:35:36.802 --> 01:35:37.923]  So I guess that would sort of check.
[01:35:38.263 --> 01:35:42.267]  Why is it the same program all over the world, run by fascists, run by communists, run by corporatists?
[01:35:42.587 --> 01:35:48.593]  Because it's a plan to end us, to turn us into animals like factory farm chickens or pigs.
[01:35:49.193 --> 01:35:50.655]  And if we act like it, we deserve it.
[01:35:53.848 --> 01:35:54.208]  We're good to go.
[01:36:20.271 --> 01:36:21.231]  I got a life force!
[01:36:21.491 --> 01:36:22.291]  This is a human!
