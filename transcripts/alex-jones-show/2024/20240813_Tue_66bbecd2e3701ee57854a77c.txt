[00:00:01.078 --> 00:00:06.902]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:08.183 --> 00:00:12.545]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:25.874]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Tuesday, August 13, 2024, and Musk and Trump knocked it out of the park with over a billion viewers.
[00:00:25.914 --> 00:00:27.015]  We're going to break it down.
[00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:34.277]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:34.297 --> 00:00:37.239]  A critical juncture for the country.
[00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:45.525]  And, you know, I think a lot of people thought, you know, the Biden administration would be a moderate administration, but it's not.
[00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:48.487]  And obviously, we're just going to see a
[00:00:50.408 --> 00:00:56.870]  And even further left administration with Kamala, that's my honest opinion.
[00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.012]  I mean, her dad is literally, I mean, she was brought up as an actual, her dad is a Marxist economist.
[00:01:04.052 --> 00:01:05.152]  That's, you can Google it.
[00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:07.553]  I mean, it's not a, we're not making this up, you know.
[00:01:08.793 --> 00:01:09.713]  That's how she was brought up.
[00:01:09.953 --> 00:01:14.875]  So, and we just, we want to have a future that is prosperous.
[00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:17.415]  And I think we're just at this critical juncture.
[00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:27.099]  I think this is a case of America is at a fork in the road.
[00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.079]  It's true.
[00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:35.582]  I think it will take the path, like you are the path to prosperity and I think Kamala is the opposite.
[00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:37.623]  That's my honest opinion.
[00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:39.424]  I'm going to get attacked like crazy.
[00:01:39.984 --> 00:01:42.065]  I've also experienced quite a bit of lawfare myself.
[00:01:44.012 --> 00:01:50.276]  But I'm just trying to tell people my honest opinion, and I haven't been really active in politics before.
[00:01:50.296 --> 00:01:56.281]  And I'm just trying to point out that my track record historically has been moderate, if not moderate, slightly left.
[00:01:57.241 --> 00:02:04.386]  And so this is to people out there who are in the moderate camp to say, I think you should support Donald Trump for president.
[00:02:05.787 --> 00:02:11.628]  And I think it's actually a very important junction in the road, and we're in deep trouble if it goes the other way.
[00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:13.089]  Well, I want to thank you.
[00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:25.692]  I mean, the assassination attempt, which was an incredible thing, and I have to say that your actions at that assassination attempt were inspiring.
[00:02:27.152 --> 00:02:30.413]  You know, instead of shying away from things, instead of ducking down,
[00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:34.113]  You were popping your fist in the air and saying, fight, fight, fight.
[00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:41.297]  And I think that's, I mean, you know, the president of the United States represents America.
[00:02:41.537 --> 00:02:46.000]  And I think that is, that is America, that is strength under fire.
[00:02:46.798 --> 00:03:03.364]  And so that's, you know, a big, you know, part of the reason why I was excited to endorse you as the President of the United States for having another term here is that was that was just incredibly inspiring.
[00:03:03.404 --> 00:03:06.045]  But I mean, what was it like for you?
[00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.944]  Not pleasant, I have to be honest.
[00:03:14.504 --> 00:03:16.286]  I didn't know I had that much blood.
[00:03:16.646 --> 00:03:23.912]  The doctors later told me that the ear is a place that is a very bloody place if you're going to get hit.
[00:03:24.632 --> 00:03:34.520]  But in this case, it was probably the best alternative you could even think about because it went at the right angle and, you know, it was a hard hit.
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.141]  It was very
[00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:38.709]  I guess you would say surreal, but it wasn't surreal.
[00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:47.691]  You know, I was telling somebody you have instances like this or like a lot less than this where you feel it's a surreal situation.
[00:03:48.192 --> 00:03:49.332]  And I never felt that way.
[00:03:49.532 --> 00:03:52.993]  I knew immediately that it was a bullet.
[00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:56.354]  I knew immediately that it was at the ear.
[00:03:56.374 --> 00:03:56.454]  Yeah.
[00:03:57.614 --> 00:04:00.355]  And because it, you know, it hit very hard, but hit the ear.
[00:04:01.635 --> 00:04:03.096]  And I also heard people
[00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:10.289]  Shout bullets, bullets, you know, get down, get down because I, you know, I moved down pretty nicely, pretty quickly.
[00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.491]  And we had bullets flying right over my head after I went down.
[00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:14.572]  So I'm glad I went down.
[00:04:15.312 --> 00:04:18.895]  The bigger miracle was that I was looking in the exact direction of the shooter.
[00:04:18.915 --> 00:04:25.379]  And so it hit, it hit me at an angle that was far less destructive than any other angle.
[00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:26.399]  So that was the miracle.
[00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:32.403]  That was, for those people that don't believe in God, I think we got to all start thinking about that.
[00:04:32.463 --> 00:04:32.904]  You have to,
[00:04:34.013 --> 00:04:35.614]  You know, I'm a believer.
[00:04:35.674 --> 00:04:37.275]  Now I'm more of a believer, I think.
[00:04:37.335 --> 00:04:38.656]  And a lot of people have said that to me.
[00:04:38.676 --> 00:04:40.738]  A lot of great people have said that to me, actually.
[00:04:41.398 --> 00:04:45.781]  But it was amazing that I happened to be turned just at that perfect angle.
[00:04:46.673 --> 00:04:55.177]  And all because I put down a chart on immigration that showed that the numbers were... All right, we have just so many amazing clips from last night.
[00:04:55.197 --> 00:04:57.498]  We have a very special guest that's going to expose the deep state.
[00:04:58.138 --> 00:05:03.200]  And so much news, so much today on this Live Tuesday, August 13th broadcast.
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.961]  Thank you for being part of the Infowars family.
[00:05:05.341 --> 00:05:07.202]  Thanks for praying for us and thanks for your support.
[00:05:07.582 --> 00:05:09.923]  We're barely hanging on, but thanks to you, we're still here.
[00:05:10.263 --> 00:05:10.924]  Please stay with us.
[00:05:11.264 --> 00:05:13.525]  We're coming to you from the embattled Infowars
[00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:18.668]  The main show with Elon Musk, the two-hour interview with Musk and Trump, got over a billion
[00:05:44.335 --> 00:05:44.755]  Clicks.
[00:05:46.056 --> 00:05:46.956]  That's not views.
[00:05:47.036 --> 00:05:49.437]  That's not just looking at it on the screen or going past it.
[00:05:51.218 --> 00:05:54.299]  A billion people clicked on it.
[00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:00.681]  And the numbers are coming out that the average time spent listening on there was over an hour.
[00:06:01.681 --> 00:06:05.043]  For those that don't know, if you got people listening to radio for 20 minutes, that's great.
[00:06:05.083 --> 00:06:06.023]  That's time spent listening.
[00:06:07.782 --> 00:06:09.723]  We added a video element to it last night.
[00:06:10.184 --> 00:06:13.466]  Some of the crew worked a 18-hour day yesterday.
[00:06:13.526 --> 00:06:15.927]  We didn't get out of here until, what, 11 o'clock at night.
[00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:19.750]  And some of the crew was here at 6 a.m.
[00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.651]  So we salute the crew.
[00:06:23.092 --> 00:06:27.015]  Just incredible job by Elon Musk and Trump.
[00:06:27.915 --> 00:06:33.379]  CNN, The Washington Post, the EU, and Elon talked about this.
[00:06:34.785 --> 00:06:36.627]  All tried to suppress it.
[00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:40.352]  There was a massive DDoS attack against X itself.
[00:06:41.753 --> 00:06:43.375]  Even our video streams went down.
[00:06:44.216 --> 00:06:52.967]  Not just their X speakers system, or X spaces, but
[00:06:54.601 --> 00:06:56.101]  45 minutes late, they got it up.
[00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:59.002]  And Kamala and, of course, all of them had their talking points.
[00:06:59.042 --> 00:07:07.263]  I said last night, even before it began, I was saying that, you know, there's any technical stuff, because this is a huge technology.
[00:07:07.663 --> 00:07:09.084]  You're not just clicking a stream.
[00:07:09.164 --> 00:07:10.144]  You're in it.
[00:07:10.224 --> 00:07:11.544]  You're able to raise your hand.
[00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:13.144]  They're able to bring you on.
[00:07:13.164 --> 00:07:15.125]  There's a huge interface there.
[00:07:15.165 --> 00:07:16.045]  You're not just on a stream.
[00:07:16.105 --> 00:07:17.125]  It's way more complex.
[00:07:17.945 --> 00:07:22.566]  And they're trying to add a video element, which we're able to do here, but not on that scale.
[00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:26.095]  We had several million people tune into our stream.
[00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:28.958]  Obviously, our group streams, one stream has 1.5, 1.6.
[00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:32.342]  Last time I checked, the other had about 800,000, so you can do the numbers there.
[00:07:32.362 --> 00:07:36.006]  But that was a nice little 2 million extra little folks, wonderful people tuning in.
[00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:39.330]  And we had about half a million tuned in on info or streams.
[00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.831]  We're good to go.
[00:07:57.287 --> 00:07:58.848]  Because I wrote it just like 15 minutes ago.
[00:07:58.868 --> 00:08:00.390]  We'll put it on screen.
[00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:08.917]  Tuesday live, Elon Musk's Trump interview reaches over a billion people, devastating MSM like a giant asteroid killing the dinosaurs.
[00:08:09.538 --> 00:08:10.679]  Must watch Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:22.530]  Now look, the corporate media is propped up, but there's thousands of channels, TV and radio and print, and so they're still able to all put out the same message at once and still have some effect.
[00:08:24.281 --> 00:08:26.002]  But by themselves, they have no power.
[00:08:26.102 --> 00:08:28.023]  CNN's biggest shows have a million viewers.
[00:08:29.443 --> 00:08:33.825]  I can shoot a video in my backyard and do it all the time, and it gets, you know, 3 million views, 5 million, 10 million.
[00:08:33.845 --> 00:08:35.846]  I mean, most of them, a million views.
[00:08:35.866 --> 00:08:39.568]  I can literally just sit there, get out of bed, shoot a video, a million views.
[00:08:39.608 --> 00:08:40.968]  Like, piece of cake.
[00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:42.389]  If I promote it, 10 million.
[00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:49.012]  So, again, and I'm just one person, so with a phone or a laptop,
[00:08:50.646 --> 00:08:55.548]  Or a desktop, I can reach more people and never get out of my pajamas.
[00:08:57.109 --> 00:09:01.491]  Of course, I don't wear pajamas, but that's kind of a northern thing down here.
[00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:04.112]  But I get it.
[00:09:04.132 --> 00:09:05.612]  You're freezing up in Minnesota, you wear pajamas.
[00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:06.953]  In Texas, we sleep naked.
[00:09:06.973 --> 00:09:07.573]  It's a little secret.
[00:09:08.614 --> 00:09:10.234]  But at least I do.
[00:09:10.314 --> 00:09:11.335]  I go commando in the bed.
[00:09:11.795 --> 00:09:13.536]  But I'm digressing.
[00:09:16.954 --> 00:09:18.955]  This is a huge, huge deal.
[00:09:19.776 --> 00:09:28.980]  When I was on a Spaces with Elon, and I've been on some others as well, but we interviewed each other for over two hours, it got 25 million live.
[00:09:30.021 --> 00:09:32.842]  And then the derivatives and versions of it, you couldn't even count it.
[00:09:32.882 --> 00:09:34.843]  I mean, 100 million, very conservative number.
[00:09:34.903 --> 00:09:39.346]  I mean, just on my channel, clips we put out reach like 30, 40 million conservatively.
[00:09:39.366 --> 00:09:40.286]  I mean, very conservatively.
[00:09:40.306 --> 00:09:41.747]  So I can't keep track of it.
[00:09:41.787 --> 00:09:42.427]  It's everywhere.
[00:09:43.048 --> 00:09:43.668]  It's still everywhere.
[00:09:44.809 --> 00:09:45.009]  So,
[00:09:46.773 --> 00:09:50.034]  Imagine what that means that CNN has thousands of employees.
[00:09:51.595 --> 00:09:53.715]  At least, it's well over a thousand still even though they're downsized.
[00:09:55.196 --> 00:09:55.916]  And contractors.
[00:09:56.756 --> 00:09:57.877]  I mean, just CNN in the U.S.
[00:09:57.937 --> 00:09:59.377]  Actually, I think international's even bigger.
[00:09:59.417 --> 00:10:03.218]  I think they've got like... Guys, look up how many employees CNN globally has.
[00:10:03.238 --> 00:10:08.340]  I know it's thousands, so... Big, huge buildings all over the world.
[00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:16.638]  Thousands of employees, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of writers and reporters, and their top shows might hit a million.
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.224]  Put that in context, Lou Dobbs would have 15 million viewers back in his heyday on CNN.
[00:10:23.644 --> 00:10:25.906]  Because he ran CNN too, he wasn't just the top host.
[00:10:26.727 --> 00:10:27.968]  So he knew what to do programming-wise.
[00:10:27.988 --> 00:10:29.429]  He had debates, liberal and conservative.
[00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.490]  And libertarian.
[00:10:31.391 --> 00:10:32.012]  But I digress.
[00:10:33.173 --> 00:10:33.974]  What I'm saying here is,
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:40.162]  When you have weekend at Bernie's and you're kind of carrying a dead body around, people finally figure out it's a dead body.
[00:10:40.202 --> 00:10:42.183]  Well, the corporate media has been dead for a long time.
[00:10:43.043 --> 00:10:48.366]  Their last power is they can all get together and put out, you know, a few big lies a day.
[00:10:49.606 --> 00:10:54.508]  Like, oh, actually Biden has a plan to get rid of taxes on tips.
[00:10:54.548 --> 00:10:57.549]  No, he actually increased taxes on them and regulation and harassment.
[00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:02.512]  Or Kamala's repeating that Trump, you know, loves everybody at the
[00:11:05.422 --> 00:11:06.503]  Rally in Virginia.
[00:11:07.203 --> 00:11:07.903]  Charlottesville.
[00:11:08.363 --> 00:11:09.004]  He never said that.
[00:11:09.344 --> 00:11:10.584]  Or Trump hates all Mexicans.
[00:11:10.604 --> 00:11:11.265]  They're still saying that.
[00:11:11.425 --> 00:11:11.945]  Where's the clip?
[00:11:11.965 --> 00:11:12.445]  Doesn't exist.
[00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:13.386]  Nothing even close.
[00:11:14.826 --> 00:11:18.048]  But they can still just all get together and say, he hates Mexicans.
[00:11:18.368 --> 00:11:19.708]  People, well, I heard he hates Mexicans.
[00:11:19.748 --> 00:11:19.988]  Really?
[00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:23.610]  I mean, you should hate who told you that that's lying to you.
[00:11:25.391 --> 00:11:29.873]  Or Alex Jones peed on graves and was mean to Sandy Hook people and made up all this stuff.
[00:11:31.289 --> 00:11:32.290]  Never did anything they said.
[00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.470]  The internet didn't believe it.
[00:11:34.311 --> 00:11:34.931]  Huge story.
[00:11:34.951 --> 00:11:37.813]  A few times I said, yeah, it could be fake.
[00:11:37.853 --> 00:11:38.353]  I mean, who knows?
[00:11:38.373 --> 00:11:39.194]  They lied to us so much.
[00:11:41.055 --> 00:11:42.075]  Oh, a billion and a half dollars.
[00:11:42.095 --> 00:11:42.936]  Rigged court cases.
[00:11:44.437 --> 00:11:46.018]  And then in hindsight, I think it did happen.
[00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:47.779]  And then they sued me once I said I thought it happened.
[00:11:47.799 --> 00:11:54.163]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, the point is, is the corporate media is as dead as the dinosaurs.
[00:11:55.123 --> 00:11:57.044]  Now, they've not been extinct for 25 million years.
[00:12:00.254 --> 00:12:03.538]  Or 18 million, whatever they're guessing at when the asteroid hit.
[00:12:04.178 --> 00:12:04.559]  I forget.
[00:12:04.899 --> 00:12:11.166]  How long ago did the giant asteroid hit the Yucatan Peninsula down there in the Caribbean?
[00:12:11.346 --> 00:12:12.167]  What's the Caribbean today?
[00:12:12.548 --> 00:12:18.314]  Guys, look up how long ago the dinosaur extinction 30 mile wide meteor hit.
[00:12:19.415 --> 00:12:20.977]  And they know because they can find the isotopes from it.
[00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:26.283]  There's a big giant, one of the deepest parts of the oceans right there where, you know, the crater's at.
[00:12:26.684 --> 00:12:29.325]  It's basically the Gulf of Mexico is the crater from a son of a bitch.
[00:12:30.546 --> 00:12:45.295]  That's how powerful it was, and then it created decades of, you know, no sunlight, so the earth all froze, and, you know, that wasn't good for creatures that are cold-blooded, but... The dinosaur media didn't die 18 million years ago.
[00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:53.630]  Or 66 million years ago, or whatever number they come up with.
[00:12:54.671 --> 00:13:01.835]  They died... I'd have to say... When Trump got elected in 2016, you could stick a fork in them.
[00:13:02.496 --> 00:13:03.917]  So they've been dead about 8 years.
[00:13:06.979 --> 00:13:19.487]  But if people still think... It's even media, when all it is is a PR operation... That just regurgitate BS all day... Then... It still has some power, but...
[00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:25.681]  You know, I made this point to Joe a couple years ago on his show, and he's repeated it since.
[00:13:25.701 --> 00:13:26.261]  He agreed with it.
[00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:28.702]  I said, why do you keep obsessing on CNN?
[00:13:29.943 --> 00:13:33.744]  Your average show has 20 million viewers, conservatively.
[00:13:34.104 --> 00:13:35.585]  Your bigger shows, 50 million.
[00:13:35.605 --> 00:13:40.467]  Your biggest, 100 million, like the ones I've done, when you add it all together.
[00:13:41.227 --> 00:13:45.169]  Why are you even caring when their biggest show has a million viewers?
[00:13:45.209 --> 00:13:45.729]  That's still what it is.
[00:13:45.749 --> 00:13:46.870]  It's been that for five, six years.
[00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:47.490]  That's their top.
[00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:53.152]  You know, there's an earthquake or some big event, you know, they have more tune in here and there, but that's it.
[00:13:54.013 --> 00:13:58.417]  Sometimes they have 10 million viewers, you know, there's a war starts for like a day, they've got a big audience, but that's it.
[00:13:59.878 --> 00:14:01.359]  But it's transitory, it's not all the time.
[00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:04.702]  So why do we sit there and act like these people are so important?
[00:14:05.983 --> 00:14:12.388]  And still the old politicians, especially the Republicans, they still put stock in what the media says, the corporate media.
[00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:14.971]  You want to be attacked by CNN.
[00:14:15.691 --> 00:14:17.513]  You want to be attacked by ABC-ness.
[00:14:18.826 --> 00:14:31.516]  Again, I've been to three restaurants this week, all three times with, it doesn't usually happen like this, but with my youngest and my middle daughter, and my sister.
[00:14:32.557 --> 00:14:38.222]  And so I've been to three restaurants in the last seven days, and you know what happened every time I was in a restaurant?
[00:14:43.578 --> 00:14:44.479]  People walked over.
[00:14:44.499 --> 00:14:45.581]  This was the weirdest part.
[00:14:45.601 --> 00:14:46.181]  This happens all the time.
[00:14:46.201 --> 00:14:47.083]  Usually, they just get the check.
[00:14:47.583 --> 00:14:52.830]  They just walk over all three times and handed me a $100 bill.
[00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:56.094]  And I'm like, well, thank you.
[00:14:56.775 --> 00:14:57.717]  They say, well, you bet.
[00:15:01.124 --> 00:15:06.547]  Rocky Erickson's brother did it in Kirby Lane yesterday, or two days ago.
[00:15:07.167 --> 00:15:08.328]  I was in there at like 8 a.m.
[00:15:08.348 --> 00:15:16.652]  with my sister and my youngest daughter eating breakfast, and he just comes over and says, hey, I love you, love the work you do.
[00:15:16.853 --> 00:15:17.693]  He knows my parents.
[00:15:18.253 --> 00:15:19.334]  That's Rocky Erickson's brother.
[00:15:19.354 --> 00:15:20.434]  He's a well-known musician.
[00:15:20.915 --> 00:15:21.395]  Really nice guy.
[00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:25.837]  He doesn't mind that, he's a listener.
[00:15:25.857 --> 00:15:29.099]  I know my parents have told me that, but the point is, you know, it's just one of the people who gave me a hundred bucks.
[00:15:29.879 --> 00:15:31.900]  And I don't look at that as like, oh look, I got a hundred bucks, aren't I lucky?
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.622]  The point is, they've tried to make me the biggest devil on earth.
[00:15:37.723 --> 00:15:48.028]  So, this billion plus viewers and listeners of the X Spaces with Trump and Musk last night, and the fact that I've been in a restaurant three times this week,
[00:15:49.542 --> 00:15:50.282]  Last seven days.
[00:15:51.002 --> 00:15:53.263]  And every time I'm given a $100 bill, it's like magic.
[00:15:53.303 --> 00:15:55.084]  It's like Lucky Charms or something.
[00:15:56.984 --> 00:16:02.946]  It just shows that they've done everything they can to destroy me and demonize me and say I'm all these horrible things that I'm not.
[00:16:09.728 --> 00:16:14.050]  And... It hasn't worked.
[00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.431]  So I harp on this Trump billion views,
[00:16:20.492 --> 00:16:25.854]  And I harp on what's happening in Infowars being so popular just to let everybody know who's out there isolated, and I get it.
[00:16:26.354 --> 00:16:28.195]  You're not famous, which is a great thing, by the way.
[00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:31.656]  There's some benefits, but a lot of downsides.
[00:16:31.696 --> 00:16:32.436]  I'm like, oh, I'm famous.
[00:16:32.456 --> 00:16:32.896]  Everybody knows me.
[00:16:33.116 --> 00:16:35.677]  But again, I get to really see what the public thinks.
[00:16:37.578 --> 00:16:43.600]  I was out in San Francisco on business and covering Bohemian Grove a month ago, as you know, when Trump got shot.
[00:16:44.631 --> 00:16:55.461]  And I mean, I'm in the middle of wine country, and people on a farm rentin' a house, and people are running out of the bushes that live three doors down, that saw me on air and could tell the topography and knew I was there.
[00:16:56.082 --> 00:17:02.208]  You know, I mean, I go at a gas station, a grocery store, almost everybody's a listener.
[00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.030]  San Francisco Airport.
[00:17:06.732 --> 00:17:08.514]  Nothing but love, except one guy got in my face.
[00:17:10.077 --> 00:17:13.660]  And then literally three people right there getting on the plane go, we love you, we think you're great.
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.762]  And the guy literally started crying that was calling me a scumbag.
[00:17:17.222 --> 00:17:18.043]  Because he was like, what?
[00:17:18.263 --> 00:17:22.987]  Because he's like, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, you piece of crap, hate your family, you know, all this other stuff.
[00:17:23.027 --> 00:17:26.809]  You're just disgusting, all the things you've done, what you did to those children.
[00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.431]  And I'm just like, I love you.
[00:17:28.671 --> 00:17:29.111]  I love you.
[00:17:29.932 --> 00:17:30.372]  I love you.
[00:17:31.753 --> 00:17:32.354]  That's what I do now.
[00:17:32.374 --> 00:17:33.975]  I've trained myself not to say anything mean back.
[00:17:33.995 --> 00:17:36.297]  And he goes, why don't you?
[00:17:36.437 --> 00:17:37.197]  Why aren't you?
[00:17:37.217 --> 00:17:39.239]  I said, I said, he goes, why do you love me?
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:53.887]  All of a sudden these people go, we love you, and they start hugging me, literally, and, and, and, yeah, we think you're amazing and all this stuff, and the guy starts tearing up, because he came over to make me feel bad, and I said, I love you.
[00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.307]  He goes, why?
[00:17:55.708 --> 00:17:56.048]  Why?
[00:17:56.088 --> 00:17:59.249]  And I said, I love the attacks, because it means I'm fighting evil.
[00:17:59.469 --> 00:18:02.071]  All of a sudden, we love you, we think you're amazing, oh!
[00:18:04.372 --> 00:18:06.453]  What really got him was the black lady hugging me.
[00:18:09.175 --> 00:18:10.556]  Like a white guy, a white lady, and a black lady.
[00:18:10.576 --> 00:18:12.756]  Just totally getting on the plane, in the line to get on.
[00:18:12.776 --> 00:18:17.538]  This guy comes over, you know, where you're lined up, and there's chairs right here, and he just leans over and is talking crap at me.
[00:18:18.839 --> 00:18:20.620]  And the exchange only took like 30 seconds.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.862]  And he literally... Yeah, you just had your illusion fall down!
[00:18:27.182 --> 00:18:36.326]  You see Satan, because HBO put out this completely fake, all of its totalized crap, and you think you've got a chance to come up to the bad man.
[00:18:37.455 --> 00:18:42.400]  Yeah, I lied about WMDs in Iraq and tripled the sanctions and starved two and a half million people to death, a million kids.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.261]  Yeah, I opened the borders up.
[00:18:44.361 --> 00:18:45.382]  I shipped the fentanyl in.
[00:18:45.943 --> 00:18:47.084]  I run the giant rape gangs.
[00:18:47.144 --> 00:18:48.565]  I'm starting World War III with Russia.
[00:18:49.766 --> 00:18:51.268]  I'm cutting children's penises off.
[00:18:51.488 --> 00:18:54.311]  Oh no, that's openly, publicly, the government and the system.
[00:18:54.831 --> 00:18:55.992]  No, I'm not doing any of that.
[00:18:56.593 --> 00:18:57.854]  And I sure as hell ain't perfect.
[00:18:58.848 --> 00:19:00.750]  But at the end of the day, I love God and I love justice.
[00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:07.737]  And just because you guys twist a bunch of crap and make a bunch of stuff about Elon Musk or Donald Trump or Alex Jones, the dog ain't hunting.
[00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:11.701]  And people aren't intimidated anymore.
[00:19:12.702 --> 00:19:16.366]  So I got all this news to cover, but just morale-wise, I want people to understand something.
[00:19:17.347 --> 00:19:18.829]  It's not fun fighting these people.
[00:19:20.001 --> 00:19:21.882]  And I got the devil coming after me in other ways.
[00:19:22.002 --> 00:19:23.203]  That's how the devil comes after you.
[00:19:24.044 --> 00:19:26.986]  And, you know, I'm going through major stuff that I don't even spend time on air about.
[00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:33.750]  But I want everybody to realize that I'm getting 99.9% love.
[00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:39.394]  I go munch without anybody getting in my face, anybody attacking me.
[00:19:39.414 --> 00:19:42.656]  And when Trump first got elected, if I was walking the dog, the dog died.
[00:19:42.676 --> 00:19:46.778]  About a year after Trump got elected, people said, you have a dog.
[00:19:46.798 --> 00:19:48.559]  Well, I got so depressed when my 12-year-old
[00:19:50.498 --> 00:19:59.892]  Captain, sweetheart, French Bulldog, he was so athletic, he'd jump like three feet in the air and grab Frisbees, and he would run and jump over walls, and he broke his neck.
[00:20:02.916 --> 00:20:05.721]  Because my parents, their house had this big ball hanging down.
[00:20:07.671 --> 00:20:10.612]  Some kind of thing that my sister would do.
[00:20:10.652 --> 00:20:11.332]  She's a lot younger than me.
[00:20:11.352 --> 00:20:12.792]  She didn't live with him, but she hung it there or whatever.
[00:20:12.812 --> 00:20:17.394]  The point was some kind of exercise ball hanging out of a tree, and he would love to hit it like it was a bulldog.
[00:20:17.514 --> 00:20:18.674]  He'd go, boom, hit it, hit it, hit it.
[00:20:19.174 --> 00:20:22.895]  And then he got on the table once at Easter.
[00:20:23.635 --> 00:20:26.076]  My parents were over at my house, and my mom brought an Easter cake.
[00:20:26.096 --> 00:20:27.316]  She makes this great coconut cake.
[00:20:27.676 --> 00:20:28.417]  Calls it Easter cake.
[00:20:29.377 --> 00:20:32.878]  And it's half-eaten, and we're watching the Ten Commandments, a ritual we do almost every year.
[00:20:33.518 --> 00:20:34.598]  Charlton Hudson, God love him.
[00:20:35.559 --> 00:20:36.099]  What a great guy.
[00:20:41.772 --> 00:20:43.153]  He's up on top of the table eating it.
[00:20:43.693 --> 00:20:44.913]  And I yelled at him, Captain!
[00:20:44.933 --> 00:20:47.535]  And he jumped off and broke his neck.
[00:20:48.535 --> 00:20:51.496]  And man, I still have nightmares about yelling at him.
[00:20:51.516 --> 00:20:55.438]  And it's not my fault that God, he jumped off that table and broke his neck fully.
[00:20:55.458 --> 00:20:58.399]  And when they x-rayed him, they said his neck's been broken a bunch for a while.
[00:20:58.419 --> 00:21:00.340]  A little tough dog, man.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.301]  Because most of them aren't that athletic.
[00:21:02.341 --> 00:21:04.102]  This one, he was really like a big one.
[00:21:04.782 --> 00:21:06.903]  See, now I'm just... That's what I want to do.
[00:21:06.983 --> 00:21:08.824]  I just want to hang out with French Bulldogs and go fishing.
[00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:11.514]  God, they're little sweethearts, aren't they?
[00:21:12.114 --> 00:21:12.955]  But I haven't gotten another one.
[00:21:13.776 --> 00:21:15.978]  Because I... I just... when he died, it was so terrible.
[00:21:16.878 --> 00:21:20.541]  But... I guess... I'm digressing.
[00:21:24.905 --> 00:21:25.545]  I'm digressing.
[00:21:26.886 --> 00:21:31.430]  But, uh... Anyways, um...
[00:21:32.947 --> 00:21:35.168]  This is a big deal for America and a big deal for the world.
[00:21:36.308 --> 00:21:37.989]  I get really gloom and doom sometimes.
[00:21:38.329 --> 00:21:39.890]  I probably should have just gone off air yesterday.
[00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.311]  I got very down in the third hour.
[00:21:43.551 --> 00:21:46.813]  Just at how evil our enemies are and how out of control they are.
[00:21:47.553 --> 00:21:54.436]  I pledge to you that when I get in those dark spaces,
[00:21:55.427 --> 00:21:56.228]  I'm just going to go off.
[00:21:56.688 --> 00:21:58.429]  And sometimes if I just leave the show, you have to know that.
[00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:02.671]  Because the enemy wants to degrade us.
[00:22:02.691 --> 00:22:03.572]  They want us to give up.
[00:22:03.612 --> 00:22:04.733]  They want us to feel like we're beaten.
[00:22:05.846 --> 00:22:18.770]  And when I get in those type of moods, which doesn't happen a lot, I cannot, because I'm a person that's very, you know, scientific about making decisions, but I'm also, you know, make decisions very coldly, but then I have huge emotions on top of it.
[00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:20.571]  And I'm very truthful about things.
[00:22:21.271 --> 00:22:23.772]  And so if I'm upset, I can't put on an act.
[00:22:24.092 --> 00:22:24.933]  I just, I can't do it.
[00:22:25.913 --> 00:22:34.936]  And, but last night I'm not down and we have to stand up for the children and things are only going to get worse if we don't stand up against the globalist.
[00:22:36.377 --> 00:22:38.918]  Things are only going to get worse if we don't get close to God.
[00:22:39.978 --> 00:22:41.318]  And so, we can't give up.
[00:22:41.458 --> 00:22:44.099]  And look, so much good is happening.
[00:22:44.119 --> 00:22:45.279]  And I'm telling myself that right now.
[00:22:45.299 --> 00:22:48.000]  Remember, so much of this show, folks, is inner dialogue.
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.180]  I'm being honest about that.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.341]  And I just talk about whatever I'm thinking.
[00:22:52.361 --> 00:22:54.401]  That's why I started going off on something about the French Bulldog.
[00:22:55.441 --> 00:22:56.802]  Because that's just where we are.
[00:22:58.638 --> 00:23:04.361]  But the reason I got down yesterday is I look at all this stuff and half the time I can't even cover it.
[00:23:04.381 --> 00:23:16.088]  Because I've already watched the clips, I've already researched it, and it's like, I'm looking at Joe Biden, I'm looking at Netanyahu, I'm looking at these judge videos where you said migrants rape people.
[00:23:16.468 --> 00:23:18.089]  That's the worst thing you can do.
[00:23:18.109 --> 00:23:19.370]  20 months in jail.
[00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:19.990]  That's the quote.
[00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:20.511]  I have the video.
[00:23:21.451 --> 00:23:23.232]  I mean, I got all the statistics.
[00:23:23.252 --> 00:23:25.934]  They commit over 70% of the rapes in every European country.
[00:23:26.752 --> 00:23:27.893]  They're absolute maniacs.
[00:23:27.913 --> 00:23:30.855]  They come from countries where women all wear beekeeper suits.
[00:23:34.979 --> 00:23:46.268]  And the only woman they've ever seen is their mama or their sister, who's probably their sister, or their... I'm not trying to be mean, it's true, but the inbreeding is insane in those areas of Central Asia.
[00:23:46.729 --> 00:23:49.051]  And then they ship in literal inbred cavemen.
[00:23:51.853 --> 00:23:54.856]  And all they've seen online is hardcore porn.
[00:23:56.345 --> 00:24:03.011]  And they've done surveys of the boat people coming in from Somalia and coming in from Afghanistan and Pakistan, and they literally say, what are you coming for?
[00:24:03.211 --> 00:24:04.532]  We're coming for the whores.
[00:24:05.113 --> 00:24:06.354]  We're coming for the white women.
[00:24:07.215 --> 00:24:08.656]  So imagine, they never even get to see women.
[00:24:08.696 --> 00:24:15.962]  Women wear hoods, but they're watching porn, and like Germany's putting ads out that are seen saying, come to Germany, the women want to have sex with you.
[00:24:16.163 --> 00:24:17.244]  I've played these TV shows.
[00:24:17.804 --> 00:24:19.185]  They have them on children's TV.
[00:24:20.684 --> 00:24:26.328]  For targeting eight and nine-year-olds, where it, I've played the clip a lot, guys, I haven't played in like three years.
[00:24:26.929 --> 00:24:32.573]  It's still on YouTube, just type in, German TV tells German teens to have sex with migrants.
[00:24:33.834 --> 00:24:41.399]  And it says, this is Jenny, she's 12, and she's having sex with a 22-year-old from Pakistan.
[00:24:43.281 --> 00:24:48.545]  And then they say in German, you can come here and have sex with our, so the German left is advertising
[00:24:50.103 --> 00:24:54.427]  If you come to Germany or Sweden, you can have sex.
[00:24:55.948 --> 00:25:02.974]  So they show up and in their country, an unaccompanied woman that isn't wearing a hood over their head gets raped.
[00:25:04.876 --> 00:25:06.137]  And then if the woman gets raped,
[00:25:10.316 --> 00:25:16.040]  She either gets acid thrown in her face or stoned to death because it's her fault she got raped.
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:24.325]  So they're literally bringing caveman lunatics into the West and then I've got the guy's name, convicted, everything right here.
[00:25:24.345 --> 00:25:28.528]  They're dealing with hundreds of convictions per court per day, thousands already.
[00:25:29.188 --> 00:25:33.071]  You said on social media that the precious migrants rape people.
[00:25:33.151 --> 00:25:34.151]  That's not true.
[00:25:34.792 --> 00:25:36.193]  You get 20 months in jail.
[00:25:38.126 --> 00:25:39.507]  Says that clown in a wig.
[00:25:40.188 --> 00:25:41.389]  I'm gonna play this for you.
[00:25:41.409 --> 00:25:52.600]  And then I got, literally, the statistics right here of 75-85% of the rapes in the UK, in France, in Germany, in Sweden, are the Muslims.
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.624]  Because they're literal cavemen lunatics.
[00:25:56.684 --> 00:25:57.685]  Not all the Muslims.
[00:25:58.165 --> 00:26:01.568]  Like you have Saudi Arabian ministers saying, Europe better stop bringing these people in.
[00:26:02.389 --> 00:26:03.369]  You're going to have a big problem.
[00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:04.690]  You've seen those clips, right?
[00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:11.833]  Like seven years ago, five years ago, top ministers in the Saudi Arabia are like, you're bringing in those folks from Central Asia.
[00:26:11.873 --> 00:26:12.513]  You're nuts.
[00:26:15.074 --> 00:26:19.315]  So even the hardcore Orthodox Muslims are like, you better watch out for these people.
[00:26:21.676 --> 00:26:22.557]  I mean, take Somalia.
[00:26:22.917 --> 00:26:24.517]  Crime is the culture.
[00:26:24.937 --> 00:26:28.699]  Robbery and being pirates and running slavery is the culture.
[00:26:30.179 --> 00:26:35.624]  They've been selling slaves out of Somalia for 2,500 years on record to the world.
[00:26:40.107 --> 00:26:40.728]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:26:41.228 --> 00:26:42.610]  Welsh Refugee Council.
[00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:43.450]  Go back and read that?
[00:26:44.131 --> 00:26:44.851]  I had never seen this.
[00:26:45.913 --> 00:26:48.695]  12-year-old girl meant to entice migrants to come to Wales.
[00:26:48.715 --> 00:26:50.237]  The Refugee Council was a far-left group.
[00:26:50.497 --> 00:26:51.438]  I'd never seen this.
[00:26:51.558 --> 00:26:52.859]  Okay, get me this.
[00:26:52.919 --> 00:26:53.499]  Print this off.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:54.500]  See?
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:55.181]  No, no.
[00:26:55.941 --> 00:26:56.702]  It's in Germany.
[00:26:56.922 --> 00:26:59.664]  And it shows this hot, blonde, famous singer.
[00:26:59.684 --> 00:27:00.245]  I forget her name.
[00:27:00.645 --> 00:27:04.268]  She's like, when you come to Germany, you get the women like me.
[00:27:04.668 --> 00:27:06.210]  You'll get to boom-boom me.
[00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:08.572]  And then they cut to the children's show.
[00:27:08.792 --> 00:27:11.294]  And it's like, this is whatever her name is.
[00:27:11.434 --> 00:27:13.315]  She's 12, and here's her boyfriend.
[00:27:14.176 --> 00:27:15.357]  His name's Habib.
[00:27:15.417 --> 00:27:15.937]  He's 22.
[00:27:16.578 --> 00:27:17.358]  They have sex.
[00:27:19.199 --> 00:27:20.180]  And I told the crew to find it.
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.801]  They found one out of England.
[00:27:23.402 --> 00:27:24.883]  Oh, hi, 12-year-old girl.
[00:27:25.324 --> 00:27:26.504]  You come from Pakistan.
[00:27:27.045 --> 00:27:28.065]  Be with me, please.
[00:27:29.086 --> 00:27:31.228]  God Almighty, what the hell?
[00:27:32.268 --> 00:27:33.249]  And then you talk about it.
[00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:35.210]  20 months in prison.
[00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:36.751]  I'm wearing a wig.
[00:27:36.811 --> 00:27:39.433]  All right, I'm going to come back and cover all the notice.
[00:27:39.453 --> 00:27:39.933]  Stay with us.
[00:27:40.714 --> 00:27:41.534]  Nitric Boost.
[00:27:42.492 --> 00:27:43.393]  Tumeric 95.
[00:27:45.214 --> 00:27:48.176]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[00:27:49.117 --> 00:27:54.100]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:28:01.765]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[00:28:02.326 --> 00:28:04.307]  They let us private label their products.
[00:28:04.327 --> 00:28:05.188]  That's why you've already heard of
[00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:07.091]  Body's Old Turmeric Formula?
[00:28:07.431 --> 00:28:10.173]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[00:28:10.433 --> 00:28:11.734]  This is just their brand of that.
[00:28:12.074 --> 00:28:15.376]  And so, it is available under Turmeric 95.
[00:28:15.776 --> 00:28:16.377]  That's the name.
[00:28:16.637 --> 00:28:23.101]  So, we're sold out of Body's, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated turmeric.
[00:28:23.341 --> 00:28:24.402]  Same thing with Nitric Boost.
[00:28:24.842 --> 00:28:26.463]  Nitric Boost came from this company.
[00:28:26.503 --> 00:28:28.505]  They even let us use their name.
[00:28:28.805 --> 00:28:29.806]  It's now our best seller.
[00:28:30.006 --> 00:28:31.006]  We sold out of our version.
[00:28:31.267 --> 00:28:32.728]  Their version has a white model.
[00:28:33.048 --> 00:28:34.429]  It's the exact same thing.
[00:28:34.969 --> 00:28:36.572]  You get it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:28:36.812 --> 00:28:39.396]  So check out InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:28:40.277 --> 00:28:41.479]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:41.539 --> 00:28:45.024]  So humanity is fighting for its very existence and survival.
[00:28:45.064 --> 00:28:45.785]  It's very sold.
[00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:52.574]  I just spent 30 minutes just basically talking about just in general my thoughts in the world.
[00:28:52.614 --> 00:28:55.036]  In fact, the corporate media has been dead for a long time.
[00:28:55.076 --> 00:28:55.817]  They know they're dead.
[00:28:56.337 --> 00:28:59.680]  All they can do is try to disrupt things like the Joker and sabotage things.
[00:29:00.421 --> 00:29:06.526]  And I know you all know that, but I just think we need to put that front and center and stop caring what the corporate media says.
[00:29:07.426 --> 00:29:08.587]  Stop caring what they do.
[00:29:09.688 --> 00:29:14.650]  And you realize that low-information voters are still somewhat caught off in that?
[00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.551]  Because they don't even really pay attention to the news.
[00:29:16.971 --> 00:29:18.451]  They just hear it second-hand.
[00:29:19.272 --> 00:29:21.312]  And we've got to think about how to reach those people.
[00:29:21.372 --> 00:29:22.233]  Can they be reached?
[00:29:23.033 --> 00:29:23.813]  That's the question.
[00:29:24.033 --> 00:29:35.498]  Kamala Harris has the tie-breaking vote to hire 86,000 IRS agents to harass blue-collar workers, service workers,
[00:29:36.874 --> 00:29:39.996]  That's their specialty, because they know a lot of them aren't paying taxes on tips.
[00:29:42.018 --> 00:29:44.880]  And then she comes out and says she wants to get rid of tax on tips.
[00:29:46.821 --> 00:29:54.287]  That's the type of thing you need to tell people that you know that are waitresses, or waiters, or maids, or masseuses, or car detailers.
[00:29:54.307 --> 00:29:58.110]  I mean, that's a big area of the economy, and that's how they make their money.
[00:29:59.349 --> 00:30:04.793]  I mean, I think the law in Texas is you get paid less than minimum wage as a waiter, but you get tips, but then they take a big piece of it.
[00:30:05.033 --> 00:30:06.554]  Look, I'm not going to keep going into that.
[00:30:06.614 --> 00:30:10.457]  The point is, is that these are really nasty, bad people, okay?
[00:30:10.477 --> 00:30:13.419]  They're going to have taxes on the rich people, great, okay?
[00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:17.221]  But in this federal reserve system, the taxes don't even go to run anything federally.
[00:30:18.582 --> 00:30:20.063]  And that's the big, dirty secret since 1913.
[00:30:20.864 --> 00:30:24.647]  It's all for social control to keep the people down.
[00:30:24.947 --> 00:30:27.729]  And these people are out to get you.
[00:30:29.575 --> 00:30:41.602]  And the general public that still thinks they're gonna get some free ride, they're making you poor so they can control you with that little domestication check you get, whereas you'd have five times the money if the system wasn't like this.
[00:30:43.363 --> 00:30:47.926]  But again, people fear, and they live in fear, and they live in those cultures where this happens.
[00:30:48.746 --> 00:30:57.271]  Whether it's poor black communities or Appalachia or, you know, so many other places, it all looks the same, it behaves the same, different skin color, but the same culture of dependency.
[00:30:58.689 --> 00:31:10.641]  So, you know, I was here live last night, millions tuned in, just on X, and tons of folks other places, and it really made me love Elon Musk and Donald Trump more.
[00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:12.002]  It was a really great discussion.
[00:31:12.983 --> 00:31:14.185]  For people that don't know audio,
[00:31:16.175 --> 00:31:19.397]  I don't have a degree in it, but I've been around it for 30 plus years, so I know all about it.
[00:31:20.097 --> 00:31:25.639]  And when you have a system like X, they're trying to fix it, it has the S's.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.822]  The S's become long, slisp, and the pops become popping.
[00:31:32.242 --> 00:31:35.324]  And you've got to have the right microphone and systems or you get that.
[00:31:35.664 --> 00:31:38.825]  And so because Trump had long S's,
[00:31:40.185 --> 00:31:41.706]  Which was just a form of reverb.
[00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:44.749]  Now it's all about he's slurring his words.
[00:31:44.829 --> 00:31:49.574]  No, after a long day, he did two hours and did a fabulous job.
[00:31:51.015 --> 00:31:52.476]  But there's your headline everywhere.
[00:31:52.616 --> 00:31:54.238]  Thousands of fake news headlines.
[00:31:54.638 --> 00:31:56.360]  Trump slurs through interview.
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.322]  Increasingly bizarre claims.
[00:31:58.802 --> 00:31:59.142]  Musk.
[00:31:59.583 --> 00:32:00.324]  Baga mania.
[00:32:02.686 --> 00:32:02.806]  Well,
[00:32:04.246 --> 00:32:08.369]  There aren't a billion people tuned in to all of the corporate media combined.
[00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:14.833]  You have to pay to put it in airports, pay to put it in hotels, pay to hang it on your hotel doorknob.
[00:32:14.853 --> 00:32:21.478]  You know, they... At gas station pumps, they got TVs blaring this crap at you.
[00:32:22.598 --> 00:32:23.699]  And it's just that.
[00:32:23.759 --> 00:32:24.299]  It's crap.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:32.385]  If somebody's trying to force you to take something or have something and making you do it, it must not be that good, right?
[00:32:34.428 --> 00:32:39.194]  I mean, if a restaurant was consistently just giving away free food, it must not be that good.
[00:32:40.416 --> 00:32:43.980]  Maybe when they first opened, give away a little entree or maybe an appetizer.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.083]  But if it's always free, what's going on in there?
[00:32:47.205 --> 00:32:48.606]  Must be money laundering or something.
[00:32:50.394 --> 00:32:56.118]  What I'm trying to get at here is I want to go through a bunch of these clips, I want to go through the news, and I need to because I did a lot of research for this.
[00:32:56.979 --> 00:32:58.260]  It's all completely insane.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:03.223]  NATO, as Jack Posobiec predicted six months ago, has launched into Russia.
[00:33:03.624 --> 00:33:07.746]  He said the new commanders they put in would start attacking into Russia, and that's happened.
[00:33:07.786 --> 00:33:15.192]  They've taken 400 square miles of Russia and just blown up churches and schools and just slaughtered civilians everywhere to piss off the Russians.
[00:33:16.482 --> 00:33:17.502]  To get a bigger response.
[00:33:18.283 --> 00:33:19.963]  Try to then draw in NATO officially.
[00:33:20.744 --> 00:33:21.624]  We've got that.
[00:33:22.544 --> 00:33:24.625]  We've got a lot of the stuff I mentioned we're going to get to.
[00:33:26.146 --> 00:33:28.767]  Where again, I've got the quote here.
[00:33:28.907 --> 00:33:30.428]  UK's free speech crackdown.
[00:33:30.448 --> 00:33:32.989]  20 months in prison for social media posts.
[00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:43.033]  The judge says, quote, you went on to say that you did not want your money going to immigrants who, quote, rape our kids and get priority, end quote.
[00:33:44.363 --> 00:33:48.545]  The offense is so serious that an immediate custodial sentence is unavoidable.
[00:33:49.505 --> 00:33:54.768]  The sentence that I pass has been reduced by one-third to reflect your guilty plea.
[00:33:55.468 --> 00:34:01.051]  The sentence is 20 months in prison.
[00:34:01.071 --> 00:34:04.733]  20 months in prison for saying the illegal aliens are raping people.
[00:34:05.793 --> 00:34:06.494]  Oh, headlines.
[00:34:06.954 --> 00:34:08.735]  France migration chaos.
[00:34:09.295 --> 00:34:11.816]  77% of rape cases on Paris streets committed by foreigners.
[00:34:12.536 --> 00:34:13.497]  Official government numbers.
[00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:16.327]  I got a whole stack of these.
[00:34:16.387 --> 00:34:17.168]  Sweden, England.
[00:34:17.668 --> 00:34:19.068]  So, for saying the truth.
[00:34:19.368 --> 00:34:22.989]  By the way, he has a right to say Martians are raping people.
[00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:29.251]  This guy under the Magna Carta and under the laws in the UK, that they completely ignore.
[00:34:29.271 --> 00:34:34.373]  And they say, we passed a law that it could motivate somebody to be angry or violent.
[00:34:34.813 --> 00:34:35.573]  That's hate speech.
[00:34:35.653 --> 00:34:37.074]  So it's a definition they create.
[00:34:37.294 --> 00:34:41.635]  So you got free speech under the law, except if we say it could hurt somebody.
[00:34:42.635 --> 00:34:44.896]  Oh, you can't tell anybody that
[00:34:45.942 --> 00:34:51.750]  These Muslim men are literally in surveys, 90% saying, I'm coming for the white women.
[00:34:52.671 --> 00:34:53.573]  I can show you the surveys.
[00:34:54.946 --> 00:34:57.867]  I don't care black or white, who are they, but they say we're coming for the white women.
[00:34:58.207 --> 00:35:03.509]  I could play you an hour of Imams saying, we go to Europe and we rape the white women.
[00:35:03.709 --> 00:35:16.973]  Hell, I saw at least 10 clips in the last week that I never even played because I'm so busy, where there's Imams driving along in the back of a truck in the UK with thousands of Muslims marching with machetes saying, we're going to rape your mothers, you pigs!
[00:35:17.213 --> 00:35:19.634]  We rape your children, your women are ours!
[00:35:20.996 --> 00:35:25.039]  Why do you think the Moors invaded Spain?
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:26.460]  Look up.
[00:35:26.941 --> 00:35:28.442]  Moor invasion of Spain.
[00:35:29.042 --> 00:35:31.564]  Took them hundreds of years to take over 80% of Spain.
[00:35:33.085 --> 00:35:42.433]  And then the North Africans came in to literally slave and sell Spanish women all over the Middle East.
[00:35:44.343 --> 00:35:46.224]  Because you get top dollar because, oh, that's different.
[00:35:47.325 --> 00:35:48.446]  We don't have any of those here.
[00:35:49.166 --> 00:35:55.090]  So you like, you know, go to the grocery store to get imported kiwis from New Zealand.
[00:35:56.631 --> 00:36:04.817]  Well, the Muslims were importing white women all over Africa and the Middle East.
[00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:10.580]  And that's the culture.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.761]  We're coming for your women, their arm.
[00:36:13.861 --> 00:36:15.662]  Give me the woman, my woman.
[00:36:16.022 --> 00:36:16.642]  Oh, yes.
[00:36:17.243 --> 00:36:19.063]  I'm coming to get your little girls.
[00:36:19.884 --> 00:36:25.366]  And per town, 2,000 plus girls raped down to age seven in sex slavery.
[00:36:25.666 --> 00:36:28.127]  And when you go complain to the police, they do nothing because they're in on it.
[00:36:30.043 --> 00:36:34.507]  The UK is a giant pedophile base with Jimmy Savelle and King Charles and all of them.
[00:36:34.607 --> 00:36:43.796]  And they bring in the Muslims because they feel from those Muslim countries, North Africa, Central Asia, where women are slaves, folks.
[00:36:48.083 --> 00:36:48.963]  Women are property.
[00:36:49.003 --> 00:36:50.284]  Women have hoods on their heads.
[00:36:50.364 --> 00:36:52.364]  Women, and the feminists love it.
[00:36:52.404 --> 00:36:58.726]  You go to these rallies, even in the U.S., and there's all these liberal women with their breasts out saying, we love Islam.
[00:36:59.106 --> 00:37:00.046]  We love Sharia law.
[00:37:00.066 --> 00:37:01.587]  It's like total mental illness.
[00:37:07.088 --> 00:37:12.209]  Yeah, the Spanish were known as the Visigoths.
[00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:13.810]  They were blonde-haired, blue-eyed.
[00:37:17.984 --> 00:37:18.965]  And they aren't anymore.
[00:37:21.347 --> 00:37:24.509]  But you see the nobility in Spain, they are.
[00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:32.555]  But that's just a few families that could run to the North and hide.
[00:37:34.357 --> 00:37:41.202]  And then they ran a Reconquista that took 400 to 500 years to drive the Muslims back into North Africa.
[00:37:47.603 --> 00:37:53.226]  So, if you want to get a nice historical snapshot of it, watch the Charlton Heston movie, El Cid.
[00:37:58.188 --> 00:38:04.612]  Captured Christian women were much prized throughout the Muslim world and their traffic was highly profitable.
[00:38:04.992 --> 00:38:08.514]  That's mainline Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:38:12.415 --> 00:38:12.756]  And so,
[00:38:14.212 --> 00:38:18.255]  These guys have the same customs, the same operations, the same plans.
[00:38:20.237 --> 00:38:24.901]  And if you say it in the UK, your ass gets locked up for 20 months in prison.
[00:38:25.081 --> 00:38:30.565]  But if you kill white kids with a machete, you get six months.
[00:38:32.827 --> 00:38:33.528]  Those are real cases.
[00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:40.894]  You hack a 10-year-old boy up with a machete because he's white, you get six months in jail.
[00:38:41.054 --> 00:38:42.015]  Job well done.
[00:38:47.623 --> 00:38:52.307]  Alright, I got a ton of no's, but I'm just so sick of all this crap, and I'm not bowing down to any of it.
[00:38:52.367 --> 00:38:52.867]  I'm done.
[00:38:53.808 --> 00:38:55.850]  And I want to just say something right now before I hit all the no's.
[00:39:00.633 --> 00:39:02.935]  You know, I am a dramatic person when things are dramatic.
[00:39:03.095 --> 00:39:04.737]  I'm only dramatic when something is dramatic.
[00:39:05.017 --> 00:39:06.938]  I act dramatic because I feel dramatic about it.
[00:39:07.479 --> 00:39:09.660]  But at a certain point, I'm just going to say this right now.
[00:39:13.624 --> 00:39:14.865]  We're reaching more people than ever.
[00:39:15.205 --> 00:39:16.346]  Thank you for spreading the word.
[00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.172]  But, we're under major attack.
[00:39:19.192 --> 00:39:20.893]  I'm not going to spend an hour explaining it to you.
[00:39:21.633 --> 00:39:23.275]  We've done nothing but deliver success.
[00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:35.598]  And I'm asking you humbly to keep us in the fight and to make the decision now, now, to go to drjonesnaturals.com and get great supplements, great nanosilver products, you name it.
[00:39:35.919 --> 00:39:48.289]  To go to infowarstore.com, where Vitamin Mineral Fusion's back in stock, and Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula's back in stock, and the amazing 1,000mg Organic Vitamin C with Rosehips and Zinc, the Linus Pauling Nobel Prize Formula.
[00:39:49.619 --> 00:39:51.179]  This is the standard classic.
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:52.580]  It's 40% off.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.260]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:55.681]  I need you to go there.
[00:39:55.701 --> 00:40:04.143]  I need you to get it and experience how great it is and sign up for AutoShip so they hold something back even if it sells out.
[00:40:04.443 --> 00:40:05.904]  At least on your first AutoShip you'll get it.
[00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:11.011]  The next time at 10% off and get a t-shirt, get a book, get a film.
[00:40:11.211 --> 00:40:12.851]  I need your support.
[00:40:12.991 --> 00:40:13.792]  We're in a war.
[00:40:14.432 --> 00:40:15.412]  I won't back down.
[00:40:15.592 --> 00:40:16.352]  I won't sell out.
[00:40:16.412 --> 00:40:17.172]  It's impossible.
[00:40:17.592 --> 00:40:18.493]  Is it in my DNA?
[00:40:18.713 --> 00:40:20.013]  Not even a discussion of it.
[00:40:23.774 --> 00:40:28.835]  But I could give out like a horse that didn't get given water or food and I'm not bitching.
[00:40:28.895 --> 00:40:30.495]  I'm saying I'm asking for aid.
[00:40:31.735 --> 00:40:33.516]  I want to thank those that have given us aid in this war.
[00:40:34.582 --> 00:40:35.943]  But I'm asking all of you that sit there.
[00:40:35.963 --> 00:40:41.868]  I mean, I had last night two and a half million conservatively new people on the show.
[00:40:42.708 --> 00:40:47.072]  And I got up this morning and checked the numbers and they're like, yeah, boss, we're not rich.
[00:40:47.212 --> 00:40:48.033]  It wasn't a good day.
[00:40:48.993 --> 00:40:49.214]  Wow.
[00:40:49.434 --> 00:40:49.814]  And I get it.
[00:40:49.834 --> 00:40:50.615]  The economy shot.
[00:40:52.305 --> 00:40:57.090]  Things are falling apart, but you need to decide to prioritize, I believe, to support this broadcast.
[00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:58.812]  The enemy sure thinks it's important.
[00:40:59.612 --> 00:41:06.019]  So go to m4warsstore.com, go to drjonesandaggles.com, and even if you don't want these products, I think you should take them.
[00:41:06.039 --> 00:41:06.579]  They're amazing.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.364]  Go get a t-shirt, get a book, get a film, get M4Wars MD line.
[00:41:12.782 --> 00:41:13.843]  Over 15 great products.
[00:41:13.883 --> 00:41:15.783]  The Prostate Support, the Ashwagandha.
[00:41:16.324 --> 00:41:20.286]  It's a, it doesn't, it doesn't, it's not like a sedative, but it relaxes you.
[00:41:21.106 --> 00:41:26.529]  So many great products with InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:41:27.049 --> 00:41:28.129]  Check out that whole line.
[00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:30.330]  The Good Night Sleeps, a great sleep aid.
[00:41:30.891 --> 00:41:32.331]  And again, these are all top formulas.
[00:41:32.351 --> 00:41:32.952]  They all vary.
[00:41:32.972 --> 00:41:33.952]  You're like, well, what's better?
[00:41:34.532 --> 00:41:37.334]  Good night's sleep from InfoWarsMD, or is it
[00:41:39.907 --> 00:41:41.768]  Rocket Rest at Dr. Jones Naturals.
[00:41:41.808 --> 00:41:42.808]  They're different formulas.
[00:41:42.828 --> 00:41:43.709]  They're different for different people.
[00:41:43.749 --> 00:41:44.889]  They're all strong as hell.
[00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:46.990]  They all work really well.
[00:41:48.731 --> 00:41:51.773]  So it varies person to person, but they're all top of the line.
[00:41:52.653 --> 00:41:54.254]  Libido RX works really good.
[00:41:54.474 --> 00:41:56.175]  Superfood Greens, amazing.
[00:41:56.975 --> 00:41:58.716]  Nitric Boost, boy, I'll tell you how great that is.
[00:42:00.497 --> 00:42:04.218]  All at InfoWarsTore.com or DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:42:04.258 --> 00:42:05.499]  And then we have a fundraiser.
[00:42:07.392 --> 00:42:11.349]  Our gold sponsor sells it at the lowest price at the highest quality for silver and gold you're gonna find.
[00:42:14.963 --> 00:42:22.951]  This offer is a memento and a fundraiser, and I'm not selling you this piece of art with gold embedded in it as an investment.
[00:42:22.991 --> 00:42:25.373]  I'm selling it as supporting the broadcast.
[00:42:25.393 --> 00:42:36.023]  I'm going to play this, and I'm going to discipline myself for the rest of the hour and the whole next hour, and I will cover everything on this plate except all the Trump clips.
[00:42:36.104 --> 00:42:37.605]  I'll play some, but we've got like 30 of them.
[00:42:37.865 --> 00:42:38.606]  The crew overdid it.
[00:42:38.626 --> 00:42:39.187]  They did a great job.
[00:42:39.824 --> 00:42:44.648]  But I've got 30 plus amazing clips from last night of Trump and Elon.
[00:42:44.928 --> 00:42:45.849]  I'll get to some of those.
[00:42:45.869 --> 00:42:49.372]  But everything else, I'm covering all of this that's on the plate.
[00:42:50.273 --> 00:42:52.555]  But bottom line, I don't want to spend my time up here.
[00:42:52.595 --> 00:42:56.198]  If some big patron, I always hear I have these secret rich people funding me all this crap.
[00:42:56.418 --> 00:42:57.599]  Boy, I'd like to see them show up.
[00:42:57.679 --> 00:43:00.502]  Somebody gave us all that Bitcoin money that kept us on air for two years.
[00:43:02.059 --> 00:43:03.181]  So just see it as a donation.
[00:43:03.241 --> 00:43:06.869]  Go to mfourastore.com, go to drjonesandankles.com and just take action.
[00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:10.817]  My God, I know everybody's got their hand out here, but we're going into battle.
[00:43:10.997 --> 00:43:11.939]  I'm like, give me ammo.
[00:43:12.039 --> 00:43:12.099]  I'm...
[00:43:14.534 --> 00:43:16.856]  And if this was a military operation, I'm not bragging, but it's true.
[00:43:17.016 --> 00:43:19.397]  We got so many damn medals, we can't even keep track of them all.
[00:43:19.998 --> 00:43:23.360]  So, bet on the winner, but at least bet on it.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.542]  Or, salute the new world order and stick your head between your legs.
[00:43:26.602 --> 00:43:28.984]  Because, I mean, I don't know what else we're supposed to do.
[00:43:29.304 --> 00:43:32.966]  It's like Gladiator, where he hacks up four dudes in 30 seconds, and he says, are you not entertained?
[00:43:33.006 --> 00:43:34.247]  I mean, what else am I supposed to do here?
[00:43:34.267 --> 00:43:39.951]  I mean... I'm not bitching, I'm just like, holy Toledo, man.
[00:43:39.991 --> 00:43:42.633]  Like... Alright.
[00:43:44.241 --> 00:43:50.028]  Here's a quick promo on the gold cards, and then we'll come back and hit all the news.
[00:43:50.048 --> 00:43:50.309]  Here it is.
[00:43:51.084 --> 00:43:58.489]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:01.411]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[00:44:02.012 --> 00:44:08.516]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.
[00:44:08.536 --> 00:44:12.419]  And that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[00:44:12.579 --> 00:44:18.744]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison.
[00:44:19.665 --> 00:44:28.251]  To double down and support the broadcast more than ever, to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at infowarestore.com.
[00:44:28.511 --> 00:44:37.617]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[00:44:37.997 --> 00:44:39.098]  These are very, very popular.
[00:44:39.158 --> 00:44:41.539]  And I went looking up online, it is very, very popular.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.881]  It's not an investment, it's a collectible.
[00:44:44.101 --> 00:44:47.043]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's
[00:44:47.563 --> 00:44:50.985]  Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:44:51.425 --> 00:44:55.427]  Best group out there, highest ratings, amazing prices, the best.
[00:44:55.687 --> 00:44:59.749]  This is a collectible at a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[00:45:00.289 --> 00:45:01.590]  Then the bankruptcy started.
[00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:08.033]  And the people that came in from the court said, we're not going to keep outside people's products in here, in your store.
[00:45:09.114 --> 00:45:09.934]  And they kicked him back
[00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:14.812]  To the folks, despite the fact we'd already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[00:45:15.113 --> 00:45:26.185]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[00:45:26.785 --> 00:45:35.149]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[00:45:35.669 --> 00:45:45.893]  Stock up on 24 karat .999 pure gold in the most popular size of one-tenth gram, an affordable sleek card that fits your wallet, drawer, glove compartment, and is easy to travel with.
[00:45:46.313 --> 00:45:47.794]  They're amazing cards.
[00:45:48.154 --> 00:45:49.995]  It's got original art I came up with.
[00:45:50.055 --> 00:45:52.416]  It's got the little bar of gold in there.
[00:45:52.956 --> 00:45:55.599]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Infowar.
[00:45:55.919 --> 00:46:01.945]  You'll have a historical memento as a keepsake for yourself, for your family, for your children, and your grandchildren.
[00:46:01.965 --> 00:46:03.606]  Because this is a historic fight.
[00:46:04.007 --> 00:46:07.830]  And this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:09.492]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[00:46:10.152 --> 00:46:13.034]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[00:46:13.615 --> 00:46:16.617]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[00:46:16.978 --> 00:46:21.821]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[00:46:22.202 --> 00:46:24.303]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[00:46:25.104 --> 00:46:31.069]  We've only got a few thousand of these left, and I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[00:46:31.089 --> 00:46:31.709]  Now, I want to be clear.
[00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:34.451]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[00:46:34.471 --> 00:46:35.252]  That's not what this is.
[00:46:35.272 --> 00:46:36.293]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[00:46:36.903 --> 00:46:39.464]  This is like on NPR that still gets taxpayer money.
[00:46:39.704 --> 00:46:50.006]  They'll sell a coffee mug to cost them five dollars or a baseball cap to cost them ten dollars and you make a hundred dollar donation and you get that as a memento that you supported communism in the new world order.
[00:46:50.286 --> 00:46:51.206]  I know you don't want to do that.
[00:46:51.926 --> 00:46:54.927]  This costs, I think they told me, more than ten dollars per card.
[00:46:55.747 --> 00:46:56.267]  Something like that.
[00:46:56.287 --> 00:46:57.088]  Ten or eleven dollars.
[00:46:57.628 --> 00:46:58.548]  And so the other
[00:46:59.343 --> 00:47:02.306]  80-something dollars will go to fund the operation.
[00:47:02.346 --> 00:47:05.489]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[00:47:06.009 --> 00:47:13.697]  So, get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[00:47:14.057 --> 00:47:15.158]  The decision is yours.
[00:47:15.178 --> 00:47:16.580]  This is a limited edition.
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:22.223]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[00:47:22.243 --> 00:47:32.509]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, that myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[00:47:32.909 --> 00:47:41.814]  So please take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars limited edition proprietary 24 karat 999 pure gold collectible.
[00:47:42.174 --> 00:47:43.055]  Thank you for your support.
[00:47:43.415 --> 00:47:45.056]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[00:47:51.538 --> 00:47:54.041]  And again, I don't want to sit up here all day and fundraise.
[00:47:54.201 --> 00:47:55.162]  I have to or we'll shut down.
[00:47:55.182 --> 00:47:55.743]  You want me to give up?
[00:47:57.365 --> 00:48:00.909]  Just please, more of you that are on the bench, go do it, and I'll shut up.
[00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:02.391]  These are great products, get them.
[00:48:02.491 --> 00:48:02.672]  Okay.
[00:48:03.988 --> 00:48:06.890]  I already talked a lot about Elon, and I'm going to get more into that next hour.
[00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:16.115]  But I also talked about, again, putting people in jail for 20 months for saying that there's a higher rate of rape by the Islamists.
[00:48:16.175 --> 00:48:16.695]  It's a fact.
[00:48:16.755 --> 00:48:19.417]  I'm actually going to go over the numbers coming up.
[00:48:19.777 --> 00:48:22.198]  It'll take like 10 minutes, but I'm going to do that next hour.
[00:48:23.059 --> 00:48:29.643]  The big developments in Russia, the big developments in Israel, just all sorts of bizarre stuff coming out about the coup against Biden.
[00:48:31.291 --> 00:48:34.073]  There is just so much here, but I wanted to hit this right now.
[00:48:35.253 --> 00:48:41.757]  Okay, so KJP, the White House Press Secretary, issues another whopper about Biden's view on taxing tips.
[00:48:41.877 --> 00:48:49.782]  And I know it's become an official sport, looking at the lives of these people, but this is just next level.
[00:48:51.943 --> 00:48:52.524]  She says that
[00:48:55.114 --> 00:48:58.895]  Biden has always, and Kamala's always supported not taxing tips.
[00:48:59.416 --> 00:49:08.019]  They literally hired 86,000 IRS agents, and she was the tie-breaking vote in the Senate, and when she was in the Senate, she supported similar crap.
[00:49:09.099 --> 00:49:11.460]  And so they literally target working-class people.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.201]  You cannot be bigger jerks.
[00:49:14.661 --> 00:49:18.263]  All the taxing of working people, low-level, does not fund anything, folks.
[00:49:18.963 --> 00:49:20.363]  I mean, it's a fraction of the taxes.
[00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:21.924]  But they want to hurt?
[00:49:23.513 --> 00:49:23.873]  We're good to go.
[00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:55.012]  And then they turn around, and I knew they would do this.
[00:49:55.813 --> 00:49:56.954]  I said this earlier in the week.
[00:49:57.935 --> 00:49:58.695]  I said it Sunday.
[00:49:58.936 --> 00:50:00.657]  Actually, no, I said last Friday.
[00:50:01.077 --> 00:50:02.018]  I said, you watch.
[00:50:02.619 --> 00:50:06.682]  They haven't just stolen the no tax on tips from Trump.
[00:50:06.722 --> 00:50:08.584]  They'll soon claim that it was their idea.
[00:50:09.485 --> 00:50:10.305]  Well, they're in power.
[00:50:10.405 --> 00:50:10.946]  Why did they do it?
[00:50:14.289 --> 00:50:15.610]  So, here she is.
[00:50:17.506 --> 00:50:25.889]  So following up on eliminating taxes on tips, is that an idea that the Biden administration considered at any point in the past three and a half years?
[00:50:26.029 --> 00:50:27.970]  What I can say is the president supports it.
[00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:39.294]  And what I can say is, obviously, the president and the vice president very much what I just how I answered the earlier question is that we have always put at front and center
[00:50:40.114 --> 00:50:45.197]  Making it easier, giving American families a little bit more breathing room, something the president says very often.
[00:50:45.857 --> 00:50:47.198]  And so, and we've shown that.
[00:50:47.358 --> 00:50:49.640]  We've shown that in the policies that we've laid out.
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:51:06.650]  And, you know, not going to go into what the former president said, but you know, if, if Republicans truly cared about that, truly cared about hardworking Americans, they would have joined us on a lot of these proposals that we put forward.
[00:51:07.878 --> 00:51:11.640]  Well, on a BS scale of 1 to 10, that's a bullshit 11.
[00:51:13.181 --> 00:51:14.822]  I mean, that is horse shit.
[00:51:17.583 --> 00:51:19.404]  Do people like being lied to like this?
[00:51:19.424 --> 00:51:23.967]  Does that make... The supporters of these people, do you like being chumped?
[00:51:25.067 --> 00:51:25.928]  I mean, I guess they do.
[00:51:25.988 --> 00:51:27.709]  It's that scenario with like pimps and hoes.
[00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:33.972]  And I guess some women, some men want to just be dominated and lied to and run over constantly.
[00:51:36.044 --> 00:51:37.726]  So I thought I'd show you some of the history.
[00:51:38.246 --> 00:51:41.830]  KJP issues a whopper about Biden's view on taxing tips.
[00:51:43.372 --> 00:51:49.118]  BP Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to let IRS track workers' tips without a warrant so they can be taxed.
[00:51:49.418 --> 00:51:50.620]  It's totally illegal, but they did it.
[00:51:51.561 --> 00:51:52.822]  Then I've got this clip I wanted to play.
[00:51:53.803 --> 00:51:55.265]  A reporter asked Gavin Newsom
[00:51:56.579 --> 00:51:58.460]  Why energy prices are up so high?
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:01.142]  And California has the highest energy prices in the country.
[00:52:01.903 --> 00:52:04.344]  They have basically doubled the last four years.
[00:52:05.085 --> 00:52:08.467]  And Gabenusim's answer is, prices are not high.
[00:52:09.227 --> 00:52:10.788]  You know, it's a minute 17 clip.
[00:52:10.808 --> 00:52:11.649]  I don't have time to get to it.
[00:52:11.669 --> 00:52:14.070]  I'll play it when we start the next hour.
[00:52:15.691 --> 00:52:16.292]  Oh my God.
[00:52:16.312 --> 00:52:18.613]  I'm going to be very disciplined next hour.
[00:52:18.733 --> 00:52:19.434]  I'm starting to do it.
[00:52:20.254 --> 00:52:21.115]  And I'm going to hit it all.
[00:52:21.315 --> 00:52:22.536]  Okay, or most of it.
[00:52:23.991 --> 00:52:26.272]  I could just do the whole show on Elon Musk and Trump.
[00:52:26.292 --> 00:52:27.993]  Maybe I should.
[00:52:28.073 --> 00:52:33.094]  No, I'm going to get all the military news and the economy news.
[00:52:34.295 --> 00:52:38.196]  And people say, oh, that's the UK where they're arresting people who are saying, hey, the Muslims are raping everybody.
[00:52:38.717 --> 00:52:39.577]  Ah, 20 months in jail.
[00:52:41.718 --> 00:52:44.879]  The ADL and George Soros have hope, not hate over there.
[00:52:45.399 --> 00:52:46.259]  That's their test.
[00:52:46.379 --> 00:52:52.842]  Everything you see in Australia and Germany and France and the UK and Canada is coming here.
[00:52:54.406 --> 00:52:57.309]  100%!
[00:52:55.547 --> 00:52:57.309]  So, hey, I already have empathy.
[00:52:57.349 --> 00:53:01.394]  I care about folks over there, but you also need to know, it's the enemy blueprint.
[00:53:02.595 --> 00:53:04.818]  You know, if the Martians blew up Moscow, would you care?
[00:53:04.858 --> 00:53:06.340]  Yeah, you would, because you know you're next.
[00:53:07.281 --> 00:53:08.522]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:53:08.542 --> 00:53:09.664]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now.
[00:53:09.724 --> 00:53:10.485]  Relox Jones on X.
[00:53:21.383 --> 00:53:29.429]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements.
[00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:34.172]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[00:53:34.633 --> 00:53:36.834]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[00:53:37.675 --> 00:53:43.079]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[00:53:44.136 --> 00:53:52.721]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[00:53:53.041 --> 00:53:54.903]  We had five companies making product for us.
[00:53:55.523 --> 00:54:00.046]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're in full wars.
[00:54:00.746 --> 00:54:06.410]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:09.331]  I'm not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[00:54:10.132 --> 00:54:11.653]  And they said, listen, you know
[00:54:12.864 --> 00:54:28.879]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it dropships out of our warehouses.
[00:54:29.259 --> 00:54:35.926]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:47.917]  Our products and a lot of the products that we developed, but so many of these products that they had put out again were the exact same thing that we were putting out.
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:57.002]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[00:54:57.083 --> 00:55:03.725]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[00:55:03.885 --> 00:55:06.365]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[00:55:06.545 --> 00:55:08.466]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[00:55:08.666 --> 00:55:18.432]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[00:55:19.073 --> 00:55:21.454]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[00:55:21.534 --> 00:55:22.575]  Take Turmeric 95.
[00:55:24.256 --> 00:55:30.959]  Turmeric 95 isn't called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[00:55:31.079 --> 00:55:36.741]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[00:55:36.841 --> 00:55:45.385]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[00:55:45.405 --> 00:55:47.566]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line, and
[00:55:49.113 --> 00:56:02.400]  Because of the bankruptcy, attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:07.282]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[00:56:07.343 --> 00:56:11.985]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[00:56:12.305 --> 00:56:15.727]  At InfoWarsStore.com from InfoWarsMD.
[00:56:15.887 --> 00:56:18.228]  So, I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[00:56:18.348 --> 00:56:18.949]  It's amazing.
[00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.989]  It's super high quality.
[00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:21.930]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:22.730]  Nitric Boost.
[00:56:22.871 --> 00:56:23.591]  Good night's sleep.
[00:56:23.831 --> 00:56:25.352]  Joint Relief Max is amazing.
[00:56:25.452 --> 00:56:26.733]  Nerve Renew Prostate Support.
[00:56:26.813 --> 00:56:27.813]  Probiotic Formula.
[00:56:27.953 --> 00:56:29.474]  CBD Full Spectrum.
[00:56:29.754 --> 00:56:30.855]  25 milligram gummies.
[00:56:30.975 --> 00:56:32.155]  CBD Full Spectrum.
[00:56:32.375 --> 00:56:33.176]  10 milligram gummies.
[00:56:33.196 --> 00:56:33.776]  Works great.
[00:56:33.816 --> 00:56:34.817]  Turmeric 95.
[00:56:34.957 --> 00:56:36.117]  Libido RX.
[00:56:36.277 --> 00:56:36.898]  Better Mood.
[00:56:37.058 --> 00:56:40.480]  Mushroom Max for mental clarity and your immune system.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:41.340]  Superfood Green
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:41.780]  Thank you.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:16.963]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to blitzkrieg the news in the shower.
[00:57:17.544 --> 00:57:18.444]  So buckle up.
[00:57:18.604 --> 00:57:22.827]  And then we have a very well-decorated, well-respected
[00:57:23.943 --> 00:57:31.789]  Navy officer that comes highly recommended by the Trump campaign to have on the show with a deep dive on who the key people are in the deep state.
[00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:36.292]  You've seen Ivan Reikland kind of target this group, but this is a big dossier.
[00:57:36.312 --> 00:57:40.535]  We're talking 400 pages total that I've read on this the last week.
[00:57:41.236 --> 00:57:45.058]  So a special guest coming up in 60 minutes next hour on that.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:48.321]  But getting back to what I was talking about.
[00:57:49.909 --> 00:57:53.652]  This tip thing is a real chink in the armor of the bad guys.
[00:57:54.392 --> 00:58:05.600]  Because, again, Biden massively increased the IRS, burp there, to go after people that are service workers.
[00:58:06.181 --> 00:58:08.242]  It's a total jerk move, dick move.
[00:58:08.522 --> 00:58:09.683]  It's just, it's so horrible.
[00:58:09.743 --> 00:58:15.287]  It's so... I have a big vocabulary, but sometimes I've got to cuss sometimes because the only words to describe it.
[00:58:16.548 --> 00:58:18.430]  It's chicken shit.
[00:58:19.434 --> 00:58:21.716]  To target hard-working, working-class people.
[00:58:22.116 --> 00:58:28.321]  It pisses me off that the Democrats constantly claim that they're the guardians of the little guys.
[00:58:28.341 --> 00:58:34.386]  Yeah, I mean, and look at this training video a few years ago, the slobs.
[00:58:34.566 --> 00:58:39.109]  I mean, look at the slobs they're hiring to raid people's houses over like $2,000, $3,000, $4,000.
[00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:44.353]  Because without a warrant, they're tracking everything you deposit, everything you do.
[00:58:44.413 --> 00:58:45.034]  It's all admitted.
[00:58:45.334 --> 00:58:46.015]  Totally illegal.
[00:58:46.815 --> 00:58:47.556]  But they just do it.
[00:58:50.407 --> 00:59:03.819]  And Kamala Harris is the main author of it, and then she sits there, it's like having a drowning person and showing them the floaty, you know, the flotation device, saying, oh, you want this?
[00:59:03.899 --> 00:59:05.740]  Here, I'm gonna give this to you.
[00:59:07.182 --> 00:59:07.702]  But they don't.
[00:59:10.925 --> 00:59:15.208]  So this is the clown show, folks, that we're dealing with.
[00:59:15.228 --> 00:59:17.851]  But Gavin Newsom knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:59:20.495 --> 00:59:25.397]  And all Gavin Newsom's gotta do to be popular is to be like Elon Musk or Joe Rogan.
[00:59:25.757 --> 00:59:26.978]  And I'm not gonna tell you who.
[00:59:27.658 --> 00:59:35.121]  But one time, recently, I was at a Saturday evening steak dinner with a very well-known person.
[00:59:36.322 --> 00:59:43.545]  And Gavin Newsom was texting these people saying, please stop attacking me, please stop saying bad things about me, please have me on your show.
[00:59:43.565 --> 00:59:45.686]  And I was being shown the text.
[00:59:47.017 --> 00:59:51.578]  And the well-known talk show host sent him a text back saying, well, stop being a jerk.
[00:59:53.638 --> 00:59:54.318]  Like, Gavin!
[00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:57.279]  You want to be popular?
[00:59:57.359 --> 00:59:58.519]  Stop worshipping!
[00:59:58.539 --> 01:00:00.740]  But I know you're Nancy Pelosi's nephew or whatever.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.680]  I mean, you know, so you can't stop.
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:04.400]  It's who you are.
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.541]  We get it, buddy boy.
[01:00:06.941 --> 01:00:11.182]  But... He's totally unselfaware.
[01:00:11.302 --> 01:00:12.862]  This is Patrick Bateman for real.
[01:00:13.894 --> 01:00:18.900]  So here he is, when a reporter goes, hey, energy prices are off the hook, especially in California.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.543]  Solar panels are also supposed to make it all cheap.
[01:00:21.583 --> 01:00:23.665]  And he's like, no, things aren't expensive.
[01:00:24.706 --> 01:00:27.609]  Marie Antoinette may not have said, let them eat cake, but he just did.
[01:00:27.629 --> 01:00:28.731]  Here it is.
[01:00:28.831 --> 01:00:34.317]  As far as on the energy topic, I live in Woodland and I'm actually a customer of Valley Clean Energy.
[01:00:35.071 --> 01:00:37.493]  And I can tell you my power bills have not gone down.
[01:00:38.394 --> 01:00:45.079]  And I'm curious, when should California see some financial benefit to this transformation to renewables?
[01:00:45.439 --> 01:00:46.240]  Well, I think we have.
[01:00:47.741 --> 01:00:53.265]  That wind, the water, and solar has kept prices down.
[01:00:53.445 --> 01:00:55.286]  This is the cheapest form of energy right out here.
[01:00:57.068 --> 01:01:00.130]  It's had a significant impact on what you don't see.
[01:01:01.531 --> 01:01:03.212]  Our nation-leading climate policies
[01:01:04.053 --> 01:01:04.673]  We're good to go.
[01:01:24.423 --> 01:01:24.723]  There you go!
[01:01:45.433 --> 01:01:47.394]  If you're a radio listener, you can't see this.
[01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:48.915]  It's really entertaining.
[01:01:49.175 --> 01:01:52.557]  Go to RealAlexJones on X. We're going to post it on the front page of Infowars.
[01:01:52.597 --> 01:02:02.182]  But it's that Indiana Jones scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark when he first goes into that temple and tries to replace the golden idol with the sand.
[01:02:02.763 --> 01:02:07.805]  Well, instead, it's Pelosi trying to replace Joe Biden with Kamala Harris.
[01:02:07.845 --> 01:02:09.026]  And then, of course, it backfires.
[01:02:09.066 --> 01:02:09.446]  Here it is.
[01:02:11.147 --> 01:02:12.268]  Come on.
[01:02:15.097 --> 01:02:19.240]  So, my concern was this ain't happening.
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:20.520]  Come on.
[01:02:21.081 --> 01:02:27.124]  And we have to make a decision for this to happen.
[01:02:27.184 --> 01:02:28.065]  Come on.
[01:02:28.305 --> 01:02:34.209]  And the president has to make the decision for that to happen.
[01:02:34.409 --> 01:02:36.110]  Come on, folks.
[01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:40.713]  Let me just say, I won't say necessarily I knew what I was doing at that time.
[01:02:41.273 --> 01:02:42.293]  I knew what I was doing.
[01:02:43.474 --> 01:02:44.014]  Come on.
[01:02:48.524 --> 01:02:49.084]  Come on!
[01:02:49.324 --> 01:02:50.205]  This is solid gold, folks.
[01:02:50.285 --> 01:02:54.507]  I can imagine what can be and be unburdened by what has been.
[01:02:54.747 --> 01:02:55.327]  You know?
[01:02:55.347 --> 01:02:59.769]  Come on!
[01:02:59.889 --> 01:03:01.550]  Great job, Chase Geyser, putting this together.
[01:03:20.188 --> 01:03:25.332]  Breaking leaked video of moment Pelosi forced Biden out of presidential race.
[01:03:32.999 --> 01:03:34.840]  I'll get you and your little dog too!
[01:03:36.902 --> 01:03:37.422]  Fly!
[01:03:37.502 --> 01:03:37.883]  Fly!
[01:03:37.943 --> 01:03:38.563]  Bring them to me!
[01:03:41.746 --> 01:03:44.968]  Can we see the Wicked Witch cackling from
[01:03:47.264 --> 01:03:50.886]  Wizard of Oz and compare it to her because she sounds even more distasteful.
[01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:54.848]  I mean, you can't, you can't fake evil like that.
[01:03:54.968 --> 01:03:58.710]  I mean, I'm pretty good at faking stuff, you know, having fun here.
[01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:59.851]  I can't, I can't do it.
[01:04:00.311 --> 01:04:04.573]  I can't pull off a Kamala Harris cackle because you can't fake that.
[01:04:04.593 --> 01:04:09.336]  I mean, she is a nasty hombre, as they say.
[01:04:09.356 --> 01:04:13.218]  All right, let's start drilling into the news here.
[01:04:14.599 --> 01:04:16.260]  Look at this insane
[01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:18.622]  Level of spin.
[01:04:20.944 --> 01:04:23.505]  And we're going to play this paintball clip in a minute.
[01:04:23.906 --> 01:04:24.967]  I believe that's on the list, right?
[01:04:26.288 --> 01:04:27.288]  Because people forget about this.
[01:04:30.571 --> 01:04:31.191]  So many clips.
[01:04:31.211 --> 01:04:32.612]  The crew does a great job.
[01:04:32.712 --> 01:04:33.993]  I like sending like 100 clips a day.
[01:04:34.554 --> 01:04:36.235]  Sometimes they miss the mark.
[01:04:36.275 --> 01:04:37.256]  Did I send you the clip?
[01:04:37.276 --> 01:04:38.817]  Do we have the... Oh, we have it.
[01:04:39.317 --> 01:04:39.857]  We have it, okay.
[01:04:40.778 --> 01:04:44.441]  So, we forget about this, but this is a big deal.
[01:04:47.278 --> 01:04:49.979]  Donald Trump at risk of losing Florida, poll shows.
[01:04:50.899 --> 01:04:51.979]  Now, that's Newsweek.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:05:03.983]  So, everybody needs to understand that they're just trying to convince you that when they try to steal the election, if they're successful, that Trump lost.
[01:05:04.263 --> 01:05:05.183]  That's what this is all about.
[01:05:07.464 --> 01:05:09.185]  But now they've got their new fake polls out.
[01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:10.885]  Oh, Trump could lose Florida.
[01:05:11.185 --> 01:05:13.446]  Does anyone actually believe that?
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:31.276]  That dovetails with Tim Walz, who supports letting pedophiles out of jail, decriminalizing sex with children, wants to cut your children's genitals off, stood down for four days while Minnesota burned, says he supports socialism,
[01:05:34.867 --> 01:05:39.430]  Stolen Valor, even more videos have come out now of him actually saying he was in combat.
[01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:41.171]  I mean, he's caught dead to rights.
[01:05:41.891 --> 01:05:47.154]  It kind of sucks, though, because all the other stuff came out that was bad, but then the really horrible stuff came out.
[01:05:47.434 --> 01:05:48.515]  It's like, oh, we already heard that.
[01:05:49.876 --> 01:05:50.656]  It's just incredible.
[01:05:51.837 --> 01:05:53.158]  So I'd forgotten about this.
[01:05:53.258 --> 01:05:58.681]  I was on X this morning and somebody retweeted at me saying, hey, Alex, don't forget about this.
[01:05:58.741 --> 01:05:59.361]  Well, thank you.
[01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:01.522]  That's why I read the news feeds.
[01:06:01.602 --> 01:06:02.243]  I'd forgotten.
[01:06:04.221 --> 01:06:05.243]  In 2020 during the lockdowns and 2021.
[01:06:09.315 --> 01:06:12.077]  While the left, remember the studies, the fake studies?
[01:06:12.357 --> 01:06:17.921]  Oh, scientists say Black Lives Matter protests are good for COVID.
[01:06:18.742 --> 01:06:22.544]  So all those crowds out together are good for COVID when they're burning things down.
[01:06:23.505 --> 01:06:26.988]  But when you're on your front porch in Minneapolis or St.
[01:06:27.068 --> 01:06:38.596]  Paul, the governor, who gave the authorization, it's in the news, I'll show you the article, he sent out the police with paintball guns, which hurt like hell at 30 feet away,
[01:06:40.578 --> 01:06:44.559]  To shoot people, which is a simulation for martial law.
[01:06:46.039 --> 01:06:58.522]  Kamala's VP, Tim Walz, sent his tyrannical agents into many Minnesota neighborhoods, they sent the State Guard, National Guard in, to shoot citizens with paintball guns during COVID.
[01:06:58.882 --> 01:07:08.864]  So Humvees, with the police, come into your town, you're on your front porch drinking a Coors Light, and they shoot you with paintballs,
[01:07:12.062 --> 01:07:18.405]  While at the same time, $2 billion of stuff was burned down in Minnesota alone.
[01:07:23.632 --> 01:07:29.475]  Kamala VP Tim Walz sent his tyrannical agents into Minnesota neighborhoods to shoot citizens with paintball guns during COVID.
[01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:31.836]  Do we really want someone like this in our country?
[01:07:32.156 --> 01:07:32.976]  That's the Hodge twins.
[01:07:33.456 --> 01:07:34.997]  Now, here's the actual articles.
[01:07:35.457 --> 01:07:35.938]  USA Today.
[01:07:36.378 --> 01:07:39.519]  Minneapolis cops shoot paint at people on porch.
[01:07:39.979 --> 01:07:40.760]  No, it was in the news.
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:44.061]  They ran around just shooting hundreds of people and beating people up.
[01:07:44.701 --> 01:07:45.242]  Light them up!
[01:07:45.342 --> 01:07:49.143]  Police shoot paintballs at Minneapolis residents standing on their porch.
[01:07:49.524 --> 01:07:50.144]  London Independent.
[01:07:52.364 --> 01:07:56.329]  I came to Minneapolis protest to cover police aggression, then I became a victim of it.
[01:07:56.729 --> 01:07:56.850]  Oh.
[01:07:59.593 --> 01:08:04.719]  So, mostly peaceful, burning everything down, something walls supported.
[01:08:06.942 --> 01:08:10.106]  But then if you're on your front porch drinking a beer, because they were interviewing the news,
[01:08:11.834 --> 01:08:13.455]  Well, we're gonna drive up and shoot you.
[01:08:14.175 --> 01:08:21.918]  So the police, with the military, insimulated murder of citizens, running around harassing people, to stay in their houses and be brainwashed.
[01:08:21.938 --> 01:08:23.479]  Of course, it backfired.
[01:08:23.519 --> 01:08:24.879]  Everybody just tuned into this show and others.
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:26.980]  What does Elon say woke him up?
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.181]  The COVID lockdowns and then coming after his son's genitals.
[01:08:30.622 --> 01:08:31.782]  Successfully, unfortunately.
[01:08:33.083 --> 01:08:33.683]  I'm making light of it.
[01:08:33.703 --> 01:08:34.143]  It's serious.
[01:08:34.163 --> 01:08:34.663]  It's a nightmare.
[01:08:35.884 --> 01:08:38.585]  I couldn't even imagine that my son had been grabbed by these people.
[01:08:40.014 --> 01:08:42.735]  My son's a manly man, a bull, way better than I am.
[01:08:44.956 --> 01:08:47.458]  Not unsuccessful with the ladies, proud of him.
[01:08:48.278 --> 01:08:53.180]  But the point is, I couldn't imagine if my son wore a wig and had his dick cut off.
[01:08:54.381 --> 01:09:00.163]  But I'd be more pissed off and see if they did that, so... Thank God Rex Jones is not dead like Elon's son.
[01:09:01.124 --> 01:09:03.805]  But hey, you pissed Elon off, so he'll have 10 more kids.
[01:09:05.186 --> 01:09:05.346]  But...
[01:09:08.066 --> 01:09:09.627]  By the way, I've decided to have more children.
[01:09:09.647 --> 01:09:10.447]  I think I'm going to do that.
[01:09:10.467 --> 01:09:13.189]  I'm going to double down during these crises.
[01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:13.910]  I'm not going to give up.
[01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:16.091]  I've had the discussions.
[01:09:16.111 --> 01:09:16.971]  Should we have more children?
[01:09:16.991 --> 01:09:18.372]  The world's so bad.
[01:09:18.392 --> 01:09:20.353]  I'm kind of getting where I'm like, maybe not.
[01:09:20.413 --> 01:09:20.854]  You know what?
[01:09:20.894 --> 01:09:21.674]  I'm doubling down.
[01:09:21.694 --> 01:09:26.037]  Because that's what God wants to see.
[01:09:26.057 --> 01:09:28.859]  He wants to see will, and he wants to see us believing in the future.
[01:09:29.299 --> 01:09:29.839]  And I'm going to do it.
[01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:32.841]  If that is the Lord's plan.
[01:09:39.912 --> 01:09:40.492]  Here's the clip.
[01:09:40.772 --> 01:09:43.813]  There's many of these, but here they are attacking people on their front porches.
[01:09:43.853 --> 01:09:44.713]  The militarized police.
[01:09:44.733 --> 01:09:50.055]  Look at this.
[01:09:50.455 --> 01:09:58.497]  Man, if I was on my front porch and police with the National Guard showed up and shot me with paintball... What a bunch of dicks.
[01:09:59.558 --> 01:10:00.138]  Get inside!
[01:10:00.198 --> 01:10:01.378]  Get in your house now!
[01:10:01.418 --> 01:10:01.898]  Let's go!
[01:10:02.018 --> 01:10:04.519]  Light him up!
[01:10:05.979 --> 01:10:07.040]  Go inside now!
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:08.000]  Get in the house!
[01:10:12.466 --> 01:10:13.127]  You know, in general... Get in!
[01:10:13.147 --> 01:10:13.307]  Get in!
[01:10:13.327 --> 01:10:13.547]  Get in!
[01:10:13.568 --> 01:10:13.688]  Get in!
[01:10:13.708 --> 01:10:13.868]  Get in!
[01:10:13.888 --> 01:10:14.048]  Get in!
[01:10:14.068 --> 01:10:14.188]  Get in!
[01:10:14.208 --> 01:10:14.329]  Get in!
[01:10:14.349 --> 01:10:14.469]  Get in!
[01:10:14.489 --> 01:10:14.609]  Get in!
[01:10:14.629 --> 01:10:14.829]  Get in!

[01:10:28.768 --> 01:10:28.949]  Get in!
[01:10:28.969 --> 01:10:29.289]  Get in
[01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:30.170]  Okay.
[01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:34.451]  So in general, I don't demonize police just to demonize it like it's cool.
[01:10:34.891 --> 01:10:37.432]  But the police can be under the control of the bad guys.
[01:10:37.752 --> 01:10:39.512]  Like were the police bad in Soviet Russia?
[01:10:40.132 --> 01:10:41.332]  Are they bad in China today?
[01:10:41.432 --> 01:10:42.473]  You're like, oh yeah, of course they are.
[01:10:43.553 --> 01:10:45.093]  So everybody lionizes the police.
[01:10:45.113 --> 01:10:46.193]  They're just like regular people.
[01:10:46.233 --> 01:10:47.233]  They can be good, they can be bad.
[01:10:48.314 --> 01:10:49.894]  So go off what they actually do.
[01:10:49.994 --> 01:10:54.415]  But in leftist controlled areas like California, in many areas like
[01:10:55.718 --> 01:10:57.940]  Minnesota, they're not good folks.
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:03.204]  Just like the UK, they will put your ass under the prison for saying Muslims are raping people.
[01:11:03.565 --> 01:11:06.888]  And I mentioned this earlier, but now let's get into it.
[01:11:06.908 --> 01:11:10.371]  Then I'll get into the Elon Musk epic billion plus viewers last night, some of the best clips.
[01:11:10.391 --> 01:11:18.678]  Now you have to understand, this is a quick two minute search of Europe and the UK
[01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:29.155]  And I didn't even get, for some reason, maybe it's in the printer, but the Muslim Asian rape gangs, 2,000 children, even in small towns, little girls being raped.
[01:11:31.276 --> 01:11:35.458]  So we'll put some of those on screen too, because, you know, the problem is you can't even do justice to this.
[01:11:36.639 --> 01:11:41.601]  It sounds like overkill, and I'm about to show you like 20 articles, but that's like a drop in the bucket here, okay?
[01:11:42.122 --> 01:11:44.463]  So between 75% and 85% of all rape in Europe and the UK
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:51.203]  And now in major leftist cities in Canada that's brought in millions of illegals.
[01:11:51.223 --> 01:11:57.908]  Remember, there's only like 30-something million Canadians, so now it's like a third of them are illegal aliens now, basically.
[01:11:58.908 --> 01:12:11.557]  So, imagine you go on social media during the Islamists stabbing three kids, killing them, burning things down, murdering people, just running around screaming at people.
[01:12:12.818 --> 01:12:14.940]  I've been in the UK in years, but I've been there many times.
[01:12:15.891 --> 01:12:27.303]  And multiple times I would be shooting video of Trafalgar Square or of a statue and I would notice Muslims in their outfits would say, hey you effer, don't you videotape me?
[01:12:27.323 --> 01:12:30.647]  And I'm like, excuse me?
[01:12:30.687 --> 01:12:31.908]  And the guy would get in my face.
[01:12:32.168 --> 01:12:33.009]  I got this video somewhere.
[01:12:33.029 --> 01:12:33.590]  I never put it out.
[01:12:34.411 --> 01:12:37.254]  And I'm like, I'm like, eff you back.
[01:12:37.294 --> 01:12:38.475]  I'm like, I'm just videotaping here.
[01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:46.374]  But the average Brit has been taught to be so calm and nice, even though Brits are tough, you know, they fight pretty hard.
[01:12:48.816 --> 01:12:49.516]  They just grovel.
[01:12:49.536 --> 01:12:50.477]  That'd be like, screw you!
[01:12:50.497 --> 01:12:53.500]  And they would immediately back down because there wasn't a gang of them.
[01:12:55.281 --> 01:12:58.484]  But they run around hen-pecking and dominating British.
[01:12:59.185 --> 01:13:00.886]  It's not going too well for them in Ireland.
[01:13:02.388 --> 01:13:05.971]  The Irish had not been given the imperial programming the British have.
[01:13:08.473 --> 01:13:11.874]  They're nice folks until you mess with them a little bit, just like the Scots.
[01:13:12.315 --> 01:13:16.096]  And I'm not putting the English down, hell, I'm Welsh, you know, part of my bloodline.
[01:13:16.696 --> 01:13:21.038]  But the Brits were so wild, they'd been brainwashed for hundreds if not 500 years.
[01:13:21.678 --> 01:13:22.939]  You stuck your head up, you got killed.
[01:13:24.059 --> 01:13:28.581]  So they've kind of been tamed a bit, and which is sad, until they're not tamed.
[01:13:29.491 --> 01:13:41.827]  And that's why the globalists know that if they don't keep the Brits in line and sit on them properly and absolutely dominate them while they do their Islamic takeover, which is totally compatible with the pedophile British elites.
[01:13:43.353 --> 01:13:44.954]  They're gonna lose and lose big time.
[01:13:45.674 --> 01:13:48.135]  So, here's one of the top judges in the UK.
[01:13:49.016 --> 01:13:52.858]  UK's free speech crackdown, 20 months in prison for social media posts.
[01:13:52.898 --> 01:13:53.578]  Here's the judge.
[01:13:54.098 --> 01:14:02.182]  You went on to say that you did not want your money going to immigrants who quote, rape kids and get priority, end quote.
[01:14:02.682 --> 01:14:03.623]  Which is all totally true.
[01:14:04.263 --> 01:14:09.806]  The offense is so serious, telling the truth, that an immediate custodial sentence is unavoidable.
[01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:14.590]  The sentence that I pass has been reduced by one-third to reflect your guilty plea.
[01:14:15.531 --> 01:14:16.892]  The sentence is 20 months in prison.
[01:14:19.815 --> 01:14:20.877]  Let's play that clip, Herodas.
[01:14:21.710 --> 01:14:31.620]  Went on to say that you did not want your money going to immigrants who, quote, rape our kids and get priority, end quote.
[01:14:32.161 --> 01:14:39.088]  This offence is so serious that an immediate custodial sentence is unavoidable.
[01:14:39.729 --> 01:14:40.610]  Would you stand please?
[01:14:43.188 --> 01:14:48.229]  The sentence that I pass has been reduced by one third to reflect your guilty plea.
[01:14:48.949 --> 01:14:51.630]  The sentence is one of 20 months' imprisonment.
[01:14:53.451 --> 01:14:58.172]  Can I do it?
[01:14:58.192 --> 01:14:58.772]  Come on, I'll laugh.
[01:14:58.812 --> 01:14:59.392]  I can't even do it.
[01:15:00.592 --> 01:15:02.353]  France migration chaos.
[01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:07.434]  77% of rape cases in Paris streets committed by foreigners in 2023.
[01:15:07.974 --> 01:15:09.135]  Shock stats revealed.
[01:15:09.155 --> 01:15:10.775]  Remember, the numbers are always a year behind.
[01:15:13.027 --> 01:15:19.774]  Of the 97,000 reported rapes, almost all were foreigners.
[01:15:21.335 --> 01:15:21.836]  Sweden.
[01:15:22.296 --> 01:15:22.576]  Rape.
[01:15:22.777 --> 01:15:25.980]  Most convicted attackers, foreign born.
[01:15:27.401 --> 01:15:28.002]  70 plus percent.
[01:15:29.801 --> 01:15:32.142]  Rape is almost an inevitable part of migration.
[01:15:32.222 --> 01:15:33.283]  Eight women tell their story.
[01:15:33.603 --> 01:15:48.152]  Yeah, even Amnesty International reported like 15 years ago, 12 years ago, that 80% of girls and women coming across the US-Mexico border, not by Don Johnson, like, you know, machete kills,
[01:15:49.642 --> 01:15:57.031]  White guys are raping and murdering Mexicans and we're just like running around raping Mexicans and shooting them and Don Johnson's shooting pregnant Mexican women.
[01:15:57.391 --> 01:15:59.854]  If a white dude was doing that, I'd say execute his ass.
[01:16:00.655 --> 01:16:05.421]  But come on folks, are the gringos really raping the Mexican women and shooting them with 243s?
[01:16:07.043 --> 01:16:09.526]  Any American, whether they're brown or white, knows
[01:16:11.258 --> 01:16:15.800]  When you pull up at a gas station at midnight, you see a cowboy pumping gas, a white guy, are you really scared?
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:16.000]  No.
[01:16:16.441 --> 01:16:19.022]  Everybody knows we ain't raping the Mexicans.
[01:16:19.522 --> 01:16:21.343]  God, I'm sick of this crap!
[01:16:22.643 --> 01:16:25.565]  But, on their way here, 80% are getting raped.
[01:16:25.585 --> 01:16:31.748]  Just type in, Ambassy International, 80% of women raped traveling to the United States through Mexico.
[01:16:32.981 --> 01:16:44.591]  And I'm not attacking the Mexicans, but it's a thing, and the minority of Mexicans do it, but it's a thing where they rape the women, and I mean, I just, I'm not gonna take the blame, I'm not gonna do it, I'm not gonna sit here and, I didn't do it!
[01:16:45.952 --> 01:16:51.377]  I wasn't raised to rape people, and I'm not saying Mexicans do that either, but the coyotes and the criminals down there do it.
[01:16:52.478 --> 01:16:54.340]  And the Mexicans are pissed off, fighting back against it.
[01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:55.701]  They don't want their daughters raped.
[01:16:56.742 --> 01:16:57.242]  But look at this.
[01:16:58.123 --> 01:17:00.025]  The influx of immigrants into Europe
[01:17:03.789 --> 01:17:05.611]  And the increase in sexual violence.
[01:17:07.933 --> 01:17:11.517]  When Europe ignored the sex crimes of immigrants, all women suffered.
[01:17:11.557 --> 01:17:12.237]  New York Post.
[01:17:13.599 --> 01:17:13.999]  Sweden.
[01:17:14.039 --> 01:17:18.323]  Researchers face prosecution for a study that showed most rapes are committed by immigrants.
[01:17:18.644 --> 01:17:18.864]  See?
[01:17:19.164 --> 01:17:20.125]  You just saw England.
[01:17:20.625 --> 01:17:23.749]  The judge say, 20 months in jail, you said Muslims rape people.
[01:17:23.769 --> 01:17:27.993]  And they're threatening to arrest US citizens, including Elon Musk.
[01:17:29.335 --> 01:17:33.399]  Sweden researchers faced prosecutors for a study that showed most rapes are committed by immigrants.
[01:17:33.959 --> 01:17:34.900]  And guess what the number is?
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:35.921]  Over 70%.
[01:17:36.721 --> 01:17:43.287]  Afghan migrant raped young man for hours on the platform in front of police.
[01:17:44.508 --> 01:17:46.830]  Norway teaches migrants about Western women.
[01:17:49.813 --> 01:17:52.035]  Germany migrant rape crisis worsens.
[01:17:53.314 --> 01:17:54.415]  Upwards of 80% are rapes.
[01:17:54.995 --> 01:18:00.699]  Exclusive, women and children risk rape and sexual violence at all stages of EU migration.
[01:18:03.481 --> 01:18:07.303]  Rape convictions rate 75% in Sweden.
[01:18:10.905 --> 01:18:13.667]  Migrants and crime in Sweden is the 21st century.
[01:18:13.987 --> 01:18:15.769]  Got a lot of stories from Sweden for some reason.
[01:18:16.169 --> 01:18:17.630]  But I can show you these for France.
[01:18:20.151 --> 01:18:30.700]  Young AFP politician convicted after publishing gang rape statistics in connection with Afghan migration, showing they commit the majority of rapes, just the Afghans commit the majority.
[01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:32.442]  Well, jail time.
[01:18:34.127 --> 01:18:36.028]  See, you notice Germany, England, same thing.
[01:18:36.489 --> 01:18:45.635]  ADL, Soros, groups run that, and if you say there's replacement migration, even though it's an official UN plan, or you say we're all getting raped and stabbed, you go to jail, bitch!
[01:18:45.795 --> 01:18:47.096]  Because we're gonna rape your ass!
[01:18:47.116 --> 01:18:48.437]  You're not talking about the crime!
[01:18:48.917 --> 01:18:51.259]  The ADL says so, so bend over.
[01:18:51.279 --> 01:18:59.125]  The number of reported cases of sexual offenses in Sweden, and look at it, just skyrockets as they bring the Muslims in.
[01:19:01.566 --> 01:19:03.588]  Sweden's migrant rape crisis.
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:06.901]  And I got 50 of these today without even looking.
[01:19:07.302 --> 01:19:10.564]  Illegal aliens allegedly raped woman at knifepoint on Coney Island.
[01:19:10.984 --> 01:19:11.645]  It's happening here.
[01:19:13.806 --> 01:19:17.388]  Then I've got all these videos of the Muslims attacking anybody with a British flag.
[01:19:18.429 --> 01:19:20.671]  You've got a British flag on your shirt in the UK?
[01:19:21.111 --> 01:19:21.912]  You're getting stabbed.
[01:19:21.952 --> 01:19:22.692]  You're getting beat up.
[01:19:22.712 --> 01:19:23.373]  You're getting raped.
[01:19:23.833 --> 01:19:27.015]  And dammit, the police are gonna sit back and say, As-salamu alaykum.
[01:19:31.278 --> 01:19:32.179]  You wanna see these videos?
[01:19:33.690 --> 01:19:35.631]  I've got like a hundred of them the last week, I haven't even played them.
[01:19:37.232 --> 01:19:39.934]  Just, you're white, you're pulled out of your car, you're beat up, you're killed.
[01:19:40.774 --> 01:19:42.295]  Police, Heil Hitler, they love it.
[01:19:47.558 --> 01:19:50.819]  Absolutely disgusting.
[01:19:54.882 --> 01:19:58.744]  And as that video came out a month ago, they tried to block on X, because nowhere else you could get it.
[01:19:59.827 --> 01:20:04.191]  Where this Muslim in Germany is stabbing and killing, he killed people.
[01:20:05.132 --> 01:20:06.353]  He's just stabbing white people.
[01:20:07.794 --> 01:20:14.841]  And a white guy fights him and the police run in and tackle him and are putting him in handcuffs and beating him while the Muslim's still.
[01:20:16.142 --> 01:20:17.844]  And then it comes over and kills the cop.
[01:20:18.084 --> 01:20:19.245]  Bam, bam, bam, bam.
[01:20:21.006 --> 01:20:22.508]  And the police went apeshit.
[01:20:23.462 --> 01:20:25.564]  And they were arresting people that posted the video.
[01:20:25.584 --> 01:20:28.987]  You're like, how dare you show a Muslim kill the cop?
[01:20:29.327 --> 01:20:30.468]  The cop tried to help.
[01:20:31.388 --> 01:20:34.811]  He tried to defend the Muslim, tried to let him carry out his jolly work.
[01:20:37.894 --> 01:20:38.634]  But he was just trained.
[01:20:38.674 --> 01:20:39.935]  Hey, German defending themselves?
[01:20:40.315 --> 01:20:43.198]  Oh my God, it's because the government's raping you.
[01:20:43.518 --> 01:20:45.660]  And the one thing they can't have is you stand up.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.724]  Because if one ant stands up, they might all stand up.
[01:20:51.874 --> 01:20:53.876]  Like Bugs Life, let's play that next time we come in.
[01:20:59.681 --> 01:21:00.361]  And it's that simple.
[01:21:02.083 --> 01:21:04.985]  I mean, look up Muslim, they won't say Islamic, it's not.
[01:21:05.966 --> 01:21:07.307]  They call it Asian rape gangs.
[01:21:08.388 --> 01:21:09.930]  Folks, that's not fair to the Asians.
[01:21:12.532 --> 01:21:16.676]  The Asians, whether they're from Vietnam, or China, or Japan,
[01:21:18.431 --> 01:21:24.414]  Or Philippines have the lowest crime rate and the highest average standard of living.
[01:21:25.875 --> 01:21:28.437]  And if you want to say who's model, I will say it.
[01:21:29.357 --> 01:21:32.279]  Asians are the most model citizens there are.
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:36.381]  And next are the evil white people.
[01:21:38.427 --> 01:21:39.227]  And then the Hispanics.
[01:21:39.367 --> 01:21:48.570]  And I'm not demonizing the other groups that are involved in crime, because most of them aren't, but it's still half the crime, or like 60% in the U.S., is committed by black people.
[01:21:49.010 --> 01:21:49.871]  And I love black.
[01:21:50.111 --> 01:21:51.111]  Good black people are great.
[01:21:51.151 --> 01:21:51.931]  Good white people are great.
[01:21:52.151 --> 01:21:59.513]  There's bad people, but the way the culture's been set up, and the CIA advertising to be a gangster, because blacks weren't the majority of crime until the 70s.
[01:22:01.634 --> 01:22:07.476]  But the point is, we need to fix that in their community, instead of what's been going on there.
[01:22:09.039 --> 01:22:11.782]  And the Democrats would put blacks in jail for small offenses.
[01:22:12.042 --> 01:22:13.424]  Then they get trained how to be a criminal.
[01:22:13.664 --> 01:22:14.966]  This was a plan, folks.
[01:22:15.486 --> 01:22:18.710]  Just like MS-13 being trained by the CIA in the U.S.
[01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:19.951]  and sent back to El Salvador.
[01:22:20.272 --> 01:22:21.734]  And Bukele's talked about that.
[01:22:23.776 --> 01:22:27.981]  So, you can have great countries with black people, brown people, white people.
[01:22:28.021 --> 01:22:28.882]  We can all do it.
[01:22:28.922 --> 01:22:29.743]  We can come together.
[01:22:31.325 --> 01:22:34.007]  But you've got to admit what's happening.
[01:22:34.027 --> 01:22:35.047]  So here's a few of these clips.
[01:22:35.688 --> 01:22:36.408]  This is England.
[01:22:36.468 --> 01:22:43.453]  Gang of Muslims attack a couple of English lads wearing the Union flag in Leeds Center.
[01:22:44.394 --> 01:22:46.055]  Yeah, you can't wear that.
[01:22:47.216 --> 01:22:48.156]  Go ahead and roll that clip.
[01:22:48.176 --> 01:22:52.419]  Here it is.
[01:22:52.439 --> 01:22:53.780]  This is just CCTV camera.
[01:22:54.961 --> 01:22:57.843]  So the gang of Muslims are out looking for the imaginary EDL.
[01:22:59.544 --> 01:23:01.045]  And they see some white guys
[01:23:02.705 --> 01:23:08.149]  With the King George flag, white flag, red cross, and they attack them.
[01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:10.691]  And that's how this works.
[01:23:13.012 --> 01:23:18.236]  And the average Islamicist has got, like, 80% on welfare.
[01:23:18.256 --> 01:23:22.439]  And you always know Islamicists, they wear black, just like Al-Qaeda.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.882]  And, you know, how dare people be proud of their country?
[01:23:26.922 --> 01:23:28.823]  How dare people, when it's under attack, do this?
[01:23:28.863 --> 01:23:29.404]  So, bam!
[01:23:29.424 --> 01:23:30.184]  You're under attack.
[01:23:30.224 --> 01:23:30.525]  Boom!
[01:23:31.545 --> 01:23:32.206]  You're being hit.
[01:23:38.376 --> 01:23:39.858]  And you can tell those Brits are drunk.
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:41.861]  The Muslims aren't.
[01:23:46.026 --> 01:23:47.228]  I can tell you this, man.
[01:23:47.248 --> 01:23:49.110]  Those guys are lucky they weren't getting in a fight with me.
[01:23:49.130 --> 01:23:56.120]  Because every time I punch somebody, they get hurt really bad.
[01:23:58.973 --> 01:24:03.255]  But the point is, is that what I just said is an arrestable offense.
[01:24:03.655 --> 01:24:06.876]  If I say I would defend myself, that is the ultimate crime.
[01:24:07.276 --> 01:24:14.579]  No, you will accept grooming gangs, you will accept rape, you will be stabbed, you will die, you will roll over.
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:25.324]  Yeah, here's the Muslim stabbing the white people in Germany, and then the cop comes and helps him, and so he stabs the cop.
[01:24:28.168 --> 01:24:29.769]  You talk about a suicide pact.
[01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:31.290]  Poor cop.
[01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:32.210]  I'm sad he's dead.
[01:24:33.451 --> 01:24:34.232]  But that's the way it works.
[01:24:34.972 --> 01:24:39.695]  An InfoWars fan favorite is now back in stock after over a year of not being available.
[01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:42.776]  It is the Vitamin C and Zinc with Rosehips.
[01:24:43.297 --> 01:24:49.100]  Now, this is a copy of Linus Pauling, who won the Nobel Prize for his findings on Vitamin C's formula.
[01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:57.285]  It is a thousand milligrams of organic Vitamin C with Zinc to take it into the cells and Rosehips
[01:24:57.805 --> 01:24:58.906]  He believed that supercharger.
[01:24:59.526 --> 01:25:00.907]  This formula is amazing.
[01:25:01.307 --> 01:25:06.410]  We've not had it for over 12 months, and now it's available back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:08.171]  It is simply incredible.

[01:25:20.138 --> 01:25:21.679]  Vitamin C and zinc
[01:25:22.219 --> 01:25:27.001]  More news coming up here on the Alex Jones Show on this live Tuesday edition, August 13, 2024.
[01:25:27.081 --> 01:25:31.282]  Huge guests coming up next hour, deep dive on who really runs the deep state.
[01:25:31.302 --> 01:25:34.783]  But first, here's that clip from Bugs Life I was talking about.
[01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:51.810]  But there was that ant that stood up to me.
[01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:54.051]  Yeah, but we can forget about him.
[01:25:54.091 --> 01:25:56.311]  Yeah, it was just one ant.
[01:25:56.631 --> 01:25:57.612]  One ant.
[01:25:57.632 --> 01:25:59.872]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:26:00.212 --> 01:26:01.773]  It's just one ant.
[01:26:02.653 --> 01:26:03.493]  Yeah, boss.
[01:26:03.533 --> 01:26:04.714]  They're puny.
[01:26:05.734 --> 01:26:06.234]  Puny?
[01:26:07.014 --> 01:26:11.396]  Say, let's pretend this grain is a puny little ant.
[01:26:12.656 --> 01:26:13.196]  Did that hurt?
[01:26:14.176 --> 01:26:14.436]  Nope.
[01:26:14.937 --> 01:26:16.157]  Well, how about this one?
[01:26:17.045 --> 01:26:18.411]  Are you kidding?
[01:26:20.018 --> 01:26:20.821]  How about this?
[01:26:34.013 --> 01:26:39.375]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[01:26:40.115 --> 01:26:44.577]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[01:26:45.097 --> 01:26:49.139]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life!
[01:26:49.959 --> 01:26:51.240]  It's not about food.
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:54.641]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[01:26:55.421 --> 01:26:57.022]  That's why we're going back!
[01:26:58.442 --> 01:27:00.163]  Does anybody else want to stay?
[01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:23.662]  And that's why they targeted me, hell, decades ago, but really one of the full CIA attack.
[01:27:25.642 --> 01:27:26.563]  Seven, eight years ago.
[01:27:27.783 --> 01:27:29.244]  But because of you, we're still here.
[01:27:30.784 --> 01:27:32.585]  And I don't just say that, oh, because of you.
[01:27:33.165 --> 01:27:34.626]  No, it's all because of you.
[01:27:35.246 --> 01:27:37.167]  You hold us in attack formation.
[01:27:37.227 --> 01:27:38.747]  You keep us on air.
[01:27:38.827 --> 01:27:39.728]  You share the articles.
[01:27:39.748 --> 01:27:40.488]  You share the videos.
[01:27:40.548 --> 01:27:41.888]  You aren't the tail.
[01:27:43.009 --> 01:27:43.849]  You're the whole dog.
[01:27:44.929 --> 01:27:46.390]  And when you hunt, we have victory.
[01:27:48.049 --> 01:27:57.993]  So I want to go to the rest of this news, but I just want to say again to listeners, we really do have top-flight products that will amaze you, that will empower you, that will do incredible things for you.
[01:27:58.033 --> 01:28:00.394]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is back in stock.

[01:28:26.993 --> 01:28:29.175]  And without your support, we can't do this.
[01:28:29.275 --> 01:28:30.897]  I'm just asking you, make the decision.
[01:28:32.145 --> 01:28:33.446]  And the whole fight against the New World Order.
[01:28:33.506 --> 01:28:34.206]  Support Trump.
[01:28:34.846 --> 01:28:36.467]  Support Tucker Carlson.
[01:28:36.507 --> 01:28:37.447]  Support Elon Musk.
[01:28:37.908 --> 01:28:39.008]  Please support InfoWars.
[01:28:39.028 --> 01:28:41.769]  The enemy thinks we're a very important part of the fight.
[01:28:41.789 --> 01:28:43.030]  They really are after us.
[01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:44.931]  It takes money to battle these people.
[01:28:45.411 --> 01:28:47.232]  I don't want to spend my time sitting there plugging stuff.
[01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:49.613]  We have the best water filtration, best prices, everything.
[01:28:50.073 --> 01:28:51.314]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:28:52.366 --> 01:28:52.866]  We're good to go.
[01:29:10.839 --> 01:29:11.559]  But this is real.
[01:29:11.579 --> 01:29:12.660]  This isn't a Netflix show.
[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:15.121]  I'm not like some actor here asking for your support.
[01:29:15.161 --> 01:29:17.982]  I'm a real person under real attack, and I've seen victory.
[01:29:18.022 --> 01:29:18.902]  I've seen success.
[01:29:19.482 --> 01:29:22.283]  I know we've got a future, but I can't do it without you.
[01:29:23.263 --> 01:29:24.944]  You're not like some junior player.
[01:29:24.964 --> 01:29:27.965]  We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons here.
[01:29:28.005 --> 01:29:28.985]  This isn't a board game.
[01:29:29.826 --> 01:29:33.847]  This is the real world, folks, and I need your aid.
[01:29:34.947 --> 01:29:35.928]  I need your support.
[01:29:37.122 --> 01:29:38.123]  I need your backing.
[01:29:38.203 --> 01:29:40.364]  I'm humbly asking for it now.
[01:29:41.264 --> 01:29:42.285]  Plus, these are great products.
[01:29:43.906 --> 01:29:47.207]  Ninfoarstore.com or drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:29:48.068 --> 01:29:48.708]  And we're reaching out.
[01:29:48.728 --> 01:29:52.630]  We've got a lot of great sponsors we're going to bring on board, but I just want to cover the news.
[01:29:53.230 --> 01:29:54.231]  You need all these products.
[01:29:54.631 --> 01:29:55.732]  Just do some shopping with us.
[01:29:56.072 --> 01:29:56.992]  It's such a simple thing.
[01:29:57.553 --> 01:29:58.573]  And tell folks about the show.
[01:29:58.613 --> 01:29:58.953]  Thank you.
[01:30:00.474 --> 01:30:01.415]  You're certainly doing that.
[01:30:01.435 --> 01:30:04.256]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:30:04.896 --> 01:30:05.577]  I'm not complaining.
[01:30:07.917 --> 01:30:10.458]  10 million viewers and listeners today, conservatively the tune of the show.
[01:30:10.478 --> 01:30:13.300]  30 million people see the clips.
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:14.961]  That's a very low number.
[01:30:15.201 --> 01:30:16.382]  That's a low estimation.
[01:30:16.662 --> 01:30:17.442]  Probably 50 million.
[01:30:19.183 --> 01:30:22.005]  We had like 2.5 million people just on our streams last night.
[01:30:25.386 --> 01:30:26.107]  And we made like $10,000!
[01:30:28.048 --> 01:30:31.930]  That don't pay the satellites and the bandwidth and all this stuff, man.
[01:30:32.190 --> 01:30:34.091]  I put everything in I've got.
[01:30:35.822 --> 01:30:36.703]  And I don't want to lose.
[01:30:37.824 --> 01:30:38.785]  So, I mean, what do you want me to do?
[01:30:39.766 --> 01:30:40.706]  Hit myself on the head with a hammer?
[01:30:40.726 --> 01:30:42.408]  Because I'm not going to give up.
[01:30:43.709 --> 01:30:46.271]  But then it's like, well, if I beg hard enough, I'll get the money.
[01:30:46.292 --> 01:30:48.473]  And I'm just, I don't want to make the whole show about that.
[01:30:48.494 --> 01:30:50.756]  Will you just put it on your calendar?
[01:30:51.056 --> 01:30:51.817]  Make the decision.
[01:30:52.277 --> 01:30:53.278]  It's up to you.
[01:30:54.619 --> 01:30:55.280]  It's so simple.
[01:30:58.362 --> 01:30:59.223]  You got to make the decision.
[01:31:00.004 --> 01:31:00.825]  Plus they're great products.
[01:31:01.145 --> 01:31:01.826]  Make the decision now.
[01:31:02.509 --> 01:31:07.013]  And if you make the decision not to support, hey, I'm not mad at you, that's between you and, you know, the universe.
[01:31:09.054 --> 01:31:22.845]  Alright, so, I could sit here and play you literally a hundred clubs we haven't gotten to in the last week, of Muslims beating the living hell out of white people, and saying we're gonna kill all you white people, and the police just sitting back watching it, while they attack people with machetes.
[01:31:22.885 --> 01:31:23.986]  I mean, I've shown some of it, but...
[01:31:25.799 --> 01:31:29.360]  I don't normally put out AI stuff, but when we do, we're very clear it's a joke.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:30.721]  But it's not a joke.
[01:31:30.741 --> 01:31:32.281]  This is really what he really is doing.
[01:31:32.301 --> 01:31:45.426]  This is Keir Starmer, the Obama-oid, globalist Prime Minister of England that's at war with their people and already has, in just a week, put thousands of people in prison for their posts saying, Muslims are raping us.
[01:31:45.466 --> 01:31:46.006]  Please stop.
[01:31:46.366 --> 01:31:47.086]  Oh, you can't say that.
[01:31:47.106 --> 01:31:47.907]  I just played the clip earlier.
[01:31:48.767 --> 01:31:49.347]  You just tuned in.
[01:31:49.367 --> 01:31:49.887]  I'm not joking.
[01:31:49.927 --> 01:31:50.508]  I played the clip.
[01:31:50.528 --> 01:31:51.328]  It actually happened.
[01:31:53.288 --> 01:31:55.429]  But this is brilliant.
[01:31:55.949 --> 01:31:57.029]  Lawrence Fox put it out.
[01:31:57.969 --> 01:31:59.290]  Repost, repost, repost.
[01:32:01.130 --> 01:32:03.051]  Here's what his real actions are.
[01:32:03.431 --> 01:32:04.051]  Of course, this is AI.
[01:32:04.131 --> 01:32:06.052]  I didn't actually say this, but his actions are this.
[01:32:06.072 --> 01:32:06.492]  So here it is.
[01:32:06.512 --> 01:32:14.214]  I convened with police chiefs from across the nation to formulate a decisive strategy to address the scourge of white working-class protests.
[01:32:14.874 --> 01:32:20.076]  These far-right thugs have observed BLM riots and Islamic demonstrations and arrogantly assumed they could replicate them.
[01:32:20.874 --> 01:32:25.819]  Let me be unequivocally clear, you do have the right to protest in this country unless you are white and working class.
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:29.102]  You can riot in this country unless you are white and working class.
[01:32:29.522 --> 01:32:33.646]  You can attack and physically assault female officers unless you are white and working class.
[01:32:34.547 --> 01:32:45.198]  You will never be allowed to voice your anger about mass immigration, grooming gangs, organised foreign criminal syndicates, Islamic terrorism that targets our children, and the epidemic of stabbings.
[01:32:46.343 --> 01:32:51.546]  This administration is dedicated to labelling any white individual who openly complains as far right.
[01:32:51.827 --> 01:33:00.652]  We will implement advanced facial recognition technology, specifically targeting crowds of white working class scum, as it would be deemed racist to employ this technology on people of colour.
[01:33:02.413 --> 01:33:03.334]  This country is fucked.
[01:33:04.214 --> 01:33:08.137]  It's only going to get more fucked, and you're all going to endure it like the dirty little fascists you are.
[01:33:08.597 --> 01:33:11.299]  And remember, you will owe nothing and be happy.
[01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:14.070]  Wow, that is powerful.
[01:33:14.110 --> 01:33:16.511]  That's what he's really doing, though it's satire.
[01:33:16.871 --> 01:33:18.531]  The best satire is based in what?
[01:33:19.591 --> 01:33:19.911]  Truth.
[01:33:22.972 --> 01:33:39.174]  So, last point on this, because you can't find statistics like you can in Germany, and Sweden, and France, where 75 to 85, it's in that range, the low is 75, the high is 85, of rape and stabbings are the loving little Islamic sweetsie cakes.
[01:33:41.155 --> 01:33:41.935]  But this is, uh,
[01:33:43.266 --> 01:33:45.108]  Ons.gov.uk.
[01:33:45.868 --> 01:33:47.750]  Assaults broken down by ethnicity.
[01:33:48.951 --> 01:34:02.341]  And they say, in a Freedom of Information Act, I would like to know the incidence of sexual assaults and trafficking by each group proportionally, again with illegal immigrants classified as one group.
[01:34:03.922 --> 01:34:08.466]  The response, we do not hold information about the ethnicity of perpetrators of a crime.
[01:34:11.306 --> 01:34:20.272]  And we'll arrest you and put you in prison in Germany, in Sweden, in France, in England, if you do go get the numbers.
[01:34:20.732 --> 01:34:21.453]  But folks did.
[01:34:23.534 --> 01:34:28.897]  And they found the majority of the rapes and stabbings are committed by the little precious Muslims.
[01:34:31.779 --> 01:34:35.281]  Alarm over surge in migrant murder and rape suspects in Britain.
[01:34:37.763 --> 01:34:40.485]  Rotterham child sex abuse gang of seven guilty.
[01:34:42.977 --> 01:34:43.818]  Slaps on the wrist, though.
[01:34:44.679 --> 01:34:45.619]  Okay, I'm done with that.
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:47.001]  I covered it in great detail.
[01:34:48.662 --> 01:34:49.323]  We completed that.
[01:34:50.704 --> 01:34:56.308]  Okay, before our big guest gets on, we've got quite a few other stacks here.
[01:34:56.328 --> 01:35:02.473]  Before we get into the war news, let's talk about this little doozy that came out yesterday that I barely covered.
[01:35:02.493 --> 01:35:04.115]  I'm going to cover more right now.
[01:35:06.397 --> 01:35:07.698]  And this is a big enchilada.
[01:35:09.211 --> 01:35:16.636]  For those of you that listen daily, you know I said this about probably 50 times or more, because I've seen the pattern.
[01:35:18.458 --> 01:35:24.822]  Remember about two months before a white supremacist went into a Buffalo, mainly black grocery store, and killed a whole bunch of people?
[01:35:25.843 --> 01:35:28.365]  I said, I think they're gonna attack black grocery stores.
[01:35:29.986 --> 01:35:35.430]  Now, you could ask, and the FBI has, how I know this stuff.
[01:35:36.508 --> 01:35:39.791]  And I just take all the data in and then I don't even know how I know it.
[01:35:39.831 --> 01:35:41.553]  It's like, like a code breaker.
[01:35:41.573 --> 01:35:42.453]  I don't know what they're going to do.
[01:35:43.875 --> 01:35:44.115]  But.
[01:35:49.319 --> 01:35:50.220]  I said on air.
[01:35:51.902 --> 01:35:57.206]  The day it happened, July 13th, they shot Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, and I said it a bunch of days after that.
[01:35:58.107 --> 01:35:59.508]  We have the archivist pull up if you want.
[01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:02.091]  I said, look for him to be handled by feds.
[01:36:03.063 --> 01:36:04.163]  To be going to D.C.
[01:36:04.623 --> 01:36:18.888]  and to be getting trained at federal installations, or federally funded installations, and look for a Homeland Security connection to him, just like we saw with, remember, I didn't kill the kids at Sandy Hook, though people think that.
[01:36:20.929 --> 01:36:23.509]  Adam Lanza had CIA-FBI connections.
[01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:23.870]  Look it up.
[01:36:26.190 --> 01:36:27.991]  And again, the same pattern happened again.
[01:36:29.690 --> 01:36:30.751]  And Fox News discovered it.
[01:36:31.351 --> 01:36:42.601]  Thomas Crooks trained at shooting range where multiple federal agencies reportedly trained, including DHS visited the club 43 times, including holidays, since last year.
[01:36:46.765 --> 01:36:50.168]  Attempted Trump assassin Thomas Crooks trained at same gun range used by DHS.
[01:36:54.158 --> 01:37:03.340]  And then you've got the 90-minute stand down, the 26 minutes on the roof, the cops saying, stop him climbing up, Trump saying, hey, you know, him doing that made him miss the shot.
[01:37:05.921 --> 01:37:07.221]  That's a big deal, folks.
[01:37:08.541 --> 01:37:10.462]  That's a big, big deal.
[01:37:10.562 --> 01:37:16.203]  And here's Trump talking about it.
[01:37:20.204 --> 01:37:22.965]  You know, he said he's more of a believer in God now and thanks God for living.
[01:37:25.953 --> 01:37:32.796]  Clip five, he talked about Butler PD rush shooter, because they climb up, they see him.
[01:37:34.097 --> 01:37:36.598]  The cop falls off the roof, breaks his ankle.
[01:37:41.441 --> 01:37:42.581]  And still nothing's being done.
[01:37:43.982 --> 01:37:46.724]  On the main roof, the closest to Trump, no one's there.
[01:37:47.144 --> 01:37:51.106]  And the Secret Service head, it was the acting head, but it was actually the head at the time.
[01:37:51.886 --> 01:37:53.327]  The lady was a front lady, as I said.
[01:37:57.398 --> 01:38:04.262]  Mr. Rowe lied and said he wasn't involved in the stand down and didn't know who did it.
[01:38:04.703 --> 01:38:05.843]  But it turns out he did it.
[01:38:07.144 --> 01:38:12.688]  Here's Trump on the local Butler PD rush shooter and caused him to miss.
[01:38:12.748 --> 01:38:14.409]  And I made that point myself.
[01:38:14.449 --> 01:38:14.749]  Here it is.
[01:38:15.382 --> 01:38:19.303]  Like, how on earth does a shooter get on a roof 130 yards away?
[01:38:19.323 --> 01:38:22.924]  That seems crazy.
[01:38:23.364 --> 01:38:27.084]  I think most people are wondering how on earth could such a thing happen.
[01:38:27.264 --> 01:38:28.665]  Well, you know, I view it as two ways.
[01:38:28.965 --> 01:38:30.445]  There should have been nobody on the roof.
[01:38:30.985 --> 01:38:34.506]  There were people because there were so many tens of thousands of people there.
[01:38:34.866 --> 01:38:36.946]  There were people that were seeing him.
[01:38:37.867 --> 01:38:43.508]  And there was one woman with a red shirt and Trump all over it.
[01:38:43.608 --> 01:38:44.868]  And she's screaming.
[01:38:45.868 --> 01:38:47.069]  That guy's got a gun.
[01:38:47.089 --> 01:38:48.390]  You know, you saw it, probably.
[01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:49.291]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:38:49.311 --> 01:38:50.952]  There's a guy up there with a gun.
[01:38:51.432 --> 01:39:06.063]  It's like, I'm just, I guess, I mean, for my part, and I think probably many members of the public are wondering, how the heck are, you know, basically people wandering by pointing out there's a guy on the roof with a gun.
[01:39:06.123 --> 01:39:06.704]  Yeah.
[01:39:07.804 --> 01:39:11.947]  And they're seeing it, but somehow it's not being addressed.
[01:39:13.608 --> 01:39:14.409]  That does seem crazy.
[01:39:14.429 --> 01:39:15.930]  Well, they're going to learn from this.
[01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:27.218]  The communication between the local police, who sort of had an idea, then ultimately a man lifted himself up to the roof, could barely do it because, you know, he was pulling himself up.
[01:39:28.278 --> 01:39:30.620]  And he saw the man with the gun.
[01:39:31.621 --> 01:39:33.482]  The man with the gun pointed the gun at him.
[01:39:33.502 --> 01:39:36.284]  He thought he was probably going to get shot.
[01:39:36.904 --> 01:39:38.825]  But you know, he was like pulling himself up.
[01:39:39.726 --> 01:39:42.448]  And because of that, he couldn't get to his gun.
[01:39:43.231 --> 01:39:47.973]  And he fell down, actually very badly hurt his leg, his ankle.
[01:39:48.613 --> 01:39:50.693]  I hear very badly, but he fell down.
[01:39:51.194 --> 01:39:55.835]  And he did, from what I understand, he did say there's a guy up there with a gun.
[01:39:56.996 --> 01:40:00.297]  And the shooting started very quickly after that.
[01:40:00.337 --> 01:40:04.478]  I think it forced the shooter to go maybe quicker.
[01:40:04.498 --> 01:40:08.939]  You know, you're supposed to be- Exactly, the cop doing that one thing got him off target.
[01:40:10.925 --> 01:40:18.047]  Believe what happened, but they said from 130 yards, a bad shot would hit that target almost every time.
[01:40:18.327 --> 01:40:20.647]  They said it's like in golf, sinking a two-foot putt.
[01:40:21.768 --> 01:40:23.588]  Yeah, it's not a tough shot.
[01:40:23.628 --> 01:40:25.148]  No, it's not a long shot.
[01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:28.669]  The Secret Service person had the long shot.
[01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:30.990]  He had a, you know, triple the distance, actually.
[01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:35.571]  So, you know, it was a terrible thing.
[01:40:39.699 --> 01:40:42.180]  Such an incredible interview for two hours last night.
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:43.640]  A billion viewers.
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:50.901]  And the media spun it as a failure because of the DDoS attack that delayed it by 45 minutes.
[01:40:51.661 --> 01:40:52.301]  Oh, really?
[01:40:52.642 --> 01:40:53.802]  CNN, 1 million viewers.
[01:40:54.522 --> 01:40:56.122]  ABC News, a million viewers now.
[01:40:57.923 --> 01:40:58.783]  Oh, a billion!
[01:41:00.803 --> 01:41:01.583]  You're the joke.
[01:41:01.743 --> 01:41:02.423]  You're the lie.
[01:41:02.503 --> 01:41:03.204]  You're the fraud.
[01:41:03.264 --> 01:41:04.024]  You're the scam.
[01:41:04.264 --> 01:41:05.064]  People don't like you.
[01:41:06.502 --> 01:41:09.603]  And so they all get together and say it's this big failure because they're the failures.
[01:41:11.303 --> 01:41:12.944]  Here's Trump, says Biden.
[01:41:14.184 --> 01:41:15.965]  Kamala's swap was a coup, which is true.
[01:41:15.985 --> 01:41:16.885]  It's illegal.
[01:41:17.225 --> 01:41:17.745]  Here's Trump.
[01:41:19.085 --> 01:41:22.446]  Don't forget, I beat, I beat Biden.
[01:41:23.387 --> 01:41:25.307]  He failed in the debate miserably.
[01:41:25.867 --> 01:41:28.088]  And, you know, some people said, oh, gee, it's too bad.
[01:41:28.548 --> 01:41:29.848]  It's too bad he did so badly.
[01:41:29.928 --> 01:41:31.049]  Or I did well in the debate.
[01:41:31.069 --> 01:41:32.289]  You know, the first night they said,
[01:41:33.032 --> 01:41:33.392]  Wow.
[01:41:33.972 --> 01:41:38.413]  One of the people at CNN said that was the greatest debate performance I've ever witnessed.
[01:41:38.733 --> 01:41:40.734]  And then two days later, they didn't talk about that.
[01:41:40.754 --> 01:41:41.874]  They just said he was bad.
[01:41:42.254 --> 01:41:42.914]  But that's OK.
[01:41:42.934 --> 01:41:43.895]  That's the way I get treated.
[01:41:43.995 --> 01:41:44.935]  And I don't mind that at all.
[01:41:45.255 --> 01:41:46.275]  What I can tell you is this.
[01:41:47.075 --> 01:41:48.316]  We cannot have a Democrat.
[01:41:48.356 --> 01:41:49.176]  We cannot have her.
[01:41:49.236 --> 01:41:50.176]  She's incompetent.
[01:41:50.276 --> 01:41:52.717]  She's as bad as Biden in a different way.
[01:41:52.797 --> 01:41:54.197]  She hasn't done an interview.
[01:41:55.046 --> 01:41:57.908]  Since this whole scam started.
[01:41:59.048 --> 01:42:00.790]  And say what you want, this was a coup.
[01:42:01.230 --> 01:42:03.751]  This was a coup of a President of the United States.
[01:42:03.771 --> 01:42:08.034]  He didn't want to leave and they said we can do it the nice way or we can do it the hard way.
[01:42:08.704 --> 01:42:12.107]  Yeah, I mean, they just took him out back behind the shed and basically shot him.
[01:42:12.527 --> 01:42:14.189]  Oh, what they did with this guy.
[01:42:14.349 --> 01:42:15.430]  And I'm no fan of his.
[01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:18.272]  And he was a horrible president, the worst president in history.
[01:42:18.573 --> 01:42:22.896]  And one of the reasons he was so bad, first of all, the Israeli attack would have never happened.
[01:42:23.477 --> 01:42:25.459]  Russia would never have attacked Ukraine.
[01:42:25.939 --> 01:42:27.060]  And we'd have no inflation.
[01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:29.282]  And we wouldn't have had the Afghanistan mess.
[01:42:32.605 --> 01:42:35.587]  Here's another really important clip from the very start.
[01:42:36.522 --> 01:42:41.204]  And again, if you go to InfoWars.com, you see every day a front page making sure you're not a robot.
[01:42:41.664 --> 01:42:44.106]  We're under 24-7 DDoS attack.
[01:42:44.706 --> 01:42:45.926]  Billions of attacks a day.
[01:42:46.387 --> 01:42:46.707]  Literally.
[01:42:48.007 --> 01:42:49.248]  And we're just like, well, that's what we do.
[01:42:49.868 --> 01:42:50.929]  See, they just normalize.
[01:42:50.989 --> 01:42:51.989]  Oh, they tried to kill Trump.
[01:42:52.029 --> 01:42:52.850]  That was last month.
[01:42:52.930 --> 01:42:54.070]  You know, that's a TV show.
[01:42:54.791 --> 01:42:55.431]  You know, move on.
[01:42:57.175 --> 01:43:01.419]  And that's really the point we've gotten to, but they're fighting like the devil.
[01:43:01.539 --> 01:43:08.385]  I have Washington Post reporters, others, saying, don't let Trump on air yesterday.
[01:43:08.425 --> 01:43:09.326]  They said, stop him.
[01:43:09.586 --> 01:43:11.568]  The EU sent letters saying, don't do this interview.
[01:43:12.168 --> 01:43:13.309]  They're desperate, folks.
[01:43:13.329 --> 01:43:14.110]  They're criminals.
[01:43:15.031 --> 01:43:17.113]  They're saying you can't hear what Trump has to say?
[01:43:18.554 --> 01:43:19.555]  Here's Elon talking about it.
[01:43:21.152 --> 01:43:23.914]  You know what, either way, Trump- Hey, we got an update from Elon Musk.
[01:43:23.994 --> 01:43:27.236]  Elon Musk says there appears to be a massive DDoS attack happening.
[01:43:27.677 --> 01:43:36.744]  So, this is not a failure of X so much as it is an actual cyber attack happening, probably backed by people supported by the EU and others who have come out and issued threatening letters today.
[01:43:36.764 --> 01:43:39.425]  I mean, I agree with that, because I figure Musk had this updated, yeah.
[01:43:39.966 --> 01:43:41.007]  I think that probably is it.
[01:43:41.247 --> 01:43:43.589]  So, okay, well tell us more what he said.
[01:43:43.629 --> 01:43:44.029]  Read it to us.
[01:43:44.249 --> 01:43:45.170]  Yeah, let me find it real quick.
[01:43:45.190 --> 01:43:46.771]  Hold on, the whole Twitter platform is acting all funky.
[01:43:46.791 --> 01:43:47.352]  Yeah, this is a big deal.
[01:43:47.372 --> 01:43:54.117]  Because the EU literally, I covered it a little bit today, I should have covered it more, the EU sent a letter saying we're watching everything you do and will criminally charge you.
[01:43:54.437 --> 01:44:02.844]  So this is what he said two minutes ago, Elon Musk has 45,000 likes now, said, there appears to be a massive DDoS attack on X, working on shutting it down.
[01:44:02.864 --> 01:44:05.086]  I assume he's referring to the DDoS attack.
[01:44:05.126 --> 01:44:09.309]  He says, worst case, we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation.
[01:44:09.309 --> 01:44:14.250]  All right, so again, think about you live in a free country, or you think you do, and you have a Washington Post reporter, and I have CNN clips, and I have MSNBC clips.
[01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:20.092]  I've got like five, five, six clips of Democrats saying, don't let this interview happen.
[01:44:40.848 --> 01:44:42.389]  That totally discredits them right there.
[01:44:44.409 --> 01:44:59.435]  Don't let Elon Musk talk to him and the EU sends a threatening letter saying we're going to criminally charge you for this while they arrest people for pointing out Muslim rape gangs.
[01:45:03.377 --> 01:45:04.357]  I mean, these are the bad guys.
[01:45:05.157 --> 01:45:06.998]  Here's the Washington Post reporter.
[01:45:07.890 --> 01:45:14.515]  Elon Musk is slated to interview Donald Trump tonight on X. I don't know if the president is going to do it.
[01:45:14.655 --> 01:45:15.776]  Feel free to say if he is or not.
[01:45:16.877 --> 01:45:25.944]  But I think that misinformation on Twitter is not just a campaign issue, it's an America issue.
[01:45:27.165 --> 01:45:37.537]  What role does the White House or the President have in sort of stopping that or stopping the spread of that or sort of intervening in that?
[01:45:37.617 --> 01:45:41.702]  Some of that was about campaign misinformation, but you know, it's a wider thing, right?
[01:45:42.142 --> 01:45:51.124]  You've heard us talk about this many times from here, about the responsibilities that social media platforms have when it comes to misinformation, disinformation.
[01:45:51.144 --> 01:45:59.946]  I don't have anything to read out from here about specific ways that we're working on it, but we believe that, that they have the responsibility.
[01:46:00.706 --> 01:46:03.807]  These are private companies, so we're also mindful of that too.
[01:46:06.027 --> 01:46:12.189]  Look, I think it is incredibly important to call that out as you're doing.
[01:46:12.429 --> 01:46:18.351]  I just don't have any specifics on what we have been doing internally as it relates to the interviews.
[01:46:18.371 --> 01:46:21.072]  And that's something that I'm tracking, and I'm sure the President's not tracking it either.
[01:46:27.173 --> 01:46:27.514]  All right.
[01:46:28.034 --> 01:46:31.735]  I had asked for this two hours ago when the show started.
[01:46:32.901 --> 01:46:41.427]  And I said, I remember a German TV show where they have underage girls advertising to the Islamic invaders, come here, you can get an underage girl.
[01:46:41.827 --> 01:46:45.289]  And I said it was on German TV, on children's television, please find it.
[01:46:45.710 --> 01:46:46.390]  The crew found it.
[01:46:48.571 --> 01:46:50.032]  It took them an hour and a half, which is great.
[01:46:50.133 --> 01:46:50.853]  I get it takes time.
[01:46:53.034 --> 01:46:55.516]  But they found another clip out of Wales.
[01:46:56.994 --> 01:46:59.156]  That we showed on screen that I asked for a printout of it.
[01:46:59.637 --> 01:47:00.197]  Maybe I got it.
[01:47:00.237 --> 01:47:00.738]  I'm missing it.
[01:47:01.458 --> 01:47:06.143]  I didn't know Wales had 12-year-old girls advertised for the illegals to come.
[01:47:06.183 --> 01:47:06.903]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:47:08.105 --> 01:47:10.227]  So this is a big deal.
[01:47:14.471 --> 01:47:17.013]  So, I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[01:47:17.794 --> 01:47:20.496]  I mean, who could even imagine something like this?
[01:47:21.357 --> 01:47:22.138]  So we're going to go to break.
[01:47:23.595 --> 01:47:30.641]  I'm going to come back and play the German children's program about come here and have sex with our children.
[01:47:32.242 --> 01:47:33.583]  And then we've got the clip.
[01:47:35.164 --> 01:47:38.067]  And again, they use a girl that looks older to make it legitimate.
[01:47:38.387 --> 01:47:45.913]  And I had a clip I posted on X yesterday of Islamic marriages in the UK of 10 year olds to 35 year old men.
[01:47:47.494 --> 01:47:48.455]  I mean, wow.
[01:47:50.109 --> 01:47:52.290]  That was in yesterday's club, see if you can find that too.
[01:47:53.050 --> 01:48:08.896]  So maybe I should just come back without commentary and play the German newscast for kids, the UK broadcast for kids, and the clip of the 35-year-old with the 10-year-old who he's having sex with.
[01:48:09.557 --> 01:48:13.278]  I mean, like, well, it's their culture, let's just let them do it.
[01:48:13.358 --> 01:48:16.279]  I mean, do we have no morals?
[01:48:16.299 --> 01:48:17.259]  Do we have no bottom?
[01:48:17.339 --> 01:48:18.320]  Is there no end to this?
[01:48:20.618 --> 01:48:21.198]  It's insane.
[01:48:21.838 --> 01:48:28.720]  So, anger, as underage migrant and controversial teen love children's documentary revealed as adult.
[01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:36.721]  German TV shows kids, shows migrant adult dating underage teen girl.
[01:48:37.902 --> 01:48:46.884]  And then, I didn't even know when I told them to search it, they'd find something out of Wales, and here's the other one, with a 10-year-old girl, with her 30-something-year-old husband.
[01:48:48.004 --> 01:48:48.884]  I mean, like,
[01:48:50.754 --> 01:48:55.896]  But if you say this, they arrest you in the UK because the government is pedophiles.
[01:48:58.738 --> 01:49:06.701]  It's like the current Prime Minister was the prosecutor that covered up for Jimmy Savelle who was raping and murdering children.
[01:49:08.822 --> 01:49:16.346]  The current UK Prime Minister literally protected people raping and murdering little boys and girls.
[01:49:17.321 --> 01:49:18.722]  That sounds insane, doesn't it?
[01:49:19.063 --> 01:49:19.983]  But that's who they are.
[01:49:20.224 --> 01:49:21.465]  Who would do COVID lockdowns?
[01:49:21.985 --> 01:49:26.929]  Who would send in troops to shoot people with paintballs that were on their front porches during COVID?
[01:49:26.970 --> 01:49:27.670]  Who would do this?
[01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:28.551]  Pedophiles.
[01:49:29.552 --> 01:49:30.613]  Bad people, folks.
[01:49:30.653 --> 01:49:32.755]  They're into being evil.
[01:49:32.795 --> 01:49:34.516]  They get a thrill out of it.
[01:49:34.897 --> 01:49:42.743]  I get a thrill out of an ice-cold beer in a sunset, or enchiladas, or a steak, or great Italian food.
[01:49:43.404 --> 01:49:44.105]  It never gets old.
[01:49:45.077 --> 01:49:48.759]  For the globalists, though, it's all about hurting good people.
[01:49:52.382 --> 01:49:52.582]  Yep.
[01:49:53.623 --> 01:49:59.646]  The Welsh Refugee Council is using 12-year-old girls in ads meant to entice migrant men to come to Wales.
[01:50:00.307 --> 01:50:04.930]  The Refugee Council is a far-left group using children as bait.
[01:50:06.485 --> 01:50:10.469]  You've seen what President Trump has gone through in the last eight years.
[01:50:10.489 --> 01:50:13.272]  And you've seen a lot of the things that Infowars has gone through.
[01:50:13.293 --> 01:50:19.960]  And I want to thank all of you over the years for your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support, because without you, we would not be on the air.
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:25.125]  Now, without getting into a two-hour long story, in the process of the bankruptcy in the last two years,
[01:50:25.806 --> 01:50:37.372]  We were basically sabotaged and the people that were brought in here to supposedly run things didn't reorder product, even though there was plenty of money at the time, to basically put this operation in a position of shutting down.
[01:50:37.973 --> 01:50:46.757]  But by the grace of God, years ago, I set up backup supplement line from one of the main providers of the raw materials we were using.
[01:50:47.197 --> 01:50:49.919]  And so many of these InfoWars MD products
[01:50:50.559 --> 01:50:56.326]  Are actually our famous products simply private labeled and others are different formulas this company offers.
[01:50:56.646 --> 01:50:57.667]  They're all top of the line.
[01:50:57.687 --> 01:50:58.728]  They're already best sellers.
[01:50:59.009 --> 01:51:04.475]  They're already all over the market and in stores and online under other names, but they are all the very best.
[01:51:04.955 --> 01:51:07.058]  So this line is called Info Wars MD.
[01:51:08.072 --> 01:51:09.794]  Our supplements are basically all sold out.
[01:51:10.175 --> 01:51:13.799]  Only a few things are left, like X2, X3, and some of the other amazing products.
[01:51:14.219 --> 01:51:16.782]  But with InfoWars MD, you have Turmeric 95.
[01:51:17.283 --> 01:51:20.186]  That is the same formula as Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:51:20.547 --> 01:51:22.409]  You have the Nitric Boost.
[01:51:22.429 --> 01:51:24.191]  It's so good for your heart and cardiovascular system.
[01:51:24.531 --> 01:51:26.654]  It is the exact same formula.
[01:51:26.914 --> 01:51:28.456]  So, our Nitric Boost is sold out.
[01:51:28.736 --> 01:51:29.957]  They have their Nitric Boost.
[01:51:30.237 --> 01:51:33.661]  They even let us use their name, Nitric Boost, a few years ago.
[01:51:33.701 --> 01:51:38.686]  So, they're the original makers of this that Dr. Mankiewicz and others have talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[01:51:39.126 --> 01:51:41.469]  So, these are all really amazing products.
[01:51:41.489 --> 01:51:47.555]  You want to check out the line of InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com and it funds our operation.
[01:51:48.055 --> 01:51:50.737]  Obviously, silver is doing way better than gold in growth, and it's way undervalued.
[01:51:50.757 --> 01:51:51.318]  That's a fact.
[01:51:51.358 --> 01:51:53.780]  Why, then, are the central banks mainly hoarding gold?
[01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:55.361]  Well, because there's simply not enough silver.
[01:52:15.436 --> 01:52:15.596]  Right?
[01:52:15.656 --> 01:52:27.282]  It's like, if you've got central banks that start allocating into silver, when it's $30 an ounce and they want to have it be part of their reserves, it's like, okay, there's not enough silver in the world to do that.
[01:52:27.862 --> 01:52:28.243]  Right?
[01:52:28.323 --> 01:52:32.985]  So they have to do gold because it's $2,400 an ounce, not $30 an ounce.
[01:52:33.145 --> 01:52:33.765]  Right?
[01:52:33.825 --> 01:52:36.467]  So this is why central banks own gold.
[01:52:36.487 --> 01:52:42.390]  They've got so many quadrillions of fake money, there's too much fiat to even buy the silver.
[01:52:42.910 --> 01:52:46.913]  Which I would say then means silver still will always be the thing that grows the most.
[01:52:47.674 --> 01:52:57.742]  So silver, historically the numbers prove out that when gold is in a bull market, which it is, we're near all-time highs, silver does better than gold.
[01:52:57.782 --> 01:52:59.244]  So silver grows faster.
[01:52:59.624 --> 01:53:00.805]  And there's a reason why.
[01:53:01.265 --> 01:53:02.967]  Silver and gold both act as
[01:53:03.487 --> 01:53:06.328]  Barometers to government distrust, right?
[01:53:07.308 --> 01:53:10.668]  The worst things get, the better financial metals do.
[01:53:10.708 --> 01:53:12.028]  They're a flight for safety.
[01:53:12.449 --> 01:53:16.749]  But what silver has that gold doesn't is it's a manufacturing metal.
[01:53:16.849 --> 01:53:23.731]  It's used in industry, so in aerospace, in defense, in electronics, in solar power, electric vehicles, all of that.
[01:53:24.171 --> 01:53:29.171]  The demand for silver is through the roof, Alex, and we're just taking advantage of that.
[01:53:29.191 --> 01:53:31.932]  And imagine what silver will do
[01:53:32.532 --> 01:53:42.064]  With Trump being president, somebody who actually grows the economy rather than having a stagnant economy, the industrial need for silver is absolutely going to explode.
[01:53:42.264 --> 01:53:42.744]  No, you're right.
[01:53:42.825 --> 01:53:44.707]  Silver is the closest thing to a silver bullet.
[01:53:45.147 --> 01:53:46.289]  That's why they call it a silver bullet.
[01:53:46.309 --> 01:53:49.853]  People should go to kpm.com forward slash gold right now and get silver now.
[01:53:49.873 --> 01:53:50.294]  We'll be right back.
[01:53:57.250 --> 01:54:02.773]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:54:06.034 --> 01:54:10.257]  Incredible researcher Greg Stenstrom is coming up on the Deep State.
[01:54:10.797 --> 01:54:12.618]  This analysis is beyond critical.
[01:54:13.458 --> 01:54:21.822]  But first, since I mentioned it, here's a few clips of the Democrats and Liberals running TV ads about coming to Europe to have sex with our children.
[01:54:22.963 --> 01:54:25.624]  I met a loss for words.
[01:54:25.684 --> 01:54:26.705]  My words fail me.
[01:54:28.371 --> 01:54:29.171]  To describe you.
[01:54:30.012 --> 01:54:33.454]  When you lie with your head on my heart, I feel so alive.
[01:54:34.294 --> 01:54:36.395]  You give me more life, more joy.
[01:54:36.415 --> 01:54:37.856]  And me?
[01:54:38.716 --> 01:54:39.237]  Who am I?
[01:54:40.737 --> 01:54:44.739]  We got together on the 12th and on the 13th, he gave this to me.
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:46.680]  I just thought it was sweet.
[01:54:47.121 --> 01:54:50.362]  Despite his flaws, his intention mattered most.
[01:54:51.743 --> 01:54:52.884]  Her eyes, especially.
[01:54:53.664 --> 01:54:54.785]  I love her blue eyes.
[01:54:55.705 --> 01:54:57.186]  That's what I love most about her.
[01:54:59.384 --> 01:55:00.084]  About her, I mean.
[01:55:00.704 --> 01:55:02.145]  You can really dive into them.
[01:55:04.726 --> 01:55:05.626]  You see so much.
[01:55:05.986 --> 01:55:08.467]  You can truly understand her through her eyes.
[01:55:08.687 --> 01:55:09.447]  That I can say.
[01:55:09.667 --> 01:55:11.167]  I'll do anything to make you happy.
[01:55:12.988 --> 01:55:13.728]  I promise you.
[01:55:14.988 --> 01:55:15.709]  I promise you.
[01:55:16.749 --> 01:55:18.590]  That's why I sent my spirit to you.
[01:55:20.710 --> 01:55:23.351]  My writing may not convey my feelings clearly.
[01:55:24.711 --> 01:55:26.992]  But I'll show, not tell, how I feel.
[01:55:29.987 --> 01:55:30.447]  I love you.
[01:55:33.948 --> 01:55:36.449]  I'll be there in about 20 to 30 minutes, okay?
[01:55:37.389 --> 01:55:37.949]  Okay, good.
[01:55:38.009 --> 01:55:38.449]  See you then.
[01:55:42.090 --> 01:55:44.771]  At first, he was both a stranger and not at all.
[01:55:48.412 --> 01:55:51.553]  He wasn't unfamiliar, as that's how I met and fell for him.
[01:55:53.013 --> 01:55:55.134]  Or is it silly to say fell for him?
[01:55:56.334 --> 01:55:57.134]  I simply love him.
[01:55:58.055 --> 01:55:59.095]  There's nothing more to learn.
[01:56:03.655 --> 01:56:05.356]  My girlfriend's name is Malvina.
[01:56:06.076 --> 01:56:07.016]  She's six years old.
[01:56:08.637 --> 01:56:09.297]  Very cool.
[01:56:09.637 --> 01:56:10.298]  And I love her.
[01:56:11.718 --> 01:56:14.479]  Dia is from Aleppo, Syria, where she was born.
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:18.401]  We've been together for 17 months.
[01:56:20.062 --> 01:56:21.722]  I fled from Syria to Germany.
[01:56:24.323 --> 01:56:25.564]  I came as a refugee.
[01:56:28.105 --> 01:56:30.946]  These strong feelings for him are indescribable.
[01:56:35.373 --> 01:56:38.235]  Words fail to capture it, even in a dictionary.
[01:56:40.137 --> 01:56:42.940]  Our relationship has had and will have hurdles.
[01:56:47.103 --> 01:56:50.466]  For instance, he often steers me where I don't want to go.
[01:56:53.709 --> 01:56:55.971]  I can't wear short clothes, only long ones.
[01:57:00.731 --> 01:57:04.515]  Dresses must be knee-length, nothing more, and not shorter.
[01:57:04.715 --> 01:57:06.797]  I can't accept my wife looking like that.
[01:57:10.701 --> 01:57:12.182]  Hello, and welcome to Wales.
[01:57:12.903 --> 01:57:15.025]  We understand being a refugee isn't easy.
[01:57:15.085 --> 01:57:16.086]  They go through so much.
[01:57:16.507 --> 01:57:20.451]  Fleeing your country is difficult, but Wales wants to help you feel welcome.
[01:57:20.731 --> 01:57:23.013]  The Welsh Refugee Council is here to help you.
[01:57:23.234 --> 01:57:24.355]  You can contact them here.
[01:57:26.877 --> 01:57:29.059]  Wales is seen as a nation of centuries.
[01:57:29.099 --> 01:57:31.161]  We welcome anyone and everyone.
[01:57:31.181 --> 01:57:32.882]  We recognise your skills and talent.
[01:57:32.962 --> 01:57:40.769]  The Welsh Refugee Council offers a lot of support, including... ESOL classes, which means English for Speakers for Other Languages.
[01:57:41.190 --> 01:57:43.732]  It may be harder than our language, so we offer support.
[01:57:44.332 --> 01:57:44.913]  Employment.
[01:57:45.073 --> 01:57:47.495]  You may feel stressed about employment, but we can help.
[01:57:47.935 --> 01:57:51.939]  They help you to apply for bank accounts, child benefits... Again, this is 12-year-olds.
[01:57:53.773 --> 01:57:56.049]  Advertising all the free stuff to the Muslims.
[01:57:57.062 --> 01:57:58.283]  They're actually watching this.
[01:57:59.324 --> 01:58:00.985]  These get millions of views.
[01:58:02.466 --> 01:58:15.197]  You can't make this up!
[01:58:15.237 --> 01:58:19.680]  We also have a clip of a pick-up artist training migrants how to pick up women.
[01:58:20.141 --> 01:58:24.825]  You know, we're out of time, our guest is coming up, but Chase, every time you pop in here, just do it live on air.
[01:58:25.615 --> 01:58:27.536]  Okay, I want people to hear everything that's going on here.
[01:58:27.596 --> 01:58:28.396]  Total transparency.
[01:58:28.416 --> 01:58:30.937]  Because the crew doesn't tell me what to say, but they pop in with ideas.
[01:58:31.537 --> 01:58:35.399]  I want that added in post, with all the other videos I don't have time to get to.
[01:58:35.419 --> 01:58:38.860]  Because we're live right now, it's 1.04 Central, 27 seconds.
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:44.342]  They have this huge guest coming up, but I just add it all, give it to Wilson, who's doing an incredible job.
[01:58:44.362 --> 01:58:47.484]  Those will all be posted on X, it'll all be posted to Band Up Video.
[01:58:48.064 --> 01:58:49.484]  But they really don't want this to be seen.
[01:58:49.544 --> 01:58:50.225]  It will be seen.
[01:58:50.925 --> 01:58:54.447]  We will be seeing you dirty scum, you New World Order pedophiles.
[01:58:54.787 --> 01:58:55.867]  We're gonna get your ass.
[01:58:55.907 --> 01:58:57.568]  I got my hands around your throat.
[01:58:57.868 --> 01:58:59.409]  You can feel it, can't you?
[01:58:59.529 --> 01:59:00.449]  I know you can.
[01:59:00.769 --> 01:59:04.591]  I'm gonna get your ass.
[01:59:05.031 --> 01:59:13.255]  Horst Wenzel, dubbed Germany's number one love expert, has been volunteering his services to teach new migrants how to flirt and approach women.
[01:59:14.168 --> 01:59:26.230]  The 27-year-old, who makes his living teaching wealthy but shy German men, has recently decided to offer his advice to young Syrian and Iraqi refugees in Dortmund, most of them from war-torn Muslim countries.
[01:59:28.994 --> 01:59:32.938]  Some German women are a bit racist towards us, said this Syrian refugee.
[01:59:33.438 --> 01:59:35.860]  They don't know how refugees think or how they are living.
[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:37.682]  Some people are getting the wrong idea.
[01:59:41.065 --> 01:59:44.868]  The way of living in the Middle East is different than the way people live here in Europe.
[01:59:45.549 --> 01:59:46.870]  Religion and manners are different.
[01:59:50.232 --> 01:59:53.174]  We don't enjoy all the freedoms that you have here in Germany.
[01:59:56.076 --> 02:00:08.645]  While a part of the population is said to be against this project, as it is conducted in a country where Europe's migrant influx is already having deep political and social consequences, some German women seem receptive to the idea.
[02:00:11.384 --> 02:00:13.345]  Human touch, honesty, trust.
[02:00:13.525 --> 02:00:15.946]  That's what matters, insisted this local resident.
[02:00:16.346 --> 02:00:18.447]  Then I don't care whether he's from Syria or not.
[02:00:20.428 --> 02:00:21.229]  I'm a free woman.
[02:00:21.549 --> 02:00:25.631]  I don't want to be restricted, but otherwise, yes, if he's open-minded, it can work.
[02:00:28.292 --> 02:00:35.716]  According to reports, last year alone, around 890,000 people applied for asylum, with hundreds of thousands more applying this year.
[02:00:35.736 --> 02:00:38.618]  What's your name?
[02:00:38.638 --> 02:00:38.798]  Mohasin.
[02:00:38.838 --> 02:00:39.138]  How old are you?
[02:00:39.821 --> 02:00:40.362]  Now I'm 10.
[02:00:41.262 --> 02:00:43.084]  Now you're 10 years old?
[02:00:43.264 --> 02:00:43.384]  Yes.
[02:00:44.705 --> 02:00:45.446]  Do you go to school?
[02:00:46.867 --> 02:00:46.947]  No.
[02:00:46.967 --> 02:00:51.451]  What grade are you in?
[02:00:51.511 --> 02:00:53.052]  I'm in 3rd grade.
[02:00:53.072 --> 02:00:54.934]  Who takes you to school?
[02:00:54.954 --> 02:00:56.295]  My fiancé, Ahmed.
[02:00:56.335 --> 02:00:57.276]  Are you engaged?
[02:00:57.296 --> 02:00:59.257]  How old is Ahmed?
[02:00:59.277 --> 02:00:59.698]  I don't know.
[02:00:59.718 --> 02:01:00.778]  How old?
[02:01:00.799 --> 02:01:00.999]  No.
[02:01:01.019 --> 02:01:03.821]  Is Ahmed big or small?
[02:01:03.841 --> 02:01:04.061]  He's tall.
[02:01:07.637 --> 02:01:08.738]  Good evening, Ahmed.
[02:01:08.778 --> 02:01:10.179]  Good evening.
[02:01:10.199 --> 02:01:10.899]  Who is Mahasin?
[02:01:11.699 --> 02:01:12.080]  My fiancée.
[02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:14.801]  How old are you, Ahmed?
[02:01:15.201 --> 02:01:16.182]  I'm 25 years old.
[02:01:16.202 --> 02:01:17.563]  You're 25 years old.
[02:01:17.583 --> 02:01:19.904]  And Mahasin is 10 years old.
[02:01:19.944 --> 02:01:22.206]  How old was she when you first met her?
[02:01:22.226 --> 02:01:24.087]  She was 8 years old.
[02:01:24.107 --> 02:01:26.028]  She was 8 years old when you first met her?
[02:01:26.048 --> 02:01:26.668]  She was 11 years old.
[02:01:31.254 --> 02:01:32.054]  How did you meet her?
[02:01:32.294 --> 02:01:33.875]  I mean, there's a bond between us.
[02:01:34.195 --> 02:01:35.035]  There's a bond between you?
[02:01:36.055 --> 02:01:36.195]  Yes.
[02:01:36.215 --> 02:01:36.955]  When did you get married?
[02:01:37.616 --> 02:01:38.096]  Married?
[02:01:38.136 --> 02:01:39.216]  Just to grow a little.
[02:01:39.236 --> 02:01:39.756]  I mean, when?
[02:01:39.776 --> 02:01:40.576]  About a year.
[02:01:41.497 --> 02:01:42.897]  Just to get a little older, I guess.
[02:01:42.937 --> 02:01:47.678]  What's the difference between now, 10 years old, and a year later?
[02:01:47.698 --> 02:01:48.458]  What's the difference?
[02:01:48.478 --> 02:01:49.579]  There's a big difference.
[02:01:58.686 --> 02:02:00.507]  What do you hate, Ahmed, about a 10-year-old girl?
[02:02:00.967 --> 02:02:03.768]  What do you hate about a 10-year-old girl?
[02:02:04.288 --> 02:02:08.010]  What do you hate about a 10-year-old girl?
[02:02:23.502 --> 02:02:25.163]  I've been with my wife for 3 years.
[02:02:25.503 --> 02:02:27.205]  I mean, I loved her.
[02:02:27.305 --> 02:02:27.965]  She loved me.
[02:02:27.985 --> 02:02:31.087]  You know, marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman.
[02:02:31.167 --> 02:02:37.312]  It's an intellectual harmony, an emotional harmony, but also a physical relationship, a harmony, and a physical attraction.
[02:02:37.332 --> 02:02:43.035]  What attracted you to a 10-year-old girl?
[02:02:43.075 --> 02:02:49.960]  I mean, I'll tell you again, I told you, and I'll tell you again, I loved her, and I asked her to be my wife.
[02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:52.342]  Because I... Maybe I'm taking myself too far now.
[02:02:53.106 --> 02:02:55.007]  You're not a part of it, Alec.
[02:02:55.027 --> 02:02:56.528]  I'm going to ask you a question again.
[02:02:56.668 --> 02:03:00.811]  What does a man with a child's body have that hasn't matured yet?
[02:03:00.871 --> 02:03:02.072]  A child's body?
[02:03:02.092 --> 02:03:03.333]  There's no feminine meaning to this child.
[02:03:03.353 --> 02:03:04.433]  To all children.
[02:03:04.474 --> 02:03:06.915]  When you pass a beautiful woman next to you, what do you look at?
[02:03:06.935 --> 02:03:09.057]  I look at her beauty.
[02:03:09.697 --> 02:03:13.459]  When you pass a 10-year-old child, what does a child's body have that hasn't matured yet?
[02:03:13.479 --> 02:03:17.962]  Hasn't matured to the point of... That you see her as a woman.
[02:03:18.022 --> 02:03:18.743]  I'm telling you again.
[02:03:21.255 --> 02:03:23.176]  I fell in love with this girl.
[02:03:23.196 --> 02:03:24.876]  But I understood the question.
[02:03:24.896 --> 02:03:25.056]  Yes, yes.
[02:03:25.076 --> 02:03:26.617]  Did you see a woman in her?
[02:03:26.677 --> 02:03:27.977]  I'll tell you again.
[02:03:28.057 --> 02:03:28.718]  I loved her.
[02:03:29.238 --> 02:03:29.718]  I loved her.
[02:03:30.178 --> 02:03:30.998]  I mean, I raised her.
[02:03:31.018 --> 02:03:32.579]  I mean, she understands everything.
[02:03:32.699 --> 02:03:34.240]  I talk to her, she talks to me.
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:39.821]  Like, like, I mean, Glory be to God, sometimes when I sit with her and talk to her, she's a big talker.
[02:03:39.881 --> 02:03:42.622]  I mean, she's conscious, she understands me.
[02:03:42.682 --> 02:03:49.405]  In your opinion, in your opinion, a marriage with Mahaser is a competitive marriage and a successful marriage, in your opinion?
[02:03:49.425 --> 02:03:50.065]  100% in my opinion.
[02:03:51.703 --> 02:03:52.524]  100% success rate.
[02:04:05.089 --> 02:04:07.951]  But he has done an amazing deep dive.
[02:04:07.971 --> 02:04:13.355]  I have hundreds of pages of research and I had him come on last week and only read like 100 pages.
[02:04:13.375 --> 02:04:16.557]  So I said, let's move into this week because I wanted to read it all.
[02:04:16.617 --> 02:04:20.940]  I did read it all yesterday, over 400 pages of it.
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:24.602]  He's done an excellent analysis because I've done my own research, so I know it's accurate.
[02:04:24.983 --> 02:04:29.406]  He's gone really, really deep on who is the deep state commanders.
[02:04:30.446 --> 02:04:36.968]  And Ivan Rehnquist has done a great job, Defense Intelligence Agency lawyer, Patriot, on the general group, you know, hundreds of them.
[02:04:36.988 --> 02:04:38.869]  But who are the generals?
[02:04:38.929 --> 02:04:46.091]  Who are the field marshals that obviously tried to kill Trump a month ago and are doing all of this?
[02:04:46.711 --> 02:04:48.391]  And so Greg's done a great job.
[02:04:48.451 --> 02:04:51.792]  Patriot.online, you can find him there.
[02:04:52.613 --> 02:04:56.494]  He's the co-author of best-selling book, The Parallel Election, A Blueprint for Deception.
[02:04:57.454 --> 02:05:04.476]  He has co-defendants with President Trump in a landmark defamation lawsuit in Philadelphia, and it just goes on from there.
[02:05:04.496 --> 02:05:20.000]  We're talking about the counsel and who is running the government, assassination attempt on President Trump, removal of Biden, installation of Harris, and the counsel on Trump, Alex Jones, Roger Stone, General Flynn, Christina Bob,
[02:05:21.903 --> 02:05:25.644]  Joe Hoff, Steve Bannon, and ordinary citizens like Stenstrom.
[02:05:26.284 --> 02:05:30.946]  And so we're going to break it all down with him right now and try to give him the floor for the hour.
[02:05:31.486 --> 02:05:36.748]  And we'll tell you, we can go read the counsel who is running the United States Department of Just Us.
[02:05:37.288 --> 02:05:38.669]  Here's the report for TV viewers.
[02:05:39.909 --> 02:05:41.930]  You should spend your time reading this.
[02:05:41.950 --> 02:05:43.050]  We'll tell you where to find it.
[02:05:43.850 --> 02:05:46.171]  But Greg, thank you so much for being with us today.
[02:05:48.432 --> 02:05:49.032]  Good to be here.
[02:05:50.583 --> 02:05:51.944]  I've been looking forward to it.
[02:05:51.964 --> 02:05:55.866]  I've been a big fan for years, and it's a pleasure to be on your show.
[02:05:56.627 --> 02:06:01.429]  Well, I knew your report was important, and people in the Trump campaign at a high level said I should talk to you.
[02:06:01.469 --> 02:06:04.851]  I've seen some of your work before, but I'm going to try to just shut up and give you the floor.
[02:06:05.251 --> 02:06:12.736]  Let's begin as we zero in on not the entire deep state, because that can get dizzying, but on the key commanders here, kind of the deck of cards.
[02:06:13.216 --> 02:06:16.298]  Let's talk about who is in this coup against America.
[02:06:18.942 --> 02:06:19.222]  Sure.
[02:06:20.083 --> 02:06:34.137]  Just to kind of preface, and before we get into it, I've been involved since the 2020 election in the statutory role as an authorized representative and certified poll watcher.
[02:06:34.778 --> 02:06:41.825]  And over the past four years, I've been involved in a number of lawsuits, including the defamation suit where we're co-defendants with President Trump.
[02:06:43.329 --> 02:06:46.571]  Which we won, by the way, using tooth as a complete defense.
[02:06:47.231 --> 02:07:01.262]  And over that period of time, I've been working with a close group of friends, Colonel and Dr. Timothy Shindelar and I are close friends, and I want to make sure I properly credit a lot of this work to him.
[02:07:01.282 --> 02:07:03.203]  You're a doctor as well, so go ahead.
[02:07:03.243 --> 02:07:04.484]  No, no, no, no, I'm not a doctor.
[02:07:11.584 --> 02:07:13.005]  No, Bachelor's of Science, Maryland.
[02:07:13.045 --> 02:07:15.026]  You saw Annapolis, Maryland.
[02:07:15.106 --> 02:07:16.748]  So I'm a U.S.
[02:07:16.788 --> 02:07:17.968]  Naval Academy graduate.
[02:07:18.429 --> 02:07:21.551]  So let's plunge into it.
[02:07:22.912 --> 02:07:23.632]  Let's get into it.
[02:07:23.692 --> 02:07:33.419]  So the premise of the article and the reason for the show today was the there's a control group within this country that was developed in 1978.
[02:07:36.604 --> 02:07:45.930]  In response to the Watergate scandal, for the people old enough to remember that with Nixon and so forth, and there was the creation of a group called the Council.
[02:07:46.730 --> 02:07:49.272]  The Council is what they were originally created as.
[02:07:49.392 --> 02:07:58.318]  It's also known as the CIGIE, C-I-G-I-E, but I want to refer to it for the Council to keep people on track.
[02:07:59.259 --> 02:07:59.379]  And
[02:08:00.140 --> 02:08:09.467]  What they've done is they initially formed for, I think, good, the Inspector General Corps, combined with the FBI and the Department of Justice.
[02:08:10.848 --> 02:08:15.472]  They were what's called a sui generis operation, a group of untouchables.
[02:08:15.692 --> 02:08:25.139]  Sui generis means unto themselves, so that they could investigate anyone, including the President of the United States, members of Congress, the Senate,
[02:08:27.102 --> 02:08:30.283]  Global ogle arcs, uh, masters of business.
[02:08:30.863 --> 02:08:33.304]  So I think the group was originally formed.
[02:08:33.944 --> 02:08:41.626]  I'm going to say whether it was good intentions or not, but they created a tremendous amount of power and put it in a small group of people's hands.
[02:08:42.627 --> 02:08:48.008]  And what's happened is, is that has been twisted over the last 50 years.
[02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:53.850]  And this group has become basically the people who run the United States of America.
[02:08:54.799 --> 02:09:07.188]  And, you know, to say them by name is the simplest thing, but the Council currently, the top level of the Council, is Inspector General Michael Horowitz, FBI Director Christopher Wray, U.S.
[02:09:07.249 --> 02:09:19.598]  Attorney General Merrick Garland, the Director of Office of Professional Responsibility Jeffrey Ragsdale, the Chief Public Integrity Secretary called the PIN, which is Corey Emmonson,
[02:09:20.422 --> 02:09:21.203]  And Deputy U.S.
[02:09:21.263 --> 02:09:25.669]  Attorney Lisa Monaco and First Principal Deputy Marshall Miller.
[02:09:26.931 --> 02:09:37.324]  That group is at the pinnacle or the head of the council, and they have the power to indict anyone they want, and they've done so.
[02:09:37.364 --> 02:09:38.486]  They indicted President Trump.
[02:09:39.555 --> 02:09:45.399]  They have the power to hold investigations or obstruct investigations.
[02:09:45.939 --> 02:09:52.022]  And that's where I originally touched on them in the group I'm working with that includes Dr. Shindelar.
[02:09:52.803 --> 02:09:54.124]  They originally contacted me.
[02:09:54.284 --> 02:09:55.644]  We were classmates as well.
[02:09:56.305 --> 02:10:03.349]  But the obstruction of the massive election fraud of 2020, the obstruction of investigations,
[02:10:03.949 --> 02:10:06.530]  Is where I came into contact with them.
[02:10:06.550 --> 02:10:14.573]  There's multiple other people, whistleblowers in the federal government that they've obstructed cases.
[02:10:14.613 --> 02:10:17.654]  And that's part of the article where we explain where that came from.
[02:10:18.374 --> 02:10:30.659]  But they basically weaponized government agencies by placing inspectors general in each of these government agencies, CIA, NSA, pick an agency.
[02:10:31.339 --> 02:10:32.960]  They've got an inspector general in there.
[02:10:33.661 --> 02:10:43.186]  And that Inspector General reports to Inspector General Horowitz, and that group is what really controls the United States.
[02:10:43.206 --> 02:10:51.310]  And some of the emeritus, it's an organization that's got an emeritus, but other former and still current members include U.S.
[02:10:51.370 --> 02:10:58.975]  Attorney General William Barr, Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, Richard Donahue, former U.S.
[02:10:59.015 --> 02:10:59.635]  Attorney General
[02:11:00.459 --> 02:11:06.601]  FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Robert Mueller, James Comey, Eric Holder.
[02:11:06.621 --> 02:11:09.602]  So this is the top of the deep state?
[02:11:09.682 --> 02:11:10.582]  This is the pinnacle.
[02:11:10.702 --> 02:11:14.964]  Jack Smith is included in that group, who's running the indictments against President Trump.
[02:11:15.804 --> 02:11:28.748]  And what we did in the article, and when we were putting the article together, we tried to make it as simple as possible and gave a litmus test and tests to say that no matter who you are in the government,
[02:11:29.873 --> 02:11:37.179]  No matter what level, whatever agency, including President Trump, everything boils down to the council.
[02:11:37.479 --> 02:11:40.962]  And one of the things we gave was the assassination attempt of President Trump.
[02:11:41.763 --> 02:11:44.625]  So basically, who could have coordinated that?
[02:11:45.385 --> 02:11:47.407]  And who is now investigating that?
[02:11:48.068 --> 02:11:56.995]  So when you go up the pecking chain, you go to Secret Service, to the Department of Homeland Security, and then you end up with the council, the FBI.
[02:11:57.918 --> 02:12:04.364]  And if you go back to the testimony, we had Cheadle, who was insolently refused to answer questions for the Congress.
[02:12:04.804 --> 02:12:09.989]  Then we had Christopher Wray, who insolently refused to answer questions of the Congress.
[02:12:10.749 --> 02:12:16.554]  And when you go up to one more level and you say, well, who would investigate him or who would investigate Cheadle?
[02:12:17.235 --> 02:12:22.780]  You come to the council, you come to Inspector General Horowitz, and that's the pinnacle of the council.
[02:12:23.411 --> 02:12:36.381]  So, uh, I'm going to give you a, you know, give you a second, uh, you know, to ask any questions and, and send me, uh, I mean, I've read your report and I've read your report and it's dead on and you're highly recommended by the Trump campaign and you're a great guy.
[02:12:36.422 --> 02:12:42.787]  So we just want you to go through this because we, we already basically know this, but you've drilled in and getting the, you put the technicals together.
[02:12:42.807 --> 02:12:43.948]  So it's one thing to like,
[02:12:44.548 --> 02:12:44.848]  I don't know.
[02:13:07.406 --> 02:13:10.769]  That's exactly the reason we, you know, I authored the article and working with the people I'm working with.
[02:13:10.789 --> 02:13:13.631]  The reason we authored the article is, number one, to actually give people hope.
[02:13:32.754 --> 02:13:39.883]  What we don't want to do is we don't want people to feel they've worked very hard at making people feel like any efforts they make are futile.
[02:13:40.732 --> 02:13:41.733]  And that's not so.
[02:13:42.013 --> 02:13:50.040]  One of the things they do is they hide their relatively very small numbers with diversions.
[02:13:50.140 --> 02:14:03.110]  So when people say the deep state or they say the cabal, George Soros, aliens, Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, you know, they're always pointing to different people.
[02:14:03.230 --> 02:14:07.013]  But you're giving Trump a real blueprint of who to fire immediately.
[02:14:07.053 --> 02:14:07.734]  That's why they're scared.
[02:14:07.774 --> 02:14:07.914]  Yes.
[02:14:09.795 --> 02:14:14.637]  This is the people that run the country, and they do so through multiple means.
[02:14:15.557 --> 02:14:18.138]  But it's always historically the Praetorian Guard.
[02:14:18.198 --> 02:14:20.739]  It's always the guardians that turn bad.
[02:14:20.759 --> 02:14:21.739]  I mean, that's what this is.
[02:14:23.779 --> 02:14:25.320]  Well, that's a that's a great term.
[02:14:25.380 --> 02:14:26.540]  In fact, Tim uses that.
[02:14:26.620 --> 02:14:30.422]  Colonel Sindelar uses that all the time, where this is the Praetorian Guard.
[02:14:30.562 --> 02:14:34.303]  And it's great that you pop that out because it's exactly what they are.
[02:14:34.343 --> 02:14:37.844]  They're a Praetorian Guard that has turned against the public.
[02:14:38.570 --> 02:14:45.676]  And they do that through a political arm, an intelligence arm, an infiltration arm, a business arm, propaganda arm, and an entertainment arm.
[02:14:46.096 --> 02:14:55.503]  These are people that are very well organized, and they've been working on a plan that was actually formulated over 100 years ago, but fully implemented 50 years ago.
[02:14:55.523 --> 02:15:00.167]  And they have been working on one thing, and that is the extraction of wealth.
[02:15:00.836 --> 02:15:01.777]  from the United States.
[02:15:02.477 --> 02:15:05.940]  It really comes down to extraction of wealth.
[02:15:06.541 --> 02:15:12.266]  They look at us and they look at you, Alex, they look at me, they look at everyone in this audience as livestock.
[02:15:13.547 --> 02:15:14.187]  They really do.
[02:15:14.428 --> 02:15:20.813]  They look at us as stewards of a farm with positive and negative values.
[02:15:21.013 --> 02:15:23.395]  They don't see us as humans, as numbers.
[02:15:23.435 --> 02:15:25.717]  The good news is, when you elaborate, you're on target.
[02:15:25.757 --> 02:15:26.398]  You're totally right.
[02:15:27.608 --> 02:15:29.049]  We're the real Praetorian Guard.
[02:15:29.089 --> 02:15:30.429]  We're the real Praetorian Guard, though.
[02:15:30.449 --> 02:15:31.270]  That's the difference now.
[02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:32.710]  They know that now.
[02:15:32.831 --> 02:15:34.892]  Well, I think that's a great point.
[02:15:36.012 --> 02:15:41.375]  When Ben Franklin spoke about handing us a republic, he said, it's up to you to keep it.
[02:15:41.795 --> 02:15:43.656]  So it requires our participation.
[02:15:43.696 --> 02:15:52.160]  And the point of the article was to expose this relatively small group of people so that, to your point, Alex, the Praetorian Guard, the people,
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:54.341]  And that's why they're so scared.
[02:15:54.361 --> 02:15:55.161]  That's why they're so scared.
[02:16:22.372 --> 02:16:27.255]  They're scared to death of him because he does know, he does have a bead on who they are.
[02:16:27.455 --> 02:16:29.357]  They know he's got a bead on them.
[02:16:29.957 --> 02:16:32.519]  They've got him completely bracketed and surrounded.
[02:16:33.219 --> 02:16:43.546]  And they're, quite frankly, I think they're very, very concerned that once he gets in, if he gets in, that he will work to dismantle that organization.
[02:16:43.626 --> 02:16:46.928]  And he pledged last night with Elon Musk to obliterate the deep state.
[02:16:46.948 --> 02:16:47.969]  So let's elaborate on that.
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:50.543]  Obviously it was a deep state deal.
[02:16:50.623 --> 02:16:51.645]  They tried to kill him, they failed.
[02:16:51.985 --> 02:16:54.349]  How panicked are they right now that they failed to kill him?
[02:16:56.272 --> 02:16:58.873]  I wouldn't say that they panic about anything.
[02:16:59.313 --> 02:17:01.474]  These are cool cucumbers.
[02:17:01.894 --> 02:17:04.996]  They've been able to step around landmines that have blown up on them.
[02:17:05.796 --> 02:17:10.838]  This is a cool group of people, and they wield a tremendous amount of power.
[02:17:10.878 --> 02:17:12.739]  They wield the power of the FBI.
[02:17:12.779 --> 02:17:14.600]  They wield the power of the CIA.
[02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:19.642]  They wield the power of Congress and the Senate, people who are beholden to them.
[02:17:20.162 --> 02:17:22.583]  They wield a tremendous amount of power.
[02:17:23.223 --> 02:17:25.204]  But with that comes a downside.
[02:17:25.979 --> 02:17:40.809]  In wielding that power over the last 50 years, they've made their own enemies, and both on the left and the right, up and down, they have made a tremendous amount of enemies in the control of the population.
[02:17:41.389 --> 02:17:44.992]  And what you're showing on the screen there right now is the political arm.
[02:17:45.533 --> 02:17:50.517]  A lot of people think, most people think, that this group would report to the president.
[02:17:50.717 --> 02:17:53.940]  They think, well, Obama's in charge or, you know, Pelosi.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:54.260]  No, no.
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:56.482]  When the bureaucrats wanted Biden gone, he was gone.
[02:17:57.583 --> 02:17:57.983]  Correct.
[02:17:58.564 --> 02:18:00.706]  Well, the bottom line is the council wanted him gone.
[02:18:01.366 --> 02:18:05.810]  And what happens is the council does not work for the president.
[02:18:06.781 --> 02:18:10.723]  The presidents and the people that you're showing on the screen there work for them.
[02:18:10.743 --> 02:18:23.651]  And it's very timely, even though this article came out a few weeks ago, Jamie Raskin, who is listed on there and pictured there, who was the person who said the Congress will not allow President Trump to be seated.
[02:18:23.691 --> 02:18:25.252]  He said we'll have a civil war.
[02:18:26.266 --> 02:18:26.526]  Mm-hmm.
[02:18:26.927 --> 02:18:47.311]  And look at there, that picture was posted, you know, this article has been out for weeks now, and just if you watch the news over the past few weeks and you see who's speaking, you know, Grassley, Raskin, the people in the... No, I agree with your report, it's just watching it, you've identified who the enemy officers are.
[02:18:48.368 --> 02:19:07.484]  So what they do, and we've talked about, you know, the assassination attempt of President Trump, and I'm not, I'm actually not a conspiracy theorist, but when, you know, I believe my eyes, you know, when I see something like that, and I saw that 20-year-old, I'm going to say, that was somebody's son laying there in a pool of blood.
[02:19:08.374 --> 02:19:25.748]  And, you know, to characterize him as, you know, the shooter, the, you know, the deranged boy, you know, I looked at that picture and knowing what I know and looking at this, I said, he didn't get through an outer ring of security that was managed by Governor Shapiro, who was up for the VP slot.
[02:19:26.128 --> 02:19:27.609]  He didn't get through that outer ring.
[02:19:27.729 --> 02:19:31.012]  He didn't escape the FBI and the Secret Service surveillance.
[02:19:31.412 --> 02:19:33.173]  He didn't escape all that.
[02:19:33.373 --> 02:19:35.195]  Get up on a roof, on a ladder.
[02:19:35.695 --> 02:19:40.283]  With an AR-15 120 yards from the president without some help.
[02:19:41.004 --> 02:19:42.065]  Total protection.
[02:19:42.085 --> 02:19:44.429]  Even Congress is now agreeing with that.
[02:19:44.970 --> 02:19:47.334]  This was so obviously he was being protected.
[02:19:48.188 --> 02:20:10.137]  Well, and then the other thing I ask people to do all the time, and the things that I write in the books, you know, and the articles I put together, is people need to learn to trust their eyes and their ears, and not let somebody chew their food for them and tell them how it tastes, and not tell them what they're hearing and say, well, you're not seeing what you're seeing.
[02:20:11.018 --> 02:20:16.060]  People need to... So we saw a turtle stand down and the Secret Service head lying about it caught red-handed.
[02:20:17.284 --> 02:20:17.484]  Right.
[02:20:17.784 --> 02:20:20.505]  So, this is a, and I felt bad.
[02:20:20.545 --> 02:20:25.305]  My heart went out to this poor boy's father as, you know, he was manipulated.
[02:20:25.845 --> 02:20:27.706]  I don't think he was there acting alone.
[02:20:27.806 --> 02:20:28.586]  No, totally set up.
[02:20:28.626 --> 02:20:39.188]  And just from the audio, well, when you listen to the audio, you know, anybody who's done any amount of, you know, firing rifles and so forth, there's distinct rifles.
[02:20:39.588 --> 02:20:41.688]  You know, that wasn't one boy firing.
[02:20:41.748 --> 02:20:42.388]  That was a gunfight.
[02:20:42.408 --> 02:20:44.309]  No, you hear different, clear reports.
[02:20:44.629 --> 02:20:45.709]  You hear different reports.
[02:20:47.842 --> 02:20:54.627]  So no matter what your theory is, and Ray and Cheadle aren't forthcoming in terms of what happened, they've refused.
[02:20:55.287 --> 02:21:06.054]  to tell the Congress what was happening, and they refused to report to the people via their representatives to Congress, and that shows their contempt.
[02:21:06.595 --> 02:21:19.624]  But to say that there wasn't a gunfight there, there was AR-15 fire coming in, there was .30 caliber fire going out, there was .30 caliber fire coming in, and then they say, well, there was only one shooter.
[02:21:20.104 --> 02:21:22.265]  Well, who were they shooting at?
[02:21:23.621 --> 02:21:28.185]  You have to scratch your head and just listen to your own ears and believe your own eyes.
[02:21:28.865 --> 02:21:32.749]  And this is part of exposing the council for who they are.
[02:21:32.989 --> 02:21:42.657]  Because once people start listening and looking at the 2020 election and the upcoming election, they stole the 2020 election.
[02:21:42.897 --> 02:21:44.038]  You can see with your eyes.
[02:21:44.098 --> 02:21:44.959]  We have the evidence.
[02:21:45.439 --> 02:21:49.122]  It's a matter of judicial and public record.
[02:21:49.242 --> 02:21:50.003]  No, it's all come out.
[02:21:50.063 --> 02:21:51.064]  Illegals voted.
[02:21:51.224 --> 02:21:51.864]  Fake ballots.
[02:21:51.904 --> 02:21:52.405]  It's all come out.
[02:21:54.485 --> 02:22:07.134]  Well, they use a variety of means, but what they have projected in going into the next subject is, they may say, well, we're not in control, but who removed President Biden?
[02:22:08.555 --> 02:22:09.276]  Who removed him?
[02:22:09.436 --> 02:22:10.857]  Who did he report?
[02:22:10.897 --> 02:22:17.422]  He said, well, I'm turning our government over to my cabinet, or I'm turning it over to the bureaucracy.
[02:22:18.500 --> 02:22:20.022]  Well, who has the power to do that?
[02:22:20.042 --> 02:22:21.885]  Stop there, because that's the next point.
[02:22:22.325 --> 02:22:24.768]  Why did Pelosi come out and say she didn't leave the letter?
[02:22:25.209 --> 02:22:27.131]  Why is she disengaging herself?
[02:22:27.612 --> 02:22:29.654]  They're now admitting that it was a coup.
[02:22:29.795 --> 02:22:30.596]  What is the point of that?
[02:22:33.884 --> 02:22:34.725]  Absolutely.
[02:22:34.845 --> 02:22:37.787]  The point is, I think they're feeling bracketed.
[02:22:38.407 --> 02:22:40.248]  They'll never be desperate.
[02:22:40.508 --> 02:22:43.290]  These are smart people that have been doing this for a long time.
[02:22:43.810 --> 02:22:44.771]  Powerful people.
[02:22:45.391 --> 02:22:54.417]  But I would say that once they're exposed, my hope is this isn't Greg Stenstrom or any particular group against the world.
[02:22:55.197 --> 02:23:08.613]  By, you know, exposing them as enemies, the Congress can see them, the Senate can see them, the business people can see them, and all of the work that they've done to... No, exactly, they can't survive exposure so they want to get ahead of it like, oh, I admitted that, it's no big deal.
[02:23:10.106 --> 02:23:10.486]  Correct.
[02:23:10.967 --> 02:23:15.971]  So there was an attempted assassination on President Trump.
[02:23:16.151 --> 02:23:18.814]  They've removed President Biden.
[02:23:19.274 --> 02:23:23.238]  They projected Harris as the presumptive nominee.
[02:23:23.698 --> 02:23:34.128]  But what they really communicated, and this is something I wanted to bring out on the show, that people have to be prepared for, is they have every intent of stealing the election again on November 5th.
[02:23:35.515 --> 02:23:49.308]  No matter what the results are, no matter how many people turn out, no matter what the evidence is, no matter what your eyes and ears, you know, tell you, they're going to come out and say, President Harris won the election.
[02:23:50.490 --> 02:23:52.972]  They're going to do that on November 5th.
[02:23:53.072 --> 02:23:53.833]  I totally agree, sir.
[02:23:53.853 --> 02:23:54.734]  How do we counter that?
[02:23:56.485 --> 02:24:05.793]  Well, the counter of that is, you know, we've developed a plan and the plan is basically what they didn't have in 2020 is they didn't have an evidentiary base.
[02:24:06.554 --> 02:24:18.625]  You know, when people went to vote with their ballots, they were told that someone had already voted for them and then they couldn't vote or they gave them a provisional ballot, most of which aren't even counted.
[02:24:19.629 --> 02:24:27.511]  What we got is a lot of noise, a lot of clamor, a lot of anger on TV of people saying they weren't allowed to vote.
[02:24:27.571 --> 02:24:29.692]  What they didn't have is they didn't provide evidence.
[02:24:30.352 --> 02:24:38.935]  So what we're doing is we're going through and we're comparing mail-in ballot applications to whether they're qualified electors.
[02:24:39.535 --> 02:24:45.997]  During election day, anyone who's denied their right to vote, you know, we don't want anybody getting into a fistfight.
[02:24:46.557 --> 02:24:52.318]  And in the polling stations, what we want them to do is say, OK, I'll follow the law.
[02:24:52.458 --> 02:24:59.080]  You're telling me I have to file a provisional ballot, but I'm also going to file a police report, a call to have a report.
[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:01.820]  And there's a process that they'll be able to follow.
[02:25:01.840 --> 02:25:06.041]  They'll present that evidence going up the chain.
[02:25:06.701 --> 02:25:14.143]  And so we're going to have a ton of evidence and be able to say, well, this county, in order for them to certify the vote by December 10th,
[02:25:15.163 --> 02:25:17.123]  Then they have to be able to reconcile.
[02:25:17.143 --> 02:25:19.864]  They have to have adjudicated all police reports.
[02:25:19.924 --> 02:25:22.765]  They've got to have processed the provisional ballots.
[02:25:23.265 --> 02:25:24.385]  They must reconcile.
[02:25:24.605 --> 02:25:27.886]  If they don't do that, they can't certify the vote.
[02:25:27.906 --> 02:25:28.406]  Stay there.
[02:25:28.426 --> 02:25:28.726]  Stay there.
[02:25:28.746 --> 02:25:29.706]  We've got to take a break, sir.
[02:25:30.707 --> 02:25:32.707]  Greg... It's a good time to take a break.
[02:25:33.167 --> 02:25:33.487]  Thank you.
[02:25:33.907 --> 02:25:34.767]  Stay there.
[02:25:34.808 --> 02:25:36.388]  It's hard breaks with satellites.
[02:25:37.574 --> 02:25:40.437]  But what, going to break here in 20 seconds, but the point that you're saying is so key.
[02:25:41.318 --> 02:25:45.142]  The larger issue is they only have so many dead people, so many people out of district.
[02:25:45.462 --> 02:25:51.248]  They tried to kill Trump because they believe they can't override it, which the obvious then answer is they're going to do it again.
[02:25:51.868 --> 02:25:53.150]  The plane almost crashed.
[02:25:53.170 --> 02:25:54.471]  You saw it coming with an engine out.
[02:25:54.891 --> 02:25:56.773]  Trump is the type that doesn't make up a deal about things.
[02:25:56.793 --> 02:25:58.535]  I'm saying they're going to hit the airplane.
[02:25:58.915 --> 02:26:01.358]  It's like, folks, this is so do or die.
[02:26:01.818 --> 02:26:02.539]  This is so dangerous.
[02:26:02.559 --> 02:26:04.201]  They're going to make another go at President Trump.
[02:26:04.601 --> 02:26:05.542]  Greg, stay there.
[02:26:05.562 --> 02:26:10.447]  We're going to come back and ask you about that and then get into the council and your big report.
[02:26:10.467 --> 02:26:11.248]  I'll be able to find that.
[02:26:11.629 --> 02:26:12.910]  Stay with us back in a few minutes.

[02:27:24.093 --> 02:27:28.314]  Former naval officer, author, best-selling author, researcher Greg Stenstrom is our guest.
[02:27:28.354 --> 02:27:29.615]  Patriot.online.
[02:27:30.515 --> 02:27:34.176]  Amazing report on the council, the leadership of the deep state.
[02:27:34.797 --> 02:27:42.339]  So, get in all the points you want to make and more into the deep state, but, and, and, and what they're going to do, but obviously they already tried to kill Trump once.
[02:27:42.359 --> 02:27:45.260]  They're going to try again, but let's just start there and continue on.
[02:27:47.241 --> 02:27:51.222]  Well, looking at the, you know, to recap at the bottom of the hour is,
[02:27:52.049 --> 02:27:53.331]  Uh, for people are just joining.
[02:27:53.351 --> 02:27:54.773]  There's no deep state.
[02:27:55.053 --> 02:27:56.575]  There's no new world order.
[02:27:56.896 --> 02:27:57.717]  New society.
[02:27:57.817 --> 02:28:01.401]  As far as the council is concerned, there's only them.
[02:28:01.421 --> 02:28:02.623]  There's only their order.
[02:28:02.984 --> 02:28:06.188]  Everybody reports to them, and they have control over everybody.
[02:28:07.273 --> 02:28:13.617]  One of the downfalls or one of their vulnerabilities are whistleblowers, federal whistleblowers.
[02:28:14.517 --> 02:28:26.624]  So the city itself, the council and the inspector general was set up particularly to have federal whistleblowers, you know, report wrongdoing.
[02:28:26.644 --> 02:28:28.766]  So, you know, that was the whole purpose.
[02:28:28.806 --> 02:28:30.226]  We had problems with Watergate.
[02:28:30.306 --> 02:28:36.290]  We created the city and the council so that people would have someplace to go to report corruption.
[02:28:36.977 --> 02:28:51.749]  So they've been the sweet, generous organization for the last 50 years that people are supposed to report corruption and criminal acts, whether they occur in this country or outside our borders or any place in the government.
[02:28:52.509 --> 02:28:58.794]  And if you look at President Trump and you look at who he is, he's the greatest whistleblower in history.
[02:29:00.415 --> 02:29:04.178]  He walked among them, not with them, but among them.
[02:29:05.059 --> 02:29:06.160]  He knows who they are.
[02:29:06.863 --> 02:29:08.046]  He knows what they've done.
[02:29:08.828 --> 02:29:10.092]  He knows how they work.
[02:29:10.513 --> 02:29:11.676]  If he didn't, he does now.
[02:29:13.431 --> 02:29:19.656]  That is a huge threat to them because in concert with the Supreme Court, the U.S.
[02:29:19.716 --> 02:29:39.593]  Supreme Court and the House Judiciary Committee, they have remedies that they can take to suspend and terminate the actions of the council and break their hold on this country and their extraction of wealth and their basically their wielding of power through political people.
[02:29:40.339 --> 02:30:02.944]  So, if you look at Trump as the greatest whistleblower of all time, and he's coming in, then he would usher in hundreds of other federal whistleblowers that have been crushed financially, removed from their jobs, terminated, in some cases murdered for attempting to, you know, have good governance.
[02:30:03.785 --> 02:30:08.946]  And one of the things, the premises here is that, you know, public service really is the heart of America.
[02:30:10.017 --> 02:30:17.601]  Nobody joins the military or the FBI, the NSA, the TSA, name an organization, CIA.
[02:30:17.701 --> 02:30:25.144]  Nobody joins those government organizations to become a criminal or be beholden and work for criminals.
[02:30:25.765 --> 02:30:27.245]  They join for the public good.
[02:30:27.285 --> 02:30:33.948]  They join out of a sense of service, a sense of honor, a sense of country, you know, for their families, God.
[02:30:35.169 --> 02:30:39.231]  They join for all number of reasons to serve.
[02:30:40.231 --> 02:30:49.014]  And what this council has done is they've perverted that and they've made these people afraid to stand up with good reason.
[02:30:49.754 --> 02:30:57.377]  But I think once people realize what a small group of criminals this is and how they operate.
[02:30:58.132 --> 02:31:03.218]  That they'll be able to be thwarted, you know, in their their plans to extract wealth.
[02:31:03.778 --> 02:31:05.540]  We have FBI agents out there.
[02:31:05.580 --> 02:31:07.983]  We have people in the D.O.D., S.E.S.
[02:31:08.023 --> 02:31:09.825]  level, senior executive staff people.
[02:31:10.406 --> 02:31:13.789]  We have former deputies of organizations.
[02:31:13.849 --> 02:31:16.552]  We have people that are former members of the I.G.
[02:31:17.970 --> 02:31:23.393]  That have seen this in action and attempted to correct it, but they have no place to go.
[02:31:23.694 --> 02:31:33.340]  If you go to the political arm, which is described in the article, and they go to the Senate Oversight Committee, they run right into Chuck Grassley.
[02:31:33.976 --> 02:31:35.176]  He is of the council.
[02:31:35.356 --> 02:31:36.777]  They run into Jamie Raskin.
[02:31:37.317 --> 02:31:38.658]  He is of the council.
[02:31:38.898 --> 02:31:41.338]  They put them there and they've kept them there.
[02:31:42.179 --> 02:31:44.560]  So if they go to the Congress, they're stymied.
[02:31:44.600 --> 02:31:48.961]  If they go to the IG and they follow their chain of command, they lose their jobs.
[02:31:49.001 --> 02:31:50.302]  They lose their clearances.
[02:31:50.362 --> 02:31:51.942]  They lose their homes.
[02:31:52.582 --> 02:31:55.663]  So this is a this is a situation that needs to be remedied.
[02:31:55.683 --> 02:31:58.264]  And President Trump could remedy this.
[02:31:58.304 --> 02:32:03.286]  And this brings up a point that, you know, from a retaliation standpoint, anybody
[02:32:03.826 --> 02:32:09.068]  Who is an ally of, well, whether a President Trump or an ally for the truth.
[02:32:09.688 --> 02:32:15.190]  Anybody who speaks truth that could potentially expose them, they retaliate against.
[02:32:15.610 --> 02:32:17.370]  They retaliated against you, Alex.
[02:32:17.650 --> 02:32:24.052]  They retaliated against Roger Stone, General Flynn, Christina Baugh, Joe Hoft, Steve Bannon.
[02:32:24.072 --> 02:32:25.693]  Steve Bannon's sitting in jail right now.
[02:32:26.633 --> 02:32:27.433]  Peter Navarro.
[02:32:27.954 --> 02:32:32.075]  The list goes on where people who have tried to speak the truth
[02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:33.821]  Just the truth.
[02:32:35.081 --> 02:32:36.402]  And there is only information.
[02:32:36.422 --> 02:32:39.324]  There's no such thing as disinformation or misinformation.
[02:32:39.364 --> 02:32:40.805]  Well, I'm going to qualify that.
[02:32:41.246 --> 02:32:48.251]  Sure, it's a science that they use, but people should have the discernment to get all their information.
[02:32:48.291 --> 02:32:56.156]  It was the subject of Elon Musk's talk last night with President Trump and some of his interviews where he said, look, there's just, I need to put information out.
[02:32:56.276 --> 02:32:58.078]  Alex Jones, would you put out this information?
[02:32:58.098 --> 02:33:00.059]  Yeah, there's information and people can make their own decision.
[02:33:02.074 --> 02:33:02.655]  Absolutely.
[02:33:03.115 --> 02:33:06.319]  But when you do that, they retaliate.
[02:33:06.479 --> 02:33:09.803]  They've gone after you 10 different ways from Sunday.
[02:33:09.843 --> 02:33:11.204]  They went after Roger Stone.
[02:33:11.825 --> 02:33:17.812]  And by eviscerating, what they do is that strategy is called isolate, contain, and destroy.
[02:33:18.655 --> 02:33:23.779]  Their strategy, and to anybody who gets in their way, is isolate, contain, and destroy.
[02:33:24.219 --> 02:33:27.962]  I don't care if you're the President of the United States or the President of another country.
[02:33:28.002 --> 02:33:29.383]  No, I agree, and that's their admitted plan.
[02:33:29.403 --> 02:33:31.665]  They threw out the CIA, the FBI ran their attack on Maine.
[02:33:31.985 --> 02:33:34.507]  They even admitted they don't even hide it, because they're very arrogant.
[02:33:34.567 --> 02:33:37.009]  So, they can't be happy now.
[02:33:37.570 --> 02:33:41.913]  I know you're saying they've got ice water in their veins, but they can see the whole world's turning against them.
[02:33:41.953 --> 02:33:42.994]  They can't be pleased right now.
[02:33:45.006 --> 02:33:50.828]  No, I think that people, there's an awakening amongst a large part of the population.
[02:33:51.288 --> 02:33:54.649]  There's still part of the population that wants to keep their blue pill.
[02:33:55.269 --> 02:33:59.350]  They're building their own cages.
[02:33:59.811 --> 02:34:04.952]  People who haven't had any diversity, everything's going well for them.
[02:34:04.972 --> 02:34:10.414]  A big part of what I do is a matter of faith.
[02:34:11.172 --> 02:34:17.115]  And faith in God, and faith in Christ, and I do what I, you know, and actually faith in people.
[02:34:17.775 --> 02:34:19.156]  I have a lot of faith in people.
[02:34:19.956 --> 02:34:24.018]  And I think when people look at this, they can— By the way, interrupting, that's key.
[02:34:24.139 --> 02:34:26.039]  I've always said I'm betting on humanity.
[02:34:26.220 --> 02:34:29.541]  I believe people overall are going to be strong and don't want to be slaves.
[02:34:29.841 --> 02:34:30.882]  And I think we're seeing that happen.
[02:34:31.162 --> 02:34:32.803]  The global is to bet against humanity.
[02:34:34.582 --> 02:34:36.885]  Absolutely.
[02:34:37.406 --> 02:34:40.209]  That is absolutely on target.
[02:34:40.389 --> 02:34:45.535]  It's a very small group of people that spread a whole lot of evil around.
[02:34:45.675 --> 02:34:48.239]  But I believe that 90% of people agree in 80% of things.
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:35:01.374]  And, you know, in the writings and the things that we do and the election integrity efforts we've run, we take great pains not to denigrate Democrats.
[02:35:01.915 --> 02:35:05.198]  Because this isn't a Democrat-Republican problem.
[02:35:05.339 --> 02:35:06.861]  This is an American problem.
[02:35:07.461 --> 02:35:08.242]  We're good to go.
[02:35:22.645 --> 02:35:23.005]  Say again?
[02:35:23.245 --> 02:35:23.786]  Same group.
[02:35:24.306 --> 02:35:26.747]  I mean, at the top, it's not about Democrats.
[02:35:26.827 --> 02:35:33.571]  It's a uniparty, and they represent their own interests, and they don't necessarily represent theirs.
[02:35:34.352 --> 02:35:37.213]  There was a great case for this for the Democrats that are listening.
[02:35:37.714 --> 02:35:50.801]  I don't know how many are in your audience, but for the Democrats that are listening, after Hillary Clinton was installed, a group of people that were supporters of Bernie Sanders filed a case, and it was Wilding versus
[02:35:51.345 --> 02:35:53.766]  The DNC and Wasserman at the time.
[02:35:54.566 --> 02:36:00.308]  And what they did is, if you boil the case down, what the DNC said is, we can do whatever we want.
[02:36:00.989 --> 02:36:03.269]  It doesn't matter if Bernie Sanders won.
[02:36:03.690 --> 02:36:06.511]  If we want to install Hillary Clinton, we can.
[02:36:06.731 --> 02:36:09.832]  And back when they killed Seth Rich, that was up for debate, and that was true.
[02:36:10.292 --> 02:36:14.473]  Now they just totally put Biden in, get rid of him, put in Kamala.
[02:36:14.514 --> 02:36:15.434]  Now it's all out in the open.
[02:36:15.454 --> 02:36:18.255]  So isn't that the good news, as we force them out in the open?
[02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:23.915]  So you just made, you know, you're faster than me at making a point, Alex.
[02:36:24.455 --> 02:36:24.936]  Thank God.
[02:36:25.997 --> 02:36:32.404]  But what the Democrats need to look at here, and Republicans, they need to look at how they're being manipulated.
[02:36:32.784 --> 02:36:35.888]  Does any Democrat get a choice of Hillary Clinton?
[02:36:36.028 --> 02:36:36.228]  No.
[02:36:36.488 --> 02:36:39.331]  I mean, Bernie Sanders won the primary, not Hillary.
[02:36:39.972 --> 02:36:46.697]  Did anybody, did any Democrats get a say in the removal of Biden, who is effectively removed right now?
[02:36:47.097 --> 02:36:56.084]  Did anybody get a say in Kamala Harris and Walz being, you know, installed into the presumptive nominee?
[02:36:56.645 --> 02:37:00.367]  I mean, Governor, I don't know anyone who made a choice of Governor Walz, do you?
[02:37:01.268 --> 02:37:04.791]  And I think once people see that, they go, well, who's calling the shots on that?
[02:37:05.697 --> 02:37:06.498]  It's a unit party.
[02:37:07.159 --> 02:37:07.940]  It's the council.
[02:37:08.641 --> 02:37:13.988]  There are a small group of people calling the shots once you know who they are and you kind of accept that.
[02:37:14.509 --> 02:37:20.377]  Part of the cognitive dissonance people have is they can't believe that they're just going to steal the election.
[02:37:20.877 --> 02:37:27.201]  They can't believe that, you know, COVID could have possibly been meant to harm them.
[02:37:27.462 --> 02:37:30.083]  They go, I can't, I can't believe that our government would do that.
[02:37:30.524 --> 02:37:38.249]  Well, you saw prima facie evidence that they, whether they were involved in trying to murder President Trump and assassinate him.
[02:37:38.809 --> 02:37:45.693]  They certainly didn't do anything to stop it, so why is it such a hard leap to say that they'll steal an election?
[02:37:45.913 --> 02:37:54.397]  Why is it a hard leap to say that they would maybe develop a pandemic and a vaccine?
[02:37:54.437 --> 02:37:56.638]  So that's my next question, and people should read your report.
[02:37:56.678 --> 02:38:00.260]  The Council is running the United States of America, but let me ask you this then.
[02:38:01.301 --> 02:38:05.363]  Knowing the deep state, you're a great researcher on this, what are they going to do now?
[02:38:07.079 --> 02:38:09.920]  Well, they're going to continue to cement the control.
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:22.625]  If we had a 24-hour clock and looked at how close they are at complete state capture, we're at about the last three minutes of a 24-hour clock.
[02:38:22.645 --> 02:38:23.005]  I agree.
[02:38:24.073 --> 02:38:27.215]  They have subverted the entire government.
[02:38:27.775 --> 02:38:31.817]  They have subverted or captured our schools.
[02:38:31.997 --> 02:38:33.578]  They've captured our economy.
[02:38:34.219 --> 02:38:36.260]  They've captured our law enforcement.
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:37.961]  They've denigrated our churches.
[02:38:38.661 --> 02:38:42.203]  They've personally been behind, defund the police.
[02:38:42.743 --> 02:38:45.164]  They've been involved in opening the borders.
[02:38:46.185 --> 02:38:48.366]  And they're so confident because they think we don't know.
[02:38:48.426 --> 02:38:49.407]  Look at this video of these people.
[02:38:49.727 --> 02:38:50.567]  These are criminals.
[02:38:50.667 --> 02:38:52.068]  I mean, they all are all in on it.
[02:38:52.328 --> 02:38:53.129]  They think it's funny.
[02:38:54.144 --> 02:38:54.464]  They do.
[02:38:55.105 --> 02:38:56.506]  And there's an insolence to this.
[02:38:56.606 --> 02:39:08.417]  I mean, for people who have watched Kamala Harris or watched Joe Biden on TV, I think they take great pleasure in saying, hey, we can put in Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head.
[02:39:09.707 --> 02:39:11.269]  And there's nothing you can do about it.
[02:39:25.074 --> 02:39:28.895]  So that is the illusion of choice.
[02:39:29.035 --> 02:39:33.697]  Well, we're going to have an election, but we're not going to let you see how we count it.
[02:39:34.177 --> 02:39:35.478]  We're taking the election.
[02:39:35.958 --> 02:39:38.339]  They've centralized our elections, as an example.
[02:39:38.679 --> 02:39:40.460]  This is just one object of many.
[02:39:41.100 --> 02:39:46.522]  They've taken our elections, which were, we had 3,143 counties in the 50 states in the United States.
[02:39:46.542 --> 02:39:46.522]  3,143.
[02:39:46.622 --> 02:39:47.562]  Of that, it only takes 20.
[02:39:53.499 --> 02:39:55.520]  To change the entire national election.
[02:39:55.540 --> 02:39:56.421]  It's a math problem.
[02:39:57.102 --> 02:40:10.771]  I just needed to go to those 20 counties, install centralized counting centers with only a handful of people managing and counting the vote, remove the counting in Delaware County, as an example, where I live.
[02:40:11.191 --> 02:40:13.513]  We had over 3,000 people in 428 precincts counting the vote.
[02:40:13.533 --> 02:40:13.653]  Over 3,000.
[02:40:13.693 --> 02:40:14.174]  Now we have two.
[02:40:22.082 --> 02:40:30.546]  Two political operatives that have been installed that are saying, don't worry, we're counting your votes, and we're going to let you all know how it works out.
[02:40:31.327 --> 02:40:33.508]  So, by looking at different things for you.
[02:40:33.528 --> 02:40:34.969]  So it's Venezuela American style.
[02:40:35.549 --> 02:40:36.910]  So, so, you know.
[02:40:37.030 --> 02:40:37.530]  Absolutely.
[02:40:38.892 --> 02:40:41.294]  Venezuela, Philippines.
[02:40:41.314 --> 02:40:53.101]  The president or the CEO of Smartmatics has been implicated in malfeasance and corruption in Venezuela, here in the United States, and now the Philippines are bribing Philippine officials.
[02:40:53.281 --> 02:40:54.502]  Sure, so let me ask you this.
[02:40:54.542 --> 02:40:55.862]  You're big on countering this.
[02:40:56.343 --> 02:40:57.103]  Speak to that in a moment.
[02:40:57.323 --> 02:40:58.624]  Why do they hate Trump so much?
[02:41:03.427 --> 02:41:04.948]  Because he could bring them down.
[02:41:05.586 --> 02:41:12.802]  President Trump is really the solution here for whatever people may feel about him personally.
[02:41:13.746 --> 02:41:19.290]  The fact that he's walked among them and he's been to battle with them now for eight years.
[02:41:19.910 --> 02:41:23.653]  He's been at battle and war with them during his entire presidency.
[02:41:24.273 --> 02:41:28.236]  You know, we had every, every... And by the way, the war is 100% real.
[02:41:28.616 --> 02:41:29.257]  I experienced it.
[02:41:29.577 --> 02:41:30.658]  The hate is 100% real.
[02:41:30.678 --> 02:41:31.298]  He's not with them.
[02:41:31.618 --> 02:41:32.279]  That's why they hate him.
[02:41:32.299 --> 02:41:33.420]  He didn't go to their schools.
[02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:34.681]  He's not part of their club.
[02:41:34.721 --> 02:41:35.561]  He never ran for office.
[02:41:35.601 --> 02:41:39.244]  He comes in into the middle of it and they hate the fact that he made mistakes.
[02:41:39.304 --> 02:41:42.246]  Nobody's perfect, but they hate the fact that he really was the president.
[02:41:45.225 --> 02:41:52.767]  I think, on that matter, what can change things is we have a number of strategies we're implementing.
[02:41:52.787 --> 02:41:58.548]  You know, the counter strategy to isolate, contain, destroy is connect, engage, and restore.
[02:41:59.088 --> 02:42:13.951]  By connecting grassroots people together, you know, groups together, by engaging them, by doing this show right here, Alex, and engaging with people and explaining what's happening in our country, at least letting, you know, putting a hypothesis out that people can look at.
[02:42:14.691 --> 02:42:16.452]  What we're doing is we're connecting here.
[02:42:16.572 --> 02:42:20.273]  And President Trump, I think one of the big reasons they fear him is he's a connector.
[02:42:21.033 --> 02:42:24.975]  And he can communicate, he can talk for an hour to 100,000 people.
[02:42:25.155 --> 02:42:26.315]  Exactly, let me elaborate.
[02:42:26.335 --> 02:42:28.276]  There's an old internet saying, no one knows who said it, but...
[02:42:29.284 --> 02:42:32.186]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[02:42:32.546 --> 02:42:38.831]  They're not fighting like the devil to silence Trump last night and to silence you and me and put us all in prison if we didn't have a chance to win.
[02:42:38.871 --> 02:42:40.292]  We've got more than a chance.
[02:42:40.312 --> 02:42:42.193]  I think they've looked at the numbers and know he's going to win.
[02:42:42.473 --> 02:42:43.274]  He can override the fraud.
[02:42:43.314 --> 02:42:44.494]  That's why I go back to assassination.
[02:42:45.995 --> 02:42:46.196]  Right.
[02:42:46.456 --> 02:42:58.364]  But having said that, I want people, we have to prepare people that the council and their political arms, their intelligence arms and so forth, they're constantly running shaping operations
[02:42:58.843 --> 02:43:02.985]  And they tell you what they're going to do if you listen.
[02:43:03.405 --> 02:43:06.326]  They've told us they're going to steal the election.
[02:43:07.086 --> 02:43:10.448]  And what we have to do is we don't have to say, woe is me, what are we going to do?
[02:43:10.468 --> 02:43:13.529]  We have to say, OK, they're going to steal the election.
[02:43:14.309 --> 02:43:15.730]  What do we do?
[02:43:16.190 --> 02:43:20.371]  Does the election end on November 5th or 6th, whatever day they announce Harris won?
[02:43:20.711 --> 02:43:20.972]  No.
[02:43:21.752 --> 02:43:23.693]  The election goes until December 10th.
[02:43:24.798 --> 02:43:29.981]  Until they can certify and they must show that they ran a lawful election to certify.
[02:43:30.362 --> 02:43:35.105]  So just simply announcing it in the press that Harris won is insufficient.
[02:43:35.905 --> 02:43:37.766]  They have to be able to stop.
[02:43:37.946 --> 02:43:38.727]  That's right.
[02:43:38.787 --> 02:43:41.669]  Fox News can't announce on election night that they won.
[02:43:41.689 --> 02:43:42.890]  We need to be ahead of that.
[02:43:43.650 --> 02:43:49.478]  And that's the larger issue, is that Raskin, as you said, they always telegraph like we're idiots to their own people.
[02:43:50.019 --> 02:43:53.504]  He said on January 6th, we will decertify him under the 14th Amendment.
[02:43:53.904 --> 02:43:57.129]  So they're already believing they can't even override this landslide.
[02:43:58.362 --> 02:43:58.722]  Correct.
[02:43:58.922 --> 02:44:01.264]  That's the shaping operation.
[02:44:01.344 --> 02:44:08.129]  And while we're doing it, we're talking here on your show today to start that connection.
[02:44:08.290 --> 02:44:10.952]  We have Dan Bongino saying, vote early.
[02:44:10.992 --> 02:44:15.235]  We have Mike Lindell saying, well, bring your mail-in ballot down and surrender it.
[02:44:15.835 --> 02:44:20.319]  We have all different people with all disparate plans because they're disconnected.
[02:44:20.499 --> 02:44:21.520]  They've been isolated.
[02:44:22.140 --> 02:44:40.358]  Part of being on the show today is to talk about the council, but to connect these people and say, look, you know, for Dan Bongino, I think all of these people mean well, and they've got their hearts in the right place, but they don't understand the election, the mechanisms, the election and how fraud is implemented.
[02:44:40.958 --> 02:44:44.162]  So what they have to do is, you know, I'm not going to go into the plan.
[02:44:44.202 --> 02:44:45.363]  We only have a few minutes left.
[02:44:45.942 --> 02:44:55.237]  But they have to know that this is a plan and they have to know that we're going to challenge the vote this time or the results that they're going to announce.
[02:44:55.257 --> 02:44:57.640]  Talk about your analysis of how this should be challenged.
[02:44:58.905 --> 02:45:01.346]  Well, we have to show the evidence.
[02:45:01.386 --> 02:45:18.513]  So before, let's just say our county, which is I'm focused on in Delaware County with a group called the Deep Divers, and they're a group of concerned citizens, patriots, and they've gotten together and they've said, you know, we want to understand how these elections run and how we can help.
[02:45:19.294 --> 02:45:22.195]  So I'm going to use the election day as an example.
[02:45:23.183 --> 02:45:40.280]  When people come down to vote, and I do think Mike Lindell saying that they should bring their mail-in ballots, the in-person vote, it raises the level of difficulty for cheating if they show up and they don't know whether they're going to send the mail-in ballot in by mail or Dropbox.
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:41.121]  No, I totally agree.
[02:45:41.161 --> 02:45:43.784]  This conservative thing to vote early is a lie.
[02:45:44.517 --> 02:45:47.598]  I'm not saying Don Gino's wrong, but that's where they get them and can run their scams.
[02:45:47.819 --> 02:45:49.039]  He's wrong.
[02:45:49.199 --> 02:45:54.922]  I'm going to say that he's wrong, and I think hopefully he'll take it well, and I'll be happy to explain to him personally why he's wrong.
[02:45:55.642 --> 02:46:05.186]  But when you go to surrender your ballot, it's not going to be that easy, because the law says that if you haven't voted, they have to give you a real ballot and let you vote.
[02:46:05.627 --> 02:46:06.407]  Problem solved.
[02:46:07.253 --> 02:46:14.116]  But if they say someone's already voted for you and you're sitting there with your ballot and your ID and say, well, I don't know who that was.
[02:46:14.876 --> 02:46:19.998]  Well, I don't want people going on TV and whining about it and saying the vote was stolen.
[02:46:20.838 --> 02:46:30.802]  And what they have to do is we have to collect and we're going to collect the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of police reports and have reports.
[02:46:31.362 --> 02:46:35.664]  And we're going to document that these people, you know, were not allowed to vote.
[02:46:36.344 --> 02:46:38.226]  And there has to be a criminal act there.
[02:46:38.687 --> 02:46:40.589]  Somebody impersonated them.
[02:46:41.089 --> 02:46:42.911]  Somebody put in a ballot.
[02:46:43.452 --> 02:46:48.437]  That must be investigated and adjudicated before they can certify the vote.
[02:46:48.457 --> 02:46:53.302]  And you're right, we've already seen thousands of convictions since 2020 of people voting illegally.
[02:46:53.683 --> 02:46:55.505]  It's in the local news, never hits the national news.
[02:46:55.845 --> 02:46:56.386]  That's going on.
[02:46:57.250 --> 02:47:00.455]  I want to talk about, we only have a minute, but I want to mention the illegal aliens.
[02:47:00.516 --> 02:47:03.280]  And I think that it's a polarizing issue.
[02:47:04.162 --> 02:47:11.214]  And one of the things about illegal aliens is one of the last places an illegal alien is on election day is in a polling center.
[02:47:12.412 --> 02:47:19.997]  OK, they're not going to go in and commit a third degree felony that will get them deported permanently because they feel strongly about one candidate or the other.
[02:47:20.417 --> 02:47:21.698]  I'm not saying it doesn't happen.
[02:47:21.718 --> 02:47:22.399]  I think it will.
[02:47:22.879 --> 02:47:30.043]  But the reason they needed those illegal aliens on the voter registration, they've registered in a vote in Pennsylvania and other states.
[02:47:30.404 --> 02:47:31.905]  They said, well, come on, get a license.
[02:47:32.205 --> 02:47:34.947]  And when you get a license, you know, we're going to register your vote.
[02:47:35.987 --> 02:47:38.229]  The illegal aliens aren't the ones doing the voting.
[02:47:38.369 --> 02:47:39.990]  They're being voted for.
[02:47:40.757 --> 02:47:51.641]  And part of the process that they're trying to denigrate is that before anyone can get a mail-in ballot, by federal and state laws, is they must be a qualified elector.
[02:47:51.701 --> 02:47:57.764]  That means they must be a citizen and they must be a resident of the location they're voting in.
[02:47:58.044 --> 02:48:00.565]  That's before they can even get a mail-in ballot.
[02:48:01.207 --> 02:48:10.177]  So if the counties, corrupt counties and corrupt states and the DNC and the GOP are both responsible and culpable for this, they're ignoring that law and they're flouting that law.
[02:48:10.557 --> 02:48:15.202]  Now here in Delaware County and across the state, we're filing, we filed federal cases.
[02:48:16.043 --> 02:48:20.448]  Federal cases are put into place right now objecting to election machines that aren't certified,
[02:48:21.209 --> 02:48:24.371]  Objecting to mail-in ballots being illegally processed.
[02:48:24.771 --> 02:48:27.353]  Objecting to not cleaning the voter rolls.
[02:48:27.793 --> 02:48:29.054]  And they're all in motion.
[02:48:29.654 --> 02:48:30.695]  And we're doing these things.
[02:48:30.775 --> 02:48:34.838]  But the point here is the problem isn't illegal aliens.
[02:48:35.498 --> 02:48:38.580]  The problem is people that are voting for them.
[02:48:39.804 --> 02:48:46.149]  So that is what, once people can concentrate on that and say the issue is... Yeah, explain that, explain that, that's key.
[02:48:46.649 --> 02:48:57.056]  The Democrats bring them in, sign them up, use their name, give them a driver's license, and then that's done at these, like, 2,000 meal shows at these safe houses, where they then fill them out.
[02:48:57.396 --> 02:49:02.700]  Because what we caught them doing in Austin, it wasn't illegal aliens even doing it, they're just told, do this, you'll get your welfare.
[02:49:02.780 --> 02:49:05.002]  It's Democrat Party operatives, they're bundling these.
[02:49:07.011 --> 02:49:07.311]  They are.
[02:49:07.712 --> 02:49:10.615]  By law, an illegal alien can't vote.
[02:49:10.735 --> 02:49:13.719]  You can register your pet cat Fluffy to vote.
[02:49:13.739 --> 02:49:15.681]  You can register your pet Purtle.
[02:49:16.262 --> 02:49:20.287]  You can register any breathing being to vote.
[02:49:21.028 --> 02:49:23.711]  But that doesn't mean they get a ballot.
[02:49:23.751 --> 02:49:27.095]  That doesn't mean they get to be on a voter registration roll.
[02:49:27.759 --> 02:49:33.483]  They may be registered to vote, but when it comes down to election day, you have to be a citizen.
[02:49:34.003 --> 02:49:36.244]  You have to be a qualified elector and a resident.
[02:49:36.785 --> 02:49:44.750]  Now, we have multiple ways of challenging that, and we've been fighting, quite frankly, in corrupt courts, and not all of them are corrupt.
[02:49:45.210 --> 02:49:49.553]  What we're looking for is we're waiting and looking for an honest judge, and we're going to find one.
[02:49:50.154 --> 02:49:52.876]  And we're waiting and looking for an honest district attorney.
[02:49:53.316 --> 02:49:54.196]  And we're going to find one.
[02:49:54.216 --> 02:49:55.857]  We're going to find Jim Garrison.
[02:49:55.937 --> 02:50:04.042]  Did you notice, though, two weeks ago the FBI said there's going to be cyber attacks, but not on the integrity, on the voter roll checking.
[02:50:04.522 --> 02:50:14.128]  On the computers that check in the states, almost 30 that do it, they're saying, oh, the voter registration roll computers are going to go down so they can't check.
[02:50:16.823 --> 02:50:17.723]  They're telegraphing.
[02:50:17.763 --> 02:50:19.944]  This is what I said earlier when you read the article.
[02:50:20.324 --> 02:50:21.865]  They tell you what they're going to do.
[02:50:22.325 --> 02:50:24.886]  You just have to listen and then counter it.
[02:50:25.026 --> 02:50:26.167]  And I know we're coming to an end of time.
[02:50:26.187 --> 02:50:26.427]  Why do they?
[02:50:26.447 --> 02:50:26.727]  Why do they?
[02:50:26.747 --> 02:50:27.727]  We'll be five more minutes.
[02:50:27.767 --> 02:50:28.188]  We'll be back.
[02:50:28.928 --> 02:50:30.108]  But why do they telegraph?
[02:50:30.148 --> 02:50:31.949]  Is that to their own millions to feel confident?
[02:50:31.969 --> 02:50:34.230]  Or they just want to pre-share?
[02:50:34.310 --> 02:50:36.091]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:50:36.191 --> 02:50:39.252]  I always watch, like, old movies and, like, the villain monologues.
[02:50:39.292 --> 02:50:40.953]  Like, why would he monologue to actually do that?
[02:50:41.013 --> 02:50:42.573]  What is that about criminals?
[02:50:42.613 --> 02:50:44.154]  They love to tell you what they're going to do before they do it.
[02:50:46.836 --> 02:50:48.138]  I've heard multiple theories.
[02:50:48.158 --> 02:50:50.722]  I think part of it is the power.
[02:50:51.924 --> 02:50:54.849]  Rich people or powerful people don't play with things.
[02:50:55.149 --> 02:50:56.131]  They play with people.
[02:50:57.091 --> 02:51:05.455]  And I think that the simplest thing that people just need to hear is, you think this is about, you know, they are extracting wealth, but it's not just about the money.
[02:51:05.495 --> 02:51:06.995]  At some point you stop, they stop.
[02:51:07.015 --> 02:51:07.576]  It's about power.
[02:51:08.056 --> 02:51:11.137]  So at that point, they're power and they play with people.
[02:51:11.197 --> 02:51:25.383]  So whether that's narcissism, arrogance, karma, it could be attributed, you know, I hear all types of things that could be attributed to other supernatural events or supernatural beliefs where they have to tell people what they're doing before they hurt somebody.
[02:51:25.403 --> 02:51:26.104]  Exactly.
[02:51:26.844 --> 02:51:29.587]  It's a metaphysical rule.
[02:51:29.667 --> 02:51:30.108]  You nailed it.
[02:51:30.128 --> 02:51:30.869]  They have to tell you.
[02:51:32.659 --> 02:51:38.081]  Well, the bottom line is I think it's even simpler than that, and that is just to accept the fact that they do.
[02:51:39.001 --> 02:51:44.403]  So what I always ask people is if people say they want to... Hold on, stay there, stay there, stay there, sir.
[02:51:44.483 --> 02:51:45.184]  Believe me.
[02:51:45.224 --> 02:51:46.344]  Back in two minutes, we'll be right back.
[02:51:46.584 --> 02:51:52.306]  So number one, you've got central banks now starting to buy it, by the tons, right?
[02:51:52.446 --> 02:51:53.046]  It's a lot.
[02:51:53.707 --> 02:52:00.309]  You've now got Chinese citizens being encouraged to not just buy gold, but buy silver.
[02:52:01.010 --> 02:52:06.012]  Because China and Russia want to destroy the Western banks.
[02:52:06.552 --> 02:52:14.695]  And the Western banks, JPMorgan Chase and HSBC, have the largest number of naked short positions on the planet.
[02:52:15.561 --> 02:52:16.162]  On the planet.
[02:52:16.222 --> 02:52:23.327]  I think between the two of them, they have over 900 million ounces of silver in short position.
[02:52:23.367 --> 02:52:27.009]  Well, only 1.2 billion ounces of silver is mined every year globally.
[02:52:27.349 --> 02:52:31.052]  So they've got almost the entire annual production in a short position.
[02:52:31.592 --> 02:52:37.837]  That means when the price goes up, these banks lose money hand over fist in multiples.
[02:52:38.417 --> 02:52:47.768]  China knows this, which is why they're encouraging all of their citizens now to buy not just gold, but buy silver, because that creates more demand.
[02:52:48.129 --> 02:52:54.777]  Every time silver goes up in price, the Western banks lose money in multiples, because they're on the wrong side of the transaction.
[02:52:55.518 --> 02:52:59.500]  They want to do it to destroy the West and they want to do it to make a financial gain.
[02:52:59.941 --> 02:53:04.724]  Both of those in their minds are legitimate enough reasons to do something right.
[02:53:04.764 --> 02:53:11.067]  But let's look at silver because that's what we're allocated into right now because the ratio between gold and silver points towards silver.
[02:53:11.107 --> 02:53:11.928]  It's outperforming.
[02:53:12.708 --> 02:53:15.029]  Where were we just four years ago?
[02:53:16.110 --> 02:53:15.029]  1191.
[02:53:17.411 --> 02:53:24.755]  But now, since then, we've gone from 1191 to almost 30 in the last four years.
[02:53:25.195 --> 02:53:31.179]  See, the trend is accelerating because the geopolitical dynamics are causing its growth.
[02:53:31.559 --> 02:53:33.320]  It's not just a flight for safety.
[02:53:33.720 --> 02:53:38.423]  It's not just a way to preserve and protect your freedoms and get out of
[02:53:39.125 --> 02:53:48.787]  These unified ledgers and these social credit scoring systems and this digital money, you're getting something tangible that actually doesn't just grow.
[02:53:48.827 --> 02:53:49.748]  It's growing tremendously.
[02:53:49.788 --> 02:53:51.268]  It's up like 40% in four months.
[02:53:51.288 --> 02:53:52.008]  That's amazing.
[02:53:52.468 --> 02:53:55.549]  But you also have something that can maintain your freedoms, Alex.
[02:53:55.589 --> 02:54:00.490]  That's the tangible intangible, which is as our freedoms are eroded.
[02:54:00.510 --> 02:54:04.511]  I can't believe we have millions of viewers right now and maybe 500 people call you.
[02:54:05.031 --> 02:54:05.771]  It's a sponsor.
[02:54:05.791 --> 02:54:07.392]  I want to promote what I think is great.
[02:54:08.212 --> 02:54:14.777]  So, I sell water filtration systems that have the highest rating for, like, half the price on average, and I sell high-quality supplements.
[02:54:14.877 --> 02:54:16.218]  I just sell stuff that I think is great.
[02:54:16.778 --> 02:54:19.860]  Everybody should call you and get into silver and gold right now.
[02:54:20.240 --> 02:54:22.042]  There's nothing performing as good as it.
[02:54:22.582 --> 02:54:27.425]  I mean, it's like, it's like, it's on record it's the best investment, but the stockbrokers won't tell you that.
[02:54:27.645 --> 02:54:35.431]  The globalist argument is, oh, the world's in turmoil, and everything's collapsing, we gotta be strong, and America's gotta threaten Russia and China to keep us as a dollar.
[02:54:35.771 --> 02:54:37.752]  But they're the ones that undermine the currency.
[02:54:37.792 --> 02:54:40.433]  They're the ones that brought us into this situation.
[02:54:41.173 --> 02:54:43.153]  And so that's why this is so incredibly dangerous.
[02:54:43.173 --> 02:54:46.695]  They just tried to kill Trump just, what, 10, 11 days ago.
[02:54:47.095 --> 02:54:49.255]  They are going for broke.
[02:54:49.355 --> 02:54:50.636]  I wish we weren't in this position.
[02:54:51.136 --> 02:54:51.656]  But we are.
[02:54:51.756 --> 02:54:57.537]  But by admitting where we are, we have a real chance of waking up, like Congress saying, we know you tried to kill Trump.
[02:54:57.837 --> 02:55:00.318]  Buying silver is the smartest bet there is.
[02:55:00.338 --> 02:55:02.618]  If you'd have bought silver a year ago, up 20, 30%.
[02:55:02.898 --> 02:55:05.459]  That's what you want.
[02:55:05.579 --> 02:55:08.580]  And silver is the big mover in this economy.
[02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:12.760]  So, go now to KEPM.com forward slash gold, or 720-605-300.
[02:55:12.800 --> 02:55:14.781]  We'll explain it all to you.
[02:55:15.181 --> 02:55:19.182]  Most of the gold and silver companies are charging you huge 30, 40, 50% premiums
[02:55:21.222 --> 02:55:23.203]  And most of the conservative talk show hosts are doing it too.
[02:55:23.223 --> 02:55:25.464]  And I talked to a person, I said, you need Kirk Elliott.
[02:55:25.864 --> 02:55:29.346]  What does Goldman Sachs think gold is going to do before the end of the year?
[02:55:29.366 --> 02:55:31.087]  $2,700 an ounce.
[02:55:31.347 --> 02:55:37.930]  And I'm sitting here saying, it funds us, it keeps us on air, and it's the best investment hands down in an imperfect world.
[02:55:37.970 --> 02:55:43.072]  I mean, this is, to me, is one of the most important things to protect your financial future ever.
[02:55:43.232 --> 02:55:46.173]  Go now to KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:55:46.393 --> 02:55:47.754]  All right, final segment with our guest.
[02:55:48.274 --> 02:55:49.055]  Three weeks ago,
[02:55:50.208 --> 02:55:55.431]  I talked to Charlie Kirk, and he said, I got law enforcement sources that Biden collapsed in Vegas.
[02:55:55.451 --> 02:55:57.673]  They obviously didn't give him his speed, they gave him opiate or something.
[02:55:58.193 --> 02:56:01.215]  Then they fly him to Delaware for eight days to keep him under wraps.
[02:56:01.235 --> 02:56:02.095]  They put out a fake letter.
[02:56:02.135 --> 02:56:04.317]  Pelosi admits it's fake, as if she's not involved in it.
[02:56:04.757 --> 02:56:05.758]  That was a coup right there.
[02:56:05.778 --> 02:56:07.018]  It was a coup putting Biden in.
[02:56:07.619 --> 02:56:11.941]  So our guest, Greg Sindstrom, is absolutely on target.
[02:56:11.981 --> 02:56:13.082]  Patriot.online.
[02:56:13.442 --> 02:56:17.225]  His report, The Council, Who's Running the United States of America, is so critical, go read it.
[02:56:18.188 --> 02:56:19.489]  But we're already here.
[02:56:19.509 --> 02:56:20.790]  We're already in the ongoing coup.
[02:56:20.810 --> 02:56:21.871]  It's not like a coup is coming.
[02:56:22.211 --> 02:56:23.212]  They already tried to kill Trump.
[02:56:23.232 --> 02:56:23.873]  We're in the coup.
[02:56:24.373 --> 02:56:26.855]  So the question is, what are they going to pull now?
[02:56:28.016 --> 02:56:31.019]  People ask, well, how did Trump get in eight years ago?
[02:56:31.980 --> 02:56:33.141]  Because they underestimated.
[02:56:33.161 --> 02:56:35.062]  There wasn't enough dead people or folks out of district.
[02:56:35.503 --> 02:56:36.624]  They ran out of bullets.
[02:56:36.704 --> 02:56:37.825]  That's why they tried to kill Trump.
[02:56:38.445 --> 02:56:40.267]  So we're on the edge of oblivion here.
[02:56:40.587 --> 02:56:41.808]  It's quite a time to be alive.
[02:56:42.409 --> 02:56:44.050]  In the closing time, we have four minutes left.
[02:56:44.070 --> 02:56:44.611]  Finish up, Greg.
[02:56:45.683 --> 02:56:55.085]  I think this is, of all the times in history, this is the best time to be alive because it's a time of great choices and all the information at people's fingertips.
[02:56:55.905 --> 02:57:11.088]  And I think if, you know, God wanted to, you know, make sure that people were fully informed and making decisions between right and wrong and making decisions for their family and making decisions for their future, this is the best time in history to be alive.
[02:57:11.188 --> 02:57:12.948]  I wouldn't want it any differently.
[02:57:13.937 --> 02:57:25.566]  I think what we have to look at and people have to engage and participate and restore America, make, you know, MAGA, MAGA, you know, make America great.
[02:57:26.227 --> 02:57:36.195]  And the idea of American exceptionalism was, was, was, was a part of our fabric of our country long before President Trump.
[02:57:36.215 --> 02:57:41.619]  It's the fabric that President Trump grew up in and became wealthy and learned.
[02:57:41.639 --> 02:57:42.980]  It's manifest destiny.
[02:57:44.414 --> 02:57:50.404]  Yeah, American exceptionalism is something that we need to, is part of the restoration.
[02:57:50.645 --> 02:57:51.526]  And part of that is
[02:57:53.228 --> 02:57:59.970]  People need to feel empowered and engaged, and I'm telling, the reason I'm here today is, you are.
[02:58:00.411 --> 02:58:06.473]  The small group of people, the group of people we're fighting, is very, very small.
[02:58:07.313 --> 02:58:15.256]  You know, when they say the deep state, they make it seem so big that there's nothing you can do, that it's a matter of fate, and it's all in God's hands.
[02:58:15.316 --> 02:58:18.657]  Remember how they built up the former FBI director like he was God?
[02:58:18.677 --> 02:58:23.178]  And when we saw him, he was like a little man behind the curtain in Wizard of Oz.
[02:58:23.198 --> 02:58:23.798]  He was a joke.
[02:58:25.878 --> 02:58:28.439]  That's what we're dealing with, is we're dealing with the Wizard of Oz.
[02:58:28.479 --> 02:58:29.599]  That's a great analogy.
[02:58:29.739 --> 02:58:33.120]  Once people just take the blinders off, believe your own eyes.
[02:58:33.560 --> 02:58:35.080]  Believe your own ears.
[02:58:35.560 --> 02:58:36.921]  Listen to your show.
[02:58:36.941 --> 02:58:37.961]  Listen to other people.
[02:58:37.981 --> 02:58:41.442]  You know, I listen to, I like Roger Stone.
[02:58:41.462 --> 02:58:42.442]  He's one of the greatest
[02:58:43.102 --> 02:58:46.647]  Look at President Trump as someone he's done everything he could.
[02:59:01.306 --> 02:59:02.507]  He can't do anymore.
[02:59:02.747 --> 02:59:12.635]  I think that he may even secretly, he wouldn't say it, but I think he may realize that they're going to, you know, they're going to take the election from him again.
[02:59:12.655 --> 02:59:14.857]  And he's done all he could.
[02:59:15.017 --> 02:59:16.638]  It's time for us to do something.
[02:59:17.079 --> 02:59:20.361]  It's time for the American public to show up.
[02:59:20.482 --> 02:59:21.843]  That's what we're asking you to do.
[02:59:22.263 --> 02:59:27.868]  If you're sitting on the beach and taking selfies and pictures of what you had for lunch and pictures of your feet.
[02:59:28.208 --> 02:59:28.708]  You got a problem.
[02:59:31.192 --> 02:59:38.296]  Well, what you're doing is the devil will sit there and anybody, you know, the devil will make people's lives comfortable.
[02:59:38.877 --> 02:59:41.899]  The devil will jerk you off while he runs the clock out.
[02:59:43.620 --> 02:59:44.060]  Right.
[02:59:44.120 --> 02:59:49.744]  Everything's fine until that cage you've created for yourself, the door shuts.
[02:59:50.578 --> 02:59:51.119]  And that's it.
[02:59:51.379 --> 02:59:52.300]  The country's gone.
[02:59:52.480 --> 02:59:53.201]  We're at war.
[02:59:53.741 --> 02:59:56.704]  You know, you've, you know, your children have lost their lives.
[02:59:56.744 --> 02:59:58.626]  They've been denied an education.
[02:59:59.126 --> 03:00:05.993]  Your parent or your grandparents died alone in a hospital, you know, sitting in a mass and you couldn't get in the door.
[03:00:06.934 --> 03:00:11.278]  If you don't think we're in a fight and you don't think politics matter and you don't think we're at a war,
[03:00:12.170 --> 03:00:18.234]  Then be happy in your cage, and they'll shut it at some point, and then you won't be happy.
[03:00:18.394 --> 03:00:27.239]  But if it's so simple, and it is so simple, that if 90% of you show up, go to the poll and vote.
[03:00:27.659 --> 03:00:27.239]  90%.
[03:00:28.020 --> 03:00:28.780]  That's what we need.
[03:00:28.840 --> 03:00:30.001]  Right now, we only get 60%.
[03:00:30.101 --> 03:00:36.805]  Six out of ten people, and maybe it's only four out of ten because I think they're voting for the other two,
[03:00:37.782 --> 03:00:39.444]  But the bottom line is that 90% show up to vote.
[03:00:39.464 --> 03:00:41.105]  They can swing the election.
[03:00:41.125 --> 03:00:41.846]  They can't stop us.
[03:00:41.866 --> 03:00:42.647]  Greg, great job.
[03:00:43.027 --> 03:00:43.568]  Thank you, Greg.
[03:00:44.168 --> 03:00:48.112]  Alright, Maria Z, visiting from Australia, does a great job.
[03:00:48.132 --> 03:00:54.718]  She's coming in in just a few minutes, live, for the Balance of the Hour, ahead of Owen Schroyer, knocking it out of the park, 3 p.m.
[03:00:54.758 --> 03:00:56.060]  Central, The War Room.

[03:02:45.724 --> 03:02:47.906]  We cannot fight a war against another war without you.
[03:02:48.346 --> 03:02:52.230]  We bring you great products, so it's a win-win situation, but you have to make the decision.
[03:02:52.250 --> 03:02:54.792]  It's critical time to fund those at the tip of the spear.
[03:02:54.852 --> 03:02:55.933]  Thank you all for your support.
[03:02:56.373 --> 03:02:58.294]  Sign up for the free ammo giveaway.

[03:03:03.699 --> 03:03:05.220]  They're going to give an ammo away.
[03:03:07.079 --> 03:03:09.701]  You've seen what President Trump has gone through in the last eight years.
[03:03:35.726 --> 03:03:37.867]  And you've seen a lot of the things that InfoWars has gone through.
[03:03:37.887 --> 03:03:44.531]  And I want to thank all of you over the years for your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support, because without you, we would not be on the air.
[03:03:45.071 --> 03:04:01.921]  Now, without getting into a two-hour long story, in the process of the bankruptcy in the last two years, we were basically sabotaged, and the people that were brought in here to supposedly run things didn't reorder product, even though there was plenty of money at the time, to basically put this operation in a position of shutting down.
[03:04:02.541 --> 03:04:11.325]  But by the grace of God, years ago, I set up backup supplement line from one of the main providers of the raw materials we were using.
[03:04:11.785 --> 03:04:20.909]  And so many of these InfoWars MD products are actually our famous products, simply private labeled, and others are different formulas this company offers.
[03:04:21.249 --> 03:04:22.250]  They're all top of the line.
[03:04:22.290 --> 03:04:23.310]  They're already best sellers.
[03:04:23.610 --> 03:04:27.212]  They're already all over the market and in stores and online under other names.
[03:04:27.472 --> 03:04:29.073]  But they are all the very best.
[03:04:29.553 --> 03:04:31.634]  So this line is called InfoWars MD.
[03:04:32.666 --> 03:04:34.367]  Our supplements are basically all sold out.
[03:04:34.747 --> 03:04:38.388]  Only a few things are left, like X2, X3, and some of the other amazing products.
[03:04:38.808 --> 03:04:41.728]  But with InfoWars MD, you have Turmeric 95.
[03:04:41.868 --> 03:04:44.749]  That is the same formula as Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[03:04:45.129 --> 03:04:47.010]  You have the Nitric Boost.
[03:04:47.030 --> 03:04:48.770]  It's so good for your heart cardiovascular system.
[03:04:49.110 --> 03:04:51.231]  It is the exact same formula.
[03:04:51.511 --> 03:04:53.032]  So, our Nitric Boost is sold out.
[03:04:53.332 --> 03:04:54.532]  They have their Nitric Boost.
[03:04:54.812 --> 03:04:58.234]  They even let us use their name, Nitric Boost, a few years ago.
[03:04:58.274 --> 03:05:03.276]  So, they're the original makers of this that Dr. Mankiewicz and others have talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[03:05:03.716 --> 03:05:06.037]  So, these are all really amazing products.
[03:05:06.057 --> 03:05:12.140]  You want to check out the line of InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com and it funds our operation.
[03:05:12.760 --> 03:05:14.723]  Get great products and help keep us on the air.
[03:05:14.823 --> 03:05:16.045]  I need you to take action.
[03:05:16.325 --> 03:05:17.466]  You will love these products.
[03:05:17.707 --> 03:05:19.048]  They work really, really good.
[03:05:19.289 --> 03:05:29.301]  No matter which one you try, they're already top of the line, tested, private label by us, available right now at InfoWarsStore.com under the InfoWars MD label.
[03:05:29.502 --> 03:05:30.283]  Thank you for your support.
[03:05:30.603 --> 03:05:33.145]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:05:33.285 --> 03:05:39.429]  I'm your guest host, Maria Zee, and it's wonderful to be here with you all today.
[03:05:40.290 --> 03:05:42.952]  You know, these next few months are going to be difficult.
[03:05:42.992 --> 03:05:43.872]  That's no secret.
[03:05:44.172 --> 03:05:48.155]  There are going to be many, many different things that they throw at us.
[03:05:48.255 --> 03:05:51.698]  But I think one of the most crucial things
[03:05:52.478 --> 03:06:07.843]  In America right now is this culture war, this media war, this propaganda war that is happening, this fake support for Kamala Harris and Tampon Tim, and I just can't believe how many people are falling for it.
[03:06:08.723 --> 03:06:16.250]  But I do think that X has played a crucial role in exposing this for what it is.
[03:06:16.450 --> 03:06:24.978]  I think that people like my next guest have played a crucial role in exposing this, exposing the double standards, exposing the hypocrisy.
[03:06:25.378 --> 03:06:35.087]  This is absolutely vital in winning the hearts and minds of the people, not just in America, but all over the world, because this election is going to affect
[03:06:35.447 --> 03:06:36.329]  The entire world.
[03:06:36.389 --> 03:06:40.416]  So Bobby Sauce at TakeNaps on Instagram joins me now.
[03:06:40.496 --> 03:06:42.619]  Bobby, thank you so much for coming on today.
[03:06:43.749 --> 03:06:44.970]  My pleasure, glad to be back.
[03:06:45.390 --> 03:06:47.171]  It's good to have you back again.
[03:06:47.191 --> 03:06:54.016]  Well, I know you've been tracking this closely and you've had some really monumental shifts in your thinking.
[03:06:54.036 --> 03:06:57.919]  And this is something I really respect about you, by the way, because you're so transparent about it.
[03:06:58.960 --> 03:07:06.065]  But you've been tracking this propaganda and media war happening right now, this manufactured love for Kamala.
[03:07:06.105 --> 03:07:09.748]  I'd love to just get your thoughts on the past few weeks, really.
[03:07:11.055 --> 03:07:23.520]  Well, I just think that, you know, it's funny how, you know, if you look at the 2020 primary when Kamala Harris ran, she came in, I think it was fifth place of all the primary contenders in that race.
[03:07:23.900 --> 03:07:27.742]  And she didn't even get enough to make it to the first primary vote.
[03:07:28.002 --> 03:07:31.223]  She had a fundraising problem and a popularity problem.
[03:07:31.503 --> 03:07:40.147]  And even as early as three months ago, she was, I think she was, had an approval rating of the lowest vice president, I think of all time or since they've been tracking it.
[03:07:40.627 --> 03:08:01.009]  So, to think that she could go from being the least popular presidential candidate four years ago to now being supposedly somebody that has all this support is purely based on money and purely based on the fact that they can astroturf the campaign or astroturf the people and brainwash them into doing and saying basically whatever they want.
[03:08:01.409 --> 03:08:17.109]  And it really just goes to show how pervasive and powerful the media is, where if you can edit photos in just the right way and alter photos in just the right way and post just enough ads in just enough places and pay just enough influencers to help magnify your message,
[03:08:17.529 --> 03:08:25.378]  You can make it look like you're everywhere all at once, but I really just don't necessarily think that in every case the internet is the general population.
[03:08:25.698 --> 03:08:29.002]  So I think that this is a sugar high.
[03:08:29.803 --> 03:08:32.206]  I forget who said it like that, but I think it's a sugar high.
[03:08:32.912 --> 03:08:44.401]  Well, I want to, team, if you can bring up a couple of those shots of the aeroplane where you see, you clearly see in the reflection that the people that appear to be in that shot are not in that shot.
[03:08:45.482 --> 03:08:51.307]  It's pretty obvious to me, Bobby, I'm guessing these are the types of photos that you're talking about, although we do have more.
[03:08:51.727 --> 03:09:08.506]  And I think in that first, where the team's zooming right now, I can kind of see how maybe that, you know, that's a little bit higher, but as far as the engine reflection, which we're panning to right now, that's right in front of the crowd and there's no one there.
[03:09:09.588 --> 03:09:21.741]  Yeah, so I think that there's a really important, you know, something that I really always try to subscribe to is I try to only specifically talk about things that I can prove or at least come very close to proving.
[03:09:23.081 --> 03:09:31.945]  What I think a lot of people are mistaking is the difference between a Photoshop or edited photo, a digitally altered photo, and an AI-generated photo.
[03:09:32.225 --> 03:09:39.328]  Because there'll be videos and whatnot of individuals on the ground in these events saying, look, you know, Republicans and conservatives are freaking out.
[03:09:39.368 --> 03:09:40.289]  This was a real event.
[03:09:40.709 --> 03:09:44.310]  I'm not, I'm not concluding that these events are not real.
[03:09:44.650 --> 03:09:55.612]  What I'm suggesting is that at least some of the photos that they're putting out are at the very least digitally altered to enhance them and make the people look more enthusiastic or more densely populated.
[03:09:55.853 --> 03:10:06.475]  And then when you couple that in with the idea that you're going to pay influencers to elevate a message or pay influencers to maybe even show up at these events, which has been kind of proven more than enough times,
[03:10:06.895 --> 03:10:17.144]  If you add all of those things together and all of the media basically gaslighting you about what's been happening for the last four years and propping these people up, it makes perfect sense why it would look that way.
[03:10:17.184 --> 03:10:29.916]  But I'll look at a photo on Instagram and in three minutes you see a fake, faded image coming out of somebody's head holding a sign and it's like, I can't understand how any person could look at this and think that it's not real, but sadly they do.
[03:10:30.558 --> 03:10:37.301]  Yeah, there's another image team, if you can bring that other one up, where it's actually got some of the faces of the people in the crowd.
[03:10:41.582 --> 03:10:43.203]  I mean, really?
[03:10:44.943 --> 03:10:45.664]  Like, look at this.
[03:10:45.704 --> 03:10:47.885]  How many fingers does that man have?
[03:10:47.925 --> 03:10:49.085]  How many hands does he have?
[03:10:49.125 --> 03:10:50.285]  And this guy's eye.
[03:10:50.966 --> 03:10:51.986]  What is that face?
[03:10:52.006 --> 03:10:55.207]  I mean, maybe that's his face, but I don't know about those hands.
[03:10:56.408 --> 03:10:56.668]  Yeah.
[03:10:57.734 --> 03:10:58.554]  No, it's too funny.
[03:10:58.734 --> 03:11:07.637]  Cause that's the thing is that you, cause this is the thing is that you don't have to, you don't have to lie about everything, uh, you know, to be, to be manipulating people.
[03:11:07.937 --> 03:11:15.760]  So I don't care if you put out 75 images and then you put out one fake one where these, where the faces look like they're, uh, you know, they're goblins and ghouls.
[03:11:16.080 --> 03:11:18.361]  If you'll put out one, that means you'll put out a thousand.
[03:11:18.581 --> 03:11:20.862]  If you lie about anything, you'll lie about everything.
[03:11:21.122 --> 03:11:25.343]  And we already know that they lie, but it's just so funny watching these, like,
[03:11:25.583 --> 03:11:25.883]  I don't know.
[03:11:41.413 --> 03:11:46.417]  I agree with you, but on a much more serious note, Bobby, you make such a vital point here.
[03:11:46.437 --> 03:11:49.199]  If you'll lie even about one photo, you'll lie about anything.
[03:11:49.860 --> 03:11:53.723]  And the problem that we have is that now, you know, we have governments around the world.
[03:11:53.763 --> 03:11:54.944]  This is why I highlighted this.
[03:11:54.964 --> 03:11:55.325]  People said,
[03:11:55.725 --> 03:11:57.506]  I'm getting distracted by the political theatre.
[03:11:57.566 --> 03:12:06.032]  No, actually, this is vital because governments around the world are regulating the use of AI so that we can't use it to benefit us.
[03:12:06.413 --> 03:12:12.177]  Meanwhile, you have video editing or photo editing tools or AI being used.
[03:12:12.637 --> 03:12:16.441]  Essentially, this is, in my opinion, this is election interference.
[03:12:16.481 --> 03:12:18.203]  You're manufacturing support.
[03:12:18.243 --> 03:12:19.224]  It's not really there.
[03:12:19.264 --> 03:12:24.069]  I mean, surely there's some sort of at least code of ethics against this.
[03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:32.418]  And it's just a shadow of the types of ways in which governments will use or are already using the digital world against us.
[03:12:34.332 --> 03:12:44.081]  Yeah, I think I saw a video just a couple days ago that showed a side-by-side of a real video of a person and a completely AI-generated person in video format.
[03:12:44.401 --> 03:12:51.007]  And it's like we've basically reached the point where consumer AI is indiscernible from real video.
[03:12:51.367 --> 03:12:55.431]  So to think that they're doing this even on the littlest level
[03:12:55.911 --> 03:12:58.232]  It's like almost unfathomable to think that they are.
[03:12:58.272 --> 03:13:08.595]  It's like if these people will literally lie to you about everything right to your face and tell you things that, you know, your average rational human being, you don't even have to be conservative or right-wing or whatever.
[03:13:08.795 --> 03:13:12.356]  You're just like, yeah, you can't, you know, you can't cut off your pen 15 and be a girl.
[03:13:12.396 --> 03:13:13.637]  That's not how that works.
[03:13:13.657 --> 03:13:14.337]  You can't do that.
[03:13:14.657 --> 03:13:28.945]  So it's like, if they will lie about these things that are provably obvious right in your face, it's like, you honestly think that somebody that got $100 million in one day in donations to their campaign and has the support of all these major companies, who's the largest Democrat donor?
[03:13:29.165 --> 03:13:31.706]  I'm pretty sure, or corporate donor, I'm pretty sure it was Google.
[03:13:32.267 --> 03:13:35.808]  Who has the most sophisticated AI probably in the history of the world?
[03:13:37.189 --> 03:13:38.029]  Probably Google.
[03:13:38.089 --> 03:13:44.692]  So just to think that we're, if we could identify it on Instagram in 10 seconds, can you imagine what they're actually capable of?
[03:13:45.072 --> 03:13:45.852]  Yeah, I agree.
[03:13:45.952 --> 03:13:53.735]  Although, you know, having the most powerful AI and you're still making images where the eyes are kind of going like this is pretty hilarious.
[03:13:55.575 --> 03:13:57.556]  I want to talk about some of that gaslighting team.
[03:13:57.796 --> 03:14:04.918]  Alex had a video earlier of Gavin Newsom where a reporter says, oh, my energy costs aren't going down.
[03:14:04.999 --> 03:14:06.319]  And Gavin Newsom goes, oh,
[03:14:06.799 --> 03:14:07.440]  Yes, they are.
[03:14:07.741 --> 03:14:09.162]  Can you please play that?
[03:14:09.302 --> 03:14:13.107]  I live in Woodland and I'm actually a customer of Valley Clean Energy.
[03:14:13.808 --> 03:14:16.251]  And I can tell you my power bills have not gone down.
[03:14:16.271 --> 03:14:23.820]  And I'm curious, when should California see some financial benefit to this transformation to renewables?
[03:14:24.021 --> 03:14:24.962]  Well, I think we have.
[03:14:26.519 --> 03:14:32.003]  That wind, water and solar has kept prices down.
[03:14:32.184 --> 03:14:35.226]  This is the cheapest form of energy right out here, this technology.
[03:14:35.806 --> 03:14:38.868]  It's had a significant impact on what you don't see.
[03:14:40.269 --> 03:14:41.950]  Our nation-leading climate policies
[03:14:42.811 --> 03:14:51.417]  I've also had a significant impact of rebating customers, including $146 just this month that will be going out on average to customers.
[03:14:51.797 --> 03:14:54.719]  Millions and millions of customers through our cap and trade program.
[03:14:54.799 --> 03:14:55.480]  All right, that's enough.
[03:14:55.540 --> 03:14:56.020]  That's enough.
[03:14:56.160 --> 03:14:57.781]  I can't handle this guy.
[03:14:58.401 --> 03:15:02.464]  And you know, we laugh because it is hilarious at just how blatant this is.
[03:15:03.025 --> 03:15:05.026]  But Bobby, look how serious this is.
[03:15:05.066 --> 03:15:10.670]  Someone is actually saying, I can tell you, I'm looking at my bills and my bills are not going down.
[03:15:11.070 --> 03:15:12.351]  And he's like, oh, yes, they are.
[03:15:13.032 --> 03:15:15.278]  Oh, sorry, my mistake.
[03:15:15.379 --> 03:15:16.843]  What's your response supposed to be there?
[03:15:18.038 --> 03:15:18.759]  Right, exactly.
[03:15:18.819 --> 03:15:26.844]  Well, that is where somebody like a Gavin Newsom serpent, as I would refer to him as, really is the biggest threat.
[03:15:26.944 --> 03:15:32.228]  Because you get a lie that comes from Joe Biden, and it's like, this guy isn't really too sharp.
[03:15:32.568 --> 03:15:36.330]  But you get a person like him who will blatantly lie directly to your face.
[03:15:36.370 --> 03:15:41.254]  Like when he did that debate with Ron DeSantis, they were like, here's the chart from the Department of Labor.
[03:15:41.314 --> 03:15:42.495]  It shows this specific thing.
[03:15:42.515 --> 03:15:42.755]  He's like,
[03:15:43.275 --> 03:15:43.875]  No, it doesn't.
[03:15:44.175 --> 03:15:45.996]  But herein lies the real problem.
[03:15:46.276 --> 03:15:51.557]  I don't blame these slithering serpent demon politicians like Gavin Newsom for lying to us.
[03:15:51.857 --> 03:16:02.640]  What I blame is the average American citizen for being so stupid, or smooth-brained as I would refer to them as, for literally letting them lie directly to your face and being like, he's handsome!
[03:16:03.760 --> 03:16:09.962]  He's cleaning up California because there's 15 pictures of him picking up a bag of garbage from some
[03:16:10.282 --> 03:16:10.643]  We're good.
[03:16:23.892 --> 03:16:29.315]  Because they know that it's true, and any rational, intelligent person knows, they just don't care.
[03:16:29.575 --> 03:16:31.236]  So in some cases, it's stupidity.
[03:16:31.496 --> 03:16:35.419]  In other cases, they're just like, well, the other guy is an orange tyrant.
[03:16:35.899 --> 03:16:41.262]  So you're willing to let this slithering demon lie straight to your face because you don't like the other guy.
[03:16:41.602 --> 03:16:44.224]  It's just like, you're a communist.
[03:16:44.324 --> 03:16:45.424]  You don't care about the country.
[03:16:45.444 --> 03:16:50.947]  And really, what you really don't care about is yourself, your freedom, and the freedom of the children and the next generation.
[03:16:50.967 --> 03:16:51.908]  So you're selfish.
[03:16:52.408 --> 03:16:56.134]  And sad inside, empowered by soy, as I usually say.
[03:16:57.298 --> 03:16:58.519]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[03:16:58.539 --> 03:17:05.202]  You know, they even have, there's a video of Whoopi Goldberg saying, I don't care if he poops his pants, anyone but Trump, essentially.
[03:17:06.423 --> 03:17:16.728]  And, you know, there are people that are genuinely just driven by so much hatred for Trump for whatever reason is, because they read CNN headlines.
[03:17:17.869 --> 03:17:23.472]  And so it just doesn't matter how poorly their own party treats them.
[03:17:24.505 --> 03:17:36.110]  Who's giving them a presidential candidate that they didn't vote for, who's lying, stealing the other candidates' policies, lying and saying, oh, once I'm in, I'm going to do this.
[03:17:36.170 --> 03:17:38.191]  It's like you're the vice president now.
[03:17:38.331 --> 03:17:43.274]  You're pretty close to Biden, right, being his VP.
[03:17:43.314 --> 03:17:44.814]  You could probably do some of this now.
[03:17:45.234 --> 03:17:50.977]  I mean, how insulting is this to the intelligence of the Democratic voters?
[03:17:51.557 --> 03:17:52.578]  I'm amazed by this.
[03:17:53.752 --> 03:18:01.534]  Yeah, it's incredibly insulting, but it's kind of like, it's, you know, it's kind of a, um, it's cliche, but it's, it's like the frog in boiling water.
[03:18:01.574 --> 03:18:10.537]  It's like, imagine if we could run a candidate that nobody voted for, that has no stated policy positions, and then just not have them speak.
[03:18:11.137 --> 03:18:14.398]  It's like, if we could do that, we could pretty much do anything.
[03:18:14.418 --> 03:18:20.940]  And it's like, honestly, I would not be surprised if like in 2028, they literally just have an AI generated
[03:18:21.440 --> 03:18:23.442]  Fake, non-real person running.
[03:18:23.762 --> 03:18:25.564]  And it's like, she's so brave!
[03:18:25.684 --> 03:18:33.150]  They can make it be like, trans, a woman, a they-them, six races at the same time, and it literally could be a figment of our imagination.
[03:18:33.431 --> 03:18:44.660]  But that's the real problem, is just like, they are moving the window of what is acceptable and accepted by their voters to such a degree that it's like, do you have no
[03:18:45.928 --> 03:18:47.349]  Concern at all?
[03:18:47.369 --> 03:18:50.272]  Like, you literally don't even know what she wants to do.
[03:18:50.332 --> 03:18:51.833]  It's not even written down.
[03:18:52.073 --> 03:18:55.676]  Not only is it not written down, she's not even saying it, and they really don't care.
[03:18:55.696 --> 03:18:59.959]  And it just goes to show, like you said about Whoopi, it's like they say the quiet part out loud.
[03:18:59.979 --> 03:19:06.705]  It's like, I don't care if he poops his pants, if he's a vegetable, if he's in a dumpster, you know, at the bottom of the sea, I'm voting Biden.
[03:19:06.745 --> 03:19:06.965]  It's like,
[03:19:07.305 --> 03:19:09.146]  You're sick in the brain, dude.
[03:19:09.326 --> 03:19:10.386]  I like Donnie.
[03:19:10.606 --> 03:19:11.807]  I certainly don't think he's perfect.
[03:19:11.847 --> 03:19:12.947]  He's obviously better than you.
[03:19:13.227 --> 03:19:16.548]  But I wouldn't vote for him if he was waist deep and dumb.
[03:19:16.608 --> 03:19:17.649]  What are you talking about?
[03:19:18.029 --> 03:19:19.229]  You're a psycho person.
[03:19:19.489 --> 03:19:20.570]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:19:20.790 --> 03:19:27.652]  And by the same token, Bobby, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I obviously, I'm an Australian, but my
[03:19:27.972 --> 03:19:32.435]  Thinking and my politics is more on the right or Republican side, okay?
[03:19:32.455 --> 03:19:48.187]  But if it was another candidate, other than Donald Trump, and they were absolutely, you know, as pathetic and lacking a command of the English language as Kamala Harris, I would be saying, okay, we need a better candidate.
[03:19:48.447 --> 03:19:50.210]  You know, I don't like Kamala.
[03:19:50.350 --> 03:19:51.452]  I think she's terrible.
[03:19:52.293 --> 03:19:54.336]  But this candidate's no good either.
[03:19:54.376 --> 03:19:55.538]  Let's get a better person.
[03:19:55.578 --> 03:19:58.383]  But that just doesn't happen with the left.
[03:19:59.744 --> 03:20:05.630]  Yeah, I mean, even if they just had some type of snap vote, I don't know.
[03:20:05.810 --> 03:20:08.973]  I don't know the protocol for it, but there has to be one.
[03:20:09.273 --> 03:20:16.780]  And the fact that people are just so willing to jump behind somebody that literally nobody voted for just seems so unfathomable to me.
[03:20:17.100 --> 03:20:23.146]  And it's like, I honestly think that it sets a really creepy and peculiar precedent for the future of the left.
[03:20:24.447 --> 03:20:27.531]  The left, like the right is ultimately like the left going the speed limit.
[03:20:27.551 --> 03:20:36.080]  So it's like, will this happen with us at some point where, where our candidate is just spoon fed to us where maybe there is no primary and it's always picked by delegates.
[03:20:36.100 --> 03:20:37.321]  Does this set that precedent?
[03:20:37.622 --> 03:20:43.068]  Because I really, as much as I know that the right is better, the conservative party is better or whatever, it's like,
[03:20:43.468 --> 03:20:45.770]  They do lots of terrible stuff to us.
[03:20:45.810 --> 03:20:49.152]  Like you're telling me Lindsey Graham is fighting on our behalf.
[03:20:49.412 --> 03:20:53.435]  You're telling me, you know, Adam Kinzinger and all these other serpents are in there fighting.
[03:20:53.455 --> 03:20:55.696]  So it's like, we tolerate a lot as well.
[03:20:55.736 --> 03:20:58.338]  And I understand it to a degree, but like,
[03:20:59.033 --> 03:21:11.055]  This is likely, I hate to say it, what is next for us if we don't make the same type of stink about holding Donnie or whomever we vote for accountable for literally everything.
[03:21:11.276 --> 03:21:23.298]  Cuz with each thing that we don't hold people accountable for, or at the very least are afraid to talk or speak out about, the further they're gonna get from caring what we say or what we talk about that they're doing.
[03:21:23.618 --> 03:21:24.559]  That's such a good point.
[03:21:24.839 --> 03:21:34.907]  And I think, you know, I want to talk to you about this on the other side of the break because I'm hearing, you know, some people on the right and they have a very, very good point.
[03:21:34.967 --> 03:21:37.970]  They're talking about it on X and they're saying, you know, Democrats are very unified.
[03:21:38.010 --> 03:21:41.212]  They just pretend like everything in their party is perfect.
[03:21:41.272 --> 03:21:45.356]  They don't openly air their dirty laundry, whereas conservatives
[03:21:45.896 --> 03:21:52.961]  We'll go out and make viral posts that the left then uses against them and we need to stop doing that and be unified and so on and so forth.
[03:21:52.981 --> 03:22:00.686]  And to an extent I understand that because of how vicious the left is and they don't respect
[03:22:01.226 --> 03:22:04.348]  Just being honest and transparent and holding the people that you love to account.
[03:22:04.428 --> 03:22:06.609]  Like, they don't have that concept.
[03:22:06.629 --> 03:22:18.615]  It's a dog-eat-dog world and, you know, everything's fine as long as Trump doesn't get in and we'll just, you know, gloss over the fact that, you know, Stolen Valor tampon Tim is not the best guy.
[03:22:20.396 --> 03:22:38.048]  You know, it's insane to me, but at the same time, you know, it's like, do we then give up on the fact that actually the right is represented, I should say, by independent thinkers and people that aren't afraid to hold people to account and say, hey, we demand better accountability.
[03:22:38.068 --> 03:22:39.509]  And I think that ties in really well.
[03:22:40.169 --> 03:22:41.310]  To what you're saying here.
[03:22:41.370 --> 03:22:43.470]  So on the other side of the break, we're going to talk about that.
[03:22:43.490 --> 03:22:48.052]  We're going to talk about Tim Walz and the Stolen Valor saga.
[03:22:48.593 --> 03:22:51.254]  And we're going to talk more about the culture.
[03:22:51.514 --> 03:22:58.597]  Candace Owens' commentary recently about, you know, oh, well, just every black person's just, yeah, we all just like to twerk.
[03:22:58.657 --> 03:23:01.138]  I mean, this is just so offensive, so offensive.
[03:23:01.318 --> 03:23:06.440]  As an outsider, as an insider, you should be offended at the Democratic Party.
[03:23:06.900 --> 03:23:10.228]  So don't go anywhere, we'll be back here with Bobby Sauce.
[03:23:10.268 --> 03:23:12.734]  You can find him on IG at TakeNaps.
[03:23:13.271 --> 03:23:15.353]  The InfoWars system is very simple.
[03:23:15.553 --> 03:23:20.116]  We tell you the truth about what's going on in the world, and we ask that you support us in exchange.
[03:23:20.256 --> 03:23:23.159]  If we don't tell you the truth, you probably won't support us.
[03:23:23.499 --> 03:23:24.700]  That's our only incentive.
[03:23:24.840 --> 03:23:27.342]  All we have is you, the InfoWars audience.
[03:23:27.882 --> 03:23:35.848]  And just like our information has to be good, or else we can't expect your support, well, our products have to be good, or we can't expect you to be returning customers.
[03:23:35.868 --> 03:23:39.711]  And everybody knows some of the bombshell, incredible, iconic
[03:23:40.812 --> 03:23:41.613]  We're good to go.
[03:24:03.524 --> 03:24:03.804]  We're good.
[03:24:13.151 --> 03:24:16.054]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:16.534 --> 03:24:26.864]  Terry Breton, I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly, the weak little man who sent the letter to Elon Musk saying, don't you dare interview Donald Trump.
[03:24:26.904 --> 03:24:29.207]  It's going to be full of disinformation.
[03:24:29.307 --> 03:24:31.869]  The world's going to implode or explode.
[03:24:32.770 --> 03:24:36.093]  And just watching the left's reaction to
[03:24:37.975 --> 03:24:52.493]  Two men having a conversation has just been fascinating to me and so I want to talk to you about that in a moment Bobby but let me just say to the viewers as and I can say this as an outsider coming here you are tuned in to
[03:24:53.374 --> 03:25:00.798]  The most, the most, one of the most, but I would say the most prolific media outlets in the world right now.
[03:25:01.519 --> 03:25:13.386]  This entire team, this entire studio, the professionalism of these people, the genuine care for humanity that every single person I've encountered inside the InfoWars crew
[03:25:13.966 --> 03:25:17.747]  And these studios is is you you cannot believe it.
[03:25:18.047 --> 03:25:20.968]  It's it's the best I've seen in the industry.
[03:25:21.028 --> 03:25:23.309]  So please continue to support InfoWars.
[03:25:23.749 --> 03:25:26.830]  Get yourself some really, really great products.
[03:25:27.490 --> 03:25:35.692]  I myself have plugged Brainforce Ultra myself because I use that in Australia when I'm getting up early hours of the morning to do broadcasts in the US.
[03:25:35.732 --> 03:25:37.372]  And so I highly recommend it.
[03:25:38.113 --> 03:25:39.673]  But their products are fantastic.
[03:25:39.753 --> 03:25:40.854]  Thank you very much.
[03:25:56.710 --> 03:26:00.052]  Over a million people were listening live because they were able to get in.
[03:26:00.112 --> 03:26:07.617]  They were able to get the information to the world when there was a DDoS attack and others weren't able to access it.
[03:26:07.637 --> 03:26:09.738]  So please continue to support InfoWars.
[03:26:10.719 --> 03:26:14.561]  I have to say that because I value this place so much, so, so much.
[03:26:15.321 --> 03:26:20.665]  Bobby, the absolute lunacy, the overreaction
[03:26:21.445 --> 03:26:26.935]  Of these two men having a conversation has been amazing to witness.
[03:26:28.378 --> 03:26:28.879]  Yeah, I mean...
[03:26:30.114 --> 03:26:47.444]  It's weird, it's like you see these kind of familiar episodes, these 1984 style scenes playing out in real time and it's like, they are in the UK arresting people for posting stuff on social media right now.
[03:26:47.744 --> 03:26:57.209]  And I know that Australia has a prolific kind of history of overreaching and being really egregious with speech related laws as well and it's like,
[03:26:57.809 --> 03:27:09.111]  I feel like sometimes it's hard to put into context how significant the United States is as a singular player against a global takeover of the freedom of all people.
[03:27:09.171 --> 03:27:16.313]  It's like, there is no place on the planet that has the First Amendment like the United States of America has.
[03:27:16.433 --> 03:27:21.194]  It is the last bastion of free speech that exists on the entire planet.
[03:27:21.829 --> 03:27:22.209]  Period.
[03:27:22.489 --> 03:27:23.530]  There is no other place.
[03:27:23.890 --> 03:27:27.131]  So it's like, nobody has it enshrined into their bill of rights like we do.
[03:27:27.431 --> 03:27:29.892]  Nobody has that protection there for us.
[03:27:30.153 --> 03:27:35.215]  So it's like, if you were to figure out a way to crack into that, you would never be able to speak about anything ever.
[03:27:35.375 --> 03:27:38.256]  Because we know that they chip away at these things very slowly over time.
[03:27:38.456 --> 03:27:48.080]  If you can show somebody a morphed humanoid photo and they can see it with their own eyes and they believe that it's real, it won't be long before they can convince people that words are weapons and words are
[03:27:48.080 --> 03:27:48.480]  We're good to go.
[03:28:13.395 --> 03:28:23.961]  Somebody that really just blatantly will fly in the face of things you know to be reality, then speech and these things that are very paramount, and specific almost to America only, are next.
[03:28:24.485 --> 03:28:50.101]  Yeah I think you're absolutely right and what we're witnessing in the UK is horrifying and I'll just say Australia's already getting prepared for this you know they're raising their terrorism threat they're saying you know oh we're rolling out all these new digital ID comes in in December and now we've got all these systems and they want to check the mental health status of accountants before they process your tax return you know just just insane just squeezing people more and more and more
[03:28:50.601 --> 03:28:58.950]  To this ultimate goal, by the way, which you alluded to before of having, you know, AI government, AI absolutely everything, removing real people.
[03:28:59.010 --> 03:29:02.914]  Yuval Noah Harari says 2024, last year of elections.
[03:29:02.974 --> 03:29:09.101]  This is why they're going so hard against a real human that just says what's on his mind being elected.
[03:29:09.121 --> 03:29:10.662]  I mean, this is how I see it.
[03:29:11.403 --> 03:29:19.511]  Um, but you know, even to the point of of them, you know, trying to stop it, trying to stop that live stream going forward.
[03:29:19.551 --> 03:29:21.934]  What are your thoughts on on the stream, Bobby?
[03:29:21.954 --> 03:29:23.135]  Because I know you would have tuned in.
[03:29:24.076 --> 03:29:24.837]  Yeah.
[03:29:24.997 --> 03:29:25.778]  Yeah, I watched it.
[03:29:25.938 --> 03:29:26.899]  I mean, I think
[03:29:27.637 --> 03:29:38.903]  I think probably the most valuable thing that I gleaned from it, because if you listen to Trump speak, especially if you listen to him speaking consistently over time, he hits a lot of the same points.
[03:29:38.923 --> 03:29:41.365]  We've heard what he's talked about about the shooter.
[03:29:41.425 --> 03:29:43.386]  We've heard what he talked about about the border.
[03:29:43.766 --> 03:30:01.540]  But the one major development that I actually really appreciate, Elon, for harping on multiple times, is he was like, do you think it would be wise to have some type of government spending advisory board that would oversee how the government spends money and validates whether or not it's wasteful?
[03:30:01.820 --> 03:30:06.964]  And he mentioned this multiple times, even though Trump didn't really give him a direct answer, which I don't necessarily mean
[03:30:07.585 --> 03:30:08.547]  I think he deflects.
[03:30:08.587 --> 03:30:12.075]  I think he was very excitable and wanted to run through the things he wanted to say.
[03:30:12.395 --> 03:30:15.702]  But Elon really mentioned it multiple times which I thought was a huge development.
[03:30:16.003 --> 03:30:16.384]  And it's like...
[03:30:17.208 --> 03:30:24.453]  People need to understand, A, how important it is that Elon Musk works with whatever administration, number one.
[03:30:24.774 --> 03:30:40.185]  And number two, that if such a thing was to exist, that thing could almost single-handedly stop the inflation bleed and the debt bleed, and really solve so many more of our problems, even than modifying policies would.
[03:30:40.666 --> 03:30:46.330]  I think it was Warren Buffett said one time, he's like, if you want to balance the budget,
[03:30:46.670 --> 03:30:46.910]  Yeah.
[03:30:46.930 --> 03:30:47.030]  Yeah.
[03:31:07.336 --> 03:31:08.737]  Specifically related to money.
[03:31:08.998 --> 03:31:11.780]  I think it would solve a lot of problems about the economy.
[03:31:12.000 --> 03:31:13.582]  It would solve a lot of inflation problems.
[03:31:13.802 --> 03:31:16.464]  It would solve a lot of the energy problems, the wasteful spending problems.
[03:31:16.704 --> 03:31:27.393]  And then once people got that taste of freedom, they might be more inclined to realize that a lot of these other policies that are non-interventionalist, keep your own money, keep your own freedom, actually do work.
[03:31:27.654 --> 03:31:30.136]  And I think that would be a huge development if that actually happened.
[03:31:30.396 --> 03:31:31.516]  Yeah, I have to agree with you.
[03:31:31.556 --> 03:31:33.897]  I mean, I think Elon's got still got a little way to go.
[03:31:33.957 --> 03:31:38.318]  He himself, by the way, said, you know, he was a supporter of Obama.
[03:31:38.578 --> 03:31:44.460]  And, you know, I think he even said, I'm I'm sort of traditionally a Democrat.
[03:31:44.820 --> 03:31:46.040]  I think he used those words.
[03:31:46.100 --> 03:31:47.881]  Don't if I'm quoting him, he did.
[03:31:47.941 --> 03:31:48.341]  OK, good.
[03:31:48.821 --> 03:31:49.701]  He said he leaned left.
[03:31:49.921 --> 03:31:50.321]  Lean left.
[03:31:50.341 --> 03:31:51.141]  Traditionally lean left.
[03:31:51.161 --> 03:31:51.622]  Lean left.
[03:31:51.682 --> 03:31:51.922]  Right.
[03:31:52.022 --> 03:31:52.382]  Okay.
[03:31:52.442 --> 03:32:03.125]  So, so, and he's, he's able to, I think that the symbology here is that anyone can sit down and have a conversation if it's, you know, if two people approach it with common sense.
[03:32:04.706 --> 03:32:10.368]  And, and someone, you know, I saw this, this leftist write an article and they said, oh, Elon, you know,
[03:32:11.488 --> 03:32:14.531]  Going towards the far right, being radicalised.
[03:32:14.591 --> 03:32:19.356]  And my question back to that person was, would you still call them radicalised if they were going more far left?
[03:32:19.656 --> 03:32:21.158]  If this person was going more far left?
[03:32:21.198 --> 03:32:22.339]  No, no, you actually wouldn't.
[03:32:22.780 --> 03:32:23.140]  You wouldn't.
[03:32:23.160 --> 03:32:26.924]  You would say that's great and they're becoming more liberated or something.
[03:32:26.964 --> 03:32:29.246]  It's like it's still radical whichever way you go.
[03:32:29.627 --> 03:32:32.249]  It's just what is a good radical or bad, you know?
[03:32:32.590 --> 03:32:33.571]  But anyway, I digress.
[03:32:34.031 --> 03:32:39.935]  Well, my point is, you know, my slight concerns are Elon's beliefs about climate change.
[03:32:39.975 --> 03:32:41.957]  I really hope he wakes up to that scam.
[03:32:43.138 --> 03:32:47.261]  And, you know, I think he's evolving in his thinking, hopefully.
[03:32:48.622 --> 03:32:53.746]  But he definitely has the ability to assist with technology in something like what you're talking about.
[03:32:53.786 --> 03:32:57.629]  I mean, this is one of the key reasons, one of the biggest problems that we have.
[03:32:58.509 --> 03:33:03.093]  In Australia, there was a Member of Parliament, I've brought this up so many times, but I don't know if I've told you, Bobby.
[03:33:03.533 --> 03:33:07.097]  She was talking about how we need to be able to change.
[03:33:07.378 --> 03:33:11.263]  Transgender people need to have the right to change their gender after they're dead.
[03:33:12.184 --> 03:33:16.088]  These are the kinds of things taxpayer dollars are going on.
[03:33:16.109 --> 03:33:17.751]  We need some common sense.
[03:33:18.883 --> 03:33:20.503]  Yes, oh that's perfect.
[03:33:21.144 --> 03:33:25.805]  I did not hear that, but I'm literally not surprised in the slightest bit.
[03:33:26.925 --> 03:33:35.987]  I think that the thing to reiterate about Elon, and I saw a lot of conservatives freak out about Joe Rogan saying a nice thing about Bobby Kennedy.
[03:33:36.467 --> 03:33:39.668]  I think that there's something really important for everybody to understand.
[03:33:40.148 --> 03:33:41.068]  You shouldn't believe
[03:33:41.733 --> 03:33:42.894]  We're good to go.
[03:34:01.328 --> 03:34:11.514]  It's seemingly uncommon for most people to see that it's better for that person, especially if they have a cultural impact, influence, and intelligence, and something to bring to the table, to be on your side than not.
[03:34:11.754 --> 03:34:14.656]  I saw a lot of people on the right freak out about Joe Rogan.
[03:34:14.676 --> 03:34:23.381]  And it's like, Joe Rogan spoke out about a lot of things that put him in a lot of hot water when he was not a person that was a fan of conservatives or a fan of the right.
[03:34:23.621 --> 03:34:26.543]  And you're going to suggest that he's some type of traitor, turncoat, whatever.
[03:34:26.903 --> 03:34:31.245]  Flip on him on a dime because he says a nice thing about Bobby Kennedy, not even an endorsement.
[03:34:31.485 --> 03:34:36.067]  It's like, that's the type of stuff that gets people to not come over to your side.
[03:34:36.288 --> 03:34:42.871]  So I wish people could just understand that we're better with Joe Rogan agreeing with us even 20% of the time.
[03:34:43.151 --> 03:34:46.372]  We're better with Elon Musk agreeing with us 5% of the time.
[03:34:46.652 --> 03:34:50.794]  If he, generally speaking, is able to push us in the right direction, we want him.
[03:34:50.814 --> 03:34:52.015]  And here's the other thing about Elon.
[03:34:52.235 --> 03:34:56.017]  It's like, if we do not understand that Elon Musk
[03:34:57.012 --> 03:35:02.516]  is literally an American hero in real life.
[03:35:02.816 --> 03:35:08.319]  If we can't understand that, despite whatever foibles we think, he also took the mysterious potion.
[03:35:08.380 --> 03:35:11.401]  He also said that he thinks the mysterious potion is good, and he took it.
[03:35:11.882 --> 03:35:22.709]  But it's like, he also may have single-handedly helped restore the distribution of free speech for this upcoming election, which is a heroic American act, a patriotic act
[03:35:23.229 --> 03:35:24.029]  Beyond all else.
[03:35:24.269 --> 03:35:32.212]  And even if he was to just do that, and then say, you know what, I'm gonna vote for Kamala Harris, he would have still done something heroic for the American citizens.
[03:35:32.493 --> 03:35:39.195]  And as I said before, for the human beings of Earth, because of his preservation of the distribution of free speech.
[03:35:39.455 --> 03:35:44.077]  And that is of note, and something that can never be taken away from him, even if he was to turn on it.
[03:35:44.317 --> 03:35:50.259]  The fact that he even did it at this very crucial time, I think he deserves our respect, regardless if he has 50 or 500 bad takes.
[03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:53.981]  That's such a great point, Bobby.
[03:35:54.021 --> 03:36:10.790]  And I know that, you know, you because you're so involved with your audience and people who disagree with you as well, you've you've really come because I've watched your thinking evolve on a lot of things, like I said, and then you get your audience just viciously coming at you.
[03:36:10.810 --> 03:36:13.092]  I've seen it happen on more than one occasion.
[03:36:13.612 --> 03:36:20.276]  And so that's why I love your take on this, because what is it that you think makes conservatives
[03:36:27.482 --> 03:36:32.727]  Because I think that the left and the right, look, we're all in one human family.
[03:36:32.767 --> 03:36:35.009]  I mean, I've hit a bunch of cliches, but it really is true.
[03:36:35.329 --> 03:36:39.613]  And I really think that the right is just as bad as the left in a multitude of ways.
[03:36:39.894 --> 03:36:43.437]  And I think in a lot of ways, you know, some of the things that we make fun of the left for
[03:36:43.737 --> 03:36:46.678]  It's just as easy to make fun of people on the right for.
[03:36:46.999 --> 03:36:54.782]  And I think that it really is similar human behavior, just with a different target or a different trajectory.
[03:36:55.042 --> 03:36:58.664]  Not to suggest that they're more right or more correct.
[03:36:58.964 --> 03:37:01.025]  I certainly believe that the right is more often than not.
[03:37:01.485 --> 03:37:03.466]  But we freak out the same way.
[03:37:03.566 --> 03:37:05.207]  We get emotional in the same way.
[03:37:05.567 --> 03:37:11.529]  There's some people that like super, super radical things on the right that, to me, are unfathomable and unrealistic.
[03:37:11.749 --> 03:37:12.830]  And the same goes for the left.
[03:37:13.210 --> 03:37:20.793]  The way that the left will point out, you know, the most racist, bigoted, you know, middle America person saying something super dumb at a Trump rally.
[03:37:21.253 --> 03:37:27.415]  You know, we also will point out the leftists, them that identifies as a giraffe, at a Kamala rally.
[03:37:27.455 --> 03:37:30.177]  So we like literally do the exact same thing.
[03:37:30.477 --> 03:37:31.017]  And I think that
[03:37:31.744 --> 03:37:46.489]  You know, you know, you once the thing that you had mentioned before the break is like, should we all just like kind of get in line and, you know, be a team player and kind of like put out, you know, not to put words in your mouth, but almost like dumber down content to keep it focused and and make sure that our side wins.
[03:37:46.629 --> 03:37:47.350]  Well, not necessarily.
[03:37:47.370 --> 03:37:48.910]  Let me just not dumb.
[03:37:49.330 --> 03:37:50.391]  Not not dumb.
[03:37:50.411 --> 03:37:55.973]  What I'm saying is not be so publicly vicious towards people on our own side.
[03:37:56.833 --> 03:37:58.114]  All the time, you know?
[03:37:58.154 --> 03:38:03.297]  More unified, to just get a better outcome for the country and the world, is what I'm trying to say.
[03:38:04.197 --> 03:38:22.047]  Yeah, no, it was hard for me to explain it, which is kind of the second part of my point, which is like, if we were to choose to take the simple route at doing something, and not do the thing that was hard, not do the thing that was difficult, not do the thing that took perhaps years if not decades to achieve,
[03:38:22.677 --> 03:38:24.899]  Would there be an America in the first place?
[03:38:25.379 --> 03:38:30.262]  If anyone had shied away from these seemingly impossible tasks, would there be a First Amendment?
[03:38:30.322 --> 03:38:32.063]  Would there be a Thomas Jefferson?
[03:38:32.083 --> 03:38:34.225]  Would there be a George Washington?
[03:38:34.485 --> 03:38:36.946]  Would those things have even happened from the start?
[03:38:37.046 --> 03:38:39.388]  It's like, if they had chosen the easy route.
[03:38:39.728 --> 03:38:50.015]  So, to me, I always look at my content and say, you know, should I just say, Trump good, let's keep everybody together, let's make sure that I get more followers, sell the hat, sell the shirt?
[03:38:50.295 --> 03:38:51.956]  It's like, I can't do it.
[03:38:52.496 --> 03:39:00.905]  And I remember a long time ago, I'd asked a business coach, I was complaining because there was a cat video guy that was getting 500 times as many views as me.
[03:39:01.165 --> 03:39:03.267]  And I said, should I just start making cat videos?
[03:39:03.587 --> 03:39:09.213]  And he said, if you believe that that was the right thing in your heart and soul, that's what you would already be making.
[03:39:09.613 --> 03:39:13.237]  You don't even need to ask me that question because your actions have already dictated it.
[03:39:13.517 --> 03:39:15.019]  And I look at the way that
[03:39:15.837 --> 03:39:18.098]  I approach this type of information the same way.
[03:39:18.138 --> 03:39:27.243]  It's like, could Alex Jones have worked at a mainstream news organization 25 years ago and made a crap ton more money and not had anybody come for his throat his whole life?
[03:39:27.724 --> 03:39:28.264]  For sure!
[03:39:28.564 --> 03:39:30.005]  Could he have been Piers Morgan?
[03:39:30.425 --> 03:39:31.066]  Absolutely!
[03:39:31.126 --> 03:39:32.787]  Could he have done any of those other things?
[03:39:33.067 --> 03:39:33.387]  For sure.
[03:39:33.627 --> 03:39:49.802]  And no, not to say that Alex or anybody is perfect as I illustrated before, but it's like, here's an example of a person doing the hard thing and perhaps not having all of the familiar trappings of success, but having the hearts and minds of the people, which is a lot of what kind of Trump does.
[03:39:49.842 --> 03:39:56.248]  It's like, here's a guy that had a great, incredible life that did something that is in so many ways heroic, imperfect as he is.
[03:39:56.957 --> 03:39:58.618]  What is that respect worth?
[03:39:58.839 --> 03:40:03.082]  What is that historical value worth in the whole grand scheme of history?
[03:40:03.322 --> 03:40:05.624]  We still quote Benjamin Franklin to this day.
[03:40:06.004 --> 03:40:07.605]  Imagine being of that importance.
[03:40:07.645 --> 03:40:12.128]  And I think that you, all of us, have the capacity to be that in our own little way.
[03:40:12.369 --> 03:40:13.750]  And I think that's what Elon's doing.
[03:40:13.790 --> 03:40:14.690]  That's what Trump's doing.
[03:40:14.890 --> 03:40:16.692]  That's the decision that Alex decided to make.
[03:40:16.892 --> 03:40:17.833]  That's what you're deciding to do.
[03:40:17.973 --> 03:40:23.477]  That's what people that watch this are deciding to do, because they could just as easily watch Netflix, but they choose not to, because they care.
[03:40:23.988 --> 03:40:24.948]  Yeah, such a great point.
[03:40:25.028 --> 03:40:35.193]  And this is a conversation I've had with quite a few people since I've been here, by the way, which is, you know, that the Dems are better at optics in terms of, you know, appearing more unified.
[03:40:35.673 --> 03:40:50.360]  But by the same token, if we were just aiming to be better at optics, which, you know, there is some merit in that, but if it meant that we weren't being genuine about our views, genuine about our concerns, then we wouldn't be the right, right?
[03:40:51.780 --> 03:40:52.380]  That's the thing.
[03:40:52.701 --> 03:40:52.901]  Yes.
[03:40:53.681 --> 03:41:01.749]  Yes, but that's the other thing is like, you know, there's a saying in business where it's like the best product doesn't sell the most, the best marketed one does.
[03:41:02.170 --> 03:41:12.039]  So the difference, what I am trying to contribute in my own little way, much like the chef cooks for the army men and still has a valuable, you know, just as much as the guy that carries the gun in war.
[03:41:12.360 --> 03:41:17.385]  It's like what I'm trying to do is say, hey, the right has a branding and marketing problem.
[03:41:17.825 --> 03:41:32.670]  People are going to be brainwashed and dumb, but it's like, if I have the ability to understand branding and marketing, I have to do the best that I can to help package up and market deliverable messages, because I think that the right has a better product, but far inferior branding and marketing.
[03:41:32.990 --> 03:41:37.232]  And one of the examples that I've given in a multitude of speeches and on podcasts is whatnot.
[03:41:37.822 --> 03:41:38.303]  We're good to go.
[03:41:50.834 --> 03:41:52.135]  Everybody would understand it.
[03:41:52.495 --> 03:41:53.835]  Everybody knows what a baby is.
[03:41:54.095 --> 03:41:54.736]  It's innocent.
[03:41:55.036 --> 03:41:58.137]  It's the most beautiful, you know, innocent thing that could ever be.
[03:41:58.417 --> 03:42:00.938]  But if you say pro-life, it's not a baby anymore.
[03:42:00.978 --> 03:42:01.858]  It's just a life.
[03:42:02.158 --> 03:42:03.459]  It disappears into the breeze.
[03:42:03.979 --> 03:42:06.640]  A flower has life, but a flower is not a baby.
[03:42:06.960 --> 03:42:08.341]  And everyone knows what a baby is.
[03:42:08.381 --> 03:42:10.382]  When you think the word baby, you see baby.
[03:42:10.742 --> 03:42:13.883]  And I think that that's the type of branding and marketing that we need to reiterate.
[03:42:14.183 --> 03:42:18.605]  And that's the thing that the right misses when it comes up with bills, like the don't say gay bill.
[03:42:19.245 --> 03:42:24.549]  People on the right got branded so hard on the Don't Say Gay Bill that they refer to it as the Don't Say Gay Bill.
[03:42:24.770 --> 03:42:27.572]  It's the Parental Rights and Education Act, or I think that's what it's called.
[03:42:27.772 --> 03:42:33.957]  See, it's a stupid name, but they're so good at branding that they've gotten us to Jedi mind trick and say their thing.
[03:42:34.217 --> 03:42:41.042]  If the right was to learn and take out of their playbook, our message and our better product would be delivered on a wider scale.
[03:42:41.483 --> 03:42:46.166]  Yeah, I agree, and there is a way to do that without being deceitful like they are.
[03:42:49.128 --> 03:42:49.768]  Good evening!
[03:42:49.808 --> 03:42:50.109]  Good evening!
[03:43:23.152 --> 03:43:25.013]  Good evening, everyone.
[03:43:25.293 --> 03:43:28.275]  Good evening.
[03:43:28.355 --> 03:43:31.657]  Good evening.
[03:43:32.418 --> 03:43:32.658]  What?
[03:43:35.139 --> 03:43:36.340]  So I'm inspired.
[03:43:36.360 --> 03:43:38.421]  I don't know about you, Bobby, but I am inspired.
[03:43:38.441 --> 03:43:41.523]  I feel like I feel like I'm going to have a good evening.
[03:43:42.754 --> 03:43:44.154]  Yeah, no, it's great.
[03:43:44.315 --> 03:43:47.216]  It's so again, the left is so good at this stuff.
[03:43:47.256 --> 03:43:51.457]  It's like that guy is like a manic fidgety, like squirrely weirdo.
[03:43:51.737 --> 03:43:53.638]  And they like they got ahead of it.
[03:43:53.658 --> 03:43:57.039]  They're like, let's pick this like weird, like soggy guy.
[03:43:57.399 --> 03:43:59.159]  And let's call the other guy weird.
[03:43:59.420 --> 03:44:03.181]  Let's call like the guy that served the intelligent guy that started businesses successfully.
[03:44:03.401 --> 03:44:04.781]  Let's call him weird.
[03:44:05.101 --> 03:44:09.723]  And I actually was watching John Oliver last night because I love to see the complete wrong take
[03:44:10.163 --> 03:44:11.723]  And he was making a joke about J.D.
[03:44:11.784 --> 03:44:12.584]  Vance's laugh.
[03:44:12.744 --> 03:44:14.964]  And I'm like, yo, they're already on it.
[03:44:15.024 --> 03:44:16.325]  Like, you're going to make fun of J.D.
[03:44:16.385 --> 03:44:19.666]  Vance's laugh when Kamala Crusty Harris has her laugh.
[03:44:20.626 --> 03:44:22.126]  They're just so good at this.
[03:44:22.526 --> 03:44:25.727]  And I think that, like, they're always a few steps ahead.
[03:44:25.967 --> 03:44:27.568]  And these people are super weird.
[03:44:27.808 --> 03:44:29.608]  You want to put a tampon in a boy's bathroom.
[03:44:29.768 --> 03:44:31.709]  You want to lie about things and be squirrely.
[03:44:31.729 --> 03:44:34.570]  And, oh, I'm 60 years old and I don't have any stock.
[03:44:35.050 --> 03:44:36.090]  How is that a flex?
[03:44:36.130 --> 03:44:39.151]  Like, these people suck and they're so strange and weird.
[03:44:40.011 --> 03:44:40.911]  They do suck.
[03:44:43.332 --> 03:44:49.354]  But, you know, it's not just that in terms of his life achievements, there really isn't any.
[03:44:49.394 --> 03:44:51.135]  It's the fact that the man is a liar.
[03:44:51.175 --> 03:44:54.036]  He's lied about his military service record.
[03:44:55.176 --> 03:45:03.339]  Again, just another example of just how seriously deceitful these people are and how much contempt they have for even their own base.
[03:45:05.240 --> 03:45:06.220]  What are your thoughts about that?
[03:45:06.421 --> 03:45:11.464]  In my opinion, Bobby, this is such a big scandal, it could actually kill his political career.
[03:45:12.424 --> 03:45:19.949]  Well, that's why I was saying I watched John Oliver last night, because like I said, he always gives literally the complete opposite wrong take.
[03:45:20.329 --> 03:45:21.450]  They're so brilliant at this.
[03:45:21.910 --> 03:45:31.196]  They basically said that they identified one part of the Stolen Valor story, and he basically tried to debunk that one part while completely not addressing
[03:45:31.656 --> 03:45:32.577]  All of the other parts.
[03:45:32.837 --> 03:45:36.239]  And he's like, look, if this thing's incorrect, then none of those things are correct.
[03:45:36.459 --> 03:45:44.583]  Kind of like if you show a real photo from a Kamala Harris rally, and then 40 of them that are edited, it's like, well, this one's real, so they're all real.
[03:45:44.884 --> 03:45:54.429]  It's like, there was this quote he said, he said he was in Bagram Air Force Base in Iraq, and he saw a body get taken away on a plane that changed his life.
[03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:57.991]  And it's like, Bagram's in Afghanistan, and he didn't go to Iraq,
[03:45:58.551 --> 03:45:59.412]  Or Afghanistan.
[03:45:59.712 --> 03:46:10.222]  So it's like, it goes back to the same point from the very beginning where it's like, if they'll lie about one thing and no one will call them out on it, if they can lie directly to their face, why wouldn't they lie?
[03:46:10.522 --> 03:46:13.945]  It's so disrespectful to their base, but these people don't even care.
[03:46:14.226 --> 03:46:19.971]  And that's why I've kind of lost the thought that I'm going to appeal or convert a person on the left.
[03:46:20.291 --> 03:46:30.458]  The real person that I try to speak to is to activate and mobilize the people that already generally agree with my worldview and the people that are sitting in the middle that might potentially come over.
[03:46:30.699 --> 03:46:34.421]  Because the people on the left that are already saying that these guys are great, they're cooked.
[03:46:34.541 --> 03:46:35.642]  Like, they're cooked permanently.
[03:46:35.662 --> 03:46:38.044]  They're gonna have to navigate their own way there, sadly.
[03:46:38.550 --> 03:46:39.791]  Yeah, I think you're right about that.
[03:46:39.851 --> 03:46:53.904]  And you know, I had a very interesting conversation with a couple of liberal people recently, and they were, I wouldn't say unreasonable people, you know, touched on some subjects that would
[03:46:54.164 --> 03:46:58.568]  Normally it would be difficult to discuss with liberals, but this is a particular passion of mine.
[03:46:58.608 --> 03:47:03.672]  I love trying to, you know, open the minds of people who are stuck.
[03:47:03.732 --> 03:47:07.515]  I see them as stuck and victims of the propaganda machine.
[03:47:07.535 --> 03:47:09.196]  That's what these people are, they're victims.
[03:47:09.957 --> 03:47:13.400]  And we can kind of help them out and, you know, we're the lifeguards.
[03:47:13.920 --> 03:47:15.162]  That's how I feel.
[03:47:16.223 --> 03:47:17.444]  Genuinely, I care.
[03:47:17.484 --> 03:47:18.265]  Because I care.
[03:47:18.405 --> 03:47:19.266]  I care, Bobby.
[03:47:19.286 --> 03:47:20.267]  And I know you care.
[03:47:20.287 --> 03:47:21.428]  That's why you do what you do.
[03:47:22.570 --> 03:47:24.231]  And so I don't think we should stop doing that.
[03:47:24.271 --> 03:47:26.994]  If you have that skill set, go out and keep doing that.
[03:47:27.054 --> 03:47:29.097]  Keep trying to get those people that are in the middle.
[03:47:29.877 --> 03:47:36.863]  To see the light and see what would be the better way for this country and consequently the rest of the world to move forward.
[03:47:37.183 --> 03:47:44.909]  Because the rest of the West, at least, is really just a mirror of Transgender Visibility Day on the White House.
[03:47:45.089 --> 03:47:45.990]  That's really what it is.
[03:47:46.070 --> 03:47:46.791]  I'm serious.
[03:47:46.851 --> 03:47:50.233]  This is Australia and the UK.
[03:47:50.334 --> 03:47:53.836]  Very sad state of affairs because we don't have strong leadership in the US.
[03:47:54.837 --> 03:47:55.578]  That is the truth.
[03:47:56.098 --> 03:47:57.579]  Bobby, we're almost out of time.
[03:47:57.759 --> 03:48:00.321]  Please, please let people know where they can follow you.
[03:48:00.361 --> 03:48:02.942]  I know your ex account is still in the process of growing.
[03:48:02.962 --> 03:48:06.585]  You're much bigger on IG, but let people know where they can follow you.
[03:48:07.465 --> 03:48:14.930]  Yeah, so at TakeNaps on Instagram, and then you can find all my links at BobbySauce.com or FollowBobby.com.
[03:48:15.652 --> 03:48:16.092]  Amazing.
[03:48:16.112 --> 03:48:18.954]  Well, I'm really grateful for your time and for your insights.
[03:48:18.994 --> 03:48:23.317]  Just such a humble guy that, you know, I think has a lot to offer.
[03:48:23.337 --> 03:48:24.558]  So make sure you give him a follow.
[03:48:24.578 --> 03:48:28.320]  I will be back here next week, next Tuesday.
[03:48:28.721 --> 03:48:32.783]  Make sure to continue to share these broadcasts and support InfoWars.
[03:48:33.244 --> 03:48:36.486]  And you can also find me on zmedia.com.
[03:48:36.626 --> 03:48:40.749]  Z triple E underscore media on X. God bless you all and thank you.
[03:48:51.772 --> 03:48:59.820]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements.
[03:49:00.801 --> 03:49:04.585]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[03:49:05.026 --> 03:49:07.228]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[03:49:08.049 --> 03:49:13.475]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[03:49:14.531 --> 03:49:23.094]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[03:49:23.434 --> 03:49:25.295]  We had five companies making product for us.
[03:49:25.915 --> 03:49:30.417]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're Infowars.
[03:49:31.137 --> 03:49:36.799]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[03:49:36.819 --> 03:49:39.700]  I'm not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[03:49:40.520 --> 03:49:42.041]  And they said, listen, you know
[03:49:43.263 --> 03:49:59.253]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[03:49:59.634 --> 03:50:06.298]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[03:50:07.455 --> 03:50:18.283]  Our products and a lot of the products that we developed, but so many of these products that they had put out again were the exact same thing that we were putting out.
[03:50:19.292 --> 03:50:27.396]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we were even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[03:50:27.476 --> 03:50:34.120]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[03:50:34.260 --> 03:50:36.761]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[03:50:36.921 --> 03:50:38.842]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[03:50:39.042 --> 03:50:48.833]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[03:50:49.454 --> 03:50:51.857]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[03:50:51.917 --> 03:50:52.978]  Take Turmeric 95.
[03:50:54.640 --> 03:51:01.346]  Turmeric 95 is called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[03:51:01.466 --> 03:51:07.132]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[03:51:07.232 --> 03:51:15.780]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTore.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[03:51:15.800 --> 03:51:17.902]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[03:51:17.922 --> 03:51:18.262]  And
[03:51:19.508 --> 03:51:32.801]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[03:51:33.282 --> 03:51:37.686]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[03:51:37.746 --> 03:51:42.391]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[03:51:43.392 --> 03:51:48.615]  So I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[03:51:48.715 --> 03:51:49.336]  It's amazing.
[03:51:49.456 --> 03:51:50.376]  It's super high quality.
[03:51:50.456 --> 03:51:52.297]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[03:52:12.631 --> 03:52:13.112]  Thank you.
