[00:00:20.034 --> 00:00:23.357]  It's Monday, August 5th, 2024, and all hell is breaking loose.
[00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.887]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:40.289]  91 days out from the election, then the 79 days to hell before Trump's inaugurated.
[00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.732]  Massive broadcast today, Tommy Robinson joining us as the UK is engulfed in civil unrest.
[00:00:48.972 --> 00:00:52.874]  Nick Fuentes joining us as well, coming up to give his take on things.
[00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:56.275]  Gerald Cilente, Economist Kirk Elliott on the total.
[00:00:57.677 --> 00:00:58.758]  Stock market meltdown.
[00:00:58.778 --> 00:01:05.662]  Over the last three weeks, I've been imminently predicting as part of the globalist toolbox, and it's 100% staged.
[00:01:06.243 --> 00:01:07.283]  I said it on Saturday.
[00:01:07.383 --> 00:01:08.184]  I said it on Sunday.
[00:01:08.244 --> 00:01:14.348]  I said, watch the stock market tank on Monday when Warren Buffett dumped 55% of the number one stock in the world.
[00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:15.549]  That's Apple.
[00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:18.751]  He called the top, and he's got all the insiders.
[00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:20.672]  He's not the Oracle who predicts it.
[00:01:21.293 --> 00:01:25.936]  He's in with the globalist insiders, one of their captains, one of their generals, and they're running it.
[00:01:26.877 --> 00:01:29.479]  So they're fleecing the public right now.
[00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:33.602]  The Dow Jones plunges up over 1,500 points as stocks sell off.
[00:01:35.443 --> 00:01:36.143]  Breaking U.S.
[00:01:36.183 --> 00:01:38.825]  Fed calls emergency meeting as Japan markets collapse.
[00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:41.427]  Global stock market meltdown as fears grow.
[00:01:41.507 --> 00:01:41.687]  U.S.
[00:01:41.707 --> 00:01:43.468]  economy will, quote, collapse.
[00:01:43.488 --> 00:01:44.949]  These are mainstream news headlines.
[00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.731]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:01:47.771 --> 00:01:50.593]  Global market crash from Asia markets to crypto prices.
[00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:50.873]  U.S.
[00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:53.295]  recession fears jolt financial markets globally.
[00:01:53.335 --> 00:01:56.077]  We've been in a recession for many years, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:56.843 --> 00:02:04.748]  They've just been cooking the numbers and the books, and Warren Buffett and his cohorts triggered the whole thing.
[00:02:04.868 --> 00:02:05.668]  What's coming next?
[00:02:05.848 --> 00:02:08.910]  Well, I've got a really good idea.
[00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:21.478]  As I said, the day they shot Trump, civil unrest, cyber attacks, expanded war.
[00:02:21.538 --> 00:02:24.400]  You've now got Israel and Iran about to go to full war.
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.481]  They're saying imminently.
[00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:29.143]  They're saying probably today Israel may strike first.
[00:02:29.263 --> 00:02:34.468]  Israel could preemptively strike Iran if intelligence shows attack is imminent.
[00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:43.316]  Iran is threatening massive attacks after their political and military head of Hamas has been killed.
[00:02:43.336 --> 00:02:44.637]  They're funding them through Hezbollah.
[00:02:45.796 --> 00:02:50.498]  And they've got all their sleeper cells across Europe, the UK, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand.
[00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.200]  And the globalists have opened the doors for this as part of a larger plan.
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.464]  And predicting is coming, as they said, they'll have an angrier world, a destabilized planet, so they can bring in their police state control grid.
[00:03:01.924 --> 00:03:04.146]  And of course, they're everywhere calling for Tommy Robinson's arrest.
[00:03:04.626 --> 00:03:12.370]  And all he's called for is peace, as the illegal aliens and the hordes of Islamists rape, kill, murder, steal at their leisure.
[00:03:13.641 --> 00:03:16.564]  So Tommy gave us a big update last night that went mega viral.
[00:03:16.704 --> 00:03:20.929]  You'll hear directly from the guy they're trying to blame all this for when they're the ones clearly to blame.
[00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:24.493]  And then, as I said, other huge guests coming on.
[00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:28.858]  He'll be with us till the bottom of the hour, and then I'm gonna go right in the economy in great detail and tell you what I think.
[00:03:29.458 --> 00:03:33.441]  It's coming next, and unfortunately you see everything I've been saying coming true to the day.
[00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:37.144]  I mean, I told you when Biden would step down, and he did two weeks before.
[00:03:37.164 --> 00:03:38.865]  I just, I'm really inside their heads.
[00:03:39.305 --> 00:03:47.471]  I'm going to be joining Tucker Carlson, unless there's World War III on the road, coming up with one of the first dates in Pennsylvania in September.
[00:03:47.991 --> 00:03:52.254]  So that's part of getting out there on the road and getting the global's faces.
[00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:54.896]  And so we'll play a little clip with Tucker talking about this.
[00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:56.137]  We'll come right back with Tommy Robinson.
[00:03:57.591 --> 00:04:02.457]  So they always tell you it's the most important election of your lifetime, but of course this one actually is.
[00:04:02.537 --> 00:04:03.438]  That's demonstrable.
[00:04:03.478 --> 00:04:07.783]  And it's also because it is so important being censored at every level by the tech companies.
[00:04:08.363 --> 00:04:18.234]  So we were thinking about this a couple of months ago and we thought why not get on the road live in front of actual people, live audiences, coast to coast, a nationwide tour where we can't be censored.
[00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:19.531]  That'd be good.
[00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:20.552]  It would also be fun.
[00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:21.172]  So we're doing it.
[00:04:21.192 --> 00:04:31.538]  We're going to be on stage with some of our friends, some of the most fascinating people we know, the most recognizable people we know, responding to what is happening in America this September in real time.
[00:04:32.452 --> 00:04:34.653]  It'll be just like the podcast, but it's going to be live.
[00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:39.816]  So we're excited to announce our friend Larry Elder is coming to join us in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
[00:04:39.856 --> 00:04:43.238]  Our friend John Rich will be there with us in Sunrise, Florida.
[00:04:43.258 --> 00:04:44.178]  We're adding more stops.
[00:04:44.198 --> 00:04:47.120]  We just added another stadium show in Redding, Pennsylvania.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.821]  We'll be joined on stage by Alex Jones.
[00:04:49.861 --> 00:04:51.242]  They tell you what Alex Jones is like.
[00:04:51.462 --> 00:04:52.423]  Have you seen him in person?
[00:04:52.563 --> 00:04:52.983]  You should.
[00:04:53.483 --> 00:04:54.264]  Make up your own mind.
[00:04:54.884 --> 00:04:59.554]  It's going to be fun as hell and interesting and intense, and we hope you will join us.
[00:04:59.935 --> 00:05:02.821]  Go to TuckerCarlson.com right now to get your tickets.
[00:05:03.142 --> 00:05:03.462]  See you there.
[00:05:04.485 --> 00:05:06.166]  Very, very excited about that.
[00:05:06.446 --> 00:05:08.987]  Tucker's one of my favorite people in the world, if not my favorite.
[00:05:09.467 --> 00:05:10.127]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:10.147 --> 00:05:10.648]  Stay with us.
[00:05:10.968 --> 00:05:11.948]  Tommy Robinson straight ahead.
[00:05:12.468 --> 00:05:14.909]  It's Monday, August 5th, 2024.
[00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.850]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:17.491 --> 00:05:24.053]  And the world is being artificially plunged into chaos to bring in the New World Order as we predicted they would.
[00:05:24.514 --> 00:05:26.534]  It's all happening like clockwork.
[00:05:27.015 --> 00:05:32.217]  The economic collapse, the cyber attacks, the civil unrest, the assassination attempts,
[00:05:33.868 --> 00:05:35.549]  War is massively expanding.
[00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:40.133]  All to bring in the One World Government.
[00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.756]  Alright, Tommy Robinson needs no introduction.
[00:05:42.996 --> 00:05:44.677]  The Prime Minister has come out and blamed him.
[00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:46.425]  We're good to go.
[00:06:04.918 --> 00:06:18.201]  No, the police protect them and then attack peaceful crowds, enraging them, and the Prime Minister comes out and blames white supremacists for what's happening, and then says that Tommy, who had planned for seven weeks, is big, unite.
[00:06:19.065 --> 00:06:21.066]  The Kingdom Rally that was on the 27th of July.
[00:06:21.526 --> 00:06:25.508]  For six months publicly he planned to go on a vacation after that was family.
[00:06:26.008 --> 00:06:33.351]  He was arrested for terrorism and then released at the rally he held that was totally peaceful with over 100,000 people in Trafalgar Square in London.
[00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:35.232]  Then he went on vacation to Cyprus.
[00:06:35.252 --> 00:06:42.295]  He was then doxed by the media and calls for violence against him and the Prime Minister saying that he'd run away in fear after commanding the violence.
[00:06:43.055 --> 00:06:44.316]  Absolutely wild.
[00:06:44.356 --> 00:06:49.000]  And the Prime Minister's doubled down in more speeches, saying this is not the British people.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.401]  Everyone loves open borders.
[00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:52.203]  No, this is all Tommy Robinson.
[00:06:52.583 --> 00:06:57.387]  So, Tommy, to give us an update on this situation and where it's going, you joined us again last night.
[00:06:57.407 --> 00:06:57.967]  You're joining us today.
[00:06:57.987 --> 00:06:59.048]  I know there's been a lot of new developments.
[00:06:59.068 --> 00:06:59.689]  Tell us what's happening.
[00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:11.973]  There's been a Cobra meeting today where I find it quite terrifying the fact that they're having a Cobra meeting, that's what they have before going to war, and they're talking about me and my messaging.
[00:07:12.393 --> 00:07:21.115]  Now the insane thing in it is, Alex, I've gone back through today, I'm putting a video out, all of the messages I've done and everything I said.
[00:07:21.655 --> 00:07:30.117]  In every message I said, do not be violent, you lose the argument, do not attack innocent people, do not throw bricks, do not attack police,
[00:07:30.797 --> 00:07:39.164]  Now, when I'm watching the news this morning, the Daily Mail ran a news article yesterday saying I soaked and inflamed the riots from my sun lounger in Cyprus.
[00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:46.890]  Now, today, every news channel this morning are speaking like it's a matter of fact that I incited violence.
[00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.612]  All of them are saying he's been inciting violence.
[00:07:49.952 --> 00:07:51.052]  I've never incited violence.
[00:07:51.372 --> 00:07:53.953]  But what we find out, the truth doesn't matter.
[00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:55.754]  What you've said doesn't matter.
[00:07:56.114 --> 00:08:01.235]  My name, you can't find me on TikTok, not allowed to mention me on Instagram, not allowed to mention me on Facebook.
[00:08:01.536 --> 00:08:05.917]  So they have the total monopoly to use their weaponized media
[00:08:06.457 --> 00:08:19.988]  To sit across every chat show today, Sky News, BBC, Good Morning Britain, every show has put out, as a matter of fact, that I am the person that instigated that they're my foot soldiers that are rioting.
[00:08:20.328 --> 00:08:23.911]  That goes against every single bit of evidence of what I said.
[00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:27.133]  But they don't care about the evidence because they're now coming after Elon Musk.
[00:08:27.413 --> 00:08:28.334]  That's come out today.
[00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:30.396]  They're talking openly about the need
[00:08:31.156 --> 00:08:31.637]  I don't know.
[00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:41.756]  They're lying, OK?
[00:08:42.056 --> 00:08:42.877]  But they want to lie.
[00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.157]  They've now built me up.
[00:08:44.497 --> 00:08:53.519]  So every Muslim across the country, they've built me up as the person who's organizing the riots and the trouble at their mosque, which is just not, it's not true.
[00:08:53.899 --> 00:08:55.499]  In fact, it's not just not true.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.860]  The truth is the total opposite.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.420]  I've been appealing for calm.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.081]  Every, every demonstration I've had, there's been no trouble.
[00:09:02.681 --> 00:09:10.090]  Tommy, for those that don't know, what really made everybody get pissed was when the three girls got stabbed and the Prime Minister came out and said,
[00:09:20.302 --> 00:09:20.682]  We're good to go.
[00:09:40.466 --> 00:09:54.852]  And there's been no – he hasn't mentioned – everyone's seen the videos of English people being beaten up with hammers, beaten up with bricks, beaten up with bats, beaten up across the country by gangs of Muslims screaming Al-Akbar.
[00:09:56.172 --> 00:10:04.501]  And all he's talked about is defending the Muslims and letting the Muslim community know we're going to spend lots of money to make sure you're safe.
[00:10:04.601 --> 00:10:11.888]  Alex, there is not one single case in the UK of a Muslim woman being raped by non-Muslims.
[00:10:12.369 --> 00:10:12.909]  Not one!
[00:10:13.826 --> 00:10:15.828]  There's 1,000 victims just in Telford.
[00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:17.049]  1,400 victims.
[00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:22.675]  These are English girls that have been absolutely raped and tortured, and all of them by Muslim gangs.
[00:10:23.015 --> 00:10:26.739]  So he doesn't want to reassure English people, we're going to stop this.
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.223]  He wants to reassure the Muslim community, the ones who are running through the streets.
[00:10:31.013 --> 00:10:33.515]  Smashing people, carrying axes, carrying swords.
[00:10:33.795 --> 00:10:35.856]  He's letting them know, we're going to make sure you're alright.
[00:10:36.557 --> 00:10:39.859]  And he talks about me pouring petrol on the fire.
[00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:45.703]  Every time Keir Starmer opens his mouth at the minute, he creates another thousand Tommy Robinsons.
[00:10:46.063 --> 00:10:48.304]  It's like, keep talking Keir, keep talking.
[00:10:48.324 --> 00:10:49.325]  But for me personally,
[00:10:50.884 --> 00:11:00.888]  I'm wondering what they're going to do, because they have purposely built me up as the fool guy, purposely put me up as the man who's organising riots, which is just totally untrue.
[00:11:01.949 --> 00:11:05.490]  If I didn't have X, for five years I was totally censored.
[00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:06.871]  Where would I be now?
[00:11:07.371 --> 00:11:10.572]  The whole country would think I've instigated these riots.
[00:11:11.332 --> 00:11:11.853]  I'm lucky.
[00:11:11.873 --> 00:11:13.493]  I went through my figures.
[00:11:13.513 --> 00:11:17.475]  7 million watch one video, 5 million watch the other, 3 million, 1 million, 1.6 million, 1.4 million.
[00:11:17.495 --> 00:11:17.795]  I'm lucky.
[00:11:20.757 --> 00:11:27.283]  The millions and millions have seen my continued calls for peace, continued calls for non-violence.
[00:11:27.924 --> 00:11:30.306]  Otherwise, the entire country would just be lied to.
[00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:34.260]  They just use the media to lie, to build up the narrative they want.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.680]  And I know what they want to do, Alex.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.861]  They want to lock me up.
[00:11:37.161 --> 00:11:38.581]  They want to lock me up for a long time.
[00:11:38.901 --> 00:11:40.802]  And they want to justify it in the public's eyes.
[00:11:41.162 --> 00:11:44.343]  We had to take him off the streets because he was instigating riots.
[00:11:45.503 --> 00:11:48.224]  Me reporting facts to the public.
[00:11:48.524 --> 00:11:51.485]  Their problem is that I'm a journalist that they can't control.
[00:11:52.025 --> 00:11:54.446]  I'm not going to play their game.
[00:11:55.626 --> 00:12:01.147]  Well, Tommy, here is your rally on the 27th with over 100,000 people, totally peaceful.
[00:12:01.507 --> 00:12:06.329]  They still arrested you for terrorism, using some terrorism regulation, but had to release you.
[00:12:07.109 --> 00:12:10.150]  And so it's 100% clear what they're doing.
[00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.970]  And again, they want to say it's not the British people that are fed up.
[00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:17.091]  No, it's all this magic leprechaun, this evil demon, Tommy Robinson.
[00:12:17.151 --> 00:12:19.552]  He magically caused it all.
[00:12:19.712 --> 00:12:22.133]  If we lock him up, it'll all go away, which is ridiculous.
[00:12:22.513 --> 00:12:23.133]  Now, because of X,
[00:12:24.233 --> 00:12:30.098]  The people of Europe, and not just the UK, they're seeing what the Islamists and others are doing.
[00:12:30.338 --> 00:12:31.259]  That's why they're pissed.
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.583]  And they're also pissed because the film I've put out, they're really pissed.
[00:12:36.663 --> 00:12:39.085]  Alex, you know better than anyone, yeah?
[00:12:39.365 --> 00:12:40.506]  They've weaponized the courts.
[00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:41.747]  They hit you for a billion pounds.
[00:12:41.767 --> 00:12:42.848]  There's no justice, yeah?
[00:12:43.148 --> 00:12:46.290]  They've weaponized the courts to destroy people like me and you.
[00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:48.312]  Katie Hopkins, they seized her home.
[00:12:48.932 --> 00:12:59.176]  Across Europe, when you go through every story, Morton Messerschmidt was the leader of the Danish People's Party, they went through the courts with him, they made up racism allegations, they've done exactly the same.
[00:12:59.456 --> 00:13:01.837]  Gertrude just spoke up, they've done exactly the same.
[00:13:02.117 --> 00:13:04.077]  Marine Le Pen, they've done exactly the same.
[00:13:04.538 --> 00:13:10.660]  Anyone who speaks out against the European Union, anyone who speaks out against their globalist plans,
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:11.800]  We're good.
[00:13:28.161 --> 00:13:31.984]  I have never been able to swallow it.
[00:13:32.345 --> 00:13:35.647]  So I've been so disappointed in myself because I allowed them.
[00:13:35.847 --> 00:13:42.012]  They obviously told me in court, if anyone gets to see the evidence from this case, you can face two years in jail.
[00:13:42.493 --> 00:13:44.094]  Now, two years in jail is terrifying for me.
[00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:48.798]  And I lived with their gagging order up until last week.
[00:13:49.138 --> 00:13:49.819]  So last week,
[00:13:50.976 --> 00:13:53.899]  I played the film, and I decided to be gagged no longer.
[00:13:54.419 --> 00:13:58.923]  And if they want to take me to court, I wanted the world to see the truth.
[00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:01.105]  And the world has now seen the truth.
[00:14:01.245 --> 00:14:02.446]  32 million people have watched that film.
[00:14:02.766 --> 00:14:03.927]  So they're in a predicament now.
[00:14:03.947 --> 00:14:05.849]  If they want to send me to jail, which they do,
[00:14:06.627 --> 00:14:10.288]  Then you're going to send me to jail and everyone who's watched that film knows I told the truth.
[00:14:10.568 --> 00:14:14.649]  My only crime was telling the truth and refusing to back down to their threats.
[00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.671]  So I think that there's lots of reasons why they're gunning for me, but I feel like it's coming from all angles.
[00:14:20.011 --> 00:14:22.732]  As I said, the Daily Mail went and doxxed exactly where my children were.
[00:14:23.032 --> 00:14:25.313]  I've just rang the journalists.
[00:14:25.553 --> 00:14:26.093]  I've just rang them.
[00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:27.713]  And I asked him a simple question.
[00:14:28.254 --> 00:14:30.154]  I said, like, I know where you live now, yeah?
[00:14:30.194 --> 00:14:35.476]  So this person who was involved in the article, Docs and Where Are My Children, I found out every detail about them to date, yeah?
[00:14:35.776 --> 00:14:37.117]  I've got their numbers, their addresses.
[00:14:37.157 --> 00:14:40.398]  So I rang him up and said, let me just ask you a simple question as a journalist.
[00:14:41.118 --> 00:14:41.838]  Is it OK?
[00:14:41.878 --> 00:14:42.459]  I know where you live.
[00:14:42.499 --> 00:14:43.059]  This is where you live.
[00:14:43.739 --> 00:14:48.121]  Is it okay if I get cameras to take pictures and follow you and your family?
[00:14:48.141 --> 00:14:48.701]  Yeah?
[00:14:49.142 --> 00:14:50.242]  So I get pictures of your family.
[00:14:50.622 --> 00:14:51.523]  Is that okay?
[00:14:51.863 --> 00:15:00.127]  And then I do a news article and I let everyone know in my article exactly, not where you are, but where your family are.
[00:15:00.747 --> 00:15:02.208]  Is that okay?
[00:15:03.811 --> 00:15:04.931]  Speak to our legal department.
[00:15:04.951 --> 00:15:06.412]  No, I'm not speaking to your legal department.
[00:15:06.712 --> 00:15:07.392]  I'm asking you.
[00:15:08.432 --> 00:15:11.393]  This is the weaponised media.
[00:15:11.513 --> 00:15:12.433]  This isn't a mistake.
[00:15:12.993 --> 00:15:14.294]  There are Muslim groups now.
[00:15:15.494 --> 00:15:19.115]  There are Muslim groups online saying that people need to come to where my family are.
[00:15:19.135 --> 00:15:21.476]  I keep my family's location secret.
[00:15:21.896 --> 00:15:23.736]  We have moved ten times.
[00:15:24.676 --> 00:15:26.737]  I live in a different country from my family.
[00:15:27.492 --> 00:15:28.852]  I don't live in the same house.
[00:15:28.872 --> 00:15:31.413]  That's how I have to live when people want to kill me.
[00:15:31.913 --> 00:15:40.355]  And they've gone and purposely let—Northern Cyprus is a Muslim—they've purposely let them know exactly where my family are.
[00:15:40.935 --> 00:15:41.915]  And that isn't a mistake.
[00:15:42.295 --> 00:15:44.216]  That is the media being used as a weapon.
[00:15:44.396 --> 00:15:45.116]  They're trying to kill you.
[00:15:45.136 --> 00:15:47.696]  They're trying to kill your family.
[00:15:48.056 --> 00:15:49.937]  That's exactly what it is, and they've done it.
[00:15:50.697 --> 00:15:52.298]  Well, look what they just did, Tommy.
[00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:53.579]  Talk about Trump.
[00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:55.181]  I mean, they've escalated the political violence.
[00:15:55.461 --> 00:15:56.482]  What about I'm trying to kill Trump?
[00:15:56.502 --> 00:15:57.342]  They're going to try again.
[00:15:57.682 --> 00:16:01.686]  Give us your take on that and then tell me the latest going on in Ireland.
[00:16:01.746 --> 00:16:03.407]  Notice they're not really trying to blame you for that.
[00:16:03.707 --> 00:16:05.368]  The Irish have already been uprising for a year.
[00:16:05.408 --> 00:16:06.329]  It's been intensifying.
[00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:13.295]  But because I guess that doesn't fit the narrative because you're the supposed English Defense League that hasn't even existed in a decade.
[00:16:13.315 --> 00:16:16.577]  And now we know about the Muslim Defense League, which is the police department.
[00:16:16.597 --> 00:16:17.878]  But speak to Trump.
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:24.042]  How that adds to this and then what you think is coming next in the UK with this incredibly unpopular Prime Minister.
[00:16:25.752 --> 00:16:34.598]  The same people who attempted to execute Donald Trump are the same people that have attempted to silence me for the same reasons for the last 15 years.
[00:16:35.018 --> 00:16:36.419]  That's the reason I will be locked up.
[00:16:36.799 --> 00:16:39.341]  That's the reason that censorship has come down on all of us.
[00:16:39.681 --> 00:16:43.524]  It's the same people with the same worldview, with the same goal.
[00:16:43.924 --> 00:16:50.008]  The goal to destroy the nation, the goal to weaken the West, the goal to replace our populations, the goal to break down the family.
[00:16:50.408 --> 00:16:51.389]  All of it's the same.
[00:16:51.409 --> 00:16:52.770]  Now, Donald Trump stands in their way.
[00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:54.411]  In England, I stand in their way.
[00:16:54.591 --> 00:16:56.334]  Yeah, or my journalism certainly does.
[00:16:56.534 --> 00:17:00.501]  And if it doesn't stand in their way, I am awakening people to what it is.
[00:17:00.722 --> 00:17:05.129]  When I saw what happened with Donald Trump, do you know how it is a miracle?
[00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:08.495]  Do you know how he shouldn't be here?
[00:17:09.076 --> 00:17:11.737]  In their plan, they planned everything.
[00:17:12.058 --> 00:17:12.618]  He was gone.
[00:17:13.018 --> 00:17:13.558]  That was it.
[00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:14.799]  Your election was done.
[00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:18.581]  They had control for another four years, eight years, forever, probably.
[00:17:19.421 --> 00:17:20.382]  They had control.
[00:17:20.842 --> 00:17:26.205]  The fact that he's lived, I then think, what lengths will they go to?
[00:17:26.885 --> 00:17:27.806]  They don't care.
[00:17:28.606 --> 00:17:31.888]  When you look at their world view and what they orchestrate,
[00:17:32.168 --> 00:17:34.869]  They don't care that half a million Ukrainian men are dead.
[00:17:35.109 --> 00:17:36.149]  They don't care.
[00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:37.349]  There's not a bat in their eye.
[00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:38.430]  They do not give a shit.
[00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.950]  So they won't care.
[00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:49.193]  Taking out Donald Trump to keep control, taking out Elon Musk, my biggest worry now, and it is a real worry, the only, if we didn't have X,
[00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.951]  If we didn't have X, we're reaching no one.
[00:17:52.512 --> 00:17:59.736]  The public would be totally controllable by their weaponised media where they push their narrative and no other voice is allowed.
[00:17:59.997 --> 00:18:03.319]  People realise this with Covid, over the vaccines, over everything.
[00:18:03.359 --> 00:18:10.424]  People realise, when we were getting, when you was labelled a conspiracy theorist, it was alright, it was okay when Alex Jones was getting.
[00:18:11.144 --> 00:18:11.585]  Silence.
[00:18:11.845 --> 00:18:15.769]  When Tommy Robinson, when he talks about immigration, so it's alright that he's getting silence.
[00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:22.857]  The mass awakening that's happened in the last few years has happened because they started silencing doctors, nurses and scientists.
[00:18:23.358 --> 00:18:25.480]  And that made a lot of people go, hold on a minute, yeah?
[00:18:25.981 --> 00:18:27.702]  These aren't thugs, these aren't crazy people.
[00:18:28.003 --> 00:18:32.206]  You see, they've built an image of you and they've built a successful image of me.
[00:18:32.626 --> 00:18:37.329]  And that's a very pre-planned, a lot of money's gone into it, a lot of propaganda's gone into it.
[00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.831]  They have indoctrinated the population of who we are.
[00:18:40.132 --> 00:18:42.894]  People hate me and they don't even know why they hate me.
[00:18:43.454 --> 00:18:45.516]  If I've had it, I've had it in the street.
[00:18:45.776 --> 00:18:47.957]  I say, what is it I say that you disagree with?
[00:18:49.258 --> 00:18:49.819]  You're racist!
[00:18:50.856 --> 00:18:51.757]  How am I racist?
[00:18:51.817 --> 00:18:52.578]  What have I said?
[00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.140]  They don't even know.
[00:18:54.981 --> 00:18:57.123]  That's the weaponisation of the media.
[00:18:57.604 --> 00:19:00.347]  Luckily, Alex, you are reaching the public.
[00:19:00.627 --> 00:19:05.213]  People are sitting hearing who you are from you, rather than them telling people who you are.
[00:19:05.393 --> 00:19:06.695]  The same with me.
[00:19:06.735 --> 00:19:08.997]  They've had the monopoly to tell people who I am.
[00:19:09.278 --> 00:19:10.719]  The same I've sat today.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.963]  And I'll be honest, it's terrifying.
[00:19:14.424 --> 00:19:26.338]  I'm sitting watching the news, I'm seeing the most senior-ranking police officers in my country, the leading politicians who govern my nation, making up total lies to the entire population of things I've said.
[00:19:26.939 --> 00:19:27.860]  And I haven't said them!
[00:19:28.539 --> 00:19:29.860]  I've never said that!
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.480]  There's no evidence of that.
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.921]  They don't care about the evidence.
[00:19:33.141 --> 00:19:39.884]  They're either soaking up someone and whipping up the public, me as enemy number one, hoping someone finishes me off, yeah?
[00:19:40.244 --> 00:19:45.146]  Or they're building up for the need to take Tommy Robinson off the streets to stop these riots.
[00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.892]  If you want to stop the riots, listen to the public!
[00:19:48.232 --> 00:19:49.313]  Address the concerns!
[00:19:49.753 --> 00:19:51.735]  British people are fearful!
[00:19:51.755 --> 00:19:52.356]  They're angry!
[00:19:52.536 --> 00:19:53.277]  But you're not!
[00:19:53.297 --> 00:19:55.298]  You're just coming down with a gun.
[00:19:55.358 --> 00:19:56.259]  I totally agree.
[00:19:56.319 --> 00:19:57.320]  Listen, you're a tough guy.
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:02.405]  You've faced the fake charges, served years in solitary confinement for nothing.
[00:20:02.425 --> 00:20:04.827]  People haven't followed the case like most of us have.
[00:20:05.388 --> 00:20:07.569]  But I'm asking you for everybody, we need your voice.
[00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.671]  You need to stay in Europe.
[00:20:10.212 --> 00:20:10.812]  You need to...
[00:20:11.573 --> 00:20:14.955]  You need, I know they basically tried to throw you out of Canada when you came to visit.
[00:20:15.455 --> 00:20:16.976]  I wish we could get you into the United States.
[00:20:17.056 --> 00:20:18.356]  I mean, just get to Mexico.
[00:20:18.456 --> 00:20:20.097]  Listen, get to Mexico.
[00:20:20.197 --> 00:20:20.997]  I'll bring you across.
[00:20:21.077 --> 00:20:23.459]  I mean, I've had enough of this.
[00:20:23.799 --> 00:20:25.079]  You're a true asylum seeker.
[00:20:25.139 --> 00:20:28.201]  You should come here and call for political asylum right now.
[00:20:29.955 --> 00:20:30.655]  Alex, I can't.
[00:20:31.016 --> 00:20:32.477]  Legally, I'm not allowed to in America.
[00:20:32.957 --> 00:20:36.099]  I've unlawfully... I went to... Did I tell you this the other day?
[00:20:36.599 --> 00:20:39.841]  I went to Cuba and I went to the Bahamas.
[00:20:40.181 --> 00:20:49.686]  So, when I knew, two years ago, when the film was leaked, and I thought they were going to come for me, I thought, where's the one place in the world that has a protection for freedom of speech?
[00:20:49.926 --> 00:20:53.929]  Where's the one place that I can go as a journalist and actually have protection?
[00:20:54.369 --> 00:20:56.731]  It's the United States of America, because of your constitution.
[00:20:56.771 --> 00:20:57.812]  There's nowhere else on the planet.
[00:20:58.092 --> 00:20:59.693]  There is no free speech anywhere else.
[00:21:00.234 --> 00:21:02.996]  Free speech, we live in a post-free speech era in Europe.
[00:21:03.276 --> 00:21:04.097]  It's pretend.
[00:21:04.357 --> 00:21:05.758]  It's a facade.
[00:21:06.038 --> 00:21:07.179]  There's no free speech.
[00:21:07.419 --> 00:21:11.722]  You think you've got freedom of speech until you actually try using it against any of the narratives.
[00:21:11.943 --> 00:21:15.385]  So I started looking, and I was going to make a documentary.
[00:21:15.725 --> 00:21:16.866]  I kissed my family goodbye.
[00:21:17.167 --> 00:21:21.370]  I said, I'm going to see how easy it is to get into the United States of America.
[00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:27.594]  And within 48 hours, I found people and connections for $10,000 that would bring me in from the Bahamas.
[00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:32.318]  Do you know when I went there and I sat down in the Bahamas, do you know all the people coming in?
[00:21:32.678 --> 00:21:33.799]  They were white Irish.
[00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:35.880]  They were white Irish sitting on the boats.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:49.109]  I actually went there and went up there and then when I'm sitting in the Bahamas, I was there three weeks, I'm sitting in the Bahamas not knowing what to do and I'm sitting there and then I was looking out and I got a lawyer from New York, a friend helped me get a lawyer.
[00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.271]  And the lawyer looked at my criminal record
[00:21:51.651 --> 00:21:52.152]  I don't know.
[00:22:10.569 --> 00:22:14.213]  What we need is, when Trump gets in, he needs to obviously, you know,
[00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:26.666]  What do I expect to happen?
[00:22:50.587 --> 00:22:54.648]  Next weekend I expect to be, that's what I said, who knows what's going to happen currently.
[00:22:55.008 --> 00:22:55.569]  I don't know.
[00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:57.789]  I'm sitting here thinking, you're all calling me out.
[00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:59.450]  Like, they're all calling me out.
[00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:06.752]  If I go back to the UK, if I go back to the UK, I will lead the biggest march that country's ever seen.
[00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:07.252]  Okay?
[00:23:07.612 --> 00:23:08.833]  The country is ready.
[00:23:09.293 --> 00:23:10.493]  The people are ready.
[00:23:10.773 --> 00:23:10.953]  Yeah?
[00:23:11.274 --> 00:23:12.394]  They're trying to crush it.
[00:23:12.854 --> 00:23:18.656]  So, but at the minute, my biggest plan at the minute is I have
[00:23:19.722 --> 00:23:22.063]  I have the film, which is pinned on my Twitter.
[00:23:22.523 --> 00:23:24.263]  I have part two with Jordan Peterson.
[00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:29.865]  I have four or five other big people lined up to sit down and tell my story.
[00:23:30.225 --> 00:23:33.326]  Because the reality is, I think when I land back in the UK, I'll be gone.
[00:23:33.846 --> 00:23:35.006]  I'll be taken off the streets.
[00:23:35.426 --> 00:23:41.728]  So I want to tell my story enough, get the message out there, make sure I've got enough people watching that film.
[00:23:41.948 --> 00:23:44.409]  The film's on 32 million views, possibly 33 by now.
[00:23:45.825 --> 00:23:49.806]  That will double with what's coming when I go back to the UK, yeah?
[00:23:49.866 --> 00:23:57.389]  That film, I believe, is powerful enough to destroy the corrupt judiciary in the public's eyes.
[00:23:57.709 --> 00:24:02.471]  So no longer can they justify that he was convicted in the High Court.
[00:24:02.871 --> 00:24:09.713]  Because no one will trust the convictions of your High Court because of the blatant corruption I prove in the documentary.
[00:24:09.853 --> 00:24:11.694]  Just like what we've all seen with Trump, absolutely.
[00:24:11.774 --> 00:24:13.715]  So, in the meantime,
[00:24:14.716 --> 00:24:16.237]  You expect things to cool off?
[00:24:16.277 --> 00:24:18.339]  What do you expect the corrupt Prime Minister to do?
[00:24:20.141 --> 00:24:21.162]  I expect them to come for me.
[00:24:21.742 --> 00:24:24.785]  All of this has been built up and used to justify silencing me.
[00:24:25.065 --> 00:24:26.967]  They are coming for everyone's freedom of speech.
[00:24:27.247 --> 00:24:28.748]  So this is all built up, yeah?
[00:24:28.988 --> 00:24:29.589]  They're built up.
[00:24:29.849 --> 00:24:30.870]  They allowed Alex.
[00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.772]  And they will set the precedent with you, just like they did with me.
[00:24:33.853 --> 00:24:36.475]  And when people don't stand up for you, they will silence everybody.
[00:24:37.881 --> 00:24:40.702]  If you look, Alex, at these riots, yeah, look at them.
[00:24:41.063 --> 00:24:43.164]  There's a lot of them I believe have been infiltrated.
[00:24:43.504 --> 00:24:46.405]  The police literally stood back and let them burn buildings.
[00:24:46.845 --> 00:24:58.131]  I believe the way they provoked the Muslim community by saying it was the EDL, hope not hate put out, hope not hate who are an NGO for the government, they put out saying Muslim women have been attacked.
[00:24:59.051 --> 00:25:01.355]  That provoked all the Muslims to come out violently.
[00:25:01.696 --> 00:25:02.998]  They've let this happen.
[00:25:03.278 --> 00:25:04.300]  They actually marched.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:09.608]  There's videos of the police bringing about a thousand young Muslim men from the Muslim community.
[00:25:09.628 --> 00:25:11.131]  They marched and they didn't try and stop them.
[00:25:11.778 --> 00:25:14.799]  They marched them to where the Patriotic Rally was, and all hell's gone on.
[00:25:15.059 --> 00:25:16.680]  They purposely orchestrated it.
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:23.602]  I believe they've done that to have the four or five days of riots, to then come in and say, right, we need more legislation.
[00:25:23.862 --> 00:25:25.923]  We need to control the internet.
[00:25:26.043 --> 00:25:29.945]  We need to control X. He needs to be silenced, which is what they're all parroting now.
[00:25:30.245 --> 00:25:31.145]  It's coming from everywhere.
[00:25:31.713 --> 00:25:33.394]  Yeah, they've let the violence flow.
[00:25:33.594 --> 00:25:34.554]  They could have stopped it.
[00:25:34.734 --> 00:25:35.555]  They didn't stop it.
[00:25:35.755 --> 00:25:37.736]  They've come down double hard.
[00:25:38.176 --> 00:25:44.339]  Keir Starmer has purposely provoked the entire country to bring about this violent conflict.
[00:25:44.859 --> 00:25:45.700]  You're totally right.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.261]  I mean, that's what the British intelligence would do and the British Army.
[00:25:48.841 --> 00:25:58.347]  For a hundred years in Northern Ireland, it came out almost every time that the actual violent IRA leaders were double agents of MI6 and before that British Intelligence.
[00:25:59.128 --> 00:26:01.109]  Winston Churchill was running them famously.
[00:26:01.129 --> 00:26:04.771]  There's even famous documentaries made about it and even made for TV movies.
[00:26:05.912 --> 00:26:07.152]  The Pinky Blinders.
[00:26:07.192 --> 00:26:09.054]  That's actually a true story, most of that.
[00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:11.575]  So they do this over and over again.
[00:26:11.695 --> 00:26:12.096]  Exactly.
[00:26:12.396 --> 00:26:15.838]  There's no doubt they're trying to stir this up so they can have a clampdown.
[00:26:18.263 --> 00:26:21.524]  Yeah, clamp down, total clamp down on speech, on online speech.
[00:26:21.584 --> 00:26:22.725]  They're saying all of this.
[00:26:22.785 --> 00:26:23.805]  It hasn't been instigated.
[00:26:23.885 --> 00:26:27.086]  It was instigated from the streets and the estates, from locals.
[00:26:27.386 --> 00:26:33.448]  But they want to try and create this image that it's been controlled by online influencers like myself.
[00:26:33.788 --> 00:26:34.669]  So then they can come in.
[00:26:34.989 --> 00:26:41.491]  They need to get rid of the online influencers like myself, so then they can continue with their crimes and open borders and no one can talk about it.
[00:26:41.771 --> 00:26:42.011]  Absolutely.
[00:26:42.031 --> 00:26:44.012]  No one understands the reality of the problems they're coming from.
[00:26:44.292 --> 00:26:45.472]  In closing, we only have a minute.
[00:26:47.614 --> 00:26:49.415]  In closing, we only have a minute left.
[00:26:49.455 --> 00:26:50.436]  How do people support you?
[00:26:50.476 --> 00:26:51.436]  How do they follow you on X?
[00:26:53.558 --> 00:26:56.099]  So I have multiple legal face battles now.
[00:26:56.119 --> 00:26:58.280]  I have legal battles to prevent the two year imprisonment.
[00:26:58.661 --> 00:27:01.522]  I believe I'm on bail for terrorism insanely.
[00:27:01.682 --> 00:27:02.843]  Yes, but nothing.
[00:27:03.123 --> 00:27:03.423]  Okay.
[00:27:03.663 --> 00:27:09.267]  And I, and now I believe they're going to come for me after this Cobra meeting today to limit my speech.
[00:27:09.307 --> 00:27:11.068]  So you can support me at help Tommy
[00:27:12.513 --> 00:27:14.416]  That goes towards our work in journalism.
[00:27:14.636 --> 00:27:15.657]  We've still got a lot on the go.
[00:27:15.677 --> 00:27:17.620]  I appreciate everyone's support.
[00:27:18.141 --> 00:27:20.604]  None of us would be able to do this without people helping out.
[00:27:20.624 --> 00:27:21.105]  Do you know what?
[00:27:21.445 --> 00:27:23.408]  I've got moves now.
[00:27:23.608 --> 00:27:26.132]  I've gone away with not just my children, but other children.
[00:27:26.472 --> 00:27:27.093]  We've got a lead.
[00:27:27.133 --> 00:27:28.495]  That's what I've been sorting out all day today.
[00:27:29.252 --> 00:27:33.316]  We're three days into a two-week break with my kids.
[00:27:33.556 --> 00:27:34.077]  We've got to go!
[00:27:34.157 --> 00:27:42.285]  And again, Tommy, the COBRA meeting is the national security national emergency meeting all over the emergency the government created.
[00:27:42.345 --> 00:27:43.166]  Tommy, Godspeed.
[00:27:43.186 --> 00:27:44.187]  We'll stay in contact.
[00:27:44.487 --> 00:27:47.169]  I'll be reposting everything you post on your account at Rolex Jones.
[00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:48.210]  And we're with you, brother.
[00:27:48.391 --> 00:27:49.912]  So let's stay in contact and Godspeed.
[00:27:51.854 --> 00:27:52.214]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:27:52.334 --> 00:27:52.795]  See you later, man.
[00:27:53.015 --> 00:27:53.235]  Cheers.
[00:27:54.326 --> 00:27:59.629]  So, there's the InfoWars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:27:59.789 --> 00:28:07.154]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's salt palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[00:28:07.594 --> 00:28:11.236]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[00:28:11.297 --> 00:28:12.557]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[00:28:12.577 --> 00:28:22.644]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWars MD.
[00:28:24.304 --> 00:28:27.507]  It's 1133 Central Standard Time, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:28:27.527 --> 00:28:30.069]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we're in an emergency situation.
[00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:38.917]  The day Trump was shot on the 13th of July, I went on air and I said they're going to trigger global civil unrest, stock market crashes.
[00:28:40.393 --> 00:28:41.473]  A new virus?
[00:28:42.254 --> 00:28:43.094]  Expanded war?
[00:28:43.214 --> 00:28:58.819]  Look, it's all there because I know the enemy playbook, and the globalists are losing power all over the world, and their global bubble is coming to an end, and they're behind schedule getting their central bank digital currencies in, and their ESG social credit scores.
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:04.201]  And so they need crises, and their own playbooks that are public, they say they will use these crises.
[00:29:04.241 --> 00:29:06.062]  So, studying them for 40 years.
[00:29:07.415 --> 00:29:07.875]  It's on air for 30.
[00:29:08.916 --> 00:29:09.677]  I've got their number.
[00:29:09.697 --> 00:29:16.942]  I don't know exactly what card they're going to play, but I know what cards they've got in their hand, and it's pretty easy to know what they're going to play and when they're going to play it.
[00:29:17.702 --> 00:29:19.904]  So, I've been harping on this.
[00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:24.066]  Here's a few clips of the last three weeks where I called it all.
[00:29:24.106 --> 00:29:24.487]  Here it is.
[00:29:25.447 --> 00:29:27.789]  And do you think the system's going to back down now?
[00:29:28.169 --> 00:29:28.369]  No.
[00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:33.673]  Power outages, cyber attacks, expanded war, China invading Taiwan.
[00:29:35.277 --> 00:29:36.137]  Stock market crash.
[00:29:36.678 --> 00:29:38.939]  It's all on the table, and the deep state's behind it.
[00:29:39.239 --> 00:29:43.981]  I'll be covering it live, coming up on X at Real Alex Jones.
[00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:45.482]  Trump will get 70% of voters.
[00:29:47.002 --> 00:29:50.404]  And that's why he's in even greater danger now.
[00:29:50.424 --> 00:30:04.590]  And I just keep harping on the scenarios of how they would do it and how they would change the subject right after they did it, which is a huge war expansion, a stock market crash, a cyber attack that knocks half the country's power off.
[00:30:05.206 --> 00:30:07.668]  Those are things that are not possibilities now.
[00:30:08.168 --> 00:30:09.269]  It is a probability.
[00:30:09.809 --> 00:30:12.571]  It's very easy to kill people, especially when you're on their security.
[00:30:14.512 --> 00:30:18.414]  Oh, they're definitely, Trump has said like five times, they go, oh, Trump wants a crash.
[00:30:18.434 --> 00:30:20.796]  He goes, no, the crash is looming.
[00:30:20.936 --> 00:30:24.018]  I hope it happens before I get elected because he could turn it around.
[00:30:24.918 --> 00:30:27.580]  But, but if he, he knows how the public's mind works.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.501]  He gets it, they crash it completely, announce it's crashed.
[00:30:30.521 --> 00:30:31.862]  They'll have real trouble fixing it.
[00:30:31.882 --> 00:30:32.543]  It'll be Herbert Hoover.
[00:30:33.564 --> 00:30:35.946]  If they know we're not going to buy it, they won't do it.
[00:30:35.986 --> 00:30:37.948]  They'll probably wait until Trump gets in.
[00:30:38.889 --> 00:30:40.250]  This, I think, is the most probable thing.
[00:30:40.711 --> 00:30:43.773]  And they're going to deep six the stock market and the dollar and blame Trump.
[00:30:44.014 --> 00:30:44.954]  And he's Herbert Hoover 2.0.
[00:30:45.675 --> 00:30:46.376]  And Trump has said that.
[00:30:46.396 --> 00:30:47.136]  I agree with him.
[00:30:48.237 --> 00:30:49.418]  He didn't say he hopes there's a crash.
[00:30:49.458 --> 00:30:51.600]  He says, I wish we didn't have this economic problem.
[00:30:51.861 --> 00:30:55.284]  But if there is a crash, I want it to happen now so I don't get the blame, I can fix it.
[00:30:56.425 --> 00:30:59.788]  But if they do it, not while he's president-elect,
[00:31:01.032 --> 00:31:08.796]  But once he's in, in January next year... And so there I am, wargaming different scenarios.
[00:31:09.116 --> 00:31:14.498]  This could clearly be, and I think it is, Buffett cashing out, the big boys protecting themselves.
[00:31:15.038 --> 00:31:21.781]  Then they do a plunge protection team out of the President's Office on Market Stability, prop it up, but getting us ready for it.
[00:31:21.942 --> 00:31:23.242]  Or this could be it.
[00:31:24.503 --> 00:31:29.065]  Many, many different angles to all of this, changing the subject from the attempted assassination
[00:31:30.578 --> 00:31:32.139]  Moving us into the crises.
[00:31:32.179 --> 00:31:34.360]  Report Israel could preemptively strike Iran.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.380]  Intelligence shows attack is imminent.
[00:31:36.881 --> 00:31:41.683]  They're saying Iran is set to launch a new giant barrage after the two leaders of Hamas were killed.
[00:31:42.566 --> 00:31:45.207]  One in Iran and one in Lebanon.
[00:31:46.368 --> 00:31:48.669]  It's all happening right now.
[00:31:48.729 --> 00:31:50.649]  The Chinese are threatening to invade Taiwan.
[00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:52.250]  They've already run blockades.
[00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:58.073]  But I wanted to get Dr. Kirk Elliott on, a really smart economist and a friend of ours and a sponsor of the show.
[00:31:58.093 --> 00:32:02.254]  He's the best place to get silver and gold, has the top ratings.
[00:32:02.835 --> 00:32:08.197]  But I wanted to get him on because it's obvious to me, when Warren Buffett dropped, dumped,
[00:32:09.335 --> 00:32:11.536]  Or dropped.
[00:32:11.556 --> 00:32:17.218]  55% of his stock in the number one stock in the world at the time, Apple, that was calling the top.
[00:32:18.279 --> 00:32:20.100]  But that's how he's the Oracle of Omaha.
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.921]  He's been doing that for 40, 50 years.
[00:32:22.601 --> 00:32:25.482]  He represents the big insiders, folks, on record.
[00:32:26.162 --> 00:32:31.645]  They're the largest owner, Berkshire Hathaway, of the BlackRock family in Vanguard and State Street.
[00:32:32.876 --> 00:32:37.880]  The largest holder in Bank of America, that literally is a Rothschild-slash-Vatican bank.
[00:32:38.041 --> 00:32:40.022]  So, they're positioning themselves.
[00:32:40.102 --> 00:32:46.748]  I don't know if the total crash is this week, or in January, or February of next year, but this is clearly pre-positioning.
[00:32:46.768 --> 00:32:51.452]  Then they shut down a bunch of the stock trading, so the insiders could do their selling, but other people couldn't.
[00:32:51.793 --> 00:32:52.793]  That happens every time.
[00:32:53.394 --> 00:32:55.296]  This, to me, is as phony as a $3 bill.
[00:32:55.356 --> 00:32:56.377]  Global market crash.
[00:32:58.444 --> 00:33:00.549]  From Asia markets to crypto prices, U.S.
[00:33:00.589 --> 00:33:02.975]  recession fears jolt financial markets globally.
[00:33:03.616 --> 00:33:05.540]  Apple shares dropped up to 7 percent.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.046]  5 to 7 percent has been gyrating.
[00:33:09.431 --> 00:33:11.092]  We've got headlines here, breaking U.S.
[00:33:11.112 --> 00:33:16.736]  Fed calls, emergency meeting as Japan market collapses, global stock market meltdown as fears grow of U.S.
[00:33:17.676 --> 00:33:18.597]  economy will collapse.
[00:33:18.637 --> 00:33:19.838]  And I want to say something about silver and gold.
[00:33:19.858 --> 00:33:23.640]  I'm not an economist, but I've been watching this for decades, 30 plus years.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.703]  You notice crypto's way down and everything else is way down compared to silver and gold.
[00:33:28.043 --> 00:33:30.825]  Silver and gold had a little bit of a dip, but nothing compared to those.
[00:33:31.665 --> 00:33:43.194]  And what I watch is how the big banks and the globalists and the ultra-rich, from Mark Zuckerberg to Buffett, have been grabbing silver and gold, and how the Chinese and other big governments and institutions are.
[00:33:43.234 --> 00:33:48.338]  So we'll talk some about that at the end of the hour, but I want to plunge right now, Kirk, because we haven't talked until you just came on.
[00:33:48.358 --> 00:33:49.899]  I don't know your view yet.
[00:33:49.919 --> 00:33:52.220]  Do you agree with me, or is there some nuance to that?
[00:33:52.361 --> 00:33:55.283]  Because for me, this is pure insider trading on its face.
[00:33:56.684 --> 00:33:58.246]  Well, I do agree with you.
[00:33:59.847 --> 00:34:07.836]  So when you look at what Warren Buffett did, Alex, it's like, so you look at the last 14 days, he dumped $3.8 billion worth of Bank of America.
[00:34:11.061 --> 00:34:15.304]  And then on Friday, he dumps half of his Apple position.
[00:34:15.324 --> 00:34:17.646]  It's like over $50 billion worth of Apple.
[00:34:18.227 --> 00:34:19.988]  So what is Warren Buffett doing now?
[00:34:20.028 --> 00:34:20.669]  What is he saying?
[00:34:20.729 --> 00:34:22.350]  What is he doing by his actions?
[00:34:22.931 --> 00:34:25.633]  He doesn't believe that the markets are going to do well.
[00:34:25.673 --> 00:34:26.874]  I mean, he's called it.
[00:34:26.914 --> 00:34:28.415]  He's the Oracle of Omaha, right?
[00:34:28.435 --> 00:34:30.817]  It's like he's not some kind of a soothsayer.
[00:34:30.857 --> 00:34:32.098]  He's not a prophet, right?
[00:34:32.138 --> 00:34:35.641]  But he sees what's coming probably because he knows.
[00:34:36.201 --> 00:34:44.614]  I mean, when you're that much of a billionaire, like one of the wealthiest... Well, he just pulled $240-plus billion out in the last week from the stock market.
[00:34:45.034 --> 00:34:47.098]  He's not predicting it, he's causing it!
[00:34:48.257 --> 00:34:49.458]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:49.559 --> 00:34:56.506]  So, when you're that big, every action that you do has a consequence because people are listening, right?
[00:34:56.567 --> 00:35:02.093]  So, he's now sitting on $277 billion worth of cash.
[00:35:02.113 --> 00:35:05.337]  I mean, this is a massive amount of cash that he's sitting on, right?
[00:35:05.377 --> 00:35:05.677]  So, why?
[00:35:06.698 --> 00:35:12.980]  Why, if you're that smart, and you think that the markets are going to go up, then you hold on to the stuff.
[00:35:13.401 --> 00:35:22.624]  But if you think that they're going to come down, either because the markets are so bad or some external force, or because you're going to do something that would cause it to come down,
[00:35:23.104 --> 00:35:25.526]  Well, then you would get out because you want to get out of Dodge.
[00:35:25.946 --> 00:35:33.130]  So when you look at the rationale of Warren Buffett, he is a he's a value investor, meaning he likes to buy companies at a discount.
[00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:39.634]  So by his own actions now, because he's so big or some external force, the markets are coming down now.
[00:35:40.674 --> 00:35:44.035]  He had to have known about this, because Apple he got rid of.
[00:35:44.295 --> 00:35:45.576]  So what does he not believe in?
[00:35:45.916 --> 00:35:46.156]  Apple.
[00:35:46.316 --> 00:35:47.736]  He doesn't believe in tech stocks.
[00:35:48.096 --> 00:35:50.317]  He doesn't believe in the banking system right now.
[00:35:50.397 --> 00:35:56.219]  So if you're an American investor, what else do we have left outside of tech and bank stocks?
[00:35:56.239 --> 00:36:05.221]  You know, most of our manufacturing has been outsourced to China and Asia and other parts of the world during the Biden administration and other administrations.
[00:36:05.281 --> 00:36:06.722]  So it's like, what's left?
[00:36:07.242 --> 00:36:07.422]  Right.
[00:36:07.462 --> 00:36:10.784]  The two biggest markets are come collapsing down.
[00:36:11.364 --> 00:36:20.868]  So to me, Alex, the day, literally the business day before the Japan banks bailed.
[00:36:20.888 --> 00:36:22.829]  I mean, he was out.
[00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:24.549]  That doesn't make sense to me.
[00:36:24.609 --> 00:36:27.631]  So this thing that happened in Japan,
[00:36:28.411 --> 00:36:29.392]  is massive.
[00:36:29.473 --> 00:36:32.336]  And I think that Warren Buffett knew what was coming.
[00:36:32.396 --> 00:36:32.596]  Right.
[00:36:32.697 --> 00:36:35.380]  And but he's not some kind of a magician.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.341]  You know why?
[00:36:36.361 --> 00:36:38.744]  Because you and I knew that this was coming, too.
[00:36:39.084 --> 00:36:41.087]  We've talked about this for like half a year.
[00:36:41.527 --> 00:36:46.514]  And this is why we when we say these things, they're they're built beyond beyond.
[00:36:46.934 --> 00:36:53.080]  With logic and certainty and confidence and knowing there are consequences to actions.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:37:04.030]  And when you start to raise interest rates like what Japan did and a really, really, really soft faltering economy, it's going to kill everything.
[00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:09.235]  So so let's look at what what Japan did, Alex, because for since the 1980s,
[00:37:10.896 --> 00:37:12.296]  Literally, this has been a long time.
[00:37:12.777 --> 00:37:14.457]  They've defied the system.
[00:37:14.777 --> 00:37:19.398]  They've been keeping rates artificially low to keep the Japanese economy up.
[00:37:19.799 --> 00:37:20.639]  So what does that mean?
[00:37:20.839 --> 00:37:22.459]  People spend money that they don't have.
[00:37:22.499 --> 00:37:31.542]  They have multi-generation loans in Japan because 30 years isn't long enough for a mortgage in Japan because the prices were so high in Tokyo.
[00:37:32.122 --> 00:37:32.382]  Right.
[00:37:32.402 --> 00:37:36.124]  So so they've got multi generation loans dead up to their eyeballs.
[00:37:36.164 --> 00:37:40.326]  That's why they've had to keep rates artificially low for the longest time.
[00:37:40.766 --> 00:37:48.851]  Well now like what we've talked about in America and other parts of the world you get to the breaking point where inflation is so much.
[00:37:49.671 --> 00:37:54.735]  Right that you have to raise interest rates to slow down inflation because people can't afford to live.
[00:37:55.216 --> 00:38:02.762]  Here's the calculated risk that they took that absolutely flopped intended to flop or by mistake it flopped.
[00:38:02.942 --> 00:38:03.743]  We don't know.
[00:38:04.223 --> 00:38:07.746]  But markets are reeling all over the world.
[00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:08.526]  Right.
[00:38:08.586 --> 00:38:14.608]  So like what you had on the screen just there, the Fed is going to possibly have an emergency meeting.
[00:38:14.988 --> 00:38:16.929]  What are we going to do about interest rates?
[00:38:17.089 --> 00:38:18.209]  What are we going to do?
[00:38:18.509 --> 00:38:24.811]  Because what happened to Japan is now causing a massive domino effect all over the world.
[00:38:24.851 --> 00:38:28.132]  So let me let me explain kind of a little bit what happened here.
[00:38:28.812 --> 00:38:38.798]  When Japan raised rates to save the yen, they had to raise rates to save the yen during an economic downturn with massive debt in Japan.
[00:38:39.179 --> 00:38:40.519]  Alex, they have massive debt.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.061]  It created a global domino effect.
[00:38:43.161 --> 00:38:45.943]  Banks are losing money fast in Japan.
[00:38:46.343 --> 00:38:49.085]  Now banks are losing money fast in America.
[00:38:50.165 --> 00:39:11.395]  And stop there, stop there, and I'll give you the floor, Dr. Elliot, but let's be clear, you've been on the show now for almost 10 months, and you've been harping on it every time you come on, at least once a week, that already regional banks are in big trouble, already everything's totally leveraged, and once you start failing again, which is now beginning, you said, we don't know if it's going to pop up in Europe, or Japan, or China, or here, but wherever it pops up, it's a contagion, and then it's going to move quickly.
[00:39:11.676 --> 00:39:18.579]  So you made all those predictions, it's now here, the contagion's moving quickly, best case scenario, how bad will it be, versus worst case, what are the scenarios?
[00:39:21.389 --> 00:39:23.030]  I think this is going to be a bad one.
[00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:31.275]  What we're seeing in Japan is the biggest sell off on their stock market like ever, like literally ever.
[00:39:31.736 --> 00:39:33.237]  This is this is a doozy.
[00:39:33.597 --> 00:39:44.364]  You look at certain certain indexes, the volatility index, the only two times in history that it's been worse than it is right now is in COVID in 2020 and during 2008-2009 crisis.
[00:39:48.066 --> 00:39:48.486]  That's it.
[00:39:48.847 --> 00:39:50.988]  So this is a big one but it's just beginning.
[00:39:51.028 --> 00:39:52.329]  We're one day into this.
[00:39:52.409 --> 00:39:52.630]  Right.
[00:39:52.690 --> 00:40:04.899]  So so the contagion that's coming I think we could see I don't know 50 percent market correction in normal equities and bonds because what happened in Japan which this is where the domino effect gets worse.
[00:40:05.039 --> 00:40:06.320]  It's like this snowball.
[00:40:06.981 --> 00:40:10.644]  Their stock market officially is in correction territory.
[00:40:11.164 --> 00:40:11.344]  Right.
[00:40:11.364 --> 00:40:13.486]  They had to raise rates to save the yen.
[00:40:13.846 --> 00:40:16.448]  So when they do that, people can't afford to live.
[00:40:16.508 --> 00:40:17.709]  They're going to stop spending.
[00:40:17.769 --> 00:40:19.210]  They're going to stop investing.
[00:40:19.611 --> 00:40:22.153]  And you know what that massive sell-off is going to kill?
[00:40:22.793 --> 00:40:24.815]  Companies like Nvidia, right?
[00:40:24.955 --> 00:40:29.979]  Goodbye, Nvidia and tech stocks and bank stocks that are already in correction mode.
[00:40:30.339 --> 00:40:37.525]  So this is probably why Warren Buffett, thinking, OK, I know what's going to happen in Japan, starts getting rid of tech stocks.
[00:40:37.785 --> 00:40:39.347]  And he starts to get rid of banking.
[00:40:39.588 --> 00:40:43.614]  Because when you raise those interest rates, that's not necessarily a profit center for banks.
[00:40:43.634 --> 00:40:45.096]  And that's where you've been predicting.
[00:40:45.236 --> 00:40:47.379]  You said it's going to start in banks and go into tech.
[00:40:47.719 --> 00:40:52.607]  And it's already started in banks, but it looks like it actually, the real blow up is in tech now going into banks.
[00:40:54.073 --> 00:40:55.033]  Well, absolutely.
[00:40:55.093 --> 00:41:07.358]  And it's actually a little bit farther than tech and banks, because we're seeing massive bank failures, 6%, 10%, 20% a day corrections, a day over the weekend in bank stocks in Japan.
[00:41:07.878 --> 00:41:11.019]  Now you've got the S&P 500 down like 4%.
[00:41:11.079 --> 00:41:12.780]  The Dow is collapsing.
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:18.022]  You've got all this major bank failures in regional banks again in America, because
[00:41:18.622 --> 00:41:23.304]  When Japan raised rates, there's going to be a competitive devaluation across the globe.
[00:41:23.724 --> 00:41:26.126]  Now you're going to say, America has this tendency.
[00:41:26.186 --> 00:41:28.006]  We've got to raise rates to keep up with them.
[00:41:28.247 --> 00:41:32.068]  But no, we can't raise rates to keep up with them because they rose rates.
[00:41:32.128 --> 00:41:33.629]  That's what caused the markets to fail.
[00:41:33.649 --> 00:41:36.450]  So now they're going to have an emergency meeting to lower rates.
[00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:43.293]  But when they haven't killed the inflation beast and you lower interest rates, it's going to be devastating on the economy.
[00:41:43.414 --> 00:41:44.114]  Devastating.
[00:41:44.716 --> 00:41:48.379]  So, I mean, we're not oracles either, but we can see the trend lines.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:53.724]  So, I mean, again, best case, how bad is it going to be?
[00:41:53.764 --> 00:41:55.506]  Worst case, I agree, it's going to be a doozy.
[00:41:56.086 --> 00:41:57.047]  What's the timeline?
[00:41:57.067 --> 00:41:59.449]  Does this collapse before Trump gets in?
[00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.813]  Which, again, that's the best house in a bad neighborhood because then he won't get blamed.
[00:42:04.154 --> 00:42:08.437]  He's got some tactics that could be at least try to mitigate it from the experts and people I've talked to.
[00:42:08.898 --> 00:42:10.920]  Or can they prop this up until Trump gets in?
[00:42:12.921 --> 00:42:17.205]  So I could, sadly, I think the end result is inevitable.
[00:42:17.705 --> 00:42:19.146]  These things are going to fail.
[00:42:19.226 --> 00:42:20.608]  So here's our two strategies.
[00:42:21.068 --> 00:42:27.233]  You do it now to create so much panic, so much chaos, then bring a pandemic in sometime in the fall.
[00:42:27.674 --> 00:42:30.276]  So therefore, oh, we can't have people go to vote.
[00:42:30.296 --> 00:42:32.118]  We're going to have to do mail-in ballots, right?
[00:42:32.158 --> 00:42:32.558]  Exactly.
[00:42:32.598 --> 00:42:39.384]  They may be creating a crisis so bad with military crises on top of it, which is all here, and then they assassinate Trump.
[00:42:41.038 --> 00:42:42.379]  Well, they could, right?
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.462]  Because you're looking at— Oh, they're trying.
[00:42:44.602 --> 00:42:45.142]  I mean, don't worry.
[00:42:45.162 --> 00:42:50.047]  I mean, that's what I'm saying is, people need to understand, we cannot overemphasize the danger.
[00:42:50.127 --> 00:42:51.449]  And I'm just saying it because we need to be ready.
[00:42:52.049 --> 00:42:53.791]  And so, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:42:54.372 --> 00:42:55.273]  My family knows that.
[00:42:55.353 --> 00:42:56.114]  My crew knows that.
[00:42:56.194 --> 00:42:56.654]  You know that.
[00:42:56.954 --> 00:43:00.078]  But I wonder what the public's going to do when they figure out how bad this is.
[00:43:02.085 --> 00:43:04.126]  Well, they're going to give up their freedoms, Alex.
[00:43:04.146 --> 00:43:06.927]  That's what public usually does when it gets really bad.
[00:43:07.367 --> 00:43:08.947]  And so this is what I think is coming.
[00:43:08.987 --> 00:43:11.568]  So let's say that they assume that Trump is going to win the election.
[00:43:11.908 --> 00:43:13.468]  Then they hold off until after.
[00:43:13.508 --> 00:43:14.969]  They bring the pandemic after.
[00:43:15.409 --> 00:43:17.250]  So he has all this stuff to worry about.
[00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:19.930]  They kill the economy because he's holding the bag, right?
[00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:20.931]  I totally agree.
[00:43:21.311 --> 00:43:21.971]  They'll get the blame.
[00:43:22.671 --> 00:43:42.960]  So, so I could see it going either way, but, but bottom line is whether it's right now before the election or after the election, I think all of this stuff actually is, is like toast by middle of November, literally middle of November, because you've got the tenure note is down 60 basis points in one week.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.302]  The NASDAQ 100 is in correction territory.
[00:43:46.622 --> 00:43:50.924]  So what about this soft landing that the Biden administration keeps asking about?
[00:43:51.604 --> 00:43:57.771]  By the way, because I don't have the crew to do it, our crew is so small now, and we look for, you know, have your crew find it from all the interviews.
[00:43:58.472 --> 00:44:05.320]  You, like, said three months ago, I remember saying, when do you think the banks are going to start failing, or when do you think the big correction starts?
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.843]  And you said, you said, like, as early as August.
[00:44:08.023 --> 00:44:09.185]  You said that, and here we are.
[00:44:10.322 --> 00:44:11.282]  Yeah, I mean, we're right here.
[00:44:11.322 --> 00:44:13.203]  I mean, to me, it's not rocket science.
[00:44:13.243 --> 00:44:13.943]  It's what I do.
[00:44:14.003 --> 00:44:14.883]  It's what I look for.
[00:44:14.923 --> 00:44:20.364]  And when you've got capitalization issues, rising interest rates, delinquencies, defaults, it becomes a problem.
[00:44:20.745 --> 00:44:27.886]  But now here's where it's where people are really going to get hit hard in the tech world is Bitcoin and Ethereum.
[00:44:28.346 --> 00:44:31.647]  They're down like seven and nine percent today.
[00:44:32.047 --> 00:44:32.608]  Today.
[00:44:32.968 --> 00:44:33.148]  Right.
[00:44:33.188 --> 00:44:34.908]  Bitcoin is hovering close to 50,000.
[00:44:34.968 --> 00:44:36.629]  So in the last 60 minutes,
[00:44:39.249 --> 00:44:43.851]  $366 million was liquidated from the cryptocurrency market, right?
[00:44:43.892 --> 00:44:48.013]  These markets are falling and they're falling fast, right?
[00:44:48.114 --> 00:44:57.338]  When we're not talking about, in one day, Japan's largest bank, MFUG, the largest bank down 21% in one day.
[00:44:57.658 --> 00:45:00.019]  That would be the equivalent of like JPMorgan Chase.
[00:45:00.219 --> 00:45:01.340]  I mean, this is big.
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:13.575]  So, look at this, Alex, when you've got those kind of things happening, people are going to lose confidence, they're going to lose faith in what they've known, and they're going to beg for the government to fix things, right?
[00:45:13.656 --> 00:45:16.639]  So, here's where, how do you...
[00:45:18.875 --> 00:45:20.557]  Make this crash continue to go.
[00:45:20.597 --> 00:45:26.342]  So Marjorie Taylor Greene did a post this morning and it's simple.
[00:45:26.382 --> 00:45:31.547]  Your team can they just look up this website down detector dot com on the screen.
[00:45:32.348 --> 00:45:33.109]  And you know what.
[00:45:33.229 --> 00:45:34.610]  Who can't trade today.
[00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:37.233]  Who's trading platforms are shut down.
[00:45:37.653 --> 00:45:38.173]  E-Trade.
[00:45:38.634 --> 00:45:39.375]  Fidelity.
[00:45:40.135 --> 00:45:48.146]  Vanguard, Schwab, internet service providers like Lumen and... Yeah, that's the key.
[00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:55.295]  They've cut the... like they do every time, they did this 2008, they shut down the public from trading while the big boys sit there and do whatever they want.
[00:45:56.476 --> 00:45:59.378]  Yeah, even in our office today, the Internet's down.
[00:45:59.398 --> 00:46:01.679]  See, I can't do it from my normal studio.
[00:46:01.699 --> 00:46:03.420]  The Internet is down.
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:07.842]  And we called them and they said, well, it's a cooling, you know, some kind of an HVAC issue.
[00:46:07.862 --> 00:46:08.523]  It's like, what?
[00:46:08.603 --> 00:46:09.583]  Don't you have backups?
[00:46:09.963 --> 00:46:13.986]  But then I looked and Lumen, who does our Internet service, they're on there.
[00:46:14.266 --> 00:46:14.866]  They're down.
[00:46:15.206 --> 00:46:21.390]  So when people can't even get on the Internet, you can't blame it on E-Trade or Fidelity or TD Ameritrade or whatever.
[00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:25.092]  Like, this is this is a concerted effort.
[00:46:26.198 --> 00:46:26.918]  Coordinated.
[00:46:27.158 --> 00:46:28.259]  Absolutely coordinated.
[00:46:28.539 --> 00:46:30.660]  How does all of this stuff happen on the same day?
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:39.323]  How does it happen that Warren Buffett got rid of all of this stuff literally the trading day before the Japanese base failed?
[00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:39.923]  Exactly.
[00:46:39.943 --> 00:46:42.924]  I've talked to a bunch of top IT people and so has the crew.
[00:46:43.824 --> 00:46:45.405]  Renowned folks on air and off.
[00:46:45.945 --> 00:46:58.949]  They said that that software error by CrowdStrike and Microsoft was loading the new software for these takedowns into the internet for different types of economic cyber attacks for an economic collapse.
[00:46:59.069 --> 00:47:04.651]  I mean, Harrison Smith had a guy on a week ago, a top expert laying all this out, predicting it.
[00:47:04.711 --> 00:47:06.611]  I mean, this is so transparent.
[00:47:09.152 --> 00:47:10.612]  It's so transparent.
[00:47:10.632 --> 00:47:11.853]  I mean, we don't...
[00:47:13.392 --> 00:47:23.897]  We see in part now, and we're going to see fully pretty soon, but part of me wonders why in the world would Warren Buffett be sitting on $277 billion worth of cash?
[00:47:24.377 --> 00:47:25.777]  Where does he have that cash?
[00:47:26.198 --> 00:47:28.939]  Because banks are on the verge of failure, right?
[00:47:28.999 --> 00:47:33.861]  So this is why central banks around the world have been going into gold, into tangible assets,
[00:47:34.461 --> 00:47:41.022]  But when you have anything that's digital, anything that's crypto, it actually puts you in danger.
[00:47:41.102 --> 00:47:46.823]  So don't think that cryptocurrency is actually safe.
[00:47:46.943 --> 00:47:50.444]  People get the word privacy and safety mixed up all the time.
[00:47:51.004 --> 00:47:51.724]  Is it private?
[00:47:51.804 --> 00:47:53.065]  Sure, it can be private.
[00:47:53.185 --> 00:47:53.765]  Is it safe?
[00:47:53.945 --> 00:47:54.285]  Well, no.
[00:47:54.345 --> 00:47:55.705]  Look what's happening to it today.
[00:47:55.725 --> 00:47:59.246]  Well, I don't think people are bad to have some of it and make some money on it, but absolutely.
[00:48:00.646 --> 00:48:03.410]  Let's just do a straight up pitch at people because you're a great sponsor and a great economist.
[00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:07.034]  You've got the highest ratings out there for any silver broker in the world.
[00:48:07.455 --> 00:48:08.256]  You're the biggest now.
[00:48:08.276 --> 00:48:10.799]  You've been around 25 years, an overnight success story, 25 years.
[00:48:11.701 --> 00:48:17.989]  I can't even take any of these other gold sponsors that offer me five times the money you can pay me because they're ripping people off and they
[00:48:18.049 --> 00:48:20.150]  They go, I mean, literally five times the money.
[00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:24.012]  We'd have no financial problems here, except I'd be ripping the listeners off.
[00:48:24.052 --> 00:48:24.572]  I will not do it.
[00:48:24.992 --> 00:48:26.113]  It is a no-brainer.
[00:48:26.313 --> 00:48:32.376]  Everyone should call you and do a quick consultation and then start ordering the silver and gold bullion.
[00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:34.717]  And folks, it's set to the wholesale price.
[00:48:34.737 --> 00:48:35.918]  You know you're getting the best deal.
[00:48:36.198 --> 00:48:37.739]  There's no fake story behind it.
[00:48:38.499 --> 00:48:38.839]  I don't know.
[00:49:00.199 --> 00:49:01.420]  You know, this won't betray you.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.920]  Well, beyond that, it's silver and gold.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:13.504]  God gave us those medals to show us that there's order to the universe, and it's always going to have value, and it is the obvious safest bet in this insane world to call you now and not screw around.
[00:49:13.745 --> 00:49:15.205]  Tell people about the great services you have.
[00:49:15.225 --> 00:49:18.467]  Yeah, so, and I would call now.
[00:49:18.507 --> 00:49:18.727]  Why?
[00:49:18.767 --> 00:49:21.388]  Because gold and silver are down today, too, right?
[00:49:21.448 --> 00:49:23.929]  Across the board, every asset category is coming down.
[00:49:24.169 --> 00:49:24.769]  But not as much.
[00:49:24.789 --> 00:49:26.730]  But not as much, right.
[00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:29.131]  But that's an opportunity to buy it.
[00:49:30.353 --> 00:49:31.034]  Absolutely.
[00:49:31.054 --> 00:49:32.875]  It's a huge opportunity to buy.
[00:49:33.195 --> 00:49:37.098]  Didn't come down as much as the other things, but across the board, people are selling stuff.
[00:49:37.118 --> 00:49:37.378]  Why?
[00:49:37.779 --> 00:49:38.619]  Because they need money.
[00:49:38.639 --> 00:49:39.240]  They're afraid.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.621]  They don't know what's going to happen.
[00:49:40.661 --> 00:49:41.561]  Japan is collapsing.
[00:49:41.602 --> 00:49:42.462]  Banks are collapsing.
[00:49:42.903 --> 00:49:44.123]  Tech stocks are collapsing.
[00:49:44.464 --> 00:49:48.347]  So they're selling everything thinking, oh, if I sit in cash, I'm going to be safe.
[00:49:48.847 --> 00:49:50.568]  No, because banks are failing.
[00:49:50.588 --> 00:49:52.129]  You don't want to have too much in cash.
[00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:52.670]  So
[00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:58.538]  Everybody in my view should be right now, if I had any extra money, I would be 80% in on silver.
[00:49:58.758 --> 00:50:00.080]  But I don't have any extra money.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:00.701]  So it's fine.
[00:50:00.741 --> 00:50:01.442]  I don't care about that.
[00:50:02.063 --> 00:50:03.344]  You know, I'm taking care of folks.
[00:50:03.364 --> 00:50:03.705]  I'm okay.
[00:50:03.725 --> 00:50:07.230]  But the point is, is that if I had extra money, I'd be in silver right now.
[00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:07.610]  Period.
[00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:07.791]  Boom.
[00:50:08.783 --> 00:50:09.983]  I mean, me too.
[00:50:10.044 --> 00:50:11.324]  I mean, this is what I am in.
[00:50:11.404 --> 00:50:18.827]  So everybody that heard what I just said, take advantage of this downward movement in gold and silver for the last few days.
[00:50:19.307 --> 00:50:22.428]  It didn't go down as much as stocks and bonds because it's still the safe haven.
[00:50:22.709 --> 00:50:28.411]  But we get to buy in at a discount because everything across the globe has come crashing down.
[00:50:28.831 --> 00:50:33.873]  Now, you not only have that, but you've got Israel bracing for attack.
[00:50:34.133 --> 00:50:34.393]  We're good.
[00:50:54.929 --> 00:50:56.551]  I'm not going to say anything that you're sure about, but it looks like it to me.
[00:50:56.831 --> 00:50:57.872]  Let's put it back on screen.
[00:50:57.992 --> 00:50:59.854]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:51:00.194 --> 00:51:01.736]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:51:01.756 --> 00:51:02.797]  You go to the slash gold.
[00:51:03.077 --> 00:51:03.798]  They know it came from us.
[00:51:03.818 --> 00:51:04.478]  We get support.
[00:51:04.558 --> 00:51:05.619]  So it's a win-win for everybody.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.002]  KEPM.com forward slash gold or 720-605-3900.
[00:51:10.604 --> 00:51:17.010]  I could have gold sponsors out the ass right now paying me five times more money, but they're going to charge you 30, 40, 50, 100 percent and rip you off.
[00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:18.251]  I don't need that in my life.
[00:51:18.491 --> 00:51:19.252]  I will not be part of it.
[00:51:19.532 --> 00:51:20.413]  This is the best place.
[00:51:20.633 --> 00:51:21.654]  This has the highest ratings.
[00:51:21.955 --> 00:51:22.855]  This is who's vetted.
[00:51:23.076 --> 00:51:23.996]  This is who's vaunted.
[00:51:24.397 --> 00:51:26.559]  And a little bit of money comes to us from each transaction.
[00:51:26.779 --> 00:51:31.003]  And that makes quite a bit of money at the end of the day to keep us on air as we fight the globalists.
[00:51:31.403 --> 00:51:32.363]  Such a critical thing to do.
[00:51:32.423 --> 00:51:33.424]  A total 360 win.
[00:51:33.744 --> 00:51:35.605]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:51:35.645 --> 00:51:37.485]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:51:37.585 --> 00:51:38.045]  Or 720-605-3900.
[00:51:38.065 --> 00:51:44.668]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:51:44.688 --> 00:51:44.988]  720-605-3900.
[00:51:45.028 --> 00:51:46.148]  Dr. Elliott, stay there.
[00:51:46.608 --> 00:51:50.089]  Do 15 more minutes with me and give us a little 30-second preview.
[00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:51.370]  What are you going to talk about next?
[00:51:52.799 --> 00:51:57.844]  Well, we're going to talk about what we can do in this little discounted price that we get.
[00:51:58.104 --> 00:52:01.887]  I basically emptied my bank account this morning to buy more silver.
[00:52:02.187 --> 00:52:04.990]  So we're going to talk about why this makes sense moving forward.
[00:52:06.371 --> 00:52:08.173]  All right, and a few other tidbits.
[00:52:10.106 --> 00:52:14.867]  Oh, so not only do we have Japan, what what is that causing globally?
[00:52:14.947 --> 00:52:18.508]  The bond meltdown, continued stock market meltdown.
[00:52:18.888 --> 00:52:23.128]  We've got crisis in the Middle East that always causes mayhem.
[00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:26.849]  Mayhem will cause even more people to pull back their funds.
[00:52:27.249 --> 00:52:27.429]  Right.
[00:52:27.469 --> 00:52:29.270]  So they so they don't want to spend.
[00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:30.050]  They're afraid.
[00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:32.350]  And so we can take advantage of these moves.
[00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:36.051]  Never let fear consume you into no action.
[00:52:36.764 --> 00:52:39.645]  Oh, believe me, if I had any money left, I know what I'd be doing buying silver.
[00:52:39.665 --> 00:52:40.465]  But whatever, it doesn't matter.
[00:52:40.745 --> 00:52:43.607]  You're keeping us on air and the free speech is even more valuable than silver.
[00:52:44.247 --> 00:52:44.867]  We'll be right back.
[00:52:44.907 --> 00:52:45.327]  Stay with us.
[00:52:56.111 --> 00:53:04.114]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements.
[00:53:05.131 --> 00:53:11.553]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up, and it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[00:53:12.373 --> 00:53:27.418]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking, some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[00:53:27.778 --> 00:53:29.638]  We had five companies making product for us.
[00:53:30.259 --> 00:53:34.740]  Three of them notified us that, we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're InfoWars.
[00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:41.133]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[00:53:41.153 --> 00:53:44.034]  Not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[00:53:44.855 --> 00:53:58.261]  And they said, listen, you know we were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label
[00:53:59.523 --> 00:54:03.586]  On our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[00:54:03.986 --> 00:54:07.288]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup.
[00:54:07.328 --> 00:54:14.072]  And I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling our products and a lot of the products that we developed.
[00:54:14.773 --> 00:54:22.638]  But so many of these products that they had put out, again, were the exact same thing that we were putting out.
[00:54:23.627 --> 00:54:31.729]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:38.452]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[00:54:38.612 --> 00:54:41.092]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[00:54:41.252 --> 00:54:43.173]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[00:54:43.393 --> 00:54:53.161]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[00:54:53.781 --> 00:54:56.183]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[00:54:56.243 --> 00:54:57.304]  Take Turmeric 95.
[00:54:58.985 --> 00:55:05.667]  Turmeric 95 is called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[00:55:05.807 --> 00:55:11.449]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:20.092]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[00:55:20.132 --> 00:55:22.213]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[00:55:22.233 --> 00:55:22.573]  And
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:37.127]  Because of the bankruptcy, attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[00:55:37.627 --> 00:55:42.009]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:46.712]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[00:55:47.733 --> 00:55:52.956]  So I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[00:55:53.056 --> 00:55:53.677]  It's amazing.
[00:55:53.797 --> 00:55:54.717]  It's super high quality.
[00:55:54.797 --> 00:55:56.639]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[00:56:16.952 --> 00:56:17.452]  Thank you.
[00:56:45.902 --> 00:56:51.067]  Well, gold and silver is always smart to be in over the long haul, but in today's climate, you're insane if you're not.
[00:56:51.627 --> 00:56:55.031]  The problem is, is it's riddled, because it is such a good thing, with sharks.
[00:56:55.951 --> 00:56:59.695]  Like America was the thing in the world, so all the bad guys came and tried to take it over and basically have.
[00:57:00.296 --> 00:57:03.759]  When I pitch you gold and silver, and I have it for 12 years because I couldn't find a good sponsor, it's
[00:57:04.875 --> 00:57:05.675]  Because it's a good deal.
[00:57:05.696 --> 00:57:07.116]  And it's the best place to get it.
[00:57:07.597 --> 00:57:08.998]  And I'm going to stop plugging at that point.
[00:57:09.258 --> 00:57:11.599]  This is a shorter segment, longer segment coming up under Kirk Elliott.
[00:57:12.259 --> 00:57:16.122]  But just getting into what you were talking about with gold and silver and what's happening right now.
[00:57:18.726 --> 00:57:27.755]  So I saw this this article this morning, the Chicago Fed President Goolsbee says if the economy deteriorates, the Fed will fix it.
[00:57:28.295 --> 00:57:30.357]  OK, the Fed can't fix it.
[00:57:30.457 --> 00:57:31.318]  They broke it.
[00:57:31.879 --> 00:57:32.039]  Right.
[00:57:32.079 --> 00:57:34.041]  It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
[00:57:34.101 --> 00:57:37.304]  And they think that people will believe that kind of nonsense.
[00:57:37.724 --> 00:57:40.367]  But our wallets, Alex, don't believe any of that.
[00:57:40.687 --> 00:57:42.189]  The inflation at the grocery stores.
[00:57:42.449 --> 00:57:43.190]  So here's the thing.
[00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:51.316]  When you've got inflation in grocery stores, inflation with with insurance costs, inflation with gas and fuel and housing costs and everything else.
[00:57:51.336 --> 00:57:54.278]  It's like, OK, how do you overcome inflation?
[00:57:54.679 --> 00:57:58.141]  Tangible assets like gold and silver, literally because they're things.
[00:57:58.602 --> 00:58:02.244]  See, gold and silver are a thing like everything else I just mentioned.
[00:58:02.304 --> 00:58:08.509]  Things go up with inflation because inflation is nothing more than printing money like there's no tomorrow.
[00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:09.870]  You devalue the currency.
[00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:12.933]  It takes more of that junk currency to buy things.
[00:58:13.453 --> 00:58:20.503]  Therefore, if you have things, it's going to go up in value over time because of their stupid policy.
[00:58:20.543 --> 00:58:22.786]  So here's where, take advantage of it.
[00:58:23.286 --> 00:58:25.249]  Take advantage of their dumbness, right?
[00:58:25.289 --> 00:58:30.015]  Because when they say that they can fix something if the economy deteriorates, it's like, what?
[00:58:30.436 --> 00:58:31.057]  What do you mean, if?
[00:58:31.297 --> 00:58:35.419]  The economy has deteriorated because of your own policies, right?
[00:58:35.639 --> 00:58:38.080]  But here's where their fix is starting to come in.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.421]  We've warned about this, and I'll warn about it again.
[00:58:41.441 --> 00:58:45.242]  I think their fix is digital currency, digital money, right?
[00:58:45.262 --> 00:58:55.226]  Oh, they've been saying that the head of the IMF, the World Bank, the head of the EU, they've all said that when this all comes crashing down, we played the clip over and over again of the FDIC saying there's going to be bail-ins.
[00:58:56.397 --> 00:59:01.779]  Yeah, so what is the basis though of central bank digital currency?
[00:59:01.879 --> 00:59:03.859]  It's control, right?
[00:59:04.059 --> 00:59:08.340]  It's your ideology, it's your digital social profile, your social credit score.
[00:59:08.781 --> 00:59:16.943]  So in Australia this morning they have this whole news story and they're talking about everything because of a new policy they made
[00:59:17.503 --> 00:59:18.304]  So let's be clear.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:52.098]  The Ponzi scheme is about to back itself up by enrolling the world in a new taxation, surveillance, social control grid, and so its new backing is slavery.
[00:59:53.827 --> 00:59:57.270]  It is, and so this is where gold and silver become so important.
[00:59:57.470 --> 01:00:00.073]  It's like the anti-slavery investment, right?
[01:00:00.113 --> 01:00:06.038]  Because you don't want to be part of their digital world, where everything that's digital can ultimately be tracked.
[01:00:06.058 --> 01:00:09.481]  When you take possession of something physical, it's amazing.
[01:00:09.521 --> 01:00:11.302]  You can use it for barter if you need be.
[01:00:11.663 --> 01:00:14.245]  It is the safe haven investment that central banks
[01:00:14.625 --> 01:00:15.646]  Are looking at gold.
[01:00:16.266 --> 01:00:26.010]  Individual investors like us and like manufacturers who need it for electronics, solar power, everything else, they're gobbling up silver like there's no tomorrow.
[01:00:26.291 --> 01:00:30.152]  So either one of them are doing great, but silver is outperforming gold.
[01:00:30.453 --> 01:00:32.794]  It's a way to get out of their digital system.
[01:00:33.094 --> 01:00:34.414]  You can do it with an IRA.
[01:00:34.614 --> 01:00:37.376]  You can do it outside of an IRA with a brokerage account.
[01:00:37.436 --> 01:00:39.857]  I'm going to say it again and then I'm going to sell your brokerage account.
[01:00:40.477 --> 01:00:44.498]  People, if they don't call you into a consultation right now, they are insane.
[01:00:44.718 --> 01:00:45.938]  I mean, you're the place to go.
[01:00:46.058 --> 01:00:47.138]  You support the broadcast.
[01:00:47.619 --> 01:00:51.059]  People need to at least be partially in silver or they're nuts.
[01:00:51.559 --> 01:00:56.140]  There's the number, 720-605-3900 or kpm.com forward slash gold.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.581]  Now, we're going to do a few more minutes on this side.
[01:00:59.181 --> 01:01:01.801]  You reminded me with this idiotic Federal Reserve statement.
[01:01:02.362 --> 01:01:03.962]  Guys, grab that video if you can real quick.
[01:01:04.842 --> 01:01:11.348]  You remind me of Biden just saying, I turned the economy around just a few days ago, and what an idiot he is.
[01:01:12.329 --> 01:01:14.871]  And what it would be like if Kamala got in versus Trump.
[01:01:15.392 --> 01:01:20.776]  So what's the survivable crash landing versus what looks like the Kamala nosedive?
[01:01:20.817 --> 01:01:22.158]  We'll be right back with Dr. Kirk Elliott.
[01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:22.538]  Stay with us.
[01:01:22.838 --> 01:01:24.180]  All right, into our number two.
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.302]  It is a big takeaway that Warren Buffett dumped.
[01:01:29.064 --> 01:01:31.026]  55% of his Apple stock last Friday.
[01:01:31.886 --> 01:01:36.350]  I came on the air Saturday and Sunday, and I said, look for a major stock market correction or crash Monday.
[01:01:36.851 --> 01:01:39.573]  I'm not an economist, but, you know, I play one on TV.
[01:01:39.593 --> 01:01:41.435]  The point is, I read this stuff constantly.
[01:01:41.455 --> 01:01:49.682]  That was a no-brainer, guaranteed, and now AP, Reuters, all the global headlines are, global stock market crash.
[01:01:49.742 --> 01:01:51.164]  Will it cause total collapse?
[01:01:52.383 --> 01:01:58.450]  They wouldn't be running those headlines unless they wanted to push this further and create more contagion and more fear.
[01:01:59.131 --> 01:02:01.794]  Not that we aren't at the end of a giant bubble, and it's super dangerous.
[01:02:01.814 --> 01:02:08.242]  We've been saying we don't know right when the bubble's going to pop, but at a certain point it gets so big it does pop like blowing a balloon up.
[01:02:08.262 --> 01:02:10.084]  It gets bigger and bigger, and suddenly, bam!
[01:02:12.475 --> 01:02:14.636]  When they don't want it to pop, they'd be saying everything's fine.
[01:02:14.736 --> 01:02:28.100]  Instead, they're like, oh my god, it's run for the hills, we're all dead, while they shut down all the small trading companies and all the medium-sized trading companies and all the big massive pop consumer sites like Robinhood and all the rest.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.380]  They're just shut down.
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:30.541]  They're having major problems.
[01:02:30.561 --> 01:02:31.601]  They're having all these outages.
[01:02:32.001 --> 01:02:33.962]  Just magically, but all the big boys
[01:02:35.014 --> 01:02:44.677]  They're still chugging along and operating, and then you've got the Federal Reserve, the same ones that told us there was an inflation problem four years ago, then there was one, then they fixed it, now they haven't.
[01:02:45.037 --> 01:02:49.098]  Chicago Fed President Goolsbee says the economy deteriorates.
[01:02:49.218 --> 01:02:51.719]  Fed will fix it.
[01:02:51.819 --> 01:02:56.780]  Well, they keep pissing on us and telling us it's raining, so I thought I'd play a few clips.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.802]  Here's Biden just last week, and Kamala talking about how wonderful Bidenomics is.
[01:03:19.308 --> 01:03:21.149]  That is called Bytonomics.
[01:03:25.812 --> 01:03:29.334]  That is called Bytonomics and we are very proud of Bytonomics.
[01:03:30.393 --> 01:03:31.474]  What a clown show.
[01:03:31.614 --> 01:03:37.860]  I mean, this is just Biden up there saying, I cured the economy, I cured the environment, and a lot of other things.
[01:03:38.501 --> 01:03:40.943]  And then she's up there cackling and can barely talk.
[01:03:41.764 --> 01:03:45.808]  I mean, this does not instill confidence in anybody.
[01:03:46.228 --> 01:03:49.392]  And then meanwhile, he also said last week, he ended all wars.
[01:03:50.452 --> 01:03:52.673]  There's massive wars, proxy wars with Russia.
[01:03:53.474 --> 01:03:56.816]  I mean, man, I mean, the BS level with these people.
[01:03:56.836 --> 01:03:58.557]  I mean, we know they're puppets, but still.
[01:03:59.017 --> 01:04:04.221]  The globalists said decades ago, we want to put puppets in the discredited nation states, and then bureaucracy controls things.
[01:04:04.241 --> 01:04:08.884]  But if the bureaucracy controls puppets who aren't believable, that also hurts the bureaucracy.
[01:04:09.284 --> 01:04:12.186]  This is kind of like a snake eating its tail, Dr. Kirk Elliott.
[01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:14.838]  Well, it is.
[01:04:15.098 --> 01:04:19.981]  So that video of Kamala was so incredibly stupid, and I'll tell you why.
[01:04:20.401 --> 01:04:23.863]  If you could put it back on the screen, did you notice the backdrop?
[01:04:24.263 --> 01:04:25.224]  All of that red.
[01:04:25.464 --> 01:04:26.424]  Yeah, put it up.
[01:04:28.005 --> 01:04:31.687]  So that backdrop, she's talking about how Bidenomics is good.
[01:04:32.427 --> 01:04:39.513]  That is a, so if there's a little square on there that's green, that's a stock that's gone up.
[01:04:39.734 --> 01:04:42.296]  If it's red, that's a stock that comes down.
[01:04:42.416 --> 01:04:45.699]  And if the box is bigger, it's got a larger percentage decline.
[01:04:45.739 --> 01:04:49.282]  Now look at Apple, minus six point something percent, Google down minus four.
[01:04:49.602 --> 01:04:57.129]  She's talking about how the economy is doing good when every single stock that's behind her is collapsing.
[01:04:57.409 --> 01:05:04.083]  So that's like that Naked Gun episode where the buildings are blowing up and on fire and he goes, everything's fine here, everything's great.
[01:05:04.423 --> 01:05:04.604]  Yeah.
[01:05:06.053 --> 01:05:08.896]  Leslie Nielsen, there's nothing to see here, right?
[01:05:09.316 --> 01:05:14.382]  And I don't understand, she didn't obviously understand what was behind her when she was making that statement.
[01:05:14.422 --> 01:05:16.043]  Like, she doesn't understand a lot of things.
[01:05:16.564 --> 01:05:19.347]  Bidenomics is killing America, right?
[01:05:19.367 --> 01:05:23.732]  Now they're caught between a rock and a hard place, just like Japan was.
[01:05:23.852 --> 01:05:27.035]  This is the problem that's going to come next.
[01:05:27.856 --> 01:05:37.260]  Japan, if they didn't raise interest rates, their inflation would have eaten them alive, and they would have gone into a hyperinflation.
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:42.762]  So therefore, they chose, let's raise rates, see what it does to the economy, right?
[01:05:44.102 --> 01:05:46.765]  Because if they didn't, the inflation would have persisted.
[01:05:46.805 --> 01:05:51.650]  But now they've created a global recession from that one move.
[01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:53.833]  So America's big too.
[01:05:53.893 --> 01:05:56.115]  America's got a bigger economy than Japan.
[01:05:56.476 --> 01:05:57.957]  We're in the same pickle.
[01:05:58.598 --> 01:06:03.703]  If you raise interest rates, you accelerate this inflationary depression.
[01:06:04.564 --> 01:06:07.807]  And if you do nothing, the inflation goes through the roof, right?
[01:06:07.867 --> 01:06:13.171]  So this is a serious problem that we have, and there is not a good outcome.
[01:06:13.231 --> 01:06:17.194]  So to me, Alex, the outcome is quite clear.
[01:06:17.594 --> 01:06:19.796]  The red background again, there's one green square.
[01:06:20.517 --> 01:06:21.617]  The outcome
[01:06:22.458 --> 01:06:23.699]  It's simple for them.
[01:06:24.239 --> 01:06:26.700]  Let's usher in central bank digital currency.
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:27.481]  This is the fix.
[01:06:27.941 --> 01:06:28.661]  The fix is in.
[01:06:29.102 --> 01:06:34.945]  And you can trust us, just like what Goolsbee said, if the economy is broke, the Fed can fix it, right?
[01:06:34.985 --> 01:06:42.409]  No, the Fed has broken the economy with their policies of excessive debt and cheap credit.
[01:06:42.949 --> 01:06:44.089]  But I mean, I want to be clear.
[01:06:44.129 --> 01:06:50.333]  The other big piece of this is Buffett and the insiders choose to, okay, well, Mark, this is the top.
[01:06:51.058 --> 01:06:52.339]  Then they dump it.
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:53.601]  They know the market's going down.
[01:06:53.641 --> 01:06:59.666]  They freeze all the other general low-level consumers out of the market while they do all their insider deals.
[01:07:00.107 --> 01:07:01.648]  Then they bring in the Plunge Protection Team.
[01:07:01.668 --> 01:07:03.190]  People that don't know, you might want to explain that to folks.
[01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:07.794]  The President's Working Group on Markets, whatever it's called, that was set up after the 87 crash.
[01:07:08.395 --> 01:07:11.258]  And then they pump it back up, at least partially,
[01:07:12.324 --> 01:07:19.994]  And so they're just consolidating, riding the waves up and down, basically surfing this, but getting us ready for the end of the bubble.
[01:07:20.355 --> 01:07:21.196]  Is that an accurate statement?
[01:07:22.113 --> 01:07:26.354]  Yeah, so the stock market is a function of revenues, Alex.
[01:07:26.394 --> 01:07:28.715]  So how do you get revenues to go into companies?
[01:07:29.015 --> 01:07:31.335]  Either people spending money or stimulus money.
[01:07:31.536 --> 01:07:33.096]  Either one of them are revenues to companies.
[01:07:33.116 --> 01:07:34.296]  They don't care, right?
[01:07:34.356 --> 01:07:36.917]  So we are not spending money as a people.
[01:07:36.957 --> 01:07:37.757]  We're tapped out.
[01:07:37.797 --> 01:07:39.018]  We're living at the margin.
[01:07:39.098 --> 01:07:41.058]  We've got more debts than we have income.
[01:07:41.378 --> 01:07:43.959]  So therefore, everything's being held up by
[01:07:44.779 --> 01:07:47.600]  The Plunge Protection Team, whatever you want to call it, right?
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.340]  It's simply the stimulus money.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:56.602]  Same thing that was keeping banks propped up after Silicon Valley Bank went under, which was what?
[01:07:56.702 --> 01:08:03.684]  It was called the Bank Temp Funding Program to go exclusively towards banks, right?
[01:08:03.704 --> 01:08:08.545]  Because they didn't want them to go into FDIC receivership because the FDIC only has 1.17% of all assets covered now.
[01:08:11.886 --> 01:08:14.389]  Yeah, go back and repeat that.
[01:08:14.409 --> 01:08:15.490]  I know most listeners have heard it.
[01:08:16.411 --> 01:08:17.492]  We have a lot of new listeners.
[01:08:17.752 --> 01:08:19.834]  We have tens of millions of new viewers right now.
[01:08:19.854 --> 01:08:20.815]  I mean, just the last few days.
[01:08:20.855 --> 01:08:22.377]  So millions of new people are tuned in.
[01:08:22.877 --> 01:08:24.298]  Guys, get the FDIC clip.
[01:08:24.579 --> 01:08:26.180]  And listeners, I know you've seen this 20 times.
[01:08:26.521 --> 01:08:28.423]  This is a public service announcement for people who don't know.
[01:08:28.623 --> 01:08:29.684]  I know you already knew this.
[01:08:30.084 --> 01:08:31.666]  Some of you knew it before I knew it last year.
[01:08:31.986 --> 01:08:33.368]  But here's the FDIC meeting.
[01:08:34.088 --> 01:08:35.389]  And the thing's two hours long.
[01:08:35.409 --> 01:08:36.290]  You got to go watch it, folks.
[01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:40.833]  It's on X. And they're literally like, well, we're going to have to grab their bank accounts and bail in soon.
[01:08:40.873 --> 01:08:44.476]  We don't want to tell them that yet and panic them, but it may be coming next month or next year.
[01:08:44.516 --> 01:08:45.396]  It's coming for sure.
[01:08:45.957 --> 01:08:48.259]  And then Dr. Elliott and I both studied
[01:08:49.059 --> 01:09:00.427]  What the UN has done, what Bill Gates has set up, what the WFS, they've all got standardized global apps ready to then say, don't worry, your bank account has half the money taken out of it.
[01:09:00.447 --> 01:09:02.808]  Don't worry, you just lost half your stock portfolio.
[01:09:02.828 --> 01:09:08.232]  But if you opt into this new global emergency program we've been testing, the AI says you'll get 90% back.
[01:09:09.773 --> 01:09:13.976]  But everything will be on a new general ledger in lifetime, and you won't own it.
[01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:15.117]  It'll be pooled.
[01:09:15.197 --> 01:09:16.738]  You'll own nothing, but you'll love it.
[01:09:16.978 --> 01:09:18.539]  And this is what they admit they're going to do.
[01:09:18.819 --> 01:09:22.101]  So that's how they want to bring us into a crisis, to sell us that.
[01:09:22.541 --> 01:09:29.946]  But they know because it's been discredited and governments haven't fully gotten on board yet, and Trump has said he's going to kill it, then they don't want to drop the hammer.
[01:09:29.986 --> 01:09:30.447]  And folks,
[01:09:31.247 --> 01:09:33.690]  It's like Endgame where he's got the jewels of death.
[01:09:34.351 --> 01:09:37.254]  You get in this, you think these people are running your life now.
[01:09:37.654 --> 01:09:37.994]  Woo!
[01:09:38.135 --> 01:09:40.057]  Because, oh yeah, 90% will go back.
[01:09:40.097 --> 01:09:41.578]  They've said in their war games.
[01:09:42.435 --> 01:09:42.475]  So,
[01:10:12.642 --> 01:10:13.883]  What is the Mark of the Beast?
[01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:18.385]  It's basically your money being separated from you, right?
[01:10:18.465 --> 01:10:22.027]  You can't buy or sell unless you have the mark.
[01:10:22.167 --> 01:10:23.908]  That's what Revelation 13 tells us.
[01:10:24.428 --> 01:10:29.751]  So when you look at all of these digital social profiles and social prediscords, just like what we just saw,
[01:10:30.091 --> 01:10:34.712]  In Australia, early today, hmm, this is a problem, right?
[01:10:35.233 --> 01:10:38.393]  This is money that you are going to be separated from.
[01:10:38.894 --> 01:10:47.816]  Now, they can do it numerous ways, and they're going to make it, Alex, so you think that it's such a good idea to accept this mark, right?
[01:10:47.876 --> 01:10:53.758]  For example— And those of us that are against everybody signing on and giving over our rights, we're the reason things aren't fixed!
[01:10:55.674 --> 01:10:55.894]  Yeah.
[01:10:56.114 --> 01:11:10.024]  So let's just say you're you're a retiree or you've got some kind of a government pension and they go to the FedNow app or they go to some kind of central bank to the currency or say, hey, Alex, you're getting this government money.
[01:11:10.304 --> 01:11:15.687]  You're going to cut it off from your Social Security, your Medicare, your Medicaid, your pension.
[01:11:16.288 --> 01:11:21.111]  Unless you go with this FedNow app, unless you go with our system, you're going to not receive it anymore.
[01:11:21.651 --> 01:11:22.712]  And what are you going to say?
[01:11:23.152 --> 01:11:24.153]  You're a follower of Jesus.
[01:11:24.173 --> 01:11:24.853]  You've read the Bible.
[01:11:24.873 --> 01:11:25.454]  It's like, man,
[01:11:26.014 --> 01:11:28.838]  This sounds like the Mark of the Beast, but I need my money.
[01:11:29.119 --> 01:11:31.161]  How am I going to live without it, right?
[01:11:31.542 --> 01:11:41.355]  This is where... And by the way, notice all the Christian symbols banned during the Olympics, but they could desecrate the Last Supper and have open Satanism.
[01:11:41.375 --> 01:11:42.257]  This is out in the open.
[01:11:43.931 --> 01:11:44.953]  Oh, it's disgusting.
[01:11:45.513 --> 01:11:47.036]  It's just totally out in the open.
[01:11:47.596 --> 01:11:53.165]  And what they're doing is they're doing it and doing a fake apology later, right, knowing it's, I'm sorry.
[01:11:53.205 --> 01:11:54.186]  After the damage is done.
[01:11:54.206 --> 01:11:55.168]  They knew what they were doing.
[01:11:55.188 --> 01:11:57.231]  It's like I burn your house down and say, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:11:59.209 --> 01:12:01.430]  Yeah, so this is what they're doing.
[01:12:01.730 --> 01:12:06.111]  And then you've got men beating up girls in the boxing ring.
[01:12:06.571 --> 01:12:08.772]  And nobody, where are the feminists?
[01:12:09.212 --> 01:12:10.992]  You know, screaming, what about that girl?
[01:12:11.172 --> 01:12:12.313]  Some guy just beat her up.
[01:12:12.473 --> 01:12:13.933]  I thought it was bad with one.
[01:12:14.233 --> 01:12:17.254]  There were four guys got gold medals beating women up.
[01:12:19.403 --> 01:12:20.924]  I mean, I can't believe it.
[01:12:21.524 --> 01:12:22.024]  I can't.
[01:12:22.224 --> 01:12:24.986]  I mean, this is just the moral decadence, the decay.
[01:12:25.406 --> 01:12:36.971]  And so when you've got that kind of morality and ethics kind of permeating through our society, of course, people are going to say, yeah, the mark of the beast thing sounds OK, because they don't have that moral ethic.
[01:12:36.991 --> 01:12:38.211]  Because they put you into the crisis.
[01:12:38.231 --> 01:12:39.252]  They don't have the background.
[01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:42.193]  But you're really putting your leg in a bear trap.
[01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:45.475]  So people have the money and I know most of us don't in this economy.
[01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:49.196]  I don't need to be an economist, though I know you're super smart and learned from you.
[01:12:49.736 --> 01:12:50.576]  I'm in the real world.
[01:12:50.656 --> 01:12:56.138]  So, our audience was over 30 million real people tuned in a day in 2016-17.
[01:12:56.178 --> 01:12:59.479]  They censored us, crushed us down to about 5 million, but they were hardcore supporters.
[01:12:59.519 --> 01:13:00.139]  We stayed on air.
[01:13:00.939 --> 01:13:03.500]  And then now we're back to 30-40 million a day, as big as we ever were.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:07.461]  Okay, in the old days, with that big an audience, we had tons of money coming in.
[01:13:07.481 --> 01:13:08.541]  We could expand everything.
[01:13:09.081 --> 01:13:11.342]  We have as big an audience ever and almost no money coming in.
[01:13:11.462 --> 01:13:12.422]  And I talk to other businesses.
[01:13:12.462 --> 01:13:13.683]  I go to restaurants I used to go to.
[01:13:13.903 --> 01:13:15.564]  You have to wait a month to get into.
[01:13:15.804 --> 01:13:16.964]  You go in there, they're half empty.
[01:13:17.004 --> 01:13:18.525]  And that's in a big boom town like Austin.
[01:13:18.825 --> 01:13:20.006]  I talk to everybody else I know.
[01:13:20.046 --> 01:13:21.827]  I've got family with multiple degrees, everything.
[01:13:21.987 --> 01:13:22.967]  They're all working two jobs.
[01:13:23.407 --> 01:13:25.868]  Everybody knows in the real world, things are not going well.
[01:13:26.349 --> 01:13:28.670]  And so that's the disconnect.
[01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:30.650]  The media tells us everything's fine.
[01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:31.151]  It's not.
[01:13:31.531 --> 01:13:33.912]  They know the lie didn't work, so now they're going with the collapse.
[01:13:36.308 --> 01:13:39.249]  Well, and people are starting to feel that, Alex, people.
[01:13:39.289 --> 01:13:44.470]  So, just case in point, during this show, I just got a message from my team.
[01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:46.911]  It's like, the phones are ringing literally off the hook.
[01:13:47.311 --> 01:13:50.732]  It's like, so because people are hearing, they're finally seeing it.
[01:13:50.792 --> 01:13:51.592]  You know what it took?
[01:13:52.052 --> 01:13:57.954]  A spark of the stock market starting to collapse for people to say, well, maybe Alex and Kirk are right.
[01:13:58.254 --> 01:14:00.095]  Literally, the phones are ringing off the hook.
[01:14:00.115 --> 01:14:02.995]  So calm, so we can get you at the front of the line, right?
[01:14:03.195 --> 01:14:04.356]  I want to tell us there's something.
[01:14:04.376 --> 01:14:05.076]  I want to tell us there's something.
[01:14:05.959 --> 01:14:31.910]  I saw a bunch of comments on X, and they were real accounts, they weren't trolls, so I responded to them, and when I was saying, we don't want riots in England, this is a setup, I know you've been screwed over, but you're being set up, they're gonna use it for a police state, I was there January 6th, they were like, your bottom line doesn't matter, we're gonna have a revolution, I'm like, burning down random police stations, pulling random brown people out of cars, beating them up, that's not how revolutions fought, that's not how it's won, I have paid everything in the bottom line
[01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.791]  For the truth.
[01:14:32.891 --> 01:14:37.497]  I've sold almost everything I have to stay on air because I knew we're at this key juncture in history.
[01:14:38.038 --> 01:14:40.481]  I only promote what I think is the smartest.
[01:14:40.802 --> 01:14:46.670]  I didn't get on the air three weeks ago and said cyber attacks and power outages and war and...
[01:14:47.842 --> 01:14:51.565]  And stock market crashes because I just wanted to sound scary.
[01:14:51.705 --> 01:14:54.867]  I really believe that because this is all I do, folks.
[01:14:54.927 --> 01:14:55.828]  I dream about this all night.
[01:14:56.108 --> 01:14:57.509]  I work 15 hours a day.
[01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:59.731]  And I'm wrong a small percentage of the time.
[01:14:59.791 --> 01:15:01.152]  And I want to be wrong, okay?
[01:15:01.452 --> 01:15:02.333]  I told you about it.
[01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:04.355]  This is the big one, folks.
[01:15:04.395 --> 01:15:05.636]  The bubbles come to the end.
[01:15:05.996 --> 01:15:06.536]  We're here.
[01:15:06.556 --> 01:15:08.298]  I don't sit there and tell you.
[01:15:08.318 --> 01:15:09.859]  Again, I'm going to say it again.
[01:15:10.925 --> 01:15:22.627]  I have the biggest gold companies in the nation, and it's the one evil thing conservatives are doing, and I don't think they know, but the other big talk show house have these companies that charge people 30, 40, 50, 100% premiums on gold and silver.
[01:15:23.367 --> 01:15:26.348]  That's why I won't do it, because I won't screw people.
[01:15:26.748 --> 01:15:27.448]  God's watching.
[01:15:27.528 --> 01:15:31.189]  I don't want to hurt some old lady, but I feel totally good about you with an 8%.
[01:15:32.269 --> 01:15:36.369]  Pays your crew, pays your staff, pays your sponsors, and we all make enough money to live.
[01:15:36.829 --> 01:15:39.310]  I could make five times the money right now
[01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:46.954]  Putting on the other gold companies who aren't even the worst, and rationalizing, oh, we're going to charge people 50% more, 30% more.
[01:15:47.314 --> 01:15:47.895]  I won't do that.
[01:15:48.295 --> 01:15:49.876]  This is the place to get gold and silver.
[01:15:50.196 --> 01:15:52.718]  I told you, and it's one of the smartest moves you can do.
[01:15:52.958 --> 01:15:54.559]  But everything I do is based in...
[01:15:55.399 --> 01:15:58.282]  What's the best water filter of the highest ratings and lowest price?
[01:15:58.822 --> 01:16:07.951]  Okay, well, there's over 100 gravity-fed filters, and the top three are these, and these companies go with the premium, but this is the exact same filter for, you know, almost half the price.
[01:16:08.391 --> 01:16:11.334]  I'd go with that filter, even though we only make $40 on it.
[01:16:12.575 --> 01:16:16.718]  If I sold the same filter under a fancier name, we'd make $150.
[01:16:17.099 --> 01:16:25.125]  But I have this weird thing where I'm like, no, if I was out there, a family, wanting this, I would sell this thing that was the best deal.
[01:16:25.465 --> 01:16:30.549]  That's why they attacked me and lied and told all these stories about hundreds of millions of dollars and ripping you off.
[01:16:30.649 --> 01:16:31.370]  All that's fake.
[01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:32.290]  None of it's true.
[01:16:32.490 --> 01:16:32.791]  J.D.
[01:16:32.851 --> 01:16:34.291]  Vance doesn't wear mascara.
[01:16:34.491 --> 01:16:34.752]  J.D.
[01:16:34.832 --> 01:16:36.212]  Vance doesn't have sex with couches.
[01:16:36.512 --> 01:16:37.733]  I don't pee on kids' graves.
[01:16:38.053 --> 01:16:40.274]  You know, Tommy Robinson didn't call for revolution.
[01:16:40.294 --> 01:16:42.115]  He said, don't be violent, over and over again.
[01:16:42.695 --> 01:16:50.359]  And the good news is, because of X, and because of Infowars and other platformers, people knew what we said versus what they claimed.
[01:16:50.379 --> 01:16:54.121]  But all I'm saying is, folks, the number one thing you better do
[01:16:55.191 --> 01:16:57.812]  Is get right with God and get politically active.
[01:16:58.332 --> 01:17:03.894]  And if you got a family that's got a farm or whatever, tell them, hey, if everything collapses, can we come live there and help you or whatever?
[01:17:04.154 --> 01:17:05.955]  Because they don't have to know how to do everything.
[01:17:06.375 --> 01:17:12.457]  Maybe this farm produces cows and chickens and another farm produces grain and fruits and vegetables.
[01:17:13.297 --> 01:17:15.338]  And then there's a doctor that lives next door.
[01:17:15.698 --> 01:17:17.839]  And then down the street, there's a guy that knows how to shoe horses.
[01:17:18.239 --> 01:17:19.219]  That's what community is about.
[01:17:19.279 --> 01:17:21.260]  And if I was just a selfish person,
[01:17:23.081 --> 01:17:25.966]  I would be hiding out in the countryside right now.
[01:17:26.346 --> 01:17:27.248]  This is that dangerous.
[01:17:27.448 --> 01:17:34.459]  Every day I look at my children and my family and I feel guilty at a selfish level that I've not turned tail and run.
[01:17:34.499 --> 01:17:37.624]  But as a man and to pull back in the spirit, I understand
[01:17:38.607 --> 01:17:42.109]  If we don't fight these people, it's gonna get so bad, that's all gonna get overrun.
[01:17:42.189 --> 01:17:49.692]  The only chance we've got is to fight this full-on with courage, and God recognizes courage, and God intervenes, like with President Trump, with his courage.
[01:17:49.973 --> 01:17:54.435]  So, you better get God, you better get family, and you better get your priorities straight, folks.
[01:17:54.695 --> 01:17:58.457]  The golf, and the movies, and all that crap, I love it as much as anybody.
[01:17:58.777 --> 01:17:59.577]  It's over.
[01:18:00.298 --> 01:18:01.058]  It's over.
[01:18:01.918 --> 01:18:02.479]  It's over.
[01:18:02.879 --> 01:18:03.199]  Okay?
[01:18:03.639 --> 01:18:04.540]  That's what I'm telling you.
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:06.441]  And I know I'm ranting, go ahead and finish up.
[01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:06.901]  Sorry.
[01:18:08.527 --> 01:18:09.328]  It was a good rant.
[01:18:09.368 --> 01:18:13.751]  I mean, I was going to say basically the same things, Alec, because it's spot-on accurate.
[01:18:14.172 --> 01:18:15.653]  We're at the end of an age.
[01:18:15.713 --> 01:18:20.857]  We're at the end of an age of fiat-based money, central banks.
[01:18:21.057 --> 01:18:23.138]  Now, they've been exposed, right?
[01:18:23.319 --> 01:18:29.804]  Truth always casts out the darkness, and it's basically the whole global monetary system is based on debt.
[01:18:30.244 --> 01:18:33.587]  Well, we see what happens with debt, what just happened in Japan.
[01:18:34.167 --> 01:18:36.349]  They have so much debt when they raise interest rates.
[01:18:36.409 --> 01:18:38.391]  Now nobody can afford to make their payments.
[01:18:38.571 --> 01:18:39.472]  Banks are failing.
[01:18:39.793 --> 01:18:41.274]  That will spread over here.
[01:18:41.794 --> 01:18:42.695]  So have faith.
[01:18:42.976 --> 01:18:43.736]  Have courage.
[01:18:44.417 --> 01:18:45.058]  Call us.
[01:18:45.458 --> 01:18:52.665]  And literally we the only way that you can know the solution how good it is is if you understand how bad the world is becoming.
[01:18:52.705 --> 01:18:54.727]  We don't have to sensationalize anything Alex.
[01:18:54.787 --> 01:18:55.248]  It's bad.
[01:18:55.808 --> 01:19:00.830]  I mean, it's really bad, and they're trying to get their way, but God gives us wisdom.
[01:19:01.190 --> 01:19:02.551]  He gives us understanding.
[01:19:02.731 --> 01:19:10.654]  He gives us courage and boldness and creativity, always, 100% of the time, to start navigating through this.
[01:19:10.714 --> 01:19:15.016]  What's the one thing that you have to do, right, when God can do anything?
[01:19:15.376 --> 01:19:16.297]  You have to act.
[01:19:16.957 --> 01:19:19.398]  It's hard for him, even God, to steer a cart, right?
[01:19:19.438 --> 01:19:26.120]  You have to be moving, you have to act, take that leap of faith, and start to get out of harm's way.
[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:31.561]  There's an old Bedouin saying, trust in God, but tie up your camel.
[01:19:32.022 --> 01:19:36.523]  And there's an old Christian saying from the Middle Ages, God helps those that help themselves.
[01:19:39.363 --> 01:19:40.483]  Well, yeah.
[01:19:40.523 --> 01:19:41.804]  Faith without works is dead.
[01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:42.824]  Right?
[01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:43.984]  That's another way to say it.
[01:19:44.044 --> 01:19:45.785]  You have to actually act.
[01:19:46.205 --> 01:19:49.266]  You can have all the faith in the world that something good is going to happen.
[01:19:49.306 --> 01:19:53.507]  If you just sit there like a couch potato and do nothing, it's not going to work.
[01:19:54.068 --> 01:20:03.951]  Faith coupled with action will get you to a place of amazing peace and security and safety and prosperity.
[01:20:04.071 --> 01:20:04.411]  All of it.
[01:20:04.551 --> 01:20:07.732]  All those blessings of heaven you can have, but you have to act.
[01:20:08.852 --> 01:20:11.374]  I asked you a question earlier and I know I was interrupted so you didn't get to it.
[01:20:11.774 --> 01:20:15.175]  In closing, Dr. Kerr-Kelley at kpm.com forward slash cold.
[01:20:16.936 --> 01:20:19.517]  Trump knows how to create confidence.
[01:20:19.537 --> 01:20:20.498]  He knows how to get jobs back.
[01:20:20.538 --> 01:20:21.898]  He knows how to cut energy prices.
[01:20:22.379 --> 01:20:25.840]  That is the one way to mitigate, mitigate, not fix, inflation.
[01:20:26.961 --> 01:20:28.441]  What do you see if Trump got in?
[01:20:29.362 --> 01:20:33.804]  Is it a survivable crash landing versus if Kamala gets in?
[01:20:37.393 --> 01:20:44.463]  I think we still have a lot of dark times to get through because Biden has gotten us so low, it's going to take a while to even get back to zero.
[01:20:44.864 --> 01:20:48.389]  So don't think that Trump is going to fix things overnight and it's going to be fine.
[01:20:48.409 --> 01:20:51.153]  I was about to say, people can't expect Trump to do miracles.
[01:20:53.203 --> 01:20:53.503]  You're right.
[01:20:54.004 --> 01:20:54.985]  No, he will fix it.
[01:20:55.025 --> 01:20:58.590]  He's the best economic president we've ever had in this country.
[01:20:59.111 --> 01:21:09.545]  And some of the ideas that he has, tariffs on foreign goods, right, eliminating income tax, creating prosperity, right, by giving tax incentives to companies who hire people.
[01:21:09.585 --> 01:21:10.827]  That's not an evil thing.
[01:21:11.307 --> 01:21:14.148]  Right, and that means that companies that are out there, they're going to be able to hire.
[01:21:14.469 --> 01:21:15.909]  Look what Bidenomics did.
[01:21:15.989 --> 01:21:20.231]  That recent report that you had on the screen just a little bit ago, new job numbers, 114,000.
[01:21:20.271 --> 01:21:24.493]  This is way worse than expected, like way worse.
[01:21:25.034 --> 01:21:29.536]  Not even Biden's lies can cover up the horrible job growth, right?
[01:21:29.576 --> 01:21:29.856]  It's like,
[01:21:30.643 --> 01:21:40.247]  That Biden is horrible for America, Trump is going to do a great thing, but do not, please do not, you know, put these massive expectations on somebody that they're going to fix something overnight.
[01:21:40.747 --> 01:21:52.732]  It's going to take some time to unbury us, to resurrect what the enemy has tried to kill in America, with our economy, and in our lives, but it will be done, and it can be done.
[01:21:52.992 --> 01:22:00.380]  Well, that's the biggest thing he's got in his quiver of arrows, is the globalists have said America and Europe's not open for business, so everybody invests in Asia.
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.162]  He immediately says, we're open.
[01:22:02.622 --> 01:22:04.765]  That's why we saw such a supercharging economy.
[01:22:05.125 --> 01:22:05.946]  Then they hit us with COVID.
[01:22:05.966 --> 01:22:08.729]  And you said it 30 minutes ago, they're going to hit him with a new pandemic.
[01:22:08.749 --> 01:22:09.730]  They've already pre-programmed it.
[01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:10.230]  We can see it.
[01:22:10.631 --> 01:22:14.495]  We've got to get ahead of that and not get into the fear again and get serious and get ready as well.
[01:22:14.875 --> 01:22:15.476]  We're good to go.
[01:22:34.127 --> 01:22:34.747]  We'll see him.
[01:22:34.767 --> 01:22:35.388]  Bye-bye.
[01:23:05.453 --> 01:23:07.274]  I mean, I don't even know what to tell people.
[01:23:08.034 --> 01:23:12.036]  I told you all months ago, even before they tried to kill Trump, I said, they're going to try to kill him.
[01:23:12.537 --> 01:23:13.977]  They're going to crash the stock market.
[01:23:14.297 --> 01:23:15.458]  They're going to start big wars.
[01:23:15.798 --> 01:23:16.619]  I know these people.
[01:23:16.819 --> 01:23:19.440]  I mean, that's all I do is study these jerks.
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:21.761]  And we are here.
[01:23:22.301 --> 01:23:24.242]  So I don't know what to say to you.
[01:23:24.282 --> 01:23:25.263]  We're all in this together.
[01:23:26.023 --> 01:23:27.104]  And this is horrible.
[01:23:27.984 --> 01:23:29.946]  But at least we know what's going on.
[01:23:30.647 --> 01:23:36.013]  Can you imagine being the average person that still thinks the government's good?
[01:23:36.033 --> 01:23:39.117]  That still thinks good people are in charge?
[01:23:41.027 --> 01:23:42.969]  They're gonna be dangerous during this.
[01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:46.853]  So I'd get extra ammo and I'd go out to the shooting range and learn how to use your guns.
[01:23:47.513 --> 01:23:50.356]  Because crime is gonna go off the frickin' hook.
[01:23:50.736 --> 01:23:52.738]  They've already cut back massive numbers of police.
[01:23:53.179 --> 01:23:55.861]  They have, all over the world, they have teed us up for disaster.
[01:23:56.282 --> 01:23:57.523]  We'll talk about how we go through this.
[01:23:57.543 --> 01:23:58.604]  A lot of breaking news straight ahead.
[01:23:58.624 --> 01:23:59.085]  Please stay with us.
[01:23:59.845 --> 01:24:00.706]  Nitric Boost.
[01:24:01.647 --> 01:24:02.127]  Turmeric 95.
[01:24:04.375 --> 01:24:07.298]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[01:24:08.239 --> 01:24:13.223]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[01:24:13.724 --> 01:24:20.890]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[01:24:21.451 --> 01:24:23.433]  They let us private label their products.
[01:24:23.453 --> 01:24:24.333]  That's why you've already heard of
[01:24:25.174 --> 01:24:26.234]  Body's Old Turmeric Formula?
[01:24:26.535 --> 01:24:29.296]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[01:24:29.556 --> 01:24:30.856]  This is just their brand of that.
[01:24:31.196 --> 01:24:34.137]  And so, it is available under Turmeric 95.
[01:24:34.898 --> 01:24:35.498]  That's the name.
[01:24:35.758 --> 01:24:42.241]  So, we're sold out of Body's, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated turmeric.
[01:24:42.481 --> 01:24:43.541]  Same thing with Nitric Boost.
[01:24:43.961 --> 01:24:45.582]  Nitric Boost came from this company.
[01:24:45.622 --> 01:24:47.643]  They even let us use their name.
[01:24:47.923 --> 01:24:48.923]  It's now our best seller.
[01:24:49.123 --> 01:24:50.124]  We sold out of our version.
[01:24:50.404 --> 01:24:51.844]  Their version has a white model.
[01:24:52.164 --> 01:24:53.545]  It's the exact same thing.
[01:24:54.085 --> 01:24:55.685]  You get it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:24:55.925 --> 01:24:58.206]  So check out InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:24:58.326 --> 01:24:59.686]  All right.
[01:24:59.706 --> 01:25:01.867]  I want listeners to listen to me very, very carefully.
[01:25:02.527 --> 01:25:11.148]  And when I lecture you, please know it comes from a place of great respect because I'm lecturing myself and Trump because I'm just like Trump.
[01:25:11.208 --> 01:25:11.889]  I'm just like you.
[01:25:11.909 --> 01:25:12.869]  We're the same.
[01:25:13.229 --> 01:25:16.950]  We can be old, young, black, white, brown, people that get stuff done.
[01:25:17.670 --> 01:25:18.370]  We're not victims.
[01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:19.310]  Bad stuff happens to us.
[01:25:19.330 --> 01:25:19.990]  We just move on.
[01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:23.651]  And it even becomes something we celebrate.
[01:25:25.407 --> 01:25:38.973]  So Trump is going to get caught up trying to save the economy and trying to win the election, he's not going to watch his ass, he's literally going to departmentalize them trying to kill him, and then he's not going to stay focused on the fact they did that as a major issue, and he won't stay focused on his safety, he'll get killed.
[01:25:39.693 --> 01:25:42.515]  I mean, I'd say 50% chance he's dead before the election.
[01:25:43.075 --> 01:25:46.956]  And I don't say that with pleasure, and I hope that prediction doesn't come true.
[01:25:47.757 --> 01:25:52.199]  And in fact, I thought a higher number in my mind, but because I don't want to demoralize people,
[01:25:54.403 --> 01:25:55.824]  I think 80% chance he's dead.
[01:25:55.844 --> 01:25:57.464]  I'm just going to say everything.
[01:25:59.425 --> 01:26:11.231]  If he doesn't change the trajectory, if he doesn't come out and say the Secret Service stood down, he was crawling on the roof in front of everybody, and they lied to Congress, and the guy that ran the stand down said he didn't know who did the stand down and got caught.
[01:26:12.991 --> 01:26:13.972]  That happened last week!
[01:26:17.412 --> 01:26:19.894]  And we're still here waiting for them to do it again!
[01:26:19.954 --> 01:26:24.017]  You think I want to go on the air and call out the Secret Service head and say he's the number one suspect?
[01:26:24.257 --> 01:26:25.398]  I believe he planned it with Mayorkas?
[01:26:25.598 --> 01:26:26.919]  That makes me a target!
[01:26:27.279 --> 01:26:29.360]  But I'll do it because somebody's got to do it!
[01:26:32.062 --> 01:26:33.123]  Oh, that sounds radical!
[01:26:33.243 --> 01:26:35.324]  Sounds radical, they just did it in front of you!
[01:26:35.384 --> 01:26:38.627]  My God, 99.9% chance it was staged by them!
[01:26:40.388 --> 01:26:44.851]  And they're already incompetent if it's the 1 tenth of 1% chance, so they deserve to be blamed for it!
[01:26:52.412 --> 01:26:54.973]  So, we gotta keep them trying to kill Trump on the front burner.
[01:26:56.774 --> 01:27:01.036]  And I told you, they're gonna start wars, stock market crashes to make you forget about this.
[01:27:02.116 --> 01:27:09.579]  They've tried everything they could, folks, because he won the election, even with their margin of fraud of 10% or so, when they tried to kill him and they failed.
[01:27:09.619 --> 01:27:11.400]  That was a big deal.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:17.883]  And if we don't thank God every day for that, and if we don't continue to put that front and center, we're stupid.
[01:27:20.632 --> 01:27:22.013]  So I got a bunch of other news I want to hit.
[01:27:22.053 --> 01:27:24.836]  Nick Fuentes is coming up to cover the waterfront.
[01:27:25.056 --> 01:27:26.718]  Very controversial talk show host.
[01:27:27.278 --> 01:27:29.060]  But people attack him compared to the liberals.
[01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:30.561]  He's like, you know, a leftist.
[01:27:30.581 --> 01:27:33.544]  He's like, whites are the devil, need to all be killed, and are Satan.
[01:27:34.025 --> 01:27:35.846]  And this guy says whites should stand up for themselves.
[01:27:35.886 --> 01:27:42.813]  So I'm kind of like, you know, well, you're the guys who put us in this position.
[01:27:44.764 --> 01:27:48.365]  You're the guys doing all this, the ADL, the rest of it, so what do you expect?
[01:27:48.425 --> 01:27:51.806]  Yeah, it's good for people to stop being beat over the head with guilt all day.
[01:27:52.226 --> 01:27:53.187]  Maybe Nick goes too far.
[01:27:53.207 --> 01:27:54.027]  I think he does sometimes.
[01:27:54.467 --> 01:27:55.687]  I'm more of a Tommy Robinson guy.
[01:27:56.328 --> 01:27:58.268]  He's not anti-Israel, so he gets called all these names.
[01:27:58.548 --> 01:28:01.469]  That guy's been around 15 years being put in prison for the truth.
[01:28:01.529 --> 01:28:02.410]  He's 100% real.
[01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:05.751]  There's real people out there.
[01:28:09.121 --> 01:28:12.922]  But I can respect folks that are honest about what they believe and what they stand for.
[01:28:12.942 --> 01:28:15.703]  In fact, I sent you guys, or maybe I did, the Nick Fointest tweet.
[01:28:16.844 --> 01:28:20.365]  It's when I said he was coming on at like 10.30 this morning.
[01:28:20.405 --> 01:28:25.806]  I reposted one of his tweets about Europe and England and the invasion and what's happening.
[01:28:25.906 --> 01:28:27.547]  Print me that.
[01:28:27.567 --> 01:28:29.328]  Not my tweet saying he's coming on.
[01:28:29.388 --> 01:28:31.288]  I posted his tweet below it.
[01:28:31.788 --> 01:28:32.349]  I want that tweet.
[01:28:32.369 --> 01:28:33.309]  I want to read that when he comes on.
[01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:52.407]  So, the old system's going down, the new system's coming in, and the globalists are Ponzi scheme operators, and if they don't have new Ponzi schemes and new crises to keep us distracted and diverted, they're going to lose control.
[01:28:52.947 --> 01:28:55.390]  And that makes them extremely dangerous and cornered.
[01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:59.654]  And that's how I've been able to predict what they're going to do next, because it's all they've got left.
[01:29:00.913 --> 01:29:02.915]  They've only got certain bullets in their gun, folks.
[01:29:03.435 --> 01:29:09.400]  Power outages, cyber attacks, stock market crashes, terror attacks, wars, new viruses.
[01:29:11.422 --> 01:29:13.163]  Stocks tumble around the world.
[01:29:13.223 --> 01:29:14.084]  Dow down 900.
[01:29:14.164 --> 01:29:17.787]  Nikkei biggest route since Black Monday at 87.
[01:29:18.448 --> 01:29:20.229]  Magnificent 7 shed 1 trillion.
[01:29:20.609 --> 01:29:21.970]  Recession odds climb.
[01:29:22.011 --> 01:29:23.031]  Emergency rate cut.
[01:29:23.372 --> 01:29:24.753]  Trading platforms crash.
[01:29:25.854 --> 01:29:27.235]  Been a recession for years, folks.
[01:29:32.122 --> 01:29:39.569]  So, the deep state just tried to kill our populist president, who's against their policies.
[01:29:42.872 --> 01:29:44.314]  They're going to do it again.
[01:29:44.334 --> 01:29:46.216]  That's a no-brainer.
[01:29:47.837 --> 01:29:49.299]  So, what do we do to stop that?
[01:29:50.953 --> 01:29:54.875]  Well, we get on the offensive informationally against the deep state that did it.
[01:29:55.195 --> 01:29:59.258]  The Justice Department, the Secret Service, the CIA, the FBI leadership.
[01:29:59.738 --> 01:30:01.119]  We don't blame the rank-and-file people.
[01:30:01.159 --> 01:30:03.320]  We don't attack the FBI or any of these people.
[01:30:04.301 --> 01:30:09.804]  But we attack the lies and the bare minimum criminal negligence that went on.
[01:30:11.265 --> 01:30:15.747]  Or, they just feel confident to do it again.
[01:30:15.767 --> 01:30:19.730]  And I've seen a lot of traction towards exposing this.
[01:30:20.472 --> 01:30:21.273]  A lot of good news.
[01:30:22.254 --> 01:30:25.636]  So I'm not saying we're losing the info war, but we're barely winning.
[01:30:27.118 --> 01:30:31.221]  And I'm not betting my life because I think we're losers.
[01:30:31.361 --> 01:30:38.688]  I'm not betting my name, my treasure, my family, everything I am, because it's just fun to risk my life.
[01:30:38.808 --> 01:30:40.890]  We are very close to kicking their ass.
[01:30:41.890 --> 01:30:47.035]  But if we cannot assess and admit the deep shit we're in, we're done.
[01:30:50.151 --> 01:30:56.236]  Somebody starts, no reason, in a parking lot, beating the living snot out of you, and you sit there and say, well, maybe this isn't really happening.
[01:30:56.276 --> 01:30:56.936]  You're dead.
[01:30:58.697 --> 01:31:00.319]  But if you go, well, I just got knocked upside the head.
[01:31:00.359 --> 01:31:01.920]  I better turn it on right now.
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:03.121]  You can turn it on.
[01:31:03.161 --> 01:31:03.901]  You can win the fight.
[01:31:04.842 --> 01:31:07.584]  But you're getting your... We're getting our heads beat in, folks.
[01:31:08.665 --> 01:31:09.506]  And I believe in you.
[01:31:09.706 --> 01:31:10.526]  I know who you are.
[01:31:10.887 --> 01:31:11.647]  I know you're strong.
[01:31:11.667 --> 01:31:12.428]  I know you're not cowards.
[01:31:12.448 --> 01:31:13.068]  You've been asleep.
[01:31:14.049 --> 01:31:15.030]  I've been asleep partially.
[01:31:16.479 --> 01:31:18.579]  But you gotta face the time you're living in.
[01:31:18.599 --> 01:31:19.580]  You gotta admit it.
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:21.680]  We're not happy about this, but we're in it.
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:23.180]  This is it.
[01:31:47.239 --> 01:31:49.079]  Inside the Kill Box is a documentary.
[01:31:49.119 --> 01:31:50.360]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:51.940]  Get it and share it right now.
[01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:55.801]  Also posted on RELAX Shows on X. Investigating the assassination attempt.
[01:31:55.821 --> 01:31:56.741]  Here's Inside the Kill Box.
[01:31:57.062 --> 01:32:00.322]  We'll play a few minutes of this comeback with more news when Nick Fuentes joins us.
[01:32:00.342 --> 01:32:00.702]  Here it is.
[01:32:01.883 --> 01:32:06.184]  Heart racing, the assassin holds his breath and looks down the scope at President Trump.
[01:32:06.764 --> 01:32:10.545]  People scream he's got a gun as police officers surround the building.
[01:32:11.355 --> 01:32:12.475]  But no one has stopped him.
[01:32:13.035 --> 01:32:14.896]  Just a football field away from the president.
[01:32:15.396 --> 01:32:18.336]  Countersnipers see the threat, but have not engaged.
[01:32:18.757 --> 01:32:20.317]  The trigger is pulled.
[01:32:20.877 --> 01:32:22.557]  A bullet rips through Trump's ear.
[01:32:23.017 --> 01:32:27.758]  Blood splatters Trump's MAGA hat and pours down the side of his face into his hands.
[01:32:28.378 --> 01:32:30.679]  Several more bullets riddle the stage.
[01:32:31.219 --> 01:32:33.519]  Countersniper teams engage and miss.
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:35.560]  Then, hit.
[01:32:36.983 --> 01:32:39.924]  Trump rises in defiance, fist in the air.
[01:32:40.525 --> 01:32:41.385]  Fight.
[01:32:41.565 --> 01:32:41.885]  Fight.
[01:32:42.786 --> 01:32:43.126]  Fight.
[01:32:44.587 --> 01:32:48.088]  Twenty seconds in Pennsylvania will change America forever.
[01:32:48.569 --> 01:32:50.109]  Yet the government has told us nothing.
[01:32:50.569 --> 01:32:55.792]  In fact, the Secret Service has lied to the American people multiple times about that day.
[01:32:56.483 --> 01:32:57.865]  We needed answers.
[01:32:58.166 --> 01:33:02.493]  So our team traveled to Butler, Pennsylvania, the assassination site.
[01:33:03.034 --> 01:33:06.780]  What we found is worse than you can possibly imagine.
[01:33:07.721 --> 01:33:09.784]  This is the Trump Kill Box.
[01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:16.695]  Our first stop in this investigation was Washington, D.C.
[01:33:17.035 --> 01:33:24.297]  to pick up two experts in counter-sniper operations and tactical threat engagement, who also happen to have constitutional oversight of the Secret Service.
[01:33:24.797 --> 01:33:29.018]  Congressman Eli Crane is a qualified lead sniper for his SEAL Team 3 platoon.
[01:33:29.558 --> 01:33:36.180]  Congressman Cory Mills ran counter-sniper operations serving in the Army 82nd Airborne Division and the State Department.
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:41.223]  Both men have been shot at in war zones and shot back successfully.
[01:33:41.843 --> 01:33:42.704]  I want to get the facts.
[01:33:42.844 --> 01:33:44.985]  I want to be a bipartisan, full investigation.
[01:33:45.246 --> 01:33:50.109]  But I don't want this to be one of those where we over classify it so the American people don't have the transparency.
[01:33:50.229 --> 01:33:50.409]  Yeah.
[01:33:50.429 --> 01:33:59.134]  Because they deserve to see this to be able to, one, have confidence that it wasn't something that was an inside job or it wasn't something that was just negligence or it wasn't dereliction of duty.
[01:33:59.655 --> 01:34:02.877]  But that they actually can say, I know that my president
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:08.582]  Future presidents are actually going to be protected and safe whenever death threats and other types of risks are there.
[01:34:08.723 --> 01:34:11.584]  And here's how it happened and what we're going to do to prevent it in the future.
[01:34:11.864 --> 01:34:24.550]  When you get out on that site, if you have even an iota of training on security, long distance shooting, and you get on that property, I mean, you see a water tower that covers the entire premises, basically.
[01:34:24.831 --> 01:34:29.473]  You start asking yourself, why the hell wasn't anybody up on that water tower?
[01:34:29.953 --> 01:34:35.757]  So that's what we intend to do with this video, to establish from an expert perspective, what are the questions, right?
[01:34:35.797 --> 01:34:37.158]  How many answers will we get?
[01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:37.758]  I'm not sure.
[01:34:37.838 --> 01:34:43.682]  We're not going there with subpoena power and law enforcement to kick in doors, but we can go look and see and ask questions.
[01:34:44.283 --> 01:34:47.425]  So these are the questions that I want to sort of open the table up for.
[01:34:47.745 --> 01:34:50.767]  What are the biggest gaps or holes that you men see right now?
[01:34:51.067 --> 01:34:54.549]  Definitely I want to know why there wasn't counter snipers on the tower.
[01:34:54.789 --> 01:35:02.332]  I want to know who made the call to send the shooters or the security team outside of that second story window that had clear coverage over the shooter.
[01:35:03.532 --> 01:35:11.095]  I also want to know where this young 20-year-old kid with no military experience got his training because I'm hearing he had advanced explosives.
[01:35:11.376 --> 01:35:18.358]  I mean at the end of the day we've got to figure out how a 20-year-old kid acting alone by himself got within 150 yards
[01:35:19.759 --> 01:35:26.401]  It's one of the most powerful, one of the most loved, but also one of the most hated individuals on the entire planet.
[01:35:27.161 --> 01:35:28.401]  I have only been here 10 seconds.
[01:35:28.921 --> 01:35:41.925]  I am blown away by the fact that there is no law enforcement, there's no government investigators, there's no Secret Service, nothing's cordoned off, nobody seems to have any, like, specific interest in investigating anything.
[01:35:41.945 --> 01:35:46.586]  You'd assume there'd be a crime scene of the century, right?
[01:35:47.719 --> 01:35:47.919]  Nope.
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:55.585]  While on the ground, we are going to investigate five fatal security failures that created the conditions for Trump to get shot.
[01:35:56.343 --> 01:36:04.745]  Rooftop kill zones, security dead zones, Overwatch the sniper's nest, and communications collapse.
[01:36:05.425 --> 01:36:08.765]  All of these elements combine into what the military calls a kill box.
[01:36:09.345 --> 01:36:15.127]  A kill box is a three-dimensional target area designed to facilitate maximum likelihood of a casualty event.
[01:36:15.747 --> 01:36:18.627]  On July 13th, Trump was in the kill box.
[01:36:19.167 --> 01:36:20.688]  This is shockingly close.
[01:36:21.008 --> 01:36:22.948]  Officer on the roof would have prevented this entirely.
[01:36:23.628 --> 01:36:29.532]  The first location to investigate was the Secret Service sniper's nest atop the red barns behind Trump.
[01:36:30.072 --> 01:36:34.535]  The assassin, Thomas Crooks, was an obvious person of interest to law enforcement.
[01:36:34.895 --> 01:36:46.783]  He was denied entry to the Trump event by Secret Service and had been flagged by local police for skulking around the AGR manufacturing building with a rangefinder 90 minutes before the shooting.
[01:36:47.449 --> 01:36:54.415]  He accessed the roof by climbing up on an air conditioning unit and traversing the interconnected rooftops with a backpack.
[01:36:54.975 --> 01:36:59.319]  His movements were slow, lumbering, and obvious to anyone with a line of sight.
[01:36:59.959 --> 01:37:06.404]  Crooks even pointed a gun at police officers and rally goers alike who were filming him from the ground.
[01:37:06.664 --> 01:37:07.525]  Let's stop right there.
[01:37:07.765 --> 01:37:10.167]  This is an excellent 20-minute documentary.
[01:37:11.408 --> 01:37:12.970]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:37:12.990 --> 01:37:14.150]  It's inside the Kill Box.
[01:37:14.191 --> 01:37:15.351]  Great job, Benny Johnson.
[01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:20.242]  And I just feel so good knowing InfoWars has been pinned down the last few years under attack.
[01:37:20.722 --> 01:37:22.183]  We would have done reports like this in the past.
[01:37:22.203 --> 01:37:25.644]  We will again soon, one way or another, as we build back up.
[01:37:25.684 --> 01:37:26.485]  Thanks for your support.
[01:37:26.525 --> 01:37:29.386]  But it's really, really important.
[01:37:29.606 --> 01:37:35.209]  And members of Congress coming right out to Ronald Roe and saying, you know, did you try to kill Trump?
[01:37:35.969 --> 01:37:37.290]  Because that's what they did.
[01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:41.932]  150 yards, the closest building, nobody on it.
[01:37:42.752 --> 01:37:44.253]  And the guys crawling around with a gun.
[01:37:45.492 --> 01:37:46.693]  He's there for 90 minutes.
[01:37:46.713 --> 01:37:47.994]  He's on the roof for 26 minutes.
[01:37:48.054 --> 01:37:49.234]  Everybody's going, man with a gun!
[01:37:49.274 --> 01:37:49.835]  Man with a gun!
[01:37:49.855 --> 01:37:53.657]  And they asked who did this.
[01:37:53.737 --> 01:37:54.758]  It was Ronald Rowe.
[01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:00.302]  I mean, it's preponderance of evidence.
[01:38:00.582 --> 01:38:01.282]  It's all there.
[01:38:01.943 --> 01:38:02.623]  They did this.
[01:38:03.764 --> 01:38:05.885]  You can't have incompetence this bad, folks.
[01:38:07.266 --> 01:38:08.147]  They had a stand down.
[01:38:08.167 --> 01:38:13.090]  And... They're gonna do it again?
[01:38:15.185 --> 01:38:16.906]  And I'm gonna really hate it when Trump gets killed.
[01:38:16.926 --> 01:38:19.327]  Everybody's like, oh wow, you were right.
[01:38:20.748 --> 01:38:26.211]  But, you know, and I'm saying that so we pay attention and we stop it, but as of today, he's dead.
[01:38:28.613 --> 01:38:30.114]  And I said that in the weeks before they tried to kill him.
[01:38:30.374 --> 01:38:32.755]  I said, imminently they're gonna try to kill Trump, on air.
[01:38:33.916 --> 01:38:41.440]  And I'm telling you now, imminently, they're going to try to kill him again, and the odds are they won't mess up this time.
[01:38:42.221 --> 01:38:43.902]  Or they may do a truck bomb or something like that.
[01:38:44.707 --> 01:38:46.929]  Blow up his airplane, use a drone, poison him.
[01:38:47.369 --> 01:38:48.270]  I mean, the sky's the limit.
[01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:50.052]  You wake up, hear Trump's had a heart attack and dead.
[01:38:50.412 --> 01:38:50.833]  They killed him.
[01:38:53.775 --> 01:38:55.237]  Stop letting them tell you the reality.
[01:38:55.257 --> 01:39:01.282]  You see the trajectory of all the attacks, and all the lawfare, and them saying they want to kill him, and then they try to do it.
[01:39:02.223 --> 01:39:06.106]  There's a clear stand down, and we sit here and go, oh gee, I wonder what's going on here.
[01:39:06.226 --> 01:39:08.388]  I don't know.
[01:39:12.486 --> 01:39:18.729]  Day one, when Iran attacked Israel on October 7th, I said, that's Hezbollah funding Hamas, and Israel stood down.
[01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:20.110]  I just called like I saw it.
[01:39:20.670 --> 01:39:27.774]  Not being pro-Iran, not being pro-Israel, just agnostically saying, clear, stand down, and by the way, Hezbollah's behind it, and that all came out.
[01:39:28.074 --> 01:39:34.218]  Israel stood down, Hezbollah was behind it, Iran was behind it, our government gave money, what's going on behind the scenes?
[01:39:34.358 --> 01:39:36.679]  I don't know the answer to that, but I know how to look at something.
[01:39:38.697 --> 01:39:40.357]  You had military bases ten minutes away.
[01:39:40.778 --> 01:39:42.378]  Helicopter bases ten minutes away.
[01:39:42.978 --> 01:39:43.718]  Five minutes by air.
[01:39:44.059 --> 01:39:47.360]  They just sat there for seven and a half hours with their thumbs up their butts.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:55.542]  Stand down in Israel, which they admit, Netanyahu says, once the war is won, we'll investigate.
[01:39:56.062 --> 01:39:56.762]  It'll never be won.
[01:39:56.802 --> 01:39:57.542]  It's gonna go on forever.
[01:39:58.683 --> 01:39:59.503]  It's the same thing here.
[01:39:59.523 --> 01:40:06.125]  And we're on the verge of a huge expansion of the war with Israel and Iran.
[01:40:07.841 --> 01:40:12.603]  For all I know, they're sitting on the telephone making jokes about all this and rigging it against their own populations.
[01:40:13.864 --> 01:40:15.004]  Because that's how governments work.
[01:40:17.045 --> 01:40:26.649]  If you go back to the Norman times, in the last thousand years, there's letters that are famous where you'd have, you know, the Normans in France, the Normans in England, they're all cousins.
[01:40:28.370 --> 01:40:30.431]  And they're like, yeah, we're having an uprising, it's time for a war.
[01:40:33.243 --> 01:40:36.264]  Even the movie The King that came out like 10 years ago is really good.
[01:40:36.644 --> 01:40:37.244]  It's historic.
[01:40:38.065 --> 01:40:42.746]  And at the end, the king finds out it was all staged.
[01:40:43.707 --> 01:40:46.128]  They go, well, sir, we staged this war to get you more power.
[01:40:46.548 --> 01:40:48.188]  And he kills the first minister that did it.
[01:40:48.669 --> 01:40:49.449]  That's the true story.
[01:40:50.749 --> 01:40:54.791]  But the point is, is we have to grow up
[01:40:56.001 --> 01:40:58.522]  And I don't think it's that connected.
[01:40:58.582 --> 01:41:05.105]  It's more like Iran's all Machiavellian, sick in the mind, and the Israeli leadership's all Machiavellian, sick in the mind.
[01:41:06.986 --> 01:41:10.387]  But the left's allied with Islam, but then it was always killing them.
[01:41:11.647 --> 01:41:13.648]  They're using groups against each other.
[01:41:14.969 --> 01:41:16.129]  That's my view of what's happening.
[01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:20.171]  Meanwhile, we're told two weeks ago that J.D.
[01:41:20.211 --> 01:41:21.511]  Vance is having sex with a couch.
[01:41:22.292 --> 01:41:23.932]  Now, I don't cover this because I'm defending J.D.
[01:41:23.952 --> 01:41:24.853]  Vance, who I think's a great guy.
[01:41:26.078 --> 01:41:31.302]  I'm covering this because they tell you he's having sex with a couch and litter but it's not true.
[01:41:31.802 --> 01:41:36.105]  And then now he's got eyeliner on?
[01:41:37.065 --> 01:41:37.886]  Or whatever you call it?
[01:41:39.144 --> 01:41:50.106]  And then they show the photos on the National News and say, because somebody, because they just said it online, oh look, we'll put it on screen please, look in this photo, his eyebrows look lighter, and in that photo they look darker.
[01:41:50.386 --> 01:41:51.907]  It's called shadows.
[01:41:52.607 --> 01:41:54.327]  It's called the light on his face.
[01:41:55.207 --> 01:41:56.948]  Yeah, go through the Daily Mail article, I'll send it to you.
[01:41:58.208 --> 01:41:59.448]  And they go, why does he look different here?
[01:41:59.948 --> 01:42:03.949]  Well, there's different lenses, there's different light, he's inside, he's outside, or I guess I can just show you.
[01:42:04.689 --> 01:42:06.870]  We'll just do it off, I have the printout right here, no problem.
[01:42:07.884 --> 01:42:08.584]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:42:09.485 --> 01:42:11.486]  So, they'll go, oh look!
[01:42:13.026 --> 01:42:13.767]  It looks different.
[01:42:13.807 --> 01:42:16.228]  I mean, what does that even mean?
[01:42:18.049 --> 01:42:18.609]  Keep going through.
[01:42:19.889 --> 01:42:22.270]  So, we're on the edge of total financial collapse.
[01:42:22.391 --> 01:42:23.191]  World War III.
[01:42:24.572 --> 01:42:25.232]  Open borders.
[01:42:25.772 --> 01:42:26.913]  Giant human trafficking.
[01:42:27.073 --> 01:42:27.933]  Here, overhead shot right here.
[01:42:27.953 --> 01:42:28.613]  I'll just show it this way.
[01:42:28.673 --> 01:42:29.174]  I'll show it this way.
[01:42:29.214 --> 01:42:29.594]  Overhead shot.
[01:42:30.374 --> 01:42:33.455]  And then, the big story everywhere is this J.D.
[01:42:33.495 --> 01:42:34.256]  Vance wearing
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:40.644]  Like I guess a lady in an old truck stop or whatever, you know, where they draw their eyebrows on.
[01:42:41.024 --> 01:42:47.610]  Is JD Vance drawing... Oh look, why they look light here and then here in a dark room they look dark?
[01:42:47.770 --> 01:42:49.211]  Because the light's on top of his head.
[01:42:49.251 --> 01:42:50.212]  What the hell do you think?
[01:42:51.453 --> 01:42:54.056]  So we're talking about JD Vance's eyebrows here.
[01:42:57.739 --> 01:42:59.481]  And just like him having sex with the couch.
[01:43:01.144 --> 01:43:01.704]  It's not true.
[01:43:02.444 --> 01:43:04.785]  But see, Alex Jones went and peed on graves.
[01:43:05.185 --> 01:43:07.046]  Alex Jones made money off dead kids.
[01:43:07.126 --> 01:43:08.906]  Alex, I barely even talked about those people.
[01:43:09.167 --> 01:43:15.809]  They took my identity, signed me up for all their crap, used me for fundraising.
[01:43:15.869 --> 01:43:17.669]  When I say signed me up, put me in their lawsuits.
[01:43:19.650 --> 01:43:22.171]  And then run around and go, he's being mean to us!
[01:43:22.231 --> 01:43:22.631]  J.D.
[01:43:22.691 --> 01:43:24.511]  Vance is having sex with couches!
[01:43:25.432 --> 01:43:25.812]  J.D.
[01:43:25.932 --> 01:43:29.333]  Vance's eyebrows are dark one day and light the next.
[01:43:32.355 --> 01:43:34.837]  It all depends if you're like me with light brown hair.
[01:43:34.857 --> 01:43:37.499]  If you're in the summer, they're a little lighter because you're out in the sun.
[01:43:37.519 --> 01:43:38.860]  In the winter, my eyebrows get darker.
[01:43:39.912 --> 01:43:41.953]  Because I'm in the sun in the summer.
[01:43:42.273 --> 01:43:43.313]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:43:43.533 --> 01:43:44.693]  We're talking about J.D.
[01:43:44.753 --> 01:43:45.733]  Vance's eyebrows.
[01:43:46.094 --> 01:43:50.575]  Who cares if the makeup artist wanted to sit there and darken his eyebrows or something?
[01:43:51.275 --> 01:43:54.896]  I think once or twice I was on national TV and a woman went like, let's darken your eyebrows.
[01:43:54.916 --> 01:43:55.776]  It was like with a pen.
[01:43:55.816 --> 01:43:56.676]  I'm like, no, I don't do that.
[01:43:57.256 --> 01:44:00.157]  But the point is, is that it doesn't matter.
[01:44:00.537 --> 01:44:01.177]  Does J.D.
[01:44:01.237 --> 01:44:03.358]  Vance's eyebrows matter or his policies?
[01:44:08.078 --> 01:44:11.982]  Absolutely, totally insane.
[01:44:12.842 --> 01:44:13.943]  And they say we're weird.
[01:44:16.586 --> 01:44:24.433]  So, meanwhile in the UK, while Islamists are the main ones burning stuff down and attacking people, they only focus on the few white people doing something wrong.
[01:44:25.033 --> 01:44:27.656]  UK police arrest a man for offensive Facebook post.
[01:44:28.256 --> 01:44:29.117]  Kelly McBreen wrote about it.
[01:44:29.137 --> 01:44:30.939]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:44:32.150 --> 01:44:32.590]  Right now?
[01:44:33.311 --> 01:44:35.932]  A British man, let's pull the clip up, I don't know, I think I sent it to you.
[01:44:36.512 --> 01:44:44.256]  A British man filmed a pair of police officers entering his home and arresting him for improper use of electronic communication network under the Communications Act.
[01:44:44.576 --> 01:44:51.120]  A female cop stood in the man's living room and explained he was being hauled into the police station over some comments he made on Facebook page.
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:53.121]  Oh, Facebook is a crime?
[01:44:53.161 --> 01:44:53.761]  The man asked.
[01:44:57.443 --> 01:44:59.184]  Am I going to be locked up for the night?
[01:44:59.324 --> 01:45:01.165]  Do I need to bring my medications?
[01:45:01.917 --> 01:45:06.442]  Welcome to 2024 Britain, where the police arrive at your home to arrest you for comments made on Facebook.
[01:45:08.003 --> 01:45:12.288]  As Britain ascends into lawless chaos, the government's priority clearly isn't fixing it.
[01:45:13.069 --> 01:45:14.350]  England is the beta test.
[01:45:14.370 --> 01:45:15.231]  We have the video of that, guys?
[01:45:19.936 --> 01:45:20.477]  We do have it.
[01:45:20.657 --> 01:45:21.217]  Okay, great.
[01:45:21.518 --> 01:45:21.898]  Wonderful.
[01:45:22.599 --> 01:45:23.500]  Let's go ahead and roll that then.
[01:45:24.943 --> 01:45:27.984]  So, um... What do you mean I can't have any alcohol?
[01:45:28.144 --> 01:45:29.464]  Okay, well, I'll tell you.
[01:45:29.745 --> 01:45:31.645]  Okay, the times, uh, 20 to 3, 1440.
[01:45:32.405 --> 01:45:39.948]  I'm arresting you on suspicion of improper use of the electronic, uh, communications network.
[01:45:40.008 --> 01:45:40.548]  I'm just... Fuck!
[01:45:42.762 --> 01:45:44.643]  So I'm actually being arrested?
[01:45:44.763 --> 01:45:45.903]  Oh, really?
[01:45:45.943 --> 01:45:47.604]  Oh, it's a Facebook crime, is it?
[01:45:47.644 --> 01:45:47.824]  Right.
[01:45:47.864 --> 01:45:48.064]  Right.
[01:46:13.225 --> 01:46:18.109]  So here she is, incriminating him.
[01:46:18.329 --> 01:46:19.430]  Don't answer her questions.
[01:46:21.431 --> 01:46:29.958]  And they're priming the pump to put you in these FEMA camps they built all over the world under the guise of lockdowns.
[01:46:30.158 --> 01:46:34.021]  By the way, Peter Hotez says the UN troops should occupy America.
[01:46:42.246 --> 01:46:44.747]  Can you tell me what this comment was?
[01:46:44.867 --> 01:46:48.208]  Alright, so what am I going to be locked up for the night or?
[01:46:48.228 --> 01:46:49.809]  Right, do I need to take my medications with me?
[01:46:50.089 --> 01:46:51.250]  When do you need to take them?
[01:47:03.175 --> 01:47:10.382]  Well, I've got pain medications, I've got sleeping medications, I've got anxiety medications, which I might take one of those in a bit.
[01:47:10.783 --> 01:47:12.164]  Alright, so let's stop right here.
[01:47:13.305 --> 01:47:19.732]  So, in the UK, in Canada, in Australia, in Europe, the police are literally nanny state arresting everybody.
[01:47:20.412 --> 01:47:23.816]  But in the future, they will hand you over to goons and blow the back of your head off.
[01:47:25.046 --> 01:47:26.487]  They built death camps everywhere.
[01:47:26.507 --> 01:47:29.948]  These are just death camp operators who don't even know in the future.
[01:47:29.968 --> 01:47:30.689]  They'll just take you.
[01:47:30.789 --> 01:47:32.910]  Everybody used to, hey, we just arrest you for your speech.
[01:47:34.471 --> 01:47:45.136]  And I've got Peter Hotez coming up saying we need to use NATO and UN troops in America to arrest anti-vaxxers at a UN meeting.
[01:47:48.017 --> 01:47:49.598]  They want to war people.
[01:47:51.195 --> 01:47:53.937]  And they will do human trafficking, you name it.
[01:47:53.997 --> 01:47:56.418]  They'll do anything.
[01:47:56.458 --> 01:47:57.639]  These are monsters.
[01:47:57.659 --> 01:48:03.143]  This is an organized, Soros, satanic, New World Order takeover.
[01:48:04.143 --> 01:48:06.225]  And if we just admit it's happening and say, no, it's over.
[01:48:06.565 --> 01:48:08.726]  But if you won't admit how much trouble you're in, we're doomed.
[01:48:09.467 --> 01:48:11.328]  Now, I need your support.
[01:48:11.488 --> 01:48:12.349]  Plus, we have great products.

[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:29.426]  Our sponsors at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:49:00.615 --> 01:49:09.370]  All right, I'm going to get Nick Fuentes on right now, but first I want to air a very important John Bowne report when we come back.
[01:49:10.492 --> 01:49:13.557]  UK groomer gangs fuel globalist chaos.
[01:49:14.431 --> 01:49:20.354]  We'll come on to tomorrow's news today, and then SP1, and then Nick Fuentes set to join us, hour number three.
[01:49:21.034 --> 01:49:28.538]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[01:49:29.159 --> 01:49:31.360]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:42.289]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation, and that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[01:49:42.610 --> 01:49:48.775]  And I'm asking you now, at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,
[01:49:49.696 --> 01:49:58.361]  To double down and support the broadcast more than ever, to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:49:58.561 --> 01:50:07.646]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[01:50:08.046 --> 01:50:09.146]  These are very, very popular.
[01:50:09.186 --> 01:50:10.267]  And I went and looked it up online.
[01:50:10.687 --> 01:50:11.608]  It is very, very popular.
[01:50:12.188 --> 01:50:13.928]  It's not an investment, it's a collectible.
[01:50:14.129 --> 01:50:21.030]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:50:21.490 --> 01:50:25.511]  Best group out there, highest ratings, amazing prices, the best.
[01:50:25.731 --> 01:50:29.792]  This is a collectible and a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[01:50:30.332 --> 01:50:39.975]  Then the bankruptcy started and the people that came in from the courts said, we're not going to keep outside people's products in here, in your store, and they kicked him back
[01:50:41.118 --> 01:50:44.860]  Uh, to the folks, despite the fact we already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:56.227]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[01:50:56.827 --> 01:51:05.214]  Infowars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[01:51:05.714 --> 01:51:15.943]  Stock up on 24 karat .999 pure gold in the most popular size of one-tenth gram, an affordable sleek card that fits your wallet, drawer, glove compartment, and is easy to travel with.

[01:51:21.327 --> 01:51:22.488]  Bar of gold in there.
[01:51:22.508 --> 01:51:25.649]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Infowar.
[01:51:25.949 --> 01:51:31.991]  You'll have a historical memento as a keepsake for yourself, your family, for your children, and your grandchildren.
[01:51:32.011 --> 01:51:33.652]  Because this is a historic fight.
[01:51:34.052 --> 01:51:37.873]  And this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[01:51:38.233 --> 01:51:39.534]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[01:51:40.194 --> 01:51:43.095]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[01:51:43.655 --> 01:51:46.655]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[01:51:47.016 --> 01:51:51.877]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[01:51:52.237 --> 01:51:54.337]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[01:51:55.137 --> 01:52:01.119]  We've only got a few thousand of these left, and I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[01:52:01.159 --> 01:52:01.739]  Now, I want to be clear.
[01:52:02.299 --> 01:52:04.499]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[01:52:04.519 --> 01:52:05.240]  That's not what this is.
[01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:06.340]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:20.045]  This is like, on NPR, that still gets taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug to cost them $5, or a baseball cap to cost them $10, and you make a $100 donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the New World Order.
[01:52:20.325 --> 01:52:21.246]  I know you don't want to do that.
[01:52:21.986 --> 01:52:26.808]  This costs, I think they told me, more than $10 per card, something like that, $10 or $11, and so the other
[01:52:29.789 --> 01:52:32.350]  $80-something dollars will go to fund the operation.
[01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:35.530]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[01:52:36.050 --> 01:52:43.732]  So, get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[01:52:44.112 --> 01:52:45.212]  The decision is yours.
[01:52:45.652 --> 01:52:46.692]  This is a limited edition.
[01:52:47.272 --> 01:52:52.273]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[01:52:52.293 --> 01:52:57.254]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time.
[01:52:57.554 --> 01:52:58.395]  Thank you for your support.
[01:52:58.415 --> 01:52:59.956]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[01:53:21.255 --> 01:53:23.398]  All right, Nick Fuentes joins us for the hour.
[01:53:23.418 --> 01:53:26.281]  I want him to give us a prelude of what he wants to cover first.
[01:53:26.342 --> 01:53:36.014]  I want to get into Iran, the stock market crash, the riots in England and Ireland, and just everything else he sees with the campaign.
[01:53:36.074 --> 01:53:37.015]  Nick, good to have you here.
[01:53:37.055 --> 01:53:38.116]  We appreciate your time.
[01:53:38.657 --> 01:53:39.979]  And coming on, where do you want to start?
[01:53:41.519 --> 01:53:42.820]  Hey Alex, good to be with you.
[01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:46.243]  Well, I suppose the best place to start is Iran.
[01:53:46.443 --> 01:53:49.926]  This is maybe something that we'll be seeing even in the next couple hours.
[01:53:50.786 --> 01:53:54.569]  Before the end of the day, major strike by Iran against Israel.
[01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:56.331]  So, why don't we start there?
[01:53:58.152 --> 01:54:03.877]  Give us your breakdown and I'll show a B-roll of an artist's rendering of a giant Iranian missile strike on Israel.
[01:54:03.897 --> 01:54:04.117]  Go ahead.
[01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.290]  Sure.
[01:54:06.370 --> 01:54:13.154]  So, as you know, and I'm sure your listeners know, we're now waiting for an imminent attack by Iran against Israel.
[01:54:13.214 --> 01:54:17.337]  It'll be the second of its kind, actually, in the history of both countries.
[01:54:17.897 --> 01:54:24.381]  First one was April 13th, and this is after a series of attacks and counterattacks this past week.
[01:54:25.307 --> 01:54:28.708]  Last weekend there was a major rocket attack on the Golan Heights.
[01:54:29.409 --> 01:54:30.929]  Killed about a dozen teenagers.
[01:54:31.590 --> 01:54:36.592]  And Israel retaliated by blowing up the political leader of Hamas in Tehran.
[01:54:36.852 --> 01:54:38.832]  Killed the commander of Hezbollah in Beirut.
[01:54:39.473 --> 01:54:44.235]  And so now everybody, all eyes are on what this retaliation will look like.
[01:54:44.495 --> 01:54:48.957]  And I have a lot of confidence that this is going to be significant.
[01:54:49.237 --> 01:54:51.518]  Far more significant than the one in April.
[01:54:52.098 --> 01:54:54.759]  And I think we know that first and foremost because the timing.
[01:54:55.583 --> 01:54:56.463]  It's so much different.
[01:54:56.503 --> 01:54:58.824]  In April, Iran gave two weeks notice.
[01:54:58.904 --> 01:55:07.467]  There was a two-week lead time between Israel's attack on their consulate in Damascus and then the Iranian missile strike which came on April 13th.
[01:55:07.967 --> 01:55:15.810]  This time it's going to be a window of about five days, five, six days between Israel's attack and Iran's retaliation.
[01:55:16.610 --> 01:55:28.841]  The other thing that I think a lot of people aren't picking up on is that the United States will have forward deployed in the Strait of Hormuz two aircraft carriers, which I think speaks to the severity and gravity of the situation.
[01:55:29.461 --> 01:55:32.303]  And I talked a little bit about this on a Twitter space last night.
[01:55:33.044 --> 01:55:33.304]  I don't know.
[01:55:53.263 --> 01:55:54.264]  Could they be setting up a false flag?
[01:56:19.150 --> 01:56:19.730]  I think so.
[01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:21.011]  I think it's very possible.
[01:56:21.111 --> 01:56:26.174]  And Iran has said that they're going to target anybody that is participating in the defense of Israel.
[01:56:26.194 --> 01:56:31.776]  Of course, the first time, the first strikes back in April, it wasn't just the Iron Dome and the David Sling.
[01:56:32.077 --> 01:56:35.218]  It was also the United States, Jordan, France, the United Kingdom.
[01:56:35.578 --> 01:56:38.140]  They all participated in shooting down the missiles.
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:42.681]  This time, Egypt just announced today they will not be supporting Israel.
[01:56:43.221 --> 01:56:45.702]  Saudi Arabia may not be supporting Israel.
[01:56:46.322 --> 01:56:49.423]  And Iran has said that they will target anybody that's involved.
[01:56:50.283 --> 01:56:53.444]  Does that include the United States bases in Iraq and Syria?
[01:56:53.664 --> 01:56:54.344]  Or Jordan?
[01:56:54.745 --> 01:56:57.585]  Could it involve the aircraft carriers in the Strait of Hormuz?
[01:56:58.005 --> 01:57:00.886]  I don't think it's totally outside the realm of possibility.
[01:57:00.966 --> 01:57:05.207]  So, all signs, I think, point to a major, major escalation.
[01:57:05.227 --> 01:57:06.668]  And it's going to be far less
[01:57:07.328 --> 01:57:14.413]  Easy to de-escalate this one or choreograph something where they can save face like there was last time back in April.
[01:57:14.494 --> 01:57:16.455]  So, I think it's going to be absolutely major.
[01:57:16.475 --> 01:57:17.276]  Well, that's right.
[01:57:17.316 --> 01:57:19.577]  In April, Iran said, we consider this matter done.
[01:57:20.238 --> 01:57:22.419]  But Israel escalated again, and I agree with you totally.
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:27.263]  Parking two aircraft carriers in the Strait of Hormuz during this is asking for it.
[01:57:27.743 --> 01:57:30.305]  We'll come back in 60 seconds to elaborate on this with Nick Foley.
[01:57:30.325 --> 01:57:30.886]  Ted, stay with us.
[01:57:31.126 --> 01:57:36.050]  Well, Israel is saying that in the al-Hajj regime that they may strike Iran first.
[01:57:37.122 --> 01:57:42.525]  They think Iran's about to strike after the political and military leader of Hamas were killed.
[01:57:43.806 --> 01:57:46.648]  And we saw back in April the tit-for-tat that went on.
[01:57:46.708 --> 01:57:48.349]  Iran said they consider the matter closed.
[01:57:48.949 --> 01:57:50.230]  But now we're in election season.
[01:57:50.250 --> 01:57:51.370]  The stock market's crashing.
[01:57:52.891 --> 01:57:54.332]  Then Yahoo's in political trouble.
[01:57:55.133 --> 01:57:56.453]  And so I agree with Nick Fuentes.
[01:57:56.493 --> 01:57:57.214]  He just joined us.
[01:57:57.454 --> 01:58:00.636]  He was on last segment saying he believes it's gonna be a major strike.
[01:58:00.656 --> 01:58:03.818]  They're saying the next few hours, the next few days, we're not sure.
[01:58:05.310 --> 01:58:06.351]  Nick, this is a big deal.
[01:58:07.071 --> 01:58:10.173]  Keep elaborating on this, and that key point you made, I want you to flesh that out.
[01:58:11.854 --> 01:58:18.959]  The United States is sticking two aircraft carriers right up against the shore of Iran, right when Israel is about to strike.
[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:27.725]  And then even if Iran doesn't strike the aircraft carriers, we'll pull up a map of Sredera Moose for TV viewers.
[01:58:28.886 --> 01:58:30.747]  Could this be a USS Liberty repeat?
[01:58:33.652 --> 01:58:40.055]  I think it's certainly possible, because we know that Israel is not able to take on Hezbollah and Iran by themselves.
[01:58:40.436 --> 01:58:45.898]  They know that, we know that, and yet I believe Netanyahu seeks to expand and prolong the war.
[01:58:45.918 --> 01:58:48.180]  The only way to prolong it is to expand it.
[01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:57.806]  And they can not even defend themselves against Hezbollah and Iran, let alone do any kind of offensive in South Lebanon, which is what they've been threatening.
[01:58:58.206 --> 01:59:06.431]  And so the function of whether this conflict goes on longer and whether it goes wider is the commitment and involvement of the United States.
[01:59:06.871 --> 01:59:09.933]  The Biden administration has been very reluctant to get involved.
[01:59:10.033 --> 01:59:15.496]  And they, along with other liberal governments, it's just true, they have been trying to restrain Israel
[01:59:16.437 --> 01:59:19.382]  Putting pressure by freezing some of the weapons shipments.
[01:59:19.442 --> 01:59:20.944]  Biden's been withholding 2,000 precision bombs.
[01:59:20.965 --> 01:59:24.250]  And Netanyahu's always trying to suck us into war with Iran for 20 years.
[01:59:24.951 --> 01:59:27.094]  Iran's always two weeks from nuclear weapons for 20 years.
[01:59:28.530 --> 01:59:28.930]  That's right.
[01:59:29.050 --> 01:59:33.352]  And Republican and Democrat administrations, Israel's tried to pressure every U.S.
[01:59:33.392 --> 01:59:34.913]  president, the last four U.S.
[01:59:34.953 --> 01:59:36.593]  presidents to strike Iran.
[01:59:36.754 --> 01:59:38.294]  And this doesn't make any sense.
[01:59:38.334 --> 01:59:40.155]  This is hardly any different than Iraq.
[01:59:40.215 --> 01:59:43.096]  It's like you say, they're two weeks away for 20 years.
[01:59:43.536 --> 01:59:44.677]  And that's what they're saying now.
[01:59:45.277 --> 01:59:48.098]  And so I think that this is the go for broke.
[01:59:48.218 --> 01:59:49.819]  This is the once and for all war.
[01:59:49.839 --> 01:59:51.220]  This is how Israel sees it.
[01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:52.380]  We're good to go.
[02:00:15.385 --> 02:00:16.246]  You can print money.
[02:00:16.506 --> 02:00:18.327]  You can't print anti-missile systems.
[02:00:18.367 --> 02:00:23.049]  You can't print anti-tank missiles, which is something the United States doesn't really even make anymore.
[02:00:23.389 --> 02:00:33.234]  And so between our commitment to Ukraine, anticipating a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the last thing we need is a war in Iran, or even a prolonged commitment to defending Israel.
[02:00:33.514 --> 02:00:35.856]  I think the only thing that gets America involved
[02:00:36.636 --> 02:00:44.065]  ...is an Iranian attack on American assets, something like we haven't seen yet, or a false flag in the United States or Europe.
[02:00:44.245 --> 02:00:45.807]  And I don't think I'll... Yeah, go ahead.
[02:00:45.987 --> 02:00:46.988]  No, no, I totally agree.
[02:00:47.008 --> 02:00:49.211]  Keep elaborating, but I've got a point.
[02:00:50.620 --> 02:00:58.144]  Yeah, I was going to say, you know, a lot of people, I think, realized when the Olympics started, there was this arson attack on rail.
[02:00:58.745 --> 02:01:13.453]  It seems like that totally went under the radar, but just before the Olympics started, before the opening ceremonies, they reported there was this coordinated sabotage attack, an act of arson against the high-speed rail in France, and it totally disabled the Olympics for the first day.
[02:01:14.213 --> 02:01:19.414]  And I saw that and I've heard some of the rhetoric about Iran plotting a Trump assassination and other things.
[02:01:19.815 --> 02:01:24.136]  I don't think I'm the only one with the idea in my head that something's going to blow up.
[02:01:24.456 --> 02:01:30.918]  There's going to be some kind of mass casualty terror attack, just like, you know, you and I predicted the assassination attempt against Trump.
[02:01:31.158 --> 02:01:33.458]  There's going to be some kind of mass casualty incident.
[02:01:33.878 --> 02:01:36.299]  And in 24 hours, there'll be a media blitz.
[02:01:36.619 --> 02:01:39.300]  They'll know it's Hamas, it's Hezbollah, it's Iran.
[02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:42.901]  And that's going to be their pretext to get the United States involved.
[02:01:42.961 --> 02:01:45.483]  I think that was the play from the very beginning.
[02:01:45.643 --> 02:01:51.325]  And, you know, so far they haven't been able to get the United States to commit because there hasn't been a casus belli.
[02:01:51.666 --> 02:01:59.949]  With Iraq and Afghanistan, it was really 9-11 which propelled that authorization of use of military force and the global war on terror.
[02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:05.132]  But since there's been so much skepticism and distrust of the American regime ever since then,
[02:02:05.532 --> 02:02:08.633]  Because of the mission creep and these endless two wars.
[02:02:08.733 --> 02:02:11.334]  Afghanistan just came to a close a couple years ago.
[02:02:11.854 --> 02:02:14.334]  I thought it'd be impossible that they'd get us to war in Iran.
[02:02:15.075 --> 02:02:19.576]  Now it looks very likely, especially with all of the shooting and fighting that's going on.
[02:02:20.296 --> 02:02:23.297]  It's basically a series of proxy wars that have now gone hot.
[02:02:24.257 --> 02:02:27.500]  And we're going to talk about that, so let me throw these points in the back of what you're saying.
[02:02:27.801 --> 02:02:31.324]  That's why I knew where you were going when you started to say it, because I was thinking the same thing and I wasn't asking about it.
[02:02:31.344 --> 02:02:33.106]  Because it's history, we're looking at the same thing here.
[02:02:33.806 --> 02:02:36.769]  You have the Lusitania getting sunk that got the U.S.
[02:02:36.829 --> 02:02:45.598]  into World War I, which was all staged and it came out that it was really a flagship of the British Navy and the Germans had bought ads in the newspapers for months saying, don't sail on this, we're going to sink it.
[02:02:45.918 --> 02:02:48.620]  Then it sailed back and forth in front of the U-boats to get, you know, sunk.
[02:02:49.321 --> 02:02:54.735]  And then, of course, you have the singing of the Maine before that in 1898 to get us into the Spanish-American War in Havana Harbor.
[02:02:55.882 --> 02:02:56.422]  And all of that.
[02:02:57.042 --> 02:03:02.084]  And then you have, of course, the Gulf of Tonkin event that never happened to get us into Vietnam in 64.
[02:03:02.364 --> 02:03:07.206]  You have the USS Liberty with LBJ in control of that with Israel trying to sink the ship to blame it.
[02:03:07.446 --> 02:03:08.986]  But the ship stayed up, so they couldn't do it.
[02:03:09.006 --> 02:03:10.587]  That's another pretext for full war.
[02:03:10.927 --> 02:03:16.209]  And I interviewed Admiral Moore and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the guys that were the head of the JAG officers before they all died.
[02:03:16.289 --> 02:03:17.869]  So I made films about it.
[02:03:18.329 --> 02:03:19.150]  That was on record.
[02:03:19.170 --> 02:03:19.990]  They saw the records.
[02:03:20.450 --> 02:03:22.591]  And they would call up and say, our ship needs help.
[02:03:23.191 --> 02:03:23.271]  Yeah.
[02:03:54.042 --> 02:03:57.523]  I mean, hell, Biden's controllers have nukes on those aircraft carriers.
[02:03:57.783 --> 02:04:00.784]  They'll just activate one by satellite and nuke it and say the Iranians did.
[02:04:01.124 --> 02:04:02.305]  Now, I'm not saying that will happen.
[02:04:02.345 --> 02:04:03.545]  I'm saying that's a scenario.
[02:04:04.065 --> 02:04:19.890]  I agree with you that with the whole world going into this crisis and the globalists in so much trouble, war is always the main dish they try to serve first, then pandemics, then financial collapse, cyber attacks, and all that's already rolling out and being beta tested right now, Nick Fuentes.
[02:04:21.786 --> 02:04:22.386]  Totally right.
[02:04:22.586 --> 02:04:25.528]  And putting our aircraft carriers there is an invitation.
[02:04:25.608 --> 02:04:30.310]  It's an invitation for the interested parties to drag us into the war.
[02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:31.250]  And I don't understand.
[02:04:31.290 --> 02:04:39.814]  I mean, of course, you know, the argument nominally, ostensibly, is that those aircraft carriers are there to deter Iran.
[02:04:40.494 --> 02:04:43.195]  And from a military point of view, that sort of makes sense.
[02:04:43.255 --> 02:04:45.536]  Iran may not want to escalate the conflict.
[02:04:46.037 --> 02:04:48.438]  If there's two aircraft carriers, the signal is clear.
[02:04:49.218 --> 02:04:50.679]  We'll bomb your oil and gas fields.
[02:04:50.719 --> 02:04:52.220]  We'll bomb your nuclear complex.
[02:04:52.541 --> 02:04:53.822]  That's clearly the message.
[02:04:54.202 --> 02:05:06.732]  What it does, though, in effect, and as you know, based on history, is that it puts the United States, it situates us right in the middle of conflict where, you know, for example, where Israel wants the United States to go and assist them in this campaign.
[02:05:07.473 --> 02:05:09.194]  It's a perfect target.
[02:05:09.234 --> 02:05:10.915]  It's painting a target on our back.
[02:05:11.696 --> 02:05:15.619]  Yeah, but let's just go back to Operation Praying Mantis and blowing up other ships.
[02:05:15.659 --> 02:05:18.281]  But if you go back further than that, or after that, 9-11, we know that was an inside job.
[02:05:18.341 --> 02:05:19.843]  So it looks like they're teeing up a new 9-11.
[02:05:42.389 --> 02:05:43.871]  Precisely, because that's how it works.
[02:05:43.931 --> 02:05:46.234]  You can't go to war without the pretext.
[02:05:46.274 --> 02:05:49.778]  You can't go to war without the excuse, the big false flag attack.
[02:05:50.118 --> 02:05:51.500]  And I think that's what they're setting up.
[02:05:51.620 --> 02:05:53.662]  Israel clearly has designs on Iran.
[02:05:53.963 --> 02:05:57.767]  And make no mistake about it, this is not about October 7th, which was a tragedy.
[02:05:58.107 --> 02:05:59.769]  It's not even really about Gaza.
[02:06:00.430 --> 02:06:03.693]  What this whole thing is about is the regional balance of power.
[02:06:04.113 --> 02:06:17.823]  And Israel recognizes, as well as Saudi Arabia and the United States too, that as long as Iran exists in its current form, if it is unleashed from the sanctions regime, it will compete with these other powers.
[02:06:17.904 --> 02:06:24.649]  Iran has a huge population, a big middle class, good universities, they do have a nuclear program, they've got oil and gas.
[02:06:25.169 --> 02:06:32.333]  If they're unrestrained from the sanctions, which is what the Obama and Biden regime would do, there would be a competition in the Middle East.
[02:06:32.473 --> 02:06:34.975]  And if you go to Brzezinski... That's actually in America's interest.
[02:06:35.055 --> 02:06:38.417]  If you go to Brzezinski Political Science, Iran's at the center of the chessboard.
[02:06:41.243 --> 02:06:42.184]  That's right, that's right.
[02:06:42.224 --> 02:06:44.826]  It's the global, it's the world island, right?
[02:06:44.926 --> 02:06:53.091]  There's the world ocean and the world island and Iran being centered in the middle of all of it is the key to dominating the three continents, Eurasia and Africa.
[02:06:53.952 --> 02:06:58.776]  And so that is why all these neocon planners, that's the final plan is regime change.
[02:06:59.156 --> 02:07:01.618]  And I think it runs through a false flag in the United States or
[02:07:02.378 --> 02:07:02.779]  I don't think so.
[02:07:15.011 --> 02:07:15.431]  That's true.
[02:07:15.691 --> 02:07:16.152]  That's true.
[02:07:16.252 --> 02:07:17.812]  There will be, I'm sure, some of that.
[02:07:18.433 --> 02:07:23.255]  And with this open border, you know, there's bound to be people inside the United States that have infiltrated.
[02:07:23.375 --> 02:07:27.617]  And I don't think people are prepared psychologically for, this is not 20 years ago.
[02:07:28.337 --> 02:07:29.898]  This is not the unipolar moment.
[02:07:30.038 --> 02:07:33.079]  Would the United States even win a war against Iran?
[02:07:33.119 --> 02:07:35.260]  I think that's actually an open-ended question.
[02:07:35.681 --> 02:07:38.262]  You know, and it's just sort of like when Russia invaded Ukraine.
[02:07:38.962 --> 02:07:41.943]  There was this idea that they would steamroll Ukraine in a matter of days.
[02:07:42.303 --> 02:07:44.144]  Obviously, the situation's a little bit different.
[02:07:44.564 --> 02:07:48.326]  But 20 years on, I don't think the United States has the same competence.
[02:07:48.646 --> 02:07:51.948]  I don't think it has the same relative advantage in military size.
[02:07:52.488 --> 02:07:57.890]  If the United States engages Iran, we have to recognize we'll be engaging Iran on many, many fronts.
[02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:59.291]  We'll be engaging them at home.
[02:07:59.751 --> 02:08:02.812]  We'll be engaging them in Iraq, in Syria, in Iran.
[02:08:02.852 --> 02:08:04.713]  We'll be engaging them in the Persian Gulf.
[02:08:04.773 --> 02:08:06.194]  It'll be a war on our economy.
[02:08:06.614 --> 02:08:08.797]  In the 1980s, Iran-Iraq-U.S.
[02:08:08.837 --> 02:08:09.517]  proxy war.
[02:08:09.918 --> 02:08:10.819]  Iran was in Iran.
[02:08:11.259 --> 02:08:12.000]  They got smart.
[02:08:12.020 --> 02:08:12.661]  They're everywhere now.
[02:08:14.616 --> 02:08:15.036]  That's right.
[02:08:15.737 --> 02:08:15.957]  They are.
[02:08:16.097 --> 02:08:17.759]  They're in every country in the Middle East.
[02:08:17.799 --> 02:08:18.980]  It would be a full scale.
[02:08:19.020 --> 02:08:21.282]  That's why it's not even fair to say it's a war.
[02:08:21.342 --> 02:08:22.443]  It's a conflagration.
[02:08:22.763 --> 02:08:24.905]  It's going to be a full-on regional conflict.
[02:08:24.965 --> 02:08:30.050]  I don't think people realize the scope of all of this, and especially the effect it'll have on the economy.
[02:08:30.110 --> 02:08:36.916]  That's why it brings in the stock market crash that precipitated what we saw with the Japanese stock exchange this morning.
[02:08:37.617 --> 02:08:40.578]  NASDAQ on Friday, biggest crash in the NASDAQ today.
[02:08:41.118 --> 02:08:46.900]  What happens when all of the world's major oil producers are engaged in an all-out regional conflict?
[02:08:46.940 --> 02:08:51.742]  What happens when there's no trade going through the Strait of Hormuz or through the Red Sea?
[02:08:51.822 --> 02:08:56.364]  You know, when there's no trade going through there and there's no oil, we're already in an energy crisis.
[02:08:56.404 --> 02:09:00.685]  That's why Biden opened it up with Venezuela and Iran to reduce pressure.
[02:09:00.845 --> 02:09:02.866]  It'll trigger what the left wants, a carbon lockdown.
[02:09:04.636 --> 02:09:05.076]  That's right, 100%.
[02:09:05.116 --> 02:09:07.719]  And it's going to blow up energy prices.
[02:09:08.119 --> 02:09:09.301]  Inflation's going to blow up.
[02:09:09.341 --> 02:09:12.964]  This soft landing they try to manage with inflation is not going to happen.
[02:09:13.004 --> 02:09:14.906]  It would be a total economic meltdown.
[02:09:15.346 --> 02:09:16.768]  And so that's the situation.
[02:09:16.828 --> 02:09:20.852]  I think there's a little bit too much overconfidence on the side of the United States.
[02:09:21.212 --> 02:09:22.513]  Israel's not thinking about this.
[02:09:22.533 --> 02:09:23.855]  They're thinking about themselves.
[02:09:23.875 --> 02:09:26.077]  They're thinking about, you know, their strategic interest.
[02:09:26.657 --> 02:09:28.759]  But the United States just needs to say no.
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:42.746]  The United States needs to tell Israel, you know, Biden allegedly in a phone call, according to Axios, called up Israel and said, hey, this was extremely provocative, these two assassinations, and the next time you get in trouble with Iran, we're not going to back you up.
[02:09:43.386 --> 02:09:44.667]  Why didn't they say that this time?
[02:09:44.827 --> 02:09:49.549]  They should tell Israel this time, we're not going to back you up, because it's this moral hazard.
[02:09:49.869 --> 02:09:54.411]  It's this blank check we've given them, which has enabled Netanyahu to be as aggressive
[02:09:55.131 --> 02:10:01.614]  And as expansionist and as provocative as he wants, as suits him, because he knows that we're going to be there.
[02:10:01.914 --> 02:10:02.315]  I want to be clear.
[02:10:02.335 --> 02:10:03.495]  This is not a defense of Netanyahu.
[02:10:03.535 --> 02:10:04.436]  I don't have a dog in that fight.
[02:10:05.096 --> 02:10:07.157]  But it's important to point out he's not even popular in Israel.
[02:10:07.217 --> 02:10:08.318]  He's doing this because he's in trouble.
[02:10:08.918 --> 02:10:13.920]  So this is literally for a politician and his party putting us on the edge of World War III because we forgot one point.
[02:10:14.581 --> 02:10:17.722]  Russia said two months ago they will come to the aid of Iran in a war.
[02:10:18.222 --> 02:10:20.984]  They have a defense pact with them and North Korea and China.
[02:10:21.244 --> 02:10:23.065]  So give us your view on that.
[02:10:24.730 --> 02:10:25.290]  Well, you're right.
[02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:28.011]  And a lot of people put all the blame on Netanyahu.
[02:10:28.051 --> 02:10:34.393]  They don't realize that if Netanyahu were replaced, the next prime minister would probably be even more right-wing than him.
[02:10:34.593 --> 02:10:37.354]  You know, so this is something institutional that's going on in Israel.
[02:10:37.774 --> 02:10:41.595]  And it is true, there is a broader balance of power politics that is going on.
[02:10:41.955 --> 02:10:44.016]  But the United States has to restrain these leaders.
[02:10:44.036 --> 02:10:47.357]  Because I agree with you, if Netanyahu, if he declines to expand the war,
[02:10:48.217 --> 02:10:48.757]  He's toast.
[02:10:49.257 --> 02:10:58.041]  His governing coalition, which is made up of members of the Knesset who are far more right-wing than him, they're going to pull the plug on his coalition and they will get a more willing prime minister.
[02:10:58.121 --> 02:11:00.942]  So, you know, there is something going on in the state of Israel.
[02:11:01.002 --> 02:11:03.283]  The left has been totally evaporated there.
[02:11:03.664 --> 02:11:04.964]  Some people think that's a good thing.
[02:11:05.044 --> 02:11:07.125]  I think it actually makes the region less stable.
[02:11:07.545 --> 02:11:09.466]  And so they're dead set on a conflict.
[02:11:09.866 --> 02:11:13.748]  At the same time, there are a lot of Israelis, like you say, they don't like Netanyahu.
[02:11:14.508 --> 02:11:16.329]  They want the hostages to be brought home.
[02:11:16.409 --> 02:11:18.169]  I think a lot of them are scared as well.
[02:11:18.509 --> 02:11:21.110]  The more right-wing ones, they want to go to war in South Lebanon.
[02:11:21.150 --> 02:11:22.330]  They want to go to war in Iran.
[02:11:22.490 --> 02:11:24.591]  It's going to be catastrophic for everybody involved.
[02:11:24.671 --> 02:11:25.891]  It's going to destroy Lebanon.
[02:11:25.931 --> 02:11:27.012]  It's going to destroy Iran.
[02:11:27.392 --> 02:11:28.472]  Israel will be wiped out.
[02:11:28.872 --> 02:11:32.133]  You know, the irony is I get accused of being the anti-Semite.
[02:11:32.553 --> 02:11:36.174]  Israel gets wiped out if they go to war with Iran and Hezbollah.
[02:11:36.194 --> 02:11:38.475]  150,000 missiles raining down from Hezbollah?
[02:11:38.775 --> 02:11:41.258]  This reminds me of Germany going to war with everybody in World War II.
[02:11:41.998 --> 02:11:46.883]  I mean, if you just sit back and look at it, clearly at the end, Israel's not going to win this.
[02:11:47.504 --> 02:11:50.167]  And I don't understand the desire to go to full war.
[02:11:50.207 --> 02:11:51.048]  It's just insane.
[02:11:52.938 --> 02:11:53.298]  It is.
[02:11:53.778 --> 02:11:55.239]  It is absolutely insane.
[02:11:55.299 --> 02:12:00.822]  And it's this, I do believe that this right wing of Israel, they've gotten a little bit too confident.
[02:12:00.842 --> 02:12:02.182]  They're a little bit too extreme.
[02:12:02.202 --> 02:12:05.424]  I think there are some perverse incentives that have been established.
[02:12:05.744 --> 02:12:07.825]  And I don't think they realize what they're in for.
[02:12:07.865 --> 02:12:11.286]  In 1973, they came to the brink of being destroyed.
[02:12:11.647 --> 02:12:14.408]  And that's when the Prime Minister of Israel threatened the Samson option.
[02:12:14.548 --> 02:12:21.854]  You know, she called up Nixon, Golda Meir, and she said, if we don't get back up from the United States, we're going to nuke the Middle East.
[02:12:22.134 --> 02:12:26.638]  And they've become less and less ambiguous about their nuclear capability, especially in this conflict.
[02:12:26.658 --> 02:12:33.203]  They've basically said outright, it was implicit before, they're saying explicit now, we are going to nuke everybody.
[02:12:33.323 --> 02:12:38.788]  And by the way, the whole world would turn against Israel 10,000 times worse than they have over Gaza.
[02:12:38.808 --> 02:12:40.189]  Like, what kind of thought is that?
[02:12:42.458 --> 02:12:45.882]  It's just this fever that they've got going on there.
[02:12:46.183 --> 02:12:47.785]  They want this war so badly.
[02:12:47.805 --> 02:12:49.747]  They're so aggressive, so expansionist.
[02:12:50.027 --> 02:12:53.732]  And I think there are some people in that regime, they actually think it's a good idea.
[02:12:53.872 --> 02:12:56.195]  And other people have commented on it.
[02:12:56.255 --> 02:12:59.038]  Douglas MacGregor, John Mearsheimer, they've all said,
[02:12:59.759 --> 02:13:09.570]  It's not outside the realm of possibility that Israel deploys a tactical nuclear weapon in Lebanon back against a wall, overwhelmed by conventional military means, by missiles.
[02:13:09.990 --> 02:13:14.035]  Anti-missile system fails, and they deploy the unthinkable.
[02:13:14.135 --> 02:13:15.616]  And maybe it's a very, very small
[02:13:16.477 --> 02:13:16.557]  Yes.
[02:13:46.357 --> 02:13:46.717]  We're good to go.
[02:14:06.588 --> 02:14:09.752]  People can disagree with some of your views, and I do with some of them, but a lot of them I agree with.
[02:14:10.172 --> 02:14:11.854]  I think you're being genuine in what you say.
[02:14:11.894 --> 02:14:13.236]  You believe, and I think a lot of it's true.
[02:14:13.977 --> 02:14:15.178]  How's this play out then?
[02:14:15.378 --> 02:14:15.799]  When do they hit?
[02:14:15.839 --> 02:14:16.159]  Today?
[02:14:16.179 --> 02:14:16.479]  Tomorrow?
[02:14:16.519 --> 02:14:16.960]  Next week?
[02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:18.422]  Does Israel hit first?
[02:14:19.242 --> 02:14:20.844]  I mean, how fast does this go to the races?
[02:14:21.145 --> 02:14:22.126]  And how does Russia respond?
[02:14:23.922 --> 02:14:27.364]  Well, it has been discussed that Israel is considering a preemptive strike.
[02:14:27.624 --> 02:14:29.585]  I don't think that will happen, although it could.
[02:14:29.605 --> 02:14:33.207]  I think that Iran is going to hit today, tomorrow, or Wednesday.
[02:14:33.227 --> 02:14:35.648]  Iranian Foreign Ministry said it will hit before Wednesday.
[02:14:35.988 --> 02:14:36.969]  I think it will be severe.
[02:14:37.109 --> 02:14:38.309]  They're saying it's multi-day.
[02:14:38.670 --> 02:14:40.531]  They're not telegraphing it in advance.
[02:14:40.991 --> 02:14:48.515]  It's dubious if the United States can bring together that defensive coalition from April, which involved all the neighboring countries and France and the United Kingdom.
[02:14:49.215 --> 02:14:50.535]  So I think there will be some damage.
[02:14:50.595 --> 02:14:51.956]  I think there's going to be casualties.
[02:14:52.296 --> 02:14:53.536]  I think there's going to be damage.
[02:14:53.796 --> 02:15:00.178]  You know, even in April, when Iran heavily telegraphed the attack, 10% of the projectiles still got through and they hit their targets.
[02:15:00.498 --> 02:15:07.880]  So if that happens this time over a multi-day period, and then there's some sort of aftershock from Hezbollah, we're talking about serious damage.
[02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:09.461]  Israel can't ignore that.
[02:15:09.601 --> 02:15:11.061]  Israel will then engage Iran.
[02:15:11.421 --> 02:15:12.762]  Israel will engage Hezbollah.
[02:15:13.222 --> 02:15:17.043]  And I think their strike on that port in Yemen was a bit of a warning signal.
[02:15:17.728 --> 02:15:22.315]  Yemen is further away from Israel than Iran, and they struck a major port in Yemen with airstrikes.
[02:15:22.916 --> 02:15:25.179]  They say not with the help of the United States.
[02:15:25.219 --> 02:15:30.707]  The United States claimed they helped, but the suggestion was we can hit targets that far away.
[02:15:30.747 --> 02:15:32.951]  If we can hit that port, we can hit Iran.
[02:15:33.331 --> 02:15:37.372]  So it could potentially be a direct airstrike on Iran.
[02:15:37.732 --> 02:15:40.412]  And if that happens, then it's totally open season.
[02:15:40.492 --> 02:15:45.553]  I think at that point, the United States gets involved and there's a de-escalation, just like there was in April.
[02:15:45.873 --> 02:15:50.734]  But I think if you look, it's sort of like the sinusoidal curve, but the trajectory is clear.
[02:15:50.754 --> 02:15:51.774]  It's pointing upward.
[02:15:52.154 --> 02:15:55.515]  You know, back in April, they were able to choreograph an exchange of fire.
[02:15:55.595 --> 02:15:56.835]  It de-escalated quickly.
[02:15:56.935 --> 02:15:58.856]  Israel didn't reply to Iran's strike.
[02:15:59.296 --> 02:16:00.816]  This time, Israel will hit back.
[02:16:01.616 --> 02:16:03.798]  Iran's gonna be bigger, Israel's gonna hit back.
[02:16:04.179 --> 02:16:09.744]  I don't think this is the be-all end-all, but I think the timing is all converging on this election.
[02:16:09.764 --> 02:16:10.705]  That was my next point.
[02:16:10.725 --> 02:16:12.567]  This is all about the election, so tie it into that.
[02:16:17.392 --> 02:16:22.014]  Right, so with the election, you know, Trump is going to get in, and I like Trump.
[02:16:22.094 --> 02:16:25.416]  I prefer that Trump would win this election, although I've been very critical.
[02:16:25.916 --> 02:16:29.798]  But Trump has been very clear, and it's actually been disturbing to me and sad to see.
[02:16:30.238 --> 02:16:39.082]  Trump put out a message on True Social a week ago, and he said, well, if the reports are true and Iran tries to kill me, they should wipe Iran off the map.
[02:16:39.522 --> 02:16:41.863]  And that's like an invitation for John F. Kennedy.
[02:16:41.923 --> 02:16:48.946]  That's like an invitation for RFK, saying, hey, if I die, then Israel gets everything it always wanted.
[02:16:49.166 --> 02:16:50.747]  Okay, well, guess what's gonna happen next?
[02:16:51.187 --> 02:17:01.392]  So I think it's all building towards this election where either you get Trump and Vance, and they, of course, have the Israel lobby behind them, or you get Kamala, and she's announcing her VP tomorrow.
[02:17:01.692 --> 02:17:04.693]  They say the favorite is Josh Shapiro, who served in the IDF.
[02:17:05.013 --> 02:17:08.795]  He denies it, but I think it's true, and he's obviously pro-Israel Jewish.
[02:17:09.235 --> 02:17:13.379]  So it looks like either way, whether you get Trump or Kamala, and it's going to be a toss-up.
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:15.982]  I think at this point, odds are on for Kamala.
[02:17:16.022 --> 02:17:21.989]  I think with rigging, the polling, the betting markets, I think she's the favorite at this point, sadly.
[02:17:22.429 --> 02:17:28.275]  Trump has lost a lot of the momentum he had, and I think this is when Israel drives the United States into a quagmire.
[02:17:28.996 --> 02:17:31.358]  They take advantage of the chaos and instability.
[02:17:31.378 --> 02:17:32.939]  You know, Biden's out to lunch.
[02:17:32.979 --> 02:17:34.980]  There's no independent will in the White House.
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:36.841]  It's going to be during the transition.
[02:17:37.181 --> 02:17:45.107]  And I think that's when Israel is going to strike because they know there will be no will in the United States, no leadership to restrain them.
[02:17:45.167 --> 02:17:46.788]  There'll be nothing to resist.
[02:17:47.188 --> 02:17:54.198]  And I'll say in defense of Obama, you know, when they wanted the United States to get involved in the Syrian conflict, Obama played along.
[02:17:54.238 --> 02:17:55.320]  He drew the red line.
[02:17:55.720 --> 02:18:00.607]  And then when there was that hoax about chemical weapons, Obama did pull us back from the brink.
[02:18:01.088 --> 02:18:02.470]  You know, Obama pulled us back.
[02:18:03.328 --> 02:18:09.373]  Trump came in and changed the policy in 2017, ended the regime change policy, and we were out of Syria.
[02:18:09.393 --> 02:18:14.477]  We still have a troop presence.
[02:18:14.817 --> 02:18:15.577]  How do we stop this?
[02:18:15.597 --> 02:18:16.898]  Because I agree that's where we're going.
[02:18:16.919 --> 02:18:18.079]  I think it's excellent analysis.
[02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:20.521]  More like driving a car over a cliff.
[02:18:20.561 --> 02:18:21.182]  How do we stop it?
[02:18:23.559 --> 02:18:25.961]  Unfortunately, I don't think there's much that can be done.
[02:18:25.981 --> 02:18:31.105]  I think that there's so much disinformation on social media, I think it's almost impossible.
[02:18:31.145 --> 02:18:33.748]  You know, I've tried to put up the brake lights on this.
[02:18:33.828 --> 02:18:36.450]  I've tried to put up the warning flags since October 7th.
[02:18:36.890 --> 02:18:40.373]  And it's very, I think, pernicious.
[02:18:40.793 --> 02:18:51.742]  On the right wing, they're almost employing a version of the Southern strategy, where when there are anti-war protests, you get all these right-wingers that say, oh, well, those are all Third Worldists.
[02:18:52.483 --> 02:18:54.285]  These guys are like BLM.
[02:18:54.325 --> 02:18:56.587]  These guys are all anti-American.
[02:18:57.087 --> 02:18:59.269]  In a sense, there's a half-truth in there.
[02:18:59.289 --> 02:19:00.971]  The greatest lies have a half-truth.
[02:19:01.631 --> 02:19:05.895]  I'm sure a lot of the BLM people are at these anti-war protests.
[02:19:06.275 --> 02:19:12.360]  At the same time, these anti-war protests probably would retard the involvement of the United States in the conflict.
[02:19:12.681 --> 02:19:15.944]  The boycott against Starbucks and McDonald's is working.
[02:19:16.024 --> 02:19:17.265]  I was skeptical, but it is.
[02:19:18.826 --> 02:19:21.707]  You have an anti-war left that is being attacked by the right.
[02:19:21.807 --> 02:19:30.669]  And then within the right wing, if you try to criticize Trump like Kyle Rittenhouse did, and I'm not a fan of his, but then people pile on and say, well, you have to vote for Trump.
[02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:32.650]  And there's sort of no room for disagreement.
[02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:36.191]  And I'm going out as a very right wing guy, more right wing than you.
[02:19:36.251 --> 02:19:37.851]  It's like you say, we don't even agree on everything.
[02:19:37.871 --> 02:19:38.891]  You're more libertarian.
[02:19:38.991 --> 02:19:39.792]  I'm more right wing.
[02:19:40.232 --> 02:19:42.612]  But I'm out here because I'm not a GOP guy.
[02:19:42.672 --> 02:19:43.693]  I'm an independent.
[02:19:44.093 --> 02:19:48.034]  And I'm saying, where is the anti-war candidate that's going to pull us back from the brink?
[02:19:48.354 --> 02:19:50.555]  And it doesn't seem like there's leverage there.
[02:19:50.675 --> 02:19:52.956]  Well, that's been a big plus about Trump, is he's been anti-war.
[02:19:52.996 --> 02:19:54.697]  And you're right, let's come back with what you just said.
[02:19:55.497 --> 02:19:56.938]  He agrees with Netanyahu.
[02:19:56.958 --> 02:19:58.639]  Netanyahu says, well, they killed Trump, you know.
[02:19:59.199 --> 02:20:04.201]  No, Trump just gave an invitation to the deep state, Israel, whoever, to kill him, to do this.
[02:20:04.482 --> 02:20:10.104]  If I die, vaporize Iran, he just walked into the trap I predicted on July 13th.
[02:20:10.204 --> 02:20:13.426]  I said, they're going to blame Iran to kill Trump, and now he's walking into the trap.
[02:20:13.466 --> 02:20:14.006]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:14.346 --> 02:20:17.909]  Obviously, silver is doing way better than gold in growth, and it's way undervalued.
[02:20:17.929 --> 02:20:18.609]  That's a fact.
[02:20:19.090 --> 02:20:21.231]  Why, then, are the central banks mainly hoarding gold?
[02:20:21.492 --> 02:20:23.333]  Well, because there's simply not enough silver.
[02:20:23.893 --> 02:20:24.094]  Right?
[02:20:24.134 --> 02:20:35.723]  It's like, if you've got central banks that start allocating into silver, when it's $30 an ounce and they want to have it be part of their reserves, it's like, okay, there's not enough silver in the world to do that.
[02:20:36.323 --> 02:20:41.428]  Right, so they have to do gold because it's $2,400 an ounce, not $30 an ounce.
[02:20:41.868 --> 02:20:50.876]  They've got so many quadrillions of fake money, there's too much fiat to even buy the silver.
[02:20:51.397 --> 02:20:54.960]  Which I would say then means silver still will always be the thing that grows the most.
[02:20:56.141 --> 02:21:07.689]  So, silver, historically the numbers prove out that when gold is in a bull market, which it is, we're near all-time highs, silver does better than gold, so silver grows faster.
[02:21:08.089 --> 02:21:09.270]  And there's a reason why.
[02:21:09.731 --> 02:21:11.432]  Silver and gold both act as
[02:21:11.952 --> 02:21:14.793]  Barometers to government distrust, right?
[02:21:15.773 --> 02:21:19.133]  The worse things get, the better financial metals do.
[02:21:19.173 --> 02:21:20.494]  They're a flight for safety.
[02:21:20.914 --> 02:21:25.235]  But what silver has that gold doesn't is it's a manufacturing metal.
[02:21:25.335 --> 02:21:26.435]  It's used in industry.
[02:21:26.515 --> 02:21:32.196]  So in aerospace, in defense, in electronics, in solar power, electric vehicles, all of that.
[02:21:32.656 --> 02:21:37.617]  The demand for silver is through the roof, Alex, and we're just taking advantage of that.
[02:21:38.357 --> 02:21:46.005]  And imagine what silver will do with Trump being president, somebody who actually grows the economy rather than having a stagnant economy.
[02:21:46.425 --> 02:21:50.549]  The industrial need for silver is absolutely going to explode.
[02:21:50.730 --> 02:21:51.210]  No, you're right.
[02:21:51.310 --> 02:21:53.172]  Silver is the closest thing to a silver bullet.
[02:21:53.192 --> 02:21:54.754]  That's why they call it a silver bullet.
[02:21:54.774 --> 02:21:58.317]  People should go to kpm.com forward slash gold right now and get silver now.
[02:21:58.337 --> 02:21:58.778]  We'll be right back.
[02:22:05.771 --> 02:22:13.257]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:22:14.618 --> 02:22:16.360]  So we're really at the end of an age.
[02:22:16.460 --> 02:22:19.362]  A financial age, a political age, a geopolitical age.
[02:22:20.363 --> 02:22:21.063]  A fourth turning.
[02:22:22.164 --> 02:22:26.888]  And we're not up here, myself, Alex Jones, Nick Fuentes, trying to scare you.
[02:22:28.089 --> 02:22:30.171]  What Nick's saying is like dead on.
[02:22:30.211 --> 02:22:31.632]  I totally agree with everything he said.
[02:22:32.112 --> 02:22:32.933]  Exactly what he said.
[02:22:32.973 --> 02:22:33.894]  It's better than I could say it.
[02:22:34.984 --> 02:22:37.947]  And this is real horror we're about to go into.
[02:22:38.508 --> 02:22:41.751]  And they're going to use these wars as the pretext for domestic crackdowns.
[02:22:42.472 --> 02:22:51.021]  They're bringing in the Cashless Society, the video we played last hour of the police arresting people for mild posts on Facebook and how imperious the police are.
[02:22:51.061 --> 02:22:54.345]  I mean, this is really, really, really creepy.
[02:22:55.748 --> 02:22:58.669]  So I get hardened by stuff on Truth Social by Trump.
[02:22:59.369 --> 02:23:00.270]  Voters have a choice.
[02:23:00.310 --> 02:23:04.491]  Trump prosperity or the Kamala crash and Great Depression 2024.
[02:23:05.452 --> 02:23:10.194]  Not to mention the probability of World War III if these very stupid people remain in office.
[02:23:10.254 --> 02:23:12.195]  Remember, Trump was right about everything.
[02:23:13.535 --> 02:23:16.076]  Except you said if you get killed, blow up Iran.
[02:23:17.157 --> 02:23:23.079]  Which, the day you said it, I went on air and I said, you just asked Netanyahu to kill you.
[02:23:24.901 --> 02:23:31.345]  And if you don't think Netanyahu's people will kill Trump in two seconds for power or any other big political corrupt group, you're crazy.
[02:23:31.966 --> 02:23:34.407]  I mean, Netanyahu is a total sociopath.
[02:23:35.588 --> 02:23:36.809]  And he's trying to maintain control.
[02:23:37.650 --> 02:23:40.512]  And our government's run by a bunch of crooks, too.
[02:23:41.432 --> 02:23:46.476]  My issue here is that Trump's gotten smarter than eight years ago.
[02:23:47.694 --> 02:23:50.475]  But still, statements like that, Nick, I want you to elaborate on that.
[02:23:50.535 --> 02:23:53.156]  That is just begging to get killed right there.
[02:23:53.176 --> 02:23:57.038]  That is begging for the deep state to kill you and launch World War III on the back of Trump.
[02:23:57.418 --> 02:24:03.280]  And he may think he's really important and he's invincible because that bullet grazed him, but I just, man, I care about Trump.
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:03.840]  I want him to get in.
[02:24:03.880 --> 02:24:04.820]  I want to turn the country around.
[02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:08.702]  I know he's not perfect, but God Almighty, stuff like that is just asking for it.
[02:24:10.797 --> 02:24:18.379]  I had exactly the same thought when he posted that, and like you said, after the assassination attempt, that was the next thing they said.
[02:24:18.399 --> 02:24:27.662]  I think it was on the 13th, and then by the 15th, the FBI said, we have intelligence that Iran is plotting to assassinate Trump, which is obviously ridiculous.
[02:24:27.702 --> 02:24:31.203]  What happened in Butler, Pennsylvania had nothing to do with Iran.
[02:24:31.223 --> 02:24:32.124]  It's very suspicious.
[02:24:32.924 --> 02:24:33.885]  And there's a lot of questions.
[02:24:33.945 --> 02:24:39.109]  If it goes anywhere, it goes to DHS, it goes to the Biden administration, and the deep state in the United States.
[02:24:39.129 --> 02:24:40.230]  It's got nothing to do with Iran.
[02:24:40.590 --> 02:24:43.452]  And so when he put out that post, I'm thinking, what are you doing?
[02:24:43.813 --> 02:24:50.198]  That intelligent, this fake intelligence that Iran's behind the attack, I'm thinking that's obviously, we know what that's about.
[02:24:50.218 --> 02:24:55.422]  And then for him to go on True Social and say, oh yeah, well if Iran takes a shot, nuke Iran.
[02:24:55.442 --> 02:24:59.265]  By the way, right after Netanyahu tells Congress that.
[02:25:01.181 --> 02:25:03.863]  I mean, I would call this digging your own grave.
[02:25:06.305 --> 02:25:07.446]  That's what it looks like to me.
[02:25:07.847 --> 02:25:11.069]  And this is the history of presidential assassinations.
[02:25:11.089 --> 02:25:18.916]  You know, Jack Kennedy, just a month before he was shot, was telling the Prime Minister of Israel, we're not going to let you build a nuclear arsenal.
[02:25:18.996 --> 02:25:24.140]  And it involved the same thing, which is Israel's geostrategic concerns, which is all based around
[02:25:25.001 --> 02:25:25.742]  Let me just stop you.
[02:25:41.124 --> 02:25:46.206]  This is not a defense of Israel, and I've heard your theories probably before you were born about using that term, which is true.
[02:25:46.627 --> 02:25:48.387]  The old-timers told me Israel killed Kennedy.
[02:25:49.008 --> 02:25:56.031]  And what I learned from people at the table in Dallas the week before they killed him was the oil companies, the banks, the military was mad he was pulling out of Vietnam.
[02:25:56.371 --> 02:26:00.073]  I was told Israel had people there pissed about him not wanting to—Israel had a seat at the table.
[02:26:00.473 --> 02:26:02.314]  And if Israel did it, I would blame it on them all day long.
[02:26:02.814 --> 02:26:15.474]  I'll go with the facts, but I just think the idea that Israel itself did it, I think it was a consortium of groups, but I do think the fact that he was saying no to nukes for Israel was probably maybe a cherry on top or pushing it over the edge.
[02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:17.560]  I agree with you.
[02:26:17.580 --> 02:26:19.001]  A lot of people wanted Kennedy dead.
[02:26:19.041 --> 02:26:26.603]  I mean, there was no shortage of, you know, there's Cold War hots or the mob or, you know, so I totally agree as a consortium, but you don't even have to go to JFK.
[02:26:26.663 --> 02:26:30.185]  I mean, just look at the history of Mossad's assassinations in Iran.
[02:26:30.845 --> 02:26:32.225]  They kill nuclear scientists.
[02:26:32.506 --> 02:26:35.507]  They assassinated leader of Hamas just the other day.
[02:26:35.587 --> 02:26:37.867]  And, you know, it was very interesting about that assassination.
[02:26:37.907 --> 02:26:39.228]  New York Times did a piece on
[02:26:39.568 --> 02:26:44.269]  Well, but it turns out there was a construction project right where the bombs went off for three months before.
[02:27:09.059 --> 02:27:10.240]  In the elevator shaft, right?
[02:27:10.260 --> 02:27:12.641]  In the center of the building, because this is a very solid building.
[02:27:12.661 --> 02:27:18.923]  You know, not to get into it, but point being, these intelligence agencies, you can never apply Occam's razor.
[02:27:18.943 --> 02:27:22.865]  You know, people always say about things, well, the simplest explanations are most likely.
[02:27:23.305 --> 02:27:30.328]  When you understand what these intelligence agencies are capable of and how convoluted, sophisticated their plans are, it's almost the opposite.
[02:27:30.348 --> 02:27:33.690]  You have to assume that the least likely, the most convoluted is right.
[02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:51.573]  And so with the Mossad's history of assassinations and their stated desire, like we talked about earlier, for 20 years to impose regime change in Iran, for Trump to go out and say that after someone took a shot, after Netanyahu's speech in Congress, it is like he's digging his own grave.
[02:27:51.633 --> 02:27:52.914]  It's very strange to me.
[02:27:53.474 --> 02:28:00.115]  And it's like you say, I think in a lot of ways Trump did get smarter, but he's also making a lot of the same errors that he made the first time.
[02:28:00.555 --> 02:28:02.656]  And you're right, Trump was anti-war.
[02:28:02.676 --> 02:28:04.216]  That's one of the things I like about him.
[02:28:04.256 --> 02:28:09.598]  And you know, it's funny, when I talk to liberals, I'm very, I defend Trump.
[02:28:09.639 --> 02:28:12.199]  When I talk to conservatives, I'm a little more critical of Trump.
[02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:17.662]  I talked to Michael Tracy on Glenn Greenwald's show last week, and he's trying to get me to disavow Trump.
[02:28:18.122 --> 02:28:21.703]  And I said, look, when Trump got in in the first term, he kept us out of Syria.
[02:28:22.163 --> 02:28:25.645]  Everyone thought we were going to war in Syria, it was going to be Iraq all over again.
[02:28:25.665 --> 02:28:26.285]  And then North Korea.
[02:28:26.505 --> 02:28:28.746]  He ended regime change in his first three months.
[02:28:29.548 --> 02:28:31.950]  North Korea as well, detente with North Korea.
[02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:35.873]  And, you know, Kim Jong-un says he wants to talk to him again if he gets back in office.
[02:28:36.354 --> 02:28:38.575]  And so there's a whole host of things that he did.
[02:28:38.956 --> 02:28:45.681]  But in his first term, he had people under him that were encouraging him to always do more, go bigger.
[02:28:45.962 --> 02:28:51.806]  They were lying to him about the troop totals, disobeying his orders to draw down the troop totals in Syria and Iraq.
[02:28:51.826 --> 02:28:53.748]  Oh yeah, they told him the troops were out.
[02:28:54.208 --> 02:28:55.129]  They told him the troops were out.
[02:28:55.209 --> 02:28:56.530]  I know you know this, but listeners might not.
[02:28:56.891 --> 02:28:58.452]  They told Trump the troops were out and they weren't out.
[02:29:01.192 --> 02:29:01.412]  Right?
[02:29:01.592 --> 02:29:02.852]  Yeah, they lied for years.
[02:29:03.252 --> 02:29:05.453]  Then he told them, take us out of Syria.
[02:29:05.493 --> 02:29:06.493]  And they said, right away.
[02:29:06.613 --> 02:29:09.214]  And they slow-walked it and didn't take anybody out.
[02:29:09.274 --> 02:29:12.474]  And then he came back in 2019, take everybody out of Syria.
[02:29:12.774 --> 02:29:14.135]  They just abjectly refused.
[02:29:14.535 --> 02:29:15.615]  And then they did it again.
[02:29:15.635 --> 02:29:16.975]  So Nick, let's do this.
[02:29:17.575 --> 02:29:18.756]  Let's do this.
[02:29:18.776 --> 02:29:22.416]  Finish your point, but I want to, when you finish your point, what is your, this will be an important video.
[02:29:22.656 --> 02:29:23.396]  He'll probably see it.
[02:29:24.077 --> 02:29:25.237]  You know, you've had dinner with Trump before.
[02:29:25.717 --> 02:29:27.777]  What is your advice to President Trump?
[02:29:27.797 --> 02:29:30.678]  Finish your point about Syria and then give Trump the advice.
[02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:42.134]  Well, the Syria thing's just an example, but I mean, as far as Trump is concerned in 2024, I think he needs to commit to not going to war in Iran.
[02:29:42.194 --> 02:29:47.476]  And I said at a turning point a few months ago, I've been saying it from the beginning, I'm an uncommitted voter.
[02:29:47.836 --> 02:29:48.996]  I'm very conservative.
[02:29:49.056 --> 02:29:49.436]  I'm white.
[02:29:49.476 --> 02:29:50.077]  I'm Catholic.
[02:29:50.117 --> 02:29:51.217]  I should be a Republican.
[02:29:51.497 --> 02:29:52.898]  I was a Trump supporter for eight years.
[02:29:53.658 --> 02:29:54.819]  I'm uncommitted right now.
[02:29:55.220 --> 02:30:06.252]  But the thing that's going to get me to vote for Trump and turn out, I think it's true of a lot of people and even a lot of people in Michigan who are unlikely Trump voters, we need to be confident that there will be no war in Iran.
[02:30:06.292 --> 02:30:09.475]  So he said in his first term, I started no new wars.
[02:30:09.976 --> 02:30:11.657]  I'd like to hear a strong commitment.
[02:30:12.529 --> 02:30:14.129]  No new wars in the second term.
[02:30:14.529 --> 02:30:21.231]  And I know for some reasons it's not a good idea because you need to have some flexibility conducting a foreign policy.
[02:30:21.271 --> 02:30:25.011]  People need to think you might be able to, but it's too hot right now.
[02:30:25.431 --> 02:30:28.312]  The American people need to know that we're not going to war in Iran.
[02:30:28.352 --> 02:30:36.833]  No matter what the false flag, no matter what happens in the ensuing days, we need to know this is going to be a president that's America first and keeps the troops out of the Middle East.
[02:30:37.213 --> 02:30:38.954]  They should be anywhere other than there right now.
[02:30:40.054 --> 02:30:41.015]  That would be my advice.
[02:30:41.055 --> 02:30:43.976]  And honestly, I think that wins the election.
[02:30:44.457 --> 02:30:49.720]  Because in a lot of ways, the Trump rhetoric is getting further and further away from the America First message of 2016.
[02:30:50.140 --> 02:30:53.342]  I like to say in 2016, he ran as an independent.
[02:30:53.722 --> 02:30:55.283]  Now he's running as a Republican.
[02:30:55.723 --> 02:30:59.765]  And it went from trade, anti-war, and anti-immigration.
[02:31:00.166 --> 02:31:04.628]  Now it's something like cutting taxes, more war, and energy.
[02:31:04.968 --> 02:31:07.710]  And it's not that I necessarily, I think the taxes should be cut.
[02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:09.011]  I think we should unleash energy.
[02:31:09.571 --> 02:31:17.693]  But the reason we invited Trump in and voted for Trump and everything is because he changed the consensus on globalization of trade, borders, and war.
[02:31:18.073 --> 02:31:23.854]  And if he can recommit to those things, then I'm all back on board and I'm bringing all the gripers with me and I think he wins it.
[02:31:23.894 --> 02:31:25.115]  I think he wins the Midwest.
[02:31:25.375 --> 02:31:26.335]  Otherwise, he's in trouble.
[02:31:26.935 --> 02:31:32.076]  Well, again, it's not just a turn off him saying if I get killed, blow up Iran.
[02:31:32.216 --> 02:31:33.837]  It's a very stupid statement.
[02:31:34.856 --> 02:31:44.859]  And that was when I was like, as I was watching you attack Trump, going, oh, Nick's off the reservation, you know, saying he saw the convention, you know, he doesn't like it now.
[02:31:44.899 --> 02:31:45.619]  And I was like, I get it.
[02:31:45.659 --> 02:31:47.840]  It's all pop and trying to get other people on board.
[02:31:48.260 --> 02:31:50.521]  When I saw that, it was like a record skipping sound.
[02:31:50.581 --> 02:31:53.561]  I was like, whoa, Trump still has blind spots, man.
[02:31:53.581 --> 02:31:55.342]  That's like signing your own death warrant right there.
[02:31:55.562 --> 02:31:57.002]  If I get killed, World War III.
[02:31:57.983 --> 02:32:00.083]  You're asking me the detonator for this.
[02:32:00.103 --> 02:32:00.843]  This is insane.
[02:32:00.863 --> 02:32:00.903]  So,
[02:32:02.964 --> 02:32:03.965]  We're good to go.
[02:32:34.404 --> 02:32:38.325]  Well, what's happening in Ukraine, it's turned into a war of attrition.
[02:32:38.685 --> 02:32:41.846]  And this is not good for the United States because we don't make this stuff anymore.
[02:32:41.886 --> 02:32:44.067]  It's turned into a real slog.
[02:32:44.107 --> 02:32:45.107]  You know, it's a stalemate.
[02:32:45.647 --> 02:32:46.467]  Well, it's not really.
[02:32:46.507 --> 02:32:52.969]  The Russians are obviously pushing through very strongly, but it's turned into a war of ammunition and shells and guns and things like that.
[02:32:52.989 --> 02:32:56.230]  But that's always a famous Russian specialty is to suck you in and then wait you out.
[02:32:57.702 --> 02:32:57.982]  Right.
[02:32:58.182 --> 02:32:59.883]  Well, and Russia's a factory.
[02:32:59.903 --> 02:33:01.403]  You know, Russia is a factory.
[02:33:01.443 --> 02:33:02.424]  It's been a factory.
[02:33:02.824 --> 02:33:03.864]  And it's a meat grinder.
[02:33:03.904 --> 02:33:05.065]  They've got the population.
[02:33:05.085 --> 02:33:06.325]  They've got the resources.
[02:33:06.745 --> 02:33:11.967]  And so for the United States to get drawn into this, initially the thought was, well, we're wearing them down.
[02:33:12.648 --> 02:33:14.128]  They make more than we do.
[02:33:14.168 --> 02:33:15.929]  They make 10 times more than we do.
[02:33:16.009 --> 02:33:17.530]  If anyone's getting worn down, it's us.
[02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:18.770]  And here's the problem.
[02:33:19.170 --> 02:33:22.191]  We have commitments to basically every other country.
[02:33:22.231 --> 02:33:23.992]  We've got a commitment now to Taiwan.
[02:33:24.492 --> 02:33:25.993]  Used to be strategic ambiguity.
[02:33:26.733 --> 02:33:32.198]  For 60 years, it was a very careful policy where we would say, you know, well, we might defend Taiwan, we might not.
[02:33:32.498 --> 02:33:36.481]  And that was meant to install a tripwire, but not something so strong.
[02:33:36.521 --> 02:33:39.043]  It was meant to create a little bit of uncertainty in the Chinese.
[02:33:39.424 --> 02:33:42.827]  Now Biden says, if Taiwan is attacked, we're going to war with China.
[02:33:43.207 --> 02:33:45.329]  And we anticipate that'll happen in this decade.
[02:33:45.689 --> 02:33:46.970]  So we're committed to Ukraine.
[02:33:46.990 --> 02:33:48.150]  We're committed to Taiwan.
[02:33:48.431 --> 02:33:51.492]  Increasingly, as we just talked about, we're being drawn into Israel.
[02:33:51.833 --> 02:33:58.497]  And so increasingly it's becoming a politics of the stock shelves of the United States military.
[02:33:58.537 --> 02:34:00.418]  And who's going to get the anti-missile systems?
[02:34:00.438 --> 02:34:01.939]  And who's going to get the missile batteries?
[02:34:02.239 --> 02:34:03.860]  Who's going to get the finite supply?
[02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:05.100]  Look, look, look, look.
[02:34:30.111 --> 02:34:30.491]  We're good.
[02:34:43.655 --> 02:34:43.895]  Right.
[02:34:45.397 --> 02:34:45.817]  I saw it.
[02:34:45.857 --> 02:34:47.819]  You talked about it on your show a couple weeks ago.
[02:34:47.879 --> 02:34:50.782]  It's the ladder by the RAND Corporation that leads to a nuclear war.
[02:34:50.822 --> 02:34:52.023]  We're 20 steps up that.
[02:34:52.283 --> 02:34:53.745]  We're right on the brink right there.
[02:34:54.065 --> 02:34:57.849]  And it's going to start with, we're going to give them longer and longer range missile systems.
[02:34:57.889 --> 02:35:02.533]  We're going to give them, as we have, authorization to strike into the interior of Russia.
[02:35:03.194 --> 02:35:10.940]  And then it's not a long time before American weaponry is killing tons of Russians, and then there's going to be a full-on conflict.
[02:35:11.340 --> 02:35:18.486]  And by the way, you know, if the United States is engaged in Iran, look at these supply planes that have been flying into Tehran for the past week.
[02:35:18.506 --> 02:35:25.531]  They're supplying Iran with anti-air systems, anti-missile systems, radar jamming, and they're also in Syria.
[02:35:25.631 --> 02:35:27.332]  Russians are deployed in Syria.
[02:35:27.692 --> 02:35:30.134]  Turkey is talking about getting involved in Israel.
[02:35:31.155 --> 02:35:40.079]  When this whole thing blows up in the Middle East and Turkey has to go through Syria to get to Israel, they're going to be fighting through the Russians and NATO countries may be backed by the United States.
[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:43.721]  Top Israeli ministers said we'll Saddam Turkey.
[02:35:44.121 --> 02:35:46.282]  Turkey's got 10 times the size of the military.
[02:35:46.742 --> 02:35:51.584]  They've got the biggest standard military in Europe and nuclear weapons.
[02:35:51.624 --> 02:35:54.566]  I mean, Turkey is like the old Constantinople.
[02:35:54.606 --> 02:35:55.846]  You don't want to go to war with the Turks.
[02:35:56.046 --> 02:35:57.807]  That's a whole other thing.
[02:35:57.847 --> 02:35:59.008]  They're probably worse than Iran.
[02:36:00.868 --> 02:36:02.349]  Well, they can't even beat Hamas.
[02:36:02.369 --> 02:36:06.892]  They're struggling to beat Hamas, and now they want to fight Iran, Hezbollah, and Turkey all at the same time.
[02:36:07.372 --> 02:36:08.272]  It's not going to happen.
[02:36:08.833 --> 02:36:12.735]  And Turkey's a NATO country, so it's just a total disaster waiting to happen.
[02:36:12.915 --> 02:36:20.980]  And I think everybody recognizes, and you know because you're a history guy also, this is the same kind of alliance building
[02:36:21.340 --> 02:36:24.562]  And the tripwire that started World War I and World War II.
[02:36:24.902 --> 02:36:29.285]  It's all these commitments, America's overextended... I was about to say, this looks like World War I and World War II.
[02:36:29.666 --> 02:36:30.446]  Everybody's lining up.
[02:36:30.486 --> 02:36:31.207]  So how do we stop it?
[02:36:31.227 --> 02:36:32.147]  Because I got four children.
[02:36:32.167 --> 02:36:35.129]  I'm not one of these guys that wants to be in a war and thinks it's cool.
[02:36:35.309 --> 02:36:35.970]  I know you're not either.
[02:36:36.310 --> 02:36:37.391]  How do we stop this madness?
[02:36:38.931 --> 02:36:39.251]  I agree.
[02:36:39.291 --> 02:36:39.992]  It's not cool.
[02:36:40.052 --> 02:36:41.072]  And you know, I'm a young guy.
[02:36:41.132 --> 02:36:41.953]  I would get drafted.
[02:36:42.173 --> 02:36:46.295]  I'm going to have to go and fight or be locked up in a concentration camp or something here in America.
[02:36:46.356 --> 02:36:50.538]  But I think that we have to push for a policy of restraint.
[02:36:50.678 --> 02:36:54.000]  We need, because look, Trump is our best chance.
[02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:56.562]  I still believe that, even though I'm very skeptical.
[02:36:57.282 --> 02:37:00.203]  If Kamala gets in, it's going to be all-out war.
[02:37:00.684 --> 02:37:07.407]  Trump is still our last best chance, but it's really now, just like it was in 2017, a battle for the Trump administration.
[02:37:07.747 --> 02:37:09.048]  And I hate that it's this way.
[02:37:09.408 --> 02:37:10.448]  It shouldn't be this way.
[02:37:11.169 --> 02:37:20.813]  But once again, it's going to be the real Trump loyalists and the real America firsters that are going to have to fight inside the Trump administration and wrest control back from the neocons.
[02:37:21.253 --> 02:37:26.116]  And so I think that the path to global peace, it's a policy of American restraint.
[02:37:26.756 --> 02:37:35.403]  I think the only one that can even do it is Trump, but the only way to get Trump to do it is to fight a battle within his team and within his future administration.
[02:37:35.784 --> 02:37:43.150]  He's got to win the election, but then when he wins the election, during the transition, we need to get people in that are going to stop the war.
[02:37:43.490 --> 02:37:46.372]  If it's Rick Grenell and Nikki Haley, it's not going to happen.
[02:37:46.573 --> 02:37:47.173]  No, I agree.
[02:37:48.814 --> 02:37:49.635]  What do you think of J.D.
[02:37:49.655 --> 02:37:51.457]  Vance, at least on the surface he's anti-war?
[02:37:54.207 --> 02:37:55.808]  I'm very skeptical of J.D.
[02:37:55.848 --> 02:37:57.650]  Vance only because of his connections.
[02:37:57.730 --> 02:38:00.672]  And, you know, I talked about this on your show before he was chosen.
[02:38:00.712 --> 02:38:02.213]  He was my pick to be V.P.
[02:38:02.233 --> 02:38:04.054]  because I had heard rumblings about this.
[02:38:04.895 --> 02:38:08.037]  And it's like you say, he says he's anti-war, but not really.
[02:38:08.097 --> 02:38:10.920]  I mean, if you listen to his statements, he's saying something very specific.
[02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:13.241]  He said Ukraine is different than Israel.
[02:38:13.582 --> 02:38:17.104]  He said, I don't care what happens to Ukraine, but Israel we should still support.
[02:38:17.464 --> 02:38:19.026]  And he went to the Quincy Institute.
[02:38:19.066 --> 02:38:20.747]  Quincy Institute is a new think tank.
[02:38:21.107 --> 02:38:23.368]  They push American restraint, they're anti-war.
[02:38:23.568 --> 02:38:24.429]  These are good guys.
[02:38:24.969 --> 02:38:30.092]  He went to this anti-war think tank and gave a speech about how we need to support Israel unconditionally.
[02:38:30.752 --> 02:38:31.773]  And this was back in June.
[02:38:31.833 --> 02:38:36.295]  This was in the middle, in the thick of, this was after Iran's strike on Israel.
[02:38:36.635 --> 02:38:44.399]  So for him to say that, I know he was vying for the VP slot and he got to appease the donor class, of which there are many pro-Israel types on the GOP side.
[02:38:44.839 --> 02:38:46.720]  But when I heard that, it's a very bad omen.
[02:38:47.060 --> 02:38:49.542]  And then he considers connections to Silicon Valley.
[02:38:50.282 --> 02:38:52.443]  Silicon Valley is deeply entrenched in Israel.
[02:38:52.523 --> 02:38:58.126]  His benefactor, Peter Thiel, gave $15 million to his PAC to win the Senate seat in 2022.
[02:38:58.786 --> 02:39:01.467]  Half of Peter Thiel's net worth is bound up in Palantir.
[02:39:01.487 --> 02:39:03.968]  Palantir is a CIA contractor.
[02:39:03.988 --> 02:39:05.029]  That's how they started out.
[02:39:05.089 --> 02:39:07.070]  They did exclusive contracts with the CIA.
[02:39:08.050 --> 02:39:08.670]  It's a surveillance.
[02:39:08.690 --> 02:39:08.850]  Right.
[02:39:08.990 --> 02:39:12.172]  And they're involved in Israel doing the Lavender Program right now.
[02:39:12.512 --> 02:39:14.393]  But see, that's my issue.
[02:39:14.473 --> 02:39:15.253]  I think the U.S.
[02:39:15.293 --> 02:39:17.414]  government is super corrupt and out of control.
[02:39:17.574 --> 02:39:18.515]  I don't blame the American people.
[02:39:18.955 --> 02:39:20.435]  The Israeli government is super corrupt.
[02:39:20.456 --> 02:39:21.716]  The British government, horrible.
[02:39:22.116 --> 02:39:24.477]  The German government, I mean, the Chinese government.
[02:39:24.497 --> 02:39:29.519]  But at the end of the day, I just don't, I know Israel has incredible powers involved in our business and I'm a big critic.
[02:39:30.020 --> 02:39:32.641]  I just don't like make all policy point towards Baghdad.
[02:39:32.661 --> 02:39:34.402]  I mean, you really think Israel is...
[02:39:35.582 --> 02:39:40.685]  Out of a pie of 100% influence over the U.S., how much does Israel have influence?
[02:39:41.025 --> 02:39:41.945]  Like, what's your view?
[02:39:41.965 --> 02:39:43.866]  Because I don't know, but, I mean, like 30%?
[02:39:44.247 --> 02:39:45.407]  You're saying more?
[02:39:45.427 --> 02:39:47.788]  I'd say it's very high.
[02:39:48.029 --> 02:39:55.632]  And I would have said less before October 7th, but you've really seen them exert their influence over the universities, over Congress.
[02:39:55.973 --> 02:40:00.695]  You know, it's like, people always say I make everything about Israel, and you know, that's a fair criticism.
[02:40:01.455 --> 02:40:03.737]  But after the April attack against Israel,
[02:40:04.637 --> 02:40:08.578]  Republicans shut down Congress from October 1st until April 13th.
[02:40:08.618 --> 02:40:14.220]  They said, we're not going to give money for Ukraine until the Democrats agree to cut spending and do border security.
[02:40:14.740 --> 02:40:18.721]  But when Israel got attacked on April 13th, they split up the bills.
[02:40:18.762 --> 02:40:20.582]  They passed all the appropriations.
[02:40:20.982 --> 02:40:22.163]  Ukraine got their 60.
[02:40:22.503 --> 02:40:23.903]  Israel got their 28 billion.
[02:40:23.943 --> 02:40:25.324]  Taiwan got their 7 billion.
[02:40:25.384 --> 02:40:26.164]  It happened like that.
[02:40:27.372 --> 02:40:27.592]  And it's
[02:40:44.281 --> 02:40:47.906]  You know, a lot of my people say, well, you never criticize Israel, but you do.
[02:40:48.026 --> 02:40:51.390]  And maybe your people say, well, I don't criticize China, but I do too.
[02:40:51.951 --> 02:40:52.431]  So you're right.
[02:40:52.451 --> 02:40:56.897]  It's a complicated world, and there are different intelligence agencies and different interests at work.
[02:40:56.917 --> 02:41:00.121]  And Israel is the biggest seller of our secrets in China, and I've always pointed that out.
[02:41:01.756 --> 02:41:07.901]  Absolutely, yeah, and you've talked about the liberty and everything, you know, so nobody can accuse you of not, you know, not being forthright on those things.
[02:41:08.601 --> 02:41:10.843]  But the big concern for me is this thing with Iran.
[02:41:10.903 --> 02:41:15.146]  I think the Iran conflict, that's where it's being pushed the most with Netanyahu right now.
[02:41:15.546 --> 02:41:16.547]  This is a wild man.
[02:41:16.787 --> 02:41:18.729]  It's like you said, they're threatening to blow up Turkey.
[02:41:19.309 --> 02:41:22.392]  These people, they talk about the Iranians being irrational.
[02:41:22.412 --> 02:41:25.094]  They talk about the mullahs in Iran wanting an apocalypse.
[02:41:25.794 --> 02:41:30.297]  Well, if you're talking about going to war against Turkey and Iran at the same time, it sounds like you want the apocalypse.
[02:41:30.317 --> 02:41:31.518]  Well, you do gotta give it to Israel.
[02:41:31.598 --> 02:41:35.801]  I mean, they are very competent at assassination and sabotage and all this stuff.
[02:41:35.841 --> 02:41:36.981]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:41:37.562 --> 02:41:42.865]  And my view is, let's not blow the world up, because I can see Israel getting destroyed in this.
[02:41:42.965 --> 02:41:45.707]  I don't have some heart on it, and I don't want to destroy Israel.
[02:41:45.867 --> 02:41:51.731]  But at the same time, I see my family and my life, and I don't care who they are, neocons, liberals, conservatives, they want World War III.
[02:41:51.791 --> 02:41:52.291]  I don't like it.
[02:41:52.832 --> 02:41:53.412]  I'm tired of it.
[02:41:54.861 --> 02:41:55.301]  Me neither.
[02:41:55.321 --> 02:41:57.522]  Yeah, it's going to be over for America.
[02:41:57.582 --> 02:42:02.943]  I mean, we totally forfeited all of this treasure that we had after the end of the Soviet Union.
[02:42:03.223 --> 02:42:07.664]  Like, we dominated the world after 1991, after the USSR collapsed.
[02:42:07.985 --> 02:42:13.546]  We squandered all of it with this financialization in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:42:14.106 --> 02:42:17.207]  And we really, I do believe we have a chance to turn things around.
[02:42:17.587 --> 02:42:19.128]  People are always asking, is it too late?
[02:42:19.188 --> 02:42:20.108]  Are we too far gone?
[02:42:21.028 --> 02:42:23.370]  It might be, you know, but there's always wiggle room.
[02:42:23.410 --> 02:42:31.976]  I think that there is a chance that we could turn things around, but if we're involved in another 10 years in the Middle East, it's going to be really over for this country.
[02:42:32.016 --> 02:42:36.199]  We're way too overextended and we will meet the same fate of other empires.
[02:42:36.299 --> 02:42:37.640]  Well, I agree with you and speak to this.
[02:42:38.100 --> 02:42:40.722]  The world loved America 50 years ago.
[02:42:40.782 --> 02:42:41.883]  It still liked us 20 years ago.
[02:42:41.923 --> 02:42:42.904]  The world hates us now.
[02:42:43.624 --> 02:42:48.090]  And a big part of it is the Middle East stuff and the exporting of all the pervert stuff.
[02:42:48.711 --> 02:42:53.918]  It looks like the elites running things are doing stuff deliberately to undermine America.
[02:42:53.939 --> 02:42:55.200]  There's a real schizophrenia there.
[02:42:55.561 --> 02:42:56.162]  Can you speak to that?
[02:42:57.850 --> 02:42:58.451]  I agree with you.
[02:42:58.491 --> 02:42:58.871]  It's true.
[02:42:58.911 --> 02:43:01.993]  70 years ago, the Muslim world didn't have a problem with the United States.
[02:43:02.014 --> 02:43:03.235]  A lot of people don't realize that.
[02:43:03.795 --> 02:43:09.560]  The Islamic world didn't like Europe because of the Crusades and the historic conflict there between Christians and Muslims.
[02:43:10.521 --> 02:43:14.504]  But in the 20th century, the first half of the 20th century, the Muslim world actually liked
[02:43:14.744 --> 02:43:15.205]  America.
[02:43:15.245 --> 02:43:16.766]  They're optimistic about America.
[02:43:17.047 --> 02:43:18.468]  And so was the rest of the world.
[02:43:18.508 --> 02:43:19.229]  But now you're right.
[02:43:19.770 --> 02:43:24.275]  Every other country is now chomping at the bit to get involved with China and get involved with BRICS.
[02:43:24.615 --> 02:43:27.058]  In Africa, they're waving the Russian flag.
[02:43:27.098 --> 02:43:29.381]  In Nigeria, it doesn't even make sense.
[02:43:29.421 --> 02:43:30.662]  It doesn't look like it makes sense.
[02:43:32.344 --> 02:43:34.205]  The United States is really in a bad place.
[02:43:34.865 --> 02:43:35.726]  And I think you're right.
[02:43:35.766 --> 02:43:38.387]  I think they are trying to undermine American power.
[02:43:39.768 --> 02:43:43.570]  And the thing is, it's just really a question of who the American power benefits.
[02:43:43.610 --> 02:43:51.114]  I think that the United States has been used as an instrument by a global, ultra-wealthy class for a very long time.
[02:43:51.534 --> 02:43:58.818]  And as such, they have let the reputation and the wealth and everything else, the sort of interior of the country, get depleted
[02:43:59.478 --> 02:44:03.063]  We've been a battering ram for whatever special interests can get us.
[02:44:16.970 --> 02:44:19.172]  That's exactly, that's a perfect way to say it.
[02:44:19.292 --> 02:44:21.734]  And our reputation has been the casualty.
[02:44:21.774 --> 02:44:24.096]  It's been collateral damage in their war.
[02:44:24.456 --> 02:44:29.500]  Because what's interesting is when Trump came to power, the world leaders actually kind of liked him.
[02:44:29.881 --> 02:44:34.965]  Like Kim Jong Un, who has every reason to be suspicious of and hate the United States.
[02:44:35.265 --> 02:44:38.128]  He actually thought Trump was kind of cool and they were like hanging out.
[02:44:38.168 --> 02:44:52.824]  I know people are skeptical of that, but it spoke to something Trump represented to the world, a breakthrough where now that you're getting the American people instead of this blob, instead of this foreign policy, ultra rich blob, Putin talked about that.
[02:44:53.165 --> 02:44:54.646]  Kim Jong-un recognized that.
[02:44:55.327 --> 02:45:00.211]  I think a lot of people recognize that, and now we've just been submerged back under the blob.
[02:45:00.271 --> 02:45:05.735]  So that's really the tension in the United States, because I think everybody recognizes the people are good.
[02:45:06.015 --> 02:45:13.361]  Even Maduro, Nicolas Maduro, another one who's been totally hated by the United States, he says, hey, the Americans aren't bad.
[02:45:13.861 --> 02:45:18.985]  It's these global special interests that are going and bringing the United States to war against us.
[02:45:19.465 --> 02:45:21.847]  And so that's really the adversary.
[02:45:21.927 --> 02:45:23.909]  And that way, I'm totally in agreement with you.
[02:45:24.309 --> 02:45:26.811]  I think most people are fundamentally good in the world.
[02:45:27.992 --> 02:45:29.272]  They're well-meaning, I should say.
[02:45:29.312 --> 02:45:31.994]  Maybe, you know, people are fallen, but I think people are well-meaning.
[02:45:32.355 --> 02:45:38.419]  But it is these global elites who are more powerful than ever in tech, in finance, and so on.
[02:45:38.879 --> 02:45:44.383]  And I think they're bringing the world to a very sad, impoverished, dangerous place.
[02:45:44.623 --> 02:45:46.804]  And it has very little to do with the people of the world.
[02:45:47.285 --> 02:45:50.347]  Well, Nick, we'll do five more minutes the next hour and let you go.
[02:45:50.367 --> 02:45:51.528]  And we've got Gerald Celente coming up.
[02:45:51.548 --> 02:45:53.069]  We'll do five more minutes because I want to ask you.
[02:45:53.949 --> 02:46:03.949]  In closing about all the other little tidbits and things that you've got cooking and what you think is most important, but how do people find your show to actually hear what you actually say versus what the media says you say?
[02:46:04.650 --> 02:46:05.212]  How do they find it?
[02:46:07.372 --> 02:46:10.513]  I'm on Rumble, and my username is NickJFuentes.
[02:46:10.593 --> 02:46:14.695]  I'm on the air Monday through Friday, 8 o'clock Central, and I'm on Twitter, NickJFuentes.
[02:46:15.595 --> 02:46:17.496]  But yeah, yeah, we'll do another five minutes, sounds good.
[02:46:17.536 --> 02:46:19.937]  We'll talk about, we'll cook, we'll keep cooking.
[02:46:20.337 --> 02:46:25.359]  Absolutely, and come back soon, we'll take calls, because it's good to have the forbidden people on the show.
[02:46:25.759 --> 02:46:28.000]  And by the way, there's been a new statement by Jamie Raskin.
[02:46:28.560 --> 02:46:30.201]  We're going to come back and play that, stay with us.
[02:46:30.921 --> 02:46:32.682]  This broadcast is Lister-supported.
[02:46:32.702 --> 02:46:35.643]  We try to bring you things that enrich your life.
[02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:39.061]  So that you get a great response from it, you want to get it again.
[02:46:39.381 --> 02:46:45.845]  And we have a great line of amazing, high-quality products at InfoWarsStore.com called the InfoWars MD line.
[02:46:47.386 --> 02:46:59.432]  And we just discovered two years ago that one of the main suppliers of the companies we were using, that are also big companies, of the raw materials for things like bodies filled with turmeric formula, was this company.
[02:46:59.452 --> 02:47:02.714]  And they said, hey, keep selling your products, that's great, but you get your product from us anyways.
[02:47:03.925 --> 02:47:05.927]  We can private label at our factory for you.
[02:47:06.027 --> 02:47:07.108]  Put your label on our stuff.
[02:47:07.128 --> 02:47:08.068]  Give people a discount.
[02:47:09.009 --> 02:47:14.033]  And that way, if you have supplies to chain issues, which we were having, we have got it for you.
[02:47:15.455 --> 02:47:17.917]  Well, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[02:47:17.937 --> 02:47:21.340]  The probiotic formula, the prebiotic formula, the good night's sleep.
[02:47:22.352 --> 02:47:26.334]  The Nerve Renew, the Joint Relief Max is an amazing natural pain reliever.
[02:47:26.434 --> 02:47:30.615]  The Ashwagandha and Black Pepper, the Ashwagandha Gummies, Prostate Support.
[02:47:31.396 --> 02:47:41.940]  And of course, the Turmeric 95 is 95% normal turmeric, 4% to 5%, works great for your whole body's inflammation, for your heart, your lungs, your joints, your bones.
[02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:44.621]  Remember I told you, I said, we have the strongest turmeric in the country.
[02:47:45.481 --> 02:47:46.502]  The last five years, we did.
[02:47:46.522 --> 02:47:48.123]  And it was these guys that made it.
[02:47:48.183 --> 02:47:51.004]  They decided to make their own, watching us demand even a higher
[02:47:51.937 --> 02:47:54.121]  We're good to go.
[02:47:54.201 --> 02:47:54.722]  We're good to go.
[02:48:05.540 --> 02:48:06.661]  But it's all apples and oranges.
[02:48:06.721 --> 02:48:07.422]  It works great.
[02:48:07.762 --> 02:48:13.288]  Tumeric95, InfowarsMD, InfowarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:48:13.588 --> 02:48:17.453]  We're selling out of the X2, the X3.
[02:48:18.113 --> 02:48:20.195]  And if we get shut down, that'll never be available again.
[02:48:20.215 --> 02:48:21.577]  But everything we have is in stock.
[02:48:22.057 --> 02:48:24.160]  And I'll have updates on the future of Infowars soon.
[02:48:24.440 --> 02:48:28.004]  We've got a minimum of two months, maybe four or five months.
[02:48:29.540 --> 02:48:34.063]  And I've learned some major developments on that front that I'm not at liberty to talk about yet, but I will soon.
[02:48:34.143 --> 02:48:34.843]  Big breaking news.
[02:48:34.883 --> 02:48:38.065]  The deep state's out in the open, wanting this place shut down.
[02:48:38.105 --> 02:48:39.505]  You already saw that in the last seven weeks.
[02:48:39.866 --> 02:48:41.647]  But we've got new intel that's incredible.
[02:48:42.447 --> 02:48:44.468]  And then separately, this is not our t-shirt.
[02:48:45.008 --> 02:48:45.789]  Our t-shirt's great.
[02:48:45.969 --> 02:48:46.429]  And it's here.
[02:48:46.469 --> 02:48:47.050]  It's now shipping.
[02:48:47.910 --> 02:48:52.573]  But if you want to get the Hold the Line Never Surrender shirt, it's holdtheline.com.
[02:48:52.913 --> 02:48:58.016]  They're one of the top Trump Patriot apparel producers in the country, and they have got on-demand printing.
[02:48:58.516 --> 02:49:00.297]  So when you order, it ships right out.
[02:49:00.477 --> 02:49:01.878]  They got factories in Arkansas.
[02:49:02.758 --> 02:49:08.781]  So if you want the new Hold the Line shirt, it says Never Surrender on the front.
[02:49:09.562 --> 02:49:10.342]  It's a color shirt.
[02:49:10.362 --> 02:49:11.123]  It's a beautiful shirt.
[02:49:12.062 --> 02:49:15.065]  And on the back, it says the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:49:15.365 --> 02:49:17.347]  And my signature, it is a limited edition shirt.
[02:49:18.028 --> 02:49:19.169]  HoldTheLine.com.
[02:49:19.869 --> 02:49:20.750]  I cut a promo on it.
[02:49:20.770 --> 02:49:21.311]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:49:21.931 --> 02:49:26.796]  Wear it proudly in public, and you'll probably get what I've experienced, 95% love.
[02:49:27.116 --> 02:49:32.461]  You may have some leftists try to physically attack you as well, but it's an adventure to wear this shirt.
[02:49:32.481 --> 02:49:34.643]  I've been wearing it out in public, and it's been amazing.
[02:49:35.163 --> 02:49:36.585]  By wearing this shirt in public,
[02:49:56.303 --> 02:50:04.645]  You raise your fists of defiance with President Trump and myself and many others for the globalist tyranny and say, we will never surrender the New World Order.
[02:50:05.085 --> 02:50:07.685]  And the answer to your tyranny is 1776.
[02:50:08.785 --> 02:50:09.886]  We will never surrender.
[02:50:10.066 --> 02:50:11.706]  We will fight, fight, fight!
[02:50:12.006 --> 02:50:12.886]  Because the answer to 1984 is 1776!
[02:50:12.926 --> 02:50:13.086]  Fight!
[02:50:13.106 --> 02:50:13.246]  Fight!
[02:50:13.266 --> 02:50:13.386]  Fight!
[02:50:30.823 --> 02:50:34.887]  Alright, final segment with Nick Fuentes, and then Gerald Celente takes over.
[02:50:34.907 --> 02:50:40.391]  We've got a little bit of news I'm going to cover after he leaves us, but we were talking during the break about why do they hate Trump so much?
[02:50:41.072 --> 02:50:44.375]  Because as much as I get irritated by Trump, the other side is ten times worse.
[02:50:44.715 --> 02:50:53.423]  And look, I'm not perfect either, but Jamie Raskin says Congress will stop Trump on J6 using the 14th Amendment and create civil war conditions.
[02:50:54.003 --> 02:50:59.028]  If he's re-elected, these Uniparty snakes are the greatest threat to our country that has ever existed, D.C.
[02:50:59.048 --> 02:51:01.330]  Drano says, and they won't give up power without a fight.
[02:51:01.370 --> 02:51:01.810]  Here he is.
[02:51:03.232 --> 02:51:18.186]  What can be put into the Constitution can slip away from you very quickly, and the greatest example going on right now before our very eyes is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which they're just disappearing with a magic wand, as if it doesn't exist, even though it could not be clearer
[02:51:18.866 --> 02:51:19.807]  We're good to go.
[02:51:49.625 --> 02:51:58.752]  He just said this on C-SPAN yesterday.
[02:51:58.913 --> 02:52:00.354]  I just learned about this 20 minutes ago.
[02:52:00.954 --> 02:52:02.295]  I could have done the whole show on this.
[02:52:03.016 --> 02:52:07.960]  They're telling you they're going to create civil war conditions and not let him be seated as the president.
[02:52:08.040 --> 02:52:11.783]  Everything they accused him of, they're now doing, showing their total desperation.
[02:52:11.823 --> 02:52:13.425]  This guy's father was a famous communist.
[02:52:15.446 --> 02:52:17.167]  He is admitting their plan.
[02:52:17.227 --> 02:52:19.308]  This is treason, Nick, out in the open.
[02:52:19.328 --> 02:52:20.008]  What do you say to this?
[02:52:21.749 --> 02:52:22.430]  It is treason.
[02:52:22.490 --> 02:52:24.991]  It's a totally reckless and dangerous thing to say.
[02:52:25.031 --> 02:52:29.934]  And if there's any hint of truth to this, this is like a national, it's a grave national security concern.
[02:52:30.495 --> 02:52:34.957]  And I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that it could lead to a constitutional crisis.
[02:52:35.597 --> 02:52:41.021]  And a lot of people were wondering what happens if Trump wins, given what happened with January 6th and everything.
[02:52:41.881 --> 02:52:49.226]  Democrats trying to lock him up and the Democrats trying to really get him on insurrection, although I don't think they could make those charges stick.
[02:52:49.546 --> 02:52:51.648]  And so the question is, well, what happens if he wins?
[02:52:51.688 --> 02:52:52.989]  Does he become the president?
[02:52:53.009 --> 02:53:00.874]  I don't think it's crazy to say that the Democrats would try something like this, where they try to create a constitutional crisis.
[02:53:01.434 --> 02:53:03.636]  And in the event that that happened, it's a color revolution.
[02:53:03.676 --> 02:53:09.740]  I mean, it's a full on, you know, obviously the Stop the Steal campaign January 6th was not a coup attempt.
[02:53:09.880 --> 02:53:11.481]  We wanted to audit the election.
[02:53:12.241 --> 02:53:15.323]  Yeah, he just said civil war conditions.
[02:53:15.383 --> 02:53:16.843]  He said, we're going to war with you.
[02:53:18.524 --> 02:53:21.085]  Right, which is vastly different than what happened then.
[02:53:21.125 --> 02:53:29.169]  They're basically saying, we're going to bring the fight to the people, we're going to swap out the president, and then we're going to suppress and quell anybody that has a problem with it.
[02:53:29.229 --> 02:53:31.730]  So I think it's a very dangerous thing to say.
[02:53:31.870 --> 02:53:35.972]  And, you know, these people, I think it's the same reason why they wanted to kill Trump.
[02:53:36.032 --> 02:53:38.253]  I think that Trump represents to them
[02:53:39.033 --> 02:53:40.274]  And this is a declaration of war, Nick.
[02:53:40.554 --> 02:53:41.315]  This is a declaration of war.
[02:53:57.017 --> 02:53:57.517]  It is, yeah.
[02:53:57.557 --> 02:53:59.839]  This is this cold war going hot.
[02:54:00.319 --> 02:54:04.261]  It's been a cold war, and it's like we said, you know, they've tried everything against Trump.
[02:54:04.601 --> 02:54:11.965]  Lawfare investigation, slander, they took a shot, and then ultimately it's going to be, well, we're just outright doing a civil war.
[02:54:12.205 --> 02:54:13.045]  You know, that's the last stage.
[02:54:13.065 --> 02:54:17.047]  Yeah, he just said we're planning a civil war if he gets re-elected.
[02:54:18.368 --> 02:54:20.990]  If you or I said this, which we wouldn't, we'd be arrested.
[02:54:21.050 --> 02:54:23.531]  He's literally, and he's in government, he means it.
[02:54:25.168 --> 02:54:25.368]  Yeah.
[02:54:25.788 --> 02:54:27.669]  Could you imagine if Matt Gaetz said that?
[02:54:27.709 --> 02:54:35.132]  Could you imagine if you or I or even Trump, God forbid, I think the head of the Heritage Foundation said, oh, there's going to be a revolution.
[02:54:35.512 --> 02:54:37.253]  And they nearly drove him out of town.
[02:54:37.313 --> 02:54:39.514]  A sitting congressman says we're going to do a civil war.
[02:54:39.974 --> 02:54:40.594]  Nobody cares.
[02:54:41.094 --> 02:54:44.015]  You know, but that's the double standard that they have with law enforcement.
[02:54:45.076 --> 02:54:46.156]  But, you know, I don't know.
[02:54:46.176 --> 02:54:48.717]  I mean, the 14th Amendment, I don't think that would hold them back.
[02:54:48.897 --> 02:54:50.018]  I don't think the Democrats
[02:54:50.518 --> 02:54:52.661]  I don't think that would stop the Democrats from trying, though.
[02:54:52.862 --> 02:54:55.105]  Oh, the point is they think they're going to steal opposition.
[02:54:55.125 --> 02:54:57.608]  Yeah, they're saying they're going to try to steal Congress this election.
[02:54:58.009 --> 02:55:00.012]  And then, well, Nick, thank you so much.
[02:55:00.052 --> 02:55:03.377]  People should follow you on X. Nick J. Fuentes, thank you so much.
[02:55:03.417 --> 02:55:03.958]  Amazing interview.
[02:55:05.697 --> 02:55:06.377]  Thanks for having me.
[02:55:06.417 --> 02:55:06.978]  Good to be with you.
[02:55:06.998 --> 02:55:08.118]  Let me say bye to you during the break.
[02:55:08.438 --> 02:55:10.399]  I'm going to come back with some closing comments, folks.
[02:55:10.919 --> 02:55:12.200]  I'm going to play this again when we come back.
[02:55:12.260 --> 02:55:14.281]  This is, this is horrible.
[02:55:14.701 --> 02:55:16.562]  I mean, this is really bad.
[02:55:16.922 --> 02:55:19.263]  This is an open declaration of civil war.
[02:55:19.843 --> 02:55:22.244]  These people are, they're, they're our enemies.
[02:55:22.764 --> 02:55:23.084]  All right.
[02:55:23.104 --> 02:55:29.887]  The great Gerald Celente is set to take over just here in a few minutes, but this clip that I'm going to do videos on will be on Infowars.com.
[02:55:29.907 --> 02:55:31.108]  I haven't put it out on X yet.
[02:55:32.415 --> 02:55:52.500]  That they brought me, and I checked, this is just a day or so ago, a high-level Democrat operative, his father, a famous communist operative of the Soviet Union, Representative Jamie Raskin, says Congress will stop Donald Trump on J-6 using the 14th Amendment and create civil war conditions once President Trump is elected.
[02:55:55.560 --> 02:55:57.121]  Civil war conditions.
[02:55:57.401 --> 02:55:58.301]  They already tried to kill him.
[02:55:59.605 --> 02:56:01.026]  Now they're trying to start a war with Iran.
[02:56:01.066 --> 02:56:03.287]  This is crazy town stuff.
[02:56:03.807 --> 02:56:07.068]  Everything they accused Trump of, they're publicly doing.
[02:56:08.949 --> 02:56:10.430]  And they mean business.
[02:56:11.190 --> 02:56:11.710]  Here's the clip.
[02:56:12.811 --> 02:56:16.472]  What can be put into the Constitution can slip away from you very quickly.
[02:56:16.852 --> 02:56:27.757]  And the greatest example going on right now before our very eyes is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which they're just disappearing with a magic wand, as if it doesn't exist, even though it could not be clearer
[02:56:28.457 --> 02:56:57.877]  What it's stating and so you know they want to kick it to Congress so it's going to be up to us on January 6, 2025 to tell the rampaging Trump mobs that he's disqualified and then we need bodyguards for everybody and civil war conditions all because the nine justices, not all of them, but these justices who have not many cases to look at every year, not that much work to do, a huge staff, great protection, simply do not want
[02:56:59.398 --> 02:57:20.129]  So there's the Democrat Party operative Raskin saying the legislative will override the judicial and the executive and will be in civil war conditions and the rampaging Trump mobs that they'll finance
[02:57:21.920 --> 02:57:22.820]  They've got to be dealt with.
[02:57:22.860 --> 02:57:26.462]  This is open fantasizing about civil war.
[02:57:27.222 --> 02:57:27.942]  In his own words.
[02:57:28.963 --> 02:57:37.866]  They've got the new viruses cooked up, and the war is cooked up, and just all of this, and big tech, cyber outages, and stock market crashes.
[02:57:38.106 --> 02:57:41.708]  We are in such a crisis with what, 91 days?
[02:57:42.288 --> 02:57:43.228]  How many days of the election?
[02:57:44.169 --> 02:57:44.809]  Totally insane.
[02:57:45.720 --> 02:57:48.081]  All right, I just did three hours and eight minutes of show.
[02:57:48.101 --> 02:57:50.503]  I think I plugged like two minutes in the show.
[02:57:51.223 --> 02:57:53.124]  If I don't plug and you don't buy products, we're not here.
[02:57:53.184 --> 02:57:53.985]  Plus, they're great products.
[02:57:54.005 --> 02:57:56.006]  I want to thank you all for your past support.
[02:57:56.486 --> 02:57:59.648]  I want to encourage you to commit and decide, hey, this information is important.
[02:58:00.028 --> 02:58:01.329]  Plus, I want to check these products out.
[02:58:01.629 --> 02:58:04.230]  I want to thank those that have gotten the products and have been longtime supporters.
[02:58:04.250 --> 02:58:04.911]  You're the reason we're here.
[02:58:05.251 --> 02:58:06.972]  But I want to talk to folks that never have.
[02:58:08.831 --> 02:58:11.533]  Because I mean, I say 1% by products, it's like 1 tenth of 1%.
[02:58:12.934 --> 02:58:20.680]  All of you, by the millions and millions and millions, we're on hundreds of radio stations and millions on X and millions of M4s, millions of people.
[02:58:21.080 --> 02:58:23.162]  Hell, we're probably reaching 30 million people a day right now.
[02:58:25.083 --> 02:58:27.365]  And I'm sitting here literally
[02:58:29.178 --> 02:58:30.118]  You need water filtration.
[02:58:30.138 --> 02:58:31.158]  We have the best water filtration.
[02:58:31.518 --> 02:58:32.219]  I didn't just say that.
[02:58:32.239 --> 02:58:34.859]  We have the best water filtration at the lowest prices.

[02:59:46.800 --> 02:59:48.180]  It takes money to fight a war.
[02:59:48.440 --> 02:59:49.181]  These are great products.
[02:59:49.201 --> 02:59:49.661]  You'll love them.
[02:59:50.141 --> 02:59:54.702]  Infowarsstore.com or drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:59:55.122 --> 02:59:59.683]  All right, the great Gerald Cilente takes over now.
[02:59:59.763 --> 03:00:00.483]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:00:01.043 --> 03:00:08.025]  And again, like Alex said, you know, it takes money to fight a war, and they steal all our money to keep fighting these wars.
[03:00:08.968 --> 03:00:13.550]  So do what you can to support... Well, I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[03:00:14.090 --> 03:00:18.833]  InfoWars is giving you information of freedom, peace, and justice.
[03:00:19.793 --> 03:00:20.894]  They say what they say.
[03:00:21.194 --> 03:00:22.775]  They don't tell you what to believe.
[03:00:22.795 --> 03:00:26.416]  And this is the way they see it, like we do with the Trends Journal.
[03:00:27.157 --> 03:00:29.038]  So we're at very critical times right now.
[03:00:29.618 --> 03:00:31.979]  So do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[03:00:32.059 --> 03:00:35.060]  Go to their site, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:00:35.080 --> 03:00:38.102]  They got great bargains and great products.
[03:00:38.973 --> 03:00:49.636]  And like Alex said, you know, how many percent are really supporting InfoWars when you're getting all this information with great guests that he brings on all the time, and the insights and observations?
[03:00:49.716 --> 03:00:51.236]  The same thing with the Trends Journal.
[03:00:51.676 --> 03:00:55.777]  You go to TrendsJournal.com and JonesTrends.com and you get a break on it.
[03:00:55.797 --> 03:00:57.838]  We're giving you what nobody else in the world is giving you.
[03:00:58.718 --> 03:01:00.338]  So, do you support it?
[03:01:00.559 --> 03:01:01.179]  You know, don't.
[03:01:01.539 --> 03:01:03.979]  You know, just swallow the crap.
[03:01:04.380 --> 03:01:06.120]  And speaking about swallowing the crap,
[03:01:06.721 --> 03:01:11.042]  I was listening to that guy Ratkin or Raitkin or Ratface.
[03:01:13.002 --> 03:01:14.143]  I'm looking at that clip.
[03:01:14.783 --> 03:01:16.283]  What has he got, a wig on over there?
[03:01:16.303 --> 03:01:19.564]  He's got this phony little black hair.
[03:01:19.584 --> 03:01:22.224]  He looks like a little clown.
[03:01:22.244 --> 03:01:26.625]  And he's talking about the constitutional rights.
[03:01:26.985 --> 03:01:30.546]  What's put into the constitution can be taken away from us.
[03:01:30.746 --> 03:01:32.287]  Yeah, look at that little wig.
[03:01:32.367 --> 03:01:33.867]  Is that a little wig he got on?
[03:01:34.837 --> 03:01:38.499]  It looks like it's right out of, is this a Disney world?
[03:01:38.940 --> 03:01:40.020]  What is he speaking to?
[03:01:40.120 --> 03:01:41.421]  Is Mickey Mouse out there?
[03:01:41.821 --> 03:01:42.262]  Look at this.
[03:01:43.182 --> 03:01:44.103]  I mean, I don't know.
[03:01:44.123 --> 03:01:47.645]  I mean, but you know, like, you know, I'm an older cat.
[03:01:47.705 --> 03:01:50.387]  I don't got a wig and I don't dye my hair, you know?
[03:01:52.268 --> 03:01:53.789]  An arrogant little boy.
[03:01:53.809 --> 03:01:55.149]  All of them.
[03:01:56.210 --> 03:01:56.430]  All of them.
[03:01:58.051 --> 03:01:59.112]  Once upon a time,
[03:02:03.459 --> 03:02:05.360]  People were free to be who they wanted to be.
[03:02:05.380 --> 03:02:07.141]  That's right.
[03:02:08.161 --> 03:02:09.341]  Don't tell me what to do.
[03:02:09.662 --> 03:02:10.922]  I won't tell you when to do.
[03:02:11.322 --> 03:02:11.622]  Got it?
[03:02:12.383 --> 03:02:13.123]  Not anymore.
[03:02:13.803 --> 03:02:14.544]  Not anymore.
[03:02:15.044 --> 03:02:23.927]  You gotta swallow the crap spewing out of the mouth of little clown boys like him and one after another.
[03:02:24.388 --> 03:02:25.928]  Oh, you like Nancy Pelosi?
[03:02:26.168 --> 03:02:27.449]  No, I like Lindsey.
[03:02:27.469 --> 03:02:29.550]  Did you come out of the closet yet, Graham?
[03:02:31.181 --> 03:02:34.242]  How about Chucky Schumer?
[03:02:35.663 --> 03:02:40.025]  One little jerk after another in a country near you.
[03:02:40.045 --> 03:02:50.469]  Yeah, another wig cat is that little clown boy with a thing about this big that kissing that other guy, that little Garcon Macron over there in France.
[03:02:50.649 --> 03:02:56.131]  Once upon a time, humanity was free to be free.
[03:02:56.931 --> 03:02:57.492]  But now, no.
[03:02:59.341 --> 03:03:01.863]  Only the politicians will tell you what to do.
[03:03:02.303 --> 03:03:04.025]  You obey what we tell you.
[03:03:04.465 --> 03:03:09.929]  I'm little Andy Cuomo, an arrogant daddy's boy that likes to feel up chicks.
[03:03:10.389 --> 03:03:11.510]  Oh, that's what they say.
[03:03:11.530 --> 03:03:17.915]  I'm a nobody, but my daddy was Mario Cuomo.
[03:03:18.275 --> 03:03:20.036]  Lock down your businesses.
[03:03:23.919 --> 03:03:24.860]  One after another.
[03:03:26.149 --> 03:03:27.910]  Little Godson Gavin Newsom.
[03:03:28.170 --> 03:03:30.310]  Oh, I got my money from the Getty gang.
[03:03:30.370 --> 03:03:31.911]  How do you think I made what I made?
[03:03:32.171 --> 03:03:34.011]  And my daddy worked for the Gettys.
[03:03:35.832 --> 03:03:37.212]  I'll tell you what to do.
[03:03:37.553 --> 03:03:39.353]  You have... Oh, talking about freedom.
[03:03:39.393 --> 03:03:40.153]  Look at this guy.
[03:03:40.413 --> 03:03:41.634]  Little Godson of nothing.
[03:03:43.554 --> 03:03:46.976]  Little boys and girls telling us what to do and how to behave.
[03:03:47.736 --> 03:03:49.336]  Said a little clown Raskin.
[03:03:52.577 --> 03:03:54.578]  Yeah, little arrogant boys.
[03:03:55.839 --> 03:03:57.600]  Telling about the Constitution?
[03:03:58.060 --> 03:03:58.261]  Hey!
[03:03:58.461 --> 03:03:59.201]  Hey, Gatson!
[03:03:59.861 --> 03:04:01.683]  How about freedom of speech?
[03:04:02.703 --> 03:04:04.684]  How about the right to bear arms?
[03:04:06.085 --> 03:04:07.406]  Go to hell, Salenti!
[03:04:07.906 --> 03:04:08.947]  You're a nobody!
[03:04:09.187 --> 03:04:11.669]  You're just a little giddy from the Bronx!
[03:04:13.730 --> 03:04:15.351]  You're not a member of the club!
[03:04:16.932 --> 03:04:18.233]  We'll tell you what to do!
[03:04:18.513 --> 03:04:18.953]  Oh, hey!
[03:04:20.354 --> 03:04:23.896]  Why don't you come over here, any one of you guys, any one of you!
[03:04:24.708 --> 03:04:42.338]  Any one of the names I mention, and anybody in Congress, any president around the world, you come over here, tell me, man-to-man, or transgender-to-man, or girl-to-man, you tell me what to do.
[03:04:42.998 --> 03:04:45.980]  And then you try to make me do what you want me to do.
[03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:46.720]  Come on!
[03:04:47.380 --> 03:04:47.741]  Come on!
[03:04:49.602 --> 03:04:51.503]  Why, Solenti, you're angry?
[03:04:52.443 --> 03:04:53.784]  You have to do what we're told?
[03:04:54.918 --> 03:04:55.138]  Yeah.
[03:04:55.899 --> 03:04:56.940]  Little clown boy.
[03:04:58.000 --> 03:04:59.461]  My daddy's Mario.
[03:04:59.802 --> 03:05:02.463]  I'm renaming the Tappan Zee Bridge after my daddy.
[03:05:02.784 --> 03:05:04.385]  And there's my brother Chrissy.
[03:05:04.625 --> 03:05:10.329]  A little nobody, but now he gets jobs anywhere because he's a member of the club.
[03:05:11.650 --> 03:05:16.273]  When I used to be on CNN and everybody, I used to run into Chris Cuomo back in the day.
[03:05:17.114 --> 03:05:18.135]  I'm going back in the 90s.
[03:05:18.895 --> 03:05:20.016]  Hey Chris, how you doing?
[03:05:20.056 --> 03:05:20.236]  Good.
[03:05:20.536 --> 03:05:21.097]  How's your father?
[03:05:21.553 --> 03:05:24.834]  He was doing sports and pop culture.
[03:05:24.854 --> 03:05:27.555]  He had little girls with him, his little aides.
[03:05:28.095 --> 03:05:30.436]  Again, it's one big club and you ain't in it.
[03:05:31.156 --> 03:05:42.359]  And going back to Trump, again, I was the first magazine in the Trends Journal to call him a winner in May of 2016, when everybody said he was going to lose.
[03:05:44.680 --> 03:05:48.561]  The day after he got elected,
[03:05:51.647 --> 03:05:58.852]  The cover story, in USA Today, new president has eight lawsuits or something behind him.
[03:06:00.493 --> 03:06:02.915]  They've been going after Trump, and again, I'm not a Trump fan.
[03:06:03.215 --> 03:06:04.636]  I'm not a Harris fan.
[03:06:05.117 --> 03:06:06.157]  I don't like either party.
[03:06:06.518 --> 03:06:07.798]  They're a crime syndicate to me.
[03:06:08.119 --> 03:06:10.460]  I'm a trend forecaster, I call him like I see him.
[03:06:13.543 --> 03:06:19.727]  Russiagate, one thing after another, going after Trump.
[03:06:22.199 --> 03:06:23.339]  As soon as he got elected.
[03:06:25.860 --> 03:06:26.920]  Total criminality.
[03:06:28.681 --> 03:06:43.484]  And, again, I was doing USA Watchdog on election day and election night with Greg Hunter.
[03:06:44.625 --> 03:06:47.505]  And we're watching all the votes come in.
[03:06:47.545 --> 03:06:49.746]  It's, you know, Trump's up here and Biden's under.
[03:06:49.766 --> 03:06:50.426]  And all of a sudden,
[03:06:51.423 --> 03:06:59.626]  I forget the exact number, like 112,000 write-in votes come in for Wisconsin or Michigan or someplace, and not one for Trump?
[03:07:00.866 --> 03:07:01.906]  I mean, what am I, six years old?
[03:07:01.926 --> 03:07:02.847]  Who are you talking to over here?
[03:07:03.627 --> 03:07:07.648]  And by the way, it was Trump that gave us the write-in ballots, so he did it himself.
[03:07:08.228 --> 03:07:09.048]  He did it himself.
[03:07:12.349 --> 03:07:14.730]  And one after another, Michigan had come in with 115,000 votes, none for Trump?
[03:07:19.266 --> 03:07:21.948]  So yes, I believe the election was stolen.
[03:07:24.030 --> 03:07:24.710]  Absolutely.
[03:07:26.652 --> 03:07:29.074]  Hey, remember the hanging chads?
[03:07:29.254 --> 03:07:30.955]  It's not only the demo craps.
[03:07:31.836 --> 03:07:35.518]  Remember little Georgie Bush with a pair of cojones smaller than a mothball?
[03:07:37.100 --> 03:07:37.640]  Remember him?
[03:07:37.660 --> 03:07:40.262]  Remember the hanging chads?
[03:07:41.343 --> 03:07:42.344]  You forgot about those?
[03:07:43.084 --> 03:07:45.246]  In Florida, where he beat Gore?
[03:07:46.587 --> 03:07:47.728]  Go back to JFK.
[03:07:49.125 --> 03:07:52.608]  Mayor Daley running a crime syndicate in Chicago.
[03:07:52.988 --> 03:07:54.749]  They say he rigged the markets for Illinois.
[03:07:54.769 --> 03:07:57.231]  Yep.
[03:08:00.493 --> 03:08:01.594]  So this is the game.
[03:08:02.895 --> 03:08:04.095]  It's a crime syndicate.
[03:08:04.135 --> 03:08:05.156]  I don't like any of them.
[03:08:07.998 --> 03:08:08.378]  None of them.
[03:08:10.220 --> 03:08:11.741]  So I only call it the way it is.
[03:08:14.102 --> 03:08:14.943]  And when I called,
[03:08:17.148 --> 03:08:26.195]  In our special trend alert that went out on July 25th, Kamala Harris 2024.
[03:08:28.356 --> 03:08:31.558]  The Trends Journal's May 2022 forecast.
[03:08:32.619 --> 03:08:39.904]  The Trends Journal had forecast that Joe Biden would step down and Kamala Harris would run for president in 2024.
[03:08:41.005 --> 03:08:43.107]  And now we forecast, you ready?
[03:08:44.367 --> 03:08:45.108]  First paragraph.
[03:08:46.656 --> 03:08:56.040]  Minus a wild card, such as a stock market crash, Harris will beat Trump in the race to the White House.
[03:08:57.460 --> 03:08:57.981]  Guess what?
[03:08:59.141 --> 03:09:00.262]  The markets are crashing.
[03:09:03.003 --> 03:09:14.668]  As we said, minus a wild card event, like a market crash, Harris wins.
[03:09:15.368 --> 03:09:15.588]  Again,
[03:09:16.118 --> 03:09:17.318]  You call it like I see it.
[03:09:17.358 --> 03:09:19.159]  People hate me for saying this, by the way.
[03:09:19.919 --> 03:09:22.040]  And I make it very clear why we say this.
[03:09:22.220 --> 03:09:26.862]  The same reason why the Republicans didn't do well in the midterm elections.
[03:09:28.322 --> 03:09:33.704]  And that was because, and we say it in the Trends Journal, we repeat it, all the facts are here.
[03:09:33.724 --> 03:09:44.428]  This is going back to May of 2022, when the midterm elections, we said that, where is it here?
[03:09:45.185 --> 03:09:53.852]  Harris will seize upon abortion rights because there seems to be only two things she can use to unite her front, Ukraine war and pro-abortion.
[03:09:54.813 --> 03:10:01.959]  And we said that the Republicans wouldn't do well in the midterm elections because of their anti-abortion stance.
[03:10:02.079 --> 03:10:07.303]  Again, it's not like what you want, what you wish, what you believe in.
[03:10:08.384 --> 03:10:09.505]  We're trying to forecast this.
[03:10:09.585 --> 03:10:11.587]  It's what is and what happens.
[03:10:12.338 --> 03:10:17.782]  The Republicans didn't do well in the midterm elections because of the Roe versus Wade thing that they popped out.
[03:10:19.002 --> 03:10:20.824]  That they all of a sudden just popped out.
[03:10:20.844 --> 03:10:22.044]  I wonder how it popped out.
[03:10:22.705 --> 03:10:22.905]  Yeah.
[03:10:24.786 --> 03:10:26.247]  The crime syndicate popped it out.
[03:10:27.568 --> 03:10:29.029]  And that became the major issue.
[03:10:30.070 --> 03:10:31.731]  It's a one-issue world.
[03:10:33.052 --> 03:10:35.994]  Again, in trend forecasting, all things are connected.
[03:10:37.695 --> 03:10:40.597]  And now we have to look again at the equity markets.
[03:10:40.757 --> 03:10:41.097]  And again,
[03:10:42.513 --> 03:10:43.693]  We call it like it is.
[03:10:43.953 --> 03:10:47.714]  And we call the politicians out for who they are, like them, dislike them.
[03:10:48.875 --> 03:10:59.197]  And what we have been saying is that the Fed needs to lower interest rates because the economy is going to slow down.
[03:11:01.658 --> 03:11:09.920]  And now they're calling the Fed to lower interest rates because as we, you know, we're seeing in front of all our eyes what the markets are doing.
[03:11:10.768 --> 03:11:15.270]  When it came on the air, what was the Dow down over 1,000 points?
[03:11:19.453 --> 03:11:20.753]  NASDAQ way down?
[03:11:22.634 --> 03:11:23.695]  S&P way down?
[03:11:26.076 --> 03:11:28.758]  How about over there in Japan?
[03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:33.300]  Yep.
[03:11:35.261 --> 03:11:36.342]  How about over... yeah, look at that.
[03:11:36.682 --> 03:11:36.922]  Again.
[03:11:37.876 --> 03:11:39.616]  Again, you like her, you hate her.
[03:11:40.196 --> 03:11:41.637]  Again, I can't stand any of them.
[03:11:41.877 --> 03:11:43.737]  Don't like her, phony as could be.
[03:11:45.237 --> 03:11:47.438]  But look, she's dancing.
[03:11:48.338 --> 03:11:50.398]  And Trump comes out angry all the time.
[03:11:50.778 --> 03:11:53.319]  You gotta entertain the people, you understand?
[03:11:54.019 --> 03:11:55.939]  That's one of the old lines from an old jazz song.
[03:11:56.379 --> 03:11:58.020]  Entertain the people, you understand?
[03:11:58.040 --> 03:12:00.320]  And they're gonna entertain the people.
[03:12:01.820 --> 03:12:03.401]  But again, it goes back to the markets.
[03:12:04.201 --> 03:12:05.821]  And again, you go back.
[03:12:06.843 --> 03:12:07.804]  About interest rates.
[03:12:09.145 --> 03:12:10.866]  Well, first the Nikkei I was talking about.
[03:12:11.926 --> 03:12:14.228]  It had a one day trading loss of 12.4%.
[03:12:15.209 --> 03:12:16.970]  Yeah, but he's too angry all the time.
[03:12:16.990 --> 03:12:18.991]  12 point, he can't boogie.
[03:12:19.171 --> 03:12:21.112]  Got no boogie, got no jab.
[03:12:22.473 --> 03:12:24.294]  Anyway, the Nikkei is down over 12%.
[03:12:24.435 --> 03:12:26.916]  It was the worst time ever.
[03:12:27.497 --> 03:12:28.297]  One day trading loss.
[03:12:29.458 --> 03:12:30.178]  This is serious.
[03:12:30.298 --> 03:12:31.639]  And you know why the Nikkei went down?
[03:12:32.080 --> 03:12:34.941]  They say because of the bad data coming out from the United States.
[03:12:35.022 --> 03:12:35.682]  That's not true.
[03:12:37.042 --> 03:12:39.223]  They had negative and zero interest rate policies.
[03:12:39.243 --> 03:12:42.084]  They've been buying up government treasuries for forever.
[03:12:42.604 --> 03:12:45.085]  I mean, probably over a decade.
[03:12:46.145 --> 03:12:54.168]  And they just raised, they just raised their interest rate from zero to 0.25.
[03:12:55.128 --> 03:12:56.369]  And that brought down the markets.
[03:12:58.469 --> 03:13:02.511]  The world needs cheap money to keep the artificial game flowing.
[03:13:05.191 --> 03:13:06.552]  So as the markets went down,
[03:13:07.907 --> 03:13:10.608]  I would have thought gold prices would have gone much higher.
[03:13:11.428 --> 03:13:11.888]  They didn't.
[03:13:11.948 --> 03:13:12.909]  They came down today.
[03:13:14.949 --> 03:13:16.710]  At one point, they were down $71 an ounce.
[03:13:16.890 --> 03:13:20.831]  We went on the air, they're down like $38 an ounce.
[03:13:20.851 --> 03:13:23.672]  But gold is still at $2,406 an ounce as we went on the air.
[03:13:23.732 --> 03:13:24.692]  Now your NASDAQ
[03:13:35.714 --> 03:13:37.156]  Is down over 10 percent.
[03:13:37.356 --> 03:13:38.858]  That's correction territory.
[03:13:38.978 --> 03:13:40.080]  Goes down 20 percent.
[03:13:40.540 --> 03:13:41.461]  That's a bear market.
[03:13:43.904 --> 03:13:45.987]  And we're facing bear market turmoil.
[03:13:48.230 --> 03:13:51.514]  And one of my lines is when all else fails they take you to war.
[03:13:52.996 --> 03:13:54.418]  So going back to the markets.
[03:13:55.600 --> 03:13:56.901]  They'll get the people's minds off it.
[03:13:56.921 --> 03:13:58.081]  The people go to war like that.
[03:13:58.121 --> 03:14:06.526]  Again, 90% of the people swallow the crap spewing out of that little daddy's boy's mouth, little Georgie Bush, a little nothing of a clown.
[03:14:06.546 --> 03:14:08.948]  We're gonna get that guy Osama bin Laden?
[03:14:08.988 --> 03:14:09.828]  They're alive!
[03:14:10.428 --> 03:14:10.609]  Yeah.
[03:14:12.750 --> 03:14:14.771]  They call the war, matter of fact, Trump did.
[03:14:16.069 --> 03:14:25.874]  And one person after another, one of the leaders, our leaders, our political crap heads in a country, city, and state near you, called it a war.
[03:14:26.455 --> 03:14:28.376]  And everybody marched off to the COVID war.
[03:14:29.556 --> 03:14:36.960]  There's going to be a false flag event that's going to drag us into the war in Israel and Ukraine.
[03:14:38.681 --> 03:14:42.283]  Oh, the United States, now they're seeing the F-15s over there now?
[03:14:43.103 --> 03:14:43.623]  Isn't that great?
[03:14:44.064 --> 03:14:45.745]  As our country's rotting in front of us?
[03:14:50.528 --> 03:14:57.091]  So, going back to the markets, and Trump by the way, Trump said came out not to lower interest rates.
[03:14:58.072 --> 03:15:04.316]  He just came out with that, it was in Politico a little while ago, and a couple of days ago, last Wednesday.
[03:15:05.457 --> 03:15:07.438]  And now, he's changing his tune, I think.
[03:15:08.218 --> 03:15:10.980]  Because, the um,
[03:15:14.025 --> 03:15:21.149]  High interest rates are what brought, here we go, Fed poised to cut rates ignoring Trump and GOP lawmakers.
[03:15:21.229 --> 03:15:24.331]  This is Politico last Wednesday, the 31st.
[03:15:25.611 --> 03:15:32.975]  Federal Reserve Chairman Powell looks to start easing off on the economy before the elections.
[03:15:35.937 --> 03:15:43.481]  Former President Donald Trump recently told Bloomberg News that cutting rates just weeks ahead of the November vote quote,
[03:15:44.195 --> 03:15:48.177]  It's something that central bank officials know they shouldn't be doing.
[03:15:50.458 --> 03:15:56.581]  And multiple Republican lawmakers also suggested that such a move could raise questions of political bias.
[03:15:59.223 --> 03:16:01.104]  So, definitely political bias.
[03:16:02.785 --> 03:16:03.245]  We thought.
[03:16:05.826 --> 03:16:09.348]  We had forecast that the Fed would have already cut interest rates.
[03:16:10.506 --> 03:16:14.647]  Because as trend forecasters, we saw the dangers of the economy ahead.
[03:16:14.667 --> 03:16:16.227]  You saw the job numbers came out.
[03:16:16.707 --> 03:16:20.508]  You saw the manufacturing numbers that are in negative territory.
[03:16:22.108 --> 03:16:31.890]  So we thought that to push Harris or whatever Democrat was running to keep them in power, they would have lowered rates by now.
[03:16:33.190 --> 03:16:36.691]  And now everyone's coming out and saying they should lower interest rates.
[03:16:38.751 --> 03:16:39.431]  So what does that mean?
[03:16:40.666 --> 03:16:45.067]  Now they're saying they're going to lower interest rates by 50 basis points in September.
[03:16:45.608 --> 03:16:48.469]  And now talks that the Fed may even rush before then.
[03:16:50.389 --> 03:16:53.210]  Again, they're going to do everything they can to juice up the economy.
[03:16:54.090 --> 03:16:56.131]  They want to keep the people in power in power.
[03:16:56.651 --> 03:16:57.812]  The former Fed head, Ms.
[03:16:57.852 --> 03:17:03.013]  Fatshah Brut, Janet Yellen, is now our Treasury Secretary.
[03:17:03.053 --> 03:17:03.913]  What are you, six years old?
[03:17:03.953 --> 03:17:05.494]  Can't you see who's running the money in the country?
[03:17:06.034 --> 03:17:06.474]  The Feds.
[03:17:07.215 --> 03:17:08.595]  They want to keep the power in power.
[03:17:11.311 --> 03:17:12.191]  Now let's go back.
[03:17:12.632 --> 03:17:17.554]  When they lower interest rates, the dollar goes down.
[03:17:19.295 --> 03:17:23.197]  As the dollar goes down, gold prices go up.
[03:17:24.618 --> 03:17:28.219]  We can see gold hitting $3,000 an ounce this year.
[03:17:29.480 --> 03:17:32.362]  It is a wild ride into the future.
[03:17:32.482 --> 03:17:34.803]  I've been at this for 44 years.
[03:17:35.523 --> 03:17:40.266]  Never have I seen a freak show like the freaks are put on in front of us.
[03:17:40.846 --> 03:17:41.006]  Yep.
[03:17:43.163 --> 03:17:44.084]  It's a freak show.
[03:17:45.206 --> 03:17:53.417]  The markets, the wars, all of this, this social mind changing.
[03:17:53.918 --> 03:17:54.699]  We're going to be back.
[03:17:54.939 --> 03:17:55.420]  Stay tuned.
[03:17:56.303 --> 03:18:00.286]  You've seen what President Trump has gone through in the last eight years.
[03:18:00.926 --> 03:18:03.087]  And you've seen a lot of the things that Infowars has gone through.
[03:18:03.107 --> 03:18:09.751]  And I want to thank all of you over the years for your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support, because without you, we would not be on the air.
[03:18:10.292 --> 03:18:14.935]  Now, without getting into a two-hour long story, in the process of the bankruptcy in the last two years,
[03:18:15.615 --> 03:18:27.168]  We were basically sabotaged and the people that were brought in here to supposedly run things didn't reorder product, even though there was plenty of money at the time, to basically put this operation in a position of shutting down.
[03:18:27.789 --> 03:18:32.675]  But by the grace of God, years ago, I set up backup supplement line
[03:18:33.115 --> 03:18:36.556]  From one of the main providers of the raw materials we were using.
[03:18:36.977 --> 03:18:43.039]  And so many of these InfoWars MD products are actually our famous products, simply private labeled.
[03:18:43.359 --> 03:18:46.140]  And others are different formulas this company offers.
[03:18:46.460 --> 03:18:47.480]  They're all top of the line.
[03:18:47.500 --> 03:18:48.521]  They're already best sellers.
[03:18:48.821 --> 03:18:52.422]  They're already all over the market and in stores and online under other names.
[03:18:52.682 --> 03:18:54.283]  But they are all the very best.
[03:18:54.763 --> 03:18:56.864]  So this line is called InfoWars MD.
[03:18:57.888 --> 03:18:59.611]  Our supplements are basically all sold out.
[03:18:59.971 --> 03:19:03.616]  Only a few things are left, like X2, X3, and some of the other amazing products.
[03:19:04.036 --> 03:19:06.580]  But with InfoWars MD, you have Turmeric 95.
[03:19:07.100 --> 03:19:09.984]  That is the same formula as Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[03:19:10.345 --> 03:19:12.227]  You have the Nitric Boost.
[03:19:12.247 --> 03:19:14.009]  It's so good for your heart cardiovascular system.
[03:19:14.350 --> 03:19:15.852]  It is the exact same
[03:19:16.092 --> 03:19:16.832]  Thank you.
[03:19:37.985 --> 03:19:39.945]  Get great products and help keep us on the air.
[03:19:40.046 --> 03:19:41.246]  I need you to take action.
[03:19:41.546 --> 03:19:42.666]  You will love these products.
[03:19:42.906 --> 03:19:44.246]  They work really, really good.
[03:19:44.266 --> 03:19:54.509]  No matter which one you try, they're already top of the line, tested, private label by us, available right now at InfoWarsStore.com under the InfoWars MD label.
[03:19:54.709 --> 03:19:55.529]  Thank you for your support.
[03:19:55.829 --> 03:19:57.889]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:58.390 --> 03:20:05.031]  And as I keep saying, and will continue to say over and over again, do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[03:20:06.049 --> 03:20:07.870]  The staff works tirelessly.
[03:20:09.251 --> 03:20:13.054]  Could you imagine if the billionaires backed InfoWars?
[03:20:15.295 --> 03:20:17.336]  Or my Occupy Peace Movement?
[03:20:17.356 --> 03:20:18.317]  We'd have peace in a minute.
[03:20:19.838 --> 03:20:20.358]  But they don't.
[03:20:21.479 --> 03:20:24.321]  They only back the politicians.
[03:20:25.942 --> 03:20:27.323]  Again, it's a crime syndicate.
[03:20:27.803 --> 03:20:29.144]  What did Kamala Harris raise?
[03:20:29.164 --> 03:20:33.267]  Like about $370 million since she's announced that she's running?
[03:20:34.016 --> 03:20:36.536]  Trump, like, 420 million or something he's got?
[03:20:36.556 --> 03:20:40.437]  I mean, who else could run for office if you don't have all the money behind you?
[03:20:41.597 --> 03:20:43.818]  So how do you have- you need money to make it happen.
[03:20:44.218 --> 03:20:45.538]  I mean, that's the world of today.
[03:20:46.738 --> 03:20:50.979]  So by buying these products, you're helping it happen with InfoWars, so do what you can.
[03:20:50.999 --> 03:20:55.880]  You know, I want to talk more about the economy, because again, we've been forecasting this.
[03:20:56.400 --> 03:20:57.980]  Go back to your Trends Journal in May.
[03:20:59.740 --> 03:21:00.401]  What did we say?
[03:21:01.681 --> 03:21:02.441]  Sell in May,
[03:21:03.007 --> 03:21:03.868]  And go away.
[03:21:05.148 --> 03:21:06.629]  That's the old line they use.
[03:21:07.490 --> 03:21:13.333]  Because markets are artificially boosted up often during the summer and then they go way down.
[03:21:13.793 --> 03:21:14.594]  This isn't new.
[03:21:16.275 --> 03:21:23.059]  What's going to have to happen is we have to see what's going to happen after Labor Day weekend.
[03:21:23.659 --> 03:21:25.180]  That's when another reality hits.
[03:21:25.300 --> 03:21:26.561]  And this is also important.
[03:21:28.022 --> 03:21:28.802]  This is August.
[03:21:30.163 --> 03:21:31.144]  Boy, it's hot up here too.
[03:21:35.438 --> 03:21:37.039]  People are in a summer state of mind.
[03:21:37.960 --> 03:21:39.741]  Most people are tuned out to the facts.
[03:21:40.002 --> 03:21:41.323]  Oh, but they're watching the Olympics.
[03:21:41.363 --> 03:21:42.464]  They know everything about that.
[03:21:44.385 --> 03:21:45.666]  They don't have a clue what's going on.
[03:21:47.988 --> 03:21:54.373]  The real market crisis is going to come to light by mid-September.
[03:21:54.754 --> 03:21:56.835]  But again, anything could happen between now and then.
[03:21:57.856 --> 03:22:01.839]  So going back to the markets, when we took a break, I went to see what the Dow was.
[03:22:01.939 --> 03:22:02.580]  It was down 1,086 points.
[03:22:06.661 --> 03:22:07.922]  Gold moved up a little bit.
[03:22:11.243 --> 03:22:12.584]  Crypto has taken a beating.
[03:22:12.604 --> 03:22:13.804]  It's down over 10%.
[03:22:14.585 --> 03:22:20.848]  And again, you know, I've been on with other people on this show and on InfoWars that love Bitcoin.
[03:22:20.888 --> 03:22:22.028]  And I say, yeah, it's a gamble.
[03:22:22.488 --> 03:22:23.129]  I gambled it.
[03:22:24.189 --> 03:22:25.490]  I bought Bitcoin at $17,000.
[03:22:25.530 --> 03:22:27.211]  That's when I first got into it.
[03:22:28.531 --> 03:22:29.912]  And I have always said it's a gamble.
[03:22:30.792 --> 03:22:31.893]  Gold is a different trip.
[03:22:34.140 --> 03:22:45.883]  And while gold prices are going down, again, everybody, everywhere, any place is going to forecast that they're going to lower interest rates.
[03:22:47.243 --> 03:22:50.124]  And when interest rates go down, the dollar goes down.
[03:22:50.584 --> 03:22:54.225]  And when the dollar goes down, gold is dollar based.
[03:22:54.325 --> 03:23:00.907]  It's cheaper for other countries to buy gold if you're from those countries because your currency went up.
[03:23:02.438 --> 03:23:03.839]  So that's what we're gonna see happen.
[03:23:05.080 --> 03:23:12.888]  And again, I would have thought the Fed would have lowered interest rates to keep the people in power in power.
[03:23:13.929 --> 03:23:15.390]  So now let's go back to the markets.
[03:23:16.351 --> 03:23:18.833]  There's a thing called the Plunge Protection Team.
[03:23:19.073 --> 03:23:19.874]  New York Feds.
[03:23:21.295 --> 03:23:22.436]  The Bankster Bandits.
[03:23:24.398 --> 03:23:25.359]  Right on Wall Street.
[03:23:27.261 --> 03:23:28.302]  Plunge Protection Team?
[03:23:28.846 --> 03:23:32.467]  Oh yes, Salenti, we'll rig the markets if they're not going down too low.
[03:23:33.147 --> 03:23:34.207]  But don't worry about it.
[03:23:34.767 --> 03:23:39.088]  We're going to tell all our buddies when we do this.
[03:23:40.508 --> 03:23:42.069]  So they're going to go long.
[03:23:42.989 --> 03:23:44.369]  And we're going to drive the market up.
[03:23:45.149 --> 03:23:45.630]  That's right.
[03:23:46.190 --> 03:23:48.670]  It's going to be a phony pump, but we do it all the time.
[03:23:50.551 --> 03:23:51.491]  China got one.
[03:23:51.991 --> 03:23:52.571]  They all got one.
[03:23:53.976 --> 03:23:59.080]  I love it when you read this stuff like from CNBC or Wall Street Journal.
[03:23:59.720 --> 03:24:00.401]  Investors?
[03:24:00.441 --> 03:24:01.401]  What investors?
[03:24:02.562 --> 03:24:03.923]  It's a gambler's market.
[03:24:06.305 --> 03:24:13.951]  Again, we're looking now at the NASDAQ in correction territory.
[03:24:14.311 --> 03:24:18.034]  Down some 10%, as is the S&P 500.
[03:24:20.896 --> 03:24:21.997]  Barely down almost 10%.
[03:24:25.501 --> 03:24:30.082]  Again, as we said, you sell in May and go away.
[03:24:31.163 --> 03:24:32.263]  It's a rig time.
[03:24:32.883 --> 03:24:35.244]  Less people trading and more rigging.
[03:24:36.824 --> 03:24:38.845]  But this is serious what's going on.
[03:24:38.865 --> 03:24:50.269]  You're looking across, again, the terrible numbers coming out of Japan, but you look at the European stocks down on average about, what, 2% today?
[03:24:51.629 --> 03:24:52.909]  This is going to get a lot worse.
[03:24:58.598 --> 03:25:00.979]  I mentioned before about the weak numbers coming out.
[03:25:01.960 --> 03:25:06.502]  The Institute for Supply Management, that's the ISM report, it came out.
[03:25:07.542 --> 03:25:10.384]  Manufacturing activity, you ready?
[03:25:10.884 --> 03:25:16.627]  It dove to an eight month low last month in July.
[03:25:20.669 --> 03:25:24.451]  It was in negative territory before that at 48.5 level in June.
[03:25:28.769 --> 03:25:30.511]  And now it's at 46.8.
[03:25:31.311 --> 03:25:35.275]  Anything under 50, decline.
[03:25:38.798 --> 03:25:42.762]  Then they came out with the labor statistic numbers last week.
[03:25:42.782 --> 03:25:44.143]  114,000 jobs were created.
[03:25:44.163 --> 03:25:46.465]  And they averaged about 215,000 a month for the last 12 months.
[03:25:57.412 --> 03:25:59.433]  The job numbers stink.
[03:26:00.313 --> 03:26:05.414]  And they even keep lowering them from their initial estimates.
[03:26:06.415 --> 03:26:08.855]  This will probably go down to 100,000.
[03:26:10.296 --> 03:26:13.377]  Then you have to look at what are the jobs being created.
[03:26:15.797 --> 03:26:17.338]  Oh, in the health service sector.
[03:26:18.078 --> 03:26:19.259]  Oh, in hospitality.
[03:26:20.039 --> 03:26:20.779]  Oh, in government.
[03:26:21.630 --> 03:26:22.150]  Oh, government.
[03:26:22.530 --> 03:26:26.032]  You get people who can't get jobs in the real world that suck into the bureaucratic system.
[03:26:26.552 --> 03:26:35.596]  And they're low-paying jobs in service sector, the health service sector, and hospitality and services.
[03:26:36.176 --> 03:26:36.956]  Low-paying jobs.
[03:26:38.057 --> 03:26:50.002]  Then you gotta look at, and we do it every week in your Trends Journal, from McDonald's to Starbucks to Gucci up at the top.
[03:26:51.681 --> 03:26:53.362]  Again, the fish rots from the head down.
[03:26:54.203 --> 03:26:55.524]  Sales going way down.
[03:26:58.566 --> 03:27:08.934]  Bankssters across the globe are going to do everything they can to dump cheap money into the system to prop it up.
[03:27:10.315 --> 03:27:12.237]  Look at the riots going on.
[03:27:12.377 --> 03:27:15.159]  Well, we won't talk about it because nobody does, but we'll say it anyway.
[03:27:15.199 --> 03:27:16.060]  In Bangladesh.
[03:27:16.080 --> 03:27:17.061]  What's a Bangladesh?
[03:27:17.081 --> 03:27:18.822]  Well, it's six bangs and a dash.
[03:27:19.508 --> 03:27:20.388]  No, no.
[03:27:20.449 --> 03:27:24.371]  Bangladesh, Niger, Nigeria.
[03:27:25.411 --> 03:27:26.692]  One country after another.
[03:27:26.712 --> 03:27:29.593]  Kenya.
[03:27:30.934 --> 03:27:32.315]  People taking to the streets.
[03:27:34.856 --> 03:27:37.097]  The Prime Minister of Bangladesh just left.
[03:27:39.879 --> 03:27:41.279]  The New World Disorder.
[03:27:42.420 --> 03:27:44.721]  As people lack basic living standards.
[03:27:46.122 --> 03:27:47.122]  Government corruption.
[03:27:48.023 --> 03:27:48.483]  Crime.
[03:27:49.637 --> 03:27:50.238]  Violence.
[03:27:51.479 --> 03:27:53.660]  Oh, you think you got a migration problem now?
[03:27:54.701 --> 03:27:56.042]  You ain't seen anything yet.
[03:27:57.143 --> 03:28:05.569]  As more and more people do what they can to escape the poverty, the crime, the violence, and the government corruption.
[03:28:05.589 --> 03:28:10.013]  So you're going to see more of a populist movement, parties.
[03:28:10.970 --> 03:28:11.831]  And that's what we need.
[03:28:11.891 --> 03:28:13.392]  We need a new party in America.
[03:28:13.432 --> 03:28:17.034]  The same gang has been running with the demo craps and repulsive kids.
[03:28:17.334 --> 03:28:19.296]  Wow, how many hundred and how many years?
[03:28:21.597 --> 03:28:23.438]  How about somebody from the outside?
[03:28:25.079 --> 03:28:25.340]  Yeah.
[03:28:25.720 --> 03:28:28.702]  If I ran for president, bring home all the troops.
[03:28:29.843 --> 03:28:30.963]  Secure the homeland.
[03:28:32.644 --> 03:28:35.987]  Put the troops that work rebuilding our rotted infrastructure.
[03:28:36.007 --> 03:28:38.348]  No, I'm not an isolationist.
[03:28:38.949 --> 03:28:40.650]  All you clowns that want to go
[03:28:41.596 --> 03:28:43.958]  Support Israel, support Ukraine.
[03:28:44.298 --> 03:28:47.701]  Go over there, take your money, and go fight.
[03:28:49.082 --> 03:28:52.425]  And take your wife, your kids, and your transgenders.
[03:28:53.526 --> 03:28:54.446]  I'm an American.
[03:28:55.547 --> 03:28:57.109]  I believe in the Founding Fathers.
[03:28:58.189 --> 03:28:59.370]  George Washington.
[03:28:59.831 --> 03:29:02.273]  Become involved in no foreign entanglements.
[03:29:02.893 --> 03:29:05.655]  Basically, this crap has been going on for centuries.
[03:29:06.936 --> 03:29:11.160]  It's America first and only, as I see it.
[03:29:11.812 --> 03:29:13.621]  You only attack the attacker.
[03:29:14.164 --> 03:29:15.008]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:15.229 --> 03:29:16.274]  Support InfoWars!
[03:29:18.291 --> 03:29:25.734]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[03:29:26.374 --> 03:29:28.655]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[03:29:29.255 --> 03:29:35.777]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.
[03:29:35.797 --> 03:29:39.338]  And that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[03:29:39.819 --> 03:29:45.981]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison.
[03:29:46.901 --> 03:29:55.565]  To double down and support the broadcast more than ever, to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at infowarestore.com.
[03:29:55.766 --> 03:30:04.870]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[03:30:05.250 --> 03:30:06.351]  These are very, very popular.
[03:30:06.371 --> 03:30:07.471]  And I went looking up online.
[03:30:07.892 --> 03:30:08.812]  It is very, very popular.
[03:30:09.412 --> 03:30:10.333]  It's not an investment.
[03:30:10.533 --> 03:30:11.133]  It's a collectible.
[03:30:11.353 --> 03:30:14.355]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's
[03:30:14.815 --> 03:30:15.376]  We're good to go.
[03:30:38.323 --> 03:30:42.064]  Uh, to the folks, despite the fact we'd already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[03:30:42.365 --> 03:30:53.429]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[03:30:54.029 --> 03:31:02.431]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[03:31:02.911 --> 03:31:13.153]  Stock up on 24 karat .999 pure gold in the most popular size of one-tenth gram, an affordable sleek card that fits your wallet, drawer, glove compartment, and is easy to travel with.
[03:31:13.573 --> 03:31:15.053]  They're amazing cards.
[03:31:15.413 --> 03:31:17.213]  It's got original art I came up with.
[03:31:17.293 --> 03:31:19.674]  It's got the little bar of gold in there.
[03:31:20.214 --> 03:31:22.855]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Infowar.
[03:31:23.155 --> 03:31:29.198]  You'll have a historical memento as a keepsake for yourself, for your family, for your children, and your grandchildren.
[03:31:29.218 --> 03:31:30.858]  Because this is a historic fight.
[03:31:31.259 --> 03:31:35.080]  And this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[03:31:35.440 --> 03:31:36.741]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[03:31:37.401 --> 03:31:40.302]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[03:31:40.863 --> 03:31:43.864]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[03:31:44.224 --> 03:31:49.086]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[03:31:49.466 --> 03:31:51.547]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[03:31:52.348 --> 03:31:58.310]  We've only got a few thousand of these left, and I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[03:31:58.330 --> 03:31:58.951]  Now, I want to be clear.
[03:31:59.531 --> 03:32:01.712]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[03:32:01.732 --> 03:32:02.512]  That's not what this is.
[03:32:02.532 --> 03:32:03.553]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[03:32:04.153 --> 03:32:06.715]  This is like on NPR that still gets taxpayer money.
[03:32:06.735 --> 03:32:10.859]  They'll sell a coffee mug to cost them $5 or a baseball cap to cost them $10.
[03:32:11.900 --> 03:32:17.265]  And you make $100 donation and you get that as a memento that you supported communism in the new world order.
[03:32:17.545 --> 03:32:18.466]  I know you don't want to do that.
[03:32:19.186 --> 03:32:23.630]  This cost, I think they told me more than $10 per card, something like that, $10 or $11.
[03:32:23.711 --> 03:32:24.271]  And so the other
[03:32:26.493 --> 03:32:29.555]  80-something dollars will go to fund the operation.
[03:32:29.595 --> 03:32:32.738]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[03:32:33.258 --> 03:32:40.944]  So, get your collectible card, your piece of art, with a little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[03:32:41.324 --> 03:32:42.425]  The decision is yours.
[03:32:42.445 --> 03:32:43.846]  This is a limited edition.
[03:32:44.486 --> 03:32:48.810]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[03:32:49.510 --> 03:32:59.798]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, and myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[03:33:00.178 --> 03:33:09.065]  So please take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars limited edition proprietary 24 karat 999 pure gold collectible.
[03:33:09.466 --> 03:33:10.306]  Thank you for your support.
[03:33:10.687 --> 03:33:12.328]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[03:33:19.952 --> 03:33:24.054]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:33:24.575 --> 03:33:25.895]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:33:40.104 --> 03:33:43.025]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:43.546 --> 03:33:47.188]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente!
[03:34:01.422 --> 03:34:07.305]  We are at a very critical time in the history of the world, part one and part two.
[03:34:08.306 --> 03:34:14.229]  InfoWars is doing everything they can to give you the insights and observations that you need to know.
[03:34:15.610 --> 03:34:19.212]  And as Alex says, you know, you got all these millions of people watching.
[03:34:19.818 --> 03:34:26.740]  What percent really buy the products that keep InfoWars going and their staff that works so hard to make this happen.
[03:34:27.881 --> 03:34:32.622]  So they got these great bargains coming up, a real good sale, and it's the time of the year to get it.
[03:34:33.443 --> 03:34:38.024]  And you could go to InfoWars Store and you get your InfoWars MD.
[03:34:39.285 --> 03:34:43.586]  These again, these are premium supplement lines and it's discounted prices.
[03:34:44.526 --> 03:34:46.327]  You get it for 25% off.
[03:34:46.367 --> 03:34:48.968]  And again, you only get them at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:34:50.640 --> 03:34:54.043]  They got this Ageless Vitality Collagen.
[03:34:54.103 --> 03:34:56.264]  I got to get that one because I've got to be ageless here.
[03:34:56.905 --> 03:34:58.046]  Superfoods Green.
[03:34:58.866 --> 03:34:59.727]  Mushroom Max.
[03:35:00.288 --> 03:35:00.868]  Better Mood.
[03:35:01.769 --> 03:35:02.509]  Turmeric 95.
[03:35:02.709 --> 03:35:03.710]  A whole bunch of great stuff.
[03:35:03.790 --> 03:35:04.731]  Prostate Support.
[03:35:05.332 --> 03:35:06.833]  And boy, all those older cats.
[03:35:06.893 --> 03:35:08.914]  Boy, we need that prostate support.
[03:35:09.715 --> 03:35:10.396]  Really, you got to do it.
[03:35:10.456 --> 03:35:11.576]  Get in the best shape you can.
[03:35:11.636 --> 03:35:13.298]  Physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[03:35:13.678 --> 03:35:15.119]  And these products help you do it.
[03:35:15.540 --> 03:35:17.401]  They help you and they help InfoWars.
[03:35:17.921 --> 03:35:18.702]  Nerve Renew.
[03:35:18.822 --> 03:35:19.823]  Joint Max Relief.
[03:35:20.578 --> 03:35:26.860]  Good night's sleep and you need that good night's sleep when you got all this crap going on that makes you feel lousy.
[03:35:27.360 --> 03:35:31.081]  So grab the reins of your health and wellness with this premium lineup.
[03:35:31.741 --> 03:35:40.684]  Again, it's available at a rate that dominates the competition and you can get it only at InfoWarsStore.
[03:35:40.984 --> 03:35:42.524]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:35:44.025 --> 03:35:44.185]  So,
[03:35:46.471 --> 03:35:56.133]  As we're looking at the markets, as we took the break over here, what was the Dow here?
[03:35:56.213 --> 03:35:56.713]  Down 1,196.
[03:35:58.354 --> 03:36:02.895]  So it's down 120 points lower than when we first went on the air.
[03:36:05.035 --> 03:36:06.055]  This is just the beginning.
[03:36:06.135 --> 03:36:07.476]  Again, the game is rigged.
[03:36:08.016 --> 03:36:09.916]  And I want to make that 100% clear.
[03:36:10.576 --> 03:36:13.757]  I want to make that a million percent clear.
[03:36:16.701 --> 03:36:18.723]  Again, my track record is there.
[03:36:19.463 --> 03:36:22.525]  I'm the guy that called the 1987 stock market crash.
[03:36:22.745 --> 03:36:23.666]  That's how I made my name.
[03:36:25.728 --> 03:36:28.189]  I'm the guy that called the Asian currency crisis.
[03:36:30.211 --> 03:36:31.372]  Right here in your Trends Journal.
[03:36:33.893 --> 03:36:35.535]  I'm the guy that called the dot-com bust.
[03:36:38.497 --> 03:36:42.360]  I'm the guy that took out the domain name in 2007, the Panic of 08.
[03:36:47.978 --> 03:36:51.980]  In 2012, I said, this thing's going down big.
[03:36:53.500 --> 03:36:55.101]  People forget how bad it was back in 2012.
[03:36:55.221 --> 03:37:00.964]  I bought, you know, I own three of the most historic buildings in America.
[03:37:01.004 --> 03:37:04.225]  The only place with pre-revolutionary war stone buildings on each corner.
[03:37:05.886 --> 03:37:07.166]  And I bought them in 2012.
[03:37:07.447 --> 03:37:11.388]  I thought this thing was way down.
[03:37:11.408 --> 03:37:15.190]  I thought it was going to keep getting worse, but I bought them because of what they represent.
[03:37:16.049 --> 03:37:18.411]  I think I had like a mortgage rate of like 2.8%.
[03:37:20.592 --> 03:37:22.513]  I thought the markets were going to crash back then.
[03:37:23.214 --> 03:37:23.574]  They didn't.
[03:37:24.855 --> 03:37:41.246]  They didn't teach me about zero interest rate policy or quantitative easing in Economics 101 for graduate school.
[03:37:43.388 --> 03:37:45.329]  Look at all the dough
[03:37:45.848 --> 03:37:54.131]  That they pumped in when the markets went bust back in 2008.
[03:38:00.673 --> 03:38:03.614]  This is from a site that I recommend people go to.
[03:38:04.574 --> 03:38:06.034]  Wall Street on Parade.
[03:38:06.554 --> 03:38:07.695]  Ham and Russ Martins.
[03:38:08.475 --> 03:38:11.336]  They write more about the banksters than anybody else.
[03:38:14.164 --> 03:38:21.889]  Not helping matters this morning is the fact that the mega banks on Wall Street are continuing their sharp losses from last week.
[03:38:23.771 --> 03:38:26.653]  As of this morning, 9.37, when they put this out a.m.
[03:38:28.774 --> 03:38:31.116]  Citigroup is off by another 7.37%.
[03:38:31.156 --> 03:38:36.960]  Goldman Sachs is down almost 7%.
[03:38:38.401 --> 03:38:43.845]  Citigroup parent of the giant federally insured Citibank has now moved
[03:38:44.534 --> 03:38:53.780]  From a closing price of $64.30 last Monday to trading this morning at $54.20.
[03:38:54.801 --> 03:38:59.665]  A loss of 16% in a week.
[03:39:01.566 --> 03:39:08.811]  Veteran traders on Wall Street remember, and I remember this too and I'm not a veteran trader, we wrote about it as it was happening in the Trends Journal.
[03:39:09.727 --> 03:39:17.229]  That Citigroup was a mega bank that destabilized the market in 2008, requiring, you ready?
[03:39:17.969 --> 03:39:29.992]  A secret infusion of $2.5 trillion in revolving loans from the federal, from the Fed between December 2007 to July 2010.
[03:39:30.072 --> 03:39:30.792]  Secret infusion.
[03:39:40.680 --> 03:39:40.920]  Yeah.
[03:39:43.022 --> 03:39:45.003]  You're just a piece of crap.
[03:39:46.224 --> 03:39:49.046]  You get nothing when times are hard for you.
[03:39:49.846 --> 03:39:58.673]  But when the banksters who caused the crisis to happen, give them all the money you want and we do it in secret.
[03:39:59.473 --> 03:40:00.134]  You got it?
[03:40:01.875 --> 03:40:03.296]  It's a crime syndicate.
[03:40:04.637 --> 03:40:07.399]  Now I can see I can find this Transgeneral Covey here.
[03:40:07.439 --> 03:40:07.899]  Here it is.
[03:40:08.219 --> 03:40:08.399]  Yeah.
[03:40:09.020 --> 03:40:09.280]  Here we go.
[03:40:13.086 --> 03:40:13.746]  Look familiar?
[03:40:13.766 --> 03:40:17.087]  I assume you're Trans Journal back in, what, 2007.
[03:40:22.249 --> 03:40:25.230]  Jesus Christ driving the money changers out of the temple.
[03:40:31.432 --> 03:40:25.230]  2012.
[03:40:31.712 --> 03:40:33.292]  Yep.
[03:40:35.693 --> 03:40:36.713]  That's who's running the show.
[03:40:38.134 --> 03:40:39.514]  It's an out-and-out crime syndicate.
[03:40:43.453 --> 03:40:46.035]  So now you're looking at the markets going way down here.
[03:40:46.215 --> 03:40:48.697]  They're going to do everything they can to pump it up, as I said.
[03:40:48.717 --> 03:40:51.859]  And again, we call it like it is.
[03:40:52.919 --> 03:40:55.561]  If the markets go down, if there's a crash.
[03:40:57.783 --> 03:40:57.963]  Yep.
[03:40:59.404 --> 03:41:01.625]  Again, the Prince of Peace became violent.
[03:41:03.106 --> 03:41:10.631]  Because of, and as Thomas Aquinas said, if you're not angry when it's justifiable to be angry, you're immoral.
[03:41:11.352 --> 03:41:13.273]  It's morally just to be angry.
[03:41:16.144 --> 03:41:19.186]  When immoral deeds are being done.
[03:41:20.547 --> 03:41:21.368]  So going back.
[03:41:22.869 --> 03:41:24.671]  You know, which this is going to be.
[03:41:24.691 --> 03:41:27.573]  They're going to lower interest rates.
[03:41:27.813 --> 03:41:28.454]  They have to.
[03:41:29.214 --> 03:41:30.215]  But if they don't.
[03:41:30.955 --> 03:41:31.296]  Again.
[03:41:32.236 --> 03:41:35.239]  We said Harris will beat Trump in the race of the White House.
[03:41:36.139 --> 03:41:37.621]  Minus a wild card.
[03:41:38.301 --> 03:41:40.343]  Such as a stock market crash.
[03:41:41.363 --> 03:41:42.524]  The markets go down.
[03:41:42.624 --> 03:41:43.605]  Trump goes way up.
[03:41:45.407 --> 03:41:45.707]  Again.
[03:41:47.421 --> 03:41:48.962]  We write the facts.
[03:41:50.463 --> 03:41:55.466]  This is from our 17 May 2022 Trends Journal.
[03:41:57.007 --> 03:42:08.415]  Harris has aspirations to be President of the United States, and she knows that her boss is an unpopular president who is 79 years old.
[03:42:10.376 --> 03:42:15.440]  Being that Biden administration is viewed as ineffective in bringing down inflation,
[03:42:15.922 --> 03:42:18.124]  And strongly boosting the economy.
[03:42:19.925 --> 03:42:24.389]  All right, they failed on the economy and everyone knows it and feels it.
[03:42:25.290 --> 03:42:26.711]  And this is so important.
[03:42:31.975 --> 03:42:37.900]  The people realize how bad it all is when the equity markets crash.
[03:42:39.621 --> 03:42:40.722]  That's when it hits.
[03:42:41.963 --> 03:42:45.606]  Now, that's going to be very positive for Trump.
[03:42:46.178 --> 03:42:48.259]  I was talking about the banks before.
[03:42:49.199 --> 03:43:03.465]  Only in your Trends Journal, nowhere else in the world, I gave you some of the data of the loss of stock market value for the banksters as this thing is going down.
[03:43:05.125 --> 03:43:05.866]  It's just begun.
[03:43:07.006 --> 03:43:11.708]  No one's talking about the office building bust where there's going to be massive defaults
[03:43:12.862 --> 03:43:22.649]  Oh, there was just one, what, in New York, a building on 50th Street, Midtown Manhattan, that sold for, what, $320 million in 2006?
[03:43:25.671 --> 03:43:33.717]  Just went up for auction last week, and they bought it for $8.5 million, down more than 97% of its value.
[03:43:34.698 --> 03:43:36.099]  The banks are gonna go bust.
[03:43:39.181 --> 03:43:40.181]  It has just begun.
[03:43:41.402 --> 03:43:42.303]  But don't worry about it.
[03:43:42.827 --> 03:43:44.648]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:43:44.668 --> 03:43:48.011]  And we'll all get our brains blown out with nuclear annihilation.
[03:43:48.131 --> 03:43:48.992]  Everything will be fine.
[03:43:49.853 --> 03:43:54.536]  Don't forget, you know, build a tunnel so you can escape it and put your head under the desk.
[03:43:54.796 --> 03:43:54.997]  Yeah.
[03:43:56.137 --> 03:43:56.738]  Support us.
[03:43:57.479 --> 03:44:00.061]  September 28th, a rally up here in Kingston.
[03:44:00.081 --> 03:44:01.762]  Go to OccupyPeace.com.
[03:44:02.382 --> 03:44:03.984]  I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[03:44:04.764 --> 03:44:05.485]  Thanks for tuning in.
[03:44:16.368 --> 03:44:24.411]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements.
[03:44:25.391 --> 03:44:29.153]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[03:44:29.613 --> 03:44:31.794]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[03:44:32.634 --> 03:44:38.056]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[03:44:39.122 --> 03:44:47.684]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[03:44:48.024 --> 03:44:49.885]  We had five companies making product for us.
[03:44:50.505 --> 03:44:55.006]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and your info wars.
[03:44:55.726 --> 03:45:01.408]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[03:45:01.788 --> 03:45:04.288]  Not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[03:45:05.108 --> 03:45:06.609]  And they said, listen, you know
[03:45:07.847 --> 03:45:23.834]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[03:45:24.234 --> 03:45:30.897]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[03:45:31.980 --> 03:45:33.283]  We're good to go.
[03:45:43.883 --> 03:45:51.987]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private-labeled from them before we were even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[03:45:52.067 --> 03:45:58.690]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[03:45:58.870 --> 03:46:01.351]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[03:46:01.511 --> 03:46:03.432]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[03:46:03.632 --> 03:46:13.420]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[03:46:14.041 --> 03:46:16.443]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[03:46:16.503 --> 03:46:17.544]  Take Turmeric 95.
[03:46:19.225 --> 03:46:25.947]  Turmeric 95 isn't called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[03:46:26.047 --> 03:46:31.709]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[03:46:31.809 --> 03:46:40.351]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[03:46:40.391 --> 03:46:42.452]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[03:46:44.099 --> 03:46:57.391]  Because of the bankruptcy, attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[03:46:57.871 --> 03:47:02.275]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[03:47:02.335 --> 03:47:06.979]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[03:47:07.279 --> 03:47:10.720]  At InfoWarsStore.com from InfoWarsMD.
[03:47:10.860 --> 03:47:13.220]  So, I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[03:47:13.320 --> 03:47:13.920]  It's amazing.
[03:47:14.060 --> 03:47:14.981]  It's super high quality.
[03:47:15.041 --> 03:47:16.901]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[03:47:17.021 --> 03:47:17.701]  Nitric Boost.
[03:47:17.861 --> 03:47:18.561]  Good night's sleep.
[03:47:18.801 --> 03:47:20.322]  Joint Relief Max is amazing.
[03:47:20.442 --> 03:47:20.942]  Nerve Renew.
[03:47:20.962 --> 03:47:21.722]  Prostate Support.
[03:47:21.782 --> 03:47:22.802]  Probiotic Formula.
[03:47:22.922 --> 03:47:24.442]  CBD Full Spectrum.
[03:47:24.723 --> 03:47:25.823]  25 milligram gummies.
[03:47:25.943 --> 03:47:27.103]  CBD Full Spectrum.
[03:47:27.343 --> 03:47:28.143]  10 milligram gummies.
[03:47:28.183 --> 03:47:28.743]  Works great.
[03:47:28.783 --> 03:47:29.784]  Turmeric 95.
[03:47:29.944 --> 03:47:31.084]  Libido RX.
[03:47:31.244 --> 03:47:31.884]  Better Mood.
[03:47:32.024 --> 03:47:35.445]  Mushroom Max for mental clarity and your immune system.
[03:47:35.585 --> 03:47:36.545]  Superfood Greens.
[03:47:36.705 --> 03:47:37.005]  Ageless
[03:47:37.205 --> 03:47:37.686]  Thank you.
