[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.220]  All of my points of contact, my email, my phone, family, the crew, people on the street, have just been blowing up in the last 48 hours asking me, what is the future of InfoWars?
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.820]  What is really going on?
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.259]  What is really happening?
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.559]  And I will succinctly break that down in just a moment.
[00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:27.329]  But first, I wanted to take some time out to talk about the game changer in the last few years, not just here in America, but around the world for freedom.
[00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.250]  Now, obviously, we're talking about Donald Trump.
[00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:49.009]  But in this particular case, I'm talking about Elon Musk, the only individual that's done more to expose tyranny and promote liberty and team humanity in my lifetime Who even begins to rival President Trump is Elon Musk.
[00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.710]  It is the dynamic duo.
[00:00:51.170 --> 00:01:03.770]  And everything he's done the last two years has been devastating to tyrants and corrupt institutions and has been fabulously positive for freedom in the average person.
[00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:22.310]  So I wanted to take a moment out to thank Elon Musk for all he's done And to specifically point out that he sent his lawyers last Thursday afternoon to Houston in my corporate bankruptcy case and they have appeared officially in the case and have requested all the data,
[00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:29.790]  all the files and all the information so they can review it and find out for themselves exactly what is going on.
[00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.390]  Now people have asked me Why did Elon do that?
[00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:34.890]  And I know the answer.
[00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:44.549]  It's because it's in his own self-interest at X not to allow them to do what they've been trying the last few months in my case.
[00:01:44.709 --> 00:02:01.109]  They have literally claimed in federal filings, the Democrats, using these plaintiffs as their front group, that they own the name Alex Jones and that they own the name real Alex Jones on X. They actually put in the filing that the 13th Amendment does not apply to Alex Jones.
[00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.920]  The We're good to go.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.439]  Because that's slavery.
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:28.060]  Well, they are literally trying to overturn not just your property rights, but your very right to your name.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:41.610]  And so now The Onion, with this big Democrat Soros gun control group funding it, that's really who did this, They admitted it on Good Morning America Friday, came in here and supposedly won the auction, which never even happened.
[00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:42.370]  I'll get to that in a moment.
[00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:53.909]  And are saying they want to take my identity and have Infowars.com and use the archive of my work to edit it and to distort it and to...
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.120]  Ridicule me and quote, discredit me.
[00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:58.840]  And they admit they didn't want money.
[00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.159]  The plaintiffs, they wanted to take me off the air in these filings as well.
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:12.479]  I ask that with your verdict, you not only take Alex Jones platform that he talks about away.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.620]  I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild the platform.
[00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.099]  That's what matters.
[00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:31.349]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.969]  That is punishment.
[00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.229]  That is deterrence.
[00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.229]  And the question is going to be, where is Alice Jones when that happens?
[00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.610]  Is he in the studio?
[00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.949]  Getting ready to bounce?
[00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:02.009]  And that is why I've been saying that what this is heading towards is there's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of Infowars in the bankruptcy estate.
[00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.810]  And over the course of that process, that could get very, very dangerous for Mr.
[00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:06.110]  Jones.
[00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.069]  But we will be at it as long as it takes.
[00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:20.910]  And if you're out there right now and you're one of Alex Jones' audience members and you're considering giving him money, I just want you to know that based on the jury's verdict today, it's not a very good bet.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.240]  I hope that we never see someone like Him again.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.779]  I hope that with your verdict, He can go away.
[00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:34.850]  But the money is not even really the question for me.
[00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:40.110]  The question is, will this suit be successful at stopping him from being on the national stage?
[00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.589]  You don't get that under federal law.
[00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:47.610]  You can get money in a judgment, but you don't get to try to destroy somebody's livelihood.
[00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.269]  You don't get to try to destroy somebody's name.
[00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:52.550]  So ladies and gentlemen, this is a big deal.
[00:04:52.730 --> 00:05:00.660]  And when I talk about Musk doing this out of self-interest, All freedom comes from self-interest when you understand history and common sense and human nature.
[00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.300]  Musk has said if one person doesn't have freedom of speech, it'll end up being everybody.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.899]  So when I want freedom, it's out of self-interest.
[00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:09.579]  Yes, I want you to be free as well.
[00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.740]  If I don't have freedom, you're going to end up not having freedom.
[00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:19.620]  And so Elon Musk understands these basic fundamentals that more people need to understand.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:32.050]  They used me, before they even banned Trump off of Twitter, Five years ago or so, to set the precedent to be able to take anybody off, and they admitted that.
[00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.129]  And to do that, they demonized me.
[00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.069]  They lied about me.
[00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:40.790]  They created these straw man things that I never did and promoted all over the media for years.
[00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.589]  Then they had show trials with the judges that already found me guilty, had HBO produce it.
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.800]  And then found me liable for $1.5 billion.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.180]  So I was guilty until proven how guilty.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.819]  Not innocent until proven guilty.
[00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:56.519]  Not guilty until proven innocent.
[00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:59.500]  But guilty until proven how guilty.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.720]  This is all being done strategically.
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.879]  It's all lawfare.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.439]  It's total tyranny.
[00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:08.519]  It's all part of the new global social credit score.
[00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:15.920]  Where the big banks admit in the future, if you're not a good little globalist, you won't just not be able to have a car or get on a plane or a bus or go to the grocery store.
[00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:17.660]  It's not just that your credit card won't work.
[00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:23.839]  It's that you yourself will literally have your identity taken by the system.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.839]  So this is all being done very strategically.
[00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:30.019]  Demonize a minority or an individual.
[00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:37.819]  Get everybody to agree that those people don't have rights, like Hitler and the Jews and many other examples, the Russian communists and the Kulaks.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:45.399]  And then once you've set the precedent to take their rights away, you take everybody else's rights away.
[00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:50.040]  And so Elon Musk is a champion in the real world.
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.040]  He's always been a maverick at everything he's done.
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:07:00.519]  And now he's taken that action of being a trailblazer for human liberty to levels never before seen.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.959]  And without him, We wouldn't have overridden the massive election fraud, and we wouldn't have been able to get President Trump in.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:19.339]  And now, day one after the victory, he turned his attention to Big Pharma and Fauci and their crimes against humanity, and his attention to stopping World War III. Elon Musk, hands down, is a hero.
[00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:23.740]  And for people out there saying, oh, he's powerful, he's rich, we can't trust him.
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.620]  Christ said you judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:29.060]  And the fruits of Elon Musk are...
[00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:41.230]  It's overwhelmingly incredible when it comes to fighting tyranny and waking people up and providing a platform for billions of people to share information openly and freely.
[00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.329]  So I am a defender of Elon Musk.
[00:07:43.769 --> 00:07:45.589]  I am a booster of Elon Musk.
[00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.810]  I am an extreme supporter of Elon Musk.
[00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:54.430]  And I want to thank him for his courage, his will, and his vision.
[00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.449]  And I also want to thank all of you.
[00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:01.560]  Now, briefly recapping what's happened with my bankruptcy case.
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:13.139]  Just in May 31st of this year, the last federal appointed trustee ordered the building shut with private security with no court order.
[00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:13.779]  And I said, I'm not leaving.
[00:08:13.819 --> 00:08:14.379]  I'm calling the police.
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.079]  And people didn't believe it.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.980]  It sounded so tyrannical.
[00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:17.800]  Oh, that couldn't have happened.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.899]  And then two weeks later, they had the emergency hearing, and the judge said, not only is he not kicked out, you're fired.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.319]  This is crazy.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.699]  The new trustee came in, acted friendly for the last...
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:35.139]  We're good to go.
[00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:38.799]  We're good to go.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.019]  So there was not an auction.
[00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:57.899]  The judge said this is not an auction.
[00:08:58.039 --> 00:08:58.840]  That's in the transcript.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.639]  And that's why they seized the building and turned the Internet off Thursday morning.
[00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:12.799]  And then we were back in Friday morning because they finally woke up and went, oh, my God, we literally hijacked someone's building.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.179]  I still own it.
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.340]  Well, here we are back at the Infowars studios.
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.899]  I thought it was bought by The Onion.
[00:09:19.149 --> 00:09:20.090]  I heard they bought it.
[00:09:20.169 --> 00:09:21.330]  I heard they got it at an auction.
[00:09:21.429 --> 00:09:23.250]  Turned out it was a rigged auction.
[00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.570]  Turned out the judge didn't authorize that auction.
[00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.350]  This is like robbing a bank and figuring out you did it and then trying to take the money back.
[00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:30.610]  You already robbed the bank.
[00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.029]  Doesn't matter you bring the money back the next day.
[00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.690]  So, people find this hard to believe because it's so crazy.
[00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.549]  I, like, basically hear Twilight Zone music all the time myself, okay?
[00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:50.330]  But now you see the headlines, and ooh, judge angry, judge says auction didn't happen, you know, judge says everybody should be very concerned about how this was done, and he's gonna have a full investigation.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.980]  Now you've got former Deputy Attorney General under Trump saying there needs to be a criminal investigation.
[00:09:56.259 --> 00:09:59.159]  And the word is the wheels are going very, very quickly on that.
[00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:01.200]  Like I told you before, it even hit the news.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.580]  Elon Musk is getting involved.
[00:10:02.799 --> 00:10:03.399]  That's confirmed.
[00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:05.500]  So yeah, truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:07.340]  We're in the middle of it right now.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:16.139]  I'm not sure what's going to happen now, but I can't imagine this judge is known as fair and known for having courage to do the right thing.
[00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.990]  And so these folks, I think, are in for a very, very rude awakening.
[00:10:20.149 --> 00:10:27.769]  And from the documents we've gotten from the auction after the fact, it's clear-cut what it is.
[00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:29.029]  And I'm not going to say what it is.
[00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:34.389]  I'm just going to wait until you see what it is, and you are going to be blown away.
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:42.399]  It's like these cases where people commit something, and then they videotape it, and people are like, why did they videotape themselves doing it?
[00:10:42.519 --> 00:10:43.840]  Why did they record it?
[00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:51.120]  I guess they think if they create a record of it, that it would somehow make it okay.
[00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:55.320]  I mean, they're on TV going, well, he doesn't get his rights, so he's Alex Jones.
[00:10:57.169 --> 00:11:05.190]  Overnight, the judge in charge of this put a hold on your purchase, raising questions about the process, raising questions about transparency in the bidding process.
[00:11:05.409 --> 00:11:06.250]  What do you make of that?
[00:11:06.309 --> 00:11:07.769]  Are you confident this is still going to go through?
[00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:09.029]  Yeah, look, we won the bid.
[00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.610]  We own Inforas, and we are very excited about that.
[00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:13.830]  But is it true that you didn't have the highest bid?
[00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:19.850]  We did have the highest bid when you take into account the family's concessions here.
[00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:25.669]  They made a concerted effort to make this the best and highest bid for everybody involved.
[00:11:26.309 --> 00:11:28.549]  So we're very excited to take that over.
[00:11:28.649 --> 00:11:30.450]  And look, it's Alex Jones.
[00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:36.470]  If he just handled this graciously and moved away, that would be the funniest part of this whole situation.
[00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:39.409]  Obviously that is not something that he's going to do in this situation.
[00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.970]  So you're confident this is going to go through?
[00:11:41.149 --> 00:11:41.409]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:44.440]  I think that's what it is, but I don't understand the psychology.
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.000]  But this is crazy.
[00:11:46.929 --> 00:11:48.009]  So thank you, Elon Musk.
[00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:48.669]  Thank you, America.
[00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.929]  Thank you for the world.
[00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.690]  I'm going to be on today, this Sunday, 4 to 8 p.m.
[00:11:52.769 --> 00:11:54.330]  at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:11:54.529 --> 00:11:56.129]  Band out video here out of our studios.
[00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:03.090]  You can follow us on our backup channel in case something bad happens at AJNLive for the Alex Jones Network Live at AJNLive.
[00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.690]  Obviously, Real Alex Jones on X, radio stations across the country.
[00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.909]  Please support our sponsor to keep us on air.
[00:12:08.029 --> 00:12:09.190]  It takes money to fight these legal battles.
[00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:10.870]  Great supplements, great patriot gear.
[00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:12.309]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:13.509]  My dad's great supplement company.
[00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.029]  DRJonesNaturals.com.
[00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.950]  We're backed by...
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.039]  The people.
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.799]  Not backed by the establishment.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.879]  Until now, I guess the new establishment we take America back is Elon Musk.
[00:12:23.019 --> 00:12:27.139]  But he's coming to the case to obviously defend his rights and your rights at the same time.
[00:12:27.299 --> 00:12:28.860]  So hopefully the cavalry's here.
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:35.720]  But for now, every bit of money we've got coming in to support the operation is from average folks like you and I. So thanks for your support.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.779]  History's happening.
[00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:37.980]  I'll never give in.
[00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:38.759]  I'll never back down.
[00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:39.740]  I'll never sell out.
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:40.299]  It's impossible.
[00:12:40.419 --> 00:12:42.259]  It's not in my DNA. But I could give out.
[00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:44.639]  But so far, you have kept me in the fight.
[00:12:44.659 --> 00:12:46.159]  And I just want to thank you for that.
[00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.549]  Because we're having such victories against these people and it's so important for our children's future.
[00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.389]  Thank you so much to all of you and again to President Trump and Elon Musk.
[00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.870]  Thank you.
[00:12:55.070 --> 00:13:00.710]  We are unified by our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[00:13:01.029 --> 00:13:05.490]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of intervention.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:12.399]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.639]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[00:13:15.759 --> 00:13:18.240]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:21.259]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.960]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:32.340]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the new world order and BlackRock.
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.940]  They've declared war on us and we accept the challenge.
[00:13:41.009 --> 00:13:44.769]  AlexJones.network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.909]  Infowars can be shut down in just a few weeks.
[00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:55.610]  But regardless, the fight continues at AJNLive on X, the Alex Jones Network.
[00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:59.490]  If the globalists think they're going to shut us down, they've got another thing coming.
[00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.970]  The Second American Revolution continues on at AJNLive.
[00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:08.389]  Follow me there now for news updates and critical intel as we restore our republic.
[00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:19.309]  I respectfully ask you to pay attention to what I'm about to say because it is critical in three important ways.
[00:14:19.549 --> 00:14:21.909]  It'll keep my broadcast on the air.
[00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:34.590]  It will get you the highest quality, amazing CBD that's so good for your whole body, inflammation, joints, you name it, and you're getting the best deal you're going to find anywhere.
[00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.830]  I've been promoting and selling CBD for more than 20 years.
[00:14:38.009 --> 00:14:42.269]  Everybody knows how amazing it is, but not all CBD is equal.
[00:14:42.809 --> 00:14:55.649]  This is a high-quality, made-in-Texas, very strong CBD, thousand-milligram tincture that has been put in nanoparticles, so it's eight to nine times stronger than regular CBD that already gives you great effects.
[00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:06.190]  On top of that, we private label it from a top company that sells it to a bunch of other companies that sell it from between $140 to $90 to $76.
[00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:13.110]  This is the lowest price you're going to find on CBD of this quality anywhere in the market.
[00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.090]  The industry just massively marks it up.
[00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:24.370]  There's still some good margin in here for our sponsor to support their operation and support us, and then that savings is passed on to you.
[00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:31.190]  So if you want to get great CBD and keep the broadcast on air, visit jonescbd.com.
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.700]  Let me tell you the names of these products.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.139]  Ultra Green, because it's amazing, and Dreamwave.
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.559]  You want to get both of these and it supports the broadcast.
[00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:53.360]  You will not be disappointed, particularly if you're already into CBD and you take this that costs a third or half of what you're paying and you get a great response.
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.539]  I know you're gonna love it.
[00:15:54.679 --> 00:15:59.019]  That's what I'm looking for is repeat customers for our sponsor, jonescbd.com.
[00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:00.120]  Thanks for your support.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.159]  This is the best deal out there and it funds the fight against tyranny, a total 360 win.
[00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:08.700]  Visit jonescbd.com today and I think of your support.
