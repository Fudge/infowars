[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960]  The World Health Organization pandemic treaty is still not approved.
[00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:12.640]  And we're hearing almost nothing from WHO and Tedros.
[00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.140]  And I would expect that we would, except there was an election.
[00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:28.149]  And that election has brought into power a group that is not aligned with this kind of psychological manipulation in every way, the censorship, etc.
[00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:47.530]  So I think what we're seeing right now, and if you listen to the Lena Wynn quote clip that's been circulating from Face the Nation, she's advocating that this current administration needs to rush to deploy this product before the new administration comes in in three weeks.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:01:02.320]  And to rush out diagnostic tests because it's unlikely they're going to be able to jam this through the population once President-elect Trump is confirmed, is sworn in.
[00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:20.859]  I think there's a good chance that we're going to see a lot more of this over the next couple of weeks, and then it's going to suddenly get quenched once President Trump gets sworn in, and hopefully RFK Jr. gets confirmed in the Senate.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:43.319]  Alexander Kozmanov, who is a former Soviet KGB agent that specialized in biowarfare and the associated psychology.
[00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:50.799]  And he lays out a basically straightforward set of spycraft techniques.
[00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:58.760]  That are used to generate this, what he calls information bioterrorism, I call psychological bioterrorism.
[00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:15.960]  And if you go through what he describes as the standard spycraft for disrupting economies, fragmenting populations, causing economic disruption,
[00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:25.639]  etc., Using fear of infectious disease, this promoted fear, which is what we're absolutely seeing right now with bird flu.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.939]  And we saw before with monkeypox.
[00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:32.060]  It was what was played out in COVID. We see it again and again.
[00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:49.169]  If you go through those steps, you'll observe, and we talk about it in the book, I've talked about it in the substack, laid out what this spycraft is, you'll see that it's exactly parallel to what we're seeing deployed currently and what we've seen in these other cases.
[00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.289]  So is this a PSYOP? It absolutely is.
[00:02:52.409 --> 00:03:00.530]  The thing is that this kind of PSYOP or psychological warfare or fifth-generation warfare is a kissing cousin to marketing.
[00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:19.789]  And my sense is that not only is this being deployed by the US government, particularly the intelligence community, together with the defense community, because we now know that NATO has played a big role in what happened with COVID. But it's also now been adopted by the pharmaceutical industry as part of their marketing technology.
[00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:28.310]  And so that's what's getting laid down on us by the likes of Lena One and all of her associates.
[00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:40.729]  And if you listen to what they're saying, it's exactly the messaging that they laid down early on with COVID, except they've switched out for a different infectious disease.
[00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:47.789]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:13.550]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:44.240]  It's Tuesday, December 31st, 2024. The final day of this incredible revolutionary year against tyranny worldwide, where forces of Humans that want prosperity and want justice and want transparency and want free market competitive capitalist systems and who believe in a
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:05:01.360]  pro-human destiny came together not just in the United States but all over the world and began overthrowing The globalist systems and not just removing the political operatives of the WEF and the UN and Bill Gates, but actually a global awakening to the death cult.
[00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:05.939]  They really are a anti-human post-industrial eugenics organization.
[00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:17.350]  Now, they're trying to counter us as they planned decades ago to do in their own documents by using the fear of viruses to bring in their tyrannical one world government.
[00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:19.589]  But it's backfiring very, very quickly.
[00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.189]  There have been massive developments concerning the attempted launch of their new Plandemic Hysteria.
[00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:35.680]  Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA technologies coming up later on the broadcast today to lay out the facts of how this is a fake psychological warfare operation.
[00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:41.300]  Dr. Peter McCullough has come out with the documents and it's spreading everywhere right now.
[00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:49.920]  One of the top stories on X. And even hitting mainstream news that the new H5N1 was cooked up in US laboratories.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.279]  They didn't even cover up the origin of it.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.980]  How incredible is that?
[00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:58.639]  So right as they're launching it, it's already blowing up in the globalist's face.
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.819]  That and so much more is coming up today.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.920]  They tried to pass two weeks ago.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:12.720]  The funding for the current hysteria they're launching and that totally failed because you're awake, you're engaged, you're involved.
[00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:13.759]  We've turned the tide.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.639]  I'm about to break it all down right now.
[00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:24.370]  You know, bird flu or H5N1 influenza has been around for over 100 years, well documented in the scientific literature in the United States.
[00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:49.300]  The most recent outbreak, which is now four years old, we've published, McCullough Foundation has published with first author Nick Holscher, an epidemiologist in the journal Poultry, Fisheries, and Wildlife Sciences, peer-reviewed journal, that the current strain of bird flu It is a product of gain-of-function research done in the USDA Poultry Research Laboratory in Athens,
[00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:49.899]  Georgia.
[00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:55.759]  So it is a man-made problem that our farms are experiencing right now.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:08.660]  It's in the peer-reviewed literature and it's really, you know, the next steps in this outbreak is for people to understand, you know, the ramifications of it personally and how to be prepared.
[00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:09.889]  It is.
[00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:25.350]  The circulating clade, which is kind of the original source strain, is clade 2344B. And again, that is a product of what's called serial passage gain-of-function research done at the USDA Poultry Research Laboratory.
[00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:32.189]  It was assisted by University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine and Rotterdam University.
[00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:40.589]  The gain of function was to get it to spread from chickens into migratory waterfowl or mallard ducks.
[00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.470]  And so that's how it's spreading across the world now.
[00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.810]  It's been spreading for four years.
[00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:55.730]  It continually reinfects the farms because the mallard ducks fly around and they land in ponds on farms and they easily infect the other animals on the farm.
[00:07:55.730 --> 00:08:01.540]  So it was able to In a sense, expand the host range, even into cattle and to sea mammals.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:08.000]  Now, the good news is it's much milder than bird flu of decades ago.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.259]  And there's the peer-reviewed paper by Nick Kolsher on this.
[00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:17.339]  And this has not been denied by the USDA Poultry Research Center.
[00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:25.709]  McCullough Foundation attended the bird flu summits in both University of Arkansas as well as in Washington, DC. So there's no denial of this.
[00:08:25.829 --> 00:08:33.870]  Just like COVID-19, the bird flu problem is a man-made problem by the U.S. government.
[00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.529]  Out of the gates, they're trying to launch this new pandemic.
[00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:44.870]  And we already know that it was manmade and even where it was made in US bio labs in the name of bio defense.
[00:08:45.309 --> 00:08:51.950]  It's all part of a larger psyop, but if you're aware of the psyop, it doesn't work on the population and backfires on those that launched it.
[00:08:52.070 --> 00:09:07.440]  So on this historic December 31st, 2024 transmission, the last day of this incredible year of the populist uprising against the globalists worldwide, Let me just restate some key facts here, all right?
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.320]  I know almost all of you already understand this, but I want people to see this in its totality, then we're gonna walk through it.
[00:09:13.299 --> 00:09:24.519]  They tried to pass a spending bill two weeks ago that would give them all this unconstitutional martial law, medical tyranny, powers, and the funding, that failed.
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:32.419]  But they already had the PSYOP rolling out that Tedros, the WHO, and Dr. Hotez and others a month ago were bragging about.
[00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:35.799]  Don't worry, we're gonna maintain our control over the world.
[00:09:36.019 --> 00:09:42.460]  There's gonna be a new pandemic or pandemics and there's a secret disease in the Congo killing everybody with blood coming out of their eyes.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.120]  Turned out that was all a lie.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:44.919]  It was malaria.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.399]  They tried mpox and monkeypox.
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.059]  It was just changing the name the last few years.
[00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:52.940]  Nothing is working because the vast majority of people see through it.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.960]  They're only getting a two to 4% uptake on their new COVID shots.
[00:09:57.279 --> 00:10:00.879]  So they tried to use their disease X for total control and it backfired.
[00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:03.440]  So their big funding operation just failed.
[00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:08.220]  Now it's coming out that the bird flu current strain is man-made by the US government.
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.320]  Again, top scientists and experts are pointing out it's all a giant psyop.
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:18.960]  They're now admitting these so-called vaccines that they've got actually will cause leaky vaccine and cause deadly virus mutations.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.080]  Everything's blowing up in their face as they try to launch this new operation.
[00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:25.860]  That's why this is so important, but they got tricks up their sleeve.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.000]  Now I want to be very, very clear.
[00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:32.899]  Yes, it's good news that most people are not buying any of this garbage.
[00:10:34.039 --> 00:10:40.259]  And it's good news that it's coming out day one, that it's manmade, and of course, connected to our criminal federal government.
[00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:54.259]  And yes, it's great news that even mainline scientists are saying, how can you have a bunch of different companies with a bird flu vaccine that doesn't even cover some magic mutation we're not sure is even coming?
[00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:59.330]  And then give people a shot that won't even protect them from that.
[00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:03.490]  None of this even makes sense on its face, but it's not meant to.
[00:11:03.649 --> 00:11:06.269]  It's, again, a giant psyop.
[00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:27.179]  And what Dr. Peter McCullough and others have broken down, and we've shown these graphics, we'll show them again, and we posted them on Infowars.com and at Real Alex Jones on X, you can check it for yourself, is they have the history of these mutations, and we know that that was being researched at these labs, and then virologists were able to look at that and see that it's clearly been accelerated In its evolution.
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:40.120]  And then if you give people these experimental shots while the wild viruses are out there, it will cause them to have more accelerated evolution or the popular parlance leaky vaccine.
[00:11:40.419 --> 00:11:42.740]  So this is the worst thing they could do.
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:55.840]  Even if they weren't the ones that made this new H1N1 that they're now sitting back saying is about to jump into humans in a really bad way because they've got the next version clearly on the shelf, which they admit they have.
[00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:58.480]  I mean, these people aren't even hiding the stuff.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.399]  And if they don't start going to prison, they're going to release something far worse on us.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.220]  So let's recap.
[00:12:05.789 --> 00:12:07.429]  We've shot down their funding for this.
[00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:09.309]  We've shot down their global UN treaty.
[00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:18.370]  You've had their spokespersons like Tedros and Burks and Hotez running around saying, don't worry, a new pandemic's coming.
[00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:20.429]  That's how we'll keep control.
[00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:22.090]  It's going to come crashing in on Trump.
[00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:30.429]  They don't even hide the fact to their political minions that, hey, they're doing this for political power and, hey, wear the mask and keep America shut down.
[00:12:31.259 --> 00:12:40.500]  And that's a huge takeaway that the left, a lot of them are actually conscious of this and love the cult's power and enjoy being abused by it because they have Mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:12:40.899 --> 00:12:56.320]  Then you've got the fact that these new variants are clearly man-made of H5N1. Then you've got them wanting to give people all these new experimental shots they've got that don't even protect you but will mutate the wild virus on record to make it way worse.
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.240]  And then you've got all this coming out and the whole world seeing it.
[00:13:00.889 --> 00:13:03.409]  And Bill Gates running around saying, don't worry, a new virus is coming.
[00:13:03.529 --> 00:13:04.549]  It's going to kill a bunch of kids.
[00:13:04.669 --> 00:13:05.830]  So you better do what we say.
[00:13:06.009 --> 00:13:13.110]  I mean, they're openly got a gun to our head saying we're going to basically shut down society and kill you if you don't submit to us.
[00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:15.450]  But even if you submit to us, we're still going to do it anyway.
[00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:16.490]  So they give us no choice.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.379]  So this is an epic moment.
[00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:19.100]  We are winning.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.279]  But I just sit back and think, what are they gonna do now?
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.159]  And we still haven't defeated this yet.
[00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:26.720]  They're trying to roll it out.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.240]  It's not working, but the blue cities and states are declaring their emergencies.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.259]  It's also happening in Europe and Australia.
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:37.759]  And we just have to get this information out and take these big interviews with scientists like Dr. Robert Malone coming up later.
[00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:45.899]  Peter McCullough yesterday and shared them everywhere because this type of evil psyop cannot survive the light of truth.
[00:13:46.139 --> 00:13:48.340]  So this is your mission if you choose to accept it.
[00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:52.720]  If not, we are in for lockdowns, tyranny, way worse than we saw in the last five years.
[00:13:53.039 --> 00:13:56.820]  What should be happening in the Biden administration right now that isn't going on?
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.840]  Yeah, there are two main things that they should be doing in the days that they have left.
[00:14:01.019 --> 00:14:03.139]  The first is to get testing out there.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:09.320]  I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that just because we aren't testing, it doesn't mean that the virus isn't there.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.039]  It just means that we aren't looking for it.
[00:14:11.159 --> 00:14:24.080]  We should be having rapid tests, home tests available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:29.519]  And the second very important thing is this is not like the beginning of COVID where we were dealing with a new virus.
[00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:30.539]  We didn't have a vaccine.
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:40.600]  There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1. The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses of the vaccine.
[00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:44.539]  However, they have not asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.980]  There's research done on it.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:52.220]  They could get this authorized now and also get the vaccine out and to farm workers and to vulnerable people.
[00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:57.399]  I think that's the right approach because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu.
[00:14:57.639 --> 00:15:02.600]  If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization?
[00:15:03.059 --> 00:15:08.000]  If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing?
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.139]  I mean, that's a possibility.
[00:15:10.379 --> 00:15:18.759]  To me, the spring and the summer where we had all of the dairy cattle to farm worker exposure, we didn't have human flu circulating.
[00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:24.690]  So now we're entering a much more dangerous period, yet we're still not testing.
[00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:39.769]  And we should be providing tests free of charge to dairy farm workers so they can test anonymously weekly because they'll want to know if they have both cases of potential flu co-circulating in their own body to protect their families.
[00:15:39.929 --> 00:15:40.830]  People are very smart.
[00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.470]  I find the American public to be incredibly smart.
[00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:50.409]  If you tell them the risk and you give them the tools, They will utilize them to protect themselves and their family.
[00:15:51.090 --> 00:16:06.789]  Now, a lot of people ask me the question, if this whole biomedical system is being used by the globalists, as they admit it is, to try to bring in total control over society and depopulate and take control of our bodies, why, if it's been exposed,
[00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:08.269]  are they still running their operation?
[00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:26.240]  Because they built their whole globalist architecture at the UN and the WHO and these corporations To take control using a disease X. That's how I predicted it all decades ago and laid out the lockdowns and the six feet apart and the mask and the shots and the quarantine camps because they'd war-gamed it.
[00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:28.240]  They'd said they were going to use it for total control.
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:35.879]  And then when they collapsed the third world from the lockdowns, And people starve to death, and we get flooded by the third world, they say, oh, it's global warming causing it.
[00:16:36.039 --> 00:16:47.600]  And when they say, oh, about 2030, there'll be mass depopulation from global warming, no, that's because of their policies cutting off the resources, cutting off the energy, cutting off the fertilizers, and that causes a collapse.
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.639]  And they say, oh, look, global warming, man-made, you caused it.
[00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:52.389]  This is their plan.
[00:16:52.629 --> 00:17:01.289]  This is the Rio de Janeiro post-industrial 1992 meeting, and this is Limits to Growth and the Club of Rome and their own admissions.
[00:17:01.289 --> 00:17:12.609]  Go watch the WHO or the WEF. I mean, go to the World Economic Forum and all of them, and they admit all of this.
[00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:17.210]  And so finally people are going, wow, these people really are evil.
[00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:18.029]  They really are doing this.
[00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:18.789]  And I'm like, yeah!
[00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:20.809]  And let's organize and oppose it.
[00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:21.650]  And that's happening.
[00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:23.849]  So it's an amazing time to be alive.
[00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:24.890]  Back to the live broadcast.
[00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:26.289]  Dr. Robert Malone and others coming up.
[00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:27.809]  Last day of the year.
[00:17:28.009 --> 00:17:29.130]  So much more coming.
[00:17:29.289 --> 00:17:31.789]  Please stay with us and share the live links right now from Alex Jones.
[00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.049]  We reached tens of millions of new people yesterday because of you sharing the links.
[00:17:35.109 --> 00:17:36.630]  Let's do it again and let's stop these monsters.
[00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:40.990]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.190]  I am Chase Geyser, your host today.
[00:17:47.430 --> 00:18:06.150]  So much is unfolding this New Year's Eve, the last day of 2024, a year which will never be forgotten because of what we did on November 5th, all these things that have unfolded this year in way of the escalations to World War III. Changes in freedom of speech.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.940]  Astronomical Supreme Court rulings.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.799]  Unbelievable failures from this administration.
[00:18:15.319 --> 00:18:21.019]  Finally acknowledged by the left on June 27th after this wretched debate.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.240]  I mean, we've got so many whistleblowers and other reports.
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.259]  You guys already know.
[00:18:25.319 --> 00:18:36.460]  Biden's mind hasn't been working for at least four years and they covered it up and everybody in his staff knew and you guys already know and already knew, have known the whole time and they're just now admitting it.
[00:18:37.359 --> 00:18:39.920]  Because it's acceptable for the public to understand.
[00:18:41.799 --> 00:18:56.160]  But the latest development, which is the most shocking, probably the most alarming, maybe even the most dangerous story of the entire year of 2024, if not the entire administration of Joe Biden, is this bird flu.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:03.759]  And I was just astounded with the conversations I had yesterday with Dr. Peter McCullough and Tom Renz.
[00:19:05.119 --> 00:19:15.619]  I didn't realize until I spoke to Dr. McCullough yesterday that this strand of the bird flu had been manipulated with gain-of-function research.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.759]  And I was talking to Harrison Smith, of course, who hosts the American Journal from 8 a.m.
[00:19:19.779 --> 00:19:20.319]  to 11 a.m.
[00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:21.900]  on Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:19:22.019 --> 00:19:41.789]  You should follow him on X. I said, it's crazy that they manipulated the bird flu virus so that it could transfer from poultry to mallard ducks so that the ducks could spread the virus across large swaths of geography.
[00:19:42.269 --> 00:19:44.369]  Basically the entire continent, if not the entire world.
[00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:46.170]  And he said, you know what's interesting about that?
[00:19:46.289 --> 00:19:51.170]  You know that Russian whistleblower who was just assassinated in Moscow?
[00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:52.529]  Forgive me, I can't remember his name.
[00:19:53.970 --> 00:20:09.750]  He was saying that the bio labs in Ukraine were doing gain of function research to figure out how to make viruses infect birds so that it could spread across large regions.
[00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:22.930]  And it's funny how all of these conspiracies, they all seem so isolated until they finally come together and you realize that it's really all connected in one deep state web.
[00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.289]  But we know so much about this virus.
[00:20:30.269 --> 00:20:39.130]  And if we just paid attention, if we just draw attention to the important details surrounding it, I don't think anybody would be afraid of anything.
[00:20:39.569 --> 00:20:44.890]  It was first identified in 1961. The first human case was 1997 in Hong Kong.
[00:20:47.210 --> 00:21:10.369]  Claims that the mortality rate for this virus among humans is 50 to 60 percent are Vastly exaggerated, not only because the virus is now simply less deadly than it used to be as viruses become over time as they mutate, as they don't want to kill their hosts, but also because those who have died of this virus over the course of the last 30 years have primarily been in third-world countries sleeping with their chickens with no access to good quality health care.
[00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:21.289]  If we look even closer, we realize that there's no human-to-human transmission yet, so you're only likely to get it if you're interacting with very ill chickens.
[00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:23.609]  Or livestock?
[00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:25.190]  Or dead livestock?
[00:21:27.089 --> 00:21:37.910]  And then when you dive even deeper and you realize that over the course of the last four years, poultry farm fires have gone up 200% compared to the four years prior.
[00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:42.650]  Let me put it to you another way.
[00:21:43.069 --> 00:21:52.309]  During Biden's term, there have been 200% more poultry farm fires than during Trump's term.
[00:21:54.509 --> 00:21:59.450]  Four years Trump was the President of the United States, there were approximately 500,000 chickens killed in poultry farm fires.
[00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:05.789]  Under Biden's administration, there have been 1.5 million chickens killed in these fires.
[00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.230]  Why is it that fires have suddenly gone up 200% in the last four years?
[00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:11.609]  You're telling me that there's not arson involved or this isn't orchestrated?
[00:22:11.849 --> 00:22:15.430]  Now, is it a manufactured shortage that they're trying to create here?
[00:22:15.829 --> 00:22:23.430]  Are they trying to justify the acquisition of farmland, livestock, cattle, the conglomeration of it so they can control the market?
[00:22:24.619 --> 00:22:30.000]  Or are they just quietly culling these flocks that they deem to be infected with a dangerous virus?
[00:22:31.079 --> 00:22:36.599]  Is the CIA or national security apparatus going into these farms and just culling the herds quietly?
[00:22:36.779 --> 00:22:40.880]  If they can't do it legally, if they do it discreetly, it's okay because the farmers are going to get an insurance payout.
[00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:42.599]  No harm, no foul.
[00:22:43.259 --> 00:22:44.200]  No pun intended.
[00:22:50.099 --> 00:23:02.680]  But you look at this and you see, all right, well, between 2010 and 2014, there were three times the number of human cases of bird flu than there have been this year as of October.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.200]  According to the CDC's own data, according to the WHO's own data.
[00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:11.539]  So why is it then that it's every single mainstream media headline?
[00:23:11.779 --> 00:23:24.220]  Why is it that every single mainstream legacy media outlet is having expert on after expert on after expert on talking about the importance of vaccines, talking about the dangers of this flu, talking about how there's going to be a pandemic that starts on January 21st.
[00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:26.140]  We know about this virus.
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.140]  It's existed for at least 50 years.
[00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:31.369]  It's infected more humans in the past than it's infecting now.
[00:23:31.529 --> 00:23:34.450]  It was never a big issue then because they were so busy talking about Ebola.
[00:23:36.349 --> 00:23:40.869]  We just had to pick one, I guess, between 2010 and 2014. Should we hype up Ebola or should we hype up the bird flu?
[00:23:41.069 --> 00:23:50.990]  Well, the swine flu didn't turn out to be as deadly as we said a few years ago, so let's pivot to Ebola for a while, scare the hell out of a bunch of people about this, and then we can pivot back to the bird flu in the future and use that again to hype up everything.
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.519]  So the question is why?
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.539]  Why are they exaggerating this threat?
[00:23:57.599 --> 00:23:59.759]  And I think it's pretty obvious to this audience who pays attention.
[00:24:02.119 --> 00:24:09.279]  They learned so much from what happened in 2020 about the opportunity created from a public health crisis.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.980]  And what's more, it doesn't even have to be really a crisis.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:18.960]  I understand that COVID-19 is a real virus and it existed and that it was slightly more dangerous than the flu.
[00:24:20.059 --> 00:24:22.119]  Certainly not nearly as dangerous as they said it would be.
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.619]  Certainly not nearly as dangerous as getting the vaccines.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:32.700]  Certainly not nearly as dangerous as any of the measures that we took to respond to this pandemic.
[00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:46.089]  But they understand that they can do an ad campaign, do a media blitz campaign, and they can convince at least half the population that there's a serious health problem, regardless of whether or not there is, and that everyone will simply comply.
[00:24:46.089 --> 00:24:50.910]  And not only will they comply, but they'll actually call and rat on their neighbors for not complying.
[00:24:51.009 --> 00:24:53.190]  We know that Tim Walls had a hotline in his state.
[00:24:55.009 --> 00:25:03.910]  We know that Tim Walls had soldiers, National Guard, marching down the street, shooting at people on their porches if they were supposed to be inside during the lockdown with rubber bullets and paintballs.
[00:25:04.329 --> 00:25:05.289]  We saw it all.
[00:25:06.369 --> 00:25:07.910]  Straight from the Maoist playbook.
[00:25:08.609 --> 00:25:10.190]  He's not the only Maoist, by the way.
[00:25:10.309 --> 00:25:14.230]  Half the leftists, if not all the leftists, are Maoists, whether they know it or not.
[00:25:14.369 --> 00:25:16.789]  Just like all the globalists are Satanists, whether they know it or not.
[00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:30.349]  But what this government learned from 2020 was not, oh my goodness, we shouldn't ever do that again or handle something like this this way again.
[00:25:30.349 --> 00:25:31.069]  This was terrible.
[00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.710]  So many died.
[00:25:31.769 --> 00:25:32.470]  It was so unnecessary.
[00:25:33.109 --> 00:25:33.349]  No, no, no.
[00:25:33.369 --> 00:25:42.230]  What they learned was, oh, if we scare the hell out of people, we can lie as much as we want to accomplish this, then they will get in line for anything.
[00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:43.789]  We can change all the election laws.
[00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.369]  We can change all the regulations around health care.
[00:25:46.529 --> 00:25:48.609]  We can force inoculate the entire military.
[00:25:50.809 --> 00:25:51.930]  All the major corporations.
[00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:54.869]  We can tighten controls on travel.
[00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:59.529]  We can shut down any businesses except for those that we deem essential.
[00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:08.589]  And we can conspire with major corporations to ensure that all of their small business competitors go out of business so that they can conglomerate more of the market share.
[00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:17.210]  There's kickback on the vaccine front, the big pharma front, from every major corporation and every major industry for this.
[00:26:18.329 --> 00:26:21.829]  And you're telling me that we can fix the elections and cheat on elections if we do this?
[00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:34.650]  And we can totally undermine the successes or policies of any administration, regardless of whether they're Democratic or Republican, by shutting down the engine that runs the world, the United States of America?
[00:26:34.849 --> 00:26:40.170]  What they are doing is 2.0, pandemic 2.0, plandemic 2.0.
[00:26:40.329 --> 00:26:59.809]  What they are doing is setting the stage to ensure that as soon as Donald Trump is inaugurated, within 24 hours, Or seven days, I think within 24 hours, they're going to try to escalate this crisis in the eyes of the people, in the minds of the people, so they can totally cripple anything that Donald Trump tries to accomplish.
[00:26:59.829 --> 00:27:02.150]  And I pray to God that he doesn't fall for it.
[00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.589]  I pray to God that he doesn't fall forward again.
[00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:09.190]  I pray to God that he refuses to shut down the economy.
[00:27:09.329 --> 00:27:20.410]  That he refuses to conduct an Operation Warp Speed 2.0 and fund the vaccine which they, for some reason, already have prepared for this virus, even though there's no human-to-human transmission of it.
[00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.269]  I pray to God that he knows better, and I think he does.
[00:27:26.049 --> 00:27:42.390]  I think with the likes of RFK Jr. and others in this administration, Coupled with the fact that we have something very close to freedom of speech on the internet again through X. It's very vulnerable, fragile, because it is based on the whim of a single man,
[00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:49.450]  Elon Musk, who owns 79% of X. I mean, God knows what's going to happen to the platform if he ever decides to retire or, God forbid, dies.
[00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:57.369]  We are one heartbeat away from having virtually no freedom of speech whatsoever on the internet.
[00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:06.410]  But because of this administration that's coming in, and you hear about Democrats and Republicans saying that they don't have enough votes for some of the nominees.
[00:28:07.529 --> 00:28:11.349]  They want to support Mike Johnson, but they don't have enough votes for some of these nominees.
[00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:12.230]  It's going to be real tight.
[00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:14.009]  Peg Seth, it's going to be real tight.
[00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:16.890]  Kash Patel, I'm sorry, it's going to be really tight.
[00:28:17.009 --> 00:28:17.369]  We're going to see.
[00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.130]  Just make sure you stop posting on social media.
[00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.849]  It's going to be a risk.
[00:28:21.069 --> 00:28:22.450]  I'll tell you more about that breaking story.
[00:28:25.609 --> 00:28:27.230]  But I don't think it's going to work this time.
[00:28:30.079 --> 00:28:31.559]  And I'm not afraid of this.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:35.180]  I'm just so appalled.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.700]  I feel appalled.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.059]  That's the emotion about this bird flu narrative.
[00:28:41.039 --> 00:28:47.380]  First, I'm appalled that they have the audacity to do this again within four years.
[00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:54.660]  And then secondly, I'm appalled that I know so many people would just fall for it again.
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:09.539]  I mean, keep in mind, folks, there are people this week getting their 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th COVID booster when they never worked and all of the vaccine injury evidence is there.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.440]  Millions dead, myocarditis, turbo cancers.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:32.269]  I know far more people personally, apolitical people who don't pay attention, who have been injured from the vaccine than I know who died of COVID. I don't know a single person who died of COVID. I have not personally met a single person who died of COVID-19, and all the people I've heard of who've died of COVID-19 had comorbidities,
[00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:33.329]  they already had one foot out the door.
[00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:49.750]  So the last pandemic was so exaggerated, and the response to it was printing 40% of all dollars ever printed, basically eradicating our election integrity,
[00:29:50.650 --> 00:30:04.809]  shutting down the entire economy, A huge redistribution of wealth, especially in the form of buying power from the American working class to the American political class.
[00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:10.369]  And you're telling me that was a just response to the first pandemic?
[00:30:10.369 --> 00:30:16.490]  And you're telling me we should do it again and more for this bird flu, which people cannot even spread yet amongst themselves?
[00:30:16.569 --> 00:30:19.789]  And yes, maybe it will mutate into something that we can spread amongst ourselves, but so?
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:27.140]  I tell you what, folks, I would rather suffer the inconveniences of a pandemic than the inconveniences of a police state.
[00:30:27.259 --> 00:30:28.859]  And I'm not gonna let them use this.
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:36.480]  We cannot let them use this as an excuse, as a psychological operation to leverage themselves into more power and subjugation over us.
[00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:37.839]  We have to wake people up, folks.
[00:30:38.609 --> 00:30:43.329]  We're going to get into more news and reports on the other side of this break coming up in 43 seconds.

[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.259]  The globalists want you poor.
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.200]  They want you unhealthy.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.660]  They want us isolated.
[00:32:29.799 --> 00:32:32.940]  They don't want all this Patriot apparel out there so we realize how strong we are.
[00:32:33.109 --> 00:32:34.730]  And so we don't meet like-minded people.
[00:32:35.109 --> 00:32:37.430]  This thing is so exciting.
[00:32:37.569 --> 00:32:39.769]  I was sitting here before I sort of taping this announcement.
[00:32:39.769 --> 00:32:41.950]  I was thinking, how do I hype this enough?
[00:32:42.569 --> 00:32:47.630]  If people get excited about this, if folks take action with this information, it's incredible.
[00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:54.130]  And the folks who are doing it with, our great sponsor at TheAlexinStore.com, have done this with other talk shows, and it's been extremely successful.

[00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:21.210]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:23.269]  Now go to thealexjonesstore.com and sign up right now.
[00:33:24.309 --> 00:33:29.029]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Guiser, your host today, and I was talking to the crew about this bird flu thing.
[00:33:31.289 --> 00:33:35.150]  Thomas said something incredibly insightful, and I can't believe I hadn't thought of it.
[00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:35.849]  I'm sure others have.
[00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:36.670]  I'm sure you guys have.
[00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:38.230]  Thank you.
[00:33:41.930 --> 00:34:12.070]  If this bird flu is not successful in another lockdown, is not successful in shutting down the economy, is not successful in the forced vaccination of farmers or children, all the same things that we saw in 2020. That might be
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:12.349]  moot.
[00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:13.110]  It might not even matter.
[00:34:13.289 --> 00:34:14.010]  It might not even be why.
[00:34:16.769 --> 00:34:29.389]  I recall after talking to Thomas and the crew during this break, months if not years ago, reports that there were vaccines in the produce.
[00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:35.489]  So what they can do, we know that they've been experimenting with these fires.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:46.159]  Killing 1.5 million chickens over the course of the last four years, not to mention the actual culling that they've been doing.
[00:34:46.539 --> 00:34:53.659]  And we know that based on the case that happened in Louisiana, Gavin Newsom used that to justify a state of emergency in California.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:35:10.969]  A state of emergency which gives the state the authority to enter your property in hazmat suits, cull your livestock, your flocks, And they're quarantining these flocks right now, even though we know that the virus, because of gain-of-function research,
[00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:14.929]  is transmittable through mallard docks.
[00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.909]  So quarantining isn't even going to work.
[00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:23.949]  It seems obvious now.
[00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:39.500]  They're going to use this as an excuse to vaccinate all of the food supply And they're going to use mRNA vaccines because unlike many other vaccines,
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:44.420]  it's going to be transmissible from the food that you eat.
[00:35:46.219 --> 00:35:59.900]  They're trying to set up, they're trying to put in place the infrastructure to vaccinate you without you ever having to agree to a shot or without you ever even knowing that you've been vaccinated.
[00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:09.130]  Because when you get chicken thighs at the grocery store, or when you get beef at the grocery store and eat it, that's going to be your vaccination.
[00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.429]  That's what's going on here.
[00:36:11.769 --> 00:36:16.670]  This is a subversive way to vaccinate the population.
[00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:21.769]  Scientists testing mRNA vaccines to protect cows and people against the bird flu.
[00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:35.469]  And remember, folks, over the course of the last year or two, there has been a ramped-up campaign against things like raw chicken, raw eggs, raw milk, saying, oh, salmonella, salmonella, salmonella.
[00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:36.269]  We know it's not even true.
[00:36:36.369 --> 00:36:37.610]  I mean, has anybody ever seen Rocky?
[00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:43.570]  I've never even heard of anybody getting salmonella.
[00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:45.449]  I'm sure it happens on a fluke basis.
[00:36:47.389 --> 00:36:49.510]  But they don't like the raw food industry.
[00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:51.929]  They don't like the farm-to-table industry because...
[00:36:53.269 --> 00:37:05.789]  It's food that people consume that is not controlled and regulated by the government the same way and it's not vaccinated in the same way as all the mainstream Tyson conglomerate corporations.
[00:37:08.239 --> 00:37:10.280]  They're testing mRNA vaccines to protect cows.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:15.079]  We know that the vaccine that they've prepared for the bird flu is an mRNA vaccine.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.079]  Tom Wren said that to us when he was a guest on air yesterday on the Alex Jones show.
[00:37:18.179 --> 00:37:22.079]  We got Dr. Robert Malone coming on in an hour and a half.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:23.900]  I'm going to be asking him about this.
[00:37:25.039 --> 00:37:30.949]  Look at this article from September 16, 2021. Grow and eat your own vaccines?
[00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:37.309]  The future of vaccines may look more like eating a salad than getting a shot in the arm.
[00:37:37.469 --> 00:37:39.909]  UC Riverside, California, of course, state of emergency.
[00:37:40.269 --> 00:37:47.329]  Scientists are studying whether they can turn edible plants like lettuce into mRNA vaccine factories.
[00:37:48.429 --> 00:37:49.730]  Please pass the salad.
[00:37:49.889 --> 00:37:52.710]  Edible vaccines produced in lettuce to protect against COVID-19.
[00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:53.230]  They tried it.
[00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:56.070]  This is May 9th, 2022. Vaccines in your salad?
[00:37:57.059 --> 00:37:59.739]  Scientists growing medicine-filled plants to replace injections.
[00:38:00.219 --> 00:38:04.739]  And edible vaccine development for coronavirus disease, 2019. The concept.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.059]  Here's the study right here.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:15.260]  NIH. Emerging trends of edible vaccine therapy for combating human diseases, especially COVID-19.
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.500]  Pros, cons, and future challenges.
[00:38:16.679 --> 00:38:17.659]  Another NIH study.
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.539]  Edible vaccines.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.460]  Here's another study.
[00:38:23.789 --> 00:38:27.690]  Disease prevention, an opportunity to expand edible plant-based vaccines.
[00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:32.869]  Can these technologies take the needles out of vaccines?
[00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:39.369]  If they can do it through the produce, through the plants, then they can do it through the livestock and the food as well.
[00:38:39.969 --> 00:38:40.889]  Through the cattle.
[00:38:41.889 --> 00:38:45.769]  So what they're doing is they're ramping up the shortages.
[00:38:47.059 --> 00:38:48.380]  So the prices go up.
[00:38:48.619 --> 00:38:52.320]  When the prices go up, the public says, hey, what the hell is going on?
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.760]  Why is chicken so expensive?
[00:38:54.019 --> 00:38:55.800]  Why are eggs so expensive?
[00:38:56.019 --> 00:38:56.960]  Why is there a shortage?
[00:38:57.139 --> 00:38:58.820]  Why is beef so expensive?
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.340]  I've actually got a clip here on the list.
[00:39:03.599 --> 00:39:04.599]  Guys, you'll have to look.
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.199]  I have a millennial talking about how expensive chicken is at the grocery store.
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:09.280]  Can you let me know which one it is?
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.719]  And then when the public, when the consumers...
[00:39:14.539 --> 00:39:15.820]  Complain about these prices.
[00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:28.840]  They say, oh, well, the reason there's a shortage in the livestock is because this bird flu, I know it's not been impacting humans, but this bird flu has been killing millions upon millions of chickens and the cows.
[00:39:30.199 --> 00:39:39.579]  That coupled with the fact that we've had all these poultry farm fires as a result of climate change, which have killed 1.5 million chickens in the last four years.
[00:39:41.199 --> 00:39:44.679]  Has led to a shortage which has caused the price increase.
[00:39:45.559 --> 00:40:03.559]  So if you want your chicken and your beef to be affordable again, if you want inflation to go back down again, then the federal government is going to need to fund big pharma to go from herd to herd to herd,
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:11.119]  flock to flock to flock, farm to farm to farm, starting in California and then the rest of the country.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:18.219]  And vaccinate with these mRNA vaccines all of the animals.
[00:40:19.639 --> 00:40:27.340]  But what they won't tell you is that when you eat those vaccinated animals, you then are infected, inoculated with the mRNA technology.
[00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:28.320]  Let's watch this clip.
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:29.099]  Thank you for finding it.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.800]  So, girls, what have we learned about grocery shopping?
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:34.840]  I don't want to be an adult.
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:35.920]  I don't want to be an adult.
[00:40:36.119 --> 00:40:41.820]  It takes me an hour worth of working, and I still can't even buy this.
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:42.400]  There's three.
[00:40:42.639 --> 00:40:44.820]  And it's three pieces of chicken.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:49.860]  An hour of working doesn't buy me one thing of chicken at all.
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.719]  I'd be lucky if I got two.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:57.840]  An entire generation like that, working for minimum wage, can't afford to buy chicken unless they work for two hours.
[00:40:58.650 --> 00:40:59.929]  That's happening all over the country.
[00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:03.969]  It hasn't been happening for the last four years, especially the last year because of these shortages.
[00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:08.630]  I mean, we have Pete Terry's here in Texas coming out and saying, sorry, we had to raise the chicken price, but there's a shortage.
[00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:10.650]  So we raised the prices.
[00:41:10.929 --> 00:41:17.210]  My mother-in-law could not find eggs for Christmas in California because there's an artificial manufactured egg shortage there.
[00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:19.989]  She finally found a dozen eggs.
[00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:22.710]  I think it was $12 for a dozen eggs in California, Orange County, California.
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.960]  Gavin Newsom is declaring it's an emergency, quarantining everything.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.400]  There's calling happening.
[00:41:28.539 --> 00:41:29.699]  It's all justified in the law.
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:37.519]  The omnibus bill, $1.2 trillion that they almost passed, they tried to pass two weeks ago, would have expanded all of these responses to a pandemic for no reason obvious.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.559]  This is the path forward.
[00:41:41.679 --> 00:41:44.800]  They know that they have wrecked their reputation.
[00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:46.369]  With vaccines.
[00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:55.409]  They know that RFK Jr. and what they did by pushing these vaccines in 2020 absolutely eradicated whatever credibility reputation vaccines had forever.
[00:41:55.610 --> 00:42:01.869]  I mean, I was somebody who got vaccines whenever my doctor said.
[00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:11.489]  The last vaccine I got, I was opening a box with a rusty knife, a K bar from World War II, my grandfather's.
[00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:12.510]  It was the only one I had laying around.
[00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:13.010]  It's rusty.
[00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:20.010]  And when I opened the box, I got away from it and I cut my thumb really bad with this rusty knife.
[00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:23.230]  First thing I did was go to an urgent care and get a tetanus shot.
[00:42:25.889 --> 00:42:36.469]  Now, after what they did with these vaccines in 2020 and all the research I've done and seen and all the experts I've spoken with, I'm never getting another vaccine again no matter what.
[00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:42.469]  I don't care what they say about how safe it is or how effective it is or how necessary it is or what the risks are as I age.
[00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:45.090]  I am never getting another vaccine for the rest of my life.
[00:42:45.369 --> 00:42:47.889]  My children will never be vaccinated as long as they're my children.
[00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:50.070]  I mean, they can do whatever they want when they're adults to their own bodies.
[00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:52.429]  But I'm done.
[00:42:53.329 --> 00:43:09.760]  So, given the fact that the pharmaceutical industry has realized that it has taken a major hit In terms of vaccine revenue because there are tens of millions of Americans like me and you and others who are never going to get one again because of what they did.
[00:43:12.079 --> 00:43:13.940]  They're now trying to figure out ways.
[00:43:14.119 --> 00:43:25.260]  They're trying to conspire, collude with the government to figure out ways to continue to vaccinate the populace despite the fact that the populace doesn't ever want to volunteer for a vaccine ever again.
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:25.960]  And this is it.
[00:43:26.139 --> 00:43:27.039]  This is it right here.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.739]  Oh, there's this dangerous bird flu.
[00:43:30.119 --> 00:43:35.579]  Oh, there's this shortage of all these Animals, chickens, cows.
[00:43:36.039 --> 00:43:36.579]  Just wait.
[00:43:36.719 --> 00:43:37.519]  It's going to be cows next.
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:47.239]  If you don't like the shortage, and they won't try to convince you, the American people, they'll just try to convince the federal government and the bureaucrats, and they'll listen.
[00:43:47.719 --> 00:43:48.699]  They're going to go to the feds.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.960]  They're going to say, listen, we have this massive agricultural issue.
[00:43:51.119 --> 00:43:53.619]  We have this massive shortage issue for food supply.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.860]  This is what it's going to mean if it continues like this.
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.519]  All of these animals are going to die.
[00:43:58.599 --> 00:43:59.840]  All the prices are going to go up.
[00:44:02.119 --> 00:44:09.539]  We gotta stop this and the only way for us to do it is to inoculate all of the livestock in the United States of America with the mRNA vaccines.
[00:44:12.599 --> 00:44:23.420]  And I just showed you study after study after study after study that mRNA vaccines can be put into food and then inoculate whoever eats that food.
[00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:33.610]  So then what you're gonna see is not just a bird flu vaccine or a bird flu mRNA vaccine going into these animals.
[00:44:33.809 --> 00:44:34.789]  That'll be the first one.
[00:44:34.929 --> 00:44:38.090]  Then it'll be a different flu strand every year.
[00:44:38.289 --> 00:44:46.619]  So if you're somebody who never gets their flu shot, well, if you eat a chicken thigh for dinner, Or if you make a chicken casserole, that's your flu shot.
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:54.840]  And then once that works, it won't be just the flu stuff, but it'll be measles, mumps, rubella, polio, bubonic, whatever disease you could think of.
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:45:10.039]  I mean, we saw the clip over and over again of Hotez, the bow-tied scientist in the fluorescently lit office, listing every virus he could think of off the top of his head, saying that January 21st was gonna be a major onset of the next pandemic.
[00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:14.750]  Emphasizing the bird flu, but listing many other viruses in that clip.
[00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:33.730]  Any illness you can possibly think of, whether it's swine flu, whether it's Ebola, whether it's bird flu, whether it's coronavirus, whether it's all the variations of the coronavirus, every single year, they're just going to give it to the livestock instead of to the populace because the populace will never voluntarily agree to do it.
[00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:41.840]  And they can make the same money, Inoculating chickens all across the continent and then inoculating you.
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.239]  What's even more alarming is that the national security apparatus loves this.
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:51.760]  Oh, this is an awesome mechanism because we are very concerned about bio warfare into the future.
[00:45:52.179 --> 00:46:01.500]  Remember that $1.2 trillion omnibus bill funded, and it said in this way, no less than 12 bio labs.
[00:46:01.619 --> 00:46:03.840]  We know that we've lost access to a lot of our bio labs in Ukraine.
[00:46:05.269 --> 00:46:07.269]  A lot of attention was drawn to those bio labs in Ukraine.
[00:46:07.429 --> 00:46:17.550]  We know that Metabiota was given $23.7 million by the Department of Defense after Hunter Biden invested in it, while Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States to do research in the bio labs in Ukraine and Wuhan virology.
[00:46:19.769 --> 00:46:22.110]  But now we're losing control and access to these bio labs.
[00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:24.690]  We had to fund at least 12 more.
[00:46:27.559 --> 00:46:45.119]  The national security apparatus is gonna say, all right, well, if biowarfare is the future of warfare and we can't get our population to voluntarily agree to be vaccinated, then if we want to vaccinate them and protect them, our subjects, our assets, our taxpayers that fund our political class and our corruption,
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.800]  then we're simply going to have to do it through the food they eat because they've gotta eat.
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.039]  This is the future of inoculation.
[00:46:54.039 --> 00:46:57.480]  It's not getting in a line and getting a jab in your arm.
[00:46:57.599 --> 00:47:02.780]  It's not presidents of the United States getting jabs, whether fake or not, on TV and fake sets.
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:08.340]  It's not politicians or executives or influencers showing you a picture of the Band-Aid on their arm.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:16.139]  It's simply a bunch of chickens and cows being inoculated, big pharma being paid, the federal government paying for it.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.460]  You don't even have to hear about it.
[00:47:17.539 --> 00:47:20.739]  And then you take a bite out of it and boom, you are vaccinated.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:21.960]  That is what's going on.
[00:47:25.019 --> 00:47:26.260]  Big Pharma makes a bunch of money.
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:27.840]  You don't even know you're getting vaccinated.
[00:47:28.059 --> 00:47:31.539]  The state loves it because they can spend your money and they can get kickback on all the spending.
[00:47:33.219 --> 00:47:35.820]  Everybody wins except for you.
[00:47:36.079 --> 00:47:41.480]  And that's why they've come out so hard against things like raw milk, raw eggs, raw meat.
[00:47:41.679 --> 00:47:44.199]  They've been pushing this artificial meat too as well.
[00:47:44.239 --> 00:47:45.280]  We know it's loaded with sodium.
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:46.380]  It's totally unhealthy for you.
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:51.460]  I mean, just anybody with common sense can look at what a fake hamburger is made out of and know that it's worse for you than a regular beef hamburger.
[00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:55.070]  But they're coming out against all of this alternative food.
[00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:56.510]  They don't want you raising your own chickens.
[00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:19.869]  I don't know.
[00:48:19.949 --> 00:48:20.789]  Maybe the crew can look it up.
[00:48:20.849 --> 00:48:22.389]  I believe our milk...
[00:48:22.559 --> 00:48:26.780]  In the United States, not the raw milk, but the standard stuff that they have in the store, the name brand stuff.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:31.840]  I believe our milk is actually illegal in many nations throughout the world.
[00:48:32.119 --> 00:48:35.340]  Or the way in which we do our milk is illegal in many nations throughout the world.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:36.559]  Please look that up.
[00:48:37.219 --> 00:48:52.699]  So while the rest of the world acknowledges that what we're doing to our food is poisoning our populace, that fluoride in the water is making us retarded, that atrazine in the water is turning the frogs gay, That the food dyes and Froot Loops are making kids have behavior issues,
[00:48:53.059 --> 00:48:57.940]  ADD, cognitive issues, anxiety, mental illness.
[00:49:00.639 --> 00:49:13.719]  While the rest of the world knows that what we do to our population through the food and the water and the air is a major human rights violation, a major health issue.
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:24.019]  Our government is still able to get away with doing this and to get away with saying that raw milk is the real problem because you'll get salmonella.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:43.940]  Look, folks, I don't know what the odds are of you getting salmonella from a raw egg or from drinking raw milk, but the odds of you having an IQ, a whole standard deviation lower than what you're genetically capable of because you've been drinking tap water with fluoride in it your entire life are virtually guaranteed.
[00:49:44.599 --> 00:49:50.679]  So they're happy Guaranteeing that you will have diminished cognitive functioning.
[00:49:51.039 --> 00:49:59.199]  They're happy guaranteeing that you will have depression and ADD and mental illness and anxiety through all the stuff that they put in the food and they allow to be put in the food.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:07.380]  They're happy guaranteeing that you'll be obese because the high fructose corn syrup, which has replaced sugar in virtually all of our food, whether it's soda or anything else.
[00:50:08.639 --> 00:50:12.199]  But they don't want you to eat a grass-fed cow.
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:14.880]  They don't want you to eat a happy chicken.
[00:50:15.079 --> 00:50:17.039]  They don't want you to eat a raw egg.
[00:50:17.159 --> 00:50:19.059]  They don't want you to drink raw milk.
[00:50:19.239 --> 00:50:21.239]  We have to come down on this raw milk.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:28.639]  Even though the odds of getting sick from it are so minuscule, so minute, so just negligible, nominal.
[00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:39.449]  Why is it that they care so much about your health when it comes to those odds, but not at all about your health when it comes to virtually everything else about our civilization, our society?
[00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:45.409]  I mean, we had Michelle Obama doing the Let's Move campaign until some of her movements were a little too revealing.
[00:50:45.889 --> 00:50:53.309]  Back when I was in high school, 2008, I remember, suddenly all the sodas disappeared from the vending machines because they were unhealthy, and they were unhealthy.
[00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:55.369]  But they didn't replace them.
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:01.340]  With fluoride-free water in glass bottles so you didn't get microplastics.
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.519]  They didn't replace them with vitamin drinks.
[00:51:04.639 --> 00:51:12.280]  They didn't replace them with Ultimate Hydro Force from the AlexJonesStore.com or Vitamin Mineral Fusion from DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:20.000]  They replaced them with these diet sodas that have cancer-causing, Alzheimer's-causing ingredients and artificial sweeteners in it.
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.679]  So instead of drinking a Coca-Cola, you're drinking a Diet Coke.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.079]  Sorry, you're going to get Alzheimer's.
[00:51:24.239 --> 00:51:25.239]  Sorry, you're going to get cancer.
[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:29.219]  See, the thing is, they don't care about your health at all.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:33.500]  It's not just the government that doesn't care about your health, it's also the pharmaceutical companies that don't care about your health.
[00:51:33.739 --> 00:51:37.500]  They definitely don't want you healthy because when you're healthy, you don't pay for healthcare.
[00:51:39.699 --> 00:51:46.460]  And what's more is, the health insurance companies, because of the great Affordable Care Act, they don't want you to be healthy either.
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:51.780]  And I'll explain to you why, but think about it like this.
[00:51:53.139 --> 00:52:02.269]  When it comes to car insurance, Your car insurance company does not want you to get into car accidents because they lose money.
[00:52:02.869 --> 00:52:03.949]  Very obvious, right?
[00:52:04.389 --> 00:52:07.250]  Get in a car accident, your insurance company has to pay for it.
[00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:08.889]  That's how they lose money.
[00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:09.809]  That's their overhead.
[00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:17.309]  And many insurance companies like Progressive and others, they even have apps that you can install on your phone that monitor your driving.
[00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:24.389]  And the safer you drive, the lower your rate is because they don't want you to get into accidents.
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.840]  Same process for life insurance companies.
[00:52:29.039 --> 00:52:31.199]  Same process for homeowners insurance companies.
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:42.239]  Basically, every single type of insurance company does not want you to file a claim except for the health insurance industry thanks to the Affordable Care Act.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:42.940]  And here's why.
[00:52:43.199 --> 00:52:54.460]  Health insurance companies are legally prohibited from making more than 15% to 20%, depending on the type of coverage, above the cost of health care.
[00:52:56.130 --> 00:53:06.469]  So if healthcare costs a million dollars, they can only make $200,000 over that.
[00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:14.110]  So what are they supposed to do if they want to make more than $200,000?
[00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:18.630]  Well, we got to have more people making claims.
[00:53:19.409 --> 00:53:26.579]  And we got to make sure that that surgery that you paid a million dollars for for It's worth 1.5 next year.
[00:53:26.739 --> 00:53:28.460]  That's why the premiums go up every year.
[00:53:28.739 --> 00:53:33.420]  That's why the health insurance companies actually want the cost of healthcare to get more and more expensive.
[00:53:33.659 --> 00:53:35.139]  They don't want you healthy.
[00:53:35.239 --> 00:53:36.579]  The insurance companies don't want you healthy.
[00:53:36.719 --> 00:53:38.239]  The doctors don't want you healthy.
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:39.980]  The pharmaceutical companies don't want you healthy.
[00:53:40.119 --> 00:53:49.099]  And the members of our political class who are personally invested in all these publicly traded big pharmaceutical companies don't want you healthy whatsoever because they don't make any money if you're healthy.
[00:53:50.179 --> 00:53:51.340]  That's why there's no cure.
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:52.119]  There's only treatment.
[00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:54.210]  They're only dealing with symptoms.
[00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:55.690]  They want to solve these problems.
[00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:58.829]  That's happened before in other industries.
[00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:05.070]  I'm told that the Germans may have engineered a tire that never wore out in World War II. Where did that go?
[00:54:06.469 --> 00:54:10.510]  What, have there been three people who have invented an automobile that can run on water?
[00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:11.889]  They've all died mysteriously.
[00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:13.630]  Am I right about that?
[00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:16.929]  It's just the nature of things.
[00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:18.329]  Everything is incentive-based.
[00:54:22.139 --> 00:54:29.840]  And the nice thing about vaccines for these pharmaceutical companies is it's a great way to get people to pay for your service even when they are healthy.
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:35.980]  See, the vaccine thing was a brilliant part of this marketing strategy, this business strategy for Big Pharma.
[00:54:36.639 --> 00:54:42.699]  Because they ran into this problem that, hey, we have reached total market saturation.
[00:54:44.159 --> 00:54:46.480]  Only sick people are paying for our services.
[00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:51.730]  How can we branch into the healthy market?
[00:54:52.909 --> 00:54:55.010]  Obviously, you're not going to the doctor and getting drugs.
[00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:56.690]  If you're healthy, you go when you're sick.
[00:54:56.869 --> 00:55:03.449]  So how can we make money off of healthy people, given that people only need our services when they're sick, our products when they're sick?
[00:55:03.989 --> 00:55:05.610]  Well, let's do vaccine.
[00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:14.210]  We can ensure that people will get vaccines on a predictable schedule, whether it's children, whether it's a new flu shot that never works every single year.
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:19.000]  They're healthy, they're not sick, they're always paying for our services.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.719]  It's called reoccurring revenue, folks.
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:23.400]  It's basically a subscription model for big pharma.
[00:55:23.519 --> 00:55:24.800]  That's what the vaccine industry was.
[00:55:29.119 --> 00:55:36.039]  And now that they've lost that recurring revenue because of lack of faith in their products, their services, what they've done because they lied and it's so dangerous.
[00:55:39.159 --> 00:55:40.800]  Keep that up on the screen, I'm gonna read it in a second.
[00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:45.079]  They have to inoculate us through the food supply.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:50.159]  How can veterinary vaccines adversely affect human health?
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.880]  News Medical Life Sciences.
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:56:00.300]  Increased use of veterinary vaccines may increase human exposure to vaccine strains which in turn can adversely affect human health.
[00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:03.150]  And there's study after study after study.
[00:56:03.309 --> 00:56:04.510]  This is what it is.
[00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:09.429]  It's a max vaccination strategy, and it's not gonna stop with just the bird flu.
[00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:15.170]  It's gonna be every illness, and it's gonna be experimental MKUltra-type stuff from the government as well.
[00:56:15.769 --> 00:56:24.489]  We have intelligence, reliable, credible intelligence that Russia is developing this strain of this virus, and that China is developing this strain of this virus.
[00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:37.369]  And so we need to vaccinate our populace unwittingly in the event of an escalation to World War III. So we're going to mass inoculate all of the livestock, all the chickens, all the cows, and then when people eat, they'll be vaccinated.
[00:56:39.849 --> 00:56:41.210]  But here's where it gets really ugly.
[00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:51.590]  If you're worried about euthanasia causing death panels like they have in Canada, I think it was at one in 20 deaths last year in Canada for euthanasia.
[00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:57.769]  Just imagine what they'll inoculate you with if they're in bed with pharmaceutical companies.
[00:56:57.889 --> 00:57:05.130]  What if these new cancer drugs are really profitable for pharmaceutical companies that our politicians are invested in?
[00:57:05.289 --> 00:57:16.869]  Why can't we sneak a little mRNA vaccine in all of the livestock that we know is going to cause turbo cancer with a latent onset so it's not suspicious?
[00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:18.889]  People won't even know they got the vaccine.
[00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:20.449]  They'll just have chicken dinner.
[00:57:21.739 --> 00:57:24.440]  And then we can make a lot of money off of giving people cancer.
[00:57:24.579 --> 00:57:26.840]  We can make a lot of money off of making people sick.
[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:27.960]  Now they want you sick.
[00:57:28.099 --> 00:57:32.500]  Not only are they not trying to keep you healthy, now they actually want you sick in a whole other level, folks.
[00:57:32.719 --> 00:57:33.199]  Stay tuned.
[00:57:33.619 --> 00:57:34.820]  It's time to take action.
[00:57:35.179 --> 00:57:40.980]  So for a lot of you out there, this is free and you can make supplemental money very easily.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:44.460]  I mean, I would imagine most people can make hundreds of bucks a month with their eyes closed.
[00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:50.349]  And if you really kick ass, thousands of dollars, even if you have a tiny, you know, X account or Facebook or whatever.
[00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:59.050]  But if you're a talk show host, I mean, you can make a living and finance your show and maybe even, you know, hire reporters or whatever.
[00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:00.469]  I mean, this is exciting.
[00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:03.769]  So, go now to thelshostore.com.
[00:58:03.909 --> 00:58:04.829]  And one other thing.
[00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:07.869]  There are five limited edition fundraiser posters.
[00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:09.809]  And by fundraiser, everything raises funds there.
[00:58:09.869 --> 00:58:13.510]  But the t-shirts cost like 16, 17 bucks a piece before you buy them.
[00:58:13.650 --> 00:58:16.190]  And then the sponsor gets half and we get half.
[00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:20.630]  And to run all this and build a new network as a backup, you know, we're squeaking by.
[00:58:20.849 --> 00:58:27.690]  But when something says fundraiser on it, like a t-shirt that's cost double or a poster, yeah, the poster costs five, six bucks.
[00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:31.449]  I mean, the shipping, we ship it in the special packaging costs as much as the poster itself.
[00:58:32.019 --> 00:58:37.579]  So, you know, $6, $7, $8, $9 for the poster cost with the packaging, and then we're selling it for $25, $30.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.820]  That's because there's some real markup in there to fund it.
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:41.239]  So you know you're buying something.
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.579]  It's a memento that you really back what we're doing.
[00:58:44.119 --> 00:58:47.380]  The campaign coins, challenge coins, they're all there.
[00:58:48.619 --> 00:58:54.940]  So the posters run from $19.95 to $29.95, and we'll have new limited edition posters after that.
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:59:00.760]  But the posters on January 6th will be no more.
[00:59:01.619 --> 00:59:06.360]  They're limited edition, so if you get your order in by then, you will get the poster because they're print on demand.
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:07.019]  They're in Arkansas.
[00:59:07.599 --> 00:59:09.800]  If you want one of these posters, there they are.
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:14.199]  And again, you've got until January 6th to get your order in.
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:15.539]  They look great hanging on the wall.
[00:59:15.619 --> 00:59:17.699]  We got them hanging here in the office.
[00:59:17.739 --> 00:59:20.239]  And I designed all of these.
[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:25.699]  My favorite is the Trump graph that I showed the day before the election that predicted the election.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:27.880]  I said, she's going to try to steal it, but it's going to fail.
[00:59:28.099 --> 00:59:33.139]  So the blue line goes up and goes straight up, but it's not enough fraud to overpower the landslide.
[00:59:33.239 --> 00:59:35.280]  And that's actually the graph that actually happened.
[00:59:35.659 --> 00:59:36.760]  The key battlegrounds.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.699]  So you talk about nailing it, baby.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:39.920]  That's my favorite.
[00:59:40.019 --> 00:59:40.840]  I designed that one.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.119]  And then the 47th one I designed as well.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.400]  So I designed those.
[00:59:45.039 --> 00:59:47.320]  I did not design the Darkest Hour one, but there it is.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:48.099]  Thank you for the support.
[00:59:48.199 --> 00:59:48.800]  I'm done plugging.
[00:59:49.239 --> 00:59:59.559]  I've just been looking at all the attacks and our victories in court, and I realized how much money it takes to take these people on, and they are so pissed we're still on air, and I have hired high-powered lawyers.
[00:59:59.659 --> 01:00:00.380]  That's why we're winning.
[01:00:06.519 --> 01:00:10.780]  My lawyers are working seven days a week.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.980]  Because I go and meet with them almost every day.
[01:00:13.139 --> 01:00:16.760]  I mean, they call me at midnight and say, come to the office, I want you to read this and sign it, make sure it's accurate.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.980]  I mean, we are...
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:25.579]  If I told you all the suits we followed on and all the craft we're doing to bloom, you know, to the whole deep state, because I can't be on defense anymore.
[01:00:25.639 --> 01:00:26.300]  I got to go on offense.
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:28.420]  It would take an hour to go over it all.
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.340]  But you want me to fight, I'm fighting.
[01:00:32.119 --> 01:00:32.420]  So...
[01:00:33.949 --> 01:00:42.409]  You're financing the current operation, you're financing the Backup Palace Jokes Network if it gets shut down, and that's still getting built and expanded, not, you know, a larger studio, almost done.
[01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:45.530]  And you're financing the legal defense and offense.
[01:00:45.769 --> 01:00:46.690]  I mean, this is a war.
[01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:47.869]  You want somebody to fight for you?
[01:00:48.369 --> 01:00:49.269]  I love it.
[01:00:49.889 --> 01:00:52.650]  I mean, I'm begging for you to keep me in the game, keep me in the fight, Coach.
[01:00:52.829 --> 01:00:54.250]  But I'm here, you're serving.
[01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:55.590]  You commission me.
[01:00:56.650 --> 01:01:02.570]  Look, I won't stop regardless of what happens, but I'm asking you to empower me, and I will give you everything I got.
[01:01:02.949 --> 01:01:09.250]  I'm so focused right now and so sick of this crap and the stuff they've been doing to my family behind the scenes, just absolutely criminal.
[01:01:09.869 --> 01:01:12.610]  And so all I'm asking for is the support to keep fighting.
[01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:14.730]  And we make it easy with incredible products, okay?
[01:01:14.849 --> 01:01:15.309]  I'm done.
[01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:35.630]  2025 is going to suck.
[01:01:35.969 --> 01:01:37.510]  So I said it's time to get fucked up.
[01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:42.889]  You said always.
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:17.280]  I'm in love with the coke, coke, coke, coke I got it for the lolo.
[01:02:18.719 --> 01:02:21.179]  I'm in love with the coco.
[01:02:22.699 --> 01:02:25.199]  I'm in love with the coco.
[01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:33.300]  I got it for the lolo.
[01:02:33.659 --> 01:02:34.360]  Turn up!
[01:02:35.139 --> 01:02:37.179]  I'm in love with the coco.
[01:02:38.539 --> 01:02:41.179]  Hit my plug, that's my cholo.
[01:02:42.989 --> 01:02:45.289]  Cause he got it for the lolo.
[01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:49.349]  If you snitching, I go loco.
[01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:57.190]  Hit you with that 38. Thinking that I'm solo.
[01:02:58.929 --> 01:03:01.269]  50 deep, they like, oh no.
[01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:05.150]  Heard the fans taking photos.
[01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:09.210]  I know nothing the bobo.
[01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:13.449]  Baking soda, I got baking soda.
[01:03:14.809 --> 01:03:17.489]  Baking soda, I got baking soda.
[01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.090]  Whip it through the glass.
[01:03:22.809 --> 01:03:24.929]  I'm blowing money fast.
[01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:29.210]  I'm in love with the cocoa.
[01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:33.190]  I'm in love with the cocoa.
[01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:37.210]  I got it for the lolo.
[01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:41.190]  I'm in love with the coco.
[01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:45.230]  I'm in love with the coco.
[01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:49.210]  I'm in love with the coco.
[01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:53.329]  I got it for the lolo.
[01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:57.230]  I'm in love with the coco.
[01:03:58.789 --> 01:04:01.130]  36, that's a kilo.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:11.280]  Does the president have the stamina, physically and mentally, do you think to continue on even after 2024?
[01:04:11.579 --> 01:04:13.380]  Don, you're asking me this question.
[01:04:13.639 --> 01:04:15.940]  Oh my gosh, he's the president of the United States.
[01:04:16.139 --> 01:04:19.119]  You know, he, I can't even keep up with him.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:31.539]  The most difficult part about a meeting with President Biden is preparing for it, because he is sharp, intensely probing, and detail-oriented and focused.
[01:04:31.719 --> 01:04:35.500]  I can testify, because I've been working very closely with this president for the past two years.
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:36.760]  I've been knowing him for 30 years.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.639]  And I'm telling you, this guy's tough, he's smart, he's on his game.
[01:04:40.739 --> 01:04:46.150]  Joe Biden has vision, he has knowledge, he has He's a strategic thinker.
[01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:48.230]  The president is focused.
[01:04:48.550 --> 01:04:49.710]  He's detail-oriented.
[01:04:49.989 --> 01:04:52.309]  He's always thinking about the big picture.
[01:04:52.469 --> 01:04:53.110]  He's engaging.
[01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:54.210]  He is capable.
[01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:56.710]  He has an incredible record as president.
[01:04:57.059 --> 01:05:00.440]  And I'm often with him on foreign trips.
[01:05:00.679 --> 01:05:02.559]  He's at the top of his game.
[01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:03.579]  So he has a vision.
[01:05:03.679 --> 01:05:04.380]  He has knowledge.
[01:05:04.579 --> 01:05:05.739]  He has judgment.
[01:05:06.119 --> 01:05:08.099]  He has a strategic thinking.
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:12.820]  I met with the president, I don't know, five or six weeks ago, and he seemed fine to me.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.699]  I have complete confidence in the president.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:21.519]  I have watched him expertly guide meetings of staff and cabinet members.
[01:05:21.699 --> 01:05:24.280]  I could not have more confidence in the president.
[01:05:24.449 --> 01:05:33.130]  I would just tell you that I meet frequently with the president, and every single time I meet with him, he is just fine.
[01:05:33.369 --> 01:05:37.530]  But he is, again, knowledgeable, wise.
[01:05:37.989 --> 01:05:43.090]  Incredibly sharp, incredibly probing, incredible command of the details.
[01:05:43.409 --> 01:05:44.309]  He is sharp.
[01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:46.010]  He is on top of things.
[01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:52.190]  There is nothing to these challenges, these suggestions that somehow he's not sharp and he's not capable.
[01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:54.190]  We see Joe Biden up close.
[01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:57.389]  We know how attuned he is to the issue.
[01:05:57.469 --> 01:06:00.650]  And you're gonna see how smart he is and the experience he has.
[01:06:00.849 --> 01:06:02.909]  I say his age is an asset.
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:04.699]  He's wise.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.159]  Yes, he's wise.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.019]  He has wisdom.
[01:06:07.199 --> 01:06:07.900]  He has experience.
[01:06:08.079 --> 01:06:15.000]  And his experience because of his age and his wisdom has been invaluable to this country.
[01:06:15.159 --> 01:06:20.239]  A lot of countries, people who've been in office a longer period of time are praised for their wisdom.
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:27.480]  I have seen a lot of 72-year-olds not as capable as this 80-year-old.
[01:06:27.639 --> 01:06:30.300]  It is hard for us to keep up with this president.
[01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:32.380]  His mental acuity is great.
[01:06:33.199 --> 01:06:35.679]  2024 is almost over.
[01:06:36.139 --> 01:06:39.400]  And I was looking back on the last 365 days.
[01:06:40.610 --> 01:06:44.050]  And thinking about a report that I wanted to shoot describing what's happened this year.
[01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:46.489]  And it's just amazing.
[01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:49.190]  And I think you'll all agree the evidence is there for everybody.
[01:06:49.909 --> 01:07:01.070]  This is the year that the globalist, BlackRock, New World Order, transhumanist, Anglo-American establishment plan for global government was mortally wounded.
[01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:15.849]  Now that doesn't mean it's dead yet, but it's like if you're deer hunting, and this is an analogy, I'm not calling for violence, and you shoot a big buck from 300 yards away and you even get him in the heart, he'll still run 20, 30, 50 yards, sometimes 100 yards into the woods.
[01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:17.789]  But he's mortally wounded.
[01:07:20.889 --> 01:07:23.829]  The death throes of their system is what's going to be dangerous.
[01:07:23.949 --> 01:07:24.449]  We're in that right now.
[01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:33.170]  They're trying to accelerate global war to keep control, new pandemics with the H5N1, which top scientists have come out and proven it was made in a lab.
[01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:36.110]  They're continuing to try to implode borders.
[01:07:36.449 --> 01:07:40.889]  They're continuing to engage in economic warfare to put people into debt to control them.
[01:07:40.969 --> 01:07:48.210]  But it's all coming out now, so the old tricks don't work anymore and only enrage the global population to what they're doing.
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:50.639]  Populists are being elected everywhere.
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:56.260]  Globalists are having to try to cancel elections or engage in all sorts of manipulations to even stay in power.
[01:07:56.380 --> 01:08:04.699]  That only wakes people up more in the UK, in Canada, and in Germany with the AFD. There is just so many exciting things.
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:16.899]  And of course, the ultimate comeback story in modern history, President Trump, the American people against the deep state, their whole attempted rollout of the new bird flu hysteria is derailing in front of everyone.
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.680]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:25.039]  But the big World War III issue is still the problem with Ukraine and the things that are happening there.
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:28.760]  But Biden's now announced that they're stopping or cutting back bombing Russia.
[01:08:29.119 --> 01:08:30.699]  Trump's in in 21 days.
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.300]  So pray for peace.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.579]  Pray for the awakening to continue.
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.159]  And pray we can stabilize civilization.
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:37.239]  But it's really starting to happen.
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:40.439]  And the big game changer has really been Trump not backing down.
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:42.220]  The Patriots not backing down.
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:43.439]  Elon Musk coming in.
[01:08:43.739 --> 01:08:47.000]  I'd like to do sex, you know, to really magnify the Great Awakening.
[01:08:47.199 --> 01:08:49.939]  This is an exciting time, so God bless you all, and Happy New Year.
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:53.579]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host of the Alex Jones Show today.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.939]  Alex Jones will be back in studio on Thursday.
[01:08:57.579 --> 01:09:01.199]  I'll be hosting the War Room on Thursday and Friday while Owen is out for vacation.
[01:09:02.039 --> 01:09:06.779]  We will be broadcasting Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:10.680]  Coming into this new year, happy new year to you.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:14.899]  Thank God we're going into a new chapter because the last one has been very taxing.
[01:09:14.979 --> 01:09:28.779]  But in the last segment, we were breaking down how this bird flu really does seem to be, frankly, a conspiracy, a concerted effort, a strategy to inoculate, to vaccinate the populace through the food supply.
[01:09:29.159 --> 01:09:49.840]  They create the shortages in the food supply by burning 200% more poultry farms than have ever burned the four years prior to that, coupled with putting gain of function into this bird flu so that it can spread from flock to flock to flock through mallard ducks,
[01:09:50.039 --> 01:09:54.739]  infecting more chickens so they die of the bird flu.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:10:00.079]  Then the shortage creates the price increase.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.720]  When the supply goes down, the prices go up.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:08.920]  When the prices go up, that creates the public support for ending the shortage.
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:15.560]  The proposed solution to ending the shortage is vaccinating all of the poultry.
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:27.920]  But what they're not going to tell you is that when they vaccinate the poultry, when they open up the legal mechanism to force inoculate all of the food, those vaccines will then be transmissible to you.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.220]  They will inoculate you When you eat the vaccinated food.
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:35.239]  That's why the mRNA technology is so important.
[01:10:36.479 --> 01:10:44.920]  That's why they pushed the mRNA vaccine in 2020. And that's why they're pushing the mRNA vaccines now instead of traditional vaccines.
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:55.760]  Because the mRNA technology allows for these vaccines to spread from host to host.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.300]  To spread from the directly inoculated chicken to you when you eat it.
[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:08.000]  From the directly inoculated cow to you when you eat it.
[01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:14.210]  We're good to go.
[01:11:29.489 --> 01:11:37.590]  To ensure that they will have the same vaccine revenue into the future despite the fact that no one is volunteering to get vaccines anymore.
[01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:40.750]  Certainly not to the same extent as four or five years ago.
[01:11:41.569 --> 01:11:45.210]  They've lost all trust in vaccines because of the tens of millions that they killed.
[01:11:45.369 --> 01:11:54.729]  They developed this mRNA technology and they're using it to inoculate you, guarantee revenues, guarantee that you're sick and unhealthy forever so they can make money off of you time and time and time again.
[01:11:56.369 --> 01:11:57.310]  They want you sick.
[01:11:57.529 --> 01:11:58.609]  They want you stupid.
[01:11:58.890 --> 01:11:59.970]  They want you broke.
[01:12:00.189 --> 01:12:01.310]  And they want you afraid.
[01:12:03.010 --> 01:12:08.789]  Because the weaker you are, the more malleable you become.
[01:12:10.369 --> 01:12:13.069]  And governments love a malleable populace.
[01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:20.289]  They love a population that can come out and say, there are three haircuts that you're allowed to have.
[01:12:20.369 --> 01:12:21.250]  You guys have to look this up.
[01:12:21.369 --> 01:12:22.729]  It's been a long time since I've seen a report on this.
[01:12:23.050 --> 01:12:25.630]  Aren't there three approved haircuts in North Korea?
[01:12:26.899 --> 01:12:28.279]  You can pick one of any of the three.
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:36.140]  They want to control every aspect of your life.
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:38.899]  And here's report after report going years back.
[01:12:39.239 --> 01:12:40.500]  Alex has been talking about this for years.
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:43.819]  How veterinary vaccines affect human health.
[01:12:45.779 --> 01:12:48.899]  Vaccines against diseases transmitted from animals to humans.
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:50.920]  A one health paradigm.
[01:12:51.239 --> 01:12:53.239]  This is another NIH study.
[01:12:54.619 --> 01:12:55.279]  Highlights here.
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:13:00.520]  Three frameworks for development and use of vaccines for control of zoonosis are provided.
[01:13:00.739 --> 01:13:03.899]  Framework 1 vaccines target dead-end human and livestock hosts.
[01:13:04.199 --> 01:13:09.079]  Framework 2 vaccines target infections of domesticated animals as a means of preventing spread to humans.
[01:13:09.359 --> 01:13:12.600]  Framework 3 vaccines target wild animal reservoirs.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.920]  And then, collaboration of animal and human health disciplines.
[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:18.260]  One Health may accelerate new approaches to disease control.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:19.920]  They've done the research.
[01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.100]  I mean, they always document exactly what they're doing.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:25.880]  Vaccinating poultry against avian flu is contributing to spread.
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:28.079]  That's one thing that Brett Weinstein said.
[01:13:28.079 --> 01:13:31.060]  It was in one of his podcast episodes with Joe Rogan, I believe.
[01:13:31.119 --> 01:13:34.260]  He's a famous virologist, very credible, very reputable, very brilliant.
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.359]  He said, you're not supposed to vaccinate.
[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:47.960]  During a pandemic, in the midst of a pandemic, because if you vaccinate in the midst of a pandemic, it creates leaky viruses, which become immune to the vaccines.
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:53.880]  And we saw this happen as soon as they came out with the mRNA vaccines during 2020, and people started to get vaccinated during 2021 especially.
[01:13:55.390 --> 01:14:00.529]  We saw that there were new strands, constantly new strands, new strand after new strand after new strand of this vaccine.
[01:14:00.529 --> 01:14:01.270]  It was pivoting.
[01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:02.409]  It was adapting.
[01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:03.710]  It was mutating.
[01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:08.729]  It was evolving to resist all of the mRNA vaccines, the spike proteins that were targeted.
[01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:11.409]  And that's why they didn't work after like a month.
[01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:30.189]  And so when you're vaccinating this poultry, after you've done gain-of-function research on the bird flu to ensure that it can be transmittable through mallard ducts, You're making something that is hyper-viral.
[01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:33.949]  So it virtually infects every animal on the continent.
[01:14:35.710 --> 01:14:38.010]  You can't quarantine against the vaccine, you see.
[01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:48.149]  And then by using the mRNA technology, they can ensure that not only are they vaccinating these animals, but whoever eats the animals then becomes vaccinated.
[01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:52.750]  I mean, if you can get the COVID-19 virus...
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:57.319]  From a bat!
[01:14:57.939 --> 01:14:59.000]  Which is not what happened.
[01:14:59.199 --> 01:15:02.819]  But if you can get it from a bat, then you can get a vaccine from a bat.
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:11.000]  If you can get HIV in Africa from eating bushmeat, then you can get a vaccine from eating bushmeat.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.460]  If you can get sick from a chicken, then you can get vaccinated from a chicken.
[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:17.380]  Do you understand, folks?
[01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:23.170]  The vaccines are the pandemic.
[01:15:23.489 --> 01:15:25.930]  The vaccines are the public health crisis.
[01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:27.810]  The vaccines are the assault.
[01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:34.590]  This chicken vaccine makes its virus more dangerous.
[01:15:34.789 --> 01:15:38.909]  This is from 2015. We got more here.
[01:15:39.210 --> 01:15:39.989]  Thomas did a great job.
[01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:48.090]  A side effect of the Merrick's disease MD vaccine for chickens is that it can make the disease spread faster and longer than normal.
[01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:52.449]  This is because the vaccine is leaky, meaning it doesn't stop the diseases from replicating or spreading to other chickens.
[01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:57.010]  More reports on Merrick's disease in chickens.
[01:15:58.229 --> 01:16:00.529]  Why do broiler chickens receive vaccinations?
[01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:03.409]  Should we vaccinate against bird flu?
[01:16:03.689 --> 01:16:14.829]  22. This is Reuters.
[01:16:17.449 --> 01:16:18.850]  Okay.
[01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:25.750]  The U.S. considers vaccinating chickens as bird flu kills millions of them.
[01:16:26.010 --> 01:16:43.270]  This is it right here, March 6, 2023, after they committed arson and intentionally burned down enough poultry farms to result in the death of 1.5 million chickens over the course of the last four years compared to only 500,000 chickens the four years prior under the Trump administration.
[01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:56.449]  They are creating an artificial shortage to justify the mass inoculation So they can plant this mRNA technology in the food supply so when you eat it you get vaccinated.
[01:16:57.869 --> 01:17:06.289]  I know many of us over the course of the last several years have taken great comfort in the fact that we have been aware of the negative health effects of this COVID-19 mRNA technology.
[01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:10.930]  We take pride in the fact that we are saying no to boosters.
[01:17:11.069 --> 01:17:15.789]  We are saying no to these vaccines because we understand that they cause things like myocarditis.
[01:17:15.949 --> 01:17:18.329]  That they cause things like aneurysms.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:31.380]  We understand that they cause things like paralysis, death, countless other injuries that have affected millions upon millions and killed many others.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:41.239]  We understand that the vaccines reduce our immune system's efficacy in dealing with other viruses that it's exposed to because our immune system is trained to only respond to specific spike proteins.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:46.060]  And we've been saying, thank God we watched Infowars.
[01:17:46.199 --> 01:17:47.300]  Thank God we listened to Infowars.
[01:17:47.399 --> 01:17:49.260]  Thank God we listened to Alex Jones.
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:52.399]  Thank God we listened to Robert Malone and Peter McCullough and others.
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:57.979]  Because we were not tricked into inoculating ourselves with the death jab.
[01:17:59.159 --> 01:18:04.979]  But now we have quickly arrived at a place where it doesn't matter whether or not you know not to choose the vaccine.
[01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:10.609]  If you can't eat without getting vaccinated.
[01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:12.470]  Okay, you won't get the shot?
[01:18:12.649 --> 01:18:13.510]  Well, are you going to have dinner?
[01:18:15.489 --> 01:18:16.649]  Oh, you don't want to get inoculated?
[01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:17.390]  You're not going to get your booster?
[01:18:17.649 --> 01:18:19.689]  Well, are you going to make a chicken casserole for Thanksgiving?
[01:18:23.649 --> 01:18:25.069]  This is wild, folks.
[01:18:25.829 --> 01:18:27.130]  This is wild.
[01:18:28.689 --> 01:18:44.159]  And I can't emphasize enough that the problem isn't just That against your will, our government can infect and inject your body with experimental medications and vaccines.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:55.560]  But it's because this infrastructure opens up a whole new road for what the government can do to our bodies, our lives.
[01:18:56.180 --> 01:19:10.899]  I mean, John Locke and his second treaties of government made an incredibly compelling, articulate, strong, solid argument For private property rights, beginning with our body.
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:13.779]  I say our body, my body, my rights all the time.
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:21.039]  Arguing that if we are created by God, then our lives and our bodies are our own private property.
[01:19:21.239 --> 01:19:23.359]  And our will is our own private property.
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:27.960]  No one else, no government, no entity has a right to our bodies, to our lives, to our wills.
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:33.640]  Because it was given to us by God and his authority transcends the authority of any man.
[01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:44.689]  And by extension, anything we choose to do with our lives, our time, our minds, our will, and our bodies is also our private property.
[01:19:45.649 --> 01:19:48.270]  So if I work and make money, it becomes my private property.
[01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:50.170]  If I build a house, it becomes my private property.
[01:19:51.770 --> 01:20:03.409]  And that is the foundational argument, the philosophical and theological justification for capitalism itself that led to the greatest progress of any civilization throughout history.
[01:20:04.329 --> 01:20:15.350]  These notions of our private property rights, but now there's a mechanism in place where the government can hack into your body through the food that you eat.
[01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:19.430]  And let's look at the history of this.
[01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:30.569]  I mean, we know that Bill Gates is responsible for the death of thousands, if not millions of people in Africa with his experimental vaccines and the mosquito stuff that he's doing and the poison on the mosquito nets that people were using to fish for food.
[01:20:30.670 --> 01:20:32.430]  And then they were eating the food and then they were getting poisoned.
[01:20:32.729 --> 01:20:35.189]  We know that the Bill Gates's were happy with killing tons of people.
[01:20:35.329 --> 01:20:37.890]  We know that the Tuskegee experiments were devastating.
[01:20:37.909 --> 01:20:41.390]  We know that the polio vaccines in large caused polio.
[01:20:41.489 --> 01:20:45.289]  My dad was vaccinated for polio, then got polio from the polio vaccine when he was a kid.
[01:20:45.409 --> 01:20:47.390]  He was born in 49. Thank God he's okay.
[01:20:49.489 --> 01:20:58.229]  We know because of MKUltra, despite the fact that they burned the documents, we know that through MKUltra, they don't care about your health rights, your health issues.
[01:20:59.010 --> 01:21:08.189]  We know that they were happy to unwittingly drug you with LSD so they could watch you have sex and study your behavior.
[01:21:08.489 --> 01:21:09.989]  That's what they did with MKUltra.
[01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:19.340]  We know that they engineered Ted Kaczynski through MKUltra Ultimately resulting in terrorist acts.
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:20.060]  And there were others too.
[01:21:20.199 --> 01:21:21.899]  I think Lee Harvey Oswald falls into that category.
[01:21:22.159 --> 01:21:24.359]  Charles Manson truly falls into that category.
[01:21:24.539 --> 01:21:25.600]  I mean, there's a meme going around.
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:27.319]  What do all four of these people have in common?
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:28.399]  And it's one psychologist.
[01:21:29.289 --> 01:21:32.369]  These are all famous murderers, terrorists in the United States.
[01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:36.729]  So we know the government is happy to perform these medical experiments on you.
[01:21:36.949 --> 01:21:48.770]  We know that in the 80s, the pharmaceutical companies, with the government being aware, infected 10,000 hemophiliacs with HIV by not telling their parents that the treatment for hemophilia was contaminated.
[01:21:50.189 --> 01:21:53.909]  Their justification was, well, it's better to die of AIDS than hemophilia.
[01:21:55.149 --> 01:22:02.630]  So we might as well just not tell you that you're Guaranteeing the death of your children every time you treat them for an injury or swollen ankle or something like that.
[01:22:04.909 --> 01:22:10.850]  And after Nuremberg and all the criticism of what the Nazis did in these extermination camps.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:26.520]  And all of the new human rights that have been recognized by the international community, all of the crimes against humanity which have been identified, all of the precedents which have been set, our government continues to commit the very same crimes.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.279]  It's a different way.
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:27.979]  It's a different story.
[01:22:28.119 --> 01:22:28.840]  It's a different narrative.
[01:22:29.039 --> 01:22:31.359]  They're not sending you to camps and then inoculating you yet.
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:34.939]  But they're violating all of the same rights.
[01:22:34.939 --> 01:22:38.180]  They're just doing it in a more sophisticated way, a more subtle way.
[01:22:42.939 --> 01:22:45.939]  And they're trying to regulate out any alternative.
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:59.760]  Just like with the artificial intelligence stuff, where the major corporations are lobbying and conspiring with the political class or politicians and other bureaucrats to regulate out anyone else's ability to create competing artificial intelligence tools.
[01:23:00.199 --> 01:23:03.420]  So they can have a monopoly on this weapon of mass destruction.
[01:23:05.970 --> 01:23:10.989]  So they are eradicating and regulating out any alternatives to the food supply they want to control.
[01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:12.649]  I mean, how many thousands of it?
[01:23:12.729 --> 01:23:13.470]  Please look this up, guys.
[01:23:13.829 --> 01:23:20.590]  How many thousands of acres of farmland in the last several years have been purchased by either the CCP or Bill Gates?
[01:23:20.770 --> 01:23:23.090]  I just want to see the number pulled up on the screen when you find it.
[01:23:24.630 --> 01:23:26.569]  They're buying up all the land.
[01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:31.449]  They're regulating out all of the independent farmers, raw milk, raw eggs.
[01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:38.930]  They're declaring states of emergency when there is no emergencies so they can ramp up their regulation even more on this specific industry.
[01:23:39.829 --> 01:23:53.569]  So even if you know that the food at the store is contaminated with these vaccines, you still have to eat and there's nowhere else to get the food unless you use the black market, then they'll find you and all that thing.
[01:23:53.649 --> 01:23:55.170]  There'll be SWAT raids for the chicken that you eat.
[01:23:56.750 --> 01:24:04.109]  But my point is bringing up the MKUltra and the experiments On humanity and going all the way back to what the Nazis did.
[01:24:05.069 --> 01:24:09.250]  My point is, it's not just going to be the vaccines that they use this for.
[01:24:09.409 --> 01:24:19.130]  Once they prove this mRNA technology, once they prove that they can infect humans through the food supply subtly, then they start with the experimental stuff.
[01:24:19.489 --> 01:24:21.210]  Then they start with the bioweapons.
[01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:31.869]  Then they start with, alright, how about this mRNA vaccine, which we know causes this type of lung cancer in four years from exposure to this mRNA technology.
[01:24:33.909 --> 01:24:37.810]  And in the next four years, we're going to develop a treatment for that type of lung cancer.
[01:24:38.329 --> 01:24:41.069]  So they give everyone lung cancer, and then they treat it.
[01:24:42.489 --> 01:24:45.630]  And the health insurance companies pay for it, and the premiums go up.
[01:24:46.329 --> 01:24:50.909]  And when it becomes more affordable to you, you ask for more government assistance, and it's a downward spiral.
[01:24:52.300 --> 01:25:02.720]  All right, what about this form of brain cancer from this type of mRNA that affects 10% of the population within 10 years of exposure?
[01:25:03.659 --> 01:25:05.640]  Then they develop the treatments for the brain cancer.
[01:25:05.739 --> 01:25:06.319]  You see how this works?
[01:25:08.239 --> 01:25:13.380]  They create the problem so they can usher in the desired solution.
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:19.560]  What does Alex Jones call that?
[01:25:20.739 --> 01:25:21.699]  Something paradigm?
[01:25:24.850 --> 01:25:39.649]  It's exactly what they did with the Patriot Act, where they allowed 9-11 to happen in order to usher in the New World Order through the Patriot Act and mass surveillance on the people, mass control of information, mass violation of all of our rights.
[01:25:43.489 --> 01:25:50.130]  The same thing they did with every false flag event in the Gulf of Tolkien through 9-11, even Pearl Harbor, I think, at this point.
[01:25:51.649 --> 01:25:56.789]  They want the crisis to happen, and if there is no crisis, they just manufacture one.
[01:25:58.090 --> 01:26:01.770]  Most of the time, it's more convenient for them to just let something they know is going to happen happen.
[01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:03.789]  It's more organic, it's more natural that way.
[01:26:03.850 --> 01:26:06.890]  That way you can still get the same outcome with the least amount of lying.
[01:26:07.989 --> 01:26:18.130]  But when there's nothing about to happen, then they start doing things to try to catalyze it, like opening up the border and allowing tens of millions of people into the United States of America, hundreds of thousands of them from terrorist organizations.
[01:26:20.319 --> 01:26:28.859]  A minimum of a thousand known members of Al-Qaeda are operating in the United States as we speak because they just simply want a terrorist attack to happen.
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:30.979]  Because every time it happens, they get more powerful.
[01:26:30.979 --> 01:26:31.979]  They get more funding.
[01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:33.000]  They get more support.
[01:26:33.199 --> 01:26:35.460]  They get more justification to go to war after war after war.
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:38.020]  And remember, folks, we don't want to win wars anymore.
[01:26:38.159 --> 01:26:40.119]  The age of winning and losing wars is over.
[01:26:40.279 --> 01:26:41.659]  We just want to wage them.
[01:26:42.239 --> 01:26:44.520]  We are no longer at war with Eurasia.
[01:26:45.869 --> 01:26:57.649]  And one of the crucial flaws of the book Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, kind of sister book to 1984, the other side of the coin of dystopia.
[01:26:58.770 --> 01:27:02.489]  One of the crucial flaws in that book is you remember the element of Soma?
[01:27:03.029 --> 01:27:16.949]  If you were unhappy with your life, if you were unhappy with The human condition, the role that you had, the place that you lived, anything that was going on in this hyper-controlled civilization, there was a pill you could take called Soma that would just make you feel better.
[01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:21.050]  You could voluntarily take this pill anytime you felt down, and everything would be okay.
[01:27:21.210 --> 01:27:24.609]  That was Aldous Huxley's brilliant observation in Brave New World.
[01:27:24.689 --> 01:27:25.829]  But here's the problem, folks.
[01:27:26.569 --> 01:27:30.750]  In that story, protagonist wakes up.
[01:27:31.819 --> 01:27:39.560]  In the movie Equilibrium, the protagonist wakes up and stops voluntarily taking the SOMA or the injection that reduces your emotions.
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:44.619]  In The Giver, when somebody wakes up, they stop taking the emotion-reducing pills.
[01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:50.819]  And it undermines the integrity of the dystopian subjugation.
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:57.560]  In Brave New World, in Equilibrium, in The Matrix, if you voluntarily take the red pill, if you voluntarily take...
[01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.869]  The blue pill.
[01:27:59.069 --> 01:28:18.960]  If you voluntarily take Soma, if you voluntarily inject yourself with emotion-reducing psychotic drugs in these dystopian science fictions, It works, but as soon as you stop voluntarily doing it, then the heroes of these stories rise up and undermine the whole entire system that has been set up and it falls apart.
[01:28:19.079 --> 01:28:29.739]  So they realize they cannot count on you to make a decision for subjugation because inherently as human beings, we desire nothing more than freedom because it is the first thing given to us by God at birth.
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:34.119]  It's the first thing to be taken from us at birth.
[01:28:35.689 --> 01:28:46.949]  Well, if you won't choose the soma, if you won't choose the injection, if you won't choose the blue pill, then we'll find a way to get it inside of you without you even knowing.
[01:28:48.750 --> 01:29:03.210]  And they're using this bird flu, these artificial shortages to justify the inoculation, not just of poultry folks, the inoculation of the populace with whatever they want, whenever they want, forever.
[01:29:03.569 --> 01:29:12.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, because of your support in the last 30 years, My operation has successfully devastated the globalists.
[01:29:12.939 --> 01:29:24.840]  The enemies of freedom worldwide openly give us the credit for being the genesis point for the mass global awakening to the new world order that is happening right now.
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:31.359]  So ladies and gentlemen, as we go into Christmas 2024, And the globalists are fighting as hard as they can to shut us down.
[01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:39.060]  I want to thank you for your past support and I want to encourage you now to support the broadcast while getting great products because we're winning.
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:41.619]  We're turning the tide and I don't want to give up.
[01:29:41.739 --> 01:29:42.699]  I don't want to back down.
[01:29:42.899 --> 01:29:48.520]  I know my most important work and my crew's most important work is still to come.
[01:29:48.739 --> 01:29:50.779]  The people of the planet are waking up.
[01:29:50.939 --> 01:29:52.960]  Now they're really ready to hear the truth.
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:55.220]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:58.260]  I want you all to have a fabulous Christmas coming up.
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:05.760]  And I want to encourage all of you to really think about what's happening around the world and ask yourselves, do we want to keep Alex Jones on the air?
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:10.579]  And do we want to get great products that enrich and empower our lives at the same time?
[01:30:11.279 --> 01:30:12.659]  Please go now.
[01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:31.270]  To thealexjonesstore.com and get some of the very best products, some of the very best supplements, and a lot of fun stuff like an Alex Jones 2025 calendar or a limited edition 2024 Trump victory map or this little baby.
[01:30:31.489 --> 01:30:33.170]  Oh, the Trump victory map.
[01:30:45.139 --> 01:30:47.800]  I want to thank you all for your past support.
[01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:54.140]  This victory you're seeing is because of you and you never backing down and never giving up.
[01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:57.899]  But now is the critical part of the fight and we need your support.
[01:30:58.060 --> 01:30:59.220]  Plus, these are great products.
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:02.760]  Please go to thealexjonesstore.com and keep us on the air.
[01:31:03.719 --> 01:31:07.119]  James O'Keefe here in North Philadelphia on 5th Street.
[01:31:07.359 --> 01:31:13.060]  Right here is the Philadelphia City Commissioner's Office the day before Election Day.
[01:31:13.159 --> 01:31:17.359]  And across the street is an NGO called Saiba.
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:18.659]  That's Saiba.
[01:31:19.229 --> 01:31:21.829]  And they are telling people to vote.
[01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:32.729]  They are telling people that all you need is what's called a tin number, that's i-tin number, and you can vote if you're not a citizen of the United States.
[01:31:32.970 --> 01:31:45.930]  So we sent an undercover reporter to this NGO right across from the place where people are early voting, and she got confirmation that, yes, in fact, she can vote with nothing but an i-tin number.
[01:31:54.540 --> 01:32:04.100]  And then we went into the city commissioner's office to speak to the man who works there, working for the city government, confirming that you only need to be a resident of Philadelphia.
[01:32:04.619 --> 01:32:08.039]  But when I say resident, that means of the entire United States.
[01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:10.000]  But you're just worried about...
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.340]  Oh, you don't care about anything else.
[01:32:12.439 --> 01:32:14.039]  You just want them to have a resident...
[01:32:23.359 --> 01:32:25.760]  Obviously it's extremely loud here.
[01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.779]  Music is very loud.
[01:32:28.199 --> 01:32:32.520]  So we're going to go ahead and walk across the street and talk to these people.
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:39.020]  Are you Juliesa?
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.079]  Are you Juliesa?
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:55.119]  And these people over here across the street are saying that you can vote if you have an I-10 number.
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:57.340]  This is the document that they gave us.
[01:32:57.619 --> 01:33:02.279]  Once again, I cannot comment because I don't know, no idea.
[01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:17.210]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.409 --> 01:33:19.909]  I am your host, Chase Geyser.
[01:33:19.989 --> 01:33:22.289]  Follow me on X at RealChaseGeyser.
[01:33:22.409 --> 01:33:24.109]  Follow Alex Jones at RealAlexJones.
[01:33:24.109 --> 01:33:26.170]  Make sure you go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:33:26.329 --> 01:33:31.789]  And make sure you follow at AJNLive or bookmark AlexJones.network.
[01:33:31.829 --> 01:33:41.130]  In case we are shut down this month, it is imperative that you know where the backup operation is, where the escape pod is, because we will stay on the air without a hiccup.
[01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:49.229]  Many of you may recall, many of you may not know, but we were thrown out of this building some weeks ago.
[01:33:49.770 --> 01:33:51.529]  There was an auction.
[01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:53.909]  It was fraudulent.
[01:33:54.909 --> 01:34:01.010]  And for 24 hours, we were not allowed in this building.
[01:34:01.130 --> 01:34:10.029]  We were allowed in the building to get our personal belongings and things of that nature, but we were not allowed to use any of the Infowars infrastructure to broadcast.
[01:34:11.329 --> 01:34:13.890]  Because the federal government had determined that it no longer belonged to us.
[01:34:14.029 --> 01:34:15.130]  So we had no right.
[01:34:17.770 --> 01:34:22.770]  And we got news that this was happening at 7.35 the morning of.
[01:34:23.329 --> 01:34:28.430]  We went on the air anyway for about two and a half hours with Alex and Harrison.
[01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:37.710]  Then when they pulled the plug, quite literally pulled the plug, we immediately drove to the backup operation and the Alex Jones show began.
[01:34:39.649 --> 01:34:41.210]  On time that day.
[01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:52.989]  They shut us down and we were on air the same day, on time, with millions upon millions of listeners, record sales from the backup operation on all the same radio stations.
[01:34:54.810 --> 01:35:01.630]  Now we could be shut down again, depending on how some of these court hearings pan out in the coming weeks.
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:07.520]  And in the event that that happens, we will be on air from this backup operation.
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:13.060]  So follow at AJNLive, bookmark AlexJones.network, the website.
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:19.260]  That will be the new home of the Infowar if things go straight to hell.
[01:35:22.319 --> 01:35:25.359]  And the AlexJonesStore.com is not owned by Infowars.
[01:35:25.479 --> 01:35:26.359]  We partnered with Bigly.
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:27.260]  They've been American heroes.
[01:35:28.350 --> 01:35:29.850]  We've got better shirts than we've ever had.
[01:35:29.970 --> 01:35:31.489]  We've got better supplements than we've ever had.
[01:35:31.630 --> 01:35:33.170]  We've got better deals than we've ever had.
[01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:35.250]  We've got an affiliate program now.
[01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:38.529]  We've got the VIP program now, which you pay $30 a month, cancel any time.
[01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:39.789]  You get $40 in store credit.
[01:35:39.909 --> 01:35:40.430]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:35:42.289 --> 01:35:46.810]  That will be our lifeblood, no matter what happens.
[01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:56.090]  So if you hear news that Infowars is being shut down and you're afraid that if you purchase anything at the alexjonesstore.com that it will go to the enemy, that's simply not going to be the case.
[01:35:56.289 --> 01:36:02.289]  This is the number one, most important, best way that you can support Alex Jones, this crew, and this operation.
[01:36:03.329 --> 01:36:06.989]  And since I'm talking about it, I am going to plug a little bit just for a second, then we're going to get back in the news and clips.
[01:36:10.529 --> 01:36:18.220]  There are Three incredible ways, and I'll list them in order of my preference, that you can support us.
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:30.359]  The most important way that you can support us is by going to thealexjonesstore.com slash VIP, or going simply to thealexjonesstore.com and clicking on the VIP option under Alex's Picks.
[01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:36.810]  And opting in to pay the $30 a month for $40 in store credit.
[01:36:36.949 --> 01:36:39.310]  Like I said, you can cancel anytime, but it's not just that.
[01:36:39.369 --> 01:36:40.250]  You get special deals.
[01:36:40.489 --> 01:36:42.229]  You get special perks.
[01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:43.970]  You get special gifts.
[01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:46.949]  You get more entries in our giveaways.
[01:36:47.550 --> 01:37:06.609]  Our giveaway for this new Ford F-250 truck ends on January 8th, and we haven't been talking about it much because We try to focus on breaking news in World War III and all the real problems, and it's hard to talk about an awesome truck right after you talk about the fact that the world's about to end and the government's trying to mass inoculate the populace through the food supply.
[01:37:07.529 --> 01:37:13.609]  The giveaway does end, and if you sign up as a VIP, every purchase you make will get you more entries in to win.
[01:37:13.670 --> 01:37:21.289]  Every dollar you spend gets you five or 10 or 15 sometimes entries, depending on what promo is running, in the raffle to win this truck.
[01:37:22.039 --> 01:37:24.079]  We had an amazing winner for the first truck.
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:28.119]  Came in studio, was just great to be with, great to speak with.
[01:37:29.899 --> 01:37:32.279]  Awesome at communicating the message, sharing his story.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:38.039]  And we will be announcing another winner for this truck within a few weeks of the giveaway ending on the 8th.
[01:37:38.119 --> 01:37:45.520]  Now, after the giveaway ends, because of certain state laws around raffles and giveaways, we have to allow a couple of weeks for people who may have mailed in their entries.
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:47.420]  We have to legally accept mail-in entries.
[01:37:48.699 --> 01:37:52.100]  And so we will announce, I think, at the end of January, beginning of February, who the winner is.
[01:37:52.420 --> 01:38:07.039]  So that's the number one way that you can support Alex Jones, this crew, this operation, this truth, freedom of speech, humanity, is by going to the alexjonesstore.com slash VIP, signing up for $30 a month, and then using all the advantages and perks as a VIP to get our supplements and our merch.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:14.699]  Now, the second best way that you can support us is by getting what is our most popular product.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:17.359]  Now, when we first ran...
[01:38:18.610 --> 01:38:19.869]  We've announced, launched this product.
[01:38:19.989 --> 01:38:23.189]  This is the Ultimate CMOS Gummies with bladderwrack and burdock root.
[01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:26.270]  We sold out within like three days.
[01:38:26.449 --> 01:38:28.850]  I think we had 10,000 bottles and we sold out in like three days.
[01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:35.130]  So we have ordered 30,000 bottles of the Ultimate CMOS Gummies.
[01:38:35.210 --> 01:38:37.890]  You can get them for up to 50% off if you buy three at a time.
[01:38:38.819 --> 01:38:45.340]  The more you buy, the better the deals become, plus the discounts, benefits, entries, and things of that nature for your VIP. This product is absolutely amazing.
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:51.779]  We have people call in all the time and say how much they loved Survival Shield X2, how much they loved Survival Shield X3 at the Infowar store.
[01:38:52.319 --> 01:38:55.260]  Because we know the benefits of iodine are astounding.
[01:38:55.359 --> 01:39:05.399]  We know that even globalist institutions like the WHO and the CDC say that iodine deficiency is a leading health crisis in the world.
[01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:10.590]  If you don't have enough iodine in your system, it impacts things like your IQ, your cognitive functioning.
[01:39:10.609 --> 01:39:12.970]  It's why they iodized a lot of the salt in the United States.
[01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:17.010]  But it also makes your immune system weaker.
[01:39:17.170 --> 01:39:29.770]  You're more likely to die of bird flu if you have an iodine deficiency because your thyroid is unable to detoxify your body from pathogens, viruses, bacteria, infections, toxins in the water, the food, the air, between chemtrails, fluoride, atrazine.
[01:39:31.229 --> 01:39:36.170]  And everything they're putting in the food, preservatives, things of that nature, I mean, it's more important now than ever that your thyroid can detox.
[01:39:36.329 --> 01:39:39.989]  And so by taking Ultimate CMOS gummies, two of them a day, they're delicious.
[01:39:39.989 --> 01:39:42.789]  I would take them even if there was no iodine in them because it's like candy.
[01:39:42.949 --> 01:39:46.449]  I have to tell my kids to stop eating these.
[01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:47.069]  They're so delicious.
[01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:52.130]  By taking two of these a day, you are getting all of the iodine that you need and so much more.
[01:39:52.289 --> 01:40:00.649]  And it's actually bioavailable so that your body can stand up to the assault that it faces in our environment because our government is manipulating everything that you come in contact with.
[01:40:02.439 --> 01:40:06.720]  The third way that you can support us is by getting the ultimate turmeric gummies.
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:10.720]  Many of our listeners loved bodies.
[01:40:11.279 --> 01:40:12.880]  That turmeric was very powerful.
[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:14.720]  We sold it on the Infowars store for a long time.
[01:40:15.199 --> 01:40:19.880]  Ultimate turmeric gummies are a great way to have the same effects of bodies.
[01:40:20.039 --> 01:40:23.060]  This helps with things like inflammation, even your metabolism.
[01:40:24.199 --> 01:40:27.319]  It's got ginger root and black pepper extract in it for bioavailability.
[01:40:27.479 --> 01:40:42.840]  Again, most competitors, whether it's sea moss, whether it's multivitamins, whether it's turmeric, whether it's any supplement that you could take, any vitamin or mineral that you could take, most competitors, they give you the vitamin or the mineral, but they don't give you the other ingredients that make your body actually able to absorb it.
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:44.359]  So you take these multivitamins like a...
[01:40:44.819 --> 01:40:49.840]  I'm not going to name a specific competitor, but a generic men's multivitamin, and you urinate it out that day.
[01:40:49.979 --> 01:40:52.479]  Your body only absorbs 10% of it, 20% of it, maybe.
[01:40:52.819 --> 01:41:04.000]  But with these ingredients that we have added to these supplements, Ultimate Turmeric, Ultimate CMOS, others that we sell, it ensures that your body can absorb as much of these benefits as possible.
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:06.340]  So if you want to help with inflammation, your metabolism...
[01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:08.020]  Digestion.
[01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:10.460]  Get the ultimate turmeric with ginger root and black pepper.
[01:41:10.619 --> 01:41:13.619]  These gummies are delicious as well at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:18.399]  Get the ultimate sea moss with bladderwrack and burdock root for that iodine and immune support.
[01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:19.359]  Plus, it's delicious.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:20.899]  Keeps us on the air.

[01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:02.270]  All right, folks.
[01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:03.130]  Now, I've done my plug.
[01:42:08.069 --> 01:42:09.010]  Let's get back into this.
[01:42:10.210 --> 01:42:15.869]  I showed you a clip at the beginning of the segment that was James O'Keefe exposing the election fraud that took place.
[01:42:16.090 --> 01:42:20.050]  And I know that we're all excited and happy that we won this election on November 5th.
[01:42:21.449 --> 01:42:38.140]  The only mistake I think that we've made since then is we have disregarded the fact that there was the same amount, if not a greater amount of election fraud that took place in 2024 than there was even in 2020. We won,
[01:42:38.279 --> 01:42:38.699]  so who cares?
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:39.159]  We won.
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:40.000]  It was too big to rig.
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:45.539]  But if you look at the details, there were hundreds of thousands of ballots that came in in Detroit at 4 a.m.
[01:42:45.539 --> 01:42:46.380]  It just wasn't enough.
[01:42:48.779 --> 01:42:51.560]  As of last week, they were still counting votes in California.
[01:42:51.699 --> 01:42:57.680]  We have the Krasensteins coming out and saying, ha-ha, Trump did not win the popular vote because the official tally is 49.9%.
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:59.800]  So most people actually didn't vote for him.
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:00.779]  They voted for someone else.
[01:43:00.979 --> 01:43:03.439]  More people voted for him than they voted for Kamala Harris.
[01:43:03.619 --> 01:43:09.500]  But if you add up the RFK Jr. votes, if you add up the other votes, the Libertarian votes and the Green Party votes.
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:11.300]  Yeah, yeah, Donald Trump did not get the majority of the votes.
[01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:12.819]  It's because of the election fraud, folks.
[01:43:15.279 --> 01:43:19.300]  Not to mention the fact that they forced RFK unwillingly to be on the ballot in several states.
[01:43:19.539 --> 01:43:20.680]  Didn't even want to be on the ballot.
[01:43:20.739 --> 01:43:21.819]  They said, no, sorry, it's not up to you.
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:23.260]  If the people want to vote for you, they can vote for you.
[01:43:25.279 --> 01:43:26.140]  Rampant election fraud.
[01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:32.859]  And this election fraud does not just apply to our presidential elections, but it applies to the down-ballot elections as well.
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:39.159]  I think?
[01:44:05.159 --> 01:44:11.960]  California is disproportionately represented in our federal government illegally more than it should be because of this element of fraud.
[01:44:12.239 --> 01:44:17.220]  It's not even about getting these illegal migrants to vote for Democrats.
[01:44:17.439 --> 01:44:20.159]  Yes, that's part of their strategy, 100% part of their strategy.
[01:44:20.359 --> 01:44:31.100]  But they actually want these illegal migrants sent from Republican states to leftist strongholds so they can ensure that the leftist states have more representatives in the federal government after every census.
[01:44:34.239 --> 01:44:46.640]  And then they leverage that power to manipulate the politics and policies of the United States government in favor of leftism, socialism, Marxism, communism, globalism into the future.
[01:44:46.819 --> 01:45:08.090]  And that's why we have problems like we're facing now, with rampant healthcare increases, with rampant inflation, with states of emergency being declared around fake bird flus, with gain-of-function research being done to spread these bird flus, with the Overt and covert culling of herds to create artificial shortages of poultry.
[01:45:08.329 --> 01:45:21.590]  So the prices go up, so they can justify inoculating all of our food supply with experimental mRNA vaccines, which can then transmit from the original host to whoever consumes the food.
[01:45:26.529 --> 01:45:32.970]  The reason I bring all this up is because we have to remember That we have not won a war.
[01:45:33.229 --> 01:45:34.329]  We have started one.
[01:45:34.689 --> 01:45:35.930]  We have won a battle.
[01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:38.970]  But the new world order is attacking at full force.
[01:45:39.170 --> 01:45:43.729]  We have to remember that we have just begun to fight and so is the enemy.
[01:45:43.949 --> 01:45:45.210]  They have only begun to fight.
[01:45:46.210 --> 01:45:55.180]  We have to remember that it's not time for us to sit back and watch as Trump trolls or Musk trolls Or RFK Jr. says some things that we agree with.
[01:45:55.779 --> 01:45:59.199]  Vivek Ramaswamy talks about the Department of Government efficiency in a way that we like.
[01:45:59.359 --> 01:46:02.800]  We have to remember that it's not over, folks.
[01:46:03.119 --> 01:46:08.359]  It's not like we've passed the ball to Michael Jordan and he's just going to carry the rest of the game.
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:10.560]  We need to keep getting the rebounds.
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:11.439]  We need to keep fighting.
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:12.539]  We need to keep playing defense.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:13.619]  We need to keep playing offense.
[01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:20.000]  We need to be more aggressive now than ever because our aggression is the reason that we were victorious on November 5th.
[01:46:20.989 --> 01:46:25.909]  But our aggression has provoked an information war on a scale never before seen.
[01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:32.850]  An escalation of this information war, this ultimate human battle between good and evil.
[01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:40.130]  We have to apply pressure to our local leaders, to our state leaders.
[01:46:40.350 --> 01:46:41.930]  We have to wake people up more than ever.
[01:46:41.989 --> 01:46:43.250]  We have to campaign like hell.
[01:46:43.489 --> 01:46:46.449]  We have to pretend that Trump lost and bust ass.
[01:46:48.159 --> 01:46:54.899]  We have to support Infowars and Alex Jones and share the broadcast and retweet and repost and subscribe to them on X and subscribe for the VIP club.
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:56.319]  Buy the supplements.
[01:46:56.619 --> 01:46:57.739]  Fight for our freedoms.
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:58.779]  Fight for our health.
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:00.479]  Reclaim our lives.
[01:47:00.659 --> 01:47:17.539]  While Canada can run ad after ad after ad featuring white people celebrating their life just before they engage in physician-assisted suicide,
[01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:20.979]  We have to say no.
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:34.199]  We don't agree with the notion that human beings in conjunction with their governments are supposed to choose death.
[01:47:36.079 --> 01:47:39.100]  We are called to choose life.
[01:47:41.170 --> 01:47:43.569]  And that's why they're trying to subvert us every step of the way.
[01:47:43.869 --> 01:47:48.229]  They want us dying, not necessarily dead yet, but they do love depopulation.
[01:47:48.430 --> 01:47:51.430]  They want us dying because, man, they make a hell of a lot of money when we're dying.
[01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:55.449]  Is it like 60% of all healthcare costs are in the last 90 days of life?
[01:47:56.130 --> 01:47:57.310]  Something like that's astronomical.
[01:47:59.439 --> 01:48:08.060]  And that's why they are trying to establish the infrastructure to inoculate us through the food supply without us even knowing it.
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:09.479]  They got it straight from Longshanks.
[01:48:09.579 --> 01:48:10.840]  I'm gonna show this clip from Braveheart.
[01:48:11.399 --> 01:48:13.479]  You may remember Longshanks.
[01:48:14.479 --> 01:48:27.000]  Saying that the problem with Scotland is that it's filled with Scots, and so what we have to do is institute an ancient custom, prima nocta, where we, the British, go in and sleep with all women on the night of their marriage to ensure that their children are half British, and we will breed out the Scots.
[01:48:27.119 --> 01:48:30.579]  They're trying to breed out patriots in this country.
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:31.880]  They don't want you having children.
[01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:38.460]  They're very pleased that the fertility rate is 1.64 or 1.71 in the United States of America.
[01:48:38.619 --> 01:48:40.460]  2.1 is necessary for replacement.
[01:48:41.359 --> 01:49:08.939]  They want you not having enough children so your western culture, your values, your philosophy, your civilization, your theology is slowly eroded like a rock against the ocean over the course of the coming decades while they import migrants to the tune of tens of millions into this country to replace you so there isn't a labor shortage so they can still fund the money machine.
[01:49:10.130 --> 01:49:12.449]  They're trying to breed you out.
[01:49:12.989 --> 01:49:15.069]  And it's not just the policies that are doing it.
[01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:18.710]  It's not just the inflation that causes people to have fewer children they're using to do this.
[01:49:18.789 --> 01:49:23.810]  It's not just the open borders that catalyze the invasion of the replacement culture that allows them to do this.
[01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:32.130]  But it's things like creating mRNA technology that can infect our entire food supply, and then they can drug you with whatever they want.
[01:49:33.050 --> 01:49:37.789]  They can harm you in any way that they want without you even knowing until it's too late.
[01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:39.649]  Late in onset symptoms.
[01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:42.670]  Let's watch this clip from Braveheart.
[01:49:42.750 --> 01:49:44.409]  It's exactly what's happening in the United States.
[01:49:47.869 --> 01:49:52.210]  The trouble with Scotland is that it's full of Scots.
[01:49:57.029 --> 01:50:01.810]  Perhaps the time has come to reinstitute an old custom.
[01:50:02.590 --> 01:50:05.510]  Grant them prima nocte.
[01:50:08.050 --> 01:50:18.930]  First night, When any common girl inhabiting their lands is married, our nobles shall have sexual rights to her on the night of her wedding.
[01:50:21.329 --> 01:50:25.250]  If we can't get them out, we'll feed.
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:30.439]  Folks, you've heard Alex say this.
[01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:33.500]  You've heard Alex describe these jabs, these mandates as rape.
[01:50:33.659 --> 01:50:37.060]  They're raping you, they're raping your children, they're raping your parents, they're raping your grandparents.
[01:50:37.319 --> 01:50:43.260]  They're raping you when they're forcing you to have something in your body that you don't want in your body, but now they're not even forcing it, they're just tricking you.
[01:50:43.399 --> 01:50:45.060]  It's just sly through the food supply.
[01:50:45.199 --> 01:50:46.979]  We have a report from Alex Jones.
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:50.560]  I'm gonna play this and then tell you about our guest Robert Malone coming up at the top of the hour.
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:52.720]  Let's go to what Alex has to say.
[01:50:54.149 --> 01:51:10.069]  A month ago in Romania, Colleen Georgescu, who I've been covering for over a decade, a former high-level UN diplomat who was exposing global government, human sex trafficking by the UN, by NATO, who was anti-war, pro-Western,
[01:51:10.130 --> 01:51:13.890]  but also not anti-Russian, won the election.
[01:51:14.210 --> 01:51:20.989]  And then the corporate media, NATO, came out and said, oh, Russian TV was seen by Romanians.
[01:51:21.739 --> 01:51:22.899]  It's Russian disinfo.
[01:51:23.119 --> 01:51:24.539]  We want the election suspended.
[01:51:24.539 --> 01:51:31.619]  So the Supreme Court, at the best of the security services run by NATO, where they've got NATO troops quartered, suspended the election.
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:36.479]  Well, they officially, just a few hours ago, overturned it and said, you are not the president.
[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:38.960]  And now they have the puppet...
[01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:44.340]  Individual in power who's openly making fun of the Romanian people.
[01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:49.060]  So this is an open NATO coup that we warned about months before it even happened.
[01:51:49.079 --> 01:51:53.859]  We said if the election went to populists that were anti-war, expect a NATO coup.
[01:51:54.119 --> 01:52:00.720]  And then, of course, Romania is part of NATO. And then that new government can claim that Russia has done something to Romania.
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:05.319]  And that will invoke the defense pack that countries in NATO have today.
[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:23.399]  We're good to go.
[01:52:23.399 --> 01:52:28.420]  We're good to go.
[01:52:34.449 --> 01:52:40.670]  Now official, 21 days before Trump gets into office and they're trying to use Romania as a detonator for wider war.
[01:52:40.810 --> 01:52:41.729]  I mean, this is the tyranny.
[01:52:41.810 --> 01:52:44.789]  But look, the EU was set up in 56 under a steel cooperative.
[01:52:44.989 --> 01:52:46.109]  It's an unelected commission.
[01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:52.270]  Then they got the governments to join the EU over the next few decades, up until 2000, and waive their rights to it.
[01:52:52.409 --> 01:52:53.810]  They have a ceremonial...
[01:52:55.649 --> 01:53:03.489]  You know, congress or parliament, and they're elected, but they're only ceremonial in the EU parliament.
[01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:05.729]  So the EU is tyrannical.
[01:53:05.970 --> 01:53:07.510]  It was a brainchild of the Nazis.
[01:53:07.510 --> 01:53:09.109]  If you actually look it up, they've been successful.
[01:53:09.229 --> 01:53:11.250]  They were going to set up their EU. So this is crazy.
[01:53:30.019 --> 01:53:38.920]  Oh, and there's one more point I forgot to make about this publicly run coup in Romania against the voters of the country.
[01:53:39.079 --> 01:53:40.560]  This is just out in the open.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:52.180]  Look at what Zelensky's done canceling the election last year in Ukraine and outlawing all the other political parties, even ones that agree with them and taking over all the media and banning Orthodox Church.
[01:53:52.399 --> 01:53:53.739]  Who runs him?
[01:53:53.859 --> 01:54:00.119]  NATO. Well, who runs NATO? The globalists that run America who stole the election in 2020 and have been trying to block Trump.
[01:54:00.279 --> 01:54:06.000]  And now Jamie Raskin, the Democrats are openly in Congress trying to block his certification in six days on January 6th.
[01:54:06.619 --> 01:54:10.619]  They're not gonna get away with it probably, but they're still trying as much as they can.
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:11.840]  That's the tyrants.
[01:54:11.979 --> 01:54:12.760]  That's the bad guys.
[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:14.659]  That's the ones attacking quote democracy.
[01:54:15.359 --> 01:54:16.399]  All out in the open.
[01:54:16.619 --> 01:54:17.359]  It's insane.
[01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:21.779]  Alright folks, we've got Dr. Robert W. Malone joining us at 6 after.
[01:54:21.939 --> 01:54:22.460]  Top of the hour.
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:23.619]  We're going to a break in one minute.
[01:54:23.619 --> 01:54:26.159]  We've got a report or two that we're going to run in the first five.
[01:54:26.619 --> 01:54:37.640]  And then when more radio stations pick us up at 6 after the hour, we're going to start with Robert W. Malone, the original inventor of mRNA and DNA vaccination technologies, 1989, with nine issued patents.
[01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:54.359]  We're good to go.
[01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:08.399]  Designing and providing oversight of approximately 40 phase 1 clinical trials and 20 phase 2 clinical trials, as well as 5 phase 3 clinical trials.
[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:11.600]  You'll be joining us at 6 after Dr. Robert Malone.
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:12.319]  You've seen him before.
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:13.140]  He's famous.
[01:55:13.199 --> 01:55:14.020]  He's an American hero.
[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:21.800]  He is speaking truth in the face of all of the lies of the New World Order, all of the salts of the New World Order on our hells, our bodies, our freedoms, everything.
[01:55:21.979 --> 01:55:23.680]  Stay tuned for more on the other side.
[01:55:31.930 --> 01:55:39.689]  I've got a very simple but important, powerful, and completely truthful proposal for you.

[01:57:16.590 --> 01:57:19.829]  So here's what Irish sea moss does, according to ChatGPT.
[01:57:20.029 --> 01:57:21.529]  Rich in nutrients.

[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:40.920]  That's just the sea moss.
[01:57:41.319 --> 01:57:42.420]  Now let's look at bladder rack.
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:43.699]  Thyroid support.
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.100]  Anti-inflammatory.
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:46.220]  Digestive aid.
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:47.300]  Rich in antioxidants.
[01:57:47.739 --> 01:57:48.579]  Skin health.
[01:57:48.819 --> 01:57:50.020]  Weight management.
[01:57:50.439 --> 01:57:51.079]  Joint support.
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:53.779]  Improves vision and so much more.
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:55.140]  Now let's look at burdock root.

[01:59:23.689 --> 01:59:39.050]  Look, when you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball, the Lady Gaga, the Justin Bieber, you know, who gives you these carbon tax messages, they tell your kids they gotta love Justin Bieber, and then Bieber says, hand in your guns,
[01:59:39.289 --> 01:59:41.789]  pass the Cybersecurity Act, and...
[01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:57.520]  The police state's good, and then your children are turned into mindless vassals who now, they look up to some twit instead of looking up to Thomas Jefferson, or looking up to Nikola Tesla, or looking up to Magellan.
[01:59:57.859 --> 02:00:00.140]  I mean, kids, Magellan's a lot cooler!
[02:00:00.170 --> 02:00:01.989]  Cooler than Justin Bieber.
[02:00:02.130 --> 02:00:06.750]  He circumnavigated with one ship the entire planet.
[02:00:07.069 --> 02:00:10.649]  He was killed by wild natives before they got back to Portugal.
[02:00:10.649 --> 02:00:19.449]  And when they got back, there was only like 11 people alive of the 200 and something crew, and the entire ship was rotting down to the waterline.
[02:00:19.670 --> 02:00:20.949]  That's destiny.
[02:00:21.149 --> 02:00:21.890]  That's will.
[02:00:22.229 --> 02:00:23.529]  That's striving.
[02:00:23.810 --> 02:00:27.409]  That's being a trailblazer, an explorer, going into space.
[02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:30.720]  Mathematics, quantum mechanics, the secrets of the universe.
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:31.779]  It's all there.
[02:00:31.979 --> 02:00:33.760]  Life is fiery with its beauty.
[02:00:33.899 --> 02:00:35.460]  It's incredible detail.
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:36.859]  Tuning into it.
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:40.420]  They want to shudder your mind talking about Justin Bieber.
[02:00:41.899 --> 02:00:43.300]  It's pure evil.
[02:00:43.659 --> 02:00:48.300]  They're taking your intellect and your soul and giving you Michael Jordan and Bieber.
[02:00:49.559 --> 02:00:51.079]  Unlock your human potential.
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:56.119]  Defeat the globalists who want to shatter your mind, your doorways to perception.
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:00:59.039]  I want to see you truly live.
[02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:02.180]  I want to see you truly be who you are.
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:15.439]  I don't want my progeny who's coming, my unborn grandchildren and great-grandchildren to live in this nightmare system these control freaks have created.
[02:01:16.449 --> 02:01:30.369]  Where these wicked globalists are so threatened by human potential, they poison the water, the vaccines, the food to turn us into a bunch of slugs, a bunch of lobotomized sloths so they can control us.
[02:01:30.449 --> 02:01:31.350]  It is a crime.
[02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:36.989]  It is the most jealous, envious, greedy, hateful, sickening thing the New World Order does.
[02:01:37.090 --> 02:01:40.529]  And that's why I am so pleased to be committed in the fight against them.
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:44.060]  That's why I don't care about my own life except I wanna continue to live to fight them.
[02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:46.199]  That's why I don't have fear.
[02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:51.399]  I only have fear of myself and my flesh and not being up to the challenge.
[02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:58.369]  And I ask you to look in the mirror and ask yourselves, what are you doing in this time of great challenge?
[02:01:58.850 --> 02:02:00.729]  What are you doing to unlock minds?
[02:02:01.569 --> 02:02:06.029]  Once you unlock a mind, once you unlock somebody, then they can unlock their soul.
[02:02:06.250 --> 02:02:07.369]  We can't unlock a soul.
[02:02:07.609 --> 02:02:08.750]  Only God can do that.
[02:02:08.869 --> 02:02:10.329]  But we can unlock minds.
[02:02:10.529 --> 02:02:14.989]  And once the mind is unlocked, once the intellect is turned on, then comes the discernment.
[02:02:15.130 --> 02:02:16.930]  Then comes the awakening of the soul.
[02:02:17.350 --> 02:02:20.510]  Then comes true enlightenment and empowerment.
[02:02:21.869 --> 02:02:28.909]  So the globalists seek to make you a bunch of jealous, stunted, weak, backstabbing, gibbering demons.
[02:02:29.710 --> 02:02:32.689]  All of us have the lower elements and the higher.
[02:02:32.890 --> 02:02:34.390]  We must strive for the higher.
[02:02:34.569 --> 02:02:35.409]  Stay with us!
[02:02:36.109 --> 02:02:37.710]  I'm always loving to them.
[02:02:38.350 --> 02:02:44.930]  Do you think that what you've done, choosing the sort of life that you've chosen to lead, is going to make things very, very difficult for your children?
[02:02:45.149 --> 02:02:47.149]  No, I think it's going to make it wonderful for them.
[02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:49.810]  So far, they think mommy's wonderful.
[02:02:50.590 --> 02:02:54.550]  Don't you think it's about time we redefined human relationships?
[02:02:55.050 --> 02:03:02.949]  Haven't we really messed up a lot of people's lives with our old-fashioned values, our old-fashioned bombs?
[02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:09.069]  Aren't we in the generation that should practice what we preach?
[02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:12.689]  Is there a love in your life at the moment?
[02:03:13.550 --> 02:03:14.409]  Oh, yes.
[02:03:14.810 --> 02:03:15.189]  How many?
[02:03:16.350 --> 02:03:17.189]  How many?
[02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:19.010]  Is there a love in my life?
[02:03:19.029 --> 02:03:19.550]  How many?
[02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:21.170]  Well, is there a man in your life?
[02:03:21.310 --> 02:03:22.250]  A special man in your life?
[02:03:22.250 --> 02:03:22.489]  Yes.
[02:03:23.390 --> 02:03:23.930]  Any hints?
[02:03:24.270 --> 02:03:24.590]  No.
[02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:27.250]  Somebody will find out sooner or later later.
[02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:27.470]  Sure.
[02:03:27.810 --> 02:03:30.569]  Does that bother you that you don't have a private life whether you like it or not?
[02:03:30.609 --> 02:03:31.470]  Right now I do.
[02:03:31.729 --> 02:03:32.569]  I love it.
[02:03:32.710 --> 02:03:33.810]  How long do you think that will last?
[02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:37.470]  I don't care.
[02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:45.350]  Reading things about you and even reading your book, it's very easy to get the impression that you're preoccupied with relationships.
[02:03:45.689 --> 02:03:46.510]  Yes, boy crazy.
[02:03:47.090 --> 02:03:48.569]  Now it's the man crazy.
[02:03:49.529 --> 02:03:57.130]  Her approach to motherhood, like her approach to most things, is an odd mixture of naive wisdom and amazing short-sightedness.
[02:03:57.270 --> 02:04:03.189]  She sees her three sons, Justin, Sasha and Michelle, for five days every two weeks.
[02:04:13.649 --> 02:04:14.789]  That is him.
[02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:16.390]  Holy shit, that is him.
[02:04:20.489 --> 02:04:24.029]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host of The Alex Jones Show today.
[02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:26.069]  Alex will be back in studio on Thursday.
[02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:27.609]  We are wishing you a happy new year.
[02:04:27.750 --> 02:04:30.250]  I am honored to be joined by Dr. Robert Malone.
[02:04:30.409 --> 02:04:31.670]  You know who he is.
[02:04:31.850 --> 02:04:33.369]  You can support him at malone.news.
[02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:37.550]  Follow him on X. And I gotta say, doctor, it's an honor and pleasure to be speaking with you for the first time.
[02:04:37.630 --> 02:04:38.829]  I've followed your work for some time.
[02:04:39.470 --> 02:04:42.170]  Very impressed with you and grateful for the work that you've done.
[02:04:42.910 --> 02:04:50.170]  I have in my office at home a bunch of patents hanging up on the wall, but they're all Nikola Tesla patents because they look so cool with the drawings.
[02:04:50.590 --> 02:04:53.890]  You actually have, it looks like your own patents hanging up on the wall behind you.
[02:04:53.989 --> 02:04:54.810]  That's next level.
[02:04:56.130 --> 02:05:01.630]  I call it my Alex Berenson wall of disinformation.
[02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:14.550]  In our substack, and it's just hitting now, we got a huge bump in paid subscribers when Alex attacked me on Fox News years ago now.
[02:05:14.989 --> 02:05:19.649]  And every year, it rolls around this time, and they all plus up with another year's subscription.
[02:05:19.930 --> 02:05:25.949]  So, Jill tells me that I'd actually thank Alex for his efforts.
[02:05:26.250 --> 02:05:26.250]  Absolutely.
[02:05:26.250 --> 02:05:28.329]  Well, never underestimate the Streisand effect.
[02:05:28.569 --> 02:05:32.250]  There's no such thing as bad publicity, and it's better to be infamous than not famous at all.
[02:05:32.569 --> 02:05:34.529]  So, congratulations on that success.
[02:05:34.529 --> 02:05:38.529]  I'm glad, and I hope that our audience will continue to support you in a more and more expansive way.
[02:05:38.670 --> 02:05:42.090]  So, obviously, you are the mRNA expert.
[02:05:43.090 --> 02:05:45.510]  This bird flu thing has been coming up quite a bit.
[02:05:45.609 --> 02:05:58.750]  I have some very specific things that I want to ask you about, but I want to start with your macro take on what is happening with this bird flu, how it relates to what we experienced in 2020 and what you think is really going on.
[02:05:58.989 --> 02:06:01.789]  Let's just generally attack from that perspective.
[02:06:03.289 --> 02:06:11.750]  So I put out four or five Substack articles on this, and about two weeks ago, I just plus-upped with another threat assessment, updated threat assessment.
[02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:27.550]  The bottom line that everybody needs to be aware of, of course, the CDC doesn't have much credibility these days, but even the CDC is making this statement in its website that the risk associated with bird flu is low.
[02:06:29.529 --> 02:06:32.949]  Here's the key things that people need to keep in mind.
[02:06:33.170 --> 02:06:35.029]  I'm empowering you, the audience.
[02:06:35.630 --> 02:06:41.670]  Here's the way that any professional ought to be looking at any emerging infectious disease outbreak.
[02:06:42.649 --> 02:06:44.909]  Two key points to consider.
[02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:49.170]  Number one, are you seeing a high level of disease?
[02:06:52.020 --> 02:06:59.720]  We're good to go.
[02:07:09.619 --> 02:07:33.579]  Now, what Lena Nguyen is citing, and also Bob Redfield, former CDC director who seems to have gone rogue again, is the old, debunked, outdated WHO statements that bird flu historically has been associated with approximately a 50% case fatality rate.
[02:07:33.899 --> 02:07:37.020]  That is pure, unadulterated fear porn.
[02:07:37.619 --> 02:07:42.300]  What it represents is an artifact of data sampling.
[02:07:43.039 --> 02:07:46.899]  What the WHO collects is information on the most severe cases.
[02:07:46.899 --> 02:07:54.640]  If you have a mild case of something, your doc doesn't call up the WHO and say, hey, you know, this just happened.
[02:07:55.100 --> 02:08:04.340]  No, the only cases that come to the attention of the World Health Organization are the severe cases, often in people who already have significant pre-existing conditions.
[02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:09.260]  Now, we all went through this rodeo with COVID, so you understand how this works.
[02:08:10.970 --> 02:08:13.130]  I think?
[02:08:31.050 --> 02:08:34.909]  3.4 or 3.5% case fatality rate.
[02:08:35.010 --> 02:08:38.670]  In other words, three to four out of every hundred people infected die.
[02:08:38.930 --> 02:08:40.630]  That turns out to be fraud.
[02:08:41.310 --> 02:08:46.350]  And the true case fatality rate with COVID was a fraction of a fraction of 1%.
[02:08:46.350 --> 02:08:55.829]  And this was known early on by a Stanford epidemiologist and public health expert who actually did the right work rather than modeling it.
[02:08:56.090 --> 02:08:59.470]  Same is true with this bird flu outbreak.
[02:09:00.210 --> 02:09:01.069]  So what are the data?
[02:09:01.289 --> 02:09:09.329]  We have something around 60 cases here in the United States, and we have, wait for it, a total of zero deaths.
[02:09:09.590 --> 02:09:13.810]  Do we have any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission?
[02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:15.310]  The answer is no.
[02:09:15.850 --> 02:09:20.310]  What we do have is an epidemic of testing.
[02:09:21.180 --> 02:09:28.800]  The public health infrastructure within the United States has decided that it's necessary to greatly expand testing.
[02:09:29.159 --> 02:09:31.060]  Remember the PCR story.
[02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:41.100]  With PCR, if you turn up the cycle numbers, you can get positives for anything, especially if you're working in a laboratory that is already testing for whatever that pathogen is.
[02:09:41.239 --> 02:09:46.100]  This is a problem with contamination that's notorious in PCR testing laboratories.
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:50.420]  And so, you test more, you find more.
[02:09:50.619 --> 02:09:52.020]  Well, what are you finding?
[02:09:52.659 --> 02:09:53.979]  This is valid.
[02:09:54.779 --> 02:09:57.600]  They were not previously testing cattle.
[02:09:58.729 --> 02:10:08.970]  The issue, to your point, about trying to migrate the mRNA vaccines into livestock and the human food supply...
[02:10:08.970 --> 02:10:16.369]  Now, I would quibble with you about whether or not we have data that they're transmittable from food sources.
[02:10:16.550 --> 02:10:18.750]  Other than milk, that's not shown.
[02:10:19.210 --> 02:10:25.189]  But in any case, the one thing that was very clear...
[02:10:25.949 --> 02:10:37.829]  That the mRNA vaccine technology was not appropriate for was for dairy cattle in particular, because we know that these products are shed in human breast milk.
[02:10:38.229 --> 02:10:43.909]  And lo and behold, they're likely also shed in dairy.
[02:10:45.170 --> 02:10:46.930]  Now, they started testing dairy.
[02:10:47.090 --> 02:10:48.909]  They wanted to jab the cows.
[02:10:49.329 --> 02:10:52.329]  They started testing dairy for bird flu.
[02:10:52.609 --> 02:11:01.270]  And what they found was that the glands in the udders that produce the milk actually support replication of bird flu.
[02:11:01.390 --> 02:11:02.310]  Is this a new finding?
[02:11:03.029 --> 02:11:09.829]  We don't know because they didn't used to test for bird flu in cattle or many other species.
[02:11:10.010 --> 02:11:11.130]  This is a new phenomenon.
[02:11:11.970 --> 02:11:20.529]  And so, yes, we're having bird flu virus, H5N1, which has been around for my entire career.
[02:11:21.550 --> 02:11:24.010]  Is endemic in waterfowl, by the way.
[02:11:24.109 --> 02:11:27.170]  There's no way we're ever going to eradicate bird flu.
[02:11:27.489 --> 02:11:45.550]  To do that, we would have to kill all the migratory geese and ducks in North America because they are all basically chronic carriers and shed enormous amounts of influenza virus in their stool into water supplies.
[02:11:45.710 --> 02:11:46.710]  This is just the facts.
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:12:04.079]  So what we're seeing now that we're testing so much is that dairy workers, particularly in Southern California, are at some low frequency, very low frequency, a total of something less than 60 people have developed symptoms,
[02:12:04.079 --> 02:12:12.939]  and those people are associated with the presence of PCR positive signal for bird flu, which we weren't previously testing for.
[02:12:13.710 --> 02:12:14.810]  What are those symptoms?
[02:12:14.970 --> 02:12:15.529]  Are they dying?
[02:12:15.609 --> 02:12:16.449]  Are they going to the hospital?
[02:12:16.630 --> 02:12:22.989]  No, mostly they're getting conjunctivitis and pink eye, which they recover from naturally without any treatment.
[02:12:23.649 --> 02:12:27.729]  So this is absolutely not a medical crisis.
[02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:31.829]  It is not a biologic emergency.
[02:12:32.569 --> 02:12:38.109]  But the fear that has been circulated by Lena Nguyen and so many others...
[02:12:39.199 --> 02:12:55.159]  Recently, notoriously, with her appearance on Face the Nation, is that it's possible, it's theoretically possible, that at some point this avian influenza might mutate to become more infectious in humans.
[02:12:55.420 --> 02:12:59.600]  That is absolutely a possibility, but it's somewhere in the future.
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:04.239]  And by the way, decades of coexistence with bird flu has never had this happen.
[02:13:04.859 --> 02:13:20.180]  We have been through multiple outbreaks of fear porn around bird flu and had influenza vaccines developed and deployed for this, but there has never been a major outbreak.
[02:13:20.460 --> 02:13:41.510]  So the advocacy right now coming out of basically the pharmaceutical biodefense industrial complex, you know, teamed with the military industrial complex, We're going to have to deploy these mRNA vaccines that they have been paid hundreds of millions of dollars to develop by BARDA,
[02:13:41.970 --> 02:13:46.250]  a branch of Health and Human Services that will come under Bobby's supervision.
[02:13:47.219 --> 02:13:48.960]  Should he be confirmed?
[02:13:49.539 --> 02:13:54.119]  They have paid enormous amounts of money to have these products developed.
[02:13:54.340 --> 02:13:57.340]  There has been some stockpiling of these products.
[02:13:57.619 --> 02:14:00.279]  They are not tested clinically.
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:02.520]  They are not approved.
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:04.920]  They are not authorized for marketing.
[02:14:05.239 --> 02:14:09.479]  And there's no medical emergency, so there can't be an emergency use authorization.
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:28.500]  But the likes of Lena Nguyen and her colleagues are out beating the drums right now that the Biden administration ought to basically jump the shark, rush these things out, emergency use authorize them, circulate widely, home testing for bird flu.
[02:14:29.199 --> 02:14:43.659]  And completely avoid any clinical trials and just start jabbing people with these new bird flu vaccines because they elicit an antibody response in animals, okay?
[02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:46.739]  And this is the other part of this whole problem set.
[02:14:47.460 --> 02:14:55.380]  Is Lena Nguyen, bless her heart sugar, has no bloody clue about influenza and immunology.
[02:14:55.579 --> 02:15:08.319]  And she doesn't understand that just because there's antibodies produced in an animal, that does not mean that a product, quote, vaccine is going to be effective in humans.
[02:15:08.659 --> 02:15:16.439]  Historically, even the best influenza vaccines lately have been something like 20 to 40% effective.
[02:15:16.890 --> 02:15:31.670]  Now we've been through that rodeo with COVID. If you administer a crummy, leaky vaccine in the face of any kind of a major public health outbreak, what you get is an infectious disease that's more resistant to the vaccine.
[02:15:31.909 --> 02:15:32.829]  Come on, guys.
[02:15:33.069 --> 02:15:34.930]  How many times do we have to learn this lesson?
[02:15:35.899 --> 02:15:45.420]  So they are advocating that they just go ahead and start jabbing in the, what is it, three weeks left of the Biden administration.
[02:15:45.699 --> 02:15:45.939]  Right.
[02:15:46.199 --> 02:15:47.979]  As many as possible before the 20th.
[02:15:48.670 --> 02:16:02.210]  Before the Trump administration comes in and shuts them down, because they've dropped hundreds of millions of dollars, and these companies that are manufacturing this product, like Pfizer and Moderna, want to get it out into the market.
[02:16:02.430 --> 02:16:22.670]  And they are afraid, for good reason, that the new director of the FDA, the new director of the CDC, the new director of NIH, and their boss, Bobby Kennedy, presumably, Psychological bioterrorism PSYOP,
[02:16:22.789 --> 02:16:24.789]  which is what is being deployed right now.
[02:16:24.949 --> 02:16:27.170]  I'll stop there and let you get a word in edgewise.
[02:16:27.449 --> 02:16:28.949]  No, I love that analysis.
[02:16:28.949 --> 02:16:29.609]  It's so powerful.
[02:16:29.770 --> 02:16:41.270]  I had Dr. McCullough on yesterday, and he enlightened me to the fact that there have been some gain-of-function research done on the bird flu, which made it transmissible from poultry to mallard ducks.
[02:16:41.489 --> 02:16:43.770]  Of course, that increases the ability for it to spread.
[02:16:43.870 --> 02:16:44.170]  I got this...
[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:47.879]  This study right here, this is from Peter McCullough's Substack.
[02:16:51.459 --> 02:17:05.340]  What are your thoughts on whether or not this strain of bird flu has been manipulated?
[02:17:07.620 --> 02:17:10.239]  I'm not aware of genetic evidence that that's the case.
[02:17:10.399 --> 02:17:19.260]  And by the way, Peter, bless his heart, is a great cardiologist and a renal specialist, but he knows almost nothing about molecular biology, virology, and vaccinology.
[02:17:19.479 --> 02:17:20.959]  Just to make that point.
[02:17:21.159 --> 02:17:21.299]  Sure.
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:24.459]  Well, that's something that he and I share in common.
[02:17:24.719 --> 02:17:25.940]  The history?
[02:17:26.219 --> 02:17:27.600]  Okay, fair enough.
[02:17:28.559 --> 02:17:30.159]  But you don't...
[02:17:30.159 --> 02:17:31.559]  Let's not go there.
[02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:31.840]  Okay.
[02:17:32.379 --> 02:17:36.799]  So, the history of gain-of-function research in influenza is long.
[02:17:37.610 --> 02:17:53.750]  In fact, it was the advent of a paper, I think it's two manuscripts, one from the Netherlands and one from the University of Wisconsin years ago, that demonstrated that influenza can be adapted,
[02:17:53.870 --> 02:17:57.850]  avian influenza can be adapted to infect mammals.
[02:17:58.450 --> 02:18:03.610]  Through a couple of specific point mutations, both laboratories independently found those mutations.
[02:18:04.510 --> 02:18:08.709]  That prompted the original ban on gain-of-function research.
[02:18:09.069 --> 02:18:15.989]  There's also a laboratory at the University of Georgia that's been doing gain-of-function research on avian influenza.
[02:18:16.370 --> 02:18:36.889]  So there are multiple approaches, and it's all justified as dual-function research that has both a potential knowledge gain component, As well as a potential weaponization component or application.
[02:18:37.149 --> 02:18:46.649]  Now it goes back even further than that in terms of influenza because the CDC really did groundbreaking research over a decade ago.
[02:18:47.250 --> 02:19:02.790]  That demonstrated that there are a couple of specific point mutations that you can put in influenza to cause it to shift from upper airway, which tends to be relatively non-pathogenic, to lower airway, which is less effective but much more pathogenic.
[02:19:03.420 --> 02:19:07.780]  I think?
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:29.959]  derives from laboratory-based gain-of-function research in my mind is a bridge too far.
[02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:31.979]  We don't have that evidence.
[02:19:32.139 --> 02:19:35.360]  Personally, I think it's irresponsible to make those kinds of statements.
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:37.399]  Has any sequence analysis been done?
[02:19:38.399 --> 02:19:44.040]  It creates a situation in which the public is like the boy crying wolf.
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:53.500]  This may happen at some point in time, and we want people, when we say this is what's happened, we want them to have confidence that, in fact, that's what's happened.
[02:19:53.760 --> 02:20:00.620]  So that's my take on the issue of gain-of-function research, laboratory research, including serial passage.
[02:20:01.250 --> 02:20:04.190]  That's old school gain-of-function research.
[02:20:04.389 --> 02:20:13.450]  And by the way, serial passage was probably done at University of North Carolina by Ralph Baric on the SARS-CoV-2.
[02:20:13.729 --> 02:20:17.430]  So, you know, this is, it just keeps coming around and around.
[02:20:17.909 --> 02:20:26.049]  Has any sequence analysis been done in a substantial way on the existing strains of this specific bird flu?
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:28.780]  My understanding is the answer is yes.
[02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:46.500]  Is that there is a case in Louisiana of an elderly gentleman with multiple pre-existing conditions.
[02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:50.840]  Presumably, he worked on one of these major chicken farms.
[02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:51.360]  I don't know.
[02:20:52.100 --> 02:20:57.819]  And was in close contact with a number of chicken carcasses that had been infected.
[02:20:58.680 --> 02:21:10.719]  And he developed kind of a slow-burning, indolent infection with this avian influenza, no surprise, and he is quite ill but has not passed away.
[02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:35.790]  You know, this is another case, like we heard again and again with SARS-CoV-2, where the press is jumping on these things, asserting that, and there's another case in Mexico, which the Mexican government denies, But the press is asserting that these cases where avian influenza has been detected are demonstrating that avian influenza is what's causing this more severe disease,
[02:21:36.010 --> 02:21:41.409]  where specifically this gentleman in Louisiana has a lot of other diseases.
[02:21:41.549 --> 02:21:45.250]  It just happens that makes him more susceptible to avian influenza.
[02:21:45.250 --> 02:21:58.750]  Now, in his case, because it's been burning in his body, And any RNA virus is highly prone to mutation because it's involved in the molecular biology of RNA replication.
[02:21:59.170 --> 02:22:13.020]  Those RNA polymerases are error-prone, and these viruses evolve, particularly if they stay in your body a long time, like HIV. And so there has been a couple of mutations in the case of this gentleman.
[02:22:13.379 --> 02:22:16.940]  There's no reports that those have been transmitted to third parties.
[02:22:17.180 --> 02:22:25.020]  Remember, sustained human-to-human transmission is a characteristic you have to see, and if it's not there, it's fear porn.
[02:22:25.649 --> 02:22:36.629]  Okay, so that's how I see it right now, is we do have significant insight into where the bad problems might arise.
[02:22:37.649 --> 02:22:50.729]  If those had occurred, I guarantee it would have been shouted from the rooftops all across the world, including from Tedros Cabresos at WHO. There has been none of those reports.
[02:22:51.549 --> 02:22:59.989]  And of course it's evolving, particularly in people that are chronically infected, because that's what happens with RNA viruses.
[02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:01.440]  Sure.
[02:23:01.639 --> 02:23:02.780]  Well, here's what I'm curious about then.
[02:23:02.959 --> 02:23:15.540]  If we've established there's not human to human transference and we've transmission and we've established that a lot of these mortality claims of 50 to 60% of those infected are greatly exaggerated.
[02:23:16.459 --> 02:23:22.559]  My next question, of course, for you is what is the mortality rate of chickens that are infected?
[02:23:22.780 --> 02:23:23.360]  Do we know that?
[02:23:24.969 --> 02:23:25.969]  So that's a good question.
[02:23:26.129 --> 02:23:28.430]  And I don't know the specifics.
[02:23:28.489 --> 02:23:35.889]  I do know that there is a significant mortality associated with bird flu in a number of different species of which chickens is one.
[02:23:36.129 --> 02:23:56.659]  And there is also a standard U.S.-centric public policy, but it's shared in many other nations, that if you have a chicken house that gets infected, We're good to go.
[02:24:07.930 --> 02:24:09.469]  I used to live in North Georgia.
[02:24:10.149 --> 02:24:22.649]  If any of your listeners haven't ever encountered a modern commercial-grade chicken farm, they ought to find out about it.
[02:24:22.729 --> 02:24:27.950]  Because that's the real problem here, is that factory farming...
[02:24:28.670 --> 02:24:35.709]  It gives rise to the emergence of infectious disease, particularly viral infectious disease.
[02:24:35.969 --> 02:24:44.709]  And that includes, in particular, swine farming, swine factory farming, where you have animals closely quartered with each other.
[02:24:44.969 --> 02:24:49.270]  And absolutely includes chicken farming and turkeys, by the way.
[02:24:50.049 --> 02:24:52.510]  So that...
[02:24:53.370 --> 02:25:01.229]  That's the logic that the industry has established, and it's debatable.
[02:25:01.430 --> 02:25:07.750]  I think it's something that really ought to be revisited with the new USDA director.
[02:25:08.049 --> 02:25:09.329]  We have an opportunity.
[02:25:09.590 --> 02:25:10.649]  Thank you for those clips.
[02:25:11.399 --> 02:25:14.940]  Yeah, it's stunning what goes on in these farms.
[02:25:17.100 --> 02:25:23.100]  So what you're looking at there with that clip is actually friars.
[02:25:23.739 --> 02:25:31.239]  And what you're looking at is they have been bred so that when they're harvested, they get so fat they can't even walk.
[02:25:32.540 --> 02:25:40.079]  And they have to be harvested at that point because a week later they're going to start dying because they can't actually walk around in their coop.
[02:25:40.889 --> 02:25:49.750]  So it's really a very ugly business in order to shave a few nickels off the price per pound of the poultry that we eat.
[02:25:50.030 --> 02:25:57.870]  And it absolutely gives rise to these high-risk environments for evolution of infectious disease.
[02:25:58.090 --> 02:26:03.209]  But the good news is that chicken lungs are very, very different from human lungs.
[02:26:04.610 --> 02:26:08.829]  And as a consequence, I don't even know that I would want to broadcast those images.
[02:26:09.229 --> 02:26:10.670]  As a consequence...
[02:26:10.670 --> 02:26:11.770]  What's the matter, Dr. Malone?
[02:26:11.889 --> 02:26:12.090]  Chicken?
[02:26:13.809 --> 02:26:15.530]  No, it's an ugly business.
[02:26:15.729 --> 02:26:17.149]  I mean, we raise chicken here.
[02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:24.170]  I've slaughtered roosters and put them in the freezer, but it doesn't look anything like that.
[02:26:24.209 --> 02:26:24.389]  Sure.
[02:26:25.489 --> 02:26:29.370]  Well, Dr. Malone, we're coming up on a break in 30 seconds for four minutes.
[02:26:29.469 --> 02:26:41.309]  And on the other side of this, I want to talk to you specifically about mRNA and just educate myself and the audience on what the difference between RNA and DNA is and the potential and the capacity for the technology.
[02:26:41.409 --> 02:26:45.010]  Because if this bird flu is not a threat to human beings...
[02:26:45.659 --> 02:26:50.200]  And it's potentially a major threat to all these flocks of chickens and creating shortages.
[02:26:50.739 --> 02:26:56.739]  I wanna talk a little bit about what it means if we vaccinate the actual birds and the flocks and the livestock that we have.
[02:26:56.860 --> 02:26:58.120]  Stay with us for more on the other side.
[02:26:58.180 --> 02:26:59.120]  Thank you so much, Dr. Malone.
[02:26:59.299 --> 02:27:06.079]  My dad is chemistry background, also retired doctor, but he came in to help me run my supplement division 13 years ago.
[02:27:06.319 --> 02:27:07.879]  The deep state sued the hell out of him.
[02:27:07.979 --> 02:27:09.319]  We're going to our guest in a moment, but I gotta do this.
[02:27:09.379 --> 02:27:09.739]  Thank you, sir.
[02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:13.889]  They basically almost destroyed my parents.
[02:27:14.010 --> 02:27:20.450]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family that my dad was at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits the Democrats filed.
[02:27:20.610 --> 02:27:24.450]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are $316 million yesterday.
[02:27:24.829 --> 02:27:27.409]  They filed before they spent $80 million suing me.
[02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:29.229]  We spent $16 million fighting them.
[02:27:29.370 --> 02:27:31.110]  My dad spent $2 million fighting them.
[02:27:31.170 --> 02:27:32.250]  And we're finally winning.
[02:27:32.469 --> 02:27:43.770]  Not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnationals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request, I ask you, To support him because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[02:27:44.129 --> 02:27:53.969]  He was giving everything to InfoWars and then personally going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me because that's how dads are.
[02:27:54.409 --> 02:27:55.469]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[02:27:55.629 --> 02:28:01.750]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office and I got pissed.
[02:28:02.639 --> 02:28:09.479]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day, and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[02:28:09.959 --> 02:28:11.200]  The supplements are there.
[02:28:11.379 --> 02:28:11.979]  They're great.
[02:28:12.159 --> 02:28:13.319]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[02:28:13.379 --> 02:28:14.280]  He's put everything into it.
[02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:14.700]  He has.
[02:28:14.780 --> 02:28:15.360]  They're incredible.
[02:28:15.620 --> 02:28:25.299]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, that I don't want to belabor this.
[02:28:25.379 --> 02:28:26.620]  We have important topics to cover.
[02:28:27.450 --> 02:28:28.690]  Please support us.
[02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:30.889]  Go to drjonesdactyls.com.

[02:28:49.709 --> 02:28:51.329]  And my dad literally...
[02:28:51.899 --> 02:28:57.420]  Took a loan last week to be able to buy the product that's coming in finally next week.
[02:28:57.639 --> 02:28:59.719]  Turbo Force, things like that that are popular.
[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:02.420]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[02:29:02.979 --> 02:29:06.920]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[02:29:07.260 --> 02:29:08.579]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[02:29:08.719 --> 02:29:09.360]  He's a fighter.
[02:29:09.459 --> 02:29:10.319]  Hell, he's my dad.
[02:29:10.479 --> 02:29:11.440]  I think I'm a fighter.
[02:29:11.659 --> 02:29:13.059]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[02:29:13.739 --> 02:29:21.280]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:24.120]  But at this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:24.219 --> 02:29:25.200]  It's about my parents.
[02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:31.280]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's what the enemy targeted them.
[02:29:31.780 --> 02:29:34.799]  So, please support the InfoWar today.
[02:29:34.940 --> 02:29:36.920]  Support my mother and my father.
[02:29:36.959 --> 02:29:39.899]  I'm asking you personally for you to do it now.
[02:29:40.120 --> 02:29:44.639]  And if 5% of the millions watching will go do it, all our problems will be over in one minute.
[02:29:44.739 --> 02:29:50.299]  But it's less than one-half, one percent to ever buy anything from drjonesnaturals.com or thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:53.920]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight for our futures.
[02:29:54.319 --> 02:29:57.579]  So, thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:29:57.639 --> 02:29:59.200]  I'm going to shut up at the balance of this hour.
[02:29:59.500 --> 02:30:01.600]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:01.780 --> 02:30:09.719]  I am Chase Geiser, your host today, joined by the great, the esteemed, the credible Robert Malone, Dr. Robert W. Malone.
[02:30:10.399 --> 02:30:18.879]  Doctor, I want to kind of recap what I've gathered from our conversation so far, just so we can make sure that I'm understanding you correctly, and then get into a couple of new things.
[02:30:19.059 --> 02:30:19.479]  So...
[02:30:20.020 --> 02:30:29.420]  There is some evidence of gain-of-function research being done on avian flus, generally speaking, but not specifically to this current strand of bird flu.
[02:30:29.559 --> 02:30:30.020]  Is that correct?
[02:30:30.500 --> 02:30:31.959]  But more than some evidence.
[02:30:32.139 --> 02:30:33.500]  There's multiple publications.
[02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:34.280]  Right, absolutely.
[02:30:34.559 --> 02:30:34.799]  This is established.
[02:30:35.360 --> 02:30:49.760]  Established, but the sequencing research that has been done so far on this, which you seem to think is fairly extensive, does not indicate necessarily that transmissible gain-of-function is implemented on this specific strand.
[02:30:50.010 --> 02:30:55.370]  However, it could come out in later developments that that's the case, but not necessarily there yet to make that claim.
[02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:59.190]  Now, we know that the virus is not particularly lethal to humans.
[02:30:59.290 --> 02:31:02.569]  It's certainly not transmissible human to human.
[02:31:02.969 --> 02:31:09.649]  However, it's very lethal to chickens if you take into consideration the culling policies associated with it.
[02:31:09.729 --> 02:31:16.250]  So even if it's not directly lethal to chickens, if the policy is, hey, if one in the coop gets it, then we're going to tear the whole place down.
[02:31:16.549 --> 02:31:18.370]  That's obviously very lethal then, right?
[02:31:20.440 --> 02:31:37.520]  It seems to me that we've got this situation in the context of the fact that miscellaneous poultry farm Fires have increased 200% over the last four years compared to four years before.
[02:31:37.639 --> 02:31:47.159]  There were 5,000 chickens who were killed in poultry farm fires from 2016 to 2020. There have been 1.5 million since 2020, 2024, according to the research that I've done.
[02:31:47.840 --> 02:31:51.239]  It's weird that these farms seem to be going up in flames.
[02:31:51.340 --> 02:31:53.000]  Maybe there's an explanation that's reasonable for it.
[02:31:53.239 --> 02:31:59.579]  Maybe it's something that the farmers do when they realize there's an infection, and rather than killing their whole herd, they want to claim insurance, so they burn it down.
[02:31:59.659 --> 02:32:00.780]  I don't know if there's fraud going on.
[02:32:00.879 --> 02:32:04.659]  I don't know if it's a deep state going in and trying to create an artificial shortage or not.
[02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:12.680]  But there definitely is a push to vaccinate humans in contact with this livestock, with this poultry.
[02:32:13.260 --> 02:32:20.219]  And there has been a push for years to actually vaccinate the poultry directly with mRNA vaccines.
[02:32:20.219 --> 02:32:21.280]  Is that correct so far?
[02:32:21.700 --> 02:32:22.299]  Forgive me.
[02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:30.989]  So, the deployed Merck product, and by the way, we started covering this about three years ago.
[02:32:31.069 --> 02:32:33.770]  I think we're the ones that first broke the story in our substack.
[02:32:34.579 --> 02:32:40.819]  The deployed Merck mRNA vaccine product for livestock is for swine.
[02:32:41.020 --> 02:32:45.379]  It's for these large pig factories.
[02:32:45.780 --> 02:33:04.000]  And what Merck does is it comes into a very large swine herd, samples the circulating viruses, and then builds a custom mRNA vaccine for those circulating viruses, and then goes ahead and vaccinates that swine herd.
[02:33:04.670 --> 02:33:26.270]  So the swine industry, your pork, absolutely has been, is highly probable, if you're buying it from one of the major producers or the major slaughterhouses indirectly, you probably are receiving a pork product that has been treated with an mRNA product devised by Merck.
[02:33:27.129 --> 02:33:39.809]  The chicken industry, and I've actually consulted with the USDA on this, the chicken industry has extremely tight profit margins, pennies per bird.
[02:33:40.329 --> 02:33:46.930]  And the cost of vaccine products is higher than their profit margin.
[02:33:47.209 --> 02:33:55.610]  So they have not, to the best of my knowledge, deployed these products into their chicken houses.
[02:33:56.549 --> 02:34:05.290]  At this point, because it's too expensive, just the mere handling of the chicks to administer the product would exceed their profit margin.
[02:34:05.850 --> 02:34:11.250]  The profit margins on chickens are extremely tight.
[02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:14.250]  So this has been the problem historically.
[02:34:14.250 --> 02:34:23.850]  The other key problem with the idea of vaccinating these large flocks is Yeah.
[02:34:40.610 --> 02:34:44.489]  In poultry industry and also historically in swine.
[02:34:44.709 --> 02:34:48.909]  In Denmark, they don't vaccinate at all for this very reason.
[02:34:49.229 --> 02:35:04.889]  In chickens, the lesson has been that it's better in terms of the functional outcome, if you look at the big picture, to go ahead and slaughter the whole flock rather than to try to vaccinate prophylactically.
[02:35:05.850 --> 02:35:18.940]  There's also this, you may recall some of you, Gert van den Bosche, Who I used to be a work colleague with at the company called Solve out of Waste, Netherlands.
[02:35:20.219 --> 02:35:37.760]  Gert, in his initial objections about the policies for COVID, raised the prospect of a particular chicken virus that was demonstrated upon vaccination to give rise to a more lethal virus that caused a cancer in chickens.
[02:35:39.010 --> 02:35:51.489]  And so this is one of the notable cases that illustrates the point that a crummy vaccine, particularly in livestock conditions, is a lot worse than no vaccine at all.
[02:35:51.829 --> 02:35:56.209]  And so those are the drivers here.
[02:35:56.469 --> 02:35:57.389]  One is economic.
[02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:10.000]  And the other is this practical consideration that a less than perfect vaccine often results in an even worse outcome than culling the flocks.
[02:36:10.219 --> 02:36:12.520]  So that's how we get to this point.
[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:16.739]  Now, in terms of the chicken barn fires...
[02:36:18.129 --> 02:36:30.430]  You know, given the New World Order and the globalists' various machinations and nefarious activity, I don't think you can discount nefarious activity here.
[02:36:30.649 --> 02:36:47.329]  But another alternative hypothesis, I can tell you that not only are the margins in producing chickens painfully tight, But the economic reality that the modern chicken farmer faces, which is essentially indentured servitude,
[02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:52.670]  they're forced into a position where they have to get massive loans for these huge barn operations.
[02:36:52.670 --> 02:36:57.250]  They get them from the likes of Purdue and the big chicken producers.
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:02.920]  They have to use their chicks, their genetics.
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:05.059]  They have to use their food.
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:21.700]  And these large poultry producers basically put the squeeze on the poor souls out in the sticks in Tennessee and northern Georgia and everywhere else to keep their costs down by making it extremely difficult for these people to gain a profit.
[02:37:21.819 --> 02:37:22.100]  Right.
[02:37:22.270 --> 02:37:25.709]  And they end up in an indentured servitude environment.
[02:37:26.049 --> 02:37:39.850]  And I could well imagine that if I was in a situation like that, or if I just inherited it from my dad, I might be a little prone to thinking about whether or not it's a good idea to continue this business.
[02:37:39.850 --> 02:37:47.149]  And if you have a contract, you're kind of locked in, and they all have contracts, and so you don't have many options for an exit.
[02:37:47.989 --> 02:38:02.250]  I just hypothesize that what we may be seeing is the logical outcome of a rather rapacious business practice that is really exploiting poor people.
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:13.799]  I understand what you're saying about the vaccines being too expensive to justify the cost because the margins are so tight on chicken farming as it stands.
[02:38:13.959 --> 02:38:15.139]  That makes total sense to me.
[02:38:15.299 --> 02:38:19.159]  My concern and my speculation and please be as hard on me as you want.
[02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:48.739]  My concern is that if the bird flu spread significantly, resulting in the death of a substantial number of chickens, and if because of these incredibly tight profit margins, more and more chicken farmers decide to get out of the business, that that would create a shortage Well,
[02:38:48.739 --> 02:38:59.180]  I think that what we've seen with the government is a willingness to stretch credibility in order to advance a variety of agendas.
[02:38:59.379 --> 02:39:00.739]  And one of those agendas...
[02:39:01.260 --> 02:39:05.040]  Is the development of this technology platform.
[02:39:05.959 --> 02:39:23.260]  And their behavior, the Peter Marks, Bob Kadlec initiative that is called Operation Warp Speed, of basically throwing regulatory norms in human vaccine development in the trash can,
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:27.760]  norms that have been developed over decades and were there for good reason.
[02:39:28.970 --> 02:39:38.430]  The government was clearly in a rush to jam this thing through, this tech, damn the torpedoes.
[02:39:38.569 --> 02:39:50.670]  And I don't think you can be skeptical enough of government bureaucratic initiatives and intent.
[02:39:51.549 --> 02:40:14.030]  I absolutely endorse that one should be extremely vigilant and extremely aggressive as an investigative journalist operation like the Alex Jones show in Infowars in pursuing and holding accountable government officials for their behaviors.
[02:40:14.290 --> 02:40:33.829]  And it's highly likely that they will use any justification to Advance the use of this technology in every possible application, hence my skepticism about why the emphasis on cattle,
[02:40:33.989 --> 02:40:54.479]  because cattle was the clear, bright line in the sand for why Mm-hmm.
[02:40:55.399 --> 02:40:58.159]  Mm-hmm.
[02:41:05.049 --> 02:41:21.549]  In cattle, in part because of the dairy implications and in part because the cattlemen's associations raised the point that it would decrease the value of their product because consumers would be less likely to take it.
[02:41:21.649 --> 02:41:23.110]  So if you want to go down the...
[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:26.899]  What is a conspiracy theory anymore?
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:28.440]  It's just a hypothesis, right?
[02:41:28.979 --> 02:41:44.260]  So one hypothesis in a world in which there is a concerted effort to reduce a reliance on cattle as a component of the food supply is that it's actually a good thing, if that's your agenda,
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:47.399]  to make consumers more skeptical about buying meat.
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:42:00.440]  And so, I don't think you can be too skeptical about the agendas and the initiatives that are going on.
[02:42:00.739 --> 02:42:16.079]  Hence, the logic that what we're dealing with, what Bobby, to his credit, and President-elect Trump are dealing with, is the most powerful consortium In the world right now,
[02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:21.799]  which is the alignment between the pharmaceutical industry and the military-industrial complex.
[02:42:22.879 --> 02:42:33.459]  And these folks, you wanted to touch on, before the break, you suggested that we would talk about the difference between RNA and DNA and what's behind all this, etc.
[02:42:33.659 --> 02:42:41.040]  Yeah, and I do want to get into that, but I want to mention to you that Alex has sent in a one-minute video of a couple of questions that he had for you, so I want to make sure that we can get to that as well.
[02:42:41.930 --> 02:42:45.370]  Let's actually run that clip right now and then have your response on the other side.
[02:42:46.930 --> 02:42:53.610]  Dr. Malone, thanks for coming on on the last day of 2024. I just had a couple questions for you while I was here watching.
[02:42:53.790 --> 02:43:01.709]  Can you elaborate on specifically what Dr. Peter McCullough is saying about all of the manipulation of these different flu strains?
[02:43:20.020 --> 02:43:23.680]  That's my first question.
[02:43:23.799 --> 02:43:30.239]  Secondarily, I've seen recently you said that this whole bird flu rollout is just a part two PSYOP. Can you elaborate on that?
[02:43:30.399 --> 02:43:33.020]  And it looks to me like almost no one's buying it.
[02:43:33.120 --> 02:43:34.500]  It's backfiring massively.
[02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:37.760]  What do you expect to come next from the bad guys?
[02:43:37.899 --> 02:43:45.979]  And then finally, this term of leaky vaccine or giving these new vaccines to people during some type of bird flu outbreak.
[02:43:45.979 --> 02:43:49.860]  And how could that cause worse mutations as they've been talking about?
[02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:50.899]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:43:53.399 --> 02:43:59.200]  Okay, let's see if I can remember, as I'm of a certain age, Alex's three points.
[02:43:59.239 --> 02:44:01.520]  Let's start with the most recent one.
[02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:08.139]  What could go wrong with deploying a leaky, inadequate vaccine?
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:17.520]  And the classic example is antibody-dependent enhancement of infection and disease.
[02:44:17.799 --> 02:44:33.469]  And so this was something that the FDA raised as a prospect with COVID. But in the case of influenza, this is well documented, that an ineffective vaccine that produces large amounts of,
[02:44:33.590 --> 02:44:37.409]  now I'm going to get techie, non-neutralizing antibody.
[02:44:37.409 --> 02:44:39.049]  What is neutralizing antibody?
[02:44:39.350 --> 02:44:44.389]  It coats the virus in ways that makes it so the virus can't infect other cells.
[02:44:45.270 --> 02:45:01.770]  Non-neutralizing antibody can coat the virus, bind to parts of the virus that doesn't block it from infecting its normal cell targets, but even worse, both kinds of antibodies that bind to—this is one way to split the baby,
[02:45:02.409 --> 02:45:04.190]  neutralizing and non-neutralizing.
[02:45:04.190 --> 02:45:06.129]  It's a lot more nuanced than that.
[02:45:06.329 --> 02:45:07.670]  Antibodies are very complex.
[02:45:08.049 --> 02:45:14.149]  They're basically a swarm of different abilities to bind the virus.
[02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:21.819]  But if you have a virus that is bound with an antibody, antibodies, you'll remember, are kind of like a fork.
[02:45:22.260 --> 02:45:25.700]  And the tines of the fork are the parts that bind.
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:31.059]  And the back end of the fork that you hold on to is called the FC region.
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:38.200]  And it has what's called FC receptors that will bind to it on other cell types.
[02:45:38.340 --> 02:45:59.520]  And in influenza, it's known that antibodies can bind to the flu And then be taken up by other cells that are able to bind those antibodies, the back end, the handle of the fork, and then facilitate uptake and infection of cells that would not normally be infected.
[02:46:00.430 --> 02:46:09.250]  So this is antibody-dependent enhancement, and it's one of many different forms of vaccine-induced enhanced disease.
[02:46:09.250 --> 02:46:10.389]  We've seen this.
[02:46:10.409 --> 02:46:13.569]  It's notorious in respiratory syncytial virus.
[02:46:13.690 --> 02:46:21.670]  This is why the Moderna RSV vaccine was blocked from further testing in young children right now.
[02:46:21.790 --> 02:46:23.010]  This just recently happened.
[02:46:23.870 --> 02:46:49.290]  Okay, so that's one example of how things can go bad if you just say, as Lena Nguyen is saying, oh, it produces antibodies in animals, let's go with it, rather than testing whether or not those are actually good antibodies or there's a strong enough ratio of good antibodies neutralizing to non-neutralizing to prevent this potential problem from becoming clinically significant.
[02:46:49.489 --> 02:46:50.850]  Now, let's go back one.
[02:46:51.379 --> 02:47:15.440]  He was talking about, hopefully I've addressed at least as one example of antibody-enhanced infection and disease, of which influenza was really the original example that brought that concept into widespread recognition within the virology and immunology community and vaccinology community.
[02:47:17.270 --> 02:47:27.129]  Going back to the gain of function research, and rather than picking on Dr. McCullough, this is really not his core competence.
[02:47:27.510 --> 02:47:31.270]  I always defer to him in cardiology and renal biology.
[02:47:32.909 --> 02:47:37.010]  Gain of function research is justified historically.
[02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:57.739]  By the logic that—I'm going to be a little cynical here—the researchers engaging in it are so brilliantly insightful and so committed to better understanding their particular virus.
[02:47:57.940 --> 02:48:07.079]  I mean, this was going on with HIV when I was at UC Davis and other laboratories, gain-of-function research on HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus.
[02:48:07.770 --> 02:48:35.010]  The logic is that it's only by determining what would allow this virus to become more pathogenic that we can anticipate future changes to the virus and identify them when they start to happen so we know which ones are really bad and which ones we can kind of not be so focused on.
[02:48:35.700 --> 02:48:39.059]  So that was the core logic.
[02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:45.899]  And remember that gain-of-function research historically has been done in the same way that we breed animals.
[02:48:46.260 --> 02:48:49.879]  We call it serial passaging in virology.
[02:48:50.420 --> 02:48:59.719]  And it's, by the way, what was used to develop the live-attenuated intranasal vaccine that we call flu mist.
[02:48:59.719 --> 02:49:01.959]  That was developed through serial passage.
[02:49:02.549 --> 02:49:25.750]  But now with modern tech, we can go in and very precisely introduce mutations, one can if you want to do this, and ask the question, if I mutate this in this way, this particular genetic sequence, will it change the infectivity or the pathogenicity of this particular virus in that particular animal model system?
[02:49:26.559 --> 02:49:45.299]  And so this is all justified as necessary and acceptable in the quest for knowledge, but there's also a subtext in many of these laboratories, and they're getting capital, they're getting funding through places like Defense Threat Reduction Agency,
[02:49:45.600 --> 02:49:55.340]  DARPA, and others under the logic in NIH. I mean, this is done with smallpox vaccine and Bernie Moss's lab that came out over the last couple of years, etc.
[02:49:57.389 --> 02:50:06.250]  That these mutations, once we identify them, well, they potentially can be used in a biowarfare product.
[02:50:06.430 --> 02:50:13.370]  And oh, by the way, the biowarfare treaty has a gap in it that's so big you can drive an M1 through it.
[02:50:13.950 --> 02:50:31.350]  And that gap is that if it's a non-lethal pathogen, in other words, if it makes you so sick that you won't pick up your missile launcher and fight, that's acceptable, so long as it doesn't necessarily kill you.
[02:50:31.969 --> 02:50:45.870]  So there's a whole school of research here in which there is R&D on the development of non-lethal infectious disease for biowarfare purposes.
[02:50:46.229 --> 02:50:56.670]  And of course that's happening here, it's happening in Russia, it's happening in China, it's happening throughout the world, and it's also happening in non-governmental countries.
[02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:02.950]  Sure.
[02:51:04.510 --> 02:51:05.909]  Sure.
[02:51:22.979 --> 02:51:24.559]  And better identify them if they develop.
[02:51:24.979 --> 02:51:42.680]  But the other side of that is that this can potentially lead to a bioweapon that may be allowable or, well, the other guys might come up with bioweapons, so we need to come up with a bioweapon in order to counter the bioweapon that the other guys could come up with.
[02:51:43.299 --> 02:51:46.520]  And that is absolutely written into NATO policy.
[02:51:47.040 --> 02:51:49.040]  So there's that point.
[02:51:49.500 --> 02:51:51.340]  And this has been going on for decades.
[02:51:52.329 --> 02:52:09.149]  To be blunt, a good case can be made that modern molecular biology and virology and bacteriology as it exists right now is the consequence of the U.S. government in part having spent far more on biowarfare than it's spent on nuclear weapon development.
[02:52:10.229 --> 02:52:12.090]  That's how deep we are in it.
[02:52:12.649 --> 02:52:20.069]  The heads of the American Society for Microbiology for years and years and years were top guns within the U.S. biowarfare establishment.
[02:52:22.080 --> 02:52:28.739]  So, we've got to be careful about casting stones that this is all the nasty Russians and the nasty Chinese.
[02:52:29.520 --> 02:52:44.440]  We've been doing it absolutely ever since the Second World War, and we built that infrastructure at Fort Detrick, among other places, by importing scientists from Germany and Japan that were very much involved in biowarfare product development.
[02:52:45.819 --> 02:52:47.420]  Now, what was the third question?
[02:52:47.979 --> 02:52:51.500]  Well, I think Alex wanted to know what you anticipate is going to happen next.
[02:52:51.719 --> 02:52:54.219]  We are coming up on a break in about 90 seconds.
[02:52:54.579 --> 02:52:58.899]  I want to keep you for the first five minutes of the next hour, please, if you'll stay with us, Dr. Malone.
[02:52:59.020 --> 02:52:59.819]  This has been fascinating.
[02:52:59.979 --> 02:53:05.780]  But in the first five minutes of the next hour, I want to kind of give you the floor and talk about what you think is going to happen next.
[02:53:05.879 --> 02:53:17.649]  And I also want you to address the question of whether the mRNA technology in vaccines given to Paltry, if that does occur, Can potentially inoculate anyone who eats the poultry?
[02:53:17.829 --> 02:53:18.250]  You mentioned that.
[02:53:18.329 --> 02:53:24.670]  Doesn't seem to be the case right now with the current mRNA from poultry, but maybe from milk specifically, from dairy, that's possible.
[02:53:24.870 --> 02:53:36.489]  But my question for you would be then, similar to how you can buy a semi-automatic rifle that only fires one round every time you pull the trigger, you can modify it just slightly and it becomes an automatic weapon.
[02:53:36.510 --> 02:53:56.190]  Is it possible that even though currently the mRNA vaccines and poultry wouldn't be transmissible to humans from eating that poultry, Is it possible that it could be tweaked or modified in a small way or a substantial way after the infrastructure is in place to inoculate the food supply so that it would inoculate or vaccinate the people who eat the poultry?
[02:53:56.329 --> 02:53:57.610]  So stick with us, Dr. Malone.
[02:53:57.690 --> 02:53:58.750]  Thank you so much for your time.
[02:53:59.010 --> 02:54:01.750]  On the other side, we'll talk about that question, what you think is going to happen next.
[02:54:01.950 --> 02:54:02.909]  Make sure you visit him.
[02:54:03.670 --> 02:54:05.709]  Support him at Malone.News.
[02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:07.049]  Follow him on X as well.
[02:54:07.129 --> 02:54:08.649]  Dr. Malone, it's always an honor and a pleasure to be with you.
[02:54:08.709 --> 02:54:09.709]  Stay with us in two minutes.
[02:54:09.930 --> 02:54:11.270]  We'll unpack that on the other side.
[02:54:11.489 --> 02:54:12.889]  This is a vital transmission.
[02:54:12.930 --> 02:54:14.989]  We are reaching tens of millions of new people a day.
[02:54:15.510 --> 02:54:18.969]  We are one of the most devastating operations of the globalists thanks to your support.
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:21.840]  We need to stay on air.
[02:54:22.020 --> 02:54:23.420]  I make it easy for you to do that.
[02:54:23.579 --> 02:54:27.440]  Do your Christmas shopping at thealexjonesstore.com and at drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:32.459]  And I told you, we're not just going to have Patriot gear and great supplements that are amazing at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:54:33.180 --> 02:54:36.440]  We're going to have made in America, designer knives, collectibles.
[02:54:36.540 --> 02:54:38.020]  We've already had that, but limited supplies.
[02:54:39.629 --> 02:54:45.889]  There's a huge Black Friday Cyber Week sale going 30 to 40% off on top of the big discounts right now.
[02:54:46.209 --> 02:54:47.809]  Do your Christmas shopping with us.
[02:54:47.969 --> 02:54:51.270]  But some amazing new products just came in.
[02:54:52.270 --> 02:54:54.170]  And when I say amazing, I'm excited.
[02:54:54.389 --> 02:54:56.309]  I know these are going to go quickly.
[02:54:57.690 --> 02:54:58.229]  Unfortunately...
[02:54:59.370 --> 02:55:03.209]  This will solve all our problems, but they only made $2,000 in this limited edition.
[02:55:03.690 --> 02:55:09.309]  But it'll go a long way towards our lawsuits and funding our operations and the new network and everything else and keeping InfoWars on it.
[02:55:09.409 --> 02:55:10.129]  That continues.
[02:55:10.329 --> 02:55:11.149]  Look at this bad boy.
[02:55:11.250 --> 02:55:13.989]  The 1984 versus 1776 coin.
[02:55:14.170 --> 02:55:14.790]  I designed it.
[02:55:14.930 --> 02:55:21.209]  There's only 2,000 of these bad boys at TheAlexJonesStore.com and they are a fundraiser.
[02:55:21.350 --> 02:55:22.709]  They are a piece of history.
[02:55:23.090 --> 02:55:24.709]  They are pure silver.
[02:55:25.129 --> 02:55:27.469]  They are minted here in America.
[02:55:28.780 --> 02:55:29.979]  2,000 of these.
[02:55:30.260 --> 02:55:32.399]  I predict these sell out in just a couple days.
[02:55:32.780 --> 02:55:36.799]  This is a great Christmas gift, a memento that you stood for the Republic at a critical time.
[02:55:37.079 --> 02:55:38.059]  They are incredible.
[02:55:38.299 --> 02:55:44.819]  Get the 1984 versus 1776 coin at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:55:44.940 --> 02:55:52.950]  And it's not, the store's not owned by me, so even if the globalists come after us, Even if they take over Infowars next week, they're not going to shut down the Alex Jones store.com.
[02:55:53.090 --> 02:55:56.270]  That is our main sponsor with the Alex Jones Network and everything we're doing going into the future.
[02:55:56.430 --> 02:55:59.209]  So get this amazing coin now.
[02:55:59.370 --> 02:56:13.260]  And if you don't want to, don't have the money to get that because it's marked up for a fundraiser, a memento, a limited edition, We have challenge coins, a whole bunch of them, between 995 and 1495. When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.
[02:56:13.540 --> 02:56:15.860]  And on the other side, it's got the Gadsden flag, don't tread on me.
[02:56:16.459 --> 02:56:18.959]  1776, another one with Alex Jones, yours truly on it.
[02:56:19.100 --> 02:56:21.979]  The answer to 1904 is 1776 with the Gadsden flag.
[02:56:22.379 --> 02:56:24.559]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God on the other side.
[02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:26.399]  And there's some other great challenge coins as well.
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:29.579]  At thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:56:29.639 --> 02:56:31.920]  Now, this is even more exciting.
[02:56:32.139 --> 02:56:33.180]  They surprised me with this.
[02:56:33.239 --> 02:56:34.260]  I just learned this morning.
[02:56:34.260 --> 02:56:38.639]  So it's in the mail from Arkansas where their factory is and their shipping department and all that.
[02:56:38.719 --> 02:56:40.959]  The big lead that owns and runs thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:56:41.100 --> 02:56:46.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump on a Stump, 1995. Everybody loves Elf on a Shelf.
[02:56:46.260 --> 02:56:49.200]  This is Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[02:56:49.340 --> 02:56:51.200]  Oh, my daughter loves Elf on a Shelf.
[02:56:51.399 --> 02:56:53.000]  We play with him and do all sorts of stuff.
[02:56:53.739 --> 02:56:56.040]  Catapult from around the house, play with the cats, play with them.
[02:56:56.559 --> 02:56:59.819]  We've probably got 15 of those Elf on a Shelf, both little elf village in the backyard.
[02:56:59.819 --> 02:57:00.639]  We have a lot of fun.
[02:57:01.079 --> 02:57:04.600]  She puts Christmas tree lights on these little trees we got in the backyard.
[02:57:04.959 --> 02:57:06.659]  Oh my gosh, I've got to have this.
[02:57:06.780 --> 02:57:07.479]  And I already called them.
[02:57:07.659 --> 02:57:09.620]  I said, I want 10 set aside for me.
[02:57:09.659 --> 02:57:10.579]  So that means there's...
[02:57:12.149 --> 02:57:14.010]  1,900 and something of these.
[02:57:14.170 --> 02:57:16.690]  And I'm telling you, this is going to sell out today.
[02:57:17.110 --> 02:57:19.129]  Why they didn't get 20,000 of them, I don't know.
[02:57:19.250 --> 02:57:20.389]  All my problems would be solved.
[02:57:20.549 --> 02:57:21.610]  We would have plenty of fun.
[02:57:21.750 --> 02:57:23.370]  This baby is amazing.
[02:57:23.530 --> 02:57:28.709]  Everybody needs to have this original Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[02:57:28.870 --> 02:57:35.889]  Celebrate Christmas with the Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine, the ultimate conversation starter for your tree or mantle.
[02:57:36.229 --> 02:57:44.040]  Fully Posable and ready to take on the globalist, this festive figure can be positioned in any stance, from bold and defiant to perfectly perched.
[02:57:44.139 --> 02:57:52.200]  Whether you're decking the halls or making a statement, this patriotic decoration will keep the spirit of 1776 alive all season long, right into Trump being inaugurated next month.
[02:57:52.379 --> 02:57:54.000]  Get your Trump on a stump now!
[02:57:54.239 --> 02:58:02.239]  Ultimate CMOS, Patriot gear, amazing hoodies, Christmas sweaters and more, and fund the second American Revolution worldwide at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:58:11.559 --> 02:58:13.799]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:13.979 --> 02:58:16.020]  I am pleased to be joined by Dr. Malone.
[02:58:16.379 --> 02:58:17.659]  It's been an honor and a pleasure to be with you.
[02:58:17.780 --> 02:58:35.040]  We have five minutes together, Dr. Malone, and I want to just give you the floor and let you respond to the question of whether mRNA technology could be tweaked or manipulated to vaccinate those who consume vaccinated livestock.
[02:58:35.559 --> 02:58:50.059]  And I also want you to give your thoughts on So, thanks.
[02:58:50.600 --> 02:58:54.600]  And I want to, something I didn't say in the prior segment that I want to make clear.
[02:58:55.420 --> 02:59:03.100]  I called for the banning of gain-of-function research over two years ago in sworn testimony to the Texas State Senate.
[02:59:03.280 --> 02:59:04.340]  That's still my position.
[02:59:04.639 --> 02:59:13.680]  I think the risks associated with this approach far outweigh the potential benefits, and how many times do we need to learn that lesson?
[02:59:14.340 --> 02:59:28.840]  Now, in terms of what coulda, shoulda, might happen in some future scenario, In Belgium, I was asked the converse of your question, could RNA vaccine technology be made safe?
[02:59:28.979 --> 02:59:33.840]  And my response to the interviewer was, well, if pigs had wings, they might be able to fly.
[02:59:34.180 --> 02:59:42.739]  We're speculating about whether it might be possible at some point in time to modify this tech in order to make it transmissible.
[02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:50.600]  Now, is there any precedent for why that might be considered desirable by the, let's say, funding community?
[02:59:51.340 --> 02:59:52.780]  And the answer is yes.
[02:59:53.059 --> 03:00:01.319]  So my whole career, for most of my career, Charlie Arntzen at University of Arizona was advocating for edible vaccines.
[03:00:01.659 --> 03:00:04.739]  And these are often considered as edible.
[03:00:05.159 --> 03:00:09.079]  He used to be promoting the idea that we would engineer bananas.
[03:00:09.750 --> 03:00:12.590]  To make them an edible vaccine.
[03:00:12.930 --> 03:00:16.290]  People have talked about this for years and years and years.
[03:00:16.409 --> 03:00:24.250]  There's been, I'm sure, hundreds of millions of dollars poured into this, and yet we don't have any edible vaccines.
[03:00:24.250 --> 03:00:25.350]  Why not?
[03:00:25.670 --> 03:00:36.170]  Well, there's this fundamental problem called the gut, and it's designed to break down peptides and proteins so that we can absorb them.
[03:00:36.770 --> 03:00:49.389]  And it turns out to be really hard to make products that will pass through your stomach and your stomach acid and still maintain biologic activity when they get down into your distant intestine.
[03:00:50.079 --> 03:00:55.860]  And so all the hope and fear around edible vaccines so far has not come to pass.
[03:00:56.079 --> 03:01:02.340]  Could it be enabled using a genetic therapy-based approach?
[03:01:02.340 --> 03:01:04.100]  Absolutely could be done.
[03:01:04.940 --> 03:01:05.700]  And...
[03:01:07.089 --> 03:01:15.709]  Could that be implemented by folks that desire to have infectious vaccines?
[03:01:15.969 --> 03:01:26.290]  Well, this is something that Bill Gates is promoting, the idea that we would have a vaccine that could just be administered and you would get that vaccine whether you wanted to or not.
[03:01:26.940 --> 03:01:33.680]  This surreptitious possibility that there might be transmissible, and let's call it what it is.
[03:01:33.799 --> 03:01:39.399]  We're talking about a gene therapy of which vaccination is just one potential indication.
[03:01:39.780 --> 03:01:45.040]  Is it possible that the food supply could be modified to administer such?
[03:01:45.299 --> 03:01:46.059]  Absolutely.
[03:01:47.379 --> 03:01:50.399]  Is it likely that it would be effective?
[03:01:50.620 --> 03:01:57.659]  Well, we have all kinds of biology that makes it so that we're highly resistant to foreign nucleic acids.
[03:01:57.840 --> 03:02:07.600]  If it was that easy to get DNA or RNA into our cells, we would have even more junk DNA and RNA and more mutations than we already do.
[03:02:08.420 --> 03:02:23.299]  So fortunately, we've evolved as a species and as have virtually all other eukaryotes to resist foreign DNA and RNA, but it still gets in and largely we call that viruses.
[03:02:24.309 --> 03:02:25.530]  Now, have I answered your question?
[03:02:25.989 --> 03:02:26.709]  Yeah, that's perfect.
[03:02:26.909 --> 03:02:30.010]  And Dr. Malone, we're coming up on a break in 38 seconds.
[03:02:30.209 --> 03:02:34.469]  This one's just one minute while the radio stations pick us up for six after.
[03:02:34.629 --> 03:02:35.750]  I'd love for you to stay with us.
[03:02:35.809 --> 03:02:48.420]  Thank you so much for being generous with your time for a little while after this one minute break so that you can answer the next part of the question from Alex about The psychological operation that seems to be going on and what you think is going to happen next.
[03:02:48.819 --> 03:02:52.280]  And then give you an opportunity to plug your substack again as well so our audience can support you.
[03:02:52.399 --> 03:02:53.399]  The work you're doing is incredible.
[03:02:53.600 --> 03:03:00.059]  I'm so grateful that you've shared your expertise on this because I am someone as well as many in the audience who needs to be enlightened on these issues.
[03:03:00.200 --> 03:03:00.620]  Thank you so much.
[03:03:00.700 --> 03:03:02.260]  Stay with us for more on the other side, folks.
[03:03:02.739 --> 03:03:05.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:03:05.020 --> 03:03:06.579]  I'm your host, Chase Geyser.
[03:03:07.280 --> 03:03:09.299]  Joined by Dr. Robert Malone.
[03:03:09.559 --> 03:03:11.659]  Fantastic conversation so far.
[03:03:11.819 --> 03:03:14.159]  So grateful to him for his expertise and sharing his time.
[03:03:14.420 --> 03:03:23.959]  Dr. Malone, final thoughts on the psychological operation that seems to be happening around this bird flu right now and what you think the agenda is and what will happen next.
[03:03:25.500 --> 03:03:26.860]  Okay, egregious book plug.
[03:03:27.700 --> 03:03:42.930]  The book is called Sciwar, and I wrote it together with my wife because of what we observed during COVID. In that book, we talk specifically about the work of Alexander Kozmanov,
[03:03:43.049 --> 03:03:50.690]  who is a former Soviet KGB agent that specialized in bio-warfare and the associated psychology.
[03:03:51.010 --> 03:03:58.010]  And he lays out a basically straightforward set of spycraft techniques.
[03:03:58.879 --> 03:04:06.139]  That are used to generate this, what he calls information bioterrorism, I call psychological bioterrorism.
[03:04:06.360 --> 03:04:23.319]  And if you go through what he describes as the standard spycraft for disrupting economies, fragmenting populations, causing economic disruption,
[03:04:23.520 --> 03:04:32.989]  etc., Using fear of infectious disease, this promoted fear, which is what we're absolutely seeing right now with bird flu.
[03:04:33.170 --> 03:04:35.309]  And we saw before with monkeypox.
[03:04:35.489 --> 03:04:39.430]  It was what was played out in COVID. We see it again and again.
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:56.520]  If you go through those steps, you'll observe, and we talk about it in the book, I've talked about it in the substack, laid out what this spycraft is, you'll see that it's exactly parallel to what we're seeing deployed currently and what we've seen in these other cases.
[03:04:56.739 --> 03:04:59.659]  So is this a PSYOP? It absolutely is.
[03:04:59.760 --> 03:05:07.899]  The thing is that this kind of PSYOP or psychological warfare or fifth-generation warfare is a kissing cousin to marketing.
[03:05:08.590 --> 03:05:27.139]  And my sense is that not only is this being deployed by the US government, particularly the intelligence community, together with the defense community, because we now know that NATO has played a big role in what happened with COVID. But it's also now been adopted by the pharmaceutical industry as part of their marketing technology.
[03:05:27.520 --> 03:05:35.559]  And so that's what's getting laid down on us by the likes of Lena Wan and all of her associates.
[03:05:36.079 --> 03:05:48.120]  And if you listen to what they're saying, it's exactly the messaging that they laid down early on with COVID, except they've switched out for a different infectious disease.
[03:05:48.260 --> 03:05:49.020]  Have I answered your question?
[03:05:49.440 --> 03:05:50.139]  Yeah, that's perfect.
[03:05:50.260 --> 03:05:51.180]  So what's going to happen next?
[03:05:53.700 --> 03:06:04.299]  So one of the things that's playing here is that the World Health Organization pandemic treaty is still not approved.
[03:06:04.659 --> 03:06:10.020]  And we're hearing almost nothing from WHO and Tedros.
[03:06:10.159 --> 03:06:14.500]  And I would expect that we would, except there was an election.
[03:06:15.229 --> 03:06:25.510]  And that election has brought into power a group that is not aligned with this kind of psychological manipulation in every way, the censorship, etc.
[03:06:25.850 --> 03:06:44.889]  So I think what we're seeing right now, and if you listen to the Lena Wynn quote clip that's been circulating from Face the Nation, she's advocating that this current administration needs to rush to deploy this product before the new administration comes in in three weeks.
[03:06:45.640 --> 03:06:59.659]  And to rush out diagnostic tests because it's unlikely they're going to be able to jam this through the population once President-elect Trump is confirmed, is sworn in.
[03:06:59.860 --> 03:07:00.059]  So...
[03:07:00.960 --> 03:07:18.219]  I think there's a good chance that we're going to see a lot more of this over the next couple of weeks, and then it's going to suddenly get quenched once President Trump gets sworn in, and hopefully RFK Jr. gets confirmed in the Senate.
[03:07:18.479 --> 03:07:18.840]  Over.
[03:07:19.409 --> 03:07:21.229]  Well, Dr. Malone, thank you so much for your time.
[03:07:21.389 --> 03:07:25.389]  It's been an honor and a pleasure to speak with you, a pleasure to meet you and interact with you for the first time here.
[03:07:25.610 --> 03:07:27.350]  Thank you so much for your time.
[03:07:27.530 --> 03:07:31.290]  I encourage the audience to visit malone.news, show your support.
[03:07:31.469 --> 03:07:35.030]  We know that we are the media now, whether it's Infowars or Dr. Malone or others.
[03:07:35.469 --> 03:07:51.209]  Support Dr. Malone at malone.news by signing up and subscribing to his substack to get this Expert and honest analysis of what's really going on while we are faced with the endless assault of lies from the mainstream media, the government, pundits, you name it,
[03:07:51.270 --> 03:07:51.770]  the deep state.
[03:07:52.129 --> 03:07:53.629]  Thank you so much, Dr. Malone.
[03:07:53.690 --> 03:07:54.549]  I really appreciate it.
[03:07:54.670 --> 03:07:59.329]  Let's go to a report now from Alex Jones with more on the other side.
[03:08:15.850 --> 03:08:16.829]  InfoWars.
[03:08:16.989 --> 03:08:18.590]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:08:19.110 --> 03:08:49.299]  It's Tuesday, December 31st, 2024. The final day of this incredible revolutionary year against tyranny worldwide, where forces of Humans that want prosperity and want justice and want transparency and want free market competitive capitalist systems and who believe In a
[03:08:49.299 --> 03:09:06.420]  pro-human destiny came together, not just in the United States, but all over the world and began overthrowing the globalist systems and not just removing the political operatives of the WEF and the UN and Bill Gates, but actually a global awakening to the death cult.
[03:09:06.520 --> 03:09:10.940]  They really are a anti-human post-industrial eugenics organization.
[03:09:12.689 --> 03:09:22.430]  Now, they're trying to counter us, as they planned decades ago, to do in their own documents by using the fear of viruses to bring in their tyrannical one-world government.
[03:09:22.770 --> 03:09:24.649]  But it's backfiring very, very quickly.
[03:09:24.790 --> 03:09:30.250]  There have been massive developments concerning the attempted launch of their new Plandemic Hysteria.
[03:09:30.930 --> 03:09:40.750]  Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA technologies coming up later on the broadcast today to lay out the facts of how this is a fake psychological warfare operation.
[03:09:41.110 --> 03:09:46.329]  Dr. Peter McCullough has come out with the documents and it's spreading everywhere right now.
[03:09:46.510 --> 03:09:54.969]  One of the top stories on X. And even hitting mainstream news that the new H5N1 was cooked up in US laboratories.
[03:09:54.969 --> 03:09:57.329]  They didn't even cover up the origin of it.
[03:09:57.489 --> 03:09:59.049]  How incredible is that?
[03:09:59.270 --> 03:10:03.670]  So right as they're launching it, it's already blowing up in the global's face.
[03:10:03.909 --> 03:10:06.889]  That and so much more is coming up today.
[03:10:07.190 --> 03:10:09.010]  They tried to pass two weeks ago.
[03:10:09.780 --> 03:10:17.799]  The funding for the current hysteria they're launching and that totally failed because you're awake, you're engaged, you're involved.
[03:10:18.020 --> 03:10:18.840]  We've turned the tide.
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:20.739]  I'm about to break it all down right now.
[03:10:21.049 --> 03:10:29.430]  You know, bird flu or H5N1 influenza has been around for over 100 years, well documented in the scientific literature in the United States.
[03:10:29.610 --> 03:10:54.360]  The most recent outbreak, which is now four years old, we've published, McCullough Foundation has published with first author Nick Holscher, an epidemiologist in the journal Poultry, Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences, peer-reviewed journal, that the current strain of bird flu It is a product of gain-of-function research done in the USDA Poultry Research Laboratory in Athens,
[03:10:54.760 --> 03:10:55.020]  Georgia.
[03:10:55.020 --> 03:11:00.840]  So it is a man-made problem that our farms are experiencing right now.
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:13.739]  It's in the peer-reviewed literature, and it's really, you know, the next steps in this outbreak is for people to understand, you know, the ramifications of it personally and how to be prepared.
[03:11:14.219 --> 03:11:14.940]  It is.
[03:11:15.440 --> 03:11:30.420]  The circulating clade, which is kind of the original source strain, is clade 2344B. And again, that is a product of what's called serial passage gain-of-function research done at the USDA Poultry Research Laboratory.
[03:11:30.420 --> 03:11:37.250]  It was assisted by University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine and Rotterdam University.
[03:11:38.069 --> 03:11:45.649]  The gain of function was to get it to spread from chickens into migratory waterfowl or mallard ducks.
[03:11:45.850 --> 03:11:48.530]  And so that's how it's spreading across the world now.
[03:11:48.670 --> 03:11:49.889]  It's been spreading for four years.
[03:11:50.090 --> 03:12:00.790]  It continually reinfects the farms because the mallard ducks fly around and they land in ponds on farms and they easily infect the other animals on the farm.
[03:12:00.829 --> 03:12:06.600]  So it was able to In a sense, expand the host range, even into cattle and to sea mammals.
[03:12:07.079 --> 03:12:13.079]  Now, the good news is it's much milder than bird flu of decades ago.
[03:12:13.239 --> 03:12:16.319]  And there's the peer-reviewed paper by Nick Kolsher on this.
[03:12:16.940 --> 03:12:22.399]  And this has not been denied by the USDA Poultry Research Center.
[03:12:22.799 --> 03:12:30.780]  McCullough Foundation attended the bird flu summits in both University of Arkansas as well as in Washington, D.C. So there's no denial of this.
[03:12:30.879 --> 03:12:38.899]  Just like COVID-19, the bird flu problem is a man-made problem by the U.S. government.
[03:12:39.680 --> 03:12:41.799]  Out of the gates, they're trying to launch this new pandemic.
[03:12:42.299 --> 03:12:49.139]  And we already know that it was manmade and even where it was made in US bio labs in the name of bio defense.
[03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:51.200]  It's all part of a larger psyop.
[03:12:51.260 --> 03:12:56.219]  But if you're aware of the psyop, it doesn't work on the population and backfires on those that launched it.
[03:12:56.459 --> 03:13:00.180]  We spent $176 million with Moderna this summer.
[03:13:00.670 --> 03:13:06.370]  To basically pay them to build up their manufacturing capacity for a vaccine that hasn't even been approved.
[03:13:06.770 --> 03:13:09.850]  These haven't even undergone phase 3 clinical trials.
[03:13:10.069 --> 03:13:11.110]  Why is that important?
[03:13:11.489 --> 03:13:23.950]  And whether it integrates into your DNA or not, something that we're now finding out that they did because SV40 contamination is less relevant than whether or not it is a gene therapy by definition.
[03:13:23.950 --> 03:13:24.590]  It is.
[03:13:24.909 --> 03:13:36.909]  Now we know because I have the FDA documents that show That with gene therapies, there is the potential for what's called a delayed adverse event, delayed adverse reactions.
[03:13:37.370 --> 03:13:49.709]  That means that three, five, ten years down the road, you can get, according to the FDA, autoimmune disorders, you can get issues with cancer, all sorts of different things.
[03:13:49.850 --> 03:13:57.629]  To them being able to get away with their lies about this being an emergency is that everybody starts getting PCR tests again.
[03:13:58.100 --> 03:14:05.360]  If they PCR test everything, the thing about PCR is if you run it at a high enough cycle threshold, you'll find anything you wanna find.
[03:14:05.680 --> 03:14:15.180]  They admitted that, we found that during COVID. So they can find exposure to anything they wanna find if they run a certain type of PCR test at a certain type of cycle threshold.
[03:14:15.500 --> 03:14:21.840]  So they want testing because then they can say, there's 100 million cases of the bird flu, we're all gonna die.
[03:14:22.040 --> 03:14:28.950]  And everybody that dies, they can label a bird flu death, just like they did with COVID. Then they can try and mandate the flu vaccines.
[03:14:29.309 --> 03:14:43.969]  So on this historic December 31st, 2024 transmission, the last day of this incredible year of the populist uprising against the globalists worldwide, let me just restate some key facts here.
[03:14:44.290 --> 03:14:49.750]  All right, I know almost all of you already understand this, but I want people to see this in its totality, then we're going to walk through it.
[03:14:50.729 --> 03:15:01.090]  They tried to pass a spending bill two weeks ago that would give them all this unconstitutional martial law, medical tyranny, powers, and the funding.
[03:15:01.250 --> 03:15:01.950]  That failed.
[03:15:02.090 --> 03:15:09.850]  But they already had the PSYOP rolling out that Tedros, the WHO, and Dr. Hotez and others a month ago were bragging about.
[03:15:10.290 --> 03:15:13.229]  Don't worry, we're gonna maintain our control over the world.
[03:15:13.430 --> 03:15:16.209]  There's gonna be a new pandemic or pandemics.
[03:15:16.209 --> 03:15:19.889]  There's a secret disease in the Congo killing everybody with blood coming out of their eyes.
[03:15:20.489 --> 03:15:21.530]  Turned out that was all a lie.
[03:15:21.530 --> 03:15:22.350]  It was malaria.
[03:15:22.750 --> 03:15:24.790]  They tried mpox and monkeypox.
[03:15:24.950 --> 03:15:26.469]  It was just changing the name the last few years.
[03:15:26.950 --> 03:15:30.350]  Nothing is working because the vast majority of people see through it.
[03:15:30.510 --> 03:15:34.370]  They're only getting a two to four percent uptake on their new COVID shots.
[03:15:34.690 --> 03:15:38.309]  So they tried to use their disease X for total control and it backfired.
[03:15:38.469 --> 03:15:40.870]  So their big funding operation just failed.
[03:15:41.450 --> 03:15:45.649]  Now it's coming out that the bird flu current strain is man-made by the US government.
[03:15:46.110 --> 03:15:49.750]  Again, top scientists and experts are pointing out it's all a giant psyop.
[03:15:49.870 --> 03:15:56.409]  They're now admitting these so-called vaccines they've got actually will cause leaky vaccine and cause deadly virus mutations.
[03:15:57.030 --> 03:16:00.510]  Everything's blowing up in their face as they try to launch this new operation.
[03:16:00.829 --> 03:16:03.290]  That's why this is so important, but they got tricks up their sleeve.
[03:16:03.850 --> 03:16:05.409]  Now, I want to be very, very clear.
[03:16:06.569 --> 03:16:10.309]  Yes, it's good news that most people are not buying any of this garbage.
[03:16:11.459 --> 03:16:17.659]  And it's good news that it's coming out day one, that it's manmade, and of course, connected to our criminal federal government.
[03:16:18.959 --> 03:16:31.700]  And yes, it's great news, even mainline scientists are saying, how can you have a bunch of different companies with a bird flu vaccine that doesn't even cover some magic mutation we're not sure is even coming?
[03:16:33.819 --> 03:16:36.760]  And then give people a shot that won't even protect them from that.
[03:16:36.899 --> 03:16:40.899]  None of this even makes sense on its face, but it's not meant to.
[03:16:41.059 --> 03:16:43.700]  It's, again, a giant psyop.
[03:16:43.879 --> 03:17:04.610]  And what Dr. Peter McCullough and others have broken down, and we've shown these graphics, we'll show them again, and we posted them on Infowars.com and at RealAlexJonesOnX, you can check it for yourself, is they have the history of these mutations, and we know that that was being researched at these labs, and then virologists were able to look at that and see that it's clearly been accelerated In its evolution.
[03:17:04.909 --> 03:17:17.530]  And then if you give people these experimental shots while the wild viruses are out there, it will cause them to have more accelerated evolution or the popular parlance leaky vaccine.
[03:17:17.850 --> 03:17:20.190]  So this is the worst thing they could do.
[03:17:21.370 --> 03:17:33.250]  Even if they weren't the ones that made this new H1N1 that they're now sitting back saying is about to jump into humans in a really bad way because they've got the next version clearly on the shelf, which they admit they have.
[03:17:33.469 --> 03:17:35.909]  I mean, these people aren't even hiding this stuff.
[03:17:36.030 --> 03:17:39.809]  And if they don't start going to prison, they're gonna release something far worse on us.
[03:17:40.020 --> 03:17:44.399]  If it mutates like it did in this individual or in the case in Canada.
[03:17:44.700 --> 03:17:47.659]  But that sometimes is a random slower process.
[03:17:47.760 --> 03:17:52.020]  But if you have that co-infection, then you can share genes.
[03:17:52.659 --> 03:18:02.500]  And that's a really, to me, the spring and the summer where we had all of the dairy cattle to farm worker exposure, we didn't have human flu circulating.
[03:18:03.090 --> 03:18:11.590]  So now we're entering a much more dangerous period, yet we're still not testing and we should be providing tests free of charge.
[03:18:11.870 --> 03:18:19.590]  So, given this double whammy that you laid out, do you think it's just a matter of time until there's just a full-fledged pandemic here?
[03:18:21.079 --> 03:18:31.920]  Well, certainly we're setting ourselves up for that potential, which, you know, I flash back to January of 2020, and I'm hearing the same words come out of the CDC. Like what?
[03:18:32.159 --> 03:18:32.940]  Low risk.
[03:18:33.180 --> 03:18:35.719]  Low risk human-to-human transmission.
[03:18:36.020 --> 03:18:42.520]  Didn't we hear that from the WHO and the CDC about COVID? You don't see a virus through a symptoms.
[03:18:42.520 --> 03:18:44.739]  You see the virus through the test.
[03:18:44.739 --> 03:18:48.879]  And we know from COVID, most of the spread was asymptomatic.
[03:18:49.420 --> 03:18:50.579]  So let's recap.
[03:18:52.090 --> 03:18:53.729]  We've shot down their funding for this.
[03:18:53.909 --> 03:18:55.610]  We've shot down their global UN treaty.
[03:18:56.329 --> 03:19:04.670]  You've had their spokespersons like Tedros and Burks and Hotez running around saying, don't worry, a new pandemic's coming.
[03:19:05.309 --> 03:19:06.709]  That's how we'll keep control.
[03:19:06.930 --> 03:19:08.389]  It's gonna come crashing in on Trump.
[03:19:08.530 --> 03:19:16.709]  They don't even hide the fact to their political minions that, hey, they're doing this for political power and, hey, wear the mask and keep America shut down.
[03:19:17.540 --> 03:19:26.780]  And that's a huge takeaway that the left, a lot of them are actually conscious of this and love the cult's power and enjoy being abused by it because they have Mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[03:19:27.219 --> 03:19:42.620]  Then you've got the fact that these new variants are clearly man-made of H5N1. Then you've got them wanting to give people all these new experimental shots they've got that don't even protect you but will mutate the wild virus on record to make it way worse.
[03:19:43.459 --> 03:19:46.520]  And then you've got all this coming out and the whole world seeing it.
[03:19:47.159 --> 03:19:49.700]  And Bill Gates running around saying, don't worry, a new virus is coming.
[03:19:49.799 --> 03:19:50.840]  It's going to kill a bunch of kids.
[03:19:50.959 --> 03:19:52.100]  So you better do what we say.
[03:19:52.299 --> 03:19:59.399]  I mean, they're openly got a gun to our head saying we're going to basically shut down society and kill you if you don't submit to us.
[03:19:59.559 --> 03:20:01.739]  But even if you submit to us, we're still going to do it anyway.
[03:20:01.739 --> 03:20:02.780]  So they give us no choice.
[03:20:03.510 --> 03:20:04.690]  So this is an epic moment.
[03:20:04.809 --> 03:20:05.409]  We are winning.
[03:20:05.889 --> 03:20:09.569]  But I just sit back and think, what are they going to do now?
[03:20:09.870 --> 03:20:11.469]  And we still haven't defeated this yet.
[03:20:11.670 --> 03:20:13.010]  They're trying to roll it out.
[03:20:13.409 --> 03:20:16.549]  It's not working, but the blue cities and states are declaring their emergencies.
[03:20:16.850 --> 03:20:18.569]  It's also happening in Europe and Australia.
[03:20:18.709 --> 03:20:24.049]  And we just have to get this information out and take these big interviews with scientists like Dr. Robert Malone coming up later.
[03:20:24.940 --> 03:20:32.200]  Peter McCullough yesterday and shared them everywhere because this type of evil psyop cannot survive the light of truth.
[03:20:32.420 --> 03:20:34.620]  So this is your mission if you choose to accept it.
[03:20:34.700 --> 03:20:39.020]  If not, we are in for lockdowns, tyranny, way worse than we saw in the last five years.
[03:20:39.340 --> 03:20:43.120]  What should be happening in the Biden administration right now that isn't going on?
[03:20:43.520 --> 03:20:47.139]  Yeah, there are two main things that they should be doing in the days that they have left.
[03:20:47.360 --> 03:20:49.440]  The first is to get testing out there.
[03:20:49.659 --> 03:20:55.620]  I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that just because we aren't testing, it doesn't mean that the virus isn't there.
[03:20:55.780 --> 03:20:57.340]  It just means that we aren't looking for it.
[03:20:57.479 --> 03:21:10.340]  We should be having rapid tests, home tests available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not.
[03:21:10.600 --> 03:21:15.819]  And the second very important thing is this is not like the beginning of COVID where we were dealing with a new virus.
[03:21:15.940 --> 03:21:16.840]  We didn't have a vaccine.
[03:21:17.040 --> 03:21:26.899]  There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1. The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses of the vaccine.
[03:21:27.159 --> 03:21:30.819]  However, they have not asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine.
[03:21:31.020 --> 03:21:32.260]  There's research done on it.
[03:21:32.360 --> 03:21:38.500]  They could get this authorized now and also get the vaccine out and to farm workers and to vulnerable people.
[03:21:38.979 --> 03:21:43.680]  I think that's the right approach because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu.
[03:21:43.920 --> 03:21:48.879]  If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization?
[03:21:49.280 --> 03:21:54.280]  If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing?
[03:21:54.579 --> 03:21:56.399]  I mean, that's a possibility.
[03:21:56.719 --> 03:22:05.059]  To me, the spring and the summer where we had all of the dairy cattle to farm worker exposure, we didn't have human flu circulating.
[03:22:05.340 --> 03:22:10.979]  So now we're entering a much more dangerous period, yet we're still not testing.
[03:22:11.239 --> 03:22:19.180]  And we should be providing tests free of charge to dairy farm workers so they can test anonymously weekly because they'll want to know.
[03:22:19.840 --> 03:22:26.059]  If they have both cases of potential flus co-circulating in their own body to protect their families.
[03:22:26.059 --> 03:22:27.120]  People are very smart.
[03:22:27.260 --> 03:22:29.760]  I find the American public to be incredibly smart.
[03:22:29.760 --> 03:22:36.700]  If you tell them the risk and you give them the tools, they will utilize them to protect themselves and their family.
[03:22:37.340 --> 03:22:50.969]  Now, a lot of people ask me the question, if this whole biomedical system is being used by the globalists, as they admit it is, to try to bring in total control over society, And depopulate and take control of our bodies.
[03:22:51.450 --> 03:22:54.569]  Why, if it's been exposed, are they still running their operation?
[03:22:54.850 --> 03:23:12.530]  Because they built their whole globalist architecture at the UN and the WHO and these corporations to take control using a disease X. That's how I predicted it all decades ago and laid out the lockdowns and the six feet apart and the mask and the shots and the quarantine camps because they'd wargamed it.
[03:23:12.590 --> 03:23:14.530]  They'd said they were going to use it for total control.
[03:23:14.870 --> 03:23:22.180]  And then when they collapsed the third world from the lockdowns, And people starve to death, and we get flooded by the third world, they say, oh, it's global warming causing it.
[03:23:22.340 --> 03:23:33.899]  And when they say, oh, by 2030, there'll be mass depopulation from global warming, no, that's because of their policies cutting off the resources, cutting off the energy, cutting off the fertilizers, and that causes a collapse.
[03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:36.920]  And they say, oh, look, global warming, man-made, you caused it.
[03:23:37.549 --> 03:23:38.690]  This is their plan.
[03:23:38.930 --> 03:23:43.610]  This is the Rio de Janeiro post-industrial 1992 meeting.
[03:23:43.969 --> 03:23:47.569]  And this is Limits to Growth and the Club of Rome and their own admissions.
[03:23:47.569 --> 03:23:56.549]  Go watch the WHO or the WEF. I mean, go to the World Economic Forum and all of them.
[03:23:56.629 --> 03:23:58.889]  And they admit all of this.
[03:24:00.229 --> 03:24:03.489]  And so finally people are going, wow, these people really are evil.
[03:24:03.569 --> 03:24:04.329]  They really are doing this.
[03:24:04.409 --> 03:24:05.110]  And I'm like, yeah!
[03:24:05.370 --> 03:24:07.110]  And let's organize and oppose it.
[03:24:07.190 --> 03:24:07.989]  And that's happening.
[03:24:08.510 --> 03:24:09.530]  Last day of the year.
[03:24:09.709 --> 03:24:10.850]  So much more coming.
[03:24:11.030 --> 03:24:13.510]  Please stay with us and share the live links right now from Alex Jones.
[03:24:13.690 --> 03:24:16.770]  We reached tens of millions of new people yesterday because of you sharing the links.
[03:24:16.829 --> 03:24:18.350]  Let's do it again and let's stop these monsters.
[03:24:20.530 --> 03:24:28.069]  Ladies and gentlemen, we know there is an all-out assault on our health, our bodies, our freedoms, our liberties, you name it.
[03:24:28.170 --> 03:24:32.309]  Anything that is sacred is being assaulted right now by the New World Order and the globalists.
[03:24:32.569 --> 03:24:44.389]  Now, most recently, we have seen that the mainstream media, healthcare executives, big pharmaceutical companies and pundits and representatives and special interests have been exaggerating the claims of the dangers of this bird flu.
[03:24:45.170 --> 03:24:52.450]  Now, we know that the bird flu is not a threat, and we know that the response to pandemics tends to be much more of a threat than the pandemics themselves.
[03:24:52.829 --> 03:24:59.930]  We know that the vaccines, for example, and COVID-19 were more harmful than COVID-19 itself, and the same thing is true.
[03:25:01.180 --> 03:25:03.620]  Of what they're planning to do with this bird flu.
[03:25:03.819 --> 03:25:14.399]  They want to inoculate, to vaccinate all of our food supply in the name of saving the livestock, saving the food supply from being eradicated by these viruses, which they have engineered.
[03:25:15.079 --> 03:25:24.159]  And they wanna inoculate, vaccinate our food supply with new technology, new vaccines that can infect those who consume the food.
[03:25:24.870 --> 03:25:36.889]  That's why it's more important now than ever that you fight for your gut, that you protect your gut, because as Dr. Malone said, our gut is the reason it's been so difficult for them to inoculate us and vaccinate us involuntarily.

[03:27:13.159 --> 03:27:15.139]  The U.S. trustee's still been left there, though it was over.
[03:27:16.549 --> 03:27:19.590]  The judge said you're actually gonna sell it to who actually offers the most money.
[03:27:20.030 --> 03:27:25.350]  We're gonna work on that with outside groups that won't censor us, but who knows what Soros and Bloomberg are gonna do.
[03:27:26.239 --> 03:27:27.979]  But regardless, we continue on.
[03:27:28.059 --> 03:27:29.120]  The info war is you.
[03:27:29.200 --> 03:27:29.520]  It's me.
[03:27:29.600 --> 03:27:30.219]  It's the people.
[03:27:30.239 --> 03:27:30.979]  It's questioning.

[03:28:09.010 --> 03:28:09.229]  Merry Christmas!
[03:28:12.459 --> 03:28:21.639]  The globalist COVID tyrants are making their move again, but this time the people of the world are awake and are standing up against it.
[03:28:22.079 --> 03:28:34.120]  The last five years of their criminal power grab has already blown up in their face, but they're so desperate they have no other moves to make and are trying to run the same play again.
[03:28:34.420 --> 03:28:40.920]  This is going to be their Waterloo if we get the facts and raise the alarm to the people of the world now.
[03:28:50.180 --> 03:28:52.079]  So many things can come out of this.
[03:28:52.219 --> 03:28:57.139]  I think the main points are we're ahead of any type of government narrative.
[03:28:57.399 --> 03:29:02.120]  This came out of a laboratory that all the evidence points to that.
[03:29:02.520 --> 03:29:05.100]  It's being spread by migratory waterfowl.
[03:29:05.239 --> 03:29:08.000]  What happens from here, John, is very interesting.
[03:29:09.059 --> 03:29:13.040]  The migratory waterfowl, don't forget, are not being culled.
[03:29:13.280 --> 03:29:14.739]  So they're flying around.
[03:29:14.920 --> 03:29:18.040]  What's going to happen is invariably they're going to get natural immunity.
[03:29:18.659 --> 03:29:19.680]  Which is very interesting.
[03:29:19.860 --> 03:29:22.940]  So if they get natural immunity, this thing could die off on its own.
[03:29:23.319 --> 03:29:27.340]  The second point is that the human cases haven't been too impressive.
[03:29:27.659 --> 03:29:35.979]  And unless we actually start to get really serious pulmonary cases in humans, The public's not gonna be moved by this.
[03:29:36.180 --> 03:29:45.680]  It's Monday, December 30th, 2024. We're only 22 days out from the inauguration of President Trump.
[03:29:45.940 --> 03:29:58.459]  And right on time, as we predicted, and as the bad guys began admitting a month ago, they are rolling out the official bird flu hysteria.
[03:29:59.260 --> 03:30:01.579]  Now, here's the good news.
[03:30:02.159 --> 03:30:17.440]  People are way more aware and awake than they were five years ago the last time they rolled out this Global Disease X in the UN's own admission as a plan to set up their corporate world government and their cashless society attached to the vaccine passport.
[03:30:18.190 --> 03:30:20.010]  System for the social credit score.
[03:30:20.250 --> 03:30:36.750]  And just two weeks ago, they tried to pass the pandemic legislation in the big spending bill that mirrored the UN treaty that also failed this year to give them draconian powers for lockdowns, forced injections, forced masking,
[03:30:37.350 --> 03:30:39.670]  total liability protection for their poison shots.
[03:30:39.850 --> 03:30:40.790]  That failed.
[03:30:41.379 --> 03:30:48.819]  And they tried lockdowns last year, if you remember, but we got ahead of it, and Trump said they're doing this ahead of the election to try to steal it, so they're gonna have mail-in ballots.
[03:30:49.020 --> 03:30:51.000]  There was major political, cultural pressure.
[03:30:51.100 --> 03:30:52.260]  They had to back off of that.
[03:30:52.559 --> 03:30:56.180]  But this time, they are coming in harder than ever.
[03:30:56.200 --> 03:31:12.840]  So if we expose the past fraud and the current fraud that I'm about to lay out, we don't have just a very good chance of stopping this huge PSYOP. We will stop it, but this is meant to block Not just the American awakening of populism and the Great Awakening, but the global Great Awakening.
[03:31:13.020 --> 03:31:16.219]  And the usual suspects are out there pushing the lies.
[03:31:16.360 --> 03:31:18.520]  We're about to break it all down right now.
[03:31:18.739 --> 03:31:24.680]  We have some big picture stuff coming down the pike starting on January 21st.
[03:31:25.079 --> 03:31:29.059]  Mr. Bloomberg mentioned H5N1. That I'm really worried about.
[03:31:29.200 --> 03:31:34.739]  It's all over wild birds on the western part of the United States and going up in the north.
[03:31:34.739 --> 03:31:36.040]  It's getting into the poultry.
[03:31:36.360 --> 03:31:42.979]  You can see that they're monitoring more than 10,000 exposures, but they've only tested 530. What does that mean?
[03:31:43.180 --> 03:31:44.620]  That means we're not testing enough.
[03:31:44.799 --> 03:31:48.479]  And we know from other viruses that a lot of the spread can be asymptomatic.
[03:31:48.700 --> 03:32:00.360]  And I think the Biden administration in the remaining days should get testing and vaccines widely available so that at least it empowers state and local health officials and clinicians to do the right thing for their patients.
[03:32:00.540 --> 03:32:05.260]  All that's gonna come crashing down on January 21st on the Trump administration.
[03:32:05.420 --> 03:32:08.799]  We need a really, really good team to be able to handle this.
[03:32:09.040 --> 03:32:21.879]  Deborah Birx, Lena Nguyen, Peter Hotez, all the usual suspects right out of Fauci's operation are all over television telling us This new bird flu is here.
[03:32:22.079 --> 03:32:26.959]  It could mutate any minute and just destroy us all, but don't you worry.
[03:32:27.239 --> 03:32:44.940]  The Biden administration over the last year has spent hundreds and millions of dollars going out to all these different so-called vaccine makers, including Moderna, with an mRNA experimental gene therapy, and a whole bunch of other foreign countries are developing mRNA for the bird flu,
[03:32:45.260 --> 03:33:02.930]  and that they're gonna have it ready for you, and now we have Burks and Wynn and all the usual suspects saying we need emergency authorization From the FDA right now for these stockpiles of so-called vaccines they've made,
[03:33:03.149 --> 03:33:21.510]  there's more than 10 different companies that I just looked up this morning that are doing it, to then rush these directly untested to the public when the mainline science on its face shows that if you don't have the exact mutation of whatever they say the bird flu is gonna mutate into,
[03:33:21.809 --> 03:33:32.879]  the shot doesn't just not protect you, but it causes what they call A leaky vaccine or accelerated evolution or mutation.
[03:33:32.879 --> 03:33:41.479]  When you give people these different experimental shots, supposedly suppressing those viruses, it makes them mutate faster.
[03:33:42.180 --> 03:33:49.659]  And we've got scientists and experts and researchers and doctors coming on throughout the week to be talking about that on my show.
[03:33:49.680 --> 03:33:52.639]  But you can just look up leaky vaccines for yourself.
[03:33:52.840 --> 03:33:54.280]  It's kind of a non-threatening name.
[03:33:54.379 --> 03:33:55.280]  Oh, it's just a leaky vaccine.
[03:33:55.440 --> 03:34:02.899]  No, it means it makes new mutations that are worse, which is what they're warning us the bird flu is about to do.
[03:34:03.760 --> 03:34:06.520]  This new H5N1 and all the rest of this.
[03:34:06.659 --> 03:34:10.899]  So any basic science, any basic research of this shows you how crazy it is.
[03:34:11.040 --> 03:34:15.360]  We're about to lay out some of the history of these fearmongers, what they're doing now and how we stop them.
[03:34:15.440 --> 03:34:20.540]  My main concern is that we're not going to reach herd immunity because of vaccine hesitancy.
[03:34:20.940 --> 03:34:25.059]  And I know that's hard for a lot of people to believe who desperately want the vaccine right now.
[03:34:25.280 --> 03:34:29.340]  And they're thinking, oh, well, it's just a small percentage of people who are actually anti-vaxxers.
[03:34:29.479 --> 03:34:30.120]  And that's true.
[03:34:30.280 --> 03:34:32.840]  There is the anti-science, anti-vaxxer contingent.
[03:34:32.920 --> 03:34:41.500]  But I think that there are many more people, millions of people who, for whatever reason, have concerns about the vaccine, who just don't know what's in it for them.
[03:34:41.659 --> 03:34:46.739]  And we need to make it clear to them that the vaccine is the ticket back to pre-pandemic life.
[03:34:47.219 --> 03:34:49.159]  And the window to do that is really narrowing.
[03:34:49.299 --> 03:34:52.120]  I mean, you were mentioning, Chris, about how all these states are reopening.
[03:34:52.360 --> 03:34:53.979]  They're reopening at 100%.
[03:34:53.979 --> 03:34:59.659]  And we have a very narrow window to tie reopening policy to vaccination status.
[03:34:59.840 --> 03:35:03.700]  Because otherwise, if everything is reopened, then what's the carrot going to be?
[03:35:03.940 --> 03:35:06.639]  How are we going to incentivize people to actually get the vaccine?
[03:35:06.899 --> 03:35:14.610]  So that's why I think the CDC and the Biden administration needs to come out a lot bolder and say, if you're vaccinated, You can do all these things.
[03:35:14.950 --> 03:35:20.430]  I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection, and I think we overplayed the vaccines.
[03:35:20.590 --> 03:35:23.950]  So I am very worried that we just don't.
[03:35:24.549 --> 03:35:29.729]  As a nation, we haven't made that commitment to really fully protect American people.
[03:35:29.989 --> 03:35:43.889]  We caught up with internationally recognized dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor and co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, Dr. Peter Hotez, who's traveling to get his take on the topic.
[03:35:44.170 --> 03:35:52.129]  We have a likelihood that new pandemic threats, people call it disease X, are going to be rising on a regular basis.
[03:35:52.430 --> 03:35:58.090]  And Dr. Hotez says disease X, the next pandemic, could hit hard whenever it arrives.
[03:35:58.579 --> 03:36:05.000]  Why do you think some experts are predicting the next pandemic will make COVID-19 look like a walk in the park?
[03:36:05.459 --> 03:36:06.979]  I've written about this as well.
[03:36:07.100 --> 03:36:11.879]  I wrote for the Houston Chronicle a couple of months back that COVID-19 issues the warm-up act.
[03:36:12.700 --> 03:36:16.600]  The next pandemic may not be as severe, but it could be much more severe.
[03:36:16.959 --> 03:36:23.860]  You cannot make the conclusion that the vaccine will do better than natural infection, although it can often do slightly better.
[03:36:24.059 --> 03:36:36.639]  But I think that's, I mean, you're an expert, you were on the task force, you were part of this effort when you were in the previous administration, and you're saying in this administration that you can't rule out the fact that our government was lying to us when they told us the vaccinated could not get the virus.
[03:36:36.940 --> 03:36:40.120]  I don't know about their discussions that they had in the task force.
[03:36:40.379 --> 03:36:42.000]  So I can't tell you that.
[03:36:42.120 --> 03:36:48.139]  I can tell you as a family member who had individuals that were susceptible, of course we got everybody vaccinated.
[03:36:48.260 --> 03:36:57.299]  But we still use layered protection during surges because I knew potentially the vaccine immunity would wane like natural immunity waned.
[03:36:57.379 --> 03:37:02.180]  And there was evidence that every four months, reinfection was occurring in South Africa.
[03:37:02.360 --> 03:37:02.739]  Wow.
[03:37:03.450 --> 03:37:07.809]  When the government told us that the vaccinated couldn't transmit it, was that a lie or was that a guess?
[03:37:08.069 --> 03:37:09.290]  Or is it the same answer?
[03:37:10.149 --> 03:37:11.709]  I think it was hope.
[03:37:12.389 --> 03:37:14.389]  That the vaccine would work in that way.
[03:37:14.809 --> 03:37:22.690]  And that's why I think scientists and public health leaders always have to be at the table, being very clear what we know and what we don't know.
[03:37:22.709 --> 03:37:24.309]  This is important for the country to know.
[03:37:24.450 --> 03:37:31.569]  So when I asked the question, when the government told us that the vaccinated couldn't get it, and I asked you if it was a guess or a lie, you said you don't know.
[03:37:31.829 --> 03:37:33.430]  You said you think it was hope.
[03:37:33.610 --> 03:37:35.729]  So what we do know is it wasn't the truth.
[03:37:35.909 --> 03:37:54.459]  So they were either guessing, lying, or hoping, and communicating that information to the to the citizens of this country I think they were hoping, but you should know in those original phase 3 trials that were done in this country, that we only measured for symptomatic disease.
[03:37:54.979 --> 03:38:02.780]  So we weren't proactively testing everybody in those trials to see if they got infected with mild or asymptomatic disease.
[03:38:03.120 --> 03:38:06.219]  And so people had to present within the clinical trial.
[03:38:06.559 --> 03:38:11.239]  So we never had the data that it was going to protect against asymptomatic infection.
[03:38:11.260 --> 03:38:12.299]  I'm just struck with the irony.
[03:38:38.610 --> 03:38:39.590]  Don't forget.
[03:38:40.500 --> 03:38:42.100]  This point's gotta be made over and over again.
[03:38:42.600 --> 03:38:59.659]  Just two weeks ago, they tried in the big spending bill to add Draconian civil emergency martial law provisions for a new pandemic and tens of billions of dollars more to fund their operations.
[03:39:00.040 --> 03:39:11.139]  That failed because the public is awake and because Trump supporters and Elon Musk and our listeners and others put pressure on them and shot down the legislation.
[03:39:11.340 --> 03:39:13.219]  The UN global treaty has failed.
[03:39:14.200 --> 03:39:25.819]  They've come out and said, don't worry, a new pandemic's coming, Bill Gates, Hotez, all of them, and that will teach you to get in line and do what they say.
[03:39:26.219 --> 03:39:30.780]  What did Trump do last year when I raised the alarm and when this great audience of activists raised the alarm?
[03:39:31.409 --> 03:39:36.370]  About them trying to roll out the inbox, the new monkey pox, the bird for the rest of it.
[03:39:36.450 --> 03:39:38.190]  We said we've got to get ahead of this and expose it.
[03:39:38.290 --> 03:39:42.809]  Trump came out and said they're doing this so they can have mail-in ballots coming to the election.
[03:39:42.989 --> 03:39:44.010]  We exposed it.
[03:39:44.569 --> 03:39:45.469]  It failed.
[03:39:45.690 --> 03:39:47.209]  So we attacked the PCR test.
[03:39:47.270 --> 03:39:47.809]  It's a fraud.
[03:39:48.170 --> 03:39:51.829]  Notice Berks was on national TV saying we've got to have the PCR test.
[03:39:52.129 --> 03:39:54.030]  You know, we've got to create the fear.
[03:39:54.629 --> 03:39:57.709]  You've got to go out and test people and claim it's jumped to humans.
[03:39:57.989 --> 03:40:02.010]  It's preposterous how obvious all of this is.
[03:40:02.110 --> 03:40:12.530]  And that's why I've said they've got to go to prison, not just for the millions that died from the poison shot, the millions that died around the world for lack of medical care, but so this same group of criminals can't do this again.
[03:40:12.729 --> 03:40:21.870]  The UN documents came out decades ago that they would use the threat of a pandemic to bring in world government and have it six feet apart and wearing masks and forced injections and quarantine centers.
[03:40:21.989 --> 03:40:34.969]  They've built Under UN auspices, all these emergency pandemic camps around the world, this is their smokescreen for global totalitarianism to stop the global awakening.
[03:40:35.250 --> 03:40:40.350]  So we don't just call for saying no to this new hysteria and fear and stopping the new emergencies and declaring.
[03:40:40.590 --> 03:40:46.110]  We also demand prosecution of Fauci and the rest of them, and their whole house of cards will collapse.
[03:40:46.110 --> 03:40:47.510]  It's us or them.
[03:40:48.090 --> 03:40:54.030]  We have some big picture stuff coming down the pike starting on January 21st.
[03:40:54.389 --> 03:40:58.370]  Mr. Bloomberg mentioned H5N1. That I'm really worried about.
[03:40:58.530 --> 03:41:04.069]  It's all over wild birds on the western part of the United States and going up in the north.
[03:41:04.069 --> 03:41:05.409]  It's getting into the poultry.
[03:41:05.590 --> 03:41:08.049]  We're seeing sporadic human cases.
[03:41:08.209 --> 03:41:11.170]  No human-to-human transmission yet, but that could happen.
[03:41:11.170 --> 03:41:11.989]  It's in the cattle.
[03:41:12.110 --> 03:41:12.750]  It's in the milk.
[03:41:13.049 --> 03:41:14.149]  And that's just the beginning.
[03:41:14.329 --> 03:41:18.030]  We have another major coronavirus likely brewing in Asia.
[03:41:18.110 --> 03:41:27.750]  We've had SARS in 2002, SARS-2, COVID-19 in 2019. And we know these viruses are jumping from bats to people thousands of times a year.
[03:41:28.079 --> 03:41:29.520]  But there's still more.
[03:41:29.719 --> 03:41:37.180]  We know that we have a big problem with mosquito-transmitted viruses all along the Gulf Coast, where I am here in Texas.
[03:41:37.180 --> 03:41:43.000]  We're expecting dengue and possibly Zika virus coming back, or Apuche virus.
[03:41:43.319 --> 03:41:44.620]  Maybe even yellow fever.
[03:41:44.819 --> 03:41:45.680]  And there's more.
[03:41:45.840 --> 03:41:54.899]  Then we have all this sharp rise in vaccine-preventable diseases going up because of, in part, the anti-vaccine activism that's so prominent right now.
[03:41:54.899 --> 03:42:01.079]  We have a five-fold rise in pertussis cases, whooping cough over the last year, 15 measles outbreaks this year.
[03:42:01.200 --> 03:42:04.420]  We've got polio that's been in the wastewater in New York State.
[03:42:04.760 --> 03:42:09.680]  All that's going to come crashing down on January 21st on the Trump administration.
[03:42:09.860 --> 03:42:13.180]  We need a really, really good team to be able to handle this.
[03:42:13.309 --> 03:42:22.829]  Vaccine driven viral evolution or the common term leaky vaccine.
[03:42:22.829 --> 03:42:24.709]  That's the most important point.
[03:42:25.459 --> 03:42:29.340]  More important than the fact that the globalists admitted they'd use these viruses to take full control.
[03:42:29.780 --> 03:42:45.399]  Even more important than them being caught in all these previous lies and being total frauds in their own documents coming out, not just here, but around the world, health agencies coordinating to hype, fear, lie to the public, not treat people sick from other viruses so they die to add to those death numbers.
[03:42:45.799 --> 03:42:46.799]  That's all key.
[03:42:47.120 --> 03:42:58.049]  But most important is the fact that you give people During the big virus season, during winter, a bunch of experimental shots.
[03:42:58.409 --> 03:43:08.409]  It is on record that it causes not just the virus they're targeting, but many other coronaviruses, flu viruses, you name it, to be put under pressure in the body.
[03:43:08.670 --> 03:43:18.829]  And then that causes these dangerous mutations, which they're telling us is about to happen and make it jump into humans even easier.
[03:43:19.090 --> 03:43:20.790]  So why would you then have...
[03:43:21.450 --> 03:43:37.329]  10 companies in the US, dozens around the world, so many I can't even count them all, all coming out with their own bird flu shots, but having no idea what it's about to mutate into unless they already have it on the shelf at these bioweapon labs like EcoHealth Alliance and others,
[03:43:37.549 --> 03:43:43.190]  so that when the new variant shows up, don't worry, they've already got the so-called vaccine on the shelf.
[03:43:44.010 --> 03:43:47.870]  This is really important information.
[03:43:48.409 --> 03:43:54.549]  We've got scientists, doctors, researchers coming on today and throughout the week on my show.
[03:43:54.729 --> 03:43:58.170]  Follow us at RealAlexJones as we break this down.
[03:43:58.309 --> 03:44:02.829]  But it's really important to attack the credibility of these people and to point out the science.
[03:44:03.379 --> 03:44:07.200]  Science is about asking questions, not about Fauci saying, I am the science.
[03:44:07.420 --> 03:44:08.620]  Don't ask questions.
[03:44:08.840 --> 03:44:17.440]  This is a globalist eugenics death cult led by Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab that wants to depopulate the earth and wants full control over our bodies.
[03:44:17.620 --> 03:44:25.979]  This is an existential threat to everyone, and these criminals must go down before they release the next manufactured virus.
[03:44:26.180 --> 03:44:29.840]  What should be happening in the Biden administration right now that isn't going on?
[03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:33.850]  Yeah, there are two main things that they should be doing in the days that they have left.
[03:44:34.030 --> 03:44:36.129]  The first is to get testing out there.
[03:44:36.350 --> 03:44:42.329]  I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that just because we aren't testing, it doesn't mean that the virus isn't there.
[03:44:42.510 --> 03:44:44.049]  It just means that we aren't looking for it.
[03:44:44.170 --> 03:44:57.049]  We should be having rapid tests, home tests available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not.
[03:44:57.329 --> 03:45:02.530]  And the second very important thing is this is not like the beginning of COVID where we were dealing with a new virus.
[03:45:02.690 --> 03:45:03.569]  We didn't have a vaccine.
[03:45:03.750 --> 03:45:13.670]  There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1. The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses of the vaccine.
[03:45:13.909 --> 03:45:17.590]  However, they have not asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine.
[03:45:17.770 --> 03:45:19.010]  There's research done on it.
[03:45:19.129 --> 03:45:25.270]  They could get this authorized now and also get the vaccine out and to farm workers and to vulnerable people.
[03:45:25.680 --> 03:45:30.420]  I think that's the right approach because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu.
[03:45:30.620 --> 03:45:35.620]  If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization?
[03:45:36.000 --> 03:45:41.020]  If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing?
[03:45:41.340 --> 03:45:43.020]  I mean, that's a possibility.
[03:45:43.420 --> 03:45:51.799]  To me, the spring and the summer where we had all of the dairy cattle to farm worker exposure, we didn't have human flu circulating.
[03:45:52.059 --> 03:45:57.719]  So now we're entering a much more dangerous period, yet we're still not testing.
[03:45:57.879 --> 03:46:05.940]  And we should be providing tests free of charge to dairy farm workers so they can test anonymously weekly because they'll want to know.
[03:46:06.540 --> 03:46:12.819]  If they have both cases of potential flus co-circulating in their own body to protect their families.
[03:46:12.979 --> 03:46:13.879]  People are very smart.
[03:46:14.040 --> 03:46:16.500]  I find the American public to be incredibly smart.
[03:46:16.500 --> 03:46:23.440]  If you tell them the risk and you give them the tools, they will utilize them to protect themselves and their family.
[03:46:23.959 --> 03:46:31.360]  We told you that the globalists were going to launch a new plandemic, a new psychological warfare operation, a new hysteria.
[03:46:32.370 --> 03:46:35.270]  President Trump needs to get out ahead of this right now.
[03:46:35.670 --> 03:46:37.670]  He needs to expose these frauds.
[03:46:37.750 --> 03:46:40.549]  It is meant to kill the economy again.
[03:46:40.809 --> 03:46:47.649]  It is meant to take control of not just America's political policies, but the world's.
[03:46:47.950 --> 03:46:49.209]  This is the big move.
[03:46:49.370 --> 03:46:50.889]  Do you want the mask back on the kids?
[03:46:51.069 --> 03:46:52.190]  Do you want the lockdowns?
[03:46:52.250 --> 03:46:59.049]  Do you want them to have all these COVID centers around the world, not just filled with people they claim failed a PCR test, but political dissidents.
[03:46:59.309 --> 03:47:00.090]  That's the plan.
[03:47:01.609 --> 03:47:10.290]  Schmidt, the head of Alphabet, of Google, has come out and said he wants NATO and the UN to censor and arrest people during the next pandemic.
[03:47:10.510 --> 03:47:12.069]  He said that a few months ago at Stanford.
[03:47:12.290 --> 03:47:13.549]  They are gearing up.
[03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:14.950]  They are making their move.
[03:47:15.129 --> 03:47:16.610]  This is the big assault.
[03:47:16.930 --> 03:47:22.889]  This is their plan to derail the great awakening and continue their great reset.
[03:47:23.149 --> 03:47:26.350]  President Trump must come out and speak out against this.
[03:47:26.639 --> 03:47:33.600]  Now, but regardless of what he does, we have to come out and speak out about it right now and expose these criminals.
[03:47:33.819 --> 03:47:39.700]  Remember the horses running over people in Australia, Germany, Canada, who were out protesting the lockdowns.
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:41.299]  Remember all the tyranny.
[03:47:41.500 --> 03:47:44.219]  Remember the children cheering when they finally took the mask off.
[03:47:44.399 --> 03:47:50.040]  Remember the third world collapsing and tens of millions starving to death, not from the virus, but from the lockdowns from the virus.
[03:47:50.360 --> 03:47:54.879]  This is global government trying to take over our lives with the fear of a virus.
[03:47:55.579 --> 03:47:58.659]  Then their response are these poison shots that destroy our immune systems.
[03:47:58.899 --> 03:48:01.260]  This is globalist tyranny.
[03:48:01.420 --> 03:48:03.620]  This is phase two of their genocide.
[03:48:03.620 --> 03:48:09.520]  And we the people in the information war with the truth must rally with the facts and stop them now.
[03:48:09.700 --> 03:48:11.260]  It's us or them.
[03:48:11.829 --> 03:48:14.329]  Should there be a federal mask mandate?
[03:48:14.670 --> 03:48:25.610]  Yeah, at this point, there absolutely should be that mandate because we know that if all of us wear masks, we reduce the chance of transmitting or acquiring COVID-19 by five times.
[03:48:25.930 --> 03:48:28.590]  There is a real danger when we politicize science.
[03:48:28.590 --> 03:48:34.889]  That public trust is broken when we are politicizing science instead of following a scientific process.
[03:48:35.190 --> 03:48:36.909]  My kids are not eligible to be vaccinated.
[03:48:36.909 --> 03:48:38.590]  It's not that I don't want them to be vaccinated.
[03:48:38.590 --> 03:48:39.690]  It's that they can't be.
[03:48:39.989 --> 03:48:41.809]  And I do really worry.
[03:48:41.909 --> 03:48:44.290]  I have an almost four-year-old and a one-year-old.
[03:48:44.290 --> 03:48:47.290]  I cannot wait until they're eligible to receive the vaccine.
[03:48:47.569 --> 03:48:55.250]  I think until then, mask wearing for kids, especially if we are living in high transmission areas, is still going to be important.
[03:48:55.420 --> 03:48:59.500]  And what we really need to do at this point is to make vaccination the easy choice.
[03:48:59.700 --> 03:49:02.860]  It needs to be hard for people to remain unvaccinated.
[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:11.899]  I mean, we wouldn't imagine bringing together 20, 30 unvaccinated adults, putting them in a single room together the entire day and have them not wear masks.
[03:49:12.059 --> 03:49:14.840]  Why would we say that that's okay for our children?
[03:49:15.139 --> 03:49:24.219]  Travel and having the right to travel interstate It's not a constitutional right, as far as I know, to board a plane.
[03:49:24.600 --> 03:49:28.500]  And so saying that if you want to stay unvaccinated, that's your choice.
[03:49:28.500 --> 03:49:30.760]  But if you want to travel, you better go get that vaccine.
[03:49:30.920 --> 03:49:36.520]  I agree that masks are a very powerful layer of protection, but it's one layer.
[03:49:36.520 --> 03:49:41.780]  And if we have so many other layers that are present, masking may be one that could go away.
[03:49:41.780 --> 03:49:43.659]  But we are nowhere near that yet.
[03:49:43.659 --> 03:49:48.059]  And I think what we really need to do is get the vaccines authorized for children as soon as that's possible.
[03:49:48.630 --> 03:49:53.670]  There is no evidence whatsoever for any other vaccine causing long-term consequences.
[03:49:53.989 --> 03:50:01.129]  We really should be a lot more worried about the virus and the short-term as well as long-term consequences on our children as opposed to the vaccine.
[03:50:01.309 --> 03:50:06.750]  Make sure that you're wearing a mask even though it's outdoors if there are lots of people packed around you.
[03:50:06.909 --> 03:50:09.870]  Wearing a three-ply surgical mask, don't wear a cloth mask.
[03:50:09.989 --> 03:50:12.129]  Cloth masks are little more than facial decorations.
[03:50:12.569 --> 03:50:16.649]  There actually is a harm that we should be discussing of children continuing to mask.
[03:50:16.770 --> 03:50:22.729]  We should also be intellectually honest and say that masking has had a cost, especially for the youngest learners.
[03:50:22.909 --> 03:50:25.010]  So the risk-benefit calculation has really changed.
[03:50:25.250 --> 03:50:27.049]  I'm the mom of two little kids under five.
[03:50:27.209 --> 03:50:28.969]  I can't wait until they are vaccinated.
[03:50:29.290 --> 03:50:33.989]  But I would wait until we find that the vaccines are safe and effective.
[03:50:34.170 --> 03:50:38.569]  And I'm not sure that we can say that at the moment because we just don't have the data.
[03:50:38.850 --> 03:50:44.590]  But I also think that other parents would want to wait until we know that three doses will produce the intended effect.
[03:50:44.770 --> 03:50:56.290]  I'm not saying, I don't think anyone really is saying that no one should ever wear masks, but rather that the responsibility should shift from a government mandate imposed from the state or the local district of the school.
[03:50:56.590 --> 03:51:00.270]  Rather, it should shift to an individual responsibility by the family.
[03:51:00.579 --> 03:51:04.540]  The Oscar winners give a press conference and how to buy a sale there.
[03:51:04.639 --> 03:51:13.520]  I guess my feeling at this point in time is maybe we need to be completely a little bit more scary for the public.
[03:51:13.739 --> 03:51:18.500]  Especially with the Delta variant, which is the hardiest and most contagious variant we've seen to date.
[03:51:18.700 --> 03:51:21.000]  We need all the protection that we can get.
[03:51:21.159 --> 03:51:22.799]  That's why the vaccines are so effective.
[03:51:23.100 --> 03:51:26.319]  This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[03:51:26.770 --> 03:51:30.729]  We've got to get them vaccinated and hopefully they will do it willingly.
[03:51:31.149 --> 03:51:36.750]  I think we really need to make it clear that there are privileges associated with being an American.
[03:51:37.010 --> 03:51:37.989]  We have to be more hot.
[03:51:38.090 --> 03:51:39.350]  We have to be more forest folk.
[03:51:39.590 --> 03:51:43.610]  If you do not want to get vaccinated, you can work from home.
[03:51:43.610 --> 03:51:45.590]  You can homeschool your children.
[03:51:45.590 --> 03:51:47.010]  You can shop online.
[03:51:47.270 --> 03:51:48.950]  So where is this coming from?
[03:51:49.049 --> 03:51:52.049]  People saying, I'm now being forced to be vaccinated.
[03:51:52.209 --> 03:51:54.229]  If you want to travel, you better go get that vaccine.
[03:51:54.430 --> 03:51:59.010]  You should be wearing masks even when you are vaccinated if you are indoors.
[03:51:59.409 --> 03:52:03.090]  If you wish to have these privileges, you need to get vaccinated.
[03:52:03.290 --> 03:52:04.850]  We have to say something coming out.
[03:52:05.129 --> 03:52:06.430]  You know, you don't get vaccinated.
[03:52:06.829 --> 03:52:07.690]  You know you're going to die.
[03:52:07.850 --> 03:52:11.069]  I mean, let's just be really blunt of these people.
[03:52:11.930 --> 03:52:12.649]  Get vaccinated.
[03:52:14.770 --> 03:52:14.770]  It's on here.
[03:52:26.760 --> 03:52:32.860]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:52:32.940 --> 03:52:34.799]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:52:36.260 --> 03:52:37.340]  It's time to take action.
[03:52:37.680 --> 03:52:43.520]  So for a lot of you out there, this is free and you can make supplemental money very easily.
[03:52:44.000 --> 03:52:46.979]  I mean, I would imagine most people can make hundreds of bucks a month with their eyes closed.
[03:52:47.200 --> 03:52:52.899]  And if you really kick ass, thousands of dollars, even if you have a tiny, you know, X account or Facebook or whatever.
[03:52:53.219 --> 03:53:01.600]  But if you're a talk show host, I mean, you can make a living and finance your show and maybe even, you know, hire reporters or whatever.
[03:53:01.739 --> 03:53:03.020]  I mean, this is exciting.
[03:53:06.350 --> 03:53:10.430]  And one other thing, there are five limited edition fundraiser posters.
[03:53:10.610 --> 03:53:12.370]  And by fundraiser, everything raises funds there.
[03:53:12.430 --> 03:53:16.069]  But the t-shirts cost like 16, 17 bucks a piece before you buy them.
[03:53:16.170 --> 03:53:18.750]  And then the sponsor gets half and we get half.
[03:53:18.870 --> 03:53:23.170]  And to run all this and build a new network as a backup, you know, we're squeaking by.
[03:53:23.389 --> 03:53:30.229]  But when something says fundraiser on it, like a t-shirt that's cost double or a poster, yeah, the poster costs five, six bucks.
[03:53:30.549 --> 03:53:33.969]  I mean, the shipping, we ship it in the special packaging costs as much as the poster itself.
[03:53:34.579 --> 03:53:38.260]  So we're, you know, six, seven, eight, nine bucks for the poster cost with the packaging.
[03:53:38.459 --> 03:53:40.440]  And then we're selling it for 25, 30 bucks.
[03:53:40.579 --> 03:53:42.360]  That's because there's some real markup in there to fund it.
[03:53:42.440 --> 03:53:43.780]  So you know you're buying something.
[03:53:43.959 --> 03:53:46.139]  It's a memento that you really back what we're doing.
[03:53:46.719 --> 03:53:49.940]  The campaign coins, challenge coins, they're all there.
[03:53:51.219 --> 03:53:54.399]  So the posters run from $19.95 to $29.95.
[03:53:54.860 --> 03:53:57.479]  And we'll have new limited edition posters after that.
[03:53:58.020 --> 03:54:03.299]  But the posters on January 6th will be no more.
[03:54:04.180 --> 03:54:09.559]  They're limited edition, so if you get your order in by then, you will get the poster because they're print on demand there in Arkansas.
[03:54:10.120 --> 03:54:12.340]  If you want one of these posters, there they are.
[03:54:12.840 --> 03:54:16.760]  And again, you've got until January 6th to get your order in.
[03:54:16.899 --> 03:54:18.100]  They look great hanging on the wall.
[03:54:18.159 --> 03:54:22.790]  We got them hanging here in the And I designed all of these.
[03:54:22.969 --> 03:54:28.250]  My favorite is the Trump graph that I showed the day before the election that predicted the election.
[03:54:28.389 --> 03:54:30.430]  I said, she's going to try to steal it, but it's going to fail.
[03:54:30.670 --> 03:54:35.670]  So the blue line goes up and goes straight up, but it's not enough fraud to overpower the landslide.
[03:54:35.809 --> 03:54:37.850]  And that's actually the graph that actually happened.
[03:54:38.209 --> 03:54:39.309]  The key battlegrounds.
[03:54:39.469 --> 03:54:41.250]  So you talk about nailing it, baby.
[03:54:41.549 --> 03:54:42.469]  That's my favorite.
[03:54:42.590 --> 03:54:43.389]  I designed that one.
[03:54:43.549 --> 03:54:45.690]  And then the 47th one I designed as well.
[03:54:45.829 --> 03:54:46.950]  So I designed those.
[03:54:47.620 --> 03:54:49.879]  I did not design the Darkest Hour one, but there it is.
[03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:50.659]  Thank you for the support.
[03:54:50.780 --> 03:54:51.360]  I'm done plugging.
[03:54:51.799 --> 03:54:59.379]  I've just been looking at all the attacks and our victories in court, and I realized how much money it takes to take these people on, and they are so pissed we're still on air.
[03:55:00.079 --> 03:55:02.120]  And I have hired high-powered lawyers.
[03:55:02.219 --> 03:55:02.920]  That's why we're winning.
[03:55:04.040 --> 03:55:07.459]  And they tell me that we're going to really continue to have victory.
[03:55:07.939 --> 03:55:13.360]  Uh, but my lawyers, uh, are working seven days a week.
[03:55:13.520 --> 03:55:15.540]  And it's, I mean, cause I go and meet with them almost every day.
[03:55:15.680 --> 03:55:17.579]  I mean, and they call me at midnight and say, come to the office.
[03:55:17.700 --> 03:55:19.340]  I want you to read this and sign it, make sure it's accurate.
[03:55:19.379 --> 03:55:28.120]  I mean, we are, if I told you all the suits we filed on them and all the crap we're doing to these, to bloom, you know, to the whole deep state, because I can't be on defense anymore.
[03:55:28.159 --> 03:55:28.879]  I got to go on offense.
[03:55:29.579 --> 03:55:30.959]  It would take an hour to go over it all.
[03:55:31.540 --> 03:55:33.299]  Uh, but you want me to fight?
[03:55:33.479 --> 03:55:33.920]  I'm fighting.
[03:55:34.739 --> 03:55:44.969]  So, You're financing the current operation, you're financing the back-up Alice Jones network if we get shut down, and that's still getting built and expanded, not, you know, a larger studio, almost done.
[03:55:46.090 --> 03:55:48.069]  And you're financing the legal defense and offense.
[03:55:48.329 --> 03:55:49.229]  I mean, this is a war.
[03:55:49.350 --> 03:55:50.430]  You want somebody to fight for you?
[03:55:50.889 --> 03:55:51.829]  I love it.
[03:55:52.409 --> 03:55:55.209]  I mean, I'm begging for you to keep me in the game, keep me in the fight, Coach.
[03:55:55.370 --> 03:55:56.809]  But I'm here, you're serving.
[03:55:57.110 --> 03:55:58.170]  You commission me.
[03:55:59.170 --> 03:56:05.129]  Look, I won't stop regardless of what happens, but I'm asking you to empower me, and I will give you everything I got.
[03:56:05.469 --> 03:56:11.829]  I'm so focused right now and so sick of this crap and the stuff they've been doing to my family behind the scenes, just absolutely criminal.
[03:56:12.389 --> 03:56:15.149]  And so all I'm asking for is the support to keep fighting.
[03:56:15.760 --> 03:56:17.299]  And we make it easy with incredible products, okay?
[03:56:17.399 --> 03:56:17.860]  I'm done.
