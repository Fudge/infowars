[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.399]  It's Thursday, November 21st, 2024.
[00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.780]  We have massive World War III news we're about to exclusively break.
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.079]  Tell everyone you know, tune in now.
[00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.240]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:39.840]  We are 59 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, 3 seconds.
[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.960]  To the inauguration of the 47th President, Donald John Trump.
[00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:45.240]  I'm your host.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.340]  It is Thursday, November 21st, 2024.
[00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:49.679]  Alex Jones here.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.920]  Alright, I'm going to break two major, exclusive, massive stories right now that are...
[00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.329]  World-changing important.
[00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:09.670]  As you know, I have a lot of contacts in the Defense Department and in U.S. intelligence agencies.
[00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.730]  Some you see on air, some you don't.
[00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.909]  And I have a lot of sources at Mar-a-Lago.
[00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:16.349]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:26.569]  And I can tell you that Roger Stone is on his way there right now to triple confirm the information I'm about to tell you.
[00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.439]  President Trump and Elon Musk have been quiet since three days ago.
[00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:53.079]  The United States, under the evil bastards' orders, the puppet Biden began bombing Russian military targets deep inside Russia with attack-em army missiles that can be retrofitted, or not even retrofitted.
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.379]  Their main mission is nuclear sneak attack, but they use conventional weapons.
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:04.480]  The Russians have said, hey, Years ago, you move those up to the border, you ever fire those in conventional, we don't know there's not nukes on them.
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.419]  We may have to respond to the nuclear attack, especially if we see a whole bunch of them coming in.
[00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.699]  That would be the sneak attack.
[00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.919]  We've got to have total release of our weapons.
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.680]  We don't want to do it, but they've shown the simulations of the world being destroyed.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.439]  And US TV's shown that too, but when Russia shows it, national news here, and General Flynn's coming on next hour to talk about it, says, oh my God, Russia's preparing to nuke us.
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.840]  Look, they're doing simulations of hitting us.
[00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:32.520]  Well, I've seen hundreds of nuclear simulations of nuclear war in my lifetime.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.360]  Probably a thousand, actually.
[00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:37.039]  I've seen hundreds in the last couple years.
[00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:38.479]  We play them all the time.
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.719]  The Chinese have aired them.
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.919]  The Israelis have aired them.
[00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.879]  The Europeans have aired them.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.020]  The U.S. has aired them.
[00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:46.879]  Canada has aired them.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.020]  I mean, we've probably aired 10 of them from Western media in the last week.
[00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.120]  Well, Russia aired one last night, and the headlines are, Russia, look, is preparing to launch nukes.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.460]  No, they're showing what nuclear war will look like.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.580]  That's called a major deterrent.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.080]  But what's the big news?
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:17.310]  Elon Musk and Trump, Trump and Elon Musk, are behind the scenes, and this has come out A week ago, once he was president-elect, a week and a half ago, almost two weeks ago now, I guess it is two weeks,
[00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:25.990]  the first thing Trump did was call Zelensky with Elon, who knows him as well, and said, look, buddy, we can build your country back.
[00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.669]  Things can be great.
[00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.449]  This needs to stop.
[00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.210]  I know there were old bosses there in NATO telling you to do this.
[00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.849]  That's on record.
[00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.810]  Zelensky, two and a half years ago, wanted the peace deal with Russia just to not join NATO. This would all stop.
[00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.770]  And that was Putin's red line, and he didn't bluff.
[00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.509]  And Zelensky said, yeah, let's do it.
[00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.449]  And then Boris Johnson out of the U.K. and Biden out of the U.S. got on the phone.
[00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.409]  This all came out in the news.
[00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.990]  They didn't deny it.
[00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.009]  He said, nope, the war continues.
[00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.189]  You'll fight to the last Ukrainian.
[00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:56.930]  Low estimates are 600-plus thousand dead.
[00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:57.949]  High estimates are over a million.
[00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.349]  So this has escalated out of control.
[00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:10.270]  And then on Tuesday, the attack started dropping.
[00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:13.349]  Yesterday, the storm shadows started dropping UK weapons.
[00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:15.870]  Germany's refused to fire their similar weapons.
[00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.220]  The Chinese are reportedly running around cutting undersea cables.
[00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:20.579]  The Baltic Sea, it's all out of control.
[00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.120]  And we're saying, where's Trump?
[00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:28.300]  Well, I'll tell you, the more when we come back, he's behind the scenes trying to get a major announcement on peace.
[00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:29.560]  Stay with us, we'll break it all down.
[00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:33.040]  It is Thursday, November 21st, 2024.
[00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.850]  I am your embattled host, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.889]  Thank you for joining us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.629]  We are 59 days out from President Trump being inaugurated the 47th President of the United States of America.
[00:04:48.410 --> 00:05:06.639]  And the globalist military-industrial complex is hell-bent on launching a new world war that inexorably leads to thermal nuclear annihilation, fiery Armageddon, and On Tuesday,
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:15.139]  I aired many times a video of Trump a year ago saying we need a peace deal in Ukraine.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.980]  That once he was president, he would stop the war.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.620]  That it was leading to nuclear war.
[00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.100]  And I explained, this is old.
[00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.639]  We expect to see Trump come out and say something new.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.860]  But everybody wanted to hear from Trump's show.
[00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:29.540]  Just our post, three posts of it.
[00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.790]  Last time I checked, they all had over 40 million views.
[00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:34.110]  So that shows people are interested.
[00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.490]  That's 120 million views.
[00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:43.410]  That is, when we went and looked at the date, that's from last year.
[00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:46.949]  Now, you've not heard anything from Trump.
[00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:48.949]  And yesterday I said, this is a big problem.
[00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.170]  It had been two days since the United States, under orders of Biden, which he announced on Sunday, which started on Tuesday...
[00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:11.170]  Really still Monday here, but Tuesday in Russia, 3.30 in the morning, started raining ATACUM U.S. Army missiles down inside Russia, blowing up Russian missile bases.
[00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.689]  Russia didn't really say anything.
[00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:16.430]  They were waiting to see if more came.
[00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:27.310]  And then the U.K., as you know, yesterday began launching, now the numbers are over 20, storm shadow missiles that are similar to the ATACUM's into Russia.
[00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.430]  Russia.
[00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:47.329]  Now, I began to make phone calls yesterday afternoon, and this morning, talking to multiple sources, they said,
[00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.170]  yeah, Alex, you already know the answer to this.
[00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:51.069]  What do you think Trump's doing?
[00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:52.310]  He's always about peace.
[00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:53.310]  He loves peace deals.
[00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:04.800]  He likes having civilization and not having his grandkids die, and What was Trump and Musk doing a week and a half ago, right after the election, two weeks ago?
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:10.339]  They were calling Zelensky, saying, stop, have a ceasefire.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.680]  Don't escalate this.
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.560]  We'll rebuild your country.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.480]  And reportedly talks with Putin.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.540]  Well, obviously, Alex, that's ongoing.
[00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:24.980]  So, I'm like, well, is that what's happening?
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.540]  Yeah.
[00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:34.290]  And that I made some more calls and was told that is what they have been told very close to the president.
[00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:41.610]  And Roger Stone is on his way to Mar-a-Lago right now to talk to the president.
[00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:45.810]  And if it's not off-record or if he can tell us anything, he will.
[00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.250]  I'm sure certain people will get the off-record information.
[00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.610]  I'm not sure who that might be.
[00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.509]  Maybe someone close to me like me.
[00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:55.110]  But...
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.439]  That is going on.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:17.779]  So rest assured, President Trump is working on a ceasefire to begin with, and then talks and commitments for both sides to stand down until Trump gets in in 59 days,
[00:08:17.819 --> 00:08:19.360]  and there'll be a major peace summit.
[00:08:20.229 --> 00:08:37.370]  The problem is, and I know you don't need me to tell you this, but for new listeners and leftists that think that there are no X and Y chromosomes and things like that, two men can have a baby, and that inflation's good, and open borders are good, and that Biden's sharpest attack.
[00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:43.769]  The military-industrial complex, the big banking interests, and they've been leaked UN documents, you name it.
[00:08:44.409 --> 00:08:46.149]  They want a global war.
[00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:47.590]  It'll hurt the rest of the economy.
[00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:48.509]  It'll kill a bunch of people.
[00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:53.470]  It runs a serious danger of nuclear war and ending civilization and life on the surface of the planet as we know it.
[00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.850]  But they only think about their own interest.
[00:08:56.789 --> 00:09:00.149]  And you notice now they're saying, oh, the stock market's starting to weaken.
[00:09:00.409 --> 00:09:02.149]  The Trump euphoria is wearing off.
[00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.049]  No, it's not the Trump stock euphoria wearing off.
[00:09:07.289 --> 00:09:22.450]  It is global war and the potential that Trump will be handed a out-of-control major kinetic conventional war that all of the different war games, if it continues on,
[00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.590]  lead to nuclear war.
[00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:30.769]  And in almost every war game, we're talking 99%, you get any nuclear war, you get full nuclear war.
[00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.429]  And the war games...
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:48.799]  60-plus percent of the time, supercomputers, Russia, China, the U.S., private corporations, and I've got my own supercomputer, it's called my brain, it concurs, show that a war would start in Ukraine.
[00:09:48.799 --> 00:09:49.980]  That's been going on for a decade.
[00:09:50.379 --> 00:09:56.039]  The other one says it will start between India and Pakistan next, North Korea.
[00:09:58.159 --> 00:10:01.519]  So those are your hotspots, Ukraine and Eastern Europe.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:11.100]  And the Baltic states, India and Pakistan and or India and China going to war.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:19.159]  And then you've got North Korea and South Korea and China.
[00:10:20.179 --> 00:10:23.200]  And then you can also have Israel if they get hit by a nuke by Iran.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.259]  And you know Iran has nuclear weapons, by the way.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.500]  Been telling you that for 20 years.
[00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.289]  Saudi Arabia's got them too.
[00:10:34.629 --> 00:10:36.990]  That's the fourth area that could kick off.
[00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:42.649]  So, this is where we are.
[00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.830]  So, this is completely out of control.
[00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:57.269]  So, I'm not going to make you wait hours and give you the big news later.
[00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.610]  I'm going to flesh it out, go through it.
[00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:00.470]  But, yeah.
[00:11:01.649 --> 00:11:05.470]  The answer was, well, of course, that's what Trump's doing.
[00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:06.610]  What do you think he's going to do?
[00:11:07.049 --> 00:11:07.250]  Yeah.
[00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:12.350]  It's ongoing, been going on before these attacks started on Tuesday.
[00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:20.889]  And Trump understands that the deep state would try to do this and hand him a full war or maybe blow up the planet and give us a legacy of ashes.
[00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.889]  So that is going on.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:31.139]  The other big news is what's really going on with this purported intercontinental ballistic missile.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.480]  The ballistic missile again goes up into space and comes back down.
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:42.940]  A cruise missile flies either low or high but in the atmosphere.
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.159]  Nuclear bombs are dropped out of aircraft.
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.639]  You can fire nuclear weapons out of artillery.
[00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:52.500]  You can hand-deliver them.
[00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:57.539]  They've got two-man teams, more modern versions of the Davy Crockett.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:08.480]  You've got torpedo-delivered nuclear weapons, space-based nuclear weapons that you don't get told about are there and admitted to have been paid for.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:23.850]  You've got a lot of other exotic weapons, sabot, meteor guns, X-ray lasers, cyclotronic particle beams, and a lot more.
[00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.789]  Smart pebbles, the list goes on and on.
[00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:28.809]  And that's just what I know about.
[00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:40.169]  So, there's also all these ultrasonic aircraft you see everywhere that are not aliens.
[00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.490]  And the globalists want to go ahead and have this world war.
[00:12:46.629 --> 00:13:04.250]  Even though it'll wipe out most of civilization, they've got their super deep underground bases because China and Russia and others are now getting up to the point where the US was 30 years ago and have also developed the free energy technologies and anti-grav and all those systems.
[00:13:05.309 --> 00:13:08.850]  And so the globalists don't want other countries to get that because they want the world government.
[00:13:09.149 --> 00:13:12.350]  They want the world government, they believe, for the stability of the planet in the future.
[00:13:12.549 --> 00:13:28.669]  But to do that, they've got to depopulate most of the Earth, create, basically, museums where you have groups of primitive-type agrarian people, high-tech city-states that the globalists live in, Elysium-type facilities,
[00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:29.389]  but on the Earth.
[00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:36.919]  And the Earth then basically is turned into a national park for the new off-world civilization.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:47.000]  And I told you this decades ago, Jeff Bezos two years ago came out and said the Earth will be a nature preserve and everybody will be depopulated.
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:53.360]  I mean, that's their Reich, their Hitlerian thousand-year...
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.620]  A megalomaniac plan.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.500]  Obviously, it's not going to work.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.980]  People are going to find out about it.
[00:14:00.059 --> 00:14:01.240]  People don't want to be depopulated.
[00:14:01.539 --> 00:14:04.080]  When they cut the food off, it'll cause mass unrest and war.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.720]  The Russians aren't going to roll over.
[00:14:07.919 --> 00:14:08.840]  Others aren't going to roll over.
[00:14:08.899 --> 00:14:15.659]  Once the plan's out, no matter how science fiction-esque and nightmarish it is, when people see the plan unfolding right in front of them, they're going to listen to me.
[00:14:18.139 --> 00:14:18.879]  And they are.
[00:14:19.539 --> 00:14:20.519]  They're listening to others.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.820]  And Musk is saying everything I'm saying.
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.759]  So Musk wants all this to be public and everybody to have access to it.
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.159]  There's unlimited space.
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:33.659]  And the globalists want to be sneaky and bad and evil and don't want you to have it.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.299]  So yeah, Musk is a transhumanist to a certain extent.
[00:14:38.039 --> 00:14:39.120]  He's a libertarian.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.320]  He just wants it to be public.
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.200]  You can make the decision whether you want to be a cyborg or whatever.
[00:14:45.059 --> 00:14:50.720]  And he says this course to cut off resources will trigger a global confrontation and kill everybody.
[00:14:51.019 --> 00:14:53.759]  So he's just sensible transhumanist.
[00:14:55.299 --> 00:14:57.279]  And very open about it.
[00:14:57.419 --> 00:14:58.379]  I respect that.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.679]  The New World Order globalist psychos are not...
[00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:05.850]  And they're going to get us all killed.
[00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.070]  So there's the big picture.
[00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:14.710]  So I'll get back into Trump behind the scenes with Musk trying to broker a ceasefire until Trump gets in and then a major peace deal.
[00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:28.230]  But first, let me get into the ICBM. Now, there's a debate whether it's a classic intercontinental ballistic missile or whether it's an intermediate-range ballistic missile.
[00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.330]  That really doesn't matter.
[00:15:29.409 --> 00:15:31.610]  A ballistic missile goes up.
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.779]  Into space and then comes down.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:40.860]  So it has a arc like one half of the McDonald's arches.
[00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:48.440]  It goes up and then it comes out of space at 30,000 miles an hour and it's very hard to shoot down.
[00:15:50.059 --> 00:16:06.299]  Now Russia responded overnight in Ukraine by hitting a major factory munitions depot And when you see the ballistic missile, whether it's intermediate range or long range,
[00:16:06.419 --> 00:16:13.240]  it doesn't matter, it's a ballistic missile, that goes up into space in Russian territory, and then comes back down to Ukrainian territory.
[00:16:17.139 --> 00:16:26.379]  And again, the thing about a ballistic missile is, it's just as easy to shoot it straight up and have it hit 100 miles away as it is to have it hit 10,000 miles away, because once you get into space...
[00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:35.389]  There's no drag on the aeronautics of the warhead package.
[00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:45.529]  And so in just a few minutes, it's launched out of Russia and it comes down on New York or Chicago or Austin, Texas or Los Angeles.
[00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:54.750]  So that's why they're such a good weapon is that they get there fast, they got big payloads.
[00:16:54.830 --> 00:17:13.549]  So When you look at what's coming into the atmosphere and coming down to that low cloud cover and destroying that weapons complex, what you're seeing is MIRV technology.
[00:17:14.269 --> 00:17:15.670]  And that's important.
[00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:21.930]  That's multiple reentry vehicles.
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.460]  That can have a conventional warhead of high explosives.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.759]  They can have a chemical warhead.
[00:17:32.859 --> 00:17:45.819]  But their design and their main mission is carrying a hydrogen bomb or an atomic bomb or a neutron bomb or some of the other nasties they've got that I'm not going to talk about on air.
[00:17:48.319 --> 00:17:48.940]  So...
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.559]  Yeah, well...
[00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:52.000]  So...
[00:17:54.259 --> 00:18:24.430]  That was a demonstration of precision ballistic missile with conventional payloads to illustrate that Russia can launch a nuclear attack anywhere they want in the world at any time And drop the warheads down to
[00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.069]  a few square feet of where they want.
[00:18:28.529 --> 00:18:38.809]  And that NATO's anti-missile defense systems and anti-ballistic missile defense systems didn't stop one warhead.
[00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:46.869]  Now let me explain how MIRV technology around since the 60s, perfected by the 80s, that Bill Clinton gave to China in the 90s.
[00:18:47.109 --> 00:18:48.650]  Russia wouldn't even give it to them.
[00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.349]  They've had it since the 70s.
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.000]  You fire a ballistic missile.
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:59.460]  You can have a small payload, a big payload, depending on the size of the rocket.
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:10.660]  If they wanted to weaponize the Falcon Heavy, they're going to have 400 launches in the next couple of years of those, by the way.
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.259]  You could put...
[00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.849]  A hundred large hydrogen bombs in the nose cone of that baby.
[00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:19.009]  Easily.
[00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:21.430]  Hell, they're so miniaturized now, maybe 500.
[00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:23.589]  All right?
[00:19:25.349 --> 00:19:27.529]  Each one would blow up Dallas, Texas.
[00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.809]  Everything flattened.
[00:19:30.309 --> 00:19:31.809]  So, did you hear what I just said?
[00:19:32.009 --> 00:19:35.190]  You could put on the biggest ballistic missile in the world...
[00:19:36.779 --> 00:19:40.500]  Hundreds of hydrogen bombs that would blow up hundreds of Dallas, Texas.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.460]  Hundreds of Chicago, Illinois.
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.680]  Hundreds of New York, New Yorks.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:56.680]  Now, the missiles, the different sizes the Russians have, generally would carry the smaller ones between 5 and 10, the larger's up to 20 to 40, depending on the size of the bombs.
[00:19:57.539 --> 00:20:08.759]  Now, it goes up And then it maneuvers to where it wants to come down in its trajectory and telemetry.
[00:20:11.119 --> 00:20:38.609]  And then when it comes back into the atmosphere, the nose cone splits off and opens and then rockets on the back of smaller delivery devices or MIRVs blast off and accelerate To hypersonic speeds of up to 30,000 miles an hour.
[00:20:43.049 --> 00:20:51.309]  And if they had hydrogen bombs on them, they would have detonated at about 2,000 feet, not at point-blank range.
[00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:59.349]  So you would see, if it was a hydrogen bomb, you would have seen there giant hydrogen bomb explosives.
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.779]  When you see a lot of the nuclear testing, they would do it on the ground, you see the...
[00:21:03.779 --> 00:21:05.039]  And then a mushroom cloud.
[00:21:05.119 --> 00:21:07.160]  No, when they go in the atmosphere, it's...
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.019]  Airburst.
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:29.420]  And then it destroys everything on the ground, and it's a friendly thing to do because, and I'm serious, because even if it's a clean hydrogen bomb, if you detonate it on the ground, any metals that are part of the nuclear explosion during the chain reaction...
[00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.589]  We'll create super radioactive isotopes.
[00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:40.809]  I mean, God forbid you shoot a hydrogen bomb at a factory full of cobalt.
[00:21:41.289 --> 00:21:48.750]  If a small hydrogen bomb detonated a factory full of cobalt, the entire surface of the earth would be unlivable for billions of years.
[00:21:49.990 --> 00:22:00.279]  Alright, well, when it goes into steel or aluminum or silver or gold or all those different metals, copper, it just throws out It's the equivalent of giant nuclear reactors melting down, okay?
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:05.319]  So that's one reason you do airburst is you want to make that area livable later.
[00:22:06.579 --> 00:22:10.480]  And you don't want to breathe the radiation downstream in your own country when it gets in the atmosphere.
[00:22:14.359 --> 00:22:23.019]  So, the Russians just simulated a massive nuclear attack on Ukraine.
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.440]  And again, you want to spread the bombs out.
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:35.039]  It's not just that you detonated 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 feet, depending on the size of the weapon.
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:56.880]  You also can have it come back into near-earth atmosphere, and then you can have one MIRV package fire those rockets out over 1,000 or more miles and hit a whole bunch of targets.
[00:22:57.019 --> 00:22:58.680]  They just hit that military...
[00:23:00.159 --> 00:23:01.039]  Factory complex.
[00:23:02.019 --> 00:23:03.680]  And laid them right into.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.940]  Reportedly it hit dead on.
[00:23:06.059 --> 00:23:07.440]  Right in the top of all those factories.
[00:23:08.059 --> 00:23:09.859]  Each one went right into the roof.
[00:23:10.019 --> 00:23:10.779]  Right where they wanted it.
[00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:11.900]  To say you see that?
[00:23:12.079 --> 00:23:14.680]  We can shoot this up your ass from Russia.
[00:23:15.079 --> 00:23:16.779]  We can shoot this down your chimney.
[00:23:19.119 --> 00:23:20.460]  And we just demonstrated.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.819]  We just blew up this giant factory complex.
[00:23:24.259 --> 00:23:24.700]  Now.
[00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:32.970]  You've got Bolton and McCaffrey and all these globalist stooges that couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag.
[00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:42.670]  All over TV, you've got the idiot Austin, Secretary of Defense, all over TV saying, I played some of it yesterday, but I saw more last night.
[00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.809]  Oh, they don't have any technology.
[00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.349]  They don't have any weapons.
[00:23:46.509 --> 00:23:47.690]  Their nukes don't work.
[00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:51.849]  What type of ridiculous horse crap is that?
[00:23:52.089 --> 00:23:54.869]  These are the people that couldn't stop Donald Trump getting into office.
[00:23:55.569 --> 00:23:59.250]  These are the inheritors of the people that couldn't beat the Vietnamese.
[00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:03.910]  Yeah, they got control of the government.
[00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:05.029]  They're a bunch of crooks.
[00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:07.630]  But they're not all powerful.
[00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:09.369]  And they're losing power.
[00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:11.430]  And they're trying to hold the world nuclear hostage.
[00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:13.150]  And now they're saying, oh, don't worry.
[00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.970]  Russia's nukes are old and don't work.
[00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:18.269]  Horse crap.
[00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:19.930]  I've read all the doctrine.
[00:24:20.089 --> 00:24:21.589]  I've read the Pentagon public reports.
[00:24:21.849 --> 00:24:30.289]  I've talked to the weapons experts, and they tell me that the United States has a limited arsenal of supersonic superweapons that are badass.
[00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.190]  But most of our systems are rotting.
[00:24:34.309 --> 00:24:36.470]  And it's the same thing with the Russians.
[00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.549]  But if the Russians have got...
[00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:43.789]  40,000 nuclear weapons and 30 plus thousand delivery systems.
[00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.130]  And I'm being very conservative there.
[00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.829]  Let's say 10% of them work, which way more than that are going to work.
[00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:50.349]  Anybody knows about this stuff?
[00:24:50.529 --> 00:24:54.809]  You think a bunch of plastic explosive jacketed in a hydrogen bomb made 30 years ago?
[00:24:56.009 --> 00:24:59.849]  Anybody knows about explosives and hardwired electronics?
[00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:02.769]  All they got to do is put new batteries in that thing.
[00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.170]  Hey folks, do explosives get more powerful or less powerful over time?
[00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.190]  I'm talking about the conventional explosives.
[00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:14.529]  That detonate the uranium or plutonium or fire the uranium into the plutonium.
[00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.390]  No, it has almost no effect how old they are.
[00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.410]  That's bull crap.
[00:25:21.609 --> 00:25:23.930]  It affects how fast the missiles are.
[00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:35.190]  Well, it doesn't matter when one goes up into space and then comes back down on your ass because it's already got the gravity of Earth and it's coming in at 20, 30,000 miles an hour.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.960]  And you think Bolton even knows all this?
[00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:42.299]  No, he had to walk around and act cool with that stupid mustache.
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.000]  You think Austin, Lloyd Austin, knows anything?
[00:25:48.119 --> 00:25:49.380]  Look at his background.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.619]  He's a front man.
[00:25:50.779 --> 00:25:51.799]  He's a dumbass.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.880]  So the American people beat the globalists and got Trump in.
[00:25:58.559 --> 00:25:59.819]  Are they all powerful?
[00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:02.539]  The answer is no, they aren't.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:16.240]  So, Russia just simulated successfully a nuclear weapon attack on Ukraine with precision.
[00:26:16.299 --> 00:26:18.220]  And here's the big takeaway.
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.079]  It didn't get stopped.
[00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:27.700]  You notice you don't even see attempts.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.380]  You don't even see other explosions up in the atmosphere trying to stop it.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:31.579]  No.
[00:26:32.609 --> 00:26:35.009]  No, because that's what these things do.
[00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:40.509]  Probably going, they got systems, might have been going 35,000 miles an hour.
[00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:42.410]  You gonna stop that?
[00:26:43.349 --> 00:26:45.470]  Yeah, there's some limited lasers that can do it.
[00:26:45.869 --> 00:26:50.470]  But you don't think the Russians are jacketing these in laser resistant material?
[00:26:51.859 --> 00:26:52.440]  We'll be right back.
[00:26:52.539 --> 00:26:52.960]  Stay with us.
[00:26:53.319 --> 00:27:00.220]  I respectfully ask you to pay attention to what I'm about to say because it is critical in three important ways.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.839]  It'll keep my broadcast on the air.
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:15.519]  It will get you the highest quality, amazing CBD that's so good for your whole body, inflammation, joints, You name it, and you're getting the best deal you're going to find anywhere.
[00:27:15.819 --> 00:27:18.740]  I've been promoting and selling CBD for more than 20 years.
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:23.180]  Everybody knows how amazing it is, but not all CBD is equal.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:36.599]  This is a high quality, made in Texas, very strong CBD, thousand milligram tincture that has been put in nanoparticles, so it's eight to nine times stronger than regular CBD that already gives you great effects.
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:47.160]  On top of that, we private label it from a top company that sells it to a bunch of other companies that sell it from between $140 to $90 to $76.
[00:27:47.819 --> 00:27:54.039]  This is the lowest price you're going to find on CBD of this quality anywhere in the market.
[00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.029]  The industry just massively marks it up.
[00:27:57.369 --> 00:28:05.309]  There's still some good margin in here for our sponsor to support their operation and support us, and then that savings is passed on to you.
[00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:12.130]  So if you want to get great CBD and keep the broadcast on air, visit jonescbd.com.
[00:28:14.869 --> 00:28:16.670]  Let me tell you the names of these products.
[00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:19.769]  Ultra Green, because it's amazing.
[00:28:20.009 --> 00:28:21.089]  And Dreamwave.
[00:28:21.349 --> 00:28:24.470]  You want to get both of these, and it supports the broadcast.
[00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:34.190]  You will not be disappointed, particularly if you're already into CBD, and you take this that costs a third or half of what you're paying, and you get a great response.
[00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.470]  I know you're going to love it.
[00:28:35.609 --> 00:28:39.950]  That's what I'm looking for is repeat customers for our sponsor, jonescbd.com.
[00:28:40.109 --> 00:28:41.069]  Thanks for your support.
[00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:46.069]  This is the best deal out there, and it funds the fight against tyranny, a total 360 win.
[00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:49.650]  Visit jonescbd.com today, and I think of your support.
[00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:54.369]  All right, just minutes ago, Putin just released a world address.
[00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:56.849]  I'm getting the transcript right now.
[00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:03.390]  We've translated it from Russia, and I'll be breaking that news here in a moment.
[00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:07.569]  But Putin just said what I just said.
[00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:10.589]  We beat him by about 25 minutes.
[00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:18.549]  He said the ICBM attack was a nuclear demonstration that they can hit Ukraine with nuclear weapons and that NATO can't stop the missiles.
[00:29:19.089 --> 00:29:19.710]  So, see?
[00:29:21.329 --> 00:29:22.829]  I know what I'm talking about.
[00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:26.089]  I broke that exclusively and I didn't get that from sources.
[00:29:26.089 --> 00:29:27.789]  I understand the weapons and what just happened.
[00:29:28.349 --> 00:29:32.349]  So, we're going to get an English translation of that for you.
[00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:36.170]  Right now.
[00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:37.309]  All right.
[00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.029]  We do have an English translation of it right now.
[00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:45.930]  Let's go ahead and roll that.
[00:29:46.410 --> 00:30:01.490]  The Russian citizens and our friends around the world, as well as those who still nurture illusions that a strategic defeat can be inflicted against Russia, about events that are happening in the Special Military Operation Zone.
[00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:14.089]  I'm talking about What happened in the wake of long-range Western weapons being used in the Special Military Operations Zone.
[00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:26.000]  As a result of the escalation The United States and their NATO allies said that they give their permission to use long-range weapons against targets inside Russia.
[00:30:27.579 --> 00:30:41.740]  Experts know fully well, and the Russian side has underscored this time and again, that using such weapons without the direct involvement of military operators from manufacturing countries is impossible.
[00:30:42.539 --> 00:30:58.140]  On November the 19th, Six attackers, missiles manufactured in the US, were used, and on the 21st, a combined attack using Storm Shadow, manufactured in the UK,
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:07.960]  and missiles manufactured in the US, were used to attack missile targets in the Bryansk and Kursk regions of the Russian Federation.
[00:31:09.779 --> 00:31:19.839]  Starting from that point, as we have underscored many times, the regional conflict in Ukraine, provoked by the West, acquired a global character.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:26.400]  Our anti-missile systems countered those attacks.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:33.799]  As a result, the targets and objectives set by the enemy were not achieved.
[00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:43.450]  The fire and the ammunition storage in the Bransk region, as a result of fragments of attack on missiles falling, has been contained.
[00:31:43.829 --> 00:31:44.410]  No victims.
[00:31:44.869 --> 00:31:51.250]  In the Kursk region, one of the command and control centers of our separate group was attacked.
[00:31:52.910 --> 00:32:08.819]  As a result of the attack and the countermeasures, there have been people wounded and killed and Those who were involved in servicing these facilities,
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:24.400]  but those who were members of the command have not been hit by the attack and are now continuing their operation to remove the enemy from the Kursk region.
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:30.900]  I repeat, the use of such weapons cannot change the course of the special military operation.
[00:32:32.839 --> 00:32:42.680]  Our military is successfully advancing along the entire line of contact, and all the objectives that we set before ourselves will be met.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:58.519]  As a response to the use of US and UK manufactured weapons, the Russian forces, We have carried out a combined strike on one of the military-industrial facilities in Ukraine.
[00:33:00.519 --> 00:33:10.039]  And this included the test of a novel, intermediate-range Russian missile system.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:18.400]  A ballistic missile with a non-nuclear hypersonic payload was used.
[00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:22.609]  The test was carried out successfully.
[00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:25.730]  The objectives of the launch have been met.
[00:33:28.329 --> 00:33:45.880]  One of the largest and well-known industrial centers that is known since the Soviet times In the Nipah region, which is known to be involved in enemy production,
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:46.799]  was hit.
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:56.380]  And further, plans are being made in Europe and the Asia-Pacific to deploy weapons and missiles.
[00:33:56.839 --> 00:34:10.460]  And we believe it is a mistake on the part of the United States to destroy the system that was established by the And missile treaty in 2019.
[00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:27.860]  We see that the United States and their allies are now considering and has successfully attested their capabilities to deploy advanced missile systems in different parts of the world.
[00:34:28.039 --> 00:34:33.440]  And their exercises routinely include the use of such weapons.
[00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:49.340]  Russia has unilaterally I refuse to deploy intermediate and small range of missiles until we see similar weapons deployed by the United States in a region of the world.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:58.920]  The use of the novel system, which was essentially an operational test, was carried out in response.
[00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:03.010]  To the decisions made by the United States and their allies.
[00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:10.690]  And the further actions will be considered and decided based on what we see from them.
[00:35:11.869 --> 00:35:18.030]  The further course of action will be determined based on the threats to the security of the Russian Federation.
[00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:30.030]  We believe that we have the right to use our weapons against military facilities of countries who allow Their weapons to be used against ours.
[00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:38.090]  And in case of an escalation, we will act as decisively in a mirror fashion.
[00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:48.650]  The ruling elites of the countries are nurturing plans to use their military contingents against Russia should be warned.
[00:35:51.150 --> 00:36:19.030]  When choosing our measures to be used in response, Such as the use of systems that were tested recently in Ukraine will certainly include warnings to civilians and to clear the zones that will be targeted and we will certainly do this and In a transparent fashion.
[00:36:19.849 --> 00:36:38.110]  And we do not have any fears that it will reduce the effectiveness of those systems because there is no way to counteract a missile that flies it at 10 Mach, which is 2.5 to 3 omtons per second.
[00:36:38.929 --> 00:36:48.320]  Existing anti-missile systems And the anti-missile systems deployed by the United States and Europe cannot intercept such missiles.
[00:36:50.719 --> 00:36:51.880]  It is impossible.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:37:00.340]  So, once again, it is not Russia but the United States who have destroyed the system of international security.
[00:37:01.019 --> 00:37:06.340]  And they are trying to preserve their hegemony and stoking a global conflict.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:15.030]  We have always preferred, and we still prefer, to resolve More disagreements and using peaceful means.
[00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.730]  But we are prepared for any scenario.
[00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:21.769]  And if anyone has any doubts, they shouldn't.
[00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.889]  There will always be a response.
[00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:30.110]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:33.630]  Just so listeners understand, this is all I do.
[00:37:34.949 --> 00:37:39.650]  That broke 12 minutes ago.
[00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:44.610]  I wrote the headlines for the show 10 minutes before we went live.
[00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:50.750]  And for the Alex Jones Network feed, we have a bunch of feeds, but we'll put it on screen.
[00:37:51.409 --> 00:37:52.369]  What did I say?
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.199]  Global exclusive.
[00:37:55.579 --> 00:38:07.840]  Russia's successful ICBM attack on Ukraine weapons factory was a clear demonstration that Putin's nuclear force delivery systems can defeat NATO's anti-dash missile systems.
[00:38:08.199 --> 00:38:13.000]  Must watch, share, live edition of the Alex Jones show.
[00:38:14.559 --> 00:38:16.760]  And he word for word...
[00:38:18.139 --> 00:38:24.719]  Just said what I said because that is a fact if you know the weapons and the countries and the doctrines.
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:30.039]  And I understand to liberals that tune in, this all sounds like somebody trying to sound like a professor or something.
[00:38:30.199 --> 00:38:32.079]  And, oh, this guy's really funny, man.
[00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:33.320]  He can really make up some stuff.
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:36.719]  He really sounds like he knows what he's talking about, but he's full of crap.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.280]  You're the people that teach.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:45.280]  And Bill Nye, the science guy, they took down his old movie shows for kids from 30 years ago, 20 years ago.
[00:38:45.599 --> 00:38:48.460]  They've re-released them saying there are no X and Y chromosomes.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.000]  So you're the people that, again, say two men can have a baby.
[00:38:52.179 --> 00:38:53.039]  You're in the cult.
[00:38:54.369 --> 00:38:57.349]  I'm not, and I'm sorry I'm informed, and I'm sorry you're not.
[00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:01.050]  The left's everywhere saying they don't want atrazine out of the water.
[00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:02.329]  I have videos and articles.
[00:39:02.909 --> 00:39:03.809]  Kennedy's crazy.
[00:39:03.929 --> 00:39:05.170]  Who cares if atrazines in the water?
[00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:13.210]  The allowable amount in almost all of our water supply bends gender, gives you cancer, destroys fertility, turns the frogs gay, literally.
[00:39:13.329 --> 00:39:15.670]  They try to have sex with males, and their populations plummet.
[00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:26.320]  The left are all over TV drinking seed oils that are machine lubricant, Because they're mad that Trump might at least put warnings on them.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.260]  You are in a damn cult.
[00:39:28.659 --> 00:39:30.280]  You want to drink atrazine.
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.559]  You want to eat seed oils.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.480]  You don't know what ICBMs are.
[00:39:33.579 --> 00:39:34.780]  You don't know what MIRVs are.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:38.559]  You don't know what nuclear demonstrations of force are.
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.480]  You don't know anything.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.340]  You're in a cult.
[00:39:42.739 --> 00:39:44.219]  I wish you'd listen.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.639]  I wish you were smart.
[00:39:46.559 --> 00:39:47.500]  But you're not.
[00:39:47.679 --> 00:39:48.219]  You're stupid.
[00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:55.070]  So that said, let's go to the real Alex Jones headline that I wrote 10 minutes before the show.
[00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:59.210]  What did I tell you there that has not broken yet?
[00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:02.409]  And if Trump doesn't get a successful deal, it will never break.
[00:40:02.849 --> 00:40:08.630]  But it answers the question, where is Trump for three days since our country started bombing Russia?
[00:40:09.909 --> 00:40:13.329]  And now I feel good because he is on it.
[00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:15.210]  Global exclusive.
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:37.619]  Now, I know the listeners that routinely listen know that I'm pretty informed on a lot of subjects.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.239]  But we have millions of new viewers a day that are tuning in to see what it's all about.
[00:40:41.679 --> 00:40:43.940]  This is why the DOJ is trying to close us.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.840]  This is why they don't like us.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:49.039]  Because I just don't want my family to die in a nuclear war.
[00:40:49.699 --> 00:40:50.679]  And I'm informed.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.300]  And I've done this for 30 years.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.340]  And all I do is interview top experts.
[00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:57.019]  Former top UN weapons inspectors.
[00:40:57.199 --> 00:40:58.639]  Former top UN prosecutors.
[00:40:59.019 --> 00:41:00.280]  Former top US generals.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.619]  Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:41:02.179 --> 00:41:03.539]  Former heads of the Air Force.
[00:41:04.119 --> 00:41:11.829]  Former top CIA. And I also do all my own research, and quite frankly, in general areas, most people are specialists.
[00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:13.769]  I am a generalist in all of this.
[00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:17.809]  I collectively have more knowledge than any of these people I've ever talked to.
[00:41:18.789 --> 00:41:25.929]  And they always think at dinner or on the phone or in person that I'm a freak because I know all this stuff.
[00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:31.010]  I don't know how anyone wouldn't want to know about nuclear weapons, their delivery systems, and threat postures.
[00:41:32.219 --> 00:41:34.099]  And known arsenals versus secret arsenals.
[00:41:34.199 --> 00:41:40.980]  I don't know how anyone would want to interview, before he died more than ten times, the head of the Star Wars program, Dr.
[00:41:41.099 --> 00:41:41.539]  Bob Bowman.
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:46.940]  I don't know why anyone wouldn't want to interview the current head at the time of the Hart Project he came on.
[00:41:47.059 --> 00:42:01.360]  I don't know why anyone wouldn't want to get the deathbed confession of E. Howard Hunt that ran the assassination operation of JFK. I don't know why anyone wouldn't want to interview LBJ's admitted mistress before she died about how LBJ bragged about killing Kennedy before and after.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.519]  I've interviewed thousands and thousands and thousands of people.
[00:42:06.739 --> 00:42:13.920]  He would never come on, but for a decade, I talked to Anthony Sutton all the time, the former Senate head archivist, who saw all the secret documents.
[00:42:14.699 --> 00:42:15.699]  That's what I do.
[00:42:16.719 --> 00:42:22.320]  I interviewed the woman who leaked all the documents on Skull and Bones because her father was in it, Charlotte Isby, probably a hundred times.
[00:42:22.579 --> 00:42:24.380]  This is what I do.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.619]  I was the first person to ever infiltrate Bohemian Grove successfully.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.059]  This is what I do.
[00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:34.710]  So I just showed you exactly what Russia did.
[00:42:34.909 --> 00:42:37.070]  No one else anywhere was saying it.
[00:42:37.289 --> 00:42:44.369]  And then 15 minutes after I break it, they release, we got the timestamp, the Vladimir Putin video.
[00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:48.050]  So this is not about me up here, oh look, I'm right again.
[00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:52.809]  I'm telling you known facts by people that are informed.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:43:07.219]  So when Lloyd Austin and all the rest of the globalist scum and neocons like John Bolton are all over television yesterday and today saying, don't worry, Russia can't wipe their ass.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.280]  Russia doesn't have any nuclear weapons that work.
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.619]  That is horse manure.
[00:43:15.139 --> 00:43:21.900]  Russia is on record and the United States has got stuff better.
[00:43:23.889 --> 00:43:28.510]  But that's a ruse that we don't have better hypersonic missiles than they do.
[00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:30.150]  Does it matter?
[00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:36.829]  Does it matter if a missile hits you going 30,000 miles an hour or 25,000 miles an hour?
[00:43:39.389 --> 00:43:43.849]  Does it matter if a missile's going 3,000 feet per second or 2,000 feet per second?
[00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:45.849]  It doesn't matter at those speeds.
[00:43:46.909 --> 00:43:52.730]  It doesn't matter if Russians drop 300 megaton bombs on us and we drop 400 megaton bombs on them.
[00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:54.090]  It doesn't matter.
[00:43:54.929 --> 00:44:02.909]  It's like saying, does it matter if you get fed into a giant industrial wood chipper or just an industrial wood chipper?
[00:44:04.989 --> 00:44:10.610]  Does it matter if you get hit by an 18-wheeler dead-on at 100 miles an hour or 80 miles an hour?
[00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:12.730]  It makes no difference.
[00:44:16.159 --> 00:44:19.659]  Does it matter if you get shot with a 12-gauge 100 times or 50 times?
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:41.619]  So, I'm going to tell you again, and no one's denying this now, and now there's headlines about World War III's already begun today.
[00:44:42.659 --> 00:44:44.039]  I forgot to tell Curry to print those up.
[00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:48.309]  Headlines like, has the New World War already begun?
[00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:56.030]  Oh, you see, they're easing you in, sleepwalking you in to Armageddon.
[00:44:57.130 --> 00:45:01.449]  So I don't get up here and say all this to sound smart or sound dramatic.
[00:45:02.429 --> 00:45:04.050]  I know this information.
[00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:07.469]  The people at the Pentagon know this information.
[00:45:16.789 --> 00:45:17.329]  Yep.
[00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:19.110]  The Hill today.
[00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:21.329]  Print that up for me.
[00:45:21.769 --> 00:45:23.010]  World War III is here.
[00:45:23.269 --> 00:45:24.510]  World War III is now.
[00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:31.530]  But I say yesterday, I said within 48 hours, you will hear that World War III has begun.
[00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:37.170]  People equate the term World War III with nuclear war.
[00:45:37.329 --> 00:45:37.530]  No.
[00:45:37.889 --> 00:45:40.050]  In the first phase, you see what's happening now.
[00:45:45.849 --> 00:45:47.750]  Germany preparing for Third World War.
[00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:51.849]  It's already begun, my friends.
[00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:59.449]  So, what are we going to do about it?
[00:46:02.789 --> 00:46:09.429]  It's not World War III. It's about to begin, but World War Z has begun.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:21.460]  London Independent Joe Biden is granting Ukraine permission to use NATO-supplied rockets to attack military targets within Russia is an escalation of European conflict, now passes its thousandth day.
[00:46:21.699 --> 00:46:27.179]  And though it is far from being a global conflict, the West is effectively now at war with Putin's forces.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.019]  Say, Mark, almond.
[00:46:35.019 --> 00:46:36.199]  Uh, yeah.
[00:46:36.199 --> 00:46:36.679]  Yeah.
[00:46:38.679 --> 00:46:47.099]  Putin said two months ago and a month ago and a week ago, he said, if you hit us with these missiles or even greenlight them publicly, we are officially at war with you.
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:47:12.349]  And now the Russians have just demonstrated that they can fire a ballistic missile tipped with whatever payload they want and that it will evade the anti-missile systems of NATO and the armed camp And war laboratory of the globalists that is Ukraine.
[00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:33.630]  So, why don't you have Rob do go into the first hour yesterday and get where I said within the next 48 hours you'll hear that we're in World War III. And then just take a clip from a few minutes ago where I show the articles.
[00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:41.909]  See, this has all been war-gamed thousands of times that I know of, probably a lot more, by the U.S. government alone.
[00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:54.090]  So I've read hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of the declassified boil-downs of these scenarios and the different counter-scenarios.
[00:47:55.969 --> 00:48:00.090]  So, I know this backwards and forwards, and anybody that studies it would.
[00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:02.969]  I know it's not cool like a football game.
[00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:04.510]  I don't know anything about football.
[00:48:04.809 --> 00:48:05.909]  I mean, I used to.
[00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:09.269]  Decades, I won't pay attention to it.
[00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:26.309]  I mean, to be nice with my parents, a month ago, out at their farm, I watched a UT game and ate chili my mom made and sat there and Researched World War III while they watched UT. It's cute.
[00:48:27.469 --> 00:48:28.690]  And I get it.
[00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:44.809]  But if people don't start caring about stopping nuclear war and stopping the collapse of Western civilization and stop the cutting off of fertilizer that grows the food and cutting off the energy that supplies the West,
[00:48:45.449 --> 00:48:55.380]  the globalists are openly announcing all over their banning farms, England, Netherlands, Ireland, Sri Lanka, and saying we're going to do this everywhere.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.420]  You're not going to run to the country.
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:12.920]  I mean, we have mad scientists, death cult, human extinctionists that are almost in control of us.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:15.880]  But now they've run into a brick wall.
[00:49:18.679 --> 00:49:20.039]  I am that brick wall.
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.840]  You are that brick wall.
[00:49:22.119 --> 00:49:23.679]  Elon Musk is that brick wall.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.340]  Donald Trump is that wall.
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.960]  Knowledge is that wall.
[00:49:29.579 --> 00:49:35.320]  Praying to God to be given direction and discernment is that brick wall.
[00:49:37.059 --> 00:49:58.699]  So if we care about reality, If we care about Russia saying, we just showed you that we can hit you with MIRV technology on a hypersonic missile and you saw the gleam in Putin's eye,
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:07.659]  you can bet NATO fired a bunch of stuff at that missile.
[00:50:12.519 --> 00:50:15.260]  You can bet space-based stuff took a shot at it.
[00:50:16.199 --> 00:50:18.860]  You can bet ground-based stuff took a shot at it.
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:22.079]  You can bet air-based stuff took a shot at it.
[00:50:22.579 --> 00:50:23.920]  And they didn't stop it.
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:36.500]  You know, you see something like the first Star Wars that's cheesy, but it's really archetypal from 1970s Cold War knowledge.
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:38.739]  And Governor Tarkin...
[00:50:41.429 --> 00:50:46.670]  They've just gotten word from the Emperor that they've fully dissolved the Senate, and now the galaxy is truly under total tyranny.
[00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:50.090]  No local representation in the planetary systems.
[00:50:52.809 --> 00:50:57.789]  And he says to Princess Leia, while they're looking out the viewport at her home world, Alderaan...
[00:50:58.539 --> 00:51:02.880]  He says, if you don't tell me where the rebel base is, I'm going to blow up your home world.
[00:51:03.159 --> 00:51:04.599]  She goes, oh no, we're peaceful.
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:06.099]  We have no weapons.
[00:51:06.519 --> 00:51:12.139]  He says, then give me a military target to demonstrate this battle station.
[00:51:12.139 --> 00:51:15.519]  I'm going to give orders from the emperor, and I will destroy the rebel base.
[00:51:15.579 --> 00:51:18.059]  She says, they're on Dantooine.
[00:51:22.659 --> 00:51:23.659]  He says, thank you.
[00:51:24.099 --> 00:51:26.019]  You may fire when ready.
[00:51:26.139 --> 00:51:27.519]  And she says, no, you just...
[00:51:27.519 --> 00:51:33.519]  He said, that's too remote of a system to fully demonstrate the power of this battle station.
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:34.860]  Guys, pull that up.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.380]  Pull up The Destruction of Alderaan.
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:39.320]  It'll be on YouTube.
[00:51:40.039 --> 00:51:41.340]  Death Star Destroys Alderaan.
[00:51:41.659 --> 00:51:42.900]  Now, that's a movie.
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:48.139]  Well, Vladimir Putin...
[00:51:50.039 --> 00:52:01.880]  Just demonstrated the thermonuclear destruction of Ukraine with a missile, even a small one would hold five to ten warheads.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:20.230]  If that was spaced out geographically, with hydrogen bombs of even a medium size compared to the spectrum today, Basically, all of Ukraine would be a flattened, burning wreck.
[00:52:20.969 --> 00:52:21.730]  One missile.
[00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:23.610]  You're like, well, wait a minute.
[00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:25.670]  We saw it come in and a bunch of little missiles hit.
[00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:28.190]  Yeah, because they wanted to target just that area.
[00:52:28.449 --> 00:52:40.150]  If it came in and then at 100,000 feet fired, it could vaporize every major city in Ukraine.
[00:52:41.139 --> 00:52:42.360]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:43.559]  We can stop World War III together.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:44.760]  Please support us.
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.480]  Here's the facts in 60 seconds.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:53.619]  The Justice Department came into my bankruptcy, has tried to shut us down twice since May.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.440]  The latest case was last week.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.260]  The judge shut them down.
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:58.340]  They were thrown out of the building.
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:52:59.679]  Crimes were committed.
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:01.559]  It's very clear they're in a lot of trouble.
[00:53:01.739 --> 00:53:03.400]  I filed counter lawsuits.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:04.639]  You name it.
[00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:06.989]  Infowarsstore.com is in limbo.
[00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:08.769]  If you order there, you'll get your products.
[00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:23.050]  But thealexjonesstore.com is our great sponsors in Arkansas with t-shirts and great supplements that are funding not just Infowars, but the Alex Jones Network in case this gets shut down at another hearing next week.
[00:53:23.329 --> 00:53:27.030]  So, a lot of people aren't going to thealexjonesstore.com right now.
[00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:29.670]  We're getting messages, oh, we don't want to give money to The Onion.
[00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:35.949]  The Onion didn't get InfoWars, and they don't own Alex Jones, and they don't own the Alex Jones Network.
[00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:37.010]  I don't even own that.
[00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:37.809]  It's the sponsor.
[00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:51.219]  So again, when you go there and get great Trump gear, Alex Jones gear, Patriot gear, incredible supplements like Ultimate CMOS, Collectible posters, incredible designer knives, and more at thealexjonesstore.com.

[00:53:55.860 --> 00:54:00.539]  Over the weekend, folks, we saw our funds cut in half and people told us, well, we don't want to give it to The Onion.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.440]  The Onion does not own me.
[00:54:02.579 --> 00:54:05.760]  They do not own thealexjonesstore.com.

[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:36.079]  It's not owned by The Onion.
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.900]  It's not owned by The Easter Bunny.

[00:55:03.429 --> 00:55:04.210]  We're fighting hard.
[00:55:04.409 --> 00:55:05.230]  We're winning.
[00:55:05.449 --> 00:55:07.030]  But the fight is close.
[00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:12.449]  So we need your prayer, your word of mouth, and your support right now at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[00:55:45.769 --> 00:55:47.250]  We've entered the Alderaan system.
[00:55:48.389 --> 00:55:49.469]  Governor Tarkin!
[00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:52.510]  I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.
[00:55:52.829 --> 00:55:56.269]  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
[00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:59.630]  Charming to the last.
[00:56:00.329 --> 00:56:04.449]  You don't know how hard I found it, signing the order to terminate your life.
[00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:06.889]  I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:15.519]  Princess Lear, before your execution, I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.
[00:56:16.099 --> 00:56:18.840]  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:24.539]  The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
[00:56:24.719 --> 00:56:27.219]  Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.
[00:56:27.679 --> 00:56:32.760]  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that will be destroyed first.
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:43.219]  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power on your home planet of Alderaan.
[00:56:44.039 --> 00:56:44.599]  No.
[00:56:45.059 --> 00:56:46.039]  Alderaan is peaceful.
[00:56:46.119 --> 00:56:46.880]  We have no weapons.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:47.559]  You can't possibly...
[00:56:47.559 --> 00:56:50.940]  You will prefer another target, a military target, then name the system.
[00:56:53.539 --> 00:56:57.019]  I grow tired of asking this, so it'll be the last time.
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.539]  Where is the rebel base?
[00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:04.610]  Dantooine.
[00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:07.289]  You're on Dantooine.
[00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:10.230]  Well, you see, Lord Vader, she can be reasonable.
[00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:12.230]  Continue with the operation.
[00:57:12.409 --> 00:57:13.670]  You may fire when ready.
[00:57:13.949 --> 00:57:14.269]  What?
[00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:15.989]  You're far too trusty.
[00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:19.750]  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration, but don't worry.
[00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:22.550]  We will deal with your rebel friends soon enough.
[00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:23.610]  No!
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:58:01.639]  All right, Putin started speaking live at 1110 Central, and I announced in the first five minutes, and again at six after when we came back to join stations, that Putin did this as a demonstration of a hypersonic ballistic missile that could deliver nuclear weapons,
[00:58:01.739 --> 00:58:02.719]  and that NATO couldn't stop it.
[00:58:03.679 --> 00:58:07.599]  Again, I just demonstrate this stuff for you.
[00:58:09.239 --> 00:58:14.079]  And last night, I was driving back down here at 7 o'clock at night, but there was a traffic jam.
[00:58:14.599 --> 00:58:23.199]  And I was going to say this last night that I believed that Putin would do an ICBM simulated nuke strike.
[00:58:23.739 --> 00:58:25.239]  I've actually got the text messages here.
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:25.920]  I'll show you.
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:30.420]  That I was coming up here to do that.
[00:58:31.219 --> 00:58:33.420]  And there was a giant traffic jam.
[00:58:33.579 --> 00:58:34.579]  I was in traffic for 30 minutes.
[00:58:35.019 --> 00:58:36.519]  I hadn't moved anywhere.
[00:58:37.889 --> 00:58:38.530]  Three miles.
[00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:43.050]  And I came up to a spot where I could turn around on the road.
[00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:45.190]  I called dude and said, go to your family.
[00:58:45.429 --> 00:58:46.909]  He was going to stay up until 10 at night with me.
[00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:50.429]  And I said, I got a responsibility to come break this.
[00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:50.929]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:58:51.329 --> 00:58:53.670]  I still broke it 10 minutes before Putin.
[00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:56.070]  So...
[00:58:56.070 --> 00:58:58.329]  And I just remember 10 minutes before we went live.
[00:58:58.349 --> 00:58:59.289]  I said, oh yeah, that.
[00:59:00.329 --> 00:59:03.710]  Oh, that's the ICBM test, of course.
[00:59:03.869 --> 00:59:11.460]  I... I mean, I've just got to always go with the discernment and the knowledge.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:16.719]  And so now when I tell you that Trump and Elon are working for a ceasefire, that's an exclusive.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.820]  I'll talk more about it when we come back.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.219]  We've got some big guests coming up as well.
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:21.840]  Folks can pay attention.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:30.360]  And when I tell you we're very close to nuclear war, maybe people will listen to me a little bit.
[00:59:30.679 --> 00:59:36.170]  I mean, I know people are listening, but No broadcast does this.
[00:59:36.389 --> 00:59:40.230]  That's why they have congressional hearings about me and say we want that son of a bitch off the air.
[00:59:40.909 --> 00:59:47.469]  They've had defense department hearings on TV. We played the clip so many times saying we want Jones off the air.
[00:59:48.849 --> 00:59:51.710]  Because I have studied all of it.
[00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:58.570]  And it's very frustrating to be the only person with a big show that is this effective.
[00:59:58.829 --> 01:00:00.130]  We need to get everybody awake.
[01:00:01.409 --> 01:00:03.650]  Because it makes me a big target to be the only person.
[01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:14.829]  Alright, I am in a paradox right now because I'm basically probably more effective not even doing a radio show, TV show.
[01:00:16.769 --> 01:00:20.630]  Because I got a lot of phone calls coming in, a lot of sources and a lot of intel.
[01:00:21.809 --> 01:00:25.670]  And it's invaluable information, obviously.
[01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:27.989]  But I'm going to continue on here.
[01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:31.210]  But during the breaks, I'm working on some other big stuff we're about to break.
[01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:38.889]  Quite frankly, Matt Gaetz withdrawing his nomination in the last 30 minutes to be the Attorney General.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:44.380]  Behind the scenes, we expected that because it's become a distraction.
[01:00:44.619 --> 01:00:48.900]  Matt Gaetz just pulled his nomination.
[01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:53.889]  Trump was still defending him this morning, saying he shouldn't.
[01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:55.489]  I believe this is Matt Gaetz's decision.
[01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:56.030]  I don't know that.
[01:00:56.090 --> 01:00:56.929]  I'll find out very quickly.
[01:00:57.690 --> 01:01:00.570]  But he would have been a great attorney general.
[01:01:00.869 --> 01:01:02.130]  The deep states really messed with him hard.
[01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:05.929]  But they are going to turn this into a giant fiasco.
[01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:16.469]  And I'm saying go ahead with it, because, you know, Kavanaugh and all that crap they pulled there, they're doing it to RFK Jr., saying he, you know, approached a babysitter wrongfully.
[01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:17.630]  I mean, it's so simple.
[01:01:18.329 --> 01:01:19.369]  This has happened to me.
[01:01:21.439 --> 01:01:30.079]  Any woman that ever worked here got calls from the national media, the Daily Mail, you name it, on record, offering them $10,000, $20,000, $30,000.
[01:01:31.519 --> 01:01:35.480]  The offers went as high as $50,000 to say I did something to them sexually.
[01:01:36.699 --> 01:01:40.320]  And multiple women that worked here called and told me about it and told people, screw off.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.940]  Alex Jones was nothing but a pure gentleman.
[01:01:43.659 --> 01:01:53.079]  And they got one woman, and they paid her, this later came out, to say that I walked in the break room and said, I want to have a baby with you.
[01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:58.340]  Absolutely preposterous, never did that.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.320]  And it's just ridiculous.
[01:02:03.179 --> 01:02:05.119]  And let's just get down to facts here.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.599]  I'm a married man.
[01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:16.349]  And if I want to get women, I sure as hell am I going to sit here and get them out of the office.
[01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:19.530]  And I'm not bragging or anything, but I've never had any trouble with women.
[01:02:20.329 --> 01:02:26.530]  So, I'm not saying I'm Casanova or anything, but, you know, I'm here on a mission.
[01:02:26.989 --> 01:02:30.250]  I mean, do you think Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Mr.
[01:02:30.409 --> 01:02:35.309]  Movie Star looks, is coming on to his babysitter?
[01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:38.349]  All total horse crap.
[01:02:40.699 --> 01:02:43.119]  Absolute, total, complete bull.
[01:02:44.639 --> 01:02:48.860]  And I know they data mined Facebook starting when Trump got elected.
[01:02:50.659 --> 01:02:52.579]  And they would see me at parties and things.
[01:02:52.679 --> 01:02:59.039]  I didn't go to a lot of parties, but they would data mine with face scanning technology and scan the database of Facebook, one of the services you could pay them to do.
[01:02:59.239 --> 01:03:00.900]  It's not really advertised, but you can do it.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:10.030]  And they would then find out who women were through the database, call them, And then I got a lot of calls and emails and tracked down.
[01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:17.989]  These women would say, hey, remember at a party three years ago at X? Not at X, X2, I mean just X place?
[01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:19.110]  No.
[01:03:19.969 --> 01:03:24.369]  Well, let me email you this photo.
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:26.480]  I took a photo with you.
[01:03:26.659 --> 01:03:34.900]  I posted it on Facebook with me and my husband, and I just got offered $10,000 to talk about what you did to me, and I just met you once, but I wanted you to know this was happening.
[01:03:35.159 --> 01:03:36.960]  I'm like, great, give me the name of the Daily Mail reporter.
[01:03:37.139 --> 01:03:37.940]  Oh, how'd you know it's Daily Mail?
[01:03:38.019 --> 01:03:38.900]  Just give it to me.
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:39.780]  Sure.
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:44.460]  You call him up, you send the Daily Mail, and you say, man, I really don't want to have to sue you.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.340]  So what's going on?
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.920]  Well, we're just doing an investigation.
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:49.800]  So that happened a lot.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.880]  So, they're doing the same thing to Matt Gage.
[01:03:54.019 --> 01:03:59.940]  They're doing the same thing to RFK Jr.
[01:04:00.599 --> 01:04:01.920]  when I was getting divorced.
[01:04:03.179 --> 01:04:09.820]  Now, 11, 12 years ago, I did some dating for a while, and I was very impressed.
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:18.500]  They must have gotten my phone records or something, because I had quite a few women I dated contact me there.
[01:04:18.599 --> 01:04:22.300]  And these were women I had gone out with, that I had been with.
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:29.960]  And they said, yeah, I'm being offered money by this publication or this group or this organization, this group, to say bad things about you.
[01:04:30.079 --> 01:04:32.300]  And I just told them, you're a great guy.
[01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:36.070]  By the way, what are you doing?
[01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:41.610]  So, this is the stuff that goes on.
[01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:44.170]  I treat women super nice.
[01:04:44.489 --> 01:04:45.449]  So does Trump.
[01:04:45.949 --> 01:04:47.309]  Women love me.
[01:04:50.849 --> 01:04:52.849]  So, I mean, I know what's happening to Gates.
[01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:54.969]  I know what's happening to RFK Jr.
[01:04:54.969 --> 01:04:55.949]  It's bullcrap.
[01:04:56.849 --> 01:05:00.630]  And they interviewed a bunch of the women on Gates.
[01:05:01.799 --> 01:05:04.380]  You know, that are all like 35, 40 years old now.
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:07.400]  Because this goes back 12, 13, 40, 50 years.
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:07.699]  They're women.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.219]  They said, oh, that guy's so nice.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.320]  Oh, yeah, I did date him.
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:14.119]  Yeah, you know, I did have sex with him in a hotel room.
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:15.460]  We took, you know, ecstasy.
[01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:16.539]  It was me and two other girls.
[01:05:16.719 --> 01:05:17.199]  It was really fun.
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:19.199]  He's a great guy.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:25.639]  Oh my God, Matt Gaetz, when he was 25 years old, and they show the women on TV, they're like super gorgeous.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:27.900]  People are like, damn, Matt Gaetz is quite the stud.
[01:05:28.519 --> 01:05:30.719]  So, yeah, Matt Gaetz is human.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.159]  Okay, so now we know.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:36.599]  So, that's all we got, huh?
[01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:37.159]  That's it?
[01:05:37.699 --> 01:05:39.000]  We're really bad people.
[01:05:39.139 --> 01:05:39.719]  We like women.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.380]  So, sorry we don't like kids.
[01:05:44.409 --> 01:05:45.630]  Sorry we're not pedo.
[01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:52.789]  Sorry we're not having anal sex on top of the Senate conference hearing room.
[01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:59.230]  Sorry we're not stealing people's luggage while we also oversee the nuclear stockpile.
[01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:02.809]  Sorry we're not weird men with wigs on.
[01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:08.309]  Taught them on TV about how they want to chop your son's genitals off like Rachel Levine.
[01:06:10.159 --> 01:06:20.079]  Sorry we're not funding drag queen story time with convicted pedophiles showing up at public schools unannounced, not telling parents, with kids bouncing on men dressed up like clowns.
[01:06:20.179 --> 01:06:22.719]  And in some of the photos and videos, the men have erections.
[01:06:24.159 --> 01:06:28.320]  And the teacher comes and has the kid lay on them on the floor in a grooming...
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:35.239]  Yeah, that's all okay to put in public schools for elementary and middle school students books about pedophilia with graphic...
[01:06:36.449 --> 01:06:45.090]  Novels with real lifestyle graphics, lifelike cartoons of little boys being molested by men.
[01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:53.929]  Sorry, sorry I dated some women when I was getting divorced.
[01:06:54.349 --> 01:06:55.309]  Oh my gosh.
[01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:57.309]  Imagine that.
[01:06:58.030 --> 01:07:01.429]  So, that's where we are.
[01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:02.730]  That's what's going on.
[01:07:09.069 --> 01:07:11.909]  I want to go over all the military news, life developments.
[01:07:12.110 --> 01:07:14.170]  I wrote massive news in the first hour.
[01:07:14.289 --> 01:07:15.650]  I'm going to recap it, give you more details.
[01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:22.369]  But since we're talking about Matt Gaetz, let's look at what they were gearing up to do.
[01:07:22.969 --> 01:07:31.929]  And of course, they're going to do this to every male nominee that Trump nominates.
[01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:36.210]  Oh, they're not going to talk much about P. Diddy and all the Democrats in his connection to Epstein.
[01:07:36.289 --> 01:07:40.090]  They're not going to talk about Kamala Harris' husband and his connections.
[01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:40.389]  No, no.
[01:07:40.449 --> 01:07:47.849]  They're going to talk about Matt Gaetz 15 years ago with Party Girls.
[01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:52.929]  Gaetz withdraws from consideration for Attorney General.
[01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:59.449]  And we've got Trump's response to that, but Here's what was happening in the lead up to that.
[01:07:59.570 --> 01:08:05.510]  House ethics panel did not agree to release the Gates report yet.
[01:08:06.929 --> 01:08:10.349]  GOP warns Gates hearings will be Kavanaugh on steroids.
[01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:12.849]  Well, that turned the country against him.
[01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:14.949]  Doesn't work.
[01:08:16.869 --> 01:08:19.550]  Yahoo News, graphic sex assault claims...
[01:08:20.829 --> 01:08:28.750]  About Trump Secretary of Defense nominee Pete Hegseth detailed in bombshell police report.
[01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:35.810]  Mediaite obtains full police report on sexual assault allegation.
[01:08:37.050 --> 01:08:40.930]  Federal inquiry traced payments from Gates to women.
[01:08:43.109 --> 01:08:49.250]  Exclusive former babysitter to RFK Jr.'s kids speaks out about sexual assault allegation.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:09:09.300]  Cooney knew then she had to speak, so this summer she went public with her story about how Kennedy, a man going after Big Pharma, a man closer to her father's age really, groped her when she worked as a living nanny for his family.
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:12.560]  She was then 23 years old.
[01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:20.109]  I know there are hardworking people who don't have skeletons in their closet.
[01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:27.649]  Cooney said in an exclusive interview with USA Today, and I wish we were electing people with fewer skeletons in their closet.
[01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:32.649]  Then they go on to say he abandoned his presidential bid because of it.
[01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:35.369]  No, they wouldn't even let him on the ballot in most areas.
[01:09:37.779 --> 01:09:38.760]  It happened so quickly.
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:47.340]  Why it was 25 years ago, she claims, when she began working for Kennedy at his environmental law clinic during the week and weekends as family's babysitter.
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.720]  As part of the job, she moved to Kennedy's house in New York.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:55.760]  Kennedy had three kids who lived with him and two kids of a previous marriage who visited on weekends.
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:10:02.600]  She knew Kennedy men had reputations for being wealthy, good-looking, and forward with women.
[01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.539]  But she was still shocked.
[01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:08.989]  I'm surprised to me it happened so quickly, she said.
[01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:17.529]  One night there was a meeting in the family kitchen and Kennedy and another person were there to talk about work related to the wall cleaning.
[01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:21.090]  She said she felt Kennedy rubbing her leg under the table.
[01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:30.149]  Another time she said a shirtless Kennedy, oh my God, then 46 appeared in her bedroom doorway asking her to rub lotion on him.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:35.979]  She said the unenthusiastically obliged in order to get it over with.
[01:10:36.239 --> 01:10:46.020]  Later, she said he approached her from behind in the kitchen pantry and started groping her, sliding his hands from her hips to the sides of her breast.
[01:10:46.239 --> 01:10:49.659]  While doing so, he was blocking her exit from the small room.
[01:10:49.859 --> 01:10:51.119]  Then she went public.
[01:10:53.359 --> 01:11:00.150]  Years later, decades later, Yeah.
[01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:06.010]  It just goes on and on and on.
[01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:08.930]  The same crap.
[01:11:09.569 --> 01:11:12.390]  And of course the Kavanaugh women all got completely discredited.
[01:11:13.949 --> 01:11:22.270]  The woman that said Trump in an open stall doesn't even have doors where people try shoes on.
[01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:23.590]  She can't remember what year.
[01:11:23.949 --> 01:11:25.289]  Came up and grabbed her.
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:35.300]  And then he said he was innocent, so he's found liable twice by juries, not for raping or doing it, no, just for saying he was innocent.
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.319]  You know, can't say you're innocent.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.520]  Of course you can, whether you are or not.
[01:11:39.779 --> 01:11:55.229]  And then she said, I wore this dress when he assaulted me on the cupboard of Vogue, and then it turned out they made that dress Two years plus after she said he assaulted her,
[01:11:55.409 --> 01:11:56.329]  it didn't exist.
[01:11:56.770 --> 01:12:11.310]  Like if she said, I was in the back of the year of the car, and he jumped in the car and assaulted me, and then the car, she says, wasn't made and didn't exist until two years later.
[01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:13.350]  That's called discredited.
[01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:16.949]  Plus, the woman is a known insane loon ball.
[01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:23.550]  But, you know, I don't believe this stuff because it's been discredited almost every time.
[01:12:24.670 --> 01:12:31.210]  And the mainstream media, the corporate media, the dinosaur media, the legacy media only cares when it's a patriot going up against the evil system that they bring this up.
[01:12:32.069 --> 01:12:44.670]  And they cover up all the real stuff, even in the WikiLeaks, children, seven-year-olds being delivered to John Podesta to service him in the upstate New York farms hot tub for his entertainment.
[01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:51.930]  The children are well trained, but they are children, they said.
[01:12:55.529 --> 01:12:58.590]  So, that's where we are.
[01:12:58.689 --> 01:13:04.109]  But, you know, covering all of this, I've got Congresswomen flipping out with racist anti-white garbage.
[01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:05.909]  I mean, all that's interesting, all that's important.
[01:13:06.670 --> 01:13:12.909]  I've got England openly announcing they're going to basically take everybody's farms because they want to move illegal aliens into them.
[01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:15.250]  I mean, I've got a lot here.
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:28.119]  But at the end of the day, the big news is the war front, because that's definitely the globalist move.
[01:13:28.239 --> 01:13:33.619]  They may pull some other stuff, false flags, civil war crap, but right now they're going with the World War III scenario.
[01:13:34.659 --> 01:13:36.520]  So we'll get back to that here in a few minutes.
[01:13:38.239 --> 01:13:40.819]  And I intend to open the phones up as well and cover all this other news.
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:44.600]  But because I didn't do it in the first hour, let me do it now.
[01:13:45.079 --> 01:13:48.119]  Let me ask listeners, would you like to keep us on the air?
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.720]  Would you like to give liberty a major victory?
[01:13:50.859 --> 01:13:52.960]  Would you like us to continue to give you tomorrow's news today?
[01:13:53.279 --> 01:13:56.600]  Would you like us to continue to reach conservatively 70 million people a day?
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:03.500]  Would you like to stop World War III? Would you like to secure the border?
[01:14:03.579 --> 01:14:04.960]  Would you like to stop inflation?
[01:14:05.079 --> 01:14:07.159]  Would you like to get energy prices down by half?
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:08.260]  Trump has a plan to do it, and he will.
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:11.100]  Would you like to see him in office in 59 days?
[01:14:11.979 --> 01:14:18.739]  Would you like to find the missing 325,000 kids, the Senate admits in their own reports are there, that Harris shipped in with Mayorkas?
[01:14:18.779 --> 01:14:19.859]  Would you like to see them prosecuted?
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:22.899]  Would you like to see the lawfare stopped against the American people?
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:26.520]  Would you like to see the harassment of conservatives and populists come to an end?
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.699]  Would you like to see Fauci prosecuted?
[01:14:29.659 --> 01:14:32.119]  Well then, this is the broadcast for you.
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:37.260]  And I see people comment, it's a minority, and they say, why is Jones always fundraising?
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:39.579]  Well, I'm not Elon Musk.
[01:14:40.699 --> 01:14:44.359]  Who spent billions defending his agenda and lost tens of billions in censorship.
[01:14:45.239 --> 01:14:46.640]  Who's got the money to do it.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:48.779]  And the guts.
[01:14:49.039 --> 01:14:53.840]  I'm not Trump that had 15, 16 billion dollars eight years ago and now something like 6 billion.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:55.319]  Yeah.
[01:14:56.319 --> 01:14:57.500]  He says, I don't care about the money.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.180]  I'm, you know, but it's hurting bad.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:04.500]  I mean, every time I sit at Trump Hotel in D.C., they pulled fire alarms over and over again.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.600]  They said, yeah, that was all night.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:06.239]  The left does it.
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.520]  Two or three times a night.
[01:15:09.979 --> 01:15:15.520]  We're good to go.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:29.500]  We're good to go.
[01:15:34.770 --> 01:15:42.689]  And the thousands of lawyers they had in counties around the country and to file suits just to get in and to be able to watch what they were bringing in at 3 a.m.
[01:15:42.710 --> 01:15:44.529]  in those trucks and 2 a.m.
[01:15:44.609 --> 01:15:45.130]  and 1 a.m.
[01:15:46.810 --> 01:15:52.869]  So you gave Trump billions of dollars and he put Laura Trump in there and she did a great job.
[01:15:53.670 --> 01:15:56.550]  And we mitigated the fraud and we got a landslide.
[01:15:57.649 --> 01:16:01.250]  Not as big as it would have been, but a landslide.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:04.939]  Popular and Electoral College.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.960]  And they're still got the election going, trying to steal those that are getting caught and saying, we don't care, we are stealing them.
[01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:10.960]  Trump's bad.
[01:16:11.359 --> 01:16:12.359]  Pennsylvania, other places.
[01:16:12.579 --> 01:16:13.539]  People are getting indicted.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:14.380]  All over the country.
[01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:19.479]  So, you engage the enemy to show the corruption.
[01:16:19.479 --> 01:16:20.979]  You don't give up because it's corrupt.
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:29.420]  So, because you got off the bench and kicked New World Order ass in the info war, we've got a major victory.
[01:16:30.449 --> 01:16:32.069]  We won a major battle.
[01:16:32.529 --> 01:16:33.630]  The war's not over.
[01:16:34.729 --> 01:16:44.750]  So, they tried to throw us out of the office on May 31st, another Justice Department official that the Justice Department put in my bankruptcy case.
[01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:49.409]  I stood against it, had the lawyers, went and had the hearing, the judge fired them.
[01:16:49.810 --> 01:16:52.250]  Then they said, well, the new trustee said, we want to sell it.
[01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:56.569]  I said, yeah, but it's a free and open auction.
[01:16:58.210 --> 01:17:02.050]  My debt's non-dischargeable, no matter how much money I give, it never goes away, unless it's a billion and a half bucks.
[01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:03.210]  I said, sure.
[01:17:04.529 --> 01:17:07.609]  And then they rigged that and got caught doing that, and we're fighting there.
[01:17:07.729 --> 01:17:10.270]  And then they turned off the internet, so I couldn't do the show.
[01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:15.210]  Last Thursday, I went to the Alex Jones Network backup that you paid for supporting me.
[01:17:16.689 --> 01:17:18.430]  See, I'll never give up if you back me.
[01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:24.890]  I'm like a tractor, just keeps plowing, but it's got to have diesel.
[01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:28.010]  Gotta have oil occasionally!
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.500]  So, I am your war machine.
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:33.760]  I am your sentinel.
[01:17:34.239 --> 01:17:36.159]  I am 100% committed.
[01:17:36.359 --> 01:17:37.960]  I love fighting tyranny.
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:45.220]  This is a real honor and a real pleasure that you have commissioned me for 30-plus years in the fight against these people.
[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:57.180]  But I am up against the Democrats and the deep state and the DOJ, and they have put in the court filings, last time I checked, in the last seven years suing me, $79 million.
[01:17:59.439 --> 01:18:10.260]  It is approaching $16 million that I have spent of your money fighting them and holding on while we did our important work.
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:23.720]  You invested money in freedom and liberty in your own defense and no investment other than Trump that you invested time, money, prayer and energy in paid off like we did.
[01:18:24.539 --> 01:18:27.779]  We delivered the goods to you.
[01:18:29.729 --> 01:18:30.750]  I bet on you.
[01:18:31.710 --> 01:18:32.829]  You bet on me.
[01:18:33.029 --> 01:18:34.130]  We are family.
[01:18:34.569 --> 01:18:36.210]  I don't worry about getting killed.
[01:18:36.409 --> 01:18:37.810]  I don't worry about getting put in prison.
[01:18:37.989 --> 01:18:39.149]  And Lord knows they've tried.
[01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:41.449]  By the grace of God and his angels, I'm still here.
[01:18:41.569 --> 01:18:43.130]  But whatever happens, I don't blame God.
[01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:44.369]  I knew what I got into.
[01:18:44.689 --> 01:18:45.489]  I'm fully committed.
[01:18:45.670 --> 01:18:47.289]  I've seen our spectacular success.
[01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:48.029]  Praise Jesus.
[01:18:48.210 --> 01:18:48.909]  All glory to God.
[01:18:49.029 --> 01:18:50.649]  And I am so honored.
[01:18:51.069 --> 01:18:53.909]  If today was my last day and they killed me today, which I don't want to happen.
[01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:54.569]  I'm not suicidal.
[01:18:54.649 --> 01:18:55.189]  I would...
[01:18:57.819 --> 01:18:59.239]  I would be honored and blessed.
[01:19:00.479 --> 01:19:13.840]  If I got out of my car tonight and they tasered me and threw me in a van and took me to some warehouse and pulled my teeth out with pliers, I would be praising God to the minute they blew my brains out.
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:17.600]  Because I did what I wanted to do.
[01:19:17.739 --> 01:19:19.140]  I felt the Holy Spirit.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:20.399]  I took the mission.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:31.829]  When the angel came with the commission 25 years ago, 26 years ago, And told me what was going to happen and said, are you willing to die?
[01:19:31.890 --> 01:19:33.869]  Are you willing to have your family attacked?
[01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:35.409]  Are you willing to be demonized?
[01:19:35.789 --> 01:19:41.270]  The first part of the commission was, let us give you a little taste of different scenarios.
[01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:46.470]  And I sat there for 20 minutes just downloading all of it.
[01:19:46.989 --> 01:19:48.270]  Trillions of thoughts racing.
[01:19:49.729 --> 01:19:51.770]  And I said, yes, yes, yes.
[01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:55.069]  And it was the message, because you want to save the children.
[01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:58.170]  Because you know they're in bondage.
[01:19:58.289 --> 01:19:59.470]  Because you know they're being tortured.
[01:19:59.689 --> 01:20:00.949]  Because you know they're being hurt.
[01:20:01.210 --> 01:20:02.630]  We are here.
[01:20:02.850 --> 01:20:03.850]  God sent us.
[01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:06.090]  We were there when you were three years old.
[01:20:06.369 --> 01:20:07.569]  In the bed at night.
[01:20:07.909 --> 01:20:09.609]  And the Holy Spirit visited you.
[01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:11.390]  And we showed you the pain of the children.
[01:20:11.609 --> 01:20:12.609]  And you cried.
[01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:14.109]  And the connection was there.
[01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:15.670]  And we've been preparing you.
[01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:17.310]  And that's why all these bad things happen to you.
[01:20:17.369 --> 01:20:18.829]  And that's why evil's always attacked you.
[01:20:18.909 --> 01:20:20.229]  We were making you strong.
[01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:21.710]  And God loves you.
[01:20:21.810 --> 01:20:23.189]  And God is raising you up.
[01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:25.489]  Now, do you want the mission, son?
[01:20:25.989 --> 01:20:27.350]  I want the mission.
[01:20:27.649 --> 01:20:30.510]  And I spiritually signed the contract.
[01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:40.510]  And then instantly flattened with blasting knowledge of how to take down the new order.
[01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:41.449]  I couldn't even understand.
[01:20:43.829 --> 01:20:47.090]  For another hour until they started coming over saying we're closing.
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:21:01.380]  God waited until I was in a restaurant, already worked all day, sitting there thinking about God, understanding the mission, and then a little bit of the fear, and I'm like, what is that?
[01:21:01.899 --> 01:21:02.880]  Well, this is big.
[01:21:02.979 --> 01:21:03.619]  This is the future.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:04.720]  Well, what's going on?
[01:21:04.819 --> 01:21:08.960]  And feeling the incredible presence of power, not in me, around me.
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:13.380]  And then the communication.
[01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:21.670]  And I want to stay with that.
[01:21:22.810 --> 01:21:24.369]  I mean, this is not a burden.
[01:21:25.369 --> 01:21:27.489]  This is not...
[01:21:27.489 --> 01:21:30.409]  This is a blessing.
[01:21:33.069 --> 01:21:36.869]  And supporting what I do is supporting your own future.

[01:24:21.069 --> 01:24:23.149]  General Flynn is in an emergency meeting.
[01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:25.609]  He'll probably be joining us later, if not tomorrow or this evening.
[01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:30.069]  He's coming to town as well Sunday, Monday.
[01:24:31.609 --> 01:24:33.909]  He's got basically the same analysis I've got.
[01:24:34.939 --> 01:24:35.960]  I want to do this.
[01:24:36.159 --> 01:24:41.239]  I want to drill through more details because I've already given you the breakdown gestalt.
[01:24:41.399 --> 01:24:43.760]  I know most of you know this or more than I know.
[01:24:44.319 --> 01:24:47.600]  Depending on the area, I'm not claiming to be saying things that most of you don't know.
[01:24:48.100 --> 01:25:00.579]  But remember, it's the lost sheep that God has commissioned us to at least give the message to so that they can make a decision to join us or harden their hearts and cut themselves off from God.
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:06.819]  But I do want to open the phones up For several hours, and I'm going to start that now.
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:12.739]  So let's get the phone system fired up.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.300]  Let's get Harmon in the cockpit to take those calls.
[01:25:16.779 --> 01:25:19.800]  And I'll start taking your calls here in about 10-15 minutes.
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:26.539]  Then I'll intersperse it with all the rest of the news and the clips and the insanity, and there's quite a bit of it.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:38.399]  But if you just joined us, I... Went to a legal meeting yesterday at about 5.
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:44.600]  And I was in a little bit north of here, about 10 miles away.
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.119]  And I was already supposed to be back about 6.30, but I was late.
[01:25:50.079 --> 01:25:53.560]  And I called Rob Dew that was still here.
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:56.199]  Great camera guy, fast editor.
[01:25:56.539 --> 01:25:57.579]  I was shooting a report.
[01:25:58.199 --> 01:26:04.239]  And I was sending back and forth with General Flynn and with the producers.
[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:09.420]  Dealing with how Putin would probably respond.
[01:26:11.359 --> 01:26:27.380]  And we were looking at Russia running nuclear attack simulations on national TV, and I said, yeah, that's a deterrent, unlike what the West is doing, an accelerant, an escalation.
[01:26:28.659 --> 01:26:36.619]  And I came to the conclusion he would test a Nuclear weapon delivery system without the nukes.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:39.420]  And like I said, I hit traffic.
[01:26:40.079 --> 01:26:41.060]  It was really bad.
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.979]  My youngest daughter was calling and saying, when are you home?
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:44.439]  When are you home?
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:45.079]  I want to play.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:46.539]  She's seven.
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.439]  She's good.
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:51.359]  And I just called her and I said, go home to your family.
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:52.960]  We won't get done until nine o'clock tonight.
[01:26:53.939 --> 01:26:56.439]  And if I get up there...
[01:26:56.439 --> 01:26:57.140]  So I went home.
[01:26:57.899 --> 01:26:59.739]  And then before the show, I'm researching.
[01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:01.420]  And...
[01:27:02.949 --> 01:27:13.109]  I say, I'm going to write the show headline explaining, we'll put the headline that I put out, one headline about Trump and Musk behind the scenes trying to broker a peace deal.
[01:27:13.529 --> 01:27:14.930]  That's pretty much already in the news.
[01:27:15.109 --> 01:27:15.850]  That's a big deal.
[01:27:15.970 --> 01:27:17.149]  I'll talk about that in a moment.
[01:27:17.229 --> 01:27:17.890]  That's really big.
[01:27:18.369 --> 01:27:25.729]  But I also put out the headline on AJN Live, on Axel, put it up there for the live show feed.
[01:27:26.839 --> 01:27:36.479]  That this was an intercontinental ballistic nuclear delivery system test to show NATO that they can't stop a nuclear attack if that comes.
[01:27:36.779 --> 01:27:43.939]  And that Russia does have modernized systems to counter all the talk that Russia's bluffing Putin is.
[01:27:43.979 --> 01:27:44.840]  I am not bluffing.
[01:27:45.899 --> 01:27:47.479]  And so that's a big deal.
[01:27:48.689 --> 01:27:59.250]  Global exclusive, Russia's successful ICBM attack on Ukrainian weapons factory was a clear demonstration that Putin's nuclear force delivery systems can defeat anti-missile defense systems.
[01:27:59.489 --> 01:28:02.050]  That was published at exactly 11 a.m.
[01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:04.909]  Central, pre-programmed into the X system.
[01:28:05.449 --> 01:28:06.689]  Now, I went on...
[01:28:08.439 --> 01:28:15.659]  At 11am and two minutes in, said Trump and Elon are behind the scenes trying to broker a deal.
[01:28:15.819 --> 01:28:16.399]  I've confirmed that.
[01:28:16.539 --> 01:28:17.180]  That's good news.
[01:28:17.319 --> 01:28:18.800]  Trump's not just silent on this for no reason.
[01:28:19.279 --> 01:28:21.159]  I explained what was going to break down there.
[01:28:21.279 --> 01:28:29.859]  If they're successful, it'll be a peace deal and a ceasefire until Trump is sworn in in 59 days.
[01:28:30.039 --> 01:28:31.039]  There'll be a major peace summit.
[01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:40.810]  And in promises of economic support to Ukraine to rebuild and promises to Russia of no more NATO expansion or weapons systems on their border.
[01:28:43.289 --> 01:28:52.210]  And then I was going to get into the fact that obviously the deep state during that ceasefire, if that does happen, will try to stage some provocations to get the shooting going again.
[01:28:52.210 --> 01:28:53.010]  That's a no-brainer.
[01:28:53.899 --> 01:29:01.000]  And then, of course, just to illustrate that the media is like, why do you fire a ballistic missile?
[01:29:01.119 --> 01:29:01.640]  What's that mean?
[01:29:01.659 --> 01:29:06.920]  Why do you blow up this weapons factory, this munitions complex?
[01:29:07.659 --> 01:29:09.460]  And I searched it out before I went live.
[01:29:09.579 --> 01:29:16.159]  No one was reporting this was a nuclear weapon delivery platform test with conventional munitions.
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:35.109]  And then 10 minutes into the show, Putin went live and I did a seven-minute national address, and we've got it queued up to the point we'll play in a moment, where he explained this was a test to show people that their hypersonic missiles could evade the NATO systems.
[01:29:36.689 --> 01:29:42.569]  And again, I'm not harping on this to say, oh, wow, look, you know how I nailed this.
[01:29:44.170 --> 01:29:54.899]  I'm trying to explain to people that when you see Lloyd Austin and The rest of the neocon lunatics, like John Bolton, all over television, saying Russia's bluffing.
[01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:58.020]  Just type in, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Russia bluffing.
[01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:04.279]  Former National Security Advisor, Bolton.
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:10.380]  Putin bluffing.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.319]  None of that's true.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.279]  Russia said there are these red lines, stop expanding for 20 years.
[01:30:19.050 --> 01:30:26.590]  And then once they got in a hot war, in the proxy war in Ukraine, they took Crimea, what, six, seven years ago?
[01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:35.050]  And then said, if you don't stop it, we'll take another third of the country and we'll destroy the Ukrainian NATO forces and we don't want that.
[01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:49.649]  So stop and do not move attackums or storm shadows up to our border or we will consider that an act of war because you can nuclear tip those, you can load those with nukes, And we know you're thinking about shooting them at us.
[01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:51.409]  And how do we know there's not nukes on them?
[01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:53.149]  So we see a bunch of them coming.
[01:30:53.329 --> 01:30:56.250]  We're going to go to nuclear war because we don't know if that's a decapitation attack.
[01:30:56.609 --> 01:31:04.029]  Because if they don't shoot those down or go to full war, then their nuclear forces won't get off the ground and they've been caught with their pants down.
[01:31:04.869 --> 01:31:06.489]  This is nuclear doctrine, folks.
[01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.609]  All right?
[01:31:08.989 --> 01:31:16.189]  You think the United States would let Russia overthrow, say, Mexico or Canada and then station troops on our border and aim missiles at us?
[01:31:18.819 --> 01:31:21.979]  Would they accept firing the missiles into the United States?
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:23.560]  We're in their backyard.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.460]  The globalists started this.
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:29.640]  It's not Russia running around the world invading 20-something countries in the last couple decades.
[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:31.859]  It's our criminal government.
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:35.000]  It's not Russia cutting off the Keystone pipeline and oil drilling licenses.
[01:31:35.239 --> 01:31:40.420]  It's not the Russian government shutting down huge amounts of the farms in England.
[01:31:41.859 --> 01:31:57.939]  In the Netherlands, in Germany, in France, in Ireland, in Sri Lanka, and saying it's the Great Reset, we're getting rid of farming because, quote, particularly,
[01:31:58.319 --> 01:32:04.939]  quote, John Kerry, the Leninguardian, I'm not joking, this is not a joke, organic farming is the worst.
[01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:13.869]  John Kerry, Farming is the third largest source of greenhouse gases that are part of the planet's atmosphere and are good, part of the life cycle.
[01:32:14.130 --> 01:32:14.989]  Didn't say that part.
[01:32:15.329 --> 01:32:19.229]  And we need to get rid of half the farming on Earth.
[01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:20.850]  You want to see the videos from this year and last year?
[01:32:24.449 --> 01:32:30.789]  And now they've cut off over a third of the fertilizer being produced in Europe.
[01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:38.090]  The Europe, counting Ukraine, is the largest producer of fertilizer in the world.
[01:32:39.170 --> 01:32:42.130]  And you cut a third of it, last time I checked, I think it's more now.
[01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:44.689]  What happens when you cut the fertilizer?
[01:32:44.689 --> 01:32:46.590]  That cuts the food yield.
[01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:53.069]  And so, London Guardian headline, organic farming is the worst for the environment.
[01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:59.289]  I mean, that's like saying, taking cyanide is good for your health.
[01:33:00.569 --> 01:33:04.500]  So, Yeah, there's Kerry saying, we've got to restrict the farms.
[01:33:04.619 --> 01:33:05.539]  We've got to cut the food.
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:09.039]  And he goes on to say, or people will starve.
[01:33:11.779 --> 01:33:26.279]  So what they do is they pump out propaganda that's meant to be pure crap, but with authority to just get people conditioned to accept anything, like two men can have a baby, or there's no X and Y chromosomes, or we're going to let men be in women's sports, including boxing, and beat women up.
[01:33:27.850 --> 01:33:33.109]  Yeah, there's the MIT. Sorry, organic farming is actually worse for climate change.
[01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:38.329]  So, and the headlines everywhere.
[01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:41.130]  London Guardian, AP Reuters, New York Times.
[01:33:42.029 --> 01:33:43.449]  It's also in all those publications.
[01:33:43.689 --> 01:33:44.529]  Humans are bad.
[01:33:44.630 --> 01:33:45.449]  We should get rid of all humans.
[01:33:45.529 --> 01:33:46.329]  The future is not human.
[01:33:46.649 --> 01:33:47.810]  Looking forward to the end of humans.
[01:33:48.010 --> 01:33:49.329]  Why the future doesn't need us.
[01:33:50.029 --> 01:33:51.569]  Why we don't need a human future.
[01:33:51.789 --> 01:33:52.810]  Just type in everything I said.
[01:33:52.949 --> 01:33:53.789]  You'll pull it up from them.
[01:33:54.369 --> 01:33:56.850]  Do those sound like good guys to you?
[01:33:58.699 --> 01:34:03.039]  How more organic farming could be worse for global warming?
[01:34:03.119 --> 01:34:05.220]  PBS, the NewsHour.
[01:34:10.439 --> 01:34:12.579]  So did Vladimir Putin do that?
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:29.989]  No, he announced eight years ago that Russia's main initiative, when he cut defense spending by 40%, Was to put the money into organic farming and for Russia to be the leader in organic farming and good food in the world.
[01:34:30.689 --> 01:34:32.109]  Make the world healthy again.
[01:34:33.670 --> 01:34:38.810]  That would not be MAHA, but would make the world healthy again.
[01:34:38.909 --> 01:34:39.869]  What would that acronym be?
[01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:42.170]  Organic food could be worse for the environment.
[01:34:42.409 --> 01:34:47.869]  More land and use to grow crops, which emits up to 70% more carbon.
[01:34:49.210 --> 01:34:50.710]  Dun, dun, dun.
[01:34:52.210 --> 01:34:53.750]  You know you're a carbon-based life form.
[01:35:01.710 --> 01:35:06.210]  You know you're the carbon the globalists want to reduce, right?
[01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.729]  You know that.
[01:35:06.869 --> 01:35:07.649]  Bill Gates has said that.
[01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:11.029]  So, and Elon Musk says, look, I think we should have more kids.
[01:35:11.029 --> 01:35:11.909]  Here's the actuaries.
[01:35:12.010 --> 01:35:19.770]  We don't have 2.1 kids for every two adults, for every family, for every marriage, for every men and women that get together and procreate.
[01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.930]  Reproduce.
[01:35:23.930 --> 01:35:28.189]  In all the numbers, it's a fact, you have a civilizational collapse.
[01:35:29.050 --> 01:35:32.390]  Well, Italy's at 1.3, Japan's at 1.2, if I could go on.
[01:35:32.630 --> 01:35:38.430]  The U.S. indigenous population, whether it be black, white, Hispanic, and American citizens born here, is about 1.7.
[01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:47.409]  So then you're told we need replacement migration with a bunch of brainwashed third world populations.
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:55.100]  So, that's where we are.
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:00.260]  And Russia's not doing any of that.
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:02.140]  Is Russia funding drag queen story time?
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:04.180]  With convicted pedophiles with your children?
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:10.760]  Is Russia opening the border up and doing giant human trafficking for slave labor and sex slavery?
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:11.619]  Oh, no, not Russia.
[01:36:12.699 --> 01:36:15.460]  Did Russia get all our troops killed in all these funny wars?
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:15.760]  No.
[01:36:17.239 --> 01:36:19.220]  Maybe Russia attacked us in World War II? No.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.180]  The West attacked Russia?
[01:36:22.170 --> 01:36:27.010]  British intelligence, on record, put the Bolsheviks in in 1917.
[01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:38.409]  And then our own establishment, it wasn't the Rosenbergs, our own government gave them the atomic secrets.
[01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:46.770]  Because Russia was a captured, globalist, leftist, Jacobin, satanic command base.
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:50.140]  And now Russia's gotten free of that.
[01:36:50.399 --> 01:36:55.680]  And the globalists are so incredibly angry about it.
[01:36:56.619 --> 01:37:00.039]  So we have a kinship with the Russians because they have the same enemies as us.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:04.840]  And that's why the New World Order is making its move.
[01:37:06.319 --> 01:37:07.359]  They're your enemy.
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:09.399]  They're Russia's enemy, China.
[01:37:11.190 --> 01:37:13.270]  1949, CIA puts Mao Zedong in.
[01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:15.529]  Let's see, murder 80-plus million of his own people.
[01:37:15.609 --> 01:37:19.449]  Then when they're finally ready, 1974, they make the deal.
[01:37:19.729 --> 01:37:23.869]  By the 90s, half our industry's been shipped over there.
[01:37:25.569 --> 01:37:34.750]  Then China, 11 years ago, double-crosses the New World Order, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, and says, we're the global dominant system.
[01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:37.409]  We're taking over with the transhumanism and all the crap.
[01:37:37.670 --> 01:37:39.289]  They end the one-child policy.
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:41.319]  Now they have a three-child.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:42.779]  They want you to have policy.
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:45.939]  Now they've broken with the globalists.
[01:37:46.039 --> 01:37:48.279]  They're still absolutely evil at the top.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:50.359]  They said, oh, nice plan.
[01:37:50.619 --> 01:37:51.380]  We'll take it.
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:57.399]  Just like Hitler and Stalin, allies in the first two years of World War II, then they turn against each other.
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:02.500]  So you've got the globalists over Europe, the United States, and the Western world.
[01:38:02.819 --> 01:38:04.979]  You've got the Russians trying to run their own deal.
[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:09.199]  You've got the CHICOMs running the globalist operation but double-crossing the globalists.
[01:38:09.909 --> 01:38:12.189]  And you've got a big, giant mess.
[01:38:18.909 --> 01:38:34.229]  So it's pretty big news that according to my sources, Trump and Elon Musk aren't just talking to Zelensky telling him he needs a ceasefire until Trump gets in in 59 days.
[01:38:34.649 --> 01:38:35.989]  It is also...
[01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:41.229]  Happening with Putin, because I made some phone calls.
[01:38:41.949 --> 01:38:50.069]  So Trump is not silent on this in the last three days since the United States started bombing with precision nuclear-capable missiles.
[01:38:50.489 --> 01:38:54.810]  Not nukes on them, but they can be put in there quickly.
[01:38:57.529 --> 01:39:02.850]  And Putin comes out signaling this yesterday.
[01:39:03.859 --> 01:39:04.619]  Here's the headline.
[01:39:05.479 --> 01:39:14.760]  Putin reportedly opened a ceasefire, talks with Trump, but demands Ukraine drop NATO bid, gives up land.
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.779]  Well, that's always been the plan.
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:32.060]  He said two and a half years ago, or almost three when he invaded, he said we're going to take a third of the country, we're going to build a demilitarized zone, and we're going to destroy the Ukrainian NATO-backed military so they can't threaten us again.
[01:39:34.779 --> 01:39:37.479]  So we choose to fight NATO here.
[01:39:40.939 --> 01:39:42.760]  And NATO's been behind the whole thing.
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:45.199]  The global has been behind the whole thing.
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:48.739]  And they just keep doubling down, doubling down on the escalation ladder.
[01:39:49.979 --> 01:39:51.680]  Oh, can't send F-16s.
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:53.100]  In fact, we never put the clip here to say find that.
[01:39:53.739 --> 01:39:54.760]  I think we did.
[01:39:54.899 --> 01:39:57.680]  Where Biden says that's World War III. That's two years ago.
[01:39:58.739 --> 01:40:07.380]  Well, boy, if Abrams tanks for World War III on the threat escalation ladder, if that takes you there, what do attack them and storm shadow missiles do?
[01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:18.319]  And you've got Schultz, the German chancellor, saying, we're not going to fire missiles at Russia, but we are ready for total war with 800,000-man army ready to go.
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:29.260]  And he's on TV saying, prepare for World War III. Putin opens the door to Donald Trump's peace deal, but Ukraine must make huge concessions, will Zelensky accept the plan?
[01:40:29.439 --> 01:40:32.539]  Well, the U.S. cuts the money off in 59 days, they will.
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:37.199]  Putin's offer to talk to Trump is unlikely to end fighting soon.
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:52.420]  Vladimir Putin is set to make bombshell U-turn on ceasefire with Donald Trump peace deal.
[01:40:57.849 --> 01:41:08.390]  So, if Trump is successful, getting Putin to propose it, you'll hear about it in the next, hopefully, next few days.
[01:41:12.289 --> 01:41:21.409]  When that happens, if that happens, the corporate media is going to go absolutely A and say, what is a president-elect doing talking to a foreign leader?
[01:41:21.609 --> 01:41:23.989]  That's legal, lawful, it always happens.
[01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:30.039]  Usually it's funny, they start doing a tour around the world to meet all the world leaders and get ready.
[01:41:30.359 --> 01:41:33.100]  Beforehand, that's standard procedure.
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:37.579]  But just like in 2016, oh no!
[01:41:38.039 --> 01:41:43.819]  I mean, they'd be like, oh my god, will Trump at the G20 or G8, or at the Southern, will he shake Putin's hand?
[01:41:43.819 --> 01:41:45.100]  Oh my god, there he is with Putin!
[01:41:45.699 --> 01:41:48.659]  He's talking to him at the Davos group.
[01:41:48.819 --> 01:41:50.720]  Oh my god, this is illegal, he's a Russian spy.
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:52.000]  Remember all that?
[01:41:54.710 --> 01:41:56.609]  So yeah, Trump is talking to Putin.
[01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:58.750]  Musk is talking to Putin.
[01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:13.729]  Because they know the deep state that's now out in the open is trying to launch a huge escalation of the war to keep Trump out of office during a full war or to hand him a total disaster.
[01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:31.680]  And now Putin's fired a nuclear-capable supersonic ballistic missile That came back in at Mach 10, Mach 15 and couldn't be shot down by NATO to say,
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:34.239]  hey, we can get past your defenses and that could have had nukes on it.
[01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:42.579]  Because the Pentagon, the Secretary of Defense is saying they're bluffing and their weapons aren't any good.
[01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:45.180]  When that's a lie.
[01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:50.439]  Now, how deep the weapons are, how many they've got, that's up for debate.
[01:42:52.079 --> 01:43:00.920]  But if the Russians are outproducing artillery shells three to one of the entire West, what do you think?
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:20.210]  So, a full ten minutes before Vladimir Putin went public at a national televised international address at 1110 Central, We broke why he did it,
[01:43:20.369 --> 01:43:30.510]  why they said it, and I think, yeah, I even said I would imagine an announcement the next day, I didn't say that, from Putin explaining this is a demonstration of their capability.
[01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:34.109]  I had no idea that 10 minutes later he'd be saying it.
[01:43:34.890 --> 01:43:50.750]  Kind of like I didn't know on election night, two-plus hours beforehand, I said Trump will take the stage at Mar-a-Lago at 1.27, And we'll speak before the minute ends.
[01:43:51.090 --> 01:43:53.050]  I just knew again.
[01:43:55.409 --> 01:43:58.829]  And I decided to just show you what I got.
[01:44:00.710 --> 01:44:02.270]  Because God told me, go ahead.
[01:44:02.770 --> 01:44:07.350]  So when I get the tap on the shoulder, and a lot of this, you can figure it out yourself.
[01:44:08.329 --> 01:44:09.810]  You have the knowledge God gave you.
[01:44:09.970 --> 01:44:10.550]  You have the research.
[01:44:10.689 --> 01:44:12.689]  And then it's that final little, here's the time.
[01:44:13.649 --> 01:44:16.869]  It gives you that little spark of extra ego.
[01:44:17.909 --> 01:44:19.590]  So we can beat the bad guys.
[01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:24.930]  But you've got to have courage to follow the orders of God.
[01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:27.529]  We're going to go to break.
[01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:33.850]  I'm going to give the number out right now, the toll-free number to join us and talk about all these big developments, all the politics, all the news.
[01:44:33.949 --> 01:44:35.229]  We're taking first-time calls.
[01:44:35.689 --> 01:44:38.090]  World War III. We're already in the first stages.
[01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.989]  How do we stop it?
[01:44:39.170 --> 01:44:41.210]  How do we get Trump in in 59 days?
[01:44:42.899 --> 01:44:46.539]  Ladies and gentlemen, 877-789-2539.
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:48.579]  877-789-Alex.
[01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:51.260]  877-789-2539.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:53.260]  First-time callers, please.
[01:44:53.899 --> 01:44:55.380]  Only first-time callers.
[01:44:55.539 --> 01:44:56.119]  Thank you.
[01:44:56.659 --> 01:45:00.079]  877-789-2539.
[01:45:00.539 --> 01:45:04.340]  Any of the politics, election news, World War III, how do we stop it?
[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:06.119]  There you go.
[01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:07.979]  Now, we're going to break in a minute and a half.
[01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:11.380]  I think you want to keep this show on the air.
[01:45:11.699 --> 01:45:13.720]  Plus, we've got in products that are amazing.
[01:45:14.079 --> 01:45:15.439]  Let me tell you about this.
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:17.979]  Where is that stack I had?
[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:21.100]  Oh, I meant to go over this, but I'm out of time.
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:25.920]  I just got so many documents and so many articles and so many things here.
[01:45:26.199 --> 01:45:34.520]  I was going to read to you what Irish Seamoss does and why it's this incredible superfood.
[01:45:35.819 --> 01:45:36.479]  Here it is.
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:38.159]  But I don't have time, the time we have left.
[01:45:39.010 --> 01:45:42.310]  But when I tell you something is a superfood, it's right up there with hemp.
[01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:46.909]  It's recognized as probably the superfood.
[01:45:47.050 --> 01:45:53.250]  We have super strong, high quality, private label from one of the top rated companies in the nation.
[01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:54.609]  We just put our name on it.

[01:46:58.859 --> 01:47:01.060]  You support the Second American Revolution.
[01:47:01.359 --> 01:47:02.859]  You exercise your free speech.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.779]  You stand up to the bullies.
[01:47:06.899 --> 01:47:09.119]  You exercise your will.
[01:47:10.359 --> 01:47:15.239]  And it keeps this broadcast, if we're shut down next week, still on the air at the Alex Jones Network.
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:19.600]  It'll be on the radio, the TV, all the same stations.
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:20.619]  It's all set up.
[01:47:21.710 --> 01:47:29.850]  The crew, the studios, all of it, but we need more funds to ensure we're full power when we continue our assault.
[01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:35.260]  So you're literally, in the information war, refueling the aircraft, loading the weapons, arming them.
[01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:43.640]  We've already got a lot of weapons loaded, but we need to be fully loaded when we take off with maximum load for maximum attack when we do our attack runs in the information war.
[01:47:44.539 --> 01:47:48.380]  So, we're on the tarmac right now, making sure everything's straight here.
[01:47:49.159 --> 01:47:51.279]  You need to go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:47:52.250 --> 01:47:55.729]  Beautiful black shirt with an American Eagle and gold, says Trump won.
[01:47:56.170 --> 01:47:57.470]  Beautiful red hoodie.
[01:47:57.569 --> 01:47:58.850]  People are going crazy over that.
[01:47:59.390 --> 01:48:00.729]  White with Trump won.
[01:48:01.489 --> 01:48:03.789]  Today is your Independence Day, 1-20.
[01:48:05.579 --> 01:48:07.560]  Yeah, that's when we really have the Independence Day.
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:09.520]  When we keep them alive and it gets in there.
[01:48:10.039 --> 01:48:10.619]  That's great.
[01:48:11.279 --> 01:48:12.539]  So many new hats.
[01:48:12.739 --> 01:48:14.020]  All of it made right there in Arkansas.

[01:48:18.079 --> 01:48:19.000]  It'll take them weeks to get done.
[01:48:19.079 --> 01:48:19.819]  Not our sponsor.
[01:48:20.020 --> 01:48:20.760]  They're ready right now.

[01:48:47.050 --> 01:48:53.739]  So if you're going to be a supporter, everyone should be a VIP. Here's the facts in 60 seconds.
[01:48:54.039 --> 01:48:58.920]  The Justice Department came into my bankruptcy, has tried to shut us down twice since May.
[01:48:59.199 --> 01:49:00.720]  The latest case was last week.
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:04.039]  The judge shut them down, they were thrown out of the building, crimes were committed.
[01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:05.920]  It's very clear they're in a lot of trouble.
[01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:08.579]  I've filed counter lawsuits, you name it.
[01:49:08.659 --> 01:49:23.670]  If what Alex Jones describes is correct, Steve, that there were other bidders, you know, maybe led by Roger Stone, and he's a hero for putting them together, to try to rescue Infowars and if they had the highest bid and that was ignored, you know,
[01:49:23.729 --> 01:49:26.770]  that's a serious legal issue that will need to be examined.
[01:49:27.029 --> 01:49:28.449]  Infowarsstore.com is in limbo.
[01:49:28.590 --> 01:49:30.229]  If you order there, you'll get your products.
[01:49:30.409 --> 01:49:44.170]  But, thealexjonesstore.com is our great sponsors in Arkansas with t-shirts and great supplements that are funding not just Infowars, but the Alex Jones Network in case this gets shut down in another hearing next week.
[01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:48.159]  So, a lot of people Aren't going to thealexjonesstore.com right now.
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:50.819]  We're getting messages, oh, we don't want to give money to The Onion.
[01:49:51.039 --> 01:49:56.520]  The Onion didn't get Infowars, and they don't own Alex Jones, and they don't own the Alex Jones Network.
[01:49:56.699 --> 01:49:57.579]  I don't even own that.
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:49:58.399]  It's the sponsor.
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:10.590]  So again, when you go there and get great Trump gear, Alex Jones gear, Patriot gear, incredible supplements like Ultimate Seamoss, collectible posters, incredible designer knives and more at thealexjonesstore.com.

[01:50:15.010 --> 01:50:19.529]  Over the weekend, folks, we saw our funds cut in half and people told us, well, we don't want to give it to The Onion.
[01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:21.430]  The Onion does not own me.
[01:50:21.569 --> 01:50:24.770]  They do not own thealexjonesstore.com.

[01:51:20.989 --> 01:51:22.229]  They're trying to shut us down.
[01:51:22.369 --> 01:51:23.170]  We're fighting hard.
[01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:24.189]  We're winning.
[01:51:24.329 --> 01:51:25.989]  But the fight is close.
[01:51:25.989 --> 01:51:31.430]  So we need your prayer, your word of mouth, and your support right now at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:51:49.579 --> 01:51:56.300]  Yeah, I mean, I'm so on top of the news here that I did a lot of plugging at the end of the last segment.
[01:51:56.420 --> 01:52:00.340]  I'm doing some now because we are doing such important work right now.
[01:52:01.279 --> 01:52:07.520]  And the lawsuits we filed against the DOJ operative and the rest of them are devastating.
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:11.640]  And those are public, and we have all the documents of what happened.
[01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:13.100]  And we're going to win.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.220]  But we need your support.
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:20.060]  And so, that's what it comes down to.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:22.060]  I'm not a regular show.
[01:52:25.279 --> 01:52:33.279]  60% of the funds coming in are being spent in our defense, and notice everybody else, like Giuliani, you name it, shut down in a year.
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:36.880]  We've been fighting seven years, and we're on a counteroffensive now.
[01:52:37.060 --> 01:52:38.479]  You'll see a lot more next week.
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:39.279]  I'm going to leave it there.
[01:52:40.399 --> 01:52:43.939]  But my civil rights were violated, and a conspiracy to violate my rights.
[01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:46.390]  And my fight is your fight.
[01:52:46.569 --> 01:52:47.810]  We must stay on the air.
[01:52:48.569 --> 01:52:56.510]  And regardless, the funds come in, they'll go to legal, they'll go to the crew, the operations, the backup, Alex Jones Network, and other systems.
[01:52:57.829 --> 01:53:01.390]  And there are a lot of heavy hitters who want to come in and help us.
[01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:07.260]  And that is being worked on, but I will not have anything I say controlled.
[01:53:08.079 --> 01:53:15.060]  So I need your support so I can do it and I can be in charge of the broadcasting.
[01:53:15.539 --> 01:53:16.560]  And that's what it's all about.
[01:53:16.779 --> 01:53:23.140]  So please go now to thealexjonesstore.com, get the great supplements, great Patriot gear and more, and go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:26.100]  That's the coordinates for great products to help us win this fight.
[01:53:26.199 --> 01:53:26.920]  Our fight is your fight.
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:27.579]  Take action now.
[01:53:27.699 --> 01:53:28.760]  We'll go to your calls and news right ahead.
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:30.560]  We now take you live.
[01:53:31.319 --> 01:53:35.260]  To the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:38.039]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:40.220]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:53:41.939 --> 01:53:43.939]  Alright, we've got loaded phone lines.
[01:53:44.199 --> 01:53:47.039]  A ton of political, economic, military news.
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:51.960]  Matt Gaetz withdrawing his candidacy.
[01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:53.739]  His nomination.
[01:53:54.899 --> 01:53:59.720]  His appointment to be confirmed by the Senate as the Attorney General.
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:05.359]  Trump was not behind that, I can tell you.
[01:54:05.659 --> 01:54:17.260]  He was still saying this morning he was for Matt, but Matt has said that it is a distraction and that he doesn't want to do that, and Trump has said he will still be a big part of the administration.
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:20.880]  Trump responded saying he was doing very well.
[01:54:23.319 --> 01:54:27.899]  So, they're going to hit him with the sex allegations.
[01:54:27.899 --> 01:54:28.979]  They're hitting RFK Jr.
[01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:38.949]  with it because he's going after Pfizer and Moderna and Bill Gates, who actually hang out at Epstein Island all those times with Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:54:39.890 --> 01:54:42.569]  So, people want the rebels.
[01:54:42.869 --> 01:54:44.869]  People don't care about all this made-up crap.
[01:54:45.289 --> 01:54:46.989]  The DOJ couldn't even charge him.
[01:54:47.090 --> 01:54:47.689]  There was nothing there.
[01:54:50.649 --> 01:54:54.390]  So, that's what we got here.
[01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:56.829]  That's all they got.
[01:54:57.670 --> 01:54:58.729]  Oh my God.
[01:55:00.439 --> 01:55:09.779]  You know, 13, 14 years ago, Gates took some women shopping, bought them something.
[01:55:09.939 --> 01:55:10.800]  Oh my gosh, so evil.
[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:15.680]  Did he go to Epstein Island with 12-year-old, 13-year-old girls?
[01:55:16.439 --> 01:55:19.520]  Like, 27 times, whatever we know of with Bill Gates?
[01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:20.399]  No.
[01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:26.600]  Did he blackmail people with sex with children like P. Diddy and the rest of them?
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:26.859]  No.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.060]  That's why The View came out.
[01:55:31.079 --> 01:55:33.640]  I meant to play it yesterday and said he's a sex trafficker of children.
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:38.000]  Boy, they came back and did a retraction real quick because that's not true.
[01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:43.600]  Now, the people with sex trafficking children confirmed the Senate report are Mayorkas and Harris.
[01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:50.880]  See, in giant industrial scale, the UN, they've all been caught doing it in masks.
[01:55:55.890 --> 01:56:01.130]  It's like saying a freckle on Matt Gaetz's knee is a giant crime.
[01:56:06.510 --> 01:56:10.569]  And these people are burning down society around us.
[01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:20.289]  Yeah, watch Sonny Hauston awkwardly reads legal notice on air after making false claims about Trump's AG pick Matt Gaetz.
[01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:34.350]  Yeah, I sent it to you a couple days ago, never got to it, because I've been covering World War III, but it's important that I seen another one, I think, last night that's a compilation of what she said, and then three minutes later, her retraction.
[01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:38.069]  And look, she's doing that to hurt him.
[01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:41.189]  It's malice of Thor thought, intent to do harm, but she corrected it.
[01:56:41.489 --> 01:56:44.569]  And under the law, she is not liable.
[01:56:47.770 --> 01:56:50.649]  But see, I didn't even do the things the media said I did.
[01:56:51.529 --> 01:57:05.710]  They de-platformed me so I couldn't defend myself and then made up stuff I supposedly did with PR firms to raise money for the Brady Violence Policy Center, now the Everytown gun control conglomerate that's run all this.
[01:57:05.710 --> 01:57:08.270]  Now they admit they've been behind the whole persecution the entire town, of course.
[01:57:09.289 --> 01:57:12.550]  Then they raise money saying, Alex Jones is attacking us.
[01:57:12.649 --> 01:57:13.289]  He's being mean to us.
[01:57:14.289 --> 01:57:15.590]  Never happened in the past.
[01:57:16.130 --> 01:57:17.989]  Certainly wasn't happening in the present tense.
[01:57:19.939 --> 01:57:36.319]  Seven, eight years ago, and then after two years of raising money off of me everywhere, saying I'm attacking them, they then sue me, have judges find me guilty, then have show trials, then lie to the federal judge and say that there had been an adjudication in Connecticut that it was non-dischargeable,
[01:57:36.479 --> 01:57:39.579]  even though Connecticut state law says you can't do that until it's final judgment.
[01:57:43.380 --> 01:57:44.939]  And the federal judge says, fine.
[01:57:47.550 --> 01:57:54.329]  Non-dischargeable, meaning I could give them $1,499,000 and that wouldn't be enough.
[01:57:54.770 --> 01:57:56.689]  More money than I can make in 10 lifetimes.
[01:57:58.449 --> 01:58:00.409]  I don't know, with inflation so bad, maybe not.
[01:58:02.670 --> 01:58:06.989]  Maybe a billion dollar notes to buy a loaf of bread like Zimbabwe or the Weimar Republic, Germany.
[01:58:09.729 --> 01:58:10.170]  So...
[01:58:14.050 --> 01:58:16.930]  They are so desperate to get me off the air.
[01:58:17.210 --> 01:58:24.449]  Twice since May 31st, the DOJ has tried to close this building without a court order.
[01:58:28.810 --> 01:58:35.109]  And last week they had a fake auction and cut the internet off so I couldn't be here or I would have stayed.
[01:58:38.050 --> 01:58:49.119]  And so I ran over to the other studio, the Alex Hills Network, And the next morning, we were back in here because they figured out, the judge said we exceeded our authority.
[01:58:49.239 --> 01:58:50.539]  The judge said we shouldn't have done any of this.
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:51.680]  The judge didn't even know there was an auction.
[01:58:51.899 --> 01:58:53.500]  That's all in the hearing.
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:57.180]  You saw Bloomberg had an angry judge's problem with auction.
[01:58:57.439 --> 01:58:59.979]  No, he said that an auction didn't happen.
[01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:03.560]  I've read the transcript on air.
[01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:15.109]  So, here we are a week later, In the building.
[01:59:15.449 --> 01:59:17.789]  We've now been here for a week.
[01:59:20.409 --> 01:59:23.210]  And they still run headlines that The Onion owns this.
[01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:26.310]  What The Onion owns is major liability.
[01:59:29.369 --> 01:59:30.949]  And I'm not just talking about civil.
[01:59:32.869 --> 01:59:35.789]  They still have on their website that they own Infowars.
[01:59:36.609 --> 01:59:38.050]  Global Tetrahedron.
[01:59:40.050 --> 01:59:41.970]  And some of our listeners believe it.
[01:59:46.449 --> 01:59:52.949]  And the InfoWarsStore.com is now down 80-plus percent in sales because people are like, well, we're not going to give them money.
[01:59:56.850 --> 02:00:10.869]  And sales have been way down at the AlexStore.com, which is owned by the folks at Bigley in Arkansas that are the most successful Trump gear maker that sponsor hundreds of shows.
[02:00:12.270 --> 02:00:14.789]  And people think that's owned by The Onion.
[02:00:15.899 --> 02:00:17.359]  And then, I haven't broke this news yet.
[02:00:17.359 --> 02:00:19.020]  See if Rob is done with the video I shot this morning.
[02:00:19.039 --> 02:00:19.739]  I need that soon.
[02:00:20.180 --> 02:00:21.060]  I'll go to your calls.
[02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:25.260]  We're going to break some major news about what happened around here.
[02:00:26.899 --> 02:00:28.979]  Some cyber incidences.
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:37.260]  They already had the Southern Poverty Law Center pay.
[02:00:39.399 --> 02:00:40.699]  That's an intelligence agency.
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:42.520]  They ran the Oklahoma City operation.
[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:43.659]  Look it up.
[02:00:45.010 --> 02:00:46.770]  By the way, I meant to play that earlier in the week.
[02:00:46.890 --> 02:00:48.689]  I seen like a three-minute breakdown.
[02:00:50.170 --> 02:00:50.510]  My...
[02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:54.289]  The Cobert Report on Oklahoma City.
[02:00:54.710 --> 02:00:57.270]  Just people understand how the feds run false flags.
[02:00:57.430 --> 02:00:58.430]  I want to play that a little...
[02:00:58.430 --> 02:00:59.109]  Find that again, please.
[02:00:59.770 --> 02:01:01.210]  I think I said it Monday, or was it Sunday?
[02:01:04.789 --> 02:01:05.130]  And...
[02:01:05.130 --> 02:01:06.909]  They...
[02:01:08.770 --> 02:01:19.270]  Got a former employee who'd quit on okay terms to go work for South by Southwest a year before and to do videos for Matthew McConaughey.
[02:01:20.949 --> 02:01:23.250]  And the guy had been here for about eight, nine years before.
[02:01:24.670 --> 02:01:31.270]  And he comes back and asks for his job three years ago.
[02:01:32.130 --> 02:01:33.569]  And I say, yeah, we need help.
[02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:41.529]  And then he promptly jacks in To the security cameras on the outside of the building.
[02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:46.430]  And in the common areas, you know, at the doors and the inside, there's not audio inside the building.
[02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:51.909]  And then he promptly sits there for over a year.
[02:01:54.869 --> 02:01:56.050]  Committing a clear crime.
[02:01:56.869 --> 02:01:58.109]  Report at the Austin Police Department.
[02:01:59.489 --> 02:02:03.130]  But, you know, in the days of not cutting the police, you don't do anything.
[02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:09.060]  Recording Stuff in the building.
[02:02:09.739 --> 02:02:15.319]  And after a year plus, the worst thing he had was me at midnight after I'd done some show.
[02:02:17.539 --> 02:02:23.260]  Walking around the building by myself, shirtless, with a bottle of vodka in my hand.
[02:02:25.119 --> 02:02:26.279]  Wow, what a criminal.
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:27.520]  What a bad man.
[02:02:27.699 --> 02:02:28.680]  That's the best you got.
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:34.640]  Then they publish all that with a bunch of lies.
[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:41.399]  And that's just a microcosm of what we deal with.
[02:02:45.279 --> 02:02:45.619]  So...
[02:02:45.619 --> 02:02:49.579]  Well, you guys have to do it.
[02:02:49.619 --> 02:02:50.180]  That's going to be ready for me.
[02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:50.359]  Thanks.
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:53.239]  Thank you.
[02:02:53.380 --> 02:02:53.800]  30 minutes.
[02:02:53.979 --> 02:02:54.199]  All right.
[02:02:55.979 --> 02:03:00.539]  So I'm going to break some other big news dealing with all of this.
[02:03:02.079 --> 02:03:05.199]  But someone claiming to be the Onion...
[02:03:11.150 --> 02:03:13.590]  Engaged in a serious cybercrime in the last few days here.
[02:03:15.409 --> 02:03:16.369]  We'll show you all that.
[02:03:17.369 --> 02:03:21.430]  So, when I explain to you these people are desperate...
[02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:30.949]  You know, listeners, when we got turned off last Thursday, we're all over saying, watch out, watch out, they'll plant stuff.
[02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.609]  They're gonna...
[02:03:31.609 --> 02:03:33.369]  And I'm like, ah, they're not that bad.
[02:03:35.109 --> 02:03:37.090]  And I'm sure it's not them...
[02:03:40.630 --> 02:03:42.789]  And it's not one cyber attack.
[02:03:46.689 --> 02:03:56.350]  Since the feds were here, somebody went in and was vandalizing and deleting a bunch of key stuff at Bandot Video.
[02:03:57.390 --> 02:04:01.130]  And we see where they entered in and what they did with the codes.
[02:04:03.149 --> 02:04:06.369]  These are really nice people.
[02:04:10.770 --> 02:04:20.250]  So how it works is the federal government's hijacked by the globalists and they just go out and they find people that will do anything to the American people because they say Alex Jones is bad.
[02:04:21.170 --> 02:04:23.229]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s bad.
[02:04:24.210 --> 02:04:25.250]  Trump is bad.
[02:04:25.449 --> 02:04:26.390]  Elon Musk is bad.
[02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:28.550]  And they are the good guys.
[02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:34.390]  So they don't need to play by any rules because they're the heroes.
[02:04:34.789 --> 02:04:41.270]  And they can overthrow the Ukraine government and start a war 14 years ago and lead it to the verge of nuclear war.
[02:04:41.449 --> 02:04:48.770]  They can smuggle in kids and disappear their identities and put them in slave labor and sex slavery because they're the loving Hollywood liberals.
[02:04:48.949 --> 02:04:49.909]  They're our rulers.
[02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:52.329]  They know best.
[02:04:52.529 --> 02:04:53.609]  They're the bosses.
[02:04:55.390 --> 02:04:57.069]  Well, I got news for you.
[02:04:58.029 --> 02:05:04.130]  I can't break down for everybody exactly how everything will play out on the big scale and on our scale and your scale.
[02:05:04.789 --> 02:05:08.090]  But the world's waking up fast.
[02:05:09.250 --> 02:05:11.550]  People are getting informed really fast.
[02:05:12.489 --> 02:05:13.970]  Humanity has the initiative.
[02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:16.130]  We've turned the tide massively.
[02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:24.770]  There is an explosion in the Great Awakening as a response to the Great Reset and slavery and tyranny and death.
[02:05:25.170 --> 02:05:26.250]  And humans...
[02:05:28.810 --> 02:05:46.210]  Common sense, will to survive, and life force, and instincts, and spirit is kicking back in, and I can tell the bad guys unequivocally,
[02:05:46.470 --> 02:06:02.729]  you are the bad guys, and you know it, and you like it, you bet on the wrong team, you bet on the wrong horse, and It's clear you're not going to give up and roll over because you hate us spiritually.
[02:06:03.590 --> 02:06:04.970]  Because you hate yourself.
[02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:12.930]  And those of us that are good and strong and honorable and decent piss you off because you can see how happy we are.
[02:06:13.569 --> 02:06:15.689]  How strong we are.
[02:06:18.329 --> 02:06:20.310]  How appealing we are.
[02:06:22.829 --> 02:06:24.670]  You are spiritually ugly.
[02:06:25.670 --> 02:06:27.649]  You are spiritually ugly.
[02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:32.779]  You have a spiritual aroma of dead, rotting meat.
[02:06:36.039 --> 02:06:37.819]  You are cut off from God.
[02:06:38.159 --> 02:06:41.260]  You are pathetic, disgusting losers.
[02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:43.479]  And you know you are.
[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:51.539]  And you want to claw us down with you and drag us with you into the open, stinking mouth of hell.
[02:06:55.060 --> 02:06:56.239]  We were asleep.
[02:06:58.689 --> 02:07:00.189]  And by increments we've awoken.
[02:07:01.810 --> 02:07:07.289]  And now that tiny fire of liberty is like a giant sun exploding.
[02:07:07.829 --> 02:07:11.789]  It is like a trillion volcanoes erupting.
[02:07:15.550 --> 02:07:23.869]  I can feel the will of our ancestors coursing through us at one level.
[02:07:25.149 --> 02:07:32.649]  I can feel my current trajectory and destiny in the Zen time continuum of now.
[02:07:33.310 --> 02:07:49.890]  And I can see into the infinite infinity of consciousness and will into the most beautiful unending completion Into the future.
[02:07:50.590 --> 02:07:59.829]  One giant moment in God's mind, constantly being reborn, constantly being rebuilt, constantly expanding.
[02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:11.189]  But without the evil to compare it to, it is not complete.
[02:08:12.850 --> 02:08:15.189]  Without the free will...
[02:08:17.279 --> 02:08:39.060]  Without your choice, without you being given independent, sentient consciousness and God's eye for beauty, you could never recognize the true,
[02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:43.340]  total purity of the Creator.
[02:08:45.659 --> 02:09:03.479]  God gave you consciousness God gave you will God gave you free will God made you in his image and likeness That's why a sunset's beautiful.
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:06.319]  That's why the trees and the wind are beautiful.
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.659]  That's why being good is beautiful.
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:33.140]  That's why you know good from bad, because a spark, a divine shard of God's Consciousness has been bestowed to each and every one of us.
[02:09:38.659 --> 02:09:40.800]  We are not God.
[02:09:43.020 --> 02:09:53.000]  But we were made by God to commune with God, to worship God in total completion forever and ever.
[02:09:54.609 --> 02:09:57.029]  In all times, in all dimensions.
[02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:08.270]  And we become one with God.
[02:10:09.010 --> 02:10:11.090]  We are not God.
[02:10:14.090 --> 02:10:20.350]  We are given the choice to merge with God.
[02:10:21.939 --> 02:10:25.020]  As his bride.
[02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:29.619]  You see male and female all around you.
[02:10:29.859 --> 02:10:31.060]  It's holy.
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:38.939]  God is the man, the will, the directive in chaos.
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:42.800]  The world, the galaxy, the universe.
[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:50.199]  We are the conscious, free world.
[02:10:51.010 --> 02:10:51.829]  Woman.
[02:10:55.130 --> 02:11:00.970]  And then we give birth to the future.
[02:11:08.289 --> 02:11:10.289]  That's in the New Testament.
[02:11:11.689 --> 02:11:15.250]  People read that and don't even know what they're reading.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.300]  That's the secret.
[02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:43.699]  And that's why they're not just attaching the male and the female that is one unity, the species, as if there's a separation.
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:49.659]  There is total balance in the species, in the entity.
[02:11:55.279 --> 02:11:58.300]  They're not just waging war against the male and the female.
[02:11:59.449 --> 02:12:06.770]  They're waging war against all carbon-based regenerative life forms.
[02:12:07.529 --> 02:12:10.529]  This attack is alien.
[02:12:11.810 --> 02:12:14.630]  It is not of God.
[02:12:15.710 --> 02:12:22.789]  It is an attack on all life on Earth.
[02:12:24.239 --> 02:12:31.899]  And all life in the third dimensional space-time continuum.
[02:12:31.899 --> 02:12:34.779]  It is a war against light.
[02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:38.539]  It is a war against heat.
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:43.899]  It is a war against red blood.
[02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:50.659]  Embrace your humanity.
[02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:54.239]  Embrace that you were made by the master creator.
[02:12:54.979 --> 02:13:00.500]  Embrace an interface with God now and we will transcend the enemy forever.
[02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:03.979]  But you must make the decision.
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:07.779]  God is not a rapist.
[02:13:09.819 --> 02:13:13.159]  You must join with God.
[02:13:16.500 --> 02:13:19.560]  You must make the choice to be the bride.
[02:13:21.140 --> 02:13:22.800]  Christ is the groom.
[02:13:24.079 --> 02:13:28.060]  And the universe together is ours.
[02:13:35.399 --> 02:13:36.899]  Alright, I'm going to stop.
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:41.960]  And I'm going to go to break.
[02:13:48.329 --> 02:13:50.329]  It's hard to do a broadcast when the Holy Spirit's the strong.
[02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:55.829]  I am in a place of total completion.
[02:13:57.430 --> 02:14:00.430]  I am in the quiet place of the Most High.
[02:14:01.029 --> 02:14:04.449]  I am in the throne room, in the presence of the Master.
[02:14:06.970 --> 02:14:16.550]  And I wish those of you that have fallen to Satan for one instant could taste of the living waters of the mind of God.
[02:14:18.180 --> 02:14:23.439]  You would throw yourselves down on your knees and beg God to forgive you instantly.
[02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:38.319]  And if you have any inkling of what I'm saying, if you have any tremor in your guts or your mind or your soul, if you feel a chill running up your spine, that's the satanic influence in you that is afraid.
[02:14:41.279 --> 02:14:58.399]  You won't be able to make that force leave you, but God can and will if you simply open the space-time continuum bridge and call down through free will the master.
[02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:08.300]  God has built an incredible system for us.
[02:15:12.710 --> 02:15:14.930]  God is going to let you do what you choose.
[02:15:16.710 --> 02:15:17.829]  I would choose wisely.
[02:15:20.909 --> 02:15:21.449]  All right.
[02:15:23.930 --> 02:15:24.729]  We're going to go to break.
[02:15:25.789 --> 02:15:28.329]  I'm going to come back and go directly to your calls for the rest of the broadcast.
[02:15:29.409 --> 02:15:30.949]  And I'll get into all the rest of the news.
[02:15:32.170 --> 02:15:34.170]  If you missed the first hour, it was very important.
[02:15:35.409 --> 02:15:38.409]  It is posted on X, posted at man.video.
[02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:42.470]  And I cover the fact that Trump's behind the scenes trying to do a peace deal.
[02:15:43.170 --> 02:15:45.470]  And Putin's now responding to that saying he's ready to do a deal.
[02:15:45.609 --> 02:15:46.010]  It's with Trump.
[02:15:47.569 --> 02:15:49.310]  Elon Musk is right in the middle of it as usual.
[02:15:51.569 --> 02:15:54.930]  And I told you why they launched the ICBM as a nuclear...
[02:15:56.460 --> 02:16:00.939]  Test to show that they can destroy any target on Earth they want in 10 minutes.
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:02.779]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:16:03.060 --> 02:16:04.239]  This is the Infowar.
[02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:05.359]  We'll be right back.
[02:16:05.479 --> 02:16:05.939]  Stay with us.
[02:16:06.119 --> 02:16:12.399]  I am cutting this important announcement right in the middle of the November 5th, 2024 election.
[02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:13.960]  We'll be running this for a week or so.
[02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:19.800]  And it looks like a big Trump win, but they are in full steam ahead with election fraud at levels over foreseen.
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:23.739]  Regardless of whether we're able to defeat this fraud or not, the awakening...
[02:16:24.539 --> 02:16:35.500]  And the massive amount of support for Trump and traditional liberals and others waking up and joining us and realizing the Democratic Party allied with the neocons is cancer has been incredible.
[02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:38.200]  And it's part of the larger global realignment happening all over the planet.
[02:16:38.459 --> 02:16:41.459]  But we can't control everything individually.
[02:16:41.459 --> 02:16:43.280]  We can just work towards a better outcome.
[02:16:43.299 --> 02:16:45.120]  And it's a process and we're starting to get traction.
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:46.159]  And I've got faith.
[02:16:46.319 --> 02:17:05.139]  But regardless, with all the garbage and all the viruses out there and all the drug-resistant and Antibiotic-resistant bacteria and crap that's out there, especially in the winter when our immune systems are down, it is so important to boost our body's defenses naturally that God gave us.
[02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:09.040]  Now, if you go to our great sponsor, DrJonesNaturals.com, there's a lot of great products.

[02:17:38.170 --> 02:17:42.930]  And both of these are high-quality, large doses at a very low price.
[02:17:43.649 --> 02:17:49.690]  Most competing brands say of CoQ10 of this quality and this dose, on average, are about $60 a bottle.
[02:17:50.659 --> 02:17:54.260]  This is way, way lower than that, and it funds the Infowar.
[02:17:54.639 --> 02:17:58.440]  And then, of course, quercetin max, really strong, high-powered quercetin.
[02:17:58.559 --> 02:18:01.139]  Let me tell you, in case you don't know, what these do.
[02:18:01.659 --> 02:18:08.360]  CoQ10, massive energy production, cellular power, cleaning out the cells, antioxidant properties, heart health.
[02:18:08.399 --> 02:18:09.159]  This is all on record.
[02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:09.739]  This is admitted.

[02:18:17.530 --> 02:18:20.149]  I mean, you just ask chat GPT this and it'll tell you.
[02:18:20.549 --> 02:18:29.350]  Let's look at quercetin, antioxidant properties, immune system support, anti-inflammatory effects, allergy relief, heart health, antiviral and antibacterial properties.
[02:18:29.430 --> 02:18:30.010]  That's the big one.
[02:18:30.489 --> 02:18:37.389]  Supports respiratory health, blood sugar regulation, improves exercise performance, brain health, cognitive, all of it.
[02:18:37.920 --> 02:18:48.020]  So these are amazing known staples that are so good for your body, your immune system, but not just so you have a better chance of not getting ill.

[02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:44.000]  Thanks for your support.
[02:19:44.100 --> 02:19:46.239]  Now go to drjonesnaturals.com and I thank you for your support.
[02:19:47.629 --> 02:19:53.090]  Alright, I'm going to go to Cynthia, Terry, Kat, Chris, Thomas, Jack, Karen, Brett, Kobe, Ty, others.
[02:19:53.170 --> 02:19:54.809]  Nick Sorter is coming on with big news next hour.
[02:19:54.930 --> 02:19:55.469]  Continue with calls.
[02:19:55.969 --> 02:19:58.850]  I want to get your calls in a moment, but let me just get this out here because I mentioned it earlier.
[02:19:59.209 --> 02:20:09.850]  Here's Biden a year and a half ago saying we can't give, you know, Abrams tanks and stuff to him because that escalates the latter to World War III. Well, now it's heavy missiles that can be nuclear-tipped attacking Russia.
[02:20:11.170 --> 02:20:16.430]  The Pentagon runs around, the Secretary of Defense, all of them say, oh, you don't have any weapons, you don't have, your nukes don't work.
[02:20:16.690 --> 02:20:17.629]  It's all a bluff.
[02:20:17.809 --> 02:20:33.010]  So then they fire an ICBM over, hit this big weapons factory complex with a conventional payload showing that the hypersonic missile couldn't be shot down, couldn't be shot down by the NATO systems,
[02:20:33.010 --> 02:20:39.610]  and reportedly the missiles all hit perfectly right in the roof of each factory.
[02:20:41.020 --> 02:20:44.659]  So, not only can you not shoot it down, we can hit you with conventional weapons.
[02:20:45.500 --> 02:20:57.719]  And if we put hydrogen bombs on here, that one missile, bare minimum, could have taken out the seven or eight major cities.
[02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:01.139]  Because it doesn't need to come right in and hit at point blank range.
[02:21:01.500 --> 02:21:06.139]  The MIRV pops up at altitude, coming back in from space.
[02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:08.379]  There's rockets on the ends.
[02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:14.180]  Once the multiple wrenching devices come in, they're all targeted.
[02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:16.100]  They go off wherever they want to go.
[02:21:16.180 --> 02:21:18.920]  They can come right in at one spot or off.
[02:21:19.159 --> 02:21:21.319]  A lot of times they've got decoys in them.
[02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:26.639]  But if you look at the footage of those MIRVs coming in, there weren't decoys in them.
[02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:30.920]  And you see them basically blasting in on fire.
[02:21:32.020 --> 02:21:33.440]  And Putin talked about that.
[02:21:33.579 --> 02:21:34.959]  So let's back-to-back play Biden.
[02:21:36.239 --> 02:21:51.760]  And then a short clip of this morning, Putin went live at 11.10 Central, Texas time, Chicago time, and we just nailed it.
[02:21:53.149 --> 02:21:56.750]  And I said, I didn't know until 30 after that he'd just been on.
[02:21:57.430 --> 02:22:00.770]  I even said, I would imagine Putin will come out and make this announcement in the next few days.
[02:22:00.909 --> 02:22:02.149]  So he was making it while I said that.
[02:22:02.690 --> 02:22:04.290]  Just again, pointing out what we're talking about here.
[02:22:04.709 --> 02:22:06.709]  Let's go ahead and air both clips back to back.
[02:22:07.750 --> 02:22:09.690]  War against Ukraine will never be a victory.
[02:22:10.069 --> 02:22:15.409]  Democrats are rising to meet the moment, rallying the world on the side of peace and security.
[02:22:15.969 --> 02:22:18.590]  We're showing the strength and we'll never falter.
[02:22:18.790 --> 02:22:33.969]  But, look, the idea, the idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand, and don't kid yourself, no matter what you all say,
[02:22:34.350 --> 02:22:38.649]  that's called World War III. Okay.
[02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:56.030]  As a response to the use of US and UK manufactured weapons, the Russian forces have carried out a combined strike on one of the military industrial facilities in Ukraine.
[02:22:58.090 --> 02:23:07.569]  And this included the test of a novel intermediate range A Russian missile system.
[02:23:08.209 --> 02:23:15.930]  A ballistic missile with a non-nuclear hypersonic payload was used.
[02:23:17.489 --> 02:23:20.129]  The test was carried out successfully.
[02:23:20.569 --> 02:23:23.270]  The objectives of the launch have been met.
[02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:43.389]  One of the largest and well-known industrial centers that is known since the Soviet times In the Dnieper region, which is known to be involved in enemy production,
[02:23:43.709 --> 02:23:44.309]  was hit.
[02:23:45.430 --> 02:23:53.909]  And further, plans are being made in Europe and the Asia-Pacific to deploy weapons and missiles.
[02:23:54.329 --> 02:24:08.000]  And we believe it is a mistake on the part of the United States to destroy the system that was established by the And missile treaty in 2019.
[02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:25.379]  We see that the United States and their allies are now considering and has successfully attested their capabilities to deploy advanced missile systems in different parts of the world.
[02:24:25.559 --> 02:24:30.959]  And their exercises routinely include the use of such weapons.
[02:24:32.260 --> 02:24:46.870]  Russia has unilaterally I refuse to deploy intermediate and small range of missiles until we see similar weapons deployed by the United States in a region of the world.
[02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:56.450]  The use of the novel system, which was essentially an operational test, was carried out in response.
[02:24:57.639 --> 02:25:00.540]  To the decisions made by the United States and their allies.
[02:25:01.100 --> 02:25:08.219]  And the further actions will be considered and decided based on what we see from them.
[02:25:09.319 --> 02:25:15.540]  The further course of action will be determined based on the threats to the security of the Russian Federation.
[02:25:16.059 --> 02:25:27.569]  We believe that we have the right to use our weapons against military facilities of countries who allow Their weapons to be used against ours.
[02:25:28.250 --> 02:25:35.610]  And in case of an escalation, we will act as decisively in a mirror fashion.
[02:25:36.229 --> 02:25:46.170]  The ruling elites of the countries are nurturing plans to use their military contingents against Russia should be warned.
[02:25:48.729 --> 02:26:09.000]  When choosing our measures to be used in response, Such as the use of systems that were tested recently in Ukraine will certainly include warnings to civilians and to clear the zones that will be targeted.
[02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:15.920]  And we will certainly do this Stop right there and pause.
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:21.760]  Conventional weapons hitting military districts do not need civilian warnings.
[02:26:21.940 --> 02:26:27.500]  So that is a clear, which they said a few months ago, they said, instead of going to a full nuclear war, we keep bombing us.
[02:26:28.540 --> 02:26:35.639]  We may declare a military zone, but there's going to be civilians around it.
[02:26:36.659 --> 02:26:38.219]  We're going to tell you to get out of there.
[02:26:38.540 --> 02:26:39.360]  That's a nuke.
[02:26:40.500 --> 02:26:50.159]  So, what Putin's doing right there, make no mistake, just like I told you before he went public, and I didn't need to talk to Putin, and I didn't.
[02:26:50.219 --> 02:26:51.260]  No Russian told me this.
[02:26:51.739 --> 02:27:02.879]  I said, before anybody else, this was a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, hypersonic, to prove it can get past Western defenses and could deliver MIRV vehicles that would be carrying nuclear weapons.
[02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:07.819]  This was a demonstration that Russia can get past defenses and deliver nuclear weapons.
[02:27:08.219 --> 02:27:08.659]  Okay?
[02:27:10.299 --> 02:27:27.500]  And he just said, when you know doctrine and you actually are educated and not illiterate on this, like 99% of people are, 99.999, he just said, if you keep escalating, we will then tell you to clear out of a city,
[02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:29.000]  clear out of an entire area.
[02:27:29.540 --> 02:27:34.020]  I imagine they're going to pick some military district next to a town of, say, 50,000.
[02:27:35.139 --> 02:27:36.600]  So it's easier for people to get out.
[02:27:37.159 --> 02:27:39.219]  It's hard to evacuate a city of millions.
[02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:41.219]  And that happens.
[02:27:41.379 --> 02:27:42.159]  I wasn't told that.
[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:43.639]  I just know how the military works.
[02:27:43.799 --> 02:27:45.579]  The militaries are all the same at this level.
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:48.739]  At the superpower military level.
[02:27:48.879 --> 02:27:50.620]  You can say Russia's not a superpower economically.
[02:27:50.799 --> 02:27:51.879]  They're like the fourth biggest in the world.
[02:27:52.319 --> 02:27:54.399]  You can certainly argue they're a superpower militarily.
[02:27:54.899 --> 02:28:01.180]  And so, Putin is now saying, and believe me, the Pentagon knew exactly what he just said.
[02:28:01.260 --> 02:28:02.379]  It's like clear English to them.
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:07.280]  We are looking to nuke a city as the next demonstration.
[02:28:11.930 --> 02:28:13.489]  There's a lot to unpack in this video.
[02:28:14.510 --> 02:28:18.030]  Now, he issues a stark warning here at the end, another warning, here it is.
[02:28:20.149 --> 02:28:31.729]  And we do not have any fears that it will reduce the effectiveness of those systems, because there is no way to counteract a missile that flies it.
[02:28:32.700 --> 02:28:48.700]  At 10 Mac, which is 2.5 to 3 oms per second, existing anti-missile systems and the anti-missile systems deployed by the United States and Europe cannot intercept such missiles.
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:52.239]  It is impossible.
[02:28:52.739 --> 02:29:00.659]  So, once again, it is not Russia but the United States who have destroyed the system of international security.
[02:29:01.719 --> 02:29:06.700]  And they are trying to preserve their hegemony and stoking a global conflict.
[02:29:07.579 --> 02:29:15.379]  We have always preferred, and we still prefer, to resolve our disagreements using peaceful means.
[02:29:15.459 --> 02:29:18.139]  But we are prepared for any scenario.
[02:29:18.459 --> 02:29:22.139]  And if anyone has any doubts, they shouldn't.
[02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:25.219]  There will always be a response.
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:34.340]  If I had to guess, it was probably something like a Topol-M missile.
[02:29:35.879 --> 02:29:40.100]  And that's one of their new novel missiles that's been deployed the last five years.
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:51.700]  Probably called like a Topol-P or Q. They'll probably announce next week it was a Topol-Q or something.
[02:29:53.139 --> 02:29:54.500]  And that's not even known to exist.
[02:29:54.639 --> 02:29:55.379]  I'm just throwing that out there.
[02:29:55.440 --> 02:29:56.079]  That's how my brain works.
[02:29:56.100 --> 02:29:56.319]  We'll see.
[02:29:56.940 --> 02:29:58.840]  Okay, let's go ahead and...
[02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:01.500]  Go to your phone calls.
[02:30:02.459 --> 02:30:03.620]  You like that last part?
[02:30:06.780 --> 02:30:08.760]  There will be more retaliation.
[02:30:12.139 --> 02:30:19.319]  But the defense secretary, normally missing in action, he's just out saying, don't worry, they don't have anything.
[02:30:20.260 --> 02:30:22.120]  Why, the Russians don't even have electricity.
[02:30:23.260 --> 02:30:25.520]  Cynthia in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:30:26.500 --> 02:30:28.739]  Alex, you're on fire for Holy Ghost today.
[02:30:29.020 --> 02:30:29.379]  Love it.
[02:30:29.500 --> 02:30:29.840]  Love it.
[02:30:29.899 --> 02:30:30.159]  Love you.
[02:30:30.500 --> 02:30:31.500]  A couple of things.
[02:30:31.719 --> 02:30:32.920]  Putin and then Gates.
[02:30:34.219 --> 02:30:39.659]  I know the president, the real president, Donald John Trump, totally understands this man.
[02:30:40.079 --> 02:30:42.280]  So, help me with my naivete.
[02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:47.040]  Why can't he say to Putin, we're getting out of NATO, period.
[02:30:47.440 --> 02:30:48.500]  We've got this.
[02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:50.719]  This is a funeral for the globalists.
[02:30:50.879 --> 02:30:52.139]  I guarantee you.
[02:30:52.930 --> 02:30:54.030]  Call Zelensky.
[02:30:54.290 --> 02:30:55.549]  Hey, cuckoo clocks.
[02:30:55.889 --> 02:30:57.889]  No more money for rebuild.
[02:30:58.129 --> 02:30:59.889]  No money for anything.
[02:30:59.889 --> 02:31:02.850]  Not one red cent if you don't stand down.
[02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:04.590]  So, thoughts on that?
[02:31:05.250 --> 02:31:06.090]  Okay, ma'am.
[02:31:07.149 --> 02:31:08.469]  I appreciate your call.
[02:31:10.229 --> 02:31:12.909]  President Trump is not in office for 59 days.
[02:31:13.090 --> 02:31:14.309]  Let's put the exact time on screen.
[02:31:17.500 --> 02:31:25.139]  He legally and lawfully, and all major presidents of modern history do this, can reach out to world leaders and tell them about the policies and start detente.
[02:31:26.440 --> 02:31:28.319]  He's already done that before he got elected.
[02:31:28.659 --> 02:31:32.000]  And his stated policies of a peace deal and ceasefire and all that's on the table.
[02:31:33.239 --> 02:31:35.719]  Trump has been silent for three days on this.
[02:31:36.379 --> 02:31:38.959]  The video everybody thinks is new is a year old.
[02:31:39.100 --> 02:31:40.180]  I've explained that over and over again.
[02:31:40.540 --> 02:31:43.659]  I have to prove it to even administration people.
[02:31:43.940 --> 02:31:45.399]  The incoming, they don't even know that.
[02:31:46.149 --> 02:31:49.309]  People are so hungry for Trump to say don't do this that they're using a year-old video.
[02:31:49.469 --> 02:31:52.649]  When we aired it on, you know, this week, a bunch, I explained, that's not new.
[02:31:54.469 --> 02:32:00.229]  And I've confirmed that Trump and Elon Musk are talking to Zelensky and are talking to Putin.
[02:32:01.250 --> 02:32:08.110]  And Putin came out yesterday and obviously responds to that and said, I will negotiate a ceasefire deal right now, but I only want to talk to Trump.
[02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:10.969]  Meaning he wants it to be open dialogue with Trump.
[02:32:13.220 --> 02:32:15.280]  So, that's the answer to your question.
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.260]  So, he's not in office yet.
[02:32:20.079 --> 02:32:22.360]  So, that's what's going on here.
[02:32:22.780 --> 02:32:23.959]  Jack in Wisconsin.
[02:32:24.180 --> 02:32:24.860]  Jack, you're on the air.
[02:32:24.959 --> 02:32:25.139]  Welcome.
[02:32:26.579 --> 02:32:27.459]  Hi, Mr.
[02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:27.860]  Jones.
[02:32:28.079 --> 02:32:40.059]  Yeah, regarding the Russia situation, I think like the James Bond villain globalists are obviously like anti-Christian and it's part of the greater spiritual war.
[02:32:40.690 --> 02:32:49.469]  And they don't want Christian conservatism in America and the West and Europe to link up with Russia because it would be just too good.
[02:32:50.209 --> 02:33:01.209]  And it's kind of conducive also to Latin people in America and African American people in America, their culture.
[02:33:01.209 --> 02:33:03.489]  So I think it would kind of be symbiotic.
[02:33:04.100 --> 02:33:19.459]  Yeah, no, I mean, Hollywood, the left, the Carnegie Endowment that runs the CIA admits they don't want Christian culture that's diametrically opposed to their New World Order Great Reset, and so that's why they want Russia destroyed is because it is a Christian country.
[02:33:19.659 --> 02:33:21.620]  I mean, it's not kind of a spiritual battle.
[02:33:21.780 --> 02:33:23.479]  That's what it all, that's what it is.
[02:33:24.899 --> 02:33:31.000]  And, like, it all started back in the 90s with the Clinton administration and the whole stuff in the Balkans.
[02:33:32.449 --> 02:33:34.729]  Yeah, the bombing of Belgrade.
[02:33:35.629 --> 02:33:41.629]  Yeah, the bombing of Belgrade and that it was going to escalate to what we're seeing today.
[02:33:42.129 --> 02:33:48.850]  And I don't know if you've seen online, but in tandem with this escalation with Russia, they're pulling out all the...
[02:33:49.969 --> 02:33:54.690]  Blue Operation Blue Beam and Alien stuff has been real hot recently.
[02:33:55.409 --> 02:33:59.829]  Oh yeah, New York, New Jersey, you know, orbs flying around at Mach 8.
[02:34:00.049 --> 02:34:01.969]  Yeah, I've got the clips, the video.
[02:34:02.110 --> 02:34:02.690]  It's totally insane.
[02:34:04.040 --> 02:34:13.760]  Yeah, and Nikola Tesla came up with ball lightning technology, which could burn through bunkers and solid walls and bedrock and can be guided.
[02:34:13.860 --> 02:34:16.040]  He was super interested in ball lightning.
[02:34:16.239 --> 02:34:17.440]  It's a natural phenomenon.
[02:34:17.440 --> 02:34:20.139]  If you look up on YouTube, there's tons of videos of it.
[02:34:22.469 --> 02:34:31.569]  Part of it, I think they could use Bluebeam and be like, oh, Russia was annihilated by aliens or a meteorite strike or whatever, and we've got to go under lockdown.
[02:34:31.809 --> 02:34:36.530]  Yeah, I mean, make no mistake, the Air Force is like, hundreds of drones fly over our nuclear weapons every week.
[02:34:36.549 --> 02:34:40.270]  We don't know what they are, and they're just showing Russia all this stuff.
[02:34:41.989 --> 02:34:49.829]  And it's also part of just the brinksmanship between two great superpowers with their technology using Ukraine as a proving ground.
[02:34:50.010 --> 02:35:13.809]  I'm sure they're not only doing all this missile tech research and ground forces tank research, but also the space-based weapons and I think even the quantum entanglement Time travel technology where they're able to predict strikes and look into the future and transmit data from the future to the past,
[02:35:14.170 --> 02:35:15.629]  both U.S. and Russia.
[02:35:15.770 --> 02:35:16.270]  What do you think?
[02:35:17.149 --> 02:35:25.850]  Yeah, that's a little more theoretical and esoteric, but there's definitely all sorts of systems with different propulsion systems flying around.
[02:35:26.370 --> 02:35:27.629]  I appreciate your call.
[02:35:27.750 --> 02:35:28.250]  Great points.
[02:35:29.170 --> 02:35:30.909]  Ty in Arkansas, you're on the air.
[02:35:30.989 --> 02:35:31.290]  Go ahead.
[02:35:32.579 --> 02:35:33.219]  Hello, sir.
[02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:36.180]  I just kind of wanted to bring you back to the World War III topic.
[02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:39.959]  If Trump and Elon can be heroes, that's great.
[02:35:40.079 --> 02:35:44.500]  But at the same time, like you were saying, we slept 60 days with Joe Biden at the helm.
[02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:54.860]  Is there any way that Mike Johnson Well, yeah, that would be called a coup.
[02:35:55.159 --> 02:35:57.040]  I mean, the Constitution has everything there.
[02:35:57.159 --> 02:35:58.340]  It's a master document.
[02:35:59.819 --> 02:36:03.260]  They just impeach Biden, and that doesn't mean Kamala goes in.
[02:36:04.159 --> 02:36:05.780]  Or you can do the 25th Amendment.
[02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:08.719]  And then Congress is in control.
[02:36:08.979 --> 02:36:12.459]  And then Congress declares it's a lame duck.
[02:36:12.700 --> 02:36:14.139]  They've been defeated in the landslide.
[02:36:14.379 --> 02:36:16.299]  And we don't know who's in charge.
[02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:18.239]  And we have a fast trial.
[02:36:18.680 --> 02:36:22.299]  And they appointed her, the nominee, with not one vote.
[02:36:22.620 --> 02:36:27.540]  And so they're illegitimate and they're too dangerous because we don't know who's even giving the orders to bomb Russia.
[02:36:27.799 --> 02:36:30.000]  And then that's how Congress removes them.
[02:36:32.260 --> 02:36:33.399]  Do you see that happening?
[02:36:35.959 --> 02:36:38.799]  If we put enough pressure on them, I mean, we're here talking about it.
[02:36:39.239 --> 02:36:41.799]  We've got prominent members of Congress calling for it.
[02:36:42.459 --> 02:36:47.760]  I mean, it just scares me because I know that there's a lot of stuff going on the Hill with, you know, the bathroom situation.
[02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:48.780]  But like, this is serious.
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:51.899]  I mean, I'm from, y'all told me to say where I'm from.
[02:36:52.100 --> 02:36:55.020]  Fetterman says that the Republicans can poop in his potty.
[02:36:55.139 --> 02:36:57.920]  I mean, it's all, that'd be interesting to talk about on air.
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:36:58.780]  It's all ridiculous.
[02:36:58.780 --> 02:36:59.639]  I appreciate your call.
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:01.139]  And that's what they do.
[02:37:03.420 --> 02:37:04.459]  Yeah, this is not...
[02:37:04.459 --> 02:37:05.559]  We're not talking about Fetterman.
[02:37:05.639 --> 02:37:06.719]  You can use my potty.
[02:37:07.739 --> 02:37:09.719]  And, you know, colleges everywhere.
[02:37:09.979 --> 02:37:11.760]  Oh, somebody had a pot constitution on campus.
[02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:12.579]  Don't worry.
[02:37:12.639 --> 02:37:13.459]  Come in the dean's office.
[02:37:13.459 --> 02:37:15.540]  We have foot-high tables in Play-Doh and...
[02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:18.930]  Pipe cleaners so you can play with blocks.
[02:37:19.530 --> 02:37:26.989]  And then they had Play-Doh and blocks at universities all over the country, including University of Texas in San Antonio when Trump won.
[02:37:27.489 --> 02:37:29.530]  They said, oh, come play with Play-Doh.
[02:37:29.649 --> 02:37:30.729]  And we have puppies.
[02:37:30.750 --> 02:37:31.809]  We know you're sad.
[02:37:32.010 --> 02:37:33.010]  And then people go, yeah.
[02:37:33.569 --> 02:37:35.590]  And if you think that's a joke, I can play the newscast.
[02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:39.930]  And all over the country, oh my God, Charlie Kirk was here speaking today.
[02:37:39.930 --> 02:37:40.489]  I'm scared.
[02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:42.170]  Come, we've got Play-Doh for you.
[02:37:42.250 --> 02:37:43.450]  And they sit and play with Play-Doh.
[02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:46.290]  And Fetterman says, you can poop in my potty.
[02:37:47.959 --> 02:37:48.920]  That's the leftist.
[02:37:50.379 --> 02:37:51.920]  That's the three-year-old level they are.
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:57.540]  People get into being a victim and, oh, poor me, I need any depressants and all this crap.
[02:37:58.420 --> 02:37:59.940]  You're meant to take on the challenges.
[02:38:00.079 --> 02:38:00.799]  You're meant to be strong.
[02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:16.760]  Oh, if you're a new listener and you didn't know about this, it's been going on for at least 15 years, but now every major university, public and private, has de-stressing rooms where you sit like a child and play with Play-Doh and blocks and They put out alerts.
[02:38:16.940 --> 02:38:17.500]  Oh, my God.
[02:38:18.780 --> 02:38:19.579]  Oh, my God.
[02:38:19.799 --> 02:38:20.979]  Alex Jones was on campus.
[02:38:21.399 --> 02:38:22.940]  This happened down at...
[02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:24.799]  It used to be Southwest State.
[02:38:24.879 --> 02:38:25.500]  What's its name now?
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:26.620]  It's been changed for like 10 years.
[02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:29.139]  They had a little alert.
[02:38:30.319 --> 02:38:31.299]  And I wasn't even there.
[02:38:31.399 --> 02:38:32.120]  It was like a false...
[02:38:32.120 --> 02:38:32.459]  Oh, my God.
[02:38:32.540 --> 02:38:34.260]  Alex Jones was saying, don't worry, there's Play-Doh.
[02:38:34.379 --> 02:38:34.760]  Come on.
[02:38:35.100 --> 02:38:35.860]  Puppies are coming.
[02:38:36.579 --> 02:38:37.559]  Play-Doh puppies.
[02:38:37.860 --> 02:38:39.180]  It's just like...
[02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:42.799]  Meanwhile, UFO orbs are flying around at Mach 7.
[02:38:45.719 --> 02:38:47.399]  The left's like, we love seed oil.
[02:38:47.959 --> 02:38:50.239]  And we love atrazine.
[02:38:50.299 --> 02:38:50.979]  I've got articles available.
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:52.440]  We want to keep atrazine in.
[02:38:52.500 --> 02:38:53.780]  We want atrazine in the water.
[02:38:54.200 --> 02:38:55.180]  We love cancer.
[02:38:55.319 --> 02:38:56.260]  We love being sterilized.
[02:38:57.440 --> 02:38:58.360]  We love Pfizer.
[02:38:59.479 --> 02:39:05.940]  We love Rachel Maddow getting $89,000 a day for over a year to say, if you take the shot, you can't get COVID, you can't spread it.
[02:39:05.979 --> 02:39:06.840]  We love being lied to.
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:09.799]  We love Klaus Schwab.
[02:39:09.879 --> 02:39:10.459]  We love Bill Gates.
[02:39:10.500 --> 02:39:11.079]  He's our mommy.
[02:39:11.139 --> 02:39:11.760]  He's our daddy.
[02:39:12.420 --> 02:39:13.719]  He wipes our poopy back.
[02:39:15.620 --> 02:39:17.340]  And then Joe Biden's like, my butt's been wiped.
[02:39:17.420 --> 02:39:17.979]  My butt's been wiped.
[02:39:18.079 --> 02:39:20.159]  I mean, these are like mentally ill demons.
[02:39:20.819 --> 02:39:21.799]  It's not like that.
[02:39:21.879 --> 02:39:22.200]  They are.
[02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:29.540]  And the demons, the spirit loves to see us debased down into like Play-Doh and poopy pants stuff.
[02:39:31.459 --> 02:39:34.420]  Because that sounds weak and dumb, but no, that's quite the attack, isn't it?
[02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:35.239]  Just be helpless.
[02:39:35.479 --> 02:39:37.219]  Oh, don't talk bad about me.
[02:39:37.280 --> 02:39:37.959]  Don't say I'm racist.
[02:39:38.100 --> 02:39:38.659]  I'll do whatever you say.
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:39.979]  Oh, you have a puppy for me?
[02:39:41.459 --> 02:39:42.440]  Oh, you're weak.
[02:39:42.559 --> 02:39:43.139]  You're pathetic.
[02:39:43.139 --> 02:39:43.920]  You're stupid.
[02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:46.940]  Did you guys ever find the Oklahoma City video I wanted?
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:51.260]  What'd you say?
[02:39:53.500 --> 02:39:53.860]  Great.
[02:39:54.319 --> 02:39:57.780]  I sent you another video that Elon Musk posted today.
[02:39:57.879 --> 02:39:59.440]  I got in here late, didn't read the list.
[02:40:00.280 --> 02:40:07.399]  It's the one where she reads from Alexander DeTocqueville's 240-year-old book about how he predicted tyranny would take over America and looked into the future.
[02:40:09.420 --> 02:40:10.479]  You can't find it.
[02:40:10.620 --> 02:40:12.100]  It's on my X. I posted it.
[02:40:12.139 --> 02:40:12.959]  It's an Elon Musk post.
[02:40:14.780 --> 02:40:16.780]  I've read de Tugful's book a couple times.
[02:40:16.940 --> 02:40:17.579]  It's been decades.
[02:40:17.700 --> 02:40:18.260]  Let's read it again.
[02:40:18.500 --> 02:40:19.440]  He was a French historian.
[02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:23.760]  I mean, I would really call him an anthropologist, but they didn't have that term then.
[02:40:24.159 --> 02:40:26.760]  And he predicted America would be the model of the world.
[02:40:26.819 --> 02:40:28.100]  He came here right after the Revolutionary War.
[02:40:28.420 --> 02:40:31.360]  But he said, I see how the tyrants would take this over, though.
[02:40:31.579 --> 02:40:33.420]  And he predicted a nanny state.
[02:40:36.860 --> 02:40:39.260]  That's the type of brains God gives us.
[02:40:39.379 --> 02:40:40.500]  People like Alexander de Tugful.
[02:40:42.979 --> 02:40:44.139]  To see into the future.
[02:40:46.829 --> 02:40:48.309]  And that's what it is.
[02:40:48.729 --> 02:40:53.329]  Oh my gosh, a conservative came and spoke about free speech.
[02:40:54.149 --> 02:40:56.530]  Come to the dean's office and cry.
[02:40:57.590 --> 02:41:01.590]  Oh, you're in the sixth grade, you identify as a cat?
[02:41:01.989 --> 02:41:04.809]  Here, here's a cat box for you to crap in.
[02:41:09.190 --> 02:41:09.790]  Yep.
[02:41:12.630 --> 02:41:17.389]  I'm going to go back to Kat, Chris, everybody else when we come back.
[02:41:18.629 --> 02:41:20.909]  I'm going to play this Tugful video coming up as well.
[02:41:21.469 --> 02:41:31.329]  But please remember, the globalist of all the TV shows and all the documentary filmmakers and all the people on there who are awesome, who are patriots, pro-human.
[02:41:33.970 --> 02:41:39.430]  We're good to go.
[02:41:39.430 --> 02:41:46.729]  We're good to go.
[02:42:01.250 --> 02:42:13.729]  And they hate it when you go there and get the Patriot gear and the amazing superfood, Ultimate CMOS, Irish CMOS. They hate it because we keep fighting and fighting and never giving up and gaining ground.
[02:42:13.930 --> 02:42:14.670]  They're losing.
[02:42:16.590 --> 02:42:18.030]  They're having the problems.
[02:42:18.989 --> 02:42:21.530]  They're running up against the resistance.
[02:42:21.790 --> 02:42:24.090]  They're running up against the people.
[02:42:26.090 --> 02:42:27.750]  So go to the yellowstonestore.com.
[02:42:27.889 --> 02:42:29.510]  Let me tell you what Ultimate Seamoss does.
[02:42:29.690 --> 02:42:31.909]  This is a private label on the top brands of the country, these superfoods.
[02:42:32.270 --> 02:42:47.930]  Iris Seamoss, rich in nutrients, 92 of the 102 essential minerals, boost immune system, packed with antioxidants and antiviral properties, supports digestive health, enhances skin health, promotes thyroid function,
[02:42:48.370 --> 02:43:03.790]  aids weight management, improves energy levels, supports respiratory health, The Bladder Rack Concentrate, thyroid support, anti-inflammatory, digestive aid, rich antioxidants, skin health, weight management,
[02:43:03.989 --> 02:43:05.870]  joint support, improves vision.
[02:43:06.170 --> 02:43:17.829]  The Burdock Root Concentrate detoxifies the body, rich in antioxidants, improves skin health, supports digestive health, boosts immune function, balances blood sugar, anti-inflammatory, supports circulation.
[02:43:18.209 --> 02:43:22.850]  Get Ultimate CMOS at theallumshownstore.com and keep us on the air.
[02:43:23.430 --> 02:43:38.510]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, InfoWars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[02:43:38.729 --> 02:43:44.049]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public, and people can just put in one bid.
[02:43:44.889 --> 02:43:47.909]  And then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[02:43:48.389 --> 02:43:52.270]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might tell you tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:52.909]  Who knows?
[02:43:53.450 --> 02:43:55.889]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[02:43:56.209 --> 02:44:10.549]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved, filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty, having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and when they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[02:44:11.049 --> 02:44:14.950]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at InfoWars.
[02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:27.709]  But regardless, our great sponsors at TheAlexJonesStore.com with incredible supplements and amazing Patriot gear have been helping us continue to stay on air and prepare to launch The Alex Jones Network.
[02:44:28.229 --> 02:44:42.750]  We're good to go.
[02:44:44.549 --> 02:44:48.350]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in.
[02:44:48.450 --> 02:44:49.670]  But that's going to get announced.
[02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:51.870]  The winner here in just a few days.
[02:44:52.030 --> 02:44:56.090]  And regardless of whether InfoWars is on the air or not, the Alex Jones Network will be on air.
[02:44:56.190 --> 02:44:57.729]  And so you'll see the winner, the announcement.
[02:44:57.909 --> 02:44:59.590]  We're going to invite them to Austin and so much more.
[02:44:59.790 --> 02:45:00.670]  So now...
[02:45:01.069 --> 02:45:08.750]  We were going to do this in a few weeks, but now our great sponsor is doing it early because we're calling it the Darkest Hour giveaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:45:09.129 --> 02:45:14.649]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[02:45:14.870 --> 02:45:16.129]  I'll read over the specs in a moment.
[02:45:16.270 --> 02:45:17.270]  It's a beautiful truck.

[02:47:11.620 --> 02:47:17.040]  Now we've got to stay on air to back his agenda to make America great again and go after the deep state globalists.
[02:47:17.319 --> 02:47:18.200]  God bless you all.
[02:47:18.399 --> 02:47:19.360]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:47:19.579 --> 02:47:22.459]  Check out the new truck at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:47:25.959 --> 02:47:28.680]  Reporter, researchers, we're going to be riding a shotgun with us coming up here in a few minutes.
[02:47:28.819 --> 02:47:30.399]  We'll continue to get calls in here.
[02:47:31.620 --> 02:47:35.319]  Got a couple of clips I want to play as well, but right now let's go ahead and go to Kat in Canada.
[02:47:35.479 --> 02:47:36.860]  Thanks for calling Kat and thanks for holding.
[02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:38.559]  Oh, no problem.
[02:47:38.719 --> 02:47:38.840]  Hi.
[02:47:39.159 --> 02:47:49.700]  Okay, I want you to look into your AJ crystal ball and tell us how far Biden slash the Democrats are going to go and is it all boiled down to try to sabotage Trump?
[02:47:50.709 --> 02:47:53.129]  Well, the end part, I mean, you don't even mean to tell you that.
[02:47:54.049 --> 02:48:03.329]  100%, this is the military industrial complex flexing its muscles, creating a crisis to try to manipulate Trump into trying to stop the war.
[02:48:03.569 --> 02:48:07.729]  Then they'll say it's illegal for him to be talking to Putin, which is a total gaslight hoax.
[02:48:07.829 --> 02:48:09.149]  That's his job as president-elect.
[02:48:10.239 --> 02:48:17.840]  Then if they can get the war and control its expansion, they think it'll get so out of hand that Trump will have trouble ending it.
[02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:21.440]  Even if it goes to full war, the globalists already want to depopulate us.
[02:48:21.479 --> 02:48:23.620]  They'd rather do that than lose power.
[02:48:23.700 --> 02:48:25.200]  They'd rather have nuclear war than go to prison.
[02:48:27.399 --> 02:48:34.899]  Do you think they're actually going to go that far as to start some type of proxy world war type before he gets in?
[02:48:36.219 --> 02:48:36.920]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:48:37.139 --> 02:48:39.940]  But I was answering the end part of your question first.
[02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:41.120]  Let me answer the first part.
[02:48:43.020 --> 02:48:51.639]  If the globalists know that we're aware of their plan to start World War III, and they're trying to sleepwalk us into it, and there's enough pressure politically...
[02:48:53.079 --> 02:48:54.280]  Then they'll back off.
[02:48:54.399 --> 02:48:57.340]  We beat them in the election and overrode their fraud.
[02:48:57.819 --> 02:48:58.920]  We can do it again here.
[02:48:59.040 --> 02:48:59.540]  We need to pray.
[02:48:59.799 --> 02:49:01.219]  We need to understand what's happening.
[02:49:01.620 --> 02:49:04.100]  We need to promote Trump stopping it.
[02:49:04.239 --> 02:49:05.940]  We need to call for Zelensky to stop it.
[02:49:06.020 --> 02:49:10.299]  I've called for Putin to call for a ceasefire that will not make him look weak.
[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:13.700]  I don't think he'll do that because I understand the mindset.
[02:49:14.879 --> 02:49:17.260]  And also that he can be removed by hardliners if he doesn't.
[02:49:17.459 --> 02:49:18.719]  It's deteriorating quickly.
[02:49:19.550 --> 02:49:24.069]  So yeah, you bet your bottom dollar, the globalists, think they can survive a nuclear war.
[02:49:25.069 --> 02:49:28.270]  And so that's how serious this is, in my opinion.
[02:49:28.590 --> 02:49:28.829]  Go ahead.
[02:49:29.989 --> 02:49:32.930]  Yeah, that's exactly what I think, too.
[02:49:33.010 --> 02:49:39.389]  I think they're trying to push Putin into doing something so they can turn around and blame him for what they're going to do.
[02:49:39.549 --> 02:49:54.850]  Oh, that's the other point that I've made and Naomi Wolf made yesterday, is if Putin does a ceasefire before Trump gets in, or even after he does, It's definitely on the menu and at the top of the menu for them to stage a false flag, even a nuclear one,
[02:49:54.889 --> 02:49:55.610]  and say Putin did it.
[02:49:55.750 --> 02:49:59.590]  So the old globalist empire is coming to an end.
[02:49:59.750 --> 02:50:03.790]  When empires start to fall, they always start a giant spasmodic death row war.
[02:50:04.190 --> 02:50:08.430]  And now there's nuclear weapons, so that changes the equation of history.
[02:50:09.190 --> 02:50:10.809]  So we're not just talking about the end of history.
[02:50:11.719 --> 02:50:22.540]  That the globalists wanted, meaning they totally take over and brainwash and poison everybody and depopulate everybody and bring in the new 2.0 Uber mention, delusional, you know, transhumanist crap.
[02:50:23.079 --> 02:50:32.100]  But they could blow up the surface of the planet, so the end of civilization as we know it, there might be some survivors down the road, but who knows if civilization would ever rebuild.
[02:50:33.139 --> 02:50:39.559]  The radiation alone from the reactors melting down, it's not the nukes you've got to worry about, would...
[02:50:41.579 --> 02:50:50.459]  Definitely mutated so bad we would not be recognizable, the survivors and their offspring, their progeny from what we are.
[02:50:50.600 --> 02:50:56.120]  So if you think we're falling now, boy, it'll be quite the mutant world for those that survive.
[02:50:57.219 --> 02:51:01.379]  Yeah, I think they're just wailing right now, and I think they're going to try anything.
[02:51:01.379 --> 02:51:02.940]  I think everyone should be prepared.
[02:51:03.739 --> 02:51:04.680]  Oh, I don't think.
[02:51:04.840 --> 02:51:05.399]  You're right.
[02:51:05.520 --> 02:51:07.540]  I mean, they've lit the fuse.
[02:51:07.719 --> 02:51:10.719]  We're in the first phase of a full world war.
[02:51:11.020 --> 02:51:12.819]  I said yesterday World War III has begun.
[02:51:13.100 --> 02:51:20.159]  The only question is, will it become a thermonuclear World War III? And can we reverse engines here?
[02:51:20.340 --> 02:51:21.579]  Can we back out of this?
[02:51:21.700 --> 02:51:22.520]  And there's still time.
[02:51:22.780 --> 02:51:23.479]  That's definite.
[02:51:23.680 --> 02:51:27.180]  But time is the destroyer.
[02:51:27.719 --> 02:51:32.219]  And I forget the poet that said it, but God sends...
[02:51:33.989 --> 02:51:36.510]  Madness to civilizations he wishes to judge.
[02:51:36.989 --> 02:51:38.409]  There's another permutation of it.
[02:51:39.049 --> 02:51:40.190]  People said different ways.
[02:51:40.350 --> 02:51:45.549]  But God sends insane evil leaders to those he wishes to judge.
[02:51:45.729 --> 02:51:46.950]  And I think we've got both, don't we?
[02:51:48.530 --> 02:51:48.790]  All right.
[02:51:48.889 --> 02:51:49.250]  Thank you.
[02:51:49.430 --> 02:51:49.950]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:51:50.110 --> 02:51:50.469]  I love you.
[02:51:50.649 --> 02:51:51.309]  Love you too, Kat.
[02:51:51.950 --> 02:51:53.030]  I love all of you.
[02:51:53.229 --> 02:51:53.610]  All right.
[02:51:54.270 --> 02:51:55.389]  Nick Sordor coming up.
[02:51:55.489 --> 02:51:57.110]  More calls, tons of news and clips.
[02:51:57.489 --> 02:51:59.729]  We're now well into hour number four.
[02:51:59.889 --> 02:52:05.709]  Please follow me on the backup at AJNLive on X. The coordinates, the Alex Jones Network at AJNLive.
[02:52:06.229 --> 02:52:20.750]  Alright, we're now into hour number four and the mighty Nick Sordor, an amazing journalist and reporter reaching hundreds of millions a week on X. Nick Sordor, S-O-R-T-O-R on X. I want to get his take on World War III, the Trump election.
[02:52:21.430 --> 02:52:26.350]  Matt Gaetz pulling his bid to be the Attorney General because he had to pass Senate confirmation.
[02:52:27.489 --> 02:52:28.889]  And so much more.
[02:52:29.350 --> 02:52:32.090]  In a moment, we'll intersperse a few of the callers that are left here.
[02:52:32.469 --> 02:52:36.370]  They've been limited callers, but the ones that we're going to have time to get to, Brett, Colby, and Terry.
[02:52:36.469 --> 02:52:44.930]  But since I mentioned it, Here is a woman that Elon Musk posted reading from one of Alexander de Tocqueville's books about America.
[02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:49.649]  He spent a decade here or so after the revolutionary war and said, this is the future.
[02:52:49.809 --> 02:52:51.270]  This idea will take over the world.
[02:52:51.389 --> 02:52:58.370]  But he also wrote about how he saw tyranny might infect us in the future, especially because liberty would produce so much wealth.
[02:52:58.569 --> 02:52:59.709]  What would happen?
[02:52:59.930 --> 02:53:03.329]  Here's what Alexander de Tocqueville predicted 240 years ago.
[02:53:04.030 --> 02:53:20.969]  We know that already back in 1840, French philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville very accurately predicted and described in his book Democracy in America what type of tyranny a modern population like the American one had to be fearful of.
[02:53:21.290 --> 02:53:36.170]  Because as Tocqueville predicted, tyranny in a modern democratic society like America would look very different from the types of tyranny that European nations had faced up until then in aristocratic societies, for example.
[02:53:36.930 --> 02:53:37.629]  Let me quote.
[02:53:37.850 --> 02:53:49.770]  It covers the service of society with a network of small, complicated rules, through which the most original minds and the most energetic characters cannot penetrate to rise above the crowds.
[02:53:50.049 --> 02:53:54.450]  The will of man is not shattered, but softened, bent, and guided.
[02:53:55.139 --> 02:53:59.620]  Men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are constantly restrained from acting.
[02:53:59.920 --> 02:54:03.860]  Such a power does not destroy, but it prevents existence.
[02:54:04.159 --> 02:54:19.040]  It does not tyrannize, but it compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.
[02:54:19.760 --> 02:54:33.680]  Well, if that is not an accurate description of what actually ended up happening, not just to America, but to all modern democratic societies who have turned into absolute bureaucratic nightmares, then I don't know what is.
[02:54:34.360 --> 02:54:49.920]  TalkFuel was absolutely right, and that's why I'm so excited and happy to congratulate Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk on their appointments as the leader of the DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, Because for the first time in American history,
[02:54:50.459 --> 02:54:58.719]  now actively, there will be a government organization working against this type of tyranny that Tocqueville warned about.
[02:55:00.700 --> 02:55:04.719]  And I thought, he's written a couple books on the U.S. I haven't read them in decades.
[02:55:04.719 --> 02:55:06.120]  I don't remember the exact names.
[02:55:06.280 --> 02:55:10.280]  I think he wrote his first one like in the 1820s, but they say that's the 40s.
[02:55:11.159 --> 02:55:12.540]  Regardless, everybody should read them again.
[02:55:13.059 --> 02:55:27.040]  I wanted to get Nick Sordor on because he's been having amazing coverage of the election of Trump, what's happening, these appointments where he sees that going, the escalation to insane levels, unprecedented levels towards World War III and nuclear war.
[02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:29.840]  I wanted him to ride shotgun with us here.
[02:55:31.229 --> 02:55:33.530]  Towards the end of the hour, I have to finish up with some calls and play some more clips.
[02:55:33.629 --> 02:55:35.409]  I'm going to let him host a little bit here.
[02:55:36.290 --> 02:55:40.489]  But, Nick, wow, what a crazy time to be alive.
[02:55:40.590 --> 02:55:42.030]  Anybody saying they're bored?
[02:55:42.510 --> 02:55:44.670]  Well, that's because they're watching Netflix for the NFL all day.
[02:55:44.770 --> 02:55:46.549]  The real world is wild, my friend.
[02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:51.829]  Yeah, if you can actually connect to Netflix to be able to watch the NFL, then maybe that's what you're doing.
[02:55:51.989 --> 02:55:58.180]  But anyway, you know, I'm telling you, man, I keep telling people, If I'm dreaming, don't wake me up.
[02:55:58.299 --> 02:56:04.100]  I mean, this is exactly what you especially have been fighting for for so many years now.
[02:56:04.100 --> 02:56:09.260]  But you're seeing the deep state still has power that we have to usurp from them.
[02:56:09.719 --> 02:56:34.030]  The establishment, the people that want to leave things as they are, that like the idea of the government having fully unchecked power over the people and wielding that power, like the senators in Congress or the Republicans in the Senate today that Successfully took down Matt Gaetz using this BS Me Too smear campaign that I'm sure we'll talk a lot about later.
[02:56:34.209 --> 02:56:38.469]  But it's crazy, Alex, you know what they're doing to you.
[02:56:38.690 --> 02:56:40.129]  You are the best example.
[02:56:40.270 --> 02:56:42.989]  And I'm so happy to see you keep fighting here.
[02:56:43.110 --> 02:56:45.409]  You're still InfoWars is still live.
[02:56:45.409 --> 02:56:47.469]  You are taking it to the end.
[02:56:47.629 --> 02:56:49.510]  And I super respect that, Alex.
[02:56:49.649 --> 02:56:51.110]  Thank you so much for doing that for us.
[02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:55.979]  Yeah, I mean, I wanted to talk about Russia, World War III, Elon Musk.
[02:56:56.200 --> 02:57:04.579]  We have confirmed that Trump and Elon Musk are behind the scenes talking to Zelensky and Putin, trying to get a ceasefire the next 59 days until Trump gets in.
[02:57:04.719 --> 02:57:09.979]  Clearly, the deep state is trying to start World War III, and we're already in the first stages of it that leads to a nuclear war.
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:11.280]  But I guess...
[02:57:11.690 --> 02:57:12.709]  I mean, it is newsworthy.
[02:57:12.829 --> 02:57:15.229]  If this was happening to anybody else, I'd be covering it.
[02:57:15.389 --> 02:57:21.629]  The second attempt by the Justice Department since May 31st to close us without a court order, the judge saying they couldn't.
[02:57:21.690 --> 02:57:24.149]  We were back in the building in less than 24 hours.
[02:57:25.069 --> 02:57:27.129]  And The Onion announcing they're the owner.
[02:57:27.329 --> 02:57:38.649]  And then Everytown, the new name of the big Democrat, Violence Policy Center, Brady Merger, that's been behind the fake lawsuits and rigged court cases against me, out in the open saying we're the ones behind it, celebrating.
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:41.559]  And they're not laughing now.
[02:57:41.700 --> 02:57:43.879]  There's a status hearing Monday.
[02:57:44.219 --> 02:57:45.659]  But the judge...
[02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:52.459]  A signal that he said he wants a full day hearing, probably sometime after Thanksgiving.
[02:57:52.780 --> 02:57:54.600]  I mean, do they have egg on their face?
[02:57:54.680 --> 02:57:55.979]  But I'm not arrogant about this.
[02:57:56.299 --> 02:58:00.780]  I said to the crew, I said I would expect a lot of attacks.
[02:58:00.780 --> 02:58:03.600]  And I don't just mean in the legal area.
[02:58:03.799 --> 02:58:05.639]  But I said look for hack attacks.
[02:58:06.340 --> 02:58:07.760]  Look for other stuff.
[02:58:08.459 --> 02:58:10.819]  And then I learned that we got hacked two days ago.
[02:58:10.940 --> 02:58:12.579]  I haven't announced the details of that yet.
[02:58:13.200 --> 02:58:13.680]  But...
[02:58:14.209 --> 02:58:17.110]  It's really funny that the feds are in the building and that happens.
[02:58:17.370 --> 02:58:18.930]  I'm sure they had nothing to do with it.
[02:58:19.030 --> 02:58:21.610]  They would just stage a fake auction and all the rest of it.
[02:58:21.690 --> 02:58:26.489]  But my lawyers, who are very respected bankruptcy lawyers, very well-known names if you look them up, folks.
[02:58:27.049 --> 02:58:30.549]  I mean, one of these guys is like, you know, known.
[02:58:30.629 --> 02:58:36.450]  I mean, it wins like huge national cases against TMZ. You name it, it represents...
[02:58:36.959 --> 02:58:38.819]  Movie stars, Dallas Cowboys, everybody.
[02:58:39.280 --> 02:58:42.579]  He only takes the cases he wants, and he heard about this.
[02:58:43.299 --> 02:58:47.239]  And he's going to do a whole presentation in the next few days here.
[02:58:47.319 --> 02:58:48.040]  I'll leave it at that.
[02:58:48.200 --> 02:58:50.200]  On air with us, Ben Brooks.
[02:58:50.799 --> 02:58:53.459]  And they are crapping bricks right now.
[02:58:53.659 --> 02:58:58.620]  And I'm not going to say exactly what the lawyers are saying, but they're saying basically...
[02:58:59.940 --> 02:59:00.700]  Here's a quote.
[02:59:00.899 --> 02:59:03.500]  The judge's head is going to explode.
[02:59:04.479 --> 02:59:13.799]  The arrogance, I don't mean we're going to blow it up, but that's the quote, when he's already reading the lawsuits, the filings we did, it's their own documents.
[02:59:13.959 --> 02:59:21.180]  They memorialized the rigging and all of it and said, well, it's okay because I'm the federal trustee.
[02:59:21.479 --> 02:59:25.159]  No, the judge said in the hearing last Thursday, you didn't have my authorization for any of this.
[02:59:26.720 --> 02:59:32.719]  So, and what's crazy is, they're just hiding it in plain view.
[02:59:32.799 --> 02:59:36.219]  And they literally said on Good Morning America, when Stephanopoulos said, how did a lower bid win?
[02:59:36.440 --> 02:59:38.600]  And he said, well, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:40.299 --> 02:59:41.959]  So, you know, it's open season.
[02:59:42.139 --> 02:59:43.520]  I mean, you know, it's Donald Trump.
[02:59:44.040 --> 02:59:45.000]  Your take on this.
[02:59:45.760 --> 02:59:53.659]  But, you know, Alex, I think the American people at this point, especially people that are paying attention, people on X, they see what's happening to you.
[02:59:53.760 --> 02:59:55.299]  They know this is an entire charade.
[02:59:55.399 --> 03:00:01.540]  And the federal government, the Biden Department of Justice, picked the wrong person to try to make an example out of.
[03:00:01.680 --> 03:00:03.360]  Because you're not just going to roll over.
[03:00:03.540 --> 03:00:06.379]  You know, a lot of people are terrified about what's going to happen to them.
[03:00:06.379 --> 03:00:19.639]  And you are an inspiration to To people to show what happens when you put up a fight, when you don't let them nail you into the ground like they think they were going to be doing so easily.
[03:00:19.639 --> 03:00:32.139]  I mean, you've spent years, years fighting back against these people, and I have not seen more proof than what happened last week to you that this is a massive witch hunt.
[03:00:32.280 --> 03:00:33.520]  It's crazy.
[03:00:33.739 --> 03:00:38.020]  I mean, the next day, you were back in the studio after they disconnected you.
[03:00:38.260 --> 03:00:40.450]  It Because it was illegal.
[03:00:40.629 --> 03:00:42.389]  What they did was totally illegal.
[03:00:42.610 --> 03:00:48.209]  They exposed themselves last week, and I don't think there's any coming back from that.
[03:00:48.409 --> 03:00:51.889]  I think at this point, you know, they're going to have to back down from you.
[03:00:52.010 --> 03:00:58.850]  And I mean, they're definitely going to when Trump finally gets back into office and can put an end to all of these ridiculous witch hunts.
[03:00:59.430 --> 03:01:05.659]  But You know, you were talking a little bit earlier about what's going on with Joe Biden and such.
[03:01:05.920 --> 03:01:08.559]  It seems to me...
[03:01:08.559 --> 03:01:16.799]  Okay, you're going to give Ukraine the ability to launch long-range missiles into Russian territory right before...
[03:01:16.799 --> 03:01:19.219]  And let's be clear, Ukraine can't run those missiles.
[03:01:19.840 --> 03:01:20.399]  Okay?
[03:01:20.879 --> 03:01:23.139]  All these big countries have their own...
[03:01:23.139 --> 03:01:24.680]  American-trained operatives?
[03:01:24.860 --> 03:01:25.780]  Well, let me explain.
[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:29.860]  Each country, because it's part of their military industrial complex, has their own missiles.
[03:01:30.020 --> 03:01:31.840]  So they have a bunch of different ones.
[03:01:32.159 --> 03:01:33.459]  They're all in the same class.
[03:01:33.620 --> 03:01:38.180]  The attackums, the storm shadows, the Germans have theirs, the French have theirs.
[03:01:38.760 --> 03:01:39.979]  They're all similar class.
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:41.079]  They can all carry nuclear weapons.
[03:01:41.079 --> 03:01:42.139]  They're a sneak attack weapon.
[03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:45.520]  You use them conventionally against troops, but they're seen as too expensive for that.
[03:01:45.600 --> 03:01:51.860]  Their main mission is to get up close and sneak attack with hydrogen bombs to take out Russia's nuclear weapons.
[03:01:52.920 --> 03:01:58.280]  Strategic bomber fleet, their missile fields, and their cruise missile launchers.
[03:01:58.719 --> 03:02:04.440]  And so Russia said, if you move these even up to our border, we're at war with you, much less attack with them.
[03:02:04.620 --> 03:02:09.239]  So that's why, and yes, these missiles, the Germans don't know how to run our missiles.
[03:02:09.500 --> 03:02:10.540]  The French don't know.
[03:02:10.680 --> 03:02:11.719]  We don't know how to run theirs.
[03:02:12.020 --> 03:02:15.739]  These are people that trained for at least five years.
[03:02:17.079 --> 03:02:18.899]  And there's satellite control.
[03:02:20.459 --> 03:02:22.760]  So, no.
[03:02:23.120 --> 03:02:25.020]  Basically, rocket scientists run these.
[03:02:25.180 --> 03:02:30.180]  They can also be remote controlled by the defense agencies.
[03:02:30.479 --> 03:02:31.159]  So, no.
[03:02:31.420 --> 03:02:33.319]  Ukraine is not running these missiles.
[03:02:33.420 --> 03:02:34.520]  That's 100% on record.
[03:02:34.559 --> 03:02:34.840]  Go ahead.
[03:02:36.290 --> 03:02:40.790]  Yeah, and so what does Biden expect to happen at this point?
[03:02:41.030 --> 03:02:50.670]  You know, we know that launching into Russian territory, killing Russians, all that's going to do is be—it's going to escalate the conflict.
[03:02:50.850 --> 03:02:51.770]  He knows that.
[03:02:51.909 --> 03:02:55.129]  Yes, he's pretty—you know, he doesn't have his wits anymore.
[03:02:55.129 --> 03:03:00.489]  I mean, he's got the— IQ of my, you know, AirPods right here.
[03:03:00.610 --> 03:03:03.909]  I mean, it's really, it's pretty sad, but he knows enough.
[03:03:03.909 --> 03:03:06.590]  He's been around long enough to know what he's doing.
[03:03:06.729 --> 03:03:08.549]  He knows that he's trying to escalate this.
[03:03:08.750 --> 03:03:10.850]  The question is, why, Alex?
[03:03:11.010 --> 03:03:15.090]  Why is he trying to launch World War III right before he leaves office?
[03:03:16.030 --> 03:03:16.850]  What's the point?
[03:03:17.069 --> 03:03:29.370]  Well, at the base level, they, he just authorized this 4.65 billion, 4 billion, 650 million, Loan, they're now saying that's forgiven.
[03:03:30.190 --> 03:03:39.030]  The State Department said all their budget, basically, is at 94%, is now illegally, because it's all been approved by Congress, what's supposed to be spent on, is being given to Ukraine.
[03:03:39.209 --> 03:03:40.090]  That's all impeachable.
[03:03:40.930 --> 03:03:41.950]  Merrick Garland, all of them.
[03:03:42.709 --> 03:03:44.389]  And so they've all bought houses.
[03:03:44.610 --> 03:03:46.129]  They're all laundering money through it.
[03:03:46.209 --> 03:03:51.290]  So they're gorging as much money as they can into it using this escalation of the smokescreen for that.
[03:03:51.409 --> 03:03:52.610]  But that's the base level.
[03:03:53.229 --> 03:04:08.670]  It's also meant to be a big political distraction, to bare minimum hand Trump such a mess that it's hard for him to do a peace deal so the war with Ukraine can grind on forever because that's the new economic policy of the EU. And the UK is a 20-30 year war.
[03:04:08.909 --> 03:04:10.389]  That policy's been set officially.
[03:04:10.510 --> 03:04:12.250]  Macron's talked about it for at least a year and a half.
[03:04:12.940 --> 03:04:15.940]  And then the Pentagon says, don't worry, Russia's bluffing.
[03:04:15.979 --> 03:04:16.760]  Their nukes don't work.
[03:04:16.819 --> 03:04:17.600]  They don't have good missiles.
[03:04:17.799 --> 03:04:26.180]  Putin just demonstrated they can get past the missile defenses and use MIRV technology to deliver nuclear weapons if they need to.
[03:04:26.239 --> 03:04:32.639]  This was a nuclear strike simulation with a delivery system with conventional munitions in real time.
[03:04:32.639 --> 03:04:34.959]  So it's a real simulation, just not with nukes.
[03:04:35.970 --> 03:04:38.329]  And so we are definitely off to the races.
[03:04:38.489 --> 03:04:43.469]  And then Putin said at the end of his speech today, there will be more retaliation.
[03:04:44.069 --> 03:04:50.090]  And he also said, we may, if this continues to escalate, we'll do it in a mirror in proportionality.
[03:04:50.770 --> 03:04:54.489]  But if you launch a large aerospace attack, we don't know if it's not nukes.
[03:04:54.629 --> 03:04:56.129]  So we'll have to go to pure nuclear war.
[03:04:56.209 --> 03:04:58.610]  We see a whole bunch of aircraft and missiles coming in.
[03:04:58.850 --> 03:05:00.709]  Which is default for the US as well.
[03:05:01.090 --> 03:05:02.149]  It's the exact same policy we have.
[03:05:02.690 --> 03:05:06.270]  And then he also said, but we're going to hit big targets.
[03:05:06.409 --> 03:05:07.889]  We're going to warn people to leave the cities.
[03:05:08.510 --> 03:05:15.170]  Well, the strategic conventional munitions are so precise, there's no need to do that for civilians.
[03:05:15.350 --> 03:05:29.360]  So for him to say, we'll tell you zones to get out of, that was an open nuclear threat of perhaps a future weapon demonstration will be the vaporization of several hundred square miles with a smaller We're a nuclear weapon.
[03:05:31.639 --> 03:05:41.000]  Yeah, and so, you know, what do you take out of this, where the reports are coming out where Vladimir Putin said that he is willing to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine, but only with President Trump?
[03:05:41.219 --> 03:05:45.680]  You know, it seems to reaffirm a lot of the things that you've been saying over the past several years, Alex.
[03:05:45.879 --> 03:05:53.000]  It's that, you know, Joe Biden is trying to push this war, and President Trump can bring peace back to the region.
[03:05:53.139 --> 03:05:55.479]  I mean, we had no new wars under President Trump.
[03:05:55.860 --> 03:06:05.870]  You know, does this seem, you know, pretty much what you would have predicted, that That Trump coming back in office can put a stop to this war on day one?
[03:06:05.989 --> 03:06:09.110]  And if you are Trump, Alex, how would you do that?
[03:06:09.950 --> 03:06:17.350]  Well, Trump wants the investment to go to roads and bridges and factories and power production and high-tech development.
[03:06:17.690 --> 03:06:21.069]  He doesn't want it just put into the bombs and all this crap.
[03:06:21.090 --> 03:06:22.870]  He knows how existentially dangerous it is.
[03:06:22.930 --> 03:06:27.170]  So yeah, it's been admitted that Musk and Trump have been talking jointly to Zelensky.
[03:06:27.290 --> 03:06:33.069]  My information is we've not heard from Trump in three days on this because he's behind the scenes talking to Putin and Zelensky.
[03:06:33.469 --> 03:06:34.729]  And they're going to then want...
[03:06:37.639 --> 03:06:52.139]  Putin to call for a ceasefire unconditionally until Trump gets in office in 59 days so they can then have a huge historic armistice and then out of that armistice have a peace compact.
[03:06:52.600 --> 03:07:13.799]  Look, the peace through strength ideology that Trump was pushing for years I think?
[03:07:23.729 --> 03:07:28.270]  No idea what's actually going through Joe Biden's head, if anything, is going through Joe Biden's head.
[03:07:28.450 --> 03:07:33.010]  But look, they are trying to set President Trump up for failure.
[03:07:34.209 --> 03:07:43.829]  No matter the cost, it doesn't matter if it costs us American lives that are the result of World War III that come out.
[03:07:43.930 --> 03:07:46.750]  For whatever reason, they want to set Trump up for failure.
[03:07:46.909 --> 03:07:48.909]  And it's terrifying.
[03:07:48.930 --> 03:07:51.069]  And this is what we're rebuking so hard.
[03:07:51.209 --> 03:07:58.639]  We had a big win in November, but these guys won't We're good to go.
[03:08:14.280 --> 03:08:16.100]  I have high hopes for that as well.
[03:08:16.219 --> 03:08:26.819]  Unfortunately, we've already taken a defeat with Matt Gaetz not becoming the Attorney General to stop some of this stuff that's going on, like the attacks on Alex Jones, like the attacks on the J6ers.
[03:08:27.340 --> 03:08:29.260]  But we can't stop here.
[03:08:29.420 --> 03:08:32.280]  We've got a lot of work to do, especially in the U.S. Senate.
[03:08:33.159 --> 03:08:38.860]  But Biden's setting us up for World War III. The answer is, why?
[03:08:39.399 --> 03:08:41.219]  Why is he allowing this to happen?
[03:08:43.209 --> 03:08:46.209]  Well, in the final easy equation, there's many levels to it.
[03:08:46.610 --> 03:08:51.110]  Level us all together and do threat assessments and decide what helps them on all their agendas.
[03:08:51.510 --> 03:08:54.670]  Creates chaos, creates fear, distracts from all their stealing, their money laundering.
[03:08:55.010 --> 03:08:59.450]  Gives Trump a huge fiasco once he does get in 59 days, bare minimum.
[03:09:00.049 --> 03:09:07.510]  And they're willing to roll the dice that nuclear war is not going to happen because they think Putin is bluffing as they continue themselves to escalate.
[03:09:08.329 --> 03:09:09.409]  And it's real simple.
[03:09:09.549 --> 03:09:12.049]  They'd rather have a nuclear war than go to prison and lose power.
[03:09:14.090 --> 03:09:19.629]  Well, I mean, if that's their strategy, they're going to learn the hard way here in about 60 days.
[03:09:20.229 --> 03:09:28.870]  But luckily, it seems, you know, we're having a little bit, Alex, I don't know if you saw this story with FEMA coming up and finally being put on the hot seat.
[03:09:29.010 --> 03:09:30.149]  But nothing's going to be done about it.
[03:09:30.190 --> 03:09:38.989]  These people aren't going to end up going to prison unless we get an attorney general that actually has balls, that will actually make something happen.
[03:09:39.190 --> 03:09:41.610]  You know, we had a problem during the first Trump administration.
[03:09:43.110 --> 03:09:55.090]  We're good to go.
[03:10:02.329 --> 03:10:08.430]  Over the fact that they would not go, FEMA would not go, and help people that had Trump signs in their yards.
[03:10:08.610 --> 03:10:22.110]  We have been screaming that this stuff was happening, and we've been called conspiracy theorists, and I was on the ground out there in Western North Carolina, in Lahaina, Maui, when that fire happened, and in East Palestine, Ohio.
[03:10:22.450 --> 03:10:30.000]  And I've been saying this for well over a year now, but I've been blacklisted from mainstream television.
[03:10:30.780 --> 03:10:43.540]  People have been called to have me arrested for going after these politicians and bureaucrats that are lying to us and saying that they're not targeting people.
[03:10:43.579 --> 03:10:44.379]  Trump voters.
[03:10:44.559 --> 03:10:46.920]  And this is not something new here, either.
[03:10:47.239 --> 03:10:51.200]  They've been doing—the IRS was exposed years ago for doing the same thing.
[03:10:51.360 --> 03:10:56.459]  We know that they do this, and so us calling them out for it is not that far-fetched.
[03:10:56.540 --> 03:10:58.000]  I'm watching it on the ground.
[03:10:58.180 --> 03:11:04.590]  They're not helping— By the way, we all said that it got attacked.
[03:11:04.829 --> 03:11:06.530]  We had witnesses on that said it got attacked.
[03:11:06.649 --> 03:11:11.430]  And as you know, weeks ago, the FEMA manager got caught saying don't give Trump supporters help.
[03:11:11.610 --> 03:11:14.010]  Then she released the documents that they told her to do.
[03:11:14.110 --> 03:11:15.250]  It was happening all over.
[03:11:15.610 --> 03:11:19.610]  We had videos of FEMA administrators saying we're not egalitarian anymore.
[03:11:19.610 --> 03:11:20.709]  We don't help everybody.
[03:11:21.309 --> 03:11:24.010]  That's really evil to say, but they say it like it's a good thing.
[03:11:24.069 --> 03:11:26.649]  We only help LGBTQ people.
[03:11:27.170 --> 03:11:30.190]  And then now, new documents have come out.
[03:11:30.309 --> 03:11:38.790]  FEMA supervisor says they view Trump supporters as, quote, domestic terrorists with new whistleblowers.
[03:11:39.110 --> 03:11:42.270]  So they don't just say, help us, we are terrorists, Nick Sordor.
[03:11:42.450 --> 03:11:43.809]  How vindicated are we?
[03:11:44.870 --> 03:11:46.270]  We're totally vindicated.
[03:11:46.469 --> 03:11:53.850]  The district attorney down there in Asheville threatened me with arrest for even going into the area to try to help.
[03:11:53.969 --> 03:11:58.750]  We were the first ones to go down there and reconnect the region with Starlinks.
[03:11:59.489 --> 03:12:09.569]  I personally gave my own Starlinks to North Carolina state troopers so that they could communicate with each other because there was no communication down there.
[03:12:09.850 --> 03:12:13.520]  And Alex, I'll tell you, people ask me all the time, How do you know when to go into these areas?
[03:12:13.659 --> 03:12:16.360]  How do you know when there's going to be a big government cover-up?
[03:12:16.500 --> 03:12:22.459]  It's when they do things like close down the roads and say, oh, there's no access to North Carolina anymore.
[03:12:22.459 --> 03:12:22.600]  That's right.
[03:12:22.719 --> 03:12:24.680]  I mean, you're there in Springfield, Ohio.
[03:12:24.959 --> 03:12:27.100]  You're there at the train derailment.
[03:12:27.180 --> 03:12:29.139]  You're there at the Mexico-Texas border.
[03:12:29.440 --> 03:12:31.239]  You're there in North Carolina.
[03:12:31.479 --> 03:12:32.159]  You go there.
[03:12:32.280 --> 03:12:35.040]  That's what most people know you are, but you really kick ass.
[03:12:35.440 --> 03:12:39.700]  But the mainline journalists, you wonder why ABC News, CBS, CNN can't do it.
[03:12:39.840 --> 03:12:41.059]  They don't want to do it.
[03:12:41.139 --> 03:12:42.000]  They're there to lie.
[03:12:42.159 --> 03:12:44.120]  They're there to repeat what FEMA says.
[03:12:44.420 --> 03:12:52.239]  But you were there days after it happened saying FEMA is blocking aid, and it was true, and now we have the documents.
[03:12:53.020 --> 03:12:56.899]  And again, people ask, how would U.S. trustees try to shut us down from the Justice Department?
[03:12:57.239 --> 03:12:59.520]  Because again, the Justice Department can assign these to bankruptcies.
[03:12:59.719 --> 03:13:00.579]  They don't hardly ever do it.
[03:13:00.659 --> 03:13:01.059]  They did it with me.
[03:13:01.420 --> 03:13:02.600]  People find that hard to believe.
[03:13:02.760 --> 03:13:10.719]  No, the government is run by crazy people under Biden, and they will follow it basically any order they're told.
[03:13:12.360 --> 03:13:12.979]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:19.139]  And I'm hoping that once Trump takes office again, we'll get Doge, we'll get that started up.
[03:13:19.239 --> 03:13:25.100]  And Doge is going to do more than just be somebody that's recommending cost cuts and such.
[03:13:25.219 --> 03:13:28.440]  They're going to expose the ineptitude and the corruption.
[03:13:28.440 --> 03:13:34.340]  You have two ends of it, where it's hard to tell sometimes who's stupid and who's corrupt, because there are a lot of both in the government.
[03:13:34.739 --> 03:13:39.360]  And that's what Doge and Elon and Vivek are going to be doing, and I'm so excited for that.
[03:13:41.739 --> 03:13:42.500]  All right, stay there.
[03:13:42.600 --> 03:13:44.940]  I want to take some calls, cover some other issues with Nick Sorter.
[03:13:45.120 --> 03:13:48.579]  Nick, we have a lot of radio listeners that can't see your lower Chiron.
[03:13:48.840 --> 03:13:59.920]  How do people follow you on the Mighty X? They follow me on X and only X at Nick Sorter, N-I-C-K-S-O-R-T-O-R. Stay there, my friend.
[03:14:05.479 --> 03:14:07.600]  We're good to go.
[03:14:20.450 --> 03:14:28.069]  He is basically investing billions of dollars in trying to manipulate the guts of people with so-called mRNA vaccines.
[03:14:28.309 --> 03:14:28.889]  It's insane.
[03:14:29.090 --> 03:14:35.290]  But all the research is just overwhelming that happy gut means happy, healthy body.
[03:14:35.530 --> 03:14:46.110]  We now have the ultimate gut combo with the ultimate probiotic with 60 billion, super high quality, with this baby, ultimate gut cleanse.
[03:14:46.290 --> 03:14:49.440]  Now, These are both private labels, some of the top brands in the country.
[03:14:49.659 --> 03:14:52.319]  Our sponsors had to make it a little bit stronger, so it's proprietary.
[03:14:53.139 --> 03:14:56.520]  And the probiotics are very exciting and just a foundational thing that everybody should be doing.
[03:14:57.420 --> 03:14:58.520]  This is amazing.
[03:14:58.520 --> 03:14:59.879]  It's not just a gut cleanse.
[03:15:00.700 --> 03:15:07.420]  We may rename it down the road to gut cleanse, detox, anti-parasite.
[03:15:08.229 --> 03:15:20.069]  Pro-prostate, because it's concentrated, it's super strong, and it's got the gut cleanse, it's got the anti-parasite, it's got the saw palmetto.
[03:15:20.190 --> 03:15:26.469]  For not just your prostate, it's good for all your glands, but even the government's admitted for decades, saw palmetto is It's insane.
[03:15:26.590 --> 03:15:26.930]  Look it up.
[03:15:27.090 --> 03:15:29.469]  So this is beyond a gut cleanse.
[03:15:29.709 --> 03:15:31.670]  It's got the trifecta going.
[03:15:31.870 --> 03:15:40.670]  I don't have time to read to you all of the amazing ingredients in this, but you can get Ultimate Gut Cleanse for 30 to 50% off, depending on how many bottles you get.
[03:15:40.829 --> 03:15:45.690]  And you can get Ultimate Probiotic for 30 to 50% off, depending on how many bottles you get.
[03:15:45.829 --> 03:15:52.850]  Or you can get both together in the Ultimate Combo for 50% off as an introductory offer right now.
[03:15:53.890 --> 03:15:55.069]  At thealexshowstore.com.
[03:15:55.450 --> 03:15:57.069]  And it's going to keep the broadcast on the air.
[03:15:57.250 --> 03:15:57.909]  That's a win-win.
[03:15:58.110 --> 03:15:58.770]  Please take action.
[03:16:00.110 --> 03:16:01.290]  Nick Sordor is our guest.
[03:16:01.389 --> 03:16:04.889]  We're going to take some calls here on World War III and the New World Order.
[03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:08.309]  Brett, Colby, and Terry are the last callers we'll get to.
[03:16:08.350 --> 03:16:09.850]  We're going to you in a moment, but...
[03:16:11.339 --> 03:16:15.979]  Nick, people that tell me, I know other talk shows, oh, today was a slow news day or this day was a slow news day.
[03:16:16.219 --> 03:16:17.200]  They must be insane.
[03:16:17.520 --> 03:16:18.540]  I've been on there 30 years.
[03:16:18.659 --> 03:16:19.860]  There's never a slow news day.
[03:16:20.159 --> 03:16:26.840]  But the stuff I did 30 years ago or 20 years ago or 10 years ago or a year ago, those were slow news days compared to this.
[03:16:27.239 --> 03:16:35.239]  I mean, I haven't played these clips because they don't compare to World War III and nuclear weapons test drills and, you know, all the rest of it.
[03:16:35.340 --> 03:16:37.219]  And Putin saying there'll be more responses and all of this.
[03:16:37.770 --> 03:16:49.409]  The footage of the hearings on, you know, these diversity hearings where there's literally Democrat members of Congress saying white people are evil.
[03:16:49.649 --> 03:16:50.549]  I mean...
[03:16:52.649 --> 03:16:57.129]  This whole leftist thing is a BlackRock CIA get us all to kill each other crap.
[03:16:57.129 --> 03:17:00.170]  It's so obvious and people are really figuring it out.
[03:17:00.370 --> 03:17:01.209]  It's beautiful.
[03:17:01.450 --> 03:17:05.530]  And now because people are waking up from the trance, this clown crap isn't working anymore.
[03:17:05.670 --> 03:17:07.290]  What do you think the system's going to do?
[03:17:07.370 --> 03:17:09.069]  I mean, other than World War III to stop this.
[03:17:11.059 --> 03:17:13.540]  Well, see, the thing is, Alex, I don't think they're going to stop.
[03:17:13.639 --> 03:17:19.059]  They're going to continue as the Democrats and these operatives have proven.
[03:17:19.239 --> 03:17:29.159]  I mean, one of the ones that you just made the example of, Jasmine Crockett, who was in that hearing yesterday when that anti-DEI bill was going through committee.
[03:17:29.440 --> 03:17:42.379]  Jasmine Crockett, based out of Texas, This Democrat congresswoman, probably close to taking the cake for the dumbest member of Congress, and that is a really, really tough achievement.
[03:17:43.540 --> 03:17:56.200]  She's basically saying that she doesn't want to be here, that she never wanted to be here, and that she was forcefully put in the United States of America, and that white people cannot face oppression no matter what.
[03:17:56.280 --> 03:17:56.959]  It's only her.
[03:17:57.309 --> 03:18:00.350]  The sitting congresswoman is oppressed, Alex.
[03:18:00.510 --> 03:18:07.829]  I mean, that's pretty impressive to me, but they have shown no signs, no signs at all that they've learned anything from this election.
[03:18:07.969 --> 03:18:12.309]  If anything, they've doubled down on it because the American people have been very, very crystal clear.
[03:18:13.090 --> 03:18:27.750]  That they don't want this trans ideology and men using women's bathrooms and, you know, minorities that are less qualified getting a position just because they're not white.
[03:18:27.989 --> 03:18:29.209]  I mean, what happened?
[03:18:29.389 --> 03:18:33.770]  How did we get to the point where merit-based hiring is controversial?
[03:18:34.030 --> 03:18:34.629]  Well, let's be clear.
[03:18:34.989 --> 03:18:39.870]  They claim they're trying to empower people that aren't white.
[03:18:41.020 --> 03:18:43.260]  Then they lie and say Kamala Harris is black.
[03:18:43.680 --> 03:18:47.399]  They could have found plenty of smart, dynamic black women if they wanted to.
[03:18:47.620 --> 03:18:47.860]  No, no.
[03:18:47.920 --> 03:18:49.100]  They want puppets.
[03:18:49.479 --> 03:18:51.559]  And so they hide behind black people.
[03:18:51.680 --> 03:18:52.739]  They hide behind women.
[03:18:52.819 --> 03:18:56.620]  And all the numbers show, quote, minorities are figuring this out real quick.
[03:18:57.819 --> 03:19:01.360]  Minorities are absolutely figuring it out real quick because look at how they voted for President Trump.
[03:19:01.719 --> 03:19:02.760]  I mean, it was through the roof.
[03:19:02.879 --> 03:19:04.340]  The numbers were through the roof.
[03:19:04.479 --> 03:19:11.200]  No Republican president has ever had more minorities vote for them than President Trump this cycle.
[03:19:11.379 --> 03:19:12.899]  They understand that they're waking up.
[03:19:12.979 --> 03:19:15.180]  They're tired of being used as pawns.
[03:19:15.659 --> 03:19:19.959]  But the deep state and the Democrats aren't accepting that fact.
[03:19:20.059 --> 03:19:23.149]  They think that they can just Keep pushing and pushing and pushing.
[03:19:23.430 --> 03:19:26.370]  As the economy falls apart, they blame white people.
[03:19:26.489 --> 03:19:29.829]  Yeah, it's a bunch of old white people at the top, but getting us all to kill each other.
[03:19:29.909 --> 03:19:34.409]  But of the top nine groups by race that make the most money, it's all Asians.
[03:19:34.770 --> 03:19:37.170]  And I'm not bashing Asians that are smart and hardworking.
[03:19:37.389 --> 03:19:39.229]  But the point is, is that...
[03:19:40.020 --> 03:19:44.159]  It's totally insane and it's not working anymore.
[03:19:44.420 --> 03:19:50.100]  Let's play a clip of Representative Jasmine Crockett.
[03:19:50.299 --> 03:19:51.219]  Here it is.
[03:19:51.500 --> 03:19:55.379]  It's because you can then misuse words like oppression.
[03:19:55.379 --> 03:19:59.040]  There has been no oppression for the white man in this country.
[03:20:00.030 --> 03:20:03.829]  You tell me which white men were dragged out of their homes.
[03:20:04.149 --> 03:20:11.989]  You tell me which one of them got dragged all the way across an ocean and told that you are going to go and work.
[03:20:12.229 --> 03:20:14.309]  We are going to steal your wives.
[03:20:14.610 --> 03:20:15.889]  We are going to rape your wives.
[03:20:16.030 --> 03:20:16.809]  That didn't happen.
[03:20:16.950 --> 03:20:17.729]  That is oppression.
[03:20:18.959 --> 03:20:20.500]  We didn't ask to be here.
[03:20:20.780 --> 03:20:25.200]  We're not the same migrants that y'all constantly come up against.
[03:20:25.500 --> 03:20:27.680]  We didn't run away from home.
[03:20:27.680 --> 03:20:28.639]  We were stolen.
[03:20:29.540 --> 03:20:36.799]  So yeah, we are going to sit here and be offended when you want to sit here and act like, and don't let it escape you.
[03:20:37.459 --> 03:20:46.600]  That it is white men on this side of the aisle telling us, people of color on this side of the aisle, that y'all are the ones being oppressed.
[03:20:47.569 --> 03:20:49.670]  That y'all are the ones that are being harmed.
[03:20:51.350 --> 03:21:00.040]  Imagine that woman doesn't even know that The vast majority of white people in this country, ancestors, came here after slavery.
[03:21:00.180 --> 03:21:04.100]  She doesn't know that the Communists killed 20 million Christians in Russia.
[03:21:04.239 --> 03:21:07.979]  She doesn't know Mao Zedong under CIA direction killed 80 million of his own people.
[03:21:08.159 --> 03:21:14.399]  She doesn't know that 26 million Russians died, or 25 million Russians died fighting the Nazis.
[03:21:14.620 --> 03:21:30.690]  She doesn't, she literally thinks people hundreds of years ago, I guarantee she doesn't even look up her ancestors' names, Are victims, so she's a victim now, and then looks at white people, most of whom don't even know who their great-great-grandma was, and points at them and says,
[03:21:30.809 --> 03:21:36.030]  you're enslaving me, and white people are having trouble paying their bills too, and they're like, what the hell are you talking about, lady?
[03:21:36.250 --> 03:21:37.290]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[03:21:38.280 --> 03:21:45.659]  No, and it's even more ridiculous when, you know, first off, I'll comment on that and say, okay, so Jasmine Crockett said that she didn't want to be taken from home.
[03:21:45.819 --> 03:21:47.879]  I don't know where home is for Jasmine Crockett.
[03:21:48.180 --> 03:21:50.600]  Clearly, she says it's not the United States of America.
[03:21:50.799 --> 03:21:52.940]  I will personally vouch right now.
[03:21:52.940 --> 03:21:59.120]  I will pay the full one-way fee to wherever home is for Jasmine Crockett.
[03:21:59.200 --> 03:21:59.899]  I'll pay it full.
[03:22:00.360 --> 03:22:02.020]  She can go back and send her back.
[03:22:02.600 --> 03:22:07.639]  Secondly, white people in Western North Carolina, she's saying that white people haven't been oppressed at all.
[03:22:07.860 --> 03:22:14.600]  These are the people that I have never seen a group of people more oppressed than these guys out there right now.
[03:22:14.920 --> 03:22:20.860]  Alex, I don't know if you've heard this recently, but FEMA so far has given out two trailers.
[03:22:21.100 --> 03:22:21.479]  Two trailers.
[03:22:22.800 --> 03:22:25.180]  Well, I mean, FEMA listed them as terrorists.
[03:22:25.280 --> 03:22:26.260]  That's now official.
[03:22:26.899 --> 03:22:28.940]  All right, let's jam in a few calls.
[03:22:29.739 --> 03:22:30.579]  Let's jam in a few calls.
[03:22:30.680 --> 03:22:32.420]  I got breaking news we're going to get to here in a few minutes.
[03:22:32.860 --> 03:22:34.319]  Huge news about the deep state attacks.
[03:22:35.040 --> 03:22:36.280]  But let's go to Brett in Arizona.
[03:22:36.440 --> 03:22:37.639]  Brett, you're on the air with Nick Swardor.
[03:22:37.739 --> 03:22:37.979]  Go ahead.
[03:22:39.620 --> 03:22:40.600]  Hey, God bless you, brother.
[03:22:40.739 --> 03:22:41.760]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:22:42.500 --> 03:22:49.979]  You answered a majority of my questions with your vast knowledge with the weapons that are going to be coming through and the war doctrine and everything.
[03:22:51.010 --> 03:22:52.989]  I live just outside of the Phoenix metro.
[03:22:53.770 --> 03:23:12.049]  Got family that is back on the foothills in Colorado, like around NORAD. Would it be your suggestion if this possibly goes to phase two, maybe start thinking about mobilizing and trying to survive maybe just the inner city chaos or just around those high value targets like a big metro?
[03:23:12.190 --> 03:23:16.590]  Yeah, I mean, I would say right now there's about a 20% chance of nuclear war in the next month.
[03:23:18.530 --> 03:23:20.649]  If it keeps escalating, 50-60% chance.
[03:23:20.850 --> 03:23:26.450]  The first place Russia's going to hit, they've already said they're going to do a demonstration, will be probably Poland or Ukraine.
[03:23:26.670 --> 03:23:28.649]  Because Poland's the main staging area.
[03:23:28.930 --> 03:23:32.049]  Putin said today they're preparing a nuclear strike demonstration.
[03:23:32.329 --> 03:23:33.870]  They just showed they can deliver it.
[03:23:33.930 --> 03:23:38.629]  Now that he said that, that backs up the exact statements made by McGregor in the last month.
[03:23:40.389 --> 03:23:44.549]  If they start firing at NORAD, the alternate government, and the head of...
[03:23:46.229 --> 03:23:58.510]  The shadow government, COG, I mean, at that point, I have a life force, and I don't want to die, but I know the ICBMs are coming into Austin.
[03:23:58.590 --> 03:24:00.790]  I think I'll get up to the highest point so I get killed immediately.
[03:24:01.049 --> 03:24:06.510]  I wouldn't do that, but my point is that they start bombing Colorado, baby.
[03:24:06.690 --> 03:24:07.549]  It's over.
[03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:09.229]  So...
[03:24:10.129 --> 03:24:16.290]  You could run to the Southern Hemisphere, but that'll all collapse into absolute World War Z type stuff.
[03:24:17.270 --> 03:24:18.649]  There's a major nuclear war.
[03:24:18.870 --> 03:24:23.790]  The surface of the Earth is going to make Mad Max look like a tea party, a cakewalk.
[03:24:24.329 --> 03:24:25.350]  Does that answer your question?
[03:24:26.549 --> 03:24:27.270]  Yes, it does.
[03:24:27.469 --> 03:24:29.569]  I mean, we're kind of the same thought.
[03:24:29.729 --> 03:24:32.750]  We're believers, and nothing would be better to go.
[03:24:34.659 --> 03:24:36.319]  Repress ourselves with our Lord and Savior.
[03:24:36.959 --> 03:24:41.540]  But just something to think about that we were thinking just to try to inhabit if something were to progress.
[03:24:41.680 --> 03:24:41.959]  Oh, yeah.
[03:24:42.040 --> 03:24:47.260]  I mean, I wouldn't want to live anywhere near Cheyenne Mountain, if I was you, or Colorado Springs.
[03:24:47.379 --> 03:24:47.879]  Thank you.
[03:24:48.040 --> 03:24:49.319]  That's never a good place to be anyway.
[03:24:49.420 --> 03:24:58.899]  That's the second most targeted target in CONUS. After D.C. is the alternate government and the real command base is there at...
[03:24:59.510 --> 03:25:00.270]  They're in Colorado Springs.
[03:25:00.590 --> 03:25:02.629]  Let's jam in another call here.
[03:25:02.889 --> 03:25:04.229]  Colby, you're on the air with Nick Sordor.
[03:25:04.329 --> 03:25:04.610]  Go ahead.
[03:25:05.889 --> 03:25:06.989]  Oh my goodness.
[03:25:07.250 --> 03:25:08.350]  Alex, I love you.
[03:25:08.790 --> 03:25:10.350]  And you are a blessing.
[03:25:10.709 --> 03:25:12.909]  You blow the trumpet and I hear you.
[03:25:13.229 --> 03:25:20.309]  And you are the only one that I go to to listen, to hear what's going on.
[03:25:20.530 --> 03:25:24.629]  And the trumpet that you blow is truth and truth.
[03:25:26.389 --> 03:25:41.530]  It brings me peace and it relieves me of my anxiety so I appreciate your documenting life and sharing it with the world and I just I sincerely love you,
[03:25:41.590 --> 03:25:42.469]  and I thank God for you.
[03:25:42.489 --> 03:25:43.030]  Well, I appreciate you.
[03:25:43.229 --> 03:25:44.610]  I mean, God drives me to do this.
[03:25:45.290 --> 03:25:49.510]  A, we're trying to fix things to make the world better, but this is my therapy is fighting this.
[03:25:49.649 --> 03:25:50.450]  It's the exact same thing.
[03:25:50.510 --> 03:25:51.709]  It brings me peace to study this.
[03:25:51.829 --> 03:25:53.110]  It brings me peace to fight.
[03:25:53.389 --> 03:25:58.709]  I was up at midnight last night researching, making phone calls about what Trump's up to because I was concerned about him not making statements.
[03:25:58.809 --> 03:26:04.790]  I learned what was happening, and I was put in this position so I could be able to learn that stuff, and that's really the big takeaway today is that Trump is on the phone.
[03:26:04.790 --> 03:26:05.870]  He is trying to get a ceasefire.
[03:26:06.149 --> 03:26:07.850]  That is so beautiful, Colby.
[03:26:09.190 --> 03:26:10.190]  Thank you so much.
[03:26:10.409 --> 03:26:10.950]  Bless you.
[03:26:11.049 --> 03:26:11.629]  Thank you, Colby.
[03:26:13.290 --> 03:26:14.670]  Let's jam in Terry in Pennsylvania.
[03:26:14.930 --> 03:26:15.409]  Terry, you're on the air.
[03:26:15.489 --> 03:26:15.649]  Go ahead.
[03:26:18.729 --> 03:26:19.649]  All right, Terry's gone.
[03:26:19.770 --> 03:26:20.170]  Thank you, Terry.
[03:26:20.909 --> 03:26:22.690]  Nick Sordor, thank you for spending time.
[03:26:22.690 --> 03:26:25.969]  I wanted to get you to host some today, but the stuff was breaking so much.
[03:26:26.090 --> 03:26:27.010]  Will you come back on?
[03:26:27.069 --> 03:26:33.229]  Because I see the stuff you're doing and host an hour with us soon, and I can't wait to see you back in Austin, brother.
[03:26:34.170 --> 03:26:34.829]  Let's do it, man.
[03:26:34.889 --> 03:26:35.270]  Let's do it.
[03:26:36.069 --> 03:26:38.370]  All right, people follow you on X at...
[03:26:39.170 --> 03:26:43.290]  At Nick Sorter, N-I-C-K-S-O-R-T-O-R. All right, thank you, Nick.
[03:26:43.389 --> 03:26:43.610]  Love you.
[03:26:43.989 --> 03:26:48.250]  All right, Owen Schroer is coming up in 15 minutes.
[03:26:48.430 --> 03:26:52.209]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen, and this is what we're going through.
[03:26:53.350 --> 03:27:00.950]  And these people just think it's open season on me and you, and they think we're going to sit here and take this.
[03:27:01.049 --> 03:27:02.750]  Now, I don't know if The Onion launched this attack.
[03:27:05.040 --> 03:27:15.459]  I don't know the fact that their people were in the building Thursday and then ran off and left when they figured out that the judge was pissed Thursday after the hearing.
[03:27:16.860 --> 03:27:23.860]  And I'm not saying the Onion or the Everytown gun control group of the Democrats hacked into the fundraiser.
[03:27:24.559 --> 03:27:25.899]  But we know this.
[03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:28.360]  They don't want us fundraising and they're pissed off about it.
[03:27:28.459 --> 03:27:32.219]  And they don't want you supporting the sponsor, the AlexJonesStore.com.
[03:27:33.850 --> 03:27:35.649]  Where the funds will go to defend ourselves.
[03:27:35.930 --> 03:27:37.329]  They are attacking us.
[03:27:38.909 --> 03:27:51.170]  The last trustee tried to close the building on the 31st of May.
[03:27:52.370 --> 03:27:59.290]  And so this is all extremely illustrative of where we are.
[03:28:00.239 --> 03:28:01.399]  And they've done it again.
[03:28:01.760 --> 03:28:05.219]  And as you saw everywhere, we were supposedly off the air, closed forever.
[03:28:05.319 --> 03:28:06.280]  The Onion owned us.
[03:28:07.299 --> 03:28:12.879]  And in the lawsuit I filed Tuesday, it's all the documents in there for you to see for yourself.
[03:28:12.879 --> 03:28:16.799]  But the way to support is the AlexJoneStore.com.
[03:28:17.180 --> 03:28:20.399]  And that will go to the legal defense as well.
[03:28:21.520 --> 03:28:23.020]  So that's where we are.
[03:28:23.620 --> 03:28:24.639]  That's what's happening.
[03:28:25.590 --> 03:28:31.170]  That's what's unfolding, and I cannot do any of this without your help.
[03:28:32.209 --> 03:28:34.030]  I'm going to explain this term again.
[03:28:34.069 --> 03:28:42.350]  In fact, Rob put a video together of Larry Pinckney when he was on your stay, and I didn't ask him to do this.
[03:28:42.510 --> 03:28:57.149]  He was coming on about World War III and the Trump election, and he said, listen, Alex, you may not like it, and you may not like to admit it, but you have been chosen by the people, just like Trump, As a champion.
[03:28:57.450 --> 03:28:58.870]  And the enemy sees you as a champion.
[03:28:59.209 --> 03:29:03.750]  And so they're coming after you to get to us.
[03:29:03.829 --> 03:29:05.190]  Now I know that's true too.
[03:29:05.829 --> 03:29:11.290]  But we need people to understand that.
[03:29:11.430 --> 03:29:13.110]  And I know most of the audience gets that.
[03:29:14.850 --> 03:29:17.389]  But we are being targeted...
[03:29:19.469 --> 03:29:21.290]  Because we've been so effective with the truth.
[03:29:21.569 --> 03:29:27.829]  And if they can take me off the air, they've now admitted what I told you years ago, because I figured it out.
[03:29:28.090 --> 03:29:29.370]  They want my identity.
[03:29:29.530 --> 03:29:35.270]  They want me silenced so they can create this emoji.
[03:29:36.780 --> 03:29:44.360]  This avatar that isn't Alex Jones, that they say is Alex Jones, to then demonize the rest of the patriots.
[03:29:44.459 --> 03:29:45.739]  That's how propaganda works.
[03:29:45.860 --> 03:29:46.879]  That's how psyops work.
[03:29:47.200 --> 03:29:50.819]  That's how these archetypal systems work.
[03:29:53.899 --> 03:29:56.100]  So, again...
[03:29:59.629 --> 03:30:02.450]  It's so simple, but it gets missed by a lot of people.
[03:30:03.149 --> 03:30:17.170]  And I know the general audience is really smart and really informed, but people still just have a subconscious belief that, okay, well, I see all these other shows, and they sell books or products or whatever to fund themselves, but why is Alex Jones saying, I need your support?
[03:30:17.170 --> 03:30:18.110]  I need your support.
[03:30:18.270 --> 03:30:20.149]  I need you to go to thealexonestore.com.
[03:30:20.629 --> 03:30:26.129]  Other people do not have the Democratic Party that has spent upwards of $80 million.
[03:30:26.309 --> 03:30:27.610]  They filed this in the courts.
[03:30:31.829 --> 03:30:34.170]  To shut us down in the last seven years.
[03:30:35.149 --> 03:30:39.270]  The lawfare that Trump has been targeted with, I have been targeted with it.
[03:30:39.329 --> 03:30:40.049]  I am not Trump.
[03:30:40.250 --> 03:30:41.370]  I am not Elon Musk.
[03:30:41.549 --> 03:30:46.770]  I have never had more than $10 million in the bank.
[03:30:49.149 --> 03:30:53.430]  At one point, I had $10 million in the bank three years ago.
[03:30:54.469 --> 03:30:59.790]  And that money was there to fund the resistance as a backup.
[03:31:02.629 --> 03:31:09.469]  And I only had a million dollars in backup, which is nothing for an operation this big, and they got a nine million dollar Bitcoin donation.
[03:31:09.829 --> 03:31:20.989]  And I cashed it in, put it in the account, and then all of it went to legal defense, studio, infrastructure, and I gave the crew small bonuses.
[03:31:23.420 --> 03:31:31.940]  And remember, in the Connecticut rigged trial case where I was already found guilty, the former federal prosecutor, the Democrat operative, gets up there and he says, so, you got $9 million in Bitcoin.
[03:31:32.500 --> 03:31:33.479]  Or how much money do you get in Bitcoin?
[03:31:33.600 --> 03:31:35.459]  I was like, it was like $8.9 million when we got it.
[03:31:35.579 --> 03:31:38.780]  By the time I sold it, it had gone down, so I think $8.7 million, I'm going from memory.
[03:31:39.200 --> 03:31:39.879]  He goes, oh, really?
[03:31:40.000 --> 03:31:40.399]  And what'd you do?
[03:31:40.440 --> 03:31:41.239]  They'd stick that right in your pocket?
[03:31:42.440 --> 03:31:44.819]  And I said, no, it was given to me personally.
[03:31:44.819 --> 03:31:46.940]  I could have done that, but I put it into the company.
[03:31:47.600 --> 03:31:49.620]  Really, because the Justice Department's going to be really interested in Mr.
[03:31:49.819 --> 03:31:50.020]  Jones.
[03:31:50.399 --> 03:31:52.079]  You want this jury to believe...
[03:31:52.680 --> 03:31:55.159]  We're all staring at me like I'm Satan because I've already been told I'm guilty by the judge.
[03:31:56.159 --> 03:31:56.920]  You ever heard of that before?
[03:31:57.559 --> 03:31:58.600]  She already found me guilty.
[03:31:58.879 --> 03:31:59.739]  She says, this man is guilty.
[03:31:59.860 --> 03:32:00.600]  You're going to decide how guilty.
[03:32:02.579 --> 03:32:12.180]  He said, you're going to tell this jury that you gave all of that money into Infowars in the company.
[03:32:12.360 --> 03:32:13.040]  I said, yep.
[03:32:15.180 --> 03:32:15.739]  He goes, really?
[03:32:15.799 --> 03:32:16.319]  I don't believe that.
[03:32:16.399 --> 03:32:17.819]  You sure you want to change your testimony?
[03:32:18.219 --> 03:32:18.899]  I said, no.
[03:32:21.520 --> 03:32:25.940]  And he looked at me and he went, really?
[03:32:27.739 --> 03:32:28.280]  All right, Mr.
[03:32:28.340 --> 03:32:30.059]  Jones, some people are going to be real interested in that.
[03:32:31.260 --> 03:32:33.819]  Because if I kept the money and said it, I could have kept it.
[03:32:34.399 --> 03:32:42.579]  But if I perjured myself and said I gave it all to the operation, but I never even thought about that when I did it.
[03:32:43.299 --> 03:32:44.540]  We needed that money.
[03:32:45.000 --> 03:33:05.639]  And after all the accounting was done six months ago of the last three years, it turned out that that 8.7 or whatever it was when we cashed out was exactly the amount of money of shortfalls over those years that we needed for legal and crew and satellites and servers and everything and travel and reporting.
[03:33:06.500 --> 03:33:10.040]  So that was God, whoever worked through, and they're like, oh, and who gave it to you?
[03:33:10.120 --> 03:33:10.680]  I don't know.
[03:33:10.739 --> 03:33:11.040]  It's anonymous.
[03:33:11.909 --> 03:33:12.729]  We're going to find out.
[03:33:12.850 --> 03:33:13.889]  You're going to go to jail if you're lying.
[03:33:14.049 --> 03:33:15.170]  It's all just over.
[03:33:15.329 --> 03:33:35.690]  You saw that on national TV. I've been here in bankruptcy for two years in hearing after hearing and in deposition after deposition where the U.S. Justice Department is there and the plaintiff's lawyers and the Justice Department hand me at these meetings in person,
[03:33:35.829 --> 03:33:36.350]  some on Zoom.
[03:33:38.079 --> 03:33:49.520]  They hand me the U.S. Code and give me two examples of bankruptcy fraud, not that I did, but saying, if you make a false statement, you're going to go to prison.
[03:33:51.239 --> 03:33:53.739]  And I'm sitting there going, okay, well, I have accountants and outside groups.
[03:33:53.739 --> 03:33:55.979]  I don't really even touch the money, but I'll answer as best I can.
[03:33:56.200 --> 03:34:00.360]  Yeah, I mean, they're there talking to a Boy Scout, and they know that.
[03:34:01.730 --> 03:34:03.409]  And somebody that's totally committed.
[03:34:03.510 --> 03:34:04.309]  I'll give my life for freedom.
[03:34:04.590 --> 03:34:05.110]  Money's nothing.
[03:34:05.290 --> 03:34:06.350]  It's just fuel to fight.
[03:34:07.030 --> 03:34:08.110]  It's ammunition in the Infowar.
[03:34:08.790 --> 03:34:17.239]  And after all that and outside accounting firms coming in and everything and being audited, I was found to have done nothing wrong.
[03:34:17.440 --> 03:34:27.440]  And then the last trustee tried to set me up, tried to tell the judge I was a crook, was so lazy they hadn't even checked that I'd filed all over the court in my personal bankruptcy.
[03:34:27.920 --> 03:34:36.000]  He wouldn't take the little bit of money we had from an outside sponsor for years that once I got into personal bankruptcy, I was trying to put into Infowars.
[03:34:37.920 --> 03:34:40.399]  Wouldn't take it, said it was fine in front of my lawyers.
[03:34:40.540 --> 03:34:41.479]  They said, that's the setup.
[03:34:41.680 --> 03:34:44.399]  So we follow the court and said, we have this money, he won't take it.
[03:34:45.760 --> 03:34:50.360]  So he goes months later and files a secret document that he caught me stealing money.
[03:34:53.579 --> 03:34:54.780]  That's what I'm dealing with.
[03:34:54.879 --> 03:34:56.899]  And I'm supposed to sit here and like these people?
[03:34:57.600 --> 03:35:02.280]  I'm supposed to sit here while they're trying to put me in prison for no reason because I'm Alex Jones?
[03:35:03.500 --> 03:35:04.860]  So I'm suing them.
[03:35:05.379 --> 03:35:06.379]  And I've got them.
[03:35:09.959 --> 03:35:16.040]  But I need your support at the AlexJonesStore.com for the Alex Jones Network, hopefully to keep this place going.
[03:35:17.159 --> 03:35:18.500]  And I'm going to explain it again.
[03:35:18.700 --> 03:35:21.360]  And we're going to go to Owen Schroer in the war room coming up.
[03:35:30.100 --> 03:35:36.520]  I didn't think about money when they were in the building and turned the internet off and shut us down last Thursday.
[03:35:36.799 --> 03:35:38.600]  I didn't look at money until Tuesday.
[03:35:42.569 --> 03:35:46.229]  And I figured, hey, I bet extra money came in to the AlexHillStore.com.
[03:35:46.610 --> 03:35:48.110]  And they went, yeah, we didn't want to tell you.
[03:35:48.209 --> 03:35:49.569]  It's like down by 50-something percent.
[03:35:50.389 --> 03:35:52.270]  People think that's owned by The Onion.
[03:35:52.430 --> 03:35:54.209]  I'm like, well, we got to tell them.
[03:35:54.430 --> 03:35:55.489]  I mean, it's not.
[03:35:55.670 --> 03:35:57.930]  The Alex Hill Store is owned by a sponsor, and it's what's keeping us on air.
[03:36:00.170 --> 03:36:02.250]  And then I'm like, well, what's happening over at the M4 store?
[03:36:02.889 --> 03:36:04.010]  70-plus percent are out.
[03:36:05.850 --> 03:36:09.370]  Because they fraudulently claimed they owned it and said, don't send money.
[03:36:10.459 --> 03:36:13.559]  And the guy got on TV and said, oh, we're going to give Severance Pay the Infowars employees.
[03:36:14.340 --> 03:36:16.120]  We're going to all give them a bottle of brain force.
[03:36:17.700 --> 03:36:19.780]  Just rubbing it in.
[03:36:20.440 --> 03:36:21.719]  Because they're the loving liberals, remember?
[03:36:23.139 --> 03:36:25.879]  The ones that FEMA listed the North Carolinians as terrorists.
[03:36:26.799 --> 03:36:28.020]  If they had a Trump sign.
[03:36:30.319 --> 03:36:32.840]  So this is their attitude towards us.
[03:36:33.459 --> 03:36:34.659]  This is who they are.
[03:36:34.819 --> 03:36:36.719]  And they're going to win...
[03:36:37.629 --> 03:36:41.030]  If you don't support us at TheAlexShowStore.com, it's that simple.
[03:36:41.170 --> 03:36:45.430]  We're going to win if we have the money to litigate them.
[03:36:46.110 --> 03:36:48.590]  We have their ass.
[03:36:48.709 --> 03:36:54.790]  We have them in official conspiracy against constitutional rights.
[03:36:57.049 --> 03:36:58.829]  We have the National Gun Control Group.
[03:36:58.930 --> 03:37:00.309]  We have their front, the Onion.
[03:37:00.549 --> 03:37:01.709]  We have the U.S. Trustee.
[03:37:02.069 --> 03:37:03.750]  We have the Democrat Party lawyers.
[03:37:03.950 --> 03:37:05.329]  We have their front people.
[03:37:05.510 --> 03:37:07.409]  I've sued them all.
[03:37:08.770 --> 03:37:10.629]  We're done on the defense.
[03:37:11.170 --> 03:37:13.670]  And quite frankly, I prayed about this a lot in the last few years.
[03:37:13.750 --> 03:37:15.750]  The Holy Spirit told me, hold them off.
[03:37:16.549 --> 03:37:19.969]  Do not go on offense until Trump is back in.
[03:37:22.959 --> 03:37:27.819]  And then God told me, even before this happened about a month ago, said, now prepare the offense.
[03:37:28.500 --> 03:37:30.719]  I'm following the Holy Spirit.
[03:37:31.750 --> 03:37:33.170]  Now, follow the Holy Spirit.
[03:37:33.170 --> 03:37:38.969]  If you've got the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit tells you to support us at thealexjonesstore.com, go there now.
[03:37:39.110 --> 03:37:40.389]  I'm counting on you.
[03:37:40.549 --> 03:37:42.750]  We'll be back with Owen Schroyer.
[03:37:43.370 --> 03:37:45.590]  So, I'm just asking you to keep me in the fight.
[03:37:45.950 --> 03:37:51.870]  And we got great t-shirts and incredible blow-you-away supplements and everything, and our great sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:37:52.090 --> 03:37:58.270]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction, because I hadn't really...
[03:37:59.130 --> 03:38:02.430]  There's other folks on this, other folks that are great run this, the folks at Bigly.
[03:38:02.750 --> 03:38:05.549]  Great Patriot backers, Total Patriots, J6ers, you name it.
[03:38:06.430 --> 03:38:08.809]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[03:38:09.010 --> 03:38:12.750]  So, when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[03:38:13.459 --> 03:38:23.579]  So, if you're a member of the Alice Jones VIP Club at AliceJonesStore.com forward slash VIP, or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation.
[03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:26.379]  We don't know what the future holds for the operation.
