[00:00:18.843 --> 00:00:29.186]  It's Friday, August 2nd, 2024, and we are going to expose the globalist control grid and give humanity the choice
[00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:31.323]  To fight back and be free?
[00:00:31.703 --> 00:00:33.144]  Or lay down and die as slaves?
[00:00:38.848 --> 00:00:39.489]  The Grid.
[00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:45.973]  A digital frontier.
[00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:52.198]  I tried to picture clusters of information as they move through the computer.
[00:00:52.998 --> 00:00:53.939]  What do they look like?
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.040]  Ships?
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.041]  Motorcycles?
[00:00:57.742 --> 00:00:59.243]  Were the circuits like freeways?
[00:01:02.494 --> 00:01:05.700]  I kept dreaming of the world I thought I'd never see.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.842]  And then, one day, I got in.
[00:01:40.839 --> 00:01:44.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.800]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:57.683]  Twenty days ago, in Butler, Pennsylvania, the deep state tried to kill President Trump.
[00:01:57.783 --> 00:01:59.803]  And I told you that day, it was a clear stand-down.
[00:02:01.084 --> 00:02:06.705]  I have followed and studied how the Secret Service operates, going back to the days of Abraham Lincoln.
[00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:12.209]  And at key points in history, they stand down so that presidents can be killed.
[00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:14.190]  They stood down with Lincoln.
[00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.612]  They stood down, of course, with JFK.
[00:02:17.672 --> 00:02:18.893]  They stood down with Ronald Reagan.
[00:02:18.913 --> 00:02:21.334]  They stood down with President Trump.
[00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:27.938]  And we now have multiple high-level whistleblowers from the Secret Service and local police all telling the same story.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.200]  No.
[00:02:32.287 --> 00:02:40.652]  Threat assessment team that makes the calls into the snipers and gives the orders on who to kill was there.
[00:02:42.213 --> 00:02:52.219]  And the now acting director, who was the deputy director at the time, Ronald Rowe, who testified this week, that he didn't know who cut down the staff.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.482]  He lied directly, even worse than Fauci lied.
[00:02:57.402 --> 00:02:58.243]  Totally cut and dry.
[00:02:59.502 --> 00:03:00.062]  To the Senate.
[00:03:00.922 --> 00:03:02.083]  Serious felony crimes.
[00:03:03.663 --> 00:03:04.624]  And said repeatedly.
[00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:05.764]  We aired the clips here.
[00:03:05.804 --> 00:03:06.224]  You saw them.
[00:03:06.744 --> 00:03:07.444]  It was all over the news.
[00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:09.965]  That he didn't know.
[00:03:10.525 --> 00:03:12.486]  And that standards procedure was being followed.
[00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:13.586]  All of that is a lie.
[00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:15.647]  He gave the direct orders.
[00:03:17.528 --> 00:03:18.128]  For what we saw.
[00:03:18.168 --> 00:03:19.048]  And that's how we now know.
[00:03:19.068 --> 00:03:21.189]  90 minutes.
[00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.130]  The Patsy shooter was running around.
[00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.351]  With range finders.
[00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:28.571]  And carrying bags around.
[00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:34.033]  Then he was on top of the roof for 26 minutes.
[00:03:34.153 --> 00:03:35.354]  We have the video, we'll roll.
[00:03:37.536 --> 00:03:41.779]  While Trump's speaking, there he is, crawling along the top of the roof.
[00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:49.506]  As people began to point and yell, there's a man with a gun.
[00:03:49.586 --> 00:03:53.009]  And crowds and police ran away for minutes.
[00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.972]  And no one got Trump off the stage.
[00:03:58.632 --> 00:04:02.916]  I haven't just read books about the Secret Service, read Secret Service guest on like Dan Bongino.
[00:04:02.936 --> 00:04:05.338]  I haven't just watched movies that are based on how they actually operate.
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:16.787]  I have been many times to events when presidents were speaking or Trump was speaking or I was going to meet with Trump or the RNC.
[00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:26.876]  And even if the Secret Service knows you and has already checked you, they are watching you.
[00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:43.149]  And one time I had a 35mm camera around my neck, and I'd already been led into the secure area, the most secure area, and I was sitting there taking pictures, and the Secret Service came up and said, Alex, we're gonna go ahead and check that camera, we just have to check everybody's.
[00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.571]  And they literally took the lens off and looked at the camera to make sure it wasn't one of those fake cameras, a gun.
[00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:53.793]  So the Secret Service doesn't trust me around Trump, because they're not supposed to trust anybody.
[00:04:55.345 --> 00:04:57.447]  Oh, but a guy running around on a roof with a gun.
[00:04:57.467 --> 00:04:58.128]  Everything's fine.
[00:04:58.148 --> 00:04:59.510]  I mean, come on, people.
[00:05:00.351 --> 00:05:01.552]  We've caught them red-handed.
[00:05:01.572 --> 00:05:03.274]  This is huge.
[00:05:05.256 --> 00:05:06.717]  All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:06.737 --> 00:05:07.378]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:07.658 --> 00:05:09.020]  Follow me on Exit Rail Alex Jones.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.221]  Gigantic broadcast today.
[00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:11.583]  Tommy Robinson's coming up.
[00:05:11.623 --> 00:05:12.684]  Other huge guests, stay with us.
[00:05:13.064 --> 00:05:14.906]  It's time to break the globalist trance.
[00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:16.828]  It's time to break your conditioning.
[00:05:17.631 --> 00:05:29.275]  It's Friday, August 2nd, 2024, and we've caught them red-handed in an inside job stand-down directed by the Obama administration through O'Biden, trying to kill Trump 20 days ago.
[00:05:29.355 --> 00:05:34.516]  The whole house of cards has officially come down as more whistleblowers, the highest levels, go public.
[00:05:34.596 --> 00:05:36.537]  The deep state is in deep you-know-what.
[00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.875]  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:38.094]  Well, my friends, thank you for joining us on this live Friday, August 2nd, 2024 transmission.
[00:06:40.396 --> 00:06:42.958]  The globalists are in deep trouble.
[00:06:44.178 --> 00:06:59.649]  For 20 days since they tried to kill Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, I have hammered that if we don't get out in front of this and call it for what it is and say you tried to kill Trump and you're going to try again and just politically annihilate
[00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:07.166]  The Justice Department and the Secret Service and call for their political heads on silver platters.
[00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:12.871]  These arrogant criminals will try it again.
[00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:14.072]  We've got to get them off balance.
[00:07:15.513 --> 00:07:18.096]  We've got to get on their ass like we're a bunch of hunting dogs.
[00:07:20.816 --> 00:07:21.436]  And that's happened.
[00:07:22.237 --> 00:07:28.641]  And there's a lot of members of Congress and senators and governors and people coming out saying you tried to kill him, it was a stand-down.
[00:07:29.302 --> 00:07:32.344]  There's all these senior Secret Service agents and others going public.
[00:07:33.444 --> 00:07:38.988]  Not just all the former top snipers people I've had on in the last 20 days talking about it obviously being a stand-down inside job.
[00:07:39.929 --> 00:07:49.495]  Now you have senior law enforcement on the ground saying it was a stand-down and that they were trying to get the Secret Service to help them and talk to them and that they were told they couldn't.
[00:07:51.087 --> 00:08:18.692]  Now we have multiple whistleblowers that have already directly reached out to Congress with the documents, and I am told now hundreds of other whistleblowers that Senator Josh Hawley and Senator Cruz and others are processing through right now, but the acting Secret Service Director Ronald Roe
[00:08:20.616 --> 00:08:36.707]  100% committed perjury during his testimony this week, when he said basically that standard procedure was followed, and that nothing was cut basically, and that if anything was cut, he didn't know who did it.
[00:08:37.568 --> 00:08:44.292]  There were major protests inside the Trump operation in the last few years over this, including that week, right before what happened in Butler.
[00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:49.316]  There was major protesting within the Secret Service ranks themselves,
[00:08:52.452 --> 00:08:55.714]  They also then gave Trump a tiny detail and gave him the dregs.
[00:08:58.356 --> 00:09:11.685]  And no communication system of the threat assessment team, not just the advance team, but the assessment team that is on the ground integrating communications and deciding what is a threat and what isn't.
[00:09:11.705 --> 00:09:16.549]  And of course, the main place they would be would be on the closest roof to the president, which is where the shooter was.
[00:09:17.985 --> 00:09:20.586]  Their situation room was in the building 50 feet behind it.
[00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:25.109]  It was only 10 feet in the alley, but the window was about 50 feet from where the shooter was.
[00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.690]  That was full of Secret Service agents.
[00:09:30.471 --> 00:09:32.632]  Now, 90 minutes.
[00:09:35.054 --> 00:09:39.336]  The decoy Patsy shooter, Crooks, and I believe he did fire shots, but he was not the only one.
[00:09:39.356 --> 00:09:39.916]  That's obvious.
[00:09:41.277 --> 00:09:41.837]  All my expert
[00:09:44.659 --> 00:09:45.880]  Contacts have concurred.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.240]  You've heard some of them on the show.
[00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:51.923]  One of them, the top sniper, longest shot, 2.2 miles.
[00:09:53.264 --> 00:09:55.765]  Saying 100% instantly saw it, total standout.
[00:09:56.325 --> 00:09:57.006]  The minute he saw it.
[00:10:00.107 --> 00:10:04.369]  And that's what all my other sources have said, including people that are on the FBI hostage rescue team.
[00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.751]  Which is some of the best shooters in the world.
[00:10:07.511 --> 00:10:08.171]  Former military.
[00:10:09.992 --> 00:10:12.574]  So this is the default standout.
[00:10:13.404 --> 00:10:19.286]  This is the equivalent of you have a newborn baby, and you walk over to your pool, and you throw it in the water, and you go inside and watch a football game.
[00:10:19.506 --> 00:10:20.027]  The baby's dead.
[00:10:20.227 --> 00:10:20.727]  Baby's gonna die.
[00:10:21.767 --> 00:10:30.351]  It is not negligence, it is deliberate negligence, bare minimum criminal negligence.
[00:10:32.371 --> 00:10:33.952]  Criminal negligence.
[00:10:35.873 --> 00:10:36.313]  It'd be like,
[00:10:38.624 --> 00:10:47.108]  Giving a bunch of four-year-olds playing in your backyard a box of hand grenades and opening the box for them and handing them hand grenades and showing them how to pull the pins out and then going inside.
[00:10:48.709 --> 00:10:49.749]  Now that's the bare minimum.
[00:10:52.971 --> 00:10:54.251]  They thought Trump would be dead.
[00:10:54.692 --> 00:10:58.253]  They would have obviously staged some false flags and blamed Trump supporters, probably even gotten Biden.
[00:10:58.293 --> 00:10:59.594]  We'd be under martial law right now.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.103]  They had their internet kill switch in place, but by the grace of God, they didn't kill him.
[00:11:06.143 --> 00:11:08.585]  And so now, they have got big problems.
[00:11:08.665 --> 00:11:10.286]  And Biden can barely talk.
[00:11:10.347 --> 00:11:14.190]  Kamala can barely talk, since they inserted her as the leader.
[00:11:16.532 --> 00:11:18.894]  Selected her a week and a half ago.
[00:11:18.954 --> 00:11:21.035]  She's not talked to the press.
[00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:24.378]  She talked to the press last night, and it was complete gibberish, as usual.
[00:11:25.859 --> 00:11:27.301]  Repeating words over and over again.
[00:11:27.361 --> 00:11:28.602]  The woman is completely insane.
[00:11:30.396 --> 00:11:32.957]  Reportedly behind the scenes, completely vicious, of course.
[00:11:35.158 --> 00:11:40.320]  So that's where we are, and we're gonna go walking through all of this today, and there's so much other insane news.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.480]  We got some big guests coming on.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:48.023]  Tommy Robinson, who just got arrested for leading tens of thousands in a peaceful protest in England, arrested for terrorism.
[00:11:48.663 --> 00:11:51.124]  Police said protesting open borders is terror.
[00:11:52.464 --> 00:11:57.046]  The Prime Minister's come out and defended the young black illegal alien that stabbed and killed three young children.
[00:11:58.993 --> 00:12:02.095]  And said that basically they're the bad people.
[00:12:03.936 --> 00:12:05.537]  It's just completely over the top.
[00:12:06.898 --> 00:12:10.601]  Major investigation started in Congress with the latest Google election meddling.
[00:12:13.723 --> 00:12:15.123]  Massive news on the border.
[00:12:16.184 --> 00:12:20.467]  Huge news on the economy, obviously, with the stock market and these job numbers that are so bad coming out.
[00:12:21.768 --> 00:12:22.969]  Thanks to Gavin Newsom.
[00:12:23.973 --> 00:12:25.634]  The biggest business booster for Texas.
[00:12:26.134 --> 00:12:27.195]  Our great state's ever seen.
[00:12:27.255 --> 00:12:27.815]  Chevron.
[00:12:27.835 --> 00:12:29.616]  That's Standard Oil, folks.
[00:12:29.656 --> 00:12:31.778]  That's Rockefeller's.
[00:12:31.798 --> 00:12:33.739]  Is coming to Tejas.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.382]  That will bring hundreds of billions of dollars in the next few years to the state.
[00:12:40.443 --> 00:12:41.743]  So that exodus continues.
[00:12:42.444 --> 00:12:44.105]  Biden regime officially recognizes
[00:12:45.526 --> 00:12:52.071]  Gonzalez is the victor of the legitimate winner of the recently concluded Venezuelan election due to election fraud.
[00:12:52.612 --> 00:12:54.954]  They've gone and done massive independent exit polls.
[00:12:55.774 --> 00:13:04.382]  Between 63 and 65% of the country that voted, voted for Gonzalez and not for the current dictator.
[00:13:06.083 --> 00:13:10.727]  So we have all of that news on Maduro, who's holed up in his
[00:13:12.128 --> 00:13:19.811]  Building his palace with the anti-terrorism police as the rest of the country is taken away from him.
[00:13:20.912 --> 00:13:23.253]  I think he's gone within a month, maybe sooner.
[00:13:25.633 --> 00:13:33.517]  We have so much more, obviously, to be going over Kamala Harris' record and more, but it's very important for me to do this.
[00:13:34.837 --> 00:13:39.739]  It's very important for you to do this, in my opinion, my humble opinion.
[00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:41.560]  I think you're going to agree with me.
[00:13:43.078 --> 00:13:45.759]  And when I say this, this is not me lecturing you.
[00:13:46.359 --> 00:13:55.102]  I want listeners to understand, so much of the broadcast is my own internal dialogue of what I'm thinking about, and what my guests are thinking about, what callers are thinking about, and we're trying to suss this out.
[00:13:56.362 --> 00:14:08.486]  But personally, I've talked about how urgent a situation we're in to realize the edge of this economic, cultural, military cliff for them.
[00:14:11.494 --> 00:14:28.581]  And what the different scenarios are if they kill Trump, and the different false flags they're planning, and what we're facing, and just how nail-biting and suspense-filled this time we're in.
[00:14:28.621 --> 00:14:30.102]  Because we have a normalcy bias.
[00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:30.962]  I have one as well.
[00:14:32.383 --> 00:14:34.744]  I've been on the air over 30 years, and I've seen a lot.
[00:14:36.404 --> 00:14:40.146]  And it's important to just pull back and very coldly look at the situation,
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:52.390]  And on a scale of 1 to 10, previous crises that this country's been in, in the last 100 years, approached a 5 or a 6.
[00:14:54.312 --> 00:14:57.294]  We're at about a 7 or 8 right now, and the potential is to go to 10.
[00:14:58.692 --> 00:15:09.699]  So, and it's not just me, it's all the mainline analysts, the Rand Corporation, the Atomic Scientists Association, the Russians, the Chinese, all their analysts, the Pentagon analysts.
[00:15:10.059 --> 00:15:14.582]  There's a new congressional report on Pentagon war games that were classified.
[00:15:14.602 --> 00:15:22.868]  The United States will decisively lose a war with Russia and China conventionally, and we'll lose a nuclear war as well.
[00:15:23.348 --> 00:15:24.669]  Hands down, we'll lose.
[00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.951]  Now, it'll be a Pyrrhic victory for China and Russia.
[00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:32.772]  There'll be a molten slag heap show.
[00:15:32.832 --> 00:15:34.833]  It's like they say in war games, the great movie in the 80s.
[00:15:36.614 --> 00:15:37.654]  What a strange game.
[00:15:38.614 --> 00:15:40.635]  The only way to win is not to play.
[00:15:41.395 --> 00:15:42.016]  Exactly!
[00:15:42.036 --> 00:15:43.356]  I don't play Russian Roulette.
[00:15:43.396 --> 00:15:44.577]  That's not a very fun game.
[00:15:46.638 --> 00:15:48.438]  I got enough problems in my life.
[00:15:48.458 --> 00:15:49.859]  I got plenty of adrenaline.
[00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:55.901]  I don't need to have a six-cylinder revolver and put one bullet in it and spin it and bet money and pull the trigger.
[00:15:56.461 --> 00:15:57.102]  I don't like that.
[00:15:58.067 --> 00:15:59.788]  I will risk my life for things that matter.
[00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.191]  My life, my family's life, it's all connected to you.
[00:16:04.231 --> 00:16:05.832]  If you don't have a great life, I'm not going to have a great life.
[00:16:07.153 --> 00:16:10.876]  Yeah, I'll roll the dice and play Russian Roulette to fight the new world order because I have to.
[00:16:12.717 --> 00:16:22.583]  But you look at these disconnected puppet elite, and then even their controllers, the minions of the globalists are a reflection of the globalists.
[00:16:25.086 --> 00:16:35.089]  Are a bunch of pedophile devil worshippers, because there's multi-generational wealth, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 20 generations in the case of people like Prince Charles, King Charles.
[00:16:36.029 --> 00:16:41.391]  And just to a man, they're pedophiles, they're devil worshippers, it's what they're born into.
[00:16:43.231 --> 00:16:45.112]  They're just horrible, disgusting people.
[00:16:46.201 --> 00:16:55.152]  And they are disconnected from reality, they're under Satan's control, and they are maneuvering the planet towards total, absolute destruction.
[00:16:58.596 --> 00:16:59.357]  And that's where we're at.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.144]  So it's very important for all the people that work for corporations and governments
[00:17:06.209 --> 00:17:13.014]  That say, well if I speak up or I say no or I stick my head up above the parapet, I'm gonna get fired or somebody's gonna come after me.
[00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:16.837]  Listen to me, in a cost-benefit analysis, even if you're a sociopath.
[00:17:17.458 --> 00:17:18.519]  Talk to the sociopaths out there.
[00:17:19.179 --> 00:17:20.500]  Or the sellouts, the mercenaries.
[00:17:23.643 --> 00:17:27.085]  100% it's worse to go along with this craziness.
[00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:30.428]  The only way out is speaking up against it and fighting it.
[00:17:31.423 --> 00:17:37.626]  And for those of us like Trump and myself and Tucker Carlson that are willing to go all the way, that's because we understand this.
[00:17:37.666 --> 00:17:43.309]  And Elon Musk now, he knows, he said we're going to collapse civilization and blow everything up if you keep cutting off resources.
[00:17:43.329 --> 00:17:50.472]  He says we need fossil fuels, we need fertilizers, sure we should bridge to new technologies, but that's 50 years away until we can process out of this.
[00:17:50.792 --> 00:17:51.492]  You got to stop.
[00:17:51.972 --> 00:17:57.095]  He's looked at every number and he said exactly what I've said and I've interviewed him and he agrees.
[00:17:58.991 --> 00:18:00.331]  They will destroy the Earth.
[00:18:00.471 --> 00:18:02.372]  They will get everybody killed.
[00:18:03.552 --> 00:18:19.377]  And so I can cover all these factoids, interesting little news items, and they're officially swimming in feces at the Olympics, and, you know, all, it's, it's, it's, it's, and I can play word salad Kamala clips, and I can show you crime videos, and illegal aliens, and, you know, rampaging car chases every day.
[00:18:19.397 --> 00:18:20.577]  There's like five new videos.
[00:18:21.778 --> 00:18:26.059]  And that's all really interesting, and, you know, it's, it's entertaining and horrifying.
[00:18:28.046 --> 00:18:29.766]  But all that's the little fear porn.
[00:18:31.427 --> 00:18:35.648]  I'm not selling fear porn, I'm selling wake-up calls to turn this around.
[00:18:38.089 --> 00:18:44.610]  So the bureaucracy loves having lunatic puppets in there that can take the blame and just be a great distraction.
[00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.731]  But I've studied the people managing them, and they're just as bad.
[00:18:48.971 --> 00:18:50.532]  And so it's basically like this.
[00:18:52.072 --> 00:18:54.973]  We have a cultural runaway train going on right now.
[00:18:57.453 --> 00:18:59.195]  A societal runaway train.
[00:19:00.976 --> 00:19:07.141]  And not just the establishment, and the banks, and the corporations, and the media, and the government, but it's everywhere.
[00:19:07.161 --> 00:19:17.028]  You've got a bunch of go-along, get-along preachers, and a bunch of go-along, get-along academics, and everybody just nods to the political correctness and thinks, well, we'll just keep our heads down.
[00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:20.311]  If you keep doing that, we're all dead.
[00:19:21.412 --> 00:19:24.074]  And I don't think anybody who looks at the evidence can disagree with that.
[00:19:25.615 --> 00:19:33.259]  I mean, I could see while they were running the gas out of the world and the country and things were still prosperous that people were like, you know what?
[00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:34.260]  I'm not very moral.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:34.920]  I don't care.
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.861]  I'm not going to be engaged or informed.
[00:19:36.881 --> 00:19:37.682]  I'm not going to inform others.
[00:19:38.142 --> 00:19:40.403]  I'm just going to enjoy myself as a nihilist.
[00:19:41.524 --> 00:19:41.884]  Okay.
[00:19:44.545 --> 00:19:46.787]  Well, we're not in that season anymore.
[00:19:48.728 --> 00:19:52.190]  You can party in the summertime or if you live in the
[00:19:54.864 --> 00:19:58.085]  Equatorial regions, and it's not overpopulated, because some areas are.
[00:19:58.406 --> 00:19:59.926]  You've got plenty of food just growing on trees.
[00:20:00.146 --> 00:20:01.067]  You can lay around all day.
[00:20:03.908 --> 00:20:11.331]  But when you live in the north, and the winter comes and lasts four months and gets 50 below zero, you've got to put food ahead.
[00:20:11.351 --> 00:20:13.192]  You've got to get prepared.
[00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:18.114]  You've got to process furs and get clothing and stockpile firewood.
[00:20:18.235 --> 00:20:21.076]  And I use that analogy of Ice Age culture.
[00:20:22.657 --> 00:20:24.319]  Versus equatorial culture.
[00:20:24.919 --> 00:20:31.506]  And I would liken the globalist culture to kind of laying around enjoying themselves while the rest of the world collapses.
[00:20:32.647 --> 00:20:35.250]  And I'm not geographically even saying that's the equator.
[00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:40.895]  I'm using the analogy of somebody that lives close to the Arctic Circle versus somebody historically that doesn't.
[00:20:42.977 --> 00:20:45.220]  Politically, the winner is here.
[00:20:46.457 --> 00:20:48.618]  And most people have not gotten ready for this.
[00:20:48.718 --> 00:20:51.819]  And so we're not sunshine patriots, we're winter soldiers.
[00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:54.200]  So the analogy continues on into that area.
[00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.361]  You know what a sunshine patriot is?
[00:20:59.002 --> 00:21:00.262]  Versus a winter soldier?
[00:21:01.363 --> 00:21:03.923]  Sunshine patriots are always happy to be on a bandwagon.
[00:21:04.304 --> 00:21:08.485]  They're always happy to, you know, act like they care and virtue signal.
[00:21:08.825 --> 00:21:13.087]  But the winter soldier fights when their shoes have fallen apart.
[00:21:14.397 --> 00:21:17.520]  You know, back in the old days, the Revolutionary War, they had leather shoes.
[00:21:18.001 --> 00:21:22.545]  And in the freezing cold, marching hundreds of miles a month, their shoes would disintegrate.
[00:21:23.306 --> 00:21:26.509]  And they would have to tie clothing onto their feet.
[00:21:26.629 --> 00:21:38.181]  And when, early in the war, when George Washington's small group of troops went to tie Kondaroga, these big giant British guns, the biggest guns in the Western Hemisphere,
[00:21:40.168 --> 00:21:45.350]  Gigantic huge cannons, and they hauled them a massive distance.
[00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:46.150]  I forget how many miles.
[00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:46.611]  Guys, look up.
[00:21:46.871 --> 00:21:51.412]  How far were the guns of Ticonderoga drug through the snow by George Washington's troops?
[00:21:51.673 --> 00:21:52.413]  Just a few hundred of them.
[00:21:53.373 --> 00:22:02.857]  And the last 10 miles or so, you go to the exact story, there was blood, just a solid red blood.
[00:22:06.795 --> 00:22:18.938]  In the snow, in deep winter, because their shoes, from the weight of dragging those cannons, something like 70 miles, some ridiculous number, look it up, how far the revolutionary troops dragged the guns of Ticonderoga.
[00:22:19.278 --> 00:22:24.059]  When they got there, 300 miles, see my memory was just saying 70, 300 miles, and none of them had shoes.
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:29.160]  We're good to go.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:23:08.787]  And by the time they got there, none of them had shoes, but they had the prize that they'd taken that fortress, and they'd killed the British troops, and they'd hauled those guns down off the mountain, and they were gonna drag those sons of bitches, those men had the hearts of huskies, until they died, and some did die hauling those guns as a victory.
[00:23:10.828 --> 00:23:13.489]  Nobody had a whip popping them, nobody had to tell them to do it.
[00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:16.030]  They were just told, go destroy the guns.
[00:23:17.051 --> 00:23:17.651]  Memory serves.
[00:23:17.691 --> 00:23:18.392]  I've read the story.
[00:23:18.412 --> 00:23:20.012]  I've read books about it, you know, 20 years ago.
[00:23:21.573 --> 00:23:23.354]  But they said, no, we're not destroying these guns.
[00:23:23.414 --> 00:23:24.934]  We're hauling these guns back.
[00:23:25.214 --> 00:23:26.915]  Guys, pull up the guns at Ticonderoga.
[00:23:27.395 --> 00:23:30.937]  I think they melted them down and made smaller guns, but just comparative guns.
[00:23:30.957 --> 00:23:35.479]  I mean, we're talking, you know, cannons like, I think, 40-something feet long.
[00:23:35.499 --> 00:23:38.900]  I mean, huge, huge giant iron cannons.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.040]  Drug.
[00:23:41.641 --> 00:23:45.163]  I should reread on that and actually do a report that's accurate because I'm going from vague memory.
[00:23:45.703 --> 00:23:45.903]  So,
[00:23:48.595 --> 00:23:49.655]  That's what we're talking about.
[00:23:51.996 --> 00:23:53.177]  Now, that's who we come from.
[00:23:54.957 --> 00:23:56.358]  The guns of Ty Conderoga.
[00:23:58.119 --> 00:23:59.719]  And that's your real heritage, folks.
[00:23:59.779 --> 00:24:01.540]  So, those are winter soldiers.
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.581]  I'll be honest with you.
[00:24:05.822 --> 00:24:07.322]  I'm not as tough as those guys are.
[00:24:11.344 --> 00:24:17.026]  You think our, quote, best special ops troops today, with no shoes, could drag guns 300 miles through the snow?
[00:24:18.561 --> 00:24:21.604]  And again, something like the last hundred or so, they had almost none of them had shoes.
[00:24:21.804 --> 00:24:23.125]  By the end, none of them had shoes.
[00:24:24.746 --> 00:24:26.368]  And I don't want to spend the whole show on this.
[00:24:26.688 --> 00:24:36.656]  I'm going to move on to the stand-down of Secret Service, all confirmed, and how we've got to let that burn into us that we knew it day one, 20 days ago, and now it's all confirmed.
[00:24:37.797 --> 00:24:46.805]  I don't think I could pull a giant steel gun five miles through the jagged, icy road with no shoes.
[00:24:48.663 --> 00:24:49.064]  300 miles.
[00:24:50.905 --> 00:24:51.825]  100 or so with no shoes.
[00:24:55.648 --> 00:24:57.249]  Again, just let it sink in.
[00:24:58.570 --> 00:24:59.551]  Let it sink in.
[00:25:00.051 --> 00:25:01.512]  How tough our ancestors were.
[00:25:05.855 --> 00:25:07.756]  They wanted to haul those guns 300 miles.
[00:25:08.056 --> 00:25:09.617]  They wanted to do something badass.
[00:25:09.877 --> 00:25:10.918]  They wanted to be tough.
[00:25:11.178 --> 00:25:12.179]  They wanted to be strong.
[00:25:12.359 --> 00:25:15.161]  They wanted to break the back of an empire never been defeated, and they did.
[00:25:16.701 --> 00:25:18.623]  And you look at Trump's strength and his stamina.
[00:25:18.643 --> 00:25:25.650]  Yeah, they shot 12 and 18 pound cannonballs.
[00:25:27.752 --> 00:25:29.854]  Old snow that weighed 5,000 pounds.
[00:25:32.117 --> 00:25:33.298]  And giant mortar guns.
[00:25:35.939 --> 00:25:38.762]  So that's the point, and I'm gonna move on now.
[00:25:38.782 --> 00:25:41.104]  We're gonna go to break, and I'm gonna come back and get into the big news.
[00:25:41.164 --> 00:25:42.586]  But they tried to kill him.
[00:25:42.706 --> 00:25:43.967]  They're going to try to do it again.
[00:25:44.127 --> 00:25:45.849]  If they do it, all hell's gonna break loose.
[00:25:46.229 --> 00:25:50.754]  The different scenarios go from horrible to absolutely insane and Armageddon level.
[00:25:52.736 --> 00:25:54.418]  And this is where we are.
[00:25:56.317 --> 00:25:59.118]  And so we need to continue to be pissed off and angry.
[00:25:59.298 --> 00:26:00.878]  They want us to forget what they tried to do.
[00:26:01.118 --> 00:26:02.198]  They want us just to go away.
[00:26:02.578 --> 00:26:04.159]  No, we need maximum pressure.
[00:26:04.459 --> 00:26:17.622]  We need to remove the new head of the Secret Service, and we need to impeach Merrick Garland, who you know gave the orders, and Alexander Mayorkas, Alejandro Mayorkas.
[00:26:19.802 --> 00:26:21.542]  These are evil criminals, folks.
[00:26:22.703 --> 00:26:24.023]  They didn't just take a shot at Trump.
[00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:27.451]  They took a shot at you.
[00:26:28.892 --> 00:26:29.953]  And they're a bunch of scum.
[00:26:29.973 --> 00:26:31.334]  And this guy's a big Democrat.
[00:26:31.674 --> 00:26:32.815]  He's always worked for Democrats.
[00:26:33.276 --> 00:26:34.517]  He is a slimebag.
[00:26:36.358 --> 00:26:37.700]  He is an enemy of your family.
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.061]  He's an enemy of this country.
[00:26:39.101 --> 00:26:40.342]  He tried to kill our president.
[00:26:41.463 --> 00:26:44.646]  I'll guarantee you, they were running that operation, had that guy wound up.
[00:26:45.486 --> 00:26:47.068]  I would imagine he probably gave the orders.
[00:26:50.431 --> 00:26:50.971]  Guaranteed.
[00:26:51.231 --> 00:26:51.632]  You know it.
[00:26:52.252 --> 00:26:54.114]  Well, guess what you missed, you piece of shit?
[00:26:59.056 --> 00:27:01.898]  So, that's where we are.
[00:27:01.998 --> 00:27:03.279]  Well, courage is contagious.
[00:27:03.319 --> 00:27:04.420]  Trump's courage is amazing.
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.202]  Our listeners' courage in the past, and your support's been amazing.
[00:27:07.782 --> 00:27:10.404]  But now is the time to redouble your efforts.
[00:27:10.484 --> 00:27:16.749]  I know we've been fighting forever, and Infowars has barely survived many, many times, and people kind of get this attitude, oh, well, it'll always be there.
[00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:17.309]  No, it won't.
[00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:19.691]  And Trump won't always be there.
[00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:27.533]  We have to take this country back culturally and take the world back culturally and spiritually, and we have to get hardcore about the situation.
[00:27:27.553 --> 00:27:33.499]  I'm going to get a deep dive on the Secret Service, confirm a stand-down inside job, and what's going to happen next straight ahead.
[00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:37.103]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we have huge economic news and more coming up today.
[00:27:37.744 --> 00:27:41.168]  Please follow us on X at RealAlexJones and check out InfoWars.com.
[00:27:41.568 --> 00:27:46.872]  So, there's the InfoWars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:27:47.032 --> 00:27:54.397]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's salt palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[00:27:54.838 --> 00:27:58.460]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:27:59.801]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[00:27:59.821 --> 00:28:09.888]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWars MD.
[00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:14.661]  Alright, I'm gonna do the deep dive now on the absolute treason.
[00:28:16.022 --> 00:28:17.644]  That's not just a word I'm saying, this happened.
[00:28:18.064 --> 00:28:39.660]  By the deep state, ordering the stand-down at every level of the Secret Service, and then lying to Congress about it, and now all these high-level whistleblowers, from the head of the police there, locally, to high-level Secret Service, are saying, no, the acting director, Ronald Rowe, ordered the stand-down himself, and he told Congress there wasn't a stand-down, and said he didn't know who gave the orders.
[00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:45.863]  So they got rid of the puppet lady, who I said looked and acted like a puppet, and they put the real guy in.
[00:28:45.883 --> 00:28:50.006]  And he's the number one suspect, not just standing down, but running the attack.
[00:28:50.887 --> 00:28:57.952]  He probably met with Mayorkas, they planned it out, they had their wind-up assassin ready, just like the FBI tried with Governor Whitmer, but failed.
[00:28:59.233 --> 00:28:59.674]  I'll say it.
[00:29:01.187 --> 00:29:10.049]  I believe there is a very good chance, and there's enough to criminally investigate him, clearly, and to get everybody involved and find out where he was, where he went.
[00:29:10.409 --> 00:29:12.970]  He should have his phone grabbed right now.
[00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:14.411]  There should be warrants getting out.
[00:29:14.451 --> 00:29:24.393]  But of course, the Justice Department that's running all of this, and Mayorkas, who's doing the giant child trafficking, they're the ones in charge of the law enforcement, so that's not going to happen.
[00:29:25.613 --> 00:29:27.274]  And so they've got a free hand to try to do it again.
[00:29:30.905 --> 00:29:38.891]  In fact, I would bet my life he was in on the actual planning of the operation with the FBI and the CIA.
[00:29:40.232 --> 00:29:45.376]  You just look at him and everything he's done and he's lying and deliberately ordering the stand down.
[00:29:49.839 --> 00:29:52.682]  Look at this guy, just look at that sack of filth.
[00:29:53.342 --> 00:29:56.905]  You look at his record, he works for every deep state top Democrat you can imagine.
[00:29:58.649 --> 00:29:59.889]  That man hates America.
[00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:01.450]  That man hates your family.
[00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:06.252]  That man tried to kill our president by bare minimum criminal negligence.
[00:30:06.512 --> 00:30:08.873]  And it's time to stop bowing down to this trash.
[00:30:11.154 --> 00:30:14.835]  And this trash all get together and think they're invincible, full of a bunch of hubris.
[00:30:17.536 --> 00:30:18.076]  And chutzpah!
[00:30:18.937 --> 00:30:20.377]  They're gonna get us all killed!
[00:30:21.838 --> 00:30:24.979]  What do you idiots think would happen if you'd have killed Trump, you morons?
[00:30:26.359 --> 00:30:27.640]  You've taken everybody's
[00:30:28.874 --> 00:30:30.095]  Restraint is weakness?
[00:30:30.555 --> 00:30:36.557]  No, it's because those of us that actually work and live in the real world understand you're playing with fire, fool!
[00:30:37.938 --> 00:30:41.800]  We want to fix things peacefully, but you're hell-bent on not letting that happen, aren't you?
[00:30:44.441 --> 00:30:47.783]  So you tried to blow our president's head off, you sack of crap!
[00:30:49.263 --> 00:30:55.246]  Because you know you can't beat him, and you know he's gonna win, despite all your fraud, all your illegal aliens publicly voting and bragging about it.
[00:30:57.967 --> 00:31:03.051]  Just like Maduro thinks he just gets to run everything and just to ignore the people.
[00:31:05.293 --> 00:31:13.039]  All right, Waters did a great job on Fox, too, in a condensed report on this, and I'll take it to the next level after we play this report.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:13.440]  Here it is.
[00:31:14.801 --> 00:31:21.887]  The acting director of the Secret Service told Congress under oath that his agency didn't cut resources from Trump's detail.
[00:31:23.083 --> 00:31:26.924]  If you're talking about Butler, Pennsylvania, all assets requested were approved.
[00:31:27.024 --> 00:31:43.290]  If you're talking about the media reporting of assets requested, there were times when assets were unavailable and not able to be filled, and those gaps were staffed with state and local law enforcement tactical assets.
[00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:44.770]  That's a lie.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.303]  Yeah, and we have the whistleblowers, we have the documents that we already know, and it's all coming out.
[00:31:50.664 --> 00:31:52.085]  They had plenty of secret service.
[00:31:52.526 --> 00:32:04.658]  He deliberately ordered even the normal bare minimum off, and the special team that sits up on the closest, highest building, that's where they were, is where Crook shot from, should have been there, where they were nesting.
[00:32:08.342 --> 00:32:09.043]  This is incredible.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:14.963]  And then he deliberately ordered that team, and we have the names of it all right here, not to be there.
[00:32:15.363 --> 00:32:16.844]  And there was Secret Service protesting.
[00:32:16.864 --> 00:32:19.905]  I want to be clear, the average Secret Service person's not bad.
[00:32:20.485 --> 00:32:21.186]  They're not the enemy.
[00:32:21.726 --> 00:32:24.487]  I'd say, on average, they're probably just as patriotic as anybody or more.
[00:32:25.288 --> 00:32:26.769]  And they're the reason we have whistleblowers from them.
[00:32:27.149 --> 00:32:34.833]  But the leadership are political globalists that think they can just do all this through their wind-up toys like Crooks, and we don't know.
[00:32:37.745 --> 00:32:39.651]  And the reports are coming out everywhere Trump goes.
[00:32:39.671 --> 00:32:41.998]  They're leaving all the doors open, all the gates open.
[00:32:42.018 --> 00:32:43.823]  They're not putting security anywhere.
[00:32:44.687 --> 00:32:50.710]  They're telling the police where to go and what to do, but they're not giving the police even contact points and no team to talk to.
[00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:51.790]  So they're all like, what do we do?
[00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:52.751]  There's a guy with a gun on the roof.
[00:32:52.951 --> 00:32:54.271]  Well, the Secret Service won't answer.
[00:32:54.851 --> 00:32:59.233]  Well, the cops should have taken matters into their own hand and run up on the stage and said, Trump's got to get off the stage.
[00:32:59.734 --> 00:33:01.094]  And Trump said if he'd have been told, he wouldn't.
[00:33:01.294 --> 00:33:04.756]  Instead, for 90 minutes, this guy's waiting for Trump to come out.
[00:33:05.276 --> 00:33:09.018]  Soon as Trump comes out, he goes up on the roof and gets up there with a gun.
[00:33:09.038 --> 00:33:10.218]  Everybody's like, he's got a gun!
[00:33:10.238 --> 00:33:11.039]  He's got a gun!
[00:33:11.059 --> 00:33:11.719]  He's got a gun!
[00:33:12.816 --> 00:33:14.016]  And you hear the Jeopardy music.
[00:33:14.477 --> 00:33:15.937]  Do-do-do-do-do.
[00:33:16.257 --> 00:33:17.698]  Do-do-do-do-do-do.
[00:33:18.058 --> 00:33:20.179]  On and on and on and on and on and on and on!
[00:33:26.321 --> 00:33:27.782]  They're playing with fire, folks!
[00:33:28.162 --> 00:33:30.503]  And everything the Globalists touch is not working anymore, is it?
[00:33:31.023 --> 00:33:31.984]  They should know to give up.
[00:33:34.064 --> 00:33:34.445]  They're not.
[00:33:36.765 --> 00:33:37.746]  Alright, back to Waters.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:42.310]  If you're talking about Butler, Pennsylvania, all assets requested were approved.
[00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:58.638]  If you're talking about the media reporting of assets requested, there were times when assets were unavailable and not able to be filled, and those gaps were staffed with state and local law enforcement tactical assets.
[00:33:59.338 --> 00:34:00.059]  That's a lie.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.041]  Period.
[00:34:01.442 --> 00:34:03.505]  And lying to Congress is a felony.
[00:34:04.226 --> 00:34:14.382]  A Secret Service whistleblower is telling Senator Hawley that that guy personally directed that Secret Service agents who do threat assessments at events be cut.
[00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:25.435]  The whistleblower says those agents should have been at Trump's butler rally doing threat assessments, and they were cut by that Secret Service director, Ronald Roe.
[00:34:26.476 --> 00:34:34.962]  Some of these Secret Service threat assessment agents had been warning about security problems for months leading up to the butler rally, but were ignored.
[00:34:36.564 --> 00:34:36.844]  Why?
[00:34:38.005 --> 00:34:43.249]  If those agents were at the butler rally, Crooks would have been in cuffs the second he was spotted with the rangefinder.
[00:34:44.383 --> 00:34:53.055]  Not only did Secret Service cut these special agents for Trump's butler rally, the Secret Service hasn't even called the locals who were providing backup that day.
[00:34:54.217 --> 00:34:59.645]  Secret Service has never talked to any of our people.
[00:35:00.774 --> 00:35:11.583]  Either before the rally that day or to this moment has ever talked to us in regards to what our actions were that day.
[00:35:11.783 --> 00:35:16.267]  Secret Service has not talked to us at all about the incident.
[00:35:17.068 --> 00:35:19.050]  You've not talked directly to the Secret Service?
[00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:23.653]  Then Director Tito, Acting Director Ronald Rowe, they've not reached out to you?
[00:35:23.693 --> 00:35:24.334]  Neither one of them?
[00:35:24.934 --> 00:35:25.355]  None of them.
[00:35:26.764 --> 00:35:29.885]  They're doing an investigation into an attempted assassination.
[00:35:30.485 --> 00:35:32.706]  And the Secret Service hasn't even called the locals.
[00:35:33.346 --> 00:35:34.626]  Not even out of curiosity.
[00:35:34.786 --> 00:35:36.447]  Like, what the hell happened, guys?
[00:35:37.927 --> 00:35:39.908]  That's evidence of a cover-up.
[00:35:41.448 --> 00:35:44.689]  Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy joins me now.
[00:35:44.709 --> 00:35:46.010]  Vivek, another lie.
[00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:49.091]  Lie after lie after lie.
[00:35:49.331 --> 00:35:49.631]  Why?
[00:35:52.082 --> 00:35:54.463]  This has become muscle memory for the federal government, Jesse.
[00:35:54.683 --> 00:35:58.125]  This is a pattern that needs to end at some point in history.
[00:35:58.505 --> 00:36:00.046]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[00:36:00.566 --> 00:36:01.847]  We got to find the Vivek interviews.
[00:36:01.867 --> 00:36:02.827]  We got to get him back on.
[00:36:04.108 --> 00:36:08.310]  He predicted with me probably 10 times that they are going to try to kill Trump.
[00:36:10.151 --> 00:36:10.811]  And now it's happened.
[00:36:11.652 --> 00:36:20.636]  But again, they don't want any record and they're only there still trying to cover up the Butler site still and trying to keep senators off the site because they know they ordered a standout.
[00:36:22.165 --> 00:36:22.485]  I don't know.
[00:36:45.871 --> 00:36:47.751]  Local police have to take matters in their own hands.
[00:36:48.391 --> 00:36:58.453]  When I was at January 6th, and Trump had a stage behind the Capitol up by the Supreme Court, and I get there and I see the setup, I said, don't go in, but my bullhorn only went out a couple hundred yards, and I got thousands to not go in.
[00:36:58.713 --> 00:36:59.734]  But I did what I was supposed to.
[00:37:00.794 --> 00:37:12.456]  And if I'd have been there, and I saw the dude on the roof with a gun, I wouldn't run away, I would run up to the stage, and I'd scream, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, and Trump would have been taken off.
[00:37:14.033 --> 00:37:14.733]  They would have spun it.
[00:37:15.093 --> 00:37:17.794]  Oh, Alex Jones causes a fire in a theater, you know.
[00:37:17.874 --> 00:37:18.534]  Well, I don't care.
[00:37:18.574 --> 00:37:19.854]  They wouldn't have been able to kill Trump.
[00:37:21.075 --> 00:37:43.260]  So, if you're at a Trump rally, I don't care if you're selling hot dogs or t-shirts, or you're an usher, or you're an attendee, or you're a police officer, and you see some son of a bitch crawling around on the roof with a gun, and he's not even in a police uniform, you start screaming, gun, gun, gun, which they did, but that was in the back of the crowd and over by the fence.
[00:37:44.821 --> 00:37:50.444]  I mean, again, folks, you've got people screaming, man on the roof for minutes and minutes and minutes and minutes, man with a gun and nothing's done.
[00:37:50.764 --> 00:37:52.324]  This is not beyond a stand down.
[00:37:52.344 --> 00:37:54.325]  This is an inside job.
[00:37:54.946 --> 00:37:59.788]  And I get enraged when I look at the picture of this sack of garbage.
[00:38:02.029 --> 00:38:02.909]  Ronald Rowe.
[00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.731]  And we played the clips held live and we played them on air.
[00:38:07.751 --> 00:38:08.412]  We got to find him.
[00:38:10.893 --> 00:38:11.233]  He's like,
[00:38:13.247 --> 00:38:15.448]  It was the questioning of Senator Cruz of him.
[00:38:15.468 --> 00:38:18.911]  He goes, OK, what does Biden get?
[00:38:19.031 --> 00:38:20.432]  2X, 3X, 5X, 10X?
[00:38:21.333 --> 00:38:23.774]  Who ordered them to make it whatever X it was?
[00:38:23.794 --> 00:38:24.395]  Well, I don't know.
[00:38:24.915 --> 00:38:25.355]  I don't know.
[00:38:25.416 --> 00:38:26.236]  That's the big lie.
[00:38:26.536 --> 00:38:30.099]  He told Ted Cruz, I don't know, over and over again.
[00:38:30.139 --> 00:38:30.539]  We played it.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.440]  When was it live?
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:31.860]  Tuesday?
[00:38:33.061 --> 00:38:35.863]  We aired it over and over again.
[00:38:35.903 --> 00:38:37.705]  He probably aired it three times.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.041]  And I said, that's a damn lie.
[00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:41.901]  I bet he's the one in charge.
[00:38:42.402 --> 00:38:43.282]  I bet he ordered it.
[00:38:43.522 --> 00:38:44.142]  And you know what?
[00:38:44.683 --> 00:38:45.063]  It is!
[00:38:45.203 --> 00:38:46.383]  He was in charge!
[00:38:48.204 --> 00:38:50.685]  They're like, oh, the woman was just a puppet.
[00:38:50.705 --> 00:38:51.746]  She didn't know what to say.
[00:38:52.106 --> 00:38:53.327]  Send in the manager.
[00:38:53.527 --> 00:38:56.708]  He'll be able to steer these idiots, you know, off the trail.
[00:38:59.069 --> 00:39:02.911]  So, we have caught them red-handed.
[00:39:04.852 --> 00:39:05.372]  Red-handed.
[00:39:07.302 --> 00:39:12.447]  And I said this on the 13th, the 14th, the 15th, the 16th, the 17th.
[00:39:13.788 --> 00:39:15.830]  I said, next they're going to say Iran's going to kill Trump.
[00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:22.577]  And then they're going to start a war with Iran, which you now see happening, and blow Trump up or something, or shoot his airplane down and say that it was the Iranians.
[00:39:22.597 --> 00:39:23.658]  And then they came out and said that.
[00:39:24.178 --> 00:39:25.159]  I mean, I'm inside their heads.
[00:39:28.582 --> 00:39:29.944]  But what else did I say over and over again?
[00:39:30.999 --> 00:39:38.321]  I said Trump has to come out and he can pat the local secret service, you know, try to protect him and say, okay, they're good.
[00:39:38.822 --> 00:39:39.282]  That's fine.
[00:39:40.082 --> 00:39:47.544]  But he's got to say Mayorkas and Roe and Garland are guilty of this.
[00:39:48.545 --> 00:39:50.125]  It's obvious the people know it.
[00:39:50.766 --> 00:39:52.766]  He doesn't just go back to Butler to draw attention to this.
[00:39:53.246 --> 00:39:54.707]  He needs to do it now.
[00:39:56.058 --> 00:39:59.041]  Not through his surrogates, not through Don Jr., not through J.D.
[00:39:59.081 --> 00:40:01.843]  Vance, not through Alex Jones, not through Tucker Carlson.
[00:40:02.343 --> 00:40:03.885]  He has to do it himself.
[00:40:03.945 --> 00:40:05.046]  This is a no-brainer.
[00:40:05.646 --> 00:40:06.827]  The people know it's true.
[00:40:08.188 --> 00:40:10.550]  And Trump has to say, I'm really concerned they're going to try to kill me again.
[00:40:10.831 --> 00:40:11.811]  They clearly stood down.
[00:40:11.831 --> 00:40:12.712]  He can go over the evidence.
[00:40:13.032 --> 00:40:15.695]  He can talk about it, and he needs to talk about it every day.
[00:40:18.837 --> 00:40:20.459]  Because they're going to try again.
[00:40:22.062 --> 00:40:31.105]  But if he lets them know that if I get killed, like the Godfather says, in that famous scene, guys, pull up Godfather Commission meeting.
[00:40:33.365 --> 00:40:34.746]  Godfather 1 Commission meeting.
[00:40:34.766 --> 00:40:48.090]  They're all around a big table, and one mob boss's son's been killed, and Don Corleone's son's been killed, and he says, I won't be the one to break the peace as long as I'm alive, but I'm a, you know,
[00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:56.471]  Person that loves my family, and I have selfish reasons, I don't want any of my other family killed, and so I will not break the peace if you don't, and so they make a deal.
[00:40:56.891 --> 00:40:57.971]  But he says, but let me say this.
[00:40:59.852 --> 00:41:09.833]  If my other son, Michael, who's now coming back to the United States, you know, killed the police captain, this is all based on true stories, I've changed the names.
[00:41:12.454 --> 00:41:18.195]  When he comes back, if he should be struck by a bolt of lightning, or if a police officer should shoot him in the head,
[00:41:20.031 --> 00:41:21.432]  Or he should fall down some stairs.
[00:41:21.732 --> 00:41:22.213]  I added that.
[00:41:23.474 --> 00:41:24.935]  I'm gonna blame everybody in this room.
[00:41:26.576 --> 00:41:28.578]  And Trump needs to explain that right now.
[00:41:30.159 --> 00:41:30.859]  Get out of the way.
[00:41:30.959 --> 00:41:31.980]  Let us save the country.
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.241]  You don't want a civil war.
[00:41:33.301 --> 00:41:34.262]  You're gonna lose this fight.
[00:41:36.043 --> 00:41:38.725]  But if you kill me, everybody needs to know you did it.
[00:41:39.906 --> 00:41:40.847]  That's the no-brainer.
[00:41:42.668 --> 00:41:43.449]  And he needs to do it.
[00:41:43.469 --> 00:41:46.992]  He needs to do it right now.
[00:41:48.153 --> 00:41:49.253]  But they gotta kill Trump.
[00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:49.754]  That's the key.
[00:41:52.512 --> 00:42:07.945]  And so, we should have discussions about what is the maximum pressure we put on the hijacked, crazy Fed leadership, whose giant child trafficking and every other, starting World War III, and they're just out of their minds.
[00:42:09.166 --> 00:42:11.227]  How do we get it through to them to stop it?
[00:42:13.789 --> 00:42:19.254]  But they're forcing everybody into just a position of really bad stuff.
[00:42:22.117 --> 00:42:24.981]  And I really don't want to go down this road.
[00:42:26.883 --> 00:42:27.745]  But they're taking us there.
[00:42:27.765 --> 00:42:29.186]  Alright, finish the clip.
[00:42:38.587 --> 00:42:40.949]  This has become muscle memory for the federal government, Jesse.
[00:42:41.169 --> 00:42:44.571]  This is a pattern that needs to end at some point in our history.
[00:42:44.992 --> 00:42:45.812]  Let now be it.
[00:42:46.273 --> 00:42:51.536]  The government has gotten so in the habit of lying to the American people, they don't trust the people with the truth.
[00:42:51.937 --> 00:42:54.899]  Their basic attitude is, whatever it is, we can't handle it.
[00:42:55.399 --> 00:43:01.846]  And you know what, this country was founded on the idea that, you know what, we the people, we can handle the truth, we require the truth.
[00:43:02.386 --> 00:43:10.115]  And at this moment, Jesse, on the eve of every one of the elections we've had for the last couple of cycles, you have government lies or government-related lies.
[00:43:10.575 --> 00:43:11.596]  Russia collusion hoax.
[00:43:11.936 --> 00:43:14.558]  Hunter Biden laptop with intelligence experts supporting it.
[00:43:14.938 --> 00:43:15.859]  Joe Biden's health.
[00:43:16.079 --> 00:43:19.321]  Now even something as grave as this assassination attempt.
[00:43:19.782 --> 00:43:21.663]  Whatever the truth is, just tell us the truth.
[00:43:21.983 --> 00:43:22.984]  The people can handle it.
[00:43:23.304 --> 00:43:25.225]  And that's how we're going to rebuild trust in this country.
[00:43:25.245 --> 00:43:34.612]  Because if you don't tell us the truth and keep lying and then keep getting caught lying and then lying about the lie you just told, it makes us think there's something else going on.
[00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:38.635]  If you just say we screwed up, we had a guy that fell asleep.
[00:43:39.335 --> 00:43:41.156]  We didn't show up to the briefing.
[00:43:41.176 --> 00:43:43.077]  We turned it down because we didn't have enough money.
[00:43:43.777 --> 00:43:50.319]  Okay, we can say you're an idiot and you should be fired, but if you don't say anything and just lie, then it makes us think something else is happening.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:51.700]  Don't they see that?
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.060]  That's exactly right.
[00:43:53.741 --> 00:43:54.741]  That's exactly right, Jesse.
[00:43:54.781 --> 00:43:56.902]  This erodes public trust and it's consistent.
[00:43:57.482 --> 00:43:58.302]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[00:43:58.923 --> 00:44:00.703]  Yeah, so just go ahead and say it.
[00:44:00.803 --> 00:44:02.304]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:44:02.604 --> 00:44:03.324]  They stood down.
[00:44:03.364 --> 00:44:04.164]  It's an inside job.
[00:44:04.184 --> 00:44:05.345]  They're going to try to kill him again.
[00:44:05.825 --> 00:44:08.446]  So let's stop eating around the edges here and just cut to the chase.
[00:44:09.106 --> 00:44:11.787]  That's why they want me off the air before they did this, because they knew I'll just call it.
[00:44:12.067 --> 00:44:14.427]  I'm not going to sit here and eat around the edges.
[00:44:14.468 --> 00:44:16.708]  And I'm not trying to say, oh, I'm the biggest, baddest, aren't I?
[00:44:16.748 --> 00:44:16.968]  Great.
[00:44:17.288 --> 00:44:18.869]  I want to beat these people, folks.
[00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.990]  They did it!
[00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:25.131]  They're gonna try it again!
[00:44:25.151 --> 00:44:27.292]  We're just gonna sit here and take it?
[00:44:29.773 --> 00:44:33.235]  They're covering up, they're not doing any interviews, they're not creating any record of what they did.
[00:44:33.435 --> 00:44:35.416]  There was no press conferences, no discussion.
[00:44:36.677 --> 00:44:37.558]  Because they did it!
[00:44:38.178 --> 00:44:51.185]  And that means in those interviews, and in what happened, and tracking back what went on, you're going to find out this was an FBI, Deep State, CIA operation, just like 63, and just like 81, to kill the President.
[00:44:53.088 --> 00:44:59.054]  If you don't say anything and just lie, then it makes us think something else is happening.
[00:44:59.534 --> 00:45:00.435]  Don't they see that?
[00:45:00.996 --> 00:45:01.797]  That's exactly right.
[00:45:02.477 --> 00:45:03.478]  That's exactly right, Jesse.
[00:45:03.498 --> 00:45:05.660]  This erodes public trust and it's consistent.
[00:45:06.001 --> 00:45:12.427]  However bad they're worried the public will see them as being, it's gonna be far worse in terms of what the public actually expects.
[00:45:12.907 --> 00:45:17.708]  The public is now sick and tired of government leaders and a media industrial complex that covers up for it.
[00:45:18.129 --> 00:45:19.269]  Just tell us the truth.
[00:45:19.329 --> 00:45:22.490]  It's like the equivalent of what was a Colonel Jessup in A Few Good Men.
[00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:24.010]  He said, you can't handle the truth.
[00:45:24.411 --> 00:45:27.051]  That's effectively the way the government looks at its people today.
[00:45:27.571 --> 00:45:29.012]  And I think our last best chance
[00:45:29.372 --> 00:45:37.779]  I'm biased on this, but last best chance of a president who actually is going to tell us that truth is going to be Donald Trump, an outsider who isn't afraid to tell it like it is.
[00:45:38.279 --> 00:45:45.344]  And if Donald Trump wins decisively this November, as I hope and still expect will be the case, it will be because he's a truth teller.
[00:45:45.645 --> 00:45:49.828]  Not because it always lands well on your ears, but that's what somebody who tells the truth tells you.
[00:45:49.848 --> 00:45:50.208]  You know what?
[00:45:50.608 --> 00:45:54.371]  Sometimes if you care about, the truth is if you care about yourself, you tell someone what they want to hear.
[00:45:54.812 --> 00:45:56.273]  If you care about the people, you tell them the
[00:45:57.602 --> 00:46:09.315]  And what's incredible about the footage of Crooks while Trump's speaking, crawling around on his hands and knees on the roof, minutes before he fires shots at him, is if you don't think about a camera, I mean, that's how close he is.
[00:46:09.335 --> 00:46:12.358]  He looks small in the lens, but that's really close, folks.
[00:46:13.479 --> 00:46:14.840]  I mean, that is spitting distance.
[00:46:16.742 --> 00:46:19.465]  And everybody sees him!
[00:46:20.336 --> 00:46:23.457]  You know, the main crowd's looking at Trump, but everybody else is like, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[00:46:23.477 --> 00:46:28.698]  And they sit there because there was no secret service team that directs what people are supposed to do.
[00:46:28.979 --> 00:46:33.380]  So the snipers start calling, as I said the first day I saw the video, can we get an authorization to shoot?
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:34.160]  And they weren't given it.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.721]  So they waited until he shot to then kill him.
[00:46:39.722 --> 00:46:42.283]  Because they've got things so compartmentalized, so controlled.
[00:46:42.583 --> 00:46:45.263]  I'm gonna go over the documents, show you some of the articles here in a moment.
[00:46:45.303 --> 00:46:47.044]  But here's that clip from the Godfather.
[00:46:50.316 --> 00:46:53.018]  But I must have strict assurance from Corleone.
[00:46:54.119 --> 00:46:59.584]  As time goes by and his position becomes stronger, will he attempt any individual vendetta?
[00:46:59.884 --> 00:47:01.626]  Look, we are all reasonable men here.
[00:47:02.046 --> 00:47:04.348]  We don't have to give assurances as if we were lawyers.
[00:47:05.569 --> 00:47:06.730]  You talk about vengeance.
[00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:10.494]  Is vengeance gonna bring your son back to you?
[00:47:11.695 --> 00:47:12.676]  Or my boy to me?
[00:47:14.417 --> 00:47:16.079]  I forgot the vengeance of my son.
[00:47:19.952 --> 00:47:21.393]  But I have selfish reasons.
[00:47:24.475 --> 00:47:27.917]  My youngest son is supposed to leave this country.
[00:47:30.019 --> 00:47:31.500]  Because of this so-and-so business.
[00:47:33.021 --> 00:47:33.401]  All right.
[00:47:34.582 --> 00:47:37.404]  I have to make arrangements to bring him back here safely.
[00:47:38.004 --> 00:47:39.785]  Clear of all these false charges.
[00:47:42.147 --> 00:47:43.708]  But I'm a superstitious man.
[00:47:45.373 --> 00:48:02.421]  And if some unlucky accident should befall him, if he should get shot in the head by a police officer, or if he should hang himself in his jail cell, or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning, then I'm going to blame some of the people in this room.
[00:48:05.143 --> 00:48:06.363]  And that I do not forgive.
[00:48:09.925 --> 00:48:11.506]  But, that aside,
[00:48:15.416 --> 00:48:25.551]  Let me say that I swear, on the souls of my grandchildren, that I will not be the one to break the peace we've made here today.
[00:48:34.545 --> 00:48:39.769]  All right, Rob Dew quickly got it together because I got here this morning to think to get this, but they found the clubs.
[00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:45.914]  This is Director Ronald McDonald Rowe, the Democrat Party operative.
[00:48:45.934 --> 00:48:46.355]  Look him up.
[00:48:46.895 --> 00:48:47.476]  Piece of filth.
[00:48:49.366 --> 00:48:54.368]  With the Senators, Howley and Cruz, saying, who pulled the protection?
[00:48:54.749 --> 00:48:56.549]  Well, we don't even know protection was pulled.
[00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:57.950]  Boom, felony number one.
[00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:59.931]  And I don't know.
[00:48:59.951 --> 00:49:00.892]  I don't know.
[00:49:00.912 --> 00:49:01.872]  I don't know.
[00:49:02.692 --> 00:49:08.955]  And now it's come out, he directed it all in sworn testimony, closed session, as witnesses.
[00:49:09.596 --> 00:49:11.457]  It's not just one Secret Service, it's a bunch of them.
[00:49:11.677 --> 00:49:14.258]  And then they blamed the local cops and said, oh, they didn't respond.
[00:49:14.498 --> 00:49:18.320]  The local cops are, we weren't even given anybody to talk to, because the command team
[00:49:19.372 --> 00:49:24.957]  The command and controls, the Secret Service, Overwatch, was not there.
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.802]  They opened the door for the whole thing to happen.
[00:49:30.222 --> 00:49:31.624]  My God, this is so obvious.
[00:49:32.925 --> 00:49:33.766]  Here's the compilation.
[00:49:34.126 --> 00:49:34.827]  Well, you know what?
[00:49:36.448 --> 00:49:39.471]  We're going to break in two and a half minutes, three minutes, so this is a four and a half minute clip.
[00:49:39.511 --> 00:49:40.112]  I'm going to come back.
[00:49:40.612 --> 00:49:41.093]  I'll play it.
[00:49:42.113 --> 00:49:45.456]  Some stations don't carry this, but it'll all be archived in the next five minutes.
[00:49:45.896 --> 00:49:50.140]  It'll be archived at Bandai Mediago and Rel Alex Jones today, and we'll put this out, I'll introduce it.
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.401]  We'll put this whole piece out.
[00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:54.223]  This is... This is really important.
[00:49:56.857 --> 00:50:02.779]  So I might just wait till the 6th after and play it then, even though we got a bunch of economy news in the stock market and what's happening and all the rest of it.
[00:50:02.799 --> 00:50:06.820]  Been the biggest moves in a while, so we're going to be talking about that and much other news.
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:10.041]  Speaking of the economy, I know we're in a deep recession.
[00:50:10.121 --> 00:50:11.261]  I know the economy's fried.
[00:50:11.702 --> 00:50:14.442]  Our audience is as big as it ever was, back to numbers in 2016, 30, 40 million a day.
[00:50:16.423 --> 00:50:17.243]  Barely could pay the bills.
[00:50:17.303 --> 00:50:17.863]  I'm not bitching.
[00:50:18.224 --> 00:50:19.724]  I'm just saying, aren't we important?
[00:50:19.764 --> 00:50:21.805]  You know, I know you got to make your choices where you're going to spend money.

[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:37.260]  Highest quality.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:41.263]  PQQ, CoQ10 for your telomeres, your body, your immune system, your longevity.
[00:51:42.063 --> 00:51:43.985]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:51:45.325 --> 00:51:46.046]  Nitric Boost.
[00:51:46.426 --> 00:51:48.908]  Bickovitz, the scientist, she's not even part of that.
[00:51:48.928 --> 00:51:49.969]  We don't pay her to say it.
[00:51:50.229 --> 00:51:51.210]  She's like, I've looked at your formula.
[00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:52.050]  It's the best out there.
[00:51:53.031 --> 00:51:55.934]  And again, we don't sell it for the Viagra effect, folks.
[00:51:56.454 --> 00:51:58.215]  But that's what it does to your blood vessels and bodies.
[00:51:58.636 --> 00:52:02.359]  Wait till you take Nitric Boost and see what it does.
[00:52:03.849 --> 00:52:06.931]  Infowarsstore.com, drjonesandadgles.com.
[00:52:07.431 --> 00:52:08.572]  Write down the URL.
[00:52:08.652 --> 00:52:09.973]  Go there and support us, please.
[00:52:10.313 --> 00:52:11.714]  I humbly ask for your support.
[00:52:11.774 --> 00:52:12.934]  I'm firing the bat signal.
[00:52:13.355 --> 00:52:14.035]  I am in your hands.
[00:52:14.055 --> 00:52:14.776]  You are in my hands.
[00:52:14.796 --> 00:52:16.557]  We need the support, plus the great products.
[00:52:16.597 --> 00:52:17.317]  Take action now.
[00:52:17.397 --> 00:52:22.260]  drjonesandadgles.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.461]  We'll be right back.
[00:52:23.481 --> 00:52:23.861]  Stay with us.
[00:52:25.422 --> 00:52:30.565]  This is a make it or break it moment, so I need people to connect those synapses in their brain for you to make a decision.
[00:52:31.753 --> 00:52:34.855]  If you don't support InfoWars, we will be shut down.
[00:52:34.875 --> 00:52:37.697]  And people say, well, they're constantly trying to shut you down.
[00:52:37.737 --> 00:52:38.477]  How are you still in the air?
[00:52:38.618 --> 00:52:38.918]  God.
[00:52:39.938 --> 00:52:41.019]  But God works through people.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:47.844]  So, we're in a paradox here where the judge says we're open for three more months.
[00:52:49.545 --> 00:52:54.008]  If we're able to get a buyer under the law, they won't be able to shut us down.
[00:52:54.048 --> 00:52:54.948]  I'll just work with somebody else.
[00:52:55.849 --> 00:52:56.369]  And that's coming.
[00:52:56.389 --> 00:52:57.089]  That's got to be set up.
[00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:59.111]  But in the meantime,
[00:53:00.313 --> 00:53:07.435]  If people believe the news that we're being shut down everywhere, which they tried to do and failed, by that foregone conclusion, we're shut down.
[00:53:07.555 --> 00:53:17.377]  And under the last federal bankruptcy manager who would not reorder product and killed all our advertising, he was positioning us to be shut down and tried to shut us down.
[00:53:18.437 --> 00:53:18.897]  We caught him.
[00:53:19.137 --> 00:53:20.177]  The judge caught him and fired him.
[00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:23.138]  We're almost sold out of all the products.
[00:53:23.991 --> 00:53:24.231]  All right?
[00:53:25.031 --> 00:53:27.772]  But we have a lot of great products that are still in stock.
[00:53:28.252 --> 00:53:28.992]  Limited supplies.
[00:53:29.052 --> 00:53:32.313]  So I need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:53:32.533 --> 00:53:33.593]  And we just had a donation button.
[00:53:33.613 --> 00:53:34.374]  Maybe we should just do that.
[00:53:35.114 --> 00:53:37.875]  You're fighting for freedom in a key election, battling the globalists.
[00:53:37.895 --> 00:53:38.535]  We need support.
[00:53:39.275 --> 00:53:40.855]  But we want a long-term relationship with you.
[00:53:40.875 --> 00:53:42.816]  We want you to be symbiotic.
[00:53:42.836 --> 00:53:50.338]  We want you to get great products you like and deliver to you quickly and enjoy them and have them empower you and make your life better so you love them and you keep getting them.
[00:53:50.358 --> 00:53:51.298]  We want a relationship.
[00:53:52.245 --> 00:53:58.008]  So, there's the InfoWars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:53:58.748 --> 00:54:05.992]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's saw palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[00:54:06.012 --> 00:54:10.454]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[00:54:10.514 --> 00:54:11.775]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[00:54:12.495 --> 00:54:23.163]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWars MD.
[00:54:23.543 --> 00:54:25.104]  We've got Ashwagandha Gummi.
[00:54:25.685 --> 00:54:29.007]  Relaxes you, makes you feel really relaxed with no downer feeling.
[00:54:29.868 --> 00:54:30.268]  Amazing.
[00:54:31.089 --> 00:54:31.929]  An incredible product.
[00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.871]  Goodnight Sleep.
[00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:35.372]  We have a lot of great sleep aids.
[00:54:35.392 --> 00:54:36.073]  This one's excellent.
[00:54:36.093 --> 00:54:37.233]  They're all different formulas.
[00:54:37.454 --> 00:54:37.974]  People love it.
[00:54:38.134 --> 00:54:38.915]  Goodnight Sleep.
[00:54:39.595 --> 00:54:40.316]  InfoWars MD.
[00:54:42.501 --> 00:54:47.305]  Ashwagandha with black pepper, which relaxes you and makes you lose weight.
[00:54:48.066 --> 00:54:49.027]  These are all concentrates.
[00:54:49.427 --> 00:54:50.348]  Joint Relief Max.
[00:54:50.528 --> 00:54:51.349]  Works really well.
[00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:52.690]  Great pain relief.
[00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:53.711]  Huge bottle of it.
[00:54:53.811 --> 00:54:54.652]  You know, jam-packed.
[00:54:55.112 --> 00:54:55.653]  It's there.
[00:54:56.173 --> 00:54:57.114]  Joint Relief Max.
[00:54:57.535 --> 00:54:58.575]  Infowars MD.
[00:54:58.916 --> 00:54:59.717]  Prostate support.
[00:54:59.777 --> 00:55:00.437]  Already mentioned that.
[00:55:01.078 --> 00:55:02.359]  This is just the top formula.
[00:55:02.379 --> 00:55:03.180]  Super high quality.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:03.960]  Organic.
[00:55:04.561 --> 00:55:05.422]  Nerve Renew.
[00:55:06.082 --> 00:55:06.522]  Amazing.
[00:55:06.802 --> 00:55:09.303]  To get your nerves, not to kill pain, but to get your nerves healthy.
[00:55:09.483 --> 00:55:10.183]  Nitric Boost.
[00:55:10.383 --> 00:55:11.783]  Vitamin Refusion about to sell out.
[00:55:11.983 --> 00:55:12.623]  About to sell out.
[00:55:12.683 --> 00:55:13.544]  Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:55:13.744 --> 00:55:17.264]  And something I never talk about, and should talk about more, Probiotic Fiber.
[00:55:17.404 --> 00:55:21.385]  A super high-end product at a low price at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:55:21.425 --> 00:55:22.445]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:55:24.266 --> 00:55:25.766]  All right, here is a compilation.
[00:55:26.026 --> 00:55:26.766]  We're live right now.
[00:55:26.786 --> 00:55:35.388]  We're going to post this to X of the acting Secret Service Director, Ronald the Tyrant Traitor, Benedict Arnold Rowe.
[00:55:36.638 --> 00:55:47.721]  Saying he doesn't know stuff was pulled and he doesn't know who gave the order to pull security and now we know he ordered the pulling of the key secret service group that coordinates the response to a shooter on a roof.
[00:55:48.141 --> 00:55:49.181]  The key coordination group.
[00:55:49.221 --> 00:55:50.042]  This is treason.
[00:55:50.062 --> 00:55:52.322]  This is a stand down, cut and dry.
[00:55:52.742 --> 00:55:54.203]  This man needs to be arrested now.
[00:55:54.243 --> 00:55:54.563]  Here it is.
[00:55:55.339 --> 00:56:13.412]  RealClearPolitics reports this morning that you were directly involved in denying additional security resources and personnel, including counter-snipers, not just to this event, but over the last two years, that President Trump's team repeatedly asked for these additional resources, and you personally were involved in denying them.
[00:56:13.452 --> 00:56:13.892]  Is that true?
[00:56:14.233 --> 00:56:16.194]  Senator, as I stated earlier, that is not true.
[00:56:16.214 --> 00:56:18.836]  So you never denied any resources to former President Trump's team?
[00:56:20.037 --> 00:56:20.697]  No, not me.
[00:56:20.917 --> 00:56:21.858]  No, sir.
[00:56:21.898 --> 00:56:22.659]  And you weren't involved?
[00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:23.159]  Stop there!
[00:56:23.179 --> 00:56:23.940]  Oh my God!
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:27.682]  They don't have high-level whistleblowers with the documents.
[00:56:28.122 --> 00:56:28.622]  They've got it.
[00:56:28.682 --> 00:56:29.222]  It's all here.
[00:56:29.903 --> 00:56:33.505]  This was four days ago when it was just in the news and the Secret Service agents had sent it out.
[00:56:33.985 --> 00:56:36.766]  Now, he just committed massive perjury right there.
[00:56:38.547 --> 00:56:38.967]  Continue.
[00:56:40.208 --> 00:56:40.908]  No, not me.
[00:56:41.088 --> 00:56:41.489]  No, sir.
[00:56:41.569 --> 00:56:43.510]  And you weren't involved in any of it.
[00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:45.631]  You were never involved in the decision-making.
[00:56:46.971 --> 00:56:47.732]  No, sir, I was not.
[00:56:48.332 --> 00:56:50.013]  Multiple requests were made.
[00:56:51.616 --> 00:56:56.721]  By Trump's protective detail and by Trump's campaign team to the Secret Service for additional resources.
[00:56:56.741 --> 00:56:58.963]  I'm told that those were denied.
[00:57:00.023 --> 00:57:07.570]  And as I recall, the Secret Service spokesperson initially denied that such requests were made and denied.
[00:57:08.331 --> 00:57:09.772]  Why not tell the truth from the outset?
[00:57:09.852 --> 00:57:11.554]  What were they trying to do there?
[00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:16.283]  So, Senator, I don't think there was any intention to mislead.
[00:57:16.923 --> 00:57:18.564]  Seems like a pretty material fact, doesn't it?
[00:57:19.644 --> 00:57:20.745]  We saw that report.
[00:57:20.865 --> 00:57:21.505]  Go ahead, Senator.
[00:57:21.625 --> 00:57:29.587]  Will you commit to me that you will submit to us in writing what requests were made, by whom, and to whom, and when they were denied?
[00:57:30.128 --> 00:57:30.508]  I will, sir.
[00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:42.279]  Secret Service put out an official statement from your spokesperson that says there's an untrue assertion that a member of the former president's team requested additional security resources, that those were rebuffed.
[00:57:42.499 --> 00:57:43.800]  This is absolutely false.
[00:57:44.361 --> 00:57:50.106]  In fact, we added protective resources and technology and capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo.
[00:57:50.907 --> 00:57:51.848]  Was this tweet accurate?
[00:57:53.669 --> 00:57:56.312]  With respect to Butler, Pennsylvania, it is accurate, sir.
[00:57:56.932 --> 00:58:00.914]  So I'm reading from the Washington Post, July 20th, 2024.
[00:58:01.034 --> 00:58:04.316]  Secret Service said to have denied requests for more security at Trump events.
[00:58:04.356 --> 00:58:05.416]  The opening paragraph.
[00:58:05.456 --> 00:58:06.437]  Top officials of the U.S.
[00:58:06.477 --> 00:58:18.743]  Secret Service repeatedly denied requests for additional resources and personnel sought by Donald Trump's security detail in the two years leading up to his attempted assassination, according to four people familiar with the requests.
[00:58:19.203 --> 00:58:19.823]  Is that right?
[00:58:19.923 --> 00:58:20.784]  That repeatedly?
[00:58:21.444 --> 00:58:26.425]  The Trump detail asked for more resources and repeatedly Secret Service leadership turned that down?
[00:58:27.045 --> 00:58:28.545]  That is not accurate, Senator.
[00:58:29.426 --> 00:58:30.586]  Assets are requested.
[00:58:30.666 --> 00:58:32.366]  There's a process that is made.
[00:58:33.726 --> 00:58:37.287]  How many requests did the Trump team or the Trump detail ask for?
[00:58:38.127 --> 00:58:40.208]  I can get you that number in a queue.
[00:58:40.488 --> 00:58:41.208]  You don't know now?
[00:58:41.308 --> 00:58:45.429]  I can speak to the ones that were reported in the Washington Post and we can go through them if you like.
[00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:47.809]  But you don't know how many requests there were?
[00:58:50.262 --> 00:58:55.023]  In general, how many requests since 2021 that the former Trump detail has made a request for answer?
[00:58:55.043 --> 00:58:55.884]  You've had two weeks.
[00:58:55.924 --> 00:58:59.105]  You had a spokesperson put something else right there on it.
[00:58:59.325 --> 00:59:01.625]  We're live right now, but I'm going to take some of my comments earlier.
[00:59:01.945 --> 00:59:03.786]  This full clip we're put on X right now.
[00:59:04.726 --> 00:59:07.467]  Acting bombshell video, bombshell proof.
[00:59:09.328 --> 00:59:13.829]  Acting Secret Service director caught in massive perjury.
[00:59:14.889 --> 00:59:16.870]  Acting Secret Service director who ordered
[00:59:19.721 --> 00:59:21.202]  July 13th, stand down.
[00:59:22.783 --> 00:59:24.003]  Caught in massive perjury.
[00:59:24.203 --> 00:59:31.887]  I mean, you heard him say, I was not involved, and I don't know who ordered the resources off.
[00:59:32.307 --> 00:59:36.449]  And now it's confirmed that he was in charge and he ordered all of that.
[00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:40.672]  And they've already interviewed, I'm told, dozens of Secret Service senior people.
[00:59:40.952 --> 00:59:43.133]  And they've got over 100 people they're interviewing right now.
[00:59:44.465 --> 00:59:48.167]  Again, this broke earlier in the week that they sent their letters out and were going public.
[00:59:48.487 --> 00:59:50.208]  Now they've gone to Congress.
[00:59:51.068 --> 00:59:52.229]  Now they've talked to the Senators.
[00:59:52.269 --> 00:59:53.350]  Now they're giving the receipts.
[00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:54.510]  They're giving the documents.
[00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:56.011]  They're giving the emails, the text messages.
[00:59:58.532 --> 00:59:59.573]  They're going to try on Trump again.
[01:00:00.513 --> 01:00:01.694]  This is total desperateness.
[01:00:03.855 --> 01:00:06.396]  He just got up there in front of you and the whole world and lied.
[01:00:08.257 --> 01:00:10.859]  I believe the evidence all points towards him and Mayorkas.
[01:00:11.199 --> 01:00:12.179]  I believe he was in the room.
[01:00:12.659 --> 01:00:13.120]  I believe
[01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:19.886]  That Mr. Rowe was the coordinator of the assassination.
[01:00:20.507 --> 01:00:30.671]  All right, as soon as I saw the giant economic developments yesterday afternoon, I called Dr. Kirk Elliott, an amazing, accomplished economist, also degreed theologian.
[01:00:30.771 --> 01:00:37.374]  I wanted to get him on about the stock market and about the jobs numbers and about interest rate cuts.
[01:00:37.594 --> 01:00:40.055]  England, their central bank already did it.
[01:00:41.175 --> 01:00:43.356]  And now Chevron's leaving California to move to Texas.
[01:00:43.376 --> 01:00:44.736]  That is huge.
[01:00:45.497 --> 01:00:51.239]  We've got all of this news, and I want to get Kirk Elliott, who's a really smart guy's take on all of that.
[01:00:51.759 --> 01:00:56.501]  Markets sink on weaker-than-expected job report as fears rise of slowing economy.
[01:00:56.841 --> 01:00:57.981]  Yeah, in the real world, it's bad.
[01:00:58.462 --> 01:01:03.183]  Stock market sell-off and disappointing economic data raises prospects of pre-election recession.
[01:01:04.584 --> 01:01:06.745]  Bidenomics, which is really Obama-nomics,
[01:01:07.526 --> 01:01:10.029]  Historic surge in corporate bankruptcies across U.S.
[01:01:10.129 --> 01:01:11.731]  highest levels since COVID pandemic.
[01:01:12.833 --> 01:01:14.795]  Chevron taking headquarters to Texas.
[01:01:15.496 --> 01:01:16.697]  Thank Gavin Newsom for that.
[01:01:17.478 --> 01:01:26.910]  But before we hit that, just as a patriot, a father, and as an American, Dr. Kirk Elliott, here we are 20 days after the attempted assassination of Trump.
[01:01:27.859 --> 01:01:34.124]  The Acting Secret Service Director, we learned, was in charge of the whole thing with the stand down, with the whistleblowers, all confirming.
[01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:35.865]  No coordination team.
[01:01:35.885 --> 01:01:37.486]  That's the main team you've got to have.
[01:01:38.066 --> 01:01:39.267]  So there was no communications.
[01:01:39.307 --> 01:01:40.428]  Communications are cut off.
[01:01:40.908 --> 01:01:45.351]  So he could crawl around the roof for 26 minutes, run around with rangefinders for 90 minutes.
[01:01:46.152 --> 01:01:50.475]  The video of him crawling on the roof, everybody pointing, and then nobody gets Trump off the stage.
[01:01:50.955 --> 01:01:51.496]  I mean, this...
[01:01:52.276 --> 01:02:11.845]  This is insane, and this is cut and dry, and now this has all come out that the acting director, Ronald Rowe, has done this, but they control the Homeland Security system through Mayorkas, they control the Justice Department, and so the foxes are watching the hen house.
[01:02:11.925 --> 01:02:13.045]  What do we do about this?
[01:02:13.365 --> 01:02:15.266]  What is your take on this historic moment?
[01:02:15.286 --> 01:02:18.428]  Because the obvious trajectory, as I've been saying, they're going to try to kill Trump.
[01:02:18.488 --> 01:02:18.928]  It happened.
[01:02:19.708 --> 01:02:21.969]  I said they'll make Biden step down probably the 20th, 21st.
[01:02:21.989 --> 01:02:22.769]  Happened as I said.
[01:02:23.229 --> 01:02:24.190]  This is not hard.
[01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:25.010]  It's like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[01:02:27.311 --> 01:02:28.091]  Next number is 11, 12.
[01:02:28.991 --> 01:02:29.892]  Consider 12, 13.
[01:02:29.992 --> 01:02:31.112]  Consider 13, 14.
[01:02:31.552 --> 01:02:33.413]  It's a trajectory.
[01:02:33.893 --> 01:02:35.094]  People say, oh, how do you know all this?
[01:02:35.154 --> 01:02:37.895]  My God, it's butt naked in front of us here.
[01:02:38.735 --> 01:02:47.058]  So how would you quantify this moment as an economist, as a theologian, as a father about where we are and what do you think we should do about this?
[01:02:48.729 --> 01:02:57.196]  Well, boy, when you look at it, Alex, from a theological standpoint, right, you can read through the scriptures, and what does it say?
[01:02:57.256 --> 01:03:06.945]  It talks about in the last days, you know, there's going to be wars and rumors of wars, and be careful about who you listen to, test the prophets, all these things, right?
[01:03:06.965 --> 01:03:07.606]  So you're going to have
[01:03:08.226 --> 01:03:08.386]  Well,
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:25.881]  That's right.
[01:03:45.134 --> 01:03:49.002]  Which tells me somebody is orchestrating something, right?
[01:03:49.042 --> 01:03:55.415]  These are all physical manifestations of a spiritual battle that's being waged because when all of the same
[01:03:56.767 --> 01:04:00.689]  Same result, which is decline, decadence, moral decay.
[01:04:02.129 --> 01:04:06.191]  What's considered good is evil, and what's considered evil is good, right?
[01:04:06.231 --> 01:04:08.892]  It's like everything is backwards in this world.
[01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:14.835]  And, you know, even looking at the distractions that we have right now to keep our
[01:04:15.695 --> 01:04:18.497]  Eyes off of, focused on what's important.
[01:04:18.537 --> 01:04:21.560]  Like, okay, you've got the Olympics going on right now, right?
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:34.950]  And everybody's watching that, and there's, while Hezbollah is attacking Israel, and now there's this war against Hamas, and the Houthis, and the hostages, and everything that we're seeing is, like, evil.
[01:04:35.691 --> 01:04:36.271]  It's evil.
[01:04:36.632 --> 01:04:40.374]  The assassination attempt on the President, that's, the people that
[01:04:41.158 --> 01:04:49.289]  That President Trump should trust the most Secret Service is allowing these things to happen.
[01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:55.617]  It's like when trust is eroded in society, what else do you have left?
[01:04:56.465 --> 01:04:57.746]  You don't have anything.
[01:04:57.786 --> 01:05:04.393]  And this is where you look at like the community organizer role that Obama played, right?
[01:05:04.453 --> 01:05:09.979]  It's like, how do you get people to fall in line with what you want?
[01:05:10.259 --> 01:05:11.621]  You create questions.
[01:05:11.681 --> 01:05:16.085]  When people start to question their leaders, then you've won the game.
[01:05:16.886 --> 01:05:17.046]  Right?
[01:05:17.086 --> 01:05:24.996]  Because it doesn't take too much to get them to shift, to change positions, to even change internal biases that they may have had their whole life, Alex.
[01:05:25.016 --> 01:05:31.484]  And this is where we're seeing everything start to happen at the same time.
[01:05:32.225 --> 01:05:34.668]  And this is, all of this is creating fear.
[01:05:35.609 --> 01:05:39.891]  Fear in the hearts and minds of people, and God tells us what to do with fear.
[01:05:39.911 --> 01:05:42.392]  It's like, throw it back to the pit where it belongs.
[01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:44.593]  Fear is the opposite of love.
[01:05:44.673 --> 01:05:46.494]  Fear is the opposite of faith, right?
[01:05:46.594 --> 01:05:52.116]  So if we operate in the opposite spirit of fear, which is love, love your neighbor, right?
[01:05:52.916 --> 01:05:55.097]  Have no other God before you, love your neighbor.
[01:05:55.458 --> 01:05:59.539]  If people actually loved their neighbor, we wouldn't have this world that we're living in, right?
[01:05:59.599 --> 01:06:03.241]  And that's the secret, is if you love your neighbor, they're doing well, you're gonna do well.
[01:06:03.881 --> 01:06:10.627]  It doesn't mean you give them your wife and bend over and do whatever they want, but you still think about, you live in a community that affects everything, it's going to affect you.
[01:06:12.998 --> 01:06:14.079]  Yeah, 100%.
[01:06:14.699 --> 01:06:15.960]  I mean, I'm seeing videos.
[01:06:16.481 --> 01:06:17.682]  It made me cry, right?
[01:06:17.722 --> 01:06:26.208]  When the hostages, those hostages that were found, it's like they cut their ankles so they couldn't escape.
[01:06:26.248 --> 01:06:34.595]  Who knows what other kind of horrors they had unleashed upon them over the last 298 days, right, since October of last year.
[01:06:34.935 --> 01:06:35.795]  This is evil.
[01:06:36.636 --> 01:06:36.816]  Right?
[01:06:36.917 --> 01:06:40.781]  And we're not protecting the innocent.
[01:06:40.902 --> 01:06:43.605]  It's like, I don't get it, Alex.
[01:06:43.645 --> 01:06:47.670]  I mean, but to me, this is obviously a spiritual battle, right?
[01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:51.996]  And so, to me, all of these things are connected.
[01:06:52.176 --> 01:06:59.342]  Because if everything is moving downward at the same time, it's not just one element.
[01:06:59.402 --> 01:07:00.623]  It's not just the economy.
[01:07:01.063 --> 01:07:02.684]  It's not just politics.
[01:07:02.765 --> 01:07:04.266]  It's not just social decay.
[01:07:04.746 --> 01:07:14.274]  It's everything, which tells me that something is orchestrated from higher above to get all of these things to fall apart at the same time.
[01:07:15.811 --> 01:07:16.471]  Absolutely.
[01:07:16.872 --> 01:07:18.332]  What do you think Trump should do?
[01:07:18.352 --> 01:07:20.913]  I think he should come right out and say, clearly a stand down.
[01:07:22.014 --> 01:07:23.214]  Ronald Roe lied.
[01:07:23.255 --> 01:07:24.135]  He ran the whole thing.
[01:07:24.175 --> 01:07:25.055]  He lied to Congress.
[01:07:25.796 --> 01:07:26.416]  It's overwhelming.
[01:07:26.436 --> 01:07:29.497]  They bare minimum opened the door with criminal negligence on purpose to get him killed.
[01:07:29.517 --> 01:07:34.500]  They stood down, probably coordinated and wound up the guy, the young punk to do it.
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.941]  I mean, I think Trump needs to come out with all this right now.
[01:07:38.416 --> 01:07:42.360]  Oh, I think he has to, too, because if he doesn't, Alex, then what?
[01:07:43.041 --> 01:07:51.410]  If you don't cut off the head of the snake, how can he feel safe going anywhere moving forward if Secret Service can't even protect him?
[01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:53.032]  Well, yeah, but it's beyond even making him feel safe.
[01:07:53.072 --> 01:07:53.593]  That's a good point.
[01:07:54.453 --> 01:07:59.075]  But centrally, that gets the globalists off balance if he calls them out.
[01:07:59.115 --> 01:08:04.816]  Like, oh, they go, oh, Trump needs to stop saying Kamala has said she's an Indian her whole life and that she's not black.
[01:08:04.856 --> 01:08:07.857]  Well, she always identified as an Indian, never said she was black until now.
[01:08:08.257 --> 01:08:12.359]  They don't want him to say that because it's true and it hurts her because they're using identity politics.
[01:08:12.699 --> 01:08:14.820]  Whatever they don't want Trump to do, he should do.
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:17.540]  Who they don't want Trump to work with, he should support.
[01:08:17.881 --> 01:08:22.202]  So they're really scared of him coming out and saying this is an assassination attempt by the deep state.
[01:08:22.702 --> 01:08:24.510]  Because they're scared of that because it's the truth.
[01:08:24.570 --> 01:08:26.499]  He needs to do the opposite of what they want.
[01:08:28.049 --> 01:08:29.569]  Well, truth exposes lies.
[01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:31.230]  Light casts out darkness, right?
[01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:32.791]  They can't coexist together.
[01:08:33.411 --> 01:08:37.992]  So of course they want that because now they're being found out, right?
[01:08:38.032 --> 01:08:52.597]  And it's like, if you, if they keep stopping the truth with lie after lie after lie after lie, and having people think that they're the ones telling the truth, soon enough, truth will always cast out the darkness, right?
[01:08:52.637 --> 01:08:55.218]  And that's, that's the hope that we have.
[01:08:55.418 --> 01:08:56.058]  I mean, that's just,
[01:08:56.718 --> 01:08:59.119]  It's not just biblical, it's science, right?
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.042]  All it takes is a small little candle and you can light up an entirely dark room, right?
[01:09:04.082 --> 01:09:07.344]  It doesn't take too much light to cast out the darkness.
[01:09:08.328 --> 01:09:09.728]  All right, shifting gears in the economy.
[01:09:09.868 --> 01:09:11.689]  Big stock market down yesterday.
[01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:14.850]  We'll pull up the Nasdaq and the Dow right now.
[01:09:15.970 --> 01:09:17.871]  You've got really bad job numbers.
[01:09:17.891 --> 01:09:19.691]  You've got England cutting interest rates.
[01:09:19.731 --> 01:09:21.072]  You've got what's happening here.
[01:09:21.652 --> 01:09:26.093]  Markets sink on weaker-than-expected job reports as fears rise of slowing economy.
[01:09:26.133 --> 01:09:26.893]  That's CNN.
[01:09:27.314 --> 01:09:28.374]  Stock markets sell off.
[01:09:28.394 --> 01:09:31.855]  Disappointing economic data raises prospect of pre-election recession.
[01:09:32.195 --> 01:09:32.835]  Bidenomics.
[01:09:32.875 --> 01:09:35.456]  Historic surge in corporate bankruptcies across the U.S.
[01:09:36.076 --> 01:09:38.238]  So they're trying to claim the economy's really great.
[01:09:38.639 --> 01:09:40.921]  Massive exodus accelerating out of blue states.
[01:09:41.261 --> 01:09:43.763]  Chevron leaving California to Texas.
[01:09:44.864 --> 01:09:48.047]  We'll get into all the points you sent me when I asked you to come on last night.
[01:09:48.428 --> 01:09:52.752]  Got a huge stack of key points we're going to get to, but this right here, what does this say?
[01:09:56.474 --> 01:09:59.575]  You look at what's happening with not just the U.S.
[01:09:59.595 --> 01:10:01.036]  stock markets, right?
[01:10:01.816 --> 01:10:04.997]  So the Nasdaq, you know, it dipped below $17,000.
[01:10:06.118 --> 01:10:07.178]  I'm not a technical guy.
[01:10:07.198 --> 01:10:08.759]  I'm not a financial advisor.
[01:10:08.799 --> 01:10:10.679]  I'm not an analyst, right?
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:15.821]  But I do know that $17,000 is a very strong technical support level.
[01:10:15.881 --> 01:10:21.083]  And if you violate that, it's like, uh-oh, look out below, right?
[01:10:21.123 --> 01:10:21.904]  And so we're like $16,700 on Nasdaq.
[01:10:21.944 --> 01:10:22.284]  It's collapsing.
[01:10:26.186 --> 01:10:32.256]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average today, as we record this, is down like 900 points, almost 1,000.
[01:10:32.316 --> 01:10:33.738]  Let me interrupt you.
[01:10:34.019 --> 01:10:37.024]  Some of the top tech people for the last month have been dumping tech stocks.
[01:10:40.051 --> 01:10:43.314]  They've been dumping them and it's like, is this insider trading?
[01:10:43.454 --> 01:10:44.615]  Do they know what's coming?
[01:10:44.655 --> 01:10:46.397]  Do they just feel that it's overbought?
[01:10:46.557 --> 01:10:48.639]  Or are they smarter than that?
[01:10:48.779 --> 01:10:51.862]  And they know that there's something else coming in the economy.
[01:10:52.423 --> 01:10:57.708]  They want to get out of out of Dodge now because Alex, there's two reasons why people sell stuff.
[01:10:57.728 --> 01:10:59.749]  You know, if you're an investor,
[01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:04.371]  And prices are where they are right now, and you're expecting them to go lower?
[01:11:04.771 --> 01:11:10.653]  You're gonna sell it right now, because you want to lock in your profits before it gets lower.
[01:11:11.173 --> 01:11:15.134]  Or you sell things because you simply need money, right?
[01:11:15.554 --> 01:11:17.794]  So be either one of those.
[01:11:18.054 --> 01:11:23.816]  Either people need money, they have to liquidate to survive, or they simply want to lock in their profits.
[01:11:23.856 --> 01:11:27.477]  The people in the know, the people that are smart, the hedge fund managers, the big bankers,
[01:11:28.297 --> 01:11:30.624]  The bottom line, they're moving towards the exits.
[01:11:31.165 --> 01:11:32.509]  What does that signify to you?
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:39.885]  Well, it signifies what we've talked about for the last nine months.
[01:11:40.586 --> 01:11:42.327]  A recession isn't coming.
[01:11:42.448 --> 01:11:43.609]  A recession is already here.
[01:11:43.909 --> 01:11:47.232]  We've been in a recession in America since COVID, since March of 2020.
[01:11:47.452 --> 01:11:54.939]  Now, mainstream media and the financial news channels are saying, ooh, we're about to head into a recession.
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:57.061]  This is gonna be a pretty ugly period for America.
[01:11:57.082 --> 01:11:58.042]  It's like, you morons.
[01:11:58.783 --> 01:12:02.425]  A recession is two quarters of declining output.
[01:12:02.805 --> 01:12:07.208]  We've had declining output since March of 2020 during COVID.
[01:12:07.848 --> 01:12:10.590]  We're in the thick of a recession.
[01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:14.332]  But now people are starting to talk about this, right?
[01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:15.953]  And so perception is reality.
[01:12:16.373 --> 01:12:18.594]  So now we're starting to see sell-offs, right?
[01:12:18.675 --> 01:12:23.017]  So the Japanese stock market yesterday came down 6%.
[01:12:24.983 --> 01:12:28.584]  Right, you've got the Israeli stock market came down almost 6%.
[01:12:30.384 --> 01:12:34.545]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average down today like almost a thousand points.
[01:12:34.645 --> 01:12:36.586]  NASDAQ down, S&P 500 down.
[01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:43.867]  If you look at a summary, you know, graph of all the different stock markets throughout the world, they're all red.
[01:12:44.087 --> 01:12:45.748]  And by the way, I can pull these clips up.
[01:12:46.408 --> 01:12:51.769]  You like six months ago, we got to find these people, you know, people really only believe something that was said before it happens.
[01:12:52.881 --> 01:12:53.763]  Was it three months ago?
[01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:54.464]  Six months ago?
[01:12:54.745 --> 01:13:03.043]  You've said a bunch in the past that you're looking by August, September, that you were thinking a major stock market correction.
[01:13:03.063 --> 01:13:03.744]  I remember you saying that.
[01:13:04.946 --> 01:13:09.209]  Yeah, because normally you have like an October surprise, right?
[01:13:09.429 --> 01:13:12.491]  Where the stock market, you know, comes down hard.
[01:13:12.991 --> 01:13:17.855]  Well, I don't know why they call it a surprise because everyone expects that it's going to happen in October.
[01:13:18.275 --> 01:13:18.435]  Right.
[01:13:18.455 --> 01:13:29.462]  But I think this year it's going to happen sooner because it's an election year, because we've got so much turmoil geopolitically with wars and rumors of wars and now the Middle East on fire.
[01:13:29.482 --> 01:13:31.504]  And you've got China and Taiwan.
[01:13:31.544 --> 01:13:33.025]  You've got Russia and Ukraine.
[01:13:33.065 --> 01:13:34.666]  You've got all this stuff happening.
[01:13:35.306 --> 01:13:38.547]  You've got banks that are undercapitalized, right?
[01:13:38.687 --> 01:13:45.549]  And okay, so that article that you have on the screen with the Dow down 500, that was before the markets opened today.
[01:13:45.769 --> 01:13:47.530]  I mean, that was like three hours ago.
[01:13:47.650 --> 01:13:50.171]  Now, it's down like almost a thousand.
[01:13:50.831 --> 01:13:53.752]  I mean, so this is how quick things are starting to move.
[01:13:54.212 --> 01:13:55.752]  But what are they seeing?
[01:13:55.992 --> 01:14:01.254]  When you see not just one market index, but across the globe,
[01:14:01.974 --> 01:14:03.177]  Everything is coming down.
[01:14:03.819 --> 01:14:04.179]  Why?
[01:14:04.841 --> 01:14:06.084]  Why did they come down today?
[01:14:06.164 --> 01:14:11.155]  Is it just because of the job numbers report that came out that were abysmal?
[01:14:11.943 --> 01:14:18.007]  I mean, even in Bidenomics where they lie about everything, they couldn't come up with a big enough lie to cover this.
[01:14:18.047 --> 01:14:19.468]  The job numbers were really bad.
[01:14:19.588 --> 01:14:20.889]  Way worse than expected.
[01:14:21.309 --> 01:14:25.312]  The job growth isn't there, which this isn't rocket science, Alex.
[01:14:25.332 --> 01:14:30.055]  So it's a no-brainer that the Federal Reserve to stop inflation, squeeze the economy too much.
[01:14:30.635 --> 01:14:33.417]  Will they follow the Bank of England then imminently and cut interest rates?
[01:14:34.793 --> 01:14:39.535]  Well, I think they're going to have to to stay competitive with them, right?
[01:14:39.715 --> 01:14:42.537]  And then that's going to increase commodity prices of silver and gold.
[01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:45.098]  Yeah, so it will.
[01:14:45.699 --> 01:14:52.962]  So here's the story that you're going to hear, the narrative on mainstream media, and there's an opposite reality of what it's really going to do.
[01:14:53.642 --> 01:14:55.844]  So you're hearing the narrative already.
[01:14:56.324 --> 01:15:00.206]  The Bank of England, the Czech Central Bank.
[01:15:00.706 --> 01:15:06.509]  The Fed, when Jerome Powell spoke earlier in the week and said, we're going to lower rates in September, probably, right?
[01:15:06.569 --> 01:15:09.430]  Because we're winning this war against inflation.
[01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:11.871]  Therefore, we can lower interest rates.
[01:15:12.271 --> 01:15:16.794]  That's not the true reality of what's going on and why they're doing it.
[01:15:17.234 --> 01:15:19.175]  Now, that's what they want the public to think.
[01:15:19.935 --> 01:15:29.401]  But in reality, we've got so much debt, consumers don't have enough money to spend, that they have to weigh out this weird balance.
[01:15:30.142 --> 01:15:38.087]  And this is why now recession, they think recession is coming, because you have to lower rates to try to stimulate the economy, right?
[01:15:38.127 --> 01:15:41.789]  This is where the rest of the world is looking right now.
[01:15:41.849 --> 01:15:42.290]  But to me,
[01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:48.616]  You've got rising delinquencies, rising bankruptcies, corporate real estates that's falling apart.
[01:15:49.157 --> 01:15:53.121]  They have to do this once, at least once, to save face.
[01:15:53.542 --> 01:15:54.422]  But here's the problem.
[01:15:55.117 --> 01:15:59.838]  They do it to try to stimulate the economy, to get people to borrow and spend money.
[01:16:00.719 --> 01:16:03.820]  But we don't have any excess money to spend.
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:06.580]  I don't care if rates go all the way down to zero again.
[01:16:07.281 --> 01:16:08.641]  America's tapped out.
[01:16:08.761 --> 01:16:10.061]  The world is tapped out.
[01:16:10.542 --> 01:16:16.663]  So the more you lower rates, the more that inflation persists and everything is going to cost more money for people.
[01:16:17.284 --> 01:16:18.344]  This is the problem.
[01:16:18.664 --> 01:16:20.627]  There's only your prognosis.
[01:16:20.787 --> 01:16:24.633]  You've been dead on about what's about to happen next, but let me just put this plug out right up front.
[01:16:24.673 --> 01:16:26.075]  I'm 100% naked about this.
[01:16:26.476 --> 01:16:26.976]  I'm proud of it.
[01:16:28.178 --> 01:16:31.643]  I've not had a gold sponsor in 10, 11, I think it's 12 years because
[01:16:33.968 --> 01:16:39.611]  Gold and silver is a great thing to be in, but people are greedy and they want to put a big markup on it.
[01:16:39.651 --> 01:16:40.271]  I won't do that.
[01:16:40.291 --> 01:16:42.112]  I want to sell silver and gold bullion.
[01:16:42.732 --> 01:16:45.813]  And so for 12 years, I've not had a sponsor.
[01:16:46.374 --> 01:16:49.555]  You're the top silver guy now because you've done such a great job over 25 years.
[01:16:49.575 --> 01:16:50.876]  You're not even pushing gold.
[01:16:51.836 --> 01:16:55.538]  And I mean, look, just recently I've been offered a million dollars a month.
[01:16:55.578 --> 01:16:56.398]  It would save the company.
[01:16:56.958 --> 01:16:57.899]  It would be all the money we needed.
[01:16:57.919 --> 01:17:01.660]  A million bucks a month to go with these companies that charge people 30-40%.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:02.941]  They rip them off.
[01:17:03.221 --> 01:17:04.061]  I won't be part of it.
[01:17:05.382 --> 01:17:10.744]  And so there's this weird paradox where here is KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:17:10.764 --> 01:17:12.424]  You go to that URL, we get the support.
[01:17:13.445 --> 01:17:17.026]  And you're a real company with like, you know, 4.7, you know, star.
[01:17:20.170 --> 01:17:22.745]  Ready to actually deliver it to people.
[01:17:24.082 --> 01:17:26.264]  And it's a no-brainer.
[01:17:26.984 --> 01:17:30.967]  And sure, then, you can only do so much sponsorship because your profit's so small.
[01:17:31.588 --> 01:17:33.950]  They can sell it back to you for no cost.
[01:17:33.970 --> 01:17:36.251]  That is the huge thing that nobody who's big does.
[01:17:36.892 --> 01:17:37.652]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:17:38.013 --> 01:17:38.973]  People need to call you.
[01:17:39.314 --> 01:17:40.314]  They need to get into silver.
[01:17:40.354 --> 01:17:45.058]  If they got into silver a year ago, three years ago, gold, any of it, look at it, folks.
[01:17:45.158 --> 01:17:46.839]  It's the no-brainer.
[01:17:46.959 --> 01:17:51.383]  I only sell, like, a high-quality water filter, highest rated, for half the price of the competitor.
[01:17:51.903 --> 01:17:54.266]  I guess I should sell it like they sell it expensive.
[01:17:54.286 --> 01:17:55.527]  I wouldn't have financial issues.
[01:17:55.567 --> 01:18:01.093]  I just have this thing where I want to sell people stuff at the very best price I can.
[01:18:01.113 --> 01:18:05.717]  We can sell you crap vitamins, you know, for a third the price that are synthetic and aren't good for you.
[01:18:05.918 --> 01:18:07.219]  We pay a lot because they're the best.
[01:18:07.579 --> 01:18:09.962]  That's my philosophy and God's blessed me because of it.
[01:18:10.302 --> 01:18:11.603]  But you're a great sponsor.
[01:18:12.384 --> 01:18:13.385]  People need to get ready.
[01:18:13.706 --> 01:18:14.707]  They need to get silver.
[01:18:14.747 --> 01:18:15.488]  They need to get gold.
[01:18:15.528 --> 01:18:18.752]  They need to call you at 720-605-3900 and they need to do a consultation.
[01:18:23.146 --> 01:18:27.130]  And then boom, it is the wholesale price.
[01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:29.211]  It is not some scam.
[01:18:29.252 --> 01:18:38.159]  You can check the price of gold and silver, and that's it with 8% on it, folks, with all the consulting that goes with it, and then you can sell it back for nothing, and that is incredibly valuable.
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:42.964]  So everybody should go to KEPM.com forward slash Alex, and call the number 720-605-3100 now, because
[01:18:47.147 --> 01:18:50.230]  I mean, I only try to go with what I think is a sure bet, and I'm rarely wrong.
[01:18:50.591 --> 01:18:55.916]  Now I feel even better about this, and I already felt great, but then that's the good part.
[01:18:55.956 --> 01:18:58.898]  The bad part is, is because we're in such a crisis mode.
[01:18:58.938 --> 01:19:09.948]  So I want to get back to the economy and the huge amount of data you sent me, because you hardly ever even plug your company, but spend a few minutes talking about what you think people should do, how much silver's gone up, how much gold's gone up in the last few years.
[01:19:10.769 --> 01:19:14.415]  Right now, give people a pitch because this is as close as a shirt thing there is.
[01:19:14.475 --> 01:19:15.476]  It's not a panacea.
[01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:17.580]  Nothing's perfect but a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[01:19:18.201 --> 01:19:20.104]  But boom, this is important to make the move right now.
[01:19:22.074 --> 01:19:22.394]  It is.
[01:19:22.494 --> 01:19:31.058]  So, we've had meetings all week long, Alex, on what happens when we transition out of silver and into gold, because we ultimately will.
[01:19:31.458 --> 01:19:33.819]  So, begs the question, why are we in silver right now?
[01:19:33.879 --> 01:19:35.679]  Because it's doing better, right?
[01:19:35.719 --> 01:19:36.780]  It's outperforming.
[01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:46.364]  And when you buy bullion, which is the lowest cost that you can get, that's one of the keys to wealth, is buy low, sell high.
[01:19:46.404 --> 01:19:49.205]  But JPMorgan and all the, they're buying gold hand over fist.
[01:19:50.848 --> 01:19:53.790]  They're buying gold hand over fist, and gold's not a bad investment.
[01:19:54.511 --> 01:19:55.591]  It's doing well.
[01:19:55.912 --> 01:19:58.173]  I mean, it's near an all-time high.
[01:19:58.814 --> 01:20:03.337]  Earlier this morning, it surpassed $2,500 an ounce, right?
[01:20:03.457 --> 01:20:08.361]  And estimates from Citibank and others are it's going to go over $3,000 an ounce in 2025.
[01:20:08.681 --> 01:20:11.823]  It's growing, but silver is growing faster.
[01:20:11.943 --> 01:20:14.185]  So we've had meetings all week long.
[01:20:14.545 --> 01:20:34.424]  With the depository, you know, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars, Alex, on technology for this ratio trade that's coming, because when the ratio between gold and silver goes from 80 to 1 to 60 to 1, we can unload some of the silver, roll it into gold, and we compound the number of ounces of gold
[01:20:34.904 --> 01:20:36.764]  That you could have owned from today till then.
[01:20:37.044 --> 01:20:38.065]  That's free gold, right?
[01:20:38.145 --> 01:20:40.605]  It's extra ounces that you didn't have to pay for.
[01:20:41.065 --> 01:20:42.125]  And then we'll do that again.
[01:20:42.465 --> 01:21:02.969]  So the technology that we are setting up right now, months before this is ever going to happen, so when that time comes, we're going to capitalize on it quickly for all of our clients because, and at some point, we will be 100% into gold, and then we'll be compounding our ounces back into silver in the other direction.
[01:21:03.029 --> 01:21:03.831]  But that's my question.
[01:21:03.972 --> 01:21:07.542]  Obviously, silver's doing way better than gold in growth, and it's way undervalued.
[01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:08.264]  That's a fact.
[01:21:08.725 --> 01:21:10.851]  Why then are the central banks mainly hoarding gold?
[01:21:12.383 --> 01:21:14.964]  Well, because there's simply not enough silver, right?
[01:21:15.024 --> 01:21:27.388]  It's like, if you've got central banks that start allocating into silver when it's $30 an ounce and they want to have it be part of their reserves, it's like, okay, there's not enough silver in the world to do that, right?
[01:21:27.428 --> 01:21:33.130]  So they have to do gold because it's $2,400 an ounce, not $30 an ounce, right?
[01:21:33.190 --> 01:21:35.811]  So this is why central banks own gold.
[01:21:35.831 --> 01:21:41.733]  They've got so many quadrillions of fake money, there's too much fiat to even buy the silver.
[01:21:42.273 --> 01:21:45.834]  Which I would say then means silver still will always be the thing that grows the most.
[01:22:02.819 --> 01:22:05.680]  Barometers to government distrust, right?
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:10.020]  The worse things get, the better financial metals do.
[01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:11.401]  They're a flight for safety.
[01:22:11.801 --> 01:22:16.161]  But what silver has that gold doesn't is it's a manufacturing metal.
[01:22:16.221 --> 01:22:17.622]  It's used in industry.
[01:22:18.202 --> 01:22:23.763]  So in aerospace, in defense, in electronics, in solar power, electric vehicles, all of that.
[01:22:24.203 --> 01:22:29.184]  The demand for silver is through the roof, Alex, and we're just taking advantage of that
[01:22:29.904 --> 01:22:37.572]  And imagine what silver will do with Trump being president, somebody who actually grows the economy rather than having a stagnant economy.
[01:22:37.973 --> 01:22:42.117]  The industrial need for silver is absolutely going to explode.
[01:22:42.297 --> 01:22:42.778]  Now, you're right.
[01:22:42.858 --> 01:22:44.720]  Silver is the closest thing to a silver bullet.
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:46.321]  That's why they call it a silver bullet.
[01:22:46.341 --> 01:22:49.865]  People should go to KPM.com forward slash gold right now and get silver now.
[01:22:49.905 --> 01:22:50.346]  We'll be right back.
[01:22:50.967 --> 01:22:54.228]  This is a real attempt to turn America and the world around.
[01:22:54.248 --> 01:22:56.248]  This is a real attempt to stop World War III.
[01:22:56.269 --> 01:22:59.249]  This is a real attempt to save civilization for our children.
[01:22:59.469 --> 01:23:02.270]  Because there's not just evil in the world, there's good as well.
[01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:09.872]  And so you've got to decide that that's happening, and join it, and promote it, and support Trump, and support us, and spread the word.
[01:23:09.892 --> 01:23:14.474]  Because that's what they fear, is when you get a mission, and you get committed, and you take action.
[01:23:14.514 --> 01:23:16.274]  So tell everybody about the links at Reloaded Alex Jones.

[01:23:50.885 --> 01:23:53.267]  Well, we're not in Kansas anymore, as they say.
[01:23:53.287 --> 01:23:57.229]  We have a great economist and amazing researcher, Dr. Kirk Elliott, joining us.
[01:23:57.709 --> 01:23:59.170]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:23:59.891 --> 01:24:10.237]  You sent me a giant stack when I got like 27 minutes left of clips and analysis with Venezuela, the economy, the world, everything that's happening, Dr. Kirk Elliott.
[01:24:10.257 --> 01:24:17.042]  So and then we've got graphs I posted on X showing the same fraud in 2020 that Maduro did where
[01:24:17.782 --> 01:24:19.282]  We'll put all that on screen.
[01:24:19.962 --> 01:24:21.983]  Let's plow into all this research you sent me.
[01:24:23.543 --> 01:24:25.284]  So we'll start with Venezuela, right?
[01:24:25.344 --> 01:24:32.725]  Because this social mayhem, this uprising, these riots, the looting, the fires in the streets, right?
[01:24:33.465 --> 01:24:37.026]  We're probably going to see the same thing in November, right?
[01:24:37.066 --> 01:24:40.887]  Because that chart that showed what happened in Georgia
[01:24:41.647 --> 01:24:48.150]  And what happened in Venezuela, the timing of the votes that came in, it looks so similar, Alex.
[01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:53.612]  It's so similar that it's obvious that the election rigging, they learned.
[01:24:53.932 --> 01:24:55.373]  They learned from each other, right?
[01:24:55.393 --> 01:24:58.374]  Because the Venezuelan people didn't like Maduro.
[01:24:58.434 --> 01:24:59.015]  Why would they?
[01:24:59.035 --> 01:25:01.516]  They had a million percent inflation two years ago.
[01:25:01.556 --> 01:25:03.457]  Exit polls showed Gonzalez got 65 percent.
[01:25:05.438 --> 01:25:07.418]  Yeah, and people don't like Maduro.
[01:25:07.458 --> 01:25:09.159]  I mean, you wouldn't like him either.
[01:25:09.239 --> 01:25:14.200]  I wouldn't like him if we had to live in a country that had a million percent inflation in a year.
[01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:15.260]  A million!
[01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:16.960]  I mean, that's so much.
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:18.480]  So people couldn't afford to live.
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.381]  There's no way that this guy should have won, right?
[01:25:21.401 --> 01:25:24.601]  But that shows me that there's massive election fraud, right?
[01:25:24.641 --> 01:25:27.442]  So if you can't win fair and square, you're going to have to do something like that.
[01:25:27.782 --> 01:25:28.562]  What does that bring?
[01:25:28.802 --> 01:25:31.363]  Chaos, uncertainty, distrust.
[01:25:31.783 --> 01:25:33.163]  That impacts the market.
[01:25:33.723 --> 01:25:40.487]  Right, so then we can actually transition moving into the banking world here in America.
[01:25:41.067 --> 01:25:57.537]  So if you look at what's been happening in the banks, so do you remember it was, I think it was in April, Republic First Bank in Pennsylvania went into FDIC receivership.
[01:25:57.817 --> 01:25:58.958]  They went out of business, right?
[01:25:58.998 --> 01:26:00.999]  And so Fulton Bank bought them.
[01:26:01.772 --> 01:26:03.013]  Well, here's the problem.
[01:26:04.334 --> 01:26:09.737]  Why would they buy something that was so toxic that they had to go into FDIC receivership?
[01:26:10.198 --> 01:26:12.419]  Well, they thought, oh man, we can get this at a discount, right?
[01:26:12.459 --> 01:26:14.861]  But no, you're buying something toxic.
[01:26:15.321 --> 01:26:19.224]  It's just like dropping a couple drops of poison into a fresh glass of water.
[01:26:19.364 --> 01:26:20.564]  It taints the whole well.
[01:26:20.985 --> 01:26:28.630]  So they added all these toxic assets into their balance sheet, made that Fulton Bank toxic, and just this morning,
[01:26:29.130 --> 01:26:37.595]  The news came out that now Fulton Bank is having, you know, financial disarray, and they're gonna have to close 18- What you predicted nine months ago would happen.
[01:26:38.504 --> 01:26:38.844]  I did.
[01:26:38.864 --> 01:26:39.685]  I did.
[01:26:39.705 --> 01:26:45.507]  It's like 18 banks' branches are closing because they bought these toxic assets.
[01:26:46.048 --> 01:26:59.714]  When Silicon Valley Bank went down, Alex, and Credit Suisse and First Republic and Signature Bank and all those banks, I knew that this was going to happen again because they didn't fix the problem.
[01:27:00.234 --> 01:27:03.236]  They put a Band-Aid on it and they threw stimulus money at it.
[01:27:04.036 --> 01:27:06.038]  Called the Bank Temp Funding Program.
[01:27:06.598 --> 01:27:14.526]  So banks couldn't go into FDIC receivership because FDIC only has 1.17% of all deposits covered.
[01:27:15.066 --> 01:27:20.952]  And you've played that clip numerous times of the stupid FDIC meeting where they're kind of giggling in the background.
[01:27:20.992 --> 01:27:24.835]  It's like, oh, the people trust us more than we trust ourselves.
[01:27:24.895 --> 01:27:26.637]  We can't let this story go out.
[01:27:27.057 --> 01:27:27.357]  Right?
[01:27:27.397 --> 01:27:28.778]  This would cause a run on the banks.
[01:27:28.918 --> 01:27:29.619]  And they're right.
[01:27:30.019 --> 01:27:32.201]  But FDIC is so underfunded.
[01:27:32.681 --> 01:27:39.647]  Now that bank temp funding program expired at sunset, now we're seeing banks starting to fail again.
[01:27:40.127 --> 01:27:40.307]  Right?
[01:27:40.347 --> 01:27:42.389]  Because of what's happening in the economy.
[01:27:42.429 --> 01:27:51.696]  When you have low wages, you have high inflation, you have high taxes, you have high interest rates, delinquencies on people's loans that's going to default.
[01:27:52.376 --> 01:27:54.237]  Banks are going to fail, Alex.
[01:27:54.257 --> 01:27:58.039]  There's going to be another run of banks, and I'm not a prophet.
[01:27:58.079 --> 01:27:59.480]  This is just math, right?
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:04.403]  We are going to see banks continue to fail moving forward.
[01:28:04.463 --> 01:28:06.484]  So who else knows this?
[01:28:07.204 --> 01:28:09.325]  Who else knows that these banks are going to fail?
[01:28:09.345 --> 01:28:12.347]  How about Warren Buffett, right?
[01:28:12.847 --> 01:28:16.049]  So actions speak louder than words, right?
[01:28:16.069 --> 01:28:17.950]  So you look at what Warren Buffett has done.
[01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:19.311]  Berkshire Hathaway
[01:28:20.211 --> 01:28:27.277]  They're one of their largest, basically owned assets that they have in the company was Bank of America.
[01:28:28.178 --> 01:28:37.185]  So they sold in the last 12 days, Warren Buffett sold $3.8 billion of Bank of America shares.
[01:28:37.706 --> 01:28:44.291]  You got to ask yourself, how could the Oracle of Omaha, you know, one of the smartest investors ever known, right?
[01:28:44.351 --> 01:28:48.135]  It's like, why would he be selling something if he thought it was going to go up?
[01:28:49.005 --> 01:28:51.766]  Right, so he doesn't think it's going to go up.
[01:28:52.186 --> 01:28:53.447]  That's why he's selling it.
[01:28:54.007 --> 01:28:59.209]  So he's getting rid of the banking shares, which tells me, hmm, we might be on to something, Alex.
[01:28:59.229 --> 01:29:07.212]  When you and I have been talking about more bank failures coming, he's getting rid of the second largest holding that Berkshire Hathaway had, which is Bank of America.
[01:29:07.572 --> 01:29:09.233]  But that's not all he's getting rid of.
[01:29:09.893 --> 01:29:12.595]  So, he's selling Apple shares, right?
[01:29:12.655 --> 01:29:14.536]  He loves Bank of America.
[01:29:14.596 --> 01:29:15.957]  He loved his Apple shares.
[01:29:15.997 --> 01:29:19.759]  He's held them for a long time, and he's starting to dump these things.
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:20.580]  Why?
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:24.102]  I don't think it has anything to do with Apple.
[01:29:24.142 --> 01:29:27.784]  It has to do with the bigger, broader economy, right?
[01:29:27.824 --> 01:29:33.508]  Which is, he's expecting something big and bad and ugly and corrective to happen.
[01:29:33.568 --> 01:29:36.850]  And instead, like Bill Gates, he's moving into farmland.
[01:29:39.096 --> 01:29:45.760]  Moving into farmland and sitting in cash, which is a stupid thing for him to do because banks are going to fail, right?
[01:29:45.801 --> 01:29:51.344]  So you can't sit on top of that much cash because how much cash does he have?
[01:29:52.125 --> 01:29:53.005]  Record levels.
[01:29:53.286 --> 01:29:56.288]  He's now sitting on almost two hundred
[01:29:57.128 --> 01:29:58.609]  Billion dollars worth of cash.
[01:29:58.649 --> 01:30:00.690]  It's like, oh my word, that's a lot of cash.
[01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:07.873]  So when he's sitting on that much cash and doesn't have it allocated into companies, because what does Warren Buffett do?
[01:30:07.913 --> 01:30:09.354]  What's his investment style?
[01:30:09.854 --> 01:30:13.476]  He's a value investor, not a values investor.
[01:30:13.496 --> 01:30:14.696]  I don't think he could care less.
[01:30:14.776 --> 01:30:15.977]  He's a value investor.
[01:30:15.997 --> 01:30:18.598]  I mean, he wants to buy things at a discount.
[01:30:19.479 --> 01:30:21.139]  And so he wants to sit in cash.
[01:30:21.179 --> 01:30:23.040]  He's getting ready for the fire sale.
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:24.181]  He's getting ready for the fire sale.
[01:30:24.201 --> 01:30:24.321]  Yeah.
[01:30:25.424 --> 01:30:29.047]  He wants to go into the fire sale and buy things at a discount.
[01:30:29.107 --> 01:30:31.569]  But he's sitting in too much money in cash.
[01:30:31.709 --> 01:30:34.192]  I wouldn't have that much money in the banks.
[01:30:34.432 --> 01:30:35.873]  Where is he holding it?
[01:30:36.353 --> 01:30:39.816]  Because banks are undercapitalized, FDIC is underinsured.
[01:30:40.137 --> 01:30:43.179]  Now, when you're dealing with billions of dollars, FDIC, who cares?
[01:30:43.219 --> 01:30:43.940]  That has a $250,000 limit.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:44.360]  But the point is,
[01:30:47.463 --> 01:30:58.892]  He's got money into a system that is about to fail, and he sees the other system that's about to fail, which are the normal stock market, as overall overarching.
[01:30:59.332 --> 01:30:59.632]  Why?
[01:30:59.912 --> 01:31:01.553]  Because the economy stinks.
[01:31:02.134 --> 01:31:03.955]  And I agree with you, so let me just pause there.
[01:31:04.836 --> 01:31:06.077]  We can't play this clip enough.
[01:31:06.137 --> 01:31:06.937]  This is a year ago.
[01:31:06.957 --> 01:31:11.000]  This is the FDIC, Federal Depositor Insurance Corporation, meeting.
[01:31:12.061 --> 01:31:12.862]  They're so arrogant.
[01:31:12.922 --> 01:31:13.662]  It's a public record.
[01:31:13.702 --> 01:31:14.383]  It's being recorded.
[01:31:14.903 --> 01:31:15.404]  They don't care.
[01:31:15.444 --> 01:31:16.444]  They say, don't tell the public.
[01:31:17.247 --> 01:31:19.608]  But we're about to grab their bank accounts with bail-ins.
[01:31:21.329 --> 01:31:22.369]  Here they are admitting it.
[01:31:22.969 --> 01:31:26.471]  I would think something like this itself would cause bank runs, but they're so arrogant.
[01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:27.271]  Here's the clip.
[01:31:29.192 --> 01:31:32.914]  Whether there are some market tests of whether you're being heard.
[01:31:33.574 --> 01:31:34.835]  And I think about TLAC.
[01:31:35.915 --> 01:31:42.558]  So, TLAC should... Spread should respond to good and bad news.
[01:31:43.448 --> 01:31:44.729]  about the institutions.
[01:31:44.809 --> 01:31:46.130]  And it's really important.
[01:31:46.150 --> 01:31:48.432]  I mean, it's a little bit conflicted, right?
[01:31:48.492 --> 01:31:54.957]  I mean, it's important that people understand they can be bailed in, but you don't want a huge run on the institution.
[01:31:55.037 --> 01:32:06.045]  But they have I mean, they're going to be that's and and it could be an early warning signal to the FDIC and the primary regulators when these things happen.
[01:32:06.085 --> 01:32:07.266]  And there may be some other
[01:32:08.191 --> 01:32:20.761]  Prices, this is similar to what Jay was saying, in the market that you can tell whether people understand who's going to be protected, who isn't going to be protected.
[01:32:20.781 --> 01:32:33.070]  It would be, I think, an interesting study to look at the evolution of market prices in a situation like March of 2020, for example, and see whether people understood what might happen.
[01:32:34.346 --> 01:32:38.368]  And the next part, he goes on and says, maybe we shouldn't tell the public this.
[01:32:38.588 --> 01:32:40.288]  So that's an hour-long deal.
[01:32:40.968 --> 01:32:43.809]  But imagine, folks, where we are.
[01:32:43.849 --> 01:32:45.850]  They said the bail-ins will happen.
[01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:49.091]  They will grab part of your bank account and create this unified ledger.
[01:32:49.131 --> 01:32:50.331]  We're going into this.
[01:32:50.832 --> 01:32:54.533]  They're just getting deck chairs rearranged here and ready for this.
[01:32:55.253 --> 01:32:57.995]  And they want to keep putting it off, but they can't with these interest rate cuts.
[01:32:58.395 --> 01:33:00.117]  But I mean, this is just amazing.
[01:33:00.237 --> 01:33:02.018]  So they can't stop inflation.
[01:33:02.398 --> 01:33:05.761]  They try to crush the economy to stop inflation, but that creates stag inflation.
[01:33:07.244 --> 01:33:23.340]  Yeah, I mean, we're, stagflation for everybody who was alive and can remember in the late 1970s, Carter's administration, outside of Biden, the worst economic president that I think America has ever seen, right?
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.841]  Because you had, what did you have?
[01:33:25.201 --> 01:33:29.886]  You had a recession, stores couldn't afford to stay open, people, the inflation was 14.3%.
[01:33:32.268 --> 01:33:33.930]  That it was out of control.
[01:33:33.970 --> 01:33:36.152]  There was rationing at the gas pumps, right?
[01:33:36.272 --> 01:33:39.575]  Everything was wrong with America at that time, economically.
[01:33:40.216 --> 01:33:43.579]  Reagan came in, slowed down the inflation by jacking up interest rates to 18%.
[01:33:44.199 --> 01:33:47.222]  Remember, if you had a mortgage back then... Paul Volcker!
[01:33:48.964 --> 01:33:49.424]  What's that?
[01:33:49.544 --> 01:33:49.985]  Keep going.
[01:33:51.815 --> 01:33:55.738]  Oh, in 1983, interest rates were 18%.
[01:33:55.858 --> 01:33:56.099]  Why?
[01:33:56.119 --> 01:33:58.180]  To slow down inflation.
[01:33:58.220 --> 01:34:03.905]  So this is why I think when they talk about rate cuts right now, it's a pipe dream.
[01:34:04.265 --> 01:34:07.188]  They might do it once to save face, but they have to go up.
[01:34:07.448 --> 01:34:10.711]  Because unofficially, this is what I did in my dissertation on one of them.
[01:34:11.991 --> 01:34:18.273]  Is inflationary pressures are now hovering at around 15 percent, not three point something.
[01:34:18.533 --> 01:34:21.374]  Those are artificially held low for political reasons.
[01:34:21.854 --> 01:34:23.375]  Your wallet will tell us more than that.
[01:34:23.415 --> 01:34:28.696]  So interest rates have to go sky high when you have higher prices, higher cost of borrowing.
[01:34:28.956 --> 01:34:30.137]  People aren't working.
[01:34:30.557 --> 01:34:33.918]  Wage growth is down, which the numbers this morning talked about.
[01:34:34.398 --> 01:34:35.618]  That's stagflation.
[01:34:35.659 --> 01:34:39.060]  That is a policy nightmare for a politician.
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:41.380]  How do you fix that?
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:42.881]  It's really hard to get out of that.
[01:34:43.001 --> 01:34:46.002]  So we've got more pain coming in the economy.
[01:34:46.042 --> 01:35:01.129]  But now, couple all of that, these economic puzzle pieces, right, with now geopolitical landscape that's happening and the wars and the rumors of wars and everything that's happening and people operating in fear.
[01:35:01.649 --> 01:35:03.610]  And you look at what's happening in Israel.
[01:35:03.650 --> 01:35:08.712]  The Middle East, Alex, is about to go up in flames, in my opinion.
[01:35:08.892 --> 01:35:12.637]  Oh, mainline analysts say it's about to go full regional war, bare minimum.
[01:35:13.439 --> 01:35:13.999]  Full-on.
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:14.780]  And the U.S.
[01:35:14.821 --> 01:35:17.604]  attacks Iran, Russia says they're going to back them.
[01:35:17.725 --> 01:35:18.406]  This is biblical.
[01:35:19.585 --> 01:35:22.646]  This is, so that's no longer a regional war.
[01:35:22.767 --> 01:35:29.370]  This could escalate into something even bigger when you look at who is Israel fighting against right now.
[01:35:30.710 --> 01:35:35.072]  It's not just a country, it's an ideology that they're fighting against, right?
[01:35:35.112 --> 01:35:44.617]  So you've got Hamas, you've got Hezbollah, you've got ISIS, you've got Taliban, you've got all the countries involved, whether it's Palestine or Syria or Lebanon or Iran.
[01:35:44.757 --> 01:35:46.838]  All of these kind of go back to Iran.
[01:35:47.318 --> 01:35:50.542]  Well, here's the funny thing about that, in a not-so-funny sort of way.
[01:35:51.242 --> 01:35:54.025]  What happened with Iran earlier in the year, in January?
[01:35:54.326 --> 01:36:03.275]  They were admitted into the BRICS nations, where they now have economic and political support with the other BRICS nations, being China and Russia.
[01:36:03.996 --> 01:36:04.496]  Right?
[01:36:04.917 --> 01:36:16.083]  So now, if Iran is funding all of these different terrorist groups, and this is the weird thing, is, you know, the Sunnis and the Shiite Muslims, they don't really get along, right?
[01:36:16.123 --> 01:36:22.907]  But now, under this common enemy, being the great Satan America, the little Satan Israel,
[01:36:23.627 --> 01:36:33.177]  They are going to band together, there's going to be unification, and I wouldn't be surprised if the black flag of jihad goes up all over mosques all over the world, and there's these attacks.
[01:36:33.197 --> 01:36:36.861]  But this is who Israel is fighting, and what did Russia do?
[01:36:37.302 --> 01:36:38.703]  What did Putin decide to do?
[01:36:38.723 --> 01:36:42.207]  It's like, we will fund Iran with
[01:36:43.288 --> 01:36:43.969]  Are you sure?
[01:36:58.450 --> 01:37:04.376]  Fear, absolute fear, gripping the hearts and minds of people, which could be very prophetic.
[01:37:04.636 --> 01:37:06.157]  This is in Revelation, right?
[01:37:06.218 --> 01:37:12.183]  So now you've got economic woes, you've got safety woes, you've got military.
[01:37:12.584 --> 01:37:14.045]  What's going to happen to Israel?
[01:37:14.445 --> 01:37:16.628]  Are we going to support Israel or not?
[01:37:17.148 --> 01:37:18.289]  I mean, here's the ugly thing.
[01:37:18.849 --> 01:37:34.122]  If Russia is giving Iran missiles and Israel's fighting battles to the north in Lebanon with Hezbollah, to the south and to the east against Hamas and the Houthis, it's like good grief, they're ultimately going to run out of weapons.
[01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:36.703]  Right, so are we then going to support them?
[01:37:36.743 --> 01:37:37.464]  What happens?
[01:37:38.024 --> 01:37:40.886]  This becomes a geopolitical nightmare.
[01:37:40.926 --> 01:37:41.767]  And now seven U.S.
[01:37:41.787 --> 01:37:43.448]  warships have entered the Mediterranean.
[01:37:43.968 --> 01:37:47.831]  So this is all because the world financial system is coming into a change.
[01:37:49.747 --> 01:37:58.670]  Yeah, they're coming into a huge change, and this economic change globally, China's on top of it, right?
[01:37:58.730 --> 01:37:59.450]  What did they do?
[01:37:59.870 --> 01:38:03.451]  They dumped $75 billion worth of U.S.
[01:38:03.511 --> 01:38:07.473]  treasuries in June, not just to make money, but to destroy the U.S.
[01:38:07.513 --> 01:38:07.873]  dollar.
[01:38:08.273 --> 01:38:09.233]  What did the U.S.
[01:38:09.273 --> 01:38:10.433]  have to do in response?
[01:38:10.794 --> 01:38:12.614]  Because who's buying those treasuries?
[01:38:12.994 --> 01:38:14.635]  The rest of the world doesn't want U.S.
[01:38:14.675 --> 01:38:16.735]  treasuries, so the Fed is buying them.
[01:38:16.755 --> 01:38:18.236]  They're the buyer of last resort.
[01:38:18.456 --> 01:38:18.997]  We're good to go.
[01:38:36.408 --> 01:38:36.888]  Three months?
[01:38:37.348 --> 01:38:40.090]  I think all this comes down before the election, right?
[01:38:40.130 --> 01:38:49.874]  It's like, because when you start then to add up some of the other fears, and this is why I say that, it's not just military, it's not just political, it's not just economic.
[01:38:50.194 --> 01:38:52.075]  We've got a health scare coming, right?
[01:38:52.715 --> 01:38:57.997]  When the former head of the CDC said, you know what, this bird flu thing, it's gonna be really bad.
[01:38:58.458 --> 01:39:01.259]  It's got a 20% mortality rate.
[01:39:01.919 --> 01:39:05.721]  One out of every five people is supposedly gonna- That means they've got that on the shelf ready to release it.
[01:39:06.755 --> 01:39:09.417]  Yeah, people are gonna die.
[01:39:09.517 --> 01:39:13.400]  One out of every five are gonna die from this thing, where COVID was only 0.2% or 0.6%.
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:16.502]  It's like, good grief, that's a lot more.
[01:39:17.063 --> 01:39:20.545]  So earlier this, well, it was actually last week, Alex.
[01:39:21.106 --> 01:39:23.267]  So I believe there's mandates coming.
[01:39:23.307 --> 01:39:25.069]  I have this article that I sent to you.
[01:39:25.129 --> 01:39:34.136]  So, Pandemic 2.0, the FDA to grant emergency use authorization for mRNA bird flu shots.
[01:39:34.716 --> 01:39:36.798]  I'm just like, what does this mean?
[01:39:37.298 --> 01:39:42.222]  So you've got this current procedural terminology.
[01:39:42.302 --> 01:39:46.125]  CPT is a long, stupid terminology.
[01:39:46.165 --> 01:39:47.326]  But basically, what is that?
[01:39:47.406 --> 01:39:48.406]  It's the protocols.
[01:39:48.927 --> 01:39:53.210]  When somebody has this bird flu, just like when somebody has COVID, what happens?
[01:39:53.530 --> 01:39:55.052]  Well, you have to have social distancing.
[01:39:55.072 --> 01:39:56.212]  You have to wear a mask.
[01:39:56.252 --> 01:39:57.153]  You can't travel.
[01:39:57.533 --> 01:40:02.797]  When people go into the hospital, they're going to give them something worse than the sickness itself that kills them, right?
[01:40:03.678 --> 01:40:05.519]  And nobody, your family can't know about it?
[01:40:05.739 --> 01:40:07.500]  These are the protocols that are put in place.
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:17.324]  So this emergency use procedural stuff that they've just put together, that tells us that it's now ready, right?
[01:40:17.364 --> 01:40:21.706]  They are getting ready for this bird flu to come during flu season.
[01:40:21.746 --> 01:40:24.828]  It's like, hmm, how does this unroll?
[01:40:25.268 --> 01:40:26.729]  I'm thinking out loud here, right?
[01:40:26.749 --> 01:40:30.851]  I'm not necessarily making a prediction, but I think either
[01:40:31.611 --> 01:40:37.013]  It comes out before the election, so it's so bad that people can't go out to vote.
[01:40:37.073 --> 01:40:39.354]  They're going to have to have mail-in ballots, right?
[01:40:39.694 --> 01:40:56.660]  Or, if they think that there's a shoo-in that Trump is going to win, let's unleash this nasty evil on the world right after the election so Trump now has to deal with this and his plans can't be implemented because the whole world is on lockdown and new mandates are coming, right?
[01:40:58.681 --> 01:41:01.483]  So I think that you add all of this together.
[01:41:02.103 --> 01:41:03.744]  Alex, this is the beginning of our show.
[01:41:04.125 --> 01:41:06.866]  This is physical manifestations of a spiritual battle.
[01:41:07.407 --> 01:41:08.747]  You've got health scares.
[01:41:08.988 --> 01:41:09.928]  You've got war.
[01:41:10.268 --> 01:41:14.011]  You've got economic scares and people are afraid that they're going to run out of money.
[01:41:14.471 --> 01:41:15.932]  You've got social decay.
[01:41:15.952 --> 01:41:17.013]  And you know what?
[01:41:17.073 --> 01:41:18.494]  I'm, you know, the Olympics, right?
[01:41:18.534 --> 01:41:19.995]  It's like I'm watching that and you've got
[01:41:20.635 --> 01:41:25.119]  This guy who punched out this girl, right?
[01:41:25.159 --> 01:41:26.560]  And it's like, where are all the feminists?
[01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:33.265]  It's like, you want women's sports and then you let a guy beat up a woman on international TV.
[01:41:33.345 --> 01:41:35.387]  It's like, what is going on in this world?
[01:41:35.747 --> 01:41:37.429]  And there's not an outcry about it?
[01:41:37.909 --> 01:41:38.810]  This is insane.
[01:41:39.150 --> 01:41:40.311]  It's insanity, right?
[01:41:40.371 --> 01:41:44.334]  So to me, all of these things paint into a bigger picture.
[01:41:44.374 --> 01:41:45.896]  And so we have to ask ourselves,
[01:41:46.556 --> 01:41:52.720]  How close are we to their final endgame, which is central bank digital currency?
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.882]  That is the monitoring arm, Alex.
[01:41:54.962 --> 01:41:56.603]  It's not just a banking thing.
[01:41:57.344 --> 01:42:05.129]  It's the monitoring arm to control people and their spending and what they can spend money on and ideologically based, right?
[01:42:05.169 --> 01:42:07.531]  We've talked about this numerous times, but
[01:42:08.271 --> 01:42:11.755]  Project Aurum at the Bank for International Settlements.
[01:42:12.235 --> 01:42:15.599]  So people can go to bis.org, right, and look it up.
[01:42:15.639 --> 01:42:16.720]  Type in Project Aurum.
[01:42:17.321 --> 01:42:18.202]  What does it say?
[01:42:18.822 --> 01:42:22.466]  It says, okay, we've got this central bank digital currency repository.
[01:42:22.526 --> 01:42:25.369]  This is everybody's digital assets in this bucket.
[01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:27.651]  And so we've talked about that.
[01:42:27.771 --> 01:42:34.734]  But what they what now they are doing is they're connecting it to decentralized cryptocurrency.
[01:42:34.774 --> 01:42:35.835]  Call it Bitcoin right.
[01:42:36.035 --> 01:42:39.377]  Any financial institution can issue some kind of a crypto token.
[01:42:39.897 --> 01:42:41.858]  So now they've got the interoperability.
[01:42:42.518 --> 01:42:43.639]  Alex, there is no escape.
[01:42:43.659 --> 01:42:47.824]  So when we read Revelation 13 and says every man, woman, and child has to have this mark to buy or sell,
[01:43:03.601 --> 01:43:13.830]  Because people have said, Kirk, well, decentralized cryptocurrency and like these decentralized wallets like Uniswap and other things, we're going to be able to actually have this parallel economy.
[01:43:14.351 --> 01:43:15.512]  I don't know if you can.
[01:43:16.192 --> 01:43:16.853]  Maybe you can.
[01:43:17.173 --> 01:43:17.874]  Maybe you can't.
[01:43:18.134 --> 01:43:28.764]  But this new project, ORM, is pulling decentralized and centralized cryptocurrency all together under a retail e-wallet that attaches to you.
[01:43:29.424 --> 01:43:39.959]  Which, based on World Economic Forum, is the ideologically based test and the unified ledger, which you've talked about, it's all of that wrapped into one.
[01:43:40.399 --> 01:43:46.447]  So the only way that you can escape a digital world is to have a tangible asset.
[01:43:47.088 --> 01:43:52.589]  Like silver, like gold, that's not digital, that can't be turned off with the flip of a switch.
[01:43:53.090 --> 01:44:01.792]  And all of this stuff is happening while everybody's distracted with an assassination attempt, with the Olympics and guys fighting girls.
[01:44:01.852 --> 01:44:05.833]  And then you've got these wars and rumors of wars and everything that's happening and bank failures.
[01:44:06.793 --> 01:44:11.895]  All of this stuff is happening behind the scenes and nobody is paying attention.
[01:44:11.915 --> 01:44:12.335]  Absolutely.
[01:44:12.375 --> 01:44:13.615]  So the number one thing is the relationship with God.
[01:44:13.635 --> 01:44:15.356]  And I think it's the most pivotal thing in the world.
[01:44:15.576 --> 01:44:15.836]  It is.
[01:44:15.856 --> 01:44:17.737]  The number one thing is the relationship with God and then family.
[01:44:17.757 --> 01:44:20.738]  If you've got a farm, if you can be self-sufficient in the community, that's key.
[01:44:20.758 --> 01:44:25.759]  But silver and gold is a no-brainer, but it's a minefield of bad companies.
[01:44:26.319 --> 01:44:28.100]  And again, folks, I could have the bad companies on.
[01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:29.400]  I know great people that have them on.
[01:44:29.921 --> 01:44:30.661]  I won't be part of it.
[01:44:32.335 --> 01:44:37.739]  Kirk will steal your right 8% on the silver on the gold, and then they let you sell it back for no cost.
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:39.341]  That is a huge value.
[01:44:39.661 --> 01:44:40.862]  You're gonna get great consultation.
[01:44:40.882 --> 01:44:44.785]  You need to call and get silver and gold, but silver mainly right now.
[01:44:45.546 --> 01:44:48.128]  Put the number on screen and just, you know,
[01:44:48.348 --> 01:44:54.990]  Do a quick consultation because they're going to really, you know, try to go through all that with you and just say, I'm ready to get into silver, and then it funds the operation.
[01:44:55.010 --> 01:44:56.531]  But you want silver, you want to hold it.
[01:44:56.891 --> 01:44:58.672]  KEPM.com forward slash gold 7206053900.
[01:44:58.832 --> 01:45:11.956]  But again, relationship with God, you know, family you can work with, storable foods, guns to protect yourself, and then silver and gold come along right after that.
[01:45:11.976 --> 01:45:15.137]  I mean, it's just absolutely one of the essential things out there.
[01:45:15.798 --> 01:45:16.398]  In closing,
[01:45:19.448 --> 01:45:21.291]  I don't think it's predictions that are going to come true.
[01:45:21.311 --> 01:45:22.693]  I think we're already in it, Kirk.
[01:45:22.753 --> 01:45:23.594]  I think this is it.
[01:45:23.614 --> 01:45:26.618]  I mean, this is going to be a spectacular time to be alive.
[01:45:26.979 --> 01:45:29.442]  Anybody that says they're bored right now must not be paying attention.
[01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:34.913]  Well, I don't think that, if they're bored, they aren't paying attention.
[01:45:35.233 --> 01:45:38.116]  And this is where we have to ask ourselves this very important question.
[01:45:38.176 --> 01:45:39.277]  Why are we alive right now?
[01:45:39.878 --> 01:45:40.038]  Right?
[01:45:40.078 --> 01:45:43.581]  Why didn't God create me 400 years ago or 400 years from now?
[01:45:43.741 --> 01:45:43.942]  No!
[01:45:44.362 --> 01:45:52.810]  He knit us together in our mother's womb, right here, right now, for this time in history, to make a difference, to be a light in the dark world, like we talked about earlier.
[01:45:55.433 --> 01:45:57.754]  Like Esther in the Bible, right?
[01:45:57.794 --> 01:46:00.855]  She saved her nation by putting her neck on the line.
[01:46:00.915 --> 01:46:05.657]  She could have been killed, but she spoke to the king, made her request.
[01:46:05.817 --> 01:46:07.958]  She could have been killed for that, but she didn't.
[01:46:08.298 --> 01:46:11.199]  She saved a nation for such a time as this, right?
[01:46:11.659 --> 01:46:13.560]  All of us are here for such a time as this.
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:14.820]  We better figure out why.
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:22.623]  Is it to be a light to the nation, to the world, to your neighborhood, just simply your neighbor or your own family?
[01:46:23.343 --> 01:46:44.467]  Start speaking the truth and bringing hope and don't live in the state of fear and don't let the things that that Alex you and I talk about When we're on the show, it's like it's just bad news if the world is full of bad news But you have to understand how bad it is so you can actually address it properly and do the right thing So it all starts with us
[01:46:44.747 --> 01:46:48.188]  Well, outside of these video walls here, right?
[01:46:48.829 --> 01:46:52.550]  We have to be hope to a lost and dying world.
[01:46:52.930 --> 01:46:54.191]  And it starts with our family.
[01:46:54.231 --> 01:46:55.291]  It starts with our neighbors.
[01:46:55.331 --> 01:47:00.913]  And then you can become politically active at the local level, at the state level, at the national level, right?
[01:47:00.993 --> 01:47:02.234]  Make your voice heard.
[01:47:02.774 --> 01:47:03.374]  But you know what?
[01:47:04.475 --> 01:47:04.995]  It takes
[01:47:05.695 --> 01:47:11.117]  You actually being able to survive financially to get to that point, because the economy is collapsing.
[01:47:11.477 --> 01:47:12.497]  That's why this is all interconnected.
[01:47:12.517 --> 01:47:18.959]  That's right, and when you're living in a historic time like this, you've got to admit the time you're in, and not deny it, and then take action.
[01:47:19.519 --> 01:47:25.461]  So, relationship with God, family, friends, storable food, firearms, you know, getting ready, and then silver and gold.
[01:47:25.541 --> 01:47:32.064]  It's just, I only promote stuff, it's, I'm like telling people you better have a bottle of water going into the desert.
[01:47:32.104 --> 01:47:33.244]  This is not rocket science.
[01:47:34.793 --> 01:47:37.055]  Yeah, and you have to get healthy, right?
[01:47:37.075 --> 01:47:39.176]  You don't want to have to go into the doctor and get sick, right?
[01:47:39.216 --> 01:47:47.562]  Which is why everything that you have to offer to people, it's not just financial hope, it's not just political hope, it's health hope, right?
[01:47:47.602 --> 01:47:50.104]  Because we don't want what they've got for us, right?
[01:47:50.124 --> 01:47:52.245]  We have to start taking care of ourselves.
[01:47:52.766 --> 01:47:53.046]  You're right.
[01:47:53.166 --> 01:47:54.427]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, great job.
[01:47:54.587 --> 01:47:55.428]  Thank you so much.
[01:47:55.948 --> 01:47:57.029]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:47:57.049 --> 01:47:57.569]  God bless you.
[01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.650]  Sounds good.
[01:47:58.690 --> 01:47:59.090]  God bless.
[01:47:59.751 --> 01:48:01.632]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:48:02.413 --> 01:48:03.914]  We've seen a lot of people
[01:48:05.854 --> 01:48:14.717]  And a lot of corporate media and a lot of pundits, and I say a lot, thousands of articles, the last month saying, Infowars will imminently be shut down.
[01:48:16.258 --> 01:48:21.460]  And they panicked with a federally appointed CRO and federally appointed U.S.
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:28.142]  trustee from the Justice Department, and five weeks ago, ordered this place shut without a court order.
[01:48:29.417 --> 01:48:33.201]  The judge excoriated them, fired them three weeks ago.
[01:48:33.821 --> 01:48:41.128]  Then two weeks ago, the Democrat Party lawyers that use the Sandy Hook parents as a front group came in and said, we want him shut down today.
[01:48:41.548 --> 01:48:42.789]  The judge shut that down.
[01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:47.073]  Then they tried to grab InfoWars a week and a half ago at the state court.
[01:48:47.153 --> 01:48:48.995]  The judge said that's illegal and shut that down.
[01:48:49.235 --> 01:48:49.856]  This is epic.
[01:48:50.316 --> 01:48:51.718]  People say, how is this continuing on?
[01:48:51.778 --> 01:48:52.678]  Because we're fighting.
[01:48:53.259 --> 01:48:54.140]  We're not giving up.
[01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:54.840]  You're praying.
[01:48:55.541 --> 01:48:59.542]  But I love how five weeks ago I told you this happened and like, oh yeah, they came out in order to shut it down.
[01:49:00.143 --> 01:49:01.903]  You stood up to them and all this, but where's the video?
[01:49:02.103 --> 01:49:04.744]  You want on top of that video confronting people?
[01:49:05.104 --> 01:49:05.925]  This is serious.
[01:49:05.945 --> 01:49:06.885]  I've tried to non-escalate.
[01:49:07.965 --> 01:49:09.086]  Now it's all in the court record.
[01:49:09.326 --> 01:49:10.026]  Of course it's true.
[01:49:10.046 --> 01:49:11.126]  Of course I didn't make this up.
[01:49:11.166 --> 01:49:11.927]  I don't cry wolf.
[01:49:12.967 --> 01:49:19.649]  So, we are surrounded by wolves, but we've got God on our side and we've got the people that love God supporting us.
[01:49:19.709 --> 01:49:24.811]  So, I need all of you to understand that we're still here for at least three months.
[01:49:25.984 --> 01:49:32.027]  But if people think we're not going to be here and don't support InfoWareStore.com with great sales and great products, we'll shut down by extension.
[01:49:32.067 --> 01:49:32.688]  That's been happening.
[01:49:32.948 --> 01:49:33.949]  People aren't buying stuff.
[01:49:34.609 --> 01:49:36.550]  Even though we're selling all the products, it's gone away.
[01:49:36.570 --> 01:49:37.631]  Do they think we're about to be shut down?
[01:49:37.691 --> 01:49:37.811]  No.
[01:49:38.191 --> 01:49:39.352]  You order something, you get it.
[01:49:39.712 --> 01:49:47.016]  And so it'll be you that decides to shut us down if you don't go there and get X2 and X3 and Vitamineral Fusion about to sell it and all of it.
[01:49:47.456 --> 01:49:49.798]  But what I want to talk to you about is a fundraiser.
[01:49:50.498 --> 01:49:58.685]  We have a couple thousand copies of the number one worldwide bestseller, The Great Awakening, The Plan to Defeat the Globalists and Launch the Next Great Renaissance.
[01:49:59.266 --> 01:50:00.547]  Huge thick book I wrote.
[01:50:01.047 --> 01:50:02.429]  Just came out six, eight months ago.
[01:50:02.449 --> 01:50:06.292]  There are a few thousand signed copies left, and it is a fundraiser.
[01:50:06.792 --> 01:50:10.536]  I want to thank those of you that got a signed copy, but I want to encourage all of you
[01:50:12.162 --> 01:50:21.670]  That have not gotten a signed copy and you want a chance to support the broadcast and know that at the critical juncture you fought to get the funds in to keep operating because we're right on the edge of the red and the black.
[01:50:22.791 --> 01:50:29.357]  To go now to infowarsstore.com and get The Great Awakening today.
[01:50:29.417 --> 01:50:33.741]  And there's almost 3,000 copies left of the signed, 1,000 copies unsigned.
[01:50:34.661 --> 01:50:38.645]  There's also about 700 copies of The Great Reset, the predecessor book to this.
[01:50:40.795 --> 01:50:44.277]  And unless we get a buyer and things change and, you know, whatever, we'll be shut down in a few months.
[01:50:44.337 --> 01:50:46.938]  But we will probably continue on.
[01:50:46.998 --> 01:50:48.059]  God's hand is on us.
[01:50:48.099 --> 01:50:48.939]  The force is with us.
[01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:50.980]  Please go now.
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:58.964]  It's in stock, ready to ship at infowarestore.com and get The Great Awakening, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:58.984 --> 01:51:02.106]  Defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[01:51:02.226 --> 01:51:05.628]  And when these signed copies are gone here, they're going to be gone.
[01:51:05.688 --> 01:51:08.029]  I'm going to sign this right now.
[01:51:10.725 --> 01:51:16.351]  2024.
[01:51:10.986 --> 01:51:16.351]  And I thank you for everything you do to support us.
[01:51:16.391 --> 01:51:17.792]  And this will be put in the warehouse.
[01:51:18.193 --> 01:51:20.575]  Somebody will get this book.
[01:51:21.276 --> 01:51:22.477]  Put a little something extra on there.
[01:51:24.719 --> 01:51:24.999]  All right.
[01:51:25.079 --> 01:51:27.222]  So, I appreciate you.
[01:51:27.342 --> 01:51:32.347]  Get The Great Awakening, Defeating the Globalists, and Launching the Next Great Renaissance.
[01:51:33.817 --> 01:51:41.981]  Myself, Alex Jones, Ken Heckenleibig, I'll put it together with a foreword by Stephen K. Bannon, who's a political prisoner right now in Connecticut in jail.
[01:51:42.782 --> 01:51:44.603]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:51:44.623 --> 01:51:45.583]  We're betting on you.
[01:51:45.924 --> 01:51:47.024]  We believe on you.
[01:51:47.364 --> 01:51:49.205]  But we cannot do this without your support.
[01:51:49.625 --> 01:51:50.246]  Get a copy.
[01:51:50.266 --> 01:51:51.446]  Sign or unsign now.
[01:51:51.767 --> 01:51:54.608]  The last copies at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:51:54.628 --> 01:51:56.769]  And I humbly thank you all for your support.
[01:51:56.829 --> 01:51:58.110]  Now, please take action.
[01:52:09.201 --> 01:52:10.422]  It's time to break the conditioning.
[01:52:11.442 --> 01:52:12.463]  It's time to admit where we are.
[01:52:13.664 --> 01:52:18.547]  It's time to wake up and decide whether we're gonna be slaves or roll over to the new order or we're gonna stand up and live.
[01:52:21.308 --> 01:52:21.849]  The Grid.
[01:52:22.829 --> 01:52:24.050]  A digital frontier.
[01:52:25.170 --> 01:52:26.011]  The Grid.
[01:52:31.054 --> 01:52:32.295]  A digital frontier.
[01:52:34.242 --> 01:52:38.605]  I tried to picture clusters of information as they move through the computer.
[01:52:39.406 --> 01:52:40.387]  What do they look like?
[01:52:41.127 --> 01:52:41.467]  Ships?
[01:52:41.627 --> 01:52:42.448]  Motorcycles?
[01:52:44.169 --> 01:52:45.810]  Were the circuits like freeways?
[01:52:48.933 --> 01:52:52.415]  I kept dreaming of the world I thought I'd never see.
[01:52:52.495 --> 01:52:53.556]  And then, one day, I got in.
[01:53:08.281 --> 01:53:12.602]  We are contending, not against flesh and blood, but the princes and powers of the air.
[01:53:13.642 --> 01:53:15.303]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:53:15.323 --> 01:53:16.863]  Very honored and blessed to be here with you.
[01:53:17.423 --> 01:53:18.663]  All right, huge developments.
[01:53:18.703 --> 01:53:23.844]  The official selection and coronation of Kamala Harris, they say, is complete.
[01:53:24.565 --> 01:53:27.365]  They may backstab her tomorrow or assassinate her and blame it on Trump.
[01:53:27.785 --> 01:53:28.625]  That's all on the cards.
[01:53:29.526 --> 01:53:32.426]  And again, I don't know exactly what they're going to do because they don't know what they're going to do.
[01:53:32.746 --> 01:53:33.887]  But I know how to think like them.
[01:53:33.927 --> 01:53:35.387]  That's why we're so accurate.
[01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:39.301]  I told you the day when Biden would step down, I told you they would try to assassinate Trump.
[01:53:40.002 --> 01:53:44.164]  I specifically laid out what they would do because I'm in their head.
[01:53:44.944 --> 01:53:47.685]  Harris wins Democrat nomination, DNC announces.
[01:53:48.366 --> 01:53:49.326]  I'll cover that next segment.
[01:53:49.346 --> 01:53:50.407]  She didn't win anything.
[01:53:51.287 --> 01:53:53.388]  But just think about where they put us, like Maduro.
[01:53:56.289 --> 01:54:00.591]  Dozens of international polling agencies, very respected, went and did exit polls.
[01:54:01.872 --> 01:54:03.813]  All of them found the same number.
[01:54:06.718 --> 01:54:11.139]  Five or six found 63%, a bunch of others found 64%, a bunch of others found 65%.
[01:54:11.439 --> 01:54:14.720]  Between 63% and 65% is what Gonzalez got.
[01:54:16.441 --> 01:54:17.441]  The place is a hellhole.
[01:54:17.461 --> 01:54:19.022]  It used to be richer in the U.S.
[01:54:19.042 --> 01:54:19.722]  until the 90s.
[01:54:21.262 --> 01:54:25.084]  But they got rich, and the communists came in and said, we're going to redistribute it all, and now there's nothing.
[01:54:26.724 --> 01:54:32.266]  Except the IMF and World Bank loans that Maduro and Hugo Chavez before him paid.
[01:54:34.527 --> 01:54:35.507]  So that's what we're covering.
[01:54:36.923 --> 01:54:37.924]  That's what we're breaking down.
[01:54:38.725 --> 01:54:39.445]  We're going to go to break.
[01:54:39.465 --> 01:54:43.089]  Some stations don't carry this show, this first five minutes.
[01:54:43.689 --> 01:54:45.411]  But I'm on, like, extra spaces.
[01:54:45.451 --> 01:54:46.532]  People say, why are there breaks?
[01:54:47.032 --> 01:54:48.774]  Well, I know a lot of you are really young.
[01:54:48.794 --> 01:54:49.614]  I still feel really young.
[01:54:49.655 --> 01:54:49.755]  I'm 50.
[01:54:50.976 --> 01:54:54.058]  We're still on hundreds of radio stations and TV stations, and they have breaks.
[01:54:54.439 --> 01:54:56.080]  We skip all the network breaks now.
[01:54:57.261 --> 01:55:03.167]  Because normally in network, TV, and radio, you get half the breaks as the provider of the show, and they get the other half.
[01:55:04.517 --> 01:55:05.217]  The local stations.
[01:55:05.257 --> 01:55:07.659]  Well, we just run local stations ads, but we've got to run them.
[01:55:07.739 --> 01:55:17.343]  And when they tried to shut us down six years ago, it was the 300 plus radio stations, about 200 now, that kept us on air.
[01:55:19.004 --> 01:55:20.425]  And so we're very thankful for that.
[01:55:20.445 --> 01:55:23.587]  We're very thankful to the listeners and the folks that are tuned in there.
[01:55:23.607 --> 01:55:24.327]  That is so precious.
[01:55:24.487 --> 01:55:27.168]  Every outlet we've got, they can shut down InfoWars tomorrow.
[01:55:27.369 --> 01:55:30.030]  We can still beam up the satellites.
[01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:33.372]  And then you've got to find the local radio stations around the country that are restreaming us.
[01:55:33.392 --> 01:55:33.932]  You can get it there.
[01:55:35.925 --> 01:55:39.167]  Everything I've done is about redundance, knowing these attacks on our speech would come.
[01:55:40.167 --> 01:55:41.988]  And it was the Holy Spirit who laid it on me to do this.
[01:55:42.788 --> 01:55:49.751]  So we spent incredible amounts of money on building infrastructure to be hard to kill.
[01:55:50.812 --> 01:55:52.873]  And because of that, we survived the last six years.
[01:55:52.913 --> 01:55:55.274]  And now we're facing our greatest challenges.
[01:55:55.994 --> 01:55:58.095]  So I thank you for supporting our sponsors and everything we do.
[01:55:58.135 --> 01:55:59.296]  But the most important thing is,
[01:56:00.916 --> 01:56:07.239]  Pray for the broadcast and share the links, the articles, the videos at RealAlexJones and Infowars.com and everywhere else.
[01:56:07.259 --> 01:56:12.502]  Because when you, the millions of listeners, get active and you decide to take action, nothing can stop you.
[01:56:13.102 --> 01:56:14.183]  But I can't make you share a link.
[01:56:14.223 --> 01:56:15.083]  I can't make you pray for us.
[01:56:15.143 --> 01:56:18.325]  I can't make you look at a great supplement that will empower your life or a t-shirt or a book.
[01:56:18.625 --> 01:56:19.165]  That's up to you.
[01:56:19.585 --> 01:56:20.686]  But I ask you to make the right decision.
[01:56:21.306 --> 01:56:24.748]  Back in 60 seconds, I'm going to hit all the big news and then Tommy Robbins will join us.
[01:56:24.768 --> 01:56:25.068]  Stay with us.
[01:56:26.689 --> 01:56:28.350]  We are now into hour number three.
[01:56:29.793 --> 01:56:33.095]  I am your embattled host, fighting to the end, ever defiant.
[01:56:33.575 --> 01:56:34.976]  My North Star is God.
[01:56:55.346 --> 01:56:58.488]  Monday through Friday from 11am to 3pm Central, we are here.
[01:56:59.662 --> 01:57:01.603]  Fighting the globalists at point-blank range.
[01:57:15.651 --> 01:57:20.654]  Winston Churchill, during World War II, famously wrote, I'm paraphrasing him, he wrote the quote.
[01:57:21.234 --> 01:57:22.535]  Type in a Winston Churchill quote.
[01:57:25.977 --> 01:57:27.357]  Get up and brush yourself off.
[01:57:27.457 --> 01:57:27.958]  That should do it.
[01:57:28.826 --> 01:57:40.672]  Winston Churchill said most people get hit by history and they decide to not recognize they're living in history, because history is written later, and they just get up and brush themselves off.
[01:57:40.712 --> 01:57:49.136]  But there is that individual that's hit by history and decides to live in that time they are and actually be someone that affects change, who has an effect.
[01:57:49.496 --> 01:57:50.176]  I'm paraphrasing him.
[01:57:52.617 --> 01:57:57.660]  And that's what this broadcast is all about, is getting you to realize that the war for the future
[01:57:58.689 --> 01:58:05.638]  And everything we stand for and everything humanity's been, that our ancestors fought for, is happening now.
[01:58:07.472 --> 01:58:13.456]  And I simply want you to dial into the majesty and the beauty and the serenity of that.
[01:58:14.157 --> 01:58:20.701]  Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing has happened.
[01:58:21.021 --> 01:58:24.504]  Yeah, guys, you found the quote.
[01:58:24.564 --> 01:58:25.885]  I read five or six of his books.
[01:58:25.925 --> 01:58:31.148]  I read the three-part series, History of the English-Speaking Peoples, when I was a teenager, and then I read a couple of his other books.
[01:58:31.709 --> 01:58:34.451]  So I read that like 35 years ago, so I don't...
[01:58:35.171 --> 01:58:36.392]  You know, I'm just giving you knowledge.
[01:58:36.432 --> 01:58:37.652]  It's like, sapped in.
[01:58:38.192 --> 01:58:47.256]  And I'm not... The full... Full article or full, you know, chapter is about what I just told you.
[01:58:48.877 --> 01:58:50.698]  So, here we are.
[01:58:51.638 --> 01:58:52.499]  And this is epic.
[01:58:53.839 --> 01:58:58.021]  And you can be an NPC, a non-player character, or you can actually be on the real game grid.
[01:58:59.942 --> 01:59:02.023]  And you can defeat the actual central computer.
[01:59:03.553 --> 01:59:07.176]  It's not all powerful because it's only plagiarizing humanity.
[01:59:07.436 --> 01:59:12.461]  The AI is only stealing who we are and showing it back to us and all the models show it's nothing.
[01:59:15.483 --> 01:59:18.126]  Oh, the Secret Service head, the last one resigned.
[01:59:18.146 --> 01:59:19.947]  This is the guy that actually ran the operation against Trump.
[01:59:21.048 --> 01:59:24.511]  He's now in full poop his pants mode.
[01:59:24.731 --> 01:59:26.172]  Oh, we don't know who stood down.
[01:59:26.192 --> 01:59:27.073]  We don't know who gave the order.
[01:59:27.454 --> 01:59:28.895]  Now he plagiarized himself for
[01:59:31.605 --> 01:59:36.287]  He perjured himself to Congress, and now he's giving a press conference.
[01:59:36.307 --> 01:59:36.847]  I know it's live.
[01:59:36.887 --> 01:59:37.807]  Can we back it up a few minutes?
[01:59:40.749 --> 01:59:41.329]  Yeah, back it up.
[01:59:41.469 --> 01:59:41.849]  Back it up.
[01:59:42.850 --> 01:59:45.771]  So, yeah, this is crap your britches time.
[01:59:48.352 --> 01:59:49.633]  Brother, you're going under the jail.
[01:59:52.054 --> 01:59:52.834]  And you know it's true.
[01:59:52.874 --> 01:59:54.995]  They say Trump's going to put people in prison if he gets elected.
[01:59:55.235 --> 01:59:55.656]  He better.
[01:59:56.416 --> 01:59:57.036]  That's his duty.
[01:59:57.076 --> 01:59:58.497]  They committed a bunch of crimes against everybody.
[02:00:00.421 --> 02:00:05.304]  These rat bastards Maduro type people are disgusting.
[02:00:08.365 --> 02:00:09.786]  So let's hear his BS crap.
[02:00:10.907 --> 02:00:13.348]  He is now in full crap his britches mode.
[02:00:13.828 --> 02:00:20.672]  Lied to Congress and says I don't know who ordered the Secret Service to cut down people and it came out in documents he gave the order.
[02:00:22.693 --> 02:00:25.475]  Yeah, let's go ahead and go to a few minutes of this and I got the other breaking news.
[02:00:25.515 --> 02:00:25.755]  Here it is.
[02:00:27.702 --> 02:00:39.050]  I'm focused on ensuring that the full resources of the Secret Service are utilized to safeguard our protectees, and I've implemented and will continue to implement changes to ensure that that happens.
[02:00:51.117 --> 02:01:06.187]  We are, and we will continue to cooperate with pending oversight investigations of the July 13th failure being done now by Congress, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General, and the independent review directed by President Biden.
[02:01:06.367 --> 02:01:15.292]  Additionally, the Secret Service's Office of Professional Responsibility is currently conducting a mission assurance review.
[02:01:16.892 --> 02:01:22.094]  As I stated, I'm not waiting for the completion of those reports.
[02:01:22.334 --> 02:01:26.056]  And I've directed the Secret Service to take immediate steps to ensure our protectees are being safe.
[02:01:26.136 --> 02:01:29.997]  I am committed to pursuing accountability for the Secret Service personnel.
[02:01:30.017 --> 02:01:34.659]  The policy violations by Secret Service personnel are identified by the agency's Mission Assurance Review.
[02:01:47.321 --> 02:01:50.944]  You think those little games you play can fool a Carlioni, buddy?
[02:01:51.124 --> 02:01:51.184]  Ha!
[02:01:51.204 --> 02:01:51.785]  We know it's you!
[02:02:14.693 --> 02:02:16.014]  And I promised accountability.
[02:02:16.455 --> 02:02:16.935]  Oh yeah, right.
[02:02:17.296 --> 02:02:19.638]  And I will not rush to judgment nor ignore due process.
[02:02:19.719 --> 02:02:21.080]  Everything he says is the opposite.
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:25.265]  Every single person within the Secret Service feels the weight of what happened.
[02:02:26.758 --> 02:02:32.882]  We are in an unprecedented threat environment and a high operational tempo during this presidential campaign.
[02:02:34.263 --> 02:02:41.447]  The men and women of the Secret Service are working incredibly hard and doing their jobs under difficult circumstances.
[02:02:41.907 --> 02:02:45.969]  They need to focus on their work and they need to know that I have their backs.
[02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:47.870]  And that is my commitment to them.
[02:02:50.054 --> 02:02:51.814]  I want to thank our state and local partners.
[02:02:52.354 --> 02:02:56.155]  The Secret Service relies on local law enforcement for every protective event.
[02:02:57.015 --> 02:03:01.056]  Those valiant men and women work tirelessly protecting their communities.
[02:03:01.996 --> 02:03:05.317]  They know the people, places, and terrain that we operate in.
[02:03:06.557 --> 02:03:10.718]  We owe them our thanks, and simply put, we cannot do our jobs without them.
[02:03:12.298 --> 02:03:14.659]  And I know how important this relationship is.
[02:03:14.819 --> 02:03:17.379]  The fact that he crawled out from under a rock shows they're in full panic mode.
[02:03:20.376 --> 02:03:25.218]  I know the long hours these men and women put in and the professionalism they bring to this partnership.
[02:03:25.238 --> 02:03:26.478]  He's trying to tie himself to Secret Service now.
[02:03:26.498 --> 02:03:29.479]  And in that capacity... You're a Democrat operative.
[02:03:29.519 --> 02:03:30.780]  You ran the attack.
[02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:32.560]  We know you did it.
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:33.741]  You did it.
[02:03:33.781 --> 02:03:34.661]  You did it.
[02:03:34.681 --> 02:03:35.541]  You're the suspect.
[02:03:36.041 --> 02:03:37.542]  You're the bad guy.
[02:03:37.562 --> 02:03:38.462]  You ordered the stand down.
[02:03:38.522 --> 02:03:38.762]  You.
[02:03:38.822 --> 02:03:39.123]  You.
[02:03:39.183 --> 02:03:39.523]  Ronald Roe.
[02:03:39.543 --> 02:03:39.743]  You.
[02:03:43.504 --> 02:03:43.744]  That's you!
[02:03:43.764 --> 02:03:44.565]  Order the stand down!
[02:03:44.605 --> 02:03:44.765]  You!
[02:03:44.805 --> 02:03:44.865]  You!
[02:03:45.305 --> 02:03:45.446]  You!
[02:03:45.466 --> 02:03:45.526]  You!
[02:03:45.546 --> 02:03:45.706]  You!

[02:03:46.306 --> 02:03:46.366]  You!
[02:03:46.386 --> 02:03:46.446]  You!
[02:03:46.466 --> 02:03:46.546]  You!
[02:03:46.566 --> 02:03:46.626]  You!
[02:03:46.646 --> 02:03:46.727]  You!
[02:03:46.747 --> 02:03:46.827]  You!
[02:03:46.847 --> 02:03:46.987]  You!
[02:03:47.047 --> 02:03:47.127]  You!
[02:03:47.327 --> 02:03:47.527]  You!
[02:03:47.547 --> 02:03:47.607]  You!
[02:03:47.627 --> 02:03:47.767]  You!
[02:03:47.807 --> 02:03:47.887]  You!
[02:03:47.907 --> 02:03:48.028]  You!
[02:03:48.088 --> 02:03:48.168]  You!
[02:03:48.208 --> 02:03:48.288]  You!
[02:03:48.308 --> 02:03:48.368]  You!
[02:03:48.448 --> 02:03:48.508]  You!
[02:03:48.528 --> 02:03:48.588]  You!
[02:03:48.628 --> 02:03:48.688]  You!
[02:03:48.708 --> 02:03:48.828]  You!
[02:03:48.848 --> 02:03:48.908]  You!
[02:03:48.988 --> 02:03:49.108]  You!
[02:03:49.128 --> 02:03:49.208]  You!
[02:03:49.228 --> 02:03:49.309]  You!
[02:03:49.369 --> 02:03:49.429]  You!
[02:03:49.469 --> 02:03:49.589]  You!
[02:03:49.609 --> 02:03:49.749]  You!
[02:03:49.789 --> 02:03:49.869]  You!
[02:03:49.889 --> 02:03:49.969]  You!
[02:03:49.989 --> 02:03:50.089]  You!
[02:03:50.109 --> 02:03:50.249]  You!
[02:03:50.269 --> 02:03:50.369]  You!
[02:03:50.389 --> 02:03:50.509]  You!
[02:03:50.529 --> 02:03:50.610]  You!
[02:03:50.630 --> 02:03:50.690]  You!
[02:03:50.710 --> 02:03:50.770]  You!
[02:03:50.830 --> 02:03:51.070]  You!
[02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:51.230]  You!
[02:03:51.250 --> 02:03:51.310]  You!
[02:03:51.330 --> 02:03:51.390]  You!
[02:03:51.410 --> 02:03:51.550]  You!
[02:03:51.570 --> 02:03:51.770]  You!
[02:03:51.790 --> 02:03:51.870]  You!
[02:03:51.931 --> 02:03:51.991]  You!
[02:03:52.011 --> 02:03:52.071]  You!
[02:03:52.091 --> 02:03:52.251]  You!
[02:03:52.271 --> 02:03:52.371]  You!
[02:03:52.391 --> 02:03:52.451]  You!
[02:03:52.471 --> 02:03:52.531]  You!
[02:03:52.551 --> 02:03:52.811]  You!
[02:03:52.831 --> 02:03:52.971]  You!
[02:03:52.991 --> 02:03:53.091]  You!
[02:03:53.111 --> 02:03:53.272]  You!
[02:03:53.312 --> 02:03:53.472]  You!
[02:03:53.492 --> 02:03:53.652]  You!
[02:03:53.672 --> 02:03:53.752]  You!
[02:03:53.772 --> 02:03:53.852]  You!
[02:03:53.872 --> 02:03:53.932]  You!
[02:03:53.992 --> 02:03:54.072]  You!
[02:03:54.172 --> 02:03:54.292]  You!
[02:03:54.312 --> 02:03:54.452]  You!
[02:03:54.472 --> 02:03:54.613]  You!
[02:03:54.673 --> 02:03:54.753]  You!
[02:03:54.773 --> 02:03:54.833]  You!
[02:03:54.853 --> 02:03:54.913]  You!
[02:03:55.033 --> 02:03:55.213]  You!
[02:03:55.253 --> 02:03:55.313]  You!
[02:03:55.373 --> 02:03:55.573]  You!
[02:03:55.593 --> 02:03:55.713]  You!
[02:03:55.733 --> 02:03:55.793]  You!
[02:03:55.813 --> 02:03:55.874]  You!
[02:03:55.894 --> 02:03:55.954]  You!
[02:03:55.974 --> 02:03:56.034]  You!
[02:03:56.054 --> 02:03:56.114]  You!
[02:03:56.734 --> 02:03:56.894]  You!
[02:03:56.914 --> 02:03:57.014]  You!
[02:03:57.034 --> 02:03:57.094]  You!
[02:03:57.114 --> 02:03:57.175]  You!
[02:03:57.195 --> 02:03:57.255]  You!
[02:03:57.315 --> 02:03:57.415]  You!
[02:03:57.435 --> 02:03:57.495]  You!
[02:03:57.515 --> 02:03:57.615]  You!
[02:03:57.635 --> 02:03:57.795]  You!
[02:03:57.815 --> 02:03:57.915]  You!
[02:03:57.955 --> 02:03:58.035]  You!
[02:03:58.055 --> 02:03:58.115]  You!
[02:03:58.155 --> 02:03:58.315]  You!
[02:03:58.375 --> 02:03:58.496]  You!
[02:03:58.536 --> 02:03:58.636]  You!
[02:03:58.756 --> 02:03:58.876]  You!
[02:03:58.896 --> 02:03:59.036]  You!
[02:03:59.076 --> 02:03:59.156]  You!
[02:03:59.176 --> 02:03:59.276]  You!
[02:03:59.296 --> 02:03:59.416]  You!
[02:03:59.436 --> 02:03:59.536]  You!
[02:03:59.596 --> 02:03:59.696]  You!
[02:03:59.716 --> 02:03:59.777]  You!
[02:03:59.817 --> 02:04:00.057]  You!
[02:04:00.237 --> 02:04:00.337]  You!
[02:04:00.357 --> 02:04:00.417]  You
[02:04:11.758 --> 02:04:15.521]  But I can say without a doubt that heroism was present that day.
[02:04:16.442 --> 02:04:26.310]  Secret Service agents rushed to the stage to shield the former president with their bodies within three seconds of bullets ringing out in an unflinching act of bravery.
[02:04:27.070 --> 02:04:33.495]  The Secret Service counter-sniper who neutralized the threat with a single shot undoubtedly saved countless lives.
[02:04:33.535 --> 02:04:35.637]  Despite you not putting a command and control system in place.
[02:04:35.657 --> 02:04:36.978]  We're at a high operational tempo.
[02:04:38.439 --> 02:04:39.060]  And I need
[02:04:40.063 --> 02:04:51.487]  And I want our Secret Service workforce, the dedicated men and women of the Secret Service, I want to know and I want to make sure that they are uplifted so they can focus on carrying out the mission.
[02:04:51.507 --> 02:04:52.667]  Yeah, stop attacking me.
[02:04:52.687 --> 02:04:55.888]  I'm going to follow the Secret Service and make it about them.
[02:04:56.968 --> 02:04:57.889]  Disgusting blob.
[02:04:58.129 --> 02:05:02.370]  And let me take a moment to speak to the American people that are counting on us.
[02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:03.870]  We know you did it.
[02:05:04.050 --> 02:05:06.811]  We know you're scared and you should be, pal.
[02:05:07.351 --> 02:05:08.032]  You little criminal.
[02:05:09.557 --> 02:05:10.337]  He ran the attack.
[02:05:11.118 --> 02:05:12.018]  He ran the attack.
[02:05:12.038 --> 02:05:13.478]  He ran the attack.
[02:05:13.899 --> 02:05:14.939]  He ran the attack.
[02:05:15.319 --> 02:05:16.279]  He ran the attack.
[02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:17.480]  He's behind it.
[02:05:17.860 --> 02:05:18.700]  He met with Mayorkas.
[02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:19.601]  They planned it all out.
[02:05:19.661 --> 02:05:20.641]  It's all going to come out.
[02:05:20.661 --> 02:05:22.081]  There's a sack of shit like you.
[02:05:22.242 --> 02:05:24.142]  He's so pissed that he killed Trump.
[02:05:24.162 --> 02:05:24.982]  Yeah, you missed, you little bastard.
[02:05:35.762 --> 02:05:56.049]  They are standing the watch, providing a blanket of protection to the people that work in the White House, to the thousands of people who attend political rallies and nominating conventions, to the thousands of American citizens who line Pennsylvania Avenue every four years on an inauguration date to see the new president and the new vice president.
[02:05:57.009 --> 02:06:00.430]  And they are out there right now doing this.
[02:06:00.670 --> 02:06:05.572]  They are focused and they live their professional lives committed to the values of this agency.
[02:06:05.612 --> 02:06:06.592]  It isn't about them.
[02:06:06.612 --> 02:06:08.833]  You are in charge in order to stand out.
[02:06:08.873 --> 02:06:12.013]  He's making it all about the Secret Service, falling back on them.
[02:06:12.454 --> 02:06:13.394]  You're disgusting.
[02:06:13.414 --> 02:06:15.234]  And this is what we do.
[02:06:16.135 --> 02:06:18.315]  And we will earn back your trust.
[02:06:19.836 --> 02:06:23.597]  I'll now provide a timeline of the visit to Butler, Pennsylvania.
[02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:36.942]  On July 8th, personnel assigned to the agency's Pittsburgh field office conducted planning meetings and a site walk-through with law enforcement partners and campaign staff.
[02:06:36.962 --> 02:06:38.243]  As we warmed up the shooter at a hotel.
[02:06:38.643 --> 02:06:46.525]  On July 10th, Secret Service counter-sniper and technical security personnel arrived in Pittsburgh and began advanced planning for their teams.
[02:06:47.845 --> 02:06:54.167]  July 12th, the build-out of the campaign rally site began and continued through the early morning hours of July 13th.
[02:06:56.807 --> 02:07:00.529]  So none of this is about how he cut the main force and lied about it to Congress.
[02:07:00.609 --> 02:07:04.411]  Hit pause.
[02:07:05.351 --> 02:07:07.432]  Why didn't this happen the day of, the day after?
[02:07:07.472 --> 02:07:07.992]  You know what I mean?
[02:07:08.012 --> 02:07:08.452]  You get that.
[02:07:08.472 --> 02:07:09.573]  Because they didn't want a timeline.
[02:07:10.253 --> 02:07:15.175]  And now he's giving you some type of timeline because he's scared because they thought, we'll just cover it up and not respond.
[02:07:15.655 --> 02:07:16.336]  Ignore it happened.
[02:07:16.516 --> 02:07:18.717]  Remember the media was like, oh Trump didn't get shot the first day.
[02:07:18.737 --> 02:07:19.077]  Remember that?
[02:07:21.505 --> 02:07:23.566]  And so now he's trying to bring you some timeline.
[02:07:23.907 --> 02:07:24.827]  Oh, it's investigated.
[02:07:24.847 --> 02:07:25.287]  Let's move along.
[02:07:25.608 --> 02:07:26.888]  You ordered a stand down.
[02:07:27.169 --> 02:07:28.049]  You lied to Congress.
[02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:28.449]  You did it.
[02:07:28.529 --> 02:07:29.330]  You're done.
[02:07:30.050 --> 02:07:30.871]  We caught you.
[02:07:30.891 --> 02:07:33.853]  Continue with this sack of filth.
[02:07:34.273 --> 02:07:39.356]  Commenced prior to the site's opening to event staff, vendors and to the public.
[02:07:40.877 --> 02:07:44.920]  At 1230 p.m., the Secret Service opened the protective site to event staff and vendors.
[02:07:45.745 --> 02:07:51.569]  And then at 1 o'clock, magnetometer screening of the estimated 15,000 people attending the campaign rally.
[02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:52.990]  No one on the roof.
[02:07:53.250 --> 02:07:55.251]  He ran around for 90 minutes.
[02:07:55.271 --> 02:07:56.072]  26 minutes on the roof.
[02:07:56.172 --> 02:08:01.175]  At 5.30 p.m., former President Trump arrived at the campaign rally via Secret Service motorcade.
[02:08:01.195 --> 02:08:04.177]  Notice they didn't cover any of his rallies last year, but they did cover this one.
[02:08:04.598 --> 02:08:06.879]  Backstage area within the protective site.
[02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:08.580]  They wanted his head getting blown off.
[02:08:10.097 --> 02:08:11.118]  When did you meet with Mayorkas?
[02:08:11.138 --> 02:08:12.638]  When did he give you the stand down order?
[02:08:12.738 --> 02:08:14.799]  Now notice the last lady was a puppet.
[02:08:14.819 --> 02:08:15.480]  She didn't do all this.
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:15.820]  He's the guy.
[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:16.941]  He's the one running all this.
[02:08:16.961 --> 02:08:17.581]  He's the guy.
[02:08:17.601 --> 02:08:17.881]  He's the guy.
[02:08:17.901 --> 02:08:18.381]  Now he's scared.
[02:08:18.441 --> 02:08:20.462]  His bosses are like, go out there and flimflam him.
[02:08:38.635 --> 02:08:46.745]  At this time, Secret Service personnel were operating with the knowledge that local law enforcement was working on an issue of a suspicious individual.
[02:08:48.030 --> 02:08:52.611]  The concept of local law enforcement working on such issues is common at sites.
[02:08:53.411 --> 02:08:57.272]  And on July 13th, there were over a hundred calls for support.
[02:08:57.512 --> 02:09:01.654]  Yeah, they were working on it and asking you to stop him, but you didn't.
[02:09:01.914 --> 02:09:04.554]  And the Secret Service said, don't worry about it, the cops are on video.
[02:09:04.934 --> 02:09:14.777]  Neither the Secret Service counter-sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the AGR building with a firearm.
[02:09:15.925 --> 02:09:21.410]  It is my understanding that personnel were not aware they still had a firearm until they heard gunshots.
[02:09:22.992 --> 02:09:35.844]  At 6.11pm, a member of the former president, Trump's protective detail, contacted their Pittsburgh field office counterpart to inquire about the radio update that there was an issue local law enforcement was looking into near the perimeter.
[02:09:35.885 --> 02:09:40.149]  So they got a big problem 15-20 minutes before Trump gets shot.
[02:09:41.448 --> 02:09:45.309]  The cops are coming to call the Secret Service line and say, hey, there's a dude on the roof.
[02:09:45.929 --> 02:09:47.010]  He's trying to spin this.
[02:09:47.070 --> 02:09:47.590]  He knows.
[02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:50.091]  He screwed the pooch, buddy pal.
[02:09:50.791 --> 02:09:51.591]  We know you did it.
[02:09:52.491 --> 02:09:53.392]  We know you planned it.
[02:09:53.432 --> 02:09:54.192]  You're guilty.
[02:09:54.652 --> 02:09:55.272]  You did it.
[02:09:55.712 --> 02:09:56.713]  We know you did.
[02:09:58.793 --> 02:10:00.114]  Stick a fork in your ass.
[02:10:00.574 --> 02:10:00.994]  Continue.
[02:10:02.887 --> 02:10:06.209]  6.11pm, the assailant's first volley of three shots was fired.
[02:10:06.769 --> 02:10:14.293]  And within three seconds, the former president's detail rushed the stage and covered former President Trump, shielding him with their own bodies.
[02:10:14.313 --> 02:10:16.054]  Yeah, don't hide behind the Secret Service at their job.
[02:10:16.234 --> 02:10:18.975]  The four through eight shots... You ordered the stand-down, jackass!
[02:10:19.816 --> 02:10:27.820]  Fifteen and a half seconds after the assailant's first shot, a Secret Service counter-sniper fired a single round that neutralized the assailant.
[02:10:29.975 --> 02:10:33.630]  That concludes a quick brief summary of the timeline.
[02:10:35.083 --> 02:10:38.045]  And with that, I'll turn it over to our staff here.
[02:10:38.065 --> 02:10:40.727]  So they thought they'd just stay quiet and this would all blow over.
[02:10:40.747 --> 02:10:41.808]  It ain't blowing over, buddy.
[02:10:42.468 --> 02:10:44.310]  You're going to prison, Roe.
[02:10:45.471 --> 02:10:46.251]  We know you did it.
[02:10:46.271 --> 02:10:48.573]  That's the guilty right there.
[02:10:48.833 --> 02:10:49.573]  He coordinated it.
[02:10:49.594 --> 02:10:50.314]  That him right there.
[02:10:50.374 --> 02:10:50.734]  That's him.
[02:11:01.542 --> 02:11:03.223]  He can't do discipline!
[02:11:03.283 --> 02:11:04.884]  He ran and it's come out!
[02:11:06.245 --> 02:11:07.926]  He's hiding behind the Secret Service!
[02:11:08.226 --> 02:11:08.786]  He did it!
[02:11:09.107 --> 02:11:09.887]  He's guilty!
[02:11:10.167 --> 02:11:10.908]  He's the man!
[02:11:11.188 --> 02:11:11.748]  Right there!
[02:11:11.968 --> 02:11:12.649]  The stand down!
[02:11:12.849 --> 02:11:13.549]  The inside job!
[02:11:13.769 --> 02:11:14.410]  There he is!
[02:11:14.650 --> 02:11:15.190]  There he is!
[02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.951]  Go back to him!
[02:11:17.472 --> 02:11:20.153]  With or without pay, has anyone been fired?
[02:11:20.593 --> 02:11:26.295]  And will you tell us, as people are disciplined along the way, or is this something we're going to need to just constantly be asking?
[02:11:26.315 --> 02:11:26.535]  He can't!
[02:11:26.555 --> 02:11:27.056]  He did it!
[02:11:27.436 --> 02:11:29.136]  Or will you update and tell us?
[02:11:29.357 --> 02:11:31.137]  They're asking the guy who's guilty!
[02:11:31.257 --> 02:11:32.718]  Six people, seven people.
[02:11:33.318 --> 02:11:33.898]  What can you tell us?
[02:11:33.918 --> 02:11:34.358]  Hit pause.
[02:11:34.579 --> 02:11:37.320]  It's like saying to Hitler, who are you going to punish for the Nazis?
[02:11:42.442 --> 02:11:45.943]  He's like Herman Goering to Mayorkas, who's Hitler.
[02:11:49.212 --> 02:11:50.273]  Who are you gonna punish?
[02:11:50.533 --> 02:11:51.213]  He did it!
[02:11:51.453 --> 02:11:52.154]  It's come out!
[02:11:52.394 --> 02:11:53.214]  The whistleblowers!
[02:11:53.594 --> 02:11:54.415]  It's in the Senate!
[02:11:54.655 --> 02:11:55.435]  He ordered it!
[02:11:55.515 --> 02:11:56.136]  He did!
[02:11:56.196 --> 02:11:56.756]  He did!
[02:11:56.796 --> 02:11:57.336]  He did!
[02:11:57.717 --> 02:12:00.198]  And the media's like, who are you gonna punish?
[02:12:02.679 --> 02:12:03.239]  Go back to it.
[02:12:04.420 --> 02:12:09.843]  As I said in my opening statement, there are going to be, uh, there's the Mission Assurance Review.
[02:12:11.227 --> 02:12:29.827]  If that mission assurance review is looking into if there were policy violations at that point If in fact there were policy violations at that point now it'll go into a parallel path of a disciplinary type of investigation those are internal
[02:12:31.802 --> 02:12:40.566]  Um, investigations that deal with employee matters, so we're not going to be able to provide real-time updates or continuously to provide you updates on that.
[02:12:40.986 --> 02:12:50.551]  But what I will tell you is that these are very thorough investigations, and if in fact there were policy violations and they are substantiated, those employees will be held accountable.
[02:12:50.651 --> 02:12:51.351]  You'll be held accountable?
[02:12:53.052 --> 02:12:53.472]  Pause again.
[02:12:54.092 --> 02:12:55.334]  So this is all hiding in plain view.
[02:12:55.354 --> 02:12:57.917]  The guy that masterminded it ordered the stand down.
[02:12:58.358 --> 02:13:02.442]  Incredible record stand down with the idiot up there for 26 minutes, 90 minutes wandering around.
[02:13:02.863 --> 02:13:04.785]  He's now saying he'll punish whoever did it.
[02:13:05.146 --> 02:13:06.087]  He is guilty.
[02:13:08.089 --> 02:13:08.890]  But here's the good news.
[02:13:09.190 --> 02:13:10.912]  They thought they took some of the rug 20 days ago.
[02:13:11.273 --> 02:13:12.094]  It's only gotten bigger.
[02:13:13.275 --> 02:13:13.435]  See?
[02:13:14.502 --> 02:13:17.006]  Because the Senators and others are exposing it, and you are.
[02:13:17.467 --> 02:13:20.592]  Like I told you two weeks ago, three weeks, 20 days ago.
[02:13:21.253 --> 02:13:22.716]  This is the big enchilada, folks.
[02:13:22.756 --> 02:13:23.978]  Good job, everybody, getting this out.
[02:13:24.793 --> 02:13:26.774]  Because this guy, this guy's on the ropes.
[02:13:27.534 --> 02:13:28.974]  We don't wish any harm against him.
[02:13:29.014 --> 02:13:31.315]  They could kill him and say a patriot did it.
[02:13:31.375 --> 02:13:35.296]  You know, like this guy, ooh, he's, we're not gonna hurt him.
[02:13:35.876 --> 02:13:40.698]  But oh, I know the guilty one when I see him.
[02:13:41.238 --> 02:13:42.999]  Like I said, that woman was just a front guy.
[02:13:43.019 --> 02:13:47.500]  I said, whoever her adjunct is, who gave the orders to stand down, I said that 20 days ago.
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:49.041]  And there he is.
[02:13:49.561 --> 02:13:50.421]  There it sits.
[02:13:51.221 --> 02:13:52.682]  There it sits right there.
[02:13:53.242 --> 02:13:53.662]  Continue.
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:57.001]  Oh, he's scared.
[02:13:57.021 --> 02:13:57.822]  He should be, buddy.
[02:13:57.862 --> 02:13:58.202]  Real scared.
[02:13:58.262 --> 02:13:58.803]  A sack of filth.
[02:13:58.843 --> 02:14:01.566]  High-level, you ordered it, you filth, you rat.
[02:14:01.626 --> 02:14:02.407]  Yeah, you're held accountable.
[02:14:22.633 --> 02:14:25.975]  Fair minimum, he was told to stand down.
[02:14:26.015 --> 02:14:30.176]  Roll the whistle now, Roe.
[02:14:30.457 --> 02:14:34.938]  It even just affirms to me that this was a failure.
[02:14:35.159 --> 02:14:37.119]  We should have had better protection.
[02:14:37.139 --> 02:14:37.680]  No, it wasn't.
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:39.901]  It was a failure in killing Trump.
[02:14:41.141 --> 02:14:42.382]  But you didn't fail in your attempt.
[02:14:42.802 --> 02:14:44.042]  Let's get that straight, Jack.
[02:14:44.663 --> 02:14:45.083]  Back to him.
[02:14:46.642 --> 02:14:48.383]  We should have had better coverage on that roof line.
[02:14:49.343 --> 02:14:54.625]  We should have had at least some other set of eyes from the Secret Service point of view covering that.
[02:14:54.765 --> 02:14:57.126]  That building was very close to that outer perimeter.
[02:14:57.946 --> 02:14:59.526]  And we should have had more of a presence.
[02:15:00.607 --> 02:15:08.969]  And so as far as the timeline of him running back and forth, I know the FBI has provided a bit of a chronology as well.
[02:15:09.890 --> 02:15:12.030]  And so I'd have to go back and look at that.
[02:15:12.650 --> 02:15:13.791]  But the bottom line is this, David.
[02:15:14.631 --> 02:15:15.833]  This was a Secret Service failure.
[02:15:16.515 --> 02:15:18.218]  That roof line should have been covered.
[02:15:18.599 --> 02:15:19.961]  We should have had better eyes on that.
[02:15:27.032 --> 02:15:48.166]  I have just a quick follow-up can you describe you said there were a hundred calls for support what kind of who those calls came from and what those look like and also moving forward do you anticipate it if so what any different changes in protocol between how Secret Service communicates or works with local law enforcement?
[02:15:49.768 --> 02:15:52.169]  All the defaults were turned off.
[02:15:52.309 --> 02:15:53.510]  It was a stand-down.
[02:15:53.911 --> 02:15:55.332]  It was an inside job.
[02:15:55.652 --> 02:15:56.613]  He gave the orders.
[02:15:56.873 --> 02:15:58.634]  He just perjured himself to Congress.
[02:15:58.974 --> 02:16:00.175]  Now he's trying to get ahead of it.
[02:16:00.215 --> 02:16:02.097]  You don't just have the stand-down.
[02:16:02.137 --> 02:16:03.057]  You have the cover-up.
[02:16:03.498 --> 02:16:04.138]  And the motive.
[02:16:04.358 --> 02:16:05.539]  And them saying they're gonna kill Trump.
[02:16:05.819 --> 02:16:07.281]  And him being a Democrat Party operative.
[02:16:07.301 --> 02:16:07.801]  My God!
[02:16:10.123 --> 02:16:10.503]  Continue.
[02:16:12.686 --> 02:16:14.427]  Yeah, thank you for that question.
[02:16:14.467 --> 02:16:19.150]  So with regards to calls for support, it was a very hot day that day.
[02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:30.877]  There was a lot of not only EMS type of calls to address people, but you know, there were people that needed some other type of law enforcement assistance.
[02:16:31.697 --> 02:16:32.218]  This happens
[02:16:33.311 --> 02:16:36.472]  Candidly, it happens a lot at outdoor rallies, especially on hot days.
[02:16:37.393 --> 02:16:45.576]  So there was a lot of traffic, radio traffic, on the local net about, hey, I need EMT here.
[02:16:46.216 --> 02:16:49.958]  So there was a lot of people that were needing assistance.
[02:16:50.398 --> 02:16:54.060]  With respect to the interoperability... By the way, that's not a Secret Service job!
[02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:54.720]  More lies!
[02:16:55.100 --> 02:16:55.800]  I'll stop here.
[02:16:55.880 --> 02:16:57.281]  They're going to try again.
[02:16:57.361 --> 02:16:58.662]  It's all they can do.
[02:17:15.052 --> 02:17:16.193]  And Trump needs to just come out.
[02:17:16.213 --> 02:17:17.554]  This guy ordered to stand down.
[02:17:17.594 --> 02:17:18.475]  He lied to Congress.
[02:17:19.216 --> 02:17:20.977]  And they control the Justice Department so he thinks he's safe.
[02:17:20.997 --> 02:17:22.098]  But why is he so scared?
[02:17:22.478 --> 02:17:24.880]  Because the public opinion is totally against him.
[02:17:25.161 --> 02:17:28.403]  And now they can't kill Trump because they know they'll get the blame.
[02:17:28.443 --> 02:17:31.226]  Which is what I told you 20 days ago is key, key, key.
[02:17:31.546 --> 02:17:33.067]  Key, key, key, key, key, key.
[02:17:33.107 --> 02:17:35.689]  Key, key, key, key, key, key, key, key.
[02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:36.931]  Key, key, key.
[02:17:36.991 --> 02:17:38.992]  Key, key, key, key, key.
[02:17:39.032 --> 02:17:39.953]  Key, key, key.
[02:17:40.013 --> 02:17:41.735]  Key, key, key, key, key.
[02:17:42.375 --> 02:17:46.036]  Trump has to come out and expose them key, key, key.
[02:17:46.937 --> 02:17:47.317]  Dammit!
[02:17:47.557 --> 02:17:49.758]  You think I'm risking my life to lose this son of a bitch?
[02:17:50.258 --> 02:17:51.419]  I got these people's name.
[02:17:51.659 --> 02:17:52.379]  I got their number.
[02:17:52.599 --> 02:17:53.720]  I've got their ass!
[02:17:55.920 --> 02:18:03.904]  And we can all stand up and be men and say, I don't know how this is all going to end, but if you guys want to fight, you better believe you got one!
[02:18:04.724 --> 02:18:09.466]  How about fighting Tommy Robbins and arresting for terrorism for having a peaceful demonstration in England?
[02:18:10.620 --> 02:18:12.122]  It's all coming up today!
[02:18:12.882 --> 02:18:15.024]  But the enemy's on the run, ladies and gentlemen!
[02:18:15.385 --> 02:18:16.726]  Humanity has awakened!
[02:18:17.707 --> 02:18:20.590]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with Tommy Robinson, straight ahead!
[02:18:22.148 --> 02:18:33.873]  Whether it's the World Economic Forum, whether it's the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, whether it's Open Philanthropy and Dustin Moskowitz, we know that all of these organizations thought that they could bamboozle all of us.
[02:18:34.294 --> 02:18:39.036]  They thought that by putting fact checkers on every post, we'd stop sharing posts.
[02:18:39.496 --> 02:18:43.398]  They thought by canceling people, that we wouldn't actually listen to people's voices.
[02:18:43.518 --> 02:18:45.099]  But the bad news is for them,
[02:18:45.859 --> 02:18:46.980]  We continue to do it.
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:49.181]  So what are the simple things that you can do?
[02:18:49.542 --> 02:18:55.566]  The simple things you can do, like I said before, support the alternative platforms that are allowing these voices to be heard.
[02:18:55.886 --> 02:18:58.348]  Make sure that you actually have these conversations.
[02:18:58.508 --> 02:19:03.372]  Without the utility of this voice and this platform, we will lose the war.
[02:19:03.792 --> 02:19:05.153]  So our job is really simple.
[02:19:05.593 --> 02:19:06.114]  Share this.
[02:19:06.194 --> 02:19:06.954]  Communicate this.
[02:19:07.014 --> 02:19:08.776]  Support the InfoWar.
[02:19:09.196 --> 02:19:14.681]  Go to InfoWarStore.com for products to keep strong and prepared.
[02:19:14.961 --> 02:19:19.145]  Donate and share the videos at Band.Video.
[02:19:21.246 --> 02:19:33.517]  Right when you think the New World Order has been defeated, it strikes back.
[02:19:38.133 --> 02:19:48.657]  Your emotions are now yours.
[02:19:49.577 --> 02:19:54.039]  Take them.
[02:19:54.059 --> 02:19:54.559]  Sark.
[02:19:54.879 --> 02:19:57.980]  Your user can't help you now, my little program.
[02:20:06.676 --> 02:20:07.077]  I got it.
[02:20:07.538 --> 02:20:08.520]  Steer us over by the beam.
[02:20:09.982 --> 02:20:11.225]  Right next to me.
[02:20:11.305 --> 02:20:12.207]  What could all that do?
[02:20:13.629 --> 02:20:14.491]  I'm gonna jump.
[02:20:16.154 --> 02:20:17.036]  Don't worry.
[02:20:48.650 --> 02:20:49.812]  Friday, August 2nd, 2024.
[02:20:49.872 --> 02:20:52.035]  The world is awakening.
[02:20:52.696 --> 02:20:54.299]  The globalists are in full panic mode.
[02:20:54.920 --> 02:20:57.263]  These are the times that try men and women's souls.
[02:20:58.164 --> 02:21:03.172]  Tommy Robbins has had a hundred thousand people in London protest peacefully against the takeover.
[02:21:08.503 --> 02:21:09.804]  A digital frontier.
[02:21:10.544 --> 02:21:15.989]  I tried to picture clusters of information as they move through the computer.
[02:21:16.870 --> 02:21:17.970]  What do they look like?
[02:21:18.571 --> 02:21:18.931]  Ships?
[02:21:19.091 --> 02:21:19.912]  Motorcycles?
[02:21:20.793 --> 02:21:23.295]  Were the circuits like freeways?
[02:21:25.256 --> 02:21:29.880]  I kept dreaming of the world I thought I'd never see.
[02:21:29.940 --> 02:21:31.201]  And then, one day, I got in.
[02:21:44.562 --> 02:21:47.363]  Unite the Kingdom rally two days ago.
[02:21:47.383 --> 02:21:49.544]  100,000 people in London.
[02:21:49.584 --> 02:21:54.625]  Demonstrations all over the country against the tyranny of the Great Replacement.
[02:21:54.665 --> 02:21:58.786]  And Tommy Robinson arrested in prison many times for free speech.
[02:21:58.966 --> 02:22:05.889]  Brutally arrested again, but out of prison now and exiled from the UK.
[02:22:06.749 --> 02:22:12.231]  Let's show some of the video footage here of the Unite the Kingdom rally and Tommy being arrested.
[02:22:12.531 --> 02:22:13.491]  Roll it with audio right now.
[02:22:19.417 --> 02:22:21.559]  So we're going to play more of this coming up in a moment.
[02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:23.841]  Tommy, so historic.
[02:22:24.342 --> 02:22:25.563]  The system is so scared.
[02:22:25.623 --> 02:22:27.885]  Tell us about this rally and what happened.
[02:22:27.925 --> 02:22:28.926]  It's good to see your face again.
[02:22:28.946 --> 02:22:31.248]  Yeah, it's good to see you Alex, man.
[02:22:31.309 --> 02:22:32.049]  It's good to see you.
[02:22:32.189 --> 02:22:36.133]  So the first one we held was on the 1st of June and on the 1st of June we had 30,000 people.
[02:22:37.463 --> 02:22:53.594]  Well, we protested and raised our voices against population replacement, against the forced migration of undocumented Muslim men into hotels across our country, who from those hotels have committed murder, rape,
[02:22:54.074 --> 02:22:57.635]  Jihad, terrorism, whilst being in the hotel.
[02:22:57.735 --> 02:23:00.036]  So that was on the first.
[02:23:00.056 --> 02:23:17.920]  And then we've done another one on the 27th of July called Unite the Kingdom, which was to unify the entire British population on the streets against mass uncontrolled immigration and to give us back our identity as British people, to celebrate our culture and our identity, which is also being taken from us.
[02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:21.022]  We feel like aliens in our own towns and cities.
[02:23:21.283 --> 02:23:24.825]  We feel like our culture is disappearing and our country is under attack.
[02:23:25.106 --> 02:23:28.128]  And whilst we do that, the government tell us to celebrate it.
[02:23:28.488 --> 02:23:34.213]  Well, we're fed up of celebrating that and celebrating diversity and celebrating LGBTQ+.
[02:23:34.453 --> 02:23:40.318]  We want to celebrate our identity and our fighting spirit as British people to resist tyranny.
[02:23:40.538 --> 02:23:42.339]  And that's what we come out on the 27th to do.
[02:23:42.660 --> 02:23:43.801]  It was the biggest gathering.
[02:23:44.201 --> 02:23:46.603]  It was the largest gathering of patriots London's ever seen.
[02:23:47.043 --> 02:23:48.164]  And you know what's upset them?
[02:23:48.584 --> 02:23:50.245]  It was totally peaceful.
[02:23:50.746 --> 02:23:51.907]  It was totally peaceful.
[02:23:51.967 --> 02:23:55.689]  We set up, we literally had a festival in Trafalgar Square.
[02:23:55.709 --> 02:23:56.470]  It's never been done.
[02:23:57.551 --> 02:23:58.811]  People have never come out like this.
[02:23:58.931 --> 02:24:02.174]  Alex, I've been in this activism for 15 years.
[02:24:02.194 --> 02:24:06.497]  So whilst people feel that our country's in a very, very dark place,
[02:24:07.117 --> 02:24:10.042]  I've never felt the enthusiasm that I feel now.
[02:24:10.542 --> 02:24:14.368]  Everywhere I go, people who hated me are now supporters.
[02:24:14.648 --> 02:24:16.350]  People who realise they've been lied to.
[02:24:16.411 --> 02:24:17.712]  The trust in the media is gone.
[02:24:18.013 --> 02:24:22.880]  The monopoly and the power that they had to deceive the public about us has gone.
[02:24:23.721 --> 02:24:26.603]  It's gone, partly thanks to Elon Musk.
[02:24:26.944 --> 02:24:38.855]  Elon Musk has opened us back up, gave a voice for reality, a voice for the truth, gave us back a platform where people can share the outrageous decisions the police are making, share the horrific
[02:24:39.455 --> 02:24:42.800]  Terrible stories of what's happening in towns and cities across the country.
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:47.867]  And in the last few months, I'd say you've seen the brewing of a mini-revolution in Great Britain.
[02:24:48.307 --> 02:24:51.071]  Since Saturday, there's now been protests.
[02:24:51.131 --> 02:24:52.894]  Unfortunately, not led by us.
[02:24:53.214 --> 02:24:54.476]  They're like rudderless ships.
[02:24:54.836 --> 02:24:57.338]  And there's been violence in many cities across the country.
[02:24:57.358 --> 02:25:10.510]  Well, that's because there's been so many racially targeted attacks on white people, and the Prime Minister calls Brits protesting murder of three young girls by an illegal alien man a promise to keep the Muslim community safe.
[02:25:10.951 --> 02:25:14.334]  I mean, the system's really asking for it.
[02:25:16.693 --> 02:25:27.359]  Well this has really lit people up, it's a, and you have to picture it, so seven year old girls who are at a Taylor Swift dance class, just a class full of young, innocent, beautiful children,
[02:25:28.181 --> 02:25:43.088]  Doing what makes them happy, and a young man who the police have hid most information about, went in there and stabbed well over a dozen of them, murdered three, held their hair whilst he was stabbing them in the face, butchered children.
[02:25:43.528 --> 02:25:45.249]  He butchered young children.
[02:25:45.509 --> 02:25:47.750]  And like everything, Alex, the problem we now have
[02:25:48.530 --> 02:25:51.832]  We don't trust what the media or the police or the government say.
[02:25:52.132 --> 02:25:56.734]  When they come out straight after this, they say they were managing the situation, i.e.
[02:25:56.814 --> 02:25:58.135]  probably lying to us.
[02:25:58.455 --> 02:25:59.175]  And I say that.
[02:25:59.215 --> 02:26:01.577]  People say, well, how can you say that?
[02:26:01.677 --> 02:26:03.738]  In 2016, Alex, I can go through multiple cases.
[02:26:04.158 --> 02:26:07.860]  In 2016, a Somali migrant went to his mosque.
[02:26:08.140 --> 02:26:11.322]  When he went to his mosque, he said he wanted to kill non-Muslims.
[02:26:11.682 --> 02:26:13.163]  So what did the imam and the mosque do?
[02:26:13.383 --> 02:26:14.443]  They didn't contact the police.
[02:26:14.883 --> 02:26:15.884]  They prayed for him.
[02:26:16.444 --> 02:26:21.008]  He then left the mosque, he went into Russell Square in the central London, and he stabbed seven people.
[02:26:21.108 --> 02:26:24.031]  One of the people he murdered was an American citizen.
[02:26:24.751 --> 02:26:28.254]  Whilst he was stabbing them, he was screaming Allah Akbar.
[02:26:28.875 --> 02:26:30.996]  And notice they only release a photo of him as a child.
[02:26:34.836 --> 02:26:35.657]  In this one, yeah.
[02:26:36.077 --> 02:26:41.420]  But in that case in 2016, the media and the government and the police told us it was mental health.
[02:26:41.881 --> 02:26:44.022]  I know for a fact he was screaming Allah Akbar.
[02:26:44.262 --> 02:26:47.084]  We know it was a jihad attack, but they hid it from us.
[02:26:47.804 --> 02:26:53.648]  And my latest film on this shows the lengths they go to to lie, to deceive the British public.
[02:26:53.968 --> 02:26:57.051]  Now if they're concerned, that's why we can't trust a word they're saying.
[02:26:57.291 --> 02:27:01.855]  And when they do show a picture of him, he looks like an innocent little 8 or 9, 10 year old boy.
[02:27:02.256 --> 02:27:03.697]  Why don't you show us his mugshot?
[02:27:03.937 --> 02:27:05.379]  Why don't you show us recent pictures?
[02:27:05.599 --> 02:27:09.062]  Why don't you give us the truth of the motive of why he committed this attack?
[02:27:09.442 --> 02:27:11.564]  Within hours they come out and say it's not terrorism.
[02:27:11.905 --> 02:27:13.106]  How can you possibly know that?
[02:27:13.366 --> 02:27:14.567]  You haven't even investigated it.
[02:27:14.687 --> 02:27:16.569]  Well Tommy, let me stop you.
[02:27:16.689 --> 02:27:19.231]  I want to walk through the Muslim grooming gangs, all of it with you.
[02:27:20.032 --> 02:27:25.379]  And we'll put your ex-account up there as well for people to follow you at Tommy Robinson New Era.
[02:27:25.980 --> 02:27:29.685]  But let's talk about the rally with 100,000 people and you getting arrested.
[02:27:29.705 --> 02:27:31.527]  The listeners are tuning in.
[02:27:31.547 --> 02:27:32.048]  You type it in.
[02:27:32.308 --> 02:27:36.013]  They said arrested on terrorism charges for peacefully speaking.
[02:27:36.454 --> 02:27:37.075]  What happened there?
[02:27:38.769 --> 02:27:39.590]  So I held the rally.
[02:27:39.610 --> 02:27:40.611]  100,000 people.
[02:27:40.651 --> 02:27:41.311]  We had music.
[02:27:41.331 --> 02:27:42.212]  We had a celebration.
[02:27:42.232 --> 02:27:43.133]  We had a beautiful day.
[02:27:43.173 --> 02:27:44.354]  An absolute beautiful day.
[02:27:44.374 --> 02:27:44.814]  Do you know what?
[02:27:44.834 --> 02:27:46.255]  It reinstalled it in the public.
[02:27:46.435 --> 02:27:47.716]  Do you know?
[02:27:47.736 --> 02:27:52.240]  I went to Poland years ago and I attended a rally with 100,000 people.
[02:27:52.700 --> 02:27:53.641]  And I felt jealous.
[02:27:53.961 --> 02:27:55.763]  And the hairs on the back of my neck stood up.
[02:27:56.123 --> 02:27:57.584]  And I said, look at the patriotism.
[02:27:57.624 --> 02:27:58.085]  Look at that.
[02:27:58.265 --> 02:27:59.386]  They know who they are.
[02:27:59.666 --> 02:28:01.107]  They're celebrating.
[02:28:01.167 --> 02:28:03.209]  It was for their 100 year anniversary of independence.
[02:28:03.569 --> 02:28:04.450]  They know who they are.
[02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:05.551]  We don't have that.
[02:28:05.991 --> 02:28:16.478]  I then come back to Britain, and last year I went to Ireland to make a documentary called Plantation II Rise of the Celts, and I saw the Irish out on the streets and it reignited the fire in my belly.
[02:28:16.818 --> 02:28:19.740]  And I thought, I don't want to look to other countries for inspiration.
[02:28:20.060 --> 02:28:21.521]  I want the world to look to Britain.
[02:28:21.861 --> 02:28:23.762]  I want the British to lead this resistance.
[02:28:24.022 --> 02:28:30.086]  So we started back on the streets, we started in November, and now it's led on to 100,000 people.
[02:28:30.406 --> 02:28:31.467]  The government are terrified.
[02:28:31.767 --> 02:28:34.990]  They're terrified because we now have the public with us.
[02:28:35.070 --> 02:28:36.711]  The public are supporting us.
[02:28:36.972 --> 02:28:42.396]  Now, the next morning after this, I went to Folkestone and I was arrested under terrorism charges.
[02:28:42.817 --> 02:28:44.518]  Now, I've sent you the forms, Alex.
[02:28:44.778 --> 02:28:48.021]  When I was arrested, I was arrested and the words were,
[02:28:49.848 --> 02:28:52.869]  Instigating and planning in the preparation of acts of terrorism.
[02:28:52.889 --> 02:28:56.030]  So this is the legislation they use to detain me.
[02:28:56.410 --> 02:29:02.152]  So they detain you for, they have six hours under this legislation and you have no right to remain silent.
[02:29:02.352 --> 02:29:02.752]  No right.
[02:29:02.852 --> 02:29:03.032]  Yeah.
[02:29:03.332 --> 02:29:09.314]  So if you don't, if you don't answer their questions, you breach terrorism laws and you're prosecuted under terrorism legislation.
[02:29:09.774 --> 02:29:14.138]  Then, you have no right not to give them your PIN codes for your phones and computers.
[02:29:14.498 --> 02:29:17.701]  So they seized the phones and they said, give us your PIN codes.
[02:29:18.121 --> 02:29:20.923]  Now as we sat down, do you know one of the words they questioned me on Alex?
[02:29:21.564 --> 02:29:23.946]  The whole six hours was insane.
[02:29:24.446 --> 02:29:30.911]  I said, you're sitting me down questioning me about my legitimate, legal, political activism.
[02:29:31.792 --> 02:29:34.554]  They said, how do you think?
[02:29:34.574 --> 02:29:38.017]  The first question was, what do you think of the state of the United Kingdom?
[02:29:38.821 --> 02:29:41.557]  I said it's a totalitarian shithole.
[02:29:42.182 --> 02:29:43.322]  And you've created that.
[02:29:43.502 --> 02:29:44.922]  And they said, well, what makes you say that?
[02:29:45.523 --> 02:29:52.984]  I said, I'm sat in here on a counter-terrorism interview where I don't have the right to remain silent, where you're about to prod me and question me on all my legal activity.
[02:29:53.444 --> 02:29:54.964]  It's a totalitarian shithole.
[02:29:55.264 --> 02:29:56.865]  You bring in laws.
[02:29:57.345 --> 02:29:59.025]  We have jihad attacks all the time.
[02:29:59.365 --> 02:30:03.186]  You bring in laws that take away the freedoms and then you put them on us.
[02:30:03.546 --> 02:30:10.927]  You're now sitting me under the laws that you've brought in to tackle people who you believe are about to immediately commit acts of terrorism.
[02:30:11.287 --> 02:30:16.790]  And they said, we know you're not a terrorist, but we can do this under these powers.
[02:30:17.250 --> 02:30:18.371]  And then they asked me for the pink.
[02:30:18.751 --> 02:30:23.233]  One of the questions they asked me is, how do you believe you're going to stop the Great Replacement?
[02:30:24.338 --> 02:30:25.498]  I'm like, is this for real?
[02:30:26.058 --> 02:30:27.119]  Are you actually serious?
[02:30:28.019 --> 02:30:28.779]  I was fuming.
[02:30:29.539 --> 02:30:30.319]  I missed my travel.
[02:30:30.619 --> 02:30:31.239]  I was fuming.
[02:30:31.479 --> 02:30:32.940]  And then they wanted my pin code.
[02:30:33.260 --> 02:30:34.380]  They asked me questions.
[02:30:34.740 --> 02:30:36.580]  So obviously I played a film.
[02:30:37.020 --> 02:30:46.822]  So at the demonstration three years ago, Alex, you remember, three, four years ago, I made a documentary and the judge prevented the public seeing the documentary.
[02:30:47.942 --> 02:30:51.143]  So I wasn't allowed to play the film or I'd face two years in prison.
[02:30:52.099 --> 02:30:57.623]  Well, when I had... Anyway, for those who don't know, the film was Muslims bragging about kidnapping and raping white girls.
[02:30:58.804 --> 02:31:01.245]  Well, the film was about threats, by one.
[02:31:01.265 --> 02:31:03.267]  The film was about a totally deceived story.
[02:31:03.647 --> 02:31:06.129]  It was a story about Syrian refugees.
[02:31:06.169 --> 02:31:07.570]  You were exposing the grooming gangs.
[02:31:09.031 --> 02:31:20.176]  Yeah, in this city, this is the city where the grooming gangs went on, but the documentary was more about the media's manipulation and lies and how they covered up a story and then changed the narrative for the public.
[02:31:20.476 --> 02:31:22.617]  And I wore covert recordings to prove all of this.
[02:31:22.897 --> 02:31:23.678]  People were paid.
[02:31:23.938 --> 02:31:24.898]  The government spent money.
[02:31:24.998 --> 02:31:28.340]  And they made you the bad guy for exposing massive child kidnapping rings.
[02:31:29.622 --> 02:31:30.883]  Yeah, and total corruption.
[02:31:31.124 --> 02:31:32.165]  So a total corruption.
[02:31:32.185 --> 02:31:33.146]  So give me an injunction.
[02:31:33.446 --> 02:31:34.988]  And on Saturday, I played that film.
[02:31:35.288 --> 02:31:38.692]  That film is currently on 25 million views on my on my ex account.
[02:31:38.972 --> 02:31:39.873]  So I'm a journalist.
[02:31:39.933 --> 02:31:41.635]  My job is to uncover corruption.
[02:31:41.875 --> 02:31:44.698]  But they and you know what, Alex, three years ago, I failed in my job.
[02:31:45.038 --> 02:31:50.141]  I failed in my job as an Englishman, and I failed in my job as a journalist, and I failed the British public.
[02:31:50.161 --> 02:31:55.745]  Because I was in... I had a documentary which totally proved their corruption.
[02:31:55.765 --> 02:31:58.387]  You did not fail, they suppressed you and put you in prison.
[02:31:58.747 --> 02:32:02.649]  But as you said, Elon Musk has literally cut... We have to give him praise.
[02:32:02.949 --> 02:32:04.030]  He's empowering everybody.
[02:32:04.050 --> 02:32:04.851]  We're devastating him.
[02:32:05.231 --> 02:32:05.771]  Thank God.
[02:32:05.811 --> 02:32:07.412]  Speak about Elon Musk and talk about your film.
[02:32:07.432 --> 02:32:08.213]  We'll play a clip from it.
[02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:12.980]  Well, without Elon Musk, the public would be told I lied.
[02:32:13.401 --> 02:32:15.881]  Without Elon Musk, the public would be told... And do you know what?
[02:32:15.901 --> 02:32:18.821]  This film had been leaked and it was on a YouTube channel.
[02:32:19.182 --> 02:32:21.922]  And two, they gave me a court date for Monday.
[02:32:21.942 --> 02:32:23.282]  I was supposed to be in court on Monday.
[02:32:23.582 --> 02:32:27.943]  They gave me a court date to prosecute me for contempt because the film was leaked two years ago.
[02:32:28.383 --> 02:32:29.883]  So they didn't come to me for two years.
[02:32:30.163 --> 02:32:38.665]  As soon as we held our big rally on the streets, the Attorney General, the government, this isn't the police, the government contacted my lawyers to say I'm being prosecuted.
[02:32:39.105 --> 02:32:43.550]  So, and then the YouTube video was deleted two weeks ago by YouTube.
[02:32:43.910 --> 02:32:51.498]  So they were preparing to send me to jail on Monday for two years and tell the world that I lied, because that's what they're narrating to me.
[02:32:51.518 --> 02:32:52.800]  But you're no longer in the UK.
[02:32:55.760 --> 02:33:00.383]  No, so two days before the court date, I decided to screen the film and show the world the truth.
[02:33:00.443 --> 02:33:05.126]  If you want me to send me to jail for two years, let the world know what it's for.
[02:33:05.447 --> 02:33:09.009]  Let the world know that you lied, you deceived, and you destroyed my life.
[02:33:09.089 --> 02:33:10.490]  And how satisfied are you now?
[02:33:10.510 --> 02:33:11.531]  I admire you so much.
[02:33:12.171 --> 02:33:16.895]  Tens of millions of views of your film and copies of it everywhere.
[02:33:17.935 --> 02:33:19.316]  How good does it feel now to do this?
[02:33:19.336 --> 02:33:20.457]  Because they're going to come after you again.
[02:33:20.477 --> 02:33:23.159]  You've already spent years in prison for free speech for people who don't know.
[02:33:24.983 --> 02:33:27.805]  Yeah, the judge has already issued a warrant for my arrest.
[02:33:28.166 --> 02:33:32.189]  The point is, I sit and think, well, they thought they were putting me on trial.
[02:33:32.729 --> 02:33:34.611]  I've just put them on trial to the whole world.
[02:33:34.991 --> 02:33:38.334]  The British judiciary and its reputation is on trial.
[02:33:38.654 --> 02:33:46.360]  When I do go back, now I am out of the country, Alex, because I took my children away for two weeks to enjoy some quiet time with my family before I go back and face this.
[02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:47.161]  That's a smart move.
[02:33:47.201 --> 02:33:49.903]  The problem that they've got, the problem that they've got,
[02:33:50.504 --> 02:33:52.284]  Is that 25 million people have seen the truth.
[02:33:52.725 --> 02:33:58.666]  And that 25 million, by the time they, I will not go quietly, by the time they get me into a prison, it'll be 40 or 50 million.
[02:33:58.966 --> 02:34:00.927]  I really hope that Elon Musk can find the time.
[02:34:00.967 --> 02:34:02.247]  I know how busy he must be.
[02:34:02.567 --> 02:34:05.368]  But this film, this film is far bigger than Tommy Robinson.
[02:34:05.608 --> 02:34:08.749]  This film nails the weaponization of the judiciary, Alex.
[02:34:08.969 --> 02:34:10.529]  It's what happened to you with a billion pounds.
[02:34:10.729 --> 02:34:12.430]  It's what happened to Donald Trump.
[02:34:12.690 --> 02:34:13.870]  It's what happened to Kurt Wilder.
[02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:17.911]  It is the weaponization of the court system to destroy political dissidents.
[02:34:18.251 --> 02:34:19.671]  And that's what we've seen across the West.
[02:34:19.911 --> 02:34:23.732]  But this film details it start to finish and proves it with covert recordings.
[02:34:24.033 --> 02:34:24.853]  It nails them.
[02:34:25.213 --> 02:34:37.396]  It's far bigger than the most... And I've seen the film, we talked about two years ago, I've privately viewed it, but my point is, you were exposing Muslim gang, grooming rape gangs, and the film's not about that, but it's about them persecuting you for that, the corruption.
[02:34:37.896 --> 02:34:38.576]  It's so powerful.
[02:34:38.616 --> 02:34:40.997]  Tell people how they watch it right now and how they share it.
[02:34:42.304 --> 02:34:46.166]  You can watch it by going to my Twitter handle, at T Robinson New Era.
[02:34:46.506 --> 02:34:47.447]  It's the pinned tweet.
[02:34:47.727 --> 02:34:53.390]  And watch it and share it, because if enough people see this, if they're going to send me to jail, jail's potentially death for me.
[02:34:53.690 --> 02:34:55.711]  Islamic Jihad gangs run every prison.
[02:34:56.011 --> 02:34:59.873]  If not, they'll put me on solitary confinement for two years, which will fry my mind.
[02:35:00.273 --> 02:35:04.075]  But I've worked in this field of my activism for 15 years.
[02:35:04.095 --> 02:35:05.176]  I've been in and out of jails.
[02:35:05.456 --> 02:35:06.116]  I've been beaten up.
[02:35:06.136 --> 02:35:08.858]  Yeah, by the way, weren't you in solitary for like a year already?
[02:35:10.020 --> 02:35:12.743]  I've spent a year of solitary for nothing, for nothing.
[02:35:13.043 --> 02:35:19.410]  But the problem they have now, when they had total censorship for five years, they could dictate and they could push the narrative.
[02:35:19.690 --> 02:35:21.612]  They don't have control of the narrative anymore.
[02:35:21.872 --> 02:35:28.499]  The public will now see the truth through X. Through X, people will hear my voice and hear the truth and see the film.
[02:35:28.759 --> 02:35:30.081]  So if they want to send me to jail,
[02:35:30.421 --> 02:35:32.123]  It's going to be every dig in their own grave.
[02:35:32.523 --> 02:35:36.327]  I'll happily go to jail and I'll come back out of jail.
[02:35:36.387 --> 02:35:41.612]  I said Justice Nicklin was the judge that ruled impossibly against every bit of evidence.
[02:35:41.892 --> 02:35:47.097]  He probably thought he'd be remembered as the most senior media judge out of the High Court of London.
[02:35:47.498 --> 02:35:49.640]  He's going to go down in history as a corrupt fraud.
[02:35:50.721 --> 02:35:53.643]  Wasn't he involved covering up Epstein stuff too?
[02:35:55.642 --> 02:36:08.593]  He was involved in, I can't comment, I think it was to do with Julian Assange as well, but I've since found out new evidence that Justice Nicklin fell out of his own father before my trial about me.
[02:36:09.194 --> 02:36:10.975]  He should have regressed himself from that trial.
[02:36:11.215 --> 02:36:17.140]  He sat on the trial and he ruled against me, but he didn't just rule against me, he ruled against the children who testified.
[02:36:17.361 --> 02:36:23.566]  He ruled against, for example Alex, I said that the Syrian refugee threatened to stab someone.
[02:36:23.966 --> 02:36:26.989]  What we found in his school records is that he did stab someone.
[02:36:27.329 --> 02:36:29.971]  We got covert recordings of pupils that he stabbed.
[02:36:30.351 --> 02:36:35.756]  We also found school records that say he got caught with a knife and screwdriver, but the judge still ruled against him.
[02:36:35.796 --> 02:36:40.159]  And tell me, the film's important, that's all amazing, but you had 100,000 people in Trafalgar Square.
[02:36:40.780 --> 02:36:42.521]  Tell us more about the interrogation.
[02:36:42.822 --> 02:36:46.024]  They're like, well, how are you going to stop the Great Replacement, which is an official UN plan?
[02:36:46.865 --> 02:36:50.848]  You're literally a patriot stopping an invasion and this crime wave, and they were literally,
[02:36:51.829 --> 02:36:53.569]  Why do you think they were asking these questions?
[02:36:53.589 --> 02:36:54.390]  What were the other questions?
[02:37:22.075 --> 02:37:24.597]  Yes, for radio listeners, we put the forms on air.
[02:37:24.637 --> 02:37:24.898]  Go ahead.
[02:37:36.143 --> 02:37:41.725]  I am a journalist, and I have uncovered grooming gangs from one end of this country to the other.
[02:37:41.985 --> 02:37:45.426]  I've done a five-part series called The Rape of Britain, five documentaries.
[02:37:45.446 --> 02:37:53.528]  You can watch them on my Rumble channel, Rumble Official, Tommy Robinson Official, or go to Urban Scoop, the company I work for, and just click on documentaries.
[02:37:53.948 --> 02:37:54.908]  In there, I've exposed
[02:37:55.769 --> 02:37:59.052]  Corrupt police officers who have worked alongside the gangs.
[02:37:59.372 --> 02:38:03.436]  In the Rotherham cases, the council and the police got rid of evidence.
[02:38:03.696 --> 02:38:05.738]  In the Rochdale case, they got rid of evidence.
[02:38:05.998 --> 02:38:10.062]  I said, why do you expect me to give you my sources of information?
[02:38:10.082 --> 02:38:13.285]  Because if you get into my phone, you can see all the people.
[02:38:13.345 --> 02:38:14.106]  It's my work phone.
[02:38:14.146 --> 02:38:14.767]  I'm a journalist.
[02:38:15.227 --> 02:38:17.369]  If you've took my phone, you've took my work phone.
[02:38:17.389 --> 02:38:19.071]  I want to shift gears out of that.
[02:38:19.471 --> 02:38:20.711]  This is so important the time we have with you.
[02:38:20.731 --> 02:38:22.532]  You've got to come back for like two hours if you can't soon.
[02:38:22.812 --> 02:38:23.372]  I love you, brother.
[02:38:23.392 --> 02:38:25.673]  One of my bucket lists is to meet you in person.
[02:38:25.693 --> 02:38:26.473]  You're such a hero.
[02:38:27.053 --> 02:38:28.674]  But you'll say you're not a hero.
[02:38:28.714 --> 02:38:29.134]  You're driven.
[02:38:29.154 --> 02:38:29.394]  I get it.
[02:38:29.434 --> 02:38:29.974]  I'm the same way.
[02:38:30.014 --> 02:38:34.696]  But explain to me how big this rally is and what they're going to do now.
[02:38:34.716 --> 02:38:39.357]  Because for people to think, oh, they just put labor in, that's because they voted out the conservatives because they were fake.
[02:38:39.537 --> 02:38:42.558]  Everywhere people are voting folks out, the numbers show people are awake.
[02:38:43.058 --> 02:38:49.181]  They've got to be in panic mode right now, and you have your Prime Minister defending this guy that murdered three little girls.
[02:38:49.621 --> 02:38:50.681]  I mean, these are sickos.
[02:38:51.202 --> 02:38:56.164]  And Sadiq Khan... 52% of the British public didn't vote, okay?
[02:38:56.304 --> 02:39:02.706]  So when we hear, like, Labour have been voted in... Labour got voted in off 18% of the British population, okay? 18%.
[02:39:04.347 --> 02:39:07.089]  So the majority, he doesn't have a mandate.
[02:39:07.109 --> 02:39:10.352]  The majority of this nation, 52% did not vote.
[02:39:10.912 --> 02:39:13.254]  They didn't vote because they don't trust politics.
[02:39:13.294 --> 02:39:16.337]  They don't trust the corrupt system.
[02:39:16.737 --> 02:39:21.401]  And if you look at our system, how it works, reform got four and a half million votes.
[02:39:22.324 --> 02:39:23.805]  They got five members of Parliament.
[02:39:24.105 --> 02:39:26.886]  The Liberal Democrats got three and a half million votes.
[02:39:26.906 --> 02:39:29.267]  They got 70 members of Parliament, OK?
[02:39:29.547 --> 02:39:31.708]  We have a corrupt system that works for the major parties.
[02:39:32.068 --> 02:39:33.028]  That's how it's always been.
[02:39:33.288 --> 02:39:34.669]  No one else is supposed to get in.
[02:39:34.949 --> 02:39:39.991]  And people celebrated that the Reform Party, who stand against open border immigration, got five MPs.
[02:39:40.231 --> 02:39:42.092]  We saw five pro-jihadists.
[02:39:43.092 --> 02:39:43.913]  MPs get elected.
[02:39:44.233 --> 02:39:48.216]  Independents, Muslim radical independents got elected into Parliament.
[02:39:48.496 --> 02:39:48.957]  Five of them.
[02:39:49.657 --> 02:39:54.480]  They will use our democratic system to end our democratic system.
[02:39:54.520 --> 02:39:58.923]  But the 100,000 people was a shock for the establishment.
[02:39:59.184 --> 02:40:00.084]  It's a shock for many.
[02:40:00.985 --> 02:40:07.349]  And not just that, our figures, I looked in the last three months, my reach has gone to 1.2 billion people on X.
[02:40:08.650 --> 02:40:12.233]  We cannot underestimate what Elon Musk has done.
[02:40:12.253 --> 02:40:14.674]  Anybody attacking him is a fool.
[02:40:14.835 --> 02:40:15.255]  He is 100% real.
[02:40:15.275 --> 02:40:15.895]  I'm worried for him.
[02:40:15.975 --> 02:40:16.436]  I'm worried for him.
[02:40:16.456 --> 02:40:17.316]  I'm really worried for him.
[02:40:25.856 --> 02:40:32.120]  Because we have a mini-revolution brewing right now in Great Britain because we have freedom of speech.
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:37.284]  We are able to reach the public, we're able to mobilize, we're able to... They gotta kill Musk, they gotta kill Trump.
[02:40:37.604 --> 02:40:39.525]  I told Musk that a month ago and he agreed.
[02:40:42.767 --> 02:40:43.328]  They have to.
[02:40:43.648 --> 02:40:44.268]  They have to.
[02:40:44.509 --> 02:40:47.310]  For their tyranny, if not, you're going to see people growing.
[02:40:47.711 --> 02:40:48.932]  The British are rising.
[02:40:48.992 --> 02:40:50.613]  I'm telling you, I see it every day.
[02:40:50.913 --> 02:40:52.054]  And what about the Irish?
[02:40:52.094 --> 02:40:52.994]  The Irish are rising up.
[02:40:55.751 --> 02:40:56.372]  The Irish are.
[02:40:56.792 --> 02:40:58.454]  And it was the Irish who inspired me.
[02:40:58.714 --> 02:41:00.516]  It was going to—my mum's Irish, Kate.
[02:41:00.636 --> 02:41:01.236]  My mum's Irish.
[02:41:01.296 --> 02:41:04.099]  And I've always said, with the fight in Irish, the Irish will rebel this.
[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:07.543]  And I went and watched in Ireland, and we were silent.
[02:41:07.563 --> 02:41:08.383]  We weren't on the street.
[02:41:08.664 --> 02:41:09.705]  So we've took it to the street.
[02:41:09.785 --> 02:41:14.990]  I think we've had a major success in both demonstrations, whereas they would have wanted to tar us
[02:41:15.390 --> 02:41:18.292]  As far right as hooligans, they weren't able to.
[02:41:18.593 --> 02:41:25.958]  So the next day, after these young children were stabbed, locals from the local area come out and attack the police.
[02:41:26.018 --> 02:41:34.805]  The reason being, the Romanian Gypsy community, one of them had their children taken off them in Harefield in the city of Leeds.
[02:41:35.826 --> 02:41:39.329]  They come out with the Muslim community and they rioted for an entire night.
[02:41:39.349 --> 02:41:42.471]  They burnt police cars, burnt buses, attacked police officers.
[02:41:42.771 --> 02:41:44.112]  The police run away.
[02:41:44.613 --> 02:41:46.434]  They threatened more riots.
[02:41:46.694 --> 02:41:48.776]  The police get back the children.
[02:41:49.236 --> 02:41:58.544]  Then the next day, this is after this, we see a Muslim get kicked in the head in Manchester Airport and then Muslims took to the streets.
[02:41:58.844 --> 02:42:01.286]  They went to Rochdale Police Station in their thousands.
[02:42:01.566 --> 02:42:04.308]  This is the same city that had all the young English girls raped.
[02:42:04.548 --> 02:42:05.789]  They never protested about that.
[02:42:06.049 --> 02:42:08.131]  But they were outside the police station in their thousands.
[02:42:08.451 --> 02:42:10.652]  They were threatening riots across our country.
[02:42:11.053 --> 02:42:18.758]  And then the police, so the two Muslims that were arrested at the airport, the police dropped all their charges and said there was insufficient evidence.
[02:42:19.138 --> 02:42:21.100]  The next day, someone released a video.
[02:42:21.420 --> 02:42:24.142]  The Muslims violently beat three police officers.
[02:42:24.382 --> 02:42:27.924]  They punched one police woman to the floor, breaking her nose.
[02:42:27.964 --> 02:42:28.745]  I've seen the video.
[02:42:28.805 --> 02:42:30.646]  And then they spun it to the police and attacked them.
[02:42:30.666 --> 02:42:31.127]  So here's the deal.
[02:42:31.727 --> 02:42:34.955]  Thomas Jefferson said, when the government fears the people, there's liberty.
[02:42:34.975 --> 02:42:36.919]  When the people fear the government, there's tyranny.
[02:42:36.939 --> 02:42:40.567]  The British government, the Irish government does not fear the people, but they're starting to, aren't they?
[02:42:41.940 --> 02:42:43.801]  They're starting to 100%.
[02:42:43.901 --> 02:42:47.182]  We are mobilising and we showed that on the 27th.
[02:42:47.482 --> 02:42:48.743]  I don't think they know what to do.
[02:42:49.183 --> 02:42:54.945]  So that's why they, them detaining me on terrorism legislation just doubled the amount of people who watch my film.
[02:42:55.326 --> 02:42:56.926]  It's clearly a reaction to my film.
[02:42:56.946 --> 02:43:01.048]  And I'm waiting because then they put out a warrant for my arrest.
[02:43:01.488 --> 02:43:10.832]  So I'm now going to be prosecuted in the High Court of London as a journalist in 2024 in Great Britain facing custody for years for making a film.
[02:43:11.572 --> 02:43:13.374]  A film that shows the truth.
[02:43:13.794 --> 02:43:19.638]  A film that is covert recordings of teachers talking, telling us they got paid not to tell the truth.
[02:43:20.059 --> 02:43:23.701]  So I'll ask the judge when I go to court, have you seen the film?
[02:43:24.162 --> 02:43:25.342]  What part of evidence do you have?
[02:43:25.362 --> 02:43:28.585]  And why are you taking part in covering up little girls kidnapping and rape?
[02:43:29.815 --> 02:43:33.416]  And then the thing is, they're not saying that anything I've said is incorrect.
[02:43:33.716 --> 02:43:35.577]  They just don't want you, the public, to see it.
[02:43:35.817 --> 02:43:38.998]  This isn't about deceiving me or silencing you, Alex, or silencing us.
[02:43:39.298 --> 02:43:43.699]  It's about deceiving the entire British, American, Western public.
[02:43:44.020 --> 02:43:47.441]  They want to deceive you while they flood our nations, and then it's too late.
[02:43:47.741 --> 02:43:51.022]  By the time everyone wakes up and realizes, it's going to be too late.
[02:43:51.242 --> 02:43:53.142]  This is the most pivotal time in our country.
[02:43:53.162 --> 02:43:53.503]  It is.
[02:43:53.543 --> 02:43:54.543]  Tommy, stay there.
[02:43:55.603 --> 02:43:57.404]  Tommy, cover your film, coming up.
[02:43:58.154 --> 02:44:08.009]  There are a lot of amazing green drinks out there, and the amount of evidence is just massive of how good they are for our whole bodies, but especially our guts.
[02:44:08.509 --> 02:44:11.254]  Our immune systems, our vitality, it's so important.
[02:44:11.274 --> 02:44:13.637]  But not all of them are made equal.
[02:44:14.398 --> 02:44:17.642]  I couldn't operate in the last 10 years without my morning green drink.
[02:44:18.122 --> 02:44:23.909]  And I'm telling you folks, when I started trying this product just about six months ago, it was game-changing.

[02:45:33.355 --> 02:45:40.721]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's salt palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[02:45:41.141 --> 02:45:44.784]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[02:45:44.804 --> 02:45:46.125]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[02:45:46.145 --> 02:45:56.193]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWars MD.
[02:45:58.004 --> 02:45:58.324]  All right.
[02:45:58.525 --> 02:46:00.466]  Got about 15 minutes left with Tommy Robinson.
[02:46:01.127 --> 02:46:02.889]  Amazing historical time happening.
[02:46:02.929 --> 02:46:08.794]  Repeat what you were saying during the break to me about the awakening that's happening and let's start talking about your film and the clips we're going to play next segment.
[02:46:13.417 --> 02:46:15.259]  I said I've been doing this 15 years.
[02:46:15.299 --> 02:46:16.240]  The public weren't ready.
[02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:17.961]  They haven't been ready to listen.
[02:46:18.001 --> 02:46:18.842]  They didn't want to listen.
[02:46:19.303 --> 02:46:19.963]  They're ready now.
[02:46:20.304 --> 02:46:21.245]  I'm telling you, they're ready.
[02:46:21.585 --> 02:46:23.326]  They're ready from one end of Britain to the other.
[02:46:23.707 --> 02:46:27.290]  I know right now as we're talking, Alex, riots are kicking off in Sunderland.
[02:46:27.651 --> 02:46:30.013]  There's 20 cities that demonstrations are coming out.
[02:46:30.313 --> 02:46:31.034]  I know it's not.
[02:46:31.174 --> 02:46:32.215]  I try and say to people,
[02:46:33.630 --> 02:46:37.312]  The anger from the British public is 100% justified.
[02:46:37.632 --> 02:46:42.495]  The men in these hotels have raped, committed murder, jihad across the country.
[02:46:42.735 --> 02:46:47.517]  The government are placing undocumented migrants they know nothing about into towns and cities.
[02:46:47.878 --> 02:46:50.079]  Parents feel they've got no safety for their kids anymore.
[02:46:50.379 --> 02:46:50.819]  It's gone.
[02:46:51.179 --> 02:46:53.801]  We feel lost as a nation.
[02:46:53.881 --> 02:47:00.224]  So what we managed to do in two successful events with a lot of hard work was control and harness that anger.
[02:47:00.504 --> 02:47:10.016]  What you're seeing now, over the last three days, and what you're going to see in the coming weeks, is unharnessed, raw emotion and anger, frustration, resentment, all of it.
[02:47:10.276 --> 02:47:12.579]  People are furious, they're raging.
[02:47:12.699 --> 02:47:15.162]  And the same thing is happening in Ireland.
[02:47:15.302 --> 02:47:15.983]  Same thing in Ireland.
[02:47:17.901 --> 02:47:19.042]  They've took away their safety.
[02:47:19.322 --> 02:47:22.024]  They've took away the safety of your children.
[02:47:22.264 --> 02:47:23.345]  And people now know that.
[02:47:23.825 --> 02:47:29.168]  They've brought in people who are hostile and violent to our nation, who are never going to integrate or assimilate.
[02:47:29.489 --> 02:47:29.909]  Ever.
[02:47:30.149 --> 02:47:31.170]  It's not going to work.
[02:47:31.370 --> 02:47:32.530]  You've mixed oil and water.
[02:47:32.771 --> 02:47:33.431]  And they knew it.
[02:47:33.751 --> 02:47:35.552]  They knew what they were doing when they were bringing them in.
[02:47:35.913 --> 02:47:37.774]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[02:47:38.074 --> 02:47:39.535]  And people are going to be that furious.
[02:47:40.656 --> 02:47:42.397]  And what the government, the police have said,
[02:47:42.857 --> 02:47:48.280]  Every image of the police dealing with Black Lives Matter, dealing with Muslims, they're running away and they hide, yeah?
[02:47:48.941 --> 02:47:50.282]  And then they get what they want.
[02:47:50.562 --> 02:47:53.704]  So the message that's been sent to the British, you need to get violent.
[02:47:53.784 --> 02:47:55.184]  That's what the message the government have said.
[02:47:55.485 --> 02:47:56.485]  If you're violent, we'll listen.
[02:47:56.885 --> 02:47:59.587]  If you're hostile, if you're really violent and aggressive, we'll listen.
[02:47:59.847 --> 02:48:03.189]  And unfortunately now, young Englishmen are on the streets rioting.
[02:48:03.589 --> 02:48:07.091]  I'd give a message to those men, you're going to go to jail for a long time, okay?
[02:48:07.272 --> 02:48:09.173]  You're going to get locked up for a long time.
[02:48:09.193 --> 02:48:11.154]  They're going to come down on you like a ton of bricks.
[02:48:11.394 --> 02:48:15.736]  Donate to political parties, run for office, be politically motivated, don't be violent.
[02:48:17.217 --> 02:48:20.258]  Don't be violent, because, don't be violent, but I understand their anger.
[02:48:20.519 --> 02:48:22.159]  I understand why they're feeling this way.
[02:48:22.359 --> 02:48:23.880]  They've been forced down this path.
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:28.022]  The government have forced them, the police have forced them to this position, where they've told them.
[02:48:28.302 --> 02:48:29.703]  No, no, they're not wrong.
[02:48:29.723 --> 02:48:31.304]  We just have to be more strategic.
[02:48:33.021 --> 02:48:35.803]  We have to be more strategic and more organised.
[02:48:35.843 --> 02:48:37.824]  And that's what we've done in our last two demonstrations.
[02:48:38.204 --> 02:48:48.930]  We had, in that 100,000 people in London, we had some of the toughest men in Great Britain, OK, travel together from cities across this country to stand.
[02:48:48.970 --> 02:48:51.672]  If they wanted to riot and destroy that whole capital city, they could have done.
[02:48:51.952 --> 02:48:52.752]  And the police know that.
[02:48:53.112 --> 02:48:57.675]  But we harnessed that anger and we directed it into a peaceful festival of celebration
[02:48:58.175 --> 02:48:59.897]  But where we give them a strong message.
[02:49:00.217 --> 02:49:04.441]  I said to the people, 15 years ago when I started my activism, I put on a balaclava.
[02:49:04.721 --> 02:49:06.182]  I was an angry young man, OK?
[02:49:06.422 --> 02:49:07.624]  But we had no voice.
[02:49:08.044 --> 02:49:09.325]  We now have a voice.
[02:49:09.705 --> 02:49:11.727]  We have millions listening to us every day.
[02:49:11.967 --> 02:49:14.189]  We're reaching the public across this country.
[02:49:14.610 --> 02:49:15.871]  Take off the balaclavas.
[02:49:16.131 --> 02:49:17.152]  Take off the masks.
[02:49:17.472 --> 02:49:21.095]  OK, take off the masks and let us deliver them a blow, heathily.
[02:49:21.455 --> 02:49:27.119]  Let us bring, let us win the hearts and minds of the country, which we're in the process of doing.
[02:49:27.359 --> 02:49:36.885]  But at the minute, I think over the next few weeks, you're going to see frustration and anger boiling over because rapes are happening by illegal aliens, illegal migrants to our government.
[02:49:37.165 --> 02:49:41.188]  All the politicians are holding up signs saying refugees welcome, when they're not living in your houses.
[02:49:41.548 --> 02:49:42.628]  They're not raping your daughters.
[02:49:42.968 --> 02:49:47.950]  Your women can still walk down the streets in your little bubbles that you live in where your security gates are.
[02:49:48.170 --> 02:49:51.671]  In working class towns across this country, our women are scared.
[02:49:51.951 --> 02:49:52.991]  They shouldn't be scared.
[02:49:53.211 --> 02:49:54.851]  They can't walk down their own streets.
[02:49:54.871 --> 02:49:58.312]  And for too long, we've talked like it's not our country.
[02:49:58.632 --> 02:50:00.053]  This is our country.
[02:50:00.433 --> 02:50:01.193]  You're guests.
[02:50:01.713 --> 02:50:05.414]  You've been invited in as guests and you've overstayed your welcome in many towns and cities now.
[02:50:05.894 --> 02:50:07.996]  You're frustrated, you've raped, you've pillaged.
[02:50:08.296 --> 02:50:11.598]  You've come here and disrespected our country every single day.
[02:50:12.099 --> 02:50:12.979]  And people are fed up.
[02:50:13.379 --> 02:50:15.481]  And people are fed up because they see no solution.
[02:50:15.781 --> 02:50:16.982]  Keir Starmer's just come out.
[02:50:17.442 --> 02:50:18.883]  He hasn't addressed all the rapes.
[02:50:19.164 --> 02:50:24.007]  He's never come out with an emergency meeting to deal with the stabbings or the attacks on English women.
[02:50:24.367 --> 02:50:30.892]  He's come out with an emergency meeting to label every single person who's coming out, the mothers, the families, as far right.
[02:50:31.493 --> 02:50:32.414]  Let's talk about that.
[02:50:32.474 --> 02:50:33.796]  Back in 60 seconds.
[02:50:33.816 --> 02:50:37.341]  In Europe, it's something like 80% of the rape is the foreigners.
[02:50:37.862 --> 02:50:38.863]  And it's the same thing in England.
[02:50:38.883 --> 02:50:40.325]  People aren't putting up with this crap anymore.
[02:50:40.986 --> 02:50:42.869]  Sadiq Khan needs to move his ass out.
[02:50:43.510 --> 02:50:45.573]  All of them need to get the hell out and go burn in hell.
[02:50:46.334 --> 02:50:47.734]  Go back to your own shithole countries.
[02:50:48.175 --> 02:50:52.076]  The dauntless, the intrepid, the committed Tommy Robinson.
[02:50:52.756 --> 02:50:54.957]  I've been interviewing him for 15 years.
[02:50:54.977 --> 02:50:57.498]  This is his little town running a tanning salon.
[02:50:57.878 --> 02:51:04.320]  He saw the Islamists kidnapping little girls and selling them to sex slavery, even killing them, and began to speak out.
[02:51:04.440 --> 02:51:06.581]  And now he is helping lead
[02:51:07.401 --> 02:51:08.403]  We're good to go.
[02:51:25.003 --> 02:51:25.623]  New era.
[02:51:26.004 --> 02:51:27.585]  And we'll put it up on screen right there.
[02:51:28.025 --> 02:51:30.106]  Then you'll find the film silenced and shared.
[02:51:30.446 --> 02:51:30.927]  You're right.
[02:51:30.967 --> 02:51:31.907]  We need must to pin it.
[02:51:31.947 --> 02:51:33.328]  It doesn't need 25 million views.
[02:51:33.768 --> 02:51:35.029]  It needs a billion views.
[02:51:35.509 --> 02:51:37.911]  This is the UN Replacement Migration Invasion.
[02:51:38.331 --> 02:51:39.132]  Their own plan.
[02:51:39.152 --> 02:51:40.432]  You just got arrested for terrorism.
[02:51:40.732 --> 02:51:42.273]  For leaving 100,000 people peacefully.
[02:51:42.614 --> 02:51:43.714]  The enemy is scared.
[02:51:43.734 --> 02:51:44.455]  We salute you.
[02:51:44.755 --> 02:51:45.595]  Tell us about the film.
[02:51:45.635 --> 02:51:46.436]  We'll play a clip from it.
[02:51:47.836 --> 02:51:49.057]  The film is incredible.
[02:51:49.137 --> 02:51:50.358]  I'm not just saying it because it's mine.
[02:51:50.398 --> 02:51:53.520]  It's the best piece and the most important piece of investigative journalism I've ever done.
[02:51:53.920 --> 02:52:00.505]  When you watch this film, you realize the lengths they go to to control the narrative and the lies and deceit they tell and how they will all work together.
[02:52:00.745 --> 02:52:06.169]  The unholy alliance of lawyers, solicitors, lawyers, solicitors, courts, judges, police, media.
[02:52:06.429 --> 02:52:09.731]  They all work together to destroy anyone who gets in their way of the narrative.
[02:52:09.771 --> 02:52:10.832]  It doesn't matter what the narrative is.
[02:52:11.132 --> 02:52:14.415]  And Alex, if you can, if you can please quote tweet it and ask your people to watch it.
[02:52:14.735 --> 02:52:19.158]  As I said, if I'm going to go jail to it, if they're going to lock me up, the world needs to see this.
[02:52:19.178 --> 02:52:25.283]  You know, like we all suspect the courts have been weaponized with your billion pound case, with what happened to Donald Trump.
[02:52:25.523 --> 02:52:27.424]  Well, this categorically proves it.
[02:52:27.745 --> 02:52:28.325]  It's evidence.
[02:52:28.645 --> 02:52:30.847]  This shows the corruption of the judiciary.
[02:52:31.047 --> 02:52:32.068]  I haven't gone before a judge.
[02:52:32.088 --> 02:52:33.589]  I haven't gone before a judge.
[02:52:33.609 --> 02:52:35.471]  No, you have all the undercover videos.
[02:52:35.491 --> 02:52:37.092]  So right now, the cruel retweeted for me.
[02:52:37.672 --> 02:52:44.419]  We're going to say, see Tommy Robinson's viral film, Silenced, that just got him charged with terrorism.
[02:52:44.839 --> 02:52:50.104]  See Tommy Robinson's viral film, Silenced, that just got him charged with terrorism.
[02:52:50.745 --> 02:52:53.067]  We're going to re-put that on Alex Jones right now.
[02:52:53.127 --> 02:52:53.808]  Real Alex Jones.
[02:52:53.828 --> 02:52:54.549]  Put that out, guys.
[02:52:54.989 --> 02:52:57.491]  I put most of my tweets out, but I tell them to do stuff for me.
[02:52:57.512 --> 02:52:58.492]  You're absolutely right.
[02:52:58.532 --> 02:52:58.873]  Continue.
[02:53:00.783 --> 02:53:04.447]  I think if Elon Musk shares this film, it may save my life, yeah?
[02:53:04.787 --> 02:53:06.188]  Because they're locking me up.
[02:53:06.529 --> 02:53:10.392]  Now, locking me up is possible or probable death in the prison system.
[02:53:10.413 --> 02:53:11.413]  Maybe that's what they want, yeah?
[02:53:11.734 --> 02:53:12.515]  Maybe that's what they want.
[02:53:12.535 --> 02:53:14.216]  And by the way, you tried to go to Canada.
[02:53:14.256 --> 02:53:15.237]  They arrested you there.
[02:53:15.317 --> 02:53:16.218]  I wish you would just come here.
[02:53:16.238 --> 02:53:17.840]  You're a political refugee.
[02:53:17.880 --> 02:53:18.981]  You're a political prisoner.
[02:53:21.829 --> 02:53:27.797]  I would love to come to the United States for America, Alex, but I'd wait till Trump wins, man, and then I'd be desperate to.
[02:53:28.298 --> 02:53:28.838]  I'd love to.
[02:53:28.858 --> 02:53:30.120]  Do you know why I'd love to?
[02:53:30.481 --> 02:53:34.746]  Because I'm the perfect person to tell the story of what happens, yeah?
[02:53:35.007 --> 02:53:36.469]  And America, you need to brace yourself.
[02:53:36.809 --> 02:53:42.752]  For the last four years, your borders have been open and flooded, not with Mexican, not with Hispanics, yeah?
[02:53:43.092 --> 02:53:46.494]  With Eritrean, Somalian, Pakistani, Afghani, Syrian.
[02:53:46.774 --> 02:53:50.216]  They are importing Islam in their millions into your country.
[02:53:50.496 --> 02:53:52.898]  You haven't seen anything yet, trust me.
[02:53:53.218 --> 02:53:58.341]  The cultural problems, the violence, the hostility that's coming, and it comes like that, yeah?
[02:53:58.601 --> 02:54:04.304]  You need to prepare yourselves, because I've always seen when Americans talk about open border immigration, they moan about the Mexicans.
[02:54:05.004 --> 02:54:08.167]  Jesus, you have no idea what's coming to the Pakistanis or the Afghanis.
[02:54:08.507 --> 02:54:09.308]  You've got no idea.
[02:54:09.608 --> 02:54:10.509]  No, it's true.
[02:54:10.529 --> 02:54:13.952]  The Mexicans integrate very well into the country, but not the Islamics.
[02:54:15.609 --> 02:54:16.169]  They're not gonna.
[02:54:16.249 --> 02:54:16.890]  They're never gonna.
[02:54:17.290 --> 02:54:17.970]  They're never gonna.
[02:54:18.270 --> 02:54:19.591]  That doesn't mean every Muslim is bad.
[02:54:19.631 --> 02:54:20.271]  Of course it doesn't.
[02:54:20.291 --> 02:54:21.051]  Let's talk sensibly.
[02:54:21.071 --> 02:54:21.472]  It doesn't.
[02:54:21.832 --> 02:54:28.515]  But, per se, you're mixing oil and water and the ideology and the teachings of it do not allow them to integrate or assimilate.
[02:54:28.535 --> 02:54:30.495]  They come to dominate, to subjugate.
[02:54:30.776 --> 02:54:31.776]  That's what they're coming for.
[02:54:32.036 --> 02:54:34.257]  They're coming to your country to change your country.
[02:54:34.477 --> 02:54:35.417]  They're never gonna change.
[02:54:35.778 --> 02:54:37.358]  Islam hasn't changed in 1400 years.
[02:54:37.598 --> 02:54:38.779]  They expect you to change.
[02:54:38.959 --> 02:54:41.160]  And I'll tell you what, Great Britain's changed for them.
[02:54:41.620 --> 02:54:47.863]  Many of our cities, if you're American and you were thinking about visiting London to see Great Britain, it's not there anymore!
[02:54:48.463 --> 02:54:49.223]  It's not there!
[02:54:49.623 --> 02:54:53.265]  And our problem is, it's not there in many towns and cities across our country.
[02:54:53.505 --> 02:54:54.325]  They've changed beyond recognition.
[02:54:54.345 --> 02:54:59.827]  Let me tell you what I've noticed, let me tell you what I've noticed, because I've been to the UK probably 20 times, and I've been going there for, you know, 50 years, 40 years, but...
[02:55:01.508 --> 02:55:12.677]  The last few times I was there, I would just be videotaping Big Bend or, you know, the Palace or Trafalgar Square, and Muslims will run over and scream at me and say, don't videotape me, even though I'm not.
[02:55:13.158 --> 02:55:15.099]  And as soon as they see I'm not cucked, they back off.
[02:55:15.139 --> 02:55:16.000]  I get back in their face.
[02:55:16.340 --> 02:55:20.764]  But I guess they're so used to intimidating, and I see them intimidating Britons.
[02:55:20.784 --> 02:55:21.785]  People just bow down to them.
[02:55:21.805 --> 02:55:22.926]  But you're saying that's coming to an end?
[02:55:24.389 --> 02:55:25.590]  I'd say it's coming to an end right now.
[02:55:25.950 --> 02:55:27.211]  I'd say that we've turned the corner.
[02:55:27.271 --> 02:55:28.112]  We need to turn.
[02:55:28.693 --> 02:55:36.219]  It's a worrying time because the anger, the level of anger right now, as I said, we held our last demonstration just a week ago.
[02:55:36.499 --> 02:55:38.701]  But since then, anger's boiling over.
[02:55:38.721 --> 02:55:39.822]  I'm just looking at scenes now.
[02:55:39.842 --> 02:55:41.984]  There's riots right now, as we're saying now.
[02:55:42.992 --> 02:55:44.493]  The English are rioting in Sunderland.
[02:55:44.973 --> 02:55:46.874]  The English rioted in Leeds two days ago.
[02:55:47.235 --> 02:55:48.635]  The English rioted in other cities.
[02:55:49.136 --> 02:55:51.677]  So they have pushed people so far.
[02:55:52.638 --> 02:55:56.760]  And again, I appeal to these young lads because they're just going to ruin their lives.
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:55:59.842]  But the problem is they see no other way.
[02:56:00.422 --> 02:56:01.623]  People are that desperate.
[02:56:01.803 --> 02:56:02.924]  They're looking at their country.
[02:56:02.944 --> 02:56:03.885]  It's disappearing.
[02:56:04.085 --> 02:56:06.187]  And whilst it's disappearing, what are our politicians doing?
[02:56:06.487 --> 02:56:07.568]  They're bringing more in.
[02:56:07.849 --> 02:56:11.412]  People can't afford to turn their heating on, and these migrants are in four-star hotels.
[02:56:11.672 --> 02:56:13.073]  People can't get dentist appointments.
[02:56:13.093 --> 02:56:14.554]  They're having to pull their own teeth out.
[02:56:14.754 --> 02:56:16.656]  These migrants go straight to the front of the queue.
[02:56:16.856 --> 02:56:17.657]  They've got everything.
[02:56:17.977 --> 02:56:18.618]  They've got apps.
[02:56:18.638 --> 02:56:19.639]  They put nothing in.
[02:56:20.219 --> 02:56:21.380]  Nothing into the system.
[02:56:21.420 --> 02:56:22.101]  Take everything out.
[02:56:22.461 --> 02:56:23.782]  We're literally being replaced.
[02:56:23.842 --> 02:56:29.504]  Well, that's what's pissing black folks off, that they see the illegal aliens come and taking their jobs, getting everything free.
[02:56:29.544 --> 02:56:32.585]  And getting everything.
[02:56:32.665 --> 02:56:35.306]  But there is a mass, I call it the mass, there is a mass awakening.
[02:56:35.686 --> 02:56:38.988]  I know it by my direct messages, because every single message is an apology.
[02:56:39.288 --> 02:56:40.128]  Tommy, I hated you.
[02:56:40.148 --> 02:56:41.129]  Tommy, I believed the media.
[02:56:41.349 --> 02:56:43.129]  Tommy, I can't believe that I'm now on your side.
[02:56:43.670 --> 02:56:46.011]  And people, and Alex, you must have seen the same.
[02:56:46.291 --> 02:56:47.851]  People like us were seen as lepers.
[02:56:48.071 --> 02:56:49.172]  They made us lepers.
[02:56:49.192 --> 02:56:49.752]  No, no, I agree.
[02:56:49.792 --> 02:56:51.893]  The globalists are in trouble, because I never talk about my...
[02:56:52.313 --> 02:56:54.014]  I don't tell the story to people about me, it's true.
[02:56:54.655 --> 02:56:57.497]  When Trump got elected, I got a 20% hate, 80% love.
[02:56:57.957 --> 02:56:59.418]  I get yelled at once a month now.
[02:56:59.578 --> 02:57:02.741]  I get love, dinner bought everywhere, nothing but love.
[02:57:02.781 --> 02:57:04.062]  Black people, brown people, everybody.
[02:57:04.422 --> 02:57:05.403]  People are really awake.
[02:57:05.423 --> 02:57:06.263]  So talk about the film.
[02:57:06.583 --> 02:57:07.364]  Let's play a clip here.
[02:57:07.384 --> 02:57:09.346]  We got a short clip from your film, Silenced.
[02:57:09.366 --> 02:57:09.706]  Here it is.
[02:57:12.503 --> 02:57:16.424]  The documentary you're about to watch is the most important documentary I've ever made.
[02:57:16.844 --> 02:57:19.385]  This story is far bigger than Tommy Robinson.
[02:57:19.705 --> 02:57:23.027]  This is about the weaponisation and the politicisation of these buildings.
[02:57:23.427 --> 02:57:24.727]  Court buildings across the West.
[02:57:25.207 --> 02:57:27.408]  The Royal Courts of Justice, ironically named.
[02:57:27.708 --> 02:57:32.530]  These buildings have been weaponised and used against members of the public to destroy them if they speak out.
[02:57:32.830 --> 02:57:37.431]  From Donald Trump, to Steve Bannon, to Gert Wilders, to Marie Le Pen, to Katie Hopkins.
[02:57:37.792 --> 02:57:38.912]  That's what's happening.
[02:57:39.272 --> 02:57:43.635]  My job as a journalist, I stand for freedom of speech, I stand for freedom of the press, and I failed.
[02:57:43.875 --> 02:57:51.919]  Because three years ago when I lost a court case in here, and they bankrupt me to the tune of £1.6 million, on a documentary you're going to see, the entire story was a lie.
[02:57:52.900 --> 02:57:55.401]  I failed because I should have come out of court and I should have played you that film.
[02:57:55.942 --> 02:57:57.002]  Why didn't I play you that film?
[02:57:57.102 --> 02:58:00.104]  Because I was given a gagging order by this building, by this judge.
[02:58:00.644 --> 02:58:03.106]  I was silenced, and I allowed them to silence me.
[02:58:03.686 --> 02:58:04.506]  Because I was scared.
[02:58:04.526 --> 02:58:06.207]  I was scared of two years in prison.
[02:58:06.588 --> 02:58:10.130]  I was scared of the effect solitary confinement for that length of time would have on me.
[02:58:10.490 --> 02:58:12.111]  I was scared of jihadi gangs in jail.
[02:58:12.591 --> 02:58:15.272]  And I was scared of the effect it would have on my family.
[02:58:15.753 --> 02:58:17.294]  I failed me and I failed you.
[02:58:17.314 --> 02:58:19.155]  I'm not going to fail myself again.
[02:58:19.775 --> 02:58:26.799]  You're now going to watch the best citizen journalism and the most incredible expose of the establishment you've ever seen.
[02:58:33.809 --> 02:58:36.913]  The news is how we find out what's happening in the world.
[02:58:37.734 --> 02:58:39.156]  It's how we form our opinions.
[02:58:40.237 --> 02:58:41.559]  Opinions based on facts.
[02:58:42.460 --> 02:58:43.161]  That's the key.
[02:58:43.922 --> 02:58:44.323]  Facts.
[02:58:45.164 --> 02:58:48.848]  Facts should be delivered to you by journalists based on the truth.
[02:58:49.994 --> 02:58:52.295]  But what if what they're delivering you isn't the truth?
[02:58:53.095 --> 02:58:56.556]  What if it's stories that are manipulated to make you think a certain way?
[02:58:57.096 --> 02:58:58.477]  To follow a certain narrative?
[02:58:59.137 --> 02:59:00.397]  Different people's agendas?
[02:59:01.097 --> 02:59:04.659]  And what do they do to those who go against that mainstream narrative?
[02:59:05.179 --> 02:59:07.779]  Those who try to expose the truth?
[02:59:08.480 --> 02:59:17.182]  This is a documentary about the lengths they will go to to shut down and silence anyone from bringing you, the British public, the truth.
[02:59:17.482 --> 02:59:19.143]  Right, Jamal, they are opposite, aren't they?
[02:59:19.523 --> 02:59:20.884]  I lost my job over this.
[02:59:21.124 --> 02:59:22.284]  I'm undisclosed up in this.
[02:59:22.665 --> 02:59:23.745]  He's a nasty little piece of shit.
[02:59:23.765 --> 02:59:26.747]  He just wung the hockey stick over his head and hit me in the spine with it.
[02:59:26.767 --> 02:59:28.968]  Well, it's all better than he wouldn't do anything.
[02:59:29.068 --> 02:59:30.869]  This kid was out unconscious already.
[02:59:31.169 --> 02:59:32.149]  That's just malicious.
[02:59:32.169 --> 02:59:32.830]  I'm not signing you.
[02:59:32.870 --> 02:59:33.930]  You're not going anywhere.
[02:59:33.950 --> 02:59:35.351]  No, because what yous are doing, I know what yous are doing.
[02:59:35.491 --> 02:59:37.712]  Tommy, I am going to miss you kids, mate.
[02:59:42.344 --> 02:59:47.647]  This is a documentary about the unholy alliance between the media, the justice system, and our politicians.
[02:59:48.228 --> 02:59:55.412]  How they conspire to suppress free speech, how they pervert democracy, and how the truth and your freedoms are just two of the casualties.
[02:59:55.792 --> 03:00:07.600]  We will show how the mainstream media deceives people, how they ignore the truth, how the lies of The Virtue Signaling, BBC, ITV, and Channel 4 are all about their poisonous agenda, no matter the cost to innocent people.
[03:00:08.440 --> 03:00:19.665]  It's also a documentary about how an everyday playground incident between two young lads was spun into global news, at a terrible cost to so many people, not least the two young lads themselves.
[03:00:20.305 --> 03:00:32.771]  We will show how the law is being abused, how people driven by hateful ideologies attempt to intimidate and silence anyone who dares to challenge the so-called progressive, so-called liberal narrative.
[03:00:33.371 --> 03:00:36.713]  We will show the foolishness of our fear-driven political... Alright, let's stop right there.
[03:00:36.854 --> 03:00:37.914]  I've seen the film.
[03:00:38.535 --> 03:00:39.375]  Everybody should watch it.
[03:00:39.415 --> 03:00:40.676]  I posted it at Rail Alex Jones.
[03:00:40.696 --> 03:00:42.578]  Tommy, it's been a year since you've been on.
[03:00:42.618 --> 03:00:44.139]  You've got to get on next week.
[03:00:44.159 --> 03:00:44.779]  We'll do it again.
[03:00:44.799 --> 03:00:48.642]  Before... I would tell you, stay out of the UK for more than two weeks.
[03:00:49.343 --> 03:00:50.363]  Take time with your family.
[03:00:50.423 --> 03:00:51.464]  Please don't go right back there.
[03:00:52.325 --> 03:00:53.726]  Let this build, please.
[03:00:55.802 --> 03:00:58.863]  I'm pretty sure what the judges said is that I have till October.
[03:00:59.923 --> 03:01:00.904]  That's what the judges said.
[03:01:01.424 --> 03:01:07.025]  But between now and October, I'm going to pour petrol on the fire, sat here.
[03:01:07.105 --> 03:01:09.746]  I've got a lot of podcasts, a lot of interviews set up.
[03:01:09.946 --> 03:01:11.347]  I've got Jordan Peterson Part 2.
[03:01:11.807 --> 03:01:14.688]  I've got some big ones lined up, Alex.
[03:01:14.708 --> 03:01:17.128]  So I'll talk as much as we can, bro.
[03:01:17.488 --> 03:01:19.089]  I need the world to see this film.
[03:01:19.529 --> 03:01:22.670]  I need to know that when I go back and face... I'm not going to run from this.
[03:01:22.990 --> 03:01:26.793]  Well, I'm going to go to court because, as I said, Alex, I'm putting them on trial.
[03:01:27.293 --> 03:01:28.414]  They're the ones on trial here.
[03:01:28.714 --> 03:01:35.258]  As long as the world's the leading citizen journalists of the world are in my court case, as long as they're reporting on it, then we win.
[03:01:35.578 --> 03:01:37.460]  OK, no matter what, I'm in a win-win situation.
[03:01:37.780 --> 03:01:38.720]  Send me to jail, I win.
[03:01:39.141 --> 03:01:41.182]  I win because you've destroyed your credibility.
[03:01:41.442 --> 03:01:44.064]  The public now know that your court case is a fraudulent.
[03:01:44.364 --> 03:01:50.607]  The public now do not trust when you bring someone to court and you bankrupt them with either a billion pound or 1.6 million pound.
[03:01:50.807 --> 03:01:52.187]  They also done the same to Katie Hopkins.
[03:01:52.207 --> 03:01:52.888]  They took her house.
[03:01:53.228 --> 03:01:54.008]  That's what this is about.
[03:01:54.208 --> 03:01:55.509]  They're not just happy with censoring you.
[03:01:55.829 --> 03:01:56.929]  They have to destroy you.
[03:01:57.310 --> 03:01:58.610]  I tried saying this to Andrew Tate.
[03:01:58.630 --> 03:01:59.590]  They're coming for your money, bruv.
[03:01:59.610 --> 03:02:00.611]  They're going to leave you with nothing.
[03:02:01.011 --> 03:02:01.752]  That's what this is about.
[03:02:02.052 --> 03:02:02.933]  Criminal enterprise.
[03:02:03.173 --> 03:02:05.935]  The criminal enterprise bit is so they can bring in the proceeds of crime.
[03:02:06.215 --> 03:02:06.796]  That's what it is.
[03:02:07.016 --> 03:02:10.078]  They don't want you prosecuted for allegations of women.
[03:02:10.299 --> 03:02:14.602]  They want you to be a criminal enterprise because that opens the door so they can seize every penny you've got.
[03:02:14.922 --> 03:02:15.903]  That's what this is about.
[03:02:16.123 --> 03:02:16.924]  It's what they've done to me.
[03:02:17.204 --> 03:02:18.785]  They bankrupt me for 1.6 million pounds.
[03:02:19.026 --> 03:02:20.807]  The whole story, Alex, was a lie.
[03:02:21.047 --> 03:02:22.028]  It wasn't just a lie.
[03:02:22.088 --> 03:02:22.548]  No, I know.
[03:02:22.608 --> 03:02:23.269]  I've been through it.
[03:02:23.329 --> 03:02:25.251]  And that's the thing, is they think we'll give up.
[03:02:25.811 --> 03:02:26.731]  Because they take money.
[03:02:26.791 --> 03:02:28.152]  The money is just a way to fund things.
[03:02:28.192 --> 03:02:28.872]  We don't care.
[03:02:29.292 --> 03:02:30.872]  As long as the public backs us, we're going to win.
[03:02:31.252 --> 03:02:33.853]  Tommy Robinson, everybody needs to follow you on X right now.
[03:02:33.893 --> 03:02:41.055]  They need to see the film Silenced, and that is T. Robinson, New Era, and it's up on screen.
[03:02:41.115 --> 03:02:42.055]  God bless you, brother.
[03:02:42.935 --> 03:02:43.915]  Things are moving so quick.
[03:02:43.975 --> 03:02:45.236]  Join us again in the next few weeks, okay?
[03:02:46.156 --> 03:02:46.416]  All right.
[03:02:46.496 --> 03:02:47.016]  Thank you, man.
[03:02:47.116 --> 03:02:47.496]  Thank you.
[03:02:47.636 --> 03:02:48.076]  Cheers, boss.
[03:02:48.416 --> 03:02:49.097]  Keep up the good work.
[03:02:49.177 --> 03:02:49.517]  See you later.
[03:02:49.577 --> 03:02:50.117]  I'm trying, brother.
[03:02:50.137 --> 03:02:50.397]  Thank you.
[03:02:51.217 --> 03:02:51.537]  All right.
[03:02:51.757 --> 03:02:54.218]  Jay Dyer is about to take over, and I've done an hour
[03:02:55.472 --> 03:02:56.133]  Without plugging.
[03:02:56.733 --> 03:02:57.334]  And it's real simple.
[03:02:58.094 --> 03:02:59.195]  I need money to fight the enemy.
[03:02:59.575 --> 03:03:00.576]  You see them trying to take it away.
[03:03:01.357 --> 03:03:02.478]  I have great products you need.
[03:03:02.998 --> 03:03:03.859]  So make the decision.
[03:03:04.279 --> 03:03:06.661]  Go to m4warrestore.com with a big sale going on right now.
[03:03:07.141 --> 03:03:10.444]  Go to drjonesdandrills.com with all the great products they've got there.
[03:03:10.484 --> 03:03:16.309]  The nano silver products and the next level foundational energy and the rocket rest and the carbon chill and all of it.
[03:03:16.909 --> 03:03:20.210]  Make the decision, hey, I'm going to back people that are fighting hard.
[03:03:20.630 --> 03:03:21.450]  I'm going to be part of history.
[03:03:21.710 --> 03:03:24.231]  You may think buying something and getting a great product in the mail is not a big deal.
[03:03:24.371 --> 03:03:25.011]  It's huge.
[03:03:25.731 --> 03:03:27.371]  That decision changes the world.
[03:03:27.431 --> 03:03:28.932]  That's why they hate you.
[03:03:28.972 --> 03:03:29.812]  That's why they hate me.
[03:03:30.212 --> 03:03:31.732]  That's why they lied and said I had $400 million.
[03:03:32.152 --> 03:03:33.513]  Now they admit I never had any money.
[03:03:34.253 --> 03:03:36.273]  The New York Times says, well, it turns out Jones didn't have any money.
[03:03:36.533 --> 03:03:42.615]  It's all lies, folks, to make you think that I was just floating around and, you know, I don't give a crap about money.
[03:03:42.695 --> 03:03:42.835]  It's a...
[03:03:45.123 --> 03:03:49.927]  Symbol of energy I need to operate, but I care about the moral issues we're engaged in.
[03:03:49.947 --> 03:03:52.488]  So I'm asking you now to make the decision.
[03:03:52.528 --> 03:03:53.569]  That's up to you.
[03:03:54.330 --> 03:03:55.711]  It's up to you to make that decision.
[03:03:56.690 --> 03:04:06.092]  To go to DRJonesNationals.com, to go to InfoWarsTore.com, and to get the products, and to sign up for AutoShop at InfoWarsTore.com, because I need your support.
[03:04:06.152 --> 03:04:07.612]  Plus, these are amazing products.
[03:04:08.252 --> 03:04:09.353]  Take action now.
[03:04:09.433 --> 03:04:16.334]  Get the InfoWars shirt that's now shipping out with Trump Iconic 555 with Bulletproof, and we have the other great sponsors as well.
[03:04:16.934 --> 03:04:20.255]  But this is history happening now, with how many days?
[03:04:20.275 --> 03:04:21.975]  Put it on screen for the election.
[03:04:21.995 --> 03:04:22.315]  90-something?
[03:04:23.075 --> 03:04:26.156]  They got 79 days after that for the inauguration?
[03:04:27.768 --> 03:04:30.589]  I mean, we are in the zone right now.
[03:04:32.129 --> 03:04:33.029]  History is happening.
[03:04:33.069 --> 03:04:34.629]  Can we put how many days the election up on screen?
[03:04:35.990 --> 03:04:37.070]  How many days the election?
[03:04:37.750 --> 03:04:39.490]  And then everybody's looking at that.
[03:04:39.510 --> 03:04:42.491]  94 days, 9 hours, 39 minutes, 58 seconds.
[03:04:44.131 --> 03:04:47.592]  What about the 79 days after that?
[03:04:48.192 --> 03:04:49.072]  Get geared up.
[03:04:49.172 --> 03:04:49.732]  Get ready.
[03:04:49.832 --> 03:04:50.193]  Commit.
[03:04:50.213 --> 03:04:57.194]  Because if you don't support by word of mouth and prayer now, we'll never support once things get nasty.
[03:04:58.891 --> 03:04:59.831]  So thanks, the crew.
[03:04:59.891 --> 03:05:00.532]  Thanks, everybody.
[03:05:01.112 --> 03:05:03.012]  Jay Dyer, for the next 40 minutes, takes over.
[03:05:04.333 --> 03:05:06.394]  Best-selling author with Jay's analysis.
[03:05:06.414 --> 03:05:08.134]  I want to thank you all for joining us.
[03:05:08.174 --> 03:05:09.775]  I want a great interview with Tommy Robinson.
[03:05:10.135 --> 03:05:11.395]  What an incredible real person.
[03:05:11.435 --> 03:05:14.276]  The best part of my job is I get to know the real people.
[03:05:14.876 --> 03:05:16.577]  I get to know the authentic, not the fake.
[03:05:16.897 --> 03:05:18.137]  Kamala Harris is the fake.
[03:05:18.558 --> 03:05:19.478]  Joe Biden's the fake.
[03:05:20.708 --> 03:05:21.869]  Barack Obama's the fake.
[03:05:22.349 --> 03:05:23.230]  Herbert Walker Bush.
[03:05:23.810 --> 03:05:24.411]  W. Bush.
[03:05:24.731 --> 03:05:25.331]  Bill Clinton.
[03:05:25.612 --> 03:05:26.232]  Hillary Clinton.
[03:05:26.452 --> 03:05:27.013]  They're the fake.
[03:05:27.493 --> 03:05:28.834]  They get to live in the world of fake.
[03:05:29.514 --> 03:05:30.635]  I get to live in the world of real.
[03:05:30.755 --> 03:05:31.856]  And that is such a blessing.
[03:05:32.136 --> 03:05:32.877]  Jay Dyer takes over.
[03:05:34.793 --> 03:05:35.373]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:05:35.513 --> 03:05:36.873]  Glad to be here on the fourth hour.
[03:05:36.934 --> 03:05:37.614]  Always an honor.
[03:05:37.654 --> 03:05:41.735]  I want to talk about the Olympics symbolism and what nobody talked about.
[03:05:41.935 --> 03:05:48.096]  I saw very few people who delved into what the references were really going back to.
[03:05:48.256 --> 03:05:51.637]  If you watch the full Olympic sequence, it was pretty revealing.
[03:05:52.157 --> 03:05:53.978]  It goes back actually to the French Revolution.
[03:05:53.998 --> 03:06:00.059]  There was a lot of symbolism that was directly referring to the Bavarian Illuminati, the Marxist Socialists,
[03:06:00.759 --> 03:06:27.129]  And the idea of a new faith that would be given to the world and that's going to culminate in that Last Supper image that we saw we've all been subjected to Obviously a very blasphemous image, but there's a reason for this and almost nobody picked up on it They saw that it was obviously intended to be an inversion of Christianity and offensive and all that But if you go into the history of the French Revolution and the people that funded it it actually begins to make a lot more sense and I'm gonna refer again to the book that you've heard me
[03:06:27.845 --> 03:06:32.868]  Look, referred to many times in the fourth hour, which is James Billington's book, Firing the Minds of Men.
[03:06:32.908 --> 03:06:37.091]  He was the famous historian at the Library of Congress.
[03:06:37.351 --> 03:06:38.532]  So he's not a conspiracy theorist.
[03:06:38.572 --> 03:06:44.295]  In fact, he's very much a fan of the Marxist-Socialist revolutions and all revolutionary philosophy.
[03:06:44.936 --> 03:06:47.517]  And he calls it, fascinatingly, a faith.
[03:06:47.637 --> 03:06:49.959]  He says this is a new faith that was intended to be
[03:06:51.399 --> 03:06:54.601]  Passed on to the world, kind of like a gospel.
[03:06:54.641 --> 03:07:00.185]  It's an evangelical message that would be exported to the whole world, he says at the beginning of the book.
[03:07:00.665 --> 03:07:03.247]  And so he's going to chart the history of the revolution.
[03:07:03.647 --> 03:07:15.334]  And of course we know that at the time of the French Revolution, there were many occult organizations and secret societies that operated in the background that were behind the French Revolution.
[03:07:16.175 --> 03:07:18.236]  Now you might think that's conspiracy theory.
[03:07:19.580 --> 03:07:25.767]  But it's actually not, because mainline historians talk about this very openly.
[03:07:26.308 --> 03:07:30.893]  I had undergrad and grad classes that dealt with the history of the French Revolution.
[03:07:30.953 --> 03:07:39.843]  My professor, who was my history advisor, he was an expert in the French Revolution, and he talked about this candidly in many classes and made us read
[03:07:40.871 --> 03:07:43.133]  An outrageous amount of books on the French Revolution.
[03:07:43.153 --> 03:07:50.160]  I don't even care that much about the French Revolution, but I had to read more about it than I ever thought I would.
[03:07:50.320 --> 03:07:53.423]  And I guess now, looking back, I'm happy that I did because I know quite a bit about it.
[03:07:53.463 --> 03:07:59.889]  But the first character that we want to talk about is the apostle of the revolutionary religion.
[03:08:00.350 --> 03:08:04.754]  His name is Buonarroti, and he was believed to be, I think, a descendant of
[03:08:06.170 --> 03:08:09.731]  A noble Florentine family that descended from Michelangelo.
[03:08:10.231 --> 03:08:28.114]  So he had a famous lineage, but at some point he got interested in the Proto-Masonic philosophy of the 1700s and decided that rather than believing in some kind of personal god, he believed instead in a grand architect of the universe.
[03:08:28.134 --> 03:08:30.975]  And of course an architect is different from a creator.
[03:08:31.135 --> 03:08:33.395]  An architect works with pre-existing matter.
[03:08:34.162 --> 03:08:41.305]  In the biblical story, God creates ex nihilo, but an architect working with pre-existing matter is more so the idea of Greek philosophy.
[03:08:41.345 --> 03:08:55.352]  This would be what Aristotle, Plato, and the Neoplatonists taught, that reality is really just an emanation from the monad, and God is more so this immaterial force or principle, like a law of gravity or something.
[03:08:55.932 --> 03:09:02.015]  And so this is why many times the Masonic philosophy in this time led to atheism or to deism,
[03:09:03.331 --> 03:09:06.212]  And there was other strands of thought that were also influencing these characters.
[03:09:07.492 --> 03:09:25.356]  When Byzantium fell, a lot of people don't know this, but the Byzantine atheist Platonist philosopher named Plethon, his philosophy actually influenced both Spinoza, the famous Jewish philosopher and pantheist, as well as the Jacobin philosophers of the French Revolution.
[03:09:26.196 --> 03:09:30.497]  So the idea here is that because all men are supposedly equal, of course we know that
[03:09:31.312 --> 03:09:32.773]  Obviously, all things are not equal.
[03:09:32.833 --> 03:09:39.655]  Unfortunately, we live in a fallen world and some people are born with gifts and talents and biology that other people are not.
[03:09:39.815 --> 03:09:46.737]  So, there's no equality in some ultimate sense, even by nature itself.
[03:09:48.198 --> 03:09:54.900]  But the philosophy of the revolutionaries was that the source of man's problems is really in the condition of the world itself.
[03:09:55.649 --> 03:09:56.710]  We're not all equal.
[03:09:57.310 --> 03:10:01.492]  So the revolution must be a war waged on inequality.
[03:10:02.333 --> 03:10:10.417]  And so they came up with the idea of not just overturning the aristocracy or the nobility or the blue bloods, but also overturning the church as well.
[03:10:10.777 --> 03:10:16.200]  So church and state have to be destroyed to bring in an ideal rationalist utopia.
[03:10:16.906 --> 03:10:18.307]  Again, it goes back to Plato.
[03:10:18.627 --> 03:10:20.248]  Plato's referenced all throughout the book.
[03:10:20.569 --> 03:10:23.391]  I've talked about this many times that Plato was the proto-communist.
[03:10:23.851 --> 03:10:36.340]  I understand that Plato's Republic is not totally communism, but the guardian class, which is the middle tier of the three-tier of the pyramid class structure of Plato's Republic, they do share all things in common.
[03:10:36.360 --> 03:10:37.481]  So it's a proto-communism.
[03:10:38.021 --> 03:10:44.846]  And all communist socialists, Marxists, and even monopoly capitalists have referred back to Plato's Republic as their model.
[03:10:45.689 --> 03:11:07.120]  Billington himself in his book references how the early Illuminists were drawing not just from the radical philosophy of Plato, but also from the radical philosophy of the Manichaeans in their dualism and their dialectics, as well as the idea of Pythagoras.
[03:11:07.220 --> 03:11:13.944]  Because Pythagoras taught that there should be a common property held by all, and that all should be equal.
[03:11:14.582 --> 03:11:26.551]  And I believe the Pythagoreans were some of the first in the ancient world to admit women to their secret society and to their secret religion, which previous societies and philosophers had not done.
[03:11:27.611 --> 03:11:32.675]  So the purpose there, again, you can see is the idea that there is this unfairness about reality.
[03:11:33.035 --> 03:11:35.817]  And how do we overcome and combat the unfairness?
[03:11:36.338 --> 03:11:38.639]  Well, we're going to enforce fairness.
[03:11:38.940 --> 03:11:40.821]  This is the beginnings of that ideology.
[03:11:42.504 --> 03:11:49.265]  The Manichaeans had a high, just like Zoroastrians, had a high view of the principle of fire.
[03:11:50.026 --> 03:11:53.586]  Some believe that, for example, Zoroastrians might have worshipped fire.
[03:11:53.606 --> 03:11:54.827]  They had a dualistic religion.
[03:11:54.847 --> 03:11:59.547]  They might have worshipped it as the good principle of God incarnate.
[03:12:00.808 --> 03:12:12.030]  But the Illuminists who took from Zoroastrianism and Manichaeanism, they believe that this was in fact just a symbol of perpetual chaos and change.
[03:12:13.132 --> 03:12:19.696]  So they were fans of ancient philosophers like Heraclitus, who believed that all is flux.
[03:12:20.917 --> 03:12:27.481]  And since fire was always moving and always hot and always changing, it was a perfect image for the revolution.
[03:12:28.101 --> 03:12:35.065]  The revolution would be again against church and state to create an entirely new society.
[03:12:35.105 --> 03:12:37.747]  So all forms of sort of utopianism
[03:12:38.274 --> 03:12:38.735]  All right.
[03:12:50.726 --> 03:12:56.591]  Slogan to the famous Masonic French Revolutionary phrase, not just liberty, equality, fraternity, but diversity.
[03:12:56.731 --> 03:13:03.437]  Did you notice that it went liberty, equality, fraternity, and then they added diversity with the bearded lady showing up at the Last Supper?
[03:13:03.457 --> 03:13:13.927]  And it was the Last Supper because the woman who was involved in portraying herself as the Christ put on her own Instagram that it was a parody of the Last Supper.
[03:13:15.540 --> 03:13:23.668]  We're going to talk about this inner group, this inner society, and how it functions as an inner elite that runs Marxism, Socialism, and Corporatism.
[03:13:23.688 --> 03:13:26.771]  We'll talk about that when we get back on to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:13:26.791 --> 03:13:27.852]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:13:28.212 --> 03:13:31.996]  When we came out with Nitric Boost three years ago, it was a sleeper product.
[03:13:32.016 --> 03:13:32.736]  I didn't even promote it.
[03:13:32.936 --> 03:13:39.322]  But as listeners began to use it, it has become one of our top selling products because of the incredible results they get.
[03:13:39.923 --> 03:13:48.827]  If you want to give your cardiovascular system a leg up, if you want to go in and help clean out and purify your blood, ladies and gentlemen, Nitric Boost is the way to go.
[03:13:49.127 --> 03:13:52.029]  You've heard Dr. Judy Mikovits talk about how it's an amazing formula.
[03:13:52.349 --> 03:13:53.870]  This is what she's recommended to people.
[03:13:53.890 --> 03:13:56.931]  Ladies and gentlemen, it does so many great things.
[03:13:57.552 --> 03:14:00.613]  Like, but you notice what happens in the morning if you're a man.
[03:14:00.633 --> 03:14:02.454]  I feel like I'm 16 years old again.
[03:14:02.794 --> 03:14:09.660]  When I was 16, I'd already had probably, I hate to brag, so I'm not bragging, it's actually shameful, probably 150 women or more.
[03:14:09.680 --> 03:14:10.621]  It's conservative.
[03:14:10.961 --> 03:14:12.663]  Nitric Boost is simply amazing.
[03:14:12.723 --> 03:14:13.924]  It's great for women as well.

[03:14:28.143 --> 03:14:30.024]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:14:30.264 --> 03:14:31.325]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:14:31.345 --> 03:14:44.871]  We're talking about the history of revolutionary philosophy that led up to the bizarre Dionysian inverted blasphemous ceremony at the high profile ritual at the opening of the Olympics in France.
[03:14:45.611 --> 03:14:53.455]  And just like when they had the opening ceremonies at London in the 2012 Olympics, they did this history of the host nation.
[03:14:54.348 --> 03:14:59.962]  And what led up to this point where they did it and the same thing is going on with with France where they did this history.
[03:15:00.951 --> 03:15:02.913]  of the nation and how they got to where they are.
[03:15:03.593 --> 03:15:06.375]  Leading the charge, of course, 1789, 1776.
[03:15:06.675 --> 03:15:09.998]  These are two strands of revolution.
[03:15:10.018 --> 03:15:16.843]  The 1776 American branch of the revolution came from what's called the Garondins, and they were the right-wing revolutionaries.
[03:15:16.883 --> 03:15:23.888]  This is people like Lafayette and others that influenced the Founding Fathers of America who didn't want to go as far as the Jacobins.
[03:15:23.928 --> 03:15:25.209]  They believed in private property.
[03:15:25.249 --> 03:15:25.750]  They believed in
[03:15:26.849 --> 03:15:28.789]  Other elements, which not all of which are bad.
[03:15:29.290 --> 03:15:37.372]  They believe, for example, in limiting the central bank power and not allowing a private central bank to have the issuance of the currency and all that.
[03:15:37.412 --> 03:15:45.954]  They were very opposed to this model of a fiat based printing system that we eventually got in 1913.
[03:15:46.514 --> 03:15:54.936]  But I wanted to note that this isn't really controversial because I found a bunch of my old French Revolution textbooks that we use in that
[03:15:55.996 --> 03:16:00.917]  And I wanted to note, for example, in R.R.
[03:16:00.958 --> 03:16:13.961]  Palmer's—this is a very well-known history of the French Revolution, it's not a conspiracy text—it has a whole section on how the French Revolution was masterminded by elements of the Illuminati.
[03:16:15.279 --> 03:16:19.822]  And that other famous figures of the French Revolution were also part of these secret societies.
[03:16:20.302 --> 03:16:25.525]  Another famous book on the French Revolution is Owen Connolly's book, French Revolution, Napoleonic Era.
[03:16:26.145 --> 03:16:36.731]  And it includes multiple chapters about the Freemasons, the Illuminati, the Jacobins, and their Masonic Declaration of Human Rights, which they produced in the French Revolution.
[03:16:38.712 --> 03:16:39.653]  And there's many, many more.
[03:16:39.673 --> 03:16:42.794]  I mean, I can go into the Oxford history of the French Revolution.
[03:16:42.834 --> 03:16:50.619]  And the Oxford history also notes the influence of the Freemasons and the Jacobins and the Nine Sisters Lodge, on and on and on.
[03:16:50.699 --> 03:16:51.199]  And there's more.
[03:16:51.259 --> 03:16:51.960]  I can keep going.
[03:16:52.020 --> 03:16:54.381]  But the point is that this isn't a conspiracy theory.
[03:16:54.401 --> 03:16:55.922]  This is actually just basic history.
[03:16:56.242 --> 03:16:57.102]  People don't know this.
[03:16:57.763 --> 03:17:01.665]  And then when you talk about it, they think that you're, you know, some sort of crackpot or something.
[03:17:01.705 --> 03:17:03.786]  But people are just out to lunch.
[03:17:03.826 --> 03:17:04.807]  They don't know anything.
[03:17:04.847 --> 03:17:06.047]  People have been really dumbed down.
[03:17:06.087 --> 03:17:06.788]  It's kind of sad.
[03:17:08.174 --> 03:17:21.482]  But if you study the ancient philosophers and the societies and the secret groups that they created and set up, like the inner group of the Pythagoreans, for example.
[03:17:21.722 --> 03:17:28.446]  Pythagoreans had a secret society that was set up where they worshipped numbers and the Temple of Equality, they called it.
[03:17:28.466 --> 03:17:34.029]  They came up with this idea of the Temple of Equality and that reason, math, and geometry could rule all things.
[03:17:35.060 --> 03:17:39.344]  And so Pythagoras is actually the first real principled Illuminist.
[03:17:39.384 --> 03:17:43.167]  You could say Plato or even ancient religions perhaps.
[03:17:44.268 --> 03:17:49.773]  But they didn't really favor this communist idea and Pythagoras more so even than Plato.
[03:17:49.933 --> 03:17:54.297]  Pythagoras in fact was a radical communist and he influenced people like
[03:17:55.729 --> 03:18:11.737]  Revolutionaries like Bonneville, Thomas Paine was actually influenced by Pythagoreanism and Masonic philosophy such that Thomas Paine believed that the Druids and the Pythagoreans had created a secret occult alternative to Christianity that one could join.
[03:18:11.837 --> 03:18:22.863]  So this is the mythology of the secret societies that they've had this ancient lineage and if you join this ancient lineage you're getting the real true secret religion or the real true secret mysteries and the secret is what?
[03:18:23.464 --> 03:18:26.825]  We will decapitate the double-headed eagle and take it over.
[03:18:27.065 --> 03:18:30.287]  This is the later Masonic philosophers talking about the double-headed eagle.
[03:18:31.887 --> 03:18:40.891]  In the time of Christianity, the Byzantine Empire, the Roman Empire, etc., the double-headed eagle ends up symbolizing church and state, the two heads, church and state, working in harmony.
[03:18:40.911 --> 03:18:42.592]  It wasn't originally a Masonic symbol.
[03:18:42.612 --> 03:18:50.355]  It gets co-opted by Freemasonry to be a Masonic symbol in the 1700s with the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry.
[03:18:51.818 --> 03:19:02.524]  They took the doctrine of the Trinity, many of these Freemasonic revolutionaries in the 1790s, and they turned it into a principle of math and triangulation in the world.
[03:19:02.564 --> 03:19:10.749]  So they took the Trinity, the doctrine of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and said, oh, that's just math, and that's just the mathematical principles of geometry operating in the world.
[03:19:11.209 --> 03:19:15.272]  The state then should ultimately be a mathematics-based state
[03:19:15.851 --> 03:19:29.702]  This is the teaching of the Philadelphians, and I think we talked about that in one of the lectures the other day from the Cambridge Companion, because the Philadelphians were influenced by Jacob Boehm and other process philosophy people who influenced Hegel and Marxists and others.
[03:19:30.142 --> 03:19:38.769]  So the idea really is that all revolutionary philosophy is culminating in some kind of new man, some kind of new world, new church.
[03:19:39.510 --> 03:19:43.113]  And Billington, again, as a historian of
[03:19:44.053 --> 03:19:46.495]  Revolutionary thought calls it the new church.
[03:19:46.575 --> 03:19:52.941]  He says you can compare the rise of socialism, Marxism, to a new church.
[03:19:54.463 --> 03:19:58.006]  Now don't misunderstand what I'm saying because a lot of people will say that this is all a battle of
[03:19:59.072 --> 03:20:02.413]  Uh, communists versus, uh, true capitalists.
[03:20:03.013 --> 03:20:06.914]  No, the monopoly capitalists have always funded the Marxist socialists.
[03:20:07.194 --> 03:20:08.034]  That's always been the case.
[03:20:08.054 --> 03:20:20.416]  In fact, Quigley says in his chapter on France that the French Revolution was funded by Protestant banking interests and other banking interests throughout the European banking houses.
[03:20:20.456 --> 03:20:21.477]  You can guess what I mean.
[03:20:21.837 --> 03:20:22.737]  That's what Quigley says.
[03:20:23.277 --> 03:20:24.637]  So, what did they teach?
[03:20:24.657 --> 03:20:27.098]  They taught dialectical materialism.
[03:20:27.318 --> 03:20:28.258]  This influenced Marx.
[03:20:29.281 --> 03:20:44.908]  And this, for Marx, was derived from Saint-Simon, the French socialist, Feuerbach, and Hegel, and then Marx took that and turned it into his philosophy, which then influences a giant portion of the world.
[03:20:44.928 --> 03:20:47.749]  And what does Marxism say in its ten planks?
[03:20:48.849 --> 03:20:57.013]  Well, it's anti-religion, obviously, but it also says that you need a central bank that controls the issuance of currency.
[03:20:57.899 --> 03:21:01.061]  And that central bank, of course, ends up being a private central bank.
[03:21:01.201 --> 03:21:03.062]  Perhaps Marx didn't want a private bank.
[03:21:03.102 --> 03:21:07.565]  Maybe he thought it should be something that is an international entity.
[03:21:07.605 --> 03:21:07.945]  I don't know.
[03:21:08.005 --> 03:21:12.127]  But we all know that, again, Marxism was propped up by capital.
[03:21:12.668 --> 03:21:19.692]  Marx couldn't have done anything without the monetary support of Engels operating in the background to give him the funding that he had.
[03:21:20.777 --> 03:21:22.598]  What is the goal of all of this ultimately?
[03:21:23.038 --> 03:21:35.923]  Well, many of the later socialists after the 1700s got more radical and said it's time to recognize the equality, equalitarian principles, not just in economics or in social order, but in gender.
[03:21:36.904 --> 03:21:47.228]  And so you got a bunch of Marxists and the socialists in the 1800s, in the 1900s, who thought that they could create a new utopia only through
[03:21:48.180 --> 03:21:49.341]  The rise of feminism.
[03:21:49.701 --> 03:21:54.404]  So there's a direct connection between the rise of Marxism-Socialism and feminism.
[03:21:54.704 --> 03:21:57.766]  It immediately follows the rise of Marxism.
[03:21:59.307 --> 03:22:02.508]  The famous French revolutionary thinker.
[03:22:04.290 --> 03:22:05.110]  Well, she wasn't French.
[03:22:05.150 --> 03:22:06.251]  I think she might have been French.
[03:22:06.271 --> 03:22:06.651]  I'm not sure.
[03:22:06.691 --> 03:22:07.331]  But yeah, she was.
[03:22:08.132 --> 03:22:09.212]  Mary Wollstonecraft.
[03:22:11.574 --> 03:22:16.857]  She wrote the first feminist treatise at the time of the revolution.
[03:22:17.754 --> 03:22:24.820]  And she becomes an image and a symbol for female revolution and women's liberation.
[03:22:25.561 --> 03:22:28.403]  After her, a bunch of people followed, who also followed St.
[03:22:28.463 --> 03:22:43.196]  Simone, and believed in the abolition of marriage, fully open polycule relationships, and some of them even believed in a coming female messiah, one of whom was named Flora Tristan, the coming female messiah who believed that she was the female principle of the Trinity.
[03:22:45.064 --> 03:22:48.806]  Much of other female messiahs who all had weird delusions also followed after her.
[03:22:49.166 --> 03:22:51.407]  People don't tell you that this is the real origin of feminism.
[03:22:51.467 --> 03:22:56.310]  Feminism comes from these like lunatic people who thought that they were female versions of Jesus.
[03:22:57.791 --> 03:23:10.119]  And this is not accidental that in the French Revolutionary homage that the Olympics did, they had a fat, I think she's Jewish, lesbian play the role of Christ.
[03:23:10.399 --> 03:23:17.084]  That's all intentional inversion, but it's actually the history of the French Revolutionary and Socialist Revolutionary women.
[03:23:17.604 --> 03:23:25.289]  Another one was Fanny Wright, and she was interesting because she was the first androgynous non-binary woman in the modern world.
[03:23:26.010 --> 03:23:27.911]  Fannie Wright, the B-R-I-G-H-T.
[03:23:29.212 --> 03:23:39.600]  She believed in social justice, she believed in equalizing everything for the oppressed, and that there should never be any other people group, nation, state, ethnicity, or race.
[03:23:39.840 --> 03:23:42.422]  Everything should become one giant blended thing.
[03:23:44.343 --> 03:23:48.686]  And she was the first non-binary pusher of modern times, Fannie Wright.
[03:23:49.147 --> 03:23:50.708]  She was also a socialist utopian.
[03:23:51.630 --> 03:23:56.393]  She believed that she was another savior next to the previous saviors who had come like Christ.
[03:23:56.434 --> 03:24:00.657]  So, understand this is the mainline history of the French Revolution.
[03:24:00.897 --> 03:24:03.639]  Billington has a whole chapter on the role of women in feminism.
[03:24:06.281 --> 03:24:13.586]  This is why when you get to the Bolshevik Revolution, Alexandra Kolontai becomes one of the most important Bolshevik leaders.
[03:24:14.026 --> 03:24:17.889]  She abolishes all marriage, all laws about
[03:24:18.792 --> 03:24:19.352]  We're good to go.
[03:24:48.522 --> 03:24:56.788]  There is an intentional subversion and destruction, and that's what's done to these countries in these revolutions, and it's what's happening to our country right now.
[03:24:56.808 --> 03:25:03.353]  In fact, many Orthodox saints who lived through the bullshit revolution and were put to death said that this would come to America.
[03:25:03.734 --> 03:25:11.620]  So they actually predicted that the bullshit revolution would not end, it would eventually move on to the West, and it would take place in the United States.
[03:25:12.180 --> 03:25:15.961]  And they were pushing all the same radical gender things that you see now.
[03:25:16.561 --> 03:25:26.524]  So this demonic spirit doesn't go away, it just reappears, pushes the same stuff, it eventually collapses and goes away, and then it's allowed into some other place.
[03:25:27.224 --> 03:25:31.865]  And it's allowed because the people lose their discernment and their connection to God.
[03:25:32.614 --> 03:25:37.457]  They fall into all the same traps and tricks that the other previous nations fell into.
[03:25:37.577 --> 03:25:38.658]  It's not just monetary.
[03:25:38.678 --> 03:25:47.044]  I mean, the central bank stuff is important, but they also fall prey to giving up their connection to God and their religious worship and principle.
[03:25:47.424 --> 03:25:58.852]  They give away that heritage, that lineage, and then they're left with other things that don't give man meaning and purpose, and then man becomes a tool to the corporate and money power.
[03:26:00.440 --> 03:26:02.202]  So I want to go to the Olympics.
[03:26:02.663 --> 03:26:07.708]  If we look at the opening ceremony of the Olympics, what we saw is actually the history of France.
[03:26:08.429 --> 03:26:11.973]  And it begins with, as we said, this comedian who's a famous French comedian.
[03:26:12.013 --> 03:26:16.077]  I didn't know who this was, but he takes the torch, the Torch of Liberty.
[03:26:16.197 --> 03:26:20.341]  This is the Liberty Torch that you see the Statue of Liberty carrying.
[03:26:20.402 --> 03:26:21.543]  It's Columbia, the goddess.
[03:26:23.539 --> 03:26:29.363]  And he runs the torch to an empty stadium and he makes a big mistake and it's supposed to be funny because he went to the wrong place.
[03:26:29.803 --> 03:26:32.124]  So there's not going to be time to get it to the ceremony.
[03:26:32.164 --> 03:26:35.806]  So they hand the torch over to a kid.
[03:26:35.846 --> 03:26:40.029]  He looks like he's a Muslim kid with two French girlfriends, two young French girlfriends.
[03:26:40.089 --> 03:26:45.352]  And he runs and takes the torch because he's the future of France and gives it to Charon.
[03:26:45.952 --> 03:26:46.833]  Charon is the
[03:26:47.951 --> 03:26:51.232]  Uh, character from Greek mythology who takes you across the river Styx.
[03:26:51.592 --> 03:26:53.152]  So they literally go into the catacombs.
[03:26:53.232 --> 03:26:55.933]  There's this faceless Charon creature down there.
[03:26:57.814 --> 03:27:03.875]  He takes the torch, uh, the kids taking the torch to the ceremonies which are occurring there on the river.
[03:27:05.096 --> 03:27:10.217]  And, uh, this is what's called in literature, a catabasis.
[03:27:10.237 --> 03:27:14.538]  So there's this weird descent into the underworld with the flame of liberty.
[03:27:15.382 --> 03:27:22.147]  It then comes out later on with the performance of Lady Gaga doing some kind of weird cabaret thing.
[03:27:22.167 --> 03:27:23.708]  I don't know what the point of that was.
[03:27:23.788 --> 03:27:29.531]  But then it turns into a history of France up to the French Revolution.
[03:27:30.432 --> 03:27:38.817]  And they basically skip everything in history all the way up until the point where Marie Antoinette is beheaded.
[03:27:39.538 --> 03:27:44.001]  She starts singing as a beheaded, bloody member of the royalty.
[03:27:45.084 --> 03:27:49.127]  And a bunch of blood pops out of the windows of a palace there on the river.
[03:27:50.487 --> 03:27:59.993]  And this is supposed to be celebrating and signifying, yeah, there it is, celebrating and signifying the French Revolution, which was, again, done at the behest of these bloodthirsty Jacobins.
[03:28:00.653 --> 03:28:06.597]  And the Committee for Public Safety actually, they actually killed
[03:28:07.683 --> 03:28:13.830]  It's reported to be 20,000 people they beheaded, particularly amongst the nobility because they were bourgeoisie.
[03:28:13.850 --> 03:28:21.719]  And then of course what always happens is that the revolutionaries turn on each other and they start beheading each other because they're not revolutionary enough.
[03:28:22.840 --> 03:28:25.884]  Because what happens is, in these weird obsessions with equality,
[03:28:26.542 --> 03:28:34.850]  Just like you see nowadays with cancel culture, they all turn on each other because, oh wait a minute, you're actually higher on the oppression totem pole than we are.
[03:28:35.330 --> 03:28:45.300]  There was actually journalists in the French Revolution who would get each other killed because they would say, hey wait a minute, you know, Babouf over there or whoever, that journalist, he's fat.
[03:28:45.820 --> 03:28:52.405]  He couldn't be fat unless he had a lot of food and he was part of the bourgeoisie, and then the bloodthirsty Antifa crowd would go and kill that guy.
[03:28:52.685 --> 03:29:03.574]  And they would literally open up the Bastille, or the prison or whatever it was, and let all of the, with the equivalent of Antifa, they would let the criminals out to just go and be the revolutionaries.
[03:29:04.034 --> 03:29:08.778]  So literally the same game plan of the French Revolution is what they do in all of these countries.
[03:29:08.838 --> 03:29:11.019]  Same thing that they did in Russia in early 1900s, 1917.
[03:29:16.937 --> 03:29:28.060]  And then we get the gay and trans dancings that occur during the sections when they're promoting liberty, equality, fraternity.
[03:29:28.100 --> 03:29:29.760]  We get three gay dudes dancing together.
[03:29:29.800 --> 03:29:33.381]  So finally, they can have a gay polycule because of liberty.
[03:29:33.421 --> 03:29:34.381]  That's what liberty means.
[03:29:34.401 --> 03:29:36.922]  It's just whatever you want to put in your butt is the essence of liberty.
[03:29:37.897 --> 03:29:45.099]  Then we get this weird divergence over where Charon, who's carrying the torch, runs through a movie screen.
[03:29:45.679 --> 03:29:56.942]  So he steps into the domain of cinema, and I guess this is supposed to be an homage to the elements of French cinema and how important France is to the history of movies and cinema.
[03:29:57.902 --> 03:30:06.364]  But the weird part about that is that it's really just, there's the blood popping, that's celebrating the blood of the French Revolution, beheading all of the upper class.
[03:30:07.163 --> 03:30:10.266]  And anyone who was deemed to be part of the upper class, right?
[03:30:10.286 --> 03:30:13.049]  So this is like another celebration of like Maoism, right?
[03:30:13.129 --> 03:30:14.350]  Basically, same idea, right?
[03:30:14.410 --> 03:30:17.153]  Anybody who, oh, you studied at the university?
[03:30:17.193 --> 03:30:21.397]  Well, you're part of the bourgeoisie because you couldn't do that unless you had money, right?
[03:30:23.359 --> 03:30:31.487]  But all of this push for equality is really just a demonic capitulation to envy.
[03:30:32.381 --> 03:30:43.209]  Because it's a bunch of criminals who, even if the upper class is corrupt, which I'm sure the upper class is usually corrupt, sure, but that doesn't mean that the criminals who want to kill them are the good guys.
[03:30:43.730 --> 03:30:50.795]  But everybody thinks in dialectics and so they assume that, oh, well then the revolutionaries must be the good guys and the upper class must be the bad guys.
[03:30:51.355 --> 03:31:00.022]  But that's really none of this is at all like Christian theism or Christian morality because we don't think that being a part of a class necessarily makes you good or evil.
[03:31:01.044 --> 03:31:05.246]  There is a structure and an order to the world, and there's nothing inherently wrong with structure and order.
[03:31:06.166 --> 03:31:11.088]  And a lot of times when we get the bloody revolutions, it's worse than what you had before.
[03:31:11.668 --> 03:31:20.412]  Because the communists, the socialists, the Marxists, the revolutionaries, who are funded by the banking elite and the monopoly capitalists, by the way, they're not actually anti-capitalist.
[03:31:20.732 --> 03:31:25.354]  If you read the Rakowski interrogation, he makes that point as a committed high-level Trotskyite.
[03:31:25.394 --> 03:31:26.835]  He says that we're not against capitalism.
[03:31:27.255 --> 03:31:28.795]  Capitalism is part of the dialectic.
[03:31:28.835 --> 03:31:29.296]  It's necessary.
[03:31:29.316 --> 03:31:30.196]  It funds the revolution.
[03:31:32.200 --> 03:31:41.082]  You get the return then, after the cinema sequence, to French rappers.
[03:31:41.122 --> 03:31:45.223]  Of course, yes, we all know about, when we think of France, you think of rappers, of course.
[03:31:45.783 --> 03:31:56.086]  Then we get a story about Jean Baret, this woman who disguised herself as a man, this is sort of a quasi-trans reference, to be the first woman to sail across the oceans.
[03:31:57.546 --> 03:32:01.407]  But the only reason they chose her is because it's a feminist and trans icon.
[03:32:02.216 --> 03:32:12.024]  And then we get The Last Supper, as we mentioned, which is actually Leonardo da Vinci's painting, but then it's a catwalk.
[03:32:12.224 --> 03:32:19.570]  And if you watch the full sequence, what they're sitting there at The Last Supper doing, I guess she's a DJ at The Last Supper?
[03:32:19.590 --> 03:32:23.693]  And they also have a kid there, which suggests pedo stuff, right?
[03:32:23.713 --> 03:32:27.957]  So it's not just transvestites and weirdos, it's also suggesting pedo stuff.
[03:32:27.997 --> 03:32:30.719]  Then it turns into a catwalk with a bearded lady.
[03:32:31.787 --> 03:32:35.129]  And that is, again, Baphomet imagery.
[03:32:35.749 --> 03:32:48.114]  So they've inverted The Last Supper and, you know, Christ instituting the Eucharist, and they turned it into a bearded Baphomet imagery where a bearded woman pop star dances.
[03:32:48.134 --> 03:32:49.495]  I don't even know, is that a man or a woman?
[03:32:49.515 --> 03:32:50.175]  I don't know what it is.
[03:32:50.255 --> 03:33:01.080]  But that was intentionally inversion to signify that the religion of the future is this kind of goddess party worship, this hedonism, this indulgence
[03:33:02.132 --> 03:33:07.336]  Uh, there's the catwalk, you see, where they're having the Lord's Supper and it turns into a DJ party.
[03:33:07.916 --> 03:33:09.177]  And then you get all these gay guys.
[03:33:09.478 --> 03:33:14.461]  And so this is the religion of the future is what you see in something like Brave New World.
[03:33:15.202 --> 03:33:22.007]  If you remember in Brave New World, Huxley said that there will be a religion of the future in the technocratic era, but it will be one based around
[03:33:22.771 --> 03:33:23.312]  We're good to go.
[03:33:45.114 --> 03:33:54.477]  Essentially, this is all no religion because the girl that you saw on the raft singing, I think that was her, she was singing the John Lennon song, you know.
[03:33:56.778 --> 03:33:58.719]  No, I forget how all the words go.
[03:33:58.739 --> 03:34:03.640]  But actually, if you read the words to that song, it actually sounds like a satire.
[03:34:03.700 --> 03:34:06.661]  He's actually, sounds like he's actually satirizing communism.
[03:34:06.701 --> 03:34:10.323]  I didn't, this is just a theory I have because I heard the song recently.
[03:34:10.343 --> 03:34:14.444]  And I was listening to the words, which I've always assumed were like a Marxist
[03:34:16.816 --> 03:34:23.602]  But if you listen to it, he actually sounds like he's critiquing and pointing out how absurd Marxism is.
[03:34:23.782 --> 03:34:35.352]  And that actually makes sense if you know more about John Lennon, because he was beginning towards the end of his life to speak out more and more against Marxism, socialism, and eugenics and depopulation.
[03:34:35.932 --> 03:34:41.858]  If you recall, he's on that one talk show, that British talk show, and the talk show host says, you know,
[03:34:42.862 --> 03:34:43.743]  What's really going on?
[03:34:43.763 --> 03:34:44.443]  What's your views?
[03:34:44.983 --> 03:34:45.484]  It's Luna, man.
[03:34:45.504 --> 03:34:46.604]  They're going to kill us all.
[03:34:46.624 --> 03:34:48.206]  They want to kill the whole world.
[03:34:48.746 --> 03:34:49.927]  It's a depopulation, mate.
[03:34:50.267 --> 03:34:53.129]  He actually says that it's a eugenics plan to depopulate the world.
[03:34:53.149 --> 03:34:56.431]  So it seems like he might have been catching on to what was really going on.
[03:34:56.911 --> 03:35:00.613]  And maybe he wasn't arguing for some sort of atheistic perspective.
[03:35:00.653 --> 03:35:00.994]  I don't know.
[03:35:01.194 --> 03:35:01.894]  I could be wrong about that.
[03:35:01.934 --> 03:35:06.577]  But then, oddly enough, it shifts to Joan of Arc.
[03:35:07.338 --> 03:35:09.219]  And I could understand why.
[03:35:09.259 --> 03:35:12.201]  That's the woman on that metal horse that you saw riding across the water.
[03:35:13.166 --> 03:35:20.273]  A lot of people thought this was the book of the apocalypse, the pale horse, the rider that's death.
[03:35:21.274 --> 03:35:33.026]  It could be both, because if Joan of Arc is supposed to be a symbol of feminism, which is what I think they were using her for, and then they turned her into a robotic image of Joan of Arc, it's sort of like
[03:35:33.661 --> 03:35:36.742]  A feminist icon that's bringing a technocratic era.
[03:35:36.862 --> 03:35:38.142]  It's just very, very bizarre.
[03:35:38.162 --> 03:35:42.463]  I don't know why you would make Joan of Arc into a robot and give her a robot horse.
[03:35:42.643 --> 03:35:46.803]  But that's essentially what the meaning of that woman riding the horse was.
[03:35:46.963 --> 03:35:48.604]  But it also could be a double sense.
[03:35:48.624 --> 03:35:51.384]  There could be a double sense to the symbolism.
[03:35:51.404 --> 03:35:51.884]  Yeah, there it is.
[03:35:51.904 --> 03:35:54.365]  That's supposed to be Joan of Arc, which is kind of ridiculous.
[03:35:54.465 --> 03:36:02.826]  But the only reason they put her in there was because, oh, well, you see, you could read her as an image of
[03:36:03.792 --> 03:36:04.073]  All right.
[03:36:14.662 --> 03:36:19.704]  The fourth thing that they added to Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, and that's diversity.
[03:36:20.224 --> 03:36:22.885]  So Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, and now diversity.
[03:36:22.925 --> 03:36:33.508]  So the Masonic dictum has now turned into the New World Order occult dictum of trans and non-binary, and that Baphomet imagery
[03:36:34.108 --> 03:36:36.570]  It's absolutely 100% intentional and satanic.
[03:36:36.770 --> 03:36:37.650]  It should be obvious.
[03:36:38.071 --> 03:36:47.196]  And all the people who are walking it back, who were involved in this, were literally putting on their social media before this that, no, it's intentionally supposed to be a lampooning of the Lord's Supper.
[03:36:47.637 --> 03:36:49.858]  Well, they're telling you what the new religion is.
[03:36:50.858 --> 03:36:55.161]  Just think about the Gotthard Tunnel Ceremony, what, about 10 years ago?
[03:36:55.782 --> 03:36:57.543]  If you watched that ceremony, it was the same thing.
[03:36:57.563 --> 03:37:02.846]  You had all these EU politicians there for this giant tunnel that they'd built underneath this mountain.
[03:37:03.815 --> 03:37:05.175]  I think for a railway.
[03:37:06.076 --> 03:37:13.878]  And the Gothard Tunnel blew everybody away because it's like, well, what does this building a tunnel have to do with a giant satanic ceremony?
[03:37:15.039 --> 03:37:20.080]  And they did this performance art where the workers come out in these these orange jumpsuits.
[03:37:20.400 --> 03:37:21.461]  They always have the workers.
[03:37:21.901 --> 03:37:22.501]  Yeah, here it is.
[03:37:23.321 --> 03:37:24.962]  And the workers come out in orange jumpsuits.
[03:37:25.936 --> 03:37:35.912]  And then they dig the tunnel, and in front of them is this, there's the workers, this Baphomet guy who's got a, well, he's more like Pan, I should say.
[03:37:35.952 --> 03:37:38.596]  He's a goat-headed guy dancing around.
[03:37:38.616 --> 03:37:41.120]  There's a giant evil baby cherub.
[03:37:42.464 --> 03:37:43.744]  Demonic cherub flying around.
[03:37:43.804 --> 03:37:46.625]  And by the way, he has BDSM stuff going on, too.
[03:37:47.365 --> 03:37:48.065]  Of course, right?
[03:37:48.085 --> 03:37:53.546]  Because that's when you think of workers in the working class, you think of like bondage gear, right?
[03:37:53.606 --> 03:37:55.406]  Maybe that's how the elite think of the working class.
[03:37:55.426 --> 03:37:55.727]  I don't know.
[03:37:55.747 --> 03:37:58.727]  But this whole thing was like a satanic ceremony.
[03:37:58.767 --> 03:38:02.348]  And then you had this pan character dancing around.
[03:38:02.408 --> 03:38:09.049]  And then when they go outside towards the end of the ritual, there's a giant all seeing eye that's projected onto a screen.
[03:38:10.363 --> 03:38:12.685]  And they all dance around the goat-headed guy.
[03:38:13.385 --> 03:38:16.308]  So that's an intentional high-profile ritual.
[03:38:16.328 --> 03:38:20.331]  They're showing you what the elite actually believe, which is the satanic philosophy.
[03:38:20.831 --> 03:38:28.096]  They once again rolled out a giant worldwide high-profile ritual, the satanic imagery, at the Paris Olympics.
[03:38:28.737 --> 03:38:36.042]  We've been talking about this going all the way back to the, you know, Super Bowl halftime show when they were pushing this stuff 15, 20 years ago.
[03:38:37.518 --> 03:38:39.139]  So, we've been right.
[03:38:39.179 --> 03:38:40.320]  We've been vindicated once again.
[03:38:40.360 --> 03:38:41.020]  They did it for you.
[03:38:41.140 --> 03:38:41.860]  All in your face.
[03:38:42.080 --> 03:38:42.841]  Throw it in your face.
[03:38:42.861 --> 03:38:48.184]  I want to remind everybody that you can go get tickets to the Cognitive Liberty Conference in two weeks in Nashville.
[03:38:48.204 --> 03:38:51.325]  I'll be speaking there with Dr. James Lindsay, Courtney Turner, and others.
[03:38:51.345 --> 03:38:54.127]  You can get my books at Jay's Analysis in the shop.
[03:38:54.207 --> 03:38:54.847]  Sign copies.
[03:38:56.128 --> 03:38:59.629]  And you also support Alex by going to the Infowars store and getting those products.
[03:38:59.950 --> 03:39:03.952]  So, number one, you've got central banks now starting to buy it.
[03:39:04.252 --> 03:39:05.673]  By the tons, right?
[03:39:05.813 --> 03:39:06.293]  It's a lot.
[03:39:07.060 --> 03:39:13.705]  You've now got Chinese citizens being encouraged to not just buy gold, but buy silver.
[03:39:14.386 --> 03:39:19.390]  Because China and Russia want to destroy the Western banks.
[03:39:19.930 --> 03:39:28.057]  And the Western banks, JP Morgan Chase and HSBC, have the largest number of naked short positions on the planet.
[03:39:28.923 --> 03:39:29.543]  On the planet.
[03:39:29.583 --> 03:39:36.688]  I think between the two of them, they have over 900 million ounces of silver in short position.
[03:39:36.728 --> 03:39:40.370]  Well, only 1.2 billion ounces of silver is mined every year globally.
[03:39:40.710 --> 03:39:44.412]  So they've got almost the entire annual production in a short position.
[03:39:44.952 --> 03:39:51.216]  That means when the price goes up, these banks lose money hand over fist in multiples.
[03:39:51.776 --> 03:40:01.121]  China knows this, which is why they're encouraging all of their citizens now to buy not just gold, but buy silver, because that creates more demand.
[03:40:01.481 --> 03:40:08.125]  Every time silver goes up in price, the Western banks lose money in multiples, because they're on the wrong side of the transaction.
[03:40:08.880 --> 03:40:12.861]  They want to do it to destroy the West, and they want to do it to make a financial gain.
[03:40:13.301 --> 03:40:18.102]  Both of those, in their minds, are legitimate enough reasons to do something, right?
[03:40:18.142 --> 03:40:24.423]  But let's look at silver, because that's what we're allocated into right now, because the ratio between gold and silver points towards silver.
[03:40:24.463 --> 03:40:25.324]  It's outperforming.
[03:40:26.084 --> 03:40:28.384]  Where were we just four years ago?
[03:40:29.485 --> 03:40:28.384]  $11.91.
[03:40:30.785 --> 03:40:33.285]  But now since then, we've gone from $11.91 to almost $30.
[03:40:36.565 --> 03:40:36.805]  I think?
[03:40:52.483 --> 03:41:02.146]  These unified ledgers and these social credit scoring systems and this digital money, you're getting something tangible that actually doesn't just grow.
[03:41:02.206 --> 03:41:03.126]  It's growing tremendously.
[03:41:03.146 --> 03:41:04.626]  It's up like 40% in four months.
[03:41:04.646 --> 03:41:05.367]  That's amazing.
[03:41:05.847 --> 03:41:08.908]  But you also have something that can maintain your freedoms, Alex.
[03:41:08.968 --> 03:41:13.869]  That's the tangible intangible, which is as our freedoms are eroded.
[03:41:13.909 --> 03:41:17.870]  I can't believe we have millions of viewers right now and maybe 500 people call you.
[03:41:18.390 --> 03:41:19.130]  It's a sponsor.
[03:41:19.150 --> 03:41:20.771]  I want to promote what I think is great.
[03:41:21.571 --> 03:41:28.135]  So I sell water filtration systems that have the highest rating for like half the price on average, and I sell high quality supplements.
[03:41:28.236 --> 03:41:29.596]  I just sell stuff that I think is great.
[03:41:30.137 --> 03:41:33.219]  Everybody should call you and get into silver and gold right now.
[03:41:33.599 --> 03:41:35.420]  There's nothing performing as good as it.
[03:41:35.941 --> 03:41:38.042]  I mean, it's like it's like it's on record.
[03:41:38.082 --> 03:41:40.784]  It's the best investment, but the stockbrokers won't tell you that.
[03:41:41.004 --> 03:41:44.548]  The globalist argument is, oh, the world's in turmoil and everything's collapsing.
[03:41:44.568 --> 03:41:45.669]  We've got to be strong.
[03:41:46.130 --> 03:41:48.833]  And America's going to threaten Russia and China to keep us as the dollar.
[03:41:49.133 --> 03:41:51.115]  But they're the ones that undermine the currency.
[03:41:51.155 --> 03:41:53.798]  They're the ones that brought us into this situation.
[03:41:54.559 --> 03:41:56.541]  And so that's why this is so incredibly dangerous.
[03:41:56.561 --> 03:41:57.682]  This is trying to kill Trump.
[03:41:58.263 --> 03:42:00.024]  Just, what, 10-11 days ago.
[03:42:00.444 --> 03:42:02.625]  They are going for broke.
[03:42:02.725 --> 03:42:05.027]  I wish we weren't in this position, but we are.
[03:42:05.107 --> 03:42:10.910]  But by admitting where we are, we have a real chance of waking up, like Congress saying, we know you tried to kill Trump.
[03:42:11.210 --> 03:42:13.631]  Buying silver is the smartest bet there is.
[03:42:13.651 --> 03:42:16.252]  If you'd have bought silver a year ago, up 20-30%.
[03:42:16.272 --> 03:42:21.955]  That's what you want, and silver is the big mover in this economy.
[03:42:22.255 --> 03:42:23.136]  So, go now.
[03:42:23.596 --> 03:42:28.717]  The KEPM.com forward slash gold or 720-605-3900 will explain it all to you.
[03:42:28.757 --> 03:42:36.579]  Most of the gold and silver companies are charging you huge 30, 40, 50 percent premiums and most of the conservative talk show hosts are doing it too.
[03:42:36.879 --> 03:42:38.840]  And I talked to a person, I said, you need Kirk Elliott.
[03:42:39.240 --> 03:42:42.681]  What does Goldman Sachs think gold is going to do before the end of the year?
[03:42:43.661 --> 03:42:45.222]  $2,700 an ounce.
[03:42:45.622 --> 03:42:51.284]  And I'm sitting here saying, it funds us, it keeps us on air, and it's the best investment hands down in Imperfect World.
[03:42:51.324 --> 03:42:56.426]  I mean, this is, to me, is one of the most important things to protect your financial future ever.
[03:42:56.606 --> 03:42:59.487]  Go now to KEPM.com forward slash gold.
