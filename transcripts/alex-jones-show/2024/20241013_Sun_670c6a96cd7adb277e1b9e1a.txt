[00:00:02.809 --> 00:00:05.009]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.250]  I am your host this evening, Chase Geyser.
[00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:12.470]  But just in five minutes from this very moment, we are going to hear an outstanding interview between Dr.
[00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.189]  Drew and Alex Jones.
[00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.449]  It's going to play for about an hour, then we're going to cover the news.
[00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.010]  Groundbreaking news for a couple of hours, and then a final hour of the broadcast tonight between 7 p.m.
[00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.550]  Central Time and 8 p.m.
[00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:29.149]  Central Time. We will be taking your calls, so please keep your phones nearby.
[00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:37.850]  Apparently, a third Trump assassination attempt was thwarted when armed man arrested outside Coachella Rally, Sheriff says.
[00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.530]  This was a story that broke on the New York Post.
[00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.070]  Drew Hernandez did a great job of breaking this on Twitter as well.
[00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.329]  Which is where it first came to our attention.
[00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.229]  Now, the only thing that bothers me about this headline, of course, is that I think this was actually the fourth attempt.
[00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.390]  At least the fourth attempt, because everyone seems to forget about what happened in Tucson.
[00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:13.329]  With the rally where 20 people had to seek medical care sitting right behind Trump on stage for what appeared to be some sort of a chemical attack or a laser attack, basically blinding several of them, some of them severely, some of them even perhaps permanently.
[00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:22.150]  Trump, fortunately, was not affected, but it does seem like there was some sort of specific attempt to harm the president at the Tucson rally, which I think counted as the third.
[00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:29.290]  But now we have this fourth attempt, or what the officials are going to refer to as the third attempt, outside of Coachella.
[00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:40.049]  I'm told, based on some of the reports that I see, we're waiting for more details to come in, as the story, of course, just broke today, that this person had a high-capacity magazine, which, of course, would be illegal in the state of California.
[00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.150]  I lived in California for several years.
[00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:44.609]  Unfortunately, it was a dark time in my life.
[00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.310]  And I specifically remember having to abandon my high-capacity, high-capacity magazines for my Glock 19.
[00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.709]  And get 10 round magazines because that was the law at the time.
[00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.790]  I'm not sure if the law has changed or if the Supreme Court has successfully overturned that.
[00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.150]  There were cases that were going up to the Supreme Court when I lived there and then you'd hear one thing one week and another thing another week.
[00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:07.189]  So I'm not sure what the law is today.
[00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:18.550]  But I will say that a high capacity magazine is not something that one may come by very often in California regardless of what the law is today because of what the law has been for so many years up until this point.
[00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:47.259]  And it seems like between the Ryan Rouths And the Thomas Crookses and the Lee Harvey Oswalds and others, and this gentleman right here, I assume gentlemen, that there is an MKUltra psychological operation being conducted right before our eyes where the deep state hopes that they can trigger any number of random lunatics throughout the United States of America to behave in a reckless and violent way toward former President Donald Trump.
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.680]  Fortunately, his security has ramped up.
[00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:51.639]  He seems to be taking his security very seriously.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.520]  He's doing things like podcast interviews.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:16.030]  Of course, he's still doing his rallies, but it's amazing to see what's happening right now as the deep state becomes more and more increasingly desperate for As it becomes more and more obvious that Donald Trump is winning this election, I mean, we've gotten to a point where he's doing rallies in deep blue states because he's got the swing states in the bag.
[00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.169]  He's got all of the other states in the bag.
[00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:25.530]  Now he's just campaigning in the deep blue areas to try to win that popular vote so they can't argue that he didn't win the popular vote even when he wins the Electoral College.
[00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.389]  This is absolutely amazing to see.
[00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.129]  And we know that they're getting desperate because they tried so hard to keep Kamala Harris out of the media.
[00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.439]  For months and months and months.
[00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:37.719]  And she was criticized.
[00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.740]  Her campaign was criticized as if they were trying to hide her.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.819]  Of course, we understand why they were trying to hide her.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.639]  Because we saw the interview on CNN and how terrible that was.
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.560]  And then on The View and how terrible that was.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.620]  And then on the Call Me Daddy and how terrible that was.
[00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:54.840]  She is abundantly awful when she does these interviews on the fly.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.759]  Embarrassingly so. The 60 Minutes thing was like the nail in the coffin.
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.719]  It's one of the worst interviews I've ever seen in my entire life.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.979]  Adolf Hitler could have pulled that interview off better than Kamala Harris.
[00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.189]  Unbelievable, right?
[00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:08.949]  But we see that it's a Hail Mary.
[00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:18.930]  Given that she is so bad and nothing else is working, the only thing they can possibly try is to put her in front of as many Americans as possible in these interviews.
[00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.850]  That's why she's doing all these appearances despite how awful they are.
[00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.089]  This is a Hail Mary attempt to claw at any support that she possibly can in the face of victory.
[00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.430]  Stay tuned for Alex Jones and Dr.
[00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:31.209]  Drew on the other side of this one-minute break.
[00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:43.050]  A lot of excitement today. We are joined by Alex Jones, of course, the host of InfoWars.
[00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:44.850]  We've got a lot to get into today.
[00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.389]  Amongst other things, I want to hear his story.
[00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.110]  People focus on his history and how he's gotten to where he is now.
[00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.949]  And his career has spanned decades.
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.360]  And, of course, notoriety for some of his views on topics and government overreach.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.699]  And there's actually memes out there about Alex Jones' right when he was thought to have been conspiratorial.
[00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:09.879]  Lo and behold, turned out to be right, which is so many of the things that we learn about today.
[00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:12.500]  Alex, welcome. Thanks for having me.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.860]  It was great to have you on my show. It was great to be there.
[00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:21.019]  Listen, I wanted, if you don't mind, I want to start by talking about you, if you don't mind.
[00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.279]  I don't really see anybody interviewing you about your life, your career, your history.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.180]  I'm sure they did at one time, but I don't see that very often anymore.
[00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:36.240]  And as a guy that spent 35 years on the radio myself, I'm intrigued by your radio career, how you got involved with that.
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.379]  Do you mind talking about these things?
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.139]  I'm more than happy to. Where did you grow up?
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.540]  What kind of family did you grow up in?
[00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:46.060]  Who is Alex Jones? I'm trying to figure that part out.
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.540]  It's not that easy to figure out.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.180]  So clue us in on that and then how you got involved in radio.
[00:05:52.870 --> 00:06:10.189]  Sure. I mean, I've been incredibly demonized by the deep state, by the establishment, because I went to a lot of source documents about the permanent bureaucracy and some of the financial interests that would rather America and the world be a totalitarian, centralized technocracy in their own words.
[00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:12.360]  And so I've been on air 30 years.
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.060]  I started out on AXS TV in 1994.
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:22.519]  About a year later, I got a local call from a station that was flipping from rock music to talk on FM. We're doing a Saturday show.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.399]  It got good ratings. They gave me a weeknight show.
[00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:29.879]  I found out how to syndicate it through a small syndicator a few years later.
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.019]  So I've been syndicated on radio for...
[00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:36.379]  27 years. At times, the show got extremely big.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:42.259]  And then some of the things I said on air, taken out of context in the media, I would get kicked off a lot of stations.
[00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:44.259]  That happened after 9-11.
[00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.339]  Some of the things I said there, I was on over 200 radio stations, some of them huge then.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.680]  And I went down to about 40 radio stations with my comments about that.
[00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:55.120]  And then built the show back up over the years.
[00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:57.040]  Always wanted to find new ways to reach people.
[00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:58.680]  I was one of the first people...
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.800]  That was on Google Video and had some of the first document cam or webcams.
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.180]  At first, you're showing an image every 30 seconds or so.
[00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:16.399]  If I could show news articles and also make documentary films starting in the late 90s, 97 or so.
[00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:18.879]  If I could actually show listeners what I was talking about.
[00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:27.709]  Yeah, back in 94, what motivated you to get into that search for the deep state?
[00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:31.509]  Because I think, you know, to say you were ahead of the curve would be an understatement.
[00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.750]  I think even the concept wasn't something that was being tossed around at the time.
[00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.550]  What was going on with you that you had some insight into this?
[00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:49.209]  My dad had, in high school, got recruited into UT Plan II because he had some of the top test scores in the country.
[00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:56.050]  And so he got out of it before he ever got into the actual programs after he graduated.
[00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.910]  But he got recruited into the kind of scientific...
[00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.629]  I think?
[00:08:27.049 --> 00:08:30.329]  And I was a sports guy and everything else, but I did get into reading really early.
[00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:31.769]  I've always been a voracious reader.
[00:08:32.009 --> 00:08:38.370]  So I got out of comic books when I was about eight or nine and started reading military encyclopedias and history books.
[00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:47.009]  And so I really got into history and read Marco Cirilius' book and read Julius Caesar's writings and then got into Plato and got into Aristotle.
[00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.409]  And then I read Nietzsche's, a couple of his books.
[00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.850]  I read Machiavelli.
[00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:58.389]  By the time I was about 15, I read some of the Pulitzer Prize-winning books like Scherer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.
[00:08:58.529 --> 00:08:59.549]  I thought that was fascinating.
[00:09:00.009 --> 00:09:13.470]  Then I read a lot of other books about World War II. And so I guess because I had an interest in history, then I could see the parallels and also how I was grown up and just my family being informed.
[00:09:14.019 --> 00:09:17.139]  And my dad's, you know, dad was really informed.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.899]  His mom was informed. My mother's dad was also, had been in World War II, a fighter pilot, and then he'd been an inventor.
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.100]  You know, growing up in Dallas, a successful inventor.
[00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:29.960]  Growing up kind of in the German community in Dallas, there were a bunch of inventors.
[00:09:30.059 --> 00:09:32.820]  So I grew up around him and, you know, talking about how the world really worked.
[00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:42.940]  So I was just blessed that I was around a lot of people that were geopolitically aware of And I remember my dad ranting about Zbigniew Brzezinski when I was like five years old at the dinner table.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.779]  And you know, their plans for world government.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.740]  And so that's why I found that really interesting.
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.600]  And a lot was happening in 94, 95.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.740]  And so I didn't really try to be in the media.
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.080]  I wasn't thinking of that as a career.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.179]  I didn't know what I wanted to do. I'm 50 now.
[00:09:56.299 --> 00:09:59.220]  I was... You know, like, 20 years old when I first got on air.
[00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:04.460]  I thought, I'll go do Access Television, and then that was basically what happened there.
[00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:06.659]  So it was a 30-year overnight success story.
[00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:12.720]  And then when Trump won, or was about to win, the Democrats even admitted this.
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:28.820]  They... We're good to go.
[00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:37.279]  I think?
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.440]  It was pretty bombshell of a CIA guy.
[00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:05.279]  They were doing another investigation into human trafficking and were interviewing the CIA guy with hidden cameras.
[00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:13.419]  And he also admitted the whole plot to demonize me and take me off air and set the precedent with me and then ban everybody else.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.259]  And so now in hindsight, we know how that was done with the Democratic Party, PR firms, and the whole setup.
[00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:27.990]  So I... I really don't even see it as being a victim because it was very interesting to have the deep state kind of put me in its jaws and was quite a learning process.
[00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:39.429]  But because the deep state and the establishment is so discredited, just like all the indictments and convictions of Trump by these show trials has made him more popular, it's now had the opposite effect and made me more popular.
[00:11:39.929 --> 00:11:43.710]  And so it's a very, very crazy and bizarre place to be historically.
[00:11:43.769 --> 00:11:57.529]  And I kind of jumped ahead from my origin story To just what, you know, the current story, most of your viewers who may have heard of me but maybe never actually heard me, I mean, I want them to know they can look up everything I just said and they're actually admitting it.
[00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.830]  You know, that's what's crazy. Hillary Clinton has come out twice the last month and said, get rid of the First Amendment.
[00:12:02.529 --> 00:12:13.389]  John Kerry has said the First Amendment stands the way and that they want to, you know, I mean, now Facebook banned advertising on Instagram and Facebook under meta of the Reagan movie.
[00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:15.009]  That's like a sweet family movie.
[00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:20.190]  Absolutely just a very positive film, not even political.
[00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:22.370]  Left versus right.
[00:12:22.809 --> 00:12:27.149]  So now they even want to ban or restrict people seeing the Reagan movie.
[00:12:27.409 --> 00:12:30.350]  So that shows you where these totalitarians are going.
[00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:36.889]  Hillary just said last week, well, we're going to lose total control if we don't get control and start censoring people.
[00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:39.549]  So I was the first test case they now admit.
[00:12:40.909 --> 00:12:43.669]  I tried to set the precedent to be able to censor everybody else.
[00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:48.549]  And when a lot of people didn't stand up for me being censored, then it set the precedent for everybody else.
[00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:53.509]  And then Trump got banned on Twitter and Facebook and everywhere else.
[00:12:53.769 --> 00:12:58.009]  And they even took down his videos on January 6th saying, be peaceful when you go to the Capitol.
[00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:05.850]  And then later when he said, don't go in, don't be violent, they even removed that so that it couldn't be shown that he was not guilty of what they claimed.
[00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:10.190]  So that's what's scary about censorship is Is they don't just silence what you're saying.
[00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:14.850]  They can then lie about you and build a straw man and misrepresent who you are.
[00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.110]  So they basically steal your identity.
[00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:21.870]  So it's been very refreshing to have Elon Musk bring me back on X despite all the attacks and demonization and boycotts.
[00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:26.549]  And now X is the most popular social media platform in the world and it's dominating.
[00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:36.700]  And so the worm's turning and humanity has a real hunger and quest for For the right of not just to say what you want, but the right to hear what somebody else is saying.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:43.580]  And so I'm just very blessed to be part of this major global discourse and have a lot of hope and faith for humanity.
[00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.750]  Yeah, I've become a free speech absolutist, and thus you are here with me.
[00:13:50.129 --> 00:14:04.110]  And I noticed that the DOJ put something out today about what they want to do with Google and YouTube, which is essentially dismantle the whole thing, which I think will create an interesting reaction from a very powerful company.
[00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.529]  I can't imagine them doing that.
[00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.289]  But my question to you is, you mentioned Musk.
[00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:23.929]  What do you think about what Musk said about the We're good to go.
[00:14:35.559 --> 00:14:45.100]  Even before some of the first cases came up where he just literally was on house arrest, basically, would just check himself in a few hours a day there in Florida to the jail.
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:54.620]  And I was told that basically they were using classic honeypots, but it's not enough to have a guy cheating on his wife like 60 years ago.
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.879]  Or then the new thing was, oh, the person's gay.
[00:14:57.919 --> 00:15:07.789]  And so in a lot of these elite circles, like Bohemian Grove and things, Powerful people go there literally to be inducted into kind of the rite of passage so that they are in the club.
[00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.190]  Even Nixon talked about it.
[00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:14.649]  He didn't do it. But he said people basically go there, and the tapes are out there of Nixon, to be in that club.
[00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.370]  Then they think they can trust you. Well, it's not enough to be closeted gay now.
[00:15:17.529 --> 00:15:18.590]  That's not enough dirt on you.
[00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.230]  They want you to have sex with underage teenage girls and boys.
[00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:26.389]  And they've been very, very good at just keeping it to a few 16- and 17-year-olds.
[00:15:26.529 --> 00:15:40.669]  But what we know about I think?
[00:15:50.889 --> 00:15:58.590]  And he was running that famously, reportedly in the UK, and how they've got control of the UK government with pedophilia.
[00:15:59.009 --> 00:16:00.889]  And so Epstein...
[00:16:01.649 --> 00:16:09.289]  He's the most well-known person running one of these honeypot operations, but there's a lot of other organizations and groups that are doing it.
[00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:19.049]  In fact, my uncle on his deathbed 10 years ago told me in East Texas at the hospital, he's dying of pneumonia, and they got a really bad virus.
[00:16:19.129 --> 00:16:20.889]  He was a healthy guy, but it just looked like Popeye.
[00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.169]  He was in great shape, but it just killed him.
[00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.129]  And right before they put him on the ventilator, he'd already told me some of the stuff.
[00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:30.190]  He told my mom a lot more. I think?
[00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:45.159]  From Guatemala, little kids.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.200]  And he didn't know what they were doing, but they wouldn't get specific.
[00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:49.480]  And he thought it was child trafficking.
[00:16:49.639 --> 00:16:51.440]  And so he quit and got out of it then.
[00:16:52.759 --> 00:16:54.159]  And that was in the late 80s.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:59.799]  He did say that Reagan wasn't even aware of it because he was involved in communications and knew who was running it out of the White House.
[00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:01.419]  It was George Herbert Walker Bush, he told me.
[00:17:02.019 --> 00:17:03.980]  But that was that point for him.
[00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.960]  So this has been going on for a long time.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.900]  I remember like 15 years ago, Russia banned orphans coming to the U.S. and Putin said they're somewhere in sex slavery.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.240]  And so that sounds, those of us that aren't into that, unbelievable.
[00:17:17.519 --> 00:17:19.480]  But we see the sexualization of children.
[00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:30.880]  You know, the whole transgender thing is about, you know, sexualization of children and secret agreements in public schools where they don't tell the parents that they're convinced the kid to begin transitioning or believe they're transitioning.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.400]  And they put secret files together and they have NGOs that come in.
[00:17:34.579 --> 00:17:39.019]  So this whole attack on our children and their innocence that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:17:39.079 --> 00:17:54.339]  is talking about is really massive and central to And so when Musk talks about that, he told, as you know, Tucker, he said, no, I know most of the people in the deep state, and I'm telling you, because we already know some of their names from the flights, like Bill Gates,
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.920]  the 30-something times, that...
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.240]  This is the deep state.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:06.059]  And then you get into who basically was one of the biggest attendees there at Little St.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:14.980]  John's Island. And of course, the Zorro Ranch and other groups is the widow of Steve Jobs and best friends with Ghislaine Maxwell.
[00:18:15.279 --> 00:18:17.660]  So when you look at this power structure...
[00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.190]  It's just insane.
[00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:28.650]  And Bill Gates, we know, is into giving money to the top scientists and others to control scientific thoughts, and he spends billions every few years on media.
[00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:38.710]  When you see a big piece on him in the newspaper or online in the London Guardian or ABC News, a lot of times at the end they'll say, underwritten by the Bella Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:44.269]  Now she's now left him and gotten out of the foundation, she said, mainly because of the Jeffrey Epstein thing.
[00:18:44.269 --> 00:19:00.880]  So we're waiting for the next big shoe to drop, but Clearly, they're using blackmail on scientists of the sexual nature, and that's why I believe the evidence shows that that's why Gates is so connected to that.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.980]  And again, it's not like they even trick most of these people.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:10.099]  Just like in the mafia, you've got to kill a few people in the Italian mafia to make your bones in La Cosa Nostra.
[00:19:11.059 --> 00:19:15.299]  Or the family. And then the Mexican Mafia and other mafias are, you know, Hell's Angels.
[00:19:15.839 --> 00:19:19.859]  You've got to commit some murders before you're really a made member because they can control you.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.440]  They know that you'll do what you're told and they can destroy you anytime they want.
[00:19:25.779 --> 00:19:34.279]  Well, the rite of passage or the induction ceremony into this globalist cabal is generally pedophilia.
[00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:46.150]  I want to push back on the Bohemian Grove thing for a second, if you don't mind, because I've been practicing medicine here in Southern California for like 40, coming down to 40 years.
[00:19:46.289 --> 00:19:47.369]  Is it 40 years? Jesus.
[00:19:48.509 --> 00:20:00.970]  And maybe 20 years ago, I had a lot of 80 and 90-year-old patients who were former sort of part of the Reagan inner circle when he was governor of California.
[00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.890]  And they all used to go to Bohemian Grove.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:11.000]  You know, right-leaning thing where they would go and hear lectures and stuff and just sort of hang out and smoke cigars.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.680]  I don't know if it's been captured.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.640]  I don't have any recent information about it.
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:19.660]  But I just want you to file that in your thinking that I actually had direct contact with a number of these guys.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.420]  And they were not, as you described them, now.
[00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:23.859]  So it may be something different now.
[00:20:23.859 --> 00:20:26.380]  I don't know. But I want to circle.
[00:20:26.779 --> 00:20:29.920]  That's fascinating. So I can come back to it if you want to say something else now.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.019]  But I would love to agree with you right now.
[00:20:33.109 --> 00:20:38.849]  I want to be clear. I'm the first person to ever successfully sneak into Bohemian Grove and get the Formation of Care ritual on tape.
[00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.609]  I saw Danny Glover when I was in there.
[00:20:41.769 --> 00:20:47.250]  I saw one of my, probably my favorite actor, one of my favorite, you know, actors, Clint Eastwood, when I was in there.
[00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.809]  There's a thousand members, a thousand guests.
[00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:58.430]  95% of it is just getting, you know, having fun, listening to music, and drinking in this beautiful old Redwood Grove there in Sedoma County on the Russian River.
[00:20:58.789 --> 00:21:09.470]  Richard Nixon, just type it in, Richard Nixon on Bohemian Grove, his famous tapes are on that, and he said it's the most GD, you know, faggy thing you've ever seen, and then...
[00:21:11.779 --> 00:21:27.599]  Helmut Schmidt wrote a book about it, talked about it, and so what I'm saying is, there is a group within that, and you can look up Bohemian Grove Homosexuality, and it's been news articles written about If you want to get in the club of the club there,
[00:21:27.859 --> 00:21:29.319]  a bunch of that is going on.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.740]  And of course, Mark Twain founded it.
[00:21:30.819 --> 00:21:32.339]  It wasn't like that in the 1870s.
[00:21:32.859 --> 00:21:37.680]  And then William Howard Taft, who was a Skull and Bones member and a president, the railroad got there.
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:38.980]  The Republicans took it over.
[00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:43.140]  It was more of a Skull and Bones spinoff for adults, kind of ultramasonic.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:49.039]  But I was specifically talking about About, you know, used to it, you're cheating on your wife, we got dirt.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.960]  And then it's okay, you did a, you know, kind of a gay ritual like they do at Scull and Bones, that's come out.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.220]  And they do it in like a vat of horse manure.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:01.140]  I mean, you know, that's even in The Good Shepherd that was directed and produced by...
[00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:03.440]  Robert De Niro with Matt Damon.
[00:22:03.599 --> 00:22:05.259]  And they've said that's very accurate.
[00:22:05.619 --> 00:22:08.099]  Of course, Anthony Sutton was the head Senate archivist.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.420]  He got the documents from Charlotte Iserby, whose dad was a member of it.
[00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:12.940]  So that's why we know all that.
[00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:18.440]  But absolutely, most people going to Bohemian Grove are not in homosexual cults.
[00:22:19.569 --> 00:22:22.730]  Sorry, go ahead. I want to cycle back.
[00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:29.089]  You said you used a phrase about what you were exposed to growing up, how the world works.
[00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:32.630]  And then you also talked about your love of history.
[00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:45.890]  Given those two experiences, you educated yourself about world events and the cycles of history, and you said something like, this always happens, or whatever.
[00:22:46.009 --> 00:22:47.109]  I don't know what you meant quite by that.
[00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:48.869]  And how the world works.
[00:22:49.319 --> 00:22:54.660]  Help me understand what your theory is about our present moment within the grand historical sweep.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:01.000]  History does, maybe it doesn't exactly repeat itself, but it sort of echoes.
[00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:07.380]  To me, it feels like this kind of thing that's happening now happens every 80 or so years.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.240]  It's different always.
[00:23:09.559 --> 00:23:12.640]  I noticed something yesterday when I was thinking about it.
[00:23:13.319 --> 00:23:16.880]  Is that this kind of thing never happened before the printing press.
[00:23:17.579 --> 00:23:24.960]  And so technology clearly plays a role in how these things are executed and sort of brought to bear on a mass scale.
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:29.039]  And now we've never had such an efficient mass technology.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.700]  How do you understand what's happening in the present moment?
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:58.349]  That's a great question. We're good to go.
[00:24:12.829 --> 00:24:16.829]  They believe we're about to transcend, but that most of us won't basically transcend in that.
[00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:21.369]  So they know a major change is coming, and the establishment wants to stay in power.
[00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:27.410]  And power groups, whether it's in ancient China or Europe or Mesoamerica, anywhere...
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:34.640]  Always you see a civilization rise, and then it gets powerful, and then it becomes decadent, and then it declines and collapses.
[00:24:35.099 --> 00:24:37.259]  And that can happen in different ways.
[00:24:37.619 --> 00:24:44.299]  Of course, there's the saying that hard times make strong men, strong men make good times, good times make weak men, weak men make bad times.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:51.339]  And so if you read a lot of what the top thinkers think in the establishment, they talk about the end of history.
[00:24:51.809 --> 00:25:03.509]  And they want to have kind of a breakaway civilization of technocracy and elites that keep most of that secret from the public on their government and corporate reservations, kind of city-states within city-states.
[00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:10.589]  And then the nation-state dissolves away into a kind of a global order that's controlled by three major power blocks and then separate...
[00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:12.569]  Sub-blocks in that.
[00:25:13.049 --> 00:25:15.369]  And they kind of want the public distracted with video games.
[00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:19.349]  But does history tell you that's a likely scenario?
[00:25:20.049 --> 00:25:24.349]  And does your understanding of the way the world works indicate to you that that's how it's going?
[00:25:24.809 --> 00:25:27.529]  It could also be going that way and not work out.
[00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.069]  You know what I mean? History could tell you, no, no, no, this won't happen.
[00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:34.029]  Well, how do you... Does history inform those perceptions you have?
[00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:35.529]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:37.130]  The way you said it, I've never heard that.
[00:25:38.229 --> 00:25:40.009]  History repeats somewhat.
[00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.549]  It's been said history rhymes, but I agree history echoes.
[00:25:44.609 --> 00:25:47.109]  And so let's be clear.
[00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:52.849]  I'm stating what the general thought in the different thought thinkers from different angles is.
[00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:55.130]  And of course, you're informed. You already know that probably more than I do.
[00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.950]  But I totally agree with what you were just kind of hinting at.
[00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:04.380]  And the globalists now, their main mouthpiece is the Atlantic, the Financial Times of London.
[00:26:04.839 --> 00:26:10.660]  I mean, those are really kind of the establishment mouthpieces, the Club of Rome, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission.
[00:26:10.859 --> 00:26:23.990]  They admit they're losing control and their plan that they thought for this technocracy and this things to come that kind of H.G. Wells is one of the progenitors I think?
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:38.960]  So now their plan is actually not working.
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:48.359]  They also said corporate world government would be administered to end war and to redistribute wealth, not through communism, but through kind of a crony capitalist system.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.440]  But of course, we've seen a bigger vertical integration of wealth.
[00:26:51.829 --> 00:26:52.849]  We've never seen in history.
[00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.470]  And these greedy groups basically pay no taxes.
[00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.430]  And so they have all this altruistic talk.
[00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:01.349]  They even admit it's falling apart because they all just ran off with the money.
[00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:05.089]  And now they think things are falling apart so bad that it's even mainstream news.
[00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.569]  I broke this, you know, decades ago.
[00:27:09.059 --> 00:27:12.480]  These top billionaires are all building huge bunkers in the middle of nowhere.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:22.160]  Zuckerberg's got his in Kauai, and they are all, you know, just waiting to run to the hills and all have these huge escape yachts that aren't just for entertaining.
[00:27:23.019 --> 00:27:26.779]  And I mean, I knew from sources I talked about this almost 18 years ago.
[00:27:27.039 --> 00:27:34.980]  I was with a big producer in Hollywood, and he went around and showed me the studios of James Cameron, making a movie with him.
[00:27:35.119 --> 00:27:39.420]  They said, oh, Cameron probably won't make many more movies, which he really hasn't, because he thinks the end of the world's coming.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:45.259]  He's gone to New Zealand, and he was going to roll out all the hologram movie theaters and all this, but he just doesn't think it's going to matter.
[00:27:45.779 --> 00:27:49.680]  And then they told me later, I saw pieces of the news that, oh, yeah, Cameron...
[00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:54.630]  Cameron, you know, has this fleet of ships, he says, looking for sunken ships.
[00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:56.509]  But really, that's the tax write-off.
[00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.109]  So when everything collapses, he can escape to the ocean.
[00:27:59.329 --> 00:28:00.730]  Well, then now you see the headlines.
[00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.170]  Elites, you know, have the...
[00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:04.150]  Right, I hear what you're saying.
[00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:05.509]  And so that's my question.
[00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:09.170]  I'm asking you actually to kind of predict the future, what you're feeling about the future.
[00:28:09.349 --> 00:28:18.549]  Because I'm not really... I'm hearing you say that they think it's going to be a catastrophe or they think they're going to be able to centralize and end war and distribute wealth, that kind of thing.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:28.140]  So my question to you is, is one of those outcomes likely in your opinion, or are they just going to fail?
[00:28:28.259 --> 00:28:37.200]  Are they just going to fail, and people are going to get back to taking care of their own families and their own communities and become hyper-localized, which is really the bromide for all this?
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.559]  What's your prediction? Well...
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:49.920]  I don't think that the establishment, which act like they're all unified, and they'll agree on certain policies and power grabs, but they're actually fighting with each other.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.420]  They call themselves the Anglo-American establishment.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.900]  And notice when Putin talks about the West, he calls it that.
[00:28:57.039 --> 00:29:03.519]  And that's an old term, but that's what they call themselves, kind of the British Empire merged with America and the West, and then kind of the EU is in the middle.
[00:29:03.839 --> 00:29:10.859]  And then China is the other big power block, and then Russia, junior to that, and you've got the Arab states and, you know, all the things that are happening.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.920]  But absolutely, that really is the question.
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.799]  I believe we control our destiny.
[00:29:14.799 --> 00:29:18.019]  I'm seeing major signs everywhere of not just...
[00:29:18.779 --> 00:29:29.299]  The globalist plan for world government failing, and then there being giant wars due to, you know, the issues that are there, and not just problems they've caused.
[00:29:29.339 --> 00:29:40.720]  We've got plenty of problems the globalists didn't cause, and the technocrats didn't cause, versus people like Elon Musk coming in, admitting, you know, at the World Government Summit last year, put on with the WEF. He said, we want firewalls.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.960]  We want, you know, bulkheads and ships.
[00:29:43.059 --> 00:29:45.059]  We don't want a one-world government with centralized stuff.
[00:29:45.079 --> 00:29:51.880]  That always creates a nightmare. We want decentralization and then good ideas Globally, but also locally, that people then adopt.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.799]  Is that going to win? Is that going to happen?
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.779]  What's your prediction? I want you to put a bet down.
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:17.309]  I want to bet. I would give us about a 60% chance that we're able to stabilize the planet and be honest and release all these advanced technologies and things that the globalists see as disruptive and really not try to dumb people down and not try to have a destabilized population as easy to control.
[00:30:17.569 --> 00:30:21.710]  I believe we can turn the ship around so there's going to be some major crises, some serious wars.
[00:30:22.289 --> 00:30:27.529]  But I'd say about a 60% chance we don't kill each other in a bioweapon war or a nuclear war.
[00:30:27.809 --> 00:30:32.829]  And there's not going to be some utopia that I'm predicting like, you know, the left or the globalists do.
[00:30:32.869 --> 00:30:47.430]  That's all a lie. But definitely a better course and way more positive, amazing times if people just get informed about issues and demand their rights and also work hard and get excited about innovation and excited about the future.
[00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.069]  I see a golden age, quite frankly.
[00:30:50.359 --> 00:30:51.799]  Well, you know, it's funny.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.539]  I've heard that from various sources.
[00:30:53.779 --> 00:31:04.160]  And theoretically, your fourth turning, the book you described, that's kind of what they suggest, is that the generation that comes into the fourth turning is a heroic generation and will cause...
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:17.799]  I don't see the road out myself, but I do know that the enemy is over-centralization and that taking care of your own family, your own neighborhood, your own community has always been the answer.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:19.359]  That's how humans have evolved.
[00:31:20.819 --> 00:31:28.099]  And notice, everything the WEF does, it's just a mouthpiece to the biggest Fortune 100, is you can't have your own organic farm.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.579]  It's bad. Eating meat's bad.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.900]  Having a car's bad.
[00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:32.099]  Going anywhere's bad.
[00:31:32.319 --> 00:31:34.980]  You're bad. Let us take your life under our control.
[00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:36.900]  Your life force, your instinct's bad.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:45.900]  Don't have children. They just want us to give up and turn history over to them and just let them be captains of the ship to the point where they don't even realize that we're on a ship or there are captains.
[00:31:46.059 --> 00:31:47.420]  They just want us out of the way.
[00:31:47.819 --> 00:31:49.839]  Definitely that power structure's imploding.
[00:31:51.959 --> 00:32:07.859]  We're good to go.
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.880]  I would get 95% love over the years, but wasn't super famous.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:26.839]  People knew who I was, but I would shake hands at the grocery store when I'd walk the dog, when I'd go to church, you know, anywhere.
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:29.180]  I ran into a lot of people that liked the show or seen my work.
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:42.519]  When Trump got in, it went from, you know, 99% love, because people don't like you, aren't going to say anything usually, to, you know, 90% love, 10% being yelled at on the street, yelled at in restaurants, yelled at in grocery stores, yelled at at the mall, yelled at at the doctor's office.
[00:32:43.059 --> 00:32:51.890]  And then when they started indicting Trump and people saw how bad Biden was, I get yelled at every six months now in public or something.
[00:32:52.069 --> 00:32:54.730]  And even people that shake their heads at me and go, you know, actually, you're right.
[00:32:54.829 --> 00:32:56.930]  You know, I was wrong about you. And it's not about me.
[00:32:57.009 --> 00:33:03.950]  It's just that I'm seen as a bellwether that the system said is the most evil person since Satan and, you know, since Adolf Hitler.
[00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:09.049]  And the system's so discredited that their attack on me is the endorsement I could never do.
[00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:13.390]  And so that, to me, is emblematic of how big the...
[00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.569]  Yeah. Yeah. You just made me think.
[00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:17.210]  I'm so committed to free speech.
[00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.289]  If you were Satan, I would still talk to you.
[00:33:20.329 --> 00:33:23.509]  I would love to.
[00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.049]  Right? I would love to interview Satan.
[00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:28.029]  Sure. Right, me too.
[00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:29.549]  But two things.
[00:33:29.869 --> 00:33:32.710]  And then, Caleb, you're going to come in here because my...
[00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:38.029]  My technical director is a big, big Alex Jones fan.
[00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:39.750]  He had a couple questions. I want to give him a chance.
[00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:42.730]  But two comments of what you just said before we do.
[00:33:43.069 --> 00:33:51.289]  It was either Peter Thiel or Mark Dandresen said, be careful with the darkest before the dawn because another way to look at it is it's darkest before it's pitch black.
[00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:53.450]  So be careful.
[00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:56.589]  It can get a lot worse before it gets better.
[00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:58.430]  I agree. I don't think we've hit bottom yet.
[00:33:59.509 --> 00:34:00.690]  I don't think we've hit bottom yet.
[00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:02.450]  Go ahead. Okay, fair enough.
[00:34:02.569 --> 00:34:04.269]  Fair enough. I'll quote you on that.
[00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:12.050]  And as far as captains, you know, these centralizing captains, how much of a student of history do you have to be to understand how bad that turns out?
[00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:14.469]  Every time. Every time.
[00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:15.750]  You name it.
[00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:17.150]  It ends badly.
[00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:19.590]  You name it. Any historical sweep.
[00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:25.469]  And when there's a centralization of history, Anything, it ends badly.
[00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.210]  So I just want to point that out again.
[00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:29.469]  But, Caleb, you have some questions for Alex, I assume?
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:38.420]  Yeah, hi, Alex. I grew up in Austin, Texas, actually, so I remember listening to you on my dad's radio decades and decades ago, and you probably remember this as well.
[00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:46.960]  Back then, all of us were just, like, the crazy anti-vaxxer, homeschooler, farm prepper people, like the real outcasts of society.
[00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:48.980]  But now you fast-forward to the day...
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.840]  That was you, Al. That was Caleb. He's describing himself.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:55.460]  That was back then. But, I mean, a lot of us, like, you show up at these events, and it's, like, kind of the same type of people.
[00:34:55.599 --> 00:34:58.579]  But that was 20, 30 years ago, the outcasts.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:02.460]  But now you fast forward to today and all of a sudden, like, Alex Jones, that's a household name.
[00:35:02.539 --> 00:35:03.739]  Everybody knows who Alex Jones is.
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:07.480]  And now you have Dr. Drew talking about this rational revolution stuff.
[00:35:07.639 --> 00:35:11.500]  So it's not my mother's fringe group anymore.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.820]  But then with that, what's happening...
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.119]  But Caleb, hold on.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:27.079]  You bring up something interesting, which I'll let you finish your question, but I hope Alex can also point out, which is I worry about people becoming paranoid or conspiratorial and detaching from reality.
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.739]  I really worry about that.
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.880]  I also worry about the delusionality and aggression on the left, because I'm so moderate.
[00:35:33.039 --> 00:35:34.559]  I sit in the middle and see the excesses on both sides.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:38.579]  But finish your—we'll let him contextualize your question with that.
[00:35:38.679 --> 00:35:43.869]  Go ahead, finish. Actually, what I'm talking about is something that goes even further than that.
[00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:53.690]  It's a step beyond into deeper into this anxiety spiral where it's the movement that's inside of our movement that's now saying, wait a second, something is so suspicious.
[00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:59.849]  Why are the powers that be that have all the power in the world allowing people like Alex Jones or Dr.
[00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:03.789]  Drew to speak freely about globalism and the NSA and big pharma?
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.260]  Unless they're controlled opposition, that's the new term.
[00:36:07.539 --> 00:36:16.199]  So how do you respond to, like, the allies that should be your allies who suddenly think that you're the enemy just because people are finally listening to you after all these years?
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:20.059]  It's a great question because that is all about the paranoia I was talking about.
[00:36:20.159 --> 00:36:21.599]  So let's let Alex answer that.
[00:36:22.509 --> 00:36:28.250]  Absolutely. And by the way, I told you guys I had to go in 45 minutes because I have to sign a document because my bankruptcy is ending in the next few days.
[00:36:28.369 --> 00:36:29.610]  But I've got time.
[00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.190]  I can do another 20 minutes or whatever you want.
[00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:32.909]  Or if you want to kick me out of here in five, I can stay.
[00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:35.409]  But this is a really important question.
[00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:37.110]  I'm glad you asked the best I've heard.
[00:36:37.449 --> 00:36:41.010]  And I could literally talk for 10 hours about this, but let me try to boil this down for people.
[00:36:42.239 --> 00:36:46.219]  I know 100% that I'm a real person, organic, self-trained.
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.579]  I really care about people.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.880]  I care about my children.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.239]  If you care about your children, you care about the world they're going to grow up in.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.940]  You don't have the sociopathic idea that you get ahead by hurting people.
[00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:59.239]  It's the opposite. So that said, let me answer the question this way.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.039]  Elon Musk's brother got really sick from the COVID shot.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.639]  Elon Musk's son...
[00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:22.789]  We're good to go.
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:23.920]  The current power structure.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.219]  And you can say he sees them going down and he wants to position himself in the future.
[00:37:28.599 --> 00:37:36.659]  Okay, fine. The point is, is that all the top talk show hosts, you know, whether it's Tucker Carlson or Joe Rogan or Dr.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:40.789]  Drew or, you know, you name it, I mean, I could name hundreds of really big people.
[00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:53.949]  All the top shows are anti-globalist, pro-human decentralization because we're sane and don't want to destroy the world and don't want to centralize tyranny and don't want a universal credit score and don't want our medical freedom taken away.
[00:37:54.150 --> 00:38:00.170]  And so... There's a strong life force to be free and be successful.
[00:38:00.469 --> 00:38:02.329]  So that's the pull, but you're right.
[00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:07.050]  People get red-pilled, and then they go out there, and there's a lot of stuff.
[00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:14.070]  Just because there's extreme lying by Kamala Harris denying she's against fracking or wants to take your guns or just next-level lying...
[00:38:14.849 --> 00:38:27.449]  I think?
[00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:38.440]  And so that's, but at the end of the day, that can get unhealthy, but it's less unhealthy than believing everything you're told.
[00:38:38.619 --> 00:38:39.780]  And I think that's a process.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:55.400]  So you have red pill, you have black pill that thinks everything's doomed, and then you've got people that are awake and trying to learn that a red pill, you've got black pill that thinks everything's screwed, everybody's bad but them, and then you've got the white pill that thinks everything's, you know, Fine, either with the establishment or you think it's all going to turn out okay.
[00:38:55.559 --> 00:38:57.420]  I'm not red pill, black pill, or white pill.
[00:38:57.559 --> 00:39:01.099]  I invented a term called, just recently, green pill.
[00:39:01.559 --> 00:39:14.639]  And by that, I know we go through processes, birth, growth, development, speaking, declining, dying, in civilizations, in people, in life, in the universe, in stars, in galaxies, in everything.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:20.260]  And so it's more about knowing the processes It's not like I know how the world works.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:33.920]  I can see the processes in history and laws and tendencies and how the ripples in the pond from the pebble and the Hegelian dialect and how these systems work and how the establishment thinks trying to get full control.
[00:39:34.139 --> 00:39:35.159]  They're not omnipresent.
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.320]  All the propaganda and censorship would not be necessary.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.340]  It's been said a million times.
[00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:41.110]  We didn't have power.
[00:39:41.389 --> 00:39:43.849]  So people need to have faith in humanity.
[00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:45.289]  We go through these cycles.
[00:39:45.409 --> 00:39:49.210]  There's not just evil, not just corruption, not just ignorance, not just selfishness.
[00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:51.110]  And most of it's not organized evil.
[00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:55.269]  It's lazy people just doing whatever's easy and going with the flow and stagnation.
[00:39:55.789 --> 00:40:01.130]  And so people have to make them feel more superior to claim I'm loyal opposition to God knows what, fine.
[00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:07.989]  But I have the establishment literally trying to destroy me, the Justice Department, in the news, calling for me to be shut down.
[00:40:08.429 --> 00:40:12.170]  And so I am a maverick, and I am a person that believes in humanity.
[00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:15.510]  And so it doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:18.610]  I've made plenty of mistakes. But the difference is I know that I know nothing.
[00:40:18.969 --> 00:40:24.010]  These people that think they know everything know absolutely nothing.
[00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:31.250]  Right, right. And I mean, that's the biggest sign for me is like you literally you just said a minute ago, you have to leave our show soon to go sign some bankruptcy documents.
[00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:34.969]  Like if you were a CIA asset, that would have gone away a long time ago.
[00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:42.289]  And I know Drew isn't controlled opposition, because I'd be getting those sweet little CIA commission checks like I'd have a lot more stuff.
[00:40:42.519 --> 00:40:43.599]  I'd get commissions on that.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:49.559]  So I know internally, I don't know how to prove it, but I know absolutely certain that he's not a CIA asset.
[00:40:50.119 --> 00:40:53.119]  One of the things about delusions is they can't be reasoned with.
[00:40:53.519 --> 00:41:09.599]  So I'd be careful. And that's why it drives me crazy is because it seems like it's such a defeatist attitude because for me as someone who grew up And as an outcast, because of my family was like this, I understand the suspicions, because for so long we were exclusively outsiders.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:15.960]  And it reminds me of, there was a guy, I don't know if you're familiar with Hal Turner from back in 2008, where he was an FBI informant.
[00:41:16.059 --> 00:41:22.880]  Like, this has happened before with people who are radio hosts, that they get turned by the CIA or the FBI and they infiltrate the movements.
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.519]  I'm sure it's happening right now with some people.
[00:41:25.519 --> 00:41:33.780]  And it's very easy to spot those people, like that Michigan militia that the FBI created to try to get to kidnap Whitmer.
[00:41:34.199 --> 00:41:41.539]  I mean, Hal Turner was openly stirring stuff up and then trying to get crazies to organize things so the FBI would have a setup.
[00:41:41.639 --> 00:41:49.260]  Even like the New York Times back when it was half-decent 20 years ago ran the headline, the majority of terror plots are hatched and run by the FBI. I think that's the exact...
[00:41:55.329 --> 00:41:56.730]  Right.
[00:42:10.329 --> 00:42:29.409]  We're good to go.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:38.699]  He showed him a video of computer graphics of hotels and golf courses, and Kim Jong Un reportedly cried, but China, you know, basically controls North Korea, so he couldn't do it.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.079]  He said, why have slaves?
[00:42:40.219 --> 00:42:41.800]  Why don't you have golf courses?
[00:42:42.019 --> 00:42:43.360]  Why don't you be a rock star?
[00:42:43.559 --> 00:42:49.239]  And that's what Trump wants is, is like Santa Claus, to have fun and believe in humanity.
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.860]  And so you can judge him by what he does.
[00:42:52.099 --> 00:42:54.139]  You can judge me. I'm the same type of guy.
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.630]  I just want, you know, Open, free, great society.
[00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:00.610]  Masculinity, femininity, if you want to be whatever, something.
[00:43:00.889 --> 00:43:02.110]  You want to say you're a dog, that's fine.
[00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:04.730]  Just don't try to teach my kid at school to crap in a cat box.
[00:43:04.989 --> 00:43:08.650]  We don't want to be part of the mental illness, but you can go be mentally ill if you want.
[00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:10.750]  So, come from Access Television.
[00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:12.489]  Hold on. I'm real. So that's my question.
[00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:24.889]  That's what that leads to. So as someone who's been in this, and you've seen a lot of actual controlled opposition go in and out of this whole movement, what are some signs of actual controlled opposition agents that are infiltrating?
[00:43:24.989 --> 00:43:28.710]  Because I can pick two or three out right now that are pretty clear.
[00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:30.530]  Caleb, I'm going to kick you off.
[00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:34.090]  I've got to finish with Alex after that, so I'll let him answer your question.
[00:43:34.659 --> 00:43:36.119]  Because I know it's bothering you.
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:39.039]  But I'd be happy to have your producer on.
[00:43:39.179 --> 00:43:43.360]  We should have this discussion on my show and be two hours commercial free or simulcasting.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.219]  This is great. There you go.
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.360]  I like that idea.
[00:43:48.079 --> 00:43:49.320]  Yeah. Caleb, simulcast.
[00:43:49.519 --> 00:43:50.619]  There you go. We'll figure that out.
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.099]  Absolutely. I would absolutely do it.
[00:43:53.739 --> 00:43:56.019]  Yeah, I mean, one thing I've never done is infight.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:02.940]  I've never tried to be territorial or like the gatekeeper like the left, like I'm a fact checker and I say what's real and what's not.
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:10.139]  Most of these government plants and people reveal themselves, or they're not government plants, but they get in trouble, then they flip to the other side.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:18.659]  Look, I've had the Justice Department in the mediations, which I couldn't talk about until they said it openly outside of mediation, and my lawyer said, no, go ahead and talk about it.
[00:44:19.099 --> 00:44:24.280]  They have federal prosecutors and people running these fake lawsuits against me, and they literally say...
[00:44:25.099 --> 00:44:29.719]  They're in federal court in places with a judge in federal mediation and state mediation.
[00:44:30.079 --> 00:44:32.400]  Look, just we'll drop all this.
[00:44:32.559 --> 00:44:34.960]  We just have a we want you to come out against the Second Amendment.
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.519]  And I say, OK, let me guess.
[00:44:37.639 --> 00:44:39.219]  There's more. They go, actually, there is.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.000]  Are you open? And I said, no, of course, there's more.
[00:44:42.159 --> 00:44:43.780]  I wouldn't come out against the Second Amendment.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:52.989]  We left alone. But I said, plus I know once I feed the pirate, once I feed the crocodile, it's always going to come back for more, like a social credit score.
[00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:54.210]  They're always going to raise the bar.
[00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:56.349]  And so I said, no, I know how this works.
[00:44:57.070 --> 00:45:05.789]  So I've literally had them say, we will drop all this before they had their show trials and after.
[00:45:06.429 --> 00:45:08.289]  Give you bend the knee.
[00:45:08.849 --> 00:45:10.030]  And they just can't believe...
[00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:11.369]  So, I mean, you talk about the deep state.
[00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:25.550]  I am saying these Democrat Party law firms run by Senator Blumenthal, the same ones that sue Trump and Giuliani and all of them, they spent $70 million, that's in court filings, the last seven years suing me and attacking me and lying about me, trying to get...
[00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:27.550]  I've spent $15 million fighting them, okay?
[00:45:27.809 --> 00:45:32.920]  And literally, I break bombshells that are confirmed I've said this on air.
[00:45:33.039 --> 00:45:34.380]  Notice they don't say it's not true.
[00:45:34.579 --> 00:45:35.699]  They don't respond back.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.659]  They literally politically did all this.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.000]  On the courthouse steps, they say, we want him off the air.
[00:45:40.239 --> 00:45:42.639]  They refuse a $70 million settlement with me.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.440]  Over 10 years, I have to bust my ass to pay him that, more than I ever made personally before.
[00:45:46.739 --> 00:45:48.599]  They lie and say I have $4 million in the bank.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.059]  All of it was BS, and they said it's not about money, no settlement.
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:59.250]  So they can now, with a non-dischargeable judgment of a billion and a half dollars, Chase me around and harass me for the rest of my life.
[00:45:59.389 --> 00:46:02.610]  Well, good. I love it. If that's the cost of telling the truth, I don't care.
[00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:05.110]  It's fun to be the rebel. It's fun to be the maverick.
[00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:06.250]  And I just love it.
[00:46:06.329 --> 00:46:09.170]  I love it. I love the fact that they hate me so much.
[00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:12.530]  Both my grandfathers were in World War II. One was a fighter pilot.
[00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:15.469]  The other was a B-17 pilot flying across whole nine yards.
[00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:17.789]  And they didn't have really good radar then.
[00:46:17.869 --> 00:46:19.170]  They had it on the ground, but not in the planes.
[00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:21.590]  And they didn't have good topography maps.
[00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:30.550]  But they knew to go to the factories and military bases because the Germans put up their flak guns and they saw the flak, the explosions of shrapnel, and they flew into it.
[00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:37.250]  But just like my grandfather Jerry Jones flew into the flak over Italy and Germany, I'm flying into the flak and I love it.
[00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:39.150]  And their attacks are my radar.
[00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:42.809]  I go to where I'm being punched in the face and attack the hardest.
[00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:46.050]  That is my heat-seeking missile and I love it.
[00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:47.449]  I love it. I love it.
[00:46:48.809 --> 00:46:50.690]  Alex, I appreciate you being here.
[00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:56.949]  You mentioned GWF Hagel a few minutes ago, and I will just finish with an interpretation.
[00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:12.150]  He spoke in a lot of—his language was sort of impenetrable, but one of the things he said about history is history is—he said this, the owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the setting of dusk.
[00:47:12.739 --> 00:47:23.340]  The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the setting of dusk, which means that the wisdom of history reveals itself only once it's passed.
[00:47:23.679 --> 00:47:28.400]  So we will see where this all goes, you and I, and we will have more conversations, I hope.
[00:47:28.599 --> 00:47:32.760]  And I appreciate you being here, and good luck with your paperwork today.
[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:36.940]  It sounds unpleasant, but I get that you're over the target.
[00:47:37.119 --> 00:47:39.280]  So I appreciate you being here.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:56.900]  Appreciate you. If people can find The Forbidden Show at realalexjonesonx, please follow me there at infowars.com until the 13th, where it goes up on the chopping block, and the patriots are trying to buy it, but Soros, through Media Matters, is probably going to buy it to shut it down as some celebration, and they're going to try to, you know, like a Roman standard they've captured,
[00:47:57.039 --> 00:48:00.019]  mount it on the wall. It's only going to make us bigger because we know we're winning.
[00:48:00.179 --> 00:48:02.639]  We only lose if they convince us that we've lost.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:04.519]  We're winning. Humanity's turning the tide.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.460]  Dr. Drew and crew, look forward to talking to you soon.
[00:48:06.739 --> 00:48:09.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is The Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:10.820]  I'm your host this evening, Chase Geiser.
[00:48:11.099 --> 00:48:12.719]  It is almost 5 p.m.
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.400]  Central. We will be on the air for the next three hours together.
[00:48:15.539 --> 00:48:20.280]  Two hours of news and clips, one hour of calls per usual.
[00:48:21.039 --> 00:48:24.099]  We've got just three short minutes left of this segment, folks.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:30.239]  This week on thealexjonesstore.com, we had an amazing blowout sale.
[00:48:30.239 --> 00:48:31.380]  We sold out of the gummies.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:35.960]  Basically in like 48 hours, even though we ordered thousands of units.
[00:48:36.139 --> 00:48:42.400]  We have more coming in of the gummies that will be available on the 25th of October.
[00:48:42.739 --> 00:48:49.300]  Until then, we have launched the CMOS capsules, which are supposed to be even more potent than the gummies.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:55.460]  For reasons I do not understand, but the capsules are available now for purchase.
[00:48:55.599 --> 00:49:05.119]  So if you just really want the CMOS in your life and you don't want to wait till the 25th for the gummies, which were one of our most popular products ever, then I highly recommend checking out the CMOS capsules.
[00:49:06.659 --> 00:49:08.380]  Everything's the same. The only difference is the medium.
[00:49:08.639 --> 00:49:10.400]  It's the capsule version of the gummies.
[00:49:10.519 --> 00:49:15.300]  Please check it out now at thealexjonesstore.com because we don't know what's going to happen to Infowars.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:34.519]  We don't know if it's going to be bought by Soros through Media Matters and shut down, if we're going to be able to have some patriots wrangle together and buy Infowars so that we can stay on the air and they keep Alex Jones as CEO and they keep all the crew and some miraculous turn of events akin to what happens at the end of Star Wars with the Death Star exploding and Han Solo coming back just in the nick of time to make it possible.
[00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:36.170]  We're hoping for a miracle.
[00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:44.630]  We're praying for a miracle. We've seen several miracles this campaign season, especially with Donald Trump surviving what seems to be assassination attempt after assassination attempt.
[00:49:44.769 --> 00:49:52.690]  But in the event that no miracle occurs next month on November 13th and we are shut down by the leftist forces.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:50:05.340]  That want to conglomerate all political power into one New World Order, one world government, then the Alex Jones story is absolutely imperative to keeping Alex Jones on the air in one way or the other.
[00:50:06.199 --> 00:50:09.960]  Alex Jones operating broadcasting every single day because we're not going to take any time off.
[00:50:10.099 --> 00:50:11.559]  We're not going to skip a beat.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:17.539]  We are going to start broadcasting immediately after the leftists attempt to shut down this network.
[00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:19.230]  And I'm looking at the desk.
[00:50:19.409 --> 00:50:24.909]  It's amazing how many incredible articles have come out just since the war room on Friday afternoon.
[00:50:25.469 --> 00:50:28.570]  But I'm seeing Infowars banners all across all these.
[00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:32.409]  Because I pretty much exclusively cover Infowars articles when I host.
[00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:34.409]  And they just say Infowars, Infowars, Infowars.
[00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:40.550]  And how next month, the leftists want to make it illegal for us to even use the name Infowars.
[00:50:40.869 --> 00:50:42.170]  It's plastered over everything.
[00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:49.590]  We've always given away all of our broadcasts free, fair use, rebroadcast anywhere, no charge, upload the clips, download the clips.
[00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:59.630]  We don't care. We never file any copyright infringement, and they're trying to take away that which we have given the American people for decades, that which we have given humanity itself for decades.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:04.659]  They are trying to take it away, so please go to thealexjonesstore.com right now.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.199]  Incredible fundraiser shirts.
[00:51:06.659 --> 00:51:12.400]  Optimal Human, which is an incredible powdered green that you can mix into any water and drink and get all your vitamins every single day.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:18.539]  We've got the capsule version of the sea moss, an incredible source of natural iodine that will blow you away.
[00:51:18.659 --> 00:51:23.119]  Please go to thealexjonesstore.com right now and give the middle finger to the New World Order, please.
[00:51:23.639 --> 00:51:24.699]  More on the other side.
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:47.619]  A recent video going viral shows Israel's finance minister saying that the Jewish state must extend into Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.880]  But he's been saying this for over a year.
[00:51:50.179 --> 00:51:58.460]  Look, the Jordanians, for starters, did not like the statement, but even less the setting of the stage, with Smotic giving the statement.
[00:52:00.019 --> 00:52:11.949]  He gave the address on the podium was a map of Greater Israel that includes parts of modern-day Jordan and that's what got Amman to blast the statement.
[00:52:12.449 --> 00:52:22.010]  They said that Smotrich's actions constituted an act of reckless incitement as well as a violation of international norms and the peace agreement between Israel and Jordan.
[00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:37.170]  The Deputy Speaker of Jordanian Parliament took it a step further Calling on the Jordanian military to quote, take up arms and saying that all options should be on the table for Jordan given the extremist statements.
[00:52:37.989 --> 00:52:42.389]  Some Israeli soldiers wear the greater Israel patch on their uniforms.
[00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:51.710]  Many Israelis believe it is prophesied by God, and the radical American prophecy Christians agree.
[00:52:51.989 --> 00:53:03.889]  But what I'm saying is I believe eventually our borders will extend from Lebanon to the Great Desert, which is Saudi Arabia, and then from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates.
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.659]  And who's on the other side of the Euphrates?
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:08.179]  The Kurds. And the Kurds are our friends.
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:16.019]  So we have the Mediterranean behind us, the Kurds in front of us, Lebanon, which really needs the umbrella of protection of Israel.
[00:53:16.579 --> 00:53:22.980]  And then we're going to take, I believe, we're going to take Mecca, Medina and Mount Sinai and purify those places.
[00:53:23.179 --> 00:53:24.760]  You know, it's going to happen.
[00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:31.750]  Ukrainian President Zelensky has said that he wants his country to become a big Israel.
[00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:43.070]  And while young Ukrainians are sacrificed for the U.S. State Department war with Russia, Jewish settlers from Israel are setting up homes in their place.
[00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:59.409]  We are told that Israel is defending themselves from Hamas, but a leaked telegram from Israel states that Hamas served as a useful countergroup against the PLO. In 2019, Benjamin Netanyahu said,
[00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:08.230]  anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas.
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:23.960]  The CIA, MI6, Mossad, and their intelligence counterparts have a long history of fostering terrorist groups and using them as the boogeyman to sell nonstop illegal wars in the Middle East.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:32.260]  And do not forget that after 9-11, the United States Department of Defense planned on invading seven countries.
[00:54:32.539 --> 00:54:37.300]  I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the joint staff who used to work for me.
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.519]  And one of the generals called me in.
[00:54:38.539 --> 00:54:40.340]  He said, sir, you got to come in.
[00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:41.840]  You got to come in and talk to me a second.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.519]  I said, well, you're too busy. He said, no, no.
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:48.260]  He says, we've made the decision we're going to war with Iraq.
[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:50.760]  This was on or about the 20th of September.
[00:54:51.639 --> 00:54:53.320]  I said, we're going to war with Iraq.
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:57.289]  Why? He said, I don't know.
[00:54:58.190 --> 00:55:03.789]  So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan.
[00:55:03.989 --> 00:55:05.530]  I said, are we still going to war with Iraq?
[00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:07.070]  And he said, oh, it's worse than that.
[00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:23.750]  He said, I just got this down from upstairs, meeting the Secretary of Defense Office today, and he said, this is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off Iran.
[00:55:24.809 --> 00:55:36.170]  Israel and the United States continue to bomb Lebanon, murdering countless civilians, shooting young children in the head, and pushing closer to a war with Iran.
[00:55:36.489 --> 00:55:40.530]  A war that will inevitably pull Russia into the conflict.
[00:55:41.519 --> 00:55:44.880]  Why this is all happening is not entirely clear.
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:51.300]  But the late naval intelligence whistleblower, William Cooper, believed that he knew the answer.
[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:57.500]  Israel was created as the instrument to bring about the battle of Armageddon and the fulfillment of prophecy.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:06.400]  A war that will be so terrible, where nuclear weapons will be used, so that the American citizens and the other people in the world will get down on their knees and beg for no more war.
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.539]  And what is the answer to that?
[00:56:08.079 --> 00:56:17.679]  They're going to be told the only way we can guarantee no more war is if we destroy the sovereignty of nations and we come together as one humanity in a one-world government.
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:21.320]  Right. Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:28.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is The Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:33.559]  I am your host this evening, Chase Geyser, for the next two hours and 54 minutes.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:39.420]  We are going to be covering the news, breaking down all of the headlines, all of the cliffs, and taking your calls in the final hour.
[00:56:39.619 --> 00:56:43.440]  Open lines as always, so keep those phones close by.
[00:56:44.159 --> 00:56:45.619]  Dial in in two hours.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.880]  We've got this breaking news from today.
[00:56:48.239 --> 00:56:49.820]  Assassination attempt number three.
[00:56:50.539 --> 00:56:55.820]  Armed man who said he wanted to kill the president arrested outside Trump's Coachella rally.
[00:56:56.969 --> 00:57:01.769]  A couple of main quotes from that article by the great Jamie White on Infowars.com.
[00:57:01.949 --> 00:57:07.750]  Quote, we arrested a man trying to get in the perimeter with two firearms who ended up saying he was going to kill the president.
[00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:13.550]  We probably stopped another assassination attempt, says Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco.
[00:57:14.070 --> 00:57:21.969]  The arrest occurred in wake of two previous alleged assassination attempts on former President Trump, but suspect already released from custody on $5,000 bail.
[00:57:23.269 --> 00:57:33.659]  Unbelievable. An armed man was arrested Saturday outside former President Donald Trump's MAGA rally in Coachella, California, after he allegedly said he wanted to kill the president.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:43.400]  Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco told the Epoch Times that his department arrested a man who was in possession of two firearms outside the perimeter of Trump's event in Coachella, 130 miles east of Los Angeles.
[00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:50.769]  Saying again, we arrested a man trying to get in the perimeter with two firearms who ended up saying that he was going to kill the president.
[00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:58.530]  Bianco told the outlet, adding, the individual was carrying fraudulent VIP and media passes at the rally checkpoint.
[00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:04.630]  And they say this is the third attempt, but we know it's the fourth if we count what happened in Tucson.
[00:58:04.909 --> 00:58:22.590]  I don't want to beat a dead horse or belabor the point, but the fact of the matter is the leftists, the Democrats, the globalists have failed the American people so abundantly over the course of the last several years that the population of the American nation has become abundantly populist.
[00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:29.010]  In and of itself, it realizes that our problems are no longer right versus left, but the people versus the political class.
[00:58:29.289 --> 00:58:35.090]  And so they have to resort to assassinating their political opponents because they cannot beat them in fair elections.
[00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:41.650]  They can't even beat them in rigged elections because support for Donald Trump is officially too big to rig.
[00:58:42.590 --> 00:58:45.650]  It's just too big to rig.
[00:58:45.869 --> 00:58:46.889]  And we have them admitting this.
[00:58:46.969 --> 00:58:48.409]  We're going to show you clip number 27 here in a moment.
[00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:50.869]  This is not a good sign.
[00:58:50.989 --> 00:58:54.869]  Mar rips Dems for using Tim Walz to connect with black male voters.
[00:58:55.250 --> 00:59:07.349]  Let's run clip number 27 and then I'll show you example after example after example of leftists freaking out as this election comes to a head with just a little over three weeks until the fate of America and humanity is decided.
[00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:13.849]  Clip number 27. It's 25 days before the election, and I gotta say, it's not looking that great for the Democrats.
[00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:18.289]  I mean, this is not a good sign, you know, when you have an African-American candidate.
[00:59:18.389 --> 00:59:23.190]  You probably shouldn't be having to shore up your support among black men, but that's what's going on.
[00:59:23.289 --> 00:59:28.530]  Tim Walz is headlining a voter engagement event tonight with black men.
[00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:32.590]  Who better to connect with young black men than Tim Walz?
[00:59:37.759 --> 00:59:40.739]  Because apparently Michael Buble was unavailable.
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:51.000]  Meanwhile, Kim Kardashian's like, hello.
[00:59:54.739 --> 00:59:59.659]  But... No, Obama even came out yesterday to scold.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.659]  I mean, he was scolding.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:05.820]  Well, I don't know. In the last month of the convention, he was no scolding.
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:10.710]  Now he's scolding. He was saying, you've got to vote for Harris.
[01:00:10.849 --> 01:00:14.550]  But of course, for some young, especially the younger black men, it's a tough choice.
[01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:17.989]  Harris is African-American, but Trump has a sneaker line.
[01:00:19.929 --> 01:00:21.590]  Yeah, they really dropped the ball.
[01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:22.969]  They really dropped the ball.
[01:00:23.269 --> 01:00:28.889]  In their efforts, I'm going to show you some clips of some black men analyzing some of the Kamala Harris campaign stuff going on here.
[01:00:28.949 --> 01:00:30.789]  But let's just get through this Bill Maher stuff.
[01:00:30.849 --> 01:00:31.929]  I want to show you clip number 38.
[01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:33.949]  Maher mocking Kamala's media blitz.
[01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:36.809]  She went to places where the ass is pre-kissed.
[01:00:36.969 --> 01:00:38.170]  Let's watch clip number 38.
[01:00:40.409 --> 01:00:48.030]  Okay, so I was mentioning in the monologue, there's some sobering statistics for the Democrats this week about the election, which is only a little over three weeks away.
[01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:50.510]  I'm taking this from Andrew Sullivan's column.
[01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:58.389]  He says, at this point in 2020, Biden, with far fewer resources than Harris has, was 10 points ahead of Trump.
[01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:01.190]  And in 2016, Hillary was six up.
[01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:03.909]  And she is only 2.6 up.
[01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:07.309]  Pennsylvania, Biden was up 7 at this point.
[01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:09.050]  She's up 1.
[01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:12.349]  Michigan, Biden was up 8, and she's tied.
[01:01:12.909 --> 01:01:15.510]  Now, we're all in our bubbles, okay?
[01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:21.510]  And that's one reason I'm glad you're here, because a lot of people are saying, I don't care about any of this.
[01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:24.030]  How could anyone think about voting for Trump?
[01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:25.550]  And that's why you're here, Buck. Thank you.
[01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.630]  And we're going to get to that.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.679]  But it does not seem like she is closing the deal.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.519]  This week she did a media blitz.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.340]  She went to Howard Stern and Stephen Colbert and The View.
[01:01:39.159 --> 01:01:42.820]  Places where, you know, I would say the ass is pre-kissed.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.300]  Am I wrong?
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:02:01.800]  No. And while she's doing the view in some podcast called Call Me Daddy or something like that, and these other just favorable placements, even 60 Minutes she probably thought was favorable.
[01:02:02.199 --> 01:02:07.519]  While she's doing all these friendly outlets, she's bombing there, looking like she's totally dropping the ball.
[01:02:07.619 --> 01:02:10.500]  It's obnoxious. She's reading a teleprompter when she's on Oprah.
[01:02:10.739 --> 01:02:15.500]  It's unbelievably disgusting how incompetent and lacking of just utter talent.
[01:02:15.869 --> 01:02:17.590]  This woman is running for office.
[01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:23.349]  It's no wonder that she's losing in the polls and they still have to say that she's winning in the polls even though the numbers are way down.
[01:02:23.449 --> 01:02:36.639]  I mean we saw how close the election was close quote in 2020 and by all of the 2020 standards Kamala Harris is just getting absolutely murdered politically, metaphorically here.
[01:02:36.739 --> 01:02:40.300]  She is murdered in the polls, way less popular than Biden.
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:43.119]  We know there's going to be a lower turnout than 2020.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:47.639]  It's very likely that there's going to be a lower voter turnout than 2020 because that was in the middle of this...
[01:02:47.659 --> 01:03:08.179]  We're good to go.
[01:03:09.989 --> 01:03:22.630]  persuading voters to not care about a word that she says or not be enthusiastic about her policies whatsoever between amnesty and ads like this clip number 19 I think it's pretty obvious that she just sucks.
[01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:27.130]  Let's watch clip number 19 here in this cringe new Kamala ad begging men to vote for a woman.
[01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:30.969]  I'm a man. I'm a man.
[01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:32.190]  I'm a man, man.
[01:03:32.389 --> 01:03:36.070]  I'm man enough. I'm man enough to enjoy a barrel-proof bourbon.
[01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:38.510]  Neat. Man enough to cook my steak rare.
[01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:42.550]  Man enough to deadlift 500 and braid the s*** out of my daughter's hair.
[01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:44.489]  You think I'm afraid to rebuild a carburetor?
[01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:46.030]  I eat carburetors for breakfast.
[01:03:46.369 --> 01:03:48.630]  I ain't afraid of bears. That's what bear hugs are for.
[01:03:48.949 --> 01:03:51.230]  I'll tell you another thing I sure as s*** am not afraid of.
[01:03:52.489 --> 01:03:54.210]  Women. I'm not afraid of women.
[01:03:54.369 --> 01:03:55.409]  I'm not afraid of women.
[01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:56.769]  They want to control their bodies?
[01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:58.110]  I say go for it.
[01:03:58.269 --> 01:03:59.730]  They want to use IVF to start a family?
[01:03:59.989 --> 01:04:01.150]  I'm not afraid of families.
[01:04:02.929 --> 01:04:10.010]  Well, I hope she has the guts to look me right in the eye and accept my full-throated endorsement.
[01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:11.710]  Because I'm man enough to support women.
[01:04:11.989 --> 01:04:14.489]  You just described Kamala Harris as full-throated.
[01:04:14.489 --> 01:04:17.769]  I'm man enough to admit I'm lost even when I refuse to ask for directions.
[01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:21.210]  Man enough to not ban young women from reading Little Women.
[01:04:23.469 --> 01:04:25.349]  I'm man enough to raw dog a flight.
[01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:26.869]  It sucked. What?
[01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:30.210]  Not worth it. I'm man enough to be emotional in front of my wife.
[01:04:30.469 --> 01:04:32.250]  In front of my kids. In front of my horse.
[01:04:32.989 --> 01:04:36.110]  What? I'm man enough to tell you that I cry at Love Actually.
[01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:37.949]  Good Will Hunting. West Side Story.
[01:04:38.469 --> 01:04:44.960]  And Predator. I'm sick of so-called men domineering, belittling, and controlling women just so they can feel more power.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.119]  This is my first time watching this video.
[01:04:46.119 --> 01:04:47.280]  That's not how my mama raised me.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.139]  I love women. I love women who support their families.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.039]  Women who decide not to have families.
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:55.179]  Women who take charge. And I'm man enough to help them win.
[01:04:57.469 --> 01:05:00.869]  You know, there's somebody in my neighborhood that actually has a Harris Waltz sign out in their yard.
[01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:04.849]  And I'm not a leftist, so I'm not going to vandalize or destroy that sign.
[01:05:04.889 --> 01:05:15.789]  I don't believe in that. I'm just going to put a Trump sign out in my yard and defend it to the lawful extent of the law here in Texas, which means if anybody touches it, I'm going to shoot them in the face.
[01:05:16.769 --> 01:05:23.170]  But... It's just so infuriating after you see ads like that, clips like that, statements like this.
[01:05:23.429 --> 01:05:32.989]  All this evidence, headline after headline, stack after stack, article after article of how incompetent and evil and corrupt and just stupid, abundantly dangerously stupid these people are.
[01:05:33.110 --> 01:05:39.510]  When you see a sign out in somebody's yard that supports it, somebody in your neighborhood, somebody of your socioeconomic status that should know better.
[01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:45.690]  Probably college educated, probably successful, probably a house with two working professionals.
[01:05:45.869 --> 01:05:47.869]  I mean, these are people that are not supposed to be stupid.
[01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:55.670]  These are people that are supposed to have IQs above 100, making the abundantly stupid decision to support Harris-Waltz.
[01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:57.429]  I just cannot believe it.
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:07.820]  And even more frustrating than seeing a cringe ad like that and then support for Kamala Harris is seeing clip number 26 here where Harris pledges amnesty for millions.
[01:06:08.219 --> 01:06:18.440]  We understand now that the reason they left the border completely open is so that over 20 million people can come into this country so they can be shipped to swing states like Ohio.
[01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:37.469]  And then so that if the Democrats win this election cycle, they can grant amnesty to these 20 million people and then just initiate, manifest the fact that the United States of America will then become a one-party state indefinitely until total collapse and then civil war, whether it's in 10 years or 100 years from now.
[01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:38.789]  Is that what they want?
[01:06:38.889 --> 01:06:40.449]  I mean, unbelievable. Watch clip 26.
[01:06:42.369 --> 01:06:44.369]  So my pledge to you...
[01:06:45.079 --> 01:07:00.599]  Is that by the grace of God, and hopefully with your support as well, when I am elected president, I will bring back that border security bill, and I will sign it into law, and do the work of focusing on what we must do,
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:14.599]  the orderly and humane pathway to earn citizenship, and one of the biggest You know, I thought since 1933 a brown suit was taboo.
[01:07:15.659 --> 01:07:26.840]  Unbelievable. And that is, again, that is one of the priorities for me, frankly, in terms of my motivation for what I know we must do.
[01:07:27.719 --> 01:07:29.219]  And I think it's...
[01:07:30.909 --> 01:07:38.889]  I think it should compel us to agree they should not have to live in fear but should have an ability to be on a pathway to earn their citizenship.
[01:07:39.210 --> 01:07:40.449]  So it is one of my priorities.
[01:07:42.369 --> 01:07:43.929]  Absolutely disgusting. I mean, they admit it.
[01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:46.550]  They don't even try to hide it anymore, as Alex Jones says.
[01:07:46.849 --> 01:07:48.030]  They're not even trying to cover it up.
[01:07:48.150 --> 01:08:06.829]  I remember a time in the United States of America where our corrupt politicians, our supervillains, were so competent, so good at their supervillainy that they actually did cover their tracks, that they lied so well that you had the benefit of the doubt and you couldn't really pin down what they were doing with certainty because it was just an odicum,
[01:08:06.909 --> 01:08:10.010]  a modicum of doubt as to what they were really doing.
[01:08:11.309 --> 01:08:17.949]  But now we've arrived at this place in our politics where the supervillains don't even try to cover up what they are doing.
[01:08:18.069 --> 01:08:21.329]  They don't even do what they're doing in the name of some noble cause.
[01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:28.430]  I mean, at least Hitler, as evil as he was, claimed that he was trying to do what was in the best interest of Germany.
[01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:35.229]  Turns out he was wrong and millions upon millions of Germans died and they totally lost everything in World War II. Turns out they did terrible things.
[01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:43.689]  Stalin, evil as he was, did what he was doing in the name of this collectivist ideal of communism for the sake of the working class people of Russia.
[01:08:43.949 --> 01:08:45.689]  Turns out he was an evil bastard too.
[01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:48.130]  Turns out, yeah, millions upon millions of people died.
[01:08:48.730 --> 01:09:06.310]  Mao! Turns out he was evil, after all, with 50 million people killed in the Great Leap Forward between 1958 and 1962, but at least he did it in the name of industrializing China and bringing China into the future so that it wouldn't become some moot talking point of some history lesson.
[01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:10.569]  But now we have these Democrats leading our country.
[01:09:10.649 --> 01:09:14.850]  They're not even coming out in the name of some real good, in the name of some greater good.
[01:09:14.909 --> 01:09:18.310]  They're just saying things like, yes, we want to take away your guns.
[01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:20.550]  We don't believe that you have a Second Amendment right.
[01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:27.569]  And we want to amend the Constitution so that you don't have freedom of speech because it turns out freedom of speech is really just getting in the way of democracy.
[01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:36.250]  And when the Supreme Court doesn't agree with us, we just want to expand the Supreme Court so that we can water it down with leftist judges and make it rule in our favor from now on.
[01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:51.649]  And we also want to open up the borders entirely so there's no national sovereignty and then grant all of the invaders citizenship when they come in so they vote for us and there's never any representation of half of America ever again, the half that we don't like ever again in the future of the United States of America.
[01:09:51.770 --> 01:10:01.789]  I mean, they're just telling you how evil they are right before your eyes while the media in clip number 37 just weeps and cries that Gen Z doesn't support them.
[01:10:01.909 --> 01:10:09.920]  It's unbelievable. Watch. I had thought that Trump's debate performance would disqualify him.
[01:10:10.359 --> 01:10:24.800]  Then in the end, looking at the two candidates side by side, which the American people have been waiting weeks and months to see, that just as Biden's performance cost him the nomination, that Trump's performance would cost him the election.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.960]  And I've had to walk that back a little bit because I think the race is dead even.
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:32.539]  I don't find the national numbers at all.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.060]  It's the seven states.
[01:10:34.319 --> 01:10:37.720]  And in every one of those seven states, it's within the margin of error.
[01:10:37.939 --> 01:10:39.800]  In fact, it's half the margin of error.
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:51.340]  So there's no way to call it right now, which is why these 4% — and that's it — these 4% races are impossible to predict.
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.180]  Now, they could all go for Harris.
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.439]  They could all go for Trump.
[01:10:54.909 --> 01:10:58.770]  But I'm questioning whether these undecided voters are even going to participate.
[01:10:59.050 --> 01:11:00.189]  I know you're going to play some sound.
[01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:05.329]  But make no mistake, we are on a pin's edge right now.
[01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:14.649]  And the essential key point of this is that who they vote for is the next president of the United States.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:25.079]  So, Frank, let's listen to what some of the focus group participants had to say about why they are still undecided.
[01:11:26.579 --> 01:11:31.840]  Raise your hand if you are undecided still at this point.
[01:11:34.329 --> 01:11:47.270]  If the election were held today, who would you vote for if you had to pick, if the election were held today, between Trump, Harris, a write-in, and not voting?
[01:11:48.369 --> 01:11:50.869]  Yeah, I think I'm going to vote for Kamala Harris.
[01:11:51.029 --> 01:12:00.470]  I just can't get over what happened in 2020 and what's been reaffirmed in the debates and the general statements made during the campaign.
[01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:05.449]  Not just the riot, but the alternative slate of elector schemes is a bridge too far for me.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:13.420]  Angelo, just if you can ask briefly, you've been a little bit leaning Harris, and I know tonight you raised some concerns.
[01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:16.579]  Why are you in the right-end camp right now?
[01:12:17.479 --> 01:12:24.779]  In my opinion, the more I look back into it, the more I watch the debate, the more I look into her campaign, I cannot trust her.
[01:12:25.359 --> 01:12:30.479]  I'm not going to vote for Trump, but the more I think about it, the more I just don't know if I can vote for Harris.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:31.779]  I just do not trust her.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.340]  I'm more inclined to write someone who I feel like would best represent me through my vote.
[01:12:35.789 --> 01:12:36.989]  Aisha, how about you?
[01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:40.369]  Raise your hand. If you had to vote today for Harris, why Harris?
[01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:47.270]  I just want to see what she will do because I know she's going to have to run again later.
[01:12:47.869 --> 01:12:52.909]  So I'm hoping she will be an exemplary president for this term.
[01:12:53.109 --> 01:12:54.630]  That's my only reason. Okay.
[01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:56.930]  And Abigail, how about you?
[01:12:58.789 --> 01:13:17.840]  Some people said some things tonight that motivated me to do a little bit more research about Well,
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:23.020]  the fact she's thinking she's going to have children means that she's probably going to vote for Donald Trump.
[01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:29.250]  Okay, so first of all, we thank everybody for participating.
[01:13:29.609 --> 01:13:33.930]  Absolutely no bad things to say about people who participate in these conversations.
[01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:35.890]  Right before she says bad things about it.
[01:13:36.710 --> 01:13:39.890]  But does anybody at this table need to take a deep breath?
[01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:42.229]  Because I do. I just do.
[01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:46.590]  We've been listening to Undecided for weeks on TUA. So they're freaking out.
[01:13:46.869 --> 01:13:48.130]  This is the point of the whole clip.
[01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:51.470]  I don't want to, you know, torture you.
[01:13:52.489 --> 01:13:55.350]  With clips from MSNBC any more than absolutely necessary.
[01:13:55.689 --> 01:14:07.810]  Not only is it terribly insulting how inaccurate they are in the reporting of virtually everything, but it adds insult to injury how boring they are about it too.
[01:14:08.029 --> 01:14:13.029]  I mean, it's just sad, washed up pundits with their...
[01:14:14.359 --> 01:14:18.380]  Perfect hair, I guess it's supposed to be perfect, and then their corny suit.
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:33.439]  There's something about the whole aesthetic of mainstream media that just insults me as an American because they don't even try to be cool in any way, shape, or form, or original in any way, shape, or form with their fake backdrops, and they drop a flag and a Capitol and a monument.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:36.899]  And then we got the landscapes on the other screen that doesn't even make any sense.
[01:14:36.979 --> 01:14:39.239]  What the hell is going on aesthetically?
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:46.680]  I can tell you right now that if we threw up a background like that before Alex Jones sat in this chair, he'd be like, what the hell is this behind me right now?
[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:56.039]  So when I watch these other shows, these other networks, I am particularly sensitive to some of the production decisions that are being made by people with absolutely no taste.
[01:14:57.399 --> 01:14:58.640]  I think it's Dave Rubin.
[01:14:58.739 --> 01:14:59.779]  He's a famous producer.
[01:15:00.850 --> 01:15:01.869]  Doesn't play any instruments.
[01:15:01.989 --> 01:15:03.989]  He's a guy that's kind of bald with a really long beard.
[01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:07.010]  He's done a bunch of cool records.
[01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:08.350]  I think he's worked with the Black Keys.
[01:15:08.689 --> 01:15:11.550]  He did a documentary with Rick Rubin.
[01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:13.310]  Thank you. Rick Rubin.
[01:15:13.949 --> 01:15:17.449]  He did a documentary where he listened to some old Beatles songs with Paul McCartney.
[01:15:18.090 --> 01:15:19.770]  And one time he was asked...
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:26.899]  How is it that you're able to produce all these amazing records even though you don't play any instruments?
[01:15:27.079 --> 01:15:28.159]  Please get this guy off the screen.
[01:15:28.399 --> 01:15:30.739]  It's distracting how dorky and lame he is.
[01:15:32.899 --> 01:15:34.060]  Thank you.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:36.939]  He said, I have good taste.
[01:15:37.119 --> 01:15:40.300]  I'm able to produce these great records because I have good taste.
[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:53.380]  And that's what bothers me so much about the Anderson Coopers and CNNs and MSNBCs is not only can they not play the instrument that is their job of speaking the truth of the news or reporting or broadcasting to the American people.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:56.960]  They can't play the instrument, but they also have just terrible taste.
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:14.239]  That's one of the reasons why I'm so proud to work here at InfoWars and why it's so bothersome to me that they're trying to shut it down is because regardless of what you think, About Infowars, whether you trust it or not, whether you think it's fake news or real news, whether you think Alex Jones is right about the future or just lying about everything, you have to admit,
[01:16:14.359 --> 01:16:16.380]  this is a pretty damn cool network.
[01:16:19.159 --> 01:16:28.979]  It's pretty awesome that over the course of the last 30 years, we were able to declare an information war on the establishment and up to this point, when?
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:32.560]  Really? I mean, we have woken way more people up than we have turned away.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:36.739]  They have to reach back 10 years to make claims about inaccuracies.
[01:16:38.539 --> 01:16:51.380]  Why is it that the mainstream media won't let the one thing Alice Jones may or may not have gotten wrong 10 years ago go when CNN got 10 things wrong one hour ago, when MSNBC got 10 things wrong one minute ago?
[01:16:52.630 --> 01:17:00.529]  When ABC, NPR, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, all these outlets, especially the Washington Post owned by Bezos, they're getting things wrong every single day.
[01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:07.430]  They're just blatantly lying in the polls every single day, but they can't let the one questionable judgment that Alex Jones made 10 years ago go.
[01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:08.729]  They just cannot let it go.
[01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:10.609]  Let me tell you something about Sandy Hook.
[01:17:10.729 --> 01:17:16.210]  Whatever you think about Sandy Hook, nobody's made more money off those dead kids than their lawyers and the parents.
[01:17:17.010 --> 01:17:19.510]  You wanna talk about exploiting dead kids for money?
[01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:21.210]  You wanna talk about it?
[01:17:21.369 --> 01:17:25.710]  Nobody has exploited those dead kids more than their parents and their parents' lawyers.
[01:17:25.909 --> 01:17:27.989]  I'm sorry, but that's the truth of the matter.
[01:17:28.069 --> 01:17:36.270]  If my kids die in a school shooting, God forbid, you better bet your ass I'm not gonna be suing anybody in the name of my dead kids so I can make $1.5 billion.
[01:17:37.029 --> 01:17:38.710]  Because I'm not a shitty person.
[01:17:38.909 --> 01:17:41.520]  I'm sorry. That's just how I feel about it.
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:44.880]  And there are guys here in the crew that have had babies this week.
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:46.239]  Harrison Smith is out.
[01:17:46.539 --> 01:17:50.380]  Wilson is out right now on paternity leave for the two weeks off they get with their new babies.
[01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:54.479]  There are members of this crew that are starting families right now.
[01:17:54.899 --> 01:17:56.779]  None of these lawyers seem to give a damn about them.
[01:17:56.859 --> 01:17:59.279]  They just want to shut it down and try to render everybody unemployed.
[01:17:59.739 --> 01:18:00.960]  Is that what they want to do? Fine.
[01:18:02.029 --> 01:18:07.250]  I tell you what, though, it doesn't do anything to dampen one's resolve when there's an attack on their family.
[01:18:07.329 --> 01:18:08.630]  In fact, it does quite the opposite.
[01:18:08.789 --> 01:18:18.550]  It catalyzes and inspires such a fire within the bellies of those who are under attack that there will be a reckoning the likeness of which these leftists have never seen.
[01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:22.050]  I swear to God, there will be a reckoning the likeness of which these leftists have never seen.
[01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:28.069]  If they shut this place down, I know that you will go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:36.770]  We're good to go.
[01:19:02.230 --> 01:19:04.170]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:06.329]  I am Chase Guy. I'm your host for the next...
[01:19:06.829 --> 01:19:14.010]  Two and a half hours. We're going to cover the news for the next one hour and 27 minutes, followed by a final hour of your calls and thoughts.
[01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:15.229]  I have so many clips to go over.
[01:19:15.289 --> 01:19:16.590]  Let's just go straight into Jon Stewart.
[01:19:16.689 --> 01:19:22.270]  If we're going to do late night television leftist coverage, we've got to bounce from Marr to Jon Stewart.
[01:19:22.489 --> 01:19:25.890]  Claims Americans don't need guns to protect their constitutional rights.
[01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:33.270]  This is clip number 24. Gun control and ultimately gun confiscation are foundational policies that the leftist movement revolves around or revolves around.
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:38.020]  Question is why? Why are they so desperate to violate the Bill of Rights and take firearms away?
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:49.899]  Let's watch clip number 24. But at least the Constitution remains intact and is there to ensure that we have the First Amendment.
[01:19:50.319 --> 01:19:54.659]  The Second Amendment is there to ensure that we have the First Amendment.
[01:19:58.979 --> 01:20:01.520]  Guns don't protect our free speech.
[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:07.380]  Our free speech is protected by the consent of the governed laid out through the Constitution.
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:10.359]  It's not based on the threat of violence.
[01:20:10.699 --> 01:20:12.140]  It's based on elections.
[01:20:12.739 --> 01:20:14.800]  Organizing referendums and judicial system.
[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:16.439]  Our social contract...
[01:20:16.810 --> 01:20:23.250]  Offers many, many avenues to remedy these issues and allows sides to be heard and adjudicated.
[01:20:23.710 --> 01:20:31.470]  Guns, from what I can tell, seem to mostly protect the speech of the people holding the gun.
[01:20:32.029 --> 01:20:34.869]  It's a tool of intimidation.
[01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:39.109]  And, if I may finish...
[01:20:39.109 --> 01:20:40.329]  Listen, mother...
[01:20:40.329 --> 01:20:41.390]  I'm not done!
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:53.079]  It is a tool of intimidation, and one that I think is actually being irresponsibly and recklessly invoked.
[01:20:53.869 --> 01:20:58.829]  Because some people in your crowd thought they might have been shadow banned by Facebook.
[01:20:59.149 --> 01:21:00.590]  I mean, for God's sakes!
[01:21:00.970 --> 01:21:04.229]  You guys are in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[01:21:04.829 --> 01:21:15.890]  The whole reason you're there is because some f***ing asshole with an AR-15 tried to permanently litigate his vision of this country's free speech.
[01:21:16.449 --> 01:21:17.649]  That's why you're there.
[01:21:17.909 --> 01:21:19.569]  The whole point of a society is...
[01:21:19.569 --> 01:21:24.850]  And the whole reason he wasn't successful is because someone else also had a rifle and stopped him.
[01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:27.390]  Are you dumb, Stuart?
[01:21:27.989 --> 01:21:29.210]  I mean, come on.
[01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:30.970]  Come on. Come on.
[01:21:31.569 --> 01:21:36.350]  And he's talking about, oh, last I checked, the person with the gun only gets to represent their free speech.
[01:21:36.449 --> 01:21:39.869]  The whole point of the Second Amendment is that everybody in the country can have a gun.
[01:21:40.090 --> 01:21:43.350]  So there isn't one person with a gun and another person without a gun.
[01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:45.649]  That's what happens when you take away the Second Amendment.
[01:21:45.789 --> 01:21:47.189]  Only the government has the guns.
[01:21:47.329 --> 01:21:49.390]  Then only their version of free speech is sexualized.
[01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:50.649]  How are you this stupid?
[01:21:50.810 --> 01:21:57.109]  How are you abundantly this foolish and myopic and just totally retarded, abundantly dangerously retarded?
[01:21:57.270 --> 01:22:06.590]  Jon Stewart. On late night television, reading other people's jokes, is now the bastion clarion call of free speech and constitutional interpretation, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:06.949 --> 01:22:08.869]  Welcome to the show, Jon Stewart.
[01:22:09.130 --> 01:22:10.890]  Welcome to America, Jon Stewart.
[01:22:10.989 --> 01:22:12.689]  You're such a hero with your insight.
[01:22:12.869 --> 01:22:18.590]  Because you're so popular and there's an audience that laughs when other people who are paid to be there hold up a sign that says, please, laugh.
[01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:22.069]  That means that the whole entire country should totally trust everything you say.
[01:22:22.359 --> 01:22:23.539]  Because there's social proof there.
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:25.840]  And if other people are laughing, then it must actually be funny.
[01:22:25.979 --> 01:22:33.460]  Then I'm going to sit with my Blue Bell ice cream and my fat wife and my stupid dog and my retarded kid and I'm going to scoop it up and I'm just going to laugh at my lazy boy.
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:38.920]  I'm just going to laugh at my lazy boy as I watch Jon Stewart tell me how much he doesn't want me to have a gun.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.520]  It's so funny the way he says it and how much free speech only matters if it's protecting leftist ideology.
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:49.560]  It's just so funny to see Jon Stewart up there because he's just so brilliant and clever and funny and talented and popular.
[01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:52.609]  What is this? What is this?
[01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:54.930]  High school again? What is this?
[01:22:55.029 --> 01:22:57.529]  Come on. Nobody's watching this crap, are they?
[01:22:57.630 --> 01:22:58.750]  Are they actually watching this?
[01:22:59.010 --> 01:23:00.250]  Are there millions of people tuning in?
[01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:11.720]  Because last I checked, How many millions upon millions of people listen to Donald Trump on an ex-space with Elon Musk versus watched any of the debates on any of the mainstream media networks?
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:17.520]  How many people are tuning in to Comedy Central or whatever damn network The Late Show is on?
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:20.279]  I don't even know if that's what it's called. Is it called The Late Show or The Late Night Show?
[01:23:21.159 --> 01:23:26.779]  All I see are clips of Marr and clips of Jon Stewart and clips of Stephen Colbert because people only watch the clips.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:27.899]  Nobody watches the show.
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:29.939]  They have to pay people to be there in the audience.
[01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:36.409]  Maybe they're big enough that an audience actually signs up and buys tickets, but they have to pay people to hold up signs to tell the audience what to do.
[01:23:37.489 --> 01:23:45.270]  It's just absolutely disgusting to me that we give these people any sort of credibility or weight or credence.
[01:23:45.390 --> 01:23:51.430]  Like there's some sort of fashion sayer or seer of what the future should behold for us.
[01:23:51.489 --> 01:23:52.850]  Like they have any sort of a vision.
[01:23:53.050 --> 01:24:00.270]  Like just because we put them on a pedestal means that they can see farther into the future than the rest of us because they're so high up in the altitude that we have placed them.
[01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:01.750]  It's absolutely disgusting to me.
[01:24:01.810 --> 01:24:02.989]  It's totally a joke.
[01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:06.560]  It is disgusting. Some sort of weird cancer.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:17.359]  It's malignant. Just spreading through our entire culture, our entire species until everyone just catches the level of retard that is purveyed from behind the microphone of that dork.
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.260]  He's actually a dork.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.039]  He hasn't done anything good since Big Daddy.
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:25.239]  Wasn't he in Big Daddy? He was the guy that actually had the kid.
[01:24:25.399 --> 01:24:30.439]  That was pretty funny. But it's just, I don't know where to go with this.
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:32.020]  I don't know what to tell you guys.
[01:24:33.279 --> 01:24:35.060]  At least black men are finally waking up.
[01:24:35.159 --> 01:24:42.140]  At least the black community, the minority community, is realizing that the Democratic Party has only lied about caring about any of their interests forever.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:25:01.100]  And despite the fact that they've elected black mayor, black governor, black mayor, black governor, black senator, black representative, over and over again, democratic, democratic, democratic, over and over again, realized now, finally has realized, this community has realized that, oh my god, the people that we have been electing to represent us in office have not been representing us whatsoever.
[01:25:01.319 --> 01:25:06.600]  In fact, they've been selling us out and they want to perpetuate our problems because our problems are their platform.
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:10.119]  They're not creative enough to solve a problem and then pivot to a new platform.
[01:25:10.159 --> 01:25:13.079]  They want to just maintain this platform that's always been working for them.
[01:25:13.119 --> 01:25:14.739]  They're trying to keep disco alive, folks.
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:16.939]  They're trying to keep depravity alive.
[01:25:17.039 --> 01:25:18.140]  Let's watch clip number 29 here.
[01:25:18.239 --> 01:25:21.460]  Watch. Black men slam Obama for talking down to them, telling them to vote.
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:22.979]  Kamala. Let's watch.
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:28.760]  Communities is that...
[01:25:31.869 --> 01:25:44.289]  We had not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running.
[01:25:46.949 --> 01:25:55.449]  Now, I also want to say that that seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.
[01:25:57.130 --> 01:26:00.670]  So if you don't mind, just for a second, I'm going to speak to y'all right now.
[01:26:03.499 --> 01:26:20.220]  And say that when you have a choice that is this clean, when on one hand you have somebody who grew up like you,
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:32.529]  knows you, went to college with you, understands the struggles Look at that packed Barack Obama rally.
[01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:37.729]  Pain and joy that comes from those experiences.
[01:26:39.409 --> 01:26:55.449]  He said to work harder and do more and overcome and achieves the second highest office in the land.
[01:26:56.399 --> 01:26:58.060]  Hello America and hello Georgia.
[01:26:58.399 --> 01:27:02.060]  I'm Vernon Jones, former state representative from the great state of Georgia.
[01:27:02.399 --> 01:27:04.840]  And I'm out doing my normal morning jog.
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:07.319]  By the way, it's a great day to be in Georgia.
[01:27:07.479 --> 01:27:08.560]  It's a beautiful fall day.
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:11.199]  But anyhow, I just had to pause for the cause.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:17.779]  I, like many of you, observed and listened and watched Barack Obama last night as he addressed black men.
[01:27:18.779 --> 01:27:22.960]  But as a black man, he did everything but address us.
[01:27:23.119 --> 01:27:25.760]  What he did He berated black men.
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.380]  He rebuked black men.
[01:27:27.779 --> 01:27:29.220]  He even scolded black men.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:37.239]  Primarily because we will not fall in line and vote for Madam Lockup, her brother, Kamala Harris, because that's her record.
[01:27:37.789 --> 01:27:44.189]  As if black men are too stupid that we can't vote our self-interest, what's best for us, our pocketbook, our families.
[01:27:44.529 --> 01:28:01.810]  As if we've been immune to the past three and a half years, as if we don't know that gas prices have been higher under Kamala Harris, food prices higher under Kamala Harris, interest rates on home mortgages higher under Kamala Harris, and runaway borders under Kamala Harris.
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.460]  But you know what? That's what the liberal white Democratic Party did.
[01:28:05.659 --> 01:28:11.439]  They dispatched Barack Obama out there to whip black men back on the plantation to vote Democrat.
[01:28:12.279 --> 01:28:18.840]  And you know, President Obama, he meant a lot to black people, but he didn't do anything for black people.
[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:28.039]  And for him to want to come down from his mansion in Martha's Vineyard and tell black men how we should vote, Really?
[01:28:28.039 --> 01:28:30.000]  You don't even live in Chicago anymore.
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:34.279]  You left your black community, Barack Obama, and you want to tell us how to vote?
[01:28:34.579 --> 01:28:35.659]  We're not having that.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:37.359]  And we're not voting for Kamala Harris.
[01:28:38.979 --> 01:28:45.420]  So I want you guys to think about the last couple of weeks and the attacks that have been aimed at black men.
[01:28:45.859 --> 01:28:49.939]  Now watch this. Not from white folk, but from other black men.
[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:59.920]  We got Magic Johnson, a black man, saying that black men should vote for Harris because that's the only acceptable choice.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:03.840]  This is a man who has a black son who thinks he's a woman.
[01:29:05.239 --> 01:29:13.079]  Then we have the 44th president of the United States coming out and saying that black men voting for Trump is unacceptable.
[01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:27.500]  He has the nerve to look in the eyes of black men who are out here working their off Grinding, taking care of their families, mature, responsible men, spiritually mature men, handling their business.
[01:29:28.159 --> 01:29:42.100]  This man that is worth, some estimates say, of $75 million, has then the audacity to tell these same black men that it is unacceptable for you to vote any other way than what I tell you.
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:47.220]  I'm just starting to think now, like, seriously, like, this is all the game.
[01:29:47.319 --> 01:29:48.699]  Like, this can't be serious, y'all.
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:51.359]  We're like in some twilight zone.
[01:29:51.539 --> 01:29:53.819]  We're just not, like, this ain't even real anymore.
[01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:58.539]  It's to the point to where it's become redundant and just useless to talk about.
[01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:05.420]  It's amazing to me how dumb and just how gullible that they think that we are.
[01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:08.220]  And the sad part is that many are just like that.
[01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:11.060]  It's really frustrating.
[01:30:12.939 --> 01:30:20.319]  Now, if a white man came out and told a black man that it's unacceptable for him to vote a certain way, black folks would be all up in arms.
[01:30:21.739 --> 01:30:22.859]  All up in arms.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.060]  You can't tell me that.
[01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:34.560]  I'm a grown... But then we allow another black man to come out and tell another black man, a grown black man, on top of that, that he can't do what he so desires.
[01:30:35.199 --> 01:30:40.750]  This is just... Listen, let me just say it like this.
[01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:46.229]  If there was a black man that was on the Republican side that was running for president, black folks still wouldn't vote for him.
[01:30:46.970 --> 01:30:50.270]  Black folks in a recent poll said that they wouldn't even vote for Condi Rice.
[01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:52.529]  Condi. They wouldn't even vote for her.
[01:30:53.229 --> 01:30:54.789]  They would vote for Harris over Condi.
[01:30:54.890 --> 01:31:00.510]  Can you believe that? Black, black, black folks said that they'd vote for Harris over Condi.
[01:31:00.630 --> 01:31:05.010]  What? Man, this stuff is just becoming ridiculous, y'all.
[01:31:05.109 --> 01:31:06.609]  This is just becoming ridiculous.
[01:31:07.689 --> 01:31:09.149]  This is just becoming ridiculous.
[01:31:09.409 --> 01:31:10.489]  This is just ridiculous.
[01:31:31.529 --> 01:31:33.689]  Why you don't f*** with her? Because she f*** with them immigrants.
[01:31:33.909 --> 01:31:35.550]  I'm black. So why you riding with Trump so much?
[01:31:35.710 --> 01:31:37.850]  Them Venezuelans taking all our bread.
[01:31:38.130 --> 01:31:41.409]  Hey, Trump or Kamala? Shit, Trump, be honest.
[01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:45.909]  Why Trump, though? He used to keep immigrants out, so, you know, we was able for us to get jobs.
[01:31:46.010 --> 01:31:48.970]  It's hard for us to get jobs now, shit, because immigrants taking over and s***.
[01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:51.649]  They do do it better than us, though, but they taking our s***.
[01:31:51.810 --> 01:31:53.130]  They do it better than us, though.
[01:31:53.310 --> 01:31:55.510]  You voting for Trump? Hell yeah, f*** Camilla, f***.
[01:31:55.630 --> 01:31:58.329]  I ain't even gonna lie. I'm not f***ing with her, her ass.
[01:32:02.109 --> 01:32:05.930]  What would make you want to vote for Kamala?
[01:32:06.789 --> 01:32:08.069]  We were the last two people on earth!
[01:32:19.050 --> 01:32:20.949]  I'm telling you, man, these people are wise.
[01:32:22.130 --> 01:32:24.270]  So you want to vote for a black woman?
[01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:25.729]  It's going to be the first black woman in office?
[01:32:25.930 --> 01:32:29.510]  Let me tell you something, man. Ain't no man is going to listen to no woman.
[01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:35.329]  There's no man. God, this is no woman.
[01:32:35.489 --> 01:32:39.770]  I mean, but we can make history. Man, we could, but it's not going to be history, bro.
[01:32:40.369 --> 01:32:43.130]  That's going to start World War III soon as she get in.
[01:32:43.369 --> 01:32:44.970]  Kamala Trump. She's right.
[01:32:45.029 --> 01:32:46.529]  He's right. Aw, come on, bro.
[01:32:47.069 --> 01:32:48.310]  Kamala till it's backwards, bro.
[01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:51.310]  Man, what are you talking about? Kamala, we voting for Trump, bro.
[01:32:51.310 --> 01:32:53.810]  What are you talking about? You know damn well we don't f*** for Kamala.
[01:32:53.970 --> 01:32:55.010]  Trump. Why, bro?
[01:32:55.149 --> 01:32:56.430]  Give our free stems and everything.
[01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:57.770]  You tweaking it. Yeah, that's how you feel.
[01:32:58.010 --> 01:32:59.569]  That's crazy. You tweaking it.
[01:32:59.590 --> 01:33:01.689]  I ain't going to lie, bro. I vote Kamala. Man, we f***.
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:20.420]  I'm about ready to have a conniption fit.
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:23.600]  Alex Jones this week used the term conniption fit.
[01:33:23.659 --> 01:33:25.899]  I saw it on his Twitter. I didn't even know what a conniption fit was.
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:27.220]  I had to look it up on ChatGPT.
[01:33:27.479 --> 01:33:28.779]  I'm about ready to have a conniption fit.
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:32.340]  Because that was the funniest video that I've ever seen in my entire life.
[01:33:32.439 --> 01:33:34.319]  And they're all absolutely right.
[01:33:35.039 --> 01:33:46.659]  The Democrats look down on them as this poor underbelly of civilization, as this meager part of our society with low IQ that we can just exploit forever and they'll always vote for us because they're just so dumb.
[01:33:47.199 --> 01:33:52.979]  They don't catch on if I use some of their vernacular when I speak to them at a rally in Georgia.
[01:33:54.409 --> 01:33:59.529]  Or if I suddenly sound Hispanic when I speak to a rally of Hispanic Democrats.
[01:34:00.970 --> 01:34:14.029]  Or if I suddenly sound Vietnamese, if I speak to a Vietnamese group, it's unbelievable the audacity of the Kamala Harris's, the Hillary Clinton's, who just say, you know, I ain't no Tammy Wynette, just standing by as my husband does whatever he wants.
[01:34:14.189 --> 01:34:18.710]  It's disgusting, the audacity of these people that they believe they can fool just everyone.
[01:34:18.909 --> 01:34:29.149]  Or they believe that just because people are poor and desperate or live in bad neighborhoods, that means that they're gullible and susceptible and vulnerable to just being fooled by utter evil depravity.
[01:34:29.359 --> 01:34:43.779]  It's not true. They understand that their lives are at stake, that freedom itself is at stake, and they understand now finally that the Democratic Party, neither the Republican Party as a party, give a damn about them, so they're voting for the only outsider, the only populist, Donald Trump.
[01:34:44.119 --> 01:34:45.960]  And here he is. We're going to write clip number 15 here.
[01:34:46.989 --> 01:34:52.569]  And we're going to break down the story, but Operation Aurora has announced Trump promises massive deportation of illegal criminals.
[01:34:52.789 --> 01:35:00.869]  Let's just get into some of his promises, some of the developments in the illegal immigration story that has impacted the black community so disproportionately in the United States of America.
[01:35:00.989 --> 01:35:09.369]  Clip number 15, and then run 16 of the sheriff endorsing him after that, and then 17 of the Aurora native gangs, and then we'll do 28 as well.
[01:35:09.449 --> 01:35:13.350]  So let's just run 15 through 17, and then 28 back-to-back, please.
[01:35:13.449 --> 01:35:16.750]  15. Walk in and tell them, get the hell out of your apartment.
[01:35:16.829 --> 01:35:17.909]  They took over complexes.
[01:35:18.250 --> 01:35:22.609]  And they have a radical left governor who's petrified.
[01:35:22.949 --> 01:35:25.109]  He doesn't want anything to do with it.
[01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:28.529]  He's afraid. He's chicken shit, okay?
[01:35:29.010 --> 01:35:31.909]  He's afraid. Amen.
[01:35:35.890 --> 01:35:40.449]  Here's the sheriff, Don Aurora, endorsing Donald Trump.
[01:35:40.710 --> 01:35:43.270]  ...the vulnerable immigrants from Frankfurt.
[01:35:47.679 --> 01:35:55.260]  And therefore, it was incumbent upon the rest of the Denver Metro area to deal with that aftermath.
[01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:58.479]  Some of these fighters are highly privileged.
[01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:07.520]  They're sex offenders, they're murderers, and they're members of transnational organizations, Charlie Trenaday on the line.
[01:36:11.499 --> 01:36:19.000]  A lot of women that support Trump, especially women who have kids, families, and what's going on in Aurora.
[01:36:19.399 --> 01:36:20.939]  I'm a native of Colorado.
[01:36:21.439 --> 01:36:22.760]  It's happening. It's real.
[01:36:22.899 --> 01:36:26.739]  It's here. And our governor says it's not real.
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:29.119]  It's real. It's not in our imagination.
[01:36:29.119 --> 01:36:32.119]  It's happening. What is it that you're saying that's real?
[01:36:32.319 --> 01:36:34.140]  The gangs, all that kind of stuff.
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:37.180]  It's everywhere. It's in Aurora.
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:40.500]  It's throughout the suburbs. They're spreading...
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:41.979]  Isn't that the scary part?
[01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:43.319]  I've been... Insane.
[01:36:44.479 --> 01:36:51.560]  I'm announcing today that upon taking office, we will have an Operation Aurora at the federal level.
[01:36:59.359 --> 01:37:02.500]  To expedite the removals of these savage gangs.
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:08.399]  And I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:11.880]  Think of that. 1798.
[01:37:12.079 --> 01:37:13.960]  This was put there. 1798.
[01:37:14.119 --> 01:37:15.560]  That's a long time ago, right?
[01:37:16.859 --> 01:37:22.380]  To target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil.
[01:37:22.819 --> 01:37:30.609]  Who would have ever thought that a president or a future president would ever have to Stand here and say such things.
[01:37:30.829 --> 01:37:33.050]  Who would think that that's even possible to have to do?
[01:37:33.710 --> 01:37:37.369]  So many things have changed in the last four years.
[01:37:37.670 --> 01:37:43.890]  But that's the state of our country now, after Kamala and Joe Biden have just absolutely destroyed our country.
[01:37:45.189 --> 01:37:48.250]  We're a country in tremendous distress.
[01:37:48.609 --> 01:37:49.789]  We're a failing country.
[01:37:49.850 --> 01:37:51.250]  We're laughed at all over the world.
[01:37:51.729 --> 01:38:04.850]  We will send elite squads of ICE, Border Patrol, and federal law enforcement officers to hunt down, arrest, and deport every last illegal alien gang member until there is not a single one left in this country.
[01:38:07.670 --> 01:38:19.510]  And if they come back into our country, They will be told it is an automatic 10-year sentence in jail with no possibility of parole.
[01:38:24.930 --> 01:38:34.630]  And I'm hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer.
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:44.859]  Strong, strong, strong.
[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:46.420]  Do you hear yourself?
[01:38:46.619 --> 01:38:47.920]  This is clip number one. We're going to run next.
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:51.020]  Vance humiliates ABC's Raditz.
[01:38:51.319 --> 01:38:57.279]  And I think it's appropriate that her name is Raditz because that was the very first villain in the Dragon Ball Z series, if you remember, crew.
[01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:02.260]  For claiming migrant gangs captured only a handful of apartment complexes.
[01:39:02.439 --> 01:39:08.659]  As if it's okay that migrant gangs have captured any apartment complexes in the United States of America.
[01:39:09.159 --> 01:39:12.359]  Oh, it was just a handful of people that were just forced out of their apartments.
[01:39:12.399 --> 01:39:18.119]  It's just a handful of apartment complexes that have been conquered by Venezuelan gangs as a result of this border policy.
[01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:24.520]  You're making it sound like it's such a big deal when it's only a handful of apartment complexes that have been conquered by foreign enemies.
[01:39:25.039 --> 01:39:26.779]  Unbelievable here. Watch clip number one.
[01:39:27.569 --> 01:39:39.409]  The incidents were limited to a handful of apartment complexes, and the mayor said our dedicated police officers had acted on those concerns.
[01:39:39.649 --> 01:39:41.050]  A handful of problems.
[01:39:42.619 --> 01:39:44.979]  Only, Martha, do you hear yourself?
[01:39:45.159 --> 01:39:53.859]  Only a handful of apartment complexes in America were taken over by Venezuelan gangs and Donald Trump is the problem and not Kamala Harris' open border.
[01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:58.460]  Americans are so fed up with what's going on and they have every right to be.
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:15.100]  And I really find this exchange Martha, sort of interesting because you seem to be more focused with nitpicking everything that Donald Trump has said rather than acknowledging that apartment complexes in the United States of America are being taken over by violent gangs.
[01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:19.899]  I worry so much more about that problem than anything else here.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.119]  We've got to get American communities in a safe space again.
[01:40:23.539 --> 01:40:28.520]  And unfortunately, when you let people in by the millions Most of whom are unvetted.
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:30.460]  Most of whom you don't know who they really are.
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:32.600]  You're going to have problems like this.
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:37.960]  Kamala Harris, 94 executive orders that undid Donald Trump's successful border policies.
[01:40:38.159 --> 01:40:39.800]  We knew this stuff would happen.
[01:40:39.859 --> 01:40:44.560]  They dragged about opening the border and now we have the consequences and we're living with it.
[01:40:44.659 --> 01:40:46.180]  We can do so much better.
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:49.979]  Unbelievable, folks. We know that freedom is under attack.
[01:40:50.119 --> 01:40:51.239]  We know America's under attack.
[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:52.460]  We know humanity's under attack.
[01:40:52.579 --> 01:40:53.640]  We know Alex is under attack.
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:57.920]  We know the crew is under attack by these evil globalist leftists.

[01:43:30.979 --> 01:43:33.039]  I'm down to my last few chips.
[01:43:34.170 --> 01:43:35.210]  It's like a video game.
[01:43:35.289 --> 01:43:41.109]  You're winning the last level, fighting the last boss, but you're on one life, quarter power, one more hit, you're blown up.
[01:43:41.449 --> 01:43:43.369]  I use the Rapplican analogy.
[01:43:43.789 --> 01:43:45.909]  I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but I like that movie.
[01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:48.409]  Some of the 60s shows I liked growing up as a kid.
[01:43:48.510 --> 01:43:49.970]  But the point is, it's all correct.
[01:43:50.170 --> 01:43:53.529]  That movie, where the ship, you know, the big weapon's about to go off.
[01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:56.689]  They're gonna get killed. They're trying to race away from the detonation of the Genesis Project.
[01:43:57.609 --> 01:44:01.670]  And Kirk says, Scotty, I need warp one in five minutes and we're all dead.
[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:04.279]  And that's not...
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:08.220]  Really the case. I mean, there's a lot of stuff lined up.
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:09.460]  It takes a lot of time to deal with.
[01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:11.579]  A lot of big groups want to come in and launch stuff.
[01:44:11.579 --> 01:44:14.199]  I've got to go through that. I've got to make sure they're not going to control what I say.
[01:44:14.659 --> 01:44:16.239]  We've got backups. We've got to...
[01:44:16.239 --> 01:44:17.600]  But it takes time to set that up.
[01:44:17.939 --> 01:44:19.500]  The person I trust the most is me.
[01:44:19.739 --> 01:44:23.920]  And Alex Jones sitting on no money, basically, and not having money to...
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:31.340]  I have to personally go in and pay for so they don't take my name, which is preposterous that they're trying, or the social media if they shut down InfoWars.
[01:44:31.619 --> 01:44:33.520]  I have to be able to hold them off like I've been doing.
[01:44:33.619 --> 01:44:34.699]  They got Giuliani in a year.
[01:44:34.739 --> 01:44:38.899]  I've been fighting them seven years. So, grace of God, you know, we're in the fight.
[01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:47.560]  But I've got to fight that and pay for the bankruptcy defense in the next few months, and it's conservatively $300,000.
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:52.960]  And you've got to sell a lot of t-shirts when you're only getting a few bucks per t-shirt yourself to pay for that.
[01:44:53.319 --> 01:44:54.479]  So they're great t-shirts.
[01:44:54.619 --> 01:45:02.829]  You need them. Thealexjonesstore.com Thealexjonesstore.com And a lot of folks are responding and I don't want to belabor here.
[01:45:03.149 --> 01:45:05.550]  But I belabored yesterday and we got big support.
[01:45:05.770 --> 01:45:08.770]  And it's nothing more frustrating than I have to just cover this to survive.
[01:45:09.989 --> 01:45:11.029]  But that's what I'm doing.
[01:45:11.149 --> 01:45:12.170]  They are great t-shirts.
[01:45:12.430 --> 01:45:14.510]  It's all there. Thealexjonesstore.com Separately.
[01:45:14.670 --> 01:45:20.579]  The sponsor. My dad's company, based right here in Central Texas, drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:29.640]  Great nano-silver products, great Next Level Financial Energy, Cabochill, Top Rain, Rocketrest Sleep A. You go there and like 70% of the stuff sold out.
[01:45:29.779 --> 01:45:30.979]  Because my dad's up against the wall.
[01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:32.779]  They've been attacking and going after him for two years.
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:34.939]  He spent basically everything he had on that.
[01:45:35.119 --> 01:45:42.899]  He put everything else he had in to get some staple products reordered and four new products that start coming in next week that are going to be great.
[01:45:42.979 --> 01:45:44.539]  So you go there and you're like, well, there's almost nothing here.
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:48.920]  Now we're up against the wall. So, go get what's there.
[01:45:49.199 --> 01:45:50.260]  Stuff that's left is all great.
[01:45:50.399 --> 01:45:52.560]  Silver Bullet, Financial Energy, Comet Shell.
[01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:56.819]  A lot of other stuff. There's still like more than a dozen items left.
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:57.960]  There was like 50 there before.
[01:45:58.439 --> 01:46:00.640]  And just get it and then you'll see the stuff come back.
[01:46:00.939 --> 01:46:02.979]  We're, we're, it's like farmers.
[01:46:04.119 --> 01:46:06.979]  They gotta have money to hold back to buy seed or save seed.
[01:46:08.939 --> 01:46:15.579]  DRJonesNaturals.com had to put everything in to get the next seeds to continue the cycle of funding our operation and my dad's operation funding us.
[01:46:16.789 --> 01:46:18.649]  So that's why you're like, well, there's almost nothing left here.
[01:46:18.750 --> 01:46:20.729]  It's all that we didn't have the money to buy more stuff.
[01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:21.890]  We didn't have money to buy more stuff.
[01:46:24.130 --> 01:46:26.350]  So we are up against the wall here.
[01:46:27.670 --> 01:46:30.310]  So I won't have to do this every show.
[01:46:31.369 --> 01:46:33.329]  If more than 1% go, you know what?
[01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:40.350]  I think I'm going to stand up for the country and myself in the future and support people that are obviously the top enemy of the globalists.
[01:46:40.350 --> 01:46:42.729]  It's a no-brainer. And I'm going to get great products in the process.
[01:46:42.989 --> 01:46:46.390]  It's just... But I get it.
[01:46:46.449 --> 01:46:47.970]  Most people, this is just a show.
[01:46:49.170 --> 01:46:50.569]  This is not a show, people.
[01:46:51.329 --> 01:46:57.270]  This is the defense of the future of our species that's having a big effect on the enemy.
[01:46:58.270 --> 01:47:01.069]  So I want to thank those that understood this and have bought the products and loved them.
[01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:03.770]  They've got like 4.7 star reviews.
[01:47:04.289 --> 01:47:07.449]  And I want to encourage those that haven't to go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:47:07.850 --> 01:47:10.649]  And then info or story. Anything you order, even if we get it shut down, it's all there.
[01:47:10.689 --> 01:47:16.569]  It won't be shut down for months. You know, if that's the case, because even if they sell it and bad guys get it, it'll take a few weeks, they say, to shut it down.
[01:47:16.649 --> 01:47:17.949]  So we're about two months out from the shutdown.
[01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:22.180]  So you'll get all your product at M4Shore.com.
[01:47:22.479 --> 01:47:27.460]  Vitamineral Fusion's back in stock for 40% off and so much more on M4Shore.com as well.
