[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.279]  So the outcome or the consequence, especially with what Putin said recently in his statement, everybody needs to go and listen to what he basically said.
[00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:24.699]  He said that there will be an action, there will be a consequence to this very provocative step that the West is taking, because Putin recognized immediately that That Ukraine can't handle these.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.100]  This is not a system in their inventory, nor is it a capability that they have.
[00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:38.780]  They have to use other means, meaning they have to use other countries to leverage the way that this weapon system can be used.
[00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.960]  So there is going to be a consequence.
[00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:06.079]  I don't know And instead of fighting for peace as Donald Trump, as President Trump has continued to say, what is happening is these people are taking us to war.
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:16.859]  Trump is going to have to get on the phone with world leaders now, and he's probably going to have to put himself into the president mode, even though there's, like we always say, there's only one president at a time.
[00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:20.939]  But Trump needs to say, we need to have cool heads prevail here.
[00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.260]  We cannot have these provocative measures taken.
[00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:26.840]  And I wrote about this in the paper as well.
[00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:38.069]  That this is what happened to me in 2016 in my very famous phone call with the Russian ambassador, Ambassador Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to Russia.
[00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.250]  And I had to phone call with him and I said, and I verbally, I mean, almost specifically said, we got to let cool heads prevail here.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:56.140]  Let the Trump administration come into office and we'll have a different conversation because we view things completely differently than the Obama administration.
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.739]  And you saw what happened to me.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.760]  I mean, they lied through their teeth about that.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.480]  Well, the same thing is going to start to happen in here.
[00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:16.159]  But we have to have conversations where sane people Leaders with good common sense who do not want to take us into World War III prevail.
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.520]  If we don't have that, we are going to have a very difficult couple of months here.
[00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:28.650]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:32.949]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:34.469]  All right, we're back live.
[00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.409]  General Flynn is coming on in minutes with emergency information.
[00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.129]  We are the closest to World War III, hands down.
[00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.909]  No military analyst denies it that we've ever been.
[00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.509]  Putin has said if the U.S. starts firing missiles into Russia, that Russia will officially be at war with the United States as their default position.
[00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.669]  He said that two months ago, a month ago, and today.
[00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:11.729]  And now it's all over the Russian news that they are fully at war with every NATO country, including the United States and the U.K. That's where we are right now on Tuesday, November 19, 2024, at 1134 Central Standard Time.
[00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:16.490]  Every one of your lives is in the most danger it's ever been.
[00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.689]  Our very futures all hang in the balance.
[00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.710]  And what did I tell you?
[00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:24.729]  Probably over a thousand times in the last year.
[00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:33.330]  If Trump is able to override the fraud, if we're able to do it, their main move will be bombing inside Russia to escalate into total war.
[00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.449]  This is absolute megalomaniac madness.
[00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.909]  This is Hitler-level crap.
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.180]  We have a degenerate, out-of-control establishment.
[00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.159]  Most of them don't even understand military systems.
[00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:57.280]  You've got a bunch of banker families represented by BlackRock, and their whole global Ponzi scheme's coming down.
[00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:04.770]  And we are trying to get Trump into stabilized stuff, and the U.S. will actually be dominant for another hundred years if we just do this.
[00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.069]  They sucked our power, used it to set up their global government.
[00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:09.569]  Now the whole world's turned against it.
[00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:18.310]  Their entire Great Reset is falling on its face, and their answer is put a gun to the American people in the world's head of nuclear Russian roulette.
[00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:26.850]  And this isn't like playing Russian roulette where you've got six cylinders and only one of them has got a.357 Magnum round in it.
[00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.339]  This is like playing Russian roulette with three bullets in it.
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.879]  You spin it.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.980]  It's like 50-50 right now.
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.879]  We're going to have a nuclear war.
[00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:36.879]  And that's the mainline analysis.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.560]  This is totally over-the-top, maximum insanity right now.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.420]  And Trump and others have come out and said, yeah, this is a military industrial complex trying to start World War III before he gets in office.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.899]  62 days.
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.220]  Congressman Massey says start impeachment of Biden immediately.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.500]  25th Amendment as well.
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.420]  That's exactly what General Flynn is saying.
[00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:06.639]  But the biggest thing we can do is pray to God for peace.
[00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:09.060]  Pray for sanity.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:19.240]  Biden announced two months ago he was going to start bombing Russia, and then it was in the Washington Post, but we already knew that almost all of his advisors that are military said, do not do this, including the Pentagon.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.180]  And then...
[00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.870]  Sunday at 2 p.m.
[00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.089]  Central, the New York Times says Biden has greenlit the bombing.
[00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:32.750]  And the bombing started in the middle of the night in Russia today.
[00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:38.589]  Roll the B-roll of one of the missiles hitting a Russian military base, an arms depot.
[00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.290]  And blowing it sky high in a giant orange mushroom cloud.
[00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:52.689]  So, that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:23.639]  Now, General Flynn, former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and former National Security Advisor to President Trump, is our guest joining us at this incredibly important moment in human history.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.660]  Representative Massey has called for immediate impeachment of the 25th Amendment.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.120]  So are other members of Congress.
[00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:31.779]  More of their statements are coming out now.
[00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:32.699]  We're getting those for you.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:42.420]  General Flynn has issued a post on X that we have reposted on Real Alex Jones that needs a billion views, where he lays out what needs to be done now.
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.040]  He put this out...
[00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.189]  General Flynn, thank you for joining us, sir.
[00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.569]  Please give us an update with your expertise on exactly what's happening.
[00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.410]  Yeah, so first of all, Alex, thanks for getting me on here quickly.
[00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.029]  You guys are great.
[00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:12.350]  This is an incredibly provocative action, and the provocation is not coming from the Kremlin this time, right?
[00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:30.379]  So all of these people that scream about Russia, Russia, Russia, You know, this is a provocation, a very offensive weapon system called ATACMS is the acronym, ATACMS. But this provocation that was begun probably about a week ago,
[00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:34.040]  we heard glimmers of it in the media, I think on Sunday.
[00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:42.079]  And then overnight, we've seen at least some number of these very offensive weapons fired into Russian territory.
[00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:50.430]  Now, You know, and I not only posted on X some things, because I get up this morning, you know, I was up late last night.
[00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:51.910]  I get up at about 3 o'clock this morning.
[00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:56.189]  I'm following all this stuff, and I'm starting to go through, okay, what the hell should happen?
[00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.089]  And what needs to happen right now?
[00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:11.250]  And I laid this out in a summary on my X post this morning, and then I just put out about an hour ago a substack, an article with a little bit more analysis.
[00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:26.620]  But bottom line is that this is where, and backing up just a hair, I just saw some breaking news where Vice President Harris, and I hope that this is not true, is taking a vacation to Hawaii.
[00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.689]  And I hope that's not the case.
[00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:42.590]  I know that the president and the vice president have all kinds of communications to be able to do anything, but we are in the midst of a potential World War III provocation that was initiated by us.
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:50.019]  And Putin did come out on Monday and made a statement on Monday, and I also posted that.
[00:08:50.279 --> 00:09:00.179]  So the first couple of things that have to happen, Congress must act right now, because if the White House is not going to act, Joe Biden is clearly not in charge.
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.879]  We have deep state operatives and deep state bureaucrats that I believe are making decisions.
[00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:12.200]  The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, Blinken and Austin, they're not clean here.
[00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:17.559]  I do think that Matt Gaetz ought to make a statement.
[00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:21.580]  I do think that President Trump has got to be contemplating making some phone calls.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.639]  I think that Matt Gaetz ought to make a statement.
[00:09:24.129 --> 00:09:39.289]  And let it be known right now that when he comes in to be the Attorney General, which he will be coming in to be the Attorney General, folks, that everybody that's involved in this decision-making process, going back to the decision even,
[00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:50.399]  provide these very offensive weapons to Ukraine, Keep all your communications, folks, because there's going to be an investigation and somebody's going to be held liable here.
[00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:55.080]  And so when it comes to President Biden, so what needs to happen?
[00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:59.259]  Harris needs to invoke the 25th Amendment immediately.
[00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:13.279]  Number two, the Congress for High Crimes and Misdemeanors, because there's no declaration of war here by Congress, and this is a very, very dangerous phase that we are going into.
[00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.139]  So I'm glad to hear about Massey.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.519]  Massey is absolutely 100% right.
[00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:27.409]  And there has to be, I mean, hell, and in my analysis that I wrote about, Trump was impeached for saying that the election was stolen.
[00:10:27.629 --> 00:10:30.250]  Trump was impeached for a perfectly good phone call.
[00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:31.549]  Two of them, actually.
[00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:48.289]  And so we're now talking about the provisioning of very highly sophisticated weapon systems that can only be used to acquire their targets when you use satellite systems that Ukraine doesn't have.
[00:10:48.509 --> 00:10:49.970]  Ukraine is not capable.
[00:10:50.129 --> 00:10:58.559]  The people of Ukraine right now, until they receive You know, years of training, in many cases, can't handle the types of weapons systems that we have.
[00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:01.919]  So we've got NATO complicity, for sure.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.120]  We've got White House complicity, for sure.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:16.450]  And so the outcome or the consequence Especially with what Putin said recently in his statement, everybody needs to go and listen to what he basically said.
[00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:30.850]  He said that there will be an action, there will be a consequence to this very provocative step that the West is taking because Putin recognized immediately that That Ukraine can't handle these.
[00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:36.250]  This is not a system in their inventory, nor is it a capability that they have.
[00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:44.950]  They have to use other means, meaning they have to use other countries to leverage the way that this weapon system can be used.
[00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.110]  So there is going to be a consequence.
[00:11:47.899 --> 00:11:51.919]  We're good to go.
[00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:12.259]  And instead of fighting for peace as Donald Trump, as President Trump has continued to say, what is happening is these people are taking us to war.
[00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:15.179]  Last thing, Alex, and I'll get off my high horse here.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:25.019]  Last Wednesday, Trump met with Biden and Biden, like Obama told him back in 2016, this is going to be a peaceful transfer of power.
[00:12:25.669 --> 00:12:28.490]  It's like sticking a needle into Trump's eye, right?
[00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:39.330]  Three days later, we get the report that ATACMS is now going to be used and it's authorized to be used by this White House in Ukraine to fire into Russian territory.
[00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.710]  That is not a peaceful transfer of power.
[00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.990]  And, you know, and I can almost guarantee that nobody knew that on the Trump team.
[00:12:48.149 --> 00:12:52.309]  This happened and then the firing of these weapon systems over the last 24 hours.
[00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:57.379]  And it's just like I... I wrote about in the longer analysis that I provided.
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:08.220]  If these types of weapon systems were put in Mexico and they could target Corpus Christi or Austin, Texas, where you're at, I think, you know, Tucson, I mean, what would we say about it?
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.259]  How would we respond to it?
[00:13:10.419 --> 00:13:20.909]  And instead of people taking the peace agreement That, you know, or going to peace talks based on something that I know is on the table.
[00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:25.210]  And Putin has actually accepted having a conversation about these.
[00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:27.250]  Apparently Zelensky has not.
[00:13:27.409 --> 00:13:40.289]  So this White House, the Biden White House with Harris, They are not going to a peaceful transition of power here into the Trump presidency.
[00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:46.029]  This is a very, very dangerous stage that we have been taken to.
[00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:48.429]  And, you know, I'm concerned.
[00:13:48.649 --> 00:13:49.269]  I'm concerned right now.
[00:13:49.389 --> 00:14:00.289]  Trump is going to have to get on the phone with world leaders now, and he's probably going to have to put himself into the president mode, even though there's, like we always say, there's only one president at a time.
[00:14:00.429 --> 00:14:04.370]  But Trump needs to say, we need to have cool heads prevail here.
[00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:07.690]  We cannot have these provocative measures taken.
[00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.269]  And I wrote about this in the paper as well.
[00:14:10.889 --> 00:14:21.509]  That this is what happened to me in 2016 in my very famous phone call with the Russian ambassador, Ambassador Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to Russia.
[00:14:21.529 --> 00:14:28.720]  And I had to phone call with him and I said, and I verbally, I mean, almost specifically said, We got to let cool heads prevail here.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:39.580]  Let the Trump administration come into office and we'll have a different conversation because we view things completely differently than the Obama administration.
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.179]  And you saw what happened to me.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.200]  I mean, they lied through their teeth about that.
[00:14:45.559 --> 00:14:47.919]  Well, the same thing is going to start to happen in here.
[00:14:48.379 --> 00:14:59.580]  But we have to have conversations where sane people Leaders with good common sense who do not want to take us into World War III prevail.
[00:14:59.759 --> 00:15:08.639]  If we don't have that, we are going to have a very difficult couple of months here because at the end of the day, Putin has to make decisions for his own sovereignty.
[00:15:09.059 --> 00:15:23.500]  And when you start to think about the give and take here, there's going to be a give and it's going to come from You know, the Russian side of the lines here because we have provoked them.
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.519]  The provocation has come from us, not from the Kremlin.
[00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:29.200]  And that's what I want people to understand.
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:36.399]  And in general, a limited time we have with you, you're one of the best people we could interview in the world on a subject like this.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.940]  Obviously, most of it's classified doctrine and things, but a lot of it's public as well.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.320]  Just to be clear, I've studied nuclear doctrine because it's fascinating.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.059]  It's so dangerous.
[00:15:44.419 --> 00:15:45.879]  It's one of the things I've looked into deeply.
[00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:47.629]  But you alluded to this.
[00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.750]  If Russia did anything like this, we'd already be at full war with them.
[00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:55.129]  If they moved missiles up, and this is what their military has been warning about for a year.
[00:15:55.490 --> 00:16:05.590]  Putin said two months ago, he said, if you move nuclear-capable missiles that they can swap out with hydrogen warheads in 10 minutes, and you start firing these conventional missiles in...
[00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:09.490]  We know that that will train us to accept a strike by these.
[00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:14.929]  Even if we accept that in the escalation, then they can easily load hydrogen bombs on them.
[00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:20.690]  And then we won't know when those get launched, and they'll take out our response systems.
[00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.450]  And we know the U.S. has a first strike policy.
[00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.309]  Russia has changed to a first strike policy now, just now.
[00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:30.190]  And I have the policy here from the Pentagon right in front of me.
[00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:33.110]  I know you know about it, but for listeners, yes, we have a first strike policy.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.639]  We're good to go.
[00:16:53.909 --> 00:16:59.730]  We're good to go.
[00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:20.569]  We have to nuke, because that's the only thing we've got that can stop this.
[00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:22.730]  We have to take that as we're under nuclear attack.
[00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.430]  Can you explain that to the general public, please, sir?
[00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.789]  Let me just, a quick historical context.
[00:17:30.089 --> 00:17:31.470]  Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:39.549]  When Russia was going to place, you know, potential nuclear weapons into Cuba, right?
[00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:44.410]  You know, I mean, this is a, there's some similarities here is what I'm saying.
[00:17:44.609 --> 00:17:54.900]  So this idea about what you're describing as these You know, as the potential nuclear policies for competing nations.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.740]  And there are nations in Europe as well, right, that are part of this umbrella.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:08.880]  So, you know, when people say there's, you know, when they talk about tactical, use of tactical nuclear weapons, and I think I've actually been on your show before talking about this.
[00:18:09.329 --> 00:18:13.109]  I tell people, look, there's no such thing as a tactical nuclear weapon.
[00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:17.890]  The burst radius, the consequences of a nuclear attack and nuclear use of a weapon.
[00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:29.829]  So now you have a weapon system that's been provided to Ukraine, and the only way that they're able to use it in as sophisticated a way as they're using it is if they have Our help.
[00:18:30.089 --> 00:18:32.390]  I mean, it's undeniable.
[00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.390]  So, Putin is going to look at this whole thing.
[00:18:35.609 --> 00:18:38.849]  He hasn't had a phone call with Joe Biden in years.
[00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:40.710]  I mean, I think we've already shown that.
[00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:46.829]  There is a, again, there is a peace agreement on the table.
[00:18:47.619 --> 00:18:55.240]  And we have provocation from Zelensky in terms of his verbiage and what he's saying.
[00:18:55.599 --> 00:19:04.460]  So we are having ourselves, and I brought it down there, we are sleepwalking with Joe Biden at the helm.
[00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:07.440]  We are sleepwalking into World War III here, folks.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:23.220]  And the potential for a nuclear exchange, which nuclear weapons have been on the table and discussed by NATO, been discussed by Joe Biden, and been discussed by Putin in the last year,
[00:19:23.299 --> 00:19:28.000]  year and a half, to include adjustments to the Russian nuclear policy.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:36.589]  So when they make adjustments to their nuclear policy, so from the standpoint of So what?
[00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:46.470]  Well, if I was back in the Defense Department, I would be tapping into every single intel resource to find out what is Putin doing with his nuclear arsenal.
[00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:58.130]  One other thing that I'll draw to your attention, Alex, and I put it on my ex-post this morning, there's an undersea nuclear cable that was cut Up in the Baltic Sea.
[00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:04.990]  Very, very interesting that that has been reported and described.
[00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:05.410]  Yeah.
[00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:10.470]  So you kind of say, okay, these are the kinds of things that happen.
[00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:13.890]  We used to call them in the military the road to war, right?
[00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.809]  Incidents, indicators, and events that happen.
[00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:17.410]  Escalators.
[00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.569]  Okay, what does this mean?
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.319]  Yeah, big, big deal.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:27.220]  Because that particular cable, what we have to examine is, what does that cable, what is it used for?
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.519]  Is it just a communications cable?
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.440]  Is it a censorship cable?
[00:20:31.559 --> 00:20:40.920]  I mean, I don't mean censorship, like eliminating something that you're saying, but is it a cable that does sensing at the bottom of the ocean?
[00:20:41.079 --> 00:20:45.059]  So there's a lot of activities playing out right now.
[00:20:45.979 --> 00:20:50.539]  And when you look at somebody's nuclear arsenal, and there's the nuclear triad, right?
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:57.140]  Subs, ground-based, or basically CONUS-based in our case, or Russia-based.
[00:20:57.299 --> 00:20:59.059]  And then you have your bombers, right?
[00:20:59.119 --> 00:20:59.779]  Your bomber fleet.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.119]  Those are sort of the triad, and we both have them.
[00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:05.599]  The other thing that I want to also bring out...
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:11.640]  Is I would be looking at where are the Chinese submarine fleet?
[00:21:11.819 --> 00:21:15.640]  And where's the Chinese bomber fleet right now?
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.079]  General, that's where I was going next.
[00:21:17.519 --> 00:21:18.440]  And you already know this.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.740]  Putin has put their forces on high nuclear alert.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.039]  They've been doing nuclear strike drills the last two weeks.
[00:21:24.039 --> 00:21:26.819]  Zelensky shot his mouth off and said they were two weeks away from nukes.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.759]  So Zelensky's threatening that he may have nukes.
[00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:36.710]  And then you've got them rolling missiles up to the border and now hitting Russia with missiles that can quickly be swapped out with nukes.
[00:21:36.869 --> 00:21:42.009]  I mean, this doesn't look like they're trying to provocate Russia into something.
[00:21:43.849 --> 00:21:58.869]  No, Alex, this is, I mean, that's why in the title of that article that you just showed, we have got to show the world, and particularly the United States right now, must take a different posture.
[00:21:59.009 --> 00:22:02.730]  Otherwise, we're going to find ourselves with a consequence that is irreversible.
[00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:14.240]  I want to remind people, over the last hundred years, from the Bolshevik Revolution post-World War I, to this day, to this time frame, We have been in a couple of world wars.
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.500]  We've been in some major, major regional wars.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.400]  We've had the Cuban Missile Crisis, as I talked about earlier.
[00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:23.579]  We are now in another period of time where we're betting on that guy right there.
[00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:27.339]  I mean, we're betting on this guy and a place called Ukraine.
[00:22:27.819 --> 00:22:34.200]  And I think if everybody with any common sense has figured out, Ukraine is a money laundering sieve.
[00:22:34.539 --> 00:22:39.440]  And we are being taken to the cleaners and have been taken to the cleaners for far too long.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:48.680]  And that's why President Donald J. Trump had the mandate that he did in the election, in our recent presidential election, to get us out of these wars, to fight for peace.
[00:22:48.799 --> 00:22:50.559]  And generally, in closing, I know you've got to go.
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.599]  You've been incredibly gracious.
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.240]  I hear you're going to be here probably in the studio next week.
[00:22:53.319 --> 00:22:55.299]  We're still here on multiple fronts.
[00:22:56.099 --> 00:22:56.980]  Just in closing.
[00:22:57.549 --> 00:22:59.309]  To be clear, you hit the nail on the head here.
[00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:03.369]  We don't even know who's in charge, but we know it's Blinken.
[00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:04.670]  It's the Defense Department.
[00:23:05.069 --> 00:23:07.970]  And they need to know that we know they're doing this.
[00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:12.029]  And Biden said two months ago when he said, yeah, we've authorized the missiles, but I don't want the U.S. to get the blame.
[00:23:12.329 --> 00:23:13.710]  That's what Keira Starmer said.
[00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:15.670]  They're going to get the blame.
[00:23:15.869 --> 00:23:16.390]  They need to know.
[00:23:16.529 --> 00:23:16.809]  We're aware.
[00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:18.549]  Do you agree with Don Jr.
[00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:25.650]  and others saying the military-industrial complex wants to either start a war to create a crisis to keep Trump out or hand him a full-scale war?
[00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.130]  I mean, that's prima facie what's happening.
[00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:27.450]  Do you agree?
[00:23:29.009 --> 00:23:33.670]  I 100% agree with the post that actually Don Jr.
[00:23:33.849 --> 00:23:34.609]  put out recently.
[00:23:34.849 --> 00:23:42.210]  And I agree so much that I added it into the more detailed analysis that I provided.
[00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.750]  But yeah, this is really...
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.319]  Seriously dangerous.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.440]  We have the wrong guy in office.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.839]  Kamala can do her constitutional duty.
[00:23:51.079 --> 00:23:52.319]  Show us what she's got.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.619]  But I don't think she's got the capability.
[00:23:54.859 --> 00:23:57.339]  And Congress, they definitely need to act.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.700]  And they need to act now.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.099]  This conversation has to be taken up to a vastly higher level.
[00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:13.480]  And to make sure that people around the world, particularly Russia and China, understand that this is not something that the people of the United States voted for.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:14.319]  Okay?
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:21.079]  And we are being led by- And sir, as you said, Biden said a year ago he hasn't talked to Putin since Putin invaded.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:21.619]  In a couple of years.
[00:24:21.779 --> 00:24:22.339]  That's insane.
[00:24:22.539 --> 00:24:22.759]  Right.
[00:24:24.079 --> 00:24:24.539]  All right.
[00:24:24.579 --> 00:24:24.900]  It's insane.
[00:24:25.339 --> 00:24:26.279]  It's outrageous.
[00:24:26.519 --> 00:24:27.339]  It's outrageous.
[00:24:27.619 --> 00:24:29.619]  So, Alex, I gotta- Thank you.
[00:24:29.619 --> 00:24:30.160]  Thank you so much.
[00:24:30.299 --> 00:24:31.920]  And hopefully I'll see you next week.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:32.799]  God bless you, sir.
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:33.180]  Thank you.
[00:24:34.869 --> 00:24:36.690]  Here's the facts in 60 seconds.
[00:24:37.289 --> 00:24:41.829]  The Justice Department came into my bankruptcy and has tried to shut us down twice since May.
[00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:43.650]  The latest case was last week.
[00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:45.490]  The judge shut them down.
[00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:46.549]  They were thrown out of the building.
[00:24:47.049 --> 00:24:47.890]  Crimes were committed.
[00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:48.849]  It's very clear.
[00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.750]  They're in a lot of trouble.
[00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:51.609]  I filed counter lawsuits.
[00:24:52.009 --> 00:24:52.849]  You name it.
[00:24:53.789 --> 00:24:55.190]  Infowarsstore.com is in limbo.
[00:24:55.329 --> 00:24:56.970]  If you order there, you'll get your products.
[00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:11.250]  But, thealexjonesstore.com is our great sponsors in Arkansas with t-shirts and great supplements that are funding not just Infowars, but the Alex Jones Network in case this gets shut down at another hearing next week.

[00:25:39.579 --> 00:25:43.700]  You are keeping me on the air one way or another, and we need the funds.
[00:25:44.079 --> 00:25:48.759]  Over the weekend, folks, we saw our funds cut in half, and people told us, well, we don't want to give it to The Onion.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.660]  The Onion does not own me.
[00:25:50.779 --> 00:25:52.920]  They do not own the Alex Jones Store.
[00:26:10.399 --> 00:26:14.980]  We are kicking New World Order ass and they are fighting us.
[00:26:15.359 --> 00:26:17.140]  I can beat them, but not without your help.

[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.279]  It's not owned by the Onion.
[00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:26.119]  It's not owned by the Easter Bunny.
[00:26:26.279 --> 00:26:34.119]  It's owned by great patriots in Arkansas with their own factories, making their own knives, t-shirts, and then private labeling top supplements and selling them to you.
